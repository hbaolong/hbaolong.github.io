Growth that results only in volume and does not produce higher overall productivities is fat—it should be sweated.

只导致产量增长而不产生更高的整体生产率的增长是脂肪，它应该出汗

Management needs to think through the minimum of growth that its company requires.
[2K[1G

管理层需要考虑公司所需要的最低增长

What is the minimum of growth without which the company would actually lose strength, vigor, and ability to perform, if not to survive? A company needs a viable market standing.
[2K[1G

什么是最低的增长，没有它，公司实际上会失去力量，活力和能力，如果不生存，一个公司需要一个可行的市场地位

Otherwise it soon becomes marginal.
[2K[1G

否则，它很快就会变得无足轻重

It soon becomes, in effect, the wrong size.
[2K[1G

它很快就变成了错误的大小

And if the market expands, whether domestically or worldwide, a company has to grow with the market to maintain its viability.
[2K[1G

如果市场扩大，无论是国内还是全球，公司都必须随着市场的发展而增长，以保持其生存能力

At times a company therefore needs a very high minimum growth rate.
[2K[1G

因此，有时一家公司需要一个非常高的最低增长率

A business needs to distinguish between the wrong kind of growth and the right kind of growth, between muscle, fat, and cancer.
[2K[1G

企业需要区分正确的增长和错误的增长，肌肉脂肪和癌症

The rules are simple: Any growth that, within a short period of time, results in an overall increase in the total productivities of the enterprise’s resources is healthy growth.
[2K[1G

规则很简单，任何能在短时间内使企业资源的总生产率全面提高的增长都是健康的增长

It should be fed and supported.
[2K[1G

它应该得到喂养和支持

But growth that results only in volume and does not, within a fairly short period of time, produce higher over-all productivities is fat.
[2K[1G

但是，如果增长只带来产量，而不能在相当短的时间内产生更高的总体生产率，那就是肥胖

Any increase in volume that does not lead to higher overall productivity should be sweated off again.
[2K[1G

任何不能提高整体生产率的产量增加都应该再次消耗掉

Finally, any increase in volume that leads to reduced productivities should be eliminated by radical surgery—fast.
[2K[1G

最后，任何导致生产力下降的体积增加都应该通过根治性手术迅速消除
