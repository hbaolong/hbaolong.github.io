<p>Lucy has a new pet. Do you know what kind of bird it is? Lucy calls
her Polly.</p>
<p>Polly can say,“Poor Poll! Poor Poll! Polly wants a cracker;”and she
can mew like a cat.</p>
<p>But Polly and the cat are not good friends. One day Polly flew down,
and lit upon the cat’s back when she was asleep.</p>
<p>I think she knew the cat would not like that, and she did it to tease
her.</p>
<p>When Lucy pets the cat, Polly flies up into the old apple tree, and
will not come when she calls her. Then Lucy says,“What a silly
bird!”</p>

<p>“I never saw such children,”said the old hen.“You don’t try at
all.”</p>
<p>“We can’t jump so far, mother. Indeed we can’t, we can’t!”chirped the
little chickens.</p>
<p>“Well,”said the old hen,“I must give it up.”So she jumped back to the
bank, and walked slowly home with her brood.</p>
<p>“I think mother asked too much of us,”said one little chicken to the
others.</p>
<p>“Well, I tried,”said Chippy.</p>
<p>“We didn’t,”said the others;“it was of no use to try.”</p>
<p>When they got home, the old hen began to look about for something to
eat. She soon found, near the back door, a piece of bread.</p>
<p>So she called the chickens, and they all ran up to her, each one
trying to get a bite at the piece of bread.</p>
<p>“No, no!”said the old hen.“This bread is for Chippy. He is the only
one of my children that really tried to jump to the stone.”</p>

<p>“我想，妈妈对我们要求太高了。”一只小鸡对其他的小鸡说。</p>
<p>“我尝试了。”芝比说。</p>
<p>“我们还没有。”其他的小鸡说，“但尝试也没有用。”</p>
<p>当它们到家时，老母鸡开始到处找吃的。不久，它就发现在靠后门的地方有一块面包。</p>
<p>于是，它就招呼孩子们，它们都向她跑来，每只小鸡都想咬一口面包。</p>

<p>3.但他知道，时间并不总是用来玩的。每分钟，每小时，每天都十分珍贵。</p>
<p>4．每次玩完之后，他就回家。先洗脸、洗手、梳头，然后帮妈妈干活。干完活后看书或在小黑板上写字。</p>
<p>5．他经常说：“一次专心做一件事。”只有完成作业后，他才去玩。他从不边学边玩。</p>

<p>Sunbeam cheered Susie gave</p>
<p>gladness unless name gate</p>
<p>1．Susie Sunbeam was not her real name; that was Susan Brown. But
every one called her Susie Sunbeam, because she had such a sweet,
smiling face, and always brought brightness with her when she came.</p>
<p>2．Her grandfather first gave her this name, and it seemed to fit the
little girl so nicely that soon it took the place of her own.</p>
<p>3．Even when a baby, Susie laughed and crowed from morning till
night. No one ever heard her cry unless she was sick or hurt.</p>
<p>4．When she had learned to walk, she loved to go about the house and
get things for her mother, and in this way save her as many steps as she
could.</p>
<p>5．She would sit by her mother’s side for an hour at a time, and ask
her ever so many questions, or she would take her new book and read.</p>
<p>6．Susie was always pleasant in her play with other children. She
never used an unkind word, but tried to do whatever would please her
playmates best.</p>
<p>7．One day, a poor little girl with a very ragged dress was going by
and Susie heard some children teasing her and making fun of her.</p>
<p>8．She at once ran out to the gate, and asked the poor little girl to
come in. “What are you crying for?” Susie asked.</p>
<p>9．“Because they all laugh at me,” she said.</p>
<p>10．Then Susie took the little girl into the house. She cheered her
up with kind words, and gave her a nice dress and a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>11．This brought real joy and gladness to the poor child, and she,
too, thought that Susie was rightly called Sunbeam.</p>

<p>3．即使是在苏西婴儿时，她也是从早到晚欢笑伴随。除了有病或受伤，其他时候没有人听到过她的哭声。</p>
<p>4．当她学走路时，便喜欢帮妈妈满屋子拿东西，这样妈妈省了很多力气。</p>
<p>5．有时候她会坐在妈妈身边，花整整一个小时问很多问题；有时候则捧着她的书看。</p>
<p>6．和其他小朋友玩耍时，苏西总是欢欢喜喜。她从来不说不友好的话，尽量让小伙伴们高兴。</p>
<p>7．一天，当一位衣衫褴褛的贫穷小姑娘路过时，苏西听到别人在嘲笑她，拿她逗乐。</p>
<p>8．苏西立刻跑到大门口，让那个可怜的小姑娘进屋。“你为什么哭呀？”苏西问道。</p>
<p>9．“他们都取笑我。”小姑娘说。</p>
<p>10．于是，苏西将小姑娘领进屋里，用亲切的话鼓励她，并送给她一件漂亮的连衣裙和一双鞋。</p>

<p>HENRY, THE BOOTBLACK</p>
<p>擦鞋童亨利</p>
<p>1．Henry was a kind, good boy. His father was dead, and his mother
was very poor. He had a little sister about two years old.</p>
<p>2．He wanted to help his mother, for she could not always earn enough
to buy food for her little family.</p>
<p>3．One day, a man gave him a dollar for finding a pocketbook which he
had lost.</p>
<p>4．Henry might have kept all the money, for no one saw him when he
found it. But his mother had taught him to be honest, and never to keep
what did not belong to him.</p>
<p>5．With the dollar he bought a box, three brushes, and some blacking.
He then went to the corner of the street, and said to every one whose
boots did not look nice, “Black your boots, sir, please?”</p>
<p>6．He was so polite that gentlemen soon began to notice him, and to
let him black their boots. The first day he brought home fifty cents,
which he gave to his mother to buy food with.</p>
<p>7．When he gave her the money, she said, as she dropped a tear of
joy, “You are a dear, good boy, Henry. I did not know how I could earn
enough to buy bread with, but now I think we can manage to get along
quite well.”</p>
<p>8．Henry worked all the day, and went to school in the evening. He
earned almost enough to support his mother and his little sister.</p>

<p>4．当时，亨利可以留下所有捡到的钱，因为他捡钱包时没人看见。但妈妈教过他为人要诚实，绝不能拿不属于自己的东西。</p>
<p>5．他用那一块钱买了一个盒子、三把刷子和一些黑鞋油。然后，他走到街角，对路过时靴子上有尘土的人说：“先生，让我为您擦擦鞋好吗？”</p>
<p>6．他文明有礼的举动让人们立刻注意到他。他擦皮鞋的生意就这样做起来了。第一天，他赚了五毛钱，回家后交给妈妈买吃的。</p>
<p>7．当他把钱交给妈妈时，妈妈流下了幸福的泪水：“亨利，好孩子，你真可爱。以前我不知道如何才能赚足够的钱买面包，现在我知道我们能做到了。”</p>

<p>1．A boy was once sent from home to take a basket of things to his
grandmother.</p>
<p>2．The basket was so full that it was very heavy. So his little
brother went with him, to help carry the load.</p>
<p>3．They put a pole under the handle of the basket, and each then took
hold of an end of the pole. In this way they could carry the basket very
nicely.</p>
<p>4．Now the older boy thought, “My brother Tom does not know about
this pole.”</p>
<p>5．“If I slip the basket near him, his side will be heavy, and mine
light; but if the basket is in the middle of the pole, it will be as
heavy for me as it is for him.”</p>
<p>6．“Tom does not know this as I do. But I will not do it. It would be
wrong, and I will not do what is wrong.”</p>
<p>7．Then he slipped the basket quite near his own end of the pole. His
load was now heavier than that of his little brother.</p>
<p>8．Yet he was happy; for he felt that he had done right. Had he
deceived his brother, he would not have felt at all happy.</p>

<p>5．“如果我把篮子滑得离他近一些，他那端就会重一些，我这端就会轻一些。但如果篮子在中间，两端就一样重。”</p>
<p>6．“虽然汤姆不懂得这个道理，但我不能这么做。这么做是错误的，我不能做错误的事。”</p>

<p>1．The kingbird is not bigger than a robin.</p>
<p>2．He eats flies, and worms, and bugs, and berries.</p>
<p>3．He builds his nest in a tree, near some house.</p>
<p>4．When there are young ones in the nest, he sits on the top of a
tree near them.</p>
<p>5．He watches to see that no bird comes to hurt them or their
mother.</p>
<p>6．If a hawk, a crow, or even an eagle comes near, he makes a dash at
it.</p>
<p>7．Though he is so small, he is brave, and he is also very
active.</p>
<p>8．He never fails to drive off other birds from his nest.</p>
<p>9．He flies around and around the eagle, and suddenly strikes him
with his sharp bill.</p>
<p>10．He strikes at his eye, and then darts away before the eagle can
catch him.</p>
<p>11．Or he strikes from behind, and is off again before the eagle can
turn round.</p>
<p>12．In a short time, the great eagle is tired of such hard blows, and
flies away. He is very glad to get rid of his foe.</p>

up.”</p>
<p>5．Thus, they at once began to quarrel about the nut.</p>
<p>6．As they could not agree whose it should be, they called an older
boy, and asked him.</p>
<p>7．The older boy said, “I will settle this quarrel.”</p>
<p>8．He took the nut, and broke the shell. He then took out the kernel,
and divided the shell into two parts, as nearly equal as he could.</p>

<p>1．Bees live in a house that is called a hive. They are of three
kinds,—workers, drones, and queens.</p>
<p>2．Only one queen can live in each hive. If she is lost or dead, the
other bees will stop their work.</p>
<p>3．They are very wise and busy little creatures. They all join
together to build cells of wax for their honey.</p>
<p>4．Each bee takes its proper place, and does its own work. Some go
out and gather honey from the flowers; others stay at home and work
inside the hive.</p>
<p>5．The cells which they build, are all of one shape and size, and no
room is left between them.</p>
<p>6．The cells are not round, but have six sides.</p>
<p>7．Did you ever look into a glass hive to see the bees while at work?
It is pleasant to see how busy they always are.</p>
<p>8．But the drones do not work. Before winter comes, all the drones
are driven from the hive or killed, that they may not eat the honey
which they did not gather.</p>
<p>9．It is not quite safe for children to handle bees. They have sharp
stings that they know well how to use in their defense.</p>

<p>3．蜜蜂是既聪明又勤劳的小动物。它们一起合作，建造蜡质蜂巢储存蜂蜜。</p>
<p>4．每只蜜蜂都各就各位，各司其职。一些蜜蜂出去采蜜，其他蜜蜂则留在蜂房里工作。</p>

<p>THE TORN DOLL</p>
<p>撕破的布娃娃</p>
<p>1．Mary Armstrong was a pretty little girl, but she was heedless
about some things.</p>
<p>2．Her way of leaving her books and playthings just where she had
used them last, gave her mother much trouble in picking them up and
putting them in their proper places.</p>
<p>3．She had often told Mary the evil effects of being so careless. Her
books became spoiled, and her toys broken.</p>
<p>4．But worse than this was the growing habit of carelessness, which
would be of great harm to her all her life. It would make her unhappy,
and would annoy her friends.</p>
<p>5．One day Mary and her mother went out into their pleasant yard, to
spend an hour in the open air. Mrs. Armstrong took her work with
her.</p>
<p>6．Mary ran about and played with Dash, her pet dog, and was having a
happy time.</p>
<p>7．But in a corner of the yard she found her nicest doll all torn and
broken, and its dress covered with mud.</p>
<p>8．She knew, at once, that Dash had done this, and she scolded him
harshly.</p>
<p>9．Carrying the broken doll to her mamma. she showed it to her, and
could hardly keep from crying.</p>
<p>10．Mrs. Armstrong asked Mary if she had not left the doll on the
porch where Dash could easily get it; and Mary had to answer, “Yes,
ma’am.”</p>
<p>11．“Then you must not blame the dog, Mary, for he does not know it
is wrong for him to play with your doll. I hope this will be a lesson to
you hereafter, to put your things away when you are through
playing.”</p>
<p>12．“I will try,” said Mary. And her mother promised to mend the doll
as well as she could.</p>

<p>otherwise woven cloth wool rub</p>
<p>1．Sheep are washed and sheared some time in the month of June. This
should be done quite early in the month, before the hot days begin.</p>
<p>2．It is fine sport for those who look on, but not much fun for the
sheep.</p>
<p>3．It is best for the sheep to have the wool taken off; otherwise
they would suffer in the summer time.</p>
<p>4．When the time comes for washing the sheep, they are driven to a
pond or a little river.</p>
<p>5．Then they are thrown into the water, one at a time. The men who
are in the water catch them, and squeeze the wet wool with their hands
to get the dirt all out of it.</p>
<p>6．When the wool is thoroughly dried, the sheep are taken to the
shearer; and he cuts off the wool with a large pair of shears.</p>
<p>7．It is then dyed, spun, and woven into cloth.</p>
<p>8．In a short time, before the cold winter comes, new wool grows out
on the sheep. By the coming of spring there is so much, that it must be
cut off again.</p>

<p>PATTY AND THE SQUIRREL</p>
<p>帕蒂和松鼠</p>
<p>1．Little Patty lives in a log house near a great forest. She has no
sisters, and her big brothers are away all day helping their father.</p>
<p>2．But Patty is never lonely; for, though the nearest house is miles
away, she has many little friends. Here are two of them that live in the
woods.</p>
<p>3．But how did Patty teach them to be so tame? Patty came to the
woods often, and was always so quiet and gentle that the squirrels soon
found they need not be afraid of her.</p>
<p>4．She brought her bread and milk to eat under the trees, and was
sure to leave crumbs for the squirrels.</p>
<p>5．When they came near, she sat very still and watched them. So,
little by little, she made them her friends, till, at last, they would
sit on her shoulder, and eat from her hand.</p>
<p>6．Squirrels build for themselves summer houses. These are made of
leaves, and sticks, and moss. They are nice and cool for summer, but
would never do for the winter cold and snow.</p>
<p>7．So these wise little people find a hollow in an old tree. They
make it warm and snug with soft moss and leaves; and here the squirrels
live all through the long winter.</p>

<p>萨姆和哈里</p>
<p>1．One fine summer afternoon, Sam was walking home from school. He
went along slowly, reading a book.</p>
<p>2．Sam had spent all his money for the book, but he was a happy
boy.</p>
<p>3．At length he came into the highroad, where there was a gate. A
blind man stood, holding it open.</p>
<p>4．The poor man said, “Please give me a few cents to buy some bread!”
But Sam gave him nothing .</p>
<p>5．What! did Sam give the poor blind man nothing? Yes; for, as I told
you, he had spent all his money.</p>
<p>6．So Sam walked on, very sad. Soon after, a fine carriage came up,
and in it were Harry and his mother.</p>
<p>7．The blind man stood, and held out his hat. “Let us give the poor
man something,” said Harry to his mother.</p>
<p>8．His mother gave him some cents. Harry took them, but did not put
them into the man’s hat.</p>
<p>9．He threw them into the hedge as far as he could. The poor man
could not find them, for, you know, he was blind.</p>
<p>10．Sam had turned back to look at the fine carriage. He saw Harry
throw the cents into the hedge; so he came back at once, and looked for
the money until he found it all for the blind man.</p>
<p>11．This took so long a time, that he almost lost his supper.</p>

<p>5．什么？萨姆什么都没给那个可怜人吗？是的，因为就如我所说的，他买书花光了他所有的钱。</p>
<p>6．因此，萨姆非常难过地继续往前走。过了一会儿，一辆非常好的马车赶了上来，哈里和他的妈妈坐在里面。</p>
<p>7．这个盲人站在那里，手里拿着帽子。“我们给这个可怜的人些钱吧，”哈里对他的妈妈说。</p>
<p>8．哈里的妈妈给了他几分钱。哈里拿着钱，但他没有把钱投到那个盲人的帽子里。</p>
<p>9．哈里使尽全力，把钱扔到了远处的篱笆里。那个可怜人肯定找不到，因为你知道的，他看不见。</p>
<p>10．萨姆转过身看着那辆漂亮的马车。他看到哈里把钱扔到了篱笆里，因此他赶快跑回去在草丛里找到钱，并且把钱交给了那个盲人。</p>

<p>1．The tiger is a giant cat. His body is nearly covered with black
stripes.</p>
<p>2．Unlike the lion, he runs so fast that the swiftest horse can not
overtake him. He goes over the ground by making bounds or springs, one
after another.</p>
<p>3．By night, as well as by day, the tiger watches for his prey. With
a frightful roar, he will seize a man, and carry him off.</p>
<p>4．Have you ever thought what use whiskers are to cats? Lions have
great whiskers, and so have tigers and all other animals of the cat
kind.</p>
<p>5．Whenever you find an animal with whiskers like the cat’s, you may
be sure that animal steals softly among branches and thick bushes.</p>
<p>6．By the slightest touch on the tiger’s whiskers, he knows when
there is anything in his road.</p>
<p>7．A few years ago, some English officers went out to hunt. When
coming home from their day’s sport, they found a little tiger
kitten.</p>
<p>8．They took it with them and tied it, with a collar and chain, to
the pole of their tent. It played about, to the delight of all who saw
it.</p>

frightened them greatly. It was the roar of a tiger.</p>

sharp cry, it answered the voice outside.</p>
<p>11．All at once, a large tigress bounded into the middle of the tent.
She caught her kitten by the neck, and broke the chain which bound
it.</p>
<p>12．Then turning to the door of the tent, she dashed away as suddenly
as she had come.</p>

<p>4．你有没有想过猫的胡须的用处？与老虎和其他的猫科动物一样，狮子也有很长的胡须。</p>
<p>5．每当你看到长着猫一样胡须的动物，就会发现，他们常常偷偷地藏在树枝和茂密的灌木丛里。</p>
<p>6．借助它的胡须轻微的触觉，老虎知晓何时会有什么东西出现在它的周围。</p>

better, and the light brighter.”</p>
<p>5．“But, mother,” said Mary, “ I do not see why we are happier now

<p>WILLIE AND BOUNCE</p>
<p>威利和鲍恩斯</p>
<p>sent store Bounce floating</p>
<p>load circle ripples catching</p>
<p>cake blocks strolled however</p>
<p>1．Two fast friends were Willie Brown and his little dog Bounce.
Willie could never think of taking a walk without Bounce. Cake and play
were equally shared between them.</p>
<p>2．Willie taught his dog many cunning tricks, and often said that
Bounce could do almost anything in the world but talk.</p>
<p>3．There came a time, however, when Bounce really told Willie’s
father something, though he could not talk. Let me tell you how he did
this.</p>
<p>4．It was on a bright summer afternoon. Willie had strolled with
Bounce down to the river, which was not more than two blocks from his
father’s store.</p>
<p>5．Willie began to throw stones into the water, and to watch the
ripples as they made one circle after another.</p>
<p>6．Bounce lay on the grass, watching the flies that buzzed around his
nose, and catching any that came too near.</p>
<p>7．There were some logs floating in the river near the shore. Willie
jumped upon one of them, to see if he could throw a stone across the
river.</p>
<p>8．He drew back, and sent the stone with all his might. Just as it
left his hand, the log turned, and he fell into the water.</p>
<p>9．He was very much frightened, for he did not know how to swim, and
there was no one to hear, though he called as loud as he could for
help.</p>

<p>1．威利·布朗和他的小狗鲍恩斯是好朋友。威利无法想象没有鲍恩斯一起散步的情形。他们常常平分蛋糕，一起玩耍。</p>
<p>2．威利教给鲍恩斯很多小把戏。他说这个世界上除了说话没有鲍恩斯做不到的事情。</p>
<p>3．有一次，尽管鲍恩斯不能说话，但他确实告诉了威利的爸爸一些事情。让我来告诉你它是怎样做到的。</p>
<p>4．那是一个夏日的午后，威利与鲍恩斯在离他爸爸商店不超过两个街区的一条河边散步。</p>
<p>5．威利开始往河里扔石头，然后看着波纹一圈圈地扩展开来。</p>
<p>6．鲍恩斯躺在草地上，看着苍蝇绕着它的鼻子嗡嗡地飞，还不停地抓那些飞的很近的苍蝇。</p>
<p>7．在河中靠岸边的地方漂浮着一些圆木。威利跳上一根圆木，想试试能不能把石头扔到河对岸。</p>
<p>8．他后退几步，用尽全身力气扔出石头。就在石头脱手的那一刹那，圆木翻了，威利掉进了水里。</p>
<p>9．他很害怕，因为他不会游泳。尽管他使劲高呼救命，但根本没有人听见。</p>

<p>yelp loudly against looking barking</p>
<p>sprang clothes opened distress scratched</p>
<p>1．Poor little Bounce gave a great yelp of distress. If he had been a
big water dog, he could have jumped in and brought his master out.</p>
<p>2．He ran up and down the bank two or three times, barking, looking
first at Willie and then around. Then he started, as fast as he could
run, up the street to the store.</p>
<p>3．When he got there the door was shut, but he scratched against it
and barked loudly, until some one came and opened it.</p>
<p>4．He caught hold of Mr. Brown’s clothes, then ran to the door, then
back again, catching at him, barking, and jumping.</p>
<p>5．A friend who was in the store said to Mr. Brown, “Something must
be wrong; I would put on my hat, and go with the dog.” Bounce, seeing
Mr. Brown take his hat, started for the river.</p>
<p>6．Then Mr. Brown thought of Willie. As he came to the river, he saw
Willie’s hat floating on the water, and his small arm thrown up.</p>
<p>7．He sprang in and caught him just as he was going down for the last
time, and quickly carried him to the bank. Willie soon got over his
fright, and no one seemed to be more delighted than Bounce.</p>

<p>1．可怜的小鲍恩斯发出一阵悲痛的叫声。如果它是一条会游泳的狗，它肯定马上跳进河里把主人救上来。</p>
<p>2．它在河岸边来回跑了两三趟，汪汪叫着。它看着主人，急得团团转。最后，它飞快地跑上大街，往商店跑去。</p>
<p>3．当它跑到商店的时候，店门已经关上了。它使劲抓门，并且大声叫，直到有人开门。</p>
<p>4．鲍恩斯抓住布朗先生的衣服往门口跑，它用力抓住他，又跳又叫。</p>
<p>5．布朗先生对商店里的一个朋友说：“一定出了什么事，我戴上帽子，跟着这条狗去看看。”鲍恩斯看到布朗先生带上帽子，就朝河边跑去了。</p>
<p>6.布朗先生想到了威利。当他跑到河边的时候，他看到威利的帽子漂在水面上，他的小胳膊在水里不停摇晃着。</p>
<p>7．正当威利要沉到水里的时候，布朗先生及时跳进水中，把威利抓了上来，带到了岸上。威利渐渐地从恐慌中缓过神来。看到这一切，没有比鲍恩斯更高兴的了。</p>

<p>THE NEW SCALES</p>

<p>1．“Herbert, will you please peel my orange?” said Lucy. Herbert was
reading his new book, but he put it down at once, and took the orange
from his little sister.</p>
<p>2．“Shall I make a pair of scales, Lucy, for you to use when you play
store?”</p>
<p>3.“Oh yes! but how can you do that!”</p>
<p>4．“I’ll show you. First, we must take the peel off in two little
cups, one just as large as the other. While I do this, see if you can
find me two nice sticks about ten inches long.”</p>
<p>5．Lucy ran out to the woodhouse to find the sticks.—“ Will these
do?”</p>
<p>6．“No, they are too hard. Find some pine sticks if you can.”</p>
<p>7．“Here are some.”</p>
<p>8．“These will do nicely. Now I must make a scalebeam and a post. Can
you find me a little block for a post, Lucy?”</p>
<p>9．“Will a ribbon block do, Herbert?”</p>
<p>10．“Yes, if it is not too thick.”</p>
<p>11．“Here is one an inch thick.”</p>
<p>12．“That will be just right. Now get the little gimlet.”</p>
<p>13．Herbert worked away until he had made the beam and the post. Then
he made a hole in the middle of the block, and put the post in. Next, he
put the beam into a little groove at the top of the post, so that it
would balance nicely.</p>
<p>14．“Now, Lucy, we must have a needle and some thread. We must put
four threads to each cup; then we will tie the threads to the ends of
the beam.</p>

tied up in the yard.</p>
<p>2．Up in the attic, three little children were playing together. The
eldest might have been six years old; the youngest, not more than
two.</p>
<p>3．Stump! stump! stump! Some one was coming up the stairs.</p>
<p>4．The door flew open suddenly, and there stood the great, shaggy
bear. He had got tired of waiting, and had found his way to the
stairs.</p>
<p>5．The children were badly frightened. Each one crept into a corner,
but the bear found them all out, and smelt their clothes, but did not
hurt them.</p>
<p>6．“This must be a great dog,” they said, and they began to pat
him.</p>
<p>7．Then the bear lay down on the floor, and the youngest boy climbed
on his back, hid his head in the shaggy fur, and played at “hide and
seek”.</p>
<p>8．The eldest boy took his drum and began to strike it, when the bear
rose on his hind legs and danced. At that the children gave a merry
shout.</p>
<p>9．The two younger boys took their wooden guns, and gave the bear
one. Away they all marched around the room, keeping step.</p>

<p>THE FISHHAWK</p>
<p>鱼 鹰</p>
<p>1．The fishhawk, or osprey, is not so large as the eagle; but he has,
like the eagle, a hooked bill and sharp claws.</p>
<p>2．His color is a dark brown, with black and white spots, and his
length is from twenty to twenty-two inches. His breast is mostly white.
His tail and wings are long.</p>
<p>3．The fishhawk is often found sitting upon a tree over a pond, or
lake, or river. He is also found by the seaside.</p>
<p>4．He watches the fish as they swim in the water beneath him; then he
darts down suddenly and catches one of them.</p>
<p>5．When he catches a fish in his sharp, rough claws, he carries it
off to eat, and, as he flies away with it for his dinner, an eagle
sometimes meets him.</p>
<p>6．The eagle flies at him fiercely with his sharp bill and claws, and
compels the hawk to drop the fish.</p>
<p>7．Then the eagle catches the fish as it falls, before it reaches the
ground, and carries it off.</p>
<p>8．The poor fishhawk, with a loud cry, timidly flies away. He must go
again to the water and catch another fish for his dinner.</p>

only mode of getting a living is by catching fish.</p>

<p>gay twig meant stopped different</p>
<p>puff edge matter autumn hundreds</p>
<p>lead grew rustled October trembling</p>
<p>1．Once or twice a little leaf was heard to cry and sigh, as leaves
often do when a gentle wind is blowing. And the twig said, “What is the
matter, little leaf ?”</p>
<p>2．“The wind,” said the leaf, “just told me that one day it would
pull me off, and throw me on the ground to die.”</p>
<p>3．The twig told it to the branch, and the branch told it to the
tree. When the tree heard it, it rustled all over, and sent word back to
the trembling leaf.</p>
<p>4．“Do not be afraid,” it said, “hold on tight, and you shall not go
off till you are ready.”</p>
<p>5．So the leaf stopped sighing, and went on singing and rustling. It
grew all the summer long till October. And when the bright days of
autumn came, the leaf saw all the leaves around growing very
beautiful.</p>
<p>6．Some were yellow, some were brown, and many were striped with
different colors. Then the leaf asked the tree what this meant.</p>
<p>7．The tree said, “All these leaves are getting ready to fly away,
and they have put on these colors because of their joy.”</p>
<p>8．Then the little leaf began to want to go, and grew very beautiful
in thinking of it. When it was gay in colors, it saw that the branches
of the tree had no bright colors on them.</p>
<p>9．So the leaf said, “O branch! why are you lead-colored while we are
all beautiful and golden?”</p>
<p>10．“We must keep on our working clothes,” said the tree, “for our
work is not yet done; but your clothes are for holidays, because your
task is now over.”</p>
<p>11．Just then a little puff of wind came, and the leaf let go without
thinking, and the wind took it up and turned it over and over.</p>
<p>12．Then it fell gently down under the edge of the fence, among
hundreds of leaves, and has never waked to tell us what it dreamed

<p>3．小嫩枝把这件事情告诉了大树枝，大树枝又告诉了大树。大树知道后，它全身沙沙作响，传话给瑟瑟发抖的小叶子。</p>
<p>4．大树说：“别害怕，小叶子，抓紧，直到你准备好了你才会掉下去。”</p>
<p>5．小叶子不再叹息，它继续唱歌，继续沙沙作响。它活了一个夏天一直到10月。当明媚的秋日到来的时候，小叶子发现它周围的叶子都变得异常美丽。</p>
<p>6．有些变成了黄色，有些变成棕色，还有很多变得五彩斑斓。小叶子问大树这意味着什么。</p>
<p>7．大树说：“所有的这些叶子都准备飞走。因为他们快乐，所以变成了这样的颜色。”</p>
<p>8．小叶子也想要飞走。想到这些的时候，它已变得非常美丽。当它的颜色变得艳丽时，它看到树枝上没有了明亮的色彩。</p>
<p>9．小叶子说：“哦，树枝，为什么当我们都变得美丽灿烂的时候，你却变得暗淡无光了呢？”</p>
<p>10．大树说：“我们必须穿上工作服，因为我们的工作还没有完成，但你的工作已经完成了，所以你换上了假日的衣裳。”</p>
<p>11．此时，一阵风吹来，小叶子毫不犹豫地飞走了，风把它吹得高高的，带着它在空中翩翩起舞。</p>

<p>MAMMA’s PRESENT</p>
<p>妈妈的礼物</p>
<p>wore green joke Jessie presents</p>
<p>jolly deal trim expect leggings</p>
<p>1．Jessie played a good joke on her mamma. This is the way she did
it.</p>
<p>2．Jessie had gone to the woods with Jamie and Joe to get green
branches to trim up the house for Christmas. She wore her little cap,
her white furs, and her red leggings.</p>
<p>3．She was a merry little girl, indeed; but she felt sad this morning
because her mother had said, “The children will all have Christmas
presents, but I don’t expect any for myself. We are too poor this
year.”</p>
<p>4．When Jessie told her brothers this, they all talked about it a
great deal. “Such a good, kind mamma, and no Christmas present! It’s too
bad.”</p>
<p>5．“I don’t like it,” said little Jessie, with a tear in her eye.</p>
<p>6．“Oh, she has you,” said Joe.</p>
<p>7．“But I am not something new,” said Jessie.</p>
<p>8．“Well, you will be new, Jessie,” said Joe, “when you get back. She
has not seen you for an hour.”</p>
<p>9．Jessie jumped and laughed. “Then put me in the basket, and carry
me to mamma, and say, ‘I am her Christmas present.’”</p>
<p>10．So they set her in the basket, and put green branches all around
her. It was a jolly ride. They set her down on the doorstep, and went in
and said, “There’s a Christmas present out there for you, mamma.”</p>
<p>11．Mamma went and looked, and there, in a basket of green branches,
sat her own little laughing girl.</p>
<p>12．“Just the very thing I wanted most,” said mamma.</p>
<p>13．“Then, dear mamma,” said Jessie, bounding out of her leafy nest,
“I should think it would be Christmas for mammas all the time, for they
see their little girls every day.”</p>

<p>1．Ralph Wick was seven years old. In most things he was a fine boy,
but he was too apt to cry.</p>
<p>2．When he could not have what he wanted, he would cry for it and
say, “I will have it.”</p>
<p>3．If he was told that it would hurt him, and he could not have it,
he would begin to tease and cry.</p>
<p>4．One day, he went with his mother into the fields. The sun shone.
The grass was cut. The flowers were in bloom.</p>
<p>5．Ralph thought he was, for once, a good boy. A smile was on his
face. He wished to do as he was told.</p>
<p>6．He said, “Mother, I will be good now. I will do as you bid me.
Please let me toss this hay.”</p>
<p>7．“That I will,” said his mother. So they threw the hay, as Ralph
wished, and he was very happy.</p>
<p>8．“Now you must be tired,” said his mother. “Sit down here, and I
will get a nice red rose for you.”</p>
<p>9．“I would like to have one,” said Ralph. So his mother brought the
red rose to him.</p>
<p>10．“Thank you, mother,” he said. “But you have a white one, also.
Please give me that.”</p>
<p>11．“No, my dear,” said his mother. “ See how many thorns it has on
its stem. You must not touch it. If you should try to pluck a rose like
this, you would be sure to hurt your hand.”</p>
<p>12．When Ralph found that he could not have the white rose, he began
to scream, and snatched it. But he was soon very sorry. The thorns tore
his hand. It was so sore he could not use it for some time.</p>
<p>13．Ralph did not soon forget this. When he wanted what he should not
have, his mother would point to his sore hand. He at last learned to do

<p>THE FOX AND THE DUCKS</p>
<p>狐狸和鸭子</p>
<p>heed sight slyly stream drifting</p>
<p>flock flight snaps hidden circling</p>
<p>1．On a summer day, a man sitting on the bank of a river, in the
shade of some bushes, watched a flock of ducks on the stream.</p>
<p>2．Soon a branch with leaves came drifting among them, and they all
took wing. After circling in the air for a little time, they settled
down again on their feeding ground.</p>
<p>3．Soon another branch came drifting down among them, and again they
took flight from the river; but when they found the branch had drifted
by and done them no harm, they flew down to the water as before.</p>
<p>4．After four or five branches had drifted by in this way, the ducks
gave little heed to them. At length, they hardly tried to fly out of
their way, even when the branches nearly touched them.</p>
<p>5．The man who had been watching all this, now began to wonder who
had set these branches adrift. He looked up the stream, and spied a fox
slyly watching the ducks. “What will he do next?” thought the man.</p>
<p>6．When the fox saw that the ducks were no longer afraid of the
branches, he took a much larger branch than any he had yet used, and
stretched himself upon it so as to be almost hidden. Then he set it
afloat as he had the others.</p>
<p>7．Right among the flock drifted the sly old fox, and, making quick
snaps to right and left, he seized two fine young ducks, and floated off
with them.</p>
<p>8．The rest of the flock flew away in fright, and did not come back
for a long time.</p>
<p>9．The fox must have had a fine dinner to pay him for his cunning,
patient work.</p>

<p>1．“What are you going to do with him, Harry?”</p>
<p>2．“Let him go. He doesn’t like this cage half so well as his old oak
tree. A young owl can be tamed easily, but this one is too old to
tame.”</p>
<p>3．“But won’t he catch all your ducklings and little chickens?”</p>
<p>4．“No, not while there are any rats or mice around. Father says an
owl is a good mouser, and can catch more mice than half a dozen
cats.”</p>
<p>5．“I’m glad I had a look at him before you let him go. What soft
feathers he has!”</p>
<p>6．“Yes, he can fly so softly that you can scarcely hear him, and for
this reason he can easily surprise and capture his prey.”</p>
<p>7．“How comical he looks, winking his big eyes slowly, and turning
his head from side to side!”</p>
<p>8．“Yes, he is watching your dog. Be still. Bounce!”</p>
<p>9．“We have just found out a funny thing about his way of eating. He
breaks the bones of a mouse, and then swallows it whole. After an hour
or two, he throws up the bones and fur rolled up in a little ball.”</p>

<p>1．“哈里，你打算把它怎么办呢？”</p>
<p>2．“放了它吧。它对这个笼子的感情连对老橡树的一半也没有。一只幼小的猫头鹰很容易被驯化，但这只已经长大了，无法再驯化了。”</p>
<p>3．“但它不会去抓你的那些小鸭和小鸡吗？”</p>
<p>4．“不会的，当周围有田鼠或老鼠的时候它是不会抓的。爸爸说猫头鹰是捕鼠能手，一只猫头鹰比五六只猫抓的老鼠还多。”</p>
<p>5．“我非常高兴能在你放走它之前看到它，它的羽毛多柔软啊！”</p>
<p>6．“是啊，它飞起来很轻，几乎没有声音。这样它就能轻易地突袭并抓到它的猎物了。”</p>
<p>7．“它看起来好滑稽呀，慢悠悠地眨着大眼睛，头还左右摇晃。”</p>
<p>8．“是啊，它正在盯着你的狗看呢！呆着别动，鲍恩斯！”</p>
<p>9．“我们刚发现了它吃东西的方式特别有趣。它先咬断老鼠的骨头，然后把它全部吞下去。过一两个小时后，再把骨头和鼠毛攒成一个小球吐出来。”</p>

<p>GRANDFATHER’s STORY</p>
<p>爷爷的故事</p>
<p>1．“Come and sit by my knee, Jane, and grandfather will tell you a
strange story.”</p>
<p>2．“One bright summer day, I was in a garden in a city, with a
friend.” We rested underneath a fig tree. The broad leaves were green
and fresh.</p>
<p>3．“We looked up at the ripe, purple figs. And what do you think came
down through the branches of the fig tree over our heads?”</p>
<p>4．“Oh, a bird, grandfather, a bird!” said little Jane, clapping her
hands.</p>
<p>5．“No, not a bird. It was a fish; a trout, my little girl.”</p>
<p>6．“Not a fish, grandfather! A trout come through the branches of a
tree in the city? I am sure you must be in fun.”</p>
<p>7．“No, Jane, I tell you the truth. My friend and I were very much
surprised to see a fish falling from a fig tree.”</p>
<p>8．“But we ran from under the tree, and saw a fishhawk flying, and an
eagle after him.”</p>
<p>9．“The hawk had caught the fish, and was carrying it home to his
nest, when the eagle saw it and wanted it.”</p>
<p>10．“They fought for it. The fish was dropped, and they both lost it.
So much for fighting!”</p>

<p>1．“简，过来坐到我的膝边。爷爷给你讲一个神奇的故事。”</p>
<p>2．“一个阳光明媚的夏日，一个城市的花园里，我和一位朋友在一棵无花果树下坐着休息。无花果树上长着嫩绿宽大的叶子。”</p>
<p>3．“我们抬头看见了许多已经熟透的紫色无花果。如果那时有东西从无花果树的树枝上掉到我们头上，你觉得会是什么呢？”</p>
<p>4．“噢，一只鸟，爷爷，肯定是一只鸟。”简拍着手说。</p>
<p>5．“不，不是一只鸟。我的乖孩子，是一条鱼，一条红鲑鱼。”</p>
<p>6．“爷爷！肯定不是鱼，鲑鱼怎么能从城市里的一棵树的树枝上掉下来呢？我敢肯定您一定是在开玩笑。”</p>
<p>7．“不，简，我说的是实话。当朋友和我看到一条鱼从无花果树上掉下来时也感到非常惊讶。”</p>
<p>8．“不过当我们从树下跑出来时，看到了一只鱼鹗飞过，一只老鹰就跟在它后面。”</p>
<p>9．“那只鱼鹗抓住了一条鱼，想把它带回自己的巢里。这时被老鹰看到了，老鹰也想要这条鱼。”</p>
<p>10．“它们为了这条鱼打了起来。鱼掉了下来，它们谁也没有得到鱼。争鱼大战也由此停止了。”</p>

<p>A GOOD OLD MAN</p>
<p>善良的老人</p>
<p>hoe grave knock except</p>
<p>droll hymn prayed cottage</p>
<p>1．There once lived an old man in a snug, little cottage. It had two
rooms and only two windows. A small garden lay just behind it.</p>
<p>2．Old as the poor man was, he used to work in the fields. Often he
would come home very tired and weak, with his hoe or spade on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>3．And who do you think met him at the door? Mary and Jane, his two
little grandchildren.</p>
<p>4．They were too young to work, except to weed in the garden, or
bring water from the spring.</p>
<p>5．In winter, as they were too poor to buy much wood or coal, they
had little fire; so they used to sit close together to keep warm. Mary
would sit on one of the old man’s knees, and Jane on the other.</p>
<p>6．Sometimes their grandfather would tell them a droll story.
Sometimes he would teach them a hymn.</p>
<p>7．He would often talk to them of their father, who had gone to sea,
or of their good, kind mother, who was in her grave. Every night he
prayed God to bless them, and to bring back their father in safety.</p>
<p>8．The old man grew weaker every year; but the little girls were glad
to work for him, who had been so good to them.</p>
<p>9．One cold, windy night, they heard a knock at the door. The little
girls ran and opened it. Oh, joy to them! There stood their father.</p>
<p>10．He had been at sea a long time. He had saved some money, and had
now come home to stay.</p>
<p>11．After this the old man did not have to work. His son worked for
him, and his grandchildren took care of him. Many happy days they spent
together.</p>

<p>1．从前，有一位老人，他住在一个温暖的小农舍里。这个农舍只有两间屋子和两扇窗户。小农舍的后面有一个小花园。</p>
<p>2．这个贫穷的老人经常下地干农活。他肩头扛着锄头和铲子，回到家时，已经精疲力竭了。</p>
<p>3．你猜猜是谁在门口等候着他？是玛丽和简，老人的两个孙女。</p>
<p>4．她们年纪太小干不了太多的活，只能帮着在花园里拔草，或去泉边打点水。</p>
<p>5．冬天，她们因为太穷没钱买足够的木头和炭块，只能生起小小的火炉。他们常常紧紧地靠在一起取暖。玛丽坐在老人的一个膝盖上，简坐在另一个膝盖上。</p>
<p>6．有时，爷爷会给她们讲有趣的故事；有时，他会教她们唱圣歌。</p>
<p>7．爷爷时常讲起她们的爸爸，他是一位出海的水手；也会谈及她们善良而亲切的妈妈，她已经去世了。每个夜晚，他都会向上帝祈祷，祈祷上帝能保佑孩子，并保佑她们的爸爸能平安回来。</p>
<p>8．这位老人的身体一年不如一年。但两个小姑娘非常乐意帮慈爱的爷爷干活。</p>
<p>9．在一个寒冷的夜晚，风很大。她们听到一阵敲门声就跑过去开门。噢，她们高兴极了。站在外面的是她们的爸爸。</p>
<p>10．他出海很长一段时间了。现在他已经攒了一些钱，打算回家常住。</p>
<p>11．自此之后，老人不需要再干农活了，儿子接替了他，孙女们负责照料他。他们从此过上了幸福的生活。</p>

<p>THE GREEDY GIRL</p>
<p>贪吃的小女孩</p>
<p>dined gayly doctor glutton</p>
<p>needs lively acorns readers</p>
<p>tastes Laura greedy tempers</p>
<p>1．Laura English is a greedy little girl. Indeed, she is quite a
glutton. Do you know what a glutton is? A glutton is one who eats too
much, because the food tastes well.</p>
<p>2．Laura’s mother is always willing she should have as much to eat as
is good for her; but sometimes, when her mother is not watching, she
eats so much that it makes her sick.</p>
<p>3．I do not know why she is so silly. Her kitten never eats more than
it needs. It leaves the nice bones on the plate, and lies down to sleep
when it has eaten enough.</p>
<p>4．The bee is wiser than Laura. It flies all day among the flowers to
gather honey, and might eat the whole time if it pleased. But it eats
just enough, and carries all the rest to its hive.</p>
<p>5．The squirrel eats a few nuts or acorns, and frisks about as gayly
as if he had dined at the king’s table.</p>
<p>6．Did you ever see a squirrel with a nut in his paws? How bright and
lively he looks as he eats it!</p>
<p>7．If he lived in a house made of acorns, he would never need a
doctor. He would not eat an acorn too much.</p>
<p>8．I do not love little girls who eat too much. Do you, my little
readers?</p>
<p>9．I do not think they have such rosy cheeks, or such bright eyes, or
such sweet, happy tempers as those who eat less.</p>

<p>1．劳拉·英格丽是一个贪吃的小女孩。事实上，她算是个贪食者。你知道什么是贪食者吗？贪食者就是只要东西好吃，就吃的超量的人。</p>
<p>2．劳拉的妈妈一直希望她的饭量适度，保证健康。但有时，劳拉趁妈妈不注意就会暴食，以致最后都生病了。</p>
<p>3．我不知道她为什么那么傻。她的小猫吃饭时从不超量。吃饱后便离开盘子里美味的骨头，躺下睡觉。</p>
<p>4．蜜蜂也比劳拉聪明。它每天都飞来飞去，在花丛中采蜜。如果它愿意，它可以整天不停地吃。但它总会吃得刚刚饱，然后把剩下的带回蜂房。</p>
<p>5．松鼠吃坚果或橡子时，会像出席国王的宴席一样高兴得又蹦又跳。</p>
<p>6．你见过手里捧着坚果的松鼠吗？它吃坚果的样子是多么聪明可爱呀！</p>
<p>7．即使它住在橡子做的房子里，也不会生病，因为它不会吃下过多的橡子。</p>
<p>8．我不喜欢吃的超量的小女孩。我的小读者，你们喜欢吗？</p>

<p>1．George Ellet had a bright silver dollar for a New-year gift.</p>
<p>2．He thought of all the fine things he might buy with it.</p>
<p>3．The ground was all covered with snow; but the sun shone out
bright, and everything looked beautiful.</p>
<p>4．So George put on his hat, and ran into the street. As he went
skipping along, he met some boys throwing snowballs. George soon engaged
in the sport.</p>
<p>5．He sent a ball at James Mason, but it missed him, and broke a
window on the other side of the street.</p>
<p>6．George feared some one would come out of the house and find him.
So he ran off as fast as he could.</p>
<p>7．As soon as he got round the next corner, George stopped, because
he was very sorry for what he had done.</p>
<p>8．He said to himself, “I have no right to spend my silver dollar,
now. I ought to go back, and pay for the glass I broke with my
snowball.”</p>
<p>9．He went up and down the street, and felt very sad. He wished very
much to buy something nice. He also wished to pay for the broken
glass.</p>
<p>10．At last he said, “It was wrong to break the window, though I did
not mean to do it. I will go and pay for it, if it takes all my money. I
will try not to be sorry. I do not think the man will hurt me if I pay
for the mischief I have done.”</p>

am very sorry, and wish to pay you. Here is the dollar my father gave me

<p>3．The gentleman took the dollar, and asked George if he had no more
money. George said he had not. “Well,” said he, “this will do.”</p>
<p>4．So, after asking George his name, and where he lived, he called
him an honest boy, and shut the door.</p>

said he felt very well without any money to spend.</p>
<p>7．When dinner was over, Mr. Ellet told George to go and look in his
cap. He did so, and found two silver dollars there.</p>
<p>8．The man, whose window had been broken, had been there, and told

<p>1．Frank was a very talkative little boy. He never saw a new thing
without asking a great many questions about it.</p>
<p>2．His mother was very patient and kind. When it was proper to answer
his questions, she would do so.</p>
<p>3．Sometimes she would say, “You are not old enough to understand
that, my son. When you are ten years old, you may ask me about it, and I
will tell you.”</p>
<p>4．When his mother said this, he never teased any more. He knew she
always liked to answer him when he asked proper questions.</p>
<p>5．The first time Frank saw an hourglass, he was very much amused;
but he did not know what it was.</p>
<p>6．His mother said, “An hourglass is made in the shape of the figure
8．The sand is put in at one end, and runs through a small hole in the
middle. As much sand is put into the glass as will run through in an
hour.”</p>
<p>7．Frank watched the little stream of sand. He was impatient, because
it would not run faster. “Let me shake it, mother,” said he, “it is
lazy, and will never get through.”</p>
<p>8．“Oh yes, it will, my son,” said his mother, “The sand moves by
little and little, but it moves all the time.”</p>
<p>9．“When you look at the hands of the clock, you think they go very
slowly, and so they do; but they never stop.”</p>

very busily; and in one hour and a half he knew the hymn perfectly.</p>

<p>1．弗兰克是一个非常健谈的小男孩。每当看到一件新东西，他都会无一例外地提出一大堆问题。</p>
<p>2．他的妈妈非常善良，并且非常有耐心。只要弗兰克问的问题能够回答，她就会回答他。</p>
<p>3．有时她会说：“你还小，这些问题对于你来说还理解不了，我的儿子。当你满十岁的时候，你再问我，我会告诉你的。”</p>
<p>4．每当妈妈这样说的时候，弗兰克就会乖乖的不再问了。他知道只要他问合适的问题，妈妈总是很愿意回答。</p>
<p>5．弗兰克第一次看见沙漏的时候，他觉得非常有趣，但不知道这是做什么用的。</p>
<p>6．妈妈说：“沙漏是按照阿拉伯数字8的形状做成的，一端的沙子穿过中间的一个细洞流到另一端。沙子的总量刚好够它们流上一个小时。”</p>
<p>7．弗兰克注视着流下来的细沙。他很快失去了耐心，因为沙子流得太慢。“妈妈，让我摇摇吧。”他说，“沙子太懒了，根本不会流完的。”</p>
<p>8．“噢，是的，它流得慢，但最终会流完的，我的孩子。”妈妈说，“沙子虽然一点儿一点儿地流，但它们却一直在流动呀。”</p>
<p>9．“当你看钟表上的指针时，可能觉得它们走得非常慢。沙子也是一样，你觉得他们流得很慢，但它们从没有停过。”</p>
<p>10．“当你玩耍的时候，沙子在一粒一粒地流，钟表上的指针也在一秒一秒地走。”</p>
<p>11．“一个晚上，沙漏里的沙子会来回流动十二次，钟表上的时针也会在钟表盘上转整整一圈。”</p>
<p>12．“这是因为它们每分钟都在工作。它们从不停下来考虑它们要做多少工作，还需要多长时间来完成。”</p>
<p>13．现在，弗兰克的妈妈想要他学一首短圣歌，他却说：“妈妈，我永远都学不会这个。”</p>
<p>14．他的妈妈说：“那就一直学。永远不要停下来问这个要学多长时间。你很快就能学会的。”</p>
<p>15．弗兰克听取了妈妈的建议，他学了一行又一行，非常努力。一个半小时之后，他已经完全学会了这首圣歌。</p>

<p>1．“It’s of no use, Mrs. Templar; I have been trying the greater part
of an hour to catch that rogue of a horse. She won’t be caught.”</p>
<p>2．Such was the report the hired man brought in to Mrs. Templar one
pleasant May morning, when she had been planning a ride.</p>
<p>3．“I suppose it can not be helped, but I wanted her very much,” she
said, as she turned away.</p>
<p>4．“What was it you wanted, mother?” asked Jenny Templar, a bright,
brown-haired, brown-eyed girl of twelve, who had just come into the
room.</p>
<p>5．“Fanny,” said the mother. “It is such a beautiful morning, I meant
to drive down to the village, get some groceries, then call for your
Aunt Ann, have a nice ride up the river road, and bring her home to
dinner.”</p>
<p>6．“But father is away for all day, and the men have been trying
nearly an hour to catch Fanny; one of the men says she can’t be
caught.”</p>
<p>7．“Maybe she can’t by him,” said Jenny, with a merry laugh.“But, get
ready, mother; you shall go if you like. I’ll catch Fanny, and harness
her, too.”</p>
<p>8．“Why, my child, they say she jumped the ditch three or four times,
and acted like a wild creature. You’ll only be late at school, and tire
yourself for nothing.”</p>
<p>9．“It won’t take me long, mother. Fanny will come to me,” said
Jenny, cheerily. She put on her wide straw hat, and was off in a moment,
down the hill, to the field where the horse was grazing.</p>
<p>10．The moment Fanny heard the rustle of Jenny’s dress, she pricked
up her ears, snorted, and, with head erect, seemed ready to bound away
again.</p>
<p>11．“Fanny! O Fanny!” called Jenny, and the beautiful creature turned
her head. That gentle tone she well knew, and, glad to see her friend,
she came directly to the fence, and rubbed her head on the girl’s
shoulder. As soon as the gate was opened, she followed Jenny to the
barn.</p>
<p>12．The men had treated her roughly, and she remembered it. But she
knew and loved the voice that was always kind, and the hand that often
fed and caressed her. She gave love for love, and willing service for
kindness.</p>

<p>3．“我料到这样做无济于事，但我非常需要它。”她边转身边说道。</p>
<p>4．“妈妈，你需要什么？”刚刚走进屋子的珍妮·坦普勒问道。她今年十二岁，长着一头棕黑亮丽的头发和一双棕色的眼睛。</p>

<p>6．“但你爸爸一整天都不在家，那些人花了近一个小时试图捉住范尼。还无法捉住她。”</p>
<p>7．“也许她仅仅不能被那个人捉住。”珍妮快乐地笑着说，“不过妈妈，做好准备吧，如果你想去的话就能去。我会把范尼捉住，并且给它套上马具。”</p>
<p>8．“怎么可能，我的孩子？他们说它三四次都跳过水沟，就像只野兽一样。这会让你上学迟到，把你自己弄得精疲力尽却于事无补。”</p>

<p>POOR DAVY</p>
<p>可怜的大卫</p>
<p>rung Davy violet recess arrange</p>
<p>ferns maple dainty lingered prettiest</p>
<p>1．It was recess time at the village school. The bell had rung, and
the children had run out into the bright sunshine, wild with laughter
and fun.</p>
<p>2．All but poor Davy. He came out last and very slowly, but he did
not laugh. He was in trouble, and the bright, golden sunlight did not
make him glad.</p>
<p>3．He walked across the yard, and sat down on a stone behind the old
maple. A little bird on the highest branch sang just to make him
laugh.</p>
<p>4．But Davy did not notice it. He was thinking of the cruel words
that had been said about his ragged clothes. The tears stole out of his
eyes, and ran down his cheeks.</p>
<p>5．Poor Davy had no father, and his mother had to work hard to keep
him at school.</p>
<p>6．That night, he went home by the path that led across the fields
and through the woods. He still felt sad.</p>
<p>7．Davy did not wish to trouble his mother; so he lingered a while
among the trees, and at last threw himself on the green moss under
them.</p>
<p>8．Just then his teacher came along. She saw who it was, and stopped,
saying kindly, “What is the matter, Davy?”</p>
<p>9．He did not speak, but the tears began again to start.</p>
<p>10．“Won’t you tell me? Perhaps I can help you.”</p>
<p>11．Then he told her all his trouble. When he ended, she said,
cheerily, “I have a plan, Davy, that I think will help you.”</p>
<p>12．“Oh, what is it?” he said, sitting up with a look of hope, while
a tear fell upon a blue violet.</p>
<p>13．“Well, how would you like to be a little flower merchant?”</p>
<p>14．“And earn money?” said Davy. “That would be jolly. But where
shall I get my flowers?”</p>
<p>15．“Right in these woods, and in the fields,” said his teacher.
“Here are lovely blue violets, down by the brook are white ones, and
among the rocks are ferns and mosses. Bring them all to my house, and I
will help you arrange them.”</p>
<p>16．So, day after day, Davy hunted the woods for the prettiest
flowers, and the most dainty ferns and mosses. After his teacher had
helped to arrange them, he took them to the city that was near, and sold
them.</p>
<p>17．He soon earned money enough to buy new clothes. Now the sunshine
and the bird’s songs make him glad.</p>

<p>3．他穿过操场，坐在老枫树后面的石头上。一只小鸟在最高处的枝头上唱起了歌，只想让大卫笑起来。</p>
<p>4．大卫却没有注意到它。他正在想人们嘲笑他的破衣服时所说的那些刻薄的话。眼泪偷偷地从眼睛里流出来，顺着脸颊滴落下来。</p>
<p>5．可怜的大卫没有爸爸，他的妈妈不得不辛苦地工作，以供他上学。</p>
<p>6．那天晚上，他穿过田野和树林的小路回家，心里仍然很难过。</p>
<p>7．大卫不想让他的妈妈烦心，他在树林里逗留了一会儿，结果滑倒在树下绿色的青苔上。</p>
<p>8．就在这时，他的老师走了过来。她看到了大卫，于是停下脚步，和蔼地说道：“怎么了，大卫？”</p>
<p>9．他没有说话，眼泪却再次流了下来。</p>
<p>10．“你不想告诉我吗？或许我能帮助你呢。”</p>
<p>11．于是，大卫把所有的烦恼都告诉了老师。当他讲完后，老师说：“我有一个主意，大卫，我觉得这能帮助你。”</p>
<p>12．“哦？什么主意？”他说。他满怀希望地坐了起来，一滴眼泪落在一朵蓝色的紫罗兰上。</p>
<p>13．“好吧，你想不想做一个卖花的小商人？”</p>
<p>14．“卖花赚钱？”大卫说，“这是个好主意，但我从哪儿才能采到花呢？”</p>
<p>15．“就从树林和田野里采。”老师说，“这里有许多可爱的蓝色紫罗兰，小溪边有一些白色的，这些石头中还有些蕨类和苔藓。你把它们都带到我家，我会帮你整理好的。”</p>
<p>16．于是，大卫每天都到树林里寻找漂亮的花，以及苔藓和最美味的蕨类。等老师帮他整理好之后，他就把它们带到城里去卖。</p>
<p>17．很快，他就赚到了足够的钱买新衣服。现在，阳光和鸟儿的歌唱都会让他高兴起来。</p>

<p>2．Soon the tiny flakes floated softly down, like flocks of little
white birds. Faster and faster they came, till they filled the air. They
made no noise, but they were busy all night long.</p>
<p>3．They covered all the ground with a soft, white carpet. They hung
beautiful plumes on the tall, green firs. The little bushes, they put to
sleep in warm nightgowns and caps.</p>

new ones. They turned the old picket fence into a row of soldiers, and
the gate posts into captains, with tall white hats on.</p>

<p>1．One day, Bessie thought how nice it would be to have a garden with
only wild flowers in it. So into the house she ran to find her Aunt
Annie, and ask her leave to go over on the shady hillside, across the
brook, where the wild flowers grew thickest.</p>
<p>2．“ Yes, indeed, you may go,” said Aunt Annie, “but what will you
put the roots and earth in while you are making the garden?”</p>
<p>3．“Oh,” said Bessie, “I can take my apron.”</p>
<p>4．Her aunt laughed, and said, “A basket will be better, I think.”So
they looked in the closets and the attic, everywhere; but some of the
baskets were full, and some broken; not one could they find that would
do.</p>
<p>5．Then Aunt Annie turned out the spools and the bags from a nice
large workbasket, and gave that to Bessie. “You may have this for your
own,” she said, “to fill with earth, or flowers, or anything you
like.”</p>
<p>6．“Oh! thank you,” said Bessie, and she danced away through the
garden. She slipped through the gate, out into the field all starred
with dandelions, down in the hollow by the brook, then up on the
hillside out of sight among the shady trees.</p>
<p>7．How she worked that afternoon! She heaped up the dark, rich earth,
and smoothed it over with her hands. Then she dug up violets, and
spring-beauties, and other flowers,—running back and forth, singing all
the while.</p>
<p>8．The squirrels peeped out of their holes at Bessie. The birds sang
in the branches overhead. Thump, came something all at once into the
middle of the bed. Bessie jumped and upset the basket, and away it
rolled down the hill.</p>
<p>9．How Bessie laughed when she saw a big, brown toad winking his
bright eyes at her, as if he would say, “No offense, I hope.”</p>
<p>10．Just then Bessie heard a bell ringing loudly. She knew it was
calling her home; but how could she leave her basket? She must look for
that first.</p>
<p>11．“Waiting, waiting, waiting,” all at once sang a bird out of sight
among the branches, “waiting, Bessie.”</p>
<p>12．“Sure enough,” said Bessie, “perhaps I’m making dear mother or
auntie wait; and they are so good to me. I’d better let the basket wait.
Take care of it, birdie; and don’t jump on my flowers, Mr. Toad.”</p>

<p>2．“没有问题，你当然可以去。”安妮阿姨说，“但你在建造花园的时候用什么来装花草和土壤呢？”</p>
<p>3．“噢。”贝希说，“我可以拿着我的围裙。”</p>
<p>4．她的阿姨笑着说：“我觉得带个篮子会更好。”于是，她们到壁橱和阁楼里去找篮子。她们到处找，可那些篮子不是满的就是坏的，没有一个可用。</p>
<p>5．于是，安妮阿姨拿来一个漂亮的大针线盒，倒空了里面的线轴和布，交给了贝希。“这个给你吧。”她说，“你可以用它来装土装花，装任何你喜欢的东西。”</p>
<p>6．“噢，谢谢你。”贝希说。她蹦蹦跳跳穿过花园，跑出大门。她跑进长满蒲公英的田野，穿过溪边山洞，登上了绿树成荫的山坡。</p>
<p>7．看看她一下午都做了什么！她把肥沃的黑土堆成一堆，然后用双手平整好。接着，她挖出紫罗兰、春美人及其他花。她跑前跑后，忙来忙去，嘴里一直哼着歌。</p>
<p>8．松鼠们从它们的洞里探出头来瞧着贝希，鸟儿在头顶的树枝上唱着歌。砰的一声，一个东西一下子蹦到道路中央。贝希吓得跳了起来，篮子也翻了，滚到了山下。</p>
<p>9．可贝希笑得合不拢嘴，她看到一只棕色的大蛤蟆眨着一双明亮的大眼睛望着她，好像在说：“希望我没有给你添乱。”</p>
<p>10．就在这时，贝希听到了一阵响亮的铃声。她知道那是叫她回家的铃声，但她怎么能把篮子丢掉呢？她必须先把篮子找回来。</p>
<p>11．“等等，等等，等等。”藏在树枝后的一只小鸟叫道，“等等再捡吧，贝希。”</p>

<p>1．She was back at the house in a few minutes, calling, “Mother!
mother! auntie! Who wants me?”</p>
<p>2．“I, dear,” said her mother. “I am going away for a long visit, and
if you had not come at once, I could not have said good-by to my little
girl.”</p>
<p>3．Then Bessie’s mother kissed her, and told her to obey her kind
aunt while she was gone.</p>
<p>4．The next morning, Bessie waked to find it raining hard. She went
into her aunt’s room with a very sad face. “O auntie! this old
rain!”</p>
<p>5．“This new, fresh, beautiful rain, Bessie! How it will make our
flowers grow, and what a good time we can have together in the
house!”</p>
<p>6．“I know it, auntie; but you will think me so careless!”</p>
<p>7．“To let it rain?”</p>
<p>8．“No; don’t laugh, Aunt Annie; to leave your nice basket out of
doors all night; and now it will be soaked and ruined in
this—this—beautiful rain.” Bessie did not look as if the beautiful rain
made her very happy.</p>
<p>9．“You must be more careful, dear, another time,” said her aunt,
gently. “But come, tell me all about it.”</p>
<p>10．So Bessie crept very close to her auntie’s side, and told her of
her happy time the day before; of the squirrel, and the toad, and how
the basket rolled away down the hill; and then how the bell rang, and
she could not stop to find the basket.</p>
<p>11．“And you did quite right,” said her aunt. “If you had stopped,
your mother must have waited a whole day, or else gone without seeing
you. When I write, I will tell her how obedient you were, and that will
please her more than anything else I can say.”</p>

<p>5．“贝希！这是一场清新美丽的雨，它会让我们的花朵长大。并且我们可以一起在房子里度过一段美好的时光啊！”</p>
<p>6．“我知道，阿姨。但你会怪我很不小心！”</p>
<p>7．“你是说下雨这件事？”</p>
<p>8．“不是，别笑了，安妮阿姨。昨天我把你漂亮的篮子丢在门外一整夜，现在它该被这场美丽的雨淋湿了。”这场美丽的雨看起来并没有让她开心。</p>
<p>9．“亲爱的，下次你必须更加小心一些。”她的阿姨温柔地说，“来，告诉我昨天都发生了什么。”</p>
<p>10．于是，贝希慢慢地来到阿姨身边，告诉了她昨天自己有多么高兴。她说到了松鼠，说到了蛤蟆，也说到了篮子是怎么滚下了山坡，接着铃声怎么响了，以致她没能停下来去找篮子。</p>
<p>11．“你做得很对。”她的阿姨说，“如果你停下来找篮子，你妈妈肯定会等一整天，或是没见到你就走了。我给她写信时，我会告诉她你多么听话，这会让她比听到任何事情都更高兴的。”</p>

<p>THE SHEPHERD BOY</p>
<p>牧童</p>
<p>either trickle fancied murmur reflected</p>
<p>glossy entered shepherd chestnuts command</p>
<p>1．Little Roy led his sheep down to pasture,</p>
<p>And his cows, by the side of the brook;</p>
<p>But his cows never drank any water,</p>
<p>And his sheep never needed a crook.</p>
<p>2．For the pasture was gay as a garden,</p>
<p>And it glowed with a flowery red;</p>
<p>But the meadows had never a grass blade,</p>
<p>And the brooklet—it slept in its bed:</p>
<p>3．And it lay without sparkle or murmur,</p>
<p>Nor reflected the blue of the skies;</p>
<p>But the music was made by the shepherd,</p>
<p>And the sparkle was all in his eyes.</p>
<p>4．Oh, he sang like a bird in the summer!</p>
<p>And, if sometimes you fancied a bleat,</p>
<p>That, too, was the voice of the shepherd,</p>
<p>And not of the lambs at his feet.</p>
<p>5．And the glossy brown cows were so gentle</p>
<p>That they moved at the touch of his hand</p>
<p>O’er [1] the wonderful, rosy-red meadow,</p>
<p>And they stood at the word of command.</p>
<p>6．So he led all his sheep to the pasture,</p>
<p>And his cows, by the side of the brook;</p>
<p>Though it rained, yet the rain never pattered</p>
<p>O’er the beautiful way that they took.</p>
<p>7．And it wasn’t in Fairyland either,</p>
<p>But a house in the midst of the town,</p>
<p>Where Roy, as he looked from the window,</p>
<p>Saw the silvery drops trickle down.</p>
<p>8．For his pasture was only a table,</p>
<p>With its cover so flowery fair,</p>
<p>And his brooklet was just a green ribbon,</p>
<p>That his sister had lost from her hair.</p>
<p>9．And his cows were but glossy horse-chestnuts,</p>
<p>That had grown on his grandfather’s tree;</p>
<p>And his sheep only snowy-white pebbles,</p>
<p>He had brought from the shore of the sea.</p>
<p>10．And at length when the shepherd was weary,</p>
<p>And had taken his milk and his bread,</p>
<p>And his mother had kissed him and tucked him,</p>
<p>And had bid him “good night” in his bed;</p>
<p>11．Then there entered his big brother Walter,</p>
<p>While the shepherd was soundly asleep,</p>
<p>And he cut up the cows into baskets,</p>
<p>And to jackstones turned all of the sheep.</p>

<p>JOHNNY’S FIRST SNOWSTORM</p>
<p>乔尼初次见暴风雪</p>
<p>country groves losing sugar freezes</p>
<p>1．Johnny Reed was a little boy who never had seen a snowstorm till
he was six years old. Before this, he had lived in a warm country, where
the sun shines down on beautiful orange groves, and fields always sweet
with flowers.</p>
<p>2．But now he had come to visit his grandmother, who lived where the
snow falls in winter. Johnny was standing at the window when the snow
came down.</p>
<p>3．“O mamma!” he cried, joyfully, “do come quick, and see these
little white birds flying down from heaven.”</p>
<p>4．“They are not birds, Johnny,” said mamma, smiling.</p>
<p>5．“Then maybe the little angels are losing their feathers! Oh! do
tell me what it is; is it sugar? Let me taste it,” said Johnny. But when
he tasted it, he gave a little jump—it was so cold.</p>
<p>6．“That is only snow, Johnny,” said his mother.</p>
<p>7．“What is snow, mother?”</p>
<p>8．“The snowflakes, Johnny, are little drops of water that fall from
the clouds. But the air through which they pass is so cold it freezes
them, and they come down turned into snow.”</p>
<p>9．As she said this, she brought out an old black hat from the
closet. “See, Johnny! I have caught a snowflake on this hat. Look quick
through this glass, and you will see how beautiful it is.”</p>
<p>10．Johnny looked through the glass. There lay the pure, feathery
snowflake like a lovely little star.</p>
<p>11．“Twinkle, twinkle, little star!” he cried in delight. “Oh! please
show me more snowflakes, mother.”</p>
<p>12．So his mother caught several more, and they were all
beautiful.</p>
<p>13．The next day Johnny had a fine play in the snow, and when he came
in, he said, “I love snow; and I think snowballs are a great deal
prettier than oranges.”</p>

<p>1．乔尼·瑞德是一个小男孩，直到六岁才看见暴风雪。在这之前，他一直住在一个天气暖和的乡村。在那里，阳光洒满美丽的满是橘子的山坡，田野里到处是芳香扑鼻的鲜花。</p>
<p>2．但是，现在他来看望奶奶，奶奶住的地方冬天常常下雪。当雪花纷飞时，乔尼站在窗前定睛观望。</p>
<p>3．“噢，妈妈！”乔尼快乐地喊道，“快过来，白色的小鸟从天堂上飞下来了。”</p>
<p>4．“它们不是鸟，乔尼。”妈妈微笑着说。</p>
<p>5．“那么，它们就是小天使，正在掉羽毛！噢，快告诉我，是什么，是糖吗？让我尝一尝。”乔尼说道。但当他品尝雪花时，他不禁惊跳起来——太凉了。</p>
<p>6．“那只是雪而已，乔尼。”妈妈说道。</p>
<p>7．“雪是什么，妈妈？”</p>
<p>8．“乔尼，雪就是从云彩上掉下的小水滴。不过，水滴从天上掉下来时，被寒冷的空气冻住了，就变成了从天而降的雪花。”</p>
<p>9．妈妈一边说，一边从橱柜里拿出一顶黑色的旧帽子。“看，乔尼，我用帽子接住了一片雪花。快透过这块玻璃看一看，你就知道雪花有多么美了。”</p>
<p>10．乔尼透过玻璃看着雪花，那片纯洁轻柔的雪花就像一颗可爱的小星星。</p>
<p>11．“一闪一闪的小星星！”乔尼快乐地喊道。“噢，妈妈，再给我接些雪花吧！”</p>
<p>12．于是，妈妈又接住了一些雪花，都是那么漂亮！</p>
<p>13．第二天，乔尼在雪地里玩得非常开心，进屋后，他说：“我太喜欢雪了，雪球可比橘子好玩多了。”</p>

<p>Rose: Why, father, what a question! I should be sorry, indeed, if I

<p>Father: Are you sorry, my daughter, when you see the flowers and

<p>Rose: Sorry? No, indeed. Just now, I wished very much to go out and
see them,—they look so pretty.</p>
<p>Father: Well, are you sorry when you see the horses, cows, or sheep
drinking at the brook to quench their thirst?</p>
<p>Rose: Why, father, you must think I am a cruel girl, to wish that the
poor horses that work so hard, the beautiful cows that give so much nice
milk, and the pretty lambs should always be thirsty.</p>
<p>Father: Do you not think they would die, if they had no water to
drink?</p>
<p>Rose: Yes, sir, I am sure they would. How shocking to think of such a

<p>Father: I thought little Rose was sorry it rained. Do you think the
trees and flowers would grow, if they never had any water on them?</p>
<p>Rose: No, indeed, father, they would be dried up by the sun.</p>
<p>Then we should not have any pretty flowers to look at, and to make
wreaths of for mother.</p>
<p>Father : I thought you were sorry it rained. Rose, what is our bread
made of?</p>
<p>Rose : It is made of flour, and the flour is made from wheat, which
is ground in the mill.</p>
<p>Father : Yes, Rose, and it was rain that helped to make the wheat
grow, and it was water that turned the mill to grind the wheat. I
thought little Rose was sorry it rained.</p>

<p>建城堡</p>

<p>mimic nodded exclaimed already spilled</p>
<p>1．“O pussy!” cried Herbert, in a voice of anger and dismay, as the
blockhouse he was building fell in sudden ruin. The playful cat had
rubbed against his mimic castle, and tower and wall went rattling down
upon the floor.</p>
<p>2．Herbert took up one of the blocks and threw it fiercely at pussy.
Happily, it passed over her and did no harm. His hand was reaching for
another block, when his little sister Hetty sprang toward the cat, and
caught her up.</p>
<p>3．“No, no, no!” said she, “you shan’t hurt pussy! She didn’t mean to
do it!”</p>
<p>4．Herbert’s passion was over quickly, and, sitting down upon the
floor, he covered his face with his hands, and began to cry.</p>
<p>5．“What a baby!” said Joe, his elder brother, who was reading on the
sofa. “Crying over spilled milk does no good. Build it up again.”</p>
<p>6．“No, I won’t,” said Herbert, and he went on crying.</p>
<p>7．“What’s all the trouble here?” exclaimed papa, as he opened the
door and came in.</p>
<p>8．“Pussy just rubbed against Herbert’s castle, and it fell down,”
answered Hetty. “But she didn’t mean to do it; she didn’t know it would
fall, did she, papa?”</p>
<p>9．“Why, no! And is that all the trouble?”</p>
<p>10．“Herbert!” his papa called, and held out his hands. “Come.” The
little boy got up from the floor, and came slowly, his eyes full of
tears, and stood by his father.</p>
<p>11．“There is a better way than this, my boy,” said papa. “If you had
taken that way, your heart would have been light already. I should have
heard you singing over your blocks instead of crying. Shall I show you
that way?”</p>
<p>12．Herbert nodded his head, and papa sat down on the floor by the
pile of blocks, with his little son by his side, and began to lay the
foundation for a new castle.</p>

<p>1．“噢，可恶的猫！”赫伯特喊道，声音透露着愤怒与沮丧，因为他正在搭建的积木房子突然倒塌了。顽皮的猫撞了一下他的模型城堡，塔和围墙都嘎嘎地倒在了地板上。</p>
<p>2．赫伯特拿起一块积木狠劲地向猫扔去。幸运的是，积木从猫的身边飞过去，没有伤着它。他又去拿另一块积木，这时，小妹妹海蒂跑过来，抱起了小猫。</p>
<p>3．“不！不！不！”她喊道，“你不能伤害小猫！它不是故意的！”</p>
<p>4．赫伯特顿时怒火中烧，坐在地板上，双手捂着小脸哭了起来。</p>
<p>5．“真是个小孩子！”一直坐在沙发上看书的哥哥乔开腔了，“哭有什么用呢，再建一座新的就行了。”</p>
<p>6．“不，我才不呢！”赫伯特一边哭着，一边说。</p>
<p>7．“这里发生什么事了？”爸爸推开门走进来问道。</p>
<p>8．“猫咪刚才撞了赫伯特的城堡，城堡倒了。”海蒂回答道，“但猫咪不是故意的，它根本不知道城堡会倒掉，对吧，爸爸？”</p>
<p>9．“它当然不知道了！这就是你们的麻烦事？”</p>
<p>10．“赫伯特，过来！”爸爸一边喊，一边伸出手。小赫伯特从地板上站起来，慢慢走过去，眼里含着泪花，站在爸爸身边。</p>
<p>11．“我的孩子，还有一个更好的办法来解决这个问题。”爸爸说道，“如果你能照做的话，现在心里就好受多了。我倒希望听到的是你为你的积木歌唱，而不是为它哭泣。让我来教教你这种方式，好吗？”</p>
<p>12．赫伯特点了点头，爸爸坐到积木旁边，小儿子依偎在他身边，他们开始为一座新城堡垒地基。</p>

<p>CASTLE-BUILDING（CONCLUDED）</p>
<p>建城堡（结束篇）</p>
<p>string paper eagerly dashed ease</p>
<p>crash dishes retorted sentence tray</p>
<p>1．Soon, Herbert was as much interested in castle-building as he had
been a little while before. He began to sing over his work. All his
trouble was gone.</p>
<p>2．“This is a great deal better than crying, isn’t it?” said
papa.</p>
<p>3．“Crying for what?” asked Herbert, forgetting his grief of a few
minutes before.</p>
<p>4．“Because pussy knocked your castle over.”</p>
<p>5．“Oh!” A shadow flitted across his face, but was gone in a moment,
and he went on building as eagerly as ever.</p>
<p>6．“I told him not to cry over spilled milk,” said Joe, looking down
from his place on the sofa.</p>
<p>7．“I wonder if you didn’t cry when your kite string broke,” retorted
Herbert.</p>
<p>8．“Losing a kite is quite another thing,” answered Joe, a little
dashed. “The kite was gone forever; but your blocks were as good as
before, and you had only to build again.”</p>
<p>9．“I don’t see,” said papa, “that crying was of any more use in your
case than in Herbert’s. Sticks and paper are easily found, and you had
only to go to work and make another kite.” Joe looked down at his book,
and went on reading. By this time the castle was finished.</p>
<p>10．“It is ever so much nicer than the one pussy knocked down,” said
Hetty. And so thought Herbert, as he looked at it proudly from all
sides.</p>
<p>11．“If pussy knocks that down, I’ll—”</p>
<p>12．“Build it up again,” said papa, finishing the sentence for his
little boy.</p>
<p>13．“But, papa, pussy must not knock my castles down. I can’t have
it,” spoke out Herbert, knitting his forehead.</p>
<p>14．“You must watch her, then. Little boys, as well as grown up
people, have to be often on their guard. If you go into the street, you
have to look out for the carriages, so as not to be run over, and you
have to keep out of people’s way.”</p>
<p>15．“In the house, if you go about heedlessly, you will be very apt
to run against some one. I have seen a careless child dash suddenly into
a room just as a servant was leaving it with a tray of dishes in her
hands. A crash followed.”</p>
<p>16．“It was I, wasn’t it?” said Hetty.</p>
<p>17．“Yes, I believe it was, and I hope it will never happen
again.”</p>
<p>18．Papa now left the room, saying, “I don’t want any more of this
crying over spilled milk, as Joe says. If your castles get knocked down,
build them up again.”</p>

<p>1．很快，赫伯特就像刚才一样对新建城堡产生了极大兴趣，并开始为自己的工作欢呼。他所有的麻烦都烟消云散了。</p>
<p>2．“这比哭泣好多了，对吧？”爸爸问道。</p>
<p>3．“为什么要哭呢？”赫伯特问道，他已经忘记了刚才的悲伤。</p>
<p>4．“因为小猫撞倒了你的城堡呀。”</p>
<p>5．“噢！”一丝阴影掠过他的面庞，但马上就消失了，他继续建造他的城堡。</p>
<p>6．“我告诉过他，过去了就过去了，哭是没有用的。”乔坐在沙发上，一边说着，一边向这边张望。</p>
<p>7．“我想知道，如果你的风筝断线了，你哭不哭呀？”赫伯特反问道。</p>
<p>8．“丢失风筝是另外一回事。”乔回答道，情绪有些激动。“断了线风筝就永远没了，但是你的积木还完好如初，你只要再搭建就是了。”</p>
<p>9．这时，爸爸说道：“依我看，无论你，还是赫伯特，在这种情况下，哭都是没用的！棍棒和纸很容易找到，你只要重新做一个风筝就是了。”乔低下头继续看书，不再出声了。这时，新的城堡建完了。</p>
<p>10．“这比刚才猫撞倒的那个好看多了。”海蒂说。赫伯特也这么认为，因为不管从什么方向看，他都感到很自豪。</p>
<p>11．“如果猫再撞倒城堡，我就……”</p>
<p>12．“再建一座。”爸爸赶忙插话说。</p>
<p>13．“但是，爸爸，小猫千万不要再撞倒它了，我可受不了。”赫伯特皱着眉头大喊道。</p>
<p>14．“那么，你就要好好看护它。无论小孩子，还是大人，都要时刻提高警惕。如果你在大街上行走，一定要留心马车，防止被它撞倒，同时你还要注意别挡住别人的路。”</p>
<p>15．“即使在家里，如果你走路不小心，也有可能撞上别人。我就亲眼看见一个粗心的孩子，猛然冲进屋里，正好撞上手里拿着一摞盘子要离开房间的仆人。盘子都掉在地上，碎了。”</p>

<p>THE TRUANT</p>
<p>逃学者</p>
<p>falsely attend truant conduct therefore</p>
<p>guilty haste regular struggled ignorant</p>
<p>1．James Brown was ten years old when his parents sent him to school.
It was not far from his home, and therefore they sent him by
himself.</p>
<p>2．But, instead of going to school, he was in the habit of playing
truant. He would go into the fields, or spend his time with idle
boys.</p>
<p>3．But this was not all. When he went home, he would falsely tell his
mother that he had been to school, and had said his lessons very
well.</p>
<p>4．One fine morning, his mother told James to make haste home from
school, for she wished, after he had come back, to take him to his
aunt’s.</p>
<p>5．But, instead of minding her, he went off to the water, where there
were some boats. There he met plenty of idle boys.</p>
<p>6．Some of these boys found that James had money, which his aunt had
given him; and he was led by them to hire a boat, and to go with them
upon the water.</p>
<p>7．Little did James think of the danger into which he was running.
Soon the wind began to blow, and none of them knew how to manage the
boat.</p>
<p>8．For some time, they struggled against the wind and the tide. At
last, they became so tired that they could row no longer.</p>
<p>9．A large wave upset the boat, and they were all thrown into the
water. Think of James Brown, the truant, at this time!</p>
<p>10．He was far from home, known by no one. His parents were ignorant
of his danger. He was struggling in the water, on the point of being
drowned.</p>
<p>11．Some men, however, saw the boys, and went out to them in a boat.
They reached them just in time to save them from a watery grave.</p>
<p>12．They were taken into a house, where their clothes were dried.
After a while, they were sent home to their parents.</p>
<p>13．James was very sorry for his conduct, and he was never known to
be guilty of the same thing again.</p>
<p>14．He became regular at school, learned to attend to his books, and,
above all, to obey his parents perfectly.</p>

<p>1．詹姆斯·布朗十岁那年，父母送他去学校读书。学校离家不远，所以父母让他自己去上学。</p>
<p>2．但是，他并没有按时去学校，反而养成了逃学的坏习惯。他要么去田野里玩，要么跟一些游手好闲的孩子在一起消磨时光。</p>
<p>3．不仅逃学，当他回家时，他还跟他妈妈撒谎，说自己去上学了，而且课程非常精彩。</p>
<p>4．一天早上，天气晴朗，妈妈告诉詹姆斯放学后赶紧回家，因为想带他一起去姨妈家。</p>
<p>5．然而，他没有将妈妈的叮嘱放在心上，而是独自去了海边，那里有一些船，他还遇到了几个无所事事的小男孩。</p>
<p>6．其中几个男孩发现詹姆斯身上有钱，这可是姨妈以前给的零花钱。詹姆斯被他们诱导着去租了一条小船，与大家一起驶向大海。</p>
<p>7．詹姆斯根本没有意识到他将面临的危险。不久，水面上刮起了大风，他们都不知道如何控制小船。</p>
<p>8．有那么一小会儿，他们挣扎着逆风而行。很快，他们都精疲力竭，再也划不动船桨了。</p>
<p>9．一个大浪打来，船翻了，他们都落入了水中。现在，可想而知，詹姆斯——这个逃学的家伙，是什么境遇！</p>
<p>10．他已经离家很远了，没有人认识他。他的父母根本不知道他正处在危险之中。他在水中挣扎，几乎要被淹死。</p>
<p>11．幸好一些大人看见了这些孩子，赶快乘船来救他们。大人们及时赶到，把他们从死亡的边缘救了回来。</p>
<p>12．他们被带进了一所房子，将湿衣服烘干。过了一会儿，他们被送回了各自的家中。</p>

<p>THE BEAVER</p>
<p>海狸</p>
<p>prefer trapper forward material disturbing</p>
<p>dumb chiefly gnawing America cautiously</p>
<p>height purpose tighter reminded frequently</p>
<p>obtain curious inhuman including constructed</p>
<p>1．The beaver is found chiefly in North America. It is about three
and a half feet long, including the flat, paddle-shaped tail, which is a
foot in length.</p>
<p>2．The long, shining hair on the back is chestnut-colored, while the
fine, soft fur that lies next the skin, is grayish brown.</p>
<p>3．Beavers build themselves most curious huts to live in, and quite
frequently a great number of these huts are placed close together, like
the buildings in a town.</p>
<p>4．They always build their huts on the banks of rivers or lakes, for
they swim much more easily than they walk, and prefer moving about in
the water.</p>
<p>5．When they build on the bank of a running stream, they make a dam
across the stream for the purpose of keeping the water at the height
they wish.</p>
<p>6．These dams are made chiefly of mud, and stones, and the branches
of trees. They are sometimes six or seven hundred feet in length, and
are so constructed that they look more like the work of man than of
little dumb beasts.</p>
<p>7．Their huts are made of the same material as the dams, and are
round in shape. The walls are very thick, and the roofs are finished off
with a thick layer of mud, sticks, and leaves.</p>
<p>8．They commence building their houses late in the summer, but do not
get them finished before the early frosts. The freezing makes them
tighter and stronger.</p>
<p>9．They obtain the wood for their dams and huts by gnawing through
the branches of trees, and even through the trunks of small ones, with
their sharp front teeth. They peel off the bark, and lay it up in store
for winter food.</p>
<p>10．The fur of the beaver is highly prized. The men who hunt these
animals are called trappers.</p>
<p>11．A gentleman once saw five young beavers playing. They would leap
on the trunk of a tree that lay near a beaver dam, and would push one
another off into the water.</p>
<p>12．He crept forward very cautiously, and was about to fire on the
little creatures; but their amusing tricks reminded him so much of some
little children he knew at home, that he thought it would be inhuman to
kill them. So he left them without even disturbing their play.</p>

<p>1．海狸主要生活在北美地区。海狸大约三英尺半长，其中如浆一样的平坦尾巴就约一英尺长。</p>
<p>2．海狸后背上长长的光亮毛发是栗子色的，而紧靠皮肤的精美细柔皮毛则是灰棕色的。</p>
<p>3．海狸为自己建造的居所大多数奇形怪状，并且常常是很多小屋相邻，就像城市里的大楼一样。</p>
<p>4．它们总是将住所建造在河堤或湖边，因为它们在水中游泳比陆地上行走更方便一些，所以它们更喜欢在水中活动。</p>
<p>5．当它们在潺潺的小溪边建造自己的巢穴时，往往会建造一个跨越小溪的大坝，目的是按照自己的意愿保持水流的高度。</p>
<p>6．这些大坝主要由泥土、石头和树枝构成。有时候，它们建造的水坝足有六七百英尺长，如此完美的建筑，看上去更像是人类的杰作，而不是出自这些默不作声的小动物们之手。</p>
<p>7．它们的小屋和大坝都是由同样的材料建造而成的。小屋形状是圆的，墙壁非常厚实，屋顶则由一层厚厚的泥土、树棍和树叶组成。</p>
<p>8．它们常常在夏末开始建造小屋，但在霜冻来临前不会完工，因为霜冻会使小屋更加结实牢固。</p>
<p>9．为了得到修建大坝和小屋的木头，海狸用尖尖的前牙噬咬大树的细枝，有时候甚至还会咬断小树的树干。它们剥掉树皮，作为冬天备用的食物。</p>
<p>10．海狸的皮毛非常珍贵。猎杀这类动物的人被称为狩猎者。</p>
<p>11．曾经有一位先生，亲眼目睹了五只小海狸在玩耍。它们在自己建造的水坝附近嬉戏，大家都想跳过一棵大树的树干，于是相互推搡着想让另外一个掉进水里。</p>
<p>12．那位先生很小心地匍匐前进，随时准备射杀这些小动物，但是它们那些有趣的游戏使他想起了家中的孩子们。他心中想道：射杀这些动物是不人道的。因此，他悄悄地离开了，甚至没有打搅小海狸们的嬉闹玩耍。</p>

<p>THE YOUNG TEACHER</p>
<p>小老师</p>

<p>chalk ruling drawing pictures confused</p>
<p>1．Charles Rose lived in the country with his father, who taught him
to read and to write.</p>
<p>2．Mr. Rose told his son that, when his morning lessons were over, he
might amuse himself for one hour as he pleased.</p>
<p>3．There was a river near by. On its bank stood the hut of a poor
fisherman, who lived by selling fish.</p>
<p>4．His careful wife kept her wheel going early and late. They both
worked very hard to keep themselves above want.</p>
<p>5．But they were greatly troubled lest their only son should never
learn to read and to write. They could not teach him themselves, and
they were too poor to send him to school.</p>
<p>6．Charles called at the hut of this fisherman one day, to inquire
about his dog, which was missing.</p>
<p>7．He found the little boy, whose name was Joe, sitting by the table,
on which he was making marks with a piece of chalk. Charles asked him
whether he was drawing pictures.</p>
<p>8．“No, I am trying to write,” said little Joe, “but I know only two
words. Those I saw upon a sign, and I am trying to write them.”</p>
<p>9．“If I could only learn to read and write,” said he, “I should be
the happiest boy in the world.”</p>
<p>10．“Then I will make you happy,” said Charles. “I am only a little
boy, but I can teach you that.”</p>
<p>11．“My father gives me an hour every day for myself. Now, if you
will try to learn, you shall soon know how to read and to write.”</p>
<p>12．Both Joe and his mother were ready to fall on their knees to
thank Charles. They told him it was what they wished above all
things.</p>
<p>13．So, on the next day when the hour came, Charles put his book in
his pocket, and went to teach Joe. Joe learned very fast, and Charles
soon began to teach him how to write.</p>
<p>14．Some time after, a gentleman called on Mr. Rose, and asked him if
he knew where Charles was. Mr. Rose said that he was taking a walk, he
supposed.</p>
<p>15．“I am afraid,” said the gentleman, “that he does not always amuse
himself thus. I often see him go to the house of the fisherman. I fear
he goes out in their boat.”</p>
<p>16．Mr. Rose was much troubled. He had told Charles that he must
never venture on the river, and he thought he could trust him.</p>
<p>17．The moment the gentleman left, Mr. Rose went in search of his
son. He went to the river, and walked up and down, in hope of seeing the
boat.</p>
<p>18．Not seeing it, he grew uneasy. He thought Charles must have gone
a long way off. Unwilling to leave without learning something of him, he
went to the hut.</p>
<p>19．He put his head in at the window, which was open. There a
pleasant sight met his eyes.</p>
<p>20．Charles was at the table, ruling a copybook. Joe was reading to
him, while his mother was spinning in the corner.</p>
<p>21．Charles was a little confused. He feared his father might not be
pleased; but he had no need to be uneasy, for his father was
delighted.</p>
<p>22．The next day, his father took him to town, and gave him books for
himself and Joe, with writing paper, pens, and ink.</p>
<p>23．Charles was the happiest boy in the world when he came home. He
ran to Joe, his hands filled with parcels, and his heart beating with
joy.</p>

<p>2．罗斯先生告诉他的儿子，每天上午学完课程后，他可以随意玩一个小时。</p>
<p>3．他们家附近有一条河。河岸上有一座小屋，小屋里住着一个可怜的穷渔夫，靠打鱼为生。</p>
<p>4．渔夫的妻子非常勤劳，每天总是从早忙到晚，一刻也不闲着。夫妻俩都努力地想让生活过得略微好些。</p>
<p>5．但他们的最大麻烦是自己唯一的儿子无法读书识字。他们既没有知识无法自己教孩子学习，又因为贫穷而没有能力送孩子去学校学习。</p>
<p>6．有一天，查尔斯来到这家人门前，问他们有没有看到过他那只走失的狗。</p>
<p>7．他发现渔夫的儿子——一个名叫乔的小男孩，正坐在桌子上用粉笔画东西。查尔斯问他是否在画画。</p>
<p>8．“没有画画，我在试着写字呢。”乔说，“但我只认识两个字，是从一个标牌上看到的，我正试着写下来呢。”</p>
<p>9．“如果我能学习阅读和写字，”他继续说，“那我就是世界上最幸福的孩子了。”</p>
<p>10．“那么，我来让你幸福吧，”查尔斯说，“虽然我只是一个小孩子，但我能教你读书写字。”</p>
<p>11．“我父亲每天给我一个小时的时间供我自由支配。如果你想学习，你很快就能学会如何阅读和写字了。”</p>
<p>12．乔和他的妈妈都快跪下来感谢查尔斯了。他们告诉他，这正是他们最大的心愿。</p>
<p>13．于是，第二天，到了查尔斯自由支配的时间时，他便将书放进口袋里，去给乔上课。乔学得很快，不久查尔斯就开始教他如何写字了。</p>
<p>14．查尔斯走了一会儿之后，一位先生来拜访罗斯先生，问他是否知道查尔斯去了哪里。罗斯先生说，他猜查尔斯可能出去散步了。</p>
<p>15．“我担心，”那位先生说，“他并不总是自己出去玩。我经常看到他去渔夫住的小屋，我担心他坐船出去玩了。”</p>
<p>16．罗斯先生有点害怕了。他曾经叮嘱过查尔斯不要去河里玩，那样很危险，并且他认为应该相信孩子。</p>
<p>17．那位先生离开之后，罗斯先生出去寻找自己的儿子。他来到河边，来来回回地寻找，希望看到小船。</p>
<p>18．什么都没有看到，他开始不安起来。他以为查尔斯一定离岸边很远了。他不愿意一无所获地就此回家，于是便走向了渔夫住的小屋。</p>
<p>19．小屋有一扇敞开的窗户，他探头向里张望，令人愉悦的一幕映入眼帘。</p>
<p>20．查尔斯坐在桌子旁边，正在一本字帖上划线，乔在跟着他一起读，而乔的妈妈则坐在一个角落里织布。</p>
<p>21．看到父亲，查尔斯有点吃惊，他担心父亲可能会不高兴，但他没有必要不安，因为父亲看上去很快乐。</p>
<p>22．第二天，父亲带他去城里，给他和乔买了很多书，还有写字用的纸、笔和墨水。</p>

<p>1．Frank was one day walking with his mother, when they came to a
pretty garden. Frank looked in, and saw that it had clean gravel walks,
and beds of beautiful flowers all in bloom.</p>
<p>2．He called to his mother, and said, “Mother, come and look at this
pretty garden. I wish I might open the gate, and walk in.”</p>
<p>3．The gardener, being near, heard what Frank said, and kindly
invited him and his mother to come into the garden.</p>
<p>4．Frank’s mother thanked the man. Turning to her son, she
said,“Frank, if I take you to walk in this garden, you must take care
not to meddle with anything in it.”</p>
<p>5．Frank walked along the neat gravel paths, and looked at
everything, but touched nothing that he saw.</p>
<p>6．He did not tread on any of the borders, and was careful that his
clothes should not brush the tops of the flowers, lest he might break
them.</p>
<p>7．The gardener was much pleased with Frank, because he was so
careful not to do mischief. He showed him the seeds, and told him the
names of many of the flowers and plants.</p>
<p>8．While Frank was admiring the beauty of a flower, a boy came to the
gate, and finding it locked, he shook it hard. But it would not open.
Then he said, “Let me in; let me in; will you not let me in this
garden?”</p>
<p>9．“No, indeed,” said the gardener, “I will not let you in, I assure
you; for when I let you in yesterday, you meddled with my flowers, and
pulled some of my rare fruit. I do not choose to let a boy into my
garden who meddles with the plants.”</p>
<p>10．The boy looked ashamed, and when he found that the gardener would
not let him in, he went slowly away.</p>
<p>11．Frank saw and felt how much happier a boy may be by not meddling
with what does not belong to him.</p>
<p>12．He and his mother then continued their walk in the garden, and
enjoyed the day very much. Before they left, the gardener gave each of
them some pretty flowers.</p>

<p>狼来了</p>
<p>wolf grieved sleeve neighbors earnest</p>
<p>axes clubs order single destroy</p>
<p>1．A boy was once taking care of some sheep, not far from a forest.
Near by was a village, and he was told to call for help if there was any
danger.</p>
<p>2．One day, in order to have some fun, he cried out, with all his
might, “The wolf is coming! the wolf is coming!”</p>
<p>3．The men came running with clubs and axes to destroy the wolf. As
they saw nothing they went home again, and left John laughing in his
sleeve.</p>
<p>4．As he had had so much fun this time, John cried out again, the
next day, “The wolf ! the wolf !”</p>
<p>5．The men came again, but not so many as the first time. Again they
saw no trace of the wolf; so they shook their heads, and went back.</p>
<p>6．On the third day, the wolf came in earnest. John cried in
dismay,“Help! help! the wolf ! the wolf !” But not a single man came to
help him.</p>
<p>7．The wolf broke into the flock, and killed a great many sheep.
Among them was a beautiful lamb, which belonged to John.</p>
<p>8．Then he felt very sorry that he had deceived his friends and
neighbors, and grieved over the loss of his pet lamb.</p>
<p>The truth itself is not believed,</p>
<p>From one who often has deceived.</p>

<p>1．一个小男孩在离森林不远的地方放羊。他居住的村庄就在附近，人们告诉他，如果碰到任何危险，就大喊救命。</p>
<p>2．有一天，他为了取乐，使出吃奶的劲儿大喊道：“狼来了！狼来了！”</p>
<p>3．人们立刻拿着棍棒和斧头跑来，准备对付大灰狼，但赶来后，却发现没有狼，就都回去了，只留下小男孩约翰一个人捂袖偷笑！</p>
<p>4．因为这次行为让约翰感到了诸多乐趣，于是第二天他又喊道：“狼来了！狼来了！”</p>
<p>5．人们立刻又都跑来，但这次已经不如上次那么多人了。结果，他们发现自己又上当了，没有见到狼的任何踪影，只得摇摇头，各自回去了。</p>
<p>6．到了第三天，狼真的来了。约翰惊慌失措地喊道：“救命呀！救命呀！狼来了！狼来了！”但是，这一次没有一个人前来帮他了。</p>
<p>7．狼冲进羊群，咬死了很多羊，其中一只温顺漂亮的小羊羔还是约翰的。</p>
<p>8．终于，他为欺骗了朋友和邻居深感懊悔，也为失去了自己的宠物羊而感到痛苦。</p>

<p>THE LITTLE BIRD’S SONG</p>
<p>小鸟之歌</p>
<p>melody unnoticed modest content Gracie</p>
<p>1．A little bird, with feathers brown,</p>
<p>Sat singing on a tree;</p>
<p>The song was very soft and low,</p>
<p>But sweet as it could be.</p>
<p>2．The people who were passing by,</p>
<p>Looked up to see the bird</p>
<p>That made the sweetest melody</p>
<p>That ever they had heard.</p>
<p>3．But all the bright eyes looked in vain;</p>
<p>Birdie was very small,</p>
<p>And with his modest, dark-brown coat,</p>
<p>He made no show at all.</p>
<p>4．“Why, father,” little Gracie said,</p>
<p>“Where can the birdie be?</p>
<p>If I could sing a song like that,</p>
<p>I’d sit where folks could see.”</p>
<p>5．“I hope my little girl will learn</p>
<p>A lesson from the bird,</p>
<p>And try to do what good she can,</p>
<p>Not to be seen or heard.”</p>
<p>6．“This birdie is content to sit</p>
<p>Unnoticed on the way,</p>
<p>And sweetly sing his Maker’s praise</p>
<p>From dawn to close of day.”</p>
<p>7．“So live, my child, all through your life,</p>

<p>Though others may forget your looks,</p>
<p>They’ll not forget your song.”</p>

<p>HARRY AND ANNIE</p>
<p>哈里和安妮</p>
<p>least thaw sliding plunged naturedly</p>
<p>bade scatter pretend exploring disobedient</p>
<p>1．Harry and Annie lived a mile from town, but they went there to
school every day. It was a pleasant walk down the lane, and through the
meadow by the pond.</p>
<p>2．I hardly know whether they liked it better in summer or in winter.
They used to pretend that they were travelers exploring a new country,
and would scatter leaves on the road that they might find their way back
again.</p>
<p>3．When the ice was thick and firm, they went across the pond. But
their mother did not like to have them do this unless some one was with
them.</p>
<p>4．“Don’t go across the pond today, children,” she said, as she
kissed them and bade them good-by one morning; “it is beginning to
thaw.”</p>
<p>5．“All right, mother,” said Harry, not very good-naturedly, for he
was very fond of running and sliding on the ice. When they came to the
pond, the ice looked hard and safe.</p>
<p>6．“There,” said he to his sister, “I knew it hadn’t thawed any.
Mother is always afraid we shall be drowned. Come along, we will have a
good time sliding. The school bell will not ring for an hour at
least.”</p>
<p>7．“But you promised mother,” said Annie.</p>
<p>8．“No, I didn’t. I only said ‘All right,’ and it is all right.”</p>
<p>9．“I didn’t say anything; so I can do as I like,” said Annie.</p>
<p>10．So they stepped on the ice, and started to go across the pond.
They had not gone far before the ice gave way, and they fell into the
water.</p>
<p>11．A man who was at work near the shore, heard the screams of the
children, and plunged into the water to save them. Harry managed to get
to the shore without any help, but poor Annie was nearly drowned before
the man could reach her.</p>
<p>12．Harry went home almost frozen, and told his mother how
disobedient he had been. He remembered the lesson learned that day as
long as he lived.</p>

<p>1．哈里和安妮住在离城里一英里远的地方，但是他们每天都要去位于市区的学校上学。沿着小巷和牧场中的池塘边散步，是一件快乐的事情。</p>
<p>2．我不知道他们是喜欢夏天还是喜欢冬天。他们曾经假装自己是探索新国度的旅行者，将树叶洒在路上，以便再次找到归途。</p>
<p>3．当池塘里的水结成坚硬厚实的冰时，他们便从冰上穿过池塘。但是妈妈不想让他们这么做，除非有大人在旁随行。</p>
<p>4．一天早上，妈妈吻别他们后，说：“孩子们，今天不要从池塘的冰上走了，因为冰已经开始融化了。”</p>
<p>5．“好吧，妈妈。”哈里有点不耐烦地说，因为他非常喜欢在冰上滑行。当他们来到池塘时，冰看起来还是那么坚硬结实。</p>
<p>6．哈里对他的小妹妹说：“看，我就知道冰还没有化呢。妈妈总是担心我们被淹死。来吧，我们再好好地滑一次冰。学校的钟声还要一个小时才敲响呢。”</p>
<p>7．“但是，你已经答应妈妈了。”安妮说。</p>
<p>8．“不，我没有答应。我只是说‘好吧’，它也有‘没关系’的意思。”</p>
<p>9．“我什么也没说，所以我可以做任何自己喜欢的事情。”安妮说。</p>
<p>10．于是，他们踏上了冰面，开始滑行着穿越池塘。但还没走多远，冰面就开始塌陷了，他俩都掉进了水里。</p>
<p>11．在附近池塘边干活的一个男人听到了孩子们的尖叫声，一头扎进水里去救他们。哈里挣扎着自己游到了岸边，但可怜的安妮却差点儿被淹死，幸好那个男人抓住了她。</p>
<p>12．哈里到家时几乎被冻僵了，他告诉妈妈自己是多么的不听话。今天这个教训令他终生难忘。</p>

<p>BIRD FRIENDS</p>
<p>鸟类和人类是朋友</p>
<p>wife greet beard worms prayers</p>
<p>faith grove crusts church furnished</p>
<p>1．I once knew a man who was rich in his love for birds, and in their
love for him. He lived in the midst of a grove full of all kinds of
trees. He had no wife or children in his home.</p>
<p>2．He was an old man with gray beard, blue and kind eyes, and a voice
that the birds loved; and this was the way he made them his friends.</p>
<p>3．While he was at work with a rake on his nice walks in the grove,
the birds came close to him to pick up the worms in the fresh earth he
dug up. At first, they kept a rod or two from him, but they soon found
he was a kind man, and would not hurt them, but liked to have them near
him.</p>
<p>4．They knew this by his kind eyes and voice, which tell what is in
the heart. So, day by day their faith in his love grew in them.</p>
<p>5．They came close to the rake. They would hop on top of it, to be
first at the worm. They would turn up their eyes into his when he spoke
to them, as if they said, “He is a kind man; he loves us; we need not
fear him.”</p>
<p>6．All the birds of the grove were soon his fast friends. They were
on the watch for him, and would fly down from the green tree tops to
greet him with their chirp.</p>
<p>7．When he had no work on the walks to do with his rake or his hoe,
he took crusts of bread with him, and dropped the crumbs on the ground.
Down they would dart on his head and feet to catch them as they fell
from his hand.</p>
<p>8．He showed me how they loved him. He put a crust of bread in his
mouth, with one end of it out of his lips. Down they came like bees at a
flower, and flew off with it crumb by crumb.</p>
<p>9．When they thought he slept too long in the morning, they would fly
in and sit on the bedpost, and call him up with their chirp.</p>
<p>10．They went with him to church, and while he said his prayers and
sang his hymns in it, they sat in the trees, and sang their praises to
the same good God who cares for them as he does for us.</p>
<p>11．Thus the love and trust of birds were a joy to him all his life
long; and such love and trust no boy or girl can fail to win with the
same kind heart, voice, and eye that he had.</p>

<p>1．我曾经认识一个朋友，他特别喜欢鸟，鸟也特别喜欢他。他住在一片茂密的小树林里，家中既无妻子也无孩子。</p>
<p>2．他是一位和蔼善良的老人，长着灰白色的胡子，有一双蓝色的眼睛和所有小鸟都喜欢的声音。正是因为这个原因，他和小鸟成了朋友。</p>
<p>3．当他在美丽的林中小路上用耙子干活时，小鸟都会飞到他身边，从他刚刚挖出的新鲜泥土里找虫子吃。起初，小鸟跟他保持一定的距离，足有一两根竿子那么远，但它们很快就发现，这是一个友好和蔼的老人，不但不会伤害它们，而且喜欢它们靠近自己。</p>
<p>4．通过老人和蔼的眼神和温柔的声音，它们了解了他的心声。所以，一天天地，小鸟越来越相信老人对自己的爱是与日俱增的。</p>
<p>5．它们慢慢地靠近耙子，跳到耙子顶上争先恐后地抢虫子吃。当老人跟它们说话时，它们就转动小眼珠看他，好像在说：“这是一个善良的人，他喜欢我们，我们不必害怕。”</p>
<p>6．很快，小树林里所有的小鸟都成了老人的朋友。小鸟或在枝头上观看他，或从枝繁叶茂的树上飞下来，叽叽喳喳地和他打招呼。</p>
<p>7．当他不用耙子和锄头干活时，他就带着面包屑来到林间小路上，把面包屑撒向路面。当面包屑从他手中滑落的刹那，小鸟纷纷从天而降地扑向他，抢着吃食。</p>
<p>8．老人用行动向我表明了小鸟有多么喜欢他：他将一块面包的一端放进嘴里，让另一端露在外边。结果，小鸟像蜜蜂扑花一样飞向老人，将露在他嘴边的面包一片一片地啄走了。</p>
<p>9．清晨，当小鸟认为老人在睡懒觉时，会飞进屋里，站在床柱上，叽叽喳喳地叫醒他。</p>
<p>10．小鸟还会跟老人一起去教堂。当老人在教堂里念诵祈祷词、唱诵赞美诗时，小鸟就站在树上，向既爱我们也眷顾小鸟的慈祥的上帝唱诵赞美歌。</p>
<p>11．因此，对老人来说，小鸟对他的爱和信任是他终生的喜悦；并且，所有男孩或女孩，只要有他所拥有的善良的心、温柔的声音以及和蔼的眼神，都能够赢得这种爱和信任。</p>

<p>1．A merchant, who was very fond of music, was asked by a poor widow
to give her some assistance. Her husband, who was a musician, had died,
and left her very poor indeed.</p>
<p>2．The merchant saw that the widow and her daughter, who was with
her, were in great distress. He looked with pity into their pale faces,
and was convinced by their conduct that their sad story was true.</p>
<p>3．“How much do you want, my good woman?” said the merchant.</p>
<p>4．“Five dollars will save us,” said the poor widow, with some
hesitation.</p>
<p>5．The merchant sat down at his desk, took a piece of paper, wrote a
few lines on it, and gave it to the widow with the words,“Take it to the
bank you see on the other side of the street.”</p>
<p>6．The grateful widow and her daughter, without stopping to read the
note, hastened to the bank. The banker at once counted out fifty dollars
instead of five, and passed them to the widow.</p>
<p>7．She was amazed when she saw so much money. “Sir, there is a
mistake here,” she said. “You have given me fifty dollars, and I asked
for only five.”</p>
<p>8．The banker looked at the note once more, and said, “The check
calls for fifty dollars.”</p>
<p>9．“It is a mistake—indeed it is,” said the widow.</p>
<p>10．The banker then asked her to wait a few minutes, while he went to
see the merchant who gave her the note.</p>
<p>11．“Yes.” said the merchant, when he had heard the banker’s story,
“I did make a mistake. I wrote fifty instead of five hundred. Give the
poor widow five hundred dollars, for such honesty is poorly rewarded
with even that sum.”</p>

<p>2．He looked with sadness upon the little prisoners flying about the
cage, peeping through the wires, beating them with their wings, and
trying to get out.</p>
<p>3．He stood for some time looking at the birds. At last he said to
the boy, “How much do you ask for your birds?”</p>
<p>4．“Fifty cents apiece, sir,” said the boy. “I do not mean how much
apiece,” said the man, “but how much for all of them? I want to buy them
all.”</p>
<p>5．The boy began to count, and found they came to five dollars.”There
is your money,” said the man. The boy took it, well pleased with his
morning’s trade.</p>
<p>6．No sooner was the bargain settled than the man opened the cage
door, and let all the birds fly away.</p>

You have lost all your birds.”</p>

<p>HUMMING BIRDS</p>
<p>蜂鸟</p>
<p>West Indies adorn approach motion attached</p>
<p>sugar plum cotton instinct object defending</p>
<p>necessary rapid brilliant fibers severely</p>
<p>1．The most beautiful humming birds are found in the West Indies and
South America. The crest of the tiny head of one of these shines like a
sparkling crown of colored light.</p>
<p>2．The shades of color that adorn its breast, are equally brilliant.
As the bird flits from one object to another, it looks more like a
bright flash of sunlight than it does like a living being.</p>
<p>3．But, you ask, why are they called humming birds? It is because
they make a soft, humming noise by the rapid motion of their wings—a
motion so rapid, that as they fly you can only see that they have
wings.</p>
<p>4．One day when walking in the woods, I found the nest of one of the
smallest humming birds. It was about half the size of a very small hen’s
egg, and was attached to a twig no thicker than a steel knitting
needle.</p>
<p>5．It seemed to have been made of cotton fibers, and was covered with
the softest bits of leaf and bark. It had two eggs in it, quite white,
and each about as large as a small sugarplum.</p>
<p>6．When you approach the spot where one of these birds has built its
nest, it is necessary to be careful. The mother bird will dart at you
and try to peck your eyes. Its sharp beak may hurt your eyes most
severely, and even destroy the sight.</p>
<p>7．The poor little thing knows no other way of defending its young,
and instinct teaches it that you might carry off its nest if you could
find it.</p>

<p>1．世界上最美丽的蜂鸟仅仅在西印度群岛和南美洲发现过。其中一只小鸟很特别，它的小脑袋上有一个闪烁着耀眼光芒的顶冠，如同色彩斑斓的璀璨皇冠一样。</p>
<p>2．装饰它胸脯的色彩，也同样光彩夺目。当蜂鸟从一个地方飞到另一个地方，它看上去更像是一道亮闪闪的光，而不仅仅是一个小生命。</p>
<p>3．只是，你可能会问，它们为何被称为蜂鸟呢？那是因为它们在飞行时急速扇动翅膀而发出细微的嗡嗡声。蜂鸟颤动翅膀的速度极快，以至于当它们飞过时，人们只能看到空中翱翔而过的翅膀。</p>
<p>4．有一天，我在林中漫步时，发现了一只小蜂鸟的巢，它大概只有半个鸡蛋大，附着在一根细如钢针的小树枝上。</p>

<p>THE WIND AND THE SUN</p>
<p>风和太阳</p>
<p>decide buckled mountain shelter party</p>
<p>dispute succeed forcibly mantle oven</p>
<p>1．A dispute once arose between the Wind and the Sun, as to which was
the stronger.</p>
<p>2．To decide the matter, they agreed to try their power on a
traveler. That party which should first strip him of his cloak, was to
win the day.</p>
<p>3．The Wind began. He blew a cutting blast, which tore up the
mountain oaks by their roots, and made the whole forest look like a
wreck.</p>
<p>4．But the traveler, though at first he could scarcely keep his cloak
on his back, ran under a hill for shelter, and buckled his mantle about
him more closely.</p>
<p>5．The Wind having thus tried his utmost power in vain, the Sun
began.</p>
<p>6．Bursting through a thick cloud, he darted his sultry beams so
forcibly upon the traveler’s head, that the poor fellow was almost
melted.</p>
<p>7．“This,” said he, “is past all bearing. It is so hot, that one
might as well be in an oven.”</p>
<p>8．So he quickly threw off his cloak, and went into the shade of a
tree to cool himself.</p>
<p>9．This fable teaches us, that gentle means will often succeed where
forcible ones will fail.</p>

<p>1．有一次，风和太阳起了争执，双方都在强调自己更厉害。</p>
<p>2．为了解决这个问题，风和太阳都同意在一个旅行者身上施展威力。最先让他脱掉斗篷的一方，就是当天的胜利者。</p>
<p>3．风先开始发威。它发动了猛烈的攻击，甚至把山上的橡树都连根拔起，整个森林一片狼藉。</p>
<p>4．这个旅行者起先差点没能保住自己背上的斗篷，但他很快就跑到一个小山丘下躲藏，并且迅速紧紧地扣好了斗篷。</p>
<p>5．风几乎用尽了全部力气，依然徒劳无功，接下来轮到了太阳进攻。</p>
<p>6．太阳冲破了厚厚的云层喷薄而出，闷热的强光向旅行者直射过来，这个可怜的家伙都快被融化了。</p>
<p>7．他自言自语地说：“受不了了，实在太热了，就像在烤箱中一样备受煎熬。”</p>
<p>8．于是，他快速脱掉了自己的斗篷，走到一片树荫下乘凉。</p>

Daisy Marvin, as she walked home from school with her teacher.</p>
<p>2．“In my opinion, Daisy, Mary’s hands are the prettiest in the
class.”</p>
<p>3．“Why, Miss Roberts, they are as red and hard as they can be. How
they would look if she were to try to play on a piano!” exclaimed
Daisy.</p>
<p>4．Miss Roberts took Daisy’s hands in hers, and said, “Your hands are
very soft and white, Daisy—just the hands to look beautiful on a piano;
yet they lack one beauty that Mary’s hands have. Shall I tell you what
the difference is?”</p>
<p>5．“Yes, please, Miss Roberts.”</p>
<p>6．“Well, Daisy, Mary’s hands are always busy. They wash dishes; they
make fires; they hang out clothes, and help to wash them, too; they
sweep, and dust, and sew; they are always trying to help her poor,
hard-working mother.”</p>
<p>7．“Besides, they wash and dress the children; they mend their toys
and dress their dolls; yet, they find time to bathe the head of the
little girl who is so sick in the next house to theirs.”</p>

them patting the tired horse and the lame dog in the street. They are

Roberts.”</p>

they are beautiful because they do their work gladly and
cheerfully.”</p>

Daisy, looking into her teacher’s face with tearful eyes.</p>

alone are really beautiful.”</p>

<p>4．罗伯茨小姐捧起黛西的手，说：“黛西，你的手非常柔软白皙，正是那种弹钢琴的美丽小手，但是，它们却缺乏玛丽那双手所展示出的美丽。想知道你们哪里有不同吗？”</p>
<p>5．“好啊，罗伯茨小姐，请讲吧。”</p>
<p>6．“好吧，黛西，玛丽的手总是闲不住——既要洗碗盘、生炉火、洗衣服、晒衣服，又要打扫卫生、清扫灰尘、缝补衣服。她的手总想给努力工作的可怜母亲多些帮助。”</p>
<p>7．“还有，她的双手要给小孩子洗澡、穿衣服，还要修补玩具、给玩偶穿衣服等，但是，它们依然能够抽空给隔壁邻居家生病的小姑娘洗头发。”</p>

<p>And are just as cunning as cunning can be.</p>
<p>They look very wise, with their pretty red eyes,</p>
<p>That seem just exactly like little round beads;</p>
<p>They are white as the snow, and stand up in a row</p>
<p>Whenever we do not attend to their needs;—</p>
<p>2．Stand up in a row in a comical way,—</p>
<p>Now folding their forepaws as if saying, “please;”</p>
<p>Now rattling the lattice, as much as to say,</p>
<p>“We shall not stay here without more bread and cheese,”</p>
<p>They are not at all shy, as you’ll find, if you try</p>
<p>To make them run up in their chamber to bed;</p>
<p>If they don’t want to go, why, they won’t go—ah! no,</p>
<p>Though you tap with your finger each queer little head.</p>
<p>3．One day as I stood by the side of the cage,</p>
<p>Through the bars there protruded a funny, round tail;</p>
<p>Just for mischief I caught it, and soon, in a rage,</p>
<p>Its owner set up a most pitiful wail.</p>
<p>He looked in dismay,—there was something to pay,—</p>
<p>But what was the matter he could not make out;</p>
<p>What was holding him so, when he wanted to go</p>
<p>To see what his brothers upstairs were about?</p>
<p>4．But soon from the chamber the others rushed down,</p>
<p>Impatient to learn what the trouble might be;</p>
<p>I have not a doubt that each brow wore a frown,</p>
<p>Only frowns on their brows are not easy to see.</p>
<p>For a moment they gazed, perplexed and amazed;</p>
<p>Then began both together to—gnaw off the tail!</p>
<p>So, quick I released him,—do you think that it pleased him?</p>

into the street, to repeat them to those he might meet.</p>
<p>3．When he came back, his father gave him two bright, new silver
dollars.</p>
<p>4．His face lighted up as he took them. He had wished for a long time
to buy some pretty books that he had seen at the bookstore.</p>
<p>5．He left the house with a light heart, intending to buy the
books.</p>
<p>6．As he ran down the street, he saw a poor German family, the
father, mother, and three children shivering with cold.</p>
<p>7．“I wish you a happy New Year,” said Edward, as he was gayly
passing on. The man shook his head.</p>
<p>8．“You do not belong to this country,” said Edward. The man again
shook his head, for he could not understand or speak our language.</p>
<p>9．But he pointed to his mouth, and to the children, as if to
say,“These little ones have had nothing to eat for a long time.”</p>
<p>10．Edward quickly understood that these poor people were in
distress. He took out his dollars, and gave one to the man, and the
other to his wife.</p>
<p>11．How their eyes sparkled with gratitude! They said something in
their language, which doubtless meant, “We thank you a thousand times,
and will remember you in our prayers.”</p>
<p>12．When Edward came home, his father asked what books he had bought.
He hung his head a moment, but quickly looked up.</p>
<p>13．“I have bought no books,” said he, “I gave my money to some poor
people, who seemed to be very hungry and wretched.”</p>

had seen how glad they were to receive the money!”</p>

I give them to you, more as a reward for your goodness of heart than as

and winter the same, without asking his leave.”</p>
<p>3．“I tell the people the time to rise, to go to dinner, and to come

is for you. How silly you look! You can say nothing.”</p>
<p>5．The sun, at that moment, broke forth from behind a cloud, and
showed, by the sundial, that the clock was half an hour behind the right

<p>COURAGE AND COWARDICE</p>
<p>勇敢与怯懦</p>
<p>deal straight courage reproach cowardice</p>
<p>depth effort coward deserved schoolmates</p>
<p>1．Robert and Henry were going home from school, when, on turning a
corner, Robert cried out, “A fight! let us go and see!”</p>
<p>2．“No,” said Henry; “let us go quietly home and not meddle with this
quarrel. We have nothing to do with it, and may get into mischief.”</p>
<p>3．“You are a coward, and afraid to go,” said Robert, and off he ran.
Henry went straight home, and in the afternoon went to school, as
usual.</p>
<p>4．But Robert had told all the boys that Henry was a coward, and they
laughed at him a great deal.</p>
<p>5．Henry had learned, however, that true courage is shown most in
bearing reproach when not deserved, and that he ought to be afraid of
nothing but doing wrong.</p>
<p>6．A few days after, Robert was bathing with some schoolmates, and
got out of his depth. He struggled, and screamed for help, but all in
vain.</p>
<p>7．The boys who had called Henry a coward, got out of the water as
fast as they could, but they did not even try to help him.</p>
<p>8．Robert was fast sinking, when Henry threw off his clothes, and
sprang into the water. He reached Robert just as he was sinking the last
time.</p>
<p>9．By great effort, and with much danger to himself, he brought
Robert to the shore, and thus saved his life.</p>
<p>10．Robert and his schoolmates were ashamed at having called Henry a
coward. They owned that he had more courage than any of them.</p>
<p>11．Never be afraid to do good, but always fear to do evil.</p>

<p>WEIGHING AN ELEPHANT</p>
<p>称象</p>
<p>eastern deliverance weight favorite clever</p>
<p>sailor enormous court quantity subject</p>
<p>expense elephant stroked machine leaning</p>
<p>opening difficulty risen relieved empty</p>
<p>1．“An eastern king,” said Teddy’s mother, “had been saved from some
great danger. To show his gratitude for deliverance, he vowed he would
give to the poor the weight of his favorite elephant in silver.”</p>
<p>2．“Oh! what a great quantity that would be,” cried Lily, opening her
eyes very wide. “But how could you weigh an elephant?” asked Teddy, who
was a quiet, thoughtful boy.</p>
<p>3．“There was the difficulty,” said his mother. “The wise and learned
men of the court stroked their long beards, and talked the matter over,
but no one found out how to weigh the elephant.”</p>
<p>4．“At last, a poor old sailor found safe and simple means by which
to weigh the enormous beast. The thousands and thousands of pieces of
silver were counted out to the people; and crowds of the poor were
relieved by the clever thought of the sailor.”</p>
<p>5．“O mamma,” said Lily, “do tell us what it was!”</p>
<p>6．“Stop, stop!” said Teddy. “I want to think for myself—think
hard—and find out how an elephant’s weight could be known, with little
trouble and expense.”</p>
<p>7．“I am well pleased,” said his mother, “that my little boy should
set his mind to work on the subject. If he can find out the sailor’s
secret before night, he shall have that orange for his pains.”</p>
<p>8．The boy thought hard and long. Lily laughed at her brother’s grave
looks, as he sat leaning his head on his hands. Often she teased him
with the question, “Can you weigh an elephant, Teddy?”</p>
<p>9．At last, while eating his supper, Teddy suddenly cried out, “I
have it now!”</p>
<p>10．“Do you think so?” asked his mother.</p>
<p>11．“How would you do it,” asked Lily.</p>
<p>12．“First, I would have a big boat brought very close to the shore,
and would have planks laid across, so that the elephant could walk right
into it.”</p>
<p>13．“Oh, such a great, heavy beast would make it sink low in the
water,” said Lily.</p>
<p>14．“Of course it would,” said her brother. “Then I would mark on the
outside of the boat the exact height to which the water had risen all
around it while the elephant was inside. Then he should march on shore,
leaving the boat quite empty.”</p>
<p>15．“But I don’t see the use of all this,” said Lily.</p>
<p>16．“Don’t you?” cried Teddy, in surprise. “Why, I should then bring
the heaps of silver, and throw them into the boat till their weight
would sink it to the mark made by the elephant. That would show that the
weight of each was the same.”</p>
<p>17．“How funny!” cried Lily; “you would make a weighing machine of
the boat?”</p>
<p>18．“That is my plan,” said Teddy.</p>
<p>19．“That was the sailor’s plan,” said his mother. “You have earned
the orange, my boy;” and she gave it to him with a smile.</p>

<p>1．泰迪的妈妈说：“遥远的东方曾有一个国王临危获救。为了表达自己的感激之情，他承诺要向穷人分发银子，发放的银两和他最喜欢的大象一样重。”</p>
<p>2．“哎呀，那可是一笔不小的数目啊，”莉丽瞪大双眼，大声喊道。泰迪百思不得其解，便问道：“但是，如何才能称出大象的重量呀？”他一直是个安静而又喜欢思考的孩子。</p>
<p>3．妈妈接着说：“这就是难题所在，朝廷上那些智者和有学问的人都捋着长胡子，纷纷议论如何称象，可是，最终也没有人想出具体的衡量办法。”</p>
<p>4．“最后，一个贫穷的老水手想出了一个既安全又简单的方法来称量这头巨兽的重量。称出来的成千上万两白银分发给了穷人，这个水手用他的聪明智慧救济了一大批穷人。”</p>
<p>5．莉丽说：“噢，妈妈，快告诉我们到底是用了什么方法！”</p>
<p>6．可泰迪却说：“不要说，不要说！我要自己想，仔细地想一想，我要自己想出称象的方法，哪怕有点儿麻烦。”</p>
<p>7．他的妈妈说：“我非常高兴我的小儿子可以自己动脑筋想办法解决问题。如果他能在今晚揭开水手称象的秘密，就可以得到那个橘子作奖励。”</p>
<p>8．这个男孩子认真地想了很久。他双手托腮坐在那里思考时，莉丽却在嘲笑弟弟一本正经的认真模样。她时不时过去取笑他：“泰迪，你真的能称出一头大象的重量吗？”</p>
<p>9．后来，就在吃晚饭时，泰迪突然大喊道：“我终于知道了！”</p>
<p>10．“真的吗？”妈妈问他。</p>
<p>11．莉丽也问道：“你想怎么称象啊？”</p>
<p>12．“首先，我需要一艘大船，把船尽量靠近岸边，在船和岸边中间搭上厚木板，这样，大象就能直接走到船上了。”</p>
<p>13．“哇，这么体态肥硕的巨兽一定会让船往下沉的。”莉丽说道。</p>
<p>14．“船当然会往下沉了，”她的弟弟说，“接着，我就会在船舷一侧标出大象站在船上时水面上升的准确高度。然后，让它走上岸，船就空了。”</p>
<p>15．“我认为这样做没有什么用。”莉丽说。</p>
<p>16．泰迪吃惊地大喊：“怎么会没有用呢？哎呀，我接下来会把大批银两装到船上，直到它们的重量使船下沉到那个称大象时的刻度，这样就能表明它们的重量相等了。”</p>
<p>17．“多么有趣的主意呀！你会做出一个和船一样的称重机吗？”</p>
<p>18．“这还真是我的计划。”泰迪说。</p>
<p>19．“这也正是那个老水手的办法，”他的妈妈说，“我的儿子，你赢得了橘子。”她微笑着把橘子递给了泰迪。</p>

<p>THE ECHO</p>
<p>回声</p>
<p>thicket harshly wrath whence rambling</p>
<p>proving toward echo mocking angrily</p>
<p>foolish abroad cross Bible instantly</p>
<p>1．As Robert was one day rambling about, he happened to cry out, “Ho,
ho!” He instantly heard coming back from a hill near by, the same words,
“Ho, ho!”</p>
<p>2．In great surprise, he said with a loud voice, “Who are you?” Upon
this, the same words came back, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>3．Robert now cried out harshly, “You must be a very foolish fellow.”
“Foolish fellow!” came back from the hill.</p>
<p>4．Robert became angry, and with loud and fierce words went toward
the spot whence the sounds came. The words all came back to him in the
same angry tone.</p>
<p>5．He then went into the thicket, and looked for the boy who, as he
thought, was mocking him; but he could find nobody anywhere.</p>
<p>6．When he went home, he told his mother that some boy had hid
himself in the wood, for the purpose of mocking him.</p>
<p>7．“Robert,” said his mother, “you are angry with yourself alone. You
heard nothing but your own words.”</p>
<p>8．“Why, mother, how can that be?” said Robert. “Did you never hear
an echo?” asked his mother. “An echo, dear mother? No, ma’am. What is
it?”</p>
<p>9．“I will tell you,” said his mother. “You know, when you play with
your ball, and throw it against the side of a house, it bounds back to
you.” “Yes, mother,” said he, “and I catch it again.”</p>
<p>10．“Well,” said his mother, “if I were in the open air, by the side
of a hill or a large barn, and should speak very loud, my voice would be
sent back, so that I could hear again the very words which I spoke.”</p>
<p>11．“That, my son, is an echo. When you thought some one was mocking
you, it was only the hill before you, echoing, or sending back, your own
voice.”</p>
<p>12．“The bad boy, as you thought it was, spoke no more angrily than
yourself. If you had spoken kindly, you would have heard a kind
reply.”</p>
<p>13．“Had you spoken in a low, sweet, gentle tone, the voice that came
back would have been as low, sweet, and gentle as your own.”</p>
<p>14．“The Bible says, ’A soft answer turneth away wrath.’Remember this
when you are at play with your schoolmates.”</p>
<p>15．“If any of them should be offended, and speak in a loud, angry
tone, remember the echo, and let your words be soft and kind.”</p>
<p>16．“When you come home from school, and find your little brother
cross and peevish, speak mildly to him. You will soon see a smile on his
lips, and find that his tones will become mild and sweet.”</p>
<p>17．“Whether you are in the fields or in the woods, at school or at
play, at home or abroad, remember,</p>

<p>3．接着，罗伯特狠狠地喊道：“你一定是个傻瓜。”山谷中又传回了同样的声音：“傻瓜！”</p>

<p>10．他的妈妈说：“好的，如果我在一座大山或一个大谷仓旁边的空地上大声讲话，我的声音也会被送回来，这样我就能再次听到那些自己说过的话了。”</p>
<p>11．“孩子，这就是回声。你认为有人在嘲弄你，其实那只是你面前的大山产生了回音，它把你的声音又传了回来。”</p>
<p>12．“你想象中的那个坏孩子，也不会比你更生气地说话。如果你说些友好的话，就能听到一个友好的回答了。”</p>
<p>13．“如果你用低沉、甜美、温柔的声调说话，那个声音也会像你的声音那样低沉、甜美和温柔。”</p>
<p>14．“《圣经》里说，’回答柔和，使怒消退。’在你和同学们玩耍时也要记得这些话。”</p>
<p>15．“如果他们当中某个人生气了，大声、愤怒地讲话，这时你要牢记回声的规律，自己要用柔和友善的话语回应。”</p>
<p>16．“放学回家时，你若发现小弟弟蛮横暴躁，就温和地同他讲话。很快你就会看到他的嘴角泛起微笑，你还会发现，他的语调也变得温和甜美了。”</p>
<p>17．“无论在田野中还是在树林里，无论在学校还是在玩耍时，无论在家里还是在外面，都要记住：好人和善良之人，都会通过友好的行为来表达爱，他们永远都会生活在纯洁和真爱之中。”</p>

<p>GEORGE’S FEAST</p>
<p>乔治的美餐</p>
<p>faint collect refresh lining happiness</p>
<p>feast scarlet offered lifting strawberries</p>
<p>1．George’s mother was very poor. Instead of having bright, blazing
fires in winter, she had nothing to burn but dry sticks, which George
picked up from under the trees and hedges.</p>
<p>2．One fine day in July, she sent George to the woods, which were
about two miles from the village in which she lived. He was to stay
there all day, to get as much wood as he could collect.</p>
<p>3．It was a bright, sunny day, and George worked very hard; so that
by the time the sun was high, he was hot, and wished for a cool place
where he might rest and eat his dinner.</p>
<p>4．While he hunted about the bank, he saw among the moss some fine,
wild strawberries, which were a bright scarlet with ripeness.</p>
<p>5．“How good these will be with my bread and butter!” thought George;
and lining his little cap with leaves, he set to work eagerly to gather
all he could find, and then seated himself by the brook.</p>
<p>6．It was a pleasant place, and George felt happy and contented. He
thought how much his mother would like to see him there, and to be there
herself, instead of in her dark, close room in the village.</p>
<p>7．George thought of all this, and just as he was lifting the first
strawberry to his mouth, he said to himself, “How much mother would like
these;” and he stopped, and put the strawberry back again.</p>
<p>8．“Shall I save them for her?” said he, thinking how much they would
refresh her, yet still looking at them with a longing eye.</p>
<p>9．“I will eat half, and take the other half to her,” said he at
last; and he divided them into two heaps. But each heap looked so small,
that he put them together again.</p>
<p>10．“I will only taste one,” thought he; but, as he again lifted it
to his mouth, he saw that he had taken the finest, and he put it back.
“I will keep them all for her,” said he, and he covered them up nicely,
till he should go home.</p>
<p>11．When the sun was beginning to sink, George set out for home. How
happy he felt, then, that he had all his strawberries for his sick
mother. The nearer he came to his home, the less he wished to taste
them.</p>
<p>12．Just as he had thrown down his wood, he heard his mother’s faint
voice calling him from the next room. “Is that you, George? I am glad
you have come, for I am thirsty, and am longing for some tea.”</p>
<p>13．George ran in to her, and joyfully offered his wild strawberries.
“And you saved them for your sick mother, did you?” said she, laying her
hand fondly on his head, while the tears stood in her eyes. “God will
bless you for all this, my child.”</p>
<p>14．Could the eating of the strawberries have given George half the
happiness he felt at this moment?</p>

<p>1．乔治的妈妈非常贫穷，冬天里生不起明亮、闪烁的炉火，她只能点燃乔治从树下或篱笆旁捡来的干树枝生火取暖。</p>
<p>2．七月晴朗的一天，她让乔治到森林中去捡木柴，那个地方离他们住的村子大约有两英里远。乔治需要在森林里待上一整天，以便能尽量多地收集木柴。</p>
<p>3．那天阳光灿烂，乔治很辛苦地捡拾着木柴。等到太阳升到半空时，他已经非常热了，希望能找个凉快的地方吃点东西，休息一下。</p>
<p>4．他一路搜寻到岸边，竟然在苔藓丛中找到了一些非常诱人的熟透了的野生草莓，散发着明亮的猩红色。</p>
<p>5．“用这些草莓配上我的面包和奶油，那该多美味呀！”乔治心想。他把树叶铺在自己的小帽子里，迫不及待地把他发现的草莓都摘下来装在里面。然后，他在小溪边坐了下来。</p>
<p>6．这个地方很舒适，乔治心里既高兴又满足。他心想，要是妈妈看到自己坐在这里该多高兴，她该多么想到这里来坐坐呀，而不是整天待在村子里那间又黑暗又封闭的小屋里。</p>
<p>7．乔治一边想着，一边拿起一个草莓准备放入口中，就在这时，他自言自语道：“妈妈该多么喜欢这些草莓呀。”这时，他拿着草莓的手停了下来，又把草莓放了回去。</p>
<p>8．“我应该把草莓留给妈妈。”他说道，心里一边想着这些草莓能让妈妈恢复健康，一边又带着渴望的眼神盯着它们。</p>
<p>9．“那我就吃一半，把另一半留给她。”他终于说道，接着，他把草莓分成了两堆。但是，每一堆看上去都那么少，于是，他又把它们合在了一起。</p>
<p>10．“那我就尝一个吧，”他心里又想，但是，当他再次拿起草莓放到嘴边时，他看到自己拿起的是那个最好的草莓，于是又放了回去。“我还是把草莓都留给妈妈吧，”他一边说着，一边小心翼翼地盖好草莓，没有再动过。</p>
<p>11．太阳开始落山了，乔治决定回家。他心里多么高兴呀，他把所有的草莓都留给了生病的妈妈。越往家走，他品尝草莓的欲望也越来越小。</p>
<p>12．刚刚放下捡来的木头，他就听到隔壁房间里传来了妈妈呼唤他的虚弱声音。“是你吗，乔治？我很高兴你回来了，我太渴了，真想喝点茶。”</p>
<p>13．乔治立刻跑过去，满怀欢喜地把自己采摘来的野草莓给妈妈。“你把草莓都留给了生病的妈妈，是吗？”她一边说着，一边充满怜爱地将手放到乔治的头上，眼中充满了泪水。“上帝会保佑你的，我的孩子。”</p>
<p>14．如果乔治自己吃掉了草莓，能给自己带来此刻一半的幸福吗？</p>

<p>1．“It’s mine,” said Fred, showing a white handled pocketknife, with
every blade perfect and shining. “Just what I’ve always wanted.” And he
turned the prize over and over with evident satisfaction.</p>
<p>2．“I guess I know who owns it,” said Tom, looking at it with a
critical eye.</p>
<p>3．“I guess you don’t,” was the quick response. “It isn’t
Mr. Raymond’s,” said Fred, shooting wide of the mark.</p>
<p>4．“I know that; Mr. Raymond’s is twice as large,” observed Tom,
going on with his drawing lesson.</p>
<p>5．Do you suppose Fred took any comfort in that knife? Not a bit of
comfort did he take. He was conscious all the time of having something
in his possession that did not belong to him; and Tom’s suspicion
interfered sadly with his enjoyment.</p>
<p>6．Finally, it became such a torment to him, that he had serious
thoughts of burning it, or burying it, or giving it away; but a better
plan suggested itself.</p>
<p>7．“Tom,” said he, one day at recess, “didn’t you say you thought you
knew who owned that knife I found?”</p>
<p>8．“Yes, I did; it looked like Doctor Perry’s.” And Tom ran off to
his play, without giving the knife another thought.</p>
<p>9．Dr. Perry’s! Why, Fred would have time to go to the doctor’s
office before recess closed: so he started in haste, and found the old
gentleman getting ready to visit a patient. “Is this yours?” cried Fred,
in breathless haste, holding up the cause of a week’s anxiety.</p>
<p>10．“It was,” said the doctor; “but I lost it the other day.”</p>
<p>11．“I found it,” said Fred, “and have felt like a thief ever since.
Here, take it; I’ve got to run.”</p>
<p>12．“Hold on!” said the doctor. “I’ve got a new one, and you are
quite welcome to this.”</p>
<p>13．“Am I? May I? Oh! thank you!” And with what a different feeling
he kept it from that which he had experienced for a week!</p>

<p>1．“这是我的了，”弗雷德一边说着，一边拿出一把带手柄的白色小刀，刀锋闪闪发亮，堪称完美。“这就是我一直想要的。”他对这个战利品爱不释手，脸上泛起的满足感显而易见。</p>
<p>2．“我想我知道他的主人是谁。”汤姆说着，用略带批评的眼神看了那把小刀一眼。</p>

<p>5．你认为弗雷德会心安理得地将这把小刀据为己有吗？他一点也不安心。他一直觉得自己侵占了本不属于自己的东西；而且，汤姆的疑心也残忍地破坏了他的喜悦感。</p>
<p>6．最后，这对他竟成了一种折磨，他曾认真地考虑过要烧掉它、埋掉它、丢掉它，但后来，他想到了一个更好的主意。</p>

<p>8．“是的，我说过呀，它看上去像是佩理医生的。”汤姆说完就跑出去玩了，压根没理会那把刀的事。</p>
<p>9．是佩理医生的！怎么会呢。弗雷德在休息时间结束之前还有充足的时间去趟医生办公室。于是，他匆匆赶了过去，发现这位老先生正准备去出诊。“这是您的吗？”弗雷德举着那个让他一周都坐立不安的元凶，上气不接下气地喊道。</p>
<p>10．“是的，”医生说道，“但是，我已经丢了好几天了。”</p>
<p>11．弗雷德说：“我捡到了它，从那以后，我一直觉得自己像个小偷。就在这里，还给您吧，我得赶紧跑回去上课了。”</p>
<p>12．“等一下！”医生说，“我已经有了一把新的，这把就送给你吧。”</p>

<p>BATS</p>
<p>蝙蝠</p>
<p>1．Bats are very strange little animals, having hair like mice, and
wings like birds. During the day, they live in crevices of rocks, in
caves, and in other dark places.</p>
<p>2．At night, they go forth in search of food; and, no doubt, you have
seen them flying about, catching such insects as happen to be out rather
late at night.</p>
<p>3．The wings of a bat have no quills. They are only thin pieces of
skin stretched upon a framework of bones. Besides this, it may be said
that while he is a quadruped, he can rise into the air and fly from
place to place like a bird.</p>
<p>4．There is a funny fable about the bat, founded upon this double
character of beast and bird, which I will tell you.</p>
<p>5．An owl was once prowling about, when he came across a bat. So he
caught him in his claws, and was about to devour him. Upon this, the bat
began to squeal terribly; and he said to the owl, “Pray, what do you
take me for, that you use me thus?”</p>
<p>6．“Why, you are a bird, to be sure,” said the owl, “and I am fond of
birds. I love dearly to break their little bones.”</p>
<p>7．“Well,” said the bat, “I thought there was some mistake. I am no
bird. Don’t you see, Mr. Owl, that I have no feathers, and that I am
covered with hair like a mouse?”</p>
<p>8．“Sure enough,” said the owl, in great surprise; “I see it now.
Really, I took you for a bird, but it appears you are only a kind of
mouse. I ate a mouse last night, and it gave me the nightmare. I can’t
bear mice! Bah! it makes me sick to think of it.” So the owl let the bat
go.</p>
<p>9．The very next night, the bat encountered another danger. He was
snapped up by puss, who took him for a mouse, and immediately prepared
to eat him.</p>
<p>10．“I beg you to stop one moment,” said the bat. “Pray, Miss Puss,
what do you suppose I am?” “A mouse, to be sure!” said the cat. “Not at
all,” said the bat, spreading his long wings.</p>
<p>11．“Sure enough,” said the cat: “you seem to be a bird, though your
feathers are not very fine. I eat birds sometimes, but I am tired of
them just now, having lately devoured four young robins; so you may go.
But, bird or mouse, it will be your best policy to keep out of my way
hereafter.”</p>
<p>12．The meaning of this fable is, that a person playing a double part
may sometimes escape danger; but he is always, like the bat, a creature
that is disgusting to everybody, and shunned by all.</p>

<p>1．蝙蝠是一种非常奇怪的小动物，长着像老鼠一样的毛发和小鸟一样的翅膀。白天，它们栖息在岩石裂缝、洞穴以及其他黑暗的地方。</p>
<p>2．它们经常在夜里出来觅食，你一定见过它们飞来飞去，捕捉那些偶尔在临近深夜才出没的昆虫。</p>
<p>3．蝙蝠的翅膀上并没有翎毛，只有薄薄的皮覆盖在骨架上。除此之外，据说蝙蝠虽然是四足动物，但它也能像小鸟那样在空中飞来飞去。</p>
<p>4．由于蝙蝠具有鸟兽的双重特性，这里就有了一个关于它的有趣的寓言故事，接下来我会讲给你听。</p>
<p>5．从前有一天，一只猫头鹰在空中徘徊，它发现了一只蝙蝠。于是，它用爪子抓住了蝙蝠，准备要将它吞下去。就在这时，蝙蝠可怜巴巴地啼哭着对猫头鹰说：“求求你告诉我，你把我当谁了，为什么抓我呢？”</p>
<p>6．“为什么抓你？！当然是因为你是一只鸟，”猫头鹰说道，“我很喜欢鸟类，我最爱做的就是弄断它们的小骨头。”</p>
<p>7．蝙蝠说：“原来这样呀。我想你可能弄错了。我不是鸟，猫头鹰先生，你看我并没有羽毛，而且我身上的毛很像老鼠，难道不是吗？”</p>
<p>8．“的确如此，”猫头鹰惊讶地说道，“我现在看清楚了。真的，我还以为你是一只鸟呢，但是，现在看起来简直就是一只老鼠。我昨天晚上刚吃了一只老鼠，还让我做了一场噩梦。我再也不吃老鼠了！呸，想想都让我感到恶心！”于是，猫头鹰就放走了蝙蝠。</p>
<p>9．到了第二天，这只蝙蝠又遇到了危险。它被一只花猫逮住了，小花猫把它当成了老鼠，正准备要吃掉它。</p>
<p>10．“求求你，等一下，”这只蝙蝠说，“花猫小姐，拜托你告诉我，你把我当成什么了？”“当然是一只老鼠了！”花猫说。“我根本不是老鼠。”蝙蝠说着，立刻展开了它的翅膀。</p>
<p>11．“原来真不是老鼠呀，”花猫说，“尽管你的翅膀不那么像样，但你看上去还真像只小鸟。我有时也吃小鸟，因为最近刚吃了四只小知更鸟，已经吃够鸟肉了，你可以走了。但是，不管你是小鸟，还是老鼠，为了保险起见，今后最好不要再让我撞见你。”</p>
<p>12．这则寓言故事的意义是说，一个两面玲珑的人有时可能会逃脱危险，但他却会像蝙蝠那样遭人厌恶和嫌弃。</p>

<p>1．“I will think of it.” It is easy to say this; but do you know what
great things have come from thinking?</p>
<p>2．We can not see our thoughts, or hear, or taste, or feel them; and
yet what mighty power they have!</p>
<p>3．Sir Isaac Newton was seated in his garden on a summer’s evening,
when he saw an apple fall from a tree. He began to think, and, in trying
to find out why the apple fell, discovered how the earth, sun, moon, and
stars are kept in their places.</p>
<p>4．A boy named James Watt sat quietly by the fireside, watching the
lid of the teakettle as it moved up and down. He began to think; he
wanted to find out why the steam in the kettle moved the heavy lid.</p>
<p>5．From that time he went on thinking and thinking; and when he
became a man, he improved the steam engine so much that it could, with
the greatest ease, do the work of many horses.</p>
<p>6．When you see a steamboat, a steam mill, or a locomotive, remember
that it would never have been built if it had not been for the hard
thinking of some one.</p>
<p>7．A man named Galileo was once standing in the cathedral of Pisa,
when he saw a chandelier swaying to and fro.</p>
<p>8．This set him thinking, and it led to the invention of the
pendulum.</p>
<p>9．James Ferguson was a poor Scotch shepherd boy. Once, seeing the
inside of a watch, he was filled with wonder. “Why should I not make a
watch?” thought he.</p>
<p>10．But how was he to get the materials out of which to make the
wheels and the mainspring? He soon found how to get them: he made the
mainspring out of a piece of whalebone. He then made a wooden clock
which kept good time.</p>
<p>11．He began, also, to copy pictures with a pen, and portraits with
oil colors. In a few years, while still a small boy, he earned money
enough to support his father.</p>
<p>12．When he became a man, he went to London to live. Some of the
wisest men in England, and the king himself, used to attend his
lectures. His motto was, “I will think of it;” and he made his thoughts
useful to himself and the world.</p>
<p>13．Boys, when you have a difficult lesson to learn, don’t feel
discouraged, and ask some one to help you before helping yourselves.
Think, and by thinking you will learn how to think to some purpose.</p>

<p>1．“我要想一想。”这句话说起来容易，但是，你知道有多少伟大的事物都源于思考吗？</p>
<p>2．思维是一种我们看不到、听不见、尝不出、摸不着的东西，但它却拥有着多么强大的力量！</p>
<p>3．一个夏日的傍晚，艾萨克·牛顿先生正静坐在他的花园里时，看到一只苹果从树上掉了下来。他开始思考，试图找出苹果掉落的原因，在这个过程中，他也发现了地球、太阳、月亮和星星是如何维持自己的位置不变的。</p>
<p>4．一个叫詹姆斯·瓦特的男孩子在炉边静坐时，观察着上上下下跳动的茶壶盖。他开始思考，希望能发现壶里的蒸汽为什么能够推动沉重的壶盖。</p>
<p>5．从那时起，他就一直不停地思考；当他长大成人后，改进了蒸汽发动机，使它能够轻松地取代大量马匹劳作。</p>
<p>6．当你看到一艘汽船、一个蒸汽磨或一节火车头时，要记得如果没有某个人的努力思考，它们永远都不会出现。</p>
<p>7．一个名叫伽利略的人，有一次碰巧在比萨教堂里，看到了一只晃来晃去的吊灯。</p>
<p>8．这让他陷入了思考之中，从而最终发明了钟摆。</p>
<p>9．詹姆斯·弗格森曾经是一个贫穷的苏格兰牧童。有一次，他看到了手表的内部构造，心中充满了好奇。他想：“我为什么不能自己造一只手表呢？”</p>
<p>10．但是，如何才能找到制作齿轮和主发条的必要材料呢？很快，他想出了获取材料的方法。他用一根鲸骨制成了主发条，做成了一个木制时钟，并且时间一直跑得很准。</p>
<p>11．同时，他开始用钢笔绘制图片，用油彩临摹肖像。几年后虽然他还是个小孩子，他挣的钱足以维持自己和父亲的生活了。</p>
<p>12．长大后，他搬到伦敦居住。英国的一些学者经常聆听他的讲座，甚至连国王也是他的忠实听众。他的座右铭就是“我要想一想”，而且他的思考不仅有利于他自己，还给全世界都带来了益处。</p>
<p>13．孩子们，当你面对难题时，千万不要气馁。在寻求他人帮助之前，应该自己先想想办法。要多思考，通过思索，你将学会如何为完成某事而思考。</p>

<p>CHARLIE AND ROB</p>
<p>查理和罗伯</p>
<p>1．“Don’t you hate splitting wood?” asked Charlie, as he sat down on
a log to hinder [1] Rob for a while.</p>
<p>2．“No, I rather like it. When I get hold of a tough old fellow, I
say, ’See here, now, you think you’re the stronger, and are going to
beat me; so I’ll split you up into kindling wood.”</p>
<p>3．“Pshaw!” said Charlie, laughing; “and it’s only a stick of
wood.”</p>
<p>4．“Yes; but you see I pretend it’s a lesson, or a tough job of any
kind, and it’s nice to conquer [2] it.”</p>
<p>5．“I don’t want to conquer such things; I don’t care what becomes of
them. I wish I were a man, and a rich one.”</p>
<p>6．“Well, Charlie, if you live long enough you’ll be a man, without
wishing for it; and as for the rich part, I mean to be that myself.”</p>
<p>7．“You do. How do you expect to get your money? By sawing wood?”</p>
<p>8．“May be—some of it; that’s as good a way as any, so long as it
lasts. I don’t care how I get rich, you know, so that it’s in an honest
and useful way.”</p>
<p>9．“I’d like to sleep over the next ten years, and wake up to find
myself a young man with a splendid [3] education [4] and plenty of
money.”</p>
<p>10．“Humph! I am not sleepy—a night at a time is enough for me. I
mean to work the next ten years. You see there are things that you’ve
got to work out—you can’t sleep them out.”</p>
<p>11．“I hate work,” said Charlie, “that is, such work as sawing and
splitting wood, and doing chores [5] . I’d like to do some big work,
like being a clerk in a bank or something of that sort.”</p>
<p>12．“Wood has to be sawed and split before it can be burned,” said
Rob. “I don’t know but I’ll be a clerk in a bank some time; I’m working
towards it. I’m keeping father’s accounts for him.”</p>
<p>13．How Charlie laughed! “I should think that was a long way from
being a bank clerk. I suppose your father sells two tables and six
chairs, some days, doesn’t he?”</p>
<p>14．“Sometimes more than that, and sometimes not so much,” said Rob,
in perfect good humor.</p>
<p>15．“I didn’t say I was a bank clerk now. I said I was working
towards it. Am I not nearer it by keeping a little bit of a book than I
should be if I didn’t keep any book at all?”</p>
<p>16．“Not a whit—such things happen,” said Charlie, as he started to
go.</p>
<p>17．Now, which of these boys, do you think, grew up to be a rich and
useful man, and which of them joined a party of tramps before he was

<p>1．“难道你不讨厌劈柴吗？”查理一边说，一边坐在一根木头上，正在劈柴的罗伯不得不停下了手中的活儿。</p>
<p>2．“不会呀，我很喜欢劈柴。当我拿起一根难劈的木头时，我会说，‘瞧着吧，现在你认为自己比我强壮，想要打击我，是吗？可是我马上就会把你劈成细小的木柴的。’”</p>
<p>3．“哼！”查理笑着说，“它只不过是一根木头而已。”</p>
<p>4．“是的，但是你看，我把它当成一个难题，或者一份棘手的工作，这样就可以很容易战胜它了。”</p>
<p>5．“我不想战胜这样的东西，我也不关心它们会成为什么样子。我只希望自己能成为一个顶天立地的男子汉，成为一个大富翁。”</p>
<p>6．“好吧，查理，如果你活着，自然会成为一个男子汉，这是毋庸置疑的。至于富翁嘛，我也想成为一位富翁。”</p>
<p>7．“你也想。你打算怎么赚钱呀？就靠劈木头吗？”</p>
<p>8．“也许吧——劈柴可以赚到一部分钱，只要能够坚持下去，这也是一条不错的路。你知道吗，我并不在乎能够变得多么富有，但无论如何一定要通过诚实而有用的途径来获得财富。”</p>
<p>9．“我倒希望能美美地睡上十年，醒来后发现自己已经成了一个既有学识又有财富的年轻人。”</p>
<p>10．“哼！我才不会这样睡过去的——一次睡一宿，对我来说就足够了。我打算工作十年。你看，很多事情是靠努力工作来完成的，可不是睡觉睡出来的。”</p>
<p>11．“我讨厌工作，”查理说，“我讨厌砍柴、劈木头、做家务等。我想干一番大事业，例如在一家银行做职员，或者类似的工作。”</p>
<p>12．“木头只有被锯掉、被劈碎，才能用来燃烧呀，”罗伯说，“虽然我不知道具体什么时候，但我将来一定能成为一名银行职员，我一直在朝着这个目标努力。我一直在帮爸爸记账呢。”</p>
<p>13．查理大笑了起来：“我觉得这离当一个银行职员还远着呢，我估计，你父亲这几天也就卖掉了两张桌子、六把椅子，不是吗？”</p>
<p>14．“有时卖的会更多些，有时卖的还没这么多呢。”罗伯也不失幽默地自嘲道。</p>
<p>15．“我并没有说自己现在已经是一个银行职员了，我是说自己正朝着这个目标努力。平常记录些小账，难道不比什么也不做更接近成为银行职员的目标吗？”</p>
<p>16．“像这样的小事毫无意义。”查理说着便起身离开了。</p>
<p>17．现在，你来想想，这两个男孩中，谁将来长大后会成为富翁，成为一个有用之才，谁又会不到三十岁就流浪街头？</p>

<p>RAY AND HIS KITE</p>
<p>芮和他的风筝</p>
<p>1．Ray was thought to be an odd boy. You will think him so, too, when
you have read this story.</p>
<p>2．Ray liked well enough to play with the boys at school; yet he
liked better to be alone under the shade of some tree, reading a fairy
tale or dreaming daydreams [1] . But there was one sport that he liked
as well as his companions [2] ; that was kiteflying.</p>
<p>3．One day when he was flying his kite, he said to himself, “I wonder
if anybody ever tried to fly a kite at night. It seems to me it would be
nice. But then, if it were very dark, the kite could not be seen. What
if I should fasten a light to it, though? That would make it show. I’ll
try it this very night.”</p>
<p>4．As soon as it was dark, without saying a word to anybody, he took
his kite and lantern, and went to a large, open lot, about a quarter of
a mile from his home. “Well,” thought he, “this is queer. How lonely and
still it seems without any other boys around! But I am going to fly my
kite, anyway.”</p>
<p>5．So he tied the lantern, which was made of tin punched full of
small holes, to the tail of his kite. Then he pitched the kite, and,
after several attempts [3] , succeeded in making it rise. Up it went,
higher and higher, as Ray let out the string. When the string was all
unwound, he tied it to a fence; and then hestood and gazed at his kite
as it floated high up in the air.</p>
<p>6．While Ray was enjoying his sport, some people who were out on the
street in the village, saw a strange light in the sky. They gathered in
groups [4] to watch it. Now it was still for a few seconds, then it
seemed to be jumping up and down; then it made long sweeps [5] back and
forth through the air.</p>
<p>7．“What can it be?” said one person. “How strange!” said another.
“It can not be a comet [6] ; for comets have tails,” said a
third.”Perhaps it’s a big firefly,” said another.</p>
<p>8．At last some of the men determined [7] to find out what this
strange light was—whether it was a hobgoblin [8] dancing in the air, or
something dropped from the sky. So off they started to get as near it as
they could.</p>
<p>9．While this was taking place, Ray, who had got tired of standing,
was seated in a fence corner, behind a tree. He could see the men as
they approached; but they did not see him.</p>
<p>10．When they were directly under the light, and saw what it was,
they looked at each other, laughing, and said, “This is some boy’s
trick; and it has fooled us nicely. Let us keep the secret, and have our
share of the joke.”</p>
<p>11．Then they laughed again, and went back to the village; and some
of the simple people there have not yet found out what that strange
light was.</p>
<p>12．When the men had gone, Ray thought it was time for him to go; so
he wound up his string, picked up his kite and lantern, and went home.
His mother had been wondering what had become of him.</p>
<p>13．When she heard what he had been doing, she hardly knew whether to
laugh or scold; but I think she laughed, and told him that it was time
for him to go to bed.</p>

<p>2．在学校里，芮喜欢和其他的男孩子一起玩耍。但是，他更喜欢独自坐在树荫下，看童话故事或者做白日梦。不过，有一项体育活动让他和其他的小朋友一样着迷，那就是放风筝。</p>
<p>3．有一天，当他正在放风筝时，他自言自语地说：“我想知道，有没有人曾经在晚上放过风筝。对我来说，这样做应该很有趣。但是，如果天特别黑的话，就看不到风筝了。如果我在风筝上绑一盏灯，又会怎样呢？这样就能让人看到它了。我想在今天晚上试一试。”</p>
<p>4．等天一黑，他没有告诉任何人，独自拿着风筝和灯笼来到了一片开阔的空地上，那里离他家大约只有四分之一英里远。他心里想：“好吧，这样做的确有点奇怪。周围没有其他小朋友，是多么的孤单和寂寞呀！但是，无论如何，我一定要放飞我的风筝。”</p>
<p>5．于是，他把一个满是小孔的锡制灯笼系在风筝的尾巴上。接着，他抛出了风筝，经过几次尝试，他终于成功地将风筝升上了天空。芮松开了绳线，风筝便不断地上升，越来越高。当所有的绳线都被松开后，他把风筝线的终端绑在一根栅栏上，然后站在那里盯着自己的风筝看，而那风筝就在空中高高地飘着。</p>
<p>6．就在芮正沉浸于自己的游戏时，村子里一些在街上行走的人发现了空中奇怪的灯光。他们聚集在一起，抬头望向天空。刚刚还在静止不动的风筝，一会儿上下乱窜，一会儿又开始前前后后地飘忽不定。</p>
<p>7．“那是什么东西呀？”其中一个人问道。“多么奇怪呀！”另一个人说。“它应该不是颗彗星，因为彗星都拖着长长的尾巴，”第三个人说。“或许，它只是一只大萤火虫。”另一个人猜道。</p>
<p>8．最后，其中几个人决定去探个究竟，看看这个灯光到底是什么——是在空中乱舞的妖怪呢，还是从天上掉下来的什么东西。于是，他们开始尽可能地靠近那个灯光。</p>
<p>9．就在人们兴致勃勃地探索真相时，一直站在那里的芮感到有些疲惫，便在栅栏旁的一棵大树后面坐了下来。他能看到一些人正在慢慢走近，但那些人却看不到他。</p>
<p>10．当人们走到灯光下，看清楚它的真正面目后，互相看看，笑了起来。有人说：“这不过是哪个孩子的恶作剧，我们都被骗了。大家都保守这个秘密，就当是我们之间的笑话吧。”</p>
<p>11．然后，他们又笑了起来，纷纷返回了村子里。还有一些头脑简单的人却一直不知道那个奇怪的光到底是什么东西。</p>
<p>12．人们离开后，芮也觉得是时候回家了。于是他收起了风筝线，捡起风筝和灯笼回家了。妈妈正在纳闷，他究竟去干什么了呢。</p>
<p>13．当她听完芮的描述，都不知道应该是笑还是应该责备他了。但是，我觉得她肯定笑了，而且还会告诉芮睡觉的时间到了。</p>

<p>BEWARE OF THE FIRST DRINK</p>
<p>谨防第一次饮酒</p>
<p>1．“Uncle Philip, as the day is fine, will you take a walk with us
this morning?”</p>
<p>2．“Yes, boys. Let me get my hat and cane, and we will take a ramble.
I will tell you a story as we go. Do you know poor old Tom Smith?”</p>
<p>3．“Know him! Why, Uncle Philip, everybody knows him. He is such a
shocking drunkard, and swears so horribly [1] .”</p>
<p>4．“Well, I have known him ever since we were boys together. There
was not a more decent [2] , well-behaved boy among us. After he left
school, his father died, and he was put into a store in the city. There,
he fell into bad company.”</p>
<p>5．“Instead of spending his evenings in reading, he would go to the
theater and to balls. He soon learned to play cards, and of course to
play for money. He lost more than he could pay.”</p>
<p>6．“He wrote to his poor mother, and told her his losses. She sent
him money to pay his debts, and told him to come home.”</p>
<p>7．“He did come home. After all, he might still have been useful and
happy, for his friends were willing to forgive the past. For a time,
things went on well. He married a lovely woman, gave up his bad habits,
and was doing well.”</p>
<p>8．“But one thing, boys, ruined him forever. In the city, he had
learned to take strong drink, and he said to me once, that when a man
begins to drink, he never knows where it will end. ‘Therefore,’said Tom,
‘beware of the first drink!’”</p>
<p>9．“It was not long before he began to follow his old habit. He knew
the danger, but it seemed as if he could not resist [3] his desire to
drink. His poor mother soon died of grief and shame. His lovely wife
followed her to the grave.”</p>
<p>10．“He lost the respect of all, went on from bad to worse, and has
long been a perfect sot [4] . Last night, I had a letter from the city,
stating that Tom Smith had been found guilty [5] of stealing, and sent
to the state prison for ten years.”</p>
<p>11．“There I suppose he will die, for he is now old. It is dreadful
to think to what an end he has come. I could not but think, as I read
the letter, of what he said to me years ago, ‘Beware of the first
drink!’”</p>
<p>12．“Ah, my dear boys, when old Uncle Philip is gone, remember that
he told you the story of Tom Smith, and said to you, ‘Beware of the
first drink!’ The man who does this will never be a drunkard.”</p>

<p>2．“好的，孩子们。我去拿帽子和手杖，咱们四处逛逛，在路上我会给你们讲一个故事。你们认识那个可怜的老汉汤姆·史密斯吧？”</p>
<p>3．“认识他！他怎么了，菲利普叔叔，所有人都认识他呀。他是一个令人厌恶的酒鬼，而且整天还骂骂咧咧的。”</p>
<p>4．“是啊，我们从小就认识了。我们那群孩子中，没有一个比他更乖巧听话的了。毕业后，他的父亲去世了，他被安排到市里的一家商店里工作，在那里，他遇到了不好的伙伴。”</p>
<p>5．“他并没有利用晚上业余的时间来读书，反而去逛剧院、打球。很快，他就学会玩扑克牌了，当然是赌钱的那种。不久他就入不敷出了。”</p>
<p>6．“他给他那可怜的妈妈写信，告诉她自己输了钱，妈妈寄来钱让他还了债，还告诉他尽快回家去。”</p>
<p>7．“他确实回了家。毕竟，朋友们都愿意原谅他过去的行为，他或许依然可以成为有用之才，过上幸福的生活。有一段时间，事情进展得很顺利。他娶了一个可爱的女人做妻子，也戒掉了自己的恶习，各方面都做得很好。”</p>
<p>8．“孩子们，但是有一件事却毁了他的一生。在城市里，他学会了喝烈酒，他曾经对我说过，一个男人一旦开始酗酒，就永无终结了。汤姆说过‘因此，千万要谨慎对待自己的第一次饮酒！’”</p>
<p>9．“就在前不久，他的老毛病又犯了。他自己也知道这样很危险，但是似乎无法抵御酒瘾。他那可怜的妈妈很快就因过度悲痛和羞愧而过世了。他的爱妻不久也追随母亲离开了人世。”</p>
<p>10．“所有人都不再尊重他，情况越来越糟糕，最后他成了一个不折不扣的酒鬼。昨天晚上，我收到市里寄来的一封信，提到汤姆·史密斯因盗窃罪被送进州监狱服役十年。”</p>
<p>11．“我猜他的余生都将会在监狱中度过，因为他现在已经老了。一想到他的结局，我就非常悲痛。当我读到这封信时，禁不住想起几年前他对我说的话，‘要当心第一次饮酒！’”</p>
<p>12．“啊，我亲爱的孩子们，菲利普叔叔过世后，你们要记得他曾经给你们讲述过的汤姆·史密斯的故事，并且还对你们说过，’要当心第一次饮酒！’能做到这一点，永远不会成为一个醉鬼。”</p>

<p>THE SEVEN STICKS</p>
<p>七根棍子</p>
<p>1．A man had seven sons, who were always quarreling. They left their
studies and work, to quarrel among themselves. Some bad men were looking
forward to the death of their father, to cheat [1] them out of their
property [2] by making them quarrel about it.</p>
<p>2．The good old man, one day, called his sons around him. He laid
before them seven sticks, which were bound together. He said, “I will
pay a hundred dollars to the one who can break this bundle [3] .”</p>
<p>3．Each one strained every nerve [4] to break the bundle. After a
long but vain trial, they all said that it could not be done.</p>
<p>4．“And yet, my boys,” said the father, “nothing is easier to do.” He
then untied the bundle, and broke the sticks, one by one, with perfect
ease.</p>
<p>5．“Ah!” said his sons, “it is easy enough to do it so; anybody could
do it in that way.”</p>
<p>6．Their father replied, “As it is with these sticks, so is it with
you, my sons. So long as you hold fast together and aid each other, you
will prosper [5] , and none can injure you.”</p>
<p>7．“But if the bond of union [6] be broken, it will happen to you
just as it has to these sticks, which lie here broken on the

<p>2．有一天，这位善良的老人把儿子们都召集到身边，把绑在一起的七根棍子放在他们面前，说：“谁能把这一捆棍子折断，我就奖励他一百美元。”</p>

<p>4．“其实不然，我的孩子们，”父亲说道，“没有比这更容易做到的事情了。”说完他解开了绳子，毫不费劲地就把那七根棍子一根一根地折断了。</p>
<p>5．“啊！”儿子们纷纷说道，“这么做太容易了。用这种方式，谁都能把棍子折断。”</p>

<p>THE MOUNTAIN SISTER</p>
<p>山妹子</p>
<p>1．The home of little Jeannette is far away, high up among the
mountains. Let us call her our mountain sister.</p>
<p>2．There are many things you would like to hear about her, but I can
only tell you now how she goes with her father and brother, in the
autumn, to help gather nuts for the long winter.</p>
<p>3．A little way down the mountain side is a chestnut [1] wood. Did
you ever see a chestnut tree? In the spring its branches are covered
with bunches of creamy flowers, like long tassels [2] . All the hot
summer these are turning into sweet nuts, wrapped [3] safely in large,
prickly [4] , green balls.</p>
<p>4．But when the frost of autumn comes, these prickly balls turn
brown, and crack open. Then you may see inside one, two, three, and even
four, sweet, brown nuts.</p>
<p>5．When her father says, one night at supper time, “I think there
will be a frost tonight,” Jeannette knows very well what to do. She
dances away early in the evening to her little bed, made in a box built
up against the wall.</p>
<p>6．Soon she falls asleep to dream about the chestnut wood, and the
little brook that springs from rock to rock down under the tall, dark
trees. She wakes with the first daylight, and is out of bed in a minute,
when she hears her father’s cheerful call, “Come, children; it is time
to be off.”</p>
<p>7．Their dinner is ready in a large basket. The donkey stands before
the door with great bags for the nuts hanging at each side. They go
merrily over the crisp [5] , white frost to the chestnut trees. How the
frost has opened the burs [6] ! It has done half their work for them
already.</p>
<p>8．How they laugh and sing, and shout to each other as they fill
their baskets! The sun looks down through the yellow leaves; the rocks
give them mossy seats; the birds and squirrels wonder what these strange
people are doing in their woods.</p>
<p>9．Jeannette really helps, though she is only a little girl; and her
father says at night, that his Jane is a dear, good child. This makes
her very happy. She thinks about it at night, when she says her prayers.
Then she goes to sleep to dream of the merry autumn days.</p>
<p>10．Such is our little mountain sister, and here is a picture of her
far-away home. The mountain life is ever a fresh and happy one.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-206">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．小珍妮特的家很远，在高耸的大山里，我们就叫她山妹子吧！</p>
<p>2．关于她的许多故事你一定都很想听，可是现在我只告诉你，她在秋天里帮父亲和哥哥采摘坚果，储备过冬食物的情形。</p>
<p>3．顺着山坡向下走一点点路，有一片栗子林。你见过栗子树吗？春天里，栗子树的枝干上开满了一簇簇奶油般的花朵，就像是长长的流苏。夏天，这些花儿会变成甜美的板栗，完好无损地被多刺的绿色大球球包裹着。</p>
<p>4．秋季霜天过后，这些带刺的球球变成褐色，爆裂开来，这时你会看见里面有一个、两个、三个，甚至四个褐色的甜栗子。</p>
<p>5．一天的晚饭时分，珍妮特的父亲说：“我觉得今天晚上会下霜。”珍妮特非常清楚接下来要做什么。当天晚上，她早早地就一蹦一跳地上床睡觉，她的小床就在靠墙的一个大箱子里。</p>
<p>6．很快她就进入了梦乡，梦见了那片栗子林，还有在高大浓密的栗子树下那石头间奔腾的小溪。第一缕晨光刚刚升起，她就醒了。当听到父亲兴高采烈地呼喊：“来吧，孩子们，该出发了。”她便一股脑儿从床上爬了起来。</p>
<p>7．他们的午餐已经备好，装在一个大篮子里。驴子已经候在门外，两侧驮着用来装栗子的大袋子。他们满怀喜悦地踏过易脆的白霜，向栗子林进发。秋霜已经打开了那么多刺果！已经帮他们干了一半的活儿。</p>
<p>8．他们又笑又唱，一边互相喊话，一边把栗子往袋子里装，多么快乐啊！太阳透过金黄的叶子俯视着他们；岩石为他们准备好了铺满青苔的座位；小鸟和松鼠好奇地看着他们，嘀咕着这些奇怪的人到底在它们的树林里做什么。</p>
<p>9．虽然珍妮特只是一个小姑娘，但却是个好帮手。晚上她的父亲说，小珍妮特是个惹人疼爱的乖孩子，这让她非常高兴。晚上祈祷的时候，她想到了这些，然后上床睡觉，做起了愉快的秋天之梦。</p>
<p>10．这就是我们的山妹子，这就是她那遥远的家的一个画面。山里人的生活永远是充满生机，快乐幸福的。</p>

<p>THE MONEY AMY DIDN’T EARN</p>
<p>艾米没有赚到的钱</p>
<p>1．Amy was a dear little girl, but she was too apt to waste time in
getting ready to do her tasks [1] , instead of doing them at once as she
ought.</p>
<p>2．In the village in which she lived, Mr. Thornton kept a store where
he sold fruit of all kinds, including berries in their season [2] . One
day he said to Amy, whose parents were quite poor, “Would you like to
earn some money?”</p>
<p>3．“Oh, yes,” replied she, “for I want some new shoes, and papa has
no money to buy them with.”</p>
<p>4．“Well, Amy,” said Mr. Thornton, “I noticed some fine, ripe
blackberries in Mr. Green’s pasture today, and he said that anybody was
welcome to them. I will pay you thirteen cents a quart [3] for all you
will pick for me.”</p>
<p>5．Amy was delighted at the thought of earning some money; so she ran
home to get a basket, intending to go immediately to pick the
berries.</p>
<p>6．Then she thought she would like to know how much money she would
get if she picked five quarts. With the help of her slate and pencil,
she found out that she would get sixty-five cents.</p>
<p>7．“But supposing I should pick a dozen quarts,” thought she, “how
much should I earn then?” “Dear me,” she said, after figuring [4] a
while, “I should earn a dollar and fifty-six cents.”</p>
<p>8．Amy then found out what Mr. Thornton would pay her for fifty, a
hundred, and two hundred quarts. It took her some time to do this, and
then it was so near dinner time that she had to stay at home until
afternoon.</p>
<p>9．As soon as dinner was over, she took her basket and hurried [5] to
the pasture. Some boys had been there before dinner, and all the ripe
berries were picked. She could not find enough to fill a quart measure
[6] .</p>
<p>10．As Amy went home, she thought of what her teacher had often told
her—“Do your task at once; then think about it,” for “one doer is worth
a hundred dreamers.”</p>

<p>3．“噢，当然想，”她回答说，“因为我想买双新鞋子，可是爸爸没有钱给我买。”</p>
<p>4．“那好，艾米，”桑顿先生说，“今天我看到格林先生的牧场上有一些成熟了的漂亮黑莓，他说欢迎大家去采摘。你去帮我摘些回来，每一夸脱我将付给你十三美分。”</p>
<p>5．想到可以赚钱，艾米非常高兴。于是她跑回家去取篮子，打算立即就去采摘黑莓。</p>
<p>6．就在那时，她想知道如果她采摘到五夸脱黑莓的话，将会赚到多少钱。用铅笔在石板上算了一阵儿，她算出她将会得到六十五美分。</p>
<p>7．“可要是我能摘到十二夸脱呢，”她又想，“那我又该赚到多少钱呢？”“哎呀，”算了一会儿以后，她说，“我将会赚到一美元五十六美分。”</p>
<p>8．接着艾米又算出了如果她采摘到五十夸脱、一百夸脱甚至两百夸脱黑莓的话，桑顿先生分别该付给她多少钱。这浪费了她不少时间，这时已经快到午饭时间了，所以她不得不留在家里，等到下午再动身。</p>
<p>9．吃完午饭，艾米拿起篮子，匆匆忙忙向牧场赶去。有些男孩子在午饭前就已经到那里了，所有成熟了的黑莓都被摘走了。她只找到了不足一夸脱的黑莓。</p>
<p>10．在回家的路上，艾米想起了老师经常对她说的话——“立刻去做应该做的事，然后再去思考。”因为，“一个实干家抵得上一百个梦想家。”</p>

<p>DEEDS OF KINDNESS</p>
<p>善举</p>
<p>1．One day, as two little boys were walking along the road, they
overtook a woman carrying a large basket of apples.</p>
<p>2．The boys thought the woman looked very pale and tired; so they
said, “Are you going to town? If you are, we will carry your
basket.”</p>
<p>3．“Thank you,” replied the woman, “you are very kind: you see I am
weak and ill.” Then she told them that she was a widow [1] , and had a
lame son to support.</p>
<p>4．She lived in a cottage three miles away, and was now going to
market to sell the apples which grew on the only tree in her little
garden. She wanted the money to pay her rent.</p>
<p>5．“We are going the same way you are,” said the boys. “Let us have
the basket;” and they took hold of it, one on each side, and trudged [2]
along with merry hearts.</p>
<p>6．The poor widow looked glad, and said that she hoped their mother
would not be angry with them. “Oh, no,” they replied; “our mother has
taught us to be kind to everybody, and to be useful in any way that we
can.”</p>
<p>7．She then offered to give them a few of the ripest apples for their
trouble. “No, thank you,” said they; “we do not want any pay for what we
have done.”</p>
<p>8．When the widow got home, she told her lame son what had happened
on the road, and they were both made happier that day by the kindness of
the two boys.</p>
<p>9．The other day, I saw a little girl stop and pick up a piece of
orange peel, which she threw into the gutter [3] . “I wish the boys
would not throw orange peel on the sidewalk,” said she. “Some one may
tread [4] upon it, and fall.”</p>
<p>10．“That is right, my dear,” I said. “It is a little thing for you
to do what you have done, but it shows that you have a thoughtful mind
and a feeling heart.”</p>
<p>11．Perhaps some may say that these are little things. So they are;
but we must not wait for occasions [5] to do great things. We must begin
with little labors of love.</p>

<p>1．有一天，两个小男孩走在路上的时候，遇上了一个提着一大篮子苹果的妇人。</p>
<p>2．两个男孩觉得妇人看起来又虚弱又疲惫，于是上前问道：“您是要进城吗？如果是的话，我们来帮您提篮子吧。”</p>
<p>3．“谢谢你们，”妇人回答，“你们真好，看我体弱生病而帮助我。”接着她告诉他们，她是个寡妇，还抚养着一个瘸腿的儿子。</p>
<p>4．她住在三英里外的一座小农舍里，现在是要到集市上，把从自家小花园里唯一的树上摘下来的苹果卖掉。她需要些钱交房租。</p>
<p>5．“我们和您同路，”男孩们说，“让我们提着篮子吧。”然后他们把篮子接了过来，一人一边抬着走，虽然走起来费劲吃力，但心情却很愉快。</p>
<p>6．可怜的寡妇看上去非常高兴，说她希望他们的父母不会为此而生他们的气。“噢，不会的，”他们回答道，“妈妈教导我们要友善地对待所有人，并且尽力做有用之人。”</p>
<p>7．接着妇人提出要给他们几个最红的苹果，作为麻烦他们的酬劳。“不，谢谢您，”他们说，“我们做这些事情不需要任何报酬。”</p>
<p>8．寡妇回到家里以后，把路上发生的事情告诉了跛腿的儿子。那一天他们俩都因为两个男孩的善举而更加快乐。</p>
<p>9．第二天，我看见一个小姑娘停下来，捡起一块橙皮，把它丢到了路边的沟里。“我希望那些男孩们不要把果皮扔在人行道上，”她说，“会有人踩到果皮，然后摔倒。”</p>
<p>10．“说得对，亲爱的，”我说，“你刚刚做的事情对你来说只是举手之劳，却体现出你是个体贴人而富有同情心的小姑娘。”</p>

<p>THE ALARM CLOCK</p>
<p>闹钟</p>
<p>1．A lady, who found it not easy to wake in the morning as early as
she wished, bought an alarm [1] clock. These clocks are so made as to
strike with a loud whirring [2] noise at any hour the owner pleases to
set them.</p>
<p>2．The lady placed her clock at the head of the bed, and at the right
time she found herself roused [3] by the long, rattling [4] sound.</p>
<p>3．She arose at once, and felt better all day for her early rising.
This lasted for some weeks. The alarm clock faithfully [5] did its duty
[6] , and was plainly heard so long as it was obeyed.</p>
<p>4．But, after a time, the lady grew tired of early rising. When she
was waked by the noise, she merely [7] turned over in bed, and slept
again.</p>
<p>5．In a few days, the clock ceased to rouse her from her sleep. It
spoke just as loudly as ever; but she did not hear it, because she had
been in the habit of not obeying it.</p>
<p>6．Finding that she might as well be without it, she resolved that
when she heard the sound she would jump up.</p>
<p>7．Just so it is with conscience [8] . If we will obey its voice,
even in the most trifling [9] things, we can always hear it, clear and
strong.</p>
<p>8．But if we allow [10] ourselves to do what we have some fears may
not be quite right, we shall grow more and more sleepy, until the voice
of conscience has no longer power to wake us.</p>

<p>TRUE COURAGE</p>
<p>真正的勇敢</p>
<p>One cold winter’s day, three boys were passing by a schoolhouse. The
oldest was a bad boy, always in trouble himself, and trying to get
others into trouble. The youngest, whose name was George, was a very
good boy.</p>
<p>George wished to do right, but was very much wanting in courage. The
other boys were named Henry and James. As they walked along, they talked
as follows:</p>
<p>Henry: What fun it would be to throw a snowball against the
schoolroom door, and make the teacher and scholars [1] all jump!</p>
<p>James: You would jump, if you should. If the teacher did not catch
you and whip you, he would tell your father, and you would get a
whipping [2] then; and that would make you jump higher than the
scholars, I think.</p>
<p>Henry: Why, we would get so far off, before the teacher could come to
the door, that he could not tell who we are. Here is a snowball just as
hard as ice, and George would as soon throw it against the door as
not.</p>
<p>James: Give it to him, and see. He would not dare [3] to throw
it.</p>
<p>Henry: Do you think George is a coward? You do not know him as well
as I do. Here, George, take this snowball, and show James that you are
not such a coward as he thinks you are.</p>
<p>George: I am not afraid to throw it; but I do not want to. I do not
see that it will do any good, or that there will be any fun in it.</p>
<p>James: There! I told you he would not dare to throw it.</p>
<p>Henry: Why, George, are you turning coward? I thought you did not
fear anything. Come, save your credit [4] , and throw it. I know you are
not afraid.</p>
<p>George: Well, I am not afraid to throw. Give me the snowball. I would
as soon throw it as not.</p>
<p>Whack! went the snowball against the door; and the boys took to their
heels. Henry was laughing as heartily [5] as he could, to think what a
fool he had made of George.</p>
<p>George had a whipping for his folly, as he ought to have had. He was
such a coward, that he was afraid of being called a coward. He did not
dare refuse [6] to do as Henry told him, for fear that he would be
laughed at.</p>
<p>If he had been really a brave boy, he would have said, “Henry, do you
suppose that I am so foolish as to throw that snowball, just because you
want to have me? You may throw your own snowballs, if you please!”</p>
<p>Henry would, perhaps, have laughed at him, and called him a
coward.</p>
<p>But George would have said, “Do you think that I care for your
laughing? I do not think it right to throw the snowball. I will not do
that which I think to be wrong, if the whole town should join with you
in laughing.”</p>
<p>This would have been real courage. Henry would have seen, at once,
that it would do no good to laugh at a boy who had so bold a heart. You
must have this fearless [7] spirit, or you will get into trouble, and
will be, and ought to be, disliked [8] by all.</p>

<p>一个寒冷的冬日，三个男孩路过一所学校。年纪最大的那个男孩是个坏孩子，总是惹麻烦，还试图把别人也扯进去。他们当中年纪最小的那个，名叫乔治，是个非常乖的男孩子。</p>
<p>乔治愿意做正确的事情，但是非常缺乏勇气。另外两个男孩，一个叫亨利，一个叫詹姆斯。他们边走边谈，内容是这样的：</p>
<p>亨利：
要是扔一个雪球去砸教室的门，把老师和学生都吓得跳起来，那该有多好玩呀！</p>
<p>詹姆斯：
你那么做的话，跳起来的那个人就是你！就算老师没有抓住你，用教鞭抽你，他也会告诉你爸爸，那样你也得挨一顿揍。我想，那会儿你比那些学生跳得更高吧。</p>
<p>亨利：
什么呀，不等老师开门出来，我们早已经跑得很远了，他根本就认不出我们是谁。这儿有个像冰块一样硬的雪球，而且，乔治会很乐意把它砸到门上的。</p>
<p>詹姆斯： 把雪球给他，看看怎么样。他才不敢扔呢。</p>
<p>亨利：
你以为乔治是个胆小鬼吗？你没有我了解他。来，乔治，拿着这个雪球，让詹姆斯看看你并不是他所想的那样是个胆小鬼。</p>
<p>乔治：
我不是不敢扔，而是我不想这么做。我认为这么做没有任何益处，也看不出这有什么好玩。</p>
<p>詹姆斯： 看吧！我就说他不敢扔。</p>
<p>亨利：
不是吧，乔治，你真的变成胆小鬼了吗？我还以为你什么都不怕。来吧，为了你的尊严，把雪球扔出去。我知道你并不害怕。</p>
<p>乔治： 好吧，我并不害怕。把雪球给我。我很乐意把它扔出去。</p>
<p>“砰”的一声，一击即中！雪球砸在了门上。那两个男孩马上溜之大吉。亨利想到乔治被愚弄的情景，尽情地哈哈大笑起来。</p>
<p>乔治为他的愚蠢挨了一顿打，这是他应该受到的惩罚。他真是个胆小鬼，他害怕别人说他是胆小鬼。他不敢拒绝亨利叫他做的事情，因为害怕会因此受到嘲笑。</p>
<p>如果他是一个真正勇敢的孩子，他应该说：“亨利，你以为我会那么笨，只是因为你想要我扔那个雪球，我就会照做吗？你要是愿意的话，你完全可以自己扔！”</p>
<p>也许，亨利会嘲笑他，叫他胆小鬼。</p>
<p>然而乔治可以这么说：“你以为我会在乎你的嘲笑吗？我认为扔这个雪球是不对的。哪怕全镇的人都跟你一起嘲笑我，我也不去做我认为是错误的事情。”</p>
<p>这才是真正的勇敢。亨利马上就会看到，嘲笑一个有着如此勇敢的心的男孩没有任何好处。你必须有这种无畏的精神，否则你会陷入麻烦当中，而你将会，也应该会，遭到所有人的厌恶。</p>

<p>THE WAVES</p>
<p>海浪</p>
<p>1．“Where are we to go?” said the little waves to the great, deep
sea. “Go, my darlings, to the yellow sands: you will find work to do
there.”</p>
<p>2．“I want to play,” said one little wave; “I want to see who can
jump the highest.”</p>
<p>“No; come on, come on,” said an earnest wave; “mother must be right.
I want to work.”</p>
<p>3．“Oh, I dare not go,” said another; “look at those great, black
rocks close to the sands; I dare not go there, for they will tear me to
pieces.”</p>
<p>4．“Take my hand, sister,” said the earnest wave; “let us go on
together. How glorious it is to do some work.”</p>
<p>5．“Shall we ever go back to mother?” “Yes, when our work is
done.”</p>
<p>6．So one and all hurried on. Even the little wave that wanted to
play, pressed [1] on, and thought that work might be fun after all. The
timid [2] ones did not like to be left behind, and they became earnest
as they got nearer the sands.</p>
<p>7．After all, it was fun, pressing on one after another—jumping,
laughing, running on to the broad, shining sands.</p>
<p>8．First, they came in their course to a great sand castle.
Splash,</p>
<p>splash! they all went over it, and down it came. “Oh, what fun!” they
cried.</p>
<p>9．“Mother told me to bring these seaweeds; I will find a pretty
place for them,” said one—and she ran a long way over the sands, and
left them among the pebbles. The pebbles cried, “We are glad you are
come. We wanted washing.”</p>
<p>10．“Mother sent these shells; I don’t know where to put them,” said
a little fretful [3] wave. “Lay them one by one on the sand, and do not
break them,” said the eldest [4] wave.</p>
<p>11．And the little one went about its work, and learned to be quiet
and gentle, for fear of breaking the shells.</p>
<p>12．“Where is my work?” said a great, full-grown wave. “This is mere
play. The little ones can do this and laugh over it. Mother said there
was work for me.” And he came down upon some large rocks.</p>
<p>13．Over the rocks and into a pool he went, and he heard the fishes
say, “The sea is coming. Thank you, great sea; you always send a big
wave when a storm is nigh. Thank you, kind wave; we are all ready for
you now.”</p>
<p>14．Then the waves all went back over the wet sands, slowly and
carelessly, for they were tired.</p>
<p>15．“All my shells are safe,” said one.</p>
<p>16．And, “My seaweeds are left behind,” said another.</p>
<p>17．“I washed all of the pebbles,” said a third.</p>
<p>18．“And I—I only broke on a rock, and splashed into a pool,” said
the one that was so eager to work. “I have done no good, mother—no work
at all.”</p>
<p>19．“Hush!” said the sea. And they heard a child that was walking on
the shore, say, “O mother, the sea has been here! Look, how nice and
clean the sand is, and how clear the water is in that pool.”</p>
<p>20．Then the sea, said, “Hark!” and far away they heard the deep
moaning [5] of the coming storm.</p>
<p>21．“Come, my darlings,” said she; “you have done your work, now let
the storm do its work.”</p>

<p>1．“我们要去哪里？”小海浪们对伟大而深沉的大海说。</p>
<p>“去吧……亲爱的孩子们，去那金黄色的沙滩，你们会在那里找到可以做的事情的。”</p>
<p>2．“我想去玩耍，”其中一朵小海浪说，“我想看看谁能跳得最高。”</p>
<p>“不，来吧，来吧，”一朵充满干劲的海浪说，“妈妈一定是对的。我想找些事情做。”</p>
<p>3．“哦，我可不敢去，”另外一朵说，“你们看那些沙滩附近的岩石，又大又黑，我不敢过去，他们会把我撕成碎片的。”</p>
<p>4．“拉着我的手，妹妹，”充满干劲的海浪说，“我们一起去。有所作为是多么光荣！”</p>
<p>5．“我们还能回到妈妈身边吗？”“会的，当我们完成任务之后。”</p>
<p>6．于是一波接一波的海浪争相赶来。甚至那朵只想玩耍的小海浪也紧随而去，心想要做的事情也许还是有趣的。胆小的那些不愿意被甩在后面，于是在更接近沙滩的时候，他们变得干劲十足。</p>
<p>7．那是多么有趣的事儿，一朵接一朵的海浪——跳着、笑着、跑着，向着宽阔、闪闪发光的沙滩进发。</p>
<p>8．在前进的道路上，他们首先奔向一座了不起的沙堡。飞奔，飞奔！他们全都越过了沙堡，沙堡倒塌了。“哦，真好玩！”他们欢呼着。</p>
<p>9．一朵海浪说：“妈妈叫我带这些海藻来，我要为他们找个好地方。”她在沙滩上跑了很长的路，把海藻洒在了卵石中间。卵石们喊道：“我们很高兴你们来了。我们需要好好洗洗。”</p>
<p>10．“妈妈让我们带这些贝壳来，可是该把他们放哪里呢？”一朵焦躁的小海浪说。“把他们一个个放在沙滩上，不要打碎他们。”最前面的海浪告诉她。</p>
<p>11．小的那朵带着她的任务去了，学着安静而温柔地行动，生怕打碎了那些贝壳。</p>
<p>12．“我的任务在哪里？”一朵巨大的、个头长足的海浪问。“这些事情不过是玩耍。那些小海浪们可以做，并且乐在其中。妈妈说有专门任务给我的。”说着他落到一些巨大的岩石上。</p>
<p>13．他越过岩石，跳进一个池塘里，这时他听到鱼儿说：“海水来了。谢谢你，大海。每当暴风雨要来的时候，你总是送来一个巨浪。谢谢你，仁慈的海浪；现在我们全都准备好了，迎接你的到来。”</p>
<p>14．之后，所有海浪都沿着潮湿的沙滩往回走，他们走得很慢，漫不经心地，因为他们都累了。</p>
<p>15．“我所有的贝壳都安然无恙。”一个说。</p>
<p>16．“还有我的海藻也留在那儿了。”另一个说。</p>
<p>17．“我也清洗了所有的卵石。”第三个说。</p>
<p>18．“而我——我只是撞击到一块岩石上，然后溅落到一个池塘里，”那朵最急于要有所作为的浪花说，“我没有做好，妈妈——我什么都没做成。”</p>
<p>19．“嘘！”大海示意。他们听见岸边的一个小孩边走边说：“哦，妈妈，海水来过这里！看，沙滩多干净多漂亮，还有那个池子里的水多么清澈！”</p>
<p>20．然后，大海又说：“听！”他们听到远方传来即将到来的暴风雨深沉的低吟。</p>
<p>21．“来吧，我亲爱的孩子们，”她说，“你们已经完成了你们的任务，现在轮到暴风雨登场了。”</p>

<p>WHEN TO SAY NO</p>
<p>什么时候说“不”</p>
<p>1．Though “No” is a very little word, it is not always easy to say
it; and the not doing so, often causes [1] trouble.</p>
<p>2．When we are asked to stay away from school, and spend in idleness
[2] or mischief the time which ought to be spent in study, we should at
once say “No.”</p>
<p>3．When we are urged [3] to loiter [4] on our way to school, and thus
be late, and interrupt [5] our teacher and the school, we should
say”No.” When some schoolmate wishes us to whisper or play in the
schoolroom, we should say “No.”</p>
<p>4．When we are tempted [6] to use angry or wicked words, we should
remember that the eye of God is always upon us, and should say “No.”</p>
<p>5．When we have done anything wrong, and are tempted to conceal [7]
it by falsehood [8] , we should say “No, we can not tell a lie; it is
wicked and cowardly.”</p>
<p>6．If we are asked to do anything which we know to be wrong, we
should not fear to say “No.”</p>
<p>7．If we thus learn to say “No,” we shall avoid much trouble, and be
always safe.</p>

<p>1．虽然“不”是个很简单的词语，要说出来却并不容易；而有时候不说出来，却会招来麻烦。</p>
<p>2．如果有人叫我们逃学，把本该学习的时间虚度或者用来调皮捣蛋，我们应该马上说“不”。</p>
<p>3．如果有人怂恿我们上学路上闲逛，结果迟到，打断老师和大家上课，我们应该说“不”。当有的同学想让我们在课堂上交头接耳或玩耍时，我们应该说“不”。</p>
<p>4．当有人引诱我们使用愤怒或者邪恶的言语时，我们应该知道上帝的眼睛无时无刻不在关注着我们，我们应该说“不”。</p>
<p>5．当我们做错了事情，却想用谎话来掩饰时，我们应该说“不，我们不能说谎，那是邪恶而懦弱的行为”。</p>
<p>6．如果有人要我们去做自己明知不对的事情，我们应该勇敢无畏地说“不。”</p>
<p>7．如果我们可以就此学会说“不”，我们就会避免很多麻烦，处世平安。</p>

<p>JOHN CARPENTER</p>
<p>约翰·卡朋特</p>
<p>1．John Carpenter did not like to buy toys that somebody else had
made. He liked the fun of making them himself. The thought that they
were his own work delighted him.</p>
<p>2．Tom Austin, one of his playmates, thought a toy was worth nothing
unless it cost a great deal of money. He never tried to make anything,
but bought all his toys.</p>
<p>3．“Come and look at my horse,” said he, one day. “It cost a dollar,
and it is such a beauty! Come and see it.”</p>
<p>4．John was soon admiring [1] his friend’s horse; and he was
examining [2] it carefully, to see how it was made. The same evening he
began to make one for himself.</p>
<p>5．He went into the wood shed, and picked out two pieces of wood—one
for the head of his horse, the other for the body. It took him two or
three days to shape them to his satisfaction.</p>
<p>6．His father gave him a bit of red leather [3] for a bridle, and a
few brass nails, and his mother found a bit of old fur with which he
made a mane and tail for his horse.</p>
<p>7．But what about the wheels? This puzzled [4] him. At last he
thought he would go to a turner’s [5] shop, and see if he could not get
some round pieces of wood which might suit his purpose.</p>
<p>8．He found a large number of such pieces among the shavings [6] on
the floor, and asked permission [7] to take a few of them. The turner
asked him what he wanted them for, and he told him about his horse.</p>
<p>9．“Oh,” said the man, laughing, “if you wish it, I will make some
wheels for your horse. But mind, when it is finished, you must let me
see it.”</p>
<p>10．John promised to do so, and he soon ran home with the wheels in
his pocket. The next evening, he went to the turner’s shop with his
horse all complete [8] , and was told that he was an ingenious [9]
little fellow.</p>
<p>11．Proud of this compliment [10] , he ran to his friend Tom,
crying,“Now then, Tom, here is my horse,—look!”</p>
<p>12．“Well, that is a funny horse,” said Tom; “where did you buy it?”
“I didn’t buy it,” replied John; “I made it.”</p>
<p>13．“You made it yourself ! Oh, well, it’s a good horse for you to
make. But it is not so good as mine. Mine cost a dollar, and yours
didn’t cost anything.”</p>
<p>14．“It was real fun to make it, though,” said John, and away he ran
with his horse rolling after him.</p>
<p>15．Do you want to know what became of John? Well, I will tell you.
He studied hard in school, and was called the best scholar in his class.
When he left school, he went to work in a machine shop. He is now a
master workman, and will soon have a shop of his own.</p>

<p>1．约翰·卡朋特不喜欢买那些别人做的玩具。他享受自己动手制作玩具的乐趣。想到那是自己的作品，他就会高兴。</p>
<p>2．汤姆·奥斯汀是约翰的一个玩伴，他认为一件玩具只有花很多钱买回来才值钱，否则就一文不值。他从来不会自己做任何东西，所有的玩具都是买回来的。</p>
<p>3．“来看看我的玩具马，”有一天，他说，“它值一美元呢，它是多么漂亮啊！快来看！”</p>
<p>4．很快约翰就喜欢上了朋友的玩具马，他认真地查看，研究它是怎么做成的。当天晚上，他就开始自己动手做。</p>
<p>5．他走进木棚，挑了两块木头——一块用来做马头，另一块做马的身子。他花了两三天才做出自己满意的造型。</p>
<p>6．他的父亲给了他一块红色的皮革做缰绳，还给了他一些铜钉，母亲帮他找到一小片旧的毛皮，他用这个做了马的鬃毛和尾巴。</p>
<p>7．可是车轮怎么办呢？这可把他难住了。最后他想到可以到车工的店里，看看是否能找到圆形的木片，也许可以达到他的目的。</p>
<p>8．他在地上的刨花堆里找到了很多这样的木片，征得同意后他拿了一些。车工问他要这些木片来做什么，他跟他说起了他的玩具马。</p>
<p>9．“哦，”那个人笑着说，“你要是想要，我可以为你的小马做几个轮子。不过要记住，你做好以后，要给我看看。”</p>
<p>10．约翰答应了，很快他就带着口袋里的轮子回家了。第二天晚上，他带着完工了的玩具去车工的店里，车工夸他是个心灵手巧的小家伙。</p>
<p>11．这样的夸奖让约翰感到很自豪，他跑到好朋友汤姆那里，大声说：“现在，看看，汤姆，这是我的马——看！”</p>
<p>12．“嗯，这匹马很有趣，”汤姆说，“你在哪里买的？”“我没有花钱买，”约翰回答说，“我自己做的。”</p>
<p>13．“你自己做的？哦，好吧，你的马不错，不过没有我的好。我的马值一美元，你的一分钱都不值。”</p>
<p>14．“但是自己动手做真的很有意思。”说完约翰就跑开了，他的马在身后跟着他跑。</p>
<p>15．你想知道约翰后来成为什么样的人了吗？好，我来告诉你。他在学校里努力学习，被认为是他们班上最好的学生。离开学校后，他去了一个机械修理店工作。现在他已经是一个工长，很快他就要拥有自己的店了。</p>

<p>THE CONTENTED BOY</p>
<p>知足的男孩</p>
<p>Mr. Lenox was one morning riding by himself. He got off from his
horse to look at something on the roadside. The horse broke away from
him, and ran off. Mr. Lenox ran after him, but soon found that he could
not catch him.</p>
<p>A little boy at work in a field near the road, heard the horse. As
soon as he saw him running from his master, the boy ran very quickly to
the middle of the road, and, catching the horse by the bridle, stopped
him till Mr. Lenox came up.</p>
<p>Mr. Lenox: Thank you, my good boy, you have caught my horse very
nicely. What shall I give you for your trouble?</p>
<p>Boy: I want nothing, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. L: You want nothing? So much the better for you. Few men can say
as much. But what were you doing in the field?</p>
<p>B: I was rooting [1] up weeds, and tending [2] the sheep that were
feeding on turnips [3] .</p>
<p>Mr. L: Do you like to work?</p>
<p>B: Yes, sir, very well, this fine weather [4] .</p>
<p>Mr. L: But would you not rather play?</p>
<p>B: This is not hard work. It is almost as good as play.</p>
<p>Mr. L: Who set you to work?</p>
<p>B: My father, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. L: What is your name?</p>
<p>B: Peter Hurdle, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. L: How old are you?</p>
<p>B: Eight years old, next June.</p>
<p>Mr. L: How long have you been here?</p>
<p>B: Ever since six o’clock this morning.</p>
<p>Mr. L: Are you not hungry?</p>
<p>B: Yes, sir, but I shall go to dinner soon.</p>
<p>Mr. L: If you had a dime now, what would you do with it?</p>
<p>B: I don’t know, sir. I never had so much.</p>
<p>Mr. L: Have you no playthings?</p>
<p>B: Playthings? What are they?</p>
<p>Mr. L: Such things as ninepins, marbles, tops, and wooden horses.</p>
<p>B: No, sir. Tom and I play at football in winter, and I have a
jumping rope. I had a hoop, but it is broken.</p>
<p>Mr. L: Do you want nothing else?</p>
<p>B: I have hardly time to play with what I have. I have to drive the
cows, and to run on errands [5] , and to ride the horses to the fields,
and that is as good as play.</p>
<p>Mr. L: You could get apples and cakes, if you had money, you
know.</p>
<p>B: I can have apples at home. As for cake, I do not want that. My
mother makes me a pie now and then, which is as good.</p>
<p>Mr. L: Would you not like a knife to cut sticks?</p>
<p>B: I have one. Here it is. Brother Tom gave it to me.</p>
<p>Mr. L: Your shoes are full of holes. Don’t you want a new pair?</p>
<p>B: I have a better pair for Sundays.</p>
<p>Mr. L: But these let in water.</p>
<p>B: I do not mind that, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. L: Your hat is all torn, too.</p>
<p>B: I have a better one at home.</p>
<p>Mr. L: What do yon do when it rains?</p>
<p>B: If it rains very hard when I am in the field, I get under a tree
for shelter.</p>
<p>Mr. L: What do you do, if you are hungry before it is time to go
home?</p>
<p>B: I sometimes eat a raw [6] turnip.</p>
<p>Mr. L: But if there is none?</p>
<p>B: Then I do as well as I can without. I work on, and never think of
it.</p>
<p>Mr. L: Why, my little fellow, I am glad to see that you are so
contented. Were you ever at school?</p>
<p>B: No, sir. But father means to send me next winter.</p>
<p>Mr. L: You will want books then.</p>
<p>B: Yes, sir; each boy has a Spelling Book, a Reader, and a Testament
[7] .</p>
<p>Mr. L: Then I will give them to you. Tell your father so, and that it
is because you are an obliging, contented little boy.</p>
<p>B: I will, sir. Thank you.</p>
<p>Mr. L: Good by, Peter.</p>
<p>B: Good morning, sir.</p>

<p>男：
没有，先生。冬天的时候我和汤姆玩橄榄球，我还有一根跳绳，一个铁箍，不过铁箍坏掉了。</p>
<p>雷： 你不想要点别的东西吗？</p>
<p>男：
我几乎没有时间玩我拥有的东西。我必须赶牛、跑腿、把马骑到田野里放养，做这些事情跟玩耍一样有趣。</p>
<p>雷： 你知道吗，如果你有钱，就可以买到苹果和蛋糕。</p>
<p>男：
我家里就有苹果。至于说蛋糕，我不想要。我妈妈会时不时为我做馅饼，那也一样好吃。</p>

<p>雷：
那么到时我会给你这些东西。把我的话转告你的爸爸，并且告诉他，这是因为你是个乐于助人、知足常乐的小男孩。</p>

<p>LITTLE GUSTAVA</p>
<p>小古斯塔瓦</p>
<p>1．Little Gustava [1] sits in the sun,</p>
<p>Safe in the porch, and the little drops run</p>
<p>From the icicles [2] under the eaves [3] so fast,</p>
<p>For the bright spring sun shines warm at last,</p>
<p>And glad is little Gustava.</p>
<p>2．She wears a quaint [4] little scarlet cap,</p>
<p>And a little green bowl she holds in her lap,</p>
<p>Filled with bread and milk to the brim,</p>
<p>And a wreath of marigolds [5] round the rim:</p>
<p>“Ha! ha!” laughs little Gustava.</p>
<p>3．Up comes her little gray, coaxing cat,</p>
<p>With her little pink nose, and she mews, “What’s that ?”</p>
<p>Gustava feeds her,—she begs for more,</p>
<p>And a little brown hen walks in at the door:</p>
<p>“Good day!” cries little Gustava.</p>
<p>4．She scatters crumbs for the little brown hen,</p>
<p>There comes a rush and a flutter, and then</p>
<p>Down fly her little white doves so sweet,</p>
<p>With their snowy wings and their crimson feet:</p>
<p>“Welcome!” cries little Gustava.</p>
<p>5．So dainty and eager they pick up the crumbs.</p>
<p>But who is this through the doorway comes?</p>
<p>Little Scotch terrier, little dog Rags,</p>
<p>Looks in her face, and his funny tail wags:</p>
<p>“Ha! ha!” laughs little Gustava.</p>
<p>6．“You want some breakfast, too?” and down</p>
<p>She sets her bowl on the brick floor brown,</p>
<p>And little dog Rags drinks up her milk,</p>
<p>While she strokes his shaggy locks, like silk:</p>
<p>“Dear Rags!” says little Gustava.</p>
<p>7．Waiting without stood sparrow and crow,</p>
<p>Cooling their feet in the melting snow.</p>
<p>“Won’t you come in, good folk?” she cried,</p>
<p>But they were too bashful, and staid outside,</p>
<p>Though “Pray come in!” cried Gustava.</p>
<p>8．So the last she threw them, and knelt [6] on the mat,</p>
<p>With doves, and biddy [7] , and dog, and cat.</p>
<p>And her mother came to the open house door:</p>
<p>“Dear little daughter, I bring you some more,</p>
<p>My merry little Gustava.”</p>
<p>9．Kitty and terrier, biddy and doves,</p>
<p>All things harmless Gustava loves,</p>
<p>The shy, kind creatures ’t is joy to feed,</p>
<p>And, oh! her breakfast is sweet indeed</p>
<p>To happy little Gustava!</p>

<p>THE INSOLENT BOY</p>
<p>无礼的男孩</p>
<p>1．James Selton was one of the most insolent [1] boys in the village
where he lived. He would rarely [2] pass people in the street without
being guilty of some sort of abuse [3] .</p>
<p>2．If a person were well dressed he would cry out, “Dandy [4] !” If a
person’s clothes were dirty or torn, he would throw stones at him, and
annoy him in every way.</p>
<p>3．One afternoon, just as the school was dismissed [5] , a stranger
passed through the village. His dress was plain and somewhat old, but
neat and clean. He carried a cane in his hand, on the end of which was a
bundle, and he wore a broad-brimmed hat.</p>
<p>4．No sooner did James see the stranger, than he winked to his
playmates, and said, “Now for some fun!” He then silently went toward
the stranger from behind, and, knocking off his hat, ran away.</p>
<p>5．The man turned and saw him, but James was out of hearing before he
could speak. The stranger put on his hat, and went on his way. Again did
James approach; but this time, the man caught him by the arm, and held
him fast.</p>
<p>6．However, he contented himself with looking James a moment in the
face, and then pushed him from him. No sooner did the naughty [6] boy
find himself free again, than he began to pelt the stranger with dirt
and stones.</p>
<p>7．But he was much frightened when the “rowdy [7] ,” as he foolishly
called the man, was struck on the head by a brick, and badly hurt. All
the boys now ran away, and James skulked [8] across the fields to his
home.</p>
<p>8．As he drew near the house, his sister Caroline came out to meet
him, holding up a beautiful gold chain and some new books for him to
see.</p>
<p>9．She told James, as fast as she could talk, that their uncle [9] ,
who had been away several years, had come home, and was now in the
house; that he had brought beautiful presents for the whole family; that
he had left his carriage at the tavern [10] , a mile or two off, and
walked on foot, so as to surprise his brother, their father.</p>
<p>10．She said, that while he was coming through the village, some
wicked boys threw stones at him, and hit him just over the eye, and that
mother had bound up the wound. “But what makes you look so pale?” asked
Caroline, changing her tone.</p>
<p>11．The guilty boy told her that nothing was the matter with him; and
running into the house, he went upstairs into his chamber. Soon after,
he heard his father calling him to come down. Trembling from head to
foot, he obeyed. When he reached the parlor door, he stood, fearing to
enter.</p>
<p>12．His mother said, “James, why do you not come in? You are not
usually so bashful. See this beautiful watch, which your uncle has
brought for you.”</p>
<p>13．What a sense of shame did James now feel! Little Caroline seized
his arm, and pulled him into the room. But he hung down his head, and
covered his face with his hands.</p>
<p>14．His uncle went up to him, and kindly taking away his hands, said,
“James, will you not bid me welcome?” But quickly starting back, he
cried, “Brother, this is not your son. It is the boy who so shamefully
[11] insulted [12] me in the street!”</p>
<p>15．With surprise and grief did the good father and mother learn
this. His uncle was ready to forgive him, and forget the injury [13] .
But his father would never permit James to have the gold watch, nor the
beautiful books, which his uncle had brought for him.</p>
<p>16．The rest of the children were loaded with presents. James was
obliged to content himself with seeing them happy. He never forgot this
lesson so long as he lived. It cured him entirely [14] of his low and
insolent manners.</p>

<p>1．詹姆斯·塞尔顿是他们村子里最无礼的男孩之一。他在街上和人们迎面而过的时候，总会出言不逊。</p>
<p>2．如果有人穿得很讲究，他会大声地叫：“花花公子！”要是有人的衣服弄脏了或是被撕破了，他就会向人家扔石头，想尽办法激怒对方。</p>
<p>3．一天下午，刚刚放学的时候，有一个陌生人经过村庄。他衣着普通，显得有点旧，但干净整齐。这个人手里拿着一根拐杖，拐杖的末端有个包袱，头上戴着一顶宽边帽。</p>
<p>4．詹姆斯一看见这个陌生人，就向他的小伙伴们使了个眼色，说：“这下有好戏看了！”然后他默不作声地从后面向那个陌生人走去，把他的帽子打下来，接着就逃跑了。</p>
<p>5．那个人转过身看到了詹姆斯，可是他还没来得及说话，詹姆斯已经跑出去好远了。陌生人把帽子戴上，继续往前走。詹姆斯又走近他，不过这一次，陌生人抓住詹姆斯的手臂，紧紧地按住他。</p>
<p>6．然而，他只是盯着詹姆斯的脸看了一会儿，就把他往前一推，松开了他。顽皮的男孩一看到自己被放了，马上就开始向陌生人扔泥块和石头。</p>
<p>7．可是当这个被詹姆斯称为“流氓”的人被一块砖砸到头部，而且伤得很严重的时候，詹姆斯吓坏了。这时所有其他男孩都跑了，詹姆斯偷偷摸摸地越过田野，往家里走去。</p>
<p>8．当他靠近屋子的时候，妹妹卡洛琳跑出来迎接他，拿着一条漂亮的金项链和几本崭新的书给他看。</p>
<p>9．她用最快的语速告诉詹姆斯，他们几年前离开家的叔叔回来了，现在就在家里；他为全家人带了漂亮的礼物；为了给他的哥哥、他们的爸爸一个惊喜，他把马车留在了一两英里外的旅店里，走着来的。</p>
<p>10．她说，在叔叔穿过村庄到家里来的路上，有些顽皮的小男孩向他扔石头，把他的眼睛上方打伤了。妈妈帮他包扎了伤口。“哎，你的脸色怎么这么苍白啊？”卡洛琳变了声调问詹姆斯。</p>
<p>11．内疚的男孩告诉妹妹自己没事，然后就跑进屋子，上楼进了自己的房间。过了一会儿，他听到爸爸喊他下楼。他浑身颤抖着答应了。靠近客厅门口的时候，他站住了，不敢进去。</p>
<p>12．他的妈妈说：“詹姆斯，你怎么不进来？你平常可不是这么害羞的。看见这块漂亮的手表了吗？这是你们的叔叔带回来给你的。”</p>
<p>13．此时詹姆斯感到多么内疚啊！小卡洛琳抓住他的手臂，把他拉进了客厅。但是他低着头，用手捂着脸。</p>
<p>14．他的叔叔走进来，温和地把他的手拿开，说：“詹姆斯，你不欢迎我吗？”然而很快他就倒退了几步，喊了起来：“哥哥，这不是你的儿子！这是那个在街上无耻地侮辱我的小男孩！”</p>
<p>15．爸爸妈妈知道这件事后，又惊讶又伤心。他的叔叔愿意原谅他，不追究所受的伤。但是他的爸爸不允许詹姆斯拥有那只金表和那些漂亮的书，那些都是他的叔叔带回来给他的。</p>
<p>16．其他孩子都得到了很多礼物。詹姆斯只好心甘情愿地看着他们高兴。他有生之年都忘不了这个教训。这件事完全纠正了他粗俗无礼的行为举止。</p>

<p>WE ARE SEVEN</p>
<p>我们是七个</p>
<p>1．I met a little cottage girl:</p>
<p>She was eight years old, she said;</p>
<p>Her hair was thick with many a curl,</p>
<p>That clustered [1] round her head.</p>
<p>2．She had a rustic [2] , woodland air,</p>
<p>And she was wildly clad:</p>
<p>Her eyes were fair, and very fair;—</p>
<p>Her beauty made me glad.</p>
<p>3．“Sisters and brothers, little maid,</p>
<p>How many may you be?”</p>
<p>“How many? Seven in all,” she said,</p>
<p>And, wondering, looked at me.</p>
<p>4．“And where are they? I pray you tell.”</p>
<p>She answered, “Seven are we;</p>
<p>And two of us at Conway dwell,</p>
<p>And two are gone to sea.”</p>
<p>5．“Two of us in the churchyard lie,</p>
<p>My sister and my brother;</p>
<p>And, in the churchyard cottage, I</p>
<p>Dwell near them with my mother.”</p>
<p>6．“You say that two at Conway dwell,</p>
<p>And two are gone to sea,</p>
<p>Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell,</p>
<p>Sweet maid, how this may be.”</p>
<p>7．Then did the little maid reply,</p>
<p>“Seven boys and girls are we;</p>
<p>Two of us in the churchyard lie,</p>
<p>Beneath the churchyard tree.”</p>
<p>8．“You run about, my little maid,</p>
<p>Your limbs, they are alive;</p>
<p>If two are in the churchyard laid,</p>
<p>Then ye are only five.”</p>
<p>9．“Their graves are green, they may be seen,”</p>
<p>The little maid replied,</p>
<p>“Twelve steps or more from mother’s door,</p>
<p>And they are side by side.”</p>
<p>10．“My stockings there I often knit,</p>
<p>My kerchief [3] there I hem;</p>
<p>And there upon the ground I sit,</p>
<p>And sing a song to them.”</p>
<p>11．“And often after sunset, sir,</p>
<p>When it is light and fair,</p>
<p>I take my little porringer [4] ,</p>
<p>And eat my supper there.”</p>
<p>12．“The first that died was sister Jane;</p>
<p>In bed she moaning lay,</p>
<p>Till God released [5] her from her pain;</p>
<p>And then she went away.”</p>
<p>13．“So in the churchyard she was laid;</p>
<p>And, when the grass was dry,</p>
<p>Together round her grave we played,</p>
<p>My brother John and I.”</p>
<p>14．“And when the ground was white with snow,</p>
<p>And I could run and slide,</p>
<p>My brother John was forced to go,</p>
<p>And he lies by her side.”</p>
<p>15．“How many are you, then?” said I,</p>
<p>“If they two are in heaven?”</p>
<p>Quick was the little maid’s reply,</p>
<p>“O master! we are seven.”</p>
<p>16．“But they are dead; those two are dead!</p>
<p>Their spirits are in heaven!”</p>
<p>’T was throwing words away: for still</p>
<p>The little maid would have her will,</p>
<p>And said, “Nay, we are seven.”</p>

<p>1．我遇到一个乡村小姑娘，</p>
<p>她说，她今年八岁；</p>
<p>卷发盘在她的头上，</p>
<p>又浓又密的一堆。</p>
<p>2．她散发着一种乡野气息，</p>
<p>衣着也很朴实；</p>
<p>她的眼睛很美，非常美丽，</p>
<p>她的美令我欣喜。</p>
<p>3．“你的兄弟姐妹，小姑娘，</p>
<p>一共有几个？”</p>
<p>“有几个？一共是七个，”她说，</p>
<p>望着我，满脸好奇的神色。</p>
<p>4．“他们在哪里？我请你讲一讲。”</p>
<p>她回答说：“我们兄弟姐妹七个，</p>
<p>两个住在一个叫康威的地方，</p>
<p>两个出海当水手去了。”</p>
<p>5．“还有两个在教堂墓地长眠，</p>
<p>那是我的姐姐和哥哥；</p>
<p>妈妈和我也住在教堂旁边，</p>
<p>我们的小屋靠近他们两个。”</p>
<p>6．“你说有两个住在康威那里，</p>
<p>两个当水手去了海上，</p>
<p>可你们一共是七个！我请你，</p>
<p>告诉我这是怎么回事，好姑娘。”</p>
<p>7．小姑娘接着回答，</p>
<p>“我们是七个孩子，</p>
<p>两个躺在那棵树下，</p>
<p>就在教堂的墓地里。”</p>
<p>8．“你跑来又跑去，我的小姑娘，</p>
<p>你有灵活的手和腿；</p>
<p>既然有两个躺在墓地，</p>
<p>那你们只有五个才对。”</p>
<p>9．“看得见他们青青的坟墓，”</p>
<p>小姑娘说道，</p>
<p>“离家门口只有大概十二步，</p>
<p>他们在一起，紧紧依靠。”</p>
<p>10．“我经常在那里编织毛袜，</p>
<p>为我的手帕缝上褶边；</p>
<p>我常常在坟旁的地上坐下，</p>
<p>为他们唱歌消遣。”</p>
<p>11．“先生，常常在日落之后的傍晚，</p>
<p>当天还有些亮光，</p>
<p>我会带上我的小汤碗，</p>
<p>在那里把我的晚饭吃光。”</p>
<p>12．“简，我的姐姐最早进的坟墓，</p>
<p>她躺在床上呻吟不止，</p>
<p>直到上帝免除了她的痛苦，</p>
<p>她便从此远离苦海。”</p>
<p>13．“于是她在教堂的墓地躺下，</p>
<p>当墓上的草一干，</p>
<p>我们就围着她的坟墓玩耍，</p>
<p>就是我和我的哥哥约翰。”</p>
<p>14．“等到大地被白雪覆盖，</p>
<p>我可以乱跑乱滑地玩耍，</p>
<p>我的哥哥约翰被迫离开，</p>
<p>他就在简的身边躺下。”</p>
<p>15．“那你们还剩下几个？”我问，</p>
<p>“既然他们两个去了天国？”</p>
<p>小姑娘回答得很快：</p>
<p>“噢，先生，我们一共是七个没错。”</p>
<p>16．“ 可是他们死了，那两个已经死了啊！</p>
<p>他们的灵魂在天国里！”</p>
<p>我说这些话也是白搭，</p>
<p>“不，我们一共是七个。”小姑娘仍然坚持。</p>

<p>MARY’S DIME</p>
<p>玛丽的硬币</p>
<p>1．There! I have drawn the chairs into the right corners, and dusted
the room nicely. How cold papa and mamma will be when they return from
their long ride! It is not time to toast [1] the bread yet, and I am
tired of reading.</p>
<p>2．What shall I do? Somehow, I can’t help thinking about the pale
face of that little beggar girl all the time. I can see the glad light
filling her eyes, just as plain as I did when I laid the dime in her
little dirty hand.</p>
<p>3．How much I had thought of that dime, too! Grandpa gave it to me a
whole month ago, and I had kept it ever since in my red box upstairs;
but those sugar apples looked so beautiful, and were so cheap [2] —only
a dime apiece [3] —that I made up my mind to have one.</p>
<p>4．I can see her—the beggar girl, I mean—as she stood there in front
of the store, in her old hood [4] and faded [5] dress, looking at the
candies laid all in a row. I wonder what made me say, “Little girl, what
do you want?”</p>
<p>5．How she stared [6] at me, just as if nobody had spoken kindly to
her before. I guess she thought I was sorry for her, for she said, so
earnestly and sorrowfully [7] , “I was thinking how good one of those
gingerbread [8] rolls would taste. I haven’t had anything to eat
today.”</p>
<p>6．Now, I thought to myself, “Mary Williams, you have had a good
breakfast and a good dinner this day, and this poor girl has not had a
mouthful. You can give her your dime; she needs it a great deal more
than you do.”</p>
<p>7．I could not resist that little girl’s sorrowful, hungry look—so I
dropped the dime right into her hand, and, without waiting for her to
speak, walked straight away. I’m so glad I gave her the dime, if I did
have to go without the apple lying there in the window, and looking just
like a real one.</p>

<p>1．你瞧！我把椅子都拉到合适的角落里，把房间打扫得一尘不染。爸爸妈妈去长途旅行了，到家的时候该是多冷啊！现在还不是烤面包的时候，而我看书也已经看烦了。</p>
<p>2．我该做些什么呢？不知道为什么，我总是忍不住想起那个乞讨的小女孩。我面前浮现她眼里闪耀快乐光彩的画面，就像当我把一角硬币放到她脏兮兮的小手里时一样。</p>
<p>3．我也经常想起那个一角硬币啊！那是祖母一个月前给我的，从那以后我一直把它放在楼上的红盒子里。可是那些糖苹果看起来多漂亮啊，而且还那么便宜——只要一角钱一个——于是我下定决心要去买一个。</p>
<p>4．我能看到她——那个乞讨的女孩——当时她站在商店前面，戴着旧头巾，穿着褪了色的裙子，看着那些摆成一行的糖果，我不知道是什么促使我说：“小姑娘，你想要什么？”</p>
<p>5．她盯着我的神情显得多惊讶啊！就好像以前从来没有人和气地跟她说过话一样。我猜她觉得我为她感到难过，因为她语气急切而悲伤地答道：“我在想那些姜饼卷多好吃啊！今天我还没吃过东西。”</p>
<p>6．那个时候，我在心里对自己说：“玛丽·威廉斯，你今天吃了丰盛的早餐和午餐，这个可怜的小女孩却一口饭都没吃呢。你可以把你那个硬币给她，她比你更需要它。”</p>
<p>7．我无法抗拒那个小女孩悲伤、饥饿的神情——于是我把硬币塞到她的手里，不等她开口说话，就立刻走开了。我很高兴自己把硬币给了她。我离开了，没有带走橱窗里的那个糖苹果，尽管它看上去很像个真苹果。</p>

<p>MARY DOW</p>
<p>玛丽·道</p>
<p>1．“Come in, little stranger,” I said,</p>
<p>As she tapped at my half-open door;</p>
<p>While the blanket [1] , pinned over her head,</p>
<p>Just reached to the basket she bore.</p>
<p>2．A look full of innocence fell</p>
<p>From her modest and pretty blue eye,</p>
<p>As she said, “I have matches [2] to sell,</p>
<p>And hope you are willing to buy.”</p>
<p>3．“A penny [3] a bunch is the price,</p>
<p>I think you’ll not find it too much;</p>
<p>They are tied up so even and nice,</p>
<p>And ready to light with a touch.”</p>
<p>4．I asked, “What’s your name, little girl?”</p>
<p>“’T is Mary,” said she, “Mary Dow;”</p>
<p>And carelessly tossed off a curl,</p>
<p>That played on her delicate [4] brow.</p>
<p>5．“My father was lost on the deep;</p>
<p>The ship never got to the shore;</p>
<p>And mother is sad, and will weep,</p>
<p>To hear the wind blow and sea roar.”</p>
<p>6．“She sits there at home, without food,</p>
<p>Beside our poor, sick Willy’s bed;</p>
<p>She paid all her money for wood,</p>
<p>And so I sell matches for bread.”</p>
<p>7．“I’d go to the yard and get chips,</p>
<p>But then it would make me too sad</p>
<p>To see the men building the ships,</p>
<p>And think they had made one so bad.”</p>
<p>8．“But God, I am sure, who can take</p>
<p>Such fatherly care of a bird,</p>
<p>Will never forget nor forsake [5]</p>
<p>The children who trust in his word.”</p>
<p>9．“And now, if I only can sell</p>
<p>The matches I brought out today,</p>
<p>I think I shall do very well,</p>
<p>And we shall rejoice at the pay.”</p>
<p>10．“Fly home, little bird,” then I thought,</p>
<p>“Fly home, full of joy, to your nest;”</p>
<p>For I took all the matches she brought,</p>
<p>And Mary may tell you the rest.</p>

<p>THE LITTLE LOAF</p>
<p>小块面包</p>
<p>1．Once when there was a famine [1] , a rich baker sent for twenty of
the poorest children in the town, and said to them, “In this basket
there is a loaf [2] for each of you. Take it, and come back to me every
day at this hour till God sends us better times.”</p>
<p>2．The hungry children gathered eagerly about the basket, and
quarreled for the bread, because each wished to have the largest loaf.
At last they went away without even thanking the good gentleman.</p>
<p>3．But Gretchen [3] , a poorly-dressed little girl, did not quarrel
or struggle with the rest, but remained [4] standing modestly in the
distance [5] . When the ill-behaved [6] girls had left, she took the
smallest loaf, which alone was left in the basket, kissed the
gentleman’s hand, and went home.</p>
<p>4．The next day the children were as ill-behaved as before, and poor,
timid Gretchen received a loaf scarcely half the size of the one she got
the first day. When she came home, and her mother cut the loaf open,
many new, shining pieces of silver fell out of it.</p>
<p>5．Her mother was very much alarmed, and said, “Take the money back
to the good gentleman at once, for it must have got into the dough by
accident [7] . Be quick, Gretchen! be quick!”</p>
<p>6．But when the little girl gave the rich man her mother’s message
[8] , he said, “No, no, my child, it was no mistake. I had the silver
pieces put into the smallest loaf to reward you. Always be as contented,
peaceable [9] , and grateful as you now are. Go home now, and tell your
mother that the money is your own.”</p>

<p>1．从前，发生了一场饥荒。有一位富有的面包师让人叫来了城里最穷苦的二十个小孩，对他们说：“你们每个人都可以从这个篮子里拿一条面包。拿去吧，以后每天这个时候回到我这里来，直到上帝赐给我们好转的日子为止。”</p>
<p>2．饥饿的孩子们急忙围拢在篮子周围，他们为了面包互相争吵，因为每个人都希望拿到最大的那条面包。最后，他们连“谢谢”也没对那位善良的先生说一句就走了。</p>
<p>3．然而，格雷琴，一个衣衫褴褛的小姑娘，并没有和其他人争抢，而是一直谦卑地站在远处。当那些举止失礼的孩子们离去之后，她拿出篮子里仅剩的最小的那条面包，亲吻面包师先生的手表示感谢，然后回家了。</p>
<p>4．第二天，那些孩子们和第一天一样没礼貌，而穷苦、羞怯的格雷琴得到了更小的面包，几乎只有前一天那条面包的一半大。当她回到家，妈妈把面包条切开的时候，许多崭新的、闪闪发亮的银币掉了出来。</p>
<p>5．她的妈妈吓呆了，说：“马上把这些钱拿回去还给那位仁慈的先生，这些钱肯定是意外掉进面团里的。赶快去，格雷琴，赶快！”</p>
<p>6．但是，当小姑娘把妈妈说的话告诉那位有钱人的时候，先生说：“不，不，我的孩子，那没弄错。我让人把这些银币放进最小的面包条里，是为了奖励你。希望你永远像现在这样，一直都有知足、平和、感恩的心。现在回家去吧，告诉妈妈，这些钱已经是你们自己的了。”</p>

<p>SUSIE AND ROVER</p>
<p>苏茜和罗孚</p>
<p>1．“Mamma,” said Susie Dean, one summer’s morning, “may I go to the
woods, and pick berries?”</p>
<p>2．“Yes,” replied Mrs. Dean, “but you must take Rover with you.”</p>
<p>3．Susie brought her little basket, and her mother put up a nice
lunch for her. She tied down the cover, and fastened a tin cup to
it.</p>
<p>4．The little girl called Rover—a great Newfoundland dog—and gave him
a tin pail to carry. “If I bring it home full, mamma,” she said, “won’t
you make some berry cakes for tea?”</p>
<p>5．Away she tripped, singing as she went down the lane and across the
pasture. When she got to the woods, she put her dinner basket down
beside a tree, and began to pick berries.</p>
<p>6．Rover ran about, chasing a squirrel or a rabbit now and then, but
never straying far from Susie.</p>
<p>7．The tin pail was not a very small one. By the time it was two
thirds full, Susie began to feel hungry, and thought she would eat her
lunch.</p>
<p>8．Rover came and took his place at her side as soon as she began to
eat. Did she not give him some of the lunch? No, she was in a selfish
[1] mood [2] , and did no such thing.</p>
<p>9．“There, Rover, run away! there’s a good dog,” she said; but Rover
staid near her, watching her steadily [3] with his clear brown eyes.</p>
<p>10．The meat he wanted so much, was soon eaten up; and all he got of
the nice dinner, was a small crust of gingerbread that Susie threw
away.</p>
<p>11．After dinner, Susie played a while by the brook. She threw sticks
into the water, and Rover swam in and brought them back. Then she began
to pick berries again.</p>
<p>12．She did not enjoy the afternoon as she did the morning. The
sunshine was as bright, the berries were as sweet and plentiful [4] ,
and she was neither [5] tired nor hungry.</p>
<p>13．But good, faithful Rover was hungry, and she had not given him
even one piece of meat. She tried to forget how selfish she had been;
but she could not do so, and quite early she started for home.</p>
<p>14．When she was nearly out of the woods, a rustling in the
underbrush [6] attracted [7] her attention [8] . “I wonder if that is a
bird or a squirrel,” said she to herself. “If I can catch it, how glad I
shall be!”</p>
<p>15．She tried to make her way quietly through the underbrush; but
what was her terror [9] when she saw a large snake coiled up before her,
prepared for a spring!</p>
<p>16．She was so much frightened that she could not move; but brave
Rover saw the snake, and, springing forward, seized it by the neck and
killed it.</p>
<p>17．When the faithful dog came and rubbed his head against her hand,
Susie put her arms around his neck, and burst into tears. “O Rover,” she
cried, “you dear, good dog! How sorry I am that I was so selfish!”</p>
<p>18．Rover understood the tone of her voice, if he did not understand
her words, and capered [10] about in great glee, barking all the time.
You may be sure that he had a plentiful supper that evening.</p>
<p>19．Susie never forgot the lesson of that day. She soon learned to be
on her guard against a selfish spirit, and became a happier and more
lovable little girl.</p>

<p>1．“妈妈，”一个夏日的早晨，苏茜·迪恩说，“我可不可以到树林里去采浆果？”</p>
<p>2．“可以，”迪恩太太回答，“但是你必须带着罗孚一起去。”</p>
<p>3．苏茜带上她的小篮子，妈妈为她准备了美味的午餐。她把盖子绑紧，再在上面系上一个杯子。</p>
<p>4．小女孩呼唤罗孚——一条很棒的纽芬兰犬——再给它一个锡桶叼着。“要是我装满这个桶带回家来，妈妈，”她说，“你会不会做一些浆果蛋糕在喝茶的时候吃呢？”</p>
<p>5．她轻快地走了出去，唱着歌儿，顺着小路，穿过了牧场。到了树林里，她把装着午餐的篮子放在一棵树下，开始采起浆果来。</p>
<p>6．罗孚跑来跑去，不时追赶松鼠或野兔，但绝对不会离开苏茜太远。</p>
<p>7．锡桶并不小。到浆果装满了桶的三分之二的时候，苏茜开始觉得饿了，想起来该吃午饭了。</p>
<p>8．苏茜开始吃饭时，罗孚马上跑了过来，在她身边找个位置蹲好。不给它分一点儿吗？苏茜想法有些自私，没有给罗孚食物。</p>
<p>9．“罗孚，去那边，快走开！乖。”她说。可是罗孚在她身边一动也不动，用清澈的褐色眼睛默默地注视着她。</p>
<p>10．它多想要那块肉啊，可是很快就被苏茜吃掉了；这顿美味的午餐它唯一得到的，就是苏茜扔掉的一小块姜饼皮。</p>
<p>11．吃完以后，苏茜在小河边玩了一会儿。她把棍子扔到水里，罗孚游出去把它叼回来。之后她又开始采浆果了。</p>
<p>12．下午她并没有像早上那么开心。阳光一样明亮，浆果也一样多而甜美。她并不累，也不饿。</p>
<p>13．然而又乖又忠诚的罗孚却饿着肚子，苏茜连一小片肉也没有给它。苏茜想忘掉自己是多么自私，可是却做不到。时间还早，可是她决定提前回家。</p>
<p>14．当她快要走出树林的时候，灌木丛里传来沙沙作响的声音，引起了她的注意。“我想知道那是只小鸟还是松鼠，”她心里想，“如果我能抓住它，我该多高兴啊！”</p>
<p>15．她努力让自己不发出任何声音，悄悄爬过灌木丛。当她看见一条大蛇盘踞在她面前的时候，简直吓呆了。那条蛇卷成一圈，随时准备起来向她扑去！</p>
<p>16．她害怕得无法动弹。然而勇敢的罗孚一看见这条蛇，就跳上前去，咬住蛇的脖子，把它咬死了。</p>
<p>17．忠心的狗跑回来，头在苏茜的手上蹭来蹭去。苏茜双臂抱住它的脖子，禁不住大哭起来。“噢，罗孚，”她呼喊着，“亲爱的乖狗！我好后悔，吃午饭的时候我那么自私！”</p>
<p>18．罗孚即便听不懂苏茜说的话，也能理解她的声调和语气。它快乐地跳来跳去，不停地吠叫。你也许猜到了，罗孚那天的晚餐非常丰盛。</p>
<p>19．苏茜从没忘记那天的教训。她很快学会了随时警惕自私心理的出现，变成了一个更快乐、更可爱的小女孩。</p>

<p>NO CROWN FOR ME</p>
<p>不要给我花冠</p>
<p>1．“Will you come with us, Susan?” cried several little girls to a
schoolmate. “We are going to the woods; do come, too.”</p>
<p>2．“I should like to go with you very much,” replied Susan, with a
sigh; “but I can not finish the task grandmother set me to do.”</p>
<p>3．“How tiresome [1] it must be to stay at home to work on a
holiday!” said one of the girls, with a toss of her head. “Susan’s
grandmother is too strict.”</p>
<p>4．Susan heard this remark, and, as she bent her head over her task,
she wiped away a tear, and thought of the pleasant afternoon the girls
would spend gathering wild flowers in the woods.</p>
<p>5．Soon she said to herself, “What harm can there be in moving the
mark grandmother put in the stocking? The woods must be very beautiful
today, and how I should like to be in them!”</p>
<p>6．“Grandmother,” said she, a few minutes afterwards, “I am ready,
now.” “What, so soon, Susan?” Her grandmother took the work, and looked
at it very closely.</p>
<p>7．“True, Susan,” said she, laying great stress [2] on each
word;“true, I count twenty turns from the mark; and, as you have never
deceived me, you may go and amuse yourself as you like the rest of the
day.”</p>
<p>8．Susan’s cheeks were scarlet, and she did not say, “Thank you.” As
she left the cottage, she walked slowly away, not singing as usual.</p>
<p>9．“Why, here is Susan!” the girls cried, when she joined their
company [3] ; “but what is the matter? Why have you left your dear, old
grandmother?” they tauntingly [4] added.</p>
<p>10．“There is nothing the matter.” As Susan repeated these words, she
felt that she was trying to deceive herself. She had acted a lie. At the
same time she remembered her grandmother’s words,“You have never
deceived me.”</p>
<p>11．“Yes, I have deceived her,” said she to herself. “If she knew
all, she would never trust me again.”</p>
<p>12．When the little party had reached an open space in the woods, her
companions ran about enjoying themselves; but Susan sat on the grass,
wishing she were at home confessing [5] her fault [6] .</p>
<p>13．After a while Rose cried out, “Let us make a crown of violets,
and put it on the head of the best girl here.”</p>
<p>14．“It will be easy enough to make the crown, but not so easy to
decide who is to wear it,” said Julia.</p>
<p>15．“Why, Susan is to wear it, of course,” said Rose: “is she not
said to be the best girl in school and the most obedient at home?”</p>
<p>16．“Yes, yes; the crown shall be for Susan,” cried the other girls,
and they began to make the crown. It was soon finished.</p>
<p>17．“Now, Susan,” said Rose, “put it on in a very dignified [7] way,
for you are to be our queen.”</p>
<p>18．As these words were spoken, the crown was placed on her head. In
a moment she snatched it off, and threw it on the ground, saying, “No
crown for me; I do not deserve it.”</p>
<p>19．The girls looked at her with surprise. “I have deceived my
grandmother,” said she, while tears flowed down her cheeks. “I altered
[8] the mark she put in the stocking, that I might join you in the
woods.”</p>
<p>20．“Do you call that wicked?” asked one of the girls.</p>
<p>“I am quite sure it is; and I have been miserable [9] all the time I
have been here.”</p>
<p>21．Susan now ran home, and as soon as she got there she said, with a
beating heart, “O grandmother! I deserve to be punished, for I altered
the mark you put in the stocking. Do forgive me; I am very sorry and
unhappy.”</p>
<p>22．“Susan,” said her grandmother, “I knew it all the time; but I let
you go out, hoping that your own conscience would tell you of your sin.
I am so glad that you have confessed your fault and your sorrow.”</p>
<p>23．“When shall I be your own little girl again?” “Now,” was the
quick reply, and Susan’s grandmother kissed her forehead [10] .</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-230">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．“苏珊，你一起来吗？”几个小女孩向她们的一位同学呼喊，“我们要去树林里，你也来吧！”</p>
<p>2．“我很想跟你们一起去，”苏珊叹了一口气，回答道，“可是我还没完成奶奶交给我的任务。”</p>
<p>3．“放假还待在家里干活儿多没劲啊！”其中一个女孩晃着脑袋说，“苏珊的奶奶太严厉了。”</p>
<p>4．苏珊听到了这句评语，当她转身低头继续干活时，拭去了眼中的一滴泪水，想象着那些女孩们将在树林里采摘野花，度过一个愉快的下午。</p>
<p>5．很快她对自己说：“把奶奶放在袜子里的标志挪动一下又能有什么害处呢？今天树林里一定很美，而我是多么想和她们一起啊！”</p>
<p>6．“奶奶，”过了几分钟之后，她说，“我现在已经做好了。”“是吗，苏珊，这么快呀？”奶奶接过苏珊的作品，仔细查看。</p>
<p>7．“没错，苏珊，”奶奶每一个字都咬得很重地说，“没错，我数过了，标志上有二十个圈；而且，因为你从来没有欺骗过我，今天剩下的时间你可以去做你喜欢做的事情了。”</p>
<p>8．苏珊的脸颊红了起来，她也没说“谢谢”。在离开小屋的时候，她走得很慢，没有像平常那样唱着歌走开。</p>
<p>9．“咦，苏珊来了！”苏珊加入女孩们的时候，她们高声喊了起来。“可这是怎么回事呢？你为什么离开你亲爱的奶奶呢？”她们略带责备地问。</p>
<p>10．“没什么事啊。”当苏珊重复这句话的时候，她觉得自己是在试图骗自己。她已经撒了一个谎。同时记起了奶奶跟她说的话：“你从来没有骗过我。”</p>
<p>11．“我骗了她，”她在心里对自己说，“如果奶奶知道真相，肯定再也不会信任我了。”</p>
<p>12．她们的小聚会转移到树林里的一块空地上，同伴们跑来跑去非常开心，然而苏珊却坐在草地上，希望自己是在家里，正在承认自己的错误。</p>
<p>13．过了一会儿，罗斯高声说：“我们用紫罗兰编一个花冠吧，把它戴在这里最好的女孩的头上。”</p>
<p>14．“编花冠不难，可是要决定谁可以戴上它就不容易了。”茱莉亚说。</p>
<p>15．“谁说的，当然是苏珊戴上它，”罗斯说，“难道她不是公认的在学校里学习最好、在家里最听话的女孩吗？”</p>
<p>16．“对对对，花冠应该属于苏珊。”其他女孩大声说。她们开始编织花冠，很快就编好了。</p>
<p>17．“来，苏珊，”罗斯说，“高贵地戴上这个花冠吧，因为你就像我们的皇后。”</p>
<p>18．话音刚落，花冠就戴在了苏珊的头上。过了一会儿，她突然把花冠扯了下来，扔在地上，说：“不要给我花冠，我不配戴它。”</p>
<p>19．女孩们惊讶地看着她。“我欺骗了我的奶奶，”苏珊说，泪水顺着她的脸颊流了下来。“我挪用了她放在袜子里的标志，所以我才能到树林里来和你们一起玩。”</p>
<p>20．“你认为这是坏事？”一个女孩问道。</p>
<p>“我很肯定这是坏事，我待在这里一直感到很难受。”</p>
<p>21．此时，苏珊往家的方向飞奔起来。一回到家，心还“怦怦”跳着，“噢，奶奶！我应该受罚，因为我挪动了你放在袜子里的标志。请您千万要原谅我，我一直感到歉疚和不开心。”</p>
<p>22．“苏珊，”奶奶开口说，“我从一开始就知道了，但我还是让你出去玩，希望你的良心会告诉你自己的过错。我很高兴你承认了自己的错误，并且为自己撒谎感到伤心。”</p>
<p>23．“我什么时候可以再成为你亲爱的小孙女呢？”“现在就是！”奶奶马上回答她，并且在苏珊的前额印上一个吻。</p>

<p>Our captain wheeled the van [7] ;</p>

<p>And brightly shone his new tin sword;</p>
<p>A paper cap he wore.</p>
<p>8．He led us up the steep hillside,</p>
<p>Against the western wind,</p>
<p>While the cockerel [11] plume that decked his head</p>
<p>Streamed bravely out behind.</p>
<p>9．We shouldered arms, we carried arms,</p>
<p>We charged [12] the bayonet;</p>
<p>And woe unto the mullein [13] stalk</p>
<p>That in our course we met!</p>
<p>10．At two o’clock the roll we called,</p>
<p>And till the close of day,</p>
<p>With fearless hearts, though tired limbs,</p>
<p>We fought the mimic fray [14] ,—</p>
<p>Till the supper bell, from out the dell,</p>
<p>Bade us march, march away.</p>

<p>HOW WILLIE GOT OUT OF THE SHAFT</p>
<p>威利是怎样逃出枯井的</p>
<p>1．Willie’s aunt sent him for a birthday [1] present a little writing
book. There was a place in the book for a pencil. Willie thought a great
deal of this little book, and always kept it in his pocket.</p>
<p>2．One day, his mother was very busy, and he called his dog, and
said, “Come, Caper, let us have a play.”</p>
<p>3．When Willie’s mother missed him, she went to the door and looked
out, and could not see him anywhere; but she knew that Caper was with
him, and thought they would come back before long.</p>
<p>4．She waited an hour, and still they did not come. When she came to
the gate by the road, she met Mr. Lee, and told him how long Willie had
been gone. Mr. Lee thought he must have gone to sleep under the trees.
So they went to all the trees under which Willie was in the habit of
playing, but he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>5．By this time the sun had gone down. The news that Willie was lost
soon spread over the neighborhood [2] , and all the men and women [3]
turned out to hunt. They hunted all night.</p>
<p>6．The next morning the neighbors were gathered round, and all were
trying to think what to do next, when Caper came bounding into the room.
There was a string tied round his neck, and a bit of paper tied to
it.</p>
<p>7．Willie’s father, Mr. Lee, took the paper, and saw that it was a
letter from Willie. He read it aloud. It said, “O father! come to me. I
am in the big hole in the pasture.”</p>
<p>8．Everybody ran at once to the far corner of the pasture; and there
was Willie, alive and well, in the shaft [4] . Oh, how glad he was when
his father caught him in his arms, and lifted him out!</p>
<p>9．Now I will tell you how Willie came to be in the shaft. He and
Caper went to the pasture field, and came to the edge of the shaft and
sat down. In bending over to see how deep it was, he lost his balance,
and fell in. He tried very hard to get out, but could not.</p>
<p>10．When the good little dog saw that his master was in the shaft, he
would not leave him, but ran round and round, reaching down and trying
to pull him out. But while Caper was pulling Willie by the coat sleeves,
a piece of sod gave way under his feet, and he fell in too.</p>
<p>11．Willie called for his father and mother as loud as he could call;
but he was so far away from the house that no one could hear him.</p>
<p>12．He cried and called till it was dark, and then he lay down on the
ground, and Caper lay down close beside him. It was not long before
Willie cried himself to sleep.</p>
<p>13．When he awoke it was morning, and he began to think of a way to
get out. The little writing book that his aunt had given him, was in his
pocket. He took it out, and, after a good deal of trouble, wrote the
letter to his father.</p>
<p>14．Then he tore the leaf out, and took a string out of his pocket,
and tied it round Caper’s neck, and tied the letter to the string. Then
he lifted the dog up, and helped him out, and said to him, “Go home,
Caper, go home!” The little dog scampered [5] away, and was soon at
home.</p>

<p>1．威利的阿姨送了他一个笔记本作为生日礼物。本子上有个地方插着铅笔。威利非常喜欢这个小本子，总是把它放在口袋里。</p>
<p>2．有一天，威利的妈妈很忙。威利把他的小狗叫过来：“凯普过来，咱们玩个游戏。”</p>
<p>3．当威利的妈妈想起他来时，她走到门口四处张望，却哪儿也没有看到威利的身影。妈妈知道小狗凯普和威利在一起，心想他们不久之后就会回家来了。</p>
<p>4．等了一个小时，他们还是没有回来。她走到路边的大门口，遇到了丈夫李先生，于是告诉他已经很长时间没见到威利了。李先生猜想威利一定是在树荫下睡着了。于是他们到威利平常习惯去玩耍的地方寻找，然而在所有的树底下，都没有找到小威利。</p>
<p>5．到了太阳下山的时候，“威利不见了”的消息已经迅速传开。邻居们男男女女都到外面帮忙寻找，足足找了一整夜。</p>
<p>6．第二天早晨，邻居们聚集在房间里，都在想下一步应该怎么做。就在这个时候，小狗凯普突然跑了进来。在凯普的脖子上系着一根绳子，绑着一张小纸条。</p>
<p>7．威利的爸爸李先生取下了纸条，发现那是威利写的一封信。他大声地读出来，信上是这样写的：“噢，爸爸！快来救我！我在牧场的那个大坑里。”</p>
<p>8．所有人马上跑到牧场那个遥远的角落，威利果然在那个枯井里，安然无恙。噢，当爸爸用双臂抱起威利，把他举起来送到井外的那一刻，威利多么高兴啊！</p>
<p>9．好了，现在我来告诉你威利是怎么掉进枯井里去的。他和凯普到牧场上玩耍，来到枯井的边缘坐了下来。在弯腰看井有多深的时候，威利失去平衡掉了下去。他非常努力地往上爬，却怎么也爬不上来。</p>
<p>10．乖小狗看见主人掉进了井里，一直都没离开。它绕着井口跑来跑去，还往下探身子试图把威利拉上来。可是就在凯普咬着威利外套的袖子往上拉的时候，它脚下的一块草皮松了，于是凯普也掉进了井里。</p>
<p>11．威利用尽最大的声音使劲喊爸爸妈妈，可是他离家太远了，根本没有人能听见他的呼喊。</p>
<p>12．他又哭又喊直到天黑，然后躺倒在地上，凯普也在他身边躺了下来。威利哭着哭着，没多久就睡着了。</p>
<p>13．到威利醒过来的时候已经天亮了，他开始想办法离开这个地方。他想起了口袋里阿姨送给他的小本子。威利把小本子掏了出来，费了半天的劲儿，写了那封给爸爸的信。</p>
<p>14．写完之后，威利撕下了那一页纸，从口袋里拿出一根绳子，绑在凯普的脖子上，再把信紧紧绑在绳子上。然后，他把小狗举起来，帮助它爬出了枯井，对它说：“回家，凯普，回家！”小狗马上飞奔起来，很快就到家了。</p>

<p>THE PERT CHICKEN</p>
<p>无礼的小公鸡</p>
<p>1．There was once a pretty chicken;</p>
<p>But his friends were very few,</p>
<p>For he thought that there was nothing</p>
<p>In the world but what he knew:</p>
<p>So he always, in the farmyard [1] ,</p>
<p>Had a very forward [2] way,</p>
<p>Telling all the hens and turkeys [3]</p>
<p>What they ought to do and say.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Goose,” he said, “I wonder</p>
<p>That your goslings [4] you should let</p>
<p>Go out paddling [5] in the water;</p>
<p>It will kill them to get wet.”</p>
<p>2．“I wish, my old Aunt Dorking [6] ,”</p>
<p>He began to her, one day,</p>
<p>“That you wouldn’t sit all summer</p>
<p>In your nest upon the hay.</p>
<p>Won’t you come out to the meadow,</p>
<p>Where the grass with seeds is filled?”</p>
<p>“If I should,” said Mrs. Dorking,</p>
<p>“Then my eggs would all get chilled.”</p>

<p>“And no matter if they do;</p>
<p>Eggs are really good for nothing;</p>
<p>What’s an egg to me or you?”</p>
<p>3．“What’s an egg!” said Mrs. Dorking,</p>

<p>INDIAN CORN</p>
<p>印第安玉米</p>
<p>1．Few plants are more useful to man than Indian corn, or maize. No
grain, except rice, is used to so great an extent as an article [1] of
food. In some countries corn is almost the only food eaten by the
people.</p>
<p>2．Do you know why it is called Indian corn? It is because the
American Indians were the first corn growers. Columbus found this grain
widely cultivated [2] by them when he discovered the New World. They
pounded it in rude, stone bowls, and thus made a coarse flour, which
they mixed with water and baked.</p>
<p>3．Indian corn is now the leading crop in the United States. In
whatever part of this land we live, we see corn growing every year in
its proper season. Yet how few can tell the most simple and important
[3] facts about its planting and its growth!</p>
<p>4．Corn, to do well, must have a rich soil and a warm climate. It is
a tender plant, and is easily injured by cold weather. The seed corn
does not sprout, but rots, if the ground is cold and wet.</p>
<p>5．To prepare land properly for planting corn, the soil is made fine
by plowing, and furrows [4] are run across the field four feet apart
each way. At every point where these furrows cross, the farmer drops
from four to seven grains of seed corn. These are then covered with
about two inches of earth, and thus form “hills” of corn.</p>
<p>6．In favorable [5] weather, the tender blades push through the
ground in ten days or two weeks; then the stalks mount up rapidly, and
the long, streamer [6] -like leaves unfold gracefully from day to day.
Corn must be carefully cultivated while the plants are small. After they
begin to shade the ground, they need but little hoeing or plowing.</p>
<p>7．The moisture [7] and earthy matter, drawn through the roots,
become sap. This passes through the stalk, and enters the leaves. There
a great change takes place which results [8] in the starting of the ears
and the growth of the grain.</p>
<p>8．The maize plant bears two kinds of flowers,—male and female. The
two are widely separated [9] . The male flowers are on the tassel; the
fine silk threads which surround the ear, and peep out from the end of
the husks, are the female flowers.</p>
<p>9．Each grain on the cob is the startingpoint for a thread of silk;
and, unless the thread receives some particle [10] of the dust which
falls from the tassel flowers, the kernel with which it is connected
will not grow.</p>
<p>10．The many uses of Indian corn and its products are worthy of note.
The green stalks and leaves make excellent [11] fodder [12] for cattle.
The ripe grain is used all over the earth as food for horses, pigs, and
poultry [13] . Nothing is better for fattening stock.</p>
<p>11．Green corn, or “roasting ears,” hulled corn and hominy, New
England hasty pudding, and succotash [14] are favorite dishes with many
persons. Then there are parched corn and pop corn—the delight of long
winter evenings.</p>
<p>12．Cornstarch is an important article of commerce [15] . Sirup and
sugar are made from the juice of the stalk, and oil and alcohol [16]
from the ripened grain. Corn husks are largely used for filling
mattresses [17] , and are braided [18] into mats, baskets, and other
useful articles.</p>
<p>13．Thus it will be seen how varied are the uses of Indian corn. And
besides being so useful, the plant is very beautiful. The sight of a
large cornfield in the latter part of summer, with all its green banners
waving and its tasseled plumes nodding, is one to admire, and not to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>1．很少有别的植物像印第安玉米（也叫玉蜀黍）那么有用。除了大米以外，没有哪一种农作物像玉米这样被如此广泛地用作粮食。在某些国家，玉米几乎是人们唯一的食物。</p>
<p>2．你知道印第安玉米这个称呼是怎么来的吗？那是因为美洲的印第安人是最早种植玉米的人。哥伦布发现新大陆的时候，也发现了印第安人大面积地种植这种农作物。他们把玉米放在粗糙的石碗里捣碎，做成粗粝的玉米面，和上水就可以烘烤成玉米饼了。</p>
<p>3．印第安玉米是美国目前最主要的农作物。在我们生活的这片土地上，无论哪个地区，每年在相应的季节，我们都可以看到玉米茁壮生长。但是，关于玉米的种植和生长，又有多少人能简明扼要地讲出来呢？</p>
<p>4．要让玉米生长得好，必须要有肥沃的土壤和温暖的气候。这种柔弱的植物很容易被寒冷天气摧毁。如果土地又冷又湿，玉米的种子就不会发芽，而会腐烂。</p>
<p>5．为种植玉米而准备的土地，必须通过翻耕使土壤适于种植，一块地分成许多小块，任一方向每四英尺都要以土沟分隔。在土沟纵横交叉之处，农夫撒下四至七粒玉米种子，埋在大约两英寸的土壤下面，这样就形成了“玉米堆”。</p>
<p>6．只要天气适宜，十天到两周之后，柔弱的种子就会扎根在土壤里，很快枝茎破土而出，越长越高。一天一天过去，丝带一样的叶子也优雅地舒展开来。在玉米还是幼苗的时候，必须细心照料。然而当它们长高，盖住了土地之后，就几乎不再需要耕作了。</p>
<p>7．玉米的根从土壤里吸取水分和养分，成为树液，经由茎部传输到叶子。这为植物带来巨大的变化，因此得以抽穗，最终长出颗粒。</p>
<p>8．玉米开的花有两种——雄花和雌花。两种花很不一样，雄花呈穗状，而雌花则是丝一样的细线，围绕着包谷生长，并在包皮的末端隐约露出来。</p>
<p>9．玉米穗轴上的每一个颗粒都是一束丝状雌花的起点，只有花束获得来自于穗状雄花的微粒，它所连接的内核才可以成长。</p>
<p>10．印第安玉米及其产品的广泛用途值得详细注解：绿色的玉米茎和叶子是喂牛的好饲料。成熟的玉米粒在全世界都被广泛用作饲料，喂养马、猪、家禽等。它还是最好的积肥用料。</p>
<p>11．嫩玉米、烤熟或煮熟的玉米、去皮玉米、玉米粥、新英格兰玉米糊或是豆煮玉米是许多人的最爱。还有烘烤玉米片和爆米花，在漫漫冬夜里为人们带来欢乐。</p>
<p>12．玉米淀粉是一种重要的商品。玉米茎的汁液是提炼糖和糖浆的原料。成熟的玉米粒是制油和酒精的原料。玉米的包皮用途也很广泛，它可以是床垫的填充物，也可以被编织成为各种垫子、篮子和其他用品。</p>
<p>13．由此可见，印第安玉米全身都是宝。它不但用途多样，而且还很漂亮。盛夏时节，一望无际的玉米地，绿色的叶子像旗帜一样迎风飞舞，抽穗的包谷随风点头，这是多么赏心悦目而又令人难忘的景色啊！</p>

<p>THE SNOWBIRD’S SONG</p>
<p>雪鸟之歌</p>
<p>1．The ground was all covered with snow one day,</p>

<p>And merrily singing his chick-a-de-dee [1] .</p>
<p>2．He had not been singing that tune very long</p>
<p>Ere Emily heard him, so loud was his song:</p>
<p>“O sister, look out of the window!” said she;</p>
<p>“Here’s a dear little bird singing chick-a-de-dee.”</p>
<p>3．“Poor fellow! he walks in the snow and the sleet,</p>
<p>And has neither stockings nor shoes on his feet:</p>
<p>I wonder what makes him so full of his glee;</p>
<p>He’s all the time singing his chick-a-de-dee.”</p>
<p>4．“If I were a barefooted snowbird, I know,</p>
<p>I would not stay out in the cold and the snow;</p>
<p>I pity him so! oh, how cold he must be!</p>
<p>And yet he keeps singing his chick-a-de-dee.”</p>
<p>5．“O mother; do get him some stockings, and shoes,</p>
<p>And a nice little frock, and a hat if he choose:</p>
<p>I wish he’d come into the parlor, and see</p>
<p>How warm we would make him, poor chick-a-de-dee!”</p>
<p>6．The bird had flown down for some sweet crumbs of bread,</p>
<p>And heard every word little Emily said:</p>
<p>“What a figure [2] I’d make in that dress” thought he,</p>
<p>And laughed as he warbled his chick-a-de-dee.</p>
<p>7．“I am grateful,” said he, “for the wish you express [3] ,</p>
<p>But have no occasion for such a fine dress;</p>
<p>I rather remain with my little limbs free,</p>
<p>Than to hobble [4] about, singing chick-a-de-dee.”</p>
<p>8．“There is One, my dear child, though I can not tell who,</p>
<p>Has clothed me already, and warm enough, too.</p>
<p>Good morning! Oh, who are so happy as we?”</p>
<p>And away he flew, singing his chick-a-de-dee.</p>

<p>7．“我很感激，”他说，“谢谢你们的好意，</p>
<p>但是我并不一定需要那么漂亮的裙子；</p>
<p>我宁愿光着我的脚丫自由自在，</p>
<p>胜过唱着滴呖呖却一瘸一拐。”</p>

<p>他飞走了，唱着他那滴呖呖的歌。</p>

<p>MOUNTAINS</p>
<p>高山</p>
<p>1．The Himalayas [1] are the highest mountains on our globe. They are
in Asia, and separate India from Thibet. They extend in a continuous
line for more than a thousand miles.</p>
<p>2．If you ever ascend [2] one of these mountains from the plain
below, you will have to cross an unhealthy border, twenty miles in
width. It is, in fact, a swamp [3] caused by the waters overflowing the
river banks.</p>
<p>3．The soil of this swampy border is covered with trees and shrubs,
where the tiger, the elephant, and other animals find secure retreat [4]
. Beyond this border, you will reach smiling valleys and noble
forests.</p>
<p>4．As you advance [5] onward and upward, you will get among bolder
and more rugged [6] scenes. The sides of the mountains are very steep,
sometimes well wooded to quite a height, but sometimes quite barren [7]
.</p>
<p>5．In crossing a river you must be content with three ropes for a
bridge. You will find the streets of the towns to be simply stairs cut
out of the rock, and see the houses rising in tiers [8] .</p>
<p>6．The pathways into Thibet, among these mountains, are mere tracks
by the side of foaming torrents. Often, as you advance, you will find
every trace of the path swept away by the falling of rocks and earth
from above.</p>
<p>7．Sometimes you will find posts driven into the mountain side, upon
which branches of trees and earth are spread. This forms a trembling
foothold [9] for the traveler.</p>
<p>8．In the Andes [10] , in South America, the sure-footed mule is used
to carry travelers. Quite often a chasm [11] must be crossed that is
many feet wide and hundreds of feet deep. The mule will leap across this
chasm, but not until it is sure it can make a safe jump.</p>
<p>9．“One day,” says a traveler, “I went by the worst pass over the
Andes Mountains. The path for seventy yards was very narrow, and at one
point it was washed entirely away. On one side the rock brushed my
shoulder, and on the other side my foot overhung the precipice [12]
.”</p>
<p>10．The guide told this man, after he was safely over the pass, that,
to his knowledge [13] , four hundred mules had fallen over that
precipice, and in many instances travelers had lost their lives at that
terrible spot.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-236">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．喜马拉雅山是地球上最高的山，位于亚洲，在印度与中国西藏之间，山脉连绵超过一千英里。</p>
<p>2．如果你试图从山脚的平原登上其中一座山峰，你就必须跨越一条危及生命的边界线，宽度达到了二十英里。实际上，那是一片由于河水溢出河床流到岸边形成的沼泽地。</p>
<p>3．沼泽边境的土壤被树林与灌木丛所覆盖，在那里，老虎、大象等动物寻找安全的退路。跨越了这片边界地，你就能到达开阔的山谷和郁郁葱葱的森林。</p>
<p>4．当你继续向上攀登，你会置身于更粗糙、更崎岖的山野之间。山崖十分陡峭，有时即便很高的地方也生长着茂盛的树木，有时则相当贫瘠荒凉。</p>
<p>5．越过河流的时候，要是能有一条三根绳子做成的桥，你就该感到满足了。走进市镇，你会发现街道是直接在岩石上开凿而成的，房子一排排拔地而起。</p>
<p>6．进入西藏的小路蜿蜒在山间，小路一侧就是怒吼着的滚滚洪流，通常你会发现前进的路上没有任何足迹，因为从山上滚落的石头和沙泥把本来留下的足迹都一扫而空了。</p>
<p>7．有时你会看到山崖上插着柱子，在上面铺着树枝和泥土，这样就给人提供了站脚的地方。虽然还是让人心惊胆战，但至少能供旅人通过。</p>
<p>8．在位于南美洲的安第斯山脉，旅客们使用步伐稳健的骡子作为坐骑。通常，当必须跨越好几英尺宽、几百英尺深的峡谷时，这种骡子会一跃而过。当然，如果它们不确定自己可以越过的话，是不会冒险的。</p>
<p>9．“有一天，”一位旅客说，“我遇到了安第斯山脉最糟糕的路况。有一段路长达七十码，而且非常狭窄，有一个地方的路完全被冲走了。我只好任由一侧的肩膀被岩石摩擦着，另一侧的脚就吊挂在悬崖边上。”</p>
<p>10．在这位旅客安全通过了那条路之后，一位向导告诉他，据他所知，在那个悬崖大概摔死过四百头骡子，还有很多旅客在那个可怕的地方失去了生命。</p>

<p>HOLDING THE FORT</p>
<p>守住堡垒</p>
<p>1．While Genie was walking slowly down street one day, she heard an
odd rapping on the pavement [1] behind her. Looking round, she saw Rob
Grey hobbling on crutches [2] .</p>
<p>2．“Why, what is the matter?” cried Genie. “I haven’t seen you for a
week, and now you are walking in that way.”</p>
<p>3．“I shall have to walk in this way as much as a week longer, Genie.
I sprained [3] my ankle by stopping too quick—no, not too quick, either,
for there was something in my way.”</p>
<p>“What was it?” asked Genie.</p>
<p>4．“One of the Commandments [4] ,” replied Rob. “You remember how
that lecturer [5] talked to us about ‘holding the fort’? Well, I thought
I should like to do it; but it’s a pretty long war, you know—all a
lifetime, and no vacations [6] —furloughs [7] , I think they call
them.”</p>
<p>5．“If there was nothing to fight, we should not need to be
soldiers,” said Genie.</p>
<p>6．“Well, I thought I would try; but the first day, when we came out
of the schoolhouse, Jack Lee snatched my books out of my hand, and threw
them into the mud.”</p>
<p>7．“I started after him as fast as I could run. I meant to throw him
where he had thrown the books, when, all of a sudden, I thought of the
Commandment about returning good for evil.”</p>
<p>8．“I stopped short—so short, that, somehow, my foot twisted under
me. So, you see, it was one of the Commandments.”</p>
<p>9．“If one must stumble at them, it is a good thing to fall on the
right side,” said Genie, with a wise nod of her head.</p>
<p>10．“The whole thing puzzles me, and makes me feel—well, like giving
it up,” said Rob. “It might have served me right when I was chasing
Jack; but when I thought of the Commandment, I really tried to do the
right thing.”</p>
<p>11．“You did do it, Rob,” said Genie. “You ‘held the fort’ that time.
Why, don’t you see—you are only a wounded [8] soldier.”</p>
<p>12．“I never thought of that,” said Rob. “If I believe that way—” He
began to whistle, and limped off to school without finishing the
sentence. But Genie knew, by the way he behaved [9] that day, that he
had made up his mind to hold the fort.</p>

<p>1．有一天，吉妮在街上慢慢走着，忽然听到后面人行道上传来奇怪的敲击声。回头一看，原来是罗伯·格雷拄着拐杖一瘸一拐地走过来。</p>
<p>2．“怎么了？发生了什么事？”吉妮不禁大声问道。“一个星期没见你，你走路怎么这个样子？”</p>
<p>3．“接下来至少一个星期我都得这样走路，吉妮。我突然很快停下来，所以摔坏了膝盖。不，也不是因为停得太快，是因为有东西挡住了我的路。”</p>
<p>吉妮问：“是什么东西啊？”</p>
<p>4．“就是其中一条戒律，”罗伯继续说，“你记得老师跟我们讲过的‘守住堡垒’那条戒律吗？啊，我那时想我应该这么做；可是你知道，这是一场持久战——整整一生，没有假期——暂时的休息都不行，我想他们是这么说的。”</p>
<p>5．“如果没有什么需要我们为之战斗，那么我们就不需要成为战士了。”吉妮说。</p>
<p>6．“嗯，我想我会试着去做；但是我们离开校舍的第一天，杰克·李忽然把我手里的书抢了过去，扔在烂泥地里。”</p>
<p>7．“我马上用最快的速度跑去追他，满脑子想着要抓住他，把他推到扔我书的那块烂泥地里。可是忽然间，我想起了‘以德报怨’那条戒律。”</p>
<p>8．“我突然停住脚步——停得太快了，不知道怎么地就把脚给扭了。所以，你看，就是一条戒律把我绊倒的。”</p>
<p>9．“如果一个人必须被戒律绊倒，那么倒向正确的一边也是一件好事。”吉妮一边说，一边睿智地点头。</p>
<p>10．“这件事情让我困惑，使我想着，嗯，想要放弃，”罗伯说，“如果是在我追杰克的时候摔倒，我能想得通，可是却在当我想起戒律的时候，那时我是真想做正确的事情啊。”</p>
<p>11．“罗伯，你确实做了正确的事情，”吉妮说，“那一刻你守住了堡垒。怎么，你还不明白吗——只不过你是一名负伤的战士。”</p>
<p>12．“我从来没这么想过，”罗伯说，“要是我这么想的话……”他吹起了口哨，抬起脚一瘸一拐地往学校走去，话也没说完。但是吉妮明白，从罗伯那天的举动就知道，他已经下定决心，要“守住堡垒”。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-1-perseverance">LESSON 1 PERSEVERANCE</h2>
<p>坚持不懈</p>
<p>1．“Will you give my kite a lift?” said my little nephew to his
sister, after trying in vain to make it fly by dragging it along the
ground. Lucy very kindly took it up and threw it into the air, but, her
brother neglecting to run off at the same moment, the kite fell down
again.</p>
<p>2．“Ah! now, how awkward you are!” said the little fellow. “It was
your fault entirely,” answered his sister．“Try again, children,” said
I.</p>
<p>3．Lucy once more took up the kite．But now John was in too great a
hurry; he ran off so suddenly that he twitched the kite out of her hand,
and it fell flat as before．“Well, who is to blame now?” asked
Lucy．“Try again,” said I.</p>
<p>4．They did, and with more care; but a side wind coming suddenly, as
Lucy let go the kite, it was blown against some shrubs, and the tail
became entangled (1) in a moment, leaving the poor kite hanging with its
head downward.</p>
<p>5．“There, there!” exclaimed John, “that comes of your throwing it
all to one side.” “As if I could make the wind blow straight,” said
Lucy．In the meantime, I went to the kite’s assistance (2) ; and having
disengaged (3) the long tail, I rolled it up, saying, “Come, children,
there are too many trees here; let us find a more open space, and then
try again.”</p>
<p>6．We presently found a nice grassplot (4) , at one side of which I
took my stand; and all things being prepared, I tossed the kite up just
as little John ran off．It rose with all the dignity (5) of a balloon,
and promised a lofty flight; but John, delighted to find it pulling so
hard at the string, stopped short to look upward and admire．The string
slackened, the kite wavered, and, the wind not being very favorable,
down came the kite to the grass．“O John, you should not have stopped,”
said I．“However, try again.”</p>
<p>7．“I won’t try any more,” replied he, rather sullenly．“It is of no
use, you see．The kite won’t fly, and I don’t want to be plagued with it
any longer.” “Oh, fie, my little man! Would you give up the sport, after
all the pains we have taken both to make and to fly the kite? A few
disappointments (6) ought not to discourage (7) us．Come, I have wound
up your string, and now try again.”</p>
<p>8．And he did try, and succeeded, for the kite was carried upward on
the breeze as lightly as a feather; and when the string was all out,
John stood in great delight, holding fast the stick and gazing on the
kite, which now seemed like a little white speck in the blue sky. “Look,
look, aunt, how high it flies! and it pulls like a team of horses, so
that I can hardly hold it．I wish I had a mile of string: I am sure it
would go to the end of it.”</p>
<p>9．After enjoying the sight as long as he pleased, little John
proceeded to roll up the string slowly; and when the kite fell, he took
it up with great glee (8) , saying that it was not at all hurt, and that
it had behaved very well．“Shall we come out to-morrow, aunt, after
lessons, and try again?”</p>
<p>10．“I have no objection, my dear, if the weather is fine．And now,
as we walk home, tell me what you have learned you’re your morning’s
sport.” “I have learned to fly my kite properly.” “You may thank aunt
for it, brother,” said Lucy, “for you would have given it up long ago,
if she had not persuaded you to try again.”</p>
<p>11．“Yes, dear children, I wish to teach you the value of
perseverance (9) , even when nothing more depends upon it than the
flying of a kite. Whenever you fail in your attempts to do any good
thing, let your motto (10) be,—try again.”</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is the subject of this lesson? Why was John
discouraged in his attempts to fly his kite? What did his, aunt say to
him? What may we learn from this? What should be our motto if we expect
to be successful?</p>

<p>1．“你能帮我把风筝放飞吗？”我的小侄子对他的姐姐说。之前他在地上拖着风筝，放了好久也没让它飞起来。露西很热心地拿起风筝，扔向天空，但弟弟并没有同一时候跑出去，风筝又掉下来了。</p>
<p>2．“唉，你可真笨！”小家伙说。姐姐反驳道：“都是你的错。”我说：“孩子们，再试一次。”</p>
<p>3．露西再一次拿起风筝。但是，这次约翰又太快了，他起跑太突然，以至把姐姐拿着的风筝扯得脱了手，风筝又像以前一样掉在地上。露西说：“看，这次怨谁啊？”我说：“再试一次。”</p>
<p>4．他们又试了一次，并且更加小心。但是，当露西松手放开风筝的时候，一阵风突然斜着吹过来，把风筝吹到一片灌木丛里。风筝的尾部缠绕在一起，可怜的风筝头朝下挂在那了。</p>
<p>5．“看吧，看吧，都怪你总朝着一边扔。”约翰喊着。露西也不示弱地说：“好像我能让风直着吹似的。”这时，我过去帮着把风筝尾部解开，并收起来，跟他们说：“来吧，孩子们，这里的树太多了，我们找一个开阔的地方，再试试吧。”</p>
<p>6．我们发现了一片非常不错的青草地，我在青草地的一边站定。一切就绪之后，约翰开始起跑，我把风筝高高地抛起。风筝向气球一样升起来了，似乎预示着能飞行成功。但是，当约翰发现它在用力地扯动风筝线时，由于太过高兴，停下脚步抬头看着飞起来的风筝。线松了，风筝开始摇摆，加上风势也不太理想，风筝又掉到了草地上。我说：“约翰，你不应该停下来了呢，不管怎么，再试一次。”</p>
<p>7．约翰特别不高兴地说，“我不会再试了，你看到了，这根本就没用。风筝飞不起来。我不想再被它折磨了。”“嘿，小家伙。咱们做风筝、放风筝费了好大劲，你现在却要放弃了吗？一点点挫折就能让我们灰心吗？来，我把线缠好了，咱们再试一次。”</p>
<p>8．他确实又试了一次，这次成功了，风筝随着清风像羽毛一样向上飞起。最后线都用完了，约翰特别高兴地站在那儿，紧握着风筝杆。盯着天上的风筝，现在它已经是蓝天上的一个小点了。“看啊，姑姑，看啊，风筝飞得多高啊！感觉像是一群马在拉绳子，我都快拉不住了。我真希望有一英里那么长的线，那样肯定都能放完。”</p>
<p>9．尽情享受了一会儿，小约翰开始慢慢地收回风筝线。风筝落下来的时候，他欢快地捡起来，并说它毫发未损，刚刚的表现棒极了。“姑姑，明天放学后我们再来，再试一次，好吗？”</p>
<p>10．“如果天气允许的话，我没意见，亲爱的孩子们，现在咱们往家走，边走你边告诉我，今天上午的活动你学到什么了吗？”“我学到了怎么能好好地放风筝。”“那可得谢谢姑姑，”露西说，“要不是她说让你再试一次，你早就放弃了。”</p>
<p>11．“没错，亲爱的孩子们，尽管有些事情不一定需要放风筝的这种坚持不懈，但我希望能够通过这件事教给你们这种精神的意义所在。任何时候，试了很多次都没成功，记着这句话：再试一次。”</p>

<p>海水为什么是咸的</p>
<p>Mary Howitt was born in 1804, at Coleford, England. She wrote many
charming stories for children in prose and verse, and also translated
many from Swedish, Danish, and German authors. This story is arranged
from one in a collection named “Peter Drake’s Dream, and Other Stories.”
She died in 1888.</p>
<p>1．There were, in very ancient times, two brothers, one of whom was
rich, and the other poor．Christmas was approaching, but the poor man
had nothing in the house for a Christmas dinner; so he went to his
brother and asked him for a trifling (1) gift.</p>
<p>2．The rich man was ill-natured, and when he heard his brother’s
request he looked very surly．But as Christmas is a time when even the
worst people give gifts, he took a fine ham down from the chimney, where
it was hanging to smoke, threw it at his brother, and bade him begone
and never to let him see his face again.</p>
<p>3．The poor man thanked his brother for the ham, put it under his
arm, and went his way．He had to pass through a great forest on his way
home．When he had reached the thickest part of it, he saw an old man,
with a long, white beard, hewing timber. “Good evening,” said he to
him.</p>
<p>4．“Good evening,” returned the old man, raising himself up from his
work, and looking at him. “That is a fine ham you are carrying.” On
this, the poor man told him all about it.</p>
<p>5．“It is lucky for you,” said the old man, “that you have met with
me．If you will take that ham into the land of the dwarfs, the entrance
to which lies just under the roots of this tree, you can make a capital
bargain with it; for the dwarfs are very fond of ham, and rarely get
any．But mind what I say: you must not sell it for money, but demand for
it the ‘old hand mill (2) which stands behind the door.’ When you come
back, I’ll show you how to use it.”</p>
<p>6．The poor man thanked his new friend, who showed him the door under
a stone below the roots of the tree, and by this door he entered into
the land of the dwarfs．No sooner had he set his foot in it, than the
dwarfs swarmed about him, attracted (3) by the smell of the ham．They
offered him queer, old-fashioned money and gold and silver ore for it;
but he refused all their tempting offers, and said that he would sell it
only for the old hand mill behind the door.</p>
<p>7．At this, the dwarfs held up their little old hands, and looked
quite perplexed (4) . “We can not make a bargain, it seems,” said the
poor man, “so I’ll bid you all a good day.”</p>
<p>8．The fragrance (5) of the ham had by this time reached the remote
parts of dwarf land．The dwarfs came flocking around in little troops,
leaving their work of digging out precious ores, eager for the ham.</p>
<p>9．“Let him have the old mill,” said some of the newcomers; “it is
quite out of order, and he don’t know how to use it．Let him have it,
and we will have the ham.”</p>
<p>10．So the bargain was made．The poor man took the old hand mill,
which was a little thing not half so large as the ham, and went back to
the woods．Here the old man showed him how to use it．All this had taken
up a great deal of time, and it was midnight before he reached home.</p>
<p>11．“Where in the world have you been?” said his wife. “Here I have
been waiting and waiting, and we have no wood to make a fire, nor
anything to put into the porridge pot for our Christmas supper.”</p>
<p>12．The house was dark and cold; but the poor man bade his wife wait
and see what would happen．He placed the little hand mill on the table,
and began to turn the crank．First, out there came some grand, lighted
wax candles, and a fire on the hearth, and a porridge pot boiling over
it, because in his mind he said they should come first. Then he ground
out a tablecloth, and dishes, and spoons, and knives and forks.</p>
<p>13．He was himself astonished at his good luck, as you may believe;
and his wife was almost beside herself with joy and astonishment．Well,
they had a capital supper; and after it was eaten, they ground out of
the mill every possible thing to make their house and themselves warm
and comfortable．So they had a merry Christmas eve and morning.</p>

<p>玛丽·豪伊特，1804年生于英国科尔福德，她以散文和诗歌的形式给孩子们写了很多美妙的故事，同时翻译了很多瑞典、丹麦和德国作家的作品。这则故事选自文集《彼得·德雷克的梦和其他故事》。玛丽·豪伊特于1888年去世。</p>
<p>1．很早很早以前，有两个兄弟，一个很富有，另一个很贫穷。快到圣诞节了，穷人家里没有任何可以作为圣诞夜晚餐的食物，所以他去找他的兄弟，想从他那里得到些微不足道的小礼物。</p>
<p>2．富人心地不好，听说穷人的请求后，他面色阴沉。但是，在圣诞节时，即使是最坏的人都要送出礼物，富人家的烟囱里正在熏制上好的火腿，在那儿熏了一段时间了，他取下来扔给穷人，并命令他马上消失，再也不要出现在他面前。</p>
<p>3．穷人感谢富人送给他火腿，他把火腿夹在胳膊下面离开了。回家路上他需要经过一片森林。当经过森林最茂密的地方时，他看见一位留着长长的白胡须的老人正伐木。他向老人打招呼：“晚上好。”</p>
<p>4．老人从劳作中抬起头来，看着他，回说：“晚上好。你手里的那块火腿可真不错。”这时候，穷人把关于火腿的事都告诉了老人。</p>
<p>5．老人说：“你很幸运能遇见我。你拿着火腿到矮人国去，矮人国的入口就在这棵树的树根下，你可以用火腿跟他们大大地讨价还价一番，因为矮人们非常喜欢火腿，但他们很难弄到。但要记住我说的：你万万不能用火腿换钱，而是要门后面那台‘老旧的手动磨粉机’。回来之后，我会告诉你怎么使用它。”</p>
<p>6．老人指给他看，树根下有块大石头，大石头下面就是通往矮人国的门。穷人谢过新朋友，从这扇门进入了矮人国。他的双脚刚踏上矮人国的土地，被火腿味道吸引了的矮人们就冲向了他。矮人们想用奇怪的古老钱币和金银宝石来换火腿，但穷人拒绝了所有诱人的条件，说他只想用火腿换门后面老旧的手动磨粉机。</p>
<p>7．听到这里，矮人们对他的这一举动感到疑惑不解，纷纷举起他们饱经沧桑的小手。穷人说：“看来我们做不成买卖了，再见吧，祝你们拥有愉快的一天。”</p>
<p>8．这时，火腿的香气已经飘到了矮人国的深处。矮人们停下正在挖宝的工作，成群结队地纷纷聚集过来，迫不及待地想要得到火腿。</p>
<p>9．有些刚来的矮人说：“就把老旧的手动磨粉机给他吧，已经不能用了，再说，他也不会用。就给他吧，这样火腿就归我们了。”</p>
<p>10．交易就这么成交了。那台手动磨粉机很小，还不到火腿的一半大。穷人拿着它回到了森林里。老人告诉他手动磨粉机怎样使用。整个过程花了好长时间，所以他到家时已经快到午夜了。</p>
<p>11．他妻子问：“你到底到哪儿去了？我在这儿等啊等，我们既没有柴火烧，也没有什么能下锅的食物来做一顿圣诞晚餐。”</p>
<p>12．屋里又冷又黑，但穷人让他的妻子等着，看看会发生什么。他把小小的手动磨粉机放在桌子上，开始摇动手柄。先是磨出来一些华丽的燃烧着的蜡烛，然后是壁炉里的火焰，上面有一锅热腾腾的粥。在他印象里，他觉得这些应该先出来。接着，他磨出来一张桌布，还有餐具、勺子、刀叉。</p>
<p>13．就像你所想的一样，连他都惊讶于自己的好运气，他妻子既高兴又惊讶，几乎不能自已。就这样，他们享用了一顿极好的晚餐。晚餐后，他们又磨出了各种能让他们的屋子和他们自己感到温暖舒适的物品。于是，他们度过了一个非常美妙的圣诞前夜和圣诞节早晨。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-4-why-the-sea-is-saltconcluded">LESSON 4 WHY THE SEA IS
SALT（CONCLUDED）</h2>
<p>海水为什么是咸的（结束篇）</p>
<p>1．When the people went by the house to church, the next day, they
could hardly believe their eyes．There was glass in the windows instead
of a wooden shutter, and the poor man and his wife, dressed in nice new
clothes, were seen devoutly (1) kneeling in the church.</p>
<p>2．“There is something very strange in all this,” said everyone.
“Something very strange indeed,” said the rich man, when three days
afterwards he received an invitation from his once poor brother to a
grand feast．And what a feast it was! The table was covered with a cloth
as white as snow, and the dishes were all of silver or gold．The rich
man could not, in his great house, and with all his wealth, set out such
a table.</p>
<p>3．“Where did you get all these things?” exclaimed he．His brother
told him all about the bargain he had made with the dwarfs, and putting
the mill on the table, ground out boots and shoes, coats and cloaks,
stockings, gowns, and blankets, and bade his wife give them to the poor
people that had gathered about the house to get a sight of the grand
feast the poor brother had made for the rich one.</p>
<p>4．The rich man, was very envious of his brother’s good fortune, and
wanted to borrow the mill, intending—for he was not an honest man—never
to return it again．His brother would not lend it, for the old man with
the white beard had told him never to sell or lend it to anyone.</p>
<p>5．Some years went on, and, at last, the possessor of the mill built
himself a grand castle on a rock by the sea, facing the west．Its
windows, reflecting (2) the golden sunset, could be seen far out from
the shore．It became a noted landmark (3) for sailors．Strangers from
foreign parts often came to see this castle and the wonderful mill of
which the most extraordinary (4) tales were told.</p>
<p>6．At length, a great foreign merchant came, and when he had seen the
mill, inquired whether it would grind salt．Being told that it would, he
wanted to buy it; for he traded in salt, and thought that if he owned it
he could supply all his customers without taking long and dangerous
voyages.</p>
<p>7．The man would not sell it, of course．He was so rich now that he
did not want to use it for himself; but every Christmas he ground out
food and clothes and coal for the poor, and nice presents for the little
children．So he rejected all the offers of the rich merchant．The
merchant, however, determined to have it; he bribed one of the man’s
servants to let him go into the castle at night, and he stole the mill
and sailed away with it in triumph.</p>
<p>8．He had scarcely got out to sea, before he determined to set the
mill to work. “Now, mill, grind salt,” said he; “grind salt with all
your might!—salt, salt, and nothing but salt!” The mill began to grind
and the sailors to fill the sacks; but these were soon full, and in
spite of all that could be done, it began to fill the ship.</p>
<p>9．The dishonest merchant was now very much frightened．What was to
be done? The mill would not stop grinding; and at last the ship was
overloaded, and down it went, making a great whirlpool (5) where it
sank．The ship soon went to pieces; but the mill stands on the bottom of
the sea, and keeps grinding out “salt, salt, nothing but salt!” That is
the reason, say the peasants (6) of Denmark and Norway, why the sea is
salt.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is a “fairy tale”? What fairy people are told about
in this story? How did the poor man find the way to the land of the
dwarfs? Do you think the old man would have told him if the poor man had
not been so polite? How did the poor man treat his rich brother in
return for his unkindness? How was the greed of the dishonest merchant
punished? What is meant by “strangers from foreign parts”? Where are
Denmark and Norway?</p>

<p>1．第二天，当人们去教堂路过穷人家时，他们简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。他家的窗户上原有的木头窗板不见了，而是装上了玻璃。穷人和他的妻子穿着体面的新衣服，虔诚地跪在教堂祈祷。</p>
<p>2．每个人都说：“这其中一定有蹊跷。”三天之后，富人收到了他那曾经非常贫穷的兄弟发来的请柬，邀请他去享用一顿盛宴。富人说：“的确是特别奇怪的事。”这是怎样豪华的盛宴啊！桌上的桌布像雪一样洁白，餐具要么是金的，要么是银的。富人即便倾其所有，也无法在自己的房子里布置出这样的一餐。</p>
<p>3．他大声地问：“你从哪儿弄到这些东西的？”穷人把他和矮人们达成交易的一切都告诉了他，然后把手动磨粉机放在桌子上，磨出了靴子和鞋子，外衣和斗篷，还有袜子、袍子、毛毯。他让妻子把这些东西送给聚集在他们家周围的穷人，他们围在房子周围，想看看穷兄弟给富兄弟准备的豪华盛宴。</p>
<p>4．富人很嫉妒他兄弟的好运气，想要借这台手动磨粉机。但是，他不是个守信的人，他根本没打算还。他兄弟不借给他，因为他遇见的白胡子老人告诫过他千万不要把这台手动磨粉机卖给或者借给任何人。</p>
<p>5．多年过去了，最终，手动磨粉机的拥有者为自己建了一座很大的城堡，坐落在海边的岩石上，朝向西方。城堡的窗户映照着金色的落日，远远从海岸上就能看到。这座城堡成为水手们的一个重要坐标。手动磨粉机的传奇故事传开了，很多外乡的陌生人常常慕名而来，参观这座城堡和那台神奇的手动磨粉机。</p>
<p>6．终于有一天，一个外国富商来到这里。当他看到手动磨粉机后，他问能不能磨出盐来。听说可以之后，他想要买下它。因为他从事的是盐业贸易，想着如果有了这台手动磨粉机，他再也不用经受漫长且危险的旅途运盐，就能供应他的所有客户足够的盐了。</p>
<p>7．当然，手动磨粉机的拥有者不会卖掉它。他现在这么富有，根本不想为自己的利益去使用它。他只是在每年的圣诞节，为穷人们磨出食物、衣服和煤炭，为小孩子们磨出精美的礼物。所以，他拒绝了富商的一切出价。然而，这个富商执意要得到它，他贿赂了一个仆人，让他在夜里偷偷溜进城堡，把手动磨粉机偷了出来。最后，外国富商带着胜利的喜悦乘船离去。</p>
<p>8．船刚一开到海上，他就迫不及待开始使用手动磨粉机了。他说：“快，磨起来，给我出盐，开足马力出盐——盐！盐！除了盐还是盐！”手动磨粉机磨出了盐，水手们把盐装进麻袋，很快所有的麻袋都满了。尽管他们能做的都做了，盐还是装满了整艘船。</p>
<p>9．这个不诚实的商人现在感到非常害怕。能做些什么呢？手动磨粉机不停地出盐。最后，轮船超重，沉了下去，沉没的地方掀起了巨大的漩涡。轮船很快四分五裂，但手动磨粉机沉到了深深的海底，还在不停地出盐。“盐！盐！除了盐还是盐！”丹麦和挪威一代的农民说，海水为什么是咸的，这就是原因。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-6-smiles">LESSON 6 SMILES</h2>
<p>微笑</p>
<p>1．Poor lame Jennie sat at her window, looking out upon the dismal
(1) , narrow street, with a look of pain and weariness on her face. “Oh,
dear,” she said with a sigh, “what a long day this is going to be,” and
she looked wishfully (2) up the street.</p>
<p>2．Suddenly she leaned forward and pressed her pale face against the
glass, as a rosy-cheeked boy came racing down the street, swinging his
schoolbooks by the strap．Looking up to the window, he took off his hat
and bowed with a bright, pleasant smile.</p>
<p>3．“What a nice boy he is,” said Jennie to herself, as he ran out of
sight．“I am so glad he goes by here on his way to school．When he
smiles, it seems like having the sun shine．I wish everybody who goes by
would look up and smile.”</p>
<p>4．“Mamma,” said George West, as he came from school, “I can’t help
thinking about that poor little girl I told you of the other day. She
looks so tired．I took off my hat and bowed to her to-day．I wish I
could do something for her.”</p>
<p>5．“Suppose you should carry her a handful of pretty flowers some
time when you go to school,” said Mrs．West．“I’ll do that to-morrow
morning,” said George, “if I can find my way into that rickety (3) old
house.”</p>
<p>6．The next morning, as Jennie sat leaning her head wearily against
the window, watching the raindrops chasing one another down the glass,
she spied George with a handful of beautiful flowers carefully picking
his way across the street．He stopped in front of her window, and,
smiling very pleasantly, said, “How shall I find the way to your
room?”</p>
<p>7．Jennie pointed to an alley near by, where he turned in, and with
some difficulty found his way to the dingy (4) staircase．Opening the
door to Jennie’s gentle “Come in,” he said, “I have brought you a
handful of flowers to look at this rainy day.”</p>
<p>8．“Are they for me?” exclaimed Jennie, clapping her hands in
delight．“How kind you are,” she continued, as George laid them in her
lap．“I have not had a flower since we live in the city.”</p>
<p>9．“Did you use to live in the country?” asked George．“Oh, yes,”
answered Jennie, “we used to live in a beautiful cottage, and there were
trees and flowers and green grass, and the air was so sweet.”</p>
<p>10．“Well, what made you move here?” “Oh,” said Jennie, softly, “papa
died, and mamma was sick so long that the money was all gone．Then mamma
had to sell the cottage, and she moved here to try to get work to
do.”</p>
<p>11．“Do you have to sit here all day?” asked George, glancing (5)
around the bare room and out into the dismal street．“Yes,” said Jennie,
“because I am lame; but I would not care for that, if I could only help
mamma.”</p>
<p>12．“I declare, it’s too had!” said George, who dreaded nothing so
much as being obliged to stay in the house．“Oh, no, it isn’t,” said
Jennie, pleasantly; “mamma says maybe we should forget the Lord if we
had everything we wanted, and He never forgets us, you know.”</p>
<p>13．“Well, I must rush for school,” said George, not knowing exactly
what to say next; and he was soon out of Jennie’s sight, but had a happy
little corner in his heart, because he had tried to do a kind act．He
did not know how much good he had done in making a pleasant day out of a
dreary (6) one for a little sick girl.</p>
<p>14．“Mamma,” said George, that evening, after he had told her what
Jennie said, “papa must give them some money, so they can go back to
their home.”</p>
<p>15．“No,” said his mother; “he can not do that, and they would not
wish him to do so; but perhaps he can help us contrive (7) some way to
assist them, so that they can live more comfortably.”</p>
<p>16．“I am going to carry Jennie some of the grapes grandpa sent me,
to-morrow,” said George, turning over the leaves of his geography．“I
will put some of my pears into your basket, and go with you,” said his
mother; “but there is one thing we can always give, and sometimes it
does more good than nice things to eat, or even money.”</p>
<p>17．“What is that, mamma,—smiles?” asked George, looking up. “Yes,”
answered his mother; “and it is a good plan to throw in a kind word or
two with them when you can.”</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is the subject of this lesson? How did George West
make the day pleasant for Jennie? What did his mother suggest? What
happened next day? What did Jennie tell George about her life? Relate
what happened at George’s home that evening．What does the lesson
teach?</p>

<p>1．可怜的跛腿珍妮坐在窗户旁，看着阴郁、狭窄的街道，脸上写满痛苦和倦意。她叹了口气：“唉，天哪，这将是多么漫长的一天啊。”然后她又眼巴巴地望着街道。</p>
<p>2．突然，她身子前倾，苍白的面颊紧紧贴着窗户玻璃。因为有个男孩沿着这条街跑过来，他脸颊红红，手里抓着书包背带晃来晃去。他抬头看了一眼窗户，然后摘下帽子，鞠躬打招呼，脸上是明亮、欢快的笑容。</p>
<p>3．看着他渐渐消失在视野里，珍妮自言自语：“他真是个可爱的男孩。真高兴他每天上学都从这儿路过。他一笑，我觉得就像阳光一样温暖。真希望每个路过的人都会抬头微笑一下。”</p>
<p>4．“妈妈，”乔治·威斯特放学刚回到家叫道，“我总是不由自主地想着我前两天和您说过的那个可怜的小女孩。她看起来特别累。今天我摘下帽子冲她鞠躬行礼了。我想为她做点什么。”</p>
<p>5．威斯特夫人说：“也许什么时候你可以在上学的路上给她带一束漂亮的鲜花。”“明天早上我就这么做，只要我能找到去那栋老旧危房的路，”乔治说。</p>
<p>6．第二天清晨，珍妮坐在窗户边，倦怠地将头靠在窗户上，看着雨点一滴一滴沿着玻璃流下去，这时候，她看到乔治拿着一束美丽的鲜花，小心翼翼地穿过马路。他停在珍妮的窗前，非常友善地笑着说：“我怎么才能走到你的房间那边呢？”</p>
<p>7．珍妮指了指旁边的一条小径，男孩拐了进去，非常费劲地走到昏暗的楼梯旁。顺着珍妮轻柔的一声“进来”，门开了。他说：“我给你带来一束鲜花，在这雨天可以观赏。”</p>
<p>8．“这是给我的吗？”珍妮惊呼，欢快地拍起手来。乔治把花放在她腿上，她继续说：“你可真好！自从搬到城里来，我一朵花都没有过。”</p>
<p>9．乔治问：“你们以前住在乡村吗？”“是啊，我们以前住在一个漂亮的村舍里，那里树很多，还有花花草草，连空气都是甜的。”珍妮说道。</p>
<p>10．“那你怎么搬到这边来了啊？”“唉，我爸爸死了，”珍妮轻声说，“妈妈生病好长时间了，我们没有钱了，妈妈就把村舍卖了，搬到这儿来想找份工作。”</p>
<p>11．乔治看了一圈空荡荡的房间和阴郁的窗外，问道，“那你每天只能坐在这儿吗？”珍妮说：“是啊，我的腿不好，不过我没事儿，只要能帮助妈妈就好。”</p>
<p>12．“我觉得这太糟了！”乔治说。他什么都不怕，就怕被迫待在房间里。“不，不，不是的，”珍妮高兴地说：“妈妈说如果我们什么都有了，我们可能会忘记神，但神从来不会忘记我们的，你知道吧。”</p>
<p>13．乔治不知道下面该说些什么，只好说：“哎呀，我得赶紧去学校了。”他很快消失在珍妮的视线里。他内心深处特别开心，因为他努力做了件好事。但是，他还不知道把这可怜的小女孩阴沉沉的一天变得快乐起来是多大的善举。</p>
<p>14．那天晚上，乔治把珍妮的话告诉了妈妈，然后说：“妈妈，让爸爸给他们些钱吧，这样他们就能回到他们原来的家了。”</p>
<p>15．他母亲说：“不行，爸爸不能这么做。而且她们也不会希望他这么做的。不过或许他可以帮我们计划一个帮助这对母女的办法，这样她们可以过得舒服一些。”</p>
<p>16．“明天我要给珍妮带些爷爷送给我们的葡萄。”乔治边翻看地理书边说。他母亲说：“我放些梨到你篮子里，和你一起去。不过除了这些，还有一样东西我们可以给予他们，有时候这比好吃的，甚至比钱还好。”</p>
<p>17．“这是什么呢，妈妈？——微笑吗？”乔治抬头看着妈妈问。他母亲说：“是的。尽可能在微笑时说几句友善的话是个不错的方法。”</p>

<p>懒人奈德</p>
<p>1．“’T is royal (1) fun,” cried lazy Ned,</p>
<p>“To coast (2) upon my fine, new sled,</p>
<p>And beat the other boys;</p>
<p>But then, I can not bear to climb</p>
<p>The tiresome hill, for every time</p>
<p>It more and more annoys (3) .”</p>
<p>2．So, while his schoolmates glided by,</p>
<p>And gladly tugged uphill, to try</p>
<p>Another merry race,</p>
<p>Too indolent (4) to share their plays,</p>
<p>Ned was compelled to stand and gaze,</p>

<h2 id="lesson-8-the-monkey">LESSON 8 THE MONKEY</h2>
<p>猴子</p>
<p>1．The monkey is a very cunning (1) little animal, and is found in
many parts of the world.</p>
<p>2．A lady once had a monkey, which had been brought to her as a
present. This monkey, like all others, was very fond of mischief and of
doing whatever he saw others do.</p>
<p>3．His mistress found him one day sitting on her toilet table (2) ,
holding in one hand a little china mug with water in it, and in the
other her toothbrush, with which he was cleaning his teeth, looking all
the time in the glass.</p>
<p>4．Her little daughter, Maria, had a large doll with a very handsome
head and face. She one day left this doll in the cradle, and went out of
the room. The monkey came in, took the doll in his arms, and jumping
upon the washstand, he began to wash its face.</p>
<p>5．He first rubbed it all over with soap. Then seizing the towel, he
dipped it in the wash bowl, and rubbed it so hard that the doll’s face
was entirely spoiled, the paint being all washed off.</p>
<p>6．There have been many tales of monkeys who, armed with sticks, have
joined together and made war or resisted (3) their enemies with great
effect. These are not true, as it is known that in their native state
monkeys have no idea of weapons.</p>
<p>7．The sticks and other missiles (4) said to be thrown at travelers
as they pass under the branches of trees, are usually the dead branches,
etc., accidentally broken off, as the monkeys, with the natural
curiosity of their tribe, pass along the tops of trees to watch the
actions of the people below.</p>
<p>8．They can, however, be taught to use a stick, and to use it well.
Some time ago, two Italians together owned an organ and a monkey, by
means of which they earned their living. During one of their exhibitions
(5) , a dog flew at the little monkey, which made its owners very
angry.</p>
<p>9．They and the owner of the dog quarreled about it, and at last it
was agreed that the dog and the monkey should fight it out; the monkey,
because he was smaller, was to be allowed a stick.</p>
<p>10．The monkey was taught what he was to do in the following manner:
One of the Italians crawled on his hands and knees, barking like a dog,
while the other got on his back, grasped his hair, and beat him about
the head with a stick.</p>
<p>11．The monkey looked on with great gravity (6) , and, when the
instruction (7) was over, received the stick with the air of a man who
knew his work and meant to do it.</p>
<p>12．Everything being settled the dog flew at the monkey with open
month. The monkey immediately leaped on his back, and, grasping the
dog’s ear, beat away at his head with such good will that his adversary
speedily gave in. The monkey, however, was not content with a mere
victory, but continued pounding at the dog’s head until he left him
senseless (8) on the ground.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What kind of an animal is a monkey? Where did the lady
find the monkey one day? What was he doing? What did he do with Maria’s
doll? Do monkeys in their native state know how to use sticks as
weapons? Can they be taught to use them? Relate the story of the two
Italians. What is the meaning of “etc.” in the seventh paragraph?</p>

<p>1．猴子是一种非常灵巧的小动物，在世界各地都可以见到。</p>
<p>2．一位女士曾经有一只猴子，是别人送给她的礼物。像其他所有猴子一样，这只猴子很淘气，喜欢模仿别人的举动。</p>
<p>3．一天，它的主人发现它坐在自己的梳妆台上，一直看着镜子，一手抓着一个装水的小瓷杯，另一只手拿着主人的牙刷，正在刷牙呢。</p>
<p>4．女主人的小女儿玛丽亚有个大布娃娃，头和脸都很好看。有一天，玛丽亚把大布娃娃放在摇篮里，自己出去了。猴子跑进来后，把大布娃娃抱在怀里，跳上盥洗台，开始给布娃娃洗脸。</p>
<p>5．它先把布娃娃脸上擦满香皂，然后拽来一条毛巾，在洗脸盆里蘸了蘸水，使劲擦布娃娃的脸，结果擦得太用力，布娃娃的脸被擦坏了，原来的颜色都洗掉了。</p>
<p>6．曾经有很多关于猴子的传说，说它们拿棍子做武器，集体和它们的敌人开战，大获全胜。可这些都不是事实，因为众所周知，猴子们本身没有武器的概念。</p>
<p>7．当游客们经过树下，那些所谓向他们扔来的棍子和其他投掷物，通常是干枯的树枝之类的东西，恰巧断了，由于猴子这个种群好奇心的天性，从树顶一路跑下来看看人们的反应。</p>
<p>8．虽然如此，但它们可以学会用棍子，并且能用得很好。很久之前，两个意大利人拥有一架风琴和一只猴子，他们以此谋生。他们的一次公开表演中，有一只狗冲向小猴子，这让猴子的主人们非常生气。</p>
<p>9．他们和狗的主人吵了一架，最终达成一致，猴子和狗应该来场决斗。因为猴子个头比较小，允许它使用棍子。</p>
<p>10．主人们用这种方式教给猴子应该怎么做：一个人手脚着地趴在地上学狗叫，另一个骑在他背上，抓着他的头发，用棍子打他的头。</p>
<p>11．猴子很认真地看着这一切，看完整个演示之后，它接过棍子，神态俨然像一个明白自己的使命、知道如何去做的人。</p>
<p>12．一切就绪之后，那只狗张开大嘴向猴子扑来。猴子立刻跳到它的背上，抓着狗的耳朵，冲着它的头使劲打，狗的嚣张气焰立刻消失了。然而，猴子并不满足于小小的胜利，继续不停地敲击狗的头部，直到打得狗毫无知觉地昏倒在地上。</p>

<p>爱捣乱的玛蒂</p>
<p>1．Oh, how one ugly trick has spoiled</p>
<p>The sweetest and the best!</p>
<p>Matilda, though a pleasant child,</p>
<p>One grievous fault possessed,</p>
<p>Which, like a cloud before the skies,</p>
<p>Hid all her better qualities (1) .</p>
<p>2．Sometimes, she’d lift the teapot lid</p>
<p>To peep at what was in it;</p>
<p>Or tilt, the kettle, if you did</p>
<p>But turn your back a minute.</p>
<p>In vain you told her not to touch,</p>
<p>Her trick of meddling (2) grew so much.</p>
<p>3．Her grandmamma went out one day,</p>
<p>And, by mistake, she laid</p>
<p>Her spectacles and snuffbox gay,</p>
<p>Too near the little maid;</p>
<p>“Ah! well,” thought she, “I’ll try them on,</p>
<p>As soon as grandmamma is gone.”</p>
<p>4．Forthwith (3) , she placed upon her nose</p>
<p>The glasses large and wide;</p>
<p>And looking round, as I suppose,</p>
<p>The snuffbox, too, she spied (4) .</p>
<p>“Oh, what a pretty box is this!</p>
<p>I’ll open it,” said little miss.</p>
<p>5．“I know that grandmamma would say,</p>
<p>‘Don’t meddle with it, dear;’</p>
<p>But then she’s far enough away,</p>
<p>And no one else is near;</p>
<p>Beside, what can there be amiss (5)</p>
<p>In opening such a box as this?”</p>
<p>6．So, thumb and finger went to work</p>
<p>To move the stubborn lid;</p>
<p>And, presently, a mighty jerk</p>
<p>The mighty mischief did;</p>
<p>For all at once, ah! woeful (6) case!</p>
<p>The snuff came puffing in her face.</p>
<p>7．Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth, and chin</p>
<p>A dismal sight presented;</p>
<p>And as the snuff got further in,</p>
<p>Sincerely she repented.</p>
<p>In vain she ran about for ease,</p>
<p>She could do nothing else but sneeze.</p>
<p>8．She dashed the spectacles away,</p>
<p>To wipe her tingling (7) eyes;</p>
<p>And, as in twenty bits they lay,</p>
<p>Her grandmamma she spies.</p>
<p>“Heyday! and what’s the matter now?”</p>
<p>Cried grandmamma, with angry brow.</p>
<p>9．Matilda, smarting with the pain,</p>
<p>And tingling still, and sore,</p>
<p>Made many a promise to refrain (8)</p>
<p>From meddling evermore;</p>
<p>And ’t is a fact, as I have heard,</p>
<p>She ever since has kept her word.</p>

it have on her?</p>

<p>1．哦，一个丑陋的小把戏能够毁掉</p>

<p>玛蒂尔达，尽管是个甜美的孩子，</p>
<p>但她有个严重的毛病，</p>
<p>这就像天空的一片乌云，</p>
<p>遮挡了她的一切优点。</p>
<p>2．有时候，她会抬起茶壶盖，</p>

<p>或者把茶壶倾斜过来，如果你</p>
<p>只是片刻转过身。</p>
<p>尽管告诉她别碰，简直是白搭，</p>

<p>放得离小姑娘太近了</p>
<p>“哈哈，”玛蒂尔达想，“我要戴上这个，</p>

<p>4．随即，她把又宽又大的眼镜</p>

<h2 id="lesson-10-the-good-son">LESSON 10 THE GOOD SON</h2>
<p>好儿子</p>
<p>1．There was once a jeweler (1) , noted (2) for many virtues. One
day, the Jewish elders (3) came to him to buy some diamonds, to put upon
that part of the dress of their high priest, which the Bible calls an
ephod (4) .</p>
<p>2．They told him what they wanted, and offered him a fair price for
the diamonds (5) . He replied that he could not let them see the jewels
at that moment, and requested them to call again.</p>
<p>3．As they wanted them without delay, and thought that the object of
the jeweler was only to increase the price of the diamonds, the elders
offered him twice, then three times, as much as they were worth. But he
still refused, and they went away in very bad humor (6) .</p>
<p>4．Some hours after, he went to them, and placed before them the
diamonds, for which they again offered him the last price they had
named; but he said, “I will only accept the first one you offered to me
this morning.”</p>
<p>5．“Why, then, did you not close (7) with us at once?” asked they in
surprise. “When you came,” replied he, “my father had the key of the
chest, in which the diamonds were kept, and as he was asleep, I should
have been obliged to wake him to obtain them.”</p>
<p>6．“At his age, a short hour of sleep does him a great deal of good;
and for all the gold in the world, I would not be wanting in respect to
my father, or take from him a single comfort.”</p>
<p>7．The elders, affected by these feeling words, spread their hands
upon the jeweler’s head, and said, “Thou shalt be blessed of Him who has
said, ‘Honor thy father and thy mother;’ and thy children shall one day
pay thee the same respect and love thou hast shown to thy father.”</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Relate the story of the jeweler and his diamonds. What did
the elders say to him, when they heard his reason for not giving them
the diamonds at first?</p>

<p>2．他们跟他说想要什么样的珠宝，并且出了不菲的价钱。他回答说现在没法让他们看钻石，让他们稍后再来。</p>
<p>3．他们急着要钻石，觉得珠宝商的拒绝是为了抬高售价，于是，犹太人又开出了两倍的价钱，然后又加到了三倍，这是最高价了。但是，珠宝商还是拒绝了，犹太人只好悻悻离去。</p>
<p>4．几个小时之后，他找到他们，把钻石放在他们面前，他们还是开出最后一次出的价钱，但珠宝商说：“我只接受今天早上你们第一次给我出的价钱。”</p>
<p>5．“你当时为什么不立刻和我们成交呢？”他们很惊讶地问。珠宝商说：“你们来的时候，钻石锁在金库里，而我父亲拿着金库钥匙，当时他正在睡觉，如果去金库取钻石的话，我只能把他叫醒。”</p>
<p>6．“到了他这个年纪，短短一小时的睡眠也会对他有很多好处，即使给我世界上所有的金银财富，考虑到我的父亲，我也不会想要的。更不愿意牺牲任何一点父亲休息的时间。”</p>
<p>7．长老们被他深情的话感动了，把手放在他头上说：“你会得到神的祝福的，因为他说过‘尊敬你的父亲和母亲’，你的孩子们也会如你尊敬你的父亲一样尊敬你、爱你的。”</p>

<p>1．Henry Bond was about ten years old when his father died. His
mother found it difficult to provide for the support of a large family,
thus left entirely in her care. By good management (1) , however, she
contrived to do so, and also to send Henry, the oldest, to school, and
to supply him, for the most part, with such books as he needed.</p>
<p>2．At one time, however, Henry wanted a grammar, in order to join a
class in that study, and his mother could not furnish (2) him with the
money to buy it. He was very much troubled about it, and went to bed
with a heavy heart, thinking what could be done.</p>
<p>3．On waking in the morning, he found that a deep snow had fallen,
and the cold wind was blowing furiously (3) . “Ah,” said he, “it is an
ill wind that blows nobody good.”</p>
<p>4．He rose, ran to the house of a neighbor, and offered his service
(4) to clear a path around his premises (5) . The offer was accepted.
Having completed this work, and received his pay, he went to another
place for the same purpose, and then to another, until he had earned
enough to buy a grammar.</p>
<p>5．When school commenced, Henry was in his seat, the happiest boy
there, ready to begin the lesson in his new book.</p>
<p>6．From that time, Henry, was always the first in all his classes. He
knew no such word as fail, but always succeeded in all he attempted.
Having the will, he always found the way.</p>

<p>2．然而，有一次，亨利参加了一门语法课，需要一本语法书，但他母亲实在没钱给他买这本书。为此他很是烦心，晚上上床休息时还在忧心忡忡，一直想着该怎么办。</p>

<p>4．他迅速地起床，跑到邻居家，提出为邻居的房屋周围清扫积雪。邻居接受了他的提议。完成工作后，他得到一些报酬，然后又带着同一个目的去下一户人家，一家接一家，他最终挣够了买语法书的钱。</p>
<p>5．开学时，最快乐的孩子——亨利，坐在自己的座位上，已经准备好学习新书的第一课了。</p>
<p>6．从此之后，亨利总是他班级里最早到的。他的字典里没有“做不到”这个词，他总是通过一切努力获得成功。只要有目标，他就能够找到获得成功的方法。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-13-piccola">LESSON 13 PICCOLA</h2>
<p>皮克拉</p>
<p>By Celia Laighton Thaxter, who was born at Portsmouth, N. H., June
29, 1836. Much of her childhood was passed at White Island, one of the
Isles of Shoals, off the coast of New Hampshire. “Among the Isles of
Shoals,” is her most noted work in prose. She published a volume of
poems, many of which are favorites with children. She died in 1894.</p>
<p>1．Poor, sweet Piccola! Did you hear</p>
<p>What happened to Piccola, children dear?</p>
<p>’T is seldom Fortune such favor grants</p>
<p>As fell to this little maid of France.</p>
<p>2．’T was Christmas time, and her parents poor</p>
<p>Could hardly drive the wolf from the door,</p>
<p>Striving with poverty’s patient pain</p>
<p>Only to live till summer again.</p>
<p>3．No gift for Piccola! sad were they</p>
<p>When dawned (1) the morning of Christmas day!</p>
<p>Their little darling no joy might stir (2) ;</p>
<p>St. Nicholas nothing would bring to her!</p>
<p>4．But Piccola never doubted at all</p>
<p>That something beautiful must befall (3)</p>
<p>Every child upon Christmas day,</p>
<p>And so she slept till the dawn was gray.</p>
<p>5．And full of faith, when at last she woke,</p>
<p>She stole to her shoe as the morning broke;</p>
<p>Such sounds of gladness filled all the air,</p>
<p>’T was plain St. Nicholas had been there.</p>
<p>6．In rushed Piccola, sweet, half wild —</p>
<p>Never was seen such a joyful child—</p>
<p>“See what the good saint brought!” she cried,</p>
<p>And mother and father must peep inside.</p>
<p>7．Now such a story I never heard!</p>
<p>There was a little shivering (4) bird!</p>
<p>A sparrow, that in at the window flew,</p>
<p>Had crept into Piccola’s tiny (5) shoe!</p>
<p>8．“How good poor Piccola must have been!”</p>
<p>She cried, as happy as any queen,</p>
<p>While the starving sparrow she fed and warmed,</p>
<p>And danced with rapture (6) , she was so charmed (7) .</p>
<p>9．Children, this story I tell to you</p>
<p>Of Piccola sweet and her bird, is true.</p>
<p>In the far-off land of France, they say,</p>
<p>Still do they live to this very day.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is meant by “driving the wolf from the door”? In the
third stanza, what does “St.” before Nicholas mean? Who is St. Nicholas?
What did Piccola find in her shoe on Christmas morning?</p>

<p>1．可怜又可爱的皮克拉！你们是否听说</p>
<p>皮克拉发生了什么？我亲爱的孩子们？</p>
<p>从来没有什么好运气</p>
<p>能够降临到这个法国小姑娘身上。</p>
<p>2．现在正是圣诞节，她的父母很穷，</p>
<p>根本无法摆脱贫困，</p>
<p>与贫穷的痛苦抗争着，</p>
<p>只求能够活到夏天再次来临。</p>
<p>3．没有礼物给皮克拉！他们很悲伤</p>
<p>等来了圣诞节的清晨。</p>
<p>他们的小宝贝没有快乐，</p>
<p>圣诞老人没有东西带给她！</p>
<p>4．但皮克拉深信不疑，</p>
<p>她觉得肯定会有什么美好的事儿，</p>
<p>在圣诞日发生在每一个孩子身上。</p>
<p>就这样她一直睡到天蒙蒙亮。</p>
<p>5．最终醒来时，她还是充满希望。</p>
<p>天空破晓，她蹑手蹑脚走到自己的鞋子旁。</p>
<p>她欢快的声音洋溢在空气中，</p>
<p>很显然圣诞老人来过这里。</p>
<p>6．皮克拉冲过去，内心甜美而又几近疯狂</p>
<p>从没见过这样快乐的孩子——</p>
<p>她惊叫：“瞧瞧最好的圣诞老人给我带来了什么！”</p>
<p>她的爸爸妈妈从里面偷偷地看。</p>
<p>7．接下来的这件事我从来没听说过。</p>
<p>有一只冻得瑟瑟发抖的小鸟儿！</p>
<p>从窗户飞进来的一只麻雀，</p>
<p>爬进了皮克拉的小鞋子！</p>
<p>8．“可怜的皮克拉肯定特别乖！”</p>
<p>她喊叫着，像女王一样快乐。</p>
<p>她把奄奄一息的麻雀喂得饱饱的，捂得暖暖和和的，</p>
<p>高兴地跳着舞，她看起来那么可爱迷人。</p>
<p>9．孩子们，我给你们讲的这个</p>
<p>关于可爱的皮克拉和她的鸟儿的故事是真的。</p>
<p>人们说，在遥远的法国土地上，</p>
<p>她们一直生活到了今天。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-14-true-manliness">LESSON 14 TRUE MANLINESS</h2>
<p>真正的男子气概</p>
<p>1．“Please, mother, do sit down and let me try my hand,” said Fred
Liscom, a bright, active boy twelve years old. Mrs. Liscom, looking pale
and worn, was moving languidly (1) about, trying to clear away the
breakfast she had scarcely tasted.</p>
<p>2．She smiled, and said, “You, Fred, you wash dishes?” “Yes, indeed,
mother,” replied Fred; “I should be a poor scholar if I couldn’t, when
I’ve seen you do it so many times. Just try me.”</p>
<p>3．A look of relief came over his mother’s face as she seated herself
in her low rocking-chair. Fred washed the dishes, and put them in the
closet. He then swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the
cellar for the dinner and washed them, and then set out for school.</p>
<p>4．Fred’s father was away from home, and as there was some cold meat
in the pantry, Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred
hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the
dishes.</p>
<p>5．He kept on in this way for two or three days, till his mother was
able to resume her usual work, and he felt amply (2) rewarded when the
doctor, who happened in one day, said, “Well, madam, it’s my opinion (3)
that you would have been very sick if you had not kept quiet.”</p>
<p>6．The doctor did not know how the “quiet” had been secured, nor how
the boy’s heart bounded at his words. Fred had given up a great deal of
what boys hold dear, for the purpose of helping his mother, coasting and
skating being just at this time in perfection.</p>
<p>7．Besides this, his temper and his patience had been severely tried.
He had been in the habit of going early to school, and staying to play
after it was dismissed.</p>
<p>8．The boys missed him, and their curiosity was excited when he would
give no other reason for not coming to school earlier, or staying after
school, than that he was “wanted at home.” “I’ll tell you,” said Tom
Barton, “I’ll find him out, boys—see if I don’t!”</p>
<p>9．So he called for Fred to go to school, and on his way to the side
door walked lightly and somewhat nearer the kitchen window than was
absolutely (4) needful. Looking in, he saw Fred standing at the table
with a dishcloth in his hand.</p>
<p>10．Of course he reported this at school, and various were the
greetings poor Fred received at recess. “Well, you’re a brave one to
stay at home washing dishes.” “Girl boy!” “Pretty Bessie!” “Lost your
apron, have n’t you, Polly!”</p>
<p>11．Fred was not wanting either in spirit or courage, and he was
strongly tempted to resent (5) these insults and to fight some of his
tormentors. But his consciousness (6) of right and his love for his
mother helped him.</p>
<p>12．While he was struggling for self mastery, his teacher appeared at
the door of the schoolhouse. Fred caught his eye, and it seemed to look,
if it did not say, “Don’t give up! Be really brave!” He knew the teacher
had heard the insulting taunts of his thoughtless schoolmates.</p>
<p>13．The boys received notice during the day that Fred must not be
taunted or teased in any manner. They knew that the teacher meant what
he said; and so the brave little boy had no farther trouble.</p>
<p>(Mrs. M. O. Johnson)</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Why did Fred offer to wash the dishes? Was it a
disgraceful thing to do? How was he rewarded? How did his schoolmates
show their lack of manliness?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-254">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．“妈妈，求您了，快坐下吧，让我试试。”这个阳光、积极的12岁孩子弗雷德·利斯科姆说。利斯科姆夫人脸色苍白，看起来很疲倦，她虚弱地挪动着，正要收拾餐桌上她基本没吃几口的早饭。</p>
<p>2．她笑着说：“弗雷德，你，你来洗碗吗？”弗雷德说：“没错，是的，妈妈。我看您洗碗那么多次了，要是还没学会，我就是个笨学生了。让我试试吧。”</p>
<p>3．母亲慢慢地坐到矮矮的摇椅上，看起来如释重负。弗雷德洗好碗，把它们放在橱柜里。接着，他又清扫了厨房，从地窖里取出土豆，把它们洗净，准备晚饭时用，一切做好后，他这才去上学。</p>
<p>4．弗雷德的父亲不在家。家里储藏柜里有些冻肉，利斯科姆夫人觉得做晚饭还比较轻松。弗雷德一放学就赶忙回家，布置餐桌，饭后又洗了碗。</p>
<p>5．他这么做了两三天，直到他母亲能够自己动手干活。医生有一天对她说：“哎呀，女士，我觉得如果不是这两天您能安心静养，很可能会病得很重。”听到这，弗雷德觉得受了极大的褒奖。</p>
<p>6．医生不知道他的母亲是如何做到静养，也不知道这男孩心里把他的话看得多重要。弗雷德为了帮助他的母亲，放弃了很多男孩们都想做的事，比如当时最受欢迎的沿海滑行和滑冰。</p>
<p>7．除此之外，他的脾气和耐心也经历了不小的考验。以前他总是很早去学校，放学后在学校玩耍好一会儿。</p>
<p>8．他的伙伴很想念他，当他就“没法早点到学校了，没法放学后在学校逗留”给出的原因仅仅是“家里需要我”时，激起了伙伴们的好奇心。汤姆·巴顿说：“我会找到原因的，伙计们，看我的吧！”</p>
<p>9．第二天汤姆上学时路过弗雷德家，快到旁门时他蹑手蹑脚地走过去，走到离厨房窗户非常近的地方。他朝里一看，看见弗雷德站在餐桌旁，手里拿着一块抹布。</p>
<p>10．他当然把这些告诉了学校的男孩子们。弗雷德在课间休息时受到了各种各样的嘲讽：“真有勇气，待在家里洗碗！”“真女气！”“漂亮的贝西小姑娘！”“你围裙丢了吧，哈哈，波利！”</p>
<p>11．弗雷德不缺乏志气和勇气，他对这些侮辱的话非常不满，也很有冲动和这些家伙们打一架。但是，他内心的理智和他对他母亲的爱让他没有这么做。</p>
<p>12．正当他内心挣扎着克制自己，老师出现在教室门口。弗雷德和他对视了一下，虽然他的眼神没有说，但至少看起来仿佛在说：“别放弃，做到真正的勇敢！”他知道老师肯定听到那些没心没肺的同学们嘲笑他的话了。</p>
<p>13．那天，老师告诫男孩们不许再以任何方式嘲笑或者嘲弄弗雷德。他们知道老师是认真的，所以勇敢的小男孩弗雷德没有再遇到麻烦。</p>

MANLINESS（CONCLUDED）</h2>
<p>真正的男子气概（结束篇）</p>
<p>1．“Fire! fire!” The cry crept out on the still night air, and the
fire bells began to ring. Fred was wakened by the alarm and the red
light streaming into his room. He dressed himself in a moment, almost,
and tapped at the door of his mother’s bedroom.</p>
<p>2．“It is Mr. Barton’s house, mother. Do let me go,” he said in
eager, excited tones. Mrs. Liscom thought a moment. He was young, but
she could trust him, and she knew how much his heart was in the
request.</p>
<p>3．“Yes, you may go,” she answered; “but be careful, my boy. If you
can help, do so; but do nothing rashly.” Fred promised to follow her
advice, and hurried to the fire.</p>
<p>4．Mr. and Mrs. Barton were not at home. The house had been left in
charge of the servants. The fire spread with fearful speed, for there
was a high wind, and it was found impossible to save the house. The
servants ran about, screaming and lamenting, but doing nothing to any
purpose.</p>
<p>5．Fred found Tom outside, in safety. “Where is Katy?” he asked. Tom,
trembling with terror, seemed to have had no thought but of his own
escape. He said, “Katy is in the house!” “In what room?” asked Fred. “In
that one,” pointing to a window in the upper story.</p>
<p>6．It was no time for words, but for instant, vigorous action. The
staircase was already on fire; there was but one way to reach Katy, and
that full of danger. The second floor might fall at any moment, and Fred
knew it. But he trusted in an arm stronger than his own, and silently
sought help and guidance.</p>
<p>7．A ladder was quickly brought, and placed against the house. Fred
mounted it, followed by the hired man, dashed in the sash of the window,
and pushed his way into the room where the poor child lay nearly
suffocated with smoke.</p>
<p>8．He roused her with some difficulty, carried her to the window, and
placed her upon the sill. She was instantly grasped by strong arms, and
carried down the ladder, Fred following as fast as possible. They had
scarcely reached the ground before a crash of falling timbers told them
that they had barely escaped with their lives.</p>
<p>9．Tom Barton never forgot the lesson of that night; and he came to
believe, and to act upon the belief, in after years, that true manliness
is in harmony with gentleness, kindness, and self-denial.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Relate the story of the fire. What is meant by “to any
purpose,” in paragraph four? Did Fred show any lack of manliness when
tested? What does this lesson teach?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-255">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．“着火啦！着火啦！”惊呼声划破了寂静的夜空，火灾报警声随后鸣叫起来。弗雷德被警笛声惊醒了，红色的火光朝着他的房间逼近。他迅速穿上衣服，几乎同时敲响他母亲卧室的门。</p>
<p>2．“是巴顿先生的房子着火了，妈妈。让我去帮忙吧！”他用急切而又激动的语气说道。利斯科姆夫人想了一下。虽然他还小，但母亲信任他，而且她也知道弗雷德心里很渴望能去。</p>
<p>3．“好的，你去吧！”利斯科姆夫人说，“但是，一定要小心啊，我的孩子。如果你能帮上忙，就去帮，但千万不要冲动。”弗雷德保证会听从母亲的建议，匆忙冲向火场。</p>
<p>4．巴顿夫妇不在家，仆人们照看他们的房子。当时风很大，因此火势蔓延得非常凶猛，想保住房子是不可能了。仆人们慌乱地跑来跑去，大声哭喊，任何想办法的事都没有做。</p>
<p>5．弗雷德在外面找到了汤姆，他安然无恙，他问：“凯蒂呢？”汤姆正害怕得浑身发抖，看起来他只想着自己安全逃出来，别的什么都没想。他说：“凯蒂还在屋里呢。”“在哪个房间？”弗雷德问。汤姆指着楼上的窗户说：“就是那间。”</p>
<p>6．没时间多说了，只能立刻采取有力行动。楼梯已经着火了，只有一条路能救凯蒂，而这条路危险重重。二楼的地板随时可能掉下来，弗雷德知道这一点。但是，他信任那些比自己更有力气的大人，然后轻声去寻求帮助和引导。</p>
<p>7．人们很快拿来一个梯子，靠着房子外墙立了起来。弗雷德爬上梯子，后面跟着雇来的人，快速爬到窗户边，钻到房间里。那可怜的凯蒂正躺在床上，被浓烟呛得快要窒息了。</p>
<p>8．他艰难地把她抱起来，抱到窗户边，放在窗台上。她随即被一双强有力的臂膀紧紧抱住，沿着梯子爬了下去。弗雷德以最快的速度紧跟其后。他们刚一落地，就听到木头掉落的撞击声，这说明刚刚他们死里逃生。</p>
<p>9．汤姆·巴顿永远忘不了那天晚上所学到的，在之后的岁月里，他开始相信，并用行动证明这一信念，那就是：真正的男子汉是温柔、善良和自我牺牲的统一。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-16-the-brown-thrush">LESSON 16 THE BROWN THRUSH</h2>
<p>棕色画眉鸟</p>
<p>Lucy Larcom, the author of the following poem, was born in 1826, and
passed many years of her life as a factory girl at Lowell, Mass. She
died in 1893.</p>
<p>1．There’s a merry brown thrush sitting up in a tree;</p>
<p>“He’s singing to me! he’s singing to me!”</p>
<p>And what does he say, little girl, little boy?</p>
<p>“Oh, the world’s running over with joy!</p>
<p>Don’t You hear? Don’t you see?</p>
<p>Hush! look! In my tree</p>
<p>I’m as happy as happy can be!”</p>
<p>2．And the brown thrush keeps singing, “A nest do you see,</p>
<p>And five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree?</p>
<p>Don’t meddle! don’t touch! little girl, little boy,</p>
<p>Or the world will lose some of its joy!</p>
<p>Now I’m glad! now I’m free!</p>
<p>And I always shall be,</p>
<p>If you never bring sorrow to me.”</p>
<p>3．So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,</p>
<p>To you and to me, to you and to me;</p>
<p>And he sings all the day, little girl, little boy,</p>
<p>“Oh, the world’s running over with joy!</p>
<p>But long it won’t be,</p>
<p>Don’t you know? Don’t you see?</p>
<p>Unless we’re as good as can be.”</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is a thrush? Why was the thrush so happy? Do you
think he would have been happy if the little boy or girl had robbed the
nest?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-256">中文阅读</h4>
<p>下面这首诗的作者是露西·拉科姆，她出生于1826年，曾经很长一段时间是马萨诸塞州罗维尔市一个工厂的女工，1893年去世。</p>
<p>1．一只欢乐的棕色画眉鸟坐在树枝头；</p>
<p>“他在对我歌唱！他在对我歌唱！”</p>
<p>小女孩，小男孩，他在说什么呢？</p>
<p>“哦，世界充满欢乐！</p>
<p>难道你听不到？难道你看不到？</p>
<p>嘘！看哪！在我的树枝头</p>
<p>我要多快乐就有多快乐！”</p>
<p>2．棕色画眉鸟不停唱：“你看到鸟巢了吗？</p>
<p>看到我藏在杜松子树上的五个鸟蛋了吗？</p>
<p>别捣乱！别胡摸！小女孩，小男孩。</p>
<p>不然世界的欢乐就会减少一些。</p>
<p>现在我很快乐！现在我很自由！</p>
<p>我将永远如此。</p>
<p>只要你们不给我带来悲伤。”</p>
<p>3．所以这只欢乐的棕色画眉鸟总是在枝头歌唱，</p>
<p>对你唱也对我唱，对你唱也对我唱；</p>
<p>他整天都在唱，小女孩，小男孩，</p>
<p>“哦，这世界充满着欢乐！</p>
<p>但这欢乐不会长久，</p>
<p>难道你不知道？难道你看不出？</p>
<p>除非我们能做多好就做多好。”</p>
<h2 id="lesson-17-a-ship-in-a-storm">LESSON 17 A SHIP IN A STORM</h2>
<p>暴风雨中的船</p>
<p>1．Did you ever go far out upon the great ocean? How beautiful it is
to be out at sea, when the sea is smooth and still!</p>
<p>2．Let a storm approach, and the scene is changed. The heavy, black
clouds appear in the distance, and throw a deep, deathlike shade over
the world of waters.</p>
<p>3．The captain and sailors soon see in the clouds the signs of evil.
All hands are then set to work to take in sail.</p>
<p>4．The hoarse notes of the captain, speaking through his trumpet, are
echoed (1) from lip to lip among the rigging. Happy will it be, if all
is made snug before the gale (2) strikes the vessel.</p>
<p>5．At last, the gale comes like a vast moving mountain of air. It
strikes the ship. The vessel heaves (3) and groans under the dreadful
weight, and struggles to escape through the foaming waters.</p>
<p>6．If she is far out at sea, she will be likely to ride out the storm
in safety. But if the wind is driving her upon the shore, the poor
sailors will hardly escape being dashed upon the rocks, and drowned.</p>
<p>7．Once there was a ship in a storm. Some of her masts were already
broken, and her sails lost. While the wind was raging, and the billows
(4) were dashing against her, the cry was heard, “A man has fallen
overboard!”</p>
<p>8．Quickly was the boat lowered, and she was soon seen bounding on
her way over the mountain waves. At one moment, the boat seemed lifted
to the skies, and the next, it sank down, and appeared to be lost
beneath the waves!</p>
<p>9．At length, the man was found. He was well nigh drowned; but he was
taken on board, and now they made for the ship. But the ship rolled so
dreadfully, that it seemed certain death to go near her. And now, what
should they do?</p>
<p>10．The captain told one of the men to go aloft and throw down a
rope. This was made fast to the boat, and when the sea was somewhat calm
it was hoisted, and all fell down into the ship with a dreadful crash.
It was a desperate (5) way of getting on board; but fortunately no lives
were lost.</p>
<p>11．On the dangerous points along our seacoast are lighthouses, which
can be seen far out at sea, and serve as guides to ships. Sometimes the
fog (6) is so dense that these lights can not be seen, but most
lighthouses have great fog bells or fog horns; some of the latter are
made to sound by steam, and can be heard for a long distance. These
bells and horns are kept sounding as long as the fog lasts.</p>
<p>12．There are also many life-saving stations along the coast where
trained men are ready with lifeboats. “When a ship is driven ashore they
at once go to the rescue of those on board, and thus many valuable lives
are saved.</p>
<p>13．Take it all in all, a sailor’s life is a very hard one. Our young
friends owe a debt of gratitude (7) to those whose home is upon the
great waters, and who bring them the luxuries (8) of other
countries.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is this lesson about? When is it dangerous to be at
sea? What do sailors then do? In what situation are they most likely to
be saved? Relate the story of the man overboard. Tell about the
lighthouses. How are vessels warned of danger in a fog? What about the
life-saving stations? What is said of a sailor’s life?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-257">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．你是否曾经在大海上远航？风平浪静时出海，这是多么美好的景象！</p>
<p>2．风暴一旦来临，这样的场景就变了。厚重的乌云压过来，四周水的世界笼罩着阴暗的死亡一般的阴影。</p>
<p>3．船长和水手很快就看到了乌云中不祥的迹象。所有人手都被派去把船帆收起来。</p>
<p>4．船长用扩音器大叫着，嘶哑的声音和呼喊在绳索间回响。如果在一阵猛烈的海风席卷船身前能够把一切准备妥当，他们就会很高兴地松口气。</p>
<p>5．最后，暴风像一座巨大的空气山移过来了，猛烈撞击着船身。轮船上下起伏，在重压下发出咯吱咯吱的声音，挣扎着想要逃脱这波涛汹涌的水域。</p>
<p>6．如果船航行在大海的中央，还有可能安全度过风暴。但是，如果暴风把船推向岸边，可怜的水手们就很难逃脱被甩向岩石、溺水身亡的厄运。</p>
<p>7．曾经有艘船遭遇了风暴，船上的一些桅杆已经折断了，船帆也不知去向。狂风肆虐，海浪不断涌来，拍打船身，只听见一声叫喊：“有人从船上掉到海里啦！”</p>
<p>8．人们迅速从大船上放下一只小船，它转眼间就被推上浪尖。这一刻，小船好像被推向天空，下一刻，它又沉下来，仿佛要消失在巨浪下面！</p>
<p>9．最后，终于找到了落水的人。他差点儿就被淹死了，幸好被救上了小船。接着他们要启程返回轮船。但是，轮船上下起伏，摇晃得厉害，接近它似乎是自取灭亡。这时候，他们又能做什么呢？</p>
<p>10．船长告诉其中一名船员，让他从高处扔下一条绳子。绳子一端紧紧地系在小船上，等海面稍一平静，把小船用绳子提起来。随着巨大的撞击声，连船带人一起猛地掉落在轮船上。这是近乎绝望的收船方式，但很幸运无人丧生。</p>
<p>11．在海岸的险要地点都设有灯塔，从海上很远的地方就能看到，它们是海上船只的路标。有时候雾霾过于严重，从远处看不到灯塔发出的光，不过大部分灯塔都有很大的雾钟或者雾笛。有些雾笛是用蒸汽驱动的，从很远就能听到。只要雾霾持续，雾钟和雾笛就会响个不停。</p>
<p>12．在海岸线还有很多救生站，受过训练的救生员准备好救生艇随时待命。有船被海浪冲上岸的时候，他们立刻去救援，营救甲板上的船员，拯救了很多宝贵的生命。</p>
<p>13．总而言之，水手们的生活异常艰辛。我们这些年轻人应该向那些常年漂在海上、以海为家的人们致敬，是他们为我们带来国外的珍稀物品。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-19-two-ways-of-telling-a-story">LESSON 19 TWO WAYS OF
TELLING A STORY</h2>
<p>讲述故事的两种方式</p>
<p>1．In one of the most populous (1) cities of New England, a few years
ago, a party of lads, all members of the same school, got up a grand
sleigh ride. The sleigh was a very large one, drawn by six gray
horses.</p>
<p>2．On the following day, as the teacher entered the schoolroom, he
found his pupils in high glee, as they chattered about the fun and
frolic of their excursion (2) . In answer to some inquiries, one of the
lads gave him an account of their trip and its various incidents (3)
.</p>
<p>3．As he drew near the end of his story, he exclaimed: “Oh, sir!
there was one thing I had almost forgotten. As we were coming home, we
saw ahead of us a queer looking affair in the road. It proved to be a
rusty old sleigh, fastened behind a covered wagon, proceeding at a very
slow rate, and taking up the whole road.</p>
<p>4．“Finding that the owner was not disposed to turn out, we
determined upon a volley of snowballs and a good hurrah. They produced
the right effect, for the crazy machine turned out into the deep snow,
and the skinny old pony started on a full trot.</p>
<p>5．“As we passed, some one gave the horse a good crack, which made
him run faster than he ever did before, I’ll warrant (4) .</p>
<p>6．“With that, an old fellow in the wagon, who was buried up under an
old hat, bawled out, ‘Why do you frighten my horse?’ ‘Why don’t you turn
out, then?’ says the driver. So we gave him three rousing cheers more.
His horse was frightened again, and ran up against a loaded wagon, and,
I believe, almost capsized (5) the old creature—and so we left him.”</p>
<p>7．“Well, boys,” replied the teacher, “take your seat”, and I will
tell you a story, and all about a sleigh ride, too. Yesterday afternoon
a very venerable (6) old clergyman was on his way from Boston to Salem,
to pass the rest of the winter at the house of his son. That he might be
prepared for journeying in the following spring he took with him his
wagon, and for the winter his sleigh, which he fastened behind the
wagon.</p>
<p>8．“His sight and hearing were somewhat blunted (7) by age, and he
was proceeding very slowly; for his horse was old and feeble, like his
owner. He was suddenly disturbed by loud hurrahs from behind, and by a
furious pelting of balls of snow and ice upon the top of his wagon.</p>
<p>9．“In his alarm he dropped his reins, and his horse began to run
away. In the midst of the old man’s trouble, there rushed by him, with
loud shouts, a large party of boys, in a sleigh drawn by six horses.
‘Turn out! turn out, old fellow!’ ‘Give us the road!’ ‘What will you
take for your pony?’ ‘What’s the price of oats, old man?’ were the
various cries that met his cars.</p>
<p>10．“‘Pray, do not frighten my horse!’ exclaimed the infirm driver.
‘Turn out, then! turn out!’ was the answer, which was followed by
repeated cracks and blows from the long whip of the ‘grand sleigh,’ with
showers of snowballs, and three tremendous hurrahs from the boys.</p>
<p>11．“The terror of the old man and his horse was increased, and the
latter ran away with him, to the great danger of his life. He contrived,
however, to stop his horse just in season to prevent his being dashed
against a loaded wagon. A short distance brought him to the house of his
son. That son, boys, is your instructor, and that ‘old fellow,’ was your
teacher’s father!”</p>
<p>12．When the boys perceived how rude and unkind their conduct
appeared from another point of view, they were very much ashamed of
their thoughtlessness, and most of them had the manliness to apologize
to their teacher for what they had done.</p>
<p>(Henry K. Oliver )</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Repeat the boys’ story of the sleigh ride. The teacher’s
story. Were the boys ill-natured or only thoughtless? Is thoughtlessness
any excuse for rudeness or unkindness?</p>

<p>1．很多年前，在新英格兰一个人口最多的城市里，有一群来自同一所学校的少年，他们坐上了一辆大雪橇。雪橇非常大，由六匹灰色的骏马拉着。</p>
<p>2．第二天，老师到教室后，发现他的学生们情绪非常高昂，都在不停谈论着雪橇之旅的好玩和有趣之处。为回答老师的询问，其中一个小伙子讲述了他们那趟旅行中发生的所有事情。</p>
<p>3．他的故事快要讲完时，他大叫：“对了，先生！有件事我差点忘了。回来的路上，我看到在我们前面有个奇怪的东西。后来证实那是一个老旧的雪橇，都生锈了，系在一辆有篷马车后面，行进速度特别慢，把整条路都堵上了。</p>
<p>4．“我们发现马车的主人不打算让路，就决定一起朝他扔雪球，一起大叫起哄。后来确实起了作用，那辆不正常的马车陷在厚厚的积雪里，拉车的干瘦老马开始小跑起来。</p>
<p>5．“我们超过他们时，有人朝马打了个响指，它狂奔起来，我保证，比它以往任何时候跑得都快。</p>
<p>6．“就这样，马车里有个老人，他带着一顶旧旧的帽子，大叫着说：‘你们为什么吓唬我的马？’’那你为什么不让路呢？’我们的马夫说。这样我们又起了三次哄。他的马又被吓坏了，朝着一辆满载的马车冲去，我觉得，肯定把那辆老马车弄翻了。就这样我们离开了他。”</p>
<p>7．“请坐下，我的孩子。”老师说着，“我也给你讲个故事，也是关于坐雪橇的。昨天下午，一个德高望重的老牧师从波士顿赶往塞伦，去他儿子家度过冬天。他大概是准备要在来年春天去旅行，所以他驾驶着自己的马车。为了适应冬天需要，还带了雪橇，绑在了马车后面。</p>
<p>8．“由于上了年纪，他的耳朵和眼睛都不好使了，所以他走得特别慢。因为他的马就跟主人一样，已是年老体衰。在路上，他突然被后面的大声惊呼吓着了，接着是雪球和冰块，猛烈地击打在他的马车上。</p>
<p>9．“受惊之后，缰绳脱手了，他的马开始乱跑。就在老人面对一堆麻烦时，一群男孩子，他们坐着六匹马拉着的雪橇，大叫着从他旁边经过，他们大喊‘闪开！闪开！老家伙！’‘把路让开！’‘你的破马算什么！’’你这燕麦值多少钱啊，老家伙？’类似的叫喊声传到他的马车里。</p>
<p>10．“’嘿，别吓坏我的马！’这年迈的马夫说着。’那你让开，让开！’他们回答，然后从巨大雪橇上不停传来鞭打声和口哨声，一阵阵雪球像雨滴不断袭来。男孩们还起了三次哄。</p>
<p>11．“老人和马受了更大的惊吓，马儿干脆就带着他跑了起来，这对他是十分危险的。不过，他还是设法让马停了下来，这样才没撞上一辆满载货物的马车。离那儿没多远就到了他儿子家。他的儿子，我的学生们啊，就是你们的老师。而那个老家伙，正是你们老师的父亲！”</p>
<p>12．孩子们从另一个角度意识到他们的举动是多么的粗鲁和不友善，他们为自己的无所顾忌感到非常羞愧。他们中的大部分都敢于担当地向老师道了歉。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-20-freaks-of-the-frost">LESSON 20 FREAKS OF THE
FROST</h2>
<p>霜之奇想</p>
<p>By Hannah Flagg Gould, who was born at Lancaster, Vermont, in 1789.
She published several volumes of poems (one for children) and one
collection of prose articles, entitled “Gathered Leaves.” She died in
1865.</p>
<p>1．The Frost looked forth one still, clear night,</p>
<p>And whispered, “Now I shall be out of sight;</p>
<p>So through the valley and over the height</p>
<p>In silence I’ll take my way;</p>
<p>I will not go on, like that blustering (1) train,</p>
<p>The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,</p>
<p>Who make so much bustle (2) and noise in vain,</p>
<p>But I’ll be as busy as they.”</p>
<p>2．Then he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest (3) ;</p>
<p>He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed</p>
<p>In diamond beads; and over the breast</p>
<p>Of the quivering (4) lake, he spread</p>
<p>A coat of mail, that it need not fear</p>
<p>The downward point of many a spear,</p>
<p>That he hung on its margin (5) , far and near,</p>
<p>Where a rock could rear its head.</p>
<p>3．He went to the windows of those who slept,</p>
<p>And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;</p>
<p>Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,</p>
<p>By the light of the morn were seen</p>
<p>Most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees;</p>
<p>There were bevies (6) of birds, and swarms of bees;</p>
<p>There were cities with temples and towers, and these</p>
<p>All pictured (7) in silver sheen (8) .</p>
<p>4．But he did one thing that was hardly fair;</p>
<p>He peeped in the cupboard, and, finding there</p>
<p>That all had forgotten for him to prepare,</p>
<p>“Now just to set them a-thinking,</p>
<p>I’ll bite this basket of fruit,” said he,</p>
<p>“This costly pitcher I’ll burst in three;</p>
<p>And the glass of water they’ve left for me</p>
<p>Shall ‘tchick’! to tell them I’m drinking.”</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What did the frost say? What did he do to the mountain?
The trees? The lake? Whatis a “coat of mail”? What did he do to the
window? The pitcher?</p>

<p>1．在一个宁静、清冷的夜里，霜向前看着，</p>
<p>低声说：“现在肯定没人看到我；</p>
<p>所以我要穿过深谷，越过高山，</p>
<p>我将悄悄地启程；</p>
<p>我不会像喧闹的火车一样前行，</p>
<p>也不像狂风和大雪，冰雹和大雨，</p>
<p>它们白白制造了那么多喧闹和噪音，</p>
<p>不过我会像它们一样忙碌的。”</p>
<p>2．接着它飞向高山，给山峰扑粉。</p>
<p>它落在树上，让它们的枝头布满</p>
<p>钻石般的珠子；它停在湖水</p>
<p>那颤抖的胸口，为它布满盔甲</p>
<p>它再不必害怕</p>
<p>长矛的戳戳点点。</p>
<p>然后它挂在石头的边缘，</p>
<p>覆盖周围石头裸露在外的地方。</p>
<p>3．它跑到那些熟睡的人们的窗户上，</p>
<p>像小仙女一般爬满每一扇窗格的玻璃上；</p>
<p>每一个它呼吸的地方，每一个它停留的所在</p>
<p>都被早晨的朝阳看在眼里</p>
<p>最美丽的一切，花朵和树木；</p>
<p>群鸟、蜜蜂；</p>
<p>城市的寺庙和高塔，这一切</p>
<p>披上了银装素裹。</p>
<p>4．但有一件事，它做得不公平；</p>
<p>它向橱柜里偷偷瞥去，发现在那儿</p>
<p>所有的一切都忘记为它准备了，“给他们点教训看看，</p>
<p>我要咬篮子里的水果，”它说着，</p>
<p>“这个昂贵的水罐，我要让它裂成三份；</p>
<p>他们给我留的这杯水</p>

<h2 id="lesson-21-waste-not-want-not">LESSON 21 WASTE NOT, WANT NOT</h2>
<p>不浪费，不愁缺</p>
<p>1．Mr. Jones. Boys, if you have nothing to do, will you unpack these
parcels for me?</p>
<p>2．The two parcels were exactly alike, both of them well tied up with
good whipcord. Ben took his parcel to the table, and began to examine
(1) the knot, and then to untie it.</p>
<p>3．John took the other parcel, and tried first at one corner, and
then at the other, to pull off the string. But the cord had been too
well secured, and he only drew the knots tighter.</p>
<p>4．John. I wish these people would not tie up their parcels so
tightly, as if they were never to be undone. Why, Ben, how did you get
yours undone? What is in your parcel? I wonder what is in mine! I wish I
could get the string off. I will cut it.</p>
<p>5．Ben. Oh, no, do not cut it, John! Look, what a nice cord this is,
and yours is the same. It is a pity to cut it.</p>
<p>6．John. Pooh! what signifies (2) a bit of pack thread?</p>
<p>7．Ben. It is whipcord.</p>
<p>8．John. Well, whipcord then! what signifies a bit of whipcord? You
can get a piece of whipcord twice as long as that for three cents; and
who cares for three cents? Not I, for one. So, here it goes.</p>
<p>9．So he took out his knife, and cut it in several places.</p>
<p>10．Mr. Jones. Well, my boys, have you undone the parcels for me?</p>
<p>11．John. Yes, sir; here is the parcel.</p>
<p>12．Ben. And here is my parcel, father, and here is also the
string.</p>
<p>13．Mr. Jones. You may keep the string, Ben.</p>
<p>14．Ben. Thank you, sir. What excellent whipcord it is!</p>
<p>15．Mr. Jones. And you, John, may keep your string, too, if it will
be of any use to you.</p>
<p>16．John. It will be of no use to me, thank you, sir.</p>
<p>17．Mr. Jones. No, I am afraid not, if this is it.</p>
<p>18．A few weeks after this, Mr. Jones gave each of his sons a new
top.</p>
<p>19．John. How is this, Ben? These tops have no strings. What shall we
do for strings?</p>
<p>20．Ben. I have a string that will do very well for mine. And he
pulled it out of his pocket.</p>
<p>21．John. Why, if that is not the whipcord! I wish I had saved
mine.</p>
<p>22．A few days afterward, there was a shooting match, with bows and
arrows, among the lads. The prize was a fine bow and arrows, to be given
to the best marksman (3) . “Come, come,” said Master Sharp, “I am within
one inch of the mark. I should like to see who will go nearer.”</p>
<p>23．John drew his bow, and shot. The arrow struck within a quarter of
an inch of Master Sharp’s. “Shoot away,” said Sharp; “but you must
understand the rules. We settled them before you came. You are to have
three shots with your own arrows. Nobody is to borrow or lend. So shoot
away.”</p>
<p>24．John seized his second arrow; “If I have any luck,” said he;—but
just as he pronounced the word “luck,” the string broke, and the arrow
fell from his hands.</p>
<p>25．Master Sharp. There! It is all over with you.</p>
<p>26．Ben. Here is my bow for him, and welcome.</p>
<p>27．Master Sharp. No, no, sir; that is not fair. Did you not hear the
rules? There is to be no lending.</p>
<p>28．It was now Ben’s turn to make his trial. His first arrow missed
the mark; the second was exactly as near as John’s first. Before
venturing the last arrow, Ben very prudently (4) examined the string of
his bow; and, as he pulled it to try its strength, it snapped.</p>
<p>29．Master Sharp clapped his hands and danced for joy. But his
dancing suddenly ceased (5) , when careful Ben drew out of his pocket an
excellent piece of cord, and began to tie it to the bow.</p>
<p>30．“The everlasting (6) whipcord, I declare!” cried John. “Yes,”
said Ben, “I put it in my pocket today, because I thought I might want
it.”</p>
<p>31．Ben’s last arrow won the prize; and when the bow and arrows were
handed to him, John said, “How valuable that whipcord has been to you,
Ben. I’ll take care how I waste anything hereafter.”</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is this lesson designed to teach? Which of the boys
preserved his whipcord? What good did it do him? What did the other boy
do with his? What was the consequence? What did he learn from it?</p>

<p>1．琼斯先生：
孩子们，如果你们没事的话，能不能帮我打开这些包裹呢？</p>
<p>2．这两个包裹一模一样，都用上好的鞭绳紧紧系着。本把他的包裹拿到桌子旁边，开始仔细检查绳结，然后解开了。</p>
<p>3．约翰拿着另一个包裹，最开始试图把一角解开，又试试另一角，想要把绳子拉开。但是，绳子绑得很结实，他反而把绳结拉得更紧了。</p>
<p>4．约翰：
我希望那些人没把包裹绑得这么紧，好像这包裹再也不打算打开了似的。为什么，本，你怎么打开的啊？你的包裹里是什么啊？我想知道我这里面装了什么东西。我希望能把这绳子弄开。我要割开它。</p>
<p>5．本：
唉，别，别，约翰，不要剪开！你看，这绳子多好啊，你的也是一样好。要是剪断就太可惜了。</p>
<p>6．约翰： 哎呀！一截绑包裹的绳子有什么大不了的？</p>
<p>7．本： 这可是鞭绳啊。</p>
<p>8．约翰：
好吧，鞭绳。一截鞭绳有什么用啊？三美分就能买相当于这个两倍长的鞭绳呢，三美分算什么？对我可不算什么。所以我要割了。</p>
<p>9．于是，他拿出刀来，把绳子割成了几段。</p>
<p>10．琼斯先生： 孩子们，好啦，帮我把包裹打开了吗？</p>
<p>11．约翰： 好了，父亲。包裹在这儿。</p>
<p>12．本： 这是我打开的那个，父亲。绳子也在这儿。</p>
<p>13．琼斯先生： 绳子你留着吧，本。</p>
<p>14．本： 谢谢您，父亲。这段鞭绳可真好啊！</p>
<p>15．琼斯先生： 约翰，如果绳子对你有用的话，你可以留着。</p>
<p>16．约翰： 父亲，这对我一点儿用都没有。</p>
<p>17．琼斯先生： 如果是剪成这样的，恐怕确实没什么用了。</p>
<p>18．这件事过去几周之后，琼斯先生给他两个儿子买了新陀螺。</p>
<p>19．约翰：
本，这是怎么回事啊？这些陀螺没有鞭子啊。我们用什么当鞭子啊？</p>
<p>20．本：
我有绳子，和我的陀螺刚好合适。说着他就从口袋里拿出了绳子。</p>
<p>21．约翰： 啊，这不就是那段鞭绳吗？真希望当时完整地留下我的那条。</p>
<p>22．又过了几天，在年轻小伙子间有一场弓箭射击比赛。奖品是一副上好的弓箭，奖励给最好的神箭手。夏普大师说：“看，看，我射的箭离靶心只有不到一英寸，我要看看谁还能射得更近。”</p>
<p>23．约翰拿来他的新弓，射了一把。箭落在距离夏普大师的落点只有不到四分之一英寸的地方。夏普说：“继续射。但是，你必须知道规则。我们在你来之前就定下了规则。你需要用自己的箭射三次。任何人不得借用或借出自己的弓箭。好了，接着射吧！”</p>
<p>24．约翰拿过他的第二支箭，他说：“祝福我好运吧。”——但是，刚说出“好运”，他的弓弦就断了，箭从手中掉落。</p>
<p>25．夏普： 看哪，你的比赛结束了。</p>
<p>26．本： 这是我的弓，可以给他用。来吧。</p>
<p>27．夏普：
不行，不行，先生，这可不公平。你刚才没听见规则吗？不允许借弓箭。</p>
<p>28．现在轮到本进行射击了。他第一箭没有中靶，第二箭和约翰刚才一样接近靶心。射出第三箭之前，本很小心地检查他的弓弦，然而，就在他试试弦是否绷紧时，弦断了。</p>
<p>29．夏普大师拍着手，高兴地手舞足蹈。但是，他的舞蹈突然停止了，因为本小心翼翼地从口袋里拿出了一段极好的鞭绳，开始绑在他的弓上。</p>
<p>30．“我知道，这是最好的鞭绳。”约翰大叫起来。本说：“是的，上午我把这段鞭绳放在口袋里了，因为我觉得没准儿我会用得上它。”</p>
<p>31．本的最后一箭为他赢得了奖品。他接过弓箭时，约翰说：“那段鞭绳对你来说可是太有价值了！我以后再浪费什么东西可要当心了。”</p>

<h2 id="lesson-22-jeannette-and-jo">LESSON 22 JEANNETTE AND JO</h2>
<p>珍妮特和乔</p>
<p>By Mary Mapes Dodge, who was born in New York City in 1838. She is
the editor of the “St. Nicholas” magazine, and has written many stories
for children.</p>
<p>1．Two girls I know—Jeannette and Jo,</p>
<p>And one is always moping;</p>
<p>The other lassie, come what may,</p>
<p>Is ever bravely hoping.</p>
<p>2．Beauty of face and girlish grace</p>
<p>Are theirs, for joy or sorrow;</p>
<p>Jeannette takes brightly every day,</p>
<p>And Jo dreads each to-morrow.</p>
<p>3．One early morn they watched the dawn—</p>
<p>I saw them stand together;</p>
<p>Their whole day’s sport, ’t was very plain,</p>
<p>Depended on the weather.</p>
<p>4．“’T will storm!” cried Jo. Jeannette spoke low;</p>
<p>“Yes, but’t will soon be over.”</p>
<p>And, as she spoke, the sudden shower</p>
<p>Came, beating down the clover.</p>
<p>5．“I told you so!” cried angry Jo:</p>
<p>“It always is a-raining!”</p>
<p>Then hid her face in dire despair,</p>
<p>Lamenting and complaining.</p>
<p>6．But sweet Jeannette, quite hopeful yet,—</p>
<p>I tell it to her honor,—</p>
<p>Looked up and waited till the sun</p>
<p>Came streaming in upon her.</p>
<p>7．The broken clouds sailed off in crowds,</p>
<p>Across a sea of glory.</p>
<p>Jeannette and Jo ran, laughing, in—</p>
<p>Which ends my simple story.</p>
<p>8．Joy is divine. Come storm, come shine,</p>
<p>The hopeful are the gladdest;</p>
<p>And doubt and dread, children, believe</p>
<p>Of all things are the saddest.</p>
<p>9．In morning’s light, let youth be bright;</p>
<p>Take in the sunshine tender;</p>
<p>Then, at the close, shall life’s decline</p>
<p>Be full of sunset splendor.</p>
<p>10．And ye who fret, try, like Jeannette,</p>
<p>To shun all weak complaining;</p>
<p>And not, like Jo, cry out too soon—</p>
<p>“It always is a-raining!”</p>

<p>作者玛丽·梅普斯·道奇，1838年出生于纽约市。她曾任《圣尼古拉斯》杂志编辑，为儿童写了很多故事。</p>
<p>1．我认识两个女孩——珍妮特和乔，</p>
<p>一个总是愁眉苦脸；</p>
<p>另一个小姑娘，无论发生什么，</p>
<p>总是坚强地充满期待。</p>
<p>2．美丽的脸庞和少女的优雅</p>
<p>她们都具备。无论欢乐或是悲伤；</p>
<p>珍妮特每天总是欢快地接受，</p>
<p>而乔总对明天唉声叹气。</p>
<p>3．一天早晨，她们一起看着黎明到来——</p>
<p>我看到她们并肩而立；</p>
<p>她们一天的活动，完完全全，</p>
<p>要视天气而定。</p>
<p>4．乔喊道：“暴风雨要来了！”而珍妮特轻声说：</p>
<p>“是的，但很快就会过去的。”</p>
<p>话音未落，大雨瓢泼，</p>
<p>突然落下，把苜蓿（三叶草）都打弯了。</p>
<p>5．“我告诉过你的！”愤怒的乔大声喊道，</p>
<p>“总是下雨！”</p>
<p>然后掩藏起脸上极度绝望的神情，</p>
<p>不停地痛惜和抱怨。</p>
<p>6．但可爱的珍妮特呢，仍然充满希望，</p>
<p>连我都为她自豪，</p>
<p>她抬起头等待着，直到太阳</p>
<p>把光芒照在她身上。</p>
<p>7．云朵很快成群离去，</p>
<p>越过了壮丽的大海。</p>
<p>珍妮特和乔跑着，欢笑着，</p>
<p>我的简单故事到此结束了。</p>
<p>8．欢乐是上天的恩赐。无论风暴，无论阳光。</p>
<p>充满希望的人总是最快乐的。</p>
<p>忧心忡忡、充满畏惧的孩子，相信</p>
<p>一切都是最糟糕的。</p>
<p>9．每一个早晨，让青春闪耀。</p>
<p>看那阳光温暖地照耀，</p>
<p>而生命行将结束时，生命的谢幕</p>
<p>也应充满着落日的光辉。</p>
<p>10．那些忧愁烦恼的人啊，学学珍妮特吧，</p>
<p>避免一切无谓的抱怨。</p>
<p>而不是像乔一样，急于叫喊——</p>
<p>“总是下雨！”</p>
<h2 id="lesson-23-the-lion">LESSON 23 THE LION</h2>
<p>狮子</p>
<p>1．The lion is often called the “king of beasts,” His height varies
from three to four feet, and he is from six to nine feet long. His coat
is of it yellowish brown or tawny color, and about his neck is a great
shaggy mane which gives his head a majestic (1) appearance.</p>
<p>2．The strength of the lion is so great that he can easily crush the
skulls of such animals as the horse or ox with one blow of his paw. No
one who has not seen the teeth of a full grown lion taken out of their
sockets can have any idea of their real size; one of them forms a good
handful, and might easily be mistaken for a small elephant’s tooth.</p>
<p>3．The home of the lion is in the forests of Asia and Africa, where
he is a terror to man and beast. He generally lies concealed during the
day, but as darkness comes on he prowls (2) about where other animals
are accustomed to go for food or drink, and springs upon them unawares
(3) , with a roar that sounds like the rumble (4) of thunder.</p>
<p>4．The lion sometimes lives to a great age. One by the name of Pompey
died at London, in the year 1760, at the age of seventy years. If taken
when young the lion can be tamed, and will even show marks of kindness
to his keeper.</p>
<p>5．In a menagerie (5) at Brussels, there was a cell where a large
lion, called Danco, used to be kept. The cell happened to be in need of
repair, and the keeper, whose name was William, desired a carpenter to
come and mend it. The carpenter came, but was so afraid of the lion,
that he would not go near the cell alone.</p>
<p>6．So William entered the cell, and led the lion to the upper part of
it, while the other part was refitting (6) . He played with the lion for
some time; but, at last, being wearied, both he and the lion fell
asleep. The carpenter went on with his work, and when he had finished he
called out for William to come and see it.</p>
<p>7．He called again and again, but no William answered. The poor
carpenter began to be frightened, lest the lion had made his dinner of
the keeper, or else crushed him with his great paws. He crept round to
the upper part of the cell, and there, looking through the railing, he
saw the lion and William sleeping side by side as contentedly as two
little brothers.</p>
<p>8．He was so astonished that he uttered a loud cry. The lion,
awakened by the noise, stared at the carpenter with an eye of fury, and
then placing his paw on the breast of his keeper, as if to say, “Touch
him if you dare,” the heroic (7) beast lay down to sleep again. The
carpenter was dreadfully alarmed, and, not knowing how he could rouse
William, he ran out and related what he had seen.</p>
<p>9．Some people came, and, opening the door of the cell, contrived to
awaken the keeper, who, rubbing his eyes, quietly looked around him, and
expressed himself very well satisfied with his nap. He took the lion’s
paw, shook it kindly, and then retired uninjured from the cell.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Describe the lion’s appearance. What is said of his
strength? His teeth? Describe the lion’s home and habits. To what age do
lions live? Can they be tamed? Relate the story about the lion
Danco.</p>

<p>1．狮子通常被称作“百兽之王”。身高从三英尺到四英尺不等，身长六到九英尺长。它披着棕黄色或黄褐色的皮毛，颈部一圈蓬松的鬃毛，让它的头看起来非常雄壮威武。</p>
<p>2．狮子的力量很大，爪子一挥就能轻松击碎像马和牛一样的动物的头颅。要不是亲眼见，真无法想象一只成年狮子从牙槽里拿出来的牙齿有多大。其中一个非常大，很容易让人误认为是小象的牙齿。</p>
<p>3．狮子的家在亚洲和非洲的丛林里，在那里，它对人类和野兽都是一个威胁。白天，狮子通常只是躲藏在隐蔽的地方，伴随着夜幕降临，它悄悄踱步到其他动物惯于觅食或饮水的地方，然后出其不意跳到它们身上，发出如雷鸣般的吼叫声。</p>
<p>4．有时候，狮子可以活很大的年纪。1760年，在伦敦一头叫作庞培的狮子死去，终年70岁。如果捕捉年幼的狮子，可以进行驯养，它甚至还会对主人表现得很友好。</p>
<p>5．在布鲁塞尔的一家动物园，曾经在一个小笼子里养着一只叫丹科的狮子。那笼子当时恰好需要修缮，饲养员名叫威廉，想请一名木匠修理笼子。木匠来后，因为很害怕狮子，不敢独自靠近笼子。</p>
<p>6．所以威廉先走进笼子，把狮子引到笼子的上层，这样可以修理下面的部分。他和狮子玩耍了一会儿，但最后他们累了，他和狮子都睡着了。木匠继续工作，修完之后，他叫威廉过来看看。</p>
<p>7．他叫了一遍又一遍，但威廉没有回答。可怜的木匠开始害怕了，生怕狮子把饲养员当了晚餐，或者用它的大爪子把饲养员碾碎了。他爬到笼子的上层，通过栏杆向里看去，他看到狮子和威廉并排熟睡着，就像两个亲兄弟。</p>
<p>8．木匠大惊失色，惊叫起来。狮子被他的声音吵醒了，愤怒地瞪着木匠，把爪子轻放在饲养员的胸脯上，仿佛在说：“你敢碰他一下。”英勇的猛兽又躺下接着睡了。木匠非常害怕，又不知道怎么叫醒威廉，他跑出去和大家讲述他看到的情形。</p>
<p>9．有人过来打开了笼门，把饲养员叫醒了。饲养员揉揉眼睛，静静地环视了四周，表示他对刚才的小憩很满意。然后，他抓起狮子的爪子，友好地握了手，毫发无损地从笼子里出来了。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-24-strawberries">LESSON 24 STRAWBERRIES</h2>
<p>草莓</p>
<p>By John Townsend Trowbridge, who was born at Ogden, N. Y., in 1827.
He is a well-known author, and has written much for children both in
poetry and prose.</p>
<p>1．Little Pearl Honeydew, six years old,</p>
<p>From her bright ear parted the curls of gold;</p>
<p>And laid her head on the strawberry bed,</p>
<p>To hear what the red-cheeked berries said.</p>
<p>2．Their cheeks were blushing, their breath was sweet,</p>
<p>She could almost hear their little hearts beat;</p>
<p>And the tiniest, lisping, whispering sound</p>
<p>That ever you heard, came up from the ground.</p>
<p>3．“Little friends,” she said, “I wish I knew</p>
<p>How it is you thrive (1) on sun and dew!”</p>
<p>And this is the story the berries told</p>
<p>To little Pearl Honeydew, six years old.</p>
<p>4．“You wish you knew? And so do we.</p>
<p>But we can’t tell you, unless it be</p>
<p>That the same Kind Power that cares for you</p>
<p>Takes care of poor little berries, too.</p>
<p>5．“Tucked up snugly, and nestled (2) below</p>
<p>Our coverlid of wind-woven snow,</p>
<p>We peep and listen, all winter long,</p>
<p>For the first spring day and the bluebird’s song.</p>
<p>6．“When the swallows fly home to the old brown shed,</p>
<p>And the robins build on the bough overhead,</p>
<p>Then out from the mold (3) , from the darkness and cold,</p>
<p>Blossom and runner (4) and leaf unfold.</p>
<p>7．“Good children, then, if they come near,</p>
<p>And hearken a good long while, may hear</p>
<p>A wonderful tramping of little feet,—</p>
<p>So fast we grow in the summer heat.</p>
<p>8．“Our clocks are the flowers; and they count the hours</p>
<p>Till we can mellow (5) in suns and showers,</p>
<p>With warmth of the west wind and heat of the south,</p>
<p>A ripe red berry for a ripe red month.</p>
<p>9．“Apple blooms whiten, and peach blooms fall,</p>
<p>And roses are gay by the garden wall,</p>
<p>Ere the daisy’s dial (6) gives the sign</p>
<p>That we may invite little Pearl to dine.</p>
<p>10．“The days are longest, the month is June,</p>
<p>The year is nearing its golden noon,</p>
<p>The weather is fine, and our feast (7) is spread</p>
<p>With a green cloth and berries red.</p>
<p>11．“Just take us betwixt your finger and thumb,</p>
<p>And quick, oh, quick! for, see! there come</p>
<p>Tom on all fours, and Martin the man,</p>
<p>And Margaret, picking as fast as they can.</p>
<p>12．“Oh, dear! if you only knew how it shocks</p>
<p>Nice berries like us to be sold by the box,</p>
<p>And eaten by strangers, and paid for with pelf (8) ,</p>
<p>You would surely take pity, and eat us yourself!”</p>
<p>13．And this is the story the small lips told</p>
<p>To dear Pearl Honeydew, six years old,</p>
<p>When she laid her head on the strawberry bed</p>
<p>To hear what the red-cheeked berries said.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What did little Pearl ask of the strawberries? What did
they reply? Can you tell what name is given to this kind of story?</p>

<h2 id="lesson-25-harrys-riches">LESSON 25 HARRY’S RICHES</h2>
<p>哈利的财富</p>
<p>1．One day, our little Harry spent the morning with his young
playmate, Johnny Crane, who lived in a fine house, and on Sundays rode
to church in the grandest carriage to be seen in all the country
round.</p>
<p>2．When Harry returned home, he said, “Mother, Johnny has money in
both pockets!”</p>
<p>3．“Has he, dear?”</p>
<p>4．“Yes, ma’am; and he says he could get ever so much more if he
wanted it.”</p>
<p>5．“Well, now, that’s very pleasant for him,” I returned, cheerfully,
as a reply was plainly expected. “Very pleasant; don’t you think
so?”</p>
<p>6．“Yes, ma’am; only—”</p>
<p>7．“Only what, Harry?”</p>
<p>8．“Why, he has a big popgun, and a watch, and a hobbyhorse, and lots
of things.” And Harry looked up at my face with a disconsolate (1)
stare.</p>
<p>9．“Well, my boy, what of that?”</p>
<p>10．“Nothing, mother,” and the telltale tears sprang to his eyes,
“only I guess we are very poor, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>11．“No, indeed, Harry, we are very far from being poor. We are not
so rich as Mr. Crane’s family, if that is what you mean.”</p>
<p>12．“O mother!” insisted the little fellow, “I do think we are very
poor; anyhow, I am!”</p>
<p>13．“O Harry!” I exclaimed, reproachfully (2) .</p>
<p>14．“Yes, ma’am I am,” he sobbed; “I have scarcely anything—I mean
anything that’s worth money—except things to eat and wear, and I’d have
to have them anyway.”</p>
<p>15．“Have to have them?” I echoed, at the same time laying my sewing
upon the table, so that I might reason with him on that point; “do you
not know, my son—”</p>
<p>16．Just then Uncle Ben looked up from the paper he had been reading:
“Harry,” said he, “I want to find out something about eyes; so, if you
will let me have yours, I will give you a dollar apiece for them.”</p>
<p>17．“For my eyes!” exclaimed Harry, very much astonished.</p>
<p>18．“Yes,” resumed Uncle Ben, quietly, “for your eyes. I will give
you chloroform (3) , so it will not hurt you in the least, and you shall
have a beautiful glass pair for nothing, to wear in their place. Come, a
dollar apiece, cash down! What do you say? I will take them out as quick
as a wink.”</p>
<p>19．“Give you my eyes, uncle!” cried Harry, looking wild at the very
thought, “I think not.” And the startled (4) little fellow shook his
head defiantly (5) .</p>
<p>20．“Well, five, ten, twenty dollars, then.” Harry shook his head at
every offer.</p>
<p>21．“No, sir! I wouldn’t let you have them for a thousand dollars!
What could I do without my eyes? I couldn’t see mother, nor the baby,
nor the flowers, nor the horses, nor anything,” added Harry, growing
warmer and warmer.</p>
<p>22．“I will give you two thousand,” urged Uncle Ben, taking a roll of
bank notes out of his pocket. Harry, standing at a respectful distance,
shouted that he never would do any such thing.</p>
<p>23．“Very well,” continued the uncle, with a serious air, at the same
time writing something in his notebook, “I can’t afford (6) to give you
more than two thousand dollars, so I shall have to do without your eyes;
but,” he added, “I will tell you what I will do, I will give you twenty
dollars if you will let me put a few drops from this bottle in your
ears. It will not hurt, but it will make you deaf. I want to try some
experiments (7) with deafness, you see. Come quickly, now! Here are the
twenty dollars all ready for you.”</p>
<p>24．“Make me deaf!” shouted Harry, without even looking at the gold
pieces temptingly displayed upon the table. “I guess you will not do
that, either. Why, I couldn’t hear a single word if I were deaf, could
I?”</p>
<p>25．“Probably not,” replied Uncle Ben. So, of course, Harry refused
again. He would never give up his hearing, he said, “no, not for three
thousand dollars.”</p>
<p>26．Uncle Ben made another note in his book, and then came out with
large bids for “a right arm,” then “left arm,” “hands,” “feet,” “nose,”
finally ending with an offer of ten thousand dollars for “mother,” and
five thousand for “the baby.”</p>
<p>27．To all of these offers Harry shook his head, his eyes flashing,
and exclamations (8) of surprise and indignation bursting from his lips.
At last, Uncle Ben said he must give up his experiments, for Harry’s
prices were entirely too high.</p>
<p>28．“Ha! ha!” laughed the boy, exultingly (9) , and he folded his
dimpled arms and looked as if to say, “I’d like to see the man who could
pay them!”</p>
<p>29．“Why, Harry, look here!” exclaimed Uncle Ben, peeping into his
notebook, “here is a big addition sum, I tell you!” He added the
numbers, and they amounted to thirty-two thousand dollars.</p>
<p>30．“There, Harry,” said Uncle Ben, “don’t you think you are foolish
not to accept some of my offers?” “No, sir, I don’t,” answered Harry,
resolutely. “Then,” said Uncle Ben, “you talk of being poor, and by your
own showing you have treasures (10) for which you will not take
thirty-two thousand dollars. What do you say to that?”</p>
<p>31．Harry didn’t know exactly what to say. So he blushed for a
second, and just then tears came rolling down his cheeks, and he threw
his chubby arms around my neck. “Mother,” he whispered, “isn’t God good
to make everybody so rich?”</p>

<p>2．哈利回到家时，他说：“妈妈，约翰尼两个口袋里都装着钱！”</p>
<p>3．“是吗，我的宝贝儿？”</p>
<p>4．“是的，妈妈，他还说如果他想要，还能拿到更多的钱。”</p>
<p>5．“哦，那对他来说是挺好的。”我很高兴地说，因为他显然期待我的回应：“挺好的，对吧，你不觉得吗？”</p>
<p>6．“是的，妈妈，只是……”</p>
<p>7．“只是什么，哈利？”</p>
<p>8．“为什么他会有一个大的玩具枪、手表、摇动木马，还有好多好多东西。”哈利抬起头，委屈地凝视我的脸。</p>
<p>9．“嗯，我的孩子，有这些怎么了？”</p>
<p>10．“没事，妈妈，”他眼里流出的泪水无法掩饰，“只是我觉得咱们家很穷，是吗？”</p>
<p>11．“没有，事实上，哈利。我们离穷还远着呢。只是我们不如克莱恩家里有钱，如果这是你想表达的意思的话。”</p>
<p>12．“哦，妈妈，”小家伙继续坚持着，“我还是觉得我们非常穷，不管怎样，我很穷。”</p>
<p>13．“哦，哈利！”我用责备的口吻叫了一声。</p>
<p>14．“是的，妈妈，我很穷，”他抽泣着说，“我几乎什么都没有，几乎没有什么值钱的东西，除了吃的和穿的，这是我不能没有的东西。”</p>
<p>15．“不能没有的东西？”我重复了一遍，把手头的针线活放在桌上，这样好和他在这一点上接着讨论。“你不知道吗，我的儿子——”</p>
<p>16．本叔叔正在看报纸，这时他抬起头来，说：“哈利，我想要对眼睛做些研究，所以，如果你愿意把你的眼睛给我，每只眼睛我给你一美元。”</p>
<p>17．“要我的眼睛吗！”哈利大叫，非常震惊。</p>
<p>18．“是啊。”本叔叔很平静地又说了一遍：“要你的眼睛。我用氯仿给你麻醉，这样你一点儿都不疼，然后给你戴上一副漂亮的玻璃眼球，代替原来的眼睛。来，一只眼睛一美元，直接付现金。你觉得呢？我会在眨眼间把它们取下来。”</p>
<p>19．“给你我的眼睛吗，叔叔！”哈利叫道，觉得这个想法很疯狂，“我觉得不行。”这个受惊的小家伙反抗地摇了摇头。</p>
<p>20．“那五美元？十美元？二十美元？”每个报价哈利都摇头。</p>
<p>21．“不行，叔叔！给我一千美元我也不能给您。没有了眼睛我还能做什么呢？我再也看不到妈妈，看不到小宝宝，看不到花朵，看不到马儿，什么都看不到了！”哈利说着，越来越气愤。</p>
<p>22．“我给你两千美元。”本叔叔极力劝说，从口袋里拿出一叠钱。哈利站得远远的，大喊着说他绝对不会这么做的。</p>
<p>23．“很好。”本叔叔接着说，语气严肃起来，同时在笔记本上写着些什么。“两千美元以上我就付不起了，所以我只能放弃用你的眼睛做实验。不过，”他接着说道，“我会告诉你我要做什么。要是你能允许我向你耳朵里滴几滴这瓶里的液体，我给你二十美元。不会疼，但会让你的耳朵变聋。我正在做一些关于聋子的实验，你看。快过来。二十美元都给你准备好了。”</p>
<p>24．“把我变聋！”哈利叫着，看都不看桌上诱人的金币。“我觉得你也不会那么做的，为什么，如果我聋了，我就什么都听不到了，不是吗？”</p>
<p>25．“可能不行，”本叔叔说。所以，哈利当然又拒绝了。他说他绝对不会放弃自己的听力，“不行，三千美元也不行。”</p>
<p>26．本叔叔在本子上又记下什么，接着提议要“右胳膊”、“左胳膊”、“双手”、“双脚”、“鼻子”，开价都很高，最终想要一万美元换“妈妈”，五千美元换“宝宝”。</p>
<p>27．面对这些报价，哈利一直摇头。眼睛闪烁着，嘴巴里不停发出惊奇和愤怒的声音。最后，本叔叔说他必须放弃实验了，因为哈利的东西都太贵了。</p>
<p>28．“哈哈！”哈利胜利地笑了，胖胖的胳膊交叉在胸前，看起来好像说：“我倒要看看谁能付得起。”</p>
<p>29．“来啊，哈利，看这儿。”本叔叔看着他的笔记本大叫，“这是一个巨大的金额，我告诉你！”他把所有的数字加起来，总额有三万两千美元。</p>
<p>30．“看啊，哈利，”本叔叔说，“你不觉得不接受我的一些出价很愚蠢吗？”“才不呢，叔叔。”哈利坚定地回答。本叔叔说：“那你说你穷，但刚才你又不肯接受三万两千美元来换你的宝藏。你对此想说什么呢？”</p>
<p>31．哈利完全不知道说什么好。他脸红了一阵子，泪水也顺着脸颊流了下来。他用胖乎乎的胳膊紧紧搂着我的脖子，低声说：“妈妈，上帝让我们每个人都这么富有，难道不是很好么？”</p>

<p>在时间的秋千上</p>
<p>1．Father Time, your footsteps go</p>
<p>Lightly as the falling snow.</p>
<p>In your swing I’m sitting, see!</p>
<p>Push me softly; one, two; three,</p>
<p>Twelve times only. Like a sheet,</p>
<p>Spread the snow beneath my feet.</p>
<p>Singing merrily, let me swing</p>
<p>Out of winter into spring.</p>
<p>2．Swing me out, and swing me in!</p>
<p>Trees are bare, but birds begin</p>
<p>Twittering (1) to the peeping leaves,</p>
<p>On the bough beneath the eaves.</p>
<p>Wait,—one lilac bud I saw.</p>
<p>Icy hillsides feel the thaw.</p>
<p>April chased off March to-day;</p>
<p>Now I catch a glimpse (2) of May.</p>
<p>3．Oh, the smell of sprouting grass!</p>
<p>In a blur (3) the violets pass.</p>
<p>Whispering from the wildwood come</p>
<p>Mayflower’s breath and insect’s hum.</p>
<p>Roses carpeting the ground;</p>
<p>Thrushes, orioles, warbling sound:—</p>
<p>Swing me low, and swing me high,</p>
<p>To the warm clouds of July.</p>
<p>4．Slower now, for at my side</p>
<p>White pond lilies open wide.</p>
<p>Underneath the pine’s tall spire</p>
<p>Cardinal blossoms burn like fire.</p>
<p>They are gone; the golden-rod</p>
<p>Flashes from the dark green sod.</p>
<p>Crickets in the grass I hear;</p>
<p>Asters light the fading year.</p>
<p>5．Slower still! October weaves</p>
<p>Rainbows of the forest leaves.</p>
<p>Gentians fringed, like eyes of blue,</p>
<p>Glimmer out of sleety dew.</p>
<p>Meadow green I sadly miss:</p>
<p>Winds through withered sedges hiss.</p>
<p>Oh, ’t is snowing, swing me fast,</p>
<p>While December shivers past!</p>
<p>6．Frosty-bearded Father Time,</p>
<p>Stop your footfall on the rime (4) !</p>
<p>Hard you push, your hand is rough;</p>
<p>You have swung me long enough.</p>
<p>“Nay, no stopping,” say you? Well,</p>
<p>Some of your best stories tell,</p>
<p>While you swing me—gently, do!—</p>
<p>From the Old Year to the New.</p>

<p>轻盈如同雪花飘落。</p>
<p>我就坐在你的时间秋千之上。看哪！</p>
<p>轻轻推我；一、二、三，</p>
<p>只有十二下。像一张床单，</p>
<p>雪在我脚下铺展。</p>
<p>欢快地唱吧，让我随歌声摇摆</p>
<p>走过冬天迎来春天。</p>
<p>2．把我摇来摇去！</p>
<p>枝头光秃秃，但鸟儿已经开始</p>
<p>在屋檐下的枝头上，</p>
<p>冲着将要冒出的嫩芽歌唱，</p>
<p>等等——我看到了丁香花蕾。</p>
<p>冰冷的山坡上冰雪融化。</p>
<p>四月追赶着把三月赶跑；</p>
<p>现在我又看到了五月的来临。</p>

<p>朦胧中看到紫罗兰。</p>
<p>五月花的呼吸和昆虫的低鸣</p>
<p>在原始丛林中低声传递。</p>
<p>玫瑰花铺满了整个大地；</p>

<p>从深绿的草地上星星点点冒出。</p>
<p>我听到草丛中蟋蟀的叫声；</p>
<p>翠菊点亮了逝去的一年。</p>

<p>编织成彩虹般多彩。</p>
<p>龙胆根结穗，像蓝色的眼睛，</p>
<p>在雨雪夹杂的露水中。</p>
<p>我无比怀念那翠绿的草原：</p>
<p>风吹枯草发出沙沙的声音。</p>
<p>哦，下雪了。快些摇吧！</p>
<p>让十二月在战栗中快些度过吧！</p>
<p>6．白胡子的时间老人啊！</p>
<p>在这白霜之中停下你的脚步！</p>
<p>你推得太快，你的手是那么粗糙；</p>
<p>你已经推我摆动的时间够长了。</p>
<p>“不，不能停。”你这么说吗？哦，</p>
<p>那就给我讲一些美好的故事吧，</p>
<p>一边摇我一边讲，慢慢地——</p>
<p>从过去的一年讲到新的一年。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-27-harry-and-his-dog">LESSON 27 HARRY AND HIS DOG</h2>
<p>哈利和他的狗</p>
<p>1．“Beg, Frisk, beg,” said little Harry, as he sat on an inverted (1)
basket, at his grandmother’s door, eating, with great satisfaction, a
porringer (2) of bread and milk. His little sister Annie, who had
already dispatched her breakfast, sat on the ground opposite to him, now
twisting her flowers into garlands, and now throwing them away.</p>
<p>2．“Beg, Frisk, beg!” repeated Harry, holding a bit of bread just out
of the dog’s reach; and the obedient Frisk squatted himself on his hind
legs, and held up his fore paws, waiting for master Harry to give him
the tempting morsel.</p>
<p>3．The little boy and the little dog were great friends. Frisk loved
him dearly, much better than he did anyone else; perhaps, because he
recollected (3) that Harry was his earliest and firmest friend during a
time of great trouble.</p>
<p>4．Poor Frisk had come as a stray dog to Milton, the place where
Harry lived. If he could have told his own story, it would probably have
been a very pitiful one, of kicks and cuffs, of hunger and foul
weather.</p>
<p>5．Certain it is, he made his appearance at the very door where Harry
was now sitting, in miserable plight (4) , wet, dirty, and half starved;
and that there he met Harry, who took a fancy to him, and Harry’s
grandmother, who drove him off with a broom.</p>
<p>6．Harry, at length, obtained permission for the little dog to remain
as a sort of outdoor pensioner (5) , and fed him with stray bones and
cold potatoes, and such things as he could get for him. He also provided
him with a little basket to sleep in, the very same which, turned up,
afterward served Harry for a seat.</p>
<p>7．After a while, having proved his good qualities by barking away a
set of pilferers (6) , who were making an attack on the great pear tree,
he was admitted into the house, and became one of its most vigilant (7)
and valued inmates (8) . He could fetch or carry either by land or
water; would pick up a thimble or a ball of cotton, if little Annie
should happen to drop them; or take Harry’s dinner to school for him
with perfect honesty.</p>
<p>8．“Beg, Frisk, beg!” said Harry, and gave him, after long waiting,
the expected morsel. Frisk was satisfied, but Harry was not. The little
boy, though a good-humored fellow in the main, had turns of naughtiness,
which were apt to last him all day, and this promised to prove one of
his worst. It was a holiday (9) , and in the afternoon his cousins, Jane
and William, were to come and see him and Annie; and the pears were to
be gathered, and the children were to have a treat.</p>
<p>9．Harry, in his impatience, thought the morning would never be over.
He played such pranks—buffeting (10) Frisk, cutting the curls off of
Annie’s doll, and finally breaking his grandmother’s spectacles—that
before his visitors arrived, indeed, almost immediately after dinner, he
contrived to be sent to bed in disgrace.</p>
<p>10．Poor Harry! there he lay, rolling and kicking, while Jane, and
William, and Annie were busy about the fine, mellow Windsor pears.
William was up in the tree, gathering and shaking; Annie and Jane
catching them in their aprons, and picking them up from the ground; now
piling them in baskets, and now eating the nicest and ripest; while
Frisk was barking gayly among them, as if he were catching Windsor
pears, too!</p>
<p>11．Poor Harry! He could hear all this glee and merriment through the
open window as he lay in bed. The storm of passion having subsided (11)
, there he lay weeping and disconsolate, a grievous sob bursting forth
every now and then, as he heard the loud peals of childish laughter, and
as he thought how he should have laughed, and how happy he should have
been, had he not forfeited (12) all this pleasure by his own bad
conduct.</p>
<p>12．He wondered if Annie would not be so good-natured as to bring him
a pear. All on a sudden, he heard a little foot on the stair, pitapat,
and he thought she was coming. Pitapat came the foot, nearer and nearer,
and at last a small head peeped, half afraid, through the half-open
door.</p>
<p>13．But it was not Annie’s head; it was Frisk’s—poor Frisk, whom
Harry had been teasing and tormenting all the morning, and who came into
the room wagging his tail, with a great pear in his mouth; and, jumping
upon the bed, he laid it in the little boy’s hand.</p>
<p>14．Is not Frisk a fine, grateful fellow? and does he not deserve a
share of Harry’s breakfast, whether he begs for it or not? And little
Harry will remember from the events of this day that kindness, even
though shown to a dog, will always be rewarded; and that ill nature and
bad temper are connected (13) with nothing but pain and disgrace.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-267">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．“作揖，弗里斯克，作揖。”小哈利对狗说。他坐在奶奶家门口一个倒扣着的篮子上，心满意足地吃着一碟面包和喝着一杯牛奶。他妹妹安妮早就吃完早饭，坐在哈利对面，把花朵编成了花环，又把它们扔到一边。</p>
<p>2．“作揖，弗里斯克，作揖。”哈利不断地说，手里的面包举着，狗够不到。温顺的弗里斯克后腿支撑坐在地上，抬起前爪，等着主人哈利给它一口诱人的美食。</p>
<p>3．小男孩和小狗是好朋友。弗里斯克非常爱它的主人，胜于爱其他所有人。可能是由于它一直觉得哈利是它困难时期最早认识且最亲近的朋友。</p>
<p>4．可怜的弗里斯克当时来米尔顿（也就是哈利家）时，是只流浪狗。如果它会说话，它讲出来自己的故事，那是一段非常悲惨、拳打脚踢、挨饿受冻的经历。</p>
<p>5．可以肯定的是，它出现在哈利家的门前，就在哈利现在坐着的地方，可怜兮兮的样子，又湿又脏，饥肠辘辘。它就在这儿遇见了哈利，哈利也喜欢上了它，而哈利的奶奶却想用扫把把它赶走。</p>
<p>6．哈利最后还是说服奶奶让这只可怜的小狗在家门外得到一些食物，喂它散骨头、凉土豆和其他类似他能弄到的食物。他还找来一个篮子让它睡在里面，就是现在哈利倒扣着当座椅的那个。</p>
<p>7．过了一段时间，小狗用叫声吓走了一群想要偷大梨树上的梨的家伙，这也证明了它的看家本领。从此，它可以进到房子里面了，并且成了家里最警醒、最宝贵的一员。它可以从地上或水里取东西；如果安妮不小心掉了顶针或棉线球，它也会捡起来；它还能听话地去学校给哈利送饭。</p>
<p>8．“作揖，弗里斯克，作揖。”哈利说着。等了好久之后，终于把这小小的诱惑给它了。弗里斯克很满足，但哈利并没有。这个孩子，虽然大体上脾气不错，但也有淘气的一面，而且有时会持续一整天，这肯定是他最坏的时候。假期的一个午后，他的表妹珍妮和表弟威廉要来找他和安妮。树上的梨成熟了，孩子们能大吃一顿。</p>
<p>9．哈利不耐烦地想，这个早晨过得太慢了。他开始胡闹，使劲儿拍打弗里斯克，剪掉了安妮的布娃娃的卷发，甚至还弄坏了奶奶的花镜。在他的客人来之前，确切说是在晚饭后，他被罚待在床上。</p>
<p>10．可怜的哈利！躺在那儿，滚来滚去，踢这儿踢那儿，珍妮、威廉和安妮在外面忙着摘熟透了的温莎梨。威廉爬到树上，一边摘一边摇，安妮和珍妮忙着用围裙接住梨子，还不时地捡起掉在地上的。然后把梨装在篮子里，挑最熟最好的吃。弗里斯克也在那儿开心地汪汪叫，就像它也在摘温莎梨一样。</p>
<p>11．可怜的哈利！他能从开着的窗户听见外面的欢笑声，而他只能躺在床上。他的热闹劲儿也过了，躺在那儿眼泪汪汪地伤心起来，听着外面孩子们的笑声，一想到要不是自己调皮捣乱，本该一起高高兴兴地笑着，他就时不时撕心裂肺地大哭几声。</p>
<p>12．他在想安妮会不会好心地给他拿一个梨来。突然间，他听见楼梯上轻轻的脚步声，他觉得是安妮来了。砰砰的脚步声，越来越近，最后从半开的门缝里怯怯地探出小小的脑袋。</p>
<p>13．但这不是安妮的脑袋，是弗里斯克的——可怜的弗里斯克，刚刚被哈利又是玩弄又是折磨了整整一个早晨，现在它进屋冲着哈利摇着尾巴，嘴里叼着一个大梨。它跳上床，把梨放在哈利手里。</p>
<p>14．弗里斯克难道不是好心又感恩的伙伴吗？不管它作揖没作揖，难道它不该得到哈利的一份早餐吗？从今天发生的这件事中，小哈利会永远记得：即使是对小狗的善良，也总是会得到回报；而恶毒和坏脾气，除了痛苦和懊恼，什么也不会得到。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-29-the-eagle">LESSON 29 THE EAGLE</h2>
<p>鹰</p>
<p>1．The eagle seems to enjoy a kind of supremacy (1) over the rest of
the inhabitants of the air. Such is the loftiness of his flight, that he
often soars (2) in the sky beyond the reach of the naked eye, and such
is his strength that he has been known to carry away children in his
talons. But many of the noble qualities imputed (3) to him are rather
fanciful than true.</p>
<p>2．He has been described as showing a lofty (4) independence, which
makes him disdain (5) to feed on anything that is not slain by his own
strength. But Alexander Wilson, the great naturalist, says that he has
seen an eagle feasting on the carcass (6) of a horse. The eagle lives to
a great age. One at Vienna is stated to have died after a confinement of
one hundred and four years.</p>
<p>3．There are several species (7) of the eagle. The golden eagle,
which is one of the largest, is nearly four feet from the point of the
beak to the end of the tail. He is found in most parts of Europe, and is
also met with in America. High rocks and ruined and lonely towers are
the places which he chooses for his abode. His nest is composed of
sticks and rushes. The tail feathers are highly valued as ornaments by
the American Indians.</p>
<p>4．The most interesting (8) species is the bald eagle, as this is an
American bird, and the adopted (9) emblem (10) of our country. He lives
chiefly upon fish, and is found in the neighborhood of the sea, and
along the shores and cliffs of our large lakes and rivers.</p>
<p>5．According to the description given by Wilson, he depends, in
procuring his food, chiefly upon the labors of others. He watches the
fishhawk as he dives into the sea for his prey, and darting down upon
him as he rises, forces him to relinquish (11) his victim, and then
seizes it before it again reaches the water.</p>
<p>6．One of the most notable (12) species is the harpy eagle. This is
said to be bold and strong, and to attack beasts, and even man himself.
He is fierce, quarrelsome, and sullen (13) , living alone in the deepest
forests.He is found chiefly in South America.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-269">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．鹰似乎比空中的其他动物享有更至高无上的地位。它的飞行高度极高，有时直冲而上，飞到肉眼都看不到的地方；它的力量巨大，据说能用爪子抓起小孩。不过，它们被赋予的很多卓越品质都是想象的，并不真实。</p>
<p>2．在人们的描述中，它们有一种高傲的独立性，从不食用任何不是由它们自己杀死的猎物。但是，一位伟大的博物学家亚历山大·威尔逊说，他曾经看见一只老鹰大吃一匹马的残骸。老鹰可以活很大年纪。据说有一只生活在维也纳的鹰，在饲养了104年后去世。</p>
<p>3．老鹰也分几个种类。金雕是最大的一种鹰，从鹰嘴尖到尾部大约有4英尺长。金雕生活在欧洲的很多地区，美国也有一些。高高的山石和废旧遗弃的高塔是它们常常选择的栖身之所。它们的巢是用棍子和干草做成。美国印第安人把金雕尾部的羽毛尊为一种装饰物。</p>
<p>4．最有意思的一类是秃鹰，因为这是一种美国鸟，还被当作了美国的象征。它主要以鱼类为食，经常出现在海边，以及大河、大湖的岸边和岩石上。</p>
<p>5．根据威尔逊给出的描述，秃鹰获得食物主要依靠其他鸟类的劳动。鱼鹰扎进海里捕食猎物时，秃鹰就在一边看着。当鱼鹰一出水面，秃鹰猛冲下去，迫使鱼鹰放开猎物，并在猎物落进水里之前把它抓住。</p>
<p>6．最著名的一类是美洲角雕。据说它非常大胆，非常强壮，会袭击野兽，甚至人类。角雕非常凶猛好斗，总是阴郁沉默，独自居住在森林深处，主要栖息在南美地区。</p>

<p>老鹰树</p>
<p>1．In a distant field, stood a large tulip tree, apparently of a
century’s (1) growth, and one of the most gigantic (2) . It looked like
the father of the surrounding forest. A single tree of huge dimensions
(3) , standing all alone, is a sublime (4) object.</p>
<p>2．On the top of this tree, an old eagle, commonly called the
“Fishing Eagle,” had built her nest every year, for many years, and,
undisturbed, had raised her young. A remarkable place to choose, as she
procured her food from the ocean, and this tree stood full ten miles
from the seashore. It had long been known as the “Old Eagle Tree.”</p>
<p>3．On a warm, sunny day, the workmen were hoeing corn in an adjoining
field. At a certain hour of the day, the old eagle was known to set off
for the seaside, to gather food for her young. As she this day returned
with a large fish in her claws, the workmen surrounded the tree, and, by
yelling and hooting, and throwing stones, so scared the poor bird that
she dropped her fish, and they carried it off in triumph.</p>
<p>4．The men soon dispersed (5) , but Joseph sat down under a hush
nearby, to watch, and to bestow unavailing (6) pity. The bird soon
returned to her nest, without food. The eaglets (7) at once set up a cry
for food, so shrill, so clear, and so clamorous (8) that the boy was
greatly moved.</p>
<p>5．The parent bird seemed to try to soothe them; but their appetites
were too keen, and it was all in vain. She then perched herself on a
limb near them, and looked down into the nest in a manner that seemed to
say, “I know not what to do next.”</p>
<p>6．Her indecision (9) was but momentary (10) ; again she poised
herself, uttered one or two sharp notes, as if telling them to a “lie
still,” balanced her body, spread her wings, and was away again for the
sea.</p>
<p>7．Joseph was determined to see the result. His eye followed her till
she grew small, smaller, a mere speck in the sky, and then disappeared.
What boy has not thus watched the flight of the bird of his country!</p>
<p>8．She was gone nearly two hours, about double her usual time for a
voyage, when she again returned, on a slow, weary wing, flying
uncommonly low, in order to have a heavier atmosphere to sustain her,
with another fish in her talons.</p>
<p>9．On nearing the field, she made a circuit (11) round it, to see if
her enemies were again there. Finding the coast clear, she once more
reached the tree, drooping, faint, and weary, and evidently nearly
exhausted (12) . Again the eaglets set up their cry, which was soon
hushed by the distribution of a dinner, such as, save the cooking, a
king might admire.</p>
<p>10．“Glorious bird!” cried the boy, “what a spirit!” Other birds can
fly more swiftly, others can sing more sweetly, others scream more
loudly; but what other bird, when persecuted and robbed, when weary,
when discouraged, when so far from the sea, would do this?</p>
<p>11．“Glorious bird! I will learn a lesson from thee to-day. I will
never forget, hereafter, that when the spirit is determined it can do
almost anything. Others would have drooped, and hung the head, and
mourned over the cruelty of man, and sighed over the wants of the
nestlings (13) ; but thou, by at once recovering the loss, hast
forgotten all.”</p>
<p>12．“I will learn of thee, noble bird! I will remember this. I will
set my mark high. I will try to do something, and to be something in the
world; I will never yield to discouragements.”</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Relate the story of the “Old Eagle Tree.” What lesson was
taught the boy who watched the eagle’s actions?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-270">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．在遥远的荒野，屹立着一棵郁金香树，看起来已经生长了一百年，是那里最大的树之一。它看起来就像是附近大树的父亲。一棵巨大的树孤零零生长在那里，是非常壮观的景象。</p>
<p>2．在这棵树顶端，一只老鹰（被人们叫作“鱼雕”）每年都在那儿建造自己的巢穴，一年复一年，从不间断，也在这儿抚养了它的后代。由于要到大海里捕获猎物，因此这里是一个非常好的地点，因为这棵树距离海岸有整整十英里。这棵树也一直被叫作“老鹰树”。</p>
<p>3．温暖晴朗的一天，农民在附近玉米地里锄草。每天的一个特定时刻，老鹰会飞向海边，为它的孩子们猎取食物。这天老鹰回来的时候，它的爪子抓着一条大鱼，农民们围在树边，又喊又叫，还向上扔石头，可怜的鸟儿被吓坏了，鱼也掉了下来，农民们得意扬扬地把鱼拿走了。</p>
<p>4．那些人很快散去了，不过约瑟夫在附近的一处灌木旁坐下来，想看看会怎么样，并徒劳地同情这只鹰。鹰很快回到自己的巢里，没有带回任何食物。小鹰们吵嚷起来，想要吃的，它们的叫声那么尖锐、那么清晰、那么聒噪，这男孩觉得很受触动。</p>
<p>5．老鹰仿佛试图安慰它们，但它们食欲太好了，怎么安慰都没用。老鹰飞到旁边的树枝上，向下看着巢里的孩子们，那姿态仿佛在说：“我不知道接下来该做什么。”</p>
<p>6．它的不知所措只持续了很短的时间，很快，它做好准备，发出高亢的叫声，好像在告诉小鹰们“好好等着”，身体找好平衡，展开双翼，又向大海飞去。</p>
<p>7．约瑟夫决定要看看结果。他目送母鹰飞走，看它的身影越来越小，越来越小，直到变成天空中的一个小点，然后消失了。哪个男孩没有像这样看过自己国家的国鸟如此翱翔呢！</p>
<p>8．老鹰飞走了将近有两个小时，当它回来的时候，几乎花费了它平时出海觅食时间的两倍。只见它用爪子抓着一条鱼，翅膀挥动得又慢又疲惫，飞得也超乎寻常地低，这样更低层的大气还能支撑着她。</p>
<p>9．快到终点时，它绕着盘旋了一圈，看看它的敌人是不是还在这里。发现附近很安全后，它再一次落到树上，低垂着头，又虚弱又疲倦，很显然它几乎筋疲力尽了。小鹰们再次叫了起来，不过随着晚餐的分配，很快安静下来了，似乎这顿晚餐的美味，连国王都会喜欢。</p>
<p>10．“光荣的鸟啊！”约瑟夫叫道，“多么高贵的精神！”其他的鸟可以飞得更快，唱得更甜美，叫声更大，但遭受惊吓和抢劫之后，疲惫的时候，灰心的时候，距离海洋这么远的时候，可能这么做吗？</p>
<p>11．“光荣的鸟啊！今天我从你这里学到了一课。从今之后，我永远不会忘记，只要有决心，一切都可为。其他鸟可能会垂头丧气，为人类的残忍而悲伤，为幼鸟们的需求而叹气，只有你，立刻从挫败中恢复过来，忘记一切灾难。”</p>
<p>12．“我会向你学习，高贵的鸟！我会记住这一点，把自己的目标定得高些。我会努力做出成绩，在世界上有所成就。我绝对不会向挫折屈服。”</p>

ALTER CASES</h2>
<p>情况不同，反应不同</p>
<p>1．Derby. Good morning, neighbor Scrapewell. I have half a dozen
miles to ride to-day, and shall be extremely (1) obliged if you will
lendme your gray mare.</p>
<p>2．Scrapewell. It would give me great pleasure to oblige you, friend
Derby; but I am under the necessity of going to the mill this very
morning, with a bag of corn. My wife wants the meal to-day, and you know
what a time there’ll be if I disappoint her.</p>
<p>3．D. Then she must want it still, for I can assure you the mill does
not go to-day. I heard the miller tell Will Davis that the water was too
low.</p>
<p>4．S. You don’t say so! That is bad, indeed; for in that case I shall
be obliged to gallop off to town for the meal. My wife would comb my
head for me if I should neglect it.</p>
<p>5．D. I can save you this journey, for I have plenty of meal at home,
and will lend your wife as much as she wants.</p>
<p>6．S. Ah! neighbor Derby, I am sure your meal would never suit my
wife. You can’t conceive how whimsical (2) she is.</p>
<p>7．D. If she were ten times more whimsical than she is, I am certain
she would like it; for you sold it to me yourself, and you assured me it
was the best you ever had.</p>
<p>8．S. Yes, yes! that’s true, indeed; I always have the best of
everything. You know, neighbor Derby, that no one is more ready to
oblige a friend than I am; but I must tell you the mare this morning
refused to eat hay; and, truly, I am afraid she will not carry you.</p>
<p>9．D. Oh, never fear! I will feed her well with oats on the road.</p>
<p>10．S. Oats! neighbor; oats are very dear.</p>
<p>11．D. Never mind that. When I have a good job in view, I never stand
for trifles.</p>
<p>12．S. But it is very slippery; and I am really afraid she will fall
and break your neck.</p>
<p>13．D. Give yourself no uneasiness about that. The mare is certainly
sure-footed; and, besides, you were just now talking of galloping her to
town.</p>
<p>14．S. Well, then, to tell you the plain truth, though I wish to
oblige you with all my heart, my saddle is torn quite in pieces, and I
have just sent my bridle to be mended.</p>
<p>15．D. Luckily, I have both a bridle and a saddle hanging up at
home.</p>
<p>16．S. Ah! that may be; but I am sure your saddle will never fit my
mare. She’s very notional.</p>
<p>17．D. Why, then I’ll borrow neighbor Clodpole’s.</p>
<p>18．S. Clodpole’s! his will no more fit than yours.</p>
<p>19．D. At the worst, then, I will go to my good friend, Squire Jones.
He has half a score of them; and I am sure he will lend me one that will
fit her.</p>
<p>20．S. You know, friend Derby, that no one is more willing to oblige
his neighbors than I am. I do assure you the beast should beat your
service, with all my heart; but she has not been curried (3) , I
believe, for three weeks past. Her foretop (4) and mane want combing and
cutting very much. If anyone should see her in her present plight, it
would ruin the sale of her.</p>
<p>21．D. Oh, a horse is soon curried, and my son Sam shall attend to it
at once.</p>
<p>22．S. Yes, very likely; but I this moment recollect the creature has
no shoes on.</p>
<p>23．D. Well, is there not a blacksmith hard by?</p>
<p>24．S. What, that tinker, Dobson? I would not trust such a bungler
(5) to shoe a goat. No, no; none but uncle Tom Thumper shall shoe my
mare.</p>
<p>25．D. As good luck will have it, then, I shall pass right by his
door.</p>
<p>26．S. [Calling to his son. ] Tim, Tim! here’s neighbor Derby, who
wants the loan of the gray mare, to ride to town to-day. You know the
skin was rubbed off her back, last week, a hand’s breadth or more.
[Gives Tim a wink. ] However, I believe she is well enough by this time.
You know, Tim, how ready I am to oblige my neighbors; indeed, we ought
to do all the good we can in this world. We must certainly let neighbor
Derby have her if she will possibly answer his purpose. Yes, yes; I see
plainly by Tim’s countenance, neighbor Derby, that he’s disposed (6) to
oblige you. I would not have refused you the mare for the worth of her.
If I had, I should have expected you to refuse me in turn. None of my
neighbors can accuse me of being backward (7) in doing them a kindness
whenever it is possible. Come, Tim, what do you say?</p>
<p>27．Tim. What do I say, father? Why, sir, I say that I am no less
ready than you are to do a neighborly kindness. But the mare is by no
means capable (8) of performing (9) the journey. About a hand’s breadth,
did you say? Why, sir, the skin is torn from the poor creature’s back
the bigness of your broad-brimmed hat! And, besides, I have promised
her, so soon as she is able to travel, to Ned Saunders, to carry a load
of apples to market.</p>
<p>28．S. Do you hear that, neighbor? I am very sorry matters are thus.
I would not have disobliged you for the price of two such mares. Believe
me, neighbor Derby, I am really sorry, for your sake, that matters turn
out thus.</p>
<p>29．D. And I as much for yours, neighbor Scrapewell; for to tell you
the truth I received a letter this morning from Mr. Griffin, who tells
me if I will be in town to-day he will give me the refusal (10) of all
that lot of timber, which he is about cutting down, on the side of the
hill; and I had intended you should have shared half of it, which would
have been not less than fifty dollars in your pocket. But, as your—</p>
<p>30．S. Fifty dollars, did you say?</p>
<p>31．D. Ay, truly, did I; but as your mare is out of order, I’ll go
and see if I can get old Roan, the blacksmith’s horse.</p>
<p>32．S. Old Roan! My mare is at your service, neighbor, Here, Tim,
tell Ned Saunders he can’t have the mare: neighbor Derby wants her; and
I won’t refuse so good a friend anything he asks for.</p>
<p>33．D. But what are you to do for meal?</p>
<p>34．S. My wife can do without it for a week if you want the mare so
long.</p>
<p>35．D. But, then, your saddle is all in pieces.</p>
<p>36．S. I meant the old one. I have bought a new one since, and you
shall have the first use of it.</p>
<p>37．D. And shall I call at Thumper’s and get the mare shod?</p>
<p>38．S. No, no; I had forgotten to tell you that I let neighbor Dobson
shoe her, last week, by way of trial; and, to do him justice, he shoes
extremely well.</p>
<p>39．D. But, if the poor creature has lost so much skin from off her
back—</p>
<p>40．S. Poh, poh! That is just one of Tim’s large stories. I do assure
you it was not, at first, bigger than my thumb nail, and I am certain it
has not grown any since.</p>
<p>41．D. At least, however, let her have something she will eat, since
she refuses hay.</p>
<p>42．S. She did, indeed, refuse hay this morning; but the only reason
was that she was crammed (11) full of oats. You have nothing to fear,
neighbor; the mare is in perfect trim; and she will skim you over the
ground like a bird. I wish you a good journey and a profitable job.</p>

<p>1．德比（以下简称“德”）：
早上好，斯科拉普威尔，我的邻居。我今天要赶十几英里路，如果能把你的灰马借给我，我将感激不尽。</p>
<p>2．斯科拉普威尔（以下简称“斯”）：
我的朋友德比，能够帮助你是我莫大的荣幸，不过我今天早上需要到磨坊一趟，还得带着一袋玉米。我妻子今天想吃这样一顿饭，如果让她失望了，你知道我不会有好日子的。</p>
<p>3．德：
那么她肯定更想吃了，因为可以确定地告诉你，磨坊今天不开门。我听到磨坊主和威尔·戴维斯说水位太低了。</p>
<p>4．斯：
不可能吧！那可太糟糕了，真是的，这样的话我得快马加鞭去城里磨玉米。如果忽略了这件事，我妻子肯定得修理我。</p>
<p>5．德：
我能让您省了这趟路。我家里有足够的粗粮，你妻子想要多少我都能借给你。</p>
<p>6．斯：
啊，我的邻居德比啊，我敢肯定你的粗粮不符合我妻子的口味，你都想象不出她有多挑剔。</p>
<p>7．德：
即使她比现在再挑剔十倍，我也敢保证她会喜欢的，因为当时是你卖给我的，你还向我保证说这是你们最好的。</p>
<p>8．斯：
是的，是的，一点儿没错，确实是。我的一切总是最好的。你看，德比，没人比我更愿意帮助别人了，不过我必须告诉你，今天早上灰马不吃草料，我恐怕它载不动你，真的。</p>
<p>9．德： 哦，别担心！我在路上会喂它燕麦的。</p>
<p>10．斯： 燕麦！我的邻居啊，燕麦很贵的。</p>
<p>11．德： 别担心，当有份好工作在望时，我不会计较细枝末节的。</p>
<p>12．斯： 但是，路很滑，我很担心它摔倒后折断你的脖子。</p>
<p>13．德：
别为这些事烦心。灰马绝对步履稳健，再说了，刚才您还在说要快马加鞭去镇上呢。</p>
<p>14．斯：
那么，跟你说老实话吧，尽管我真的特别想帮助你，可我的马鞍已成了碎片，我也刚把缰绳送去修理。</p>
<p>15．德： 很幸运，我家里既有马鞍，也有缰绳。</p>
<p>16．斯：
啊，这样啊。不过你家的马鞍肯定和我家灰马不合适，它很有想法的。</p>
<p>17．德： 那要不我去借邻居克劳德普家的马鞍。</p>
<p>18．斯： 克劳德普家的啊，肯定比你的还不合适。</p>
<p>19．德：
实在不行的话，我去借我的好朋友斯夸尔•琼斯的。他家有好几套马鞍，我肯定他会把适合灰马的一套借给我。</p>
<p>20．斯：
你看，我的朋友德比啊，没有人比我更乐意帮助邻居了。我向你保证这匹马应该为你服务，不过它已经有三个星期没有梳刷了。它的额发和鬃毛非常需要梳理和修剪。如果有人看见它现在这么糟糕，会大大降低它的身价的。</p>
<p>21．德： 给马梳刷很快就能完成，我的儿子山姆就能立刻把这事做好。</p>
<p>22．斯： 是的，很可能。不过我现在刚想起来，这家伙还没有马掌呢。</p>
<p>23．德： 那附近不是有家铁匠铺吗？</p>
<p>24．斯：
谁啊，那个补锅的，多布森吗？我连给山羊钉脚掌都不敢交给他这样一个没经验的家伙。不行，不行，只有大铁匠汤姆·萨姆皮尔可以为我的马钉马掌。</p>
<p>25．德： 那可真是好运气啊，我恰好就会从他门前经过。</p>
<p>26．斯：（叫他的儿子）
蒂姆，蒂姆，咱们的邻居德比来了，他想借一下咱家的灰马，到镇上一趟。你是知道的，上周灰马背上擦破了皮，一个手掌那么宽，估计还宽点儿（冲蒂姆眨了眨眼）
。不过，我觉得它现在已经好了。你知道的，蒂姆，我是多么希望能够帮助我们的邻居，真的是，我们应该做这个世界上一切力所能及的善事。只要灰马能满足他的需求，我们当然会把它借给德比。没错，没错，从蒂姆的表情就能看出来，他非常愿意帮助你。我也不会因为灰马的价值而拒绝你。如果我拒绝了，那我就是在期待着将来你反过来拒绝帮助我。没有任何一个邻居会说我不愿意尽己所能帮助他们的。怎么样，蒂姆，你说呢？</p>
<p>27．蒂姆：
我怎么说呢，父亲。您看，我和您一样想要帮助我们的邻居。但是，灰马实在是不能胜任这趟行程。一个手掌那么宽，刚才您是这么说的吗？您知道吗，从灰马背上扯下来的皮，有您的宽边帽子那么大。另外，我还向奈德·桑德斯保证了，只要它能走了，就可以借他驮一些水果到市场上。</p>
<p>28．斯：
我的邻居，你听到了吧？我真的非常抱歉事情是这样的。即使花费两匹马的价钱我也愿意帮助您。相信我，德比，我真的非常抱歉，事情竟然是这样的。</p>
<p>29．德：
跟你这么说吧，斯科拉普威尔，我的邻居。实话告诉你，今天早上我收到格林芬先生的来信，他会将山那边他要砍伐的所有木材的优先取舍权给我，我本来打算给您一半，也就是能有不少于五十美元进到您的口袋里，不过，既然您的……</p>
<p>30．斯： 你说什么？五十美元？</p>
<p>31．德：
啊，是的，我是这么说的。但是，因为你的灰马不能用了，我去看看能不能借铁匠家的老杂毛马。</p>
<p>32．斯：
杂毛马！我的灰马随时为您效劳，我的邻居。蒂姆，告诉奈德·桑德斯他不能用我们的灰马了，邻居德比需要用。我是不会拒绝这样的好朋友的任何请求的。</p>
<p>33．德： 那你的粗粮怎么办呢？</p>
<p>34．斯：
如果你想要用一周时间的话，我的妻子可以这段时间都不用粗粮。</p>
<p>35．德： 但是，你的马鞍破成了碎片。</p>
<p>36．斯： 我是说那个旧的。我已经买了个新的，你应该第一个用。</p>
<p>37．德： 我路上得去大铁匠那儿钉马掌吧？</p>
<p>38．斯：
不用，不用，我忘记告诉你我上周让邻居多布森试着钉了马掌，公平地说，他钉得很不错。</p>
<p>39．德： 但是，这可怜的家伙，它的马背上掉了那么大一块皮。</p>
<p>40．斯：
没事，没事，那是蒂姆编的故事。我向你保证没那么严重，起初不过是像我的指甲盖那么大，我确定没再变大。</p>
<p>41．德： 那至少让它吃点儿它能吃的东西，因为它不吃干草。</p>
<p>42．斯：
它今天早上确实不吃干草，那是因为它吃燕麦吃饱了。我的邻居，你什么都不用担心，灰马也梳刷得很好，它会像鸟儿一样载着你在路上飞驰。祝福你一路顺风，工作多多盈利。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-33-the-noblest-revenge">LESSON 33 THE NOBLEST
REVENGE</h2>
<p>高尚的报复</p>
<p>1．“I will have revenge (1) on him, that I will, and make him
heartily repent (2) it,” said Philip to himself, with a countenance (3)
quite red with anger. His mind was so engaged that he did not see
Stephen, who happened at that instant to meet him.</p>
<p>2．“Who is that,” said Stephen, “on whom you intend to be revenged?”
Philip, as if awakened from a dream, stopped short, and looking at his
friend, soon resumed (4) a smile that was natural to his countenance.
“Ah,” said he, “you remember my bamboo, a very pretty cane which was
given me by my father, do you not? Look! there it is in pieces. It was
farmer Robinson’s son who reduced it to this worthless state.”</p>
<p>3．Stephen very coolly asked him what had induced (5) young Robinson
to break it. “I was walking peaceably along,” replied he, “and was
playing with my cane by twisting it round my body. By accident, one of
the ends slipped out of my hand, when I was opposite the gate, just by
the wooden bridge, where the ill-natured fellow had put down a pitcher
of water, which he was taking home from the well.”</p>
<p>4．“It so happened that my cane, in springing back, upset the
pitcher, but did not break it. He came up close to me, and began to call
me names, when I assured (6) him that what I had done had happened by
accident, and that I was sorry for it. Without regarding (7) what I
said, he instantly seized my cane, and twisted it, as you see; but I
will make him repent of it.”</p>
<p>5．“To be sure,” said Stephen, “he is a very wicked boy, and is
already very properly punished for being such, since nobody likes him or
will have anything to do with him. He can scarcely find a companion to
play with him; and is often at a loss for amusement, as he deserves to
be. This, properly considered (8) , I think will appear sufficient
revenge for you.”</p>
<p>6．“All this is true,” replied Philip, “but he has broken my cane. It
was a present from my father, and a very pretty cane it was. I offered
to fill his pitcher for him again, as I knocked it down by accident. I
will be revenged.”</p>
<p>7．“Now, Philip;” said Stephen, “I think you will act better in not
minding him, as your contempt (9) will be the best punishment you can
inflict (10) upon him. Be assured, he will always be able to do more
mischief to you than you choose to do to him. And, now I think of it, I
will tell you what happened to him not long since.</p>
<p>8．“Very unluckily for him, he chanced to see a bee hovering (11)
about a flower which he caught, and was going to pull off its wings out
of sport, when the animal stung him, and flew away in safety to the
hive. The pain put him into a furious passion, and, like you, he vowed
revenge. He accordingly procured a stick, and thrust it into the
beehive.</p>
<p>9．“In an instant the whole swarm flew out, and alighting upon him
stung him in a hundred different places. He uttered the most piercing
cries, and rolled upon the ground in the excess of his agony (12) . His
father immediately ran to him, but could not put the bees to flight
until they had stung him so severely that he was confined several days
to his bed.</p>
<p>10．“Thus, you see, he was not very successful in his pursuit of
revenge. I would advise you, therefore, to pass over his insult. He is a
wicked boy, and much stronger than you; so that your ability (13) to
obtain this revenge may be doubtful.”</p>
<p>11．“I must own,” replied Philip, “that your advice seems very good.
So come along with me, and I will tell my father the whole matter, and I
think he will not be angry with me.” They went, and Philip told his
father what had happened. He thanked Stephen for the good advice he had
given his son, and promised Philip to give him another cane exactly like
the first.</p>
<p>12．A few days afterward, Philip saw this ill-natured boy fall as he
was carrying home a heavy log of wood, which he could not lift up again.
Philip ran to him, and helped him to replace it on his shoulder. Young
Robinson was quite ashamed at the thought of this unmerited kindness,
and heartily repented of his behavior. Philip went home quite satisfied.
“This,” said he, “is the noblest vengeance I could take, in returning
good for evil. It is impossible I should repent of it.”</p>

<p>1．“我会报仇的，我一定要让他从心底里后悔。”菲利普自言自语道，脸由于生气显得格外的红。他只顾着生气，也没看见来找他的斯蒂芬。</p>
<p>2．斯蒂芬说：“说谁呢？你打算找谁报仇？”菲利普仿佛从梦中惊醒，突然停下来看着他的朋友，他恢复了笑容，表情看起来自然了。“啊，你记得我的竹藤吗？我父亲给我的非常漂亮的一节。你记得吗？看，已成碎片了。是农夫罗宾逊的儿子把它弄成这样一钱不值。”</p>
<p>3．斯蒂芬非常冷静地问他，什么导致罗宾逊的儿子把竹藤弄碎的。他说：“我正好好地走着，一边走一边玩儿，把竹藤缠在身上。一不小心，竹藤的一头从我手里滑了出去，当时我正在门外的木桥边，这个坏家伙放了一罐水在地上，那是他从井里打上来要带回家的。”</p>
<p>4．“说来也巧，我的竹藤反弹回来，弄翻了罐子，不过没把它打碎。他冲到我旁边，开始点名道姓地骂我，我不停跟他说刚才真的不是故意的，我很抱歉。他根本不管我在说什么，立刻抓起我的竹藤，用力扭断了，这你也看见了。但是，我一定会让他后悔的。”</p>
<p>5．斯蒂芬说：“可以肯定，他是个顽皮的孩子，不过，成为一个没人喜欢、没人愿意和他有任何关系的人，对他来说已经是应有的惩罚了。他根本找不到能玩到一起的伙伴，通常对娱乐一窍不通。他活该。好好想想吧，我觉得这对你来说已经足以报仇雪恨了。”</p>
<p>6．“你说的都没错，”菲利普说，“但是，他弄坏了我的竹藤。这是我父亲给我的礼物，而且特别漂亮。我提议说要给他把罐子装满水，因为我不小心把罐子打翻。我要报仇。”</p>
<p>7．“听着，菲利普，”斯蒂芬说，“我觉得你不去和他一般见识会更好，因为你的蔑视是你能够惩罚他的最好方式。放心吧，你害他一尺，他会反过来害你一丈。现在想想，我告诉你前不久发生在他身上的一件事儿吧。</p>
<p>8．“那天他非常不幸，他看见一只蜜蜂停在一朵花上，他抓住蜜蜂，正要把翅膀揪下来，这只蜜蜂蜇了他一下，很快飞回蜂巢里去了。他疼得气急败坏，像你一样，他说要报复。他找来了一根棍子，戳向蜂巢。</p>
<p>9．“突然间，整个蜂群飞了出来，落在他身上，叮了足足有一百多处。他发出了恐怖的尖叫声，疼得在地上直打滚。很快他父亲跑过去，但根本没办法赶走蜜蜂，蜜蜂叮得严重到他不得不卧床几天。</p>
<p>10．“你看，他的报复没有成功。所以，我建议这件事就算了吧。他是个顽皮的孩子，又比你强壮，你的报复很难成功。”</p>
<p>11．菲利普说：“不得不承认，你的建议挺好的。跟我来吧，我会把一切告诉我的父亲，我想他不会生我的气。”他们离开，菲利普把事情告诉给他的父亲。父亲感谢斯蒂芬给他儿子的建议，还答应菲利普给他一个和原来一模一样的竹藤。</p>
<p>12．几天之后，菲利普看见这个调皮的孩子背着一捆很沉的木柴回家时摔倒在地，再也抬不起来了。菲利普跑过去，帮助他把木柴放到肩膀上。年轻的罗宾逊想到这份好意时，感觉很羞愧，他从心底里后悔自己的所作所为。菲利普很满足地回到家，他说：“以德报怨，这是我能做到的最高尚的报复。我绝对不会为此后悔的。”</p>

<h2 id="lesson-35-how-margery-wondered">LESSON 35 HOW MARGERY
WONDERED</h2>
<p>玛杰丽有多好奇</p>
<p>1．One bright morning late in March, little Margery put on her hood
and her Highland plaid shawl, and went trudging (1) across the beach. It
was the first time she had been trusted out alone, for Margery was a
little girl; nothing about her was large, except her round gray eyes,
which had yet scarcely opened upon half a dozen springs and summers.</p>
<p>2．There was a pale mist on the far-off sea and sky, and up around
the sun were white clouds edged with the hues (2) of pinks and violets.
The sunshine and the mild air made Margery’s very heart feel warm, and
she let the soft wind blow aside her Highland shawl, as she looked
across the waters at the sun, and wondered! For, somehow, the sun had
never looked before as it did to-day;—it seemed like a great golden
flower bursting out of its pearl-lined calyx (3) ,—a flower without a
stem. Or was there a strong stem away behind it in the sky, that reached
down below the sea, to a root, nobody could guess where?</p>
<p>3．Margery did not stop to puzzle herself about the answer to her
question, for now the tide, was coming in, and the waves, little at
first, but growing larger every moment, were crowding up along the sand
and pebbles, laughing, winking, and whispering, as they tumbled over
each other, like thousands of children hurrying home from somewhere,
each with its own precious little secret to tell.</p>
<p>4．Where did the waves come from? Who was down there under the blue
wall of the horizon (4) , with the hoarse, hollow voice, urging and
pushing them across the beach at her feet? And what secret was it they
were lisping to each other with their pleasant voices? Oh, what was
there beneath the sea, and beyond the sea, so deep, so broad, and so
dim, too, away off where the white ships, that looked smaller than sea
birds, were gliding out and in?</p>
<p>5．But while Margery stood still for a moment on a dry rock, and
wondered, there came a low, rippling warble (5) to her ear from a cedar
tree on the cliff above her. It had been a long winter, and Margery had
forgotten that there were birds, and that birds could sing. So she
wondered again what the music was.</p>
<p>6．And when she saw the bird perched on a yellow-brown bough, she
wondered yet more. It was only a bluebird, but then it was the first
bluebird Margery had ever seen. He fluttered among the prickly twigs,
and looked as if he had grown out of them, as the cedar berries had,
which were dusty blue, the color of his coat. But how did the music get
in his throat? And after it was in his throat, how could it untangle
itself, and wind itself off so evenly? And where had the bluebird flown
from, across the snow banks down to the shore of the blue sea?</p>
<p>7．The waves sang a welcome to him, and he sang a welcome to the
waves; they seemed to know each other well; and the ripple and the
warble sounded so much alike, the bird and the wave must have both
learned their music of the same teacher. And Margery kept on wondering
as she stepped between the song of the bluebird and the echo of the sea,
and climbed a sloping bank, just turning faintly green in the spring
sunshine.</p>
<p>8．The grass was surely beginning to grow! There were fresh, juicy
shoots running up among the withered blades of last year, as if in hopes
of bringing them back to life; and closer down she saw the sharp points
of new spears (6) peeping from their sheaths (7) . And scattered here
and there were small, dark green leaves folded around buds shut up so
tightly that only those who had watched them many seasons could tell
what flowers were to be let out of their safe prisons by and by. So no
one could blame Margery for not knowing that they were only common
things, nor for stooping over the tiny buds, and wondering.</p>
<p>9．What made the grass come up so green out of the black earth? And
how did the buds know when it was time to take off their little green
hoods, and see what there was in the world around them? And how came
they to be buds at all? Did they bloom in another world before they
sprung up here?—and did they know, themselves, what kind of flowers they
should blossom into? Had flowers souls, like little girls, that would
live in another world when their forms had faded away in this?</p>
<p>10．Margery thought she would like to sit down on the bank, and wait
beside the buds until they opened; perhaps they would tell her their
secret if the very first thing they saw was her eyes watching them. One
bud was beginning to unfold; it was streaked with yellow in little
stripes that she could imagine became wider every minute. But she would
not touch it, for it seemed almost as much alive as herself. She only
wondered, and wondered!</p>
<p>11．Margery heard her mother calling her, and she trudged home across
the shells and pebbles with a pleasant smile dimpling her cheeks; for
she felt very much at home in this large, wonderful world, and was happy
to be alive, although she neither could have told, nor cared to know,
the reason why. But when her mother unpinned the little girl’s Highland
shawl, and took off her hood, she said, “O mother, do let me live on the
doorstep! I don’t like houses to stay in. What makes everything so
pretty and so glad? Don’t you like to wonder?”</p>
<p>12．Margery’s mother was a good woman. But then there was all the
housework to do, and, if she had thoughts, she did not often let them
wander outside of the kitchen door. And just now she was baking some
gingerbread, which was in danger of getting burned in the oven. So she
pinned the shawl around the child’s neck again, and left her on the
doorstep, saying to herself, as she returned to her work, “Queer child!
I wonder what kind of a woman she will be!”</p>
<p>13．But Margery sat on the doorstep, and wondered, as the sea sounded
louder, and the sunshine grew warmer around her. It was all so strange,
and grand, and beautiful! Her heart danced with joy to the music that
went echoing through the wide world from the roots of the sprouting
grass to the great golden blossom of the sun.</p>
<p>14．And when the round, gray eyes closed that night, at the first
peep of the stars, the angels looked down and wondered over Margery. For
the wisdom of the wisest being God has made, ends in wonder; and there
is nothing on earth so wonderful as the budding soul of a little
child.</p>
<p>(Lucy Larcom)</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Name the things about which Margery wondered. What did she
wonder about each? What is still more wonderful than all that at which
Margery wondered?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-275">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．三月末一个明媚的早晨，小玛杰丽穿上帽衫，围上苏格兰格子围巾，步履蹒跚沿着海滩走着。这是她第一次单独出门，因为她还是个很小的小女孩。除了她那双圆圆的灰色眼睛，她的五官都不大。在过去的六年里，她几乎都没见过什么。</p>
<p>2．远处海天交汇的地方是薄薄的迷雾，天空之上太阳被镶有粉色和紫色光晕的云朵环绕。阳光和温和的空气让玛杰丽感觉非常温暖，她让微风吹着她的苏格兰围巾，一边望向大海深处的太阳，充满着好奇。因为她觉得仿佛太阳从未如今天一般照耀——看起来就像从珍珠边的花萼里绽放的金色花朵——一朵没有根茎的花。也或者在它后面的天空上，有着巨大的枝干，向下伸入海底扎根，只是无人知晓在哪里。</p>
<p>3．玛杰丽并没有为思考自己提出的这个问题而伤脑筋，现在海潮涌来，浪花拍打着海岸，先是小浪花，越来越大，越来越大，沿着沙子和鹅卵石聚集起来，一个接一个地，欢笑着，眨巴眼睛，窃窃私语，就像成千上万的孩子们从某个地方奔跑着回家，每个都有自己的小秘密要讲。</p>
<p>4．浪花从哪儿来的？蓝色的水平线下，是谁在咆哮着、低吟着，追赶着它们到海滩上，直到她脚下呢？它们轻声细语和对方说的又是什么秘密呢？哦，在海的下面到底是什么啊？在海的尽头到底是什么？海那么深，那么广，又那么暗淡。远处白色的船舶，看起来比海鸟还小，是不是正在航行着？</p>
<p>5．玛杰丽在干燥的岩石上静静地坐着，非常好奇，这时她听到低低的柔和的鸟叫声如流水泛起涟漪般从她头顶悬崖上的雪松树上传来。这年冬天很漫长，玛杰丽几乎忘记了还有鸟儿的存在，忘记了鸟儿还会鸣叫。她又好奇起来这是什么音乐。</p>
<p>6．当她看见一只鸟停在黄褐色的枝头时，她更加好奇了。这仅仅是一只蓝知更鸟，但这是玛杰丽看到的第一只蓝知更鸟。这鸟在荆棘枝头扑扇翅膀，就像刚从枝头长出来似的，因为雪松树的松果是土蓝色，和蓝知更鸟的颜色非常相近。但是，音乐是怎么进到它喉咙里的呢？音乐进到它的喉咙之后，又怎么重获自由，然后如此自由释放呢？这蓝知更鸟是从哪儿飞来的？飞越皑皑雪山，飞到蓝色海岸。</p>
<p>7．海浪歌唱着欢迎它，它也歌唱着欢迎海浪；它们仿佛早已熟悉对方，海浪声和鸟鸣声如此相似，鸟和海浪肯定师从同一位老师学习唱歌。玛杰丽行走在鸟的婉转歌声和海浪的回声之间，不停地想象着，她爬上了一段倾斜的海岸，这里在春日的阳光下刚刚有了淡淡绿意。</p>
<p>8．青草已经开始生长。去年枯萎的叶片中冒出清新嫩绿的芽，仿佛希望它们能重获新生。再近一点，她看到新芽尖尖的芽尖已经从外鞘冒了出来。地上星星点点的，是深绿色叶子紧紧包裹的花蕾，只有常年观察过它们的人才能辨别出从这安全的“监牢”里，不久后会开出什么样的花朵。所以，我们也无法责备玛杰丽不仅不知道这些只是寻常之物，还弯腰好奇地看着这些小花蕾。</p>
<p>9．什么使小草从黑魆魆的土壤中长出来，却又如此绿油油呢？花蕾怎么知道什么时候它们能够脱去小小的绿色外套，来看看周围的世界？甚至它们到底是怎么变成花蕾的？它们在这儿绽放之前，是不是也曾在另一个世界绽放过——它们自己是否知道，它们应该开成哪种花朵？花朵有灵魂吗？就像小女孩，当它们在这个世界的躯体凋零后，灵魂在另一个世界还会活着吗？</p>
<p>10．玛杰丽想她愿意在岸边坐下来，等在花蕾旁边，等待它们绽放；也许当它们最先看到的是她注视的眼睛，它们就会把这些秘密告诉她。一朵花蕾正要绽放，花蕾上黄色条纹越来越明显，玛杰丽能想象它每一分钟都在向外展开。但是，她不能碰，因为花蕾看起来就像她一样，是有生命的。她只是好奇地想啊，想啊！</p>
<p>11．玛杰丽听到她母亲在喊她，于是她磕磕绊绊地穿过满布贝壳和碎石的岸边，回到家里，脸颊上挂着满意的微笑，因为在这个奇妙的世界里她感觉自由自在，虽然她不明白，也并不在乎活着的原因，但她很高兴可以活着。但是，当她母亲把这小女孩的苏格兰围巾解开，摘下她的头巾时，她说：“哦，妈妈，就让我住在门口吧！我不喜欢待在房子里。是什么让这一切如此美丽，如此美好呢？难道你不想知道吗？”</p>
<p>12．玛杰丽的母亲是个善良的人。但是，她有很多家务要做，如果她有什么想法，也不会在厨房外胡思乱想的。这时，她正在烤姜饼蛋糕，眼看着就要烤糊了。所以，她又把玛杰丽的围巾围上，把她留在门外台阶上，接着做她的家务活，同时她自言自语：“好奇怪的孩子，我很好奇她将来会成为什么样的女人。”</p>
<p>13．玛杰丽坐在台阶上，好奇地思考着。海浪声越来越大，太阳温暖地照耀着她。这一切都是如此神奇，又如此壮观，如此美丽！从发芽的草根，到太阳开出的金色花朵，这浩渺世界的一切都回响着美妙的音乐，而她的心，随着音乐舞动着。</p>
<p>14．那天夜里，这圆圆的灰色眼睛闭上后，天使伴随着星空的出现，向下好奇地看着玛杰丽。因为上帝创造的最智慧的生物，在惊奇中结束。世界上没有什么比一个孩子正在萌芽的心灵更为奇妙了。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-37-susies-composition">LESSON 37 SUSIE’S COMPOSITION</h2>
<p>苏西的作文</p>
<p>1．Susie Smith came home from school one day, and had no sooner
entered the sitting room than she burst into tears. “What is the matter,
my dear child?” said her mother, drawing her daughter to her side and
smiling.</p>
<p>2．“O mother, matter enough,” sobbed Susie. “All our class must bring
in compositions (1) to-morrow morning, and I never, never can write one.
We must write twelve lines at least, and I have written only a few words
after trying nearly all the afternoon. See what work I have made of
it!”</p>
<p>3．Mrs. Smith took the rumpled (2) , tear-stained paper which Susie
held in her hand, and glanced at what she had written. In a careful hand
she had tried to write upon three themes (3) : “Time,” “Temperance,” and
“Industry.”</p>
<p>4．“Time is short. We should all improve our time.” “Temperance is a
very useful thing.” “We should all be industrious if we wish to do
anything in the world.” These sentences were all she had written.</p>
<p>5．“Now,” said Susie, “I can’t think of another word to say upon any
of these subjects, and I know I shall have to go to school without a
composition, for I won’t be so mean as to copy one from a book, or to
ask you or papa to write one for me.”</p>
<p>6．“That is right, my dear,” said her mother. “You will be far
happier with a poor composition, if it is all your own, than with a fine
one written by somebody else. But cheer up. You have not begun right—you
have been trying to write upon subjects that you know nothing about. Run
into the garden and play. I will call you in half an hour.”</p>
<p>7．“But my composition,” began Susie. “Don’t think about your
composition while you are gone,” said Mrs. Smith, “but have as pleasant
a time as you can.”</p>
<p>8．It seemed but a few minutes to Susie before she heard her mother’s
voice calling her. She went into the house at once—her hands full of
sweet flowers, and her cheeks rosy with exercise.</p>
<p>9．“Now, Susie,” said her mother, “I want you to sit by the window
with this nice sheet of paper and a pencil, and write something about
what you can see.” “But my composition, mother,” said Susie; “when shall
I begin that?” “Never mind your composition, my dear; do this to please
me, and we will talk about that by and by.”</p>
<p>10．Susie thought her mother’s request (4) was a strange one; but she
knew that she always had a good reason for everything she did: so she
took the paper and pencil, and sat by the window.</p>
<p>11．“Do not talk to me at all,” said her mother. “Look out of the
window, and then write down your thoughts about everything you see.”</p>
<p>12．Susie could not help laughing, it seemed such a funny thing to be
doing. As she looked out, she first saw the western sky and some bright,
sunset clouds. “O mother!” she exclaimed, “what a splendid sunset!”
“Don’t talk,” said her mother, “but write.”</p>
<p>13．“I’ll write about the sunset, then,” said she, and the pencil
began to move rapidly across the paper. In a few moments she said,
“Mother, shall I read you what I have written?” “No, not now,” answered
her mother; “I am going into the dining room. You may sit and write
until I return.”</p>
<p>14．As Susie went on writing, she became very much interested in her
occupation (5) , and for a time forgot all about the dreaded
composition. She wrote about the sunset clouds, the appearance of the
distant hills, the trees, the river, the garden with its gay flowers,
and the birds flying past the window.</p>
<p>15．Just as she had reached the bottom of the page, her mother came
in. “Well, Susie,” said she, with a smile, “how does that composition
come on?” “Composition!” exclaimed Susie; “you told me not to think
about my composition, and I have not thought of it once; I have had such
a nice time writing about what I could see from the window.”</p>
<p>16．Mrs. Smith took the paper and read aloud what Susie had written:
“I am sitting on a low seat at the bay window, one half of which is
open, so that I can smell the sweet flowers in the garden. The sky is
all bright with sunset; I can see purple, and pink, and golden. I do not
believe that anyone on earth has a paint box with such lovely colors in
it.</p>
<p>17．“I can see one cloud, far above the rest, that looks like a ship
sailing in the blue sea. I should like to sail on a cloud, if it would
not make me dizzy. Now, while I have been writing, the clouds have
changed in color and form, but they are just as beautiful as they were
before.</p>
<p>18．“The green hills are tipped with light, and look as if they were
wearing golden crowns. I can see a river a great way off, and it looks
quite still, although I know it is running as fast as it can to get to
the ocean.</p>
<p>19．“The birds are flying past the window to go home and take care of
their little ones. I am glad the birds are not afraid to live in our
garden, and to build nests in our trees.</p>
<p>20．“Our garden is full of flowers—pinks, lilies, and roses. Mother
calls this the month of roses. My birthday will come in a week, and we
can have all the flowers we wish for wreaths and bouquets (6) .”</p>
<p>21．“There, Susie,” said Mrs. Smith, “that is a very nice
composition, indeed.” “A composition!” exclaimed Susie, “is that a
composition?” “Yes, my dear, and a very good one, too,” replied her
mother. “When it hasn’t even a subject?”</p>
<p>22．“We can find one for it, and I do not doubt it will please your
teacher, as it does me. You see, my dear,” continued her mother, “that
it is easy enough to write if you have anything interesting to write
about.”</p>
<p>23．The next morning Susie copied her composition very neatly, and
started to school with a happy heart, saying, as she gave her mother a
kiss, “Just think how funny it is, dear mother, that I should have
written so long a composition without knowing it.”</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is a composition? Why was Susie so troubled? Why
could she not write about “Time,” “Temperance,” or “Industry”? What did
her mother have her do? What did Susie write? Was it a composition? Did
she know, at the time, that it was? What fault did she find with it? Can
you give her composition a proper subject?</p>

<p>1．一天，苏西·史密斯放学回到家，还没进门就哭了起来。“因为什么事啊，我的小宝贝？”她母亲微笑着把女儿拉到身边，亲切地问。</p>
<p>2．“哦，妈妈，相当重要的事。”苏西哭着说：“明天早晨去上学我们班所有人都得交一篇作文，可我一直都写不出来。我们至少要写十二行，我写了一下午，才写了几个词。您看看我写的。”</p>
<p>3．史密斯夫人拿过苏西手上皱皱巴巴、泪迹斑斑的作业纸，看了一眼她都写了什么。她非常认真地，试着写了三个主题：“时间”、“节制”、“勤奋”。</p>
<p>4．“时间很短暂。我们应该提高对时间的利用。”“节制对我们很有用。”“如果我们要在世界上做任何事，我们都得勤奋。”这些是她写下来的所有句子。</p>
<p>5．苏西说：“看吧，对这几个主题，我再也想不出一个字来了。我明天去学校肯定交不出作文来。因为我不会差到从书上抄一篇或者让你或爸爸帮我写一篇。”</p>
<p>6．“你说得对，我的宝贝，”她母亲说，“只要是你自己写的作文，即使很差，也比你拿一篇别人写的好作文要快乐得多。振作起来。你开始写作文的方法不对——你一直想写些你不熟悉的主题。你跑去花园里玩一会儿，半个小时之后我叫你回来。”</p>
<p>7．“那我的作文怎么办啊？”苏西问。史密斯夫人告诉她：“去玩的时候别想着你的作文，尽情地玩耍吧。”</p>
<p>8．苏西感觉只玩了一小会儿，就听到妈妈叫她的声音。她立刻回到屋里——双手握满鲜花，脸颊跑得通红。</p>
<p>9．她母亲说：“来，苏西，你现在坐在窗户旁，用这张好纸和这支铅笔，写下你所看见的东西。”“那我的作文怎么办啊？我什么时候开始写呢？”苏西问。“别担心你的作文，宝贝。先写这个我看看，我们一步一步来。”</p>
<p>10．苏西觉得她母亲的要求很奇怪，不过她觉得妈妈让她做任何一件事都是有道理的，于是她拿过纸笔，坐在窗户边。</p>
<p>11．她母亲说：“不要和我说话。看看窗户外面，写下你看到的一切的想法。”</p>
<p>12．苏西忍不住笑了起来，这真是一件好玩的事儿。向外望去，她先看见西边的天空，点缀着明亮的落日云。“哦，妈妈！多美丽壮观的落日啊！”她欢呼起来。“别和我说，试着写下来。”她母亲说。</p>
<p>13．“那我就写落日吧。”苏西说。铅笔在纸上快速移动。过了一会儿，她说：“妈妈，我能给你念念我写的吗？”“不用，现在还不用，”她母亲说，“我现在要去厨房，你可以写到我回来。”</p>
<p>14．苏西接着写，她开始喜欢她现在做的事了，一度忘了她那可怕的作文。她写了落日的云朵，写了远山、树木、河流、鲜花朵朵的花园，还写了飞过窗外的飞鸟。</p>
<p>15．就快写到这页最下面时，她的母亲进来了，微笑着问她：“苏西，你的作文写得怎么样了？”“作文！”苏西大叫起来，“你告诉我不要想着我的作文的，我就一点儿都没想。我正高高兴兴地写我从窗户里看到的东西呢。”</p>
<p>16．史密斯夫人拿过作文纸，大声读出苏西刚才写的句子：“我现在坐在窗边的矮凳上，窗的一半打开着，我能闻到花园里香甜的花朵。天空因为落日非常明亮，我能看见紫色、粉色和金色。我觉得地球上没有人有这样的画笔，能调出这么可爱的颜色。</p>
<p>17．“我能看到一朵云，它比其他的云都要高，看起来就像轮船航行在蓝蓝的海上。如果坐着不晕的话，我想要坐在一朵云上。现在，一边写，云彩的颜色和形状都变了，但还是和刚才一样漂亮。</p>
<p>18．“翠绿的山顶闪着光，看起来就像戴着金色的皇冠。我能看见很远的地方有条河，虽然看起来是静止的，不过我知道河水正奔流着冲向大海呢。</p>
<p>19．“几只鸟从窗边飞过，它们要飞回家照顾它们的幼鸟。我很高兴鸟儿们住在我们的花园里不害怕，它们还在我家树上筑了巢。</p>
<p>20．“我家花园里种满了花：石竹花、百合花，还有玫瑰花。妈妈说这个月是玫瑰月。下周就是我的生日了，到时候我们可以用这些花来做花环和花束。”</p>
<p>21．史密斯夫人说：“看啊，苏西，这就是一篇很好的作文，真的。”“一篇作文，这是作文吗？”苏西不相信地问。“是的，我的宝贝，这是一篇很好的作文。”她的母亲这样回复。“这连个主题都没有，可以吗？”</p>
<p>22．“我们可以找个主题。我相信你的老师肯定会像我一样喜欢这篇作文的，”她母亲继续说，“你看，宝贝，如果要写你感兴趣的东西，写作是非常简单的。”</p>
<p>23．第二天一早，苏西工工整整地抄写了她的作文，开开心心地要去上学。她在妈妈脸上亲了一口，说：“亲爱的妈妈，你看这多有意思啊。不知不觉，我竟然写了这么长的一篇作文。”</p>

<h2 id="lesson-39-consequences-of-idleness">LESSON 39 CONSEQUENCES OF
IDLENESS</h2>
<p>懒惰的后果</p>
<p>1．Many young persons seem to think it of not much consequence (1) if
they do not improve their time well in youth, vainly expecting that they
can make it up by diligence when they are older. They also think it is
disgraceful for men and women to be idle, but that there can be no harm
for persons who are young to spend their time in any manner they
please.</p>
<p>2．George Jones thought so. When he was twelve years old, he went to
an academy (2) to prepare to enter college (3) . His father was at great
expense in obtaining books for him, clothing him, and paying his
tuition. But George was idle. The preceptor (4) of the academy would
often tell him that if he did not study diligently when young he would
never succeed well.</p>
<p>3．But George thought of nothing but present pleasure. He would often
go to school without having made any preparation (5) for his morning
lesson; and, when called to recite with his class, he would stammer and
make such blunders that the rest of the class could not help laughing at
him. He was one of the poorest scholars in the school, because he was
one of the most idle.</p>
<p>4．When recess came, and all the boys ran out of the academy upon the
playground, idle George would come moping along. Instead of studying
diligently while in school, he was indolent and half asleep. When the
proper time for play came, he had no relish for it. I recollect very
well, that, when “tossing up” for a game of ball, we used to choose
everybody on the playground before we chose George; and if there were
enough without him we used to leave him out. Thus he was unhappy in
school and out of school.</p>
<p>5．There is nothing which makes a person enjoy play so well as to
study hard. When recess was over, and the rest of the boys returned,
fresh and vigorous (6) , to their studies, George might be seen lagging
and moping along to his seat. Sometimes he would be asleep in school;
sometimes he would pass his time in catching flies, and penning them up
in little holes, which he cut in his seat; and sometimes, when the
preceptor’s back was turned, he would throw a paper ball across the
room.</p>
<p>6．When the class was called up to recite, George would come drowsily
along, looking as mean and ashamed as though he were going to be
whipped. The rest of the class stepped up to the recitation with
alacrity (7) , and appeared happy and contented. When it came George’s
turn to recite, he would be so long in doing it, and make such blunders,
that all most heartily wished him out of the class.</p>
<p>7．At last, George went with his class to enter college. Though he
passed a very poor examination, he was admitted with the rest; for those
who examined him thought it was possible that the reason why he did not
answer questions better was because he was frightened. Now came hard
times for poor George. In college there is not much mercy shown to bad
scholars; and George had neglected his studies so long that he could not
now keep up with his class, let him try ever so hard.</p>
<p>8．He could, without much difficulty, get along in the academy, where
there were only two or three boys of his own class to laugh at him. But
now he had to go into a large recitation room, filled with students from
all parts of the country. In the presence of all these, he must rise and
recite to a professor (8) . Poor fellow! He paid dearly for his
idleness.</p>
<p>9．You would have pitied him if you could have seen him trembling in
his scat, every moment expecting to be called upon to recite. And when
he was called upon, he would stand up and take what the class called a
“dead set;” that is, he could not recite at all. Sometimes he would make
such ludicrous (9) blunders that the whole class would burst into a
laugh. Such are the applauses (10) an idler gets. He was wretched, of
course. He had been idle so long that he hardly knew how to apply his
mind to study. All the good scholars avoided him; they were ashamed to
be seen in his company. He became discouraged, and gradually grew
dissipated (11) .</p>
<p>10．The officers of the college were soon compelled to suspend him.
He returned in a few months, but did no better; and his father was then
advised to take him from college. He left college, despised by everyone.
A few months ago, I met him, a poor wanderer, without money and without
friends. Such are the wages of idleness. I hope every reader will, from
this history, take warning, and “stamp improvement (12) on the wings of
time.”</p>

<p>1．很多年轻人认为，年轻时不好好利用时间并不会产生不良后果，只是徒劳地寄希望于长大后通过勤劳努力来弥补。尽管他们也觉得懒惰对于男人和女人来说都是件不光彩的事，但是对于年轻人来说，用他们喜欢的方式安排时间也没有什么害处。</p>
<p>2．乔治·琼斯也这么觉得。十二岁的时候，他进入一所学校准备考大学。他的父亲花费了很多钱来给他买书、买衣服、付学费。但是，乔治很懒惰。学校的老师经常对他说，如果他小时候不好好学习，以后他不会成功的。</p>
<p>3．但是，乔治什么也不想，只想着眼前的快乐。他常常不做任何预习就到学校上早课，一叫他背诵课文，他就结结巴巴总犯错，班上的其他学生总笑话他。他在学校是学习最差的学生，就因为他总是很懒惰。</p>
<p>4．课间休息时，其他的男孩们跑出教室，到操场上，懒惰的乔治总是慢吞吞地挪过去。在上课的时候他不认真学习，总是懒洋洋的，还经常犯困。到真正玩耍的时间，他也享受不到其中的快乐。我清清楚楚地记得，每当玩球要掷硬币分组时，我们通常会先选操场上的其他人，最后才选乔治；如果不用选他，人数已经够了，我们就把他甩在一边。这样，他在课上和课下都不开心。</p>
<p>5．对一个人来说，只有在努力学习之后，才能最好地享受玩耍的乐趣。课间休息结束时，其他的男孩子都精神饱满、活力无限地回去学习，而乔治总是磨磨蹭蹭、慢吞吞地回到他的座位。有时候他会在课堂上睡觉，有时候也会抓苍蝇消磨时间，然后把它们关在刻在椅子上的小洞里。还有些时候，当老师转过身去背对他们时，他会把一个纸团扔到教室另一边。</p>
<p>6．老师让同学们背诵课文时，乔治总是懒洋洋地应付，看上去非常差劲，令人惭愧，仿佛他要挨鞭子似的。其他同学加快了背诵的速度，既高兴又满足。轮到乔治背时，他花的时间可长了，背得磕磕绊绊的，所有人都由衷地希望把他赶出教室。</p>
<p>7．最后，乔治和他的同学们一起考入了大学。尽管他考试的成绩很差，他还是和其他人一样被录取了，因为考官觉得他没能很好地回答问题的原因可能是他太紧张了。现在乔治的苦日子要来了。大学里，人们对差学生可没那么仁慈了，乔治放松学习的时间太长了，他根本就跟不上课，他还得更加努力地学习。</p>
<p>8．高中的时候乔治凑合着过活还不难，那时候只有自己班里两三个男生嘲笑他，但现在他是在一间非常大的诵读教室里，里面坐着来自全国各地的学生。当着所有人的面，他必须得站起来，给大学老师背诵。可怜的家伙，他为懒惰付出了高昂的代价。</p>
<p>9．如果你看见他在自己的座位上浑身颤抖着，时刻等着点名背诵时，你可能会可怜他。被点名后，他站起来，用全班同学戏称为“死套路”的办法，那就是，他根本一点都不会背。有时候他会犯些莫名其妙的错误，惹得全班哄堂大笑。这是对一个懒惰的家伙喝的倒彩。当然，他也很难受。他已经懒散惯了，甚至不知道怎么才能把脑子用在学习上。所有的好学生都躲着他，他们都觉得和他在一起很丢脸。他心灰意冷，慢慢地开始自暴自弃。</p>
<p>10．很快，学校的领导不得不让他停课。几个月后，他回到学校，不过没什么好转。有人建议他父亲把他从学校带走，所以他在大家的鄙视中离开了大学校园。几个月后，我偶然遇见他，一个可怜的流浪汉，没有钱，也没有朋友。这就是懒惰的代价。我希望每个读者从这个故事中能够引以为戒，能够在时间之翼上记录下成长和进步的印记。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-40-advantages-of-industry">LESSON 40 ADVANTAGES OF
INDUSTRY</h2>
<p>勤奋的益处</p>
<p>1．I gave you, in the last lesson, the history (1) of George Jones,
an idle boy, and showed you the consequences of his idleness. I shall
now give you the history of Charles Bullard, a classmate of George.
Charles was about the same age as George, and did not possess superior
talents. Indeed, I doubt whether he was equal to him in natural powers
of mind.</p>
<p>2．But Charles was a hard student. When quite young, he was always
careful and diligent in school. Sometimes, when there was a very hard
lesson, instead of going out to play during recess, he would stay in to
study. He had resolved that his first object should be to get his
lessons well, and then he could play with a good conscience (2) . He
loved play as well as anybody, and was one of the best players on the
ground. I hardly ever saw any boy catch a ball better than he could.
When playing any game (3) , everyone was glad to get Charles on his
side.</p>
<p>3．I have said that Charles would sometimes stay in at recess. This,
however, was very seldom; it was only when the lessons were very hard
indeed. Generally, he was among the first on the playground, and he was
also among the first to go into school when called. Hard study gave him
a relish for play, and play again gave him a relish for hard study; so
he was happy both in school and out. The preceptor could not help liking
him, for he always had his lessons well committed (4) , and never gave
him any trouble.</p>
<p>4．When he went to enter college, the preceptor gave him a good
recommendation (5) . He was able to answer all the questions which were
put to him when he was examined. He had studied so well when he was in
the academy, and was so thoroughly prepared for college, that he found
it very easy to keep up with his class, and had much time for reading
interesting books.</p>
<p>5．But he would always get his lesson well before he did anything
else, and would review (6) it just before recitation. When called upon
to recite, he rose tranquil (7) and happy, and very seldom made
mistakes. The officers of the college had a high opinion of him, and he
was respected by all the students.</p>
<p>6．There was, in the college, a society made up of all the best
scholars. Charles was chosen a member of that society. It was the custom
to choose some one of the society to deliver a public address every
year. This honor was conferred (8) on Charles; and he had studied so
diligently, and read so much, that he delivered an address which was
very interesting to all who heard it.</p>
<p>7．At last he graduated (9) , as it is called; that is, he finished
his collegiate course, and received his degree. It was known by all that
he was a good scholar, and by all that he was respected. His father and
mother, brothers and sisters, came on the commencement (10) day to hear
him speak.</p>
<p>8．They all felt gratified, and loved Charles more than ever. Many
situations of usefulness and profit were opened to him; for Charles was
now an intelligent man, and universally (11) respected. He is still a
useful and a happy man. He has a cheerful home, and is esteemed by all
who know him.</p>
<p>9．Such are the rewards of industry. How strange it is that any
person should be willing to live in idleness when it will certainly make
him unhappy! The idle boy is almost invariably (12) poor and miserable;
the industrious boy is happy and prosperous.</p>
<p>10．But perhaps some child who reads this, asks, “Does God notice
little children in school?” He certainly does. And if you are not
diligent in the improvement of your time, it is one of the surest
evidences (13) that your heart is not right with God. You are placed in
this world to improve your time. In youth you must be preparing for
future usefulness. And if you do not improve the advantages (14) you
enjoy, you sin against your Maker.</p>
<p>With books, or work, or healthful play,</p>
<p>Let your first years be passed;</p>
<p>That you may give, for every day,</p>
<p>Some good account, at last.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What was the character of George Jones? Of Charles
Bullard? How did George appear in the class at school? How did he behave
at recess? How did Charles differ from him in these respects? Relate
what happened when George went to college. What became of him? Did
Charles succeed at college? Which of them do you think more worthy of
imitation? What is said of the idle? What is said of the industrious?
Who watches all our actions wherever we may be? For what are we placed
in this world? Should you not then be diligent in your studies?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-280">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．上一课，我们讲了懒惰的孩子乔治·琼斯的经历，让你们知道懒惰有什么后果。现在我要给你们讲讲乔治·琼斯的同学查尔斯·布拉德的事情。查尔斯和乔治年龄差不多，并没有什么过人的天赋。实际上我甚至怀疑在智力上他可能都不如乔治。</p>
<p>2．但查尔斯特别刻苦。很小的时候，他就很认真勤奋。有时候，如果学了很难的一课，课间休息的时候他就不出去玩儿，而是待在教室里继续学习。他认定了自己的第一目标是要把课学好，然后才能安安心心地玩。他和其他人一样喜爱玩耍，也是操场里玩得最好的人之一。我没见过有谁能比他接球接得更好。每次比赛的时候，大家都喜欢和查尔斯在一组。</p>
<p>3．我刚才说到，有时候课间休息时查尔斯会在教室学习。不过，这种情况很少，只是在课程非常难的时候才会这样。一般情况下，他是第一个到操场上，同样也是第一个回来上课的。刻苦学习让他享受玩耍的乐趣，而玩耍也是努力学习的调剂。所以他在课上课下都很开心。老师自然喜欢他，因为他功课总是很好，从来也不惹麻烦。</p>
<p>4．上了大学之后，老师对他的评价很高。每次考试的时候，他总是能够回答出所有问题。高中的时候他就学得非常好，为大学学习做了充分的准备。在大学里听课，他也很容易跟上进度，这样就有很多时间阅读有趣的书籍。</p>
<p>5．不过，他总是在做任何其他事之前先把功课做好，也会在背诵之前好好复习。点名背诵的时候，他从容又愉悦地站起来，几乎很少犯错。大学里的领导对他的评价非常高，其他的学生都非常尊敬他。</p>
<p>6．大学里有个由成绩最好的学生们组成的社团。查尔斯被选为这个社团的成员。这个社团有个传统，每年都会选出一位成员来进行一次公开演讲。查尔斯获得了这项殊荣。因为他学习非常刻苦，又阅读了大量书籍，所以他的演讲对每个听众来说都非常有趣。</p>
<p>7．最后，他毕业了，也就是说，他完成了大学的学分，还获得了学位。所有人都知道他是个好学生，都很尊敬他。他的父亲母亲、兄弟姐妹都来参加他的毕业典礼，听他的演讲。</p>
<p>8．他们都觉得非常感恩，比以往任何时候都更爱查尔斯。很多好的工作都向查尔斯敞开了大门，因为查尔斯已经是能力很强的人，且被众人尊敬。他是一个对社会有益并非常幸福的人。他有一个快乐的家庭，被每个认识他的人敬重。</p>
<p>9．这就是勤奋的回报。懒惰只会让自己不幸福，还有人愿意懒惰地度过一生，这是多么奇怪啊。懒惰的人总是贫穷、可怜，而勤奋的人总是幸福且富足。</p>
<p>10．但是，可能有的孩子看到这儿会问：“上帝注意到在学校上课的孩子们吗？”他当然注意。如果你不能很好地利用时间，这就说明你的心没有和上帝在一起。你来到这个世界上，就要合理地利用自己的时间。年轻的时候，你需要为未来打好基础。如果你不能抓住机会，好好利用时间，你就是在对造物主犯罪。</p>
<p>读书、工作或者健康地游戏，</p>
<p>让你年轻时的岁月如此度过；</p>
<p>最后，你就会</p>
<p>知道之前的努力是多么有意义。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-42-coffee">LESSON 42 COFFEE</h2>
<p>咖啡</p>
<p>1．The coffee tree is a native of eastern Africa, but it was in
Arabia that it first became known to the people of Europe, and until
about the year 1700 A. D. that country afforded (1) the entire
supply.</p>
<p>2．Then the coffee seeds found their way to Java, by means of some
traders, and one of the first plants grown on that island was sent as a
present to the governor of the Dutch East India Company, who lived in
Holland.</p>
<p>3．It was planted in the Botanical Gardens at Amsterdam, and in a few
years seeds taken from it were sent to South America, where the
cultivation of coffee has steadily increased, extending to the West
Indies, until now the offspring (2) of this one plant produce more
coffee than is obtained from all the other plants in the world.</p>
<p>4．The plant is an evergreen, and is from six to twelve feet high,
the stem being from ten to fifteen inches in diameter. The lower
branches bend down when the tree begins to grow old, and extend
themselves into a round form somewhat like an umbrella; and the wood is
so pliable (3) that the ends of the largest branches may be bent down to
within two or three feet of the earth.</p>
<p>5．The bark is whitish and somewhat rough. A tree is never without
leaves, which are at small distances from one another, and on almost
opposite sides of a bough. Blossoms and green and ripe fruit may be seen
on the same tree at the same time. When the blossom falls off, there
grows in its place a small green fruit, which becomes dark red as it
ripens.</p>
<p>6．This fruit is not unlike a cherry, and is very good to eat. Under
the pulp of this cherry is found the bean or berry we call coffee,
wrapped in a fine, thin skin. The berry is at first very soft, and has a
bad taste; but as the cherry ripens the berry grows harder, and the
dried-up fruit becomes a shell or pod of a deep brown color.</p>
<p>7．The berry is now solid, and its color is a translucent (4) green.
Each shell contains two seeds, rounded on one side and flat on the
other. The seeds lie with the flat sides together, and, in one highly
prized variety, the two seeds grow together, forming one: this is known
as the pea berry. When the fruit is so ripe that it can be shaken from
the tree, the husks are separated from the berries, and are used, in
Arabia, by the natives, while the berries are sold.</p>
<p>8．The young plants are inserted in holes from twelve to eighteen
inches deep, and six or eight feet apart. If left to themselves, they
would grow to the height of eighteen or twenty feet; but they are
usually dwarfed by pruning (5) , so that the fruit may be easily got at
by the gatherer.</p>
<p>9．Thus dwarfed, they extend their branches until they cover the
whole space about them. They begin to yield fruit the third year. By the
sixth or seventh year they are at full bearing, and continue to bear for
twenty years or more.</p>
<p>l0．Before the berry can be used, it undergoes a process of roasting.
The amount of aromatic (6) oil brought out in roasting has much to do
with the market value of coffee, and it has been found that the longer
the raw coffee is kept, the richer it becomes in this peculiar oil, and
so the more valuable. But after the coffee is roasted, and especially
after it is ground, it loses its aroma rapidly.</p>
<p>11．Arabia produces the celebrated Mocha, or “Mokha,” coffee, which
is the finest in the world; but little or none of the best product is
ever taken out of that country. The Java coffee from the East Indies is
next prized, but the best quality of this kind is also quite difficult
to obtain, and many, therefore, prefer the finest grades of Rio coffee
from South America to such Mocha and Java as can be had in our
country.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What country first supplied coffee? How did the plant come
to be grown in other countries? Describe the plant. What is said of the
fruit? How are the plants cultivated? What is said about the roasting of
coffee? What are the three principal kinds of coffee used, and how are
they valued?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-282">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．咖啡树原产于非洲东部，但最初是在阿拉伯首先为欧洲人所知，直到公元1700年前后，阿拉伯地区承担起全部的供应。</p>
<p>2．然后，咖啡种子通过贸易商的传播到了爪哇国，之后这个岛屿上生长的第一株咖啡树被当作礼物送给了居住在荷兰的东印度公司管理者那里。</p>
<p>3．送来的咖啡树种在阿姆斯特丹的植物花园里，几年之后，树上取下的种子被带到了南美，在南美，咖啡种植逐步增长，扩展到了西印度群岛。直到现在，这棵咖啡树的后代所出产的咖啡比世界上所有其他咖啡树出产的都要多。</p>
<p>4．咖啡树是常绿植物，有六至十二英尺高，树干直径有十至十五英寸。咖啡树生长的年份长了，低处的枝条向下弯曲，往地面方向扩展成圆形，看起来像一把雨伞。咖啡树的枝条质地柔软，最大的枝条可以弯曲到距离地面仅有两三英尺的地方。</p>
<p>5．咖啡树的树皮发白，有些粗糙。咖啡树上都要有树叶，树叶间的距离非常小，分布在树枝的两侧。一株咖啡树上，可能同时看见花瓣、青色的果实和成熟的果实。花瓣脱落之后，原来的地方会长出小小的绿色果实，慢慢成熟，变成深红色。</p>
<p>6．它的果实和樱桃没有什么不同，吃起来味道很不错。在“樱桃”果肉下面，就可以看到豆子了，也就是我们所称的咖啡豆，它包裹在一层细薄的外皮之下。咖啡豆最初非常软，味道也不好，但随着“樱桃”的果肉成熟，咖啡豆也越来越硬，最后干瘪的果实成为一个深褐色的豆荚。</p>
<p>7．咖啡豆现在是实心的，颜色接近半透明的绿色。每个果壳里有两粒种子，一边是球状，一边是平直的。两粒种子的平面挨在一起。在一种非常珍贵的品种里，两粒种子慢慢长在一起，形成一粒豆，这被叫作圆豆。咖啡豆的果实成熟后，就能够从树上摇下来。外皮和咖啡豆分离，外皮在阿拉伯被当地人使用，咖啡豆则用来出售。</p>
<p>8．小咖啡树插在一个十二至十八英寸深的洞里，两株之间距离六至八英尺远。如果让它们自由生长，可以长到十八至二十英尺高，但人们经常修剪，把它们修剪得比较矮，这样采种子的时候比较容易。</p>
<p>9．因为顶端优势，它们向外伸展枝条，直到覆盖周围的空间。咖啡树一般第三年开始结果实。到第六年、第七年的时候它们就已经硕果累累，这样的情况会持续二十年，甚至更久。</p>
<p>10．在用咖啡豆之前，先要进行烘烤。烘烤出的芳香油含量的高低和咖啡豆的市场价值有很大关系。人们发现，生咖啡豆存放的时间越久，烤出的这种独特的油越多，价值也就越高。但是，咖啡豆在烘烤之后，尤其在磨碎之后，这种芳香很快会消失。</p>
<p>11．阿拉伯生产著名的摩卡咖啡，也叫穆哈咖啡，这是世界上最好的咖啡。但是，上好的产品很少，甚至没有出口国外。东印度的爪哇咖啡紧随其后，但这种咖啡中质量上乘的也很难获得。因此，很多人更乐意选择南美上等的里约咖啡，而不是选择国内能买到的摩卡或爪哇咖啡。</p>

<p>冬天之王</p>
<p>1．Oh! what will become of thee, poor little bird?</p>
<p>The muttering (1) storm in the distance is heard;</p>
<p>The rough winds are waking, the clouds growing black,</p>
<p>They’ll soon scatter snowflakes all over thy back!</p>
<p>From what sunny clime hast thou wandered away?</p>
<p>And what art thou doing this cold winter day?</p>
<p>2．“I’m picking the gum from the old peach tree;</p>
<p>The storm doesn’t trouble me. Pee, dee, dee!”</p>
<p>3．But what makes thee seem so unconscious (2) of care?</p>
<p>The brown earth is frozen, the branches are bare:</p>
<p>And how canst thou be so light-hearted and free,</p>
<p>As if danger and suffering thou never should’st see,</p>
<p>When no place is near for thy evening nest,</p>
<p>No leaf for thy screen, for thy bosom no rest?</p>
<p>4．“Because the same Hand is a shelter for me,</p>
<p>That took off the summer leaves. Pee, dee, dee!”</p>
<p>5．But man feels a burden of care and of grief,</p>
<p>While plucking the cluster (3) and binding the sheaf:</p>
<p>In the summer we faint, in the winter we’re chilled,</p>
<p>With ever a void that is yet to be filled.</p>
<p>We take from the ocean, the earth, and the air,</p>
<p>Yet all their rich gifts do not silence our care.</p>
<p>6．“A very small portion sufficient will be,</p>
<p>If sweetened with gratitude. Pee, dee, dee!”</p>
<p>7．But soon there’ll be ice weighing down the light bough,</p>
<p>On which thou art flitting (4) so playfully now;</p>
<p>And though there’s a vesture (5) well fitted and warm,</p>
<p>Protecting the rest of thy delicate form,</p>
<p>What, then, wilt thou do with thy little bare feet,</p>
<p>To save them from pain, mid the frost and the sleet?</p>
<p>8．“I can draw them right up in my feathers, you see,</p>
<p>To warm them, and fly away. Pee, dee, dee!”</p>
<p>9．I thank thee, bright monitor (6) ; what thou hast taught</p>
<p>Will oft be the theme of the happiest thought;</p>
<p>We look at the clouds; while the birds have an eye</p>
<p>To Him who reigns over them, changeless and high.</p>
<p>And now little hero, just tell me thy name,</p>
<p>That I may be sure whence my oracle (7) came.</p>

<p>你是从什么样的晴朗天气里来到这里？</p>
<p>在这寒冷的冬日里你又在做什么？</p>

<h2 id="lesson-44-the-nettle">LESSON 44 THE NETTLE</h2>
<p>荨麻</p>
<p>1．Anna. O papa! I have stung my hand with that nettle.</p>
<p>2．Father. Well, my dear, I am sorry for it; but pull up that large
dock leaf you see near it; now bruise the juice out of it on the part
which is stung. Well, is the pain lessened?</p>
<p>3．A. Oh, very much indeed, I hardly feel it now. But I wish there
was not a nettle in the world. I am sure I do not know what use there
can be in them.</p>
<p>4．F. If you knew anything of botany, Nanny, you would not say
so.</p>
<p>5．A. What is botany, papa?</p>
<p>6．F. Botany, my dear, is the knowledge of plants.</p>
<p>7．A. Some plants are very beautiful. If the lily were growing in our
fields, I should not complain. But this ugly nettle! I do not know what
beauty or use there can be in that.</p>
<p>8．F. And yet, Nanny, there is more beauty, use, and instruction in a
nettle, than even in a lily.</p>
<p>9．A. O papa, how can you make that out?</p>
<p>10．F. Put on your gloves, pluck up that nettle, and let us examine
it. First, look at the flower.</p>
<p>11．A. The flower, papa? I see no flower, unless those little ragged
knobs are flowers, which have neither color nor smell, and are not much
larger than the heads of pins.</p>
<p>12．F. Here, take this magnifying glass (1) and examine them.</p>
<p>13．A. Oh, I see now; every little knob is folded up in leaves, like
a rosebud. Perhaps there is a flower inside.</p>
<p>14．F. Try; take this pin and touch the knob. Well, what do you
see?</p>
<p>15．A. Oh, how curious!</p>
<p>16．F. What is curious?</p>
<p>17．A. The moment I touched it, it flew open. A little cloud rose out
like enchantment (2) , and four beautiful little stems sprung up as if
they were alive; and, now that I look again with the glass, I see an
elegant little flower as nice and perfect as a lily itself.</p>
<p>18．F. Well, now examine the leaves.</p>
<p>19．A. Oh, I see they are all covered over with little bristles; and
when I examine them with the glass, I see a little bag, filled with a
juice like water, at the bottom of each. Ha! these are the things which
stung me.</p>
<p>20．F. Now touch the little bag with the point of the pin.</p>
<p>21．A. When I press the bag, the juice runs up and comes out at the
small point at the top; so I suppose the little thorn must be hollow
inside, though it is finer than the point of my cambric needle.</p>
<p>22．F. Have all the leaves those stings?</p>
<p>23．A. No, papa; some of the young ones are quite green and soft,
like velvet, and I may handle them without any danger.</p>
<p>24．F. Now look at the stem, and break it.</p>
<p>25．A. I can easily crack it, but I can not break it asunder (3) ,
for the bark is so strong that it holds it together.</p>
<p>26．F. Well, now you see there are more curious things in the nettle
than you expected.</p>
<p>27．A. Yes, indeed, I see that. But you have often told me that God
makes nothing without its use; and I am sure I can not see any use in
all these things.</p>
<p>28．F. That we will now consider. You saw the little flower burst
open, and a cloud rose, you say, like enchantment. Now all this is
necessary for the nature of the plant. There are many thousand plants in
the world, and it has pleased God, in his wisdom, to make them all
different. Now look at this other nettle, which grew on the opposite
side of the road; you see that it is not exactly like the one you have
just examined.</p>
<p>29．A. No, papa; this has little flat seeds instead of flowers.</p>
<p>30．F. Very right, my dear. Now, in order to make those seeds grow,
it is necessary that the little flower of this plant and the seed of
that should be together, as they are in most others. But plants can not
walk, like animals. The wisdom of God, therefore, has provided a remedy
(4) for this. When the little flower bursts open it throws out a fine
powder, which you saw rise like a cloud; this is conveyed (5) by the air
to the other plant, and when it falls upon the seed of that plant it
gives it power to grow, and makes it a perfect seed, which, in its turn,
when it falls to the ground, will produce a new plant. Were it not for
this fine powder, that seed would never be perfect or complete.</p>
<p>31．A. That is very curious, indeed; and I see the use of the little
cloud and the flower; but the leaf that stung me, of what use can that
be? There, dear papa, I am afraid I puzzle you to tell me that.</p>
<p>32．F. Even these stings are made useful to man. The poor people in
some countries use them instead of blisters, when they are sick. Those
leaves which do not sting are used by some for food, and from the stalk
others get a stringy (6) bark, which answers the purpose of flax. Thus
you see that even the despised nettle is not made in vain; and this
lesson may serve to teach you that we only need to understand the works
of God to see that “in goodness and wisdom he has made them all.”</p>

<p>1．安娜： 哦！爸爸，那棵荨麻蜇到我的手了。</p>
<p>2．父亲：
哦，我的宝贝，真替你难过。把你看见的旁边的大酸模草叶摘下来，挤出叶子上的汁，涂在被蜇到的地方。现在怎么样，好点了吗？</p>
<p>3．安娜：

有些植物很漂亮。如果我们的地里种着百合，我就不会抱怨什么了。可是这难看的荨麻。我真不知道它们有什么好的，有什么用处。</p>
<p>8．父亲： 可是娜娜，荨麻的妙处、用处和门道可比百合多多了。</p>
<p>9．安娜： 哦，爸爸，你为何这样说呢？</p>
<p>10．父亲：
戴上手套，拔下那棵荨麻，我们一起来对它进行观察。先看看荨麻的花。</p>

荨麻的花？我没看到花，除非这些粗糙的小疙瘩是荨麻花，不过它们既没有好看的颜色，也没有花的味道，还没有大头针大。</p>
<p>12．父亲： 给你，用这个放大镜好好看看。</p>
<p>13．安娜：
哇，现在看见了。每个小疙瘩都被叶子包裹着，就像一个玫瑰花苞。也许里面就有花呢。</p>

<p>15．安娜： 哎，真奇怪！</p>
<p>16．父亲： 怎么奇怪了？</p>
<p>17．安娜：
我一碰，它就绽开了。就像施了魔法一般，一小团云雾升了起来，四根小小的根茎弹出来，仿佛它们活起来了。现在我再用放大镜看，看见一个优雅的小花朵，像百合花一样完美漂亮。</p>
<p>18．父亲： 嗯，你现在仔细看看叶子。</p>
<p>19．安娜：
哦，我看见叶子上覆盖着一层细小的硬毛，用放大镜看的话，我能看见一个小包，好像装满了水，就在细毛底部呢。哈，刚才就是这些东西蜇了我。</p>
<p>20．父亲： 那你用大头针的针尖碰一下那些小包。</p>
<p>21．安娜：
当我挤压它时，里面的汁液就挤出来了，从顶部的小孔流出来。所以我猜这些小刺里面肯定是空心的，不过比我的麻纱针的针头还要锋利呢。</p>
<p>22．父亲： 所有的叶子都有这样的刺吗？</p>
<p>23．安娜：
不是的，爸爸，有的嫩叶又绿又软，就像天鹅绒一样，估计我碰这些叶子也不会有事的。</p>
<p>24．父亲： 看看枝干，能不能弄断？</p>
<p>25．安娜：
我很容易就弄折了，可是没办法弄断，外皮太坚韧了，连在一起弄不开。</p>
<p>26．父亲：
看吧，现在是不是发现荨麻有好多奇妙的地方是以前没想到的？</p>
<p>27．安娜：
是的，确实，我发现了。但是，您以前总和我说，上帝造的每一件东西都是有用的，可我看不出这些东西有什么用。</p>
<p>28．父亲：
这就是我们现在要说的。你刚才看见小花瓣绽放，一片云朵升起来，你说就像施了魔法一样。所有这些都是植物自然生长所必需的。世界上有千万种植物，上帝以他的智慧，把这些植物造得各自不同。我们现在看看长在马路对面的另外一种荨麻，你会发现这和你刚才看到的又不一样。</p>
<p>29．安娜：
真的不一样啊，爸爸。这棵荨麻没有花，而是长着扁扁的种子。</p>
<p>30．父亲：
很对，亲爱的，这些种子要生长，这棵荨麻的花朵和那棵荨麻的种子必须结合起来，就像其他植物一样。但是，植物不会像动物一样行走移动。因此，上帝用他的智慧，提供了一种补救的方式。小花朵绽放的时候释放出精细的粉末，也就是你看到像云雾一样的东西，它们随着空气传递到其他植物上，落到那棵荨麻的种子上时，种子就获得了生长的力量，使其成为饱满的种子。种子一旦掉在地上，就会长成一棵新的荨麻。如果没有这样的粉末，那些种子就无法变得饱满和完整。</p>
<p>31．安娜：
这可真奇妙。我现在知道小云团和小花有什么用了。但是，蜇了我的叶子，又有什么用呢？亲爱的爸爸，恐怕这个要难住你了吧。</p>
<p>32．父亲：
那些小刺对人类都是有用的。在一些国家，穷人们生病时不用药，而是用荨麻叶子的刺来治病。那些不带刺的叶子可以当食物，还有人从荨麻枝干得到纤维质的茎皮，用来制作亚麻。你看，即使是最不起眼的荨麻都不是一无是处的。这一课可以告诉我们，我们只需要理解上帝所创造的一切，看“他是如何用善意和智慧创造了一切”。</p>

<p>暴风雨</p>
<p>By James T. Fields (born 1817, died 1881), who was born at
Portsmouth, N. H. He was a poet, and the author, also, of some well
known prose works. Of these, his “Yesterdays with Authors” is the most
noted.</p>
<p>1．We were crowded in the cabin;</p>
<p>Not a soul would dare to sleep:</p>
<p>It was midnight on the waters,</p>
<p>And a storm was on the deep (1) .</p>
<p>2．’T is a fearful thing in winter</p>
<p>To be shattered by the blast (2) ,</p>
<p>And to hear the rattling trumpet</p>
<p>Thunder, “Cut away the mast!”</p>
<p>3．So we shuddered there in silence,</p>
<p>For the stoutest held his breath,</p>
<p>While the hungry sea was roaring,</p>
<p>And the breakers (3) threatened death.</p>
<p>4．And as thus we sat in darkness,</p>
<p>Each one busy in his prayers,</p>
<p>“We are lost!” the captain shouted,</p>
<p>As he staggered down the stairs.</p>
<p>5．But his little daughter whispered,</p>
<p>As she took his icy hand,</p>
<p>“Is n’t God upon the ocean,</p>
<p>Just the same as on the land?”</p>
<p>6．Then we kissed the little maiden,</p>
<p>And we spoke in better cheer (4) ;</p>
<p>And we anchored safe in harbor</p>
<p>When the morn was shining clear.</p>

<p>1．我们挤在船舱里，</p>
<p>没有一个人敢睡去：</p>
<p>那是海上的午夜，</p>

<p>2．在海上被暴风雨打击，</p>

<p>听到吓人的怒吼，</p>
<p>雷声，“切断桅杆！”</p>
<p>3．我们在沉默中瑟瑟发抖，</p>
<p>连最强壮的人也屏住了呼吸，</p>
<p>饥饿的大海咆哮着，</p>
<p>浪花击打岩石发出死亡的威胁。</p>
<p>4．就这样，我们坐在黑暗里，</p>
<p>每个人都忙着祷告，</p>
<p>“我们迷路了！”船长喊道，</p>
<p>从扶梯上跌跌撞撞地跑下来。</p>
<p>5．但他的小女儿拉起他冰冷的手，</p>
<p>对他轻声细语：</p>
<p>“难道上帝不是像在陆地上一样，</p>
<p>也会在海上吗？”</p>

<p>The poetry at the close of this selection is by John Keble, a
celebrated English clergyman, born in 1792. He held for some years the
professorship of Poetry at Oxford University. He died in 1866.</p>
<p>1．Come, and I will show you what is beautiful. It is a rose fully
blown (1) . See how she sits upon her mossy stem, the queen of flowers.
Her leaves glow like fire. The air is filled with her sweet odor (2) .
She is the delight of every eye.</p>
<p>2．But there is one fairer than the rose. He that made the rose is
more beautiful than the rose. He is altogether lovely. He is the delight
of every heart.</p>
<p>3．I will show you what is strong. The lion is strong. When he
raiseth himself up from his lair (3) , when he shaketh his mane, when
the voice of his roaring is heard, the cattle of the field fly, and the
wild beasts of the desert (4) hide themselves; for he is terrible.</p>
<p>4．But He who made the lion is stronger than the lion. He can do all
things. He gave us life, and in a moment can take it away, and no one
can save us from his hand.</p>
<p>5．I will show you what is glorious. The sun is glorious. When he
shineth in the clear sky, when he sitteth on his throne in the heavens,
and looketh abroad over the earth, he is the most glorious and excellent
(5) object the eye can behold.</p>
<p>6．But He who made the sun is more glorious than the sun. The eye
cannot look on his dazzling (6) brightness. He seeth all dark places, by
night as well as by day. The light of his countenance is over all the
world.</p>
<p>7．This great Being is God. He made all things, but He is more
excellent than all that He has made. He is the Creator, they are the
creatures. They may be beautiful, but He is Beauty. They may be strong,
but He is Strength. They may be perfect, but He is Perfection (7) .</p>
<p>8．There is a book, who runs may read,</p>
<p>Which heavenly truth imparts (8) ,</p>
<p>And all the lore (9) its scholars need—</p>
<p>Pure eyes and loving hearts.</p>
<p>9．The works of God, above, below,</p>
<p>Within us, and around,</p>
<p>Are pages in that book, to show</p>
<p>How God himself is found.</p>
<p>10．The glorious sky, embracing all,</p>
<p>Is like the Father’s love;</p>
<p>Wherewith encompassed (10) , great and small</p>
<p>In peace and order move.</p>
<p>11．Thou who hast given me eyes to see</p>
<p>And love this sight so fair,</p>
<p>Give me a heart to find out Thee</p>
<p>And read Thee everywhere.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is described as beautiful? As strong? As glorious?
Who is more beautiful than the rose, stronger than the lion, and more
glorious than the sun? What is the book which we may all read? What
should it teach us?</p>

<p>1．来吧，我来告诉你们美丽是什么。是完全绽放的玫瑰花。看花仙子坐在长着青苔的枝干上，树叶闪耀似火。空气中充满着她香甜的气息。她给每个人带来欢乐。</p>
<p>2．但还有比玫瑰花更美的。创造玫瑰花的造物主比玫瑰花还要美。他是可爱的。他让每一颗心感到欢乐。</p>
<p>3．我来告诉你强壮是什么。狮子很强壮。当狮子从巢穴起身，它晃动着自己的鬃毛，咆哮着让所有人都能听到，田野里的牛群四散奔逃，沙漠里的野兽慌忙躲藏，因为狮子令人害怕。</p>
<p>4．但创造狮子的造物主，他比狮子还强壮。他无所不能。他给了我们生命，也能在转瞬间将它夺走。没有人能从他的手中拯救我们。</p>
<p>5．我来告诉你辉煌是什么。太阳是辉煌的。太阳在晴朗的天空照耀大地，它坐在天空的太阳宝座上，俯瞰大地，能看到我们眼睛中的一切，它是最为辉煌壮丽的。</p>
<p>6．但创造太阳的造物主，他比太阳还辉煌。肉眼都无法直视他耀眼的光芒。他可以看到一切黑暗的地方，无论黑夜白天。他脸上的光辉洒满整个世界。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-47-the-horse">LESSON 47 THE HORSE</h2>
<p>马</p>
<p>1．Uncle Thomas. Well, boys, I am glad to see you again. Since I last
saw you I have made quite a tour, and at some future time will describe
to you what I have seen. I promised at this meeting, however, to tell
you something about animals, and I propose to begin with the horse. But
I know that you like stories better than lecturing, so I will proceed at
once to tell you some which I have gathered for you.</p>
<p>2．Frank. We never feel tired of listening to you, Uncle Thomas. We
know you always have something curious to tell us.</p>
<p>3．Uncle Thomas. Well then, Frank, to begin at once with the
horse.</p>
<p>4．In several parts of the world there are to be found large herds of
wild horses. In South America the immense (1) plains are inhabited (2)
by them, and it is said that ten thousand are sometimes found in a
single herd. These herds are always preceded by a leader, who directs
their motions; and such is the regularity with which they perform their
movements, that it seems as if they could hardly be surpassed by the
best trained cavalry (3) .</p>
<p>5．It is extremely dangerous for travelers to meet a herd of this
description. When they are unaccustomed to the sight of such a mass of
creatures, they can not help feeling greatly alarmed at their rapid and
apparently irresistible approach. The trampling of the animals sounds
like distant thunder; and such is the rapidity and impetuosity (4) of
their advance, that it seems to threaten instant destruction.</p>
<p>6．Sometimes, however, they suddenly stop short, utter a loud and
piercing neigh, and, with a rapid wheel, take an opposite course, and
altogether disappear. On such occasions it requires great care in the
traveler to prevent his horses from breaking loose and escaping with the
wild herd.</p>
<p>7．In those countries where wild horses are so plentiful, the
inhabitants do not take the trouble to raise others, but whenever they
want one they mount upon an animal accustomed to the sport, and gallop
over the plain toward a herd, which is readily found at no great
distance.</p>
<p>8．The rider gradually approaches some stragglers from the main body,
and, having selected the one he wishes, he dexterously (5) throws the
lasso (which is a long rope with a running noose, and is firmly fixed to
his saddle) either over the wild horse’s head or in such a manner as to
entangle his hind legs; and by the sudden checking of his own horse, he
throws the captured animal over on its side.</p>
<p>9．In an instant he jumps off his horse, wraps his cloak round the
head of the captive, forces a bit into his mouth, and straps a saddle on
his back. He then removes the cloak, and the animal starts to his feet.
With equal quickness the hunter leaps into his saddle; and, in spite of
the kicking of the captive, keeps his seat, till, being wearied out with
his efforts, the horse submits to the guidance of his new master, and is
reduced (6) to complete obedience.</p>
<p>10．Frank. But, Uncle Thomas, are all horses originally (7) wild? I
have heard that Arabia is famous for raising horses.</p>
<p>11．Uncle Thomas. Arabia has, for a long time, been noted for the
beauty and speed of its horses. It is not strange, however, that the
Arabian horse should be the most excellent, when we consider the care
and kindness with which it is treated. One of the best stories which I
have ever heard of the love of an Arabian for his steed, is that related
of an Arab, from whom an English officer wished to purchase his
horse.</p>
<p>12．The animal was a bright bay mare, of fine form and great beauty;
and the owner, proud of her appearance and qualities, paraded (8) her
before the Englishman’s tent until she attracted his attention. On being
asked if he would sell her, “What will you give me?” was the reply.
“That depends upon her age. I suppose she is past five?” “Guess again,”
said he. “Four?” “Look at her mouth,” said the Arab, with a smile. On
examination she was found to be about three. This, from her size and
symmetry (9) , greatly increased her value.</p>
<p>13．The gentleman said, “I will give you eighty tomans (10) ,”
(nearly two hundred and fifty dollars). “A little more, if you please,”
said the fellow, somewhat entertained. “Ninety—a hundred.” He shook his
head and smiled. The officer at last came to three hundred tomans,
(nearly one thousand dollars). “Well,” said the Arab, “you need not
tempt me further. You are a rich nobleman, and, I am told, have loads of
silver and gold. Now,” added he, “you want my mare, but you shall not
have her for all you have got.” He put spurs to his horse, and was soon
out of the reach of temptation.</p>
<p>14．The horse can swim, when necessary, as well as most other
animals, although he is not very fond of the water. Some years ago a
vessel was driven upon the rocks, on the coast of the Cape of Good Hope,
and most of the crew fell an immediate sacrifice to the waves. Those who
were left were seen from the shore, clinging to the different pieces of
the wreck. The sea ran so high that no boat could venture off to their
assistance.</p>
<p>15．Meanwhile, a planter had come from his farm to be a spectator of
the shipwreck. His heart was melted at the sight of the unhappy seamen,
and, knowing the bold spirit of his horse and his excellence as a
swimmer, he determined to make a desperate (11) effort for their
deliverance (12) . Having blown a little Brandy into his horse’s
nostrils, he pushed into the midst of the breakers. At first both horse
and rider disappeared, but it was not long before they floated to the
surface, and swam up to the wreck; when, taking two men with him, each
of whom held on by one of his boots, the planter brought them safe to
shore.</p>
<p>16．This was repeated no less than seven times, and he saved fourteen
lives; but on his return the eighth time, being much fatigued, and
meeting a tremendous wave, he lost his balance and sank in a moment. His
horse swam safely to land, but its gallant (13) rider sank, to rise no
more.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Where are wild horses found? How are they taken? For what
purpose are they taken? In what country are the finest horses raised?
Why are the horses so excellent there? Are not animals always made
better by kind treatment? Why would not the Arab sell his horse? Relate
the anecdote of the planter and the shipwrecked seamen.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-287">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．托马斯叔叔：
嘿，孩子们，很高兴又见到你们。上次见到你们之后，我出去旅游了一段时间，以后有机会给你们讲讲我都看到了什么。不过我答应过你们这次要讲讲动物的事，我建议先从马开始讲起。我知道你们喜欢听故事，不喜欢听课，所以我现在就给你们讲讲我收集的关于马的故事。</p>
<p>2．弗兰克：
托马斯叔叔，听您讲课我们永远不觉得烦。我们知道您总有好玩的讲给我们。</p>
<p>3．托马斯叔叔： 那好吧，弗兰克，我们开始讲马的故事了。</p>
<p>4．世界上许多地区可以发现大群的野马。在南美洲一望无际的大草原上就有野马，据说有时一个马群里有上万匹野马。野马群由一匹领头的马带队，引导马群行进的方向，这也是它们迁徙的规律，即使训练有素的骑兵也不能超越他们。</p>
<p>5．对于旅行者来说，遇见这样的马群是极其危险的。由于他们对于这样一大群动物非常不熟悉，他们看到马群如此快速、无法抗拒地奔跑，不禁会感到恐惧。马群的马蹄声听起来就像远处的雷声，那是它们飞快且疾速前进的声音，似乎带来瞬间毁灭的危险。</p>
<p>6．然而，有时候，马群会突然停下来，发出巨大且穿透力极强的嘶叫声，然后迅速向另一个方向行进，瞬间一起消失不见。这种情况下，旅行者要非常小心，避免自己的马挣脱随着野马群一起跑掉。</p>
<p>7．在野马数量很多的国家，当地人不必费力去饲养马。当他们需要一匹马时，会骑上一匹善于奔跑的马，奔向草原寻找马群，不远处就能发现一群野马。</p>
<p>8．骑马的人渐渐接近一些离群的马，选中想要的马匹之后，他会娴熟地抛出一个套索（就是一条长绳子，一端系着活扣，另一端紧紧系在他的马鞍上），套索或是套在野马的头上，或是缠住它的后腿，然后突然停住自己的马，野马就被拽倒在地上。</p>
<p>9．他从自己马背跳下来，用斗篷缠住被捕马匹的头，把一边塞在马嘴里，再在马背上系上马鞍。然后，他把斗篷取下来，这野马就开始走动起来。猎人非常快速地跳上马背，尽管被捕到的马会不停地踢来踢去，他坐在马背上，直到这匹马用尽力气，终于听从新主人的指挥，变得完全顺从。</p>
<p>10．弗兰克：
可是，托马斯叔叔，所有的马最初都是野马吗？我听说阿拉伯人以驯马而闻名。</p>
<p>11．托马斯叔叔：
阿拉伯的确一直以马匹的健美和速度而闻名于世。不过，想想那里的马得到的用心照料，阿拉伯马匹成为最优秀的品种就一点都不奇怪了。我听到的关于阿拉伯人爱马的故事里最好的一个，是一名英国军官想从一个阿拉伯人那里买他的马。</p>
<p>12．那是一匹亮红棕色的母马，体格健硕，非常漂亮。马的主人为她的外表和体格感到非常自豪，骑着它在英国人的帐篷前炫耀，最终吸引了英国人的注意力。英国人问他是否愿意把马卖给他。他回答说：“你会给我什么呢？”“这就要看马的年纪了。我觉得她已经五岁多了。”“再猜。”“四岁？”“看看她的嘴，”阿拉伯人笑着说。仔细看了之后，发现这匹马大约三岁。从她的体型大小和体格匀称程度来看，这样的年纪无疑大大抬高了她的价值。</p>
<p>13．英国人说：“我给你80托曼（大约是250美元）。”“如果可以的话，再加一些。”阿拉伯人很高兴。“90到100。”他只是摇头微笑。英国人最后出价到了300托曼（约合1000美元）。阿拉伯人说：“好吧，不要再用高价来诱惑我了。我听说你是很富有的贵族，有成箱成箱的金银财宝，”他接着说，“你想要我的马，可是你又不愿意用你所有的钱来换它。”他用靴子上的马刺轻踢了下马的腹部，迅速远离了这个充满诱惑的地方。</p>
<p>14．虽然马不太喜欢水，不过在情况需要的时候，马也会像其他动物一样游泳。很多年以前，一艘船撞到好望角海岸的礁石上，大部分船员落水并有被海浪吞噬的危险。从海岸上能够看见没被海浪冲走的船员，他们抓着船只的残骸浮在水上。海浪很高，没有船敢冒险出海营救他们。</p>
<p>15．这时，一个庄稼汉从农场回来，正好看见了船只遇险。看见船员遇难，他心急如焚。他知道他的马非常勇敢，而他自己也善于游泳，于是他决定不顾一切去拯救船员们。他往马的鼻孔里擦了些白兰地酒，然后牵着马儿冲进了海浪里。最开始马和骑手都消失了，但不久就浮到了海面上，朝着船的残骸游过去。他们救起两个船员，让他们一人抓着骑士的一只靴子，就这样把他们安全地救回岸上。</p>
<p>16．这样的过程他们重复了不下七次，救了14条命。他们第八次返回的时候，由于疲惫过度，又遇上一个巨浪，他失去了平衡，顷刻间沉了下去。他的马安全游回了陆地，而这勇敢的主人却沉到了水里，再也没有上来。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-48-emulation-1">LESSON 48 EMULATION (1)</h2>
<p>竞争</p>
<p>1．Frank’s father was speaking to a friend, one day, on the subject
of competition (2) at school. He said that he could answer for it that
envy is not always connected with it.</p>
<p>2．He had been excelled (3) by many, but did not recollect ever
having felt envious of his successful rivals (4) ; “nor did my winning
many a prize from my friend Birch,” said he, “ever lessen his friendship
for me.”</p>
<p>3．In support of the truth of this, a friend who was present related
an anecdote (5) which had fallen under his own notice in a school in his
neighborhood.</p>
<p>4．At this school the sons of several wealthy farmers, and others,
who were poorer, received instruction. Frank listened with great
attention while the gentleman gave the following account of the two
rivals:</p>
<p>5．It happened that the son of a rich farmer and the son of a poor
widow came in competition for the head of their class. They were so
nearly equal that the teacher could scarcely decide between them; some
days one, and some days the other, gained the head of the class. It was
determined by seeing who should be at the head of the class for the
greater number of days in the week.</p>
<p>6．The widow’s son, by the last day’s trial, gained the victory, and
kept his place the following week, till the school was dismissed for the
holidays.</p>
<p>7．When they met again the widow’s son did not appear, and the
farmer’s son, being next to him, might now have been at the head of his
class. Instead of seizing the vacant place, however, he went to the
widow’s house to inquire what could be the cause of her son’s
absence.</p>
<p>8．Poverty was the cause; the poor woman found that she was not able,
with her utmost efforts, to continue to pay for the tuition (6) and
books of her son, and so he, poor fellow! had been compelled to give up
his schooling, and to return to labor for her support.</p>
<p>9．The farmer’s son, out of the allowance of pocket money which his
father gave him, bought all the necessary books and paid for the tuition
of his rival. He also permitted him to be brought back again to the head
of his class, where he continued for some time, at the expense of his
generous rival.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is the subject of this lesson? What do you mean by
emulation? What is envy? What story is told about the two rivals? Is it
right to envy any person?</p>

<p>1．一天，弗兰克的父亲在和一个朋友谈论学校里竞争的话题。他说他敢负责任地说，嫉妒并不总是和竞争联系在一起。</p>
<p>2．很多人都比他优秀，但他对于他的那些成功的竞争对手并不感到嫉妒，他说：“我从我的朋友波奇那里赢过很多次，但丝毫没有减弱我和他的友谊。”</p>
<p>3．为了支持这个观点，在场的一个朋友讲述了一个故事，故事很短，就发生在他家社区的学校里。</p>
<p>4．在这所学校，富有的农场主的儿子和其他穷人的孩子一起接受教育。这位绅士讲这个故事的时候，弗兰克听得很仔细：</p>
<p>5．事情很碰巧，一个富农的儿子和一个穷寡妇的儿子一起竞选班长。他们的成绩不分伯仲，老师都无法决定选哪个。有时其中一个人的成绩是全班最好的，也有时是另外一个人成绩最好。最后决定，他们两人在一周内，谁的成绩好的时间长，就由谁当班长。</p>
<p>6．寡妇的儿子在最后一天赢得了胜利，在接下来的一周里也保持着首位，直到学校放假。</p>
<p>7．开学的时候，寡妇的儿子没来上学。因为富农的儿子成绩仅次于寡妇的儿子，可以成为班上的班长了。不过，他并没有趁机抢占这个空位置，而是到寡妇家询问她儿子没去上学的原因。</p>
<p>8．原因是贫穷。这个可怜的女人发现她尽了最大努力依然没办法继续支付儿子的学费和书本费。可怜的家伙！所以，不得不放弃学业，辍学回家，帮助妈妈干农活。</p>
<p>9．富农的儿子拿出父亲给他的零花钱，给他的对手买了所需的书本，还支付了学费。他还允许他再次回到班里继续当班长。寡妇的儿子继续做回班长的位置，而学费却是他慷慨的对手提供的。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-50-the-right-way">LESSON 50 THE RIGHT WAY</h2>
<p>正确的方法</p>
<p>Adapted from a story by Frank R. Stockton. He was born at
Philadelphia, April 5, 1834, and when quite a young boy used to write
stories for his own pleasure. He was once a designer and engraver on
wood, and afterwards an editor; but he now devotes himself entirely to
writing, not only for young but also for grown people.</p>
<p>1．“O Andy!” said little Jenny Murdock, “I’m so glad you came along
this way. I can’t get over.”</p>
<p>2．“Can’t get over?” said Andrew. “Why what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>3．“The bridge is gone,” said Jenny. “When I came across after
breakfast it was there, and now it’s over on the other side, and how can
I get back home?”</p>
<p>4．“Why, so it is,” said Andrew. “It was all right when I came over a
little while ago, but old Donald pulls it on the other side every
morning after he has driven his cows across, and I don’t think he has
any right to do it. I suppose he thinks the bridge was made for him and
his cows.”</p>
<p>5．“Now I must go down to the big bridge, Andy, and I want you to go
with me. I’m afraid to go through all those dark woods by myself,” said
Jenny.</p>
<p>6．“But I can’t go, Jenny,” said Andrew, “it’s nearly school time
now.”</p>
<p>7．Andrew was a Scotch boy, and a fine fellow. He was next to the
head of his school, and he was as good at play as he was at his
book.</p>
<p>8．Jenny Murdock, his most particular (1) friend, was a little girl
who lived very near Andrew’s home. She had no brothers or sisters, but
Andrew had always been as good as a brother to her; and, therefore, when
she stood by the water’s edge that morning, just ready to burst into
tears, she thought all her troubles over when she saw Andrew coming
along the road.</p>
<p>9．He had always helped her out of her troubles before, and she saw
no reason why he should not do it now. She had crossed the creek in
search of wild flowers, and when she wished to return had found the
bridge removed, as Andrew supposed, by old Donald McKensie, who pastured
his cows on this side of the creek.</p>
<p>10．This stream was not very wide, nor very deep at its edges, but
the center it was four or five feet deep; and in the spring the water
ran very swiftly, so that wading across it, either by cattle or men, was
quite a difficult undertaking. As for Jenny, she could not get across at
all without a bridge, and there was none nearer than the wagon bridge, a
mile and a half below.</p>
<p>11．“You will go with me, Andy, won’t you?” said the little girl.</p>
<p>12．“And be late to school?” said he. “I have not been late yet, you
know, Jenny.”</p>
<p>13．“Perhaps Dominie (2) Black will think you have been sick or had
to mind the cows,” said Jenny.</p>
<p>14．“He won’t think so unless I tell him,” said Andrew, “and you know
I won’t do that.”</p>
<p>15．“If we were to run all the way, would you be too late?” said
Jenny.</p>
<p>16．“If we were to run all the way to the bridge, and I were to run
all the way back, I should not get to school till after copy time. I
expect every minute to hear the school bell ring,” said Andrew.</p>
<p>17．“But what can I do, then?” said poor little Jenny. “I can’t wait
here till school’s out, and I don’t want to go up to the schoolhouse,
for all the boys to laugh at me.”</p>
<p>18．“No,” said Andrew, reflecting (3) very seriously, “I must take
you home some way or other. It won’t do to leave you here, and, no
matter where you might stay, your mother would be very much troubled
about you.”</p>
<p>19．“Yes,” said Jenny, “she would think I was drowned.”</p>
<p>20．Time pressed, and Jenny’s countenance became more and more
overcast (4) , but Andrew could think of no way in which he could take
the little girl home without being late and losing his standing in the
school.</p>
<p>21．It was impossible to get her across the stream at any place
nearer than the “big bridge;” he would not take her that way, and make
up a false story to account (5) for his lateness at school, and he could
not leave her alone or take her with him.</p>
<p>22．What was to be done? While several absurd and impracticable (6)
plans were passing through his brain, the school bell began to ring, and
he must start immediately to reach the schoolhouse in time.</p>
<p>23．And now his anxiety (7) and perplexity became more intense than
ever; and Jenny, looking up into his troubled countenance, began to
cry.</p>
<p>24．Andrew, who had never before failed to be at the school door
before the first tap of the bell, began to despair. Was there nothing to
be done?</p>
<p>25．Yes! a happy thought passed through his mind. How strange that he
should not have thought of it before! He would ask Dominie Black to let
him take Jenny home. What could be more sensible and straightforward
than such a plan?</p>
<p>26．Of course, the good old schoolmaster gave Andrew the desired
permission, and everything ended happily. But the best thing about the
whole affair was the lesson that the young Scotch boy learned that
day.</p>
<p>27．The lesson was this: when we are puzzling our brains with plans
to help ourselves out of trouble, let us always stop a moment in our
planning, and try to think if there is not some simple way out of the
difficulty, which shall be in every respect perfectly right. If we do
this, we shall probably find a way more easy and satisfactory than any
which we can devise (8) .</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Why could not Jenny cross the stream? Whom did she ask to
help her? What can you tell about Andrew? Who was Jenny Murdock? What
did Jenny wish Andrew to do? Why could he not go with her? Would it have
been right for Andrew to have told an untruth even to help Jenny out of
trouble? What did he finally do? What does this lesson teach us to do in
case of trouble?</p>

<p>1．“哦，安迪！”小姑娘珍妮·默多克说，“真高兴你从这边路过，我过不去了。”</p>
<p>2．“过不去了？”安德鲁说，“怎么回事啊？”</p>
<p>3．珍妮说：“桥不见了。早餐后我过来时桥还在呢，现在桥在另外一边了，我怎么回家啊？”</p>
<p>4．“哦，原来是这样，”安德鲁说，“我刚才过来的时候也还是好的。可是老唐纳德每天早上把牛赶过去之后，他就把桥拽到另一边。我觉得他没有权利这么做。估计他觉得这桥就是为他和他们家牛修的。”</p>
<p>5．“我现在必须得去大桥那儿，安德鲁，我想让你和我一起去。我害怕一个人穿过那片黑暗的树林。”珍妮说。</p>
<p>6．安德鲁说：“但是，我不能去，珍妮。马上就要上课。”</p>
<p>7．安德鲁是个苏格兰男孩，一个好学生。他几乎是学校属一属二的尖子生，玩和学习都很好。</p>
<p>8．珍妮·默多克是他最特别的朋友，这个小女孩住在安德鲁家附近。她没有兄弟姐妹，不过安德鲁对她就像哥哥对妹妹一样好。所以，那天早晨她站在河边刚要大哭时，一看见安德鲁从路那边过来，她觉得一切麻烦都会解决的。</p>
<p>9．安德鲁以前总是能帮她解决各种困难，所以她觉得他现在没有理由不帮助她。她刚才到河这边来摘野花，想要回去的时候，发现桥被移走了。安德鲁猜对了，是老唐纳德·麦肯锡移走的，他在河的另一边放牛呢。</p>
<p>10．这条河并不宽，河岸也不深，但河中间有四五英尺深，春天水流非常急，要趟水过河，无论是人还是牛，都是很难的。对于珍妮而言，没有桥她根本就过不去，最近的货运桥在一英里半的下游。</p>
<p>11．小女孩说：“你会和我去的，是吧安德鲁？”</p>
<p>12．男孩说：“和你去，然后迟到吗？珍妮，你知道我从来没有迟到过的。”</p>
<p>13．“也许布莱克老师会认为你生病了，或者在家照顾奶牛呢。”珍妮说。</p>
<p>14．安德鲁说：“除非我亲自跟他说，不然他不会这么想的，你知道我不会这么做的。”</p>
<p>15．“我们一直跑过去的话，你也会迟到吗？”珍妮问。</p>
<p>16．“如果我们一路跑到桥那边，然后我再跑回来，我到学校的时候就已经过了抄写时间了。我希望能听见学校的每一次铃声。”安德鲁说。</p>
<p>17．“那我怎么办啊？”可怜的小珍妮说，“我不能一直在这儿等到学校放学，我也不想到学校去，因为男孩子们都会取笑我的。”</p>
<p>18．安德鲁很认真地想了想说：“不。我必须想办法把你送回家。把你丢在这儿可不行，无论你待在哪儿，你妈妈都会很担心的。”</p>
<p>19．珍妮说：“是啊，她没准会觉得我被淹死了。”</p>
<p>20．时间越来越紧迫，珍妮脸上的表情也越来越忧虑，但安德鲁还是想不出办法，既能让他把珍妮送回家，还不至于上课迟到，让他在学校的声誉扫地。</p>
<p>21．除了“大桥”那里，没有更近的地方可以送她回家；而他又不愿意去那边把她送回家，然后编一个迟到的理由；他也不能把她留在这儿，或者带她去学校。</p>
<p>22．该怎么办呢？正当几个荒唐不切实际的计划从他脑子里闪过的时候，学校的铃声响起来了，他必须立刻尽快到学校。</p>
<p>23．现在他的焦虑和困窘比任何时候都更强烈，珍妮看着他脸上发愁的表情，开始哭了起来。</p>
<p>24．安德鲁从来没有在第一遍铃响的时候还没到学校，这次他开始绝望了。实在没有办法了吗？</p>
<p>25．有了！他突然想起一个两全其美的办法。真奇怪他刚才怎么没想到呢！他可以到学校请求布莱克老师让他把珍妮送回家。还有什么比这更合理且更直接的方法吗？</p>
<p>26．当然，善良的老教师允许了安德鲁这样做，一切得以完美地解决。但是，整件事最好的是这个小男孩学到了一课。</p>
<p>27．这一课就是：当我们绞尽脑汁想办法帮助自己脱离困境的时候，让我们停下片刻，想一想是不是有什么简单、完美的脱离困境的方法。如果我们能够这样做，可能会找到比原先的任何计划都更简单易行、更令人满意的方法。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-51-the-golden-rule">LESSON 51 THE GOLDEN RULE</h2>
<p>黄金法则</p>
<p>1．To act with integrity (1) and good faith was such a habit with
Susan that she had never before thought of examining the Golden Rule:
“All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so
to them.” But the longer she reflected upon it, the stronger was her
conviction (2) that she did not always obey the precept; at length, she
appealed (3) to her mother for its meaning.</p>
<p>2．“It implies,” said her mother, “in the first place, a total
destruction of all selfishness: for a man who loves himself better than
his neighbors, can never do to others as he would have others do to him.
We are bound not only to do, but to feel, toward others as we would have
others feel toward us. Remember, it is much easier to reprove the sin of
others than to overcome temptation (4) when it assails (5)
ourselves.</p>
<p>3．“A man may be perfectly honest and yet very selfish; but the
command implies something more than mere honesty; it requires charity as
well as integrity. The meaning of the command is fully explained in the
parable of the Good Samaritan. The Levite, who passed by the wounded man
without offering him assistance, may have been a man of great honesty;
but he did not do unto the poor stranger as he would have wished others
to do unto him.”</p>
<p>4．Susan pondered carefully and seriously on what her mother had
said. When she thought over her past conduct, a blush of shame crept to
her cheeks, and a look of sorrow into her eyes, as many little acts of
selfishness and unkindness came back to her memory. She resolved that
for the future, both in great things and small, she would remember and
follow the Golden Rule.</p>
<p>5．It was not long after this that an opportunity occurred of trying
Susan’s principles. One Saturday evening when she went, as usual, to
farmer Thompson’s inn, to receive the price of her mother’s washing for
the boarders, which amounted to five dollars, she found the farmer in
the stable yard.</p>
<p>6．He was apparently in a terrible rage with some horse dealers with
whom he had been bargaining. He held in his hand an open pocketbook,
full of bills; and scarcely noticing the child as she made her request,
except to swear at her, as usual, for troubling him when he was busy, he
handed her a bank note.</p>
<p>7．Glad to escape so easily, Susan hurried out of the gate, and then,
pausing to pin the money safely in the folds of her shawl, she
discovered that he had given her two bills instead of one. She looked
around; nobody was near to share her discovery; and her first impulse
was joy at the unexpected prize.</p>
<p>8．“It is mine, all mine,” said she to herself; “I will buy mother a
new cloak with it, and she can give her old one to sister Mary, and then
Mary can go to the Sunday school with me next winter. I wonder if it
will not buy a pair of shoes for brother Tom, too.”</p>
<p>9．At that moment she remembered that he must have given it to her by
mistake; and therefore she had no right to it. But again the voice of
the tempter whispered, “He gave it, and how do you know that he did not
intend to make you a present of it? Keep it; he will never know it, even
if it should be a mistake; for he had too many such bills in that great
pocketbook to miss one.”</p>
<p>10．While this conflict (6) was going on in her mind between good and
evil, she was hurrying homeward as fast as possible. Yet, before she
came in sight of her home, she had repeatedly balanced (7) the comforts
which the money would buy against the sin of wronging her neighbor.</p>
<p>11．As she crossed the little bridge over the narrow creek before her
mother’s door, her eye fell upon a rustic seat which they had occupied
during the conversation I have before narrated. Instantly the words of
Scripture, “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so
to them,” sounded in her ears like a trumpet.</p>
<p>12．Turning suddenly round, as if flying from some unseen peril, the
child hastened along the road with breathless speed until she found
herself once more at farmer Thompson’s gate. “What do you want now?”
asked the gruff (8) old fellow, as he saw her again at his side.</p>
<p>13．“Sir, you paid me two bills, instead of one,” said she, trembling
in every limb. “Two bills? did I? let me see; well, so I did; but did
you just find it out? Why did you not bring it back sooner?” Susan
blushed and hung her head.</p>
<p>14．“You wanted to keep it, I suppose,” said he. “Well, I am glad
your mother was more honest than you, or I should have been five dollars
poorer and none the wiser.” “My mother knows nothing about it, sir,”
said Susan; “I brought it back before I went home.”</p>
<p>15．The old man looked at the child, and, as he saw the tears rolling
down her cheeks, he seemed touched by her distress. Putting his band in
his pocket, he drew out a shilling and offered it to her.</p>
<p>16．“No, sir, I thank you,” sobbed she; “I do not want to be paid for
doing right; I only wish you would not think me dishonest, for, indeed,
it was a sore temptation. Oh! sir, if you had ever seen those you love
best wanting the common comforts of life, you would know how hard it is
for us always to do unto others as we would have others do unto us.”</p>
<p>17．The heart of the selfish man was touched. “There be things which
are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise,” murmured (9)
he, as he bade the little girl good night, and entered his house a
sadder, and, it is to be hoped, a better man. Susan returned to her
humble home with a lightened (10) heart, and through the course of a
long and useful life she never forgot her first temptation.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is the Golden Rule? What does it imply? Can a man be
perfectly honest and still not follow the Golden Rule? What parable is a
perfect illustration of its meaning? How was Susan tempted? What did she
first think of doing? What changed her intention? Relate what happened
when she returned the money. What effect did her action have?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-291">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．苏珊已经习惯于诚实、善良地对待一切，所以她从来没有想过这条黄金法则：“无论什么事，你想要他人如何对待你，你就要如何对待他人。”但是，她越是长时间地思考这句话，越觉得她没有遵从这个法则，最后，她询问她的母亲这句话是什么意思。</p>
<p>2．她母亲说：“这句话的意思是，首先，彻底摧毁一切自私的心理：如果一个人爱自己胜过爱自己的邻居，就不会像自己希望别人对待他一样来对待别人。我们一定不只是去帮忙别人，还要去体会别人的感受，因为别人也会体会我们的感受。记住，人们总是更容易责难别人的错，更难抵挡自己所面临的诱惑。”</p>
<p>3．“一个人可能既是完全诚实的，同时又是非常自私的，这条法则需要比单纯诚实更深层次的东西，需要仁慈之心和为人正直。这个法则的意思在《好撒玛利亚人》的寓言里得到了很好的解释。利未人路过那个受伤的人而没有提供帮助，利未人可能是很诚实的一个人，但他没有做到对这个可怜的陌生人像他期望别人对待他一样。”</p>
<p>4．苏珊认真严肃地思考着妈妈刚才说的话。当她想到自己过去的一些行为时，不禁有点羞愧得脸红了，眼里满是懊悔的神情，因为她回忆起自己做过的很多自私刻薄的事。她下定决心，今后无论是大事还是小事，都会谨记并遵从这条黄金法则。</p>
<p>5．这件事过去没多久，一个考验苏珊的机会来了。一个周六的傍晚，她像往常一样去汤姆森农场主的旅店，去收取她母亲为店客们洗衣服应得的报酬，总额是5美元。她在马棚里看到了汤姆森。</p>
<p>6．农场主看起来非常愤怒，他正和几个马贩子讨价还价呢。他手里拿着一个敞开的钱包，钱包里满满都是钱。他几乎都没注意苏珊跟他说的话，只是像以前一样骂她几句，嫌她在他忙碌的时候打扰他，然后随手给了苏珊一张纸币。</p>
<p>7．苏珊很高兴能很快拿到钱，急忙出了门。随后，她停下脚步，准备将钱牢牢地别在围巾的夹层里。这时，她发现农场主给了她两张纸币，而不是一张。她环顾四周，没人发现她的秘密，她的第一反应是为意外之财感到高兴。</p>
<p>8．她对自己说：“这是我的了，都是我的。我要用这钱给妈妈买个新斗篷，这样她可以把旧的送给妹妹玛丽，玛丽明年冬天就能和我一起去上主日学了。不知道还够不够给弟弟汤姆买一双鞋。”</p>
<p>9．这时候，她意识到农场主可能不小心弄错了，所以她没权力留下。但是，诱惑的声音再次对她低语：“是他给你的，你怎么知道他不是打算给你一份礼物呢？留着吧，即使是他弄错了，他永远也不会知道这件事的，因为他的钱包里有那么多钱，丢一张也不会发现的。”</p>
<p>10．在她脑子里，善与恶在不停地争斗，她还在快速地朝家的方向跑。但是，在她快要看到自家房子之前，她不断平衡着金钱能够给她带来的慰藉和自己对邻居的罪恶感。</p>
<p>11．她家门前有条窄窄的小河，河上有座小桥，经过小桥的时候，她看到了上次和母亲谈话时坐着的旧椅子。突然之间，一个声音在她耳朵里像喇叭一样响亮地说：“无论什么事，你希望他人怎么对你，你就要怎样对待他人。”</p>
<p>12．这孩子突然转过身来，就像逃离看不见的险境一样快，她上气不接下气地跑了回去，直到她发现自己又来到汤姆森家门前。看见她又回来了，坏脾气的汤姆森说：“你又来干什么？”</p>
<p>13．“先生，您给了我两张钞票，而不是一张，”苏珊浑身颤抖着说。“两张钞票？是这样吗？让我看看。哦，还真是。不过你刚发现吗？为什么不早点送回来？”苏珊脸红了，头也低了下来。</p>
<p>14．“我猜你本想自己留下的吧。”农场主说：“不过，我很高兴你的母亲比你诚实多了，不然我就少了5美元，我也算不得精明了。”“我母亲什么也不知道，先生，”苏珊说，“我还没到家就把钱送回来了。”</p>
<p>15．老人看了看这个孩子，他看见眼泪顺着她的脸颊流了下来，似乎被她的不幸打动了。他把手伸进口袋里，拿出1先令要给她。</p>
<p>16．“不用，先生，谢谢您，”她啜泣着说，“我不想因为做了正确的选择就接受您的钱。我只是希望您不要觉得我不诚实，因为，这毕竟是一个让人心动的诱惑。哦，先生，如果您看着您挚爱的人想要得到最平常的舒适生活，您会知道对于我们来说，对待他人，就像我们希望如何被对待一样，这是多么难的事。”</p>
<p>17．这个自私的男人被打动了。他喃喃地说：“一些在世界上微不足道的事情，已经远远超出了精明的范畴。”他对小女孩说了晚安，难过地进了自己的房子，希望他以后会成为更善良的人。苏珊心情轻松地回到自己简陋的家。在人生漫长而有意义的过程中，她从来没有忘记自己面临的第一次诱惑。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-53-robinson-crusoes-house">LESSON 53 ROBINSON CRUSOE’S
HOUSE</h2>
<p>鲁滨逊·克鲁索的住所</p>
<p>Daniel DeFoe, the author of “Robinson Crusoe” (from which these
selections are adapted), was born in London, England, in 1661, and died
in 1731. He wrote a number of books; but his “Robinson Crusoe” is the
only one that attained great notoriety.</p>
<p>1．I have already described my habitation (1) , which was a tent
under the side of a rock, surrounded with a strong pale (2) of posts and
cables (3) , but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind
of wall up against it of turf (4) , about two feet thick on the outside;
and, after some time (I think it was a year and a half) I raised rafters
from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of
trees and such things as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found
at some times of the year very violent.</p>
<p>2．I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale,
and into the cave which I had made behind me; but I must observe, too,
that at first this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in
no order, took up all my place, so that I had no room to turn myself. So
I set to work to enlarge my cave and work farther into the earth; for it
was a loose, sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labor I bestowed
upon it.</p>
<p>3．And so when I found that I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I
worked sideways into the rock; and then, turning to the right again,
worked quite out, and made me a door to come out on the outside of my
pale or fortification (5) . This gave me not only egress (6) and regress
(7) , as it was a back way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me
room to stow (8) my goods.</p>
<p>4．And now I began to apply (9) myself to make such necessary things
as I found I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without
these I was not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world. I
could not write or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure
without a table.</p>
<p>5．So I went to work. I had never handled a tool in my life; and yet
in time by labor, application, and contrivance, I found that I wanted
nothing but I could have made it, especially if I had had tools;
however, I made abundance of things, even without tools, and some with
no more tools than an adz and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made
that way before, and that with infinite labor.</p>
<p>6．For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut
down a tree, set it before me, and hew it flat on either side with my ax
till I had brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub (10) it
smooth with my adz.</p>
<p>7．It is true, by this method I could make but one board out of a
whole tree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I
had for the prodigious (11) deal (12) of time and labor which it took me
to make a plank or board; but my time or labor was little worth, and so
it was as well employed one way as another.</p>
<p>8．However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above; and
this I did out of the short pieces of boards which I brought on my raft
from the ship; but when I had wrought out some boards, as above, I made
large shelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another,
all along one side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and ironwork
on, and, in a word, to separate everything at large in their places,
that I might come easily at them.</p>
<p>9．I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all
things that would hang up. So that, had my cave been seen, it would have
looked like a general magazine (13) of all necessary things; and I had
everything so ready at my hand that it was a great pleasure to me to see
all my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of all
necessaries so great.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—How did Robinson Crusoe make a house? Of what did he make
a chair and table? How did he obtain boards? What does this lesson teach
us in regard to perseverance?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-293">中文阅读</h4>
<p>本文节选自《鲁滨逊漂流记》，作者丹尼尔·笛福，1661年出生在英国伦敦，1731年去世。他写了很多本书，但《鲁滨逊漂流记》最为著名。</p>
<p>1．我前面已描述过自己的住所。那是一个搭在山岩下的帐篷，四周用木桩和缆索做成坚固的木栅环绕着。现在，我可以把木栅叫作围墙，因为我在木栅外面用草皮堆成了一道两英尺厚的墙，过了一段时间（我估计大约一年半左右
），我在围墙和岩壁之间搭了一些屋椽，上面盖些树枝或其他可以弄到的东西用来挡雨。我发现，一年之中总有一段时间雨水强烈。</p>
<p>2．前面我也说过，我把一切东西都搬进了这个围墙，搬进了在后面的山洞。现在我必须补充说一下，起初那些东西都杂乱无章地堆在那里，占了我所有的空间，弄得我连转身的余地都没有。于是，我开始扩大并挖深山洞。好在岩石的质地是一种很松的沙石，我挖起来很容易。</p>
<p>3．当我觉得围墙已经加固到能够抵御猛兽的袭击之后，我向岩壁旁边挖去，然后再向右挖，一直挖到外面。很快弄好了，这样我可以从另一扇门通到围墙或者避难所外面。这不仅仅是提供了一个可以出入的通道，还是我帐篷和储藏室的后门，而且让我有更多的空间来储藏我的东西。</p>
<p>4．现在，我开始着手制造日常生活的一些必需物品，尤其是椅子和桌子，没有这两样家具，我连世上最起码的生活乐趣都无法享受。没有桌子，我没法写字、吃饭，也没法做其他有意思的事情。</p>
<p>5．于是，我接着开工。我以前从没使用过工具，不过在这段劳动、运用与设计的时间中，我发现我不缺什么，并且我都可以做出来，尤其是如果我有工具的话。然而，即便没有工具，我也制造了很多东西，有时只用锛子和斧头就能做出来，我想之前从来没有人用我这种方法来做，也从来没有花这么大力气的。</p>
<p>6．譬如说，为了要块木板，我只能先砍倒一棵树，把树横放在我面前，再用斧头把两面削平，直到削得像板子一样薄，然后再用锛子刮光。</p>
<p>7．确实，用这种方法，一整棵树只能做一块木板，但这是没有办法的办法，我唯有用耐心才能完成，做一块木板需要花费大量的时间和体力；反正我的时间和体力都已不值钱了，怎么用都无所谓。</p>
<p>8．上面讲了，我给自己做了一张桌子和一把椅子，这些是用我离开大船时乘坐的木筏上拆下来的木板为材料制成的；后来，我用上面提到的办法做了一些木板，我开始制作大木架子，沿着山洞的岩壁，我搭起了足足有一英尺半宽的多层木架。我把工具，钉子和铁器等东西分门别类地放在上面，以便取用。</p>
<p>9．我还把木棒钉进岩石墙，用来挂枪和其他可以挂的东西。假如有人看到我的山洞，会觉得很像仓库，一切东西应有尽有。我把所有物品放得井然有序，取用方便，看见我的东西放得这样整齐，尤其发现各种物品一应俱全，我特别享受。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-54-robinson-crusoes-dress">LESSON 54 ROBINSON CRUSOE’S
DRESS</h2>
<p>鲁滨逊的衣服</p>
<p>1．But had any man in England met such a man as I was, it must either
have frightened him or raised a great deal of laughter; and, as I
frequently stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the
notion of my traveling through Yorkshire in such a dress.</p>
<p>2．I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat’s skin, with a
flap hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot
the rain off from running into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in
these climates as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.</p>
<p>3．I had a short jacket of goatskin, the skirts coming down to about
the middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same;
the breeches were made of the skin of an old goat, and the hair hung
down such a length on either side that it reached to the middle of my
legs like pantaloons.</p>
<p>4．Stockings and shoes I had none; but I made a pair of something, I
scarce know what to call them, like buskins (1) , to flap over my legs,
and lace on either side like spatterdashes (2) ; but they were of a most
barbarous (3) shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.</p>
<p>5．I had on a broad belt of goatskin dried, which I drew together
with two thongs (4) of the same, instead of buckles; and, in a kind of
frog (5) on each side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a
little saw and hatchet; one on one side, and one on the other. I had
another belt not so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung
over my shoulder; and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two
pouches (6) , both made of goatskin, too; in one of which hung my
powder, in the other my shot.</p>
<p>6．At my back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over my
head a great, clumsy, ugly, goatskin umbrella, but which, after all, was
the most necessary thing I had about me, next to my gun.</p>
<p>7．As for my face, the color of it was really not so dark as one
might expect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within nine
or ten degrees of the equator. My beard I had once suffered to grow till
it was about a quarter of a yard long; but, as I had both scissors and
razors sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my
upper lip, which I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers,
such as I had seen worn by some Turks.</p>
<p>8．Of these mustaches or whiskers, I will not say that they were long
enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape
monstrous (7) enough, and such as in England would have passed for
frightful. But all this is by the bye; for, as to my figure, I had so
few to observe me that it was of no manner of consequence; so I say no
more on that part.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-294">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．如果在英国有人碰到我，肯定要么吓一跳，要么大笑一番。我也常常停下来打量自己，想到自己如果穿这套行装，像这样打扮在约克郡穿行，我也禁不住笑了起来。</p>
<p>2．我头上戴着一顶山羊皮做的帽子，这帽子做得又高又大，没什么样子，后面还垂着一个帽檐。这帽子一来是为了遮阳，二来是为了挡雨，免得雨水流进脖子。在热带这样的气候，大雨淋透衣服沾到皮肤是最伤身体的。</p>
<p>3．我上身穿着一件山羊皮做的外套，衣襟遮住了一半大腿。下身穿了一条齐膝短裤，也是用一只老公羊的皮做成的，两旁的羊毛一直垂到小腿上，看上去像条马裤。</p>
<p>4．我没有鞋子，也没有袜子，但我做了一双类似的，不过我不知道该称它什么，有点像半高筒靴，挂在小腿上，两边再用绳子系起来，就像绑腿一样。不过这鞋做的样子很原始，其实我身上穿的其他衣服也一样原始。</p>
<p>5．我腰间系了一条很宽的皮带，那是用两片一样的小羊皮晒干做成的，皮带没有搭扣，两头各有一个搭环，搭环上没挂短刀或者短剑，而挂了一把小锯和一把斧头，一边一把。我还有另一条窄一点的皮带，用同样的方式系着，斜跨在我的肩膀上。在皮带头上，我的左胳膊下面，挂着两个袋子，也都是山羊皮的，一个装火药，一个装子弹。</p>
<p>6．我身后背着筐子，肩上扛着枪，头上撑着一顶羊皮做的太阳伞，样子又难看又笨拙。尽管如此，除了枪之外，这把雨伞是我最不可缺少的东西。</p>
<p>7．至于我的脸，对于像我这样不修边幅，且生活在距离赤道九或十度以内的热带地区的人，还不算黑。我的胡子曾长到四分之一码长，但我有剪刀和剃刀，所以就把它剪短了，但上嘴唇的胡子仍留着，并修剪成像伊斯兰教徒式的八字胡，像我见到的土耳其人留的胡子那样。</p>
<p>8．不敢说我的胡子长得足以悬挂我的帽子，但确实长度和形状非常古怪，要是在英国被看见，准会把人吓一大跳。不过所有这些都无关紧要，因为我什么样子，根本没有人会看到，所以什么样都无关紧要，我就不多说了。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-56-knowledge-is-power">LESSON 56 KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</h2>
<p>知识就是力量</p>
<p>1．“What an excellent thing is knowledge,” said a sharp-looking,
hustling little man, to one who was much older than himself. “Knowledge
is an excellent thing,” repeated he. “My boys know more at six and seven
years old than I did at twelve. They can read all sorts of books, and
talk on all sorts of subjects (1) . The world is a great deal wiser than
it used to he. Everybody knows something of everything now. Do you not
think, sir, that knowledge is all excellent thing?”</p>
<p>2．“Why, sir,” replied the old man, looking grave, “that depends
entirely upon the use to which it is applied. It may be a blessing or a
curse. Knowledge is only an increase of power, and power may be a bad,
as well as a good thing.” “That is what I can not understand,” said the
bustling (2) little man. “How can power he a bad thing?”</p>
<p>3．“I will tell you,” meekly (3) replied the old man; and thus he
went on: “When the power of a horse is under restraint (4) , the animal
is useful in bearing burdens (5) , drawing loads, and carrying his
master; but when that power is unrestrained, the horse breaks his
bridle, dashes to pieces the carriage that he draws, or throws his
rider.” “I see!” said the little man.</p>
<p>4．“When the water of a large pond is properly conducted (6) by
trenches (7) , it renders the fields around fertile (8) ; but when it
bursts through its banks, it sweeps everything before it and destroys
the produce (9) of the fields.” “I see!” said the little man, “I
see!”</p>
<p>5．“When the ship is steered (10) aright, the sail that she hoists
(11) enables her sooner to get into port; but if steered wrong, the more
sail she carries the further will she go out of her course.” “I see!”
said the little man, “I see clearly!”</p>
<p>6．“Well, then,” continued the old man, “if you see these things so
clearly, I hope you can see, too, that knowledge, to be a good thing,
must be rightly applied (12) . God’s grace in the heart will render the
knowledge of the head a blessing; but without this, it may prove to us
no better than a curse.” “I see! I see!” said the little man, “I
see!”</p>
<p>EXERCISES—What is the subject of this lesson? Is knowledge always a
power? Is it always blessing? Relate the several examples of power
wrongly used. If we use the powers that God has given us for bad
purposes, what will our knowledge prove to be?</p>

<p>1．“知识是多么奇妙啊！”一个长相瘦削、非常精神的小个子男人对一位长者说。他重复着：“知识是多么奇妙啊！六七岁的孩子们比我十二岁的时候知道得多。他们能读各种各样的书，谈论各种各样的话题。现在的世界比以前更充满智慧。每个人对所有事都有所了解。您难道不觉得吗，先生？知识真是非常奇妙啊！”</p>
<p>2．这位老者看起来很严肃，他回答说：“先生，为什么呢？那完全取决于知识用在什么地方。知识可能是好事，也可能是祸根。知识仅仅能够让力量加强，而这力量可能是好事，同样可能是坏事。”这个很精神的小个子男人说：“这我就不明白了，力量怎么能是坏事呢？”</p>
<p>3．“让我来告诉你吧，”老人温和地回答，他接着说，“如果一匹马的力量能够很好地控制，这匹马可以驮重物，可以运行李，还可以驮它的主人。但是，如果它的力量不受限制，马会挣脱缰绳，飞奔的时候把马车拖碎，甚至把骑马的人甩下来。”“我明白了！”小个子男人说道。</p>
<p>4．“池塘里的水，如果用沟渠进行适当的引导，可以灌溉周围的田地，让土壤肥沃。但是，一旦冲毁堤坝，水就会冲走一切，摧毁地里的收成。”“我明白了！”小个子说，“我明白了！”</p>
<p>5．“如果轮船驾驶的方向正确，升起的帆会让船早日驶回港口。但是，如果驾驶的方向不对，帆越多，船偏离得就越远。”“我明白了！”小个子说，“我明白了！”</p>
<p>6．老人继续说：“好吧，那么，如果你清楚地明白这些事，我希望你也能明白，只有被正确地运用，知识才能是好事。心中带着对上帝的感恩，这会让我们的知识变成祝福，但如果没有做到，知识可能就会成为祸根。”“我明白了！”小个子说，“我明白了！”</p>

<p>善意</p>
<p>1．I suppose you all, my boys, are looking for some sort of success
in life; it is right that you should; but what are your notions of
success? To get rich as soon as possible, without regard to the means by
which your wealth is acquired?</p>
<p>2．There is no true success in that: when you have gained millions,
you may yet be poorer than when you had nothing; and it is that same
reckless ambition which has brought many a bright and capable boy, not
to great estate at last, but to miserable failure and disgrace; not to a
palace, but to a prison.</p>
<p>3．Wealth rightly got and rightly used, rational enjoyment, power,
fame,—these are all worthy objects of ambition; but they are not the
highest objects, and you may acquire them all without achieving true
success. But if, whatever you seek, you put good will into all your
actions, you are sure of the best success at last; for whatever else you
gain or miss, you are building up a noble and beautiful character (1) ,
which is not only the best of possessions in this world, but also is
about all you can expect to take with you into the next.</p>
<p>4．I say, good will in all your actions. You are not simply to be
kind and helpful to others; but, whatever you do, give honest, earnest
purpose (2) to it. Thomas is put by his parents to learn a business. But
Thomas does not like to apply himself very closely. “What’s the use?” he
says. “I’m not paid much, and I’m not going to work much. I’ll get along
just as easily as I can, and have as good times as I can.”</p>
<p>5．So he shirks his tasks; and instead of thinking about his
employer’s interests, or his own self improvement, gives his mind to
trifles,—often to evil things, which in their ruinous effects upon his
life are not trifles. As soon as he is free from his daily duties, he is
off with his companions, having what they call a good time; his heart is
with them even while his hands are employed in the shop or store.</p>
<p>6．He does nothing thoroughly well,—not at all for want of talent,
but solely for lack of good will. He is not preparing himself to be one
of those efficient clerks or workmen who are always in demand, and who
receive the highest wages.</p>
<p>7．There is a class of people who are the pest of every community,
workmen who do not know their trade, men of business ignorant of the
first principles (3) of business. They can never be relied upon to do
well anything they undertake. They are always making blunders which
other people have to suffer for, and which react upon themselves. They
are always getting out of employment, and failing in business.</p>
<p>8．To make up for what they lack in knowledge and thoroughness, they
often resort to trick and fraud, and become not merely contemptible but
criminal. Thomas is preparing himself to be one of this class. You can
not, boys, expect to raise a good crop from evil seed.</p>
<p>9．By Thomas’s side works another boy, whom we will call James,—a lad
of only ordinary capacity (4) , very likely. If Thomas and all the other
boys did their best, there would be but small chance for James ever to
become eminent. But he has something better than talent: he brings good
will to his work. Whatever he learns, he learns so well that it becomes
a part of himself.</p>
<p>10．His employers find that they can depend upon Jim. Customers soon
learn to like and trust him. By diligence, self-culture, good habits,
cheerful and kindly conduct, he is laying the foundation of a generous
manhood and a genuine success.</p>
<p>11．In short, boys, by slighting your tasks you hurt yourself more
than you wrong your employer. By honest service you benefit yourself
more than you help him. If you were aiming at mere worldly advancement
only, I should still say that good will was the very best investment you
could make in business.</p>
<p>12．By cheating a customer, you gain only a temporary and unreal
advantage. By serving him with right good will,—doing by him as you
would be done by,—you not only secure his confidence but also his good
will in return. But this is a sordid (5) consideration compared with the
inward satisfaction, the glow and expansion of soul which attend a good
action done for itself alone. If I were to sum up all I have to say to
you in one last word of love and counsel, that one word should be—Good
will.</p>
<p>(J. T. Trowbridge )</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is meant by the phrase “to apply himself,” in the
fourth paragraph? What is meant by “a generous manhood,” tenth
paragraph? By “expansion of soul,” twelfth paragraph? Tell what is meant
by “good will,” as taught by this lesson. How did Tom and James differ
in character?</p>

<p>1．我的孩子们，我想你们的一生都在追寻某种成功，这样当然是对的，但你对于成功的定义是什么呢？是要变得尽可能地富有，毫不顾忌获得财富的途径吗？</p>
<p>2．这不是真正的成功：当你获得了百万的财富，你可能比一无所有的时候还要贫穷。也正是同样不计后果的野心，最后常常不会给聪明能干的孩子巨额的财产，而是惨痛的失败和屈辱，狼狈不堪；等待他们的不是宫殿，而是监狱。</p>
<p>3．正当地获得财富、恰当地使用财富、理性地享受、权力、名气——这些都是值得雄心壮志的人追求的目标。但这些不是最高目标，即便你获得了这一切，仍然没有获得真正的成功。可是，无论你追求什么，你都带着善意去做事，最终你肯定是最好的成功者，这其中不论你得到或失去什么，你都在塑造一个高贵、完美的个人形象。这不但是世界上最好的品质，还是你最终能够带到下一世的所有财富。</p>
<p>4．我想说，你的每个行为都要用心。不是简单的待人和蔼、乐于助人，而是要永远带着诚实和真诚的心去做每一件事。托马斯的父母让他学习做生意，可托马斯并没有全力以赴地去学。他说：“有什么用呢？我的工资又不高，所以我不会努力工作的。我得过且过，能混日子过得轻松愉快就行了。”</p>
<p>5．所以，他常常逃避责任，从不考虑雇主的利益，或者提高自己的能力，他只考虑一些微不足道的——这些事常常是有害的，而这些事对他的人生具有毁灭性的后果，这可不是微不足道的了。一做完日常的工作，他马上和伙伴们出去玩，去享受他们所谓的欢乐时光。即使手上做着商店或仓库的工作，他的心也飞到伙伴们那里了。</p>
<p>6．他从来没有尽全力做过一件事——并不是因为他缺乏才能，而是因为他没有善意。他从没想过要成为一名最杰出的职员或工人，这种人最紧缺，工资也最高。</p>
<p>7．有这样一类人，他们是人群中的害虫。工人不懂业务，商人忽略商业的第一法则。你永远不能指望他们做好任何工作。他们总是不断出错，给别人添麻烦，反过来也影响他们自己。他们总是被开除，经商总会失败。</p>
<p>8．因为缺乏知识，考虑不周，他们经常使用小把戏、小技巧。不仅可憎，还可能走向犯罪。托马斯正让他自己成为他们中的一员。孩子们，如果种子是坏的，不能期望长出好庄稼。</p>
<p>9．在托马斯的旁边另一个男孩在工作，我们叫他詹姆斯，他很可能才能一般。如果托马斯和其他男孩们全力以赴，詹姆斯变得杰出的机会就微乎其微。但是，他有比才智更宝贵的品格：他做每件事都很用心。不管他学什么，他都学得很好，并且与所学的知识融为一体。</p>
<p>10．他的老板发现能够依赖詹姆斯。客户们很快开始喜欢他、信赖他。通过勤奋努力、自我学习、良好习惯、积极友善的举动，詹姆斯为自己具有慷慨的人格和真正的成功打下了基础。</p>
<p>11．孩子们，总而言之，怠慢你的工作，不仅对雇主不公，更会伤害你自己。通过诚实服务，不仅老板受益，你更在帮助自己。如果你所追求的仅仅是物质上的成就，我还是告诉你，善意是你对事业唯一最好的投资。</p>
<p>12．欺骗客户，你得到的只是暂时的利益，这是不真实的。用心好好地对待客户——就像你期望被别人对待的那样——你不但可以赢得客户的信任，而且还能得到客户善意的回报。但是，与内心的满足、心灵的喜悦和充实相比，这是微不足道的，每个真正用心的善行从来别无他求。如果要用一个词来总结我刚才对你说的一切，这个词就是——善意。</p>

<p>中国故事一则</p>
<p>By Christopher Pearse Cranch, who was born at Alexandria, Va. (then
D. C.), in 1813．He has written some well-known children’s stories,
besides numerous poems; but his greatest literary work is “The AEneid of
Vergil, translated into English blank verse.” He died in Cambridge
Mass., 1892.</p>
<p>1．Two young, near-sighted (1) fellows, Chang and Ching,</p>
<p>Over their chopsticks (2) idly chattering,</p>
<p>Fell to disputing which could see the best;</p>
<p>At last, they agreed to put it to the test.</p>
<p>Said Chang, “A marble tablet (3) , so I hear,</p>
<p>Is placed upon the Bo-hee temple near,</p>
<p>With an inscription (4) on it. Let us go</p>
<p>And read it (since you boast your optics (5) so),</p>
<p>Standing together at a certain place</p>
<p>In front, where we the letters just may trace;</p>
<p>Then he who quickest reads the inscription there,</p>
<p>The palm (6) for keenest eyes henceforth shall bear.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” said Ching, “but let us try it soon:</p>
<p>Suppose we say to-morrow afternoon.”</p>
<p>2．“Nay, not so soon,” said Chang; “I’m bound to go</p>
<p>To-morrow a day’s ride from Hoang-Ho,</p>
<p>And sha’n’t be ready till the following day:</p>
<p>At ten A. M (7) ., on Thursday, let us say.”</p>
<p>3．So’t was arranged; but Ching was wide-awake:</p>
<p>Time by the forelock he resolved to take;</p>
<p>And to the temple went at once, and read,</p>
<p>Upon the tablet, “To the illustrious dead,</p>
<p>The chief of mandarins (8) , the great Goh-Bang.”</p>
<p>Scarce had he gone when stealthily came Chang,</p>
<p>Who read the same; but peering closer, he</p>
<p>Spied in a corner what Ching failed to see—</p>
<p>The words, “This tablet is erected here</p>
<p>By those to whom the great Goh-Bang was dear.”</p>
<p>4．So on the appointed day—both innocent</p>
<p>As babes, of course—these honest fellows went,</p>
<p>And took their distant station; and Ching said,</p>
<p>“I can read plainly, ’To the illustrious dead,</p>
<p>The chief of mandarins, the great Goh-Bang.’”</p>
<p>“And is that all that you can spell?” said Chang;</p>
<p>“I see what you have read, but furthermore,</p>
<p>In smaller letters, toward the temple door,</p>
<p>Quite plain, ’This tablet is erected here</p>
<p>By those to whom the great Goh-Bang was dear.’”</p>
<p>5．“My sharp-eyed friend, there are no such words!” said Ching.</p>
<p>“They’re there,” said Chang, “if I see anything,</p>
<p>As clear as daylight.” “Patent (9) eyes, indeed,</p>
<p>You have!” cried Ching; “do you think I can not read?”</p>
<p>“Not at this distance as I can,” Chang said,</p>
<p>“If what you say you saw is all you read.”</p>
<p>6．In fine, they quarreled, and their wrath increased,</p>
<p>Till Chang said, “Let us leave it to the priest;</p>
<p>Lo! here he comes to meet us,” “It is well,”</p>
<p>Said honest Ching; “no falsehood he will tell.”</p>
<p>7．The good man heard their artless story through,</p>
<p>And said, “I think, dear sirs, there must be few</p>
<p>Blest with such wondrous eyes as those you wear:</p>
<p>There’s no such tablet or inscription there!</p>
<p>There was one, it is true; ’t was moved away</p>
<p>And placed within the temple yesterday.”</p>

<p>1．两个近视的年轻人，常和秦，</p>
<p>在饭桌上闲聊起来，</p>
<p>后来两人争执谁的眼力好。</p>
<p>最后他们决定来场竞赛。</p>
<p>常说：“我听说，一块大石碑</p>
<p>立在附近的庙前，</p>
<p>碑上刻着碑文。我们去看看</p>
<p>谁能读出来（既然你吹嘘自己眼力好）。</p>
<p>一起站在碑前一个地方，</p>
<p>只能依稀看见碑上的文字，</p>
<p>谁能最快读出碑文，</p>
<p>谁就赢了这场视力竞赛。”</p>
<p>秦说：“我同意，我们尽快比赛，</p>
<p>明天下午怎么样？”</p>
<p>2．“不行，不能太快。”常说：“我明天</p>
<p>骑马从黄河出发，一天的行程，</p>
<p>后天才能回来。</p>
<p>星期四上午十点我们再比赛。”</p>
<p>3．就这样决定了，但秦却十分机警。</p>
<p>他一点时间都不耽误，</p>
<p>立刻来到寺庙，读着</p>
<p>碑上的文字：“致那些壮烈牺牲的烈士，</p>
<p>满洲的首领，伟大的高邦。”</p>
<p>他刚离开，常就偷偷地来了，</p>
<p>他也读到了同样的碑文，但靠近一看，</p>
<p>他发现角落里有秦没有发现的碑文——</p>
<p>“此碑由敬仰伟大的高邦的</p>
<p>人所立。”</p>
<p>4．这样在约定的日子——两人如婴儿一般</p>
<p>诚实的人来了，</p>
<p>远远地站好，秦说：</p>
<p>“我很容易就能看见：’致那些壮烈牺牲的烈士，</p>
<p>满洲的首领，伟大的高邦。’”</p>
<p>“你看见的就这些吗？”常说。</p>
<p>“我还看见你刚才没读的，并且</p>
<p>字体更小，靠近寺庙的门，</p>
<p>非常清楚：’此碑由敬仰伟大的高邦的</p>
<p>人所立。’”</p>
<p>5．“我好眼神的朋友，没有这样的文字！”秦说。</p>
<p>常反驳：“就在那儿呢。我看到的一切，</p>
<p>都像日光一样清楚。”“真是好眼力啊！”秦说，</p>
<p>“你以为我不识字吗？”</p>
<p>常说：“像我一样离这么远就不行，</p>
<p>如果你说你刚才读的就是看见的所有文字。”</p>
<p>6．他们越吵越凶，怒气冲冲，</p>
<p>最后常说：“我们找庙里的住持来裁判吧，</p>
<p>看，他走过来了。”“很好，”</p>
<p>诚实的常说：“住持是不会说谎的。”</p>
<p>7．住持完完整整听了他们所述，</p>
<p>说：“两位尊敬的先生，我以为</p>
<p>世上很少有人像二位这样的好眼力。</p>
<p>这里根本就没有墓碑和碑文！</p>
<p>以前的确有，没错，但昨天</p>
<p>我们把它搬到寺庙里面了。”</p>

<h2 id="lesson-59-the-way-to-be-happy">LESSON 59 THE WAY TO BE
HAPPY</h2>
<p>幸福之道</p>
<p>1．Every child must observe how much more happy and beloved some
children are than others. There are some children you always love to be
with. They are happy themselves, and they make you happy.</p>
<p>2．There are others whom you always avoid. They seem to have no
friends. No person can be happy without friends. The heart is formed for
love, and can not be happy without it.</p>
<p>3．“’t is not in titles nor in rank,</p>
<p>’T is not in wealth like London bank,</p>
<p>To make us truly blest.</p>
<p>If happiness have not her seat</p>
<p>And center in the breast,</p>
<p>We may be wise, or rich, or great,</p>
<p>But never can be blest.”</p>
<p>4．But you can not receive affection unless you will also give it.
You can not find others to love you unless you will also love them. Love
is only to be obtained by giving love in return. Hence the importance of
cultivating (1) a good disposition. You can not be happy without it.</p>
<p>5．I have sometimes heard a girl say, “I know that I am very
unpopular (2) at school.” Now, this plainly shows that she is not
amiable.</p>
<p>6．If your companions (3) do not love you, it is your own fault. They
can not help loving you if you will be kind and friendly. If you are not
loved, it is a good proof that you do not deserve to be loved. It is
true that a sense of duty may, at times, render it necessary for you to
do that which will displease your companions.</p>
<p>7．But if it is seen that you have a noble spirit, that you are above
selfishness, that you are willing to make sacrifices (4) to promote (5)
the happiness of others, you will never be in want of friends.</p>
<p>8．You must not regard it as your misfortune that others do not love
you, but your fault. It is not beauty, it is not wealth, that will give
you friends. Your heart must glow with kindness, if you would attract to
yourself the esteem and affection of those around you.</p>
<p>9．You are little aware how much the happiness of your whole life
depends upon the cultivation of a good disposition. If you will adopt
the resolution that you will confer favors whenever you can, you will
certainly be surrounded by ardent friends. Begin upon this principle in
childhood, and act upon it through life, and you will make yourself
happy, and promote the happiness of all within your influence.</p>
<p>10．You go to school on a cold winter morning. A bright fire is
blazing in the stove, surrounded with boys struggling to get near it to
warm themselves. After you are slightly warmed, a schoolmate comes in
suffering (6) with cold. “Here, James,” you pleasantly call out to him,
“I am almost warm; you may have my place.”</p>
<p>11．As you slip aside to allow him to take your place at the fire,
will he not feel that you are kind? The worst boy in the world can not
help admiring such generosity (7) ; and, even though he be so ungrateful
as not to return the favor, you may depend upon it that he will be your
friend as far as he is capable of friendship. If you will always act
upon this principle, you will never want for friends.</p>
<p>12．Suppose, some day, you are out with your companions playing ball.
After you have been playing for some time, another boy comes along. He
can not be chosen upon either side, for there is no one to match him.
“Henry,” you say, “you may take my place a little while, and I will
rest.”</p>
<p>13．You throw yourself down upon the grass, while Henry, fresh and
vigorous, takes your bat and engages in the game. He knows that you give
up to oblige him, and how can he help liking you for it? The fact is,
that neither man nor child can cultivate such a spirit of generosity and
kindness without attracting affection and esteem.</p>
<p>14．Look and see which of your companions have the most friends, and
you will find that they are those who have this noble spirit; who are
willing to deny themselves, that they may make others happy. There is
but one way to make friends; and that is, by being friendly to
others.</p>
<p>15．Perhaps some child who reads this feels conscious of being
disliked, and yet desires to have the affection of his companions. You
ask me what you shall do. I will tell you. I will give you an infallible
(8) rule: Do all in your power to make others happy. Be willing to make
sacrifices, that you may promote the happiness of others.</p>
<p>16．This is the way to make friends, and the only way. When you are
playing with your brothers and sisters at home, be always ready to give
them more than their share of privileges. Manifest (9) an obliging
disposition, and they can not but regard you with affection. In all your
intercourse (10) with others, at home or abroad, let these feelings
influence you, and you will receive a rich reward.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is this lesson about? Can we be happy without
friends? How can we win the love of those about us? Whose fault is it if
we are not loved? What rule will surely gain us love and friendship if
we always follow it?</p>

<p>1．你可能会注意到，有些孩子比其他人要幸福得多，被宠爱得多。有些孩子，你就是喜欢和他们在一起。他们自己很幸福，也会让你感觉幸福。</p>
<p>2．还有些孩子，你总是想方设法躲避。他们似乎没有朋友。任何人没有朋友都会感觉不幸福。人心是为爱而生的，没有爱，人就不会幸福。</p>
<p>3．“让我们真正幸福的</p>
<p>不是名声，不是荣誉，</p>
<p>也不是同伦敦银行一样多的财富，</p>
<p>如果我们心中</p>
<p>没有幸福的位置，</p>
<p>我们可能很聪明、很富有、很伟大，</p>
<p>但永远不会真正幸福。”</p>
<p>4．只有你愿意付出情感，你才能收获情感。只有你同样爱别人，别人才会爱你。只有付出了爱，才会反过来收获爱。因此培养好的性格非常重要。没有它，你就不会幸福。</p>
<p>5．一天，我听到一个女孩说：“我知道我在学校很不受欢迎。”看，这就简单地说明了她不可爱。</p>
<p>6．如果你的同伴不爱你，那是你自己的过错。如果你愿意做一个善良友爱的人，他们无法不爱你。如果人们不爱你，这也很好地证明了你不值得被爱。确实，有时候责任感可能会让你做一些让同伴们不那么高兴的事。</p>
<p>7．但是，如果大家看到你的精神是高尚的，你并不自私，你愿意为他人的幸福做出自己的牺牲，你就永远不会缺少朋友。</p>
<p>8．你不要认为其他人不爱你是你运气不好，相反，这是你的过错。能给你带来朋友的，不是美貌，不是财富。如果你想要获得周围人的尊重和喜爱，你的心灵必须闪耀着友善之光。</p>
<p>9．你可能还不知道，你一生的幸福和你良好性格的养成有多大的关系。如果你决定能够尽己所能随时为他人提供帮助，你一定会被热情的朋友包围。从小相信这一点，并且一生将其付诸行动，你将会非常幸福，并使受你影响的人更幸福。</p>
<p>10．你在寒冷的冬日早晨去上学。学校的炉火里，明亮的火焰跳跃着，孩子们挤在火炉旁烤火取暖。你刚刚有点暖和，一个浑身发冷的同学过来了。“来，詹姆斯，”你高兴地叫他，“我差不多暖和了，你来我这儿烤吧。”</p>
<p>11．你站到一边去，让他在你的位置烤火，他难道不会觉得你人很好吗？就连世界上最坏的孩子也会喜欢你的慷慨大方，即使他不觉得感激，不会予以回报，你依然可以相信，只要他具有交友的能力，他就是你的朋友。只要你总是奉行这个原则，你永远不会缺少朋友的。</p>
<p>12．假如有一天你和你的伙伴们在玩球。你们玩了一会儿之后，又来了一个男孩。因为哪边都不缺人手，两边都不愿意选他。你说：“亨利，你代替我的位置玩会儿吧，我休息休息。”</p>
<p>13．你自己躺在草地上，亨利活力四射地接替你加入比赛，和大家玩耍起来。他知道你放弃自己玩耍来帮助他，他怎么能不喜欢你呢？事实就是，无论是大人还是小孩，只要养成了这样慷慨和善的品格，他就会获得爱和尊重。</p>
<p>14．看看你的伙伴中，谁的朋友最多，你就会发现他们就是具备这种高贵品格的人，他们愿意牺牲自己，他们能够让别人感觉幸福。交朋友只有唯一一种方法，那就是：成为别人的朋友。</p>
<p>15．可能有些读到这篇文章的孩子知道自己不招人喜欢，但又想获得同伴的友谊。你问我该怎么做。我来告诉你吧。我给你一条绝对有效的法则：尽你所能让别人幸福。愿意为提升别人的幸福做出自己的牺牲。</p>
<p>16．这就是交到朋友的方式，也是唯一的方式。在家和你的兄弟姐妹玩耍时，你应该总是愿意给予他们更多的权利。展示你乐于助人的性格，他们肯定会把爱心给你。无论在家还是在外面，和人交往时，永远带着这种感情，你就会获得丰厚的回报。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-60-the-giraffe-or-camelopard">LESSON 60 THE GIRAFFE, OR
CAMELOPARD</h2>
<p>长颈鹿</p>
<p>1．The giraffe is a native of Africa. It is of singular shape and
size, and bears some resemblance both to the camel and the deer. The
mouth is small; the eyes are full and brilliant (1) ; the tongue is
rough, very long, and ending in a point. The neck is long and slender,
and, from the shoulder to the top of the head, it measures between seven
and eight feet; from the ground to the top of the shoulder, it is
commonly ten or eleven feet; so that the height of a full-grown giraffe
is seventeen or eighteen feet.</p>
<p>2．The hair is of a deep brown color in the male, and of a light or
yellowish brown in the female. The skin is beautifully diversified (2)
with white spots. They have short, blunt horns, and hoofs like those of
the ox. In their wild state, they feed on the leaves of a gum-bearing
tree peculiar (3) to warm climates.</p>
<p>3．The giraffe, like the horse and other hoofed animals, defends
itself by kicking; and its hinder limbs are so light, and its blows so
rapid, that the eye can not follow them. They are sufficient for its
defense against the lion. It never employs its horns in resisting the
attack of an enemy. Its disposition is gentle, and it flees to its
native forest upon the least alarm.</p>
<p>4．Le Vaillant (the celebrated French traveler and naturalist (4) )
was the first who gave us any exact account of the form and habits of
the giraffe. While he was traveling in South Africa, he happened one day
to discover a hut covered with the skin of one of those animals; and
learned to his surprise that he was now in a part of the country where
the creature was found. He could not rest contented until he had seen
the animal alive, and had secured a specimen (5) .</p>
<p>5．Having on several days obtained sight of some of them, he, with
his attendants, on horseback and accompanied with dogs, gave chase; but
they baffled (6) all pursuit. After a chase of a whole day, which
effected nothing but the fatigue (7) of the party, he began to despair
of success.</p>
<p>6．“The next day,” says he, “by sunrise, I was in pursuit of game, in
the hope of obtaining some provisions for my men. After several hours’
fatigue, we saw, at the turn of a hill, seven giraffes, which my pack of
dogs instantly pursued. Six of them went off together; but the seventh,
cut off by my dogs, took another way.</p>
<p>7．“I followed the single one at full speed, but, in spite of the
efforts of my horse, she got so much ahead of me, that, in turning a
little hill, I lost sight of her altogether, and I gave up the pursuit.
My dogs, however, were not so easily exhausted. They were soon so close
upon her that she was obliged to stop and defend herself. From the noise
they made, I conjectured (8) that they had got the animal into a corner,
and I again pushed forward.</p>
<p>8．“I had scarcely got round the hill, when I perceived her
surrounded by the dogs, and endeavoring to drive them away by heavy
kicks. In a moment I was on my feet, and a shot from my carbine (9)
brought her to the earth. I was delighted with my victory, which enabled
me to add to the riches of natural history. I was now able, also, to
destroy the romance (10) which attached to this animal, and to establish
the truth of its existence.”</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Of what country is the giraffe a native? To what height
does it attain when full grown? On what does it live? How does it defend
itself? Relate the story of Le Vaillant’s giraffe hunt.</p>

<p>1．长颈鹿是非洲本地的动物，它们的外形和尺寸非常独特，既像骆驼，又像鹿。它们的嘴巴很小，眼睛又大又亮，舌头粗糙，而且很长，舌尖是尖尖的。长颈鹿的脖子又细又长，从肩到头顶有七八英尺，而从地面到肩部，又有十到十一英尺，所以一只成年的长颈鹿高约十七八英尺。</p>
<p>2．雄性长颈鹿的毛是深棕色，雌性长颈鹿是浅棕或者棕黄色。长颈鹿的毛皮上点缀着白色斑点。长颈鹿有短短的角，并不尖锐，蹄子和牛很相似。野生状态的长颈鹿吃一种含树胶的叶子，这种树是气候温暖的地区特有的。</p>
<p>3．像马和其他蹄类动物一样，长颈鹿用踢蹆来自卫。它们的后肢非常灵巧，行动非常迅速，人的肉眼甚至跟不上。这使得长颈鹿甚至可以和狮子对抗。它们从来不用角来对付敌人。长颈鹿脾气很温和，一有轻微的警报就会跑回原始森林。</p>
<p>4．勒·瓦杨（法国著名旅行家和博物学家）是第一个详细描述长颈鹿外形和生活习性的人。在南非旅行时，一天他碰巧发现一个棚屋上覆盖着长颈鹿的鹿皮，他惊讶地了解到这里就是发现长颈鹿的地方。除非亲自看到野生的长颈鹿，并获得标本，否则他无法安心。</p>
<p>5．后来，接连几天他都看到了长颈鹿，他和助手骑着马，带着猎犬，开始追踪，但一直追不到。这样追了一整天之后，他的团队除了疲劳之外，一无所获，他开始对成功失去信心了。</p>
<p>6．他说：“第二天天一亮，我就开始追击猎物，希望给跟随我的人弄些吃的。几个小时之后，很累了，在一个山丘的转弯处我们看见七只长颈鹿，猎犬立刻追了过去。其中的六只都向一个方向逃跑了，不过第七只被我的猎犬拦截了，向另一个方向跑去。</p>
<p>7．“我全速追击落单的这只长颈鹿，我的马使出全身力气，它还是远远地在我们前面，在山丘转弯的时候，我跟丢了，只好放弃追踪。不过我的猎犬可没那么容易累。它们很快追上了长颈鹿，它只好停下来抵抗。听见它们的声音，我估计猎犬把长颈鹿困住了，我重新骑马追上去。</p>
<p>8．“刚绕过山丘，我就看见长颈鹿被猎犬包围着，想要用力把它们踢走。我立刻跳下马，用卡宾枪把它打倒在地上。很高兴我胜利了，这让我能够为博物学增添新的财富做出贡献。我也打破了长颈鹿的浪漫神话，证明它们真的存在。”</p>

<h2 id="lesson-61-the-lost-child">LESSON 61 THE LOST CHILD</h2>
<p>失踪的孩子</p>
<p>1．A few years since, a child was lost in the woods. He was out with
his brothers and sisters gathering berries, and was accidentally
separated (1) from them, and lost. The children, after looking in vain
for some time in search of the little wanderer, returned, just in the
dusk of the evening, to inform their parents that their brother was lost
and could not be found.</p>
<p>2．The woods, at that time, were full of bears. The darkness of a
cloudy night was rapidly coming on, and the alarmed father, gathering a
few of his neighbors, hastened in search of the lost child. The mother
remained at home, almost distracted (2) with suspense (3) .</p>
<p>3．As the clouds gathered, and the darkness increased, the father and
the neighbors, with highly excited fears, traversed (4) the woods in all
directions, and raised loud shouts to attract the attention of the
child. But their search was in vain. They could find no trace of the
wanderer; and, as they stood under the boughs of the lofty trees, and
listened, that if possible they might hear his feeble voice, no sound
was borne to their ears but the melancholy moaning of the wind as it
swept through the thick branches of the forest.</p>
<p>4．The gathering clouds threatened an approaching storm, and the deep
darkness of the night had already enveloped them. It is difficult to
conceive what were the feelings of that father. And who could imagine
how deep the distress which filled the bosom of that mother, as she
heard the wind, and beheld the darkness in which her child was
wandering!</p>
<p>5．The search was continued in vain till nine o’clock in the evening.
Then, one of the party was sent back to the village, to collect the
inhabitants for a more extensive search. The bell rung the alarm, and
the cry of fire resounded through the streets. It was ascertained (5) ,
however, that it was not fire which caused the alarm, but that the bell
tolled the more solemn tidings of a lost child.</p>
<p>6．Every heart sympathized (6) in the sorrows of the distracted
parents. Soon, multitudes of the people were seen ascending the hill,
upon the declivity (7) of which the village stood, to aid in the search.
Ere long, the rain began to fall, but no tidings came back to the
village of the lost child. Hardly an eye was that night closed in sleep,
and there was not a mother who did not feel for the parents.</p>
<p>7．The night passed away, and the morning dawned, and yet no tidings
came. At last, those engaged in the search met together and held a
consultation (8) . They made arrangements for a more minute search, and
agreed that, in case the child was found, a gun should be fired, to give
a signal to the rest of the party.</p>
<p>8．As the sun arose, the clouds were scattered, and the whole
landscape (9) glittered in the rays of the bright morning. But that
village was deserted and still. The stores were closed, and business was
hushed. Mothers were walking the streets, with sympathizing countenances
and anxious hearts. There was but one thought in every mind: “What has
become of the lost child?”</p>
<p>9．All the affections and interest of the neighborhood were flowing
in one deep and broad channel toward the little wanderer. About nine in
the morning, the signal gun was fired, which announced that the child
was found; and, for a moment, how dreadful was the suspense! Was it
found a mangled corpse? or was it alive and well?</p>
<p>10．Soon, a joyful shout proclaimed (10) the safety of the child. The
shout was borne from tongue to tongue, till the whole forest rang again
with the joyful sound. A messenger rapidly bore the tidings to the
distracted mother. A procession was immediately formed by those engaged
in the search. The child was placed upon a platform, hastily formed from
the boughs of trees, and borne in triumph at the head of the procession.
When they arrived at the brow of the hill, they rested for a moment, and
proclaimed their success with three loud and animated cheers.</p>
<p>11．The procession (11) then moved on till they arrived in front of
the dwelling where the parents of the child resided. The mother, who
stood at the door, with streaming eyes and throbbing heart, could no
longer restrain herself or her feelings.</p>
<p>12．She rushed into the street, clasped her child to her bosom, and
wept aloud. Every eye was filled with tears, and, for a moment, all were
silent. But suddenly some one gave a signal for a shout. One loud, and
long, and happy note of joy rose from the assembled multitude, and they
went to their business and their homes.</p>
<p>13．There was more joy over the one child that was found than over
the ninety and nine that went not astray. Likewise, there is joy in the
presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. But still,
this is a feeble representation (12) of the love of our Father in heaven
for us, and of the joy with which the angels welcome the returning
wanderer.</p>
<p>14．The mother can not feel for her child that is lost as God feels
for the unhappy wanderer in the paths of sin. If a mother can feel so
much, what must be the feelings of our Father in heaven for those who
have strayed from his love? If man can feel so deep a sympathy, what
must be the emotions which glow in the bosom of angels?</p>

<p>1．几年前，一个孩子在树林里走丢了。他本来是和兄弟姐妹们到树林里摘果子，意外地和他们分开了，就这样走丢了。那些孩子们努力寻找这个走丢的孩子，最后却是徒劳，他们在夜幕降临的时候回到家里，告诉他们的父母他们的兄弟走丢的消息。</p>
<p>2．那时候，森林里有很多狗熊。乌云密布的黑暗的夜晚就要降临了，警醒的父亲，带领着他的几个邻居，迅速去寻找走丢的孩子。母亲在家里等待，几乎要被焦虑折磨疯了。</p>
<p>3．乌云聚集，天色越来越暗，父亲和几个邻居极端恐惧，他们在树林的每一个方向寻找，大声叫着想要引起那个走丢的孩子的注意。但是，他们一无所获。找不到任何踪迹。他们在大树下仔细倾听，看看是否能够听到这孩子微弱的声音，可是，除了风吹过树林里茂密的树枝发出的令人沮丧的呼啸声之外，什么也听不到。</p>
<p>4．乌云越聚越多，预示着暴风雨要来临，漆黑的夜已经包围了他们。很难想象这个父亲此刻在想什么。谁又能够想象，那个母亲听着呼啸的风声，看着无边的黑暗，想到她走丢的孩子，心里是多么悲伤啊！</p>
<p>5．他们继续寻找，直到晚上九点，依然一无所获。随后，他们派了一个人回到村庄，召集更多的村民进行更彻底的搜索。警报鸣响，失火的叫喊声响彻大街，然后，后来人们明白，鸣响警报并不是因为失火，而是因为更严重的事情——一个孩子走丢了。</p>
<p>6．每个人的心中都对这对心慌意乱的父母感到同情。很快，更多的人来到这座村庄所依傍的山上，帮助寻找孩子。很快，开始下雨了，但并没有关于这个走失的孩子的消息传回村庄。那天夜里，几乎没人睡觉，没有哪个母亲不为那对父母而悲伤。</p>
<p>7．黑夜很快过去，黎明降临，还是没有消息。最后，那些参与寻找的人聚在一起，商量对策。他们安排了更详细的寻找计划，一致同意，如果找到孩子，就要向空中鸣枪，给其他人报信。</p>
<p>8．太阳升起来，乌云散去，清晨明亮的光线覆盖了整片大地。但是，那个村庄像没有人居住一样宁静。商店关门了，生意暂停了。走在街上的母亲们都露出同情的神色，内心十分焦急。每个人的心中只有一个想法：“那个走失的孩子怎么样了？”</p>
<p>9．整个村庄的居民把情感和关注都汇集在那个走失的小孩身上。约莫早上九点的时候，有人鸣响了信号枪，也就是说，孩子找到了。一时间，人们又开始纷纷猜测：找到的是孩子的尸体吗？还是健健康康地活着呢？</p>
<p>10．很快，欢乐的喊声宣布孩子是安全的。人们口口相传，整个森林里都是人们欢乐的声音。很快有人把这消息告诉了焦虑中的母亲。参与寻找的人立刻形成队列，队列的最前端人们胜利地抬着孩子，把他放在一个临时由树枝做成的平台上。到达山顶的时候，他们停下来休息了一会儿。他们高声热烈地欢呼了三次，以此来宣告他们的胜利。</p>
<p>11．队伍继续行进，最终停在孩子父母的住所前。母亲站在门口，泪如雨下，心如刀割，再也控制不住她的感情了。</p>
<p>12．她冲到街上，把孩子紧紧抱在怀里，大声哭了起来。一时间，每双眼睛都充满泪水，所有人都鸦雀无声。但突然间，有人发出了一声欢呼，人群中发出了长长的喜悦的欢呼声，随后他们返回自己的工作、返回自己家里。</p>
<p>13．一个失踪的孩子带给人们的喜悦远远超过九十九个从未失踪的更多。同样，在上帝的天使面前，一个罪人的忏悔也一样令人喜悦。这确实代表了天堂里上帝对于我们的爱，以及天使欢迎浪子回头的喜悦。</p>
<p>14．母亲对走失的孩子的感情，无法同上帝对犯罪的游子产生的感情相比。如果一个母亲能有那么多的感受，那么上帝对于迷失了爱的浪子又当如何感受？如果连人们都会如此同情，天使的心里又有着怎样的感受？</p>

<h2 id="lesson-62-which">LESSON 62 WHICH?</h2>
<p>哪一个？</p>
<p>1．Which shall it be? Which shall it be?</p>
<p>I looked at John—John looked at me;</p>
<p>Dear, patient John, who loves me yet</p>
<p>As well as though my locks were jet.</p>
<p>And when I found that I must speak,</p>
<p>My voice seemed strangely low and weak:</p>
<p>“Tell me again what Robert said!”</p>
<p>And then I, listening, bent my head.</p>
<p>“This is his letter:”</p>
<p>2．“’I will give</p>
<p>A house and land while you shall live,</p>
<p>If, in return, from out your seven,</p>
<p>One child to me for aye (1) is given.’”</p>
<p>I looked at John’s old garments worn,</p>
<p>I thought of all that John had borne</p>
<p>Of poverty, and work, and care,</p>
<p>Which I, though willing, could not share;</p>
<p>I thought of seven mouths to feed,</p>
<p>Of seven little children’s need,</p>
<p>And then of this.</p>
<p>3．“Come, John,” said I,</p>
<p>“We’ll choose among them as they lie</p>
<p>Asleep;” so, walking hand in hand,</p>
<p>Dear John and I surveyed (2) our band.</p>
<p>First to the cradle light we stepped,</p>
<p>Where Lilian the baby slept,</p>
<p>A glory ’gainst the pillow white.</p>
<p>Softly the father stooped to lay</p>
<p>His rough hand down in loving way,</p>
<p>When dream or whisper made her stir,</p>
<p>And huskily he said: “Not her!”</p>
<p>4．We stooped beside the trundle-bed,</p>
<p>And one long ray of lamplight shed</p>
<p>Athwart the boyish faces there,</p>
<p>In sleep so pitiful and fair;</p>
<p>I saw on Jamie’s rough, red cheek,</p>
<p>A tear undried. Ere John could speak,</p>
<p>“He’s but a baby, too,” said I,</p>
<p>And kissed him as we hurried by.</p>
<p>5．Pale, patient Robbie’s angel face</p>
<p>Still in his sleep bore suffering’s trace:</p>
<p>“No, for a thousand crowns (3) , not him,”</p>
<p>He whispered, while our eyes were dim.</p>
<p>6．Poor Dick! bad Dick! our wayward (4) son,</p>
<p>Turbulent (5) , reckless, idle one—</p>
<p>Could he be spared? “Nay, He who gave,</p>
<p>Bade us befriend him to the grave;</p>
<p>Only a mother’s heart can be</p>
<p>Patient enough for such as he;</p>
<p>And so,” said John, “I would not dare</p>
<p>To send him from her bedside prayer.”</p>
<p>7．Then stole we softly up above</p>
<p>And knelt by Mary, child of love.</p>
<p>“Perhaps for her ’t would better be,”</p>
<p>I said to John. Quite silently</p>
<p>He lifted up a curl that lay</p>
<p>Across her cheek in willful way,</p>
<p>And shook his head. “Nay, love, not thee,”</p>
<p>The while my heart beat audibly.</p>
<p>8．Only one more, our eldest lad,</p>
<p>Trusty and truthful, good and glad</p>
<p>So like his father. “No, John, no—</p>
<p>I can not, will not let him go.”</p>
<p>9．And so we wrote in courteous (6) way,</p>
<p>We could not drive one child away.</p>
<p>And afterward, toil lighter seemed,</p>
<p>Thinking of that of which we dreamed;</p>
<p>Happy, in truth, that not one face</p>
<p>We missed from its accustomed (7) place;</p>
<p>Thankful to work for all the seven,</p>
<p>Trusting the rest to One in heaven!</p>

<p>1．选哪个呢？选哪个呢？</p>
<p>我看看约翰，约翰看看我，</p>
<p>亲爱的耐心的约翰，他如此爱我，</p>
<p>就像钥匙爱着锁。</p>
<p>当我意识到必须说些什么时，</p>
<p>我的声音异常低沉微弱：</p>
<p>“再跟我说一遍罗伯特说了什么。”</p>
<p>接下来我低下头听着：</p>
<p>“这是他的来信：”</p>
<p>2．“我会给你</p>
<p>一座房子、一些地供你居住生活，</p>
<p>但作为回报，你的七个孩子中，</p>
<p>有一个要永远过继给我。”</p>
<p>我看着约翰破旧的衣衫，</p>
<p>想着他所承受的一切，</p>
<p>贫穷、辛苦、生活的重担，</p>
<p>我虽然有心，却无力分担，</p>
<p>我想着七张等吃饭的嘴，</p>
<p>要满足七个孩子的需要，</p>
<p>又想到了这封信。</p>
<p>3．我说：“约翰，过来。”</p>
<p>“我们现在选吧，他们都睡着了。”</p>
<p>手牵着手，</p>
<p>亲爱的约翰和我看着我们的孩子。</p>
<p>我们先来到摇篮的灯光下，</p>
<p>宝贝莉莉安正熟睡，</p>
<p>她就是躺在枕头上的一道光芒，</p>
<p>他的爸弯下腰，</p>
<p>粗糙的大手充满爱意地抚摸孩子，</p>
<p>也许是梦境，也许是我们的低语让她动了一下，</p>
<p>他沙哑着嗓子说：“不能把她送人！”</p>
<p>4．我们站在小床边，</p>
<p>油灯的光线照在</p>
<p>两个男孩的脸庞，</p>
<p>睡梦中的孩子们如此迷人让人怜爱，</p>
<p>看见杰米红红的小脸上，</p>
<p>挂着未干的眼泪。没等约翰说话，</p>
<p>我就已经开口：“他也只是个婴儿。”</p>
<p>亲吻了他，我们匆匆离开。</p>
<p>5．生病的罗比脸色苍白，天使般的脸庞</p>
<p>睡梦中还露出痛苦的模样：</p>
<p>“不行，即使给我一千克朗，也不能把他送人。”</p>
<p>约翰这样说，我们的眼睛都黯淡起来。</p>
<p>6．可怜的迪克，淘气的迪克，我们这个淘气的儿子，</p>
<p>捣乱、毛手毛脚、懒惰的家伙——</p>
<p>可以把他送人吗？“不行，把他赐予我们的人</p>
<p>嘱咐我们今生都要好好待他，</p>
<p>只有母亲的心，</p>
<p>才会对这样的孩子足够耐心，</p>
<p>“所以，”约翰说，“我可不敢</p>
<p>让他离开妈妈的身边。”</p>
<p>7．我们悄悄地来到</p>
<p>可爱的孩子玛丽身边，</p>
<p>“也许送走她对她更好。”</p>
<p>我对约翰说。他默默地，</p>
<p>捋起她脸上金色的头发，</p>
<p>摇了摇头：“不行，亲爱的，不能送她。”</p>
<p>这时我能听见自己的心跳声。</p>
<p>8．只有最后一个了，我们最大的孩子，</p>
<p>忠诚又值得信赖，最善良也最欢乐——</p>
<p>和他的父亲如此相像。“不行，约翰，不要，</p>
<p>我不能，也不会让他走的。”</p>
<p>9．所以，我们非常礼貌地回了信，</p>
<p>我们无法送走任何一个孩子。</p>
<p>尽管送走后，我们可能不会这么辛苦，</p>
<p>虽然这是我们梦寐以求的。</p>
<p>真的，很高兴我们没有让</p>
<p>任何一个孩子离开原来的地方。</p>
<p>心存感激，为七个孩子劳作，</p>
<p>其余的一切，信赖天堂里的神吧。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-63-the-pet-fawn">LESSON 63 THE PET FAWN</h2>
<p>宠物鹿</p>
<p>1．A pretty little fawn (1) had been brought in from the woods, when
very young, and nursed and petted by a lady in the village until it had
become as tame as possible. It was graceful, as those little creatures
always are, and so gentle and playful that it became a great favorite,
following the different members of the family about, being caressed (2)
by the neighbors, and welcome everywhere.</p>
<p>2．One morning, after playing about as usual until weary, it lay down
in the sunshine, at the feet of one of its friends, upon the steps of a
store. There came along a countryman, who for several years had been a
hunter by pursuit, and who still kept several hounds, one of which was
now with him.</p>
<p>3．The dog, as it approached the spot where the fawn lay, suddenly
stopped. The little animal saw him, and started to its feet. It had
lived more than half its life among the dogs of the village, and had
apparently lost all fear of them; but it seemed now to know that an
enemy was near. In an instant, its whole nature seemed changed; all its
past habits were forgotten; every wild impulse was awake; its head
erect, its nostrils dilated (3) , its eyes flashing.</p>
<p>4．In another instant, before the spectators (4) had thought of the
danger, and before its friends could secure it, the fawn was bounding
away through the street, and the hound in full chase. The bystanders
were eager to save it; several persons immediately followed its track;
the friends who had long fed and fondled it, calling the name it had
hitherto known, in vain.</p>
<p>5．The hunter endeavored to whistle back his dog, but with no
success. In half a minute the fawn had turned the first corner, dashed
onward toward the lake, and thrown itself into the water. But if for a
moment the startled creature believed itself safe in the cool bosom of
the lake, it was soon undeceived; for the hound followed in hot and
eager chase, while a dozen village dogs joined blindly in the
pursuit.</p>
<p>6．A large crowd collected on the bank—men, women, and
children—anxious for the fate of the little animal so well known to them
all. Some threw themselves into boats, hoping to intercept (5) the hound
before he reached his prey. The plashing of the oars, the eager voices
of men and boys, and the barking of the dogs, must have filled the heart
of the poor fawn with terror and anguish,—as though every creature on
the spot where it had once been caressed and fondled, had suddenly
turned into a deadly foe.</p>
<p>7．It was soon seen that the little animal was directing its course
across a bay toward the nearest borders of the forest. Immediately the
owner of the hound crossed the bridge, and ran at full speed, hoping to
stop his dog as he landed. On swam the fawn, as it never swam before;
its delicate head scarcely seen above the water, but leaving a disturbed
track, which betrayed (6) its course alike to its friends and foes.</p>
<p>8．As it approached the land, the interest became intense (7) . The
hunter was already on the same side of the lake, calling loudly and
angrily to his dog; but the hound seemed to have quite forgotten his
master’s voice in the pitiless pursuit. The fawn reached the shore. With
a leap it had crossed the narrow strip of beach, and in another instant
it would reach the cover of the woods.</p>
<p>9．The hound followed true to the scent (8) , pointing to the same
spot on the shore; his master, anxious to meet him, had run at full
speed, and was now coming up at the same critical moment. Will the dog
listen to his voice? or can the hunter reach him in time to seize and
control him? A shout from the bank told that the fawn had passed out of
sight into the forest. At the same instant, the hound, as he touched the
land, felt the hunter’s strong arm clutching his neck. The worst was
believed to be over; the fawn was leaping up the mountain side, and its
enemy was restrained. The other dogs, seeing their leader cowed (9) ,
were easily managed.</p>
<p>10．A number of persons, men and boys, dispersed themselves through
the woods in search of the little creature, but without success; they
all returned to the village, reporting that the fawn had not been seen.
Some thought that after its fright had passed it would return of its own
accord. It wore a pretty collar with its owner’s name engraved upon it,
so that it could be easily known from any other fawn that might be
straying about the woods.</p>
<p>11．Before many hours had passed, a hunter presented himself to the
lady whose pet the little creature had been, and showed a collar with
her name upon it. He said that he was out hunting in the morning, and
saw a fawn in the distance. The little pet, instead of bounding away, as
he expected, moved toward him; he took aim, fired, and shot it through
the heart.</p>

<p>1．一只漂亮的小鹿在很小的时候，就被人从树林里带了回来，村子里一位女士把它当宠物驯养，它也变得特别驯服。像别的小动物一样，小鹿非常优雅，也非常温和、好玩，没人不喜欢它，它跟着不同的家庭成员到处走，邻居们也常常抚摸它，它到哪儿都很受欢迎。</p>
<p>2．一天早上，小鹿像平常一样到处玩，玩累了就在一家商店的台阶上休息，趴在一个朋友脚边晒太阳。这时那边来了一个乡下人，他以前是个猎手，至今还养着几只猎犬，现在就有一只带在身边。</p>
<p>3．接近小鹿趴着的地方时，猎犬突然停了下来。小鹿看到它，很快站了起来。小鹿有一半的时间都和村里的狗待在一起，显然已经不怕它们了，但现在它仿佛知道敌人就在靠近。突然之间，小鹿的性格似乎全变了，它忘记了过去的一切习性，身上的野性都被唤醒了。它抬起头，鼻孔变大，双眼放光。</p>
<p>4．转瞬之间，谁都没有想到可能的危险，出乎大家的意料，小鹿已经沿着大街跳跃着跑了，猎犬在后面紧追不舍。人们想要营救它，几个人立刻跟了上去。一直以来抚育和喂养小鹿的朋友呼唤它的名字，可是它一点反应都没有。</p>
<p>5．猎人吹口哨想叫回猎犬，可是没叫回来。半分钟后，小鹿就已经拐过第一个街角，冲到湖边，跃入水中。但是，如果开始这受惊的小家伙觉得自己在凉爽的湖水中央就安全了话，它很快就醒悟了，因为猎犬紧紧尾随着，十几只村里的狗也盲目跟着追赶。</p>
<p>6．一大群人聚集在岸边——男人、女人、孩子们——大家都为他们熟悉的小鹿的命运担心。有些人跳到船上，试图在猎狗追上小鹿之前阻拦它。船桨摇动水花四溅，男人、女人、孩子们急切地呼喊着，猎狗和村狗汪汪叫着，这一切让可怜的小鹿又害怕又惊恐——仿佛这片土地上曾经爱抚它、喜爱它的所有生命，突然之间都成了它的死敌。</p>
<p>7．很快人们看到小鹿横穿河湾，向最近的森林方向跑去。猎犬的主人迅速过了桥，全速冲过去，想在他的猎犬上岸的时候拦住它。小鹿继续向前游，使出了平生的所有力气。水面上几乎看不见它小小的头，但所过之处在水面留下痕迹，向它的朋友和敌人暴露了踪迹。</p>
<p>8．小鹿接近地面的时候，人们变得特别紧张。猎人已经在湖的另一边，生气地大声呼喊他的猎犬，但猎犬在这无情的追逐中仿佛已经忘记了主人的声音。小鹿上了岸。轻轻一跃，它已经跳过狭窄的河滩，马上就到了树林的边缘。</p>
<p>9．猎犬紧紧跟着小鹿的气味，朝着河岸上的小鹿追去。它的主人急着要拦住它，全力奔跑着，在这关键时刻追到了。猎犬会听从它的主人吗？或者猎人能不能赶上去及时抓住并控制它？河岸上突然大叫一声，原来小鹿已经冲进森林里不见了踪影。与此同时，猎犬一上岸就被主人强有力的手臂抓住了脖子。最可怕的事情终于没有发生。小鹿顺着山坡向上跑，它的敌人已经被制服了。其他的狗，看见它们的头目被制服了，也都乖乖的了。</p>
<p>10．一些人分头到树林里去找这只小鹿，但都没找到。他们回到村里，汇报说没有发现小鹿。有些人觉得等小鹿不再害怕，它就会自己回来的。小鹿的脖子上戴有刻着主人名字的项圈，和在树林里的其他鹿相比，非常容易识别。</p>
<p>11．没过多久，一个猎人出现在曾经驯养小鹿的女士面前，向她出示了一个刻有名字的项圈。他说，早上打猎，看见远处有一只鹿。他以为这个小家伙会跑走，没想到却朝着他走来，他瞄准、射击，打穿了它的心脏。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-64-annies-dream">LESSON 64 ANNIE’S DREAM</h2>
<p>安妮的梦</p>
<p>1．It was a clear, cold, winter evening, and all the Sinclairs but
Annie had gone out for a neighborly visit. She had resolved to stay at
home and study a long, difficult lesson in Natural (1) Philosophy.</p>
<p>2．Left to herself, the evening passed quickly, but the lesson was
learned a full half hour before the time set for the family to come
home.</p>
<p>3．Closing her book, she leaned back in the soft armchair in which
she was sitting, soon fell asleep, and began to dream. She dreamed that
it was a very cold morning, and that she was standing by the dining-room
stove, looking into the glass basin which was every day filled with
water for evaporation (2) .</p>
<p>4．“Oh, dear,” she sighed, “it is nearly school time. I don’t want to
go out in the cold this morning. Then there is that long lesson. I
wonder if I can say it. Let me see—it takes two hundred and twelve
degrees (3) of heat, I believe, for water to evaporate—”</p>
<p>5．“Nonsense!” “Ridiculous!” shouted a chorus of strange little
voices near by; “Look here! is this water boiling? What an idea; two
hundred and twelve degrees before we can fly, ha, ha!”</p>
<p>6．“Who are you?” asked Annie, in amazement. “Where must I look?” “In
the basin, of course.”</p>
<p>7．Annie looked, and saw a multitude of tiny forms moving swiftly
around, their numbers increasing as the heat of the fire increased. “Why
you dear little things!” said she, “what are you doing down there?”</p>
<p>8．“We are water sprites (4) ,” answered one, in the clearest voice
that can be imagined, “and when this delightful warmth comes all about
us, we become so light that we fly off, as you see.”</p>
<p>9．In another moment he had joined a crowd of his companions that
were spreading their wings and flying off in curling, white clouds over
Annie’s head. But they were so light and thin that they soon disappeared
in the air.</p>
<p>10．She could not see where they went, so she again turned to the
basin. “Doesn’t it hurt you,” she asked one, “to be heated—?” “Not
always to two hundred and twelve,” said the sprite, mischievously (5)
.</p>
<p>11．“No, no,” replied Annie, half-vexed; “I remember, that is boiling
point—but I mean, to be heated as you all are, and then to fly off in
the cold?”</p>
<p>12．“Oh, no,” laughed the little sprite; “we like it. We are made to
change by God’s wise laws, and so it can’t hurt us. We are all the time
at work, in our way, taking different shapes. It is good for us. If you
will go to the window, you will find some of my brothers and sisters on
the glass.”</p>
<p>13．Annie went to the window, and at first could see nothing but some
beautiful frostwork on it. Soon, however, the panes seemed to swarm (6)
with little folks. Their wings were as white as snow, and sparkled with
ice jewels.</p>
<p>14．“Oh,” cried Annie, “this is the prettiest sight I ever saw. What
is your name, darling?” she asked one that wore a crown of snow roses.
The little voice that replied was so sharp and fine that Annie thought
it seemed like a needle point of sound, and she began to laugh.</p>
<p>15．“Fine Frost is our family name,” it said. “I have a first name of
my own, but I shall not tell you what it is, for you are so impolite as
to laugh at me.”</p>
<p>16．“I beg your pardon, dear,” said Annie; “I could not help it. I
will not laugh at you any more if you will tell me how you came here. I
have been talking with one of your brothers over there in the
basin.”</p>
<p>17．The little sprite then folded her wings in a dignified manner,
and said, “I will tell you all I know about it, since you promise to be
polite. It is a very short story, however.”</p>
<p>18．“Last evening we all escaped (7) from the glass basin, as you
have seen our companions do this morning. Oh, how light and free we
felt! But we were so very delicate and thin that no one saw us as we
flew about in the air of the room.”</p>
<p>19．“After a while I flew with these others to this window, and, as
we alighted on the glass, the cold changed us from water sprites into
sprites of the Fine Frost family.” “It is very wonderful,” said Annie.
“Is it nice to be a sprite?”</p>
<p>20．“Oh, yes, we are very gay. All last night we had a fine time
sparkling in the moonlight. I wore a long wreath full of ice pearls and
diamonds. Here is a piece of it. Before long we shall be water sprites
again. I see the sun is coming this way.”</p>
<p>21．“Shall you dread to be melted?” inquired Annie. “No, indeed,”
answered the sprite. “I like to change my form now and then.”</p>
<p>22．A thought flashed across Annie’s brain. What if she should
breathe on the frost and not wait for the sun to melt it. In a moment
more she had done so. Down fell a great number of the tiny mountains and
castles, carrying with them a multitude of frost sprites, and all that
could be seen was a drop of water on the window sill.</p>
<p>23．“Oh, dear! have I hurt them?” she exclaimed. “No, no,” replied a
chorus of many small voices from the drop of water, “we are only water
sprites again. Nothing hurts us; we merely change.” “But you are always
pretty little things,” said Annie. “I wish—”</p>
<p>24．Here a ring at the doorbell woke Annie. She started up to find
the family had returned from their visit, which all declared was a
delightful one. But Annie said she did not believe they had enjoyed
their visit better than she had her half hour’s dream.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-304">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．这是个清澈寒冷的冬日夜晚，除了安妮，辛克莱一家都到邻居家串门了。安妮决心要待在家里，学习一节又长又难的自然课。</p>
<p>2．一个人留在家里，夜晚过得非常快，课程已经学完了，可是离家里人说好的回来时间还有整整半个小时。</p>
<p>3．合上书，她向后靠在自己坐着的软软的扶手椅上，很快就睡着了，还开始做起了梦。她梦见一个寒冷的早晨，她站在餐厅的炉火旁，向玻璃水盆里看，这个水盆每天都盛满水，蒸发的水汽能让屋里空气潮湿些。</p>
<p>4．“哦，天哪，马上该去上学，”安妮叹了口气，“我可不想在这么冷的天出门。还要上那么长的一节课。我想知道，自己是否能说上来所学的东西。我知道需要达到212华氏度（100摄氏度）时，水才会蒸发，我觉得是这样。”</p>
<p>5．“不对！”“胡说！”旁边有叽叽喳喳微小的声音在说话。“你朝这儿看！这水烧开了吗？想什么呢，212华氏度，我们就能飞了。哈哈！”</p>
<p>6．“你们是谁啊？”安妮惊讶地问，“我朝哪儿看？”“当然是水盆里！”</p>
<p>7．安妮向水盆里望去，看见许多小东西很快地移动着，火的温度升高，这些小东西的数量也越来越多。“怎么回事？你们这些可爱的小家伙，”她说，“你们在那儿干什么啊？”</p>
<p>8．“我们是水精灵，”其中一个用你能想象的最清亮的声音说，“这可爱的温暖包围我们的时候，我们就轻得飞走了。你看见了吧。”</p>
<p>9．转瞬间，这个小家伙就加入了它的其他同伴中，它们张开翅膀，在缭绕的白色烟雾中飞过安妮的头上。它们那么轻，那么薄，很快就消失在空气中了。</p>
<p>10．安妮看不到它们去了哪儿，所以她又回头对着水盆，问其中一个说：“你们不疼吗？加热到这样？”“不是总要加热到212华氏度。”水精灵淘气地说。</p>
<p>11．安妮有点生气：“不是不是，我记得水的沸点是这个，我的意思是，你们加热到现在这个程度，然后飞到冷冷的空气里。”</p>
<p>12．“哦，一点儿也不疼，”小小的水精灵笑着说，“我们喜欢这样。按照自然的法则，我们本来就是要改变形状的，所以一点儿也不疼。我们总是在以我们的方式工作着，不停变换形态。这对我们是好事。你到窗户那儿看看，就会发现我的兄弟姐妹在玻璃上呢。”</p>
<p>13．安妮走到窗户边，开始什么也看不见，只是看见了一些漂亮的霜花。很快，窗玻璃上好像挤满了小家伙。它们的翅膀像雪一样白，像冰宝石一样闪闪发光。</p>
<p>14．安妮大叫：“哇，这是我见过的最美的景象。你叫什么名字啊，亲爱的？”她问其中一个带着雪玫瑰皇冠的家伙。回答她的声音又尖又细，安妮觉得像是针尖的声音，忍不住笑了。</p>
<p>15．它说：“霜是我们的姓，我自己有名字，但我不想告诉你，因为你很没礼貌，刚才嘲笑我了。”</p>
<p>16．“对不起，”安妮说，“我没忍住。我再也不笑你了。你能告诉我你是从哪儿来的吗？我刚才和那边水盆里你的一个兄弟说话来着。”</p>
<p>17．小精灵很高贵地把翅膀收起来，说：“既然你保证你会有礼貌，我就告诉你我知道的一切吧，不过这个故事很短。”</p>
<p>18．“昨天晚上我们从玻璃水盆里逃了出来，就像今天早上你看见的我的伙伴那样。噢，我们觉得非常轻松和自由！但是，我们又轻又小，在房间的空气里飞翔的时候，没人看见我们。”</p>
<p>19．“飞了一会儿，我和其他人一起飞到了这个窗户上，一落在窗户上，寒冷就把我们从水精灵变成了霜家族的精灵。”“这么奇妙啊！”安妮说，“当精灵好玩吗？”</p>
<p>20．“噢，那当然啦！我们特别开心。昨天晚上，我们整晚都在月光下闪耀呢。我带着一个用冰珍珠和冰钻石做成的项链。看，这是其中的一块。过一会儿我们就又变成水精灵了。我看见太阳从这边出来了。”</p>
<p>21．“你害怕融化吗？”安妮问它。“不，一点也不怕，”小精灵回答，“我喜欢时不时地变换形态。”</p>
<p>22．安妮的脑海中闪过一个想法。如果不等太阳融化它们，她对着霜花吹口气会怎样呢。没多想她就吹了口气。大量微小的山脉和城堡坍塌了，上面是许许多多的霜精灵，窗玻璃上只看到一滴水。</p>
<p>23．“噢，亲爱的，我伤害它们了吗？”她惊叫道。“没有没有，”水滴中许多微小的声音一起说，“我们只是又变成了水精灵。没什么能够伤害我们。我们只是改变了形态。”“但是，你们总是漂亮的小家伙，”安妮说，“我希望……”</p>
<p>24．这时，门铃声惊醒了安妮。她站起来发现家人们已经从邻居家回来了，每人都很开心。但是，安妮说她不信他们玩得比她那半小时的美梦更快乐。</p>

<p>我遇见的鬼</p>
<p>By Mrs. S. M. B. Piatt, who was born near Lexington, Ky., in
1836．Among her published works may be mentioned “The Nests at
Washington, and Other Poems,” and “A Woman’s Poems.”</p>
<p>1．Yes, Katie, I think you are very sweet,</p>
<p>Now that the tangles are out of your hair,</p>
<p>And you sing as well as the birds you meet,</p>
<p>That are playing, like you, in the blossoms there.</p>
<p>But now you are coming to kiss me, you say:</p>
<p>Well, what is it for? Shall I tie your shoe?</p>
<p>Or loop up your sleeve in a prettier way?</p>
<p>“Do I know about ghosts?” Indeed I do.</p>
<p>2．“Have I seen one?” Yes; last evening, you know,</p>
<p>We were taking a walk that you had to miss,</p>
<p>(I think you were naughty, and cried to go,</p>
<p>But, surely, you’ll stay at home after this!)</p>
<p>And, away in the twilight, lonesomely,</p>
<p>(“What is the twilight?” It’s—getting late!)</p>
<p>I was thinking of things that were sad to me!—</p>
<p>There, hush! you know nothing about them, Kate.</p>
<p>3．Well, we had to go through the rocky lane,</p>
<p>Close to that bridge where the water roars,</p>
<p>By a still, red house, where the dark and rain</p>
<p>Go in when they will at the open doors.</p>
<p>And the moon, that had just waked up, looked through</p>
<p>The broken old windows, and seemed afraid,</p>
<p>And the wild bats flew, and the thistles grew</p>
<p>Where once in the roses the children played.</p>
<p>4．Just across the road by the cherry trees</p>
<p>Some fallen white stones had been lying so long,</p>
<p>Half hid in the grass, and under these</p>
<p>There were people dead. I could hear the song</p>
<p>Of a very sleepy dove as I passed</p>
<p>The graveyard near, and the cricket that cried;</p>
<p>And I look’d (ah! the Ghost is coming at last!)</p>
<p>And something was walking at my side.</p>
<p>5．It seemed to be wrapped in a great dark shawl</p>
<p>(For the night was a little cold, you know,);</p>
<p>It would not speak. It was black and tall;</p>
<p>And it walked so proudly and very slow.</p>
<p>Then it mocked me everything I could do:</p>
<p>Now it caught at the lightning flies like me;</p>
<p>Now it stopped where the elder blossoms grew;</p>
<p>Now it tore the thorns from a gray bent tree.</p>
<p>6．Still it followed me under the yellow moon,</p>
<p>Looking back to the graveyard now and then,</p>
<p>Where the winds were playing the night a tune—</p>
<p>But, Kate, a Ghost doesn’t care for men,</p>
<p>And your papa couldn’t have done it harm.</p>
<p>Ah! dark-eyed darling, what is it you see?</p>
<p>There, you needn’t hide in your dimpled arm—</p>
<p>It was only my shadow that walk’d with me!</p>

皮亚特夫人，1836年出生于肯塔基州莱克星顿附近。她发表的作品包括《华盛顿的巢及其他诗歌》和《一个女人的诗》。</p>
<p>1．是的，凯蒂，我觉得你很可爱，</p>
<p>头发也不乱了，</p>
<p>你像鸟儿一样歌唱，</p>
<p>鸟儿们像你一样，在花丛嬉戏，</p>
<p>但你现在过来亲亲我，你说：</p>
<p>怎么了？是要我帮你系鞋带吗？</p>
<p>还是把你的袖子挽得好看些？</p>
<p>“我知道鬼吗？”我当然知道。</p>
<p>2．“我见过鬼吗？”是的，就在昨晚，</p>
<p>我们出门散步，你没去。</p>
<p>（我觉得你太淘气，哭着非要去，</p>
<p>不过，我保证，这之后你会甘愿待在家里！）</p>
<p>在阴暗的暮色里，孤独寂寥，</p>
<p>（“什么是暮色？”就是天黑的时候！）</p>
<p>我正想着让我伤心的事情，</p>
<p>听，你不懂那是什么，凯蒂。</p>
<p>3．我们要走过小石路，</p>
<p>紧挨着河水咆哮的小桥，</p>
<p>旁边是一所安静的红房子，大门敞开着，</p>
<p>雨水落进去，黑暗钻进去。</p>
<p>月亮刚刚醒来，照着</p>
<p>破损的旧窗户，仿佛害怕了。</p>
<p>野蝙蝠飞来飞去，蓟草也在这里生长，</p>
<p>而这里曾经是玫瑰花丛，孩子们在花间玩耍。</p>
<p>4．穿过小路，在樱桃树边，</p>
<p>一些白色的石碑已经安放很久，</p>
<p>半掩在草丛里的石碑下，</p>
<p>安息着死去的人。</p>
<p>经过坟墓时，我能听到</p>
<p>一只疲倦的鸽子歌唱，蟋蟀也在悉悉作响。</p>
<p>我一看（啊，鬼终于来了。）</p>
<p>好像有什么走在我身边。</p>
<p>5．它裹着黑色斗篷，</p>
<p>（因为夜里有点凉，你知道的）</p>
<p>它什么也不说，又黑又高。</p>
<p>它自大又缓慢地走着。</p>
<p>然后模仿我做的一切：</p>
<p>一会儿它像我一样抓萤火虫，</p>
<p>一会儿它又停在花丛间，</p>
<p>一会儿它又去折弯曲的灰色树枝。</p>
<p>6．在黄色的月光下，它一直跟着我，</p>
<p>时不时向后看看墓园，</p>
<p>那里晚风呼啸，仿佛吹着什么曲调——</p>
<p>但是，凯蒂，鬼才不在乎人什么呢。</p>
<p>你的爸爸也没有伤害过它。</p>
<p>啊，黑眼睛的小可爱啊，你觉得这是什么？</p>
<p>来，不要把头埋在我的胳肢窝里，</p>
<p>跟着我走的只是我自己的影子！</p>
<h2 id="lesson-66-the-elephant">LESSON 66 THE ELEPHANT</h2>
<p>大象</p>
<p>1．The elephant is the largest of quadrupeds (1) ; his height is from
eight to fourteen feet, and his length, from ten to fifteen feet. His
form is that of a hog; his eyes are small and lively; his ears are long,
broad and pendulous (2) . He has two large tusks, which form the ivory
of commerce (3) , and a trunk, or proboscis (4) , at the end of the
nose, which he uses to take his food with, and for attack or defense.
His color is a dark ash-brown.</p>
<p>2．Elephants often assemble in large troops; and, as they march in
search of food, the forests seem to tremble under them. They eat the
branches of trees, together with roots, herbs, leaves, grain, and fruit,
but will not touch fish nor flesh. In a state of nature, they are
peaceable, mild, and brave; exerting their power only for their own
protection or in defense of their own species.</p>
<p>3．Elephants are found both in Asia and Africa, but they are of
different species, the Asiatic elephant having five toes, and the
African, three. These animals are caught by stratagem (5) , and, when
tamed, they are the most gentle, obedient, and patient, as well as the
most docile (6) and sagacious of all quadrupeds. They are used to carry
burdens, and for traveling. Their attachment to their masters is
remarkable; and they seem to live but to serve and obey them. They
always kneel to receive their riders; or the loads they have to
carry.</p>
<p>4．The anecdotes illustrating the character of the elephant are
numerous. An elephant which was kept for exhibition at London, was often
required, as is usual in such exhibitions, to pick up with his trunk a
piece of money thrown upon the floor for this purpose. On one occasion a
sixpence was thrown, which happened to roll a little out of his reach,
not far from the wall. Being desired to pick it up, he stretched out his
proboscis several times to reach it; failing in this, he stood
motionless a few seconds, evidently considering how to act.</p>
<p>5．He then stretched his proboscis in a straight line as far as he
could, a little distance above the coin, and blew with great force
against the wall. The angle produced by the opposition of the wall, made
the current of air act under the coin, as he evidently supposed it
would, and it was curious to observe the sixpence traveling toward the
animal till it came within his reach, when he picked it up.</p>
<p>6．A soldier in India, who had frequently carried an elephant some
arrack (7) , being one day intoxicated, and seeing himself pursued by
the guard whose orders were to conduct him to prison, took refuge under
the elephant. The guard soon finding his retreat, attempted in vain to
take him from his asylum (8) ; for the elephant vigorously defended him
with his trunk.</p>
<p>7．As soon as the soldier became sober, and saw himself placed under
such an unwieldy (9) animal, he was so terrified that he scarcely durst
move either hand or foot; but the elephant soon caused his fears to
subside by caressing him with his trunk, and thus tacitly (10) saying,
“Depart in peace.”</p>
<p>8．A pleasing anecdote is related of an elephant which was the
property of the nabob (11) of Lucknow. There was in that city an
epidemic (12) disorder, making dreadful havoc among the inhabitants. The
road to the palace gate was covered with the sick and dying, lying on
the ground at the moment the nabob was about to pass.</p>
<p>9．Regardless of the suffering he must cause, the nabob held on his
way, not caring whether his beast trod upon the poor helpless creatures
or not. But the animal, more kind-hearted than his master, carefully
cleared the path of the poor, helpless wretches as he went along. Some
he lifted with his trunk, entirely out of the road. Some he set upon
their feet, and among the others he stepped so carefully that not an
individual was injured.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-306">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．大象是四蹄动物中体型最大的：高达八到十英尺，长达十到十五英尺。大象的外形和猪有点像：眼睛很小，但很有活力，耳朵又长又宽，向下耷拉着。大象有两颗大牙，因此也产生了象牙贸易。象的鼻子很长，可以用来拿食物，也可以攻击或是防卫。大象的颜色是深灰褐色的。</p>
<p>2．大象常常聚集成一大群，在它们集体找食的时候，似乎森林都在它们脚下颤抖。它们吃树枝，也吃树根、野草、树叶、谷物和水果，但不吃鱼和肉。自然状态下，大象爱和平、性格温和，也很勇敢，只有在保护自己或是同类的时候才会施展自己的力量。</p>
<p>3．尽管在亚洲和非洲都有大象，但它们的种类不同。亚洲象有五个脚趾，非洲象只有三个脚趾头。捕捉大象需要使些计谋，一旦驯服了，它们非常温和、顺从，富有耐心，是所有四蹄动物中最听话、最聪明的。大象可以用来驮重物和骑行。它们对主人的感情非常深厚，仿佛它们生来就是为主人服务、顺从主人的。它们总是跪下来等待装载重物，或者等人骑上去。</p>
<p>4．描述大象性格的故事不计其数。以前在伦敦养了一只大象，用来展览，在这样的展览里，它经常被要求用鼻子捡起扔在地上的钱。一天有人扔了六便士，碰巧滚到离墙很近的地方，它正好够不到。它很想把钱捡起来，所以几次伸出长鼻子去够，几次都失败了。它一动不动站了几秒钟，显然是在想该怎么办。</p>
<p>5．大象把鼻子尽可能地伸直，伸到离硬币有点距离的上方，随后它使劲对着墙吹了一口气。吹出的气受到墙的阻挡，在硬币下面发了力，就像它计算好的一样。人们惊讶地发现硬币向着大象移动了，移到了它可以够到的地方，然后大象把硬币捡了起来。</p>
<p>6．印度有名士兵经常用一头大象运烧酒，一天这士兵喝醉了，一旦他被护卫抓住，就会被关进监狱了。他藏到了大象身下，护卫虽然很快发现他的藏身之地，但没法把他从这里弄出来，因为大象用长鼻子勇敢地保护着他。</p>
<p>7．士兵清醒之后，发现自己藏在这个庞然大物身下，他吓坏了，手脚都不敢动一下。可是大象很快打消了他的恐惧，它用长鼻子抚摸着他，仿佛在说：安心离开吧！</p>
<p>8．还有一个人们喜闻乐见的故事。一位印度王子有一头不同寻常的大象。当时那个城市正闹瘟疫，给当地居民带来严重的损失。当王子经过宫殿大门的时候，道路上躺着的满是病人和垂死的人。</p>
<p>9．王子骑着象继续赶路，丝毫不顾及是否会踩到人，也不管会带来多大痛苦。但是，这头大象比他的主人要善良得多，一边走，一边小心地避开路上的可怜的人、受伤的人。它用鼻子把一些人挪到路边，它还让一些人站了起来。它小心翼翼地走在余下的人中间，没让任何人受伤。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-67-dare-to-do-right">LESSON 67 DARE TO DO RIGHT</h2>
<p>勇于做正确的事</p>
<p>Adapted from “School Days at Rugby,” by Thomas Hughes, an English
writer well known through this book, and its sequel, “Tom Brown at
Oxford.” The author was born in 1823, and died in 1896.</p>
<p>1．The little schoolboys went quietly to their own beds, and began
undressing and talking to one another in whispers: while the elder,
amongst whom was Tom, sat chatting about on one another’s beds, with
their jackets and waistcoats (1) off.</p>
<p>2．Poor little Arthur was overwhelmed (2) with the novelty (3) of his
position. The idea of sleeping in the room with strange boys had clearly
never crossed his mind before, and was as painful as it was strange to
him. He could hardly bear to take his jacket off; however, presently,
with an effort, off it came, and then he paused and looked at Tom, who
was sitting at the bottom of his bed, talking and laughing.</p>
<p>3．“Please, Brown,” he whispered, “may I wash my face and hands?” “Of
course, if you like,” said Tom, staring: “that’s your wash-hand stand
under the window, second from your bed. You’ll have to go down for more
water in the morning if you use it all.”</p>
<p>4．And on he went with his talk, while Arthur stole timidly from
between the beds out to his wash-hand stand, and began his ablutions (4)
, thereby drawing for a moment on himself the attention of the room.</p>
<p>5．On went the talk and laughter. Arthur finished his washing and
undressing, and put on his nightgown. He then looked round more
nervously than ever. Two or three of the little boys were already in
bed, sitting up with their chins on their knees. The light burned clear,
the noise went on.</p>
<p>6．It was a trying moment for the poor, little, lonely boy; however,
this time he did not ask Tom what he might or might not do, but dropped
all his knees by his bedside, as he had done every day from his
childhood, to open his heart to Him who heareth the cry and beareth the
sorrows of the tender child, and the strong man in agony.</p>
<p>7．Tom was sitting at the bottom of his bed unlacing his boots, so
that his back was towards Arthur, and he did not see what had happened,
and looked up in wonder at the sudden silence. Then two or three boys
laughed and sneered (5) , and a big, brutal fellow, who was standing in
the middle of the room, picked up a slipper and shied it at the kneeling
boy, calling him a sniveling young shaver.</p>
<p>8．Then Tom saw the whole, and the next moment the boot he had just
pulled off flew straight at the head of the bully (6) , who had just
time to throw up his arm and catch it on his elbow. “Confound you,
Brown; what’s that for?” roared he, stamping with pain. “Never mind what
I mean,” said Tom, stepping on to the floor, every drop of blood in his
body tingling (7) : “if any fellow wants the other boot, he knows how to
get it.”</p>
<p>9．What would have been the result is doubtful, for at this moment
the sixth-form boy (8) came in, and not another word could be said. Tom
and the rest rushed into bed and finished their unrobing there, and the
old janitor had put out the candle in another minute, and toddled on to
the next room, shutting the door with his usual, “Good night,
gen’l’m’n.”</p>
<p>10．There were many boys in the room by whom that little scene was
taken to heart before they slept. But sleep seemed to have deserted the
pillow of poor Tom. For some time his excitement and the flood of
memories which chased one another though his brain, kept him from
thinking or resolving. His head throbbed, his heart leapt, and he could
hardly keep himself from springing out of bed and rushing about the
room.</p>
<p>11．Then the thought of his own mother came across him, and the
promise he had made at her knee, years ago, never to forget to kneel by
his bedside and give himself up to his Father before he laid his head on
the pillow, from which it might never rise; and he lay down gently, and
cried as if his heart would break. He was only fourteen years old.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What were Arthur’s feelings the first night at Rugby?
Relate what happened when he said his prayers. What do you think of the
boy who threw the slipper? Was Tom right in defending Arthur from
insult?</p>

<p>本文节选自《在拉格比学校的日子》，作者托马斯·休斯，以本书及其续集《汤姆·布朗在牛津》而闻名。作者生于1823年，于1896年逝世。</p>
<p>1．学校里，小男孩们悄悄地爬上床，脱掉衣服，开始说起了悄悄话，大一点的孩子们，包括汤姆·布朗，互相坐在床上聊起天来，他们也已经脱了外套和马甲。</p>
<p>2．可怜的小阿瑟初来乍到，觉得有点不适应。和陌生的男孩子们在同一个屋子里睡觉，他以前可从来没有想过，这让他觉得又奇怪，又痛苦。他很难忍受脱掉外衣，不过，很快，一咬牙，他还是脱了下来，然后他停下来看着汤姆，这时汤姆正坐在自己的床头，有说有笑的。</p>
<p>3．“请问，布朗，”他小声说，“我可以洗洗手和脸吗？”“当然可以，如果你愿意的话，”汤姆盯着他说，“你的脸盆架在那边窗子下面，从你的床数第二个。如果你把水都用了，早晨你得下去再打些过来。”</p>
<p>4．汤姆继续和别人说话，而阿瑟轻手轻脚地从床之间来到自己的脸盆架旁开始洗脸，也把房间的注意力暂时吸引到了他身上。</p>
<p>5．他们继续说笑着，阿瑟洗漱完之后脱下衣服，换上了他的睡衣。他紧张地看了一圈。两三个小男孩已经坐在床上，下巴放在膝盖上。灯光明亮，房间里的噪音继续着。</p>
<p>6．对可怜的小阿瑟来说，这是一个考验他的时刻，不过这次他没有问汤姆他能不能做，而是直接在他的床边跪了下来，就像他从孩提起每天做的那样，他向聆听世人请求、为弱小的孩子和成年人承受苦恼和痛苦的主敞开了他的心。</p>
<p>7．汤姆正坐在床边解鞋带，背对着阿瑟，所以他没看到发生了什么，只是感觉突然安静下来，他便惊讶地抬起头来。这时，两三个男孩大笑起来，讥讽小阿瑟，一个高大鲁莽的家伙站在房间中央，拿起一只拖鞋，扔向跪着的阿瑟，把他叫作哭哭啼啼的小家伙。</p>
<p>8．汤姆看到了发生的一切，刚脱下的鞋子笔直地飞向那个恶棍的头，那个家伙抬起胳膊，正好用胳膊肘挡住了。“疯了吧，布朗，你在干什么？”他大叫起来，疼得直跺脚。“不用管我是什么意思，”汤姆站在地上，身体里的每一滴血液都在燃烧，“有谁想要另一只靴子，他知道该怎么做。”</p>
<p>9．接下来可能发生什么没人知道，因为这时，六年级的值周生过来了，大家都不作声了。汤姆和其他男孩赶忙冲到床上，脱了衣服。随后宿舍老师把蜡烛熄灭，像往常一样关上门，说：“晚安，先生们。”</p>
<p>10．刚才发生的一幕让宿舍里的很多男孩在心里思量起来。汤姆怎么都睡不着。刚才发生的事情让他非常激动，大脑里涌动的记忆和刚才的一幕互相追逐，让他无法思考和分析。他头疼得厉害，心怦怦地跳，差点忍不住从床上跳起来绕着房间跑几圈。</p>
<p>11．然后，他想到了自己母亲，几年前，他在母亲的膝前保证，说自己每天晚上躺下之前，一定不会忘记跪在床边，把自己交给上帝，因为可能一觉之后就再也不会醒来了。他轻轻躺下，哭得仿佛心都碎了。他才只是个十四岁的孩子啊。</p>

RIGHT（CONCLUDED）</h2>
<p>勇于做正确的事（结束篇）</p>
<p>1．It was no light act of courage in those days for a little fellow
to say his prayers publicly, even at Rugby. A few years later, when
Arnold’s manly piety had begun to leaven (1) the school, the tables
turned: before he died, in the Schoolhouse at least, and I believe in
the other houses, the rule was the other way.</p>
<p>2．But poor Tom had come to school in other times. The first few
nights after he came he did not kneel down because of the noise, but sat
up in bed till the candle was out, and then stole out and said his
prayers, in fear lest some one should find him out. So did many another
poor little fellow.</p>
<p>3．Then he began to think that he might just as well say his prayers
in bed, and then that it did not matter whether he was kneeling, or
sitting, or lying down. And so it had come to pass with Tom, as with all
who will not confess their Lord before men; and for the last year he had
probably not said his prayers in earnest a dozen times.</p>
<p>4．Poor Tom! the first and bitterest feeling, which was like to break
his heart, was the sense of his own cowardice. The vice of all others
which he loathed (2) was brought in and burned in on his own soul. He
had lied to his mother, to his conscience, to his God. How could he bear
it? And then the poor, little, weak boy, whom he had pitied and almost
scorned for his weakness, had done that which he, braggart (3) as he
was, dared not do.</p>
<p>5．The first dawn of comfort came to him in vowing (4) to himself
that he would stand by that boy through thick and thin, and cheer him,
and help him, and bear his burdens, for the good deed done that night.
Then he resolved to write home next day and tell his mother all, and
what a coward her son had been. And then peace came to him as he
resolved, lastly, to bear his testimony (5) next morning.</p>
<p>6．The morning would be harder than the night to begin with, but he
felt that he could not afford to let one chance slip. Several times he
faltered (6) , for the Devil showed him, first, all his old friends
calling him “Saint,” and “Squaretoes” and a dozen hard names, and
whispered to him that his motives (7) would be misunderstood, and he
would be left alone with the new boy; whereas, it was his duty to keep
all means of influence, that he might do good to the largest number.</p>
<p>7．And then came the more subtle (8) temptation, “shall I not be
showing myself braver than others by doing this? Have I any right to
begin it now? Ought I not rather to pray in my own study (9) , letting
other boys know that I do so, and trying to lead them to it, while in
public, at least, I should go on as I have done?” However, his good
angel was too strong that night, and he turned on his side and slept,
tired of trying to reason, but resolved to follow the impulse which had
been so strong, and in which he had found peace.</p>
<p>8．Next morning he was up and washed and dressed, all but his jacket
and waistcoat, just as the ten minutes’ bell began to ring, and then in
the face of the whole room he knelt down to pray. Not five words could
he say,—the bell mocked him; he was listening for every whisper in the
room,—what were they all thinking of him?</p>
<p>9．He was ashamed to go on kneeling, ashamed to rise from his knees.
At last, as it were from his inmost heart, a still, small voice seemed
to breathe forth the words of the publican, “God be merciful to me a
sinner!” He repeated them over and over, clinging to them as for his
life, and rose from his knees comforted and humbled, and ready to face
the whole world.</p>
<p>10．It was not needed: two other boys besides Arthur had already
followed his example, and he went down to the great school with a
glimmering (10) of another lesson in his heart,—the lesson that he who
has conquered his own coward spirit has conquered the whole outward
world; and that other one which the old prophet learned in the cave at
Mount Horeb, when he hid his face, and the still, small voice asked,
“What doest thou here, Elijah?”—that however we may fancy ourselves
alone on the side of good, the King and Lord of men is nowhere without
his witnesses; for in every society, however seemingly corrupt and
godless, there are those who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</p>
<p>11．He found, too, how greatly he had exaggerated the effect to be
produced by his act. For a few nights there was a sneer or a laugh when
he knelt down, but this passed off soon, and one by one all the other
boys but three or four followed the lead.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Relate Tom’s early experience at Rugby. Was it courageous
in him to stop saying his prayers? How did he feel over it? What did he
resolve to do? Did he carry out his resolve? What two lessons was he
taught?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-308">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．那个时候，一个小男孩要在公开场合做祷告，这需要不小的勇气，在拉格比学校也是这样。过了几年，阿诺德校长以勇敢和虔诚开始改变这所学校，情况才有所变化。他去世之前，至少拉格比学校的情况不同了，而在其他的学校，我相信还没有什么变化。</p>
<p>2．但是，可怜的汤姆没赶上这样的好时候。刚上学的前几个晚上，他因为大家吵吵闹闹，就没有跪下祷告，而是坐在床上等着蜡烛熄灭之后，悄悄溜出去祷告，他怕让别人发现。很多可怜的小家伙也是如此。</p>
<p>3．后来，他想干脆自己在床上进行祷告，这样他是跪着、坐着，或者躺着也没什么关系。这就是事情的经过，其他不愿在众人面前祷告的人也是一样。最后一年他几乎没有认真祷告过。</p>
<p>4．可怜的汤姆！最强烈也最让他痛苦的就是他的懦弱，几乎要让他的心碎了。他想到了别的令他非常厌恶的罪恶，这让他的灵魂备受煎熬。他对他的母亲说谎了，他对母亲、自己的良心和上帝说了谎。他怎么能忍受呢？但这个可怜、瘦小又柔弱的男孩，这个曾让他感到怜悯，甚至嘲笑的软弱的男孩，居然做了件他只是吹嘘，却没有勇气做的事。</p>
<p>5．他发誓无论如何都要支持那个男孩，鼓励他、帮助他、分担他的困难。晚上他所做的好事，给他带来一点点安慰。然后，他决定第二天给家里写封信，告诉母亲发生的一切，告诉她自己曾经是怎样的一个胆小鬼。他下定决心在第二天一早证明自己，这才让他心里感到宁静了。</p>
<p>6．他想到第二天早晨可能比夜晚还要难度过，但他觉得不能再让这次机会溜走了。他也犹豫了好几次，因为魔鬼不停地影响他：他的老朋友们叫他“圣人”、“古板的家伙”，还有其他难听的外号；魔鬼小声在他耳边低声，说他的动机会被人误解的，最后他会和这个新来的男孩一起被孤立。然而，他决定不管一切的影响，一定要坚持正确的到最后。</p>
<p>7．随后，更微妙的诱惑来了：“我必须要这么做，让他们觉得我在逞强吗？我必须现在开始吗？我是不是应该在我的书房祷告，让其他男孩知道我在这么做，然后试着引导他们，而在公开场合，还是像我原来一样？”但是，那天晚上，正义的天使太强大了，他侧着躺着睡着了，没有再想什么，而是决定遵从他内心强烈的冲动，这样他也觉得心里平静了。</p>
<p>8．第二天一早，他起来梳洗穿戴完毕，只剩外套和马甲没穿，再有十分钟上课铃就要响了，在宿舍所有人眼皮底下，他跪下来祷告。他还没说几个字，铃声就响了起来。他听着屋子里小声说话的声音——他们会怎么想他呢？</p>
<p>9．他不好意思再跪着了，也不好意思站起来。最后，从他内心深处，一个平静、微小的声音说出了那些话：“上帝啊，请饶恕我这个罪人吧！”他一遍又一遍地重复这句话，求生似地紧抓着这句话，这才心安理得地站起来，准备好坦然地面对整个世界。</p>
<p>10．他的担心是多余的：阿瑟和他身边的另外两个男孩已经学着他的样子跪下祷告了，在去教室的路上，他又明白了这样一课——只要战胜了自己内心的怯懦，你就征服了外面的整个世界。他也明白了当以利亚藏身在基立溪旁的山洞里，当时他低下了头，而一个宁静、微小的声音问道：“你在那儿做什么，以利亚？”不论我们在世界上感觉多么孤独，神灵总是看得到的。而在任何一个社会里，无论多么腐败，多么不敬神灵，总有不向邪恶屈服的人。</p>
<p>11．他还发现，他是多么夸大了自己行为的影响。开始几个晚上，当他跪下来的时候，偶尔有人讥讽嘲笑，但很快就听不到了。除了三四个男孩，其他的男孩们一个接一个地跟随他一样祷告了。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-69-the-wreck-of-the-hesperus">LESSON 69 THE WRECK OF THE
HESPERUS</h2>
<p>赫斯珀洛斯号的残骸</p>
<p>By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of the greatest of American poets.
He was born in Portland, Me., in 1807．For some years he held the
professorship of Modern Languages in Bowdoin College, and later a
similar professorship in Harvard College. He died March 24th, 1882.</p>
<p>1．It was the schooner Hesperus,</p>
<p>That sailed the wintry sea;</p>
<p>And the skipper (1) had taken his little daughter,</p>
<p>To bear him company.</p>
<p>2．Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax,</p>
<p>Her checks like the dawn of day,</p>
<p>And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,</p>
<p>That ope in the month of May.</p>
<p>3．The skipper, he stood beside the helm,</p>
<p>His pipe was in his mouth,</p>
<p>And he watched how the veering (2) flaw (3) did blow</p>
<p>The smoke now west, now south.</p>
<p>4．Then up and spake an old sailor,</p>
<p>Had sailed to the Spanish Main (4) ,</p>
<p>“I pray thee, put into yonder port (5) ,</p>
<p>For I fear the hurricane.</p>
<p>5．“Last night, the moon had a golden ring,</p>
<p>And to-night no moon we see!”</p>
<p>The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,</p>
<p>And a scornful laugh laughed he.</p>
<p>6．Colder and louder blew the wind,</p>
<p>A gale from the northeast;</p>
<p>The snow fell hissing in the brine (6) ,</p>
<p>And the billows frothed like yeast.</p>
<p>7．Down came the storm, and smote amain (7)</p>
<p>The vessel in its strength;</p>
<p>She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,</p>
<p>Then leaped her cable’s length.</p>
<p>8．“Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,</p>
<p>And do not tremble so;</p>
<p>For I can weather (8) the roughest gale</p>
<p>That ever wind did blow.”</p>
<p>9．He wrapped her warm in his seaman’s coat,</p>
<p>Against the stinging blast:</p>
<p>He cut a rope from a broken spar (9) ,</p>
<p>And bound her to the mast.</p>
<p>10．“O father! I hear the church bells ring,</p>
<p>Oh say, what may it be?”</p>
<p>“’T is a fog bell on a rock-bound coast!”—</p>
<p>And he steered for the open sea.</p>
<p>11．“O father! I hear the sound of guns,</p>
<p>Oh say, what may it be?”</p>
<p>“Some ship in distress, that can not live</p>
<p>In such an angry sea!”</p>
<p>12．“O father! I see a gleaming light,</p>
<p>Oh say, what may it be?”</p>
<p>But the father answered never a word,</p>
<p>A frozen corpse was he.</p>
<p>13．Lashed to the helm (10) , all stiff and stark,</p>
<p>With his face turned to the skies,</p>
<p>The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow</p>
<p>On his fixed and glassy eyes.</p>
<p>14．Then the maiden clasped her hands, and prayed</p>
<p>That saved she might be;</p>
<p>And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave</p>
<p>On the lake of Galilee.</p>
<p>15．And fast through the midnight dark and drear,</p>
<p>Through the whistling sleet and snow,</p>
<p>Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept</p>
<p>Tow’rds the reef of Norman’s Woe (11) .</p>
<p>16．And ever the fitful gusts between</p>
<p>A sound came from the land:</p>
<p>It was the sound of the trampling surf</p>
<p>On the rocks and the hard sea sand.</p>
<p>17．The breakers were right beneath her bows,</p>
<p>She drifted a dreary wreck,</p>
<p>And a whooping billow swept the crew</p>
<p>Like icicles from her deck.</p>
<p>18．She struck where the white and fleecy waves</p>
<p>Looked soft as carded (12) wool,</p>
<p>But the cruel rocks, they gored her side</p>
<p>Like the horns of an angry bull.</p>
<p>19．Her rattling shrouds (13) , all sheathed in ice,</p>
<p>With the masts, went by the board (14) ;</p>
<p>Like a vessel of glass, she stove (15) and sank,</p>
<p>Ho! ho! the breakers roared!</p>
<p>20．At day break, on the bleak seabeach,</p>
<p>A fisherman stood aghast,</p>
<p>To see the form of a maiden fair</p>
<p>Lashed close to a drifting mast.</p>
<p>21．The salt sea was frozen on her breast,</p>
<p>The salt tears in her eyes;</p>
<p>And he saw her hair, like the brown seaweed,</p>
<p>On the billows fall and rise.</p>
<p>22．Such was the wreck of the Hesperus</p>
<p>In the midnight and the snow:</p>
<p>Heav’n save us all from a death like this</p>
<p>On the reef of Norman’s Woe!</p>

<h2 id="lesson-70-anecdotes-of-birds">LESSON 70 ANECDOTES OF BIRDS</h2>
<p>鸟类趣闻</p>
<p>1．I had once a favorite black hen, “a great beauty,” as she was
called by everyone, and so I thought her; her feathers were so jetty,
and her topping so white and full! She knew my voice as well as any dog,
and used to run cackling and bustling to my hand to receive the
fragments that I never failed to collect from the breakfast table for
“Yarico,” as she was called.</p>
<p>2．Yarico, by the time she was a year old, hatched a respectable
family of chickens; little, cowering, timid things at first, but, in due
time, they became fine chubby ones; and old Norah said, “If I could only
keep Yarico out of the copse (1) , it would do; but the copse is full of
weasels and of foxes.</p>
<p>3．“I have driven her back twenty times; but she watches till some
one goes out of the gate, and then she’s off again. It is always the
case with young hens, Miss; they think they know better than their
keepers; and nothing cures them but losing a brood or two of chickens.”
I have often thought since that young people, as well as young hens, buy
their experience equally dear.</p>
<p>4．One morning; after breakfast, I went to seek my favorite in the
poultry yard; plenty of hens were there, but no Yarico. The gate was
open, and, as I concluded she had sought the forbidden copse, I
proceeded there, accompanied by the yard mastiff; a noble fellow, steady
and sagacious (2) as a judge.</p>
<p>5．At the end of a lane, flanked on one side by a quickset hedge, on
the other by a wild common, what was called the copse commenced; but
before I arrived near the spot I heard a loud and tremendous cackling,
and met two young, long-legged pullets, running with both wings and feet
toward home. Jock pricked up his sharp ears, and would have set off at
full gallop to the copse; but I restrained him, hastening onward,
however, at the top of my speed, thinking I had as good a right to see
what was the matter as Jock.</p>
<p>6．Poor Yarico! An impertinent (3) fox cub had attempted to carry off
one of her children; but she had managed to get them behind her in the
hedge, and venturing boldly forth had placed herself in front, and
positively kept the impudent animal at bay. His desire for plunder had
prevented his noticing our approach, and Jock soon made him feel the
superiority of an English mastiff over a cub fox.</p>
<p>7．The most interesting portion of my tale is to come. Yarico not
only never afterward ventured to the copse, but formed a strong
friendship for the dog which had preserved her family. Whenever he
appeared in the yard, she would run to meet him, prating and clucking
all the time, and impeding his progress by walking between his legs, to
his no small annoyance. If any other dog entered the yard, she would fly
at him most furiously, thinking, perhaps, that he would injure her
chickens; but she evidently considered Jock her especial protector, and
treated him accordingly.</p>
<p>8．It was very droll to see the peculiar look with which he regarded
his feathered friend; not knowing exactly what to make of her
civilities, and doubting how they should be received. When her family
were educated, and able to do without her care, she was a frequent
visitor at Jock’s kennel (4) , and would, if permitted, roost there at
night, instead of returning with the rest of the poultry to the
henhouse. Yarico certainly was a most grateful and interesting bird.</p>
<p>9．One could almost believe a parrot had intellect, when he keeps up
a conversation so spiritedly; and it is certainly singular to observe
how accurately a well-trained bird will apply his knowledge. A friend of
mine knew one that had been taught many sentences; thus, “Sally, Poll
wants her breakfast!” “Sally, Poll wants her tea!” but she never mistook
the one for the other; breakfast was invariably demanded in the morning,
and tea in the afternoon; and she always hailed her master, but no one
else, by “How do you do, Mr. A?”</p>
<p>10．She was a most amusing bird, and could whistle dogs, which she
had great pleasure in doing. She would drop bread out of her cage as she
hung at the street door, and whistle a number about her, and then, just
as they were going to possess themselves of her bounty, utter a shrill
scream of “Get out, dogs!” with such vehemence (5) and authority as
dispersed the assembled company without a morsel, to her infinite
delight.</p>
<p>11．How wonderful is that instinct by which the bird of passage
performs its annual migration (6) ! But how still more wonderful is it
when the bird, after its voyage of thousands of miles has been
performed, and new lands visited, returns to the precise window or eaves
where, the summer before, it first enjoyed existence! And yet, such is
unquestionably the fact.</p>
<p>12．Four brothers had watched with indignation the felonious (7)
attempts of a sparrow to possess himself of the nest of a house martin,
in which lay its young brood of four unfledged birds.</p>
<p>13．The little fellows considered themselves as champions for the
bird which had come over land and sea, and chosen its shelter under
their mother’s roof. They therefore marshaled themselves with blowguns,
to execute summary vengeance; but their well-meant endeavors brought
destruction upon the mud-built domicile (8) they wished to defend. Their
artillery (9) loosened the foundations, and down it came, precipitating
its four little inmates to the ground. The mother of the children, Good
Samaritan-like, replaced the little outcasts in their nest, and set it
in the open window of an unoccupied chamber.</p>
<p>14．The parent birds, after the first terror was over, did not appear
disconcerted (10) by the change of situation, but hourly fed their young
as usual, and testified, by their unwearied twitter of pleasure, the
satisfaction and confidence they felt. There the young birds were duly
fledged, and from that window they began their flight, and entered upon
life.</p>
<p>15．The next spring, with the reappearance of the martins, came four,
which familiarly flew into the chamber, visited all the walls, and
expressed their recognition (11) by the most clamorous twitterings of
joy. They were, without question, the very birds that had been bred
there the preceding year.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-310">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．我曾经有一只最喜爱的黑色大母鸡，人们都叫她“大美人”，我觉得它名副其实。它的羽毛乌黑发亮，头上的羽毛又白又密。它的听觉就像狗一样灵敏，对我的声音非常熟悉，经常会咯咯咯地扑扇着翅膀到我手上啄食，我经常收拾剩下的早饭来喂雅丽克，雅丽克是它的名字。</p>
<p>2．雅丽克一岁的时候，已经孵出了很大一群小鸡，一开始这些小家伙小心翼翼、畏头畏脑的，后来慢慢地，变得圆嘟嘟的，老诺拉说：“我得让雅丽克离小树林远点，这就好了，小树林里都是黄鼠狼和狐狸。”</p>
<p>3．“我都把它赶回来二十次了，但每次一看见有人出门，它就溜出去了。小母鸡们都是这样，小姐，它们总觉得自己比主人知道的多，不丢一两窝小鸡它们可记不住。”此后，我就经常想：年轻人和小母鸡们一样，买个教训要付出昂贵的教训。</p>
<p>4．一天上午，早饭之后，我去鸡场找我最喜欢的这只母鸡，那里有很多只母鸡，但就是没有雅丽克。大门开着，我觉得它肯定去了树林禁地，我朝着那边走去，带着叫乔克的马士提夫犬，这只狗雄赳赳的，非常稳重，目光敏锐，非常聪明。</p>
<p>5．小路一边是简易栅栏，一边是空旷的空地，小路的尽头就是树林边。还没到小树林，我就听到了大声的咯咯叫声，还看见两只小母鸡，伸着长腿，扑腾着翅膀，朝着家里跑。乔克竖起灵敏的耳朵，要不是被我牵着，早就全速冲进树林里去了。我牵着乔克以最快的速度快速往前跑，想要和他一起看看树林里发生了什么。</p>
<p>6．可怜的雅丽克！一只凶恶的小狐狸试图要叼走它的一个孩子，不过它把孩子们护在身后的栅栏里，它自己勇敢地冲了上去，无礼的小狐狸明显地被逼到了死胡同。小狐狸一心要做强盗，没有注意到我们的到来，乔克很快就让这只小狐狸感觉到英国马士提夫犬的优势地位。</p>
<p>7．接下来我要讲到这个故事最有意思的地方了。雅丽克此后不仅再也不敢去小树林，而且还和拯救了它家庭的乔克建立了深厚的友谊。只要乔克出现在鸡场里，它就跑过去找它，咯咯咯地叫个不停，好像在拉家常，还在它腿间走来走去，让乔克走不动路，这令乔克有点恼火。如果其他的狗来鸡场里，它就会愤怒地飞跑过去，可能担心它的孩子受到伤害，但它显然把乔克当作了特殊的保护者，也因此对乔克非常亲热。</p>
<p>8．乔克看到它的长满羽毛的朋友那副奇怪神态觉得很滑稽，也不知该如何对待它的这种热情，觉得不知所措。雅丽克的孩子长大后，不再需要它的庇护了，它就经常到乔克的狗舍做客，有时候就在那儿过夜，而不是和其他的母鸡一样回到鸡场。雅丽克显然是最懂感恩、最有趣的小鸡。</p>
<p>9．看到鹦鹉能够活力四射地与人交谈，人们常常觉得它们是有智力的动物。观察一只受过良好训练的鹦鹉如何运用自己的知识，这显然是件新奇的事。我的一位朋友见过一只会说很多话的鹦鹉，比如“莎莉，波尔要吃早餐！”“莎莉，波尔要喝茶！”这只鹦鹉从来没有弄混过，总是在早晨要早餐，在下午要茶。它还经常和自己的主人打招呼：“您好，A先生。”但她从来不问候其他的人。</p>
<p>10．这是一只非常有意思的鸟，它甚至还可以吹口哨招呼狗，它也很喜欢这么做。人们把鸟笼挂在门口的时候，它会把一块面包掉在地上，然后吹一段口哨，狗闻讯赶来。正在狗要享用面包美餐的时候，它就突然大叫一声：“狗，滚开！”声音里充满力量和权威，狗什么都没吃到就跑开了，这时它就感到特别高兴。</p>
<p>11．候鸟具有每年迁徙的本能，这是多么神奇的事情啊！但是，当鸟儿在飞行了上千里，在经历过新的栖息地之后，鸟儿们还是会回到去年夏天它们最初居住过的窗户或屋檐下，这更是神奇。然而，这是毫无疑问的事实。</p>
<p>12．四个兄弟曾经愤怒地看到一只麻雀试图占领一只家燕的鸟窝，而窝里有四只羽翼未丰的小家燕。</p>
<p>13．四兄弟觉得自己是英雄，因为家燕飞跃重重陆地和海洋，选择了他们家的屋檐来做窝。他们拿起气枪，匆忙向麻雀讨公道，但他们本来好意要维护鸟窝，实际却带来了灾难。他们的武器把鸟窝的根基松动了，鸟窝掉了下来，里面的四只小鸟掉在了地上。四兄弟的妈妈，就像好心的撒玛利亚人一样，把四只小家伙放回窝里，把鸟窝放在一个没住人的房间的窗户上方。</p>
<p>14．短暂的恐慌之后，燕子爸爸和妈妈并没有因为环境改变而不安，而是像往常一样按时喂小燕子，通过它们不时叽叽喳喳的叫声可以知道，它们感觉很满足很安心。就这样，小燕子们在这儿羽翼渐丰，从这个窗户上方开始了人生的旅途。</p>
<p>15．第二年春天，燕子再次出现的时候，四只燕子很熟悉地飞到那个房间的窗口，沿着周边的墙飞来飞去，欢快地喳喳叫着表示它们认出了这个熟悉的地方。毫无疑问，它们就是去年在这儿出生的那四只雏燕。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-71-the-rainbow-pilgrimage">LESSON 71 THE RAINBOW
PILGRIMAGE</h2>
<p>寻找彩虹的旅程</p>
<p>By Sara J. Lippincott, born at Onondaga, N. Y., in 1823, of New
England parentage. Under the name of “Grace Greenwood” she has written
many charming stories for children. Some of her best sketches are in
“Records of Five Years.”</p>
<p>1．One summer afternoon, when I was about eight years of age, I was
standing at an eastern window, looking at a beautiful rainbow that,
bending from the sky, seemed to be losing itself in a thick, swampy wood
about a quarter of a mile distant.</p>
<p>2．It happened that no one was in the room with me then but my
brother Rufus, who was just recovering (1) from a severe illness, and
was sitting, propped up with pillows, in an easy-chair, looking out,
with me, at the rainbow.</p>
<p>3．“See, brother,” I said, “it drops right down among the cedars,
where we go in the spring to find wintergreens (2) !”</p>
<p>4．“Do you know, Gracie,” said my brother, with a very serious face,
“that if you should go to the end of the rain how, you would find there
purses filled with money, and great pots of gold and silver?”</p>
<p>5．“Is it truly so?” I asked.</p>
<p>6．“Truly so,” answered my brother, with a smile. Now, I was a
simple-hearted child who believed everything that was told me, although
I was again and again imposed (3) upon; so, without another word, I
darted out of the door, and set forth toward the wood. My brother called
after me as loudly as he was able, but I did not heed him.</p>
<p>7．I cared nothing for the wet grass, which was sadly drabbling (4)
my clean frock,—on and on I ran: I was so sure that I knew just where
that rainbow ended. I remember how glad and proud I was in my thoughts,
and what fine presents I promised to all my friends out of my great
riches.</p>
<p>8．So thinking, and laying delightful plans, almost before I knew it
I had reached the cedar grove, and the end of the rainbow was not there!
But I saw it shining down among the trees a little farther off; so on
and on I struggled, through the thick bushes and over logs, till I came
within the sound of a stream which ran through the swamp. Then I
thought, “What if the rainbow should come down right in the middle of
that deep, muddy brook!”</p>
<p>9．Ah! but I was frightened for my heavy pots of gold and silver, and
my purses of money. How should I ever find them there? and what a time I
should have getting them out! I reached the bank of the stream, and “the
end was not yet.” But I could see it a little way off on the other side.
I crossed the creek on a fallen tree, and still ran on, though my limbs
seemed to give way, and my side ached with fatigue.</p>
<p>10．The woods grew thicker and darker, the ground more wet and
swampy, and I found, as many grown people had found before me, that
there was rather hard traveling in a journey after, riches. Suddenly I
met in my way a large porcupine (5) , who made himself still larger when
he saw me, as a cross cat raises its back and makes tails at a dog.
Fearing that he would shoot his sharp quills at me, I ran from him as
fast as my tired feet would carry me.</p>
<p>11．In my fright and hurry I forgot to keep my eye on the rainbow, as
I had done before; and when, at last, I remembered and looked for it, it
was nowhere in sight! It had quite faded away. When I saw that it was
indeed gone, I burst into tears; for I had lost all my treasures, and
had nothing to show for my pilgrimage (6) but muddy feet and a wet and
torn frock. So I set out for home.</p>
<p>12．But I soon found that my troubles had only begun; I could not
find my way: I was lost! I could not tell which was east or west, north
or south, but wandered about here and there, crying and calling, though
I knew that no one could hear me.</p>
<p>13．All at once I heard voices shouting and hallooing; but, instead
of being rejoiced at this, I was frightened, fearing that the Indians
were upon me! I crawled under some bushes, by the side of a large log,
and lay perfectly still. I was wet, cold, scared, altogether very
miserable indeed; yet, when the voices came near, I did not start up and
show myself.</p>
<p>14．At last I heard my own name called; but I remembered that Indians
were very cunning, and thought they might have found it out some way, so
I did not answer. Then came a voice near me, that sounded like that of
my eldest brother, who lived away from home, and whom I had not seen for
many months; but I dared not believe that the voice was his.</p>
<p>15．Soon some one sprang up on the log by which I lay, and stood
there calling. I could not see his face; I could only see the tips of
his toes, but by them I saw that he wore a nice pair of boots, and not
moccasins (7) . Yet I remembered that some Indians dressed like white
folks; so I still kept quiet, till I heard shouted over me a pet name,
which this brother had given me. It was the funniest name in the
world.</p>
<p>16．I knew that no Indian knew of the name, as it was a little family
secret; so I sprang up, and caught my brother about the ankles. I hardly
think that an Indian could have given a louder yell than he gave then;
and he jumped so that he fell off the log down by my side. But nobody
was hurt; and, after kissing me till he had kissed away all my tears, he
hoisted me on to his shoulder, called my other brothers, who were
hunting in different directions, and we all set out for home.</p>
<p>17．I had been gone nearly three hours, and had wandered a number of
miles. My brother Joseph’s coming and asking for me, had first set them
to inquiring and searching me out. When I went into the room where my
brother Rufus sat, he said, “Why, my poor little sister! I did not mean
to send you off on such a wild-goose chase to the end of the rainbow. I
thought you would know I was only quizzing (8) you.”</p>
<p>18．Then my eldest brother took me on his knee, and told me what the
rainbow really is: that it is only painted air, and does not rest on the
earth, so nobody could ever find the end; and that God has set it in the
cloud to remind him and us of his promise never again to drown the world
with a flood. “Oh, I think God’s Promise would be a beautiful name for
the rainbow!” I said.</p>
<p>19．“Yes,” replied my mother, “but it tells us something more than
that he will not send great floods upon the earth,—it tells us of his
beautiful love always bending over us from the skies. And I trust that
when my little girl sets forth on a pilgrimage to find God’s love, she
will be led by the rainbow of his promise through all the dark places of
this world to ‘treasures laid up in heaven,’ better, far better, than
silver or gold.”</p>

<p>作者莎拉·J·利平科特，于1823年出生于纽约的奥内达加，父母是新英格兰人。以格蕾丝·格林伍德为笔名，她写了很多美妙的儿童故事。《五年记录》包括一些著名的故事。</p>
<p>1．大概八岁的时候，一个夏天的下午，我坐在窗户旁，看着天边美丽的彩虹，彩虹从天上弯曲而下，仿佛要消失在四分之一英里外那浓密、潮湿的森林里。</p>
<p>2．当时，房间里除了我哥哥卢夫斯没有别人，他刚生了一场重病，正在恢复呢。他坐在摇椅上，靠着枕头坐着，和我一起看着彩虹。</p>
<p>3．“看啊，哥哥！”我说，“彩虹就落在雪松林里，就是我们春天去找鹿蹄草的地方。”</p>
<p>4．“你知道吗，格蕾西，”我哥哥用特别严肃的口吻说，“如果你到彩虹尽头，你会发现装满钱财的钱包，还有大罐大罐的金银财宝。”</p>
<p>5．“真是这样的吗？”我问他。</p>
<p>6．“真的是这样的。”我哥哥微笑着回答。我那时是个单纯的小女孩，虽然我总是一次又一次被骗，但我还是相信别人告诉我的一切。所以，我什么也没说，就冲出门外，朝着树林跑去。我哥哥大声地喊我，不过我都没注意。</p>
<p>7．我完全不顾潮湿的草地弄脏了我干净的衣裙，只是自顾自地跑着。我很确定地知道彩虹尽头在哪儿了。我记得当时有多么开心自豪，发誓用我的巨大财富给所有好朋友买精美的礼物。</p>
<p>8．这样想着，开心地计划着，直到我发现自己已经到了雪松树林里，可是彩虹的尽头却不在这儿！我明明看见它就在比树林还远一点儿的地方闪耀着啊！我继续挣扎着往前走，穿过茂密的灌木丛，越过地上砍倒的圆木，后来我听到泉水穿过沼泽的声音。然后，我想：“如果彩虹恰好落在那条深深的泥泞小溪里怎么办？”</p>
<p>9．啊！我不禁开始担心我那一罐罐沉重的金银财宝了，还有鼓囊囊的钱包。我怎么才能在那儿找到这些东西呢？要把它们打捞出来可要费劲了！我到了小溪岸边，可是“彩虹尽头不在这儿”。不过我看见就在离溪那边远一点儿的地方。我踩着一棵伐倒的树，过了小溪，继续向前跑，我的双腿已经不听使唤了，腰也累得直疼。</p>
<p>10．森林越来越密，越来越暗，地上也越来越潮湿，越来越泥泞。和很多成年人一样，我发现追逐财富的旅程总是充满艰辛。突然，我面前出现一只大豪猪，它一看见我，就耸起身躯，变得更大了，就像一只生气的猫遇到狗的时候，弓起背，竖起尾巴的样子。我生怕它用长长的刺攻击我，我拖着疲惫的双腿赶忙跑开。</p>
<p>11．惊慌之中，我忘记了彩虹，当我后来想起来要找彩虹的时候，发现根本就看不到了！彩虹已经消失了。当确定彩虹不见了，我号啕大哭起来，因为我丢失了所有的财富，这次寻宝之旅一无所获，而且双腿沾满了泥，裙子湿漉漉的，还破了。我只好回家了。</p>
<p>12．我很快发现我的麻烦才刚刚开始，我找不到回家的路了！我迷路了！我分不出哪儿是东，哪儿是西，哪儿是南，哪儿是北。我在原地转来转去，虽然知道没人能听得到，我还是一边哭，一边大喊大叫。</p>
<p>13．突然之间，我听见有声音在高喊，但我没觉得高兴，而是突然害怕起来，怕印第安人要来追我。我趴在一丛灌木下，旁边是一个伐倒的大圆木，一动不动。我又湿又冷又害怕，总之就是惨极了。但是，声音越来越近，我没有站起来暴露自己。</p>
<p>14．后来我听见有人叫自己的名字，我记得印第安人很狡猾，他们可能通过某种方式知道了我的名字，所以我没有应答。后来有个声音在我旁边呼唤，听着就像我的大哥，可是他不在家里，我已经好几个月没见到他了。但是，我不敢相信这就是他的声音。</p>
<p>15．很快有人跳到我身边的圆木上，站在那儿叫我的名字。我看不见他的脸，从他的鞋尖我看到了他穿着新靴子，不是印第安人穿的轻皮平底鞋。可是我记得有些印第安人会穿得和白人一样，所以我还是一声不响，直到我听到自己的小名，这是我哥哥给我起的。我觉得这是世界上最可笑的名字。</p>
<p>16．我知道印第安人不会知道这个名字的，因为这是我们家里的小秘密。于是，我突然站起来，抓住我哥哥的脚踝。我觉得没有印第安人会叫得比他声音大，他跳了起来，掉下圆木，摔在我旁边。不过我们都没受伤，他亲吻了我，把泪水都亲没了，然后他把我放在他的肩膀上，叫着分头寻找我的其他哥哥们，然后我们一起往家走。</p>
<p>17．我后来知道自己离开了快三个小时，走了好几英里。我大哥约瑟夫正好来家里，知道我的情况后，立即叫人们分头寻找。回到家后，当我到卢夫斯的房间，他说：“哎呀，我可怜的小妹妹。我没想让你白费时间去找彩虹的尽头。我以为你知道我只是逗你玩儿呢。”</p>
<p>18．我大哥把我放在他膝盖上，告诉我彩虹实际上是什么：它只是有颜色的空气，并不停留在地面上。所以，没人可以找到彩虹尽头。上帝让彩虹出现在云端，是在提醒他和人们，他保证再也不会用洪水淹没地球。“哦，我觉得上帝的承诺是彩虹不错的名字呢！”我说。</p>
<p>19．“没错，”妈妈说，“不过，除了告诉我们他不会再用洪水淹没地球，还告诉我们他的爱一直从天空降落到人间。我相信当我的小宝贝开始这场寻找上帝之爱的旅程，在上帝的彩虹引领下，她会穿越世间所有的黑暗，最终找到‘天国的财富’，这远比任何金银财宝都珍贵。”</p>

<h2 id="lesson-72-the-old-oaken-bucket">LESSON 72 THE OLD OAKEN
BUCKET</h2>
<p>旧橡木桶</p>
<p>By Samuel Woodworth, who was born in Massachusetts in 1785．He was
both author and editor. This is his best known poem. He died in
1842.</p>
<p>1．How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood,</p>
<p>When fond recollection presents them to view!</p>
<p>The orchard, the meadow, the deep tangled wildwood,</p>
<p>And every loved spot which my infancy knew;</p>
<p>The wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it:</p>
<p>The bridge and the rock where the cataract (1) fell:</p>
<p>The cot of my father, the dairy house nigh it,</p>
<p>And e’en the rude bucket which hung in the well:</p>
<p>The old oaken bucket, the ironbound bucket,</p>
<p>The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well.</p>
<p>2．That moss-covered vessel I hail as a treasure;</p>
<p>For often, at noon, when returned from the field,</p>
<p>I found it the source of an exquisite (2) pleasure,</p>
<p>The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.</p>
<p>How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing,</p>
<p>And quick to the white-pebble bottom it fell;</p>
<p>Then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing (3) ,</p>
<p>And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well:</p>
<p>The old oaken bucket, the ironbound bucket,</p>
<p>The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.</p>
<p>3．How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it,</p>
<p>As poised (4) on the curb, it inclined to my lips!</p>
<p>Not a full blushing goblet (5) could tempt me to leave it,</p>
<p>Though filled with the nectar (6) which Jupiter sips;</p>
<p>And now, far removed from thy loved situation,</p>
<p>The tear of regret will intrusively (7) swell,</p>
<p>As fancy reverts (8) to my father’s plantation,</p>
<p>And sighs for the bucket which hangs in the well:</p>
<p>The old oaken bucket, the ironbound bucket,</p>
<p>The moss-covered bucket, which hangs in the well.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Who was the author of “The Old Oaken Bucket”? What is said
of this piece? What does the poem describe? and what feeling does it
express?</p>

<p>1．多么美好啊，我那童年的时光！</p>
<p>美妙的回忆把旧时一幕幕带到眼前。</p>
<p>果园、草地和深处茂密的树林，</p>
<p>童年的处处如此可爱：</p>
<p>宽阔的池塘，池塘旁的磨坊，</p>
<p>旁边的小桥、岩石、瀑布流淌，</p>
<p>父亲的木床，旁边的奶牛房，</p>
<p>还有那挂在井里的粗糙木桶，</p>
<p>老旧的橡木桶，铁箍的木桶，</p>
<p>长满苔藓的木桶悬挂在井口。</p>
<p>2．那长满苔藓的木桶啊，我视若珍宝，</p>
<p>每天中午，从田地回到家中，</p>
<p>这是我无限欢乐的来源，</p>
<p>木桶能打来最纯净甘甜的井水。</p>
<p>我激动地用双手紧紧抓住，</p>
<p>快速沉到布满白鹅卵石的井底，</p>
<p>片刻，木桶里仿佛真理满溢，</p>
<p>滴滴清亮，木桶渐渐升到井口。</p>
<p>老旧的橡木桶，铁箍的橡木桶，</p>
<p>长满苔藓的木桶渐渐升到井口。</p>
<p>3．从长满苔藓的桶沿喝水是多么甘甜，</p>
<p>靠在井沿，木桶倾斜到我嘴边，</p>
<p>即使是高脚杯里盛满神仙琼浆</p>
<p>也不能和我交换，</p>
<p>现在，回想当时满是爱的画面，</p>
<p>遗憾的泪水流淌我的脸，</p>
<p>幻想回到爸爸的种植园，</p>
<p>而这只木桶啊，它悬挂在井边，</p>
<p>老旧的橡木桶，铁箍的橡木桶长满苔藓，</p>
<p>就这样，悬挂在井边。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-73-the-sermon-on-the-mount">LESSON 73 THE SERMON ON THE
MOUNT</h2>
<p>登山宝训</p>
<p>1．And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he
was set, his disciples (1) came unto him; and he opened his mouth and
taught them, saying,</p>
<p>2．Blessed (2) are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven. Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit (3) the earth.</p>
<p>3．Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness;
for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful; for they shall
obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.</p>
<p>4．Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children
of God. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake;
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>5．Blessed are ye when men shall revile (4) you, and persecute (5)
you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Rejoice and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven.</p>
<p>6．Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou
shalt not forswear (6) thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine
oaths: but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it
is God’s throne: nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by
Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</p>
<p>7．Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make
one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay,
nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</p>
<p>8．Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil; but
whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,
let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a
mile, go with him twain. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that
would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</p>
<p>9．Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor
and hate thine enemy: but I say unto you, Love your enemies; bless them
that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
despitefully (7) use you and persecute you; that ye may be the children
of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the
evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the
unjust.</p>
<p>10．For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not
even the publicans (8) the same? And if ye salute your brethren only,
what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? Be ye,
therefore, perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
perfect.</p>
<p>11．Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye
judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete (9) , it shall
be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote (10) that is
in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own
eye?</p>
<p>12．Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out
of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite
(11) , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou
see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.</p>
<p>13．Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you: for everyone that asketh, receiveth;
and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be
opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he
give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</p>
<p>14．If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good
things to them that ask him? Therefore all things whatsoever ye would
that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law
and the prophets.</p>
<p>15．Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will
liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the
rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon
that house; and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock.</p>
<p>16．And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them
not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the
sand: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,
and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</p>
<p>17．And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
people were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one having
authority, and not as the scribes (12) .</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—Who delivered this sermon? Who are blessed? and why? Is it
right to swear? How should we treat our enemies? Should we judge others
harshly? What does Jesus say of him who finds faults in his neighbor,
but does not see his own? What is said about prayer? About our conduct
to others?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-313">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．耶稣看见这许多的人，就上了山，既已坐下，门徒到他跟前来。他就开口教训他们，说：</p>
<p>2．“虚心的人有福了，因为天国是他们的。哀恸的人有福了，因为他们必得安慰。温柔的人有福了，因为他们必承受地土。</p>
<p>3．饥渴慕义的人有福了，因为他们必得饱足。怜恤人的人有福了，因为他们必蒙怜恤。清心的人有福了，因为他们必得见神。</p>
<p>4．使人和睦的人有福了，因为他们必称为神的儿子。为义受逼迫的人有福了，因为天国是他们的。</p>
<p>5．人若因我辱骂你们，逼迫你们，捏造各样坏话毁谤你们，你们就有福了。应当欢喜快乐，因为你们在天上的赏赐是大的。</p>
<p>6．你们又听见有吩咐古人的话，说：“不可背誓，所起的誓，总要向主谨守。”只是我告诉你们：甚么誓都不可起。不可指着天起誓，因为天是神的座位；不可指着地起誓，因为地是他的脚凳；也不可指着耶路撒冷起誓，因为耶路撒冷是大君的京城。</p>
<p>7．又不可指着你的头起誓，因为你不能使一根头发变黑变白了。你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是；若再多说，就是出于那恶者（注：或作“是从恶里出来的”）
。</p>
<p>8．你们听见有话说：“以眼还眼，以牙还牙。”只是我告诉你们：不要与恶人作对。有人打你的右脸，连左脸也转过来由他打；有人想要告你，要拿你的里衣，连外衣也由他拿去；有人强逼你走一里路，你就同他走二里；有求你的，就给他；有向你借贷的，不可推辞。</p>
<p>9．你们听见有话说：“当爱你的邻舍，恨你的仇敌。”只是我告诉你们：要爱你们的仇敌，为那逼迫你们的祷告。这样，就可以作你们天父的儿子，因为他叫日头照好人，也照歹人；降雨给义人，也给不义的人。</p>
<p>10．你们若单爱那爱你们的人，有甚么赏赐呢？就是税吏不也是这样行吗？你们若单请你弟兄的安，比人有甚么长处呢？就是外邦人不也是这样行吗？所以你们要完全，像你们的天父完全一样。</p>
<p>11．你们不要论断人，免得你们被论断。因为你们怎样论断人，也必怎样被论断；你们用甚么量器量给人，也必用甚么量器量给你们。为甚么看见你弟兄眼中有刺，却不想自己眼中有梁木呢？</p>
<p>12．你自己眼中有梁木，怎能对你弟兄说“容我去掉你眼中的刺”呢？你这假冒为善的人！先去掉自己眼中的梁木，然后才能看得清楚，去掉你弟兄眼中的刺。</p>
<p>13．你们祈求，就给你们；寻找，就寻见；叩门，就给你们开门。因为凡祈求的，就得着；寻找的，就寻见；叩门的，就给他开门。你们中间谁有儿子求饼，反给他石头呢？求鱼，反给他蛇呢？</p>
<p>14．你们虽然不好，尚且知道拿好东西给儿女，何况你们在天上的父，岂不更把好东西给求他的人吗？所以，无论何事，你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人，因为这就是律法和先知的道理。</p>
<p>15．所以，凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人，把房子盖在磐石上。雨淋，水冲，风吹，撞着那房子，房子总不倒塌，因为根基立在磐石上。</p>
<p>16．凡听见我这话不去行的，好比一个无知的人，把房子盖在沙土上。雨淋，水冲，风吹，撞着那房子，房子就倒塌了，并且倒塌得很大。</p>
<p>17．耶稣讲完了这些话，众人都希奇他的教训。因为他教训他们，正像有权柄的人，不像他们的文士。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-74-the-young-witness">LESSON 74 THE YOUNG WITNESS</h2>
<p>小证人</p>
<p>1．A little girl nine years of age was brought into court, and
offered as a witness (1) against a prisoner who was on trial for a crime
committed (2) in her father’s house.</p>
<p>2．“Now, Emily,” said the counsel (3) for the prisoner, “I wish to
know if you understand the nature of an oath?”</p>
<p>3．“I don’t know what you mean,” was the simple answer.</p>
<p>4．“Your Honor,” said the counsel, addressing the judge, “it is
evident that this witness should be rejected (4) . She does not
understand the nature of an oath.”</p>
<p>5．“Let us see,” said the judge. “Come here, my daughter.”</p>
<p>6．Assured (5) by the kind tone and manner of the judge, the child
stepped toward him, and looked confidingly (6) in his face, with a calm,
clear eye, and in a manner so artless and frank that it went straight to
the heart.</p>
<p>7．“Did you ever take an oath?” inquired the judge.</p>
<p>8．The little girl stepped back with a look of horror; and the red
blood rose and spread in a blush all over her face and neck, as she
answered, “No, sir.” She thought he intended to ask if she had ever used
profane (7) language.</p>
<p>9．“I do not mean that,” said the judge, who saw her mistake; “I mean
were you ever a witness?”</p>
<p>10．“No, sir; I never was in court before,” was the answer.</p>
<p>11．He handed her the Bible open. “Do you know that book, my
daughter?”</p>
<p>12．She looked at it and answered, “Yes, sir; it is the Bible.”</p>
<p>13．“Do you ever read in it?” he asked.</p>
<p>14．“Yes, sir; every evening.”</p>
<p>15．“Can you tell me what the Bible is?” inquired the judge.</p>
<p>16．“It is the word of the great God,” she answered.</p>
<p>17．“Well,” said the judge, “place your hand upon this Bible, and
listen to what I say;” and he repeated slowly and solemnly the following
oath: “Do you swear that in the evidence which you shall give in this
case, you will tell the truth, and nothing but the truth; and that you
will ask God to help you?”</p>
<p>18．“I do,” she replied.</p>
<p>19．“Now,” said the judge, “you have been sworn as a witness; will
you tell me what will befall you if you do not tell the truth?”</p>
<p>20．“I shall be shut up in the state prison,” answered the child.</p>
<p>21．“Anything else?” asked the judge.</p>
<p>22．“I shall never go to heaven,” she replied.</p>
<p>23．“How do you know this?” asked the judge again.</p>
<p>24．The child took the Bible, turned rapidly to the chapter
containing the commandments, and, pointing to the one which reads, “Thou
shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,” said, “I learned
that before I could read.”</p>
<p>25．“Has anyone talked with you about being a witness in court here
against this man?” inquired the judge.</p>
<p>26．“Yes, sir,” she replied, “my mother heard they wanted me to be a
witness; and last night she called me to her room, and asked me to tell
her the Ten Commandments; and then we kneeled down together, and she
prayed that I might understand how wicked it was to bear false witness
against my neighbor, and that God would help me, a little child, to tell
the truth as it was before him.”</p>
<p>27．“And when I came up here with father, she kissed me, and told me
to remember the Ninth Commandment, and that God would hear every word
that I said.”</p>
<p>28．“Do you believe this?” asked the judge, while a tear glistened in
his eye, and his lip quivered with emotion.</p>
<p>29．“Yes, sir,” said the child, with a voice and manner which showed
that her conviction of the truth was perfect.</p>
<p>30．“God bless you, my child,” said the judge, “you have a good
mother. The witness is competent,” he continued. “Were I on trial for my
life, and innocent of the charge against me, I would pray God for such a
witness as this. Let her be examined.”</p>
<p>31．She told her story with the simplicity of a child, as she was;
but her voice and manner carried conviction of her truthfulness to every
heart.</p>
<p>32．The lawyers asked her many perplexing questions, but she did not
vary in the least from her first statement.</p>
<p>33．The truth, as spoken by a little child, was sublime. Falsehood
and perjury (8) had preceded her testimony; but before her testimony,
falsehood was scattered like chaff (9) .</p>
<p>34．The little child, for whom a mother had prayed for strength to be
given her to speak the truth as it was before God, broke the cunning
device of matured (10) villainy to pieces, like a potter’s (11) vessel.
The strength that her mother prayed for was given her; and the sublime
and terrible simplicity,—terrible to the prisoner and his
associates,—was like a revelation (12) from God himself.</p>
<p>(S. H. HAMMOND)</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—What is this story about? Why did the counsel wish to have
Emily refused as a witness? Was she a fit person to be a witness? How
was this shown? Which commandment forbids us to bear false witness? What
was the result of Emily’s testimony?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-314">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．一个九岁大的小女孩被带上法庭，作为证人将要指证一个在他父亲的房间行窃的嫌疑犯。</p>
<p>2．“来，艾米丽，”嫌疑犯的辩护律师说，“我希望了解你是否知道誓言的本质。”</p>
<p>3．“我不知道您的意思。”艾米丽简单地回答。</p>
<p>4．“尊敬的法官大人，”辩护律师对法官说，“很显然不能用这个证人。她都不明白誓言的本质。”</p>
<p>5．“让我想想，”法官说，“过来，小姑娘。”</p>
<p>6．法官和善的语气和表情让小女孩很安心，她走向法官，信任地看着他的脸，眼神平静、纯洁，毫无掩饰，让人一眼就能看透她的心灵。</p>
<p>7．“你发过誓吗？”法官问。</p>
<p>8．小姑娘害怕地向后退了一步，血液涌上来，脸和脖子都涨红了，她回答道：“没有，先生。”她以为法官在问她有没有说过亵渎神的话。</p>
<p>9．“我不是这个意思，”法官发现她误解了，接着说，“我是问你有没有做过证人？”</p>
<p>10．她回答：“没有，先生，我从来没有出过庭。”</p>
<p>11．法官递给小女孩一本打开的《圣经》，问：“你知道这本书吗，小姑娘？”</p>
<p>12．她看了看说：“我知道，先生，这是《圣经》。”</p>
<p>13．他问：“你读过吗？”</p>
<p>14．“是的，先生，每天晚上都读。”</p>
<p>15．“你能告诉我《圣经》是什么吗？”法官问。</p>
<p>16．“这是上帝说的话。”她回答。</p>
<p>17．“好的，”法官说，“把你的手放在这本《圣经》上，听我说。”于是他缓慢而严肃地重复了如下的誓言：“你是否发誓你在为本案提供证据时，只讲实话，绝不欺骗。你会请求上帝来帮助你吗？”</p>
<p>18．“我发誓。”她回答。</p>
<p>19．“好的，”法官说，“你已经发誓作为一名证人。你能告诉我，如果不说实话的话你会有什么后果吗？”</p>
<p>20．“我会被关在监狱里。”小女孩说。</p>
<p>21．“还有呢？”法官问。</p>
<p>22．“我将永远不能去天堂了。”她回答。</p>
<p>23．“你怎么知道这些的？”法官接着问。</p>
<p>24．孩子拿过《圣经》，迅速翻到“十诫”那一章，指着其中的一节，上面写着：“你们不应该做伪证，陷害你们的邻居。”孩子说，“我认字以前就知道。”</p>
<p>25．“有人曾经和你说过，你要在法庭上作证揭发这个人吗？”法官问。</p>
<p>26．“是的，先生，”她回答说，“我母亲听说他们希望我出庭作证之后，昨天晚上把我叫到她的房间，让我告诉他‘十诫’是什么，然后我们一起跪下来，她祷告说希望我知道作伪证陷害邻居是邪恶的，她祈祷上帝保佑我，一个幼小的孩童，能够像在上帝面前一样讲实话。”</p>
<p>27．“我和父亲一起来这里的时候，母亲亲吻了我，她告诉我要谨记第九诫的内容，她说我说的每个字上帝都会听到的。”</p>
<p>28．“你相信这些吗？”法官问，他的眼里闪烁着泪花，嘴唇激动地颤抖着。</p>
<p>29．“我相信，先生。”她的声音和神态都显示她确信无疑。</p>
<p>30．“上帝保佑你，我的孩子，”法官说，“你有一个好母亲。你可以胜任证人的工作，”他继续说，“如果无辜面临审判，我也会祈祷上帝给我派来这样的一个证人。你们可以询问她了。”</p>
<p>31．她用一个孩子的方式简单叙述了她看到的经过，因为她就是个孩子，但她的声音和态度令每个人从心里对她说的话没有丝毫疑问。</p>
<p>32．律师问了很多复杂的问题，但她的陈述始终是一致的。</p>
<p>33．正如这个孩子所说，真理是神圣的。在她作证人之前有人说谎和做伪证，可是在她的证言面前，一切虚假都像谷壳般破碎。</p>
<p>34．这个小孩子，她的母亲曾为她祷告，使她拥有讲真话的力量，就像面对上帝一样，这把某些成年人编造的狡猾的谎言击成碎片，仿佛打破陶器。她母亲向神祷告祈求力量，而她那崇高却可怕的简洁话语——对罪犯和同伙来说是可怕的——就像来自上帝的启示一样。</p>

THE ANTS</h2>
<p>所罗门王和蚂蚁</p>
<p>By John Greenleaf Whittier, born near Haverhill, Mass., In 1807, and
died at Hampton Falls, N. H., In 1892. Until he was eighteen years old
he worked on the farm, and during that time learned the trade at a
shoemaker. He afterwards became an editor and one of the first poets of
America.</p>
<p>1．Out from Jerusalem</p>
<p>The king rode with his great</p>

<p>3．Wisest of men, he knew</p>

<p>That trod the earth or flew.</p>
<p>4．Across an ant-hill led</p>
<p>The king’s path, and he heard</p>
<p>Its small folk, and their word</p>

<p>5．“Here comes the king men greet (2)</p>
<p>As wise and good and just,</p>
<p>To crush us in the dust</p>
<p>Under his heedless feet.”</p>
<p>6．The great king bowed his head,</p>
<p>And saw the wide surprise</p>
<p>Of the Queen of Sheba’s eyes</p>
<p>As he told her what they said.</p>
<p>7．“O king!” she whispered sweet,</p>
<p>“Too happy fate have they</p>
<p>Who perish in thy way</p>
<p>Beneath thy gracious feet!</p>
<p>8．“Thou of the God-lent crown,</p>
<p>Shall these vile creatures dare</p>
<p>Murmur against thee where</p>
<p>The knees of kings kneel down?”</p>
<p>9．“Nay,” Solomon replied,</p>
<p>“The wise and strong should seek</p>
<p>The welfare (3) of the weak;”</p>
<p>And turned his horse aside.</p>
<p>10．His train (4) , with quick alarm,</p>
<p>Curved with their leader round</p>
<p>The ant-hill’s peopled mound,</p>
<p>And left it free from harm.</p>
<p>11．The jeweled head bent low;</p>
<p>“O king!” she said, “henceforth</p>
<p>The secret of thy worth</p>
<p>And wisdom well I know.</p>
<p>12．“Happy must be the State</p>
<p>Whose ruler heedeth more</p>
<p>The murmurs of the poor</p>
<p>Than flatteries (5) of the great.”</p>

<p>所有的王都要向您跪拜。</p>
<p>这些卑微的家伙胆敢，</p>
<p>对您的行为指指点点。”</p>
<p>9．“不是这样的。”所罗门王说道，</p>

<p>说话间他把马头转向一边。</p>
<p>10．他的车队，紧急号令，</p>

<h2 id="lesson-76-rivermouth-theater">LESSON 76 RIVERMOUTH THEATER</h2>
<p>河口剧院</p>
<p>From “The Story of a Bad Boy,” by Thomas Bailey Aldrich. The author
was born at Portsmouth, N. H., in 1836. When quite young his family
moved to Louisiana, but he was sent back to New England to be educated,
and later he located at New York. He is a well-known writer of both
prose and poetry.</p>
<p>1．“Now, boys, what shall we do?” I asked, addressing a thoughtful
conclave (1) of seven, assembled in our barn one dismal, rainy
afternoon. “Let’s have a theater,” suggested Binny Wallace.</p>
<p>2．The very thing! But where? The loft of the stable was ready to
burst with hay provided for Gypsy, but the long room over the carriage
house was unoccupied. The place of all places! My managerial (2) eye saw
at a glance its capabilities for a theater.</p>
<p>3．I had been to the play a great many times in New Orleans, and was
wise in matters pertaining to the drama. So here, in due time, was set
up some extraordinary scenery of my own painting. The curtain, I
recollect, though it worked smoothly enough on other occasions,
invariably hitched during the performances.</p>
<p>4．The theater, however, was a success, as far as it went. I retired
from the business with no fewer than fifteen hundred pins, after
deducting (3) the headless, the pointless, and the crooked pins with
which our doorkeeper frequently got “stuck.” From first to last we took
in a great deal of this counterfeit money. The price of admission to the
“Rivermouth Theater” was twenty pins. I played all the principal
characters myself—not that I was a finer actor than the other boys, but
because I owned the establishment.</p>
<p>5．At the tenth representation, my dramatic career (4) was brought to
a close by an unfortunate circumstance. We were playing the drama of
“William Tell, the Hero of Switzerland.” Of course I was William Tell,
in spite of Fred Langdon, who wanted to act that character himself. I
wouldn’t let him, so he withdrew from the company, taking the only bow
and arrow we had.</p>
<p>6．I made a crossbow out of a piece of whalebone, and did very well
without him. We had reached that exciting scene where Gesler, the
Austrian tyrant, commands Tell to shoot the apple from his son’s head.
Pepper Whitcomb, who played all the juvenile and women parts, was my
son.</p>
<p>7．To guard against mischance, a piece of pasteboard was fastened by
a handkerchief over the upper portion of Whitcomb’s face, while the
arrow to be used was sewed up in a strip of flannel. I was a capital
marksman, and the big apple, only two yards distant, turned its russet
cheek fairly towards me.</p>
<p>8．I can see poor little Pepper now, as he stood without flinching,
waiting for me to perform my great feat. I raised the crossbow amid the
breathless silence of the crowded audience (5) —consisting of seven boys
and three girls, exclusive of Kitty Collins, who insisted on paying her
way in with a clothespin. I raised the crossbow, I repeat. Twang! went
the whipcord; but, alas! instead of hitting the apple, the arrow flew
right into Pepper Whitcomb’s mouth, which happened to be open at the
time, and destroyed my aim.</p>
<p>9．I shall never be able to banish that awful moment from my memory.
Pepper’s roar, expressive of astonishment, indignation, and pain, is
still ringing in my ears. I looked upon him as a corpse, and, glancing
not far into the dreary future, pictured myself led forth to execution
(6) in the presence of the very same spectators then assembled.</p>
<p>10．Luckily, poor Pepper was not seriously hurt; but Grandfather
Nutter, appearing in the midst of the confusion (attracted by the howls
of young Tell), issued an injunction (7) against all theatricals
thereafter, and the place was closed; not, however, without a farewell
speech from me, in which I said that this would have been the proudest
moment of my life if I hadn’t hit Pepper Whitcomb in the mouth.
Whereupon the audience (assisted, I am glad to state, by Pepper) cried,
“Hear! hear!”</p>
<p>11．I then attributed (8) the accident to Pepper himself, whose
mouth, being open at the instant I fired, acted upon the arrow much
after the fashion of a whirlpool, and drew in the fatal shaft. I was
about to explain how a comparatively small maelstrom (9) could suck in
the largest ship, when the curtain fell of its own accord, amid the
shouts of the audience.</p>
<p>12．This was my last appearance on any stage. It was some time,
though, before I heard the end of the William Tell business. Malicious
little boys who hadn’t been allowed to buy tickets to my theater used to
cry out after me in the street, “‘Who killed Cock Robin?’”</p>

<p>本文节选自《顽童故事》，作者是托马斯•贝利•奥德里奇，1836年出生在新罕布什尔州的朴茨茅斯市。很小的时候全家搬迁到路易斯安那州，但作者被送回新英格兰接受教育，后来定居纽约。他是著名的散文和诗歌作家。</p>
<p>1．“现在，男孩们，咱们做点什么呢？”我问参加秘密会议的七个男孩子。阴霾的雨天的下午，我们聚集在我家谷仓里讨论。“我们建个剧场吧。”宾尼•华莱士建议。</p>
<p>2．好主意！可是建在哪儿呢？马棚的阁楼装满了给马准备的干草，不过马车库对面的长房间还空着。这真是个好地方！我用主办人的眼光看了看这个地方能不能建成剧场。</p>
<p>3．在新奥尔良的时候，我去过很多次剧场，对于排练的事情非常熟悉。所以，在这儿，我很快自己制作了很多绝妙的布景。我记得幕布在其他任何场合都很好用，只是在演出的时候无可挽救地被钩住了。</p>
<p>4．不过，到目前为止，剧院很成功。结束这个行当的时候，我收集了不下一千五百多根钉子，还有很多没帽的、没尖的、弯曲的坏钉子，剧场的看门人拿这些钉子也毫无办法。从始至终我们就收了不少这样的“假币”。我们“河口剧院”的入场券是二十根钉子。我亲自扮演了所有的主要角色——不是因为我比其他男孩演技好，而是因为我是剧场的主人。</p>
<p>5．第十场演出的时候，因为当时发生了意外，我的演艺生涯划上了句号。我们当时正在演出《瑞士英雄威廉•泰尔》。当然我饰演了威廉•泰尔，不过弗雷德•兰登自己也想演这个角色。我当然不会让他演的，所以他从剧场撤出了，还带走了我们唯一的弓箭。</p>
<p>6．我用鲸须做了一副十字弓，所以没有他也能演得下去。我们演了令人激动的一幕：澳大利亚暴君盖斯勒命令泰尔射击他儿子头上的苹果。佩珀•惠特科姆一直都演幼童和妇女的角色，这次他演我的儿子。</p>
<p>7．为了防止发生意外，佩珀的脸的上面部分用手绢绑了一块纸板，射击的箭也是用法兰绒条做的。我是个神射手，大苹果在两码之外，金灿灿地正对着我。</p>
<p>8．我能看见佩珀，他站在那里一点儿都不害怕，等着我的壮举。我抬起十字弓，拥挤的观众屏住呼吸。这些观众有七个男孩和三个女孩，不包括吉蒂•科林斯，她非要用一个衣夹来当门票。我举起十字弓，拉了两次。哐当！弓弦响了。可是，天哪！箭没有射中苹果，而是径直飞到惠特科姆的嘴巴里，正好那时他是张着嘴的。</p>
<p>9．我永远不会忘记那可怕的一刻。佩珀号叫着，充满吃惊、愤怒和痛苦，这声音至今还回响在我的耳边。我看着他，就像看着一具尸体。同时我看到自己可怕的未来，想象着我当着同样这些人的面，被拉上刑场处决。</p>
<p>10．幸运的是，可怜的佩珀伤势并不重。但是，纳特爷爷在混乱中出现了（被小泰尔的号叫吸引来的），他下令从此停止一切演出，剧院关闭了。不过我没忘了来场告别演讲，我说，如果没有射中佩珀•惠特科姆的嘴巴，这将是我一生最光荣的时刻。这时，观众呼叫起来（很高兴地说，佩珀也在其中），说：“听！听！”</p>
<p>11．然后，我把事故原因归结于佩珀自己，因为刚好在我射击的时候，他的嘴巴是张开的，他张开的大嘴巴像漩涡一样，把箭吸了进去。我刚要解释一个小小的漩涡如何可以把大轮船吸进去，幕布自己掉了下来，观众也开始喊叫起来。</p>
<p>12．这是我最后一次出现在舞台上。不过之后很久，人们还是会说起威廉•泰尔的事情。那些没能买票进我的剧院观看的调皮男孩们，经常在街上跟着我喊叫：“谁杀死了知更鸟？”</p>

<h2 id="lesson-77-alfred-the-great">LESSON 77 ALFRED THE GREAT</h2>
<p>阿尔弗雷德大帝</p>
<p>1．More than a thousand years ago, (in the year 849), a prince was
born in England, who afterwards became one of the most celebrated and
best loved kings in the world. His name was Alfred—afterwards called
Alfred the Great—and he was the favorite son both of the king and
queen.</p>
<p>2．In those days the common people were very ignorant; few of them
could even read and write. There were no schools, and the monasteries
(1) , where almost the only teaching had been done, were nearly all
destroyed in the wars which were continually going on. Only the higher
classes had any chance to study, and even they paid much more attention
to fighting than to studying.</p>
<p>3．But Alfred was different from most persons of his time. Even when
a little boy, he delighted in listening to poems and to the ballads
which harpers used to sing, and he learned many of them by heart. When
he was twelve years old, his mother, the queen, offered to give a volume
of poems to that one of her four sons who would first learn to read it.
Alfred was the youngest of them all, yet he easily won the prize of
which his brothers thought so little.</p>
<p>4．But, as has been said, these were stirring times, and Alfred was
soon called on to show his great abilities as a soldier. The Danes, a
warlike people, were continually swooping down in their vessels upon the
coast of England. Often they spread over the entire country, plundering
and burning the towns, and killing the people.</p>
<p>5．In the midst of these invasions (2) Alfred became king, when he
was only twenty-two years old. He proved as good a warrior as he was a
student. He thought that whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing
well. He was generally successful against the Danes, but at one time
they seemed to have the country entirely in their power, and Alfred was
compelled to hide for his life.</p>
<p>6．For some time he dressed as a peasant, and lived in the cottage of
a cowherd, who was so careful of his king’s safety that he did not even
tell his wife who he was. So she treated the king as a common peasant,
and one day gave him a sharp scolding because he allowed some cakes to
burn on the griddle, after she had left him to watch them. She told him
he was clever enough at eating cakes though he managed so badly at
baking them.</p>
<p>7．When the search for him grew less active, Alfred gradually
collected some of his followers, with whom he encamped on a small spot
of firm ground in the center of a bog. It was surrounded by almost
impassable forests, and Alfred fortified the place so that it could not
well be taken. Then he made frequent sudden and successful attacks on
the enemy until his troops and the people became encouraged.</p>
<p>8．One victory in particular, when they captured a banner which the
Danes thought enchanted, led Alfred to take bolder steps. He wished to
find out the exact condition of the enemy, and, for this purpose,
disguised (3) himself as a harper and entered their camp. He was so
successful in his disguise that he remained there some days, even being
admitted to the tent of the Danish leader Guthrum.</p>
<p>9．He found their entire army living in careless security, and so he
determined to make a sudden and bold attack on them, to try and rid his
country once more of these cruel invaders. He summoned his people about
him from far and wide. Many of them had long thought their beloved king
dead, but now all eagerly obeyed his call.</p>
<p>10．He at once led them against that part of the camp which he had
seen to be most unguarded. The attack was entirely unexpected; and,
although the Danes were greater in numbers, they were defeated with
great slaughter. Some of them, with their leader, fled to a fortified
place, but were soon obliged to surrender.</p>
<p>11．Alfred granted them their lives, and settled them in a part of
his kingdom where nearly all his own people had been destroyed. He hoped
by this to change obstinate enemies into useful friends who would
protect England from further attacks of their own countrymen. However,
some years later, when the Danes made another invasion, these people
joined them in fighting against Alfred, but he soon succeeded in driving
them all out of the country.</p>
<p>12．Much as Alfred did for his people in war, he did more in time of
peace. Above all else he gave careful attention to their education. He
rebuilt the monasteries and aided the young University (4) of Oxford. He
also founded many schools, to which every owner of a certain portion of
land was compelled to send his children.</p>
<p>13．But he did as much good by the example that he set as by these
acts. His time was divided into three parts. One was given to business,
one to refreshment by sleep and food, and the third to study and
devotion. Clocks and watches, and probably even sundials, were then
unknown, so these divisions were marked by burning candles of equal
lengths.</p>
<p>14．Alfred did not study for his own pleasure merely, but translated
(5) and wrote many works for the good of his people, using the simple
language which they could easily understand and enjoy. His person was
handsome and dignified, full of grace and activity. But the more noble
beauty was within, in the enlightened (6) mind and virtuous heart of the
king. After his name, which has its place on an ancient record of
English kings, is written the noble title of “Truth Teller.”</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-317">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．一千多年以前（公元849年），一个王子出生在英格兰，他后来成为世界上最著名、最受人爱戴的国王之一。他的名字叫阿尔弗雷德——后来被称为阿尔弗雷德大帝——他是国王和王后最喜爱的儿子。</p>
<p>2．那个时候，人们非常无知，几乎没有几个人会读会写。当时没有学校，唯一可以接受教育的地方是修道院，但几乎被当时连绵不断的战火摧毁了。只有贵族有机会接受教育，即使是他们，对战争投入的关注也比学习大很多。</p>
<p>3．但是，阿尔弗雷德和当时的大部分人不一样。当他还是小孩子的时候，他就喜欢听竖琴师唱诗歌和民谣，甚至很多都会背了。十二岁的时候，他的母后拿出一卷诗歌，对四个儿子说，谁先会读，就把这本诗歌送给他。阿尔弗雷德最小，但他轻松赢得了奖励，而他的哥哥们满不在乎。</p>
<p>4．但是，前面已经说过，当时正是战乱时期，阿尔弗雷德很快要入伍成为一名战士。好战的丹麦人不断乘船袭击英格兰的海岸，他们常常遍布全国，烧杀掳掠，无恶不作。</p>
<p>5．在战火中，阿尔弗雷德成为国王，当时他才二十二岁。他证明了自己不但是个好学生，还是个好战士。他认为任何值得做的事情，要做就要做好。在对抗丹麦人的战斗中他很多时候处于优势，但有一次几乎整个国家都被丹麦掌控了，阿尔弗雷德被迫藏身逃命。</p>
<p>6．有一段时间他打扮成农民模样，住在一个牧民家。这个牧民对国王的安全十分小心谨慎，所以甚至没告诉自己的妻子他是谁。所以，牧民的妻子像对待普通农民一样对待国王。一天，她还狠狠地责备了他一顿，因为让照看的蛋糕不小心烤糊了。牧民的妻子说他吃蛋糕可比烤蛋糕聪明多了。</p>
<p>7．当丹麦人放松对他的搜捕时，阿尔弗雷德渐渐聚拢起一些追随者，他们聚集在沼泽中心一小块结实的平地上。这块地四周都是密林，难以通过，加之阿尔弗雷德修筑了防御工事，因此易守难攻。他频繁袭击敌人，大获成功，他的军队和人民都很受鼓舞。</p>
<p>8．在一次胜利中，他们夺取了丹麦人认为有魔法的一面旗帜，这促使阿尔弗雷德采取更大胆的行动。他希望准确地了解敌军的情况，为了达到目的，他自己装扮成竖琴师的模样，进入了敌营。他伪装得非常成功，在敌营待了好几天，甚至还被允许进入丹麦首领古特罗姆的营帐。</p>
<p>9．他发现整个敌军守卫非常松散，所以他决定突袭敌军，使他的国家永久摆脱被入侵的命运。他广泛地召集士兵，很多人原以为他们热爱的国王已经去世，现在纷纷响应他的号召。</p>
<p>10．他迅速带领军队攻击他之前发现的敌营守卫最薄弱的地方。整个袭击令敌人始料未及，尽管丹麦人数量很多，但他们死伤众多，吃了败仗。很多士兵跟着首领逃到一处堡垒，但很快就被迫投降了。</p>
<p>11．阿尔弗雷德饶了他们的命，让他们居住在王国的土地上，那里他的子民基本已经在战争中全部死亡了。他希望这样能够把他顽固的敌人变成有用的朋友，在其他丹麦人入侵时保卫英格兰。可是，几年后，丹麦人再次入侵时，这些人加入他们，联合对抗阿尔弗雷德，但阿尔弗雷德很快就成功地把他们赶出了自己的国家。</p>
<p>12．阿尔弗雷德在战争年代保卫国家，在和平年代一样也为国民做了很多。其中最重要的一点是他特别重视教育。他重修了修道院，资助了新建的牛津大学。他还开办了很多学校，所有土地的拥有者都必须把子女送去读书。</p>
<p>13．不仅如此，他自己更是以身作则。他的时间分成三部分，一部分用于日常事务，一部分用于睡觉吃饭获得休息，还有一部分用于学习和宗教活动。当时还没有钟，也没有表，甚至连日晷都没有，所以这三部分时间的划分是以燃烧相同长度的蜡烛来判断的。</p>
<p>14．阿尔弗雷德不仅仅为了自己的喜好才学习，他还为自己的国民翻译和亲自撰写了很多书籍，全是用他们很容易就能理解和生动优美的简单语言。阿尔弗雷德大帝长相英俊、态度端庄、举止优雅、充满活力，但他更高尚的美是内在的，也就是开明的头脑和善良的内心。在一本古老的记录英格兰国王的书中，在他的名字后面，人们写了这个高贵的名号：“讲真话的人。”</p>

<h2 id="lesson-79-hugh-idle-and-mr.-toil">LESSON 79 HUGH IDLE AND MR.
TOIL</h2>
<p>休•艾德和特劳先生</p>
<p>Adapted from the story of “Little Daffydowndilly,” by Nathaniel
Hawthorne. The author was born at Salem, Mass., in 1804, and ranks among
the first of American novelists. He died in 1864.</p>
<p>1．Hugh Idle loved to do only what was agreeable (1) , and took no
delight in labor of any kind. But while Hugh was yet a little boy, he
was sent away from home, and put under the care of a very strict
schoolmaster, who went by the name of Mr. Toil.</p>
<p>2．Those who knew him best, affirmed (2) that Mr. Toil was a very
worthy character, and that he had done more good, both to children and
grown people, than anybody else in the world. He had, however, a severe
and ugly countenance; his voice was harsh; and all his ways and customs
were disagreeable to our young friend, Hugh Idle.</p>
<p>3．The whole day long this terrible old schoolmaster sulked about
among his scholars, with a big cane in his hand; and unless a lad chose
to attend constantly and quietly to his book, he had no chance of
enjoying a single quiet moment. “This will never do for me,” thought
Hugh; “I’ll run off, and try to find my way home.”</p>
<p>4．So the very next morning off he started, with only some bread and
cheese for his breakfast, and very little pocket money to pay his
expenses (3) . He had gone but a short distance, when he overtook a man
of grave and sedate (4) appearance trudging at a moderate (5) pace along
the road.</p>
<p>5．“Good morning, my fine lad!” said the stranger; and his voice
seemed hard and severe, yet had a sort of kindness in it; “whence do you
come so early, and whither are you going?”</p>
<p>6．Now Hugh was a boy of very frank disposition (6) , and had never
been known to tell a lie in all his life. Nor did he tell one now, but
confessed (7) that he had run away from school on account of his great
dislike to Mr. Toil. “Oh, very well, my little friend!” answered the
stranger; “then we will go together; for I likewise have had a good deal
to do with Mr. Toil, and should be glad to find some place where he was
never heard of.” So they walked on very sociably (8) side by side.</p>
<p>7．By and by their road led them past a field, where some haymakers
were at work. Hugh could not help thinking how much pleasanter it must
be to make hay in the sunshine, under the blue sky, than to learn
lessons all day long, shut up in a dismal schoolroom, continually
watched by Mr. Toil.</p>
<p>8．But in the midst of these thoughts, while he was stopping to peep
over the stone wall, he started back and caught hold of his companion’s
hand. “Quick, quick!” cried he; “let us run away, or he will catch
us!”</p>
<p>9．“Who will catch us?” asked the stranger.</p>
<p>10．“Mr. Toil, the old schoolmaster,” answered Hugh; “don’t you see
him among the haymakers?” and Hugh pointed to an elderly man, who seemed
to be the owner of the field.</p>
<p>11．He was busily at work in his shirt sleeves. The drops of sweat
stood upon his brow; and he kept constantly crying out to his work
people to make hay while the sun shone. Strange to say, the features (9)
of the old farmer were precisely the same as those of Mr. Toil, who at
that very moment must have been just entering the schoolroom.</p>
<p>12．“Don’t be afraid,” said the stranger; “this is not Mr. Toil, the
schoolmaster, but a brother of his, who was bred a farmer. He won’t
trouble you, unless you become a laborer on his farm.”</p>
<p>13．Hugh believed what his companion said, but was glad when they
were out of sight of the old farmer who bore such a singular resemblance
(10) to Mr. Toil. The two travelers came to a spot where some carpenters
were building a house. Hugh begged his companion to stop awhile, for it
was a pretty sight to see how neatly the carpenters did their work with
their saws, planes, and hammers; and he was beginning to think he too
should like to use the saw, and the plane, and the hammer, and be a
carpenter himself. But suddenly he caught sight of something that made
him seize his friend’s hand, in a great fright.</p>
<p>14．“Make haste! quick, quick!” cried he; “there’s old Mr. Toil
again.” The stranger cast his eyes where Hugh pointed his finger, and
saw an elderly man, who seemed to be overseeing the carpenters, as he
went to and fro about the unfinished house, marking out the work to be
done, and urging the men to be diligent (11) ; and wherever he turned
his hard and wrinkled visage (12) , they sawed and hammered as if for
dear life.</p>
<p>15．“Oh, no! this is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster,” said the
stranger; “it is another brother of his who follows the trade of
carpenter.”</p>
<p>16．“I am very glad to hear it,” quoth (13) Hugh; “but if you please,
sir, I should like to get out of his way as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>1．休•艾德只做他喜欢做的事，不喜欢任何劳动。当休还是小男孩的时候，他就离开了家，被送到非常严厉的教师特劳先生那里学习。</p>
<p>2．认识特劳先生的人都知道，特劳先生是个值得敬重的人，他为孩子，也为成年人所做的好事比世界上任何人都要多。不过，他表情严肃，长相丑陋，声音刺耳。他的所有方式和习惯让我们的小朋友休•艾德很不喜欢。</p>
<p>3．从早到晚，这个可怕的老教师总在学生之间踱来踱去，手里拿着一个大手杖，只有他的学生们认真安静地看书的时候，他才能享受一会儿自己的安静时光。“我可受不了这样，”休•艾德想，“我得逃走，找到回家的路。”</p>
<p>4．所以第二天早上，他就离开了，只带了早餐的几片面包和奶酪，还有很少的零花钱。他刚走出去没多远，就看见一个形色冷峻的人在路上不急不忙地走着。</p>
<p>5．“早上好，小家伙！”这个陌生人说。他的声音听起来生硬、严肃，不过透着和善，“你怎么这么早？这是要去哪儿啊？”</p>
<p>6．这时的休还是个非常直性子的小男孩，他从来没说过谎话。所以现在他也没说谎，承认他因为特别不喜欢特劳先生，而从学校跑出来了。这个陌生人说：“哦，很好，我的年轻朋友。那我们一起走吧。因为我也受不了特劳先生，我们得找一个他从来没听过的地方。”这样，他们友好地一起往前走。</p>
<p>7．走着走着，他们穿过了一片田地，那儿有些人在晒干草。休禁不住想：在阳光和蓝天下晒干草，这比一整天关在阴暗的教室里，被特劳先生看着学习要快乐多了！</p>
<p>8．他一边想，一边透过石头墙的缝隙往里看了一眼，突然转过去，拉着同伴的手，喊叫着：“快点，快点！我们赶紧跑，要不然他就抓住我们了！”</p>
<p>9．“谁会抓住我们？”陌生人问。</p>
<p>10．“特劳先生，那个教师，”休回答说，“你没看见他在那些晒干草的人里面吗？”休指了指其中一个年长的人，看起来像是这块地的主人。</p>
<p>11．他挽着袖子正在忙碌地干活。大滴的汗水从他的额头渗出，他不停对工人喊叫，让他们趁着天晴快晒干草。很奇怪，这个老农场主的神态和特劳先生还真是一样，这会儿特劳先生可能刚走进教室。</p>
<p>12．“别害怕，”陌生人说，“这不是特劳先生，只是他的一个兄弟，他是个农场主。除非你成了他农场的一个劳力，否则他不会找你麻烦的。”</p>
<p>13．休相信了同伴说的话，他很高兴地离开了这个和老特劳先生长相惊人相似的人。两个人来到一个地方，那里木匠们正在盖房子。休请求同伴等一会儿，因为他看见工匠们用木锯、刨子和锤子认真地工作，这场景很有趣。他开始想象他自己也会喜欢用木锯、刨子和锤子，自己成为一名木匠。但突然，他看到了什么，害怕地抓住了同伴的手。</p>
<p>14．“快点！快！快！”他大叫着，“又是老特劳先生。”休用手指着，陌生人顺着手的方向望去，看见一个上年纪的人，看起来像是监工，在没盖完的房子里走来走去，标出要做的工作，让木匠们赶紧干活。他那严肃而布满皱纹的脸在哪里出现，哪里的木匠就拼命地锤啊锯啊，努力地工作。</p>
<p>15．“哦，不，这不是老特劳先生，”陌生人说，“这是他的另一个弟兄，他是从事木匠工作的。”</p>
<p>16．“听到你这么说我就放心了，”休说，“可是，先生，我还是想快点离开这儿。”</p>

<h2 id="lesson-80-hugh-idle-and-mr.-toilconcluded">LESSON 80 HUGH IDLE
AND MR. TOIL（CONCLUDED）</h2>
<p>休•艾德和特劳先生（结束篇）</p>
<p>1．Now Hugh and the stranger had not gone much further, when they met
a company of soldiers, gayly dressed, with feathers in their caps, and
glittering muskets on their shoulders. In front marched the drummers and
fifers, making such merry music that Hugh would gladly have followed
them to the end of the world. If he were only a soldier, he said to
himself, old Mr. Toil would never venture (1) to look him in the
face.</p>
<p>2．“Quickstep! forward! march!” shouted a gruff voice.</p>
<p>3．Little Hugh started in great dismay (2) ; for this voice sounded
precisely (3) like that which he had heard every day in Mr. Toil’s
schoolroom. And turning his eyes to the captain of the company, what
should he see but the very image of old Mr. Toil himself, in an
officer’s dress, to be sure, but looking as ugly and disagreeable as
ever.</p>
<p>4．“This is certainly old Mr. Toil,” said Hugh, in a trembling voice.
“Let us away, for fear he should make us enlist (4) in his company.”</p>
<p>5．“You are mistaken again, my little friend,” replied the stranger
very composedly (5) . “This is only a brother of Mr. Toil’s, who has
served in the army all his life. You and I need not be afraid of
him.”</p>
<p>6．“Well, well,” said Hugh, “if you please, sir, I don’t want to see
the soldiers any more.” So the child and the stranger resumed (6) their
journey; and, after awhile, they came to a house by the roadside, where
a number of young men and rosy-cheeked girls, with smiles on their
faces, were dancing to the sound of a fiddle.</p>
<p>7．“Oh, let us stop here,” cried Hugh; “Mr. Toil will never dare to
show his face where there is a fiddler, and where people are dancing and
making merry.”</p>
<p>8．But the words had scarcely died away on the little boy’s tongue,
when, happening to cast his eyes on the fiddler, whom should he behold
again but the likeness of Mr. Toil, armed with a fiddle bow this time,
and flourishing it with as much ease and dexterity as if he had been a
fiddler all his life.</p>
<p>9．“Oh, dear me!” whispered he, turning pale; “it seems as if there
were nobody but Mr. Toil in the world.”</p>
<p>10．“This is not your old schoolmaster,” observed (7) the stranger,
“but another brother of his, who has learned to be a fiddler. He is
ashamed of his family, and generally calls himself Master Pleasure; but
his real name is Toil, and those who know him best think him still more
disagreeable than his brothers.”</p>
<p>11．“Pray, let us go on,” said Hugh.</p>
<p>12．Well, thus the two went wandering along the highway and in shady
lanes and through pleasant villages, and wherever they went, behold!
There was the image of old Mr. Toil. If they entered a house, he sat in
the parlor; if they peeped into the kitchen, he was there! He made
himself at home in every cottage, and stole, under one disguise or
another, into the most splendid mansions. Everywhere they stumbled on
some of the old schoolmaster’s innumerable (8) brothers.</p>
<p>13．At length, little Hugh found himself completely worn out with
running away from Mr. Toil. “Take me back! take me back!” cried the poor
fellow, bursting into tears. “If there is nothing but Toil all the world
over, I may just as well go back to the schoolhouse.”</p>
<p>14．“Yonder it is; there is the schoolhouse!” said the stranger; for
though he and little Hugh had taken a great many steps, they had
traveled in a circle instead of a straight line. “Come, we will go back
to the school together.”</p>
<p>15．There was something in his companion’s voice that little Hugh now
remembered; and it is strange that he had not remembered it sooner.
Looking up into his face, behold! there again was the likeness of old
Mr. Toil, so that the poor child had been in company with Toil all day,
even while he had been doing his best to run away from him.</p>
<p>16．Little Hugh Idle, however, had learned a good lesson, and from
that time forward was diligent at his task, because he now knew that
diligence is not a whit more toilsome than sport or idleness. And when
he became better acquainted with Mr. Toil, he began to think his ways
were not so disagreeable, and that the old schoolmaster’s smile of
approbation (9) made his face sometimes appear almost as pleasant as
even that of Hugh’s mother.</p>
<p>EXERCISES.—To whose school was Hugh Idle sent? Why did he run away?
Relate the adventures of Hugh and the stranger. What lesson is taught by
this story?</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-320">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．休和陌生人没走出多远，遇见了一队士兵，他们穿着整齐，帽子上插着羽毛，肩膀上扛着锃锃发亮的滑膛枪。队伍最前面是鼓手和笛子手，他们吹出的音乐如此美妙，休甚至想跟随他们走遍世界。他自言自语，如果他是士兵，特劳先生肯定永远不敢看他一眼。</p>
<p>2．“加快脚步，前进！前进！”一个粗暴的声音喊道。</p>
<p>3．小家伙休吓坏了，因为这个声音听起来跟他每天在特劳先生的教室里听见的一模一样。他转过头去看见了部队的长官，他看见的简直就是老特劳先生本人啊，他穿着军官的衣服，但和他以前一样又丑又不讨人喜欢。</p>
<p>4．“这绝对是老特劳先生，”休的声音颤抖着说，“我们赶紧走吧，万一他让我们加入他的军队。”</p>
<p>5．“你又弄错了，我的小朋友，”陌生人非常冷静地说，“这只是特劳先生的一个兄弟，他一生都在部队参军。你和我都不必害怕他。”</p>
<p>6．“好吧，好吧，”休说，“先生，求您了，我不想再看见这些士兵。”这样，休和陌生人又开始了他们的旅途。过了一会儿，他们来到路边的一间房子里，在这房间里，很多年轻的小伙子和面颊红润的小姑娘，面带微笑，随小提琴演奏翩翩起舞。</p>
<p>7．“哦，我们在这儿歇会儿吧，”休大声说，“小提琴手在这儿演奏，人们高兴地跳着舞，特劳先生肯定不敢出现在这儿的。”</p>
<p>8．这小家伙的话音还没落，他看了一眼小提琴手，竟然又是特劳先生，这次他拿着一把小提琴，熟练地演奏着，仿佛他这一生都是小提琴手。</p>
<p>9．“哦，天哪！”他脸色苍白，小声地说，“好像世界上到处都是特劳先生。”</p>
<p>10．“这不是你的老特劳先生，”陌生人说道，“这是他的另一个兄弟，他成为了一名小提琴手。他以家族的姓氏为耻，所以自称是欢乐先生，但他的真实姓氏还是特劳，了解他的人都知道他比他的弟兄们还要不招人喜欢。”</p>
<p>11．“求你了，我们赶紧走吧。”休说。</p>
<p>12．这样，两个人继续往前走，沿着大路，走过小路，穿过欢乐的村庄，不管他们走到哪儿，看啊，都有老特劳先生的身影。他们走进一间房子，特劳先生就在客厅坐着；他们朝厨房里看，他也在那儿！他出现在每一个村舍，即使是最华丽的住宅，他也装扮成不同的样子偷偷溜进来。总之，无论到那儿，他们总能碰上特劳先生无穷无尽的弟兄中的一个。</p>
<p>13．最后，小家伙休觉得自己实在是精疲力尽，逃脱不了特劳先生了。可怜的小家伙大哭着说：“带我回去，带我回去！如果世界上到处都是特劳先生，我还是回到学校的教室里吧。”</p>
<p>14．“就在那边了，那边就是学校的教室。”陌生人说。因为尽管他和休走了很多路，他们没有走直线，只是绕了一个圈。“来吧，我们一起回学校。”</p>
<p>15．他同伴的声音听起来很熟悉，很奇怪他之前没有想起来。看看同伴的脸，天哪，又是老特劳先生。尽管这个可怜孩子一直在试着逃脱特劳先生，特劳先生一整天都和他在一起。</p>
<p>16．不过，小家伙休学到了很好的一课，从那时起，他学习非常勤奋努力，因为他现在知道了，勤奋并不比偷懒或游戏更辛苦。对特劳先生熟悉了之后，他也开始觉得特劳先生并不是那么让人讨厌，甚至有时候特劳先生不时露出赞赏的笑容，这让他的脸几乎和休的妈妈一样令人快乐。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-81-burning-the-fallow">LESSON 81 BURNING THE FALLOW</h2>
<p>燃烧的土地</p>
<p>Adapted from “Roughing it in the Bush,” a story by Mrs. Susanna
Moodie (sister of Agnes Strickland), who was born in Suffolk, England,
in 1803. She died in 1885.</p>
<p>1．The day was sultry, and towards noon a strong wind sprang up that
roared in the pine tops like the dashing of distant billows, but without
in the least degree abating (1) the heat. The children were lying
listlessly (2) upon the floor, and the girl and I were finishing
sunbonnets, when Mary suddenly exclaimed, “Bless us, mistress, what a
smoke!”</p>
<p>2．I ran immediately to the door, but was not able to distinguish ten
yards before me. The swamp immediately below us was on fire, and the
heavy wind was driving a dense black cloud of smoke directly towards
us.</p>
<p>3．“What can this mean?” I cried. “Who can have set fire to the
fallow (3) ?” As I ceased speaking, John Thomas stood pale and trembling
before me. “John, what is the meaning of this fire?”</p>
<p>4．“Oh, ma’am, I hope you will forgive me; it was I set fire to it,
and I would give all I have in the world if I had not done it.”</p>
<p>5．“What is the danger?”</p>
<p>6．“Oh, I’m afraid that we shall all be burnt up,” said John,
beginning to whimper. “What shall we do?”</p>
<p>7．“Why, we must get out of it as fast as we can, and leave the house
to its fate.”</p>
<p>8．“We can’t get out,” said the man, in a low, hollow tone, which
seemed the concentration (4) of fear; “I would have got out of it if I
could; but just step to the back door, ma’am, and see.”</p>
<p>9．Behind, before, on every side, we were surrounded by a wall of
fire, burning furiously within a hundred yards of us, and cutting off
all possibility of retreat; for, could we have found an opening through
the burning heaps, we could not have seen our way through the dense
canopy (5) of smoke; and, buried as we were in the heart of the forest,
no one could discover our situation till we were beyond the reach of
help.</p>
<p>10．I closed the door, and went back to the parlor. Fear was knocking
loudly at my heart, for our utter helplessness destroyed all hope of our
being able to effect (6) our escape. The girl sat upon the floor by the
children, who, unconscious of the peril that hung over them, had both
fallen asleep. She was silently weeping; while the boy who had caused
the mischief was crying aloud.</p>
<p>11．A strange calm succeeded (7) my first alarm. I sat down upon the
step of the door, and watched the awful scene in silence. The fire was
raging in the cedar swamp immediately below the ridge on which the house
stood, and it presented a spectacle truly appalling (8) .</p>
<p>12．From out of the dense folds of a canopy of black smoke—the
blackest I ever saw—leaped up red forks of lurid (9) flame as high as
the tree tops, igniting (10) the branches of a group of tall pines that
had been left for saw logs. A deep gloom blotted out the heavens from
our sight. The air was filled with fiery particles, which floated even
to the doorstep—while the crackling and roaring of the flames might have
been heard at a great distance.</p>
<p>13．To reach the shore of the lake, we must pass through the burning
swamp, and not a bird could pass over it with unscorched wings. The
fierce wind drove the flames at the sides and back of the house up the
clearing; and our passage to the road or to the forest, on the right and
left, was entirely obstructed by a sea of flames. Our only ark of safety
was the house, so long as it remained untouched by the fire.</p>
<p>14．I turned to young Thomas, and asked him how long he thought that
would he. “When the fire clears this little ridge in front, ma’am. The
Lord have mercy on us then, or we must all go.”</p>
<p>15．I threw myself down on the floor beside my children, and pressed
them to my heart, while inwardly I thanked God that they were asleep,
unconscious of danger, and unable by their cries to distract (11) our
attention from adopting any plan which might offer to effect their
escape.</p>
<p>16．The heat soon became suffocating. We were parched (12) with
thirst, and there was not a drop of water in the house, and none to be
procured nearer than the lake. I turned once more to the door, hoping
that a passage might have been burnt through to the water. I saw nothing
but a dense cloud of fire and smoke—could hear nothing but the crackling
and roaring of flames, which was gaining so fast upon us that I felt
their scorching breath in my face.</p>
<p>17．“Ah,” thought I—and it was a most bitter thought—“what will my
beloved husband say when he returns and finds that his poor wife and his
dear girls have perished in this miserable manner? But God can save us
yet.”</p>
<p>18．The thought had scarcely found a voice in my heart before the
wind rose to a hurricane, scattering the flames on all sides into a
tempest of burning billows. I buried my head in my apron, for I thought
that all was lost, when a most terrific crash of thunder burst over our
heads, and, like the breaking of a waterspout (13) , down came the
rushing torrent of rain which had been pent up for so many weeks.</p>
<p>19．In a few minutes the chip yard was all afloat, and the fire
effectually checked. The storm which, unnoticed by us, had been
gathering all day, and which was the only one of any note we had that
summer, continued to rage all night, and before morning had quite
subdued the cruel enemy whose approach we had viewed with such
dread.</p>

<p>本文节选自《丛林中的艰苦岁月》，由苏珊娜·穆迪（艾格尼丝·斯特里兰克的妹妹）所创作的小说，作者1803年生于英格兰的萨福克。1885年去世。</p>
<p>1．那天天气闷热，快到中午的时候，一阵强风吹来，松树树枝摇曳，仿佛远处掀起了巨浪，但丝毫没有降低炎热的温度。孩子们无精打采地躺在地板上，女孩和我在给正做着的太阳帽收尾，这时，玛丽突然惊叫起来：“上帝保佑，太太，怎么这么大的烟啊？”</p>
<p>2．我立刻跑到门口，眼前十码远的地方什么也看不见。紧挨着我们的沼泽地已经着火了，大风把浓烟直接吹向我们。</p>
<p>3．“这是怎么了？”我惊呼着，“谁能在休耕地放火呢？”这时，约翰·托马斯脸色苍白、浑身颤抖地站在我面前。“约翰，这场火意味着什么？”</p>
<p>4．“噢，太太，希望您能原谅我。是我放的火，真希望我没有这么做，为此让我放弃世上我拥有的一切都愿意。”</p>
<p>5．“有什么危险吗？”</p>
<p>6．“噢，恐怕我们会被烧死，”约翰说着，开始哭泣了，“我们该怎么办啊？”</p>
<p>7．“还能怎么办，我们必须尽快离开这里，房子也只能听天由命了。”</p>
<p>8．“我们逃不走了，”这个男人说着，声音低沉空洞，全是害怕，“如果能逃，我早逃走了。太太，到后门看看吧。”</p>
<p>9．后面，前面，每个方向，火墙把我们包围了，距离我们一百码的地方，大火猛烈地燃烧着，切断了一切逃脱的退路。即使我们能从燃烧的火势中找到突破口，我们在弥漫的浓烟中也找不到方向。另外，我们处于森林深处，没有人会及时发现我们的状况。</p>
<p>10．我关上门，回到客厅里。恐惧敲击着我的心脏，我们彻底绝望了，毫无希望逃脱。女孩坐在地板上挨着孩子们，孩子们还没有意识到他们面临的灭顶之灾，已经睡着了。她在默默地流泪，而导致了这场灾难的男孩在大声哭泣着。</p>
<p>11．一阵惊慌之后，我奇怪地冷静了下来。我坐在门口的台阶上，默默地看着这恐怖的景象。火焰在雪松地里疯狂地燃烧着，紧挨着我们房屋所在的山地，这场景的确让人害怕。</p>
<p>12．浓密的黑烟中火红的火舌跃起到树梢那么高，点燃了被留作锯木用的原木的树枝。浓烟遮挡，我们甚至看不见天。空气中充满着燃烧的颗粒物，甚至飘到了门口的台阶上——火焰燃烧发出的喳喳声和呼啸声从很远就能听得到。</p>
<p>13．要想到达湖岸，我们必须穿过燃烧的沼泽地，连一只鸟想要飞越过去都会烧焦翅膀。狂风吹着火焰，吹向房子旁边和后面的空地。我们通往山路或者森林的路，无论左边还是右边，都已经被凶猛的火焰阻挡了。我们唯一的安全之舟，就是这间房子，这还是在火势不能到达房子的情况下。</p>
<p>14．我转向小托马斯，问他觉得多久会烧到房子。“当火烧光前面这块山地的时候，太太。到时候除非上帝大发仁慈，否则我们都得赶紧离开。”</p>
<p>15．我扑倒在地板上的孩子们旁边，把他们紧紧抱在怀里，内心十分感谢上帝，他们还都睡着，不知道现在的危险状况，也不会哭着分散我们的注意力，而我们计划着如何使他们躲过这场浩劫。</p>
<p>16．热浪很快变得让人窒息。我们又干又渴，房间里一滴水都没有，附近最近的取水的地方就是湖边。我又一次到了门口，希望能够烧出一条通往湖边的路。除了浓浓的烟火，什么也看不到；除了火焰燃烧的噼噼啪啪声和呼啸声，什么也听不到。火焰正迅速向我们接近，我的脸甚至能够感受到火焰的呼吸。</p>
<p>17．“啊！”我想到，这是很残酷的想法，“如果我亲爱的丈夫回来后看到他的妻子和孩子以这样悲惨的方式死去了，他会说什么呢？但是，上帝请拯救我们吧！”</p>
<p>18．我甚至还没来得及想，大风变成了飓风，火焰吹向各个方向，仿佛燃烧的巨浪在翻滚。我把头埋在围裙里，觉得一切都要完了。突然一声惊雷响起，就像水管裂开了，几周来一直等待的大雨倾盆而下。</p>
<p>19．几分钟之内，储存场里的木片全浮起来了，大火也被有效地控制了。我们一直没有注意到，这场暴雨已经酝酿了一整天，这是这个夏天唯一的一场暴雨。这场暴雨持续了整个晚上，在黎明到来前，它终于制服了我们万分恐惧即将到来的残酷敌人。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-82-the-dying-soldiers">LESSON 82 THE DYING SOLDIERS</h2>
<p>垂死的士兵</p>
<p>1．A waste of land, a sodden (1) plain,</p>
<p>A lurid sunset sky,</p>
<p>With clouds that fled and faded fast</p>
<p>In ghostly phantasy (2) ;</p>
<p>A field upturned by trampling feet,</p>
<p>A field uppiled with slain,</p>
<p>With horse and rider blent (3) in death</p>
<p>Upon the battle plain.</p>
<p>2．The dying and the dead lie low;</p>
<p>For them, no more shall rise</p>
<p>The evening moon, nor midnight stars,</p>
<p>Nor day light’s soft surprise:</p>
<p>They will not wake to tenderest call,</p>
<p>Nor see again each home,</p>
<p>Where waiting hearts shall throb and break,</p>
<p>When this day’s tidings (4) come.</p>
<p>3．Two soldiers, lying as they fell</p>
<p>Upon the reddened clay—</p>
<p>In daytime, foes; at night, in peace</p>
<p>Breathing their lives away!</p>
<p>Brave hearts had stirred each manly breast;</p>
<p>Fate only, made them foes;</p>
<p>And lying, dying, side by side,</p>
<p>A softened feeling rose.</p>
<p>4．“Our time is short,” one faint voice said;</p>
<p>“To-day we’ve done our best</p>
<p>On different sides: what matters now?</p>
<p>To-morrow we shall rest!</p>
<p>Life lies behind. I might not care</p>
<p>For only my own sake;</p>
<p>But far away are other hearts,</p>
<p>That this day’s work will break.</p>
<p>5．“Among New Hampshire’s snowy hills,</p>
<p>There pray for me to-night</p>
<p>A woman, and a little girl</p>
<p>With hair like golden light;”</p>
<p>And at the thought, broke forth, at last,</p>
<p>The cry of anguish (5) wild,</p>
<p>That would not longer be repressed (6) —</p>
<p>“O God, my wife, my child!”</p>
<p>6．“And,” said the other dying man,</p>
<p>“Across the Georgia plain,</p>
<p>There watch and wait for me loved ones</p>
<p>I ne’er shall see again:</p>
<p>A little girl, with dark, bright eyes,</p>
<p>Each day waits at the door;</p>
<p>Her father’s step, her father’s kiss,</p>
<p>Will never greet her more.</p>
<p>7．“To-day we sought each other’s lives:</p>
<p>Death levels all that now;</p>
<p>For soon before God’s mercy seat</p>
<p>Together we shall bow.</p>
<p>Forgive each other while we may;</p>
<p>Life’s but a weary game,</p>
<p>And, right or wrong, the morning sun</p>
<p>Will find us, dead, the same.”</p>
<p>8．The dying lips the pardon (7) breathe;</p>
<p>The dying hands entwine (8) ;</p>
<p>The last ray fades, and over all</p>
<p>The stars from heaven shine;</p>
<p>And the little girl with golden hair,</p>
<p>And one with dark eyes bright,</p>
<p>On Hampshire’s hills, and Georgia’s plain,</p>
<p>Were fatherless that night!</p>
<p>EXERCISE.—What do the first two stanzas describe? What does the
third? What did one soldier say to the other? Where was his home? What
friends had he there? Where was the home of the other soldier? Who
waited for him? Did they forgive each other?</p>

<h2 id="lesson-83-the-attack-on-nymwegen">LESSON 83 THE ATTACK ON
NYMWEGEN</h2>
<p>偷袭纳梅亨</p>
<p>From “The History of the United Netherlands,” by John Lothrop Motley,
who was born in 1814, at Dorchester, Mass. He graduated at Harvard in
1831, and afterwards lived many years In Europe, writing the histories
which made him famous. He died in 1877.</p>
<p>1．On the evening of the 10th of August, 1589, there was a wedding
feast in one of the splendid mansions of the stately city. The
festivities were prolonged until deep in the midsummer’s night, and harp
and viol were still inspiring the feet of the dancers, when on a sudden,
in the midst of the holiday groups, appeared the grim visage of Martin
Schenk, the man who never smiled.</p>
<p>2．Clad in no wedding garment, but in armor of proof, with morion (1)
on head, and sword in hand, the great freebooter (2) strode heavily
through the ballroom, followed by a party of those terrible musketeers
(3) who never gave or asked for quarter (4) , while the affrighted
revelers fluttered away before them.</p>
<p>3．Taking advantage of a dark night, he had just dropped down the
river from his castle, with five and twenty barges, had landed with his
most trusted soldiers in the foremost vessels, had battered down the
gate of St. Anthony, and surprised and slain the guard.</p>
<p>4．Without waiting for the rest of his boats, he had then stolen with
his comrades through the silent streets, and torn away the latticework,
and other slight defenses on the rear of the house which they had now
entered, and through which they intended to possess themselves of the
market place.</p>
<p>5．Martin had long since selected this mansion as a proper position
for his enterprise, but he had not been bidden to the wedding, and was
somewhat disconcerted when he found himself on the festive scene which
he had so grimly interrupted.</p>
<p>6．Some of the merrymakers escaped from the house, and proceeded to
alarm the town; while Schenk hastily fortified his position, and took
possession of the square. But the burghers (5) and garrison (6) were
soon on foot, and he was driven back into the house.</p>
<p>7．Three times he recovered the square by main strength of his own
arm, seconded by the handful of men whom he had brought with him, and
three times he was beaten back by overwhelming numbers into the wedding
mansion.</p>
<p>8．The arrival of the greater part of his followers, with whose
assistance he could easily have mastered the city in the first moments
of surprise, was mysteriously delayed. He could not account for their
prolonged absence, and was meanwhile supported only by those who had
arrived with him in the foremost barges.</p>
<p>9．The truth—of which he was ignorant—was, that the remainder of the
flotilla (7) , borne along by the strong and deep current of the Waal,
then in a state of freshet, had shot past the landing place, and had
ever since been vainly struggling against wind and tide to force their
way back to the necessary point.</p>
<p>10．Meantime Schenk and his followers fought desperately in the
market place, and desperately in the house which he had seized. But a
whole garrison, and a town full of citizens in arms proved too much for
him, and he was now hotly besieged in the mansion, and at last driven
forth into the streets.</p>
<p>11．By this time day was dawning, the whole population, soldiers and
burghers, men, women, and children, were thronging about the little band
of marauders (8) , and assailing them with every weapon and every
missile to be found. Schenk fought with his usual ferocity, but at last
the musketeers, in spite of his indignant commands, began rapidly to
retreat toward the quay (9) .</p>
<p>12．In vain Martin stormed and cursed, in vain with his own hand he
struck more than one of his soldiers dead. He was swept along with the
panic-stricken band, and when, shouting and gnashing his teeth with
frenzy, he reached the quay at last, he saw at a glance why his great
enterprise had failed.</p>
<p>13．The few empty barges of his own party were moored at the steps;
the rest were half a mile off, contending hopelessly against the swollen
and rapid Waal. Schenk, desperately wounded, was left almost alone upon
the wharf, for his routed followers had plunged helter-skelter into the
boats, several of which, overladen in the panic, sank at once, leaving
the soldiers to drown or struggle with the waves.</p>
<p>14．The game was lost. Nothing was left the freebooter but retreat.
Reluctantly turning his back on his enemies, now in full cry close
behind him, Schenk sprang into the last remaining boat just pushing from
the quay. Already overladen, it foundered (10) with his additional
weight, and Martin Schenk, encumbered (11) with his heavy armor, sank at
once to the bottom of the Waal.</p>
<p>15．Some of the fugitives succeeded in swimming down the stream, and
were picked up by their comrades in the barges below the town, and so
made their escape. Many were drowned with their captain. A few days
afterward, the inhabitants of Nymwegen fished up the body of the famous
partisan (12) . He was easily recognized by his armor, and by his
truculent (13) face, still wearing the scowl with which he had last
rebuked his followers.</p>

<p>1．在1589年8月10日的傍晚，在这个伟大城市的一座富丽堂皇的大厦里正举办一场婚宴。庆祝活动一直持续到仲夏深夜，人们伴随着竖琴和六弦提琴演奏的音乐翩翩起舞。突然，在欢庆的人群中，出现了一张阴暗的脸，是马丁·申克，他从来没有笑过。</p>
<p>2．他没有穿婚礼服饰，而是穿上了盔甲，头上戴着头盔，手执宝剑，这个强盗步履沉重地穿过舞厅，后面跟着一队恐怖的火枪手，狂欢着的人们受了惊，慌忙逃走了。</p>
<p>3．趁着夜色正浓，二十五条驳船从城堡潜入河中，驳船最前方是他最信赖的士兵，他们猛击圣安东尼的大门，出其不意地杀死了守门的卫士。</p>
<p>4．没有等待其余的船只，他和他的战友们潜入安静的大街小巷，破坏了屋后的栅栏和其他无足轻重的防御设施，进入了现在这间屋子，他们想要通过这里占领整个市场。</p>
<p>5．马丁早就把这栋大厦作为行动的根据地，但他没有接到婚礼的邀请，他发现自己很不识时务地打断了婚礼的欢乐场景，也觉得挺惊慌的。</p>
<p>6．一些寻欢作乐的人们从房子里逃了出去，开始向全镇发出警报。而申克急忙巩固他的根据地，并占领了广场。但是，镇上的居民和士兵很快聚集过来，又把他赶回了房子里。</p>
<p>7．凭借他自己的武装力量，和他带来的一小部分人，他三次占领广场，但又三次被人数众多的敌人赶回了举办婚礼的大厦。</p>
<p>8．如果他的后续部队到了，在他们的帮助下，他可以轻而易举出其不意地占领这座城市，但他们不知为何迟迟未到。他没有办法依靠这些没来的人，只能依靠先到的几只驳船一起进行抵抗。</p>
<p>9．事实的真相是他所不知道的，其余的驳船受瓦尔河湍急的河流冲击，在洪水中，错过了着陆地点，后来只能徒劳地和风浪抗争，试图回到原来的着陆地点。</p>
<p>10．同时，申克和他的跟随者们在市场绝望地抗争着，在他们占据的大厦里几乎要绝望了。但是，全体卫戍部队和武装起来的市民对他们来说太多了，焦急的他被困在了大厦里，最后被赶到了大街上。</p>
<p>11．这时天已经亮了，所有的人，士兵和市民，男人和女人，甚至孩子，紧紧地包围着这个入侵的小部队，用能找到的所有武器向他们攻击。申克用他一贯的凶猛对抗着，但是，尽管他不停发出命令，他的士兵们还是开始快速向码头撤退了。</p>
<p>12．尽管申克咆哮、咒骂，还亲手杀死了不只一个士兵，还是无济于事。尽管他愤怒地大声喊叫，咬牙切齿，他还是被恐慌的士兵裹带着到了码头，看了一眼，他就明白了为什么大队人马没有赶到的原因。</p>
<p>13．几只空驳船系在踏板上，剩下的在一英里之外，无望地对抗着洪流和湍急的瓦尔河。码头上只剩下受伤的申克一人，非常绝望。溃败的随从慌乱地跳进船上，惊慌失措中由于分量太重，几艘船立刻沉了下去，士兵们在巨浪中挣扎着被淹没。</p>
<p>14．最终失败了。这个强盗除了撤退别无选择。申克不情愿地转过身去，身后是步步紧逼的敌人，他跳上仅存的最后一艘船。这艘船已经超载了，增加了额外重量之后，迅速沉了下去。马丁·申克，穿着厚重的盔甲，很快沉到了瓦尔河底。</p>
<p>15．一些逃兵成功地沿着河水游到下游，被下游驳船上的同伙救了上来，成功逃脱。很多人和他们的将领一起，溺死河中。几天之后，纳梅亨的居民捞上了这个著名强盗的尸体。从所穿的盔甲和阴冷的面孔，很容易能分辨出来是申克，他还带着责备跟随者时暴怒的样子。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-85-brandywine-ford">LESSON 85 BRANDYWINE FORD</h2>
<p>布兰迪万河浅滩</p>
<p>Bayard Taylor was born at Kennett Square, Penn., in 1825. He received
a limited school education, but at an early age displayed great energy
and talent. He was a great traveler, and a fluent, graceful writer, both
of prose and verse. Mr. Taylor held high official positions under the
government. The following selection is adapted from “The Story of
Kennett,” He died in 1878.</p>
<p>1．The black, dreary night, seemed interminable (1) . He could only
guess, here and there, at a landmark, and was forced to rely more upon
Roger’s instinct of the road than upon the guidance of his senses.
Toward midnight, as he judged, by the solitary crow of a cock, the rain
almost entirely ceased.</p>
<p>2．The wind began to blow sharp and keen, and the hard vault of the
sky to lift a little. He fancied that the hills on his right had fallen
away, and that the horizon was suddenly depressed (2) towards the north.
Roger’s feet began to splash in constantly deepening water, and
presently a roar, distinct from that of the wind, filled the air.</p>
<p>3．It was the Brandywine. The stream had overflowed its broad meadow
bottoms, and was running high and fierce beyond its main channel. The
turbid (3) waters made a dim, dusky gleam around him; soon the fences
disappeared, and the flood reached to his horse’s body.</p>
<p>4．But he knew that the ford could be distinguished by the break in
the fringe of timber; moreover, that the creek bank was a little higher
than the meadows behind it, and so far, at least, he might venture. The
ford was not more than twenty yards across, and he could trust Roger to
swim that distance.</p>
<p>5．The faithful animal pressed bravely on, but Gilbert soon noticed
that he seemed at fault. The swift water had forced him out of the road,
and he stopped from time to time, as if anxious and uneasy. The timber
could now be discerned (4) , only a short distance in advance, and in a
few minutes they would gain the bank.</p>
<p>6．What was that? A strange, rustling, hissing sound, as of cattle
trampling through dry reeds,—a sound which quivered and shook, even in
the breath of the hurrying wind! Roger snorted, stood still, and
trembled in every limb; and a sensation of awe and terror struck a chill
through Gilbert’s heart. The sound drew swiftly nearer, and became a
wild, seething (5) roar, filling the whole breadth of the valley.</p>
<p>7．“The dam! the dam!” cried Gilbert, “the dam has given way!” He
turned Roger’s head, gave him the rein, struck, spurred, cheered, and
shouted. The brave beast struggled through the impeding (6) flood, but
the advance wave of the coming inundation (7) already touched his side.
He staggered; a line of churning foam bore down upon them, the terrible
roar was all around and over them, and horse and rider were whirled
away.</p>
<p>8．What happened during the first few seconds, Gilbert could never
distinctly recall. Now they were whelmed in the water, now riding its
careering tide, torn through the tops of brushwood, jostled by floating
logs and timbers of the dam, but always, as it seemed, remorselessly
held in the heart of the tumult and the ruin.</p>
<p>9．He saw at last that they had fallen behind the furious onset (8)
of the flood, but Roger was still swimming with it, desperately throwing
up his head from time to time, and snorting the water from his nostrils.
All his efforts to gain a foothold failed; his strength was nearly
spent, and unless some help should come in a few minutes it would come
in vain. And in the darkness, and the rapidity with which they were
borne along, how should help come?</p>
<p>10．All at once Roger’s course stopped. He became an obstacle to the
flood, which pressed him against some other obstacle below, and rushed
over horse and rider. Thrusting out his hand, Gilbert felt the rough
bark of a tree. Leaning towards it, and clasping the log in his arms, he
drew himself from the saddle, while Roger, freed from his burden,
struggled into the current and instantly disappeared.</p>
<p>11．As nearly as Gilbert could ascertain, several timbers, thrown
over each other, had lodged, probably upon a rocky islet in the stream,
the uppermost one projecting slantingly out of the flood. It required
all his strength to resist the current which sucked, and whirled, and
tugged at his body, and to climb high enough to escape its force,
without overbalancing his support. At last, though still half immerged
(9) , he found himself comparatively safe for a time, yet as far as ever
from a final rescue.</p>
<p>12．Yet a new danger now assailed him, from the increasing cold.
There was already a sting of frost, a breath of ice, in the wind. In
another hour the sky was nearly swept bare of clouds, and he could note
the lapse (10) of the night by the sinking of the moon. But he was by
this time hardly in a condition to note anything more.</p>

<p>1．黑暗、阴沉的夜晚似乎没有尽头。他只能通过路标来猜测身处何地，被迫更多地依靠罗杰的本能来认路，而不是依靠自己的感觉。接近午夜，他听到一只公鸡孤独的啼叫声，心想雨快要停了。</p>
<p>2．风变得越来越急、越来越猛，似乎把天穹划开了一个口。他感觉右边的山峦变远了，地平线也向北方移动。罗杰的蹄子在越来越深的水里溅起水花，它时不时嘶叫一声，和风的呼啸一起充斥耳边。</p>
<p>3．这就是布兰迪万河。河水已经漫过宽阔的低洼地带，在主河道之外湍急猛烈地流淌着。浑浊的河水在他周围闪烁着黯淡的光，围栏很快不见了，洪水漫过他的马背。</p>
<p>4．但他知道浅滩还是可以通过围栏的缝隙分辨出来。另外，河水两岸比身后的低洼处要高，这样，他至少可以冒险渡过。浅滩只有不到二十码宽，他相信罗杰一定能够游过去。</p>
<p>5．忠诚的罗杰勇敢地奋力向前游，不过吉尔伯特很快意识到自己错了。湍急的水流使它离开原路，它只好时不时停下来，焦虑又不安。现在能够看到围栏边缘，就在前方，距离并不远，不用一会儿他们就能到达河岸。</p>
<p>6．那是什么？一种奇怪的嘶嘶声传来，仿佛牛群踏过干燥的土地——这个声音令人震颤，即使在这样的狂风中也是如此。罗杰鼻子喷着气，站住不动了，四肢瑟瑟发抖，吉尔伯特感觉到了恐惧和害怕，打了个寒战。声音很快越来越近，变成疯狂野蛮的呼啸，响彻山谷。</p>
<p>7．“是大坝，大坝！”吉尔伯特大叫，“大坝决口了！”他掉转马头，拉紧缰绳，用力拍打、喊叫，给马使劲。这匹勇敢的马在湍急的洪水里挣扎着，但涌来一个大浪，洪水涨到马的身体之上。它踉跄着。一阵漩涡袭来，四周都是可怕的咆哮声。马和骑手都被卷走了。</p>
<p>8．最初的几秒发生了什么，吉尔伯特已经想不起来了。现在他们已经完全被水淹没了，跟随波浪上下起伏。身边是漂浮的木柴，不停被漂浮的圆木和大坝的木材撞击着，就这样被无情地困在洪流和杂物之间。</p>
<p>9．最后，他看见他们落在了洪峰后面，但罗杰还跟随洪水游着，时不时绝望地抬起头来，打几个响鼻。想要找个地方立住脚，却一直没有成功。它几乎用尽了力气，除非有人及时赶来救援，否则一切努力都是徒劳的。但是，在这黑夜里，洪水湍急，谁又会来救他们呢？</p>
<p>10．突然之间罗杰停了下来。他成为洪水的阻碍，洪水把他冲到下面的一个阻碍物上，漫过了马和骑手。奋力伸出手，吉尔伯特摸到了粗糙的树干。他向树靠近，双臂抱紧树干，从马鞍上站起身来。而罗杰没有了负担，被洪流卷走，立刻消失了。</p>
<p>11．正如吉尔伯特想到的，可能在河水中一个突起的岩石上，几根木材摞在一起，互相绊住了，最上面那根斜着伸出了水面。他用尽全身力气抵抗洪水的冲击和漩涡，他努力向上爬来摆脱河水的冲击，还要提防大树失去平衡。最后，尽管还是淹没了半个身体，他总算暂时安全了，可是离最后获救还很远。</p>
<p>12．可是这时一个新的危险袭来——天越来越冷。风也带着寒霜和冰的气息。一个小时后，天空中几乎没有云了，看着月亮越来越低，他知道夜晚即将过去。可是这时他已经没法注意更多东西了。</p>

FORD（CONCLUDED）</h2>
<p>布兰迪万河浅滩（结束篇）</p>
<p>1．The moon was low in the west, and there was a pale glimmer of the
coming dawn in the sky, when Gilbert Potter suddenly raised his head.
Above the noise of the water and the whistle of the wind, he heard a
familiar sound,—the shrill, sharp neigh of a horse. Lifting himself with
great exertion, to a sitting posture, he saw two men, on horseback, in
the flooded meadow, a little below him. They stopped, seemed to consult,
and presently drew nearer.</p>
<p>2．Gilbert tried to shout, but the muscles of his throat were stiff,
and his lungs refused to act. The horse neighed again. This time there
was no mistake; it was Roger that he heard! Voice came to him, and he
cried aloud,—a hoarse, strange, unnatural cry.</p>
<p>The horsemen heard it, and rapidly pushed up the bank, until they
reached a point directly opposite to him. The prospect (1) of escape
brought a thrill of life to his frame; he looked around and saw that the
flood had indeed fallen.</p>
<p>3．“We have no rope,” he heard one of the men say. “How shall we
reach him?”</p>
<p>“There is no time to get one now,” the other answered. “My horse is
stronger than yours. I’ll go into the creek just below, where it’s
broader and not so deep, and work my way up to him,”</p>
<p>“But one horse can’t carry both.”</p>
<p>“His will follow, be sure, when it sees me.”</p>
<p>4．As the last speaker moved away, Gilbert saw a led horse plunging
through the water beside the other. It was a difficult and dangerous
undertaking. The horseman and the loose horse entered the main stream
below, where its divided channel met and broadened, but it was still
above the saddle girths, and very swift.</p>
<p>5．Sometimes the animals plunged, losing their foothold;
nevertheless, they gallantly breasted (2) the current, and inch by inch
worked their way to a point about six feet below Gilbert. It seemed
impossible to approach nearer.</p>
<p>“Can you swim?” asked the man.</p>
<p>Gilbert shook his head. “Throw me the end of Roger’s bridle!” he then
cried.</p>
<p>6．The man unbuckled the bridle and threw it, keeping the end of the
rein in his hand. Gilbert tried to grasp it, but his hands were too numb
(3) . He managed, however, to get one arm and his head through the
opening, and relaxed (4) his hold on the log.</p>
<p>7．A plunge, and the man had him by the collar. He felt himself
lifted by a strong arm and laid across Roger’s saddle. With his failing
strength and stiff limbs, it was no slight task to get into place; and
the return, though less laborious to the horses, was equally dangerous,
because Gilbert was scarcely able to support himself without help.</p>
<p>“You’re safe now,” said the man, when they reached the bank, “but
it’s a downright mercy of God that you’re alive!”</p>
<p>8．The other horseman joined them, and they rode slowly across the
flooded meadow. They had both thrown their cloaks around Gilbert, and
carefully steadied him in the saddle, one on each side. He was too much
exhausted to ask how they had found him, or whither they were taking
him,—too numb for curiosity, almost for gratitude.</p>
<p>9．“Here’s your savior!” said one of the men, patting Roger’s
shoulder. “It was through him that we found you. Do you wish to know
how? Well—about three o’clock it was, maybe a little earlier, maybe a
little later, my wife woke me up. ‘Do you hear that?’ she said.”</p>
<p>10．“I listened and heard a horse in the lane before the door,
neighing,—I can’t tell you exactly how it was,—as though he would call
up the house. It was rather queer, I thought, so I got up and looked out
of the window, and it seemed to me he had a saddle on. He stamped, and
pawed, and then he gave another neigh, andstamped again.”</p>
<p>11．“Said I to my wife, ‘There is something wrong here,’ and I
dressed and went out. When he saw me, he acted in the strangest way you
ever saw; thought I, if ever an animal wanted to speak, that animal
does. When I tried to catch him, he shot off, ran down the lane a bit,
and then came back acting as strangely as ever.”</p>
<p>12．“I went into the house and woke up my brother, here, and we
saddled our horses and started. Away went yours ahead, stopping every
minute to look around and see if we followed. When we came to the water
I rather hesitated, but it was of no use; the horse would have us go on
and on, till we found you. I never heard of such a thing before, in all
my life.” Gilbert did not speak, but two large tears slowly gathered in
his eyes, and rolled down his cheeks. The men saw his emotion (5) , and
respected it.</p>
<p>13．In the light of the cold, keen dawn, they reached a snug
farmhouse, a mile from the Brandywine. The men lifted Gilbert from the
saddle, and would have carried him immediately into the house, but he
first leaned upon Roger’s neck, took the faithful creature’s head in his
arms, and kissed it.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-326">中文阅读</h4>
<p>1．月亮西斜，天空中闪烁着清晨的微光。吉尔伯特·波特突然抬起了头。在水的流淌声和呼啸的风声之间，他听见了一个熟悉的声音——马的高声嘶鸣。他努力抬起身，坐了起来。他看见在被洪水没过的低洼地上有两个人骑在马背上。他们停下来，仿佛在商量着什么，很快朝他骑过来了。</p>
<p>2．吉尔伯特想要呼救，但他的喉部肌肉僵硬，肺部氧气不足。马又嘶叫了一声。这次没错，他听见的就是罗杰。他终于可以喊出声了，大声叫了出来——沙哑、奇怪、不自然的喊声。</p>
<p>骑马的人听到喊声，很快跑上河岸，到了他的对面。获救的希望使他浑身兴奋起来，他环顾一周，发现洪水已经渐渐退去。</p>
<p>3．“我们没有绳子，”他听见一个人说，“我们怎么才能够到他？”</p>
<p>“我们没有时间去取绳子了，”另一个人说，“我的马比你的强壮，我到下面的河里去，那边宽一点，但没有这么深，然后渐渐走到他身边。”</p>
<p>“但是，一匹马驮不动两个人。”</p>
<p>“他的马会跟着来，我确定，它看见我就会跟着来。”</p>
<p>4．后来说话的人走过来后，吉尔伯特看见一匹马趟过水，走在另一匹马旁边。这是一次艰难危险的历程。骑手和马进入了下方河流的主干道，这里两股水流相交，河道变宽，但河面仍然漫过马鞍，并且水流非常湍急。</p>
<p>5．有时马会陷进去，失去平衡，但它们勇敢地和水流斗争，一步一步走到了吉尔伯特下游六英尺的地方。仿佛没有办法再走近了。</p>
<p>“你还能游吗？”这个男人问。</p>
<p>吉尔伯特摇了摇头，然后大声说：“把罗杰的缰绳扔给我。”</p>
<p>6．这个人解开缰绳扔给他，另一头抓在他手里。吉尔伯特想要抓住缰绳，可他的手已经麻木了。不过他最终把一个胳膊和头穿过缰绳的圆口，松开了他一直抱着的圆木。</p>
<p>7．向前一跨，那个男人抓住了他的衣领。他觉得自己被强有力的手臂举起，放在了罗杰的鞍子上。他的力量越来越弱，四肢麻木，要想坐稳不是件容易的事。回去的路上，虽然马不太费劲，但也同样很危险，如果没有人帮忙，吉尔伯特几乎没有力量坐好。</p>
<p>“你现在安全了，”他们到岸上的时候那个男人说，“但是，你能够活下来真的是上帝的仁慈啊。”</p>
<p>8．另一个骑马的人和他们一起，慢慢地骑马走过被洪水淹没的低洼地。他们把自己的外衣给吉尔伯特披上，一边一个人扶着他，让他稳稳坐在马鞍上。他太累了，也没有问他们是怎么发现他的，也没问他们要把他带到哪儿——他已经冻得麻木了，顾不上好奇和表达感激之情。</p>
<p>9．“这是你的救命恩人。”一个男人拍着罗杰的背说，“我们是通过它才发现你的。你想知道是怎么回事吗？是这样的——大约三点的时候，可能早一点儿，也可能晚一点儿，我的妻子把我叫醒了。’听见了吗？’她问我。”</p>
<p>10．“我听了听，听见一匹马在门前的小路上嘶叫着，我也说不清楚是怎么叫的，仿佛它要把房子掀了似的。我觉得它很奇怪，就起来朝窗户外面看，似乎它的背上有马鞍。它不停地蹬蹄子、挠地，时不时嘶叫一声，然后又开始蹬蹄子。”</p>
<p>11．“我对我妻子说：’肯定发生什么事了。’我穿上衣服走了出去。看见我之后，它的表现简直奇怪极了。我就想，如果动物想要说话，这匹马一定是想要说话。我想要抓住它，它却跑开了，然后返回来，动作像刚才一样很奇怪。”</p>
<p>12．“我回到家叫醒了我兄弟，然后，我们骑上自己的马出发了。你的马在前面带路，时不时停下来看看我们是否还跟着。到水边的时候我很犹豫，但没有用。这匹马让我们不停地走啊走，直到我们发现了你。我这一生从来都没有听说过这样的事。”吉尔伯特没有说话，但双眼含泪，泪水顺着脸颊流了下来。两个男人看他动了感情，都很敬重他。</p>
<p>13．在清晨寒冷的阳光中，他们来到了一个温暖舒适的农家，离布兰迪万河大概有一英里远。两个男人把吉尔伯特从马鞍抬下来，本来要立刻把他送进屋子里，可他先是靠在罗杰的脖子上，双臂紧紧抱着他忠诚的马的头，亲了一下。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-87-the-best-capital">LESSON 87 THE BEST CAPITAL</h2>
<p>最好的资本</p>
<p>Louisa May Alcott was born at Germantown, Pa., in 1833, and, among
other works, wrote many beautiful stories for children. During the Civil
War she was a hospital nurse at Washington. The following selection is
adapted from “Little Men.” She died in 1888.</p>
<p>1．One would have said that modest John Brooke, in his busy, quiet,
humble life, had had little time to make friends; but now they seemed to
start up everywhere,—old and young, rich and poor, high and low; for all
unconsciously his influence had made itself widely felt, his virtues
were remembered, and his hid den charities rose up to bless him.</p>
<p>2．The group about his coffin was a far more elo quent eulogy (1)
than any that man could utter. There were the rich men whom he had
served faithfully for years; the poor old women whom he cherished (2)
with his little store, in memory of his mother; the wife to whom he had
given such happiness that death could not mar it utterly; the brothers
and sisters in whose hearts he had made a place forever; the little son
and daughter who already felt the loss of his strong arm and tender
voice; the young children, sobbing for their kindest playmate, and the
tall lads, watching with softened faces a scene which they never could
forget.</p>
<p>3．That evening, as the Plumfield boys sat on the steps, as usual, in
the mild September moonlight, they naturally fell to talking of the
event of the day.</p>
<p>Emil began by breaking out in his impetuous way, “Uncle Fritz is the
wisest, and Uncle Laurie the jolliest, but Uncle John was the best; and
I’d rather be like him than any man I ever saw.”</p>
<p>4．“So would I. Did you hear what those gentle men said to Grandpa
to-day? I would like to have that said of me when I was dead;” and Franz
felt with regret that he had not appreciated (3) Uncle John enough.</p>
<p>“What did they say?” asked Jack, who had been much impressed by the
scenes of the day.</p>
<p>5．“Why, one of the partners of Mr. Laurence, where Uncle John has
been ever so long, was saying that he was conscientious (4) almost to a
fault as a business man, and above reproach in all things. Another
gentleman said no money could repay the fidelity and honesty with which
Uncle John had served him, and then Grandpa told them the best of
all.</p>
<p>6．“Uncle John once had a place in the office of a man who cheated,
and when this man wanted uncle to help him do it, uncle wouldn’t, though
he was offered a big salary. The man was angry, and said, ‘You will
never get on in business with such strict principles;’ and uncle
answered back, ‘I never will try to get on without them,’ and left the
place for a much harder and poorer one.”</p>
<p>7．“Good!” cried several of the boys warmly, for they were in the
mood (5) to understand and value the little story as never before.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t rich, was he?” asked Jack.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“He never did anything to make a stir in the world, did he?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“He was only good?”</p>
<p>“That’s all;” and Franz found himself wishing that Uncle</p>
<p>John had done something to boast of, for it was evident that</p>
<p>Jack was disappointed by his replies.</p>
<p>8．“Only good. That is all and everything,” said Uncle Fritz, who had
overheard the last few words, and guessed what was going on in the minds
of the lads.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you a little about John Brooke, and you will see why men
honor him, and why he was satisfied to be good rather than rich or
famous. He simply did his duty in all things, and did it so cheerfully,
so faithfully, that it kept him patient, brave, and happy, through
poverty and loneliness and years of hard work.</p>
<p>9．“He was a good son, and gave up his own plans to stay and live
with his mother while she needed him. He was a good friend, and taught
your Uncle Laurie much beside his Greek and Latin, did it unconsciously,
perhaps, by showing him an example of an upright man.</p>
<p>10．“He was a faithful servant, and made himself so valuable to those
who employed him that they will find it hard to fill his place. He was a
good husband and father, so tender, wise, and thoughtful, that Laurie
and I le arned much of him, and only knew how well he loved his family
when we discovered all he had done for them, unsuspected and
unassisted.”</p>
<p>11．Uncle Fritz stopped a minute, and the boys sat like statues in
the moonlight until he went on again, in a subdued (6) and earnest
voice: “As he lay dying, I said to him, ‘Have no care for your wife and
the little ones; I will see that they never want.’ Then he smiled and
pressed my hand, and answered, in his cheerful way, ‘No need of that; I
have cared for them.’”</p>
<p>12．“And so he had, for when we looked among his papers, all was in
order,—not a debt remained; and safely put away was enough to keep his
wife comfortable and independent (7) . Then we knew why he had lived so
plainly, denied himself so many pleasures, except that of charity, and
worked so hard that I fear he shortened his good life.</p>
<p>13．“He never asked help for himself, though often for others, but
bore his own burden and worked out his own task bravely and quietly. No
one can say a word of complaint against him, so just and generous and
kind was he; and now, when he is gone, all find so much to love and
praise and honor, that I am proud to have been his friend, and would
rather leave my children the legacy (8) he leaves his than the largest
fortune ever made.</p>
<p>14．“Yes! simple, genuine goodness is the best capital (9) to found
the business of this life upon. It lasts when fame and money fail, and
is the only riches we can take out of this world with us. Remember that,
my boys; and, if you want to earn respect and confidence and love,
follow in the footsteps of John Brooke.”</p>

<p>作者路易莎·梅·奥尔科特，于1833年出生在宾夕法尼亚州的德国镇。除了其他作品，还写了很多儿童故事。内战期间，她在华盛顿医院做护士。本文改编自《小男子汉》。她死于1888年。</p>
<p>1．有人可能会说，诚实的约翰·布鲁克，在他繁忙、安静又平凡的一生中，几乎没有时间交朋友。但是，现在他的朋友从各个地方出现了——老人和孩子，富人和穷人，高的和矮的——因为人们不知不觉地受到了他的影响，记起了他的美德，而他默默的善行也给自己带来了祝福。</p>
<p>2．他棺材周围的人流比颂词都要顺畅。有他曾经忠诚侍奉了多年的富人；他用自己的小商店照顾过的贫困老妇人，为了纪念自己的母亲；有他的妻子，他给她带来的幸福就连死亡也带不走；有他的兄弟姐妹，在他们的心里，他永远有一席之地；有他的儿女，他们已经感到了失去父亲强壮的臂弯和柔和的话语；有年轻的孩子们，为他和蔼可亲的玩伴哭泣，大一点的孩子们面色温和地看着这永远不会忘记的一幕。</p>
<p>3．那天傍晚，在九月皎洁的月光下，梅园的男孩们像往常一样坐在台阶上，很自然地开始谈论当天发生的事情。</p>
<p>埃米尔以他急躁的方式打开了话题：“弗里茨叔叔是最聪明的，劳里叔叔是最欢乐的，但约翰叔叔是最好的。在我见过的所有人里，我最愿意成为他这样的人。”</p>
<p>4．“我也是。今天你们听到那些绅士们对祖父说的话了吗？我也希望我死的时候人们能这么说我。”弗朗茨很遗憾自己以前对约翰叔叔敬仰得不够。</p>
<p>“他们说什么了？”杰克问。他也深深地记住了今天的场景。</p>
<p>5．“劳伦斯先生的一个合伙人和叔叔共事过很长时间，他说约翰叔叔作为商人的公正和认真几乎到了挑剔的地步，做什么事情都无可指责。另一个先生说多少财富也买不来约翰叔叔服务时的忠诚和诚实，然后爷爷讲了约翰叔叔一件了不起的事。</p>
<p>6．“约翰叔叔曾经在某人的公司做事，那个人曾经做过骗人的事，当这个人要求叔叔帮助他骗人的时候，尽管可以支付一大笔工资，叔叔还是拒绝了。那个人很生气，说：’以你这样耿直的性格，你在商业上不会成功的。’然后，叔叔回答他：’我不会放弃原则来取得成功。’然后他离开了那儿，从事了一份更艰苦、收入更少的工作。”</p>
<p>7．“真厉害！”几个男孩子兴奋地叫着，因为他们了解了这个故事的价值。</p>
<p>“他不富有，是吧？”杰克说。</p>
<p>“是的，不富。”</p>
<p>“他从来没有做什么惊天动地的大事，对吧？”</p>
<p>“对。”</p>
<p>“他只是个好人吗？”</p>
<p>“完全如此。”弗朗茨发现他希望能想起约翰叔叔做过什么值得吹嘘的事，因为很显然杰克对他的回复有点失望。</p>
<p>8．“只是好人。这是他做的所有的事。”弗里茨叔叔说，他正好听见了后面几句话，猜出来孩子们脑子里在想什么了。</p>
<p>“我来告诉你们约翰·布鲁克的故事，你们会发现为什么人们尊敬他，为什么他宁愿做个好人，而不是富人、名人。他只是在所有事情上尽职尽责，每件事都开心地做、忠诚地做，尽管他很贫穷、孤独，需要辛勤地劳动，可他一直都很耐心、勇敢和幸福。</p>
<p>9．“他是个好儿子，在他的母亲需要他的时候，他放弃了自己的计划和母亲住在一起。他是个好朋友，除了教劳里叔叔希腊语和拉丁语，还不知不觉地教会他很多东西，或是通过自己为榜样以身作则，告诉他怎样做一个正直的人。</p>
<p>10．“他还是个忠诚的仆人，对雇佣他的人来说他是如此有价值，很难有人能代替他。他也是一个好丈夫、好父亲，他那么温和、聪明、周到，劳里和我都从他身上学了好多东西，直到我们发现他默默地为家人所做的一切之后，我们知道了他是多么地爱他的家人。”</p>
<p>11．弗里茨叔叔停了一会儿，男孩们像一尊尊雕塑坐在月光下，一动不动，他继续说道，声音低沉而认真：“他快要死的时候，我对他说：‘不要担心你的妻子和孩子们，我会照顾他们，让他们什么都不少。’他微笑着握住我的手，用他一贯热情的方式说：‘不用了，我已经替他们安排好了。’”</p>
<p>12．“他确实已经安排好了，因为看到他的遗嘱时，我们发现一切井然有序——没有一分债务，他的积蓄足够让妻子过上舒适而独立的生活。我们这才知道他为什么过得如此节俭，自己拒绝了那么多的享乐，只是做些慈善。他工作得那么努力，我都担心这缩短了他的生命。</p>
<p>13．“他从来不为自己寻求帮助，但经常为别人着想，他承担自己的负担，勇敢、安静地完成自己的工作。没有人对他有一句怨言，现在他走了，所有人都发现他那么值得爱戴、称赞和敬重。我很骄傲曾经是他的朋友。我希望留给我的孩子的，和他留给他孩子的一样，而不是很多金钱。</p>
<p>14．“没错！简单、真诚的善良就是这一生最好的资本。当名誉和金钱消失的时候，它还在，这是我们能够从这个世界带走的唯一财富。孩子们，记住这一点，如果你想要获得尊重、信心和爱，跟随约翰·布鲁克的脚步吧！”</p>

<p>印奇开普暗礁</p>
<p>Robert Southey was a celebrated English poet, born 1774, who once
held the honorable position of poet laureate. He wrote a great deal both
in prose and verse. He died in 1843.</p>
<p>1．No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,</p>
<p>The ship was as still as she could be,</p>
<p>Her sails from heaven received no motion,</p>
<p>Her keel (1) was steady in the ocean.</p>
<p>2．Without either sign or sound of their shock</p>
<p>The waves flowed over the Inchcape Rock;</p>
<p>So little they rose, so little they fell,</p>
<p>They did not move the Inchcape Bell.</p>
<p>3．The good old Abbot of Aberbrothok</p>
<p>Had placed that bell on the lnchcape Rock;</p>
<p>On a buoy (2) in the storm it floated and swung,</p>
<p>And over the waves its war ning rung.</p>
<p>4．When the Rock was hid by the surges’ (3) swell,</p>
<p>The mariners heard the warning bell;</p>
<p>And then they knew the perilous Rock,</p>
<p>And blest the Abbot of Aberbrothok.</p>
<p>5．The sun in heaven was shining gay,</p>
<p>All things were joyful on that day;</p>
<p>The sea birds screamed as they wheeled round,</p>
<p>And there was joyance (4) in their sound.</p>
<p>6．The buoy of the Inchcape Bell was seen</p>
<p>A darker speck on the ocean green;</p>
<p>Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,</p>
<p>And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.</p>
<p>7．He felt the cheering power of spring,</p>
<p>It made him whistle, it made him sing;</p>
<p>His heart was mirthful to excess,</p>
<p>But the Rover’s mirth was wickedness.</p>
<p>8．His eye was on the Inchcape float;</p>
<p>Quoth he, “My men put out the boat,</p>
<p>And row me to the Inchcape Rock,</p>
<p>And I’ll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok.”</p>
<p>9．The boat is lowered, the boatmen row,</p>
<p>And to the Inchcape Rock they go;</p>
<p>Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,</p>
<p>And he cut the bell from the Inchcape float.</p>
<p>10．Down sunk the bell, with a gurgling sound,</p>
<p>The bubbles rose and burst around;</p>
<p>Quoth Sir Ralph, “The next who comes to the Rock,</p>
<p>Won’t bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok.”</p>
<p>11．Sir Ralph the Rover sailed away,</p>

<p>And now grown rich with plundered store (6) ,</p>

<p>12．So thick a haze o’erspreads the sky</p>
<p>They can not see the sun on high;</p>
<p>The wind hath blown a gale all day,</p>
<p>At evening it hath died away.</p>
<p>13．On the deck the Rover takes his stand,</p>
<p>So dark it is they see no land.</p>
<p>Quoth Sir Ralph, “It will be lighter soon,</p>
<p>For there is the dawn of the rising moon.”</p>
<p>14．“Canst hear,” said one, “the breakers roar?</p>
<p>For methinks (7) we should be near the shore.”</p>
<p>“Now where we are I can not tell,</p>
<p>But I wish I could hear the Inchcape Bell.”</p>
<p>15．They hear no sound, the swell is strong;</p>
<p>Though the wind hath fallen, they drift along,</p>
<p>Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock:</p>
<p>Cried they, “It is the Inchcape Rock!”</p>
<p>16．Sir Ralph the rover tore his hair,</p>
<p>He curst himself in his despair;</p>
<p>The waves rush in on every side,</p>
<p>The ship is sinking beneath the tide.</p>
<p>17．But even in his dying fear</p>
<p>One dreadful sound could the Rover hear,</p>
<p>A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell</p>
<p>The fiends (8) below were ringing his knell (9) .</p>

<h2 id="lesson-89-my-mothers-grave">LESSON 89 MY MOTHER’S GRAVE</h2>
<p>母亲的坟墓</p>
<p>1．It was thirteen years since my mother’s death, when, after a long
absence from my native village, I stood beside the sacred mound beneath
which I had seen her buried. Since that mournful (1) period, a great
change had come over me. My childish years had passed away, and with
them my youthful character. The world was altered, too; and as I stood
at my mother’s grave, I could hardly realize (2) that I was the same
thoughtless, happy creature, whose checks she so often kissed in an
excess (3) of tenderness.</p>
<p>2．But the varied (4) events of thirteen years had not effaced (5)
the remembrance of that mother’s smile. It seemed as if I had seen her
but yesterday—as if the blessed sound of her well-remembered voice was
in my ear. The gay dreams of my infancy and childhood were brought back
so distinctly to my mind that, had it not been for one bitter
recollection, the tears I shed would have been gentle and
refreshing.</p>
<p>3．The circumstance may seem a trifling one, but the thought of it
now pains my heart; and I relate it, that those children who have
parents to love them may learn to value them as they ought. My mother
had been ill a long time, and I had become so accustomed to her pale
face and weak voice, that I was not frightened at them, as children
usually are. At first, it is true, I sobbed violently; but when, day
after day, I returned from school, and found her the same, I began to
believe she would always be spared to me; but they told me she would
die.</p>
<p>4．One day when I had lost my place in the class, I came home
discouraged and fretful. I went to my mother’s chamber. She was paler
than usual, but she met me with the same affectionate smile that always
welcomed my return. Alas! when I look back through the lapse of thirteen
years, I think my heart must have been stone not to have been melted by
it. She requested me to go downstairs and bring her a glass of water. I
pettishly (6) asked her why she did not call a domestic to do it. With a
look of mild reproach, which I shall never forget if I live to be a
hundred years old, she said, “Will not my daughter bring a glass of
water for her poor, sick mother?”</p>
<p>5．I went and brought her the water, but I did not do it kindly.
Instead of smiling, and kissing her as I had been wont to do, I set the
glass down very quickly, and left the room. After playing a short time,
I went to bed without bidding my mother good night; but when alone in my
room, in darkness and silence, I remembered how pale she looked, and how
her voice trembled when she said, “Will not my daughter bring a glass of
water for her poor, sick mother?” I could not sleep. I stole into her
chamber to ask forgiveness. She had sunk into an easy slumber, and they
told me I must not waken her.</p>
<p>6．I did not tell anyone what troubled me, but stole back to my bed,
resolved (7) to rise early in the morning and tell her how sorry I was
for my conduct. The sun was shining brightly when I awoke, and, hurrying
on my clothes, I hastened to my mother’s chamber. She was dead! She
never spoke more—never smiled upon me again; and when I touched the hand
that used to rest upon my head in blessing, it was so cold that it made
me start.</p>
<p>7．I bowed down by her side, and sobbed in the bitterness of my
heart. I then wished that I might die, and be buried with her; and, old
as I now am, I would give worlds, were they mine to give, could my
mother but have lived to tell me she forgave my childish ingratitude (8)
. But I can not call her back; and when I stand by her grave, and
whenever I think of her manifold (9) kindness, the memory of that
reproachful look she gave me will bite like a serpent and sting like an
adder.</p>

<p>1．我母亲去世已经十三年了，离开家乡多年以后，我又站在了母亲的坟墓旁边，我曾经亲眼看见母亲被埋葬在这里。那段极度悲伤的岁月之后，我发生了很大的变化。我的孩提岁月已成往事，青春也一去不复返，世界也发生了变化。当我站在母亲的坟墓旁边，难以想象我曾是那个天真无邪的快乐家伙，脸颊曾无数次被母亲温柔地亲吻着。</p>
<p>2．但是，十三年的世事无常丝毫不能改变记忆中母亲的笑容。她的音容笑貌仿佛就在昨天，我耳边仿佛还听到熟悉的亲切声音。儿时的欢乐梦境清晰浮现在眼前，如果不是苦涩的回忆，我流的泪一定是温柔清新的。</p>
<p>3．这可能是件小事，但一想起来我的心就会疼。把我的故事讲一遍，希望那些享受着父爱母爱的孩子们能够珍惜这一切。我的母亲生病很长时间，我也习惯了她苍白的脸色和虚弱的声音，一点也不害怕了，孩子们就是这样。开始，我真的常常哭泣不止，后来，日复一日，我从学校回来，发现她和往常一样，我开始相信她会一直陪伴我，可是他们告诉我她快死了。</p>
<p>4．一天，我在学校考试成绩不理想，垂头丧气地回到家里。我来到母亲的房间，她比以前脸色更苍白了，但她一如往常地带着亲切的笑容欢迎我回来。唉，十三年后回忆起来，我觉得当时我的心一定是石头做的才没被融化。她让我下楼给她拿一杯水。我任性地问她为什么不让佣人去。她略带责备地说，这一刻即使我活到一百岁也不会忘记，“我的女儿不愿意为她生病的可怜母亲拿一杯水吗？”</p>
<p>5．我心不甘情不愿地下楼给母亲拿了一杯水。我没有对她笑，也没有像往常一样亲吻她，我很快把杯子放下，离开了她的房间。玩儿了一会儿后，我没对母亲说晚安，直接上床睡觉了，可是当我独自一人在黑暗寂静的房间里时，我想起她当时是多么苍白，声音是多么颤抖地说“我的女儿不愿意为她生病的可怜母亲拿一杯水吗”，我无法入睡。我偷偷走进她的房间想要请求她原谅我。她已经睡着了，人们告诉我不能叫醒她。</p>
<p>6．我没有告诉别人困扰我的是什么，悄悄回到我的床上，决定第二天早上早早起来告诉她我很后悔。我醒来的时候，太阳很刺眼，我快速穿上衣服，跑去母亲的房间。她已经去世了！她再也不会对我说什么，再也不会对我微笑。我触摸她的手，她曾经把手放在我头上祝福我，现在已经冰凉了，这让我大吃一惊。</p>
<p>7．我跪在她床边，内心痛苦地哭泣着。我多么希望我也死了，和她埋在一起。现在我已经不再年轻了，如果能让母亲活着告诉我她已原谅了我儿时不懂得感恩，我愿意用全世界我拥有的一切来交换。但是，我无法把她唤回，如今站在她的坟墓前，一想到她的慈祥和善，记忆中她责备我的神情就像毒蛇一样啮咬着我。</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is told of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, that, as he
was seated one day in his private room, a written petition [1] was
brought to him with the request that it should be immediately read. The
King had just returned from hunting, and the glare of the sun, or some
other cause, had so dazzled his eyes that he found it difficult to make
out a single word of the writing.</p></li>
<li><p>His private secretary happened to be absent; and the soldier who
brought the petition could not read. There was a page, or favorite boy
servant, waiting in the hall, and upon him the King called. The page was
a son of one of the noblemen of the court, but proved to be a very poor
reader.</p></li>
<li><p>In the first place, he did not articulate [2] distinctly. He
huddled his words together in the utterance, as if they were syllables
of one long word, which he must get through with as speedily as
possible. His pronunciation was bad, and he did not modulate [3] his
voice so as to bring out the meaning of what he read. Every sentence was
uttered with a dismal monotony [4] of voice, as if it did not differ in
any respect from that which preceded it.</p></li>
<li><p>“Stop!” said the King, impatiently. “Is it an auctioneer’s list
of goods to be sold that you are hurrying over? Send your companion to
me.” Another page who stood at the door now entered, and to him the King
gave the petition. The second page began by hemming and clearing his
throat in such an affected [5] manner that the King jokingly asked him
whether he had not slept in the public garden, with the gate open, the
night before.</p></li>
<li><p>The second page had a good share of self-conceit, however, and so
was not greatly confused by the King’s jest. He determined that he would
avoid the mistake which his comrade had made. So he commenced reading
the petition slowly and with great formality, emphasizing every word,
and prolonging the articulation of every syllable. But his manner was so
tedious that the King cried out, “Stop! are you reciting a lesson in the
elementary sounds? Out of the room! But no: stay! Send me that little
girl who is sitting there by the fountain.”</p></li>
<li><p>The girl thus pointed out by the King was a daughter of one of
the laborers employed by the royal gardener; and she had come to help
her father weed the flower beds. It chanced that, like many of the poor
people in Prussia, she had received a good education. She was somewhat
alarmed when she found herself in the King’s presence, but took courage
when the King told her that he only wanted her to read for him, as his
eyes were weak.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, Ernestine (for this was the name of the little girl) was
fond of reading aloud, and often many of the neighbors would assemble at
her father’s house to hear her; those who could not read themselves
would come to her, also, with their letters from distant friends or
children, and she thus formed the habit of reading various sorts of
handwriting promptly and well.</p></li>
<li><p>The King gave her the petition, and she rapidly glanced through
the opening lines to get some idea of what it was about. As she read,
her eyes began to glisten, and her breast to heave. “What is the
matter?”asked the King; “don’t you know how to read?” “Oh, yes!
sire,”she replied, addressing him with the title usually applied to him:
“I will now read it, if you please.”</p></li>
<li><p>The two pages were about to leave the room. “Remain,” said the
King. The little girl began to read the petition. It was from a poor
widow, whose only son had been drafted [6] to serve in the army,
although his health was delicate and his pursuits had been such as to
unfit him for military life. His father had been killed in battle, and
the son had a strong desire to become a portrait painter.</p></li>
<li><p>The writer told her story in a simple, concise [7] manner, that
carried to the heart a belief of its truth; and Ernestine read it with
so much feeling, and with an articulation so just, in tones so pure and
distinct, that when she had finished, the King, into whose eyes the
tears had started, exclaimed, “Oh! now I understand what it is all
about; but I might never have known, certainly I never should have felt,
its meaning had I trusted to these young gentlemen, whom I now dismiss
from my service for one year, advising them to occupy their time in
learning to read.”</p></li>
<li><p>“As for you, my young lady,” continued the King, “I know you will
ask no better reward for your trouble than the pleasure of carrying to
this poor widow my order for her son’s immediate discharge [8] . Let me
see whether you can write as well as you can read. Take this pen, and
write as I dictate [9] .” He then dictated an order, which Ernestine
wrote, and he signed. Calling one of his guards, he bade him go with the
girl and see that the order was obeyed.</p></li>
<li><p>How much happiness was Ernestine the means of bestowing through
her good elocution, united to the happy circumstance that brought it to
the knowledge of the King! First, there were her poor neighbors, to whom
she could give instruction and entertainment. Then, there was the poor
widow who sent the petition, and who not only regained her son, but
received through Ernestine an order for him to paint the King’s
likeness; so that the poor boy soon rose to great distinction [10] , and
had more orders than he could attend to. Words could not express [11]
his gratitude, and that of his mother, to the little girl.</p></li>
<li><p>And Ernestine had, moreover, the satisfaction of aiding her
father to rise in the world, so that he became the King’s chief
gardener. The King did not forget her, but had her well educated at his
own expense. As for the two pages, she was indirectly the means of doing
them good, also; for, ashamed of their bad reading, they commenced
studying in earnest, till they overcame the faults that had offended the
King. Both finally rose to distinction, one as a lawyer, and the other
as a statesman; and they owed their advancement in life chiefly to their
good elocution.</p></li>

<p>NOTES.—Fredorick II. of Prussia (b. 1712, d. 1788), or Frederick the
Great, as he was called, was one of the greatest of German rulers. He
was distinguished for his military exploits, for his wise and just
government, and for his literary attainments. He wrote many able works
in the French language. Many pleasant anecdotes are told of this king,
of which the one given in the lesson is a fair sample.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>有一天，普鲁士国王腓特烈大帝坐在他的私人房间里，士兵呈上一份请愿信，呈请国王立即审阅。当时，国王刚刚从狩猎场返回，刺眼的阳光，或是其他一些原因，影响了他的视力，他发现自己看不清信上的任何一个字。</p></li>
<li><p>他的私人秘书正巧不在场，而为他送来这份请愿信的士兵也不识字。当时，有一个男侍，或者不如说一位乖巧侍童，正等候在大厅里，于是腓特烈大帝召唤了他。这个男侍是一位宫廷贵族的儿子，但国王很快发现，他是个糟糕的朗读者。</p></li>
<li><p>首先，他的发音不够清晰。他吐字很含糊，听起来，有些词语音节应该很长，可他总是急不可耐地含糊读完。他的发音也很糟糕，并没有根据这封请愿信的意思而调整他的语调。他所表述的每个句子都是令人沮丧的单调声音，毫无抑扬顿挫之感或音调变化，似乎句子之间不存在任何差别。</p></li>
<li><p>“够了！”国王不耐烦地打断了他，“这难道是一份你急着卖掉的拍卖货物清单？叫你的同伴过来见我。”于是，正站在门口等候的另一名男侍进来了，国王将请愿书交给他。这个男侍做作地清了清嗓子，然后才开始朗读。国王诙谐地问他，昨晚是不是虽然没在公园里过夜，但睡觉时门却整晚没关。</p></li>
<li><p>这个男侍相当自负，对国王的俏皮话，似乎不太在意。他决定避免犯下他的同伴所犯的错误，于是，他开始慢慢地、庄重地读这封请愿书，强调每一个字，拉长每一个发音，但他读得如此乏味造作，国王不禁大声呵斥：“够了！你难道是在按基本发音背诵课文吗？给我滚出去！不，等等，留下来！把那个坐在喷泉旁的小女孩给我叫来。”</p></li>
<li><p>国王说的这名女孩，是宫廷花师所雇佣人的女儿，那天，她是来帮助父亲给宫廷花圃除草的。碰巧的是，像许多普鲁士的穷人一样，她接受过良好的教育。当发现自己正站在国王面前时，她多少有点惊慌，但国王告诉她，由于他眼睛看不清，只希望她能为自己读一封请愿信，她才稍稍鼓起了勇气。</p></li>
<li><p>欧丝婷（小女孩名字）喜欢大声朗读，她的许多邻居经常聚集在她家中来听她读书；那些不识字的人，会带着他们远方朋友或孩子的来信来找她帮忙。她因此养成了朗读各种各样手写信件的习惯，读得既快速又好听。</p></li>
<li><p>国王将请愿书交给她，她迅速浏览了开篇几行字，很快理解了信里的意思。当她看这封信的时候，她眼中泪光闪烁，呼吸急速。“怎么了？”国王问，“难道你不知道该怎么读？”“哦，我知道！陛下，”她回答道，用尊敬的语气对他说，“如果您愿意的话，我现在就开始为您读这封信。”</p></li>
<li><p>那两名男侍想退出房间。“留下。”国王下令。小女孩开始读这封请愿信。这封信是一位穷苦的寡妇写的，她唯一的儿子被征募去军队服役，尽管他身虚体弱，志向亦不在行伍。他的父亲已经在战场上牺牲了，而这个少年还有个梦寐以求的愿望，想成为一名肖像画家。</p></li>
<li><p>这个寡妇在信里用质朴简洁的语言讲述了她的遭遇，文字中流露出的真切情感令人动容。欧丝婷满怀深情地读着它，她的发音如此清晰，语调如此纯正，抑扬顿挫，以至于当她读完的时候，国王也忍不住流泪了，他惊呼道：“天哪！现在我才明白这封信里说的是什么。但是，如果听信那些年轻贵族的话，我将永远无从了解，准确地说，永远不会像现在这样感受到这封信的深刻含义。现在，我要将那些家伙辞退一年，让他们好好学学如何朗读。”</p></li>
<li><p>“至于你，我的孩子，”国王继续说，“我要派你去向这位穷苦的寡妇传达我的旨意：她的儿子不用服兵役了。我想，为她传达这样一个令人高兴的消息，大概是对你为我读信的最好奖赏。来吧，让我看看你是否能准确书写，像你的阅读那么棒。拿着这支笔，写下我的口谕。”接着，他口述了一份命令，欧丝婷将它写下来，国王随后签上了自己的名字。他叫来一个卫兵，吩咐他跟着这个女孩去传达国王的旨意。</p></li>
<li><p>通过感情真挚的阅读，让国王获悉了民情，欧丝婷简直快乐极了！首先，那些贫困的邻居们从她那儿得到了指导与安慰。其次，呈送请愿信的可怜寡妇不仅重新与儿子一起生活，而且还从欧丝婷那里得到国王的旨意，安排她的儿子为国王画像。这个穷苦孩子很快就出人头地，得到很多让他画像的订单，忙都忙不过来了，千言万语都无法表达出这位少年和他的寡母对小姑娘欧丝婷的深深感激之情。</p></li>
<li><p>不仅如此，欧丝婷的父亲后来被提拔为国王的首席园丁，在世界园林界赢得了声誉，这一点，让欧丝婷非常自豪。国王没有忘记她，花钱让她接受了良好的教育。至于那两名男侍，他们也间接从她身上受益。由于为自己糟糕的朗读能力而感到羞愧，他们开始认真学习，直到克服了原先触怒国王的那些阅读障碍。他们最终也出人头地了，一位做了律师，另一位成了政治家，他们将所获得的成就归功于良好的演说能力。</p></li>

<p>THE GENTLE HAND</p>
<p>温柔的手</p>
<p>Timothy S. Arthur (b. 1809, d. 1885) was born near Newburgh, N.Y.,
but passed most of his life at Baltimore and Philadelphia. His
opportunities for good schooling were quite limited, and he may be
considered a self-educated man. He was the author of more than a hundred
volumes, principally novels of a domestic and moral tone, and of many
shorter tales—magazine articles, etc. “Ten Nights in a Barroom,” and
“Three Years in a Mantrap,” are among his best known works.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>When and where it matters not now to relate—but once upon a time,
as I was passing through a thinly peopled district of country, night
came down upon me almost unawares. Being on foot, I could not hope to
gain the village toward which my steps were directed, until a late hour;
and I therefore preferred seeking shelter and a night’s lodging at the
first humble dwelling that presented itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Dusky twilight was giving place to deeper shadows, when I found
myself in the vicinity [1] of a dwelling, from the small uncurtained
windows of which the light shone with a pleasant promise of good cheer
and comfort. The house stood within an inclosure, and a short distance
from the road along which I was moving with wearied feet.</p></li>
<li><p>Turning aside, and passing through the ill-hung gate, I
approached the dwelling. Slowly the gate swung on its wooden hinges, and
the rattle of its latch, in closing, did not disturb the air until I had
nearly reached the porch in front of the house, in which a slender girl,
who had noticed my entrance, stood awaiting my arrival.</p></li>
<li><p>A deep, quick bark answered, almost like an echo, the sound of
the shutting gate, and, sudden as an apparition, the form of an immense
dog loomed in the doorway. At the instant when he was about to spring, a
light hand was laid upon his shaggy neck, and a low word
spoken.</p></li>
<li><p>“Go in, Tiger,”said the girl, not in a voice of authority, yet in
her gentle tones was the consciousness that she would be obeyed; and, as
she spoke, she lightly bore upon the animal with her hand, and he turned
away and disappeared within the dwelling.</p></li>
<li><p>“Who’s that?”A rough voice asked the question; and now a
heavy-looking man took the dog’s place in the door.</p></li>
<li><p>“How far is it to G—?”I asked, not deeming it best to say, in the
beginning, that I sought a resting place for the night.</p></li>
<li><p>“To G—!”growled the man, but not so harshly as at first. “It’s
good six miles from here.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A long distance; and I’m a stranger and on foot,” said I. “If
you can make room for me until morning, I will be very
thankful.”</p></li>
<li><p>I saw the girl’s hand move quickly up his arm, until it rested on
his shoulder, and now she leaned to him still closer.</p></li>
<li><p>“Come in. We’ll try what can be done for you.” There was a change
in the man’s voice that made me wonder. I entered a large room, in which
blazed a brisk fire. Before the fire sat two stout lads, who turned upon
me their heavy eyes, with no very welcome greeting. A middle-aged woman
was standing at a table, and two children were amusing themselves with a
kitten on the floor.</p></li>
<li><p>“A stranger, mother,” said the man who had given me so rude a
greeting at the door; “and he wants us to let him stay all
night.”</p></li>
<li><p>The woman looked at me doubtingly for a few moments, and then
replied coldly, “We don’t keep a public house.”</p></li>
<li><p>“I’m aware of that, ma’am,” said I; “but night has overtaken me,
and it’s a long way yet to G——.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Too far for a tired man to go on foot,” said the master of the
house, kindly, “so it’s no use talking about it, mother; we must give
him a bed.”</p></li>
<li><p>So unobtrusively [2] that I scarce noticed the movement, the girl
had drawn to her mother’s side. What she said to her I did not hear, for
the brief words were uttered in a low voice; but I noticed, as she
spoke, one small, fair hand rested on the woman’s hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Was there magic in that touch? The woman’s repulsive [3] aspect
changed into one of kindly welcome, and she said, “Yes, it’s a long way
to G——. I guess we can find a place for him.”</p></li>
<li><p>Many times more during that evening, did I observe the magic
power of that hand and voice—the one gentle yet potent [4] as the other.
On the next morning, breakfast being over, I was preparing to take my
departure when my host [5] informed me that if I would wait for half an
hour he would give me a ride in his wagon to G——, as business required
him to go there. I was very well pleased to accept of the
invitation.</p></li>
<li><p>In due time, the farmer’s wagon was driven into the road before
the house, and I was invited to get in. I noticed the horse as a
rough-looking Canadian pony, with a certain air of stubborn endurance.
As the farmer took his seat by my side, the family came to the door to
see us off.</p></li>
<li><p>“Dick!” said the farmer in a peremptory [6] voice, giving the
rein a quick jerk as he spoke. But Dick moved not a step. “Dick! you
vagabond! get up.” And the farmer’s whip cracked sharply by the pony’s
ear.</p></li>
<li><p>It availed [7] not, however, this second appeal. Dick stood
firmly disobedient. Next the whip was brought down upon him with an
impatient hand; but the pony only reared up a little. Fast and sharp the
strokes were next dealt to the number of half a dozen. The man might as
well have beaten the wagon, for all his end was gained.</p></li>
<li><p>A stout lad now came out into the road, and, catching Dick by the
bridle, jerked him forward, using, at the same time, the customary
language on such occasions, but Dick met this new ally [8] with
increased stubbornness, planting his fore feet more firmly and at a
sharper angle with the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>The impatient boy now struck the pony on the side of the head
with his clinched hand, and jerked cruelly at his bridle. It availed
nothing, however; Dick was not to be wrought upon by any such
arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>“Don’t do so, John!” I turned my head as the maiden’s sweet voice
reached my ear. She was passing through the gate into the road, and in
the next moment had taken hold of the lad and drawn him away from the
animal. No strength was exerted in this; she took hold of his arm, and
he obeyed her wish as readily as if he had no thought beyond her
gratification.</p></li>
<li><p>And now that soft hand was laid gently on the pony’s neck, and a
single low word spoken. How instantly were the tense [9] muscles relaxed
[10] —how quickly the stubborn air vanished!</p></li>
<li><p>“Poor Dick!” said the maiden, as she stroked his neck lightly, or
softly patted it with a childlike hand. “Now, go along, you provoking
fellow!” she added, in a half-chiding [11] , yet affectionate voice, as
she drew up the bridle.</p></li>
<li><p>The pony turned toward her, and rubbed his head against her arm
for an instant or two; then, pricking up his ears, he started off at a
light, cheerful trot, and went on his way as freely as if no silly
crotchet [12] had ever entered his stubborn brain.</p></li>
<li><p>“What a wonderful power that hand possesses!” said I, speaking to
my companion, as we rode away.</p></li>
<li><p>He looked at me for a moment, as if my remark had occasioned
surprise. Then a light came into his countenance, and he said briefly,
“She’s good! Everybody and everything loves her.”</p></li>
<li><p>Was that, indeed, the secret of her power? Was the quality of her
soul perceived in the impression of her hand, even by brute beasts! The
father’s explanation was doubtless the true one. Yet have I ever since
wondered, and still do wonder, at the potency which lay in that maiden’s
magic touch. I have seen something of the same power, showing itself in
the loving and the good, but never to the extent as instanced [13] in
her, whom, for want of a better name, I must still call “Gentle
Hand.”</p></li>

<p>蒂莫西·S·亚瑟（1809—1885）出生于美国纽约州纽堡市附近，但他在巴尔的摩和费城度过生命中的大部分时光。他所受的正规教育很有限，属于自学成才的类型。他的著述多达一百多部，其中主要是家庭和道德伦理方面的小说，以及为期刊杂志撰写的大量篇幅更短的文章。在他的作品中，《酒吧里的十个夜晚》和《无间道·三年》都流传甚广。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>这件事发生在何时、何地，现在看来并不重要——姑且叫它从前吧，当我正穿过一处人烟稀少的地方时，夜幕悄然降临了。由于是步行，如果我想到达原先想去的城镇，恐怕得走到深夜。于是我急切地想找个地方过夜，随便哪个先碰上的房舍都行，不管条件有多简陋，对付一晚足矣。</p></li>
<li><p>暗淡的暮色渐渐褪去，黑暗降临了。这时我发现附近有户人家，从几扇不挂窗帘的小窗户中透出的光，似乎正传递着温暖而愉悦的气氛。这栋屋子四周围着栅栏，离我所行走的路很近，而我正疲累不堪。</p></li>
<li><p>我离开小路，推开虚掩的栅栏门，走近这栋屋子。栅栏门上的木质铰链在慢慢晃动着，门关上时，门闩发出轻微的声响。这些声音都没有惊动屋内欢乐的气氛，一直等我快走到门廊了，才发现有位身材苗条的姑娘站在那里，显然，刚才她听到了我的脚步声。</p></li>
<li><p>门刚关上，像是回应这个声响似的，响起一声低沉而短促的狗吠；紧接着，一条体型硕大的狗幽灵般地出现在门廊上。眼看它快扑上来的时候，一只手轻轻搭在它毛发蓬松的脖颈上，一个温柔的声音低声响起。</p></li>
<li><p>“小虎，进去。”姑娘说道，声音并不威严，但她温柔的嗓音中带着一种不容置疑的清晰暗示。一边说着，她一边轻拍了几下大狗的脑袋，于是那狗转过身，进了屋。</p></li>
<li><p>“谁在那儿？”一个粗犷的声音传来，一个脸色阴沉的男人从狗的身后闪出。</p></li>
<li><p>“请问，这儿离G地还有多远？”我问道。一开始就告诉他我想找个今晚过夜的地方，大概不是个好主意，我想。</p></li>
<li><p>“G地！”男人大声地说着，言语间却少了最初的严厉，“离这儿还有足足六英里呢。”</p></li>
<li><p>“路可真够远的。我是步行来的，一个过路客，”我说，“如果你们能让我在这里歇上一晚，我真是感激不尽。”</p></li>
<li><p>我看到那姑娘的手沿着那男人的手臂上移，最后搭在他肩上，现在她离那男人更近了些。</p></li>
<li><p>“进来吧，看看我们能给你帮上什么忙。”男人的语气有所变化，让我颇觉意外。我进了屋，房间很宽敞，壁炉中的火苗轻快地跃动着。壁炉前，坐着两个身材结实的小伙子，他们满脸阴沉地抬眼看我，明显带着不快的神情。一位中年妇女站在桌子旁边，两个孩子在地板上自顾自地逗着小猫咪。</p></li>
<li><p>“孩子他妈，这个过路的，”刚才在门前粗鲁地与我打招呼的那个男人说道，“想在我们这儿过一夜。”</p></li>
<li><p>那妇人狐疑地打量我片刻，冷冷地说：“我们这儿没有客房。”</p></li>
<li><p>“我知道，夫人，”我说，“但是，天太晚了，去G地实在太远了。”</p></li>
<li><p>“让一个疲惫的人走这么长一段路，太荒唐了。”男主人和蔼地说，“不用再讨论了，孩子他妈，我们得为他匀出一张床。”</p></li>
<li><p>悄无声息地，那姑娘已经靠近她母亲，我几乎没注意到她是何时走过去的。她悄声对她母亲说了些什么，声音太轻，我听不见内容。但我注意到，当她说话时，她那娇小美丽的手已轻轻搭在她母亲的手上。</p></li>
<li><p>她的触摸有魔法吗？那妇人反感冷淡的态度瞬间变得亲切和善，她说：“说得对，到G地还远着呢。我想，我们是得帮他准备张床。”</p></li>
<li><p>就在那个晚上，我无数次地观察到那双手和那个声音——像她的手一般温柔而有力所具有的魔力。第二天早上，吃完早餐后，我正打算告辞，男主人告诉我，他要赶往G地办事，如果我愿意多等待半小时，他便可以用自己的马车送我一程，我自然非常高兴地接受了他的好意。</p></li>
<li><p>约定的时间到了，那农夫将马车停在屋前的马路上，招呼我上车。我注意到那匹驾辕的马，那马驹面部粗糙，属于加拿大品种，具有顽强忍耐的优良品性。农夫上了马车，坐在我身边，全家人走出门来为我们送行。</p></li>
<li><p>“狄克！”农民严厉地呵斥，一边猛地拉动缰绳，但狄克竟然一步都没挪动，“狄克，你这个懒鬼！快走啊。”农夫猛地一甩鞭，鞭子声在小马的耳边尖锐地乍响。</p></li>
<li><p>依然毫不奏效，狄克固执地站在那里，无动于衷。男主人急躁起来，第二鞭便甩到小马驹身上，但它只是暴跳了一下。接着几鞭又快又狠地甩在马驹背上，但全无效果，农夫如果早知道他最终束手无策，还不如起先就鞭打那马车罢。</p></li>
<li><p>一个身材粗壮的小伙子走到路中间，抓着狄克的缰绳猛地向前拽，边拽边骂骂咧咧。但狄克面对这个新来的敌人，报以更加倔强的姿态，将前蹄死死抵住地面，怎么都不肯动弹。</p></li>
<li><p>小伙子不耐烦起来，开始握紧拳头狠揍小马驹的脑袋，然后死命地猛拽缰绳。但这同样毫不奏效，狄克无论如何就是不肯迈开蹄子。</p></li>
<li><p>“别这么做，约翰！”少女甜美的声音传来。我循声扭头，她正穿过栅栏门，走到路上，接着她握住小伙子的手臂，将他轻轻从小马驹身边推开。在做这些事情的时候，她的动作很温柔。她抓住他的手臂，而他也毫不反抗地任她这么做，丝毫没有忤逆她的意思。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，她柔软的手正温柔抚摸着小马驹的脖颈，嘴里对它低低地说着些什么。一转眼间，小马驹身上那紧绷的肌肉便放松了——原本僵持的气氛一扫而空！</p></li>
<li><p>“可怜的狄克！”少女一边说着，一边抚摸着它的脖子，或者说，是用她娇小的手温柔地拍打了它几下，“现在，去吧，你这爱折腾人的孩子！”她提了提笼头，语气中略带责备，但仍然满怀爱意。</p></li>
<li><p>小马驹转向她，将脑袋靠在她臂弯间蹭了几下，接着，它竖起耳朵，开始轻快地跑起碎步来。它的步伐越来越矫健，就好像刚才不曾有任何怪异的念头盘踞在它那固执的小脑瓜里一样。</p></li>
<li><p>马车跑起来了。“那双手，拥有多么奇妙的力量啊！”我对身旁的农夫说道。</p></li>
<li><p>农夫注视了我片刻，似乎我的评论使他偶发惊奇，他的脸上闪过一丝喜悦，却只说了句：“她心地仁慈，这里的人和那些牲口都喜欢她。”</p></li>
<li><p>这便是她魅力的源泉吗？大家都从她的双手中感受到她灵魂的高贵，即使是那些不通人性的动物！她父亲的解释无疑道出了真相。但从那以后，我始终很好奇，直到今天也仍然想知道，那名少女充满魔力的抚摸中到底蕴藏了多少力量。我曾见过通过爱与善表达出来的类似力量，但从来没有一种力量能像我在她身上见到的那么强大。这种力量，在没有更好的名称之前，我愿称它为“温柔的手”。</p></li>

<p>A BOY ON A FARM</p>
<p>农场少年</p>
<p>Charles Dudley Warner (b. 1829, d.1900) was born at Plainfield, Mass.
In 1851 he graduated at Hamilton College, and in 1856 was admitted to
the bar at Philadelphia, but moved to Chicago to practice his
profession. There he remained until 1860, when he became connected with
the press at Hartford, Conn., and has ever since devoted himself to
literature. “My Summer in a Garden,” “Saunterings,” and “Backlog
Studies” are his best known works. The following extract is from “Being
a Boy.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Say what you will about the general usefulness of boys, it is my
impression that a farm without a boy would very soon come to grief. What
the boy does is the life of the farm. He is the factotum [1] , always in
demand, always expected to do the thousand indispensable [2] things that
nobody else will do. Upon him fall all the odds and ends, the most
difficult things.</p></li>
<li><p>After everybody else is through, he has to finish up. His work is
like a woman’s,—perpetually [3] waiting on others. Everybody knows how
much easier it is to eat a good dinner than it is to wash the dishes
afterwards. Consider what a boy on a farm is required to do,—things that
must be done, or life would actually stop.</p></li>
<li><p>It is understood, in the first place, that he is to do all the
errands, to go to the store, to the post office, and to carry all sorts
of messages. If he had as many legs as a centiped [4] , they would tire
before night. His two short limbs seem to him entirely inadequate to the
task. He would like to have as many legs as a wheel has spokes, and
rotate about in the same way.</p></li>
<li><p>This he sometimes tries to do; and the people who have seen him
“turning cart wheels” along the side of the road, have supposed that he
was amusing himself and idling his time; he was only trying to invent a
new mode of locomotion, so that he could economize [5] his legs, and do
his errands with greater dispatch [6] .</p></li>
<li><p>He practices standing on his head, in order to accustom himself
to any position. Leapfrog is one of his methods of getting over the
ground quickly. He would willingly go an errand any distance if he could
leapfrog it with a few other boys.</p></li>
<li><p>He has a natural genius for combining pleasure with business.
This is the reason why, when he is sent to the spring for a pitcher of
water, he is absent so long; for he stops to poke the frog that sits on
the stone, or, if there is a penstock [7] , to put his hand over the
spout, and squirt the water a little while.</p></li>
<li><p>He is the one who spreads the grass when the men have cut it; he
mows it away in the barn; he rides the horse, to cultivate the corn, up
and down the hot, weary rows; he picks up the potatoes when they are
dug; he drives the cows night and morning; he brings wood and water, and
splits kindling; he gets up the horse, and puts out the horse; whether
he is in the house or out of it, there is always something for him to
do.</p></li>
<li><p>Just before the school in winter he shovels paths; in summer he
turns the grindstone. He knows where there are lots of wintergreens and
sweet flags, but instead of going for them, he is to stay indoors and
pare apples, and stone raisins, and pound something in a mortar. And
yet, with his mind full of schemes of what he would like to do, and his
hands full of occupations, he is an idle boy, who has nothing to busy
himself with but school and chores [8] !</p></li>
<li><p>He would gladly do all the work if somebody else would do the
chores, he thinks; and yet I doubt if any boy ever amounted to anything
in the world, or was of much use as a man, who did not enjoy the
advantages of a liberal education in the way of chores.</p></li>

<p>查尔斯·达德利·华纳（1829—1900）出生于美国马萨诸塞州麦斯·普兰菲尔德市。
1851年，他从汉密尔顿学院毕业，并于1856年在费城取得律师执照，他后来搬到芝加哥从事律师见习。
1860年，他离开芝加哥，与康涅狄格州哈特福德市的出版社联系密切，从此投身于文学创作。他最著名的作品有《花园中的夏天》、《闲庭漫步》和《对滞压工作的研究》，下面这篇文章节选自他的《少年当自强》。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>如果你让我谈谈一个少年能做什么，我觉得，一个没有少年的农场大概很快就会前景黯淡。一个少年所做的事情，在农场生活里须臾不可缺少。他是农场的杂事总管，每个人都需要他，指望他做许多别人不愿意做，又必不可少的事情，各种各样最困难的零杂琐事都落在他的肩上。</p></li>
<li><p>当别人都忙完了以后，农场少年得去扫尾。他的工作有点像女人们的活儿——总是要伺候别人。毋庸置疑，外出赴宴享受美味大餐永远比餐后洗刷碗碟轻松太多太多。想想一个农场少年平时要干的活儿——这些事情必须得有人做，要不然，生活可就过不下去了。</p></li>
<li><p>首先，众所周知，农场少年得负责所有跑腿的差事，譬如去商店、上邮局、给大家传递各种各样的口信。哪怕他的腿像蜈蚣那么多，晚上上床躺倒前也还是会累个半死。他还那么小，指望两条小短腿干活儿真是远远不够。他恨不得再多长几条腿，像自行车轮上的辐条那么多，恐怕也还要连轴转个不停。</p></li>
<li><p>他有时会试着这么做，有些人曾见农场少年在路边“转着轮子”，以为他不过是闲着没事干，自娱自乐。实际上，他只不过是想发明一种新的运动方式，以便节省腿力，完成更多指派或差遣。</p></li>
<li><p>他还经常练习倒立，来训练自己习惯各种姿势。蛙跳行进堪称快捷走完路程的美妙方法之一，要是能与几个狐朋狗友互动互乐更好，这样的话，他会心甘情愿四下跑腿，路再远也毫不在乎。</p></li>
<li><p>忙中作乐，是农场少年与生俱来的天赋。所以，如果有人让他去泉水边汲水，很长时间他都不会回来。他会在路边停留片刻，捅捅趴在石头上的青蛙；要是路边有个水渠，他就会把手捂在喷口上一会儿，把水弄得飞溅。</p></li>
<li><p>大人们割下田里的草，农场少年需要把草铺开晒干，他还要把谷仓里的干草堆成垛。他要骑马，种玉米，在热浪熏天的一排排玉米田里劳作；大人们把土豆挖出来，他跟着收土豆；清晨，他赶着牛群外出放牧，黄昏，他牵着牛群打道回府；他还要拣柴、打水、生火、喂马、遛马……屋里屋外，他每天总有做不完的事情。</p></li>
<li><p>冬天，去上学前，农场少年总要先铲除路上的积雪；夏天，他便找出磨刀石来把砍柴刀好好磨磨。他知道哪里的鹿蹄草最多，哪里的白菖蒲最甜。但是，他可没空出门采摘，他得待在家里削苹果，把葡萄晾在石头上晒干，或是在研钵里臼些什么东西。但是，即使他总是要不停地忙着各种杂活，他脑子里却总会想着各种各样他想做的事情。除了学校和这些无穷无尽的家务以外，他仍是个自由的男孩！</p></li>
<li><p>农场少年觉得，如果有人愿意揽下这些闲杂琐事，他会很乐意去做那些正经活计。可是，我怀疑，如果一个男孩不愿意做这些杂活，没法从这些琐事中享受到自由成长的乐趣，他以后是否能在世上找到可干的事儿，能否像个男人一样承担自己的责任。</p></li>

<p>Jean Ingelow (b. 1830, d.1897) was born at Boston, Lincolnshire,
England. Her fame as a poetess was at once established upon the
publication of her “Poems” in 1863; since which time several other
volumes have appeared. The most generally admired of her poems are
“Songs of Seven” and “The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire,” She
has also written several successful novels, of which, “Off the Skelligs”
is the most popular. “Stories Told to a Child,” “The Cumberers,” “Poor
Mat,” “Studies for Stories,” and “Mopsa, the Fairy” are also well known.
Miss Ingelow resided in London, England, and spent much of her time in
deeds of charity.</p>

<li>A nightingale made a mistake;</li>
</ol>
<p>She sang a few notes out of tune:</p>
<p>Her heart was ready to break,</p>
<p>And she hid away from the moon.</p>
<p>She wrung her claws, poor thing,</p>
<p>But was far too proud to weep;</p>
<p>She tucked her head under her wing,</p>
<p>And pretended to be asleep.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>A lark, arm in arm with a thrush,</li>
</ol>
<p>Came sauntering [1] up to the place;</p>
<p>The nightingale felt herself blush,</p>
<p>Though feathers hid her face;</p>
<p>She knew they had heard her song,</p>
<p>She felt them snicker [2] and sneer;</p>
<p>She thought that life was too long,</p>
<p>And wished she could skip a year.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“O nightingale!” cooed a dove;</li>
</ol>
<p>“O nightingale! what’s the use?</p>
<p>You bird of beauty and love,</p>
<p>Why behave like a goose?</p>
<p>Don’t sulk away from our sight,</p>
<p>Like a common, contemptible fowl;</p>
<p>You bird of joy and delight,</p>
<p>Why behave like an owl?</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>“Only think of all you have done;</li>
</ol>
<p>Only think of all you can do;</p>
<p>A false note is really fun</p>
<p>From such a bird as you!</p>
<p>Lift up your proud little crest [3] ,</p>
<p>Open your musical beak;</p>
<p>Other birds have to do their best,</p>
<p>You need only to speak!”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>The nightingale shyly took</li>
</ol>
<p>Her head from under her wing,</p>
<p>And, giving the dove a look,</p>
<p>Straightway began to sing.</p>
<p>There was never a bird could pass;</p>
<p>The night was divinely [4] calm;</p>
<p>And the people stood on the grass</p>
<p>To hear that wonderful psalm.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>The nightingale did not care,</li>
</ol>
<p>She only sang to the skies;</p>
<p>Her song ascended there,</p>
<p>And there she fixed her eyes.</p>
<p>The people that stood below</p>
<p>She knew but little about;</p>
<p>And this tale has a moral [5] , I know,</p>
<p>If you’ll try and find it out.</p>
<p>NOTE.—The nightingale is a small bird, about six inches in length,
with a coat of dark-brown feathers above and of grayish-white beneath.
Its voice is astonishingly strong and sweet, and, when wild, it usually
sings throughout the evening and night from April to the middle of
summer. The bird is common in Europe, but is not found in America.</p>

<li><p>About twenty years ago there lived a singular gentleman in the
Old Hall among the elm trees. He was about three-score years of age,
very rich, and somewhat odd in many of his habits, but for generosity
and benevolence he had no equal.</p></li>
<li><p>No poor cottager stood in need of comforts, which he was not
ready to supply; no sick man or woman languished [1] for want of his
assistance; and not even a beggar, unless a known impostor [2] , went
empty-handed from the Hall. Like the village pastor described in
Goldsmith’s poem of “The Deserted Village,”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“His house was known to all the vagrant train;</p>
<p>He chid their wand’rings, but relieved their pain;</p>
<p>The long-remembered beggar was his guest,</p>
<p>Whose beard descending swept his aged breast.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Now it happened that the old gentleman wanted a boy to wait upon
him at table, and to attend him in different ways, for he was very fond
of young people. But much as he liked the society of the young, he had a
great aversion [3] to that curiosity in which many young people are apt
to indulge [4] . He used to say, “The boy who will peep into a drawer
will be tempted to take something out of it; and he who will steal a
penny in his youth will steal a pound [5] in his manhood.”</p></li>
<li><p>No sooner was it known that the old gentleman was in want of a
boy than twenty applications [6] were made for the situation; but he
determined not to engage anyone until he had in some way ascertained
that he did not possess a curious, prying disposition.</p></li>
<li><p>On Monday morning seven lads, dressed in their Sunday clothes,
with bright and happy faces, made their appearance at the Hall, each of
them desiring to obtain the situation. Now the old gentleman, being of a
singular disposition, had prepared a room in such a way that he might
easily know if any of the young people who applied were given to meddle
unnecessarily with things around them, or to peep into cupboards and
drawers. He took care that the lads who were then at Elm Tree Hall
should be shown into this room one after another.</p></li>
<li><p>And first, Charles Brown was sent into the room, and told that he
would have to wait a little. So Charles sat down on a chair near the
door. For some time he was very quiet, and looked about him; but there
seemed to be so many curious things in the room that at last he got up
to peep at them.</p></li>
<li><p>On the table was placed a dish cover, and Charles wanted sadly to
know what was under it, but he felt afraid of lifting it up. Bad habits
are strong things; and, as Charles was of a curious disposition, he
could not withstand the temptation of taking one peep. So he lifted up
the cover.</p></li>
<li><p>This turned out to be a sad affair; for under the dish cover was
a heap of very light feathers; part of the feathers, drawn up by a
current of air, flew about the room, and Charles, in his fright, putting
the cover down hastily, puffed the rest of them off the table.</p></li>
<li><p>What was to be done? Charles began to pick up the feathers one by
one; but the old gentleman, who was in an adjoining room, hearing a
scuffle, and guessing the cause of it, entered the room, to the
consternation [7] of Charles Brown, who was very soon dismissed as a boy
who had not principle [8] enough to resist even a slight
temptation.</p></li>
<li><p>When the room was once more arranged, Henry Wilkins was placed
there until such time as he should be sent for. No sooner was he left to
himself than his attention was attracted by a plate of fine, ripe
cherries. Now Henry was uncommonly fond of cherries, and he thought it
would be impossible to miss one cherry among so many. He looked and
longed, and longed and looked, for some time, and just as he had got off
his seat to take one, he heard, as he thought, a foot coming to the
door; but no, it was a false alarm.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking fresh courage, he went cautiously and took a very fine
cherry, for he was determined to take but one, and put it into his
mouth. It was excellent; and then he persuaded himself that he ran no
risk in taking another; this he did, and hastily popped it into his
mouth.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, the old gentleman had placed a few artificial [9] cherries
at the top of the others, filled with Cayenne pepper; one of these Henry
had unfortunately taken, and it made his month smart and burn most
intolerably [10] . The old gentleman heard him coughing, and knew very
well what was the matter. The boy that would take what did not belong to
him, if no more than a cherry, was not the boy for him. Henry Wilkins
was sent about his business without delay, with his mouth almost as hot
as if he had put a burning coal into it.</p></li>
<li><p>Rufus Wilson was next introduced into the room and left to
himself; but he had not been there ten minutes before he began to move
from one place to another. He was of a bold, resolute temper, but not
overburdened with principle; for if he could have opened every cupboard,
closet, and drawer in the house, without being found out, he would have
done it directly.</p></li>
<li><p>Having looked around the room, he noticed a drawer to the table,
and made up his mind to peep therein. But no sooner did he lay hold of
the drawer knob than he set a large bell ringing, which was concealed
under the table. The old gentleman immediately answered the summons [11]
, and entered the room.</p></li>
<li><p>Rufus was so startled by the sudden ringing of the bell, that all
his impudence could not support him. He looked as though any one might
knock him down with a feather. The old gentleman asked him if he had
rung the bell because he wanted anything. Rufus was much confused, and
stammered, and tried to excuse himself, but all to no purpose, for it
did not prevent him from being ordered off the premises.</p></li>
<li><p>George Jones was then shown into the room by an old steward; and
being of a cautious disposition, he touched nothing, but only looked at
the things about him. At last he saw that a closet door was a little
open, and, thinking it would be impossible for any one to know that he
had opened it a little more, he very cautiously opened it an inch
farther, looking down at the bottom of the door, that it might not catch
against anything and make a noise.</p></li>
<li><p>Now had he looked at the top, instead of the bottom, it might
have been better for him; for to the top of the door was fastened a
plug, which filled up the hole of a small barrel of shot.He ventured to
open the door another inch, and then another, till, the plug being
pulled out of the barrel, the leaden shot began to pour out at a strange
rate. At the bottom of the closet was placed a tin pan, and the shot
falling upon this pan made such a clatter that George was frightened
half out of his senses.</p></li>
<li><p>The old gentleman soon came into the room to inquire what was the
matter, and there he found George nearly as pale as a sheet. George was
soon dismissed.</p></li>
<li><p>It now came the turn of Albert Jenkins to be put into the room.
The other boys had been sent to their homes by different ways, and no
one knew what the experience [12] of the other had been in the room of
trial.</p></li>
<li><p>On the table stood a small round box, with a screw top to it, and
Albert, thinking it contained something curious, could not be easy
without unscrewing the top; but no sooner did he do this than out
bounced an artificial snake, full a yard long, and fell upon his arm. He
started back, and uttered a scream which brought the old gentleman to
his elbow. There stood Albert, with the bottom of the box in one hand,
the top in the other, and the snake on the floor.</p></li>
<li><p>“Come, come,” said the old gentleman, “one snake is quite enough
to have in the house at a time; therefore, the sooner you are gone the
better.” With that he dismissed him, without waiting a moment for his
reply.</p></li>
<li><p>William Smith next entered the room, and being left alone soon
began to amuse himself in looking at the curiosities around him. William
was not only curious and prying, but dishonest, too, and observing that
the key was left in the drawer of a bookcase, he stepped on tiptoe in
that direction. The key had a wire fastened to it, which communicated
with an electrical machine, and William received such a shock as he was
not likely to forget. No sooner did he sufficiently recover himself to
walk, than he was told to leave the house, and let other people lock and
unlock their own drawers.</p></li>
<li><p>The other boy was Harry Gordon, and though he was left in the
room full twenty minutes, he never during that time stirred from his
chair. Harry had eyes in his head as well as the others, but he had more
integrity [13] in his heart; neither the dish cover, the cherries, the
drawer knob, the closet door, the round box, nor the key tempted him to
rise from his feet; and the consequence was that, in half an hour after,
he was engaged in the service of the old gentleman at Elm Tree Hall. He
followed his good old master to his grave, and received a large legacy
[14] for his upright conduct in his service.</p></li>

<li><p>无论是遇见穷困潦倒的佃农雇工，还是羸弱憔悴的乡邻妇孺，甚至衣衫褴褛的乞丐，他都会慷慨解囊，鼎力相助。只有那些臭名昭著的骗子，才会两手空空地离开他的庄园。正如戈德史密斯

<li><p>桌子上，倒扣着一个盘罩。查尔斯真想知道这罩子底下究竟藏着什么，却又不敢将罩子掀开。最后，坏习惯还是占了上风：查尔斯的好奇心太旺盛了，他终于没能抵挡住诱惑，决定只偷看一眼。于是，他掀开了盘罩。</p></li>
<li><p>这下糟糕了，原来罩子底下堆着一簇轻飘飘的羽毛。在上升气流的裹挟下，有些羽毛纷纷扬扬地飘开，散落了一地。查尔斯惊慌失措，赶紧把罩子重新盖好，并张嘴吹走桌上的零散羽毛。</p></li>
<li><p>现在该怎么办？查尔斯急忙一根根捡起地上的羽绒。此刻，老绅士走进房间。原来他一直在隔壁房间里，听到了这边的慌乱，猜到了事情的原委。令查尔斯·布朗震惊的是，他当场便被打发回家，因为他缺乏足够的定力，竟然无法抵御这微小的诱惑。</p></li>
<li><p>当房间再度被整理妥当后，亨利·威尔金斯被带了进来，被告知要稍等片刻。仆人一离开，他的注意力便被桌上一盘诱人的成熟樱桃吸引住了。要知道，亨利最喜欢的水果就是樱桃。他心想，盘子里这么多樱桃，哪怕少了一个，也不会有人发现。他四下张望着，渴望着，渴望着，又四下张望着。这样过了一会儿，就在他打算离开座位去拿一颗樱桃的时候，他似乎听到门边有脚步声。不，不是，原来只是闹钟嘀嗒声，弄得他虚惊一场。</p></li>
<li><p>于是，他再度鼓起勇气，小心翼翼地拿了一颗甜美的樱桃。他已经下定决心，只拿一颗。他将樱桃放进嘴里：那樱桃味道实在是太美味了。于是，他又说服自己，哪怕再拿一颗也不会有人发现的。于是他又拿了一颗，迅速扔进自己嘴里。</p></li>
<li><p>可是，老绅士在樱桃盘里摆了几颗假樱桃，里面装满了辣椒粉。亨利不巧吃到其中一颗，那辛辣呛鼻的味道令他实在无法忍受。老先生听到他的咳嗽声，便已洞悉了这边发生的事情。一个拿取不属于自己东西的男孩，哪怕只拿走一颗樱桃，都不是他想要的人。亨利·威尔金斯被毫不迟延地当场辞退了，当时他仍口腔冒火，嘴里辣得像塞了一块燃煤。</p></li>
<li><p>下一个被带进房间的是鲁弗斯·威尔逊。不到十分钟，他便开始在房间里四下走动。他的性格勇敢而果断，但并没有什么原则。要是不被发现的话，他就可能打开房间里的每一个橱柜、衣柜、抽屉，无须任何踌躇或犹豫。</p></li>
<li><p>鲁弗斯环顾着这个房间，他看到桌子上有个抽屉，就决定打开往里看看。没想到，当他一抓住抽屉把手时，他就触碰到桌子底下隐藏的一个大响铃，旋即铃声大作。老先生很快回应了这声响铃，进入了房间。</p></li>
<li><p>铃声响起得太突然，鲁弗斯被吓得惊慌失措，哪怕他脸皮再厚，也无法自圆其说。他看起来那么不堪一击，似乎一根羽毛都能将他击倒。老先生问他是否需要什么才揿动响铃，鲁弗斯结结巴巴地说不出话来，试图为自己找借口，但都没有任何意义，最终还是没能逃脱被要求离开的结局。</p></li>
<li><p>接下来，一个老管家把乔治·琼斯领进这个房间。这是个谨慎的孩子，他什么也不触碰，只用眼光横扫室内一圈。最后，他看到了衣柜的柜门露出了一道缝隙。他想，要是他将这个缝隙稍稍开大些，也不会被人发现，因此，他看了看柜门下方，确信它不会碰到什么东西或发出噪音，然后很谨慎地将柜门拉开了一点点。</p></li>
<li><p>要是他当时查看的是柜门顶端，而不是柜门下方，情况可能会更好些。因为柜门顶上固定着一个塞子，而这个塞子正堵着一管铅弹。当乔治一点点将柜门拉开的时候，塞子脱离了管口，铅弹粒顿时四下飞溅。衣柜下方，放着一个锡盘，倾泻而下的铅弹粒落在锡盘里，噼里啪啦地清脆声响个不同，乔治被这一突发事件吓得魂不守舍。</p></li>
<li><p>老先生很快走进房间，询问发生了什么事。乔治脸色苍白如纸，很快便被打发回家。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，被带到房间里的是阿尔伯特·詹金斯。被淘汰的男孩通过不同的路径被辞退回家，所以，没有人知道其他人在那间试练之屋里经历过什么。</p></li>
<li><p>桌上放着一个小圆盒，盒盖上拧着一颗螺丝。阿尔伯特心想，这个盒子里一定装着些什么有趣的东西；要是不拧松螺丝，便没法打开盒子。但是，他刚刚拧开螺丝，盒子里突然弹出一条假蛇，足足有一码长，落在他的手臂上。他吓得后退了几步，大声尖叫起来。老先生很快被尖叫声引来抓住阿尔伯特的手，在他眼前，阿尔伯特一只手拿着盒子，另一只手拿着盒盖，那条假蛇掉在地上，一动不动。</p></li>
<li><p>“得了，得了，”老先生说，“家里有一条蛇就足够了。至于你，离开得越早越好。”一边说着，老先生一边命人将他带走，连解释的机会都不给他。</p></li>
<li><p>下一个被带入房间的是威廉·史密斯。仆人将他单独留在那儿，他很快便开始打量着身旁这些有趣的东西。威廉不仅好奇心重，喜欢窥探他人隐私，而且也不太诚实。当他发现书柜抽屉上留下的钥匙，他便蹑手蹑脚地走过去。不幸的是，这把钥匙与金属线固定在一起，而金属线则连接着一台电机。当威廉碰到钥匙，他立即就遭到电击，这样的疼痛大概会令他终生难忘。等他终于缓过神来，有力气抬腿走路的时候，他便被告知离开这座庄园。至于抽屉是开是关，那就是抽屉主人的事了。</p></li>
<li><p>最后一个被带进房间的男孩是哈利·戈登。虽然他被留在房间里整整二十分钟，他只是安静坐在椅子上，从未离开。虽然与其他男孩一样，哈利也能看见身旁有趣的东西，但是，他比其他男孩更诚实正直。桌上的盘罩、樱桃、抽屉把手、衣柜门、小圆盒或是书柜抽屉上的钥匙，都没能诱惑他，让他从椅子上站起来。最后，当他在椅子上坐了足足半小时后，老先生决定雇佣他，留在榆树山庄。哈利一直跟随着这位好心的老先生，为他养老送终。老先生死后，哈利因他正直的行为举止而获得了大笔遗产。</p></li>

<p>THE MANIAC</p>
<p>疯 子</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A gentleman who had traveled in Europe, relates that he one day
visited the hospital of Berlin, where he saw a man whose exterior [1]
was very striking. His figure, tall and commanding, was bending with
age, but more with sorrow; the few scattered hairs which remained on his
temples were white almost as the driven snow, and the deepest melancholy
was depicted [2] in his countenance.</p></li>
<li><p>On inquiring who he was and what brought him there, he started,
as, if from sleep, and, after looking around him, began with slow and
measured steps to stride the hall, repeating in a low but audible voice,
“Once one is two; once one is two.”</p></li>
<li><p>Now and then he would stop, and remain with his arms folded on
his breast as if in contemplation [3] , for some minutes; then again
resuming his walk, he continued to repeat, “Once one is two; once one is
two.” His story, as our traveler understood it, is as follows:</p></li>
<li><p>Conrad Lange, collector of the revenues [4] of the city of
Berlin, had long been known as a man whom nothing could divert from the
paths of honesty. Scrupulously [5] exact in all his dealings, and
assiduous [6] in the discharge of all his duties, he had acquired the
good will and esteem of all who knew him, and the confidence of the
minister of finance [7] , whose duty it is to inspect the accounts of
all officers connected with the revenue.</p></li>
<li><p>On casting up his accounts at the close of a particular year, he
found a deficit [8] of ten thousand ducats [9] . Alarmed at this
discovery, he went to the minister, presented his accounts, and informed
him that he did not know how it had arisen, and that he had been robbed
by some person bent on his ruin.</p></li>
<li><p>The minister received his accounts, but thinking it a duty to
secure a person who might probably be a defaulter [10] , he caused him
to be arrested, and put his accounts into the hands of one of his
secretaries for inspection, who returned them the day after with the
information that the deficiency arose from a miscalculation; that in
multiplying, Mr. Lange had said, once one is two , instead of once one
is one .</p></li>
<li><p>The poor man was immediately released from confinement, his
accounts returned, and the mistake pointed out. During his imprisonment,
which lasted two days, he had neither eaten, drunk, nor taken any
repose; and when he appeared, his countenance was as pale as death. On
receiving his accounts, he was a long time silent; then suddenly
awaking, as if from a trance, he repeated, “Once one is two.”</p></li>
<li><p>He appeared to be entirely insensible of his situation; would
neither eat nor drink, unless solicited; and took notice of nothing that
passed around him. While repeating his accustomed phrase, if anyone
corrected him by saying, “Once one is one ,” his attention was arrested
for a moment, and he said, “Ah, right, once one is one;” and then
resuming his walk, he continued to repeat, “Once one is two.” He died
shortly after the traveler left Berlin.</p></li>
<li><p>This affecting story, whether true or untrue, obviously [11]
abounds with lessons of instruction. Alas! how easily is the human mind
thrown off its balance; especially when it is stayed on this world only,
and has no experimental knowledge of the meaning of the injunction [12]
of Scripture, to cast all our cares upon Him who careth for us, and who
heareth even the young ravens when they cry.</p></li>

<li><p>一位游历欧洲的绅士说起，他曾参观了一家柏林的医院。在那里，他遇见一位外表吓人的男人。他身材高大，器宇轩昂，但身体却因衰老而微微弯曲，举手投足间满溢着悲伤。他鬓角的几丝头发已近雪白，忧郁深深地刻在面容上。</p></li>
<li><p>这位绅士询问他是谁，为什么在那里。这个男人像是突然从梦中惊醒一般，环顾四周后，开始用缓慢而不失标准的步伐在大厅里来回踱步，一边走，一边用一种勉强能被听见的声音反复嘟囔着：“一一得二，一一得二。”</p></li>
<li><p>他偶尔会停下，手臂仍然环抱在胸前，仿佛陷入沉思。这样过了几分钟，他又开始踱步，嘴里仍然反复嘟囔着：“一一得二，一一得二。”根据我们这位绅士的理解，这个男人的故事是这样的：</p></li>
<li><p>他叫康拉德·兰格，曾是柏林市的税收官。多年来，他为人正派，极富声望。他一丝不苟地处理账目，勤勤恳恳地履行职责，并以此获得所有熟人的赞誉和尊敬，以及财政部部长的充分信任，后者的职责是监督所有财政官员的账目。</p></li>
<li><p>一个不同寻常的年末，康拉德清理完他手头负责的所有账本后，突然发现账面上出现了一万元的亏空。他大为惊愕，去面见了财政部长，提交了所有账目报告，并告诉部长他丝毫不知道这是怎么发生的，一定是某些蓄意陷害他的人故意栽赃。</p></li>
<li><p>部长收下他的账目报告，但认为自己有责任将一名涉嫌侵贪的官员羁押在案。在部长授意下，康拉德被逮捕，而他经手的所有账本由他原先的下属稽查。第二天，下属便查明了亏空的原因：计算错误。正如故事开头康拉德嘴里念叨的那样，在做乘法的时候，他错误地认为“一一得二”，而不是“一一得一”。</p></li>
<li><p>这个可怜的人被立即释放，所有账本被归还给他，账面上的错误也被纠正了。被监禁的那两天，他不吃不喝，也不肯休息。从监狱里释放出来的时候，康拉德面如死灰。当他接过账本后，他沉默了很久，然后，仿佛从梦中突然清醒过来，他开始反复嘟囔着：“一一得二。”</p></li>
<li><p>他似乎完全感受不到身边的情况，他还是不吃不喝，除非人家央求他；即使有什么经过他身边，他也茫然无知。他一遍又一遍地嘟囔着同样的话，如果有人纠正他：“一一得一。”他会清醒片刻，然后说，“啊，对啊，一一得一。”接着，他又开始反复踱步，继续嘟囔着：“一一得二。”那位旅行者离开柏林后不久，康拉德便死了。</p></li>
<li><p>这个故事让人唏嘘不已。无论它是否真实，都明显蕴藏着深刻的指导意义。唉，人的心智多么容易失衡啊！尤其当我们的心只着眼于现世，而不去思考《圣经》里的训诫警示，不去全心全意地敬靠那位爱我们、倾听我们痛苦哭泣的上帝的时候。</p></li>

<p>John Greenleaf Whittier was born near Haverhill, Mass., in 1807, and
died at Hampton Falls, N.H., in 1892. His boyhood was passed on a farm,
and he never received a classical education. In 1829 he edited a
newspaper in Boston. In the following year he removed to Hartford,
Conn., to assume a similar position. In 1836 he edited an antislavery
paper in Philadelphia. In 1840 he removed to Amesbury, Mass.
Mr. Whittier’s parents were Friends, and he always held to the same
faith. He wrote extensively both in prose and verse. As a poet, he
ranked among those most highly esteemed and honored by his countrymen.
“Snow Bound” is one of the longest and best of his poems.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Our bachelor uncle who lived with us was a quiet, genial [1] man,
much given to hunting and fishing; and it was one of the pleasures of
our young life to accompany him on his expeditions to Great Hill,
Brandy-brow Woods, the Pond, and, best of all, to the Country Brook. We
were quite willing to work hard in the cornfield or the haying lot to
finish the necessary day’s labor in season for an afternoon stroll
through the woods and along the brookside.</p></li>
<li><p>I remember my first fishing excursion as if it were but
yesterday. I have been happy many times in my life, but never more
intensely so than when I received that first fishing pole from my
uncle’s hand, and trudged off with him through the woods and meadows. It
was a still, sweet day of early summer; the long afternoon shadows of
the trees lay cool across our path; the leaves seemed greener, the
flowers brighter, the birds merrier, than ever before.</p></li>
<li><p>My uncle, who knew by long experience where were the best haunts
[2] of pickerel, considerately [3] placed me at the most favorable
point. I threw out my line as I had so often seen others, and waited
anxiously for a bite, moving the bait in rapid jerks on the surface of
the water in imitation of the leap of a frog. Nothing came of it. “Try
again,” said my uncle. Suddenly the bait sank out of sight. “Now for
it,” thought I; “here is a fish at last.”</p></li>
<li><p>I made a strong pull, and brought up a tangle of weeds. Again and
again I cast out my line with aching arms, and drew it back empty. I
looked at my uncle appealingly [4] . “Try once more,” he said; “we
fishermen must have patience.”</p></li>
<li><p>Suddenly something tugged at my line, and swept off with it into
deep water. Jerking it up, I saw a fine pickerel wriggling in the sun.
“Uncle!” I cried, looking back in uncontrollable excitement, “I’ve got a
fish!” “Not yet,” said my uncle. As he spoke there was a plash in the
water; I caught the arrowy gleam of a scared fish shooting into the
middle of the stream, my hook hung empty from the line. I had lost my
prize.</p></li>
<li><p>We are apt to speak of the sorrows of childhood as trifles in
comparison with those of grown-up people; but we may depend upon it the
young folks don’t agree with us. Our griefs, modified [5] and restrained
by reason, experience, and self-respect, keep the proprieties [6] , and,
if possible, avoid a scene; but the sorrow of childhood, unreasoning and
all-absorbing [7] , is a complete abandonment to the passion. The doll’s
nose is broken, and the world breaks up with it; the marble rolls out of
sight, and the solid globe rolls off with the marble.</p></li>
<li><p>So, overcome with my great and bitter disappointment, I sat down
on the nearest hassock [8] , and for a time refused to be comforted,
even by my uncle’s assurance that there were more fish in the brook. He
refitted my bait, and, putting the pole again in my hands, told me to
try my luck once more.</p></li>
<li><p>“But remember, boy,” he said, with his shrewd smile, “never brag
of catching a fish until he is on dry ground. I’ve seen older folks
doing that in more ways than one, and so making fools of themselves.
It’s no use to boast of anything until it’s done, nor then, either, for
it speaks for itself.”</p></li>
<li><p>How often since I have been reminded of the fish that I did not
catch. When I hear people boasting of a work as yet undone, and trying
to anticipate [9] the credit which belongs only to actual achievement
[10] , I call to mind that scene by the brookside, and the wise caution
of my uncle in that particular instance takes the form of a proverb of
universal application: “NEVER BRAG OF YOUR FISH BEFORE YOU CATCH
HIM.”</p></li>

<p>1807年，约翰·格林利夫·惠蒂尔出生于美国马萨诸塞州黑弗利尔市附近，1892年他在新罕布什尔州汉普顿大瀑布镇去世。他的少年时期在农场度过，从未接受过任何传统教育。
1829年，他在波士顿担任一份报纸的编辑，翌年，他搬到康涅狄格州哈特福德市，仍旧从事编辑工作。
1836年，他在费城参与一份反奴隶制报纸的编辑工作。
1840年，他又迁回马萨诸塞州埃姆斯伯里市。惠蒂尔的父母是基督教公教会信徒，他也秉持同样信念。他写了大量的散文和诗歌，是美国最负声望及受人爱戴的诗人之一，《大雪封门》是他篇幅最长、最受喜爱的一篇诗歌作品。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>与我们全家共同生活的鳏夫叔叔沉默寡言，性情温和，狩猎或垂钓占据他生活中大多时光。跟随他一起到处郊游远足，是我们年少时最大的乐趣之一，我们的足迹遍及格瑞特山、布兰迪山坡树林、大湖以及最让我们雀跃欢呼的康瑞河。我们总是乐意在玉米田或干草垛边努力干活，忙完这个季节里必要的当天活计，就为了换来一个和他一起漫步树林间或溪流旁的下午。</p></li>
<li><p>我清晰地记得我第一次钓鱼远足的情形，恍若昨日发生的事情。在我一生中，曾有过许多幸福时光，但从没有过比我第一次从叔叔手里接过钓鱼竿时更强烈的喜悦。我将钓竿扛在背上，随他穿过簇簇丛林，涉过翻飞草场，一路跋涉步履艰难。那时正值初夏，空气中充满了静谧和芬芳，我们走在夏日午后漫长的树荫里，一路阴凉，叶子看起来比以往任何时候都更绿，野花更鲜艳，鸟儿也鸣啾得更为动听。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>3,
叔叔经验丰富，深知梭鱼出没之地，他体贴地帮我选好上佳的垂钓地方。平日经常观看他人钓鱼，我也学着别人模样，甩出钓竿上的鱼线，然后焦急地等待着鱼儿咬钩，还不时模仿着青蛙蹦跳的姿势，在水面上猛拽鱼饵。许久，也没见一条鱼儿上钩。“再试试。”叔叔对我叫道。突然，鱼饵沉入水下。“有了，”我心头一喜，“终于有鱼儿咬钩了！”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>我猛然拉动鱼竿，拽出的却是缠成一团的水草。我一次又一次将钓线甩入河中，手臂开始酸痛，却仍然一无所获。我用求救的眼神看了看叔叔。“再试一次，”他说，“钓鱼的人需要格外有耐心。”</p></li>
<li><p>忽然，有东西拽住我的鱼线，并扯着它往水里潜去。我猛地拉起鱼竿，看见一条肥硕的梭鱼在阳光下扭动着身子。“叔叔！”我高声叫道，抑制不住满心激动地扭头看他。“我钓到了一条大鱼！”“还没这么早。”叔叔的话音未落，刹那间，水面溅起水花，我转过头，只见一道箭矢般的银光划过，这条惊慌的大鱼笔直跃入水中。我手上的那柄钓竿上，只留下空空的饵钩，我失去了我的战利品。</p></li>
<li><p>成年以后，我们极易谈及孩提时代的懊恼，与成年后的悲伤相比，尽管鸡毛蒜皮，根本不值一提，但总会令人耿耿于怀。当然，年轻人看来每每不以为然。成年后的悲痛，受到理性、经验、自尊的修正和限制，要尊重社会的习俗传统，如果可能的话，还要避免在别人面前出丑。然而，孩提时代缺乏理性，沉湎痛苦难以自拔，任由性情恣意崩溃和放纵。洋娃娃的鼻子破了，整个世界随之破碎；石弹珠不知道滚到哪儿去了，整个天地也接着塌陷。</p></li>
<li><p>于是，我被强烈的苦涩失望所攫取，一屁股颓然瘫坐在最近的草丛里。有那么一会儿，我根本不想听到安慰，哪怕是我叔叔再三向我保证，河里还有很多鱼。他重新装好我的鱼饵，把钓竿再次放在我的手里，嘱咐我再试试手气。</p></li>
<li><p>“但是，请记住，孩子，”他说着，脸上露出狡黠笑意，“直到鱼儿躺在干燥的地面之前，都别吹嘘你钓到了鱼。我曾见过许多年纪比你大的人用各种方式吹嘘自己还没做到的事，结果只是当众出丑。记住，八字还没有一撇的时候，吹嘘是没有意义的；哪怕事情成功以后，也没必要吹嘘，因为到那时，你所获得的成就不言而喻。”</p></li>
<li><p>从那以后，我曾无数次想起这条我没钓到的鱼。当我听到人们吐沫四溅地夸口自己遥遥无期的奋斗目标，幻想着成功唾手可得的时候，河边钓鱼的场景再度浮现。那时，叔叔曾用一句谚语，睿智地指点了我的人生：“在鱼到手之前，绝不要吹嘘自己钓到了鱼。”</p></li>

maiden name was Buell. In 1814 she married David Hale, an eminent
lawyer, who died in 1822. Left with five children to support, she turned
her attention to literature. In 1828 she became editor of the “Ladies’
Magazine.” In 1837 this periodical was united with “Godey’s Lady’s

<li><p>In the city of Bath, not many years since, lived a barber who
made a practice of following his ordinary occupation on the Lord’s day.
As he was on the way to his morning’s employment, he happened to look
into some place of worship just as the minister was giving out his
text—”Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” He listened long
enough to be convinced that he was constantly breaking the laws of God
and man by shaving and dressing his customers on the Lord’s day. He
became uneasy, and went with a heavy heart to his Sabbath task.</p></li>
<li><p>At length he took courage, and opened his mind to his minister,
who advised him to give up Sabbath work, and worship God. He replied
that beggary would be the consequence. He had a flourishing trade, but
it would almost all be lost. At length, after many a sleepless night
spent in weeping and praying, he was determined to cast all his care
upon God, as the more he reflected, the more his duty became apparent
[1] .</p></li>
<li><p>He discontinued his Sabbath work, went constantly and early to
the public services of religion, and soon enjoyed that satisfaction of
mind which is one of the rewards of doing our duty, and that peace which
the world can neither give nor take away. The consequences he foresaw
actually followed. His genteel [2] customers left him, and he was
nicknamed “Puritan” or “Methodist.” He was obliged to give up his
fashionable shop, and, in the course of years, became so reduced [3] as
to take a cellar under the old market house and shave the poorer
people.</p></li>
<li><p>One Saturday evening, between light and dark, a stranger from one
of the coaches, asking for a barber, was directed by the hostler to the
cellar opposite. Coming in hastily, he requested to be shaved quickly,
while they changed horses, as he did not like to violate [4] the
Sabbath. This was touching the barber on a tender chord. He burst into
tears; asked the stranger to lend him a half-penny to buy a candle, as
it was not light enough to shave him with safety. He did so, revolving
in his mind the extreme poverty to which the poor man must be
reduced.</p></li>
<li><p>When shaved, he said, “There must be something extraordinary in
your history, which I have not now time to hear. Here is half a crown
for you. When I return, I will call and investigate [5] your case. What
is your name?” “William Reed,” said the astonished barber. “William
Reed?” echoed the stranger: “William Reed? by your dialect [6] you are
from the West.” “Yes, sir, from Kingston, near Taunton.” “William Reed
from Kingston, near Taunton? What was your father’s name?” “Thomas.”
“Had he any brother?” “Yes, sir, one, after whom I was named; but he
went to the Indies, and, as we never heard from him, we supposed him to
be dead.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Come along, follow me,” said the stranger, “I am going to see a
person who says his name is William Reed, of Kingston, near Taunton.
Come and confront [7] him. If you prove to be indeed he who you say you
are, I have glorious news for you. Your uncle is dead, and has left an
immense fortune, which I will put you in possession of when all legal
doubts are removed.”</p></li>
<li><p>They went by the coach; saw the pretended William Reed, and
proved him to be an impostor. The stranger, who was a pious attorney [8]
, was soon legally satisfied of the barber’s identity [9] , and told him
that he had advertised him in vain. Providence had now thrown him in his
way in a most extraordinary manner, and he had great pleasure in
transferring [10] a great many thousand pounds to a worthy man, the
rightful heir of the property. Thus was man’s extremity [11] God’s
opportunity [12] . Had the poor barber possessed one half-penny, or even
had credit for a candle, he might have remained unknown for years; but
he trusted God, who never said, “Seek ye my face,” in vain.</p></li>

<li><p>在巴斯城里，住着一位理发师。几年前，他始终保持着星期日不休息、照常工作的习惯。某个周日早晨，在去理发店的路上，他偶然看见一处教会敬拜的场所，牧师正在分发布道经文——“纪念安息日，请维护它的神圣。”他听了很久，终于相信自己所作所为确实违背了上帝与人类的律法，安息日里，他竟然还在为顾客打理胡须、修剪头发，想到这里，他开始变得不安，心情沉重地前去工作。</p></li>
<li><p>终于，他鼓起勇气，向牧师袒露了他的忧虑。牧师建议他在安息日停止工作，敬拜上帝。他回答道，如果不在安息日工作的话，他大概就得四处乞讨了。他那曾经蒸蒸日上的事业，很快便会失去。他在哭泣和祈祷中度过了一个个不眠之夜，他最终决定，全身心地信奉上帝，越是反省深思，他越觉得上帝赋予他的职责至关重要。</p></li>
<li><p>从此以后，每逢安息日，他不再工作，总是早起去参加教会礼拜。很快，他便感受到内心的平安喜乐，这种安宁的心态是对履行我们职责的回报，既不能由别人给予，也无法被他人夺走。当然，他曾预见到的后果也随之而来。上流社会的顾客们纷纷离他而去，他甚至还被封了“清教徒”、“卫道士”的绰号。他被迫卖掉自己那间时尚理发店，随后的日子里，生活日渐窘迫，他不得不租了一间破旧市场的地下室，为穷人理发剃须。</p></li>
<li><p>一个星期六的晚上，夜幕刚刚降临，有个陌生人从马车上走下来，想找一位理发师，住在理发店对面的马夫将他带到这里。客人匆忙地走进小店，要求理发师趁着马夫换马的工夫，迅速帮他打理一下，因为他不想违背安息日的规矩。这话触动了理发师心里柔软的地方，顿时让他泪流满面。屋里太黑，他唯恐做起活来不稳当，只好开口向客人先支借半便士来买根蜡烛。客人拿出半便士给他，理发师这么穷困潦倒，客人不禁陷入沉思。</p></li>
<li><p>理完发后，客人说：“你的经历一定很特别，我很感兴趣，但现在没有时间倾听，先付你两个半便士。等我回来的时候，我再找你好好聊聊。你叫什么名字？”“威廉·瑞德。”理发师回答道，心里有点吃惊。“威廉·瑞德？”陌生人不可置信地重复了一遍，“威廉·瑞德？你的方言听起来，好像是从西边来的？”“是的，先生，我出生在陶顿附近的金士顿。”“从陶顿附近的金士顿来的威廉·瑞德？你父亲叫什么名字？”“托马斯。”“他有兄弟吗？”“是的，先生，他有一个兄弟，我的名字便是用来纪念他的。但他去了西印度群岛，此后就再无音讯了。我们猜想，他大概已经不在人世了。”</p></li>
<li><p>“来吧，跟我来，”陌生人说，“我正要去见一个自称从陶顿附近的金士顿来的名叫威廉·瑞德的人。你跟着我，来和他当面对质。如果你能证明你才是这个人，我可有个天大的好消息要告诉你。你的叔叔去世了，留下了一笔巨额财富。如果你所言不虚，通过所有相关的法律认证，你便可以继承这笔财产。”</p></li>
<li><p>于是，他们乘着马车去见了那个冒牌的威廉·瑞德，证实了他是一个骗子。不久以后，这名陌生人——事实证明他是一名尽职的律师，很快获得理发师的合法身份证明。他告诉理发师自己曾登出广告寻找，却一无所获。如今天如人意，竟用最不寻常的方式将真正的威廉·瑞德带到他的眼前，他很高兴能将这笔巨额财富移交给一个值得拥有的人，这笔遗产的合法继承者。逆境是上帝考验人的良机，如果当时那个可怜的理发师拥有半便士，哪怕是拥有欠钱买蜡烛的信用，律师可能都还要花很长时间才能找到他。但是，他相信上帝。上帝说，“你们当寻求我的面”，这话绝非虚言。</p></li>

<p>Charles Kingsley (b.1819, d.1875) was born at Holne, Devonshire,
England. He took his bachelor’s degree at Cambridge in 1842, and soon
after entered the Church. His writings are quite voluminous, including
sermons, lectures, novels, fairy tales, and poems, published in book
form, besides numerous miscellaneous sermons and magazine articles. He
was an earnest worker for bettering the condition of the working
classes, and this object was the basis of most of his writings. As a
lyric poet he has gained a high place. The “Saint’s Tragedy” and
“Andromeda” are the most pretentious of his poems, and “Alton Locke” and
“Hypatia” are his best known novels.</p>

<li><p>O give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name; make known his
deeds among the people. Sing unto him; sing psalms unto him; talk ye of
all his wondrous works. Glory ye in his holy name; let the heart of them
rejoice that seek the Lord. Remember his marvelous [1] works that he
hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.</p></li>
<li><p>O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who
hast set thy glory above the heavens. When I consider thy heavens, the
work of thy fingers; the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained [2]
; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that
thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the
angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor. Thou madest him to
have dominion [3] over the work of thy hands; thou hast put all things
under his feet. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the
earth!</p></li>
<li><p>I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God;
in him will I trust. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore
will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my
name. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him
in trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him. With long life will I
satisfy him, and show him my salvation.</p></li>
<li><p>O come, let us sing unto the Lord, let us heartily rejoice in the
strength of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with
thanksgiving, and show ourselves glad in him with psalms. For the Lord
is a great God, and a great King above all gods. O worship the Lord in
the beauty of holiness; let the whole earth stand in awe of him. For he
cometh, for he cometh, to judge the earth; and with righteousness to
judge the world, and the people with his truth.</p></li>
<li><p>Oh that men would praise the Lord’ for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men! They that go down to the sea in
ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the
Lord, and his wonders in the deep. For he commandeth, and raiseth the
stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the
heaven; they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because
of trouble; they reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and
are at their wit’s end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble,
and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a
calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because
they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven ① . Oh that
men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works
to the children of men!</p></li>
<li><p>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters. He
restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his
name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of
mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and
I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.</p></li>

WORM·致命毒虫</h2>
<h2 id="lesson-17-3">LESSON 17</h2>
<p>THE VENOMOUS WORM</p>
<p>致命毒虫</p>
<p>John Russell (b. 1793, d. 1863) graduated at Middlebury College, Vt.,
in 1818. He was at one time editor of the “Backwoodsman,” published at
Grafton, Ill., and later of the “Louisville Advocate.” He was the author
of many tales of western adventure and of numerous essays, sketches,
etc. His language is clear, chaste, and classical; his style concise,
vigorous, and sometimes highly ornate.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Who has not heard of the rattlesnake or copperhead? An unexpected
sight of either of these reptiles [1] will make even the lords of
creation recoil [2] ; but there is a species of worm, found in various
parts of this country, which conveys a poison of a nature so deadly
that, compared with it, even the venom of the rattlesnake is harmless.
To guard our readers against this foe of human kind is the object of
this lesson.</p></li>
<li><p>This worm varies much in size. It is frequently an inch in
diameter, but, as it is rarely seen except when coiled, its length can
hardly be conjectured. It is of a dull lead color, and generally lives
near a spring or small stream of water, and bites the unfortunate people
who are in the habit of going there to drink. The brute creation it
never molests. They avoid it with the same instinct that teaches the
animals of India to shun the deadly cobra [3] .</p></li>
<li><p>Several of these reptiles have long infested [4] our settlements,
to the misery and destruction of many of our fellow citizens. I have,
therefore, had frequent opportunities of being the melancholy spectator
of the effects produced by the subtile [5] poison which this worm
infuses [6] .</p></li>
<li><p>The symptoms of its bite are terrible. The eyes of the patient
become red and fiery, his tongue swells to an immoderate size, and
obstructs [7] his utterance; and delirium [8] of the most horrid
character quickly follows. Sometimes, in his madness, he attempts the
destruction of his nearest friends.</p></li>
<li><p>If the sufferer has a family, his weeping wife and helpless
infants are not unfrequently the objects of his frantic fury. In a word,
he exhibits, to the life, all the detestable passions that rankle [9] in
the bosom of a savage; and such is the spell in which his senses are
locked, that no sooner has the unhappy patient recovered from the
paroxysm [10] of insanity occasioned by the bite, than he seeks out the
destroyer for the sole purpose of being bitten again.</p></li>
<li><p>I have seen a good old father, his locks as white as snow, his
step slow and trembling, beg in vain of his only son to quit the lurking
place of the worm. My heart bled when he turned away; for I knew the
fond hope that his son would be the “staff of his declining years,” had
supported him through many a sorrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Youths of America, would you know the name of this reptile? It is
called the WORM [11] OF THE STILL [12] . [13]</p></li>

<p>约翰·罗素（1793—1863）于1818年毕业于美国佛蒙特州米德尔伯里学院。他曾担任在伊利诺伊州格拉夫顿市出版的《蛮荒者》杂志的编辑，随后成为《路易斯维尔之声》的编辑。他曾写过许多西部冒险小说，以及大量的杂文和随笔。他的语言清晰干净，遣词造句传统古典，文风简洁热情，但有时辞藻过于华丽。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>可有人不曾听说过响尾蛇或铜斑蛇？要是在不经意间看到这两种虫豸，哪怕是造物主都会在它们面前惊恐畏缩。但是，这世上还有另一种蠕虫，这种蠕虫在美国各地已相继被发现，它身上能分泌出致命的毒素，与这种剧毒相比，响尾蛇的毒液都算得上温和无害。本文旨在指导读者如何防备这个危害人类生命的致命敌人。</p></li>
<li><p>这种蠕虫的体型差异很大。它的直径常常能达到一英寸，但是，由于这种蠕虫常常盘绕成团，很少有人见过它完全舒展开来的样子，因此很难估测它的实际长度。这种蠕虫呈暗铅色，通常盘踞在泉水或细小溪流附近，并在不经意间叮咬那些前去饮水的不幸的人。它从不骚扰那些凶猛的野兽，因为那些猛兽本能地避开它，正如印度动物本能地避开致命的眼镜蛇那样。</p></li>
<li><p>这种致命的爬行虫豸当中，有许多蠕虫已经长期侵扰人类的住处，给人们带来痛苦与灾难。这种蠕虫只需刺入人体极少或微量毒液，便足以给人带来不可避免的悲剧。不幸的是，这类受害者对我来说，实在是司空见惯。</p></li>
<li><p>被这种毒虫咬伤后的症状极其可怕。受害者的眼睛变得红肿而炙热，舌头过度肿胀，连发音都变得含糊，紧接着会产生可怕的幻觉。处于癫狂状态下的受害者，甚至会攻击身边最亲密的朋友。</p></li>
<li><p>如果受害者有家小，他哭泣的妻子和无助的婴儿便不可避免地成为他狂暴时攻击的对象。换句话说，他会无法遏制地表现出野蛮内心的疯狂情绪，在这种时候，他感觉不到外界的反应。哪怕受害者间歇性地从被虫豸啮噬后的癫狂状态中苏醒，他仍会疯狂地寻找这种毒虫，就为了再度被它啮噬。</p></li>
<li><p>我曾经见过一位慈祥的年迈父亲，他的鬓发近乎雪白，步履颤抖蹒跚，却仍然徒劳地苦苦央求他唯一的儿子离开那毒虫盘踞的场所。当他艰难地转身离开时，我的心在滴血。我知道，他仍然幻想着儿子是他“垂暮之年的唯一依靠”，而这种幻想，曾伴随他度过许多悲痛的时刻。</p></li>
<li><p>美国的年轻人们，你们可知道这种毒虫叫什么名字？它就是鸦片。</p></li>

<p>THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM</p>
<p>布伦海姆战役</p>
<p>Robert Southey (b. 1774, d. 1843) was born in Bristol, England. He
entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1793. In 1804 he established himself
permanently at Greta Hall, near Keswick, Cumberland, in the “Lake
Country,” where he enjoyed the friendship and society of Wordsworth and
Coleridge, other poets of the “Lake School.” He was appointed poet
laureate in 1813, and received a pension of £300 a year from the
government in 1835. Mr. Southey was a voluminous writer in both prose
and verse. As a poet, he can not be placed in the first rank, although
some of his minor poems are very happy in thought and expression. Among
his most noted poetical works are “Joan of Arc,” “Thalaba the
Destroyer,” “Madoc,” “Roderick,” and the “Curse of Kehama.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It was a summer evening,</li>
</ol>
<p>Old Kaspar’s work was done,</p>
<p>And he, before his cottage door,</p>
<p>Was sitting in the sun;</p>
<p>And by him sported on the green,</p>
<p>His little grandchild Wilhelmine.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>She saw her brother Peterkin</li>
</ol>
<p>Roll something large and round,</p>
<p>Which he beside the rivulet,</p>
<p>In playing there, had found;</p>
<p>He came to ask what he had found,</p>
<p>That was so large, and smooth, and round.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Old Kaspar took it from the boy,</li>
</ol>
<p>Who stood expectant by;</p>
<p>And then the old man shook his head,</p>
<p>And, with a natural sigh,</p>
<p>“ ’T is some poor fellow’s skull,” said he,</p>
<p>“Who fell in the great victory.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>“I find them in the garden,</li>
</ol>
<p>For there’s many hereabout;</p>

<p>For many thousand men,” said he,</p>
<p>“Were slain in that great victory.”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>“Now tell us what ’t was all about,”</li>
</ol>
<p>Young Peterkin he cries;</p>

<p>“Now tell us all about the war,</p>
<p>And what they killed each other for.”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>“It was the English,” Kaspar cried,</li>
</ol>
<p>“Who put the French to rout,</p>

</ol>
<p>Yon little stream, hard by;</p>

<p>Nor had he where to rest his head.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>“With fire and sword, the country round</li>

<p>But things like that, you know, must be</p>
<p>At every famous victory.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>“They say it was a shocking sight</li>
</ol>
<p>After the field was won;</p>
<p>For many thousand bodies here</p>
<p>Lay rotting in the sun:</p>
<p>But things like that, you know, must be</p>
<p>After a famous victory.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>“Great praise the Duke of Marlboro’ won,</li>
</ol>
<p>And our young prince, Eugene.”</p>
<p>“Why, ’t was a very wicked thing!”</p>
<p>Said little Wilhelmine.</p>
<p>“Nay, nay, my little girl!” quoth he,</p>
<p>“It was a famous victory.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>“And everybody praised the Duke</li>
</ol>
<p>Who this great fight did win.”</p>
<p>“But what good came of it at last?”</p>
<p>Quoth little Peterkin.</p>
<p>“Why, that I can not tell,” said he,</p>
<p>“But ’t was a glorious victory.”</p>
<p>NOTES.—The Battle of Blenheim, in the “War of the Spanish
Succession,” was fought August 13, 1704, near Blenheim, in Bavaria,
between the French and Bavarians, on one Ride, and an allied army under
the great English general, the Duke of Marlborough, and Eugene, Prince
of Savoy, on the other. The latter won a decisive victory: 10,000 of the
defeated army were killed and wounded, and 13,000 were taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>罗伯特·骚塞（1774—1843）出生于英国布里斯托尔市。
1793年，他进入牛津大学贝利奥尔学院。
1804年，他在靠近坎伯兰郡凯斯维克，也就是“湖泊区”附近的葛雷塔会馆定居下来，并终生住在这里。在这里，他与华兹华斯和柯勒律治以及其他一些“湖畔派”诗人结下了深厚的友谊，骚塞、华兹华斯和柯勒律治被称为“湖畔派”诗人。
1813年，他被封为“桂冠诗人”，
1835年，他开始接受英国政府授予的每年三百英镑的文学年金。骚塞一生著述颇丰，写有大量散文和诗歌。作为一名诗人，他或许不能荣忝一流，尽管他的某些短小篇幅诗歌在思想和艺术表达上相当成功。他最著名的诗作包括《圣女贞德》、《毁灭者撒拉巴》、《麦道克王子》、《罗德里克》和《克哈玛的诅咒》。</p>

<li><p>A poor man once undertook to emigrate [1] from Castine, Me., to
Illinois. When he was attempting to cross a river in New York, his horse
broke through the rotten timbers of the bridge, and was drowned. He had
but this one animal to convey all his property and his family to his new
home.</p></li>
<li><p>His wife and children were almost miraculously [2] saved from
sharing the fate of the horse; but the loss of this poor animal was
enough. By its aid the family, it may be said, had lived and moved; now
they were left helpless in a land of strangers, without the ability [3]
to go on or return, without money or a single friend to whom to appeal.
The case was a hard one.</p></li>
<li><p>There were a great many who “passed by on the other side.” Some
even laughed at the predicament [4] in which the man was placed; but by
degrees a group of people began to collect, all of whom pitied
him.</p></li>
<li><p>Some pitied him a great deal, and some did not pity him very
much, because, they said, he might have known better than to try to
cross an unsafe bridge, and should have made his horse swim the river.
Pity, however, seemed rather to predominate [5] . Some pitied the man,
and some the horse; all pitied the poor, sick mother and her six
helpless children.</p></li>
<li><p>Among this pitying party was a rough son of the West, who knew
what it was to migrate some hundreds of miles over new roads to locate
[6] a destitute [7] family on a prairie. Seeing the man’s forlorn
situation, and looking around on the bystanders, he said, “All of you
seem to pity these poor people very much, but I would beg leave to ask
each of you how much.”</p></li>
<li><p>“There, stranger,” continued he, holding up a ten-dollar bill,
“there is the amount of my pity; and if others will do as I do, you may
soon get another pony. God bless you.” It is needless to state the
effect that this active charity produced. In a short time the happy
emigrant arrived at his destination [8] , and he is now a thriving [9]
farmer, and a neighbor to him who was his “friend in need, and a friend
indeed.”</p></li>

<li><p>从前，一个穷人带着全家老小从美国缅因州卡斯廷镇迁往伊利诺伊州。当他们途经纽约州，正打算从桥上穿过一条河流时，他家里的马撞断桥上腐朽的栏杆，不幸掉进河里淹死了——这匹马是他用来承载所有家产和家人的唯一运输工具。</p></li>
<li><p>这个穷人的妻小近乎奇迹般地从失去马匹的绝望深渊中恢复过来了，但这匹可怜动物的死给他们造成了巨大损失。或许可以这么说，无论居住或者搬迁，马对这个处于迁徙状态中的家庭来说，毕竟举足轻重。如今，他们身处一片举目无亲、孤立无援的土地上求告无门，进退两难，缺少盘缠但无人可以求助，他们的处境的确非常糟糕。</p></li>
<li><p>那时，还有大批移民逆向涌来。有些人对这个家庭所处的困境幸灾乐祸，但渐渐的，另一些人，那些同情他们处境的人，开始聚集起来。</p></li>
<li><p>在这些人当中，有些人对他们的困境感同身受，也有些人虽然同情他们，却觉得男主人应该事先考虑到这些，不该试图从这座摇摇欲坠的桥上穿过，而应该让那匹马从河上游过去。然而，同情的情绪在人群中蔓延开来。有些人同情这个穷人，有些人为那匹马叹息，而那位穷苦病弱的母亲和她六个无助的孩子让所有人都心生怜悯。</p></li>
<li><p>人群中有一个从西部来的男人，性格相当直率。他清楚从数百英里以外的地方迁徙而来，并试图在大草原上找到栖身地，对一个贫困家庭而言，有多困难。目睹这个穷人的窘迫，他环视着周围的旁观者，说道：“大家看起来都很同情这个可怜的家庭。请原谅我冒昧地问一句：你们有多同情他们？”</p></li>
<li><p>“请看这里，我们原本素昧平生，”他拿出一张十美元的钞票，“这是我对他们的同情。如果有人愿意像我一样，我马上送你一匹小马驹，愿上帝保佑你！”不用说，当时募捐场面相当火爆。因为不久以后，这个新迁来的家庭迅速定居下来，男主人很快成为一个家业蒸蒸日上的农民，而他也收获了一个“患难中见真情”的邻居，那个在他艰难时帮他伸手募捐的朋友。</p></li>

<p>Oliver Goldsmith (b. 1728, d. 1774) was born at Pallas, or
Pallasmore, in the parish of Forney, Ireland. He received his education
at several schools, at Trinity College, Dublin, at Edinburgh, and at
Leyden. He spent some time in wandering over continental Europe, often
in poverty and want. In 1756 he became a resident of London, where he
made the acquaintance of several celebrated men, among whom were
Dr. Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. His writings are noted for their
purity, grace, and fluency. His fame as a poet is secured by “The
Traveler,” and “The Deserted Village;” as a dramatist, by “She Stoops to
Conquer;” and as a novelist, by “The Vicar of Wakefield.” His reckless
extravagance always kept him in financial difficulty, and he died
heavily in debt. His monument is in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-23-3">LESSON 23</h2>
<p>KING CHARLES II. AND WILLIAM PENN</p>
<p>英王查尔斯二世与威廉·佩恩先生</p>
<p>King Charles . Well, friend William! I have sold you a noble province
in North America; but still, I suppose you have no thoughts of going
thither yourself?</p>
<p>Penn . Yes, I have, I assure thee, friend Charles; and I am just come
to bid thee farewell.</p>
<p>K . C . What! venture yourself among the savages of North America!
Why, man, what security have you that you will not be in their war
kettle in two hours after setting foot on their shores?</p>
<p>P . The best security in the world.</p>
<p>K . C . I doubt that, friend William; I have no idea of any security
against those cannibals [1] but in a regiment [2] of good soldiers, with
their muskets and bayonets. And mind, I tell you beforehand, that, with
all my good will for you and your family, to whom I am under
obligations, I will not send a single soldier with you.</p>
<p>P . I want none of thy soldiers, Charles: I depend on something
better than thy soldiers.</p>
<p>K . C . Ah! what may that be?</p>
<p>P . Why, I depend upon themselves; on the working of their own
hearts; on their notions of justice; on their moral sense.</p>
<p>K . C . A fine thing, this same moral sense, no doubt; but I fear you
will not find much of it among the Indians of North America.</p>
<p>P . And why not among them as well as others?</p>
<p>K . C . Because if they had possessed any, they would not have
treated my subjects so barbarously as they have done.</p>
<p>P . That is no proof of the contrary, friend Charles. Thy subjects
were the aggressors [3] . When thy subjects first went to North America,
they found these poor people the fondest and kindest creatures in the
world. Every day they would watch for them to come ashore, and hasten to
meet them, and feast them on the best fish, and venison [4] , and corn,
which were all they had. In return for this hospitality of the savages,
as we call them, thy subjects, termed Christians, seized on their
country and rich hunting grounds for farms for themselves. Now, is it to
be wondered at, that these much-injured people should have been driven
to desperation by such injustice; and that, burning with revenge, they
should have committed some excesses [5] ?</p>
<p>K . C . Well, then, I hope you will not complain when they come to
treat you in the same manner.</p>
<p>P . I am not afraid of it.</p>
<p>K . C . Ah! how will you avoid it? You mean to get their hunting
grounds, too, I suppose?</p>
<p>P . Yes, but not by driving these poor people away from them.</p>
<p>K . C . No, indeed? How then will you get their lands?</p>
<p>P . I mean to buy their lands of them.</p>
<p>K . C . Buy their lands of them? Why, man, you have already bought
them of me!</p>
<p>P . Yes, I know I have, and at a dear rate, too; but I did it only to
get thy good will, not that I thought thou hadst any right to their
lands.</p>
<p>K . C . How, man? no right to their lands?</p>
<p>P . No, friend Charles, no right; no right at all: what right hast
thou to their lands?</p>
<p>K . C . Why, the right of discovery, to be sure; the right which the
Pope and all Christian kings have agreed to give one another.</p>
<p>P . The right of discovery? A strange kind of right, indeed. Now
suppose, friend Charles, that some canoe load of these Indians, crossing
the sea, and discovering this island of Great Britain, were to claim it
as their own, and set it up for sale over thy head, what wouldst thou
think of it?</p>
<p>K . C . Why—why—why—I must confess, I should think it a piece of
great impudence in them.</p>
<p>P . Well, then, how canst thou, a Christian, and a Christian prince,
too, do that which thou so utterly condemnest [6] in these people whom
thou callest savages? And suppose, again, that these Indians, on thy
refusal to give up thy island of Great Britain, were to make war on
thee, and, having weapons more destructive than thine, were to destroy
many of thy subjects, and drive the rest away—wouldst thou not think it
horribly cruel?</p>
<p>K . C . I must say, friend William, that I should; how can I say
otherwise?</p>
<p>P . Well, then, how can I, who call myself a Christian, do what I
should abhor even in the heathen? No. I will not do it. But I will buy
the right of the proper owners, even of the Indians themselves. By doing
this, I shall imitate God himself in his justice and mercy, and thereby
insure his blessing on my colony, if I should ever live to plant one in
North America.</p>
<p>(Mason L. Weems)</p>
<p>NOTES.—Charles II. was king of England from A.D. 1660 to 1685.
William Penn (b. 1644, d. 1718) was a noted Englishman who belonged to
the sect of Friends. He came to America in 1682, and founded the
province which is now the state of Pennsylvania. He purchased the lands
from the Indians, who were so impressed with the justice and good will
of Penn and his associates, that the Quaker dress often served as a sure
protection when other settlers were trembling for their lives.</p>

<p>查尔斯二世：好了，我的老朋友威廉！我已经将北美大陆一大片不错的土地售给你，但看起来，你似乎根本不想到那儿去？</p>
<p>佩恩：不，我亲爱的查尔斯陛下，我是要去的。事实上，我就是来向您道别的。</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：天哪！你真要到北美那群野蛮人堆里冒险？我敢保证，一旦你踏上北美海滩，不出两小时，那群野蛮人就会刀斧鸣鼓地向你发动进攻，你如何保住自家性命？</p>
<p>佩恩：用世界上最安全的保护措施。</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：威廉，我的朋友，我很怀疑这点。面对那些食人族，除了带上一批全副武装的英勇士兵，我想象不出还有其他更好的防卫手段。听着，我可事先奉告你：我绝对不会派一兵一卒跟着你的，虽然我对你和你的家庭负有责任，也诚恳地愿你们一切平安。</p>
<p>佩恩：我不需要您任何兵卒，查尔斯陛下。我将依靠比您的士兵更好的东西。</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：啊！是什么？</p>
<p>佩恩：我将依靠那些印第安人，依靠他们的良知，依靠他们的正义感，依靠他们的道德观。</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：道德观，这听起来无疑很美妙，可我担心在北美印第安人部落里，你或许难以找到什么道德观。</p>
<p>佩恩：如果我能在其他人身上找到，为什么在他们身上找不到呢？</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：如果他们拥有哪怕一丝道德，他们就不会那么野蛮地对待我的臣民，像他们此前所做的那样。</p>
<p>佩恩：查尔斯陛下，我的朋友，对此我们并没有证据，您的臣民是侵略者。当您的臣民们第一次踏上北美大陆，他们发现，世界上没有人能比那些可怜的土著更温顺平和，待人友好了。每天，那些印第安人毫无例外地赶到海滩探望白人，给他们送上最好的鱼肉、鹿肉、玉米，倾其所有，供其充饥。为回报土著人的热情好客，您的臣民，虔诚的基督徒们，将他们称为“野蛮人”，强占掠夺印第安人大片家园以及丰美的狩猎场，建起自己的农场。现在，这些饱受蹂躏的人民被逼到绝境，愤怒报复，并因此做出许多过激的事。对他们的行为，难道我们真的需要惊诧吗？</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：好了，当他们用同样的方式来对待你的时候，但愿你不要抱怨。</p>
<p>佩恩：对此我并不害怕。</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：嘿！可你怎么避免他们报复呢？你也想得到他们的狩猎场，不是吗？</p>
<p>佩恩：是的，我需要土地，但我并不想将这些可怜的人从他们的土地上驱逐出去。</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：不驱逐他们？那你想如何得到他们的土地？</p>
<p>佩恩：我打算从他们手中购买土地。</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：从他们手中购买土地？你疯了吗，你已经从我手上买下了这片土地！</p>
<p>佩恩：是的，我确实这么做了，而且价格还不便宜。但我之所以这样做，只是为了得到您的许可和祝福，当然，我并不认为，您对印第安人的土地享有任何权力。</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：伙计，你说什么？难道我没有支配印第安人土地的权力？</p>
<p>佩恩：没有，查尔斯陛下，没有权力，一点权力都没有，您觉得您对他们的土地享有什么权力呢？</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：这不是很明显的事嘛，土地的最先发现权，这是教皇与所有基督教国王无一不赞同相互之间给予的权力。</p>
<p>佩恩：土地的最先发现权？真是莫名其妙。查尔斯陛下，我的朋友，不妨推想一下，如果这些印第安人乘着他们的独木舟漂洋过海，最终发现了大不列颠群岛，然后声称这岛屿属于他们，并在您眼皮底下将其标价出售，您会怎么想？</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：这，这，这——我得承认，这实在太厚颜无耻了！</p>
<p>佩恩：是的。那么，您，一位虔诚的基督徒，一位尊贵的基督徒国王，又怎么能做出与您所谴责的这群野蛮人同样的事情？请再假设一下，倘若这些印第安人拒绝放弃您的大不列颠岛，甚至对您进行宣战，他们手中的武器更具破坏力，大规模屠戮您的臣民，并驱逐剩下的人——您是否觉得这残酷得令人无法想象？</p>
<p>查尔斯二世：我必须同意，威廉，我的朋友，我竟说不出反对的话来。</p>
<p>佩恩：那么，我，一个自称是基督徒的人，又怎么能去做那些我最憎恶的事，哪怕是针对那些异教徒？不，我不会那么做。我会从合法的拥有者手上购买权利，即使这些拥有者就是印第安人。我这样做，是为了效仿上帝的公义和仁慈，从而确保上帝佑福降临我管辖的领地，如果我真想在北美拥有领地的话。</p>

<li><p>It was Saturday night, and the widow of the Pine Cottage sat by
her blazing fagots [1] , with her five tattered children at her side,
endeavoring by listening to the artlessness of their prattle [2] to
dissipate [3] the heavy gloom that pressed upon her mind. For a year,
her own feeble hand had provided for her helpless family, for she had no
supporter: she thought of no friend in all the wide, unfriendly world
around.</p></li>
<li><p>But that mysterious Providence, the wisdom of whose ways is above
human comprehension, had visited her with wasting sickness, and her
little means had become exhausted. It was now, too, midwinter, and the
snow lay heavy and deep through all the surrounding forests, while
storms still seemed gathering in the heavens, and the driving wind
roared amid the neighboring pines, and rocked her puny [4]
mansion.</p></li>
<li><p>The last herring smoked upon the coals before her; it was the
only article of food she possessed, and no wonder her forlorn, desolate
state brought up in her lone bosom all the anxieties of a mother when
she looked upon her children: and no wonder, forlorn as she was, if she
suffered the heart swellings of despair to rise, even though she knew
that He, whose promise is to the widow and to the orphan, can not forget
his word.</p></li>
<li><p>Providence had many years before taken from her her eldest son,
who went from his forest home to try his fortune on the high seas, since
which she had heard no tidings of him; and in her latter time had, by
the hand of death, deprived her of the companion and staff of her
earthly pilgrimage [5] , in the person of her husband. Yet to this hour
she had upborne; she had not only been able to provide for her little
flock, but had never lost an opportunity of ministering to the wants of
the miserable and destitute.</p></li>
<li><p>The indolent may well bear with poverty while the ability to gain
sustenance [6] remains. The individual who has but his own wants to
supply may suffer with fortitude [7] the winter of want; his affections
are not wounded, his heart is not wrung. The most desolate in populous
cities may hope, for charity has not quite closed her hand and heart,
and shut her eyes on misery.</p></li>
<li><p>But the industrious mother of helpless and depending children,
far from the reach of human charity, has none of these to console her.
And such a one was the widow of the Pine Cottage; but as she bent over
the fire, and took up the last scanty remnant of food to spread before
her children, her spirits seemed to brighten up, as by some sudden and
mysterious impulse, and Cowper’s beautiful lines came uncalled across
her mind:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Judge not the Lord by feeble sense.</p>
<p>But trust him for his grace;</p>
<p>Behind a frowning Providence</p>
<p>He hides a smiling face.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>The smoked herring was scarcely laid upon the table, when a
gentle rap at the door, and the loud barking of a dog, attracted the
attention of the family. The children flew to open it, and a weary
traveler, in tattered garments and in apparently indifferent [8] health;
entered, and begged a lodging and a mouthful of food. Said he: “It is
now twenty-four hours since I tasted bread.” The widow’s heart bled
anew, as under a fresh complication [9] of distresses; for her
sympathies [10] lingered not around her fireside. She hesitated not even
now; rest, and a share of all she had, she proffered [11] to the
stranger. “We shall not be forsaken,” said she, “or suffer deeper for an
act of charity.”</p></li>
<li><p>The traveler drew near the board, but when he saw the scanty
fare, he raised his eyes toward heaven with astonishment: “And is this
all your store?” said he; “and a share of this do you offer to one you
know not? then never saw I charity before! But, madam,” said he,
continuing, “do you not wrong your children by giving a part of your
last mouthful to a stranger?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Ah,” said the poor widow—and the tear-drops gushed into her eyes
as she said it—“I have a boy, a darling son, somewhere on the face of
the wide world, unless Heaven has taken him away, and I only act toward
you as I would that others should act toward him. God, who sent manna
[12] from heaven, can provide for us as he did for Israel; and how
should I this night offend him, if my son should be a wanderer,
destitute as you, and he should have provided for him a home, even poor
as this, were I to turn you unrelieved away!”</p></li>
<li><p>The widow ended, and the stranger, springing from his seat,
clasped her in his arms. “God indeed has provided your son a home, and
has given him wealth to reward the goodness of his benefactress: my
mother! oh, my mother!” It was her long lost son, returned to her bosom
from the Indies. He had chosen that disguise that he might the more
completely surprise his family; and never was surprise more perfect, or
followed by a sweeter cup of joy.</p></li>

<li><p>一个周六的夜晚，松木小屋里的寡妇坐在燃烧着的柴薪旁边，五个衣衫褴褛的孩子在她身边叽叽喳喳地咿呀嬉闹着。她听着他们不谙人世的纯真话语，心中那沉重的阴霾似乎消散了一些。这一年来，她用羸弱的双手独自支撑起这个贫苦无靠的家庭，求告无门。在这个偌大寒冷的世界上，她举目无亲，无所可依。</p></li>
<li><p>但是，世事难料，上帝的智慧不是人类所能理解的：她染上了慢性疾病，微薄的家产也逐渐消耗殆尽。现在正值隆冬，四周森林莽野，积雪深厚，暴风雪仍在天空中不断聚集，随时可能袭来，料峭的寒风在松树林间呼啸而过，不断摇撼着她弱小的棚屋。</p></li>
<li><p>最后一条熏鲱鱼在她面前的炭火上燎起轻烟，这是她仅剩的最后一点食物。面对着这点食物，看着身旁天真烂漫的孩子们，她孤独的心里充满了焦虑，那是身为母亲的无助。毋庸多说，她倍感孤独，尽管她知道，上帝曾向贫困中的孤儿寡母许下允诺，绝不会违背他的诺言，她还是感到最后的绝望仍在心中蔓延开来。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>4.很多年前，上帝曾将她的长子从她身边带走。他走出这个林间小屋，去大海上闯荡。从那以后，她再也没听到他的音讯。后来，死神最终夺去了他的丈夫——她生命旅程中的伴侣以及家庭支柱。即便那时，她仍怀有支撑下去的信念。她不但独自养活家里嗷嗷待哺的孩子们，对于那些处境更穷困潦倒的人们，她也总是伸出援手。</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>懒惰者即使拥有维持生计的能力，仍然会一直保持贫穷。那些自身匮乏却始终给予奉献的人，虽然也要饱经尘世苦难，但他始终拥有爱人的能力，他的心从不曾被扭曲。在人口稠密的喧嚣城市，那里的穷人也许心怀希望，因为慈善的人会向他们敞开心灵，伸出援手，那些善良的人不会对悲惨境况视若无睹。</p></li>
<li><p>然而，这个勤劳无助而依赖孩子的母亲，远离人间行善，亦未曾接受任何仁慈，以慰藉她那颗饱经沧桑的心。但是，这位松木小屋里的寡母，当她弯腰从火堆上拿起这条最后仅存的熏鲱鱼，分给身旁的孩子们，她的心情似乎开朗了些许，仿佛受到某种突如其来的神秘感召，考珀优美的诗句蓦然在她心头想起：</p></li>
</ol>
<p>别用你的无知来论断神。</p>
<p>相信他会为你带来恩典。</p>
<p>在每个困窘的处境背后，</p>
<p>都隐藏着上帝的笑脸。</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>烤好的熏鲱鱼被一点一点地分到盘子里，放在桌上。这时，门上响起轻轻的叩门声，狗吠也随之响起，吸引了全家人的目光。孩子们飞奔过去打开门，一个疲惫的旅行者走进来。他衣衫褴褛，看起来倒还健康。他请求在这里住上一晚，并给他点吃的东西。他说：“我已经一天一夜没吃过东西了。”寡母的心又再度揪痛起来，新的困厄到来更是雪上加霜；毕竟，她的同情心绝不会让她无动于衷地坐在火堆旁。她毫不犹豫地请他住下，并向陌生人递上了自己的那份熏鲱鱼。“我们不会因为做了善事，”她说，“而被上帝抛弃，或承受更深的痛苦。”</p></li>

<li><p>“啊，”这个可怜的寡妇说着，泪如泉涌，“我有个儿子，他是我心爱的孩子，他活在这广阔世界上的某个地方，除非天父将他带走。我为你做这些事，就是指望别人也能这样善待他。我的上帝，会从天上为我们降下救恩，正如他曾为以色列人所做的那样。如果我的儿子也正在流浪，像你一样穷困潦倒，我多么希望上帝也为他提供一个落脚处，哪怕像我们这间小屋一样简陋。如果我拒绝落难中的你，我又怎能指望别人为他做点什么！”</p></li>
<li><p>寡妇刚说完，那个陌生人“腾”地从椅子上跳起来，将她紧紧抱住，“上帝确实为你的儿子提供了住处，并赐予他财富，来回报收留他的这位善良女主人：妈妈！噢，我的妈妈！”原来，这便是她失散多年的儿子，从印度群岛回到她的怀抱。他装扮成过路人，为的是给全家人一个惊喜。再没有比这更大的惊喜了，随后，这个小木屋顿时变成一片欢乐的海洋。</p></li>

<p>James Henry Leigh Hunt (b. 1784, d. 1859) was the son of a West
Indian, who married an American lady, and practiced law in Philadelphia
until the Revolution; being a Tory, he then returned to England, where
Leigh Hunt was born. The latter wrote many verses while yet a boy, and
in 1801 his father published a collection of them, entitled “Juvenilia.”
For many years he was connected with various newspapers, and, while
editor of the “Examiner,” was imprisoned for two years for writing
disrespectfully of the prince regent. While in prison he was visited
frequently by the poets Byron, Moore, Lamb, Shelley, and Keats; and
there wrote “The Feast of the Poets,” “The Descent of Liberty, a Mask,”
and “The Story of Rimini,” which immediately gave him a reputation as a
poet. His writings include various translations, dramas, novels,
collections of essays, and poems.</p>

<p>John Wilson (b. 1785, d. 1854), better known as “Christopher North,”
was a celebrated author, poet, and critic, born at Paisley, Scotland,
and educated at the University of Glasgow and at Oxford. In 1808 he
moved to Westmoreland, England, where he formed one of the “Lake School”
of poets. While at Oxford he gained a prize for a poem on “Painting,
Poetry, and Architecture.” In 1820 he became Professor of Moral
Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, which position he retained
until 1851. He gained his greatest reputation as the chief author of
“Noctes Ambrosianae,” essays contributed to Blackwood’s Magazine between
1822 and 1835. Among his poems may be mentioned “The Isle of Palms” and
the “City of the Plague,” This selection is adapted from “The
Foresters,” a tale of Scottish life.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lucy was only six years old, but bold as a fairy; she had gone by
herself a thousand times about the braes [2] , and often upon errands to
houses two or three miles distant. What had her parents to fear? The
footpaths were all firm, and led to no places of danger, nor are infants
themselves incautious when alone in then pastimes [3] . Lucy went
singing into the low woods, and singing she reappeared on the open
hillside. With her small white hand on the rail, she glided along the
wooden bridge, or tripped from stone to stone across the shallow
streamlet.</p></li>
<li><p>The creature would be away for hours, and no fear be felt on her
account by anyone at home; whether she had gone, with her basket on her
arm, to borrow some articles of household use from a neighbor, or,
merely for her own solitary delight, had wandered off to the braes to
play among the flowers, coming back laden with wreaths and
garlands.</p></li>
<li><p>The happy child had been invited to pass a whole day, from
morning to night, at Ladyside (a farmhouse about two miles off) with her
playmates the Maynes; and she left home about an hour after
sunrise.</p></li>
<li><p>During her absence, the house was silent but happy, and, the
evening being now far advanced, Lucy was expected home every minute, and
Michael, Agnes, and Isabel, her father, mother, and aunt, went to meet
her on the way. They walked on and on, wondering a little, but in no
degree alarmed till they reached Ladyside, and heard the cheerful din of
the children within, still rioting [4] at the close of the holiday.
Jacob Mayne came to the door, but, on their kindly asking why Lucy had
not been sent home before daylight was over, he looked painfully
surprised, and said that she had not been at Ladyside.</p></li>
<li><p>Within two hours, a hundred persons were traversing the hills in
all directions, even at a distance which it seemed most unlikely that
poor Lucy could have reached. The shepherds and their dogs, all the
night through, searched every nook, every stony and rocky place, every
piece of taller heather [5] , every crevice that could conceal anything
alive or dead: but no Lucy was there.</p></li>
<li><p>Her mother, who for a while seemed inspired [6] with supernatural
[7] strength, had joined in the search, and with a quaking heart looked
into every brake [8] , or stopped and listened to every shout and halloo
reverberating [9] among the hills, intent [10] to seize upon some tone
of recognition or discovery. But the moon sank; and then the stars,
whose increased brightness had for a short time supplied her place, all
faded away; and then came the gray dawn of the morning, and then the
clear brightness of the day,—and still Michael and Agnes were
childless.</p></li>
<li><p>“She has sunk into some mossy or miry place,” said Michael, to a
man near him, into whose face he could not look, “a cruel, cruel death
to one like her! The earth on which my child walked has closed over her,
and we shall never see her more!”</p></li>
<li><p>At last, a man who had left the search, and gone in a direction
toward the highroad, came running with something in his arms toward the
place where Michael and others were standing beside Agnes, who lay,
apparently exhausted almost to dying, on the sward. He approached
hesitatingly; and Michael saw that he carried Lucy’s bonnet, clothes,
and plaid [11] .</p></li>
<li><p>It was impossible not to see some spots of blood upon the frill
that the child had worn around her neck. “Murdered! murdered!” was the
one word whispered or ejaculated [12] all around; but Agnes heard it
not; for, worn out by that long night of hope and despair, she had
fallen asleep, and was, perhaps, seeking her lost Lucy in her
dreams.</p></li>
<li><p>Isabel took the clothes, and, narrowly inspecting them with eye
and hand, said, with a fervent voice that was heard even in Michael’s
despair, “No, Lucy is yet among the living. There are no marks of
violence on the garments of the innocent; no murderer’s hand has been
here. These blood spots have been put there to deceive. Besides, would
not the murderer have carried off these things? For what else would he
have murdered her? But, oh! foolish despair! What speak I of? For,
wicked as the world is—ay! desperately wicked—there is not, on all the
surface of the wide earth, a hand that would murder our child! Is it not
plain as the sun in the heaven, that Lucy has been stolen by some
wretched gypsy beggar?”</p></li>
<li><p>The crowd quietly dispersed, and horse and foot began to scour
[13] the country. Some took the highroads, others all the bypaths, and
many the trackless hills. Now that they were in some measure relieved
from the horrible belief that the child was dead, the worst other
calamity seemed nothing, for hope brought her back to their
arms.</p></li>
<li><p>Agnes had been able to walk home to Bracken-Braes, and Michael
and Isabel sat by her bedside. All her strength was gone, and she lay at
the mercy of the rustle of a leaf, or a shadow across the window. Thus
hour after hour passed, till it was again twilight. “I hear footsteps
coming up the brae,” said Agnes, who had for some time appeared to be
slumbering; and in a few moments the voice of Jacob Mayne was heard at
the outer door.</p></li>
<li><p>Jacob wore a solemn expression of countenance, and he seemed,
from his looks, to bring no comfort. Michael stood up between him and
his wife, and looked into his heart. Something there seemed to be in his
face that was not miserable. “If he has heard nothing of my child,”
thought Michael, “this man must care little for his own fireside.” “Oh,
speak, speak,” said Agnes; “yet why need you speak? All this has been
but a vain belief, and Lucy is in heaven.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Something like a trace of her has been discovered; a woman, with
a child that did not look like a child of hers, was last night at
Clovenford, and left it at the dawning.” “Do you hear that, my beloved
Agnes?” said Isabel; “she will have tramped away with Lucy up into
Ettrick or Yarrow; but hundreds of eyes will have been upon her; for
these are quiet but not solitary glens; and the hunt will be over long
before she has crossed down upon Hawick. I knew that country in my young
days. What say you, Mr. Mayne? There is the light of hope in your face.”
“There is no reason to doubt, ma’am, that it was Lucy. Everybody is sure
of it. If it was my own Rachel, I should have no fear as to seeing her
this blessed night.”</p></li>
<li><p>Jacob Mayne now took a chair, and sat down, with even a smile
upon his countenance. “I may tell you now, that Watty Oliver knows it
was your child, for he saw her limping along after the gypsy at
Galla-Brigg; but, having no suspicion, he did not take a second look at
her,—but one look is sufficient, and he swears it was bonny Lucy
Forester.”</p></li>
<li><p>Aunt Isabel, by this time, had bread and cheese and a bottle of
her own elder-flower wine on the table. “You have been a long and hard
journey, wherever you have been, Mr. Mayne; take some refreshment;” and
Michael asked a blessing.</p></li>
<li><p>Jacob saw that he might now venture to reveal the whole truth.
“No, no, Mrs. Irving, I am over happy to eat or to drink. You are all
prepared for the blessing that awaits you. Your child is not far off;
and I myself, for it is I myself that found her, will bring her by the
hand, and restore her to her parents.”</p></li>
<li><p>Agnes had raised herself up in her bed at these words, but she
sank gently back on her pillow; aunt Isabel was rooted to her chair; and
Michael, as he rose up, felt as if the ground were sinking under his
feet. There was a dead silence all around the house for a short space,
and then the sound of many voices, which again by degrees subsided. The
eyes of all then looked, and yet feared to look, toward the
door.</p></li>
<li><p>Jacob Mayne was not so good as his word, for he did not bring
Lucy by the hand to restore her to her parents; but dressed again in her
own bonnet and gown, and her own plaid, in rushed their own child, by
herself, with tears and sobs of joy, and her father laid her within her
mother’s bosom.</p></li>

<p>约翰·威尔逊（1785—1854），著名作家、诗人兼评论家，他的笔名克里斯托夫·诺斯更为人所熟知。威尔逊出生于苏格兰佩斯里镇，曾在格拉斯洛大学和牛津大学接受教育。
1808年，他移居到英国威斯特摩兰，并在那里建立“英国湖畔诗”流派分系。在牛津大学求学期间，他的诗歌《绘画，诗歌和建筑》荣膺奖项。
1820年，他在爱丁堡大学担任伦理学教授，并一直任职到1851年。作为《安部罗斯那对话》的首席作者，
1822年和1835年间，该书在《黑檀木》杂志上连载，他因此声名鹊起。在他的诗歌中，《棕榈岛》和《瘟疫之城》尤为值得一提。以下这篇文章改编自他的《弗斯特一家》，一篇描写苏格兰生活的故事。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>露西只有六岁，但大胆得像童话里的仙女。她已经独自一人攀爬过不计其数的陡坡，还经常被差遣到离家两三英里远的地方帮忙办事。她的父母有什么可担心的呢？附近的小路都很坚实，并不通往什么危险的地方，这些孩子们一个人的时候也都很谨慎小心。露西总是唱着歌，钻进低矮的树林里，她重复吟唱的稚嫩歌声也常在开阔的山坡上飘荡回响。她用白嫩的小手扶着栏杆，时而飞快地跑过木桥，时而踩着石头，跳过清浅的小溪。</p></li>
<li><p>这个小家伙总会一连好几个钟头不沾家，家里从没人曾为她担心过——不管她是在胳膊上挎只小花篮，去邻居那儿借点儿家什物件；还是仅为了让自己玩得开心，而跑到附近斜坡的花丛间昏天黑地地玩，然后将一堆花环拎回家。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>3.这个快乐的小姑娘总会被邀请去淑女坡（大约两英里外的一处农庄），和她的小玩伴梅恩一家的孩子们度过一整天。通常，日出一小时后，她便从家里出发。</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>她不在家的时候，家里显得寂寞安宁。现在，天早就黑了，家里人惦记着她早点回家。于是，露西的父亲迈克尔、母亲艾格尼丝和婶婶伊莎贝尔都去路上接她。他们走着，走着，好奇为什么没遇上她，但心里没有一点惊慌，直到他们不知不觉间走到淑女坡。节日已经快结束了，但屋里孩子们仍在尽情嬉闹着。雅各·梅恩开了门，来客礼貌地询问他，为什么露西没在天黑以前被送回家。听到这话，雅各神色惊愕地告诉他们，露西今天根本就没来淑女坡。</p></li>
<li><p>接下来的两小时里，一百多人搜索了山里的各个角落，甚至连可怜的小露西根本不可能走到的地方也都去了。整整一夜，那些牧羊人带着他们的牧羊犬，找遍了山间野外的旮旯角落，甚至每处石缝沟壑、灌木树林，那些可以藏身匿尸的所有地方，但是，哪儿都找不到小露西。</p></li>
<li><p>似乎被某种超自然的力量支撑着，露西的母亲也加入了夜间搜索。她心惊胆战地查看途经的茂密丛林，时而停下脚步，倾听着从山谷那边回荡过来的大家的呼喊声，试图从里面聆听到是否有好消息。月亮沉落了，星星看起来更亮了些，多少照亮了她的路；但是很快，星星也随之黯淡了。清晨煦光乍露，接着，一轮艳阳腾空而起，清晰地照亮了大地——可是，迈克尔和艾格尼丝仍然没有孩子的消息。</p></li>
<li><p>“露西大概是陷进长满青苔或泥泞的地方了，”迈克尔对身边的一个男人说，他没法直视那男人的脸，“对她这样的孩子来说，这是个多么、多么残忍的死法！我的孩子曾走过的这片土地吞噬了她，我们再也见不到她了！”</p></li>
<li><p>搜索队早有人离开，独自朝公路方向走去寻找，后来，有人向他们跑来，手里拿着些什么东西。迈克尔和其他人站在艾格尼丝身边，艾格尼丝躺在草地上，明显已经精疲力竭，一副濒死的模样。来人踌躇不决地靠近了，迈克尔一眼看到，他手里拿的正是露西的帽子、衣服和外套。</p></li>
<li><p>所有人都看到，孩子的衣服脖颈处，有几点明显的血迹。“孩子被谋杀了！被谋杀了！”有些人窃窃私语着，有些人高声惊呼着，但说的都是同样的一句话。但是，母亲艾格尼丝听不见了，整整一夜希望与绝望的反复折腾后，她早已疲惫不堪地睡着了，或许正在梦里寻找她丢失的可爱露西。</p></li>
<li><p>婶婶伊莎贝尔接过衣服，仔仔细细地检查了一番，急切地说：“不，露西还活着。”她的声音给绝望的迈克尔带来希望，“孩子的衣服上没有丝毫施暴的痕迹，凶手的手从未碰到过这些衣服。这些血迹是后来沾上去的，大概是为了隐藏些什么。更何况，如果真的有人谋杀了露西，为什么他不把这些衣服带走？他又为什么要谋杀她呢？哦，没有必要这么绝望！我想说些什么？我想说的是，这世道虽然邪恶——是啊，令人绝望的邪恶！但是，这世上并没有人杀死了我们的孩子！事实再清楚不过了，露西是被某个卑鄙无耻的吉普赛乞丐给偷走了！”</p></li>
<li><p>人群安静地散开，马蹄或脚印很快将布满周边地区。有些人沿着大路搜索，有些人去岔道追踪，还有些人到那些偏僻的山岭里寻找。现在，他们多少从那个孩子已不在世上的可怕念头中解脱出来，更坏的灾祸看来绝不可能，生的希望已将露西重新带回众人怀里。</p></li>
<li><p>艾格尼丝已经从布雷垦山坡走回家里，迈克尔和伊莎贝尔坐在她的床边。她看来完全筋疲力尽了，静静躺在那里，窗外，树叶沙沙作响，荫影越过窗棂，周围仿佛沉浸在一片悲戚之中。时间一点点流逝，直到满天星斗再现。“我听到斜坡上有脚步声。”艾格尼丝突然说，她原本看上去已经睡着了。不一会儿，雅各·梅恩的声音在门外响起。</p></li>
<li><p>雅各·梅恩脸色凝重，从他表情看来，他带来的大概不是什么好消息。迈克尔在来客与妻子间站起来，深深地看着雅各，似乎要洞察他的灵魂。雅各脸上的表情看起来并不是那么糟糕。“如果他没有露西的消息，”迈克尔心想，“这男人这会儿多半会在自家的壁炉边。”“哦，你快说呀，说呀，”艾格尼丝焦急地说，“但你还需要说什么呢？所有这一切不过是虚妄之想，露西已经去了天国了。”</p></li>
<li><p>“有人发现了关于露西的线索：昨天夜里在克娄文福德，有个女人带着一个孩子，那孩子看起来并不像她亲生的，她们今早刚离开。”“亲爱的艾格尼丝，你听到了吗？”伊莎贝尔说。“那女人多半会带着露西向北逃往埃特里克或亚罗，但是，好几百双眼睛都会盯着她的。这些山谷虽然人烟稀少，但总会有人蹲守，甚至没等到她赶到霍维克，我们就会抓到她。我打小就对这片地区相当熟悉，你怎么看，梅恩先生？你脸上露出希望的光彩。”“毫无疑问，夫人，那孩子就是露西，没有人不相信。倘若那是我的女儿瑞切尔，我一定立马就想见到她，就在这个上帝赐福的夜晚。”</p></li>
<li><p>雅各·梅恩拉过一把椅子坐下来，脸上甚至浮出一丝笑容。“现在，我可以告诉你们，沃迪·奥利弗知道那是你们的孩子，当时在加拉-布里格，他曾看见露西一瘸一拐地跟在那吉普赛女人身后。但由于压根没怀疑，他只不过看了那孩子一眼——但是，一眼就足够了。他发誓，那孩子就是可爱的露西·弗斯特。”</p></li>
<li><p>这时，伊莎贝尔婶婶将面包、奶酪和一瓶她自酿的接骨木花酒端到餐桌上。“不管你曾到了哪些地方，你一定走了很远的山路，路上那么难走，辛苦你了，梅恩先生，请吃点东西吧。”迈克尔也随声附和。</p></li>
<li><p>雅各心里清楚，说出真相的时候到了。“不，不，欧文夫人，我实在太开心了，什么都吃不下。对于等待已久的圣灵赐福，你们大概都已经做好准备了吧？你们的孩子就在附近，是我亲自找到她的，我要亲手将她带回家，将她重新交回她父母的手中。”</p></li>
<li><p>听到这些话，艾格尼丝飞快地从床上支起身，但又无力地躺到了枕头上；婶婶伊莎贝尔呆坐在椅子上，半晌没回过神来；至于迈克尔，他站起身，觉得天塌地陷。有那么短短几分钟，屋里死一般的寂静，随即爆发出一片欢乐嘈杂，好一会儿才平息下来。所有目光都注视门外，但又惴惴不安，不敢睹视。</p></li>
<li><p>雅各·梅恩并没有兑现他的承诺：他并未亲手将露西送到她父母的手中。露西还是往常一身装扮，戴着帽子，穿着裙子，套着那件带格子图案的外套，一下子冲到家人面前。她的父亲哽咽着，迸出欢喜的泪水，一把抱起她，将她放到母亲的怀里。</p></li>

<p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (b. 1807, d. 1882), the son of
Hon. Stephen Longfellow, an eminent lawyer, was born in Portland, Maine.
He graduated at Bowdoin College in 1825. After spending four years in
Europe, he was Professor of Modern Languages and Literature at Bowdoin
till 1835, when he was appointed to the chair of Modern Languages and
Belles-lettres in Harvard University. He resigned his professorship in
1854, after which time he resided in Cambridge, Mass. Longfellow wrote
many original works both in verse and prose, and made several
translations, the most famous of which is that of the works of Dante.
His poetry is always chaste and elegant, showing traces of careful
scholarship in every line. The numerous and varied editions of his poems
are evidences of their popularity.</p>

<p>THE TOWN PUMP</p>
<p>小镇水泵</p>
<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne (b.1804, d.1864) was born in Salem, Mass. He
graduated at Bowdoin College in 1825. His earliest literary productions,
written for periodicals, were published in two volumes—the first in
1837, the second in 1842—under the title of “Twice-Told Tales,” “Mosses
from an Old Manse,” another series of tales and sketches, was published
in 1845. From 1846 to 1850 he was surveyor of the port of Salem. In 1852
he was appointed United States consul for Liverpool. After holding this
office four years, he traveled for some time on the continent. His most
popular works are “The Scarlet Letter,” a work showing a deep knowledge
of human nature, “The House of the Seven Gables,” “The Blithedale
Romance,” and “The Marble Faun,” an Italian romance, which is regarded
by many as the best of his works. Being of a modest and retiring
disposition, Mr. Hawthorne avoided publicity. Most of his works are
highly imaginative. As a prose writer he has no superior among American
authors. He died at Plymouth, N. H., while on a visit to the White
Mountains for his health.</p>
<p>[SCENE.— The corner of two principal streets. The Town Pump talking
through its nose. ]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Noon, by the north clock! Noon, by the east! High noon, too, by
those hot sunbeams which fall, scarcely aslope, upon my head, and almost
make the water bubble and smoke in the trough under my nose. Truly, we
public characters have a tough time of it! And among all the town
officers, chosen at the yearly meeting, where is he that sustains, for a
single year, the burden of such manifold duties as are imposed, in
perpetuity [1] , upon the Town Pump?</p></li>
<li><p>The title of town treasurer is rightfully mine, as guardian of
the best treasure the town has. The overseers of the poor ought to make
me their chairman, since I provide bountifully for the pauper, without
expense to him that pays taxes. I am at the head of the fire department,
and one of the physicians of the board of health. As a keeper of the
peace, all water drinkers confess me equal to the constable. I perform
some of the duties of the town clerk, by promulgating [2] public
notices, when they are pasted on my front.</p></li>
<li><p>To speak within bounds, I am chief person of the municipality [3]
, and exhibit, moreover, an admirable pattern to my brother officers by
the cool, steady, upright, downright, and impartial discharge of my
business, and the constancy with which I stand to my post. Summer or
winter, nobody seeks me in vain; for all day long I am seen at the
busiest corner, just above the market, stretching out my arms to rich
and poor alike; and at night I hold a lantern over my head, to show
where I am, and to keep people out of the gutters.</p></li>
<li><p>At this sultry noontide, I am cupbearer to the parched populace,
for whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist Like a
dramseller on the public square, on a muster [4] day, I cry aloud to all
and sundry [5] , in my plainest accents, and at the very tiptop of my
voice. “Here it is, gentlemen! Here is the good liquor! Walk up, walk
up, gentlemen, walk up, walk up! Here is the superior stuff! Here is the
unadulterated [6] ale of father Adam! better than Cognac [7] , Hollands,
Jamaica, strong beer, or wine of any price; here it is, by the hogshead
or the single glass, and not a cent to pay. Walk up, gentlemen, walk up
and help yourselves!”</p></li>
<li><p>It were a pity if all this outcry should draw no customers. Here
they come. A hot day, gentlemen. Quaff and away again, so as to keep
yourselves in a nice, cool sweat. You, my friend, will need another
cupful to wash the dust out of your throat, if it be as thick there as
it is on your cowhide shoes. I see that you have trudged half a score of
miles today, and, like a wise man, have passed by the taverns, and
stopped at the running brooks and well curbs. Otherwise, betwixt heat
without and fire within, you would have been burnt to a cinder, or
melted down to nothing at all—in the fashion of a jellyfish.</p></li>
<li><p>Drink, and make room for that other fellow, who seeks my aid to
quench the fiery fever of last night’s potations [8] , which he drained
from no cup of mine. Welcome, most rubicund [9] sir! You and I have been
strangers hitherto; nor, to confess the truth, will my nose be anxious
for a closer intimacy, till the fumes of your breath be a little less
potent.</p></li>
<li><p>Mercy on you, man! The water absolutely hisses down your red-hot
gullet, and is converted quite into steam in the miniature Tophet [10] ,
which you mistake for a stomach. Fill again, and tell me, on the word of
an honest toper, did you ever, in cellar, tavern, or any other kind of
dramshop, spend the price of your children’s food for a swig half so
delicious? Now, for the first time these ten years, you know the flavor
of cold water. Goodby; and whenever you are thirsty, recollect that I
keep a constant supply at the old stand.</p></li>
<li><p>Who next? Oh, my little friend, you are just let loose from
school, and come hither to scrub your blooming face, and drown the
memory of certain taps of the ferule, and other schoolboy troubles, in a
draught from the Town Pump. Take it, pure as the current of your young
life; take it, and may your heart and tongue never be scorched with a
fiercer thirst than now.</p></li>
<li><p>There, my dear child, put down the cup, and yield your place to
this elderly gentleman, who treads so tenderly over the paving stones
that I suspect he is afraid of breaking them. What! he limps by without
so much as thanking me, as if my hospitable offers were meant only for
people who have no wine cellars.</p></li>
<li><p>Well, well, sir, no harm done, I hope! Go, draw the cork, tip the
decanter; but when your great toe shall set you a-roaring, it will be no
affair of mine. If gentlemen love the pleasant titillation [11] of the
gout, it is all one to the Town Pump. This thirsty dog, with his red
tongue lolling out, does not scorn my hospitality, but stands on his
hind legs, and laps eagerly out of the trough. See how lightly he capers
away again! Jowler, did your worship ever have the gout?</p></li>
<li><p>Your pardon, good people! I must interrupt my stream of
eloquence, and spout forth a stream of water to replenish [12] the
trough for this teamster and his two yoke of oxen, who have come all the
way from Staunton, or somewhere along that way. No part of my business
gives me more pleasure than the watering of cattle. Look! how rapidly
they lower the watermark on the sides of the trough, till their
capacious stomachs are moistened with a gallon or two apiece, and they
can afford time to breathe, with sighs of calm enjoyment! Now they roll
their quiet eyes around the brim of their monstrous drinking vessel. An
ox is your true toper.</p></li>
<li><p>I hold myself the grand reformer of the age. From my spout, and
such spouts as mine, must flow the stream that shall cleanse our earth
of a vast portion of its crime and anguish, which have gushed from the
fiery fountains of the still. In this mighty enterprise, the cow shall
be my great confederate. Milk and water!</p></li>
<li><p>Ahem! Dry work this speechifying, especially to all unpracticed
orators. I never conceived till now what toil the temperance lecturers
undergo for my sake. Do, some kind Christian, pump a stroke or two, just
to wet my whistle. Thank you, sir. But to proceed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Town Pump and the Cow! Such is the glorious partnership that
shall finally monopolize [13] the whole business of quenching thirst.
Blessed consummation [14] ! Then Poverty shall pass away from the land,
finding no hovel so wretched where her squalid [15] form may shelter
itself. Then Disease, for lack of other victims, shall gnaw his own
heart and die. Then Sin if she do not die, shall lose half her
strength.</p></li>
<li><p>Then there will be no war of households. The husband and the
wife, drinking deep of peaceful joy, a calm bliss of temperate
affections, shall pass hand in hand through life, and lie down, not
reluctantly, at its protracted [16] close. To them the past will be no
turmoil of mad dreams, nor the future an eternity of such moments as
follow the delirium of a drunkard. Their dead faces shall express what
their spirits were, and are to be, by a lingering smile of memory and
hope.</p></li>
<li><p>Drink, then, and be refreshed! The water is as pure and cold as
when it slaked [17] the thirst of the red hunter, and flowed beneath the
aged bough, though now this gem of the wilderness is treasured under
these hot stones, where no shadow falls, but from the brick buildings.
But, still is this fountain the source of health, peace, and happiness,
and I behold, with certainty and joy, the approach of the period when
the virtues of cold water, too little valued since our father’s days,
will be fully appreciated and recognized by all.</p></li>

<p>纳撒尼尔·霍桑（1804—1864）出生于美国马萨诸塞州塞勒姆。
1825年，他毕业于鲍登学院。他早期为期刊所写的文学作品分两卷结集出版，分别于1837年和1842年问世，题名为《老生常谈的故事》和《老迈牧师的古宅青苔》。
1845年，他又出版了一系列故事和短篇作品集。从1846年到1850年，他担任塞利姆港口的勘测师。
1852年，他被任命为美国政府驻英国利物浦领事，并任职四年。随后，他一度在欧洲大陆游历考察。霍桑最受追捧的《红字》为一部深刻揭示人性的上乘之作，以及《七座尖阁的房屋》、《布里斯戴尔的罗曼史》和《大理石的农神雕像》，后者是一本关于意大利人的爱情小说。大多数人公认《大理石的农神雕像》为他的巅峰之作。由于生性谦虚，不善社交，霍桑先生向来避免抛头露面。他的大部分作品都极富想象力。就散文写作而言，他在美国作家群中并非出类拔萃。霍桑在新罕布什尔州的普利茅斯与世长辞，当时他正因健康问题去怀特山观光游览。</p>
<p>（场景：镇上的两条主干道的交叉口，小镇水泵正通过它的鼻子说话。）</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>北方时钟报时：正午！东方时钟报时：正午！这炙热的阳光近乎垂直地射在我头上，几乎快让我身体里的水沸腾起来，从鼻子里冒出蒸汽。坦率地说，我们这些公众人物的日子可不好过！所有这些每年选举出的小镇官员们，在他们任职的一年中，有谁身上负担的职责能有我小镇水泵承担的这么重呢？我的工作可是永久性的。</p></li>
<li><p>我是当之无愧的小镇财政主管，守护着镇上最珍贵的财产。工会真该提名我做他们的主席，因为我为穷人们慷慨地提供我所守护的财产，分文不取。我是小镇消防部门当仁不让的主管，同时行驶镇上卫生理事会医生的崇高职责。我是安宁生活的守护者，所有饮水居民无不承认我的作用好比治安巡警。有些时候，我还担任小镇书记官的职责，在我身上张贴公告，昭告居民。</p></li>
<li><p>从某种程度上说，我就是这个小镇上最重要的人物，鉴于我的冷静稳定、正直无误以及公正地胜任工作，坚持履行职责，在我的小镇官员同行们面前展示出一个令人钦佩的光辉形象。无论寒冬酷暑，无论什么人求助于我，我一概有求必应。从早到晚，我成天站在这镇上最繁华的角落，就在市场旁边，向人们伸出双手，无论贫富都一视同仁。到了夜晚，我会在头顶高举一盏灯笼，表明我的方位，提醒镇上居民小心沟坎。</p></li>
<li><p>在这个闷热难当的正午，我为这些干渴的人们倒上凉水，腰上别挂个铁质酒杯，尽心为他们服务。就像一个在广场上卖酒的小贩，对那些南来北往的人，我用最大的声音朝他们叫卖：“过来看看吧，先生们！清爽甘甜的饮料！过来吧，过来吧，先生们，都过来看看！这可是上等的饮料，货真价实的天父所赐的最纯正的麦芽饮料！比所有的白兰地、杜松子酒、牙买加甜酒、黄酒或任何葡萄酒都更美味。过来看看吧，不管你是就着水泵管子直接喝，还是用杯子装着喝，统统无须付一个子儿。过来吧，先生们，都过来看看，放手畅饮吧！”</p></li>
<li><p>如果这样的叫卖声都招揽不到顾客，那可就太遗憾了。瞧，他们来了。这可真是炎热的一天啊，先生们。大口痛饮吧，然后再离开，好让你身上痛快地流出凉爽的汗水。这位朋友，再来一杯吧，好好漱漱你喉咙口的灰尘，它们厚得像是你皮鞋上沾满的尘土一样。能看得出，你今天已经跋涉了二十多里路。你可真是个聪明人，路上经过许多小酒馆，却只在小溪和井边停下来喝水。要不然，面对外面的炙热天气和体内的烈酒烧腹的里外夹攻，你早就被烧成灰烬了，或是像只水母那样，被热浪融化得一点不剩。</p></li>
<li><p>喝吧，再给那家伙腾出点儿地方，他来找我清醒一下昨晚的醉酒，那可不是从我的水管中倒给他的。欢迎，这位满面红光的先生！别急别急，我们在此之前素不相识，老实说，你满口的酒气太浓烈了，我的鼻子可不着急和你做这种亲密的近距离接触。</p></li>
<li><p>愿主怜悯你，先生！清水顺着你炽热的食道嘶嘶地流下，很快便转换成蒸汽，进入一个小小的灼热地狱，瞧你把自己的胃折腾成什么样了。再喝一口，然后像一名诚实的酒鬼那样告诉我，你可曾在任何一家小酒吧、酒馆或酒贩子那里，挥霍花尽你家孩子的伙食费，买到过这么好喝的饮料？现在，这十年来第一次，你尝到了清凉冷水的滋味。再见了，无论什么时候，当你渴了，别忘了我永远站在这个老地方，为你供应清水。</p></li>
<li><p>接下来是谁？哦，我的小朋友，你刚放了学，便跑来小镇水泵这里来喝口水，擦洗你年轻的小脸，遗忘掉被戒尺责打的记忆，和其他男孩带给你的麻烦。拿去吧，这水纯净得像是你年轻的生命，愿你的身心永远不会像现在这样受尽饥渴的折磨。</p></li>
<li><p>往旁边让让，我亲爱的孩子，放下杯子，给走过来的这位老先生让条路来。他踩在石板路上，脚步如此温柔迟缓，我几乎怀疑他是怕踏破这些石子。天哪！他竟然一瘸一拐就这么走过，压根没想到对我心存感激，难道我热情的款待好客就只是提供给那些没有酒窖的穷人吗？</p></li>
<li><p>算了，算了，先生，这也没什么！去吧，去拔出酒瓶上的软木塞，去往玻璃酒杯里倒上酒。但是，到时候你要是醉得跌了个狗啃泥，那可不关我的事。如果你们这些先生们喜好杯中之物，那我也管不着。瞧，这里有条饥渴的狗，正伸着它鲜红的舌头，它可不轻视我的殷勤好客。它用后腿直立着，热切趴在水槽旁边。瞧它离开的时候，脚步多欢快啊，你们就不羡慕这么畅快的痛饮吗？</p></li>
<li><p>请原谅我，善良的人们！我得打断一下我的连珠妙语，为这位从斯丹顿或沿着这条路的其他地方远道而来的赶车人和他的两头牛灌满水槽了。在我的工作中，再没有什么比为畜群提供饮水更快乐的事了。瞧！水槽上的水位降得多快啊，这两头牛咕咚咕咚地将水吞进它们庞大的胃里，很快就喝得肚鼓腰圆，不时地打上几声响嚏，发出快乐的喘息。现在，它们只是安静地环视着面前这庞大的饮水槽。牛才是真正的豪饮者。</p></li>
<li><p>我一向把自己看成时代的伟大改革家。从我的泵嘴里，以及成千上万像我这样的泵嘴里所吐出的涓流，能净化这世界上许多从炙热暴躁的心里所喷涌出的犯罪与痛苦。在这项伟大的事业中，奶牛是我的坚实同盟：我喷出的是水，它喷出的是奶！</p></li>
<li><p>咳，咳！发表演说还真是一件口干舌燥的事情，尤其是对我们这种初出茅庐的演说家而言。在此之前，我还从来不知道这些演讲者们所经历的辛劳。这位善良的基督徒，请帮忙压一两下泵好吗，好让我清凉一下喉咙。谢谢你，先生，我们继续吧。</p></li>
<li><p>小镇水泵和奶牛！这对光荣的合作伙伴，最终将垄断整个解渴行业。这一上帝佑福的完美组合！贫困终将从这片土地上消失，再也找不到一个悲惨的棚屋可以供她肮脏的躯体容身。没有人会再患病，因此疾病也将啃噬着自己，然后消亡。至于罪恶，哪怕不能完全泯灭，亦会苟存不多。</p></li>
<li><p>就这样，将不会有家庭战争。夫妻一起静静享受岁月姝好，携手走过温馨一生，面对死亡安详躺下，无怨无悔。在他们眼里，过去的生活并不是疯狂的暴风骤雨，未来也并不是一场醉酒后的谵热狂乱。他们死去的面容将反映出他们心灵的模样，那种回忆与希冀的微笑难以消逝。</p></li>
<li><p>喝吧，先生们，接下来你们会焕然一新！这水纯净而清凉，正如山间为饥渴的猎人解渴、在老树下潺潺流过的溪流一样。现在，这山林间的宝石被贮藏在这火热的石槽中，小镇上砖墙林立，看不到树荫。但是，这水仍然是健康、和平与幸福的源泉。尽管在我们父辈那一代，人们忽视了这捧清水的价值，但我仍坚定而喜悦地相信，总有一天，所有人会充分认同并赞赏它。</p></li>

<p>Samuel Griswold Goodrich (b. 1793, d. 1860) was born in Ridgefield,
Conn. Mr. Goodrich is best known as “Peter Parley,” under which assumed
name he commenced the publication of a series of Juvenile works about
1827. He edited “Parley’s Magazine” from 1841 to 1854. He was appointed
United States consul for Paris in 1848, and held that office four years.
He was a voluminous writer, and his works are interesting and popular.
His “Recollections of a Lifetime” was published in 1857, and “Peter
Parley’s Own Story” the year after his death.</p>

<p>AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL</p>
<p>传统守旧的女儿</p>
<p>Louisa May Alcott (b. 1833, d. 1888) was born at Germantown, Pa., of
New England parentage. Her parents afterwards returned to New England,
and most of her life was spent in Concord, Mass. During the Civil War
she went to Washington and nursed the wounded and sick until her own
health gave way. As a child she used to write stories for the amusement
of her playmates, and in 1857 published her first book, “Flower Fables.”
Her first novel, “Moods,” appeared in 1865. “Little Women,” published in
1868, is a picture of her own home life. “An Old-Fashioned Girl,” from
which this extract is adapted, was published in 1870, and is one of her
most popular books.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Polly hoped the “dreadful boy” (Tom) would not be present; but he
was, and stared at her all dinner time in a most trying manner.</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Shaw, a busy-looking gentleman, said, “How do you do, my
dear? Hope you’ll enjoy yourself;” and then appeared to forget her
entirely. Mrs. Shaw, a pale, nervous woman, greeted her little guest
kindly, and took care that she wanted for nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Madam Shaw, a quiet old lady, with an imposing [1] cap,
exclaimed, on seeing Polly, “Bless my heart! the image of her mother—a
sweet woman—how is she, dear?” and kept peering at the newcomer over her
glasses till, between Madam and Tom, poor Polly lost her
appetite.</p></li>
<li><p>Her cousin Fanny chatted like a magpie [2] , and little Maud
fidgeted, till Tom proposed to put her under the big dish cover, which
produced such an explosion that the young lady was borne screaming away
by the much-enduring nurse.</p></li>
<li><p>It was, altogether, an uncomfortable dinner, and Polly was very
glad when it was over. They all went about their own affairs; and, after
doing the honors of the house, Fan was called to the dressmaker, leaving
Polly to amuse herself in the great drawing-room.</p></li>
<li><p>Polly was glad to be alone for a few minutes; and, having
examined all the pretty things about her, began to walk up and down over
the soft, flowery carpet, humming to herself, as the daylight faded, and
only the ruddy glow of the fire filled the room.</p></li>
<li><p>Presently Madam came slowly in, and sat down in her armchair,
saying, “That’s a fine old tune; sing it to me, my dear. I have n’t
heard it this many a day.”</p></li>
<li><p>Polly did n’t like to sing before strangers, for she had no
teaching but such as her busy mother could give her; but she had been
taught the utmost respect for old people, and, having no reason for
refusing, she directly went to the piano and did as she was
bid.</p></li>
<li><p>“That’s the sort of music it’s a pleasure to hear. Sing some
more, dear,” said Madam, in her gentle way, when she had done.</p></li>
<li><p>Pleased with this praise, Polly sang away in a fresh little voice
that went straight to the listener’s heart and nestled there. The sweet
old tunes that one is never tired of were all Polly’s store. The more
she sung, the better she did it; and when she wound up with “A Health to
King Charlie,” the room quite rung with the stirring music made by the
big piano and the little maid.</p></li>
<li><p>“That’s a jolly tune! Sing it again, please,” cried Tom’s voice;
and there was Tom’s red head bobbing up over the high back of the chair
where he had hidden himself.</p></li>
<li><p>It gave Polly quite a turn, for she thought no one was hearing
her but the old lady dozing by the fire. “I can’t sing any more; I’m
tired,” she said, and walked away to Madam in the other room. The red
head vanished [3] like a meteor [4] , for Polly’s tone had been
decidedly cool.</p></li>
<li><p>The old lady put out her hand, and, drawing Polly to her knee,
looked into her face with such kind eyes that Polly forgot the
impressive cap, and smiled at her confidently [5] ; for she saw that her
simple music had pleased her listener, and she felt glad to know
it.</p></li>
<li><p>“You mus’n’t mind my staring, dear,” said Madam, softly pinching
her rosy cheek, “I haven’t seen a little girl for so long, it does my
old eyes good to look at you.” Polly thought that a very odd speech, and
could n’t help saying, “Are n’t Fan and Maud little girls,
too?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Oh, dear, no! not what I call little girls. Fan has been a young
lady this two years, and Maud is a spolled baby. Your mother’s a very
sensible woman, my child.”</p></li>
<li><p>“What a queer old lady!” thought Polly; but she said “Yes’m,”
respectfully, and looked at the fire. “You don’t understand what I mean,
do you?” asked Madam, still holding her by the chin. “No’m; not
quite.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Well, dear, I’ll tell you. In my day, children of fourteen and
fifteen did n’t dress in the height of the fashion; go to parties as
nearly like those of grown people as it’s possible to make them; lead
idle, giddy, unhealthy lives, and get blase’ [6] at twenty. We were
little folks till eighteen or so; worked and studied, dressed and
played, like children; honored our parents; and our days were much
longer in the land than now, it seems to me.”</p></li>
<li><p>The old lady appeared to forget Polly, at the end of her speech;
for she sat patting the plump little hand that lay in her own, and
looking up at a faded picture of an old gentleman with a ruffled shirt
and a queue. “Was he your father, Madam?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Yes, my dear; my honored father. I did up his frills to the day
of his death; and the first money I ever earned, was five dollars which
he offered as a prize to whichever of his six girls would lay the
handsomest darn in his silk stockings.”</p></li>
<li><p>“How proud you must have been!” cried Polly, leaning on the old
lady’s knee with an interested face.</p></li>
<li><p>“Yes; and we all learned to make bread, and cook, and wore little
chintz gowns, and were as gay and hearty as kittens. All lived to be
grandmothers; and I’m the last—seventy next birthday, my dear, and not
worn out yet; though daughter Shaw is an invalid [7] at forty.”</p></li>
<li><p>“That’s the way I was brought up, and that’s why Fan calls me
old-fashioned, I suppose. Tell more about your papa, please; I like it,”
said Polly.</p></li>
<li><p>“Say, ‘father.’ We never called him papa; and if one of my
brothers had addressed him as ‘governor,’ as boys now do, I really think
he’d have him cut off with a shilling.”</p></li>

<p>路易莎·梅·奥尔科特（1833—1888）出生于美国宾夕法尼亚州杰曼镇的一个具有新英格兰血统的家庭。她的父母后来回到新英格兰地区，而她一生中的大部分时间都在马萨诸塞州康科德市度过。内战期间，路易莎去了华盛顿，并在那里护理伤病员，直到她自己的健康情况恶化。当她还是个孩子的时候，她就经常为小伙伴们写故事逗趣。1857年，路易莎出版了她的第一本书《花的寓言》，她的第一部小说《情绪》于1865年问世，1868年出版的《小妇人》则是她自身家庭生活的写照。1870年出版的《传统的女儿》是她最受欢迎的作品之一，下面这段文章就节选自这本书。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>波莉希望那个“讨厌的男孩”汤姆不会在场，但他偏偏在，而且还用一种最令人坐立不安的目光盯着她吃完晚餐。</p></li>
<li><p>萧先生，一位看起来总是很忙碌的绅士，对她说：“你还好吗，我亲爱的？希望你玩得开心。”接着就似乎将她置之脑后了。萧夫人看起来面色苍白而紧张，她和颜悦色地招呼了她的小客人，并再三询问她是否还需要些什么。</p></li>
<li><p>萧老夫人，一位安静的老太太，戴着一顶颇为夸张的大帽子，一见到波莉便惊叫起来：“上帝呀！简直和她母亲长得一模一样——哦，你母亲可真是个大美人，亲爱的，她还好吗？”老太太坐在萧夫人和汤姆中间，一再从她的老花镜上端盯着这个新来的小客人，可怜的波莉只觉得食物难以下咽。</p></li>
<li><p>她的表姐范妮像一只喜鹊，叽叽喳喳地说个没完，而旁边的小茉德总是在座位上待不住，于是汤姆建议把她放到那个大号的菜盘罩子下面，没想到，居然让过来掀锅盖的一位年轻女士尖叫着跑开了，那种把戏实在超出了她的心理承受能力。</p></li>
<li><p>总之，这实在是顿令人不舒服的晚餐。当它终于结束时，波莉如释重负，顿时开心起来。大家都各自散去了，简单招待过波莉后，范妮被叫到裁缝那里去了，只留下波莉一个人在偌大的客厅里独自玩耍。</p></li>
<li><p>波莉很高兴，终于可以自己一个人待着。她四处看了看身边各种有趣的东西，在那块柔软的绣花地毯上走来走去，不断地哼着歌。夜晚降临了，壁炉里红润的火光照亮了整个客厅。</p></li>
<li><p>这时，萧老夫人步履迟缓地走进屋子，在她的扶手椅子上坐下，说：“这是一只很老的曲子，真好听。唱给我听吧，亲爱的，我很久没听过这首曲子了。”</p></li>
<li><p>在生人面前开口唱歌让波莉感到很是别扭。她从未接受过正规的声乐训练，只是从忙碌的母亲那儿学了一些。但是，长辈最应该获得尊重，这个道理她是清楚的。既然没有理由拒绝，她便走到钢琴边，开始弹唱起这首曲子。</p></li>
<li><p>“这种音乐，听着真让人心情舒畅。亲爱的，请多唱几首。”波莉唱完时，萧老夫人轻声说道。</p></li>
<li><p>听到老夫人的赞赏，波莉很开心。她清新童稚的声音悠扬婉转，穿透人心，悠悠然荡漾开来。这些甜美的经典老歌原本就是波莉的拿手好戏，她越唱越投入，一曲《祝查理王身体健康》达到高潮，整个房间都回荡着优美的钢琴声与小女孩美妙的嗓音。</p></li>
<li><p>“这个调子真欢乐！再唱一遍，好吗？”汤姆的声音冷不丁地冒出来。他的红头发突然从高背椅后边露出来，原来他一直藏在那里。</p></li>
<li><p>波莉吃了一惊。她原本以为，除了壁炉边那位开始犯困的老夫人以外，没有人在听她唱歌。“我不能再唱了，我累了。”她说着，一边向房间那头的老太太走去。波莉的语气里带着一种不容置疑的冷淡，于是，汤姆的红头发像流星般消失了。</p></li>
<li><p>老太太伸出手，将波莉拉到她的膝盖旁边，慈祥地看着小姑娘的脸。波莉早已忘记了老夫人头上那顶令人讨厌的大帽子，对她展开笑脸。波莉知道她的歌声使老太太感到快乐，想到这里，她觉得很开心。</p></li>
<li><p>“千万别介意我这样看着你，亲爱的。”老夫人说着，温柔地捏了捏小姑娘粉嫩的脸颊，“我已经很久没见到这样的小姑娘了。这样看着你，我也觉得神清气爽了。”波莉心想，这话可真奇怪。于是她忍不住问：“范妮和茉德不也是小姑娘吗？”</p></li>
<li><p>“哦，不，亲爱的！她们不是我所说的小姑娘。范妮这两年长大了，已经是一个年轻淑女了，而小茉德还是个被宠坏的孩子。你的母亲真是明晓事理，我的孩子。”</p></li>
<li><p>“老夫人说的话可真奇怪！”波莉心想，但她仍然尊敬地回答，“是的，夫人。”眼睛却盯着壁炉中的火光。“你不明白我的意思，是吗？”老夫人问道，仍然轻抚着波莉的下巴。“是的，夫人，我不太理解。”</p></li>
<li><p>“亲爱的，我来告诉你吧。在我们那个年代，十四五岁的女孩们不会穿着时尚的服饰，不会穿得像成人一样去参加聚会，不会过着一种游手好闲、轻浮而不健康的生活，然后在二十岁左右便腻烦这种安逸的日子。十八岁之前，我们都是些小姑娘，像个正常孩子一样每天干活、学习、玩耍、穿衣打扮，尊敬我们的父母长辈。我总觉得，与现在相比，那时的快乐时光舒坦实在得多。”</p></li>
<li><p>说到后面，老太太似乎已经忘记了波莉的存在。她坐在那里，忘神地轻轻拍着她手里那只丰润的小手，抬头看着一张泛黄的照片。照片中，一位老绅士穿着一件发皱的衬衫，头发系成辫状。“夫人，这是您的父亲吗？”</p></li>
<li><p>“是的，亲爱的，这就是我始终尊重的父亲。我一直为他整理衣物，直到他离开人世。我第一次挣到的钱，就是他奖励给我的。他说，如果六个女儿中哪个能将他的袜子补得最好，他便奖励她五美元。”</p></li>
<li><p>“您一定很骄傲！”波莉叫起来。她倚在老太太的膝盖上，饶有兴趣地扬起脸。</p></li>
<li><p>“那当然。我们所有姐妹都学会了烤面包、做饭，从小就穿着印着图案的棉布长裙，像群小猫咪似的健康活泼。我们每个人都当了祖母，我是最小的一个——明年就七十岁了，孩子，可我的身子骨还结实着呢。我的女儿萧才四十岁，却体弱多病。”</p></li>
<li><p>“这就是我接受的教育方式。我想，这大概也是为什么范妮总是叫我老古董。多说些您爸爸的事吧，求您了，我喜欢听。”波莉说。</p></li>
<li><p>“我们从来不叫他‘爸爸’，只称呼他‘父亲’，要是我的兄弟中有人叫他‘老爸’，就像现在男孩们习惯的那样，我想，父亲大概真的会甩给他一先令，然后剥夺他的继承权。”</p></li>

<p>THE DISCONTENTED PENDULUM</p>
<p>不满的钟摆</p>
<p>Jane Taylor (b. 1783, d. 1824) was born in London. Her mother was a
writer of some note. In connection with her sister Ann, Jane Taylor
wrote several juvenile works of more than ordinary excellence. Among
them were “Hymns for Infant Minds” and “Original Poems.” Besides these,
she wrote “Display, a Tale,” “Essays in Rhyme,” and “Contributions of
QQ.” Her writings are graceful, and often contain a useful moral.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>An old dock that had stood for fifty years in a farmer’s kitchen,
without giving its owner any cause of complaint, early one summer’s
morning, before the family was stirring, suddenly stopped. Upon this,
the dial plate (if we may credit the fable) changed countenance with
alarm; the hands made a vain effort to continue their course; the wheels
remained motionless with surprise; the weights hung speechless; and each
member felt disposed to lay the blame on the others. At length the dial
instituted [1] a formal inquiry as to the cause of the stagnation, when
hands, wheels, weights, with one voice, protested [2] their
innocence.</p></li>
<li><p>But now a faint tick was heard below from the pendulum, who spoke
thus: “I confess myself to be the sole cause of the present stoppage;
and I am willing, for the general satisfaction, to assign my reasons.
The truth is, that I am tired of ticking.” Upon hearing this, the old
clock became so enraged that it was upon the very point of striking.
“Lazy wire!” exclaimed the dial plate, holding up its hands.</p></li>
<li><p>“Very good!” replied the pendulum; “it is vastly easy for you,
Mistress Dial, who have always, as everybody knows, set yourself up
above me,—it is vastly easy for you, I say, to accuse other people of
laziness! you who have had nothing to do all your life but to stare
people in the face, and to amuse yourself with watching all that goes on
in the kitchen. Think, I beseech you, how you would like to be shut up
for life in this dark closet, and to wag backward and forward year after
year, as I do.”</p></li>
<li><p>“As to that,” said the dial, “is there not a window in your house
on purpose for you to look through?” “For all that,” resumed the
pendulum, “it is very dark here; and, although there is a window, I dare
not stop even for an instant to look out at it. Besides, I am really
tired of my way of life; and, if you wish, I’ll tell you how I took this
disgust at my employment. I happened, this morning, to be calculating
[3] how many times I should have to tick in the course of only the next
twenty-four hours; perhaps some one of you above there can give me the
exact sum.”</p></li>
<li><p>The minute hand, being quick at figures, presently replied,
“Eighty-six thousand four hundred times.” “Exactly so,” replied the
pendulum. “Well, I appeal to you all, if the very thought of this was
not enough to fatigue anyone; and when I began to multiply the strokes
of one day by those of months and years, really it was no wonder if I
felt discouraged at the prospect [4] . So, after a great deal of
reasoning and hesitation, thinks I to myself, I’ll stop.”</p></li>
<li><p>The dial could scarcely keep its countenance during this harangue
[5] ; but, resuming its gravity, thus replied: “Dear Mr. Pendulum, I am
really astonished that such a useful, industrious person as yourself
should have been seized by this sudden weariness. It is true, you have
done a great deal of work in your time; so have we all, and are likely
to do; which, although it may fatigue us to think of, the question is,
whether it will fatigue us to do. Would you now do me the favor to give
about half a dozen strokes to illustrate [6] my argument?”</p></li>
<li><p>The pendulum complied, and ticked six times at its usual pace.
“Now,” resumed the dial, “may I be allowed to inquire if that exertion
[7] is at all fatiguing or disagreeable to you?” “Not in the least,”
replied the pendulum; “it is not of six strokes that I complain, nor of
sixty, but of millions.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Very good,” replied the dial; “but recollect that, although you
may think of a million of strokes in an instant, you are required to
execute [8] but one; and that, however often you may hereafter have to
swing, a moment will always be given you to swing in.” “That
consideration [9] staggers me, I confess,” said the pendulum. “Then I
hope,” resumed the dial plate, “that we shall all return to our duty
immediately; for the maids will lie in bed if we stand idling
thus.”</p></li>
<li><p>Upon this, the weights, who had never been accused of light
conduct, used all their influence in urging him to proceed; when, as if
with one consent, the wheels began to turn, the hands began to move, the
pendulum began to swing, and, to its credit, ticked as loud as ever;
while a red beam of the rising sun, that streamed through a hole in the
kitchen, shining full upon the dial plate, it brightened up as if
nothing had been the matter.</p></li>
<li><p>When the farmer came down to breakfast that morning, upon looking
at the clock, he declared that his watch had gained half an hour in the
night.</p></li>

<li><p>在农夫的厨房里，有一座已经立了半世纪之久的老钟。老钟从未发生过故障，使主人有抱怨的机会。某个夏日清晨，在所有人起床之前，毫无缘由地，老钟突然停了。对此，表盘（我们不妨认为这不过是个寓言）惊诧地变了脸；指针们试图循着原有路程迈步，却徒然无力；齿轮们也惊讶地动弹不得；刻度们悬挂在那里，说不出一句话。老钟身上的每个成员都在琢磨着把过错归咎于他人。最后，表盘实施正规盘问，以查明老钟停止的原因。对此，指针、齿轮、刻度都异口同声地咬定自己是无辜的。</p></li>
<li><p>就在这时，一个微弱的嘀嗒声从老钟下方的钟摆处传来，它说：“我承认，我是本次停工的唯一原因。为了使在座各位满意，我愿意陈述我的理由。事实是，我实在厌倦了这样的反复嘀嗒。”听到这番话，整座老钟都愤怒起来，它几乎要再度敲响了。“你这个懒惰的家伙！”表盘叫起来，生气地扬着它的嵌条。</p></li>
<li><p>“你说得倒轻巧！”钟摆反唇相讥，“表盘夫人，大家都清楚你那高高在上的态度。对你来说，指责别人懒惰再容易不过了。你这一辈子做了些什么？无非就是瞪眼盯着别人看，不管厨房里发生了些什么，你都在一旁围观取乐。请你设身处地地为我想想，要是你终生被困在这个暗无天日的黑箱子里，像我这样年复一年地前后摇摆，你还会说得这么好听吗？”</p></li>
<li><p>“说到这一点，”表盘说，“难道不是特地为你安了个窗口，好让你能看到外面的世界？”“话是这么说，”钟摆继续抱怨道，“但这里太黑了。就算有一个窗口，我也不能停下哪怕一秒钟时间向外张望。再说，我实在厌倦了这种生活方式。如果你不介意的话，我倒很想告诉你这份工作有多么令人厌恶。今早，我碰巧计算了一下在接下来的二十四小时内，我需要来回嘀嗒多少次。你们上面诸位中也许有人能给我个准确数字？”</p></li>
<li><p>擅长于数字的分针很快回答：“86400次。”“一点儿也不错，”钟摆答道，“请你们大家都想想这个数字吧。如果它还不足以让你们感到疲惫，请再将这个数字按每天每月每年翻倍累计。一想到这些数字，我便觉得前途一片黯淡，生活毫无希望。因此，考虑再三后，我对自己说，我不愿再继续这种生活了。”</p></li>
<li><p>在钟摆发表这篇演说的时候，表盘几乎无法维持它的沉稳表情。但是，它很快便镇定下来，回答道：“亲爱的钟摆先生，我很震惊，一个像你这样勤勉能干的人竟然会被突如其来的倦意所压垮。确实，你做了大量的工作，但是，难道我们不也在努力干活，并且将继续这样做？尽管一想到这点，我们或许都疲惫不堪，但问题是：这份工作真的使我们厌倦吗？现在，为了解释我的观点，能否请你帮个忙，再嘀嗒几下？”</p></li>
<li><p>按照平常的节奏，钟摆顺从地嘀嗒了六下。“好了，”表盘接着说，“请问，像这样摆动六下，是否让你厌倦心烦？”“一点也不，”钟摆回答道，“但是，我抱怨的不是六下，也不是六十下，而是数以百万计的无数个六下。”</p></li>
<li><p>“很好，”表盘说道，“但是，你想一下，尽管你在顷刻间便想到要嘀嗒数百万次，但实际上，你只需要嘀嗒一次。不管以后你还需要嘀嗒摇摆多少次，每一秒钟你都只需要嘀嗒一次。”“我承认，这么想的确令我好受些。”“那么，我希望，”表盘说，“我们大家能立即重新开始工作。如果我们继续站在这里闲聊，女主人们就会一直赖在床上。”</p></li>
<li><p>听到这话，从未被指责过工作轻巧的刻度们，也纷纷向钟摆施加影响，建议它继续工作。最后，大家终于达成一致意见，齿轮们开始转动，指针们开始迈步，钟摆也开始摆动。值得称道的是，它的嘀嗒声与以前一样铿锵有力。当朝阳的红色光芒从厨房的一个洞口处流泻进来，映在表盘上，表盘熠熠生辉，仿佛什么事都不曾发生过。</p></li>
<li><p>那天早晨，那位农夫走进厨房吃早餐，他看着老钟对了对表，说，他的表昨晚快了半个小时。</p></li>

<p>THE DEATH OF THE FLOWERS</p>
<p>花朵的死亡</p>
<p>William Cullen Bryant (b. 1794, d. 1878) was born in Cummington,
Mass. He entered Williams College at the age of sixteen, but was
honorably dismissed at the end of two years. At the age of twenty-one he
was admitted to the bar, and practiced his profession successfully for
nine years. In 1826 he removed to New York, and became connected with
the “Evening Post”—a connection which continued to the time of his
death. His residence for more than thirty of the last years of his life
was at Roslyn, Long Island. He visited Europe several times; and in 1849
he continued his travels into Egypt and Syria. In all his poems,
Mr. Bryant exhibits a remarkable love for, and a careful study of,
nature. His language, both in prose and verse, is always chaste,
correct, and elegant. “Thanatopsis,” perhaps the best known of all his
poems, was written when he was but nineteen. His excellent translations
of the “Iliad” and the “Odyssey” of Homer and some of his best poems,
were written after he had passed the age of seventy. He retained his
powers and his activity till the close of his life.</p>

<p>THE THUNDERSTORM</p>
<p>暴风雨</p>
<p>Washington Irving (b. 1783, d. 1859). This distinguished author,
whose works have enriched American literature, was born in the city of
New York. He had an ordinary school education, and began his literary
career at the age of nineteen, by writing for a paper published by his
brother. His first book, “Salmagundi,” was published in 1807. Two years
later he published “Knickerbocker’s History of New York.” In 1815 he
sailed for Europe, and remained abroad seventeen years, during which
time he wrote several of his works. From 1842 to 1846 he was minister to
Spain. The last years of his life were passed at “Sunnyside [1] ,” near
Tarrytown, N.Y. He was never married. “The Life of Washington,” his last
work, was completed in the same year in which he died. Mr. Irving’s
works are characterized by humor, chaste sentiment, and elegance and
correctness of expression. The following selection is from “Dolph” in
“Bracebridge Hall.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the second day of the voyage, they came to the Highlands. It
was the latter part of a calm, sultry day, that they floated gently with
the tide between these stern mountains. There was that perfect quiet
which prevails over nature in the languor [2] of summer heat. The
turning of a plank, or the accidental falling of an oar, on deck, was
echoed from the mountain side and reverberated along the shores; and, if
by chance the captain gave a shout of command, there were airy tongues
that mocked it from every cliff.</p></li>
<li><p>Dolph gazed about him, in mute delight and wonder, at these
scenes of nature’s magnificence. To the left, the Dunderberg reared its
woody precipices, height over height, forest over forest, away into the
deep summer sky. To the right, strutted forth the bold promontory of
Antony’s Nose, with a solitary eagle wheeling about it; while beyond,
mountain succeeded to mountain, until they seemed to lock their arms
together and confine this mighty rive in their embraces.</p></li>
<li><p>In the midst of this admiration, Dolph remarked [3] a pile of
bright, snowy clouds peering above the western heights. It was succeeded
by another, and another, each seemingly pushing onward its predecessor
[4] , and towering, with dazzling brilliancy, in the deep blue
atmosphere; and now muttering peals of thunder were faintly heard
rolling behind the mountains. The river, hitherto still and glassy,
reflecting pictures of the sky and land, now showed a dark ripple at a
distance, as the wind came creeping up it. The fishhawks wheeled and
screamed, and sought their nests on the high, dry trees; the crows flew
clamorously [5] to the crevices of the rocks; and all nature seemed
conscious of the approaching thunder gust.</p></li>
<li><p>The clouds now rolled in volumes over the mountain tops; their
summits still bright and snowy, but the lower parts of an inky
blackness. The rain began to patter down in broad and scattered drops;
the wind freshened, and curled up the waves; at length, it seemed as if
the bellying [6] clouds were torn open by the mountain tops, and
complete torrents of rain came rattling down. The lightning leaped from
cloud to cloud, and streamed quivering against the rocks, splitting and
rending the stoutest forest trees. The thunder burst in tremendous
explosions; the peals were echoed from mountain to mountain; they
crashed upon Dunderberg, and then rolled up the long defile [7] of the
Highlands, each headland making a new echo, until old Bull Hill seemed
to bellow back the storm.</p></li>
<li><p>For a time the scudding rack [8] and mist and the sheeted rain
almost hid the landscape from the sight. There was a fearful gloom,
illumined still more fearfully by the streams of lightning which
glittered among the raindrops. Never had Dolph beheld such an absolute
warring of the elements [9] ; it seemed as if the storm was tearing and
rending its way through the mountain defile, and had brought all the
artillery of heaven into action.</p></li>

<p>华盛顿·欧文（1783—1859），著名作家，其作品极大地丰富了美国文学宝库。他出生于美国纽约，接受了普通的学校教育。十九岁时，欧文为他哥哥出版的报纸写稿，并由此开始了自己的文学生涯。他的第一本书《大杂烩》出版于1807年，两年后，他出版了《荷兰裔移民的纽约开拓史》。
1815年，欧文乘船去了欧洲，滞留海外长达十七年之久，期间完成了数部作品。从1842年至1846年，他出任美国驻西班牙公使。在纽约州塔里顿附近的“阳光畔”，欧文度过生命中的最后时光。他终生未婚。他最后一部著作，《乔治·华盛顿传》在他生命的最后一年完成。欧文的作品特点是蕴涵幽默，情感质朴，文辞表达精确优雅。下文节选自《布雷斯布里奇田庄》一书中的《道尔夫》章节。</p>

<li><p>旅途的第二天，船只抵达哈德逊高地。当时天近傍晚，无风、闷热，在崇山峻岭之间，他们的船儿顺流轻轻漂流。在夏日午后慵懒的空气中，天地间一片静谧安宁。船舷时而偏转，船桨偶然跌落在甲板上，哪怕一点细微声音，都会撞击山体旋即沿着山涧两岸依次荡开。要是船长碰巧扯着嗓子吆喝了一句，四周峭壁也会随声附和，回声悠扬。</p></li>
<li><p>道尔夫出神地凝望着四周大自然中的壮观美景，心里充满了无言的快乐与惊奇。从左舷看，此刻，“邓德伯格号”船向他展露青翠的峭崖，一层层山崖，一层层绿意，直插入夏日深邃的天空中去。从右舷看，那块硕大突起的险峰便是“安东尼的鼻子”，一只孤独的苍鹰在它上方盘旋着。放眼望去，山峦叠嶂，仿佛它们已经联手将这片区域锁住，将这条伟大的哈德逊河禁锢在它们的怀抱中。</p></li>
<li><p>道尔夫正沉浸在观幽探奇，突然，他看到一簇明晃晃的厚实云团，在西边天际若隐若现，随后，又飘过来一簇云团，又涌来一团……不断迭现翻滚，在深邃湛蓝的天空中，展示出令人神晕目眩的壮观气势。现在，已能隐隐听见低沉轰鸣的雷声从山岭背后滚来。一秒钟前仍澄明如镜，映射着风景如画的天空和山岭的哈德逊河，随着风在水面上呼啸而过，也开始从远处漾起一圈暗色的涟漪。鱼鹰急速盘旋着，尖叫着，寻找着它们筑在高处树梢上的巢窝；乌鸦呱噪着，飞往岩石间的裂缝。自然万物无不惊悚，似乎已经觉察到一场暴风雨将顷刻来临。</p></li>
<li><p>厚密的云层翻卷着滚过道道山峦。云层上方，仍然明亮得像雪一样；但下层的云团，已是一片墨黑。雨滴开始噼里啪啦地疏散落下，风带着雨水的清新，卷起河面上的浪花。终于，不断囤积的云层像是被山峰一把撕开，狂暴的骤雨滂沱而下。闪电在云层间跳跃着，颤抖着撞击岩石，猛烈撕扯着劈开那些高大结实的树木。震耳欲聋的雷声一阵阵炸响，轰鸣声在山谷间回荡，撞击着“邓德伯格号”船舷，然后越过哈德逊高地的绵长峡谷，每逢凸崖，势必炸开一声新的回响。回音一直传递下去，直到远处的公牛山也哞哞吼叫，将暴风骤雨发狂地撵开。</p></li>
<li><p>一时间，碎云飞驰，浓密的雨雾笼罩大地，雨帘倾泻而下，天地间一片阴暗朦胧。在这令人恐惧的晦暗中，接二连三的闪电穿过雨滴，迸出一道道刺目光亮，那么瘆人惨白，狰狞可怖。道尔夫从未见过这样壮烈的景象，仿佛水、火、土、气这些元素在天地间激烈地交战。暴风雨撕裂着山岭峡谷，似乎将天上的箭矢枪炮一应辎重悉数投入了战场。</p></li>

<p>Caroline Anne Southey (b. 1786, d.1854), the second wife of Southey
the poet, and better known as Caroline Bowles, was born near Lymington,
Hampshire, England. Her first work, “Ellen Fitzarthur,” a poem, was
published in 1820; and for more than twenty years her writings were
published anonymously. In 1839 she was married to Mr. Southey, and
survived him over ten years. Her poetry is graceful in expression, and
full of tenderness, though somewhat melancholy. The following extract
first appeared in 1822 in a collection entitled, “The Widow’s Tale, and
other Poems.”</p>

<li><p>There it stood, in its little green vase, on a light ebony stand
in the window of the drawing-room. The rich satin curtains, with their
costly fringes, swept down on either side of it, and around it glittered
every rare and fanciful trifle which wealth can offer to luxury, and yet
that simple rose was the fairest of them all. So pure it looked, its
white leaves just touched with that delicious, creamy tint peculiar to
its kind: its cup so full, so perfect, its head bending, as if it were
sinking and melting away in its own richness.—Oh! when did ever man make
anything to equal the living, perfect flower!</p></li>
<li><p>But the sunlight that streamed through the window revealed
something fairer than the rose—a young lady reclining on an ottoman [1]
, who was thus addressed by her livelier cousin: “I say, cousin, I have
been thinking what you are to do with your pet rose when you go to New
York; as, to our consternation, you are determined to do. You know it
would be a sad pity to leave it with such a scatter-brain as I am. I
love flowers, indeed,—that is, I like a regular bouquet, cut off and
tied up, to carry to a party; but as to all this tending and fussing
which is needful to keep them growing, I have no gifts in that
line.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Make yourself easy as to that, Kate,” said Florence, with a
smile; “I have no intention of calling upon your talents; I have an
asylum [2] in view for my favorite.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Oh, then you know just what I was going to say. Mrs. Marshall, I
presume, has been speaking to you; she was here yesterday, and I was
quite pathetic [3] upon the subject; telling her the loss your favorite
would sustain, and so forth; and she said how delighted she would be to
have it in her greenhouse; it is in such a fine state now, so full of
buds. I told her I knew you would like to give it to her; you are so
fond of Mrs. Marshall, you know.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Now, Kate, I am sorry, but I have otherwise engaged.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Whom can it be to? you have so few intimates here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it is only one of my odd fancies.”</p>
<p>“But do tell me, Florence.”</p>
<p>“Well, cousin, you know the little pale girl to whom we give
sewing?”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>“What! little Mary Stephens? How absurd, Florence! This is just
another of your motherly, old-maidish ways; dressing dolls for poor
children, making bonnets, and knitting socks for all the little dirty
babies in the neighborhood. I do believe you have made more calls in
those two vile, ill-smelling alleys behind our house than ever you have
in Chestnut Street, though you know everybody is half dying to see you;
and now, to crown all, you must give this choice little bijou [4] to a
seamstress girl, when one of your most intimate friends, in your own
class, would value it so highly. What in the world can people in their
circumstances [5] want with flowers?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Just the same as I do,” replied Florence, calmly. “Have you not
noticed that the little girl never comes without looking wistfully at
the opening buds? And don’t you remember, the other morning she asked me
so prettily if I would let her mother come and see it, she was so fond
of flowers?”</p></li>
<li><p>“But, Florence, only think of this rare flower standing on a
table with ham, eggs, cheese, and flour, and stifled in that close
little room, where Mrs. Stephens and her daughter manage to wash, iron,
and cook.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Well, Kate, and if I were obliged to live in one coarse room,
and wash, and iron, and cook, as you say; if I had to spend every moment
of my time in toil, with no prospect from my window but a brick wall and
a dirty lane, such a flower as this would be untold enjoyment to
me.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Pshaw, Florence; all sentiment [6] ! Poor people have no time to
be sentimental. Besides, I don’t believe it will grow with them; it is a
greenhouse flower, and used to delicate living.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Oh, as to that, a flower never inquires whether its owner is
rich or poor; and poor Mrs. Stephens, whatever else she has not, has
sunshine of as good quality as this that streams through our window. The
beautiful things that God makes are his gifts to all alike. You will see
that my fair rose will be as well and cheerful in Mrs. Stephens’s room
as in ours.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Well, after all, how odd! When one gives to poor people, one
wants to give them something useful—a bushel of potatoes, a ham, and
such things.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Why, certainly, potatoes and ham must be supplied; but, having
ministered to the first and most craving wants, why not add any other
little pleasures or gratifications we may have it in our power to
bestow? I know there are many of the poor who have fine feeling and a
keen sense of the beautiful, which rusts out and dies because they are
too hard pressed to procure it any gratification. Poor Mrs. Stephens,
for example; I know she would enjoy birds, and flowers, and music as
much as I do. I have seen her eye light up as she looked upon these
things in our drawing-room, and yet not one beautiful thing can she
command [7] . From necessity, her room, her clothing,—all she has, must
be coarse and plain. You should have seen the almost rapture [8] she and
Mary felt when I offered them my rose.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Dear me! all this may be true, but I never thought of it before.
I never thought that these hard-working people had any ideas of taste
[9] !”</p></li>
<li><p>“Then why do you see the geranium or rose so carefully nursed in
the old cracked teapot in the poorest room, or the morning-glory planted
in a box and twined about the window? Do not these show that the human
heart yearns [10] for the beautiful in all ranks of life? You remember,
Kate, how our washerwoman sat up a whole night, after a hard day’s work,
to make her first baby a pretty dress to be baptized in.” “Yes, and I
remember how I laughed at you for making such a tasteful little cap for
it.”</p></li>
<li><p>“True, Kate, but I think the look of perfect delight with which
the poor woman regarded her baby in its new dress and cap was something
quite worth creating; I do believe she could not have felt more grateful
if I had sent her a barrel of flour.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Well, I never thought before of giving anything to the poor but
what they really needed, and I have always been willing to do that when
I could without going far out of my way.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Ah! cousin, if our heavenly Father gave to us after this mode,
we should have only coarse, shapeless piles of provisions lying about
the world, instead of all this beautiful variety of trees, and fruits,
and flowers,”</p></li>
<li><p>“Well, well, cousin, I suppose you are right, but have mercy on
my poor head; it is too small to hold so many new ideas all at once, so
go on your own way;” and the little lady began practicing a waltzing
step before the glass with great satisfaction.</p></li>

<li><p>它立在那儿。在起居室窗台旁边的浅乌檀色架子上，那株香水月季插在一个小小的绿色花瓶里。那奢华的绸缎窗帘，配着昂贵的窗饰挂幔流苏，垂落在小花瓶的两旁。房间里，到处摆满了亮闪闪的稀罕物件，满目珠光宝气，满屋奢贵豪华，但是，这株简单的香水月季当属鹤立鸡群，素朴中透着清纯可爱，奶白色叶瓣诱人丰润，带着奶油般的独特色泽，它的花瓣精致饱满，花朵低垂着头，仿佛连它自己都沉浸于自身丰盈之美里——啊！这精美生物，岂是人类所能创造出来的？</p></li>
<li><p>阳光流泻过窗户，香水月季旁边更为亮眼——一位年轻女子斜倚在软垫上，身边活泼好动的表妹正在与她聊天：“我说，表姐，我一直在想，等你去纽约的时候，你这株宝贝月季打算怎么办？我们都很诧异，你怎么坚持要走。你知道，要是把它留给一个像我这种粗心大意的人，那可就太可惜了。我喜欢花儿，这是当然的——我喜欢那些修剪包扎好的花束，可以捧着去参加晚会的那种，但是要让我去悉心照顾、打理它们，等它们开花，我可就做不到了。”</p></li>
<li><p>“别那么紧张，凯蒂，”佛罗伦萨微笑着说，“我没打算劳烦你帮忙，我心里已经想好这株花的去处了。”</p></li>
<li><p>“哦，那你一定清楚我打算对你说什么了。我猜，马歇尔夫人已经跟你聊过了吧。她昨天来这儿，一跟她谈起你要离开，我就很难过。我跟她说起，你最心爱的花很快就没人照顾了，诸如此类。她说，如果你愿意将这株香水月季送给她，挪到她家的温室里，她会很开心的。眼看花就要开了，这么多含苞待放的花蕾。我对她说，我知道你一定愿意送给她。你一向都很喜欢马歇尔夫人，我没说错吧？”</p></li>
<li><p>“哦，凯蒂，我很抱歉，可我已经决定将它送给别人了。”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“还会是谁？在这儿，你身边根本就没几个亲密的人。”</p>
<p>“没什么，只是我的一个古怪想法罢了。”</p>
<p>“你一定得告诉我，佛罗伦萨。”</p>
<p>“好吧，表妹，你还记得上次帮我们做缝纫活的那个面色苍白的小女孩吗？”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>“什么！你说的是小玛丽·史蒂芬斯？太可笑了，佛罗伦萨！你又开始做这些婆婆妈妈、怪异迂腐的事情了，为穷孩子们缝娃娃啦，缝小帽子啦，为附近那些脏兮兮的婴儿们钩织袜子什么的。我真觉得，你在我们屋后这两条臭气熏天的低贱小巷里花的时间，比在前面这条名流如云的栗树大道上花的时间更多。你明明知道，这些上流社会的先生夫人们都很喜欢看见你。你做了这些还不够，现在，竟然还打算将这株珍贵的宝石送给一个做缝活的小女孩？要知道，有一位和你一样出生高贵的夫人也喜欢这株花，何况她还是你的闺密好友。我真想不通，那些下贱的人拿了花能有什么用？”</p></li>
<li><p>“和我一样。”佛罗伦萨平心静气地说，“你难道没注意到，那个小女孩每次来我们这儿，总是期盼地看着那些快要盛开的花苞？你难道不记得，那天早上，她面带羞涩地问我，能不能带她妈妈来看看这株花，因为她也很喜欢花？”</p></li>
<li><p>“可是，佛罗伦萨，你倒是想想：将这朵名贵的花和那些火腿呀、鸡蛋、奶酪和面粉什么的放在一起，摆在他们那间狭窄小屋的桌上，史蒂芬斯夫人和她的女儿还要在这张桌上洗涮、熨烫、做饭——多不搭调呀！”</p></li>
<li><p>“可是，凯蒂，如果我被迫居住在一间简陋的破屋里，还要像你说的这样，忙着洗涮、熨烫、做饭；如果我忙着辛勤劳作，没有片刻空闲，窗外满眼只有颓败坍塌的砖墙，肮脏不堪的街巷，这朵花能带给我的，难道不是莫大的享受吗？”</p></li>
<li><p>“算了吧，佛罗伦萨，你太多愁善感了！穷人哪有时间像你这么感情用事。再说了，我可不相信这株香水月季会在那种地方开放。这株娇嫩名贵的花只适合种在温室里，它习惯了精致的生活。”</p></li>
<li><p>“哦，对于这一点，花朵从不在意它的主人是富有还是贫穷。可怜的斯蒂芬斯夫人也许没有其他东西，但她所拥有的阳光，和透过窗户流泻在我们屋里的阳光一样灿烂。上帝创造出来的这些美好事物，是他给予所有人的馈赠。你会看到，这株可爱的月季在史蒂芬斯夫人的房间里，会长得像在我们房间里一样美丽而快乐的。”</p></li>
<li><p>“好了好了，不管怎么说，你的想法都太奇怪了！如果一个人想施舍点什么给穷人，通常都会给他们些实用的东西，比如一袋土豆，或一条火腿什么的。”</p></li>
<li><p>“当然，土豆和火腿都是必不可少的。但是，在满足他们最重要也最渴望得到的东西以后，为什么不为他们提供一些我们有能力提供的精神上的快乐与满足呢？我知道，许多穷人都情感丰富，对美丽的事物也相当敏锐，但是，因为他们生活太过艰难，所以往往钝化了内心对美的敏感。就拿可怜的史蒂芬斯夫人为例吧，她对啁啾的鸟儿、鲜艳的花朵和悦耳的音乐的喜爱之情，并不在我之下。当她来到我们的客厅时，看着房间里的装饰品，我看到她欣喜的眼神闪闪发亮，但她却无力买下任何一件美丽的艺术品。她所有的东西——从生活必需品，到她的房间、她的衣服，都只能是粗糙简朴的。当我告诉她和小玛丽，我想把这株香水月季送给她们的时候，你真该看看她们脸上欣喜若狂的表情。”</p></li>
<li><p>“天哪！这些或许不假，可我从来就没想过这些。我从来就不知道，这些只知道苦力劳作的穷人竟然也有欣赏品位！”</p></li>
<li><p>“那你怎么不想想，为什么在那些穷家陋户中，总能看到用破陋茶壶种着精心调养的天竺葵或玫瑰，或是窗户上缠绕着种植在盒子里的牵牛花藤？这些难道不是表明，无论生命的等级高贵或低贱，人们的内心都同样渴望着美丽的事物？你还记得吗，凯蒂，我们的洗衣女工辛劳工作了一整天后回到家，又熬了一个晚上，为她第一个孩子的受洗仪式缝制了漂亮的小裙子？”“是啊，我还记得那时我嘲笑过你，费心劳神地做了一顶那么雅致的婴儿帽。”</p></li>
<li><p>“是的，凯蒂，我觉得，当那个可怜的女人看见自己的宝宝穿上新衣，戴上新帽时，她脸上那完美的喜悦，值得我为她那么做。我相信，哪怕我送她一整桶面粉，也无法换来她那时的感激之情。”</p></li>
<li><p>“好吧，我可从来没想过，除了给那些穷人一些生活必需品以外，还能给他们一些别的东西。只要不太麻烦，我还是很愿意接济他们那些必需品的。”</p></li>
<li><p>“啊！表妹，如果我们在天上的父也按这样的想法来赐予我们，那么在这世上，我们除了能拥有那些粗鄙难看的东西以外，大概就不会有现在这些各种各样美丽的树木、水果和鲜花了。”</p></li>
<li><p>“行了，行了，表姐，就算你是对的吧。但是，饶了我这不开窍的可怜脑瓜吧，它太小了，怎能转眼装下这么多新奇的念头。你爱怎么做就怎么做吧。”于是，对着镜子，这名小淑女又开始顾影自怜地练习起她的华尔兹舞步来了。</p></li>

<h2 id="lesson-39-3">LESSON 39</h2>
<p>THE BOBOLINK</p>
<p>北美食米鸟</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The happiest bird of our spring, however, and one that rivals the
European lark in my estimation, is the boblincoln, or bobolink as he is
commonly called. He arrives at that choice portion of our year which, in
this latitude, answers to the description of the month of May so often
given by the poets. With us it begins about the middle of May, and lasts
until nearly the middle of June. Earlier than this, winter is apt to
return on its traces, and to blight the opening beauties of the year;
and later than this, begin the parching, and panting, and dissolving
heats of summer. But in this genial interval, Nature is in all her
freshness and fragrance: “the rains are over and gone, the flowers
appear upon the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the
voice of the turtle is heard in the land.”</p></li>
<li><p>The trees are now in their fullest foliage and brightest verdure;
the woods are gay with the clustered flowers of the laurel; the air is
perfumed with the sweetbrier and the wild rose; the meadows are enameled
[1] with clover blossoms; while the young apple, peach, and the plum
begin to swell, and the cherry to glow among the green leaves.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the chosen season of revelry of the bobolink. He comes
amid the pomp and fragrance of the season; his life seems all
sensibility [2] and enjoyment, all song and sunshine. He is to be found
in the soft bosoms of the freshest and sweetest meadows, and is most in
song when the clover is in blossom. He perches on the topmost twig of a
tree, or on some long, flaunting weed, and, as he rises and sinks with
the breeze, pours forth a succession of rich, tinkling notes, crowding
one upon another, like the outpouring melody of the skylark, and
possessing the same rapturous character.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes he pitches from the summit of a tree, begins his song
as soon as he gets upon the wing, and flutters tremulously down to the
earth, as if overcome with ecstasy at his own music. Sometimes he is in
pursuit of his mate; always in full song, as if he would win her by his
melody; and always with the same appearance of intoxication and delight.
Of all the birds of our groves and meadows, the bobolink was the envy of
my boyhood. He crossed my path in the sweetest weather, and the sweetest
season of the year, when all nature called to the fields, and the rural
feeling throbbed in every bosom; but when I, luckless urchin! was doomed
to be mewed [3] up, during the livelong day, in a schoolroom.</p></li>
<li><p>It seemed as if the little varlet [4] mocked at me as he flew by
in full song, and sought to taunt me with his happier lot. Oh, how I
envied him! No lessons, no task, no school; nothing but holiday, frolic,
green fields, and fine weather. Had I been then more versed [5] in
poetry, I might have addressed him in the words of Logan [6] to the
cuckoo:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Sweet bird, thy bower is ever green,</p>
<p>Thy sky is ever clear;</p>
<p>Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,</p>
<p>No winter in thy year.</p>
<p>Oh, could I fly, I’d fly with thee!</p>
<p>We’d make, with joyful wing,</p>
<p>Our annual visit o’er the globe,</p>
<p>Companions of the spring.”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Further observation and experience have given me a different idea
of this feathered voluptuary [7] , which I will venture to impart for
the benefit of my young readers, who may regard him with the same
unqualified envy and admiration which I once indulged. I have shown him
only as I saw him at first, in what I may call the poetical part of his
career, when he, in a manner, devoted himself to elegant pursuits and
enjoyments, and was a bird of music, and song, and taste, and
sensibility, and refinement. While this lasted he was sacred from
injury; the very schoolboy would not fling a stone at him, and the
merest rustic would pause to listen to his strain.</p></li>
<li><p>But mark the difference. As the year advances, as the clover
blossoms disappear, and the spring fades into summer, he gradually gives
up his elegant tastes and habits, doffs his poetical suit of black,
assumes a russet, dusty garb, and sinks to the gross enjoyment of common
vulgar birds. His notes no longer vibrate on the ear; he is stuffing
himself with the seeds of the tall weeds on which he lately swung and
chanted so melodiously. He has become a bon vivant [8] , a gourmand [9]
: with him now there is nothing like the “joys of the table.” In a
little while he grows tired of plain, homely fare, and is off on a
gastronomic [10] tour in quest of foreign luxuries.</p></li>
<li><p>We next hear of him, with myriads of his kind, banqueting among
the reeds of the Delaware, and grown corpulent [11] with good feeding.
He has changed his name in traveling. Boblincoln no more, he is the
reedbird now, the much-sought-for tidbit of Pennsylvanian epicures [12]
, the rival in unlucky fame of the ortolan [13] ! Wherever he goes, pop!
pop! pop! every rusty firelock in the country is blazing away. He sees
his companions falling by thousands around him. Does he take warning and
reform? Alas! not he. Again he wings his flight. The rice swamps of the
south invite him. He gorges himself among them almost to bursting; he
can scarcely fly for corpulency. He has once more changed his name, and
is now the famous ricebird of the Carolinas. Last stage of his career:
behold him spitted, with dozens of his corpulent companions, and served
up, a vaunted [14] dish, on some southern table.</p></li>
<li><p>Such is the story of the bobolink; once spiritual, musical,
admired, the joy of the meadows, and the favorite bird of spring;
finally, a gross little sensualist, who expiates [15] his sensuality in
the larder [16] . His story contains a moral worthy the attention of all
little birds and little boys; warning them to keep to those refined and
intellectual pursuits which raised him to so high a pitch of popularity
during the early part of his career, but to eschew [17] all tendency to
that gross and dissipated indulgence which brought this mistaken little
bird to an untimely end.</p></li>

<li><p>在我看来，在北美，能与欧洲云雀媲美的、春天最快乐的鸟，大概便是食米鸟了。食米鸟，boblincoln，但人们通常叫它bobolink。它一年中选择飞到这片土地的季节，是诗人笔下描述的五月。它每年通常五月中旬到来，盘桓此地将近一月。早前，寒冷的冬天仍时不时地留下踪迹，让盛开的花朵霜冻枯萎；再晚些日子，炙热难熬、令人汗流浃背的夏天便开始了。只有气候和煦的五月，大自然散发出她所有的清新和芬芳：“雨季已经过去，大地上花朵绽放，鸟儿鸣啾，海龟也爬上岸来。”</p></li>
<li><p>树木枝繁叶茂，正是绿意盎然的时候，树林间洋溢着一簇簇月桂花的馨香；空气中，弥漫着一片蔷薇和野玫瑰甜美浓郁的芳香；草地上铺满苜蓿花朵；新长出来的苹果、桃子和李子正渐渐长大，鲜红的樱桃在绿叶间容光焕发。</p></li>
<li><p>这正是食米鸟选择的狂欢季节。它趁着这飘香的盛大庆典飞来，它的生活充满了感性和享受，满是悦耳的歌声和灿烂的阳光。在那最新鲜、最柔软的草地上，在苜蓿花细碎盛开的地方，你总能看到它在鸣啾歌唱。它栖息在树顶的枝桠上，或是站在长长的随风摇摆的野草上；它随着春风飞上天空，又俯冲到地面。它歌唱出一连串银铃般的美妙音符，清脆的鸣啾此起彼伏，宛如云雀天籁般的歌喉，充满同样快乐和热烈的质感。</p></li>
<li><p>有时，它从树梢向地面坠下，一张开翅膀便放声高歌，然后在歌声中颤抖着降落到地面，仿佛在自己的音乐中陶醉忘形；有时，它用一整首歌来求偶，似乎雌鸟也会因它的歌喉而倾心；无论何时，它看起来总是那么快乐、沉醉。在林间和草地上所有这些鸟类当中，食米鸟是我童年时代最羡慕的鸟儿。在一年中最美妙的季节里，气候适宜，当万物都呼唤着田野、当每枝嫩芽都蓬勃跳动着田园情愫的时候，食米鸟便会在我上学的小路上穿梭飞行。而我，这个倒霉蛋！却只能乖乖闭嘴，在这样漫长美好的一天中被囚禁在教室里。</p></li>
<li><p>当它从我身边飞过，快乐啁啾着的时候，这个小恶棍看起来就像是在嘲笑我，用它的幸福日子来奚落我。哦，我羡慕死它了！没有功课，没有作业，也没有学校，它的全部生活就是假期、嬉闹、绿色的田野和晴朗的天气。如果我有诗歌天赋的话，我大概会用洛根写给杜鹃的诗来形容它：</p></li>
</ol>
<p>甜美的鸟儿，</p>
<p>你的窝巢四季常青，</p>
<p>你的天空始终清澈，</p>
<p>你的歌声中没有悲伤，</p>
<p>你的岁月里没有寒冬。</p>
<p>哦，如果我能飞，</p>
<p>我愿与你一起飞翔！</p>
<p>张开幸福的翅膀，</p>
<p>我们飞越环球，</p>
<p>始终与春天同行。</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>但是，进一步的观察和体验，让我对这只身披羽裳的酒肉之徒产生了全新的认识。鉴于年轻读者的需要，我乐于勇敢地传教。因为，你们可能也曾像我一样，过高地羡慕和钦佩食米鸟。当第一眼看到它，我便为之心颤，称它具有生命的诗意。从某种意义上来说，它致力于优雅的追求和享受，迷恋音乐、歌声，关注品位、感性和优雅。因此，这种神圣的鸟儿不容丝毫伤害，甚至连学校那些淘气鬼们也不会冲它投掷石块，哪怕最粗鄙的乡下人都会驻足聆听它的歌声。</p></li>
<li><p>但是，看看它接下来的变化吧。随着光阴流逝，苜蓿草花儿凋谢了，春天渐渐远去，夏天到来。这时，食米鸟不再执着于自己的高雅品位，逐渐褪去诗意的黑色装束，换上了一件黄褐色的粗鄙外套，沉溺于安逸享乐，渐渐沦为普通的恶俗鸟儿。它不再放声歌唱，胃囊里也填满草籽；虽然它不久以前，还在那些随风飘扬的高高野草上摇曳着优美身躯，吟唱出悦耳的歌声。如今它过得很好，已然成为一个饕餮之徒。对它来说，没有任何东西能比过享用美食大餐那样受用。很快，它便厌倦了这些普通的家常菜肴，开始飞向食物更丰富的地方，追求异国风味的美食。</p></li>
<li><p>接下来我们再听到它的时候，它与它的无数同类，正在特拉华州的芦苇丛里举行盛宴，并因为这些美食而日见臃肿。旅途中，它更换了名字，不再是食米鸟，改称芦苇鸟了，并且成为宾夕法尼亚州最受欢迎的小报上的美食家，与其竞争对手蒿雀享有同等恶名！不管它到哪儿，砰！砰！砰！总有生锈的枪筒对准它开火，成千上万只食米鸟不停地倒毙身亡。对此，它是否接受警告，并有所改变？哈，它才不会呢！再一次，它张开翅膀，继续旅行。南方丰美的稻田正等待着它。它狼吞虎咽险乎撑死，体态变得臃肿不堪，甚至无法飞起。它不得不再次更名，变成卡罗莱纳州闻名遐迩的稻米鸟。这里，是它一生中的最后舞台：瞧！它和几十只肥胖的同伴们一起，被穿在烤肉叉上，串成一串，摆上桌，变成南方餐桌上一道为人称道的烘烤大餐。</p></li>
<li><p>这便是食米鸟的故事。它曾经是一只灵魂纯净的、富有音乐气质、令人钦佩的鸟儿，是草地上的快乐精灵，是春天最受喜爱的鸟儿，后来却沦为一个恶俗拥趸，最终在食物柜里为自己曾经的感官享受而得到报应。它的一生，无论是对所有的小鸟还是小男孩们来说，都具有典型的道德意义，警告他们要恪守对高贵品格和聪明才智的追求，远远避开那些恶俗习气和沉迷酒色的倾向。正是对这些美好事物的追求，曾在这只鸟儿年轻时带给它那么高的名气与关注；也正是后来对物欲的沉溺，令这只迷途的鸟儿过早走向毁灭。</p></li>

<h2 id="lesson-41-3">LESSON 41</h2>
<p>REBELLION IN MASSACHUSETTS STATE PRISON</p>
<p>马萨诸塞州州立监狱的叛乱</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A more impressive exhibition of moral courage, opposed to the
wildest ferocity under the most appalling circumstances, was never seen
than that which was witnessed by the officers of our state prison; in
the rebellion which occurred some years since.</p></li>
<li><p>Three convicts had been sentenced, under the rules of the prison,
to be whipped in the yard, and, by some effort of one of the other
prisoners, a door had been opened at midday communicating with the great
dining hall and, through the warden’s [1] lodge, with the
street.</p></li>
<li><p>The dining hall was long, dark, and damp, from its situation near
the surface of the ground; and in this all the prisoners assembled, with
clubs and such other tools as they could seize in passing through the
workshops.</p></li>
<li><p>Knives, hammers, and chisels, with every variety of such weapons,
were in the hands of the ferocious spirits, who are drawn away from
their encroachments [2] on society, forming a congregation of strength,
vileness, and talent that can hardly be equaled on earth, even among the
famed brigands [3] of Italy.</p></li>
<li><p>Men of all ages and characters, guilty of every variety of
infamous crime, dressed in the motley [4] and peculiar garb of the
institution, and displaying the wild and demoniac [5] appearance that
always pertains to imprisoned wretches, were gathered together for the
single purpose of preventing the punishment which was to be inflicted on
the morrow upon their comrades.</p></li>
<li><p>The warden, the surgeon, and some other officers of the prison
were there at the time, and were alarmed at the consequences likely to
ensue from the conflict necessary to restore order. They huddled
together, and could scarcely be said to consult, as the stoutest among
them lost all presence of mind in overwhelming fear. The news rapidly
spread through the town, and a subordinate [6] officer, of the most mild
and kind disposition, hurried to the scene, and came calm and collected
into the midst of the officers. The most equable-tempered and the
mildest man in the government was in this hour of peril the
firmest.</p></li>
<li><p>He instantly dispatched a request to Major Wainright, commander
of the marines [7] stationed at the Navy Yard, for assistance, and
declared his purpose to enter into the hall and try the force of firm
demeanor [8] and persuasion upon the enraged multitude.</p></li>
<li><p>All his brethren exclaimed against an attempt so full of hazard,
but in vain. They offered him arms, a sword and pistols, but he refused
them, and said that he had no fear, and, in case of danger, arms would
do him no service; and alone, with only a little rattan, which was his
usual walking stick, he advanced into the hall to hold parley [9] with
the selected, congregated, and enraged villains of the whole
commonwealth.</p></li>
<li><p>He demanded their purpose in thus coming together with arms, in
violation of the prison laws. They replied that they were determined to
obtain the remission [10] of the punishment of their three comrades. He
said it was impossible; the rules of the prison must be obeyed, and they
must submit.</p></li>
<li><p>At the hint of submission they drew a little nearer together,
prepared their weapons for service, and, as they were dimly seen in the
further end of the hall by those who observed from the gratings that
opened up to the day, a more appalling sight can not be conceived, nor
one of more moral grandeur, than that of the single man standing within
their grasp, and exposed to be torn limb from limb instantly if a word
or look should add to the already intense excitement.</p></li>
<li><p>That excitement, too, was of a most dangerous kind. It broke not
forth in noise and imprecations [11] , but was seen only in the dark
looks and the strained nerves that showed a deep determination. The
officer expostulated [12] . He reminded them of the hopelessness of
escape; that the town was alarmed, and that the government of the prison
would submit to nothing but unconditional surrender. He said that all
those who would go quietly away should be forgiven for this offense; but
that if every prisoner were killed in the contest, power enough would be
obtained to enforce the regulations of the prison.</p></li>
<li><p>They replied that they expected that some would be killed,—that
death would be better than such imprisonment; and, with that look and
tone which bespeak an indomitable [13] purpose, they declared that not a
man should leave the hall alive till the flogging was remitted. At this
period of the discussion their evil passions seemed to be more inflamed,
and one or two offered to destroy the officer, who still stood firmer
and with a more temperate pulse than did his friends, who saw from
above, but could not avert, the danger that threatened him.</p></li>
<li><p>Just at this moment, and in about fifteen minutes from the
commencement of the tumult, the officer saw the feet of the marines, on
whose presence alone he relied for succor, filing by the small upper
lights. Without any apparent anxiety, he had repeatedly turned his
attention to their approach; and now he knew that it was his only time
to escape, before the conflict became, as was expected, one of the most
dark and dreadful in the world.</p></li>
<li><p>He stepped slowly backward, still urging them to depart before
the officers were driven to use the last resort of firearms. When within
three or four feet of the door, it was opened, and closed instantly
again as he sprang through, and was thus unexpectedly restored to his
friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Major Wainright was requested to order his men to fire down upon
the convicts through the little windows, first with powder and then with
ball, till they were willing to retreat; but he took a wiser as well as
a bolder course, relying upon the effect which firm determination would
have upon men so critically situated. He ordered the door to be again
opened, and marched in at the head of twenty or thirty men, who filed
through the passage, and formed at the end of the hall opposite to the
crowd of criminals huddled together at the other.</p></li>
<li><p>He stated that he was empowered to quell the rebellion, that he
wished to avoid shedding blood, but that he would not quit that hall
alive till every convict had returned to his duty. They seemed balancing
the strength of the two parties, and replied that some of them were
ready to die, and only waited for an attack to see which was the more
powerful; swearing that they would fight to the last, unless the
punishment was remitted, for they would not submit to any such
punishment in the prison. Major Wainright ordered his marines to load
their pieces, and, that they might not be suspected of trifling, each
man was made to hold up to view the bullet which he afterward put in his
gun.</p></li>
<li><p>This only caused a growl of determination, and no one blenched
[14] or seemed disposed to shrink from the foremost exposure. They knew
that their number would enable them to bear down and destroy the handful
of marines after the first discharge, and before their pieces could be
reloaded. Again they were ordered to retire; but they answered with more
ferocity than ever. The marines were ordered to take their aim so as to
be sure and kill as many as possible. Their guns were presented, but not
a prisoner stirred, except to grasp more firmly his weapon.</p></li>
<li><p>Still desirous to avoid such a tremendous slaughter as must have
followed the discharge of a single gun, Major Wainright advanced a step
or two, and spoke even more firmly than before, urging them to depart.
Again, and while looking directly into the muzzles of the guns which
they had seen loaded with ball, they declared their intention “to fight
it out.” This intrepid [15] officer then took out his watch, and told
his men to hold their pieces aimed at the convicts, but not to fire till
they had orders; then, turning to the prisoners, he said: “You must
leave this hall; I give you three minutes to decide; if at the end of
that time a man remains, he shall be shot dead.”</p></li>
<li><p>No situation of greater interest than this can be conceived. At
one end of the hall, a fearful multitude of the most desperate and
powerful men in existence, waiting for the assault; at the other, a
little band of disciplined men, waiting with arms presented, and ready,
upon the least motion or sign, to begin the carnage; and their tall and
imposing commander, holding up his watch to count the lapse of three
minutes, given as the reprieve [16] to the lives of hundreds. No poet or
painter can conceive a spectacle of more dark and terrible sublimity; no
human heart can conceive a situation of more appalling
suspense.</p></li>
<li><p>For two minutes not a person nor a muscle moved; not a sound was
heard in the unwonted stillness of the prison, except the labored
breathings of the infuriated wretches, as they began to pant between
fear and revenge: at the expiration of two minutes, during which they
had faced the ministers of death with unblenching eyes, two or three of
those in the rear, and nearest the further entrance, went slowly out; a
few more followed the example, dropping out quietly and deliberately:
and before half of the last minute was gone, every man was struck by the
panic, and crowded for an exit, and the hall was cleared, as if by
magic.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus the steady firmness of moral force and the strong effect of
determination, acting deliberately, awed the most savage men, and
suppressed a scene of carnage, which would have instantly followed the
least precipitancy [17] or exertion of physical force.</p></li>

<p>In one weak heart which braves all adverse fate</p>

<li><p>现在，各种刀锤凿钻，所有能被作为武器的工具，都被这些凶残的暴徒抓在手里，这些罪犯因非法侵犯他人权利而被驱赶到这里；现在，他们组成了一个暴力、邪恶和才智的集合体，这世上几乎不存在可以与之抗衡的势力，甚至包括意大利最为凶残的黑帮。</p></li>
<li><p>这些年龄不同、性格迥异的男囚们，犯下了各种不同的恶劣罪行，穿着监狱里独特的杂色囚服，露出被监禁的囚徒脸上特有狂暴的、魔鬼般的表情。他们聚集在一起，唯一目的是为了阻止明天他们的同伴身上将受到的惩戒。</p></li>
<li><p>典狱长、狱医以及其他部分狱警当时都在场，也都深知如果用暴力手段来恢复秩序将带来什么后果。他们围在一起，很难说是在讨论对策，因为在这种极度恐惧的状态下，即使是他们当中最勇敢的人也都失去了正常的思考能力。监狱暴乱的消息很快传遍了整个小镇，一名性格温和、宅心仁厚而级别较低的警官闻讯后匆忙赶到现场。他冷静自若地走到狱警中间，面对一触即发的危险境地，脾气最温和、平静的人，往往就是最坚定的人。</p></li>
<li><p>他立即派人向韦恩莱特海军少将求助，少将是驻扎在海军基地陆战队的指挥官。随后，他将自己的意图告诉身旁的狱警们：他想走进囚犯餐厅，试着用坚定的态度来劝服这些愤怒的囚犯们。</p></li>
<li><p>他的同僚们无不惊呼起来，对这冒险举动纷纷反对，但都无济于事。他们让他随身带上一柄剑和一支手枪，但他拒绝携带任何武器进去。他对同僚们说，他毫不畏惧；倘若真有危险，这些刀枪根本帮不上忙。于是，他只带着那根平时走路时用的藤杖，孤身一人走进囚犯餐厅，与整个马萨诸塞州恶贯满盈、最为暴虐的这群愤怒的囚徒们进行谈判。</p></li>
<li><p>他要求囚犯们声明自己的目的，为什么他们违反监狱法规，带着武器聚集到一起。囚犯们回答道，他们已下定决心，促使狱方赦免三位同伴。他说，这是不可能的，监狱的法规必须遵守，而囚犯们必须退让。</p></li>
<li><p>当他说到“退让”的时候，囚犯们开始聚拢过来，拿着手里的武器随时准备动手。在餐厅另一头透过天花板上透光的栅栏监视的警官们眼里，没有什么比昏暗中这些囚犯们影影绰绰的脸更令人惊恐的景象了。同样，他们也从没见过比这个单枪匹马站在囚犯们当中的这个人更英勇的形象。似乎只要一言不合，或者眼神不对，囚犯们就会一拥而上将他撕成碎片。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，危机已经一触即发，并没有什么喧闹叫嚷的咒骂声，但是，你能从囚犯们阴沉的表情和爆起的青筋上，看出他们毫不退让的残忍。那名坚定的军官仍在劝诫着囚徒们，他提醒他们逃生无望，整个小镇已经知道了这里的情况；除了无条件投降以外，监狱管理方绝不会屈从囚犯提出的任何条件。他还说，所有安静退出暴乱的囚犯将不会被追究责任；但是，如果有任何一名囚犯在这场冲突中死亡，监狱将获得更多警力支持，以强化监狱中规章制度的执行。</p></li>
<li><p>囚犯们回应说，他们已经预料到冲突中势必会有人员伤亡——但与监禁相比，死亡也许是更好的结局。带着不达目的誓不罢休的眼神和语气，囚犯们扬言，如果狱方不免除对三位囚犯的笞刑，没有人能活着离开餐厅。在谈判期间，囚犯们的邪恶情绪似乎正加剧膨胀爆发，甚至有一两名囚犯提出先解决那位警官。那位警官，只是更坚定地站在那里，比他的同僚们更为冷静温和。他的同僚们只能从天花板栅栏上方看着这一幕，对于他所面临的危险，却束手无策。</p></li>
<li><p>就在那时，距暴乱发生大约十五分钟后，透过天花板上的微弱光线，这名警官看到了海军陆战队员的身影。他知道，自己可以依赖的救援近在眼前。他不动声色，脸上看不出丝毫焦虑，不过密切注意着士兵们愈发逼近的脚步。此刻，他内心明白，这是冲突发生前可以逃脱的唯一良机，也是世上所曾经历过的最为可怕紧张的时刻之一。</p></li>
<li><p>他慢慢地、不动声色地向后挪动，表面上仍强烈要求囚犯们在狱警被迫采用最后武力之前疏散。当离餐厅门还有三四英尺时，他突然飞快地打开门，冲了出去，并迅速关上门。出于所有人意料的，他就这样回到了同僚们当中。</p></li>
<li><p>韦恩莱特少将接到请求，要求责令他的手下士兵通过餐厅的那些窄小窗户迅速向囚犯们开火；先用火药，然后实弹射击，直到囚犯们愿意退却为止。但是，少将却采取了一个更为明智大胆的方案，他决定用坚不可摧的攻心战来击垮这些困兽般的囚犯们。于是，他下令再次打开餐厅大门，领着二三十名士兵列队通过走廊，冲进餐厅，然后在餐厅的另一头列阵排开。士兵们手持武器，对准餐厅这头挤成一堆的罪犯们。</p></li>
<li><p>少将开始向囚徒们喊话，说他奉命前来平息叛乱；他希望能够避免流血伤亡，但是，除非所有囚犯都返回自己的牢房，否则他绝不会让一个人活着离开这个餐厅。囚犯们似乎在衡量双方的力量对比，然后回应道，他们中已有人决心赴死，只有等到士兵们发动攻击，才能看出哪一方力量更强大。他们发誓要血战到最后一个人，直到监狱方愿意解除对那三个囚犯的鞭笞，因为他们绝不愿屈服于鉴于内部的任何此类刑罚。韦恩莱特少将命令手下的海军陆战队员们子弹上膛，同时，为了避免被人怀疑是虚张声势，所有队员都必须将子弹举起来查看，然后再推入枪膛。</p></li>
<li><p>但事与愿违，这样的举动反而激起了囚徒们更激烈的咆哮声。黑压压的囚犯们没有任何人退缩，站在枪口前面，没有人流露出丝毫颤抖的迹象。囚犯们内心清楚，他们的人数足够多；等第一次开枪射击后，士兵们的子弹未及再度上膛，他们就有时间一拥而上，消灭为数不多的士兵。这时，韦恩莱特少将再度命令他们放弃抵抗，但他们的回答却愈见嚣张。少将责令士兵们瞄准敌人，以确保尽可能地射杀对方。士兵们枪支各就各位，但没有一名囚犯心悸惊慌，他们只是将手中的武器握得更牢了。</p></li>
<li><p>少将知道，只要一声枪响，接下来就会是一场大规模的血腥屠杀，他仍然希望避免这种惨剧。因此，韦恩莱特少将又往前跨了一两步，用比以往更加坚定的语气要求囚犯们退却。但囚犯们的回答仍然不变，他们直直地看着装满子弹的枪口，宣称要“杀开一条血路”。这时，这位勇敢的少将拿出自己的手表，吩咐士兵们举枪瞄准，但是在听到命令之前绝不能开枪；接着，他转向那些囚徒说：“你们必须离开这个餐厅，我给你们三分钟时间来决定；三分钟后，凡是还留在这里的人，一律就地枪决。”</p></li>
<li><p>已到了千钧一发的危急关头。大厅两端，囚徒们和士兵们正僵持对峙：一边，是一大群恐怖至极的困兽犹斗等待进攻；另一边，是一小群训练有素的军人，端着枪严阵以待，等待着最后的行动指令或手势迅即展开屠杀。而他们高大勇猛、威风凛凛的指挥官手里拿着他的手表，正在做最后的倒计时，从而决定数百人的生杀予夺。没有笔墨可以描绘出比这幕场景更为黑暗恐怖的生死凝重，没有一个人的心脏能承受比这更骇人听闻的惊险悬念。</p></li>
<li><p>整整两分钟时间，所有人都纹丝不动，监狱里一片少有的寂静，只能听见这些愤怒的囚徒们沉重的呼吸声。在恐惧与复仇纠结中，暴徒们的呼吸越发急促起来。两分钟过去了，刚才这些面对死神毫不退缩的眼神开始动摇，人群队伍后面，临近门口地方，三两人偷偷地退到门外；接着，又有些人效仿他们，悄悄地、格外谨慎地退出门外。最后一分钟的前三十秒结束前，每个囚犯都彻底被恐惧击垮，潮水般地涌向出口，整个大厅刹那间变得空空荡荡，仿佛被施了魔法。</p></li>
<li><p>因此，囿于道德力量的稳健，心理强势的坚韧，谨慎运作的指挥，才最终镇住了那些穷凶极恶的囚犯，从而避免了一场血腥杀戮，哪怕丁点儿轻率鲁莽或武力冲突都会让所有努力前功尽弃。</p></li>

<p>无情寡义的娜莉·格蕾</p>
<p>Thomas Hood (b. 1798, d. 1845) was the son of a London bookseller.
After leaving school he undertook to learn the art of an engraver, but
soon turned his attention to literature. In 1821 he became sub-editor of
the “London Magazine.” Hood is best known as a humorist; but some of his
poems are full of the tenderest pathos; and a gentle, humane spirit
pervades even his lighter productions. He was poor, and during the last
years of his life suffered much from ill health. Some of his most
humorous pieces were written on a sick bed.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ben Battle was a soldier bold,</li>

<p>托马斯·胡德（1798—1845）是一位伦敦书商的儿子。学校毕业后，他最初学习雕刻，但很快就将转向了文学。
1821年，他成为《伦敦杂志》的助理编辑。作为幽默家的托马斯·胡德广为人知，然而，他的诗作充满了一种柔软的悲怆苦楚，这种温柔的人性情怀贯穿于他的短篇作品中。胡德一生窘迫，尤其在生命的最后几年里饱经疾病折腾，他最为著名的一些幽默作品完成于病榻上。</p>

<p>THE GENEROUS RUSSIAN PEASANT</p>
<p>慷慨的俄罗斯农民</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Let Vergil [1] sing the praises of Augustus [2] , genius
celebrate merit, and flattery extol [3] the talents of the great. “The
short and simple annals [4] of the poor” engross [5] my pen; and while I
record the history of Flor Silin’s virtues, though I speak of a poor
peasant, I shall describe a noble man. I ask no eloquence [6] to assist
me in the task; modest worth rejects the aid of ornament to set it
off.</p></li>
<li><p>It is impossible, even at this distant period, to reflect without
horror on the miseries of that year known in Lower Volga [7] by the name
of the “Famine Year.” I remember the summer, whose scorching heats had
dried up all the fields, and the drought [8] had no relief but from the
tears of the ruined farmer.</p></li>
<li><p>I remember the cold, comfortless autumn, and the despairing
rustics, crowding round their empty barns, with folded arms and
sorrowful countenances, pondering on their misery, instead of rejoicing,
as usual, at the golden harvest. I remember the winter which succeeded,
and I reflect with agony on the miseries it brought with it. Whole
families left their homes to become beggars on the highway.</p></li>
<li><p>At night the canopy of heaven served them as their only shelter
from the piercing winds and bitter frost. To describe these scenes would
be to harm the feelings of my readers; therefore, to my tale. In those
days I lived on an estate [9] not far from Simbirsk [10] ; and, though
but a child, I have not forgotten the impression made on my mind by the
general calamity.</p></li>
<li><p>In a village adjoining lived Flor Silin, a poor, laboring
peasant,—a man remarkable for his assiduity and the skill and judgment
with which he cultivated his lands. He was blessed with abundant crops;
and his means being larger than his wants, his granaries [11] , even at
this time, were full of corn. The dry year coming on had beggared all
the village except himself. Here was an opportunity to grow rich. Mark
how Flor Silin acted. Having called the poorest of his neighbors about
him, he addressed them in the following manner:</p></li>
<li><p>“My friends, you want corn for your subsistence [12] . God has
blessed me with abundance. Assist in thrashing out a quantity, and each
of you take what he wants for his family.” The peasants were amazed at
this unexampled generosity; for sordid propensities [13] exist in the
village as well as in the populous city.</p></li>
<li><p>The fame of Flor Silin’s benevolence having reached other
villages, the famished inhabitants presented themselves before him, and
begged for corn. This good creature received them as brothers; and,
while his store remained, afforded all relief. At length, his wife,
seeing no end to the generosity of his noble spirit, reminded him how
necessary it would be to think of their own wants, and hold his lavish
hand before it was too late. “It is written in the Scripture,” said he,
“Give, and it shall be given unto you.”</p></li>
<li><p>The following year Providence listened to the prayers of the
poor, and the harvest was abundant. The peasants who had been saved from
starving by Flor Silin now gathered around him.</p></li>
<li><p>“Behold,” said they, “the corn you lent us. You saved our wives
and children. We should have been famished but for you; may God reward
you; he only can; all we have to give is our corn and grateful thanks.”
“I want no corn at present, my good neighbors,” said he; “my harvest has
exceeded all my expectations; for the rest, thank heaven: I have been
but an humble instrument.”</p></li>
<li><p>They urged him in vain. “No,” said he, “I shall not accept your
corn. If you have superfluities [14] , share them among your poor
neighbors, who, being unable to sow their fields last autumn, are still
in want; let us assist them, my dear friends; the Almighty will bless us
for it.” “Yes,” replied the grateful peasants, “our poor neighbors shall
have this corn. They shall know it is to you that they owe this timely
succor [15] , and join to teach their children the debt of gratitude due
to your benevolent heart.” Silin raised his tearful eyes to heaven. An
angel might have envied him his feelings.</p></li>

<li><p>就让维吉尔去赞美奥古斯都，让天才去赞颂美德，恭维颂扬罗马大帝的圣明与伟绩吧。《贫民简略编年史》一书，耗费我大量的写作时间。当我记录下慷慨好施的菲洛·斯林的一生时，尽管他只是俄罗斯一位穷苦农民，我却是在描述一个品格高尚的人。我无须用花哨雄辩的语言来维系自己的写作，因为谦逊的行为与华美的辞藻并不相容，后者只会抵消前者的价值。</p></li>
<li><p>即使年代相隔久远，回忆起在那个名为“饥荒之年”的年代里，伏尔加河下游民不聊生的悲惨生活，我内心的恐惧依然挥之不去。我还记得灾难发生的那个夏天，烈日烤焦了所有的农田，万物都是干枯的，绝望无助的农民们眼里只有泪水。</p></li>
<li><p>那年秋天，天气寒冷难捱，饥饿的乡民聚集在自家空荡荡的谷仓旁边，抱着手臂，脸上满是悲哀迷惘。他们不再像往年那样，对着金色满仓的粮食庆贺欢歌。我还清楚记得那个接踵而来的寒冬，还能痛苦地想起它给村民们带来的苦难，无数家庭背井离乡，沿街乞讨求生。</p></li>
<li><p>夜晚，饥民们只能在野外露天安歇栖身，没有任何东西可以遮蔽刺骨的寒风和冰冷的霜冻。就我书中记录来看，描述这些悲哀场景只会伤害到读者们的感情。在那些日子里，我住的地方离辛比尔斯克不远；即使我那时还只是个孩子，那些饿殍遍野的悲惨景象仍让我记忆犹新。</p></li>
<li><p>菲洛·斯林，一个住在邻村的贫苦而勤劳的农民，他因自己的勤勉、熟练的技能以及耕种土地的丰富经验而为人所熟知。幸运的是，即使那年灾年，他种下的庄稼也收成良好。因居家耗费有限，因此，即使在那段艰难岁月里，他的粮仓里仍堆满了粮食。饥荒之年迫使全村老少都不得不乞讨度日，唯独他家例外。此时不失为发财暴富的最佳时机。但是，看看菲洛·斯林是怎么做的吧，他召集了最为贫苦的街坊邻居，对他们说出了自己的想法。</p></li>
<li><p>“乡亲们，你们眼下需要粮食才能活下去。上帝保佑，我今年的收成不错。请大家到我家粮仓来，每人都可以领取全家生活必需的口粮。”在场农民们都惊讶于这份史无前例的慷慨。毕竟，就像在人口稠密的城市里一样，农村里也同样存在利欲熏心的现象。</p></li>
<li><p>菲洛·斯林仁慈好施的赈灾善行传到了其他村庄，饥饿的灾民们纷纷来到他门前，乞求周济口粮。这位善良的人像对待兄弟般地接待了他们，倾其所有，将粮仓里囤积的粮食毫不吝啬地分给大家。后来，他的妻子眼见丈夫的慷慨举动毫无尽头，只好提醒他，有必要为自己家人留下口粮，别等到倾家荡产，那时一切都太迟了。然而，菲洛·斯林却坦然说道：“放心吧。《圣经》上说，‘你们要给人，就必有给你们的。’”</p></li>
<li><p>第二年，上帝终于听到了穷人们的祈祷，田里庄稼收成丰足。现在，那些曾被菲洛·斯林救助幸免于难的农民们，再次聚集到他家门口。</p></li>
<li><p>“斯林先生，看哪，”他们说，“这是你曾借给我们的粮食。你拯救了我们的妻儿，要不是你，我们早就成为路边饿殍。愿上帝奖赏你的善行，也只有上帝才能做到。而我们，只能用这些玉米和满心的感谢来报答你。”“善良的乡亲们，我现在不需要粮食，”菲洛·斯林说，“我的收成也远超出我的期望。至于我所做的，感谢天上圣父，我不过是个卑微的践行者。”</p></li>
<li><p>他们再三劝说他接受，终究还是徒劳。“不，”他说，“我不能接受你们的粮食。如果你们手中粮食富余，不如与你们身边的穷苦邻居们分享吧。去年秋天，不少人无法播下种子，现在仍在忍饥挨饿。我们应该去帮助他们，乡亲们，全能的主会因此保佑我们的。”“你说得对，”心怀感激的村民们回答道，“是应该把这些粮食送给那些贫困的乡亲。他们会知道，因为你，他们才能及时获救；在你仁行善举的影响下，他们也会教育孩子学会如何感恩与报答。”听到这样的话，斯林抬起泪眼，望着天堂的方向。他此刻心中满溢的幸福感，就连天使都会为之羡慕。</p></li>

<li>I’ve wandered to the village, Tom,</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve sat beneath the tree,</p>
<p>Upon the schoolhouse playground,</p>
<p>That sheltered you and me;</p>
<p>But none were left to greet me, Tom,</p>
<p>And few were left to know,</p>
<p>Who played with me upon the green,</p>
<p>Just forty years ago.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The grass was just as green, Tom,</li>
</ol>
<p>Barefooted boys at play</p>
<p>Were sporting, just as we did then,</p>
<p>With spirits just as gay.</p>
<p>But the master sleeps upon the hill,</p>
<p>Which, coated o’er with snow,</p>
<p>Afforded us a sliding place,</p>
<p>Some forty years ago.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The old schoolhouse is altered some;</li>
</ol>
<p>The benches are replaced</p>
<p>By new ones very like the same</p>
<p>Our jackknives had defaced.</p>
<p>But the same old bricks are in the wall,</p>
<p>The bell swings to and fro;</p>
<p>Its music’s just the same, dear Tom,</p>
<p>’T was forty years ago.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The spring that bubbled ’neath the hill,</li>
</ol>
<p>Close by the spreading beech,</p>
<p>Is very low; ’t was once so high</p>
<p>That we could almost reach;</p>
<p>And kneeling down to take a drink,</p>
<p>Dear Tom, I started so,</p>
<p>To think how very much I’ve changed</p>
<p>Since forty years ago.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Near by that spring, upon an elm,</li>
</ol>
<p>You know, I cut your name,</p>
<p>Your sweetheart’s just beneath it, Tom;</p>
<p>And you did mine the same.</p>
<p>Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark;</p>
<p>’T was dying sure, but slow,</p>
<p>Just as that one whose name you cut</p>
<p>Died forty years ago.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>My lids have long been dry, Tom,</li>
</ol>
<p>But tears came in my eyes:</p>
<p>I thought of her I loved so well,</p>
<p>Those early broken ties.</p>
<p>I visited the old churchyard,</p>
<p>And took some flowers to strew</p>
<p>Upon the graves of those we loved</p>
<p>Just forty years ago.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Some are in the churchyard laid,</li>
</ol>
<p>Some sleep beneath the sea;</p>
<p>And none are left of our old class</p>
<p>Excepting you and me.</p>
<p>And when our time shall come, Tom,</p>
<p>And we are called to go,</p>
<p>I hope we’ll meet with those we loved</p>
<p>Some forty years ago.</p>

<p>MRS. CAUDLE’S LECTURE</p>
<p>考德尔夫人的演讲</p>
<p>Douglas Jerrold (b. 1803, d. 1857) was born in London. A midshipman’s
appointment was obtained for him, but he quit the naval service in a few
years. He was then apprenticed to a printer. By improving his leisure
hours he made himself master of several languages, and formed the habit
of expressing his thoughts in writing An essay on the opera of Der
Freischutz was his first published literary production. Before he was
twenty-one years of age, he wrote “Black-eyed Susan,” one of the most
popular dramas of modern times. Several other popular plays followed
this. He was a regular contributor to the London “Punch,” from the
second number, and edited, at different times, several papers and
magazines. As a humorist, he occupies the first rank. The most noted of
his works are his plays, and “Mrs Caudle’s Curtain Lectures,” “Saint
Giles and Saint James,” “Bubbles of a Day,” and “Chronicles of
Clovernook.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Well, Mr. Caudle, I hope you’re in a little better temper than
you were this morning. There, you need n’t begin to whistle: people
don’t come to bed to whistle. But it’s like you; I can’t speak that you
don’t try to insult me. Once, I used to say you were the best creature
living: now, you get quite a fiend. Do let you rest? No, I won’t let you
rest. It’s the only time I have to talk to you, and you shall hear me.
I’m put upon all day long: it’s very hard if I can’t speak a word at
night; besides, it is n’t often I open my mouth, goodness
knows!</p></li>
<li><p>Because once in your lifetime your shirt wanted a button, you
must almost swear the roof off the house. You did n’t swear? Ha,
Mr. Caudle! you don’t know what you do when you’re in a passion. You
were not in a passion, wer’n’t you? Well, then, I don’t know what a
passion is; and I think I ought by this time. I’ve lived long enough
with you, Mr. Caudle, to know that.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s a pity you hav’n’t something worse to complain of than a
button off your shirt. If you’d some wives, you would, I know. I’m sure
I’m never without a needle and thread in my hand; what with you and the
children, I’m made a perfect slave of. And what’s my thanks? Why, if
once in your life a button’s off your shirt—what do you cry “oh” at? I
say once, Mr. Caudle; or twice, or three times, at most. I’m sure,
Caudle, no man’s buttons in the world are better looked after than
yours. I only wish I’d kept the shirts you had when you were first
married! I should like to know where were your buttons then?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, it is worth talking of! But that’s how you always try to put
me down. You fly into a rage, and then if I only try to speak, you won’t
hear me. That’s how you men always will have all the talk to yourselves:
a poor woman is n’t allowed to get a word in. A nice notion you have of
a wife, to suppose she’s nothing to think of but her husband’s buttons.
A pretty notion, indeed, you have of marriage. Ha! if poor women only
knew what they had to go through!—what with buttons, and one thing and
another,—they’d never tie themselves up,—no, not to the best man in the
world, I’m sure. What would they do, Mr. Caudle?—Why, do much better
without you, I’m certain.</p></li>
<li><p>And it’s my belief, after all, that the button was n’t off the
shirt; it’s my belief that you pulled it off that you might have
something to talk about. Oh, you’re aggravating [1] enough, when you
like, for anything! All I know is, it’s very odd that the button should
be off the shirt; for I’m sure no woman’s a greater slave to her
husband’s buttons than I am. I only say it’s very odd.</p></li>
<li><p>However, there’s one comfort; it can’t last long. I’m worn to
death with your temper, and sha’n’t trouble you a great while. Ha! you
may laugh! And I dare say you would laugh! I’ve no doubt of it! That’s
your love; that’s your feeling! I know that I’m sinking [2] every day,
though I say nothing about it. And when I’m gone we shall see how your
second wife will look after your buttons! You’ll find out the difference
then. Yes, Caudle, you’ll think of me then; for then, I hope, you’ll
never have a blessed button to your back.</p></li>
<li><p>No, I’m not a vindictive [3] woman, Mr. Caudle: nobody ever
called me that but you. What do you say? Nobody ever knew so much of me?
That’s nothing at all to do with it. Ha! I would n’t have your
aggravating temper, Caudle, for mines of gold. It’s a good thing I’m not
as worrying as you are, or a nice house there’d be between us. I only
wish you’d had a wife that would have talked to you! Then you’d have
known the difference. But you impose upon me because, like a poor fool,
I say nothing. I should be ashamed of myself, Caudle.</p></li>
<li><p>And a pretty example you set as a father! You’ll make your boys
as bad as yourself. Talking as you did all breakfast time about your
buttons! and of a Sunday morning, too! And you call yourself a
Christian! I should like to know what your boys will say of you when
they grow up! And all about a paltry [4] button off one of your
wristbands! A decent man would n’t have mentioned it. Why don’t I hold
my tongue? Because I won’t hold my tongue. I’m to have my peace of mind
destroyed—I ’m to be worried into my grave for a miserable shirt button,
and I’m to hold my tongue! Oh! but that’s just like you men!</p></li>
<li><p>But I know what I’ll do for the future. Every button you have may
drop off, and I won’t so much as put a thread to ’em. And I should like
to know what you’ll do then! Oh, you must get somebody else to sew ’em,
must you? That’s a pretty threat for a husband to hold out to his wife!
And to such a wife as I’ve been, too: such a slave to your buttons, as I
may say. Somebody else to sew ’em’! No, Caudle, no; not while I’m alive!
When I’m dead—and, with what I have to bear, there’s no knowing how soon
that may be—when I ’m dead, I say—oh! what a brute you must be to snore
so!</p></li>
<li><p>You’re not snoring? Ha! that’s what you always say; but that’s
nothing to do with it. You must get somebody else to sew ’em, must you?
Ha! I should n’t wonder. Oh, no! I should be surprised at nothing now!
Nothing at all! It’s what people have always told me it would come to;
and now the buttons have opened my eyes! But the whole world shall know
of your cruelty, Mr. Caudle. After the wife I’ve been to you. Caudle,
you’ve a heart like a hearthstone, you have!</p></li>

<p>道格拉斯·杰罗尔德（1803—1857）出生于英国伦敦，曾被任命为海军见习军官。但几年后，他便从海军退役，然后改行从事印刷。他利用闲暇时间，熟练掌握了数门语言，并形成用文字表达思想的习惯。杰罗尔德出版的第一部文学作品，是关于歌剧《神射手》的评论。在他二十一岁之前，他创作出《黑眼睛的苏珊》，该剧为现代最为流行的戏剧之一。此后，他又接连写出其他几部畅销剧作。从第二期开始，他就是《伦敦喧声》杂志的长期撰稿人，后来又陆续编辑了一些报纸和杂志。作为公认一流的幽默剧作家，他的戏剧作品堪称一流，包括《考德尔夫人枕边训话》、《圣徒贾尔斯和圣徒詹姆斯》、《一天的泡沫》和《克罗夫努克编年史》。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>好了，考德尔先生，但愿你这会儿的脾气比早上要好些。嘿，你不用开始吹口哨嘘我，没有人上了床还吹口哨，不过这倒像是你的作风。你这么做，存心想气我是吧？以前，我总夸你是这世上最好的男人，可现在的你，简直是个恶魔。让你睡觉？你想得倒美，我是不会让你去睡的。我这次非把事情说清楚不可，你给我好好听着。我为你忙碌了一整天，要是连晚上都不能说话，这日子还怎么过得下去！再说了，老天在上，平时我根本就没怎么说过话！</p></li>
<li><p>你这辈子就这么一次衬衫上的纽扣掉了，我没补上，你就非把屋顶都咒骂地翻了天不可。你说什么，没咒骂？哈，考德尔先生！你可不知道当你火冒三丈的时候，你自己都做了些什么。什么，你说你没火冒三丈？啧啧，那我就不知道什么才叫火冒三丈了，可我早就知道了。我跟你一起生活了这么久，考德尔先生，我太明白什么叫火冒三丈。</p></li>
<li><p>除了衬衫上缺了颗纽扣以外，你连其他可抱怨的事情都没有，真够遗憾的，不是吗？要是你有几个老婆，你能抱怨的事情就多了，我说得对吧？要知道，我手上从来不缺针少线，为你或孩子们缝缝补补。我像个奴隶一样努力干活，可你感谢过我吗？你不但没有，甚至当你的衬衫偶尔缺了一颗纽扣的时候，你竟然还叫了一声“唉呀”！考德尔先生，我说过一次，或两次，最多三次：考德尔先生，我敢保证，这世上没有一个男人的衬衫纽扣比你的受到更多的悉心照料。要是我把当年我们结婚时你的衬衫都留着就好了！我倒很想知道，那时你衬衫上的纽扣在哪里？</p></li>
<li><p>对，这事太值得念叨念叨了！可你就是这么习惯打击我。你总是暴跳如雷，一旦我试着开口说话，你就什么都不肯听。你们男人总是自顾自地说个不停，一个可怜的女人根本无从插嘴。在你眼里，一个妻子什么都不用想，只要全心全意地顾着她丈夫的纽扣就行了。这种想法可真不赖！你就是这样看待婚姻的，是不是？哈，要是女人结婚前都知道自己以后要经历些什么就好了！——又是纽扣，又是七扯八拉的琐事。要是女人们知道这些，她们绝不会愿意结婚——绝不会，哪怕是跟这世界上最完美的男人！我敢保证。哦，考德尔先生，你说她们会去做什么？呸，不管做什么，都比跟你在一起强！</p></li>
<li><p>再说了，我觉得，纽扣根本不是自己从衬衫上掉下来的。我相信，一定是你自己把纽扣扯下来，好让你有个由头向我抱怨。天哪，你太令人恼怒了！我只知道，纽扣竟然会自己从衬衫上掉下来，这未免也太奇怪了。就我所知，再没有哪个女人能比我对丈夫的纽扣更尽心尽力，这太离谱了！</p></li>
<li><p>不过，倒有一个好处：这种事不会再发生了。我受够了你的坏脾气，以后真不想再和你过下去了。哈，你竟然在笑！我敢说，你一定笑不拢嘴！对此，我毫不怀疑！这就是你对我的爱，这就是你的心思！这样的生活，我每天都在饱受折磨，可我从来不说什么。等我走了，我倒想看看你的第二任妻子会怎么打理你身上的纽扣！到时候，你就会清楚前后差异了。是的，考德尔，到那时你才会想到我的好处，但愿那时候，你身上没有一粒缝好的纽扣。</p></li>
<li><p>不，考德尔先生，我绝不是个心怀怨恨的女人。除了你，从来没有人这么说我。你说什么？没人像你这么了解我？这跟这一点关系都没有。哈！考德尔，就是给我数座金矿为代价，我也不愿意染上你那种坏脾气。幸亏我不像你那样让人发愁，要不然咱俩早就过不下去了。我只指望你到时候有个总是向你抱怨的老婆！到时候，你就会明白我的好了。你像对待一个可怜的傻子似的对待我，可我什么都没说。我真该为自己感到羞耻，考德尔。</p></li>
<li><p>作为一个父亲，你可真是为孩子们立了个好榜样！儿子们长大后肯定会像你一样举止粗俗。整整一顿早餐时间，你都在喋喋不休大谈你的纽扣，甚至周日早晨也不例外！亏你还自称是基督徒！我真想知道，儿子们长大后会怎么说起你！你絮絮叨叨的都只是你袖口上掉了的一颗微不足道的纽扣！一个斯文的男人根本不会提到它！为什么我不住嘴？因为我不想住嘴！我就是要毁掉自己的平和心态——你指望我为了你一颗衬衫纽扣愁得爬进坟墓，你还想让我住嘴！上帝啊！不过，这还真是你会做的事！</p></li>
<li><p>可是，我知道得为自己将来打算。你身上的每一粒纽扣都有可能掉落，我可没法穿针弄线随时伺候它们。我倒想知道，到时候你该怎么办！哦，我不帮你缝，你就想找其他女人帮你缝，是不是？这还真是丈夫甩给妻子的杀手锏！我一直就是这样的妻子：是你身上纽扣的奴隶！让别人去缝纽扣？不，考德尔，绝不；只要我还活着，你就别指望让别人缝你的纽扣！等我死了——等我死了，那我大概也只能忍受。我这样受你的气，天知道我什么时候会被气死——等我死了，我要说——天哪！你简直是个畜生，你竟然打呼噜打得这么响！</p></li>
<li><p>你没打呼噜？哈！你总是这么说，但所有这些都无所谓了。你一定会找其他女人过日子，对不？哈！我丝毫不感到诧异。不！我现在对任何事情都不会感到诧异了！任何事情！如同别人总是告诉我的那样，该来的，一定会来。直到现在，纽扣才让我看清这些！我应该让全世界都知道你这么残忍地对待我，考德尔先生。作为妻子，我对你这么尽心尽力，考德尔，可你简直就是铁石心肠！</p></li>

<p>THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW</p>
<p>勒克瑙救援</p>
<p>[ From a letter to the “London Times,” by a lady, the wife of an
officer at Lucknow. ]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On every side death stared us in the face; no human skill could
avert [1] it any longer. We saw the moment approach when we must bid
farewell to earth, yet without feeling that unutterable horror which
must have been experienced by the unhappy victims at Cawnpore. We were
resolved rather to die than to yield, and were fully persuaded that in
twenty-four hours all would be over. The engineer [2] had said so, and
all knew the worst. We women strove to encourage each other, and to
perform the light duties which had been assigned to us, such as
conveying orders to the batteries, and supplying the men with
provisions, especially cups of coffee, which we prepared day and
night.</p></li>
<li><p>I had gone out to try to make myself useful, in company with
Jessie Brown, the wife of a corporal in my husband’s regiment. Poor
Jessie had been in a state of restless excitement all through the siege
[3] , and had fallen away visibly within the last few days. A constant
fever consumed her, and her mind wandered occasionally, especially that
day, when the recollections of home seemed powerfully present to her. At
last, overcome with fatigue, she lay down on the ground, wrapped up in
her plaid. I sat beside her, promising to awaken her when, as she said,
her “father should return from the plowing.”</p></li>
<li><p>She fell at length into a profound [4] slumber, motionless and
apparently breathless, her head resting in my lap. I myself could no
longer resist the inclination to sleep, in spite of the continual roar
of the cannon. Suddenly I was aroused by a wild, unearthly scream close
to my ear; my companion stood upright beside me, her arms raised, and
her head bent forward in the attitude of listening.</p></li>
<li><p>A look of intense delight broke over her countenance; she grasped
my hand, drew me toward her, and exclaimed: “Dinna ye hear it? dinna ye
hear it? Ay. I’m no dreaming: it’s the slogan [5] o’ the Highlanders!
We’re saved! we’re saved!” Then flinging herself on her knees, she
thanked God with passionate fervor [6] . I felt utterly bewildered; my
English ears heard only the roar of artillery, and I thought my poor
Jessie was still raving; but she darted to the batteries, and I heard
her cry incessantly to the men, “Courage! courage! Hark to the slogan—to
the Macgregor, the grandest of them a’! Here’s help at last!”</p></li>
<li><p>To describe the effect of these words upon the soldiers would be
impossible. For a moment they ceased firing, and every soul listened
with intense anxiety. Gradually, however, there arose a murmur of bitter
disappointment, and the wailing of the women, who had flocked to the
spot, burst out anew as the colonel shook his head. Our dull Lowland
ears heard only the battle of the musketry. A few moments more of this
deathlike suspense, of this agonizing hope, and Jessie, who had again
sunk on the ground, sprang to her feet, and cried in a voice so clear
and piercing that it was heard along the whole line, “Will ye no believe
it noo? The slogan has ceased, indeed, but the Campbells are comin’! D’
ye hear? d’ ye hear?”</p></li>
<li><p>At that moment all seemed indeed to hear the voice of God in the
distance, when the pibroch [7] of the Highlanders brought us tidings of
deliverance; for now there was no longer any doubt of the fact. That
shrill, penetrating, ceaseless sound, which rose above all other sounds,
could come neither from the advance of the enemy nor from the work of
the sappers [8] . No, it was indeed the blast of the Scottish bagpipes,
now shrill and harsh, as threatening vengeance on the foe, then in
softer tones, seeming to promise succor to their friends in
need.</p></li>
<li><p>Never, surely, was there such a scene as that which followed. Not
a heart in the residency [9] of Lucknow but bowed itself before God.
All, by one simultaneous [10] impulse, fell upon their knees, and
nothing was heard but bursting sobs and the murmured voice of prayer.
Then all arose, and there rang out from a thousand lips a great shout of
joy, which resounded far and wide, and lent new vigor to that blessed
pibroch.</p></li>
<li><p>To our cheer of “God save the Queen,” they replied by the
well-known strain that moves every Scot to tears, “Should auld
acquaintance be forgot.” After that, nothing else made any impression on
me. I scarcely remember what followed. Jessie was presented to the
general on his entrance into the fort, and at the officers’ banquet her
health was drunk by all present, while the pipers marched around the
table playing once more the familiar air of “Auld Lang Syne.”</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>死神潜伏在四周，紧紧盯着我们的脸。再没有什么办法可以逃脱它的魔掌。我们每个人都知道，与这个世界做最后告别的时刻近了，所幸的是，坎恩坡那些不幸的罹难者所遭遇到的无法言说的恐怖，我们并没有感受到。我们已经下定决心，宁可受难赴死，也不愿投降，甚至完全相信，不过区区二十四小时之内，一切都将尘埃落定。那位随军工程师也是这么说的，当然，我们也都清楚眼下这最糟糕的情况。妇女们彼此拼命鼓劲，完成分配给我们的那些较轻的活儿，譬如向前方街垒炮手传达命令，为大家分发生活补给品，咖啡尤其必不可少，为此，我们从早到晚忙碌不停。</p></li>
<li><p>我走出家门，和杰西·布朗一起，四处看看我们能否帮上什么忙，她是我丈夫同一军团里一位下士的妻子。在被围攻的这段时间里，可怜的杰西一直焦躁不安。才几天时间，她已经明显消瘦了，一直在发烧，精神恍惚。尤其是那天，思乡的情绪强烈攫取了她，在过度疲劳中，她坚持不住了，躺在地上，裹着她的格子呢毛毯。我坐在她身旁，答应在“她父亲从地里回来的时候”唤醒她。</p></li>
<li><p>她慢慢陷入沉睡，一动不动，似乎连呼吸也已经停止了，她的头还枕在我的大腿上。尽管身边炮火轰鸣，我自己也感到难以克制地昏昏欲睡。猛然，一声疯狂怪异的尖叫声刺入我的耳膜，杰西竟笔直地站起，立在我身边，高举着双臂，侧着头，像是在聆听着些什么。</p></li>
<li><p>她的脸上突然露出难以克制的狂喜。她紧紧抓住我的手，用力将我拉向她，一边尖声高叫：“迪娜，你听到了吗？你听到了吗？天哪，我不是在做梦：这是苏格兰士兵们的呐喊！我们得救了！我们得救了！”她突然扑通跪倒在地，感谢上帝的仁慈，情绪那么亢奋激昂。我被她的举动弄迷糊了，我的耳朵里只听见炮声的滚滚轰鸣，我想，可怜的杰西大概是烧糊涂了，但她飞一般地冲到街垒边，冲着那些荷枪实弹的士兵们不停地高喊道：“挺住！挺住！你们快听这呐喊声，这是麦格雷戈将军的军队！最骁勇善战的军队！我们的救兵终于来了！”</p></li>
<li><p>实在难以形容这些话对士兵们的影响。有那么一会儿工夫，他们停止了射击，每一个人都在焦虑万分地侧耳倾听。然而，渐渐地，人群中响起苦涩失望的窃窃私语。上校摇了摇头，那些哀声哭泣的妇女们，刚才因杰西的喊声而聚拢，又爆发出一阵号啕大哭。我们只听见持续的枪炮声。在这死一般的寂静中，在这折磨人的希望中，杰西又颓然倒地，双脚挺直，突然又跳起来，大声尖叫着：“难道没有人相信我吗？呐喊声是停止了，但号角声吹响了！你们听到了吗？听到了吗？”她的声音如此清晰尖锐，在整条街道上回响。</p></li>
<li><p>苏格兰风笛号角声从远处传来拯救的信息，那一瞬间，所有人仿佛都听到了上帝的声音。现在，这个事实已经毋庸置疑。那高昂的充满穿透力的声音延绵不断地传来，盖过了所有其他声音，那声音绝不是来自进攻的敌人，或我军前方的战壕。不，这确实是响亮的苏格兰风笛号角声，声音高亢而粗犷，似乎宣泄着对敌人复仇的呐喊；接着，号角声又略微柔和，宛若表达拯救患难战友传达胜利的允诺。</p></li>
<li><p>眼前未曾出现过的一幕就这样发生了。勒克瑙战区无人不被上帝的奇迹所折服。所有人心里怀着同样的强烈情绪，扑通跪倒在地，哭泣着，哽咽着，喃喃祷告着。然后，大家站起身来，上千人同时爆发出震耳欲聋的欢呼声，回荡着响彻远方，为那福音般的风笛声注入了崭新活力。</p></li>
<li><p>我们高唱起《上帝保佑女王》。为回应我们的欢乐，援军奏响了那首极富盛名的让每个苏格兰人掉泪的乐曲——《友谊地久天长》。接下来的事情似乎淡忘了，我实在记不清后面发生了什么。杰西被隆重地介绍给走进要塞的将军，在官方举办的宴会上，在场的所有军官都为她的健康干杯。与此同时，风笛手们围绕着餐桌行进奏乐，《友谊地久天长》再一次在风中嘹亮奏响。</p></li>

<p>James Thomson (b. 1700, d.1748) was born at Ednam, in the shire of
Roxburgh, Scotland. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and
afterwards studied for the ministry, but in a short time changed his
plans and devoted himself to literature. His early poems are quite
insignificant, but “The Seasons,” from which the following selection is
taken and the “Castle of Indolence,” are masterpieces of English
poetry.</p>

<li><p>A railroad train was rushing along at almost lightning speed. A
curve was just ahead, beyond which was a station where two trains
usually met. The conductor was late,—so late that the period during
which the up train was to wait had nearly elapsed; but he hoped yet to
pass the curve safely. Suddenly a locomotive dashed into sight right
ahead. In an instant there was a collision [1] . A shriek, a shock, and
fifty souls were in eternity; and all because an engineer had been
behind time.</p></li>
<li><p>A great battle was going on. Column after column had been
precipitated [2] for eight hours on the enemy posted along the ridge of
a hill. The summer sun was sinking in the west; reenforcements [3] for
the obstinate defenders were already in sight; it was necessary to carry
the position with one final charge, or everything would be
lost.</p></li>
<li><p>A powerful corps [4] had been summoned from across the country,
and if it came up in season all would yet be well. The great conqueror,
confident in its arrival, formed his reserve [5] into an attacking
column, and ordered them to charge the enemy. The whole world knows the
result. Grouchy failed to appear; the imperial guard was beaten back;
and Waterloo was lost. Napoleon died a prisoner at St. Helena because
one of his marshals was behind time.</p></li>
<li><p>A leading firm in commercial circles had long struggled against
bankruptcy [6] . As it had large sums of money in California, it
expected remittances [7] by a certain day, and if they arrived, its
credit, its honor, and its future prosperity would be preserved. But
week after week elapsed without bringing the gold. At last came the
fatal day on which the firm had bills maturing [8] to large amounts. The
steamer was telegraphed at daybreak; but it was found, on inquiry, that
she brought no funds, and the house failed. The next arrival brought
nearly half a million to the insolvents, but it was too late; they were
ruined because their agent, in remitting, had been behind time.</p></li>
<li><p>A condemned man was led, out for execution. He had taken human
life, but under circumstances of the greatest provocation [9] , and
public sympathy was active in his behalf. Thousands had signed petitions
for a reprieve; a favorable answer had been expected the night before,
and though it had not come, even the sheriff felt confident that it
would yet arrive. Thus the morning passed without the appearance of the
messenger.</p></li>
<li><p>The last moment was up. The prisoner took his place, the cap was
drawn over his eyes, the bolt was drawn, and a lifeless body swung
revolving in the wind. Just at that moment a horseman came into sight,
galloping down hill, his steed covered with foam. He carried a packet in
his right hand, which he waved frantically to the crowd. He was the
express rider with the reprieve; but he came too late. A comparatively
innocent man had died an ignominious [10] death because a watch had been
five minutes too late, making its bearer arrive behind time.</p></li>
<li><p>It is continually so in life. The best laid plans, the most
important affairs, the fortunes of individuals, the weal [11] of
nations, honor, happiness, life itself, are daily sacrificed, because
somebody is “behind time.” There are men who always fail in whatever
they undertake, simply because they are “behind time.” There are others
who put off reformation year after year, till death seizes them, and
they perish unrepentant, because forever “behind time.”</p></li>

<li><p>一场激烈的战役正在进行。长达八个小时，一列列纵队被指挥着向山脊上的敌人发起进攻。夏日骄阳已经渐渐西沉，远方顽固敌军增援部队的身影已经进入视野。发动最后一次进攻事不宜迟，否则，一切都将前功尽弃。</p></li>
<li><p>已经从全国各地召集起一支精锐部队。如果这支部队能及时抵达，战事局面将大为改观。这位伟大的征服者相信它能及时到达，因此，他把自己身边最后的近卫队悉数投入战场，指挥他们向敌人发动攻击。全世界对最终结果一目了然：格鲁希元帅没有出现，拿破仑的近卫军被彻底击败，滑铁卢丢失。就因为他手下那位元帅的迟到，拿破仑最终死于圣·赫勒拿监狱。</p></li>

<li><p>一名死刑犯即将被执行死刑。他虽然杀了人，却是因为受到被害者的挑衅而冲动犯的罪，因此，公众对他都给予了相当同情。数千人签署了请愿书，请求对他判处缓刑。同意缓刑的答复大概在前一天晚上就已经被批下了，虽然批复未到，但就连死刑执行官也相信，它一定会在死刑执行前及时送达。然而，第二天早上，仍看不到信使的身影。</p></li>
<li><p>执行死刑的最后时刻终于来临。死刑犯被带上眼罩，脖子套上绳索，站到预定位置。他脚下的木板突然打开，尸体就这样在风中摇摆旋转。就在那一刻，一位骑马者进入人们的视线，马匹飞奔下山，马嘴边吐着泡沫。骑士的右手上拿着一个小包裹，发狂地朝人群挥舞着。他正是携带缓刑命令的传令者，但是，他来得太迟了。就因为传令者的表慢了五分钟，他迟到了，一个不应该被判处死刑的人就这样被可耻地夺去了生命。</p></li>
<li><p>生活中，有太多这样的例子。那些最佳设定计划、重大或关键事件、个人命运、国家前途、荣誉、幸福乃至生活本身，都因为某个人的“迟到”而被耽误。有些人，不管他们做什么，失败总是与之形影不离，就因为他们总是“走在时间后面”。还有些人，年复一年地推迟改变，直到死神将他们带入坟墓。因为“走在时间后面”，他们冥顽不化地死去，再也没有机会做出改变。</p></li>

<p>THE GOODNESS OF GOD</p>
<p>上帝的仁爱</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Bless the Lord, O my soul! O Lord, my God, thou art very great;
thou art clothed with honor and majesty: who coverest thyself with light
as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; who
layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds
his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind; who maketh his
angels spirits, his ministers a flaming fire; who laid the foundations
of the earth, that it should not be removed forever.</p></li>
<li><p>Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
stood above the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy
thunder they hasted away. They go up by the mountains; they go down by
the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded [1] for them. Thou
hast set a bound which they may not pass over; that they turn not again
to cover the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
hills. They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses
quench their thirst. By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their
habitation [2] , which sing among the branches. He watereth the hills
from his chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy
works.</p></li>
<li><p>He caused the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
service of man, that he may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine
that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine,
and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.</p></li>
<li><p>The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
which he hath planted, where the birds make their nests: as for the
stork, the fir trees are her house. The high hills are a refuge [3] for
the wild goats, and the rocks for the conies [4] .</p></li>
<li><p>He appointed [5] the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going
down. Thou makest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of
the forest do creep forth. The young lions roar after their prey, and
seek their meat from God. The sun ariseth, they gather themselves
together, and lay them down in their dens. Man goeth forth unto his
work, and to his labor until the evening.</p></li>
<li><p>O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them
all: the earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide sea,
wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play
therein. These wait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat
in due season.</p></li>
<li><p>That thou givest them they gather; thou openest thine hand, they
are filled with good. Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou
takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou
sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face
of the earth.</p></li>
<li><p>The glory of the Lord shall endure forever: the Lord shall
rejoice in his works. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he
toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</p></li>
<li><p>O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men! And let them sacrifice the
sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with
rejoicing.</p></li>
<li><p>O give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name; make known his
deeds among the people. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of
all his wondrous works. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them
rejoice that seek the Lord. Seek the Lord, and his strength; seek his
face evermore.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; his wonders, and
the judgments of his mouth. He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in
all the earth. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will sing
praise to my God while I have my being.</p></li>

<li><p>我的心哪，你要称颂耶和华！耶和华，我的神啊，你为至大。你以尊荣威严为衣服，披上亮光，如披外袍，铺张苍穹，如铺幔子，在水中立楼阁的栋梁，用云彩为车辇，借着风的翅膀而行。以风为使者，以火焰为仆役，将地立在根基上，使地永不动摇。</p></li>
<li><p>你用深水遮盖地面，犹如衣裳，诸水高过山岭。你的斥责一发，水便奔逃；你的雷声一发，水便奔流。诸山升上，诸谷沉下（或作“随山上翻，随谷下流”），归你为它所安定之地。你定了界限，使水不能过去，不再转回遮盖地面。</p></li>
<li><p>耶和华使泉源涌入山谷，流在山间。使野地的走兽有水喝，野驴得解其渴。天上的飞鸟在水旁住宿，在树枝上啼叫。他从楼阁中浇灌山岭，因他作为的功效，地就丰足。</p></li>
<li><p>他使草生长，给六畜吃，使菜蔬发长，供给人用，使人从地里能得食物。又得酒能悦人心，得油能润人面，得粮能养人心。</p></li>
<li><p>佳美的树木，就是黎巴嫩的香柏树，是耶和华所栽种的，都满了汁浆。雀鸟在其上搭窝。至于鹤，松树是它的房屋。高山为野山羊的住所，岩石为沙番的藏处。</p></li>
<li><p>你安置月亮为定节令；日头自知沉落。你造黑暗为夜，林中的百兽就都爬出来。少壮狮子吼叫，要抓食，向神寻求食物。日头一出，兽便躲避，卧在洞里。人出去做工，劳碌直到晚上。</p></li>
<li><p>耶和华啊，你所造的何其多，都是你用智慧造成的：遍地满了你的丰富。那里有海，又大又广。其中有无数的动物，大小活物都有。那里有船行走，有你所造的鳄鱼游泳在其中。这都仰望你按时给它们食物。</p></li>
<li><p>你给它们，它们便拾起来；你张手，它们饱得美食。你掩面，它们便惊惶。你收回它们的气，它们就死亡，归于尘土。你发出你的灵，它们便受造。你使地面更换为新。</p></li>
<li><p>愿耶和华的荣耀存到永远；愿耶和华喜悦自己所造的。他看地，地便震动。他摸山，山就冒烟。</p></li>
<li><p>但愿人因耶和华的慈爱，和他向人所行的奇事都称赞他！愿他们以感谢为祭献给他，欢呼述说他的作为。</p></li>
<li><p>你们要称谢耶和华，求告他的名，在万民中传扬他的作为。要向他唱诗歌颂，谈论他一切奇妙的作为。要以他的圣名夸耀，寻求耶和华的人，心中应当欢喜。要寻求耶和华与他的能力，时常寻求他的面。</p></li>
<li><p>他仆人亚伯拉罕的后裔，他所拣选雅各的子孙哪，你们要记念他奇妙的作为和他的奇事，并他口中的判语。他是耶和华我们的神，全地都有他的判断。我要一生向耶和华唱诗，我还活着的时候，要向我神歌颂。</p></li>

<p>Felicia Dorothea Hemans (b. 1794, d. 1835) was born in Liverpool,
England. Her maiden name was Browne. Her childhood was spent in Wales.
Her first volume of poems was published in 1808; her second in 1812. In
1812 she was married to Captain Hemans, but he left her about six years
after their marriage, and they never again lived together. She went,
with her five sons, to reside with her mother, then living near
St. Asaph, in North Wales. Mrs. Hemans then resumed her literary
pursuits, and wrote much and well. Her poetry is smooth and graceful,
and she excels in description. Many of her poems are exceedingly
beautiful.</p>

<p>THE WILL</p>
<p>遗 嘱</p>
<p>Characters.—SWIPES, a brewer; CURRIE, a saddler; FRANK MILLINGTON;
and</p>
<p>SQUIRE DRAWL.</p>
<p>Swipes . A sober occasion, this, brother Currie. Who would have
thought the old lady was so near her end?</p>
<p>Currie . Ah! we must all die, brother Swipes; and those who live the
longest outlive the most.</p>
<p>Swipes . True, true; but, since we must die and leave our earthly
possessions, it is well that the law takes such good care of us. Had the
old lady her senses when she departed?</p>
<p>Cur . Perfectly, perfectly. Squire Drawl told me she read every word
of the will aloud, and never signed her name better.</p>
<p>Swipes . Had you any hint from the Squire what disposition [1] she
made of her property?</p>
<p>Cur . Not a whisper; the Squire is as close as an underground tomb;
but one of the witnesses hinted to me that she had cut off her graceless
[2] nephew, Frank, without a shilling.</p>
<p>Swipes . Has she, good soul, has she? You know I come in, then, in
right of my wife.</p>
<p>Cur . And I in my own right; and this is no doubt the reason why we
have been called to hear the reading of the will. Squire Drawl knows how
things should be done, though he is as air-tight as one of your beer
barrels. But here comes the young reprobate [3] . He must be present, as
a matter of course, you know. [Enter FRANK MILLINGTON.] Your servant,
young gentleman. So your benefactress has left you at last.</p>
<p>Swipes . It is a painful thing to part with old and good friends,
Mr. Millington.</p>
<p>Frank . It is so, sir; but I could bear her loss better had I not so
often been ungrateful for her kindness. She was my only friend, and I
knew not her value.</p>
<p>Cur . It is too late to repent, Master Millington. You will now have
a chance to earn your own bread.</p>
<p>Swipes . Ay, ay, by the sweat of your brow, as better people are
obliged to. You would make a fine brewer’s boy, if you were not too
old.</p>
<p>Cur . Ay, or a saddler’s lackey [4] , if held with a tight rein.</p>
<p>Frank . Gentlemen, your remarks imply that my aunt has treated me as
I deserved. I am above your insults, and only hope you will bear your
fortune as modestly as I shall mine submissively. I shall retire.
[Going: He meets SQUIRE DRAWL.]</p>
<p>Squire . Stop, stop, young man. We must have your presence. Good
morning, gentlemen; you are early on the ground.</p>
<p>Cur . I hope the Squire is well today.</p>
<p>Squire . Pretty comfortable, for an invalid.</p>
<p>Swipes . I trust the damp air has not affected your lungs again.</p>
<p>Squire . No, I believe not. But, since the heirs at law are all
convened [5] , I shall now proceed to open the last will and testament
of your deceased [6] relative, according to law.</p>
<p>Swipes . [While the SQUIRE is breaking the seal,] It is a trying
thing to leave all one’s possessions, Squire; in this manner.</p>
<p>Cur . It really makes me feel melancholy when I look around and see
everything but the venerable owner of these goods. Well did the Preacher
say, “All is vanity.”</p>
<p>Squire . Please to be seated, gentlemen. [He puts on his spectacles
and begins to read slowly.] “Imprimis [7] ; whereas, my nephew, Francis
Millington, by his disobedience and ungrateful conduct, has shown
himself unworthy of my bounty, and incapable of managing my large
estate, I do hereby give and bequeath all my houses, farms, stocks,
bonds, moneys, and property, both personal and real, to my dear cousins,
Samuel Swipes, of Malt Street, brewer, and Christopher Currie, of Fly
Court, saddler.” [The SQUIRE here takes off his spectacles, and begins
to wipe them very leisurely.]</p>
<p>Swipes . Generous creature! kind soul! I always loved her!</p>
<p>Cur . She was good, she was kind;—and, brother Swipes, when we
divide, I think I’ll take the mansion house.</p>
<p>Swipes . Not so fast, if you please, Mr. Currie. My wife has long had
her eye upon that, and must have it.</p>
<p>Cur . There will be two words to that bargain, Mr. Swipes. And,
besides, I ought to have the first choice. Did I not lend her a new
chaise [8] every time she wished to ride? And who knows what
influence—</p>
<p>Swipes . Am I not named first in her will? and did I not furnish her
with my best small beer for more than six months? And who knows—</p>
<p>Frank . Gentlemen, I must leave you. [Going.]</p>
<p>Squire . [Putting on his spectacles very deliberately.] Pray,
gentlemen, keep your seats, I have not done yet. Let me see; where was
I? Ay, “All my property, both personal and real, to my dear cousins,
Samuel Swipes, of Malt Street, brewer,”—</p>
<p>Swipes . Yes!</p>
<p>Squire . “And Christopher Currie, of Fly Court, saddler,”</p>
<p>Cur . Yes!</p>
<p>Squire . “To have and to hold, IN TRUST, for the sole and exclusive
benefit of my nephew, Francis Millington, until he shall have attained
the age of twenty-one years, by which time I hope he will have so far
reformed [9] his evil habits, as that he may safely be intrusted with
the large fortune which I hereby bequeath to him.”</p>
<p>Swipes . What is all this? You don’t mean that we are humbugged? In
trust!</p>
<p>How does that appear? Where is it?</p>
<p>Squire . There; in two words of as good old English as I ever
penned.</p>
<p>Cur . Pretty well, too, Mr. Squire, if we must be sent for to be made
a laughingstock of. She shall pay for every ride she has had out of my
chaise, I promise you.</p>
<p>Swipes . And for every drop of my beer. Fine times, if two sober,
hard-working citizens are to be brought here to be made the sport of a
graceless profligate [10] . But we will manage his property for him,
Mr. Currie; we will make him feel that trustees are not to be trifled
with.</p>
<p>Cur . That we will.</p>
<p>Squire . Not so fast, gentlemen; for the instrument [11] is dated
three years ago; and the young gentleman must be already of age, and
able to take care of himself. Is it not so, Francis?</p>
<p>Frank . It is, your worship.</p>
<p>Squire . Then, gentlemen, having attended to the breaking of the
seal, according to law, you are released from any further trouble about
the business.</p>

<p>（人物：史怀博，酿酒商；库里，马具商；弗兰克·米林顿，以及德洛尔 [12]
法官。）</p>
<p>史怀博：这可真是个严肃的场合，是吧，库里兄弟。谁能想到老太太这么快就走了？</p>
<p>库里：哈！人人免不了一死，兄弟。谁能活得比别人时间更长，就是最大的成就了。</p>
<p>史怀博：这倒是。既然人都是要死的，也都要留下世俗财产，法律还能这么眷顾我们，这可真不错。那老太太临走的时候，意识清醒吗？</p>
<p>库里：相当清醒。德洛尔法官告诉我，当时她一字一句地大声读出自己的遗嘱，签名时，她从未把自己名字写得那么顺溜。</p>
<p>史怀博：她是怎么处置遗产的，你从法官那里听到什么风声了吗？</p>
<p>库里：一点风声都没有。那法官口风紧得像埋在地底的坟墓。但当时在场的见证人对我透露，老太太剥夺了弗兰克的遗产继承权，就是她那个粗俗的侄子，愣是一个子儿都没给他留下。</p>
<p>史怀博：真的？太好了，她真的这么做了？你知道，我是代表我妻子的权利而来的。</p>
<p>库里：我可是代表自己。毫无疑问，这一定就是我们被叫来听法官宣读遗嘱的原因。尽管德洛尔法官嘴紧得像是你酒窖里的酒桶，密不透风，但是对于该怎么办事，他可再清楚不过了。瞧，那小无赖也来了。从道理上说，他必须在场，你懂的。（弗兰克·米林顿上）年轻的先生，向您致敬，您的监护人最终还是离您而去了。</p>
<p>史怀博：与故交知己分别，实在是件让人难受的事，米林顿先生。</p>
<p>弗兰克：正是如此，先生。如果我那时不是一而再、再而三地对她的好意不屑一顾的话，也许我现在会更好受些。她是我唯一的亲人，我却没认清她对我的价值。</p>
<p>库里：想悔改已经太晚了，米林顿少爷。从今儿起，你得自己赚钱养活自己了。</p>
<p>史怀博：就是，就是，就像那些比您更体面的绅士们那样，您也该学着花力气工作了。您要是比现在再年轻几岁，没准还能学学酿酒。</p>
<p>库里：是啊，或是做个马具店的学徒也不错，如果曾被严加管教过的话。</p>
<p>弗兰克：先生们，你们在暗示我婶婶在遗嘱中对我的态度，真是我咎由自取。你们还不够资格来羞辱我，只希望，你们能谦恭地对待你们的财富，正如我对待自己的那样。抱歉，我得告辞了。（弗兰克正欲离开，德洛尔法官走进。）</p>
<p>法官：等等，年轻人，我们需要你在场。早上好，先生们，你们来得可真够早的。</p>
<p>库里：但愿法官大人今天身体不错。</p>
<p>法官：作为一位病弱老人，我今天确实感觉不错。</p>
<p>史怀博：我相信这潮湿的空气不会再度影响到您的肺部吧？</p>
<p>法官：不会，我感觉很好。既然法律上的所有继承人都已经到场，依据法律，我现在要打开你们死去亲属生前最后一份遗嘱。</p>
<p>史怀博：（法官正在打开文件上的封蜡）用这种方式留下一个人的所有遗产，真令人难受，是吧，法官大人。</p>
<p>库里：当我环顾四周，看到所有东西都保持原状，只是不见曾经的主人，真令我感到心酸。牧师说得好，“凡事皆虚空。”</p>
<p>法官：请入座，先生们。（他带上眼镜，开始慢慢朗读起来。）“首先，鉴于我的侄子，弗朗西斯·米林顿忤逆不孝和忘恩负义的行为，已充分表明他不配获得我的恩惠，也没有能力管理我的大宗房产，因此，我愿将我所有的房产、农场、股票、债券、现金以及其他财产，包括动产和不动产，遗留给我亲爱的表兄弟们：麦芽街酿酒商塞缪尔·史怀博以及粉煤灰场马具商克里斯托夫·库里。”（法官读到这里，摘下他的眼镜，开始从容不迫地擦拭眼镜。）</p>
<p>史怀博：多么慷慨大度的人啊！善良的灵魂！我一直那么敬重她！</p>
<p>库里：她真是个好人，心地多么善良——对了，史怀博兄弟，待会儿我们平分财产的时候，我可要拿走这栋大房子。</p>
<p>史怀博：别这么快做决定，库里先生。我妻子早就眼巴巴地盯着这栋房子了，她可一定得把它要到手。</p>
<p>库里：史怀博先生，那我们可就有得争了。不过，我可得有优先选择权。老太太生前想坐的马车，哪次我不是腾出一辆新的？有谁知道——</p>
<p>史怀博：在她遗嘱里，难道不是把我的名字放在前面吗？难道不是我为她提供自家最好的淡啤酒，而且一送就是半年多？有谁知道——</p>
<p>弗兰克：先生们，我该走了。（正欲离开。）</p>
<p>法官：（非常刻意地重新戴上眼镜。）安静点，先生们，请坐下。我还没念完呢。让我看看，刚才我念到哪里？哦，在这儿。“我所有的财产，包括动产和不动产，都遗留给我亲爱的表兄弟们：麦芽街塞缪尔·史怀博……”</p>
<p>史怀博：是我！</p>
<p>法官：“以及粉煤灰场马具商克里斯托夫·库里……”</p>
<p>库里：是我！</p>
<p>法官：“出于为我侄子弗朗西斯·米林顿单独且排他性继承我的财产的目的，令上述两人持有这些财产的托管义务，直到他年满二十一岁。我希望，届时他已能改掉自己身上的恶习，并能妥善管理好我在此遗赠给他的所有财产。”</p>
<p>史怀博：这是什么意思？您该不会是说，我们都被骗了吧？托管！“托管”这个词是怎么出现的？这个词在哪儿？</p>
<p>法官：在这儿。这两个漂亮的古英语单词，是我亲笔写下的。</p>
<p>库里：好吧，法官先生，如果我们必须被当成笑柄的话，我告诉你，那她就得为每次乘坐我的马车支付费用。</p>
<p>史怀博：还有我的每一滴啤酒！要是两个清醒的勤劳工作的好市民反倒被叫到这里，被一个忘恩负义的浪荡子耻笑，那我们就得好好算算这笔账！但是，我们会好好帮他管理这笔财产的。我们会让他知道，受托人可不是好惹的。对吧，库里先生。</p>
<p>库里：说的对，我们一定会的。</p>
<p>法官：别着急，先生们。这份遗嘱的签字日期是三年前，上面写明这位年轻的绅士必须满二十一岁，而且必须有能力照顾好自己。你现在是否满足这两个条件，弗朗西斯？</p>
<p>弗兰克：是的，法官大人。</p>
<p>法官：那么，先生们，鉴于你们已经目睹了遗嘱解封，依据法律，你们与这笔遗产的相关权利义务已被解除。</p>

<p>THE NOSE AND THE EYES</p>
<p>鼻子与眼睛</p>
<p>William Cowper (b. 1731, d. 1800) was the son of an English
clergyman, and was born in Great Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire, England.
He was sent to Westminster School when he was ten years of age, and he
remained there, a diligent student, eight years. He then studied law,
and was admitted to the bar, but he never practiced his profession. He
was appointed to a clerkship in the House of Lords when he was about
thirty years old, but he never entered upon the discharge of his duties.
He became insane, and was sent to a private asylum. After his recovery,
he found a home in the family of the Rev. Mr. Unwin. On the death of
this gentleman, he resided with the widow till her death—most of the
time at Olney. His first writing’s were published in 1782. “The Task,”
some hymns, a number of minor poems, and his translations of Homer,
composed his published works. His insanity returned at times, and
darkened a pure and gentle life at its close.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose;</li>
</ol>
<p>The spectacles set them, unhappily, wrong;</p>
<p>The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,</p>
<p>To which the said spectacles ought to belong.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>So Tongue was the lawyer, and argued [1] the cause,</li>
</ol>
<p>With a great deal of skill and a wig full of learning,</p>
<p>While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws,</p>
<p>So famed for his talent in nicely discerning [2] .</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“In behalf [3] of the Nose, it will quickly appear,</li>
</ol>
<p>And your lordship,” he said, “will undoubtedly find,</p>
<p>That the Nose has the spectacles always to wear,</p>
<p>Which amounts to possession, time out of mind.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Then, holding the spectacles up to the court,</li>
</ol>
<p>“Your lordship observes, they are made with a straddle</p>
<p>As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,</p>
<p>Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>“Again, would your lordship a moment suppose</li>
</ol>
<p>(’T is a case that has happened, and may happen again)</p>
<p>That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,</p>
<p>Pray, who would or who could wear spectacles then?</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>“On the whole it appears, and my argument shows,</li>
</ol>
<p>With a reasoning the court will never condemn,</p>
<p>That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,</p>
<p>And the Nose was as plainly intended for them.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Then shifting his side (as a lawyer knows how),</li>
</ol>
<p>He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes:</p>
<p>But what were his arguments, few people know,</p>
<p>For the court did not think them equally wise.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>So his lordship decreed [4] , with a grave, solemn tone,</li>
</ol>
<p>Decisive and clear, without one if or but,</p>
<p>That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on,</p>
<p>By daylight or candlelight,—Eyes should be shut.</p>

<p>威廉·考伯（1731—1800）是一名英国牧师的儿子，出生于英国赫特福德郡的大伯克汉姆斯戴德。十岁时，他便被送到威斯敏斯特学校学习，在校八年学习刻苦。随后，考伯攻读法律，获得律师资格，但他从未以律师身份执业。大约三十岁时，考伯被任命为上议院书记，但也从未履行过这一职责。他精神失常后，被送往一个私人收容所。精神状态恢复后，他开始栖身于厄文牧师家。厄文牧师去世后，他与牧师的遗孀一起居住在奥尔尼，直到她去世。
1782年，考伯出版了第一部作品《任务》，里面包括一些赞美诗、一些短小诗歌以及他翻译的荷马诗歌。考伯是个纯净、温柔的人，但是，精神失常仍时常困扰他，给他的晚年生活蒙上了阴影。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>鼻子与眼睛之间发生了一场奇怪的争执，</li>
</ol>
<p>夹在中间的眼镜，是引发争论的祸首。</p>
<p>争执焦点，现在已经世人皆知：</p>
<p>眼镜，究竟应该属于哪一方？</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>舌头是鼻子的律师，满腹经纶，口舌如簧，</li>

<p>“向阁下陈述理由。您将毫无疑问地发现，</p>
<p>眼镜一直佩戴在鼻子上，</p>
<p>时间久远，已构成事实上的占有。”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>它将眼镜作为证物，呈上法庭，</li>
</ol>
<p>“阁下请看，眼镜中间有一道横梁，</p>
<p>宽度与鼻子一样。换句话说，这个设计</p>
<p>正是为了能让眼镜安在鼻子上，像个马鞍。</p>

</ol>
<p>（这样的情况曾发生过，以后也还可能发生。）</p>

<li>“鉴于庭上不曾反驳我的推论，</li>

<p>AN ICEBERG</p>
<p>冰 山</p>
<p>Louis Legrand Noble (b. 1813, d. 1882) was born in Otsego County, New
York. When twelve years of age, he removed with his family to the wilds
of Michigan, but after the death of his father he returned to New York
to study for the ministry, which he entered in 1840. About this time he
published his first productions, two Indian romances in the form of
poems, entitled “Pewatem” and “Nimahmin.” Mr. Noble lived for a time in
North Carolina, and later at Catskill on the Hudson, where he became a
warm friend of the artist Cole. After the latter’s death he wrote a
memorial of him. Other works of this author are “The Hours, and other
Poems,” and “After Icebergs with a Painter,” from which this selection
is taken.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We have just passed a fragment of some one of the surrounding
icebergs that had amused us. It bore the resemblance of a huge polar
bear, reposing upon the base of an inverted cone [1] , with a twist of a
seashell, and whirling slowly round and round. The ever-attending green
water, with its aerial clearness, enabled us to see its spiral folds and
horns as they hung suspended in the deep.</p></li>
<li><p>The bear, a ten-foot mass in tolerable proportion, seemed to be
regularly beset by a pack of hungry little swells [2] . First, one would
take him on the haunch, then whip back into the sea over his tail and
between his legs. Presently a bolder swell would rise and pitch into his
back with a ferocity that threatened instant destruction. It only washed
his satin fleece the whiter.</p></li>
<li><p>While Bruin was turning to look the daring assailant in the face,
the rogue had pitched himself back into his cave. No sooner that, than a
very bulldog of a billow would attack him in the face. The serenity [3]
with which the impertinent assault was borne was complete. It was but a
puff of silvery dust, powdering his mane with fresher brightness.
Nothing would be left of bull but a little froth of all the foam
displayed in the fierce onset. He too would turn and scud into his
hiding place.</p></li>
<li><p>Persistent little waves! After a dash, singly, all around, upon
the common enemy, as if by some silent agreement underwater, they would
all rush on at once, with their loudest roar and shaggiest foam, and
overwhelm poor bear so completely that nothing less might be expected
than to behold him broken in four quarters, and floating helplessly
asunder. Mistaken spectators! Although, by his momentary rolling and
plunging, he was evidently aroused, yet neither Bruin nor his burrow was
at all the worse for all the wear and washing.</p></li>
<li><p>The deep fluting, the wrinkled folds, and cavities, over and
through which the green and silvery water rushed back into the sea,
rivaled the most exquisite [4] sculpture [5] . And nature not only gives
her marbles, with the finest lines, the most perfect lights and shades,
she colors them also. She is no monochromist [6] , but polychroic [7] ,
imparting such touches of dove tints, emerald, and azure as she bestows
upon her gems and skies.</p></li>
<li><p>We are bearing up under the big berg as closely as we dare. To
our delight, what we have been wishing and watching for is actually
taking place: loud explosions, with heavy falls of ice, followed by the
cataract-like roar, and the high, thin seas, wheeling away beautifully
crested with sparkling foam. If it is possible, imagine the effect upon
the beholder: this precipice of ice, with tremendous cracking, is
falling toward us with a majestic and awful motion.</p></li>
<li><p>Down sinks the long water line into the black deep; down go the
porcelain crags and galleries of glassy sculpture—a speechless and awful
baptism. Now it pauses, and returns: up rise sculptures and crags
streaming with the shining white brine; up comes the great encircling
line, followed by things new and strange—crags, niches, balconies, and
caves; up, up, it rises, higher and higher still, crossing the very
breast of the grand ice, and all bathed with rivulets of gleaming foam.
Over goes the summit, ridge, pinnacles [8] , and all, standing off
obliquely [9] in the opposite air. Now it pauses in its upward roll:
back it comes again, cracking, cracking, cracking, “groaning out harsh
thunder” as it comes, and threatening to burst, like a mighty bomb, into
millions of glittering fragments. The spectacle is terrific and
magnificent. Emotion is irrepressible [10] , and peals of wild hurrah
burst forth from all.</p></li>

<p>路易斯·罗格朗·诺伯（1813—1882）出生于美国纽约州奥齐戈县。十二岁时，他随家迁居到密歇根州的荒野地区。父亲去世后，他又回到了纽约研习宗教，并于1840年成为一名神职人员。几乎与此同时，诺伯出版了他的第一部诗作，两篇以诗歌形式叙述的印度罗曼史，题名为《珀瓦蒂姆》和《尼玛敏》。诺伯一度在北卡罗莱纳州居住，后来搬到纽约哈德逊河畔的卡兹奇尔，并在那里成为了艺术家科尔的密友。好友去世后，诺伯为他写了一篇悼文。他的其他作品包括《时间与其他诗歌》和《与一位画家探寻冰山》，本文便节选自后者。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>围绕在四周的冰山群令我们惊异。我们刚刚经过其中一块冰山碎块，它看起来像一头巨大的北极熊，静静地趴在一个倒立的圆锥体底部休息，贝壳般不停地扭动躯体慢慢旋转。清澈透绿的海水映照出天空的澄净透明，我们能看见冰山螺旋状的褶皱和棱角悬浮于深海当中。</p></li>
<li><p>这块北极熊状的冰山，是一座高达十英尺的庞然大物，它似乎已经习惯于被身边这些饥渴的小浪潮们所包围。瞧，一个浪潮扑咬着它的腰臀，然后扫过它的尾巴和腿间，又回到海里；转眼间，另一个更大的浪潮升起，凶残地撕咬着它的后背，似乎很快就要将它完全破坏，却只是令它柔滑如白色绸缎的毛皮被洗刷得更加亮丽。</p></li>
<li><p>当北极熊转过身想当面看看这个大胆的攻击者时，这个小混蛋已经回到海里，躲进它的洞穴里。还没等大熊回过神来，一阵像牛头犬一般的浪潮迎面扑在它的脸上。很快，发出这粗鲁攻击的海面又恢复宁静，只留下一堆银色粉尘，将大熊的鬃毛装点得更为鲜亮。在这场激烈的攻击中，大熊毫发无损，只是身上多了些泡沫。接着，它又旋转过身子，潜进它的藏身之处。</p></li>
<li><p>这些顽固的小浪潮们！随着一道撞击，这些小浪潮们似乎在海水深处达成了某种秘不可宣的协议，从四面八方同时冲击着这个共同的敌人。它们一拥而上，咆哮着，带着无数细碎的泡沫，将这只可怜的大熊彻底压在水下。我们几乎敢肯定，这次大熊一定会被裂成数块，它的冰块肢体将无助地漂浮在海面上。哈，我们这些旁观者都错了！尽管它被冲击得天旋地转，暂时被淹没海里，并被击打得彻底清醒，但是，不管是大熊还是它的巢穴，都毫无损伤，只是被洗涤得更加干净。</p></li>
<li><p>绿色银亮的海水，沿着冰山上深深的沟槽、细微的褶皱和腔洞冲回海里。这座奇异的冰山块，几乎能与世上最精美的雕塑竞相媲美。然而，大自然绝不仅仅在她的大理石上刻下最优美的线条，幻化出最完美的光影，她还为它上了色。是的，大自然绝不是位单色画家，而是一位彩色画家。她在冰山上勾抹出浅灰、翡翠绿、湛蓝的色调，正如她赋予她的宝石与天空一般。</p></li>
<li><p>我们尽可能大胆地从下风处靠近这座高大的冰山。让我们欣喜的是，我们一直期望看到的一幕终于发生了：伴随着巨大的爆炸声，这块冰山崩裂成无数碎块，沉重地坠落下来，发出一阵瀑布般的轰鸣声。从高空拍击下来的海水，带着一层稀薄的水雾，在海面上卷出一顶泡沫的冠冕。如果可能的话，不妨想想旁观者的内心震撼：这座冰山悬崖，随着巨大的裂纹，眼看着气势恢弘地向我们迎面倒下。</p></li>
<li><p>这些优美的冰的线条就这样倒进黢黑的大海里，瓷玉般的峭壁和琉璃冰雕的碎片纷纷坠落——这是一场无言的、可怕的洗礼。终于，它停了下来；但是，很快它又回来了：在粼粼炫目的海水中，庞大无比的冰川轮廓再度升起，随即喷涌而出一些新奇有趣的雕塑，有峭壁、壁龛、阳台和洞穴。它上升着，上升着，越来越高，与四周壮阔的冰山群纵横相交，通体沐浴在闪亮的泡沫溪流里。山峰升上来了，接着是山脊、山肩，最后是整座冰山，出现在我们的斜下方处。现在，它已经不再旋转着上升；原先的那一幕又出现了：它开始发出开裂的声音，开裂，开裂，“像刺耳的雷声一般吱嘎作响”。它似乎又快崩裂了，像一枚威力无比的炸弹，将炸成不计其数的闪亮碎片。多么宏伟壮观的景象啊！我们无法抑制情感，忍不住迸发出一阵响亮的欢呼声。</p></li>

<p>ABOUT QUAIL</p>
<p>鹌 鹑</p>
<p>William Post Hawes (b. 1803, d.1842) was born in New York City. and
was a graduate of Columbia College. He was a lawyer by profession. His
writings consist mainly of essays, contributed to various newspapers and
magazines, and show great descriptive power. He was a frequent
contributor to the “Spirit of the Times,” under the title of “Cypress,
Jr.,” on various sporting topics. After his death a collection of his
writings was published in two volumes, entitled, “Sporting Scenes” and
“Sundry Sketches.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The quail is peculiarly a domestic bird, and is attached to his
birthplace and the home of his forefathers. The various members of the
aquatic [1] families educate their children in the cool summer of the
far north, and bathe their warm bosoms in July in the iced waters of
Hudson Bay; but when Boreas [2] scatters the rushes where they had
builded their bedchambers, they desert their fatherland, and fly to
disport in the sunny waters of the south.</p></li>

insects and berries are cut off in the fall, gather themselves to renew
their loves and get married in more genial climes. Presently, the groves
so vocal [3] , and the sky so full, shall be silent and barren. The
“melancholy days” will soon be here; only thou, dear Bob White [4] ,
wilt remain.</p></li>
<li><p>The quail is the bird for me. He is no rover, no emigrant. He
stays at home, and is identified [5] with the soil. Where the farmer
works, he lives, and loves, and whistles. In budding springtime, and in
scorching summer—in bounteous autumn, and in barren winter, his voice is
heard from the same bushy hedge fence, and from his customary cedars.
Cupidity [6] and cruelty may drive him to the woods, and to seek more
quiet seats; but be merciful and kind to him, and he will visit your
barnyard, and sing for you upon the boughs of the apple tree by your
gateway.</p></li>
<li><p>When warm May first wooes the young flowers to open and receive
her breath, then begin the cares and responsibilitie of wedded life.
Away fly the happy pair to seek some grassy tussock [7] , where, safe
from the eye of the hawk and the nose of the fox, they may rear their
expectant brood in peace.</p></li>
<li><p>Oats harvest arrives, and the fields are waving with yellow
grain. Now be wary, O kind-hearted cradler [8] , and tread not into
those pure white eggs ready to burst with life! Soon there is a peeping
sound heard, and lo! a proud mother walketh magnificently in the midst
of her children, scratching and picking, and teaching them how to
swallow. Happy she, if she may be permitted to bring them up to
maturity, and uncompelled to renew her joys in another nest.</p></li>
<li><p>The assiduities of a mother have a beauty and a sacredness about
them that command respect and reverence in all animal nature, human or
inhuman—what a lie does that word carry—except, perhaps, in monsters,
insects, and fish. I never yet heard of the parental tenderness of a
trout, eating up his little baby, nor of the filial gratitude of a
spider, nipping the life out of his gray-headed father, and usurping [9]
his web.</p></li>
<li><p>But if you would see the purest, the sincerest, the most
affecting [10] piety of a parent’s love, startle a young family of
quails, and watch the conduct of the mother. She will not leave you. No,
not she. But she will fall at your feet, uttering a noise which none but
a distressed mother can make, and she will run, and flutter, and seem to
try to be caught, and cheat your outstretched hand, and affect to be
wing-broken and wounded, and yet have just strength to tumble along,
until she has drawn you, fatigued, a safe distance from her threatened
children and the young hopes of her heart; and then will she mount,
whirring with glad strength, and away through the maze of trees you have
not seen before, like a close-shot bullet, fly to her skulking
infants,</p></li>
<li><p>Listen now. Do you hear those three half-plaintive notes, quickly
and clearly poured out? She is calling the boys and girls together. She
sings not now “Bob White!” nor “Ah! Bob White!” That is her husband’s
love call, or his trumpet blast of defiance. But she calls sweetly and
softly for her lost children. Hear them “Peep! peep! peep!” at the
welcome voice of their mother’s love! They are coming together. Soon the
whole family will meet again.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a foul sin to disturb them; but retread your devious [11]
way, and let her hear your coming footsteps, breaking down the briers,
as you renew the danger. She is quiet. Not a word is passed between the
fearful fugitives. Now, if you have the heart to do it, lie low, keep
still, and imitate the call of the hen quail. O mother! mother! how your
heart would die if you could witness the deception! The little ones
raise up their trembling heads, and catch comfort and imagined safety
from the sound. “Peep! peep!” They come to you, straining their little
eyes, and, clustering together and answering, seem to say, “Where is
she? Mother! mother! we are here!”</p></li>

<li><p>鹌鹑是一种独特的居家型鸟类，总是依恋它的出生地以及它祖先的出生地。各种栖水而生的鸟类总是在遥远北方的凉爽夏季里养育幼鸟，到了七月炎夏，便飞到哈德逊湾的冰水里消暑；但是，当北风之神卷走了它们用来筑巢的枝叶，它们便离开自己的故乡，飞到南方温暖的水湄地带过冬。</p></li>
<li><p>那些树林间的音乐家，通常以昆虫和莓果为生。秋天，当它们的食物供应不足，它们便飞到气候更温暖适宜的地方，展开新的爱恋，重新求偶交配。于是，那曾经啁啾不停的树林，曾经飞满了鸟儿的天空，变得沉默而贫瘠。阴郁的日子即将来临，只有你，亲爱的鲍勃·怀特，依然留在这里。</p></li>
<li><p>鹌鹑正是我喜欢的那种鸟。它并不流浪，也不迁徙，它只是留在家里，与同一片土地相伴相依。它在这块农民劳作的地方成长，恋爱，玩耍。无论是在万物萌芽的春天，还是在骄阳似火的夏季，在丰收富饶的秋天，还是寒冷贫瘠的冬日，你总能在那块灌木丛生的篱笆栅栏里，或是它常待的杉木下，听到它的鸣叫声。它们也许会被贪婪残忍的人类驱赶到树林里，只能寻求更为偏僻的地方；但是，如果你善良友好地对待它，它便会来探访你的谷仓，栖息在你家院子里苹果树的树枝上，为你尽情歌唱。</p></li>
<li><p>当五月明媚的阳光惹得许多鲜花竞相开放，空气中一片芬芳，鹌鹑们新婚生活的操劳与责任便随之而来。这对幸福的小两口会飞到一处茂密的草丛中，远离苍鹰锐利的眼睛，避开狐狸灵敏的鼻子，在那里安心地孕育雏鸟。</p></li>
<li><p>燕麦收获的季节到了，田野里翻腾着金色的麦浪。现在，要小心了！善良的喜爱孩子的人们啊，小心别踩到那些纯净洁白的鹌鹑蛋，那些即将破壳而出的生命！很快，你便能听到小鹌鹑们啾啾的声音，瞧！一只骄傲的母亲，正自豪地走在她的孩子们中间，时而为它们抓挠啄理，教它们如何吞咽食物。如果她能将幼雏们养育长大，而不是因雏鸟早死令她被迫重新孵窝的话，她该是多么幸福啊！</p></li>
</ol>
<p>6.母性的勤勉散发着美丽与神圣的光芒，值得被尊重和崇敬。这样的母性，体现在自然界的所有生物中，无论是人类或非人类——“非人类”
[12]
，这是个多么可笑的词啊！也许，除了怪物、昆虫和鱼类以外。我从未听说过散发着母性的温柔鳟鱼会吃掉自己的卵，也从未听说过感恩孝顺的蜘蛛会咬死自己垂老的父母，从而篡夺它们的蛛网。</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>但是，如果你想看到最纯洁、最真诚、最虔诚的母爱，那就去惊吓年轻的鹌鹑一家吧，然后，观察鹌鹑母亲的所作所为。她不会丢下子女逃之夭夭，不，绝不会！但她会假装倒在你的脚下，发出惊人的鸣叫声，这样的声音除了一位痛苦母亲以外，再没有其他生物能发出。她还会跑开，扑动着翅膀，似乎在诱惑着你去抓她；当她骗得你伸出手，她便假装折断了翅膀，受了伤，却倾尽全力一路滚爬，直到你累得筋疲力尽，你才发现：原来你离她受到危险的孩子们已经这么远了。那些雏鸟们，才是她生命的希望。直到这时，她才呼啦啦飞起，翅膀扇起喜悦的风，就像一颗近距离射出的子弹一样，一头飞进那些你不曾知晓的树林深处，飞向她潜藏雏鸟的地方。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，快听！你听到那三声焦急不已、急速清晰的声音吗？那是她在呼唤儿女们聚拢一起。她不是鸣啾“鲍勃·怀特”或“啊！鲍勃·怀特”，这是她丈夫在求偶时或愤怒时发出的声音，她只是温柔甜蜜地呼唤着自己走失的孩子们。你听，雏鸟们“唧！唧！唧”叫个不停，回应着母亲充满爱意的呼唤！全家聚在一起，终于，它们重新团圆了。</p></li>
<li><p>去惊扰这些鹌鹑，是一件可怕的罪恶。但是，你现在又踏上这条邪恶之路，让它听到你走近的脚步声，踩断沿路的荆棘，让这个鹌鹑家庭又重新处于危险之中。母鹌鹑只是一声不吭地倾听着。这群心里充满恐惧的逃亡者之间，没有任何言语交流。现在，如果你真如此邪恶，低低蹲下，一动不动，然后模仿母鹌鹑的叫声。天哪！天哪！要是母鹌鹑亲眼目睹这样的欺骗，她的心大概都会碎了！小鹌鹑们会抬起它们颤抖的小脑袋，从这一呼唤声中寻求温暖和想象中的安全。“唧！唧！唧！”它们会走向你，竭力张开它们的小眼睛，簇拥在一起，叫唤着，似乎在说：“她在哪里？妈妈！妈妈！我们在这里！”</p></li>

<p>THE MACHINIST’S RETURN</p>
<p>回家之路</p>
<p>[ Adapted from a letter written by a correspondent of the Washington
“Capital.” ]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On our way from Springfield to Boston, a stout, black-whiskered
man sat immediately in front of me, in the drawing-room car, whose
maneuvers [1] were a source of constant amusement. He would get up every
five minutes, hurry away to the narrow passage leading to the door of
the car, and commence laughing in the most violent manner, continuing
that healthful exercise until he observed that some one was watching
him, when he would return to his seat.</p></li>
<li><p>As we neared Boston these demonstrations [2] increased in
frequency and violence, but the stranger kept his seat and chuckled to
himself. He shifted the position of his two portmanteaus [3] , or placed
them on the seat as if he was getting ready to leave. As we were at
least twenty-five miles from Boston, such early preparations seemed
extremely ridiculous. He became so excited at last that he could not
keep his secret. Some one must be made a confidant [4] ; and as I
happened to be the nearest to him, he selected me.</p></li>
<li><p>Turning around suddenly, and rocking himself to and fro in his
chair, he said, “I have been away from home three years. Have been in
Europe. My folks don’t expect me for three months yet, but I got through
and started. I telegraphed them at the last station—they’ve got the
dispatch [5] by this time.” As he said this he rubbed his hands, and
changed the portmanteau on his left to the right, and then the one on
the right to the left.</p></li>
<li><p>“Have you a wife?” said I. “Yes, and three children,” was the
answer. He then got up and folded his overcoat anew, and hung it over
the back of the seat. “You are somewhat nervous just now, are you not?”
said I.</p></li>
<li><p>“Well, I should think so,” he replied. “I have n’t slept soundly
for a week. Do you know,” he went on, speaking in a low tone, “I am
almost certain this train will run off the track and break my neck
before I get to Boston. I have had too much good luck lately for one
man. It can’t last. It rains so hard, sometimes, that you think it’s
never going to stop; then it shines so bright you think it’s always
going to shine; and just as you are settled in either belief, you are
knocked over by a change, to show you that you know nothing about
it.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Well, according to your philosophy [6] ,” I said, “you will
continue to have sunshine because you are expecting a storm.” “Perhaps
so,” he replied; “but it is curious that the only thing which makes me
think I shall get through safe is, I fear that I shall not.”</p></li>
<li><p>“I am a machinist [7] ,” he continued; “I made a discovery;
nobody believed in it; I spent all my money in trying to bring it out; I
mortgaged [8] my home—everything went. Everybody laughed at me—everybody
but my wife. She said she would work her fingers off before I should
give it up. I went to England. At first I met with no encouragement
whatever, and came very near jumping off London Bridge. I went into a
workshop to earn money enough to come home with: there I met the man I
wanted. To make a long story short, I’ve brought home 50000 Pounds with
me, and here I am.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Good!” I exclaimed. “Yes,” said he, “and the best of it is, she
knows nothing about it. She has been disappointed so often that I
concluded I would not write to her about my unexpected good luck. When I
got my money, though, I started for home at once.”</p></li>
<li><p>“And now, I suppose, you will make her happy?” “Happy!” he
replied; “why, you don’t know anything about it! She’s worked night and
day since I have been in England, trying to support herself and the
children decently. They paid her thirteen cents apiece for making
shirts, and that’s the way she has lived half the time. She’ll come down
to the depot to meet me in a gingham [9] dress and a shawl a hundred
years old, and she’ll think she’s dressed up! Perhaps she won’t have any
fine dresses in a week or so, eh?”</p></li>
<li><p>The stranger then strode down the passageway again, and getting
in a corner where he seemed to suppose that he was out of sight, went
through the strangest pantomime [10] ,—laughing putting his mouth into
the drollest shapes, and swinging himself back and forth in the limited
space.</p></li>
<li><p>As the train was going into the depot, I placed myself on the
platform of the car in front of the one in which I had been riding, and
opposite the stranger, who, with a portmanteau in each hand, was
standing on the lowest step, ready to jump to the ground. I looked from
his face to the faces of the people before us, but saw no sign of
recognition. Suddenly he cried, “There they are!”</p></li>
<li><p>Then he laughed outright, but in a hysterical [11] way, as he
looked over the crowd in front of him. I followed his eye and saw, some
distance back, as if crowded out by the well-dressed and elbowing
throng, a little woman in a faded dress and a well-worn hat, with a face
almost painful in its intense but hopeful expression, glancing rapidly
from window to window as the coaches passed by.</p></li>
<li><p>She had not seen the stranger, but a moment after she caught his
eye. In another instant he had jumped to the platform with his two
portmanteaus, and, pushing his way through the crowd, he rushed towards
the place where she was standing. I think I never saw a face assume so
many different expressions in so short a time as did that of the little
woman while her husband was on his way to meet her.</p></li>
<li><p>She was not pretty,—on the contrary, she was very plain-looking;
but somehow I felt a big lump rise in my throat as I watched her. She
was trying to laugh, but, God bless her, how completely she failed in
the attempt! Her mouth got into the position to laugh, but it never
moved after that, save to draw down at the corners and quiver, while her
eyes blinked so fast that I suspect she only caught occasional glimpses
of the broad-shouldered fellow who elbowed his way so rapidly toward
her.</p></li>
<li><p>As he drew close, and dropped the portmanteaus, she turned to one
side, and covered her face with her hands; and thus she was when the
strong man gathered her up in his arms as if she were a child, and held
her sobbing to his breast.</p></li>
<li><p>There were enough staring at them, heaven knows; so I turned my
eyes away a moment, and then I saw two boys in threadbare roundabouts
standing near, wiping their eyes on their sleeves, and bursting into
tears anew at every fresh demonstration on the part of their mother.
When I looked at the stranger again he had his hat drawn over his eyes;
but his wife was looking up at him, and it seemed as if the pent-up
tears of those weary months of waiting were streaming through her
eyelids.</p></li>

<p>（改编自一封给华盛顿《首都报》的读者来信。）</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>我们坐在一辆从斯普林菲尔德开往波士顿火车的硬座车厢里，一位结实壮硕、胡须拉碴的男人恰好坐在我前面，他的表情动作不停地引起车厢中旅客的笑声。每过五分钟，他就会站起来，冲到通往列车门的狭窄过道上，然后无法抑制地开怀大笑，直到察觉到有人正看着他，他才会停止这种健康练习，返回座位上。</p></li>
<li><p>火车离波士顿越近，他的这些举动也越发频繁而猛烈，就连回到座位上的时候，这个陌生男人也忍不住一个人呵呵傻笑。他不停挪动自己的两个旅行箱，或是干脆将它们放到座位上，似乎他马上就要下车。当时，火车离波士顿至少还有二十五英里，这么早就准备下车，未免太过滑稽。最后，他愈发激动，无法再隐藏心中的秘密。必须有个人倾听他的故事，而我碰巧坐得离他最近，理所当然成了他情感宣泄的知己。</p></li>
<li><p>他突然转过身，在自己的座位上前后摇晃着身体，对我说：“我离家已经三年了，一直待在欧洲。我离家前，我的家人都以为我最多会在那儿待三个月，但我坚持下来了。在上一个站台上，我给他们发了电报——现在，他们大概已经收到了。”他一边说，一边搓着手，一会儿动手将左边的皮箱放到右边，又将右边的挪到左边。</p></li>
<li><p>“你有妻子吗？”我问道。“有，还有三个孩子。”他回答。他站起身来，重新折叠起他的大衣，把它搭在椅背上。“你有点紧张，对吧？”我问道。</p></li>
<li><p>“是的，我想是的。”他回答说，“这一个星期来我都没怎么睡好觉。你知道吗，”他压低了声音，继续说，“我几乎可以肯定，在我到达波士顿之前，这列火车一定会脱轨，摔断我的脖子。这段时间，我的运气实在太好了，没有人运气能这么好。这样的好运气不可能长久，你知道，有时候雨下得太大时，你觉得这大雨再也不不会停了；然后，雨停了，阳光灿烂，你也会想天总会这样一如既往地晴下去。就在你坚守着自己信念的时候，事情往往就会发生变化，将你打垮，好让你知道，世事无常，你又是多么渺小。”</p></li>
<li><p>“既然这样，根据你的推理，”我说，“那你的生活就会继续阳光灿烂，因为你正在期待一场风暴。”“也许是吧，”他说，“这听起来大概很奇怪，但是，唯一让我觉得我有可能安全抵达的心态是：我害怕自己无法安全到达。”</p></li>
<li><p>“我是一名机械师，”他继续说道，“我曾有过一项重大发现，但没有人相信它。我花光了家里所有的钱，试图将这一发现公布于众，我将自己的房子做了抵押——所有财产都没了。每个人都嘲笑我——每个人，除了我的妻子。她说，她会拼命挣钱养家，不到最后一刻，我都不应该放弃。于是，我去了英国。刚开始，事情没有任何转机，我绝望得几乎要从伦敦桥上跳下去。后来，我去了一家工厂工作，赚足能带回家的钱，就在那里，我遇见了希望见到的人。长话短说，我这次带了五万英镑回家，喏，情况就是这样。”</p></li>
<li><p>“太好了！”我叫了起来。“是的，”他说，“最好的部分是，我妻子对此一无所知。我曾无数次令她失望，所以，这次我决定不告诉她我撞了好运。尽管这样，我一拿到钱，就决定立马回家。”</p></li>
<li><p>“我想，现在，你能让她幸福吧？”“幸福！”他说，“天哪，你什么都不知道！自从我去了英国，她昼夜不停地干活，试图养活孩子们和她自己。她每做出一件衬衫只能拿到十三美分的报酬，这就是她上半辈子的生活！她待会儿会到车站来接我，穿一件粗布衣衫，戴条怕有百年光景的的破围巾，而她觉得这就已经是精心打扮了！或许一周左右，她可能都没有其他的好衣服穿了。懂吗？”</p></li>
<li><p>这个陌生人再次大步流星地走到过道上，走到一个他大概以为没人会发现的角落里，又开始表演奇怪的哑剧——他大笑着，嘴巴扭成各种各样可笑的造型，他的身体在狭窄的空间里前后摇晃不停。</p></li>
<li><p>当火车进站后，我下了车，站在这节车厢前面的站台上。在我前面，那名陌生人一手拎一个皮箱，站在车门的最下一层台阶上，正打算跳到月台上。我的目光从他的脸庞移到我们前面人群的脸上，一切安然正常。他冷不丁地高喊：“他们在那里！”</p></li>
<li><p>逡巡着前方人群，他不禁大声笑了出来，笑得几乎有点歇斯底里。我顺着他的视线，看到稍远的地方，站着一个穿着褪色裙子，戴着破旧帽子的娇小女人，被衣着体面的人群推搡着挤到外围，那张在紧张与渴望交集中几乎痛苦变形的脸，急切地张望着那一节节驶过的车厢。</p></li>
<li><p>她还没看见这个陌生人，但是，很快他们便双目对视。他立马拎着自己的两个皮箱跳下车，拼命挤开拥挤的人群，朝她站立的地方跑去。当那个丈夫冲她跑过去的瞬间，那个小女人脸上闪现出的各种复杂难言的表情，是我这辈子从未见到过的。</p></li>
<li><p>她长得并不漂亮——恰恰相反，她的姿色实在庸常；但不知道为什么，当我看着她的时候，我的胸口哽咽异常。她似乎想笑，但是，上帝保佑她，她勉强挤出的笑容彻底失败了！她的嘴角上扬到本该微笑的地方，但竟僵在那里，后来反而垂下来，颤抖着；她的眼睛眨得很厉害，我怀疑人潮汹涌中她只能偶尔看清那个熟悉的身影，那个有着宽阔肩膀的男人正用手肘拼命撞开人群，飞快地向她跑去。</p></li>
<li><p>当他跑到跟前，丢下手里的行李箱，她扭过身子，用双手捂住自己的脸，那个强壮的男人一把将她搂在怀里，她就像一个孩子，伏在他的胸膛上失声痛哭。</p></li>
<li><p>天知道，我盯着他们看了多久。于是，我将视线离开了片刻，随后看到两个衣衫褴褛的男孩站在附近的环状交叉路口边，用衣袖擦拭着眼睛，每当他们的母亲有什么新的举动，男孩们又会再次泪流满面。当我再次看向这个陌生人，我发现，他已将帽檐拉下遮住眼睛，而他的妻子正仰脸望着他，那些漫长等待的岁月里压抑已久的泪水，正沿着她的脸颊潸然而下。</p></li>

<p>James Montgomery (b. 1771, d. 1854) was born in Irvine, Ayrshire,
Scotland. His father, a Moravian preacher, sent him to a Moravian school
at Fulneck, Yorkshire, England, to be educated. In 1794 he started “The
Sheffield Iris,” a weekly paper, which he edited, with marked ability,
till 1825. He was fined and imprisoned twice for publishing articles
decided to be seditious. His principal poetical works are “The World
before the Flood,” “Greenland,” “The West Indies,” “The Wanderer in
Switzerland,” “The Pelican Island,” and “Original Hymns, for Public,
Private, and Social Devotion.” Mr. Montgomery’s style is generally too
diffuse; but its smoothness and the evident sincerity of his emotions
have made many of his hymns and minor poems very popular. A pension of
300 Pounds a year was granted to him in 1833.</p>

<p>NOTE.—The incident related in this poem is one of actual occurrence,
and took place at the battle of Sempach, fought in 1386 A.D., between
only 1,300 Swiss and a large army of Austrians. The latter had obtained
possession of a narrow pass in the mountains, from which it seemed
impossible to dislodge them until Arnold von Winkelried made a breach in
their line, as narrated.</p>

<p>詹姆斯·蒙哥马利（1771—1854）出生于苏格兰艾尔郡的欧文镇。他的父亲，一位摩拉维亚教的传教士，将他送到英格兰约克郡福奈克的一所摩拉维亚教学校接受教育。
1794年，他开始创办《谢菲尔德鸢尾报》周报，表现出卓越的编辑能力，一直到1825退休。他曾两次因发表煽动性文章被罚款监禁。他的主要诗作有《洪水到来前的世界》、《绿地》、《西印度群岛》、《瑞士的流浪者》、《鹈鹕岛》以及《为公众、私人和社团敬拜而写的原创赞美诗》。蒙哥马利的诗歌结构通常过于松散，但是，文字的流畅和情感的真挚令他的许多赞美诗和短诗广受欢迎。

<p>THE ENGLISH SKYLARK</p>
<p>英国云雀</p>
<p>Elihu Burritt (b. 1810, d. 1879). “the learned blacksmith,” was born
in New Britain, Conn. His father was a shoemaker. Having received only a
limited amount of instruction at the district school, he was apprenticed
to a blacksmith about 1827. During his apprenticeship he labored hard at
self-instruction. He worked at his trade many years, from ten to twelve
hours each day, but managed, in the meantime to acquire a knowledge of
many ancient and modern languages. He made translations from several of
these, which were published in the “American Eclectic Review.” In 1844
he commenced the publication of “The Christian Citizen.” His leading
literary works are “Sparks from the Anvil,” “A Voice from the Forge,”
“Peace Papers,” and “Walks to John o’ Groat’s House.” From the last of
these the following selection is abridged.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Take it in all, no bird in either hemisphere equals the English
lark in heart or voice, for both unite to make it the sweetest, the
happiest, the welcomest singer that was ever winged, like the high
angels of God’s love. It is the living ecstasy [1] of joy when it mounts
up into its “glorious privacy of light.”</p></li>
<li><p>On the earth it is timid, silent, and bashful, as if not at home,
and not sure of its right to be there at all. It is rather homely
withal, having nothing in feather, feature, or form to attract notice.
It is seemingly made to be heard, not seen, reversing the old axiom [2]
addressed to children when getting noisy.</p></li>
<li><p>Its mission is music, and it floods a thousand acres of the blue
sky with it several times a day. Out of that palpitating [3] speck of
living joy there wells [4] forth a sea of twittering ecstasy upon the
morning and evening air. It does not ascend by gyrations [5] , like the
eagle and birds of prey. It mounts up like a human aspiration.</p></li>
<li><p>It seems to spread its wings and to be lifted straight upwards
out of sight by the afflatus [6] of its own happy heart. To pour out
this in undulating [7] rivulets of rhapsody [8] is apparently the only
motive of its ascension. This it is that has made it so loved of all
generations [9] .</p></li>
<li><p>It is the singing angel of man’s nearest heaven, whose vital
breath is music. Its sweet warbling is only the metrical [10]
palpitation of its life of joy. It goes up over the rooftrees [11] of
the rural hamlet [12] on the wings of its song, as if to train the human
soul to trial flights heavenward.</p></li>
<li><p>Never did the Creator put a voice of such volume into so small a
living thing. It is a marvel—almost a miracle. In a still hour you can
hear it at nearly a mile’s distance. When its form is lost in the hazy
lace work of the sun’s rays above, it pours down upon you all the
thrilling semitones of its song as distinctly as if it were warbling to
you in your window.</p></li>

<p>伊莱休·伯瑞特（1810—1879），这位“学识渊博的铁匠”出生于美国康涅狄格州新不列颠市，父亲是位鞋匠。伯瑞特只在地区学校里受过有限的教育，
1827左右，他成为一名铁匠学徒。学徒期间，他努力自学，经营打铁营生多年，每天工作十到十二个小时，却通过自学掌握了数门古代和当代的语言。他翻译了许多作品，并发表在《美国中庸评论》上。
1844年，伯瑞特着手出版《基督教公民》，他的文学代表作品有《铁砧的火花》、《从铁匠铺发出的声音》、《和平论文》和《走向约翰·奥格罗茨小镇》，本文便节选自最后这部作品。</p>

<li><p>就禀性和声音来说，全世界没有任何一种鸟儿能与英国云雀相媲美。英国云雀具有两者相得益彰的优秀禀赋，这使它成为鸟类当中最甜美、最快乐、最受欢迎的歌手，犹如上帝珍爱的高空中的天使一样。当它歌唱着，悦耳的声音传达到那“神圣荣光的栖息地”，你能从中感受到生命中令人心醉神迷的狂喜。</p></li>
<li><p>地球上的鸟类中，英国云雀胆怯腼腆、害羞安静。倘若不在巢穴，都会觉得不自在，似乎不知道自己是否有权利待在那个地方。英国云雀隶属家常鸟类，无论在羽毛、容貌或体态上，都没有什么吸引人的地方。它的存在，似乎只是为了宣泄歌声，而非展示容貌。这点其实颠覆了不言而喻的真相，与父母对吵闹的孩子们所训斥的道理大不相同。</p></li>
<li><p>音乐是云雀的使命。它的歌声，能每天数次散播到一千多亩范围的湛蓝天空。从这只胸膛悸动的快乐鸟儿嘴里，能唱出一片幸福呢喃的音乐海洋，弥漫在早晨和夜晚的空气中。云雀不会像苍鹰和其他猛禽那样盘旋着飞上高空。它会笔直地飞上天空，如同人类的呼吸吐纳。</p></li>
<li><p>云雀似乎只要张开翅膀，凭借内心愉悦气息，便可径直飞腾向上，飞出人们的视线之外。很显然，在这种像狂想曲一般波浪起伏的飞翔中，唱出自己内心的喜悦，便是它飞上高空的唯一动机——这也是云雀备受历代人们喜爱的缘故。</p></li>
<li><p>云雀是人类最接近天堂的吟唱天使。它的呼吸气息谱写出优美音符，它柔美的颤音来自它喜悦的胸膛里带着韵律的心跳。乘着歌声的翅膀，云雀高高地盘旋在乡村农舍的屋顶上，似乎在激励人类的灵魂朝着天堂的方向飞翔。</p></li>
<li><p>除了英国云雀之外，造物主从未将如此天籁施以这样娇小的生灵。这是一个奇迹——近乎神迹。当万籁静谧，你甚至可以听见几乎一英里之外云雀的悦耳歌声。在朦胧的雾霭中，云雀的身影隐去不见，你却仍然能听见它那令人心颤的婉鸣，清晰得像是它正立在你的窗前为你鸣啾歌唱。</p></li>

<p>William Collins (b. 1721, d. 1759) was born at Chichester, England.
He was educated at Winchester and Oxford. About 1745, he went to London
as a literary adventurer, and there won the esteem of Dr. Johnson. His
“Odes” were published in 1746, but were not popular. He was subsequently
relieved from pecuniary embarrassment by a legacy of 2,000 Pounds from a
maternal uncle; but he soon became partially insane, and was for some
time confined in an asylum for lunatics. He afterwards retired to
Chichester, where he was cared for by his sister until his death.</p>

afterwards was appointed to the professorship of poetry in that
university. Since his death, Keble College, at Oxford, has been erected
to his memory. In 1835, he became vicar of Hursley and rector of
Otterbourne, and held these livings until his death. His most famous
work is “The Christian Year,” a collection of sacred poems.</p>

<p>SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS</p>
<p>约翰·亚当斯的假想演说</p>
<p>Daniel Webster (b. 1782, d. 1852) was born in Salisbury, N.H. He
spent a few months of his boyhood at Phillips Academy, Exeter, but
fitted for college under Rev. Samuel Wood, of Boscawen, N.H. He
graduated from Dartmouth College in 1801. He taught school several
terms, during and after his college course. In 1805, he was admitted to
the bar in Boston, and practiced law in New Hampshire for the succeeding
eleven years. In 1812, he was elected to the United States House of
Representatives. In 1816, he removed to Boston, and in 1827 was elected
to the United States Senate, which position he held for twelve years. In
1841, he was appointed Secretary of State. He returned to the Senate in
1845. In 1850, he was reappointed Secretary of State and continued in
office until his death. He died at his residence, in Marshfield, Mass.
Mr. Webster’s fame rests chiefly on his state papers and speeches. As a
speaker he was dignified and stately, using clear, pure English. During
all his life he took great interest in agriculture, and was very fond of
outdoor sports.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my
heart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that, in the beginning, we aimed
not at independence. But</li>
</ol>
<p>“There’s a divinity that shapes our ends.”</p>
<p>The injustice of England has driven us to arms; and blinded to her
own interest, she has obstinately persisted, till independence is now
within our grasp. We have but to reach forth to it, and it is ours. Why
then should we defer the declaration? Is any man so weak as now to hope
for a reconciliation [1] with England, which shall leave either safety
to the country and its liberties, or security to his own life and his
own honor! Are not you, sir, who sit in that chair, is not he, our
venerable colleague [2] , near you, are you not both already the
proscribed [3] and predestined [4] objects of punishment and of
vengeance? Cut off from all hope of royal clemency [5] , what are you,
what can you be, while the power of England remains, but outlaws?</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>If we postpone independence, do we mean to carry on, or to give
up, the war? Do we mean to submit, and consent that we shall be ground
to powder, and our country and its rights trodden down in the dust? I
know we do not mean to submit. We NEVER shall submit! Do we intend to
violate that most solemn obligation ever entered into by men, that
plighting, before God, of our sacred honor to Washington, when, putting
him forth to incur the dangers of war, as well as the political hazards
of the times, we promised to adhere to him in every extremity with our
fortunes and our lives? I know there is not a man here, who would not
rather see a general conflagration sweep over the land, or an earthquake
sink it, than one jot or tittle [6] of that plighted faith fall to the
ground. For myself, having twelve months ago, in this place, moved you
that George Washington be appointed commander of the forces raised, or
to be raised, for the defense of American liberty; may my right hand
forget her cunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I
hesitate or waver in the support I give him.</p></li>
<li><p>The war, then, must go on. We must fight it through. And if the
war must go on, why put off the Declaration of Independence? That
measure will strengthen us. It will give us character abroad. Nations
will then treat with us, which they never can do while we acknowledge
ourselves subjects in arms against our sovereign. Nay, I maintain that
England herself will sooner treat for peace with us on the footing of
independence, than consent, by repealing her acts, to acknowledge that
her whole conduct toward us has been a course of injustice and
oppression. Her pride will be less wounded by submitting to that course
of things, which now predestinates our independence, than by yielding
the points in controversy [7] to her rebellious subjects. The former,
she would regard as the result of fortune; the latter, she would feel as
her own deep disgrace. Why, then, do we not change this from a civil to
a national war? And since we must fight it through, why not put
ourselves in a state to enjoy all the benefits of victory, if we gain
the victory.</p></li>
<li><p>If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall not fail. The
cause will raise up armies; the cause will create navies. The people—the
people, if we are true to them, will carry us, and will carry
themselves, gloriously through this struggle. I care not how fickle
other people have been found. I know the people of these colonies; and I
know that resistance to British aggression is deep and settled in their
hearts, and can not be eradicated [8] . Sir, the Declaration of
Independence will inspire the people with increased courage. Instead of
a long and bloody war for the restoration of privileges, for redress [9]
of grievances, for chartered [10] immunities [11] , held under a British
king, set before them the glorious object of entire independence, and it
will breathe into them anew the spirit of life.</p></li>
<li><p>Read this declaration at the head of the army; every sword will
be drawn, and the solemn vow uttered to maintain it, or perish on the
bed of honor. Publish it from the pulpit; religion will approve it, and
the love of religious liberty will cling around it, resolved to stand
with it or fall with it. Send it to the public halls; proclaim it there;
let them see it who saw their brothers and their sons fall on the field
of Bunker Hill and in the streets of Lexington and Concord, and the very
walls will cry out in its support.</p></li>
<li><p>Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see—I see
clearly through this day’s business. You and I, indeed, may rue it. We
may not live to see the time this declaration shall be made good. We may
die; die colonists; die slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously and on the
scaffold. Be it so: be it so. If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my
country shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be
ready at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But
while I do live, let me have a country, or at least the hope of a
country, and that a FREE country.</p></li>
<li><p>But whatever may be our fate, be assured—be assured that this
Declaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood; but
it will stand, and it will richly compensate [12] for both. Through the
thick gloom of the present I see the brightness of the future as the sun
in heaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we are
in our graves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it with
thanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations. On its
annual return they will shed tears,—copious, gushing tears; not of
subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of
gratitude, and of joy.</p></li>
<li><p>Sir, before God I believe the hour is come. My judgment approves
the measure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I have, and all that
I am, and all that I hope in this life, I am now ready here to stake
upon it; and I leave off as I began, that, live or die, survive or
perish, I am for the Declaration. It is my living sentiment, and, by the
blessing of God, it shall by my dying sentiment; independence now, and
INDEPENDENCE FOREVER.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Notes.—Mr. Webster, in a speech upon the life and character of John
Adams, imagines some one opposed to the Declaration of Independence to
have stated his fears and objections before Congress while deliberating
on that subject. He then supposes Mr. Adams to have replied in the
language above.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>沉沦抑或求生，活着抑或死亡，幸存抑或毁灭？我全身心地支持这一投票表决。诚然，战争刚开始时，我们并不是为谋取独立而战，但是，</li>
</ol>
<p>上帝，已决定了我们的宿命。</p>
<p>英国的不公平对待，驱使我们拿起武器。英国被自身利益蒙蔽了双眼，始终负隅顽抗，直到最终我们将独立掌控在自己手中。我们尽力争取自由，现在，它已属于我们。那么，我们为什么要延迟发表这份独立宣言？难道现在还有人如此软弱，希望与英国和解？难道和解能为这个国家带来安全与自由，抑或给他生活带来保障甚至个人荣耀？这位坐在椅子上的主席先生，还有您身旁那位受人尊重的同僚，我们难道不都是已被剥夺公权，命中注定沦为惩罚与复仇的对象？摒弃那些高尚以及仁慈宽容的所有希望，一旦英国统治权威得以保留，那我们除了是法外之徒，还能是什么？我们还能成为什么？</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>如果我们推迟独立，那么我们是打算继续还是放弃这场战争？难道我们打算投降，同意被继续压制，并让我们的国家主权和人民权利被践踏成灰吗？我相信，我们并不打算投降，我们永远不会投降！我们曾在上帝面前宣誓，不管在任何危难中，都要追随华盛顿总统，即使要倾尽家产或为之浴血牺牲。难道我们竟试图违背这个人类有史以来做出的最神圣的誓言，令他蒙受战争危险以及深陷当下的政治时局？我深知，在座的各位宁愿看到战火席卷这片土地，或是突如其来的地震令它坍塌，也不愿抛弃曾经的誓约，哪怕最微小的背信弃义。对我来说，一年前，就在这个地方，我投票通过动议，任命乔治·华盛顿为美国独立战争的最高指挥官。现在，如果我对是否支持他有所动摇或踌躇，愿我的右手受到诅咒，愿我的舌头从此贴着上颚，再也说不出话！</p></li>
<li><p>因此，这场战争必须继续，我们必须继续打下去。既然战争要打下去，那么，我们为什么要推迟发表《独立宣言》？昭示天下只会增强我们的力量，并赋予我们面向外界的能力。只有当我们将自己视为抗击侵犯我们主权的敌人的主体时，其他国家才会这样看待我们。是的，我相信，如果是以独立的名义，而不是以废除英国法案的名义逼他们承认对我们施加的所有行为始终缺乏公平正义且残忍暴虐，那么，英国也会更愿意与我们协商和谈。承认我们独立，比起屈服于反叛者的观点，更能维护大英帝国的颜面。因为，如果是前者，英国会将战败视为运气；但如果是后者，战败则会让英国深感耻辱。既然如此，我们为何不将这场战争从一场内战转变为民族之战？既然这场战争必须打下去，我们为何不转变角度，如果我们取得胜利，为什么不愿完全享受到胜利带来的喜悦？</p></li>
<li><p>如果我们失败了，这对我们来说是最糟糕的境况。但是，我们绝不会失败。在“独立”的旗帜下，军队会被兴建起来，海军也会被组建起来。人民！如果我们真心对待人民，他们便会支持我们，因为这也正是在支持他们自己，通过这场战争光荣地支持他们自己！我不介意有些人总是善变无常。我了解这些殖民地的人民，我清楚，他们对英国侵略者的刻骨仇恨深深扎根于他们的内心，永不消除。先生们，《独立宣言》将鼓舞人民增强战斗的勇气。这场漫长而血腥的战争，并非旨在恢复某些人的特权，并非为平反某些冤情，并非为获取英国国王赐予的特许豁免权——摆在人民面前的，是一项彻底独立的宏图大业！这必然能为他们注入崭新的生命。</p></li>
<li><p>在整个军队面前宣读这份宣言吧！每个人都会拔出长剑，庄严宣誓为之而战，或是带着荣耀而死。在教堂的讲道台上公示出这份宣言吧！教会将认可它，对宗教自由的信仰将与这份宣言密切相连，并与它同荣辱，共存亡。在公众场合发出这份宣言吧！在那里宣示出我们的信念，让那些曾经在邦克山的田野里、列克星敦和康科德的街道上目睹自己的兄弟或儿子倒下的民众看到，他们必将发出支持独立宣言的坚定吼声。</p></li>
<li><p>先生们，我深知人类事物的不确定性，但我看到——是的，我清楚地看到眼下的局势。诚然，我们，你和我，也许会为此后悔，我们可能活不到《独立宣言》将为民众带来福音的那一天。我们也许死去，作为殖民地平民而死，作为奴隶而亡。如果上帝决定，我的祖国需要一些牺牲者来献出生命，那么，我愿做好准备，坦然接受那个光荣时刻的降临。然而，如果我能幸存于世，请让我拥有自己的祖国，或至少拥有对祖国的希望！我的祖国，应该是一个独立自由的国家！</p></li>
<li><p>但是，无论我们命运如何，请相信——请相信，这份《独立宣言》必将长存。或许为此耗费巨大，或许会有众多流血牺牲，但它会始终长存，并会带来极大的回报。透过眼前的厚重阴霾，我能看见未来的光明，如同天堂的明媚阳光。今天将留存于史，光荣不朽的一天。当我们走进坟墓，子孙后代将以此为荣。他们将用感恩之心、节日欢腾，以篝火和斑斓灯饰来庆贺这一伟大神圣时刻的到来。每逢周年纪念日，孩子们将泪如雨下——那些喷涌而出的泪水，并非为专制或奴隶制伤悲，并非为极端痛苦或窘迫贫穷，而是因为难以抑制的狂喜，难以言谢的感恩，还有难以表述的幸福。</p></li>
<li><p>先生们，在上帝面前，我相信，这个神圣的时刻即将到来。我的判断为权衡时事提供依据，我的满腔激情也倾注其中。我所拥有的一切，我所有的存在，以及我在生活中的所有希冀，现在，我已做好准备以此作为赌注，为独立而战。最后，我愿重复这篇演说开始时我曾说过的话：生存抑或死亡，苟存抑或毁灭，我将为《独立宣言》存活于世。它是我生命的宣言，愿上帝保佑我，它也将是我死亡的宣言：现在独立，意味独立永远！</p></li>

<p>Thomas Buchanan Read (b. 1822, d. 1872) was born in Chester County,
Pennsylvania. In 1839 he entered a sculptor’s studio in Cincinnati,
where he gained reputation as a portrait painter. He afterwards went to
New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and, in 1850, to Italy. He divided
his time between Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Rome, in the latter years
of his life. Some or his poems are marked by vigor and strength, while
others are distinguished by smoothness and delicacy. The following
celection is abridged from “The Wagoner of the Alleghanies.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Out of the North the wild news came,</li>
</ol>
<p>Far flashing on its wings of flame,</p>
<p>Swift as the boreal [1] light which flies</p>
<p>At midnight through the startled skies.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>And there was tumult in the air,</li>
</ol>
<p>The fife’s shrill note, the drum’s loud beat,</p>
<p>And through the wide land everywhere</p>
<p>The answering tread of hurrying feet,</p>
<p>While the first oath of Freedom’s gun</p>
<p>Came on the blast from Lexington.</p>
<p>And Concord, roused, no longer tame,</p>
<p>Forgot her old baptismal name,</p>
<p>Made bare her patriot arm of power,</p>
<p>And swelled the discord of the hour.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The yeoman [2] and the yoeman’s son,</li>
</ol>
<p>With knitted brows and sturdy dint [3] ,</p>
<p>Renewed the polish of each gun,</p>
<p>Recoiled the lock, reset the flint;</p>
<p>And oft the maid and matron there,</p>
<p>While kneeling in the firelight glare,</p>
<p>Long poured, with half-suspended breath,</p>
<p>The lead into the molds of death.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The hands by Heaven made silken soft</li>
</ol>
<p>To soothe the brow of love or pain,</p>

<p>But under the celestial bound</p>
<p>No nobler picture can be found</p>

<p>In vain their feet with loitering tread</p>
<p>Passed ’mid the graves where rank is naught:</p>
<p>All could not read the lesson taught</p>
<p>In that republic of the dead.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>The pastor [6] rose: the prayer was strong;</li>

<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>He spoke of wrongs too long endured,</li>
</ol>
<p>Of sacred rights to be secured;</p>
<p>Then from his patriot tongue of flame</p>
<p>The startling words for Freedom came.</p>
<p>The stirring sentences he spake</p>
<p>Compelled the heart to glow or quake,</p>
<p>And, rising on his theme’s [7] broad wing,</p>
<p>And grasping in his nervous hand</p>
<p>The imaginary battle brand,</p>
<p>In face of death he dared to fling</p>
<p>Defiance to a tyrant king.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Even as he spoke, his frame, renewed</li>
</ol>
<p>In eloquence of attitude,</p>
<p>Rose, as it seemed, a shoulder higher;</p>
<p>Then swept his kindling glance of fire</p>
<p>From startled pew to breathless choir;</p>
<p>When suddenly his mantle wide</p>
<p>His hands impatient flung aside,</p>
<p>And, lo! he met their wondering eyes</p>
<p>Complete in all a warrior’s guise [8] .</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>A moment there was awful pause,—</li>
</ol>
<p>When Berkley cried, “Cease, traitor! cease!</p>

<p>The other shouted, “Nay, not so,</p>
<p>When God is with our righteous cause:</p>
<p>His holiest places then are ours,</p>
<p>His temples are our forts and towers</p>
<p>That frown upon the tyrant foe:</p>

<p>The warrior priest had ordered so—</p>
<p>The enlisting trumpet’s sudden soar [9]</p>
<p>Rang through the chapel, o’er and o’er,</p>
<p>Its long reverberating blow,</p>
<p>So loud and clear, it seemed the ear</p>
<p>Of dusty death must wake and hear.</p>
<p>And there the startling drum and fife</p>
<p>Fired the living with fiercer life;</p>
<p>While overhead with wild increase,</p>
<p>Forgetting its ancient toll of peace,</p>
<p>The great bell swung as ne’er before:</p>
<p>It seemed as it would never cease;</p>

<p>托马斯·布坎南·瑞德（1822—1872）出生于美国宾夕法尼亚州切斯特县。
1839年，他进入辛辛那提一个雕塑家的工作室里学习，随后作为肖像画家声名鹊起。他后来辗转纽约、波士顿和费城，并于1850年去了意大利。在他的后半生里，瑞德经常在辛辛那提、费城和罗马几处来回奔波。他的诗歌有些以激情有力见长，有些则以优美流畅闻名遐迩。下面段落节选自他的诗歌《阿利根尼斯的瓦格纳》。</p>

<p>CONTROL [1] YOUR TEMPER</p>
<p>请君制怒</p>
<p>John Todd, D.D. (b. 1800, d. 1873), was born in Rutland, Vt. In 1842
he was settled as a pastor of a Congregational Church, in Pittsfield,
Mass, In 1834, he published “Lectures to Children”; in 1835, “The
Student’s Manual,” a valuable and popular work, which has been
translated into several European languages; in 1836, “The Sabbath-School
Teacher”; and in 1841, “The Lost Sister of Wyoming.” He was one of the
founders of the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>No one has a temper naturally so good, that it does not need
attention and cultivation [2] , and no one has a temper so bad, but
that, by proper culture, it may become pleasant. One of the best
disciplined [3] tempers ever seen, was that of a gentleman who was
naturally quick, irritable, rash, and violent; but, by having the care
of the sick, and especially of deranged people, he so completely
mastered himself that he was never known to be thrown off his
guard.</p></li>
<li><p>The difference in the happiness which is received or bestowed by
the man who governs his temper, and that by the man who does not, is
immense. There is no misery so constant, so distressing, and so
intolerable [4] to others, as that of having a disposition which is your
master, and which is continually fretting itself. There are corners
enough, at every turn in life, against which we may run, and at which we
may break out in impatience, if we choose.</p></li>
<li><p>Look at Roger Sherman, who rose from a humble occupation to a
seat in the first Congress of the United States, and whose judgment was
received with great deference [5] by that body of distinguished men. He
made himself master of his temper, and cultivated it as a great business
in life. There are one or two instances which show this part of his
character in a light that is beautiful.</p></li>
<li><p>One day, after having received his highest honors, he was sitting
and reading in his parlor. A roguish student, in a room close by, held a
looking-glass in such a position as to pour the reflected rays of the
sun directly in Mr. Sherman’s face. He moved his chair, and the thing
was repeated. A third time the chair was moved, but the looking-glass
still reflected the sun in his eyes. He laid aside his book, went to the
window, and many witnesses of the impudence expected to hear the
ungentlemanly student severely reprimanded [6] . He raised the window
gently, and then—shut the window blind!</p></li>
<li><p>I can not forbear adducing another instance of the power he had
acquired over himself. He was naturally possessed of strong passions;
but over these he at length obtained an extraordinary control. He became
habitually calm, sedate, and self-possessed. Mr. Sherman was one of
those men who are not ashamed to maintain the forms of religion in their
families. One morning he called them all together, as usual, to lead
them in prayer to God; the “old family Bible” was brought out, and laid
on the table.</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. Sherman took his seat, and placed beside him one of his
children, a child of his old age; the rest of the family were seated
around the room; several of these were now grown up. Besides these, some
of the tutors of the college were boarders in the family, and were
present at the time alluded to. His aged and superannuated [7] mother
occupied a corner of the room, opposite the place where the
distinguished judge sat.</p></li>
<li><p>At length, he opened the Bible, and began to read. The child who
was seated beside him made some little disturbance, upon which
Mr. Sherman paused and told it to be still. Again he proceeded; but
again he paused to reprimand the little offender, whose playful
disposition would scarcely permit it to be still. And this time he
gently tapped its ear. The blow, if blow it might be called, caught the
attention of his aged mother, who now, with some effort, rose from the
seat, and tottered across the room. At length she reached the chair of
Mr. Sherman, and, in a moment, most unexpectedly to him, she gave him a
blow on the ear with all the force she could summon. “There,” said she,
“you strike your child, and I will strike mine.”</p></li>
<li><p>For a moment, the blood was seen mounting to the face of
Mr. Sherman; but it was only for a moment, when all was calm and mild as
usual. He paused; he raised his spectacles; he cast his eye upon his
mother; again it fell upon the book from which he had been reading. Not
a word escaped him; but again he calmly pursued the service, and soon
after sought in prayer an ability to set an example before his household
which would be worthy of their imitation. Such a victory was worth more
than the proudest one ever achieved [8] on the field of battle.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE.—Roger Sherman (b. 1721, d. 1793) was born at Newton
Massachusetts, and until twenty-two years of age was a shoemaker. He
then removed to New Milford, Connecticut, and was soon afterward
appointed surveyor of lands for the county. In 1754, he was admitted to
the bar. At various times he was elected a judge; sent to the
Legislature, to the Colonial Assembly, and to the United States
Congress; made a member of the governor’s council of safety; and, in
1776, a member of the committee appointed to draft the Declaration of
Independence, of which he was one of the signers.</p>

<li><p>没有人天生就有好脾气，好到不需要关注或培养；也没有人天生就是坏脾气，通过合适的教养，坏脾气也能变好。世人曾见过最好脾气的人之一，便是这样一位绅士，他天性反应敏捷、易被激怒、鲁莽暴力；但是，通过照料病人，尤其是那些狂躁的精神病患者，他最终能够彻底控制自身情绪。至于他的坏脾气，甚至不为人知。</p></li>
<li><p>一个能控制自身脾气的人所能感受到或能被赋予的幸福感，是一个无法控制脾气的人所无法感受到的。如果一个人任由情绪控制自己，任凭被它反复折磨，再没有什么比这能带给他人更持久、更令人烦恼、更难以忍受的痛苦了。在人的一生中，我们总是会遇到各种各样的挫折；在挫折面前，倘若可以选择，我们或许急于逃避，或许丧失耐性。</p></li>
<li><p>看看罗杰·谢尔曼吧。他出生贫寒，从社会底层做起，直到在美国第一届国会拥有一席之地。在国会议员当中，他的判断力颇受国会精英名流的仰慕尊崇。谢尔曼先生对自身性情掌控从容，并在生活中将情绪管理作为至关重要的素养精心培育。在此，我愿举出一两个例子，来展示他光彩照人的性格魅力。</p></li>
<li><p>有一天，当荣获最高荣誉后，他坐在客厅里读书。一个淘气的学生，在隔壁房间举起一面镜子，透过窗户，将太阳光径直反射在谢尔曼先生的脸上。他挪动了一下椅子，不过还是未能逃过刺眼的光线。如此再三，光线仍然追逐着他的眼睛。最后，他索性放下书本，走到窗前，周围目睹了这一幕的许多人都以为这下他该严厉斥责这个缺乏教养的学生了。没想到，他只是将窗户提起少许，然后——拉上百叶窗！</p></li>
<li><p>在此，我忍不住要再举一个例子，好让大家看看谢尔曼先生拥有多么强大的自控力。他天性激情洋溢，但凡事却冷静沉稳，自我克制，最终养成了非凡的情绪控制能力。谢尔曼先生向来是个乐于延续家庭宗教传统的男人，一天早上，他像往常一样，把家人聚集到一起，带着他们向上帝祷告。他取出家里世代相传的《圣经》，放置桌上。</p></li>
<li><p>谢尔曼先生坐下，将他晚年所生的最小的孩子放在身边座位上，其他家庭成员围坐在房间里，其中几个孩子已经长大成人。除此之外，还有几个在他们家里寄宿的家庭教师，都已按时到场。他耄耋之年的老母亲依偎角落，正坐在这位声名显赫的法官对面。</p></li>
<li><p>大家都安顿好以后，谢尔曼先生打开《圣经》开始朗读。坐在他身边的小儿子闹出些许响动，谢尔曼先生停顿了一下，告诉他保持安静。然后，他又继续朗读，但很快又停下来，责备这不懂事的小家伙，这生性好动的孩子几乎没法保持安静。这一次，他轻轻地拍了拍孩子的耳朵。这个“拍打”，如果这也能算是拍打的话，吸引了他老母亲的注意力。于是，老太太费力地从椅子上站起来，步履蹒跚地穿过房间，终于走到谢尔曼先生的椅子跟前，站立了片刻。令他始料未及的是，老母亲突然用尽全身力气，狠狠地给了他一记响亮的耳光。“就是这样，”她说，“既然你要打你的儿子，我也要打我的儿子。”</p></li>
<li><p>片刻工夫，谢尔曼先生涨红了脸。但那只持续了短短的一瞬间，很快，他便像往常一样平静而温和。他停顿了一下，重新戴好眼镜，看了看母亲；然后，他的视线再度落到《圣经》上。他的嘴里没发出一个反驳的声音。他开始祷告，祈求上帝赐予他能力，为家人树立起一个值得效仿的榜样；接着，他平静地继续主持完家庭敬拜。这样的胜利，比一个军人在战场上所能获得的最高荣耀，更令人骄傲。</p></li>

<p>威廉·泰尔 （上）</p>
<p>James Sheridan Knowles (b. 1784, d. 1862), a dramatist and actor, was
born in Cork, Ireland. In 1792 his father removed to London with his
family. At the age of fourteen, Sheridan wrote an opera called “The
Chevalier de Grillon.” In 1798 he removed to Dublin, and soon after
began his career as an actor and author. In 1835 he visited America. In
1839 an annual pension of 200 Pounds was granted him by the British
government. Several years before his death he left the stage and became
a Baptist minister. The best known of his plays are “Caius Gracchus,”
“Virginius,” “Leo, the Gypsy,” “The Hunchback,” and “William Tell,” from
the last of which the following two lessons are abridged.</p>
<p>SCENE 1.—A Chamber in the Castle. Enter Gesler, Officers, and
Sarnem,</p>
<p>with Tell in chains and guarded.</p>
<p>Sar . Down, slave! Behold the governor.</p>
<p>Down! down! and beg for mercy.</p>
<p>Ges . (Seated.) Does he hear?</p>
<p>Sar . He does, but braves thy power.</p>
<p>Officer . Why don’t you smite him for that look?</p>
<p>Ges . Can I believe</p>
<p>My eyes? He smiles! Nay, grasps</p>
<p>His chains as he would make a weapon of them</p>
<p>To lay the smiter dead. (To Tell.)</p>
<p>Why speakest thou not?</p>
<p>Tell . For wonder.</p>
<p>Ges . Wonder?</p>
<p>Tell . Yes, that thou shouldst seem a man.</p>
<p>Ges . What should I seem?</p>
<p>Tell . A monster.</p>
<p>Ges . Ha! Beware! Think on thy chains.</p>
<p>Tell . Though they were doubled, and did weigh me down</p>
<p>Prostrate to the earth, methinks I could rise up</p>
<p>Erect, with nothing but the honest pride</p>
<p>Of telling thee, usurper, to thy teeth,</p>
<p>Thou art a monster! Think upon my chains?</p>
<p>How came they on me?</p>
<p>Ges . Darest thou question me?</p>
<p>Tell . Darest thou not answer?</p>
<p>Ges . Do I hear?</p>
<p>Tell . Thou dost.</p>
<p>Ges . Beware my vengeance!</p>
<p>Tell . Can it more than kill?</p>
<p>Ges . Enough; it can do that.</p>
<p>Tell . No; not enough:</p>
<p>It can not take away the grace of life;</p>
<p>Its comeliness [1] of look that virtue gives;</p>
<p>Its port [2] erect with consciousness of truth;</p>
<p>Its rich attire [3] of honorable deeds;</p>
<p>Its fair report that’s rife on good men’s tongues;</p>
<p>It can not lay its hands on these, no more</p>
<p>Than it can pluck the brightness from the sun,</p>
<p>Or with polluted finger tarnish [4] it.</p>
<p>Ges . But it can make thee writhe.</p>
<p>Tell . It may.</p>
<p>Ges . And groan.</p>
<p>Tell . It may; and I may cry</p>
<p>Go on, though it should make me groan again.</p>
<p>Ges . Whence comest thou?</p>
<p>Tell . From the mountains. Wouldst thou learn</p>
<p>What news from thence?</p>
<p>Ges . Canst tell me any?</p>
<p>Tell . Ay: they watch no more the avalanche [5] .</p>
<p>Ges . Why so?</p>
<p>Tell . Because they look for thee. The hurricane</p>
<p>Comes unawares upon them; from its bed</p>
<p>The torrent breaks, and finds them in its track.</p>
<p>Ges . What do they then?</p>
<p>Tell . Thank heaven it is not thou!</p>
<p>Thou hast perverted nature in them.</p>
<p>There’s not a blessing heaven vouchsafes [6] them, but</p>
<p>The thought of thee—doth wither to a curse.</p>
<p>Ges . That’s right! I’d have them like their hills,</p>
<p>That never smile, though wanton [7] summer tempt</p>
<p>Them e’er so much.</p>
<p>Tell . But they do sometimes smile.</p>
<p>Ges . Ay! when is that?</p>
<p>Tell . When they do talk of vengeance.</p>
<p>Ges . Vengeance? Dare they talk of that?</p>
<p>Tell . Ay, and expect it too.</p>
<p>Ges . From whence?</p>
<p>Tell . From heaven!</p>
<p>Ges . From heaven?</p>
<p>Tell . And their true hands</p>
<p>Are lifted up to it on every hill</p>
<p>For justice on thee.</p>
<p>Ges . Where’s thy abode?</p>
<p>Tell . I told thee, on the mountains.</p>
<p>Ges . Art married?</p>
<p>Tell . Yes.</p>
<p>Ges . And hast a family?</p>
<p>Tell . A son.</p>
<p>Ges . A son? Sarnem!</p>
<p>Sar . My lord, the boy—( Gesler signs to Sarnem to keep silence,
and,</p>
<p>whispering, sends him off. )</p>
<p>Tell . The boy? What boy?</p>
<p>Is ’t mine? and have they netted [8] my young fledgeling [9] ?</p>
<p>Now heaven support me, if they have! He’ll own me,</p>
<p>And share his father’s ruin! But a look</p>
<p>Would put him on his guard—yet how to give it!</p>
<p>Now heart, thy nerve; forget thou ’rt flesh, be rock.</p>
<p>They come, they come!</p>
<p>That step—that step—that little step, so light</p>
<p>Upon the ground, how heavy does it fall</p>
<p>Upon my heart! I feel my child! ( Enter Sarnem</p>
<p>with Albert, whose eyes are riveted on Tell’s bow,</p>
<p>which Sarnem carries. )</p>
<p>’T is he! We can but perish.</p>
<p>Alb . ( Aside. ) Yes; I was right. It is my father’s bow!</p>
<p>For there’s my father! I’ll not own him though!</p>
<p>Sar . See!</p>
<p>Alb . What?</p>
<p>Sar . Look there!</p>
<p>Alb . I do, what would you have me see?</p>
<p>Sar . Thy father.</p>
<p>Alb . Who? That—that my father?</p>
<p>Tell . My boy! my boy! my own brave boy!</p>
<p>He’s safe! ( Aside. )</p>
<p>Sar . ( Aside to Gesler. ) They’re like each other.</p>
<p>Ges . Yet I see no sign</p>
<p>Of recognition [10] to betray the link</p>
<p>Unites a father and his child.</p>
<p>Sar . My lord, I am sure it is his father. Look at them.</p>
<p>That boy did spring from him; or never cast</p>
<p>Came from the mold it fitted! It may be</p>
<p>A preconcerted [11] thing ’gainst such a chance.</p>
<p>That they survey each other coldly thus.</p>
<p>Ges . We shall try. Lead forth the caitiff [12] .</p>
<p>Sar . To a dungeon?</p>
<p>Ges . No; into the court.</p>
<p>Sar . The court, my lord?</p>
<p>Ges . And send</p>
<p>To tell the headsman to make ready. Quick!</p>
<p>The slave shall die! You marked the boy?</p>
<p>Sar . I did. He started; ’t is his father.</p>
<p>Ges . We shall see. Away with him!</p>
<p>Tell . Stop! Stop!</p>
<p>Ges . What would you?</p>
<p>Tell . Time,— A little time to call my thoughts together!</p>
<p>Ges . Thou shalt not have a minute.</p>
<p>Tell . Some one, then, to speak with.</p>
<p>Ges . Hence with him!</p>
<p>Tell . A moment! Stop! Let me speak to the boy.</p>
<p>Ges . Is he thy son?</p>
<p>Tell . And if He were, art thou so lost to nature, as</p>
<p>To send me forth to die before his face?</p>
<p>Ges . Well! speak with him.</p>
<p>Now, Sarnem, mark them well.</p>
<p>Tell . Thou dost not know me, boy; and well for thee</p>
<p>Thou dost not. I’m the father of a son</p>
<p>About thy age. Thou, I see, wast horn, like him, upon the hills:</p>
<p>If thou shouldst ’scape thy present thraldom [13] , he</p>
<p>May chance to cross thee; if he should, I pray thee</p>
<p>Relate to him what has been passing here,</p>
<p>And say I laid my hand upon thy head,</p>
<p>And said to thee, if he were here, as thou art,</p>
<p>Thus would I bless him. Mayst thou live, my boy,</p>
<p>To see thy country free, or die for her,</p>
<p>As I do! ( Albert weeps. )</p>
<p>Sar . Mark! he weeps.</p>
<p>Tell . Were he my son,</p>
<p>He would not shed a tear! He would remember</p>
<p>The cliff where he was bred, and learned to scan [14]</p>
<p>A thousand fathoms’ depth of nether [15] air;</p>
<p>Where he was trained to hear the thunder talk,</p>
<p>And meet the lightning, eye to eye; where last</p>
<p>We spoke together, when I told him death</p>
<p>Bestowed the brightest gem that graces life,</p>
<p>Embraced for virtue’s sake. He shed a tear!</p>
<p>Now were he by, I’d talk to him, and his cheek</p>
<p>Should never blanch [16] , nor moisture dim his eye—</p>
<p>I’d talk to him—</p>
<p>Sar . He falters!</p>
<p>Tell . ’T is too much!</p>
<p>And yet it must be done! I’d talk to him—</p>
<p>Ges . Of what?</p>
<p>Tell . The mother, tyrant, thou dost make</p>
<p>A widow of! I’d talk to him of her.</p>
<p>I’d bid him tell her, next to liberty,</p>
<p>Her name was the last word my lips pronounced.</p>
<p>And I would charge him never to forget</p>
<p>To love and cherish her, as he would have</p>
<p>His father’s dying blessing rest upon him!</p>
<p>Sar . You see, as he doth prompt, the other acts.</p>
<p>Tell . So well he bears it, he doth vanquish me.</p>
<p>My boy! my boy! Oh, for the hills, the hills,</p>
<p>To see him bound along their tops again,</p>
<p>With liberty.</p>
<p>Sar . Was there not an the father in that look?</p>
<p>Ges . Yet ’t is ’gainst nature.</p>
<p>Sar . Not if he believes</p>
<p>To own the son would be to make him share</p>
<p>The father’s death.</p>
<p>Ges . I did not think of that! ’T is well</p>
<p>The boy is not thy son. I’ve destined him</p>
<p>To die along with thee.</p>
<p>Tell . To die? For what?</p>
<p>Ges . For having braved my power, as thou hast. Lead them forth.</p>
<p>Tell . He’s but a child.</p>
<p>Ges . Away with them!</p>
<p>Tell . Perhaps an only child.</p>
<p>Ges . No matter.</p>
<p>Tell . He may have a mother.</p>
<p>Ges . So the viper hath;</p>
<p>And yet, who spares it for the mother’s sake?</p>
<p>Tell . I talk to stone! I talk to it as though</p>
<p>’T were flesh; and know ’t is none. I’ll talk to it</p>
<p>No more. Come, my boy;</p>
<p>I taught thee how to live, I’ll show thee how to die.</p>
<p>Ges . He is thy child?</p>
<p>Tell . He is my child. (Weeps.)</p>
<p>Ges . I’ve wrung a tear from him! Thy name?</p>
<p>Tell . My name?</p>
<p>It matters not to keep it from thee now;</p>
<p>My name is Tell.</p>
<p>Ges . Tell? William Tell [17] ?</p>
<p>Tell . The same.</p>
<p>Ges . What! he, so famed ’bove all his countrymen,</p>
<p>For guiding o’er the stormy lake the boat?</p>
<p>And such a master of his bow, ’t is said</p>
<p>His arrows never miss! Indeed! I’ll take</p>
<p>Exquisite vengeance! Mark! I’ll spare thy life;</p>
<p>Thy boy’s too; both of you are free; on one</p>
<p>Condition.</p>
<p>Tell . Name it.</p>
<p>Ges . I would see you make</p>
<p>A trial of your skill with that same bow</p>
<p>You shoot so well with.</p>
<p>Tell . Name the trial you</p>
<p>Would have me make.</p>
<p>Ges . You look upon your boy</p>
<p>As though instinctively you guessed it.</p>
<p>Tell . Look upon my boy? What mean you? Look upon</p>
<p>My boy as though I guessed it? Guessed the trial</p>
<p>You’d have me make? Guessed it</p>
<p>Instinctively? You do not mean—no—no,</p>
<p>You would not have me make a trial of</p>
<p>My skill upon my child! Impossible!</p>
<p>I do not guess your meaning.</p>
<p>Ges . I would see</p>
<p>Thee hit an apple at the distance of</p>
<p>A hundred paces.</p>
<p>Tell . Is my boy to hold it?</p>
<p>Ges . No.</p>
<p>Tell . No? I’ll send the arrow through the core!</p>
<p>Ges . It is to rest upon his head.</p>
<p>Tell . Great heaven, you hear him!</p>
<p>Ges . Thou dost hear the choice I give:</p>
<p>Such trial of the skill thou art master of,</p>
<p>Or death to both of you, not otherwise</p>
<p>To be escaped.</p>
<p>Tell . O, monster!</p>
<p>Ges . Wilt thou do it?</p>
<p>Alb . He will! he will!</p>
<p>Tell . Ferocious monster! Make</p>
<p>A father murder his own child!</p>
<p>Ges . Take off his chains if he consent.</p>
<p>Tell . With his own hand!</p>
<p>Ges . Does he consent?</p>
<p>Alb . He does. ( Gesler signs to his officers, who proceed to take
off Tell’s</p>
<p>chains; Tell unconscious what they do. )</p>
<p>Tell . With his own hand!</p>
<p>Murder his child with his own hand? This hand?</p>
<p>The hand I’ve led him, when an infant, by?</p>
<p>’T is beyond horror! ’T is most horrible!</p>
<p>Amazement! ( His chains fall off. ) What’s that you’ve done to
me?</p>
<p>Villains! put on my chains again. My hands</p>
<p>Are free from blood, and have no gust [18] for it,</p>
<p>That they should drink my child’s! Here! here! I’ll</p>
<p>Not murder my boy for Gesler.</p>
<p>Alb . Father! Father!</p>
<p>You will not hit me, father!</p>
<p>Tell . Hit thee? Send</p>
<p>The arrow through thy brain? Or, missing that,</p>
<p>Shoot out an eye? Or, if thine eye escape,</p>
<p>Mangle the cheek I’ve seen thy mother’s lips</p>
<p>Cover with kisses? Hit thee? Hit a hair</p>
<p>Of thee, and cleave thy mother’s heart?</p>
<p>Ges . Dost thou consent?</p>
<p>Tell . Give me my bow and quiver.</p>
<p>Ges . For what?</p>
<p>Tell . To shoot my boy!</p>
<p>Alb . No, father, no!</p>
<p>To save me! You’ll be sure to hit the apple.</p>
<p>Will you not save me, father?</p>
<p>Tell . Lead me forth;</p>
<p>I’ll make the trial!</p>
<p>Alb . Thank you!</p>
<p>Tell . Thank me? Do</p>
<p>You know for what? I will not make the trial.</p>
<p>To take him to his mother in my arms!</p>
<p>And lay him down a corse before her!</p>
<p>Ges . Then he dies this moment, and you certainly</p>
<p>Do murder him whose life you have a chance</p>
<p>To save, and will not use it.</p>
<p>Tell . Well, I’ll do it; I’ll make the trial.</p>
<p>Alb . Father!</p>
<p>Tell . Speak not to me:</p>
<p>Let me not hear thy voice: thou must be dumb,</p>
<p>And so should all things be. Earth should be dumb;</p>
<p>And heaven—unless its thunders muttered at</p>
<p>The deed, and sent a bolt to stop! Give me</p>
<p>My bow and quiver!</p>
<p>Ges . When all’s ready.</p>
<p>Tell . Ready!—</p>
<p>I must be calm with such a mark to hit!</p>
<p>Don’t touch me, child!—Don’t speak to me!—Lead on!</p>

<p>詹姆斯·谢里登·诺尔斯（1784—1862），剧作家和演员，出生于爱尔兰科克。
1792年，他的父亲携家迁往伦敦。十四岁那年，谢里登创作了一部歌剧，题为《格里朗骑士》。
1798年，他去了都柏林，不久后就开始从事演员兼剧作者的职业生涯。
1835年，他访问美国。
1839年，英国政府授予他一份文学年金嘉奖，每年可领取两百英镑。后来，诺尔斯离开舞台，成为一个浸信会的牧师，任职数年后去世。诺尔斯最负盛名的戏剧作品包括《凯厄斯·格拉古斯》、《弗吉尼亚斯》、《吉卜赛人里尔》、《驼背者》以及《威廉·泰尔》，以下两篇课文节选自《威廉·泰尔》。</p>
<p>（第一幕：城堡内一处房间。盖斯勒、众官吏、萨勒姆，以及戴着镣铐并由卫兵押解的泰尔上。）</p>
<p>萨勒姆：跪下，你这奴隶！看着老爷。跪下！快跪下，求老爷饶你性命！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：（坐下）他听见了吗？</p>
<p>萨勒姆：他听见了，但他无视您的威严。</p>
<p>官吏甲：瞧他那嘲讽的眼神，真想狠狠揍他一顿。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：天哪，我真不敢相信自己的眼睛：他竟然在笑！他竟抓着自己身上的铁链想要还击，瞧那架势，似乎要准备置人死地。（对泰尔）你为什么不说话？</p>
<p>泰尔：真是想不到。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：想不到什么？</p>
<p>泰尔：真想不到，你看起来不像个人。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：那我像什么？</p>
<p>泰尔：像个残忍的怪物。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：嘿！说话小心点！想想你身上的锁链。</p>
<p>泰尔：尽管你在我身上缠绕了双倍的锁链，它拖拽着我，几乎快将我压得趴在地上。但是，我不会趴下，我仍然会笔直地站着，不凭别的，就凭着我的尊严。我告诉你，你这卑劣的篡位者，我要一字一句地告诉你：你是个十足的怪物！想想我身上的锁链？你以为，这些锁链对我会有什么作用？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你竟敢质问我？</p>
<p>泰尔：你为什么不敢回答？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：我没听错，你竟敢质问我？</p>
<p>泰尔：你没听错。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：小心我报复？</p>
<p>泰尔：无非是个死。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：那就够了！难道死亡还不够可怕？</p>
<p>泰尔：不，死亡并不可怕。它不会摧毁生命的尊严，不会夺走美德带来的得体举止，不会压垮真理与良知，不会亵渎高尚的行为，不会剥夺优雅的谈吐。死亡做不到这些，正如它无法攫取，或是你们这些肮脏的手无法玷污太阳的光芒一样。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：但是，我会让你吃苦头的。</p>
<p>泰尔：当然。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：我还能让你痛苦呻吟。</p>
<p>泰尔：是的，我甚至还会大声哭喊，但是，即便这样，我也不会屈服。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你从哪里来？</p>
<p>泰尔：我从山里来，你听过从那里传来的消息吗？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：说给我听听。</p>
<p>泰尔：啊，那儿的人再也看不到雪崩了。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：什么意思？</p>
<p>泰尔：因为他们想抓你。但暴风雪袭来，他们始料未及，山脚下发生雪崩，将他们掩埋了。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：然后呢？</p>
<p>泰尔：老天有眼无珠，难道不是你的缘故！你心里充满了对他们阴暗的诅咒。赐在他们身上的，固然不是充满恩典的天堂，但你心里的恶毒念头——是能让一切枯萎的地狱。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：不错！我就是要让他们像他们家乡的山坡那样，无论夏天的林间多么繁茂，充满诱惑，他们也永远笑不出来。</p>
<p>泰尔：但他们还是经常说笑。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：哦，什么时候？</p>
<p>泰尔：当他们谈起复仇的时候。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：复仇？他们竟敢说复仇？</p>
<p>泰尔：是啊，不仅谈论，他们还满心期待。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：从哪里？</p>
<p>泰尔：从天堂里！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：从天堂里？</p>
<p>泰尔：那些山岭间的树木，就是他们高举起的双手，呼唤着血债血偿！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你住在哪儿？</p>
<p>泰尔：我告诉过你，住在山里。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你结婚了吗？</p>
<p>泰尔：是的。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：家里还有别的人吗？</p>
<p>泰尔：一个儿子。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：一个儿子？萨勒姆，过来！</p>
<p>萨勒姆：老爷，那个男孩——（盖斯勒示意萨勒姆别再说下去，对他耳语了几句，将他打发出去。）</p>
<p>泰尔：那个男孩？哪个男孩？我的儿子？他们竟然设计陷害我年幼无知的儿子！他们这样做，老天会开眼的！要是他在这里与我相认，这群恶徒一定不会放过他！只要一个警告的眼神，就能提醒他这点——但是，该怎么让他知道呢？我的心啊，镇定些，要像石头一样冷酷无情，这样他们才不会发现他是我的儿子！啊，他们来了，他们来了！这脚步声——这脚步声，这轻微的、细碎的脚步声，一步步重重践踏在我的心上！我的孩子！（萨勒姆带着阿尔伯特上，阿尔伯特眼睛紧紧盯着萨勒姆手上拿着的泰尔的弓弩。）天哪，真的是他！这下我们该怎么办？</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：（悄声对自己说）是的，我没看错，这正是我父亲的弓弩！那个男人就是我父亲！但我绝不能在这里与他相认。</p>
<p>萨勒姆：快看！</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：看什么？</p>
<p>萨勒姆：看那儿！</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：我正在看，可你想让我看什么？</p>
<p>萨勒姆：你的父亲。</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：谁？那个人——你说那个人是我父亲？</p>
<p>泰尔：我的孩子！我的孩子！我勇敢的好孩子！他是安全的。（悄声对自己说）</p>
<p>萨勒姆：（悄声对盖斯勒说）他们俩长得很像。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：但是，我可看不出丝毫破绽，他们俩一点儿都没有父子相认的意思。</p>
<p>萨勒姆：老爷，我敢保证他们俩一定是父子。看看他们，这男孩简直与他是一个模子里刻出来的！虽然他们俩只是冷冷地彼此打量，但这多半是他们事先想好的对策，故意不在这样的场合中相认。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：有道理，我们来查个究竟。去，将这混蛋带出去。</p>
<p>萨勒姆：去地牢？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：不，去法庭。</p>
<p>萨勒姆：老爷，法庭吗？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：对，让刀斧手做好准备。快去！告诉他们，我们要处死这个奴隶！你注意到那孩子的表情了吗？</p>
<p>萨勒姆：是的，老爷。他很吃惊，可见这家伙就是他的父亲。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：我们等着瞧吧。把他带走！</p>
<p>泰尔：慢着！慢着！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你要做什么？</p>
<p>泰尔：给我点时间——给我点时间，让我想一下！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你没有时间了。</p>
<p>泰尔：我有话要说。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：把他给我带走！</p>
<p>泰尔：慢着，住手！让我跟那孩子说句话吧。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：他是你儿子？</p>
<p>泰尔：如果他是我儿子，你们难道如此丧心病狂，竟让我在他面前被处死？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：哼，好吧。你去跟他说话吧。萨勒姆，你可要看好他俩咯。</p>
<p>泰尔：孩子，你不认识我，这对你来说，是件好事。我有个儿子，和你差不多大。我能看出，你和他一样，都是来自大山的孩子。如果你能逃出这里，以后也许能见到他。如果你们能见面，我请求你告诉他这里曾发生的事情，请告诉他，我将我的手抚摸着你的脑袋，并对你说：如果他现在像你这样正站在我面前，我愿上帝保佑他。我的孩子，愿你好好活着，为你的祖国而战斗，直到她获得自由，或是为她战死，像我这样！（阿尔伯特哭泣。）</p>
<p>萨勒姆：快看！那孩子在哭。</p>
<p>泰尔：如果他是我儿子，他绝不会流一滴眼泪！他会记得那养育他长大的悬崖峭壁，在那里，他曾学会看清遥远山脚下的东西，学会倾听雷声的轰鸣，曾亲眼见到闪电。当我最后一次与他交谈，我曾对他说，死亡将最珍贵的宝石馈赠给人，令生命绽放出光芒。为了尊严，拥抱死亡吧。那时，他哭了！现在，如果他在这里，我要告诉他，他的面颊不应该苍白，他的眼睛不应该蒙上泪水，我要告诉他——</p>
<p>萨勒姆：那孩子在发抖！</p>
<p>泰尔：我说得太多了！但我必须这么做。我要对他说——</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你还想说什么？</p>
<p>泰尔：说说他的母亲，你这暴君，你让一个女人成为寡妇！我要对他说说他的母亲，我要让他转告她，在我临死时，除了自由之外，她的名字是我的嘴唇发出的唯一声音。我还要让他发誓，永远爱她、珍惜她，因为他父亲临死时将所有的希望都寄予他身上！</p>
<p>萨勒姆：快看，他颤抖地说着，那孩子颤抖地听着。</p>
<p>泰尔：他竟承受得这么好，他真令我骄傲。哦，我的孩子！我的孩子！啊，那些山岭，那些山岭，真希望能再看到他自由自在地在山间奔跑玩耍。</p>
<p>萨勒姆：快看他的眼神，他看起来难道不像个父亲？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：但他还是没与那孩子相认，这有违天性。</p>
<p>萨勒姆：要是他相信，一旦与孩子相认，就会令孩子与他一起送死，那他这么做就很正常了。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：有道理，我倒忘了这一茬！好吧，哪怕这男孩不是你儿子，但我决定让他和你一起去死。</p>
<p>泰尔：和我一起死？为什么？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：因为他冒犯了我的威严，正如你的所作所为一样，把他们带走！</p>
<p>泰尔：他只不过是个孩子！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：把他们带走！</p>
<p>泰尔：他可能是父母膝下的独子！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：那又怎样？</p>
<p>泰尔：他或许还有个母亲。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：毒蛇也有母亲，但谁又会为此放过它？</p>
<p>泰尔：你们真是铁石心肠！丧尽天良！罢了，罢了，我不用再求你了。过来，我的孩子。我曾教你怎样活着，我也将教你该如何死去。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：他真是你的孩子？</p>
<p>泰尔：他是我的孩子。（哭泣）</p>
<p>盖斯勒：我终于从他那儿榨出眼泪来了！你叫什么名字？</p>
<p>泰尔：我的名字？现在再瞒着你也没用了，我叫泰尔。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：泰尔？威廉·泰尔？</p>
<p>泰尔：没错。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：什么！你，你竟然是那个大名鼎鼎，在暴风雨袭击的大湖上领着人们逃出一死的威廉·泰尔？他们都说你箭无虚发，百发百中！原来竟是你！太好了，我要来次完美的复仇！你听着！我将赦免你，还有你的儿子，饶你们一死。只要你能满足我一个条件。</p>
<p>泰尔：你说吧。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：都说你射出的箭百发百中，我想看你用这支弓弩露一手。</p>
<p>泰尔：说吧，你想让我做什么？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你看了一眼你的孩子，你的直觉还真准。</p>
<p>泰尔：看了一眼我的孩子？你这是什么意思？看了一眼我的孩子，我就能猜对？我就能猜出你想让我做的事？天哪，你的意思该不会是——不，不，你不能让我用自己的孩子来证明我的箭术！绝不可能！我猜不出你想让我怎么做。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：我想看看，你是否能在一百步之外射中一个苹果。</p>
<p>泰尔：我儿子手里拿着苹果？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：不。</p>
<p>泰尔：不是这样？那么，我会射穿苹果的果核。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：苹果要放在你儿子的头上。</p>
<p>泰尔：万能的主啊，听听他究竟说了什么！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：这就是我为你开出的条件：用这个方法向我证明你的箭术，否则，你俩都得死，没有第三种选择。</p>
<p>泰尔：天哪，你这个畜生！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你不愿试一下？</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：愿意！他会愿意的！</p>
<p>泰尔：你这个残忍的魔鬼！你竟想让一个父亲谋杀自己的独子！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：如果你愿意，我就让人解开你的镣铐。</p>
<p>泰尔：这不是亲手谋杀吗！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你到底愿不愿意？</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：他愿意。（盖斯勒示意卫兵，卫兵上前解开泰尔的镣铐。泰尔对他们的行为茫然不知。）</p>
<p>泰尔：亲手谋杀！亲手谋杀自己的孩子？用我这双手？这双从他小时候我就开始抱着他、牵着他的手？这简直难以想象！还有比这更残暴无耻的事情吗？真难以置信！（他的镣铐被解下了。）你们对我做了什么？你们这群混蛋！把我的镣铐戴上！我的这双手从未沾染过鲜血，也从来不想这么做，而你们现在竟然要我亲手杀死我的儿子！这双手！这双手！我绝不会为盖斯勒那畜生杀害我的儿子！</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：爸爸！爸爸！您不会射中我的，爸爸！</p>
<p>泰尔：射中？射出的箭能穿透你的脑袋？偏一点，就可能射中你的眼睛；哪怕侥幸没射到眼睛，也可能擦伤你的脸颊，哦，我曾多少次看到你母亲亲吻你的那张小嘴！射中你？哪怕是擦过你的一根头发，都会令你母亲心碎！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你到底决定了没有？</p>
<p>泰尔：把我的弓和箭袋给我。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：干嘛？</p>
<p>泰尔：来射向我的儿子！</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：不，爸爸，不是的！是为了救我！您一定会射中苹果的。您难道不想救我吗，爸爸？</p>
<p>泰尔：带我到院子里去，我接受这个挑战！</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：谢谢，爸爸！</p>
<p>泰尔：谢我？你谢我什么？不，我不会这么做。我不会用这双手抱着我的孩子，走向他母亲，然后在她面前，放下她儿子的尸体！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你要是不肯，他现在就得死。你确实在谋害你的儿子，不过，你还有一次机会救他，试还是不试？</p>
<p>泰尔：好，我接受，我接受这个挑战。</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：爸爸！</p>
<p>泰尔：不要再跟我说话！别让我再听到你的声音：你必须像哑巴一样一声不吭，周围不能有哪怕丁点声音。大地必须装聋作哑，而苍天——除非苍天为这样的暴行而愤怒，送下一道闪电来停止这罪恶！把我的弓和箭袋给我！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你准备好了？</p>
<p>泰尔：是的！我必须冷静，才能射中靶心！别碰我，孩子！——也别跟我说话！坚持住！</p>

<p>WILLIAM TELL （CONCLUDED）</p>
<p>威廉·泰尔 （下）</p>
<p>SCENE 2.— Enter slowly, people in evident distress—Officers,
Sarnem,</p>
<p>Gesler, Tell, Albert, and soldiers—one bearing Tell’s bow and</p>
<p>quiver—another with a basket of apples.</p>
<p>Ges . That is your ground. Now shall they measure thence</p>
<p>A hundred paces. Take the distance.</p>
<p>Tell . Is the line a true one?</p>
<p>Ges . True or not, what is ’t to thee?</p>
<p>Tell . What is ’t to me? A little thing.</p>
<p>A very little thing; a yard or two</p>
<p>Is nothing here or there—were it a wolf</p>
<p>I shot at! Never mind.</p>
<p>Ges . Be thankful, slave,</p>
<p>Our grace accords [1] thee life on any terms.</p>
<p>Tell . I will be thankful, Gesler! Villain, stop!</p>
<p>You measure to the sun.</p>
<p>Ges . And what of that?</p>
<p>What matter whether to or from the sun?</p>
<p>Tell . I’d have it at my back. The sun should shine</p>
<p>Upon the mark, and not on him that shoots.</p>
<p>I can not see to shoot against the sun:</p>
<p>I will not shoot against the sun!</p>
<p>Ges . Give him his way! Thou hast cause to bless my mercy.</p>
<p>Tell . I shall remember it. I’d like to see</p>
<p>The apple I’m to shoot at.</p>
<p>Ges . Stay! show me the basket! there!</p>
<p>Tell . You’ve picked the smallest one.</p>
<p>Ges . I know I have.</p>
<p>Tell . Oh, do you? But you see</p>
<p>The color of it is dark: I’d have it light,</p>
<p>To see it better.</p>
<p>Ges . Take it as it is;</p>
<p>Thy skill will be the greater if thou hitt’st it.</p>
<p>Tell . True! true! I did not think of that; I wonder</p>
<p>I did not think of that. Give me some chance</p>
<p>To save my boy!—</p>
<p>I will not murder him,</p>
<p>If I can help it—for the honor of</p>
<p>The form thou wearest, if all the heart is gone.</p>
<p>( Throws away the apple with all his force .)</p>
<p>Ges . Well: choose thyself.</p>
<p>Tell . Have I a friend among the lookers-on?</p>
<p>Verner . ( Rushing forward .) Here, Tell.</p>
<p>Tell . I thank thee, Verner!</p>
<p>He is a friend runs out into a storm</p>
<p>To shake a hand with us. I must be brief.</p>
<p>When once the bow is bent, we can not take</p>
<p>The shot too soon. Verner, whatever be</p>
<p>The issue [2] of this hour, the common cause</p>
<p>Must not stand still. Let not tomorrow’s sun</p>
<p>Set on the tyrant’s banner! Verner! Verner!</p>
<p>The boy! the boy! Thinkest thou he hath the courage</p>
<p>To stand it?</p>
<p>Ver . Yes.</p>
<p>Tell . Does he tremble?</p>
<p>Ver . No.</p>
<p>Tell . Art sure?</p>
<p>Ver . I am.</p>
<p>Tell . How looks he?</p>
<p>Ver . Clear and smilingly.</p>
<p>If you doubt it, look yourself.</p>
<p>Tell . No, no, my friend:</p>
<p>To hear it is enough.</p>
<p>Ver . He bears himself so much above his years—</p>
<p>Tell . I know! I know!</p>
<p>Ver . With constancy so modest—</p>
<p>Tell . I was sure he would—</p>
<p>Ver . And looks with such relying love</p>
<p>And reverence upon you—</p>
<p>Tell . Man! Man! Man!</p>
<p>No more! Already I’m too much the father</p>
<p>To act the man! Verner, no more, my friend!</p>
<p>I would be flint—flint—flint. Don’t make me feel</p>
<p>I’m not—do not mind me! Take the boy</p>
<p>And set him, Verner, with his back to me.</p>
<p>Set him upon his knees, and place this apple</p>
<p>Upon his head, so that the stem may front me.</p>
<p>Thus, Verner; charge him to keep steady; tell him</p>
<p>I’ll hit the apple! Verner, do all this</p>
<p>More briefly than I tell it thee.</p>
<p>Ver . Come, Albert! ( Leading him out .)</p>
<p>Alb . May I not speak with him before I go?</p>
<p>Ver . No.</p>
<p>Alb . I would only kiss his hand.</p>
<p>Ver . You must not.</p>
<p>Alb . I must; I can not go from him without.</p>
<p>Ver . It is his will you should.</p>
<p>Alb . His will, is it?</p>
<p>I am content, then; come.</p>
<p>Tell . My boy! ( Holding out his arms to him .)</p>
<p>Alb . My father! ( Rushing into Tell’s arms .)</p>
<p>Tell . If thou canst bear it, should not I? Go now,</p>
<p>My son; and keep in mind that I can shoot;</p>
<p>Go, boy; be thou but steady, I will hit</p>
<p>The apple. Go! God bless thee; go. My bow!</p>
<p>( The bow is handed to him .)</p>
<p>Thou wilt not fail thy master, wilt thou? Thou</p>
<p>Hast never failed him yet, old servant. No,</p>
<p>I’m sure of thee. I know thy honesty,</p>
<p>Thou art stanch [3] , stanch. Let me see my quiver.</p>
<p>Ges . Give him a single arrow.</p>
<p>Tell . Do you shoot?</p>
<p>Soldier . I do.</p>
<p>Tell . Is it so you pick an arrow, friend?</p>
<p>The point, you see, is bent; the feather, jagged [4] .</p>
<p>That’s all the use ’t is fit for. ( Breaks it. )</p>
<p>Ges . Let him have another.</p>
<p>Tell . Why, ’t is better than the first,</p>
<p>But yet not good enough for such an aim</p>
<p>As I’m to take. ’T is heavy in the shaft [5] ;</p>
<p>I’ll not shoot with it! ( Throws it away. ) Let</p>
<p>me see my quiver.</p>
<p>Bring it! ’T is not one arrow in a dozen</p>

<p>（第二幕：众人看起来情绪都很沮丧，缓慢地走进。众官吏、萨勒姆、盖斯勒、泰尔、阿尔伯特及士兵们上。其中一名士兵手里拿着泰尔的弓弩和箭袋，另一名士兵拿着一篮苹果。）</p>
<p>盖斯勒：那是你站的地方。现在，卫兵们会从这里丈量出一百步，你儿子就站在一百步开外的地方。</p>
<p>泰尔：这条线可靠吗？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：可不可靠，对你来说又有什么关系？</p>
<p>泰尔：对我来说有什么关系？是啊，没什么关系。这只是一件小事，差了一两码，实在算不上什么——要是我射的是一只狼的话！算了，我真是白费唇舌。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：要心怀感恩，你这奴才。要知道，我们是在对你施以恩典。</p>
<p>泰尔：哦，我会记住的，盖斯勒！住手，你这混蛋！你在朝着太阳丈量。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：又怎么啦？朝着太阳或背对太阳有什么区别？</p>
<p>泰尔：我得背对太阳。太阳应该照在目标上，而不是照射在射箭者的脸上。迎着光线怎么行，我绝不能迎着太阳射箭！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：按他说的做吧！你该感激我的慈悲。</p>
<p>泰尔：我会记下的，我还想看看待会儿我要射的苹果。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你等着。把果篮拿过来给我看看！就这个吧！</p>
<p>泰尔：你挑了个最小的。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：是啊，我知道。</p>
<p>泰尔：噢，你知道？但是你看，这个苹果颜色太暗了。我想要个颜色鲜艳点的，才能看得更清楚。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：就这个吧。要是你射中了，岂不是说明你本事更大？</p>
<p>泰尔：是啊，是啊！我没想过这点，真有趣，我竟然没想过这点。给我些机会，让我救救我的孩子！——我绝不能杀了他，为此我什么都愿意做。看在你身上穿的这件华贵衣服的份儿上，哪怕底下已没有心，多给我些机会！（使尽全力将那苹果扔出。）</p>
<p>盖斯勒：好吧，你自己挑吧。</p>
<p>泰尔：这里有人能帮我吗？</p>
<p>弗纳：（冲上前。）我可以帮忙，泰尔。</p>
<p>泰尔：谢谢你，弗纳！你是一位冲进暴风雨里来帮助我们的朋友。这里，我必须简短说些需要注意的事。一旦我拉弯了弓，我还不能随即放箭。弗纳，问题的关键在于，箭靶必须站在原地，一动不动。哦，但愿这暴君的旗帜再也见不到明天的太阳！弗纳，弗纳！我的孩子！我的孩子！你觉得他有勇气一动不动地站在那儿吗？</p>
<p>弗纳：是的。</p>
<p>泰尔：他在颤抖吗？</p>
<p>弗纳：不。</p>
<p>泰尔：你确定？</p>
<p>弗纳：我确定。</p>
<p>泰尔：他看起来怎样？</p>
<p>弗纳：他的脸色平静，带着微笑。如果你不信，你可以自己看。</p>
<p>泰尔：不，不，我的朋友，听到这些已经够了。</p>
<p>弗纳：这些年，这孩子吃过很多苦，表现得不像是他这个年龄的孩子——</p>
<p>泰尔：我知道！我知道！</p>
<p>弗纳：他一直都那么谦逊与坚定——</p>
<p>泰尔：我知道他会是这样——</p>
<p>弗纳：他看着你，用全心依赖和景仰的眼神看着你——</p>
<p>泰尔：天哪！天哪！天哪！够了！父爱令我软弱，我要保持冷酷无情！弗纳，别再说了，我的朋友！我要坚定——要坚定，要坚定。别再说这样的话，令我软弱——别管我了！带走那个男孩，帮他在指定位置上站好，弗纳，让他的背朝着我。让他跪下，将这个苹果放在他的头上，这样我只能看到他的背。弗纳，让他稳稳地保持姿势，一动也别动。告诉他：我一定会射中这个苹果！弗纳，去吧，别做什么多余的事。</p>
<p>弗纳：过来，阿尔伯特！（领他走出。）</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：我离开前，能跟他说说话吗？</p>
<p>弗纳：不能。</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：我只想亲亲他的手。</p>
<p>弗纳：你不能这么做。</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：我必须这么做，如果不让我这么做，我就不走。</p>
<p>弗纳：这是你父亲的意思。</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：这是他的意思？好吧，那我愿意，走吧。</p>
<p>泰尔：我的孩子！（向孩子伸出胳膊。）</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：爸爸！（飞奔过来，扑进泰尔的怀里。）</p>
<p>泰尔：如果你能承受这样的痛苦，我难道就不应该坚持吗？去吧，我的孩子，相信我的箭术。去吧，孩子，稳稳地保持姿势，一动也别动。我一定会射中那苹果。去吧！上帝保佑你，去吧。拿我的弓来！（卫兵将弓递给他。）弓箭啊，你绝不会让你的主人失望，是吧？你还从未令我失望过，我的老伙计。从未。我相信你，相信你的忠诚。你很结实，很结实。把我的箭袋拿来。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：给他一支箭。</p>
<p>泰尔：你射箭吗？</p>
<p>士兵：是的。</p>
<p>泰尔：既然你射箭，那你为什么挑了这么一支箭给我？你看看，这柄箭的箭头已经弯了，箭羽也参差不齐。它只配被用来这么做。（将箭折断。）</p>
<p>盖斯勒：再给他一支箭。</p>
<p>泰尔：这就对了，这支看起来比第一支好些。但是，要让我射中苹果，这支箭还不够好。它的箭杆太沉，我绝不用这样的箭！（将箭远远扔开。）让我看看我的箭袋。拿过来！一打箭里，往往找不出一支像样的好箭来射中一只鸽子，而苹果又比鸽子小得多！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：好吧，把箭袋给他。</p>
<p>泰尔：去看看孩子准备好了没有。（泰尔悄悄将一支箭藏进外衣。）</p>
<p>弗纳：孩子准备好了。</p>
<p>泰尔：（对周围人说道）我也准备好了！老天在上，所有人都保持安静，千万别弄出一丁点儿声响。为我祈祷吧，为我祈祷，并为我见证，虽然他的安危悬在我的手上，但这是我唯一能够拯救他的机会。</p>
<p>盖斯勒：开始吧。</p>
<p>泰尔：好。哦，朋友们，请发发慈悲，所有人都别动，务必安静。（泰尔开弓射击。人群中发出震耳欲聋的欢呼声。泰尔的头耷拉胸前，他费了好大力气，才扶住弓弩站住。）</p>
<p>弗纳：（带着阿尔伯特冲了过来。）孩子没事，毫发无伤！</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：爸爸，我没事。您的阿尔伯特一点事都没有，我亲爱的爸爸。您听见了吗？快说话呀！</p>
<p>弗纳：孩子，他现在还说不出话。</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：先生，您饶恕他的性命了？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：是的。</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：所以，我和爸爸都自由了？</p>
<p>盖斯勒：是的。（暗中极为气愤。）</p>
<p>阿尔伯特：快解开他的外衣，让他喘喘气。（阿尔伯特解开他父亲的外衣，那支箭掉下来。泰尔回过神来，定睛望着阿尔伯特，一把将他搂在胸前。）</p>
<p>泰尔：我的儿子！我的儿子！</p>
<p>盖斯勒：你在胸口藏那支箭做什么？说，你这奴才！</p>
<p>泰尔：要是我失手射死了我儿子，这支箭就留给你这个暴君！</p>

<p>THE CRAZY ENGINEER</p>
<p>疯狂的火车司机</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>My train left Dantzic in the morning generally about eight
o’clock; but once a week we had to wait for the arrival of the steamer
from Stockholm. It was the morning of the steamer’s arrival that I came
down from the hotel, and found that my engineer had been so seriously
injured that he could not perform his work. I went immediately to the
engine house to procure another engineer, for I supposed there were
three or four in reserve there, but I was disappointed.</p></li>
<li><p>I heard the puffing of the steamer, and the passengers would be
on hand in fifteen minutes. I ran to the guards and asked them if they
knew where there was an engineer, but they did not. I then went to the
firemen and asked them if any one of them felt competent [1] to run the
engine to Bromberg. No one dared to attempt it. The distance was nearly
one hundred miles. What was to be done?</p></li>
<li><p>The steamer stopped at the wharf, and those who were going on by
rail came flocking to the station. They had eaten breakfast on board the
boat, and were all ready for a fresh start. The train was in readiness
in the long station house, and the engine was steaming and puffing away
impatiently in the distant firing house.</p></li>
<li><p>It was past nine o’clock. “Come, why don’t we start?” growled an
old, fat Swede, who had been watching me narrowly for the last fifteen
minutes. And upon this there was a general chorus of anxious inquiry,
which soon settled to downright murmuring. At this juncture [2] some one
touched me on the elbow. I turned, and saw a stranger by my side. I
thought that he was going to remonstrate [3] with me for my
backwardness. In fact, I began to have strong temptations to pull off my
uniform, for every anxious eye was fixed upon the glaring badges which
marked me as the chief officer of the train.</p></li>
<li><p>However, this stranger was a middle-aged man, tall and stout,
with a face of great energy and intelligence. His eye was black and
brilliant,—so brilliant that I could not gaze steadily into it, though I
tried; and his lips, which were very thin, seemed more like polished
marble than human flesh. His dress was black throughout, and not only
set with exact nicety, but was scrupulously clean and neat.</p></li>
<li><p>“You want an engineer, I understand,” he said in a low, cautious
tone, at the same time gazing quietly about him, as though he wanted no
one to hear what he said.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“I do,” I replied. “My train is all ready, and we have no engineer
within twenty miles of this place.”</p>
<p>“Well, sir, I am going to Bromberg; I must go, and I will run the
engine for you.”</p>
<p>“Ha!” I uttered, “are you an engineer?”</p>
<p>“I am, sir—one of the oldest in the country—and am now on my way to
make arrangements for a great improvement I have invented for the
application of steam to a locomotive. My name is Martin Kroller. If you
wish, I will run as far as Bromberg; and I will show you running that is
running.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Was I not fortunate? I determined to accept the man’s offer at
once, and so I told him. He received my answer with a nod and a smile. I
went with him to the house, where we found the engine in charge of the
fireman, and all ready for a start. Kroller got upon the platform, and I
followed him. I had never seen a man betray such a peculiar aptness [4]
amid machinery as he did. He let on the steam in an instant, but yet
with care and judgment, and he backed up to the baggage carriage with
the most exact nicety.</p></li>
<li><p>I had seen enough to assure me that he was thoroughly acquainted
with the business, and I felt composed [5] once more. I gave my engine
up to the new man, and then hastened away to the office. Word was passed
for all the passengers to take their seats, and soon afterward I waved
my hand to the engineer. There was a puff, a groaning of the heavy
axletrees, a trembling of the building, and the train was in motion. I
leaped upon the platform of the guard carriage, and in a few minutes
more the station house was far behind us.</p></li>
<li><p>In less than an hour we reached Dirschau, where we took up the
passengers, that had come on the Konigsberg railway. Here I went forward
and asked Kroller how he liked the engine. He replied that he liked it
very much. “But,” he added, with a strange sparkling of the eye, “wait
until I get my improvement, and then you will see traveling. Why, I
could run an engine of my construction to the moon in four and twenty
hours?”</p></li>
<li><p>I smiled at what I thought his enthusiasm, and then went back to
my station. As soon as the Konigsberg passengers were all on board, and
their baggage carriage attached, we started on again. Soon after, I went
into the guard carriage and sat down. An early train from Konigsberg had
been through two hours before, and was awaiting us at Little Oscue,
where we took on board the Western mail.</p></li>
<li><p>“How we go,” uttered one of the guards, some fifteen minutes
after we had left Dirschau. “The new engineer is trying the speed,” I
replied, not yet having any fear. But ere long I began to apprehend [6]
he was running a little too fast. The carriages began to sway to and
fro, and I could hear exclamations of fright from the passengers. “Good
heavens!” cried one of the guards, coming in at that moment, “what is
that fellow doing? Look, sir, and see how we are going.”</p></li>
<li><p>I looked at the window, and found that we were dashing along at a
speed never before traveled on that road. Posts, fences, rocks, and
trees flew by in one undistinguished mass, and the carriages now swayed
fearfully. I started to my feet, and met a passenger on the platform. He
was one of the chief owners of our road, and was just on his way to
Berlin. He was pale and excited.</p></li>
<li><p>“Sir,” he gasped, “is Martin Kroller on the engine?”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Yes,” I told him.</p>
<p>“What! didn’t you know him?”</p>
<p>“Know?” I repeated, somewhat puzzled; “what do you mean? He told me
his name was Kroller, and that he was an engineer. We had no one to run
the engine, and—”</p>
<p>“You took him!” interrupted the man. “Good heavens, sir, he is as
crazy as a man can be! He turned his brain over a new plan for applying
steam power. I saw him at the station, but did not fully recognize him,
as I was in a hurry. Just now one of your passengers told me that your
engineers were all gone this morning, and that you found one that was a
stranger to you. Then I knew the man whom I had seen was Martin Kroller.
He had escaped from the hospital at Stettin. You must get him off
somehow.”</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p>The whole fearful truth was now open to me. The speed of the
train was increasing every moment, and I knew that a few more miles per
hour would launch us all into destruction. I called to the guard and
then made my way forward as quickly as possible. I reached the back
platform of the tender [7] , and there stood Kroller upon the engine
board, his hat and coat off, his long black hair floating wildly in the
wind, his shirt unbuttoned at the front, his sleeves rolled up, with a
pistol in his teeth, and thus glaring upon the fireman, who lay
motionless upon the fuel. The furnace was stuffed till the very latch of
the door was red-hot, and the whole engine was quivering and swaying as
though it would shiver to pieces.</p></li>
<li><p>“Kroller! Kroller’!” I cried, at the top of my voice. The crazy
engineer started, and caught the pistol in his hand. Oh, how those great
black eyes glared, and how ghastly and frightful the face
looked!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” he yelled demoniacally, glaring upon me like a roused
lion.</p>
<p>“They said that I could not make it! But see! see! See my new power!
See my new engine! I made it, and they are jealous of me! I made it, and
when it was done, they stole it from me. But I have found it! For years
I have been wandering in search of my great engine, and they said it was
not made. But I have found it! I knew it this morning when I saw it at
Dantzic, and I was determined to have it. And I’ve got it! Ho! ho! ho!
we’re on the way to the moon, I say! We’ll be in the moon in four and
twenty hours. Down, down, villain! If you move, I’ll shoot you.”</p>
<p>This was spoken to the poor fireman, who at that moment attempted to
rise, and the frightened man sank back again.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p>“Here’s Little Oscue just before us,” cried out one of the guard.
But even as he spoke, the buildings were at hand. A sickening sensation
settled upon my heart, for I supposed that we were now gone. The houses
flew by like lightning. I knew if the officers here had turned the
switch as usual, we should be hurled into eternity in one fearful crash.
I saw a flash,—it was another engine,—I closed my eyes; but still we
thundered on! The officers had seen our speed, and knowing that we would
not be able to stop, in that distance, they had changed the switch, so
that we went forward.</p></li>
<li><p>But there was sure death ahead, if we did not stop. Only fifteen
miles from us was the town of Schwetz, on the Vistula; and at the rate
we were going we should be there in a few minutes, for each minute
carried us over a mile. The shrieks of the passengers now rose above the
crash of the rails, and more terrific than all else arose the demoniac
yells of the mad engineer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Merciful heavens!” gasped the guardsman, “there’s not a moment to
lose;</p>
<p>Schwetz is close. But hold,” he added; “let’s shoot him.”</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li><p>At that moment a tall, stout German student came over the
platform where we stood, and saw that the madman had his heavy pistol
aimed at us. He grasped a huge stick of wood, and, with a steadiness of
nerve which I could not have commanded, he hurled it with such force and
precision [8] that he knocked the pistol from the maniac’s hand. I saw
the movement, and on the instant that the pistol fell, I sprang forward,
and the German followed me. I grasped the man by the arm; but I should
have been nothing in his mad power, had I been alone. He would have
hurled me from the platform, had not the student at that moment struck
him upon the head with a stick of wood, which he caught as he came over
the tender.</p></li>
<li><p>Kroller settled down like a dead man, and on the next instant I
shut off the steam and opened the valve. As the free steam shrieked and
howled in its escape, the speed began to decrease, and in a few minutes
more the danger was passed. As I settled back, entirely overcome by the
wild emotions that had raged within me, we began to turn the river; and
before I was fairly recovered, the fireman had stopped the train in the
station house at Schwetz.</p></li>
<li><p>Martin Kroller, still insensible, was taken from the platform;
and, as we carried him to the guard room, one of the guard recognized
him, and told us that he had been there about two weeks before.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“He came,” said the guard, “and swore that an engine which stood near
by was his. He said it was one he had made to go to the moon in, and
that it had been stolen from him. We sent for more help to arrest him,
and he fled.”</p>
<p>“Well,” I replied, with a shudder, “I wish he had approached me in
the same way; but he was more cautious at Dantzic.”</p>
<p>At Schwartz we found an engineer to run the engine to Bromberg; and
having taken out the western mail for the next northern mail to carry
along, we saw that Kroller would be properly attended to, and then
started on.</p>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li>The rest of the trip we ran in safety, though I could see the
passengers were not wholly at ease, and would not be until they were
entirely clear of the railway. Martin Kroller remained insensible from
the effects of the blow nearly two weeks; and when he recovered from
that, he was sound again; his insanity was all gone. I saw him about
three weeks afterward, but he had no recollection of me. He remembered
nothing of the past year, not even his mad freak on my engine. But I
remembered it, and I remember it still; and the people need never fear
that I shall be imposed upon again by a crazy engineer.</li>

<h4 id="中文阅读-399">中文阅读</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>我的火车通常在早上八点左右离开丹兹克，每周仅一个班次，火车要等待从斯德哥尔摩出发的渡轮到来后才发车。这天早上，我们照旧要等渡轮到来。我走出酒店，发现原本当班的列车司机严重受伤，显然已不能正常工作。我立刻赶到机房，试图找一位司机顶班。那儿通常都有三四位机动司机，但最后我只有失望而归。</p></li>
<li><p>这时，我听到渡轮上发出的巨大汽笛声，下船的乘客们十五分钟内便会抵达车站。我向警卫处跑去，问他们是否知道哪里能找到火车司机，但没有人知道。我又跑去锅炉班，询问他们当中是否有人能充任司机，将火车一路开到布鲁姆伯格。大家面面相觑，无人敢试。从丹兹克到布鲁姆伯格距离将近一百英里，接下来该怎么办？</p></li>
<li><p>轮船已经泊靠码头，打算换乘火车的旅客们向火车站蜂拥而来。他们已经在船上吃完早餐，准备好迎接全新的一天。火车停靠在长长的车站前，车头停在远处锅炉班前面，冒着白烟，不耐烦地“噗噗——”吼着。</p></li>
<li><p>时间已过九点。“嗨，为什么还不出发？”一个肥胖的瑞典老男人冲我咆哮，他一直盯着我的一举一动，差不多直直盯了一刻钟。随后，周围响起一阵附和般的焦急质疑，很快便成了成群抱怨。这时，有人碰了碰我的手肘。我转过身，看见一位陌生人站在我身旁。我想，他大概也想为列车的晚点而冲我发火。事实上，我真想一把扯掉身上的制服，因为每双焦虑的眼睛都紧紧盯着我制服上那耀眼的列车长徽章。</p></li>
<li><p>这个陌生人是一名中年男子，身材高大壮实，看起来精力充沛，富有学识。他的眼眸黝黑深邃——深邃得让我无法长久凝视它，虽然我试图这么做。他的嘴唇很薄，看起来更像是抛光后的大理石。他全身上下一袭黑色，不但服装极为考究，做工细致，而且异常整洁笔挺。</p></li>
<li><p>“我知道，您需要一名列车司机。”他低低地对我说，语气谨慎，同时冷静地环顾着周围，似乎想确保没有人听见他说什么。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“是的，确实如此。”我回答道。“火车已经准备好了，但是方圆二十英里内我们却找不到一位司机。”</p>
<p>“噢，是这样，先生，我要去布鲁姆伯格。我必须要去，我可以为您开这趟车。”</p>
<p>“哈！”我不可置信地叫了一声，“你是列车司机吗？”</p>
<p>“当然，先生——我可是这个国家资格最老的司机之一，我正在从事研发一项将蒸汽用于火车头的重大改进。我的名字是马丁·克罗勒。如果你愿意，我可以将火车开到布鲁姆伯格，我会让你看到，什么才是真正的奔驰。”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>我未免也太走运了！我决定马上接受这个男人的帮助，因此便一口应允下来。他点点头，微笑着接受了我的允诺。接着，我带他去了机房，在那儿，当班的锅炉工已经将车头准备好了，随时可以出发。克罗勒登上机车驾驶厢，我跟在他身后。我还从未见过其他人曾像他那样具有非凡的机器掌控才能。他检查了蒸汽阀，动作虽然迅捷，但态度却很谨慎，富于判断力。接着，他又到列车后部，仔仔细细地检查了行李车厢。</p></li>
<li><p>我看着他的举动，心里如释重负：他确实知道该怎么做。我终于安下心来，感到踏实多了。于是，我便将车头运行大权交予这位新人，然后匆忙离开赶去办公室。广播响起，嘱咐所有乘客回到座位做好；随后，我便向这位新司机招手示意，表示可以开车了。火车头“噗噗——”地喷着白烟，笨重的火车轴轮开始发出刺耳的声音，车厢颤抖起来，火车终于启动了。我跳上警卫车厢的连接处，不过片刻，车站就已经远远消失在身后。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>9.不到一个钟头，火车便到达德肖站。停站后，上来一些旅客，下一站是柯尼斯堡站。我走到驾驶室，询问克罗勒对驾驶这辆列车的感觉如何。他回答说非常满意。</p>
<p>“不过，”他补充道，眼里闪着奇异的光泽，“等我改善了我的发明以后，你才知道什么叫真正的旅行。嘿，那时我就能用自己研发的引擎二十四小时内到达月球！”</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p>我笑了起来，心想，他可真够激情的。随后，我便返回车厢。等柯尼斯堡站的乘客全部上了车，行李车厢也和主车厢挂接完毕以后，火车又开动了。过了一会儿，我走进了警卫车厢，坐了下来。一趟从柯尼斯堡站出发的早班车两小时前刚刚通过，将会在小奥斯库站等着我们，在那里，我们会将从西边来的邮件装上列车。</p></li>
<li><p>从德肖站发车大概十五分钟后，一名警卫突然问道：“车速是不是有点太快了？”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“新的列车司机正在测速。”我顺口回答，没有任何异常感觉。但不多久，我的内心便开始隐隐不安，车速确实有点太快了。这时，车厢开始左右晃动，我甚至能听到旅客们发出恐惧的惊呼声。</p>
<p>“上帝啊！”一名警卫突然冲进来，大声叫着，“那家伙在干什么？快看，先生，火车开得有多快啊！”</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>我朝窗外望去，发现火车正以前所未有的速度在铁轨上飞驰着。标杆、栅栏、岩石和树木从窗外呼啸闪过，几乎无法看清，车厢摇摆愈发让人恐惧。我离开车厢，在过道里遇上一位乘客，他是这条铁路的大股东之一，正巧坐这趟列车去柏林。他脸色苍白，呼吸急促。</p></li>
<li><p>“先生，”他气喘吁吁地说，“难道是马丁·克罗勒在开车？”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“不错，正是他。”我对他说。</p>
<p>“什么！你难道不知道他？”</p>
<p>“知道他？”我下意识地重复着他的话，有些丈二和尚摸不着头脑，“这是什么意思？他跟我说，他叫马丁·克罗勒，是一名列车司机。我们当时正发愁找不到司机，所以——”</p>
<p>“所以你就让他来开！”这个男人打断了我的话，“上帝啊，先生，这家伙简直疯狂得不可理喻！他满脑子都是采用蒸汽动力的新计划。我在车站见到他了，但当时我太匆忙，没有完全认出他来。刚才，有一位乘客告诉我，说今天早上这趟车的列车司机们全都不在，而你找了一个陌生人来替代，我马上意识到，我在车站见到的那个人就是马丁·克罗勒，他从斯德汀的医院逃出来了。不论用什么办法，你必须让他马上离开驾驶室。”</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p>现在，整个可怕的事实真相已经摆在我面前。火车仍在分分秒秒加速，我清楚，每小时再提速不过数英里的列车就足以带着我们所有人下地狱。我叫了警卫，然后尽快赶去车头。我到达煤水车厢的后端连接处，看到克罗勒站在车头仪表盘旁边，他的帽子和外套都脱掉了，长长的黑发在风中狂乱飞舞，衬衫纽扣也松开了，袖口高高卷起，嘴里居然还衔着一把手枪。他瞪视着锅炉工，那位工人正一动不动地躺在燃料上。炉膛已经被塞得满满当当，就连炉门上的门闩都被烧得通红，整个火车头颤抖摇摆着，好像很快就要散架似的。</p></li>
<li><p>“克罗勒！克罗勒！”我声嘶力竭地叫着他。那名疯狂的司机愣了一下，把手枪拿在手里。天哪，他的眼睛死瞪着我，那张脸看起来那么阴森可怕！</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“哈！哈！哈！”他歇斯底里地狂笑着，像一头醒狮瞪着猎物似的怒视着我。</p>
<p>“他们说我做不到！但是，看呀！看呀！看我这新的动力！看我这新的引擎！我做到了，他们是在嫉妒我！我做到了，当我完成的时候，他们从我手里偷走了它。但是现在，我终于把它造出来了！这么多年来，我一直在到处寻找我这台伟大的发动机，他们一直说它不可能被造出来。但我终于造出来了！今早我在丹兹克看到它的时候，我就下定决定要拥有它。我终于成功了！嗬嗬嗬！我宣布，我们现在正在去月球的路上！我们将在二十四小时内到达月球。趴下，趴下，你个混蛋！要是你敢再动一下，我就开枪。”</p>
<p>最后这句话是对可怜的锅炉工说的，他正试图站起来，受到惊吓后，又再度趴倒在地，不敢动弹。</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li><p>“小奥斯库站就在我们前方！”一名警卫高叫着。说时迟，车站建筑物也已经近在咫尺。我心里涌起一阵令人作呕的恶心感，以为这下我们死定了。房舍闪电般地从我们面前飞过。我知道，要是这个站点的调度员像以往那样扳动道岔，这趟列车势必撞上另一辆列车，我们会在一瞬间内彻底完蛋。我看见了一道闪光——那是另一辆列车的火车头——我不由得闭上双眼，但火车仍然飞速地向前疾驰着！调度员觉察到了我们这列火车的速度，从这段距离来看，很清楚这趟车不可能及时停止。因此，隔着老远，他们就改变了岔道，整辆火车才得以继续冲往前方。</p></li>
<li><p>即便这样，如果火车不停速的话，死亡的危险仍然在前方等待着我们。我们离维斯瓦河畔的施瓦茨镇只有十五英里了，火车目前的速度已经达到每分钟一英里以上，照这样的速度，我们用不了多久就会到达。乘客们的尖叫声现在已经压过铁轨剧烈的撞击声，但比这些声音更高亢的，是这名疯狂的列车司机魔鬼般的咆哮声。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“仁慈的上帝啊！”警卫倒吸了一口冷气，“我们没时间犹豫了，施瓦茨镇近在眼前。抓牢点，”他补充道，“我们枪击他。”</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li><p>就在那时，一名高大健壮的德国学生来到我们站立的车厢过道，他看到那个疯子正拿着那只沉重的手枪对准我们。他抓起一根长木棍，用一种我不具备的坚定胆量，用力地向那个疯子挥过去，准确地砸掉了他手中的枪。就在手枪掉下来的那一瞬间，我猛然向前扑去，那名德国人紧跟身后。我抓住那个疯子的胳膊，要是我孤身一人，我根本无法制服他的疯狂举动。那一刻，要不是那名学生从煤水车厢过来的时候，顺手抄起旁边的一根木根，狠狠击中克罗勒的脑袋，克罗勒很可能会将我用力摔出过道。</p></li>
<li><p>克罗勒像具尸体应声瘫倒在地，我即刻关掉了蒸汽开关，打开阀门。逸出的蒸汽尖锐地嘶叫着，火车开始慢慢地减速，几分钟后，危险排除了。我瘫倒在地，被刚才那些内心狂乱的情绪彻底击垮。这时，火车已经开过维斯瓦河谷，直到锅炉工将列车停在施瓦茨站的站台前，我都没能彻底回过神来。</p></li>
<li><p>马丁·克罗勒仍然不省人事，被抬下列车。当我们将他送到警卫室的时候，一名警卫认出了他，并告诉我们，大约两个星期前，克罗勒曾来过这里。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“他走过来，”警卫说，“指天发誓车站附近的那台火车头是他的。他说这是他造出来准备开往月球的车头，后来却被人从他那儿偷走了。我们动用了相当警力试图逮捕他，但他还是逃走了。”</p>
<p>“原来如此，”我回答道，心中仍然不寒而栗，“要是他当时也用同样的方式接近我，那该多好！但他在丹兹克表现得更加小心谨慎了。”</p>
<p>在施瓦茨车站，我们找到了一名列车司机，负责驾驶去布鲁姆伯格站的剩余路程。至于我们在小奥斯库站错过的那些从西边来的邮件，将会由下一趟从北边发车的列车捎来。我们看到克罗勒被妥善关照后，便重新上路了。</p>
<ol start="21" type="1">
<li>在剩下的路程中，火车开得相当安全平稳。但我能看到，乘客们并没有完全放下心来；不到他们彻底下车以后，他们大概都没法安心。马丁·克罗勒由于头部被重击失去知觉近两个星期，当他醒过来的时候，他的神智完全恢复了，精神也恢复正常。大约三个星期后，我再次见到他，但他丝毫不记得我，也记不起过去的事情，甚至包括那列火车上发生的所有荒诞行为。然而，我清清楚楚地记得，直到现在也仍然铭记于心。所有人都无须担心，我绝不会再任由一位疯狂的列车司机将这样的恐惧强加到他们身上。</li>

<p>James Russell Lowell (b. 1819, d.1891) was born in Cambridge, Mass.,
and was graduated from Harvard College [2] . He entered the profession
of law; but, in 1843, turned aside to publish “The Pioneer, a Literary
and Critical Magazine.” In 1855 he was appointed professor of
Belles-lettres in Harvard College. From 1877 to 1885 he was U.S.
Minister, first to Spain, afterwards to Great Britain. Lowell’s powers
as a writer were very versatile, and his poems range from the most
dreamy and imaginative to the most trenchant and witty. Among his most
noted poetical works are “The Biglow Papers,” “A Fable for Critics,”
“The Vision of Sir Launfal,” “The Cathedral,” and “The Legend of
Brittany;” while “Conversations on some of the Old Poets,” “Among my
Books,” and “My Study Windows,” place him in the front rank as an
essayist.</p>

<p>詹姆斯·罗素·洛威尔（1819—1891）出生于美国马萨诸塞州剑桥，毕业于哈佛学院。他最初从事律师职业，后于1843年转行，致力于出版《先锋者——文艺与批评杂志》。
1855年，他被任命为哈佛学院纯文学教授。
1877年至1885年，他担任美国大使，先是派驻西班牙，后来派驻英国。作为一名作家，洛威尔相当多才多艺，他的诗歌风格多样，囊括最为梦幻的丰富想象，不乏锐利尖刻的诙谐幽默，其中最负盛名的是《比格罗诗稿》、《写给批评家的寓言》、《郎弗尔爵士的梦》、《大教堂》以及《布蕾特尼的传说》。作品《与老诗人的对话》、《在我的书里》和《我书房的窗口》则使他跻身成为世界一流的散文家。</p>

<p>NO EXCELLENCE WITHOUT LABOR</p>
<p>没有汗水，怎有成功</p>
<p>William Wirt (b. 1772, d. 1834) was born in Bladensburg, Md. He was
admitted to the bar in 1799, and afterwards practiced law, with eminent
success, at Richmond and Norfolk, Va. He was one of the counsel for the
prosecution in the trial of Aaron Burr for treason. From 1817 to 1829 he
was attorney-general for the United States. In 1803 he published the
“Letters of a British Spy,” a work which attracted much attention, and
in 1817 a “Life of Patrick Henry.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The education, moral [1] and intellectual, of every individual,
must be chiefly his own work. Rely upon it that the ancients were right;
both in morals and intellect we give the final shape to our characters,
and thus become, emphatically, the architects [2] of our own fortune.
How else could it happen that young men, who have had precisely the same
opportunities, should be continually presenting us with such different
results, and rushing to such opposite destinies [3] ?</p></li>
<li><p>Difference of talent will not solve it, because that difference
is very often in favor of the disappointed candidate [4] . You will see
issuing from the walls of the same college, nay, sometimes from the
bosom of the same family, two young men, of whom one will be admitted to
be a genius [5] of high order, the other scarcely above the point of
mediocrity [6] ; yet you will see the genius sinking and perishing in
poverty, obscurity, and wretchedness; while, on the other hand, you will
observe the mediocre [7] plodding his slow but sure way up the hill of
life, gaining steadfast footing at every step, and mounting, at length,
to eminence and distinction, an ornament to his family, a blessing to
his country.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, whose work is this? Manifestly their own. They are the
architects of their respective [8] fortunes. The best seminary of
learning that can open its portals to you can do no more than to afford
you the opportunity of instruction; but it must depend, at last, on
yourselves, whether you will be instructed or not, or to what point you
will push your instruction.</p></li>
<li><p>And of this be assured, I speak from observation a certain truth:
THERE IS NO EXCELLENCE WITHOUT GREAT LABOR. It is the fiat [9] of fate,
from which no power of genius can absolve [10] you.</p></li>
<li><p>Genius, unexerted, is like the poor moth that flutters around a
candle till it scorches itself to death. If genius be desirable at all,
it is only of that great and magnanimous kind, which, like the condor
[11] of South America, pitches from the summit of Chimborazo, above the
clouds, and sustains itself at pleasure in that empyreal [12] region
with an energy rather invigorated than weakened by the effort.</p></li>
<li><p>It is this capacity for high and long-continued exertion, this
vigorous power of profound and searching investigation, this careering
[13] and wide-spreading comprehension of mind, and these long reaches of
thought, that</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,</p>
<p>Or dive into the bottom of the deep,</p>
<p>And pluck up drowned honor by the locks;”</p>
<p>this is the prowess [14] , and these the hardy achievements, which
are to enroll your names among the great men of the earth.</p>

<p>威廉·沃特（1772—1834）出生于美国马里兰州布莱登斯堡。
1799年，沃特取得律师执业资格，随后在弗吉尼亚州的里士满和诺福克执业，并颇负盛名，他在审判亚伦·伯尔叛国罪一案中担任控方律师之一。从1817年至1829年，他担任美国首席检察官。
1803年，沃特出版了《一名英国间谍的来信》，这部作品引起广泛关注；1817年，他的《帕特里克·亨利的一生》出版。</p>

<li><p>对于每个人来说，教育程度、道德感以及学识，都应该是他关注的主要对象。在这一点上，前人是正确的：通过道德与才智，我们为自己品性赋以最后定型，亦更为强调，我们才是自身命运的建筑师。除此之外，还有什么能解释那些拥有相同机遇的年轻人，却往往表现出不同的结果，并最终走向截然相反的终点？</p></li>
<li><p>天资上的差异无法解释这个问题，因为很多时候，禀赋略逊的人却拥有更好的结局。你经常能看到那些师出同门的同窗，或是来自同一个家庭的兄弟，两个年轻人，一个被公认为天赋异禀，另一个却只是平庸之辈。然而，你常常能看到那个天才逐渐沉沦泯于众人，贫穷窘困，处境悲惨；反倒是那个平庸的人，往往通过辛勤努力，缓慢而扎实地向前迈步，每一步都步履坚实，最终出类拔萃，成为家族的骄傲，国家的栋梁。</p></li>
<li><p>那么，原因究竟何在？很明显，成功在于自身努力。他们是各自不同命运的建筑师，为你开启通往世界的大门的一流学业教育只能给你提供一个塑造自己的机会，但是，你能否被塑造，或者在多大程度上能被塑造，最终只能依赖于你自身的努力。</p></li>
<li><p>而这一点，我可以向你保证。我所观察到的事实是，没有辛勤付出的汗水，就不会有成功。命运铁则旨在于此，没有任何天才可以逃逸或逃离其外。</p></li>
<li><p>不愿努力的天才，就像是追逐火光的可怜飞蛾，在蜡烛旁边不停拍动双翼，直到被烤焦焚死。如果这世上有值得称羡的天才，他就该是伟大而高尚的，像南美秃鹰，从钦博拉索山巅俯冲而下，然后高高地飞在云层之上，在凡人无法企及的高空中享受着恣意翱翔的乐趣，它们与生俱来的激情，被自身努力增强而不是削弱。</p></li>
<li><p>正是这种高强度的长期持续的努力，这种深远而不懈探询的充沛精力，这种迅疾的反应速度、开阔的思维方式，以及思考的深远程度，方能让人：</p></li>

<p>THE EXAMINATION</p>
<p>审查考试</p>
<p>Daniel Pierce Thompson (b. 1793, d. 1868) was born at Charles town,
Mass., but soon removed with his father to Vermont, where he lived until
twenty years of age, on a farm. His means of schooling were most
limited, but he was very ambitious and seized every opportunity. By his
own efforts he earned enough money to carry him through Middlebury
College, where he graduated in 1820. He then went to Virginia as private
tutor, and while there was entered at the bar. He shortly returned to
Vermont, and opened a law office in Montpelier. In time he was elected a
judge, and later secretary of state. From his college days Mr. Thompson
was a writer for the various magazines. Among his novels may be
mentioned “Locke Amsden, the Schoolmaster,” “May Martin, or the Money
Diggers,” “The Green Mountain Boys,” and “The Rangers, or the Tory’s
Daughter.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Have you any questions to ask me in the other branches, sir?” asked
Locke.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Not many,” replied Bunker. “There is reading, writing, grammar,
etc., which I know nothing about; and as to them, I must, of course,
take you by guess, which will not be much of a guess, after all, if I
find you have thought well on all other matters. Do you understand
philosophy?”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>“To what branch of philosophy do you allude, sir?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“To the only branch there is.”</p>
<p>“But you are aware that philosophy is divided into different kinds;
as, natural, moral, and intellectual [1] .”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! philosophy is philosophy, and means the study of the
reasons and causes of the things which we see, whether it be applied to
a crazy man’s dreams, or the roasting of potatoes. Have you attended to
it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, to a considerable extent, sir.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“I will put a question or two, then, if you please. What is the
reason of the fact, for it is a fact, that the damp breath of a person
blown on a good knife and on a bad one, will soonest disappear from the
well-tempered [2] blade?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“It may be owing to the difference in the polish of the two blades,
perhaps.” replied Locke.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>“Ah! that is an answer that don’t go deeper than the surface,”
rejoined Bunker, humorously. “As good a thinker as you evidently are,
you have not thought on this subject, I suspect. It took me a week, in
all, I presume, of hard thinking, and making experiments at a
blacksmith’s shop, to discover the reason of this. It is not the polish;
for take two blades of equal polish, and the breath will disappear from
one as much quicker than it does from the other, as the blade is better.
It is because the material of the blade is more compact [3] or less
porous [4] in one case than in the other.</p></li>
<li><p>“In the first place, I ascertained that the steel was made more
compact by being hammered and tempered, and that the better it was
tempered the more compact it would become; the size of the pores being
made, of course, less in the same proportion. Well, then, I saw the
reason I was in search of, at once. For we know a wet sponge is longer
in drying than a wet piece of green wood, because the pores of the first
are bigger. A seasoned or shrunk piece of wood dries quicker than a
green one, for the same reason.</p></li>
<li><p>“Or you might bore a piece of wood with large gimlet holes, and
another with small ones, fill them both with water, and let them stand
till the water evaporated [5] , and the difference of time it would take
to do this would make the case still more plain. So with the blades: the
vapor lingers longest on the worst wrought and tempered one, because the
pores, being larger, take in more of the wet particles, and require more
time in drying.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Your theory is at least a very ingenious [6] one,” observed
Locke, “and I am reminded by it of another of the natural phenomena [7]
, of the true explanation of which I have not been able to satisfy
myself. It is this: what makes the earth freeze harder and deeper under
a trodden path than the untrodden earth around it? All that I have
asked, say it is because the trodden earth is more compact. But is that
reason a sufficient one?”</p></li>
<li><p>“No,” said Bunker, “but I will tell you what the reason is, for I
thought that out long ago. You know that, in the freezing months, much
of the warmth we get is given out by the earth, from which, at intervals
[8] , if not constantly, to some extent, ascend the warm vapors to
mingle with and moderate the cold atmosphere above.</p></li>
<li><p>“Now these ascending streams of warm air would be almost wholly
obstructed by the compactness of a trodden path, and they would
naturally divide at some distance below it, and pass up through the
loose earth on each side, leaving the ground along the line of the path,
to a great depth beneath it, a cold, dead mass, through which the frost
would continue to penetrate, unchecked by the internal heat, which, in
its unobstructed ascent on each side, would be continually checking or
overcoming the frost in its action on the earth around.</p></li>
<li><p>“That, sir, is the true philosophy of the case, you may depend
upon it. But we will now drop the discussion of these matters; for I am
abundantly satisfied that you have not only knowledge enough, but that
you can think for yourself. And now, sir, all I wish to know further
about you is, whether you can teach others to think, which is half the
battle with a teacher. But as I have had an eye on this point, while
attending to the others, probably one experiment, which I will ask you
to make on one of the boys here, will be all I shall want.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Proceed, sir,” said the other.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>“Ay, sir,” rejoined Bunker, turning to the open fireplace, in
which the burning wood was sending up a column of smoke, “there, you see
that smoke rising, don’t you? Well, you and I know the, reason why smoke
goes upward, but my youngest boy does not, I think. Now take your own
way, and see if you can make him understand it.”</p></li>
<li><p>Locke, after a moment’s reflection, and a glance round the room
for something to serve for apparatus [9] , took from a shelf, where he
had espied a number of articles, the smallest of a set of cast-iron cart
boxes, as are usually termed the round hollow tubes in which the
axletree of a carriage turns. Then selecting a tin cup that would just
take in the box, and turning into the cup as much water as he judged,
with the box, would fill it, he presented them separately to the boy,
and said,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“There, my lad, tell me which of these is the heavier.”</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>“Why, the cart box, to be sure,” replied the boy, taking the cup,
half-filled with water, in one hand, and the hollow iron in the
other.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Then you think this iron is heavier than as much water as would fill
the place of it, do you?” resumed Locke.</p>
<p>“Why, yes, as heavy again, and more too—I know it is,” promptly said
the boy.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>“Well, sir, now mark what I do,” proceeded the former, dropping into
the cup the iron box, through the hollow of which the water instantly
rose to the brim of the vessel.</li>
</ol>
<p>“There, you saw that water rise to the top of the cup, did you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>
<p>“Very well, what caused it to do so?”</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>“Why, I know well enough, if I could only think: why, it is because
the iron is the heavier, and as it comes all around the water so it
can’t get away sideways, it is forced up.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“That is right; and now I want you to tell what makes that smoke rise
up the chimney.”</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>“Why,—I guess,” replied the boy, hesitating, “I guess,—I guess I
don’t know.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“Did you ever get up in a chair to look on some high shelf, so that
your head was brought near the ceiling of a heated room, in winter? and
did you notice any difference between the air up there and the air near
the floor?”</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>“Yes, I remember I have, and found the air up there as warm as
mustard; and when I got down, and bent my head near the floor to pick up
something, I found it as cold as could be.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“That is ever the case; but I wish you to tell me how the cold air
always happens to settle down to the lower part of the room, while the
warm air, somehow, at the same time, gets above.”</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li>“Why, why, heavy things settle down, and the cold air—yes, yes,
that’s it, I am sure—the cold air is heavier, and so settles down, and
crowds up the warm air.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“Very good. You then understand that cold air is heavier than the
heated air, as that iron is heavier than the water; so now we will go
back to the main question—what makes the smoke go upwards?”</p>
<ol start="19" type="1">
<li><p>“Oh! I see now as plain as day; the cold air settles down all
round, like the iron box, and drives up the hot air as fast as the fire
heats it, in the middle, like the water; and so the hot air carries the
smoke along up with it, just as feathers and things in a whirlwind.
Well! I have found out what makes smoke go up—is n’t it
curious?”</p></li>
<li><p>“Done like a philosopher!” cried Bunker. “The thing is settled. I
will grant that you are a teacher among a thousand. You can not only
think yourself, but can teach others to think; so you may call the
position yours as quick as you please.”</p></li>

<p>丹尼尔·皮尔斯·汤普森（1793—1868）出生在美国马萨诸塞州查尔斯顿，但很快便随着父亲迁往佛蒙特州的一个农场里，并在那里住到二十岁。汤普森所获教育很有限，但他胸怀大志，并善于抓住每个机会。通过自己的努力赚取足够费用后，他进入米德尔伯里学院学习。
1820年完成学业后，他前往弗吉尼亚州任家庭教师，并在那里获得律师执业资格。不久后，汤普森返回佛蒙特州，在蒙彼利埃并开了一家律师事务所。在后来的职业生涯里，他曾当选为法官，最终成为国务卿。从他的大学时代开始，汤普森先生便经常为各类杂志撰稿，他最值得一提的小说包括《洛克·阿姆斯登校长》、《梅·马丁，掘金者》、《大山里的男孩们》和《游侠们，或保守党人的女儿》。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“你还有什么其他学科的问题要问我吗，先生？”洛克问。</li>
</ol>
<p>“不多了，”邦克答道，“至于阅读、写作或语法之类，我是压根不懂的。如果问这些方面的问题，我就只能猜测你答得是否准确，但并不完全是猜测，毕竟，我可以从你的答案中发现你是否理性地思考过其他所有问题。你懂哲学吗？”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>“您指的是哪种哲学流派，先生？”</li>
</ol>
<p>“哲学仅有唯一流派。”</p>
<p>“但您知道，哲学分为不同的学术分支，包括自然哲学、精神哲学和知识性哲学。”</p>
<p>“胡说！哲学就是哲学，它是一门对我们所见事物背后的原因和逻辑进行分析的学科，不管是用在分析一个疯子的梦境上，还是烘培马铃薯上。你对这门学科有研究吗？”</p>
<p>“是的，学过很多，先生。”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“那么，如果你乐意的话，我想请教你一两个问题。当一个人朝一柄优质刀具和一柄劣质刀具上哈气的时候，优质刀具上潮湿空气的痕迹消失得更快。这是个客观事实，但这个事实背后的原因是什么？”</li>
</ol>
<p>“我想，这可能是因为两柄刀片抛光度的不同。”洛克回答道。</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>“哈！这答案不过涉及了皮毛。”邦克幽默地继续说道，“你显然是一位优秀的思想者，但是，我怀疑你并没有深入思考过这个问题。我花了整整一个星期思考这个问题，甚至去了铁匠铺里做了实验，以查明这个事实的原因。问题答案与抛光度不同没有关联，因为，即使你用两柄抛光度相同的刀片，分别往刀片上哈一口气，优质刀片上潮湿空气的痕迹消失得仍然比劣质刀片更快。这是因为，与劣质刀片相比，优质刀片的材质更紧密，缝隙更小。</p></li>
<li><p>“我首先确定的一点是，通过锻打淬火，钢材才能变得更密实。淬火处理得越好，钢材就越紧实，同样，材质间的缝隙也就越小。因此，我立刻发现这就是我在寻找的答案。众所周知，潮湿海绵比同等面积的湿木自然干燥的时间更长，因为前者孔隙更大。同理，一块或小块木片要比湿木自然干燥得快。</p></li>
<li><p>“或者，你可以在一块木材上用螺丝锥钻出一些大洞，然后在另一块木材上钻出一些小洞，将它们都浸上水，然后让它们立着直到水蒸发干。两块木头蒸发时间的长短不同，这一点将会更清楚地阐述其中道理。因此，刀片也是一样：淬火锻打差的刀片上，水分盘桓时间更长，由于其材质间的孔隙更大，潮湿微粒吸收更多，所需干燥的时间自然更长。”</p></li>
<li><p>“你的理论至少是极为独到的。”洛克沉吟道，“它让我联想起另一种自然现象，对此，我还没能得出一个能让自己满意的真实解释。问题是这样的：与未经踩踏的土地相比，为什么经过踩踏后的土地上结的冰层更坚硬厚实？我想说，这是因为践踏过的土地更紧密。但是，这一理由足够充分吗？”</p></li>
<li><p>“不，”邦克说，“不过，我可以告诉你其中原因，因为很早以前我已弄清这一问题。你知道，在结冰季节里，即使并非持续进行，我们所获得的大多暖气都是由地面间歇往外发散的。这些温暖的水气向上蒸发，与上方的冷空气混合在一起，中和了温度。</p></li>
<li><p>“现在，这些上升的暖气流被踩踏过的紧实路面几乎完全阻隔，因此，它们会在路面下方自然分散开，从紧实路面旁边的松散土地上发散出来。而那条紧实路面，以及路面以下的一段深度，都保持着冰冷僵硬的状态。冷空气依然会向下渗透过这样的路面，但路面下方却没有暖空气上升、抑制；而暖空气从紧实路面两侧的松散地面上升时，却能抑制、中和从那里下降的冷空气。</p></li>
<li><p>“先生，这就是这个问题的哲学原理所在，你可以充分信赖它。但是，现在我们还是别再继续讨论这些问题了。因为我已经确信，你不仅拥有丰富的知识，还具备独立思考的能力。好了，先生，我希望进一步了解你是否能教会别人如何思考，这是作为教师的另一半基本功。但是，鉴于我不仅想看到这点，也想看到你在其他方面的表现，我想请求你在其中一个男孩身上做个实验。”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“我很乐意，先生。”洛克说。</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>“很好。”邦克一边说着，一边转身走向房间内敞开的壁炉，壁炉里，燃烧着的木材冒出一柱烟雾，“看！你能看到那升起的烟柱吧？我们都知道为什么烟雾会向上升腾，但是，我想我最小的孩子还不知道。现在，请用你自己的方式，看你能否让他弄清来龙去脉。”</p></li>
<li><p>洛克思索了片刻，环顾房间四周，想找点儿东西用来做实验的仪器。他看到架子上有不少东西，其中有一套用来铸铁的方形模件，便从上面取下最小的一件，通常被称为圆形空心管，马车上的轮轴就是用它铸成的。接着，他又拿了一个锡杯，刚好可以将这个方形模件放进去。他将水倒入锡杯中，估摸着如果加上这块铁制模件，便会刚好装满一杯的程度。然后，他将这装着半杯水的锡杯和铁制模件摆在小男孩面前，对他说：</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“好了，孩子，现在请告诉我哪件东西更重。”</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>“当然是那个方形的铁模更重，一定是这样。”男孩说着，一只手拿起那个装了半杯水的锡杯，一只手拿起中空的铁模，掂量了一下。</li>
</ol>
<p>“那么，你觉得与同样体积的水相比，这块铁更重，对吗？”洛克接着问。</p>
<p>“是啊，重多了——这显而易见。”男孩迅速答道。</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>“很好，孩子，现在注意看我在做什么。”洛克一边说着，一边将手里的铁模放到锡杯里去，通过铁模中间的圆洞，杯里的水顿时涨到了杯沿。</li>
</ol>
<p>“瞧，你看见水升到杯沿，是吗？”</p>
<p>“是的，我看到了。”</p>
<p>“好极了，这是什么原因造成的？”</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>“啊，这点我知道得很清楚：因为铁比水更重。当铁沉到水里的时候，下面的水就被挤上来了。”</li>
</ol>
<p>“很正确。现在，我想让你说说，为什么烟会上升到烟囱里。”</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>“等等，——让我想想，”男孩犹豫了一会儿，说，“我，我不知道。”</li>
</ol>
<p>“冬天的时候，你是否曾经在有暖气的房间里，为了看到某些高处的书架而站在椅子上，这样，你的脑袋就靠近天花板了？这个时候，你是否曾注意上升到天花板附近的空气，和靠近地面的空气之间的区别？”</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>“是啊，我记得我曾这么做过，天花板附近的空气温暖得像芥末那么辣，但是当我下来后，把头靠近地板捡起什么东西的时候，地板附近的空气实在太凉。”</li>
</ol>
<p>“确实是这样。不过，我希望你能告诉我，为什么寒冷的空气总是在房间的下方，而温暖的空气却总是能跑到房间上方？”</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li>“为什么，呃，为什么，重的东西会沉下来，所以寒冷的空气——啊，啊，就是这样，我知道了！冷空气比较重，所以它会沉下来，而暖空气会上升。”</li>
</ol>
<p>“太对了！现在，你明白了冷空气比热空气重，就像铁比水重一样。然后，让我们再回到刚才的问题——为什么烟会往上升呢？”</p>
<ol start="19" type="1">
<li><p>“天哪！我现在再清楚不过了：四周的冷空气降下来，就像那件铁模一样，一旦用火加热，驱赶着中间的热空气往上升，就像铁模中间的水一样。热空气带着烟一起上升，就好像旋风会带着羽毛和其他东西上升一样。天哪！我终于知道烟为什么会上升了——这太奇妙了！”</p></li>
<li><p>“真是一位称职的哲学家！”邦克高声叫道，“好了，问题已经完美解决。我要说，你真是一位千里挑一的好老师。你不仅自己能思考，还能教会别人思考；只要你乐意，你随时可以给自己封上这一光荣称号。”</p></li>

<p>George Bancroft (b. 1800, d. 1891) was born at Worcester, Mass. He
was an ambitious student, and graduated at Harvard College before he was
eighteen years of age. He then traveled in Europe, spending some time at
the German universities. On his return, in 1822, he was appointed tutor
in Greek at Harvard. His writings at this time were a small volume of
original poems, some translations from Schiller and Goethe, and a few
striking essays. Mr. Bancroft has held numerous high political offices.
In 1838 he was appointed collector of the port at Boston; in 1845 he was
made secretary of the Navy; in 1849 he was sent as United States
Minister to Great Britain; and in 1867 he was sent in the same capacity
to Prussia. The work which has given Mr. Bancroft his great literary
reputation is his “History of the United States, from the Discovery of
the American Continent.” The first volume appeared in 1834.
Philosophical in reasoning, interesting, terse in style, and founded on
careful research, under the most favorable advantages, the work stands
alone in its sphere.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The evening of the fifth came on. The young moon was shining
brightly in a cloudless winter sky, and its light was increased by a
new-fallen snow. Parties of soldiers were driving about the streets,
making a parade of valor, challenging resistance, and striking the
inhabitants indiscriminately [1] with sticks or sheathed
cutlasses.</p></li>
<li><p>A band, which poured out from Murray’s barracks, in Brattle
Street, armed with clubs, cutlasses, and bayonets, provoked resistance,
and a fray ensued [2] . Ensign [3] Maul, at the gate of the barrack
yard, cried to the soldiers: “Turn out, and I will stand by you; kill
them; stick them; knock them down; run your bayonets through them.” One
soldier after another leveled a firelock [4] , and threatened to “make a
lane” through the crowd.</p></li>
<li><p>Just before nine, as an officer crossed King Street, now State
Street, a barber’s lad cried after him: “There goes a mean fellow who
hath not paid my father for dressing his hair;” on which, the sentinel
stationed at the westerly end of the customhouse, on the corner of King
Street and Exchange Lane, left his post, and with his musket gave the
boy a stroke on the head, that made him stagger and cry for
pain.</p></li>
<li><p>The street soon became clear, and nobody troubled the sentry,
when a party of soldiers issued violently from the main guard, their
arms glittering in the moonlight, and passed on, hallooing: “Where are
they? where are they? Let them come.”</p></li>
<li><p>Presently twelve or fifteen more, uttering the same cries, rushed
from the south into King Street, and so by the way of Cornhill towards
Murray’s barracks. “Pray, soldiers, spare my life,” cried a boy of
twelve, whom they met. “No, no, I’ll kill you all,” answered one of
them, and knocked him down with his cutlass. They abused and insulted
several persons at their doors and others in the street; “running about
like madmen in a fury,” crying, “Fire!” which seemed their watchword,
and, “Where are they? Knock them down.” Their outrageous behavior
occasioned the ringing of the bell at the head of King Street.</p></li>
<li><p>The citizens, whom the alarm set in motion, came out with canes
and clubs; and, partly by the interference of well-disposed officers,
partly by the courage of Crispus Attucks, a mulatto, and some others,
the fray at the barracks was soon over. Of the citizens, the prudent
shouted, “Home! home!” others, it is said, cried out, “Huzza for the
main guard! there is the nest;” but the main guard was not molested the
whole evening.</p></li>
<li><p>A body of soldiers came up Royal Exchange Lane, crying, “Where
are the cowards?” and, brandishing [5] their arms, passed through King
Street. From ten to twenty boys came after them, asking, “Where are
they? where are they?” “There is the soldier who knocked me down,” said
the barber’s boy; and they began pushing one another towards the
sentinel. He loaded and primed his musket. “The lobster is going to
fire,” cried a boy. Waving his piece about, the sentinel pulled the
trigger.</p></li>
<li><p>“If you fire you must die for it,” said Henry Knox, who was
passing by. “I don’t care,” replied the sentry, “if they touch me, I’ll
fire.” “Fire!” shouted the boys, for they were persuaded he could not do
it without leave from a civil officer; and a young fellow spoke out, “We
will knock him down for snapping,” while they whistled through their
fingers and huzzaed. “Stand off !” said the sentry, and shouted aloud,
“Turn out, main guard!” “They are killing the sentinel,” reported a
servant from the customhouse, running to the main guard. “Turn out! why
don’t you turn cut?” cried Preston, who was captain of the day, to the
guard.</p></li>
<li><p>A party of six, two of whom, Kilroi and Montgomery, had been
worsted at the ropewalk, formed, with a corporal in front and Preston
following. With bayonets fixed, they “rushed through the people” upon
the trot, cursing them, and pushing them as they went along. They found
about ten persons round the sentry, while about fifty or sixty came down
with them. “For God’s sake,” said Knox! holding Preston by the coat,
“take your men back again; if they fire, your life must answer for the
consequences.” “I know what I am about,” said he hastily, and much
agitated.</p></li>
<li><p>None pressed on them or provoked them till they began loading,
when a party of about twelve in number, with sticks in their hands,
moved from the middle of the street where they had been standing, gave
three cheers, and passed along the front of the soldiers, whose muskets
some of them struck as they went by. “You are cowardly rascals,” they
said, “for bringing arms against naked men.” “Lay aside your guns, and
we are ready for you.” “Are the soldiers loaded?” inquired Palmes of
Preston. “Yes,” he answered, “with powder and ball.” “Are they going to
fire upon the inhabitants?” asked Theodore Bliss. “They can not, without
my orders,” replied Preston; while “the town-born” called out, “Come on,
you rascals, you bloody backs, you lobster scoundrels, fire, if you
dare. We know you dare not.”</p></li>
<li><p>Just then, Montgomery received a blow from a stick which had hit
his musket; and the word “fire!” being given by Preston, he stepped a
little to one side, and shot Attucks, who at the time was quietly
leaning on a long stick. “Don’t fire!” said Langford, the watchman, to
Kilroi, looking him full in the face; but yet he did so, and Samuel
Gray, who was standing next Langford, fell lifeless. The rest fired
slowly and in succession on the people, who were dispersing. Three
persons were killed, among them Attucks, the mulatto; eight were
wounded, two of them mortally. Of all the eleven, not more than one had
any share in the disturbance.</p></li>
<li><p>So infuriated were the soldiers that, when the men returned to
take up the dead, they prepared to fire again, but were checked by
Preston, while the Twenty-ninth Regiment appeared under arms in King
Street. “This is our time,” cried the soldiers of the Fourteenth; and
dogs were never seen more greedy for their prey.</p></li>
<li><p>The bells rung in all the churches; the town drums beat. “To
arms! to arms!” was the cry. “Our hearts,” said Warren, “beat to arms,
almost resolved by one stroke to avenge the death of our slaughtered
brethren;” but they stood self-possessed [6] , demanding justice
according to the law. “Did you not know that you should not have fired
without the order of a civil magistrate?” asked Hutchinson, on meeting
Preston. “I did it,” answered Preston, “to save my men.”</p></li>
<li><p>The people would not be pacified [7] or retire till the regiment
was confined to the guardroom and the barracks; and Hutchinson himself
gave assurances that instant inquiries should be made by the county
magistrates. One hundred persons remained to keep watch on the
examination, which lasted till three hours after midnight. A warrant [8]
was issued against Preston, who surrendered himself to the sheriff; and
the soldiers of his party were delivered up and committed to
prison.</p></li>

<p>乔治·班克罗夫特（1800—1891）出生于美国马萨诸塞州伍斯特市。班克罗夫特学生时代便具有远大志向，不满十八岁便从哈佛大学毕业。毕业后，他游历欧洲，在德国的几所大学里待了一段时间。
1822年，他返回美国，开始在哈佛大学执教希腊语。在那段时间里，他出版的作品包括一册薄薄的原创诗歌集，一些席勒和歌德作品的译作，以及一些引起很大反响的散文。班克罗夫特身兼数项政治要职：1838年，他被任命为波士顿港口税收官；1845年，他被任命美国海军部长；1849年，他担任美国驻英国大使，并于1867年被派驻在普鲁士。在班克罗夫特的作品中，《美国历史：从美洲大陆的发现》一书为他赢得极大文学声誉。这部书首次出版于1834年，该书纵横捭阖，研究资料翔实可信，富有哲学推理，饶有趣味，风格洗练，历史视角极为优越，在世界同类作品中堪当独树一帜。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>第五个夜晚来临了。冬夜，初升的月亮从寂寥无云的天空中撒落明亮的清辉，新雪将月光映得更为清冷亮丽了。成群的英军士兵开着车在街道上行驶着，耀武扬威，用棍棒或带着护套的弯刀镇压着抵抗者，同时不分青红皂白地殴打镇上的居民。</p></li>
<li><p>一队士兵从布雷托大街的穆雷兵营里跑出，他们全副武装地配备棍棒、弯刀还有刺刀，挑衅着抵抗者，一场殴斗随之而来。少尉摩尔站在兵营门前，向士兵们高喊道：“冲出去！我会支持你们；杀了他们，将他们打翻在地，用刺刀刺穿他们的胸膛！”一个个士兵拉起手中的枪栓，威胁着要在人群中“杀出一条血路”。</p></li>
<li><p>不到晚上九点的时候，一名军官穿过国王大街，即现在的州立大街。一名理发店少年在他身后叫喊着：“这个卑鄙的家伙走过来了，他理发后没给我爸付钱！”听到这个叫喊声，守卫在国王大街与交易小巷的交叉处、海关西边哨兵点的警卫离开了他的岗位，用他的步枪在男孩头上狠狠来了一下子，男孩趔趄几步，痛苦地叫唤起来。</p></li>
<li><p>街道上很快变得空荡无人，没有人敢上前向这个警卫找麻烦。一队士兵从驻防军总部猛烈地冲过来，手中的武器在月光下发出凛冽寒光，他们一边跑，一边不停高喊：“这群暴徒在哪里？究竟在哪里？让他们来吧！”</p></li>
<li><p>很快，还有十二或十五六队士兵，高喊着同样的话，从南面，或从康希尔小路朝着穆雷兵营的方向，冲进国王大街。“求求你们，长官，饶了我吧。”当他们冲到这里的时候，那个十二岁的男孩哭着哀求道。“做梦！我们一定要把你们杀个片甲不留！”其中一个士兵吼道，用刺刀将那孩子刺翻在地。同时，他们肆意辱骂其他一些站在家门口的居民或路上的行人，一边“像一群发怒的疯子们在街头乱跑”，一边怒吼着：“开火！”这似乎是他们的口号，士兵们狂妄地叫嚣，“他们在哪里？将他们统统打倒！”他们的无耻行为激怒了市民，国王大街街头的钟声遽然响起。</p></li>
<li><p>钟声惊动了市民，他们纷纷拿着手杖和棍棒冲出来。由于素日处事稳妥的政府官员介入，在克里斯普斯·阿塔克斯，一位黑白混血市民，以及其他市民的勇敢交涉下，兵营里的殴斗很快结束了。在市民当中，有些谨慎的人喊道：“回家吧！大家回家吧！”但是，据说另一些人高喊道：“冲到驻防军总部去！那儿才是他们的老窝！”话虽这么说，整整一晚，驻防军总部都相安无事。</p></li>
<li><p>一群士兵从皇家交易小巷冲过来，高声叫道：“那群胆小鬼在哪儿？”他们挥舞中手中的武器，巡查着国王大街。十来个少年跟在他们身后，模仿奚弄道：“他们在哪儿？他们在哪儿？”“就是那个士兵把我打倒在地的！”理发店的少年叫起来。这些少年们推搡着向哨兵挤去。哨兵急忙装填子弹，举枪瞄准。“英国龙虾兵要开枪了！”一个男孩尖叫道。哨兵挥舞着他的步枪，松开扳柄，随时可能扣动扳机。</p></li>
<li><p>“如果你敢开枪，你就必死无疑。”刚巧路过这里的书商亨利·诺克斯说道。“我不在乎，”哨兵回答道，“他们要是敢碰我，我就开枪！”“你开枪啊！”男孩们挑衅地高喊道。他们曾听说，要是没有市政官员的许可，他是不被允许开枪的。男孩们用手指吹着口哨，场面一片喧闹。这时，一个少年高叫道：“把他打倒！折断他的枪！”“退后！退后！”哨兵大声高喊着，“请求支援！请求支援，驻防军总部！”“那群混蛋打算杀了我们的哨兵！”有个士兵从海关处冲到驻防军总部禀报。“出动！火速赶到那里！”当天执勤的上尉普雷斯顿冲着士兵们吼道。</p></li>
<li><p>一行六名士兵迅速赶往现场。士兵基瑞和蒙哥马利二人也在其中，他们曾在制绳厂事件中被当地工人打伤。一名下士冲在前面，上尉普雷斯顿紧随其后。他们手里端着刺刀“冲进人群”，边跑边咒骂推搡着聚集的人群。他们看见大概有十来人正围着哨兵，还有五六十人在他们身后聚拢过来。“看在上帝的份儿上！”书商诺克斯怒斥着！他抓住上尉普雷斯顿的衣领，愤怒地说：“把你的人带回去！要是他们开火了，你要用性命承担后果！”“我知道我该怎么做！”普雷斯顿厉声说道，神色极为恼怒。</p></li>
<li><p>没有市民推搡或激怒这些士兵，直到他们开始装填子弹，人群中才爆发出叫骂骚动，推挤着、挑衅着士兵们。这时，大约十二名手上拿着棍子的市民，从刚才站立的国王大街中央冲将过来，他们高叫数声，从荷枪实弹的士兵面前跑过，有些人的身体甚至抵着士兵手里的步枪。“你们这群懦夫！流氓！”他们叫骂道，“你们竟然将武器对准手无寸铁的市民！”“把枪放下，我们好好来拼一场！”“这些枪都上好子弹了？”地方官帕尔姆斯问上尉普雷斯顿。“是的，”普雷斯顿答道，“已经填好了铁砂和火药。”“你们真打算向市民们开枪？”地方官西奥多·布利斯不敢置信地问道。“没有我的命令，他们不会开枪。”普雷斯顿回答。波士顿土生土长的市民们高叫道：“来吧，你们这群畜生，你们这群嗜血的恶棍，英国龙虾军的流氓！你们开枪啊，要是你们敢动手的话！你们根本就不敢开枪。”</p></li>
<li><p>就在那时，有人用棍子击打着士兵蒙哥马利手中的步枪，但是却狠狠打到他身上。上尉普雷斯顿下令：“开枪！”蒙哥马利向旁边退开一步，开枪击中阿塔克斯，后者当时正一声不吭地倚靠在一根长棍上。“不要开枪！”巡夜人兰福德迎面冲着士兵基瑞叫道，但后者还是扣动了扳机，站在兰福德身边的塞缪尔·格雷应声倒地，死了。随后，连续缓慢的枪声在人群中炸开，市民们纷纷四下逃散。最终有三人被打死，其中包括那名黑白混血儿阿塔克斯；八人受伤，其中两人不治而亡。在所有十一个死伤者当中，仅有一名曾参与现场暴乱。</p></li>
<li><p>士兵们的情绪仍然愤怒高亢，当市民们返身想搬走尸体的时候，他们几乎准备再次开枪，但是被上尉普雷斯顿制止了。这时，第二十九军团士兵全副武装地赶到国王大街。“这是我们的胜利时刻！”第十四军团的士兵高喊道，就连猎犬们争夺猎物的时候，都没有他们这么贪婪。</p></li>
<li><p>所有教堂的钟声訇然响成一片，波士顿全镇鼓声齐鸣，
“武装起来！武装起来！”市民们群情激昂。地方官沃伦说：“几乎是第一声战鼓响起，我们就下定决心，为我们被屠杀的兄弟们复仇。”但是，市民们站在那里，克制着他们激愤的情绪，强烈要求诉诸法律，将这些刽子手们绳之于法。“难道你们不知道，没有地方行政长官的命令，你们不能开火？”当时的马萨诸塞州副州长哈钦森赶到现场，质问着普雷斯顿上尉。“我下令开火，”后者回答道，“是为了保护我手下的士兵。”</p></li>
<li><p>市民们仍然愤怒难抑，不肯退去，直到英军士兵被限制在驻防地或军营里，不准外出。哈钦森本人做出承诺，波士顿地方官员将即刻对这起案件着手进行调查。仍然有一百多名市民留下来，监督着这场盘查。盘查直到凌晨三点才结束。普雷斯顿本人已向当地司法官认罪，法官签发了一份针对他的逮捕书，他下属的涉案士兵也被移交并投入监狱。</p></li>

<p>SQUEERS’S METHOD</p>
<p>斯格威尔的教学方法</p>
<p>Charles Dickens (b. 1812, d. 1870). This celebrated novelist was born
in Portsmouth, England. He began his active life as a lawyer’s
apprentice, in London; but soon became a reporter, and followed this
occupation from 1831 to 1836. His first book was entitled “Sketches of
London Society, by Boz.” In 1837 he published the “Pickwick Papers,” a
work which established his reputation as a writer. His other works
followed with great rapidity, and his last, “Edwin Drood,” was
unfinished when he died. He visited America in 1842 and in 1867. He is
buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Dickens excelled in humor and pathos,
and was particularly successful in delineating the joys and griefs of
childhood. His writings have a tendency to prompt to deeds of kindness
and benevolence. The following extract is taken from “Nicholas
Nickleby,” one of the best of his novels.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Come,” said Squeers, “let’s go to the schoolroom; and lend me a
hand with my school coat, will you?”</li>
</ol>
<p>Nicholas assisted his master to put on an old fustian [1] shooting
jacket, which he took down from a peg in the passage; and Squeers,
arming himself with his cane, led the way across a yard to a door in the
rear of the house.</p>
<p>“There,” said the schoolmaster, as they stepped in together; “this is
our shop, Nickleby.”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>It was such a crowded scene, and there were so many objects to
attract attention, that at first Nicholas stared about him, really
without seeing anything at all. By degrees, however, the place resolved
[2] itself into a bare and dirty room with a couple of windows, whereof
a tenth part might be of glass, the remainder being stopped up with old
copy books and paper.</p></li>
<li><p>There were a couple of long, old, rickety desks, cut and notched,
and inked and damaged in every possible way; two or three forms, a
detached desk for Squeers, and another for his assistant. The ceiling
was supported like that of a barn, by crossbeams and rafters, and the
walls were so stained and discolored that it was impossible to tell
whether they had ever been touched by paint or whitewash.</p></li>
<li><p>Pale and haggard faces, lank and bony figures, children with the
countenances of old men, deformities [3] with irons upon their limbs,
boys of stunted [4] growth, and others whose long, meager [5] legs would
hardly bear their stooping bodies, all crowded on the view together.
There were little faces which should have been handsome, darkened with
the scowl of sullen, dogged suffering; there was childhood with the
light of its eye quenched, its beauty gone, and its helplessness alone
remaining.</p></li>
<li><p>And yet this scene, painful as it was, had its grotesque [6]
features, which, in a less interested observer than Nicholas, might have
provoked a smile. Mrs. Squeers stood at one of the desks, presiding over
an immense basin of brimstone and treacle, of which delicious compound
she administered [7] a large installment [8] to each boy in succession,
using for the purpose a common wooden spoon, which might have been
originally manufactured for some gigantic top, and which widened every
young gentleman’s mouth considerably, they being all obliged, under
heavy corporeal [9] penalties, to take in the whole bowl at a
gasp.</p></li>
<li><p>“Now,” said Squeers, giving the desk a great rap with his cane,
which made half the little boys nearly jump out of their boots, “is that
physicking [10] over?”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Just over,” said Mrs. Squeers, choking the last boy in her hurry,
and tapping the crown of his head with the wooden spoon to restore him.
“Here, you Smike: take away now. Look sharp!”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Smike shuffled out with the basin, and Mrs. Squeers hurried out
after him into a species of washhouse, where there was a small fire, and
a large kettle, together with a number of little wooden bowls which were
arranged upon a board. Into these bowls Mrs. Squeers, assisted by the
hungry servant, poured a brown composition which looked like diluted
[11] pincushions without the covers, and was called porridge. A minute
wedge of brown bread was inserted in each bowl, and when they had eaten
their porridge by means of the bread, the boys ate the bread itself, and
had finished their breakfast, whereupon Mr. Squeers went away to his
own.</p></li>
<li><p>After some half-hour’s delay Mr. Squeers reappeared, and the boys
took their places and their books, of which latter commodity [12] the
average might be about one to eight learners. A few minutes having
elapsed, during which Mr. Squeers looked very profound [13] , as if he
had a perfect apprehension [14] of what was inside all the books, and
could say every word of their contents by heart, if he only chose to
take the trouble, that gentleman called up the first class.</p></li>
<li><p>Obedient to this summons there ranged themselves in front of the
schoolmaster’s desk, half a dozen scarecrows, out at knees and elbows,
one of whom placed a torn and filthy book beneath his learned
eye.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“This is the first class in English spelling and philosophy,
Nickleby,” said Squeers, beckoning Nicholas to stand beside him. “We’ll
get up a Latin one, and hand that over to you. Now, then, where’s the
first boy?”</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>“Please, sir, he’s cleaning the back parlor window,” said the
temporary [15] head of the philosophical class.</li>
</ol>
<p>“So he is, to be sure,” rejoined Squeers. “We go upon the practical
mode of teaching, Nickleby; the regular education system. C-l-e-a-n,
clean, verb active, to make bright, to scour. W-i-n, win, d-e-r, der,
winder, a casement. When the boy knows this out of book, he goes and
does it. It’s just the same principle as the use of the globes. Where’s
the second boy?”</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>“Please, sir, he is weeding the garden,” replied a small voice.</li>
</ol>
<p>“To be sure,” said Squeers, by no means disconcerted [16] , “so he
is. B-o-t, bot, t-i-n, tin, n-e-y, ney, bottinney, noun substantive, a
knowledge of plants. When he has learned that bottinney means a
knowledge of plants, he goes and knows ’em. That’s our system, Nickleby:
what do you think of it?”</p>
<p>“It’s a very useful one, at any rate,” answered Nicholas,
significantly [17] .</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>“I believe you,” rejoined Squeers, not remarking the emphasis of his
usher. “Third boy, what’s a horse?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“A beast, sir,” replied the boy.</p>
<p>“So it is,” said Squeers. “Ain’t it, Nickleby?”</p>
<p>“I believe there is no doubt of that, sir,” answered Nicholas.</p>
<p>“Of course there is n’t,” said Squeers. “A horse is a quadruped, and
quadruped’s Latin for beast, as everybody that’s gone through the
grammar knows, or else where’s the use of having grammars at all?”</p>
<p>“Where, indeed!” said Nicholas, abstractedly [18] .</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>“As you’re perfect in that,” resumed Squeers, turning to the boy,
“go and look after my horse, and rub him down well, or I’ll rub you
down. The rest of the class go and draw water up till somebody tells you
to leave off, for it’s washing day to-morrow, and they want the coppers
filled.”</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTES.—The novel from which this story is abridged, aided greatly in
a much-needed reform in the Yorkshire schools; and the character of
Squeers was so true to life, that numerous suits were threatened against
Mr. Dickens by those who thought themselves caricatured.</p>

<p>查尔斯·狄更斯（1812—1870），著名小说家，出生于英国朴次茅斯。狄更斯早年进入伦敦律师界做学徒，但很快就转行成为记者，并于1831年至1836年持续了五年时间。他的首部作品题为《博兹札记：伦敦上流社会的剪影》。
1837年，狄更斯出版了《匹克威克外传》，奠定了他的文坛地位。随后，他的其他作品便相继问世，《艾德温·德鲁德之谜》为作家去世前未及封笔之作。狄更斯分别于1842年和1867年两次访问美国。去世后，他被埋葬在威斯敏斯特大教堂。狄更斯先生擅长幽默和感伤，尤其擅长刻画童年的欢乐和悲伤。他的作品倾向于宣扬宽厚与仁慈的品行。下文节选自狄更斯最好的小说之一《尼古拉斯·尼克贝》。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“来吧，”斯格威尔说，“我们去教室吧。拿着，帮我拿一下我的校服。”</li>
</ol>
<p>尼古拉斯从走廊的衣钩上取下校长那件老旧的棉麻狩猎装，帮校长穿上。斯格威尔校长拿起手杖，在前面领着路，穿过一个院子，走到一栋房屋的后门前面。</p>
<p>“到地方了。”校长一边说着，一边带着他走进房间，“这就是我们的教室，尼克贝。”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>眼前的景象相当凌乱，有这么多吸引视线的东西。一时间，尼古拉斯只是茫然地环顾着四周，丝毫不清楚自己在看些什么。然而，渐渐地，他才看清这个地方原来是一个空荡荡的肮脏房间，有几扇窗户，大概只有十分之一的窗户上装着玻璃，其余的窗户只是用旧书和报纸简单地糊起来。</p></li>
<li><p>房间里，有几张窄长破旧的书桌，摇摇晃晃的，桌上布满凹槽刻痕，到处都墨迹斑斑，损坏得不成样子。斯格威尔有一张单独的桌子，另一张是他助手的。教室的天花板靠横梁和椽子支撑搭起，看起来像是谷仓。墙壁上满是污迹脏渍，根本看不出来它是否漆过或刷白过。</p></li>
<li><p>孩子们面色苍白憔悴，身材羸弱瘦削，脸上带着老人般的苍老神情，瘦骨嶙峋甚而畸形变态。孩子们挤在一起，有些男孩发育不良，身形瘦小；有些男孩纤细长腿好似竹竿，几乎无法支撑起他们佝偻的身体。这些本该是健康活泼的小脸上，面色晦暗，满脸愁容，写满了苦难和挣扎。孩子们的眼眸里，那属于孩童的光亮早已熄灭，没有天真开朗，只剩下漠然的无助和悲哀。</p></li>
<li><p>眼前景象痛苦扭曲，却不乏荒诞无稽的悲戚。要是换了一个不像尼古拉斯这么在意的观察者，没准还能笑出声来。课桌上摆着一个硕大的面盆，里面是硫磺粉和糖浆的美味调和物。斯格威尔夫人站在课桌旁边，负责将这调和物喂到每个孩子嘴里。男孩们排队走过来，每个人嘴里都被灌了一大勺。斯格威尔夫人拿的是一柄家常硕大木勺，最初也许是被设计给巨人用的。那柄硕大勺子迫使男孩们竭力张大嘴巴，一口气吞下一大碗的分量，这简直是场肉体上的酷刑。</p></li>
<li><p>“现在，”斯格威尔用手杖重重敲了一下书桌，几乎让一半以上的男孩都惊吓得跳起来，“治疗结束了吗？”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“刚刚结束。”斯格威尔太太答道，她手忙脚乱地往最后一个男孩嘴里灌下药，他噎住了，于是她拿着手里的木勺猛地敲打孩子的脑袋，他才缓过气来，“好了，斯迈克，把这个盆子拿走。长点眼！”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>斯迈克端着盆，拖着脚走了，斯格威尔夫人催促地跟在他身后。他们走进一个看起来像是洗漱间的地方，炉灶上的火苗很小，旁边的木板上放着一个很大的茶壶和数个小木碗。在这个饥肠辘辘的学生帮助下，斯格威尔夫人将一盆褐色混合物倒进每个小木碗里。碗里的食物稀薄得像针垫上的针眼，被叫作“粥”。接着，斯格威尔夫人在每个碗里都放上一小撮面包。当男孩们喝完碗里的粥，粥里的那一丁点儿面包也就下肚了。就这样，他们吃完了早餐，而斯格威尔先生离开，独自享用他的早餐了。</p></li>
<li><p>过了半个多小时，斯格威尔先生回来了。孩子们在各自的位置上，拿出书本。书本很破旧，看起来每本书平均曾有一至八名学生使用过。几分钟过去了，斯格威尔先生什么都不说，只摆出一副知识渊博的模样，就好像他对书里的所有内容都领悟透彻，对每个词语的解释都了然于胸。过了一会儿，这名先生终于选择为自己增添麻烦，宣布开始上第一堂课。</p></li>
<li><p>孩子们服从校长的指示，乖顺地在他书桌前列成一排。这六七个孩子瘦得像稻草人一样，膝盖和手肘间都是破洞，其中一个孩子拿着一本污秽而破烂不堪的书，放在校长博学睿智的眼皮底下。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“我们的第一堂课，是英文拼写和拉丁语法课，尼克贝，”斯格威尔先生说着，示意尼古拉斯走过去站在他身旁。他说：“我们会学习一个拉丁语单词，然后手把手地教会你们。现在，一号男孩在哪儿？”</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>“报告，先生，他正在清洗客厅的后窗。”语法课的临时班长报告说。</li>
</ol>
<p>“哦，当然，很好。”斯格威尔继续说道，“我们所使用的教学模式是实践性的，尼克贝，是最常规的教学体系。
C-l-e-a-n， clean，动词主动态，意思是洗刷东西，让它变得明亮。 W-i-n，
win， d-e-r， der，
winder，卷起，卷起窗扉。要是一个男孩从书上学会这一点，他就会走过去照做，这就是世界上通用的法则。二号男孩在哪里？”</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>“报告，先生，他在花园除草。”一个微弱的声音回答道。</li>
</ol>
<p>“很好。”斯格威尔说道，声音坦然，没有丝毫窘迫不安，“很好，他在除草。
B-o-t， bot， t-i-n， tin， n-e-y， ney，
bottinney，名词性质，植物学知识。当一个男孩了解到，
bottinney指的是植物学知识，他就会去试图了解它们。这就是我们的教学方法，尼克贝，你觉得呢？”</p>
<p>“无论如何，这都是非常有用的教学方法。”尼古拉斯意味深长地回答道。</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>“我同意你的意见。”斯格威尔接着说，丝毫没有察觉出尼古拉斯的弦外之音，“三号男孩，马是什么？”</li>
</ol>
<p>“一种动物，先生，”男孩回答。</p>
<p>“正是。”斯格威尔说，“难道不是吗，尼克贝？”</p>
<p>“这是毫无疑问的，先生。”尼古拉斯回答道。</p>
<p>“当然，这是毫无疑问的。”斯格威尔说，“马是一种四足动物，而四足动物这个单词，quadruped，在拉丁语里就是动物的意思。这一点，每个学过语法的学生都知道，否则，学习语法究竟还有什么用呢？”</p>
<p>“是啊，究竟有什么用呢！”尼古拉斯心不在焉地附和着。</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>“你对这个问题回答得很完美。”斯格威尔转向那个男孩，对他说道，“现在，去好好照看我的马匹，将它全身刷洗干净。否则，小心我修理你。其余的学生去提水，没有吩咐不得停下休息。明天是清洗日，所有大缸小盆都要统统装满。”</li>

<p>Mrs. S. M. B. Piatt (b. 1835, ——) was born near Lexington, Ky. While
still a young girl she began to write poetry, which was well received.

<p>CAPTURING THE WILD HORSE</p>
<p>捕捉野马</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We left the buffalo camp about eight o’clock, and had a toilsome
and harassing march of two hours, over ridges of hills covered with a
ragged forest of scrub oaks, and broken by deep gullies [1] .</p></li>
<li><p>About ten o’clock in the morning we came to where this line of
rugged hills swept down into a valley, through which flowed the north
fork of Red River. A beautiful meadow, about half a mile wide, enameled
with yellow, autumnal flowers, stretched for two or three miles along
the foot of the hills, bordered on the opposite side by the river, whose
banks were fringed with cottonwood trees, the bright foliage of which
refreshed and delighted the eye, after being wearied by the
contemplation of monotonous wastes of brown forest.</p></li>
<li><p>The meadow was finely diversified [2] by groves and clumps of
trees, so happily dispersed that they seemed as if set out by the hand
of art. As we cast our eyes over this fresh and delightful valley, we
beheld a troop of wild horses quietly grazing on a green lawn, about a
mile distant, to our right, while to our left, at nearly the same
distance, were several buffaloes; some feeding, others reposing, and
ruminating [3] among the high, rich herbage [4] , under the shade of a
clump of cottonwood trees. The whole had the appearance of a broad,
beautiful tract of pasture land, on the highly ornamented estate of some
gentleman farmer, with his cattle grazing about the lawns and
meadows.</p></li>
<li><p>A council of war was now held, and it was determined to profit by
the present favorable opportunity, and try our hand at the grand hunting
maneuver which is called “ringing the wild horse.” This requires a large
party of horsemen, well mounted. They extend themselves in each
direction, at a certain distance apart, and gradually form a ring of two
or three miles in circumference, so as to surround the game. This must
be done with extreme care, for the wild horse is the most readily
alarmed inhabitant of the prairie [5] , and can scent a hunter a great
distance, if to windward [6] .</p></li>
<li><p>The ring being formed, two or three ride toward the horses, which
start off in an opposite direction. Whenever they approach the bounds of
the ring, however, a huntsman presents himself, and turns them from
their course. In this way they are checked, and driven back at every
point, and kept galloping round and round this magic circle, until,
being completely tired down, it is easy for hunters to ride up beside
them and throw the lariat [7] over their heads. The prime horses of the
most speed, courage, and bottom [8] , however, are apt to break through
and escape, so that, in general, it is the second-rate horses that are
taken.</p></li>
<li><p>Preparations were now made for a hunt of this kind. The pack
horses were now taken into the woods and firmly tied to trees, lest in a
rush of the wild horses they should break away. Twenty-five men were
then sent under the command of a lieutenant to steal along the edge of
the valley within the strip of wood that skirted the hills. They were to
station themselves about fifty yards apart, within the edge of the
woods, and not advance or show themselves until the horses dashed in
that direction. Twenty-five men were sent across the valley to steal in
like manner along the river bank that bordered the opposite side, and to
station themselves among the trees.</p></li>
<li><p>A third party of about the same number was to form a line,
stretching across the lower part of the valley, so as to connect the two
wings. Beatte and our other half-breed, Antoine, together with the
ever-officious Tonish, were to make a circuit through the woods so as to
get to the upper part of the valley, in the rear of the horses, and
drive them forward into the kind of sack that we had formed, while the
two wings should join behind them and make a complete circle.</p></li>
<li><p>The flanking [9] parties were quietly extending themselves out of
sight, on each side of the valley, and the residue were stretching
themselves like the links of a chain across it, when the wild horses
gave signs that they scented an enemy; snuffing the air, snorting, and
looking about. At length they pranced off slowly toward the river, and
disappeared behind a green bank.</p></li>
<li><p>Here, had the regulations of the chase been observed, they would
have been quietly checked and turned back by the advance of a hunter
from among the trees. Unluckily, however, we had our wildfire,
Jack-o’-lantern [10] little Frenchman to deal with. Instead of keeping
quietly up the right side of the valley, to get above the horses, the
moment he saw them move toward the river he broke out of the covert [11]
of woods and dashed furiously across the plain in pursuit of them. This
put an end to all system. The half-breeds, and half a score of rangers,
joined in the chase.</p></li>
<li><p>A way they all went over the green bank. In a moment or two the
wild horses reappeared, and came thundering down the valley, with
Frenchman, half-breeds, and rangers galloping and bellowing behind them.
It was in vain that the line drawn across the valley attempted to check
and turn back the fugitives; they were too hotly pressed by their
pursuers: in their panic [12] they dashed through the line, and
clattered down the plain.</p></li>
<li><p>The whole troop joined in the headlong chase, some of the rangers
without hats or caps, their hair flying about their ears, and others
with handkerchiefs tied round their heads. The buffaloes, which had been
calmly ruminating among the herbage, heaved up their huge forms, gazed
for a moment at the tempest that came scouring down the meadow, then
turned and took to heavy, rolling flight. They were soon overtaken; the
promiscuous [13] throng were pressed together by the contracting sides
of the valley, and away they went, pellmell, hurry-skurry, wild buffalo,
wild horse, wild huntsman, with clang and clatter, and whoop and halloo,
that made the forests ring.</p></li>
<li><p>At length the buffaloes turned into a green brake, on the river
bank, while the horses dashed up a narrow defile of the hills, with
their pursuers close to their heels. Beatte passed several of them,
having fixed his eye upon a fine Pawnee horse that had his ears slit and
saddle marks upon his back. He pressed him gallantly, but lost him in
the woods.</p></li>
<li><p>Among the wild horses was a fine black mare, which in scrambling
up the defile tripped and fell. A young ranger sprang from his horse and
seized her by the mane and muzzle. Another ranger dismounted and came to
his assistance. The mare struggled fiercely, kicking and biting, and
striking with her fore feet, but a noose was slipped over her head, and
her struggles were in vain.</p></li>
<li><p>It was some time, however, before she gave over rearing and
plunging, and lashing out with her feet on every side. The two rangers
then led her along the valley, by two strong lariats, which enabled them
to keep at a sufficient distance on each side to be out of the reach of
her hoofs, and whenever she struck out in one direction she was jerked
in the other. In this way her spirit was gradually subdued.</p></li>
<li><p>As to Tonish, who had marred [14] the whole scene by his
precipitancy, he had been more successful than he deserved, having
managed to catch a beautiful cream-colored colt about seven months old,
that had not strength to keep up with its companions. The mercurial [15]
little Frenchman was beside himself with exultation. It was amusing to
see him with his prize. The colt would rear and kick, and struggle to
get free, when Tonish would take him about the neck, wrestle with him,
jump on his back, and cut as many antics as a monkey with a
kitten.</p></li>
<li><p>Nothing surprised me more, however, than to witness how soon
these poor animals, thus taken from the unbounded freedom of the
prairie, yielded to the dominion of man. In the course of two or three
days the mare and colt went with the led horses and became quite
docile.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>我们八点钟左右离开了野牛营地，费力艰辛地跋涉了两个小时，翻山越岭。山岭间覆盖着参差不齐的矮橡树林，途中不时可见幽深的溪谷沟壑。</p></li>
<li><p>上午十点钟左右，我们来到了这些崎岖山岭的脚下。山脚下有条溪谷，那是红河的北端支流。在我们面前，是一个约半英里宽的美丽草甸，点缀着秋天金黄灿烂的花朵，沿着山脚绵延两三英里，抵达河流对岸一侧。河岸边，长着三角叶白杨。在看倦了满眼单调褐色的森林后，突然见到这杨树上明亮的黄叶，顿时令人眼前一亮。</p></li>
<li><p>草甸上恰好层次分明，一边是低矮的灌木，一边是高大的树木。它们分散着点缀在草地上，看起来是那么和谐，像是被一双艺术的大手精巧排列过一样。当我们将目光投向那条清新怡人的溪谷，只看见在我们右边大约一英里的地方，有一队野马群正在油绿的草坪上安静地吃草。在我们左侧几乎差不多远的地方，在一片三角叶白杨的浓荫下，几只野牛正在草甸盘桓，有的在啃吃青草，有的正在高高的、长势茂盛的牧草间歇息反刍。这样的景色，看起来像是某位绅士所拥有的一片宽阔美丽的牧场，打理得很细致，而他放牧的牲畜正在牧场的草地上从容悠闲地吃草。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，就如何捕捉这群野马，我们召开了战前会议，抓住目前有利机遇乃是上策，我们决定用一个被称为“围猎野马”的大型狩猎方案。这个方案需要许多技艺超群的骑手，往各个方向上散开，彼此之间相隔着一定距离，并逐渐形成一个周长为两三英里的圆环，将野马群包围在里面。这种打围需要极度谨慎小心，因为野马是这片草原上最为警觉的居民，如果顺风，它们能在很远的地方就嗅到猎人的气味。</p></li>
<li><p>一旦包围圈形成，两三个骑手就冲向野马群，将它们赶到相反的方向。但是，当野马群靠近包围圈，便有一名猎手出现，将它们驱逐转向。就这样，野马群不管奔跑到哪里，都会被阻拦、驱逐，只能在这个魔圈里不停地驰骋转圈，直到彻底精疲力竭。这时，猎人们就很容易跟在野马群身边奔驰，将套索扔出，套在它们头上。但是，那些一流的野马极擅奔跑，具有超凡勇气与耐力，往往有能力突围逃走，因此，通常被捕获的都是品质稍劣的马匹。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，狩猎的准备工作已经完成。我们的驮马被带到树林里，牢牢地拴在树上，以免在野马奔驰过来的时候，它们也跟着挣脱逃走。接着，在一名中尉的率领下，二十五个男人悄悄沿着溪谷的边缘散开，山谷毗邻山脚下环山的条形状树林。那二十五人大约以五十码间隔距离布好位置，藏身在树林边缘，等到野马向他们这边飞奔过来，他们才能冒头拦阻。另外二十五人穿越溪谷，用同样的方式沿着对面的河岸边悄悄散开，同样藏身树林中间。</p></li>
<li><p>另外再派出数目大体相当的人，站成一列，横跨溪谷下游，以此连接包围圈的两翼。彼特和我们当中的另一名混血儿骑手安东尼，再加上总是多管闲事的法国佬托尼叙，他们三人将穿过树林，绕到溪谷上游，在野马群的背后出现，然后将它们驱赶进我们已经设伏好的包围圈里，而包围圈两翼也随之靠拢，形成一个完整的圆环。</p></li>
<li><p>侧翼的两只队伍已经沿着溪谷两端，悄无声息地散开了。剩下的人也散开了，他们负责填补整条包围圈中可能出现的缺口。这时，野马群发出信号，它们已经嗅到敌人的气味：它们嗅着空气，不停地喷着鼻息，环顾着四周。最后，野马们后足立地腾跃起来，三三两两地朝着河边小跑过去，消失在绿色的河岸边。</p></li>
<li><p>要是严格遵守围猎规则，这时野马群就会被树林里安静冒出的猎手所阻挡，然后转身退往另一个方向。然而，不幸的是，我们当中有个人坏了事，就是那个身材矮小的不靠谱的法国佬。他本应该在溪谷右侧安静地前进，到马群前方再开始行动；可是，当他看到野马群朝着河边跑去的时候，他一下冲出树林的藏身之处，疯狂地在草甸上追逐着它们。这下，整个打围计划就泡汤了，两个混血儿还有十名左右负责填补缺口的游猎者都加入了追逐。</p></li>
<li><p>野马群和追逐者都一路奔向绿色的河岸边。过了一会儿，野马又再度进入视线，闪电般往溪谷下游飞驰，那个法国佬、两个混血儿和游猎者跟在它们身后奔跑怒吼着，守在溪谷那条线上的猎手们根本无力将这群逃亡的野马驱逐回去。它们被身后的追逐者追得太紧，在恐慌中，野马群冲开包围圈，在平原上散开了。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，所有人都加入了这场不顾一切的追逐。有些猎手掉了帽子，头发在耳边四处飞舞，还有些人将手帕扎在头上。原本在牧草丛间安静休息的野牛，撑起它们庞大的身躯，朝着这场席卷着草甸的骚乱方向望了两眼，也转身逃跑了。它们身形沉重，奔跑时带着隐隐的轰响。它们很快就被赶上，现在，这群混杂的大部队被挤在狭窄的溪谷里，喧闹嘈杂，一片混乱。野牛和野马嘶吼着，疯狂的猎手们高喊着，森林里轰响成一片。</p></li>
<li><p>最后，野牛群一直跑到绿色的河岸边，骤然收住了蹄子，而此刻野马群却冲上山岭间的狭窄小径，后面的猎手们仍紧追不舍，离马群越来越近。彼特越过其中几匹野马，眼睛紧紧盯着一匹漂亮的波尼马，这匹马耳朵上有裂缝，背上还有鞍痕。彼特紧跟着它，然而，在穿越丛林的迅速奔跑中，那马转瞬间便不知所向。</p></li>
<li><p>在这群野马中，有一匹健壮的黑色母马在小径上绊倒了。一名年轻的猎手从他的马上扑过去，紧紧抓住它的鬃毛和口鼻。另一位猎手旋即下马，助他一臂之力。母马奋力地挣扎着，不停地猛踢猛咬，用前足踹打着，可一条套索套上它的头颈，顷刻之间，它的拼命挣扎徒劳无力。</p></li>
<li><p>然而，好大一会儿工夫，它才最终放弃朝四面八方猛烈的踢打。这两名猎手用两根粗壮的缰绳，一左一右地将它牵下溪谷。缰绳很长，好让他们能站在它的蹄子攻击不到的地方，每当它朝一个方向踢踹，另一边的猎手就会拉扯缰绳令它动弹不得。就这样，母马慢慢被驯服了。</p></li>
<li><p>至于那个鲁莽行事而打乱了整个围列计划的法国佬托尼叙，此行收获居然不小。他捕获了一匹漂亮的奶油色小马驹，大约七个月大，脚力跟不上它的同伴，这个精明矮小的法国佬兴高采烈地得意不已。看着他和他的战利品站在一起，实在引人发笑。小马后足乱踢乱蹬着，挣扎着想重新获得自由，而托尼叙则抱着它的脖子，使劲与它角力，跳上马背，做出各种滑稽可笑的动作，就好像一只和小猫搏斗的猴子。</p></li>
<li><p>这些可怜的野马被剥夺了大草原上无边无际的自由后，很快便驯服于人类。它们驯服的速度令我很吃惊，只过了两三天时间，那匹母马与小马便和我们的备用马混在一起，已经变得安静温顺了。</p></li>

<p>Adelaide Anne Procter (b. 1825, d. 1864) was the daughter of Bryan
Waller Procter (better known as “Barry Cornwall”), a celebrated English
poet, living in London. Miss Procter’s first volume, “Legends and
Lyrics,” appeared in 1858, and met with great success; it was
republished in this country. A second series, under the same name, was
published in 1860; and in 1862 both series were republished with
additional poems, and an introduction by Charles Dickens. In 1861 Miss
Procter edited “Victoria Regia,” a collection of poetical pieces, to
which she contributed; and in 1862 “A Chaplet of Verses,” composed of
her own poems, was published. Besides these volumes, she contributed
largely to various magazines and periodicals.</p>

<p>TAKING COMFORT</p>
<p>享受大自然</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For the last few days, the fine weather has led me away from
books and papers, and the close air of dwellings, into the open fields,
and under the soft, warm sunshine, and the softer light of a full moon.
The loveliest season of the whole year—that transient [1] but delightful
interval between the storms of the “wild equinox [2] , with all their
wet,” and the dark, short, dismal days which precede the rigor [3] of
winter—is now with us. The sun rises through a soft and hazy atmosphere;
the light mist clouds melt gradually before him; and his noontide light
rests warm and clear on still woods, tranquil waters, and grasses green
with the late autumnal rains.</p></li>
<li><p>One fine morning, not long ago, I strolled down the Merrimac, on
the Tewksbury shore. I know of no walk in the vicinity of Lowell so
inviting as that along the margin of the river, for nearly a mile from
the village of Belvidere. The path winds, green and flower-skirted,
among beeches and oaks, through whose boughs you catch glimpses of
waters sparkling and dashing below. Rocks, huge and picturesque [4] ,
jut out into the stream, affording beautiful views of the river and the
distant city.</p></li>
<li><p>Half fatigued with my walk, I threw myself down upon a rocky
slope of the bank, where the panorama [5] of earth, sky, and water lay
clear and distinct about me. Far above, silent and dim as a picture, was
the city, with its huge mill masonry, confused chimney tops, and church
spires; near it rose the height of Belvidere, with its deserted burial
place and neglected gravestones sharply defined on its bleak, bare
summit against the sky; before me the river went dashing down its rugged
channel, sending up its everlasting murmur; above me the birch tree hung
its tassels; and the last wild flowers of autumn profusely fringed the
rocky rim of the water.</p></li>
<li><p>Right opposite, the Dracut woods stretched upwards from the
shore, beautiful with the hues of frost, glowing with tints richer and
deeper than those which Claude or Poussin mingled, as if the rainbows of
a summer shower had fallen among them. At a little distance to the
right, a group of cattle stood mid-leg deep in the river; and a troop of
children, bright-eyed and mirthful, were casting pebbles at them from a
projecting shelf of rock. Over all a warm but softened sunshine melted
down from a slumberous autumnal sky.</p></li>
<li><p>My reverie [6] was disagreeably broken. A low, grunting sound,
half bestial [7] , half human, attracted my attention. I was not alone.
Close beside me, half hidden by a tuft of bushes, lay a human being,
stretched out at full length, with his face literally [8] rooted into
the gravel. A little boy, five or six years of age, clean and healthful,
with his fair brown locks and blue eyes, stood on the bank above, gazing
down upon him with an expression of childhood’s simple and unaffected
pity.</p></li>
<li><p>“What ails you?” asked the boy at length. “What makes you lie
there?”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The prostrate [9] groveler [10] struggled halfway up, exhibiting the
bloated [11] and filthy countenance of a drunkard. He made two or three
efforts to get upon his feet, lost his balance, and tumbled forward upon
his face.</p>
<p>“What are you doing there?” inquired the boy.</p>
<p>“I’m taking comfort,” he muttered, with his mouth in the dirt.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Taking his comfort! There he lay,—squalid and loathsome under the
bright heaven,—an imbruted [12] man. The holy harmonies [13] of Nature,
the sounds of gushing waters, the rustle of the leaves above him, the
wild flowers, the frost bloom of the woods,—what were they to him?
Insensible, deaf, and blind, in the stupor of a living death, he lay
there, literally realizing [14] that most bitterly significant eastern
malediction [15] , “May you eat dirt.”</li>

<li><p>在过去的几天里，晴朗的天气使我忍不住放下手中的书籍和论文，走出压抑沉闷的房间，走到户外，沐浴在温暖柔和的阳光中，以及满月恬淡的清辉里。正值一年中最佳季节——阴雨连绵、暴风雨大作的秋分刚刚过去，严冬之前的那段白昼短暂、晦暗阴郁的深秋还没来临。此刻，我们拥有一个短暂明媚的艳阳天。秋日的暖阳在柔软朦胧的薄雾中升起，袅袅云烟渐次散去；正午的阳光温暖清晰地照射在寂静的森林，甜美宁静的水面，还有刚被秋雨洗刷过的青翠草地上。</p></li>
<li><p>几天前，一个晴朗的早晨，我走在图克斯伯里河岸，沿着梅里马克河顺流而下悠闲散步。这条路离贝尔维迪尔村大约一英里，在我看来，除了这条沿着河流的小路以外，洛厄尔附近再没有一条路像它这么充满魅力。小路蜿蜒延伸，路边的草地绿意盎然，点缀着鲜花，山毛榉和橡树生长在路边，透过它们的枝桠，你可以看见波光粼粼的水面，水流湍急。岸边，巨大嶙峋的岩石突出到水上，站在上面，你能看到这条河流与远方城镇融为一体，风景如画。</p></li>
<li><p>半路走倦了，我索性在岸边一处石坡上坐下。在那里，周围的景色一览无余，只见天高地阔，河水清澈，围绕着我。极目望去，远方的城镇安静朦胧得像是一幅画：高大的磨坊石墙，吐着烟雾的高耸烟囱和教堂的尖塔。在城镇旁边，是贝尔维迪尔村的山坡，在天空衬托下，光秃秃的山顶上，那片荒凉墓地夹杂着被遗忘的棱角分明的墓碑，显得格外触目。眼前是沿着蜿蜒崎岖的河道湍急而下的河流，吟唱着一首经久不息的歌谣。身旁的白桦树枝繁叶茂，伸展在我头顶上，秋天最后的野花在岸边岩石的缝隙里烂漫地盛开着。</p></li>
<li><p>恰好河岸对面，德雷卡特树林从上游一直延伸到这里。树林里薄雾弥漫，折射出魔幻繁杂的色彩，远比克劳德或普桑笔下晕染的画布更深邃漂亮，简直就像一道夏季彩虹落在林间似的。右边稍远点的地方，牛群站在没膝的河水中；旁边有一群孩子，开心地嬉闹着，从身边捡起小石子，朝着牛群丢去。秋天温暖的阳光慵懒地洒下，将一切都温柔地融化了。</p></li>
<li><p>突然，一声低沉的咕哝打断了我的遐想，让我略感不快，一个看起来半兽半人的家伙吸引了我的注意。原来这里并不只有我一个人，就在我身边的一簇灌木丛里，躺着一个人，他的半个身体都被灌木丛遮蔽了。他四肢摊开，脸简直就是埋在砾石里。一个五六岁左右的小男孩，看起来干净健康，有着一头棕褐色头发和蓝色的眼睛，站在岸边的石头上，上下打量着他，眼里满是孩子般的单纯与怜悯。</p></li>
<li><p>“你身体不舒服吗？”终于，那个男孩问道，“你为什么躺在那里？”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>那个匍匐在地的男人挣扎着欠起身，一副醉醺醺酒鬼的污秽嘴脸。他踉跄着想站起来，尝试了两三次，最终还是失去平衡，脸朝下跌在地上。</p>
<p>“你在那里做什么？”男孩问。</p>
<p>“我在享受大自然。”他的嘴角贴着泥土，嘟囔着说。</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>享受大自然！他躺在那里，浑身污秽不堪，令人厌恶，一如行尸走肉——躺在这湛蓝如洗的天空下！这大自然神圣的和谐，喷涌不歇的河水，他头顶上沙沙作响的树叶，漫地灿烂的野花，树林间淡淡的薄雾——所有这些美好对他意味着什么？这个毫无感觉的、目不能视、耳不能闻、昏昏沉沉的活死人！他就这么僵卧在那里，像是应验了那句充满怨恨的东方诅咒：“啃你的土去吧。”</li>

<p>Charles Frederick Briggs (b. 1804, d. 1877) was born on the island of
Nantucket. When quite young, however, he became a resident of New York
City. In 1845, in conjunction with Edgar A. Poe, he began the
publication of the “Broadway Journal;” he was also connected with the
“New York Times,” and the “Evening Mirror;” also as editor from 1853 to
1856 with “Putnam’s Magazine.” Mr. Briggs wrote a few novels, some
poetry, and numerous little humorous tales and sketches. The following
selection is from “Working a Passage; or, Life on a Liner,” one of his
best stories.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Among the luxuries which the captain had provided for himself and
passengers was a fine green turtle, which was not likely to suffer from
exposure to salt water, so it was reserved [1] until all the pigs, and
sheep, and poultry had been eaten. A few days before we arrived, it was
determined to kill the turtle and have a feast the next day.</p></li>
<li><p>Our cabin gentlemen had been long enough deprived of fresh meats
to make them cast lickerish [2] glances towards their hard-skinned
friend, and there was a great smacking of lips the day before he was
killed. As I walked aft [3] occasionally, I heard them congratulating
themselves on their prospective [4] turtle soup and forcemeat [5] balls;
and one of them, to heighten the luxury of the feast, ate nothing but a
dry biscuit for the twenty-four hours preceding, that he might be
prepared to devour his full share of the unctuous [6] compound.</p></li>
<li><p>It was to be a gala day with them; and though it was not
champagne day, that falling on Saturday and this on Friday, they agreed
to have champagne a day in advance, that nothing should be wanting to
give a finish to their turtle. It happened to be a rougher day than
usual when the turtle was cooked, but they had become too well used to
the motion of the ship to mind that.</p></li>
<li><p>It happened to be my turn at the wheel the hour before dinner,
and I had the tantalizing misery of hearing them laughing and talking
about their turtle, while I was hungry from want of dry bread and salt
meat. I had resolutely kept my thoughts from the cabin during all the
passage but once, and now I found my ideas clustering round a tureen of
turtle in spite of all my philosophy.</p></li>
<li><p>Confound them, if they had gone out of my hearing with their
exulting smacks, I should not have envied their soup, but their hungry
glee so excited my imagination that I could see nothing through the
glazing [7] of the binnacle [8] but a white plate with a slice of lemon
on the rim, a loaf of delicate bread, a silver spoon, a napkin, two or
three wine glasses of different hues and shapes, and a water goblet
clustering round it, and a stream of black, thick, and fragrant turtle
pouring into the plate.</p></li>
<li><p>By and by it was four bells [9] : they dined at three. And all
the gentlemen, with the captain at their head, darted below into the
cabin, where their mirth increased when they caught sight of the soup
plates. “Hurry with the soup, steward,” roared the captain. “Coming,
sir,” replied the steward. In a few moments the cook opened the door of
his galley [10] , and out came the delicious steam of the
turtle.</p></li>
<li><p>Then came the steward with a large covered tureen [11] in his
hand, towards the cabin gangway [12] . I forgot the ship for a moment in
looking at this precious cargo, the wheel slipped from my hands, the
ship broached to with a sudden jerk; the steward had got only one foot
upon the stairs, when this unexpected motion threw him off his balance,
and down he went by the run, the tureen slipped from his hands, and part
of its contents flew into the lee [13] scuppers [14] , and the balance
followed him in his fall.</p></li>
<li><p>I laughed outright. I enjoyed the turtle a thousand times more
than I should have done if I had eaten the whole of it. But I was forced
to restrain my mirth, for the next moment the steward ran upon deck,
followed by the captain, in a furious rage, threatening if he caught him
to throw him overboard. Not a spoonful of the soup had been left in the
coppers [15] , for the steward had taken it all away at once to keep it
warm. In about an hour afterwards the passengers came upon deck, looking
more sober than I had seen them since we left Liverpool. They had dined
upon cold ham.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>船上那只漂亮的绿毛龟有幸列入美味佳肴的名单，那是船长为旅客们及他本人所准备的，那种龟不可能在海水里喂养。因此，等到所有的猪羊鸡鸭悉数消耗殆尽，绿毛龟引起了饕餮们的热情关注。轮船眼看几天后就要抵达目的地了，船长决定，第二天便宰掉这只绿毛龟，让大家好好美餐一顿。</p></li>
<li><p>客舱里的旅客们都已经很久没尝过新鲜肉味了，因此，当这个消息传开的时候，每个人都将目光投向这位长有硬壳的朋友，眼里冒出饥渴绿光，垂涎欲滴。那头龟却是如此不谙人事，嘴里不时发出的吧咂声响亮依旧。我偶尔走到船尾，总会听到他们兴高采烈地讨论着期待中的甲鱼汤，还有喷香的龟肉丸。有位绅士为了这场豪华的盛宴，接下来整整一天的时间只啃了块硬饼干，好让自己到时候充分享受到那份鲜美醇厚的甲鱼汤。</p></li>
<li><p>宰杀绿毛龟那天，对大家来说都是喜庆洋洋的一天。虽然周六才是喝香槟的日子，那天是周五，但绅士们一致赞同将香槟日提前一天，这样在享受甲鱼汤的美味时就不会留下任何遗憾。当甲鱼下锅的时候，海上的风浪碰巧也比平常要大，但大家对船上颠簸早已习以为常，丝毫不以此为意。</p></li>
<li><p>晚餐前，碰巧轮到我掌舵。于是，我就只能听大家谈笑风生地讨论着他们的甲鱼汤，而饥肠辘辘的我却只想弄点儿面包干和腌肉充饥，那种诱惑实在痛苦难挨。从走廊经过的时候，我竭尽全力不去想餐厅里即将发生的这顿美食，只走神了一次——现在，我所有的自制力都被瓦解了，满脑子里都是这碗诱人的甲鱼汤。</p></li>
<li><p>真见鬼！要是我听不到他们这些欢呼雀跃的讨论声，也许我还不至于对这碗甲鱼汤垂涎欲滴，但他们饥肠辘辘的狂喜刺激了我的想象力：当我盯着眼前的罗盘表，竟然发现里面另有一番天地，白色的餐盘上摆着一片柠檬，一块松软的面包，一把银勺，一方餐巾，两个或三个不同形状和色调的葡萄酒杯，还有一杯装着水的高脚酒杯。最后，那道黑色稠滑、香味扑鼻的甲鱼汤优雅地倒入素白瓷盘
。</p></li>
<li><p>进餐原定三点开始，时间一分一秒地过去，现在已经是两点了。在船长带领下，一群人纷纷冲进舷下餐厅。一看到桌上的餐盘，他们戏谑调侃，热闹成团。“服务生，把汤端上来吧！”船长朗声喊道。“来了，先生们！”服务生回答道。过了几分钟，厨师打开厨房的门，甲鱼汤诱人的香气便飘了出来。</p></li>
<li><p>接着，服务生手里捧着一个大号的盖碗，朝着餐厅舷梯的方向走来。我直勾勾地望着这一大碗美味的食物，一时忘了手中的舵轮。舵轮从我手中滑落，船猛地横转船体，引起一场突然的颠簸。服务生才将一只脚迈上舷梯，这场始料未及的颠簸令他失去平衡，他啪地摔倒在地，那个盖碗也脱了手。盖碗里的一部分肉块汤水径直飞入排水孔里，剩下的，则散落在他的身旁。</p></li>
<li><p>我畅快地大笑起来。现在这个时刻我所享受到的美妙感觉，要比让我吃掉整只绿毛龟更快乐一千倍。但是，我不得不压抑自己的笑声，因为那边服务生很快跑上甲板，大发雷霆的船长紧跟在他身后，愤怒地威胁着，要是让他抓住，他一定会把服务生扔进海里。厨房里一滴甲鱼汤都没剩下，因为服务生担心汤凉了，便将甲鱼汤一次性全都装到盖碗里。大约一个小时后，乘客们才纷纷走上甲板，这大概是自从游船在利物浦港口启航后，我见过的他们最冷静清醒的一刻。在那以后，他们便一直用冷火腿填腹。</p></li>

<p>THE BEST KIND OF REVENGE</p>
<p>最好的复仇</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Some years ago a warehouseman [1] in Manchester, England,
published a scurrilous [2] pamphlet, in which he endeavored to hold up
the house of Grant Brothers to ridicule. William Grant remarked upon the
occurrence that the man would live to repent of what he had done; and
this was conveyed by some talebearer to the libeler [3] , who said, “Oh,
I suppose he thinks I shall some time or other be in his debt; but I
will take good care of that.” It happens, however, that a man in
business can not always choose who shall be his creditors. The
pamphleteer became a bankrupt, and the brothers held an acceptance of
his which had been indorsed to them by the drawer, who had also become a
bankrupt.</p></li>
<li><p>The wantonly libeled men had thus become creditors of the
libeler! They now had it in their power to make him repent of his
audacity [4] . He could not obtain his certificate without their
signature [5] , and without it he could not enter into business again.
He had obtained the number of signatures required by the bankrupt law
except one. It seemed folly to hope that the firm of “the brothers”
would supply the deficiency [6] . What! they who had cruelly been made
the laughingstock of the public, forget the wrong and favor the
wrongdoer? He despaired. But the claims of a wife and children forced
him at last to make the application. Humbled by misery, he presented
himself at the countinghouse of the wronged.</p></li>
<li><p>Mr. William Grant was there alone, and his first words to the
delinquent [7] were, “Shut the door, sir!” sternly uttered. The door was
shut, and the libeler stood trembling before the libeled. He told his
tale and produced his certificate, which was instantly clutched by the
injured merchant. “You wrote a pamphlet against us once!” exclaimed
Mr. Grant. The suppliant expected to see his parchment [8] thrown into
the fire. But this was not its destination. Mr. Grant took a pen, and
writing something upon the document, handed it back to the bankrupt. He,
poor wretch, expected to see “rogue, scoundrel, libeler,” inscribed; but
there was, in fair round characters, the signature of the firm.</p></li>
<li><p>“We make it a rule,” said Mr. Grant, “never to refuse signing the
certificate of an honest tradesman, and we have never heard that you
were anything else.” The tears started into the poor man’s eyes. “Ah,”
said Mr. Grant, “my saying was true! I said you would live to repent
writing that pamphlet. I did not mean it as a threat. I only meant that
some day you would know us better, and be sorry you had tried to injure
us. I see you repent of it now.” “I do, I do!” said the grateful man; “I
bitterly repent it.” “Well, well, my dear fellow, you know us now. How
do you get on? What are you going to do?” The poor man stated he had
friends who could assist him when his certificate was obtained. “But how
are you off in the meantime?”</p></li>
<li><p>And the answer was, that, having given up every farthing to his
creditors, he had been compelled to stint [9] his family of even common
necessaries, that he might be enabled to pay the cost of his
certificate. “My dear fellow, this will not do; your family must not
suffer. Be kind enough to take this ten-pound note to your wife from me.
There, there, my dear fellow! Nay, do not cry; it will all be well with
you yet. Keep up your spirits, set to work like a man, and you will
raise your head among us yet.” The overpowered man endeavored in vain to
express his thanks; the swelling in his throat forbade words. He put his
handkerchief to his face and went out of the door, crying like a
child.</p></li>

<li><p>前些年，英国曼彻斯特的一位羊毛制品批发商出版了一本充满粗鄙辱骂的小册子，文章中肆无忌惮地公开嘲笑格兰特兄弟公司。威廉·格兰特对此发表评论，说这名男子迟早会为他所做的事后悔一生。这句话被某个搬弄是非的人转达给那位诽谤者，后者说：“哦，我猜想威廉·格兰特大概认为，我迟早有一天会欠他的钱。对此，他大可放心，我一定会加倍小心的。”然而，商场上瞬息万变，一个商人总是无法选择谁会成为自己的债权人：这本小册子的作者破产了，他的债权人随后也破产了，并将这笔债权背书转让给格兰特兄弟。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，被中伤者竟然成为毁谤者的债权人！格兰特兄弟现在完全有能力让这家伙为自己的厚颜无耻埋单。没有债权人的签字认可，他的营业执照就无法生效；营业执照不生效，他就无法重新开业。现在，他已经拿到破产法所要求他获取的所有签名，只剩下格兰特公司这一个了。想让格兰特兄弟公司为他签字，似乎愚蠢至极。天哪！难道不是他残忍地让格兰特兄弟被公众当成笑柄？现在，他竟然想让这些被恶意对待的人原谅他的过错？他绝望了。但是来自妻子和孩子们的压力，迫使他终究还是要递出申请。怀着绝望和谦卑的心情，他来到格兰特兄弟的公司门前。</p></li>
<li><p>威廉·格兰特先生独自在办公室里，他对欠债者说出的第一句话便是：“关上门，先生！”语气相当严厉。门关上了，那位诽谤者战战兢兢地站在被毁谤者面前。他说出此行的目的，拿出了自己的营业执照。遭受肆意诬陷的威廉·格兰特一把攫住这张执照，高声叫道：“你曾经写过一个宣传册恶意毁谤过我们！”听到这样的话，那位恳求者以为他的羊皮纸下一秒就会被扔进火堆。然而，事情结局大出所料。格兰特先生取出一支笔，在文件上写了些什么，将它递给那名破产者。这个可怜的穷光蛋以为会看到
一些“流氓、无赖、诽谤者”之类的字样。但是，他万万没有想到，那张羊皮纸上，赫然是字体圆润的格兰特公司签名。</p></li>
<li><p>“我们立下规矩，”格兰特先生说，“绝不会拒绝为一个诚信的商人签署证书，我们从未听说过你曾有过任何不诚信的行为。”这个可怜的人泪水盈满眼眶。“啊，”格兰特先生说，“但我所说的是真心话。我说你迟早会后悔自己曾写过毁谤我们的宣传册，这并不是在威胁你。我的意思是，总有一天，当你更加了解我们的时候，你会对曾试图伤害我们更感到后悔。现在，我看你已经悔过了。”“是的，是的！”这个感激涕零的人说，“我尝到了后悔的苦涩。”“好了，好了，我亲爱的朋友，你现在已经更了解我们了。接下来，你有什么打算？你准备做些什么？”那可怜的的家伙说，一旦他的营业执照开始生效后，他的朋友们便可以帮他。“那在挣到钱之前，你这段时间怎么办？”</p></li>
<li><p>这个批发商说，他被迫省吃俭用，节省所有可能的家庭开销，把所有省下的钱都支付给债权人，这样才能支付起营业执照的成本。“亲爱的朋友，这样不行，你的家人不该这样受罪！这是一张十英镑的支票，请帮个忙，代我转交给你的妻子。拿着，收下吧，亲爱的朋友！好了，不要哭了，一切都会好起来的。振作精神，像个男人一样努力工作，你一定会在我们中间重新昂起头。”这个无法控制自己情绪的男人竭力想表达他的感激之情，却哽咽得一句话都说不出来。他用手帕捂住自己的脸，走出门，像个孩子一样号啕大哭起来。</p></li>

<p>Caroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton (b. 1808, d. 1877) was the
granddaughter of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. She wrote verses and plays
at a very early age. “The Sorrows of Rosalie,” published in 1829, was
written before she was seventeen years old. In 1827 she was married to
the Hon. George Chapple Norton. The marriage was an unhappy one, and
they were divorced in 1836. Her principal works are “The Undying One,”
“The Dream, and Other Poems,” “The Child of the Islands,” “Stuart of
Dunleith, a Romance,” and “English Laws for English Women of the 19th
Century.” She contributed extensively to the magazines and other
periodicals.</p>
<p>1.A soldier of the Legion [1] lay dying in Algiers, There was lack of
woman’s nursing, there was dearth [2] of woman’s tears;</p>
<p>But a comrade stood beside him, while his lifeblood ebbed [3] away,
And bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might say.</p>
<p>The dying soldier faltered, as he took that comrade’s hand, And he
said: “I nevermore shall see my own, my native land;</p>
<p>Take a message and a token to some distant friends of mine, For I was
born at Bingen,—at Bingen on the Rhine.</p>
<p>2.“Tell my brothers and companions, when they meet and crowd around
To hear my mournful story in the pleasant vineyard ground, That we
fought the battle bravely, and when the day was done, Full many a corse
[4] lay ghastly pale beneath the setting sun;</p>
<p>And, ’mid the dead and dying, were some grown old in wars,—The death
wound on their gallant breasts, the last of many scars;</p>
<p>But some were young, and suddenly beheld life’s morn decline,—And one
had come from Bingen,—fair Bingen on the Rhine.</p>
<p>3.“Tell my mother that her other sons shall comfort her old age, For
I was aye a truant bird, that thought his home a cage.</p>
<p>For my father was a soldier, and, even when a child, My heart leaped
forth to hear him tell of struggles fierce and wild;</p>
<p>And when he died, and left us to divide his scanty hoard, I let them
take whate’er they would, but kept my father’s sword;</p>
<p>And with boyish love I hung it where the bright light used to shine,
On the cottage wall at Bingen,—calm Bingen on the Rhine.</p>
<p>4.“Tell my sister not to weep for me, and sob with drooping head,
When the troops come marching home again, with glad and gallant tread,
But to look upon them proudly, with a calm and steadfast [5] eye, For
her brother was a soldier, too, and not afraid to die;</p>
<p>And if a comrade seek her love, I ask her in my name To listen to him
kindly, without regret or shame, And to hang the old sword in its place
(my father’s sword and mine), For the honor of old Bingen,—dear Bingen
on the Rhine.</p>
<p>5.“There’s another,—not a sister; in the happy days gone by, You’d
have known her by the merriment that sparkled in her eye;</p>
<p>Too innocent for coquetry [6] ,—too fond for idle scorning,—O friend!
I fear the lightest heart makes sometimes heaviest mourning!</p>
<p>Tell her the last night of my life—(for, ere the moon be risen, My
body will be out of pain, my soul be out of prison), I dreamed I stood
with her, and saw the yellow sunlight shine On the vine-clad hills of
Bingen,—fair Bingen on the Rhine.</p>
<p>6.“I saw the blue Rhine sweep along: I heard, or seemed to hear, The
German songs we used to sing, in chorus sweet and clear;</p>
<p>And down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill, The echoing
chorus [7] sounded, through the evening calm and still;</p>
<p>And her glad blue eyes were on me, as we passed, with friendly talk,
Down many a path beloved of yore [8] , and well-remembered walk;</p>
<p>And her little hand lay lightly, confidingly in mine,— But we’ll meet
no more at Bingen,—loved Bingen on the Rhine.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>His trembling voice grew faint and hoarse; his grasp was childish
weak, His eyes put on a dying look,—he sighed and ceased to speak.</li>
</ol>
<p>His comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had fled,— The
soldier of the Legion in a foreign land was dead!</p>
<p>And the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down On the
red sand of the battlefield, with bloody corses strewn;</p>
<p>Yes, calmly on that dreadful scene, her pale light seemed to shine,
As it shone on distant Bingen,—fair Bingen on the Rhine.</p>

<p>Charles Sprague (b. 1791, d. 1875) was born in Boston, Mass. He
engaged in mercantile business when quite young, leaving school for that
purpose. In 1825, he was elected cashier of the Globe Bank of Boston,
which position he held until 1864. Mr. Sprague has not been a prolific
writer; but his poems, though few in number, are deservedly classed

<p>查尔斯·斯普拉格（1791—1875）出生于美国马萨诸塞州波士顿。他少年时代便离开学校，从事商业贸易。
1825年，他成为波士顿环球银行的一名出纳员，并在这个职位上一直工作到1864年。斯普拉格先生并不是一位多产的作家，然而，虽然他的诗歌数量很少，却当之无愧地荣列于最好的美国诗歌作品之列。他的代表作品是诗歌《好奇心》。</p>

<p>暴躁易怒的妻子</p>
<p>Maria Edgeworth (b. 1767, d. 1849) was born near Reading. Berkshire,
England. In 1782 her father removed with his family to Edgeworthtown,
Ireland, to reside on his estate. She lived here during the remainder of
her life, with the exception of occasional short visits to England,
Scotland, and France. She was educated principally by her father, and
they were colaborers in literary productions, among which were “Essays
on Practical Education,” and the “Parent’s Assistant.” Her novels and
tales were written without assistance, and her fame as a writer rests on
them. The best known of these are “Castle Rackrent,” “Moral Tales,”
“Tales of Fashionable Life,” “Frank,” “The Modern Griselda,” and
“Helen.” Miss Edgeworth excels in the truthful delineation of character,
and her works are full of practical good sense and genuine humor.</p>
<p>Mrs . Bolingbroke . I wish I knew what was the matter with me this
morning.</p>
<p>Why do you keep the newspaper all to yourself, my dear?</p>
<p>Mr . Bolingbroke. Here it is for you, my dear; I have finished
it.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . I humbly thank you for giving it to me when you have done
with it. I hate stale news. Is there anything in the paper? for I can
not be at the trouble of hunting it.</p>
<p>Mr . B . Yes, my dear; there are the marriages of two of our
friends.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Who? Who?</p>
<p>Mr . B . Your friend, the widow Nettleby, to her cousin John
Nettleby.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Mrs. Nettleby? Dear! But why did you tell me?</p>
<p>Mr . B . Because you asked me, my dear.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Oh, but it is a hundred times pleasanter to read the
paragraph one’s self. One loses all the pleasure of the surprise by
being told. Well, whose was the other marriage?</p>
<p>Mr . B . Oh, my dear, I will not tell you; I will leave you the
pleasure of the surprise.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . But you see I can not find it. How provoking you are, my
dear! Do pray tell me.</p>
<p>Mr . B . Our friend Mr. Granby.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Mr. Granby? Dear! Why did you not make me guess? I should
have guessed him directly. But why do you call him our friend? I am sure
he is no friend of mine, nor ever was. I took an aversion to him, as you
remember, the very first day I saw him. I am sure he is no friend of
mine.</p>
<p>Mr . B . I am sorry for it, my dear; but I hope you will go and see
Mrs. Granby.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Not I, indeed, my dear. Who was she?</p>
<p>Mr . B . Miss Cooke.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Cooke? But, there are so many Cookes. Can’t you distinguish
her any way? Has she no Christian name?</p>
<p>Mr . B . Emma, I think. Yes, Emma.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Emma Cooke? No; it can not be my friend Emma Cooke; for I
am sure she was cut out for an old maid.</p>
<p>Mr . B . This lady seems to me to be cut out for a good wife.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Maybe so. I am sure I’ll never go to see her. Pray, my
dear, how came you to see so much of her?</p>
<p>Mr . B . I have seen very little of her, my dear. I only saw her two
or three times before she was married.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Then, my dear, how could you decide that she was cut out
for a good wife? I am sure you could not judge of her by seeing her only
two or three times, and before she was married.</p>
<p>Mr . B . Indeed, my love, that is a very just observation.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . I understand that compliment perfectly, and thank you for
it, my dear. I must own I can bear anything better than irony [1] .</p>
<p>Mr . B . Irony? my dear, I was perfectly in earnest.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Yes, yes; in earnest; so I perceive; I may naturally be
dull of apprehension, but my feelings are quick enough; I comprehend too
well. Yes, it is impossible to judge of a woman before marriage, or to
guess what sort of a wife she will make. I presume you speak from
experience; you have been disappointed yourself, and repent your
choice.</p>
<p>Mr . B . My dear, what did I say that was like this? Upon my word, I
meant no such thing. I really was not thinking of you in the least.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . No, you never think of me now. I can easily believe that
you were not thinking of me in the least.</p>
<p>Mr . B . But I said that only to prove to you that I could not be
thinking ill of you, my dear.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . But I would rather that you thought ill of me than that you
should not think of me at all.</p>
<p>Mr . B . Well, my dear, I will even think ill of you if that will
please you.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . Do you laugh at me? When it comes to this I am wretched
indeed. Never man laughed at the woman he loved. As long as you had the
slightest remains of love for me you could not make me an object of
derision [2] ; ridicule and love are incompatible [3] , absolutely
incompatible. Well, I have done my best, my very best, to make you
happy, but in vain. I see I am not cut out to be a good wife. Happy,
happy Mrs. Granby!</p>
<p>Mr . B . Happy, I hope sincerely, that she will be with my friend;
but my happiness must depend on you, my love; so, for my sake, if not
for your own, be composed, and do not torment yourself with such
fancies.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . I do wonder whether this Mrs. Granby is really that Miss
Emma</p>
<p>Cooke. I’ll go and see her directly; see her I must.</p>
<p>Mr . B . I am heartily glad of it, my dear; for I am sure a visit to
his wife will give my friend Granby real pleasure.</p>
<p>Mrs . B . I promise you, my dear, I do not go to give him pleasure,
or you either, but to satisfy my own curiosity.</p>

1782年，她的父亲举家迁往爱尔兰埃奇沃斯镇，居住在他们的祖传庄园里。她随后在这里居住终生，除了偶尔到英格兰、苏格兰和法国短期旅游以外。玛丽亚主要从她的父亲那里接受教育，他们共同创作了一些作品，包括《关于实践性教育的随笔》、《父母的助手》等。她的小说和故事均独自完成，并因这些作品而奠定她的文学声望，其中最为著名的作品有《拉克伦特城堡》、《道德寓言》、《时尚生活的故事》、《弗兰克》、《时髦的格瑞瑟达》和《海伦》。埃奇沃斯小姐擅长于刻画人物真实性格，她的作品极富现实意义，文字妙趣横生。</p>
<p>博林布鲁克夫人：今天早上真是活见鬼了，做什么都不顺。亲爱的，你怎么一直拿着报纸不放？</p>
<p>博林布鲁克先生：亲爱的，给你，我看完了。</p>
<p>夫人：你看完了才递给我，我真该对你感激涕零。我讨厌过时的新闻。报纸上有什么消息吗？我可不想费神寻找。</p>
<p>先生：是的，亲爱的，我们有两对朋友结婚了。</p>
<p>夫人：谁？谁结婚了？</p>
<p>先生：你的朋友，寡妇奈特比夫人，嫁给她远房表亲约翰·奈特比。</p>
<p>夫人：奈特比夫人？亲爱的！你干吗要告诉我这些？</p>
<p>先生：是你问我的，亲爱的。</p>
<p>夫人：哦，可是自己从报纸上读到这些消息要比从别人嘴里听到有趣得多，你可把我的惊喜都夺走啦。算了算了，另一对呢？</p>
<p>先生：亲爱的，我不会告诉你，我可不愿再夺走你的惊喜。</p>
<p>夫人：可你看，我根本就找不到它，你怎么这么烦人呢，亲爱的！快告诉我。</p>
<p>先生：我们的朋友格兰比先生。</p>
<p>夫人：格兰比先生？亲爱的！为什么你不让我猜猜呢？你要是让我猜的话，我肯定一下就猜中了。可你为什么把他称为我们的朋友？至少我知道，他不是我的朋友，从来就不是。你该记得，我第一次见到他的时候，我就开始厌恶他了，他可绝不是我的朋友。</p>
<p>先生：对不起，亲爱的，不过我还是希望你能去见见格兰比夫人。</p>
<p>夫人：我可不去，真的，亲爱的。不过，她是谁呀？</p>
<p>先生：库克小姐。</p>
<p>夫人：库克？但是，姓库克的人太多了，你难道记不住什么特别的？她没有教名吗？</p>
<p>先生：好像是艾玛，我想想。噢，是的，艾玛。</p>
<p>夫人：艾玛·库克？不，不可能是我朋友艾玛·库克，我确定，她可是个天生注定的老处女。</p>
<p>先生：我倒觉得，这位女士是个天生的好妻子。</p>
<p>夫人：也许吧，我只知道我是绝不会去看她的。话说回来，亲爱的，你怎么有机会见过她这么多次？</p>
<p>先生：我很少见到她，亲爱的。在她结婚前，我只见过她两三次。</p>
<p>夫人：既然这样，亲爱的，你怎么就能断定她是个天生的好妻子？既然她结婚前，你只见过她两三次，我可看不出你有什么判断依据。</p>
<p>先生：你说的对，宝贝儿，你的观察很仔细。</p>
<p>夫人：我太清楚你的恭维了，亲爱的，谢谢了。我必须承认，我什么都能吃得住，就是受不了你的冷嘲热讽。</p>
<p>先生：冷嘲热讽？亲爱的，我那句话是真心的。</p>
<p>夫人：是，是，真心的，我听起来也是这样。我可能天生愚钝，可我的直觉特别准，领悟力超强。我是对的，一个女人结婚前根本无法判断她是个怎样的女人，或是猜到她将是个怎样的妻子。所以，你会那么说，看来是有感而发：你对你自己的婚姻失望了，你在后悔当初的选择。</p>
<p>先生：亲爱的，我说了什么，让你产生这种想法？我一点这种意思都没有啊！说那句话的时候，我根本都没有想到过你。</p>
<p>夫人：那当然了，甚至现在你都没在想我。你说你刚才根本都没想到过我，这话我信。</p>
<p>先生：可是，我刚才说的只不过向你表明，我不可能把你想歪了，亲爱的。</p>
<p>夫人：可是，我宁可你把我想歪，也比你一点不想我要强。</p>
<p>先生：好吧，亲爱的。如果能让你开心的话，那我就把你想歪吧。</p>
<p>夫人：你在嘲笑我吗？话说到这份儿上，我也太可怜了。没有一个男人会嘲笑他心爱的女人，哪怕你心里还有一丝对我的爱意，你就不会这么嘲笑我。嘲讽与爱从来都是不相容的，水火不容。算了，我尽了最大努力，使出浑身解数地讨你开心，到最后，全是徒劳。我算看清了，我天生就不是个好妻子。幸福去吧，快乐去吧，见鬼的格兰比夫人！</p>
<p>先生：我真诚地希望，她能与我的朋友幸福美满。但我的幸福当然取决于你，宝贝儿。所以，为了我，哪怕不是为你自己，静下心来，别用这些念头来折磨自己了。</p>
<p>夫人：我就是想弄清楚，这个格兰比夫人到底是不是艾玛·库克小姐。我现在就去，我必须得去。</p>
<p>先生：亲爱的，听你这么说，我真高兴。我相信你去拜访格兰比夫人，会让我朋友格兰比开心坏的。</p>
<p>夫人：我告诉你，亲爱的，我去他家，可不是为了让你的朋友开心，也不在乎你是否高兴，我就是想亲眼看看这个格兰比夫人究竟长什么样。</p>

<p>Alfred Tennyson (b. 1809, d. 1892) was born in Somersby,
Lincolnshire, England. He graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge. His
first volume of poems was published in 1830, but it made little
impression and was severely criticised. On the publication of his third
series in 1842, his poetic genius began to receive general recognition.
Mr. Tennyson was made poet laureate in 1850, and was regarded as the
foremost living poet of England. For several years his residence was on
the Isle of Wight. In 1884, he was raised to the peerage.</p>

<p>TRANSPORTATION AND PLANTING OF SEEDS</p>

<p>Henry David Thoreau (b. 1817, d. 1862). This eccentric American
author and naturalist was born at Concord, Mass. He graduated at Harvard
University in 1837. He was a good English and classical scholar, and was
well acquainted with the literature of the East. His father was a maker
of lead pencils, and he followed the business for a time, but afterwards
supported himself mainly by teaching, lecturing, land surveying, and
carpentering. In 1845 he built himself a small wooden house near
Concord, on the shore of Walden Pond, where he lived about two years. He
was intimate with Hawthorne, Emerson, and other literary celebrities.
His principal works are “Walden, or Life in the Woods,” “A Week on
Concord and Merrimac Rivers,” “Excursions,” “Maine Woods,” “Cape Cod,”
“A Yankee in Canada,” and “Letters to Various Persons.” In descriptive
power Mr. Thoreau has few, if any, superiors.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In all the pines a very thin membrane [1] , in appearance much
like an insect’s wing, grows over and around the seed, and independent
of it, while the latter is being developed within its base. In other
words, a beautiful thin sack is woven around the seed, with a handle to
it such as the wind can take hold of, and it is then committed to the
wind, expressly that it may transport the seed and extend the range of
the species; and this it does as effectually as when seeds are sent by
mail, in a different kind of sack, from the patent office.</p></li>
<li><p>There is, then, no necessity for supposing that the pines have
sprung up from nothing, and I am aware that I am not at all peculiar in
asserting that they come from seeds, though the mode of their
propagation [2] by Nature has been but little attended to. They are very
extensively raised from the seed in Europe, and are beginning to be
here.</p></li>
<li><p>When you cut down an oak wood, a pine wood will not at once
spring up there unless there are, or have been quite recently,
seed-bearing pines near enough for the seeds to be blown from them. But,
adjacent to a forest of pines, if you prevent other crops from growing
there, you will surely have an extension of your pine forest, provided
the soil is suitable.</p></li>
<li><p>As I walk amid hickories, even in August, I hear the sound of
green pignuts falling from time to time, cut off by the chickaree over
my head. In the fall I notice on the ground, either within or in the
neighborhood of oak woods, on all sides of the town, stout oak twigs
three or four inches long, bearing half a dozen empty acorn cups, which
twigs have been gnawed off by squirrels, on both sides of the nuts, in
order to make them more portable [3] . The jays scream and the red
squirrels scold while you are clubbing and shaking the chestnut trees,
for they are there on the same errand, and two of a trade never
agree.</p></li>
<li><p>I frequently see a red or a gray squirrel cast down a green
chestnut burr, as I am going through the woods, and I used to think,
sometimes, that they were cast at me. In fact, they are so busy about
it, in the midst of the chestnut season, that you can not stand long in
the woods without hearing one fall.</p></li>
<li><p>A sportsman told me that he had, the day before—that was in the
middle of October—seen a green chestnut burr dropped on our great river
meadow, fifty rods from the nearest wood, and much farther from the
nearest chestnut tree, and he could not tell how it came there.
Occasionally, when chestnutting in midwinter, I find thirty or forty
nuts in a pile, left in its gallery just under the leaves, by the common
wood mouse.</p></li>
<li><p>But especially, in the winter, the extent to which this
transportation [4] and planting of nuts is carried on, is made apparent
by the snow. In almost every wood you will see where the red or gray
squirrels have pawed down through the snow in a hundred places,
sometimes two feet deep, and almost always directly to a nut or a pine
cone, as directly as if they had started from it and bored upward,—which
you and I could not have done. It would be difficult for us to find one
before the snow falls. Commonly, no doubt, they had deposited them there
in the fall. You wonder if they remember the localities or discover them
by the scent.</p></li>
<li><p>The red squirrel commonly has its winter abode in the earth under
a thicket of evergreens, frequently under a small clump of evergreens in
the midst of a deciduous [5] wood. If there are any nut trees, which
still retain their nuts, standing at a distance without the wood, their
paths often lead directly to and from them. We, therefore, need not
suppose an oak standing here and there in the wood in order to seed it,
but if a few stand within twenty or thirty rods of it, it is
sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>I think that I may venture to say that every white-pine cone that
falls to the earth naturally in this town, before opening and losing its
seeds, and almost every pitch-pine one that falls at all, is cut off by
a squirrel; and they begin to pluck them long before they are ripe, so
that when the crop of white-pine cones is a small one, as it commonly
is, they cut off thus almost everyone of these before it fairly
ripens.</p></li>
<li><p>I think, moreover, that their design, if I may so speak, in
cutting them off green, is partly to prevent their opening and losing
their seeds, for these are the ones for which they dig through the snow,
and the only white-pine cones which contain anything then. I have
counted in one heap the cores of two hundred and thirty-nine pitch-pine
cones which had been cut off and stripped by the red squirrel the
previous winter.</p></li>
<li><p>The nuts thus left on the surface, or buried just beneath it, are
placed in the most favorable circumstances for germinating [6] . I have
sometimes wondered how those which merely fell on the surface of the
earth got planted; but, by the end of December, I find the chestnut of
the same year partially mixed with the mold, as it were, under the
decaying and moldy leaves, where there is all the moisture and manure
they want, for the nuts fall fast. In a plentiful year a large
proportion of the nuts are thus covered loosely an inch deep, and are,
of course, somewhat concealed from squirrels.</p></li>
<li><p>One winter, when the crop had been abundant, I got, with the aid
of a rake, many quarts of these nuts as late as the tenth of January;
and though some bought at the store the same day were more than half of
them moldy, I did not find a single moldy one among those which I picked
from under the wet and moldy leaves, where they had been snowed on once
or twice. Nature knew how to pack them best. They were still plump and
tender. Apparently they do not heat there, though wet. In the spring
they are all sprouting.</p></li>
<li><p>Occasionally, when threading the woods in the fall, you will hear
a sound as if some one had broken a twig, and, looking up, see a jay
pecking at an acorn, or you will see a flock of them at once about it,
in the top of an oak, and hear them break it off. They then fly to a
suitable limb, and placing the acorn under one foot, hammer away at it
busily, making a sound like a woodpecker’s tapping, looking round from
time to time to see if any foe is approaching, and soon reach the meat,
and nibble at it, holding up their heads to swallow while they hold the
remainder very firmly with their claws. Nevertheless, it often drops to
the ground before the bird has done with it.</p></li>
<li><p>I can confirm what William Barton wrote to Wilson, the
ornithologist [7] , that “The jay is one of the most useful agents in
the economy [8] of nature for disseminating [9] forest trees and other
nuciferous [10] and hard-seeded vegetables on which they feed. In
performing this necessary duty they drop abundance of seed in their
flight over fields, hedges, and by fences, where they alight to deposit
them in the post holes, etc. It is remarkable what numbers of young
trees rise up in fields and pastures after a wet winter and spring.
These birds alone are capable in a few years’ time to replant all the
cleared lands.”</p></li>
<li><p>I have noticed that squirrels also frequently drop nuts in open
land, which will still further account for the oaks and walnuts which
spring up in pastures; for, depend on it, every new tree comes from a
seed. When I examine the little oaks, one or two years old, in such
places, I invariably find the empty acorn from which they
sprung.</p></li>

<p>亨利·戴维·梭罗（1817—1862），这个性情古怪的作家和自然学家出生于美国马萨诸塞州康科德。
1837年，他毕业于哈佛大学。梭罗是一名优秀的英语文学和古典文学学者，对东方文学也极为熟悉。他的父亲是一个铅笔制造商，他曾一度子承父业，但后来主要以教学、演讲、土地测量和木匠手艺为生。
1845年，梭罗在康科德附近的瓦尔登湖边上为自己建造了一座小木屋，并在这里居住了两年。他与霍桑、爱默生等其他文化名流交往甚密，其主要作品有《瓦尔登湖，或在林中的生活》、《康科德和梅里马克河上的一周》、《远足》、《缅因森林》、《科德角》、《一个美国人在加拿大》以及《给不同人写的信》。梭罗不擅描述，即便如此，亦足以在世界文坛鹤立鸡群。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>所有的松树种子上都长着一层薄膜，外观酷似昆虫的翅膀，独立的薄膜裹住并庇护种子生长，使种子得以在根基部孕育。换句话说，松树种子四周像是编织着一个美丽的薄袋，袋子上带着小小把手，这样风便能擎着它，将种子运送到其他地方，为植物繁衍后代扩展疆域。与专利局寄邮包的方式相比，这种用风来运送种子的方法同样有效。</p></li>
<li><p>因此，有些人认为松树是无中生有地长出来的，这种想法根本毫无依据。我相信，松树是由种子孕育而成的，这样的结论并不是出于个人臆测，当然，大自然繁衍植物的方式向来鲜人关注。北美的大部分树种都来自欧洲，然后逐渐在这里繁衍生息。</p></li>
<li><p>当你砍伐一片橡树林，被砍伐的土地上不会马上就生长出松树；除非现在或不久以前，附近曾有一片带籽的松树林，而且两块林地之间相隔不远，能让风将种子吹落到这片土地。不过，就松林周边而言，如果你能阻止其他作物在这块土地上生长，那么，只要土壤适宜，你势必将会拥有一片扩展的松树林。</p></li>
<li><p>当我走在一片山核桃林间，即使在八月，我也会不时听到山雀在头顶上啄落山核桃的声音，果子还绿莹莹的。秋天，在小镇四周的橡树林里或树林附近，我总能看到地面上有许多三四英寸长的粗壮橡树枝，枝上挂着半打空的橡果壳。松鼠们啃噬着坚果两侧硬枝，以便搬运简单方便。要是你击打或摇晃栗树，松鸡和红松鼠总会对你的行为报以尖叫，它们，抑或我们，光顾森林的目的没什么不同，所谓同行总是冤家，一点不假。</p></li>
<li><p>当我穿过树林的时候，我经常看到红松鼠或灰松鼠从树上扔下带着芒刺的绿色栗子。我总觉得，松鼠们想必是冲我砸来的。事实上，在栗子成熟的季节，松鼠们是如此忙碌，你只需在树林中稍站片刻，便能清晰地听到栗子的落地声。</p></li>
<li><p>一个猎人告诉我，就在前一天——当时是十月中旬，他看到有一枚带着芒刺的绿色栗子掉落在我们的大河甸上，离最近的树林有五十杆远，离最近的栗树就更远了，他实在想不出它是怎么跑到那儿去的。隆冬季节，当我捡拾栗子的时候，偶尔会发现三四十粒的栗子聚拢成堆，被常见的林鼠留在落叶覆盖下的地洞里。</p></li>
<li><p>冬天，这项传播并种植坚果的活动，在雪中往往更显而易见。几乎在每片树林里，你都会看到红松鼠或灰松鼠在雪地里四处刨挖着，有时能挖到两英尺深，然而总能挖到一枚橡果或松果。它们挖得那么得心应手，就好像它们是直接从底下埋藏的坚果往上挖似的。——你我是无法做到这点的。即使在降雪前，我们要找到埋在地下的坚果也极为不易。毫无疑问，这些坚果是松鼠们在秋天埋下的。你也许会好奇，它们究竟是记住了埋藏地点，还是循着嗅觉找到的。</p></li>
<li><p>到了冬天，红松鼠通常会藏在常青灌木丛的地下，经常是落叶林间的一小丛常青灌木。如果树林外仍有结着坚果的树木，它们外出的通道一般会径直通向那里。因此，我们无须认为，森林里应该到处长有橡树，只要离红松鼠的躲藏地二十或三十杆范围内有那么几株，播种也就绰绰有余了。</p></li>
<li><p>我不妨大胆设想一下，在这小镇上每一颗自然掉落到地面上的，还没完全打开果壳失去松籽的白松松果，以及几乎每一颗落下的油松果，都是被松鼠啃下来的。远在松果成熟之前，松鼠就开始采撷松果。因此，当白松松果长得还很小的时候，松鼠们通常就已经把每颗还没成熟的松果啃落了。</p></li>
<li><p>除此之外，我认为松鼠之所以要把青涩的白松松果啃落，一部分原因就是为了防止它们成熟开壳，失去里面的松籽。这些松果就是松鼠冬天在雪中所挖出的松果，也只有这些松果里面还留有松籽。去年冬天，我曾数过一堆被红松鼠啃落并剥皮的油松果果芯，共有二百三十九颗。</p></li>
<li><p>坚果被丢弃地面或浅埋地下，给种子提供了极易发芽的环境。然而，我有时会疑惑，那些仅仅掉落在地面上的种子是如何发芽的。但到了十二月末，我发现当年的橡果里混进了一部分霉菌，就好像它们被埋在腐烂发霉的落叶下面一样。坚果落下的速度很快，而霉菌为它们提供了所需的水分和肥料。在丰收的年份，大量坚果就这样被落叶松散地埋了一英寸厚，这样多少蒙过了松鼠的眼睛。</p></li>
<li><p>有一年冬天，坚果产量丰富，虽然已经是一月十日，我仍然用一副钉耙挖出了许多坚果。尽管当天我在商店里买到的坚果有半数以上都发霉了，但是这些从潮湿霉烂的落叶下挖出的坚果，却丝毫没有霉斑。这些落叶曾被大雪掩埋了一两次，大自然知道如何最好地储存这些坚果，它们仍然丰满新鲜。很显然，它们虽然潮湿，却缺乏发霉所需要的温度。到了春天，这些坚果便都争先恐后地发芽了。</p></li>
<li><p>有时，在秋天的树林间漫步的时候，你会听到某个声音，像是有人在折断树枝。抬头望去，你会看到一只松鸡在橡树顶上啄食橡果，或是一群松鸡在树梢上上下翻飞啄食，那是橡果破裂的声音。倏尔，它们会飞到一株合适的树干上，将橡果踩在一只爪子下面，急急地捶啄它，发出啄木鸟式的敲啄声，时而左顾右盼，留意是否有敌人悄悄逼近。很快，松鸡便啄到橡果果肉，先是小口啄食，继而仰头吞咽，爪子还紧紧抓着残剩果肉。但是，尚有些橡果鸟喙未动，就已经掉落地上。</p></li>
<li><p>依我看来，威廉·巴顿写给鸟类学家威尔逊的信中这段话颇有道理：“在大自然经济活动中，松鸡是最有效的中介之一。它以坚果为食，同时将结有坚果或硬籽的森林种子到处传播。为了完成这项必要的任务，它们在飞越田野和灌木丛的时候，一路上落下大量种子；它们在篱笆上停留，把种子储存在篱笆坑洞里，诸如此类。历经湿润的冬春两季，大量的树苗在田野和草地上蓬勃生长起来。短短几年时间，光凭这群小鸟就能将所有垦荒地再度植被造林。”</p></li>
<li><p>我还注意到，松鼠也经常把坚果掉落在开阔的空地上，这种现象可以进一步解释，橡树和胡桃树为何在牧场上萌芽而出，每一株树苗的萌发皆来自种子。当我查看这些树龄仅一两年的小橡树时，总能在树木发芽的地方找到种子空壳，无一例外。</p></li>

<p>Celia Thaxter (b.1836, d.1894), whose maiden name was Laighton, was
born in Portsmouth, N.H. Much of her early life was passed on White
Island, one of a group of small islands, called the Isles of Shoals,
about ten miles from the shore, where she lived in the lighthouse
cottage. In 1867-68, she published, in the “Atlantic Monthly,” a number
of papers on these islands, which were afterwards bound in a separate
volume. Mrs. Thaxter was a contributor to several periodicals, and in
strength and beauty of style has few equals among American writers. The

<p>宗教——社会的唯一基石</p>
<p>William Ellery Channing (b. 1780, d. 1842), an eminent divine and
orator, was born at Newport, R.I. He graduated from Harvard with the
highest honors in 1798, and, in 1803, he was made pastor of the Federal
Street Church, Boston, with which he maintained his connection until his
death. Towards the close of his life, being much enfeebled, he withdrew
almost entirely from his pastoral duties, and devoted himself to
literature. Dr. Channing’s writings are published in six volumes, and
are mainly devoted to theology.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Religion is a social concern; for it operates powerfully on
society, contributing in various ways to its stability and prosperity.
Religion is not merely a private affair; the community [1] is deeply
interested in its diffusion [2] ; for it is the best support of the
virtues and principles, on which the social order rests. Pure and
undefiled religion is to do good; and it follows, very plainly, that if
God be the Author and Friend of society, then, the recognition of him
must enforce all social duty, and enlightened [3] piety must give its
whole strength to public order.</p></li>
<li><p>Few men suspect, perhaps no man comprehends, the extent of the
support given by religion to every virtue. No man, perhaps, is aware how
much our moral and social sentiments are fed from this fountain; how
powerless conscience would become without the belief of a God; how
palsied would be human benevolence, were there not the sense of a higher
benevolence to quicken and sustain it; how suddenly the whole social
fabric [4] would quake, and with what a fearful crash it would sink into
hopeless ruin, were the ideas of a Supreme Being, of accountableness and
of a future life to be utterly erased [5] from every mind.</p></li>
<li><p>And, let men thoroughly believe that they are the work and sport
of chance; that no superior intelligence concerns itself with human
affairs; that all their improvements perish forever at death; that the
weak have no guardian, and the injured no avenger; that there is no
recompense for sacrifices to uprightness and the public good; that an
oath is unheard in heaven; that secret crimes have no witness but the
perpetrator [6] ; that human existence has no purpose, and human virtue
no unfailing friend; that this brief life is everything to us, and death
is total, everlasting extinction [7] ; once let them thoroughly abandon
religion, and who can conceive or describe the extent of the desolation
which would follow?</p></li>
<li><p>We hope, perhaps, that human laws and natural sympathy would hold
society together. As reasonably might we believe that were the sun
quenched in the heavens, our torches would illuminate, and our fires
quicken and fertilize [8] the creation. What is there in human nature to
awaken respect and tenderness, if man is the unprotected insect of a
day? And what is he more, if atheism [9] be true?</p></li>
<li><p>Erase all thought and fear of God from a community, and
selfishness and sensuality [10] would absorb the whole man. Appetite,
knowing no restraint, and suffering, having no solace or hope, would
trample in scorn on the restraints of human laws. Virtue, duty,
principle, would be mocked and spurned as unmeaning sounds. A sordid
self-interest would supplant every feeling; and man would become, in
fact, what the theory in atheism declares him to be,—a companion for
brutes.</p></li>

<li><p>宗教是一种社会关注，因为它强有力地作用于社会，以各种方式对社会的稳定和繁荣做出贡献。宗教并不仅仅是个体信仰，它的传播与社会利益攸关，因为宗教理念为人们提供了美德与道德原则，而良好的社会运行则依赖于此。最本原的宗教教义旨在行善，因此，显而易见：如果上帝缔造了社会，是人类朋友，那么，承认上帝的存在必然会强化所有的社会职能，而信徒们的虔诚也会加强社会秩序。</p></li>
<li><p>鲜有人质疑，或许无人意识到，就维系并推动人类每一善行来说，宗教究竟能走多远。也许，人们可能无从获悉，人类道德与社会感知究竟从宗教精神源头汲取多少营养？如果不再信奉上帝，人类良知将是多么的苍白无力；如果没有更高的仁慈来依赖与信靠，人类的善行将多么的难以维系；社会构建系统无一避免将随即产生动荡，在恐惧中坍塌为绝望的废墟：即至高无上的存在，责任担当意识以及对未来生活的祈求向往将从每一个心灵完全抹去。</p></li>
<li><p>如果没有宗教，人们就只能相信：他们的存在只是因为偶然，没有先哲神明关注人类生活；他们死后，一切成就都将化为灰烬；弱者无人保护，伤者无法讨还公道，为正义与公众利益奉献牺牲的人无法获取补偿；冥冥中，不再听到铿锵誓言；作恶多端者无人为其犯罪指证，人类的存在毫无目的，人类的美德也没有始终如一的支持；这条简短的生命就是我们的全部，而死亡会将一切永远抹煞。——一旦人类彻底放弃宗教，谁能想象或描述接踵而来的心灵荒芜与绝望？</p></li>
<li><p>我们寄望，或许，人类法律和本性悲悯可以促进社会凝聚抱团。不妨合乎情理地设想一下，如果天上的太阳最终熄灭，人类火炬能否持久发光？人类光明能否孕育世间万物生长？如果人类沦为不受保护的一介虫豸，那么，究竟什么可以唤醒人类本性或心底蛰伏的生命尊重与脉脉温情？如果无神论确实可信，那么，人类与虫豸又有什么区别？</p></li>
<li><p>如果从一个社会中彻底消除对上帝的信仰与敬畏，那么，自私与纵欲将完全吞噬整个人类。无休止的贪婪欲望，毫无安慰和希望的痛苦，势必轻蔑地践踏着人类法律的底线。良好美德、责任担当以及普世原则将变得毫无意义，任由嘲弄蔑视并随意唾弃。人类的美好情感，将被肮脏卑劣地追逐私人利益所取代。事实上，正像无神论者所公开宣扬的那样——人类无疑将沦为与禽兽为伍。</p></li>

<p>伊丽莎白·埃克斯·艾伦（1832—1911）出生于美国缅因州斯特朗，在风景如画的家乡度过她的孩提时代。伊丽莎白年幼时，母亲便去世了，但她继承了母亲的优雅举止和缜密思想。母亲逝世不久，她的父亲举家迁往缅因州的法明顿，一个文人倍出的小镇。伊丽莎白早期作品以“珀西·佛罗伦萨”为笔名发表。十二岁时，她便发表了一些诗歌。
1856年，她出版了第一部诗集，题为《缅因州树林里的嫩芽》。伊丽莎白曾做过一段时间《波特兰文字录》的助理编辑。下面节选的这首诗，曾有五人声称为他们所作，其实，皆为沽名钓誉之徒的妄言。</p>

MAN AND THE INFERIOR ANIMALS·人类与低等动物</h2>
<h2 id="lesson-95-1">LESSON 95</h2>
<p>MAN AND THE INFERIOR ANIMALS</p>
<p>人类与低等动物</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The chief difference between man and the other animals consists
in this, that the former has reason, whereas the latter have only
instinct; but, in order to understand what we mean by the terms reason
and instinct, it will be necessary to mention three things in which the
difference very distinctly appears.</p></li>
<li><p>Let us first, to bring the parties as nearly on a level as
possible, consider man in a savage state, wholly occupied, like the
beasts of the field, in providing for the wants of his animal nature;
and here the first distinction [1] that appears between them is the use
of implements [2] . When the savage provides himself with a hut or a
wigwam [3] for shelter, or that he may store up his provisions, he does
no more than is done by the rabbit, the beaver, the bee, and birds of
every species.</p></li>
<li><p>But the man can not make any progress in this work without tools;
he must provide himself with an ax even before he can cut down a tree
for its timber; whereas these animals form their burrows [4] , their
cells, or their nests, with no other tools than those with which nature
has provided them. In cultivating the ground, also, man can do nothing
without a spade or a plow; nor can he reap what he has sown till he has
shaped an implement with which to cut clown his harvest. But the
inferior animals provide for themselves and their young without any of
these things.</p></li>
<li><p>Now for the second distinction. Man, in all his operations, makes
mistakes; animals make none. Did you ever hear of such a thing as a bird
sitting on a twig lamenting over her half-finished nest and puzzling her
little head to know how to complete it? Or did you ever see the cells of
a beehive in clumsy, irregular shapes, or observe anything like a
discussion [5] in the little community, as if there were a difference of
opinion among the architects?</p></li>
<li><p>The lower animals are even better physicians than we are; for
when they are ill, they will, many of them, seek out some particular
herb, which they do not, use as food, and which possesses a medicinal
[6] quality exactly suited to the complaint; whereas, the whole college
of physicians will dispute for a century about the virtues of a single
drug.</p></li>
<li><p>Man undertakes nothing in which he is not more or less puzzled;
and must try numberless experiments before he can bring his undertakings
to anything like perfection; even the simplest operations of domestic
life are not well performed without some experience; and the term of
man’s life is half wasted before he has done with his mistakes and
begins to profit by his lessons.</p></li>
<li><p>The third distinction is that animals make no improvements; while
the knowledge, and skill, and the success of man are perpetually on the
increase. Animals, in all their operations, follow the first impulse of
nature or that instinct which God has implanted in them. In all they do
undertake, therefore, their works are more perfect and regular than
those of man.</p></li>
<li><p>But man, having been endowed [7] with the faculty [8] of thinking
or reasoning about what he does, is enabled by patience and industry to
correct the mistakes into which he at first falls, and to go on
constantly improving. A bird’s nest is, indeed, a perfect structure; yet
the nest of a swallow of the nineteenth century is not at all more
commodious or elegant than those that were built amid the rafters of
Noah’s ark. But if we compare the wigwam of the savage with the temples
and palaces of ancient Greece and Rome, we then shall see to what man’s
mistakes, rectified [9] and improved upon, conduct him.</p></li>
<li><p>“When the vast sun shall veil his golden light</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Deep in the gloom of everlasting night;</p>
<p>When wild, destructive flames shall wrap the skies,</p>
<p>When ruin triumphs, and when nature dies;</p>
<p>Man shall alone the wreck of worlds survive;</p>
<p>’Mid falling spheres, immortal man shall live.”</p>
<p>(Jane Taylor)</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>人类与其他动物的主要区别在于：前者具有理性，而后者唯有本能。但是，为了更好地理解我们所说的“理性”与“本能”，我们有必要阐述这个区别的三点明显表现。</p></li>
<li><p>首先，让我们先把人类与动物尽可能放在同一个水平上做比较：设想一个处于原始状态的人，像山野里的野兽一样，只剩下兽性，为满足自己的生存欲望而努力。这里，我们便可看出人类与动物之间的第一个差异：对工具的使用。当原始人为自己盖一间茅房或棚屋来遮风挡雨，或是贮藏食物，其实，人类行为绝非具有超越野兔、海狸、蜜蜂或任何鸟类的本能意义。</p></li>
<li><p>如果没有工具，在原始生存环境下，人类不会获取任何进步。当原始人为获取木头而砍伐树木前，他就必须准备刀斧之类的工具；而动物们为自己挖掘巢穴、筑造蜂房、搭建鸟窝，它们除了依靠大自然赋予它们的自身能力以外，并没有其他工具。同样，如果没有锄头或耕犁，人类无法耕作或翻整土地，甚而无法收获播种的庄稼，除非他事先做出某种可以收割庄稼的工具。然而，低等动物却无法为它们自己或后代制造任何这类工具。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，我们来谈谈第二个差异。就人类行为举止而言，凡夫俗子错误在所难免，而动物却不会犯错。你可曾听说过一只鸟儿蹲在树枝上，对着它尚未完工的鸟巢感慨哀叹，用它的小脑袋绞尽脑汁地思考着该如何完成？亦或是，你可曾看见一群蜜蜂，围着它们拙劣的、不规则的蜂巢抱怨，或是看见它们彼此议论纷纷，就好像这些小建筑师之间正在交换意见？</p></li>
<li><p>与我们人类相比，低等动物不愧是更好的医生。当它们生病时，大部分动物都会在外面找到某种特殊的药草，并不是为了食用，而是专门用它来治疗相应的病症。反之，如果是人类，哪怕一种药物，整个医学界会对它的疗效喋喋不休地讨论上百年。</p></li>
<li><p>人类做事总喜欢瞻前顾后，他必须无数次躬身亲为，才能将他的事情做到近乎完美。哪怕是像家庭生活这种简单的事情，也需要经验与阅历，才能游刃有余。当一个人结束自己的跌跌撞撞，开始从自身经验教训里终有所得时，他的人生时光早已挥霍过半。</p></li>
<li><p>人类与动物的第三个区别在于，动物本身不存在任何改进或进步，而人类的知识、技能以及成功却永远在增长。动物的所有行为，都只是在遵循生物的最初欲望或上帝赋予它们的本能冲动，因此，它们所做出的成果，总是比人类做出的更为完美有序。</p></li>
<li><p>但是，人类被赋予了思考和推理的能力，因此，不管他做什么，他都能用耐心和勤奋来不停地纠正最初错误，并且不断加以改善。诚然，一个鸟巢是一件完美的艺术品；但是，一只十九世纪的燕子建的鸟巢，并不比一只诺亚方舟里的燕子在椽木上所建的鸟巢更宽敞、更舒适。相反，如果我们把原始人所盖的棚屋与古希腊或古罗马时代的庙宇宫殿相比较，我们可以看到，通过纠正并改善自己的错误，人类在这样的过程中走向完美。</p></li>
<li><p>“当巨大太阳收敛起金色光芒，</p></li>
</ol>
<p>世界沉溺在永恒夜晚的黑暗中，</p>
<p>当狂野的毁灭火焰呼啸着吞噬天空，</p>
<p>世界开始坍塌，自然走向濒亡，</p>
<p>人类在世界的废墟中，孤独伫立，</p>
<p>星辰坠落消逝，而人类必将永生。”</p>

<p>John Godfrey Saxe (b. 1816, d.1887), an American humorist, lawyer,
and journalist, was born at Highgate, Vt. He graduated at Middlebury
College in 1839; was admitted to the bar in 1843; and practiced law
until 1850, when he became editor of the “Burlington Sentinel.” In 1851,
he was elected State’s attorney. “Progress, a Satire, and Other Poems,”
his first volume, was published in 1849, and several other volumes of
great merit attest his originality. For genial humor and good-natured
satire, Saxe’s writings rank among the best of their kind, and are very
popular.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It was six men of Indostan,</li>
</ol>
<p>To learning much inclined,</p>
<p>Who went to see the elephant,</p>
<p>(Though all of them were blind,)</p>
<p>That each by observation</p>
<p>Might satisfy his mind.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The first approached the elephant,</li>
</ol>
<p>And, happening to fall</p>
<p>Against his broad and sturdy side,</p>
<p>At once began to bawl:</p>
<p>“God bless me! but the elephant</p>
<p>Is very like a wall!”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The second, feeling of the tusk,</li>
</ol>
<p>Cried: “Ha! what have we here,</p>
<p>So very round, and smooth, and sharp?</p>
<p>To me ’t is very clear,</p>
<p>This wonder of an elephant</p>
<p>Is very like a spear!”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The third approached the animal,</li>
</ol>
<p>And, happening to take</p>
<p>The squirming trunk within his hands,</p>
<p>Thus boldly up he spake:</p>
<p>“I see,” quoth he, “the elephant</p>
<p>Is very like a snake!”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>The fourth reached out his eager hand,</li>
</ol>
<p>And fell about the knee:</p>
<p>“What most this wondrous beast is like,</p>
<p>Is very plain,” quoth he;</p>
<p>“ ’T is clear enough the elephant</p>
<p>Is very like a tree!”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>The fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,</li>
</ol>
<p>Said: “E’en the blindest man</p>
<p>Can tell what this resembles most:</p>
<p>Deny the fact who can,</p>
<p>This marvel of an elephant</p>
<p>Is very like a fan!”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>The sixth no sooner had begun</li>
</ol>
<p>About the beast to grope,</p>
<p>Than, seizing on the swinging tail</p>
<p>That fell within his scope,</p>
<p>“I see,” quoth he, “the elephant</p>
<p>Is very like a rope!”</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>And so these men of Indostan</li>
</ol>
<p>Disputed loud and long,</p>
<p>Each in his own opinion</p>
<p>Exceeding stiff and strong,</p>
<p>Though each was partly in the right,</p>
<p>And all were in the wrong!</p>

<p>Donald Grant Mitchell (b.1822, d. 1908). This popular American writer
was born in Norwich, Conn. He graduated at Yale in 1841. In 1844 he went
to England, and, after traveling through that country on foot, spent
some time on the continent. His first volume, “Fresh Gleanings, or a New
Sheaf from the Old Fields of Continental Europe, by Ik Marvel,” was
published in 1847, soon after his return home. He revisited Europe in
1848. On his return, he published “The Battle Summer.” Mr. Mitchell has
contributed to the “Knickerbocker Magazine,” the “Atlantic Monthly,” and
several agricultural journals. His most popular works are “The Reveries
of a Bachelor,” 1850, and “Dream Life,” 1851. Besides these, he has
written “My Farm of Edgewood,” “Wet Days at Edgewood,” “Doctor Johns,” a
novel, “Rural Studies,” and other works. He is a charming writer. In
1853 he was appointed United States consul at Venice. In 1855 he settled
on a farm near New Haven, Conn., where he now resides. The following
selection is from “Dream Life.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Little does the boy know, as the tide of years drifts by,
floating him out insensibly from the harbor of his home, upon the great
sea of life,—what joys, what opportunities, what affections, are
slipping from him into the shades of that inexorable [1] Past, where no
man can go, save on the wings of his dreams.</p></li>
<li><p>Little does he think, as he leans upon the lap of his mother,
with his eye turned to her, in some earnest pleading for a fancied
pleasure of the hour, or in some important story of his griefs, that
such sharing of his sorrows, and such sympathy with his wishes, he will
find nowhere again.</p></li>
<li><p>Little does he imagine that the fond sister Nelly, ever
thoughtful of his pleasures, ever smiling away his griefs, will soon be
beyond the reach of either; and that the waves of the years which come
rocking so gently under him will soon toss her far away, upon the great
swell of life.</p></li>
<li><p>But now, you are there. The fire light glimmers upon the walls of
your cherished home. The big chair of your father is drawn to its wonted
[2] corner by the chimney side; his head, just touched with gray, lies
back upon its oaken top. Opposite sits your mother: her figure is thin,
her look cheerful, yet subdued;—her arm perhaps resting on your
shoulder, as she talks to you in tones of tender admonition [3] , of the
days that are to come.</p></li>
<li><p>The cat is purring on the hearth; the clock that ticked so
plainly when Charlie died is ticking on the mantel still. The great
table in the middle of the room, with its books and work, waits only for
the lighting of the evening lamp, to see a return to its stores of
embroidery and of story.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon a little stand under the mirror, which catches now and then
a flicker of the fire light, and makes it play, as if in wanton, upon
the ceiling, lies that big book, reverenced of your New England
parents—the Family Bible. It is a ponderous [4] , square volume, with
heavy silver clasps, that you have often pressed open for a look at its
quaint [5] , old pictures, for a study of those prettily bordered pages,
which lie between the Testaments, and which hold the Family
Record.</p></li>
<li><p>There are the Births;—your father’s and your mother’s; it seems
as if they were born a long time ago; and even your own date of birth
appears an almost incredible [6] distance back. Then there are the
Marriages;—only one as yet; and your mother’s name looks oddly to you:
it is hard to think of her as anyone else than your doting [7]
parent.</p></li>
<li><p>Last of all come the Deaths;—only one. Poor Charlie! How it
looks!— “Died, 12 September, 18—, Charles Henry, aged four years.” You
know just how it looks. You have turned to it often; there you seem to
be joined to him, though only by the turning of a leaf.</p></li>
<li><p>And over your thoughts, as you look at that page of the Record,
there sometimes wanders a vague [8] , shadowy fear, which will
come,—that your own name may soon be there. You try to drop the notion,
as if it were not fairly your own; you affect to slight it, as you would
slight a boy who presumed [9] on your acquaintance, but whom you have no
desire to know.</p></li>
<li><p>Yet your mother—how strange it is!—has no fears of such dark
fancies. Even now, as you stand beside her, and as the twilight deepens
in the room, her low, silvery voice is stealing upon your ear, telling
you that she can not be long with you;—that the time is coming, when you
must be guided by your own judgment, and struggle with the world unaided
by the friends of your boyhood.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a little pride, and a great deal more of anxiety, in
your thoughts now, as you look steadfastly into the home blaze, while
those delicate fingers, so tender of your happiness, play with the locks
upon your brow. To struggle with the world,—that is a proud thing; to
struggle alone,—there lies the doubt! Then crowds in swift upon the calm
of boyhood the first anxious thought of youth.</p></li>
<li><p>The hands of the old clock upon the mantel that ticked off the
hours when Charlie sighed and when Charlie died, draw on toward
midnight. The shadows that the fireflame makes grow dimmer and dimmer.
And thus it is, that Home,—boy home, passes away forever,—like the
swaying of a pendulum,—like the fading of a shadow on the
floor.</p></li>

<li><p>男孩很少知道，岁月的潮水是如何在不知不觉间，让他漂流出家庭的港湾，驶入生活的浩瀚大海的。年少时的喜悦、机遇和情感就这样从他身旁悄然溜走，汇入那无法改变的“过去”。那个地方，哪怕插上他梦想的翅膀，也从没有人能抵达。</p></li>
<li><p>男孩从未想到，当男孩倚靠在母亲膝上，眼巴巴地望着她，急切地期盼着母亲为他带来一段美好的时光，或倾听他诉说一段悲伤的故事，这些对他的悲伤的分享，对他的梦想的鼓励，他再也无法在其他地方找到。</p></li>
<li><p>男孩很少想象的到，他最喜欢的小妹妹娜莉，曾为他的喜悦感到快乐，也曾用笑容化解了他的悲伤；然而很快，他们便渐离渐远。岁月的长河温柔地潮起潮落，她的身影很快便被颠簸到远方，被生活的巨大洪流所吞没。</p></li>
<li><p>但是现在，你在这里，火光在你心爱的家里壁炉中闪烁着。父亲的那把宽大椅子，仍然和往昔一样，靠在烟囱旁边的角落。他已鬓发斑白，把头轻轻靠在这把橡木的靠背椅上。母亲坐在对面，她身形消瘦，神色开心，笑容恬淡。她的手臂也许正抚着你的肩膀，温柔地对你轻声叮咛，嘱你不要荒废时日的家常道理。</p></li>
<li><p>猫咪在灶台上打着呼噜，壁炉架上立着的老钟，仍在不紧不慢地嘀嗒走着，一如既往，与查理死去时毫无两样。房间中央的那张大桌上摆摞着各种书籍和草稿，等待着夜晚降临的灯光。唯有置身于这熟悉的光影流泻里，才能恍然依稀回到昔日尘嚣。</p></li>
<li><p>那面穿衣镜立在一边，不时捕获着壁炉里闪烁的火光，逗弄着它，火光看起来像活的一样。镜子旁边的一张小凳上，放着那本大书，那是你来自新英格兰的父母最尊重的书籍——家庭《圣经》。这是一本厚重的方形大书，配着沉重的银扣，你经常将银扣摁开，为了看到里面古老泛黄的家庭照片，好奇地研究着那些镶着彩框的书页，它们夹在《旧约》与《新约》中间，记载着你的家谱。</p></li>
<li><p>这里面，有出生记录——你父亲的和你母亲的。他们的出生日期仿佛那么久远，而你的出生日期，似乎与它们之间相隔着一段几乎令人难以置信的距离。这里还有婚姻记录——不过只有一条。母亲的原名，你看着总觉得别扭：很难想象，在成为这个溺爱你的女人之前，她还曾经是另一个人。</p></li>
<li><p>最后，是死亡记录——只有一条。可怜的查理！即使是现在，这行字看起来仍那么刺眼！——“查尔斯·亨利，死于18××年9月12日，时年四岁。”你知道那行字长得什么样。你曾无数次地翻开这本书，看着它，似乎只要轻轻翻动一页书，你便能随早殇的查理而去。</p></li>
<li><p>当翻阅浏览这页家庭记录，你的思绪翻腾不安，模糊朦胧的恐惧偶尔会无端闯入：这一天终究会到来——你的名字，将会赫然出现在上面。你试图挥去这个荒谬的念头，仿佛它不是你的真实想法。你想忽视它，就好像忽视一个假装是你熟人的男孩，而你根本不想认识他。</p></li>
<li><p>然而你的母亲——多么奇怪啊！她对这些黑暗的想法竟没有任何恐惧。即使是现在，屋里的暮色渐渐加深，你站在她的身边，她那温柔悦耳的声音在你耳边低低响起，告诉你，她很快便要离你而去。离别的时刻就要到来，以后，你必须遵循自己内心的判断，独自一人在这个世界打拼，而你孩提时的同伴们将一个个离你远去。</p></li>
<li><p>听到这样的话，你有一点点骄傲，但更多的是焦虑。你紧紧盯着壁炉里晃动的火苗，母亲纤细的手指温柔抚过你额间蹙起的眉头，多么幸福的触感。在世打拼——这是件值得骄傲的事情；但是，要孤军奋斗——这样的想法多么令人忧虑！对青春时代的第一次担忧，就这样闯入你平静的少年时代。</p></li>
<li><p>查理在叹息，查理已死去，壁炉架上的古老壁钟仍在嘀嗒作响。已经快午夜了，壁炉中的火光愈发暗淡。这就是家，少年时代的家，已经永远逝去的家——就像那摇摆不停的钟摆，就像那地板上逐渐暗淡的阴影，都已经消逝不再。</p></li>

<p>Thomas Moore (b. 1779, d. 1852) was born in Dublin, Ireland, and he
was educated at Trinity College in that city. In 1799, he entered the
Middle Temple, London, as a student of law. Soon after the publication
of his first poetical productions, he was sent to Bermuda in an official
capacity. He subsequently visited the United States. Moore’s most famous
works are: “Lalla Rookh,” an Oriental romance, 1817; “The Loves of the
Angels,” 1823; and “Irish Melodies,” 1834; a “Life of Lord Byron,” and
“The Epicurean, an Eastern Tale.” “Moore’s excellencies,” says
Dr. Angus, “consist in the gracefulness of his thoughts, the wit and
fancy of his allusions and imagery, and the music and refinement of his
versification.”</p>

<p>A CHASE IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL</p>
<p>英吉利海峡追逐战</p>
<p>James Fenimore Cooper (b. 1789, d. 1851). This celebrated American
novelist was born in Burlington, N.J. His father removed to the state of
New York about 1790, and founded Cooperstown, on Otsego Lake. He studied
three years at Yale, and then entered the navy as a common sailor. He
became a midshipman in 1806, and was afterwards promoted to the rank of
lieutenant; but he left the service in 1811. His first novel,
“Precaution,” was published in 1819; his best work, “The Spy,” a tale of
the Revolutionary War, in 1821. The success of “The Spy” was almost
unprecedented, and its author at once took rank among the most popular
writers of the day. “The Pilot” and “The Red Rover” are considered his
best sea novels. “The Pioneers,” “The Last of the Mohicans,” “The
Prairie,” “The Pathfinder,” and “The Deerslayer” are among the best of
his tales of frontier life. The best of his novels have been translated
into nearly all of the European languages, and into some of those of
Asia. “The creations of his genius,” says Bryant, “shall survive through
centuries to come, and only perish with our language.” The following
selection is from”The Pilot.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The ship which the American frigate [1] had now to oppose, was a
vessel of near her own size and equipage [2] ; and when Griffith looked
at her again, he perceived that she had made her preparations to assert
her equality in manful fight.</p></li>
<li><p>Her sails had been gradually reduced to the usual quantity, and,
by certain movements on her decks, the lieutenant and his constant
attendant, the Pilot [3] , well understood that she only wanted to
lessen the distance a few hundred yards to begin the action.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Now spread everything,” whispered the stranger.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Griffith applied the trumpet to his mouth, and shouted, in a
voice that was carried even to his enemy, “Let fall—out with your
booms—sheet home—hoist away of everything!”</p></li>
<li><p>The inspiring cry was answered by a universal bustle. Fifty men
flew out on the dizzy heights of the different spars, while broad sheets
of canvas rose as suddenly along the masts, as if some mighty bird were
spreading its wings. The Englishman instantly perceived his mistake, and
he answered the artifice [4] by a roar of artillery. Griffith watched
the effects of the broadside [5] with an absorbing interest as the shot
whistled above his head; but when he perceived his masts untouched, and
the few unimportant ropes, only, that were cut, he replied to the uproar
with a burst of pleasure.</p></li>
<li><p>A few men were, however, seen clinging with wild frenzy to the
cordage, dropping from rope to rope, like wounded birds fluttering
through a tree, until they fell heavily into the ocean, the sullen ship
sweeping by them in a cold indifference. At the next instant, the spars
and masts of their enemy exhibited a display of men similar to their
own, when Griffith again placed the trumpet to his mouth, and shouted
aloud, “Give it to them; drive them from their yards, boys; scatter them
with your grape; unreeve their rigging!”</p></li>
<li><p>The crew of the American wanted but little encouragement to enter
on this experiment with hearty good will, and the close of his cheering
words was uttered amid the deafening roar of his own cannon. The Pilot
had, however, mistaken the skill and readiness of their foe; for,
notwithstanding the disadvantageous circumstances under which the
Englishman increased his sail, the duty was steadily and dexterously
performed.</p></li>
<li><p>The two ships were now running rapidly on parallel lines, hurling
at each other their instruments of destruction with furious industry,
and with severe and certain loss to both, though with no manifest [6]
advantage in favor of either. Both Griffith and the Pilot witnessed,
with deep concern, this unexpected defeat of their hopes; for they could
not conceal from themselves that each moment lessened their velocity
through the water, as the shot of the enemy stripped the canvas from the
yards, or dashed aside the lighter spars in their terrible
progress.</p></li>
<li><p>“We find our equal here,” said Griffith to the stranger. “The
ninety is heaving up again like a mountain; and if we continue to
shorten sail at this rate, she will soon be down upon us!”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“You say true, sir,” returned the Pilot, musing, “the man shows
judgment as well as spirit; but—”</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>He was interrupted by Merry, who rushed from the forward part of the
vessel, his whole face betokening the eagerness of his spirit and the
importance of his intelligence.—</li>
</ol>
<p>“The breakers!” he cried, when nigh enough to be heard amid the din;
“we are running dead on a ripple, and the sea is white not two hundred
yards ahead.”</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>The Pilot jumped on a gun, and, bending to catch a glimpse through
the smoke, he shouted, in those clear, piercing tones, that could be
even heard among the roaring of the cannon,—</li>
</ol>
<p>“Port, port your helm! we are on the Devil’s Grip! Pass up the
trumpet, sir; port your helm, fellow; give it to them, boys—give it to
the proud English dogs!”</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>Griffith unhesitatingly relinquished the symbol of his rank,
fastening his own firm look on the calm but quick eye of the Pilot, and
gathering assurance [7] from the high confidence he read in the
countenance of the stranger. The seamen were too busy with their cannon
and the rigging to regard the new danger; and the frigate entered one of
the dangerous passes of the shoals, in the heat of a severely contested
battle.</p></li>
<li><p>The wondering looks of a few of the older sailors glanced at the
sheets of foam that flew by them, in doubt whether the wild gambols of
the waves were occasioned by the shot of the enemy, when suddenly the
noise of cannon was succeeded by the sullen wash of the disturbed
element, and presently the vessel glided out of her smoky shroud, and
was boldly steering in the center of the narrow passages.</p></li>
<li><p>For ten breathless minutes longer the Pilot continued to hold an
uninterrupted sway [8] , during which the vessel ran swiftly by ripples
and breakers, by streaks of foam and darker passages of deep water, when
he threw down his trumpet and exclaimed—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“What threatened to be our destruction has proved our salvation.—Keep
yonder hill crowned with wood one point open from the church tower at
its base, and steer east and by north; you will run through these shoals
on that course in an hour, and by so doing you will gain five leagues of
your enemy, who will have to double their trail.”</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p>Every officer in the ship, after the breathless suspense of
uncertainty had passed, rushed to those places where a view might be
taken of their enemies. The ninety was still steering boldly onward, and
had already approached the two-and-thirty, which lay a helpless wreck,
rolling on the unruly seas that were rudely tossing her on their wanton
billows. The frigate last engaged was running along the edge of the
ripple, with her torn sails flying loosely in the air, her ragged spars
tottering in the breeze, and everything above her hull exhibiting the
confusion of a sudden and unlooked-for check to her progress.</p></li>
<li><p>The exulting taunts and mirthful congratulations of the seamen,
as they gazed at the English ships, were, however, soon forgotten in the
attention that was required to their own vessel. The drums beat the
retreat, the guns were lashed, the wounded again removed, and every
individual able to keep the deck was required to lend his assistance in
repairing the damages to the frigate, and securing her masts.</p></li>
<li><p>The promised hour carried the ship safely through all the
dangers, which were much lessened by daylight; and by the time the sun
had begun to fall over the land, Griffith, who had not quitted the deck
during the day, beheld his vessel once more cleared of the confusion of
the chase and battle, and ready to meet another foe.</p></li>

<p>詹姆斯·弗尼莫尔·库柏（1789—1851），这位著名的美国小说家出生于新泽西州伯灵顿。大约在1790年，他的父亲举家迁往纽约州，并在奥齐戈湖畔建立了库柏镇。他在耶鲁大学学习了三年，然后以一名普通海员的身份进入海军服役。
1806年，库柏成为海军候补少尉，后来被晋升至海军中尉，并于1811年退役。库柏的首部小说《警戒》发表于1819年，他最好的作品《间谍》，一篇描述美国独立战争的小说，发表于1821年。《间谍》获得了前所未有的成功，并使库柏一举跻身为当时最负声望的作家之一。《领航员》和《红色流浪者》被认为是他最好的海洋题材小说。《开拓者》、《最后的莫希干人》、《大草原》、《探路者》和《猎鹿人》则为他边陲题材的优秀小说。库柏的几本成名作几乎被翻译成所有的欧洲语言，并被引进亚洲的一些国家。“他天才的作品，”布莱恩特如此评价，“将在未来的数个世纪中流存。只有当我们的语言消亡了，他的作品才无法流传。”下面这篇文章节选自《领航员》。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>这艘美国护卫舰此刻所面临的对手，是一艘规模和装备都与它旗鼓相当的英国舰船。格里菲斯再次审视了一下自己的舰艇，认为它已经做好充分的准备，完全可以投入即将到来的激烈战斗中去。</p></li>
<li><p>护卫舰的船速已经逐渐减慢到通常的速度，水手们在甲板上忙碌着。格里菲斯中尉和总是站在他身边的领航员都很清楚，只要再靠近敌船几百码，就可以发动攻击。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“现在，展开全部风帆。”那位新来的领航员低声说道。</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>格里菲斯将小号放到嘴边，大声喊道：“放下船帆——张开帆杆——扣紧帆索——放下所有船帆！”他的声音洪亮得几乎连敌人都能听见。</p></li>
<li><p>水手们齐心协力地迅速行动起来，回应这个鼓舞人心的命令。五十名水手从不同横梁的高处飞了出去，宽大的船帆一瞬间便沿着桅杆升起，仿佛一只庞大的巨鸟突然张开翅翼。英国佬立刻意识到自己的失策，开始用一连串炮击来回应这个诡计。格里菲斯深感兴趣地观察着舷侧的炮轰效果，有些炮弹甚至呼啸着飞过他的头顶。但是，当他看到船上的桅杆毫发无损，只有一些无关紧要的绳索被炸断的时候，他对敌人的轰击报以一阵开怀大笑。</p></li>
<li><p>然而，有几名水手被紧紧缠绕在帆绳上，从一根绳索掉到另一根绳索，好像透过层层树枝从树上跌下的受伤小鸟，直到重重地摔入大海，冷漠的舰船无动于衷地从他们旁边驶过。紧接着，敌舰甲板的桅杆上亦有士兵陆续掉进海里，重现美舰甲板上的场景。格里菲斯再次将小号靠近嘴边，高声喊道：“狠狠教训他们一顿！把他们从帆桁上打下来，弟兄们，用炮弹把他们轰散！轰断他们的绳索！”</p></li>
<li><p>这些美国船员们只需要一点鼓励，便会斗志昂扬地参与进来。格里菲斯那些鼓舞人心的话音未落，就已经被淹没在舰船发出的震耳欲聋的炮火声中。然而，领航员错误地估计了敌人的技能和准备的充分程度。尽管环境对他们很不利，英国舰队仍然有条不紊地、熟练地加快了航行速度。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，这两艘船正快速地齐头并进着，互相发动猛烈的炮轰，短兵相接，炸弹纷飞，交火双方损失惨重，但尚未有哪一方明显占据上风。带着急切的期待，这场未曾料想的海上激战使格里菲斯中尉和领航员原以为胜券在握的希望落了空。他们已经无法再欺骗自己，随着敌人猛烈的炮击，护卫舰的船帆从帆桁上一条条撕裂，较轻的横梁也在高速的航行中断裂开来，舰船的速度每分钟都在减慢。</p></li>
<li><p>“我们碰到难缠的对手了。”格里菲斯对身边新来的领航员说，“那艘九十门舰像座大山一样向我们高高压来，如果我们像现在这样继续放慢速度，它很快就会压上我们！”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“确实如此，先生，”领航员一边回答，一边沉思着，“对方不但展示出充分的判断力，也表现出相应的毅力。但是——”</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>他的话被麦瑞打断了，后者从船只前端冲过来，满脸焦急万分，像有重大事情要报——“碎浪！”他高喊着，炮火声几乎掩盖了他的声音，“我们遇到碎浪区了，前方两百码的整个海面都是白色的。”</p></li>
<li><p>领航员跳上一门大炮，弯腰从烟雾间向外张望。他用尖锐而清晰的声音高喊着，这声音甚至盖过了炮火的轰鸣声：“掌舵！掌好舵！我们驶入恶魔之钳了！中尉，把小号递给我。掌好舵，弟兄们，狠狠揍他们一顿——狠狠把这群自鸣得意的英国狗暴揍一顿！”</p></li>
<li><p>格里菲斯毫不犹豫地将这个象征着他权威地位的小号递给领航员，他坚毅的视线对上后者冷静而急促的眼神，并从后者的神情中读出了令他放心的坚定不移的自信。水手们在炮台和帆索上忙碌着，应付着这眼前的危险水域。在疯狂的炮火中，护卫舰驶入了这片浅海最危险的水路之一。</p></li>
<li><p>一些年长的水手们看着身边这片满是白色泡沫的海面，脸上带着惊异的表情，想知道这些碰击涌撞的白色碎浪是否由敌人的炮弹所引起。突然，炮火声被浪花冷冷撞击船舷的声音所掩盖，舰船滑出炮火烟雾的笼罩，大胆地行驶在狭窄的水路中心。</p></li>
<li><p>接下来的十多分钟里，每个人都紧张得屏住呼吸。领航员仍然镇定地指挥着全局，舰船快速地从波纹与碎浪之间、从一条条竖长的泡沫与暗色的深水区之间通过。终于，他扔下小号，高喊道——</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“这片曾威胁过我们的水域就是我们的救星——把罗盘指向远方那座山顶有树林的山和山脚下的教堂塔楼之间，朝着东方偏北的方向行驶，你们会在一小时内驶离这片浅滩。这样看来，我舰会比敌舰快五海里，他们路程肯定会增倍。”</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p>听完这段话，船上的每个士兵都难以置信地停顿了一会儿，然后纷纷冲到可以看到敌船的地方。敌方舰队中的三十二门舰已经撞上礁石，随着浪花毫不客气地肆意撞击，无助地随波逐流着。那艘九十门舰仍然勇猛地继续前进，已经非常靠近那艘三十二门舰。最后，美国护卫舰终于驶出碎浪区，撕裂的船帆松散地在空中飘舞着，破烂的横梁在风中摇摇欲坠，船身上到处显示出一场突如其来、无法预料的战事如此惨烈不堪。</p></li>
<li><p>当船员们看到英国舰队的遭遇时，他们欢呼雀跃起来，大笑着击掌相庆，但很快就被命令回到自己岗位上去。撤退的鼓声敲响了，枪声鸣放起来，伤员被抬走了，每个还有能力守在甲板上的士兵都被要求帮忙修补护卫舰，并固定好桅杆。</p></li>
<li><p>接下来的一小时，正如领航员所承诺的那样，舰船安全地驶过所有危险区域。阳光下，这片水域的危险程度被降低了。太阳渐渐西沉，一整天都没有离开过甲板的格里菲斯中尉再次环顾四周，确认他的舰船已经远离不久前的追逐与战斗，并且做好准备迎接下一个敌人。</p></li>

<p>BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE [1]</p>
<p>约翰·摩尔爵士的葬礼</p>
<p>Charles Wolfe (b. 1791, d. 1823), an Irish poet and clergyman, was
born in Dublin. He was educated in several schools, and graduated at the
university of his native city. He was ordained in 1817, and soon became
noted for his zeal and energy as a clergyman. His literary productions
were collected and published in 1825. “The Burial of Sir John Moore,”
one of the finest poems of its kind in the English language, was written
in 1817, and first appeared in the “Newry Telegraph,” a newspaper, with
the author’s initials, but without his knowledge. Byron said of this
ballad that he would rather be the author of it than of any one ever
written.</p>

<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,</li>

<p>And smoothed down his lonely pillow,</p>
<p>That the foe and the stranger would tread o’er his head,</p>

<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Lightly they’ll talk of the spirit that’s gone</li>

<p>And o’er his cold ashes upbraid [3] him;</p>
<p>But little he’ll reck [4] , if they’ll let him sleep on</p>
<p>In a grave where a Briton has laid him.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>But half of our heavy task was done,</li>

<p>When the clock struck the hour for retiring</p>
<p>And we heard the distant random [5] gun</p>

<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Slowly and sadly we laid him down,</li>

<p>From the field of his fame, fresh and gory;</p>

<p>查尔斯·沃尔夫（1791—1823），爱尔兰诗人和牧师，出生于都柏林。他曾在几所学校接受教育，并最终毕业于都柏林当地的大学。
1817年，沃尔夫被任命为牧师，并很快因他的激情与感染力而享有声望。他的文学作品于1825年被结集出版。《约翰·摩尔先生的葬礼》写于1817年，堪称用英文写就的同类诗歌题材中的上乘之作。这首诗首次刊登在《纽里电讯》报上，报纸只刊登了作者姓名的首字母缩写，却未有关于作者的只言片语介绍。拜伦曾说，与他所有曾写过的诗歌相比，他更希望自己是这首诗的作者。</p>

<p>微小的胜利</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“O Mother, now that I have lost my limb, I can never be a soldier
or a sailor; I can never go round the world!” And Hugh burst into tears,
now more really afflicted [1] than he had ever been yet. His mother sat
on the bed beside him, and wiped away his tears as they flowed, while he
told her, as well as his sobs would let him, how long and how much he
had reckoned [2] on going round the world, and how little he cared for
anything else in future; and now this was the very thing he should never
be able to do!</p></li>
<li><p>He had practiced climbing ever since he could remember, and now
this was of no use; he had practiced marching, and now he should never
march again. When he had finished his complaint, there was a pause, and
his mother said,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Hugh, you have heard of Huber?”</p>
<p>“The man who found out so lunch about bees?” said Hugh.</p>
<p>“Bees and ants. When Huber had discovered more than had ever been
known about these, and when he was sure that he could learn still more,
and was more and more anxious to peep into their tiny homes and curious
ways, he became blind.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Hugh sighed, and his mother went on.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Did you ever hear of Beethoven? He was one of the greatest musical
composers [3] that ever lived. His great, his sole delight was in music.
It was the passion of his life. When all his time and all his mind were
given to music, he suddenly became deaf, perfectly deaf; so that he
never more heard one single note from the loudest orchestra [4] . While
crowds were moved and delighted with his compositions, it was all
silence to him.” Hugh said nothing.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>“Now do you think,” asked his mother—and Hugh saw that a mild and
gentle smile beamed from her countenance—“do you think that these people
were without a Heavenly Parent?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“O no! but were they patient?” asked Hugh.</p>
<p>“Yes, in their different ways and degrees. Would you suppose that
they were hardly treated? Or would you not rather suppose that their
Father gave them something better to do than they had planned for
themselves?”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>“He must know best, of course; but it does seem very hard that that
very thing should happen to them. Huber would not have so much minded
being deaf, perhaps; or that musical man, being blind.</li>
</ol>
<p>“No doubt their hearts often swelled within them at their
disappointments; but I fully believe that they very soon found God’s
will to be wiser than their wishes. They found, if they bore their trial
well, that there was work for their hearts to do far nobler than any the
head could do through the eye or the ear. And they soon felt a new and
delicious pleasure which none but the bitterly disappointed can
feel.”</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>“The pleasure of rousing the soul to bear pain, and of agreeing with
God silently, when nobody knows what is in the breast. There is no
pleasure like that of exercising one’s soul in bearing pain, and of
finding one’s heart glow with the hope that one is pleasing God.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“Shall I feel that pleasure?”</p>
<p>“Often and often, I have no doubt; every time you can willingly give
up your wish to be a soldier or a sailor, or anything else you have set
your mind upon, you will feel that pleasure. But I do not expect it of
you yet. I dare say it was long a bitter thing to Beethoven to see
hundreds of people in raptures with his music, when he could not hear a
note of it.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>“But did he ever smile again?” asked Hugh.</li>
</ol>
<p>“If he did, he was happier than all the fine music in the world could
have made him,” replied his mother.</p>
<p>“I wonder, oh, I wonder, if I shall ever feel so!”</p>
<p>“We will pray to God that you may. Shall we ask him now?” Hugh
clasped his hands. His mother kneeled beside the bed, and, in a very few
words, prayed that Hugh might be able to bear his misfortune well, and
that his friends might give him such help and comfort as God should
approve [5] .</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Hugh found himself subject to very painful feelings sometimes, such
as no one quite understood, and such as he feared no one was able to
pity as they deserved. On one occasion, when he had been quite merry for
a while, and his mother and his sister Agnes were chatting, they thought
they heard a sob from the sofa. They spoke to Hugh, and found that he
was indeed crying bitterly.</li>
</ol>
<p>“What is it, my dear?” said his mother. “Agnes, have we said anything
that could hurt his feelings?”</p>
<p>“No, no,” sobbed Hugh. “I will tell you, presently.”</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>And, presently, he told them that he was so busy listening to
what they said that he forgot everything else, when he felt as if
something had gotten between two of his toes; unconsciously he put down
his hand as if his foot were there! Nothing could be plainer than the
feeling in his toes; and then, when he put out his hand, and found
nothing, it was so terrible, it startled him so! It was a comfort to
find that his mother knew about this. She came, and kneeled by his sofa,
and told him that many persons who had lost a limb considered this the
most painful thing they had to bear for some time; but that, though the
feeling would return occasionally through life, it would cease to be
painful.</p></li>
<li><p>Hugh was very much dejected [6] , and when he thought of the
months and years to the end of his life, and that he should never run
and play, and never be like other people, he almost wished that he were
dead.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Agnes thought that he must be miserable indeed if he could venture to
say this to his mother. She glanced at her mother’s face, but there was
no displeasure there. On the contrary, she said this feeling was very
natural. She had felt it herself under smaller misfortunes than Hugh’s;
but she had found, though the prospect appeared all strewn with
troubles, that they came singly, and were not so hard to bear, after
all.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>She told Hugh that when she was a little girl she was very lazy,
fond of her bed, and not at all fond of dressing or washing.</li>
</ol>
<p>“’Why, mother! you?” exclaimed Hugh.</p>
<p>“Yes; that was the sort of little girl I was. Well, I was in despair,
one day, at the thought that I should have to wash, and clean my teeth,
and brush my hair, and put on every article of dress, every morning, as
long as I lived.”</p>
<p>“Did you tell anybody?” asked Hugh.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>“No, I was ashamed to do that; but I remember I cried. You see how
it turns out. When we have become accustomed to anything, we do it
without ever thinking of the trouble, and, as the old fable tells us,
the clock that has to tick so many millions of times, has exactly the
same number of seconds to do it in. So will you find that you can move
about on each separate occasion, as you wish, and practice will enable
you to do it without any trouble or thought.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“But this is not all, nor half what I mean,” said Hugh.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>“No, my dear, nor half what you will have to bear. You resolved to
bear it all patiently, I remember. But what is it you dread the
most?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“Oh! all manner of things. I can never do like other people.”</p>
<p>“Some things,” replied his mother. “You can never play cricket, as
every</p>
<p>Crofton boy would like to do. You can never dance at your sister’s
Christmas parties.”</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>“O mamma!” cried Agnes, with tears in her eyes, and with the thought
in her mind that it was cruel to talk so.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Go on! Go on!” cried Hugh, brightening. “You know what I feel,
mother; and you don’t keep telling me, as others do, and even sister
Agnes, sometimes, that it will not signify much, and that I shall not
care, and all that; making out that it is no misfortune, hardly, when I
know what it is, and they don’t. Now, then, go on, mother! What
else?”</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>“There will be little checks and mortifications continually, when
you see little boys leaping over this, and climbing that, and playing at
the other, while you must stand out, and can only look on. And some
people will pity you in a way you will not like: and some may even laugh
at you.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“O mamma!” exclaimed Agnes.</p>
<p>“Well, and what else?” said Hugh.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>“Sooner or later you will have to follow some way of life determined
by this accident instead of one that you would have liked better.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“Well, what else?”</p>
<p>“I must ask you, now. I can think of nothing more; and I hope there
is not much else; for, indeed, I think here is quite enough for a boy,
or anyone else, to bear.”</p>
<p>“I will bear it though; you will see.”</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>“You will find great helps. These misfortunes of themselves
strengthen one’s mind. They have some advantages too. You will be a
better scholar for your lameness, I have no doubt. You will read more
books, and have a mind richer in thoughts. You will be more beloved by
us all, and you yourself will love God more for having given you
something to bear for his sake. God himself will help you to bear your
trials. You will conquer your troubles one by one, and by a succession
of LITTLE VICTORIES will at last completely triumph over all.”</li>

<li><p>“哦，妈妈，我现在已经失去了一条腿，我再也不能成为一名士兵或水手，再也不能环游世界了！”休泪流满面，从未像今天这样饱受痛苦折磨。他的母亲坐在床边，一边轻轻拭去他的眼泪，一边听着他边哭边述说这么久以来，他有多想去环游世界；对于他的将来，除了环游世界以外，他几乎没想过其他事情，而现在，他再也无法做到了！</p></li>
<li><p>从记事起，他就开始练习攀爬，现在，这一点用处都没有了。他也曾练习正步走，如今，他也没法再走路了。当休慢慢停止哭诉后，屋里一阵沉默。然后，母亲说：</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“休，你听说过胡伯吗？”</p>
<p>“那个发现蜜蜂的许多奥秘的人？”休问道。</p>
<p>“蜜蜂，还有蚂蚁。当胡伯发现了许多以前从未有人知道的奥秘，当他确信自己能够了解得更多，并对蜜蜂和蚂蚁的微小巢穴和有趣的生活方式越来越感兴趣的时候，他瞎了。”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>休叹息了，他的母亲又说：</li>
</ol>
<p>“你听说过贝多芬吗？他是有史以来最伟大的音乐作曲家之一。他的伟大、他生命中唯一的乐趣就在于音乐，那是他生活的全部激情。但是当他将所有时光心血全部献给音乐的时候，他突然失去了听力，什么都听不到了，他再也没听过哪怕是最响亮的交响乐团里奏响的一个音符。当人们为他所创作的音乐深深感动、欢呼雀跃的时候，他的世界只有一片寂静。”休沉默了。</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>“现在，你觉得，”母亲说——休看到她脸上露出一丝温柔的微笑，“你觉得这些人不被天父所爱吗？”</li>
</ol>
<p>“哦，不！但他们都很耐心吗？”休问道。</p>
<p>“是的，以他们不同的方式和程度，他们都很耐心。你觉得，天父是对他们太残忍，还是为他们安排了一条他们自己无法想象的更好的道路？”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>“我们的天父早有安排，这是当然的。但是，他们都失去了对他们来说最重要的东西，这看起来还是太残忍了。胡伯也许不介意耳聋，而贝多芬也许不介意变瞎。</li>
</ol>
<p>“毫无疑问，他们的心里一定也曾装满了失望，但我完全相信，他们很快发现上帝的意志比他们的愿望更睿智。他们发现，当他们坦然承受厄运的试炼，他们用心能做到的事情，远比任何头脑仅仅通过眼睛或耳朵去做的事情更高贵。这样，无需多久，他们就会身心感受到一种全新的、美妙的幸福感，唯独那些最为痛苦失望的人才能悟出其中玄妙。”</p>
<p>“那是什么？”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>“那是一种当没有人知道心里能孕育出什么的时候，唤醒你的灵魂来承受痛苦、安静顺服上帝的幸福感。再没有一种快乐，能比在痛苦中淬炼你的灵魂并发现你的心为你能取悦上帝而欢欣更强烈了。”</li>
</ol>
<p>“我能感受到这种幸福吗？”</p>
<p>“你会经常不断地感受到，这一点，我毫不怀疑。每次当你自愿放弃成为士兵或水手的愿望，或任何其他你固执想做的事，你就能体会到这样的幸福感，但我并不指望这么快就看到你这样。我敢说，当贝多芬看到数百名听众正陶醉在他的音乐中，而他却一个音符都听不到的时候，他一定也曾痛苦了很久。”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>“但他后来重新感受到幸福了吗？”休问道。</li>
</ol>
<p>“如果他做到了，那一定比这世上所有最美妙的音乐所能带给他的幸福更强烈。”母亲回答道。</p>
<p>“我想知道，哦，我想知道，我是否能够感受到这样的幸福！”</p>
<p>“我们会向上帝祈祷，希望你能重新感受到。我们现在就祈祷，好吗？”休扣紧他的双手。母亲在他床边跪下，开始向上帝祈祷让休能够坦然承受他的不幸，保佑休的朋友们在上帝准许的范围内给予他帮助安慰。</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>休觉得有时自己极易为痛苦现实感伤，这点，任何其他人或许无法完全理解，他害怕身边没有人去怜悯那些值得同情的人。有一次，休的母亲和姐姐艾格尼丝在聊天，休显得非常开心，可不一会儿，她们突然听到沙发那儿传来的抽泣声。她们找到了休，发现他正哭得十分伤心。</li>
</ol>
<p>“亲爱的，你怎么了？”他的母亲说，“艾格尼丝，我们说过什么话伤害到休的感情了吗？”</p>
<p>“不，没有，”休抽泣着说，“我等会儿告诉你们。”</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>过了一会儿，他告诉她们，他正认真倾听她们的聊天，忘了身旁的其他事情。突然，他觉得好像有什么东西在他的脚趾之间，他下意识地把手伸下去触摸，就好像那条腿还在似的！脚趾间的感受那么清楚真切，但是，当他伸过手却什么都没摸到的时候，那种感觉太糟糕了，他一下子回到了现实！幸运的是，母亲谙知他的心事。她走过来，跪在他的沙发前，对儿子说：许多失去肢体的人都把这当成最痛苦、最难以承受的事情。尽管这种感觉偶尔还会回来，但慢慢的，这种感觉最终将会消失。</p></li>
<li><p>休心情黯然。一想到以后的几个月，几年，一直到他生命的终点，他都不能再奔跑玩耍，永远不能像其他人那样，他就痛苦地巴不得现在就死去。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>艾格尼丝想，休肯定是心里太难过绝望了，才对母亲说出心里话。她瞥了母亲一眼，母亲的脸上却没有丝毫的不快，相反，她说，这种感觉是很正常的。她曾经历过比这略小些的挫折，也曾产生过类似的感受。但她发现，虽然人生道路上总是挫折不断，但每一个单独到来的挫折，却并不是那么难以克服。</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>母亲告诉休，当她还是一个小女孩的时候，她实在很懒，喜欢赖床不起，讨厌穿衣洗漱。</li>
</ol>
<p>“什么，妈妈！你吗？”休惊呼起来。</p>
<p>“没错，我就是那样的孩子。是的，有一天，一想到每天早上我该去洗脸，该去刷牙，该去梳头，该去穿戴整齐，只要活着，就要千篇一律地该做这做那，我就觉得沮丧绝望。”</p>
<p>“你对别人说过这些吗？”休问道。</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>“没有，我那时羞于这么做，但我记得，我哭了。结果你看，现在我对这些事都习惯了。当我们已经习惯了某件事，我们就会自然而然地去做它，丝毫不会为它忧心自扰。有句俗话说得好，时钟虽然要嘀嗒工作数万亿次，但它其实也只不过每秒钟走一格罢了。你会发现，你也只需认真对待好每个场合，慢慢的，这样的练习就能让你以后轻松地克服困难，甚至都不会意识到它。”</li>
</ol>
<p>“但这根本就不是我的意思，半点都不沾边。”休说道。</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>“你说的对，亲爱的，我说的这些远远不及你所要经历的痛苦。我记得，你原本下定决心耐心承受这件事，但现在你承受不住了，你最害怕的是什么？”</li>
</ol>
<p>“所有事情！我再也不能像其他人一样了。”</p>
<p>“并非所有事情，”他母亲回答道，“你永远不能像其他克罗夫顿镇上的男孩一样打板球了，你也永远不能在你姐姐的圣诞聚会中跳舞了。”</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>“哦，妈妈！”艾格尼丝叫起来，泪水在她的眼眶里打转，心想这样的谈话对弟弟来说实在是太残忍了。</li>
</ol>
<p>“接着说！接着说呀！”休叫着，眼里闪着焦灼的光，“妈妈，你知道我的感受。您不像别人，包括姐姐艾格尼丝那样，反复告诉我这没什么，让我不要放在心上之类。他们总想让我知道，少了一条腿并不是什么不幸，可我知道它是，他们不理解！请接着说下去，妈妈，还有什么是我不能做的？”</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>“当其他男孩们蹦蹦跳跳，上攀下爬，与伙伴们一同玩耍，而你却不得不站在一边看着他们的时候，你的内心总会感到些许压抑，或者某种屈辱。有些人会怜悯你，也许是用你不喜欢的方式，更有人会索性嘲笑你。”</li>
</ol>
<p>“哦，妈妈，快别说了！”艾格尼丝喊着。</p>
<p>“嗯，还有什么？”休说。</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>“或早或迟，你总得遵守一些这起事故为你决定的生活方式，而不是你更喜欢的生活方式。”</li>
</ol>
<p>“嗯，还有吗？”</p>
<p>“现在，我必须问你，我想不起来还有其他什么是你不能做的，我但愿没有更多的需要提醒。毕竟，对于一个男孩或对于任何人来说，你要承受的这些已经足够多了。”</p>
<p>“我会承受下去的，妈妈，您看着吧。”</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>“你会得到慷慨的帮助。这些不幸，能强化一个人的心灵，它们有着自身的价值。你的残疾将令你成为一个更杰出的学者，对此，我毫不怀疑。你会博览群书，头脑睿智敏锐，思想深邃丰富。你将赢得我们大家更多的爱戴，而你自己也将更敬靠上帝，因他出于他的旨意，给了你这些需要承受的苦难，上帝将一路帮助你接受你的试炼。你将逐个克服自己的困难，并通过这一连串微小的胜利，最终完全战胜人生的所有困难。”</li>

<p>THE CHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE</p>
<p>幸福生活的特点</p>
<p>Sir Henry Wotton (b. 1568, d. 1639) was born at Bocton Hall, Kent,
England. He was educated at Winchester and Oxford. About 1598 he was
taken into the service of the Earl of Essex, as one of his secretaries.
On the Earl’s committal to the Tower for treason, Wotton fled to France;
but he returned to England immediately after the death of Elizabeth, and
received the honor of knighthood. He was King James’s favorite
diplomatist, and, in 1623, was appointed provost of Eton College. Wotton
wrote a number of prose works; but his literary reputation rests mainly
on some short poems, which are distinguished by a dignity of thought and
expression rarely excelled.</p>

ART OF DISCOURAGEMENT·泼冷水的艺术</h2>
<h2 id="lesson-103-1">LESSON 103</h2>
<p>THE ART OF DISCOURAGEMENT</p>
<p>泼冷水的艺术</p>
<p>Arthur Helps (b. 1813, d. 1875) graduated at Cambridge, England, in
1835. His best known works are: “Friends in Council, a Series of
Readings and Discourses,” “Companions of my Solitude,” and “Realmah,” a
tale of the “lake dwellers” in southern Europe. He has also written a
“History of the Spanish Conquests in America,” two historical dramas,
and several other works. Mr. Helps was a true thinker, and his writings
are deservedly popular with thoughtful readers. In 1859 he was appointed
secretary of the privy council.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Regarding, one day, in company with a humorous friend, a noble
vessel of a somewhat novel construction sailing slowly out of port, he
observed, “What a quantity of cold water somebody must have had down his
back.” In my innocence, I supposed that he alluded to the wet work of
the artisans who had been building the vessel; but when I came to know
him better, I found that this was the form of comment he always indulged
in when contemplating any new and great work, and that his “somebody”
was the designer of the vessel.</p></li>
<li><p>My friend had carefully studied the art of discouragement, and
there was a class of men whom he designated [1] simply as “cold-water
pourers.” It was most amusing to hear him describe the lengthened
sufferings of the man who first designed a wheel; of him who first built
a boat; of the adventurous personage who first proposed the daring
enterprise of using buttons, instead of fish bones, to fasten the scanty
raiment of some savage tribe.</p></li>
<li><p>Warming with his theme, he would become quite eloquent in
describing the long career of discouragement which these rash men had
brought upon themselves, and which he said, to his knowledge, must have
shortened their lives. He invented imaginary dialogues between the
unfortunate inventor, say of the wheel, and his particular friend, some
eminent cold-water pourer. For, as he said, every man has some such
friend, who fascinates him by fear, and to whom he confides his
enterprises in order to hear the worst that can be said of
them.</p></li>
<li><p>The sayings of the chilling friend, probably, as he observed, ran
thus:—“We seem to have gone on very well for thousands of years without
this rolling thing. Your father carried burdens on his back. The king is
content to be borne on men’s shoulders. The high priest is not too proud
to do the same. Indeed, I question whether it is not irreligious to
attempt to shift from men’s shoulders their natural burdens.</p></li>
<li><p>“Then, as to its succeeding,—for my part, I see no chance of
that. How can it go up hill? How often you have failed before in other
fanciful things of the same nature! Besides, you are losing your time;
and the yams [2] about your hut are only half planted. You will be a
beggar; and it is my duty, as a friend, to tell you so plainly.</p></li>
<li><p>“There was Nang-chung: what became of him? We had found fire for
ages, in a proper way, taking a proper time about it, by rubbing two
sticks together. He must needs strike out fire at once, with iron and
flint; and did he die in his bed? Our sacred lords saw the impiety of
that proceeding, and very justly impaled [3] the man who imitated
heavenly powers. And, even if you could succeed with this new and absurd
rolling thing, the state would be ruined. What would become of those who
carry burdens on their backs? Put aside the vain fancies of a childish
mind, and finish the planting of your yams.”</p></li>
<li><p>It is really very curious to observe how, even in modern times,
the arts of discouragement prevail. There are men whose sole pretense to
wisdom consists in administering discouragement. They are never at a
loss. They are equally ready to prophesy, with wonderful ingenuity, all
possible varieties of misfortune to any enterprise that may be proposed;
and when the thing is produced, and has met with some success, to find a
flaw in it.</p></li>
<li><p>I once saw a work of art produced in the presence of an eminent
cold-water pourer. He did not deny that it was beautiful; but he
instantly fastened upon a small crack in it that nobody had observed;
and upon that crack he would dilate [4] whenever the work was discussed
in his presence. Indeed, he did not see the work, but only the crack in
it. That flaw,—that little flaw,—was all in all to him.</p></li>
<li><p>The cold-water pourers are not all of one form of mind. Some are
led to indulge in this recreation from genuine timidity. They really do
fear that all new attempts will fail. Others are simply envious and
ill-natured. Then, again, there is a sense of power and wisdom in
prophesying evil. Moreover, it is the safest thing to prophesy, for
hardly anything at first succeeds exactly in the way that it was
intended to succeed.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, there is the lack of imagination which gives rise [5] to
the utterance of so much discouragement. For an ordinary man, it must
have been a great mental strain to grasp the ideas of the first
projectors [6] of steam and gas, electric telegraphs, and pain-deadening
chloroform. The inventor is always, in the eyes of his fellow-men,
somewhat of a madman; and often they do their best to make him
so.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, there is the want of sympathy; and that is, perhaps, the
ruling cause in most men’s minds who have given themselves up to
discourage. They are not tender enough, or sympathetic enough, to
appreciate all the pain they are giving, when, in a dull plodding way,
they lay out argument after argument to show that the project which the
poor inventor has set his heart upon, and upon which, perhaps, he has
staked his fortune, will not succeed.</p></li>
<li><p>But what inventors suffer, is only a small part of what mankind
in general endure from thoughtless and unkind discouragement. Those
high-souled men belong to the suffering class, and must suffer; but it
is in daily life that the wear and tear of discouragement tells so much.
Propose a small party of pleasure to an apt discourager, and see what he
will make of it. It soon becomes sicklied over with doubt and
despondency; and, at last, the only hope of the proposer is, that his
proposal, when realized, will not be an ignominious failure. All hope of
pleasure, at least for the proposer, has long been out of the
question.</p></li>

<p>亚瑟·海普斯（1813—1875）于1835年毕业于英国剑桥大学。他最著名的作品有《枢密院之友：系列读物与论述》、《我的孤独伴侣》及《真诚的人》，后者是一个关于欧洲南部湖畔居者的故事。他还写了一部《西班牙美洲征服史》、两部历史剧及其他一些作品。海普斯是一名真正的思想家，他的作品在勤于思考的读者群中备受赞誉。
1859年，他被任命为枢密院书记。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>有一天，我与一位个性幽默的朋友走在一起，看到一艘造型颇为新奇的宏伟巨轮缓缓驶出港口，他感慨道：“为了建筑这艘船，某些人的背脊上一定被泼下不少冷水。”那时我还不太了解他，我想，他指的大概是建造这艘轮船的工匠们流下的辛勤汗水。但是，当更深入了解他以后，我才理解，见到某种创新而伟大的作品时，他总是发出类似的评论，而他所说的“某些人”指的是这艘轮船的设计者。</p></li>
<li><p>我这位朋友曾经仔细研究过打击别人的艺术，他将这群喜欢打击别人的人称为“泼冷水的人”。听他描述那些创新者们所承受的长久痛苦煎熬，总是很有趣的：那些最先设计出车轮的人，最先建造出船只的人，那些在野蛮部落里，最先大胆提出用纽扣而不是用鱼骨来扣紧他们身上未能蔽体的衣服的人。</p></li>
<li><p>一旦深入地聊起这个话题，朋友随即口若悬河，滔滔不绝地开始描述起这些冷漠的人是怎样进入这个泼冷水的长期职业的。而这份职业，他说，据他所知，一定缩短了他们的寿命。他假想了一段发生于一个不幸的设计师，譬如那位曾设计出车轮的人，与他身边的某个朋友，一位能干的泼冷水者之间的对话。我朋友说，每个人身边通常都会有这么个朋友，这个朋友用恐惧来萦绕发明者，而发明者也将他的全部构想与他的朋友分享，为的是听到所有最糟糕的情况。</p></li>
<li><p>据我朋友的观察，这位泼冷水的人向发明者说的话，很可能是这样：“几千年来，我们都没有这个会滚动的家伙，但不照样活得好好的！你父亲肩扛背驮，国王坐在轿夫肩上自得其乐，而牧师神父也并非过于自傲，不能手提肩负。说真的，你竟然想把人类应承担的重担从他们的肩膀上移开，这难道不是在亵渎宗教的教义吗？”</p></li>
<li><p>“至于它成功的可能性——我觉得，这东西根本不可能成功。它该怎么爬山？你在这些异想天开的东西上，已经失败过多少次了！你根本就是在浪费时间。有这闲工夫，你怎么不想想，你家旁边的地里番薯才种下一半。要是继续这么做，你一定会穷困潦倒，沦为乞丐。身为朋友，我有责任直截了当地提醒你这点。”</p></li>
<li><p>“历史上曾有过燧人氏：他后来怎样了？很久以来，我们都认真地花时间钻木取火，这是取得火种的最好办法。偏偏那个燧人氏，非要用铁和燧石一下子弄出火来！结果呢，他后来可曾安详地死在床上？我们神圣的上帝看到这种不敬神的、大逆不道的做法，于是公正地惩罚了那个试图模仿神的力量的人。要是你真的成功把这个新奇可笑的、滚动的东西造出来，我们这个国家一定会毁在你手上。那些用自己的肩膀承担起重担的人该怎么办？赶紧抛开这些徒劳的幼稚幻想，回家接着种你的番薯吧！”</p></li>
<li><p>即使是在当代，也仍然有很多人喜欢泼冷水，真是件令人惊奇的事。有些人，他们唯一可夸口的智慧就在于往别人身上泼冷水，他们总是振振有词。一旦有人提出任何创见，他们总是胸有成竹地做出预言，指出这个点子可能遇上的种种不幸遭遇；一旦有人将这个创意付诸实施，并获得一定的成功，他们又会百般挑剔，找到它的缺陷。</p></li>
<li><p>我曾经见过一件在一位著名的泼冷水者在场的情况下所诞生的艺术品。他并不否认这件艺术品的精美绝伦，但是他立刻紧紧抓住一个别人都没注意到的小裂纹大做文章。从那以后，只要有人在他面前讨论那件艺术品，他就一定会加油添醋地描述那条裂纹。说实在的，他从未真正看见那件艺术品，他眼里所见的，只有那条裂纹罢了。那道瑕疵——那道微小的瑕疵，对他来说就是一切。</p></li>
<li><p>这些泼冷水者心态也不一样。有些人之所以沉迷于以打击别人为乐，根源在于他们内心的恐惧，他们真心觉得所有的创新尝试都会失败。另一些人，只是出于单纯的嫉妒或恶意。另外，在预言失败的时候，预言者总能体会到一种权力感和智慧感。不管怎样，做出预言总是件最安全的事，毕竟，很少有什么事能从一开始就按它们被期待的那样获得成功。</p></li>
<li><p>除此之外，很多人喜欢打击别人，是因为他们缺乏想象力。对于一个普通人来说，要让他理解那些发明了蒸汽、瓦斯、电报以及作为麻醉剂的氯仿的发明家们的思维方式，未免太异想天开。在旁观者眼里，创新者多少都有点走火入魔，而泼冷水的人往往会不遗余力，使创新者看上去显得很疯狂。</p></li>
<li><p>最后，还有一个原因：缺乏同情心。这大概是绝大多数人纵容自己打击别人的最根本原因。他们不够宽容，不够悲悯，无法感受到他们给被打击者带来的痛苦。他们用一种乏味无趣的方式，列举种种理由，来证明这个可怜的发明者全身心投入的，甚至倾家荡产投资的这个项目，一定会失败。</p></li>
<li><p>但是，发明家们所承受的，只是整个人类从这种不顾及他人的、无情冷漠的泼冷水中所承受的痛苦的一小部分。那些灵魂高尚的人总是属于被打击的对象，也必须承受这样的责难。但是，那些日常生活中的打击抱怨带来的是更严重的后果。不妨向一个习惯打击别人的人提议举办一个小型欢乐聚会，观察他如何策划安排。这些快乐的事在他面前，很快就会被疑虑和泄气的话所取代。最后，你只能指望当你提出的建议被实现的时候，它们不会成为可耻的失败。只要在泼冷水者面前，提议者就不可能有任何快乐希望。</p></li>

<p>William Dimond (b. 1780, d. 1837) was a dramatist and poet, living at
Bath, England, where he was born and received his education. He
afterwards studied for the bar in London. His literary productions are
for the most part dramas, but he has also written a number of poems,
among them the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In slumbers of midnight the sailor boy lay;</li>
</ol>
<p>His hammock [1] swung loose at the sport of the wind;</p>
<p>But watch-worn and weary, his cares flew away,</p>
<p>And visions of happiness danced o’er his mind.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>He dreamed of his home, of his dear native bowers,</li>
</ol>
<p>And pleasures that waited on life’s merry morn;</p>
<p>While Memory each scene gayly covered with flowers,</p>
<p>And restored every rose, but secreted the thorn.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Then Fancy her magical pinions spread wide,</li>
</ol>
<p>And bade the young dreamer in ecstasy rise;</p>
<p>Now, far, far behind him the green waters glide,</p>
<p>And the cot of his forefathers blesses his eyes.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The jessamine clambers in flowers o’er the thatch,</li>
</ol>
<p>And the swallow chirps sweet from her nest in the wall;</p>
<p>All trembling with transport [2] , he raises the latch,</p>
<p>And the voices of loved ones reply to his call.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>A father bends o’er him with looks of delight;</li>
</ol>
<p>His cheek is impearled [3] with a mother’s warm tear;</p>
<p>And the lips of the boy in a love kiss unite</p>
<p>With the lips of the maid whom his bosom holds dear.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>The heart of the sleeper beats high in his breast;</li>
</ol>
<p>Joy quickens his pulses,—all his hardships seem o’er;</p>
<p>And a murmur of happiness steals through his rest,—</p>
<p>“O God! thou hast blest me,—I ask for no more.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Ah! whence is that flame which now bursts on his eye?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ah! what is that sound that now ’larums [4] his ear?</p>
<p>’T is the lightning’s red glare painting hell on the sky!</p>
<p>’T is the crashing of thunders, the groan of the sphere!</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>He springs from his hammock,—he flies to the deck;</li>
</ol>
<p>Amazement confronts him with images dire;</p>
<p>Wild winds and mad waves drive the vessel a wreck;</p>
<p>The masts fly in splinters; the shrouds are on fire.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Like mountains the billows tremendously swell;</li>
</ol>
<p>In vain the lost wretch calls on Mercy to save;</p>
<p>Unseen hands of spirits are ringing his knell,</p>
<p>And the death angel flaps his broad wings o’er the wave!</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>O sailor boy, woe to thy dream of delight!</li>
</ol>
<p>In darkness dissolves the gay frostwork of bliss!</p>
<p>Where now is the picture that Fancy touched bright,—</p>
<p>Thy parents’ fond pressure, and love’s honeyed kiss?</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>O sailor boy! sailor boy! never again</li>
</ol>
<p>Shall home, love, or kindred, thy wishes repay;</p>
<p>Unblessed and unhonored, down deep in the main,</p>
<p>Full many a fathom, thy frame shall decay.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>No tomb shall e’er plead to remembrance for thee,</li>
</ol>
<p>Or redeem form or fame from the merciless surge;</p>
<p>But the white foam of waves shall thy winding sheet be,</p>
<p>And winds in the midnight of winter thy dirge [5] .</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>On a bed of green sea flowers thy limbs shall be laid,—</li>
</ol>
<p>Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow;</p>
<p>Of thy fair yellow locks threads of amber be made,</p>
<p>And every part suit to thy mansion below.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>Days, months, years, and ages shall circle away,</li>
</ol>
<p>And still the vast waters above thee shall roll;</p>
<p>Earth loses thy pattern forever and aye;</p>
<p>O sailor boy! sailor boy! peace to thy soul!</p>

<p>THE PASSENGER PIGEON</p>
<p>过路的旅鸽</p>
<p>John James Audubon (b. 1780, d. 1851). This celebrated American
ornithologist was born in Louisiana. When quite young he was
passionately fond of birds, and took delight in studying their habits.
In 1797 his father, an admiral in the French navy, sent him to Paris to
be educated. On his return to America, he settled on a farm in eastern
Pennsylvania, but afterward removed to Henderson, Ky., where he resided
several years, supporting his family by trade, but devoting most of his
time to the pursuit of his favorite study. In 1826 he went to England,
and commenced the publication of the “Birds of America,” which consists
of ten volumes—five of engravings of birds, natural size, and five of
letterpress. Cuvier declares this work to be “the most magnificent
monument that art has ever erected to ornithology.” In 1830 Audubon
returned to America, and soon afterwards made excursions into nearly
every section of the United States and Canada. A popular edition of his
great work was published, in seven volumes, in 1844, and “The Quadrupeds
of America,” in six volumes,—three of plates and three of letterpress,
in 1846-50. He removed to the vicinity of New York about 1840, and
resided there until his death.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The multitudes of wild pigeons in our woods are astonishing.
Indeed, after having viewed them so often, and under so many
circumstances, I even now feel inclined to pause and assure myself that
what I am going to relate is a fact. Yet I have seen it all, and that,
too, in the company of persons who, like myself, were struck with
amazement.</p></li>
<li><p>In the autumn of 1813 I left my house at Henderson, on the banks
of the Ohio, on my way to Louisville. In passing over the Barrens, a few
miles beyond Hardinsburgh, I observed the pigeons flying, from northeast
to southwest, in greater numbers than I thought I had ever seen them
before, and feeling an inclination to count the flocks that might pass
within the reach of my eye in one hour, I dismounted, seated myself on
an eminence, and began to mark with my pencil, making a dot for every
flock that passed.</p></li>
<li><p>In a short time, finding the task which I had undertaken
impracticable, as the birds poured in in countless multitudes, I rose,
and, counting the dots then put down, found that one hundred and
sixty-three had been made in twenty-one minutes. I traveled on, and
still met more the farther I proceeded. The air was literally filled
with pigeons; the light of noonday was obscured as by an eclipse; and
the continued buzz of wings had a tendency to lull my senses to
repose.</p></li>
<li><p>Whilst waiting for dinner at Young’s inn, at the confluence of
Salt River with the Ohio, I saw, at my leisure, immense legions still
going by, with a front reaching far beyond the Ohio on the west, and the
beech wood forests directly on the east of me. Not a single bird
alighted, for not a nut or acorn was that year to be seen in the
neighborhood. They consequently flew so high that different trials to
reach them with a capital rifle proved ineffectual; nor did the reports
disturb them in the least.</p></li>
<li><p>I can not describe to you the extreme beauty of their aerial [1]
evolutions when a hawk chanced to press upon the rear of a flock. At
once, like a torrent, and with a noise like thunder, they rushed into a
compact mass, pressing upon each other towards the center. In these
almost solid masses, they darted forward in undulating and angular
lines, descended and swept close over the earth with inconceivable
velocity, mounted perpendicularly so as to resemble a vast column, and,
when high, were seen wheeling and twisting within their continued lines,
which then resembled the coils of a gigantic serpent.</p></li>
<li><p>As soon as the pigeons discover a sufficiency of food to entice
them to alight, they fly round in circles, reviewing the country below.
During their evolutions, on such occasions, the dense mass which they
form exhibits a beautiful appearance, as it changes its direction, now
displaying a glistening sheet of azure, when the backs of the birds come
simultaneously into view, and anon [2] suddenly presenting a mass of
rich, deep purple.</p></li>
<li><p>They then pass lower, over the woods, and for a moment are lost
among the foliage, but again emerge, and are seen gliding aloft. They
now alight; but the next moment, as if suddenly alarmed, they take to
wing, producing by the flappings of their wings a noise like the roar of
distant thunder, and sweep through the forests to see if danger is near.
Hunger, however, soon brings them to the ground.</p></li>
<li><p>When alighted, they are seen industriously throwing up the
withered leaves in quest of the fallen mast [3] . The rear ranks are
continually rising, passing over the main body, and alighting in front,
in such rapid succession, that the whole flock seems still on wing. The
quantity of ground thus swept is astonishing; and so completely has it
been cleared that the gleaner who might follow in their rear would find
his labor completely lost.</p></li>
<li><p>On such occasions, when the woods are filled with these pigeons,
they are killed in immense numbers, although no apparent diminution
ensues. About the middle of the day, after their repast is finished,
they settle on the trees to enjoy rest and digest their food. As the sun
begins to sink beneath the horizon; they depart en masse for the
roosting place, which not unfrequently is hundreds of miles distant, as
has been ascertained by persons who have kept an account of their
arrivals and departures.</p></li>
<li><p>Let us now inspect their place of nightly rendezvous [4] . One of
these curious roosting places, on the banks of the Green River, in
Kentucky, I repeatedly visited. It was, as is always the case, in a
portion of the forest where the trees were of great magnitude, and where
there was little underwood. I rode through it upwards of forty miles,
and, crossing it in different parts, found its average breadth to be
rather more than three miles. My first view of it was about a fortnight
subsequent [5] to the period when they had made choice of it, and I
arrived there nearly two hours before sunset.</p></li>
<li><p>Many trees, two feet in diameter, I observed, were broken off at
no great distance from the ground; and the branches of many of the
largest and tallest had given way, as if the forest had been swept by a
tornado. Everything proved to me that the number of birds resorting to
this part of the forest must be immense beyond conception.</p></li>
<li><p>As the period of their arrival approached, their foes anxiously
prepared to receive them. Some were furnished with iron pots containing
sulphur, others with torches of pine knots, many with poles, and the
rest with guns. The sun was lost to our view, yet not a pigeon had
arrived. Everything was ready, and all eyes were gazing on the clear
sky, which appeared in glimpses amidst the tall trees. Suddenly there
burst forth the general cry of, “Here they come!”</p></li>
<li><p>The noise which they made, though yet distant, reminded me of a
hard gale at sea passing through the rigging of a close-reefed vessel.
As the birds arrived and passed over me, I felt a current of air that
surprised me. Thousands were soon knocked down by the pole men. The
birds continued to pour in. The fires were lighted, and a magnificent as
well as wonderful and almost terrifying sight presented itself.</p></li>
<li><p>The pigeons, arriving by thousands, alighted everywhere, one
above another, until solid masses, as large as hogsheads, were formed on
the branches all round. Here and there the perches gave way under the
weight with a crash, and falling to the ground destroyed hundreds of the
birds beneath, forcing down the dense groups with which every stick was
loaded. It was a scene of uproar and confusion. I found it quite useless
to speak or even to shout to those persons who were nearest to me. Even
the reports of the guns were seldom heard, and I was made aware of the
firing only by seeing the shooters reloading.</p></li>
<li><p>The uproar continued the whole night; and as I was anxious to
know to what distance the sound reached, I sent off a man, accustomed to
perambulate [6] the forest, who, returning two hours afterwards,
informed me he had heard it distinctly when three miles distant from the
spot. Towards the approach of day, the noise in some measure subsided;
long before objects were distinguishable, the pigeons began to move off
in a direction quite different from that in which they had arrived the
evening before, and at sunrise all that were able to fly had
disappeared.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>NOTES.—The wild pigeon, in common with almost every variety of game,
is becoming more scarce throughout the country each year. The last
Passenger Pigeon died at the Cincinnati Zoo on September 1, 1914.
Population estimates ranged up to 5 billion, comprising 40% of the total
number of birds in North America in the 19th century.</p>

<p>约翰·詹姆斯·奥杜邦（1780—1851），这位著名的鸟类学家出生于美国路易斯安那州。年幼时，他便十分喜爱鸟类，以研究鸟类生活习性为乐。
1797年，他的父亲，法国海军的一名海军上将，将他送到巴黎接受教育。回到美国后，奥杜邦定居在宾夕法尼亚州东部的一个农场上，但后来移居到肯塔基州亨德森。他在那里居住数年，以经营贸易维持生计，但同时将大部分时间花在他最喜爱的鸟类研究上。
1826年，奥杜邦来到英国，着手进行《美国鸟类》一书的出版事宜。这套出版物共有十卷：其中五卷是对鸟类真实尺寸的凹刻印刷，另外五卷是凸版印刷，居维叶宣称这项作品是“鸟类学研究史上最为恢弘的艺术纪念碑”。
1830年，奥杜邦回到美国，不久便周游美国和加拿大，足迹几乎遍及美加所有地区。
1844年，他出版了一套七卷版的前述作品，这个版本广为流传。
1846年至1850年，他又出版了一套六卷版的《美洲的四足动物》——三卷是凹刻印刷，三卷是凸版印刷。
1840年左右，奥杜邦迁到纽约州附近定居，直到最后去世。</p>

<li><p>在我们这片树林中，野鸽的数量是相当惊人的。事实上，在如此众多的场合下这么频繁地见到它们以后，即使现在，我也忍不住要踌躇一下，以确保自己陈述皆为事实。是的，我的确看到了这一切。除我之外，当时身边还有许多人，也曾惊愕地目睹了这件事的发生。</p></li>
<li><p>1813年的秋天，我离开了位于俄亥俄河岸汉德森的家，出发前往路易斯维尔。经过哈丁斯堡数英里后，当穿过拜伦斯的时候，我看见天空中从东北往西南方向飞过的鸽群。有生以来我从未见到数量这么惊人的鸽群，因此，我心血来潮，想统计下一小时内从我视线里飞过的鸽群数目。我下了马，在高处找了个地方坐下，开始用铅笔做记号，每次飞过一个鸽群便标记一个小圆点。</p></li>
<li><p>很快我便发现，这个任务是不切实际的。无数的鸽群铺天盖地地飞过，根本难以数清。我站起身，数了数刚才标记下的小圆点，发现就在短短的二十一分钟里，至少有一百六十三个鸽群从我眼前呼啸而过。我继续向前方进发，越往前走便见到越多的鸽群，整个天空密密麻麻地飞满了鸽子。鸽群掠飞，宛若日食遮天蔽日，正午的阳光也完全被遮住了。鸽群振翼发出的翕动声，竟让我有种昏昏欲睡的冲动。</p></li>
<li><p>在当地青年旅馆就餐前的闲暇时间，站在盐河和俄亥俄州的交界处，我看到黑云压顶的庞大鸽群军团仍然连绵不绝地飞过。野鸽队伍前列早已长驱直入俄亥俄州西部，恰好抵达我所在位置东面的一片山毛榉森林。没有一只鸟儿停下来休息，因为，那一年的那片地区里，地上一颗坚果或橡实都看不到。这些鸽群飞得很高，有些人尝试了各种方法，甚至想用步枪将它们射下来，却徒劳无功，这些枪声甚至丝毫无法干扰它们。</p></li>
<li><p>当一只老鹰从鸽群后方逼近它们的时候，鸽群中产生的队列变化是那么奇异壮观，我几乎无法用言语向你描述。那一瞬间，像一道狂涌的洪流，带着雷鸣般的轰响，巨型队列迅速聚集，翅膀叠着翅膀向中心聚拢，用棱角分明的线条像波浪般起伏着飞翔。鸽群以迅雷不及掩耳之势，时而俯冲直下，时而横扫而过，时而又扶摇直上，犹如庞大柱体径直腾空而起。高空中，它们旋转着、飞旋着，汇成一条鸽群线条，像是一条盘绕着的粗壮巨蟒。</p></li>
<li><p>一旦鸽群发现地上有丰富的食物吸引它们下落，便会在天空中盘旋不停，俯视着底下的村庄。在这样的盘旋中，随着鸽团变换方向，当它们的鸟背同时朝着我的时候，便展示出一片闪耀着的蔚蓝色背脊，旋即又变换成一片浑厚深沉的紫色，精美绝伦。</p></li>
<li><p>接着，它们便低低地飞下，飞到树林上空。有那么一瞬间，鸽群消失在树叶间，但很快又再次出现，在空中高高地滑翔着。此刻，它们落到地面，但下一秒，仿佛受到什么惊吓似的，它们突然振翅高飞，双翼扑腾的声音就像远处传来的滚滚雷声。它们掠过森林，看危险是否临近，然而，饥饿很快便将它们再度吸引到地面上。</p></li>
<li><p>当它们落下时，我们可以看到它们辛勤翻找着地上的枯枝残叶，试图找到一些掉落的橡树果实。队伍后方的鸽子不断飞上天空，越过地上的鸽团，然后降落在整个队伍的前头。整个鸽团就这样迅速前进着，就好像它们仍在不断飞翔着。它们以惊人的速度横扫过地面，整个地面被清扫得一干二净，倘若这时有个拾穗人跟在鸽团后面，他会发现自己将一无所获。</p></li>
<li><p>当树林间落满了鸽群的时候，野鸽遭遇捕杀的数量相当惊人，尽管一眼看去，你根本察觉不出鸽群在数量上有所减少。正午时分，当鸽群填饱了肚子以后，它们便栖停在树上休息，消化着肚里的食物。太阳渐渐西沉，鸽群们成群结队地起飞，飞往禽鸟群栖的大树，那通常是在几百英里以外的地方——这点已经被一些记录着它们起飞与抵达过程的人们所确认。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，让我们观察一下它们夜间的集结地。其中一处有趣的群鸟栖息地位于肯塔基州的格林河岸边，我曾多次去查勘过这个地方。这里就像通常的群鸟栖息地一样，在森林的一角，四周林木葱郁，林下灌丛稀少。我骑马向北走了四十多英里，穿过这块栖息地，穿越它的不同部位，发现这块地方的平均宽度超过三英里。我第一次到达这块栖息地大约是鸽群在这里停留栖息的两周后，我在日落前两小时赶到了那里。</p></li>
<li><p>森林里巨树参天，我看到，许多直径两英尺的大树都在离地面很近的距离断开了，许多最高最粗壮的树枝也都断裂了，好似无情的龙卷风曾肆虐地掠过林中。这一切都向我表明，停留在这部分森林的鸟群数量惊人得超乎想象。</p></li>
<li><p>在等待鸽群飞回栖息地的期间，许多猎鸽人焦急地做好准备迎接它们。有些人往枪管里装上硫磺，有些人举着松节火把，许多人都拿着步枪，剩下的拿着手枪。太阳已经没入西边边陲，但丝毫没有鸽子的踪影。一切都已经准备好了，所有人的眼睛都注视着清澈的天空，虽然天空只能在高大的树梢间隐约可见。突然，人群中迸发出喊声，“它们来了！”</p></li>
<li><p>虽然鸽群离我们还有很长一段距离，但它们飞行时发出的喧囔声却让我想起大海上，狂风呼啸着穿过一艘收起风帆的船只时绳索装备所发出的声音。当鸽群飞翔着越过我的头顶，我感受到一阵强劲的气流。很快，上千只鸽子就被举着步枪的猎人击落，鸽群仍然陆续蜂拥飞来。火把被点燃了，眼前是一幕宏伟壮观却又近乎可怖的景象。</p></li>
<li><p>遮天蔽日的鸽子数千只数千只地飞来，雨点般叠落下来，后来的落在先来的鸽子身上，直到所有的树枝上都渐渐形成硬实的鸽团，大得像是猪头。到处都有不堪重负被鸽团压断的树枝，树枝落下时往往又会压死栖息在下方的数百只鸽子，带着它们一同坠落地面，现场极度喧闹混乱。我发现哪怕是对身旁最近的人说话甚或大吼，对方都听不见。我根本听不见手枪射击的声音，只有在看到猎手重新填装子弹的时候，才意识到他曾经开过枪。</p></li>
<li><p>这样的喧哗声持续了整整一夜，我急于知道这样的声音最远可以传到什么地方，便遣了一个对这片森林很熟悉的人去勘察。两小时后，他回来了，告诉我在三英里外仍然能清晰地听到这里的喧闹声。天将破晓时，鸽群的嘈杂声才逐渐平息下来。其实，森林仍然昏暗不清的时候，鸽子们就开始陆续起飞，朝着与前一个晚上它们飞来的方向完全不同的地方飞去。太阳冉冉升起，所有仍能飞翔的鸽子都已经飞得无影无踪了。</p></li>

<p>Richard Henry Stoddard (b.1825, d. 1903) was born at Hingham, Mass.,
but removed to New York City while quite young. His first volume of
poems, “Foot-prints,” appeared in 1849, and has been followed by many
others. Of these may be mentioned “Songs of Summer,” “Town and Country,”
“The King’s Bell,” “Abraham Lincoln” (an ode), and the “Book of the
East,” from the last of which the following selection is abridged.
Mr. Stoddard’s verses are full of genuine feeling, and some of them show
great poetic power.</p>

<p>THE VIRGINIANS</p>
<p>弗吉尼亚人</p>
<p>William Makepeace Thackeray (b. 1811, d. 1863). This popular English
humorist, essayist, and novelist was born in Calcutta. He was educated
at the Charterhouse school in London, and at Cambridge, but he did not
complete a collegiate course of study. He began his literary career as a
contributor to “Fraser’s Magazine,” under the assumed name of Michael
Angelo Titmarsh, and afterwards contributed to the column of “Punch.”
The first novel published under Thackeray’s own name was “Vanity Fair,”
which is regarded by many as his greatest work. He afterwards wrote a
large number of novels, tales, and poems, most of which were illustrated
by sketches drawn by himself. His course of “Lectures on the English
Humorists” was delivered in London in 1851, and the following year in
several cities in the United States. He revisited the United States in
1856, and delivered a course of lectures on “The Four Georges,” which he
repeated in Great Britain soon after his return home. In 1860 he became
the editor of “The Cornhill Magazine,” the most successful serial ever
published in England.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mr. Esmond called his American house Castlewood, from the
patrimonial [1] home in the old country. The whole usages of Virginia,
indeed, were fondly modeled after the English customs. It was a loyal
colony. The Virginians boasted that King Charles the Second had been
king in Virginia before he had been king in England. English king and
English church were alike faithfully honored there.</p></li>
<li><p>The resident gentry were allied to good English families. They
held their heads above the Dutch traders of New York, and the
money-getting Roundheads of Pennsylvania and New England. Never were
people less republican than those of the great province which was soon
to be foremost in the memorable revolt against the British
Crown.</p></li>
<li><p>The gentry of Virginia dwelt on their great lands after a fashion
almost patriarchal. For its rough cultivation, each estate had a
multitude of hands—of purchased and assigned servants—who were subject
to the command of the master. The land yielded their food, live stock,
and game.</p></li>
<li><p>The great rivers swarmed with fish for the taking. From their
banks the passage home was clear. Their ships took the tobacco off their
private wharves on the banks of the Potomac or the James River, and
carried it to London or Bristol,—bringing back English goods and
articles of home manufacture in return for the only produce which the
Virginian gentry chose to cultivate.</p></li>
<li><p>Their hospitality was boundless. No stranger was ever sent away
from their gates. The gentry received one another, and traveled to each
other’s houses, in a state almost feudal. The question of slavery was
not born at the time of which we write. To be the proprietor of black
servants shocked the feelings of no Virginia gentleman; nor, in truth,
was the despotism exercised over the negro race generally a savage one.
The food was plenty: the poor black people lazy and not unhappy. You
might have preached negro emancipation to Madam Esmond of Castlewood as
you might have told her to let the horses run loose out of her stables;
she had no doubt but that the whip and the corn bag were good for
both.</p></li>
<li><p>Her father may have thought otherwise, being of a skeptical turn
on very many points, but his doubts did not break forth in active
denial, and he was rather disaffected [2] than rebellious, At one
period, this gentleman had taken a part in active life at home, and
possibly might have been eager to share its rewards; but in latter days
he did not seem to care for them. A something had occurred in his life,
which had cast a tinge of melancholy over all his existence.</p></li>
<li><p>He was not unhappy,—to those about him most kind,—most
affectionate, obsequious [3] even to the women of his family, whom he
scarce ever contradicted; but there had been some bankruptcy of his
heart, which his spirit never recovered. He submitted to life, rather
than enjoyed it, and never was in better spirits than in his last hours
when he was going to lay it down.</p></li>
<li><p>When the boys’ grandfather died, their mother, in great state,
proclaimed her eldest son George her successor and heir of the estate;
and Harry, George’s younger brother by half an hour, was always enjoined
to respect his senior. All the household was equally instructed to pay
him honor; the negroes, of whom there was a large and happy family, and
the assigned servants from Europe, whose lot was made as bearable as it
might be under the government of the lady of Castlewood.</p></li>
<li><p>In the whole family there scarcely was a rebel save Mrs. Esmond’s
faithful friend and companion, Madam Mountain, and Harry’s foster
mother, a faithful negro woman, who never could be made to understand
why her child should not be first, who was handsomer, and stronger, and
cleverer than his brother, as she vowed; though, in truth, there was
scarcely any difference in the beauty, strength, or stature of the
twins.</p></li>
<li><p>In disposition, they were in many points exceedingly unlike; but
in feature they resembled each other so closely, that, but for the color
of their hair, it had been difficult to distinguish them. In their beds,
and when their heads were covered with those vast, ribboned nightcaps,
which our great and little ancestors wore, it was scarcely possible for
any but a nurse or a mother to tell the one from the other
child.</p></li>
<li><p>Howbeit, alike in form, we have said that they differed in
temper. The elder was peaceful, studious, and silent; the younger was
warlike and noisy. He was quick at learning when he began, but very slow
at beginning. No threats of the ferule would provoke Harry to learn in
an idle fit, or would prevent George from helping his brother in his
lesson. Harry was of a strong military turn, drilled the little negroes
on the estate, and caned them like a corporal, having many good boxing
matches with them, and never bearing malice if he was worsted;—whereas
George was sparing of blows, and gentle with all about him.</p></li>
<li><p>As the custom in all families was, each of the boys had a special
little servant assigned him: and it was a known fact that George,
finding his little wretch of a blackamoor [4] asleep on his master’s
bed, sat down beside it, and brushed the flies off the child with a
feather fan, to the horror of old Gumbo, the child’s father, who found
his young master so engaged, and to the indignation of Madam Esmond, who
ordered the young negro off to the proper officer for a whipping. In
vain George implored and entreated—burst into passionate tears, and
besought a remission of the sentence. His mother was inflexible
regarding the young rebel’s punishment, and the little negro went off
beseeching his young master not to cry.</p></li>
<li><p>On account of a certain apish drollery and humor which exhibited
itself in the lad, and a liking for some of the old man’s pursuits, the
first of the twins was the grandfather’s favorite and companion, and
would laugh and talk out all his infantine heart to the old gentleman,
to whom the younger had seldom a word to say.</p></li>
<li><p>George was a demure, studious boy, and his senses seemed to
brighten up in the library, where his brother was so gloomy. He knew the
books before he could well-nigh carry them, and read in them long before
he could understand them. Harry, on the other hand, was all alive in the
stables or in the wood, eager for all parties of hunting and fishing,
and promised to be a good sportsman from a very early age.</p></li>
<li><p>At length the time came when Mr. Esmond was to have done with the
affairs of this life, and he laid them down as if glad to be rid of
their burden. All who read and heard that discourse, wondered where
Parson Broadbent of James Town found the eloquence and the Latin which
adorned it. Perhaps Mr. Dempster knew, the boys’ Scotch tutor, who
corrected the proofs of the oration, which was printed, by the desire of
his Excellency and many persons of honor, at Mr. Franklin’s press in
Philadelphia.</p></li>
<li><p>No such sumptuous funeral had ever bean seen in the country as
that which Madam Esmond Warrington ordained for her father, who would
have been the first to smile at that pompous grief.</p></li>
<li><p>The little lads of Castlewood, almost smothered in black trains
and hatbands, headed the procession and were followed by my Lord
Fairfax, from Greenway Court, by his Excellency the Governor of Virginia
(with his coach), by the Randolphs, the Careys, the Harrisons, the
Washingtons, and many others; for the whole country esteemed the
departed gentleman, whose goodness, whose high talents, whose
benevolence and unobtrusive urbanity [5] , had earned for him the just
respect of his neighbors.</p></li>
<li><p>When informed of the event, the family of Colonel Esmond’s
stepson, the Lord Castlewood of Hampshire in England, asked to be at the
charges of the marble slab which recorded the names and virtues of his
lordship’s mother and her husband; and after due time of preparation,
the monument was set up, exhibiting the arms and coronet of the Esmonds,
supported by a little, chubby group of weeping cherubs, and reciting an
epitaph [6] which for once did not tell any falsehoods.</p></li>

<p>威廉·梅克皮斯·萨克雷（1811—1863），这位极受欢迎的英国幽默作家、散文家及小说家出生于印度加尔各答。他曾就读于伦敦的查特豪斯中学，随后进入剑桥大学，但并未完成他的大学学业。他以迈克尔·安吉洛·提玛斯的笔名向《弗雷泽》杂志投稿，后来为《重击》杂志撰写专栏，并由此开始了他的文学生涯。他第一部用真名出版的小说是《名利场》，被公认为他最伟大的作品。后来，他还写了大量的小说、短篇故事和诗歌，其中大部分作品里都附有他自己绘制的插画。
1851年，萨克雷在伦敦发表了一系列“关于英语幽默作家的讲座”，并于次年在美国的几个城市巡回演讲。
1856年，他再度访问美国，发表了一系列“四个乔治”的讲座，随后他返回英国并在国内演讲。
1860年，他成为《康希尔》杂志编辑，这是英国有史以来最成功的杂志期刊。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>埃斯蒙德老先生将他在美国的房子称作卡斯尔伍德庄园，和他在英国的世袭祖产同样的名字。事实上，整个弗吉尼亚州都在热衷效仿大英帝国的各种惯例习俗，这是一个忠诚的殖民地。弗吉尼亚人甚至不惜吹嘘道，在英国登基前，英国国王查理二世就已在弗吉尼亚州被拥戴为王了，英国国王和英国教会也都同样受到弗吉尼亚人的虔诚爱戴。</p></li>
<li><p>弗吉尼亚州的贵族家族往往都能追溯到英国上流社会的背景渊源，他们自恃甚高，看不起在纽约进行贸易的荷兰商人，以及宾夕法尼亚州和新英格兰地区那些拜金的圆颅党人。在北美的这些殖民地里，大概没有比弗吉尼亚人更不愿拥戴共和体制的了，但是，在随后发生的反对英国统治的独立战争中，他们却冲锋在前。</p></li>
<li><p>弗吉尼亚州的贵族世家拥有的地产通常颇为可观，他们管理财产的方式几乎是家族式的：每个庄园都有一定的人手，用来简单耕种土地——不管是购买来的或指派来的奴仆，他们都要听从主人的吩咐，土地为他们提供食物、家畜以及娱乐。</p></li>
<li><p>这里的河流满是取之不竭的渔产，水路通畅方便。他们的船只载着烟草（这是弗吉尼亚上流社会唯一愿意种植的商品），从波托马克河或詹姆斯河岸边的私人码头出发，将货物运送到伦敦或布里斯托尔，然后回程运回那些英国家庭制造的产品，那些该州名望家族视其为可熏陶其家族子女贵族气质的众多商品。</p></li>
<li><p>弗吉尼亚州贵族世家异常豪爽好客，他们从不会空手打发上门的陌生人。在这个近乎封建制的州里，上流社会的达官名媛经常互相登门拜访，彼此设宴款待。在我们写这篇文章的时候，奴隶制问题尚未见争端。弗吉尼亚的绅士们，并不会因为有人拥有黑奴或因为他们对黑奴的专制统治过于野蛮而感到震惊。食物总是丰盛的，黑奴们并不需要干多少活，过得也很滋润。如果你向卡斯尔伍德庄园的埃斯蒙德夫人宣扬黑人解放思想，就像告诉她要把马从马厩中放出来，让它们自由奔跑那样。她会很笃定地告诉你：不管是对黑奴还是马匹，鞭打和玉米对它们来说都是有好处的。</p></li>
<li><p>她的父亲很可能并不这么想。在许多问题上，他都是一个怀疑论者，但他的疑虑从来没有升格为积极反对。他向来都只是不满，而不是叛逆。有一段时期，这位老先生在家里极为活跃，好像想要积极与旁人分享生命带给他的馈赠，但后来他似乎又对此失去了兴趣。他的生活中发生了某些事，在他身上蒙上忧郁的色彩。</p></li>
<li><p>老先生并不是不开心——对周围所有人，他都极为仁慈亲切，甚至到了顺从附和的地步，哪怕对家里的女流之辈亦不例外。对她们所说的话，他几乎从不反驳。但是，有什么东西令他的心破碎了，他再也没能恢复内心的意志。他逆来顺受屈从于生活，而不是自在地去享受它。直到临终之时，他终于能放下心中的负担，撒手人寰，那时他的精神反而显得更好些。</p></li>
<li><p>男孩们的祖父去世后，他们的母亲便成为庄园的主人。她宣布，她的长子乔治是她的继任者及财产继承人；只比乔治晚半小时出生的弟弟哈利，则必须服从哥哥的权威。整个庄园上下都收到同样的指示，要尊重乔治的继承人身份，包括那些黑奴，其中有一个人丁旺盛、幸福和睦的黑奴家庭，还有那些来自欧洲指派的固定奴仆。在卡斯尔伍德庄园的埃斯蒙德夫人的统治下，他们的生活状态还是可以忍受的。</p></li>
<li><p>整个庄园里几乎没发生过一次叛乱，这多亏了埃斯蒙德夫人的忠实朋友和伴侣的帮助：蒙尔汀女士。她是哈利的养母，一个忠心耿耿的黑女人。她从来不能理解，为什么她的养子不能成为继承人，他比他哥哥乔治相貌更英俊，身体更强壮，头脑也更聪明活络，这一点，那位黑人奶妈甚至赌咒发誓。不过，说真的，就相貌、力量或体格而言，这对双胞胎几乎没有任何差异。</p></li>
<li><p>至于性情方面，这两兄弟显然大相径庭。但从外貌特征来看，兄弟俩实在过于相像，如果不是头发颜色有差异，外人的确很难分清兄弟俩。当小兄弟俩上了床，戴上他们的祖先们曾戴过的硕大的缎带睡帽，那么，除了他们的妈妈和保姆以外，再没有人能辨认出他俩谁是谁。</p></li>
<li><p>虽然相貌如此相似，但是，正如方才提到的，他们的脾气秉性却大不相同。哥哥乔治温和好学，且沉默寡言，弟弟哈利却挑衅好战，沉湎嬉闹。刚开始学习的时候，哈利总是学得很快，一旦进入课程，他就变得鲁钝缓慢。来自戒尺的惩戒，没法令游手好闲的哈利静下心来学习，同时，亦无法阻止乔治在学业上帮助他的弟弟。哈利的军事悟性极高，他在庄园里训练小黑奴们，像一名军士那样用藤杖鞭打他们，与他们进行激烈的拳击比赛；哪怕他被打倒，也绝不心怀怨恨。相反，乔治从不与人殴斗，对人总是温和友善。</p></li>
<li><p>正如当地所有上流家庭那样，每个贵族男孩都有一个专门的伺童跟从伺候。乔治有件轶事在当地无人不晓：某天，当乔治发现他的小黑奴居然躺在主人的床上睡着了，他就在床边坐下，拿起一柄羽毛扇给那个小坏蛋拂去飞来的苍蝇。看到小主人手脚一直忙活不停的这一幕，那名小黑奴的父亲甘博的心里深感惊恐；而埃斯蒙德夫人则异常恼怒，命令将那名小黑奴带到房间里鞭打。乔治的祈求全然无用——他竟然号啕大哭，苦苦乞求母亲撤销这场鞭笞。但是，他的母亲压根不会放过对这个黑色小反骨的惩罚，反倒是那名小黑奴恳求他的少爷不要哭泣。</p></li>
<li><p>由于乔治身上所展示出来的孩子般的诙谐和幽默，恰恰与老祖父的嗜好有些不谋而合，这对双胞胎中的哥哥向来是老祖父最喜欢的外孙，经常陪在他左右。在老祖父面前，乔治总是向他尽情袒露孩子的天真和童言无忌，而弟弟哈利则与祖父几乎无话可说。</p></li>
<li><p>乔治是一个娴静好学的孩子，一进入图书馆，他便看起来神采飞扬，而他弟弟却蔫头耷脑，甚为阴郁。在乔治能搬动那些厚重的书本之前，他便认识它们；甚至在无法理解文章内容的时候，便能高声朗读。与他相反，只有在马厩或树林里，哈利才活蹦乱跳，兴致高昂，他喜欢所有狩猎和捕鱼的活动，从小便信誓旦旦地宣称自己会成为一名优秀的体育健将。</p></li>
<li><p>终于，埃斯蒙德老先生告别人世的时间到了，他撒手放下生活中的一切事务，如释重负的解脱似乎让他甚为高兴。凡是读过或听过埃斯蒙德老先生祭文的人，都很好奇詹姆斯镇上的布罗德本特牧师是从哪里找来这篇优美流畅，不时点缀着庄重典雅拉丁语的祭祷文。小兄弟俩的苏格兰家庭教师，登普斯特先生或许深谙其中奥秘。毕竟，是他对这篇祭祷文做了最后润笔，并在弗吉尼亚州州长和其他绅士名流们的授意下，将它拿到费城富兰克林先生的出版社印刷。</p></li>
<li><p>沃灵顿·埃斯蒙德夫人为她父亲举办了葬礼，有史以来，弗吉尼亚州还从未见识过如此盛大奢华的葬礼。在这么豪华的悲伤中，那位离去的逝者恐怕会最先笑出声来。</p></li>
<li><p>卡斯尔伍德庄园的两位少年身穿黑色礼服，戴着缀有黑色缎带的礼帽，心情压抑得几乎喘不过气来。他们走在送葬队伍前面，后面跟随有来自格林威法院的费尔法克斯勋爵，弗吉尼亚州州长阁下（乘坐他的四轮马车赶来），伦道夫夫妇、卡瑞斯夫妇、哈里森夫妇、华盛顿夫妇以及其他众多宾客。全州上下对这位逝世的名流之士致以敬意，他高尚的品德、出众的才华、慷慨的善行和温文尔雅的态度，都为他赢得了乡邻们的尊敬。</p></li>
<li><p>当埃斯蒙德老先生的继子、英国汉普郡卡斯尔伍德勋爵获悉该消息的时候，他主动请求承担继父大理石墓碑的所有费用。墓碑上刻着卡斯尔伍德勋爵的母亲和继父的名称与美德，经过一段时间的准备，这块大理石纪念碑被竖起来了，碑面上刻着埃斯蒙德夫妇的戎装照与爵位冠冕，碑脚下衬有一群胖乎乎的哭泣小天使，小家伙们正在朗诵这篇未见任何漏洞谎言的墓志铭。</p></li>

<p>Fitz-James O’Brien (b. 1828, d. 1862) was of Irish birth, and came to
America in 1852. He has contributed a number of tales and poems to
various periodicals, but his writings have never been collected in book
form. Mr. O’Brien belonged to the New York Seventh Regiment, and died at
Baltimore of a wound received in a cavalry skirmish.</p>

<li>Like spectral hounds across the sky,</li>

<p>The waves with slippery fingers clutch</p>

<p>The white spray beats against the panes</p>
<p>Like some wet ghost that down the air</p>
<p>Is hunted by a troop of fiends,</p>
<p>And seeks a shelter anywhere.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">

<p>For every soul that night at sea,</p>
<p>But more than all for that brave boy</p>
<p>Who used to gayly climb his knee,—</p>
<p>Young Charlie, with his chestnut hair,</p>
<p>And hazel eyes, and laughing lip.</p>
<p>“May Heaven look down,” the old man cries.</p>
<p>“Upon my son, and on his ship!”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>While thus with pious heart he prays,</li>
</ol>
<p>Far in the distance sounds a boom:</p>
<p>He pauses; and again there rings</p>
<p>That sullen thunder through the room.</p>
<p>A ship upon the shoals tonight!</p>
<p>She cannot hold for one half hour;</p>
<p>But clear the ropes and grappling hooks,</p>
<p>And trust in the Almighty Power!</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>On the drenched gallery he stands,</li>
</ol>
<p>Striving to pierce the solid night:</p>
<p>Across the sea the red eye throws</p>
<p>A steady crimson wake of light;</p>
<p>And, where it falls upon the waves,</p>
<p>He sees a human head float by,</p>
<p>With long drenched curls of chestnut hair,</p>
<p>And wild but fearless hazel eye.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Out with the hooks! One mighty fling!</li>
</ol>
<p>Adown the wind the long rope curls.</p>
<p>Oh! will it catch? Ah, dread suspense!</p>
<p>While the wild ocean wilder whirls.</p>
<p>A steady pull; it tightens now:</p>
<p>Oh! his old heart will burst with joy,</p>
<p>As on the slippery rocks he pulls</p>
<p>The breathing body of his boy.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Still sweep the specters through the sky;</li>

<p>Still scud the clouds before the storm;</p>
<p>Still naked in the howling night</p>

<p>Without, the world is wild with rage;</p>
<p>Unkenneled demons are abroad;</p>

<p>Within, there is the peace of God.</p>

<p>HAMLET</p>
<p>哈姆雷特</p>
<p>William Shakespeare (b. 1564, d. 1616), by many regarded as the
greatest poet the world has ever produced, was born at
Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He was married, when very young, to a
woman eight years his senior, went to London, was joint proprietor of
Blackfriar’s Theater in 1589, wrote poems and plays, was an actor,
accumulated some property, and retired to Stratford three or four years
before his death. He was buried in Stratford church, where a monument
has been erected to his memory. This is all that is known of him with
any degree of certainty.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s works consist chiefly of plays and sonnets. They show a
wonderful knowledge of human nature, expressed in language remarkable
for its point and beauty.</p>
<p>(ACT I, SCENE II. HAMLET alone in a room, of the castle.</p>
<p>Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO.)</p>
<p>Hor . Hail, to your lordship!</p>
<p>Ham . I am glad to see you well:</p>
<p>Horatio,—or I do forgot myself.</p>
<p>Hor . The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.</p>
<p>Ham . Sir, my good friend; I’ll change that name with you:</p>
<p>And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?—</p>
<p>Marcellus?</p>
<p>Mar . My good lord—</p>
<p>Ham . I am very glad to see you. [To Ber.] Good even, sir.</p>
<p>But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?</p>
<p>Hor . A truant [1] disposition, good my lord.</p>
<p>Ham . I would not hear your enemy say so,</p>
<p>Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,</p>
<p>To make it truster [2] of your own report</p>
<p>Against yourself: I knew you are no truant.</p>
<p>But what is your affair in Elsinore?</p>
<p>We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</p>
<p>Hor . My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.</p>
<p>Ham . I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;</p>
<p>I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.</p>
<p>Hor . Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.</p>
<p>Ham . Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats</p>
<p>Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.</p>
<p>Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven</p>
<p>Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!</p>
<p>My father!—methinks I see my father.</p>
<p>Hor . Where, my lord?</p>
<p>Ham . In my mind’s eye, Horatio.</p>
<p>Hor . I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</p>
<p>Ham . He was a man, take him for all in all,</p>
<p>I shall not look upon his like again.</p>
<p>Hor . My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</p>
<p>Ham . Saw? who?</p>
<p>Hor . My lord, the king your father.</p>
<p>Ham . The king my father!</p>
<p>Hor . Season your admiration for a while</p>
<p>With an attent [3] ear, till I may deliver [4] ,</p>
<p>Upon the witness of these gentlemen,</p>
<p>This marvel to you.</p>
<p>Ham . For God’s love, let me hear.</p>
<p>Hor . Two nights together had these gentlemen,</p>
<p>Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,</p>
<p>In the dead vast and middle of the night,</p>
<p>Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father,</p>
<p>Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pie [5] .</p>
<p>Appears before them, and with solemn march</p>
<p>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d</p>
<p>By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes,</p>
<p>Within his trucheon’s [6] length; whilst they, distill’d</p>
<p>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</p>
<p>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</p>
<p>In dreadful secrecy impart they did;</p>
<p>And I with them the third night kept the watch:</p>
<p>Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time,</p>
<p>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</p>
<p>The apparition comes: I knew your father;</p>
<p>These hands are not more like.</p>
<p>Ham . But where was this?</p>
<p>Mar . My lord, upon the platform where we watch’d.</p>
<p>Ham . Did you speak to it?</p>
<p>Hor . My lord, I did;</p>
<p>But answer made it none: yet once methought</p>
<p>It lifted up its head and did address</p>
<p>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;</p>
<p>But even then the morning cock crew loud,</p>
<p>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,</p>
<p>And vanish’d from our sight.</p>
<p>Ham . ’T is very strange.</p>
<p>Hor . As I do live, my honor’d lord, ’t is true;</p>
<p>And we did think it writ down in our duty</p>
<p>To let you know of it.</p>
<p>Ham . Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me,</p>
<p>Hold you the watch tonight?</p>
<p>Mar . / Ber . We do, my lord.</p>
<p>Ham . Arm’d, say you?</p>
<p>Mar . / Ber . Arm’d, my lord.</p>
<p>Ham . From top to toe?</p>
<p>Mar . / Ber . My lord, from head to foot.</p>
<p>Ham . Then saw you not his face?</p>
<p>Hor . Oh, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver [7] up.</p>
<p>Ham . What, look’d he frowningly?</p>
<p>Hor . A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</p>
<p>Ham . Pale or red?</p>
<p>Hor . Nay, very pale.</p>
<p>Ham . And fix’d his eyes upon you?</p>
<p>Hor . Most constantly.</p>
<p>Ham . I would I had been there.</p>
<p>Hor . It would have much amazed you.</p>
<p>Ham . Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?</p>
<p>Hor . While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.</p>
<p>Mar . / Ber . Longer, longer.</p>
<p>Hor . Not when I saw’t.</p>
<p>Ham . His beard was grizzled,—no?</p>
<p>Hor . It was, as I have seen it in his life,</p>
<p>A sable silver’d.</p>
<p>Ham . I will watch tonight;</p>
<p>Perchance ’t will walk again.</p>
<p>Hor . I warrant it will.</p>
<p>Ham . If it assume my noble father’s person,</p>
<p>I’ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape</p>
<p>And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,</p>
<p>If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight,</p>
<p>Let it be tenable [8] in your silence still;</p>
<p>And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,</p>
<p>Give it an understanding, but no tongue:</p>
<p>I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:</p>
<p>Upon the platform, ’twixt eleven and twelve,</p>
<p>I’ll visit you.</p>

<p>威廉·莎士比亚（1564—1616），这位被公认为是世上有史以来最伟大的诗人，出生于英国埃文河畔的斯特拉特福。当还很年轻的时候，他便与一位比他大八岁的女人结婚。婚后他去了伦敦，
1589年，他成为黑衣修士剧院的合伙人之一。莎士比亚不仅创作诗歌和戏剧，而且参与演出，当他积累了一些财富后，便退休回到故乡斯特拉特福，三四年后在那里去世。莎士比亚死后被葬在斯特拉特福教堂，为了纪念他，教堂里设有纪念碑。有关他的生平，上述资料确凿可信。莎士比亚作品主要包括戏剧和十四行诗，展示了他把握人性的深彻感悟，其中语言意向与美学境界无人堪比。</p>
<p>（第一幕，第二场。哈姆雷特单独在城堡一间屋内。霍雷修、马塞勒斯与勃那多同上。）</p>
<p>霍雷修：向您致敬，殿下！</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：见你身体健康，我很高兴。你不是霍雷修吗？或许我记忆有误。</p>
<p>霍雷修：我也很高兴看到您，殿下，我永远是您谦卑的仆人。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：不，你是我的好朋友，我倒希望与你不受地位名分之拘。霍雷修，你怎么会从威登堡赶来了？——马赛勒斯呢？</p>
<p>马赛勒斯：在，殿下——</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：见到你真高兴。（对勃那多）晚上好，朋友，但究竟是什么风把你们从威登堡吹来了？</p>
<p>霍雷修：无非是偷闲躲懒罢了，尊贵的殿下。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：我不愿听见你的仇敌说这样的话，你也不能用这样的话来刺痛我的耳朵，好让我相信你对自己的诽谤：我知道你不是个偷闲懒散之徒。但是，你们来埃尔西诺究竟有何公干？你走之前，我们可得好好喝一杯。</p>
<p>霍雷修：殿下，我来参加您父王的葬礼。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：拜托，请别取笑我，朋友，你大概是来参加我母后的婚礼吧。</p>
<p>霍雷修：是的，殿下，这两桩事确实靠得太近了。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：节俭，这一切都是为了节俭，霍雷修！葬礼上剩下的残羹冷炙，正好用来宴请婚礼上的宾客。霍雷修，我宁愿在天堂里遇见我最痛恨的仇人，也不愿看到这样的一天！我的父王！——我仿佛看见我的父王。</p>
<p>霍雷修：在什么地方，殿下？</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：在我心灵的眼睛里，霍雷修。</p>
<p>霍雷修：我曾觐见过他一次，他是一位慈爱君王。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：他是一个堂堂男子，整个说起来，我大概再也看不到像他那样的人了。</p>
<p>霍雷修：殿下，我想我昨晚见到他了。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：见到？见到谁？</p>
<p>霍雷修：见到您的父王，殿下。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：我的父王！</p>
<p>霍雷修：请您不要吃惊，仔细听我将这件奇事告诉您，身旁的这两位便是见证。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：上帝啊，快告诉我。</p>
<p>霍雷修：这两位朋友，马塞勒斯与勃那多，在万籁俱寂的午夜守望的时候，曾经接连两个晚上见到一个很像您父王的身影。那个鬼魂全身披挂着盔甲出现在他们面前，用庄严的步伐缓慢地从他们身边走过。在他们惊骇恐惧的眼前，他三次走过，手中所握的权杖几乎能碰到他们的身上。他们骇得浑身瘫软，只是呆立着不动，一句话都说不出来。万分恐惧中，他们暗地里把这件事告诉了我，于是，我便在第三夜陪着他们一同守望。正如他们所说的一样，那个鬼魂又出现了，无论是时间上或形象上，都与他们所说的一字不差。我见过您的父王，这个鬼魂酷似他生前的模样，就连我这两只手都不及他们彼此的相似。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：可这是在哪儿发生的？</p>
<p>马塞勒斯：就在我们守望的露台上，殿下。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：你们有没有和他说话？</p>
<p>霍雷修：殿下，我问话了，可他没有回答我。不过有一次我觉得他好像抬起头来，仿佛要开口说些什么。可就在这时，晨鸡高声啼叫起来，一听见鸡声，他的身形便很快隐去不见了。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：这太奇怪了。</p>
<p>霍雷修：尊敬的殿下，我敢以性命担保，此事千真万确。我们认为，我们有责任让您知道这件事。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：是的，是的，先生们，但这件事实在令我困惑，你们今晚仍会去守望吗？</p>
<p>马塞勒斯 / 勃那多：是的，殿下。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：你们说他穿着盔甲？</p>
<p>马塞勒斯 / 勃那多：是的，殿下，他穿着盔甲。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：全身披挂？</p>
<p>马塞勒斯 / 勃那多：是的，殿下，从头到脚。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：那么你们没有看见他的脸吗？</p>
<p>霍雷修：我们见到了，殿下。他的面甲是掀起的。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：他看上去是什么表情，像是在发怒吗？</p>
<p>霍雷修：他的脸上悲伤胜过愤怒。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：他面色苍白还是红润？</p>
<p>霍雷修：满脸惨白。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：他的视线紧盯着你？</p>
<p>霍雷修：他直盯着我瞧。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：我真希望当时我也在场。</p>
<p>霍雷修：那一定会使您吃惊万分的。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：多半会的，多半会的，他停留得长久吗？</p>
<p>霍雷修：大概是一个人用不快不慢的速度从一数到一百的时间。</p>
<p>马塞勒斯 / 勃那多：还要长久些，还要长久些。</p>
<p>霍雷修：我见到它的那次，不过这么久。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：他的胡须是斑白的吗？</p>
<p>霍雷修：是的，正如他生前我所见过的那样，乌黑的胡须里略有几根变成白色。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：我今晚也要守夜去，也许它还会出现。</p>
<p>霍雷修：我敢保证，他一定会出现的。</p>
<p>哈姆雷特：倘若那魂灵以我尊贵的父王形象出现，我一定要对他说话，哪怕地狱裂开，撒旦令我噤言，也无法阻挡我。如果你们尚未将你们所见告知他人，那么就请求你们大家继续保持沉默。无论今夜发生什么事情，都请放在心上，万不可逞口舌之强，你们的忠诚会有回报的。好了，再会：今晚十一点钟到十二点钟之间，我会登临露台一探究竟。</p>

<p>DISSERTATION ON ROAST PIG</p>
<p>论烤猪</p>
<p>Charles Lamb (b. 1775, d. 1834) was born in London. He was educated
at Christ’s Hospital, where he was a schoolfellow and intimate friend of
Coleridge. In 1792 he became a clerk in the India House, London, and in
1825 he retired from his clerkship on a pension of 441 Pounds. Lamb
never married, but devoted his life to the care of his sister Mary, who
was at times insane. He wrote “Tales founded on the Plays of
Shakespeare,” and several other works of rare merit; but his literary
fame rests principally on the inimitable “Essays of Elia” (published
originally in the “London Magazine”), from one of which the following
selection is adapted.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mankind, says a Chinese manuscript, which my friend M. was
obliging enough to read and explain to me, for the first seventy
thousand ages ate their meat raw, clawing or biting it from the living
animal, just as they do in Abyssinia to this day.</p></li>
<li><p>This period is not obscurely hinted at by their great Confucius
in the second chapter of his “Mundane Mutations,” where he designates a
kind of golden age by the term Cho-fang, literally the Cooks’ Holiday.
The manuscript goes on to say that the art of roasting, or rather
broiling (which I take to be the elder brother), was accidentally
discovered in the manner following:</p></li>
<li><p>The swineherd, Ho-ti, having gone out into the woods one morning,
as his manner was, to collect mast for his hogs, left his cottage in the
care of his eldest son, Bo-bo, a great lubberly boy, who, being fond of
playing with fire, as younkers [1] of his age commonly are, let some
sparks escape into a bundle of straw, which, kindling quickly, spread
the conflagration over every part of their poor mansion till it was
reduced to ashes.</p></li>
<li><p>Together with the cottage,—a sorry, antediluvian [2] makeshift
[3] of a building, you may think it,—what was of much more importance, a
fine litter of newborn pigs, no less than nine in number, perished.
China pigs have been esteemed a luxury all over the East from the
remotest periods we read of.</p></li>
<li><p>Bo-bo was in the utmost consternation, as you may think, not so
much for the sake of the tenement, which his father and he could easily
build up again with a few dry branches, and the labor of an hour or two,
at any time, as for the loss of the pigs. While he was thinking what he
should say to his father, and wringing his hands over the smoking
remnants of one of those untimely sufferers, an odor assailed his
nostrils unlike any scent which he had before experienced.</p></li>
<li><p>What, could it proceed from? Not from the burnt cottage,—he had
smelt that smell before,—indeed, this was by no means the first accident
of the kind which had occurred through the negligence of this unlucky
young firebrand. Much less did it resemble that of any known herb, weed,
or flower. A premonitory [4] moistening at the same time overflowed his
nether lip. He knew not what to think.</p></li>
<li><p>He next stooped down to feel the pig, if there were any signs of
life in it. He burnt his fingers, and to cool them he applied them in
his booby fashion to his mouth. Some of the crumbs of the scorched skin
had come away with his fingers, and for the first time in his life (in
the world’s life, indeed, for before him no man had known it) he
tasted—crackling! Again he felt and fumbled at the pig. It did not burn
him so much now; still he licked his fingers from a sort of
habit.</p></li>
<li><p>The truth at length broke into his slow understanding that it was
the pig that smelt so, and the pig that tasted so delicious; and
surrendering himself up to the newborn pleasure, he fell to tearing up
whole handfuls of the scorched skin with the flesh next it, and was
cramming it down his throat in his beastly fashion, when his sire
entered amid the smoking rafters, armed with a retributory [5] cudgel,
and, finding how affairs stood, began to rain blows upon the young
rogue’s shoulders as thick as hailstones, which Bo-bo heeded not any
more than if they had been flies.</p></li>
<li><p>His father might lay on, but he could not beat him from his pig
till he had fairly made an end of it, when, becoming a little more
sensible of his situation, something like the following dialogue
eusued:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“You graceless whelp, what have you got there devouring? Is it not
enough that you have burnt me down three houses with your dog’s tricks,
and be hanged to you! but you must be eating fire, and I know not what?
What have you got there, I say?”</p>
<p>“O father, the pig, the pig! do come and taste how nice the burnt pig
eats!”</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>The ears of Ho-ti tingled with horror. He cursed his son, and he
cursed himself that he should ever have a son that should eat burnt
pig.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bo-bo, whose scent was wonderfully sharpened since morning, soon
raked out another pig, and, fairly rending it asunder, thrust the lesser
half by main force into the fists of Ho-ti, still shouting out, “Eat,
eat, eat the burnt pig, father! only taste! Oh!” with such like
barbarous ejaculations, cramming all the while as if he would choke.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>Ho-ti trembled in every joint while he grasped the abominable
thing, wavering whether he should not put his son to death for an
unnatural young monster, when the crackling scorching his fingers, as it
had done his son’s, and applying the same remedy to them, he in his turn
tasted some of its flavor, which, make what sour mouths he would for a
pretense, proved not altogether displeasing to him. In conclusion (for
the manuscript here is a little tedious), both father and son fairly sat
down to the mess, and never left off till they had dispatched all that
remained of the litter.</p></li>
<li><p>Bo-bo was strictly enjoined [6] not to let the secret escape, for
the neighbors would certainly have stoned them for a couple of
abominable wretches, who could think of improving upon the good meat
which God had sent them. Nevertheless strange stories got about. It was
observed that Ho-ti’s cottage was burnt down now more frequently than
ever. Nothing but fires from this time forward. Some would break out in
broad day, others in the night-time; and Ho-ti himself, which was the
more remarkable, instead of chastising his son, seemed to grow more
indulgent to him than ever.</p></li>
<li><p>At length they were watched, the terrible mystery discovered, and
father and son summoned to take their trial at Pekin, then an
inconsiderable assize town. Evidence was given, the obnoxious [7] food
itself produced in court, and verdict about to be pronounced, when the
foreman of the jury begged that some of the burnt pig, of which the
culprits stood accused, might be handed into the box.</p></li>
<li><p>He handled it, and they all handled it; and burning their
fingers, as Bo-bo and his father had done before them, and nature
prompting to each of them the same remedy, against the face of all the
facts, and the clearest charge which the judge had ever given,—to the
surprise of the whole court, townsfolk, strangers, reporters, and all
present,—without leaving the box, or any manner of consultation
whatever, they brought in a simultaneous verdict of “Not
Guilty.”</p></li>
<li><p>The judge, who was a shrewd fellow, winked at the manifest
iniquity of the decision; and when the court was dismissed, went
privily, and bought up all the pigs that could be had for love or money.
In a few days his lordship’s townhouse was observed to be on
fire.</p></li>
<li><p>The thing took wing, and now there was nothing to be seen but
fire in every direction. Fuel and pigs grew enormously dear all over the
district. The insurance offices one and all shut up shop. People built
slighter and slighter every day, until it was feared that the very
science of architecture would in no long time be lost to the
world.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus this custom of firing houses continued till in process of
time, says my manuscript, a sage arose, like our Locke, who made a
discovery that the flesh of swine, or indeed of any other animal, might
be cooked (burnt, as they called it) without the necessity of consuming
a whole house to dress it.</p></li>
<li><p>Then first began the rude form of a gridiron. Roasting by the
string or spit came in a century or two later; I forget in whose dynasty
[8] . By such slow degrees, concludes the manuscript, do the most
useful, and seemingly the most obvious, arts make their way among
mankind.</p></li>
<li><p>Without placing too implicit [9] faith in the account above
given, it must be agreed that if a worthy pretext for so dangerous an
experiment as setting houses on fire (especially in these days) could be
assigned in favor of any culinary [10] object that pretext and excuse
might be found in Roast Pig.</p></li>

<p>查尔斯·兰姆（1775—1834）出生于英国伦敦。他曾就读于教会医院，在那里，他与诗人柯勒律治成为同学和亲密好友。
1792年，他成为一名伦敦东印度公司职员，
1825年退休，每年领取四百四十一英镑的退休金。兰姆终生未婚，倾其一生照顾他的姐姐玛丽，玛丽患有精神错乱，时常发作。兰姆《莎士比亚戏剧故事集》以及其他一些作品都很出众，但独具一格的《伊利亚随笔集》（最初发表于《伦敦杂志》）奠定了他的文学声誉，下面这篇文章便改编自这本随笔集。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>人类，据我的朋友M曾体贴地为我朗读并详加解释的一本中国古代手抄书里说，在最初七万年里茹毛饮血，直接从活的动物身上撕扯咬下血淋淋的生肉来充饥，与野蛮落后的阿比西尼亚
[11] 人所用的方法一样。</p></li>
<li><p>中国伟大的圣人孔子在《春秋》一书第二章里清楚地提到一个人类的黄金时代，他将这个时代称为“庖房”，照其字面意思就是“厨师的节日”。这份抄本上还说，烤肉，或者更确切地说，烧肉（我认为它出现得更早）的手艺不过是人类不经意的发现，或许经过应该这样：</p></li>
<li><p>一天早晨，猪倌何悌像往常一样，去树林里给猪采集橡树果实，留下他的大儿子宝宝看家。愚笨冥顽的儿子宝宝跟那些与他同龄的孩子一样，喜欢玩火。他不小心将火星子溅到一捆稻草上，稻草很快燃烧起来，火势迅速蔓延，舔舐着那间狭小茅屋，直到将其彻底烧成灰烬。</p></li>
<li><p>不只是茅屋——抱歉，虽说是茅屋，但你可以想象的出，其实那只不过是一间远古时代潦草搭建的简陋窝棚。更糟糕的是，大火还将刚生下的一窝健健康康的小猪仔也都烧死了，至少有九只。据史料记载，中国猪在整个东方向来被尊为奢华的食品。</p></li>
<li><p>因此，不难想象，宝宝当时吓得要死，倒不是因为烧掉了茅屋，而是因为烧死了小猪。那种茅屋，随便拈来三两根枯枝干柴，他父亲和他不管什么时候，只消花上一两个小时就可重新铺盖完毕。他着急地绞着手，寻思着该怎么向他父亲交代，眼前一具烧焦的小猪崽冒出缕缕青烟，这时，一股生平从未曾闻到过的香味扑鼻而来。</p></li>
<li><p>天哪，这么美味的香味是哪里飘来的？不是从烧毁的茅屋里——那种焦味他以前就曾闻到过。诚然，对这个喜欢玩火的倒霉孩子来说，这可绝不是他酿成的第一宗意外事件。这种味道，也一点都不像那些他所熟悉的草药、野草或鲜花的香味。像是有了什么预感似的，口水开始沿着他的下嘴唇流了下来，尽管他对眼前的一切仍丝毫摸不着头绪。</p></li>
<li><p>他弯下腰，摸摸面前的小猪，想看看它是否还有一丁点气息。手指头被烫了一下，他赶紧将手指放进嘴里傻乎乎地舔着，让它凉下来。烧焦乳猪的零星碎皮碰巧沾到他的指头上，于是，他平生第一次（事实上，也是人类有史以来的第一次，因为在他之前，还从未有人体会过）尝到——焦脆烤猪皮的美味！然后，他再次探手在小猪身上摸了摸，炙热的烤猪不再那么灼烫，但他习惯性地又吮吸了一下手指。</p></li>
<li><p>此刻，一向迟钝的他突然理解了事实真相：原来，这股奇妙无比的诱人香味来自这只火中乳猪，尝起来这么美味的，也是这只小猪。完全沉醉在这种前所未有的快乐中，他一屁股坐在地上，大把大把地将这烤乳猪连皮带肉地撕下，像野兽般狼吞虎咽，忙不迭地只管往嘴里塞。这时，他父亲手里拿着根惩戒棒，走进仍在冒烟的椽木，看见家里变得这般惨不忍睹，举起手里的棍棒下冰雹一般狠命打在这个小混蛋的肩上。美味当前的宝宝浑然不觉，不过像被苍蝇叮了几口似的。</p></li>
<li><p>他父亲不管如何棍棒不断，都无法令宝宝放下手里的烤猪肉。直到将那只小猪吃得一干二净，他才似乎略微明白了眼前的处境，接下来父子间没准有如下对话：</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“你这不知羞耻的小兔崽子，你在那里吞吃什么？你那些混帐把戏把咱家房子烧毁了三次，还嫌不够吗？你这天杀的！你还非要吃火！你给我说，你到底在那儿吞吃什么？”</p>
<p>“啊，爸爸，小猪，是小猪！赶紧过来尝尝，烧过的小猪太好吃了！”</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>何悌听到耳里，嗡的一声吓坏了。他咒骂着他的儿子，也责骂自己生了这么个儿子，竟然敢吃烧焦的猪。</li>
</ol>
<p>宝宝的嗅觉从今早开始磨炼得特别敏锐，哗啦一声，很快便从火堆里刨出另一头烤猪。他猛地一撕两半，将较小的那一半硬是塞到何悌的拳头里，大声说：“快吃，快吃，爸爸，快尝尝这烧焦的小猪！你先尝尝！天哪！”他一边粗野地喊叫着，一边乐不可支地猛塞猛嚼，也不怕噎着。</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>何悌手里抓着这见鬼的东西，气得浑身关节都在发抖，琢磨着到底该不该将这儿子当作一个违天悖理的小怪物给弄死。这时，炙热的烤猪皮烫伤了他的手指，就像曾烫伤他儿子的手指那样；和他儿子一样，何悌也将手指放进嘴里吮吸。这下，他也尝到了烤猪皮的美味。虽然他装模作样地撇撇嘴，但心里却乐开了花。末了（手抄本在这里的描述有点冗长），父亲和儿子都安然坐在废墟上，拉开架势大吃特吃，直到将一群烤小猪风卷残云扫荡精光。</p></li>
<li><p>何悌严厉叮嘱宝宝，绝不能吐露半点风声，否则，他们父子俩一定会被视为邪恶的怪物，死于那些街坊邻居的乱石棍棒之下，因为他们竟敢胡乱改变上帝赐下的好好的食物。尽管这样，奇怪的流言还是不胫而走。有人留意到，何悌家的茅屋隔三岔五的就被烧坍，火灾比往常更加频繁。从那时起，他们家的火灾似乎就没消停过：有时青天白日莫名失火，有时夜半三更火灾光临。何悌本人举止愈发让人狐疑，他不再严厉斥责他的儿子，反倒比以往任何时候都更纵容他。</p></li>
<li><p>后来，他们受到严密监控，这个可怕的秘密终于真相大白。这一对父子被传唤到北京严加审问，那时北京城的规模要比现在小得多，只是个不大的民间巡回审判的村落小镇。在法庭上，弥天大罪的证据被呈送至陪审团面前，这可憎的食物也被呈上法庭，判决即将宣判之前，突然，陪审团长老请求将犯罪嫌疑人据以被控诉的烤乳猪送到陪审席上审查。</p></li>
<li><p>烤乳猪被呈上了，陪审团长老摸了摸它，陪审员们随之效仿。他们的手指都被烫疼了，就像宝宝和他父亲曾做过的那样，天性促使他们缩回手指，放在嘴里吮吸。接着，无视所有的事实证据，也无视法官清晰的指示——令法庭上所有人，包括围观的市斤小民，过往路人，嚼舌之徒，以及所有在场的人瞠目结舌的是：陪审团既不退席讨论，也未经任何形式的磋商咨询，就一致做出了“无罪”判决。</p></li>
<li><p>法官是个精明的家伙，在这种明显有违常理的判决面前琢磨起心思。带到散庭后，他偷偷摸摸到市场上，连买带要地买下了所有小猪。几天后，法官大人的宅邸眼看着就起火了。</p></li>
<li><p>这种稀罕事简直长了翅膀，这下好了，到处都有此起彼伏的火光冒出。这片地区的柴木和小猪价格都大为上涨，保险公司一家接一家地关门大吉。日复一日，人们建的屋舍越发潦草简陋，到后来有人开始担心，盖房这门技艺无须良久就会失传，无人继承。</p></li>
<li><p>这本手抄本里说，于是，点房子烧小猪的习俗就这样流传下来，直到一位类似我国的洛克那样的哲人出世。他发现：不管是猪肉，还是其他动物的肉类，无需烧掉整栋房子，就能烹制为食物（或者，用他们的说法，烧熟）。</p></li>
<li><p>就这样，粗陋的烤架最先问世。一两百年后，出现了用绳子挂着或用铁叉叉着的烧烤方式，我可真忘了这事发生在哪朝哪代。这部手抄本总结道，人类生活中最为实用、看起来最显而易见的技艺，就是这样一步步慢慢发展起来的。</p></li>
<li><p>无须对上述的历史记载太信以为真，但是，我们必须同意：对于那些放火烧屋的危险实验（尤其是在那个时候），如果我们想找一个烹饪目的为它们开脱，那么，烤乳猪无疑是个正当合适的理由和借口。</p></li>

<p>William Black (b.1841, d.1898) is one of the leading modern novelist
of England. The scenes of his stories are for the most part laid in
Scotland, and he excels in the delineation of Scotch character. But his
most remarkable power is seen in those vivid, poetical descriptions of
scenery, of which the following selection, adapted from “The Princess of
Thule,” is a good example. Mr. Black’s most noted works, in addition to
the one named, are: “A Daughter of Heth,” “The Strange Adventures of a
Phaeton,” “Kilmeny,” and “McLeod of Dare.”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lavender had already transformed Sheila into a heroine during the
half hour of their stroll from the beach and around the house; and as
they sat at dinner on this still, brilliant evening in summer, he
clothed her in the garments of romance.</p></li>
<li><p>Her father, with his great, gray beard and heavy brow, became the
King of Thule, living in this solitary house overlooking the sea, and
having memories of a dead sweetheart. His daughter, the Princess, had
the glamour [1] of a thousand legends dwelling in her beautiful eyes;
and when she walked by the shores of the Atlantic, that were now getting
yellow under the sunset, what strange and unutterable thoughts must
appear in the wonder of her face!</p></li>
<li><p>After dinner they went outside and sat down on a bench in the
garden. It was a cool and pleasant evening. The sun had gone down in red
fire behind the Atlantic, and there was still left a rich glow of
crimson in the west, while overhead, in the pale yellow of the sky, some
filmy clouds of rose color lay motionless. How calm was the sea out
there, and the whiter stretch of water coming into Loch [2] Roag! The
cool air of the twilight was scented with sweetbrier. The wash of the
ripples along the coast could be heard in the stillness.</p></li>
<li><p>The girl put her hand on her father’s head, and reminded him that
she had had her big greyhound, Bras, imprisoned all the afternoon, and
that she had to go down to Borvabost with a message for some people who
were leaving by the boat in the morning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“But you can not go away down to Borvabost by yourself, Sheila,”
said</p>
<p>Ingram. “It will be dark before you return.”</p>
<p>“It will not be darker than this all the night through,” said the
girl.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>“But I hope you will let us go with you,” said Lavender, rather
anxiously; and she assented with a gracious smile, and went to fetch the
great deerhound that was her constant companion. And lo! he found
himself walking with a Princess in this wonderland, through the magic
twilight that prevails in northern latitudes. Mackenzie and Ingram had
gone to the front. The large deerhound, after regarding him attentively,
had gone to its mistress’s side, and remained closely there.</p></li>
<li><p>Even Sheila, when they had reached the loftiest part of their
route, and could see beneath them the island and the water surrounding
it, was struck by the exceeding beauty of the twilight; and as for her
companion, he remembered it many a time thereafter, as if it were a
dream of the sea.</p></li>
<li><p>Before them lay the Atlantic—a pale line of blue, still, silent,
and remote. Overhead the sky was of a clear, thin gold, with heavy
masses of violet cloud stretched across from north to south, and
thickening as they got near the horizon. Down at their feet, near the
shore, a dusky line of huts and houses was scarcely visible; and over
these lay a pale blue film of peat [3] smoke that did not move in the
still air.</p></li>
<li><p>Then they saw the bay into which the White Water runs, and they
could trace the yellow glimmer of the river stretching into the island
through a level valley of bog and morass. Far away towards the east lay
the bulk of the island,—dark green undulations of moorland and pasture;
and there, in the darkness, the gable of one white house had caught the
clear light of the sky, and was gleaming westward like a star.</p></li>
<li><p>But all this was as nothing to the glory that began to shine in
the southeast, where the sky was of a pale violet over the peaks of
Mealasabhal and Suainabhal. There, into the beautiful dome, rose the
golden crescent of the moon, warm in color, as though it still retained
the last rays of the sunset. A line of quivering gold fell across Loch
Roag, and touched the black hull and spars of the boat in which Sheila
had been sailing in the morning.</p></li>
<li><p>That bay down there, with its white sands and massive rocks, its
still expanse of water, and its background of mountain peaks palely
covered by the yellow moonlight, seemed really a home for a magic
princess who was shut off from all the world. But here, in front of
them, was another sort of sea, and another sort of life,—a small fishing
village hidden under a cloud of pale peat smoke, and fronting the great
waters of the Atlantic itself, which lay under a gloom of violet
clouds.</p></li>
<li><p>On the way home it was again Lavender’s good fortune to walk with
Sheila across the moorland path they had traversed some little time
before. And now the moon was still higher in the heavens, and the yellow
lane of light that crossed the violet waters of Loch Roag quivered in a
deeper gold. The night air was scented with the Dutch clover growing
down by the shore. They could hear the curlew [4] whistling and the
plover [5] calling amid that monotonous plash of the waves that murmured
all around the coast.</p></li>
<li><p>When they returned to the house, the darker waters of the
Atlantic and the purple clouds of the west were shut out from sight; and
before them there was only the liquid plain of Loch Roag, with its
pathway of yellow fire, and far away on the other side the shoulders and
peaks of the southern mountains, that had grown gray and clear and sharp
in the beautiful twilight. And this was Sheila’s home.</p></li>

<p>NOTES.—Of the characters mentioned in this selection, Sheila is a
young Scotch girl living on the small island of Borva, which her father
owns; it lies just west of Lewis, one of the Hebrides. Ingram is an old
friend and frequent visitor, while Lavender, a friend of Ingram’s, is on
his first visit to the island.</p>

<p>威廉·布莱克（1841—1898）是现代英国小说家的领军人物之一。他笔下大部分的故事都以苏格兰为背景，且极为擅长刻画苏格兰人物个性。然而，他生动而富有诗意的风景描写最为世人推崇，下面这篇节选自他的名作《极北之地的公主》便是极好佐证。除此之外，布莱克最著名的作品还有《赫斯的女儿》、《四轮敞篷马车里的奇异冒险》、《基尔门尼》以及《勇猛的麦克劳德》。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>在海滩以及住处周边半小时的散步途中，拉文德紧随希拉左右，对她百依百顺。夏季的黄昏，周围寂静极了，天空明亮依旧，当两人准备坐在桌前吃晚餐时，拉文德为希拉披上浪漫色调的外套。</p></li>
<li><p>希拉的父亲，长有一副浓密的灰色胡须，眉头粗黑，住在这处可以俯瞰大海的孤零零房舍里，心里珍藏着对爱人的美好回忆，俨然一位威严的极地之王。他的女儿希拉，极地公主，她那美丽深邃的眼睛，像是闪烁着千年传说的光芒；夕阳西下，天空金光夺目四溢，她信步走在大西洋的海岸边，漂亮脸庞上露出的是多么奇异又难以言说的神秘！</p></li>
<li><p>晚餐后，他们走到屋外，在花园的长椅上坐了下来。凉风送爽，夏季的傍晚令人心旷神怡。太阳裹着一团红色烈焰，已经落入寥廓的大西洋，但西边天陲仍残留着饱满绚烂的艳红。他们头顶上浅黄色的天空中，几朵朦胧的玫瑰色云彩静静地停在那里。身边大海安然若素，粼粼银光的海面绵逶迤绵延到远处的洛赫罗格海湾！暮色里凉风袭人，多花蔷薇暗香浮动。静谧中，你能听到细浪拍打沙滩的声音。</p></li>
<li><p>姑娘将手放在父亲头上，提醒他，她的大型猎犬布莱丝已经被关了整整一个下午，而她必须要去博沃波斯特给人送信，那些人第二天一早就要乘船离开。</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“可你不能一个人去博沃波斯特，希拉，”英格拉姆说，“回来的路上，恐怕你还没到家，天就会黑了。”</p>
<p>“不会的，整个夜里都不会比现在更黑。”姑娘说。</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>“最好还是让我们和你一起去吧。”拉文德焦急地说。希拉对他露出一个亲切的微笑，表示赞同，接着便去牵她那头体型庞大的猎鹿犬，这条猎犬总是与她形影不离。嘿！拉文德发现自己在这块梦幻之地与公主一起，穿越北纬奇异的暮光。麦肯齐和英格拉姆已经走到前面去了，那头大型猎犬警觉地嗅了嗅他，接着便走到女主人身旁，紧紧依偎着她。</p></li>
<li><p>当他们到达途中海拔最高处，可以看到脚下的整座岛屿和周边大海时，即使是希拉，也被这精美绝伦的暮光所震撼。至于她的同伴，他事后曾无数次回想起这一幕，仿佛那是一片梦幻的海洋。</p></li>
<li><p>大西洋横卧眼前——那是寂静遥远的一抹蓝色海平线。他们头顶上是清澈的淡金色天空，紫罗兰般饱满的云朵从南往北横铺苍穹，越接近地平面，云朵便越丰满。在他们脚下，那块毗邻海岸的地方，成排的房屋村舍隐约可见；一炷蓝色泥煤烧出的炊烟淡淡升起，在静谧的空气中停留不散。</p></li>
<li><p>然后，他们看见白色海水奔流进入海湾。目光追随着湾流，他们看到河水金色的波光粼粼，流过同一水平面的山谷间的沼泽与泥塘，最后流入那座小岛。岛屿大半向东边延伸很远，很远，墨绿色的沼泽地和牧场像波浪般起伏。在远处的黑暗中，一栋白色房子的三角墙反射着天空的亮光，亮光闪烁着向西移动，宛若一颗明亮的半空星辰。</p></li>
<li><p>不过，和东南方开始闪耀的光辉相比，上述风景委实不算什么。此刻的东南方，美娜沙巴和苏恩那巴山巅上，天空洇出一抹浅淡紫色。在那美丽的天穹中，一轮金色的新月正缓缓升起，色调温暖，仿佛挽住了夕阳最后一缕光辉。一道金光泻落，颤抖地粼粼扫过洛赫罗格海湾，扫过黢黑的船身和桅杆——那条当天清晨希拉扬帆出海的小船。</p></li>
<li><p>脚下的那道海湾沙滩洁白，巨石嶙峋，水面宽阔；在它背后，山峰淡淡地披着金黄色的月光，好一处与世隔绝中极地公主的奇妙家园。眼前大海自有别样迷人风情，别有不同特色生活——一个小渔村藏匿在朦胧的泥煤烟雾当中，面朝着波涛壮阔的大西洋。而此时的大西洋，正静静躺在铺满紫色云团的苍穹下。</p></li>
<li><p>对拉文德来说，回家路上的他，真是幸运再度光临，能与希拉携手走过不久前他们才刚颇为艰难穿越过的沼泽地。此时，月亮在空中升得更高，在洛赫罗格海湾紫色的水面上，那条黄色狭长的倒影颤动成深金色。夜风习习，弥漫出岸边荷兰三叶草的清新芬芳。沙滩四周，海浪单调如一的拍打声细碎呢喃，拉文德和希拉甚至还能听到麻鹬的啁啾和凤头麦鸡的鸣啼。</p></li>
<li><p>当他们回到家里，大西洋深暗的海水和西边天空中紫色的云彩都已经看不到了。在他们面前，是偌大清澈的洛赫罗格海湾，延伸出一条金黄似火的水道。远处，南部绵亘山脊的山脊或巅峰在美丽的暮光中变成灰色，轮廓清晰，棱角分明。这，就是希拉的家园。</p></li>

was the valedictorian of his class at Harvard College, where he
graduated in 1832. He shortly afterwards entered the ministry, and had
charge of a congregation at Newport, R.I. He was a great student of
German literature, and began his own literary career by a translations
of Schiller’s “William Tell.” This was followed by numerous translations
from the German, mainly poetry, which have been published from time to
time, in several volumes. Of these translations, Goethe’s “Faust,”
Richter’s “Titan” and “Hesperus,” and a humorous poem by Dr. Karl Arnold
Kortum, “The Life, Opinions, Actions, and Fate of Hieronimus Jobs, the
Candidate,” deserve especial mention. Mr. Brooks also published a number
of original poems, addresses, etc.</p>

<p>人生的一幕</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson (b. 1709, d. 1784). This remarkable man was born in
Lichfield, Staffordshire, England. He was the son of a bookseller and
stationer. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1728; but his poverty
compelled him to leave at the end of three years. Soon after his
marriage, in 1736, he opened a private school, but obtained only three
pupils, one of whom was David Garrick, afterwards a celebrated actor. In
1737, he removed to London, where he resided most of the rest of his
life. The most noted of his numerous literary works are his
“Dictionary,” the first one of the English language worthy of mention,
“The Vanity of Human Wishes,” a poem, “The Rambler,” “Rasselas,” “The
Lives of the English Poets,” and his edition of Shakespeare. An annual
pension of 300 pounds was granted him in 1762. In person, Johnson was
heavy and awkward; in manner, boorish and overbearing; but his learning
and his great powers caused his company to be sought by many eminent
men.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Obidah, the son of Abnesina, left the caravansary [1] early in
the morning, and pursued his journey through the plains of Hindostan. He
was fresh and vigorous with rest; he was animated with hope; he was
incited by desire; he walked swiftly forward over the valleys, and saw
the hills gradually rising before him.</p></li>
<li><p>As he passed along, his ears were delighted with the morning song
of the bird of paradise; he was fanned by the last flutters of the
sinking breeze, and sprinkled with dew by groves of spices; he sometimes
contemplated the towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and
sometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primrose, eldest daughter
of the spring; all his senses were gratified, and all care was banished
from his heart.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus he went on, till the sun approached his meridian, and the
increasing heat preyed upon his strength; he then looked round about him
for some more commodious path. He saw, on his right hand, a grove that
seemed to wave its shades as a sign of invitation; he entered it, and
found the coolness and verdure irresistibly pleasant. He did not,
however, forget whither he was traveling, but found a narrow way,
bordered with flowers, which appeared to have the same direction with
the main road, and was pleased, that, by this happy experiment, he had
found means to unite pleasure with business, and to gain the rewards of
diligence without suffering its fatigues.</p></li>
<li><p>He, therefore, still continued to walk for a time, without the
least remission of his ardor, except that he was sometimes tempted to
stop by the music of the birds, which the heat had assembled in the
shade, and sometimes amused himself with picking the flowers that
covered the banks on each side, or the fruits that hung upon the
branches. At last, the green path began to decline from its first
tendency, and to wind among the hills and thickets, cooled with
fountains, and murmuring with waterfalls.</p></li>
<li><p>Here Obidah paused for a time, and began to consider whether it
was longer safe to forsake the known and common track; but, remembering
that the heat was now in its greatest violence, and that the plain was
dusty and uneven, he resolved to pursue the new path, which he supposed
only to make a few meanders [2] , in compliance with the varieties of
the ground, and to end at last in the common road.</p></li>
<li><p>Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed his pace, though he
suspected he was not gaining ground. This uneasiness of his mind
inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every
sensation that might soothe or divert him. He listened to every echo, he
mounted every hill for a fresh prospect, he turned aside to every
cascade, and pleased himself with tracing the course of a gentle river
that rolled among the trees, and watered a large region, with
innumerable circumvolutions [3] .</p></li>
<li><p>In these amusements, the hours passed away uncounted; his
deviations [4] had perplexed his memory, and he knew not toward what
point to travel. He stood pensive and confused, afraid to go forward
lest he should go wrong, yet conscious that the time of loitering was
now past. While he was thus tortured with uncertainty, the sky was
overspread with clouds, the day vanished from before him, and a sudden
tempest gathered round his head.</p></li>
<li><p>He was now roused by his danger to a quick and painful
remembrance of his folly; he now saw how happiness is lost when ease is
consulted; he lamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to seek
shelter in the grove, and despised the petty curiosity that led him on
from trifle to trifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew
blacker and a clap of thunder broke his meditation.</p></li>
<li><p>He now resolved to do what remained yet in his power; to tread
back the ground which he had passed, and try to find some issue where
the wood might open into the plain. He prostrated himself upon the
ground, and commended his life to the Lord of nature. He rose with
confidence and tranquillity, and pressed on with his saber in his hand;
for the beasts of the desert were in motion, and on every hand were
heard the mingled howls of rage, and fear, and ravage, and expiration
[5] ; all the horrors of darkness and solitude surrounded him; the winds
roared in the woods, and the torrents tumbled from the hills.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, forlorn and distressed, he wandered through the wild
without knowing whither he was going or whether he was every moment
drawing nearer to safety or to destruction. At length, not fear but
labor began to overcome him; his breath grew short, and his knees
trembled, and he was on the point of lying down, in resignation to his
fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He
advanced toward the light, and finding that it proceeded from the
cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained
admission. The old man set before him such provisions as he had
collected for himself, on which Obidah fed with eagerness and
gratitude.</p></li>
<li><p>When the repast was over, “Tell me,” said the hermit, “by what
chance thou hast been brought hither; I have been now twenty years an
inhabitant of this wilderness, in which I never saw a man before.”
Obidah then related the occurrences of his journey, without any
concealment or palliation [6] .</p></li>
<li><p>“Son,” said the hermit, “let the errors and follies, the dangers
and escapes, of this day, sink deep into your heart. Remember, my son,
that human life is the journey of a day. We rise in the morning of
youth, full of vigor, and full of expectation; we set forward with
spirit and hope, with gayety and with diligence, and travel on awhile in
the straight road of piety toward the mansions of rest. In a short time
we remit our fervor, and endeavor to find some mitigation [7] of our
duty, and some more easy means of obtaining the same end.</p></li>
<li><p>“We then relax our vigor, and resolve no longer to be terrified
with crimes at a distance, but rely upon our own constancy, and venture
to approach what we resolve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of
ease, and repose in the shades of security. Here the heart softens, and
vigilance subsides; we are then willing to inquire whether another
advance can not be made, and whether we may not at least turn our eyes
upon the gardens of pleasure. We approach them with scruple and
hesitation; we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always
hope to pass through them without losing the road of virtue, which we
for a while keep in our sight, and to which we propose to
return.</p></li>
<li><p>“But temptation succeeds temptation, and one compliance prepares
us for another; we, in time, lose the happiness of innocence, and solace
our disquiet with sensual gratifications. By degrees we let fall the
remembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate [8]
object of rational desire. We entangle ourselves in business, immerge
ourselves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths [9] of inconstancy
till the darkness of old age begins to invade us, and disease and
anxiety obstruct our way. We then look back upon our lives with horror,
with sorrow, and with repentance; and wish, but too often vainly wish,
that we had not forsaken the paths of virtue.</p></li>
<li><p>“Happy are they, my son, who shall learn, from thy example, not
to despair, but shall remember that though the day is past, and their
strength is wasted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that
reformation is never hopeless, nor sincere endeavors ever unassisted;
that the wanderer may at length return after all his errors; and that he
who implores strength and courage from above, shall find danger and
difficulty give way before him. Go now, my son, to thy repose: commit
thyself to the care of Omnipotence; and when the morning calls again to
toil, begin anew thy journey and thy life.”</p></li>

<li><p>奥拜德，阿比内斯纳的儿子，清早离开了商队旅馆，继续他穿越印度斯坦大平原的旅程。一宿安睡后，他神清气爽，精力充沛，心中充满了希望。他被内心的欲望所激励着，快步地穿山越谷，一片山峦渐渐地耸立眼前。</p></li>
<li><p>奥拜德沿路前行，耳边传来清晨鸟儿悦耳的啁啾声，像是来自天堂的歌声；微风轻柔阵阵拂面，灌木丛林露水清凉。有时，他会停下脚步，惊叹那树冠遮日的高大橡树，穆然耸立彰显山岭帝王的大家风范；有时，他又会沉浸在蓬勃怒放的迎春花温柔的馨香中，那是春天初生的女儿。他的身心被眼前美景轻轻抚慰，所有的忧虑一股脑儿烟消云散。</p></li>
<li><p>他就这样不停地走着，直到太阳慢慢升到头顶，酷日灼热不断地消耗他的力气。于是，他四处打量，看是否能找到一条更凉爽的路径。就在那时，他看到右手边一片枝繁叶茂的小树林仿佛正在招手呼唤他。他随即走进这片树林，这里的凉爽和绿意几乎令人难以抗拒。当然，他并没有忘记前方行程，眼前一条狭窄的小径，路边点缀着鲜花，和他要去的方向大致不差。他倍感欣喜，通过这条美丽的小径，他完全可以将工作和愉悦结合在一起，既能达到目的，又无需经历辛劳痛苦。</p></li>
<li><p>于是，他又兴致盎然地迈步前行。有时，他会被鸟儿们的鸣啾声吸引驻足，烈日的暑气将它们都聚集到树荫里；有时，他会弯腰采摘路边的花朵，或是枝头上荡悠的野果，怡然自得。末了，这条翠绿的小径从此处径直往下延伸，蜿蜒在山岭和灌木丛间，一路有溪水凉爽叮咚，隐约还能听见瀑布潺潺的声音。</p></li>
<li><p>奥拜德在这里停下脚步，思忖着离开那条已知的大路是否安全，但转念一想，此刻阳光炙热灼人，而大路上尘土飞扬，崎岖不平，他还是决心沿着这条新发现的小径往前走。他想，也许会绕几个弯，但最终总会拐回大路上来。</p></li>
<li><p>想到这里，他不再焦虑，重新迈开步伐，虽然心里仍隐隐有些担心，不知道这条小径是否真的能拐回到大路上。心中的忐忑不安，使他仔细打量周边的景物，沉溺于这些能令他放松心情或转移注意力的感官享受。他仔细倾听每一个回声，攀爬每一座山丘来查看方位。他朝着每个瀑布的方向走去，然后跟着静静流淌的溪流向前走，它盘旋着穿过树林，浇灌到一片很大的区域，又延伸出无数的分支。</p></li>
<li><p>在这些趣味盎然的漫步中，时间已经无声无息地流逝了。他已经记不清自己绕了多少个弯，也已经不知道该往哪个方向走。他木木地站在那里，陷入了迷惘，不敢继续往前迈步，生怕再走错了路；但他又很清楚，已经没有时间再闲逛了。正当他百般纠结的时候，天空布满了乌云，天色旋即黯淡下来，一团突如其来的暴雨云团在他头顶急遽积聚起来。</p></li>
<li><p>现在，眼前的危险处境已经令他彻底清醒，他痛苦地回想起自己的愚蠢。他已经看到，幸福在他拈轻怕重的时候悄然失去；他痛悔着当时的怯懦和缺乏耐心，以至于在树林间寻求庇荫；他鄙弃着自己一路上微不足道的好奇心，令他走进一条又一条的小路。正当他后悔不迭之时，天色越来越黑，一道霹雳闪电打断了他的思路。</p></li>
<li><p>他决定用仅存体力沿原路返回，并试着找到树林通往平原的出口。他俯伏在地面上向神祈祷，将自己的生命放在神的手中。当重新站起来的时候，他充满自信，内心格外安宁，他拔出军刀，紧紧抓在手里。树林间的野兽已经开始活动，嘶吼声从四面八方传来，夹杂着愤怒、恐惧、狂暴和死亡的气息。对黑暗的恐惧和孤独包围了他，风呼啸着穿过树林，激流从山峰上湍急而下。</p></li>
<li><p>就这样，他孤独而又紧张地在树林间跌跌撞撞地前行，丝毫不知道自己走往何方，亦不知每时每刻是在接近安全还是死亡。终于，辛劳，而不是恐惧，征服了他。他的呼吸短促沉重，膝盖颤抖着，几乎快要瘫倒在地，屈服于自己的命运。就在这时，透过眼前的荆棘，他突然看到一道锥形光亮。他朝着那光的方向走去，发现那道光是从一间隐居者的小屋里发出的。他怯怯地叫了门，得到许可后进入屋里。屋里老人将自己的食物摆在他面前，奥拜德忙不迭地吃了起来，满心感激难以表述。</p></li>
<li><p>奥拜德吃完饭后，那位隐居的老人问道：“告诉我，你怎么来到这里的？二十多年来，我一个人住在这片渺无人烟的荒野里，还从未见到过一个人。”于是，奥拜德将自己旅途中的经历详细告诉了老人，没有丝毫的隐瞒或辩解。</p></li>
<li><p>“孩子，”隐居的老人说道，“就让今天这些错误和愚蠢、危险和逃脱，深深沉入你心底吧。请记住，我的孩子，人的生命就像是一天的旅程。我们在青春的早晨起床，充满活力，满怀期待；然后，带着高昂的情绪和热切希望，我们踏上人生征途，步履轻快，勤劳奋发，心怀虔诚地走在那条笔直的阳光大道上，朝着天国的方向。没过多久，我们的炽烈热情便退却了，开始试图找到可以减轻我们职责的方法，一些更为简单可抵达同样目的的途径。</p></li>
<li><p>“接着，我们的斗志开始松懈，告诉自己罪恶离我们很遥远，无需惧怕，并决心依靠自己的坚定，来试着靠近我们曾坚决永远不去触及的事物。就这样，我们进入安逸的凉亭，在自以为安全的阴凉地带休息。渐渐的，我们的心在安乐享受中变得柔软，警惕性随之减退。然后，我们开始自问，为什么不能往前再多走一步？为什么我们不能将目光停留在这充满愉悦的花园里？于是，我们带着忧虑和迟疑，靠近这座花园；然后，胆怯地、颤抖着走进它，内心却仍然希望能通过这座花园，又不丧失自己内心的美德。这条美德之路，我们一直将它放在心里，也希望能最终返回。</p></li>
<li><p>“但是，诱惑接踵而来，满足了一个，就忍不住想满足第二个。渐渐的，我们失去了纯真的快乐，用肉欲上的满足来抚慰自己的不安。最后，我们抛却了最初的目标，丧失了理性思考的能力。我们在金钱中挣扎，在奢华中沉迷，在软弱意志的迷宫中反复徘徊；直到风烛残年，黑暗开始侵蚀我们，我们忧心忡忡，疾病缠身。到那个时候，我们回想过去的一生，心中充满惊恐、悲伤和悔恨。到那时，我们只希望——往往是徒劳地希望，我们从没有背弃过那条美德之路。</p></li>
<li><p>“我的孩子，那些能从你的经历中获得教训的人，是幸福的。不要绝望，但你应该记住：虽然错误已经铸成，辛劳也已经付出，但是，你仍然可以做出努力。改变，永远不会太迟，真诚的努力也绝不会空手而归。一个流浪者，在犯下种种错误之后，仍然可以浪子回头。一个在自身错误中探求力量和勇气的人，艰难险阻会在他面前退让。现在，去吧，我的孩子，去好好休息一下，将自己交予全能的上帝眷顾；当晨钟呼唤你再度踏上辛劳的征途，不妨开始你全新的生命与崭新的旅程吧。”</p></li>

with his parents to Illinois while yet an infant. There he passed his
boyhood, being educated at home by his parents. In 1849 the family again
removed to Strawberry Farms, Monmouth County, N.J. When eighteen years
old he began to study painting, but soon gave up the art and devoted
himself to literature. He became a journalist of New York City, and his
productions include almost every variety of writings found in the
literary magazines. After his death, two volumes of his poems, “Drift: a
Seashore Idyl,” and “Poems, Grave and Gay,” were edited by Mr. William
Winter.</p>

<li>I must away to the wooded hills and vales,</li>

<p>THE BIBLE THE BEST OF CLASSICS</p>
<p>《圣经》——最好的经典</p>
<p>Thomas S. Grimke (b. 1786, d. 1834). This eminent lawyer and scholar
was born in Charleston, S.C. He graduated at Yale College [1] in 1807.
He gained considerable reputation as a politician, but is best known as
an advocate of peace, Sunday schools, and the Bible. He was a man of
deep feeling, earnest purpose, and pure life.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is a classic [2] the best the world has ever seen, the
noblest that has ever honored and dignified the language of mortals. If
we look into its antiquity, we discover a title to our veneration
unrivaled in the history of literature. If we have respect to its
evidences, they are found in the testimony of miracle and prophecy; in
the ministry of man, of nature, and of angels, yea, even of “God,
manifest in the flesh,” of “God blessed forever.”</p></li>
<li><p>If we consider its authenticity [3] , no other pages have
survived the lapse of time that can be compared with it. If we examine
its authority, for it speaks as never man spake, we discover that it
came from heaven in vision and prophecy under the sanction [4] of Him
who is Creator of all things, and the Giver of every good and perfect
gift.</p></li>
<li><p>If we reflect on its truths, they are lovely and spotless,
sublime and holy as God himself, unchangeable as his nature, durable as
his righteous dominion, and versatile [5] as the moral condition of
mankind. If we regard the value of its treasures, we must estimate them,
not like the relics of classic antiquity, by the perishable glory and
beauty, virtue and happiness, of this world, but by the enduring
perfection and supreme felicity of an eternal kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>If we inquire who are the men that have recorded its truths,
vindicated [6] its rights, and illustrated the excellence of its scheme,
from the depth of ages and from the living world, from the populous
continent and the isles of the sea, comes forth the answer: “The
patriarch and the prophet, the evangelist [7] and the martyr.”</p></li>
<li><p>If we look abroad through the world of men, the victims of folly
or vice, the prey of cruelty, of injustice, and inquire what are its
benefits, even in this temporal state, the great and the humble, the
rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, the learned and the
ignorant reply, as with one voice, that humility and resignation,
purity, order, and peace, faith, hope, and charity are its blessings
upon earth.</p></li>
<li><p>And if, raising our eyes from time to eternity; from the world of
mortals to the world of just men made perfect; from the visible
creation, marvelous, beautiful, and glorious as it is, to the invisible
creation of angels and seraphs [8] ; from the footstool of God to the
throne of God himself, we ask, what are the blessings that flow from
this single volume, let the question be answered by the pen of the
evangelist, the harp of the prophet, and the records of the book of
life.</p></li>
<li><p>Such is the best of classics the world has ever admired; such,
the noblest that man has ever adopted as a guide.</p></li>

1807年，毕业于耶鲁学院。他以政治家的身份获得了广泛的知名度，但人们更熟知的是他积极倡导和平、主张日学并弘扬《圣经》。他情感深厚，意愿真切，是一个纯粹而高尚的人。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>这是世上所曾见过的最伟大的杰作，这是有史以来用人类语言所表达出的最高贵、最庄严的文字。如果我们审视它的古老，我们会发现，在人类文学史上还从未有过一本书得到的尊重能与它媲美。如果我们检视它的可靠性，这也已经在大量的神迹和预言中，在对人类、对自然、对天使所行的事中，是的，甚至是在“神，在肉身显现”、“上帝，赐福永远”当中，得到证实。</p></li>
<li><p>如果我们验证它的真实性，我们会看到，除此之外没有任何一本书曾经历过这么漫长的时间考验而留存下来。如果我们查核它的权威性，因它上面所说的话，是任何人都不曾说过的，我们会发现，这些话来自对天国的愿景，以及上帝所认可的预言。上帝是这世间万物的造物主，是所有仁爱善行和美好礼物的馈赠者。</p></li>
<li><p>如果我们反思《圣经》的真理，它们如此可爱，纯净无瑕，崇高圣洁，正如上帝本身；它们像上帝的大爱一样永不改变，像他公正的统治一样永续持久，又像人类的道德状况一样复杂多变。如果我们要衡量《圣经》中所蕴藏财富的价值，我们不能像对待一件古董遗迹似的，用这世上那些易衰败的荣耀、美丽、美德或快乐去估量它，而必须用那永恒天国中永续的完美和至高无上的完满去估量它。</p></li>
<li><p>如果我们要探询究竟是谁记录下《圣经》里的故事、验证过它的确实、阐释过它的崇高主题——从源远流长的历史到凡世红尘的现世，从人口稠密的大陆到海上的孤岛，所及之处的答案向我们昭示：“上帝是世界创始人与预言者，人类福音的传道者及殉道人。”</p></li>
<li><p>如果我们纵览整个人类世界，目睹那些愚行或恶习的受害者，残虐暴行或非正义的牺牲者，然后问问他们，即使是在这短暂的现世中，《圣经》给我们带来了什么？所有人——伟大抑或谦卑者，富人抑或穷人，强壮的和软弱的，饱学之士抑或无知之徒，他们都会异口同声地说：谦卑、顺服、纯洁、守序、平和、信仰、希望以及善行皆为《圣经》所赐给世人的福音。</p></li>
<li><p>如果我们将视线从现世转向永恒，从这易朽坏的凡俗世间，转向那公义者所在的完美天国；从这眼睛能见着的造物，不管它们有多奇妙、多美丽、多荣耀，转向那看不见的天使和大天使；从上帝的脚凳，转向他的宝座本身——我们要问，从这人类唯一卷帙浩繁的《圣经》中流传出来的福音究竟是什么？不妨追溯传道士手中的蘸笔，先知吟唱的竖琴，以及这本人类生命大书上的誊撰记录，答案自会揭晓。</p></li>
<li><p>这，便是这个世界迄今为止高山仰止的古典精粹；这，便是人类用来作为指引的最高贵著作。</p></li>

<p>ANECDOTE OF THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE</p>
<p>纽卡斯尔公爵 (1) 轶事</p>
<p>A laughable story was circulated during the administration of the old
Duke of Newcastle, and retailed to the public in various forms. This
nobleman, with many good points, was remarkable for being profuse of his
promises on all occasions, and valued himself particularly on being able
to anticipate the words or the wants of the various persons who attended
his levees, before they uttered a word. This sometimes led him into
ridiculous embarrassment; and it was this proneness to lavish promises,
which gave occasion for the following anecdote:</p>
<p>At the election of a certain borough in Cornwall, where the opposite
interests were almost equally poised, a single vote was of the highest
importance. This object the Duke, by well applied argument and personal
application, at length attained; and the gentleman he recommended,
gained the election. In the warmth of gratitude, his grace poured forth
acknowledgments and promises without ceasing, on the fortunate possessor
of the casting vote; called him his best and dearest friend; protested,
that he should consider himself as forever indebted to him; and that he
would serve him by night or by day.</p>
<p>The Cornish voter, who was an honest fellow, and would not have
thought himself entitled to any reward, but for such a torrent of
acknowledgments, thanked the Duke for his kindness, and told him the
supervisor of excise was old and infirm, and, if he would have the
goodness to recommend his son-in-law to the commissioners, in case of
the old man’s death, he should think himself and his family bound to
render his grace every assistance in their power, on any future
occasion.</p>
<p>“My dear friend, why do you ask for such a trifling employment?”
exclaimed his grace; “your relative shall have it the moment the place
is vacant, if you will but call my attention to it.”</p>
<p>“But how shall I get admitted to you, my lord? For in London, I
understand, it is a very difficult business to get a sight of you great
folks, though you are so kind and complaisant to us in the country.”</p>
<p>“The instant the man dies,” replied the Duke, “set out posthaste for
London; drive directly to my house, and, be it by night or by day,
thunder at the door; I will leave word with my porter to show you
upstairs directly; and the employment shall be disposed of according to
your wishes.”</p>
<p>The parties separated; the Duke drove to a friend’s house in the
neighborhood, without a wish or desire to see his new acquaintance till
that day seven years; but the memory of the Cornish elector, not being
burdened with such a variety of objects, was more retentive. The
supervisor died a few months after, and the Duke’s humble friend,
relying on the word of a peer, was conveyed to London posthaste, and
ascended with alacrity the steps of that nobleman’s palace.</p>
<p>The reader should be informed, that just at this time, no less a
person than the King of Spain was expected hourly to depart this life,
an event in which the minister of Great Britain was particularly
concerned; and the Duke of Newcastle, on the very night that the
proprietor of the decisive vote arrived at his door, had sat up
anxiously expecting dispatches from Madrid. Wearied by official business
and agitated spirits, he retired to rest, having previously given
particular instructions to his porter not to go to bed, as he expected
every minute a messenger with advices of the greatest importance, and
desired that he might be shown upstairs, the moment of his arrival.</p>
<p>His grace was sound asleep; and the porter, settled for the night in
his armchair, had already commenced a sonorous nap, when the vigorous
arm of the Cornish voter roused him from his slumbers. To his first
question, “Is the Duke at home?” the porter replied, “Yes, and in bed;
but has left particular orders that, come when you will, you are to go
up to him directly.”</p>
<p>“Bless him, for a worthy and honest gentleman,” cried our applicant
for the vacant post, smiling and nodding with approbation at the prime
minister’s kindness, “how punctual his grace is; I knew he would not
deceive me; let me hear no more of lords and dukes not keeping their
words; I verily believe they are as honest, and mean as well as any
other folks.” Having ascended the stairs as he was speaking, he was
ushered into the Duke’s bedchamber.</p>
<p>“Is he dead?” exclaimed his grace, rubbing his eyes, and scarcely
awakened from dreaming of the King of Spain, “Is he dead?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord,” replied the eager expectant, delighted to find the
election promise, with all its circumstances, so fresh in the nobleman’s
memory.</p>
<p>“When did he die?”</p>
<p>“The day before yesterday, exactly at half past one o’clock, after
being confined three weeks to his bed, and taking a power of doctor’s
stuff; and I hope your grace will be as good as your word, and let my
son-in-law succeed him.”</p>
<p>The Duke, by this time perfectly awake, was staggered at the
impossibility of receiving intelligence from Madrid in so short a space
of time; and perplexed at the absurdity of a king’s messenger applying
for his son-in-law to succeed the King of Spain: “Is the man drunk, or
mad? Where are your dispatches?” exclaimed his grace, hastily drawing
back his curtain; where, instead of a royal courier, he recognized at
the bedside, the fat, good-humored countenance of his friend from
Cornwall, making low bows, with hat in hand, and “hoping my lord would
not forget the gracious promise he was so good as to make, in favor of
his son-in-law, at the last election.”</p>
<p>Vexed at so untimely a disturbance, and disappointed of news from
Spain, the Duke frowned for a moment; but chagrin soon gave way to
mirth, at so singular and ridiculous a combination of circumstances,
and, yielding to the impulse, he sunk upon the bed in a violent fit of
laughter, which was communicated in a moment to the attendants.</p>
<p>The relater of this little narrative, concludes, with observing,
“Although the Duke of Newcastle could not place the relative of his old
acquaintance on the throne of His Catholic Majesty, he advanced him to a
post not less honorable—he made him an exciseman.”</p>

<p>在纽卡斯尔老公爵施政期间，流传着一个让人捧腹的故事，在众人口耳相传之下有多个版本。这位贵族的优点数不尽数，他的突出优点是擅长夸口许诺，且不分何时何地——无论三教九流有事来求他，不等他们开口，他就能道出他们的心里话，满足他们的需要，对此他也特别引以为傲。这么做有时会让他陷入荒唐可笑、进退两难的境地，正是这种到处许诺的嗜好，才引出了如下这桩轶事：</p>
<p>康沃尔郡某个自治区选举，竞选的两派所得票数不相上下，到了一票定胜负的关键时刻。公爵通过滔滔不绝的雄辩，私底下又做了许多工作，终于争取到这一票；而他所力荐的年轻人赢得了这次选举。公爵满怀感激之情，对这个投出最后一票的幸运者不停地致谢，信誓旦旦地许诺，称他为自己最亲近的朋友。公爵声称从此以后都认为自己对他有所亏欠，无论日夜都愿为他效劳。</p>
<p>康沃尔郡的这个投票者是个老实人，他本来不觉得自己应为此获得什么奖赏，但在公爵如洪水般倾泻的致谢辞中，他回谢了公爵的好意，并告诉公爵税务官年事已高，身体虚弱；万一这老家伙故去，若公爵能大发善心推荐他的女婿替任，那么他和他的家人将来一定会不遗余力地报答他的恩情。</p>
<p>“我亲爱的朋友，你为什么想要谋得这么卑微的差事呢？”公爵大人惊叫道：“这个职位一空出来，保管就是你亲戚的了。只要你到时候跟我说一声。”</p>
<p>“但尊敬的阁下，我怎么才能见到您呢？我知道，虽然在乡下您对我们都非常友善亲切，但在伦敦，要见到您这样的大人物可是难上加难啊。”</p>
<p>“那人一死，”公爵答道：“你就立马前往伦敦，直接让马车来到我家，不管白天黑夜，你只管用力敲门。我会留话给我的门房，让他直接把你带到楼上，这个职位自会如你所愿地安排好。”</p>
<p>两人就此分别；公爵乘马车去了附近的一位朋友家。此后七年，他从未想起来要去看看这位新相识。但康沃尔郡的选举人尽管诸事繁杂，记性可是真不赖。数月后那位税务官去世，公爵这位谦卑的朋友谨记着公爵阁下的话，火速赶往伦敦，飞快地来到了大人的宅邸门前。</p>
<p>此处要告知诸位读者：就在此时，西班牙国王已经奄奄一息，随时即可驾鹤西去，这是大不列颠的大臣最为关心的事情。就在那个曾投下关键一票的选举人来到纽卡斯尔公爵门前的那个夜晚，公爵正焦急地等待着来自马德里的急件。他公事繁忙，加上心情焦虑，此刻已是疲惫不堪，于是便回房休息。休息前他特别交代门房不要睡觉，因为有一位携带极重要信息的信使随时会到，他一直在等着。他嘱咐说信使一到就叫他上楼。</p>
<p>公爵阁下睡熟了，门房这一夜就坐在他的靠椅里，他也开始打盹了，发出响亮的呼噜声，此时康沃尔郡的选举人用强壮的胳膊把他摇醒了。劈头盖脸就是一个问题：“公爵在家吗？”门房回答：“是的，他在睡觉。但他特别交代我说，你来到时就直接过去找他。”</p>
<p>“上帝保佑他，他真是个诚实的绅士、真正的绅士！”首相大人的仁慈体贴，让这个前来谋求职位的人笑了，赞许地点点头：“大人是多么守信啊！我就知道他不会骗我，人们总说勋爵和公爵的诺言如同儿戏，这种话我再也不要听了。我坚信他们是诚实的，他们和其他人一样言出必行。”他边说边走上楼去，门房把他带到公爵的卧室里。</p>
<p>“他死了吗？”公爵大人正梦见西班牙国王呢，他边揉着眼边喊道，还未完全清醒过来：“他死了吗？”</p>
<p>“是的，大人。”这位满心急切的期待者回答他，他高兴地发现，对选举时许下的承诺，公爵大人可是全部记得一清二楚。</p>
<p>“他什么时候死的？”</p>
<p>“前天，确切时间是1点半。他之前已卧床不起三个星期，吃了好些医生开的药。我希望大人能兑现诺言，让我的女婿接任他的职位。”</p>
<p>此时公爵已完全清醒过来，这么短的时间就收到了来自马德里的消息，他感到很吃惊；而国王的信使竟请求让自己的女婿接任西班牙国王，这种荒唐事让他脑子也糊涂了：“这人是醉了还是疯了？你的信件在哪里？”公爵大人喊道，他急匆匆地拉起帘子，认出了床边站的并非是皇家信使，而是一张胖胖的、表情愉悦的脸——分明是他来自康沃尔郡的老朋友，正深深地鞠着躬，手里捧着帽子说：“希望大人不要忘了当初好意许下的慷慨诺言——您上次选举时说要照顾我的女婿。”</p>
<p>对这个如此不合时宜的打扰，公爵不禁皱起了眉头，也对西班牙还未传来消息感到失望。但在这个奇特而荒谬的巧合面前，他的不快马上就被欢乐冲散，不禁倒在床上哈哈大笑起来，他的随从于是也受到感染齐声大笑起来。</p>
<p>讲述这个故事的人最后发了一通议论，总结道：“尽管纽卡斯尔公爵无法将老相熟的亲戚送上天主教国王的宝座，他还是把那人擢升到了一个不失尊贵的职位上——那人当上了税务官。”</p>

<p>DAWN</p>
<p>黎明</p>
<p>Edward Everett, 1794-1865. He was born at Dorchester, Mass., now a
part of Boston, and graduated from Harvard College with the highest
honors of his class, at the age of seventeen. While yet in college, he
had quite a reputation as a brilliant writer. Before he was twenty years
of age, he was settled as pastor over the Brattle Street Church, in
Boston, and at once became famous as an eloquent preacher. In 1814, he
was elected Professor of Greek Literature in his Alma Mater; and, in
order to prepare himself for the duties of his office, he entered on an
extended course of travel in Europe. He edited the “North American
Review,” in addition to the labors of his professorship, after he
returned to America.</p>
<p>In 1825, Mr. Everett was elected to Congress, and held his seat in
the House for ten years. He was Governor of his native state from 1835
to 1839. In 1841, he was appointed Minister to England. On his return,
in 1846, he was chosen President of Harvard University, and held the
office for three years. In 1852, he was appointed Secretary of State.
February 22, 1856, he delivered, in Boston, his celebrated lecture on
Washington. This lecture was afterwards delivered in most of the
principal cities and towns in the United States. The proceeds were
devoted to the purchase of Mt. Vernon. In 1860, he was a candidate for
the Vice Presidency of the United States, He is celebrated as an elegant
and forcible writer, and a chaste orator.</p>
<p>This extract, a wonderful piece of word painting, is a portion of an
address on the “Uses of Astronomy,” delivered at the inauguration of the
Dudley Observatory, at Albany, N, Y, Note the careful use of words, and
the strong figures in the third and fourth paragraphs.</p>
<p>I had occasion, a few weeks since, to take the early train from
Providence to Boston; and for this purpose rose at two o’clock in the
morning. Everything around was wrapped in darkness and hushed in
silence, broken only by what seemed at that hour the unearthly clank and
rush of the train. It was a mild, serene, midsummer’s night,—the sky was
without a cloud, the winds were whist. The moon, then in the last
quarter, had just risen, and the stars shone with a spectral luster but
little affected by her presence.</p>
<p>Jupiter, two hours high, was the herald of the day; the Pleiades,
just above the horizon, shed their sweet influence in the east; Lyra
sparkled near the zenith; Andromeda veiled her newly-discovered glories
from the naked eye in the south; the steady Pointers, far beneath the
pole, looked meekly up from the depths of the north to their
sovereign.</p>
<p>Such was the glorious spectacle as I entered the train. As we
proceeded, the timid approach of twilight became more perceptible; the
intense blue of the sky began to soften; the smaller stars, like little
children, went first to rest; the sister beams of the Pleiades soon
melted together; but the bright constellations of the west and north
remained unchanged. Steadily the wondrous transfiguration went on. Hands
of angels, hidden from mortal eyes, shifted the scenery of the heavens;
the glories of night dissolved into the glories of the dawn.</p>
<p>The blue sky now turned more softly gray; the great watch stars shut
up their holy eyes; the east began to kindle. Faint streaks of purple
soon blushed along the sky; the whole celestial concave was filled with
the inflowing tides of the morning light, which came pouring down from
above in one great ocean of radiance; till at length, as we reached the
Blue Hills, a flash of purple fire blazed out from above the horizon,
and turned the dewy teardrops of flower and leaf into rubies and
diamonds. In a few seconds, the everlasting gates of the morning were
thrown wide open, and the lord of day, arrayed in glories too severe for
the gaze of man, began his state.</p>
<p>I do not wonder at the superstition of the ancient Magians, who, in
the morning of the world, went up to the hilltops of Central Asia, and,
ignorant of the true God, adored the most glorious work of his hand. But
I am filled with amazement, when I am told, that, in this enlightened
age and in the heart of the Christian world, there are persons who can
witness this daily manifestation of the power and wisdom of the Creator,
and yet say in their hearts, “There is no God.”</p>

<p>几周以前，我有机会乘坐早班火车从普罗维登斯去波士顿，为此要在凌晨两点起床。周围的一切都包裹在黑暗沉寂之中，只有火车忽然启动向前驶去时，那神秘的轰隆声才会打破这静谧。这是个温暖宁静的仲夏夜，万里无云，微风轻抚。那时下弦月刚刚升起，星星在她面前并不逊色，仍然闪烁着，散发出幽魂般的光芒。</p>
<p>木星悬挂在天边已经两个钟头了，预示黎明将至；昴宿星刚刚从地平线上升起，在东方挥洒着它们恬静的光芒；天琴座在天顶附近闪烁；南方的仙女座在肉眼的注视下半遮半掩着它的光辉；两颗指极星一如既往地闪耀，远远地在北极点之下向北方望去，指向北极星——它们的君王。</p>
<p>这正是我登上火车时所看到的奇美之景。随着火车前行，羞涩展露的微光渐明，天穹的深蓝开始变得柔和；小星星们就如同孩童一般，先回去睡觉了。七星姐妹的光芒很快模糊成一片；但西方和北方那些明亮的恒星仍然高高悬挂。星云继续奇妙的变幻。天使的双手躲开凡人的眼睛，变化着天国的景色。夜晚的光华消融在黎明的曙光中。</p>
<p>蓝色的天幕现在渐变成柔和的灰白；大大的守夜星们合上了神圣的双眼。东方开始天色发亮。一抹抹淡淡的紫红很快染红了天际。晨光如潮水般满溢了整个天国的苍穹，它们从天上喷涌而出，汇成一个无边的光之海洋。最后，当我们抵达特克斯和凯斯特群岛时，一束紫红的火焰在地平线之上熊熊燃烧，把繁花绿叶上纯洁的泪珠映照成红宝石和闪钻。顷刻间，永恒的清晨之门一扇扇赫然洞开，白日的主宰开始出场，它射出光芒万丈，让人无法直视。</p>
<p>古波斯的教徒在世间清晨登上中亚的高山之巅，无视真正的上帝，却顶礼膜拜上帝之手所创造的光辉璀璨之景；这并不令我感到惊奇。但让我诧异无比的是：人们告诉我，在这启蒙时代，基督教世界的中心，有人亲眼目睹着造物主力量和智慧的日日展示，却发自内心地说：“世上根本就没有上帝。”</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF A STORM</p>
<p>风暴之歌</p>
<p>Benjamin Disraeli. 1805-1881, was of Jewish descent. His ancestors
were driven out of Spain by the Inquisition, and went to Venice. In
1748, his grandfather came to England. His father was Isaac Disraeli,
well known as a literary man. Benjamin was born in London, and received
his early education under his father. He afterwards studied for a
lawyer, but soon gave up his profession for literature. His first novel,
“Vivian Grey,” appeared when the author was twenty-one years of age; it
received much attention. After several defeats he succeeded in an
election to Parliament, and took his seat in that body, in the first
year of Victoria’s reign. On his first attempt to speak in Parliament,
the House refused to hear him. It is said that, as he sat down, he
remarked that the time would come when they would hear him. In 1849, he
became the leader of the Conservative party in the House. During the
administration of W. E. Gladstone, Mr. Disraeli was leader of the
opposition. In 1868, he became prime minister, holding the office for a
short time. In 1874, he was again appointed to the same office, where he
remained until 1880. His wife was made Viscountess of Beaconsfield in
1868. After her death, the title of Earl of Beaconsfield was conferred
on Disraeli. He ranked among the most eminent, statesmen of the age, but
always devoted a portion of his time to literature. “Lothair,” a novel,
was published in 1870.</p>
<p>They looked round on every side, and hope gave way before the scene
of desolation. Immense branches were shivered from the largest trees;
small ones were entirely stripped of their leaves; the long grass was
bowed to the earth; the waters were whirled in eddies out of the little
rivulets; birds, leaving their nests to seek shelter in the crevices of
the rocks, unable to stem the driving air, flapped their wings and fell
upon the earth; the frightened animals of the plain, almost suffocated
by the impetuosity of the wind, sought safety and found destruction;
some of the largest trees were torn up by the roots; the sluices of the
mountains were filled, and innumerable torrents rushed down the before
empty gullies. The heavens now open, and the lightning and thunder
contend with the horrors of the wind.</p>
<p>In a moment, all was again hushed. Dead silence succeeded the bellow
of the thunder, the roar of the wind, the rush of the waters, the
moaning of the beasts, the screaming of the birds. Nothing was heard
save the plash of the agitated lake, as it beat up against the black
rocks which girt it in.</p>
<p>Again, greater darkness enveloped the trembling earth. Anon, the
heavens were rent with lightning, which nothing could have quenched but
the descending deluge. Cataracts poured down from the lowering
firmament. For an instant, the horses dashed madly forward; beast and
rider blinded and stifled by the gushing rain, and gasping for breath.
Shelter was nowhere. The quivering beasts reared, and snorted, and sank
upon their knees, dismounting their riders.</p>
<p>He had scarcely spoken, when there burst forth a terrific noise, they
knew not what; a rush, they could not understand; a vibration which
shook them on their horses. Every terror sank before the roar of the
cataract. It seemed that the mighty mountain, unable to support its
weight of waters, shook to the foundation. A lake had burst upon its
summit, and the cataract became a falling ocean. The source of the great
deep appeared to be discharging itself over the range of mountains; the
great gray peak tottered on its foundation!—It shook!—it fell! and
buried in its ruins the castle, the village, and the bridge!</p>

<p>它们环顾四处，希望在这一片荒芜之地找到退路。就连最粗壮的树上那繁茂的枝叶也在抖动，而小树的叶子已落得一干二净，高高的野草弯腰贴地；小溪里的溪水打着漩涡溢出，小鸟们离开了巢穴，到石缝里寻找栖身之处，无法顶着强劲的大风飞行，扑打着翅膀跌倒在地。草原上受惊的动物们在这猛烈的风中几乎无法喘气，它们找寻着安全的容身之所，却发现到处都是一片狼藉。林间有些最粗壮的树木连根拔起，山上的蓄水满溢，无数洪流沿着原本干涸的沟壑滚滚而下。天空开裂，电闪雷鸣与狂暴骇人的大风斗得难解难分。</p>
<p>过了一会儿，一切又安静下来。雷霆怒吼，烈风咆哮，洪流滚滚，野兽呼号，小鸟尖叫——紧接着是死一样的沉寂。听不见任何的声音，只有湖水翻腾，撞击着四周的黑乎乎的岩石哗哗作响。</p>
<p>更浓稠的黑暗再次笼罩了颤抖的大地。顷刻间，闪电撕破苍穹，威力无穷，只有倾泻如注的大雨才能与之匹敌。瀑布般的水流从阴沉的天空中奔涌而下。一时间马儿发疯一般向前猛冲，这些马儿和它们的骑手都让这滂沱大雨迷住了眼睛、扼住了喉咙，只得大口地喘气呼吸。无处藏身。浑身战栗的马儿们后腿直立，打着响鼻，膝盖打了弯，把骑手掀下马来。</p>
<p>他一直保持沉默，此时爆发了一阵可怕的巨响，人们并不知道是怎么回事。洪水气势汹汹，他们猝不及防；忽然地动山摇，他们在马背上惊得目瞪口呆。在大瀑布的怒吼面前，每个人心里都充满了恐惧。似乎那巍峨的群山再也无法承受水流的重量，整个摇晃起来。高涨的湖水终于泛滥而出，瀑布成了倾倒的海洋。最深处的水源仿佛漫流在群山之间，那灰白的巨峰也摇摇欲坠起来！它晃着！它倒了！山崩地裂，城堡、山村和桥梁都夷为平地了！</p>

<p>AFTER THE THUNDERSTORM</p>
<p>暴雨过后</p>
<p>James Thomson, 1700-1748, the son of a clergyman, was born in
Scotland. He studied at the University of Edinburgh, and intended to
follow the profession of his father, but never entered upon the duties
of the sacred office. In 1724 he went to London, where he spent most of
his subsequent life. He had shown some poetical talent when it boy; and,
in 1826, he published “Winter,” a part of a longer poem, entitled “The
Seasons,” the best known of all his works. He also wrote several plays
for the stage; none of them, however, achieved any great success. In the
last year of his life, he published his “Castle of Indolence,” the most
famous of his works excepting “The Seasons.” Thomson was heavy and dull
in his personal appearance, and was indolent in his habits. The moral
tone of his writings is always good. This extract is from “The
Seasons.”</p>
<p>As from the face of heaven the shattered clouds</p>

<p>Invests the fields; and nature smiles revived.</p>
<p>’T is beauty all, and grateful song around,</p>
<p>Joined to the low of kine, and numerous bleat</p>
<p>Of flocks thick-nibbling through the clovered vale:</p>
<p>And shall the hymn be marred by thankless man,</p>
<p>Most favored; who, with voice articulate,</p>
<p>Should lead the chorus of this lower world?</p>
<p>Shall man, so soon forgetful of the Hand</p>
<p>That hushed the thunder, and serenes the sky,</p>

<p>HOUSE CLEANING</p>
<p>清扫家居</p>
<p>Francis Hopkinson, 1737-1791. He was the son of an Englishman; born
in Philadelphia, and was educated at the college of that city, now the
University of Pennsylvania. He represented New Jersey in the Congress of
1776, and was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He
was one of the most sensible and elegant writers of his time, and
distinguished himself both in prose and verse. His lighter writings
abound in humor and keen satire; his more solid writings are marked by
clearness and good sense. His pen did much to forward the cause of
American independence. His “Essay on Whitewashing,” from which the
following extract is taken, was mistaken for the composition of
Dr. Franklin, and published among his writings, It was originally in the
form of “A Letter from a Gentleman in America to his Friend in Europe,
on Whitewashing.”</p>
<p>There is no season of the year in which the lady may not, if she
pleases, claim her privilege; but the latter end of May is generally
fixed upon for the purpose. The attentive husband may judge, by certain
prognostics, when the storm is at hand. If the lady grows uncommonly
fretful, finds fault with the servants, is discontented with the
children, and complains much of the nastiness of everything about her,
these are symptoms which ought not to be neglected, yet they sometimes
go off without any further effect.</p>
<p>But if, when the husband rises in the morning, he should observe in
the yard a wheelbarrow with a quantity of lime in it, or should see
certain buckets filled with a solution of lime in water, there is no
time for hesitation. He immediately locks up the apartment or closet
where his papers and private property are kept, and, putting the key
into his pocket, betakes himself to flight. A husband, however beloved,
becomes a perfect nuisance during this season of female rage. His
authority is superseded, his commission suspended, and the very scullion
who cleans the brasses in the kitchen becomes of more importance than
he. He has nothing for it but to abdicate for a time, and run from an
evil which he can neither prevent nor mollify.</p>
<p>The husband gone, the ceremony begins. The walls are stripped of
their furniture—paintings, prints, and looking-glasses lie huddled in
heaps about the floors; the curtains are torn from their testers, the
beds crammed into windows, chairs and tables, bedsteads and cradles,
crowd the yard, and the garden fence bends beneath the weight of
carpets, blankets, cloth cloaks, old coats, under petticoats, and ragged
breeches. Here may be seen the lumber of the kitchen, forming a dark and
confused mass for the foreground of the picture; gridirons and frying
pans, rusty shovels and broken tongs, joint stools, and the fractured
remains of rush-bottomed chairs. There a closet has disgorged its
bowels—riveted plates and dishes, halves of china bowls, cracked
tumblers, broken wineglasses, phials of forgotten physic, papers of
unknown powders, seeds and dried herbs, tops of teapots, and stoppers of
departed decanters—from the rag hole in the garret, to the rat hole in
the cellar, no place escapes unrummaged. It would seem as if the day of
general doom had come, and the utensils of the house were dragged forth
to judgment.</p>
<p>In this tempest, the words of King Lear unavoidably present
themselves, and might, with little alteration, be made strictly
applicable.</p>
<p>“Let the great gods,</p>
<p>That keep this dreadful pother o’er our heads,</p>
<p>Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,</p>
<p>That hast within thee undivulged crimes</p>
<p>Unwhipp’d of justice.</p>
<p>Close pent-up guilts,</p>
<p>Rive your concealing continents, and cry</p>
<p>These dreadful summoners grace.”</p>
<p>This ceremony completed, and the house thoroughly evacuated, the next
operation is to smear the walls and ceilings with brushes dipped into a
solution of lime, called whitewash; to pour buckets of water over every
floor; and scratch all the partitions and wainscots with hard brushes,
charged with soft soap and stonecutters’ sand.</p>
<p>The windows by no means escape the general deluge. A servant
scrambles out upon the penthouse, at the risk of her neck, and, with a
mug in her hand and a bucket within reach, dashes innumerable gallons of
water against the glass panes, to the great annoyance of passengers in
the street.</p>
<p>I have been told that an action at law was once brought against one
of these water nymphs, by a person who had a new suit of clothes spoiled
by this operation: but after long argument, it was determined that no
damages could be awarded; inasmuch as the defendant was in the exercise
of a legal right, and not answerable for the consequences. And so the
poor gentleman was doubly non-suited; for he lost both his suit of
clothes and his suit at law.</p>
<p>These smearings and scratchings, these washings and dashings, being
duly performed, the next ceremonial is to cleanse and replace the
distracted furniture. You may have seen a house raising, or a ship
launch—recollect, if you can, the hurry, bustle, confusion, and noise of
such a scene, and you will have some idea of this cleansing match. The
misfortune is, that the sole object is to make things clean. It matters
not how many useful, ornamental, or valuable articles suffer mutilation
or death under the operation. A mahogany chair and a carved frame
undergo the same discipline; they are to be made clean at all events;
but their preservation is not worthy of attention.</p>
<p>For instance: a fine large engraving is laid flat upon the floor; a
number of smaller prints are piled upon it, until the superincumbent
weight cracks the lower glass—but this is of no importance. A valuable
picture is placed leaning against the sharp corner of a table; others
are made to lean against that, till the pressure of the whole forces the
corner of the table through the canvas of the first. The frame and glass
of a fine print are to be cleaned; the spirit and oil used on this
occasion are suffered to leak through and deface the engraving—no
matter. If the glass is clean and the frame shines, it is sufficient—the
rest is not worthy of consideration. An able arithmetician hath made a
calculation, founded on long experience, and proved that the losses and
destruction incident to two white washings are equal to one removal, and
three removals equal to one fire.</p>
<p>This cleansing frolic over, matters begin to resume their pristine
appearance: the storm abates, and all would be well again; but it is
impossible that so great a convulsion in so small a community should
pass over without producing some consequences. For two or three weeks
after the operation, the family are usually afflicted with sore eyes,
sore throats, or severe colds, occasioned by exhalations from wet floors
and damp walls.</p>
<p>I know a gentleman here who is fond of accounting for everything in a
philosophical way. He considers this, what I call a custom, as a real
periodical disease peculiar to the climate. His train of reasoning is
whimsical and ingenious, but I am not at leisure to give you the detail.
The result was, that he found the distemper to be incurable; but after
much study, he thought he had discovered a method to divert the evil he
could not subdue. For this purpose, he caused a small building, about
twelve feet square, to be erected in his garden, and furnished with some
ordinary chairs and tables, and a few prints of the cheapest sort. His
hope was, that when the whitewashing frenzy seized the females of his
family, they might repair to this apartment, and scrub, and scour, and
smear to their hearts’ content; and so spend the violence of the disease
in this outpost, whilst he enjoyed himself in quiet at headquarters. But
the experiment did not answer his expectation. It was impossible it
should, since a principal part of the gratification consists in the
lady’s having an uncontrolled right to torment her husband at least once
in every year; to turn him out of doors, and take the reins of
government into her own hands.</p>
<p>There is a much better contrivance than this of the philosopher’s;
which is, to cover the walls of the house with paper. This is generally
done. And though it does not abolish, it at least shortens the period of
female dominion. This paper is decorated with various fancies; and made
so ornamental that the women have admitted the fashion without
perceiving the design.</p>
<p>There is also another alleviation to the husband’s distress. He
generally has the sole use of a small room or closet for his books and
papers, the key of which he is allowed to keep. This is considered as a
privileged place, even in the whitewashing season, and stands like the
land of Goshen amidst the plagues of Egypt. But then he must be
extremely cautious, and ever upon his guard; for, should he
inadvertently go abroad and leave the key in his door, the housemaid,
who is always on the watch for such an opportunity, immediately enters
in triumph with buckets, brooms, and brushes—takes possession of the
premises, and forthwith puts an his books and papers “to rights,” to his
utter confusion, and sometimes serious detriment.</p>

<p>一年中没有哪个季节，女士们会大发善心而不去行使她们的特权；但一般而言，五月末就是她们固定行使权力的日子。警惕的丈夫可要从一些蛛丝马迹中预感风暴来临的时间。要是女主人愈发烦躁，老是挑仆人的毛病，不满孩子的表现，抱怨着所有的一切都肮脏不堪——这些都是不可忽视的征兆，不过有时这些征兆也会莫名地消失，没有引发进一步的举措。</p>
<p>不过，要是丈夫清早起床时发现，院子里停了辆装着许多石灰的手推车，或看到一些盛满石灰水的水桶，那就再也不能有片刻迟疑了。他立刻锁起了放置文件和私房物品的柜子或贮藏室，把钥匙放到口袋里，然后逃之夭夭。无论如何受夫人爱戴，在这个女人大发雷霆的季节，丈夫都不是个眼中钉。他的威严一落千丈，他的职权暂时中止，而那个在厨房里洗着铜碗铜碟的佣人却变得比他还要重要。他无计可施，只能姑且退居二线，面对这桩他既无法阻止、也不能设法减轻的“罪恶”，唯有一走了之。</p>
<p>丈夫走了，清扫仪式开始。墙壁上的装饰一扫而空，油画、印刷品和镜子杂乱地堆在地上；窗帘扯了下来，床快要塞到窗户里去，椅子、桌子、床架和托架把院子里塞得满满的。花园的围栏不堪重负，被堆在上面的地毯、毛巾、斗篷、旧大衣、衬裙和短裤压弯。你可能还会看到厨房里的各式杂物，黑乎乎的一大堆，在这幅图景中，首先跳入你眼帘的是：折凳、烤架和煎锅，锈迹斑斑的锅铲和坏掉的火钳，还有那残缺破烂的灯心草椅垫。那儿有个橱柜已经吐得一干二净：铆钉钉住的盘碟，碎成两半的瓷碗，有裂纹的大玻璃杯子，打碎的葡萄酒杯，不知装了什么药的小瓶，包着不知名粉末的纸张，种子和干草，茶壶盖子，早已扔掉的瓶塞——从阁楼上的破孔，到天花板的老鼠洞，没有地方能幸免于难，全都被翻个底朝天。看起来仿佛是末日审判的那一天已经来临，这屋子里的东西都被拉出来受审。</p>
<p>在这场暴乱之中，李尔王的话语无疑能代表它们的心声，只要稍作改变，大概就再妥帖不过。</p>
<p>掀起这场可怕的骚动，</p>
<p>让他们现在找到他们的敌人吧。</p>
<p>战栗吧，你尚未被人发觉，</p>
<p>逍遥法外的罪人！</p>
<p>躲起来吧，你杀人的凶手，</p>
<p>你用伪善欺人的骗子，</p>
<p>你道貌岸然的逆伦禽兽。</p>
<p>魂飞魄散吧，你用正直的外表</p>
<p>遮掩杀人阴谋的大奸巨恶！</p>
<p>撕下你们包藏祸心的伪装，</p>
<p>显露你们罪恶的原形，</p>
<p>向那些可怕的天使哀号乞命吧！</p>
<p>这个仪式就此完成，房子被打扫一空，第二项工作是用蘸了石灰水的刷子涂抹墙壁和天花板，这叫“粉刷”；把一桶桶的水倒在每块地板上；再用蘸满软皂和石匠用的沙子的硬刷子，把所有隔墙和壁板刮干净。</p>
<p>窗户肯定逃脱不了一场洪水泛滥。一个仆人攀爬在屋檐外面，冒着扭脖子的危险，手里拿着个大杯子，手边放着个大桶，把那么多的水猛泼到窗玻璃上，对街上的行人完全熟视无睹。</p>
<p>我曾听说，有个人于是对其中一位水神提起法律诉讼，因为他被水神的行动糟蹋了一套新衣服。但在漫长的诉讼过后，法官裁定对造成的损失不需做任何赔偿。因为被告人是在行使她的法定权利，无需对其后果负责。于是那可怜的绅士全盘皆输：既丢了他的衣服，又丢了他的官司。</p>
<p>涂抹刮擦，清洁冲洗，一切有条不紊地进行着，接着是下一个仪式：把移位的家具清理干净、重新摆放。你也许见过一座房子拔地而起，或是一条船下水起航——要是可能，请你回忆一下当时场景的匆忙、喧闹和混乱，你就对这场清洁比赛大概有个了解了。不幸的是，比赛的唯一目标就是把东西弄干净。在这项活动中，无论多少日用品、装饰品或值钱的玩意儿遭到损坏，甚或就此报销，都是不值一提。一把红木椅子和一个精雕细琢的架子受到一视同仁的对待，无论如何都要把它们清理干净，而它们的保养则无需关心。</p>
<p>比如说，有一大幅精美的雕刻画平放在地板上，上面摞着好些小幅的版画，这些版画的重量太大，终于压坏了下面的玻璃——但这是无关紧要的。一幅名贵的油画就靠放在尖利的桌角旁；其他东西又靠放在油画旁边，于是这全部的重量终于逼迫着桌角把那幅油画的画布戳穿。每一幅精美的版画，其画框和镶画的玻璃都要擦拭干净，而清洁所用的酒精和涂油就只好渗进画里，破坏了雕刻的图案——这也没关系。只要玻璃一尘不染，画框光亮可鉴，这就够了；其他的都不必考虑。一位高超的算术家通过长期的经验，做了一个估算，证明两次粉刷墙壁所造成的损失和破坏等同于一次搬家，而三次搬家的后果则不亚于一场火灾。</p>
<p>这场清洁游戏结束了，物品开始恢复它们本来的面目：风暴平息了，一切都会好起来的；但这小小的世界里经受了如此声势浩大的一场动乱，没有造成任何后果就风平浪静却是断无可能的。这场行动过去两三周以后，家人通常都被眼睛酸痛和嗓子发干所折磨，要不就患上严重的感冒，这是由于潮湿的地板和墙壁挥发气味所致。</p>
<p>我认识一位绅士，他喜欢用哲学的方法考虑所有问题。他把我叫作“习俗”的行动看成是一种真正的周期性疾病，与气候密切相关。他的一连串推理异想天开、富于创见，但恕我无暇详述。总之，结果是他发现这种粉刷疾病是无法治愈的；不过在经过大量钻研以后，他自信已发现了一种方法，能让这桩他无法制服的罪行改头换面、获得新生。为此他建了一座面积12平方英尺的房屋，就竖立在他的花园里，房中摆了一些日常用的桌椅，还有几幅最不值钱的图画。他所希望的是，当这种粉刷墙壁的狂热症控制了家里的女性时，她们可以来翻新这座房子，随心所欲地擦洗冲刷涂抹；把这病态的暴力宣泄在“前哨基地”之中，而他就在“总部”安享宁静。但他的试验结果并未如他所愿。这办法断不可行，因为女士们获得快乐的其中一个重要来源，就是每年至少要折磨她的丈夫一次，这是她绝对自由的权力：把丈夫关在门外，一人独揽执政大权。</p>
<p>还有一种妙计，比这哲学家的方法要好得多：把房子里的所有墙壁都用墙纸糊上。很多家里都这么做。尽管它无法根除女性统治的现象，至少还是缩短了期限。这种纸图案多样、画面精美，把房屋打扮得焕然一新，于是女士们欣然接受了这一潮流，却没有觉察设计它的初衷。</p>
<p>还有一种办法能减轻丈夫们的不幸。他通常会拥有一个小房间或一个壁橱的单独使用权，用来放置他的书本文件，其钥匙他准许能自己掌管。这地方可以当作私人禁地，即便是在粉刷季节，它仍然安然无恙地屹立，如同瘟疫肆虐的埃及中的歌珊地
(1)
。但他必须极为小心，随时保卫着他的领地。因为假如他不慎走开，把钥匙忘在了门上，那么总是在窥伺这一机会的女仆就会马上以胜利者的姿态闯入，手里拿着水桶、扫帚和刷子——马上占领了这一处建筑，毫不犹豫地把他的书本和文件“整理妥当”，让他完全陷入混乱之中，有时还损失惨重。</p>

<p>SCHEMES OF LIFE OFTEN ILLUSORY</p>
<p>人生：计划不如变化快</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson, 1700-1784. This truly remarkable man was the son of a
bookseller and stationer; he was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire,
England. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1728; but, at the end
of three years, his poverty compelled him to leave without taking his
degree. In 1736, he married Mrs. Porter, a widow of little culture, much
older than himself, but possessed of some property. The marriage seems
to have been a happy one, nevertheless; and, on the death of his wife,
in 1752, Johnson mourned for her, most sincerely. Soon after his
marriage, he opened a private school, but, obtained only three pupils,
one of whom was David Garrick, afterward the celebrated actor. In 1737,
he removed to London, where he lived for most of the remainder of his
life. Here he entered upon literary work, in which he continued, and
from which he derived his chief support, although at times it was but a
meager one, His “Vanity of Human Wishes” was sold for ten guineas. His
great Dictionary, the first one of the English language worthy of
mention, brought him 1575 Pounds, and occupied his time for seven years.
Most of the money he received for the work went to pay his six
amanuenses. The other most famous of his numerous literary works are
“The Rambler,” “Rasselas,” “The Lives of the English Poets,” and his
edition of Shakespeare. In person, Johnson was heavy and awkward; he was
the victim of scrofula in his youth, and of dropsy in his old age. In
manner, he was boorish and overbearing; but his great powers and his
wisdom caused his company to be sought by many eminent men of his
time.</p>
<p>Omar, the son of Hassan, had passed seventy-five years in honor and
prosperity. The favor of three successive caliphs had filled his house
with gold and silver; and whenever he appeared, the benedictions of the
people proclaimed his passage.</p>
<p>Terrestrial happiness is of short continuance, The brightness of the
flame is wasting its fuel; the fragrant flower is passing away in its
own odors. The vigor of Omar began to fail; the curls of beauty fell
from his head; strength departed from his hands, and agility from his
feet. He gave back to the caliph the keys of trust, and the seals of
secrecy; and sought no other pleasure for the remainder of life than the
converse of the wise and the gratitude of the good.</p>
<p>The powers of his mind were yet unimpaired. His chamber was filled by
visitants, eager to catch the dictates of experience, and officious to
pay the tribute of admiration. Caleb, the son of the viceroy of Egypt,
entered every day early, and retired late. He was beautiful and
eloquent; Omar admired his wit, and loved his docility.</p>
<p>“Tell me,” said Caleb, “thou to whose voice nations have listened,
and whose wisdom is known to the extremities of Asia, tell me, how I may
resemble Omar the prudent? The arts by which thou hast gained power and
preserved it, are to thee no longer necessary or useful; impart to me
the secret of thy conduct, and teach me the plan upon which thy wisdom
has built thy fortune.”</p>
<p>“Young man,” said Omar, “it is of little use to form plans of life.
When I took my first survey of the world, in my twentieth year, having
considered the various conditions of mankind, in the hour of solitude I
said thus to myself, leaning against a cedar which spread its branches
over my head: ’Seventy years are allowed to man; I have yet fifty
remaining.</p>
<p>“’Ten years I will allot to the attainment of knowledge, and ten I
will pass in foreign countries; I shall be learned, and therefore I
shall be honored; every city will shout at my arrival, and every student
will solicit my friendship. Twenty years thus passed will store my mind
with images which I shall be busy through the rest of my life in
combining and comparing. I shall revel in inexhaustible accumulations of
intellectual riches; I shall find new pleasures for every moment, and
shall never more be weary of myself.</p>
<p>“’I will not, however, deviate too far from the beaten track of life;
but will try what can be found in female delicacy. I will marry a wife
as beautiful as the houries, and wise as Zobeide; and with her I will
live twenty years within the suburbs of Bagdad, in every pleasure that
wealth can purchase, and fancy can invent.</p>
<p>“‘I will then retire to a rural dwelling, pass my days in obscurity
and contemplation; and lie silently down on the bed of death. Through my
life it shall be my settled resolution, that I will never depend on the
smile of princes; that I will never stand exposed to the artifices of
courts; I will never pant for public honors, nor disturb my quiet with
the affairs of state.’ Such was my scheme of life, which I impressed
indelibly upon my memory.</p>
<p>“The first part of my ensuing time was to be spent in search of
knowledge, and I know not how I was diverted from my design. I had no
visible impediments without, nor any ungovernable passion within. I
regarded knowledge as the highest honor, and the most engaging pleasure;
yet day stole upon day, and month glided after month, till I found that
seven years of the first ten had vanished, and left nothing behind
them.</p>
<p>“I now postponed my purpose of traveling; for why should I go abroad,
while so much remained to be learned at home? I immured myself for four
years, and studied the laws of the empire. The fame of my skill reached
the judges: I was found able to speak upon doubtful questions, and I was
commanded to stand at the footstool of the caliph. I was heard with
attention; I was consulted with confidence, and the love of praise
fastened on my heart.</p>
<p>“I still wished to see distant countries; listened with rapture to
the relations of travelers, and resolved some time to ask my dismission,
that I might feast my soul with novelty; but my presence was always
necessary, and the stream of business hurried me along. Sometimes, I was
afraid lest I should be charged with ingratitude; but I still proposed
to travel, and therefore would not confine myself by marriage.</p>
<p>“In my fiftieth year, I began to suspect that the time of my
traveling was past; and thought it best to lay hold on the felicity yet
in my power, and indulge myself in domestic pleasures. But, at fifty, no
man easily finds a woman beautiful as the houries, and wise as Zobeide.
I inquired and rejected, consulted and deliberated, till the
sixty-second year made me ashamed of wishing to marry. I had now nothing
left but retirement; and for retirement I never found a time, till
disease forced me from public employment.</p>
<p>“Such was my scheme, and such has been its consequence. With an
insatiable thirst for knowledge, I trifled away the years of
improvement; with a restless desire of seeing different countries, I
have always resided in the same city; with the highest expectation of
connubial felicity, I have lived unmarried; and with an unalterable
resolution of contemplative retirement, I am going to die within the
walls of Bagdad.”</p>

<p>哈桑的儿子奥马尔已过了75岁高寿，尽享荣华富贵。接连三任的哈里发（对穆斯林国家政教领袖的尊称）都对他十分倚重，因而他的家里堆满了金银财宝；只要他一出现，所到之处必是一片欢呼，人们纷纷为他祝福。</p>
<p>世俗的幸福稍纵即逝，明亮的火焰正在消耗它的燃料，芬芳的花朵在四溢的香气之中渐渐凋零。奥马尔的身体开始衰弱了。一绺卷发从他的头上掉落，他的双手没有了力气，双腿也不再矫健敏捷。他向时任的哈里发交还了信任之匙和秘密印章，从此只和睿智之人交谈、得到良善之人感恩，这便是他余生的乐趣，此外别无所求。</p>
<p>他的思维却仍然敏捷过人。他的家里宾客如云，渴望听他亲自讲述种种经历，人们对他交口称颂、赞美不绝。埃及总督的儿子凯勒每天一大早就来到他家，一直到很晚才离去。他风流倜傥、能言会道，奥马尔既欣赏他的才智，也喜欢他的恭顺。</p>
<p>“请您告诉我——”凯勒说：“您的声音有许多国家都曾聆听，您的睿智已传至亚洲最边远的角落——请您告诉我，我如何才能效仿智慧的奥马尔阁下？你赢得大权，又能持盈保泰，而这其中的秘诀对您来说已不再必需。告诉我您行为处事的奥秘吧，您的智慧为您赢取了巨大成功，请教授我您的人生规划吧。”</p>
<p>“年轻人，”奥马尔说：“提前规划人生毫无用处。我20岁那年初次审视世间，独自思考了人类的各种境遇，我靠在一棵枝繁叶茂的雪松上，暗暗对自己说道：‘人一般有70年的寿命，我现在还剩下50年。’”</p>
<p>“’我要用十年的时间学习学问，用十年的时间游历各国。我将成为一个博学的人，我会因此受到人们的尊敬。每个城市都会为我的到来而欢呼，每位学者都渴求我的友谊。在我的想象里，这样过去20年以后，我的余生都将在整合知识、比较见闻中度过。我将沉浸在源源不断的智慧积累之中，我会每时每刻都发现新的快乐，永远不会对人生感到厌倦。</p>
<p>然而我不会离经叛道，我也会尝试去发现女性之娇美，追寻其中的奥妙。我将要娶一位美若天仙、智慧过人的妻子，我将与她一道住在巴格达城郊20年，尽享荣华富贵，尝遍人间欢乐。</p>
<p>随后我将退隐山林，隐姓埋名，在沉思冥想中度日；到了大限到来之日，便静静地躺在床上。这将是我最终的归宿，我从此不再依仗王公贵族的笑脸，不再胆战心惊地参与宫中的争斗，不再渴望荣耀加身，不再被国家的事务扰乱我的平静。’这就是我当初对人生的规划，现在回忆起来还历历在目。</p>
<p>随后我就把时间用于追求学问，但我不知不觉就违背了初衷。我既没有外在事物的阻挠，内心也没有被任何无法驾驭的激情所打扰。我把获取知识看作是最高的荣耀和最快乐的事，然而光阴似箭、日月如梭，等到我发现第一个十年规划中的七年已过去，我却仍然一无所获。</p>
<p>于是我推迟了游历的计划，我在故乡还有很多未曾学习的事物，为何还要到国外去呢？我隐居了四年，学习国家的法律。我的才华声名远播，能与法官媲美；宫廷发现我能就棘手的难题侃侃而谈，我奉命在国王哈里发的王座前伺候。我的话一言九鼎，人们信任我的意见，赞美之词让我的心里充满快乐。</p>
<p>我仍然希望去见识一下遥远的国度，我入迷地聆听出游者的故事，决心有朝一日要辞去官职，让灵魂享受新奇的盛宴。但我位高权重、身不由己，总是被繁杂的公务缠身。有时，我放弃游历的想法，是生怕人们觉得我忘恩负义。但我仍然有这个计划，因此一直独身，不愿受婚姻约束。</p>
<p>到五十岁的时候，我开始觉得自己年纪渐长、出外游历的心愿恐怕要落空，我想最好还是抓住我仍有能力去把握的幸福，享受家庭的乐趣。然而，五十岁的男人要找一位美若天仙、智慧过人的妻子并不容易。我四处打听，一次次拒绝别人的好意；我深思熟虑，为此多次与人长谈商议。一直到了六十二岁，此时再有结婚的想法已经让我感到难为情了。我的心愿全盘落空，只剩下归隐山林了。但我一直没有时间退隐，直到疾病缠身，不得不卸下公职。</p>
<p>这就是我的人生规划，这就是它的结局。我有永不满足的求知欲，却白白地虚度了提升自我的时光；我一直渴望见识各个不同的国家，却总是住在同一座城市；我对婚姻生活的幸福怀有最高的期待，却终身未娶；我痛下决心要独自归隐山林，却将要在这巴格达的城墙里了此一生。”</p>

<p>And he showeth his might on a wild midnight,</p>
<p>When the storms through his branches shout.</p>
<p>In the days of old, when the spring with cold</p>

<p>THE ARTIST SURPRISED</p>
<p>艺术家之惊喜</p>
<p>It may not be known to all the admirers of the genius of Albert
Durer, that that famous engraver was endowed with a “better half,” so
peevish in temper, that she was the torment not only of his own life,
but also of his pupils and domestics. Some of the former were cunning
enough to purchase peace for themselves by conciliating the common
tyrant, but woe to those unwilling or unable to offer aught in
propitiation. Even the wiser ones were spared only by having their
offenses visited upon a scapegoat.</p>
<p>This unfortunate individual was Samuel Duhobret, a disciple whom
Durer had admitted into his school out of charity. He was employed in
painting signs and the coarser tapestry then used in Germany. He was
about forty years of age, little, ugly, and humpbacked; he was the butt
of every ill joke among his fellow disciples, and was picked out as an
object of especial dislike by Madame Durer. But he bore all with
patience, and ate, without complaint, the scanty crusts given him every
day for dinner, while his companions often fared sumptuously.</p>
<p>Poor Samuel had not a spice of envy or malice in his heart. He would,
at any time, have toiled half the night to assist or serve those who
were wont oftenest to laugh at him, or abuse him loudest for his
stupidity. True, he had not the qualities of social humor or wit, but he
was an example of indefatigable industry. He came to his studies every
morning at daybreak, and remained at work until sunset. Then he retired
into his lonely chamber, and wrought for his own amusement.</p>
<p>Duhobret labored three years in this way, giving himself no time for
exercise or recreation. He said nothing to a single human being of the
paintings he had produced in the solitude of his cell, by the light of
his lamp. But his bodily energies wasted and declined under incessant
toil. There was none sufficiently interested in the poor artist, to mark
the feverish hue of his wrinkled cheek, or the increasing attenuation of
his misshapen frame.</p>
<p>None observed that the uninviting pittance set aside for his midday
repast, remained for several days untouched. Samuel made his appearance
regularly as ever, and bore with the same meekness the gibes of his
fellow-pupils, or the taunts of Madame Durer, and worked with the same
untiring assiduity, though his hands would sometimes tremble, and his
eyes become suffused, a weakness probably owing to the excessive use he
had made of them.</p>
<p>One morning Duhobret was missing at the scene of his daily labors.
His absence created much remark, and many were the jokes passed upon the
occasion. One surmised this, and another that, as the cause of the
phenomenon; and it was finally agreed that the poor fellow must have
worked himself into an absolute skeleton, and taken his final stand in
the glass frame of some apothecary, or been blown away by a puff of
wind, while his door happened to stand open. No on thought of going to
his lodgings to look after him or his remains.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the object of their mirth was tossing on a bed of
sickness. Disease, which had been slowly sapping the foundations of his
strength, burned in every vein; his eyes rolled and flashed in delirium;
his lips, usually so silent, muttered wild and incoherent words. In his
days of health, poor Duhobret had his dreams, as all artists, rich or
poor, will sometimes have. He had thought that the fruit of many years’
labor, disposed of to advantage, might procure him enough to live, in an
economical way, for the rest of his life. He never anticipated fame or
fortune; the height of his ambition or hope was, to possess a tenement
large enough to shelter him from the inclemencies of the weather, with
means enough to purchase one comfortable meal per day.</p>
<p>Now, alas! however, even that one hope had deserted him. He thought
himself dying, and thought it hard to die without one to look kindly
upon him, without the words of comfort that might soothe his passage to
another world. He fancied his bed surrounded by fiendish faces, grinning
at his sufferings, and taunting his inability to summon power to
disperse them. At length the apparition faded away, and the patient sunk
into an exhausted slumber.</p>
<p>He awoke unrefreshed; it was the fifth day he had lain there
neglected. His mouth was parched; he turned over, and feebly stretched
out his hand toward the earthen pitcher, from which, since the first day
of his illness he had quenched his thirst. Alas! it was empty! Samuel
lay for a few moments thinking what he should do. He knew he must die of
want if he remained there alone; but to whom could he apply for aid?</p>
<p>An idea seemed, at last, to strike him. He arose slowly, and with
difficulty, from the bed, went to the other side of the room, and took
up the picture he had painted last. He resolved to carry it to the shop
of a salesman, and hoped to obtain for it sufficient to furnish him with
the necessaries of life for a week longer. Despair lent him strength to
walk, and to carry his burden. On his way, he passed a house, about
which there was a crowd. He drew nigh, asked what was going on, and
received for an answer, that there was to be a sale of many specimens of
art, collected by an amateur in the course of thirty years. It has often
happened that collections made with infinite pains by the proprietor,
have been sold without mercy or discrimination after his death.</p>
<p>Something whispered to the weary Duhobret, that here would be the
market for his picture. It was a long way yet to the house of the
picture dealer, and he made up his mind at once. He worked his way
through the crowd, dragged himself up the steps, and, after many
inquiries, found the auctioneer. That personage was a busy man, with a
handful of papers; he was inclined to notice somewhat roughly the
interruption of the lean, sallow hunchback, imploring as were his
gesture and language.</p>
<p>“What do you call your picture?” at length, said he, carefully
looking at it.</p>
<p>“It is a view of the Abbey of Newburg, with its village and the
surrounding landscape,” replied the eager and trembling artist.</p>
<p>The auctioneer again scanned it contemptuously, and asked what it was
worth. “Oh, that is what you please; whatever it will bring,” answered
Duhobret.</p>
<p>“Hem! it is too odd to please, I should think; I can promise you no
more than three thalers.”</p>
<p>Poor Samuel sighed deeply. He had spent on that piece the nights of
many months. But he was starving now; and the pitiful sum offered would
give bread for a few days. He nodded his head to the auctioneer, and
retiring took his seat in a corner.</p>
<p>The sale began. After some paintings and engravings had been disposed
of, Samuel’s was exhibited. “Who bids at three thalers? Who bids?” was
the cry. Duhobret listened eagerly, but none answered. “Will it find a
purchaser?” said he despondingly, to himself. Still there was a dead
silence. He dared not look up; for it seemed to him that all the people
were laughing at the folly of the artist, who could be insane enough to
offer so worthless a piece at a public sale.</p>
<p>“What will become of me?” was his mental inquiry. “That work is
certainly my best;” and he ventured to steal another glance. “Does it
not seem that the wind actually stirs those boughs and moves those
leaves! How transparent is the water! What life breathes in the animals
that quench their thirst at that spring! How that steeple shines! How
beautiful are those clustering trees!” This was the last expiring throb
of an artist’s vanity. The ominous silence continued, and Samuel, sick
at heart, buried his face in his hands.</p>
<p>“Twenty-one thalers!” murmured a faint voice, just as the auctioneer
was about to knock down the picture. The stupefied painter gave a start
of joy. He raised his head and looked to see from whose lips those
blessed words had come. It was the picture dealer, to whom he had first
thought of applying.</p>
<p>“Fifty thalers,” cried a sonorous voice. This time a tall man in
black was the speaker. There was a silence of hushed expectation. “One
hundred thalers,” at length thundered the picture dealer.</p>
<p>“Three hundred!” “Five hundred!” “One thousand!” Another profound
silence, and the crowd pressed around the two opponents, who stood
opposite each other with eager and angry looks.</p>
<p>“Two thousand thalers!” cried the picture dealer, and glanced around
him triumphantly, when he saw his adversary hesitate. “Ten thousand!”
vociferated the tall man, his face crimson with rage, and his hands
clinched convulsively. The dealer grew paler; his frame shook with
agitation; he made two or three efforts, and at last cried out “Twenty
thousand!”</p>
<p>His tall opponent was not to be vanquished. He bid forty thousand.
The dealer stopped; the other laughed a low laugh of insolent triumph,
and a murmur of admiration was heard in the crowd. It was too much for
the dealer; he felt his peace was at stake. “Fifty thousand!” exclaimed
he in desperation. It was the tall man’s turn to hesitate. Again the
whole crowd were breathless. At length, tossing his arms in defiance, he
shouted “One hundred thousand!” The crestfallen picture dealer withdrew;
the tall man victoriously bore away the prize.</p>
<p>How was it, meanwhile, with Duhobret, while this exciting scene was
going on? He was hardly master of his senses. He rubbed his eyes
repeatedly, and murmured to himself, “After such a dream, my misery will
seem more cruel!” When the contest ceased, he rose up bewildered, and
went about asking first one, then another, the price of the picture just
sold. It seemed that his apprehension could not at once be enlarged to
so vast a conception.</p>
<p>The possessor was proceeding homeward, when a decrepit, lame, and
humpbacked invalid, tottering along by the aid of a stick, presented
himself before him. He threw him a piece of money, and waved his hand as
dispensing with his thanks. “May it please your honor,” said the
supposed beggar, “I am the painter of that picture!” and again he rubbed
his eyes.</p>
<p>The tall mall was Count Dunkelsback, one of the richest noblemen in
Germany. He stopped, took out his pocketbook, took out a leaf, and wrote
on it a few lines. “Take it, friend,” said he; “it is a check for your
money. Adieu.”</p>
<p>Duhobret finally persuaded himself that it was not a dream. He became
the master of a castle, sold it, and resolved to live luxuriously for
the rest of his life, and to cultivate painting as a pastime. But, alas,
for the vanity of human expectation! He had borne privation and toil;
prosperity was too much for him, as was proved soon after, when an
indigestion carried him off. His picture remained long in the cabinet of
Count Dunkelsback, and afterward passed into the possession of the King
of Bavaria.</p>

<p>对于所有崇拜艾伯特·丢勒才华的人来说，他们也许并不知道这个著名的雕刻家是“家有贤妻”，这位夫人性情喜怒无常，不只让丢勒的生活饱受折磨，还殃及池鱼，连他的学生和家里人也不能幸免。有些人处事圆滑，懂得取悦这位蛮横跋扈的夫人，于是能与她和平共处。但那些不愿意或不懂得察言观色的人就倒霉了。即便是那些聪明的人，一旦被找茬时也只能找个替罪羊来顶罪。这个不幸的家伙叫塞缪尔·杜霍布雷特，他是丢勒的学徒，丢勒出于怜悯才把他破格录入门下。塞缪尔负责绘制标牌和粗制挂毯，这些产品随后会运往德国。他四十岁上下，小个子，驼背，相貌丑陋。其他的学徒老是捉弄他，向他开恶毒的玩笑；丢勒夫人特别讨厌他，简直把他视为眼中钉。但他一言不发地忍受着这一切，每天晚上吃饭时都毫无怨言，默默地吃完那少得可怜的面包皮，而他的同伴却常常享用丰盛的晚餐。</p>
<p>可怜的塞缪尔心里却没有一丝嫉妒或怨恨。他总是埋头苦干至深夜，那些笑他笑得最厉害、放肆地骂他是蠢驴的人，在他的伺候或协助下干活。确实，他是个缺乏幽默感和才智的人，但他却是不屈不挠、勤奋刻苦的榜样。他每天黎明时分就来到他的工作室，一直干到太阳西下。随后他就回到自己那孤独的小房间里，精心绘画自己的作品，从中寻找乐趣。</p>
<p>塞缪尔就这样辛苦劳作了三年，无暇锻炼身体，更没有消遣娱乐。他独自一人呆在房里的时候，靠着油灯的微光绘成了一些画作，这件事他一个字也没和别人提起。但长年累月的苦工耗费了他的体能，他的身体也渐渐衰弱。没有人会特意关注这位可怜的艺术家，注意到他刻满皱纹的脸颊上泛起了热病的红晕，而他那佝偻的身体正日渐消瘦下去。</p>
<p>分配给他的午餐少得可怜，且看起来让人毫无食欲——没有人留意到他已经好些天没有动过这份午餐了。塞缪尔像往常一样按时出现，仍然一声不吭地忍受着同伴们的嘲弄和丢勒太太的奚落，还是一样不知疲倦地勤奋工作。不过他的双手有时会颤抖，他的眼睛开始模糊，这大概是他用眼过度落下的毛病。</p>
<p>有一天早上，画室里不见了塞缪尔平常工作的身影。他的缺席让大家议论纷纷，很多人拿他开玩笑。人们猜测着他没来的原因，一个猜是这样，另一个猜是那样。最后人们一致认为这个可怜虫肯定是过于拼命，累得只剩下骨头架子，正在某个药商的橱窗里做最后的展示；要不就是他住所的门打开时，刚好来了一阵风，把他给吹走了。没有人想到要去他的住所找找他——或者是说找找他的骸骨。</p>
<p>此时，逗得众人哄堂大笑的对象正辗转病床。疾病已慢慢毁掉了他的身体，耗尽了他的心血。他翻着白眼，神志不清，他那平常总是紧闭着的双唇，如今正喃喃地说着胡话，前言不搭后语。在身体还健硕的时候，可怜的塞缪尔也有他的梦想，这是普天下所有的艺术家都曾经拥有的，无所谓贫富贵贱。他曾梦想多年的辛劳终将会获得回报，也许会给他带来经济利益，让他有足够的能力安度余生。他从未期盼会获得声名或财富，他最大的野心和希望就是能住进一间免受风吹日晒的廉价公寓，同时每天能吃上一顿丰盛的饭菜。</p>
<p>啊，现在他落得如此境地！即便连唯一的希望也落空了。他觉得自己快要死了。而在弥留之际，却没有一个人能对他稍稍友善一些，没有一句安慰的话能伴他走向另一个世界，让他觉得死是一件多么难受的事。他产生了幻觉，看见床边围着一张张恶魔的脸，狞笑着看他饱受折磨，嘲笑他无法振作起来驱散它们。最后那些幻象终于消失了，这个病魔缠身的人筋疲力尽地睡了过去。</p>
<p>他醒来的时候仍是昏昏沉沉的。他独自躺在病榻上已经五天了，一个人也没来看他一眼。他嗓子渴得冒烟，转了个身，无力地伸手去够盛水的泥壶，从病倒的第一天开始，他就是从泥壶里取水来喝，润润干渴的喉咙。天啊！泥壶已经空了！塞缪尔静静地躺了一会儿，思索着该怎么办。他知道如果再这样独自困在病床上，自己肯定会死的。但他又能向谁求助呢？</p>
<p>最后，他的脑子里忽然闪过了一个念头。他慢慢地爬起身，艰难地从床边挪到房子的另一头，拿起他最后绘制的那幅画作。他决定要把画拿到画商那儿，希望能拿它卖点儿钱，换回来一周的生活必需品。绝处求生的欲望给了他行走的力气，他扛着那幅画出了门。在路上，他经过了一栋房子，看见那儿围着一堆人。他凑上前去，询问发生了什么事情。有人告诉他说，里面正在举行艺术品大拍卖，是一位业余爱好者花了三十年时间收集而来的。收藏家历尽千辛万苦谋得的收藏品，去世后却被不分优劣地无情拍卖，这也是司空见惯的事情。</p>
<p>塞缪尔此时已精疲力竭，耳边似乎响起了一个声音，悄悄地对他说他应该在这儿卖出他的画作。到画商的店里还有很长一段路，于是他马上改变了原来的主意。他挤进人群之中，奋力爬上台阶，问了一个又一个人，最后找到了拍卖者。他正忙着，手里捧着一摞画。此时来人贸然打断了他的忙碌，他看见这是个骨瘦如柴、脸色灰黄的驼背家伙，低声下气地在哀求着什么。</p>
<p>“你的画是什么内容？”他仔细地看着那幅画，终于开口了。</p>
<p>“画的是纽堡修道院的景色，还有它周围的村庄和田野。”这位急切的艺术家战战兢兢地回答道。</p>
<p>拍卖者又轻蔑地扫视了一眼画作，问塞缪尔这画卖多少钱。“啊，您卖多少钱都行，能卖多少就卖多少吧。”塞缪尔答道。</p>
<p>“哎！这画太古怪了，我觉得很难卖掉。我向你保证，不会超过三个银币 (1)
。”</p>
<p>可怜的塞缪尔深深地叹了一口气。他为了绘制那幅画，花了好几个月时间，每天都画至深夜。但他如今正饿得头晕眼花，那少得可怜的三个银币可以让他吃上几天面包了。他朝拍卖者点点头，就退到角落里头坐下了。</p>
<p>拍卖开始了。在卖出几幅油画和版画后，拍卖者展示了塞缪尔的画作。“谁出三个银币？有人买吗？”他叫喊道。塞缪尔伸长了脖子聆听着，但没有人回应。“这幅画会有买家吗？”他失望地自语。会场上仍然是一片安静。他不敢再抬头了，似乎所有人都在讥笑这位画家的荒唐，竟然拿了一幅不值一文的作品在拍卖场上出售。</p>
<p>“我会落得怎样的下场？”他扪心自问。“那幅画无疑是我最出色的作品。”他鼓起勇气瞥了一眼。“大风吹得枝条摇摆、树叶晃动，难道不是很逼真吗！看那水流，简直是清澈见底！看那正在清泉边上饮水的动物，是多么栩栩如生！教堂的尖顶闪耀着光辉！那一丛丛的绿树多么动人！”艺术家的最后一丝自负在做垂死挣扎。周围仍然是一片不妙的寂静。塞缪尔心如刀割，把脸埋到了双手之间。</p>
<p>“21个银币！”就在拍卖者要落槌示意流拍之际，响起了一个微弱无力的声音。画家目瞪口呆，一脸惊喜。他抬起头，想看看是谁发出了如此慈悲之言。叫价的是画商，他起初就是想把画拿给他的。</p>
<p>“50个银币！”一个洪亮的声音喊道。这次叫价的是个身穿黑衣的高个子男人。会场一片沉默，大家都在安静地等待着。“100个银币！”画商终于大吼道。</p>
<p>“300！”“500！”“1000！”接下来又陷入了长长的沉默。人们纷纷上前，把这两个竞争对手围在中间；两人面对面地站着，怒容满面，一副志在必得的样子。</p>
<p>“2000！”画商喊道，他看见对手有些犹豫，便得意扬扬地打量着他。“一万！”高个子男人嚷着，他的脸愤怒得涨成了猪肝色，双手紧紧地绞在一起。画商的脸色变白了，身子激动得直打战。他两次三番地张嘴，终于喊出声：“两万！”</p>
<p>他的高个子对手是绝不能忍受失败的。他出价4万。画商沉默了，对手发出低沉的笑声，充满了胜利的傲慢，人群中议论纷纷，一片赞叹之声。画商忍无可忍，终于爆发了。“5万！”他不顾一切地喊道。轮到高个子男人犹豫了。人群再次屏住呼吸。最后他毅然迎接挑战，振臂高呼道：“10万！”画商败下阵来，一副垂头丧气的样子；高个子男人则胜利夺得了奖品。</p>
<p>此时，在这番激动人心的场景之下，塞缪尔怎样了呢？他几乎不敢相信眼前的一切是真的。他不停地揉着双眼，自言自语道：“做了这么一场美梦，我的人生就显得更悲惨了！这对我太残忍了！”那场竞价大赛结束了，他不知所措地站起身来，问了一个人画作卖出的价钱，然后又问了另一个。看起来他的理解能力有限，似乎无法立刻领会那个天文数字。</p>
<p>买下画的人回家了，这虚弱而驼背的家伙跛着脚，拄着一根棍子踉踉跄跄地追上去，拦住了他的去路。他扔了些钱给这个家伙，又摆了摆手，示意不用道谢。“但愿您会喜欢它，”被当作乞丐的家伙说到：“我就是那副画作的作者！”他又揉了揉双眼。买下画的高个子男人是敦克尔斯巴克伯爵，是整个德国最富有的贵族之一。他停下脚步，拿出他的支票本，撕下了其中一张，在上面写了几行字。“朋友，把它拿去吧。”他说，“这是你的支票。再会。”</p>
<p>塞缪尔终于能说服自己，这一切并不是做梦。他成了一座城堡的主人，又把城堡卖掉，并决心从此要好好享受人生，只把绘画作为一种消遣。啊，然而人的愿望总是转眼成空啊！他习惯了忍饥挨饿、辛苦劳作，竟享用不了这样的财富。就像要验证他就是薄命之人一样，不久他就由于消化不良而一命呜呼了。他的画作一直扔在敦克尔斯巴克伯爵的橱子里，后来又辗转到了巴伐利亚国王的手里。</p>

<p>PICTURES OF MEMORY</p>
<p>追忆如画</p>
<p>Alice Cary, 1820-1871, was born near Cincinnati. One of her ancestors
was among the “Pilgrim Fathers,” and the first instructor of Latin at
Plymouth, Mass. Miss Cary commenced her literary career at her western
home, and, in 1849, published a volume of poems, the joint work of her
younger sister, Phoebe, and herself. In 1850, she moved to New York. Two
of her sisters joined her there, and they supported themselves by their
literary labor. Their home became a noted resort for their literary and
artistic friends. Miss Cary was the author of eleven volumes, besides
many articles contributed to periodicals. Her poetry is marked with
great sweetness and pathos. Some of her prose works are much admired,
especially her “Clovernook Children.”</p>
<p>Among the beautiful pictures</p>
<p>That hang on Memory’s wall,</p>
<p>Is one of a dim old forest,</p>
<p>That seemeth best of all;</p>
<p>Not for its gnarled oaks olden,</p>
<p>Dark with the mistletoe;</p>
<p>Not for the violets golden,</p>
<p>That sprinkle the vale below;</p>
<p>Not for the milk-white lilies,</p>
<p>That lean from the fragrant hedge,</p>
<p>Coquetting all day with the sunbeams,</p>
<p>And stealing their golden edge;</p>
<p>Not for the vines on the upland,</p>
<p>Where the bright red berries rest,</p>
<p>Nor the pinks, nor the pale, sweet cowslip,</p>
<p>It seemeth to me the best.</p>
<p>I once had a little brother,</p>
<p>With eyes that were dark and deep;</p>
<p>In the lap of that dim old forest,</p>
<p>He lieth in peace asleep:</p>
<p>Light as the down of the thistle,</p>
<p>Free as the winds that blow,</p>
<p>We roved there the beautiful summers,</p>
<p>The summers of long ago;</p>
<p>But his feet on the hills grew weary,</p>
<p>And, one of the autumn eves,</p>
<p>I made for my little brother,</p>
<p>A bed of the yellow leaves.</p>
<p>Sweetly his pale arms folded</p>
<p>My neck in a meek embrace,</p>
<p>As the light of immortal beauty</p>
<p>Silently covered his face;</p>
<p>And when the arrows of sunset</p>
<p>Lodged in the tree tops bright,</p>
<p>He fell, in his saintlike beauty,</p>
<p>Asleep by the gates of light.</p>
<p>Therefore, of all the pictures</p>
<p>That hang on Memory’s wall,</p>
<p>The one of the dim old forest</p>

<p>THE MORNING ORATORIO</p>
<p>晨歌</p>
<p>Wilson Flagg, 1806-1884, was born in Beverly, Mass. He pursued his
academical course in Andover, at Phillips Academy, and entered Harvard
College, but did not graduate. His chief Works are: “Studies in the
Field and Forest,” “The Woods and Byways of New England,” and “The Birds
and Seasons of New England.”</p>
<p>Nature, for the delight of waking eyes, has arrayed the morning
heavens in the loveliest hues of beauty. Fearing to dazzle by an excess
of delight, she first announces day by a faint and glimmering twilight,
then sheds a purple tint over the brows of the rising morn, and infuses
a transparent ruddiness throughout the atmosphere. As daylight widens,
successive groups of mottled and rosy-bosomed clouds assemble on the
gilded sphere, and, crowned with wreaths of fickle rainbows, spread a
mirrored flush over hill, grove, and lake, and every village spire is
burnished with their splendor.</p>
<p>At length, through crimsoned vapors, we behold the sun’s broad disk,
rising with a countenance so serene that every eye may view him ere he
arrays himself in his meridian brightness. Not many people who live in
towns are aware of the pleasure attending a ramble near the woods and
orchards at daybreak in the early part of summer. The drowsiness we feel
on rising from our beds is gradually dispelled by the clear and
healthful breezes of early day, and we soon experience an unusual amount
of vigor and elasticity.</p>
<p>During the night, the stillness of all things is the circumstance
that most powerfully attracts our notice, rendering us peculiarly
sensitive to every accidental sound that meets the ear. In the morning,
at this time of year, on the contrary, we are overpowered by the vocal
and multitudinous chorus of the feathered tribe. If you would hear the
commencement of this grand anthem of nature, you must rise at the very
first appearance of dawn, before the twilight has formed a complete
semicircle above the eastern porch of heaven.</p>
<p>The first note that proceeds from the little warbling host, is the
shrill chirp of the hairbird,—occasionally vocal at an hours on a warm
summer night. This strain, which is a continued trilling sound, is
repeated with diminishing intervals, until it becomes almost incessant.
But ere the hairbird has uttered many notes, a single robin begins to
warble from a neighboring orchard, soon followed by others, increasing
in numbers until, by the time the eastern sky is flushed with crimson,
every male, robin in the country round is singing with fervor.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to note the exact order in which the different
birds successively begin their parts in this performance; but the
bluebird, whose song is only a short, mellow warble, is heard nearly at
the same time with the robin, and the song sparrow joins them soon after
with his brief but finely modulated strain. The different species follow
rapidly, one after another, in the chorus, until the whole welkin rings
with their matin hymn of gladness.</p>
<p>I have often wondered that the almost simultaneous utterance of so
many different notes should produce no discords, and that they should
result in such complete harmony. In this multitudinous confusion of
voices, no two notes are confounded, and none has sufficient duration to
grate harshly with a dissimilar sound. Though each performer sings only
a few strains and then makes a pause, the whole multitude succeed one
another with such rapidity that we hear an uninterrupted flow of music
until the broad light of day invites them to other employments.</p>
<p>When there is just light enough to distinguish the birds, we may
observe, here and there, a single swallow perched on the roof of a barn
or shed, repeating two twittering notes incessantly, with a quick turn
and a hop at every note he utters. It would seem to be the design of the
bird to attract the attention of his mate, and this motion seems to be
made to assist her in discovering his position. As soon as the light has
tempted him to fly abroad, this twittering strain is uttered more like a
continued song, as he flits rapidly through the air.</p>
<p>But at this later moment the purple martins have commenced their more
melodious chattering, so loud as to attract for a while the most of our
attention. There is not a sound in nature so cheering and animating as
the song of the purple martin, and none so well calculated to drive away
melancholy. Though not one of the earliest voices to be heard, the
chorus is perceptibly more loud and effective when this bird has united
with the choir.</p>
<p>When the flush of the morning has brightened into vermilion, and the
place from which the sun is soon to emerge has attained a dazzling
brilliancy, the robins are already less tuneful. They are now becoming
busy in collecting food for their morning repast, and one by one they
leave the trees, and may be seen hopping upon the tilled ground, in
quest of the worms and insects that, have crept out during the night
from their subterranean retreats.</p>
<p>But as the robins grow silent, the bobolinks begin their vocal
revelries; and to a fanciful mind it might seem that the robins had
gradually resigned their part in the performance to the bobolinks, not
one of which is heard until some of the former have concluded their
songs. The little hairbird still continues his almost incessant
chirping, the first to begin and the last to quit the performance.
Though the voice of this bird is not very sweetly modulated, it blends
harmoniously with the notes of other birds, and greatly increases the
charming effect of the combination.</p>
<p>It would be tedious to name all the birds that take part in this
chorus; but we must not omit the pewee, with his melancholy ditty,
occasionally heard like a short minor strain in an oratorio; nor the
oriole, who is really one of the chief performers, and who, as his
bright plumage flashes upon the sight, warbles forth a few notes so
clear and mellow as to be beard above every other sound. Adding a
pleasing variety to all this harmony, the lisping notes of the
meadowlark, uttered in a shrill tone, and with a peculiar pensive
modulation, are plainly audible, with short rests between each
repetition.</p>
<p>There is a little brown sparrow, resembling the hairbird, save a
general tint of russet in his plumage, that may be heard distinctly
among the warbling host. He is rarely seen in cultivated grounds, but
frequents the wild pastures, and is the bird that warbles so sweetly at
midsummer, when the whortleberries are ripe, and the fields are
beautifully spangled with red lilies.</p>
<p>There is no confusion in the notes of his song, which consists of one
syllable rapidly repeated, but increasing in rapidity and rising to a
higher key towards the conclusion. He sometimes prolongs his strain,
when his notes are observed to rise and fall in succession. These
plaintive and expressive notes are very loud and constantly uttered,
during the hour that precedes the rising of the sun. A dozen warblers of
this species, singing in concert, and distributed in different parts of
the field, form, perhaps, the most delightful part of the woodland
oratorio to which we have listened.</p>
<p>At sunrise hardly a robin can be beard in the whole neighborhood, and
the character of the performance has completely changed during the last
half hour. The first part was more melodious and tranquilizing, the last
is more brilliant and animating. The grass finches, the vireos, the
wrens, and the linnets have joined their voices to the chorus, and the
bobolinks are loudest in their song. But the notes of the birds in
general are not so incessant as before sunrise. One by one they
discontinue their lays, until at high noon the bobolink and the warbling

<p>自然，为刚刚睁开的双眼带来欢悦，用最动人的美丽色调涂抹了清晨的天空。她生怕这欢悦太多，会让人眼花缭乱，起初便只用微微的晨光宣告白日的来临，随后在渐升的曙光之上倾注了一抹紫色，又往整个天空泼洒了轻透的嫣红。随着天色渐亮，彤云不断涌入镀金的天空中，变幻莫测的彩虹编成花环，仿佛为它们加冕；山林湖泊之间映照出一片红光，每个村庄的教堂尖顶都在曙光的精心打磨下闪闪发亮。</p>
<p>终于，在一片绯红的氤氲之中，我们注视着太阳那大大的圆盘冉冉升起，如此庄严沉静，不等它完全释放出所有的光芒，世间的每双眼睛都已留意到它的存在。在初夏的拂晓来到丛林和果园附近漫步，这其中的愉悦，住在城镇里头的人们鲜少能体会。清爽宜人的晨风吹来，渐渐驱散了我们晨起时的昏沉睡意，很快我们就感到神清气爽、活力十足。</p>
<p>夜里，大自然的万籁俱寂最让我们震撼，我们的听觉变得异样灵敏，每一个不经意的声响都逃不过我们的耳朵。而每年这个时节的清晨，情况则恰恰相反，打动我们的是百鸟啁啾，是那声势浩大的朝歌。这是首盛大的自然礼赞，若是你不想错过倾听它的开场，你就得赶在拂晓初至时起床，切莫等到微微的晨光在东方的天际画出明亮的半圆。</p>
<p>这些大自然的小主人们即将一展歌喉，黄道眉细而亮的一声脆啼唱响了它们的第一个音符——这样的歌唱，在温暖的夏夜里偶尔也会响上一会儿。这一段乐曲是一连串颤音，一次次地重复着，间隔越来越短，直到最后几乎连成了一片音。但不等那黄道眉哼出更多的旋律，一只独身的知更鸟就开始在邻近的果园里婉转歌唱，很快其他的伙伴也纷纷加入其中，直到东方的天空焕发出绯红的光芒，乡间的每一只雄性知更鸟都热情万丈地欢唱起来。</p>
<p>要想辨清整场演出中各种鸟儿们开唱的先后顺序，那可绝非易事。而蓝鸫的歌声短促而柔和，它几乎与知更鸟一同亮嗓；还有不甘居后的歌雀，在一小段悠扬的变调后便加入了合唱之中。其他各种鸟儿也争先恐后地一展歌喉，直到这一曲欢乐的清晨颂歌，响彻云霄。</p>
<p>常常让我惊叹的是，这千百种不同的音符几乎是同时奏响，听起来却没有一丝杂音，恍若浑然天成。在这纷繁的多声部大融合之中，没有哪两个音符互相抵触，也没有谁的声音一直持续到让人觉得刺耳突兀。尽管每位表演者只演唱一个小乐段便稍作停歇，但其他歌手会立即接上，一个接一个地轮番登场，于是我们听到的乐曲始终源源不断如行云流水，直到日光渐炽，歌唱家们转而为其他事情奔忙去了。</p>
<p>当黎明的微光足以分辨各种鸟儿之时，也许我们便会看到一只单身的燕子飞落在谷仓或木棚的顶上，他不停地重复着两个颤音，每蹦出一个音符，都伴随着一个小跳和转身。这仿佛是鸟儿故意要用这动作吸引雌鸟的眼光，让她能轻易发现求爱者所在的方向。一到天色渐明，召唤他展翅高飞，当他穿行在云天之间，这啁啾的乐段便让他唱成了连绵不断的歌谣。</p>
<p>然而过了一刻，紫色的圣马丁鸟便亮开嗓子，唱出更为优美动听的歌声，这歌声如此嘹亮，有好一会儿，我们的注意力都被它们吸引过去了。自然界里再也没有哪种声音能像紫崖燕的歌声那样令人欢喜鼓舞，所有的忧愁都会在这歌声里消散。尽管这不是我们最早听到的歌声，但当这种鸟儿加入唱诗班之时，这大合唱的圣歌便陡然变得更嘹亮动人了。</p>
<p>当晨曦中的红晕颜色渐浓，太阳初升之地披上万丈霞光，知更鸟的鸣叫已经有些漫不经心了。它们一个接一个地飞离了树梢，开始为早餐搜寻食物而奔忙；也许你能在犁过的田地上看到它们跳跃的身影，它们在那里搜寻着，想找到那些夜里从藏身之所悄悄爬出来的蚯蚓和小虫。</p>
<p>但知更鸟的歌声刚刚沉寂，稻雀便开始骄纵狂歌了。在想象丰富的人眼里，这仿佛是知更鸟准备退居幕后，把表演的舞台拱手相让，而稻雀亦耐心待到众位前辈一曲唱毕才放声高歌。小小的黄道眉唱得最为卖力，从开场到落幕，它那不知停歇的歌声贯穿始终。尽管这鸟儿的声音不够甜美柔和，但却与其他鸟儿的歌声融合得天衣无缝，让这合唱之歌大为增色。</p>
<p>要把合唱团里的所有成员一一道来，恐怕会冗长得令人生厌；但我们不得不提一下京燕，整首赞歌里它只是间或哼上一小段旋律，可那小调却能唱得让人愁肠百转；我们也不能遗漏黄鹂的名字，它是名副其实的主唱之一，它的羽衣鲜艳夺目，它的歌喉清亮圆润，在众多声音中显得如此卓尔不群。还有野云雀的清脆乐音，为这所有的和声加入了一种欢快的变调；它的音色尖细，歌声里带有一种特别的幽怨，稍稍停歇后复又重唱，声声悦耳。</p>
<p>还有一种褐色的小麻雀，除了羽毛上星星点点的黄褐色以外，与黄道眉的样子并无二致。它的歌声在群鸟的鸣啭中清晰可闻。它极少出现在业已耕作的田间，而在荒野上却到处可见它的身影。在越橘饱满成熟、田野缀满红百合的仲夏，你就会听到它格外甜美的歌声。</p>
<p>它的歌声里没有混杂繁复的音符，只有一个不断重复的音节，它越唱越快，音调越来越高，一口气唱至曲终。有时它会放缓节奏、拉长乐段，歌曲的旋律听起来就变得时高时低、跌宕起伏。在日出前的一小时里，这哀怨动人的曲调持续不断，富有穿透力的歌声余韵悠长。演唱会里有十几个这样的歌手，它的歌声飞散田野，也许是我们聆听的这场林间清唱剧里最为华美的乐章。</p>
<p>到了日出时分，整片树林几乎听不到一只知更鸟的鸣叫，这场演出在最后半小时全部换了角色。第一幕的清唱剧更柔和悠扬，而最后一幕听起来更为辉煌壮丽、动人心魄。草地雀、绿鹃、鹪鹩和朱顶雀都亮开嗓门加入了合唱，其中要数稻雀的歌声最为嘹亮。但鸟儿们的演唱听起来已没有日出前那么踊跃了。它一个接一个地安静下来，到了正午太阳高照的时候，田间几乎只剩下稻雀与捕蝇鸟这两位歌唱家还在低吟浅唱了。</p>

<p>A cloud lay cradled near the setting sun,</p>

<p>Wafted the traveler to the beauteous west.</p>
<p>Emblem, methought, of the departed soul,</p>
<p>To whose white robe the gleam of bliss is given,</p>
<p>And by the breath of mercy made to roll</p>
<p>Right onward to the golden gate of heaven,</p>
<p>While to the eye of faith it peaceful lies,</p>
<p>And tells to man his glorious destinies.</p>

<p>V. OLD AGE AND DEATH.</p>
<p>Edmund Waller, 1605-1687, an English poet, was a cousin of John
Hampden, and related to Oliver Cromwell. He was educated at Eton and
Cambridge. Waller was for many years a member of Parliament. He took
part in the civil war, and was detected in a treasonable plot. Several
years of his life were spent in exile in France. After the Restoration
he came into favor at court. His poetry is celebrated for smoothness and
sweetness, but is disfigured by affected conceits.</p>
<p>The seas are quiet when the winds give o’er;</p>

<p>DEATH OF LITTLE NELL</p>
<p>耐儿之死</p>
<p>Charles Dickens. 1812-1870, one of the greatest novelists of modern
times, was born in Portsmouth, but spent nearly all his life in London.
His father was a conscientious man, but lacked capacity for getting a
livelihood. In consequence, the boy’s youth was much darkened by
poverty. It has been supposed that he pictured his father in the
character of “Micawber.” He began his active life as a lawyer’s
apprentice; but soon left this employment to become a reporter. This
occupation he followed from 1831 to 1836. His first book was entitled
“Sketches of London Society, by Boz.” This was followed, in 1837, by the
“Pickwick Papers,” a work which suddenly brought much fame to the
author. His other works followed with great rapidity, and his last was
unfinished at the time of his death. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.
Mr. Dickens visited America in 1842, and again in 1867. During his last
visit, he read his works in public, in the principal cities of the
United States.</p>
<p>The resources of Dickens’s genius seemed exhaustless. He copied no
author, imitated none, but relied entirely on his own powers. He
excelled especially in humor and pathos. He gathered materials for his
works by the most careful and faithful observation. And he painted his
characters with a fidelity so true to their different individualities
that, although they sometimes have a quaint grotesqueness bordering on
caricature, they stand before the memory as living realities. He was
particularly successful in the delineation of the joys and griefs of
childhood. “Little Nell” and little “Paul Dombey” are known, and have
been loved and wept over, in almost every household where the English
language is read. His writings present very vividly the wants and
sufferings of the poor, and have a tendency to prompt to kindness and
benevolence. His works have not escaped criticism. It has been said that
“his good characters act from impulse, not from principle,” and that he
shows “a tricksy spirit of fantastic exaggeration.” It has also been
said that his novels sometimes lack skillful plot, and that he seems to
speak approvingly of conviviality and dissipation. “The Old Curiosity
Shop,” from which the following extract is taken, was published in
1840.</p>
<p>She was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from trace of
pain, so fair to look upon. She seemed a creature fresh from the hand of
God, and waiting for the breath of life; not one who had lived, and
suffered death. Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter
berries and green leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to favor.
“When I die, put near me something that has loved the light, and had the
sky above it always.” These were her words.</p>
<p>She was dead. Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead. Her little
bird, a poor, slight thing the pressure of a finger would have crushed,
was stirring nimbly in its cage, and the strong heart of its child
mistress was mute and motionless forever! Where were the traces of her
early cares, her sufferings, and fatigues? All gone. Sorrow was dead,
indeed, in her; but peace and perfect happiness were born, imaged in her
tranquil beauty and profound repose.</p>
<p>And still her former self lay there, unaltered in this change. Yes!
the old fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face; it had passed,
like a dream, through haunts of misery and care; at the door of the poor
schoolmaster on the summer evening, before the furnace fire upon the
cold wet night, at the still bedside of the dying boy, there had been
the same mild and lovely look. So shall we know the angels, in their
majesty, after death.</p>
<p>The old man held one languid arm in his, and had the small hand tight
folded to his breast for warmth. It was the hand she had stretched out
to him with her last smile; the hand that had led him on through all
their wanderings. Ever and anon he pressed it to his lips; then hugged
it to his breast again, murmuring that it was warmer now, and, as he
said it, he looked in agony to those who stood around, as if imploring
them to help her.</p>
<p>She was dead, and past all help, or need of help. The ancient rooms
she had seemed to fill with life, even while her own was waning fast,
the garden she had tended, the eyes she had gladdened, the noiseless
haunts of many a thoughtful hour, the paths she had trodden, as it were,
but yesterday, could know her no more.</p>
<p>“It is not,” said the schoolmaster, as he bent down to kiss her on
the cheek, and gave his tears free vent, “it is not in this world that
heaven’s justice ends. Think what earth is, compared with the world to
which her young spirit has winged its early flight, and say, if one
deliberate wish, expressed in solemn tones above this bed, could call
her back to life, which of us would utter it?”</p>
<p>She had been dead two days. They were all about her at the time,
knowing that the end was drawing on. She died soon after daybreak. They
had read and talked to her in the earlier portion of the night; but, as
the hours crept on, she sank to sleep. They could tell by what she
faintly uttered in her dreams, that they were of her journeyings with
the old man; they were of no painful scenes, but of people who had
helped them, and used them kindly; for she often said “God bless you!”
with great fervor.</p>
<p>Waking, she never wandered in her mind but once, and that was at
beautiful music, which, she said, was in the air. God knows. It may have
been. Opening her eyes, at last, from a very quiet sleep, she begged
that they would kiss her once again. That done, she turned to the old
man, with a lovely smile upon her face, such, they said, as they had
never seen, and could never forget, and clung, with both her arms, about
his neck. She had never murmured or complained; but, with a quiet mind,
and manner quite unaltered, save that she every day became more earnest
and more grateful to them, faded like the light upon the summer’s
evening.</p>
<p>The child who had been her little friend, came there, almost as soon
as it was day, with an offering of dried flowers, which he begged them
to lay upon her breast. He told them of his dream again, and that it was
of her being restored to them, just as she used to be. He begged hard to
see her: saying, that he would be very quiet, and that they need not
fear his being alarmed, for he had sat alone by his young brother all
day long, when he was dead, and had felt glad to be so near him. They
let him have his wish; and, indeed, he kept his word, and was, in his
childish way, a lesson to them all.</p>
<p>Up to that time, the old man had not spoken once, except to her, or
stirred from the bedside. But, when he saw her little favorite, he was
moved as they had not seen him yet, and made as though he would have him
come nearer. Then, pointing to the bed, he burst into tears for the
first time, and they who stood by, knowing that the sight of this child
had done him good, left them alone together.</p>
<p>Soothing him with his artless talk of her, the child persuaded him to
take some rest, to walk abroad, to do almost as he desired him. And,
when the day came, on which they must remove her, in her earthly shape,
from earthly eyes forever, he led him away, that he might not know when
she was taken from him. They were to gather fresh leaves and berries for
her bed.</p>
<p>And now the bell, the bell she had so often heard by night and day,
and listened to with solemn pleasure, almost as a living voice, rung its
remorseless toll for her, so young, so beautiful, so good. Decrepit age,
and vigorous life, and blooming youth, and helpless infancy,—on
crutches, in the pride of health and strength, in the full blush of
promise, in the mere dawn of life, gathered round her. Old men were
there, whose eyes were dim and senses failing, grandmothers, who might
have died ten years ago, and still been old, the deaf, the blind, the
lame, the palsied, the living dead, in many shapes and forms, to see the
closing of that early grave.</p>
<p>Along the crowded path they bore her now, pure as the newly fallen
snow that covered it, whose day on earth had been as fleeting. Under
that porch, where she had sat when heaven, in its mercy, brought her to
that peaceful spot, she passed again, and the old church received her in
its quiet shade.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-460">中文阅读</h4>
<p>她死了。这是最为静美的睡眠，没有一丝苦痛，看上去楚楚动人。她犹如上帝刚刚亲手创造的生灵，等待着生命的气息；而并非曾经活在世上的人，又落入了死亡的魔掌。她的栖息之处撒满了冬青果和绿叶，都是从她以前喜爱的地方采摘而来的。“我死的时候，请让我靠近热爱光明的事物，且让它永远留在蓝天之下。”这就是她的遗言。</p>
<p>她死了。温柔可爱、耐心待人、心地高尚的耐儿死了。她的小鸟儿，那可怜的小东西，一个指头就可以把它捏碎，却仍然在它的笼子里轻快地跳跃，而它的小女主人那颗强壮的心，却了无声息，永远地停止了跳动！她早日的忧愁、苦痛和困乏去了哪里呢？都消失了。的确，她内心的悲伤永远消失了；而安详美满由此诞生，映照在她静谧的美丽和酣甜的睡梦之中。</p>
<p>她仍然躺在那儿，一如往昔的模样，并未因这样的变故而改变。是啊！昔日的炉火，在同一张甜美的脸庞上映出微笑。这脸庞如同幻梦般，穿越愁云惨雾的笼罩，在仲夏之夜来到那可怜的老师家门，在湿冷的夜晚靠在炉火前面，当那小男孩濒死之际静静地站在床边，就是这同一副温柔可爱的容颜。于是我们看到了高贵的天使——在它们离开这人间之后。</p>
<p>老人握着她一只软绵绵的胳膊，把那只蜷缩成团的小手贴在胸前暖着。就是这只手，她带着最后一抹笑容伸向他；就是这只手，在他们颠沛流离的生活里牵着他往前走。老人不时把这只手放在双唇上，又紧紧拥入怀中，喃喃地说着“它现在暖和点儿了”，边说边悲恸地看着簇拥在四周的人们，仿佛在哀求他们给予援助。</p>
<p>她死了，任何努力都已无济于事，她也不再需要了。那由于她的存在而充满生气的古旧房间——尽管她自己的生命却在迅速地凋谢；那个她悉心照料的花园；那一双双因为她而焕发喜悦的眼晴；那许多个静思的时辰里无言的徘徊；那走过的一条条小径；一切宛如昨日，但她已全然不知。</p>
<p>“不会的，”老师弯下腰亲吻她的脸颊，泪水不住地往下淌：“天国的正义不会在这世间了却。想想吧，她那年轻的灵魂张开翅膀飞往的世界，与这人间相比，是孰优孰劣？又倘若我们在这床前，真要特意用庄严的语调表白，就可以唤回她的生命，我们之中谁又有资格能开口呢？”</p>
<p>她离开人世两天了。她弥留之际，他们都在周围，清楚她要离开。日出后不久她就死了。前半夜，他们为她读书，跟她说话；然而随着时间分分秒秒地流逝，她渐渐沉入了梦乡。她在梦里发出微弱的呓语，他们能分辨出其中的内容，是说她正在和老人一道流浪的事，其中没有悲痛的场面，只有人们如何施以援手、如何仁慈；在梦里，她无比诚挚地反复念叨着：“上帝保佑你们！”</p>
<p>她醒着的时候，神智一直保持清醒，只有一次，她说空中飘过一阵优美的音乐。上帝才晓得。也许是真的。最后，她从安详的睡梦中醒来，睁开双眼，请求他们再次亲吻她。吻过之后，她转向老人，脸上浮现出动人的微笑。他们说，这笑容他们从未见过，也永不能忘怀。她就带着这样的笑容伸出双臂，紧紧环绕着老人的脖子。她从未有过任何怨言，只带着一颗宁静的心，举止从容不变，只是一天天地对他们更为诚挚和感恩，而她自己正如同夏日傍晚的阳光般渐渐消逝。</p>
<p>那个和她做了好朋友的孩子，天刚亮就赶来了，手里拿着一束干花，请求他们把花放在她的胸前。孩子又告诉他们自己所做的梦：她一如往日又回到大家中间。他苦苦哀求要看她一眼。他保证自己会安安静静的，他们也不必担心他会惊慌，因为他弟弟死的时候，他一整天都独自坐在弟弟身边，能如此亲密地陪伴着弟弟让他感到宽慰。他们应许了，于是孩子得偿所愿。孩子确实信守诺言，且以孩子特有的方式给他们都上了一课。</p>
<p>直到那时老人都不曾开口说话——除了对她以外，又在她的床边徘徊。然而，看到她亲密的小朋友，老人就被深深地打动了，那样子人们都未曾见过。他的神态似乎是想要孩子再靠近一些。随后，老人指了指床，眼里第一次涌出了泪水。站在一旁的人们知道看到这孩子能给老人带来些慰藉，于是就把他们单独留了下来。</p>
<p>孩子用天真无邪的话语谈论着耐儿，安慰着老人，借此说服他休息一会儿，走到外头去散散步。老人几乎都依了孩子的话。太阳升起了，人们必须把她抬走了，她这副尘世的躯壳，就要永远地离开那些世人的眼睛了。孩子领着老人到别处去，免得老人看着她从自己身边离开。人们采来了新鲜的树叶和浆果，给她铺好灵床。</p>
<p>而那钟声，那白天黑夜都会响起的钟声，她常常带着庄严的愉悦去聆听的钟声，几乎如同一把具有生命的声音，现在就要残忍地为她而敲响——这如此年轻、美丽而善良的小女孩。衰弱的老者，强壮的成年人，容光焕发的青年，懵懂无助的孩子——拄着拐杖的，以健壮身体为傲的，充满希望的红红脸蛋儿，还有那新生命伊始的，都簇拥在她周围。老爷爷在那儿，他们老眼昏花、感官衰退；老奶奶在那儿，十年前就该寿终正寝的，现在仍是一副老朽之躯；还有各式各样的聋子、盲人、瘸子以及行尸走肉的人们，都来见证那新坟垒起。他们抬着她，沿着挤满人的小径走来，她在人世的日子如此短暂，如今身上恰似覆盖一片落下的新雪，而她亦如同这雪花般纯洁。那门廊——上天曾慈悲地引领她去那平静之地，她从前常在底下安坐；如今她再次从那儿经过，让古老的教堂静静地把她拥入怀中。</p>

<p>VANITY OF LIFE</p>
<p>生之虚无 (1)</p>
<p>Johann Gottfried von Herder, 1744-1803, an eminent German poet,
preacher, and philosopher, was born in Mohrungen, and died in Weimar.
His published works comprise sixty volumes. This selection is from his
“Hebrew Poetry.”</p>
<p>Man, born of woman,</p>
<p>Is of a few days,</p>
<p>And full of trouble;</p>
<p>He cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down;</p>
<p>He fleeth also as a shadow,</p>
<p>And continueth not.</p>
<p>Upon such dost thou open thine eye,</p>
<p>And bring me unto judgment with thee?</p>
<p>Among the impure is there none pure?</p>
<p>Not one.</p>
<p>Are his days so determined?</p>
<p>Hast thou numbered his months,</p>
<p>And set fast his bounds for him</p>
<p>Which he can never pass?</p>
<p>Turn then from him that he may rest,</p>
<p>And enjoy, as an hireling, his day.</p>
<p>The tree hath hope, if it be cut down,</p>
<p>It becometh green again,</p>
<p>And new shoots are put forth.</p>
<p>If even the root is old in the earth,</p>
<p>And its stock die in the ground,</p>
<p>From vapor of water it will bud,</p>
<p>And bring forth boughs as a young plant.</p>
<p>But man dieth, and his power is gone;</p>
<p>He is taken away, and where is he?</p>
<p>Till the waters waste from the sea,</p>
<p>Till the river faileth and is dry land,</p>
<p>Man lieth low, and riseth not again.</p>
<p>Till the heavens are old, he shall not awake,</p>
<p>Nor be aroused from his sleep.</p>
<p>Oh, that thou wouldest conceal me</p>
<p>In the realm of departed souls!</p>
<p>Hide me in secret, till thy wrath be past;</p>
<p>Appoint me then a new term,</p>
<p>And remember me again.</p>
<p>But alas! if a man die</p>
<p>Shall he live again?</p>
<p>So long, then, as my toil endureth,</p>
<p>Will I wait till a change come to me.</p>
<p>Thou wilt call me, and I shall answer;</p>
<p>Thou wilt pity the work of thy hands.</p>
<p>Though now thou numberest my steps,</p>
<p>Thou shalt then not watch for my sin.</p>
<p>My transgression will be sealed in a bag,</p>
<p>Thou wilt bind up and remove my iniquity.</p>
<p>Yet alas! the mountain falleth and is swallowed up,</p>
<p>The rock is removed out of its place,</p>
<p>The waters hollow out the stones,</p>
<p>The floods overflow the dust of the earth,</p>
<p>And thus, thou destroyest the hope of man.</p>
<p>Thou contendest with him, till he faileth,</p>
<p>Thou changest his countenance, and sendeth him away.</p>
<p>Though his sons become great and happy,</p>
<p>Yet he knoweth it not;</p>
<p>If they come to shame and dishonor,</p>
<p>He perceiveth it not.</p>

<p>A POLITICAL PAUSE</p>
<p>政治性的暂时休战</p>
<p>Charles James Fox, 1749-1806, a famous English orator and statesman,
was the son of Hon. Henry Fox, afterward Lord Holland; he was also a
lineal descendant of Charles II. of England and of Henry IV, of France.
He received his education at Westminster, Eton, and Oxford, but left the
University without graduating. He was first elected to Parliament before
he was twenty years old. During the American Revolution, he favored the
colonies; later, he was a friend and fellow-partisan both with Burke and
Wilberforce. Burke said of him, “He is the most brilliant and successful
debater the world ever saw.” In his later years, Mr. Fox was as
remarkable for carelessness in dress and personal appearance, as he had
been for the opposite in his youth. He possessed many pleasing traits of
character, but his morals were not commendable; he was a gambler and a
spendthrift. Yet he exercised a powerful influence on the politics of
his times. This extract is from a speech delivered during a truce in the
long war between England and France.</p>
<p>“But we must pause,” says the honorable gentleman. What! must the
bowels of Great Britain be torn out, her best blood spilt, her treasures
wasted, that you may make an experiment? Put yourselves—Oh! that you
would put yourselves on the field of battle, and learn to judge of the
sort of horrors you excite. In former wars, a man might at least have
some feeling, some interest, that served to balance in his mind the
impressions which a scene of carnage and death must inflict.</p>
<p>But if a man were present now at the field of slaughter, and were to
inquire for what they were fighting—“Fighting!”, would be the answer;
“they are not fighting; they are pausing.” “Why is that man expiring?
Why is that other writhing with agony? What means this implacable fury?”
The answer must be, “You are quite wrong, sir, you deceive
yourself,—they are not fighting,—do not disturb them,—they are merely
pausing! This man is not expiring with agony,—that man is not dead,—he
is only pausing! Bless you, sir, they are not angry with one another;
they have now no cause of quarrel; but their country thinks that there
should be a pause. All that you see is nothing like fighting,—there is
no harm, nor cruelty, nor bloodshed in it; it is nothing more than a
political pause. It is merely to try an experiment—to see whether
Bonaparte will not behave himself better than heretofore; and, in the
meantime, we have agreed to a pause, in pure friendship!”</p>
<p>And is this the way that you are to show yourselves the advocates of
order? You take up a system calculated to uncivilize the world, to
destroy order, to trample on religion, to stifle in the heart not merely
the generosity of noble sentiment, but the affections of social nature;
and in the prosecution of this system, you spread terror and devastation
all around you.</p>

<p>“我们一定要暂时休战。”那位德高望重的绅士说。何其乃尔！一定要掏出大不列颠的心脏，让她高贵的子民鲜血飞溅，让她的珍宝白白消耗，这是你的一场实验吗？请你设身处地啊！请你自己亲自上战场，去评价一下因你煽动而起的那种种惨状。在过去的战争中，人至少还有些同情心，有点关怀之情，尽管受到了血腥屠杀、尸横遍野的景象刺激，至少不至于精神失常。</p>
<p>但如果现在有一个人置身于大屠杀的现场，你问他们为什么而战斗——“就是战斗！”这就是回答。“他们不是在战斗，他们是在暂时休战。”“为什么那人奄奄一息？还有另一个痛得满地打滚？这不共戴天的愤怒意味着什么？”回答一定是这样：“你错了，先生。你蒙蔽了自己的眼睛。他们不是在战斗，你不要打扰他们。他们只是暂时休战而已！这个人不是在垂死挣扎，那个人也没有死——他只是歇一歇！上帝保佑你，先生，他们并没有生对方的气，他们现在并没有什么理由不和，不过他们的国家希望他们歇一歇。你所看到的一切跟战争无关，这里面没有伤害，没有残酷，也没有血流成河，只不过就是一种策略性的暂时休战而已。仅仅是做了个实验，看看拿破仑·波拿巴是否比以往规矩一些；同时，我们两国同意暂时停战，友谊万岁！”</p>
<p>这就是你们表明自己是秩序拥护者的方式吗？你采用的制度故意破坏世界文明、摧毁秩序、践踏宗教，不只从根本上扼杀了“宽容”这种高贵的人类情感，而且还铲除了人们对社会本身的爱。你执行这个制度的时候，就是往周围散播恐惧、大肆破坏。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-16-4">LESSON 16</h2>
<p>MY EXPERIENCE IN ELOCUTION</p>
<p>我的演说经验之谈</p>
<p>John Neal. 1793-1876, a brilliant but eccentric American writer, was
born in Portland, Maine. He went into business, when quite young, in
company with John Pierpont, the well-known poet. They soon failed, and
Mr. Neal then turned his attention to the study of law. He practiced his
profession somewhat, but devoted most of his time to literature. For a
time he resided in England, where he wrote for “Blackwood’s Magazine”
and other periodicals. His writings were produced with great rapidity,
and with a purposed disregard of what is known as “classical
English.”</p>
<p>In the academy I attended, elocution was taught in a way I shall
never forget—never! We had a yearly exhibition, and the favorites of the
preceptor were allowed to speak a piece; and a pretty time they had of
it. Somehow I was never a favorite with any of my teachers after the
first two or three days; and, as I went barefooted, I dare say it was
thought unseemly, or perhaps cruel, to expose me upon the platform. And
then, as I had no particular aptitude for public speaking, and no relish
for what was called oratory, it was never my luck to be called up.</p>
<p>Among my schoolmates, however, was one—a very amiable, shy boy—to
whom was assigned, at the first exhibition I attended, that passage in
Pope’s Homer beginning with,</p>
<p>“Aurora, now, fair daughter of the dawn!”</p>
<p>This the poor boy gave with so much emphasis and discretion, that, to
me, it sounded like “O roarer!” and I was wicked enough, out of sheer
envy, I dare say, to call him “O roarer!”—a nickname which clung to him
for a long while, though no human being ever deserved it less; for in
speech and action both, he was quiet, reserved, and sensitive.</p>
<p>My next experience in elocution was still more disheartening, so that
I never had a chance of showing what I was capable of in that way till I
set up for myself. Master Moody, my next instructor, was thought to have
uncommon qualifications for teaching oratory. He was a large, handsome,
heavy man, over six feet high; and having understood that the first,
second, and third prerequisite in oratory was action, the boys he put in
training were encouraged to most vehement and obstreperous
manifestations. Let me give an example, and one that weighed heavily on
my conscience for many years after the poor man passed away.</p>
<p>Among his pupils were two boys, brothers, who were thought highly
gifted in elocution. The master, who was evidently of that opinion, had
a habit of parading them on all occasions before visitors and strangers;
though one bad lost his upper front teeth and lisped badly, and the
other had the voice of a penny trumpet. Week after week these boys went
through the quarrel of Brutus and Cassius, for the benefit of myself and
others, to see if their example would not provoke us to a generous
competition for all the honors.</p>
<p>How it operated on the other boys in after life I can not say; but
the effect on me was decidedly unwholesome—discouraging, indeed,—until I
was old enough to judge for myself, and to carry into operation a system
of my own.</p>
<p>On coming to the passage,—</p>
<p>“Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;</p>
<p>Dash him to pieces!“—</p>
<p>the elder of the boys gave it after the following fashion: “Be ready,
godths, with all your thunderbolths,—dath him in pietheth!”—bringing his
right fist down into his left palm with all his strength, and his lifted
foot upon the platform, which was built like a sounding-board, so that
the master himself, who had suggested the action and obliged the poor
boy to rehearse it over and over again, appeared to be utterly carried
away by the magnificent demonstration; while to me—so deficient was I in
rhetorical taste—it sounded like a crash of broken crockery,
intermingled with chicken peeps.</p>
<p>I never got over it; and to this day can not endure stamping, nor
even tapping of the foot, nor clapping the hands together, nor thumping
the table for illustration; having an idea that such noises are not
oratory, and that untranslatable sounds are not language.</p>
<p>My next essay was of a somewhat different kind. I took the field in
person, being in my nineteenth year, well proportioned, and already
beginning to have a sincere relish for poetry, if not for declamation. I
had always been a great reader; and in the course of my foraging
depredations I had met with “The Mariner’s Dream” and “The Lake of the
Dismal Swamp,” both of which I had committed to memory before I knew
it.</p>
<p>And one day, happening to be alone with my sister, and newly rigged
out in a student’s gown, such as the lads at Brunswick sported when they
came to show off among their old companions, I proposed to astonish her
by rehearsing these two poems in appropriate costume. Being very proud
of her brother, and very obliging, she consented at once,—upon condition
that our dear mother, who had never seen anything of the sort, should be
invited to make one of the audience.</p>
<p>On the whole, I rather think that I succeeded in astonishing both. I
well remember their looks of amazement—for they had never seen anything
better or worse in all their lives, and were no judges of acting—as I
swept to and fro in that magnificent robe, with outstretched arms and
uplifted eyes, when I came to passages like the following, where an
apostrophe was called for:</p>
<p>“And near him the she wolf stirred the brake,</p>
<p>And the copper snake breathed in his ear,</p>
<p>Till he, starting, cried, from his dream awake,</p>
<p>’Oh, when shall I see the dusky lake,</p>
<p>And the white canoe of my dear!’”</p>
<p>Or like this:</p>
<p>“On beds of green sea flowers thy limbs shall be laid;</p>
<p>Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow,</p>
<p>Of thy fair yellow locks, threads of amber be made,</p>
<p>And every part suit to thy mansion below;“—</p>
<p>throwing up my arms, and throwing them out in every possible
direction as the spirit moved me, or the sentiment prompted; for I
always encouraged my limbs and features to think for themselves, and to
act for themselves, and never predetermined, never forethought, a
gesture nor an intonation in my life; and should as soon think of
counterfeiting another’s look or step or voice, or of modulating my own
by a pitch pipe (as the ancient orators did, with whom oratory was
acting elocution, a branch of the dramatic art), as of adopting or
imitating the gestures and tones of the most celebrated rhetorician I
ever saw.</p>
<p>The result was rather encouraging. My mother and sister were both
satisfied. At any rate, they said nothing to the contrary. Being only in
my nineteenth year, what might I not be able to accomplish after a
little more experience!</p>
<p>How little did I think, while rehearsing before my mother and sister,
that anything serious would ever come of it, or that I was laying the
foundations of character for life, or that I was beginning what I should
not be able to finish within the next forty or fifty years following.
Yet so it was. I had broken the ice without knowing it. These things
were but the foreshadowing of what happened long afterward.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-463">中文阅读</h4>
<p>在我就读的学校里，老师教授演说术的方式我将永远也不会忘记——可以说，永生难忘！我们每年都有演讲才艺展示，导师让喜欢的几个学生讲上一段，而且还会留给他们充裕的时间。但不知为何，上了两三天学以后，就再也没有任何老师喜欢我了。而且，大概因为我平时是赤脚走路，所以他们认为把我暴露在讲台之上显得很不得体，甚或可以说是残忍。此外，我并没有什么公开演讲的天资，对所谓的演说术也不感兴趣；于是，我从来不会有幸被老师叫起来演讲。</p>
<p>而在我的同学之中就有一个这样的幸运儿。他是一个非常友善和害羞的男孩，在我参加第一次年度演讲展示中，老师指定他朗诵亚历山大·蒲伯的《荷马》节选，第一句如下：</p>
<p>“奥罗拉！曙光女神乍现，那美丽的黎明之女！”</p>
<p>这可怜的男孩字斟句酌，把每个音节都读得很重，在我听来那开头就像是喊“嗷嗷闹”一般。我那时太坏了，我敢说，我纯粹是出于妒忌，从此就管他叫“嗷嗷闹”，这绰号跟随了他很长一段时间，但他跟这个绰号真是八竿子打不着。无论是从他的言行还是举止来看，他都是一个沉默寡言、多愁善感的男孩。</p>
<p>我第二次关于演说的经历更让人沮丧，因此直到我自立门户，我从没有在人前展示我的演讲才能。穆迪先生是我的下一任老师，被认为在教授演说术方面本领非凡。他是个魁梧而英俊的男人，有六英尺高；他认为演说术的第一、第二、第三大先决条件都是肢体动作，因此他鼓励那些受训的男孩们演说时最大程度地展现热情，并做出种种喧闹的动作。让我举个例子吧，这个例子给我留下了极为深刻的印象，甚至在他去世多年以后我心里都记得清清楚楚。</p>
<p>他的学生中有两个男孩是兄弟俩，在演讲方面被认为是极有天赋。老师显然也持有相同想法，在所有场合之下，只要有来访者、陌生人在场，他就把这哥俩推出来炫耀一番。不过这哥俩一个掉了上门牙，说话咬舌得厉害；一个的嗓音就像是小号。数周以来，他们俩当着我和其他人的面，演绎布鲁特斯和卡修斯（两人都是罗马共和国的政治家）的争吵，看他们的争吵是否会刺激我们为了争夺“荣耀”而激烈地竞争。</p>
<p>我并不知道这对其他男孩今后的人生产生了怎样的影响，不过对我则断然是糟糕透顶——不瞒你说，简直是让我打消了学习这方面技艺的念头——直至我到了明辨是非的年龄，以自己的方式走上了演讲台。</p>
<p>演讲中有这一段：</p>
<p>“神灵啊，准备好了，用你的万钧雷霆，</p>
<p>把他碎尸万段！”</p>
<p>那哥哥是这样诵读的：“神灵啊呀，准备好了，用你的万钧雷霆呀，把他碎尸万段呀！”一边喊一边用尽全身力气，挥起右拳砸在左手上，同时左脚狠命跺一跺那本来就像传声板一般构造的讲台——于是，老师本人看起来是完全被这威武的动作打动了，而这正是他所设计的动作，且强迫这可怜的男孩排演了一遍又一遍。但对我来说——我这人的修辞品味有严重缺陷——这听起来就像是瓦器打碎的声音，间杂着小鸡吱吱叫。</p>
<p>我从未忘怀这景象，直到今天仍然不能忍受跺脚，甚至轻叩鞋底、拍手、描述事物时捶桌子。我觉得这些噪音不能算是演说术，这种无法翻译的声响也不能算是语言。</p>
<p>我的下一次演讲尝试则有些不同。在十九岁那年，我亲自登场了。那时我各方面充分准备，开始正儿八经地喜欢诗歌——也可能是喜欢激情演说。我向来都是一个出众的朗诵者，在大肆搜寻糟蹋对象的期间，我看到了《水手梦》和《凄泽之湖》，这两篇文章都是耳熟能详的，因此我不知不觉就把它们牢牢记住了。</p>
<p>有一天，恰好只有我和姐姐在一块儿，我又刚刚穿上了学袍，就像布伦茨维克的青年们遇到昔日伙伴时难免炫耀一番，我就向姐姐提议让我身穿正装背诵两首诗歌，我说这一定会让她大吃一惊。她一向以弟弟为荣，且为人体贴，马上就同意了；但她有个条件，因为我们亲爱的母亲从来没有见过这种场面，所以要把她请来作为观众。</p>
<p>总而言之，我的确让她们俩都大吃了一惊。我仍然记得她们莫名惊诧的样子——她们一生从未见过这样的场景，亦无从评价——而我正拖着那华丽的袍子走来走去，双臂高举，仰视天空——每次我读到像以下那些片段的时候，就要发出呼喊了：</p>
<p>“母狼在他身旁的草丛里穿梭，</p>
<p>铜头蛇在他耳边咝咝作响——</p>
<p>他瞪着眼睛大喊，从梦中惊醒，</p>
<p>’啊，我何日才能见到那幽暗的大湖，</p>
<p>和我朝思暮想的那只白木舟！’”</p>
<p>或者是这样：</p>
<p>“你的身体将安置在鲜绿的海底花园中，</p>
<p>你雪白的骨头周围会长出红色的珊瑚，</p>
<p>你漂亮的金黄色头发做了琥珀的纤维，</p>
<p>每一个部分都与你海底的华厦相符。”</p>
<p>我挥舞着手臂，随心所欲、随情所至地把手臂挥往各个方向；因为我总是愿意我的四肢和面容不要受我的控制，自发地思想和行动，我这一生里，绝不会早有谋划、绝不会事先考虑一个姿势或一个语调。我要尽快想到如何模仿他人的表情、步态或声音，或者通过音笛来调整我自己（古代的演说家就是这么做的，他们那时候的演说术就是表演演讲，属于戏剧艺术的一个分支），也要回想起我所见过的最著名的演说家，表现或模仿他们的姿势和语调。</p>
<p>结果相当令人振奋。我的母亲和姐姐都非常满意。无论如何，她们也没有表现出不满。我才十九岁，只要我再多一点点走上演讲台的经验，那可是前途不可限量呀！</p>
<p>在我母亲和姐姐跟前演讲时，我并未想过会因演讲获得什么重要的机遇，想过我是正在为我人生打下根基，想过我正在开创的事业将在未来的四五十年中持续下去。然而事实就是如此。我在浑然不觉的情况下打破了坚冰。这些事情只是为我很久以后的人生埋下了伏笔。</p>

<p>ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD</p>
<p>墓园挽歌</p>
<p>Thomas Gray, 1716-1771, is often spoken of as “the author of the
Elegy,”—this simple yet highly finished and beautiful poem being by far
the best known of all his writings. It was finished in 1749,—seven years
from the time it was commenced. Probably no short poem in the language
ever deserved or received more praise. Gray was born in London; his
father possessed property, but was indolent and selfish; his mother was
a successful woman of business, and supported her son in college from
her own earnings. The poet was educated at Eton and Cambridge; at the
latter place, he resided for several years after his return from a
continental tour, begun in 1739. He was small and delicate in person,
refined and precise in dress and manners, and shy and retiring in
disposition. He was an accomplished scholar in many fields of learning,
but left comparatively little finished work in any department. He
declined the honor of poet laureate; but, in 1769, was appointed
Professor of History at Cambridge.</p>
<p>The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,</p>
<p>The lowing herd winds slowly o’er the lea,</p>
<p>The plowman homeward plods his weary way,</p>
<p>And leaves the world to darkness and to me.</p>
<p>Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,</p>
<p>And all the air a solemn stillness holds,</p>
<p>Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,</p>
<p>And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:</p>
<p>Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower,</p>
<p>The moping owl does to the moon complain</p>
<p>Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,</p>
<p>Molest her ancient solitary reign.</p>
<p>Beneath those rugged elms, that yew tree’s shade,</p>
<p>Where heaves the turf in many a moldering heap,</p>
<p>Each in his narrow cell forever laid,</p>
<p>The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.</p>
<p>The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,</p>
<p>The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,</p>
<p>The cock’s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,</p>
<p>No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.</p>
<p>For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,</p>
<p>Or busy housewife ply her evening care;</p>
<p>No children run to lisp their sire’s return,</p>
<p>Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.</p>
<p>Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,</p>
<p>Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke:</p>
<p>How jocund did they drive their team afield!</p>
<p>How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!</p>
<p>Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,</p>
<p>Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;</p>
<p>Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile</p>
<p>The short and simple annals of the poor.</p>
<p>The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,</p>
<p>And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave,</p>
<p>Await alike, the inevitable hour:</p>
<p>The paths of glory lead but to the grave.</p>
<p>Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,</p>
<p>If Memory o’er their tomb no trophies raise;</p>
<p>Where, through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault,</p>
<p>The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.</p>
<p>Can storied urn, or animated bust,</p>
<p>Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?</p>
<p>Can Honor’s voice provoke the silent dust,</p>
<p>Or Flattery soothe the dull, cold ear of Death?</p>
<p>Perhaps, in this neglected spot is laid</p>
<p>Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;</p>
<p>Hands, that the rod of empire might have swayed,</p>
<p>Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre:</p>
<p>But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,</p>
<p>Rich with the spoils of time, did ne’er unroll;</p>
<p>Chill Penury repressed their noble rage,</p>
<p>And froze the genial current of the soul.</p>
<p>Full many a gem of purest ray serene,</p>
<p>The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear:</p>
<p>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</p>
<p>And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</p>
<p>Some village Hampden, that, with dauntless breast,</p>
<p>The little tyrant of his fields withstood,</p>
<p>Some mute, inglorious Milton here may rest,</p>
<p>Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country’s blood.</p>
<p>The applause of listening senates to command,</p>
<p>The threats of pain and ruin to despise,</p>
<p>To scatter plenty o’er a smiling land,</p>
<p>And read their history in a nation’s eyes,</p>
<p>Their lot forbade: nor, circumscribed alone</p>
<p>Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;</p>
<p>Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne.</p>
<p>And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,</p>
<p>The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,</p>
<p>To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,</p>
<p>Or heap the shrine of luxury and pride,</p>
<p>With incense kindled at the Muse’s flame.</p>
<p>Far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife,</p>
<p>Their sober wishes never learned to stray;</p>
<p>Along the cool, sequestered vale of life,</p>
<p>They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.</p>
<p>Yet even these bones, from insult to protect,</p>
<p>Some frail memorial still, erected nigh,</p>
<p>With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked,</p>
<p>Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.</p>
<p>Their name, their years, spelt by the unlettered Muse,</p>
<p>The place of fame and elegy supply;</p>
<p>And many a holy text around she strews,</p>
<p>That teach the rustic moralist to die.</p>
<p>For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,</p>
<p>This pleasing, anxious being e’er resigned,</p>
<p>Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,</p>
<p>Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind?</p>
<p>On some fond breast the parting soul relies,</p>
<p>Some pious drops the closing eye requires;</p>
<p>E’en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,</p>
<p>E’en in our ashes live their wonted fires.</p>
<p>For thee, who, mindful of the unhonored dead,</p>
<p>Dost in these lines their artless tale relate,</p>
<p>If chance, by lonely contemplation led,</p>
<p>Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,—</p>
<p>Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,</p>
<p>“Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn</p>
<p>Brushing, with hasty step, the dews away,</p>
<p>To meet the sun upon the upland lawn:</p>
<p>“There, at the foot of yonder nodding beech,</p>
<p>That wreathes its old, fantastic roots so high,</p>
<p>His listless length at noontide would he stretch,</p>
<p>And pore upon the brook that babbles by.</p>
<p>“Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,</p>
<p>Muttering his wayward fancies, he would rove;</p>
<p>Now, drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,</p>
<p>Or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love.</p>
<p>“One morn, I missed him on the customed hill,</p>
<p>Along the heath, and near his favorite tree:</p>
<p>Another came; nor yet beside the rill,</p>
<p>Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he:</p>
<p>“The next, with dirges due, in sad array</p>
<p>Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne:—</p>
<p>Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay</p>
<p>’Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.”</p>
<p>THE EPITAPH.</p>
<p>Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth,</p>
<p>A youth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown:</p>
<p>Fair Science frowned not on his humble birth,</p>
<p>And Melancholy marked him for her own.</p>
<p>Large was his bounty and his soul sincere,</p>
<p>Heaven did a recompense as largely send:</p>
<p>He gave to Misery (all he had) a tear;</p>
<p>He gained from Heaven (’t was all he wished) a friend.</p>
<p>No farther seek his merits to disclose,</p>
<p>Or draw his frailties from their dread abode</p>
<p>(There they alike in trembling hope repose),</p>
<p>The bosom of his Father, and his God.</p>

<p>他到远远的林间，笑中带着讽讥，</p>
<p>一边徘徊，一边低语他的异想天开；</p>
<p>又垂头丧气，脸色苍白，如无所归依，</p>
<p>又如顾虑重重，或深陷爱情的无望。</p>

<p>墓碑在那边埋于丛丛荆棘的石头之上。</p>
<p>墓志铭</p>

<p>并无名声与财富，</p>
<p>“学问”并未鄙弃他卑贱的出身，</p>
<p>忧伤地亲自为他做记述。</p>
<p>他慷慨大方，为人真诚，</p>
<p>上天也给他几乎相同的报答：</p>
<p>为他曾遭遇的不幸流下泪水，</p>
<p>他如愿以偿地获得了一位天堂的朋友。</p>
<p>不必再寻求他的优点向世人做展露，</p>
<p>也莫从他的藏污纳垢处把弱点揪出，</p>
<p>它们都在颤抖中希冀能得到安宁，</p>
<p>让他回到上帝——那天父的怀里。</p>

<p>TACT AND TALENT</p>
<p>机智与才能</p>
<p>Talent is something, but tact is everything. Talent is serious,
sober, grave, and respectable: tact is all that, and more too. It is not
a sixth sense, but it is the life of all the five. It is the open eye,
the quick ear, the judging taste, the keen smell, and the lively touch;
it is the interpreter of all riddles, the surmounter of all
difficulties, the remover of all obstacles. It is useful in all places,
and at all times; it is useful in solitude, for it shows a man into the
world; it is useful in society, for it shows him his way through the
world.</p>
<p>Talent is power, tact is skill; talent is weight, tact is momentum;
talent knows what to do, tact knows how to do it; talent makes a man
respectable, tact will make him respected; talent is wealth, tact is
ready money. For all the practical purposes, tact carries it against
talent ten to one.</p>
<p>Take them to the theater, and put them against each other on the
stage, and talent shall produce you a tragedy that shall scarcely live
long enough to be condemned, while tact keeps the house in a roar, night
after night, with its successful farces. There is no want of dramatic
talent, there is no want of dramatic tact; but they are seldom together:
so we have successful pieces which are not respectable, and respectable
pieces which are not successful.</p>
<p>Take them to the bar, and let them shake their learned curls at each
other in legal rivalry; talent sees its way clearly, but tact is first
at its journey’s end. Talent has many a compliment from the bench, but
tact touches fees. Talent makes the world wonder that it gets on no
faster, tact arouses astonishment that it gets on so fast. And the
secret is, that it has no weight to carry; it makes no false steps; it
hits the right nail on the head; it loses no time; it takes all hints;
and, by keeping its eye on the weathercock, is ready to take advantage
of every wind that blows.</p>
<p>Take them into the church: talent has always something worth hearing,
tact is sure of abundance of hearers; talent may obtain a living, tact
will make one; talent gets a good name, tact a great one; talent
convinces, tact converts; talent is an honor to the profession, tact
gains honor from the profession.</p>
<p>Take them to court: talent feels its weight, tact finds its way;
talent commands, tact is obeyed; talent is honored with approbation, and
tact is blessed by preferment. Place them in the senate: talent has the
ear of the house, but tact wins its heart, and has its votes; talent is
fit for employment, but tact is fitted for it. It has a knack of
slipping into place with a sweet silence and glibness of movement, as a
billiard ball insinuates itself into the pocket.</p>
<p>It seems to know everything, without learning anything. It has served
an extemporary apprenticeship; it wants no drilling; it never ranks in
the awkward squad; it has no left hand, no deaf ear, no blind side. It
puts on no look of wondrous wisdom, it has no air of profundity, but
plays with the details of place as dexterously as a well-taught hand
flourishes over the keys of the pianoforte. It has all the air of
commonplace, and all the force and power of genius.</p>

<p>才能是不可忽视，但机智更是不可或缺。才能是严肃认真地获取的，是受人尊敬的禀赋；而这些特点机智兼而有之，且内涵更广。机智并不是一种第六感觉，而好比是人那五种感觉的灵魂。它是锐利的眼睛，灵敏的耳朵，善于鉴赏的舌头，敏锐的鼻子和生气勃勃的触摸。它能破解所有难题，克服千辛万苦，移除一切障碍。无论何时何地，它都是得力助手：你孤独自处时，它能带你一窥万千世界；你融入社会时，它能引领你在世上立足。</p>
<p>才能是一种力量，机智是一种本领。才能带来影响，机智带来动力；才能知道目标，机智懂得完成目标之途径；才能让你德高望重，机智让你成为德高望重之人；才能是财富，机智是现金。从实用角度而言，才能不及机智的十分之一。把它们都带到剧场上，让它们在舞台上一决高下；才能会为你展现一出不至于过分沉重的悲剧，而机智则用它成功的滑稽剧让剧场里夜夜笙歌。世间并不缺乏戏剧性的才能或戏剧性的机智，但两者极少能合二为一：于是我们有卖座但并未赢得尊重的作品，也有赢得尊重而不卖座的作品。</p>
<p>把它们带到法庭之上：让它们在律法的竞争中向着对方甩动那有学问的卷发。才能对它的方向了然于心，但机智首先到达终点。才能博得了法官席上的多次称赞，但机智与打官司的费用休戚相关。才能让世界满足于发展现状，不敢想象还有前进空间，机智让世界惊奇它的日新月异。其中秘诀在于，机智不需背负任何重担，不会留下半点过失；它切中要害，雷厉风行，一点即通，并且总是留意着风向标，随时准备凭风借力。</p>
<p>把它们带到教堂里面：才能总是那些值得一听的事物，机智则肯定不缺听众。才能使人立足于世，机智让人创造人生。才能赢得交口称赞，机智博得伟大之名。才能让人心悦诚服，机智让人把信仰皈依。才能是加冕于所从事职业的荣耀，机智从职业中获得荣耀。</p>
<p>把它们带到宫廷之上：才能带来影响，机智大展所长。才能发号施令，机智令人服服帖帖。才能博得赞叹，机智赢得擢升。把它们带到议会里面：才能让听众倾耳聆听，机智俘获它们的心灵、获得他们的投票。才能适合工作，机智胜任工作。机智握有诀窍，它无声无息、从容不迫地滑行至目标之地，就如弹子球左右穿插、巧妙地落入袋中。</p>
<p>机智似乎不需研习即能洞晓一切。它无需见习，无需训练，亦从来不会被归入愚笨之列。它信手拈来，耳聪目明。它无需非凡之智的伪装，亦容不得故作高深，但所有细节都处理得恰如其分，就像一只训练有素的手在钢琴的琴键上跳舞。它的样子最是平淡无奇，它的威力却是无与伦比。</p>

<p>SPEECH BEFORE THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION</p>
<p>弗吉尼亚州制宪大会上的演讲</p>
<p>Patrick Henry, 1730-1799, was born in Hanover County, Virginia, He
received instruction in Latin and mathematics from his father, but
seemed to develop a greater fondness for hunting, fishing, and playing
the fiddle than for study. Twice he was set up in business, and twice
failed before he was twenty-four. He was then admitted to the bar after
six weeks’ study of the law. He got no business at first in his
profession, but lived with his father-in-law. His wonderful powers of
oratory first showed themselves in a celebrated case which he argued in
Hanover Courthouse, his own father being the presiding magistrate. He
began very awkwardly, but soon rose to a surprising height of eloquence,
won his case against great odds, and was carried off in triumph by the
delighted spectators. His fame was now established; business flowed in,
and he was soon elected to the Virginia Legislature. He was a delegate
to the Congress of 1774, and in 1775 made the prophetic speech of which
the following selection is a portion. It was his own motion that the
“colony be immediately put in a state of defense.” During the Revolution
he was, for several years, Governor of Virginia. In 1788 he earnestly
opposed the adoption of the Federal Constitution. When he died, he left
a large family and an ample fortune. In person, Mr. Henry was tall and
rather awkward, with a face stern and grave. When he spoke on great
occasions, his awkwardness forsook him, his face lighted up, and his
eyes flashed with a wonderful fire. In his life, he was good-humored,
honest, and temperate. His patriotism was of the noblest type; and few
men in those stormy times did better service for their country than
he.</p>
<p>It is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt
to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that
siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men,
engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to
be of the number of those, who, having eyes, see not, and having ears,
hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?
For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to
know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.</p>
<p>I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp
of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the
past; and, judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in
the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify
those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves
and the house? Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has
been lately received? Trust it not: it will prove a snare to your feet.
Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves, how
this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike
preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and
armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown
ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to
win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves. These are the
implements of war and subjugation,— the last arguments to which kings
resort.</p>
<p>I ask, gentlemen, what means this martial array, if its purpose be
not to force us into submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible
motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the world,
to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, she has
none. They are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are
sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British
ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them?
Shall we try argument? We have been trying that for the last ten years.
Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held
the subject up in every light in which it was capable; but it has been
all in vain.</p>
<p>Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall
we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech
you, deceive ourselves longer. We have done everything that could be
done, to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we
have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves at
the foot of the throne, and implored its interposition to arrest the
tyrannical bands of the ministry and parliament. Our petitions have been
slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and
insult; our supplications disregarded; and we have been spurned with
contempt from the foot of the throne.</p>
<p>In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace
and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to
be free; if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges
for which we have been so long contending; if we mean not basely to
abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and
which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious
object of our contest shall be obtained—we must fight! I repeat it, we
must fight! An appeal to arms and the God of Hosts, is all that is left
us.</p>
<p>They tell us that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an
adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or
the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a
British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather
strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of
effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the
delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and
foot? We are not weak, if we make a proper use of those means which the
God of nature hath placed in our power.</p>
<p>Three millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in
such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force
which our enemy can send against us. Besides, we shall not fight our
battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of
nations; and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The
battle is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active,
the brave. Besides, we have no election. If we were base enough to
desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no
retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged. Their
clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable;
and; let it come! I repeat it, let it come!</p>
<p>It is in vain to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry peace,
peace; but there is no peace. The war is actually begun. The next gale
that sweeps from the north, will bring to our ears the clash of
resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we
here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life
so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains
and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may
take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death.</p>

<p>人们总是沉浸在希望的幻影之中，这是再平常不过的事。面对着令人痛苦的现实，我们倾向于闭目不见，听着海上女妖塞壬（半人半鸟的海妖，常用歌声诱惑过路的航海者而使航船触礁毁灭）的歌声，直到她把我们变作畜生。智者正为了自由而进行艰苦卓绝的斗争，难道这就是他们的本色？有些人有眼无珠、有耳不闻，而成了那些只关心自己暂时得救的东西，难道我们打算加入他们的行列？对于我来说，无论心灵将承受怎样剧烈的痛楚，我愿意了解现实的全部。我要了解最坏的情况，并为此做好准备。</p>
<p>我只有一盏灯指引前进的路，那就是我的经验之灯。我只知道通过了解过去来判断未来的情况，而回顾过去，我想知道的是，各位先生抱着种种希望既聊以自慰、亦慰藉国会，而过去十年英国内阁的所作所为，是否证实了先生们的希望呢？难道我们最新的请愿书不是换回了一个阴险的微笑？没有信任，“信任”就是在你跟前铺设的圈套。不要让人当面给你一个亲吻，背后把你出卖。请你们扪心自问：这些人一边和蔼可亲地接过我们的请愿书，一边在我们的水域、我们的土地上到处筹备作战，这两者如何协调一致？难道爱与和解的事业必须用上军舰和部队？难道我们是如此不愿和解，逼得他们必须用武力赢回我们的爱戴？让我们不要再自欺欺人了。马上就要有战争和镇压——这就是君王们在争端中使出的最后一招了。</p>
<p>“尊敬的阁下，我想问，这番军事部署假如不是要强迫我们屈服，那它是为了什么？各位先生能指定其他可能的动机吗？难道大不列颠在这世界的一角有什么敌人，要集结这大批的海军和陆军？没有，她没有敌人。他们是冲着我们而来的：不可能冲着其他任何人。这些军事力量奉命前来，用英国政府锻造已久的枷锁束缚我们，叫我们动弹不得。我们有什么能去和他们对抗？我们应该试试论理吗？我们过去十年都在尝试。对此我们还有什么新办法吗？没有。我们已经想尽一切办法拖延这个问题，但一切都是徒劳。</p>
<p>我们应该低声下气、苦苦哀求吗？我们开出的条件还有哪条不是已经失效的？我恳求各位，让我们不要再继续欺骗自己了。为了避开即将到来的暴风雨，我们已经尽了一切努力。我们请愿，我们抗议，我们哀求，我们匍匐在王座前面请求国王介入，制止政府和国会对我们的残暴管制。我们的请愿不受重视；我们的抗议换来了更多的暴力和侮辱；我们的哀求无人理睬；我们在王座跟前受到了轻慢的拒绝。</p>
<p>在经历如此种种之后，我们要是还热切地希望和平与和解，就是徒劳无益的。所有希望都已成泡影。倘若我们希望得到自由，倘若我们决心保护那我们一直在争取的、神圣不可侵犯的权利，倘若我们不打算拙劣地放弃长久以来的伟大斗争——我们一直都告诫自己不要放弃、要坚持到光辉目标实现的那一天——我们就必须战斗！我再说一遍，我们必须战斗！求助战神、诉诸武力，这就是留给我们的唯一出路。</p>
<p>他们告诉我们说，我们是弱小的，无法与如此可怕的对手抗衡。然而我们什么时候才能变得强大起来呢？是下周还是明年？难道是我们完全被解除武装、每一户人家里都驻扎了一个英国士兵的时候？我们就靠优柔寡断、无所作为来集结力量吗？我们要懒洋洋地躺着，把那虚妄的希望紧抱不放，直到我们的敌人把我们的手脚牢牢绑住？我们并不弱小——倘若我们能好好利用自然之神赋予我们的力量。</p>
<p>三百万人民，为了自由的神圣大业武装起来。这是我们的祖国，我们在这样一个国家里面，无论我们的敌人派出怎样的武装力量来对付我们，都不可能把我们战胜。而且，我们也不是独自战斗。公平的上帝主宰着各国的命运，他会为我们召集为我们而战的朋友。这场战争不仅仅是取决于谁更强大，更取决于谁更警醒、更主动、更英勇。倘若要说我们不怀好意主动求战，那么现在想要退出战斗是为时已晚。他们已经造好了束缚我们的枷锁。波士顿的大地上也可听到那镣铐叮当作响！战争是无法避免了，那么就让它来吧！我再说一遍，让它来吧！</p>
<p>无需再粉饰太平了。尊敬的先生们也许还在呼吁着要和平、要和平，但和平是不存在的。战争实际上已拉开帷幕。下一场从北方扫荡而来的狂风，就会把武器撞击的锵锵之声送入我们耳朵！我们的同胞已奔赴战场！为什么我们还在这儿袖手旁观？先生们还在期盼什么？他们还能得到什么？难道以枷锁和奴役为代价换来的生命如此宝贵、和平如此甜美？阻止他们吧，全能的上帝！我不知道其他人会选择怎样的路，但对我来说，要么让我死，要么给我自由。</p>

<p>THE AMERICAN FLAG</p>
<p>国旗颂</p>
<p>Joseph Rodman Drake. 1795-1820, was born in New York City. His father
died when he was very young, and his early life was a struggle with
poverty. He studied medicine, and took his degree when he was about
twenty years old. From a child, he showed remarkable poetical powers,
having made rhymes at the early age of five. Most of his published
writings were produced during a period of less than two years. “The
Culprit Fay”and the “American Flag”are best known. In disposition,
Mr. Drake was gentle and kindly; and, on the occasion of his death, his
intimate friend, Fitz-Greene Halleck, expressed his character in the
well-known couplet:</p>
<p>“None knew thee but to love thee,</p>
<p>Nor named thee but to praise.”</p>
<p>When Freedom, from her mountain height,</p>
<p>Unfurled her standard to the air,</p>
<p>She tore the azure robe of night,</p>
<p>And set the stars of glory there:</p>
<p>She mingled with its gorgeous dyes</p>
<p>The milky baldric of the skies,</p>
<p>And striped its pure, celestial white</p>
<p>With streakings of the morning light;</p>
<p>Then, from his mansion in the sun,</p>
<p>She called her eagle bearer down,</p>
<p>And gave into his mighty hand</p>
<p>The symbol of her chosen land.</p>
<p>Majestic monarch of the cloud!</p>
<p>Who rear’st aloft thy regal form,</p>
<p>To hear the tempest trumpings loud,</p>
<p>And see the lightning lances driven,</p>
<p>When strive the warriors of the storm,</p>
<p>And rolls the thunder drum of heaven;—</p>
<p>Child of the sun! to thee ’t is given</p>
<p>To guard the banner of the free,</p>
<p>To hover in the sulphur smoke,</p>
<p>To ward away the battle stroke,</p>
<p>And bid its blendings shine afar,</p>
<p>Like rainbows on the cloud of war,</p>
<p>The harbingers of victory!</p>
<p>Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,</p>
<p>The sign of hope and triumph high!</p>
<p>When speaks the signal trumpet tone,</p>
<p>And the long line comes gleaming on,</p>
<p>Ere yet the lifeblood, warm and wet,</p>
<p>Has dimmed the glistening bayonet,</p>
<p>Each soldier’s eye shall brightly turn</p>
<p>To where thy sky-born glories burn,</p>
<p>And, as his springing steps advance,</p>
<p>Catch war and vengeance from the glance.</p>
<p>And when the cannon mouthings loud</p>
<p>Heave in wild wreaths the battle shroud,</p>
<p>And gory sabers rise and fall,</p>
<p>Like shoots of flame on midnight’s pall,</p>
<p>Then shall thy meteor glances glow,</p>
<p>And cowering foes shall sink beneath</p>
<p>Each gallant arm, that strikes below</p>
<p>That lovely messenger of death.</p>
<p>Flag of the seas! on ocean’s wave</p>
<p>Thy stars shall glitter o’er the brave;</p>
<p>When death careering on the gale,</p>
<p>Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,</p>
<p>And frighted waves rush wildly back,</p>
<p>Before the broadside’s reeling rack,</p>
<p>Each dying wanderer of the sea</p>
<p>Shall look at once to heaven and thee,</p>
<p>And smile to see thy splendors fly</p>
<p>In triumph o’er his closing eye.</p>
<p>Flag of the free heart’s hope and home,</p>
<p>By angel hands to valor given,</p>
<p>Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,</p>
<p>And all thy hues were born in heaven.</p>
<p>Forever float that standard sheet!</p>
<p>Where breathes the foe but falls before us,</p>
<p>With Freedom’s soil beneath our feet,</p>
<p>And Freedom’s banner streaming o’er us?</p>

<p>IRONICAL EULOGY ON DEBT</p>
<p>债务讽诵</p>
<p>Debt is of the very highest antiquity. The first debt in the history
of man is the debt of nature, and the first instinct is to put off the
payment of it to the last moment. Many persons, it will be observed,
following the natural procedure, would die before they would pay their
debts.</p>
<p>Society is composed of two classes, debtors and creditors. The
creditor class has been erroneously supposed the more enviable. Never
was there a greater misconception; and the hold it yet maintains upon
opinion is a remarkable example of the obstinacy of error,
notwithstanding the plainest lessons of experience. The debtor has the
sympathies of mankind. He is seldom spoken of but with expressions of
tenderness and compassion—“the poor debtor!”—and “the unfortunate
debtor!” On the other hand, “harsh” and “hard-hearted” are the epithets
allotted to the creditor. Who ever heard the “poor creditor,” the
“unfortunate creditor” spoken of? No, the creditor never becomes the
object of pity, unless he passes into the debtor class. A creditor may
be ruined by the poor debtor, but it is not until he becomes unable to
pay his own debts, that he begins to be compassionated.</p>
<p>A debtor is a man of mark. Many eyes are fixed upon him; many have
interest in his well-being; his movements are of concern; he can not
disappear unheeded; his name is in many mouths; his name is upon many
books; he is a man of note—of promissory note; he fills the speculation
of many minds; men conjecture about him, wonder about him,—wonder and
conjecture whether he will pay. He is a man of consequence, for many are
running after him. His door is thronged with duns. He is inquired after
every hour of the day. Judges hear of him and know him. Every meal he
swallows, every coat he puts upon his back, every dollar he borrows,
appears before the country in some formal document. Compare his
notoriety with the obscure lot of the creditor,—of the man who has
nothing but claims on the world; a landlord, or fundholder, or some such
disagreeable, hard character.</p>
<p>The man who pays his way is unknown in his neighborhood. You ask the
milkman at his door, and he can not tell his name. You ask the butcher
where Mr. Payall lives, and he tells you he knows no such name, for it
is not in his books. You shall ask the baker, and he will tell you there
is no such person in the neighborhood. People that have his money fast
in their pockets, have no thought of his person or appellation. His
house only is known. No. 31 is good pay. No. 31 is ready money. Not a
scrap of paper is ever made out for No. 31. It is an anonymous house;
its owner pays his way to obscurity. No one knows anything about him, or
heeds his movements. If a carriage be seen at his door, the neighborhood
is not full of concern lest he be going to run away. If a package be
removed from his house, a score of boys are not employed to watch
whether it be carried to the pawnbroker. Mr. Payall fills no place in
the public mind; no one has any hopes or fears about him.</p>
<p>The creditor always figures in the fancy as a sour, single man, with
grizzled hair, a scowling countenance, and a peremptory air, who lives
in a dark apartment, with musty deeds about him, and an iron safe, as
impenetrable as his heart, grabbing together what he does not enjoy, and
what there is no one about him to enjoy. The debtor, on the other hand,
is always pictured with a wife and six fair-haired daughters, bound
together in affection and misery, full of sensibility, and suffering
without a fault. The creditor, it is never doubted, thrives without a
merit. He has no wife and children to pity. No one ever thinks it
desirable that he should have the means of living. He is a brute for
insisting that he must receive, in order to pay. It is not in the
imagination of man to conceive that his creditor has demands upon him
which must be satisfied, and that he must do to others as others must do
to him. A creditor is a personification of exaction. He is supposed to
be always taking in, and never giving out.</p>
<p>People idly fancy that the possession of riches is desirable. What
blindness! Spend and regale. Save a shilling and you lay it by for a
thief. The prudent men are the men that live beyond their means. Happen
what may, they are safe. They have taken time by the forelock. They have
anticipated fortune. “The wealthy fool, with gold in store,” has only
denied himself so much enjoyment, which another will seize at his
expense. Look at these people in a panic. See who are the fools then.
You know them by their long faces. You may say, as one of them goes by
in an agony of apprehension, “There is a stupid fellow who fancied
himself rich, because he had fifty thousand dollars in bank.” The
history of the last ten years has taught the moral, “spend and regale.”
Whatever is laid up beyond the present hour, is put in jeopardy. There
is no certainty but in instant enjoyment. Look at schoolboys sharing a
plum cake. The knowing ones eat, as for a race; but a stupid fellow
saves his portion; just nibbles a bit, and “keeps the rest for another
time.” Most provident blockhead! The others, when they have gobbled up
their shares, set upon him, plunder him, and thrash him for crying
out.</p>
<p>Before the terms “depreciation,” “suspension,” and “going into
liquidation,” were heard, there might have been some reason in the
practice of “laying up;” but now it denotes the darkest blindness. The
prudent men of the present time, are the men in debt. The tendency being
to sacrifice creditors to debtors, and the debtor party acquiring daily
new strength, everyone is in haste to get into the favored class. In any
case, the debtor is safe. He has put his enjoyments behind him; they are
safe; no turns of fortune can disturb them. The substance he has eaten
up, is irrecoverable. The future can not trouble his past. He has
nothing to apprehend. He has anticipated more than fortune would ever
have granted him. He has tricked fortune; and his creditors—bah! who
feels for creditors? What are creditors? Landlords; a pitiless and
unpitiable tribe; all griping extortioners! What would become of the
world of debtors, if it did not steal a march upon this rapacious
class?</p>

<p>债务是我们由来已久、无上尊贵的文物。人类在历史上的第一桩债务就是欠了大自然的债，而人的第一本能就是把债务设法拖延到最后一刻。不难注意到，很多人都追随着自然规律，还未还清债款就已一命呜呼了。</p>
<p>社会由两大阶层构成：欠债人和债主。人们总是错误地以为债主阶层更令人羡慕的。这真是天大的误解。人们对此的固执己见可谓是一个范例，证明错误是如何根深蒂固，完全经不起最朴素的人生经验来考察。欠债人获得了人们的同情，人们谈起他时总是语带怜悯、温柔体贴——“那可怜的欠债人！”还有“那倒霉的欠债人！”而另一方面，“残酷无情”、“铁石心肠”则常常是指派给债主的诨号。有谁曾听说过有“可怜的债主”、“倒霉的债主”？没有。一个债主可能会毁于那可怜的欠债人之手，但只有到他无法偿还自己债务的时候，他才会得到人们的同情。</p>
<p>债主是标榜了某一类人。许多双眼睛注视着他，许多人都关心着他的幸福安康，他的一举一动都受到大家的关注，他的名字不可能被人忽略，总是挂在一张张嘴边，写在一个个本子上，他是万众期待的人物——“期”是“期票”的期。他成了人们心里揣测不已的对象，人们对他多番猜测、深感好奇——猜测和好奇他会不会还钱。他是一个举足轻重的人物，因为追赶他的人比比皆是。他的家门口挤满了前来催债的人。每天人们都不停地探听他的消息。法官们久仰他的大名，也认识他本人。他吃下的每一顿饭，他穿上的每件衣服，他借走的每一块钱，都写在某份正式文件里，清清楚楚地摊开在国人面前。相比他的臭名昭著，债主的命运可谓是寂寂无闻——他在世上除了债权以外便一无所有，他要不是个地主，要不就是个放债人，要不就是某些神憎鬼厌、难以对付的人物。</p>
<p>街坊邻居并不认识这么一个四处撒钱的人。你到送奶工家门口去问问，送奶工说不出来他姓甚名谁。你问问和“有借必给”先生同住一条街的屠夫，屠夫会说他并不知道这么一个人，因为他的账簿上并没有这个名字。你该去问问面包师傅，他会告诉你这附近没有住着这么一个人。那些飞快地把他的钱揣进自己口袋的人，他们根本没有想到他本身以及他的名字，只知道他家的门牌号码。31号是借钱的去处。31号是能借到钱的地方。没有哪一张小纸片是专门记着31号的。这是一栋籍籍无名的房子，它的主人花了大钱叫它被世人忘掉。没有人知道这主人的情况，也没有人在意他的行踪。要是有辆马车停在他家门口，除非是他要出逃，否则街坊邻居们并不怎么关心。要是从他家里抬出一个包裹，那群男孩也不会提得起兴趣去看看包裹是不是送到当铺老板那儿的。“有借必给”先生在公众心目中不占一点儿位置，无人对他抱有希望，亦无人对他心存畏惧。</p>
<p>人们总是把债主幻想成是一个乖戾的单身汉，头发斑白，脸色阴沉，举止专横霸道，住在一间阴黑的公寓里头，周围一堆发霉的借据，还有一个铁柜，如同他那颗心一样紧紧关闭，牢牢守着一堆东西——那些玩意儿他并不喜欢、跟他有牵扯的人也不乐见。而另一方面，欠债人在人们的心中，总是有一个妻子和六个头发暗黄的女儿，一家人相亲相爱，生活悲惨，感情细腻，没有做过一点儿坏事，却在困苦中苦苦挣扎。人们从不怀疑，债主只不过是个一无是处的发迹者。他没有妻儿供人同情。没有人想过他应该有别的谋生手段。他是个畜生，因为他坚持要人还钱——好负担他自己的生活。人们的脑海里从来无法想象，自己必须偿清债主所要求的债务，且和债主之间要做到“你待人当如人之待你”。债主就是敲诈勒索的代名词。人们认定他只会索求，从不给予。</p>
<p>人们想当然地以为，富人们拥有的一切令人羡慕。多么愚昧无知啊！这不过是花钱和逗人游戏罢了。一先令也存起来，等着小偷的光临。所谓精明人就是入不敷出的人。他们全凭侥幸才能安度一生。他们的时间都耗费在门锁之上。人人都觊觎他的财产。“富裕的傻瓜，库里藏金。”但挥霍钱财只是夺去了他的许多快乐，他的损失换回的是别人的高兴。看看这些惊惶失措的人吧，你就知道到底谁是傻瓜蛋了。看到他们拉长的脸，你就认出他们了。就像那众多忧心忡忡的旁观者一样，你可能也会说：“有个愚蠢的家伙竟以为自己很有钱，原因是他在银行存了五万美金。”</p>
<p>过去十年的历史让我们明白了花钱和逗人取乐的寓意。此刻不管贮存了什么东西，都是有危险的。一切都如过眼云烟，只有及时享乐而已。看看男生们怎么分享一块葡萄干饼吧。精明的孩子像比赛一样飞快吃掉，愚蠢的家伙就把他分得的糕饼留下来，只是咬一小口，“把剩下的留到下回吃”。多么有先见之明的傻子呀！其他人狼吞虎咽了他们那一份，就开始围攻他，要抢他的那一份，把他打得大哭起来。</p>
<p>在人们听说“贬值”、“暂停借贷”、“债务清偿”这些术语之前，可能还有些理由去践行“储蓄”。但如今“储蓄”意味着愚昧得无可救药。现今的聪明人就是那些欠债的人。潮流就是债主为欠债人舍命奉献，欠债人的队伍每天都在汲取新的力量，每个人都匆忙地准备跻身到“特权阶层”里头去。无论如何，欠债人是高枕无忧的，他没有什么可享受的，也没有什么财产的变故能让他们烦心。他耗尽了一切，已经无法挽回。过去不会困扰他的未来。他无所畏惧。他已经用骗术获得了财富，还欺骗了他的债主们——呸！谁会为债主着想？什么是债主？那些地主啊，那一类人毫无怜悯之心、也不值得别人同情，那些就知道勒索人的守财奴！欠债人要是不偷偷地占这个贪婪的阶层的便宜，他们的世界难道还不翻了天吗？</p>

<p>THE THREE WARNINGS</p>
<p>三个警告</p>
<p>Hester Lynch Thrale. 1739—1821, owes her celebrity almost wholly to
her long intimacy with Dr. Samuel Johnson. This continued for twenty
years, during which Johnson spent much time in her family. She was born
in Caernarvonshire, Wales; her first husband was a wealthy brewer, by
whom she had several children. In 1784, she married an Italian teacher
of music named Piozzi. Her writings are quite numerous; the best known
of her books is the “Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson;” but nothing she ever
wrote is so well known as the “Three Warnings.”</p>
<p>The tree of deepest root is found</p>
<p>Least willing still to quit the ground;</p>
<p>’T was therefore said by ancient sages,</p>
<p>That love of life increased with years</p>
<p>So much, that in our latter stages,</p>
<p>When pains grow sharp, and sickness rages,</p>
<p>The greatest love of life appears.</p>
<p>This great affection to believe,</p>
<p>Which all confess, but few perceive,</p>
<p>If old assertions can’t prevail,</p>
<p>Be pleased to hear a modern tale.</p>
<p>When sports went round, and all were gay,</p>
<p>On neighbor Dodson’s wedding day,</p>
<p>Death called aside the jocund groom</p>
<p>With him into another room;</p>
<p>And looking grave, “You must,” says he,</p>
<p>“Quit your sweet bride, and come with me.”</p>
<p>“With you! and quit my Susan’s side?</p>
<p>With you!” the hapless bridegroom cried:</p>
<p>“Young as I am, ’t is monstrous hard!</p>
<p>Besides, in truth, I’m not prepared.”</p>
<p>What more he urged, I have not heard;</p>
<p>His reasons could not well be stronger:</p>
<p>So Death the poor delinquent spared,</p>
<p>And left to live a little longer.</p>
<p>Yet, calling up a serious look,</p>
<p>His hourglass trembled while he spoke:</p>
<p>“Neighbor,” he said, “farewell! no more</p>
<p>Shall Death disturb your mirthful hour;</p>
<p>And further, to avoid all blame</p>
<p>Of cruelty upon my name,</p>
<p>To give you time for preparation,</p>
<p>And fit you for your future station,</p>
<p>Three several warnings you shall have</p>
<p>Before you’re summoned to the grave;</p>
<p>Willing for once I’ll quit my prey,</p>
<p>And grant a kind reprieve;</p>
<p>In hopes you’ll have no more to say,</p>
<p>But, when I call again this way,</p>
<p>Well pleased the world will leave.”</p>
<p>To these conditions both consented,</p>
<p>And parted perfectly contented.</p>
<p>What next the hero of our tale befell,</p>
<p>How long he lived, how wisely, and how well,</p>
<p>It boots not that the Muse should tell;</p>
<p>He plowed, he sowed, he bought, he sold,</p>
<p>Nor once perceived his growing old,</p>
<p>Nor thought of Death as near;</p>
<p>His friends not false, his wife no shrew,</p>
<p>Many his gains, his children few,</p>
<p>He passed his hours in peace.</p>
<p>But, while he viewed his wealth increase,</p>
<p>While thus along life’s dusty road,</p>
<p>The beaten track, content he trod,</p>
<p>Old Time, whose haste no mortal spares,</p>
<p>Uncalled, unheeded, unawares,</p>
<p>Brought on his eightieth year.</p>
<p>And now, one night, in musing mood,</p>
<p>As all alone he sate,</p>
<p>The unwelcome messenger of Fate</p>
<p>Once more before him stood.</p>
<p>Half-killed with wonder and surprise,</p>
<p>“So soon returned!” old Dodson cries.</p>
<p>“So soon d’ ye call it?” Death replies:</p>
<p>“Surely! my friend, you’re but in jest;</p>
<p>Since I was here before,</p>
<p>’T is six and thirty years at least,</p>
<p>And you are now fourscore.”</p>
<p>“So much the worse!” the clown rejoined;</p>
<p>“To spare the aged would be kind:</p>
<p>Besides, you promised me three warnings,</p>
<p>Which I have looked for nights and mornings!”</p>
<p>“I know,” cries Death, “that at the best,</p>
<p>I seldom am a welcome guest;</p>
<p>But do n’t be captious, friend; at least,</p>
<p>I little thought that you’d be able</p>
<p>To stump about your farm and stable;</p>
<p>Your years have run to a great length,</p>
<p>Yet still you seem to have your strength.”</p>
<p>“Hold!” says the farmer, “not so fast!</p>
<p>I have been lame, these four years past.”</p>
<p>“And no great wonder,” Death replies,</p>
<p>“However, you still keep your eyes;</p>
<p>And surely, sir, to see one’s friends,</p>
<p>For legs and arms would make amends.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” says Dodson, “so it might,</p>
<p>But latterly I’ve lost my sight.”</p>
<p>“This is a shocking story, faith;</p>
<p>But there’s some comfort still,” says Death;</p>
<p>“Each strives your sadness to amuse;</p>
<p>I warrant you hear all the news.”</p>
<p>“There’s none,” cries he, “and if there were,</p>
<p>I’ve grown so deaf, I could not hear.”</p>
<p>“Nay, then,” the specter stern rejoined,</p>
<p>“These are unpardonable yearnings;</p>
<p>If you are lame, and deaf, and blind,</p>
<p>You’ve had your three sufficient warnings,</p>
<p>So, come along; no more we’ll part.”</p>
<p>He said, and touched him with his dart:</p>
<p>And now old Dodson, turning pale,</p>
<p>Yields to his fate—so ends my tale.</p>

<p>你看那根基最深的老树，</p>
<p>最不情愿与那大地分离。</p>
<p>因此先哲有言，</p>
<p>对生活的爱随年岁渐增，</p>
<p>到了我们的晚年，</p>
<p>当苦痛渐长，疾病缠身，</p>
<p>对生活的眷恋越甚。</p>
<p>相信这种深情，</p>
<p>很少人觉察，尽管大家都承认，</p>
<p>要是古老的哲言无法说服你，</p>
<p>那就请聆听一个现代的故事。</p>
<p>人们全都在消遣作乐，</p>
<p>这天是邻人多德森大婚，</p>
<p>死神叫走了快乐的新郎，</p>
<p>与他一道进了另一间房。</p>
<p>死神一脸阴沉：“你必须——”</p>
<p>“离开你亲爱的新娘，随我而去。”</p>
<p>“跟你走！离开我的苏珊？”</p>
<p>“跟你走！”不幸的新郎哭喊：</p>
<p>“我还这样年轻，这怎么能承受！</p>
<p>且说实话，我是全无准备。”</p>
<p>他又极力哀求了什么，我并无听闻；</p>
<p>他的理由极为充分：</p>
<p>于是死神宽恕了这可怜的罪人，</p>
<p>让他得以继续生存。</p>
<p>不过他摆出了一副严肃的表情，</p>
<p>说话间计算时间的沙漏开始颤抖：</p>
<p>“兄弟，”他说，“那就再见了，</p>
<p>不要再让死亡烦扰你欢乐的时光，</p>
<p>此外，为了避免</p>
<p>指责我的残忍，玷污我的名声，</p>
<p>为了给你时间做好准备，</p>
<p>好在将来收你上天堂，</p>
<p>你会得到三次警告，</p>
<p>在你被召入坟墓之前。</p>
<p>我就答应，</p>
<p>开恩暂缓你的时日，</p>
<p>愿你将来没有怨言，</p>
<p>不过，当我再来如此呼唤，</p>
<p>你要兴高采烈地离开人间。”</p>
<p>双方都同意这些条件，</p>
<p>心满意足地就此分别。</p>
<p>接下来有何经历，我们的英雄，</p>
<p>他活了多久，是否明智，过得有多好，</p>
<p>这不由诗神缪斯来把故事道。</p>
<p>他开垦，他播种，他买来又卖走，</p>
<p>从不曾察觉到自己日渐老态龙钟，</p>
<p>从未想过死神已经在身边逼近。</p>
<p>他并未选错朋友，他的妻子也很温柔，</p>
<p>他挣得很多，孩子花得很少，</p>
<p>他安宁地过着他的年岁。</p>
<p>然而，当他目睹着他财富的累积，</p>
<p>沿着人生那满是坎坷的道路，</p>
<p>满足于来路上的一个个足印，</p>
<p>步履匆匆来的老年，没有凡人能够避免，</p>
<p>并未邀约，不知不觉，</p>
<p>迎来了他人生的第八十年。</p>
<p>这一个夜晚，陷入沉思冥想，</p>
<p>他享受着一个人的时光。</p>
<p>命运的使者不请自来，</p>
<p>再次站在了他的面前。</p>
<p>老多德森哭喊：“这么快就回来！”</p>
<p>死神回答：“你还要说快？”</p>
<p>“我的朋友，你当然只是开玩笑而已；</p>
<p>从我上次在这儿算起，</p>
<p>至少有三十六个年头过去，</p>
<p>你现在已经八十高龄。”</p>
<p>“只是越来越糟糕！”那“开玩笑”的人答道。</p>
<p>“宽恕了老人，会显出你的慈爱，</p>
<p>此外，你还答应给我三个警告，</p>
<p>我日日夜夜都在等待！”</p>
<p>“我也知道，”死神咆哮，</p>
<p>“我向来不是受欢迎的客人，</p>
<p>朋友，但你也不必挑剔，</p>
<p>至少我从未想到你能熬过，</p>
<p>农场和马厩里的辛苦活儿，</p>
<p>你的年寿已大长，</p>
<p>而你看来仍是身强力壮。”</p>
<p>“等等！”农夫说：“不要这么快！</p>
<p>这过去的四年我已瘸了腿。”</p>
<p>死神回答：“这并不奇怪，</p>
<p>但你的眼睛还好用，</p>
<p>先生，当然能看见你的朋友，</p>
<p>把胳膊和腿脚的毛病抵偿。”</p>
<p>“也许，”多德森说，“你说得对，</p>
<p>但最近我的视力已模糊。”</p>
<p>“你说的让人震惊，忠实的朋友，</p>
<p>但还是有些值得宽慰的事情，”死神说，</p>
<p>“保证你所听到的全部消息，</p>
<p>每条都能让你忘掉悲伤、展露欢颜。”</p>
<p>“一条都没有，”他大喊,“即使是有，</p>
<p>我也听不见，我已经失聪。”</p>
<p>“那么就是没有，”那幽灵沉下脸回答，</p>
<p>“这就是无法宽恕的渴望——</p>
<p>要是你跛脚、眼盲、失聪，</p>
<p>你就已全部收到三个警告，</p>
<p>跟我走吧，我们从此不再分开。”</p>
<p>他边说边往他身上掷去飞镖，</p>
<p>于是老多德森脸色发白，</p>
<p>向命运低下头来——我的故事就此完结。</p>

<p>THE MEMORY OF OUR FATHERS</p>
<p>缅怀先辈</p>
<p>Lyman Beecher, 1775-1863, a famous congregational minister of New
England, was born in New Haven, graduated from Yale College in 1797, and
studied theology with Dr. Timothy Dwight. His first settlement was at
East Hampton, L. I., at a salary of three hundred dollars per year. He
was pastor of the church in Litchfield, Ct., from 1810 till 1826, when
he removed to Boston, and took charge of the Hanover Street Church. In
the religious controversies of the time, Dr. Beecher was one of the most
prominent characters. From 1832 to 1842, he was President of Lane
Theological Seminary, in the suburbs of Cincinnati. He then returned to
Boston, where he spent most of the closing years of his long and active
life. His death occurred in Brooklyn, N. Y. As a theologian, preacher,
and advocate of education, temperance, and missions, Dr. Beecher
occupied a very prominent place for nearly half a century. He left a
large family of sons and two daughters, who are well known as among the
most eminent preachers and authors in America.</p>
<p>We are called upon to cherish with high veneration and grateful
recollections, the memory of our fathers. Both the ties of nature and
the dictates of policy demand this. And surely no nation had ever less
occasion to be ashamed of its ancestry, or more occasion for gratulation
in that respect; for while most nations trace their origin to
barbarians, the foundations of our nation were laid by civilized men, by
Christians. Many of them were men of distinguished families, of powerful
talents, of great learning and of preeminent wisdom, of decision of
character, and of most inflexible integrity. And yet not unfrequently
they have been treated as if they had no virtues; while their sins and
follies have been sedulously immortalized in satirical anecdote.</p>
<p>The influence of such treatment of our fathers is too manifest. It
creates and lets loose upon their institutions, the vandal spirit of
innovation and overthrow; for after the memory of our father shall have
been rendered contemptible, who will appreciate and sustain their
institutions? “The memory of our fathers”should be the watchword of
liberty throughout the land; for, imperfect as they were, the world
before had not seen their like, nor will it soon, we fear, behold their
like again. Such models of moral excellence, such apostles of civil and
religious liberty, such shades of the illustrious dead looking down upon
their descendants with approbation or reproof, according as they follow
or depart from the good way, constitute a censorship inferior only to
the eye of God; and to ridicule them is national suicide.</p>
<p>The doctrines of our fathers have been represented as gloomy,
superstitious, severe, irrational, and of a licentious tendency. But
when other systems shall have produced a piety as devoted, a morality as
pure, a patriotism as disinterested, and a state of society as happy, as
have prevailed where their doctrines have been most prevalent, it may be
in season to seek an answer to this objection.</p>
<p>The persecutions instituted by our fathers have been the occasion of
ceaseless obloquy upon their fair fame. And truly, it was a fault of no
ordinary magnitude, that sometimes they did persecute. But let him whose
ancestors were not ten times more guilty, cast the first stone, and the
ashes of our fathers will no more be disturbed. Theirs was the fault of
the age, and it will be easy to show that no class of men had, at that
time, approximated so nearly to just apprehensions of religious liberty;
and that it is to them that the world is now indebted for the more just
and definite views which now prevail.</p>
<p>The superstition and bigotry of our fathers are themes on which some
of their descendants, themselves far enough from superstition, if not
from bigotry, have delighted to dwell. But when we look abroad, and
behold the condition of the world, compared with the condition of New
England, we may justly exclaim, “Would to God that the ancestors of all
the nations had been not only almost, but altogether such bigots as our
fathers were.”</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-470">中文阅读</h4>
<p>我们在此响应上帝的号召，以崇高的敬意和感恩的心情缅怀我们的先辈。天性的纽带、理智的驱使，都要求我们这样做。无疑，相较其他国家而言，我们的国家为祖先感到羞耻的时候不多，而为他们感到骄傲的理由充分。因为绝大多数国家以野蛮人起源，而我们的祖国是由文明人、由基督徒所创立的。这些人中有许多出身显赫、才能非凡、学识渊博、智慧超群、坚决果断，而且有着不可动摇的正直。然而把他们当作一无是处的例子并不少见，那些具有讽刺意味的奇闻轶事口耳相传，让他们的过错和失误流传至今。</p>
<p>如此对待我们先辈所产生的后果显而易见。这为他们所创立的制度带来了疏漏，严重打击、甚至颠覆了创新的精神。要是缅怀我们的先辈被当作令人不齿的事，谁还会尊重并维护他们所创立的制度？“缅怀先辈”应该成为这片土地上代表自由的口号，因为尽管先辈们并非完人，但过往的世界里并未曾见到有谁能与之媲美，而在未来，大概也不容易随随便便就能找到这样的人。他们是美德的典范，是文明与宗教自由的传教先驱；这些显赫的先辈之魂，将根据后辈们沿袭亦或违背正道而许之以赞许亦或责备，他们创立的是一个至高无上、只受制于上帝的审查制度。嘲笑他们就是民族性的自杀。</p>
<p>我们一向把先辈的信条描绘成是蒙昧、迷信、纯朴、非理性和具有淫乱倾向的。然而，要是其他种种制度能塑造这样对神的虔敬之心，这样纯洁无瑕的品德，这样毫无私心的爱国主义，以及在信条的深入人心之下这样幸福的社会现状，那么上述描述也许才能称其为恰当。</p>
<p>我们的先辈对其他人所施加的宗教迫害，一直都是他们名誉上的污点。毋庸置疑，他们确实在某些时候迫害了他人，这是一个无法轻描淡写的过错。但是只有那些自家祖先无比清白的人，才有权力指责我们的祖先（由于那样的人根本不存在），所以我们的先辈完全可以不受惊扰。先辈们的过错是时代所造成的，极似对宗教自由的恐惧，而正由于他们的努力，更公正的、更确切的观念，才有幸流行于今天的世界。</p>
<p>有些后人习惯谈论先辈们的迷信与偏执，而他们本身就非常迷信，甚至非常偏执，而且安于此道。然而要是我们放眼世界，看看世界上的情形，与新英格兰的情况做个比较，我们就大致可以公正地呼唤：“上帝作证，所有民族的祖先都是偏执的，几乎和我们的先辈一样——不，应该说是一模一样。”</p>

<p>SHORT SELECTIONS IN PROSE</p>
<p>散文节选</p>
<p>I. DRYDEN AND POPE.</p>
<p>Dryden knew more of man in his general nature, and Pope in his local
manners. The notions of Dryden were formed by comprehensive speculation,
those of Pope by minute attention. There is more dignity in the
knowledge of Dryden, more certainty in that of Pope. The style of Dryden
is capricious and varied, that of Pope cautious and uniform. Dryden
obeys the motions of his own mind; Pope constrains his mind to his own
rules of composition. Dryden’s page is a natural field, rising into
inequalities, and diversified by the varied exuberance of abundant
vegetation; Pope’s is the velvet lawn, shaven by the scythe, and leveled
by the roller. If the flights of Dryden are higher, Pope continues
longer on the wing. If, of Dryden’s fire, the blaze is brighter, of
Pope’s the heat is more regular and constant. Dryden often surpasses
expectation, and Pope never falls below it. Dryden is read with frequent
astonishment, and Pope with perpetual delight.</p>

<li>LAS CASAS DISSUADING FROM BATTLE.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is then the dreadful measure of your cruelty not yet complete?
Battle! against whom? Against a king, in whose mild bosom your atrocious
injuries, even yet, have not excited hate; but who, insulted or
victorious, still sues for peace. Against a people, who never wronged
the living being their Creator formed; a people, who received you as
cherished guests, with eager hospitality and confiding kindness.
Generously and freely did they share with you their comforts, their
treasures, and their homes; you repaid them by fraud, oppression, and
dishonor.</p>
<p>Pizarro, hear me! Hear me, chieftains! And thou, All-powerful! whose
thunder can shiver into sand the adamantine rock, whose lightnings can
pierce the core of the riven and quaking earth, oh let thy power give
effect to thy servant’s words, as thy Spirit gives courage to his will!
Do not, I implore you, chieftains,—do not, I implore, you, renew the
foul barbarities your insatiate avarice has inflicted on this wretched,
unoffending race. But hush, my sighs! fall not, ye drops of useless
sorrow! heart-breaking anguish, choke not my utterance.</p>

<li>ACTION AND REPOSE.</li>
</ol>
<p>John Ruskin, 1819—, is a distinguished English art critic and author.
From 1869 to 1884, he was Professor of the Fine Arts at Oxford
University. His writings are very numerous, and are noted for their
eloquent and brilliant style.</p>
<p>About the river of human life there is a wintry wind, though a
heavenly sunshine; the iris colors its agitation, the frost fixes upon
its repose. Let us beware that our rest become not the rest of stones,
which, so long as they are tempest-tossed and thunderstricken, maintain
their majesty; but when the stream is silent and the storm passed,
suffer the grass to cover them, and are plowed into the dust.</p>
<ol start="4" type="I">
<li>TIME AND CHANGE.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sir Humphry Davy, 1778-1829, was an eminent chemist of England. He
made many important chemical discoveries, and was the inventor of the
miner’s safety lamp.</p>
<p>Time is almost a human word, and Change entirely a human idea; in the
system of nature, we should rather say progress than change. The sun
appears to sink in the ocean in darkness, but it rises in another
hemisphere; the ruins of a city fall, but they are often used to form
more magnificent structures: even when they are destroyed so as to
produce only dust, Nature asserts her empire over them; and the
vegetable world rises in constant youth, in a period of annual
successions, by the labors of man—providing food, vitality, and
beauty—upon the wrecks of monuments which were raised for the purposes
of glory, but which are now applied to objects of utility.</p>
<p>V. THE POET.</p>
<p>William Ellery Channing, 1780-1842, was a distinguished clergyman and
orator. He took a leading part in the public affairs of his day, and
wrote and lectured eloquently on several topics.</p>
<p>It is not true that the poet paints a life which does not exist. He
only extracts and concentrates, as it were, life’s ethereal essence,
arrests and condenses its volatile fragrance, brings together its
scattered beauties, and prolongs its more refined but evanescent joys;
and in this he does well, for it is good to feel that life is not wholly
usurped by cares for subsistence and physical gratifications, but
admits, in measures which may be indefinitely enlarged, sentiments and
delights worthy of a higher being.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li>MOUNTAINS.</li>
</ol>
<p>William Howitt, 1795-1879, was an English author. He published many
books, and was associated with his wife, Mary Howitt, in the publication
of many others.</p>
<p>There is a charm connected with mountains, so powerful that the
merest mention of them, the merest sketch of their magnificent features,
kindles the imagination, and carries the spirit at once into the bosom
of their enchanted regions. How the mind is filled with their vast
solitude! How the inward eye is fixed on their silent, their sublime,
their everlasting peaks! How our hearts bound to the music of their
solitary cries, to the tinkle of their gushing rills, to the sound of
their cataracts! How inspiriting are the odors that breathe from the
upland turf, from the rock-hung flower, from the hoary and solemn pine!
How beautiful are those lights and shadows thrown abroad, and that fine,
transparent haze which is diffused over the valleys and lower slopes, as
over a vast, inimitable picture!</p>

<p>难道你用来展示残暴的可怕行径还未曾结束吗？战斗！要与谁开战？要攻打那个国王——你已在他温柔的胸膛狠狠地插了一刀，而即便是这样，你也没有招来仇恨；他受到了你的侮辱，他仍然处于上风，却仍然想和你握手言和。你要攻打那个地方的人民——他们从未辜负造物主赋予他们的生命，他们待你如贵客，殷切热情，把你视为知己。他们让你同享舒适与荣华，让你住到他们的家里，如此慷慨、如此随意，而你却用欺骗、镇压和侮辱来回报他们。</p>

<p>3．动与静</p>
<p>在人类的生命长河里，尽管有神圣的阳光，却也有一股凛冽的寒风。彩虹女神为它染上了色彩，冷霜冻结了它的安眠。我们要当心，不要让一时的修葺变成石头般的安眠——它们天长地久地经受着暴风雨的肆虐和雷电的侵袭，却仍然不失其尊严；然而当风暴平息、流水再不起波澜，它们却让青草覆盖，在耕犁之下化作尘土。</p>
<p>4．时间和变化</p>
<p>时间是一个几乎通了灵性的词，而变化完全是人的主观想法；在自然界，我们与其说变化，不如说发展。太阳看起来是沉入大海的黑暗之中，但它却从另一个半球升起。一座被毁的城市倒塌成废墟，但这些断壁残垣却常常用来建造出更恢宏的建筑；即便它们的确完全被摧毁，只留下一地尘土，大自然却仍然悉心呵护着建造在它们上面的王国。在人们的辛勤劳作之下，那植物的世界蓬勃发展，永远焕发着生机，提供着粮食、活力与美景——它就在那城市的遗迹之上，那废墟原是因荣耀而起，如今却用于实际。</p>
<p>5．诗人</p>
<p>我们不能说诗人描绘了并不存在的生活。他只是把生活原本的微妙本质加以提炼和浓缩，捕捉并凝结了那飘散的芬芳，集聚了星点的美丽，延长了精妙而又转瞬即逝的欢乐；诗人也的确精于此道。因为他愿意体验人生，并不全然被生计的担忧、物质的满足所吞没，而又容许通过无限开阔的方式，让更高等的生灵享有了情趣与愉悦。</p>
<p>6．群山</p>
<p>山自有一种魅力，这魅力如此强大，以至于只是寥寥数语的提及，或者只是对其巍峨风貌的粗略勾画，都能激发人们的想象，让想象的翅膀翱翔在那令人陶醉的群山深处。人们的心中充满了它们广阔无边的孤独！灵魂的目光凝聚在它们那寂静、崇高而连绵不绝的山峰之上！它们寂寞的呐喊，它们喷涌的山泉叮咚，它们的大瀑布轰隆作响，全都汇成了音乐，紧紧联结着我们的心房！高原的草地、岩石间长出的鲜花、庄严的老松散发出的清香让人精神焕发！那环绕四方的光影，那澄亮的雾气，弥漫在幽谷和矮坡之上，如同挥洒在一幅无与伦比的巨幅画作中，如此壮美堂皇！</p>

<p>THE JOLLY OLD PEDAGOGUE</p>
<p>快活的老先生</p>
<p>George Arnold, 1834—1865, was born in New York City. He never
attended school, but was educated at home, by his parents. His literary
career occupied a period of about twelve years. In this time he wrote
stories, essays, criticisms in art and literature, poems, sketches,
etc., for several periodicals. Two volumes of his poems have been
published since his death.</p>
<p>’T was a jolly old pedagogue, long ago,</p>
<p>Tall, and slender, and sallow, and dry;</p>
<p>His form was bent, and his gait was slow,</p>
<p>And his long, thin hair was white as snow,</p>
<p>But a wonderful twinkle shone in his eye:</p>
<p>And he sang every night as he went to bed,</p>
<p>“Let us be happy down here below;</p>
<p>The living should live, though the dead be dead,”</p>
<p>Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.</p>
<p>He taught the scholars the Rule of Three,</p>
<p>Reading, and writing, and history too;</p>
<p>He took the little ones on his knee,</p>
<p>For a kind old heart in his breast had he,</p>
<p>And the wants of the littlest child he knew.</p>
<p>“Learn while you’re young,” he often said,</p>
<p>“There is much to enjoy down here below;</p>
<p>Life for the living, and rest for the dead!”</p>
<p>Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.</p>
<p>With the stupidest boys, he was kind and cool,</p>
<p>Speaking only in gentlest tones;</p>
<p>The rod was scarcely known in his school—</p>
<p>Whipping to him was a barbarous rule,</p>
<p>And too hard work for his poor old bones;</p>
<p>Besides it was painful, he sometimes said:</p>
<p>“We should make life pleasant down here below—</p>
<p>The living need charity more than the dead,”</p>
<p>Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.</p>
<p>He lived in the house by the hawthorn lane,</p>
<p>With roses and woodbine over the door;</p>
<p>His rooms were quiet, and neat, and plain,</p>
<p>But a spirit of comfort there held reign,</p>
<p>And made him forget he was old and poor.</p>
<p>“I need so little,” he often said;</p>
<p>“And my friends and relatives here below</p>
<p>Won’t litigate over me when I am dead,”</p>
<p>Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.</p>
<p>But the pleasantest times he had of all,</p>
<p>Were the sociable hours he used to pass,</p>
<p>With his chair tipped back to a neighbor’s wall,</p>
<p>Making an unceremonious call,</p>
<p>Over a pipe and a friendly glass:</p>
<p>This was the finest pleasure, he said,</p>
<p>Of the many he tasted here below:</p>
<p>“Who has no cronies had better be dead,”</p>
<p>Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.</p>
<p>The jolly old pedagogue’s wrinkled face</p>
<p>Melted all over in sunshiny smiles;</p>
<p>He stirred his glass with an old-school grace,</p>
<p>Chuckled, and sipped, and prattled apace,</p>
<p>Till the house grew merry from cellar to tiles.</p>
<p>“I’m a pretty old man,” he gently said,</p>
<p>“I’ve lingered a long time here below;</p>
<p>But my heart is fresh, if my youth is fled!”</p>
<p>Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.</p>
<p>He smoked his pipe in the balmy air</p>
<p>Every night, when the sun went down;</p>
<p>And the soft wind played in his silvery hair,</p>
<p>Leaving its tenderest kisses there,</p>
<p>On the jolly old pedagogue’s jolly old crown;</p>
<p>And feeling the kisses, he smiled, and said:</p>
<p>“’T is it glorious world down here below;</p>
<p>Why wait for happiness till we are dead?”</p>
<p>Said this jolly old pedagogue, long ago.</p>
<p>He sat at his door one midsummer night,</p>
<p>After the sun had sunk in the west,</p>
<p>And the lingering beams of golden light</p>
<p>Made his kindly old face look warm and bright,</p>
<p>While the odorous night winds whispered, “Rest!”</p>
<p>Gently, gently, he bowed his head;</p>
<p>There were angels waiting for him, I know;</p>

<h2 id="lesson-26-4">LESSON 26</h2>
<p>THE TEACHER AND SICK SCHOLAR</p>
<p>老师和病倒的学生</p>
<p>Shortly after the schoolmaster had arranged the forms and taken his
seat behind his desk, a small white-headed boy with a sunburnt face
appeared at the door, and, stopping there to make a rustic bow, came in
and took his seat upon one of the forms. He then put an open book,
astonishingly dog’s-eared, upon his knees, and, thrusting his hands into
his pockets, began counting the marbles with which they were filled;
displaying, in the expression of his face, a remarkable capacity of
totally abstracting his mind from the spelling on which his eyes were
fixed.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, another white-headed little boy came straggling in,
and after him, a red-headed lad, and then one with a flaxen poll, until
the forms were occupied by a dozen boys, or thereabouts, with heads of
every color but gray, and ranging in their ages from four years old to
fourteen years or more; for the legs of the youngest were a long way
from the floor, when he sat upon the form; and the eldest was a heavy,
good-tempered fellow, about half a head taller than the
schoolmaster.</p>
<p>At the top of the first form—the post of honor in the school—was the
vacant place of the little sick scholar; and, at the head of the row of
pegs, on which those who wore hats or caps were wont to hang them, one
was empty. No boy attempted to violate the sanctity of seat or peg, but
many a one looked from the empty spaces to the schoolmaster, and
whispered to his idle neighbor, behind his hand.</p>
<p>Then began the hum of conning over lessons and getting them by heart,
the whispered jest and stealthy game, and all the noise and drawl of
school; and in the midst of the din, sat the poor schoolmaster, vainly
attempting to fix his mind upon the duties of the day, and to forget his
little sick friend. But the tedium of his office reminded him more
strongly of the willing scholar, and his thoughts were rambling from his
pupils—it was plain.</p>
<p>None knew this better than the idlest boys, who, growing bolder with
impunity, waxed louder and more daring; playing “odd or even” under the
master’s eye; eating apples openly and without rebuke; pinching each
other in sport or malice, without the least reserve; and cutting their
initials in the very legs of his desk. The puzzled dunce, who stood
beside it to say his lesson “off the book,” looked no longer at the
ceiling for forgotten words, but drew closer to the master’s elbow, and
boldly cast his eye upon the page; the wag of the little troop squinted
and made grimaces (at the smallest boy, of course), holding no book
before his face, and his approving companions knew no constraint in
their delight. If the master did chance to rouse himself, and seem alive
to what was going on, the noise subsided for a moment, and no eye met
his but wore a studious and deeply humble look; but the instant he
relapsed again, it broke out afresh, and ten times louder than
before.</p>
<p>Oh! how some of those idle fellows longed to be outside, and how they
looked at the open door and window, as if they half meditated rushing
violently out, plunging into the woods, and being wild boys and savages
from that time forth. What rebellious thoughts of the cool river, and
some shady bathing place, beneath willow trees with branches dipping in
the water, kept tempting and urging that sturdy boy, who, with his shirt
collar unbuttoned, and flung back as far as it could go, sat fanning his
flushed face with a spelling book, wishing himself a whale, or a minnow,
or a fly, or anything but a boy at school, on that hot, broiling
day.</p>
<p>Heat! ask that other boy, whose seat being nearest to the door, gave
him opportunities of gliding out into the garden, and driving his
companions to madness, by dipping his face into the bucket of the well,
and then rolling on the grass,—ask him if there was ever such a day as
that, when even the bees were diving deep down into the cups of the
flowers, and stopping there, as if they had made up their minds to
retire from business, and be manufacturers of honey no more. The day was
made for laziness, and lying on one’s back in green places, and staring
at the sky, till its brightness forced the gazer to shut his eyes and go
to sleep. And was this a time to be poring over musty books in a dark
room, slighted by the very sun itself? Monstrous!</p>
<p>The lessons over, writing time began. This was a more quiet time; for
the master would come and look over the writer’s shoulder, and mildly
tell him to observe how such a letter was turned up, in such a copy on
the wall, which had been written by their sick companion, and bid him
take it as a model. Then he would stop and tell them what the sick child
had said last night, and how he had longed to be among them once again;
and such was the poor schoolmaster’s gentle and affectionate manner,
that the boys seemed quite remorseful that they had worried him so much,
and were absolutely quiet; eating no apples, cutting no names, and
making no grimaces for full two minutes afterward.</p>
<p>“I think, boys,” said the schoolmaster, when the clock struck twelve,
“that I shall give you an extra half holiday this afternoon.” At this
intelligence, the boys, led on and headed by the tall boy, raised a
great shout, in the midst of which the master was seen to speak, but
could not be heard. As he held up his hand, however, in token of his
wish that they should be silent, they were considerate enough to leave
off, as soon as the longest-winded among them were quite out of breath.
“You must promise me, first,” said the schoolmaster, “that you’ll not be
noisy, or at least, if you are, that you’ll go away first, out of the
village, I mean. I’m sure you would n’t disturb your old playmate and
companion.”</p>
<p>There was a general murmur (and perhaps a very sincere one, for they
were but boys) in the negative; and the tall boy, perhaps as sincerely
as any of them, called those about him to witness, that he had only
shouted in a whisper. “Then pray don’t forget, there’s my dear
scholars,” said the schoolmaster, “what I have asked you, and do it as a
favor to me. Be as happy as you can, and do n’t be unmindful that you
are blessed with health. Good-by, all.”</p>
<p>“Thank ’ee, sir,” and “Good-by, sir,” were said a great many times in
a great variety of voices, and the boys went out very slowly and softly.
But there was the sun shining and there were birds singing, as the sun
only shines and the birds only sing on holidays and half holidays; there
were the trees waving to all free boys to climb, and nestle among their
leafy branches; the hay, entreating them to come and scatter it to the
pure air; the green corn, gently beckoning toward wood and stream; the
smooth ground, rendered smoother still by blending lights and shadows,
inviting to runs and leaps, and long walks, nobody knows whither. It was
more than boy could bear, and with a joyous whoop, the whole cluster
took to their heels, and spread themselves about, shouting and laughing
as they went. “’T is natural, thank Heaven!” said the poor schoolmaster,
looking after them, “I am very glad they did n’t mind me.”</p>
<p>Toward night, the schoolmaster walked over to the cottage where his
little friend lay sick. Knocking gently at the cottage door, it was
opened without loss of time. He entered a room where a group of women
were gathered about one who was wringing her hands and crying bitterly.
“O dame!” said the schoolmaster, drawing near her chair, “is it so bad
as this?” Without replying, she pointed to another room, which the
schoolmaster immediately entered; and there lay his little friend,
half-dressed, stretched upon a bed.</p>
<p>He was a very young boy; quite a little child. His hair still hung in
curls about his face, and his eyes were very bright; but their light was
of heaven, not of earth. The schoolmaster took a seat beside him, and,
stooping over the pillow whispered his name. The boy sprung up, stroked
his face with his hand, and threw his wasted arms around his neck,
crying, that he was his dear, kind friend. “I hope I always was. I meant
to be, God knows,” said the poor schoolmaster. “You remember my garden,
Henry?” whispered the old man, anxious to rouse him, for dullness seemed
gathering upon the child, “and how pleasant it used to be in the evening
time? You must make haste to visit it again, for I think the very
flowers have missed you, and are less gay than they used to be. You will
come soon, very soon now, won’t you?”</p>
<p>The boy smiled faintly—so very, very faintly—and put his hand upon
his friend’s gray head. He moved his lips too, but no voice came from
them,— no, not a sound. In the silence that ensued, the hum of distant
voices, borne upon the evening air, came floating through the open
window. “What’s that?” said the sick child, opening his eyes. “The boys
at play, upon the green.” He took a handkerchief from his pillow, and
tried to wave it above his head. But the feeble arm dropped powerless
down. “Shall I do it?” said the schoolmaster. “Please wave it at the
window,” was the faint reply. “Tie it to the lattice. Some of them may
see it there. Perhaps they’ll think of me, and look this way.”</p>
<p>He raised his head and glanced from the fluttering signal to his idle
bat, that lay, with slate, and book, and other boyish property, upon the
table in the room. And then he laid him softly down once more, and again
clasped his little arms around the old man’s neck. The two old friends
and companions—for such they were, though they were man and child—held
each other in a long embrace, and then the little scholar turned his
face to the wall and fell asleep.</p>
<hr />
<p>The poor schoolmaster sat in the same place, holding the small, cold
hand in his, and chafing it. It was but the hand of a dead child. He
felt that; and yet he chafed it still, and could not lay it down.</p>

<h4 id="中文阅读-473">中文阅读</h4>
<p>老师摆放好学生们坐的长木凳，刚刚在讲台后面坐下来，一个淡黄色头发、脸晒得黝黑的小男孩就出现在门口。他站在那儿粗鲁地鞠了个躬，就走进来坐到其中一个长木凳上。然后他摊开一本边角折得厉害的书，放在膝头，把两手插到口袋里，开始数里面装得满满的弹子；眼睛盯着书上的拼写，脸上的表情却显示他的心思早飞到爪哇国去了。</p>
<p>不一会儿，另一个淡黄色头发的小男孩也晃晃悠悠地走了进来，跟在他身后的是个红头发的小子，然后是个亚麻色头发的。十来个男孩陆续入了座，脑袋上的头发什么颜色都有，除了灰白以外。他们的年纪大概从四岁到十四岁不等；最小的男孩坐在木凳上，双腿还差一大截才能够到地板，而最大的男孩是个脾气温和的大个子，比老师还高出了大约半个头。</p>
<p>第一排最好的位置是学校里头的荣誉座位——如今空着，是为那个生病的小学生留下来的。那一排挂帽钩的头一个也是空的。没有哪个男孩想要把那座位或挂帽钩据为己有，冒犯它们的神圣，但好多人都望望那空空如也的座位和挂钩，又望望老师，用手掩着嘴与无所事事的同伴窃窃私语着。</p>
<p>随后就是一片嗡嗡的读书声，但真正让他们聚精会神的是细声细语的笑话、偷偷摸摸的游戏、还有故意拖长声调的阅读以及学校里头一切的嘈杂。在这一片喧嚣之中坐着可怜的老师，他徒劳地想要精神集中在他的职责上面，忘记他那生病的小朋友。然而他的教室里一片沉闷，让他禁不住更为强烈地想念那个听话的学生，他的心思早已不在眼前这些孩子的身上——这再清楚不过了。</p>
<p>没有谁能像这些懒惰的孩子们了解老师的心思，知道自己不会受罚以后，他们就更加大胆起来。他们的嗓门越来越大，就在老师的眼皮底下玩起猜谜游戏；又公然地啃着苹果，却没有听到一句责备；你掐我一下我掐你一下，有时是开玩笑有时是恶狠狠的，一副肆无忌惮的样子；还把姓名的首字母刻在讲台的四个腿上。讲台旁边站着的那个笨学生正在背诵他的课文，如今也不再盯着天花板搜索那些忘掉的词，却凑到老师的手肘旁，大胆地盯着老师手里的书看。那些“小童子军”中最爱恶作剧的一个挤眉弄眼，做着鬼脸（当然是朝其中年纪最小的男孩），课本也不放在面前，而他的伙伴们开怀大笑，一点儿也不压抑他们的欢乐。要是老师碰巧回过神来，似乎注意到了眼前发生的一切，喧闹声就会平息一阵，大家都回避着他的眼神，只流露出一副用功而谦虚的表情。然而只要他一恢复原状，喧闹声就会重新爆发，比原来还要响十倍。</p>
<p>啊！不少懒家伙们是多么渴望到外头去啊！他们盯着敞开的门窗，似乎半副心思都在盘算着猛然冲出去，一头扎到树林里头，随心所欲地撒野，从此成了个野蛮人。那清凉的河水，在枝条垂到水里的柳树阴蔽下最适合洗澡了——那样酷热的天气里，这些念头引诱着、催促着那个结实的男孩，他的衣领大敞着，尽量向后翻，坐在那儿用拼写本扇着涨红的脸，但愿自己变成一条鲸鱼、一条小鱼或者一只苍蝇，只要不是一个在学校里头上学的男孩就好。</p>
<p>热啊！问问那个坐在门边的男孩，他瞅好时机溜到花园里去，把脸浸到放在水井里头的木桶里，接着就在草地上打滚，把他的伙伴们都气疯了——问问他可曾有过这么热的天，甚至连蜜蜂也潜到花蕊里头，一动不动，仿佛它们下定决心撒手不干，从此也不再酿造蜂蜜了。这天气最适合什么也不做，就躺在绿油油的草地上，凝视着天空，直到白花花的日头迫使人闭上眼睛睡了过去。难道这时候该闷在连阳光也忽略了的黑暗小屋里，钻研那些发霉的书本吗？真是太不像话了！</p>
<p>授课结束，写字时间开始了。这段时间教室里更加安静了，老师走来走去，站在执笔者身边端详着，温和地告诉他去看看这个字母该怎么写，要他对照着墙上贴的、他们那生病的伙伴所写的作业，吩咐他把那当作范本。随后他停下脚步，告诉他们昨晚那个生病的孩子说了什么，他如何渴望能再度回到大家中间。可怜的老师那温柔而慈爱的样子，让男孩们不禁感到内疚，后悔自己让老师如此操心。他们完全安静下来，不啃苹果了，不刻名字了，也不做鬼脸了，足足维持了有两分钟之久。</p>
<p>“孩子们，我想，”时钟敲了12下，老师说道：“下午我要给你们额外放半天假。”男孩们听到这条消息，就由高个子男孩带头大喊大叫起来，期间老师似乎说了些什么，但没有人听得见。不过，当他举手示意大家安静的时候，孩子们就很体贴地闭上了嘴——就在那些嚷得最久的孩子终于喘不上气的时候。“你们必须先答应我，”老师说，“不要吵闹，至少要闹起来的时候，你们就先到别处去，我的意思是到村子外头去。我相信你们都不想打扰你们的好伙伴吧。”</p>
<p>教室里响起一片不满的窃窃私语声（也许他们的不满是十分诚恳的，因为他们只不过是小男孩而已）。那个高个子男孩也许和别人一样诚恳，叫那些旁边的孩子替他作证，他只是小声地喊了一下。“我亲爱的同学们，请你们不要忘了，”老师说，“我对你们的请求，就算是帮帮我的忙吧。尽情地玩儿去吧，但可不要忘了感恩，你们都拥有一个健康的身体。再见吧，同学们。”</p>
<p>“谢啦，老师”，“再见喽，老师”，这两句话被各种高低粗细的嗓音说了许多遍，男孩们就轻手轻脚地慢慢走出了教室。然而阳光照耀，鸟儿歌唱，仿佛只有在假日——这额外的假日中，才有这样明媚的阳光、鸟儿才会卖弄这样婉转的歌喉；树木们向着所有自由自在的男孩们招手，要他们爬上去，依偎在绿叶繁茂的枝头；一堆干草请求他们过去，把它挥洒在明净的空气中；绿油油的稻田，温柔地把他们引向树林和小溪；平坦的大地上光影交错，显得更加迷人，引诱着他们奔跑、跳跃和漫步，尽管没有人知道要往哪儿去。男孩们再也把持不住了，随着一声欢乐的叫喊，这一群人撒腿就跑，向四面八方散开，边跑边叫着、笑着。“这就是自然的本能，谢谢上帝！”可怜的老师看着他们的背影说，“我很高兴他们并没有在意我的话。”</p>
<p>夜幕快降临的时候，老师走到了一户农舍前，他的小朋友正躺在里面的病榻上。他轻轻地敲响了农舍的门，门立即就开了。他走进一个房间，只见一群妇女把其中一个围在中间，那女人双手紧握，痛苦地哀号着。“啊，夫人！”老师靠近她，说道，“情况糟到如此地步吗？”她没有回答，伸手指了指另一个房间，老师马上走了进去。房间里有他的小朋友，半披着衣服，有气无力地躺在床上。</p>
<p>他看起来年纪很小，还是个小孩儿。一绺绺卷曲的头发垂在脸上，双眼非常明亮，但那是来自天国的光芒，并不属于这人间。老师在他旁边坐下，弯下腰去，贴着枕头轻声呼唤他的名字。男孩一下子坐了起来，用手摸着老师的脸，又伸出细细的胳膊抱着他的脖子，嚷嚷着说他是自己亲爱的、仁慈的朋友。“我希望一直都是如此。上帝知道我的真心。”可怜的老师说。“你记得我的花园吗，亨利？”老人轻轻地说道，他急切地想要把孩子唤醒，因为似乎有一种死气沉沉的气氛萦绕在孩子周围：“你记得夜晚的时候它是多么迷人吗？你要赶紧再去看看它，里面的花儿都在想念你呢，它们看起来也没有往日的欢乐了。你很快就会来的，很快，是么？”</p>
<p>男孩微微地笑了，那笑容微弱得难以察觉，他把手放在他朋友那花白的头发上。他又动了动嘴唇，但没有发出声音——他一点儿话也说不出来了。接着是一片沉寂，远远的、喧嚷的人声随着夜风飘进敞开的窗户里。“那是什么声音？”生病的孩子睁开了双眼。“男孩子们在草地上玩儿呢。”孩子从枕头底下拿出一条手绢，想要举到头上挥舞一下。但他软弱的胳膊无力地垂了下来。“让我来好吗？”老师说。“请你在窗口挥一下它。”男孩用微弱的声音回答，“把它系在窗棂上。他们有人可能会看见的。也许他们会想起我，向这边看一看。”</p>
<p>他抬起头，望向那飘扬的信号，又看看他闲置已久的球棒——它就放在桌子上，旁边摆着写字用的石板、书本和其他男孩的小玩意儿。接着他又轻轻地躺下了，再一次把两条细小的胳膊环绕在老人的脖子上。两个老朋友、老伙伴——尽管一个是大人，一个是孩子——久久地拥抱在一起，随后那小男孩就把脸转过去，对着墙壁睡着了。</p>
<p>可怜的老师仍然坐在原处，把他那只冷冰冰的小手握在自己的手中摩挲着。这不过是一只死去的孩子的手。他感觉到了。但他仍然摩挲着这只手，不肯把它放下。</p>

<p>THE SNOW SHOWER</p>
<p>下雪</p>
<p>William Cullen Bryant, 1794-1878, was the son of Peter Bryant, a
physician of Cummington, Massachusetts. Amid the beautiful scenery of
this remote country town, the poet was born; and here he passed his
early youth. At the age of sixteen, Bryant entered Williams College, but
was honorably dismissed at the end of two years. He then entered on the
study of law, and was admitted to the bar at the age of twenty-one. He
practiced his profession, with much success, for about nine years. In
1826, he removed to New York, and became connected with the “Evening
Post,” a connection which continued to the time of his death. For more
than thirty of the last years of his life, Mr. Bryant made his home near
Roslyn, Long Island, where he occupied an “old-time mansion,” which he
bought, fitted up, and surrounded in accordance with his excellent rural
taste. A poem of his, written at the age of ten years, was published in
the “County Gazette,” and two poems of considerable length were
published in book form, when the author was only fourteen.
“Thanatopsis,” perhaps the best known of all his poems, was written when
he was but nineteen. But, notwithstanding his precocity, his powers
continued to a remarkable age. His, excellent translations of the
“Iliad” and the “Odyssey,” together with some of his best poems, were
accomplished after the poet, had passed the age of seventy. Mr. Bryant
visited Europe several times; and, in 1849, he continued his travels
into Egypt and Syria. Abroad, he was received with many marks of
distinction; and he added much to his extensive knowledge by studying
the literature of the countries he visited.</p>
<p>All his poems exhibit a peculiar love, and a careful study, of
nature; and his language, both in prose and poetry, is always chaste,
elegant, and correct. His mind was well-balanced; and his personal
character was one to be admired, loved, and imitated.</p>
<p>Stand here by my side and turn, I pray,</p>
<p>On the lake below thy gentle eyes;</p>
<p>The clouds hang over it, heavy and gray,</p>
<p>And dark and silent the water lies;</p>
<p>And out of that frozen mist the snow</p>
<p>In wavering flakes begins to flow;</p>
<p>Flake after flake</p>
<p>They sink in the dark and silent lake.</p>
<p>See how in a living swarm they come</p>
<p>From the chambers beyond that misty veil;</p>
<p>Some hover in air awhile, and some</p>
<p>Rush prone from the sky like summer hail.</p>
<p>All, dropping swiftly, or settling slow,</p>
<p>Meet, and are still in the depths below;</p>
<p>Flake after flake</p>
<p>Dissolved in the dark and silent lake.</p>
<p>Here delicate snow stars, out of the cloud,</p>
<p>Come floating downward in airy play,</p>
<p>Like spangles dropped from the glistening crowd</p>
<p>That whiten by night the Milky Way;</p>
<p>There broader and burlier masses fall;</p>
<p>The sullen water buries them all,—</p>
<p>Flake after flake,—</p>
<p>All drowned in the dark and silent lake.</p>
<p>And some, as on tender wings they glide</p>
<p>From their chilly birth cloud, dim and gray.</p>
<p>Are joined in their fall, and, side by side,</p>
<p>Come clinging along their unsteady way;</p>
<p>As friend with friend, or husband with wife,</p>
<p>Makes hand in hand the passage of life;</p>
<p>Each mated flake</p>
<p>Soon sinks in the dark and silent lake.</p>
<p>Lo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste</p>
<p>Stream down the snows, till the air is white,</p>
<p>As, myriads by myriads madly chased,</p>
<p>They fling themselves from their shadowy height.</p>
<p>The fair, frail creatures of middle sky,</p>
<p>What speed they make, with their grave so nigh;</p>
<p>Flake after flake</p>
<p>To lie in the dark and silent lake.</p>
<p>I see in thy gentle eyes a tear;</p>
<p>They turn to me in sorrowful thought;</p>
<p>Thou thinkest of friends, the good and dear,</p>
<p>Who were for a time, and now are not;</p>
<p>Like these fair children of cloud and frost,</p>
<p>That glisten a moment an then are lost,</p>
<p>Flake after flake,—</p>
<p>All lost in the dark and silent lake.</p>
<p>Yet look again, for the clouds divide;</p>
<p>A gleam of blue on the water lies;</p>
<p>And far away, on the mountain side,</p>
<p>A sunbeam falls from the opening skies.</p>
<p>But the hurrying host that flew between</p>
<p>The cloud and the water no more is seen;</p>
<p>Flake after flake</p>
<p>At rest in the dark and silent lake.</p>

<p>一片接着一片，</p>
<p>全迷失在无光无声的湖中。</p>
<p>转眼再望去，云朵已分开，</p>
<p>一束微微的蓝光映在水面；</p>
<p>远远的，在群山边上，</p>
<p>从天空的豁口射下一束阳光。</p>
<p>飞舞在云水之间</p>
<p>急匆匆的主人已不见。</p>
<p>一片接着一片，</p>
<p>在无光无声的湖中安眠。</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE</p>
<p>拿破仑·波拿巴之品性</p>
<p>Charles Phillips, 1787-1859, an eminent barrister and orator, was
born in Sligo, Ireland, and died in London. He gained much of his
reputation as an advocate in criminal cases. In his youth he published
some verses; later in life he became the author of several works,
chiefly of biography.</p>
<p>He is fallen! We may now pause before that splendid prodigy, which
towered among us like some ancient ruin, whose power terrified the
glance its magnificence attracted. Grand, gloomy, and peculiar, he sat
upon the throne a sceptered hermit, wrapt in the solitude of his own
originality. A mind, bold, independent, and decisive; a will, despotic
in its dictates; an energy that distanced expedition; and a conscience,
pliable to every touch of interest, marked the outlines of this
extraordinary character—the most extraordinary, perhaps, that in the
annals of this world ever rose, or reigned, or fell.</p>
<p>Flung into life in the midst of a revolution that quickened every
energy of a people who acknowledged no superior, he commenced his
course, a stranger by birth, and a scholar by charity. With no friend
but his sword, and no fortune but his talents, he rushed into the lists
where rank, and wealth, and genius had arrayed themselves, and
competition fled from him, as from the glance of destiny.</p>
<p>He knew no motive but interest; acknowledged no criterion but
success; he worshiped no God but ambition; and, with an eastern
devotion, he knelt at the shrine of his idolatry. Subsidiary to this,
there was no creed that he did not profess, there was no opinion that he
did not promulgate: in the hope of a dynasty, he upheld the crescent;
for the sake of a divorce, he bowed before the cross; the orphan of
St. Louis, he became the adopted child of the Republic; and, with a
parricidal ingratitude, on the ruins both of the throne and the tribune,
he reared the throne of his despotism. A professed Catholic, he
imprisoned the Pope; a pretended patriot, he impoverished the country;
and in the name of Brutus, he grasped without remorse, and wore without
shame, the diadem of the Caesars.</p>
<p>The whole continent trembled at beholding the audacity of his
designs, and the miracle of their execution. Skepticism bowed to the
prodigies of his performance; romance assumed the air of history; nor
was there aught too incredible for belief, or too fanciful for
expectation, when the world saw a subaltern of Corsica waving his
imperial flag over her most ancient capitals. All the visions of
antiquity became commonplace in his contemplation: kings were his
people; nations were his outposts; and he disposed of courts, and
crowns, and camps, and churches, and cabinets, as if they were the
titular dignitaries of the chessboard! Amid all these changes, he stood
immutable as adamant. It mattered little whether in the field, or in the
drawing-room; with the mob, or the levee; wearing the Jacobin bonnet, or
the iron crown; banishing a Braganza, or espousing a Hapsburg; dictating
peace on a raft to the Czar of Russia, or contemplating defeat at the
gallows of Leipsic he was still the same military despot.</p>
<p>In this wonderful combination, his affectations of literature must
not be omitted. The jailer of the press, he affected the patronage of
letters; the proscriber of books, he encouraged philosophy; the
persecutor of authors, and the murderer of printers, he yet pretended to
the protection of learning; the assassin of Palm, the silencer of De
Stael, and the denouncer of Kotzebue, he was the friend of David, the
benefactor of De Lille, and sent his academic prize to the philosopher
of England.</p>
<p>Such a medley of contradictions, and, at the same time, such an
individual consistency, were never united in the same character. A
royalist, a republican, and an emperor; a Mohammedan, a Catholic, and a
patron of the synagogue; a subaltern and a sovereign; a traitor and a
tyrant; a Christian and an infidel; he was, through all his
vicissitudes, the same stern, impatient, inflexible original; the same
mysterious, incomprehensible self; the man without a model, and without
a shadow.</p>

<p>他倒下了！我们现在可以在这位举世无双的奇才面前驻足。他像远古的遗迹一般伫立在我们中间，被他的威严吸引而来的目光，又在他的威力面前不寒而栗。高贵、阴沉、独特的他，如被授予王杖的隐士，独自坐在王座之上，他的独一无二凸显着他的孤独。他的心灵，勇敢、独立而果断；他的意志，唯我独尊，随心所欲；他的精力，让远征军也自愧不如；他的良知，屈从于每一种切身利益之下；这些特征大致构成了这样一位非凡的人物——在这个兴亡迭起的世界，他的非凡也许千古未见。</p>
<p>这场革命让否认一切权威的人们调集起了越来越惊人的力量，他就这样投入了正进行得如火如荼的革命当中，开始他的大业。他是一个天赋异禀的人，一个悲天悯人的博爱者。只有利剑充当他的朋友，只把才华当作他的财富，他匆匆进入了按等级、财产及才能高低排列的名单，所向披靡，命运亦无法把他左右。</p>
<p>他唯一的出发点是利益，唯一的标准是成功，唯一膜拜的是野心；凭借着一种东方式的虔诚，他跪倒在崇拜自我的神殿里。此外，没有一种信条他不能承认，也没有一种观点他无法宣扬；为了对一个皇朝的觊觎，他支持伊斯兰教徒；出于离婚的目的，他在十字架面前鞠躬；圣·路易
(1)
的遗孤，成了共和国的继子；他不知感恩、嗜杀恩主，踏着王座与神坛的废墟，竖立起唯我独尊的宝座。这个宣了誓的天主教徒，把罗马教皇关进监狱；这个口口声声的爱国者，让国家积贫积弱；以布鲁特斯
(2) 的名义，他攫取王权而不带一点懊悔，身着王袍而没有任何羞愧。</p>
<p>目睹他企图谋划的厚颜无耻，野心实践的不可思议，整个大陆为之颤抖。怀疑论折服于他的精湛演技；浪漫主义披上了历史的外衣；当全世界见证来自科西嘉小岛的中尉把他称帝的旗帜插在最古老的首都之上，没有任何事情难以置信，没有任何期望不切实际。所有古时的想象，在他的规划下成了寻常不过的事：国王成了他的臣民；各国成了他的前哨；在他手里的法庭、王权、军营、教堂和内阁，不过是棋盘上有名无实的将领，任由摆布！在风云变幻之间，他自岿然不动。无论是在战场上，还是在休息室里，无论是在暴民之中，还是在早朝之上，无论是戴着铁盔还是头顶雅各宾派的圆帽
(3) ，无论是驱逐一个布拉干萨 (4) 的显贵，还是支持一个哈布斯堡 (5)
的王族，无论在前往俄国沙皇的木筏上要求和平，还是在莱比锡 (6)
的绞刑架上沉思败局，他始终都是一位好战的暴君。</p>
<p>在这奇妙的混合之中，他对文学的热爱亦不能让人忽略。作为看守新闻界的狱卒，他喜欢定夺文字；作为禁书者，他提倡哲学；作为迫害作家和谋杀出版商的人，他还假惺惺地要保护知识。他暗杀帕姆
(7) ，逼迫斯塔尔 (8) 沉默，谴责科茨布 (9) ；他是大卫 (10) 的朋友，里尔
(11) 的赞助人，又把他的学术奖颁给了英格兰的哲人。</p>
<p>一个矛盾的混合体，同时又保持着个人的一致性，这样的结合是前所未见。一个保皇主义者、一个共和主义者和一个皇帝；一个伊斯兰教徒、天主教徒和犹太教的保护人；一个中尉和一个君王；一个叛国者和一个暴君；一个基督徒和一个异教徒——在所有这些浮沉变幻之中，他一直是那个严厉、急躁而顽固的个体，一个神秘莫测的自我，一个无法效仿的人，一个没有影子的人。</p>

<p>NAPOLEON AT REST</p>
<p>长眠的拿破仑</p>
<p>John Pierpont, 1785-1866, was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, and
graduated from Yale College in 1804. The next four years he spent as a
private tutor in the family of Col. William Allston, of South Carolina.
On his return, he studied law in the law school of his native town. He
entered upon practice, but soon left the law for mercantile pursuits, in
which he was unsuccessful. Having studied theology at Cambridge, in 1819
he was ordained pastor of the Hollis Street Unitarian Church, in Boston,
where he continued nearly twenty years. He afterwards preached four
years for a church in Troy, New York, and then removed to Medford,
Massachusetts. At the age of seventy-six, he became chaplain of a
Massachusetts regiment; but, on account of infirmity, war soon obliged
to give up the position. Mr. Pierpont published a series of school
readers, which enjoyed a well-deserved popularity for many years.</p>
<p>His poetry is smooth, musical, and vigorous. Most of his pieces were
written for special occasions.</p>
<p>His falchion flashed along the Nile;</p>
<p>His hosts he led through Alpine snows;</p>
<p>O’er Moscow’s towers, that blazed the while,</p>
<p>His eagle flag unrolled,—and froze.</p>
<p>Here sleeps he now, alone! Not one</p>
<p>Of all the kings, whose crowns he gave,</p>
<p>Bends o’er his dust;—nor wife nor son</p>
<p>Has ever seen or sought his grave.</p>
<p>Behind this seagirt rock! the star,</p>
<p>That led him on from crown to crown,</p>
<p>Has sunk; and nations from afar</p>
<p>Gazed as it faded and went down.</p>
<p>High is his couch;—the ocean flood,</p>
<p>Far, far below, by storms is curled;</p>
<p>As round him heaved, while high he stood,</p>
<p>A stormy and unstable world.</p>
<p>Alone he sleeps! The mountain cloud,</p>
<p>That night hangs round him, and the breath</p>
<p>Of morning scatters, is the shroud</p>
<p>That wraps the conqueror’s clay in death.</p>
<p>Pause here! The far-off world, at last,</p>
<p>Breathes free; the hand that shook its thrones,</p>
<p>And to the earth its miters cast,</p>
<p>Lies powerless now beneath these stones.</p>
<p>Hark! comes there from the pyramids,</p>
<p>And from Siberian wastes of snow,</p>
<p>And Europe’s hills, a voice that bids</p>
<p>The world he awed to mourn him? No:</p>
<p>The only, the perpetual dirge</p>
<p>That’s heard there is the sea bird’s cry,—</p>
<p>The mournful murmur of the surge,—</p>
<p>The cloud’s deep voice, the wind’s low sigh.</p>

<p>他率领大军穿越阿尔卑斯山的积雪，</p>

<p>如今他长眠于此，孤身一人！</p>
<p>由他赐予王冠的君主，没有一个</p>
<p>面对他的尘灰俯首——亦没有妻儿</p>
<p>前来探访，站在他的墓前。</p>
<p>在这四面环海的孤石 (1) 后面！那星星，</p>

<p>默默凝视着它的黯淡和沉没。</p>
<p>他的卧榻高高——海浪翻滚，</p>

<p>他高高站立，把他托起的，</p>
<p>是一个风雨飘摇的世界。</p>
<p>他孤独入睡！夜里萦绕他的</p>
<p>山间白云，清晨吹散的</p>
<p>阵阵微风，就是那寿衣</p>
<p>包裹着征服者死去的肉体。</p>

<p>WAR</p>
<p>战争</p>
<p>Charles Sumner. 1811-1874, was born in Boston. He studied at the
Latin school in his native city, graduated from Harvard University at
the age of nineteen, studied law at the same institution, and was
admitted to practice in 1834. He at once took a prominent position in
his profession, lectured to the law classes at Cambridge for several
successive years, wrote and edited several standard law books, and might
have had a professorship in the law school, had he desired it. In his
famous address on “The True Grandeur of Nations,” delivered July 4,
1815, before the municipal authorities of Boston, he took strong grounds
against war among nations. In 1851 he was elected to the United States
Senate and continued in that position till his death. As a jurist, as a
statesman, as an orator, and as a profound and scholarly writer,
Mr. Sumner stands high in the estimation of his countrymen. In physical
appearance, Mr. Sumner was grand and imposing; men often turned to gaze
after him, as he passed along the streets of his native city.</p>
<p>I need not dwell now on the waste and cruelty of war. These stare us
wildly in the face, like lurid meteor lights, as we travel the page of
history. We see the desolation and death that pursue its demoniac
footsteps. We look upon sacked towns, upon ravaged territories, upon
violated homes; we behold all the sweet charities of life changed to
wormwood and gall. Our soul is penetrated by the sharp moan of mothers,
sisters, and daughters—of fathers, brothers, and sons, who, in the
bitterness of their bereavement, refuse to be comforted. Our eyes rest
at last upon one of these fair fields, where Nature, in her abundance,
spreads her cloth of gold, spacious and apt for the entertainment of
mighty multitudes—or perhaps, from the curious subtlety of its position,
like the carpet in the Arabian tale, seeming to contract so as to be
covered by a few only, or to dilate so as to receive an innumerable
host. Here, under a bright sun, such as shone at Austerlitz or Buena
Vista—amidst the peaceful harmonies of nature—on the Sabbath of peace—we
behold bands of brothers, children of a common Father, heirs to a common
happiness, struggling together in the deadly fight, with the madness of
fallen spirits, seeking with murderous weapons the lives of brothers who
have never injured them or their kindred. The havoc rages. The ground is
soaked with their commingling blood. The air is rent by their
commingling cries. Horse and rider are stretched together on the earth.
More revolting than the mangled victims, than the gashed limbs, than the
lifeless trunks, than the spattering brains, are the lawless passions
which sweep, tempest-like, through the fiendish tumult.</p>
<p>Horror-struck, we ask, wherefore this hateful contest? The
melancholy, but truthful answer comes, that this is the established
method of determining justice between nations!</p>
<p>The scene changes. Far away on the distant pathway of the ocean two
ships approach each other, with white canvas broadly spread to receive
the flying gales. They are proudly built. All of human art has been
lavished in their graceful proportions, and in their well compacted
sides, while they look in their dimensions like floating happy islands
on the sea. A numerous crew, with costly appliances of comfort, hives in
their secure shelter. Surely these two travelers shall meet in joy and
friendship; the flag at the masthead shall give the signal of
friendship; the happy sailors shall cluster in the rigging, and even on
the yardarms, to look each other in the face, while the exhilarating
voices of both crews shall mingle in accents of gladness uncontrollable.
It is not so. Not as brothers, not as friends, not as wayfarers of the
common ocean, do they come together; but as enemies.</p>
<p>The gentle vessels now bristle fiercely with death-dealing
instruments. On their spacious decks, aloft on all their masts, flashes
the deadly musketry. From their sides spout cataracts of flame, amidst
the pealing thunders of a fatal artillery. They, who had escaped “the
dreadful touch of merchant-marring rocks” —who had sped on their long
and solitary way unharmed by wind or wave—whom the hurricane had
spared—in whose favor storms and seas had intermitted their immitigable
war—now at last fall by the hand of each other. The same spectacle of
horror greets us from both ships. On their decks, reddened with blood,
the murderers of St. Bartholomew and of the Sicilian Vespers, with the
fires of Smithfield, seem to break forth anew, and to concentrate their
rage. Each has now become a swimming Golgotha. At length, these
vessels—such pageants of the sea—once so stately—so proudly built—but
now rudely shattered by cannon balls—with shivered mast’s and ragged
sails—exist only as unmanageable wrecks, weltering on the uncertain
waves, whose temporary lull of peace is now their only safety. In
amazement at this strange, unnatural contest—away from country and
home—where there is no country or home to defend—we ask again, wherefore
this dismal duel? Again the melancholy but truthful answer promptly
comes, that this is the established method of determining justice
between nations.</p>

<p>此刻，战争的损耗与残酷已无需我赘述了。当我们在历史的书页中遨游时，这些景象就如同炫目的流星划过一般，肆无忌惮地呈现在我们眼前。紧跟着战争那恶魔般的脚步，我们看见一片废墟与尸骸。我们凝望着洗劫一空的城镇，凝望着铁蹄蹂躏的疆土，凝望着被任意践踏的家园；我们眼睁睁地看着生命中所有温馨的慈爱转变为痛苦与耻辱。我们的灵魂，被母亲、姐妹和女儿们尖利的哀号所刺穿——她们由于丧失了父亲、兄弟和儿子陷入苦痛之中，任何的慰藉也无济于事。我们的目光最终停留在这其中一片美丽的土地上，丰饶的大自然在这里铺展她无边无际的金黄画布，恰好为神气活现的芸芸众生带来欢愉——也许，这片土地以它微妙的身份充当了阿拉伯神话中的魔毯，似乎可以缩小到只能允许几个人站在上面，或者延伸到可以接待难以计数的宾客。在这儿，在同样照耀着奥斯德立兹和布温纳·维斯特的明亮的阳光之下——在自然宁谧的和谐之中——在平静的安息日，我们看见一群群的弟兄、同一位神父的子民、同一份幸福的后裔，在殊死的搏斗之中难分难解，他们坠落的灵魂已然疯狂，他们手持致命的杀人武器，搜寻着以前从未伤害过他们或他们族人的兄弟，要取对方的性命。这场空前浩劫仍在蔓延。他们共同的鲜血浸透了土地。他们共同的叫喊撕裂了空气。战马和马上的人一起倒在这土地上。血肉模糊的死者，切断的残肢，僵硬的躯干，飞溅的脑浆——比这些更令人厌恶的，是在这无比残酷的动乱之中那如暴风雨般横扫一切的、无法无天的激情。</p>
<p>种种惊骇之状惨不忍睹，我们不禁要问，这场令人深恶痛绝的争斗是为了什么？令人悲哀而又千真万确的答案摆在眼前：这是国家之间裁决正义的一贯方式！</p>
<p>场景变化了。遥远的大洋航线上，两艘船慢慢靠近，大大的白色风帆飘展着，向飞扬的海风致意。两艘船都造得气势恢宏。比例恰到好处的桥身和坚固结实的船体，把人类艺术的精妙全都展现得淋漓尽致；而船只的规模如此之大，看起来就像海上漂浮的快乐小岛。众多的船员，配备了昂贵的设施用具，居住在他们安全的寓所里。无疑，这两个远航者应该在欢喜和友好之中相会，桅顶的旗帜是展示友好的标志，快活的水手聚集在索具旁，甚至爬到桅杆顶端，去瞧一瞧对方的样子，双方船员们兴高采烈的欢呼声混合在一起，汇成一片无法抑制的喜悦。事实并非如此。这两艘船相遇了，他们不像兄弟，不像朋友，不像这共有的大洋上航行的过客——而是作为双方之敌。</p>
<p>这两艘温文尔雅的船如今怒发冲冠，用置人于死地的武器发起猛烈攻击。宽敞的甲板上，高高的桅杆上，都有致命的火枪在吐着火舌。摧毁一切的大炮发出震耳欲聋的响声，船的两侧涌出了激流般的火焰。他们曾与“商旅的克星礁石”相遇，从那“可怕的接触”中逃脱；他们曾抵御了风暴和海浪的侵袭，渡过了漫长而孤独的旅途；他们被飓风赦免；而善意的风暴和海浪亦曾打断他们难分难解的对战——如今，他们却终于死于彼此之手。</p>
<p>两艘船迎接我们的是同样令人惊骇的景象。甲板被鲜血染红，圣巴托罗缪和西西里人晚祷大屠杀的凶手，带着史密斯菲尔德的枪火，仿佛重现人间，把他们的盛怒积聚在一起倾泻。每一艘船都变成了水中漂浮的受难所。这些海上的华丽游行队伍，曾经如此富丽堂皇，曾经造得如此气势恢宏，如今却被炮弹粗暴地炸得粉碎，只剩折断的桅杆，破烂的风帆，这无法收拾的残骸在无常的海浪上翻滚着，此刻短暂的平静成了它们唯一的安稳。这古怪而不近人情的争斗让人感到惊奇——在这远离了祖国和家园的地方，没有祖国亦没有家园需要守卫的地方——我们不禁再次发问，这凄惨的对决是为了什么？令人悲哀而又千真万确的答案，再次突兀地摆在眼前：这是国家之间裁决正义的一贯方式。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-31-4">LESSON 31</h2>
<p>SPEECH OF WALPOLE IN REPROOF OF MR. PITT</p>
<p>沃波尔责斥皮特先生的演讲</p>
<p>Sir Robert Walpole, 1676-1745, was educated at Eton and Cambridge. He
entered Parliament in 1700, and soon became a good debater and skillful
tactician. He was prime minister of Great Britain from 1721 to 1742, in
the reigns of George I. and George II. He was an able statesman; but has
been accused of employing corruption or bribery on a large scale, to
control Parliament and accomplish his purposes.</p>
<p>I was unwilling to interrupt the course of this debate, while it was
carried on with calmness and decency, by men who do not suffer the ardor
of opposition to cloud their reason, or transport them to such
expressions as the dignity of this assembly does not admit.</p>
<p>I have hitherto deferred answering the gentleman, who declaimed
against the bill with such fluency and rhetoric, and such vehemence of
gesture; who charged the advocates for the expedients now proposed, with
having no regard to any interests but their own, and with making laws
only to consume paper, and threatened them with the defection of their
adherents, and the loss of their influence, upon this new discovery of
their folly and ignorance. Nor, do I now answer him for any other
purpose than to remind him how little the clamor of rage and petulancy
of invective contribute to the end for which this assembly is called
together; how little the discovery of truth is promoted, and the
security of the nation established, by pompous diction and theatrical
emotion.</p>
<p>Formidable sounds and furious declamation, confident assertions and
lofty periods, may affect the young and inexperienced; and perhaps the
gentleman may have contracted his habits of oratory by conversing more
with those of his own age than with such as have more opportunities of
acquiring knowledge, and more successful methods of communicating their
sentiments. If the heat of temper would permit him to attend to those
whose age and long acquaintance with business give them an indisputable
right to deference and superiority, he would learn in time to reason,
rather than declaim; and to prefer justness of argument and an accurate
knowledge of facts, to sounding epithets and splendid superlatives,
which may disturb the imagination for a moment, but leave no lasting
impression upon the mind. He would learn, that to accuse and prove are
very different; and that reproaches, unsupported by evidence, affect
only the character of him that utters them.</p>
<p>Excursions of fancy and flights of oratory are indeed pardonable in
young men, but in no other; and it would surely contribute more, even to
the purpose for which some gentlemen appear to speak (that of
depreciating the conduct of the administration), to prove the
inconveniences and injustice of this bill, than barely to assert them,
with whatever magnificence of language, or appearance of zeal, honesty,
or compassion.</p>

<p>这场辩论双方表现得冷静沉着、文雅有礼，并未被针锋相对的激情冲昏了头脑，亦未采取这场庄严的聚会所不容许的表达方式；于是我原本并不愿打扰这场辩论的进程。</p>
<p>到目前为止，我仍未回答这位绅士的问题。他用流畅华丽的语言慷慨陈词反对法案，用激烈的姿态指责这项临时法案的拥护者，控诉他们满脑子只考虑自己的利益，制定的法律一无是处、浪费纸张，并威胁说大众一旦发现他们的愚蠢无知，所有追随者将会纷纷背叛，他们的影响力也将丧失殆尽。我现在对他所作出的回答也别无它意，只有一个目的：我要提醒他，对于把我们召集于此的这场聚会而言，愤怒的叫嚣、急躁的谩骂对结果没有任何助益；傲慢的措辞、夸张的情感对发扬真理和保卫国家亦没有什么意义。</p>
<p>可怕的喧嚣与激昂的雄辩，自信的断言与傲慢的辞藻，也许会触动年轻而涉世未深的人；也许这位绅士应和同等年龄的人多作交谈，而不是与有更多机会获取知识、有更成功的方式表达情感的人们对话，来养成他尽情发挥演说才能的习惯。要是易于激动的脾气允许他留心听取那些德高望重的人的意见——年龄阅历和对事务的丰富经验，赋予了那些人毫无争议的权利，让他们卓越不群，并赢得了大众尊重——那么他就能及时学会理性思考而非慷慨陈词；他就会更注重论证的公平和事实的精确，而非夸大其词的修饰和冠冕堂皇的措辞——这些修饰和措辞也许会暂时搅乱了人们的想象，却不会在心灵之中留下持久的痕迹。他就会懂得，指控和证实截然不同；毫无根据的指责，只是影响了口出恶言之人的品格。</p>
<p>想象的远足和卖弄辞藻的飞行，这在年轻人身上的确是可以宽恕的；但其他人则不在宽恕之列。发言者应证明这项法案的不便及不公平之处，而非仅仅妄下断言，这样做无疑更有助益——即使是对那些发言目的就是贬低政府运作的先生们而言也是如此——无论他言辞是如何冠冕堂皇，无论他看起来是如何热诚、正直而心怀悲悯。</p>

<p>PITT’S REPLY TO SIR ROBERT WALPOLE</p>
<p>皮特对罗伯特·沃波尔爵士的回应</p>
<p>William Pitt, 1708—1778, one of the ablest statesmen and orators of
his time, was born in Cornwall, and educated at Eton and Oxford. He
entered Parliament in 1735, and became a formidable opponent of the
ministry of Sir Robert Walpole. He gained great reputation by his wise
and vigorous management of military affairs in the last years of the
reign of George II. He opposed the “Stamp Act” with great earnestness,
as well as the course of the ministry in the early years of the American
Revolution. In 1778, he rose from a sick bed to make his celebrated
speech, in the House of Lords, in opposition to a motion to acknowledge
the independence of America. At its close, he fell in an apoplectic fit,
and was borne home to die in a few weeks afterward. He was buried in
Westminster Abbey. Mr. Pitt possessed a fine personal presence and a
powerful voice; he was very popular with the people, and is often called
the “Great Commoner.” He was created “Earl of Chatham” in 1766.</p>
<p>The atrocious crime of being a young man, which the honorable
gentleman has, with such spirit and decency, charged upon me, I shall
neither attempt to palliate nor deny; but content myself with hoping
that I may be one of those whose follies cease with their youth, and not
of that number who are ignorant in spite of experience. Whether youth
can be imputed to a man as a reproach, I will not assume the province of
determining; but surely age may become justly contemptible, if the
opportunities which it brings have passed away without improvement, and
vice appears to prevail when the passions have subsided. The wretch,
who, after having seen the consequences of a thousand errors, continues
still to blunder, and whose age has only added obstinacy to stupidity,
is surely the object either of abhorrence or contempt, and deserves not
that his gray hairs should secure him from insult. Much more is he to be
abhorred, who, as he has advanced in age, has receded from virtue, and
become more wicked—with less temptation; who prostitutes himself for
money which he can not enjoy, and spends the remains of his life in the
ruin of his country.</p>
<p>But youth is not my only crime; I am accused of acting a theatrical
part. A theatrical part may either imply some peculiarity of gesture, or
a dissimulation of my real sentiments, and an adoption of the opinions
and language of another man. In the first sense, the charge is too
trifling to be confuted, and deserves only to be mentioned that it may
be despised. I am at liberty, like every other man, to use my own
language; and though, perhaps, I may have some ambition to please this
gentleman, I shall not lay myself under any restraint, nor very
solicitously copy his diction or his mien, however matured by age, or
modeled by experience.</p>
<p>But, if any man shall, by charging me with theatrical behavior, imply
that I utter any sentiments but my own, I shall treat him as a
calumniator and a villain; nor shall any protection shelter him from the
treatment he deserves. I shall, on such an occasion, without scruple,
trample upon all those forms with which wealth and dignity intrench
themselves, nor shall anything but age restrain my resentment;
age,—which always brings one privilege, that of being insolent and
supercilious, without punishment!</p>
<p>But, with regard to those whom I have offended, I am of opinion that,
if I had acted a borrowed part, I should have avoided their censure: the
heat that offended them was the ardor of conviction, and that zeal for
the service of my country which neither hope nor fear shall influence me
to suppress. I will not sit unconcerned while my liberty is invaded, nor
look in silence upon public robbery. I will exert my endeavors, at
whatever hazard, to repel the aggressor, and drag the thief to justice,
whoever may protect him in his villainies, and whoever may partake of
his plunder.</p>

<p>这位受人尊敬的先生义正词严、彬彬有礼地指责我，认为正值青春年华是一种残暴的罪恶。我对此并不想要辩解，也不打算否认；但我甘愿成为那随着青春的流逝终将不再荒唐的年轻人，而非加入那阅历丰富却愚昧无知的一群。青春是否能成为一个人的罪过，这样的问题我不会擅自裁决；然而可以肯定的是，倘若激情消退而恶习渐多，任由随着岁月而来的机会白白溜走却没有任何长进，那么年龄增长很有可能成为一个人的可鄙之处。一个人目睹了上千个过失而引起的恶果，却仍然继续犯错，年龄的增长带给他的唯有固执和愚蠢；那么这个家伙无疑就是我们厌恶和轻蔑的对象，那灰白的头发也不能赋予他免受侮辱的权利。他身上还有更多令人憎恶的东西：随着年岁渐长，他的美德渐失，更经不起诱惑，愈加道德沦丧；他为获取自己根本无福享用的金钱而做尽坏事，他的余生无非是在把他的国家引向毁灭。</p>
<p>而年轻还不是我唯一的罪过，我又被指控为表现夸张。表现夸张可能是指我某些特别的姿势，或者是说我隐藏了我真实的感情，还借鉴了其他人的意见和言语。无疑，他所指责的内容微不足道，不值一驳，只能叫人鄙视而已。我和其他任何人一样，有自由去使用我自己的语言进行表达；我不会让自己受到任何约束，也不会渴望去模仿他的措辞和风度，无论他被岁月洗礼得多么成熟，又被经验磨炼成怎样的典范。</p>
<p>然而，如果任何人指控我行事夸张，是在暗示我随意宣泄自己的情感，那我就会把他看成是个恶意诽谤我的恶棍，这样的人罪有应得，不能把他轻易饶恕。遇到了这种场合，对那些躲在万贯家财和尊贵身份壁垒中的人，我要毫不犹豫践踏上去，即使年龄也不该约束我的愤怒——年龄，它总是赋予人一种傲慢无礼、目空一切的特权，这样的人却无需受到任何惩罚！</p>
<p>不过，对于被我冒犯了的那些人来说，我的想法是：倘若我扮演了个虚伪的角色，那我就该回避他们的非难；冒犯他们的激动乃是信念所带来的激情，无论是希冀亦或恐惧，都无法压制我为祖国服务的一腔热忱。我的自由受到侵犯，我不能坐在一旁无动于衷；我亦不能眼睁睁地看着光天化日之下的抢劫。无论冒着怎样的危险，我都要鼓起勇气去反抗那个侵略者，尽力把那个罪犯绳之于法，不管是谁保护他的恶行，亦不管谁分享了他的赃物。</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF MR. PITT</p>
<p>皮特先生的品格</p>
<p>Henry Grattan, 1750-1820, an Irish orator and statesman, was born at
Dublin, and graduated from Trinity College, in his native city. By his
admiration of Mr. Pitt, the first Earl of Chatham, he was led to turn
his attention to oratory. In personal appearance, he was
unprepossessing; but his private character was without a blemish.</p>
<p>The secretary stood alone. Modern degeneracy had not reached him.
Original and unaccommodating, the features of his character had the
hardihood of antiquity. His august mind overawed majesty itself. No
state chicanery, no narrow system of vicious politics, no idle contest
for ministerial victories, sank him to the vulgar level of the great;
but overbearing, persuasive, and impracticable, his object was England,
his ambition was fame.</p>
<p>Without dividing, he destroyed party; without corrupting, he made a
venal age unanimous. France sunk beneath him. With one hand he smote the
house of Bourbon, and wielded in the other the democracy of England. The
sight of his mind was infinite; and his schemes were to effect, not
England, not the present age only, but Europe and posterity. Wonderful
were the means by which those schemes were accomplished; always
seasonable, always adequate, the suggestion of an understanding animated
by ardor and enlightened by prophecy.</p>
<p>The ordinary feelings which make life amiable and indolent, were
unknown to him. No domestic difficulties, no domestic weakness, reached
him; but, aloof from the sordid occurrences of life, and unsullied by
its intercourse, he came occasionally into our system, to counsel and
decide. A character so exalted, so strenuous, so various, so
authoritative, astonished a corrupt age, and the treasury trembled at
the name of Pitt, through all classes of venality. Corruption imagined,
indeed, that she had found defects in this statesman, and talked much of
the inconsistency of his glory, and much of the ruin of his victories;
but the history of his country, and the calamities of the enemy,
answered and refuted her.</p>
<p>Nor were his political his only talents. His eloquence was an era in
the senate; peculiar and spontaneous; familiarly expressing gigantic
sentiments and instructive wisdom; not like the torrent of Demosthenes,
or the splendid conflagration of Tully; it resembled sometimes the
thunder, and sometimes the music of the spheres. He did not conduct the
understanding through the painful subtilty of argumentation, nor was he
ever on the rack of exertion; but rather lightened upon the subject, and
reached the point by the flashings of the mind, which, like those of the
eye, were felt, but could not be followed.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, there was in this man something that could create,
subvert, or reform; an understanding, a spirit, and an eloquence, to
summon mankind to society, or to break the bonds of slavery asunder, and
to rule the wildness of free minds with unbounded authority; something
that could establish or overwhelm empires, and strike a blow in the
world that should resound through the universe.</p>

<p>这位大臣独自伫立。他身上并未沾染近代的堕落风气。他棱角分明、不懂圆滑，个性有着古人刚毅的风范。他那威严的思想震撼了帝皇。他说话从不强词夺理，从不为恶政设立狭隘的制度，也不会把时间浪费在内阁的明争暗斗中；因而他从未堕落至平庸之中。他横扫一切困难，有令人信服的说辞和不屈不挠的意志，他的服务对象是整个英格兰，他的抱负就是赢得声望。</p>
<p>无需离间，他消灭了党派之争；无需贿赂，他取得了一个贪污盛行的时代的一致支持。法兰西在他面前低头。他一手摧毁了保守派的皇朝，一手运转着英格兰的民主。他高瞻远瞩，他的宏图大计不只是对英格兰、对当今社会产生影响，而是惠及了整个欧洲及子孙后代。完成那些大计的方法卓越非凡，总是掐准时机、恰到好处，显现了他那由热忱所激活、由洞察力所启示的智慧。</p>
<p>让人生变得轻快、懒散的那些平常感受，对于他而言是完全陌生的。没有什么个人的困难或弱点会把他吓倒；相反，他始终远离生活中的肮脏可鄙，在淤杂人事中仍然保持自己的清白，他就这样偶尔闯进我们的圈子，提出忠告并作出抉择。这样的个性如此高贵、如此积极、如此富于变化、如此充满权威，让这个堕落的时代惊诧莫名，财政部上上下下贪赃枉法之人，都在皮特的大名前战栗。贪污者的确妄想能在这位政治家身上找到弱点，喋喋不休地议论他的荣耀不会持久、他的胜利终将化为乌有；然而祖国的历史进程，其对手的势穷力竭，无不是对贪污者有力的回应和驳斥。</p>
<p>他的才华不仅体现在政治上。他的口才让议会风气为之一新。他的演说风格独树一帜、信手拈来，熟悉的表达中蕴含着丰厚的情感和启发人心的智慧，既不像古希腊演说家狄摩西尼斯的滔滔不绝，亦不像罗马演说家塔利的慷慨激昂；他的演说有时仿佛一声惊雷，有时又如同一曲天籁。他不是通过细微而费劲的辩论去赢得听众的理解，亦不是使劲浑身解数去发挥口才，而是闪电般直入主题，在思维的闪光之下切中要害——他的思想就如同他的双眼一般闪烁着光芒，我们可以感知，却不能效法。</p>
<p>总而言之，这个男人身上蕴含着创造、颠覆和改革的力量。他的精神、判断力及雄辩之才，能够召唤人类去交流，打破奴隶制的枷锁，用无上的权威慑服那些自由心灵的狂野。他身上所蕴含的力量能建立或推翻一个王国，在世间刮起一股响彻宇宙的雄风。</p>

<p>THE SOLDIER’S REST</p>
<p>战士的休息</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott, 1771-1832, the great Scotch poet and novelist, was
born in Edinburgh. Being a feeble child, he was sent to reside on his
grandfather’s estate in the south of Scotland. Here he spent several
years, and gained much knowledge of the traditions of border warfare, as
well as of the tales and ballads pertaining to it. He was also a great
reader of romances in his youth. In 1779 be returned to Edinburgh, and
became a pupil in the high school. Four years later, he entered the
university; but in neither school nor college, was he distinguished for
scholarship. In 1797 he was admitted to the practice of law,—a
profession which he soon forsook for literature. His first poems
appeared in 1802. The “Lay of the Last Minstrel” was published in 1805,
“Marmion” in 1808, and “The Lady of the Lake” in 1810. Several poems of
less power followed. In 1814 “Waverley,” his first novel, made its
appearance, but the author was unknown for some time. Numerous other
novels followed with great rapidity, the author reaping a rich harvest
both in fame and money. In 1811 he purchased an estate near the Tweed,
to which he gave the name of Abbotsford. In enlarging his estate and
building a costly house, he spent vast sums of money. This, together
with the failure of his publishers in 1826, involved him very heavily in
debt. But he set to work with almost superhuman effort to pay his debts
by the labors of his pen. In about four years, he had paid more than
$300,000; but the effort was too much for his strength, and hastened his
death.</p>
<p>In person, Scott was tall, and apparently robust, except a slight
lameness with which he was affected from childhood. He was kindly in
disposition, hospitable in manner, fond of outdoor pursuits and of
animals, especially dogs. He wrote with astonishing rapidity, and always
in the early morning. At his death, he left two sons and two daughters.
A magnificent monument to his memory has been erected in the city of his
birth. The following selection is from “The Lady of the Lake.”</p>

<p>HENRY V. TO HIS TROOPS</p>
<p>亨利五世致部队士兵</p>
<p>William Shakespeare. 1564-1616, was born at Stratford-upon-Avon. By
many (perhaps most) critics, Shakespeare is regarded as the greatest
poet the world has ever produced; one calls him, “The most illustrious
of the sons of men.” And yet it is a curious fact that less is really
known of his life and personal characteristics than is known of almost
any other famous name in history. Over one hundred years ago, a writer
said, “All that is known with any degree of certainty concerning
Shakespeare is—that he was born at Stratford-upon-Avon—married and had
children there—went to London, where he commenced acting, and wrote
poems and plays—returned to Stratford, made his will, died, and was
buried.” All the research of the last one hundred years has added but
very little to this meager record. He was married, very young, to Anne
Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior; was joint proprietor of
Blackfriar’s Theater in 1589, and seems to have accumulated property,
and retired three or four years before his death. He was buried in
Stratford Church, where a monument has been erected to his memory; he
also has a monument, in “Poet’s Corner” of Westminster Abbey. His family
soon became extinct. From all we can learn, he seems to have been highly
respected and esteemed by his contemporaries.</p>
<p>His works consist chiefly of plays and sonnets. His writings show an
astonishing knowledge of human nature, expressed in language wonderful
for its point and beauty. His style is chaste and pure, judged by the
standard of his times, although expressions may sometimes be found that
would not be considered proper in a modern writer. It has been argued by
some that Shakespeare did not write the works imputed to him; but this
theory seems to have little to support it. This extract is from King
Henry V., Act III, Scene I.</p>
<p>Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;</p>
<p>Or close the wall up with our English dead.</p>
<p>In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man</p>
<p>As modest stillness and humility:</p>
<p>But when the blast of war blows in our ears,</p>
<p>Then imitate the action of the tiger;</p>
<p>Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,</p>
<p>Disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage;</p>

<p>SPEECH OF PAUL ON MARS HILL</p>
<p>保罗在玛斯山上的演说</p>
<p>Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill, and said, Ye men of
Athens! I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. For as I
passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this
inscription, To THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship,
him declare I unto you. God that made the world and all things therein
(seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth) dwelleth not in temples
made with hands; neither is worshiped with men’s hands, as though he
needed anything, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all
things; and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on
all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek the
Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not
far from everyone of us: for in him we live, and move, and have our
being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his
offspring. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not
to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven
by art and man’s device. And the times of this ignorance God winked at;
but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent: because he hath
appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness
by that Man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto
all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. And when they heard
of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will
hear thee again of this matter. So Paul departed from among them.
Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed; among the which was
Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with
them.</p>

<p>罗站在亚略巴古当中，说：众位雅典人哪，我看你们凡事很敬畏鬼神。我游行的时候，观看你们所敬拜的，遇见一座坛，上面写着未识之神。你们所不认识而敬拜的，我现在告诉你们。创造宇宙和其中万物的神，既是天地的主，就不住人手所造的殿，也不用人手供养，好像神缺少什么；自己倒将生命、气息、万物，赐给万人。他用血脉造出万族的人，住在整个大地上，并且预先定准他们的年限和所住的疆界，要叫他们寻求神，或者可以揣摩而得，其实他离我们各人不远；我们生活、动作、存留，都在乎他。就如你们作诗的，有人说：我们也是他所生的。我们既是神所生的，就不当以为神的神性像人用手艺、心思所雕刻的金、银、石。世人蒙昧无知的时候，神并不监察，如今却吩咐各处的人都要悔改。因为他已经定了日子，要借着他所设立的人按公义审判天下，并且叫他从死里复活，给万人作可信的凭据。众人听见从死里复活的话，就有讥诮他的；又有人说：我们再听你讲这个吧！于是保罗从他们当中出去了。但有几个人贴近他，信了主，其中有亚略巴古的官丢尼修，和一个妇人，名叫大马哩，还有别人一同信从。</p>

<p>LAFAYETTE AND ROBERT RAIKES</p>
<p>拉斐德和罗伯特·莱格斯</p>
<p>Thomas S. Grimke’, 1786-1834, an eminent lawyer and scholar, was born
in Charleston, South Carolina, graduated at Yale in 1807, and died of
cholera near Columbus, Ohio. He descended from a Huguenot family that
was exiled from France by the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He
gained considerable reputation as a politician, but is best known as an
advocate of peace, Sunday Schools, and the Bible. He was a man of deep
feeling, earnest purpose, and pure life. Some of his views were very
radical and very peculiar. He proposed sweeping reforms in English
orthography, and disapproved of the classics and of pure mathematics in
any scheme of general education. The following is an extract from an
address delivered at a Sunday-school celebration.</p>
<p>It is but a few years since we beheld the most singular and memorable
pageant in the annals of time. It was a pageant more sublime and
affecting than the progress of Elizabeth through England after the
defeat of the Armada; than the return of Francis I. from a Spanish
prison to his own beautiful France; than the daring and rapid march of
the conqueror at Austerlitz from Frejus to Paris. It was a pageant,
indeed, rivaled only in the elements of the grand and the pathetic, by
the journey of our own Washington through the different states. Need I
say that I allude to the visit of Lafayette to America?</p>
<p>But Lafayette returned to the land of the dead, rather than of the
living. How many who had fought with him in the war of ’76, had died in
arms, and lay buried in the grave of the soldier or the sailor! How many
who had survived the perils of battle, on the land and the ocean, had
expired on the deathbed of peace, in the arms of mother, sister,
daughter, wife! Those. who survived to celebrate with him the jubilee of
1825, were stricken in years, and hoary-headed; many of them infirm in
health; many the victims of poverty, or misfortune, or affliction. And,
how venerable that patriotic company; how sublime their gathering
through all the land; how joyful their welcome, how affecting their
farewell to that beloved stranger!</p>
<p>But the pageant has fled, and the very materials that gave it such
depths of interest are rapidly perishing: and a humble, perhaps a
nameless grave, shall hold the last soldier of the Revolution. And shall
they ever meet again? Shall the patriots and soldiers of ’76, the
“Immortal Band,” as history styles them, meet again in the amaranthine
bowers of spotless purity, of perfect bliss, of eternal glory? Shall
theirs be the Christian’s heaven, the kingdom of the Redeemer? The
heathen points to his fabulous Elysium as the paradise of the soldier
and the sage. But the Christian bows down with tears and sighs, for he
knows that not many of the patriots, and statesmen, and warriors of
Christian lands are the disciples of Jesus.</p>
<p>But we turn from Lafayette, the favorite of the old and the new
world, to the peaceful benevolence, the unambitious achievements of
Robert Raikes. Let us imagine him to have been still alive, and to have
visited our land, to celebrate this day with us. No national ships would
have been offered to bear him, a nation’s guest, in the pride of the
star-spangled banner, from the bright shores of the rising, to the
brighter shores of the setting sun. No cannon would have hailed him in
the stern language of the battlefield, the fortunate champion of
Freedom, in Europe and America. No martial music would have welcomed him
in notes of rapture, as they rolled along the Atlantic, and echoed
through the valley of the Mississippi. No military procession would have
heralded his way through crowded streets, thickset with the banner and
the plume, the glittering saber and the polished bayonet. No cities
would have called forth beauty and fashion, wealth and rank, to honor
him in the ballroom and theater. No states would have escorted him from
boundary to boundary, nor have sent their chief magistrate to do him
homage. No national liberality would have allotted to him a nobleman’s
domain and princely treasure. No national gratitude would have hailed
him in the capitol itself, the nation’s guest, because the nation’s
benefactor; and have consecrated a battle ship, in memory of his wounds
and his gallantry.</p>
<p>Not such would have been the reception of Robert Raikes, in the land
of the Pilgrims and of Penn, of the Catholic, the Cavalier, and the
Huguenot. And who does not rejoice that it would be impossible thus to
welcome this primitive Christian, the founder of Sunday schools? His
heralds would be the preachers of the Gospel, and the eminent in piety,
benevolence, and zeal. His procession would number in its ranks the
messengers of the Cross and the disciples of the Savior, Sunday-school
teachers and white-robed scholars. The temples of the Most High would be
the scenes of his triumph. Homage and gratitude to him, would be anthems
of praise and thanksgiving to God.</p>
<p>Parents would honor him as more than a brother; children would
reverence him as more than a father. The faltering words of age, the
firm and sober voice of manhood, the silvery notes of youth, would bless
him as a Christian patron. The wise and the good would acknowledge him
everywhere as a national benefactor, as a patriot even to a land of
strangers. He would have come a messenger of peace to a land of peace.
No images of camps, and sieges, and battles; no agonies of the dying and
the wounded; no shouts of victory, or processions of triumph, would
mingle with the recollections of the multitude who welcomed him. They
would mourn over no common dangers, trials, and calamities; for the road
of duty has been to them the path of pleasantness, the way of peace.
Their memory of the past would be rich in gratitude to God, and love to
man; their enjoyment of the present would be a prelude to heavenly
bliss; their prospects of the future, bright and glorious as faith and
hope.</p>
<p>Such was the reception of Lafayette, the warrior; such would be that
of Robert Raikes, the Howard of the Christian church. And which is the
nobler benefactor, patriot, and philanthropist? Mankind may admire and
extol Lafayette more than the founder of the Sunday schools; but
religion, philanthropy, and enlightened common sense must ever esteem
Robert Raikes the superior of Lafayette. His are the virtues, the
services, the sacrifices of a more enduring and exalted order of being.
His counsels and triumphs belong less to time than to eternity.</p>
<p>The fame of Lafayette is of this world; the glory of Robert Raikes is
of the Redeemer’s everlasting kingdom. Lafayette lived chiefly for his
own age, and chiefly for his and our country; but Robert Raikes has
lived for all ages and all countries. Perhaps the historian and
biographer may never interweave his name in the tapestry of national or
individual renown. But the records of every single church honor him as a
patron; the records of the universal Church, on earth as in heaven,
bless him as a benefactor.</p>
<p>The time may come when the name of Lafayette will be forgotten; or
when the star of his fame, no longer glittering in the zenith, shall be
seen, pale and glimmering, on the verge of the horizon. But the name of
Robert Raikes shall never be forgotten; and the lambent flame of his
glory is that eternal fire which rushed down from heaven to devour the
sacrifice of Elijah. Let mortals then admire and imitate Lafayette more
than Robert Raikes. But the just made perfect, and the ministering
spirits around the throne of God, have welcomed him as a fellow-servant
of the same Lord; as a fellow-laborer in the same glorious cause of
man’s redemption; as a coheir of the same precious promises and eternal
rewards.</p>

<p>在漫漫时间长河里，我们目睹的那一场独一无二、最令人难忘的盛典，仅仅是几年之前发生的事情。这一次游行盛典，比打败西班牙无敌舰队后伊丽莎白女皇进行的全英大巡行，比弗朗西斯一世从西班牙的监狱回到他美丽的故乡法兰西，比奥斯德利兹的征服者拿破仑风驰电掣、意气风发地从弗雷瑞斯进军巴黎，都要显得更为盛大而激动人心。这确实是一次盛典，唯一能与之匹敌的就是我们华盛顿的长途跋涉——他率军穿越了一个个州，那景象宏大壮观却亦招人心伤。无需赘言，你们应该明白，我指的是拉斐德到访美国的事情吧？</p>
<p>然而拉斐德回到的这片土地，与其说属于鲜活的生命，不如说是一片幽魂的领土。那些1776年与他并肩作战的伙伴，有多少已死在了战火之中，埋在了士兵或水手的坟墓里！有多少侥幸生还的人，逃过了陆上或海里的枪林弹雨，却在和平的岁月里寿终正寝，倒在了母亲、姐姐、女儿或妻子的怀抱里！那些与他共同欢庆1825年周年纪念的幸存者，全都饱经风霜、头发花白；其中有许多年迈多病，又有许多倒在了贫困、不幸或苦难之中。那一群爱国者是多么值得尊敬！他们从各地汇聚到一起的场面如此庄严，他们的欢迎之声如此欣喜，他们向那亲爱的异乡人告别的场景如此感人肺腑！</p>
<p>然而盛典已逝，那些能让它影响深远的要素已经迅速衰亡。也许独立革命的最后一位士兵，是躺在一座不起眼的坟中，也许上面连名字也没有。那些1776年的爱国者和军人们，历史称呼他们为“不朽的一群人”，他们是否会在那圣洁无瑕、极度欢乐、永恒荣耀的不死之地再度相逢？他们是否将置身于基督徒的天堂、救世主的王国之中？异教徒指着那传奇中的极乐世界，声称那便是军人和圣哲的天堂。然而基督徒却俯下身来，叹息着流泪，因为他清楚，基督土地上的爱国者、政客和战士们，没有多少是耶稣的信徒。</p>
<p>然而，让我们暂且抛开新旧世界共同的宠儿——拉斐德，把目光转向罗伯特·莱格斯在和平时期所作出的慈善事业，看看他那朴实无华的成就吧。没有哪个慷慨的国家会分封他贵族的领地，赐给他堪比王侯的财富。没有国家会把他看作恩人，在国会大厦中向这位国宾欢呼致谢；也没有国家会为他造起一艘战舰，以纪念他的伤疤和英勇。我们不妨设想他还在人世，并且来到我们的土地上访问，与我们共同欢庆今日。这位国宾是星条旗的骄傲，然而从日出时分金光四射的海岸，到日落时分霞光万丈的海滨，都没有国家派出船舶接送他。这位幸运儿是自由的卫士，无论在欧洲亦或美国，却也不会有大炮在战场上用严酷的方式向他致敬。军乐在大西洋上飘荡，回响在密西西比的河谷之中，然而没有一首会用欢天喜地的音符对他表示欢迎。军事游行上军旗招展，军人们挂满勋章，佩剑和刺刀闪闪发光，然而没有哪一场游行会在水泄不通的大街上宣告他的到来。没有城市会召来淑女名媛、达官显贵，在舞厅和剧院向他致敬。没有哪个国家会从一处国境把他护送至另一处国境，也不会派他们的最高长官向他表示敬意。</p>
<p>在朝圣者的国土，在宾夕法尼亚州，在天主教、保皇党和胡格诺教徒的土地上，罗伯特·莱格斯都不会受到这样的款待。谁会因为这位基督教先驱、主日学校的创办者无法受到如此礼遇而感到不快呢？他的使者会是福音的布道者，还有那些无比虔敬、慈悲而热诚的人们。他的队伍按身份排列，有十字架的使者、救世主的门徒、主日学校的老师和身着白袍的学者。圣主的教堂就是见证他得胜的景象。对他的敬意和感激，就是献给上帝的赞美诗和感恩祈祷。</p>
<p>父母对他的尊敬甚于对待兄长，孩子们对他的崇敬也超越了对待父亲的。老人喃喃的低语，成年人坚定而冷静的声音，年轻人银铃般的嗓子，都祝福他这位基督教的卫士。他作为一个和平的使者，来到了一片和平的土地。无论他身在何处，明智而善良的人们都会把他看作是爱国者和国家的恩人，甚至在异域也是如此。人们不会看到军营、围攻、战斗的一幕幕景象，亦不会有死去和受伤的剧痛；在迎接他的人群那儿，也没有胜利的呼喊和凯旋的游行可留下回忆。他们不会为共同经过的重重危险、层层考验和大灾大难而哀悼，因为对于他们来说，使命之路就是一条快乐的路，一条宁静的路。他们对过去的回忆充满了对上帝的感激，对人类的热爱；他们享受这当下的生活，作为天国极乐的前奏。他们的前景一片光明灿烂，如同他们的信念和希望。</p>
<p>人们这般欢迎了勇士拉斐德，又那般欢迎了基督教堂的霍华德——罗伯特·莱格斯。哪一位才是更为高尚的施恩者、爱国者和慈善家呢？比起主日学校的创办者，拉斐德也许更能得到人们的钦佩和赞美；然而从宗教、博爱和文明的常识而言，罗伯特·莱格斯无疑比拉斐德更胜一筹。罗伯特·莱格斯的美德、奉献和牺牲对生命本身而言是更为持久而崇高的。他的忠告和成就超越时间，成为永恒。</p>
<p>拉斐德的声望属于此生，罗伯特·莱格斯的荣耀属于救世主那永恒的国度。拉斐德的一生主要是奉献给他的时代，奉献给他的、亦即我们的国家，然而罗伯特·莱格斯的一生是奉献给永恒和全世界的。历史学家和传记作家也许永远不会把他的名字载入史册；然而每一个教堂的记录册都会给予他守护神的荣耀，人间与天上的普世教会都会将他奉为恩人。</p>
<p>也许有一天拉斐德这个名字将被人们遗忘，或者他的名望之星不再闪耀在高高的天顶，只在地平线的边缘上发出黯淡的微光。然而罗伯特·莱格斯的名字将永远铭记在人们心中，他的荣耀散发出摇曳的火光，这是从天堂汹涌而降、吞噬了以利亚祭品（出自《圣经》典故，以利亚为先知之一，成功求神耶和华从天降下天火烧尽燔祭，让耶和华的威信得以确立）的永恒之火。相较罗伯特·莱格斯而言，就让拉斐德获得更多凡人的赞美并仿效吧。然而公义带来圆满，围绕上帝宝座周围的那些牧师之灵将会接纳他，视他为虔诚侍奉同一圣主的伙伴，视他为救赎人类的荣耀大业中辛勤工作的同胞，视他为一同承接那珍贵诺言和永恒犒赏的继承者。</p>

<p>FALL OF CARDINAL WOLSEY</p>
<p>沃尔西 (1) 主教的垮台</p>
<p>Wolsey. Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!</p>
<p>This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth</p>
<p>The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,</p>
<p>And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;</p>
<p>The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,</p>
<p>And, when he thinks, good, easy man, full surely</p>
<p>His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,</p>
<p>And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,</p>
<p>Like little, wanton boys that swim on bladders,</p>
<p>This many summers in a sea of glory,</p>
<p>But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride</p>
<p>At length broke under me, and now has left me,</p>
<p>Weary and old with service, to the mercy</p>
<p>Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.</p>
<p>Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:</p>
<p>I feel my heart new open’d. Oh, how wretched</p>
<p>Is that poor man that hangs on princes’ favors!</p>
<p>There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,</p>
<p>That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,</p>
<p>More pangs and fears than wars or women have:</p>
<p>And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,</p>
<p>Never to hope again.</p>
<p>Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed.</p>
<p>Why, how now, Cromwell!</p>
<p>Crom. I have no power to speak, sir.</p>
<p>Wol. What, amazed</p>
<p>At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder,</p>
<p>A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,</p>
<p>I am fall’n indeed.</p>
<p>Crom. How does your grace?</p>
<p>Wol. Why, well;</p>
<p>Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.</p>
<p>I know myself now; and I fed within me</p>
<p>A peace above all earthly dignities,</p>
<p>A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,</p>
<p>I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,</p>
<p>These ruin’d pillars, out of pity, taken</p>
<p>A load would sink a navy!—too much honor:</p>
<p>Oh, ’t is a burthen, Cromwell, ’T is a burthen,</p>
<p>Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!</p>
<p>Crom. I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.</p>
<p>Wol. I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,</p>
<p>Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,</p>
<p>To endure more miseries, and greater far,</p>
<p>Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.</p>
<p>What news abroad?</p>
<p>Crom. The heaviest, and the worst,</p>
<p>Is your displeasure with the king.</p>
<p>Wol. God bless him!</p>
<p>Crom. The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen</p>
<p>Lord chancellor in your place.</p>
<p>Wol. That’s somewhat sudden:</p>
<p>But he’s a learned man. May he continue</p>
<p>Long in his highness’ favor, and do justice</p>
<p>For truth’s sake and his conscience; that his bones,</p>
<p>When he has run his course, and sleeps in blessings,</p>
<p>May have a tomb of orphans’ tears wept on ’em!</p>
<p>What more?</p>
<p>Crom. That Cranmer is return’d with welcome,</p>
<p>Install’d lord archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
<p>Wol. That’s news indeed!</p>
<p>Crom. Last, that the Lady Anne,</p>
<p>Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,</p>
<p>This day was viewed in open as his queen,</p>
<p>Going to chapel; and the voice is now</p>
<p>Only about her coronation.</p>
<p>Wol. There was the weight that pull’d me down. O Cromwell,</p>
<p>The king has gone beyond me: all my glories</p>
<p>In that one woman I have lost forever:</p>
<p>No sun shall ever usher forth mine honors,</p>
<p>Or gild again the noble troops that waited</p>
<p>Upon my smiles. Go! get thee from me! Cromwell;</p>
<p>I am a poor, fall’n man, unworthy now</p>
<p>To be thy lord and master: seek the king;</p>
<p>That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him</p>
<p>What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;</p>
<p>Some little memory of me will stir him—</p>
<p>I know his noble nature—not to let</p>
<p>Thy hopeful service perish, too: good Cromwell,</p>
<p>Neglect him not; make use now, and provide</p>
<p>For thine own future safety.</p>
<p>Crom. O my lord,</p>
<p>Must I, then, leave you? Must I needs forego</p>
<p>So good, so noble, and so true a master?</p>
<p>Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,</p>
<p>With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.</p>
<p>The king shall have my service; but my prayers</p>
<p>Forever and forever shall be yours.</p>
<p>Wol. Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear</p>
<p>In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,</p>
<p>Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.</p>
<p>Let’s dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;</p>
<p>And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,</p>
<p>And sleep in dull, cold marble, where no mention</p>
<p>Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee;</p>
<p>Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,</p>
<p>And sounded all the depths and shoals of honor,</p>
<p>Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;</p>
<p>A sure and safe one, though thy master missed it.</p>
<p>Mark but my fall, and that that ruin’d me.</p>
<p>Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:</p>
<p>By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,</p>
<p>The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?</p>
<p>Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;</p>
<p>Corruption wins not more than honesty.</p>
<p>Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,</p>
<p>To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:</p>
<p>Let all the ends thou aim’st at be thy country’s,</p>
<p>Thy God’s, and truth’s; then, if thou fall’st, O Cromwell,</p>
<p>Thou fall’st, a blessed martyr! Serve the king;</p>
<p>And,—prithee, lead me in:</p>
<p>There, take an inventory of all I have,</p>
<p>To the last penny; ’t is the king’s: my robe,</p>
<p>And my integrity to Heaven, is all</p>
<p>I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!</p>
<p>Had I but served my God with half the zeal</p>
<p>I served my king, He would not in mine age</p>
<p>Have left me naked to mine enemies.</p>
<p>Crom. Good sir, have patience.</p>
<p>Wol. So I have. Farewell</p>
<p>The hopes of court! my hopes in Heaven do dwell.</p>

<p>克伦威尔上，伫立，表示惊愕。</p>
<p>沃 尔 西 怎么样？什么事，克伦威尔？</p>
<p>克伦威尔 先生，我简直没有说话的力气了。</p>
<p>沃 尔 西 怎么，被我的不幸吓呆了？以你这样的智力，</p>
<p>见到伟大人物的衰败也竟感到吃惊吗？好了好了，你如果一哭，那我可真是失败了。</p>
<p>克伦威尔 大人感觉怎样？</p>
<p>沃 尔 西 很好，我的好克伦威尔，从来没有像现在这样真正幸福过。</p>
<p>我现在了解我自己了，</p>
<p>我感到在我内心里有一种平静，远非人间一切尊荣所能比拟，</p>
<p>是一种宁静安详的感觉。国王把我医治好了，</p>
<p>我衷心感谢他；他出于怜悯之心，从我这两个肩头，</p>
<p>这两根坍塌了的柱石上，把一副重担卸下，我承受的荣誉太重了，足以压沉一个舰队。</p>
<p>克伦威尔，那真是负担哪，真是负担哪，</p>
<p>对于一个向往天堂的人来说，是太沉重了。</p>
<p>克伦威尔 我很高兴大人对待这种负担处理得如此正确。</p>
<p>沃 尔 西 我希望我做到了这一点；</p>
<p>我觉得，由于灵魂坚强了，</p>
<p>我现在似乎也能够忍受那些比我怯懦的敌人</p>
<p>所敢于加在我身上的更多更大的苦难。</p>
<p>外边有什么新闻么？</p>
<p>克伦威尔 最痛心的、最坏的新闻</p>
<p>就是您失去国王恩宠的事。</p>
<p>沃 尔 西 愿上帝降福给他。</p>
<p>克伦威尔 其次，托马斯·摩尔爵士已被遴选为首相，</p>
<p>代替您的地位。</p>
<p>沃 尔 西 这倒有些出乎意外，</p>
<p>但是他是个博学之士，我愿他</p>
<p>长久受到皇上的恩宠，</p>
<p>按照真理和他的良心办正义的事；</p>
<p>我愿他在完成了他的途程、在祝福声中长眠之后，</p>
<p>他的尸骨能够埋到坟墓里，有孤儿的泪洒在他的墓上。</p>
<p>还有什么？</p>
<p>克伦威尔 克兰默回国了，受到了欢迎，</p>
<p>并晋封为坎特伯雷大主教。</p>
<p>沃 尔 西 这倒真是新闻。</p>
<p>克伦威尔 最后，安妮夫人早已和国王秘密结了婚，</p>
<p>今天在上教堂作礼拜去的时候，作为王后公开出面了，</p>
<p>现在大家都在谈论的只是她的加冕问题了。</p>
<p>沃 尔 西 那就是把我拖下水底的秤砣。克伦威尔啊，</p>
<p>国王跑在我的前边了。</p>
<p>就因为这一个女人，我把我所有的光荣都输了出去，再也赢不回来了。</p>
<p>太阳升起，但它永远也迎接不到我的荣誉了，</p>
<p>它再也不会给那一大批等候我向他们微笑的贵族们镀上一层金了。</p>
<p>克伦威尔，你离开我吧，我已经是个可怜的、失败的人，</p>
<p>不配再作</p>
<p>你的主人和东家。你去找国王吧，</p>
<p>他是太阳，我祝这颗太阳永远不落；我已经告诉过他，</p>
<p>你是什么人，你如何忠实，他会提拔你的。</p>
<p>我知他天性高贵，只要他能够想起我一点影子来，</p>
<p>他会有所感触，不会让</p>
<p>你的希望和劳力也落空的。好克伦威尔，</p>
<p>不可忽略他；要利用现在的时机，</p>
<p>为你自己未来的安全作好准备。</p>
<p>克伦威尔 大人，难道我非离开您不可了吗？非得</p>
<p>放弃这么一位尊贵、真实的好主人了吗？</p>
<p>一切不是铁石心肠的人，请你们作证，</p>
<p>我克伦威尔离开我的主人，心里有多难过。</p>
<p>我一定去为国王效劳；但是我永远永远要为您祝祷。</p>
<p>沃 尔 西
克伦威尔，我的苦难虽然很大，但我本没打算流一滴眼泪，但是你这番恳切而真诚的心意却迫使我扮演起女人的角色了。</p>
<p>让我们擦干了眼泪，克伦威尔，听我再说几句。</p>
<p>等我终有一天被人遗忘了的时候，等我安睡在没有感觉的、冷冰冰的石头棺材里，</p>
<p>再也听不见人们提到我的时候，你可以对人说我曾教导过你，</p>
<p>说沃尔西曾一度踏遍了光荣的道路，</p>
<p>勘探过荣誉的全部深渊和浅滩，</p>
<p>从他的遇难的残骸里为你找到了一条上进之路，</p>
<p>是一条稳妥安全的路，虽然你主人自己没有能走上。</p>
<p>你只消注意我是怎样失败的，是什么使我毁灭的。</p>
<p>克伦威尔，你一定要听我的嘱咐，把野心抛掉，</p>
<p>天使们就是因为犯了野心的罪而堕落的，而人</p>
<p>不过是他的创造主的影像，岂能希望通过野心而得到胜利？</p>
<p>爱你自己要爱在最后，珍爱那些恨你的人，</p>
<p>诚实比起腐败会给你赢得更多的好处。</p>
<p>在你的右手里永远举着温顺的和平枝，</p>
<p>免得嫉妒之徒说闲话。做人要公正，不要怕；</p>
<p>你所要达到的一切目的应该是你的国家、上帝和真理所要达到的目的，这以后，你如果还是失败了，那么，克伦威尔，</p>
<p>你的失败也不愧是一个殉教者的失败，会受到祝福的。为国王效劳吧。</p>
<p>请你领我进去，</p>
<p>把我所有的一切直到最后一个便士开出一份清册来，</p>
<p>这些都是国王的。</p>
<p>我敢于认为是我自己的财产的东西只有这件袍子和我对上帝的一片诚心了。</p>
<p>唉，克伦威尔，克伦威尔！</p>
<p>如果我把为国王效劳的热诚，用一半来侍奉我的上帝，他也不会在我垂老之年把我赤条条地丢给我的敌人了。</p>
<p>克伦威尔 好大人，忍耐些。</p>
<p>沃 尔 西 我是在忍耐。别了</p>
<p>宫廷中升迁的希望，我的希望在天堂上了。</p>

<h2 id="lesson-40-3">LESSON 40</h2>
<p>THE PHILOSOPHER</p>
<p>哲学家</p>
<p>John P. Kennedy, 1796-1870. This gentleman, eminent in American
politics and literature, was born in Baltimore, graduated at the College
of Baltimore, and died in the same city. He served several years in the
Legislature of his native state, and three terms in the United States
House of Representatives. He was Secretary of the Navy during a part of
President Fillmore’s administration, and was active in sending out the
famous Japan expedition, and Dr. Kane’s expedition in search of Sir John
Franklin. Mr. Kennedy wrote several novels, as well as political and
other papers. His writings are marked by ease and freshness, The
following extract is from “Swallow Barn,” a series of sketches of early
Virginia.</p>
<p>From the house at Swallow Barn there is to be seen, at no great
distance, a clump of trees, and in the midst of these a humble building
is discernible, that seems to court the shade in which it is modestly
embowered. It is an old structure built of logs. Its figure is a cube,
with a roof rising from all sides to a point, and surmounted by a wooden
weathercock, which somewhat resembles a fish and somewhat a fowl.</p>
<p>This little edifice is a rustic shrine devoted to Cadmus, and is
under the dominion of parson Chub. He is a plump, rosy old gentleman,
rather short and thickset, with the blood vessels meandering over his
face like rivulets,—a pair of prominent blue eyes, and a head of silky
hair not unlike the covering of a white spaniel. He may be said to be a
man of jolly dimensions, with an evident taste for good living,
sometimes sloven in his attire, for his coat—which is not of the
newest—is decorated with sundry spots that are scattered over it in
constellations. Besides this, he wears an immense cravat, which, as it
is wreathed around his short neck, forms a bowl beneath his chin, and—as
Ned says—gives the parson’s head the appearance of that of John the
Baptist upon a charger, as it is sometimes represented in the children’s
picture books. His beard is grizzled with silver stubble, which the
parson reaps about twice a week—if the weather be fair.</p>
<p>Mr. Chub is a philosopher after the order of Socrates. He was an
emigrant from the Emerald Isle, where he suffered much tribulation in
the disturbances, as they are mildly called, of his much-enduring
country. But the old gentleman has weathered the storm without losing a
jot of that broad, healthy benevolence with which Nature has enveloped
his heart, and whose ensign she has hoisted in his face. The early part
of his life had been easy and prosperous, until the rebellion of 1798
stimulated his republicanism into a fever, and drove the full-blooded
hero headlong into a quarrel, and put him, in spite of his peaceful
profession, to standing by his pike in behalf of his principles. By this
unhappy boiling over of the caldron of his valor, he fell under the ban
of the ministers, and tested his share of government mercy. His house
was burnt over his head, his horses and hounds (for, by all accounts, he
was a perfect Actaeon) were “confiscate to the state,” and he was forced
to fly. This brought him to America in no very compromising mood with
royalty.</p>
<p>Here his fortunes appear to have been various, and he was tossed to
and fro by the battledoor of fate, until he found a snug harbor at
Swallow Barn; where, some years ago, he sat down in that quiet repose
which a worried and badgered patriot is best fitted to enjoy.</p>
<p>He is a good scholar, and, having confined his readings entirely to
the learning of the ancients, his republicanism is somewhat after the
Grecian mold. He has never read any politics of later date than the time
of the Emperor Constantine, not even a newspaper,—so that he may be said
to have been contemporary with AEschines rather than Lord
Castlereagh—until that eventful epoch of his life when his blazing
rooftree awakened him from his anachronistical dream. This notable
interruption, however, gave him but a feeble insight into the moderns,
and he soon relapsed to Thucydides and Livy, with some such glimmerings
of the American Revolution upon his remembrance as most readers have of
the exploits of the first Brutus.</p>
<p>The old gentleman had a learned passion for folios. He had been a
long time urging Meriwether to make some additions to his collections of
literature, and descanted upon the value of some of the ancient authors
as foundations, both moral and physical, to the library. Frank gave way
to the argument, partly to gratify the parson, and partly from the
proposition itself having a smack that touched his fancy. The matter was
therefore committed entirely to Mr. Chub, who forthwith set out on a
voyage of exploration to the north. I believe he got as far as Boston.
He certainly contrived to execute his commission with a curious
felicity. Some famous Elzevirs were picked up, and many other antiques
that nobody but Mr. Chub would ever think of opening.</p>
<p>The cargo arrived at Swallow Burn in the dead of winter. During the
interval between the parson’s return from his expedition and the coming
of the books, the reverend little schoolmaster was in a remarkably
unquiet state of body, which almost prevented him from sleeping: and it
is said that the sight of the long-expected treasures had the happiest
effect upon him. There was ample accommodation for this new acquisition
of ancient wisdom provided before its arrival, and Mr. Chub now spent a
whole week in arranging the volumes on their proper shelves, having, as
report affirms, altered the arrangement at least seven times during that
period. Everybody wondered what the old gentleman was at, all this time;
but it was discovered afterwards, that he was endeavoring to effect a
distribution of the works according to a minute division of human
science, which entirely failed, owing to the unlucky accident of several
of his departments being without any volumes.</p>
<p>After this matter was settled, he regularly spent his evenings in the
library. Frank Meriwether was hardly behind the parson in this fancy,
and took, for a short time, to abstruse reading. They both consequently
deserted the little family circle every evening after tea, and might
have continued to do so all the winter but for a discovery made by
Hazard.</p>
<p>Ned had seldom joined the two votaries of science in their
philosophical retirement, and it was whispered in the family that the
parson was giving Frank a quiet course of lectures in the ancient
philosophy, for Meriwether was known to talk a great deal, about that
time, of the old and new Academicians. But it happened upon one dreary
winter night, during a tremendous snowstorm, which was banging the
shutters and doors of the house so as to keep up a continual uproar,
that Ned, having waited in the parlor for the philosophers until
midnight, set out to invade their retreat—not doubting that he should
find them deep in study. When he entered the library, both candles were
burning in their sockets, with long, untrimmed wicks; the fire was
reduced to its last embers, and, in an armchair on one side of the
table, the parson was discovered in a sound sleep over Jeremy Taylor’s
“Ductor Dubitantium,” whilst Frank, in another chair on the opposite
side, was snoring over a folio edition of Montaigne. And upon the table
stood a small stone pitcher, containing a residuum of whisky punch, now
grown cold. Frank started up in great consternation upon hearing Ned’s
footstep beside him, and, from that time, almost entirely deserted the
library. Mr. Chub, however, was not so easily drawn away from the career
of his humor, and still shows his hankering after his leather-coated
friends.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-487">中文阅读</h4>
<p>从坐落在燕子谷仓的那栋房子往外看，不远处有一个树丛，树丛之中隐约可见一座简陋的建筑，它与四周融为一体，又似乎在向浓密的树阴暗送秋波。这是一栋用原木搭建的老建筑，外形看上去是个上面搭着尖顶的立方体，尖顶上竖着木质的风标，那风标看起来像一条鱼，又像一只鸟。</p>
<p>这座小小的建筑是木制的圣殿，为供奉希腊神卡德摩斯而建，归教区牧师察布的管辖。牧师是位胖乎乎的老先生，脸色红润，个头矮小而四肢粗短，脸上蜿蜒交错的血管清晰可辨，一双明亮的蓝眼睛，一头银白色的头发有点儿像那种白色西班牙猎犬身上的皮毛。他可称得上是个快活的人，懂得享受生活，有时显得不修边幅，因为他那件算不上新的大衣上面，总是星星点点地散布着各种各样的污渍。除此之外，他还戴着一条很大的围巾，那围巾缠绕着他短短的脖子，在他下巴底下堆成了一个碗的形状——正如奈德所说，这让牧师的头看起来活像圣徒约翰骑在战马上的形象，有时在儿童的图画书里会看到他的身影。他的胡须斑白，剪得短短的，牧师一个星期就替他收割两回——要是天气好的话。</p>
<p>察布是一位苏格拉底派的哲人。他是来自翡翠岛，即爱尔兰岛的一位移民，他的国家动荡不安，他个人也是在其中饱经忧患——这还算是较温和的说法。然而这位老先生已经挺过了那些风暴，然而自然女神赋予他那宽阔的胸襟、善良的本性分毫不改，亦让他的面容看起来也充满了善意。他早年生活安逸而富裕，直到1798年的起义爆发，让他的共和主义信念变得狂热，这位热血沸腾的英雄一头扎进争论之中；尽管他从事的是和平的职业，却由此拿起了他的长矛来捍卫他的信条。他的英勇怒火就此不幸地燃烧起来，于是他被剥夺了从事神职的资格，政府对他的容忍程度也受到了考验。他眼睁睁地看着自己的家被火烧光，他的马和猎犬（因此人人都说他活生生就是希腊神话里头的猎人亚克托安，让女神化为鹿，被自己的猎犬分尸而死
）就被“充公”，他不得不走上逃亡的道路。他就这样来到美国，与爱尔兰皇族一直誓不两立。</p>
<p>在此地，他似乎是时来运转了。他一直被命运的转轮抛来抛去，直到他终于在燕子谷仓觅得了一个避风港。几年之前，他就在此处安居下来，对于一位忧心忡忡、麻烦缠身的爱国者来说，这安宁平静的生活是最合适不过了。</p>
<p>他是一位优秀的学者，他阅读的全部是古人的著作，因此他的共和主义颇有古希腊的遗风。他阅读的政治著作里没有年代晚于康斯坦丁大帝的，而且甚至连一张报纸也不看——因此与其说他是卡斯尔雷勋爵的同辈人，不如说他是埃斯奇纳斯那个时代的——直到他的人生来到了那个多变之秋，他那熊熊燃烧的家园让他从时代错位的幻梦之中惊醒。这场重大变故却仅仅让他对当下有了粗浅的了解，很快他又故态复萌，回到修西得底斯和李维的世界；美国独立战争亦只让他对自身的相似经历有零星的回忆，如同绝大多数读者记起暗杀凯撒大帝的布鲁特斯一般。</p>
<p>这位老先生酷爱用对开本做学问。他一直在催促弗兰克·梅里威瑟为他的文学藏书再补充几批书籍，并且不厌其烦地强调，古代作者无论是探讨道德还是自然规律的作品，对于藏书室来说都具有重要的基础价值。这次争论中弗兰克做了让步，部分原因是他想让牧师高兴，另一些原因是这个提议本身就与他的喜好不谋而合。于是增添藏书这件事就完全交给了察布先生，他即刻动身出海前往北方探查。我相信他一直走到了波士顿。他选了一些有名的艾尔泽菲尔版图书，还有其他许多的古籍——除了察布先生，那些书没人曾想过要打开来看一眼。</p>
<p>运送这批古籍的图书在隆冬时节到达了燕子谷仓。从牧师考察回来到书籍运达之间有一段时间，这位身材矮小、受人尊敬的导师坐立不安，几乎夜不成寐；据说他看到那批盼望已久的宝贝时是高兴至极。在古籍运达之前，已经为这批新购得的古代智慧结晶留出了宽敞的存放空间；如今察布先生用了整整一周的时间，把一册册的书分门别类摆放到书架上。据传闻，他在这段时间内至少把书重新排列整理了七遍，期间没有人知道老先生想要干什么，后来才发现，他是费尽心思想把书籍按照人文学科细致分类，但他的努力完全失败了，原因是他划分的好些人文领域连一本书也没有。</p>
<p>此事安排妥当以后，他的夜晚就常常在藏书室里度过。弗兰克·梅里威瑟对藏书室的迷恋几乎不比牧师少，他一度沉迷于阅读深奥难懂的书籍。于是每晚用茶过后，他们都不约而同地放弃了家庭小聚，也许整个冬天都会这样继续泡在藏书室里，而全部时间只是为了研读哈泽德的一个发现。</p>
<p>他们隐遁在哲学之中，期间奈德极少打扰这两位科学的信徒。家族里传言说，牧师给弗兰克上了一系列平和的古代哲学课，于是弗兰克那时说起由古至今的哲人就滔滔不绝。一个阴沉的冬日夜晚，屋外暴风雪肆虐，不断咆哮着，把百叶窗和门打得啪啪作响。奈德在客厅里等这两位哲学家，一直等到了半夜时分，终于闯入了他们的隐遁之地——毫无疑问，他果然发现两位哲学家正沉浸在他们的“学习”之中。当他走进藏书室时，烛台上的两根蜡烛正在燃烧，长长的烛芯也未来得及修剪；炉火只剩下微弱的余烬，桌子一侧的扶手椅上，牧师正埋首在耶利米·泰勒那本《法治的良心》中呼呼大睡，而弗兰克正坐在他对面的椅子上，冲着对开本的《蒙田选集》打呼噜。桌子上放着一个石制的水罐，里面还剩下一点儿威士忌调成的鸡尾酒，如今已变得冰凉。弗兰克听到奈德的脚步声在他旁边出现，大惊失色地一跃而起，从此以后就几乎再也不到藏书室里来了。然而，察布先生却不会轻易从他所热爱的事业之中抽身而出，如今仍继续追寻着他那些皮革封面包裹之下的朋友。</p>

<p>MARMION AND DOUGLAS</p>
<p>马米恩和道格拉斯</p>
<p>Not far advanced was morning day,</p>
<p>When Marmion did his troop array</p>
<p>To Surrey’s camp to ride;</p>
<p>He had safe conduct for his band,</p>
<p>Beneath the royal seal and hand,</p>
<p>And Douglas gave a guide.</p>
<p>The train from out the castle drew,</p>
<p>But Marmion stopped to bid adieu:</p>
<p>“Though something I might plain,” he said,</p>
<p>“Of cold respect to stranger guest,</p>
<p>Sent hither by your king’s behest,</p>
<p>While in Tantallon’s towers I staid,</p>
<p>Part we in friendship from your land,</p>
<p>And, noble Earl, receive my hand.”</p>
<p>But Douglas round him drew his cloak,</p>
<p>Folded his arms, and thus he spoke:</p>
<p>“My manors, halls, and bowers shall still</p>
<p>Be open, at my sovereign’s will,</p>
<p>To each one whom he lists, howe’er</p>
<p>Unmeet to be the owner’s peer.</p>
<p>My castles are my king’s alone,</p>
<p>From turret to foundation stone;</p>
<p>The hand of Douglas is his own;</p>
<p>And never shall, in friendly grasp,</p>
<p>The hand of such as Marmion clasp.”</p>
<p>Burned Marmion’s swarthy cheek like fire,</p>
<p>And shook his very frame for ire;</p>
<p>And— “This to me!” he said,—</p>
<p>“An ’t were not for thy hoary beard,</p>
<p>Such hand as Marmion’s had not spared</p>
<p>To cleave the Douglas’ head!</p>
<p>And, first, I tell thee, haughty peer,</p>
<p>He who does England’s message here,</p>
<p>Although the meanest in her state,</p>
<p>May well, proud Angus, be thy mate:</p>
<p>And, Douglas, more, I tell thee here,</p>
<p>Even in thy pitch of pride,</p>
<p>Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near,</p>
<p>I tell thee, thou’rt defied!</p>
<p>And if thou said’st I am not peer</p>
<p>To any lord in Scotland here,</p>
<p>Lowland or Highland, far or near,</p>
<p>Lord Angus, thou hast lied!”</p>
<p>On the Earl’s cheek the flush of rage</p>
<p>O’ ercame the ashen hue of age.</p>
<p>Fierce he broke forth,—“And dar’st thou then</p>
<p>To beard the lion in his den,</p>
<p>The Douglas in his hall?</p>
<p>And hop’st thou hence unscathed to go?</p>
<p>No, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, no!</p>
<p>Up drawbridge, grooms,—what, warder, ho!</p>
<p>Let the portcullis fall.”</p>
<p>Lord Marmion turned,—well was his need,—</p>
<p>And dashed the rowels in his steed,</p>
<p>Like arrow through the archway sprung;</p>
<p>The ponderous gate behind him rung:</p>
<p>To pass there was such scanty room,</p>
<p>The bars, descending, razed his plume.</p>
<p>The steed along the drawbridge flies,</p>
<p>Just as it trembled on the rise;</p>
<p>Nor lighter does the swallow skim</p>
<p>Along the smooth lake’s level brim:</p>
<p>And when Lord Marmion reached his band</p>
<p>He halts, and turns with clenched hand,</p>
<p>And shout of loud defiance pours,</p>
<p>And shook his gauntlet at the towers.</p>
<p>“Horse! horse!” the Douglas cried, “and chase!”</p>
<p>But soon he reined his fury’s pace:</p>
<p>“A royal messenger he came,</p>
<p>Though most unworthy of the name.</p>
<p>Saint Mary mend my fiery mood!</p>
<p>Old age ne’er cools the Douglas’ blood;</p>
<p>I thought to slay him where he stood.</p>
<p>’T is pity of him, too,” he cried;</p>
<p>“Bold he can speak, and fairly ride;</p>
<p>I warrant him a warrior tried.”</p>
<p>With this his mandate he recalls,</p>
<p>And slowly seeks his castle halls.</p>

<p>拂晓将至，</p>
<p>马米恩的骑兵部署在</p>
<p>萨里营地，准备出发，</p>
<p>他带着皇家封印大手一挥</p>
<p>即可指引他的部队安全无恙，</p>
<p>还有道格拉斯为他指明方向。</p>
<p>城堡外的这一列人马已经启程，</p>
<p>但马米恩停下来与主人告别：</p>
<p>“有件事情我心里清楚，”他声言，</p>
<p>“对奉你国王之命派遣至此的</p>
<p>远方来客，你只表示冷淡的尊重，</p>
<p>当我驻守在坦特伦城堡的时候。</p>
<p>让我们在你的土地上友好地道别，</p>
<p>请你接过我的手，尊贵的伯爵。”</p>
<p>但道格拉斯拉了拉身上披的斗篷，</p>
<p>把双臂合拢，然后开口：</p>
<p>“我的领地、厅堂和别馆，</p>
<p>应我君主的意志，为他所列出的</p>
<p>每个客人——那与主人</p>
<p>并不相配的，始终大门开敞。</p>
<p>我的城堡完全属于我的国王，</p>
<p>从塔楼到每一块做地基的石头；</p>
<p>道格拉斯的手属于他自己所有，</p>
<p>将永远不会友好地握住，</p>
<p>像马米恩这样的手。”</p>
<p>马米恩黑黝黝的两颊燃烧如火，</p>
<p>他的身体愤怒得发抖。</p>
<p>“竟敢这么待我！”他说，</p>
<p>“要不是你已须鬓斑白，</p>
<p>像马米恩这样的手，</p>
<p>就毫不留情劈开道格拉斯的头！</p>
<p>首先，我要告诉你，不可一世的朋友，</p>
<p>在此处为英国传递消息的人，</p>
<p>即便在他祖国里是最为低劣的货色，</p>
<p>骄傲的安格斯，当你的伙伴也足矣。</p>
<p>道格拉斯，我还要告诉你，</p>
<p>即便你发出傲慢的声音，</p>
<p>在这里，在你的领地，你的奴仆就在附近，</p>
<p>我也要告诉你，我藐视你！</p>
<p>倘若你说我的身份配不上</p>
<p>苏格兰这儿任何一位领主，</p>
<p>无论远近，低地还是高地，</p>
<p>安格斯领主，你都是胡言乱语！”</p>
<p>伯爵的脸上泛起愤怒的红光，</p>
<p>盖过了岁月留下的苍白模样。</p>
<p>暴跳如雷的他咆哮道：“你竟敢</p>
<p>在狮子洞里把狮子的胡须拨弄？</p>
<p>在道格拉斯的会堂里把他挑逗？</p>
<p>而你竟希望能毫发无伤地遁走？</p>
<p>不，以圣徒新娘 (1) ——苏格兰女皇之名，不！</p>
<p>上吊桥，马夫、看守，小心伺候！</p>
<p>令吊闸落下。”</p>
<p>马米恩勋爵转身——一派从容——</p>
<p>在战马上猛地把齿轮掷出，</p>
<p>箭一般飞跃过拱门，</p>
<p>沉重的大门在他身后砰一声响：</p>
<p>那窄窄的空间几乎无法通过</p>
<p>门闸掉下，把他的帽翎碰落在地。</p>
<p>战马沿着吊桥飞驰，</p>
<p>此时它正颤动着升起，</p>
<p>掠过平滑的湖边的飞燕</p>
<p>也比不上战马的轻盈。</p>
<p>勋爵马米恩来到他的部队前面，</p>
<p>他停下脚步，转身攥紧拳头，</p>

<p>THE BAPTISM</p>
<p>洗礼</p>
<p>John Wilson, 1785-1854, a distinguished Scottish author, was born at
Paisley. When fifteen years of age, he entered the University of
Glasgow; but, three years later, he became a member of Magdalen College,
Oxford. Here he attained eminence both as a student, and as a proficient
in gymnastic games and exercises. Soon after graduating, he purchased an
estate near Lake Windermere, and became a companion of Wordsworth and
Southey; but he soon left his estate to reside in Edinburgh. In 1817,
when “Blackwood’s Magazine” was established in opposition to the
“Edinburgh Review,” he became chief contributor to that famous
periodical. In its pages, he won his chief fame as a writer. In 1820, he
succeeded Dr. Thomas Brown as Professor of Moral Philosophy in the
University of Edinburgh; this position he held for thirty years. His
“Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life” was published in 1822. This is a
collection of pathetic and beautiful tales of domestic life in Scotland.
His contributions to Blackwood appeared over the pseudonym of
“Christopher North,” or more familiarly, “Kit North.” Professor Wilson
was a man of great physical power and of striking appearance. In
character, he was vehement and impulsive; but his writings show that he
possessed feelings of deep tenderness.</p>
<p>The rite of baptism had not been performed for several months in the
kirk of Lanark. It was now the hottest time of persecution; and the
inhabitants of that parish found other places in which to worship God,
and celebrate the ordinances of religion. It was now the Sabbath day,
and a small congregation of about a hundred souls had met for divine
service, in a place more magnificent than any temple that human hands
had ever built to Deity. The congregation had not assembled to the toll
of the bell, but each heart knew the hour and observed it; for there are
a hundred sundials among the hills, woods, moors, and fields; and the
shepherd and the peasant see the hours passing by them in sunshine and
shadow.</p>
<p>The church in which they were assembled, was hewn by God’s hand out
of the eternal rock. A river rolled its way through a mighty chasm of
cliffs, several hundred feet high, of which the one side presented
enormous masses, and the other corresponding recesses, as if the great
stone girdle had been rent by a convulsion. The channel was overspread
with prodigious fragments of rocks or large loose stones, some of them
smooth and bare, others containing soil and verdure in their rents and
fissures, and here and there crowned with shrubs and trees. The eye
could at once command a long-stretching vista, seemingly closed and shut
up at both extremities by the coalescing cliffs. This majestic reach of
river contained pools, streams, and waterfalls innumerable; and when the
water was low—which was now the case, in the common drought—it was easy
to walk up this scene with the calm, blue sky overhead, an utter and
sublime solitude.</p>
<p>On looking up, the soul was bowed down by the feeling of that
prodigious height of unscalable, and often overhanging, cliff. Between
the channel and the summit of the far extended precipices, were
perpetually flying rooks and wood pigeons, and now and then a hawk,
filling the profound abyss with their wild cawing, deep murmur, or
shrilly shriek. Sometimes a heron would stand erect and still, on some
little stone island, or rise up like a white cloud along the black walls
of the chasm, and disappear. Winged creatures alone could inhabit this
region. The fox and wild cat chose more accessible haunts. Yet, here
came the persecuted Christians and worshiped God, whose hand hung over
their head those magnificent pillars and arches, scooped out those
galleries from the solid rock, and laid at their feet the calm water, in
its transparent beauty, in which they could see themselves sitting, in
reflected groups, with their Bibles in their hands.</p>
<p>Here, upon a semicircular ledge of rocks, over a narrow chasm, of
which the tiny stream played in a murmuring waterfall, and divided the
congregation into two equal parts, sat about a hundred persons, all
devoutly listening to their minister, who stood before them on what
might he called a small, natural pulpit of living stone. Up to it there
led a short flight of steps, and over it waved the canopy of a tall,
graceful birch tree. The pulpit stood in the middle of the channel,
directly facing the congregation, and separated from them by the clear,
deep, sparkling pool, into which the scarce-heard water poured over the
blackened rock. The water, as it left the pool, separated into two
streams, and flowed on each side of that altar, thus placing it in an
island, whose large, mossy stones were richly embowered under the golden
blossoms and green tresses of the broom.</p>
<p>At the close of divine service, a row of maidens, all clothed in
purest white, came gliding off from the congregation, and, crossing the
murmuring stream on stepping stones, arranged themselves at the foot of
the pulpit with those who were about to be baptized. Their devout
fathers, just as though they had been in their own kirk, had been
sitting there during worship, and now stood up before the minister. The
baptismal water, taken from that pellucid pool, was lying, consecrated,
in an appropriate receptacle, formed by the upright stones that composed
one side of the pulpit, and the holy rite proceeded.</p>
<p>Some of the younger ones in that semicircle kept gazing down into the
pool, in which the whole scene was reflected; and now and then, in spite
of the grave looks and admonishing whispers of their elders, letting
fall a pebble into the water, that they might judge of its depth, from
the length of time that elapsed before the clear air bells lay sparkling
on the agitated surface. The rite was over, and the religious service of
the day closed by a psalm. The mighty rocks hemmed in the holy sound,
and sent it in a more compact volume, clear, sweet, and strong, up to
heaven. When the psalm ceased, an echo, like a spirit’s voice, was heard
dying away, high up among the magnificent architecture of the cliffs;
and once more might be noticed in the silence, the reviving voice of the
waterfall.</p>
<p>Just then, a large stone fell from the top of the cliff into the
pool, a loud voice was heard, and a plaid was hung over on the point of
a shepherd’s staff. Their wakeful sentinel had descried danger, and this
was his warning. Forthwith, the congregation rose. There were paths,
dangerous to unpracticed feet, along the ledges of the rocks, leading up
to several caves and places of concealment. The more active and young
assisted the elder, more especially the old pastor, and the women with
the infants; and many minutes had not elapsed, till not a living
creature was visible in the channel of the stream, but all of them were
hidden, or nearly so, in the clefts and caverns.</p>
<p>The shepherd who had given the alarm, had lain down again instantly
in his plaid on the greensward, upon the summit of these precipices. A
party of soldiers was immediately upon him, and demanded what signals he
had been making, and to whom; when one of them, looking over the edge of
the cliff, exclaimed, “See, see! Humphrey, We have caught the whole
tabernacle of the Lord in a net at last. There they are, praising God
among the stones of the river Mouse. These are the Cartland Craigs. A
noble cathedral!” “Fling the lying sentinel over the cliffs. Here is a
canting Covenanter for you, deceiving honest soldiers on the very
Sabbath day. Over with him, over with him; out of the gallery into the
pit.” But the shepherd had vanished like a shadow, and, mixing with the
tall, green broom and bushes, was making his unseen way toward a wood.
“Satan has saved his servant; but come, my lads, follow me. I know the
way down into the bed of the stream, and the steps up to Wallace’s Cave.
They are called, ‘kittle nine stanes;’ The hunt’s up. We’ll all be in at
the death. Halloo! my boys, halloo!”</p>
<p>The soldiers dashed down a less precipitous part of the wooded banks,
a little below the “craigs,” and hurried up the channel. But when they
reached the altar where the old, gray-haired minister had been seen
standing, and the rocks that had been covered with people, all was
silent and solitary; not a creature to be seen. “Here is a Bible,
dropped by some of them,” cried a soldier, and, with his foot, he spun
it away into the pool. “A bonnet, a bonnet,” cried another; “now for the
pretty, sanctified face, that rolled its demure eyes below it.” But
after a few jests and oaths, the soldiers stood still, eying with a kind
of mysterious dread the black and silent walls of the rocks that hemmed
them in, and hearing only the small voice of the stream that sent a
profounder stillness through the heart of that majestic solitude. “What
if these cowardly Covenanters should tumble down upon our heads pieces
of rock, from their hiding places! Advance, or retreat?”</p>
<p>There was no reply; for a slight fear was upon every man. Musket or
bayonet could be of little use to men obliged to clamber up rocks, along
slender paths, leading they know not where. And they were aware that
armed men nowadays worshiped God; men of iron hearts, who feared not the
glitter of the soldier’s arms, neither barrel nor bayonet; men of long
stride, firm step, and broad breast, who, on the open field, would have
overthrown the marshaled line, and gone first and foremost, if a city
had to be taken by storm.</p>
<p>As the soldiers were standing together irresolute, a noise came upon
their ears like distant thunder, but even more appalling; and a slight
current of air, as if propelled by it, passed whispering along the
sweetbriers, and the broom, and the tresses of the birch trees. It came
deepening, and rolling, and roaring on; and the very Cartland Craigs
shook to their foundation, as if in an earthquake. “The Lord have mercy
upon us! What is this?” And down fell many of the miserable wretches on
their knees, and some on their faces, upon the sharp-pointed rocks. Now,
it was like the sound of many myriads of chariots rolling on their iron
axles down the strong channel of the torrent. The old, gray-haired
minister issued from the mouth of Wallace’s Cave, and said, in a loud
voice, “The Lord God terrible reigneth!”</p>
<p>A waterspout had burst up among the moorlands, and the river, in its
power, was at hand. There it came, tumbling along into that long reach
of cliffs, and, in a moment, filled it with one mass of waves. Huge,
agitated clouds of foam rode on the surface of a blood-red torrent. An
army must have been swept off by that flood. The soldiers perished in a
moment; but high up in the cliffs, above the sweep of destruction, were
the Covenanters, men, women, and children, uttering prayers to God,
unheard by themselves, in the raging thunder.</p>

<p>在拉纳克教会，已经有好几个月没有举行洗礼了。如今宗教迫害已到了最猖獗的时候，那个教区里的居民找了其他地方礼拜上帝和举行宗教仪式。今天是安息日，大约有一百人聚集到了一起，这一小群人是为了做礼拜而来，他们举行仪式的地方比任何人类用双手为上帝建造的庙宇都要宏伟壮观。会众们并非在钟声缓缓敲响时集合，但每个人都晓得时间，也都按时前往。这是因为在群山、森林、旷野和田地之间有上百个日时计，无论在骄阳之下还是阴暗之中，牧羊人与农夫都能通过它们观测到准确的时间。</p>
<p>他们集会的“教堂”，是由上帝用手把亘古不变的巨石劈开而建。在几百英尺高的悬崖上，溪流沿着巨大的裂缝奔流；悬崖的一侧有些大石块，而另一侧则有些相应的凹口，仿佛这巨石是由于一场地震而裂开的。河床上布满了数不尽数的碎石和松散的大石，有些平滑而光秃秃的，有些在裂缝间可见泥土和绿色植物，上面还到处长着灌木和绿树。人们放眼望去，视野即刻变得狭窄，仿佛被这两边合拢的悬崖遮挡住了。这壮丽的河段有数不清的水潭、溪流和瀑布，当水位较低时——现在正值旱季，就是这种情况——即可轻易走到这样的景色里头，头顶高悬着静谧的蓝天，品味着这僻静之地全然的庄严。</p>
<p>那无法攀登的悬崖挂在半空之中，人们向上仰望，便被那高耸入云的气势所震慑。断壁极力向外延伸，在它的顶端与河床之间，总是有白嘴鸦和斑鸠在飞翔，不时还会出现一只老鹰，于是深谷中便回荡着狂野的呱呱声、低沉的啼鸣与尖利的喊叫。有时，一只苍鹭会出现在小小的石岛上，站得笔直，或是沿着悬崖裂缝那森黑的石壁，像一朵白云般腾空而去，倏忽不见。只有长翅膀的生灵才能居住在这一带。狐狸和野猫会选择没有那么险峻的栖息地。然而，那被迫害的基督徒与他们敬拜的上帝也来到了此地，上帝用手把那些巨大的石柱和拱门高悬在他们头顶，从坚固的巨石中挖出那些廊台，把他们的双脚置于宁静的潭水中，他们望向那透明的美景，看到自己的倒影围在一起端坐着，手里捧着《圣经》。</p>
<p>在这儿，在悬崖狭长的裂缝之上，呈半圆形突出的石壁上方流过一条小溪，溪水潺潺落下，成了低语的瀑布，把会众分成人数均等的两部分，这一百多个人全都正襟危坐，虔诚地聆听着牧师的布道；牧师就站在他们面前，他也许会把他站立的地方称为“用活石搭建的自然小讲坛”。这“讲坛”上面有一段短短的台阶，台阶上笼罩着浓密的树阴，一株高高的白桦树优雅挺立，迎风招展。讲坛就屹立在河床中央，正对会众，溪水从那森黑的巨石上无声地倾注入潭中，把人们一分为二的正是那清澈、幽深而泛着波光的潭水。潭水流到尽头便分成两条小溪，分别绕着圣坛的两边流动。圣坛放置在一个小岛上，小岛上有些长满青苔的大石，全都隐藏在金雀花那金色的花朵与绿色的灌木丛之中。</p>
<p>礼拜结束的时候，一列少女从会众中鱼贯而出，她们全都一身洁白，穿过潺潺的小溪，踏过一块块石头，来到讲台之下，与那些即将受洗的人们站在一起。她们那些虔敬的父亲仿佛仍然置身于教堂之中，在礼拜期间一直坐在那儿，现在全都在牧师面前站起身来。洗礼用的水取自那澄清的水潭，被视为圣洁无比，讲台一侧的几块立石就成了再合适不过的容器，圣水就盛在里面。神圣的仪式开始了。</p>
<p>潭水里倒映着一切，而站成半圆形的人们中有些年纪较轻的，就一直盯着水潭看。尽管年长的人们神情庄重，低声地劝诫着这些年轻人，但他们还是时不时地往水潭中掷个小石头，在清新的空气奏响乐音、平静的水面激起水花之前，从流逝的时间判断水潭有多深。仪式结束了，人们唱了一段圣诗，这一天的宗教仪式就结束了。神圣的声音环绕着巨石，在聚拢的悬崖中更为响亮，这清澈、甜美、嘹亮的声音直冲云霄。圣歌结束时，余音袅袅，如同精灵般的歌唱渐渐隐去，消失在巍峨的峭壁之间，在重归寂静之时，再次传入人们耳朵的，是那苏醒的瀑布淙淙的流水声。</p>
<p>就在这时，一块大石从悬崖之巅掉落水潭之中，人们听到一声巨响，一块方格披肩挂在了牧羊人的棍子顶端。他们警觉的哨兵发现了危险情况，这就是他发出的警报。会众们立即站了起来。沿着悬崖突出的地方有些小路，通往可以藏身的洞穴以及其他地方，但对于没有经验的人们来说，这么走是非常危险的。年轻而身体灵活的扶持着年长的，特别护卫着那位老牧师以及抱着婴儿的妇女；不一会儿，溪水边已经看不到一个人的身影，他们差不多全都躲藏到悬崖的缝隙或是洞穴之中了。</p>
<p>发出警报的牧羊人马上披上了他的方格披肩，又躺在了悬崖顶峰的草地上。一群士兵立刻逼近了他，盘问他发出的是什么信号，是向谁发出的。其中一个士兵细细查看着悬崖边，大声喊道：“看，看！汉弗莱，我们终于把整个教会的人一网打尽了。他们就在那边，在玛沃斯河上的那些石头之间赞美上帝呢。这儿都是悬崖峭壁。一座多宏伟的教堂啊！”“把那个撒谎的岗哨扔到悬崖下面去。你们伪善的盟约者，竟在安息日这一天欺骗城市的士兵。他要完蛋了，完蛋了，把他抬出通道扔到坑里。”然而牧羊人像影子一样消失了，他混在那一片高高的绿色——那金雀花与灌木丛之间，朝树林跑去。“撒旦已经挽救了他的仆从。但不要慌，我的伙伴们，跟着我走吧。我知道有条路通往河底，从那儿可以爬到华莱士的洞穴里去。人们管那儿叫作‘难对付的九块石头’。猎人来了。我们全部人都危在旦夕。嘿，我的孩子们，快走！”</p>
<p>沿着树木繁茂的河岸，士兵们从不太陡峭的地方猛冲下来，一来到悬崖底下，就向河道赶去。但当他们来到那头发花白的老牧师曾站立的圣坛上面，还有一块块原来站满了人的石头之上，现在是一片寂静荒凉，一个人影也不见。“这里有一本《圣经》，是他们的人遗落的。”一个士兵喊道，他抬起脚一踢，《圣经》就飞落到水潭里。“一顶圆帽，一顶圆帽，”另一个叫道：“是属于那张圣洁漂亮的脸蛋儿的，她曾在那帽子底下滚动着故作矜持的双眼呢。”然而在一阵嘲笑和咒骂过后，士兵们就呆立不动了，神色中流露出一种神秘的畏惧，双眼紧盯着四周那森黑而静默的石壁。在这壮美的荒僻之地中央，只听见小溪低低的流水声，给人一种更深远的荒寂之感。“要是这些胆小的盟约者从藏身之处朝我们脑袋扔石头，那可怎么办？是往前走，还是撤退？”</p>
<p>没有人回答，每个人心里都隐隐感到了恐惧。倘若他们被迫要沿着那些不知通往哪里的羊肠小道，攀上一块块岩石，步枪或是刺刀就派不上什么用场。他们也清楚，如今敬拜上帝的人也是携带武装的，这些具有钢铁意志的人们既不怕士兵手里闪亮的刺刀，亦不怕他们的枪管所喷出的火舌；他们迈开坚定的大步，挺着宽阔的胸膛，在开阔的战场能冲垮士兵排好的阵型，倘若要攻城拔寨，他们也必定冲在最前头。</p>
<p>正当士兵们站在那儿惊疑不定之时，他们的耳边传来一声闷响，仿佛是远处在打雷一般，但比雷声更令人心惊胆战。仿佛是在这声音的驱使之下，一股细微的气流低语着，漫过蔷薇、金雀花和白桦树的树枝。气流越来越强，咆哮着滚滚向前，这悬崖峭壁的底部都在摇晃，仿佛是地震了一般。“上帝饶恕我们吧！这是什么？”许多可怜的家伙倒下了，有的跪倒在尖利的石头上，有的径直趴在了上面。如今，这声音听起来仿佛是在那滚滚的洪流之下有无数辆战车正滚动着铁轴。那头发花白的老牧师走出华莱士的洞穴，嗓音洪亮地说：“圣主的威力无上！”</p>
<p>荒野间喷出一股水柱，汹涌的河水逼近了。它翻腾着，涌进了悬崖之间的狭长河段，顷刻间便卷起惊涛骇浪。在这血红色的洪水上面，激起了一团团巨大的白沫。即便是一支军队，无疑也会被这样的洪水一扫而光。士兵们顷刻间命丧黄泉；然而在那高高的悬崖上面，在这一片废墟之上，是那些盟约者——男人、女人和孩子，他们在震耳欲聋的雷声中向上帝祷告着，那祈祷声连他们自己也听不见。</p>

<p>OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH</p>
<p>守安息日</p>
<p>Gardiner Spring, 1785-1873, was the son of Samuel Spring, D.D., who
was pastor of a Congregational church in Newburyport, Massachusetts, for
more than forty years. The son entered Yale College, and was
valedictorian of his class in 1805. He studied law for a time; then went
to Bermuda, where he taught nearly two years. On his return he completed
his law studies, and practiced his profession for more than a year. In
1810, having studied theology at Andover, he was ordained as pastor of
the “Brick Church” in New York City. Here he remained till his death. He
was elected president of Dartmouth College, and also of Hamilton, but
declined both positions. His works, embracing about twenty octavo
volumes, have passed through several editions; some have been translated
into foreign languages, and reprinted in Europe. As a preacher,
Dr. Spring was eloquent and energetic.</p>
<p>The Sabbath lies at the foundation of all true morality. Morality
flows from principle. Let the principles of moral obligation become
relaxed, and the practice of morality will not long survive the
overthrow. No man can preserve his own morals, no parent can preserve
the morals of his children, without the impressions of religious
obligation.</p>
<p>If you can induce a community to doubt the genuineness and
authenticity of the Scriptures; to question the reality and obligations
of religion; to hesitate, undeciding, whether there be any such thing as
virtue or vice; whether there be an eternal state of retribution beyond
the grave; or whether there exists any such being as God, you have
broken down the barriers of moral virtue, and hoisted the flood gates of
immorality and crime. I need not say that when a people have once done
this, they can no longer exist as a tranquil and happy people. Every
bond that holds society together would be ruptured; fraud and treachery
would take the place of confidence between man and man; the tribunals of
justice would be scenes of bribery and injustice; avarice, perjury,
ambition, and revenge would walk through the land, and render it more
like the dwelling of savage beasts than the tranquil abode of civilized
and Christianized men.</p>
<p>If there is an institution which opposes itself to this progress of
human degeneracy, and throws a shield before the interests of moral
virtue in our thoughtless and wayward world, it is the Sabbath. In the
fearful struggle between virtue and vice, notwithstanding the powerful
auxiliaries which wickedness finds in the bosoms of men, and in the
seductions and influence of popular example, wherever the Sabbath has
been suffered to live, the trembling interests of moral virtue have
always been revered and sustained. One of the principal occupations of
this day is to illustrate and enforce the great principles of sound
morality. Where this sacred trust is preserved inviolate, you behold a
nation convened one day in seven for the purpose of acquainting
themselves with the best moral principles and precepts; and it can not
be otherwise than that the authority of moral virtue, under such
auspices, should be acknowledged and felt.</p>
<p>We may not, at once, perceive the effects which this weekly
observance produces. Like most moral causes, it operates slowly; but it
operates surely, and gradually weakens the power and breaks the yoke of
profligacy and sin. No villain regards the Sabbath. No vicious family
regards the Sabbath. No immoral community regards the Sabbath. The holy
rest of this ever-memorable day is a barrier which is always broken down
before men become giants in sin. Blackstone, in his Commentaries on the
Laws of England, remarks that “a corruption of morals usually follows a
profanation of the Sabbath.” It is an observation of Lord Chief Justice
Hale, that “of all the persons who were convicted of capital crimes,
while he was on the bench, he found a few only who would not confess
that they began their career of wickedness by a neglect of the duties of
the Sabbath and vicious conduct on that day.”</p>
<p>The prisons in our own land could probably tell us that they have
scarcely a solitary tenant who had not broken over the restraints of the
Sabbath before he was abandoned to crime. You may enact laws for the
suppression of immorality, but the secret and silent power of the
Sabbath constitutes a stronger shield to the vital interest of the
community than any code of penal statutes that ever was enacted. The
Sabbath is the keystone of the arch which sustains the temple of virtue,
which, however defaced, will survive many a rude shock so long as the
foundation remains firm.</p>
<p>The observance of the Sabbath is also most influential in securing
national prosperity. The God of Heaven has said, “Them that honor me I
will honor,” You will not often find a notorious Sabbath breaker a
permanently prosperous man; and a Sabbath-breaking community is never a
happy or prosperous community. There is a multitude of unobserved
influences which the Sabbath exerts upon the temporal welfare of men. It
promotes the spirit of good order and harmony; it elevates the poor from
want; it transforms squalid wretchedness; it imparts self-respect and
elevation of character; it promotes softness and civility of manners; it
brings together the rich and the poor upon one common level in the house
of prayer; it purifies and strengthens the social affections, and makes
the family circle the center of allurement and the source of
instruction, comfort, and happiness. Like its own divine religion, “it
has the promise of the life that now is and that which is to come,” for
men can not put themselves beyond the reach of hope and heaven so long
as they treasure up this one command, “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep
it holy.”</p>

<p>安息日构成了所有真正美德的基石。美德源于准则。倘若道德义务的准则有所松懈，那么所践行的道德规范不久就将土崩瓦解。假如缺乏对宗教义务的认识，那么将没有人能保持自己的美德，亦没有父母能让自己的儿女保持美德。</p>
<p>倘若你能引诱一个社区的人对《圣经》的真实性产生怀疑，对宗教的现实及义务产生疑问，对是否存在美德和恶行、对彼岸世界是否有永恒之报应、对是否存在上帝都迟疑不决，那么你就已破坏了道德的壁垒，为丑行与罪恶升起了闸门。毋庸置疑，要是一个人曾经做过这样的事，他的生活就再也无法安宁快乐了。每一条维系社会的纽带都会断裂，人与人之间的信任将被尔虞我诈、背信弃义所替代，正义的法庭成了见证行贿与不公的场所，贪婪、虚伪、野心勃勃和报仇雪恨的风气将在这片土地上盛行，让这片土地变得更像是野兽的繁衍之地，而非文明的基督徒安宁的聚居之处。</p>
<p>倘若有一种风俗能抵制人类的不断堕落，为我们这个缺乏思想、反复无常的世界在道德前面竖起一道盾牌，那就是安息日。在美德与丑行之间展开了一场空前激烈的斗争，尽管邪恶在人心之中发现了强大的同盟，在流行人物的诱惑和影响之中找到了得力助手，但只要能够在困难之中坚持安息日的风俗，那奄奄一息的道德真理终将复苏并继续维系。今日的一个主要任务，就是要阐明并实施健全的道德规范。要是这种神圣的信任能不受亵渎，继续保存下去，你就会发现这个国家的人民一周中有一日要召集起来，不断学习最好的道德规范与戒律；无疑，在安息日的守护之下，美德的威信将树立起来，为众人所感知。</p>
<p>这种每周守安息日的风俗所带来的影响，我们也许不能马上觉察。像绝大多数的道德大业一样，它进展缓慢，却是潜移默化的，能逐渐动摇罪恶的力量，打破恶行的枷锁。暴徒不会重视安息日。品行不端的家庭不会重视安息日。堕落的社区亦不会重视安息日。在这个永远值得铭记的日子中遵守圣洁的休息，本身就是一道屏障，打破屏障之人总是会落得罪孽深重的下场。布莱克斯东撰写了一些对英格兰法律的解释，其中提到“对安息日的亵渎通常伴随着道德的堕落”。英国首席大法官黑尔注意到，当他主持审判的时候，他发现所有被定下重罪的犯人，甚少有人拒绝承认他们罪恶生涯始于忽视了安息日的义务，并在那天干下了邪恶的勾当。</p>
<p>我国的监狱也许能向我们展示，他们那些单独囚禁的重犯，在彻底沦落为作恶多端之前并未打破安息日的种种限制，这种情况鲜为人见。你也许会制定法律去遏制不道德的行径，但安息日那神秘而无声的力量，比起任何曾经制定的刑法法典，都能更为有效地捍卫社会的根本利益。在支撑道德圣殿的拱门上，安息日就是拱心石，不管外表如何剥落毁损，只要根基牢固，就能经受得起一次又一次的猛烈撞击。</p>
<p>守安息日亦能发挥最积极的作用，确保国家蒸蒸日上。天国之父曾说：“给我荣耀的，我将酬之以荣。”一个不守安息日的声名狼藉之徒不太可能永远一帆风顺。而一个不守安息日的社会，永远不会是一个幸福而昌盛的社会。安息日对人的现世福祉所施加的影响，有许多是无法估量的。它促进良好秩序与和谐精神；它让陷于穷困之人受到鼓舞；它改变卑劣可耻之徒；它赋予人们自尊与个性的提升；它发扬人的温柔平和与文明举止；它让祷告之殿上的富人与穷人一律平等；它净化并加强了人与人之间的情感，让家庭成为最具吸引力的中心，成为指引、慰藉与幸福之源。一如它本身的神圣教义所言：“它让当下与即将到来的生活都充满了希望。”只要人们珍视这一条律令，就不会长久地远离希望与天堂——“谨记安息日，恪守它的神圣。”</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF COLUMBUS</p>
<p>哥伦布的性格</p>
<p>Washington Irving, 1783-1859. Among those whose works have enriched
American literature, and have given it a place in the estimation of
foreigners, no name stands higher than that of Washington Irving. He was
born in the city of New York; his father was a native of Scotland, and
his mother was English. He had an ordinary school education, and at the
age of sixteen began the study of law. Two of his older brothers were
interested in literary pursuits; and in his youth he studied the old
English authors. He was also passionately fond of books of travel. At
the age of nineteen, he began his literary career by writing for a paper
published by his brother. In 1804 be made a voyage to the south of
Europe. On his return he completed his studies in law, but never
practiced his profession. “Salmagundi,” his first book (partly written
by others), was published in 1807. This was followed, two years later,
by “Knickerbocker’s History of New York.” Soon after, he entered into
mercantile pursuits in company with two brothers. At the close at the
war with England he sailed again for Europe, and remained abroad
seventeen years. During his absence he formed the acquaintance of the
most eminent literary men of his time, and wrote several of his works;
among them were: “The Sketch Book,” “Bracebridge Hall,” “Tales of a
Traveler,” “Life and Voyages of Columbus,” and the “Conquest of
Granada.” On his return he made a journey west of the Mississippi, and
gathered materials for several other books. From 1842 to 1846 he was
Minister to Spain. On his return to America he established his residence
at “Sunnyside,” near Tarrytown, on the Hudson, where he passed the last
years of his life. A young lady to whom he was attached having died in
early life, Mr. Irving never married.</p>
<p>His works are marked by humor, just sentiment, and elegance and
correctness of expression. They were popular both at home and abroad
from the first, and their sale brought him a handsome fortune. The “Life
of Washington,” his last work, was completed in the same year in which
he died.</p>
<p>Columbus was a man of great and inventive genius. The operations of
his mind were energetic, but irregular; bursting forth, at times, with
that irresistible force which characterizes intellect of such an order.
His ambition was lofty and noble, inspiring him with high thoughts and
an anxiety to distinguish himself by great achievements. He aimed at
dignity and wealth in the same elevated spirit with which he sought
renown; they were to rise from the territories he should discover, and
be commensurate in importance.</p>
<p>His conduct was characterized by the grandeur of his views and the
magnanimity of his spirit. Instead of ravaging the newly-found
countries, like many of his cotemporary discoverers, who were intent
only on immediate gain, he regarded them with the eyes of a legislator;
he sought to colonize and cultivate them, to civilize the natives, to
build cities, introduce the useful arts, subject everything to the
control of law, order, and religion, and thus to found regular and
prosperous empires. That he failed in this was the fault of the
dissolute rabble which it was his misfortune to command, with whom all
law was tyranny and all order oppression.</p>
<p>He was naturally irascible and impetuous, and keenly sensible to
injury and injustice; yet the quickness of his temper was counteracted
by the generosity and benevolence of his heart. The magnanimity of his
nature shone forth through all the troubles of his stormy career. Though
continually outraged in his dignity, braved in his authority, foiled in
his plans, and endangered in his person by the seditions of turbulent
and worthless men, and that, too, at times when suffering under anguish
of body and anxiety of mind enough to exasperate the most patient, yet
he restrained his valiant and indignant spirit, and brought himself to
forbear, and reason, and even to supplicate. Nor can the reader of the
story of his eventful life fail to notice how free he was from all
feeling of revenge, how ready to forgive and forget on the least sign of
repentance and atonement. He has been exalted for his skill in
controlling others, but far greater praise is due to him for the
firmness he displayed in governing himself.</p>
<p>His piety was genuine and fervent. Religion mingled with the whole
course of his thoughts and actions, and shone forth in his most private
and unstudied writings. Whenever he made any great discovery he devoutly
returned thanks to God. The voice of prayer and the melody of praise
rose from his ships on discovering the new world, and his first action
on landing was to prostrate himself upon the earth and offer up
thanksgiving. All his great enterprises were undertaken in the name of
the Holy Trinity, and he partook of the holy sacrament previous to
embarkation. He observed the festivals of the church in the wildest
situations. The Sabbath was to him a day of sacred rest, on which he
would never sail from a port unless in case of extreme necessity. The
religion thus deeply seated in his soul diffused a sober dignity and a
benign composure over his whole deportment; his very language was pure
and guarded, and free from all gross or irreverent expressions.</p>
<p>A peculiar trait in his rich and varied character remains to be
noticed; namely, that ardent and enthusiastic imagination which threw a
magnificence over his whole course of thought. A poetical temperament is
discernible throughout all his writings and in all his actions. We see
it in all his descriptions of the beauties of the wild land he was
discovering, in the enthusiasm with which he extolled the blandness of
the temperature, the purity of the atmosphere, the fragrance of the air,
“full of dew and sweetness,” the verdure of the forests, the grandeur of
the mountains, and the crystal purity of the running streams. It spread
a glorious and golden world around him, and tinged everything with its
own gorgeous colors.</p>
<p>With all the visionary fervor of his imagination, its fondest dreams
fell short of the reality. He died in ignorance of the real grandeur of
his discovery. Until his last breath, he entertained the idea that he
had merely opened a new way to the old resorts of opulent commerce, and
had discovered some of the wild regions of the East. What visions of
glory would have broken upon his mind could he have known that he had
indeed discovered a new continent equal to the old world in magnitude,
and separated by two vast oceans from all the earth hitherto known by
civilized man! How would his magnanimous spirit have been consoled amid
the afflictions of age and the cares of penury, the neglect of a fickle
public and the injustice of an ungrateful king, could he have
anticipated the splendid empires which would arise in the beautiful
world he had discovered, and the nations, and tongues, and languages
which were to fill its land with his renown, and to revere and bless his
name to the latest posterity!</p>

<p>哥伦布是位极富创意的奇才。他的思维跳跃不定，突如其来的奇思妙想总是不可抑制地喷涌而出。他雄心勃勃，心怀远大，迫不及待地想建功立业以求出人头地。他渴望显赫的地位与无尽的财富，就如同渴望扬名一般迫切；而那片他将要发现的大陆会让他得偿所愿，因为这一发现的历史重要性足以让他名垂千古。</p>
<p>他的行为处事无不体现着他卓尔不凡的见地与海纳百川的胸怀。同时代的航海家只顾及眼前之利，一旦发现了处女地，便大肆破坏、掠夺。哥伦布却带着创建者的眼光，力图将其开拓为殖民地，在那里耕种开垦，教化原住民，建造城市，引入实用的工艺，将所有一切纳入法律、秩序与宗教的正轨，由此创建秩序井然、繁荣昌盛的国家。不幸的是，他面对的是一群目无法纪的暴民，在他们看来法律即是暴政，秩序等同于镇压，所以哥伦布的努力注定只能付之东流了。</p>
<p>哥伦布生性冲动易怒，对于来自别人的伤害和加诸在自己身上的不公尤为敏感，可是他性格中的仁厚却总能有效地驾驭这匹暴躁鲁莽的野马。这宽怀有容的天性犹如一座温暖的灯塔照亮了哥伦布充满狂风暴雨的生涯。即便身边总是不断有奸佞小人无端地践踏他的尊严，藐视他的专长，破坏他的计划，甚至威胁他的人身安全，即便肉身的苦痛和精神的焦虑能让最温文尔雅的绅士暴跳如雷，哥伦布却将生性中英勇好斗、疾恶如仇的一面苦苦压下，以坚忍和理性取而代之，甚至不惜以哀告恳求来博取众人对其伟大理想的理解。读完哥伦布跌宕一生的读者必然会折服于他的宽容大度，哪怕对方只要有一丝悔改之心，他便即刻不计前嫌，化敌为友。一直以来，哥伦布总以其善于治人而广为称道，但更应大书特书的却是他无与伦比的自制力。</p>
<p>他对宗教的信仰纯粹而炽热。宗教思想不仅渗透在他的所思所想、一言一行里，也闪耀在他私人书笺的字里行间。探险旅程中但凡有重大发现，他都会虔诚地将之归功于主的恩赐。每次发现新大陆，他的船队都会响起一片祈祷与礼赞之声，而他踏上陆地的第一件事就是深深地跪倒在地，直抒感恩之情。他所有的航海探险都是在圣父、圣子、圣灵的名义下进行，而每次起航前，他都会亲自参加圣礼。即便身处蛮荒之地，他也不会错过任何一次宗教节日。他严守安息日，除非万不得已，否则绝不会在那一天驾船离港。植根于他灵魂深处的宗教信仰，让他的言行举止间尽显持重高贵，温厚沉稳；他谈吐优雅，言辞谨慎，丝毫不沾市井之徒的浅陋粗鄙。</p>
<p>在哥伦布丰富多元的性格中，有一点极为与众不同，格外引人注目，那就是为其思想历程披上华彩、热情奔放的想象力。哥伦布的诗人气质也流露在他的书信笔记和举手投足中。他用激情澎湃的笔触描画着处女地的美丽动人，他歌颂那儿温和的气候，淳朴的环境，芬芳的空气，“所到之处露珠微颤，暗香浮动”；他赞美青翠的森林，壮丽的群山，还有如同水晶般清透晶莹的潺潺溪流。他的诗情画意把自己带到了一个美不胜收的世界，将那儿的一草一木都晕染上一抹独特而华美的色彩。</p>
<p>哥伦布的想象力犹如一双带着梦幻色彩的羽翼，然后这双不羁的翅膀最终没能飞抵现实的彼岸。哥伦布生前并不知道新大陆的发现究竟意味着什么。直至临终，他一直以为自己无非是为丰富的物资开辟了一条新的贸易航道，在遥远的东方发现了尚无人踏足的蛮荒之地。如果他知道他所发现的土地的面积之大比起欧亚非大陆（该处指15世纪的世界版图）毫不逊色，并由两大洋将其与迄今人类所知的其他陆地分割开来，哥伦布该会感到多么的荣耀自豪！如果他能预见到在这片广袤美丽的大地上有朝一日将建立起辉煌灿烂的帝国文明，而他的雄才大略将被这片土地上不同国家、民族、语言传至每个角落，他的名字将被生活在这里的人民世代传诵，那么他那颗备受贫困折磨、看尽世态炎凉、饱受寡恩君主苛待的宽厚之心，必定会倍感安慰。</p>

<p>“HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP”</p>
<p>“耶和华让他的所爱安然入睡”</p>
<p>Elizabeth Barrett Browning, 1809-1861, was born in London, married
the poet Robert Browning in 1846, and afterwards resided in Italy most
of the time till her death, which occurred at Florence. She was
thoroughly educated in severe and masculine studies, and began to write
at a very early age. Her “Essay on Mind,” a metaphysical and reflective
poem, was written at the age of sixteen. She wrote very rapidly, and her
friend, Miss Mitford, tells us that “Lady Geraldine’s Courtship,”
containing ninety-three stanzas, was composed in twelve hours! She
published several other long poems, “Aurora Leigh” being one of the most
highly finished. Mrs. Browning is regarded as one of the most able
female poets of modern times; but her writings are often obscure, and
some have doubted whether she always clearly conceived what she meant to
express. She had a warm sympathy with all forms of suffering and
distress. “He Giveth his Beloved Sleep” is one of the most beautiful of
her minor poems. The thought is an amplification of verse 2d of Psalm
cxxvii.</p>
<p>Of all the thoughts of God that are</p>
<p>Borne inward unto souls afar,</p>
<p>Along the Psalmist’s music deep,</p>
<p>Now tell me if that any is,</p>
<p>For gift or grace, surpassing this,—</p>
<p>“He giveth his beloved, sleep!”</p>
<p>What would we give to our beloved?</p>
<p>The hero’s heart to be unmoved,</p>
<p>The poet’s star-tuned harp, to sweep,</p>
<p>The patriot’s voice, to teach and rouse,</p>
<p>The monarch’s crown, to light the brows?—</p>
<p>“He giveth his beloved, sleep.”</p>
<p>What do we give to our beloved?</p>
<p>A little faith all undisproved,</p>
<p>A little dust to overweep,</p>
<p>And bitter memories to make</p>
<p>The whole earth blasted for our sake,—</p>
<p>“He giveth his beloved, sleep.”</p>
<p>“Sleep soft, beloved!” we sometimes say,</p>
<p>But have no tune to charm away</p>
<p>Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep.</p>
<p>But never doleful dream again</p>
<p>Shall break his happy slumber when</p>
<p>“He giveth his beloved, sleep.”</p>
<p>O earth, so full of dreary noises!</p>
<p>O men, with wailing in your voices!</p>
<p>O delve’d gold, the wailers heap!</p>
<p>O strife, O curse, that o’er it fall!</p>
<p>God strikes a silence through you all,</p>
<p>And “giveth his beloved, sleep.”</p>
<p>His dews drop mutely on the hill;</p>
<p>His cloud above it saileth still,</p>
<p>Though on its slope men sow and reap.</p>
<p>More softly than the dew is shed,</p>
<p>Or cloud is floated overhead,</p>
<p>“He giveth his beloved, sleep.”</p>
<p>Ay, men may wonder while they scan</p>
<p>A living, thinking, feeing man,</p>
<p>Confirmed in such a rest to keep;</p>
<p>But angels say—and through the word</p>
<p>I think their happy smile is heard—</p>
<p>“He giveth his beloved, sleep.”</p>
<p>For me my heart, that erst did go</p>
<p>Most like a tired child at a show,</p>
<p>That sees through tears the mummers leap,</p>
<p>Would now its wearied vision close,</p>
<p>Would childlike on his love repose</p>
<p>Who “giveth his beloved, sleep.”</p>
<p>And friends, dear friends,—when it shall be</p>
<p>That this low breath is gone from me,</p>
<p>And round my bier ye come to weep,</p>
<p>Let one most loving of you all</p>
<p>Say, “Not a tear must o’er her fall;</p>
<p>‘He giveth his beloved, sleep.’”</p>

<p>如今教人厌烦的戏码即将落幕，</p>
<p>天真无邪的情怀一去不回，</p>

<p>朋友，我亲爱的朋友们，</p>
<p>当游丝般的呼吸弃我而去，</p>
<p>当你们环绕棺椁前来哭灵，</p>
<p>就让那深情的话语在耳边响起，</p>
<p>“别为她的离去落泪心碎；</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF A SIEGE</p>
<p>围攻详述</p>
<p>“The skirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although only a few
are advanced from its dark shadow.” “Under what banner?” asked Ivanhoe.
“Under no ensign which I can observe,” answered Rebecca. “A singular
novelty,” muttered the knight, “to advance to storm such a castle
without pennon or banner displayed. Seest thou who they be that act as
leaders?” “A knight clad in sable armor is the most conspicuous,” said
the Jewess: “he alone is armed from head to heel, and seems to assume
the direction of all around him.”</p>
<p>“Seem there no other leaders?” exclaimed the anxious inquirer. “None
of mark and distinction that I can behold from this station,” said
Rebecca, “but doubtless the other side of the castle is also assailed.
They seem, even now, preparing to advance. God of Zion protect us! What
a dreadful sight! Those who advance first bear huge shields and defenses
made of plank: the others follow, bending their bows as they come on.
They raise their bows! God of Moses, forgive the creatures thou hast
made!”</p>
<p>Her description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for
assault, which was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at once
answered by a flourish of the Norman trumpets from the battlements,
which, mingled with the deep and hollow clang of the kettledrums,
retorted in notes of defiance the challenge of the enemy. The shouts of
both parties augmented the fearful din, the assailants crying, “Saint
George, for merry England!” and the Normans answering them with loud
cries of “Onward, De Bracy! Front de Boeuf, to the rescue!”</p>
<p>“And I must lie here like a bedridden monk,” exclaimed Ivanhoe,
“while the game that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand
of others! Look from the window once again, kind maiden, and tell me if
they yet advance to the storm.” With patient courage, strengthened by
the interval which she had employed in mental devotion, Rebecca again
took post at the lattice, sheltering herself, however, so as not to be
exposed to the arrows of the archers. “What dost thou see, Rebecca?”
again demanded the wounded knight. “Nothing but the cloud of arrows
flying so thick as to dazzle mine eyes, and to hide the bowmen who shoot
them.” “That can not endure,” said Ivanhoe. “If they press not right on,
to carry the castle by force of arms, the archery may avail but little
against stone walls and bulwarks. Look for the knight in dark armor,
fair Rebecca, and see how he bears himself; for as the leader is, so
will his followers be.”</p>
<p>“I see him not,” said Rebecca. “Foul craven!” exclaimed Ivanhoe;
“does he blench from the helm when the wind blows highest?” “He blenches
not! he blenches not!” said Rebecca; “I see him now: he leads a body of
men close under the outer barrier of the barbacan. They pull down the
piles and palisades; they hew down the barriers with axes. His high
black plume floats abroad over the throng like a raven over the field of
the slain. They have made a breach in the barriers, they rush in, they
are thrust back! Front de Boeuf heads the defenders. I see his gigantic
form above the press. They throng again to the breach, and the pass is
disputed, hand to hand, and man to man. God of Jacob! it is the meeting
of two fierce tides, the conflict of two oceans moved by adverse winds;”
and she turned her head from the window as if unable longer to endure a
sight so terrible.</p>
<p>Speedily recovering her self-control, Rebecca again looked forth, and
almost immediately exclaimed, “Holy prophets of the law! Front de Boeuf
and the Black Knight fight hand to hand on the breach, amid the roar of
their followers, who watch the progress of the strife. Heaven strike
with the cause of the oppressed and of the captive!” She then uttered a
loud shriek, and exclaimed, “He is down! he is down!” “Who is down!”
cried Ivanhoe; “for our dear Lady’s sake, tell me which has fallen!”
“The Black Knight,” answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again
shouted with joyful eagerness—“But no! but no! the name of the Lord of
Hosts be blessed! he is on foot again, and fights as if there were
twenty men’s strength in his single arm—his sword is broken—he snatches
an ax from a yeoman—he presses Front de Boeuf, blow on blow—the giant
stoops and totters like an oak under the steel of the woodman—he
falls-he falls!” “Front de Boeuf?” exclaimed Ivanhoe. “Front de Boeuf,”
answered the Jewess; “his men rush to the rescue, headed by the haughty
Templar, —their united force compels the champion to pause—they drag
Front de Boeuf within the walls.”</p>
<p>“The assailants have won the barriers, have they not?” said Ivanhoe.
“They have—they have—and they press the besieged hard upon the outer
wall; some plant ladders, some swarm like bees, and endeavor to ascend
upon the shoulders of each other; down go stones, beams, and trunks of
trees upon their heads, and as fast as they bear the wounded to the
rear, fresh men supply their places in the assault. Great God! hast thou
given men thine own image that it should be thus cruelly defaced by the
hands of their brethren!” “Think not of that,” replied Ivanhoe; “this is
no time for such thoughts. Who yield? Who push their way?”</p>
<p>“The ladders are thrown down,” replied Rebecca, shuddering; “the
soldiers lie groveling under them like crushed reptiles; the besieged
have the better.” “Saint George strike for us!” said the knight; “do the
false yeomen give way?” “No,” exclaimed Rebecca, “they bear themselves
right yeomanly; the Black Knight approaches the postern with his huge
ax; the thundering blows which he deals, you may hear them above all the
din and shouts of the battle; stones and beams are hailed down on the
brave champion; he regards them no more than if they were thistle down
and feathers.”</p>
<p>“Saint John of Acre!” said Ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on his
couch, “methought there was but one man in England that might do such a
deed.” “The postern gate shakes,” continued Rebecca; “it crashes—it is
splintered by his powerful blows—they rush in—the outwork is won! O God!
they hurry the defenders from the battlements—they throw them into the
moat! O men, if ye be indeed men, spare them that can resist no longer!”
“The bridge—the bridge which communicates with the castle—have they won
that pass?” exclaimed Ivanhoe. “No,” replied Rebecca; “the Templar has
destroyed the plank on which they crossed—few of the defenders escaped
with him into the castle—the shrieks and cries which you hear, tell the
fate of the others. Alas! I see that it is still more difficult to look
upon victory than upon battle.”</p>
<p>“What do they now, maiden?” said Ivanhoe; “look forth yet again—this
is no time to faint at bloodshed.” “It is over, for a time,” said
Rebecca; “our friends strengthen themselves within the outwork which
they have mastered.” “Our friends,” said Ivanhoe, “will surely not
abandon an enterprise so gloriously begun, and so happily attained; Oh
no! I will put my faith in the good knight whose ax has rent heart of
oak and bars of iron. Singular,” he again muttered to himself, “if there
can be two who are capable of such achievements. It is,—it must be
Richard Coeur de Lion.”</p>
<p>“Seest thou nothing else. Rebecca, by which the Black Knight may be
distinguished?” “Nothing,” said the Jewess, “all about him is as black
as the wing of the night raven. Nothing can I spy that can mark him
further; but having once seen him put forth his strength in battle,
methinks I could know him again among a thousand warriors. He rushes to
the fray as if he were summoned to a banquet. There is more than mere
strength; it seems as if the whole soul and spirit of the champion were
given to every blow which he deals upon his enemies. God forgive him the
sin of bloodshed! it is fearful, yet magnificent, to behold how the arm
and heart of one man can triumph over hundreds.”</p>

<p>“树林边上像是安插了一队弓箭手，不过只有少数几个暴露在树阴外面。”“他们打着什么旗号？”艾凡赫问。“我看不到旗号。”丽贝卡回答。“这倒奇怪，”骑士嘟囔着，“突袭城堡却不亮出番号或军旗。你能看出谁是这次行动的首领吗？”“一个身披黑色盔甲的骑士看上去最显眼，”犹太姑娘说，“只有他全副武装，身边的人好像都按他的指令前进。”</p>
<p>“没有其他首领了吗？”焦急的艾凡赫喊了一声。“从我这个位置看不到身上有特殊标记的人，”丽贝卡说，“不过有一点可以肯定，城堡的另一侧也受到了袭击。他们似乎现在就要准备发起进攻了。至高无上的天主啊！这是多么恐怖的画面！冲在最前面的那几个，有的手持盾牌，有的举着厚木板作掩护；后面的人都挽着弓步步跟进。他们要放箭了！摩西神啊！请你宽恕你的子民吧！”</p>
<p>一阵尖锐的军号声划破夜空，骤然打断了她的描述，几乎与此同时，城垛后面也响起了一连串伴着低沉鼓点的诺曼小号声，面对敌军的挑衅毫不示弱。双方军队齐齐高声呐喊，与鼓声号声交织成一片，响彻云霄，进攻的一方叫道，“圣乔治万岁，保佑英格兰！”而日耳曼人扯着喉咙回应道：“冲啊，德布拉西！弗朗·德·别夫，快来增援！”</p>
<p>“我竟然只能像一个不能动弹的修道士，躺在这里干瞪眼，”艾凡赫哀叫着，“外面正在进行一场决定我生死存亡的战斗，可现在只好眼睁睁地看着别人替我拼命了！再看一下窗户外面，好姑娘，看看他们是不是就要发动猛攻了。”丽贝卡定定神，这短暂的休整让她变得更加坚忍顽强，她再次勇敢地回到格子窗边，找了个藏身的位置，以防被弓箭手的弓箭射成马蜂窝。“你看到了什么，丽贝卡？”受伤的骑士又问道。“密密麻麻的弓箭像乌云一般席卷而来，我眼都看花了，除了弓箭我连弓箭手都看不到。”“这样下去可不行，”艾凡赫说，“如果他们不抓紧时间挺进，集中武力拿下城堡，单靠射箭是对付不了石墙和壁垒的。留意一下那个穿着黑色盔甲的骑士，美人丽贝卡，看看他的表现如何；因为将领怎么做，他的手下也会跟着效仿。”</p>
<p>“我看不到。”丽贝卡说。“该死的胆小鬼！”艾凡赫叫道，“难道就在风高浪急的时候，舵手要弃船而逃吗？”“他没有！他没有临阵脱逃！”丽贝卡说，“我看见他了：他率领着一支小分队逼近了碉堡外面的木栅。他们砍倒了桩柱和栅栏；接着用斧子劈开了篱墙。他头上的黑色羽翎在人群中迎风招展，肆意飘扬，像是盘旋在死人堆上空的乌鸦。他们已经在篱墙上打开了缺口，他们冲了进去，又被逼退回来！是弗朗·德·别夫和他率领的守卫军。人群中我一眼就能看到他巨大的身形。进攻的一方又一拥而上，在刚才那个缺口处展开了肉搏战，双方僵持不下。雅阁神啊！这简直就是两股惊涛骇浪在逆风之下的海域里扭打搏击啊！”她从窗边转开脸，仿佛眼前的一幕让她不忍再看下去。</p>
<p>很快她平复了心绪，再度转向窗口眺望，旋即她惊叫起来，“圣主先知啊！弗朗·德·别夫和黑衣骑士在缺口处一对一交上手了，双方的部下一边观战，一边高声呐喊，以壮声势。愿上帝保佑那些挨打被俘的人们。”突然，她又尖声叫起来，“他倒下了！他倒下了！”“谁倒下了！”艾凡赫也跟着喊，“看在圣母的份上，快告诉我哪一方被打倒了！”“是黑衣骑士，”丽贝卡低声回答，声音细小得几乎让人听不清她在说什么；可不一会儿她又欢呼起来——“哦，不！他没有被打垮！荣光归于圣主！他又站起来了，看他多么勇猛，二十个好汉都抵不过他一条臂膀——手中的剑断了，他从边上夺过一把斧子——一斧接着一斧，把弗朗·德·别夫逼得节节败退——巨人被打得弯下了腰，脚步踉跄，就像是樵夫砍刀下摇摇欲坠的橡树——他倒下去了，他摔倒了！”“是弗朗·德·别夫？”艾凡赫叫着。“就是弗朗·德·别夫，”犹太姑娘回答，“他的部下立即扑上去救援，领头的是桀骜不驯的圣殿骑士——他们人多势众，英勇的骑士被迫罢手——他们救下了弗朗·德·别夫，把他抬回城堡了。”</p>
<p>“进攻的一方已经拿下了外围的栅栏了，是不是？”艾凡赫说。“是的——是的——他们已经兵临城下了；有的人在架梯子，其他的一个踩着另一个的肩膀拼命地往上攀爬；石头、木板、树杆纷纷朝他们的脑袋砸下来，一旦有人受伤，立即被抬到后方，候补人员火速上前填补他们的空缺。伟大的上帝！您按自己的容貌创造了人类，难道就是为了让他们手足相残吗！”“快别多想了，”艾凡赫应道，“现在可没工夫想那些事儿。谁投降了？谁举兵压上了？”</p>
<p>“梯子都被扳倒了，”丽贝卡浑身战栗地回答，“士兵们压在梯子底下，像被压扁的虫子一样徒劳挣扎；守城的一方略占上风。”“圣乔治，请助我们一臂之力！”骑士说，“那些临时组织起来的农民义勇军们就这么认输了？”“没有，”丽贝卡大声回答，“他们就像他们的名号一样英勇无畏；黑衣骑士提着一柄巨斧冲到边门；有没有听到那雷鸣般的砍剁声，盖过了战场上所有的叫嚣喊杀；石头和木板像冰雹一样砸在勇士身上；可他一点都不在乎，就像是轻飘飘的山蓟和羽毛吹落在身上。”</p>
<p>“凭着阿克尔的圣约翰起誓！”艾凡赫喊道，兴奋地从床上撑直了身子，“我想在英国除了一个人再也没有谁能这样勇猛无敌。”“边门在摇晃，”丽贝卡接着说，“边门裂开了——他把它劈成了碎片——他们冲进去了——碉堡被攻破了！哦，上帝！他们把城垛上的护卫军从城墙上扔进了护城河！哦，天哪，你们要是真正的男子汉，就放过那些无力抵抗的人吧！”“桥——通往城堡的桥——被他们攻陷了吗？”艾凡赫高声问。“没有，”丽贝卡回答说，“圣殿骑士撤回城堡时就把桥上的木板给毁了——随他一起逃进城堡的护卫军寥寥无几——听那惨叫和哭喊声，你就知道其他人的结局了。啊呀！我现在才知道比起战争，胜利更加惨不忍睹。”</p>
<p>“眼下他们在干什么，姑娘？”艾凡赫说，“再朝外面看一下——现在可不是见血就晕的时候。”“结束了，暂时结束了，”丽贝卡说，“我们的朋友占领了碉堡，正在那里秣马厉兵。”“首战告捷，”艾凡赫说，“赢得又是如此大快人心，我们的朋友不会在这个时候半途而废的；绝对不会！我的信心全部押在那位了不起的骑士身上，他手上的斧子能砍断最坚固的铁条，能劈裂最狠毒的心肠。天下无人能及，”他又开始自言自语了，“如果这世上还有哪个能像他一样所向披靡的话——那他，一定就是‘狮心王’理查。”</p>
<p>“丽贝卡，看看还有什么显眼的标识能看出黑衣骑士到底是什么来路吗？”“没有了，”犹太姑娘说，“他浑身上下黑得如同飞行于夜间的乌鸦。除此之外，我找不出其他任何线索；不过只要看过适才他英勇杀敌的样子，下一次要是再遇见，哪怕是千军万马中我也一定能把他给找出来。他冲锋陷阵的时候就如同欣然赴宴一般。他靠得可不光是一身蛮力；他出手杀敌时的每招每式似乎都凝聚了勇士的精神与意志。愿上帝宽恕这血流成河的罪孽吧！亲眼目睹他是如何以一当百、以少胜多，真是令人胆寒，可是也的确又让人钦佩得五体投地。”</p>

<p>MARCO BOZZARIS</p>
<p>马尔科·博萨里斯</p>
<p>Fitz-Greene Halleck, 1790—1867, was born in Guilford, Connecticut. At
the age of eighteen he entered a banking house in New York, where he
remained a long time. For many years he was bookkeeper and assistant in
business for John Jacob Astor. Nearly all his poems were written before
he was forty years old, several of them in connection with his friend
Joseph Rodman Drake. His “Young America,” however, was written but a few
years before his death. Mr. Halleck’s poetry is carefully finished and
musical; much of it is sportive, and some satirical. No one of his poems
is better known than “Marco Bozzaris.”</p>
<p>At midnight, in his guarded tent,</p>
<p>The Turk was dreaming of the hour</p>
<p>When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,</p>
<p>Should tremble at his power.</p>
<p>In dreams, through camp and court he bore</p>
<p>The trophies of a conqueror;</p>
<p>In dreams, his song of triumph heard;</p>
<p>Then wore his monarch’s signet ring;</p>
<p>Then pressed that monarch’s throne—a king:</p>
<p>As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,</p>
<p>As Eden’s garden bird.</p>
<p>At midnight, in the forest shades,</p>
<p>Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band,</p>
<p>True as the steel of their tried blades,</p>
<p>Heroes in heart and hand.</p>
<p>There had the Persian’s thousands stood,</p>
<p>There had the glad earth drunk their blood,</p>
<p>On old Plataea’s day:</p>
<p>And now there breathed that haunted air,</p>
<p>The sons of sires who conquered there,</p>
<p>With arms to strike, and soul to dare,</p>
<p>As quick, as far as they.</p>
<p>An hour passed on—the Turk awoke;</p>
<p>That bright dream was his last:</p>
<p>He woke—to hear his sentries shriek,</p>
<p>“To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!”</p>
<p>He woke—to die mid flame and smoke,</p>
<p>And shout, and groan, and saber stroke,</p>
<p>And death shots falling thick and fast</p>
<p>As lightnings from the mountain cloud;</p>
<p>And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,</p>
<p>Bozzaris cheer his band:</p>
<p>“Strike—till the last armed foe expires;</p>
<p>Strike—for your altars and your fires;</p>
<p>Strike—for the green graves of your sires;</p>
<p>God—and your native land!”</p>
<p>They fought—like brave men, long and well;</p>
<p>They piled that ground with Moslem slain;</p>
<p>They conquered—but Bozzaris fell,</p>
<p>Bleeding at every vein.</p>
<p>His few surviving comrades saw</p>
<p>His smile, when rang their proud hurrah,</p>
<p>And the red field was won:</p>
<p>Then saw in death his eyelids close</p>
<p>Calmly, as to a night’s repose,</p>
<p>Like flowers at set of sun.</p>
<p>Come to the bridal chamber, Death!</p>
<p>Come to the mother, when she feels</p>
<p>For the first time her firstborn’s breath;</p>
<p>Come when the blessed seals</p>
<p>That close the pestilence are broke,</p>
<p>And crowded cities wail its stroke;</p>
<p>Come in consumption’s ghastly form,</p>
<p>The earthquake’s shock, the ocean storm;</p>
<p>Come when the heart beats high and warm</p>
<p>With banquet song, and dance, and wine:</p>
<p>And thou art terrible—the tear,</p>
<p>The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,</p>
<p>And all we know, or dream, or fear</p>
<p>Of agony, are thine.</p>
<p>But to the hero, when his sword</p>
<p>Has won the battle for the free,</p>
<p>Thy voice sounds like a prophet’s word;</p>
<p>And in its hollow tones are heard</p>
<p>The thanks of millions yet to be.</p>
<p>Bozzaris! with the storied brave</p>
<p>Greece nurtured in her glory’s time,</p>
<p>Rest thee—there is no prouder grave</p>
<p>Even in her own proud clime.</p>
<p>We tell thy doom without a sigh,</p>
<p>For thou art Freedom’s, now, and Fame’s.</p>
<p>One of the few, the immortal names,</p>
<p>That were not born to die.</p>

<p>呻吟，丧钟，墓布，棺椁</p>
<p>我们所知、所梦、所惧的</p>
<p>一切痛苦，皆来自于你。</p>
<p>然而对于英雄而言，当他的利剑</p>
<p>打赢了自由的战役，</p>

<p>博萨里斯！希腊的光辉岁月</p>
<p>孕育了你身上传扬千古的浩然正气，</p>
<p>你安息吧——即使在这骄傲的土地</p>
<p>也找不到更为骄傲的墓地。</p>
<p>我们谈起你的离去，无人叹息，</p>
<p>因为你属于自由，属于荣誉。</p>
<p>永垂不朽的人物寥寥无几，</p>
<p>而你的名字位列其一。</p>

<p>SONG OF THE GREEK BARD</p>
<p>希腊游吟诗人之歌</p>
<p>George Gordon Byron, Lord Byron, 1788-1824. This gifted poet was the
son of a profligate father and of a fickle and passionate mother. He was
afflicted with lameness from his birth; and, although he succeeded to
his great-uncle’s title at ten years of age, he inherited financial
embarrassment with it. These may be some of the reasons for the morbid
and wayward character of the youthful genius. It is certain that he was
not lacking in affection, nor in generosity. In his college days, at
Cambridge, he was willful and careless of his studies. “Hours of
Idleness,” his first book, appeared in 1807. It was severely treated by
the “Edinburgh Review,” which called forth his “English Bards and Scotch
Reviewers,” in 1809. Soon after, he went abroad for two years; and, on
his return, published the first two cantos of “Childe Harold’s
Pligrimage,” a work that made him suddenly famous. He married in 1815,
but separated from his wife after one year. Soured and bitter, he now
left England, purposing never to return. He spent most of the next seven
years in Italy, where most of his poems were written. The last year of
his life was spent in Greece, aiding in her struggle for liberty against
the Turks. He died at Missolonghi. As a man, Byron was impetuous, morbid
and passionate. He was undoubtedly dissipated and immoral, but perhaps
to a less degree than has sometimes been asserted. As a poet, he
possessed noble powers, and he has written much that will last; in
general, however, his poetry is not wholesome, and his fame is less than
it once was.</p>
<p>The isles of Greece! the isles of Greece!</p>
<p>Where burning Sappho loved and sung,</p>
<p>Where grew the arts of war and peace, —</p>
<p>Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!</p>
<p>Eternal summer gilds them yet,</p>
<p>But all, except their sun, is set.</p>
<p>The Scian and the Teian muse,</p>
<p>The hero’s harp, the lover’s lute,</p>
<p>Have found the fame your shores refuse;</p>
<p>Their place of birth alone is mute</p>
<p>To sounds which echo further west</p>
<p>Than your sires’ “Islands of the Blest.”</p>
<p>The mountains look on Marathon,</p>
<p>And Marathon looks on the sea;</p>
<p>And musing there an hour alone,</p>
<p>I dreamed that Greece might still be free;</p>
<p>For, standing on the Persian’s grave,</p>
<p>I could not deem myself a slave.</p>
<p>A king sat on the rocky brow</p>
<p>Which looks o’er sea-born Salamis;</p>
<p>And ships, by thousands, lay below,</p>
<p>And men in nations,—all were his!</p>
<p>He counted them at break of day,—</p>
<p>And when the sun set, where were they?</p>
<p>And where are they? And where art thou,</p>
<p>My country? On thy voiceless shore</p>
<p>The heroic lay is tuneless now,—</p>
<p>The heroic bosom beats no more!</p>
<p>And must thy lyre, so long divine,</p>
<p>Degenerate into hands like mine?</p>
<p>Must we but weep o’er days more blest?</p>
<p>Must we but blush? Our fathers bled.</p>
<p>Earth! render back from out thy breast</p>
<p>A remnant of our Spartan dead!</p>
<p>Of the three hundred, grant but three,</p>
<p>To make a new Thermopylae!</p>
<p>What! silent still and silent all?</p>
<p>Ah! no; —the voices of the dead</p>
<p>Sound like a distant torrent’s fall,</p>
<p>And answer, “Let one living head,</p>
<p>But one, arise, —we come, we come!”</p>
<p>’T is but the living who are dumb!</p>
<p>In vain—in vain!—strike other chords;</p>
<p>Fill high the cup with Samian wine!</p>
<p>Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,</p>
<p>And shed the blood of Scio’s vine!</p>
<p>Hark! rising to the ignoble call,</p>
<p>How answers each bold Bacchanal!</p>
<p>You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet;</p>
<p>Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?</p>
<p>Of two such lessons, why forget</p>
<p>The nobler and the manlier one?</p>
<p>You have the letters Cadmus gave;</p>
<p>Think ye he meant them for a slave?</p>
<p>Fill high the howl with Samian wine!</p>
<p>We will not think of themes like these!</p>
<p>It made Anacreon’s song divine:</p>
<p>He served, but served Polycrates,</p>
<p>A tyrant; but our masters then</p>
<p>Were still, at least, Our countrymen.</p>
<p>The tyrant of the Chersonese</p>
<p>Was freedom’s best and bravest friend;</p>
<p>That tyrant was Miltiades!</p>
<p>Oh that the present hour would lend</p>
<p>Another despot of the kind!</p>
<p>Such chains as his were sure to bind.</p>
<p>Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!</p>
<p>Our virgins dance beneath the shade;</p>
<p>I see their glorious, black eyes shine;</p>
<p>But gazing on each glowing maid,</p>
<p>My own the burning tear-drop laves,</p>
<p>To think such breasts must suckle slaves.</p>
<p>Place me on Sunium’s marbled steep,</p>
<p>Where nothing save the waves and I</p>
<p>May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;</p>
<p>There, swanlike, let me sing and die:</p>
<p>A land of slaves shall ne’er be mine,—</p>
<p>Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!</p>

<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS</p>
<p>北美印第安人</p>
<p>Charles Sprague, 1791-1875, was born in Boston, and received his
education in the public schools of that city. For sixteen years he was
engaged in mercantile pursuits, as clerk and partner. In 1820 he became
teller in a bank; and, from 1825, he filled the office of cashier of the
Globe Bank for about forty years. In 1829 be gave his most famous poem,
“Curiosity,” before the Phi Beta Kappa society, in Cambridge. An active
man of business all his days, he has written but little either in prose
or poetry, but that little is excellent in quality, graceful, and
pleasing.</p>
<p>The address from which this extract is taken, was delivered before
the citizens of Boston, July 4th, 1825.</p>
<p>Not many generations ago, where you now sit, encircled with all that
exalts and embellishes civilized life, the rank thistle nodded in the
wind and the wild fox dug his hole unscared. Here lived and loved
another race of beings. Beneath the same sun that rolls over your head,
the Indian hunter pursued the panting deer; gazing on the same moon that
smiles for you, the Indian lover wooed his dusky mate. Here the wigwam
blaze beamed on the tender and helpless, and the council fire glared on
the wise and daring. Now they dipped their noble limbs in your sedgy
lakes, and now they paddled the light canoe along your rocky shores.
Here they warred; the echoing whoop, the bloody grapple, the defying
death song, all were here; and when the tiger strife was over, here
curled the smoke of peace.</p>
<p>Here, too, they worshiped; and from many a dark bosom went up a
fervent prayer to the Great Spirit. He had not written his laws for them
on tables of stone, but he had traced them on the tables of their
hearts. The poor child of nature knew not the God of Revelation, but the
God of the universe he acknowledged in everything around. He beheld him
in the star that sank in beauty behind his lonely dwelling; in the
sacred orb that flamed on him from his midday throne; in the flower that
snapped in the morning breeze; in the lofty pine that defied a thousand
whirlwinds; in the timid warbler that never left its native grove; in
the fearless eagle, whose untired pinion was wet in clouds; in the worm
that crawled at his feet; and in his own matchless form, glowing with a
spark of that light, to whose mysterious source he bent in humble though
blind adoration.</p>
<p>And all this has passed away. Across the ocean came a pilgrim bark,
bearing the seeds of life and death. The former were sown for you; the
latter sprang up in the path of the simple native. Two hundred years
have changed the character of a great continent, and blotted forever
from its face a whole, peculiar people. Art has usurped the bowers of
nature, and the anointed children of education have been too powerful
for the tribes of the ignorant. Here and there a stricken few remain;
but how unlike their bold, untamable progenitors. The Indian of falcon
glance and lion bearing, the theme of the touching ballad, the hero of
the pathetic tale is gone, and his degraded offspring crawls upon the
soil where he walked in majesty, to remind us how miserable is man when
the foot of the conqueror is on his neck.</p>
<p>As a race they have withered from the land. Their arrows are broken,
their springs are dried up, their cabins are in the dust. Their council
fire has long since gone out on the shore, and their war cry is fast
fading to the untrodden west. Slowly and sadly they climb the distant
mountains, and read their doom in the setting sun. They are shrinking
before the mighty tide which is pressing them away; they must soon hear
the roar of the last wave which will settle over them forever. Ages
hence, the inquisitive white man, as he stands by some growing city,
will ponder on the structure of their disturbed remains, and wonder to
what manner of persons they belonged. They will live only in the songs
and chronicles of their exterminators. Let these be faithful to their
rude virtues as men, and pay due tribute to their unhappy fate as a
people.</p>

<p>诸位现在所坐的地方，放眼望去，当真是一片文明世界的繁荣景象。可是不过就在几代人之前，繁茂的山蓟还在这里随风摇曳，野狐狸自由自在地掘洞安巢。我们的另一支亲族曾在这里相亲相爱。在诸位头顶上起起落落的那轮太阳，也曾照耀在追赶鹿儿的印第安猎手身上；每晚含笑凝望诸位的那片月光，也曾见证了印第安小伙向黑皮肤心上人倾诉衷肠。在这里，棚屋的火焰曾映红了妇孺的脸庞，议事会的篝火曾温暖了智者勇士的胸膛。他们曾将高贵的双腿浸入诸位身边满是莎草的湖泊，沿着怪石林立的河岸蹚水荡舟。他们曾在这里战斗；就在这里，曾经呼声震天，浴血厮杀，视死如归的战歌曾在耳边回荡；等到无情的战火熄灭后，祥和的炊烟又在这里袅袅升起。</p>
<p>这里，也曾是他们祭奠神灵的地方；多少个黝黑的胸膛中涌动着同一种滚烫的对万物之神的信仰。神明不曾在石碑上为他们写下戒律，但他却将戒律刻在了他们心上。这个贫穷的自然之子不懂得什么是神的启示，但他相信身边的一草一木、一花一石都有神在栖息。当一粒星子悠然地陨落在旷野的小屋后面，他在那里看到了他；当那颗火球戴上它正午霸气的冠冕，将炙热的火焰喷在他脸上，他在那里看到了他；当一朵鲜花在清晨的微风中喷薄怒放；当一株松柏在千万次的飞沙走石中岿然不倒；当一只胆小的鸟儿说什么也不肯离开它出生的果园；当一头无畏的秃鹰飞向云端，任由那云雾濡湿了它不知疲倦的翅膀；当一条小虫子在他脚边扭来扭去，他在那里看到了他；当他沐浴在一束火花中周身散发着光芒，那道光源正是他顶礼膜拜的对象，于是，在无与伦比的自己的身上，他看到了他。</p>
<p>这一切都已成为了过往。从海的那一边漂来一批喧嚣的清教徒，他们带来了生与死的种子。播种前者，于是有了今天在座诸位，播种后者，纯朴的原住民就此灭绝。两百年的时间偷换了这片大陆的精魂，居住在这里的奇特一族被永远地抹去，了无痕迹。手工作坊侵占了天然茅舍，受过教化的上帝之子强大得让尚未开化的部落无力招架。这里或那里也许散落着沧海遗珠；然而他们身上再也找不到祖先的勇猛刚强和豪气万丈。具有鹰隼锐目和狮王风度的印第安人，唱得让人落泪的叙事歌谣，忧伤传奇中的悲剧英雄都已经一去不返，他曾在这片土地上威严巡视，而今只剩下落魄的后裔在这里苟延残喘，这一幕不能不让我们感叹，当被征服者踩在脚下，人类会变得多么可怜卑下。</p>
<p>作为一个种族，印第安人已然在这片土地上逐渐消亡。他们的弓箭已经折断，他们的山泉已经枯竭，他们的茅屋已经化为尘土。岸边议事会的篝火早已熄灭，开战时的呐喊已飘散在杳无人烟的西方。他们步履沉重，缓缓地爬上远处的群山，在西沉的太阳下解读自己的命运。面对将他们卷裹碾压的滔天巨浪，他们缩成一团，无能为力；很快，他们就会听到最后一个浪头的怒吼，随后他们将永远地销声匿迹。岁月更替，当好奇的白人在新兴的城市边发现印第安人的遗迹，他们会苦苦思索这些废墟原有的结构，会想方设法地搞清楚究竟是谁曾经住在这里。印第安人只能活在把他们赶尽杀绝的仇人所编写的歌曲或历史里。但愿这些能忠实记录他们作为人类所具有的天然朴拙的美德，但愿这些能为他们作为一个民族所遭受的不幸命运做出应有的补偿。</p>

<p>LOCHIEL’S WARNING</p>
<p>洛琪尔的警告</p>
<p>Thomas Campbell, 1777-1844, was a descendant of the famous clan of
Campbells, in Kirnan, Scotland, and was born at Glasgow. At the age of
thirteen he entered the university in that city, from which he graduated
with distinction, especially as a Greek scholar; his translations of
Greek tragedy were considered without parallel in the history of the
university. During the first year after graduation, he wrote several
poems of minor importance. He then removed to Edinburgh and adopted
literature as his profession; here his “Pleasures of Hope” was published
in 1799, and achieved immediate success. He traveled extensively on the
continent, and during his absence wrote “Lochiel’s Warning,”
“Hohenlinden,” and other minor poems. In 1809 he published “Gertrude of
Wyoming;” from 1820 to 1830 he edited the “New Monthly Magazine.” In
1826 he was chosen lord rector of the University of Glasgow, to which
office he was twice reelected. He was active in founding the University
of London. During the last years of his life he produced but little of
note. He died at Boulogne, in France. During most of his life he was in
straitened pecuniary circumstances, and ill-health and family
afflictions cast a melancholy over his later years. His poems were
written with much care, and are uniformly smooth and musical.</p>
<p>Seer . Lochiel! Lochiel! beware of the day</p>
<p>When the Lowlands shall meet thee in battle array!</p>
<p>For a field of the dead rushes red on my sight,</p>
<p>And the clans of Culloden are scattered in fight.</p>
<p>They rally, they bleed, for their kingdom and crown;</p>
<p>Woe, woe to the riders that trample them down!</p>
<p>Proud Cumberland prances, insulting the slain,</p>
<p>And their hoof-beaten bosoms are trod to the plain.</p>
<p>But hark! through the fast-flashing lightning of war,</p>
<p>What steed to the desert flies frantic and far?</p>
<p>’T is thine, O Glenullin! whose bride shall await</p>
<p>Like a love-lighted watch fire all night at the gate.</p>
<p>A steed comes at morning,—no rider is there,</p>
<p>But its bridle is red with the sign of despair.</p>
<p>Weep, Albin! to death and captivity led!</p>
<p>Oh, weep! but thy tears can not number the dead:</p>
<p>For a merciless sword on Culloden shall wave, —</p>
<p>Culloden! that reeks with the blood of the brave.</p>
<p>Loch . Go preach to the coward, thou death-telling seer!</p>
<p>Or, if gory Culloden so dreadful appear,</p>
<p>Draw, dotard, around thy old wavering sight,</p>
<p>This mantle, to cover the phantoms of fright.</p>
<p>Seer . Ha! laugh’st thou, Lochiel, my vision to scorn?</p>
<p>Proud bird of the mountain thy plume shall be torn!</p>
<p>Say, rushed the bold eagle exultingly forth</p>
<p>From his home in the dark-rolling clouds of the north?</p>
<p>Lo! the death shot of foemen outspeeding, he rode</p>
<p>Companionless, bearing destruction abroad;</p>
<p>But down let him stoop from his havoc on high!</p>
<p>Ah! home let him speed, for the spoiler is nigh.</p>
<p>Why flames the far summit? Why shoot to the blast</p>
<p>Those embers, like stars from the firmament cast?</p>
<p>’T is the fire shower of ruin, all dreadfully driven</p>
<p>From his eyrie that beacons the darkness of heaven,</p>
<p>O crested Lochiel! the peerless in might,</p>
<p>Whose banners arise on the battlements’ height,</p>
<p>Heaven’s fire is around thee, to blast and to burn;</p>
<p>Return to thy dwelling! all lonely return!</p>
<p>For the blackness of ashes shall mark where it stood,</p>
<p>And a wild mother scream o’er her famishing brood.</p>
<p>Loch . False wizard, avaunt! I have marshaled my clan, Their swords
are a thousand, their bosoms are one!</p>
<p>They are true to the last of their blood and their breath,</p>
<p>And like reapers descend to the harvest of death.</p>
<p>Then welcome be Cumberland’s steed to the shock!</p>
<p>Let him dash his proud foam like a wave on the rock!</p>
<p>But woe to his kindred, and woe to his cause,</p>
<p>When Albin her claymore indignantly draws;</p>
<p>When her bonneted chieftains to victory crowd, Clanronald the
dauntless, and Moray the proud,</p>
<p>All plaided and plumed in their tartan array—</p>
<p>Seer . —Lochiel, Lochiel, beware of the day!</p>
<p>For, dark and despairing, my sight I may seal,</p>
<p>But man can not cover what God would reveal:</p>
<p>’T is the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,</p>
<p>And coming events cast their shadows before.</p>
<p>I tell thee, Culloden’s dread echoes shall ring</p>
<p>With the bloodhounds that bark for thy fugitive king.</p>
<p>Lo! anointed by heaven with the vials of wrath,</p>
<p>Behold where he flies on his desolate path!</p>
<p>Now, in darkness and billows, he sweeps from my sight:</p>
<p>Rise, rise! ye wild tempests, and cover his flight!</p>
<p>’T is finished. Their thunders are hushed on the moors; Culloden is
lost, and my country deplores.</p>
<p>But where is the ironbound prisoner? Where?</p>
<p>For the red eye of battle is shut in despair.</p>
<p>Say, mounts he the ocean wave, banished, forlorn,</p>
<p>Like a limb from his country, cast bleeding and torn?</p>
<p>Ah no! for a darker departure is near;</p>
<p>The war drum is muffled, and black is the bier;</p>
<p>His death bell is tolling; O mercy, dispel</p>
<p>Yon sight that it freezes my spirit to tell!</p>
<p>Life flutters convulsed in his quivering limbs,</p>
<p>And his blood-streaming nostril in agony swims.</p>
<p>Accursed be the fagots that blaze at his feet,</p>
<p>Where his heart shall be thrown ere it ceases to beat,</p>
<p>With the smoke of its ashes to poison the gale—</p>
<p>Loch . Down, soothless insulter! I trust not the tale:</p>
<p>For never shall Albin a destiny meet</p>
<p>So black with dishonor, so foul with retreat.</p>
<p>Though my perishing ranks should be strewed in their gore, Like ocean
weeds heaped on the surf-beaten shore,</p>
<p>Lochiel, untainted by flight or by chains,</p>
<p>While the kindling of life in his bosom remains,</p>
<p>Shall victor exult, or in death be laid low,</p>
<p>With his back to the field and his feet to the foe!</p>
<p>And leaving in battle no blot on his name,</p>
<p>Look proudly to heaven from the deathbed of fame.</p>

<p>像不像勇猛的老鹰得意扬扬</p>
<p>从巢穴飞向乌云翻滚的北方？</p>
<p>看！一颗致命的子弹正在把他追赶，</p>
<p>他孤独地飞翔着，经受着四方的磨难；</p>
<p>就让他躲开空中的浩劫飞扑而下！</p>
<p>啊，让他迅速返巢，因为敌人就在近旁。</p>
<p>为什么高山之巅燃起了火焰？为什么一簇簇余火</p>
<p>如同天空洒落的星星那样射向暴风雨？</p>
<p>这是毁灭一切的流火，从他的鹰巢</p>
<p>射落，照亮了漆黑的天空。</p>
<p>啊，带着羽饰的洛琪尔，你的威力无人能比，</p>
<p>城垛上飘扬着你的军旗，</p>
<p>上天的流火已经逼近，或是引爆，或是付之一炬；</p>
<p>返回你的住处，只身一人，快快回去！</p>
<p>因为黑色的灰烬指明了鹰巢的所在地，</p>
<p>绝望盘旋的母亲正望着饿得奄奄一息的幼崽叫声凄厉。</p>
<p>洛琪尔 滚开，妖言惑众的巫师！我的部下已整装待发，</p>
<p>他们剑有千把，心只一条！</p>
<p>他们的忠心会让他们流尽最后一滴血，呼尽最后一口气，</p>
<p>他们就像等待收获的农民弯下腰去收割敌人的死讯。</p>
<p>然后，欢迎坎伯兰的马匹受我一击！</p>
<p>让马上的人口吐白沫就像白浪拍碎在岸礁！</p>
<p>替他的亲朋好友悲伤吧，为他的宏图大业哀叹吧，</p>
<p>当阿尔宾愤怒地抽出她的宽剑；</p>
<p>当她为必胜的族长们拉下帽檐，</p>
<p>不屈不挠的可兰若诺德族，英勇善战的马里族，</p>
<p>他们穿着花格呢的盛装，上面配着华美的羽毛——</p>
<p>先 知 ——洛琪尔，洛琪尔，千万小心那一天！</p>
<p>因为我发誓我看到了恐怖与绝望，</p>
<p>可人类不能对上帝的启示视而不见：</p>
<p>就在人生将尽，上帝给了我先见之明，</p>
<p>事情尚未发生，我已看见阴影已经逼近。</p>
<p>我告诉你，悲号惨叫将会回荡在卡洛登</p>
<p>伴随着追踪你那逃亡君主的猎犬的狂吠。</p>
<p>看！被上帝选中的君主满脸愤怒，</p>
<p>他慌不择路逃到了一条荒僻的小路！</p>
<p>现在，在茫茫夜色里，他的身影消失在滔天巨浪中：</p>
<p>升起来，升起来，狂风骤雨阻断了他的去路！</p>
<p>都结束了。沼泽荒野上不再电闪雷鸣；</p>
<p>我们输了卡洛登之役，我的祖国在哭泣。</p>
<p>可是那带着锁链的洛琪尔在哪里？在哪里？</p>
<p>因为战争已经绝望地闭上了杀红了的眼。</p>
<p>难道，他也爬上了浪尖，遭到流放，从此孤苦伶仃，</p>
<p>像是从他的祖国身上扯下的一条臂膀，血肉模糊，被随意丢弃？</p>
<p>啊，不！更可怕的离别就在眼前；</p>
<p>战鼓低沉，那黑黢黢的是口棺木；</p>
<p>丧钟已为他敲响，啊，发发慈悲，</p>
<p>别再让我看到那魂飞魄散的一幕！</p>
<p>生命力还在他抽搐的肢体里颤动，</p>
<p>鲜血直流的鼻孔里浸满了苦痛，</p>
<p>诅咒那把柴火正在舔舐他的双脚，</p>
<p>那颗心脏在停止跳动前就会被扔掉，</p>
<p>燃烧的灰烬随着青烟吹进了风里——</p>
<p>洛琪尔 去死吧，你这胡言乱语的家伙！你说的我一个字都不信：</p>
<p>因为阿尔宾绝不会遭遇</p>
<p>像惨败这样可怕，像退缩这样耻辱的命运。</p>
<p>就算我的士兵会在血泊中倒下，</p>
<p>如同随浪堆积在岸边的海草，</p>
<p>洛琪尔，不容逃跑或被俘玷污他的英名，</p>
<p>只要有生命的火花还在胸膛里跳动，</p>
<p>他就会为胜利欢呼，或者战死沙场，</p>
<p>让他的身体躺在大地，让他的双脚指向死敌！</p>
<p>战场上没有什么能诋毁他的清誉，</p>
<p>临终前他会心怀坦荡，无比骄傲地望向上帝。</p>

<p>ON HAPPINESS OF TEMPER</p>
<p>快乐的性情</p>
<p>Oliver Goldsmith, 1728-1774. This eccentric son of genius was an
Irishman; his father was a poor curate. Goldsmith received his education
at several preparatory schools, at Trinity College, Dublin, at
Edinburgh, and at Leyden. He was indolent and unruly as a student, often
in disgrace with his teachers; but his generosity, recklessness, and
love of athletic sports made him a favorite with his fellow-students. He
spent some time in wandering over the continent, often in poverty and
want. In 1756 he returned to England, and soon took up his abode in
London. Here he made the acquaintance and friendship of several notable
men, among whom were Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. “The Traveler” was
published in 1764, and was soon followed by the “Vicar of Wakefield.” He
wrote in nearly all departments of literature, and always with purity,
grace, and fluency. His fame as a poet is secured by the “Traveler” and
the “Deserted Village;” as a dramatist, by “She Stoops to Conquer;” as a
satirist, by the “Citizen of the World;” and as a novelist by the “Vicar
of Wakefield.” In his later years his writings were the source of a
large income, but his gambling, careless generosity, and reckless
extravagance always kept him in financial difficulty, and he died
heavily in debt. His monument is in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>Writers of every age have endeavored to show that pleasure is in us,
and not in the objects offered for our amusement. If the soul be happily
disposed, everything becomes capable of affording entertainment, and
distress will almost want a name. Every occurrence passes in review,
like the figures of a procession; some may be awkward, others
ill-dressed, but none but a fool is on that account enraged with the
master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>I remember to have once seen a slave, in a fortification in Flanders,
who appeared no way touched with his situation. He was maimed, deformed,
and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till nightfall,
and condemned to this for life; yet, with all these circumstances of
apparent wretchedness, he sang, would have danced, but that he wanted a
leg, and appeared the merriest, happiest man of all the garrison. What a
practical philosopher was here! A happy constitution supplied
philosophy, and though seemingly destitute of wisdom he was really wise.
No reading or study had contributed to disenchant the fairyland around
him. Everything furnished him with an opportunity of mirth; and though
some thought him, from his insensibility, a fool, he was such an idiot
as philosophers should wish to imitate.</p>
<p>They who, like that slave, can place themselves all that side of the
world in which everything appears in a pleasant light, will find
something in every occurrence to excite their good humor. The most
calamitous events, either to themselves or others, can bring no new
affliction; the world is to them a theater, in which only comedies are
acted. All the bustle of heroism, or the aspirations of ambition, seem
only to heighten the absurdity of the scene, and make the humor more
poignant. They feel, in short, as little anguish at their own distress,
or the complaints of others, as the undertaker, though dressed in black,
feels sorrow at a funeral. Of all the men I ever read of, the famous
Cardinal de Retz possessed this happiness in the highest degree. When
fortune wore her angriest look, and he fell into the power of Cardinal
Mazarin, his most deadly enemy, (being confined a close prisoner in the
castle of Valenciennes,) he never attempted to support his distress by
wisdom or philosophy, for he pretended to neither. He only laughed at
himself’ and his persecutor, and seemed infinitely pleased at his new
situation. In this mansion of distress, though denied all amusements,
and even the conveniences of life, and entirely cut off from all
intercourse with his friends, he still retained his good humor, laughed
at the little spite of his enemies, and carried the jest so far as to
write the life of his jailer.</p>
<p>All that the wisdom of the proud can teach, is to be stubborn or
sullen under misfortunes. The Cardinal’s example will teach us to be
good-humored in circumstances of the highest affliction. It matters not
whether our good humor be construed by others into insensibility or
idiotism,—it is happiness to ourselves; and none but a fool could
measure his satisfaction by what the world thinks of it.</p>
<p>The happiest fellow I ever knew, was of the number of those
good-natured creatures that are said to do no harm to anybody but
themselves. Whenever he fell into any misery, he called it “seeing
life,” If his head was broken by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a
sharper, he comforted himself by imitating the Hibernian dialect of the
one, or the more fashionable cant of the other. Nothing came amiss to
him. His inattention to money matters had concerned his father to such a
degree that all intercession of friends was fruitless. The old gentleman
was on his deathbed. The whole family (and Dick among the number)
gathered around him.</p>
<p>“I leave my second son, Andrew,” said the expiring miser, “my whole
estate, and desire him to be frugal.” Andrew, in a sorrowful tone (as is
usual on such occasions), prayed heaven to prolong his life and health
to enjoy it himself. “I recommend Simon, my third son, to the care of
his elder brother, and leave him, besides, four thousand pounds.” “Ah,
father!” cried Simon (in great affliction, to be sure), “may heaven give
you life and health to enjoy it yourself!” At last, turning to poor
Dick: “As for you, you have always been a sad dog; you’ll never come to
good; you’ll never be rich; I leave you a shilling to buy a halter.”
“Ah, father!” cries Dick, without any emotion, “may heaven give you life
and health to enjoy it yourself!”</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-501">中文阅读</h4>
<p>每个时代的作家都想方设法地让我们明白，快乐存在于我们内心，而不在于取悦我们的东西上。只要内心愿意快乐，那么所有的一切都能娱乐我们，而悲伤这个词将会变得可有可无。我们回顾每一件事情，就像在看游行队伍中的每一个人；有的看上去笨手笨脚，有的穿得不太得体，但是除了傻瓜，谁也不会因此去怪罪穿戴举止适宜的人。</p>
<p>我记得曾经在弗兰德斯防御工事的工地上见过一个苦力，他对于自己所处的环境似乎毫不在意。他四肢不全，带着锁链；每天都要从东方微明一直苦干到夜幕降临才能勉强维持生计；可就是在这种旁人看来无比悲惨的环境中，他快乐地歌唱着，要不是少了一条腿，他肯定还会跳上一段，整个驻地上似乎要属他最开心、最幸福了。这是一位多么接地气的哲学家啊！快乐的秉性构筑了达观的人生哲学，虽然他看上去痴痴傻傻，实际上却是真正有大智慧的人。他目不识丁，胸无点墨，所以他没有机会接触诗文，从中获知什么是乐园仙境。对他而言，身边的一切都能让他开怀；虽然有人会因为他的不在乎而认定他是个傻瓜，可这却是连哲学家都巴不得能成为的傻瓜。</p>
<p>那些能像这位苦力一样的人，他们都会选择这样一个位置来看待世界，从这个角度放眼望去，所有的一切都能展示出令人愉悦的光明一面，于是他们会发现所有的事物都会激发他们的好心情。即便遇到最不幸的事情，无论对于他们自身还是他人，都不会带来更痛苦的折磨。世界在他们眼中就是一个舞台，在那里只有喜剧上演。所有喧嚣扰攘的英雄事迹或者轰轰烈烈的抱负追求，不过是为了让荒诞一幕更加滑稽，让幽默的效果更深入人心。简而言之，他们对于自己遭受的不幸或是别人加诸的怨恨所感到的苦楚，不会多于葬礼上的司仪，尽管他也穿着黑衣，满脸悲戚。在我所知的所有人当中，红衣主教莱兹是把这种幸福感发挥到极致的人。当命运女神朝他露出狰狞的表情，他不幸落入了宿敌红衣主教马萨林手中，被囚禁于瓦朗谢讷城堡，他从未试图用智慧或哲学来排解痛苦，因为他自称对于二者都一窍不通。他只是不断地自嘲，以及嘲笑那些迫害他的人，就好像在这个新环境里他发现了无限乐趣。这栋阴郁悲惨的宅邸，没有任何娱乐，甚至缺乏生活设施，并且禁止他与朋友有任何往来联系，但他依旧保持舒畅的心情，敌人的恶意刁难在他眼里全成了笑柄，他甚至为狱卒写起了传记，将戏谑嘲弄进行到底。</p>
<p>凡是骄傲自负的人，他们的智慧只会让他们在遭受不幸时变得冥顽不化，郁郁寡欢。而红衣主教的例子却告诉我们，即便是在最暗无边际的苦痛中依然要保持灿烂的心境。别人会不会把我们的好心情解读为满不在乎或愚钝无感，这都无关紧要——关键是我们自己感到快乐；只有傻瓜才会根据外界的看法来衡量、判断自己的满足感。</p>
<p>据说许多温良敦厚的人宁可自己吃苦也不会伤害他人，我所认识的最快乐的人便是他们其中的一个。每次碰到什么倒霉事，到了他身上全成了“长见识”。如果他的轿夫不小心把他摔了，让他磕破了脑袋，或是他被骗子骗走了钱财，他会模仿轿夫的爱尔兰口音或骗子的江湖切口来安慰自己。在他眼里，世上的一切都是顺心顺意的。他对于财物方面的漫不经心让他的父亲极为焦虑，任凭朋友如何劝解都无济于事。老先生临终时，他的家人（迪克也在其中）都守在他的病榻前。</p>
<p>“我把我所有的房产，”这位大限将至的守财奴说，“留给我的次子安德鲁，希望他不要大手大脚。”安德鲁，语带悲切（就如这样的场合中惯用的语气），祈求上帝让他父亲活得长久些，好亲自享用他的房产。“我把我的三子，西蒙，托付给他的二哥，同时留给西蒙四千英镑。”“啊，父亲！”西蒙哭喊道（自然，悲伤万分），“愿上帝让你长命百岁，身体健康，自己享用这笔财富！”最后，他转向迪克：“至于你，你一向放荡不羁；也不指望你会浪子回头；你这辈子永远也发不了财；我留给你一个先令去买副笼头把自己拴上吧。”“啊，父亲！”迪克大喊道，声音里不带一丝感情，“愿上帝让你长命百岁，身体健康，好自己享用这副笼头！”</p>

<p>THE FORTUNE TELLER</p>
<p>算命先生</p>
<p>Henry Mackenzie, 1745-1831, was born in Edinburgh, educated at the
university there, and died in the same city. He was an attorney by
profession, and was the associate of many famous literary men residing
at that time in Edinburgh. His fame as a writer rests chiefly on two
novels, “The Man of Feeling” and “The Man of the World;” both were
published before the author was forty years old.</p>
<p>Harley sat down on a large stone by the wayside, to take a pebble
from his shoe, when he saw, at some distance, a beggar approaching him.
He had on a loose sort of coat, mended with different-colored rags,
among which the blue and russet were predominant. He had a short, knotty
stick in his hand, and on the top of it was stuck a ram’s horn; he wore
no shoes, and his stockings had entirely lost that part of them which
would have covered his feet and ankles; in his face, however, was the
plump appearance of good humor; he walked a good, round pace, and a
crook-legged dog trotted at his heels.</p>
<p>“Our delicacies,” said Harley to himself, “are fantastic; they are
not in nature! That beggar walks over the sharpest of these stones
barefooted, whilst I have lost the most delightful dream in the world
from the smallest of them happening to get into my shoe.” The beggar had
by this time come up, and, pulling off a piece of a hat, asked charity
of Harley. The dog began to beg, too. It was impossible to resist both;
and, in truth, the want of shoes and stockings had made both
unnecessary, for Harley had destined sixpence for him before.</p>
<p>The beggar, on receiving it, poured forth blessings without number;
and, with a sort of smile on his countenance, said to Harley that if he
wanted to have his fortune told—Harley turned his eye briskly upon the
beggar; it was an unpromising look for the subject of a prediction, and
silenced the prophet immediately. “I would much rather learn” said
Harley, “what it is in your power to tell me. Your trade must be an
entertaining one; sit down on this stone, and let me know something of
your profession; I have often thought of turning fortune teller for a
week or two, myself.”</p>
<p>“Master,” replied the beggar, “I like your frankness much, for I had
the humor of plain dealing in me from a child; but there is no doing
with it in this world,—we must do as we can; and lying is, as you call
it, my profession. But I was in some sort forced to the trade, for I
once dealt in telling the truth. I was a laborer, sir, and gained as
much as to make me live. I never laid by, indeed, for I was reckoned a
piece of a wag, and your wags, I take it, are seldom rich, Mr. Harley.”
“So,” said Harley, “you seem to know me.” “Ay, there are few folks in
the country that I do n’t know something of. How should I tell fortunes
else?” “True, —but go on with your story; you were a laborer, you say,
and a wag; your industry, I suppose, you left with your old trade; but
your humor you preserved to be of use to you in your new.”</p>
<p>“What signifies sadness, sir? A man grows lean on’t. But I was
brought to my idleness by degrees; sickness first disabled me, and it
went against my stomach to work, ever after. But, in truth, I was for a
long time so weak that I spit blood whenever I attempted to work. I had
no relation living, and I never kept a friend above a week when I was
able to joke. Thus I was forced to beg my bread, and a sorry trade I
have found it, Mr. Harley. I told all my misfortunes truly, but they
were seldom believed; and the few who gave me a half-penny as they
passed, did it with a shake of the head, and an injunction not to
trouble them with a long story. In short, I found that people do n’t
care to give alms without some security for their money,—such as a
wooden leg, or a withered arm, for example. So I changed my plan, and
instead of telling my own misfortunes, began to prophesy happiness to
others.</p>
<p>“This I found by much the better way. Folks will always listen when
the tale is their own, and of many who say they do not believe in
fortune telling, I have known few on whom it had not a very sensible
effect. I pick up the names of their acquaintance; amours and little
squabbles are easily gleaned from among servants and neighbors; and,
indeed, people themselves are the best intelligencers in the world for
our purpose. They dare not puzzle us for their own sakes, for everyone
is anxious to hear what he wishes to believe; and they who repeat it, to
laugh at it when they have done, are generally more serious than their
hearers are apt to imagine. With a tolerably good memory, and some share
of cunning, I succeed reasonably well as a fortune teller. With this,
and showing the tricks of that dog, I make shift to pick up a
livelihood.</p>
<p>“My trade is none of the most honest, yet people are not much cheated
after all, who give a few half-pence for a prospect of happiness, which
I have heard some persons say, is all a man can arrive at in this world.
But I must bid you good day, sir; for I have three miles to walk before
noon, to inform some boarding-school young ladies whether their husbands
are to be peers of the realm or captains in the army; a question which I
promised to answer them by that time.”</p>
<p>Harley had drawn a shilling from his pocket; but Virtue bade him to
consider on whom he was going to bestow it. Virtue held back his arm;
but a milder form, a younger sister of Virtue’s, not so severe as
Virtue, nor so serious as Pity, smiled upon him; his fingers lost their
compression; nor did Virtue appear to catch the money as it fell. It had
no sooner reached the ground than the watchful cur (a trick he had been
taught) snapped it up; and, contrary to the most approved method of
stewardship, delivered it immediately into the hands of his master.</p>

<p>哈利坐在路旁的大石头上，想把一不小心溜进鞋子的石子儿给取出来，这时，他看到不远处慢慢走来一个乞丐。这乞丐穿了一件肥大的外套，上面打满了不同颜色的补丁，其中以蓝色和褐色最为显眼。他拄着一根满是结疤的短木棍，顶端插着一只公羊犄角；他光着脚，脚上的袜子早已破得遮不住脚掌和脚踝了；不过看他的神情倒是一脸满足；他迈着轻快的步子，一条罗圈腿的小狗一路小跑跟在身后。</p>
<p>“所谓的皮娇肉嫩，”哈利自言自语道，“都是凭空想象而已；其实压根儿就没那回事！瞧这个乞丐光着脚走在那么坚硬的石头上，可一颗最小的石子儿却让我不堪其扰，难以忍受。”说话间，那乞丐已经走到跟前，脱下了帽子，乞求哈利能施舍几个子儿。身后的狗也替主人帮腔。哈利无法拒绝他俩；事实上，光看乞丐没穿鞋的脚和惨不忍睹的袜子，即便他们不开口，哈利也已经准备给他六便士了。</p>
<p>乞丐接过钱，说了一大堆祝福的话；而后他似笑非笑地问哈利想不想算上一卦——哈利迅速抬眼打量了一下乞丐；这人怎么看都不像是能掐会算的人，于是立马打断了这位预言家的话。“我更想知道，”哈利说，“你凭什么说自己有能力预知未来。做你们这行说的话肯定都不能当真；来，坐下来，跟我讲讲这一行究竟是怎么一回事；这一两个礼拜，我一直在考虑是不是要转行做一个算命先生。”</p>
<p>“先生，”乞丐答道，“我喜欢您的坦率，小时候我也是一个光明磊落、有啥说啥的人；不过这世道已经不吃这一套了，——我们也好随波逐流了；就像您所说的那样，撒谎就是我的职业。但我多少也是被逼无奈入的这一行，我以前也只说真话来着。先生，我打过工，赚来的钱正好能让我勉强过活。我从不存钱，事实上，我被人当作小丑，我想小丑一般都发不了财的，哈利先生。”“这么看来，”哈利说，“你好像认识我。”“唉，这里没有几个人是我不认识的。要不，我怎么给人算命呢？”“没错——不过还是说说你自己的事吧；你说你打过工，扮成小丑；我想，你已经把你的勤劳遗留在了上一份工作；不过你的幽默倒是能在新工作里派上用场。”</p>
<p>“忧伤会把人变成什么样子，先生？人会变得一天比一天憔悴。我也不是一夜之间变成懒鬼的；先是疾病让我丧失了工作能力，之后又剥夺了我工作的劲头。事实上，很长一段时间里我都很虚弱，每次尝试干活的时候都会吐血。我没有亲人活在世上，在我还能耍嘴皮子说笑话的时候，没有一个朋友能和我交往超过一个礼拜的。所以，我不得不以乞讨为生，这份工作可真叫人难受，哈利先生。我所说的这些不幸都是真的，可是没人会信；有几个人打我身边经过时，曾给过半个便士，他们一边给钱一边摇着头，警告说他们可没工夫听我啰嗦个没完。简单点说吧，我发现人们都不愿意施舍点啥给我，除非他们手中抄着什么家伙能保证自己的财物安全无虞，有时是一条木腿，有时是一截萎缩的手臂。所以，我换了个活法，不再对人诉说自己的苦难，转而为别人占卜幸福了。</p>
<p>我发现这比乞讨强多了。人们都爱听和自己有关的事，许多人口口声声说自己不相信算命，可只要和自己沾边，几乎没人不会听上一听的。我从他们相识那里知道他们的名字，从他们的仆人邻居那儿很容易打听到他们的风流韵事，两口子吵架的鸡毛蒜皮；而且，说真的，在这个世界上，向我们通风报信的最好的告密者，就是他们本人。为了自己，他们可不敢糊弄我们，因为每个人都急于听到他们愿意相信的事儿；我一本正经地重复他们刚刚说过的话，脸上的神情比他们能想象到的更煞有介事，而每次说完后看着他们，我都会暗自发笑。还算不赖的记忆力加上一些小聪明，算命这一行我理所当然干得风生水起了。有了这本事，然后再让这条狗耍上几招把戏，我就转行靠算命来维持生计了。</p>
<p>这一行的确不够光明正大，但您非得说人们被骗得有多惨，那倒也不见得，他们花上一点点钱买一个幸福的憧憬，我听几个人算完命后感慨，说这一卦测得的未来如此美好，人生在世所有好事加在一块儿，也不过如此了。好了，先生，我得和您告别了；因为中午前我还要赶三里路，去告诉寄宿学校里那几位年轻女士，将来他们的丈夫究竟是王国的名门望族，还是军队里的达官显贵；我答应过她们中午前会告诉她们答案的。”</p>
<p>哈利已经从口袋里掏出了一先令；不过道德命令他想一想这一先令要给的对象。道德把他的胳膊往后拽；不过长得比道德温婉一些的妹妹正朝着他微笑，她既不像道德那么严厉，也不像同情那么正儿八经；他的手指松开了些；当手里的钱往下掉的时候，道德也索性撒手不管了。钱刚落地，那条虎视眈眈的杂种狗就窜了上去一口叼起了硬币（这是乞丐先前教过的一招）；它倒是没有把钱代为保管一会儿，而是立时交到了主人手里。</p>

<p>RIENZI’S ADDRESS TO THE ROMANS</p>
<p>黎恩济对罗马人的演讲</p>
<p>Mary Russell Mitford, 1786-1855. She was the daughter of a physician,
and was born in Hampshire, England. At twenty years of age, she
published three volumes of poems; and soon after entered upon literature
as a lifelong occupation. She wrote tales, sketches, poems, and dramas.
“Our Village” is the best known of her prose works; the book describes
the daily life of a rural people, is simple but finished in style, and
is marked by mingled humor and pathos. Her most noted drama is “Rienzi.”
Miss Mitford passed the last forty years of her life in a little cottage
in Berkshire, among a simple, country people, to whom she was greatly
endeared by her kindness and social virtues.</p>
<p>I come not here to talk. You know too well</p>
<p>The story of our thraldom. We are slaves!</p>
<p>The bright sun rises to his course, and lights</p>
<p>A race of slaves! He sets, and his last beams</p>
<p>Fall on a slave; not such as, swept along</p>
<p>By the full tide of power, the conqueror led</p>
<p>To crimson glory and undying fame;</p>
<p>But base, ignoble slaves; slaves to a horde</p>
<p>Of petty tyrants, feudal despots, lords,</p>
<p>Rich in some dozen paltry villages;</p>
<p>Strong in some hundred spearmen; only great</p>
<p>In that strange spell,—a name.</p>
<p>Each hour, dark fraud,</p>
<p>Or open rapine, or protected murder,</p>
<p>Cries out against them. But this very day,</p>
<p>An honest man, my neighbor,—there he stands,—</p>
<p>Was struck—struck like a dog, by one who wore</p>
<p>The badge of Ursini; because, forsooth,</p>
<p>He tossed not high his ready cap in air,</p>
<p>Nor lifted up his voice in servile shouts,</p>
<p>At sight of that great ruffian! Be we men,</p>
<p>And suffer such dishonor? men, and wash not</p>
<p>The stain away in blood? Such shames are common.</p>
<p>I have known deeper wrongs; I that speak to ye,</p>
<p>I had a brother once—a gracious boy,</p>
<p>Full of all gentleness, of calmest hope,</p>
<p>Of sweet and quiet joy, —there was the look</p>
<p>Of heaven upon his face, which limners give</p>
<p>To the beloved disciple.</p>
<p>How I loved</p>
<p>That gracious boy! Younger by fifteen years,</p>
<p>Brother at once, and son! He left my side,</p>
<p>A summer bloom on his fair cheek; a smile</p>
<p>Parting his innocent lips. In one short hour,</p>
<p>That pretty, harmless boy was slain! I saw</p>
<p>The corse, the mangled corse, and then I cried</p>
<p>For vengeance! Rouse, ye Romans! rouse, ye slaves!</p>
<p>Have ye brave sons? Look in the next fierce brawl</p>
<p>To see them die. Have ye fair daughters? Look</p>
<p>To see them live, torn from your arms, distained,</p>
<p>Dishonored; and if ye dare call for justice,</p>
<p>Be answered by the lash.</p>
<p>Yet this is Rome,</p>
<p>That sat on her seven hills, and from her throne</p>
<p>Of beauty ruled the world! and we are Romans.</p>
<p>Why, in that elder day, to be a Roman</p>
<p>Was greater than a king!</p>
<p>And once again,—</p>
<p>Hear me, ye walls that echoed to the tread</p>

<p>我来这里不想多说废话。你们都太清楚</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF THE PURITAN FATHERS OF NEW ENGLAND</p>
<p>新英格兰清教徒先辈的品质</p>
<p>One of the most prominent features which distinguished our
forefathers, was their determined resistance to oppression. They seemed
born and brought up for the high and special purpose of showing to the
world that the civil and religious rights of man—the rights of
self-government, of conscience, and independent thought—are not merely
things to be talked of and woven into theories, but to be adopted with
the whole strength and ardor of the mind, and felt in the profoundest
recesses of the heart, and carried out into the general life, and made
the foundation of practical usefulness, and visible beauty, and true
nobility.</p>
<p>Liberty, with them, was an object of too serious desire and stern
resolve to be personified, allegorized, and enshrined. They made no
goddess of it, as the ancients did; they had no time nor inclination for
such trifling; they felt that liberty was the simple birthright of every
human creature; they called it so; they claimed it as such; they
reverenced and held it fast as the unalienable gift of the Creator,
which was not to be surrendered to power, nor sold for wages.</p>
<p>It was theirs, as men; without it, they did not esteem themselves
men; more than any other privilege or possession, it was essential to
their happiness, for it was essential to their original nature; and
therefore they preferred it above wealth, and ease, and country; and,
that they might enjoy and exercise it fully, they forsook houses, and
lands, and kindred, their homes, their native soil, and their fathers’
graves.</p>
<p>They left all these; they left England, which, whatever it might have
been called, was not to them a land of freedom; they launched forth on
the pathless ocean, the wide, fathomless ocean, soiled not by the earth
beneath, and bounded, all round and above, only by heaven; and it seemed
to them like that better and sublimer freedom, which their country knew
not, but of which they had the conception and image in their hearts;
and, after a toilsome and painful voyage, they came to a hard and wintry
coast, unfruitful and desolate, but unguarded and boundless; its calm
silence interrupted not the ascent of their prayers; it had no eyes to
watch, no ears to hearken, no tongues to report of them; here, again,
there was an answer to their soul’s desire, and they were satisfied, and
gave thanks; they saw that they were free, and the desert smiled.</p>
<p>I am telling an old tale; but it is one which must be told when we
speak of those men. It is to be added, that they transmitted their
principles to their children, and that, peopled by such a race, our
country was always free. So long as its inhabitants were unmolested by
the mother country in the exercise of their important rights, they
submitted to the form of English government; but when those rights were
invaded, they spurned even the form away.</p>
<p>This act was the Revolution, which came of course and spontaneously,
and had nothing in it of the wonderful or unforeseen. The wonder would
have been if it had not occurred. It was, indeed, a happy and glorious
event, but by no means unnatural; and I intend no slight to the revered
actors in the Revolution when I assert that their fathers before them
were as free as they—every whit as free.</p>
<p>The principles of the Revolution were not the suddenly acquired
property of a few bosoms: they were abroad in the land in the ages
before; they had always been taught, like the truths of the Bible; they
had descended from father to son, down from those primitive days, when
the Pilgrim, established in his simple dwelling, and seated at his
blazing fire, piled high from the forest which shaded his door, repeated
to his listening children the story of his wrongs and his resistance,
and bade them rejoice, though the wild winds and the wild beasts were
howling without, that they had nothing to fear from great men’s
oppression.</p>
<p>Here are the beginnings of the Revolution. Every settler’s hearth was
a school of independence; the scholars were apt, and the lessons sunk
deeply; and thus it came that our country was always free; it could not
be other than free.</p>
<p>As deeply seated as was the principle of liberty and resistance to
arbitrary power in the breasts of the Puritans, it was not more so than
their piety and sense of religious obligation. They were emphatically a
people whose God was the Lord. Their form of government was as strictly
theocratical, if direct communication be excepted, as was that of the
Jews; insomuch that it would be difficult to say where there was any
civil authority among them entirely distinct from ecclesiastical
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Whenever a few of them settled a town, they immediately gathered
themselves into a church; and their elders were magistrates, and their
code of laws was the Pentateuch. These were forms, it is true, but forms
which faithfully indicated principles and feelings; for no people could
have adopted such forms, who were not thoroughly imbued with the spirit,
and bent on the practice, of religion.</p>
<p>God was their King; and they regarded him as truly and literally so,
as if he had dwelt in a visible palace in the midst of their state. They
were his devoted, resolute, humble subjects; they undertook nothing
which they did not beg of him to prosper; they accomplished nothing
without rendering to him the praise; they suffered nothing without
carrying their sorrows to his throne; they ate nothing which they did
not implore him to bless.</p>
<p>Their piety was not merely external; it was sincere; it had the proof
of a good tree in bearing good fruit; it produced and sustained a strict
morality. Their tenacious purity of manners and speech obtained for
them, in the mother country, their name of Puritans, which, though given
in derision, was as honorable an appellation as was ever bestowed by man
on man.</p>
<p>That there were hypocrites among them, is not to be doubted; but they
were rare. The men who voluntarily exiled themselves to an unknown
coast, and endured there every toil and hardship for conscience’ sake,
and that they might serve God in their own manner, were not likely to
set conscience at defiance, and make the service of God a mockery; they
were not likely to be, neither were they, hypocrites. I do not know that
it would be arrogating too much for them to say, that, on the extended
surface of the globe, there was not a single community of men to be
compared with them, in the respects of deep religious impressions and an
exact performance of moral duty.</p>

<h4 id="中文阅读-504">中文阅读</h4>
<p>我们先辈身上有别于他人的最为突出的特点，就是他们面对压迫时那种不屈不挠的反抗精神。似乎他们生来就是为了向世界宣告这一特殊使命，即人类的民权和宗教权利——自治权、信仰权、抗议权——不仅仅只是说说而已，或者只是变成一纸空文，而是要积聚全身心的力量与热情去接纳它们，把它们牢牢地植根在心灵最深处，在民众的日常生活中付诸实施，使它们成为所有实用、美好、真实崇高的事物的基石。</p>
<p>因为凝聚了先辈们无比肃然的愿望和无比坚定的决心，自由不可能被拟人化、寓言化或神化。我们的先辈没有像祖先那样为其创造一个膜拜的对象；他们既没有时间、也没有意愿做这些无关紧要的事；他们坚信自由是每一个人与生俱来的单纯的权利；他们这么称呼它；并这样宣告拥有它；他们敬仰它，并将之视为不可剥夺的天赋人权紧紧地握在手中，这是强权不可掠夺、金钱不可收买的。</p>
<p>作为人类，自由属于他们；没有自由，他们无法将自己尊为人；自由有别于其他任何特权或所有物，是他们幸福快乐之根，因为自由是身为人类最初始最本真的核心；故而他们将自由凌驾于财富、安逸、国家之上；他们充分地享受着自由，把它发挥得淋漓尽致，为此他们可以抛弃房舍、土地、亲族、家园、故土和他们祖先的墓地。</p>
<p>他们将这一切抛在了身后；他们离开了英国——无论那片土地有着怎样的盛名，对他们而言，也只是没有自由的土地；他们在无路可寻的大海上航行，那大海辽阔宽广、深不可测，不再脚踏泥土弄脏双足，除了海天交界处，放眼望去无边无际；对于先辈们而言，这是身在英国时无从知晓、但在心灵深处朦胧憧憬过的更加美好、更加雄浑的自由；历尽艰险与磨难，他们终于来到了肃杀寒冷的海岸，虽然荒芜清冷，却无人驻守，广袤无边；周围一片静默，没有声音打扰他们高声祈祷；没有监视的眼睛，没有偷听的耳朵，没有告密的舌头；这里，让他们灵魂深处的愿望得以实现，他们如释重负，感恩无限；他们知道他们自由了，脚下这片荒凉之地向他们展开了笑颜。</p>
<p>我说的是一个古老的故事；但当我们说起我们的先辈，这个故事就不容不说。之后，他们将他们的信条原则传承给了子孙后代，正是因为居住着这样的族群，我们的国家得以一直保持自由。只要他的母国不干涉这里的人民行使他们重要的权利，那么他们会有名无实地听命于英国政府；但如果他们的权利遭受侵犯，即便是有名无实的服从他们都会断然拒绝。</p>
<p>而拒绝的行动就是独立革命，它的到来是那么顺理成章、自然而然，没有任何疑问或悬念。如果它没有发生，那倒是令人费解了。这确是一场令人欢欣鼓舞、光辉灿烂的战争，而它的爆发是瓜熟蒂落、是水到渠成的；我要毫无保留地向那场革命中的英雄们致敬，同时我无比肯定，这些英雄的父辈们一定和他们一样热爱自由——自由已融入他们身上每一根汗毛。</p>
<p>这场战争师出有名，其要旨绝非几个人脑袋一拍临时想出来的：很久以前他们就在这片土地上普遍存在了；他们就像《圣经》上的教谕一般让人耳濡目染；从父亲到孩子，他们代代相传，回到那久远的岁月，当清教徒搭建好简陋的小屋，安坐在燃烧的炉火边，从树林里砍伐的木材垒成了高高的柴垛，火光将他们的影子投在了房门前，他向他的孩子们反复诉说着他曾遭受的不公还有他的反抗，尽管屋外狂风怒吼，野兽咆哮，孩子们依然听得心潮澎湃，父亲的故事让他们备受鼓舞，面对强敌的压迫，他们无所畏惧。</p>
<p>这就是独立革命的源头所在。每一个开拓者的炉火边就是一所教授什么叫作独立的学校；老师们无须备课，讲授的内容都是亲身体验，他们所说的每句话都被听课的孩子烙在了脑海深处。所以，自由的精神在我们国家得以薪火相传；除了自由，别无其他。</p>
<p>坚持自由与反抗专制的精神牢牢植根于清教徒心中，这同他对宗教信仰的虔诚以及宗教义务的严守如出一辙。毫无疑问，他们将上帝视为无上的主宰。他们的政府体制，如果撇开人与人的直接沟通，就像犹太人的神权政治一般严谨。因此，很难说他们之中存在着完全有别于教会裁判权的民权。</p>
<p>每当某处定居的人们慢慢发展成一个城镇，他们会立即建起教堂，在那里集结议事；年长的出任治安法官，他们制定法典的依据就是《摩西五经》。没错，这些都是形式，但是形式忠实地体现了原则与情感；因为若不是全身心地浸淫在宗教精神中，醉心于宗教活动，没有人会采用这样的形式。</p>
<p>上帝就是他们的君王；他们将他视为真实存在，就像国家中央有一处看得见的宫殿，而上帝就安住在里面一样。他们都是他虔诚、忠心、恭顺的子民；每做一件事情之前，他们都会向他乞求护佑；每当收获成功，他们都会将他的恩德赞美颂扬；每当遭遇不幸，他们都会在他的王位前细诉哀伤；每次进餐前，他们都会向他祈福祝祷。</p>
<p>他们的虔诚并不只是流于表面，而是发自内心、真挚由衷的；这就像是善良之树必定结出善良之果一样。他们的虔诚孕育并滋养了严格的道德。他们严守言谈举止的纯粹与洁净，这也是他们在母国获得清教徒称号的由来，虽然其中不乏奚落的味道，但却是从古至今，人类称号中最为光荣的一个。</p>
<p>诚然，他们之中也不乏伪君子；但为数甚少。他们自愿将自己放逐到一个不知名的海岸，为了听从良心的指引，克服了所有的艰难险阻，因为在那里他们可以用自己的方式来膜拜上帝，这样的人不可能藐视践踏道德，对上帝的崇敬不可能只是模仿作秀。他们不可能成为伪君子，也不会是伪君子。我不认为以下对于先辈的评述会有夸大其词之嫌：在世界其他地方，没有哪一族群能与我们的先辈媲美，无论是他们心怀深沉的宗教情感，还是对于道德操守的严格履行，我敢说他们都是无与伦比的。</p>

<p>LANDING OF THE PILGRIM FATHER</p>
<p>清教徒先辈们的登岸</p>
<p>Felicia Dorothea Hemans, 1794-1835, was born in Liverpool. Her
father, whose name was Browne, was an Irish merchant. She spent her
childhood in Wales, began to write poetry at a very early age, and was
married when about eighteen to Captain Hemans. By this marriage, she
became the mother of five sons; but, owing to differences of taste and
disposition, her husband left her at the end of six years; and by mutual
agreement they never again lived together. Mrs. Hemans now made
literature a profession, and wrote much and well. In 1826 Prof. Andrews
Norton brought out an edition of her poems in America, where they became
popular, and have remained so.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hemans’s poetry is smooth and graceful, frequently tinged with a
shade of melancholy, but never despairing, cynical, or misanthropic. It
never deals with the highest themes, nor rises to sublimity, but its
influence is calculated to make the reader truer, nobler, and purer.</p>
<p>The breaking waves dashed high</p>
<p>On a stern and rock-bound coast,</p>
<p>And the woods against a stormy sky</p>
<p>Their giant branches tossed;</p>
<p>And the heavy night hung dark,</p>
<p>The hills and waters o’er,</p>
<p>When a band of exiles moored their bark</p>
<p>On the wild New England shore.</p>
<p>Not as the conqueror comes,</p>
<p>They, the true-hearted, came;</p>
<p>Not with the roll of the stirring drums.</p>
<p>And the trumpet that sings of fame.</p>
<p>Not as the flying come,</p>
<p>In silence, and in fear;—</p>
<p>They shook the depths of the desert gloom</p>
<p>With their hymns of lofty cheer.</p>
<p>Amidst the storm they sang,</p>
<p>And the stars heard, and the sea;</p>
<p>And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang</p>
<p>To the anthem of the free!</p>
<p>The ocean eagle soared</p>
<p>From his nest by the white wave’s foam;</p>
<p>And the rocking pines of the forest roared,—</p>
<p>This was their welcome home.</p>
<p>There were men with hoary hair</p>
<p>Amidst that pilgrim band:</p>
<p>Why had they come to wither there,</p>
<p>Away from their childhood’s land?</p>
<p>There was woman’s fearless eye,</p>
<p>Lit by her deep love’s truth;</p>
<p>There was manhood’s brow, serenely high,</p>
<p>And the fiery heart of youth.</p>
<p>What sought they thus afar?</p>
<p>Bright jewels of the mine?</p>
<p>The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?</p>
<p>They sought a faith’s pure shrine!</p>
<p>Ay, call it holy ground,</p>
<p>The soil where first they trod:</p>
<p>They have left unstained what there they found,—</p>
<p>Freedom to worship God.</p>

<p>周围漆黑一片，夜幕沉重，</p>
<p>低垂于山林河海，</p>
<p>这时，一群亡命天涯的人将他们的小船</p>
<p>停靠在了新英格兰杳无人烟的海岸。</p>
<p>不是作为征服者来临，</p>
<p>而是一颗颗虔诚的心；</p>
<p>没有激情澎湃、急如雨点的鼓声。</p>
<p>也没有号角在那里歌功颂德。</p>
<p>不是作为逃亡者来临，</p>
<p>悄无声息，无比惊惧；——</p>
<p>他们欢欣鼓舞地高唱着赞美诗</p>
<p>将这不毛之地深处的沉闷摇撼。</p>
<p>他们在暴风雨中欢唱，</p>
<p>星星在听，海水在听；</p>
<p>昏暗的树林里，喧嚣的小径上</p>
<p>自由的颂歌响彻四方。</p>
<p>海鹰展开翅膀，尽情翱翔，</p>
<p>从他的巢穴飞到了白浪的泡沫旁；</p>
<p>林中摇摆的松树欢呼咆哮，——</p>

<p>在这群清教徒中间，</p>
<p>有白发苍苍的老者，</p>
<p>他们为何远离童年的故土，</p>
<p>来这陌生的地方等待长眠？</p>
<p>妇人眼中闪烁着无畏的目光，</p>
<p>是对真理的热爱将它点亮；</p>
<p>还有男人的额头，高洁安详，</p>
<p>还有年轻的心灵，热情激荡。</p>
<p>千山万水，他们为何而来？</p>
<p>为了金矿里闪闪发光的石头？</p>
<p>还是战利品，抑或海洋深处的宝藏？</p>
<p>他们是为了将他们的信仰找一处纯净的殿堂！</p>
<p>啊，就将他们第一次踏上的土地，</p>
<p>称之为神圣的地方：</p>
<p>他们在那里找到的至今完好无损，</p>
<p>那是对于上帝自由的信仰。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-59-4">LESSON 59</h2>
<p>NECESSITY OF EDUCATION</p>
<p>教育的必要性</p>
<p>We must educate! We must educate! or we must perish by our own
prosperity. If we do not, short will be our race from the cradle to the
grave. If, in our haste to be rich and mighty, we outrun our literary
and religious institutions, they will never overtake us; or only come up
after the battle of liberty is fought and lost, as spoils to grace the
victory, and as resources of inexorable despotism for the perpetuity of
our bondage.</p>
<p>But what will become of the West if her prosperity rushes up to such
a majesty of power, while those great institutions linger which are
necessary to form the mind, and the conscience, and the heart of the
vast world? It must not be permitted. And yet what is done must be done
quickly; for population will not wait, and commerce will not cast
anchor, and manufactures will not shut off the steam, nor shut down the
gate, and agriculture, pushed by millions of freemen on their fertile
soil, will not withhold her corrupting abundance.</p>
<p>And let no man at the East quiet himself, and dream of liberty,
whatever may become of the West. Our alliance of blood, and political
institutions, and common interests, is such, that we can not stand aloof
in the hour of her calamity, should it ever come. Her destiny is our
destiny; and the day that her gallant ship goes down, our little boat
sinks in the vortex!</p>
<p>The great experiment is now making, and from its extent and rapid
filling up, is making in the West, whether the perpetuity of our
republican institutions can be reconciled with universal suffrage.
Without the education of the head and heart of the nation, they can not
be; and the question to be decided is, can the nation, or the vast
balance power of it, be so imbued with intelligence and virtue as to
bring out, in laws and their administration, a perpetual self-preserving
energy. We know that the work is a vast one, and of great difficulty;
and yet we believe it can be done.</p>
<p>I am aware that our ablest patriots are looking out on the deep,
vexed with storms, with great forebodings and failings of heart, for
fear of the things that are coming upon us; and I perceive a spirit of
impatience rising, and distrust in respect to the perpetuity of our
republic; and I am sure that these fears are well founded, and am glad
that they exist. It is the star of hope in our dark horizon. Fear is
what we need, as the ship needs wind on a rocking sea, after a storm, to
prevent foundering. But when our fear and our efforts shall correspond
with our danger, the danger is past.</p>
<p>For it is not the impossibility of self-preservation which threatens
us; nor is it the unwillingness of the nation to pay the price of the
preservation, as she has paid the price of the purchase of our
liberties. It is inattention and inconsideration, protracted till the
crisis is past, and the things which belong to our peace are hid from
our eyes. And blessed be God, that the tokens of a national waking up,
the harbinger of God’s mercy, are multiplying upon us!</p>
<p>We did not, in the darkest hour, believe that God had brought our
fathers to this goodly land to lay the foundation of religious liberty,
and wrought such wonders in their preservation, and raised their
descendants to such heights of civil and religious liberty, only to
reverse the analogy of his providence, and abandon his work.</p>
<p>And though there now be clouds, and the sea roaring, and men’s hearts
failing, we believe there is light behind the cloud, and that the
imminence of our danger is intended, under the guidance of Heaven, to
call forth and apply a holy, fraternal fellowship between the East and
the West, which shall secure our preservation, and make the prosperity
of our nation durable as time, and as abundant as the waves of the
sea.</p>
<p>I would add, as a motive to immediate action, that if we do fail in
our great experiment of self-government, our destruction will be as
signal as the birthright abandoned, the mercies abused, and the
provocation offered to beneficent Heaven. The descent of desolation will
correspond with the past elevation.</p>
<p>No punishments of Heaven are so severe as those for mercies abused;
and no instrumentality employed in their infliction is so dreadful as
the wrath of man. No spasms are like the spasms of expiring liberty, and
no wailing such as her convulsions extort.</p>
<p>It took Rome three hundred years to die; and our death, if we perish,
will be as much more terrific as our intelligence and free institutions
have given us more bone, sinew, and vitality. May God hide from me the
day when the dying agonies of my country shall begin! O thou beloved
land, bound together by the ties of brotherhood, and common interest,
and perils! live forever—one and undivided!</p>

<p>我们必须发展教育！我们必须重视教育！若不然，日益繁荣的经济将成为我们的坟墓。如果我们不广施教育，那么我们整个民族从摇篮到坟墓不过在转瞬之间。如果一味朝着国富民强的目标急追猛赶的时候，自由和宗教方面的教育没有同步跟上，那么他们将永远无法赶上经济发展的脚步；或者，教育只会在自由之战打响并惨败之后才出现，到那时，教育就成了点缀胜利的战利品，沦为专制之源，让我们永世不得翻身。</p>
<p>但是如果经济发展一日千里，势不可当，而对于培养思想、情操、灵魂而言必不可少的教育制度的建设却停滞不前，那么西部的将来会变成什么样子？绝对不能允许这种情况发生。但是，采取行动已刻不容缓；因为人口的增长不可能停止，商业发展不会就此搁浅，制造业不会关掉蒸汽阀，或者关门大吉，而在肥沃的土地上被数以百万的自由农民推动的农业，也不会因为谷仓里的谷物多得快要腐烂而抑制生产。</p>
<p>东方世界的人们请不要安闲自得，请憧憬一下自由，想一想是什么成就了现在的西方世界。我们的血缘，我们的政治建构，我们的共同利益是如此一脉相承，如果灾难降临，我们不会袖手旁观。她与我们休戚与共；如果有一天，她那艘宏伟巨轮倾覆的话，那我们这叶小舟也将淹没在她的漩涡之中。</p>
<p>西方世界正以破竹之势进行着一场伟大的实验，即共和制与普选权能否长期共存。如果没有教育来教化国民的灵魂与精神，那么他们就不可能成为捍卫自由的中流砥柱。有待解决的一个问题是，这个国家——或称之为各方制衡的巨大力量，能不能具备足够的智慧与优势，在其法律和治理体制中体现出一种持久的自我保存的能力。我们知道这是一项艰苦卓绝的任务，但我们坚信我们定会成功。</p>
<p>我知道有许多仁人志士正站在峭壁上望着脚下的深渊，疾风骤雨让他们心绪不宁，他们有种不好的预感，担心灾难会降临到我们身上。我察觉到焦躁的情绪正在滋长，对共和制度能否永存的质疑正在扩散。我确信这些担心恐惧都事出有因。我很高兴他们存在着。这是在漆黑的地平线上升起的希望之星。我们需要恐惧，就像漂浮在暴风雨过后大海上的小船，只要有风就不会沉没一样。当我们以恐惧与努力应对我们的危险时，其实危险已然过去。</p>
<p>构成威胁的并不是我们不能实现自我保存，也不是这个国家不肯为之付出代价，因为在争取自由的时候，他已经尽力而为了。威胁我们的是直到危机过后仍在延续的、对于自我保存重要性的漠视，以及看不见什么能为我们带来和平的被蒙蔽的双眼。蒙上帝佑护，民族觉醒和上帝慈悲的预兆，已接二连三地降临在我们身上。</p>
<p>上帝带领着我们的父辈来到这片辽阔的大地，将宗教信仰自由的基石深深埋入这片土壤，他创造了无数奇迹，让父辈在恶劣的环境下代代存续，指引着他们的后代向民权和宗教自由的高峰迈进，即便是在最痛苦最黑暗的时刻，我们都不会相信上帝这样做只是为了将他赐予的一切全部收回，将他创建的一切全部抛弃。</p>
<p>尽管眼下乌云密布，大海咆哮，人民心绪低落，但我们坚信，阳光就在云层背后，而日渐迫近的险境是冥冥之中上帝的安排，他召唤着大海两岸的人民永远铭记上天赐予的兄弟情谊，这将是我们得以存续的保证，是国家世代繁荣昌盛、如同海水般永不枯竭的保证。</p>
<p>为了促进我们尽快采取行动，我还要补充一点，如果这场自治的伟大尝试失败了，那我们面临的灾难无异于丢弃了我们与生俱来的权利，亵渎了上帝的慈悲，向仁慈的上帝发出了挑衅。我们曾经攀登得多高，当下就会跌落得多惨。</p>
<p>上天的惩罚中，再也没有什么比亵渎慈悲所受的惩罚更严厉；而所有惩戒手段中，亦再也没有什么比人类的愤怒更可怕。世上所有的苦难中，再也没有比失去自由更让人痛不欲生，而所有的悲痛中，亦再也没有比失去自由之后的恸哭更凄惨绝望。</p>
<p>罗马缠绵病榻三百年才咽下最后一口气；我们的死，如果真有那么一天的话，肯定比罗马来得壮烈，因为我们的智慧和自由的制度给了我们更健壮的骨骼，更强韧的肌腱，更蓬勃的生命力。如果有一天，我的祖国要经受临死前的折磨，愿上帝别让我活到那一天！啊，我亲爱的祖国，愿兄弟手足之爱将我们紧紧团结在一起，同甘共苦，祸福与共！永垂不朽——不可分割的统一的祖国！</p>

<p>RIDING ON A SNOWPLOW</p>
<p>乘坐扫雪机</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin Taylor, 1822-1887, was born at Lowville, New York,
and graduated at Madison University, of which his father was president.
Here he remained as resident graduate for about five years. His
“Attractions of Language” was published in 1845. For many years
Mr. Taylor was literary editor of the “Chicago Journal.” He wrote
considerably for the magazines, and was the author of many well-known
fugitive pieces, both in prose and verse. He also published several
books, of which “January and June,” “Pictures in Camp and Field,” “The
World on Wheels,” “Old-time Pictures and Sheaves of Rhyme,” “Between the
Gates,” and “Songs of Yesterday,” are the best known. In his later
years, Mr. Taylor achieved some reputation as a lecturer. His writings
are marked by an exuberant fancy.</p>
<p>Did you ever ride on a snowplow? Not the pet and pony of a thing that
is attached to the front of an engine, sometimes, like a pilot; but a
great two-storied monster of strong timbers, that runs upon wheels of
its own, and that boys run after and stare at as they would after and at
an elephant. You are snow-bound at Buffalo. The Lake Shore Line is piled
with drifts like a surf. Two passenger trains have been half-buried for
twelve hours somewhere in snowy Chautauqua. The storm howls like a
congregation of Arctic bears. But the superintendent at Buffalo is
determined to release his castaways, and clear the road to Erie. He
permits you to be a passenger on the great snowplow; and there it is,
all ready to drive. Harnessed behind it, is a tandem team of three
engines. It does not occur to you that you are going to ride on a steam
drill, and so you get aboard.</p>
<p>It is a spacious and timbered room, with one large bull’s eye
window,—an overgrown lens. The thing is a sort of Cyclops. There are
ropes, and chains, and a windlass. There is a bell by which the engineer
of the first engine can signal the plowman, and a cord whereby the
plowman can talk back. There are two sweeps, or arms, worked by
machinery, on the sides. You ask their use, and the superintendent
replies, “When, in a violent shock, there is danger of the monster’s
upsetting, an arm is put out, on one side or the other, to keep the
thing from turning a complete somersault.” You get one idea, and an
inkling of another. So you take out your Accident Policy for three
thousand dollars, and examine it. It never mentions battles, nor duels,
nor snowplows. It names “public conveyances.” Is a snowplow a public
conveyance? You are inclined to think it is neither that nor any other
kind that you should trust yourself to, but it is too late for
consideration.</p>
<p>You roll out of Buffalo in the teeth of the wind, and the world is
turned to snow. All goes merrily. The machine strikes little drifts, and
they scurry away in a cloud. The three engines breathe easily; but by
and by the earth seems broken into great billows of dazzling white. The
sun comes out of a cloud, and touches it up till it out-silvers Potosi.
Houses lie in the trough of the sea everywhere, and it requires little
imagination to think they are pitching and tossing before your eyes. A
great breaker rises right in the way. The monster, with you in it, works
its way up and feels of it. It is packed like a ledge of marble. Three
whistles! The machine backs away and keeps backing, as a gymnast runs
astern to get sea room and momentum for a big jump; as a giant swings
aloft a heavy sledge, that it may come down with a heavy blow.</p>
<p>One whistle! You have come to a halt. Three pairs of whistles one
after the other! and then, putting on all steam, you make for the drift.
The superintendent locks the door, you do not quite understand why, and
in a second the battle begins. The machine rocks and creaks in all its
joints. There comes a tremendous shock. The cabin is as dark as
midnight. The clouds of flying snow put out the day. The labored
breathing of the locomotives behind you, the clouds of smoke and steam
that wrap you up as in a mantle, the noonday eclipse of the sun, the
surging of the ship, the rattling of chains, the creak of timbers as if
the craft were aground and the sea getting out of its bed to whelm you
altogether, the doubt as to what will come,—all combine to make a scene
of strange excitement for a landlubber.</p>
<p>You have made some impression on the breaker, and again the machine
backs for a fair start, and then another plunge, and shock, and
twilight. And so, from deep cut to deep cut, as if the season had packed
all his winter clothes upon the track, until the stalled trains are
reached and passed; and then, with alternate storm and calm, and halt
and shock, till the way is cleared to Erie.</p>
<p>It is Sunday afternoon, and Erie—“Mad Anthony Wayne’s” old
headquarters—has donned its Sunday clothes, and turned out by hundreds
to see the great plow come in,—its first voyage over the line. The
locomotives set up a crazy scream, and you draw slowly into the depot.
The door opened at last, you clamber down, and gaze up at the uneasy
house in which you have been living. It looks as if an avalanche had
tumbled down upon it,—white as an Alpine shoulder. Your first thought is
gratitude that you have made a landing alive. Your second, a resolution
that, if again you ride a hammer, it will not be when three engines have
hold of the handle!</p>

<p>你有没有坐过扫雪机？不是那种小狗、小马驹之类的后面拖个马达，像是他们在前面充当领航员那样的小玩意儿；而是那种有两层楼那么高的木梁结构的庞然大物，底下装着四个驱动轮，男孩子们每次见到它都会跟在后面边跑边看，稀奇得就像在追看一头大象。你现在正在大雪封门的水牛城。积雪堆积的湖岸线就像是一排拍岸的海浪。两列客车被半埋在肖托夸的雪地里已有十二个小时。风暴狂啸如同一群北极熊在齐声吼叫。水牛城的负责人还是决定要让那些受困的人尽早脱身，清理出一条通往伊利湖的通道。他答应让你乘上那辆巨大的扫雪机；现在，它就在那里待命，一切已准备就绪。它的驱动装置设在后部，由一组串联的发动机组成。你不会想到你正要坐上的是一个蒸汽钻头，而后你上了车。</p>
<p>这是一个宽敞的木质房间，有一个大牛眼一样的窗户——一个凸透镜。扫雪机看上去多少就像是个独眼巨人。车上面还有粗绳，锁链和绞盘。操控第一发动机的机械师通过一只铃铛来给驾驶扫雪机的农夫传递信号，农夫则用另一根绳索来回话。车厢两边各有一个把手，或叫臂杆，由机械装置来操控，当你问起它们的作用时，负责人回答说：“当扫雪机遭到攻击时，这个大块头会有翻车的危险，这时，一侧的臂杆就会将车身撑住以避免扫雪机翻筋斗。”听完后，你冒出另一个模糊的想法。于是你掏出保额为三千美金的意外险保单仔细查看。条款中没有涉及战争，也没有决斗或扫雪机等字眼。它只提到了“公共运输”。那扫雪机算不算公共运输工具呢？你会觉得它既不“公共”，也算不上“交通工具”，可是你已经没有时间细想了。</p>
<p>你冒着狂风开出水牛城，大雪似乎覆盖了整个世界。周围一切变得充满了趣味。大机器撞到了一个小雪堆，撞散的积雪旋转着在空中卷起了一团云雾。三台发动机运转情况不错，跑起来颇为轻松自如；不过不久我们就像是闯入了耀眼的白色巨浪中。太阳钻出了云层，阳光将扫雪机映照得通体闪亮，就像是从波托西大银矿里开采出来的物件一样。房屋散落在雪海的低凹处，你只要稍加想象，就会觉得它们在白浪里颠簸摇晃。一个巨大的浪头般的雪团横亘在半路上。载着你的大怪物在行经路线中感到了它的存在。整个隆起物结实得像是大理石暗礁。耳边响起了三声汽笛！大家伙开始不住往后退，像是一个向后跑的体操运动员，想要获得自由助跑空间以便积蓄纵身一跃的冲力；又像是一把向上摆动的巨大的铁锤，眼见着就要砸落那千钧一击。</p>
<p>又是一声汽笛响！你停了下来。三组汽笛声此起彼伏！接着，所有蒸汽动力全部启动，你开始向那个大雪团进军。负责人锁上了门，你并不知道他为什么这么做，而顷刻间，战斗打响。机器开始摇晃，所有的接合处都在咯咯作响。然后来了一下剧烈撞击。车厢内如同深夜一般漆黑一片。击碎的飞雪遮天盖日。你身后的三台发动机扑哧扑哧喘着粗气，蒸汽、烟雾像一席巨大的帐幔将你整个包裹其中，正午的太阳因此黯然失色，船体的冲击，锁链的摩擦声，木材的嘎吱嘎吱，就像是船只搁浅岸上，海水正从海床底下翻涌而上要把你连同那个大家伙一口吞噬，而对于之后会发生什么，你惶然不知所措——所有这一切交织在一起，让不识水性的旱鸭子感到了一种异样、莫名的兴奋。</p>
<p>你看着那个被撼动的雪团，机器再度后退准备再接再厉，然后又是一次猛烈摇晃，又是一次剧烈撞击，又是一次昏天暗地。就这样，一下又一下深入挖掘，仿佛这个季节给铁轨穿上了所有的冬衣，直到最后到达了受困列车的位置，而后大家伙继续向前，时而平静，时而发飙，时而停止，时而撞击，就这样直到伊利湖的道路全线贯通。</p>
<p>这是一个周日的午后，伊利市——曾是安东尼·韦恩指挥部的旧址——已经换上了夏装，数以百计的人倾巢而出，围观这个巨大的扫雪机首次越线航行。发动机组发出了一声刺耳的尖叫，然后你慢慢地驶进了车库。门终于打开了，你爬下车，然后回头凝望你刚才呆过的那栋令人不安的座舱。它看上去就像是刚遭遇了雪崩——通体雪白，就像是阿尔卑斯山的山峰。你第一个念头就是庆幸自己能活着落地。而你的第二个念头就是，倘若你还会再次坐上一把大锤子，那可绝不会是三台发动机抓住锤柄的时候！</p>

<p>THE QUARREL OF BRUTUS AND CASSIUS</p>
<p>布鲁特斯和卡西乌斯的争执</p>
<p>Cas . That you have wronged me doth appear in this:</p>
<p>You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella</p>
<p>For taking bribes here of the Sardians;</p>
<p>Wherein my letters, praying on his side,</p>
<p>Because I knew the man, were slighted off.</p>
<p>Bru . You wronged yourself to write in such a case.</p>
<p>Cas . In such a time as this, it is not meet</p>
<p>That every nice offense should bear his comment.</p>
<p>Bru . Yet let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself</p>
<p>Are much condemned to have an itching palm,</p>
<p>To sell and mart your offices for gold</p>
<p>To undeservers.</p>
<p>Cas . I an itching palm!</p>
<p>You know that you are Brutus that speak this,</p>
<p>Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.</p>
<p>Bru . The name of Cassius honors this corruption,</p>
<p>And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.</p>
<p>Cas . Chastisement!</p>
<p>Bru . Remember March, the ides of March remember!</p>
<p>Did not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?</p>
<p>What villain touched his body, that did stab,</p>
<p>And not for justice? What! shall one of us,</p>
<p>That struck the foremost man of all this world</p>
<p>But for supporting robbers; shall we now</p>
<p>Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,</p>
<p>And sell the mighty space of our large honors</p>
<p>For so much trash as may be graspe’d thus?</p>
<p>I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,</p>
<p>Than such a Roman.</p>
<p>Cas . Brutus, bay not me;</p>
<p>I’ll not endure it: you forget yourself,</p>
<p>To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,</p>
<p>Older in practice, abler than yourself</p>
<p>To make conditions.</p>
<p>Bru . Go to; you are not, Cassius.</p>
<p>Cas . I am.</p>
<p>Bru . I say you are not.</p>
<p>Cas . Urge me no more, I shall forget myself:</p>
<p>Have mind upon your health; tempt me no further.</p>
<p>Bru . Away, slight man!</p>
<p>Cas . Is’t possible?</p>
<p>Bru . Hear me, for I will speak.</p>
<p>Must I give way and room to your rash choler?</p>
<p>Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?</p>
<p>Cas . O ye gods! ye gods! must I endure all this?</p>
<p>Bru . All this! Ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;</p>
<p>Go, show your slaves how choleric you are,</p>
<p>And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?</p>
<p>Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch</p>
<p>Under your testy humor? By the gods,</p>
<p>You shall digest the venom of your spleen,</p>
<p>Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,</p>
<p>I’ll use you for my mirth, yea for my laughter,</p>
<p>When you are waspish.</p>
<p>Cas . Is it come to this?</p>
<p>Bru . You say you are a better soldier;</p>
<p>Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,</p>
<p>And it shall please me well: for mine own part,</p>
<p>I shall be glad to learn of noble men.</p>
<p>Cas . You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;</p>
<p>I said, an elder soldier, not a better:</p>
<p>Did I say “better”?</p>
<p>Bru . If you did, I care not.</p>
<p>Cas . When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.</p>
<p>Bru . Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.</p>
<p>Cas . I durst not?</p>
<p>Bru . No.</p>
<p>Cas . What! durst not tempt him?</p>
<p>Bru . For your life, you durst not.</p>
<p>Cas . Do not presume too much upon my love;</p>
<p>I may do that I shall be sorry for.</p>
<p>Bru . You have done that you should be sorry for.</p>
<p>There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;</p>
<p>For I am armed so strong in honesty</p>
<p>That they pass by me as the idle wind,</p>
<p>Which I respect not. I did send to you</p>
<p>For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;—</p>
<p>For I can raise no money by vile means:</p>
<p>By heaven! I had rather coin my heart,</p>
<p>And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring</p>
<p>From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash</p>
<p>By any indirection.—I did send</p>
<p>To you for gold to pay my legions,</p>
<p>Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?</p>
<p>Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?</p>
<p>When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,</p>
<p>To lock such rascal counters from his friends,</p>
<p>Be ready, gods, with an your thunderbolts;</p>
<p>Dash him to pieces!</p>
<p>Cas . I denied you not.</p>
<p>Bru . You did.</p>
<p>Cas . I did not: he was but a fool that brought</p>
<p>My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:</p>
<p>A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities,</p>
<p>But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</p>
<p>Bru . I do not, till you practice them on me.</p>
<p>Cas . You love me not.</p>
<p>Bru . I do not like your faults.</p>
<p>Cas . A friendly eye could never see such faults.</p>
<p>Bru . A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear</p>
<p>As huge as high Olympus.</p>
<p>Cas . Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,</p>
<p>Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,</p>
<p>For Cassius is aweary of the world;</p>
<p>Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;</p>
<p>Checked like a bondman; all his faults observed,</p>
<p>Set in a notebook, learned, and conned by rate,</p>
<p>To cast into my teeth. Oh, I could weep</p>
<p>My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,</p>
<p>And here my naked breast; within, a heart</p>
<p>Dearer than Plutus’ mine, richer than gold:</p>
<p>If that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth:</p>
<p>I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:</p>
<p>Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,</p>
<p>When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better</p>
<p>Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</p>
<p>Bru . Sheathe your dagger:</p>
<p>Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;</p>
<p>Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.</p>
<p>O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb</p>
<p>That carries anger as the flint bears fire;</p>
<p>Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,</p>
<p>And straight is cold again.</p>
<p>Cas . Hath Cassius lived</p>
<p>To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,</p>
<p>When grief, and blood ill-tempered, vexeth him?</p>
<p>Bru . When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered, too.</p>
<p>Cas . Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</p>
<p>Bru . And my heart, too.</p>
<p>Cas . O Brutus!</p>
<p>Bru . What’s the matter?</p>
<p>Cas . Have you not love enough to bear with me,</p>
<p>When that rash humor which my mother gave me</p>
<p>Makes me forgetful?</p>
<p>Bru . Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,</p>
<p>When you are over earnest with your Brutus,</p>
<p>He’ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.</p>

<p>卡西乌斯 这件事你可是做得对不起我：</p>
<p>卢修斯·佩拉接受了撒丁尼亚人的贿赂；</p>
<p>你因此羞辱了他并治了他的罪；</p>
<p>我跟他认识，所以写信替他说情，</p>
<p>你却置之不理。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 为了这种事你替他说情，你对不起你自己。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 都现在这种时候了，</p>
<p>不用为每件小事都大动干戈吧。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 那让我告诉你，卡西乌斯，</p>
<p>你也不是什么好东西，见钱眼开，</p>
<p>为了钱居然把官职卖给</p>
<p>完全不能胜任的家伙。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 我见钱眼开！</p>
<p>说这话的若不是你布鲁特斯，</p>
<p>老天作证，我保证让这句话成为你的临终遗言。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 你的名头庇护了这种腐败行径，</p>
<p>所有的刑罚形同虚设。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 刑罚！</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 记住三月，记住三月十五日 (1) ！</p>
<p>伟大的尤里乌斯不就是为了公理血溅当场了吗？</p>
<p>那些刺杀他的人当中，又有哪个不是为了公理</p>
<p>而痛下杀手？什么！我们扳倒了</p>
<p>傲视天下的英雄，</p>
<p>不过是因为他扶持暴民；而我们现在</p>
<p>却要染指这肮脏的贿赂，</p>
<p>为了粪土一般的金钱，</p>
<p>出卖我们伟大的尊严，</p>
<p>我宁可做一条对着月亮狂吠的狗，</p>
<p>也不愿做这样一个罗马人。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 布鲁特斯，别冲着我乱叫；</p>
<p>我可不会忍气吞声：你别忘了自己姓啥名谁，</p>
<p>居然敢在我面前这么放肆；我是一个军人，我，</p>
<p>比你有经验，在处理这种事上</p>
<p>你不如我聪明。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 胡说；你才不是呢，卡西乌斯。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 我就是。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 我说你不是。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 别再逼我，冲动起来，我可谁也不认：</p>
<p>想想你的人身安全，别再继续刺激我。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 滚开，你这个小人！</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 你说什么？</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 听好了，我这就要一吐为快。</p>
<p>你一发怒，我就要退缩吗？</p>
<p>一个疯子两眼一瞪，我就得害怕吗？</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 哦，天神！天神！我必须忍受这一切吗？</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 一切？还远不止呢：发怒吧，直到你那颗骄傲的心气炸；</p>
<p>继续呀，让你的奴才们好好见识一下你的脾气，</p>
<p>让他们怕得浑身发抖。你在气头上，我就非得避让吗？</p>
<p>我就非得看你的脸色行事吗？我就非得站在这里，</p>
<p>向你的暴烈脾气低头吗？天神在上，</p>
<p>就算你真气炸了肚皮，也请自个儿慢慢享用</p>
<p>从脾脏里流出来的毒液，因为从今天起，</p>
<p>只要你一发火，我就把你当成笑柄，</p>
<p>寻你开心。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 你至于这样吗？</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 你说作为军人，你比我优秀；</p>
<p>就算是这样；请用事实来证明，</p>
<p>这会让我心服口服：至于我，</p>
<p>我很高兴能向优秀的人学习。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 你从头到尾都错怪我了；你错怪我了，布鲁特斯；</p>
<p>我是说，更有经验的军人，不是更优秀：</p>
<p>我说“更优秀”了吗？</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 就算你说了，我也不会在乎。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 凯撒在世的时候，他可不敢这么激怒我。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 算了吧，算了吧！你也不敢这么招惹他。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 我不敢？</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 对，你不敢。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 什么！不敢招惹他？</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 打死你也不敢。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 你别高估我对你的友情；</p>
<p>别逼我做出什么让我后悔的事来。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 你已经做了让你后悔的事了。</p>
<p>你的恐吓，卡西乌斯，吓不了人。</p>
<p>我有如此强大的正义庇护左右，</p>
<p>你的恐吓不过就像是吹过一股懒洋洋的风，</p>
<p>能奈我何？我曾派人给你送来</p>
<p>一笔钱财，不过你拒绝收下——</p>
<p>因为我不能用卑劣的手段敛财。</p>
<p>苍天在上！我宁可拿我的心脏来铸币，</p>
<p>滴我的鲜血做银钱，也不愿</p>
<p>坑蒙拐骗，从农民粗糙干裂的手中</p>
<p>搜刮那一星半点臭烘烘的血汗钱。我曾经派人</p>
<p>向你借款以发放军饷，</p>
<p>可被你一口回绝，凯撒会这么做吗？</p>
<p>我会这样对待凯厄斯·卡西乌斯吗？</p>
<p>如果有一天，我马库斯·布鲁特斯变得如此贪得无厌，</p>
<p>把臭钱全锁起来，不让他的朋友们沾手，</p>
<p>那么，天神，请准备好，用你的万钧雷霆</p>
<p>把他击成碎片吧！</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 我没有回绝过你。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 你有。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 我没有。那个替我传话的家伙</p>
<p>一准是个笨蛋。布鲁特斯，你伤了我的心：</p>
<p>朋友之间应该包容对方的缺点，</p>
<p>可布鲁特斯却将我的缺点无限放大。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 那是因为你把所有的缺点在我身上操练了个遍。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 你没拿我当朋友。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 我不喜欢你身上的毛病。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 一双友善的眼睛可看不到这样的毛病。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 这样的眼睛只有阿谀奉承的人才有，哪怕那缺点</p>
<p>大得就跟奥林帕斯山一样。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 来吧，安东尼，还有年轻的奥克塔维厄斯，都来吧，</p>
<p>来向卡西乌斯复仇吧，</p>
<p>因为卡西乌斯已厌倦活在这世上，</p>
<p>被他所爱的人憎恨着，被他的手足践踏着，</p>
<p>像一个奴隶一样遭人训斥，身上所有的毛病被看得一清二楚，</p>
<p>被记录在案，被仔细调查，被反复默念，</p>
<p>然后当着我的面细数我的罪状。啊，我哭得</p>
<p>灵魂都快随眼泪一同流光了！那里有我的匕首，</p>
<p>这是我裸露的胸膛，里面的一颗心</p>
<p>比普罗托斯的宝藏还要值钱，比金子还要昂贵：</p>
<p>如果你还是个罗马人，就把这颗心掏去吧。</p>
<p>我曾经拒绝你的金钱，现在我把我的心给你：</p>
<p>刺吧，就像刺死凯撒一样；因为我知道，</p>
<p>就算在你最痛恨凯撒的时候，对他的爱也远胜过</p>
<p>对卡西乌斯的爱。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 收起你的匕首：</p>
<p>有火尽管发，但要适可而止；</p>
<p>你可以率性而为，言行不当只当是一时之气。</p>

<p>卡西乌斯 卡西乌斯活着</p>
<p>难不成就是为了在他痛苦激愤的时候，</p>
<p>供布鲁特斯逗乐取笑吗？</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 我在说这话的时候，心里也不好过。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 你这算是在向我认错吗？把你的手给我。</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 还有我的心。</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 啊，布鲁特斯！</p>
<p>布鲁特斯 怎么啦？</p>
<p>卡西乌斯 我的母亲给了我这副暴脾气，</p>
<p>有时我会控制不了自己，</p>
<p>难道咱们之间的友情还不够深，</p>
<p>不足以让你宽待包容吗？</p>

<p>SCENE—The Inn . Enter HOSTESS followed by LAMPEDO, a Quack Doctor
.</p>
<p>Host . Nay, nay; another fortnight.</p>
<p>Lamp . It can’t be.</p>
<p>The man’s as well as I am: have some mercy!</p>
<p>He hath been here almost three weeks already.</p>
<p>Host . Well, then, a week.</p>
<p>Lamp . We may detain him a week. (Enter BALTHAZAR, the patient, from
behind, in his nightgown, with a drawn sword .)</p>
<p>You talk now like a reasonable hostess,</p>
<p>That sometimes has a reckoning with her conscience.</p>
<p>Host . He still believes he has an inward bruise.</p>
<p>Lamp . I would to heaven he had! or that he’d slipped</p>
<p>His shoulder blade, or broke a leg or two,</p>
<p>(Not that I bear his person any malice,)</p>
<p>Or luxed an arm, or even sprained his ankle!</p>
<p>Host . Ay, broken anything except his neck.</p>
<p>Lamp . However, for a week I’ll manage him,</p>
<p>Though he had the constitution of a horse—</p>
<p>A farrier should prescribe for him.</p>
<p>Balth . A farrier! (Aside .)</p>
<p>Lamp . To-morrow, we phlebotomize again;</p>
<p>Next day, my new-invented patent draught;</p>
<p>Then, I have some pills prepared;</p>
<p>On Thursday, we throw in the bark; on Friday—</p>
<p>Balth . (Coming forward .) Well, sir, on Friday—what, on Friday?
Come,</p>
<p>Proceed.</p>
<p>Lamp . Discovered!</p>
<p>Balth . On your knees? ’T is well!</p>
<p>Pray! for your time is short.</p>
<p>Host . Nay, do not kill us.</p>
<p>Balth . You have been tried, condemned, and only wait</p>
<p>For execution. Which shall I begin with?</p>
<p>Lamp . The lady, by all means, sir.</p>
<p>Balth . Come, prepare. (To the hostess .)</p>
<p>Host . Have pity by the weakness of my sex!</p>
<p>Balth . Tell me, thou quaking mountain of gross flesh,</p>
<p>Tell me, and in a breath, how many poisons—</p>
<p>If you attempt it—(To LAMPEDO, who is making off )</p>
<p>you have cooked up for me?</p>
<p>Host . None, as I hope for mercy!</p>
<p>Balth . Is not thy wine a poison?</p>
<p>Host . No indeed, sir;</p>
<p>’T is not, I own, of the first quality;</p>
<p>But—</p>
<p>Balth . What?</p>
<p>Host . I always give short measure, sir,</p>
<p>And ease my conscience that way.</p>
<p>Balth . Ease your conscience!</p>
<p>I’ll ease your conscience for you.</p>
<p>Host . Mercy, sir!</p>
<p>Balth . Rise, if thou canst, and hear me.</p>
<p>Host . Your commands, sir?</p>
<p>Balth . If, in five minutes, all things are prepared</p>
<p>For my departure, you may yet survive.</p>
<p>Host . It shall be done in less.</p>
<p>Balth . Away, thou lumpfish. (Exit hostess.)</p>
<p>Lamp . So! now comes my turn! ’t is all over with me!</p>
<p>There’s dagger, rope, and ratsbane in his looks!</p>
<p>Balth . And now, thou sketch and outline of a man!</p>
<p>Thou thing that hast no shadow in the sun!</p>
<p>Thou eel in a consumption, eldest born</p>
<p>Of Death and Famine! thou anatomy</p>
<p>Of a starved pilchard!</p>
<p>Lamp . I do confess my leanness. I am spare,</p>
<p>And, therefore, spare me.</p>
<p>Balth . Why wouldst thou have made me</p>
<p>A thoroughfare, for thy whole shop to pass through?</p>
<p>Lamp . Man, you know, must live.</p>
<p>Balth . Yes: he must die, too.</p>
<p>Lamp . For my patients’ sake!</p>
<p>Balth . I’ll send you to the major part of them—</p>
<p>The window, sir, is open; -come, prepare.</p>
<p>Lamp . Pray consider!</p>
<p>I may hurt some one in the street.</p>
<p>Balth . Why, then,</p>
<p>I’ll rattle thee to pieces in a dicebox,</p>
<p>Or grind thee in a coffee mill to powder,</p>
<p>For thou must sup with Pluto:—so, make ready!</p>
<p>Whilst I, with this good smallsword for a lancet,</p>
<p>Let thy starved spirit out (for blood thou hast none),</p>
<p>And nail thee to the wall, where thou shalt look</p>
<p>Like a dried beetle with a pin stuck through him.</p>
<p>Lamp . Consider my poor wife.</p>
<p>Balth . Thy wife!</p>
<p>Lamp . My wife, sir.</p>
<p>Balth . Hast thou dared think of matrimony, too?</p>
<p>Thou shadow of a man, and base as lean!</p>
<p>Lamp . O spare me for her sake!</p>
<p>I have a wife, and three angelic babes,</p>
<p>Who, by those looks, are well nigh fatherless.</p>
<p>Balth . Well, well! your wife and children shall plead for you.</p>
<p>Come, come; the pills! where are the pills? Produce them.</p>
<p>Lamp . Here is the box.</p>
<p>Balth . Were it Pandora’s, and each single pill</p>
<p>Had ten diseases in it, you should take them.</p>
<p>Lamp . What, all?</p>
<p>Balth . Ay, all; and quickly, too. Come, sir, begin—</p>
<p>(LAMPEDO takes one .) That’s well! —Another.</p>
<p>Lamp . One’s a dose.</p>
<p>Balth . Proceed, sir.</p>
<p>Lamp . What will become of me?</p>
<p>Let me go home, and set my shop to rights,</p>
<p>And, like immortal Caesar, die with decency.</p>
<p>Balth . Away! and thank thy lucky star I have not</p>
<p>Brayed thee in thine own mortar, or exposed thee</p>
<p>For a large specimen of the lizard genus.</p>
<p>Lamp . Would I were one! —for they can feed on air.</p>
<p>Balth . Home, sir! and be more honest.</p>
<p>Lamp . If I am not,</p>
<p>I’ll be more wise, at least.</p>

<p>幕启——小旅馆。兰佩多，一位江湖庸医跟在女老板身后上场。</p>
<p>老板娘 不，不；还得让他多呆两个礼拜。</p>
<p>兰佩多
那可不行。不管是他还是我，就请您行行好吧！他都已经在这儿呆了三个礼拜了。</p>
<p>老板娘 好吧，那就一个礼拜。</p>
<p>兰佩多
我们大概还能把他留一个礼拜。（病人巴尔萨扎从后面上场，他穿着睡衣，手里拿着一把拔出鞘的刀。）现在您听上去像是个通情达理的老板娘了，人说话有时得凭良心啊。</p>
<p>老板娘 他还是觉得自己有内伤。</p>
<p>兰佩多
他要是有内伤，那我就去见上帝！我但愿他肩膀被刀口划了一下，要不就是折了一两条腿（我说这话可不是存心咒他），再不就是手臂脱臼，或是扭了脚踝。</p>
<p>老板娘 唉，只要不是扭断脖子怎么着都行。</p>
<p>兰佩多
不过，一个礼拜我还能对付，虽然他壮得像匹马——按理说应该让兽医来给他开药方。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 兽医！（站在一侧）</p>
<p>兰佩多
明天，我们再抽一次血；后天，服用我新研制的口服液；我还准备了一些药片；礼拜四，再搁点金鸡纳树皮进去；礼拜五的话——</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨
（走上前）好吧，先生，礼拜五——礼拜五怎么样？来，往下说呗。</p>
<p>兰佩多 糟糕，露馅了！</p>
<p>他们（老板娘，兰佩多）跪了下来。</p>
<p>女老板 求您开恩哪，大人！</p>
<p>兰佩多 求您放过我们吧。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 靠下跪就想让我放过你们？很好！祷告吧！你们的时间不多了。</p>
<p>老板娘 不，求您别杀我们。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 你们已经被判刑了，死刑，就等着行刑吧。该拿谁先开刀呢？</p>
<p>兰佩多 当然是女士优先了，先生。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 好吧，准备好。（转向老板娘。）</p>
<p>老板娘 看在我是个女流之辈的份上，求您可怜可怜我吧。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨
告诉我，你这个浑身发抖的肥婆娘，快点告诉我，如果你们投毒的话——准备放多少毒药——（转向正要溜走的兰佩多）你到底炮制了多少毒药？</p>
<p>老板娘 哪敢呢，求您饶了我！</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 你这酒里没毒吧？</p>
<p>老板娘 没有没有，先生；保证酒里没毒，我这可是最好的酒；只不过——</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 什么？</p>
<p>老板娘
我打酒的时候一直缺斤短两来着，先生，说出来我良心能好过一点。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 良心好过些！我会让你的良心好过些的。</p>
<p>老板娘 放过我吧，先生。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 起来吧，如果还站得起来的话，听我说。</p>
<p>老板娘 您有什么吩咐，先生？</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨
如果五分钟内，你能把一切打点妥当让我离开的话，你就能留住这条命。</p>
<p>老板娘 我保证五分钟不到我就给您准备好。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 滚吧，你这个丑陋的肥婆娘。（老板娘退场）</p>
<p>兰佩多
好吧！轮到我了！这回死定了！瞧他这眼神，里面有匕首，绳子，还有老鼠药！</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨
到你了，你这副模样还算是个人吗！站在太阳底下，都找不见你的影子！你就像条病恹恹的鳝鱼，你就是死神和饥饿之魔的长子！瘦得只剩下一把骨头，饿死的沙丁鱼都比你强！</p>
<p>兰佩多 我承认我瘦。我就是个瘦子，那么，就请您饶过我吧。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 你为什么给我指大道？就因为走大道能经过你们这个旅馆？</p>
<p>兰佩多 人嘛，您知道的，都得活命。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 没错，但人也必有一死。</p>
<p>兰佩多 求您看在我死去的父母面上！</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 我这就让你和他们见面——窗子开着呢，先生，来吧，准备好。</p>
<p>兰佩多 求您三思啊！我这一跳指不定会伤到大街上的哪一位呢。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨
那么，好吧，我会把你扔到骰子盒里摇成碎片，或者把你放进咖啡研磨机里碾成粉末，你就能和冥王一起喝咖啡了——好了，做好准备吧！而我，要用这把小刀当成刺血针，让你饥饿的灵魂都流干净（因为你没有血），然后把你钉在墙上，让你看上去就像一只被钉子刺穿的干瘪的甲虫。</p>
<p>兰佩多 请看在我那可怜的老婆份上放过我吧。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 你老婆！</p>
<p>兰佩多 是的，我的老婆，先生。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 你这种人也配结婚？你这个卑鄙无耻、身上没几两肉的家伙！</p>
<p>兰佩多
啊，就请看在她的份上放过我吧！我有老婆，还有三个天使般的孩子，您要是还用这种杀人的眼光看着我，那他们就要成为没爹的孤儿了。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨
算了吧，算了吧！老婆孩子不过是你的借口。来吧，来吧；把药片吃了！药片去哪儿了？要不你现在就动手做两片。</p>
<p>兰佩多 在这盒子里。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 潘多拉的盒子，每一粒药片都能让你得十种病呢，吃了他们。</p>
<p>兰佩多 什么？全部？</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨
没错，全部；动作快点，来吧，先生，开始吧——（兰佩多吃了一片）很好！——再来一片。</p>
<p>兰佩多 一次只能吃一片。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 别磨磨蹭蹭的。</p>
<p>兰佩多
那我成什么了？死就死吧，先容我把店好好整顿一下，然后，让我像伟大的凯撒一样，体面地死去。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨
去你的！你要多谢你的运气，我没有把你放在你自己的研钵里给捣烂，或者把你制成蜥蜴标本示众。</p>
<p>兰佩多 这倒是不错！——这样就不用为吃饭谋生发愁了。</p>
<p>巴尔扎萨 回家吧，先生！从此做个稍微正派些的人吧。</p>
<p>兰佩多 要是我做不到的话，至少我得变得聪明些。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-63-4">LESSON 63</h2>
<p>RIP VAN WINKLE</p>
<p>瑞普·凡·温克尔 (1)</p>
<p>The appearance of Rip, with his long, grizzled beard, his rusty
fowling piece, his uncouth dress, and an army of women and children at
his heels, soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians. They
crowded around him, eying him from head to foot with great curiosity.
The orator bustled up to him, and, drawing him partly aside, inquired on
which side he voted. Rip stared in vacant stupidity. Another short but
busy little fellow pulled him by the arm, and, rising on tiptoe,
inquired in his ear “whether he was Federal or Democrat.”</p>
<p>Rip was equally at a loss to comprehend the question; when a knowing,
self-important old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way
through the crowd, putting them to the right and left with his elbows as
he passed, and planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo,
the other resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat, penetrating,
as it were, into his very soul, demanded, in an austere tone, what
brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his
heels, and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village.</p>
<p>“Alas! gentlemen,” cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, “I am a poor, quiet
man, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the king, God bless
him!” Here a general shout burst from the bystanders.—“A tory! a tory! a
spy! a refugee! hustle him! away with him!” It was with great difficulty
that the self-important man in the cocked hat restored order; and,
having a tenfold austerity of brow, demanded again of the unknown
culprit, what he came there for, and whom he was seeking. The poor man
humbly assured him that he meant no harm, but merely came there in
search of some of his neighbors, who used to keep about the tavern.
“Well, who are they? name them.”</p>
<p>Rip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, “Where’s Nicholas
Vedder?” There was a silence for a little while, when an old man
replied, in a thin, piping voice, “Nicholas Vedder! why he is dead and
gone these eighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone in the
churchyard that used to tell all about him, but that’s rotten and gone
too.” “Where’s Brom Dutcher?” “Oh, he went off to the army in the
beginning of the war. Some say he was killed at the storming of Stony
Point; others say he was drowned in a squall at the foot of Anthony’s
Nose. I don’t know; he never came back again.”</p>
<p>“Where’s Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?” “He went off to the wars,
too; was a great militia general, and is now in Congress.” Rip’s heart
died away at hearing of these sad changes in his home and friends, and
finding himself thus alone in the world. Every answer puzzled him, too,
by treating of such enormous lapses of time, and of matters which he
could not understand—war, Congress, Stony Point. He had no courage to
ask after any more friends, but cried out in despair, “Does nobody here
know Rip Van Winkle?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Rip Van Winkle!” exclaimed two or three. “Oh, to be sure! That’s
Rip Van Winkle yonder, leaning against the tree.” Rip looked, and beheld
a precise counterpart of himself as he went up the mountain; apparently
as lazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor fellow was now completely
confounded; he doubted his own identity, and whether he was himself or
another man. In the midst of his bewilderment, the man in the cocked hat
demanded who he was, and what was his name.</p>
<p>“God knows!” exclaimed he, at his wit’s end. “I’m not myself; I’m
somebody else; that’s me yonder; no, that’s somebody else got into my
shoes. I was myself last night; but I fell asleep on the mountain, and
they’ve changed my gun, and everything’s changed, and I’m changed, and I
can’t tell what’s my name or who I am!”</p>
<p>The bystanders began now to look at each other, nod, wink
significantly, and tap their fingers against their foreheads. There was
a whisper, also, about securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from
doing mischief, at the very suggestion of which the self-important man
in the cocked hat retired with some precipitation. At this critical
moment, a fresh, comely woman pressed through the throng to get a peep
at the gray-bearded man. She had a chubby child in her arms, which,
frightened at his looks, began to cry. “Hush, Rip!” cried she, “hush,
you little fool! the old man won’t hurt you.”</p>
<p>The name of the child, the air of the mother, the tone of her voice,
all awakened a train of recollections in his mind. “What is your name,
my good woman?” asked he. “Judith Gardenier.” “And your father’s name?”
“Ah, poor man! Rip Van Winkle was his name; but it’s twenty years since
he went away from home with his gun, and never has been heard of since;
his dog came home without him; but whether he shot himself, or was
carried away by the Indians, nobody can tell. I was then but a little
girl.”</p>
<p>Rip had but one question more to ask; but he put it with a faltering
voice: “Where’s your mother?” “Oh, she, too, died but a short time
since; she broke a blood vessel in a fit of passion at a New England
peddler.” There was a drop of comfort, at least, in this intelligence.
The honest man could contain himself no longer. He caught his daughter
and her child in his arms. “I am your father!” cried he. “Young Rip Van
Winkle once, old Rip Van Winkle now! Does nobody know poor Rip Van
Winkle?”</p>
<p>All stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among the
crowd, put her hand to her brow, and, peering under it in his face for a
moment, exclaimed, “Sure enough! it is Rip Van Winkle! it is himself!
Welcome home again, old neighbor! Why, where have you been these twenty
long years?” Rip’s story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had
been to him but as one night.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, the company broke up and returned to the
more important concerns of the election. Rip’s daughter took him home to
live with her. She had a snug, well-furnished house, and a stout, cheery
farmer for a husband, whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that
used to climb upon his back. Rip now resumed his old walks and habits.
He soon found many of his former cronies, though all rather the worse
for the wear and tear of time, and preferred making friends among the
rising generation, with whom he soon grew into great favor.</p>
<p>(Irving)</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-510">中文阅读</h4>
<p>他蓄着花白的长须，穿着一身出土文物般的衣衫，手里拿着一杆锈迹斑斑的猎枪，身后跟着一大群指指点点的妇孺。这很快引起了酒馆里那帮政客的注意。他们把他围了个水泄不通，无比好奇地将他上上下下一番打量。那个演说者赶忙挤上前去，把他拉向一边，问他会把选票投给谁。瑞普神情迷茫，一副不明所以的蠢样。另一个上蹿下跳的小个子拖住他的胳膊，踮起了脚尖，凑近他耳边悄声问他“是站在联邦党那一边还是民主党那一边”。</p>
<p>这个问题同样让瑞普如坠迷雾；就在这时，一个精明自负的长者，戴着一顶尖尖的三角帽，从人群中挤了过来，边走边撑起手肘左右开弓，将人群拨到两边，而后笔直地站到了凡·温克尔跟前，他一手叉腰，一手握着手杖，他目光如炬，眼神就和他头上的帽子尖儿一般锐利，仿佛能一下子穿透瑞普的灵魂。老者口吻严厉，质问他为何扛着把枪，拉了一帮乌合之众来参加选举，又问他是不是想在村里煽风点火，唯恐天下不乱。</p>
<p>“哎呀，先生！”瑞普可怜巴巴地叫道。“我可是个本本分分的可怜人，生在这里，长在这里，是国王陛下忠实的臣民，愿上帝保佑他！”一听这话，四下里便炸开了锅，“英国人的奴才！英国人的奴才！他是个奸细！是个逃犯！把他轰出去！叫他见鬼去吧！”那个戴着三角帽、模样自负的人费了好大的工夫才让众人平静下来，他眉头紧蹙，神情越发严厉，然后又向引发众怒的瑞普发问，为什么来这儿，来找谁？可怜的瑞普低声下气地跟他保证他绝无恶意，他来这里只是为了寻找以前常和他在酒馆打发时间的老邻居。“那么，他们都是谁？报一下他们的名字。”</p>
<p>瑞普想了一会儿，然后问道，“尼古拉斯·维德在哪儿？”四周没人吭声。过了片刻，一个老头用他笛声般尖细的声音答道，“尼古拉斯·维德！他早就死了，都死了十八年了！教堂墓地里曾经立着一块木头墓碑，上面刻着他的生平，不过已经烂得连渣子也没有了。”“布洛姆·达彻在哪儿？”“哦，战争一爆发他就去当兵了。有人说他在斯特尼波因特突袭中阵亡了。也有人说他在安东尼努斯山下的暴风雨中淹死了。他最后到底怎么样，我也不清楚。不过，之后他再也没有回来过。”</p>
<p>“那个小学教员凡·巴梅尔呢？”“他也去打仗了；后来当上了将军，现在国会里做事。”家人和朋友们所遭受的变故听得瑞普的心直往下沉，他突然感到自己成了世上最孤苦伶仃的人。每一个回答都让他糊涂，似乎这其中已不知过去了许多年，还有他们提到的新名词——战争——国会——斯特尼波因特——他都听不明白。他已经没有勇气继续打听其他朋友的情况，而是绝望地喊道，“这儿有人认识瑞普·凡·温克尔吗？”</p>
<p>“哦，瑞普·凡·温克尔，”两三个人惊叫起来。“哦，他呀！那不就是瑞普·凡·温克尔嘛，靠在树上的那一个。”瑞普看到了那个男人，和他上山时的模样就像是一模子里刻出来的一样。不用多说，就看得出这家伙和他以前一样不爱干活，邋里邋遢。可怜的瑞普此时被彻底搞糊涂了。他开始疑惑自己究竟是谁，他是他自己，还是某个其他人。就在他一脑袋浆糊的时候，那个戴着三角帽的人再度问他到底是谁，让他报上姓名。</p>
<p>“天知道！”瑞普叫道，他想破了脑袋也想不明白这究竟是怎么一回事。“我不是我；我是另一个人。那边的那个人是我；不，那不过是一个和我长得一模一样的人。昨天晚上我还是我呀；可我在山上睡过去了，他们换了我的枪，把一切都变了样，把我自己也给换了，我说不出我的名字，也说不出我是谁？”</p>
<p>大家你看看我，我看看你，然后彼此心照不宣地点点头，眨眨眼，拍了拍自己的脑门。有人小声商量着要不要缴了这个疯老头的枪，免得他接下去干出什么出格的事来。那个戴着三角帽、高傲自负的绅士一听这话便匆匆忙忙地离场了。正在这时，一个面容姣好的女人挤到人群前面，想仔细看看这个长着灰白胡子的老人，她怀里抱着一个胖乎乎的宝宝，那孩子一见瑞普的长相便吓得哭了起来。“嘘，瑞普！”她对孩子说，“安静，你这个小傻瓜！这个老爷爷不会伤害你的。”</p>
<p>孩子的名字，女人的神态还有她说话的语调，勾起了埋藏在他记忆深处的一连串回忆。“请问您叫什么名字，好心的夫人？”他问道。“朱蒂丝·嘉顿妮尔，”她答道。“那您的父亲是？”“哦，可怜的人！他叫瑞普·凡·温克尔，可是二十年前，他带着猎枪离开了家，此后再也没有他的消息。他的狗回来了，可他却没有。他是开枪自杀了，还是被印第安人掳走了，谁也不知道。我当时还只是一个小女孩。”</p>
<p>瑞普只剩下一个问题了。他颤颤巍巍，声音直发抖：“你母亲在哪儿？”“哦，她去世了，就在不久前。她对一个上门兜售产品的新英格兰人大发脾气，结果血管爆裂，一命呜呼。”这个消息让他感到稍许安慰。这个老实人再也无法控制自己。他一把抱住他的女儿和她的孩子。“我是你的父亲！”他哭着说道。“从前是年轻的瑞普·凡·温克尔，现在成了老瑞普·凡·温克尔了。这儿就没有人认得可怜的瑞普·凡·温克尔吗？”</p>
<p>大家傻站在原地，个个目瞪口呆，直到一个老妇人哆哆嗦嗦地来扒开人群走上前来，她抬起胳膊，用手遮着额头，盯着他的脸细细地打量了片刻，然后惊叫起来：“没错！是瑞普·凡·温克尔！就是他本人！欢迎您回家，我的老邻居！可是老天啊，这二十年里您究竟到哪儿去了？”瑞普的故事只需只字片语就讲完了，因为对他来说这整整二十年不过就是短短的一夜时间。</p>
<p>长话短说，人群散开了，转而回到了他们更为关心的话题——选举。瑞普的女儿带着父亲回家和她一起生活。她的家温暖舒适，一应俱全，她丈夫是一个结实快乐的农夫，瑞普记得他还是个小顽童的时候，自己经常驮着他跑来跑去。瑞普又回到了原先的生活轨迹，平日里的习惯也和过去没啥两样。他很快找到了许多从前的老友，不过他们都已被岁月摧残得面目全非，所以他更喜欢和年轻人做朋友，而且在他们当中颇受欢迎。</p>

<p>Oliver Wendell Holmes, 1809-1894, was the son of Abiel Holmes, D.D.
He was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and graduated at Harvard in
1829, having for classmates several men who have since become
distinguished. After graduating, he studied law for about one year, and
then turned his attention to medicine. He studied his profession in
Paris, and elsewhere in Europe, and took his degree at Cambridge in
1836. In 1838 he was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Physiology in
Dartmouth College. He remained here but a short time, and then returned
to Boston and entered on the practice of medicine. In 1847 he was
appointed professor at Harvard, filling a similar position to the one
held at Dartmouth. He discharged the duties of his professorship for
more than thirty years, with great success. Literature was never his
profession; yet few American authors attained higher success, both as a
poet and as a prose writer. His poems are lively and sparkling, abound
in wit and humor, but are not wanting in genuine pathos. Many of them
were composed for special occasions. His prose writings include works on
medicine, essays, and novels; several appeared first as contributions to
the “Atlantic Monthly.” He gained reputation, also, as it popular
lecturer. In person, Dr. Holmes was small and active, with a face
expressive of thought and vivacity.</p>
<p>Come, dear old comrade, you and I</p>
<p>Will steal an hour from days gone by—</p>
<p>The shining days when life was new,</p>
<p>And all was bright as morning dew,</p>
<p>The lusty days of long ago,</p>
<p>When you were Bill and I was Joe.</p>
<p>Your name may flaunt a titled trail</p>
<p>Proud as a cockerel’s rainbow tail,</p>
<p>And mine as brief appendix wear</p>
<p>As Tam O’Shanter’s luckless mare;</p>
<p>To-day, old friend, remember still</p>
<p>That I am Joe and you are Bill.</p>
<p>You’ve won the great world’s envied prize,</p>
<p>And grand you look in people’s eyes,</p>
<p>With HON. and LL. D.,</p>
<p>In big, brave letters fair to see,—</p>
<p>Your fist, old fellow! Off they go!—</p>
<p>How are you, Bill? How are you, Joe?</p>
<p>You’ve worn the judge’s ermined robe;</p>
<p>You’ve taught your name to half the globe;</p>
<p>You’ve sung mankind a deathless strain;</p>
<p>You’ve made the dead past live again:</p>
<p>The world may call you what it will,</p>
<p>But you and I are Joe and Bill.</p>
<p>The chaffing young folks stare and say,</p>
<p>“See those old buffers, bent and gray;</p>
<p>They talk like fellows in their teens;</p>
<p>Mad, poor old boys! That’s what it means”</p>
<p>And shake their heads; they little know</p>
<p>The throbbing hearts of Bill and Joe—</p>
<p>How Bill forgets his hour of pride,</p>
<p>While Joe sits smiling at his side;</p>
<p>How Joe, in spite of time’s disguise,</p>
<p>Finds the old schoolmate in his eyes,—</p>
<p>Those calm, stern eyes, that melt and fill,</p>
<p>As Joe looks fondly up to Bill.</p>
<p>Ah! pensive scholar, what is fame?</p>
<p>A fitful tongue of leaping flame;</p>
<p>A giddy whirlwind’s fickle gust,</p>
<p>That lifts a pinch of mortal dust;</p>
<p>A few swift years, and who can show</p>
<p>Which dust was Bill, and which was Joe.</p>
<p>The weary idol takes his stand,</p>
<p>Holds out his bruised and aching hand,</p>
<p>While gaping thousands come and go—</p>
<p>How vain it seems, this empty show!—</p>
<p>Till all at once his pulses thrill:</p>
<p>’T is poor old Joe’s, “God bless you, Bill!”</p>
<p>And shall we breathe in happier spheres</p>
<p>The names that pleased our mortal ears;</p>
<p>In some sweet lull of heart and song</p>
<p>For earth born spirits none too long,</p>
<p>Just whispering of the world below</p>
<p>When this was Bill, and that was Joe?</p>
<p>No matter; while our home is here,</p>
<p>No sounding name is half so dear;</p>
<p>When fades at length our lingering day,</p>
<p>Who cares what pompous tombstones say?</p>
<p>Read on the hearts that love us still,</p>
<p>Hic jacet Joe. Hic jacet Bill.</p>

<p>来吧，亲爱的老朋友，让我俩</p>
<p>从逝去的岁月里偷回片刻时光——</p>
<p>那时阳光普照大地，生命刚刚起航，</p>
<p>如同清晨的露珠一般耀眼闪亮，</p>
<p>快乐的日子已一去不再，</p>
<p>那时你是比尔，我是乔。</p>
<p>你的名字听上去像是带着名号</p>
<p>就像小公鸡的尾巴七彩炫耀，</p>
<p>而我的却像《汤姆·奥桑特》里倒霉的母驴</p>
<p>掉落的尾巴那么短小多余；</p>
<p>今天，老朋友，你可还记得</p>
<p>我是乔，你是比尔。</p>
<p>如今，你赢得了举世艳羡的奖品，</p>
<p>众人眼里的你高大无比，</p>
<p>名字前的尊称还有法学博士的头衔，</p>
<p>都用大写字母表示引人注意，——</p>
<p>你的拳头，老伙计！他们去了哪里！——</p>
<p>你好吗，比尔？你好吗，乔？</p>
<p>你已经穿上了法官的长袍；</p>
<p>你的名字已被半个地球知道；</p>
<p>你为世人哼唱不朽的旋律；</p>
<p>你让死去的人再度苏醒，</p>
<p>这个世界爱怎么叫你我管不着，</p>
<p>但你和我一直都是比尔和乔。</p>

<p>看他们聊得，还以为自己才十七八；</p>
<p>疯了，可怜的老男孩！除了发疯没有其他”</p>
<p>他们摇着脑袋；他们哪里知道</p>
<p>比尔和乔的心在胸膛里狂跳——</p>
<p>比尔忘记了那些骄傲的分秒，</p>
<p>当乔坐在他身边微笑；</p>
<p>乔察觉到了老同学眼里的变化，</p>
<p>虽然时间爱耍易容的花招，</p>
<p>当乔望着比尔，满心欢喜，</p>
<p>那冰冷在融化，严厉变笑意。</p>
<p>啊！沉思中的学者，名望是什么东西？</p>
<p>是吐着火舌的火焰，捉摸不定；</p>
<p>狂风乍起，平地漩涡，</p>
<p>卷起了俗世尘土一撮；</p>
<p>岁月如梭，有谁能知晓</p>
<p>尘土中哪些是比尔，哪些是乔。</p>
<p>残旧的雕像站在原地，</p>
<p>伸出的手上伤痕累累，酸痛无比，</p>
<p>他凝视着无数的人来了又去——</p>
<p>这场空洞的表演有多虚荣！</p>
<p>直到突然间，他的心头一阵悸动：</p>
<p>这是可怜的老乔，“上帝保佑你，比尔！”</p>
<p>那些我们生前爱听的名字</p>
<p>会让我们更加愉快地呼吸；</p>
<p>尘世的生命都不长久，</p>
<p>奏响柔美的安眠曲为他们送行，</p>
<p>这时，地下传来窃窃私语</p>
<p>可哪个声音是比尔，哪个是乔？</p>
<p>不打紧；当我们把家安在这里，</p>
<p>没有名字及得上他们一半贴心；</p>
<p>当我们留恋的日子最终逝去，</p>
<p>谁会在意浮华的墓碑上雕刻的字迹？</p>
<p>只有那些依然爱我们的人会往下看，</p>
<p>安息于此的乔。安息于此的比尔。</p>

<p>SORROW FOR THE DEAD</p>
<p>对逝者的哀思</p>
<p>The sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be
divorced. Every other wound we seek to heal; every other affliction, to
forget; but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open. This
affliction we cherish, and brood over in solitude. Where is the mother
who would willingly forget the infant that has perished like a blossom
from her arms, though every recollection is a pang? Where is the child
that would willingly forget a tender parent, though to remember be but
to lament? Who, even in the hour of agony, would forget the friend over
whom he mourns?</p>
<p>No, the love which survives the tomb is one of the noblest attributes
of the soul. If it has its woes, it has likewise its delights: and when
the overwhelming burst of grief is calmed into the gentle tear of
recollection; when the sudden anguish and the convulsive agony over the
present ruins of all that we most loved, is softened away into pensive
meditation on all that it was in the days of its loveliness, who would
root out such a sorrow from the heart? Though it may, sometimes, throw a
passing cloud over the bright hour of gayety, or spread a deeper sadness
over the hour of gloom; yet, who would exchange it even for the song of
pleasure, or the burst of revelry? No, there is a voice from the tomb
sweeter than song. There is a remembrance of the dead, to which we turn
even from the charms of the living.</p>
<p>Oh, the grave! the grave! It buries every error, covers every defect,
extinguishes every resentment! From its peaceful bosom spring none but
fond regrets and tender recollections. Who can look down upon the grave
even of an enemy, and not feel a compunctious throb, that he should have
warred with the poor handful of earth that lies moldering before him?
But the grave of those we loved—what a place for meditation! There it is
that we call up, in long review, the whole history of virtue and
gentleness, and the thousand endearments lavished upon us, almost
unheeded in the daily intercourse of intimacy; there it is that we dwell
upon the tenderness, the solemn, awful tenderness of the parting scene;
the bed of death, with all its stifled griefs, its noiseless attendance,
its mute, watchful assiduities! the last testimonies of expiring love!
the feeble, fluttering, thrilling,—oh! how thrilling!—pressure of the
hand! the last fond look of the glazing eye turning upon us, even from
the threshold of existence! the faint, faltering accents, struggling in
death to give one more assurance of affection!</p>
<p>Ay, go to the grave of buried love, and meditate! There settle the
account with thy conscience for every past benefit unrequited; every
past endearment unregarded, of that departed being, who can
never—never—never return to be soothed by thy contrition! If thou art a
child, and hast ever added a sorrow to the soul, or a furrow to the
silvered brow of an affectionate parent; if thou art a husband, and hast
ever caused the fond bosom that ventured its whole happiness in thy arms
to doubt one moment of thy kindness or thy truth; if thou art a friend,
and hast ever wronged, in thought, or word, or deed, the spirit that
generously confided in thee; if thou hast given one unmerited pang to
that true heart, which now lies cold and still beneath thy feet; then be
sure that every unkind look, every ungracious word, every ungentle
action, will come thronging back upon thy memory, and knocking dolefully
at thy soul; then be sure that thou wilt lie down sorrowing and
repentant on the grave, and utter the unheard groan, and pour the
unavailing tear; more deep, more bitter, because unheard and
unavailing.</p>
<p>Then weave thy chaplet of flowers, and strew the beauties of nature
about the grave; console thy broken spirit, if thou canst, with these
tender, yet futile, tributes of regret: but take warning by the
bitterness of this, thy contrite affliction over the dead, and
henceforth be more faithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy
duties to the living.</p>

<p>对逝者的哀思是这个世界上我们唯一不愿忘怀的悲痛。其他的创伤我们只求迅速治愈，其他的折磨我们恨不能从此不复记忆，然而唯有这道创伤我们但愿它永不愈合。这种折磨我们视若珍宝，在孤身独处时，我们忧思萦绕，反复念及。有哪位母亲舍得忘记死去的宝贝，他像花朵在怀中枯萎，即便每一次回忆都会让她心碎？有哪一个孩子忍心忘记慈爱的双亲，虽然每一次想起都会唤醒伤悲？又有谁会忘记他悼念的好友，即便是在伤心欲绝的时候？</p>
<p>不，那份没有被坟墓掩埋的眷恋是人类情感中最为高贵的品质之一。它会带来痛苦，而它也同样带来欢乐：当排山倒海的悲痛慢慢平息，化为回忆中坠落眼角的一滴轻柔之泪，当面对至爱烟消云散，那突如其来、让我们肝肠寸断的尖锐心痛，渐渐地融化成对往昔美好岁月的追忆与缅怀，有谁会将这样的悼念从心灵深处连根拔起？尽管有时它会让欢悦的时刻蒙上阴云，抑或在惆怅的时候更添愁绪；然而，有谁会拿它来交换一曲欢歌，或是一场饮宴？不，墓碑底下传来的歌谣更加动人心弦。有时，我们甚至会忘记了生者的美好，转而沉湎于对死者的无尽怀恋。</p>
<p>啊！坟墓！坟墓！它埋葬了所有错误，遮盖了所有的缺点，化解了所有的恩怨。它那宁静的胸膛，放任多情的遗憾，孕育温柔的怀想。即便俯视敌人的墓碑，难道没有人的心头闪过一丝恻隐：躺在墓地里的那个人就合该与一杯黄土一起腐烂？而我们所爱之人长眠的地方——那是一方寄托哀思的圣地。在那里，我们回忆起逝者一生的美德善举，回忆起他们倾注在我们身上的无私关爱，可在那些亲昵相伴的日子里我们竟未曾留意，忘了珍惜；在那里，我们念念不忘临别一刻的难分难舍，庄重肃穆以及心碎神伤；长卧不起的病榻前，弥漫着让人窒息的哀伤，我们相对无语地陪伴，日以继夜地守望！还有最后爱的证据！那虚弱的，颤抖的，让人悸动的——啊！那是多么让人悸动的！——轻轻一握！那离开尘世前停驻在我们身上恋恋不舍的目光！还有那无法听清的、微颤的声音，挣扎着要给我们多留下一份爱的表达！</p>
<p>啊，去到你所爱之人的墓地反躬自省吧！那里沉睡着许多你无以回报的恩情以及被你忽略的善意，你的良心将把一切一一记起，然而逝者将永远——永远——永远不能折返尘世，永远听不到你的痛悔而感到慰藉！如果你是一个孩子，曾给深爱你的父母亲带来忧伤，给他们飘着银发的额头刻上一道皱纹，如果你是一个丈夫，曾让把毕生幸福的筹码押在你怀抱的女人对你的善良与忠贞有过片刻的怀疑，如果你是一个朋友，在心中，言语或行动上误解了无条件信任你的好友，如果你让一颗正直的心蒙受了冤屈，而那颗心现在正冰冷地，静静地躺在你的脚下，那么毫无疑问，所有冷酷的表情，无礼的言辞以及粗鲁的举动都会齐齐涌入记忆，无情地敲打你的灵魂；你会伤心地卧倒在墓地，追悔莫及，你会因为地下的至爱再也听不到你痛苦的呻吟、再也看不见你汹涌的泪水而哭得更加悲切，更加凄厉。</p>
<p>然后，你献上花圈，用自然的美丽将墓地细心装点；倘若可以，就用这些微不足道的忏悔安慰自己破碎的心灵：但此番痛苦经历你要引以为戒，逝者已逝，悔悟已迟，你要以更多的忠诚、更多的关爱承担起对生者的责任。</p>

<p>THE EAGLE</p>
<p>鹰之歌</p>
<p>James Gates Percival, 1795-1856, was born at Berlin, Connecticut, and
graduated at Yale College in 1815, at the head of his class. He was
admitted to the practice of medicine in 1820, and went to Charleston,
South Carolina. In 1824 he was appointed Professor of Chemistry at West
Point, a position which he held but a few months. In 1854 he was
appointed State Geologist of Wisconsin, and died at Hazel Green, in that
state. Dr. Percival was eminent as a geographer, geologist, and
linguist. He began to write poetry at an early age, and his fame rests
chiefly upon his writings in this department. In his private life,
Percival was always shy, modest, and somewhat given to melancholy.
Financially, his life was one of struggle, and he was often greatly
straitened for money.</p>

<p>POLITICAL TOLERATION</p>
<p>政治信仰自由</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson, 1743-1826, the third President of the United
States, and the author of the Declaration of Independence, was born in
Albemarle County, Virginia. He received most of his early education
under private tutors, and at the age of seventeen entered William and
Mary College, where he remained two years. At college, where he studied
industriously, he formed the acquaintance of several distinguished men,
among them was George Wythe, with whom he entered on the study of law.
At the age of twenty-four he was admitted to the bar, and soon rose to
high standing in his profession. In 1775 he entered the Colonial
Congress, having previously served ably in the legislature of his native
state. Although one of the youngest men in Congress, he soon took a
foremost place in that body. He left Congress in the fall of 1776, and,
as a member of the legislature, and later as Governor of Virginia, he
was chiefly instrumental in effecting several important reforms in the
laws of that state,—the most notable were the abolition of the law of
primogeniture, and the passage of a law making all religious
denominations equal. From 1785 to 1789 he was Minister to France. On his
return to America he was made Secretary of State, in the first Cabinet.
While in this office, he became the leader of the Republican or
Anti-Federalist party, in opposition to the Federalist party led by
Alexander Hamilton. From 1801 to 1809 he was President. On leaving his
high office, he retired to his estate at “Monticello,” where he passed
the closing years of his life, and died on the 4th of July, just fifty
years after the passage of his famous Declaration. His compatriot, and
sometimes bitter political opponent, John Adams, died on the same
day.</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson, who was never a ready public speaker, was a remarkably
clear and forcible writer; his works fill several large volumes. In
personal character, he was pure and simple, cheerful, and disposed to
look on the bright side. His knowledge of life rendered his conversation
highly attractive. The chief enterprise of his later years was the
founding of the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville.</p>
<p>During the contest of opinion through which we have passed, the
animation of discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect
which might impose on strangers, unused to think freely and to speak and
to write what they think; but this being now decided by the voice of the
nation, announced according to the rules of the constitution, all will,
of course, arrange themselves under the will of the law, and unite in
common efforts for the common good.</p>
<p>All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that, though the
will of the majority is, in all cases, to prevail, that will, to be
rightful, must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal
rights, which equal laws must protect, and to violate which would be
oppression. Let us then, fellow-citizens, unite with one heart and one
mind.</p>
<p>Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection,
without which liberty, and even life itself, are but dreary things; and
let us reflect, that, having banished from our land that religious
intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have
gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic, as
wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions.</p>
<p>During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world; during the
agonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking, through blood and
slaughter, his long-lost liberty; it was not wonderful that the
agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful
shore; that this should be more felt and feared by some, and less by
others, and should divide opinions as to measures of safety.</p>
<p>But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We
have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are
all Republicans; we are all Federalists. If there be any among us who
would wish to dissolve this Union, or to change its republican form, let
them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of
opinion may be tolerated when reason is left free to combat it.</p>
<p>I know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a republican
government can not be strong; that this government is not strong enough.
But would the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment,
abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm, on the
theoretic and visionary fear that this government, the world’s best
hope, may, by possibility, want energy to preserve itself? I trust not;
I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest government on earth.</p>
<p>I believe it to be the only one where every man, at the call of the
law, would fly to the standard of the law, and would meet invasions of
the public order as his own personal concern. Sometimes it is said that
man can not be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be
trusted with the government of others, or have we found angels, in the
form of kings, to govern him? Let history answer this question. Let us,
then, with courage and confidence, pursue our own federal and republican
principles; our attachment to union and representative government.</p>

<p>在我们已有的思想火花的碰撞中，大家畅所欲言，各抒己见，对于那些不习惯自由思考，说出或写下自己想法的人而言，这种唇枪舌剑的激烈交锋会让他们感到局促不安；可是现在，既然民众的呼声决定了这场辩论的结果，而这一结果又是根据宪法条文予以公布的，那么所有的意志必然臣服于法律的意志，并各司其位，为共同的利益齐心合力。</p>
<p>我们所有人都要牢记这一神圣的原则：尽管就一切情况而言，多数人的意志总会占得上风，但只有当这种意志是合理正当的，它才是合法公正的；而另一方面，少数人享有同等的权利，这种权利必须同样受到法律保护，如果遭受侵犯，那便是压迫。合众国的公民们，就让我们团结起来，一起奋斗。</p>
<p>就让我们彼此之间的交往沟通回归和谐，再度充满友爱，如果没有这些，自由甚至生活本身都会变得索然无味；让我们回想一下，常年以来，宗教信仰上的不容异说曾经造成了多少流血事件，让人类蒙受了多少苦痛，现在我们已将这种偏执狭隘连根拔除。可是，如果我们纵容政治上的不宽容，任由其变得专横、邪恶，变得像残酷、血腥的迫害一样，那么我们终将一事无成。</p>
<p>当有着悠久历史的旧世界经历阵痛与震颤的时候，当激愤的人们苦苦挣扎着想杀出一条血路以找回丧失已久的自由，那澎湃的激情所掀起的滔天巨浪也许会冲击这片与世无争的海岸；对此，有人视之为洪水猛兽，惶恐不安，有人却认为不足为虑，坦然无惧，于是对于应采取怎样的安全措施也是莫衷一是，而所有这些都不足为奇。</p>
<p>但是，并不是所有的意见相左都意味着原则相左。我们曾用不同的名字来称呼秉承同一原则的兄弟。我们都是共和党人，我们都是联邦党人，如果我们中间有人妄图拆散这个统一的联邦，或者想要改变它的共和制，请不要阻挠干涉他们，就让他们作为安全的丰碑矗立在这片国土之上，此时错误的观念得到了宽容接纳，而理性则能够自由地与之抗争。</p>
<p>诚然，我知道，有些忠良之士担心一个共和制的政府无法成为强而有力的政府，担心这个政府目前势单力薄；但是，一个忠诚的爱国之士，难道会在我们的宏图伟业一日千里、势如破竹之时，仅仅因为一些不着边际、捕风捉影的疑惧，就认为这个集全世界热望于一身的政府或许要借助外力才能得以自保，从而就此放弃这个迄今为止给我们带来了自由、教会我们坚定的政府吗？我相信答案是否定的。相反，我坚信，在这个世界上，我们的政府坚不可摧。</p>
<p>我坚信只有在这种政府的治理下，每个人才会响应法律的召唤，从四面八方齐聚到法律这面旗帜下，当看到公共秩序受到侵犯时，我们会像自己的切身利益受到侵犯一样给予迎头痛击。有人说：一个为民所有的政府不可信。那么，一个不为民所有的政府就可信了吗？又或者，在君主制的历史中，我们能不能找出任何一个君王曾像天使一般治理过他的人民？这个问题就留待历史来给出答案吧。让我们鼓起勇气，充满信心，继续追随属于我们自己的联邦共和原则，拥戴联邦与代议制政府。</p>

<p>WHAT CONSTITUTES A STATE?</p>
<p>是什么构成了国家</p>
<p>Sir William Jones, 1746-1794, was the son of an eminent
mathematician; he early distinguished himself by his ability as a
student. He graduated at Oxford, became well versed in Oriental
literature, studied law, and wrote many able books. In 1783 he was
appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of Judicature in Bengal. He was a
man of astonishing learning, upright life, and Christian principles.</p>
<p>What constitutes a state?</p>
<p>Not high-raised battlement or labored mound,</p>
<p>Thick wall or moated gate;</p>
<p>Not cities proud with spires and turrets crowned;</p>
<p>Not bays and broad-armed ports,</p>
<p>Where, laughing at the storm, rich navies ride;</p>
<p>Not starred and spangled courts,</p>
<p>Where low-browed baseness wafts perfume to pride.</p>
<p>No:—men, high-minded men,</p>
<p>With powers as far above dull brutes endued</p>
<p>In forest, brake, or den,</p>
<p>As beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude,—</p>
<p>Men who their duties know,</p>
<p>But know their rights, and, knowing, dare maintain,</p>
<p>Prevent the long-aimed blow,</p>
<p>And crush the tyrant while they rend the chain:</p>
<p>These constitute a state;</p>
<p>And sovereign Law, that state’s collected will,</p>
<p>O’er thrones and globes elate,</p>
<p>Sits empress, crowning good, repressing ill.</p>

<p>THE BRAVE AT HOME</p>
<p>家中的勇士</p>
<p>Thomas Buchanan Read, 1822-1872, an American poet and painter, was
born in Chester County, Pennsylvania. At the age of seventeen he entered
a sculptor’s studio in Cincinnati. Here he gained reputation as a
painter of portraits. From this city he went to New York, Boston, and
Philadelphia, and soon after to Florence, Italy. In the later years of
his life, he divided his time between Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and
Rome. His complete poetical works fill three volumes. Several of his
most stirring poems relate to the Revolutionary War, and to the late
Civil War in America. Many of his poems are marked by vigor and a
ringing power, while smoothness and delicacy distinguish others, no
less.</p>
<p>The maid who binds her warrior’s sash,</p>
<p>And, smiling, all her pain dissembles,</p>

<p>SOUTH CAROLINA</p>
<p>南卡罗来纳州</p>
<p>Robert Young Hayne, 1791-1840, was born in Colleton District, South
Carolina, and studied and practiced law at Charleston. He was early
elected to the State Legislature, and became Speaker of the House and
Attorney-general of the state. He entered the Senate of the United
States at the age of thirty-one. He was Governor of South Carolina
during the “Nullification” troubles in 1832 and 1833. Mr. Hayne was a
clear and able debater, and a stanch advocate of the extreme doctrine of
“State Rights.” In the Senate he opposed the Tariff Bill of 1828; and,
out of this struggle, grew his famous debate with Daniel Webster in
1830. The following selection is an extract from Mr. Hayne’s speech on
that memorable occasion.</p>
<p>If there be one state in the Union, Mr. President, that may challenge
comparison with any other, for a uniform, zealous, ardent, and
uncalculating devotion to the Union, that state is South Carolina. Sir,
from the very commencement of the Revolution, up to this hour, there is
no sacrifice, however great, she has not cheerfully made; no service she
has ever hesitated to perform.</p>
<p>She has adhered to you in your prosperity; but in your adversity she
has clung to you with more than filial affection. No matter what was the
condition of her domestic affairs; though deprived of her resources,
divided by parties, or surrounded by difficulties, the call of the
country has been to her as the voice of God. Domestic discord ceased at
the sound; every man became at once reconciled to his brethren, and the
sons of Carolina were all seen, crowding to the temple, bringing their
gifts to the altar of their common country.</p>
<p>What, sir, was the conduct of the South, during the Revolution? Sir,
I honor New England for her conduct in that glorious struggle. But great
as is the praise which belongs to her, I think at least equal honor is
due to the South. Never were there exhibited, in the history of the
world, higher examples of noble daring, dreadful suffering, and heroic
endurance, than by the whigs of Carolina, during the Revolution. The
whole state, from the mountains to the sea, was overrun by an
overwhelming force of the enemy. The fruits of industry perished on the
spot where they were produced, or were consumed by the foe.</p>
<p>The plains of Carolina drank up the most precious blood of her
citizens. Black, smoking ruins marked the places which had been the
habitation of her children. Driven from their homes into the gloomy and
almost impenetrable swamps, even there the spirit of liberty survived,
and South Carolina, sustained by the example of her Sumters and her
Marions, proved, by her conduct, that though her soil might be overrun,
the spirit of her people was invincible.</p>

<p>总统先生，如果联邦有一个州，能始终如一、积极主动、满腔热诚地为合众国做出难以计数的贡献，对此没有别的州能与之匹敌，那么这个州就是南卡罗来纳州了。先生，自从独立战争打响第一枪那一刻，她就毫不犹豫地投入战斗，随时准备着欣然赴死。</p>
<p>在你成功的时候，她与你紧紧相依；在你身处逆境的时候，她更是赴汤蹈火，不离不弃。尽管她内部风波不断，尽管她的资源已被耗尽，党派纷争让她支离破碎，重重困难让她四面楚歌，可是只要祖国一声召唤，对她而言无疑等同于上帝之音。内部争斗戛然而止；全州上下万众一心，卡罗来纳州的子民聚集圣殿，在祖国的圣坛前献上热血与生命。</p>
<p>先生，独立战争中南卡罗来纳州表现如何？先生，对于新英格兰在这场光荣之战中的作为我心怀崇敬。虽然她获得了无数赞誉，但我认为南卡罗来纳州所获的荣誉至少应与之相当。纵观世界历史，从来没有人能像独立战争中的卡罗来纳州辉格党人一样英勇无惧，历经磨难，坚忍不拔。从高山到海洋，整个卡罗来纳州都在强敌的铁蹄之下备受蹂躏。产业工厂不是在其开花结果的地方被毁于一旦，就是遭敌人洗劫一空。</p>
<p>卡罗来纳州的大地上浸透了人民的鲜血。那片硝烟未散的焦土曾是她的孩子们安居的乐园。他们被迫离开家园，迁往阴暗潮湿、无处落脚的沼泽湿地，尽管环境恶劣，自由的精神却生生不息；在萨姆特们和马里恩们的精神照耀下，南卡罗来纳州以其英雄行为向世人证明了，尽管她的土地可能会被外敌征服，但她的成城众志却所向披靡。</p>

<p>MASSACHUSETTS AND SOUTH CAROLINA</p>
<p>马萨诸塞州和南卡罗来纳州</p>
<p>Daniel Webster, 1782-1852. This celebrated American statesman and
orator was born in Salisbury, New Hampshire. His father, Ebenezer
Webster, was a pioneer settler, a soldier in the Old French War and the
Revolution, and a man of ability and strict integrity, Daniel attended
the common school in his youth, and fitted for college under Rev. Samuel
Wood, of Boseawen, graduating at Dartmouth in 1801. He spent a few
months of his boyhood at “Phillips Academy,” Exeter, where he attained
distinction as a student, but was so diffident that he could never give
a declamation before his class. During his college course, and later, he
taught school several terms in order to increase his slender finances.
He was admitted to the bar in Boston in 1805. For the next eleven years,
he practiced his profession in his native state. In 1812 he was elected
to the United States House of Representatives, and at once took his
place as one of the most prominent men of that body. In 1816 he removed
to Boston; and in 1827 he was elected to the United States Senate, where
he continued for twelve years. In 1841 he was made Secretary of State,
and soon after negotiated the famous “Ashburton Treaty” with England,
settling the northern boundary of the United States. In 1845 he returned
to the Senate; and in 1850 he was re-appointed Secretary of State, and
continued in office till his death. He died at his country residence in
Marshfield, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Mr. Webster’s fame rests chiefly on his state papers and his speeches
in Congress; but he took a prominent part in some of the most famous law
cases of the present century. Several of his public addresses on
occasional themes are well known, also. As a speaker, he was dignified
and stately, using clear, straightforward, pure English. He had none of
the tricks of oratory. He was large of person, with a massive head, a
swarthy complexion, and deep-set, keen, and lustrous eyes. His grand
presence added much to his power as a speaker.</p>
<p>The eulogium pronounced on the character of the State of South
Carolina by the honorable gentleman, for her Revolutionary and other
merits, meets my hearty concurrence. I shall not acknowledge that the
honorable member goes before me, in regard for whatever of distinguished
talent or distinguished character South Carolina has produced. I claim
part of the honor; I partake in the pride of her great names. I claim
them for countrymen, one and all—the Laurenses, the Rutledges, the
Pinckneys, the Sumters, the Marions—Americans all—whose fame is no more
to be hemmed in by state lines than their talents and patriotism were
capable of being circumscribed within the same narrow limits.</p>
<p>In their day and generation, they served and honored the country, and
the whole country, and their renown is of the treasures of the whole
country. Him whose honored name the gentleman himself bears,—does he
suppose me less capable of gratitude for his patriotism, or sympathy for
his suffering, than if his eyes had first opened upon the light in
Massachusetts, instead of South Carolina? Sir, does he suppose it in his
power to exhibit in Carolina a name so bright as to produce envy in my
bosom? No, sir,—increased gratification and delight rather. Sir, I thank
God that, if I am gifted with little of the spirit which is said to be
able to raise mortals to the skies, I have yet none, as I trust, of that
other spirit which would drag angels down.</p>
<p>When I shall be found, sir, in my place here in the Senate, or
elsewhere, to sneer at public merit because it happened to spring up
beyond the little limits of my own state or neighborhood; when I refuse
for any such cause, or for any cause, the homage due to American talent,
to elevated patriotism, to sincere devotion to liberty and the country;
or if I see an uncommon endowment of Heaven; if I see extraordinary
capacity or virtue in any son of the South; and if, moved by local
prejudice, or gangrened by state jealousy, I get up here to abate a
tithe of a hair from his just character and just fame, may my tongue
cleave to the roof of my mouth!</p>
<p>Mr. President, I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts. She
needs none. There she is; behold her, and judge for yourselves. There is
her history; the world knows it by heart. The past, at least, is secure.
There is Boston, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; and there
they will remain forever. And, sir, where American Liberty raised its
first voice, and where its youth was nurtured and sustained, there it
still lives, in the strength of its manhood, and full of its original
spirit. If discord and disunion shall wound it; if party strife and
blind ambition shall hawk at and tear it; if folly and madness, if
uneasiness under salutary restraint, shall succeed to separate it from
that Union, by which alone its existence is made sure, it will stand, in
the end, by the side of that cradle in which its infancy was rocked; it
will stretch forth its arm, with whatever of vigor it may still retain,
over the friends who gathered around it; and it will fall at last, if
fall it must, amid the proudest monuments of its glory and on the very
spot of its origin.</p>

<p>尊敬的先生刚才一番对南卡罗来纳州、其独立战争中的先驱作用以及其他功勋的赞颂，激发了我心中由衷的共鸣。就南卡罗来纳州人民所具有的非凡才能与品德，我与先生的意见可谓不谋而合。很荣幸我能分享这份荣誉；分享她所带给我们的骄傲与自豪。我要说荣誉属于我的同胞们，属于每一个人——属于劳伦斯
(1) 们，拉特里奇 (2) 们，平克尼 (3)
们，萨姆特们，马里恩们——属于所有美国人——他们的名望与才华和他们的爱国情怀一样不会被州界或其他诸如此类的狭隘界限所桎梏。</p>
<p>他们将毕生奉献给了国家，效忠于国家——整个国家，他们的荣誉就是举国上下共有的财富。凭借自身才能和努力换得一世英名的仁人志士，难道会认为，我会因为他生于马萨诸塞州而不是南卡罗来纳州从而降低对他爱国情操的感激之情，或是因此减少对他所遭受的苦痛折磨而抱有的同情之心吗？先生，难道他认为他在南卡罗来纳州尽力展现的英名会让我嫉贤妒能吗？不，先生，我内心的欢欣喜悦有增无减。先生，我感谢上帝，如果我有些许天赋异禀，那就是众人所说的能将凡人夸上天界的本领，至于如何把天使贬至人间，诚如自己所坚信的那样，对此我一窍不通。</p>
<p>如果有人发现我在参议院的议席或其他任何地方对公众美德冷嘲热讽，仅仅是因为这美德恰好远离我的家乡或毗邻之地，如果我因为这番缘由，或是其他任何缘由，拒绝向美国的有识之士，向崇高的爱国情操，向为自由、为祖国抛头颅撒热血的献身精神表达由衷的敬意，如果当我看到不同凡俗的天赐英才、看到南部人民身上无与伦比的才能与德行时，出于地方主义偏见的动摇和州界攀比倾轧之风的腐蚀，而将其固有的品德与应得的声望减少一分一毫的话，那就让我的三寸之舌和上颚黏在一起，变成一个永远开不了口的哑巴。</p>
<p>总统先生，对于马萨诸塞州的赞美我将不再赘述。她不需要任何溢美之词。她的伟大，已然不言而喻；看看她，诸位请自行判断。她的历史就在那里；全世界已牢记在心。那些过往，至少都得以留存史册。那是波士顿，康科德，莱克星敦，邦克山；它们都将屹立千载，永垂不朽。先生，美国的自由精神在哪里发出第一声呐喊，它就在哪里获得滋养，日益茁壮，它依然存在，存在于势不可当的英雄气概中，依然焕发着最初的精神力量。如果倾轧与分裂会让它受到损伤，如果派系纷争与狼子野心会攻击毁灭它，如果愚蠢与疯狂，还有那蠢蠢欲动的不满情绪此消彼长、想让它和与之相辅相成的联邦分道扬镳，那它会挺立在哺育它的摇篮边上，用尽余力地向聚集在身边的朋友们伸出手臂；如果最后它注定倒下，那么它也必然倒在记载着他无上荣光的纪念碑间，倒在它发源的那片热土之上。</p>

<p>THE CHURCH SCENE FROM EVANGELINE</p>
<p>伊凡吉林眼中的教堂一幕</p>
<p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, 1807-1882, the son of Hon. Stephen
Longfellow, an eminent lawyer of Portland, Maine, was born in that city.
He graduated, at the age of eighteen, at Bowdoin College. He was soon
appointed to the chair of Modern Languages and Literature in that
institution, and, to fit himself further for his work, he went abroad
and spent four years in Europe. He remained at Bowdoin till 1835, when
he was appointed to the chair of Modern Languages and Belles-lettres in
Harvard University. On receiving this appointment, he again went to
Europe and remained two years. He resigned his professorship in 1854,
and after that time resided in Cambridge, pursuing his literary labors
and giving to the public, from time to time, the fruits of his pen. In
1868 he made a voyage to England, where he was received with
extraordinary marks of honor and esteem. In addition to Mr. Longfellow’s
original works, both in poetry and in prose, he distinguished himself by
several translations; the most famous is that of the works of Dante.</p>
<p>Mr. Longfellow’s poetry is always elegant and chaste, showing in
every line traces of his careful scholarship. Yet it is not above the
popular taste or comprehension, as is shown by the numerous and varied
editions of his poems. Many of his poems treat of historical themes;
“Evangeline,” from which the following selection is taken, is esteemed
by many as the most beautiful of all his longer poems; it was first
published in 1847.</p>
<p>So passed the morning away. And lo! with a summons sonorous</p>
<p>Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drumbeat.</p>
<p>Thronged erelong was the church with men. Without, in the
churchyard,</p>
<p>Awaited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the
headstones</p>
<p>Garlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.</p>
<p>Then came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among
them</p>
<p>Entered the sacred portal. With loud and dissonant clangor</p>
<p>Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and
casement,—</p>
<p>Echoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal</p>
<p>Closed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the
soldiers.</p>
<p>Then uprose their commander, and spake from the steps of the
altar,</p>
<p>Holding aloft in his hands, with its seals, the royal commission.</p>
<p>“You have convened this day,” he said, “by his Majesty’s orders.</p>
<p>Clement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his
kindness,</p>
<p>Let your own hearts reply! To my natural make and my temper</p>
<p>Painful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous.</p>
<p>Yet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will of our monarch;</p>
<p>Namely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all
kinds</p>
<p>Forfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from this
province</p>
<p>Be transported to other lands. God grant you may dwell there</p>
<p>Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!</p>
<p>Prisoners now I declare you; for such is his Majesty’s pleasure!”</p>
<p>As, when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer,</p>
<p>Suddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones</p>
<p>Beats down the farmer’s corn in the field and shatters his
windows,</p>
<p>Hiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house
roofs,</p>
<p>Bellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their inclosure;</p>
<p>So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the
speaker.</p>
<p>Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose</p>
<p>Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,</p>
<p>And, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the doorway.</p>
<p>Vain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations</p>
<p>Rang through the house of prayer; and high o’er the heads of the
others</p>
<p>Rose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,</p>
<p>As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows.</p>
<p>Flushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he
shouted,—</p>
<p>“Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them
allegiance!</p>
<p>Death to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our
harvests!”</p>
<p>More he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier</p>
<p>Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement.</p>
<p>In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,</p>
<p>Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician</p>
<p>Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the alter.</p>
<p>Raising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence</p>
<p>All that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people;</p>
<p>Deep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful</p>
<p>Spake he, as, after the tocsin’s alarum, distinctly the clock
strikes.</p>
<p>“What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized
you?</p>
<p>Forty years of my life have I labored among you, and taught you,</p>
<p>Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!</p>
<p>Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and
privations?</p>
<p>Have you so soon forgotten all the lessons of love and
forgiveness?</p>
<p>This is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane
it</p>
<p>Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred?</p>
<p>Lo! where the crucified Christ from his cross is gazing upon you!</p>
<p>See! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion!</p>
<p>Hark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, ‘O Father, forgive
them!’</p>
<p>Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,</p>
<p>Let us repeat it now, and say, ‘O Father, forgive them.’”</p>
<p>Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his
people</p>
<p>Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate
outbreak,</p>
<p>While they repeated his prayer, and said, “O Father, forgive
them!”</p>

<p>全部没收，而你们本人也将离开这里，</p>
<p>被遣送到另一个地方，上帝许你们住在那里</p>
<p>永远做他忠心的臣民，知足快乐，恭顺祥和，</p>
<p>现在我宣布你们为阶下囚，因为这是陛下的旨意。”</p>
<p>正当暑热难消，天气一片晴好，</p>
<p>突然间狂风暴雨集结而来，要命的冰雹</p>
<p>摇晃着农夫的窗棂，将他田里的庄稼击倒，</p>
<p>遮住了太阳，把屋顶茅草吹落一地，乱七八糟，</p>
<p>它咆哮着卷起畜群，试图摧毁他们的畜栏；</p>
<p>人们在心里把统帅的话慢慢消化。</p>
<p>他们沉默片刻，震惊得说不出话，然后他们发出了</p>
<p>一声高过一声的号哭，悲愤交加，</p>
<p>冲动之下，他们发了疯似的冲向门口。</p>
<p>逃跑的希望渺茫；歇斯底里的哭喊咒骂</p>
<p>在祈祷者的殿堂里回响；一个高过他人的身影</p>
<p>站了起来，他高举着双臂，那是铁匠巴兹尔，</p>
<p>他像是风雨交加的海面上，一根被巨浪托起的桅杆。</p>
<p>他满脸潮红，怒火烧得他的脸扭曲变样；他疯狂地喊道，——</p>
<p>“打倒英格兰暴君！我们从来没有发誓为他效忠！</p>
<p>让那些外国士兵见鬼去吧，他们侵占了我们的房屋，霸占了我们的庄稼！”</p>
<p>他还有一肚子话要说，但是士兵伸出了无情的手，</p>
<p>狠狠甩了他一巴掌，然后把他拽倒在通道上。</p>
<p>群情激愤，众怒难消，就在混乱交战中，</p>
<p>看！高坛的门开了，费里西安神父</p>
<p>走了进来，他步态凝重，踏上了祭坛的台阶。</p>
<p>抬起他万众景仰的手，威严地示意</p>
<p>所有喧嚣的人安静下来；然后他开口；</p>
<p>他的声音低沉肃然；他的语调沉稳哀伤</p>
<p>如同尖利的警报过后，醇厚的钟声缓缓地敲响。</p>
<p>“你们想要做什么？我的孩子们！是什么样的疯狂让你们走火入魔？</p>
<p>我在你们中间工作了四十年，我曾经教过你们</p>
<p>彼此关爱，这话不仅仅只挂在嘴上，而是要真切地付诸行动</p>
<p>难道这就是我多年辛苦，不眠不休，不住祷告，坚守清贫的结果？</p>
<p>你们这么快就忘记了所有爱与宽恕的教谕了吗？</p>
<p>这里是耶稣基督的圣殿，难道你们真的要用</p>
<p>暴力的行径和充满仇恨的心去亵渎这神圣的地方？</p>
<p>看！被钉在十字架上的耶稣正在那里看着你们！</p>
<p>看吧！那双忧伤的眼睛里充满着怎样的温情与悲悯！</p>
<p>听！在他的唇际依旧重复着那句祷告：‘主啊，请宽恕他们吧。’”</p>
<p>他的话语里没有非难与责备，却字字句句直至心扉，</p>
<p>当他们重复着他的祷告，念着，“主啊，请宽恕他们吧！”</p>
<p>悔悟的抽噎取代了愤怒的爆发。</p>

<p>SONG OF THE SHIRT</p>
<p>衬衫之歌</p>
<p>Thomas Hood, 1798-1845, the son of a London bookseller, was born in
that city. He undertook, after leaving school, to learn the art of an
engraver, but soon gave up the business, and turned his attention to
literature. His lighter pieces, exhibiting his skill as a wit and
punster, soon became well known and popular. In 1821 he became subeditor
of the “London Magazine,” and formed the acquaintance of the literary
men of the metropolis. The last years of his life were clouded by
poverty and ill health. Some of his most humorous pieces were written on
a sick bed. Hood is best known as a joker—a writer of “whims and
oddities” —but he was no mere joker. Some of his pieces are filled with
the tenderest pathos; and a gentle spirit, in love with justice and
humanity, pervades even his lighter compositions. His “Song of the
Shirt” first appeared in the “London Punch.”</p>
<p>With fingers weary and worn,</p>
<p>With eyelids heavy and red,</p>
<p>A woman sat, in unwomanly rags,</p>
<p>Plying her needle and thread:</p>
<p>Stitch! stitch! stitch!</p>
<p>In poverty, hunger, and dirt,</p>
<p>And still with a voice of dolorous pitch,</p>
<p>She sang the “Song of the Shirt!”</p>
<p>“Work! work! work!</p>
<p>While the cock is crowing aloof!</p>
<p>And work! work! work!</p>
<p>Till the stars shine through the roof!</p>
<p>It is oh to be a slave</p>
<p>Along with the barbarous Turk,</p>
<p>Where woman has never a soul to save,</p>
<p>If this is Christian work!</p>
<p>“Work! work! work!</p>

<p>But human creatures’ lives!</p>

<p>In poverty, hunger, and dirt,—</p>
<p>Sewing at once, with a double thread,</p>
<p>A shroud as well as a shirt.</p>

<p>A crust of bread—and rags,</p>
<p>That shattered roof—and this naked floor—</p>
<p>A table—a broken chair—</p>
<p>And a wall so blank, my shadow I thank</p>
<p>For sometimes falling there.</p>
<p>“Work! work! work!</p>
<p>From weary chime to chime!</p>

<p>As prisoners work for crime!</p>
<p>Band, and gusset, and seam,</p>
<p>Seam, and gusset, and band,</p>
<p>Till the heart is sick, and the brain benumbed,</p>
<p>As well as the weary hand.</p>
<p>“Work! work! work!</p>
<p>In the dull December light,</p>
<p>And work! work! work!</p>
<p>When the weather is warm and bright;</p>
<p>While underneath the eaves</p>
<p>The brooding swallows cling,</p>
<p>As if to show me their sunny backs,</p>
<p>And twit me with the spring.</p>
<p>“Oh but to breathe the breath</p>
<p>Of the cowslip and primrose sweet!</p>
<p>With the sky above my head,</p>
<p>And the grass beneath my feet!</p>
<p>For only one short hour</p>
<p>To feel as I used to feel,</p>
<p>Before I knew the woes of want,</p>
<p>And the walk that costs a meal!</p>
<p>“Oh but for one short hour,—</p>
<p>A respite, however brief!</p>
<p>No blessed leisure for love or hope,</p>
<p>But only time for grief!</p>
<p>A little weeping would ease my heart,</p>
<p>But in their briny bed</p>
<p>My tears must stop, for every drop</p>
<p>Hinders needle and thread.”</p>
<p>With fingers weary and worn,</p>
<p>With eyelids heavy and red,</p>
<p>A woman sat, in unwomanly rags,</p>
<p>Plying her needle and thread:</p>
<p>Stitch! stitch! stitch!</p>
<p>In poverty, hunger, and dirt,</p>
<p>And still with a voice of dolorous pitch—</p>
<p>Would that its tone could reach the rich!</p>

<p>DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND</p>
<p>棋逢对手</p>
<p>Edouard Rene Lefebvre-Laboulaye, 1811-1883, was a French writer of
note. Most of his works involve questions of law and politics, and are
considered high authority on the questions discussed. A few works, such
as “Abdallah,” from which the following extract is adapted, were written
as a mere recreation in the midst of law studies; they show great
imaginative power. Laboulaye took great interest in the United States,
her people, and her literature; and many of his works are devoted to
American questions. He translated the works of Dr. William E. Channing
into French.</p>
<p>Mansour, the Egyptian merchant, one day repaired to the cadi on
account of a suit, the issue of which troubled him but little. A private
conversation with the judge had given him hopes of the justice of his
cause. The old man asked his son Omar to accompany him in order to
accustom him early to deal with the law.</p>
<p>The cadi was seated in the courtyard of the mosque. He was a fat,
good-looking man, who never thought, and talked little, which, added to
his large turban and his air of perpetual astonishment, gave him a great
reputation for justice and gravity.</p>
<p>The spectators were numerous; the principal merchants were seated on
the ground on carpets, forming a semicircle around the magistrate.
Mansour took his seat a little way from the sheik, and Omar placed
himself between the two, his curiosity strongly excited to see how the
law was obeyed, and how it was trifled with in case of need.</p>
<p>The first case called was that of a young Banian, as yellow as an
orange, with loose flowing robes and an effeminate air, who had lately
landed from India, and who complained of having been cheated by one of
Mansour’s rivals.</p>
<p>“Having found a casket of diamonds among the effects left by my
father,” said he, “I set out for Egypt, to live there on the proceeds of
their sale. I was obliged by bad weather to put into Jidda, where I soon
found myself in want of money. I went to the bazaar, and inquired for a
dealer in precious stones. The richest, I was told, was Mansour; the
most honest, Ali, the jeweler. I applied to Ali.</p>
<p>“He welcomed me as a son, as soon as he learned that I had diamonds
to sell, and carried me home with him. He gained my confidence by every
kind of attention, and advanced me all the money I needed. One day,
after dinner, at which wine was not wanting, he examined the diamonds,
one by one, and said, ‘My child, these diamonds are of little value; my
coffers are full of such stones. The rocks of the desert furnish them by
thousands.’</p>
<p>“To prove the truth of what he said, he opened a box, and, taking
therefrom a diamond thrice as large as any of mine, gave it to the slave
that was with me. ‘What will become of me?’ I cried; ‘I thought myself
rich, and here I am, poor, and a stranger.’</p>
<p>“‘My child,’ replied Ali, ‘Leave this casket with me, and I will give
you a price for it such as no one else would offer. Choose whatever you
wish in Jidda, and in two hours I will give you an equal weight of what
you have chosen in exchange for your Indian stones.’</p>
<p>“On returning home, night brought reflection. I learned that Ali had
been deceiving me. What he had given to the slave was nothing but a bit
of crystal. I demanded my casket. Ali refused to restore it. Venerable
magistrate, my sole hope is in your justice.”</p>
<p>It was now Ali’s turn to speak. “Illustrious cadi,” said he, “It is
true that we made a bargain, which I am ready to keep, The rest of the
young man’s story is false. What matters it what I gave the slave? Did I
force the stranger to leave the casket in my hands? Why does he accuse
me of treachery? Have I broken my word, and has he kept his?”</p>
<p>“Young man,” said the cadi to the Banian, “have you witnesses to
prove that Ali deceived you? If not, I shall put the accused on his
oath, as the law decrees.” A Koran was brought. Ali placed his hand on
it, and swore three times that he had not deceived the stranger.
“Wretch,” said the Banian, “thou art among those whose feet go down to
destruction. Thou hast thrown away thy soul.”</p>
<p>Omar smiled, and while Ali was enjoying the success of his ruse, he
approached the stranger, and asked, “Do you wish me to help you gain the
suit?” “Yes,” was the reply; “but you are only a child—you can do
nothing.”</p>
<p>“Have confidence in me a few moments,” said Omar; “accept Ali’s
bargain; let me choose in your stead, and fear nothing.”</p>
<p>The stranger bowed his head, and murmured, “What can I fear after
having lost all?” Then, turning to the cadi, and bowing respectfully,
“Let the bargain be consummated,” said he, “since the law decrees it,
and let this young man choose in my stead what I shall receive in
payment.”</p>
<p>A profound silence ensued. Omar rose, and, bowing to the cadi, “Ali,”
said he to the jeweler, “you have doubtless brought the casket, and can
tell us the weight thereof.”</p>
<p>“Here it is,” said Ali; “it weighs twenty pounds. Choose what you
will; if the thing asked for is in Jidda, you shall have it within two
hours, otherwise the bargain is null and void.”</p>
<p>“What we desire,” said Omar, raising his voice, “is ants’ wings, half
male and half female. You have two hours in which to furnish the twenty
pounds you have promised us.” “This is absurd,” cried the jeweler; “it
is impossible. I should need half a score of persons and six months
labor to satisfy so foolish a demand.”</p>
<p>“Are there any winged ants in Jidda?” asked the cadi. “Of course,”
answered the merchants, laughing; “they are one of the plagues of Egypt.
Our houses are full of them, and it would be doing us a great service to
rid us of them.”</p>
<p>“Then Ali must keep his promise or give back the casket,” said the
cadi. “This young man was mad to sell his diamonds weight for weight; he
is mad to exact such payment. So much the better for Ali the first time:
so much the worse for him the second. Justice has not two weights and
measures. Every bargain holds good before the law. Either furnish twenty
pounds of ants’ wings, or restore the casket to the Banian.” “A
righteous judgment,” shouted the spectators, wonder-struck at such
equity.</p>
<p>The stranger, beside himself with joy, took from the casket three
diamonds of the finest water; he forced them on Omar, who put them in
his girdle, and seated himself by his father, his gravity unmoved by the
gaze of the assembly. “Well done,” said Mansour; “but it is my turn now;
mark me well, and profit by the lesson I shall give you. Stop, young
man!” he cried to the Banian, “we have an account to settle.”</p>
<p>“The day before yesterday,” continued he, “this young man entered my
shop, and, bursting into tears, kissed my hand and entreated me to sell
him a necklace which I had already sold to the Pasha of Egypt, saying
that his life and that of a lady depended upon it. ‘Ask of me what you
will, my father,’ said he,”but I must have these gems or die.”</p>
<p>“I have a weakness for young men, and, though I knew the danger of
disappointing my master the pasha, I was unable to resist his
supplications. ‘Take the necklace,’ said I to him, ‘but promise to give
whatever I may ask in exchange.’ ‘My head itself, if you will,’ he
replied, ‘for you have saved my life,’ We were without witnesses, but,”
added Mansour, turning to the Banian, “is not my story true?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the young man, “and I beg your pardon for not having
satisfied you sooner: you know the cause. Ask of me what you
desire.”</p>
<p>“What I desire,” said Mansour, “is the casket with all its contents.
Illustrious magistrate, you have declared that all bargains hold good
before the law; this young man has promised to give me what I please;
now I declare that nothing pleases me but these diamonds.”</p>
<p>The cadi raised his head and looked about the assembly, as if to
interrogate the faces, then stroked his beard, and relapsed into his
meditations.</p>
<p>“Ali is defeated,” said the sheik to Omar, with a smile, “The fox is
not yet born more cunning than the worthy Mansour.”</p>
<p>“I am lost!” cried the Banian. “O Omar, have you saved me only to
cast me down from the highest pinnacle of joy to the depths of despair?
Persuade your father to spare me, that I may owe my life to you a second
time.”</p>
<p>“Well, my son,” said Mansour, “doubtless you are shrewd, but this
will teach you that your father knows rather more than you do. The cadi
is about to decide: try whether you can dictate his decree.”</p>
<p>“It is mere child’s play,” answered Omar, shrugging his shoulders;
“but since you desire it, my father, you shall lose your suit.” He rose,
and taking a piaster from his girdle, put it into the hand of the
Banian, who laid it before the judge.</p>
<p>“Illustrious cadi,” said Omar, “this young man is ready to fulfill
his engagement. This is what he offers Mansour—piaster. In itself this
coin is of little value; but examine it closely, and you will see that
it is stamped with the likeness of the sultan, our glorious master. May
God destroy and confound all who disobey his highness!</p>
<p>“It is this precious likeness that we offer you,” added he, turning
to Mansour; “if it pleases you, you are paid; to say that it displeases
you is an insult to the pasha, a crime punishable by death; and I am
sure that our worthy cadi will not become your accomplice—he who has
always been and always will be the faithful servant of an the
sultans.”</p>
<p>When Omar had finished speaking, all eyes turned toward the cadi,
who, more impenetrable than ever, stroked his face and waited for the
old man to come to his aid. Mansour was agitated and embarrassed. The
silence of the cadi and the assembly terrified him, and he cast a
supplicating glance toward his son.</p>
<p>“My father,” said Omar, “permit this young man to thank you for the
lesson of prudence which you have given him by frightening him a little.
He knows well that it was you who sent me to his aid, and that all this
is a farce. No one is deceived by hearing the son oppose the Father, and
who has ever doubted Mansour’s experience and generosity?”</p>
<p>“No one,” interrupted the cadi, starting up like a man suddenly
awakened from a dream, “and I least of all; and this is why I have
permitted you to speak, my young Solomon. I wished to honor in you the
wisdom of your father; but another time avoid meddling with his
highness’s name; it is not safe to sport with the lion’s paws. The
matter is settled. The necklace is worth a hundred thousand piasters, is
it not, Mansour? This madcap, shall give you, therefore, a hundred
thousand piasters, and all parties will be satisfied.”</p>

<p>曼苏尔是个埃及商人，有一天为了一桩让他有点头痛的诉讼来到了法官那里。经过私下和法官沟通后，他觉得他的诉求颇有希望。老人让他的儿子奥马尔与他一同前往，好让儿子见见世面，知道打官司究竟是怎么回事。</p>
<p>法官端坐在清真寺的庭院中。他体型魁梧，相貌堂堂，不爱动脑，惜字如金，加上他头上缠绕的巨大头巾和脸上一成不变的错愕神情，给他平添了一副公正严明、不苟言笑的模样。</p>
<p>旁听者黑压压来了一片；几个位高权重的商人围着法官排成了半圆，坐在地毯上。曼苏尔挑了一个离族长略远的地方坐下，奥马尔则在他们中间落座，他很好奇，急不可耐地想见识一下人们究竟如何遵循法律，而一旦有不时之需，人们又会如何轻贱法律。</p>
<p>第一个案子是由一个年轻的印度商人提起的诉讼，他的肤色黄得如同一枚橙子，身上的长袍晃晃荡荡，整个人看上去阳刚不足，阴柔有余。年轻人刚从印度过来，他控告曼苏尔的竞争对手欺骗了他。</p>
<p>“我在父亲留下的财产中找到了一匣钻石，”他说，“然后我来到埃及，想把他们卖了以谋生计。途中遭遇恶劣天气，于是只好滞留在吉达，这时我发现身上带的钱已所剩无几。我来到集市，想四处打听一番，好找一个珠宝代理商。我得知这儿最富有的珠宝商是曼苏尔；最诚实可靠的是阿里。于是我打定主意，选择了阿里。</p>
<p>当他得知我想出售钻石时，立刻拿出对待子侄般的热情欢迎我，并邀请我和他一同回家。他的无微不至打消了我的不安，他还预支给我急需的钱款。一天晚上，酒足饭饱后，他逐一查验了我的钻石，然后开口说，‘我的孩子，这些钻石一钱不值；我箱子里头有大把大把这样的石头。沙漠的岩石里从不缺这种东西。’</p>
<p>为了证明他所言不虚，他打开一个盒子，从那里拿出一颗钻石，个头比我的那些足足大了三倍，然后随手交给了我的仆人。‘我该怎么办？’我哭喊道，‘我还以为自己成了富翁，可原来不过是个穷困潦倒的外乡人。’</p>
<p>‘我的孩子，’阿里回答，‘把你的匣子留下吧，没有人会比我开更高的价了。你可以在吉达境内任意挑选一样东西，你这个匣子有多重，两个小时内我就会以相同的重量集满你所挑选的东西，以此来交换你的印度石头。’</p>
<p>等回到住所，夜晚降临时我才回过神来。我幡然醒悟，阿里欺骗了我。他给我仆人的东西不过是块水晶。我想要回我的匣子。阿里断然拒绝。尊敬的长官，请您为我做主，求您为我主持公道。”</p>
<p>轮到阿里开口了。“英明无上的长官，”他说，“我们确实做了笔交易，而且我说过的就会做到，至于这位年轻人之后所说的，那纯属无稽之谈。我给了他仆人什么东西和整件事有什么关系呢？难道是我强迫这位异乡人把匣子放在我手中的吗？他为何要控诉我背信弃义？难道是我言而无信，他倒是信守承诺了？”</p>
<p>“年轻人，”法官对印度小伙说，“你有没有证人能证明阿里骗了你？如果没有，那我只好依照法律程序以被告的誓词来做裁决了。”《古兰经》搬了上来。阿里把手放在上面，一连发了三遍誓，说自己没有行骗。“卑鄙小人，”印度商人说，“万劫不复的人里肯定少不了你。你把你的灵魂丢给狗吃了。”</p>
<p>奥马尔笑了，就在阿里为自己诡计得逞而沾沾自喜的时候，他走到异乡人面前，问道：“你想不想让我帮你打赢这场官司？”“我当然想，”异乡人回答，“可是你只是个孩子——你帮不上忙的。”</p>
<p>“给我点时间，对我有点信心，”奥马尔说：“接受阿里的协议；我来替你选择，别担心。”</p>
<p>异乡人垂着头，喃喃自语道，“我已经失去一切了，还有什么好担心呢？”然后，他转身面向法官，恭敬地鞠了一躬，“就让我和阿里按协议完成交易吧，”他说，“既然法律这样明文规定了，请让这个年轻人来替我选择交换钻石的报偿吧。”</p>
<p>底下一片寂静。奥马尔站起身，向法官鞠躬致意，“阿里，”他对珠宝商说，“你肯定带来了那个珠宝匣，那就请告诉我们它的分量吧。”</p>
<p>“匣子就在这儿，”阿里说，“它有二十磅重。你随便选一样东西，只要东西在吉达，两个小时内你就能拿到手，如果你拿不到，我们的这笔交易就一笔勾销。”</p>
<p>“我们想要的，”奥马尔提高了嗓门说，“是蚂蚁的翅膀，一半来自雄蚂蚁，另一半来自雌蚂蚁。你有两个小时时间来备齐二十磅蚂蚁翅膀，就如你答应我们的那样。”“这太荒诞了，”珠宝商叫道，“这怎么可能办到。我得有十个帮手，花上六个月的时间才能满足这么一个可笑的要求。”</p>
<p>“吉达有长着翅膀的蚂蚁吗？”法官问。“当然有了，”商人们边笑边答，“这可是埃及最让人头疼的特产之一了。我们的屋子里全是它们的影子，要是能帮我们消灭它们，那真是件功德无量的大好事啊。”</p>
<p>“那阿里就必须兑现承诺，要不就得归还珠宝匣，”法官说。“按重量卖钻石，这个年轻人真是疯了；索要这样的报偿，他脑袋确实不正常。前一条能让阿里占大便宜，后一条对阿里非常不利。公正从来没有双重标准。在法律面前每条协议都有效。你要么准备二十磅的蚂蚁翅膀，要么就将珠宝匣还给印度商人。”</p>
<p>“真是公正无私的审判。”旁听者们欢呼道，对这一裁决惊叹不已。</p>
<p>异乡人无比欣喜地从珠宝匣里挑了三颗泉水般清澈透亮的钻石，塞到奥马尔手中，后者将钻石放入褡裢，而后坐在了他父亲身旁，他一脸庄重，丝毫没有受到四面八方眼光的影响。“干得好，”曼苏尔说：“不过，现在到我了；看好了，我要给你上一课，你仔细学着点。慢着，年轻人！”他对印度商人喊道，“我们之间还有账没算完。”</p>
<p>“就在前天，”他接着说道，“这个年轻人走进我的店铺，突然之间泪如雨下，他亲吻了我的手，并一再恳求我把已经出售给埃及巴夏的项链卖给他，说这关乎他的和一位小姐的性命。‘尊敬的先生，您可以要我身上任何东西，’他说，‘但我必须拿到这条项链，否则我会没命的。’</p>
<p>“年轻人的话让我于心不忍，虽然我知道让我的主人巴夏失望有多冒险，可我无法拒绝他的请求。‘把项链拿走吧，’我对他说，‘但得保证我要什么你就得给什么，以此作为交换。’’若是愿意，您可以取走我的首级，’他答道，’因为您是我的救命恩人，’不过，我们没有证人。”曼苏尔说着，转向印度商人，“我所说的是不是真的？”</p>
<p>“是的，”年轻人说，“请宽恕我没有尽早满足您：您是知道其中缘故的。现在请告诉我您想要什么。”</p>
<p>“我想要的，”曼苏尔说，“就是这个匣子加上里头的东西。英明无上的法官，您说过法律面前所有协议都有效；这个年轻人答应过给我想要的一切；现在我宣布除了这些钻石，我别无所求。”</p>
<p>法官抬起头，看了看在座的旁听者，好像在询问他们的意见，然后他摸了摸自己的胡须，重新陷入沉思中。</p>
<p>“阿里输了官司，”族长面带微笑对奥马尔说，“要论精明狡猾，这世上还有谁比得上你父亲曼苏尔呢。”</p>
<p>“我该怎么做！”印度商人叫道。“哦，奥马尔，你出手搭救难道就是为了让我从喜悦的峰尖跌到绝望的谷底吗？请说服你的父亲高抬贵手，我会为此欠你第二条性命。”</p>
<p>“好吧，我的儿子，”曼苏尔说，“毫无疑问你很聪明，但这次就是让你记住你父亲的精明远胜于你。法官马上就要打定主意了：试试看你能不能预测他的判决。”</p>
<p>“这不过是孩子玩的把戏，”奥马尔耸耸肩膀说：“但既然这就是你想要的，父亲，那你可就要输掉这场官司了。”他站起来，从他褡裢里掏出一枚比索，把它放到印度商人的手中，商人转手将钱币放在法官面前。</p>
<p>“英明无上的法官，”奥马尔说，“这个年轻人已经准备好要兑现他的诺言了。这就是他给曼苏尔的东西——一枚比索。钱币本身值不了多少钱；但是凑近好好看一看，你会发现上面印着的头像和我们伟大的君主苏丹极为相似。愿上帝让那些漠视他尊荣的家伙都下地狱吧。”</p>
<p>“这就是我们要给你的，印着苏丹头像的宝贵的钱币，”他边说，边转向曼苏尔，“如果它是你想要的，那么你就算收到了报偿；如果它不是你想要的，那对巴夏就是一种侮辱，是一桩死罪；我敢肯定，我们伟大的法官不会成为你的帮凶——一直以来他都是，而且会永远是苏丹忠心不贰的臣子。”</p>
<p>奥马尔说完后，所有人的目光都落在了法官身上，他看上去比任何时候更让人捉摸不透，他摩挲着自己的脸，等着族长施以援手。曼苏尔既焦躁又尴尬。法官和旁听席上的沉默让他心里发虚，于是他向他儿子投去了求饶的一瞥。</p>
<p>“我的父亲，”奥马尔说，“就让这个年轻人感谢您教会了他什么叫深谋远虑吧，虽然教授的过程中您让他受了些许惊吓。他很清楚，是您把我派到他身边救他于危难，刚才的一切不过是场玩笑。有谁相信儿子会和老子对着干，又有谁会怀疑曼苏尔的见多识广和慷慨大方呢？”</p>
<p>“没有人，”法官突然插嘴进来，像是刚从梦中惊醒一般忽地站起身来，“至少我不会；而这也是为何我会允许你发言的原因，我年轻的所罗门。你的智慧得益于你的父亲，我要向这份智慧致敬；不过下次可别以下犯上，老虎嘴上拔须可是件危险事。一切都有了定论。项链价值十万比索，对不对，曼苏尔？这个莽撞小伙因此得付给你十万比索，好啦，这下可算是皆大欢喜了。”</p>

<p>To him who in the love of Nature holds</p>
<p>Communion with her visible forms, she speaks</p>
<p>A various language: for his gayer hours</p>
<p>She has a voice of gladness, and a smile</p>
<p>And eloquence of beauty; and she glides</p>
<p>Into his darker musings, with a mild</p>
<p>And healing sympathy, that steals away</p>
<p>Their sharpness, ere he is aware.</p>
<p>When thoughts</p>
<p>Of the last hitter hour come like a blight</p>
<p>Over thy spirit, and sad images</p>
<p>Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,</p>
<p>And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,</p>
<p>Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;—</p>
<p>Go forth, under the open sky, and list</p>
<p>To Nature’s teachings, while from all around—</p>
<p>Earth and her waters, and the depths of air—</p>
<p>Comes a still voice,—</p>
<p>Yet a few days, and thee</p>
<p>The all-beholding sun shall see no more</p>
<p>In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,</p>
<p>Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,</p>
<p>Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist</p>
<p>Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim</p>
<p>Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again;</p>
<p>And, lost each human trace, surrendering up</p>
<p>Thine individual being, shalt thou go</p>
<p>To mix forever with the elements;</p>
<p>To be a brother to the insensible rock</p>
<p>And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain</p>
<p>Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak</p>
<p>Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.</p>
<p>Yet not to thine eternal resting place</p>
<p>Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish</p>
<p>Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down</p>
<p>With patriarchs of the infant world,—with kings,</p>
<p>The powerful of the earth,—the wise, the good,</p>
<p>Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,—</p>
<p>All in one mighty sepulcher.</p>
<p>The hills,</p>
<p>Rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun; the vales</p>
<p>Stretching in pensive quietness between;</p>
<p>The venerable woods; rivers that move</p>
<p>In majesty, and the complaining brooks,</p>
<p>That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,</p>
<p>Old Ocean’s gray and melancholy waste,—</p>
<p>Are but the solemn decorations all</p>
<p>Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,</p>
<p>The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,</p>
<p>Are shining on the sad abodes of death,</p>
<p>Through the still lapse of ages.</p>
<p>All that tread</p>
<p>The globe are but a handful to the tribes</p>
<p>That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings</p>
<p>Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,</p>
<p>Or lose thyself in the continuous woods</p>
<p>Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound</p>
<p>Save his own dashings,—yet the dead are there:</p>
<p>And millions in those solitudes, since first</p>
<p>The flight of years began, have laid them down</p>
<p>In their last sleep,—the dead reign there alone.</p>
<p>So shalt thou rest; and what if thou withdraw</p>
<p>In silence from the living, and no friend</p>
<p>Take note of thy departure? All that breathe</p>
<p>Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh</p>
<p>When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care</p>
<p>Plod on, and each one as before will chase</p>
<p>His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave</p>
<p>Their mirth and their employments, and shall come</p>
<p>And make their bed with thee. As the long train</p>
<p>Of ages glide away, the sons of men—</p>
<p>The youth in life’s green spring, and he who goes</p>
<p>In the full strength of years, matron and maid,</p>
<p>The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man</p>
<p>Shall one by one be gathered to thy side</p>
<p>By those who in their turn shall follow them.</p>
<p>So live, that when thy summons comes to join</p>
<p>The innumerable caravan, which moves</p>
<p>To that mysterious realm, where each shall take</p>
<p>His chamber in the silent halls of death,</p>
<p>Thou go not, like the quarry slave at night,</p>
<p>Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed</p>
<p>By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,</p>
<p>Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch</p>

<p>INDIAN JUGGLERS</p>
<p>印度杂耍艺人</p>
<p>William Hazlitt, 1778-1830, was born in Maidstone, England. His
father was a Unitarian clergyman, and he was sent to a college of that
denomination to be educated for the ministry; but having a greater taste
for art than theology, he resolved, on leaving school, to devote himself
to painting. He succeeded so well in his efforts as to meet the warmest
commendation of his friends, but did not succeed in satisfying his own
fastidious taste. On this account he threw away his pencil and took up
his pen. His works, though numerous, are, with the exception of a life
of Napoleon, chiefly criticisms on literature and art.</p>
<p>Hazlitt is thought to have treated his contemporaries with an unjust
severity; but his genial appreciation of the English classics, and the
thorough and loving manner in which he discusses their merits, make his
essays the delight of every lover of those perpetual wellsprings of
intellectual pleasure. His “Table Talk,” “Characters of Shakespeare’s
Plays,” “Lectures on the English Poets,” and “Lectures on the Literature
of the Elizabethan Age,” are the works that exhibit his style and
general merits in their most favorable light.</p>
<p>Coming forward and seating himself on the ground, in his white dress
and tightened turban, the chief of the Indian jugglers begins with
tossing up two brass balls, which is what any of us could do, and
concludes by keeping up four at the same time, which is what none of us
could do to save our lives, not if we were to take our whole lives to do
it in.</p>
<p>Is it then a trifling power we see at work, or is it not something
next to miraculous? It is the utmost stretch of human ingenuity, which
nothing but the bending the faculties of body and mind to it from the
tenderest infancy with incessant, ever-anxious application up to
manhood, can accomplish or make even a slight approach to. Man, thou art
a wonderful animal, and thy ways past finding out! Thou canst do strange
things, but thou turnest them to small account!</p>
<p>To conceive of this extraordinary dexterity, distracts the
imagination and makes admiration breathless. Yet it costs nothing to the
performer, any more than if it were a mere mechanical deception with
which he had nothing to do, but to watch and laugh at the astonishment
of the spectators. A single error of a hair’s breadth, of the smallest
conceivable portion of time, would be fatal; the precision of the
movements must be like a mathematical truth; their rapidity is like
lightning.</p>
<p>To catch four balls in succession, in less than a second of time, and
deliver them back so as to return with seeming consciousness to the hand
again; to make them revolve around him at certain intervals, like the
planets in their spheres; to make them chase each other like sparkles of
fire, or shoot up like flowers or meteors; to throw them behind his
back, and twine them round his neck like ribbons, or like serpents; to
do what appears an impossibility, and to do it with all the ease, the
grace, the carelessness imaginable; to laugh at, to play with the
glittering mockeries, to follow them with his eye as if he could
fascinate them with its lambent fire, or as if he had only to see that
they kept time with the music on the stage—there is something in all
this which he who does not admire may be quite sure he never really
admired anything in the whole course of his life. It is skill
surmounting difficulty, and beauty triumphing over skill. It seems as if
the difficulty, once mastered, naturally resolved itself into ease and
grace, and as if, to be overcome at all, it must be overcome without an
effort. The smallest awkwardness or want of pliancy or self-possession
would stop the whole process. It is the work of witchcraft, and yet
sport for children.</p>
<p>Some of the other feats are quite as curious and wonderful—such as
the balancing the artificial tree, and shooting a bird from each branch
through a quill—though none of them have the elegance or facility of the
keeping up of the brass balls. You are in pain for the result, and glad
when the experiment is over; they are not accompanied with the same
unmixed, unchecked delight as the former; and I would not give much to
be merely astonished without being pleased at the same time. As to the
swallowing of the sword, the police ought to interfere to prevent
it.</p>
<p>When I saw the Indian juggler do the same things before, his feet
were bare, and he had large rings on his toes, which he kept turning
round all the time of the performance, as if they moved of
themselves.</p>
<p>The hearing a speech in Parliament drawled or stammered out by the
honorable member or the noble lord, the ringing the changes on their
commonplaces, which anyone could repeat after them as well as they,
stirs me not a jot,—shakes not my good opinion of myself. I ask what
there is that I can do as well as this. Nothing. What have I been doing
all my life? Have I been idle, or have I nothing to show for all my
labor and pains? Or have I passed my time in pouring words like water
into empty sieves, rolling a stone up a hill and then down again, trying
to prove an argument in the teeth of facts, and looking for causes in
the dark, and not finding them? Is there no one thing in which I can
challenge competition, that I can bring as an instance of exact
perfection, in which others can not find a flaw?</p>
<p>The utmost I can pretend to is to write a description of what this
fellow can do. I can write a book: so can many others who have not even
learned to spell. What abortions are these essays! What errors, what
ill-pieced transitions, what crooked reasons, what lame conclusions! How
little is made out, and that little how ill! Yet they are the best I can
do.</p>
<p>I endeavor to recollect all I have ever heard or thought upon a
subject, and to express it as neatly as I can. Instead of writing on
four subjects at a time, it is as much as I can manage, to keep the
thread of one discourse clear and unentangled. I have also time on my
hands to correct my opinions and polish my periods; but the one I can
not, and the other I will not, do. I am fond of arguing; yet, with a
good deal of pains and practice, it is often much as I can do to beat my
man, though he may be a very indifferent hand. A common fencer would
disarm his adversary in the twinkling of an eye, unless he were a
professor like himself. A stroke of wit will sometimes produce this
effect, but there is no such power or superiority in sense or reasoning.
There is no complete mastery of execution to be shown there; and you
hardly know the professor from the impudent pretender or the mere
clown.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-523">中文阅读</h4>
<p>戏班子里的台柱子走上前，席地而坐，这个披着白袍、紧裹着头巾的印度杂耍艺人开始往上抛两个铜球，这是个任谁都会的把戏，接着铜球的数目增加到了四个，这一手如果不是花上一辈子，我们中间也许没人能学会，而我们没人会在四颗球上浪费时间。</p>
<p>那么，这到底算是一种不值一提的雕虫小技，还是离奇迹仅一步之遥的神奇能力？这种技能最大限度展现了人类的身心合一，它需要从身体柔韧度最佳的幼年开始外练肢体技艺，内修心智毅力，这番勤学苦练一直要持续到成年时期方能有所建树，若不然就算皮毛也不可能学到。人类，你确是自然界无与伦比的灵兽，你的举动让人捉摸不透！你可以掌握如此奇巧的技能，却把他们变成了雕虫小技。</p>
<p>只要一想到如何练就这份眼明手快，你就会不由地神思恍惚，惊叹之余忘了呼吸。可是对表演者而言这不过是小菜一碟，好像是一种机械重复的骗人把戏，除了看看观众，为他们目瞪口呆的表情感到暗暗好笑外，他显得有些百无聊赖。可实际上，只要表演过程中出现头发丝般的毫厘之差，时间的拿捏上有瞬间的不到位，对表演者而言可能就有性命之忧；他的一举一动必须像数学计算一般精准无误，身体的反应要像闪电一般迅速。</p>
<p>要在不及一秒钟的瞬间连续接住四颗球，再抛起来，让他们像有意识一般再度回到手中；每隔些许时间，叫他们环绕身侧，如同行星运行在固定的轨道；让他们你追我逐，像四处飞溅的火星，或者把他们接连向上抛射，如同升空的花朵抑或流星；然后又将他们扔到身后抛来抛去，像丝带或蛇一般缠绕在脖颈；这些在别人眼里匪夷所思的动作他却完成得不费吹灰之力，举手投足间，他尽显优雅，同时又带着几许漫不经心；他面带微笑从容表演着，脸上闪烁着嘲弄的神情，他的目光追随着翻飞的铜球，仿佛眼中的精光散发着让它们乖乖听命的魔力，又仿佛他只是在观察铜球的舞动和台上的音乐节奏是否合拍——这所有一切是那么神奇，如果有谁对此无动于衷，那么他这辈子肯定没有对其他任何事情欢呼叫好过。</p>
<p>这是技巧压倒了困难，而优美的艺术又超越了单纯的技巧。就好像困难一旦被征服，困难本身就会摇身一变成为优雅从容，又好像是只有做到举重若轻，不着痕迹，才能最终战胜困难。如果动作上有丝毫的不自然，或是有失柔软或沉着，那么整个表演就会被迫停下。在旁人眼中这像是一种不可思议的巫术，可在他手里轻而易举得如同孩子的游戏。</p>
<p>还有其他不俗的才艺，虽然都不如空中抛球那样优雅灵动，但也一样精彩，让人称奇，比如在让一棵人造树保持平衡的同时，用羽茎射落每根树枝上的小鸟。等待结果的时候你惴惴不安，直到尘埃落定，才感到轻松开心。看这些节目不像欣赏空中抛球那样能从头至尾感到一种纯粹的、抑制不住的喜悦；如果单单让人看得有惊无喜，那么这样的节目也算不得高明。像空口吞剑这样的表演要是让警察看到一定会被勒令停止。</p>
<p>从前看印度杂耍艺人表演空中抛球的时候，他总是打着赤脚，脚趾上套着几个大圆环，整场表演中他能让大圆环始终不停地旋转，就像是圆环有了意识、自顾自地转动起来一样。</p>
<p>听议会里那些达官显贵们慢条斯理或是磕磕巴巴地发言，听他们翻来覆去重复着任何人都能说得一样好的陈词滥调，我的心里没有丝毫触动——也无法动摇我良好的自我感觉。我问自己，有什么事我能完成得如同那印度杂耍一般无懈可击。没有。我这一生都做了些什么？是虚度了光阴，还是碌碌无为？也许我把时间浪费在了将语言如水一般倾倒在筛子上，推着石头滚上山，之后又看着它从另一边滚落，无视明摆的事实，妄图论证一个观点，试图在黑暗中寻求奋斗的目标却最终一无所获？难道就没有一件事能让我有恃无恐地向别人发起挑战，和他一较高下，能让我成为完美无缺的个中典范，让人就算想吹毛求疵也挑不出一丝毛病？</p>
<p>而我能自诩做得最好的一件事，莫过于描绘那个印度杂耍艺人的超凡技艺了。我会写作，可那些从未学过拼写的人也会。我写过的那些文章是多么的失败！其中有多少谬误，多少生硬的起承转合，多少讲不通的道理，多少站不住脚的结论！人们能够从中所获的少之又少，可即便是那么丁点儿收获也被我阐述得支离破碎！然而，我竭尽全力，也只能把文章写成这副模样。</p>
<p>就一个话题而言，我得先把我所听到的、想到的努力回忆一番，而后尽可能表述得有条有理。我没有本事同时写四件事情，力所能及的也只是梳理一件事情的线索，让它不至于显得夹杂不清。我手头有充裕的时间来修正我的观点，斟酌我的词句；然而前者我做不到，后者我不愿意。我喜欢辩论；然而经过一番勤学苦练，我要使出浑身解数才能将对方击败，可对方可能对输赢毫不在意。一个寻常的击剑手能在眨眼功夫让对手缴械投降，除非另一方也和他一样会舞刀弄剑。有时候一句充满智慧的妙语也会带来同样的效果，但是判断辨识或推理却没有这样强大的效力或优越性。人们无法驾轻就熟地运用自己的理智；你几乎无法辨明，一个人究竟是专业人士还是无耻的冒牌货或跳梁小丑。</p>

<p>ANTONY OVER CAESAR’S DEAD BODY</p>
<p>凯撒遗体前的安东尼</p>
<p>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears:</p>
<p>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</p>
<p>The evil that men do lives after them;</p>
<p>The good is oft interred with their bones;</p>
<p>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</p>
<p>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</p>
<p>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</p>
<p>And grievously hath Caesar answered it.</p>
<p>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest—</p>
<p>For Brutus is an honorable man;</p>
<p>So are they all, all honorable men—</p>
<p>Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.</p>
<p>He was my, friend, faithful and just to me:</p>
<p>But Brutus says he was ambitious;</p>
<p>And Brutus is an honorable man.</p>
<p>He hath brought many captives home to Rome,</p>
<p>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</p>
<p>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</p>
<p>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</p>
<p>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</p>
<p>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</p>
<p>And Brutus is an honorable man.</p>
<p>You all did see, that on the Lupercal,</p>
<p>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</p>
<p>Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?</p>
<p>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</p>
<p>And, sure, he is an honorable man.</p>
<p>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</p>
<p>But here I am to speak what I do know.</p>
<p>You all did love him once, not without cause;</p>
<p>What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?</p>
<p>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</p>
<p>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</p>
<p>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</p>
<p>And I must pause till it come back to me.</p>
<p>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</p>
<p>Have stood against the world; now lies he there,</p>
<p>And none so poor to do him reverence.</p>
<p>O masters! if I were disposed to stir</p>
<p>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</p>
<p>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</p>
<p>Who, you all know, are honorable men.</p>
<p>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</p>
<p>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</p>
<p>Than I will wrong such honorable men.</p>
<p>But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</p>
<p>I found it in his closet; ’t is his will:</p>
<p>Let but the commons hear this testament—</p>
<p>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read—</p>
<p>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds,</p>
<p>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;</p>
<p>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</p>
<p>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</p>
<p>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</p>
<p>Unto their issue.</p>
<p>Citizen . We’ll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>All . The will, the will; we will hear Caesar’s will.</p>
<p>Ant . Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;</p>
<p>It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.</p>
<p>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;</p>
<p>And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,</p>
<p>It will inflame you, it will make you mad;</p>
<p>’T is good you know not that you are his heirs;</p>
<p>For, if you should, Oh what would come of it!</p>
<p>Cit . Read the will; we’ll hear it, Antony;</p>
<p>You shall read the will, Caesar’s will.</p>
<p>Ant . Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?</p>
<p>I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it:</p>
<p>I fear I wrong the honorable men</p>
<p>Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it.</p>
<p>Cit . They were traitors: honorable men!</p>
<p>All . The will! the testament!</p>
<p>Ant . You will compel me, then, to read the will?</p>
<p>Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,</p>
<p>And let me show you him that made the will.</p>
<p>(He comes down from the pulpit.)</p>
<p>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</p>
<p>You all do know this mantle: I remember</p>
<p>The first time ever Caesar put it on;</p>
<p>’T was on a summer’s evening, in his tent,</p>
<p>That day he overcame the Nervii;</p>
<p>Look! in this place, ran Cassius’ dagger through:</p>
<p>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</p>
<p>Through this, the well belove’d Brutus stabbed;</p>
<p>And, as he plucked his cursed steel away,</p>
<p>Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,</p>
<p>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</p>
<p>If Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no;</p>
<p>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel:</p>
<p>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</p>
<p>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</p>
<p>For, when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</p>
<p>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,</p>
<p>Quite vanquished him: then burst his mighty heart;</p>
<p>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</p>
<p>Even at the base of Pompey’s statua,</p>
<p>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</p>
<p>Oh, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</p>
<p>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</p>
<p>Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.</p>
<p>Oh, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel</p>
<p>The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.</p>
<p>Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</p>
<p>Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,</p>
<p>Here is himself, marred, as you see, with traitors.</p>
<p>1st Cit . O piteous spectacle!</p>
<p>2d Cit . O noble Caesar!</p>
<p>3d Cit . We will be revenged!</p>
<p>All . Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire!</p>
<p>Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live.</p>
<p>Ant . Stay, countrymen.</p>
<p>1st Cit . Peace there! hear the noble Antony.</p>
<p>2d Cit . We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him.</p>
<p>Ant . Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up</p>
<p>To such a sudden flood of mutiny.</p>
<p>They that have done this deed are honorable:</p>
<p>What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,</p>
<p>That made them do it; they are wise and honorable,</p>
<p>And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.</p>
<p>I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:</p>
<p>I am no orator, as Brutus is;</p>
<p>But, as you know me all, a plain, blunt man,</p>
<p>That love my friend; and that they know full well</p>
<p>That gave me public leave to speak of him:</p>
<p>For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,</p>
<p>Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,</p>
<p>To stir men’s blood: I only speak right on:</p>
<p>I tell you that which you yourselves do know;</p>
<p>Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor, poor, dumb mouths,</p>
<p>And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,</p>
<p>And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony</p>
<p>Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue</p>
<p>In every wound of Caesar, that should move</p>
<p>The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</p>
<p>Shakespeare.—Julius Caesar, Act iii, Scene ii.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-524">中文阅读</h4>
<p>安东尼 朋友们，罗马市民，我的同胞们，请听我说：</p>
<p>我是来埋葬凯撒，而不是来歌功颂德。</p>
<p>生前作恶多端，死后遗臭万年；</p>
<p>生前多行善举，骸骨地下安眠；</p>
<p>凯撒同样不会例外。高贵的布鲁特斯</p>
<p>已经告诉你们，凯撒野心勃勃：</p>
<p>若真是如此，那凯撒的确大错特错，</p>
<p>他也因此付出了惨重的代价。</p>
<p>这里，在布鲁特斯和其余诸位的允许下——</p>
<p>因为布鲁特斯无比尊贵；</p>
<p>故而其余诸位自然也无比尊贵——</p>
<p>我来到凯撒的葬礼致辞。</p>
<p>他是我的朋友，对我忠心耿耿，公正无私：</p>
<p>可是布鲁特斯却说他狼子野心;</p>
<p>而布鲁特斯本人是一位正人君子。</p>
<p>凯撒把许多俘虏带回了罗马，</p>
<p>用他们的赎金充实了国库：</p>
<p>难道这就是凯撒的狼子野心？</p>
<p>当看到哀鸿遍野，凯撒也跟着泪流满面：</p>
<p>野心本该由一副铁石心肠打制而成：</p>
<p>可是布鲁特斯却说他狼子野心；</p>
<p>而布鲁特斯本人是一位正人君子。</p>
<p>你们都是亲眼所见，在卢帕克节上，</p>
<p>我曾三次要为他戴上冠冕，</p>
<p>却遭他三次拒绝。这难道叫野心吗？</p>
<p>可是布鲁特斯却说他野心勃勃；</p>
<p>是的，毫无疑问，布鲁特斯本人是一位正人君子。</p>
<p>我不是想否定布鲁特斯所说的话，</p>
<p>我只是想和盘道出我所知的一切。</p>
<p>你们都曾经爱戴过他，这份热爱定有缘由；</p>
<p>现在又有什么道理阻止你们为他悲伤呢？</p>
<p>啊，判断力！你已经奔到了野蛮的兽群中，</p>
<p>人们都已失去了自己的理性。请宽恕我，</p>
<p>我的心现下与棺木中的凯撒同在，</p>
<p>我必须稍停片刻，等待它的归来。</p>
<p>但就在昨日，凯撒的一句话</p>
<p>可以抗衡整个世界；现在他躺在那里，</p>
<p>再卑贱的人也不肯向他表达敬意。</p>
<p>噢，在场诸位！如果我有意搅乱你们心绪</p>
<p>从而点燃愤怒，引爆叛乱，</p>
<p>那我将愧对布鲁特斯，愧对卡西乌斯，</p>
<p>众所周知，他们都是正人君子。</p>
<p>我不愿对不起他们，</p>
<p>我宁可有负于死者，有负于你们和我自己，</p>
<p>也不愿有负于这样的正人君子。</p>
<p>不过这儿有张羊皮纸，上面盖着凯撒的印章；</p>
<p>我在他的房间里发现的，是凯撒的遗嘱：</p>
<p>若是民众听到了遗嘱的内容——</p>
<p>原谅我，现在还不打算将遗嘱宣读——</p>
<p>他们会去亲吻凯撒的伤口，</p>
<p>将他们的手帕浸满他神圣的鲜血；</p>
<p>甚至会乞讨一根发丝作为留念，</p>
<p>当他们弥留之际，会在遗嘱中将它提起，</p>
<p>指明这是一笔宝贵的财富</p>
<p>要代代相传，留给子孙后裔。</p>
<p>公 民 我们要听听遗嘱上都说了些什么：读吧，马克·安东尼。</p>
<p>民 众 遗嘱，遗嘱；我们要听凯撒的遗嘱。</p>
<p>安东尼 切莫心急，朋友们，我实在不能读给你们听；</p>
<p>我不能让你们知晓凯撒是多么爱你们。</p>
<p>你们绝非草木，你们也非砖石，你们是人；</p>
<p>只要你们的心是肉长的，一旦听到凯撒的遗言，</p>
<p>必定会让你们燃烧，让你们疯狂；</p>
<p>你们最好别知道你们就是他的继承人；</p>
<p>若是你们知道了，天晓得会有什么样的后果！</p>
<p>公 民 宣读遗嘱；我们一定要听，安东尼；</p>
<p>你必须把遗嘱，凯撒的遗嘱读给我们听。</p>
<p>安东尼 你们可否别操之过急，你们可否再静候片刻？</p>
<p>我一时失言，向你们透露了这件事情：</p>
<p>我怕我会对不起那些正人君子</p>
<p>正是他们手中的短剑刺死了凯撒。我担待不起。</p>
<p>公 民 他们是叛徒：什么正人君子！</p>
<p>民 众 遗嘱！遗嘱！</p>
<p>安东尼 你们这是在逼我读遗嘱吗？</p>
<p>那就请环绕凯撒的遗体走一圈，</p>
<p>先瞻仰一下立遗嘱的人的遗容吧。</p>
<p>（他走下讲坛）</p>
<p>安东尼 若是你们有眼泪，那就准备尽情流吧。</p>
<p>你们都认识这袭袍子吧：我记得</p>
<p>凯撒第一次穿上它，</p>
<p>是一个夏天的晚上，在他的帐篷里，</p>
<p>那一天他战胜了内尔维；</p>
<p>看！就在这里，卡西乌斯短剑深深地刺了进去：</p>
<p>瞧瞧狠毒的卡斯卡割开了多大的口子：</p>
<p>就从这里，诸位拥戴热爱的布鲁特斯痛下杀手：</p>
<p>当他拔出那把罪恶的刀子时，</p>
<p>你们看看凯撒的鲜血是如何奔涌而出的，</p>
<p>就像是急不可耐地想奔到体外，</p>
<p>亲眼看看下此毒手的究竟是不是布鲁特斯；</p>
<p>因为诸位都明了，布鲁特斯是凯撒的守护天使啊。</p>
<p>神啊！请你们来证明凯撒是多么爱他！</p>
<p>这是令凯撒最为痛心疾首的一击；</p>
<p>因为当高贵的凯撒看到布鲁特斯的匕首时，</p>
<p>忘恩负义的行径远比叛徒的利刃更为锋利，</p>
<p>他被击垮了，那颗伟大的心就此破碎；</p>
<p>那袭袍子蒙着他的脸，</p>
<p>伟大的凯撒倒了下去</p>
<p>他倒在了庞贝将军雕像的底座边，</p>
<p>殷红的鲜血流了一地。</p>
<p>啊，这是多么让人痛心的陨落啊，我的同胞们！</p>
<p>当这残酷的叛变堂而皇之地骑在我们头上撒野，</p>
<p>你，我，我们所有人将一同遭受毁灭。</p>
<p>啊，你们落泪了；我看得出来，</p>
<p>你们的慈悲扣动了心弦：这是悲悯的泪水。</p>
<p>善良的人们，怎么，仅仅看到衣袍上的口子</p>
<p>你们就忍不住落泪了？那再看看这儿，</p>
<p>这才是他本人，看看他被叛徒们残害成了什么样子。</p>
<p>公民甲 啊，多么悲惨的景象！</p>
<p>公民乙 啊，高贵的凯撒！</p>
<p>公民丙 我们定要以牙还牙！</p>
<p>民 众
报仇雪恨！立马动手！逮住他们！放火！烧！杀死他们！砍死他们！一个不留！</p>
<p>安东尼 等一下，我的同胞们。</p>
<p>公民甲 静一静！听高贵的安东尼要说什么。</p>
<p>公民乙 我们听他的，我们要追随他，我们会为他万死不辞。</p>
<p>安东尼 我的好朋友们，亲爱的朋友们，别受我的挑唆</p>
<p>从而引发一场突如其来的暴乱怒潮。</p>
<p>能干出这种事的，除了正人君子还会有谁：</p>
<p>他们究竟有什么私人恩怨，啊呀，我不得而知，</p>
<p>竟使他们有这番所作所为；他们贤达睿智，品行高贵，</p>
<p>定会告诉你们理由有多充沛。</p>
<p>朋友们，我此番前来，不为博取你们的同情怜悯：</p>
<p>我不是雄辩家，不像布鲁特斯那样巧舌如簧；</p>
<p>正如你们所知，我只是一个有啥说啥的粗人，</p>
<p>我爱我的朋友；准许我在这儿说上几句的那些大人，</p>
<p>他们也完全了解我是怎样的人：</p>
<p>我没有机智，不善言辞，毫无本事，</p>
<p>不会摆姿势，不懂抑扬顿挫，也不懂利用演说技巧</p>
<p>来蛊惑人心，煽动情绪：我不过是有话直说；</p>
<p>我此番告诉你们的其实你们都已心知肚明；</p>
<p>给你们看亲爱的凯撒身上的伤口，那些都是可怜的无声的嘴巴，</p>
<p>我要它们来替我说话：但如果我是布鲁特斯，</p>
<p>而布鲁特斯是安东尼的话，那么就会有一个安东尼</p>
<p>把你们挑动得群情激奋，在凯撒的每道伤口上</p>
<p>按上舌头，能把罗马的石头都挑唆得来参加暴动。</p>

<p>THE ENGLISH CHARACTER</p>
<p>英国人的品格</p>
<p>William Hickling Prescott, 1796-1859, the historian, was the son of
William Prescott, an eminent jurist, and the grandson of Col. William
Prescott, who commanded the Americans at the battle of Bunker Hill. He
was born in Salem, Massachusetts, graduated at Harvard University in
1814, and died in Boston. Just as he was completing his college course,
the careless sport of a fellow-student injured one of his eyes so
seriously that he never recovered from it. He had intended to adopt law
as his profession; but, from his detective eyesight, he was obliged to
choose work in which he could regulate his hours of labor, and could
employ the aid of a secretary. He chose to be a historian; and followed
his choice with wonderful system, perseverance, and success till the
close of his life. His works are: “The Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,”
“The Conquest of Mexico,” “The Conquest of Peru,” “The Reign of Philip
II,” and a volume of “Miscellanies.” He had not completed the history of
Philip at the time of his death. As a writer of history, Mr. Prescott
ranks with the first for accuracy, precision, clearness, and beauty of
style. As a man, he was genial, kind-hearted and even-tempered.</p>
<p>On the whole, what I have seen raises my preconceived estimate of the
English character. It is full of generous, true, and manly qualities;
and I doubt if there ever was so high a standard of morality in an
aristocracy which has such means for self-indulgence at its command, and
which occupies a position that secures it so much deference. In general,
they do not seem to abuse their great advantages. The respect for
religion—at least for the forms of it—is universal, and there are few, I
imagine, of the great proprietors who are not more or less occupied with
improving their estates, and with providing for the comfort of their
tenantry, while many take a leading part in the great political
movements of the time. There never was an aristocracy which combined so
much practical knowledge and industry with the advantages of exalted
rank.</p>
<p>The Englishman is seen to most advantage in his country home. For he
is constitutionally both domestic and rural in his habits. His fireside
and his farm—these are the places in which one sees his simple and warm-
hearted nature more freely unfolded. There is a shyness in an
Englishman, —a natural reserve, which makes him cold to strangers, and
difficult to approach. But once corner him in his own house, a frank and
full expansion will be given to his feelings that we should look for in
vain in the colder Yankee, and a depth not to be found in the light and
superficial Frenchman,—speaking of nationalities, not of
individualities.</p>
<p>The Englishman is the most truly rural in his tastes and habits of
any people in the world. I am speaking of the higher classes. The
aristocracy of other countries affect the camp and the city. But the
English love their old castles and country seats with a patriotic love.
They are fond of country sports. Every man shoots or hunts. No man is
too old to be in the saddle some part of the day, and men of seventy
years and more follow the hounds, and, take a five-barred gate at a
leap. The women are good whips, are fond of horses and dogs, and other
animals. Duchesses have their cows, their poultry, their pigs,—all
watched over and provided with accommodations of Dutch-like neatness.
All this is characteristic of the people. It may be thought to detract
something from the feminine graces which in other lands make a woman so
amiably dependent as to be nearly imbecile. But it produces a healthy
and blooming race of women to match the hardy Englishman,—the finest
development of the physical and moral nature which the world has
witnessed. For we are not to look on the English gentleman as a mere
Nimrod. With all his relish for field sports and country usages, he has
his house filled with collections of art and with extensive libraries.
The tables of the drawing-rooms are covered with the latest works, sent
down by the London publisher. Every guest is provided with an apparatus
for writing, and often a little library of books for his own amusement.
The English country gentleman of the present day is anything but a
Squire Western, though he does retain all his relish for field
sports.</p>
<p>The character of an Englishman, under its most refined aspect, has
some disagreeable points which jar unpleasantly on the foreigner not
accustomed to them. The consciousness of national superiority, combined
with natural feelings of independence, gives him an air of arrogance,
though it must be owned that this is never betrayed in his own house,—I
may almost say in his own country. But abroad, when he seems to
institute a comparison between himself and the people he is thrown with,
it becomes so obvious that he is the most unpopular, not to say odious,
person in the world. Even the open hand with which he dispenses his
bounty will not atone for the violence he offers to national vanity.</p>
<p>There are other defects, which are visible even in his most favored
circumstances. Such is his bigotry, surpassing everything in a quiet
passive form, that has been witnessed since the more active bigotry of
the times of the Spanish Philips. Such, too, is the exclusive, limited
range of his knowledge and conceptions of all political and social
topics and relations. The Englishman, the cultivated Englishman, has no
standard of excellence borrowed from mankind. His speculation never
travels beyond his own little—great little—island. That is the world to
him. True, he travels, shoots lions among the Hottentots, chases the
grizzly bear over the Rocky Mountains, kills elephants in India and
salmon on the coast of Labrador, comes home, and very likely makes a
book. But the scope of his ideas does not seem to be enlarged by all
this. The body travels, not the mind. And, however he may abuse his own
land, he returns home as hearty a John Bull, with all his prejudices and
national tastes as rooted, as before. The English—the men of fortune—all
travel. Yet how little sympathy they show for other people or
institutions, and how slight is the interest they take in them! They are
islanders, cut off from the great world. But their island is, indeed, a
world of its own. With all their faults, never has the sun shone—if one
may use the expression in reference to England—all a more noble race, or
one that has done more for the great interests of humanity.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-525">中文阅读</h4>
<p>总体而言，历年来的所见所闻让我对英国人的性格有了一番先入为主的认识。它充满了慷慨、忠诚和勇敢的品质；这让我怀疑，在一众身居群星拱月的高位、可以为所欲为的贵族身上，是否可能具备如此之高的道德标准。通常，他们都将这些与生俱来的巨大优势用在了正途上。比如对宗教的虔诚——至少在形式上——是无所不在的，而在我的印象中，几乎所有资产雄厚的皇亲国戚都在领导波澜壮阔的政治运动同时，或多或少都会兼顾到自身财产的扩张，并确保自己的佃农能安居乐业。这样的贵族堪称史无前例，他们身上兼备了渊博的实用知识、务实的勤勉作风以及至高的阶级尊荣。</p>
<p>只有在乡间的家中，英国人身上的优点才能得以淋漓尽致地展现。因为他天生就是恋家之人，同时迷恋田园生活。炉火边还有农场里——在这些地方，你才能看到他们更自由自在、更无所顾忌地挥洒单纯、热情的天性。英国人畏羞，——这种与生俱来的含蓄内敛会让他们在陌生人面前显得冷淡，难以亲近。可一旦在他家中一隅与他相遇，他的率真坦诚、毫无保留的一面会让我们对他的印象大为改观，而这种情感的迸发在人情淡漠的美国佬身上难得一见，而这种深沉的情感，在轻佻肤浅的法国人身上几乎无迹可寻——这里指的是笼统的国民性，而非单一个体的具体个性。</p>
<p>英国人无比崇尚野外生活，在那里他们如鱼得水，这一点即便放眼全世界，也是无人能及的。这里我指的是上流阶层的人士。其他国家的贵族喜爱露营或城市。但英国人则对寄托着爱国情怀的古老城堡和乡间别墅情有独钟。他们热爱野外运动，每个男人都扛枪狩猎。没有人会因为上了岁数而在骑马时佩上马鞍，年过七旬或更为年迈的老人一样跟在猎犬后面追捕猎物，一样能策马纵身越过五道栅栏的起跑门。妇女们则擅长驯养，她们喜欢马和狗，还有其他各种动物。公爵夫人们在府邸豢养奶牛、家禽和猪——动物们受到的照顾无微不至，就连它们的饮食起居都体现着德国式的井井有条。这些都是民族特性。或许人们会觉得她们身上的女性优雅会因此大打折扣，不像其他国家的女士小鸟依人到近乎孱弱无能的地步。然而正是这些特质塑造了英国女性的健康体质和蓬勃生气，使之与英国男性的坚忍不拔与刻苦耐劳相得益彰——这是举世共睹的身体素质与道德品质的完美统一。我们不能把英国乡绅仅仅视为猎手。他除了喜爱野外运动，热衷乡村习俗外，他的屋子里还搜罗了大量的艺术品，又设有包罗万象的藏书室。画室的桌上堆满了伦敦出版社送来的最新作品。他给每一位访客准备了笔墨，还提供了一个精巧的图书室以供消遣。如今，斯夸尔·魏斯特恩已不能再作为英国乡绅的代名词了，当然，他热爱狩猎的一面还是被原封不动地保留了下来。</p>
<p>在其极富教养的外表下，英国人的性格中也有着让外国人心生不快、难以接受的一面。强烈的民族优越感，加上天生的特立独行，不免让他看上去傲慢自大——虽然必须承认在他自己家里他绝不会流露出一星半点——我几乎敢说在他自己的国家他也不会。但要是在国外，当他开始将自己和他身边的人进行比较时，就算谈不上让人厌恶，无疑也是世上最不受欢迎的那一个。即使他慷慨无私，出手大方，也无法弥补他炫耀民族优越感时带来的伤害。</p>
<p>他身上还有其他缺点，这些缺点即便在他最受人欢迎的时候依然清晰可见。比如他的顽固，在腓力统治西班牙时期，英国人的顽固可谓张牙舞爪，此后，这份顽固虽说收起了锋芒，但仍旧是英国人所有缺点中最为显著的一个。又比如，对于政治和社会话题以及人际关系，他的知识面单一狭隘、颇受局限，所持的见解专断、偏执。英国人，这些极富教养的英国人，他们没有任何一套优秀的准则是借鉴自其他国家。他的思维从来没有超越那个小小的、小得不能再小的岛屿。对他而言，这就是整个世界。诚然，他四处游历，跑到霍顿督人那里射杀狮群，翻越落基山脉追捕灰熊，来到印度猎象，去拉布拉多沿岸捕获鲑鱼，然后返回家乡，把游历的所见所闻写成游记。然而他的思想境界却依然固步自封。肉身在各地游历，精神却没有一同前往。无论他对自己国家如何出言不逊，但回到国内，他依然是那个妄自尊大的约翰牛，所有的偏见依旧根深蒂固，民族特性仍然一成不变。英国人——有钱的英国人——走遍世界。然而他们对其他民族或制度习俗怀有的同情和表露的兴趣，却是那样的微乎其微！他们蜗居岛上，与世隔绝。不过他们的岛屿就是自成一格的世界。他们身上虽然有众多缺点，然而在太阳所能照见的疆域中——如果有人这样形容英国的话——他们也许可以堪称是最为高贵、对人类做出至伟贡献的民族了。</p>

<p>A HOT DAY IN NEW YORK</p>
<p>纽约酷热的一天</p>
<p>William Dean Howells, 1837—, was born in Belmont County. Ohio. In
boyhood he learned the printer’s trade, at which he worked for several
years. He published a volume of poems in 1860, in connection with John
J. Piatt. From 1861 to 1865 he was United States Consul at Venice. On
his return he resided for a time in New York City, and was one of the
editors of the “Nation.” In 1871 he was appointed editor in chief of the
“Atlantic Monthly.” He held the position ten years, and then retired in
order to devote himself to his own writings. Since then, he has been
connected with other literary magazines.</p>
<p>Mr. Howells has written several books: novels and sketches: his
writings are marked by an artistic finish, and a keen but subtile humor.
The following selection is an extract from “Their Wedding Journey.”</p>
<p>When they alighted, they took their way up through one of the streets
of the great wholesale businesses, to Broadway. On this street was a
throng of trucks and wagons, lading and unlading; bales and boxes rose
and sank by pulleys overhead; the footway was a labyrinth of packages of
every shape and size; there was no flagging of the pitiless energy that
moved all forward, no sign of how heavy a weight lay on it, save in the
reeking faces of its helpless instruments.</p>
<p>It was four o’clock, the deadliest hour of the deadly summer day. The
spiritless air seemed to have a quality of blackness in it, as if filled
with the gloom of low-hovering wings. One half the street lay in shadow,
and one half in sun; but the sunshine itself was dim, as if a heat
greater than its own had smitten it with languor. Little gusts of sick,
warm wind blew across the great avenue at the corners of the
intersecting streets. In the upward distance, at which the journeyers
looked, the loftier roofs and steeples lifted themselves dim out of the
livid atmosphere, and far up and down the length of the street swept a
stream of tormented life.</p>
<p>All sorts of wheeled things thronged it, conspicuous among which
rolled and jarred the gaudily painted stages, with quivering horses
driven each by a man who sat in the shade of a branching, white
umbrella, and suffered with a moody truculence of aspect, and as if he
harbored the bitterness of death in his heart for the crowding
passengers within, when one of them pulled the strap about his legs, and
summoned him to halt.</p>
<p>Most of the foot passengers kept to the shady side, and to the
unaccustomed eyes of the strangers they were not less in number than at
any other time, though there were fewer women among them. Indomitably
resolute of soul, they held their course with the swift pace of custom,
and only here and there they showed the effect of the heat.</p>
<p>One man, collarless, with waistcoat unbuttoned, and hat set far back
from his forehead, waved a fan before his death-white, flabby face, and
set down one foot after the other with the heaviness of a somnambulist.
Another, as they passed him, was saying huskily to the friend at his
side, “I can’t stand this much longer. My hands tingle as if they had
gone to sleep; my heart—” But still the multitude hurried on, passing,
repassing, encountering, evading, vanishing into shop doors, and
emerging from them, dispersing down the side streets, and swarming out
of them.</p>
<p>It was a scene that possessed the beholder with singular fascination,
and in its effect of universal lunacy, it might well have seemed the
last phase of a world presently to be destroyed. They who were in it,
but not of it, as they fancied—though there was no reason for
this—looked on it amazed, and at last their own errands being
accomplished, and themselves so far cured of the madness of purpose,
they cried with one voice that it was a hideous sight, and strove to
take refuge from it in the nearest place where the soda fountain
sparkled.</p>
<p>It was a vain desire. At the front door of the apothecary’s hung a
thermometer, and as they entered they heard the next comer cry out with
a maniacal pride in the affliction laid upon mankind, “Ninety-seven
degrees!” Behind them, at the door, there poured in a ceaseless stream
of people, each pausing at the shrine of heat, before he tossed off the
hissing draught that two pale, close-clipped boys served them from
either side of the fountain. Then, in the order of their coming, they
issued through another door upon the side street, each, as he
disappeared, turning his face half round, and casting a casual glance
upon a little group near another counter.</p>
<p>The group was of a very patient, half-frightened, half-puzzled
looking gentleman who sat perfectly still on a stool, and of a lady who
stood beside him, rubbing all over his head a handkerchief full of
pounded ice, and easing one hand with the other when the first became
tired. Basil drank his soda, and paused to look upon this group, which
he felt would commend itself to realistic sculpture as eminently
characteristic of the local life, and, as “The Sunstroke,” would sell
enormously in the hot season.</p>
<p>“Better take a little more of that,” the apothecary said, looking up
from his prescription, and, as the organized sympathy of the seemingly
indifferent crowd, smiling very kindly at his patient, who thereupon
tasted something in the glass he held.</p>
<p>“Do you still feel like fainting?” asked the humane authority.
“Slightly, now and then,” answered the other, “but I’m hanging on hard
to the bottom curve of that icicled S on your soda fountain, and I feel
that I’m all right as long as I can see that. The people get rather hazy
occasionally, and have no features to speak of. But I don’t know that I
look very impressive myself,” he added in the jesting mood which seems
the natural condition of Americans in the face of an embarrassments.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’ll do!” the apothecary answered, with a laugh; but he said,
in an answer to an anxious question from the lady, “He mustn’t be moved
for an hour yet,” and gayly pestled away at a prescription, while she
resumed her office of grinding the pounded ice round and round upon her
husband’s skull. Isabel offered her the commiseration of friendly words,
and of looks kinder yet, and then, seeing that they could do nothing,
she and Basil fell into the endless procession, and passed out of the
side door.</p>
<p>“What a shocking thing,” she whispered. “Did you see how all the
people looked, one after another, so indifferently at that couple, and
evidently forgot them the next instant? It was dreadful. I shouldn’t
like to have you sun-struck in New York.”</p>
<p>“That’s very considerate of you; but place for place, if any accident
must happen to me among strangers, I think I should prefer to have it in
New York. The biggest place is always the kindest as well as the
cruelest place. Amongst the thousands of spectators the good Samaritan
as well as the Levite would be sure to be. As for a sunstroke, it
requires peculiar gifts. But if you compel me to a choice in the matter,
then I say give me the busiest part of Broadway for a sunstroke. There
is such experience of calamity there that you could hardly fall the
first victim to any misfortune.”</p>

<p>他们下了车，随即踏上了通往百老汇的路，街道两旁林立着许多批发商行，就像诸多通往百老汇的商业街一样热闹繁忙。一路上到处都是卡车和马车，装货的、卸货的，没一刻消停；头顶上的滑车或起或降，大包的货物和箱子在眼前上上下下；人行道上简直无处落脚，形状各异、尺寸不一的包装袋在行走的空间建起了一座迷宫；周遭并未出现热火朝天的忙碌景象，也看不出来要搬运的货物有多沉重，除了那些工人们——那些无助的傀儡散发的汗臭露出了些许蛛丝马迹。</p>
<p>现在是下午四点，正是酷热难当的夏日里最让人打不起精神的时候。沉闷的空气里弥漫着无望与沮丧的味道，就像有一双低空盘旋着的巨大羽翼，一切都像是笼罩在其阴郁昏暗中。街道的半边躲在阴影里，另一边暴露在日头底下；只是那阳光显得无精打采，仿佛比它更为强大的燠热正卷裹着重重倦怠，削弱了它应有的锋芒。几许微弱、闷热的风懒洋洋地吹过位于十字路口的大道。举目远眺，旅人可以看到屋顶与尖塔影影绰绰的轮廓，他们凭借着高挑的身姿终于在一片死气沉沉的青灰色中突围而出，而远处正沿着大道来来往往的则是推推搡搡的苦恼人生。</p>
<p>所有带着轮子的交通工具都蜂拥而至，滚动的车轮，摇晃的车身，在这浮华俗艳的舞台格外显眼，车夫坐在一顶白色遮阳伞下驾驭着上下晃动的马匹，每当有人拽了拽他腿上的皮带，让他靠边停车时，他脸上就会挂上气凶凶的凶狠表情，仿佛身后满车厢乘客的不满和怨恨全部装进了他一个人心里。</p>
<p>大多数行人贴着阴凉一侧行走，在外乡人眼里，路上的行人不会比其他时候少，尽管女性的比例确实少些。他们一个个面不改色，和往常一样步履匆匆，坚定不移地朝着既定方向走去，而酷热之于他们的影响只是偶尔才露一下峥嵘。</p>
<p>一个穿着无领衬衫的男人，敞着马甲的前襟，头上的帽子几乎扣在了后脑勺上，他拿着扇子，对着自己惨白的脸一个劲儿地猛扇，每一步都踩得像在梦游一般沉重呆滞。当他们经过另一个人时，听到他哑着一把嗓子对边上的朋友说：“我可再也受不了了。我的手像是麻掉一样一阵阵刺痛；我的心——”然而，仍有那么多人行色匆匆，此处他们萍水相逢，彼处复又擦肩而过，他们或是迎面而上，或是远远避开，一会儿闪进店门，一会儿从那儿钻出来，这一刻转入小巷四处流散，下一刻又从不同的巷口蜂拥而出。</p>
<p>面对眼前的一幕，旁观者无比迷惑，这种奇景乱象比比皆是，让人萌生错觉，仿佛末世转瞬即至。那些置身于其中的人，却恍然以为他们身在别处——尽管对于这种感觉他们也无从解释——无比惊叹地看着这一切，等到他们办完了手头的差事，疯狂的意念就此断根，他们都会异口同声地喊道此番景象实在恐怖，然后忙不迭地奋力奔向最近一处有冷饮柜台的地方避热消暑。</p>
<p>只是这一愿望也注定落空。药房的前门处挂着一支温度计，当他们进门的时候听到后面有人大喊一声，“九十七度！”声音里含着一股洋洋得意，仿佛这让人间受了大罪的酷暑逼疯了那声音的主人。在他们身后，人们源源不断地涌了进来，每一个都会在这一小块避暑胜地——冷饮柜台前驻足停留，由两个分立左右，面色苍白，尚未长出胡须的男孩招呼着，接过冰镇饮料一饮而尽。而后，他们按照进门的顺序，一个接一个从设在巷口的边门走出去，就在他们马上要走出视野的时候，每个人都会微微转过脸，向另一个柜台附近的两人投去漫不经心的一瞥。</p>
<p>其中的一个正是患病的绅士，他看上去半是惊惶，半是困惑，分外安静地端坐在长凳上，另一位女士站在他身边，正用包着碎冰块的手帕来回擦拭他的脑袋，若一只手举酸了，另一只手接过手帕继续擦。巴兹尔喝了口汽水，凝神打量着他们，心想这道当地民生特有的风景线应该被刻成雕塑，取名为“中暑”，在这酷热难当的暑天一定大卖。</p>
<p>“最好再多喝些这个。”药剂师从处方笺上抬起头，然后像是代表周围无动于衷的人群致以同情一样，朝着病人格外友善地微笑着，病人随即端起了手中的杯子，尝了尝杯中的药水。</p>
<p>“现在还头晕吗？”这位仁心仁术的权威问。“稍微有点，偶尔还是觉得晕，”病人答道，“不过我拼命盯着冷饮柜台上那个S形冰柱的弧形底部看，只要我能看见那个，就不觉得那么难受了。看人的时候偶尔会觉得对方面目模糊，具体五官长成啥样就更无从说起了。话说回来，在别人眼里，我也好不到哪儿去。”美国人遭遇尴尬时一般都会说上两句俏皮话，他也自然而然地来了句自嘲。</p>
<p>“才不是呢，你让人过目不忘！”药剂师大笑着说；不过当那位女士忧心忡忡地询问病情时，他的回答变成了“一个小时内别挪动他”，说完便按着配方欢天喜地开始杵捣，女士则重新用碎冰块来回擦拭她丈夫的脑袋。伊莎贝尔友善地搭讪了两句聊表关心，脸上的神情越发和气，不过见自己也帮不上什么忙，于是汇入人流，从边门离开了药房。</p>
<p>“太可怕了，”她讷讷地说。“你有没有注意到人们脸上的表情，一个接一个，眼瞅着那对夫妻，全是一副事不关己的模样，难道他们就一点也不担心下一个倒下的就是自己？太没有人情味了。我可不会让你在纽约中暑的。”</p>
<p>“你想的可真周到；不过设身处地想一下，如果注定要让我置身于一群陌生人中遭遇什么不测的话，那我宁可发生在纽约。大城市里有最善良的一面，同时也会有最无情的一面。在成千上万的旁观者中总会有乐善好施的撒玛利亚人，当然也少不了铁石心肠的利未人。至于中暑嘛，那也不是随随便便什么人都有机会中暑的。不过如果你硬是要让我在这件事上作选择的话，那我希望在百老汇最繁华热闹的地段倒下。就灾祸这件事而言，有这么一条经验之谈，不幸不会第一个降临到你头上。”</p>

<p>DISCONTENT.—AN ALLEGORY</p>
<p>人心不足——一则寓言</p>
<p>Joseph Addison, 1672-1719, the brilliant essayist and poet, has long
occupied an exalted place in English literature. He was the son of an
English clergyman, was born in Wiltshire, and educated at Oxford; he
died at “Holland House” (the property of his wife, to whom he had been
married but about two years), and was buried in Westminster Abbey.
Several years of his life were spent in the political affairs of his
time, he held several public offices, and was, for ten years, a member
of Parliament. His fame as an author rests chiefly upon his “Hymns,” his
tragedy of “Cato,” and his “Essays” contributed principally to the
“Tatler” and the “Spectator.” The excellent style of his essays, their
genial wit and sprightly humor, made them conspicuous in an age when
coarseness, bitterness, and exaggeration deformed the writings of the
most eminent: and these characteristics have given them an unquestioned
place among the classics of our language.</p>
<p>Mr. Addison was shy and diffident, but genial and lovable; his moral
character was above reproach, excepting that he is said to have been too
fond of wine.</p>
<p>It is a celebrated thought of Socrates, that if all the misfortunes
of mankind were cast into a public stock, in order to be equally
distributed among the whole species, those who now think themselves the
most unhappy, would prefer the share they are already possessed of
before that which would fall to them by such a division. Horace has
carried this thought a great deal farther, and supposes that the
hardships or misfortunes we lie under, are more easy to us than those of
any other person would be, in case we could change conditions with
him.</p>
<p>As I was ruminating on these two remarks, and seated in my
elbowchair, I insensibly fell asleep; when, on a sudden, methought there
was a proclamation made by Jupiter, that every mortal should bring in
his griefs and calamities, and throw them together in a heap. There was
a large plain appointed for this purpose. I took my stand in the center
of it, and saw, with a great deal of pleasure, the whole human species
marching one after another, and throwing down their several loads, which
immediately grew up into a prodigious mountain, that seemed to rise
above the clouds.</p>
<p>There was a certain lady of a thin, airy shape, who was very active
in this solemnity. She carried a magnifying glass in one of her hands,
and was clothed in a loose, flowing robe, embroidered with several
figures of fiends and specters, that discovered themselves in a thousand
chimerical shapes as her garment hovered in the wind. There was
something wild and distracted in her looks. Her name was Fancy. She led
up every mortal to the appointed place, after having officiously
assisted him in making up his pack, and laying it upon his shoulders. My
heart melted within me to see my fellow-creatures groaning under their
respective burdens, and to consider that prodigious bulk of human
calamities which lay before me.</p>
<p>There were, however, several persons who gave me great diversion upon
this occasion. I observed one bringing in a fardel, very carefully
concealed under an old embroidered cloak, which, upon his throwing it
into the heap, I discovered to be poverty. Another, after a great deal
of puffing, threw down his luggage, which, upon examining, I found to be
his wife.</p>
<p>There were multitudes of lovers saddled with very whimsical burdens,
composed of darts and flames; but, what was very odd, though they sighed
as if their hearts would break under these bundles of calamities, they
could not persuade themselves to cast them into the heap, when they came
up to it; but, after a few faint efforts, shook their heads, and marched
away as heavy loaden as they came.</p>
<p>I saw multitudes of old women throw down their wrinkles, and several
young ones who stripped themselves of a tawny skin. There were very
great heaps of red noses, large lips, and rusty teeth. The truth of it
is, I was surprised to see the greatest part of the mountain made up of
bodily deformities. Observing one advancing toward the heap with a
larger cargo than ordinary upon his back, I found, upon his near
approach, that it was only a natural hump, which he disposed of with
great joy of heart among this collection of human miseries.</p>
<p>There were, likewise, distempers of all sorts, though I could not but
observe that there were many more imaginary than real. One little packet
I could not but take notice of, which was a complication of all the
diseases incident to human nature, and was in the hand of a great many
fine people. This was called the spleen. But what most of all surprised
me was, that there was not a single vice or folly thrown into the whole
heap: at which I was very much astonished, having concluded within
myself that everyone would take this opportunity of getting rid of his
passions, prejudices, and frailties.</p>
<p>I took notice in particular of a very profligate fellow, who, I did
not question, came loaden with his crimes, but upon searching into his
bundle, I found that instead of throwing his guilt from him, he had only
laid down his memory. He was followed by another worthless rogue, who
flung away his modesty instead of his ignorance.</p>
<p>When the whole race of mankind had thus cast their burdens, the
phantom which had been so busy on this occasion, seeing me an idle
spectator of what passed, approached toward me. I grew uneasy at her
presence, when, of a sudden, she held her magnifying glass full before
my eyes. I no sooner saw my face in it, but was startled at the
shortness of it, which now appeared to me in its utmost aggravation. The
immoderate breadth of the features made me very much out of humor with
my own countenance, upon which I threw it from me like a mask. It
happened very luckily that one who stood by me had just before thrown
down his visage, which, it seems, was too long for him. It was, indeed,
extended to a most shameful length; I believe the very chin was,
modestly speaking, as long as my whole face. We had both of us an
opportunity of mending ourselves; and all the contributions being now
brought in, every man was at liberty to exchange his misfortunes for
those of another person.</p>
<p>As we stood round the heap, and surveyed the several materials of
which it was composed, there was scarcely a mortal in this vast
multitude who did not discover what he thought pleasures and blessings
of life, and wondered how the owners of them ever came to look upon them
as burthens and grievances. As we were regarding very attentively this
confusion of miseries, this chaos of calamity, Jupiter issued out a
second proclamation, that everyone was now at liberty to exchange his
affliction, and to return to his habitation with any such other bundle
as should be delivered to him. Upon this, Fancy began again to bestir
herself, and, parceling out the whole heap with incredible activity,
recommended to everyone his particular packet. The hurry and confusion
at this time was not to be expressed. Some observations, which I made
upon the occasion, I shall communicate to the public.</p>
<p>A venerable, gray-headed man, who had laid down the colic, and who, I
found, wanted an heir to his estate, snatched up an undutiful son that
had been thrown into the heap by an angry father. The graceless youth,
in less than a quarter of an hour, pulled the old gentleman by the
beard, and had liked to have knocked his brains out; so that meeting the
true father, who came toward him with a fit of the gripes, he begged him
to take his son again, and give him back his colic; but they were
incapable, either of them, to recede from the choice they had made. A
poor galley slave, who had thrown down his chains, took up the gout in
their stead, but made such wry faces that one might easily perceive he
was no great gainer by the bargain.</p>
<p>The female world were very busy among themselves in bartering for
features; one was trucking a lock of gray hairs for a carbuncle; and
another was making over a short waist for a pair of round shoulders; but
on all these occasions there was not one of them who did not think the
new blemish, as soon as she had got it into her possession, much more
disagreeable than the old one.</p>
<p>I must not omit my own particular adventure. My friend with the long
visage had no sooner taken upon him my short face, but he made such a
grotesque figure in it, that as I looked upon him, I could not forbear
laughing at myself, insomuch that I put my own face out of countenance.
The poor gentleman was so sensible of the ridicule, that I found he was
ashamed of what he had done. On the other side, I found that I myself
had no great reason to triumph, for as I went to touch my forehead, I
missed the place, and clapped my finger upon my upper lip. Besides, as
my nose was exceedingly prominent, I gave it two or three unlucky knocks
as I was playing my hand about my face, and aiming at some other part of
it.</p>
<p>I saw two other gentlemen by me who were in the same ridiculous
circumstances. These had made a foolish swap between a couple of thick
bandy legs and two long trapsticks that had no calves to them. One of
these looked like a man walking upon stilts, and was so lifted up into
the air, above his ordinary height, that his head turned round with it,
while the other made such awkward circles, as he attempted to walk, that
he scarcely knew how to move forward upon his new supporters. Observing
him to be a pleasant kind of a fellow, I stuck my cane in the ground,
and told him I would lay him a bottle of wine that he did not march up
to it on a line that I drew for him, in a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>The heap was at last distributed among the two sexes, who made a most
piteous sight, as they wandered up and down under the pressure of their
several burthens. The whole plain was filled with murmurs and
complaints, groans and lamentations. Jupiter, at length taking
compassion on the poor mortals, ordered them a second time to lay down
their loads, with a design to give everyone his own again. They
discharged themselves with a great deal of pleasure; after which, the
phantom who had led them into such gross delusions, was commanded to
disappear. There was sent in her stead a goddess of a quite different
figure: her motions were steady and composed, and her aspect serious but
cheerful. She every now and then cast her eyes toward heaven, and fixed
them upon Jupiter. Her name was Patience. She had no sooner placed
herself by the Mount of Sorrows, but, what I thought very remarkable,
the whole heap sunk to such a degree that it did not appear a third part
so big as it was before. She afterward returned every man his own proper
calamity, and, teaching him how to bear it in the most commodious
manner, he marched off with it contentedly, being very well pleased that
he had not been left to his own choice as to the kind of evil which fell
to his lot.</p>
<p>Beside the several pieces of morality to be drawn out of this vision,
I learnt from it never to repine at my own misfortunes, or to envy the
happiness of another, since it is impossible for any man to form a right
judgment of his neighbor’s sufferings; for which reason, also, I have
determined never to think too lightly of another’s complaints, but to
regard the sorrows of my fellow-creatures with sentiments of humanity
and compassion.</p>

<p>苏格拉底有句名言：若是将人间所有的苦难聚拢在一起，而后重新平摊到每个人身上，那么那些原本认为自己是至苦至难的人，必定会甘愿拿回原先属于他们的那一份。贺拉斯将这一说法进一步地发扬光大，他认为同样的苦难与不幸，若是换成其他任何人，也许就不会像我们那样应付得相对容易些。</p>
<p>我坐在扶手椅上苦苦思索着这两句话，不知不觉竟然昏昏欲睡了；突然，我的耳畔响起了朱庇特的断言，他说每个在这世上走一遭的人注定会带来困苦与灾难，这些困苦与灾难不断地聚少成多。为此有一大片平地来放置这些痛楚。我就在这片平地的中心，饶有兴味地看着人们从面前川流不息地走过，一个个卸下苦难的重负，这些重负转眼间变成了拔地而起的高山，几乎直抵云端。</p>
<p>队伍中有一位女士在整场庄严的仪式中显得格外活跃，她身材瘦削，身形若真若幻，一手执着一个巨大的杯子，身上宽松长袍如同一池湖水般泛起层层涟漪，衣袍上面绣满了魑魅魍魉，风卷衣衫，那些奇形怪状的神灵鬼怪几乎随时呼之欲出。她脸上的神情带着些许狂乱不羁。她叫错觉。她领着每个人来到指定的地点，殷勤地帮助他们一一打包，将那些包裹安放在他们的肩膀上。我看着我的同类在各自的重负之下呻吟喘息，思考着眼前不断堆积、变得无比庞大的人类苦难，我的心为之伤痛。</p>
<p>然后，有几个人的出现分散了我的注意力。我看到其中一个带着一个大包裹，一件陈旧的绣花斗篷把包裹遮盖得严严实实，就在他把包裹扔进重负山的刹那，我看出里头藏着的是贫穷。还有一个人，身上的重担把他压得直喘粗气，趁他扔下重负的时候，我细细打量，发现里头竟然是他的妻子。</p>
<p>数不胜数的恋人身上背负的东西让人觉得不可思议，里头装着穿心的利剑、炙热的烈焰；可奇怪的是，虽然这重重苦难压得他们几乎喘不过气来，可当他们走近重负山时，仍旧无法说服自己把肩上的东西丢弃；然而，经过几次徒劳的欲弃还留后，他们还是摇着头狠下心，只是离开的时候他们虽然已是两肩空空，但看上去似乎和来时路上一样不堪重负。</p>
<p>我看见无数的女人将自己的皱纹丢弃，还有几个年轻人生生地剥去了自己黄褐色的皮肤。重负山上有着数不清的酒糟鼻、香肠嘴和黄斑牙。我惊诧地发现这里最为可观的部分，竟是由人类肉身的各种缺陷堆积而成。有人驮着大的异乎寻常的行李走过来，等到他来到跟前，我发现那就是个天生的驼背，他把这个负累扔进苦难山的时候显得如释重负，轻松愉快。</p>
<p>好像还有各种各样的疾病被扔在那里，虽然我发现想象出来的疾病远远超过肉身真正罹患的。但是最让我意想不到的是整座重负山上竟然没有一项恶习或荒唐行径：我之所以无比震惊，是因为原先我理所当然地以为大家都会借此良机摒弃他们的狂热、偏见和品德上的瑕疵。</p>
<p>所有的凡人将他们的重负一一丢弃后，那位一直忙前忙后的女巫看见只有我一个人站在边上无所事事，袖手旁观，便朝我走过来。我有些局促不安，当女巫手中那硕大无比的杯子突然挡在我面前时，我立马在里面看到自己的脸，一张短得让我惊诧万分的脸，这会儿在杯子的映照下更是难看得无以复加。这副过度横向发展的长相让我闷闷不乐，于是我毫不犹豫地，像扯下面具一样把它扔进了重负山。凑巧的是站在我前面的人也刚好扔掉他那张脸，那是一张长得过分、长得几乎无地自容的脸，我看光是那下巴，据保守估计，怎么着也抵得上我整张脸的长度。这下，我们正好有机会互补长短；这下，所有的舍弃物都能变废为宝，人人可以自由交换，看看他人的不幸可否成为自己的福音。</p>
<p>我们围着重负山，翻看着别人扔掉的东西，在场的芸芸众生无不感叹为什么自己在山中淘到的命中至宝居然会被当成累赘或厌弃之物，扔之而后快。正在我们忘乎所以地沉浸在这场苦难之荒、灾祸之乱时，耳边响起了朱庇特第二道旨意，现在每个人都可以自行交换他们的不幸，而后带上派发给他们的包裹回到各自的原住地。指令一经下达，错觉女巫又重新忙活起来，她将整座重负山不可思议地拆分成一个个包裹，而后一一指定送到每个人手中。现场混乱忙碌的场景这里就不再赘述。不过我想和大家一起分享一下其中我所观察到的某些片段。</p>
<p>一位灰白头发、德高望重的长者，他因为疝气痛得倒下了，因为急于找一位房产继承人，于是抓住了一个刚被生气的父亲扔掉的不孝之子。可是还不到一刻钟，这个不知好歹的年轻人就原形毕露，他揪住老者的胡子一顿拳打脚踢，狂殴之下老人几乎当场一命呜呼；等遇到年轻人的父亲，老者拉着他叫苦不迭，苦苦央求他带回他的儿子，把疝气还给自己。然而他们两个谁也不可能反悔了。还有一个可怜的海船奴隶，他成功抛下了身上的锁链，换来痛风，不过从他龇牙咧嘴的表情不难看出这场交易他并没有占到多少便宜。</p>
<p>女人们扎成堆，忙着为她们的皮囊讨价还价；有人用一绺银发换来一个疔；有人转让了一截短腰换回了一双浑圆的肩膀；只是交易过后几乎所有人都发现换回来的新缺陷比起自己扔掉的沉疴旧疾更让她们不痛快。</p>
<p>而我也无法对发生在自己身上的奇遇视若不见。那个长脸的朋友一换上我的短面孔，立马变得无比可笑，我瞅了他一眼，忍不住对着自己哈哈大笑起来，因为那张怪脸的主人就是我。可怜的先生对别人的嘲笑尤为敏感，我看得出对于换脸这件事他后悔不迭。而另一方面，我发现自己也好不到哪儿去，因为当我想摸摸自己的额头时，却发现手指头摸错了地方，啪地拍到了上嘴唇。还有我的鼻子也过于外凸，当我想碰碰我的脸，摸摸其他部位时，鼻子因为目标过大不幸白白挨了两三下。</p>
<p>还有两位先生的交易也让他们陷入同样滑稽荒谬的境地。他们彼此交换了一双罗圈腿和一双老长老长的、没有腿肚子的飞毛腿。于是其中一个看上去就像在踩高跷，整个身子被高高地架在半空，看上去远远超过了他的正常身高，慌得他的脑袋左摇右摆来回直晃，另一个走路的时候就像在原地笨拙地打圈，似乎对于如何调动一双新腿完全不知所措。他看上去像是那种成天笑呵呵的乐天派，于是我用我的手杖戳在地上画了一条直线，告诉他我会在线的一端放一瓶酒，然后打赌他一刻钟内不可能沿着直线走上前去拿到那瓶酒。</p>
<p>这一大堆苦难最后在男女之间分配，他们不堪重负、脚步踉跄，放眼望去是一片凄惨的景象。整片大地上到处都是怨声载道的人们，悲叹、哀号之声不绝于耳。最后，朱庇特大发慈悲，下令让他们再次放下身上的重物，重新背负原先的不幸。人们闻言后欢呼雀跃，而那个把他们带入迷途的女巫也被下令就地消失。由另一位女神取而代之，她的形象与她的前任截然不同：她举止镇定沉着，神态端庄却不失开朗。她不时地仰首凝望苍穹，静静注视着天空深处的朱庇特。她的名字叫作坚忍。她一来到重负山，神奇的情景便出现了，整座山峰突然下沉，露出地面的部分不及先前的三分之一。她随即把每个人的不幸发还给他们，而后教会他们如何以最宽广的胸怀忍受苦难，人们心满意足地带着各自的不幸离开了，庆幸自己不必因为天降横祸般的错误选择而受苦终身。</p>
<p>随着最后几个人渐渐走出视野，我参悟到永远不要抱怨自己的不幸，或是嫉妒他人的幸福，因为一个人永远不可能切身体会到旁人身受的折磨；出于同样的理由，我也决定对于他人的怨言永远不要嗤之以鼻，应带着仁慈、悲悯之心看待同类的苦难。</p>

<p>JUPITER AND TEN</p>
<p>朱庇特和十</p>
<p>James T. Fields, 1817-1881, was born at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
For many years he was partner in the well-known firm of Ticknor &amp;
Fields (Later Fields, Osgood &amp; Co.), the leading publishers of
standard American literature. For eight years, he was chief editor of
the “Atlantic Monthly;” and, after he left that position, he often
enriched its pages by the productions of his pen. During his latter
years Mr. Fields gained some reputation as a lecturer. His literary
abilities were of no mean order: but he did not do so much in producing
literature himself, as in aiding others in its production.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chub was rich and portly,</p>
<p>Mrs. Chub was very grand,</p>
<p>Mrs. Chub was always reckoned</p>
<p>A lady in the land.</p>
<p>You shall see her marble mansion</p>
<p>In a very stately square,—</p>
<p>Mr. C. knows what it cost him,</p>
<p>But that’s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chub was so sagacious,</p>
<p>Such a patron of the arts,</p>
<p>And she gave such foreign orders</p>
<p>That she won all foreign hearts.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chub was always talking,</p>
<p>When she went away from home,</p>
<p>Of a most prodigious painting</p>
<p>Which had just arrived from Rome.</p>
<p>“Such a treasure,” she insisted,</p>
<p>“One might never see again!”</p>
<p>“What’s the subject?” we inquired.</p>
<p>“It is Jupiter and Ten!”</p>
<p>“Ten what?” we blandly asked her</p>
<p>For the knowledge we did lack,</p>
<p>“Ah! that I can not tell you,</p>
<p>But the name is on the back.</p>
<p>“There it stands in printed letters,—</p>
<p>Come to-morrow, gentlemen,—</p>
<p>Come and see our splendid painting,</p>
<p>Our fine Jupiter and Ten!”</p>
<p>When Mrs. Chub departed,</p>
<p>Our brains began to rack,—</p>
<p>She could not be mistaken</p>
<p>For the name was on the back.</p>
<p>So we begged a great Professor</p>
<p>To lay aside his pen,</p>
<p>And give some information</p>
<p>Touching “Jupiter and Ten.”</p>
<p>And we pondered well the subject,</p>
<p>And our Lempriere we turned,</p>
<p>To find out who the Ten were;</p>
<p>But we could not, though we burned.</p>
<p>But when we saw the picture,—</p>
<p>O Mrs. Chub! Oh, fie! O!</p>
<p>We perused the printed label,</p>
<p>And ’t was JUPITER AND IO!</p>

<p>SCENE FROM “THE POOR GENTLEMAN”</p>
<p>《可怜的绅士》中的一场</p>
<p>George Colman, 1762-1836, was the son of George Colman, a writer of
dramas, who in 1777 purchased the “Haymarket Theater,” in London. Owing
to the illness of the father, Colman the younger assumed the management
of the theater in 1785, which post he held for a long time. He was
highly distinguished as a dramatic author and wit. “The Poor Gentleman,”
from which the following selection is adapted, is perhaps the best known
of his works.</p>
<p>SIR ROBERT BRAMBLE and HUMPHREY DOBBINS.</p>
<p>Sir R . I’ll tell you what, Humphrey Dobbins, there is not a syllable
of sense in all you have been saying. But I suppose you will maintain
there is.</p>
<p>Hum . Yes.</p>
<p>Sir R . Yes! Is that the way you talk to me, you old boor? What’s my
name?</p>
<p>Hum . Robert Bramble.</p>
<p>Sir R . An’t I a baronet? Sir Robert Bramble, of Blackberry Hall, in
the county of Kent? ’T is time you should know it, for you have been my
clumsy, two-fisted valet these thirty years: can you deny that?</p>
<p>Hum . Hem!</p>
<p>Sir R . Hem? What do you mean by hem? Open that rusty door of your
mouth, and make your ugly voice walk out of it. Why don’t you answer my
question?</p>
<p>Hum . Because, if I contradict you, I shall tell you a lie, and
whenever I agree with you, you are sure to fall out.</p>
<p>Sir R . Humphrey Dobbins. I have been so long endeavoring to beat a
few brains into your pate that all your hair has tumbled off before my
point is carried.</p>
<p>Hum . What then? Our parson says my head is an emblem of both our
honors.</p>
<p>Sir R . Ay; because honors, like your head, are apt to be empty.</p>
<p>Hum . No; but if a servant has grown bald under his master’s nose, it
looks as if there was honesty on one side, and regard for it on the
other.</p>
<p>Sir R . Why, to be sure, old Humphrey, you are as honest as a—pshaw!
the parson means to palaver us; but, to return to my position, I tell
you I don’t like your flat contradiction.</p>
<p>Hum . Yes, you do.</p>
<p>Sir R . I tell you I don’t. I only love to hear men’s arguments. I
hate their flummery.</p>
<p>Hum . What do you call flummery?</p>
<p>Sir R . Flattery, blockhead! a dish too often served up by paltry
poor men to paltry rich ones.</p>
<p>Hum . I never serve it up to you.</p>
<p>Sir R . No, you give me a dish of a different description.</p>
<p>Hum . Hem! what is it?</p>
<p>Sir R . Sauerkraut, you old crab</p>
<p>Hum . I have held you a stout tug at argument this many a year.</p>
<p>Sir R . And yet I could never teach you a syllogism. Now mind, when a
poor man assents to what a rich man says, I suspect he means to flatter
him: now I am rich, and hate flattery. Ergo—when a poor man subscribes
to my opinion, I hate him.</p>
<p>Hum . That’s wrong.</p>
<p>Sir R . Very well; negatur; now prove it.</p>
<p>Hum . Put the case then, I am a poor man.</p>
<p>Sir R . You an’t, you scoundrel. You know you shall never want while
I have a shilling.</p>
<p>Hum . Bless you!</p>
<p>Sir R . Pshaw! Proceed.</p>
<p>Hum . Well, then, I am a poor—I must be a poor man now, or I never
shall get on.</p>
<p>Sir R . Well, get on, be a poor man.</p>
<p>Hum . I am a poor man, and I argue with you, and convince you, you
are wrong; then you call yourself a blockhead, and I am of your opinion:
now, that’s no flattery.</p>
<p>Sir R . Why, no; but when a man’s of the same opinion with me, he
puts an end to the argument, and that puts an end to the conversation,
and so I hate him for that. But where’s my nephew Frederic?</p>
<p>Hum . Been out these two hours.</p>
<p>Sir R . An undutiful cub! Only arrived from Russia last night, and
though I told him to stay at home till I rose, he’s scampering over the
fields like a Calmuck Tartar.</p>
<p>Hum . He’s a fine fellow.</p>
<p>Sir R . He has a touch of our family. Don’t you think he is a little
like me, Humphrey?</p>
<p>Hum . No, not a bit; you are as ugly an old man as ever I clapped my
eyes on.</p>
<p>Sir R . Now that’s plaguy impudent, but there’s no flattery in it,
and it keeps up the independence of argument. His father, my brother
Job, is of as tame a spirit—Humphrey, you remember my brother Job?</p>
<p>Hum . Yes, you drove him to Russia five and twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Sir R . I did not drive him.</p>
<p>Hum . Yes, you did. You would never let him be at peace in the way of
argument.</p>
<p>Sir R . At peace! Zounds, he would never go to war.</p>
<p>Hum . He had the merit to be calm.</p>
<p>Sir R . So has a duck pond. He was a bit of still life; a chip; weak
water gruel; a tame rabbit, boiled to rags, without sauce or salt. He
received my arguments with his mouth open, like a poorbox gaping for
half-pence, and, good or bad, he swallowed them all without any
resistance. We couldn’t disagree, and so we parted.</p>
<p>Hum . And the poor, meek gentleman went to Russia for a quiet
life.</p>
<p>Sir R . A quiet life! Why, he married the moment he got there, tacked
himself to the shrew relict of a Russian merchant, and continued a
speculation with her in furs, flax, potashes, tallow, linen, and
leather; what’s the consequence? Thirteen months ago he broke.</p>
<p>Hum . Poor soul, his wife should have followed the business for him.
Sir R. I fancy she did follow it, for she died just as he broke, and now
this madcap, Frederic, is sent over to me for protection. Poor Job, now
he is in distress, I must not neglect his son.</p>
<p>Hum . Here comes his son; that’s Mr. Frederic.</p>
<p>Enter FREDERIC.</p>
<p>Fred . Oh, my dear uncle, good morning! Your park is nothing but
beauty.</p>
<p>Sir R . Who bid you caper over my beauty? I told you to stay in doors
till I got up.</p>
<p>Fred . So you did, but I entirely forgot it.</p>
<p>Sir R . And pray, what made you forget it?</p>
<p>Fred . The sun.</p>
<p>Sir R . The sun! he’s mad; you mean the moon, 1 believe.</p>
<p>Fred . Oh, my dear uncle, you don’t know the effect of a fine spring
morning upon a fellow just arrived from Russia. The day looked bright,
trees budding, birds singing, the park was so gay that I took a leap out
of your old balcony, made your deer fly before me like the wind, and
chased them all around the park to get an appetite for breakfast, while
you were snoring in bed, uncle.</p>
<p>Sir R . Oh, oh! So the effect of English sunshine upon a Russian, is
to make him jump out of a balcony, and worry my deer.</p>
<p>Fred . I confess it had that influence upon me.</p>
<p>Sir R . You had better be influenced by a rich old uncle, unless you
think the sun likely to leave you a fat legacy.</p>
<p>Fred . I hate legacies.</p>
<p>Sir R . Sir, that’s mighty singular. They are pretty solid tokens, at
least.</p>
<p>Fred . Very melancholy tokens, uncle; they are the posthumous
dispatches Affection sends to Gratitude, to inform us we have lost a
gracious friend.</p>
<p>Sir R . How charmingly the dog argues!</p>
<p>Fred . But I own my spirits ran away with me this morning. I will
obey you better in future; for they tell me you are a very worthy, good
sort of old gentleman.</p>
<p>Sir R . Now who had the familiar impudence to tell you that? Fred.
Old rusty, there.</p>
<p>Sir R . Why Humphrey, you didn’t?</p>
<p>Hum . Yes, but I did though.</p>
<p>Fred . Yes, he did, and on that score I shall be anxious to show you
obedience, for ’t is as meritorious to attempt sharing a good man’s
heart, as it is paltry to have designs upon a rich man’s money. A noble
nature aims its attentions full breast high, uncle; a mean mind levels
its dirty assiduities at the pocket.</p>
<p>Sir R. (Shaking him by the hand.) Jump out of every window I have in
my house; hunt my deer into high fevers, my fine fellow! Ay, that’s
right. This is spunk, and plain speaking. Give me a man who is always
flinging his dissent to my doctrines smack in my teeth.</p>
<p>Fred . I disagree with you there, uncle.</p>
<p>Hum . And so do I.</p>
<p>Fred . You! you forward puppy! If you were not so old, I’d knock you
down.</p>
<p>Sir R . I’ll knock you down, if you do. I won’t have my servants
thumped into dumb flattery.</p>
<p>Hum . Come, you are ruffled. Let us go to the business of the
morning.</p>
<p>Sir R . I hate the business of the morning. Don’t you see we are
engaged in discussion. I tell you, I hate the business of the
morning.</p>
<p>Hum . No you don’t.</p>
<p>Sir R . Don’t I? Why not?</p>
<p>Hum . Because ’t is charity.</p>
<p>Sir R . Pshaw! Well, we must not neglect the business, if there be
any distress in the parish. Read the list, Humphrey.</p>
<p>Hum. (Taking out a paper and reading.) “Jonathan Huggins, of Muck
Mead, is put in prison for debt.”</p>
<p>Sir R . Why, it was only last week that Gripe, the attorney,
recovered two cottages for him by law, worth sixty pounds.</p>
<p>Hum . Yes, and charged a hundred for his trouble; so seized the
cottages for part of his bill, and threw Jonathan into jail for the
remainder.</p>
<p>Sir R . A harpy! I must relieve the poor fellow’s distress.</p>
<p>Fred . And I must kick his attorney.</p>
<p>Hum. (Reading.) “The curate’s horse is dead.”</p>
<p>Sir R . Pshaw! There’s no distress in that.</p>
<p>Hum . Yes, there is, to a man that must go twenty miles every Sunday
to preach three sermons, for thirty pounds a year.</p>
<p>Sir R . Why won’t the vicar give him another nag?</p>
<p>Hum . Because ’t is cheaper to get another curate ready mounted.</p>
<p>Sir R . Well, send him the black pad which I purchased last Tuesday,
and tell him to work him as long as he lives. What else have we upon the
list?</p>
<p>Hum . Something out of the common; there’s one Lieutenant
Worthington, a disabled officer and a widower, come to lodge at Farmer
Harrowby’s, in the village; he is, it seems, very poor, and more proud
than poor, and more honest than proud.</p>
<p>Sir R . And so he sends to me for assistance? Hum. He’d see you
hanged first! No, he’d sooner die than ask you or any man for a
shilling! There’s his daughter, and his wife’s aunt, and an old corporal
that served in the wars with him, he keeps them all upon his half
pay.</p>
<p>Sir R . Starves them all, I’m afraid, Humphrey.</p>
<p>Fred. (Going.) Good morning, uncle.</p>
<p>Sir R . You rogue, where are you running now?</p>
<p>Fred . To talk with Lieutenant Worthington.</p>
<p>Sir R . And what may you be going to say to him?</p>
<p>Fred . I can’t tell till I encounter him; and then, uncle, when I
have an old gentleman by the hand, who has been disabled in his
country’s service, and is struggling to support his motherless child, a
poor relation, and a faithful servant, in honorable indigence, impulse
will supply me with words to express my sentiments.</p>
<p>Sir R . Stop, you rogue; I must be before you in this business.</p>
<p>Fred . That depends on who can run the fastest; so, start fair,
uncle, and here goes.—(Runs out.)</p>
<p>Sir R . Stop, stop; why, Frederic—a jackanapes—to take my department
out of my hands! I’ll disinherit the dog for his assurance.</p>
<p>Hum . No, you won’t.</p>
<p>Sir R . Won’t I? Hang me if I—but we’ll argue that point as we go.
So, come along Humphrey.</p>

<p>罗伯特·勃兰堡爵士和汉弗莱·道宾斯</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
知道我要对你说什么吧，你刚才所说的从头到尾都毫无意义。不过我想你肯定还以为自己很有道理呢。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 没错。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 没错！你敢这么跟我说话，你这个老家伙？知道我是谁吗？</p>
<p>汉弗莱 罗伯特·勃兰堡。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
知不知道我是准男爵？肯特郡布莱克贝利城堡的罗伯特·勃兰堡准男爵！这不用我提醒你吧，你这个蠢东西在我身边笨手笨脚地伺候了三十年；这一点你不会否认吧？</p>
<p>汉弗莱 哼！</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
哼？你哼什么哼？给我撬开你这张笨嘴，让我听听你那难以入耳的声音。为什么不回答我的问题？</p>
<p>汉弗莱
如果我说不是，那无疑是在撒谎，可如果我说是，你肯定会暴跳如雷。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
汉弗莱·道宾斯。一直以来我都想往你榆木脑袋里塞些脑仁，省得我担心哪天我话还没说明白，你就把自己拽成了个秃瓢。</p>
<p>汉弗莱
那又怎样？咱们教区的牧师说了，我的脑袋可代表了我们两个人的体面。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 唉，因为要真像你的脑袋，体面也就啥也不是了。</p>
<p>汉弗莱
不对；但要是一个仆人敢公然跟他主子叫板，这一来好像可以说明仆人老实，二来也可以看得出主人看重这份老实。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
啊哟，老汉弗莱，你老实？我呸！牧师不过是顺嘴奉承两句；你可别忘了自己姓甚名谁，老实告诉你，我可不喜欢你这种站不住脚的强词夺理。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 你喜欢的。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
告诉你我不喜欢。我只喜欢听别人把道理辩个一清二楚。我讨厌毫无诚意的溜须拍马。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 溜须拍马是啥意思？</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
就是拍马屁，你这个笨蛋！就像是蠢笨的穷人巴结没脑子富人的惯用伎俩，老是这道菜，吃都吃腻了。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 我可从没给您上过这道菜。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 那倒是，你端上来的菜跟他们可不一样。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 哼！什么菜？</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 泡菜，你这个老东西。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 这些年每次争吵咱两总是互不相让。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
我还没教你三段论。现在听好了，如果一个穷人总是同意一个富人说的话，我就会怀疑他是想恭维他：现在我是个富人，讨厌恭维。因此——当一个穷人赞同我的观点，我就会感到无比厌恶。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 这话不对。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 很好；说我不对；那你来证明看看为什么不对。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 就拿这事来说吧，我是个穷光蛋。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
你才不是呢，你这混蛋。你清楚只要我有一个先令，就不会让你挨饿受冻。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 上帝保佑！</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 啐！继续说。</p>
<p>汉弗莱
那好，我很穷——现在你必须承认我是个穷光蛋，要不我没法往下说。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 好吧，继续，就算你是个穷光蛋。</p>
<p>汉弗莱
我是穷人，我在跟您争论，想要说服您相信，刚才您说错了；然后你就管自己叫笨蛋，我同意你的说法，这就不叫拍马奉承。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
哎哟，的确不算。但是如果有人赞同我的观点，那辩论就走到了头，他让我们的对话无以为继了，我可不喜欢这样。对了，我侄子弗雷德里克去哪儿了？</p>
<p>汉弗莱 都出去两钟头了。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
这个目无尊长的家伙！昨晚才从俄罗斯回来，我明明让他呆在家里等我起来的，可他倒好，像个卡尔马克鞑靼人一样到处乱跑。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 这个小伙子人不错。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
他也算是和我们家族沾亲带故。汉弗莱，难道你不认为他眉宇之间和我有几分相似吗？</p>
<p>汉弗莱 一点都不像；您是我见过的最难看的老头。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
越说越放肆了，不过这话里头倒是没丁点阿谀奉承，这样咱俩才能继续针锋相对。他父亲，也就是我的兄弟约伯，那个胆小鬼——汉弗莱，你记得吗？</p>
<p>汉弗莱 记得，就是二十五年前被你发配到俄罗斯的那个。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 我可没有发配他。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 你就是。你们两个每次争吵，你都会拖住他不让他休战。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 休战！咄，他压根就不会参战。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 安静平和是他的优点。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
鸭塘也很安静。他终日死气沉沉；这没用的东西；就像一碗撩不起米粒的稀粥；一只生前胆小、死后被煮得稀烂的兔子，没有撒盐，不蘸酱汁，淡不啦叽，毫无滋味。一跟他争辩，他就张着他那张嘴，好像一个巴巴等着一钱半文施舍的济贫捐助箱，无论好坏，他都逆来顺受地全部咽下。我俩永远不可能意见不合，所以就分道扬镳了。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 于是可怜温顺的先生就去了俄罗斯，总算可以开始平静地生活了。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
平静的生活！哎哟，在俄罗斯一落脚他就结了婚，娶了当地刁滑的商人寡妇为妻，这两口子接二连三地投机倒把，皮毛、亚麻、钾盐、油脂、麻布、皮革；结果呢？十三个月前，他破产了。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 可怜的人，他妻子应该和他共患难的。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
我想她的确那么做了，因为他刚破产，她就一命呜呼了，现在，这个鲁莽冲动的弗雷德里克跑来投奔我。可怜的约伯，眼下他正处境艰难，他的儿子我要是能帮衬一把，我自然不会推脱的。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 说来就来，那可不就是弗雷德里克。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 上场。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 哦，我亲爱的叔叔，早上好！您家的花园可真是美不胜收啊。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
谁让你在花园里疯跑来着？我嘱咐过让你呆在屋里等我起床的。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 您是说过，可我给忘了。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 那恳求你告诉我，是什么让你把我的嘱咐抛之脑后的？</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 太阳。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 太阳！这孩子不是疯了吧；我想你指的是月亮吧。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克
哦，我亲爱的叔叔，您可体会不了一个美好的春日早晨对一个刚从俄罗斯回来的人来说意味着什么。天色如此明朗，树木吐露新芽，鸟儿齐声欢唱，花园里举目皆是欣欣向荣的好风光，所以我就翻身一跃，跳出了老旧的阳台，惊得你家的梅花鹿一阵风似地逃开了，叔叔，当你躺在床上打鼾的时候，我正在鹿群后面疯赶狂追，好让自己胃口大开，美美地吃上一顿早餐。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
哦，我的老天!英国的阳光对俄国人竟有如此大的吸引力，能让他跳出阳台，惊扰我的梅花鹿。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 我得说它的影响力对我而言就是这般巨大。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
除非你认为阳光会给你留下一大笔遗产，要不你最好还是想想你富有的老叔叔的影响力吧。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 我讨厌遗产。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
先生，你这言论可真是闻所未闻。至少，遗产是实打实的财富的象征。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克
是悲伤的象征，叔叔；遗产像是死后寄出的邮件，发信人是爱，收件人是感谢，宣告着我们失去了一位至亲的朋友。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 听听这孩子的话说得多漂亮啊！</p>
<p>弗雷德里克
不过今天早晨我的确有些随心所欲了。日后我会更听您的话；他们都说您非常受人敬仰，是一位正直的老绅士。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 是哪个竟然敢这么放肆，告诉你这些的？</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 那个倔老头呗。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 哦汉弗莱，不会是你这么口无遮拦吧？</p>
<p>汉弗莱 嗯，就是我。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克
是的，正是他说的，就是因为他这么说了我才急于向您表白对您的恭顺之心，因为就像试图拥有一个好人的善心是一件应该获得嘉许的事一样，觊觎一位富人的钱财就是一种无比卑劣的行径。一颗高贵的心灵会无比热忱地向广阔的胸襟看齐，叔叔；而卑鄙的念头只会对牢别人的口袋大献殷勤。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
（摇着弗雷德里克的手）你可以从我家任何一扇窗户跳出去；把我家的梅花鹿追得口吐白沫也没关系，我的好孩子！呀，说得不错。有什么说什么，勇气可嘉。我身边就想要一个我说东他偏指西的家伙。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 您这么说，我可承受不起。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 我也这么觉得。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克
你！你这个胆大包天的奴才！要不是看在你一把年纪的份上，我一定把你揍得满地找牙。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
你要是敢这么做，我先把你给揍趴下喽。我可不会眼睁睁地看着我的仆人被人用拳头调教成一个只会阿谀奉承的蠢奴才。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 瞧，您都生气了。上午还有事儿没处理完呢。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
我讨厌这些破事。没见我们正一门心思地在争论嘛。告诉你，我讨厌上午那些破事。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 您才不会呢。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 不会？为什么这么说？</p>
<p>汉弗莱 因为是有关慈善的。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
啐！好吧，若是咱们教区真有人生活在疾苦之中，这个事我们倒是当真不能不管不顾的。读一下名单，汉弗莱。</p>
<p>汉弗莱
（取出一张纸，开始念。）“淤泥草地的乔纳森·哈金森，因为欠债被关进了监狱。”</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
老天，就在上个礼拜，格里普律师不是才帮他依法要回了两间价值六十镑的小屋吗？</p>
<p>汉弗莱
没错，但律师管他要一百镑律师费；于是他的小屋被没收抵债，剩下的部分他拿不出钱，所以被关进了监狱。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 那律师想钱想疯了吧！我一定要把可怜的家伙给搭救出来。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 我一定要踹上他一脚。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 （念）“助理牧师的马死了。”</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 啐！这算哪门子困难疾苦。</p>
<p>汉弗莱
当然算了，对一位年收入三十英镑、每个礼拜天都要赶二十里地去做3场布道的人来说，马死了可算不得小事。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 那牧师为什么不另给他找匹马？</p>
<p>汉弗莱 因为换人比换马便宜。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
好吧，就把我上礼拜三买的那匹黑蹄马给他，告诉他这马有生之年都归他使用了。名单上还有谁？</p>
<p>汉弗莱
这个有点不同寻常。有个叫沃辛顿的上尉，是个死了老婆的残疾军官，暂时住在村里的哈罗比农夫家。他好像很穷，但穷得很有骨气，而且非常诚实。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 所以他就来向我求助？</p>
<p>汉弗莱
那他宁可上吊。不，他到死都不会问你或其他任何人伸手要一个先令的！他有一个女儿、他老婆的阿姨、还有一个打仗时一直追随他的下士要养活，这得花费他一半的抚恤金。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 汉弗莱，恐怕他们都得饿死。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 （离场）再见，叔叔。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 你这个调皮鬼，又要上哪儿去？</p>
<p>弗雷德里克 去和沃辛顿上尉聊聊。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 你准备和他聊什么？</p>
<p>弗雷德里克
那要等见到他才知道；还有，叔叔，一个人为国参战落下残疾，现在安于清贫，全靠一己之力供养一个失去母亲的孩子，一个一贫如洗的亲眷，还有一个忠心耿耿的随从，要是我身边有这样一位上了年纪的先生，我肯定会迫不及待地跑去向他表达敬意的。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士 住口，你这黄毛小子；这事要做也是我来做。</p>
<p>弗雷德里克
那就得看谁跑得快了；现在起跑，谁都别赖皮，叔叔，我们开始。（跑开了。）</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
停下，停下；哎哟，弗雷德里克——你这个猴子投胎的家伙——我还没死呢就这么无法无天！我的遗产他肯定没份。</p>
<p>汉弗莱 您不会那么做的。</p>
<p>罗伯特爵士
我不会？等着瞧吧——不过关于这点我们边走边说说清楚。来吧，汉弗莱，现在就动身。</p>

<p>MY MOTHER’S PICTURE</p>
<p>母亲的画像</p>
<p>William Cowper, 1731-1800, was the son of an English clergyman; both
his parents were descended from noble families. He was always of a
gentle, timid disposition; and the roughness of his schoolfellows
increased his weakness in this respect. He studied law, and was admitted
to the bar, but never practiced his profession. When he was about thirty
years of age, he was appointed to a clerkship in the House of Lords, but
could not summon courage to enter upon the discharge of its duties. He
was so disturbed by this affair that he became insane, sought to destroy
himself, and had to be consigned to a private asylum. Soon after his
recovery, he found a congenial home in the family of the Rev. Mr. Unwin.
On the death of this gentleman, a few years later, he continued to
reside with his widow till her death, a short time before that of
Cowper. Most of this time their home was at Olney. His first writings
were published in 1782. He wrote several beautiful hymns, “The Task,”and
some minor poems. These, with his translations of Homer and his
correspondence, make up his published works. His life was always pure
and gentle; he took great pleasure in simple, natural objects, and in
playing with animals. His insanity returned from time to time, and
darkened his life at its close. When six years of age, he lost his
mother; and the following selection is part of a touching tribute to her
memory, written many years later.</p>
<p>Oh that those lips had language! Life has passed</p>
<p>With me but roughly since I heard them last.</p>
<p>My mother, when I learned that thou wast dead,</p>
<p>Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?</p>
<p>Hovered thy spirit o’er thy sorrowing son,</p>
<p>Wretch even then, life’s journey just begun?</p>
<p>Perhaps thou gavest me, though unfelt, a kiss,</p>
<p>Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss.</p>
<p>Ah, that maternal smile! it answers—Yes!</p>
<p>I heard the bell tolled on thy burial day;</p>
<p>I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away;</p>
<p>And, turning from my nursery window, drew</p>
<p>A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!</p>
<p>But was it such? It was. Where thou art gone,</p>
<p>Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown.</p>
<p>May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,</p>
<p>The parting word shall pass my lips no more.</p>
<p>Thy maidens, grieved themselves at my concern,</p>
<p>Oft gave me promise of thy quick return;</p>
<p>What ardently I wished, I long believed;</p>
<p>And, disappointed still, was still deceived;</p>
<p>By expectation, every day beguiled,</p>
<p>Dupe of to-morrow, even when a child.</p>
<p>Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went,</p>
<p>Till, all my stock of infant sorrows spent,</p>
<p>I learned at last submission to my lot;</p>
<p>But, though I less deplored thee, ne’er forgot.</p>
<p>My boast is not that I deduce my birth</p>
<p>From loins enthroned, and rulers of the earth;</p>
<p>But higher far my proud pretensions rise,—</p>
<p>The son of parents passed into the skies.</p>
<p>And now, farewell! Time, unrevoked, has run</p>
<p>His wonted course, yet what I wished is done.</p>
<p>By Contemplation’s help, not sought in vain,</p>
<p>I seem to have lived my childhood o’er again;</p>
<p>To have renewed the joys that once were mine,</p>
<p>Without the sin of violating thine;</p>
<p>And, while the wings of Fancy still are free,</p>
<p>And I can view this mimic show of thee,</p>
<p>Time has but half succeeded in his theft,—</p>
<p>Thyself removed, thy power to soothe me left.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-531">中文阅读</h4>
<p>那嘴唇曾在我耳边轻言软语！自从它消失后</p>
<p>人生道路变得坎坷崎岖。</p>
<p>我的母亲，当我得知你已离我而去</p>
<p>你可知道你的孩子泪落如雨？</p>
<p>你的魂魄徘徊在头顶，看着伤心的我不舍离去，</p>
<p>我哭闹不休：你真的要走，在我的人生刚开始的时候？</p>
<p>或许你轻轻落下一个吻，虽然我已无法体会，</p>
<p>或许你轻轻垂落一滴泪，如果天国的灵魂也会伤悲。</p>
<p>啊，你的微笑充满慈悲！它静静地回答——身不由己，宝贝！</p>
<p>葬礼那天，我听见丧钟沉沉响起；</p>
<p>我看见载着你的灵车慢慢远离；</p>
<p>从保育室的窗口我背过身去</p>
<p>长长地叹息，声声哀号就是最后道别的话语!</p>
<p>难道这一别竟是永别？是的，因为你要去的地方</p>
<p>让所有的再见都变得不复相见。</p>
<p>但愿有一天我能在那静谧的彼岸与你团聚，</p>
<p>只有那时，离别的话语再也不会逗留唇际。</p>
<p>我的处境让侍女们肝肠寸断，</p>
<p>她们总是安慰我你去去就还；</p>
<p>我深信不疑，我虔诚期盼；</p>
<p>然而，今日哄骗，明日欺瞒；</p>
<p>即便是孩子也开始明白，</p>
<p>所谓的希望终将被失望掩埋。</p>
<p>一个个伤心的明天去了又来，</p>
<p>直到耗尽了童年所有的悲哀，</p>
<p>最后我只好向命运低头，不再等待；</p>
<p>虽然哀伤不再刺痛，但我从来不曾忘怀。</p>
<p>主教的后裔或是君主的子孙</p>
<p>都不会成为我炫耀的资本；</p>
<p>然而内心的骄傲，它不断地升腾——</p>
<p>因为天堂里安息着我父母的灵魂。</p>
<p>现在，要说永别了！岁月无情，</p>
<p>总是有去无回，然而我的期盼已在心底永存。</p>
<p>凝望你的相片，我终于找到了方向，</p>
<p>恍惚回到了从前，无忧无虑的童年；</p>
<p>重新温习那曾经属于我的短暂欢悦，</p>
<p>我会承欢膝下，不再调皮捣蛋；</p>
<p>幻想为我安上翅膀，在回忆里恣意翱翔，</p>
<p>我看到了你，音容依旧，宛若当年，</p>
<p>岁月是个小偷，可他只得逞了一半——</p>
<p>虽然把你带走，却将抚慰我心的力量永留身畔。</p>

<p>DEATH OF SAMSON</p>
<p>参孙之死</p>
<p>John Milton, 1608-1674, was born in London—eight years before the
greatest English poet, Shakespeare, died. His father followed the
profession of a scrivener, in which he acquired a competence. As a boy,
Milton was exceedingly studious, continuing his studies till midnight.
He graduated at Christ’s College, Cambridge, where his singular beauty,
his slight figure, and his fastidious morality caused his companions to
nickname him “the lady of Christ’s.” On leaving college he spent five
years more in study, and produced his lighter poems. He then traveled on
the continent, returning about the time the civil war broke out. For a
time he taught a private school, but soon threw himself with all the
power of his able and tried pen into the political struggle. He was the
champion of Parliament and of Cromwell for about twenty years. On the
accession of Charles II., he concealed himself for a time, but was soon
allowed to live quietly in London. His eyesight had totally failed in
1654; but now, in blindness, age, family affliction, and comparative
poverty, he produced his great work “Paradise Lost.” In 1667 he sold the
poem for 5 Pounds in cash, with a promise of 10 Pounds more on certain
contingencies; the sum total received by himself and family for the
immortal poem, was 23 Pounds. Later, he produced “Paradise Regained” and
“Samson Agonistes,” from the latter of which the following extract is
taken. Milton is a wonderful example of a man, who, by the greatness of
his own mind, triumphed over trials, afflictions, hardships, and the
evil influence of bitter political controversy.</p>
<p>Occasions drew me early to this city;</p>
<p>And, as the gates I entered with sunrise,</p>
<p>The morning trumpets festival proclaimed</p>
<p>Through each high street: little I had dispatched,</p>
<p>When all abroad was rumored that this day</p>
<p>Samson should be brought forth, to show the people</p>
<p>Proof of his mighty strength in feats and games.</p>
<p>I sorrowed at his captive state,</p>
<p>But minded not to be absent at that spectacle.</p>
<p>The building was a spacious theater</p>
<p>Half-round, on two main pillars vaulted high,</p>
<p>With seats where all the lords, and each degree</p>
<p>Of sort, might sit in order to behold;</p>
<p>The other side was open, where the throng</p>
<p>On banks and scaffolds under sky might stand:</p>
<p>I among these aloof obscurely stood.</p>
<p>The feast and noon grew high, and sacrifice</p>
<p>Had filled their hearts with mirth, high cheer, and wine,</p>
<p>When to their sports they turned. Immediately</p>
<p>Was Samson as a public servant brought,</p>
<p>In their state livery clad: before him pipes</p>
<p>And timbrels; on each side went arme’d guards;</p>
<p>Both horse and foot before him and behind,</p>
<p>Archers and slingers, cataphracts, and spears.</p>
<p>At sight of him the people with a shout</p>
<p>Rifted the air, clamoring their god with praise,</p>
<p>Who had made their dreadful enemy their thrall.</p>
<p>He, patient, but undaunted, where they led him,</p>
<p>Came to the place; and what was set before him,</p>
<p>Which without help of eye might be essayed,</p>
<p>To heave, pull, draw, or break, he still performed</p>
<p>All with incredible, stupendous force,</p>
<p>None daring to appear antagonist.</p>
<p>At length for intermission sake, they led him</p>
<p>Between the pillars; he his guide requested,</p>
<p>As overtired, to let him lean awhile</p>
<p>With both his arms on those two massy pillars,</p>
<p>That to the arche’d roof gave main support.</p>
<p>He unsuspicious led him; which when Samson</p>
<p>Felt in his arms, with head awhile inclined,</p>
<p>And eyes fast fixed, he stood, as one who prayed,</p>
<p>Or some great matter in his mind revolved:</p>
<p>At last, with head erect, thus cried aloud:—</p>
<p>“Hitherto, lords, what your commands imposed</p>
<p>I have performed, as reason was, obeying,</p>
<p>Not without wonder or delight beheld;</p>
<p>Now, of my own accord, such other trial</p>
<p>I mean to show you of my strength yet greater,</p>
<p>As with amaze shall strike all who behold.”</p>
<p>This uttered, straining all his nerves, he bowed;</p>
<p>As with the force of winds and waters pent</p>
<p>When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars</p>
<p>With horrible convulsion to and fro</p>
<p>He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew</p>
<p>The whole roof after them with burst of thunder</p>
<p>Upon the heads of all who sat beneath,—</p>
<p>Lords, ladies, captains, counselors, or priests,</p>
<p>Their choice nobility and flower, not only</p>
<p>Of this, but each Philistian city round,</p>
<p>Met from all parts to solemnize this feast.</p>
<p>Samson, with these immixed, inevitably</p>
<p>Pulled down the same destruction on himself;</p>
<p>The vulgar only ’scaped who stood without.</p>

<p>一大清早我就进城办事；</p>

<p>我已言听计从全部完成，</p>
<p>虽说精彩，却不至让人弹眼落睛，</p>
<p>现在我出于自愿再露一手，</p>
<p>请诸位见识更厉害的神力，</p>
<p>让在场观众都大吃一惊。</p>
<p>话音一落，他便俯身</p>
<p>绷紧全身的神经，</p>
<p>就像暴风狂飙，山洪奔泻，</p>
<p>力量之大如同地动山摇</p>
<p>他用尽全力拼命来回摇晃两个柱子，</p>
<p>直至伴着雷鸣，柱子牵扯着屋顶</p>
<p>轰然倒下——</p>

<p>AN EVENING ADVENTURE</p>
<p>夜晚奇遇</p>
<p>Not long since, a gentleman was traveling in one of the counties of
Virginia, and about the close of the day stopped at a public house to
obtain refreshment and spend the night. He had been there but a short
time, before an old man alighted from his gig, with the apparent
intention of becoming his fellow guest at the same house.</p>
<p>As the old man drove up, he observed that both the shafts of his gig
were broken, and that they were held together by withes, formed from the
bark of a hickory sapling. Our traveler observed further that he was
plainly clad, that his knee buckles were loosened, and that something
like negligence pervaded his dress. Conceiving him to be one of the
honest yeomanry of our land, the courtesies of strangers passed between
them, and they entered the tavern. It was about the same time, that an
addition of three or four young gentlemen was made to their number;
most, if not all of them, of the legal profession.</p>
<p>As soon as they became conveniently accommodated, the conversation
was turned, by one of the latter, upon the eloquent harangue which had
that day been displayed at the bar. It was replied by the other that he
had witnessed, the same day, a degree of eloquence no doubt equal, but
it was from the pulpit. Something like a sarcastic rejoinder was made as
to the eloquence of the pulpit, and a warm and able altercation ensued,
in which the merits of the Christian religion became the subject of
discussion. From six o’clock until eleven, the young champions wielded
the sword of argument, adducing with ingenuity and ability everything
that could be said pro and con.</p>
<p>During this protracted period, the old gentleman listened with the
meekness and modesty of a child, as if he were adding new information to
the stores of his own mind; or perhaps he was observing, with a
philosophic eye, the faculties of the youthful mind, and how new
energies are evolved by repeated action; or perhaps, with patriotic
emotion, he was reflecting upon the future destinies of his country, and
on the rising generation, upon whom those future destinies must devolve;
or, most probably, with a sentiment of moral and religious feeling, he
was collecting an argument which no art would be “able to elude, and no
force to resist.” Our traveler remained a spectator, and took no part in
what was said.</p>
<p>At last one of the young men, remarking that it was impossible to
combat with long and established prejudices, wheeled around, and with
some familiarity exclaimed, “Well, my old gentleman, what think you of
these things?” “If,” said the traveler, “a streak of vivid lightning had
at that moment crossed the room, their amazement could not have been
greater than it was from what followed.” The most eloquent and
unanswerable appeal that he had ever heard or read, was made for nearly
an hour by the old gentleman. So perfect was his recollection, that
every argument urged against the Christian religion was met in the order
in which it was advanced. Hume’s sophistry on the subject of miracles,
was, if possible, more perfectly answered than it had already been done
by Campbell. And in the whole lecture there was so much simplicity and
energy, pathos and sublimity, that not another word was uttered.</p>
<p>“An attempt to describe it,” said the traveler, “would be an attempt
to paint the sunbeams.” It was now a matter of curiosity and inquiry who
the old gentleman was. The traveler concluded that it was the preacher
from whom the pulpit eloquence was heard; but no, it was John Marshall,
the Chief Justice of the United States.</p>

<p>不久前，有位绅士在弗吉尼亚州乡间游历，大约黄昏时分他来到一家小旅馆，准备在那里好好休整一个晚上。他刚到那儿不久，门外就有个老人下了马车，很明显，他也想在那儿过上一夜。</p>
<p>就在老汉驾车过来的时候，旅人发现老汉马车的两个辕杆都已断开，草草地用细枝条捆绑起来，那细枝条一看就知道是用山核桃木树苗的树皮搓制而成。再一打量，旅人注意到老汉衣着朴素，膝扣都松开了，穿着打扮很是不修边幅。估计他是当地老实巴交的农民，大家都客气地打了招呼，然后走进旅馆。就在这时，又有三四个年轻人加入住店的行列，他们中的大部分看上去都像是从事法律行业的。</p>
<p>他们稍事安顿后，后来的一拨人中就有一个开始口若悬河，在酒吧里展开了一番高谈阔论，反驳他的是另一个年轻人，他同样滔滔不绝，说得头头是道，精彩的程度丝毫不亚于旅人在同一天里听过的一位牧师的长篇大论。双方如同在教堂布道一般妙语连珠，激烈交锋，就基督教的功过展开了一场热情洋溢，激动人心的争论。从六点到九点，年轻的雄辩者们唇枪舌剑，无所不用其极，他们旁征博引，将一件事情的正面反面论述得淋漓尽致。</p>
<p>在这场持久的争论中，老人始终带着孩子般的温驯与腼腆侧耳聆听，就像是要为他已有的知识储备添砖加瓦，或是以他洞悉一切的眼光剖析研究年轻人的思想，看看这番你来我往中如何迸发出新的火花；又或者，满怀爱国激情的他正在仔细思量国家的前途，揣测这群后起之秀能否肩负起建设国家未来的使命；最有可能的是，他正以道德的忠贞和宗教的虔诚为自己的论点打着腹稿，这篇论稿将把所有人说得理屈词穷，哑口无言。旅人始终在一旁观望，没有参与这场热火朝天的辩论。</p>
<p>最后，一个年轻人宣称长期存在的偏见是难以战胜，一个转身，带着些许狂放不羁喊道，“好吧，老先生，对此您有何高见？”“如果，”旅人说，“当时有一道刺眼的闪电骤然劈进房间，比起之后发生的事情，也不会让在场的所有人更加吃惊。”因为，接下来，那位老人滔滔不绝地说了将近一个小时，口才之好、论述之无可辩驳是这位旅人闻所未闻的，见所未见的。老人记忆力超群，针对之前反对基督教的言论他依次加以反驳。坎贝尔曾经驳斥了休谟关于奇迹的诡辩，然而若是这位老人有机会和休谟针锋相对，精彩程度肯定更甚于坎贝尔。他的演说简明扼要、激情四射，充满了悲悯的情怀和崇高的节操，待他话音落下，在场鸦雀无声，众人无不心服口服。</p>
<p>“要想形容那场雄辩，”旅人说，“那无疑比将阳光绘于纸上更难。”现在让人感到无比好奇并想一探究竟的是那个老人到底是谁。旅人觉得他是那个能言善辩的牧师；可惜他错了，老人是约翰·马歇尔，美利坚合众国最高法院的首席法官。</p>

<p>THE BAREFOOT BOY</p>
<p>赤脚男孩</p>
<p>John Greenleaf Whittier, 1807-1892, was born in Haverhill, Mass.,
and, with short intervals of absence, he always resided in that
vicinity. His parents were Friends or “Quakers,” and he always held to
the same faith. He spent his boyhood on a farm, occasionally writing
verses for the papers even then. Two years of study in the academy seem
to have given him all the special opportunity for education that he ever
enjoyed. In 1829 he edited a newspaper in Boston, and the next year
assumed a similar position in Hartford. For two years he was a member of
the Massachusetts legislature. In 1836 he edited an anti-slavery paper
in Philadelphia, and was secretary of the American Anti-Slavery Society.
Mr. Whittier wrote extensively both in prose and verse. During the later
years of his life he published several volumes of poems, and contributed
frequently to the pages of the “Atlantic Monthly.” An earnest opponent
of slavery, some of his poems bearing on that subject are fiery and even
bitter; but, in general, their sentiment is gentle, and often pathetic.
As a poet, he took rank among those most highly esteemed by his
countrymen. “Snow-Bound,” published in 1805, is one of the longest and
best of his poems. Several of his shorter pieces are marked by much
smoothness and sweetness.</p>
<p>Blessings on thee, little man,</p>
<p>Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan!</p>
<p>With thy turned-up pantaloons,</p>
<p>And thy merry whistled tunes;</p>
<p>With thy red lip, redder still</p>
<p>Kissed by strawberries on the hill;</p>
<p>With the sunshine on thy face,</p>
<p>Through thy torn brim’s jaunty grace;</p>
<p>From my heart I give thee joy,—</p>
<p>I was once a barefoot boy!</p>
<p>Prince thou art,—the grown-up man</p>
<p>Only is republican.</p>
<p>Let the million-dollared ride!</p>
<p>Barefoot, trudging, at his side,</p>
<p>Thou hast more than he can buy</p>
<p>In the reach of ear and eye,—</p>
<p>Outward sunshine, inward joy:</p>
<p>Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!</p>
<p>Oh for boyhood’s painless play,</p>
<p>Sleep that wakes in laughing day,</p>
<p>Health that mocks the doctor’s rules,</p>
<p>Knowledge never learned of schools,</p>
<p>Of the wild bee’s morning chase,</p>
<p>Of the wild flower’s time and place,</p>
<p>Flight of fowl and habitude</p>
<p>Of the tenants of the wood;</p>
<p>How the tortoise bears his shell,</p>
<p>How the woodchuck digs his cell,</p>
<p>And the ground mole sinks his well</p>
<p>How the robin feeds her young,</p>
<p>How the oriole’s nest is hung;</p>
<p>Where the whitest lilies blow,</p>
<p>Where the freshest berries grow,</p>
<p>Where the groundnut trails its vine,</p>
<p>Where the wood grape’s clusters shine;</p>
<p>Of the black wasp’s cunning way,</p>
<p>Mason of his walls of clay,</p>
<p>And the architectural plans</p>
<p>Of gray hornet artisans!—</p>
<p>For, eschewing books and tasks,</p>
<p>Nature answers all he asks;</p>
<p>Hand in hand with her he walks,</p>
<p>Face to face with her he talks,</p>
<p>Part and parcel of her joy,—</p>
<p>Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!</p>
<p>Oh for boyhood’s time of June,</p>
<p>Crowding years in one brief moon,</p>
<p>When all things I heard or saw</p>
<p>Me, their master, waited for.</p>
<p>I was rich in flowers and trees,</p>
<p>Humming birds and honeybees;</p>
<p>For my sport the squirrel played,</p>
<p>Plied the snouted mole his spade;</p>
<p>For my taste the blackberry cone</p>
<p>Purpled over hedge and stone;</p>
<p>Laughed the brook for my delight</p>
<p>Through the day and through the night,</p>
<p>Whispering at the garden wall,</p>
<p>Talked with me from fall to fall;</p>
<p>Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond,</p>
<p>Mine the walnut slopes beyond,</p>
<p>Mine, on bending orchard trees,</p>
<p>Apples of Hesperides!</p>
<p>Still, as my horizon grew,</p>
<p>Larger grew my riches too;</p>
<p>All the world I saw or knew</p>
<p>Seemed a complex Chinese toy,</p>
<p>Fashioned for a barefoot boy!</p>
<p>Oh for festal dainties spread,</p>
<p>Like my bowl of milk and bread,—</p>
<p>Pewter spoon and bowl of wood,</p>
<p>On the doorstone, gray and rude!</p>
<p>O’er me, like a regal tent,</p>
<p>Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent,</p>
<p>Purple-curtained, fringed with gold,</p>
<p>Looped in many a wind-swung fold;</p>
<p>While for music came the play</p>
<p>Of the pied frog’s orchestra;</p>
<p>And to light the noisy choir,</p>
<p>Lit the fly his lamp of fire.</p>
<p>I was monarch: pomp and joy</p>
<p>Waited on the barefoot boy!</p>
<p>Cheerily, then, my little man,</p>
<p>Live and laugh, as boyhood can!</p>
<p>Though the flinty slopes be hard,</p>
<p>Stubble-speared the new-mown sward,</p>
<p>Every morn shall lead thee through</p>
<p>Fresh baptisms of the dew;</p>
<p>Every evening from thy feet</p>
<p>Shall the cool wind kiss the heat:</p>
<p>All too soon these feet must hide</p>
<p>In the prison cells of pride,</p>
<p>Lose the freedom of the sod,</p>
<p>Like a colt’s for work be shod,</p>
<p>Made to tread the mills of toil,</p>
<p>Up and down in ceaseless moil:</p>
<p>Happy if their track be found</p>
<p>Never on forbidden ground;</p>
<p>Happy if they sink not in</p>
<p>Quick and treacherous sands of sin.</p>
<p>Ah! that thou shouldst know thy joy</p>
<p>Ere it passes, barefoot boy!</p>

<p>THE GLOVE AND THE LIONS</p>
<p>手套与狮子</p>
<p>James Henry Leigh Hunt, 1784-1859. Leigh Hunt, as he is commonly
called, was prominent before the public for fifty years as “a writer of
essays, poems, plays, novels, and criticisms.” He was born at Southgate,
Middlesex, England. His mother was an American lady. He began to write
for the public at a very early age. In 1808, In connection with his
brother, he established “The Examiner,” a newspaper advocating liberal
opinions in politics. For certain articles offensive to the government,
the brothers were fined 500 Pounds each and condemned to two years’
imprisonment. Leigh fitted up his prison like a boudoir, received his
friends here, and wrote several works during his confinement. Mr. Hunt
was intimate with Byron, Shelley, Moore, and Keats, and was associated
with Byron and Shelley in the publication of a political and literary
journal. His last years were peacefully devoted to literature, and in
1847 he received a pension from the government.</p>
<p>King Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport,</p>
<p>And one day, as his lions fought, sat looking on the court;</p>
<p>The nobles filled the benches round, the ladies by their side,</p>
<p>And ’mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom he
sighed:</p>
<p>And truly ’t was a gallant thing to see that crowning show,</p>
<p>Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.</p>
<p>Ramped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;</p>
<p>They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their
paws;</p>
<p>With wallowing might and stifled roar, they rolled on one
another:</p>
<p>Till all the pit, with sand and mane, was in a thunderous
smother;</p>
<p>The bloody foam above the bars came whizzing through the air:</p>
<p>Said Francis, then, “Faith, gentlemen, we’re better here than
there.”</p>
<p>De Lorge’s love o’erheard the king,—a beauteous, lively dame,</p>
<p>With smiling lips, and sharp, bright eyes, which always seemed the
same;</p>
<p>She thought, “The Count, my lover, is brave as brave call be,</p>
<p>He surely would do wondrous things to show his love for me;</p>
<p>King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine;</p>
<p>I’ll drop my glove to prove his love; great glory will be mine.”</p>
<p>She dropped her glove to prove his love, then looked at him and
smiled;</p>
<p>He bowed, and in a moment leaped among the lions wild;</p>
<p>The leap was quick, return was quick, he soon regained his place,</p>
<p>Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady’s
face.</p>
<p>“In faith,” cried Francis, “rightly done!” and he rose from where he
sat;</p>
<p>“No love,” quoth he, “but vanity, sets love a task like that.”</p>

<p>Iago . Marry, heaven forbid!</p>
<p>Cas . Reputation, reputation, reputation! Oh, I have lost my
reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is
bestial. My reputation! Iago, my reputation!</p>
<p>Iago . As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily
wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an
idle and most false imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute
yourself such a loser. What, man! there are ways to recover the general
again. Sue to him again, and he’s yours.</p>
<p>Cas . I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a
commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer.
Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou
hast no name to be known by, let us call thee devil!</p>
<p>Iago . What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he
done to you?</p>
<p>Cas . I know not.</p>
<p>Iago . Is’t possible?</p>
<p>Cas . I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel,
but nothing wherefore. Oh that men should put an enemy in their mouths
to steal away their brains! that we should, with joy, revel, pleasure,
and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!</p>
<p>Iago . Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
recovered?</p>
<p>Cas . It hath pleased the devil, Drunkenness, to give place to the
devil, Wrath; one unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly
despise myself.</p>
<p>Iago . Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place,
and the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this had
not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.</p>
<p>Cas . I will ask him for my place again: he shall tell me I am a
drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them
all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast!
Oh strange!—Every inordinate cup is unblessed, and the ingredient is a
devil!</p>
<p>Iago . Come, come; good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be
well used; exclaim no more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you
think I love you.</p>
<p>Cas . I have well approved it, sir,—I, drunk!</p>
<p>Iago . You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man. I’ll tell
you what you shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general. Confess
yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place
again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she
holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested.
This broken joint between you and her husband, entreat her to splinter;
and, my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love
shall grow stronger than it was before.</p>
<p>Cas . You advise me well.</p>
<p>Iago . I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.</p>
<p>Cas . I think it freely, and betimes in the morning, I will beseech
the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me; I am desperate of my
fortunes if they check me here.</p>
<p>Iago . You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the
watch.</p>
<p>Cas . Good night, honest Iago.</p>

<p>伊阿古 什么！副将，你受伤了吗？</p>
<p>凯西奥 嗯，我的伤是无药可救的了。</p>
<p>伊阿古 哎哟，上天保佑没有这样的事！</p>
<p>凯西奥
名誉，名誉，名誉！啊，我的名誉已经一败涂地了！我已经失去我的生命中不死的一部分，留下来的也就跟畜生没有分别了。我的名誉，伊阿古，我的名誉！</p>
<p>伊阿古
我是个老实人，我还以为你受到了什么身体上的伤害，那是比名誉的损失痛苦得多的。名誉是一件无聊的骗人的东西！得到它的人未必有什么功德，失去它的人也未必有什么过失。你的名誉仍旧是好端端的，除非你自以为它已经扫地了。嘿，朋友，你要恢复主帅对你的欢心，尽有办法呢。你现在不过一时遭逢他的恼怒；他给你的这一种处分，与其说是表示对你的不满，还不如说是遮掩世人耳目的政策，正像有人为了吓退一头凶恶的狮子而故意鞭打他的驯良的狗一样。你只要向他恳求恳求，他一定会回心转意的。</p>
<p>凯西奥
我宁愿恳求他唾弃我，也不愿蒙蔽他的聪明，让这样一位贤能的主帅手下有这么一个酗酒放荡的不肖将校。纵饮无度！胡言乱道！吵架！吹牛！赌咒！跟自己的影子说些废话！啊，你这空虚缥缈的酒的精灵，要是你还没有一个名字，让我们叫你作魔鬼吧！</p>
<p>伊阿古 你提着剑追逐不舍的那个人是谁？他怎么冒犯了你？</p>
<p>凯西奥 我不知道。</p>
<p>伊阿古 你怎么会不知道？</p>
<p>凯西奥
我记得一大堆的事情，可是全都是模模糊糊的；我记得跟人家吵起来，可是不知道为了什么。上帝啊！人们居然会把一个仇敌放进自己的嘴里，让它偷去他们的头脑！我们居然会在欢天喜地之中，把自己变成了畜生！</p>
<p>伊阿古 可是你现在已经很清醒了；你怎么会明白过来的？</p>
<p>凯西奥
气鬼一上了身，酒鬼就自动退让；一件过失引起了第二件过失，简直使我自己也瞧不起自己了。</p>
<p>伊阿古
得啦，你也太认真了。照此时此地的环境说起来，我但愿没有这种事情发生；可是既然事已如此，替自己谋算个好办法吧。</p>
<p>凯西奥
我要向他请求恢复我的原职；他会对我说我是一个酒棍！即使我有一百张嘴，这样一个答复也会把它们一起封住。现在还是一个清清楚楚的人，不一会儿就变成个傻子，然后立刻就变成一头畜生！啊，奇怪！每一杯过量的酒都是魔鬼酿成的毒汁。</p>
<p>伊阿古
算了，算了，好酒只要不滥喝，也是一个很好的伙伴；你也不用咒骂它了。副将，我想你一定把我当作一个好朋友看待。</p>
<p>凯西奥 我很信任你的友谊。我醉了！</p>
<p>伊阿古
朋友，一个人有时候多喝了几杯，也是免不了的。让我告诉你一个办法。我们主帅的夫人现在是我们真正的主帅；我可以这样说，因为他心里只念着她的好处，眼睛里只看见她的可爱。你只要在她面前坦白忏悔，恳求恳求她，她一定会帮助你官复原职。她的性情是那么慷慨仁慈，那么体贴人心，人家请她出十分力，她要是没有出到十二分，就觉得好像对不起人似的。你请她替你弥缝弥缝你跟她的丈夫之间的这一道裂痕，我可以拿我的全部财产打赌，你们的交情一定反而会因此格外加强的。</p>
<p>凯西奥 你的主意出得很好。</p>
<p>伊阿古 我发誓这一种意思完全出于一片诚心。</p>
<p>凯西奥
我充分信任你的善意；明天一早我就请求贤德的苔丝狄蒙娜替我尽力说情。要是我在这儿给他们革退了，我的前途也就从此毁了。</p>
<p>伊阿古 你说得对。晚安，副将；我还要守夜去呢。</p>
<p>凯西奥 晚安，正直的伊阿古！</p>

<p>STARVED ROCK</p>
<p>饥饿岩</p>
<p>Francis Parkman, 1823-1893, the son of a clergyman of the same name,
was born in Boston, and graduated at Harvard University in 1844. He
spent more than twenty years in a careful study of the early French
explorations and settlements in America; and he published the fruits of
his labor in twelve large volumes. Although troubled with an affection
of the eyes, which sometimes wholly prevented reading or writing, his
work was most carefully and successfully done. His narratives are
written in a clear and animated style, and his volumes are a rich
contribution to American history.</p>
<p>The cliff called “Starved Rock,” now pointed out to travelers as the
chief natural curiosity of the region, rises, steep on three sides as a
castle wall, to the height of a hundred and twenty-five feet above the
river. In front, it overhangs the water that washes its base; its
western brow looks down on the tops of the forest trees below; and on
the east lies a wide gorge, or ravine, choked with the mingled foliage
of oaks, walnuts, and elms; while in its rocky depths a little brook
creeps down to mingle with the river.</p>
<p>From the rugged trunk of the stunted cedar that leans forward from
the brink, you may drop a plummet into the river below, where the
catfish and the turtles may plainly be seen gliding over the wrinkled
sands of the clear and shallow current. The cliff is accessible only
from the south, where a man may climb up, not without difficulty, by a
steep and narrow passage. The top is about an acre in extent.</p>
<p>Here, in the month of December, 1682, La Salle and Tonty began to
entrench themselves. They cut away the forest that crowned the rock,
built storehouses and dwellings of its remains, dragged timber up the
rugged pathway, and encircled the summit with a palisade. Thus the
winter was passed, and meanwhile the work of negotiation went
prosperously on. The minds of the Indians had been already prepared. In
La Salle they saw their champion against the Iroquois, the standing
terror of all this region. They gathered around his stronghold like the
timorous peasantry of the Middle Ages around the rock-built castle of
their feudal lord.</p>
<p>From the wooden ramparts of St. Louis,—for so he named his fort,—high
and inaccessible as an eagle’s nest, a strange scene lay before his eye.
The broad, flat valley of the Illinois was spread beneath him like a
map, bounded in the distance by its low wall of wooded hills. The river
wound at his feet in devious channels among islands bordered with lofty
trees; then, far on the left, flowed calmly westward through the vast
meadows, till its glimmering blue ribbon was lost in hazy distance.</p>
<p>There had been a time, and that not remote, when these fair meadows
were a waste of death and desolation, scathed with fire, and strewn with
the ghastly relics of an Iroquois victory. Now, all was changed. La
Salle looked down from his rock on a concourse of wild human life.
Lodges of bark and rushes, or cabins of logs, were clustered on the open
plain, or along the edges of the bordering forests. Squaws labored,
warriors lounged in the sun, naked children whooped and gamboled on the
grass.</p>
<p>Beyond the river, a mile and a half on the left, the banks were
studded once more with the lodges of the Illinois, who, to the number of
six thousand, had returned, since their defeat, to this their favorite
dwelling place. Scattered along the valley, among the adjacent hills, or
over the neighboring prairie, were the cantonments of a half score of
other tribes, and fragments of tribes, gathered under the protecting
aegis of the French.</p>

<p>这一方横空外凸的岩壁叫作“饥饿岩”，在旅人的眼里它无疑就是大自然的鬼斧神工；它三面陡峭，如同城堡的护墙，凌空悬于距离河面一百二十五英尺的上空。岩石的正面如一角骑楼垂悬于河流之上，河水日复一日地冲刷着底下的基石；它的西侧俯瞰着身下郁郁葱葱的森林；东面静卧着一弯宽广的峡谷，抑或是山涧，其间缀满了橡树，胡桃和榆木的叶子；而在岩石深处的缝隙竟流出了一条潺潺的小溪，它顺着岩壁蜿蜒而下，最后汇入了下方的伊利诺伊河。</p>
<p>峭壁的顶端探出一棵矮小的雪松，攀在它粗糙的树干上，你可以朝底下的河流抛下一条系着铅坠的鱼线，也许你能清晰地看到，在荡漾着涟漪的沙石河床和清波浅流间正徜徉着鲶鱼和乌龟。只有沿着南侧一条陡峭逼仄的通道才能勉强攀上岩石，其顶部约有一英亩见方。</p>
<p>1682年的12月，就在这里，拉萨尔和冬迪开始安营扎寨。他们把覆盖山头的树木砍伐干净，在那儿盖起了仓舍库房安放那些树木，从那条崎岖不平的通道上拉来了木料，在山头围起了栅栏。冬天过去了，与此同时，谈判也有条不紊地进行着。印第安人已打定了主意。他们在拉萨尔身上看到了打败地方恶霸易洛魁人的希望。他们聚在拉萨尔的大本营外，就像是中世纪胆小怕事的农户聚在他们封建领主的石头城堡外一样。</p>
<p>拉萨尔把这里命名为圣路易斯要塞，从鹰巢一般高耸入云、难以攀越的木质壁垒放眼望去，一片奇特的景象尽收眼底。伊利诺伊河广袤平坦的流域像一幅巨大的地图徐徐展开，河流的远处青山环抱。脚下的河流蜿蜒而行，若干支流旁逸而出，由此形成的汀州上长满了参天大树；再往更远处看，在拉萨尔的左侧，河流继续向西前行，河水平缓地流经一望无际的大草原，直至那条闪烁着幽光的蓝色缎带消失在薄暮霭霭的远方。</p>
<p>就在不久之前，这片美丽的草原曾在易洛魁人的战火蹂躏下一度满目疮痍，一片死寂。幸好，一切都变了。站在岩石顶上，拉萨尔俯视着原住民们聚族而居，一派暖暖的烟火气息。开阔地带或是树林边上，簇拥着树皮装饰的棚屋和原木搭建的村舍。妇女们辛勤劳作着，休养生息的战士们慵懒地躺着晒太阳，光着膀子的孩子们欢呼雀跃地在草地上奔跑嬉戏。</p>
<p>在河流左岸一英里半以外的山坡上再度出现了零星的山林小屋，那是六千个伊利诺伊印第安人的家，自从战败后，他们就回到了魂牵梦系的家园。在流域途经的山腹地区和大草原上，星星点点地驻扎着十几个其他部落，还有一些族群的残部，他们在法国人的庇护之下群居于此。</p>

<p>PRINCE HENRY AND FALSTAFF</p>
<p>亨利亲王和福斯塔夫</p>
<p>PRINCE HENRY and POINS, in a back room, in a tavern. Enter FALSTAFF,
GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO.</p>
<p>Poins . Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been?</p>
<p>Falstaff . A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I lead this life long,
I’ll sew nether stocks, and mend them, and foot them, too. A plague of
all cowards! Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?
(He drinks, and then continues.) You rogue, here’s lime in this sack,
too; there is nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man: yet a
coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it. A villainous coward!
Go thy ways, old Jack; die when thou wilt: if manhood, good manhood, be
not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a shotten herring.
There live not three good men unhanged, in England; and one of them is
fat and grows old; a bad world, I say! I would I were a weaver; I could
sing psalms, or anything. A plague of all cowards, I say still.</p>
<p>Prince Henry . How now, woolsack? What mutter you?</p>
<p>Fal . A king’s son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a
dagger of lath, and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of
wild geese, I’ll never wear hair on my face more. You, Prince of
Wales!</p>
<p>P. Henry . Why, you baseborn dog! What’s the matter?</p>
<p>Fal . Are you not a coward? Answer me to that; and Poins there?</p>
<p>Poins . Ye fat braggart, an ye call me coward, I’ll stab thee.</p>
<p>Fal . I call thee coward? I’ll see thee gibbeted ere I call thee
coward: but I would give a thousand pounds I could run as fast as thou
canst. You are straight enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees
your back: call you that backing of your friends? A plague upon such
backing! Give me them that will face me. Give me a cup of sack. I am a
rogue, if I have drunk to-day.</p>
<p>P. Henry . O villain! thy lips ate scarce wiped since thou drunkest
last.</p>
<p>Fal . All’s one for that. A plague of all cowards, still say 1. (He
drinks.)</p>
<p>P. Henry . What’s the matter?</p>
<p>Fal . What’s the matter! There be four of us here have ta’en a
thousand pounds this morning.</p>
<p>P. Henry . Where is it, Jack? where is it?</p>
<p>Fal . Where is it? Taken from us it is; a hundred upon poor four of
us.</p>
<p>P. Henry . What! a hundred, man?</p>
<p>Fal . I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them
two hours together. I have ’scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust
through the doublet; four, through the hose; my buckler cut through and
through; my sword hacked like a handsaw; look here! (shows his sword .)
I never dealt better since I was a man; all would not do. A plague of
all cowards! Let them speak (pointing to GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO);
if they speak more or less than truth, they are villains and the sons of
darkness.</p>
<p>P. Henry . Speak, sirs; how was it?</p>
<p>Gadshill . We four set upon some dozen—</p>
<p>Fal . Sixteen, at least, my lord.</p>
<p>Gad . And bound them.</p>
<p>Peta . No, no, they were not bound.</p>
<p>Fal . You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am a Jew,
else—an Ebrew Jew.</p>
<p>Gad . As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon
us—</p>
<p>Fal . And unbound the rest; and then come in the other.</p>
<p>P. Henry . What! fought ye with them all?</p>
<p>Fal . All? I know not what ye call all; but if I fought not with
fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if there were not two or three
and fifty upon poor old Jack, then I am no two-legged creature.</p>
<p>P. Henry . Pray heaven, you have not murdered some of them.</p>
<p>Fal . Nay, that’s past praying for; for I have peppered two of them;
two I am sure I have paid; two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee
what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, and call me a horse.
Thou knowest my old ward; (he draws his sword and stands if about to
fight) here I lay, and thus I bore my point. Four rogues in buckram let
drive at me—</p>
<p>P. Henry . What! four? Thou saidst but two even now.</p>
<p>Fal . Four, Hal; I told thee four.</p>
<p>Poins . Ay, ay, he said four.</p>
<p>Fal . These four came all afront, and mainly thrust at me. I made no
more ado, but took all their seven points in my target, thus.</p>
<p>P. Henry . Seven? Why, there were but four, even now.</p>
<p>Fal . In buckram?</p>
<p>Poins . Ay, four, in buckram suits.</p>
<p>Fal . Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.</p>
<p>P. Henry . Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.</p>
<p>Fal . Dost thou hear me, Hal?</p>
<p>P. Henry . Ay, and mark thee, too, Jack.</p>
<p>Fal . Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine in buckram,
that I told thee of—</p>
<p>P. Henry . So, two more already.</p>
<p>Fal . Their points being broken, began to give me ground; but I
followed me close, came in foot and hand; and, with a thought, seven of
the eleven I paid.</p>
<p>P. Henry . O, monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!</p>
<p>Fal . But three knaves, in Kendal green, came at my back, and let
drive at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy
hand.</p>
<p>P. Henry . These lies are like the father of them; gross as a
mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained, nott-pated fool; thou
greasy tallow keech—</p>
<p>Fal . What! Art thou mad! Art thou mad? Is not the truth the
truth?</p>
<p>P. Henry . Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green, when
it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? Come, tell us your reason;
what sayest thou to this?</p>
<p>Poins . Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.</p>
<p>Fal . What, upon compulsion? No, were I at the strappado, or all the
racks in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a
reason on compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I
would give no man a reason on compulsion, I.</p>
<p>P. Henry . I’ll be no longer guilty of this sin: this sanguine
coward, this</p>
<p>horseback breaker, this huge hill of flesh—</p>
<p>Fal . Away! you starveling, you eel skin, you dried neat’s tongue,
you stockfish! Oh for breath to utter what is like thee!—you tailor’s
yard, you sheath, you bow case, you—</p>
<p>P. Henry . Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again; and when thou
hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak but this.</p>
<p>Poins . Mark, Jack.</p>
<p>P. Henry . We two saw you four set on four; you bound them, and were
masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down.
Then did we two set on you four, and with a word outfaced you from your
prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in the house.—And,
Falstaff, you carried yourself away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity,
and roared for mercy, and still ran and roared, as ever I heard a calf.
What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say
it was in fight! What trick, what device, what starting hole, canst thou
now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame?</p>
<p>Poins . Come, let’s hear, Jack. What trick hast thou now?</p>
<p>Fal . Why, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why, bear ye, my
masters: was it for me to kill the heir apparent? Should I turn upon the
true prince? Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules; but beware
instinct; the lion will not touch the true prince; instinct is a great
matter; I was a coward on instinct. I shall think the better of myself
and thee during my life; I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true
prince. But, lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap to the
doors. Watch to-night, pray to-morrow. Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of
gold; all the titles of good-fellowship come to you! What! shall we be
merry? Shall we have a play extempore?</p>
<p>P. Henry . Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.</p>
<p>Fal . Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!</p>

<p>亨利四世和波因斯在酒馆后室。福斯塔夫、盖兹希尔、巴道夫及皮多上。</p>
<p>波因斯 欢迎，杰克。你这是打哪儿来？</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
全是一帮孬种，哎呦喂，比孬种还要没胆！嘿，这么说一点都不为过！伙计，给我来杯酒。日子要是像这样过下去，我就得自个儿缝袜，自个儿补袜，自个儿上袜底呢。没胆的孬种！快给我倒杯酒来，混蛋！——这世上的男子汉难道都死绝了吗？（他喝了口酒，继续说道。）该死的，这酒里也兑着酸橙汁；谁还能指望坏蛋干出什么好事不成；可一个孬种比一杯兑了酸橙汁的酒更恶心，坏透了的孬种！随你的便吧，老杰克；你想啥时候死，那就去赴黄泉吧。要是这世上还有什么男子汉大丈夫，有什么顶天立地的好男儿的话，那就让老子我变成一个没用的窝囊废。有种的老爷们都上了绞刑架，还活着的在英格兰总共不过三个，其中的一个已经发了胖，一天老似一天。老天开眼，救救这个万恶的世界吧！我希望自己是个纺织工；我可以唱唱圣诗，或是其他啥的。该死的孬种！我还是这话。</p>
<p>亨利四世 怎么了，卷毛？你叽里咕噜说些什么呀？</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
国王的儿子！要是我不手持利剑把你打出这片疆土，像赶野鹅一样把你的臣民一起驱逐出境，我就枉为一堂堂须眉男子汉。你还是这威尔士的亲王吧！</p>
<p>亲王 怎么了，你这下贱坯子！到底怎么一回事？</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 难道你不是一个孬种？回答我的问题；还有那边的波因斯？</p>
<p>波因斯 你这头肥猪，敢骂我是孬种，小心我戳死你。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
我就骂你了，孬种！在骂你孬种前，我得先亲眼看着你下地狱；我要是逃跑的时候跑得跟你一样快，那我情愿掏出1,000镑。你的肩背可够挺拔的，你也不怕人家看见你的背：你就把这叫作没有背信弃义？算了吧，别说的比唱的好听了！那些愿意和我面对面的人，才是我的朋友。给我来杯酒。今天老子要是喝趴下了，我就是个混蛋。</p>
<p>亲王 哎哟，你这恶棍，自打上次喝趴下，你嘴巴还没擦干净呢。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 那又怎么样？反正你们全是孬种，我可不改口。（饮酒）</p>
<p>亲王 怎么回事？</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 怎么回事！我们四个在今天早上抢了一千英镑。</p>
<p>亲王 哪儿呢，杰克？钱在哪儿呢？</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 在哪儿！又被人给抢走了；一百号人对我们四个，可怜呐。</p>
<p>亲王 什么？你是说一百个？</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
要是我没有以一对一打跟他们短兵相接足足斗了两个小时，我就是个混蛋。能活着逃命，简直就是奇迹。我身上的背心被捅了八个窟窿，袜腿上四个；盾牌上的洞比盾牌还大；刀刃都给砍豁了边；看看这儿！（他给众人看他的刀。）自打我成年后，我就没这么和人苦战过；可惜寡不敌众啊。一帮孬种！让他们自己说（指指盖兹希尔、巴道夫和皮多）；他们谁要敢避重就轻，那就是狗娘养的混蛋。</p>
<p>亲王 说吧，诸位，说说是怎么回事？</p>
<p>盖兹希尔 我们四个对付一群人——</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 十六个，至少十六个。</p>
<p>盖兹希尔 然后把他们绑了起来。</p>
<p>皮多 没，没有，他们没有被绑。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
你个混蛋，他们被绑了，每一个都被咱们绑起来了；要是没有，那我就是个犹太人，如假包换的希伯来犹太人。</p>
<p>盖兹希尔
就在我们分钱的时候，对方来了六七个援兵把我们打了个措手不及——</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 接着给绑了手脚的人卸了绑；松了绑的从另一边攻打我们。</p>
<p>亲王 什么？你是说你们四个打他们全部？</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
全部！我不知道你说的全部指的是什么；但如果我没有一个打他们五十个，那我就是一捆小萝卜；如果对方不是五十二三个对付可怜的老杰克，那我就不是两条腿的玩意。</p>
<p>亲王 祈祷吧，但愿你没要了他们中几个人的命。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
太迟了；我已经要了其中两个的命；我确信亲手结果了两个；两个穿着粗麻衣衫的家伙。听着，哈尔，如果我撒谎，你就啐我的脸，骂我是匹马。你是知道我惯用的防御姿态的；（他拔出刀，摆出进攻的架势）我就这样稳住步子，手里就这样握着我的刀。四个穿着粗麻布衣的家伙向我扑过来——</p>
<p>亲王 什么！四个？刚才不是说两个的嘛。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 四个，哈尔；我跟你说是四个。</p>
<p>波因斯 是的，没错，他是说四个来着。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
四个家伙一齐朝我扑过来，个个都举着刀朝我猛刺。我不费吹灰之力就拿起盾把七把刀给顶住了。</p>
<p>亲王 七个？咦，刚才还说四个的嘛。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 穿粗麻布衣服的。</p>
<p>波因斯 对，四个，四个穿粗麻布衣服。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 是七个，我以手中的刀起誓，否则我就是个混蛋。</p>
<p>亲王 随他去；待会儿还得往上加。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 哈尔，你有没有听我说？</p>
<p>亲王 当然，认真听着哪，杰克。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
那就好，这么精彩可不容错过。刚才我说到那九个穿着粗麻布衣服的家伙——</p>
<p>亲王 我说什么来着，又多了两个。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
他们的刀尖都折了，然后开始往后撤退；但我紧咬着不放，手脚并用；眨眼工夫把十一个人里的七个给结果了。</p>
<p>亲王 哦，太荒谬了！两个穿粗麻布衣的一下子变成了十一个！</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
但这时三个穿着肯德尔绿色粗呢的无赖从我背后冒出来，拿着刀就朝我刺；哈尔，你要知道，当时天黑得伸手不见五指。</p>
<p>亲王
当真是什么样的人撒什么样的谎；瞧这牛吹得就跟眼前杵着座山那么明白。哎呀，你这个蠢头蠢脑的榆木疙瘩，猪油蒙了心的东西——</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 什么！疯了吧你？疯了吧你？难道我说的不是事实？</p>
<p>亲王
嗯，既然天黑得伸手不见五指，你是怎么晓得他们穿着肯德尔绿色粗呢？来，告诉我理由，你怎么解释？</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
你们这是干什么，逼供呀？没门，就算把我送上绞刑架，或是把我五马分尸，我都不会屈打成招。逼我给你们理由！就算理由像黑莓一样俯首皆是，我也不会被人逼着说出一条来，决不。</p>
<p>亲王
你活该被人嘲笑轻贱：你这个满面红光的懦夫，能把马背压断的胖子，白长了一身膘的肥猪——</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
走开！你这个饿死鬼，鳗鱼皮，干牛舌，鱼干片！让我喘口气再来说道说道你像个啥玩意！——你是裁缝用的量衣尺，你是放刀用的刀鞘，你是装弓箭用的袋子，你是——</p>
<p>亲王
行了，喘口气再接着说；把你肚子里的下流比喻全倒出来，然后听我说，就一点。</p>
<p>波因斯 听好了，杰克。</p>
<p>亲王
我们两个看见你们四打四；你们把对方给捆了，抢了他们财物。听着，一个这么简单的故事就能把你驳得哑口无言。然后我们两个攻击了你们四个，一句话就把你们吓得屁滚尿流，你们所得的赃物自然落在我们手中，就放在这间屋子里，现在就可以拿给你们看。——而且，福斯塔夫，你撒腿逃跑的时候那叫一个快啊，而且还一点不耽误你满嘴讨饶，我可从没看见哪头牛犊像你这样边跑边叫，动作还那么灵活迅速。你这个奴才当真是举世无双，把刀使成这副模样，还有脸说是打仗打的！我倒要听听你还有什么奇方妙招，还能想出什么样的遁词能让你逃脱眼前这场板上钉钉的奇耻大辱？</p>
<p>波因斯 说吧，杰克，我们洗耳恭听。听听你还能耍什么把戏？</p>
<p>福斯塔夫
哎呀，我早知道是你，就像上帝也心知肚明一样。哎呀，诸位，都听我说：我怎么可能害死我们的储君呢？我会和一位亲王对着干吗？哎呀，你们都知道我和赫拉克拉斯一样英勇善战；可人心都是肉长的；就算一头狮子也不会加害亲王；何况是人；就算我是一个孬种那也是因为我心太软的缘故。这辈子我为此感到骄傲，对你，我也无愧于心。我就像一头勇猛的狮子，而你就是一位货真价实的王储。好了，伙计们，我很高兴大家发了笔财。老板娘，关上门。今晚好好值夜，明天好好祷告。好汉们，伙计们，兄弟们，好人们，你们担得起所有至亲好友的称呼！怎么样！咱们好好乐一乐？要不即兴排出戏吧？</p>
<p>亲王 好主意；剧情就是你逃之夭夭。</p>
<p>福斯塔夫 啊呀，哈尔，如果你爱我，就别哪壶不开提哪壶了。</p>

<p>STUDIES</p>
<p>论读书</p>
<p>Sir Francis Bacon, 1561-1626. This eminent man was the youngest son
of Sir Nicholas Bacon, lord keeper of the seal in the early part of
Elizabeth’s reign, and Anne Bacon, one of the most learned women of the
time, daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke. He was born in London, and educated
at Cambridge. He was a laborious and successful student, but even in his
boyhood conceived a great distrust of the methods of study pursued at
the seats of learning,—methods which he exerted his great powers to
correct in his maturer years. Much of his life was spent in the practice
of law, in the discharge of the duties of high office, and as a member
of Parliament; but, to the end of life, he busied himself with
philosophical pursuits, and he will be known to posterity chiefly for
his deep and clear writings on these subjects. His constant direction in
philosophy is to break away from assumption and tradition, and to be led
only by sound induction based on a knowledge of observed phenomena. His
“Novum Organum” and “Advancement of Learning” embody his ideas on
philosophy and the true methods of seeking knowledge.</p>
<p>Bacon rose to no very great distinction during the reign of
Elizabeth; but, under James I, he was promoted to positions of great
honor and influence. In 1618 he was made Baron of Verulam; and, three
years later, he was made Viscount of St. Albans. During much of his
life, Bacon was in pecuniary straits, which was doubtless one reason of
his downfall; for, in 1621, he was accused of taking bribes, a charge to
which he pleaded guilty. His disgrace followed, and he passed the last
years of his life in retirement. Among the distinguished names in
English literature, none stands higher in his department than that of
Francis Bacon.</p>
<p>Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief
use for delight is in privateness, and retiring; for ornament, is in
discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and disposition of
business; for expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of the
particulars, one by one; but the general counsels, and the plots and
marshaling of affairs, come best from those that are learned.</p>
<p>To spend too much time in studies, is sloth; to use them too much for
ornament, is affectation; to make judgment wholly by their rules, is the
humor of a scholar; they perfect nature and are perfected by experience—
for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning by
study; and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at
large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty men contemn
studies, simple men admire them, and wise men use them, for they teach
not their own use; but that is a wisdom without them, and above them,
won by observation.</p>
<p>Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for
granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. Some
books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be
chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts;
others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly,
and with diligence and attention. Some books also may he read by deputy,
and extracts made of them by others; but that would be only in the less
important arguments, and the meaner sort of books; else distilled books
are like common distilled waters, flashy things.</p>
<p>Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an
exact man; and, therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a
great memory; if he confer little, he had need have a present wit; and
if he read little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know that
he doth not. Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics,
subtle; natural philosophy, deep; moral philosophy, grave; logic and
rhetoric, able to contend.</p>

<p>读书可以作为消遣，可以作为装饰，也可以增长才干。孤独寂寞时，阅读可以消遣。高谈阔论时，知识可供装饰。处世行事时，知识意味着才干。懂得事物因果的人是幸运的。有实际经验的人虽能够处理个别性的事务，但若要综观整体，运筹全局，却唯有学识方能办到。</p>
<p>读书太慢的人弛惰，为装潢而读书是欺人，完全按照书本做事就是呆子。</p>
<p>求知可以改进人性，而经验又可以改进知识本身。人的天性犹如野生的花草，求知学习好比修剪移栽。学问虽能指引方向，但往往流于浅泛，必须依靠经验才能扎下根基。狡诈者轻鄙学问，愚鲁者羡慕学问，聪明者则运用学问。知识本身并没有告诉人怎样运用它，运用的智慧在于书本之外。这是技艺，不体验就学不到。</p>
<p>读书的目的是认识事物原理。为挑剔辩驳去读书是无聊的。但也不可过于迷信书本。求知的目的不是为了吹嘘炫耀，而应该是为了寻找真理，启迪智慧。</p>
<p>书籍好比食品。有些只须浅尝，有些可以吞咽，只有少数需要仔细咀嚼，慢慢品味。所以，有的书只要读其中一部分，有的书只须知其梗概，而对于少数好书，则应当通读，细读，反复读。有的书可以请人代读，然后看他的笔记摘要就行了。但这只应限于不太重要的议论和质量粗劣的书。否则一本书就像已被蒸馏过的水，变得淡而无味了。</p>
<p>读书使人充实，讨论使人机敏，写作则能使人精确。因此，如果有人不读书又想冒充博学多知，他就必须很狡黠，才能掩人耳目。如果一个人懒于动笔，他的记忆力就必须强而可靠。如果一个人要孤独探索，他的头脑就必须格外敏锐。</p>
<p>读史使人明智，读诗使人聪慧，学习数学使人精密，物理学使人深刻，伦理学使人高尚，逻辑修辞使人善辩。</p>

<p>SURRENDER OF GRANADA</p>
<p>格拉纳达之降</p>
<p>Sir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, 1806-1873, was born in Norfolk
County, England. His father died when he was young; his mother was a
woman of strong literary tastes, and did much to form her son’s mind. In
1844, by royal license, he took the surname of Lytton from his mother’s
family. Bulwer graduated at Cambridge. He began to publish in 1826, and
his novels and plays followed rapidly. “Pelham,” “The Caxtons,” “My
Novel,” “What will he do with it?” and “Kenelm Chillingly” are among the
best known of his numerous novels; and “The Lady of Lyons” and
“Richelieu” are his most successful plays. His novels are extensively
read on the continent, and have been translated into most of the
languages spoken there. “Leila, or the Siege of Granada,” from which
this selection is adapted, was published in 1840.</p>
<p>Day dawned upon Granada, and the beams of the winter sun, smiling
away the clouds of the past night, played cheerily on the murmuring
waves of the Xenil and the Darro. Alone, upon a balcony commanding a
view of the beautiful landscape, stood Boabdil, the last of the Moorish
kings. He had sought to bring to his aid all the lessons of the
philosophy he had cultivated.</p>
<p>“What are we,” thought the musing prince, “that we should fill the
world with ourselves—we kings? Earth resounds with the crash of my
falling throne; on the ear of races unborn the echo will live prolonged.
But what have I lost? Nothing that was necessary to my happiness, my
repose: nothing save the source of all my wretchedness, the Marah of my
life! Shall I less enjoy heaven and earth, or thought or action, or
man’s more material luxuries of food or sleep—the common and the cheap
desires of all? Arouse thee, then, O heart within me! Many and deep
emotions of sorrow or of joy are yet left to break the monotony of
existence… But it is time to depart.” So saying, he descended to the
court, flung himself on his barb, and, with a small and saddened train,
passed through the gate which we yet survey, by a blackened and
crumbling tower, overgrown with vines and ivy; thence, amidst gardens
now appertaining to the convent of the victor faith, he took his
mournful and unwitnessed way.</p>
<p>When he came to the middle of the hill that rises above those
gardens, the steel of the Spanish armor gleamed upon him, as the
detachment sent to occupy the palace marched over the summit in steady
order and profound silence. At the head of this vanguard, rode, upon a
snow-white palfrey, the Bishop of Avila, followed by a long train of
barefooted monks. They halted as Boabdil approached, and the grave
bishop saluted him with the air of one who addresses an infidel and
inferior. With the quick sense of dignity common to the great, and yet
more to the fallen, Boabdil felt, but resented not, the pride of the
ecclesiastic. “Go, Christian,” said he, mildly, “the gates of the
Alhambra are open, and Allah has bestowed the palace and the city upon
your king; may his virtues atone the faults of Boabdil!” So saying, and
waiting no answer, he rode on without looking to the right or the left.
The Spaniards also pursued their way.</p>
<p>The sun had fairly risen above the mountains, when Boabdil and his
train beheld, from the eminence on which they were, the whole armament
of Spain; and at the same moment, louder than the tramp of horse or the
clash of arms, was heard distinctly the solemn chant of Te Deum, which
preceded the blaze of the unfurled and lofty standards. Boabdil, himself
still silent, heard the groans and exclamations of his train; he turned
to cheer or chide them, and then saw, from his own watchtower, with the
sun shining full upon its pure and dazzling surface, the silver cross of
Spain. His Alhambra was already in the hands of the foe; while beside
that badge of the holy war waved the gay and flaunting flag of St. Iago,
the canonized Mars of the chivalry of Spain. At that sight the King’s
voice died within him; he gave the rein to his barb, impatient to close
the fatal ceremonial, and did not slacken his speed till almost within
bowshot of the first ranks of the army.</p>
<p>Never had Christian war assumed a more splendid and imposing aspect.
Far as the eye could reach, extended the glittering and gorgeous lines
of that goodly power, bristling with sunlit spears and blazoned banners;
while beside, murmured, and glowed, and danced, the silver and laughing
Xenil, careless what lord should possess, for his little day, the banks
that bloomed by its everlasting course. By a small mosque halted the
flower of the army. Surrounded by the archpriests of that mighty
hierarchy, the peers and princes of a court that rivaled the Rolands of
Charlemagne, was seen the kingly form of Ferdinand himself, with Isabel
at his right hand, and the highborn dames of Spain, relieving, with
their gay colors and sparkling gems, the sterner splendor of the crested
helmet and polished mail. Within sight of the royal group, Boabdil
halted, composed his aspect so as best to conceal his soul, and, a
little in advance of his scanty train, but never in mien and majesty
more a king, the son of Abdallah met his haughty conqueror.</p>
<p>At the sight of his princely countenance and golden hair, his comely
and commanding beauty, made more touching by youth, a thrill of
compassionate admiration ran through that assembly of the brave and
fair. Ferdinand and Isabel slowly advanced to meet their late
rival,—their new subject; and, as Boabdil would have dismounted, the
Spanish king placed his hand upon his shoulder. “Brother and prince,”
said he, “forget thy sorrows; and may our friendship hereafter console
thee for reverses, against which thou hast contended as a hero and a
king—resisting man, but resigned at length to God.”</p>
<p>Boabdil did not affect to return this bitter but unintentional
mockery of compliment, He bowed his head, and remained a moment silent;
then motioning to his train, four of his officers approached, and,
kneeling beside Ferdinand, proffered to him, upon a silver buckler, the
keys of the city. “O king!” then said Boabdil, “accept the keys of the
last hold which has resisted the arms of Spain! The empire of the Moslem
is no more. Thine are the city and the people of Granada; yielding to
thy prowess, they yet confide in thy mercy.” “They do well,” said the
king; “our promises shall not be broken. But since we know the gallantry
of Moorish cavaliers, not to us, but to gentler hands, shall the keys of
Granada be surrendered.”</p>
<p>Thus saying, Ferdinand gave the keys to Isabel, who would have
addressed some soothing flatteries to Boabdil, but the emotion and
excitement were too much for her compassionate heart, heroine and queen
though she was; and when she lifted her eyes upon the calm and pale
features of the fallen monarch, the tears gushed from them irresistibly,
and her voice died in murmurs. A faint flush overspread the features of
Boabdil, and there was a momentary pause of embarrassment, which the
Moor was the first to break.</p>
<p>“Fair queen,” said he, with mournful and pathetic dignity, “thou
canst read the heart that thy generous sympathy touches and subdues;
this is thy last, nor least glorious conquest. But I detain ye; let not
my aspect cloud your triumph. Suffer me to say farewell.” “Farewell, my
brother,” replied Ferdinand, “and may fair fortune go with you! Forget
the past!” Boabdil smiled bitterly, saluted the royal pair with profound
and silent reverence, and rode slowly on, leaving the army below as he
ascended the path that led to his new principality beyond the
Alpuxarras. As the trees snatched the Moorish cavalcade from the view of
the king, Ferdinand ordered the army to recommence its march; and
trumpet and cymbal presently sent their music to the ear of the
Moslems.</p>
<p>Boabdil spurred on at full speed, till his panting charger halted at
the little village where his mother, his slaves, and his faithful wife,
Amine—sent on before—awaited him. Joining these, he proceeded without
delay upon his melancholy path. They ascended that eminence which is the
pass into the Alpuxarras. From its height, the vale, the rivers, the
spires, and the towers of Granada broke gloriously upon the view of the
little band. They halted mechanically and abruptly; every eye was turned
to the beloved scene. The proud shame of baffled warriors, the tender
memories of home, of childhood, of fatherland, swelled every heart, and
gushed from every eye.</p>
<p>Suddenly the distant boom of artillery broke from the citadel, and
rolled along the sunlit valley and crystal river. A universal wail burst
from the exiles; it smote,—it overpowered the heart of the ill-starred
king, in vain seeking to wrap himself in Eastern pride or stoical
philosophy. The tears gushed from his eyes, and he covered his face with
his hands. The band wound slowly on through the solitary defiles; and
that place where the king wept is still called The Last Sigh of the
Moor.</p>

<p>黎明在格拉纳达上空缓缓启开帷幕，冬阳微笑着拂开昨夜残云，在克塞尼尔河潋滟的流波里戏耍，在达若河荡漾的涟漪上跳跃。摩尔人的末代帝王——布阿卜迪勒，正独立阳台，极目远望破晓十分的迷人景色。他绞尽脑汁，在平生积累的哲学经验里搜寻着启开心智之门的灵钥。</p>
<p>“普天之下莫非王土——普天之下皆为我们所有，那我们到底算什么？”苦思冥想的帝王自问，“可是整个世界充斥着我的宝座砰啪碎裂声；一波波回音久久不息，仿佛在我耳朵上疾走。我失去了什么？那一切于我没什么大不了，既不能让我开怀一笑，也不能给我一夜安睡；而今没什么力量能堵住源源不竭的苦厄，我生命中的苦泉！世间万物我将不得欣赏，失去思想的快乐和行动的自由，珍馐美味吃不到，甚至安睡的权利——那些普通的不能再普通的愿望都变成了奢求？然而，我这颗心啊，你就醒醒！减轻生存枯燥单调的，还有许多深刻的忧伤、记忆里残留的欢乐……然而，是该走的时候了。”说着，他走下楼来到院子里，骑上他的非洲马，带着情绪低落的一小队随从，通过一道门——我们从墙皮脱落爬满葡萄藤，常春藤披靡的塔楼上能俯瞰到，自那里，在已属于天主教胜利者的花园中，继续往前走他那条愁惨而寥寂的路。</p>
<p>他来到了半山腰，那些花园已在他立脚的山下，被派遣来收复皇宫的西班牙分遣队井然有序，沉着肃静地朝顶峰行进，铁盔的光芒不断反射到他身上。阿维拉主教骑着一匹雪白温驯的马，领着长长一列赤足僧侣，走在先遣分队的前头，看到走近的布阿卜迪勒便收住马步，主教神色严肃，犹如面对一个没有信仰的下等人，一脸矜傲地向他打招呼。布阿卜迪勒像所有遭遇世界末日的王一样，感到尊严被欺，心生悲怆，但是他没怨恨主教，他知道那是天授神职的人所特有的矜持。“去吧，信徒们，”他语气温和，“阿尔罕布拉宫的大门为你们敞开着，真主已将皇宫和这座城市赐予你们年轻的国王；愿他的美德能弥补布阿卜迪勒犯下的过失！”</p>
<p>说完，他不等回答，直视前方骑上了马。而西班牙人也继续前行。</p>
<p>旭日已经跃上山巅，此时布阿卜迪勒与他的队伍站在高处，整个西班牙军队尽收眼底；同时隐隐传来马蹄声嘚嘚，刀剑声锵锵，不可一世的旗帜迎风招展，庄严的赞美颂诗回荡于山间，萦绕于旗帜的光辉之上。布阿卜迪勒寂然无语，耳听的随从们惊呼、抱怨。他转过身责备随从几句，让他们振奋精神，他的视线透过太阳那一轮灼亮晃眼的光线，看到那枚西班牙银光闪闪的十字架。他的阿尔罕布拉宫已经在敌人掌控之中了；而迎风飘展的圣·伊阿古旗帜上的圣战徽章，已加封到西班牙骑士战神圣徒之列。目睹此景，已为阶下囚的帝王失语了；他毫无耐性地结束这场锥心的观礼，放松缰绳，由着马蹄疾踏，直到离军队前列不到一箭之遥才想起吁住马步。</p>
<p>谁能想到基督徒战争竟呈现出如此辉煌壮观的形势。尽目力所及，那代表政权的队伍，犹如一条条亮闪闪、华灿灿的流水线蜿蜒前行，杆杆长矛上的日光闪耀，饰有纹章的面面旗帜猎猎有声，而一旁克塞尼尔河华丽眩目的银波在喃喃低语，欢腾跳跃，上帝何其冷漠，毫不顾惜一个落魄王者的情绪，让列列精兵占据连绵的河道讽刺般地在他眼前走过。这队精兵在一座小小的清真寺旁停下来。统治集团的大司祭们和堪与查理曼大帝的圣战士匹敌的王公大臣们，团团簇拥着一派帝王气势的斐南迪，他右边站着伊莎贝尔和西班牙贵族的名媛佳丽，她们一身绚丽色彩与珠光宝气，王公们头上翎羽钢盔的光辉以及身上擦得锃光发亮的盔甲，使严肃的气氛轻松了些。布阿卜迪勒看到这群王公大臣即刻站住，整肃神色，深藏灵魂，将一个国王的神采和威严收敛，从他那稀稀拉拉的队伍里迈出一步，于是默罕默德的儿子与他高傲的征服者迎面相逢。</p>
<p>然而一见他那隐藏不住的王者气度，那满头金发，那俊美威凛的仪容，使得年轻人大为感动，一阵发自内心的钦佩迅速传遍那一群勇敢公正的人。斐南迪与伊莎贝尔缓步迎接最后一个对手——他们的新子民；布阿卜迪勒下了马，西班牙国王伸手抚上他的肩头。“我的兄弟，我的王子，”年轻的国王说，“忘记你的悲伤吧；愿我们的友情能安慰你作为一个英雄、一个国王而奋战失败的痛苦——顽固抵抗者，最终还是得在上帝面前俯首听令的。”</p>
<p>布阿卜迪勒没有理会这种言不由衷、含讽带刺的致意，他低下头静默了片刻；然后对他的手下示意，于是走出来四个军官，齐齐跪在斐南迪身旁，献上一个银色圆盾，上面托着一城之匙。“啊国王陛下！”布阿卜迪勒说，“请收下我手中抵挡西班牙大军城门的最后一把钥匙！穆斯林帝国从此不复存在。格拉纳达城和人民为你所有；他们服从你卓越的才能，也信赖你仁慈的心灵。”“他们做得好。”国王说，“我们的承诺不应改变。但我们了解勇敢的摩尔骑士，因而格拉纳达之匙不应交给我们，而应放在更温柔之人的手上。”</p>
<p>口里说着，斐南迪将钥匙给了伊莎贝尔，出于同情——尽管她是英雄，且贵为皇后，但她却有一颗悲悯之心——她想好言宽慰布阿卜迪勒几句，但内心的情感起伏翻涌，过于激动，在她抬眼望见阴沉的帝王镇定而苍白的面容时，眼泪便一下子奔涌而出，嗓音哽咽。布阿卜迪勒的脸颊倏然绯红，气氛有一瞬间尴尬地凝固了，摩尔末代帝王首先开口打破窘况。</p>
<p>“美丽的王后，”他哀婉感伤而不失尊严地说，“您没看到您的慈悲多么让我感动，您的宽宏大量将我征服；这是您最终的征服，但辉煌却不小。而我耽搁了你们；不要让我影响你们凯旋的心情。就让我忍痛辞别吧。”“再见，我的兄弟，”斐南迪接口说道，“愿好运伴随你！忘记过去吧！”布阿卜迪勒苦笑一下，向这对皇家夫妇致以深切而无声的敬意，然后上马缓缓前行，离开了山下方的军队，攀登上通往远在阿尔帕克若斯之城的新领地的路途。国王斐南迪远远望着摩尔骑兵消失树林，于是下令三军开始行进；并吹响喇叭，猛击铙钹，凯旋的鼓乐瞬间传进摩尔人的耳朵。</p>
<p>布阿卜迪勒策马飞驰，一气奔到一个小村庄才勒住气喘吁吁的战马。这儿住着早就转送过来等他的母亲和奴仆，还有忠心爱戴他的妻子——阿米恩。接上他们，他又马不停蹄地奔上那条忧伤的路途。他们登上那座山丘，即将进入阿尔帕克若斯。这一小队人马站在这个高度，眼前出现了山谷河流，教堂熠熠的尖顶和格拉纳达的幢幢古塔；壮丽的景象迷住了骑士们，一双双眼睛望着心中热爱的圣地。勇士心中涌着羞愧，对家的温柔怀念，记忆里童年的欢乐，对故土的依依不舍之情一股脑涌进每个人的心中，又从每一双眼睛里流溢出来。</p>
<p>骤然，远空撕裂了城堡的火炮声，沿着阳光遍洒的山谷和晶光闪耀的河流轰隆隆席卷而来。这群流亡人突然齐声悲号；哭声重重地压在命运乖劫的国王心上，他徒然地用东方式的骄傲压下内心的悲伤，借助向来坚忍的人生观消解凄苦。但是他的眼泪终究还是哗哗地淌出来，他不得不双手掩面。人马慢慢地在荒寂的狭路上蠕动，而摩尔帝王号哭过的地方至今被称作“摩尔人最后一声悲叹”。</p>

<p>也必定踌躇犹疑，众生顾虑于此，</p>
<p>于是长久苦挨灾祸病罹。</p>
<p>有谁愿受世间嘲讽鞭笞，</p>
<p>受人压迫，遭人凌辱，</p>
<p>挚爱被轻贱，律法总延迟</p>
<p>弄权人骄横自负，苦苦忍耐却换得冷眼轻视，</p>
<p>若一把尖锥就能将种种不堪结束？谁又甘愿忍受，</p>
<p>于生活重负下呻吟焦急，</p>
<p>因为惧怕死后的痛苦，</p>
<p>旅往来世的人去而无返，我们意怯却步，</p>
<p>于是宁愿忍受现世的不幸，也不愿飞往未知的国度，</p>
<p>这番思想将我们都变成了懦夫，</p>
<p>于是那决心原有的光彩</p>
<p>因为重重顾虑的阴影，顿时苍白无力，</p>
<p>伟大事业也因此逆流而下，失去了行动的意义。</p>

<p>GINEVRA</p>
<p>金妮维亚</p>
<p>Samuel Rogers, 1763-1855, was the son of a London banker, and, in
company with his father, followed the banking business for some years.
He began to write at an early age, and published his “Pleasures of
Memory,” perhaps his most famous work, in 1792. The next year his father
died, leaving him an ample fortune. He now retired from business and
established himself in an elegant house in St. James’s Place. This house
was a place of resort for literary men during fifty years. In 1822 he
published his longest poem, “Italy,” after which he wrote but little. He
wrote with care, spending, as he said, nine years on the “Pleasures of
Memory,” and sixteen on “Italy.” “His writings are remarkable for
elegance of diction, purity of taste, and beauty of sentiment.” It is
said that he was very agreeable in conversation and manners, and
benevolent in his disposition; but he was addicted to ill-nature and
satire in some of his criticisms.</p>
<p>If thou shouldst ever come by choice or chance</p>
<p>To Modena,—where still religiously</p>
<p>Among her ancient trophies, is preserved</p>
<p>Bologna’s bucket (in its chain it hangs</p>
<p>Within that reverend tower, the Guirlandine),—</p>
<p>Stop at a palace near the Reggio gate,</p>
<p>Dwelt in of old by one of the Orsini.</p>
<p>Its noble gardens, terrace above terrace,</p>
<p>And rich in fountains, statues, cypresses,</p>
<p>Will long detain thee; through their arche’d walks,</p>
<p>Dim at noonday, discovering many a glimpse</p>
<p>Of knights and dames such as in old romance,</p>
<p>And lovers such as in heroic song,—</p>
<p>Perhaps the two, for groves were their delight,</p>
<p>That in the springtime, as alone they sate,</p>
<p>Venturing together on a tale of love.</p>
<p>Read only part that day.—A summer sun</p>
<p>Sets ere one half is seen; but, ere thou go,</p>
<p>Enter the house—prithee, forget it not—</p>
<p>And look awhile upon a picture there.</p>
<p>’T is of a lady in her earliest youth,</p>
<p>The very last of that illustrious race,</p>
<p>Done by Zampieri—but by whom I care not.</p>
<p>He who observes it, ere he passes on,</p>
<p>Gazes his fill, and comes and comes again,</p>
<p>That he may call it up when far away.</p>
<p>She sits, inclining forward as to speak,</p>
<p>Her lips half-open, and her finger up,</p>
<p>As though she said, ”Beware!” her vest of gold,</p>
<p>Broidered with flowers, and clasped from head to foot,</p>
<p>An emerald stone in every golden clasp;</p>
<p>And on her brow, fairer than alabaster,</p>
<p>A coronet of pearls. But then her face,</p>
<p>So lovely, yet so arch, so full of mirth,</p>
<p>The overflowings of an innocent heart,—</p>
<p>It haunts me still, though many a year has fled,</p>
<p>Like some wild melody!</p>
<p>Alone it hangs</p>
<p>Over a moldering heirloom, its companion,</p>
<p>An oaken chest, half-eaten by the worm,</p>
<p>But richly carved by Antony of Trent</p>
<p>With scripture stories from the life of Christ;</p>
<p>A chest that came from Venice, and had held</p>
<p>The ducal robes of some old ancestors—</p>
<p>That, by the way, it may be true or false—</p>
<p>But don’t forget the picture; and thou wilt not,</p>
<p>When thou hast heard the tale they told me there.</p>
<p>She was an only child; from infancy</p>
<p>The joy, the pride, of an indulgent sire;</p>
<p>The young Ginevra was his all in life,</p>
<p>Still as she grew, forever in his sight;</p>
<p>And in her fifteenth year became a bride,</p>
<p>Marrying an only son, Francesco Doria,</p>
<p>Her playmate from her birth, and her first love.</p>
<p>Just as she looks there in her bridal dress,</p>
<p>She was all gentleness, all gayety,</p>
<p>Her pranks the favorite theme of every tongue.</p>
<p>But now the day was come, the day, the hour;</p>
<p>Now, frowning, smiling, for the hundredth time,</p>
<p>The nurse, that ancient lady, preached decorum:</p>
<p>And, in the luster of her youth, she gave</p>
<p>Her hand,</p>
<p>with her heart in it, to Francesco.</p>
<p>Great was the joy; but at the bridal feast,</p>
<p>When all sate down, the bride was wanting there.</p>
<p>Nor was she to be found! Her father cried,</p>
<p>“’T is but to make a trial of our love!”</p>
<p>And filled his glass to all; but his hand shook,</p>
<p>And soon from guest to guest the panic spread.</p>
<p>’T was but that instant she had left Francesco,</p>
<p>Laughing and looking back and flying still,</p>
<p>Her ivory tooth imprinted on his finger.</p>
<p>But now, alas! she was not to be found;</p>
<p>Nor from that hour could anything be guessed,</p>
<p>But that she was not!—Weary of his life,</p>
<p>Francesco flew to Venice, and forthwith</p>
<p>Flung it away in battle with the Turk.</p>
<p>Orsini lived; and long was to be seen</p>
<p>An old man wandering as in quest of something,</p>
<p>Something he could not find—he knew not what.</p>
<p>When he was gone, the house remained a while</p>
<p>Silent and tenantless—then went to strangers.</p>
<p>Full fifty years were past, and all forgot,</p>
<p>When on an idle day, a day of search</p>
<p>’Mid the old lumber in the gallery,</p>
<p>That moldering chest was noticed; and ’t was said</p>
<p>By one as young, as thoughtless as Ginevra,</p>
<p>“Why not remove it from its lurking place?”</p>
<p>’T was done as soon as said; but on the way</p>
<p>It burst, it fell; and lo! a skeleton,</p>
<p>With here and there a pearl, an emerald stone,</p>
<p>A golden clasp, clasping a shred of gold.</p>
<p>All else had perished, save a nuptial ring,</p>
<p>And a small seal, her mother’s legacy,</p>
<p>Engraven with a name, the name of both,</p>
<p>“Ginevra.”—There then had she found a grave!</p>
<p>Within that chest had she concealed herself,</p>
<p>Fluttering with joy, the happiest of the happy;</p>
<p>When a spring lock, that lay in ambush there,</p>
<p>Fastened her down forever!</p>

<p>INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES</p>
<p>发明与发现</p>
<p>John Caldwell Calhoun, 1782-1850. This great statesman, and champion
of southern rights and opinions, was born in Abbeville District, South
Carolina. In the line of both parents, he was of Irish Presbyterian
descent. In youth he was very studious, and made the best use of such
opportunities for education as the frontier settlement afforded. He
graduated at Yale College in 1804, and studied law at Litchfield,
Connecticut. In 1808 he was elected to the Legislature of South
Carolina; and, three years later, he was chosen to the National House of
Representatives. During the six years that he remained in the House, he
took an active and prominent part in the stirring events of the time. In
1817 he was appointed Secretary of War, and held the office seven years.
From 1825 to 1832 he was Vice President of the United States. He then
resigned this office, and took his seat as senator from South Carolina.
In 1844 President Tyler called him to his Cabinet as Secretary of State;
and, in 1845, he returned to the Senate, where he remained till his
death. During all his public life Mr. Calhoun was active and outspoken.
His earnestness and logical force commanded the respect of those who
differed most widely from him in opinion. He took the most advanced
ground in favor of “State Rights,” and defended slavery as neither
morally nor politically wrong. His foes generally conceded his honesty,
and respected his ability; while his friends regarded him as little less
than an oracle.</p>
<p>In private life Mr. Calhoun was highly esteemed and respected. His
home was at “Fort Hill,” in the northwestern district of South Carolina;
and here he spent all the time he could spare from his public duties, in
the enjoyments of domestic life and in cultivating his plantation. In
his home he was remarkable for kindness, cheerfulness, and
sociability.</p>
<p>To comprehend more fully the force and bearing of public opinion, and
to form a just estimate of the changes to which, aided by the press, it
will probably lead, politically and socially, it will be necessary to
consider it in connection with the causes that have given it an
influence so great as to entitle it to be regarded as a new political
element. They will, upon investigation, be found in the many discoveries
and inventions made in the last few centuries.</p>
<p>All these have led to important results. Through the invention of the
mariner’s compass, the globe has been circumnavigated and explored; and
all who inhabit it, with but few exceptions, are brought within the
sphere of an all-pervading commerce, which is daily diffusing over its
surface the light and blessings of civilization.</p>
<p>Through that of the art of printing, the fruits of observation and
reflection, of discoveries and inventions, with all the accumulated
stores of previously acquired knowledge, are preserved and widely
diffused. The application of gunpowder to the art of war has forever
settled the long conflict for ascendency between civilization and
barbarism, in favor of the former, and thereby guaranteed that, whatever
knowledge is now accumulated, or may hereafter be added, shall never
again be lost.</p>
<p>The numerous discoveries and inventions, chemical and mechanical, and
the application of steam to machinery, have increased many fold the
productive powers of labor and capital, and have thereby greatly
increased the number who may devote themselves to study and improvement,
and the amount of means necessary for commercial exchanges, especially
between the more and the less advanced and civilized portions of the
globe, to the great advantage of both, but particularly of the
latter.</p>
<p>The application of steam to the purposes of travel and
transportation, by land and water, has vastly increased the facility,
cheapness, and rapidity of both: diffusing, with them, information and
intelligence almost as quickly and as freely as if borne by the winds;
while the electrical wires outstrip them in velocity, rivaling in
rapidity even thought itself.</p>
<p>The joint effect of all this has been a great increase and diffusion
of knowledge; and, with this, an impulse to progress and civilization
heretofore unexampled in the history of the world, accompanied by a
mental energy and activity unprecedented.</p>
<p>To all these causes, public opinion, and its organ, the press, owe
their origin and great influence. Already they have attained a force in
the more civilized portions of the globe sufficient to be felt by all
governments, even the most absolute and despotic. But, as great as they
now are, they have, as yet, attained nothing like their maximum force.
It is probable that not one of the causes which have contributed to
their formation and influence, has yet produced its full effect; while
several of the most powerful have just begun to operate; and many
others, probably of equal or even greater force, yet remain to be
brought to light.</p>
<p>When the causes now in operation have produced their full effect, and
inventions and discoveries shall have been exhausted—if that may ever
be—they will give a force to public opinion, and cause changes,
political and social, difficult to be anticipated. What will be their
final bearing, time only can decide with any certainty.</p>
<p>That they will, however, greatly improve the condition of man
ultimately, it would be impious to doubt; it would be to suppose that
the all-wise and beneficent Being, the Creator of all, had so
constituted man as that the employment of the high intellectual
faculties with which He has been pleased to endow him, in order that he
might develop the laws that control the great agents of the material
world, and make them subservient to his use, would prove to him the
cause of permanent evil, and not of permanent good.</p>

<p>为了全面地了解公众舆论的影响与导向，为了合理地判断在媒体的推波助澜下时势所可能发生的政治及社会变化，我们有必要把事物产生巨大影响的成因纳入考虑——这成因的影响力是如此巨大，可以视其为新生政治因素。在调查中，这些成因将会在近几个世纪的许多发现与发明中露出端倪。</p>
<p>所有这些发明都已经产生了重要成果。有了航海罗盘，人们得以环球航行探险；万物栖居地球，地球上的人毫无例外都被纳入了无处不在的商业圈，每日将光明与文明的福音在世界上传播。</p>
<p>通过印刷术，我们从发明与发现中看到观察与沉思的成果，先前获得的知识尽数积累保存，并且得到广泛传播。火药之于战争艺术的应用，一劳永逸地解决了文明与野蛮之间为争夺支配权而发生的持久冲突，令前者获得优势，从而保证人们永不会再度失去现已积累并或将逐渐增加的文明成果。</p>
<p>众多发现与发明里，化学和机械，以及蒸汽机的应用，使劳动效益飚升，资本翻倍增长，许多人从劳动中解放出来，将时间和精力投入到学习与自我完善，以及商贸互易所必须的各种运作中去，尤其是世界上那些文明更先进更落后的地方，都从中获得巨大的利益，尤其是落后地区。</p>
<p>蒸汽的应用实现了水上和陆地上游历与运输的目的，两者更加便利便宜快捷，随着交通的四通八达，信息和情报好像刚一诞生就如风一样自由迅速地传播开来。而电的传播速率，甚至比思想传播得还快。</p>
<p>所有发现与发明的联合效应已经大幅度增长，知识广泛传播，知识成了社会前进和文明繁荣的推动力，是世界历史长河中无可比拟的，伴随一种空前的智慧能量与活力的大飞跃。</p>
<p>对于所有这些推动社会前进和文明发展的滥觞，应该归功于公众舆论以及宣传机构，新闻的影响在最初起着推波助澜的巨大作用。而世界上更加开化的地方，社会进步与文明已经形成一种力量，所有政府都充分感觉到了这股力量，即使最专制独裁的政府也概莫能免。然而直到目前，推动社会进步的能量还没有爆发出终极力量。或许促成社会进步力的形成和势力的成因不只一种，但是已经充分发挥了作用；而其中几个影响力最大的社会进步已经开始运用；许多其他的社会进步力，或许有等同甚或更强大的影响力，但是尚待人类去发现。</p>
<p>现在投入运用的发明成果已经充分起作用，但是发明与发现终将有耗尽的时候——这一天到来——委实难料，它们是否会触发强大的公众舆论，引起政治社会的革命。它们的最终导向，唯有等待时间来判定。</p>
<p>然而这些发现与发明终将使人类的生存条件产生质的飞跃，怀疑这点是毫无信仰的表现；怀疑这点，就是假设至睿至仁的生灵，那创造万物的主，在造人的时候就欣然赋予人充分运用高智能的能力，以便人能够开发出控制这个物质世界的伟大自然力的律法，使得大自然为人类所用，却只是为了向人类证明永恒的恶因，而非永恒的善果。</p>

<p>ENOCH ARDEN AT THE WINDOW</p>
<p>窗前的伊诺克·雅顿</p>
<p>Alfred Tennyson, 1809-1892, was born in Somerby, Lincolnshire,
England; his father was a clergyman noted for his energy and physical
stature. Alfred, with his two older brothers, graduated at Trinity
College, Cambridge. His first volume of poems appeared in 1830; it made
little impression, and was severely treated by the critics. On the
publication of his third series, in 1842, his poetic genius began to
receive general recognition. On the death of Wordsworth he was made poet
laureate, and he was then regarded as the foremost living poet of
England. “In Memoriam,” written in memory of his friend Arthur Hallam,
appeared in 1850; the “Idyls of the King,” in 1858; and “Enoch Arden,” a
touching story in verse, from which the following selection is taken,
was published in 1864. In 1883 he accepted a peerage as Baron Tennyson
of Aldworth, Sussex, and of Freshwater, Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>But Enoch yearned to see her face again;</p>
<p>“If I might look on her sweet face again</p>
<p>And know that she is happy.” So the thought</p>
<p>Haunted and harassed him, and drove him forth,</p>
<p>At evening when the dull November day</p>
<p>Was growing duller twilight, to the hill.</p>
<p>There he sat down gazing on all below;</p>
<p>There did a thousand memories roll upon him,</p>
<p>Unspeakable for sadness. By and by</p>
<p>The ruddy square of comfortable light,</p>
<p>Far-blazing from the rear of Philip’s house,</p>
<p>Allured him, as the beacon blaze allures</p>
<p>The bird of passage, till he mildly strikes</p>
<p>Against it, and beats out his weary life.</p>
<p>For Philip’s dwelling fronted on the street,</p>
<p>The latest house to landward; but behind,</p>
<p>With one small gate that opened on the waste,</p>
<p>Flourished a little garden, square and walled:</p>
<p>And in it throve an ancient evergreen,</p>
<p>A yew tree, and all round it ran a walk</p>
<p>Of shingle, and a walk divided it:</p>
<p>But Enoch shunned the middle walk, and stole</p>
<p>Up by the wall, behind the yew; and thence</p>
<p>That which he better might have shunned, if griefs</p>
<p>Like his have worse or better, Enoch saw.</p>
<p>For cups and silver on the burnished board</p>
<p>Sparkled and shone; so genial was the hearth:</p>
<p>And on the right hand of the hearth he saw</p>
<p>Philip, the slighted suitor of old times,</p>
<p>Stout, rosy, with his babe across his knees;</p>
<p>And o’er her second father stooped a girl,</p>
<p>A later but a loftier Annie Lee,</p>
<p>Fair-haired and tall, and from her lifted hand</p>
<p>Dangled a length of ribbon and a ring</p>
<p>To tempt the babe, who reared his creasy arms,</p>
<p>Caught at and ever missed it, and they laughed:</p>
<p>And on the left hand of the hearth he saw</p>
<p>The mother glancing often toward her babe,</p>
<p>But turning now and then to speak with him,</p>
<p>Her son, who stood beside her tall and strong,</p>
<p>And saying that which pleased him, for he smiled.</p>
<p>Now when the dead man come to life beheld</p>
<p>His wife, his wife no more, and saw the babe,</p>
<p>Hers, yet not his, upon the father’s knee,</p>
<p>And all the warmth, the peace, the happiness.</p>
<p>And his own children tall and beautiful,</p>
<p>And him, that other, reigning in his place,</p>
<p>Lord of his rights and of his children’s love,</p>
<p>Then he, tho’ Miriam Lane had told him all,</p>
<p>Because things seen are mightier than things heard,</p>
<p>Staggered and shook, holding the branch, and feared</p>
<p>To send abroad a shrill and terrible cry,</p>
<p>Which in one moment, like the blast of doom,</p>
<p>Would shatter all the happiness of the hearth.</p>
<p>He, therefore, turning softly like a thief,</p>
<p>Lest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot,</p>
<p>And feeling all along the garden wall,</p>
<p>Lest he should swoon and tumble and be found,</p>
<p>Crept to the gate, and opened it, and closed,</p>
<p>As lightly as a sick man’s chamber door,</p>
<p>Behind him, and came out upon the waste.</p>
<p>And there he would have knelt but that his knees</p>
<p>Were feeble, so that falling prone he dug</p>
<p>His fingers into the wet earth, and prayed.</p>
<p>“Too hard to bear! why did they take me thence?</p>
<p>O God Almighty, blessed Savior, Thou</p>
<p>That did’st uphold me on my lonely isle,</p>
<p>Uphold me, Father, in my loneliness</p>
<p>A little longer! aid me, give me strength</p>
<p>Not to tell her, never to let her know.</p>
<p>Help me not to break in upon her peace.</p>
<p>My children too! must I not speak to these?</p>
<p>They know me not. I should betray myself.</p>
<p>Never!—no father’s kiss for me!—the girl</p>
<p>So like her mother, and the boy, my son!”</p>
<p>There speech and thought and nature failed a little,</p>
<p>And he lay tranced; but when he rose and paced</p>
<p>Back toward his solitary home again,</p>
<p>All down the long and narrow street he went</p>
<p>Beating it in upon his weary brain,</p>
<p>As tho’ it were the burden of a song,</p>
<p>“Not to tell her, never to let her know.”</p>

<p>然而，雅顿渴望再看她一眼，</p>
<p>“我只要再看一眼那张甜美的脸，</p>
<p>只要知道她过得幸福就好。”这想法</p>
<p>纠缠不休，逼迫他迈步向前，</p>
<p>傍晚时分，这荒漠无情的十一月天，</p>
<p>脸色越发沉暗，爬上山，</p>
<p>他在那儿坐下，把山下的全景俯瞰；</p>
<p>往事如潮水袭来，心上搦痛，难以言传。不久</p>
<p>一片舒适的红光从菲利普家后窗远远闪耀，</p>
<p>吸引着他，一如暗夜的塔灯吸引倦飞的鸟，</p>
<p>终于一腔柔情地撞上灯塔，结束一生的劳倦。</p>
<p>菲利普家，位于街道对面</p>
<p>那幢房临海最近；然而屋后，</p>
<p>一扇开着的小门，通向荒野，</p>
<p>绿意葱茏的，是墙内一方小小花园，</p>
<p>一棵古老的常青树，</p>
<p>一株紫杉，四周鹅卵石小路蜿蜒，</p>
<p>一条小径两分花园：</p>
<p>但雅顿避开中间小径，悄然</p>
<p>翻墙而过，藏身紫杉树后；</p>
<p>倘若悲喜失控，雅顿发现，</p>
<p>那株紫杉可以把他遮掩。</p>
<p>洁净的木板上，茶杯与餐具</p>
<p>明光闪亮；炉火如春温暖:</p>
<p>触目所及，菲利普坐在壁炉右边，</p>
<p>过去那个微不足道的求婚者，</p>
<p>又矮又胖，面庞红润，膝上坐着小宝贝；</p>
<p>她的继父倚着个名叫李安妮的女孩，</p>
<p>这个后来者却亦更得宠爱，</p>
<p>只见她金发柔软，高挑身材，举起的手中</p>
<p>悬荡着一块勋表，一串入耳的铃声</p>
<p>逗得婴儿挥舞着胖嘟嘟的小手臂，</p>
<p>几欲抓取，又总是错过，引得一家人笑声一片。</p>
<p>然后他看见壁炉的左边，</p>
<p>那位母亲不时地向她的小宝贝瞥一眼，</p>
<p>偶尔转身和站在身旁体格魁梧的儿子交谈，</p>
<p>母亲的话一定逗乐了他，看他笑脸如花绽。</p>
<p>当生还的亡夫偷偷观察着一切</p>
<p>不再是他妻子的妻子，眼望着婴儿，</p>
<p>属于她却不是他的宝贝，坐在父亲的膝上，</p>
<p>所有的温暖、祥和、快乐非他所属。</p>
<p>他自己的孩子们高大漂亮，</p>
<p>而那个男人占据了他的位置，</p>
<p>代他行使丈夫的权利，享受他儿女们的爱戴，</p>
<p>尽管米里亚姆已给他讲述过这一切，</p>
<p>亲眼所见可能比听传言更加刺心灼目。</p>
<p>此刻，他还是蹒跚欲倒浑身抖颤，紧抓树枝，唯恐</p>
<p>那一声心如锥刺的痛哭爆破胸腔，</p>
<p>就在一瞬间，如同摧枯拉朽的爆炸，</p>
<p>让壁炉旁的一切幸福烟消云散。</p>
<p>于是，他像个窃贼，轻轻转身，</p>
<p>轻踩着粗粝的鹅卵石，唯恐脚下闹出动静，</p>
<p>摸着墙壁前行，只怕昏晕倒地，被人发现。</p>
<p>蹑足至门前，轻轻推开，关闭，</p>
<p>小心之态，犹如关上的是病人的房门，</p>
<p>转身，他走进荒野。</p>
<p>本欲跪倒那儿，然而双膝</p>
<p>如此虚弱无力，一下扑倒，十指插进</p>
<p>潮湿的泥土，哀哀祈祷。</p>
<p>“如何承受！他们为何让我落入如此地步？</p>
<p>哦，万能的上帝啊，我神圣的救世主，你</p>
<p>在孤独的岛上鼓励我，</p>
<p>天父，在我独饮寂寞时，支持我，</p>
<p>再久一些！请你帮我，给我力量，</p>
<p>让我守住孤独，永远不让她知道。</p>
<p>请给我忍耐，不要打乱她的宁静生活。</p>
<p>我的孩子们亦然！我必须守住秘密？</p>
<p>他们不知我是谁。我应该真相大白吗？</p>
<p>绝不可以！——孩子们不会亲吻我这个父亲！——那女孩</p>
<p>酷似她的妈妈，男孩，我的儿子，一如我的模样！”</p>
<p>然而他的祈祷与思想和他的本我相背，</p>
<p>他恍恍惚惚地躺着；当他站起身举步前行</p>
<p>再次返回那条孤独的回家之路，</p>
<p>沿着狭长的街道，</p>
<p>一句话反复敲打着他的神经，</p>
<p>仿佛一句低沉的叠歌，</p>
<p>“不要告诉她，永远别让她知道。”</p>

<p>LOCHINVAR</p>
<p>洛钦瓦尔</p>
<p>Oh, young Lochinvar is come out of the west,</p>
<p>Through all the wide Border his steed was the best;</p>
<p>And save his good broadsword, he weapon had none,</p>
<p>He rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone!</p>
<p>So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,</p>
<p>There never was knight like the young Lochinvar!</p>
<p>He stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for stone,</p>
<p>He swam the Eske River where ford there was none;</p>
<p>But ere he alighted at Netherby gate,</p>
<p>The bride had consented, the gallant came late:</p>
<p>For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,</p>
<p>Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar!</p>
<p>So boldly he entered the Netherby hall,</p>
<p>Among bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:</p>
<p>Then spoke the bride’s father, his hand on his sword—</p>
<p>For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word—</p>
<p>“Oh, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,</p>
<p>Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?”</p>
<p>“I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied;—</p>
<p>Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide—</p>
<p>And now am I come, with this lost love of mine,</p>
<p>To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.</p>
<p>There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,</p>
<p>That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.”</p>
<p>The bride kissed the goblet; the knight took it up,</p>
<p>He quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the cup.</p>
<p>She looked down to blush, and she looked up to sigh,</p>
<p>With a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.</p>
<p>He took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,</p>
<p>“Now tread we a measure!” said young Lochinvar.</p>
<p>So stately his form, and so lovely her face,</p>
<p>That never a hall such a galliard did grace;</p>
<p>While her mother did fret, and her father did fume,</p>
<p>And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;</p>
<p>And the bridemaidens whispered, “’Twere better by far</p>
<p>To have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.”</p>
<p>One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,</p>
<p>When they reached the hall door, and the charger stood near,</p>
<p>So light to the croup the fair lady he swung,</p>
<p>So light to the saddle before her he sprung!</p>
<p>“She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur:</p>
<p>They’ll have fleet steeds that follow,” quoth young Lochinvar.</p>
<p>There was mounting ’mong Graemes of the Netherby clan;</p>
<p>Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran;</p>
<p>There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,</p>
<p>But the lost bride of Netherby ne’er did they see.</p>
<p>So daring in love, and so dauntless in war,</p>
<p>Have ye e’er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?</p>

<p>SPEECH ON THE TRIAL OF A MURDERER</p>
<p>关于审判一个谋杀犯的演讲</p>
<p>Against the prisoner at the bar, as an individual, I can not have the
slightest prejudice. I would not do him the smallest injury or
injustice. But I do not affect to be indifferent to the discovery and
the punishment of this deep guilt. I cheerfully share in the opprobrium,
how much soever it may be, which is cast on those who feel and manifest
an anxious concern that all who had a part in planning, or a hand in
executing this deed of midnight assassination, may be brought to answer
for their enormous crime at the bar of public justice.</p>
<p>This is a most extraordinary case. In some respects it has hardly a
precedent anywhere; certainly none in our New England history. This
bloody drama exhibited no suddenly excited, ungovernable rage. The
actors in it were not surprised by any lionlike temptation springing
upon their virtue, and overcoming it before resistance could begin. Nor
did they do the deed to glut savage vengeance, or satiate long-settled
and deadly hate. It was a cool, calculating, money-making murder. It was
all “hire and salary, not revenge.” It was the weighing of money against
life; the counting out of so many pieces of silver against so many
ounces of blood.</p>
<p>An aged man, without an enemy in the world, in his own house, and in
his own bed, is made the victim of a butcherly murder for mere pay.
Truly, here is a new lesson for painters and poets. Whoever shall
hereafter draw the portrait of murder, if he will show it as it has been
exhibited in an example, where such example was last to have been looked
for, in the very bosom of our New England society, let him not give it
the grim visage of Moloch, the brow knitted by revenge, the face black
with settled hate, and the bloodshot eye emitting livid fires of malice.
Let him draw, rather, a decorous, smooth-faced, bloodless demon; a
picture in repose, rather than in action; not so much an example of
human nature in its depravity, and in its paroxysms of crime, as an
infernal nature, a fiend in the ordinary display and development of his
character.</p>
<p>The deed was executed with a degree of self-possession and steadiness
equal to the wickedness with which it was planned. The circumstances,
now clearly in evidence, spread out the whole scene before us. Deep
sleep had fallen on the destined victim, and on all beneath his roof. A
healthful old man, to whom sleep was sweet,—the first sound slumbers of
the night held him in their soft but strong embrace. The assassin enters
through the window, already prepared, into an unoccupied apartment. With
noiseless foot he paces the lonely hall, half-lighted by the moon; he
winds up the ascent of the stairs, and reaches the door of the chamber.
Of this, he moves the lock by soft and continued pressure till it turns
on its hinges without noise; and he enters, and beholds his victim
before him. The room was uncommonly open to the admission of light. The
face of the innocent sleeper was turned from the murderer, and the beams
of the moon, resting on the gray locks of his aged temple, showed him
where to strike. The fatal blow is given! and the victim passes, without
a struggle or a motion, from the repose of sleep to the repose of
death!</p>
<p>It is the assassin’s purpose to make sure work; and he yet plies the
dagger, though it was obvious that life had been destroyed by the blow
of the bludgeon. He even raises the aged arm, that he may not fail in
his aim at the heart; and replaces it again over the wounds of the
poniard! To finish the picture, he explores the wrist for the pulse! He
feels for it, and ascertains that it beats no longer! It is
accomplished. The deed is done. He retreats, retraces his steps to the
window, passes out through it as he came in, and escapes. He has done
the murder; no eye has seen him, no ear has heard him. The secret is his
own, and it is safe!</p>
<p>Ah! gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a secret can be safe
nowhere. The whole creation of God has neither nook nor corner where the
guilty can bestow it, and say it is safe. Not to speak of that eye which
glances through all disguises, and beholds everything as in the splendor
of noon; such secrets of guilt are never safe from detection, even by
men. True it is, generally speaking, that “murder will out.” True it is
that Providence hath so ordained, and doth so govern things, that those
who break the great law of Heaven by shedding man’s blood, seldom
succeed in avoiding discovery. Especially, in a case exciting so much
attention as this, discovery must come, and wilt come, sooner or later.
A thousand eyes turn at once to explore every man, everything, every
circumstance connected with the time and place; a thousand ears catch
every whisper; a thousand excited minds intensely dwell on the scene,
shedding all their light, and ready to kindle the slightest circumstance
into a blaze of discovery.</p>
<p>Meantime, the guilty soul can not keep its own secret. It is false to
itself, or rather it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be
true to itself. It labors under its guilty possession, and knows not
what to do with it. The human heart was not made for the residence of
such an inhabitant. It finds itself preyed on by a torment, which it
dares not acknowledge to God nor man. A vulture is devouring it, and it
can ask no sympathy or assistance either from heaven or earth. The
secret which the murderer possesses soon comes to possess him; and, like
the evil spirits of which we read, it overcomes him, and leads him
whithersoever it will. He feels it beating at his heart, rising to his
throat, and demanding disclosure. He thinks the whole world sees it in
his face, reads it in his eyes, and almost hears its workings in the
very silence of his thoughts. It has become his master. It betrays his
discretion, it breaks down his courage, it conquers his prudence. When
suspicions from without begin to embarrass him, and the net of
circumstance to entangle him, the fatal secret struggles with still
greater violence to burst forth. It must be confessed, it will be
confessed; there is no refuge from confession but suicide, and suicide
is confession.</p>

<p>针对那站在审判席上的被告，作为个人而言，我不会持有丝毫偏见。我既不会给被告一点点损害，也不会让他承受不公待遇。但对这桩严重罪行的侦破与惩罚，我不会假装漠不关心。所有参与谋划或动手执行这次午夜暗杀的人，要站到审判席上，为他们的重罪受到正义的审判；有些人会对社会上出现这样的罪人感到焦虑而痛心——我就是他们之中的一员，因而我很乐意分担这种耻辱感，无论它来自何方、有多严重。</p>
<p>这是一宗极其离奇的案件。从某些方面来看，不论哪里出现这样的案件都实属罕见；当然在我们新英格兰历史中更没有这样的先例。这出血腥味十足的戏剧并未展示突如其来的激动，亦非出于抑制不住的愤怒。这戏中的演员，并不会为自己的行径大吃一惊——他们并非是来不及抵抗就被野兽般的邪念攫住了道德心。他们既没有采取过度残酷的复仇行动，也没有对长期沉淀心底的极端仇恨感到厌腻。这是一宗经过深谋远虑、周密计划的谋杀，目的是为赚取钱财。这完全就是出于“酬金而非报仇”。这是金钱与生命对抗的权衡；数出多少块银币，就有多少盎司鲜血为代价。</p>
<p>一位老人，从不与人为敌，却死在自己家里、自己的床上，那个残忍的刺客仅仅是为了酬金将老人杀害了。确实，这是给画家和诗人提供了活生生的素材。此后无论谁画出杀人犯的相貌，如果要画得和实例相同——而这个例子就出现在是我们最新觅得的，就发生在我们新英格兰社会的内部——那就请画家别画摩罗神的冷酷表情，别画因复仇而扭结的眉毛，别画因憎恨而铁青的面容，别画喷射着怨毒之火的眼睛。我宁愿让他画一个相貌端正、表情平和、面无血色的魔鬼；一个睡着而不是施恶的魔鬼；不要过分渲染处于突发性犯罪行为中的人类本性的邪恶，正如不要过分着墨于处在平常的表现与个性发展中的魔鬼本性。</p>
<p>这种泰然自若沉着坚定地实行谋杀的行为和策划凶杀一样邪恶，罪不容恕。现在证据确凿，谋杀现场的情形整个在我们面前展开了。沉睡者成了命定的牺牲品，罪恶就在他自己的房屋下发生。一位健康的老人正在酣睡，在这深沉的夜晚之中，鼾声柔和有力地一声接着一声。这时刺客潜窗而入，准备进入一间空室。刺客举步无声来到空寂的半胧月光倾洒的大厅；悄无声息地迈上楼梯，潜至内室门口。这当儿，刺客轻轻扭动锁片，压着把手，直到铰链无声打开；他溜进去，站在受害人床前阴冷地看着他。这间房极其宽敞，月光自由地泻落。而酣睡者那张无辜的脸背对着刺客，月光照在老人灰白的太阳穴上，正好给了刺客下手的要害。于是刺客无需二下，一击得手，死者连动一下都没有，就从睡眠的安静一下子陷入了死亡的安静！</p>
<p>刺客的目的是杀人不留活口；尽管很明显死者一击毙命，已没有生命迹象，但是他还是拿起了匕首，举起老人手臂，在他心脏补上一刀；然后将老人手臂放回刀口上！做完这些，他还不忘摸一下老人手腕一测脉搏！确定是真的没有了脉动！这个杀人犯手法何其老练，技巧多么娴熟。之后他撤身折回窗口，跳出窗从原路逃逸。他已经犯下罪恶；但是没有人目睹他的踪影，没有人听到罪恶的声息。这个秘密只有自己知道，他以为可以逃脱罪罚，安然度日！</p>
<p>啊！先生们，这是个可怕的误解。这样的滔天秘密放哪儿都不安全。宇宙之主不会让罪犯藏匿角落，使其逍遥法外无从查找。更别说他一眼洞穿所有的伪装，如同高天白日下明见一切；罪恶的隐秘永远无法幸免于侦查，甚至是假人之手施行的罪恶也不例外。这是事实，人们常说，“杀人不偿命。”事实上，上帝如此规定，也如此统治万物，凡是让别人流血触犯天条者，鲜有人侥幸逃脱。尤其是这样一宗令人极其关注的大案，罪恶的秘密迟早大白天下。无数双眼睛探究着与案发时间地点有关的每个人、每一物和每个情况；数不清的耳朵捕听着每一声低语，成千上万人怀着激动的心情紧张地思考犯罪现场的细微末节，从各个角度，准备找到蛛丝马迹，点燃真相大白的火焰。</p>
<p>同时，罪犯的灵魂也不可能守住秘密。与其说他的灵魂背叛了它本身，倒不如说是要忠实于它自己的良知无法抑制冲动。良知在罪恶感的重压下，不知如何是好。人心是不允许这样一个寄居者久留的。结果他的内心被痛苦折磨，备受煎熬，却不敢向上帝或是人们坦承罪恶。一只贪婪的秃鹫正在啄食他的良心，但此时的良心不要上帝的安慰，也不会向世人求助。这时杀人的秘密立刻来占据他的心；犹如我们从书中看到的邪魔，将他的理智攻克，受其牵引。他感到秘密之魔在他心房拳打脚踢，冲上了咽喉，急欲一吐为快。他觉得全世界的人都看到了毕现于他脸上与眼里的秘密，即便他在静思默想，人们一样听到了魔鬼的动静。这股魔力奴役了他的意志。打乱其判断力，摧其胆气，克其谨慎。怀疑对象还没有锁定他的时候，这张环境大网就把他紧紧困住了，那个杀人秘密仍然激烈斗争，急欲昭告天下。他必须坦白秘密，供认不讳；不然守秘的唯一后路是自杀，而自杀即是坦白。</p>

<p>THE CLOSING YEAR</p>
<p>逝年</p>
<p>George Denison Prentice, 1802-1870, widely known as a political
writer, a poet, and a wit, was born in Preston, Connecticut, and
graduated at Brown University in 1823. He studied law, but never
practiced his profession. He edited a paper in Hartford for two years;
and, in 1831, he became editor of the “Louisville Journal,” which
position he held for nearly forty years. As an editor, Mr. Prentice was
an able, and sometimes bitter, political partisan, abounding in wit and
satire; as a poet, he not only wrote gracefully himself, but he did much
by his kindness and sympathy to develop the poetical talents of others.
Some who have since taken high rank, first became known to the world
through the columns of the “Louisville Journal.”</p>
<p>’T is midnight’s holy hour, and silence now</p>
<p>Is brooding like a gentle spirit o’er</p>
<p>The still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds,</p>
<p>The bell’s deep notes are swelling; ’t is the knell</p>
<p>Of the departed year.</p>
<p>No funeral train</p>
<p>Is sweeping past; yet, on the stream and wood,</p>
<p>With melancholy light, the moonbeams rest</p>
<p>Like a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred</p>
<p>As by a mourner’s sigh; and, on yon cloud,</p>
<p>That floats so still and placidly through heaven,</p>
<p>The spirits of the Seasons seem to stand—</p>
<p>Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn’s solemn form,</p>
<p>And Winter, with his aged locks—and breathe</p>
<p>In mournful cadences, that come abroad</p>
<p>Like the far wind harp’s wild and touching wail,</p>
<p>A melancholy dirge o’er the dead year,</p>
<p>Gone from the earth forever.</p>
<p>’T is a time</p>
<p>For memory and for tears. Within the deep,</p>
<p>Still chambers of the heart, a specter dim,</p>
<p>Whose tones are like the wizard voice of Time,</p>
<p>Heard from the tomb of ages, points its cold</p>
<p>And solemn finger to the beautiful</p>
<p>And holy visions, that have passed away,</p>
<p>And left no shadow of their loveliness</p>
<p>On the dead waste of life. That specter lifts</p>
<p>The coffin lid of Hope, and Joy, and Love,</p>
<p>And, bending mournfully above the pale,</p>
<p>Sweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead flowers</p>
<p>O’er what has passed to nothingness.</p>
<p>The year</p>
<p>Has gone, and, with it, many a glorious throng</p>
<p>Of happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,</p>
<p>Its shadow in each heart. In its swift course</p>
<p>It waved its scepter o’er the beautiful,</p>
<p>And they are not. It laid its pallid hand</p>
<p>Upon the strong man; and the haughty form</p>
<p>Is fallen, and the flashing eye is dim.</p>
<p>It trod the hall of revelry, where thronged</p>
<p>The bright and joyous; and the tearful wail</p>
<p>Of stricken ones is heard, where erst the song</p>
<p>And reckless shout resounded. It passed o’er</p>
<p>The battle plain, where sword, and spear, and shield</p>
<p>Flashed in the light of midday; and the strength</p>
<p>Of serried hosts is shivered, and the grass,</p>
<p>Green from the soil of carnage, waves above</p>
<p>The crushed and moldering skeleton. It came,</p>
<p>And faded like a wreath of mist at eve;</p>
<p>Yet, ere it melted in the viewless air,</p>
<p>It heralded its millions to their home</p>
<p>In the dim land of dreams.</p>
<p>Remorseless Time!—</p>
<p>Fierce spirit of the glass and scythe!—what power</p>
<p>Can stay him in his silent course, or melt</p>
<p>His iron heart to pity! On, still on</p>
<p>He presses, and forever. The proud bird,</p>
<p>The condor of the Andes, that can soar</p>
<p>Through heaven’s unfathomable depths, or brave</p>
<p>The fury of the northern hurricane,</p>
<p>And bathe his plumage in the thunder’s home,</p>
<p>Furls his broad wings at nightfall, and sinks down</p>
<p>To rest upon his mountain crag; but Time</p>
<p>Knows not the weight of sleep or weariness;</p>
<p>And Night’s deep darkness has no chain to bind</p>
<p>His rushing pinion.</p>
<p>Revolutions sweep</p>
<p>O’er earth, like troubled visions o’er the breast</p>
<p>Of dreaming sorrow; cities rise and sink</p>
<p>Like bubbles on the water; fiery isles</p>
<p>Spring blazing from the ocean, and go back</p>
<p>To their mysterious caverns; mountains rear</p>
<p>To heaven their bald and blackened cliffs, and bow</p>
<p>Their tall heads to the plain; new empires rise,</p>
<p>Gathering the strength of hoary centuries,</p>
<p>And rush down, like the Alpine avalanche,</p>
<p>Startling the nations; and the very stars,</p>
<p>Yon bright and burning blazonry of God,</p>
<p>Glitter awhile in their eternal depths,</p>
<p>And, like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,</p>
<p>Shoot from their glorious spheres, and pass away,</p>
<p>To darkle in the trackless void; yet Time,</p>
<p>Time the tomb builder, holds his fierce career,</p>
<p>Dark, stern, all pitiless, and pauses not</p>
<p>Amid the mighty wrecks that strew his path,</p>
<p>To sit and muse, like other conquerors,</p>
<p>Upon the fearful ruin he has wrought.</p>

<p>午夜圣时，寂静</p>
<p>像个轻柔的幽灵，</p>
<p>徘徊于了无生趣的世界上空。听！迎风而上，</p>
<p>一声强似一声的，是低沉的钟鸣；那是哀悼</p>
<p>一年的消逝。</p>
<p>没有送葬的队伍</p>
<p>从此经过；然而，溪水含愁，树林呜咽，</p>
<p>忧郁的灯火闪烁，月色倾洒，</p>
<p>像一件纤尘不染的灰白寿裳；似哀悼者</p>
<p>一声幽叹搅动了气流；而远方的云朵，</p>
<p>如此平静安然，飘向天国，</p>
<p>季节的精灵似乎偏爱</p>
<p>青春的蓬勃，晴夏的明朗，凉秋的庄肃，</p>
<p>而冬，顶着发髻上的岁月沧桑，</p>
<p>哀恸地低语，那声调</p>
<p>像远方风弦琴的悲号，荒凉、感伤，</p>
<p>一曲挽歌抹去逝年的足迹，</p>
<p>永远消失于尘世。</p>
<p>这段时光</p>
<p>给回忆复活，让眼泪流淌。在心房，</p>
<p>平静的深处，一个幽灵模糊，</p>
<p>他的语调犹如时间之神巫蛊的嗓音，</p>
<p>传出岁月的坟墓，深凉的禅指，</p>
<p>指点世间愿景，一切随之消失，</p>
<p>生命虚化的荒地，不留可爱的影子。幽灵掀起</p>
<p>盛着希望、欢笑与爱这三位女神的棺盖，</p>
<p>哀伤地，向那苍白</p>
<p>甜美沉睡的人儿躬身，撒上枯萎的香蕊，</p>
<p>向虚无的生命奠以花祭。</p>
<p>这一年</p>
<p>已消逝，也带走多少</p>
<p>美妙梦想。给每人的额头刻上印痕，</p>
<p>将阴影镌刻众生的心上。一路如飞</p>
<p>在万般景致之上，挥舞权杖，</p>
<p>于是好花不再，好景不长。那苍白的手</p>
<p>轻轻往强壮的人身上一放；于是结实的身体</p>
<p>无力地倾倒，明亮的眼眸顿失神光。</p>
<p>它走入欢宴的大厅，踏碎灯火的光明，</p>
<p>驱散满堂的欢乐；此时入耳的声声饮泣</p>
<p>是受伤人不堪忍受的痛，一首老歌</p>
<p>伴着悲号在大厅回荡。它飞掠</p>
<p>战争之平原，原上的刀剑、盾牌与长矛</p>
<p>映射午阳，闪出凛凛寒光；林立的战者</p>
<p>失去了士气，绿草</p>
<p>从大屠杀过的泥土中生长，绿波摇摇</p>
<p>隐现枯骨。它就像</p>
<p>鸿蒙初开的大雾花环，倏忽曾现又隐去；</p>
<p>然而，当它即将溶于虚无的穹苍，</p>
<p>先已昭告众生</p>
<p>去往那虚幻的幽冥之乡。</p>
<p>无情的时间之神！</p>
<p>这玻璃与镰刀的残忍幽灵！——什么力量</p>
<p>才能使你入静，什么热情</p>
<p>能感动这铁石心肠！向前，仍旧向前</p>
<p>向前推进，他永不停息。那只骄傲的</p>
<p>安第斯山脉的神鹰，飞越天国无际的深渊，</p>
<p>迎向北方狂怒飓风，</p>
<p>双翅沐浴万钧雷霆，</p>
<p>于黄昏时分，收拢垂天之翼，栖落于</p>
<p>云崖峭壁；然而时间之神</p>
<p>不懂睡眠的意义，不知劳倦的分量；</p>
<p>即使深夜的黑暗也没能锁住</p>
<p>他那轮子滴答前进。</p>
<p>革命浪潮</p>
<p>席卷世界，就像混乱的幻象</p>
<p>袭扰梦中忧伤的胸膛；</p>
<p>一座座城市立起又沉没，</p>
<p>犹如水中破灭的泡沫；火山群岛</p>
<p>从无际的大海中喷吐怒火，继而又沉入</p>
<p>神秘的海底洞穴；巍巍群山</p>
<p>那耸入云天的峭壁巉岩，</p>
<p>朝着广阔平原鞠下高高的头颅，一个个新帝国升起，</p>
<p>积聚了古老世纪的多少能量，</p>
<p>却顷刻瓦解，犹如阿尔卑斯山的大雪崩，</p>
<p>使不安定的国家惊悚；那几颗明星，</p>
<p>是上帝在远方愉快而热烈的炫示，</p>
<p>闪烁在永恒的穹隆之渊，</p>
<p>又像七星姐妹，排着最可爱的队列，</p>
<p>从辉煌的球体射出光芒，然后消失，</p>
<p>遁形于无迹可循的虚空；然而时间，</p>
<p>这个坟墓的缔造者，履行着他那残忍的职业，</p>
<p>阴郁、严厉又冷酷决绝，</p>
<p>即使他的途中遍是尸骨残骸，</p>
<p>也不会稍停，像其他征服者那样，</p>
<p>面对他一手造成的可怕废墟</p>
<p>坐下来沉思片刻。</p>

<p>A NEW CITY IN COLORADO</p>
<p>科罗拉多的新城</p>
<p>Helen Hunt Jackson, 1830-1885, was the daughter of the late Professor
Nathan W. Fiske, of Amherst College. She was born in Amherst, and
educated at Ipswich, Massachusetts, and at New York. Mrs. Jackson was
twice married. In the latter years of her life, she became deeply
interested in the Indians, and wrote two books, “Ramona,” a novel, and
“A Century of Dishonor,” setting forth vividly the wrongs to which the
red race has been subjected. She had previously published several books
of prose and poetry, less important but charming in their way. The
following selection is adapted from “Bits of Travel at Home.”</p>
<p>Garland City is six miles from Fort Garland. The road to it from the
fort lies for the last three miles on the top of a sage-grown plateau.
It is straight as an arrow, looks in the distance like a brown furrow on
the pale gray plain, and seems to pierce the mountains beyond. Up to
within an eighth of a mile of Garland City, there is no trace of human
habitation. Knowing that the city must be near, you look in all
directions for a glimpse of it; the hills ahead of you rise sharply
across your way. Where is the city? At your very feet, but you do not
suspect it.</p>
<p>The sunset light was fading when we reached the edge of the ravine in
which the city lies. It was like looking unawares over the edge of a
precipice; the gulch opened beneath us as suddenly as if the earth had
that moment parted and made it. With brakes set firm, we drove
cautiously down the steep road; the ravine twinkled with lights, and
almost seemed to flutter with white tents and wagon tops. At the farther
end it widened, opening out on an inlet of the San Luis Park; and, in
its center, near this widening mouth, lay the twelve-days-old city. A
strange din arose from it.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” we exclaimed. “The building of the city,” was the
reply. “Twelve days ago there was not a house here. To-day there are one
hundred and five, and in a week more there will be two hundred; each man
is building his own home, and working day and night to get it done ahead
of his neighbor. There are four sawmills going constantly, but they
can’t turn out lumber half fast enough. Everybody has to be content with
a board at a time. If it were not for that, there would have been twice
as many houses done as there are.”</p>
<p>We drove on down the ravine. A little creek on our right was half hid
in willow thickets. Hundreds of white tents gleamed among them: tents
with poles; tents made by spreading sailcloth over the tops of bushes;
round tents; square tents; big tents; little tents; and for every tent a
camp fire; hundreds of white-topped wagons, also, at rest for the night,
their great poles propped up by sticks, and their mules and drivers
lying and standing in picturesque groups around them.</p>
<p>It was a scene not to be forgotten. Louder and louder sounded the
chorus of the hammers as we drew near the center of the “city;” more and
more the bustle thickened; great ox teams swaying unwieldily about,
drawing logs and planks, backing up steep places; all sorts of vehicles
driving at reckless speed up and down; men carrying doors; men walking
along inside of window sashes,—the easiest way to carry them; men
shoveling; men wheeling wheelbarrows; not a man standing still; not a
man with empty hands; every man picking up something, and running to put
it down somewhere else, as in a play; and, all the while, “Clink! clink!
clink!” ringing above the other sounds,—the strokes of hundreds of
hammers, like the “Anvil Chorus.”</p>
<p>“Where is Perry’s Hotel?” we asked. One of the least busy of the
throng spared time to point to it with his thumb, as he passed us. In
some bewilderment we drew up in front of a large unfinished house,
through the many uncased apertures of which we could see only
scaffoldings, rough boards, carpenters’ benches, and heaps of shavings.
Streams of men were passing in and out through these openings, which
might be either doors or windows; no steps led to any of them.</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! oh, yes! can accommodate you all!” was the landlord’s reply
to our hesitating inquiries. He stood in the doorway of his dining-room;
the streams of men we had seen going in and out were the fed and the
unfed guests of the house. It was supper time; we also were hungry. We
peered into the dining room: three tables full of men; a huge pile of
beds on the floor, covered with hats and coats; a singular wall, made
entirely of doors propped upright; a triangular space walled off by
sailcloth,—this is what we saw. We stood outside, waiting among the
scaffolding and benches. A black man was lighting the candles in a
candelabrum made of two narrow bars of wood nailed across each other at
right angles, and perforated with holes. The candles sputtered, and the
hot fat fell on the shavings below.</p>
<p>“Dangerous way of lighting a room full of shavings,” some one said.
The landlord looked up at the swinging candelabra and laughed. “Tried it
pretty often,” he said. “Never burned a house down yet.”</p>
<p>I observed one peculiarity in the speech at Garland City. Personal
pronouns, as a rule, were omitted; there was no time for a superfluous
word.</p>
<p>“Took down this house at Wagon Creek,” he continued, “just one week
ago; took it down one morning while the people were eating breakfast;
took it down over their heads; putting it up again over their heads
now.”</p>
<p>This was literally true. The last part of it we ourselves were seeing
while he spoke, and a friend at our elbow had seen the Wagon Creek
crisis.</p>
<p>“Waiting for that round table for you,” said the landlord; “’ll bring
the chairs out here’s fast’s they quit ’em. That’s the only way to get
the table.”</p>
<p>So, watching his chances, as fast as a seat was vacated, he sprang
into the room, seized the chair and brought it out to us; and we sat
there in our “reserved seats,” biding the time when there should be room
enough vacant at the table for us to take our places.</p>
<p>What an indescribable scene it was! The strange-looking wall of
propped doors which we had seen, was the impromptu, wall separating the
bedrooms from the dining-room. Bedrooms? Yes, five of them; that is,
five bedsteads in a row, with just space enough between them to hang up
a sheet, and with just room enough between them and the propped doors
for a moderate-sized person to stand upright if he faced either the
doors or the bed. Chairs? Oh, no! What do you want of a chair in a
bedroom which has a bed in it? Washstands? One tin basin out in the
unfinished room. Towels? Uncertain.</p>
<p>The little triangular space walled off by the sailcloth was a sixth
bedroom, quite private and exclusive; and the big pile of beds on the
dining-room floor was to be made up into seven bedrooms more between the
tables, after everybody had finished supper.</p>
<p>Luckily for us we found a friend here,—a man who has been from the
beginning one of Colorado’s chief pioneers; and who is never, even in
the wildest wilderness, without resources of comfort.</p>
<p>“You can’t sleep here,” he said. “I can do better for you than
this.”</p>
<p>“Better!”</p>
<p>He offered us luxury. How movable a thing is one’s standard of
comfort! A two-roomed pine shanty, board walls, board floors, board
ceilings, board partitions not reaching to the roof, looked to us that
night like a palace. To have been entertained at Windsor Castle would
not have made us half so grateful.</p>
<p>It was late before the “city” grew quiet; and, long after most of the
lights were out, and most of the sounds had ceased, I heard one solitary
hammer in the distance, clink, clink, clink. I fell asleep listening to
it.</p>

<p>嘉伦市距嘉伦堡有六英里之遥。从此堡抄近路，在一片生长鼠尾草的高原上走3英里，就能到该市。这条路直如飞矢，远远看去，宛如灰白平原上划出的一条深褐色车辙，直入大山深处。嘉伦市方圆两百米内荒无人迹。在路上，你明知此城已不远，就四处张望它的踪影；然而眼前只有一座座丘陵突兀地横贯途中。城市在何方？就在你的足下，但你并未觉察。</p>
<p>日薄西山时，我们来到峡谷的边缘，这就是城市的所在地。这感觉就仿佛是浑然不知地站在断崖边上张望；峡谷大张巨口，就像是山体在我们脚下瞬间劈裂、分成两半。我们牢牢地把住车闸，小心翼翼沿陡峭的山路开着车；峡谷有光亮闪烁，崎岖的山路几乎要将白帐篷和车篷给震飞。再往深处，峡谷变宽，在圣路易斯公园一个入水口上展开。在其中段，这个拓宽的入口不远处，就躺着这座诞生十二天的城市。这时一种奇怪的喧闹声从城内传来。</p>
<p>“怎么回事？”我们惊问。“建造城市呢，”有人如是回答。“十二天前这儿还没有半屋片瓦。可今天一下出现了一百零五套房子，再过一周就会有两百多套；人人都在给自己建造家园，日夜不停地干活，都想让自己的房子比邻居家提前落成。现在有四家锯木厂连轴转地开工，结果最快也就能加工一半木材。一时间大家也就只能将就着用了。若不是这个原因，建成的房子应该是现在的两倍了。”</p>
<p>我们沿着峡谷继续行驶。路右侧一条小溪半掩半现于柳树丛林。成百上千个白帐篷在丛林里闪现：帐篷有杆子支撑，帆布直接在灌木丛上展开成蓬；于是出现了蘑菇帐篷、方块帐篷、大帐蓬小帐篷；每个帐篷旁边都点着篝火；许许多多白顶四轮马车静待晚上的使命，他们的帐篷主杆都凭借树枝支撑着，骡子和车夫有的躺有的站，围绕着帐篷形成一幅生动的画面。</p>
<p>这是一幅令人难忘的景象。随着“市”中心的接近，锤子组成的大合唱越来越高亢，喧闹声越来越杂乱。周围有庞大的公牛群组成的车队，拉着原木和木板摇摇晃晃；各式各样的车辆被铆足了劲地推着来回跑；有人扛来门板；有人就走来顺着窗框接住——这是种搬运木板的快捷省工的方法；有人铲土，有人就推着独轮车运送；没人闲站，没有人空手；每人都捡起物件，又跑步把东西放到别地方去，就像上演一部戏剧，大家各司其职；这“叮当！叮当！叮当！”声一直喧闹不已，将其他声音都压了下去，数以百计的锤子一齐敲打，真如上演一出“铁砧协奏曲”。</p>
<p>“请问斐瑞旅馆在什么地方？”我们大声问。人群中一个忙得没那么起劲的人从我们身边经过时，用大拇指指了一下。我们茫然地在一座尚未竣工的大房子前面停下，透过许多未及封抹的开口，我们仅能看到搭立的脚手架，粗糙的木板，木工长凳，成堆的刨花。人流不时从这些也许是门也许是窗的开口进进出出；这地方没有一个人驻足。</p>
<p>“哦哦，是的！是的！欢迎各位光临！”房东如此答复我们犹疑不定的询问。他正站在餐厅门口；我们身边进进出出的人流正是就餐完毕和来就餐的房客。那是晚饭时间；我们一个个也都饥肠辘辘了。于是我们朝餐厅打探了几眼：三张餐桌座无虚席；地板上好大一堆床，床上堆压着衣帽；有一面奇异的墙，竟全是用直竖的门板组成；一片犄角空间用帆布当墙围起来，这就是我们看到的一切。我们站在外面的脚手架和长板凳之间，耐心等待。一个黑人点亮了蜡烛，烛台是用两根狭长木条钉成的相互垂直的支架，上面穿了几个烛孔，蜡烛就插在孔内。烛花噼啪作响，热乎乎的烛油滴落在满地刨花上。</p>
<p>“屋里满地刨花，点灯很危险的。”有人警告。房东抬头看看枝形烛架上摇曳的灯火大笑。“经常这样，”他笑呵呵地说，“还从没烧过房子。”</p>
<p>我注意到嘉伦市人讲话的一个特点。人称代词一般都给省略掉了，好像人们忙得连多说一个词的时间都没有。</p>
<p>“在威格恩溪边拆掉了这种房子，”他继续说，“仅仅一周以前，一个早晨的时间就把它拆掉了，当时人们还吃着早饭呢；那时就在他们头顶上拆掉了；现在又在他们头顶上搭建起来了。”</p>
<p>这话一点不假。就在他说这话的当儿我们都看到还剩点尾巴，房子就竣工了，一位和我挨着的朋友就曾看到了那场“威格恩溪房子危机”。</p>
<p>“等会你们坐那张圆桌，”房东说，“等他们离开，我就立马给你们把椅子搬到这儿。只有这样你们才能占到饭桌。”</p>
<p>如此，他就两眼瞅着时机，刚有座位空出，他就一个箭步跳了过去，一把抓住椅子给我们搬了过来；我们坐上“预订座”，等候有腾出的足够空地让我们围桌就餐。</p>
<p>如此窘迫的场景真是难以用语言形容！以门支撑起来的墙样子古怪，就是这即兴而成的墙将餐厅和卧室两隔。卧室？哦，就这点空间要住五个人；也就是一排五个床架，床与床之间挂起1张床单就足以了，而且床与床之间仅有这点空，支撑的门板就够一个中等身高的人站直身子，站起身眼前不是门板就是床架。椅子么？哦，想都别想！您还指望在这样一间卧室摆张床再放得下椅子么？怎么洗脸呢？未完工的房子外面的一个锡罐头盒就充当脸盆了。毛巾么？说不准有没有。</p>
<p>那个用帆布围起来的犄角旮旯占去卧室的六分之一，是专属私人的空间；餐厅地板上的一大堆床，是准备大家晚餐结束后在餐桌之间隔成七间卧室用的。</p>
<p>我们很幸运在这儿找到了一位朋友，他是科罗拉多的开拓者之一；这个人就是在荒凉至极的野地，照样随遇而安。</p>
<p>“你们睡这儿失眠，”他乐呵呵地说，“我可以给你们更好一点的地方。”</p>
<p>“那敢情好！”</p>
<p>就这样，他给我们提供了一份奢侈享受。舒适的标准是因人而异的！一套两间房的松木棚屋，木板墙，木地板，木板顶棚，高度不到屋顶的木板隔间，依我们看来，那一晚不亚于入住皇宫宝殿。即便是得到入住温莎城堡这样的款待，我们亦远远没有这般感激。</p>
<p>这座“城市”安静之际，已是深夜。多数灯光都已熄灭了很久，喧闹的声响皆已静寂，唯有远处一个单调的锤音，叮当、叮当、叮当地传来，耳听着“叮当”不息，我却渐渐沉入了梦乡。</p>
<h2 id="lesson-102-2">LESSON 102</h2>
<p>IMPORTANCE OF THE UNION</p>
<p>联邦的重要性</p>
<p>Mr. President: I am conscious of having detained you and the Senate
much too long. I was drawn into the debate with no previous
deliberation, such as is suited to the discussion of so grave and
important a subject. But it is a subject of which my heart is full, and
I have not been willing to suppress the utterance of its spontaneous
sentiments. I can not, even now, persuade myself to relinquish it,
without expressing once more my deep conviction, that, since it respects
nothing less than the union of the states, it is of most vital and
essential importance to the public happiness.</p>
<p>I profess, sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept steadily in view
the prosperity and honor of the whole country, and the preservation of
our federal Union. It is to that Union we owe our safety at home, and
our consideration and dignity abroad. It is to that Union that we are
chiefly indebted for whatever makes us most proud of our country. That
Union we reached only by the discipline of our virtues, in the severe
school of adversity. It had its origin in the necessities of disordered
finance, prostrate commerce, and ruined credit. Under its benign
influences, these great interests immediately awoke, as from the dead,
and sprang forth with newness of life. Every year of its duration has
teemed with fresh proofs of its utility and its blessings; and, although
our territory has stretched out wider and wider, and our population
spread farther and farther, they have not outrun its protection or its
benefits. It has been to us all a copious fountain of national, social,
and personal happiness.</p>
<p>I have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the Union, to see what
might lie hidden in the dark recess behind. I have not coolly weighed
the chances of preserving liberty, when the bonds that unite us together
shall be broken asunder. I have not accustomed myself to hang over the
precipice of disunion, to see whether, with my short sight, I can fathom
the depth of the abyss below; nor could I regard him as a safe counselor
in the affairs of this government, whose thoughts should be mainly bent
on considering, not how the Union should be best preserved, but how
tolerable might be the condition of the people when it shall be broken
up and destroyed.</p>
<p>While the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying prospects
spread out before us, for us and our children. Beyond that, I seek not
to penetrate the veil. God grant that in my day, at least, that curtain
may not rise. God grant that on my vision never may be opened what lies
behind. When my eyes shall be turned to behold, for the last time, the
sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored
fragments of a once glorious Union; on States dissevered, discordant,
belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in
fraternal blood.</p>
<p>Let their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the gorgeous
ensign of the Republic, now known and honored throughout the earth,
still full high advanced, its arms and trophies streaming in their
original luster, not a stripe erased or polluted, not a single star
obscured—bearing for its motto no such miserable interrogatory as, What
is all this worth? nor those other words of delusion and folly, Liberty
first, and Union afterwards—but everywhere, spread all over in
characters of living light, blazing on all its ample folds, as they
float over the sea and over the land, and in every wind under the whole
heavens, that other sentiment, dear to every true American heart—Liberty
and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!</p>

<p>总统先生：我知道耽误了您和众议员的太多时间。因事先没有考虑成熟就卷入争论过于唐突，深怕不适于如此严肃重大的话题。然而这个论题在我心里酝酿已久，我一直不愿克制，欲一吐为快。即使是现在，我也没法说服自己放弃再次直抒胸臆的机会，那是因为，这个话题涉及的完全是州联邦，攸关民众幸福大计，非比寻常。</p>
<p>我在此宣告，先生，我的职业生涯迄今为止，无时不在考虑整个国家的繁荣和荣誉，并将保护联邦利益放在首位。正是因为有了联邦，我们才能在国内安居乐业，在国外赢得关心和尊重。正是多亏了联邦，我们才深以国家的诸多方面为傲。我们唯有凭借品德纪律，经历严峻考验和磨砺，才能使联邦达成和谐统一。在当初的财政混乱、商贸滑坡、信用坍塌之下，联邦政府应运而生。在联邦政府的良性作用下，经济开始复苏，死而复生焕发出崭新的生命。联邦政府一年年地充分证明了其功用和福佑；尽管我们的幅员越来越辽阔，人口散布越来越深远，但是他们无不在联邦的保护下获得联邦的福利。对我们每一个人来说，联邦无疑是国家、社会乃至个人幸福的丰富源泉。</p>
<p>先生，我一直不允许自己越过联邦，寻找其黑暗的背后可能隐藏的问题。就在把我们团结一起的盟约将化为一纸碎片的时刻，我不会冷静地考虑维护自由的可能性。我一直不适应将自己悬挂于联邦分裂的悬崖边沿，用我短浅的目光审视这个无底洞的深度；在政府的各项事务上，我也无法把这么一种人视为安全顾问——这种人所考虑的，不是联邦政府如何完善保全，而是当联邦分裂化为乌有的时候，人民的生活条件如何得过且过。</p>
<p>只要联邦继续存在，就有宏远壮阔的美好前景在我们面前，为我们和我们的孩子们展开。除此之外，我致力所求的不是刺穿那层帷幕。在我有生之日上帝至少承认，不可掀开那层幕布。在我的想象中，上帝从没允许敞开那个隐藏着重重危机的遮蔽物。当最后一次回眸凝望时，愿我不要看见那闪耀着天国之光的太阳，照在联邦政府那四分五裂、声名扫地的国土之上；照在那一个个分崩离析、互相争斗的州之上；照在一片充满仇恨、浸透了骨肉鲜血的土地之上。</p>
<p>权且让他们昏花留恋的眼神最后瞥一眼国旗吧，而不是让他们凝望那辉煌的，而今誉满世界，布满高天、迎风飘扬的共和国旗帜，它的武器和战利品依旧保持着本初的光泽，星条旗既没少条纹也没有受到玷污，同样没有一颗星光暗淡，也没有因为它的箴言受到悲惨的质问，这一切价值何在？先有自由，才有联邦，那非是虚妄的蠢话——这几个字的光辉无处不有，在星条旗帜的褶皱里闪耀，随旗帜飘扬于海空，迎风于大地，在浩浩苍穹中的每一缕微风里展耀，至于其他情感，对每颗真正的美国之心而言弥足珍贵——无论是现在还是将来，自由和联邦，统一不可分割！</p>

<p>THE INFLUENCES OF THE SUN</p>
<p>日光的影响力</p>
<p>John Tyndall, 1820-1893, one of the most celebrated modern
scientists, was an Irishman by birth. He was a pupil of the
distinguished Faraday. In 1853 he was appointed Professor of Natural
Philosophy in the Royal Institution of London. He is known chiefly for
his brilliant experiments and clear writing respecting heat, light, and
sound. He also wrote one or two interesting books concerning the Alps
and their glaciers. He visited America, and delighted the most
intelligent audiences by his scientific lectures and his brilliant
experiments. The scientific world is indebted to him for several
remarkable discoveries.</p>
<p>As surely as the force which moves a clock’s hands is derived from
the arm which winds up the clock, so surely is all terrestrial power
drawn from the sun. Leaving out of account the eruptions of volcanoes,
and the ebb and flow of the tides, every mechanical action on the
earth’s surface, every manifestation of power, organic and inorganic,
vital and physical, is produced by the sun. His warmth keeps the sea
liquid, and the atmosphere a gas, and all the storms which agitate both
are blown by the mechanical force of the sun. He lifts the rivers and
the glaciers up to the mountains; and thus the cataract and the
avalanche shoot with an energy derived immediately from him.</p>
<p>Thunder and lightning are also his transmitted strength. Every fire
that burns and every flame that glows, dispenses light and heat which
originally belonged to the sun. In these days, unhappily, the news of
battle is familiar to us, but every shock and every charge is an
application or misapplication of the mechanical force of the sun. He
blows the trumpet, he urges the projectile, he bursts the bomb. And,
remember, this is not poetry, but rigid mechanical truth.</p>
<p>He rears, as I have said, the whole vegetable world, and through it
the animal; the lilies of the field are his workmanship, the verdure of
the meadows, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. He forms the muscles,
he urges the blood, he builds the brain. His fleetness is in the lion’s
foot; he springs in the panther, he soars in the eagle, he slides in the
snake. He builds the forest and hews it down, the power which raised the
tree, and which wields the ax, being one and the same. The clover
sprouts and blossoms, and the scythe of the mower swings, by the
operation of the same force.</p>
<p>The sun digs the ore from our mines, he rolls the iron; he rivets the
plates, he boils the water; he draws the train. He not only grows the
cotton, but he spins the fiber and weaves the web. There is not a hammer
raised, a wheel turned, or a shuttle thrown, that is not raised, and
turned, and thrown by the sun.</p>
<p>His energy is poured freely into space, but our world is a halting
place where this energy is conditioned. Here the Proteus works his
spells; the selfsame essence takes a million shapes and hues, and
finally dissolves into its primitive and almost formless form. The sun
comes to us as heat; he quits us as heat; and between his entrance and
departure the multiform powers of our globe appear. They are all special
forms of solar power—the molds into which his strength is temporarily
poured in passing from its source through infinitude.</p>

<p>正如钟表转动的指针发力于给钟表上足发条的手臂，地球上的万物之能量无不来自太阳。太阳导致火山爆发，引起潮涨潮落，地球表面每一种机械活动，每一种能量的表现形式，精神的和物质的，无不是太阳所创造。太阳的热量保持海水呈液态，大气呈现气态；是太阳的机械力搅动气流，引发暴风骤雨。太阳将江河与冰川推上山顶，从而直接衍生了瀑布与雪崩景象。</p>
<p>雷电也是源于太阳传输能量。每一把燃烧的火苗、每一朵迸发的火焰，所散发的光和热最初是太阳所给。这段时间很不幸，战争消息频频传来，但是大家可想到，每次爆炸引发的地震和放电现象，均为应用或是错误应用了太阳机械能量而造成。日光吹响战争的喇叭，日光促发子弹弹射，日光将炸弹引爆。然而我们要记住，这不是浪漫的诗歌，而是严峻的力学事实。</p>
<p>正如我所言，是太阳养育了整个植物世界，且通过植物将能量传导给动物；旷野摇曳的百合花是光合作用的杰作，太阳的沐浴使草地绿意葱茏，漫山的牛群是日光喂养。日光能使肌肉强健，促进血液循环，构建大脑细胞。他奔走如狮，精力如豹，高翔如鹰，敏捷如蛇。他创造了深林又将深林推倒，其平地拔树、挥舞斧头的力量，威猛无比。发芽开花的苜蓿，刈草机旋转的镰刀，同样是日光的作用力。</p>
<p>太阳能从矿山里挖掘矿石，滚动铁块；他能铆钉木板，煮沸冰水；他拉着火车疾驶如飞。他不仅能种出如雪棉花，还能纺织编网。他没有举锤子、推车轮、传递织布梭子，但是这一切的运作力无一不是来自太阳。</p>
<p>阳光自由倾洒太空，但是我们的世界接收的能量是有限的。普罗透斯给地球施了魔法；本质相同的东西却变幻出无数形态，万般色相，最终又化于简单，甚而大化无形。太阳来时给我们光热，去时又带走，这一来一去之间，使得地球各种能量蕴蓄勃发。世间万般色相皆是日光的特殊形状——进入其中的模型，他的力量就通过无尽的能源临时倾注而成。</p>

<p>COLLOQUIAL POWERS OF FRANKLIN</p>
<p>富兰克林的话语感染力</p>
<p>William Wirt, 1772-1834, an American lawyer and author, was born at
Bladensburg, Maryland. Left an orphan at an early age, he was placed in
care of his uncle. He improved his opportunities for education so well
that he became a private tutor at fifteen. In 1792 he was admitted to
the bar, and began the practice of law in Virginia; he removed to
Richmond in 1799. From 1817 to 1829 he was Attorney-general of the
United States. His last years were spent in Baltimore. Mr. Wirt was the
author of several books; his “Letters of a British Spy,” published in
1803, and “Life of Patrick Henry,” published in 1817, are the best known
of his writings.</p>
<p>Never have I known such a fireside companion. Great as he was both as
a statesman and philosopher, he never shone in a light more winning than
when he was seen in a domestic circle. It was once my good fortune to
pass two or three weeks with him, at the house of a private gentleman,
in the back part of Pennsylvania, and we were confined to the house
during the whole of that time by the unintermitting constancy and depth
of the snows. But confinement never could be felt where Franklin was an
inmate; His cheerfulness and his colloquial powers spread around him a
perpetual spring.</p>
<p>When I speak, however, of his colloquial powers, I do not mean to
awaken any notion analogous to that which Boswell has given us of
Johnson. The conversation of the latter continually reminds one of the
“pomp and circumstance of glorious war.” It was, indeed, a perpetual
contest for victory, or an arbitrary or despotic exaction of homage to
his superior talents. It was strong, acute, prompt, splendid, and
vociferous; as loud, stormy, and sublime as those winds which he
represents as shaking the Hebrides, and rocking the old castle which
frowned on the dark-rolling sea beneath.</p>
<p>But one gets tired of storms, however sublime they may be, and longs
for the more orderly current of nature. Of Franklin, no one ever became
tired. There was no ambition of eloquence, no effort to shine in
anything which came from him. There was nothing which made any demand
upon either your allegiance or your admiration. His manner was as
unaffected as infancy. It was nature’s self. He talked like an old
patriarch; and his plainness and simplicity put you at once at your
ease, and gave you the full and free possession and use of your
faculties. His thoughts were of a character to shine by their own light,
without any adventitious aid. They only required a medium of vision like
his pure and simple style, to exhibit to the highest advantage their
native radiance and beauty.</p>
<p>His cheerfulness was unremitting. It seemed to be as much the effect
of a systematic and salutary exercise of the mind, as of its superior
organization. His wit was of the first order. It did not show itself
merely in occasional coruscations; but, without any effort or force on
his part, it shed a constant stream of the purest light over the whole
of his discourse. Whether in the company of commons or nobles, he was
always the same plain man; always most perfectly at his ease, with his
faculties in full play, and the full orbit of his genius forever clear
and unclouded.</p>
<p>And then, the stores of his mind were inexhaustible. He had commenced
life with an attention so vigilant that nothing had escaped his
observation; and a judgment so solid that every incident was turned to
advantage. His youth had not been wasted in idleness, nor overcast by
intemperance. He had been, all his life, a close and deep reader, as
well as thinker; and by the force of his own powers, had wrought up the
raw materials which he had gathered from books, with such exquisite
skill and felicity, that he has added a hundred fold to their original
value, and justly made them his own.</p>

<p>我从未遇到过这样一位可以围炉倾谈的伙伴。作为政治家和哲学家他都堪称伟大，他在国内的行为举止最为魅力十足。在返回宾夕法尼亚州的途中，因为天连降大雪，我曾有幸和他在一位绅士的私人宅邸共度了两三个星期。可是与富兰克林同住的日子毫无约束之感；他的乐天通达、机智雄辩的口才使他周围的人如沐春风。</p>
<p>然而我说到他的口才，并非叫人产生博斯威尔向我们描述约翰逊口才的联想。后者的谈话不断地让人想起辉煌战争的“盛况与境遇”。就胜利而言，那的确是一个永久的争论，对上级的才能是一种武断专制的敬意苛求。那是一种强烈而尖锐，敏捷、辉煌又大喊大叫的谈话，他的谈话响亮，激烈又极端，就像狂风，能摇撼赫布里群岛，能夷平海底的汹涌暗流。</p>
<p>但是无论这些谈话多么崇高，一个人会对这种暴风感到疲劳，而渴望更加有序自然的流露。但是和富兰克林交谈，人们始终感到轻松有趣。没有雄辩的野心，没有刻意显露可傲人的历史。他的态度犹如赤子的天真。那是他天性使然。他的语调宛如长者；其平易朴实立刻让你身心放松，给你一种完美自由的感觉，不觉中就激发了你的灵感。他的思想完全是由他自己的灯照亮，不受任何外界的影响。那些思想，一如他纯粹简单的风格，只需一个幻想的媒介，来展现思想本身的光辉和美丽，以彰显思想的优势。</p>
<p>于他，快乐不断。快乐好像是一套有系统、有益健康的精神体操，如生产快乐的工厂。其智慧首当其冲。它不仅仅是偶然闪现它本身的光辉，而是一种自然而然的流露，他的整个谈话中倾注着最纯粹的智慧，如溪流连绵不断。无论面前是一介布衣还是皇亲贵胄，他总是一样的平易近人，朴实无华；总是那般自在洒脱，安然适意，充满幽默，他的智慧永是表现得如此明朗清晰。</p>
<p>此外，他的思想宝库是取之不尽、用之不竭。他对生活保持着机警的洞察力；对事件的判断切中肯綮，能使败事扭转，化险为夷。他既不虚掷青春，也从不借酒浇愁；终其一生，手不释卷，既是读者也是思想者；他凭着自己天赋的专研精神，博览群书，吸取精华，用精致的技巧与成熟的思想将搜集的原材料加工，使浑金璞玉脱颖而出，放射光芒，从而转化成了他自己的知识价值。</p>

<p>THE DREAM OF CLARENCE</p>
<p>克拉伦斯的梦</p>
<p>SCENE—Room in the Tower of London. Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY
.</p>
<p>Brak. Why looks your grace so heavily to-day?</p>
<p>Clar . O, I have passed a miserable night,</p>
<p>So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,</p>
<p>That, as I am a Christian, faithful man,</p>
<p>I would not spend another such a night,</p>
<p>Though ’t were to buy a world of happy days,</p>
<p>So full of dismal terror was the time!</p>
<p>Brak. What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.</p>
<p>Clar. Methoughts, that I had broken from the Tower,</p>
<p>And was embarked to cross to Burgundy;</p>
<p>And, in my company, my brother Gloster;</p>
<p>Who, from my cabin, tempted me to walk</p>
<p>Upon the hatches; thence we looked toward England,</p>
<p>And cited up a thousand fearful times,</p>
<p>During the wars of York and Lancaster,</p>
<p>That had befallen us. As we paced along</p>
<p>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</p>
<p>Methought that Gloster stumbled; and, in falling,</p>
<p>Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,</p>
<p>Into the tumbling billows of the main.</p>
<p>Oh, then, methought, what pain it was to drown!</p>
<p>What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!</p>
<p>What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!</p>
<p>Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;</p>
<p>Ten thousand men that fishes gnawed upon;</p>
<p>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</p>
<p>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,</p>
<p>All scattered in the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Some lay in dead men’s skulls; and, in those holes</p>
<p>Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,</p>
<p>As ’t were in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,</p>
<p>Which wooed the slimy bottom of the deep,</p>
<p>And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.</p>
<p>Brak. Had you such leisure in the time of death,</p>
<p>To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?</p>
<p>Clar. Methought I had; and often did I strive</p>
<p>To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood</p>
<p>Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth</p>
<p>To seek the empty, vast, and wandering air;</p>
<p>But smothered it within my panting bulk,</p>
<p>Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.</p>
<p>Brak. Awaked you not with this sore agony?</p>
<p>Clar. Oh, no; my dream was lengthened after life;</p>
<p>Oh, then began the tempest to my soul,</p>
<p>Who passed, methought, the melancholy flood,</p>
<p>With that grim ferryman which poets write of,</p>
<p>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</p>
<p>The first that there did greet my stranger soul,</p>
<p>Was my great father-in-law, renowne’d Warwick;</p>
<p>Who cried aloud, “What scourge for perjury</p>
<p>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?”</p>
<p>And so he vanished. Then came wandering by</p>
<p>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair</p>
<p>Dabbled in blood; and he shrieked out aloud:</p>
<p>“Clarence is come! false, fleeting, perjured Clarence!</p>
<p>That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury:</p>
<p>Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!”</p>
<p>With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends</p>
<p>Environed me, and howled in mine ears</p>
<p>Such hideous cries, that, with the very noise,</p>
<p>I, trembling, waked, and, for a season after,</p>
<p>Could not believe but that I was in hell;</p>
<p>Such terrible impression made the dream.</p>
<p>Brak. No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;</p>
<p>I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.</p>
<p>Clar. O Brakenbury, I have done those things,</p>
<p>Which now bear evidence against my soul,</p>
<p>For Edward’s sake; and see how he requites me!</p>
<p>O God! if my deep prayers can not appease thee,</p>
<p>But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,</p>
<p>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone:</p>
<p>Oh, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!</p>
<p>—I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;</p>
<p>My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</p>
<p>Brak. I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!</p>
<p>CLARENCE reposes himself on a chair .</p>
<p>Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,</p>
<p>Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.</p>

<p>克拉伦斯 好像我是从塔楼逃脱；</p>
<p>上船欲将勃艮第河横渡；</p>
<p>我的兄弟克劳斯特相伴；</p>
<p>他引我出船舱，站在舱口；望着英格兰，</p>
<p>于是我们想起，约克郡与兰卡斯特交战时期，</p>
<p>经历的种种苦难。我们在船上踱步，</p>
<p>那摇晃的船令人晕眩，像无根的浮物，</p>
<p>眼看克劳斯特一步跌倒，</p>
<p>砸在我身，我欲相扶，却一头栽下船去</p>
<p>坠入巨浪，那浪潮狂翻大怒，</p>
<p>哦，我似乎就要溺水而亡，不堪其苦！</p>
<p>怪啸的浪声充斥双耳，</p>

<p>海底到处散落，</p>
<p>金条，巨锚，成堆的珍珠，</p>
<p>还有不可估价的奇石，无价的珠宝。</p>
<p>有的落进死人的头颅；空洞的</p>

<p>如对肉眼的轻蔑，反光的宝石，</p>
<p>向着虚伪的深渊调情媚妩，</p>
<p>嘲笑着寻宝人四分五裂的尸骨。</p>
<p>布莱肯 弥留之际哪有余闲，</p>
<p>让你将深渊的秘密窥探？</p>
<p>克拉伦斯 好像是有；我不断努力</p>
<p>要让幽灵屈服；</p>
<p>可嫉妒似洪水</p>
<p>仍旧在我灵魂里起伏，阻滞它</p>
<p>去探索空虚浩渺的天空；</p>
<p>遏阻于喘息不畅的体内，</p>
<p>灵魂，几乎就要在水中破窍而出。</p>
<p>布莱肯 这样苦痛的挣扎也没有将你惊醒？</p>
<p>克拉伦斯 哦，没有：生命已逝，梦却延续；</p>
<p>继而风暴席卷我的魂灵，</p>
<p>好像渡我过愁惨的幽冥河者</p>
<p>是诗歌里的船夫，冷酷的摆渡人，</p>
<p>送我来到永夜的国度。</p>

<p>说完就消失得无影无踪。接着漫步而来</p>
<p>一个天使般的影子，明晃晃的头发</p>

<p>“克拉伦斯来了！欺诈善变，背信的克拉伦斯！</p>
<p>在托克斯贝里的战场将我刺杀；</p>
<p>复仇女神，抓住他，给他狠狠惩罚！”</p>

<p>将我紧紧围住，鬼哭狼嚎，震耳发聩。</p>
<p>号哭如此恐怖，其声如此尖锐，</p>
<p>我浑身颤抖，梦醒许久</p>
<p>依然恍惚，以为身在地府。</p>
<p>如此可怕的梦景，仍历历在目。</p>
<p>布莱肯 大人，莫要惊慌！梦的确可怕；</p>
<p>听你说梦，我也浑身打怵。</p>
<p>克拉伦斯 哦，布莱肯波利，我干了恶事，</p>
<p>而今我的灵魂罪证难负，</p>
<p>为了国王爱德华的利益；看他却如何将我报复！</p>

<p>HOMEWARD BOUND</p>
<p>返航</p>
<p>Richard H. Dana, Jr., 1815-1882, was the son of Richard H. Dana, the
poet. He was born in Cambridge, Mass. In his boyhood be had a strong
desire to be a sailor, but by his father’s advice chose a student’s
life, and entered Harvard University. At the age of nineteen an
affection of the eyes compelled him to suspend his studies. He now made
a voyage to California as a common sailor, and was gone two years. On
his return, he resumed his studies and graduated in 1837. He afterwards
studied law, and entered upon an active and successful practice. Most of
his life was spent in law and politics, although he won distinction in
literature.</p>
<p>The following extract is from his “Two Years before the Mast,” a book
published in 1840, giving an account of his voyage to California. This
book details, in a most clear and entertaining manner, the everyday life
of a common sailor on shipboard, and is the best known of all Mr. Dana’s
works.</p>
<p>It is usual, in voyages round the Cape from the Pacific, to keep to
the eastward of the Falkland Islands; but, as there had now set in a
strong, steady, and clear southwester, with every prospect of its
lasting, and we had had enough of high latitudes, the captain determined
to stand immediately to the northward, running inside the Falkland
Islands. Accordingly, when the wheel was relieved at eight o’clock, the
order was given to keep her due north, and all hands were turned up to
square away the yards and make sail.</p>
<p>In a moment the news ran through the ship that the captain was
keeping her off, with her nose straight for Boston, and Cape Horn over
her taffrail. It was a moment of enthusiasm. Everyone was on the alert,
and even the two sick men turned out to lend a hand at the halyards. The
wind was now due southwest, and blowing a gale to which a vessel
close-hauled could have shown no more than a single close-reefed sail;
but as we were going before it, we could carry on. Accordingly, hands
were sent aloft and a reef shaken out of the topsails, and the reefed
foresail set. When we came to masthead the topsail yards, with all hands
at the halyards, we struck up, “Cheerly, men,” with a chorus which might
have been heard halfway to Staten Island.</p>
<p>Under her increased sail, the ship drove on through the water. Yet
she could bear it well; and the captain sang out from the
quarter-deck—“Another reef out of that fore topsail, and give it to
her.” Two hands sprang aloft; the frozen reef points and earings were
cast adrift, the halyards manned, and the sail gave out her increased
canvas to the gale. All hands were kept on deck to watch the effect of
the change. It was as much as she could well carry, and with a heavy sea
astern, it took two men at the wheel to steer her.</p>
<p>She flung the foam from her bows; the spray breaking aft as far as
the gangway. She was going at a prodigious rate. Still, everything held.
Preventer braces were reeved and hauled taut; tackles got upon the
backstays; and everything done to keep all snug and strong. The captain
walked the deck at a rapid stride, looked aloft at the sails, and then
to windward; the mate stood in the gangway, rubbing his hands, and
talking aloud to the ship—“Hurrah, old bucket! the Boston girls have got
hold of the towrope!” and the like; and we were on the forecastle
looking to see how the spars stood it, and guessing the rate at which
she was going,—when the captain called out—“Mr. Brown, get up the
topmast studding sail! What she can’t carry she may drag!”</p>
<p>The mate looked a moment; but he would let no one be before him in
daring. He sprang forward,—“Hurrah, men! rig out the topmast studding
sail boom! Lay aloft, and I’ll send the rigging up to you!” We sprang
aloft into the top; lowered a girtline down, by which we hauled up the
rigging; rove the tacks and halyards; ran out the boom and lashed it
fast, and sent down the lower halyards as a preventer. It was a clear
starlight night, cold and blowing; but everybody worked with a will.
Some, indeed, looked as though they thought the “old man” was mad, but
no one said a word.</p>
<p>We had had a new topmast studding sail made with a reef in it,—a
thing hardly ever heard of, and which the sailors had ridiculed a good
deal, saying that when it was time to reef a studding sail it was time
to take it in. But we found a use for it now; for, there being a reef in
the topsail, the studding sail could not be set without one in it also.
To be sure, a studding sail with reefed topsails was rather a novelty;
yet there was some reason in it, for if we carried that away, we should
lose only a sail and a boom; but a whole topsail might have carried away
the mast and all.</p>
<p>While we were aloft, the sail had been got out, bent to the yard,
reefed, and ready for hoisting. Waiting for a good opportunity, the
halyards were manned and the yard hoisted fairly up to the block; but
when the mate came to shake the cat’s-paw out of the downhaul, and we
began to boom end the sail, it shook the ship to her center. The boom
buckled up and bent like a whipstick, and we looked every moment to see
something go; but, being of the short, tough upland spruce, it bent like
whalebone, and nothing could break it. The carpenter said it was the
best stick he had ever seen.</p>
<p>The strength of all hands soon brought the tack to the boom end, and
the sheet was trimmed down, and the preventer and the weather brace
hauled taut to take off the strain. Every rope-yarn seemed stretched to
the utmost, and every thread of canvas; and with this sail added to her,
the ship sprang through the water like a thing possessed. The sail being
nearly all forward, it lifted her out of the water, and she seemed
actually to jump from sea to sea. From the time her keel was laid, she
had never been so driven; and had it been life or death with everyone of
us, she could not have borne another stitch of canvas.</p>
<p>Finding that she would bear the sail, the hands we’re sent below, and
our watch remained on deck. Two men at the wheel had as much as they
could do to keep her within three points of her course, for she steered
as wild as a young colt. The mate walked the deck, looking at the sails,
and then over the side to see the foam fly by her,—slapping his hands
upon his thighs and talking to the ship—“Hurrah, you jade, you’ve got
the scent! you know where you’re going!” And when she leaped over the
seas, and almost out of the water, and trembled to her very keel, the
spars and masts snapping and creaking, “There she goes!—There she
goes—handsomely!—As long as she cracks, she holds!”—while we stood with
the rigging laid down fair for letting go, and ready to take in sail and
clear away if anything went.</p>
<p>At four bells we have the log, and she was going eleven knots fairly;
and had it not been for the sea from aft which sent the chip home, and
threw her continually off her course, the log would have shown her to
have been going somewhat faster. I went to the wheel with a young fellow
from the Kennebec, who was a good helmsman; and for two hours we had our
hands full. A few minutes showed us that our monkey jackets must come
off; and, cold as it was, we stood in our shirt sleeves in a
perspiration, and were glad enough to have it eight bells and the wheels
relieved. We turned in and slept as well as we could, though the sea
made a constant roar under her bows, and washed over the forecastle like
a small cataract.</p>

<p>一般情况下，从太平洋起航绕道好望角，要经过福兰克群岛的东部；但是由于现在刮起一场清冽的大风，风速不减，风势强劲，我们的船所处的纬度已经足够高，于是船长决定立刻向北航行，进入福兰克群岛。因此，八点钟舵轮换岗，船长下令保持向北的航向，此时所有船员一齐动手迎风扬帆，开始起航。</p>
<p>船长正在将船绕开好望角，船头直指波士顿方向，这一消息瞬间传遍整艘船。这是个群情激动的时刻。人人都十分警惕，就连那两个生病的水手也来帮忙拉吊索。不出所料，西南风吹起，狂风大作，迎风航船的船帆紧缩；但是我们依然能顶风继续前进。于是我们双手高举着去够一个脱落了顶帆的缩帆，并把收缩的前帆张开。当我们双手拉起吊索，将顶帆的帆桁升至桅顶时，大家纵情高歌着《欢唱吧：伙计们》，这声浪估计在去斯塔恩岛的中途都能听到。</p>
<p>随着船帆升高，这艘船在水上继续航行。船的承受力仍旧很好；船长从甲板上大声喊道：“顶帆前头又出现暗礁，绕开它。”说着，他边把两只手高高举起；冰冻的暗礁尖峭突立，横帆角上的耳索漂浮起来了，升降索被牢牢操控着，增加了船帆的帆桁迎风展开。所有人都在甲板上观察行船的变化效果。行船荷重极大，阴沉的海水涌向船尾，船尾需要两个人来操纵轮子。</p>
<p>船头迎风破浪；船尾激起的浪花远远地喷溅到了舷梯上。船正以惊人的时速前进。但是我们把一切都掌控良好。辅助转帆索上穿过了钢绳，然后拽紧；滑轮拉着后支索；使绳索绷紧保持强劲。船长大步走上甲板查看，仰头望望船帆，又迎头朝着风向；站在舷梯上的大副搓着双手，朝轮船大喊：“好哇，老爷车！波士顿的姑娘们已经抓住你的缆绳喽！”大副喊叫的时候，我们在前甲板上正望着帆桅杆查看竖立情况，猜测着船行进的时速，这时船长大喊：“布朗先生，你上中桅翼帆！翼帆松动，船很吃力，可能支持不住！”</p>
<p>大副望了片刻中桅；不过他不会让别人抢在他前面行动。只见他纵身一跃，喊道：“好哇，伙计们！我们给中桅翼帆装上吊杆！把帆索固定在高处，我这就把绳索投给你们！”我们一窝蜂爬上中桅；将桅顶吊索放低，好借吊索将缆绳拉上去；然后将缆绳穿过绞辘和升降索，缠满吊杆，快速将它扎捆；然后将升降索放低作为辅助索。这是个星光灿烂的夜，清冽的冷风阵阵吹来；但是大家齐心协力地干着。有人看起来的确觉着大副这个“老家伙”疯狂了，但没人发一句牢骚。</p>
<p>我们有了一个新的中桅翼帆，内里装有一个缩帆——这妙策几乎从未听闻，海员都拿来当笑料，说收翼帆的时候就是装缩帆的时机。但我们现在正好给它派上了用场；因为上桅帆里有缩帆的话，副翼帆就不必加缩帆了。诚然，给带有缩帆的上桅帆装上翼帆还是个非常罕见的新奇例子；个中还有些机巧，就是上桅帆一旦不受控制，我们失去的只是一个船帆和吊杆；而整个上桅帆却可能折断桅杆，甚而使整艘船失控。</p>
<p>就在我们还处于半空的中桅上时，船帆已经张开，朝着帆桁弯曲，准备升起。海员操纵升降索，帆桁恰好升到阻塞处，等待着良好时机。但是大副开始将猫爪工具从落帆索抖出来、我们开始急速收帆时，船帆将船已经摇到了水中央。吊杆向上扣紧像个弯曲的鞭杆，这时我们眼也不眨，以为它会破裂飞迸；但是它是用坚硬的高地云杉所造，如今像鲸须般弓曲着，没什么东西能将其压断。木匠说这可是他所见过的木质最好的杆子。</p>
<p>大家齐心协力，很快将帆桁升平，帆索变细了，辅助索和气象仪支柱紧紧缠绕，紧拉到了要断的地步。每一根绳索的拉力似乎都发挥到了极限，帆布的每一根线都紧绷到极点；而有了增加的这张帆，船身像着了魔似的一下蹿出水面。船帆几乎一律向前，将船身托离了水面，实际上她就像是从一片海浪跳到另一片海浪。从龙骨被放倒的那一刻起，她就从未曾如此极速地横冲直闯；生死攸关我们每一个人，这艘船再也承受不起船帆被风撕裂的后果了。</p>
<p>看到船能支撑船帆，船长派我们到下面去帮忙，而我们仍留意观察着甲板的情况。掌舵的两个人尽可能让船在航线内行驶，因为这艘船就像个初生的牛犊一样莽撞，难以驾驭。大副走上甲板，望望船帆然后又看向船侧飞溅的水花，突然两手拍着大腿朝着轮船大叫起来：“好哇，你这匹老马，你闻到草料味了吧！你知道你现在去哪儿！”就在轮船踏着海浪几乎脱离水面跳跃前行的时刻，龙骨剧烈震颤，帆横杆和桅杆噼噼啪啪吱吱嘎嘎响起了，“好了！好了！干得漂亮！只要她有响动，就是挺住了！”我们拿起搁在甲板上的索具，将它放开，准备收帆，清除可能出现的问题。</p>
<p>四声钟声敲响时我们看测程仪，轮船正以十一节的时速稳速前进；若不是船尾的海水老是把测程器的木板推离航向，测出来的船速还要高一些。我和一位年轻的同伴走到舵轮跟前，这个同伴家住肯纳贝克河畔，是位很棒的舵手；我们在舵轮前手不停闲地忙活了两个小时。有几分钟我们不得不将水手紧身短上衣脱掉；尽管冷气袭来，我们却挽着汗津津的衬衫袖子站在那儿，八声钟鸣鸣响，舵轮恢复了正常运作，让我们心情畅快。我们转身进舱尽可能地美美睡上一觉。而海浪在船头下面不停咆哮号叫，像小小瀑布一般不断地冲刷着前甲板。</p>

<p>IMPEACHMENT OF WARREN HASTINGS</p>
<p>控告沃伦·哈斯廷斯</p>
<p>Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1800-1859, was born in the village of
Rothley, Leicestershire. On his father’s side, he descended from Scotch
Highlanders and ministers of the kirk. His education began at home, and
was completed at Trinity College, Cambridge. While a student, he gained
much reputation as a writer and a debater. In 1826 he was admitted to
the bar. In 1825 began his connection with the “Edinburgh Review,” which
continued twenty years. Some of his most brilliant essays appeared first
in its pages. He was first chosen to Parliament in 1830, and was
reelected several times. In 1840 his essays and some other writings were
collected and published with the title of “Miscellanies.” His “Lays of
Ancient Rome” was published in 1842. His “History of England” was
published near the close of his life. In 1857 he was given the title of
Baron Macaulay. “His style is vigorous, rapid in its movement, and
brilliant; and yet, with all its splendor, has a crystalline clearness.
Indeed, the fault generally found with his style is, that it is so
constantly brilliant that the vision is dazzled and wearied with its
excessive brightness.” He has sometimes been charged with sacrificing
facts to fine sentences.</p>
<p>In his statesmanship, Macaulay was always an earnest defender of
liberty. His first speech in Parliament was in support of a bill to
remove the civil disabilities of the Jews, and his whole parliamentary
career was consistent with this wise and liberal beginning.</p>
<p>The place in which the impeachment of Warren Hastings was conducted,
was worthy of such a trial. It was the great hall of William Rufus; the
hall which had resounded with acclamations at the inauguration of thirty
kings; the hall which had witnessed the just sentence of Bacon, and the
just absolution of Somers; the hall where the eloquence of Strafford had
for a moment awed and melted a victorious party inflamed with just
resentment; the hall where Charles had confronted the High Court of
Justice with the placid courage which half redeemed his fame.</p>
<p>Neither military nor civil pomp was wanting. The avenues were lined
with grenadiers. The streets were kept clear by cavalry. The peers,
robed in gold and ermine, were marshaled by heralds. The judges, in
their vestments of state, attended to give advice on points of law. The
long galleries were crowded by such an audience as has rarely excited
the fears or the emulation of an orator. There were gathered together,
from all parts of a great, free, enlightened, and prosperous realm,
grace and female loveliness, wit and learning, the representatives of
every science and of every art.</p>
<p>There were seated around the queen, the fair-haired, young daughters
of the house of Brunswick. There the embassadors of great kings and
commonwealths gazed with admiration on a spectacle which no other
country in the world could present. There Siddons, in the prime of her
majestic beauty, looked with emotion on a scene surpassing all the
imitations of the stage. There Gibbon, the historian of the Roman
Empire, thought of the days when Cicero pleaded the cause of Sicily
against Verres; and when, before a senate which had still some show of
freedom, Tacitus thundered against the oppressor of Africa. There, too,
were seen, side by side, the greatest painter and the greatest scholar
of the age; for the spectacle had allured Reynolds from his easel and
Parr from his study.</p>
<p>The sergeants made proclamation. Hastings advanced to the bar, and
bent his knee. The culprit was indeed not unworthy of that great
presence. He had ruled an extensive and populous country; had made laws
and treaties; had sent forth armies; had set up and pulled down princes;
and in his high place he had so borne himself, that all had feared him,
that most had loved him, and that hatred itself could deny him no title
to glory, except virtue. A person, small and emaciated, yet deriving
dignity from a carriage which, while it indicated deference to the
court, indicated, also, habitual self-possession and self-respect; a
high and intellectual forehead; a brow, pensive, but not gloomy; a mouth
of inflexible decision; a face, pale and worn, but serene, on which a
great and well-balanced mind was legibly written: such was the aspect
with which the great proconsul presented himself to his judges.</p>
<p>The charges, and the answers of Hastings, were first read. This
ceremony occupied two whole days. On the third, Burke rose. Four
sittings of the court were occupied by his opening speech, which was
intended to be a general introduction to all the charges. With an
exuberance of thought and a splendor of diction, which more than
satisfied the highly raised expectations of the audience, he described
the character and institutions of the natives of India; recounted the
circumstances in which the Asiatic Empire of Britain had originated; and
set forth the constitution of the Company and of the English
Presidencies.</p>
<p>Having thus attempted to communicate to his hearers an idea of
eastern society, as vivid as that which existed in his own mind, he
proceeded to arraign the administration of Hastings, as systematically
conducted in defiance of morality and public law. The energy and pathos
of the great orator extorted expressions of unwonted admiration from
all; and, for a moment, seemed to pierce even the resolute heart of the
defendant. The ladies in the galleries, unaccustomed to such displays of
eloquence, excited by the solemnity of the occasion, and perhaps not
unwilling to display their taste and sensibility, were in a state of
uncontrollable emotion. Handkerchiefs were pulled out; smelling bottles
were handed round; hysterical sobs and screams were heard, and some were
even carried out in fits.</p>
<p>At length the orator concluded. Raising his voice, till the old
arches of Irish oak resounded—“Therefore,” said he, “hath it with all
confidence been ordered by the Commons of Great Britain, that I impeach
Warren Hastings of high crimes and misdemeanors. I impeach him in the
name of the Commons House of Parliament, whose trust he has betrayed. I
impeach him in the name of the English nation, whose ancient honor he
has sullied. I impeach him in the name of the people of India, whose
rights he has trodden under foot, and whose country he has turned into a
desert. Lastly, in the name of human nature itself, in the name of both
sexes, in the name of every age, in the name of every rank, I impeach
the common enemy and oppressor of all.”</p>

<p>控告沃伦·哈斯廷斯的地点真配得上这一场审讯，那是个古老庄严的王家礼堂。乃威廉二世所建；这座礼堂里回荡着三十位国王加冕时的欢呼声；礼堂见证了对培根的合理宣判，目睹了对萨默斯公平的赦免；就是在这礼堂里，斯特拉福德的滔滔宏辩瞬间赢得满堂敬畏，化解了一个得胜党的积怨；也是在这个大礼堂，查尔斯面对高级法官，沉着冷静应对，给他自己挽回了一半声誉。</p>
<p>现在军事演练常见，民间隆重仪式不缺。此刻林荫大道士兵排列，条条街道被骑兵肃清。穿着金色貂皮大衣的达官贵族由传令官编队汇集。身着朝服的法官上前就几点法律给予忠告。而长长的走廊观众摩肩接踵，这阵势激起了人们的惊慌，纷纷效法演说家慷慨陈词。从伟大自由、文明昌盛的王国的各个地方汇聚而来的，有优雅美丽的女人、满腹才学的智者，还有科学界和艺术界的精英。</p>
<p>围绕女王而坐的那些金发少女是布伦瑞克家族的女孩儿们。伟大的君王所派出的使节和代表联邦共和国的大使们凝视着这壮观之景，惊叹世界上没有第二个国家能有如此场面。你瞧正值华年、庄严美丽的西登斯，动情地看着眼前这胜过所有舞台模仿的一幕。那儿站着吉本，这位罗马帝国历史学家，正思考着西塞罗为西思莉反抗威勒斯统治而辩护的那段岁月；当时古罗马元老院还有一些自由表达权，塔西佗曾指着非洲暴君大声怒斥。你还能看见当代两位最伟大的画家与学者——雷诺兹与帕尔并肩站立，盛大的活动吸引着两人，一个离开了画室，一个走出了书房。</p>
<p>士官发出一声通告。哈斯廷斯走上被告席，并朝观众席鞠了一躬。这个犯人的确值得这样郑重其事地接受审讯。他曾统治一个地域辽阔、人口众多的国家；他曾制定律法、签过条约；他曾对外调兵遣将；他曾立过王储、废黜亲王；他立下威严、高高居上，以至于所有人对他心生畏惧，但他亦赢得了绝大部分人的爱戴，对他的嫉恨也无法使他的辉煌成就失色——只有品德除外。这个瘦小虚弱的人，却在对法庭的顺从以及惯常的沉着和自尊之中，令举手投足间散发出一种高贵的风度；其突出的前额带着智慧；额蹙忧愁但不沮丧；双唇的曲线折射出百折不挠的个性；这张脸苍白疲倦，但是很平静，脸上透露出强健的心理素质；这位叱咤风云的地方总督就以这样面貌将自己呈交给了法官。</p>
<p>法庭首先宣读了对于哈斯廷斯的指控及其答复。这个仪式整整进行了两天。第三天，伯克起身发言。他的公开演讲本来是要概述所有指控，却占去了四场会议时间。他的思维极其活跃，措辞极尽华丽，尽管观众原本就对他期望甚高，他的表现还是让大家充满惊喜。他描述了印度土著人的个性和习俗；叙述了大不列颠的亚洲帝国起源情形；详细阐明了东印度公司的章程和英政府管理期限。</p>
<p>伯克意在将鲜活地存在自己心中的东方社会之景象传达给观众，他继续慷慨陈词，指控哈斯廷斯管理失当，频频做出无视道德践踏公众法律的行为。这位伟大演讲者激情四射，措辞哀婉动人，令所有人激赏不已；有一刻，他的演讲甚至仿佛刺穿了被告人的铁石心肠。走廊上的女士们，极不适应如此雄辩演讲，被这场面的庄严所刺激，她们也许不愿表露自己的品味和情趣，但是又克制不住失控的情绪。于是手帕掏出来了，嗅盐瓶在女人们的手中被传来递去，歇斯底里的哭泣和尖叫传来，有的女人甚至激动得前仰后合。</p>
<p>这位演说者终于做出结论。他高抬嗓门，就连爱尔兰橡木制作的老旧拱门都回荡起他的声音。“因此，”他说，“我对大不列颠国会下院下令对哈斯廷斯进行控告信心十足，我检举沃伦·哈斯廷斯的倒行逆施与品行不端。我以国会下院的名义控告他出卖了国家的信任。我以英国的名义控告他玷污了这个古老国家的荣誉。我以印度人民的名义控告他践踏了他们的权利，将他们的国家变成了荒芜的沙漠。最后，我以人性本身的名义，以两性的名义，以众生的名义，以各个阶级的名义，控告这个人民的公敌和压迫者。”</p>

<p>DESTRUCTION OF THE CARNATIC</p>
<p>卡纳提克的毁灭</p>
<p>Edmund Burke, 1730-1797, one of the most able and brilliant of
England’s essayists, orators, and statesmen, was born in Dublin, and was
the son of an able lawyer. He graduated at Trinity College, Dublin, in
1748. As a student, he was distinguished for ability and industry. From
1750 to 1766 he was in London writing for periodicals, publishing books,
or serving as private secretary. His work on “The Sublime and Beautiful”
appeared in 1756. From 1766 to 1794 he was a member of Parliament,
representing at different times different constituencies. On the first
day of his appearance in the House of Commons he made a successful
speech. “In the three principal questions which excited his interest,
and called forth the most splendid displays of his eloquence—the contest
with the American Colonies, the impeachment of Warren Hastings, and the
French Revolution—we see displayed a philanthropy the most pure,
illustrated by a genius the most resplendent.” Mr. Burke’s foresight,
uprightness, integrity, learning, magnanimity, and eloquence made him
one of the most conspicuous men of his time; and his writings stand
among the noblest contributions to English literature.</p>
<p>When at length Hyder Ali found that he had to do with men who either
would sign no convention, or whom no treaty and no signature could bind,
and who were the determined enemies of human intercourse itself, he
decreed to make the country possessed by these incorrigible and
predestinated criminals a memorable example to mankind. He resolved, in
the gloomy recesses of a mind capacious of such things, to leave the
whole Carnatic an everlasting monument of vengeance, and to put
perpetual desolation as a barrier between him and those against whom the
faith which holds the moral elements of the world together was no
protection.</p>
<p>He became at length so confident of his force, so collected in his
might, that he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful resolution.
Having terminated his disputes with every enemy and every rival, who
buried their mutual animosities in their common detestation against the
creditors of the Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every quarter whatever a
savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments in the arts of
destruction; and compounding all the materials of fury, havoc, and
desolation into one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities
of the mountains.</p>
<p>Whilst the authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing
on this menacing meteor which blackened all their horizon, it suddenly
burst, and poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the
Carnatic.</p>
<p>Then ensued a scene of woe, the like of which no eye had seen, no
heart conceived, and which no tongue can adequately tell. All the
horrors of war before known or heard of, were mercy to that new havoc. A
storm of universal fire blasted every field, consumed every house,
destroyed every temple. The miserable inhabitants, flying from their
flaming villages, in part were slaughtered; others, without regard to
sex, to age, to the respect of rank, or sacredness of function,—fathers
torn from children, husbands from wives, enveloped in a whirlwind of
cavalry, and, amidst the goading spears of drivers, and the trampling of
pursuing horses,—were swept into captivity, in an unknown and hostile
land.</p>
<p>Those who were able to evade this tempest, fled to the walled cities;
but escaping from fire, sword, and exile, they fell into the jaws of
famine. The alms of the settlement of Madras, in this dreadful exigency,
were certainly liberal, and all was done by charity that private charity
could do; but it was a people in beggary; it was a nation which
stretched out its hands for food.</p>
<p>For months together these creatures of sufferance, whose very excess
and luxury in their most plenteous days had fallen short of the
allowance of our austerest fasts, silent, patient, resigned, without
sedition or disturbance, almost without complaint, perished by a hundred
a day in the streets of Madras; every day seventy at least laid their
bodies in the streets, or on the glacis of Tanjore, and expired of
famine in the granary of India.</p>
<p>I was going to wake your justice toward this unhappy part of our
fellow-citizens, by bringing before you some of the circumstances of
this plague of hunger. Of all the calamities which beset and waylay the
life of man, this comes the nearest to our heart, and is that wherein
the proudest of us all feels himself to be nothing more than he is.</p>
<p>But I find myself unable to manage it with decorum. These details are
of a species of horror so nauseous and disgusting; they are so degrading
to the sufferers and to the hearers; they are so humiliating to human
nature itself, that, on better thoughts, I find it more advisable to
throw a pall over this hideous object, and to leave it to your general
conceptions.</p>
<p>For eighteen months, without intermission, this destruction raged
from the gates of Madras to the gates of Tanjore; and so completely did
these masters in their art, Hyder Ali, and his more ferocious son,
absolve themselves of their impious vow, that when the British armies
traversed, as they did, the Carnatic, for hundreds of miles in all
directions, through the whole line of their march they did not see one
man—not one woman—not one child—not one four-footed beast of any
description whatever! One dead, uniform silence reigned over the whole
region.</p>
<p>With the inconsiderable exceptions of the narrow vicinage of some few
forts, I wish to be understood as speaking literally;—I mean to produce
to you more than three witnesses, who will support this assertion in its
full extent. That hurricane of war passed through every part of the
central provinces of the Carnatic. Six or seven districts to the north
and to the south (and these not wholly untouched) escaped the general
ravage.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-555">中文阅读</h4>
<p>哈德·阿里最后感到他不得不和那些人打交道了——没有任何条约能约束那些人，他们好像生来就是人类交流的大敌；此时，对于这个被这样一群不可救赎、命中注定的罪犯所把持的国家，他下令要使其成为一个人类终生难忘的教训。他那容纳了如此罪恶之景的黑暗内心，已经决定要给整个卡纳提克留下无穷尽的复仇冤魂，让永恒的荒芜，在他和那些违背信仰、坚信世界的基本道德元素无需保护的人们之间，竖起一道永恒的屏障。</p>
<p>他终于对自己的魄力和威力信心十足，变得镇定从容，无论何等可怕的决心，都能公之于众。他终止了和每个敌人、每个对手的争论，这些人暂时隐藏了对彼此的仇恨，同仇敌忾地对抗阿科特的地方长官。他从心中的每个角落召唤出所有可能给他毁灭的艺术带来灵感的残酷暴行；他在悬崖峭壁间徘徊，让所有狂暴、浩劫与荒芜的素材聚拢成一团。</p>
<p>所有这些罪恶的始作俑者正懒散而无知地盯着这颗不祥的流星闯入他们视野，此时它突然爆炸了，所有威力一股脑倾注到卡纳提克无垠的大地上。</p>
<p>一幅悲惨的场景随之呈现，这种场面真是见所未见、想所未想，没有人能用语言恰当地描述出来。人们之前了解听说的所有恐怖战争场面，较之这场新的浩劫都是幸运的。一场风暴卷着漫天大火，在每片土地上肆虐，摧毁民房，烧塌寺庙。村民悲惨地从火舌舔舐的村庄里飞逃而出，部分人葬身火海；而那些逃生的人，无论男女老少、尊卑贵贱，父亲们都因失去娇儿而恸哭，丈夫们亦因失去爱妻而落泪，旋风般飞奔而至的骑兵将他们包围，挥舞长矛将他们驱赶，疾追的战马将他们踩踏，把他们囚禁到陌生而敌对的土地之上。</p>
<p>那些侥幸逃脱了这场风暴的人逃往一座座围城；但是他们逃出了烈火、避开了刀剑、摆脱了流放之苦，却陷入了饥馑的咽喉。在这可怕的紧急关头，马达拉斯殖民的捐献物自然是慷慨的；慈善所能做到的都做到了；但那个民族，是赤贫的民族；国家，是伸着手乞讨的国家。</p>
<p>接下来的数月，这些受苦受难的生灵，这些物质丰足时曾奢侈无度的人，陷入了匮乏之中，食物就连我们清苦斋戒时都不如。他们沉默忍耐，逆来顺受，既没有骚乱四起，也没有群情暴动，几乎连一声抱怨都没有。一天之内，马达拉斯的大街饿殍遍地；坦贾武尔的大街上、斜堤上每天至少有70具尸首横陈，而在号称印度粮仓的地区，大批人就这样活活饿死。</p>
<p>我之所以将这些饥馑瘟疫的情形告诉你们，意在希望那些同为英王子民的不幸遭遇，能唤醒你们的正义之心，得到你们的公平对待。围攻伏击人类生命的所有灾害，就发生在离我们心灵最近的地方，而我们所有人的内心引以为傲的就是感同身受。</p>
<p>但是，我发现我无法做到措辞文明了。这些景象如此令人惊怖、使人作呕；使那些受难者及听众感到丢脸；使人类的本性蒙羞。我发现好点的想法，莫过于明智地将一片遮挡物遮住这丑恶的事物，只让你们留有一个大概的认知。</p>
<p>毁灭性的灾难在接下来的十八个月蔓延，从马达拉斯城门一直肆虐到坦贾武尔的城门，这些灾难大师们彻底发挥了他们的毁灭性艺术。哈德·阿里和他那个残忍的儿子，以他们毫无诚信可言的誓约为他们的罪行开脱，当大英帝国的军队开进来的时候，正如他们的毒咒，卡纳提克方圆几百英里，在一路行军中人迹罕见、野兽灭踪，这种惨绝人寰的景象难以描述！一团死亡的、无声的寂静笼罩着整个卡纳提克地区。</p>
<p>一些新建要塞附近的区域幸免浩劫，可是微小得不足为道，我希望我的理解如实所述。我的意思是至少有3个目击证人，他们将用亲临其境的实况为这一断言佐证。战争之风暴横扫卡纳提克地区的每个角落。对于南北地区来说，只有六七个小地方（这几个地方并不是完全未受战争影响）逃脱了横扫卡纳提克的灭绝性灾难。</p>

<p>THE RAVEN</p>
<p>乌鸦</p>
<p>Edgar Allan Poe, 1809-1849, was born in Boston, and died in
Baltimore. He was left a destitute orphan at an early age, and was
adopted by Mr. John Allan, a wealthy citizen of Richmond. He entered the
University of Virginia, at Charlottesville, where he excelled in his
studies, and was always at the head of his class; but he was compelled
to leave on account of irregularities. He was afterwards appointed a
cadet at West Point, but failed to graduate there for the same reason.
Poe now quarreled with his benefactor and left his house never to
return. During the rest of his melancholy career, he obtained a
precarious livelihood by different literary enterprises. His ability as
a writer gained him positions with various periodicals in Richmond, New
York, and Philadelphia, and during this time he wrote some of his finest
prose. The appearance of “The Raven” in 1845, however, at once made Poe
a literary lion. He was quite successful for a time, but then fell back
into his dissipated habits which finally caused his death. In his
personal appearance, Poe was neat and gentlemanly; his face was
expressive of intellect and sensibility; and his mental powers in some
directions were of a high order. His writings show care, and a great
degree of skill in their construction; but their effect is generally
morbid.</p>
<p>Once upon a midnight dreary,</p>
<p>While I pondered, weak and weary,</p>
<p>Over many a quaint and curious</p>
<p>Volume of forgotten lore—</p>
<p>While I nodded, nearly napping,</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a tapping,</p>
<p>As of some one gently rapping,</p>
<p>Rapping at my chamber door.</p>
<p>“’t is some visitor,” I muttered,</p>
<p>“Tapping at my chamber door</p>
<p>Only this, and nothing more.”</p>
<p>Ah, distinctly I remember,</p>
<p>It was in the bleak December,</p>
<p>And each separate dying ember</p>
<p>Wrought its ghost upon the floor.</p>
<p>Eagerly I wished the morrow;</p>
<p>Vainly I had sought to borrow</p>
<p>From my books surcease of sorrow</p>
<p>Sorrow for the lost Lenore—</p>
<p>For the rare and radiant maiden</p>
<p>Whom the angels name Lenore—</p>
<p>Nameless here for evermore.</p>
<p>And the silken, sad, uncertain</p>
<p>Rustling of each purple curtain</p>
<p>Thrilled me,—filled me with fantastic</p>
<p>Terrors, never felt before;</p>
<p>So that now, to still the beating</p>
<p>Of my heart, I stood repeating,</p>
<p>“’t is some visitor entreating</p>
<p>Entrance at my chamber door</p>
<p>Some late visitor entreating</p>
<p>Entrance at my chamber door;</p>
<p>This it is, and nothing more.”</p>
<p>Presently my soul grew stronger;</p>
<p>Hesitating then no longer,</p>
<p>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly</p>
<p>Your forgiveness I implore;</p>
<p>But the fact is I was napping,</p>
<p>And so gently you came rapping,</p>
<p>And so faintly you came tapping,</p>
<p>Tapping at my chamber door,</p>
<p>That I scarce was sure I heard you.”—</p>
<p>Here I opened wide the door;</p>
<p>Darkness there, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Deep into that darkness peering,</p>
<p>Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,</p>
<p>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals</p>
<p>Ever dared to dream before;</p>
<p>But the silence was unbroken,</p>
<p>And the stillness gave no token,</p>
<p>And the only word there spoken</p>
<p>Was the whispered word, “Lenore!”</p>
<p>This I whispered, and an echo</p>
<p>Murmured back the word, “Lenore!”</p>
<p>Merely this, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Back into the chamber turning,</p>
<p>All my soul within me burning,</p>
<p>Soon again I heard a tapping,</p>
<p>Something louder than before.</p>
<p>“Surely,” said I, “surely, that is</p>
<p>Something at my window lattice;</p>
<p>Let me see then, what thereat is,</p>
<p>And this mystery explore—</p>
<p>Let my heart be still a moment,</p>
<p>And this mystery explore;—</p>
<p>’t is the wind, and nothing more.”</p>
<p>Open here I flung the shutter.</p>
<p>When, with many a flirt and flutter,</p>
<p>In there stepped a stately Raven</p>
<p>Of the saintly days of yore;</p>
<p>Not the least obeisance made he;</p>
<p>Not a minute stopped or stayed he,</p>
<p>But, with mien of lord or lady,</p>
<p>Perched above my chamber door—</p>
<p>Perched upon a bust of Pallas</p>
<p>Just above my chamber door—</p>
<p>Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Then this ebony bird beguiling</p>
<p>My sad fancy into smiling,</p>
<p>By the grave and stern decorum</p>
<p>Of the countenance it wore,</p>
<p>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven,</p>
<p>Thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,</p>
<p>Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven,</p>
<p>Wandering from the nightly shore,</p>
<p>Tell me what thy lordly name is</p>
<p>On the night’s Plutonian shore!”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>Much I marveled this ungainly</p>
<p>Fowl to hear discourse so plainly,</p>
<p>Though its answer little meaning—</p>
<p>Little relevancy bore;</p>
<p>For we can not help agreeing</p>
<p>That no living human being</p>
<p>Ever yet was blest with seeing</p>
<p>Bird above his chamber door—</p>
<p>Bird or beast upon the sculptured</p>
<p>Bust above his chamber door,</p>
<p>With such name as “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>But the Raven, sitting lonely</p>
<p>On that placid bust, spoke only</p>
<p>That one word, as if his soul in</p>
<p>That one word he did outpour.</p>
<p>Nothing farther then he uttered,</p>
<p>Not a feather then he fluttered,</p>
<p>Till I scarcely more than muttered,</p>
<p>“Other friends have flown before—</p>
<p>On the morrow he will leave me,</p>
<p>As my Hopes have flown before.”</p>
<p>Then the bird said, “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>Startled at the stillness broken</p>
<p>By reply so aptly spoken,</p>
<p>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters</p>
<p>Is its only stock and store,</p>
<p>Caught from some unhappy master</p>
<p>Whom unmerciful Disaster</p>
<p>Followed fast and followed faster</p>
<p>Till his songs one burden bore—</p>
<p>Till the dirges of his Hope that</p>
<p>Melancholy burden bore</p>
<p>Of ‘Never—nevermore.’”</p>
<p>But the Raven still beguiling</p>
<p>All my sad soul into smiling,</p>
<p>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in</p>
<p>Front of bird, and bust, and door;</p>
<p>Then, upon the velvet sinking,</p>
<p>I betook myself to linking</p>
<p>Fancy unto fancy, thinking</p>
<p>What this ominous bird of yore—</p>
<p>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly,</p>
<p>Gaunt, and ominous bird of yore</p>
<p>Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>This I sat engaged in guessing,</p>
<p>But no syllable expressing</p>
<p>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now</p>
<p>Burned into my bosom’s core;</p>
<p>This and more I sat divining,</p>
<p>With my head at ease reclining</p>
<p>On the cushion’s velvet lining</p>
<p>That the lamplight gloated o’er,</p>
<p>But whose velvet violet lining,</p>
<p>With the lamplight gloating o’er</p>
<p>She shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>
<p>Then, methought, the air grew denser,</p>
<p>Perfumed from an unseen censer</p>
<p>Swung by Seraphim, whose footfalls</p>
<p>Tinkled on the tufted floor.</p>
<p>“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—</p>
<p>By these angels he hath sent thee</p>
<p>Respite—respite and nepenthe</p>
<p>From thy memories of Lenore!</p>
<p>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe,</p>
<p>And forget this lost Lenore!”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—</p>
<p>Prophet still, if bird or devil!—</p>
<p>Whether Tempter sent, or whether</p>
<p>Tempest tossed thee here ashore,</p>
<p>Desolate, yet all undaunted,</p>
<p>On this desert land enchanted—</p>
<p>On this home by Horror haunted—</p>
<p>Tell me truly, I implore—</p>
<p>Is there—is there balm in Gilead?</p>
<p>Tell me—tell me, I implore!”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil,—</p>
<p>Prophet still, if bird or devil!—</p>
<p>By that heaven that bends above us,</p>
<p>By that God we both adore,</p>
<p>Tell this soul with sorrow laden,</p>
<p>If, within the distant Aidenn,</p>
<p>It shall clasp a sainted maiden</p>
<p>Whom the angels name Lenore—</p>
<p>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden,</p>
<p>Whom the angels name Lenore.”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>“Be that word our sign of parting,</p>
<p>Bird or fiend,” I shrieked, upstarting;</p>
<p>“Get thee back into the tempest</p>
<p>And the night’s Plutonian shore!</p>
<p>Leave no black plume as a token</p>
<p>Of that lie thy soul hath spoken!</p>
<p>Leave my loneliness unbroken!—</p>
<p>Quit the bust above my door!</p>
<p>Take thy beak from out my heart, and</p>
<p>Take thy form from off my door!”</p>
<p>Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>And the Raven, never flitting,</p>
<p>Still is sitting, still is sitting</p>
<p>On the pallid bust of Pallas</p>
<p>Just above my chamber door;</p>
<p>And his eyes have all the seeming</p>
<p>Of a demon’s that is dreaming,</p>
<p>And the lamplight o’er him streaming</p>
<p>Throws his shadow on the floor;</p>
<p>And my soul from out that shadow,</p>
<p>That lies floating on the floor,</p>
<p>Shall be lifted—nevermore!</p>

<p>曾经在一个枯燥的子夜，</p>
<p>沉思凝想的我，疲劳虚弱，</p>
<p>多少卷册的奇谈妙趣</p>
<p>已遗忘的旧事传说——</p>
<p>当我摇晃着脑袋，就要入睡，</p>
<p>突然一声轻拍，</p>
<p>仿佛有人轻柔地，</p>
<p>轻柔地将窗棂叩击。</p>
<p>“有客来访。”我轻声低语，</p>
<p>复听窗棂，</p>
<p>唯有这声轻拍，再无其他声息。</p>
<p>啊，我清晰地记起，</p>
<p>寒冷的十二月里，</p>
<p>每一团即将熄灭的余烬</p>
<p>如幽灵般投影地上。</p>
<p>我渴盼光明的晨曦；</p>
<p>我徒然在书中寻觅，</p>
<p>借以排遣伤心往事。</p>
<p>悲伤是丽诺尔的离去，</p>
<p>天使们叫她叫丽诺尔</p>
<p>她光彩夺目，世上唯一，</p>
<p>可这儿永不再有伊人踪迹。</p>
<p>沙沙有声的紫色窗帘</p>
<p>光滑，忧伤，欲随风飞去，</p>
<p>令我的心一阵激动，充满</p>
<p>不可思议的恐惧，以前从未曾感觉，</p>
<p>以至于现在，为平静</p>
<p>狂跳的心房，我起身复言，</p>
<p>“那是客人请求</p>
<p>入我门来；</p>
<p>某位迟到的客人请求</p>
<p>入我门来；</p>
<p>唯其如此，别无他意。”</p>
<p>我的心灵坚强起来；</p>
<p>于是不再踌躇犹疑，</p>
<p>“先生，”我说，“或是夫人</p>
<p>我真诚地，恳求您的原谅；</p>
<p>情况是我正在小睡，</p>
<p>而您叩击，音轻如斯，</p>
<p>您轻拍打，声微如斯，</p>
<p>敲打房门的声音微弱，</p>
<p>令我不敢确定是否是您来访。”</p>
<p>此时我打开房门，</p>
<p>门外黢黑一片，空无声息。</p>
<p>努力朝黑暗的深处探视，</p>
<p>久久伫立，害怕又惊奇，</p>
<p>疑是做了个凡人</p>
<p>从不敢做的梦；</p>
<p>但寂静是撕不破的黑幕，</p>
<p>依旧无声，</p>
<p>只有一个词语传来</p>
<p>却是软语呢喃，“丽诺尔！”</p>
<p>我这一声低唤换来一声回音，“丽诺尔！”</p>
<p>唯这一声回音，别无声息。</p>
<p>转身返回屋里，</p>
<p>我的整颗心陷入焦灼，</p>
<p>不久一声轻拍复又响起，</p>
<p>这声比先前更加清晰。</p>
<p>“一定，”我说，“一定有什么</p>
<p>在我窗格子旁边，</p>
<p>那么我就一探究竟，</p>
<p>而这神秘探险，</p>
<p>令我的心跳一瞬停止，</p>
<p>而这神秘探险，</p>
<p>是风敲窗棂，别无人迹。”</p>
<p>我打开百叶窗。</p>
<p>挥翅扑翼声声频传，</p>
<p>有只旧时圣日的乌鸦</p>
<p>庄严地走进。</p>
<p>它没有表示起码的敬意，</p>
<p>也没有片刻驻留步履，</p>
<p>却有如王族贵妇的风仪，</p>
<p>飞身房门之上，</p>
<p>又跳落雅典娜的半身雕像，</p>
<p>就在我的房门之上</p>
<p>栖息，端坐，别无他举。</p>
<p>于是这迷惑人的乌黑鸟儿</p>
<p>使我从凄迷的幻觉，转忧为喜，</p>
<p>它带着一脸严肃，</p>
<p>行动坚定不移。</p>
<p>“尽管你的冠顶被剪秃了翎羽，</p>
<p>你，”我说，“肯定不是怯懦者，</p>
<p>残忍，无情，从冥河岸边</p>
<p>漫游至此的老乌鸦，</p>
<p>请告诉我你在冥岸的</p>
<p>尊姓大名！”</p>
<p>乌鸦说，“永不得还。”</p>
<p>这丑陋的鸟儿如此坦率</p>
<p>令我顿感惊奇，</p>
<p>尽管鸟儿的回答毫无意义</p>
<p>又不切命题；</p>
<p>因为我们无法相信</p>
<p>曾有活生生的人亲眼目睹</p>
<p>鸟儿坐在他家房门之上——</p>
<p>鸟畜端坐房门之上的半身雕像，</p>
<p>还取名为“永不得还”。</p>
<p>大乌鸦独坐于</p>
<p>半身雕像之上，仅有一词</p>
<p>出自其口，仿佛它的魂灵</p>
<p>只有那一词需要倾吐。</p>
<p>它并没多发一言，</p>
<p>也没抖动一下翅羽，</p>
<p>而我脱口说出，</p>
<p>“其他朋友早已四散分离</p>
<p>翌日他也会舍我而去，</p>
<p>如同从前我的希望落空一般。”</p>
<p>乌鸦说，“永不得还。”</p>
<p>我惊讶如此一针见血的回答</p>
<p>把死一般的沉寂打破，</p>
<p>“毫无疑问，”我说，“它所说的话</p>
<p>就是它心中全部的积郁，</p>
<p>这个词汇来自某个主人之口</p>
<p>那人命运乖劫，灾难重重</p>
<p>直到他的歌中释出重负，</p>
<p>直到他唱着希望破灭的挽歌，</p>
<p>忧伤地释出重负：</p>
<p>‘永不——永不得还。’</p>
<p>但是这乌鸦仍旧迷人，</p>
<p>让我忧郁的灵魂渐露欢喜，</p>
<p>我将带有坐垫的椅子推至</p>
<p>鸟儿面前，它在门上方的雕像上端坐，</p>
<p>然后，我陷进天鹅绒坐垫，</p>
<p>专心地将一个个幻想串联，思忖</p>
<p>这从前预示凶兆的鸟儿，</p>
<p>这阴郁丑陋，冷酷无情</p>
<p>来自远古的，不祥之鸟，</p>
<p>为何把“永不得还”嘶哑地言说。</p>
<p>我这样坐着，冥思苦想，</p>
<p>然而，我的沉默不语</p>
<p>令那飞禽眼冒怒火</p>
<p>烧灼着我的心；</p>
<p>我把头稍稍向后仰，</p>
<p>越发默坐静想。</p>
<p>天鹅绒衬里的靠垫</p>
<p>笼罩着灯火幽幽的光，</p>
<p>但谁的天鹅绒坐垫，</p>
<p>有灯火笼罩其上，</p>
<p>鸟儿将威迫他：啊，永不得还！</p>
<p>随后我觉得空气变得凝重，</p>
<p>一炉袅袅幽香，</p>
<p>由炽天使的羽翼搅动，他的脚步</p>
<p>在毛绒绒的地毯上叮当作响。</p>
<p>“可怜的人啊，”我大声喊叫，“你的上帝</p>
<p>已派天使到你身旁，已给你送来</p>
<p>暂时的安慰和忘忧的良方</p>
<p>让你走出回忆丽诺尔的忧伤！</p>
<p>痛饮，哦痛饮这杯忘忧药，</p>
<p>把失去的心上人从此遗忘！”</p>
<p>大乌鸦说：“永不得还。”</p>
<p>“先知啊！”我说，“魔鬼东西！</p>
<p>先知也好，是鸟还是魔鬼也罢！</p>
<p>不管撒旦把你送来，还是暴风将你卷至岸边，</p>
<p>你孤独，但无所畏惧。</p>
<p>在这妖魔横行的沙漠荒野，</p>
<p>在这鬼魅出没的家园，</p>
<p>请坦言相告，我恳求你，</p>
<p>有没有，有没有吉列德的软膏？</p>
<p>恳请你告诉我——告诉我可好!？”</p>
<p>大乌鸦说。“永不得还。”</p>
<p>“预告！”我说，“你这鬼东西，</p>
<p>还在预告，你这魔鬼还是飞鸟？</p>
<p>当你经过我们头顶之上穹庐似的天堂，</p>
<p>站在我们崇敬的上帝身旁，</p>
<p>请告诉他这个灵魂浸透了忧伤。</p>
<p>倘若，在遥远的伊甸园里，</p>
<p>这个灵魂会抓住一个圣洁的仙女，</p>
<p>哦，丽诺尔就是仙女之名，</p>
<p>哦灵魂紧紧拥抱唯一的圣洁仙女，</p>
<p>丽诺尔就是仙女之名。”</p>
<p>乌鸦说：“永不得还。”</p>
<p>“让这句当作我们的道别，</p>
<p>鸟儿或恶魔，”我一跃而起尖声叫喊，</p>
<p>“回你的暴风雨中去吧</p>
<p>回到你那永夜的冥河岸边！</p>
<p>不要留下一根黑羽</p>
<p>证明你的灵魂在此讲过片语只言，</p>
<p>我只要为情不渝的孤独。</p>
<p>请离开我房门之上的雕像！</p>
<p>你的鸟嘴啄伤了我的心脏，</p>
<p>离开我的房门，消失你的形象！”</p>
<p>乌鸦严厉地说：“永不得还。”</p>
<p>这只乌鸦，没有起飞，</p>
<p>端坐不动，端坐不动，</p>
<p>就在房门上方</p>
<p>雅典娜苍白的半身雕像上，</p>
<p>他的眼神似有</p>
<p>魔鬼梦中的一切幻象，</p>
<p>笼罩着他的灯光，如溪流</p>
<p>将他投影地上；</p>
<p>我的灵魂摆脱了阴影的压抑，</p>
<p>那阴影在地板上漂浮，</p>
<p>徐徐起飞——永不得还！</p>

<p>A VIEW OF THE COLOSSEUM</p>
<p>罗马竞技场的风景</p>
<p>Orville Dewey, 1794-1882, a well known Unitarian clergyman and
author, was born in Sheffield, Massachusetts, graduated with distinction
at Williams College in 1814, and afterward studied theology at Andover.
For a while he was assistant to Dr. W. E. Channing in Boston, and later,
was a pastor in New Bedford, New York City, and Boston. He made two or
three voyages to Europe, and published accounts of his travels.</p>
<p>“Discourses on Human Life,” “Discourses on the Nature of Religion,”
“Discourses on Commerce and Business,” are among his published works.
His writings are both philosophical and practical; and, as a preacher,
he was esteemed original, earnest, and impressive.</p>
<p>On the eighth of November, from the high land, about fourteen miles
distant, I first saw Rome; and although there is something very
unfavorable to impression in the expectation that you are to be greatly
impressed, or that you ought to be, or that such is the fashion; yet
Rome is too mighty a name to be withstood by such or any other
influences. Let you come upon that hill in what mood you may, the scene
will lay hold upon you as with the hand of a giant. I scarcely know how
to describe the impression, but it seemed to me as if something strong
and stately, like the slow and majestic march of a mighty whirlwind,
swept around those eternal towers; the storms of time, that had
prostrated the proudest monuments of the world, seemed to have left
their vibrations in the still and solemn air; ages of history passed
before me; the mighty procession of nations, kings, consuls, emperors,
empires, and generations had passed over that sublime theater. The fire,
the storm, the earthquake, had gone by; but there was yet left the
still, small voice like that at which the prophet “wrapped his face in
his mantle.”</p>
<p>I went to see the Colosseum by moonlight. It is the monarch, the
majesty of all ruins; there is nothing like it. All the associations of
the place, too, give it the most impressive character. When you enter
within this stupendous circle of ruinous walls and arches, and grand
terraces of masonry, rising one above another, you stand upon the arena
of the old gladiatorial combats and Christian martyrdom; and as you lift
your eyes to the vast amphitheater, you meet, in imagination, the eyes
of a hundred thousand Romans, assembled to witness these bloody
spectacles. What a multitude and mighty array of human beings; and how
little do we know in modern times of great assemblies! One, two, and
three, and, at its last enlargement by Constantine, more than three
hundred thousand persons could be seated in the Circus Maximus!</p>
<p>But to return to the Colosseum; we went up under the conduct of a
guide upon the walls and terraces, or embankments, which supported the
ranges of seats. The seats have long since disappeared; and grass
overgrows the spots where the pride, and power, and wealth, and beauty
of Rome sat down to its barbarous entertainments. What thronging life
was here then! What voices, what greetings, what hurrying footsteps upon
the staircases of the eighty arches of entrance! And now, as we picked
our way carefully through the decayed passages, or cautiously ascended
some moldering flight of steps, or stood by the lonely walls—ourselves
silent, and, for a wonder, the guide silent, too—there was no sound here
but of the bat, and none came from without but the roll of a distant
carriage, or the convent bell from the summit of the neighboring
Esquiline.</p>
<p>It is scarcely possible to describe the effect of moonlight upon this
ruin. Through a hundred lonely arches and blackened passageways it
streamed in, pure, bright, soft, lambent, and yet distinct and clear, as
if it came there at once to reveal, and cheer, and pity the mighty
desolation. But if the Colosseum is a mournful and desolate spectacle as
seen from within—without, and especially on the side which is in best
preservation, it is glorious. We passed around it; and, as we looked
upward, the moon shining through its arches, from the opposite side, it
appeared as if it were the coronet of the heavens, so vast was it—or
like a glorious crown upon the brow of night.</p>
<p>I feel that I do not and can not describe this mighty ruin. I can
only say that I came away paralyzed, and as passive as a child. A
soldier stretched out his hand for “un dona,” as we passed the guard;
and when my companion said I did wrong to give, I told him that I should
have given my cloak, if the man had asked it. Would you break any spell
that worldly feeling or selfish sorrow may have spread over your mind,
go and see the Colosseum by moonlight.</p>

<p>11月8号这天，我登上了距罗马大约十四英里的高地，首次居高临下地俯瞰罗马。尽管有些印象不是尽如人意，远非你所期冀的样子——或者是你本该更为震撼，或者是当时风尚就该人人都受到震撼。然而罗马是个如此显赫的名字，任何这样那样的印象都不会影响它的威名，无论你怀揣什么样心情登上山来，山上的场景就如巨人之手将你的心一把给搦住了。我感到言辞匮乏，简直不知如何描述感受，一股强烈庄严的东西，如强劲的龙卷风，缓慢庄严地刮过，绕过那些不朽的古塔；时间的风暴，屈服于这世间深以为傲的建筑纪念物，好似在宁和庄严的天空一起约定了一般。历史的年轮在我面前轧轧而过；在那座庄严的剧院之前，执政者、帝王、君王、一个个帝国、一代代人、一个个国家的浩荡大军穿行而过。天火、风暴、地震曾给它洗礼，但是尚留下一个声音，平静微小，像那一句：“他的斗篷将他的脸包裹。”</p>
<p>趁着月色，我去参观罗马竞技场。这儿每一片废墟都昭示着帝王的威仪；世上没有哪儿的遗迹与之堪比。每一座与之相关的遗物，都赋予了它令人永生难忘的特色。当你进入这个残垣断壁和拱门组成的巨大圆圈里，踩着豪华的石头砌成的台阶拾级而上，站在了古代剑士挥剑比武的舞台，基督徒殉教的地方；随着你举目放眼巨大的圆形竞技场，在想象之中，你的目光与聚集在一起观看血腥角斗场景的千万双罗马人的眼睛相遇。一列列一排排，如此众多的人啊；今日我们对“盛大聚会”这个概念真是所知甚少啊！一次、两次、三次的扩建，到了康斯坦丁大帝完成最后一次扩建之时，马克西穆斯竞技场有高达三十多万个座位可供观众舒服地坐下来狂欢娱乐！</p>
<p>还是返回罗马竞技场吧；在导游的带领下我们登上了墙壁和露台，登上了支撑一排排座位的路堤。这些座位早就消失无影；茂盛的野草占据的那些位置，曾是有权有势、富有美丽的罗马女人坐享血腥娱乐的地方。那时这儿有多少人拥来挤去呀！而八十座拱门入口的台阶之上，有多少声音嘈杂，有多少问候致礼，有多少纷沓而至的脚步呀！而此刻，我们小心翼翼地从繁华不再的过道上择路而行，或是登上一些腐朽的楼梯，或是倚着孤凄的残垣而立。因为惊奇，我们一个个哑然失语，就连导游也安静得出奇。现在夜空中只有蝙蝠振翅的声音，远处辘辘的四轮马车声传来，还有附近埃斯奎林山顶上，女修道院的钟声幽然入耳。</p>
<p>此刻月光笼罩着废墟，那种震撼我竟是无法用语言描述。透过一百座寂寞的拱门，月光在黑漆漆的过道里涌动，纯洁、明亮、柔和、摇曳，景物都清晰可辨，好像顷刻而现的月光是为了重现、为了鼓励、为了怜悯这无边无际的荒凉。倘若正如从其内外所见，竞技场是一座悲哀的荒凉的奇观——尤其是竞技场保留最完好的一侧，那它就是世上最辉煌壮丽的奇观。我们绕着它走过去；就在我们举头望向明月之时，月光温柔地倾洒在一座座石拱门之上，宛若是天国的花冠，如此巨大的花冠——又像夜神额头上辉煌闪耀的王冠。</p>
<p>我感到词穷语竭，难以形容对这座庞大废墟的感受。我只能说离去的脚步绵软无力，而我就像个被动地迈着脚步的孩子。我们经过岗哨时，一个门卫伸手要“小费”；出来后我的同伴说我不该给他，我对同伴说，倘若他张口要我的披风，我会不吝赠送。你若是打破了某个咒语，让世俗的感情或是自私的懊悔在你心中弥漫，那你不妨趁着月色朦胧，去参观一下罗马竞技场吧。</p>

<p>THE BRIDGE</p>
<p>桥</p>
<p>I stood on the bridge at midnight,</p>
<p>As the clocks were striking the hour,</p>
<p>And the moon rose o’er the city,</p>
<p>Behind the dark church tower.</p>
<p>I saw her bright reflection</p>
<p>In the waters under me,</p>
<p>Like a golden goblet falling</p>
<p>And sinking into the sea.</p>
<p>And far in the hazy distance</p>
<p>Of that lovely night in June,</p>
<p>The blaze of the flaming furnace</p>
<p>Gleamed redder than the moon.</p>
<p>Among the long, black rafters</p>
<p>The wavering shadows lay,</p>
<p>And the current that came from the ocean</p>
<p>Seemed to lift and bear them away;</p>
<p>As, sweeping and eddying through them,</p>
<p>Rose the belated tide,</p>
<p>And, streaming into the moonlight,</p>
<p>The seaweed floated wide.</p>
<p>And like those waters rushing</p>
<p>Among the wooden piers,</p>
<p>A flood of thoughts came o’er me</p>
<p>That filled my eyes with tears</p>
<p>How often, oh, how often,</p>
<p>In the days that had gone by,</p>
<p>I had stood on that bridge at midnight</p>
<p>And gazed on that wave and sky!</p>
<p>How often, oh, how often,</p>
<p>I had wished that the ebbing tide</p>
<p>Would bear me away on its bosom</p>
<p>O’er the ocean wild and wide.</p>
<p>For my heart was hot and restless,</p>
<p>And my life was full of care,</p>
<p>And the burden laid upon me</p>
<p>Seemed greater than I could bear.</p>
<p>But now it has fallen from me,</p>
<p>It is buried in the sea;</p>
<p>And only the sorrow of others</p>
<p>Throws its shadow over me.</p>
<p>Yet, whenever I cross the river</p>
<p>On its bridge with wooden piers,</p>
<p>Like the odor of brine from the ocean</p>
<p>Comes the thought of other years.</p>
<p>And I think how many thousands</p>
<p>Of care-encumbered men,</p>
<p>Each bearing his burden of sorrow,</p>
<p>Have crossed the bridge since then.</p>
<p>I see the long procession</p>
<p>Still passing to and fro,</p>
<p>The young heart hot and restless,</p>
<p>And the old, subdued and slow!</p>
<p>And forever and forever,</p>
<p>As long as the river flows,</p>
<p>As long as the heart has passions,</p>
<p>As long as life has woes;</p>
<p>The moon and its broken reflection</p>
<p>And its shadows shall appear</p>
<p>As the symbol of love in heaven,</p>
<p>And its wavering image here.</p>

<p>OBJECTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENCE</p>
<p>科学的目标与局限</p>
<p>Robert Charles Winthrop, 1809-1894, was a descendant of John
Winthrop, the first Governor of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay. He was
born in Boston, studied at the public Latin School, graduated at Harvard
in 1828, and studied law with Daniel Webster. Possessing an ample
fortune, he made little effort to practice his profession. In 1834 he
was elected to the Legislature of his native state, and was reelected
five times; three years he was Speaker of the House of Representatives.
In 1840 he was chosen to Congress, and sat as Representative for ten
years. In 1847 he was chosen Speaker of the House. He also served a
short time in the Senate. His published writings are chiefly in the form
of addresses and speeches; they are easy, finished, and scholarly. As a
speaker, Mr. Winthrop was ready, full-voiced, and self-possessed.</p>
<p>There are fields enough for the wildest and most extravagant
theorizings, within man’s own appropriate domain, without overleaping
the barriers which separate things human and divine. Indeed, I have
often thought that modern science had afforded a most opportune and
providential safety valve for the intellectual curiosity and ambition of
man, at a moment when the progress of education, invention, and liberty
had roused and stimulated him to a pitch of such unprecedented eagerness
and ardor. Astronomy, Chemistry, and, more than all, Geology, with their
incidental branches of study, have opened an inexhaustible field for
investigation and speculation. Here, by the aid of modern instruments
and modern modes of analysis, the most ardent and earnest spirits may
find ample room and verge enough for their insatiate activity and
audacious enterprise, and may pursue their course not only without the
slightest danger of doing mischief to others, but with the certainty of
promoting the great end of scientific truth.</p>
<p>Let them lift their vast reflectors or refractors to the skies, and
detect new planets in their hiding places. Let them waylay the fugitive
comets in their flight, and compel them to disclose the precise period
of their orbits, and to give bonds for their punctual return. Let them
drag out reluctant satellites from “their habitual concealments.” Let
them resolve the unresolvable nebulae of Orion or Andromeda. They need
not fear. The sky will not fall, nor a single star be shaken from its
sphere.</p>
<p>Let them perfect and elaborate their marvelous processes of making
the light and the lightning their ministers, for putting “a pencil of
rays” into the hand of art, and providing tongues of fire for the
communication of intelligence. Let them foretell the path of the
whirlwind, and calculate the orbit of the storm. Let them hang out their
gigantic pendulums, and make the earth do the work of describing and
measuring her own motions.</p>
<p>Let them annihilate human pain, and literally “charm ache with air,
and agony with ether.” The blessing of God will attend all their toils,
and the gratitude of man will await all their triumphs. Let them dig
down into the bowels of the earth. Let them rive asunder the massive
rocks, and unfold the history of creation as it lies written on the
pages of their piled up strata. Let them gather up the fossil fragments
of a lost Fauna, reproducing the ancient forms which inhabited the land
or the seas, bringing them together, bone to his bone, till Leviathan
and Behemoth stand before us in bodily presence and in their full
proportions, and we almost tremble lest these dry bones should live
again! Let them put nature to the rack, and torture her, in all her
forms, to the betrayal of her inmost secrets and confidences. They need
not forbear. The foundations of the round world have been laid so strong
that they can not be moved.</p>
<p>But let them not think by searching to find out God. Let them not
dream of understanding the Almighty to perfection. Let them not dare to
apply their tests and solvents, their modes of analysis or their terms
of definition, to the secrets of the spiritual kingdom. Let them spare
the foundations of faith. Let them be satisfied with what is revealed of
the mysteries of the Divine Nature. Let them not break through the
bounds to gaze after the Invisible.</p>

<p>在人类自身的范围内，不必跨越划分人与神的界限，有些领域就足够建立极尽疯狂而超乎想象的理论。我常常觉得，教育的进步、发明与民主自由顷刻间将人们唤醒，激发人们的渴望与热情空前高涨之时，现代科学确实已经为人类智力上的好奇与勃勃野心，提供了一个极其恰当而及时的安全阀门。天文学、化学、特别是地质学，以及它们的科学分支，已经为调查思索开启了无穷尽的视野。此时，借助现代仪器与现代的分析方式，那些最积极热情的人们，就可能为他们永不知足的行动和无畏的进取心找到宽阔的空间和足够的边界；而他们所追求的事业，不仅不会对别人造成一丝伤害，而且肯定能促进实现科学真理的伟大目标。</p>
<p>让他们将反射镜或者折射望远镜发射到太空，去探测藏匿宇宙的新行星。让他们借助将神出鬼没的彗星拦截，迫使彗星向人类揭露其精确的轨道运行周期，并且要其保证准时返回。让他们将顽抗的卫星从惯以隐匿之处拖拽而出。让他们分解那无法分解的猎户座及仙女座星云。他们无需害怕。天空不会塌陷，也不会有一颗恒星从它运行的天体中震落。</p>
<p>让他们细细述说那了不起的经历：他们如何点燃了智慧明灯，并用这盏灯照亮了政府前进的路途，就是他们把“一束光线”交入化腐朽为神奇的艺术之手，为智慧的对话提供了火热的语言。让他们预告龙卷风的路径，预测风暴的走向。让他们悬挂他们那巨大的钟摆，使地球自发地描述与测量本身的发展和运动。</p>
<p>让他们消灭人类的痛苦，确实做到“用气体祛除疼痛，用乙醚麻醉剧痛”。上帝的福佑将会庇护他们付出的一切辛劳，而受惠的人们将心存感激地等待他们的凯旋。让他们挖到地心。让他们粉碎庞大的岩石，揭开地层之间所书写的生物史。让他们收集已灭绝的动物群化石碎片，复制地上行走、水中浮游的古代物种，汇拢化石，对接一块块骨头，直到利维坦和巨兽体格丰满地站立我们面前，而我们怕那些干枯的骨头复活吓得几乎索索发抖！让他们把自然放上拷问台，用她的各种存在形式拷问她，使得自然把私藏心底的秘密对人类和盘托出。他们无需克制自我。因为我们这个圆溜溜的世界的根基如此坚固，他们不会从此间掉落。</p>
<p>然而，不要让他们有千方百计寻求上帝的念头。不要让他们妄想全然了解万能的神。不要让他们胆敢把试验与溶剂、分解模式以及各种定义关系，运用于研究精神王国的奥秘。不要让他们损坏信仰的基石。就让他们满足于眼前所现的神性之奥妙。不要让他们打破疆界，凝视着上帝的身后。</p>

<p>LABOR</p>
<p>劳动</p>
<p>Horace Greeley, 1811-1872, perhaps the most famous editor of America,
was born in Amherst, New Hampshire, of poor parents. His boyhood was
passed in farm labor, in attending the common school, and in reading
every book on which he could lay his hands. His reading was mostly done
by the light of pine knots. At fifteen he entered a printing office in
Vermont, became the best workman in the office, and continued to improve
every opportunity for study. At the age of twenty he appeared in New
York City, poorly clothed, and almost destitute of money. He worked at
his trade for a year or two, and then set up printing for himself. For
several years he was not successful, but struggled on, performing an
immense amount of work as an editor. In 1841 he established the “New
York Tribune,” which soon became one of the most successful and
influential papers in the country. In 1848 he was elected to Congress,
but remained but a short time. In 1872 he was a candidate for the
Presidency, was defeated, and died a few days afterward. Mr. Greeley is
a rare example of what may be accomplished by honesty and unflinching
industry. Besides the vast amount which he wrote for the newspapers, he
published several books; the best known of which is “The American
Conflict.”</p>
<p>Every child should be trained to dexterity in some useful branch of
productive industry, not in order that he shall certainly follow that
pursuit, but that he may at all events be able to do so in case he shall
fail in the more intellectual or artificial calling which he may prefer
to it. Let him seek to be a doctor, lawyer, preacher, poet, if he will;
but let him not stake his all on success in that pursuit, but have a
second line to fall back upon if driven from his first. Let him be so
reared and trained that he may enter, if he will, upon some intellectual
calling in the sustaining consciousness that he need not debase himself,
nor do violence to his convictions, in order to achieve success therein,
since he can live and thrive in another (if you choose, humbler)
vocation, if driven from that of his choice. This buttress to integrity,
this assurance of self-respect, is to be found in a universal training
to efficiency in Productive Labor.</p>
<p>The world is full of misdirection and waste; but all the calamities
and losses endured by mankind through frost, drought, blight, hail,
fires, earthquakes, inundations, are as nothing to those habitually
suffered by them through human idleness and inefficiency, mainly caused
(or excused) by lack of industrial training. It is quite within the
truth to estimate that one tenth of our people, in the average, are
habitually idle because (as they say) they can find no employment. They
look for work where it can not be had. They seem to be, or they are,
unable to do such as abundantly confronts and solicits them. Suppose
these to average but one million able-bodied persons, and that their
work is worth but one dollar each per day; our loss by involuntary
idleness can not be less than $300,000,000 per annum. I judge that it is
actually $500,000,000. Many who stand waiting to be hired could earn
from two to five dollars per day had they been properly trained to work.
“There is plenty of room higher up,” said Daniel Webster, in response to
an inquiry as to the prospects of a young man just entering upon the
practice of law; and there is never a dearth of employment for men or
women of signal capacity or skill. In this city, ten thousand women are
always doing needlework for less than fifty cents per day, finding
themselves; yet twice their number of capable, skillful seamstresses
could find steady employment and good living in wealthy families at not
less than one dollar per day over and above board and lodging. He who is
a good blacksmith, a fair millwright, a tolerable wagon maker, and can
chop timber, make fence, and manage a small farm if required, is always
sure of work and fair recompense; while he or she who can keep books or
teach music fairly, but knows how to do nothing else, is in constant
danger of falling into involuntary idleness and consequent beggary. It
is a broad, general truth, that no boy was ever yet inured to daily,
systematic, productive labor in field or shop throughout the latter half
of his minority, who did not prove a useful man, and was notable to find
work whenever he wished it.</p>
<p>Yet to the ample and constant employment of a whole community one
prerequisite is indispensable,—that a variety of pursuits shall have
been created or naturalized therein. A people who have but a single
source of profit are uniformly poor, not because that vocation is
necessarily ill-chosen, but because no single calling can employ and
reward the varied capacities of male and female, old and young, robust
and feeble. Thus a lumbering or fishing region with us is apt to have a
large proportion of needy inhabitants; and the same is true of a region
exclusively devoted to cotton growing or gold mining. A diversity of
pursuits is indispensable to general activity and enduring
prosperity.</p>
<p>Sixty or seventy years ago, what was then the District, and is now
the State, of Maine, was a proverb in New England for the poverty of its
people, mainly because they were so largely engaged in timber cutting.
The great grain-growing, wheat-exporting districts of the Russian empire
have a poor and rude people for a like reason. Thus the industry of
Massachusetts is immensely more productive per head than that of North
Carolina, or even that of Indiana, as it will cease to be whenever
manufactures shall have been diffused over our whole country, as they
must and will be. In Massachusetts half the women and nearly half the
children add by their daily labor to the aggregate of realized wealth;
in North Carolina and in Indiana little wealth is produced save by the
labor of men, including boys of fifteen or upward. When this disparity
shall have ceased, its consequence will also disappear.</p>

<p>对于某些生产工业的旁支行业，每个孩子都应接受训练，熟练掌握其技艺，不是为了他必将从事那项工作，而是为了培养应变的能力，以防万一他无法胜任对于才智与技艺有更高要求的心仪职业。让他去做医生、律师、传教士、诗人——假如他可以；但是让他别把希望的鸡蛋都放在一个篮子里，因此，有第二手准备就不怕第一选择失败。让他悉心接受教育与系统培训——假如他能够进入某些需要才智的行业，他需要一直具备这种意识，即为了在他心仪的职业中取得成功，他不需要自我贬低，也无需自我罪责，如果那条路没走通，还有另外的生路可以让他活得有声有色。这种稳定的精神支撑，这种对自尊的保护，在生产劳动的过程中就会显现出普遍培训产生的效益。</p>
<p>现实生活中充满错误的方向引导和各种浪费；人类因严寒、干旱、虫害、冰雹、火灾、地震、洪涝所承受的灾害损失，与那些因人类习惯性懒散以及由于缺乏职业培训引起的无效率所造成的损失相比是不值一提。的确，我们可以说，我们人类有十分之一通常是习惯性懒散的，因为他们想干的工作根本找不到。他们似乎是不愿招揽麻烦、面对太多问题，或者说本性如此。假设一百万身强体壮的人，他们的工作平均每天仅值一美元；我们因无意识懒散造成的损失每年就可能不下三亿美元，而据我判断实际上会有五亿美元。</p>
<p>若是许多人就所从事职业接受过适当的培训，那么他们坐等受聘就能每天赚到一两美元。丹尼尔·韦伯斯特在回答一位年轻的实习律师的询问时如此说道：“提升机会很多。”有一技之长的男女从来不缺雇主。此城内，有一万女裁缝一直做着每天收入不到五十美分的活计，以此找到自己的价值；然而能力超过她们两倍、手工活路精巧的女裁缝，则能够在富有的家庭里工作，获得稳定的收入和优质的生活，这些家庭每天给她们提供食宿，每天的报酬不少于一美元。一个人有一手精湛的打铁手艺，造水车是拿手活，制作的四轮马车也不错，那么他自然会砍柴、会做栅栏，如果需要的话还能管理一个小农场，自然，他永远不愁活干不缺饭吃。而相当一部分只会管理管理图书、教教音乐、除此别无所长的人，经常身不由己地陷入失业危机，沦落至濒临乞讨的境地。一个不容争辩的事实是，没有哪个男孩在他从少年跨入成年的那几年时间习惯于终日在田野劳作，或者按部就班地在店铺干活，此时他还没有证明自己长大成人，还不能胜任时常渴望的那份工作。</p>
<p>然而对整个社会不断涌现的就业大军而言，一个必不可少的先决条件是，社会本就该创造多样化就业机会并且使之规范化。一群仅有单项盈利手段的人一律贫穷，原因不在行业的选择错误，而是因为没有一个行业能雇佣所有的人并付与报酬。因此，就我们来看，一个伐木区或是渔业区的居民生活趋向于贫困；一个热衷种植棉花或金矿开采的地方同样如此；行业的多样化对大众活动和经济繁荣的持久是必不可少的。</p>
<p>六七十年以前这儿还是个区，现在成了缅因州，在整个新英格兰之中这儿以贫穷而闻名，原因主要是人们广泛地从事木材砍伐的工作。同样原因，俄罗斯帝国的行政区主要种植谷类、出口小麦，由于类似的原因，也导致那儿的人贫穷而落后。因此，马萨诸塞州平均每人的工业产值比北卡罗莱纳州要高，甚至比印第安纳州更高，只有制造业在我们的国家遍地开花的时候，这种差距才会终止——这必须终止，也将必然终止。在马萨诸塞州有半数女人、将近一半的儿童靠日常劳动增加实际财富；而在北卡罗莱纳州和印第安纳州靠男子——包括十五岁以上的青壮年男子劳动则几乎积蓄不下财富。这种差异终了之日，就是贫富不等消弭之时。</p>

<p>THE LAST DAYS OF HERCULANEUM</p>
<p>赫库兰尼姆的末日</p>
<p>Edwin Atherstone, 1788-1872, was born at Nottingham, England, and
became known to the literary world chiefly through two poems, “The Last
Days of Herculaneum” and “The Fall of Nineveh.” Both poems are written
in blank verse, and are remarkable for their splendor of diction and
their great descriptive power. Atherstone is compared to Thomson, whom
he resembles somewhat in style.</p>
<p>There was a man,</p>
<p>A Roman soldier, for some daring deed</p>
<p>That trespassed on the laws, in dungeon low</p>
<p>Chained down. His was a noble spirit, rough,</p>
<p>But generous, and brave, and kind.</p>
<p>He had a son; it was a rosy boy,</p>
<p>A little faithful copy of his sire,</p>
<p>In face and gesture. From infancy, the child</p>
<p>Had been his father’s solace and his care.</p>
<p>Every sport</p>
<p>The father shared and heightened. But at length,</p>
<p>The rigorous law had grasped him, and condemned</p>
<p>To fetters and to darkness.</p>
<p>The captive’s lot,</p>
<p>He felt in all its bitterness: the walls</p>
<p>Of his deep dungeon answered many a sigh</p>
<p>And heart-heaved groan. His tale was known, and touched</p>
<p>His jailer with compassion; and the boy,</p>
<p>Thenceforth a frequent visitor, beguiled</p>
<p>His father’s lingering hours, and brought a balm</p>
<p>With his loved presence, that in every wound</p>
<p>Dropped healing. But, in this terrific hour,</p>
<p>He was a poisoned arrow in the breast</p>
<p>Where he had been a cure.</p>
<p>With earliest morn</p>
<p>Of that first day of darkness and amaze,</p>
<p>He came. The iron door was closed—for them</p>
<p>Never to open more! The day, the night</p>
<p>Dragged slowly by; nor did they know the fate</p>
<p>Impending o’er the city. Well they heard</p>
<p>The pent-up thunders in the earth beneath,</p>
<p>And felt its giddy rocking; and the air</p>
<p>Grew hot at length, and thick; but in his straw</p>
<p>The boy was sleeping: and the father hoped</p>
<p>The earthquake might pass by: nor would he wake</p>
<p>From his sound rest the unfearing child, nor tell</p>
<p>The dangers of their state.</p>
<p>On his low couch</p>
<p>The fettered soldier sank, and, with deep awe,</p>
<p>Listened the fearful sounds: with upturned eye,</p>
<p>To the great gods he breathed a prayer; then, strove</p>
<p>To calm himself, and lose in sleep awhile</p>
<p>His useless terrors. But he could not sleep:</p>
<p>His body burned with feverish heat; his chains</p>
<p>Clanked loud, although he moved not; deep in earth</p>
<p>Groaned unimaginable thunders; sounds,</p>
<p>Fearful and ominous, arose and died,</p>
<p>Like the sad mornings of November’s wind,</p>
<p>In the blank midnight. Deepest horror chilled</p>
<p>His blood that burned before; cold, clammy sweats</p>
<p>Came o’er him; then anon, a fiery thrill</p>
<p>Shot through his veins. Now, on his couch he shrunk</p>
<p>And shivered as in fear; now, upright leaped,</p>
<p>As though he heard the battle trumpet sound,</p>
<p>And longed to cope with death.</p>
<p>He slept, at last,</p>
<p>A troubled, dreamy sleep. Well had he slept</p>
<p>Never to waken more! His hours are few,</p>
<p>But terrible his agony.</p>
<p>Soon the storm</p>
<p>Burst forth; the lightnings glanced; the air</p>
<p>Shook with the thunders. They awoke; they sprung</p>
<p>Amazed upon their feet. The dungeon glowed</p>
<p>A moment as in sunshine—and was dark:</p>
<p>Again, a flood of white flame fills the cell,</p>
<p>Dying away upon the dazzled eye</p>
<p>In darkening, quivering tints, as stunning sound</p>
<p>Dies throbbing, ringing in the ear.</p>
<p>With intensest awe,</p>
<p>The soldier’s frame was filled; and many a thought</p>
<p>Of strange foreboding hurried through his mind,</p>
<p>As underneath he felt the fevered earth</p>
<p>Jarring and lifting; and the massive walls,</p>
<p>Heard harshly grate and strain: yet knew he not,</p>
<p>While evils undefined and yet to come</p>
<p>Glanced through his thoughts, what deep and cureless wound</p>
<p>Fate had already given.—Where, man of woe!</p>
<p>Where, wretched father! is thy boy? Thou call’st</p>
<p>His name in vain:—he can not answer thee.</p>
<p>Loudly the father called upon his child:</p>
<p>No voice replied. Trembling and anxiously</p>
<p>He searched their couch of straw; with headlong haste</p>
<p>Trod round his stinted limits, and, low bent,</p>
<p>Groped darkling on the earth:—no child was there.</p>
<p>Again he called: again, at farthest stretch</p>
<p>Of his accursed fetters, till the blood</p>
<p>Seemed bursting from his ears, and from his eyes</p>
<p>Fire flashed, he strained with arm extended far,</p>
<p>And fingers widely spread, greedy to touch</p>
<p>Though but his idol’s garment. Useless toil!</p>
<p>Yet still renewed: still round and round he goes,</p>
<p>And strains, and snatches, and with dreadful cries</p>
<p>Calls on his boy.</p>
<p>Mad frenzy fires him now.</p>
<p>He plants against the wall his feet; his chain</p>
<p>Grasps; tugs with giant strength to force away</p>
<p>The deep-driven staple; yells and shrieks with rage:</p>
<p>And, like a desert lion in the snare,</p>
<p>Raging to break his toils,—to and fro bounds.</p>
<p>But see! the ground is opening;—a blue light</p>
<p>Mounts, gently waving,—noiseless;—thin and cold</p>
<p>It seems, and like a rainbow tint, not flame;</p>
<p>But by its luster, on the earth outstretched,</p>
<p>Behold the lifeless child! his dress is singed,</p>
<p>And, o’er his face serene, a darkened line</p>
<p>Points out the lightning’s track.</p>
<p>The father saw,</p>
<p>And all his fury fled:—a dead calm fell</p>
<p>That instant on him:—speechless—fixed—he stood,</p>
<p>And with a look that never wandered, gazed</p>
<p>Intensely on the corse. Those laughing eyes</p>
<p>Were not yet closed,—and round those ruby lips</p>
<p>The wonted smile returned.</p>
<p>Silent and pale</p>
<p>The father stands:—no tear is in his eye:—</p>
<p>The thunders bellow;—but he hears them not:—</p>
<p>The ground lifts like a sea;—he knows it not:—</p>
<p>The strong walls grind and gape:—the vaulted roof</p>
<p>Takes shape like bubble tossing in the wind;</p>
<p>See! he looks up and smiles; for death to him</p>
<p>Is happiness. Yet could one last embrace</p>
<p>Be given, ’t were still a sweeter thing to die.</p>
<p>It will be given. Look! how the rolling ground,</p>
<p>At every swell, nearer and still more near</p>
<p>Moves toward the father’s outstretched arm his boy.</p>
<p>Once he has touched his garment:—how his eye</p>
<p>Lightens with love, and hope, and anxious fears!</p>
<p>Ha, see! he has him now!—he clasps him round;</p>
<p>Kisses his face; puts back the curling locks,</p>
<p>That shaded his fine brow; looks in his eyes;</p>
<p>Grasps in his own those little dimpled hands;</p>
<p>Then folds him to his breast, as he was wont</p>
<p>To lie when sleeping; and resigned, awaits</p>
<p>Undreaded death.</p>
<p>And death came soon and swift</p>
<p>And pangless. The huge pile sank down at once</p>
<p>Into the opening earth. Walls—arches—roof—</p>
<p>And deep foundation stones—all—mingling—fell!</p>

<p>从前有一位</p>
<p>罗马士兵，因见义勇为</p>
<p>触犯了法律，身陷囹圄</p>
<p>戴上了脚镣。这人心灵高贵，言行粗鲁，</p>
<p>但是慷慨大方，勇敢善良。</p>
<p>他的儿子，是个脸蛋红润的男孩，</p>
<p>其相貌举止，</p>
<p>简直就是父亲的模样。从呱呱落地</p>
<p>长成半大娃娃，一直是父亲的慰藉和希望。</p>
<p>每一次游戏</p>
<p>父亲与之分享，父子情深意重。可是最终，</p>
<p>无情的法律将他捆绑，宣判死刑，</p>
<p>手脚链锁，被囚禁牢房。</p>
<p>被囚禁的人</p>
<p>品尝了种种的苦涩；地牢深严的四壁</p>
<p>倾听过他多少呻吟</p>
<p>和来自心灵的叹息。他的故事人所共知，而狱卒</p>
<p>同情他的冤屈；那个男孩</p>
<p>此后常来探视，逗引父亲</p>
<p>度过几个小时，他那可爱的小手中</p>
<p>还有一瓶香树膏，不忘给父亲的伤口</p>
<p>涂上镇痛的药。然而在父子相守的时辰里，</p>
<p>他那中了毒箭的胸口</p>
<p>箭伤需要处理。</p>
<p>天还未破晓</p>
<p>那个黑暗的一天，让人吃惊不已，</p>
<p>他的孩子一早来到，铁门在身后关闭，</p>
<p>此后就没再为他们打开！那一天的夜晚</p>
<p>过得十分缓慢；悬在城市上空的劫难</p>
<p>他们也一无所知。他们清楚听到</p>
<p>沉闷的雷声自地壳深处传来，</p>
<p>摇动的地面令人头晕目眩；而天空</p>
<p>越来越热，空气腾腾似火；稻草上的男孩</p>
<p>正在梦乡；父亲希望</p>
<p>孩子睡梦中，地震已经过去，使他免受惊慌，</p>
<p>而他们目前可怕的处境，也不知晓。</p>
<p>在那低矮的牢床，</p>
<p>戴着镣铐的士兵，陷入深深恐惧</p>
<p>谛听可怕的声音；他仰望上空，</p>
<p>默默祈求众神庇护；然后努力地</p>
<p>让自己镇静，片刻睡眠</p>
<p>使恐惧消失。然而他无法深睡：</p>
<p>他滚烫的身体有如火烧；尽管他一动未动，</p>
<p>身上的枷锁，却在叮当作响；地府深处，</p>
<p>难以名状的响雷，还有各种声音，</p>
<p>可怕不祥，突然传来又隐去，</p>
<p>就像十一月阴郁的晨风</p>
<p>消失于空虚的子夜。极度惊慌</p>
<p>使他就要燃烧的身体骤然冰凉；粘湿的冷汗</p>
<p>浑身流淌；而他的四肢百骸，</p>
<p>开始激烈震颤。此刻，由于恐惧</p>
<p>他瑟缩牢床，抖作一团。蓦然，他一跃而起，</p>
<p>似乎战地喇叭正在鸣响，</p>
<p>多么渴望一决死战。</p>
<p>他终于入睡，</p>
<p>一个苦恼的噩梦之眠。酣眠之中，</p>
<p>但愿一睡不醒！生命最后，不过数时，</p>
<p>却是极度痛苦的恐惧。</p>
<p>不久来了暴风雨，</p>
<p>狂吹猛飙；闪电忽隐忽现；天空</p>
<p>跟着滚雷发颤。父子惊醒</p>
<p>一跃而起。地牢瞬间光彩绚丽</p>
<p>有如阳光照耀，继而复又黑暗；</p>
<p>刺眼的白光如洪水涌满牢房，</p>
<p>又从眩惑的眼睛上退去，</p>
<p>变暗的跳动的光彩，正如震耳发聩的声音</p>
<p>消失在轰鸣的耳膜上。</p>
<p>极度敬畏，</p>
<p>挤压着士兵的内心；万千奇怪不祥的预感</p>
<p>涌上了心头，</p>
<p>他感到火热的地底</p>
<p>在震动上升；那厚重的墙壁，</p>
<p>错开缝隙，摩擦声刺耳粗粝。可是他浑然不知，</p>
<p>魔鬼徘徊就要穿透思想的时刻，命运</p>
<p>已经剖开了深深的创口。在那儿，悲痛的男人！</p>
<p>在那儿，可怜的父亲！是不是你的孩子？你唤他</p>
<p>只是徒劳，孩子不会再给你回应。</p>
<p>父亲放声呼叫孩子，</p>
<p>千呼万唤没有醒转。他浑身抖颤，急切地</p>
<p>搜寻他们的草席；狂躁地</p>
<p>踏上那弹丸之地，然后弓身，</p>
<p>黑暗中乱摸一气：孩子已不在那里。</p>
<p>他一声声呼唤，尽量拉长脚链，</p>
<p>他诅咒那恶毒的拷制，直到鲜血</p>
<p>似乎溅出双目，烈火喷出双耳，</p>
<p>就着闪烁的火光，他努力伸长手臂，</p>
<p>十指叉开，痴痴地四处触摸</p>
<p>他幻象里的儿子。徒劳的摸索！</p>
<p>然而依然重复那个动作，依然兜着圈子</p>
<p>他竭尽全力，侥幸能抓到，</p>
<p>撕心裂肺呼喊着的儿子。</p>
<p>现在烈焰疯狂，猛火烧身。</p>
<p>他将双脚抵住墙壁；抓紧</p>
<p>身上的枷锁；用毕生之力</p>
<p>掰开牢固的夹板；疯狂地号叫大喊：</p>
<p>就像荒原雄狮受困陷阱，</p>
<p>勃然大怒要冲出牢笼，来回狂跳。</p>
<p>可是看呀！地面张开巨口；一簇蓝火</p>
<p>悄无声息地往上攀延，轻轻摇晃，似乎</p>
<p>细弱、冰冷，就像彩虹的色调，没有热情；</p>
<p>但是借着蓝火的光亮，地面的巨口继续开张，</p>
<p>看着毫无生命的孩子！他的衣裳嘶嘶作响，</p>
<p>孩子平静的脸上，一道黑线</p>
<p>那是闪电的烧痕。</p>
<p>父亲明白，</p>
<p>所有的愤怒都已怯逃；死亡的平静</p>
<p>瞬间降临：他无法言语，呆若木鸡，石头般伫立</p>
<p>用坚定热切的眼神，凝视着尸体。那双会笑的眼睛</p>
<p>仍然睁着，红宝石般的圆嘴唇</p>
<p>习惯性地对着他笑。</p>
<p>寂静、苍白，</p>
<p>父亲站在那儿，眼中无泪；</p>
<p>焦雷轰鸣，可他充耳不闻；</p>
<p>大地像海水上浮，他丝毫未觉；</p>
<p>坚固的墙壁研磨、开裂：拱形房顶</p>
<p>连盖揭起，就像风中飘飞的气泡；</p>
<p>看呀！他仰头微笑；因为死亡于他</p>
<p>是解脱和快乐。一个人临终若能得到</p>
<p>最后一个拥抱，那么死亡也是美好。</p>
<p>这就是给予的美好，看！大地在怎样地起伏啊</p>
<p>每一次隆起，都是越来越靠近孩子</p>
<p>父亲的手努力朝孩子伸过去。</p>
<p>他一旦摸到孩子的衣裳：他的眼里</p>
<p>充满怎样的爱、希望和急切的忧虑！</p>
<p>啊，看！他抓住了孩子！紧紧抱进怀里；</p>
<p>亲吻他的脸庞；抿了抿他的卷发；</p>
<p>露出他光洁的额头；看着他的双眸；</p>
<p>大手紧紧握住孩子胖乎乎的小手；</p>
<p>然后把他的小手交叠胸前，这是他</p>
<p>惯常的睡姿；然后顺从，平和地等待</p>
<p>死亡来临。</p>
<p>死亡很快到来，</p>
<p>如此迅疾，毫无痛苦。巨大的建筑群</p>
<p>立刻陷入地上的裂口。墙壁、拱门、房顶</p>
<p>深深的石头地基，全都轰然陷落！</p>

<p>HOW MEN REASON</p>
<p>人是如何推理的</p>
<p>My friend, the Professor, whom I have mentioned to you once or twice,
told me yesterday that somebody had been abusing him in some of the
journals of his calling. I told him that I did n’t doubt he deserved it;
that I hoped he did deserve a little abuse occasionally, and would for a
number of years to come; that nobody could do anything to make his
neighbors wiser or better without being liable to abuse for it;
especially that people hated to have their little mistakes made fun of,
and perhaps he had been doing something of the kind. The Professor
smiled.</p>
<p>Now, said I, hear what I am going to say. It will not take many years
to bring you to the period of life when men, at least the majority of
writing and talking men, do nothing but praise. Men, like peaches and
pears, grow sweet a little while before they begin to decay. I don’t
know what it is,—whether a spontaneous change, mental or bodily, or
whether it is through experience of the thanklessness of critical
honesty,—but it is a fact, that most writers, except sour and
unsuccessful ones, get tired of finding fault at about the time when
they are beginning to grow old.</p>
<p>As a general thing, I would not give a great deal for the fair words
of a critic, if he is himself an author, over fifty years of age. At
thirty, we are all trying to cut our names in big letters upon the walls
of this tenement of life; twenty years later, we have carved it, or shut
up our jackknives. Then we are ready to help others, and care less to
hinder any, because nobody’s elbows are in our way. So I am glad you
have a little life left; you will be saccharine enough in a few
years.</p>
<p>Some of the softening effects of advancing age have struck me very
much in what I have heard or seen here and elsewhere. I just now spoke
of the sweetening process that authors undergo. Do you know that in the
gradual passage from maturity to helplessness the harshest characters
sometimes have a period in which they are gentle and placid as young
children? I have heard it said, but I can not be sponsor for its truth,
that the famous chieftain, Lochiel, was rocked in a cradle like a baby,
in his old age. An old man, whose studies had been of the severest
scholastic kind, used to love to hear little nursery stories read over
and over to him. One who saw the Duke of Wellington in his last years
describes him as very gentle in his aspect and demeanor. I remember a
person of singularly stern and lofty bearing who became remarkably
gracious and easy in all his ways in the later period of his life.</p>
<p>And that leads me to say that men often remind me of pears in their
way of coming to maturity. Some are ripe at twenty, like human
Jargonelles, and must be made the most of, for their day is soon over.
Some come into their perfect condition late, like the autumn kinds, and
they last better than the summer fruit. And some, that, like the Winter
Nelis, have been hard and uninviting until all the rest have had their
season, get their glow and perfume long after the frost and snow have
done their worst with the orchards. Beware of rash criticisms; the rough
and stringent fruit you condemn may be an autumn or a winter pear, and
that which you picked up beneath the same bough in August may have been
only its worm—eaten windfalls. Milton was a Saint Germain with a graft
of the roseate Early Catherine. Rich, juicy, lively, fragrant,
russet-skinned old Chaucer was an Easter Beurre’; the buds of a new
summer were swelling when he ripened.</p>

<h4 id="中文阅读-563">中文阅读</h4>
<p>我的朋友，也就是我曾经给你提到过一两次的那位教授，昨天对我说，有人在一些杂志上诋毁他的职业。我说我绝对相信他理应受到这种辱骂；我说我希望他不时地受到点指责，而且未来几年也要如此；我说要让邻居变聪明可能只有辱骂一下他这个办法，尤其是对那些讨厌别人揪住他小辫子不放的人，我想或许他也曾经如此辱骂过别人呢。听到这儿，教授笑了。</p>
<p>现在，请听我说。这个时代的人——至少是绝大多数舞文弄墨、喜欢针砭时弊的人，耍耍笔杆子动动嘴皮子就赢得了一派赞扬，而过不了几年你也会进入这种人生阶段。男人就像桃子和梨，开始腐烂之前都有一段甜蜜时期。我不知道这其中有什么原因，不论是自然变化，还是出于精神或身体原因，抑或是有过直言不讳，人家反而不领情的经历，但这是事实，除了那些酸腐失败的文人，绝大部分作家感到变老的时候跟现实讲和，不再愤世。</p>
<p>总的来说，如果这人本身是个天命之年的作家，我不会给予评论的溢美之词。三十岁时，我们都喜欢在住所的墙壁上刻上自己的大名。二十年后，我们刮掉了名字，收起了折叠刀。然后准备帮助别人，我们不在乎任何阻碍，因为谁的胳膊都挡不住你的去路。所以我很高兴你还有剩余的生命，再过几年，你就会变得更加温柔和气。</p>
<p>我的思想，因道听途说以及亲眼所见的一些年长者的温和变化而深受影响。现在，我只说说作家们经历温和蜕变的过程。你知道从成熟到不能自理这个逐渐发展的过程中，再严厉的人也有如孩子般柔和安静的阶段吗？就我所知是如此，只是我无法保证普遍如此，著名的劳彻尔酋长，老年就像个婴儿一样躺在摇篮里让人摇晃。有位老人，他对学术研究极其严谨认真，过去根本不喜欢听幼儿故事，但是现在不厌其烦地听了一遍又一遍。有个见过晚年惠灵顿公爵的人，形容他的言行举止十分温柔和顺。而我记得的一个性情孤傲的人，生命的最后一段日子变得慈祥随和，与之前相比简直判若两人。</p>
<p>如此就引出了我这番话，思想成熟的过程让我频频地联想到梨子。老成少年就像早熟的鸭梨，烂漫的时光早早就从青春的枝梢坠落。有些人成熟较晚，就像秋梨，吸收了春雨夏阳的精华，自然比夏果味道更醇厚香甜。还有些人，就好比冬果，果壳坚硬，其貌不扬，等到各色水果谢季，霜冻雪压的果园荒芜不堪的时候，他们含艳吐芳，散发的香味馥郁绵长。还有，要当心轻率地评论；你谴责的那种粗粝苦涩的果实可能是秋冬季节的梨子，而且你在八月的同一棵树下捡起的那个梨子，可能是被虫蚀后风吹落地的果子。弥尔顿是一个嫁接了凯瑟琳王朝早期乐观精神的日耳曼圣徒。而有趣、活泼快乐、皮肤赤褐的老乔叟就像复活节的果实，初夏的蓓蕾正要怒放的时候，他成熟了。</p>

<p>阿尔卑斯山上的暴风雨</p>
<p>Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,</p>
<p>With the wild world I dwell in, is a thing</p>
<p>Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake</p>
<p>Earth’s troubled waters for a purer spring.</p>
<p>This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing</p>
<p>To waft me from distraction; once I loved</p>
<p>Torn ocean’s roar, but thy soft murmuring</p>
<p>Sounds sweet, as if a sister’s voice reproved,</p>
<p>That I with stern delights should e’er have been so moved.</p>
<p>All heaven and earth are still—though not in sleep,</p>
<p>But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;</p>
<p>And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep—</p>
<p>All heaven and earth are still: from the high host</p>
<p>Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain coast,</p>
<p>All is concentered in a life intense,</p>
<p>Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,</p>
<p>But hath a part of being, and a sense</p>
<p>Of that which is of all Creator and defense.</p>
<p>The sky is changed! and such a change! O night,</p>
<p>And storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,</p>
<p>Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light</p>
<p>Of a dark eye in woman! Far along,</p>
<p>From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,</p>
<p>Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud,</p>
<p>But every mountain now hath found a tongue,</p>
<p>And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,</p>
<p>Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!</p>
<p>And this is in the night.—Most glorious night!</p>
<p>Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be</p>
<p>A sharer in thy fierce and far delight,—</p>
<p>A portion of the tempest and of thee!</p>
<p>How the lit lake shines,—a phosphoric sea!</p>
<p>And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!</p>
<p>And now again, ’T is black,—and now, the glee</p>
<p>Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain mirth,</p>
<p>As if they did rejoice o’er a young earthquake’s birth.</p>
<p>Now, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between</p>
<p>Heights which appear as lovers who have parted</p>
<p>In hate, whose mining depths so intervene,</p>
<p>That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted;</p>
<p>Though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,</p>
<p>Love was the very root of the fond rage,</p>
<p>Which blighted their life’s bloom, and then—departed.</p>
<p>Itself expired, but leaving them an age</p>
<p>Of years, all winters,—war within themselves to wage.</p>
<p>Now, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,</p>
<p>The mightiest of the storms hath ta’en his stand!</p>
<p>For here, not one, but many make their play,</p>
<p>And fling their thunderbolts from hand to hand,</p>
<p>Flashing and cast around! Of all the band,</p>
<p>The brightest through these parted hills hath forked</p>
<p>His lightnings,—as if he did understand,</p>
<p>That in such gaps as desolation worked,</p>
<p>There, the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.</p>

<p>恨深刻成渊，成对峙的两岸，</p>
<p>两座山再无重逢的可能，尽管肝肠寸断；</p>
<p>尽管各自的灵魂，为爱挫败伤痛，</p>
<p>皆因情重还斟情，爱极嫌隙生，</p>
<p>致使他们的生命之花枯萎，然后——永相别。</p>
<p>爱已成殇，恨却绵绵期不绝，</p>
<p>爱之花再无春暖，彼此的心灵长熬煎。</p>
<p>而今，奔腾的罗纳河已劈开通道，</p>
<p>大暴雨顺势注入其中！</p>
<p>因为这儿，一阵阵暴风雨戏耍峰峦</p>
<p>接连不断朝着高山投掷霹雳，</p>
<p>到处电闪雷鸣，大雨如注！一束</p>
<p>照彻天地的闪电，劈成几束</p>
<p>在四分五裂的山峦上炸裂，似乎他真的理解，</p>
<p>这样劈开荒芜的豁口，</p>
<p>无论其中有何诡秘，炽光都要把其炸裂。</p>

<p>ORIGIN OF PROPERTY</p>
<p>财产起源</p>
<p>Sir William Blackstone, 1723-1780, was the son of a silk merchant,
and was born in London. He studied with great success at Oxford, and was
admitted to the bar in 1745. At first he could not obtain business
enough in his profession to support himself, and for a time relinquished
practice, and lectured at Oxford. He afterwards returned to London, and
resumed his practice with great success, still continuing to lecture at
Oxford. He was elected to Parliament in 1761; and in 1770 was made a
justice of the Court of Common Pleas, which office he held till his
death. Blackstone’s fame rests upon his “Commentaries on the Laws of
England,” published about 1769. He was a man of great ability, sound
learning, unflagging industry, and moral integrity. His great work is
still a common text-book in the study of law.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the world, we are informed by Holy Writ, the all-
bountiful Creator gave to man dominion over all the earth, and “over the
fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth.” This is the only true and solid
foundation of man’s dominion over external things, whatever airy,
metaphysical notions may have been started by fanciful writers upon this
subject. The earth, therefore, and all things therein, are the general
property of all mankind, exclusive of other beings, from the immediate
gift of the Creator. And while the earth continued bare of inhabitants,
it is reasonable to suppose that all was in common among them, and that
everyone took from the public stock, to his own use, such things as his
immediate necessities required.</p>
<p>These general notions of property were then sufficient to answer all
the purposes of human life; and might, perhaps, still have answered
them, had it been possible for mankind to have remained in a state of
primeval simplicity, in which “all things were common to him.” Not that
this communion of goods seems ever to have been applicable, even in the
earliest ages, to aught but the substance of the thing; nor could it be
extended to the use of it. For, by the law of nature and reason, he who
first began to use it, acquired therein a kind of transient property,
that lasted so long as he was using it, and no longer. Or, to speak with
greater precision, the right of possession continued for the same time,
only, that the act of possession lasted.</p>
<p>Thus, the ground was in common, and no part of it was the permanent
property of any man in particular; yet, whoever was in the occupation of
any determined spot of it, for rest, for shade, or the like, acquired
for the time a sort of ownership, from which it would have been unjust
and contrary to the law of nature to have driven him by force; but, the
instant that he quitted the use or occupation of it, another might seize
it without injustice. Thus, also, a vine or other tree might be said to
be in common, as all men were equally entitled to its produce; and yet,
any private individual might gain the sole property of the fruit which
he had gathered for his own repast: a doctrine well illustrated by
Cicero, who compares the world to a great theater, which is common to
the public, and yet the place which any man has taken is, for the time,
his own.</p>
<p>But when mankind increased in number, craft, and ambition, it became
necessary to entertain conceptions of a more permanent dominion; and to
appropriate to individuals not the immediate use only, but the very
substance of the thing to be used. Otherwise, innumerable tumults must
have arisen, and the good order of the world been continually broken and
disturbed, while a variety of persons were striving who should get the
first occupation of the same thing, or disputing which of them had
actually gained it. As human life also grew more and more refined,
abundance of conveniences were devised to render it more easy,
commodious, and agreeable; as habitations for shelter and safety, and
raiment for warmth and decency. But no man would be at the trouble to
provide either, so long as he had only a usufructuary property in them,
which was to cease the instant that he quitted possession; if, as soon
as he walked out of his tent or pulled off his garment, the next
stranger who came by would have a right to inhabit the one and to wear
the other.</p>
<p>In the case of habitations, in particular, it was natural to observe
that even the brute creation, to whom everything else was in common,
maintained a kind of permanent property in their dwellings, especially
for the protection of their young; that the birds of the air had nests,
and the beasts of the fields had caverns, the invasion of which they
esteemed a very flagrant injustice, and would sacrifice their lives to
preserve them. Hence a property was soon established in every man’s
house and homestead; which seem to have been originally mere temporary
huts or movable cabins, suited to the design of Providence for more
speedily peopling the earth, and suited to the wandering life of their
owners, before any extensive property in the soil or ground was
established.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt but that movables of every kind became sooner
appropriated than the permanent, substantial soil; partly because they
were more susceptible of a long occupancy, which might be continue for
months together without any sensible interruption, and at length, by
usage, ripen into an established right; but, principally, because few of
them could be fit for use till improved and meliorated by the bodily
labor of the occupant; which bodily labor, bestowed upon any subject
which before lay in common to all men, is universally allowed to give
the fairest and most reasonable title to an exclusive property
therein.</p>
<p>The article of food was a more immediate call, and therefore a more
early consideration. Such as were not contented with the spontaneous
product of the earth, sought for a more solid refreshment in the flesh
of beasts, which they obtained by hunting. But the frequent
disappointments incident to that method of provision, induced them to
gather together such animals as were of a more tame and sequacious
nature and to establish themselves in a less precarious manner, partly
by the milk of the dams, and partly by the flesh of the young.</p>
<p>The support of these their cattle made the article of water also a
very important point. And, therefore, the book of Genesis, (the most
venerable monument of antiquity, considered merely with a view to
history,) will furnish us with frequent instances of violent contentions
concerning wells; the exclusive property of which appears to have been
established in the first digger or occupant, even in places where the
ground and herbage remained yet in common. Thus, we find Abraham, who
was but a sojourner, asserting his right to a well in the country of
Abimelech, and exacting an oath for his security “because he had digged
that well.” And Isaac, about ninety years afterwards, reclaimed this his
father’s property; and, after much contention with the Philistines, was
suffered to enjoy it in peace.</p>
<p>All this while, the soil and pasture of the earth remained still in
common as before, and open to every occupant; except, perhaps, in the
neighborhood of towns, where the necessity of a sale and exclusive
property in lands, (for the sake of agriculture,) was earlier felt, and
therefore more readily complied with. Otherwise, when the multitude of
men and cattle had consumed every convenience on one spot of ground, it
was deemed a natural right to seize upon and occupy such other lands as
would more easily supply their necessities.</p>
<p>We have a striking example of this in the history of Abraham and his
nephew Lot. When their joint substance became so great that pasture and
other conveniences grew scarce, the natural consequence was that a
strife arose between their servants; so that it was no longer
practicable to dwell together. This contention, Abraham thus endeavored
to compose: “Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee.
Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from
me. If thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if
thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.” This plainly
implies an acknowledged right in either to occupy whatever ground he
pleased that was not preoccupied by other tribes. “And Lot lifted up his
eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered
everywhere, even as the garden of the Lord. Then Lot chose him all the
plain of Jordan, and journeyed east; and Abraham dwelt in the land of
Canaan.”</p>
<p>As the world by degrees grew more populous, it daily became more
difficult to find out new spots to inhabit, without encroaching upon
former occupants; and, by constantly occupying the same individual spot,
the fruits of the earth were consumed, and its spontaneous products
destroyed without any provision for future supply or succession. It,
therefore, became necessary to pursue some regular method of providing a
constant subsistence; and this necessity produced, or at least promoted
and encouraged the art of agriculture. And the art of agriculture, by a
regular connection and consequence, introduced and established the idea
of a more permanent property in the soil than had hitherto been received
and adopted.</p>
<p>It was clear that the earth would not produce her fruits in
sufficient quantities without the assistance of tillage; but who would
be at the pains of tilling it, if another might watch an opportunity to
seize upon and enjoy the product of his industry, art and labor? Had
not, therefore, a separate property in lands, as well as movables, been
vested in some individuals, the world must have continued a forest, and
men have been mere animals of prey. Whereas, now, (so graciously has
Providence interwoven our duty and our happiness together,) the result
of this very necessity has been the ennobling of the human species, by
giving it opportunities of improving its rational, as well as of
exerting its natural faculties.</p>
<p>Necessity begat property; and, in order to insure that property,
recourse was had to civil society, which brought along with it a long
train of inseparable concomitants: states, government, laws,
punishments, and the public exercise of religious duties. Thus connected
together, it was found that a part only of society was sufficient to
provide, by their manual labor, for the necessary subsistence of all;
and leisure was given to others to cultivate the human mind, to invent
useful arts, and to lay the foundations of science.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-565">中文阅读</h4>
<p>我们从《圣经》里得知，创世之初，万物之主就给了人类支配地球财产之权利，统领“海中之游鱼，空中之飞鸟，以及行动于地球之上的所有生命个体”。此为人类支配外在财物之唯一真实可靠的基础，无论富于想象的作者如何为此大造文章，创造出各种幻想的、超自然的概念。因此，上帝所直接赐予的世间万物，皆为全人类共同的财产，这是其他生灵都没有的特权。当地球上继续有人类栖息时，就有理由相信万物属于所有人共有，每个人只要有现时的必需之物，就可以从公有的财产中拿取东西为自己使用。</p>
<p>这种关于财产的普遍观念足以应付人类生活的种种需要；或许是一直在满足人们的需要。对人类而言，保持一种原始的简单的状态是完全可能的，在此法则中“万物在上帝面前皆平等”。但这种财物共享的观念从来都不曾变为现实，甚至在世纪伊始就不适用，更别提如何应用到实际中了。因为，根据自然和理性法则，首先使用者就会获得了某种暂时性使用权，只要他一直使用这项物品，就一直拥有这项权利，直到他不用为止。或者更精确地说，只要他一直占有该物品，就一直享有该物品的所有权。</p>
<p>因此，土地是公共的，任何人都没有永久占有部分土地的特权；然而总会有人出于种种理由占有——为休息、为遮阴或是为了喜好，暂时获得了一片土地的所有权，这种不合理而违背自然法的行为就要用武力驱逐之。然而，即便他放弃使用或占有权，就可能另有人非合理地夺取。因此，一架葡萄、另一棵树也可以说成是公共财物，因为所有人都有等同的资格享用其果实，但任何一个采集水果充饥的人都可以获得水果唯一的享用权。西塞罗用插图阐释过一个很棒的学说，他把世界比作一个大剧院，剧院属于大众，然而任何人一旦有机会，都可以占用一段时间。</p>
<p>但是当人类数量增多、技艺增强、野心变大，必然就想要获得对物品更长远的支配权，这对个人来说不止是物品的直接使用权，还有它的实质拥有权。否则，必然会引发数不清的骚乱，世界的良好秩序亦被不断的打乱与干扰，而各色人等则拼命争夺同一物品的首先使用权，或是为谁实际已有所有权争执不下。此时，随着人类生活质量越来越好，便利性设施也丰富多样，使得生活越发方便、舒适、令人愉快。人们居有定所，安全可靠，衣服温暖又十分体面。但是没有人愿意费神提供物品或住所，只要人们拥有财产使用权——而所有权终止时亦会连同使用权一并丧失；也就是说他一走出他的帐篷或脱掉衣服，路过的陌生人就有权住进去，并将别人的衣服穿上。</p>
<p>特别是居所，显而易见，即便是认为一切财物都是共有的野蛮人，住所也是他们永久持有的财产，尤其是这住所能给他们的后代提供保护。即便在他们的眼中，飞鸟栖息于巢，走兽安居于穴，入侵谁的住所都是极不道德行为，他们会牺牲生命，誓死捍卫家园。因此每个人的住房和宅基很快建立了所有权，在土地上大量的房产所有权建立之前，这种所有权最初的形式似乎是临时搭建的棚子以及可移动的小屋，这些棚子和小屋乃是上帝为了人们更加快捷地在地上居住而设计，适合屋主过流浪的生活。</p>
<p>毫无疑问，对每种可移动产的占有要比对恒定不变的土地更为迅速，部分原因是可移动产更容易让人们长久占有，人们可能持有数月却没有得到任何阻碍，而最终通过使用形成了一种既定的权利。但主要原因在于，可移动产几乎不能使用，需要占有者通过亲身劳动将其提高改良，而普遍得到认可的是，通过亲身劳动，可以把原来属于人类的共有财产变为专有财产，这是最为公正而无可厚非的权益。</p>
<p>而食物是更直接的号召，因此也是最先考虑的事情。例如人们不满足于大自然天然产物，于是他们捕猎野兽，从猎获的野兽肉中寻找更能恢复精力的东西。但是随着那种食物供应不能满足需要，诱使他们将比较驯服易于管理的动物聚在一起，用比较安全持久的方式供养自己，一部分食物源自畜养栏里动物的乳汁，一部分来自小动物的鲜肉。</p>
<p>圈养家畜又带来饮水紧缺。因此，《起源论》给我们提供了因争夺水井而频繁发生的暴力事例，甚至在那些土地和牧草共有的地方，第一个挖掘者或是占有者就已经建立他的专有财产权。由此我们发现，亚伯拉罕仅是位旅居者，却在亚米比勒的家乡声称他有一口井的所有权，而且以他的人身安全赌咒发誓“他挖了那口井”。而大约九十年后，以撒收回了他父亲对这口井的所有权，经过多次与非利士人的争议之后，得以和平享用井水。</p>
<p>一直以来，土地和大地上的牧草和以前一样为共有财产，敞开怀抱供养每一个占有者。或许不应该包括城镇的附近地区，那儿出售着必需品和专有权的转让，很早就有了这种交易现象，因此更利于执行。否则当大量的人和家畜在土地上的一个地点消耗了所有便利品时，将抢占其他土地更便于给他们提供所需看作是一种天然的权利。</p>
<p>我在亚伯拉罕和他的侄子洛特的历史纷争中看到一个惊人的例子。他们共同的资产那么庞大，以至于牧草和其他便利日益匮乏，自然而然他们的仆人之间引发了斗争，如此一来居住一起就行不通了。亚伯拉罕努力平息这场斗争：“我恳求你，我和你，让这儿保持和平。整个土地不是就在你面前吗？我恳请你，我们分开居住。如果你接受左边的土地，那我就去右边，若你起身去右边，我就去左边。”这句话明示给他，只要不是被其他部落占有的，他高兴要哪块土地就要哪块的权利。“洛特抬起眼皮，看着约旦的整个平原，充足的水源灌溉着每一片肥沃的草地，堪比伊甸园。于是洛特选择了约旦的整个平原，朝东迁移，亚伯拉罕就在迦南的土地上住下来。”</p>
<p>随着世界人口密度越来越高，找到新的居住地点变得日益困难，因而就不得不侵占前者的居住空间，通过不断地占有同一个体的地方，地里的成果被消耗殆尽，自然产物被破坏却没有为下个季节做任何储蓄以备需求。因此寻求一些规律化持续提供物质的方法成了当务之急。而且这种必要性产生了农业艺术，或者说起码是催化了农艺的前进。而农艺通过一种规律性连接得到的结果，要比迄今为止接受和采纳的方法更有利于引进和建立土地产生更持久的财产这一观念。</p>
<p>显然，土地不借助于耕种，就不会长出足够的粮食作物。但是倘若另一个人瞅到机会就占为己有，享用他人的劳动艺术成果，那么谁愿意辛苦耕种呢？所以土地以及可移动产必须授予个人专属权，否则这个世界必定永远被森林占据，而人类仅能靠捕猎为食。鉴于此，这种特有的结果是人类通过赋予土地合理利用以及发挥其自然能力的时机，成了地球上高贵的物种。</p>
<p>人类相互的需要引发所有权问题，为了确保财产，就必须求助于民权社会，随之就衍生一系列不可分割的伴随体：国家、政府、法律、惩罚以及公开执行的宗教义务。因此，把这些伴随体联系起来，你就会发现，社会通过一部分人手工劳动，就足够为全人类提供生活所需物资，而其他人腾出的时间用来陶冶人类心智，创造有用的艺术，为科学世界奠定基础。</p>

<p>“WITH BRAINS, SIR”</p>
<p>“动动脑筋，阁下”</p>
<p>John Brown, 1810-1882, was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland, and
graduated at the University of Edinburgh. His father was John Brown, an
eminent clergyman and the author of several books. Dr. Brown’s literary
reputation rests largely upon a series of papers contributed to the
“North British Review.” “Rab and his Friends,” a collection of papers
published in book form, is the most widely known of all his
writings.</p>
<p>“Pray, Mr. Opie, may I ask you what you mix your colors with?” said a
brisk dilettante student to the great painter. “With brains, sir,” was
the gruff reply—and the right one. It did not give much of information;
it did not expound the principles and rules of the art; but, if the
inquirer had the commodity referred to, it would awaken him; it would
set him agoing, athinking, and a-painting to good purpose. If he had not
the wherewithal, as was likely enough, the less he had to do with colors
and their mixture the better.</p>
<p>Many other artists, when asked such a question, would have either set
about detailing the mechanical composition of such and such colors, in
such and such proportions, rubbed up so and so; or perhaps they would
(and so much the better, but not the best) have shown him how they laid
them on; but even this would leave him at the critical point. Opie
preferred going to the quick and the heart of the matter: “With brains,
sir.”</p>
<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds was taken by a friend to see a picture. He was
anxious to admire it, and he looked it over with a keen and careful but
favorable eye. “Capital composition; correct drawing; the color, tone,
chiaroscuro excellent; but—but—it wants—hang it, it wants—that!”
snapping his fingers; and, wanting “that,” though it had everything
else, it was worth nothing.</p>
<p>Again, Etty was appointed teacher of the students of the Royal
Academy, having been preceded by a clever, talkative, scientific
expounder of aesthetics, who delighted to tell the young men how
everything was done, how to copy this, and how to express that. A
student came up to the new master, “How should I do this, sir?” “Suppose
you try.” Another, “What does this mean, Mr. Etty?” “Suppose you look.”
“But I have looked.” “Suppose you look again.”</p>
<p>And they did try, and they did look, and looked again; and they saw
and achieved what they never could have done had the how or the what
(supposing this possible, which it is not, in full and highest meaning)
been told them, or done for them; in the one case, sight and action were
immediate, exact, intense, and secure; in the other, mediate, feeble,
and lost as soon as gained.</p>

<p>“求您了，奥佩先生，我可以问问您是怎么调色的吗？”一位活泼的业余人士对大画家说。“动动脑筋，阁下”是一句粗暴的答复，但却是正确的答复。这句答复没有多少知识信息，没有对艺术原理和规则做详细说明。但是，如果询问者把绘画当作商品，那么这句话就会让他警醒，让他重新思考，重新认识一幅画的意义。若他不把绘画换钱，那么很有可能他越是不在意绘画价格，着色和调色就越好。</p>
<p>其他的很多艺术家，被问及同一个问题时，要么就详述色彩的力学合成原理，细说调色比例，一遍遍温习；要么，他们会给询问者亲自演示如何铺陈渲染，但是即便如此指点，他还是忽略了最关键的一点。而奥佩更喜欢直抵核心问题：“动动脑筋，阁下。”</p>
<p>乔休尔·雷诺兹先生的一位朋友邀请他鉴赏一幅画作。他冲口而出一声赞美，用赞许的眼神热切认真地反复端详。“布局完美，运笔恰当，着色匀致，明暗搭配极佳，但是——但是——画要挂起来——挂起来看才好，它需要——那样！”他打了个响指，要“挂起来才好”，意味着即使他说这幅画完美无缺，其实却不值一文。</p>
<p>艾逖再次受命任皇家学院的老师，他是个聪明健谈的美学的系统阐释者，他很乐于给年轻人讲授如何做事，如何复制美，如何表达美。一位学生走到新任老师跟前，“我应该怎样做到这一步呢？先生？”“你尝试一下吧。”另一个学生问：“艾逖先生，这是什么意思呢？”“你看看吧。”“可我已经看了。”“那你再看看。”</p>
<p>他们确实尝试了，也的确看了又看，但是他们发现永远不可能按照老师所教授的来做（假设可以达到这种完美和最高意境可能性——而实际上是无法达到的）。你所看到的景象与行动是直观、准确、强烈而稳妥的；而与此同时，在你记住它们之时即刻就变得间接、无效而失去踪影。</p>

<p>THE NEW ENGLAND PASTOR</p>
<p>新英格兰牧师</p>
<p>Timothy Dwight, 1752-1817, was born at Northampton, Massachusetts.
His mother was a daughter of the celebrated Jonathan Edwards. It is said
that she taught her son the alphabet in one lesson, that he could read
the Bible at four years of age, and that he studied Latin by himself at
six. He graduated at Yale in 1769, returned as tutor in 1771, and
continued six years. He was chaplain in a brigade under General Putnam
for a time. In 1778 his father died, and for five years he supported his
mother and a family of twelve children by farming, teaching and
preaching. From 1783 to 1795 he was pastor at Greenfield, Connecticut.
He was then chosen President of Yale College, and remained in office
till he died. Dr. Dwight was a man of fine bodily presence, of extended
learning, and untiring industry. His presidency of the college was
highly successful. His patriotism was no less ardent and true than his
piety. In his younger days he wrote considerably in verse. His poetry is
not all of a very high order, but some pieces possess merit.</p>
<p>The place, with east and western sides,</p>
<p>A wide and verdant street divides:</p>
<p>And here the houses faced the day,</p>

<p>A neat and solemn house of God.</p>

<p>DEATH OF ABSALOM</p>
<p>押沙龙之死</p>
<p>David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of
thousands and captains of hundreds over them. And David sent forth a
third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under
the hand of Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third
part under the hand of Ittai, the Gittite.</p>
<p>And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you
myself also. But the people answered, thou shalt not go forth; for if we
flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will
they care for us; but now thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore
now it is better that thou succor us out of the city. And the king said
unto them, What seemeth you best, I will do.</p>
<p>And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by
hundreds and by thousands. And the king commanded Joab, and Abishai, and
Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with
Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains
charge concerning Absalom.</p>
<p>So the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle
was in the wood of Ephraim; where the people of Israel were slain before
the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of
twenty thousand men. For the battle was there scattered over the face of
all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the
sword devoured.</p>
<p>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule,
and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head
caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the
earth; and the mule that was under him went away.</p>
<p>And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
Absalom hanged in an oak. And Joab said unto the man that told him, And,
behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the
ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle.
And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels
of silver in my hand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the
king’s son; for, in our hearing, the king charged thee, and Abishai, and
Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. Otherwise,
I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life; for there is no
matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldst have set thyself
against me.</p>
<p>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three
darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while
he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. And ten young men that bare
Joab’s armor, compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. And Joab
blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel;
for Joab held back the people.</p>
<p>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and
laid a very great heap of stones upon him; and all Israel fled, everyone
to his tent. Now Absalom, in his lifetime, had taken and reared up for
himself a pillar, which is in the king’s dale; for he said, I have no
son to keep my name in remembrance; and he called the pillar after his
own name; and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s Place.</p>
<p>Then said Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the
king tidings, how that the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies. And
Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt
bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings,
because the king’s son is dead. Then said Joab to Cushi, Go, tell the
king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and
ran.</p>
<p>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever,
let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt
thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? But howsoever,
said he, let me run. And he said unto him, run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the
way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</p>
<p>And David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the
roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked,
and behold, a man running alone. And the watchman cried, and told the
king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth.
And he came apace, and drew near.</p>
<p>And the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called
unto the porter, and said, Behold, another man running alone. And the
king said, He also bringeth tidings. And the watchman said, Methinketh
the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of
Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good
tidings.</p>
<p>And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell
down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be
the Lord thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their
hand against my lord the king. And the king said, Is the young man
Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant,
and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.
And the king said unto him, Turn aside and stand here. And he turned
aside, and stood still.</p>
<p>And behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings my lord the king; for
the Lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against
thee. And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And
Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise
against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.</p>
<p>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the
gate, and wept; and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom! my son,
my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my
son!</p>

<p>大卫数点跟随他的人，立千夫长百夫长率领他们。大卫打发军兵出战，分为三队，一队在约押手下，一队在洗鲁雅的儿子约押兄弟亚比筛手下，一队在迦特人以太手下。</p>
<p>大卫对军兵说，我必与你们一同出战。军兵却说，你不可出战，若是我们逃跑，敌人必不介意。我们阵亡一半，敌人也不介意。因为你一人强似我们万人。你不如在城里预备帮助我们。王向他们说，你们以为怎样好，我就怎样行。</p>
<p>于是王站在城门旁，军兵或百或千的挨次出去了。王嘱咐约押，亚比筛，以太说，你们要为我的缘故，宽待那少年人押沙龙。王为押沙龙嘱咐众将的话，兵都听见了。</p>
<p>兵就出到田野迎着以色列人，在以法莲树林里交战。以色列人败在大卫的仆人面前。那日阵亡的甚多，共有二万人。因为在那里四面打仗。死于树林的，比死于刀剑的更多。</p>
<p>押沙龙偶然遇见大卫的仆人。押沙龙骑着骡子，从大橡树密枝底下经过，他的头发被树枝绕住，就悬挂起来。所骑的骡子便离他去了。</p>
<p>有个人看见，就告诉约押说，我看见押沙龙挂在橡树上了。约押对报信的人说，你既看见他，为什么不将他打死，落在地上呢。你若打死他，我就赏你十舍客勒银子、一条带子。那人对约押说，我就是得你一千舍客勒银子，我也不敢伸手害王的儿子。因为我们听见王嘱咐你和亚比筛并以太说，你们要谨慎，不可害那少年人押沙龙。我若妄为害了他的性命，就是你自己也必与我为敌。原来无论何事，都瞒不过王。</p>
<p>约押说，我不能与你逗留。约押手拿三杆短枪，趁押沙龙在橡树上还活着，就刺透他的心。给约押拿兵器的十个少年人围绕押沙龙，将他杀死。约押吹角，拦阻众人，他们就回来，不再追赶以色列人。</p>
<p>他们将押沙龙丢在林中一个大坑里，上头堆起一大堆石头。以色列众人都逃跑，各回各家去了。押沙龙活着的时候，在王谷立了一根石柱。因他说，我没有儿子为我留名。他就以自己的名，称那石柱，叫押沙龙柱，直到今日。</p>
<p>撒督的儿子亚希玛斯说，容我跑去，将耶和华向仇敌给王报仇的信息报与王知。约押对他说，你今日不可去报信，改日可以报信，因为今日王的儿子死了，所以你不可去报信。</p>
<p>约押对古示人说，你去将你所看见的告诉王。古示人在约押面前下拜，就跑去了。</p>
<p>撒督的儿子亚希玛斯又对约押说，无论怎样，求你容我随着古示人跑去。约押说，我儿，你报这信息，既不得赏赐，何必要跑去呢。他又说，无论怎样，我要跑去。约押说，你跑去吧。亚希玛斯就从平原往前跑，跑过古示人去了。</p>
<p>大卫正坐在城瓮里。守望的人上城门楼的顶上，举目观看，见有一个人独自跑来。守望的人就大声告诉王。王说，他若独自来，必是报口信的。那人跑得渐渐近了。</p>
<p>守望的人又见一人跑来，就对守城门的人说，又有一人独自跑来。王说，这也必是报信的。守望的人说，我看前头人的跑法好像撒督的儿子亚希玛斯的跑法一样。王说，他是个好人，必是报好信息。</p>
<p>亚希玛斯向王呼叫，说，平安了。就在王面前脸伏于地，叩拜，说，耶和华你的神是应当称颂的，因他已将那举手攻击我主我王的人交给王了。王问说，少年人押沙龙平安不平安。亚希玛斯回答说，约押打发王的仆人，那时仆人听见众民大声喧哗，却不知道是什么事。王说，你退去，站在旁边。他就退去，站在旁边。</p>
<p>古示人也来到，说，有信息报给我主我王。耶和华今日向一切兴起攻击你的人给你报仇了。王问古示人说，少年人押沙龙平安不平安。古示人回答说，愿我主我王的仇敌，和一切兴起要杀害你的人，都与那少年人一样。</p>
<p>王就心里伤恸，上城门楼去哀哭，一面走，一面说，我儿押沙龙阿，我儿，我儿押沙龙阿。我恨不得替你死。押沙龙阿，我儿，我儿。</p>

<p>亚伯拉罕·达文波特</p>
<p>’T was on a May day of the far old year</p>
<p>Seventeen hundred eighty, that there fell</p>
<p>Over the bloom and sweet life of the Spring,</p>
<p>Over the fresh earth and the heaven of noon,</p>
<p>A horror of great darkness, like the night</p>
<p>In day of which the Norland sagas tell,</p>
<p>The Twilight of the Gods.</p>
<p>The low-hung sky</p>
<p>Was black with ominous clouds, save where its rim</p>
<p>Was fringed with a dull glow, like that which climbs</p>
<p>The crater’s sides from the red hell below.</p>
<p>Birds ceased to sing, and all the barnyard fowls</p>
<p>Roosted; the cattle at the pasture bars</p>
<p>Lowed, and looked homeward; bats on leathern wings</p>
<p>Flitted abroad; the sounds of labor died;</p>
<p>Men prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp</p>
<p>To hear the doom blast of the trumpet shatter</p>
<p>The black sky, that the dreadful face of Christ</p>
<p>Might look from the rent clouds, not as he looked</p>
<p>A loving guest at Bethany, but stern</p>
<p>As Justice and inexorable Law.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the old Statehouse, dim as ghosts,</p>
<p>Sat the lawgivers of Connecticut,</p>
<p>Trembling beneath their legislative robes.</p>
<p>“It is the Lord’s Great Day! Let us adjourn,”</p>
<p>Some said; and then, as if with one accord,</p>
<p>All eyes were turned to Abraham Davenport.</p>
<p>He rose, slow-cleaving with his steady voice</p>
<p>The intolerable hush. “This well may be</p>
<p>The Day of Judgment which the world awaits;</p>
<p>But be it so or not, I only know</p>
<p>My present duty, and my Lord’s command</p>
<p>To occupy till he come. So at the post</p>
<p>Where he hath set me in his providence,</p>
<p>I choose, for one, to meet him face to face,</p>
<p>No faithless servant frightened from my task,</p>
<p>But ready when the Lord of the harvest calls;</p>
<p>And therefore, with all reverence, I would say,</p>
<p>Let God do his work, we will see to ours.</p>
<p>Bring in the candles.” And they brought them in.</p>
<p>Then by the flaring lights the Speaker read,</p>
<p>Albeit with husky voice and shaking hands,</p>
<p>An act to amend an act to regulate</p>
<p>The shad and alewive fisheries. Whereupon,</p>
<p>Wisely and well spake Abraham Davenport,</p>
<p>Straight to the question, with no figures of speech</p>
<p>Save the ten Arab signs, yet not without</p>
<p>The shrewd, dry humor natural to the man:</p>
<p>His awe-struck colleagues listening all the while,</p>
<p>Between the pauses of his argument,</p>
<p>To hear the thunder of the wrath of God</p>
<p>Break from the hollow trumpet of the cloud.</p>
<p>And there he stands in memory to this day,</p>
<p>Erect, self-poised, a rugged face, half seen</p>
<p>Against the background of unnatural dark,</p>
<p>A witness to the ages as they pass,</p>
<p>That simple duty hath no place for fear.</p>

<p>THE FALLS OF THE YOSEMITE</p>
<p>约塞米蒂大瀑布</p>
<p>Thomas Starr King, 1824-1863, was born in New York City. His father
was a Universalist minister; and, in 1834, he settled in Charlestown,
Massachusetts. The son was preparing to enter Harvard University, when
the death of his father devolved upon him the support of his mother, and
his collegiate course had to be given up. He spent several years as
clerk and teacher, improving meanwhile all possible opportunities for
study. In 1846 he was settled over the church to which his father had
preached in Charlestown. Two years later, he was called to the Hollis
Street Unitarian Church in Boston. Here his eloquence and active public
spirit soon made him well known. He also gained much reputation as a
public lecturer. In 1860 he left the East to take charge of the
Unitarian church in San Francisco. During the remaining years of his
life, he exercised much influence in the public affairs of California.
He died suddenly, of diphtheria, in the midst of his brilliant
career.</p>
<p>Mr. King was a great lover of nature. His “White Hills,” describing
the mountain scenery of New Hampshire, is the most complete book ever
written concerning that interesting region.</p>
<p>The Yosemite valley, in California, is a pass about ten miles long.
At its eastern extremity it leads into three narrower passes, each of
which extends several miles, winding by the wildest paths into the heart
of the Sierra Nevada chain of mountains. For seven miles of the main
valley, which varies in width from three quarters of a mile to a mile
and a half, the walls on either side are from two thousand to nearly
five thousand feet above the road, and are nearly perpendicular. From
these walls, rocky splinters a thousand feet in height start up, and
every winter drop a few hundred tons of granite, to adorn the base of
the rampart with picturesque ruin.</p>
<p>The valley is of such irregular width, and bends so much and often so
abruptly, that there is a great variety and frequent surprise in the
forms and combinations of the overhanging rocks as one rides along the
bank of the stream. The patches of luxuriant meadow, with their dazzling
green, and the grouping of the superb firs, two hundred feet high, that
skirt them, and that shoot above the stout and graceful oaks and
sycamores through which the horse path winds, are delightful rests of
sweetness and beauty amid the threatening awfulness.</p>
<p>The Merced, which flows through the same pass, is a noble stream, a
hundred feet wide and ten feet deep. It is formed chiefly of the streams
that leap and rush through the narrower passes, and it is swollen, also,
by the bounty of the marvelous waterfalls that pour down from the
ramparts of the wider valley. The sublime poetry of Habakkuk is needed
to describe the impression, and, perhaps, the geology, of these mighty
fissures: “Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.”</p>
<p>At the foot of the breakneck declivity of nearly three thousand feet
by which we reach the banks of the Merced, we are six miles from the
hotel, and every rod of the ride awakens wonder, awe, and a solemn joy.
As we approach the hotel, and turn toward the opposite bank of the
river, what is that</p>
<p>“Which ever sounds and shines,</p>
<p>A pillar of white light upon the wall</p>
<p>Of purple cliffs aloof descried”?</p>
<p>That, reader, is the highest waterfall in the world—the Yosemite
cataract, nearly twenty-five hundred feet in its plunge, dashing from a
break or depression in a cliff thirty-two hundred feet sheer.</p>
<p>A writer who visited this valley in September, calls the cataract a
mere tape line of water dropped from the sky. Perhaps it is so, toward
the close of the dry season; but as we saw it, the blended majesty and
beauty of it, apart from the general sublimities of Yosemite gorge,
would repay a journey of a thousand miles. There was no deficiency of
water. It was a powerful stream, thirty-five feet broad, fresh from the
Nevada, that made the plunge from the brow of the awful precipice.</p>
<p>At the first leap it clears fourteen hundred and ninety-seven feet;
then it tumbles down a series of steep stairways four hundred and two
feet, and then makes a jump to the meadows five hundred and eighteen
feet more. But it is the upper and highest cataract that is most
wonderful to the eye, as well as most musical. The cliff is so sheer
that there is no break in the body of the water during the whole of its
descent of more than a quarter of a mile. It pours in a curve from the
summit, fifteen hundred feet, to the basin that hoards it but a moment
for the cascades that follow.</p>
<p>And what endless complexities and opulence of beauty in the forms and
motions of the cataract! It is comparatively narrow at the top of the
precipice, although, as we said, the tide that pours over is thirty-five
feet broad. But it widens as it descends, and curves a little on one
side as it widens, so that it shapes itself, before it reaches its first
bowl of granite, into the figure of a comet. More beautiful than the
comet, however, we can see the substance of this watery loveliness ever
renew itself and ever pour itself away.</p>
<p>“It mounts in spray the skies, and thence again</p>
<p>Returns in an unceasing shower, which round</p>
<p>With its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,</p>
<p>Is an eternal April to the ground,</p>
<p>Making it all one emerald; —how profound</p>
<p>The gulf! and how the giant element</p>
<p>From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,</p>
<p>Crushing the cliffs.”</p>
<p>The cataract seems to shoot out a thousand serpentine heads or knots
of water, which wriggle down deliberately through the air and expend
themselves in mist before half the descent is over. Then a new set burst
from the body and sides of the fall, with the same fortune on the
remaining distance; and thus the most charming fretwork of watery
nodules, each trailing its vapory train for a hundred feet or more, is
woven all over the cascade, which swings, now and then, thirty feet each
way, on the mountain side, as if it were a pendulum of watery lace. Once
in a while, too, the wind manages to get back of the fall, between it
and the cliff, and then it will whirl it round and round for two or
three hundred feet, as if to try the experiment of twisting it to wring
it dry.</p>
<p>Of course I visited the foot of the lowest fall of the Yosemite, and
looked up through the spray, five hundred feet, to its crown. And I
tried to climb to the base of the first or highest cataract, but lost my
way among the steep, sharp rocks, for there is only one line by which
the cliff can be scaled. But no nearer view that I found or heard
described, is comparable with the picture, from the hotel, of the comet
curve of the upper cataract, fifteen hundred feet high, and the two
falls immediately beneath it, in which the same water leaps to the level
of the quiet Merced.</p>

<p>那流经同一条通道的莫赛德河，是一条庄严的溪流，其宽达十英尺，水深三英尺。这条河主要是由纵横交错的溪流汇聚而成，而从那宽阔峡谷壁垒上直泻而下的瀑布，也赐予了莫赛德河涨涌的水流。先知哈巴谷的庄严诗句或许能描述出这种感觉，或者还能说明这些巨大沟壑的结构：“你用河流，劈开大地。”</p>
<p>我们从将近三千英尺的险峻山坡脚下走过，来到莫塞德河的岸边，这儿距我们下榻之地约有六英里，沿途的每一段路程都让我们惊奇、敬畏，一种庄严的欢愉之情油然而生。当我们离旅馆越来越近时，蓦然回首河对岸，那是怎样的景观啊？</p>
<p>“流水潺湲，波光闪烁，</p>
<p>一条白色光柱，</p>
<p>笼罩着紫色的巉岩峭壁。”</p>
<p>诸位读者，那可是世界最高的瀑布——约塞米蒂大瀑布，瀑布急转处差不多有二千五百英尺宽，从三千二百英尺高的巉岩的裂口处直泻而下。</p>
<p>一位九月游览峡谷的作者说，大瀑布仅如一条水线垂挂空中。那或许是赶上枯水季节的缘故；而当时我们看见的大瀑布，与笼罩约塞米蒂峡谷的那种庄严不同，它集雄伟与壮美于一身，绝对不枉千里迢迢一睹其风采的劳顿。此时水源充沛，溪水源源不竭，溪涧宽三十五英尺，清澈的溪水来自内华达山，那是飞流从高峻的断崖跳入了溪涧之中。</p>
<p>约塞米蒂大瀑布由三段相互衔接的瀑布组成。它从一千五百英尺高的山崖上一跃而下；继而从一系列峭壁石梯上翻滚下落四百零二英尺，最后飞湍直下五百八十多英尺流到草地上。大瀑布是北美洲瀑布之最高，气势磅礴，叹为观止；瀑布轰鸣，宛如天籁。绝壁笔陡，长达四分之一英里的瀑布飞流直下的整个过程中没有一处停歇。它抛出一道弧线，从一千五百英尺的顶端飞落，直抵积水盆地，瞬间形成小瀑布倾泻而下。</p>
<p>奔腾而下的大瀑布，变幻无穷，美不胜收！尽管瀑布是从只有三十五英尺宽的悬崖顶上开始往下奔流，但是越往下奔流瀑布愈宽，瀑流的一侧随着增宽成曲线泻下，于是瀑布直抵第一块花岗岩水池前，其飞落的姿态如彗星。然它要比彗星更美，我们看到的是实实在在的水流，它的美丽永远自我再生、不断倾注。</p>
<p>“飞溅九霄，又折回</p>
<p>像个不停喷水的花洒，圆圆的</p>
<p>伴着阵雨过后的轻云，</p>
<p>于大地如永恒的四月芳菲，</p>
<p>使得大地绿如翡翠；这漩涡</p>
<p>多么深远！这庞然大物</p>
<p>如惊世狂花，飞跃一块块岩石，</p>
<p>征服一个个悬崖。”</p>
<p>大瀑布似乎喷射出了无数水柱和水浪，它们从容不迫地从空中蜿蜒而下，行至半途已是如霰如雾。接着从瀑布内和两侧爆发出新的水柱和水浪，以同样的运势接续余下的路程；于是水珠汇成了每一幅令人惊奇的精致浮雕图案，拖着一百英尺水雾迷蒙的长尾，汇入小瀑流中，又不时地摆动，每次在山的一侧都扬起三十英尺高的水柱，宛若一条摇曳的水带。间或劲风狂吹，使瀑布倒流，在瀑布和峭壁之间，风会将瀑布一圈又一圈旋起至二百到三百英尺高的水柱，仿佛在做瀑布拧绞甩干的试验。</p>
<p>当然，我是站在约塞米蒂最低的瀑布脚下观看，透过水雾仰望，五百英尺的高处就是瀑布的王冠。我企图爬上第一条大瀑布的基底或是至高点，可惜在峭壁巉岩间迷路，因为只有一条道路可以攀上悬崖。但从下榻的旅馆所见之景中，我并未发现、亦未曾听闻哪处景观堪与这幅画面相比：上面高达一千五百英尺的大瀑布抛出彗星般的曲线，其下方另有两条瀑布飞湍直下，这些同源之水便跃入了平静的莫赛德河中。</p>

<p>FRANKLIN’s ENTRY INTO PHILADELPHIA</p>
<p>富兰克林入费城</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin, 1706-1790, was born in Boston. He received little
schooling, but being apprenticed to his brother, a printer, he acquired
a taste for reading and study. In 1723, he went to Philadelphia, where
he followed his chosen calling, and in time became the publisher of the
“Pennsylvania Gazette” and the celebrated “Poor Richard’s Almanac.”</p>
<p>As a philosopher Franklin was rendered famous by his discovery of the
identity of lightning with electricity. His career in public affairs may
be briefly summarized as follows: In 1736 he was made Clerk of the
Provincial Assembly; in 1737, deputy postmaster at Philadelphia; and in
1753, Postmaster general for British America. He was twice in England as
the agent of certain colonies. After signing the Declaration of
Independence, he was sent as Minister Plenipotentiary to France in 1776.
On his return, in 1785, he was made “President of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania,” holding the office three years. He was also one of the
framers of the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>As a writer Franklin commenced his career when only twelve years old
by composing two ballads, which, however, he condemned as “wretched
stuff.” Franklin’s letters and papers on electricity, afterwards
enlarged by essays on various philosophical subjects, have been
translated into Latin, French, Italian, and German. The most noted of
his works, and the one from which the following extract is taken, is his
“Autobiography.” This book is “one of the half dozen most widely popular
books ever printed,” and has been published in nearly every written
language. Franklin founded the American Philosophical Society, and
established an institution which has since grown into the University of
Pennsylvania. His life is a noble example of the results of industry and
perseverance, and his death was the occasion of public mourning.</p>
<p>Walking in the evening by the side of the river, a boat came by,
which I found was going towards Philadelphia, with several people in
her. They took me in, and, as there was no wind, we rowed all the way;
and about midnight, not having yet seen the city, some of the company
were confident we must have passed it, and would row no farther; the
others knew not where we were; so we put toward the shore, got into a
creek, landed near an old fence, with the rails of which we made a fire,
the night being cold, in October, and there we remained till
daylight.</p>
<p>Then one of the company knew the place to be Cooper’s Creek, a little
above Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek, and
arrived there about eight or nine o’clock on the Sunday morning, and
landed at the Market Street wharf.</p>
<p>I have been the more particular in this description of my journey,
and shall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may in your
mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since made
there.</p>
<p>I was in my working dress, my best clothes being to come round by
sea. I was dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuffed out with
shirts and stockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for lodging.
I was fatigued with traveling, rowing, and want of rest; I was very
hungry; and my whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar, and
about a shilling in copper. The latter I gave the people of the boat for
my passage, who at first refused it on account of my rowing; but I
insisted on their taking it, —a man being sometimes more generous when
he has but a little money than when he has plenty, perhaps through fear
of being thought to have but little.</p>
<p>Then I walked up the street gazing about, till, near the market
house, I met a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on bread, and,
inquiring where he got it, I went immediately to the baker’s he directed
me to, in Second Street, and asked for biscuit, intending such as we had
in Boston: but they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then I
asked for a threepenny loaf, and was told they had none such. So not
considering or knowing the difference of money, and the greater
cheapness nor the names of his bread, I bade him give threepenny worth
of any sort. He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy rolls. I was
surprised at the quantity, but took it, and, having no room in my
pockets, walked off with a roll under each arm, and eating the
other.</p>
<p>Thus I went up Market Street as far as Fourth Street, passing by the
door of Mr. Read, my future wife’s father: when she, standing at the
door, saw me, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward,
ridiculous appearance. Then I turned and went down Chestnut Street and
part of Walnut Street, eating my roll all the way, and, coming round,
found myself again at Market Street wharf, near the boat I came in, to
which I went for a draught of the river water; and, being filled with
one of my rolls, gave the other two to a woman and her child that came
down the river in the boat with us, and were waiting to go farther.</p>
<p>Thus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time had
many clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way. I
joined them, and thereby was led into the great meetinghouse of the
Quakers, near the market. I sat down among them, and, after looking
round awhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy through labor
and want of rest the preceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continued
so till the meeting broke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me. This
was, therefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Walking down again toward the river, and looking in the faces of
people, I met a young Quaker man, whose countenance I liked, and,
accosting him, requested he would tell me where a stranger could get
lodging. We were then near the sign of the Three Mariners. “Here,” says
he, “is one place that entertains strangers, but it is not a reputable
house; if thee wilt walk with me, I’ll show thee a better.” He brought
me to the Crooked Billet, in Water Street. Here I got a dinner; and,
while I was eating it, several sly questions were asked me, as it seemed
to be suspected from my youth and appearance that I might be some
runaway. After dinner my sleepiness returned, and, being shown to a bed,
I lay down without undressing, and slept till six in the evening; was
called to supper, went to bed again very early, and slept soundly till
next morning.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-573">中文阅读</h4>
<p>夜晚走在河畔，一条船经过，我发现船上载着几个人，船是驶往费城的。这条船捎带上了我，此时无风，船无法借风力，这一路我们只好划船；大概划了半夜，依然看不到费城的影子，一些同伴言之凿凿地说我们必是错过了，因而就不再往前走；其他人也不知我们这是在哪儿；所以我们向岸边划去，拐进一条小河，然后在一围旧栅栏附近上了岸。十月的夜晚十分寒冷，于是我们抽出几根栅栏点火取暖，烤着火挨到天亮。</p>
<p>然后一个同伴认出这个地方是库伯河，再往前走一点路就是费城，我们一走出小河就看见了那座城市，到那儿时大概是周日早晨八九点钟，在马克街码头上岸。</p>
<p>我特别详细描述旅途发生的细微末节，并且对初次进入的那座城市也将详细记叙，那样便于诸位读者对我希望渺茫的开始与此后在那儿的作为有个比较。</p>
<p>那时我穿的是一身工作服，我最好的衣服是通过海运寄达。一路风尘，我已是蓬头垢面；口袋里塞满衬衣、袜子，人地生疏，不晓得该去何处落脚。虽然我路上奔走、划船，已经疲惫不堪，需要休息，再加上腹中饥馁，真是苦不堪言；但是我全部现金加起来也就是一元荷兰币和大约价值一先令的铜币。我将铜币作为船费给了船家，起初船家觉着我划船出了力，不肯收船费；但是我坚持让他收下；有时一个囊中羞涩的人反倒比他阔绰时出手大方，我想或许是怕人家小觑、轻看之故。</p>
<p>然后我在大街上边走边看，走到集市附近遇上一个手拿面包的男孩。我一路上用面包充饥，因此就问他在哪儿买到面包，我顺着他指的方向直奔第二大街上的面包店，打算要一些我们波士顿常卖的那种饼干；但费城似乎买不到。于是我要求买三便士一个的面包，店主说没有这种面包。我不再想一一询问价格，就给店主三便士，让他随便给我点面包就行。于是他给了我三个巨大的松脆面包卷。我吃惊三便士竟能买到这么大的面包，口袋装不下，我只好拿着一个，腋窝下夹一个，边走边吃另一个。</p>
<p>就这样我从马克街一直走到第四大街，经过里德先生，我未来岳父家门口，当时我未来的妻子就站在门口看着我，觉着我样子极其笨拙可笑，当时我那形象的确如此。接着，我吃着面包卷从栗子街又拐入胡桃街，逛了一圈，发现自己又站在了马克街码头，我上了附近一艘船，到船上找口水喝，一个面包卷就把肚子填满了，我将另两个面包卷一股脑送给了与我们同船而来的一位女人和她的孩子，他们正在等船继续远行。</p>
<p>填饱了肚子，于是我又走上大街，那时街上许多衣着整洁的人都朝着一个方向走。我跟随着他们，由此被带入市场附近的贵格会大教堂。我坐在他们中间，四处打量一番，没听见有人说什么，前夜劳倦纷纷袭来，头发昏，很快就睡着了，我这一觉就睡到教会结束，直到有个十分和蔼的人将我唤醒。这是我到费城第一次睡觉的地方。</p>
<p>我又朝着江边走去，一路上打量人们的面容。我遇到一个年轻的贵格派信徒，他的脸给我一种好感，于是我上前与他搭讪，请求他指点我外地人在哪找到住宿的地方。我们当时就在“三个水手旅店”的牌匾附近。“这儿，”他说，“就是招待外地人的地方，但是名声不好；如果你愿跟我走，我会给你看间更好的。”他把我带到坐落于水街的“曲营旅店”。我在那儿吃了顿晚饭；吃饭时店主圆滑地打探我的来路，我年轻的外貌和褴褛的衣衫似乎让他们把我联想成了一个逃亡者。饭后我又想瞌睡，店主把我带到一张床前，我未及脱衣就一头扎下去，一觉睡到晚上六点；被叫醒吃了晚饭，又早早上床，美美地睡到第二天清晨。</p>

<p>GOLDSMITH AND ADDISON</p>
<p>格尔斯密斯与艾迪生</p>
<p>William Makepeace Thackeray, 1811-1863, was born in Calcutta, and is
one of the most popular of English novelists, essayists, and humorists.
While a boy, he removed from India to England, where he was educated at
the Charterhouse in London, and at Cambridge. When twenty-one years of
age, he came into possession of about 20,000 pounds. He rapidly
dissipated his fortune, however, and was compelled to work for his
living, first turning his attention to law and then to art, but finally
choosing literature as his profession. He was for many years
correspondent, under assumed names, at the “London Times,” “The New
Monthly Magazine,” “Punch,” and “Fraser’s Magazine.” His first novel
under his own name, “Vanity Fair,” appeared in monthly numbers during
1846-8, and is generally considered his finest production: although
“Pendennis,” “Henry Esmond,” and “The Newcomes” are also much admired.
His lectures on “English Humorists of the Eighteenth Century,” from
which the following selections are taken, were delivered in England
first in 1851, and afterwards in America, which he visited in 1852 and
again in 1855-6. During the latter visit, he first delivered his course
of lectures on “The Four Georges,” which were later repeated in England.
At the close of 1859, Thackeray became editor of the “Cornhill
Magazine,” and made it one of the most successful serials ever
published.</p>
<p>Thackeray has been charged with cynicism in his writings, but he was
noted for his happy temper and genial disposition towards all who came
in contact with him.</p>
<p>I．GOLDSMITH</p>
<p>To be the most beloved of English writers, what a title that is for a
man! A wild youth, wayward, but full of tenderness and affection, quits
the country village where his boyhood has been passed in happy musing,
in idle shelter, in fond longing to see the great world out of doors,
and achieve name and fortune—and after years of dire struggle, and
neglect, and poverty, his heart turning back as fondly to his native
place as it had longed eagerly for change when sheltered there, he
writes a book and a poem, full of the recollections and feelings of
home; he paints the friends and scenes of his youth, and peoples Auburn
and Wakefield with the remembrances of Lissoy.</p>
<p>Wander he must, but he carries away a home relic with him, and dies
with it on his breast. His nature is truant; in repose it longs for
change: as on the journey it looks back for friends and quiet. He passes
to-day in building an air castle for tomorrow, or in writing yesterday’s
elegy; and he would flyaway this hour, but that a cage, necessity, keeps
him. What is the charm of his verse, of his style, and humor? His sweet
regrets, his delicate compassion, his soft smile, his tremulous
sympathy, the weakness which he owns?</p>
<p>Your love for him is half pity. You come hot and tired from the day’s
battle, and this sweet minstrel sings to you. Who could harm the kind
vagrant harper? Whom did he ever hurt? He carries no weapon, save the
harp on which he plays to you, and with which he delights great and
humble, young and old, the captains in the tents, or the soldiers round
the fire, or the women and children in the villages, at whose porches he
stops and sings his simple songs of love and beauty. With that sweet
story of “The Vicar of Wakefield” he has found entry into every castle
and every hamlet in Europe. Not one of us, however busy or hard, but
once or twice in our lives has passed an evening with him, and undergone
the charm of his delightful music.</p>
<p>II．ADDISON</p>
<p>We love him for his vanities as much as his virtues. What is
ridiculous is delightful in him; we are so fond of him because we laugh
at him so. And out of that laughter, and out of that sweet weakness, and
out of those harmless eccentricities and follies, and out of that
touched brain, and out of that honest manhood and simplicity—we get a
result of happiness, goodness, tenderness, pity, piety; such as doctors
and divines but seldom have the fortune to inspire. And why not? Is the
glory of Heaven to be sung only by gentlemen in black coats?</p>
<p>When this man looks from the world, whose weaknesses he describes so
benevolently, up to the Heaven which shines over us all, I can hardly
fancy a human face lighted up with a more serene rapture; a human
intellect thrilling with a purer love and adoration than Joseph
Addison’s. Listen to him: from your childhood you have known the verses;
but who can hear their sacred music without love and awe?</p>
<p>“Soon as the evening shades prevail,</p>
<p>The moon takes up the wondrous tale,</p>
<p>And nightly to the listening earth</p>
<p>Repeats the story of her birth;</p>
<p>And all the stars that round her burn,</p>
<p>And all the planets in their turn,</p>
<p>Confirm the tidings as they roll,</p>
<p>And spread the truth from pole to pole.</p>
<p>“What though, in solemn silence, all</p>
<p>Move round this dark terrestrial ball;</p>
<p>What though no real voice nor sound</p>
<p>Among their radiant orbs be found;</p>
<p>In reason’s ear they all rejoice,</p>
<p>And utter forth a glorious voice,</p>
<p>Forever singing, as they shine,</p>
<p>The Hand that made us is divine.”</p>
<p>It seems to me those verses shine like the stars. They shine out of a
great, deep calm. When he turns to Heaven, a Sabbath comes over that
man’s mind; and his face lights up from it with a glory of thanks and
prayers. His sense of religion stirs through his whole being. In the
fields, in the town; looking at the birds in the trees; at the children
in the streets; in the morning or in the moonlight; over his books in
his own room; in a happy party at a country merrymaking or a town
assembly, good will and peace to God’s creatures, and love and awe of
Him who made them, fill his pure heart and shine from his kind face. If
Swift’s life was the most wretched, I think Addison’s was one of the
most enviable. A life prosperous and beautiful—a calm death—an immense
fame and affection afterwards for his happy and spotless name.</p>

<p>1．格尔斯密斯</p>
<p>“英格兰最受人喜爱的作家”，这个称呼对一个人而言是多么了不起啊！他年少时狂放而任性不羁，但内心满怀着柔情与慈爱，离开了乡村——他曾在这儿快乐地沉思，无忧无虑地玩耍，度过了他的童年；强烈渴望着看看外面的精彩世界，取得功名、获得财富。可是艰苦奋斗了几年之后，他仍然寂寂无名，一贫如洗，于是他的心温柔地怀念起了故土，切切憧憬着家乡的变化，满怀对家的思念之情，他写了一本书和一首诗；他用文字描绘出他的朋友和青年时代的美好场景，以及身系他对家乡利索怀念之情的人物——奥本和维克菲尔德。</p>
<p>他注定要去流浪，但是随身带走了家乡的纪念物，去世时那个纪念物还在他怀里揣着。他本是懒散的性情，安静时渴望改变：旅途中静静想念朋友，他走过今天就为明天搭建一座空中楼阁，或是为昨日写下挽歌；这时间他要逃离家乡，但家乡如一个不可逃脱的笼子，包围着他的心灵。他的诗篇、风格和幽默的魅力何在？是他甜美的遗憾、微妙的恻悯、温柔的笑容、丰富的同情和个性的瑕疵吗？</p>
<p>你对他的喜爱一半出于怜惜。日子如战争，过得紧张疲惫，你兴冲冲来，这甜美的吟游诗歌正好舒缓心情。谁会伤害弹竖琴的流浪者呢？他又曾伤害过何人呢？他手无寸铁，只有那把为你们弹拨弦乐的竖琴，他用竖琴给尊卑贵贱、青年和老者、营房里的军官、围着篝火的士兵、乡村里的农妇以及孩童都带去了欢乐。他站在谁家门口，谁就能一享他那颂扬爱与美的纯朴歌谣。他唱着《维克菲尔德牧师》的甜美故事走遍欧洲的城郭与村庄。而我们这些人，不管多辛苦，总会忙里偷闲和他共度一两个夜晚，领略他那甜美音乐的魅力。</p>
<p>2．艾迪生</p>
<p>我们爱他的美德，同样也爱他的浮华。他的荒唐正是他可爱之处；我们如此喜爱他，因为我们可以毫无顾忌地拿他的荒唐事取笑逗乐。我们变得快乐而善良、柔情而慈悲，虔诚而孝敬——这样的改变是医生和牧师都极少能幸运激发的，而这一切皆源于他的笑容，源于他性格里那可爱的缺点，源于他那些对人无害的怪癖和愚蠢的举动，源于他那易感动的神经，源于他那诚实的男子气概与天真。有何不可呢？难道天堂的荣誉只有穿黑大衣的绅士可以唱颂吗？</p>
<p>这个男人俯瞰着尘世——他用如此仁慈的笔调描绘这世间的丑恶，他的光华飞升入天堂，照耀着我们，我无法想象，这样一张愈加平静的狂喜而神采焕发的脸庞，还有谁能与之媲美；我无法想象，一个因更加纯洁的爱和崇拜而激动的颤抖的智者，舍约瑟夫·艾迪生还能有谁。请听他说的：从孩提时代，你就熟稔诗章；但是没有爱与敬畏之心，谁能听到文字里圣乐的流淌？</p>
<p>不久，随着暮色的浓重，</p>
<p>月儿捧起奇妙的故事，</p>
<p>每夜向聆听的地球；</p>
<p>讲述她诞生的传奇；</p>
<p>众星捧月，</p>
<p>行星自传，</p>
<p>锁定涨落的潮汐，</p>
<p>把真理传播世界各地。</p>
<p>“尽管，一切天体都庄严肃穆，</p>
<p>围绕黑暗的地球运动；</p>
<p>尽管，光芒四射的天体之间</p>
<p>万籁俱寂，不闻语声；</p>
<p>但是他们皆因理性之耳快乐，</p>
<p>并说出一句精妙的话语，</p>
<p>永远歌唱，如同他们永远发光，</p>
<p>造物主的手万能神圣。”</p>
<p>对我而言，那些诗文似乎如夜空里群星璀璨。光芒发自伟大深沉的平静。他抬头望向天空，心中想起了安息日，那感恩而虔诚的祈祷，使他的面容神采奕奕。他的宗教情怀在他整个身心激荡。田野，城市，上帝无处不在；看枝头飞鸟也让他产生别样情愫；上帝在街巷玩耍的孩子身旁护佑；上帝在清晨、月光下漫步，在他房间的书本之上停驻；即使在乡村狂欢晚会或是城镇的集市上，他都感受到上帝赐予众生的善意与祥和；对造物主的热爱和敬畏，充满他纯洁的心灵，让他的脸光彩照人。如果说斯威夫特的生活悲惨到极点，那么艾迪生的人生则完美得令人羡嫉。他的一生富足美好——他的死亡平静而安宁——他那幸福快乐、完美无瑕的名字传诸后世，誉满天下，赢得世人的喜爱。</p>

<p>CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON</p>
<p>华盛顿之品格</p>
<p>Jared Sparks, 1789-1866, was born at Willington, Connecticut, and
graduated at Harvard in 1815. He was tutor in the University for two
years, and in 1819 was ordained pastor of the Unitarian Church in
Baltimore. In 1823 he returned to Boston, purchased the “North American
Review,” and was its sole editor for seven years. From 1839 to 1849 he
was Professor in Harvard, and for the next three years was President of
the University. Mr. Sparks has written extensively on American history
and biography, including the lives of Washington and Franklin. He
collected the materials for his biographies with great care, and wrought
them up with much skill.</p>
<p>The person of Washington was commanding, graceful, and fitly
proportioned; his stature six feet, his chest broad and full, his limbs
long and somewhat slender, but well-shaped and muscular. His features
were regular and symmetrical, his eyes of a light blue color, and his
whole countenance, in its quiet state, was grave, placid, and benignant.
When alone, or not engaged in conversation, he appeared sedate and
thoughtful; but when his attention was excited, his eye kindled quickly,
and his face beamed with animation and intelligence.</p>
<p>He was not fluent in speech, but what he said was apposite, and
listened to with the more interest as being known to come from the
heart. He seldom attempted sallies of wit or humor, but no man received
more pleasure from an exhibition of them by others; and, although
contented in seclusion, he sought his chief happiness in society, and
participated with delight in all its rational and innocent amusements.
Without austerity on the one hand, or an appearance of condescending
familiarity on the other, he was affable, courteous, and cheerful; but
it has often been remarked that there was a dignity in his person and
manner not easy to be defined, which impressed everyone that saw him for
the first time with an instinctive deference and awe. This may have
arisen, in part, from a conviction of his superiority, as well as from
the effect produced by his external form and deportment.</p>
<p>The character of his mind was unfolded in the public and private acts
of his life; and the proofs of his greatness are seen almost as much in
the one as the other. The same qualities which raised him to the
ascendency he possessed over the will of a nation, as the commander of
armies and chief magistrate, caused him to be loved and respected as an
individual. Wisdom, judgment, prudence, and firmness were his
predominant traits. No man ever saw more clearly the relative importance
of things and actions, or divested himself more entirely of the bias of
personal interest, partiality, and prejudice, in discriminating between
the true and the false, the right and the wrong, in all questions and
subjects that were presented to him. He deliberated slowly, but decided
surely; and when his decision was once formed he seldom reversed it, and
never relaxed from the execution of a measure till it was completed.
Courage, physical and moral, was a part of his nature; and, whether in
battle, or in the midst of popular excitement, he was fearless of
danger, and regardless of consequences to himself.</p>
<p>His ambition was of that noble kind which aims to excel in whatever
it undertakes, and to acquire a power over the hearts of men by
promoting their happiness and winning their affections. Sensitive to the
approbation of others, and solicitous to deserve it, he made no
concessions to gain their applause, either by flattering their vanity or
yielding to their caprices. Cautious without timidity, bold without
rashness, cool in counsel, deliberate but firm in action, clear in
foresight, patient under reverses, steady, persevering, and
self-possessed, he met and conquered every obstacle that obstructed his
path to honor, renown and success. More confident in the uprightness of
his intention than in his resources, he sought knowledge and advice from
other men. He chose his counselors with unerring sagacity; and his quick
perception of the soundness of an opinion, and of the strong points in
an argument, enabled him to draw to his aid the best fruits of their
talents, and the light of their collected wisdom.</p>
<p>His moral qualities were in perfect harmony with those of his
intellect. Duty was the ruling principle of his conduct; and the rare
endowments of his understanding were not more constantly tasked to
devise the best methods of effecting an object, than they were to guard
the sanctity of conscience. No instance can be adduced in which he was
actuated by a sinister motive or endeavored to attain an end by unworthy
means. Truth, integrity, and justice were deeply rooted in his mind; and
nothing could rouse his indignation so soon, or so utterly destroy his
confidence, as the discovery of the want of these virtues in anyone whom
he had trusted. Weaknesses, follies, indiscretions be could forgive; but
subterfuge and dishonesty he never forgot, rarely pardoned.</p>
<p>He was candid and sincere, true to his friends, and faithful to all;
neither practicing dissimulation, descending to artifice, nor holding
out expectations which he did not intend should be realized. His
passions were strong, and sometimes they broke out with vehemence: but
he had the power of checking them in an instant. Perhaps self-control
was the most remarkable trait of his character. It was, in part, the
effect of discipline; yet he seems by nature to have possessed this
power in a degree which has been denied to other men.</p>
<p>A Christian in faith and practice, he was habitually devout. His
reverence for religion is seen in his example, his public
communications, and his private writings. He uniformly ascribed his
successes to the beneficent agency of the Supreme Being. Charitable and
humane, he was liberal to the poor, and kind to those in distress. As a
husband, son, and brother, he was tender and affectionate. Without
vanity, ostentation, or pride, he never spoke of himself or his actions
unless required by circumstances which concerned the public
interests.</p>
<p>As he was free from envy, so he had the good fortune to escape the
envy of others by standing on an elevation which none could hope to
attain. If he had one passion more strong than another it was love of
his country. The purity and ardor of his patriotism were commensurate
with the greatness of its object. Love of country in him was invested
with the sacred obligation of a duty; and from the faithful discharge of
this duty he never swerved for a moment, either in thought or deed,
through the whole period of his eventful career.</p>
<p>Such are some of the traits in the character of Washington, which
have acquired for him the love and veneration of mankind. If they are
not marked with the brilliancy, extravagance, and eccentricity, which,
in other men, have excited the astonishment of the world, so neither are
they tarnished by the follies, nor disgraced by the crimes of those men.
It is the happy combination of rare talents and qualities, the
harmonious union of the intellectual and moral powers, rather than the
dazzling splendor of any one trait, which constitute the grandeur of his
character. If the title of great man ought to be reserved for him who
can not be charged with an indiscretion or a vice; who spent his life in
establishing the independence, the glory, and durable prosperity of his
country; who succeeded in all that he undertook; and whose successes
were never won at the expense of honor, justice, integrity, or by the
sacrifice of a single principle,—this title will not be denied to
Washington.</p>
<p>How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!</p>
<p>While the mere victors may appall or stun</p>
<p>The servile and the vain, such names will be</p>
<p>A watchword till the future shall be free.</p>
<p>(Byron )</p>

<p>华盛顿生得威风凛凛，姿态优雅，身材匀称；他身高六英尺，胸膛宽阔厚实，四肢修长，但体型漂亮肌肉健美。他的五官端正，眼泛宝石蓝光芒，安静时，面容肃穆沉着，和蔼亲切。独处之时或社交之暇，他是一副稳重而若有所思的样子；然而一旦他的注意力被调动起来，他的双眸立即放亮，脸上焕发出生气和智慧之光。</p>
<p>他不善言辞，但言辞得当，因为他的话出自肺腑，人人喜欢听。他很少故意表现聪慧和幽默，但是人们听着他的言辞，却更觉欢欣；虽然对隐居的生活感到满足，但他的幸福主要源自于社会，源自于与人们分享各种符合情理而天真未泯的娱乐。他既不是一个严厉之人，也从来不摆出一副屈尊俯就的架势，他友善可亲、彬彬有礼、通达开朗；但给人们留下深刻印象的是他相貌举止中透出的一种难以形容的高贵，这种气质使初次与其相识的人本能地感到一种尊重与敬畏。之所以有这种感觉，部分原因可能是人们折服于他的卓越不凡，也可能是他的外在形象和举止产生的影响。</p>
<p>他的思想品格在公开活动和私人生活中可见一斑；他的伟大人格则在方方面面都得到印证。正是这种品质，蕴蓄了他赢得一个国家民心的能力，虽然他身为军队指挥官总司令和最高行政官，但人民只把他看作一个纯粹的人来热爱敬重。睿智、远见卓识、坚定不移是他性格的主要特征。对于事务与行动之间的利害关系，没有人会比他们看得更清楚，他从不带个人成见，完全摒弃了私心偏爱，对摆在他面前的各种问题和话题，辨别真伪，区分是非。大事当前，他虽然再三权衡，但是决定果断；决议一旦形成，就很难更改，必然贯彻实施，执行到底。而他人格的另一部分魅力则表现在有胆有谋、身体力行、品性端正；无论是硝烟弥漫的战场，还是在欢呼雷动的人群之中，他总是无视任何危险，将个人安危置之度外。</p>
<p>他的雄心抱负是宏伟的，是为了无愧于使命赋予他的责任，他通过提高人们的幸福赢得民众的爱戴，获得征服人心的力量。对于人们的赞许，他十分敏感，并且渴望配得上这种荣誉，但他并不会为了得到欢呼喝彩而迎合人们的虚荣，或对他们的反复无常让步。他谨慎但不怯懦，大胆但不轻率，他冷静听取建议，反复思虑但行事果断；他远见卓识，直面挫败；他沉着冷静，百折不挠，他克服了荣耀与功名之途上的重重障碍。他更相信自己行事目标的正直，而不去依赖才智，总是从别人身上汲取学养与建议。他慧眼卓识地挑选顾问，还能敏锐地觉察某个观点的合理之处，找到争论中让人无可辩驳的理由，这使他能汲取人才身上的精华，点燃了群集的智慧之光。</p>
<p>他的道德品质，与他的才智完美融合。责任是他的最高行为原则；他那天赋的理解力，除了时时用来筹划达到某个目标的捷径之外，还要守卫道德之神圣。观其一生所作所为，你找不出动机阴险或是为达目标不择手段的例子。诚实、正直和正义在他思想的沃土根深蒂固；没有任何事情能像发现信任之人反而缺少这些美德那样，能把他激得如此勃然大怒，这样彻底地摧垮他的信心。如果说弱点、愚蠢、轻率还情有可原，那么诡计多端之人他绝难轻饶，也罕有得到他的宽恕者。</p>
<p>他对待朋友率直而真挚，对所有人诚实守信，他既不善虚以委蛇，戴着面具做人，也不会坚持不切实际的期望。他热情洋溢，有时激情突然爆发；但是他能瞬间自控。这种自控能力或许是他性格中最显著的特点。其中部分是得益于后天磨炼；然而某种程度上，他似乎天生就具备了别人难以达到的能力。</p>
<p>他是耶稣的忠实信徒，习惯性将信仰践行于实际。他对宗教之敬畏在他处理事务、与公众交流以及他的私人著作里随处可见。而自己的成功，一概归功于上帝的这位代理人给他的恩赐。他是慷慨仁慈之人，对穷人乐善好施，对身处困厄的人施以援手。他是忠贞的丈夫，孝顺的儿子，堪为表率的兄长。他不事虚荣、不卖弄、不自骄，除非个人活动与公众的利益息息相关，否则他绝不会提及自己。</p>
<p>因无利己之念，也就无嫉妒之心，他站在常人无法匹及的高度，所以摆脱了他人的嫉妒。如果说他的热情比任何人都强烈，那就是对国家的爱。他的爱国之心纯粹灼热，国之幅员有多辽阔，他的爱就有多深远。他的爱使他对国家负有一种神圣的责任；他忠于责任，一刻不曾背离职守，这种责任感存在于思想上，存在于行动中，贯穿了他的整个国务生涯。</p>
<p>上述是华盛顿的一些人格特征，这些品质为他赢得了世人的爱戴与崇敬。他身上的这种人格魅力如此光辉夺目、卓越不群，让举世震惊；既不会被他者的邪恶玷污，也不会因他们的罪恶蒙羞。这不是他伟大性格的某个特征在独放光彩，而是罕见之才能与品质的相辅相成，是智慧与道德的和谐统一。如果伟人的称号，是以言行的谨慎、品行的完美为评判尺度，以他为国家的独立、荣誉、持久的繁荣奋斗终生为准绳，以他成功完成了他所担负的各项使命，以他丝毫无损荣誉正义与诚实，从不以牺牲一个原则而取得辉煌成功为标准，那么，伟人之称号，华盛顿当之无愧。</p>
<p>那耳畔的回声如此美妙！</p>
<p>纯粹的征服者，使媚骨之人胆寒</p>
<p>贪慕虚荣者惊倒，这些伟名直到</p>
<p>未来自由世界，都将是吹响的号角。</p>

<p>EULOGY ON WASHINGTON</p>
<p>华盛顿颂</p>
<p>General Henry Lee, 1756-1818, a member of the celebrated Lee family
of Virginia, was born in Westmoreland County in that state, and died on
Cumberland Island, Georgia. He graduated at Princeton in his eighteenth
year. In 1777 he marched with a regiment of cavalry to join the patriot
army, and served with fidelity and success till the close of the war. He
was noted for his bravery, skill, and celerity, and received the
nickname of “Light-horse Harry.” He was a great favorite with both
General Greene and General Washington. In 1786 Virginia appointed him
one of her delegates to Congress; he also took an active part in favor
of the adoption of the constitution in the Virginia Convention of 1788.
On the breaking out of the “Whisky Rebellion” in Pennsylvania, in 1794,
the President sent General Lee with an army to suppress the disturbance.
The insurgents submitted without resistance. In 1799 he was again a
member of Congress; and, on the death of Washington, that body appointed
him to pronounce a eulogy upon the life and character of the great and
good man. The following extract contains the closing part of the
oration.</p>
<p>Who is there that has forgotten the vales of Brandywine, the fields
of Germantown, or the plains of Monmouth? Everywhere present, wants of
every kind obstructing, numerous and valiant armies encountering,
himself a host, he assuaged our sufferings, limited our privations, and
upheld our tottering Republic. Shall I display to you the spread of the
fire of his soul by rehearsing the praises of the hero of Saratoga, and
his much-loved compeer of the Carolinas? No; our Washington wears not
borrowed glory. To Gates—to Greene, he gave without reserve the applause
due to their eminent merit; and long may the chiefs of Saratoga and of
Eutaw receive the grateful respect of a grateful people.</p>
<p>Moving in his own orbit, he imparted heat and light to his most
distant satellites; and, combining the physical and moral force of all
within his sphere, with irresistible weight he took his course,
commiserating folly, disdaining vice, dismaying treason, and
invigorating despondency; until the auspicious hour arrived, when,
united with the intrepid forces of a potent and magnanimous ally, he
brought to submission Cornwallis, since the conqueror of India; thus
finishing his long career of military glory with a luster corresponding
to his great name, and in this his last act of war, affixing the seal of
fate to our nation’s birth.</p>
<p>First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen, he was second to none in humble and endearing scenes of
private life. Pious, just, humane, temperate, sincere, uniform,
dignified, and commanding, his example was edifying to all around him,
as were the effects of that example lasting.</p>
<p>To his equals, he was condescending; to his inferiors, kind; and to
the dear object of his affections, exemplarily tender. Correct
throughout, vice shuddered in his presence, and virtue always felt his
fostering hand; the purity of his private character gave effulgence to
his public virtues.</p>
<p>His last scene comported with the whole tenor of his life. Although
in extreme pain, not a sigh, not a groan, escaped him; and with
undisturbed serenity he closed his well-spent life. Such was the man
America has lost! Such was the man for whom our nation mourns!</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-578">中文阅读</h4>
<p>有谁忘记了布兰迪万河谷、杰曼敦的田野与蒙默思郡的平原？眼下，每个地方都能畅通无阻，无数英勇之军胜利会师，作为主持这一历史进程的人，他想方设法减轻我们遭受的折磨与痛苦，尽量把我们的贫困降到最低限度，支撑着我们风雨飘摇的共和国。难道我必须给你们演示他如何赞美萨拉托加的英雄，给你们展示他灵魂的热情之火，看那火焰如何感染卡莱罗那战役中那些挚爱的战友？不；我们的华盛顿不佩戴借来的荣誉勋章。对盖茨将军——格林将军，对他们的丰功伟绩，他不遗余力地给予掌声；也始终祝愿萨拉托加战役和尤托斯普林斯战役的指挥官们，能收到人们回馈给他们的由衷敬意。</p>
<p>我们还是走进他的内心世界，看看他的心灵轨迹，他将自己的光和热传递给距他遥远之极的追随者；而且把我们所有的物质与精神力量组合到他的范围内，自然而然地汇聚了势不可当的力量，他怜悯愚蠢的行为，鄙视恶劣行径，震慑叛逆的勾当，使令人灰心的局势焕发希望；直到那个吉祥的时刻来临。当时，他联合宽宏大量的同盟国的强大武装部队，迫使那个因征服了印度而不可一世的康沃利斯缴械投降；从此给漫长而光荣的军事生涯划上了句号，成就了他名副其实的伟名，而他在最后一场战争的所作所为，确保了美利坚合众国的诞生。</p>
<p>他在战争中一马当先，他为和平不遗余力，他在国民心中享有最高声望，在私人生活中，他的谦逊与受欢迎的程度更是无人堪比。虔诚、公正、仁慈、克己、真诚、始终如一、高贵、威严，他让周围所有的人得到启发，人人以他为榜样，正如他的表率效应持久不衰。</p>
<p>与他同尊的人，他谦逊俯就；对下属，他和蔼可亲；而对他的爱人，他温柔呵护；他始终坚持正确的原则，道德低下的人在他面前瑟瑟发抖，而他的手总是在培植美德之花；他那纯洁无瑕的个人品质使他的公众美德光彩夺目。</p>
<p>而在他人生谢幕的最后时刻，亦体现了他一生身体力行的人生宗旨。尽管他忍受着巨大的病痛，但是他却以坚韧的意志克制，没有发出一声呻吟叹息；就这样从容安静地闭上了眼睛，结束了分秒未曾虚度的一生。美国痛失伟人！举国沉痛哀悼！</p>

<p>THE SOLITARY REAPER</p>
<p>孤独的割麦女</p>
<p>William Wordsworth, 1770-1850, the founder of the “Lake School” of
poets, was born at Cockermouth, Cumberland, England. From his boyhood he
was a great lover and student of nature, and it is to his beautiful
descriptions of landscape, largely, that he owes his fame. He was a
graduate of Cambridge University, and while there commenced the study of
Chaucer, Spenser, Milton, and Shakespeare, as models for his own
writings. Two legacies having been bequeathed him, Wordsworth determined
to make poetry the aim of his life, and in 1795 located at Racedown with
his sister Dorothy, where he commenced the tragedy of “The Borderers.” A
visit from Coleridge at this period made the two poets friends for life.
In 1802 Wordsworth married Miss Mary Hutchinson, and in 1813 he settled
at Rydal Mount, on Lake Windermere, where he passed the remainder of his
life.</p>
<p>Wordsworth’s poetry is remarkable for its extreme simplicity of
language. At first his efforts were almost universally ridiculed, and in
1819 his entire income from literary work had not amounted to 140
Pounds. In 1830 his merit began to be recognized; in 1839 Oxford
University conferred upon him the degree of D. C. L.; and in 1843 he was
made poet laureate.</p>
<p>“The Excursion” is by far the most beautiful and the most important
of Wordsworth’s productions. “Salisbury Plain,” “The White Doe of
Rylstone,” “Yarrow Revisited,” and many of his sonnets and minor poems
are also much admired.</p>
<p>Behold her, single in the field,</p>
<p>Yon solitary Highland lass!</p>
<p>Reaping and singing by herself;</p>
<p>Stop here, or gently pass!</p>
<p>Alone she cuts and binds the grain,</p>
<p>And sings a melancholy strain;</p>
<p>Oh listen! for the vale profound</p>
<p>Is overflowing with the sound.</p>
<p>No nightingale did ever chant</p>
<p>More welcome notes to weary bands</p>
<p>Of travelers in some shady haunt,</p>
<p>Among Arabian sands:</p>
<p>A voice so thrilling ne’er was heard</p>
<p>In springtime from the cuckoo bird,</p>
<p>Breaking the silence of the seas</p>
<p>Among the farthest Hebrides.</p>
<p>Will no one tell me what she sings?</p>
<p>Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow</p>
<p>For old, unhappy, far-off things,</p>
<p>And battles long ago:</p>
<p>Or is it some more humble lay,</p>
<p>Familiar matter of to-day?</p>
<p>Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,</p>
<p>That has been, and may be again?</p>
<p>Whate’er the theme, the maiden sang</p>
<p>As if her song could have no ending;</p>
<p>I saw her singing at her work,</p>
<p>And o’er the sickle bending;—</p>
<p>I listened motionless and still;</p>
<p>And, as I mounted up the hill,</p>
<p>The music in my heart I bore,</p>
<p>Long after it was heard no more.</p>

<p>看她，那独处高原的姑娘，</p>

<p>VALUE OF THE PRESENT</p>
<p>现在的价值</p>
<p>Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1803-1882, the celebrated essayist and
philosopher, was born in Boston. His father was a Unitarian minister,
and the son, after graduating at Harvard University, entered the
ministry also, and took charge of a Unitarian congregation in Boston.
His peculiar ideas on religious topics soon caused him to retire from
the ministry, and he then devoted himself to literature. As a lecturer,
Emerson attained a wide reputation, both in this country and in England,
and he is considered as one of the most independent and original
thinkers of the age. His style is brief and pithy, dazzling by its wit,
but sometimes paradoxical. He wrote a few poems, but they are not
generally admired, being didactic in style, bare, and obscure. Among his
best known publications are his volume “Nature,” and his lectures, “The
Mind and Manners of the Nineteenth Century,” “The Superlative in Manners
and Literature,” “English Character and Manners,” and “The Conduct of
Life.” In 1850 appeared “Representative Men,” embracing sketches of
Plato, Swedenborg, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Napoleon, and Goethe.</p>
<p>Such are the days,—the earth is the cup, the sky is the cover, of the
immense bounty of nature which is offered us for our daily aliment; but
what a force of illusion begins life with us, and attends us to the end!
We are coaxed, flattered, and duped, from morn to eve, from birth to
death; and where is the old eye that ever saw through the deception? The
Hindoos represent Maia, the illusory energy of Vishnu, as one of his
principal attributes. As if, in this gale of warring elements, which
life is, it was necessary to bind souls to human life as mariners in a
tempest lash themselves to the mast and bulwarks of a ship, and Nature
employed certain illusions as her ties and straps,—a rattle, a doll, an
apple, for a child; skates, a river, a boat, a horse, a gun, for the
growing boy;—and I will not begin to name those of the youth and adult,
for they are numberless. Seldom and slowly the mask falls, and the pupil
is permitted to see that all is one stuff, cooked and painted under many
counterfeit appearances. Hume’s doctrine was that the circumstances
vary, the amount of happiness does not; that the beggar cracking fleas
in the sunshine under a hedge, and the duke rolling by in his chariot,
the girl equipped for her first ball, and the orator returning
triumphant from the debate, had different means, but the same quantity
of pleasant excitement.</p>
<p>This element of illusion lends all its force to hide the values of
present time. Who is he that does not always find himself doing
something less than his best task? “What are you doing?” “Oh, nothing; I
have been doing thus, or I shall do so or so, but now I am only—” Ah!
poor dupe, will you never slip out of the web of the master
juggler?—never learn that, as soon as the irrecoverable years have woven
their blue glory between to-day and us, these passing hours shall
glitter and draw us, as the wildest romance and the homes of beauty and
poetry? How difficult to deal erect with them! The events they bring,
their trade, entertainments, and gossip, their urgent work, all throw
dust in the eyes and distract attention. He is a strong man who can look
them in the eye, see through this juggle, feel their identity, and keep
his own; who can know surely that one will be like another to the end of
the world, nor permit love, or death, or politics, or money, war, or
pleasure, to draw him from his task.</p>
<p>The world is always equal to itself, and every man in moments of
deeper thought is apprised that he is repeating the experiences of the
people in the streets of Thebes or Byzantium. An everlasting Now reigns
in nature, which hangs the same roses on our bushes which charmed the
Roman and the Chaldean in their hanging gardens. “To what end, then,” he
asks, “should I study languages, and traverse countries, to learn so
simple truths?”</p>
<p>History of ancient art, excavated cities, recovery of books and
inscriptions,—yes, the works were beautiful, and the history worth
knowing; and academies convene to settle the claims of the old schools.
What journeys and measurements,—Niebuhr and Muller and Layard,—to
identify the plain of Troy and Nimroud town! And your homage to Dante
costs you so much sailing; and to ascertain the discoverers of America
needs as much voyaging as the discovery cost. Poor child! that flexible
clay of which these old brothers molded their admirable symbols was not
Persian, nor Memphian, nor Teutonic, nor local at all, but was common
lime and silex and water, and sunlight, the heat of the blood, and the
heaving of the lungs; it was that clay which thou heldest but now in thy
foolish hands, and threwest away to go and seek in vain in sepulchers,
mummy pits, and old bookshops of Asia Minor, Egypt, and England. It was
the deep to-day which all men scorn; the rich poverty, which men hate;
the populous, all-loving solitude, which men quit for the tattle of
towns. He lurks, he hides,—he who is success, reality, joy, and power.
One of the illusions is that the present hour is not the critical,
decisive hour. Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in
the year. No man has learned anything rightly, until he knows that every
day is Doomsday. ’T is the old secret of the gods that they come in low
disguises. ’T is the vulgar great who come dizened with gold and jewels.
Real kings hide away their crowns in their wardrobes, and affect a plain
and poor exterior. In the Norse legend of our ancestors, Odin dwells in
a fisher’s hut, and patches a boat. In the Hindoo legends, Hari dwells a
peasant among peasants. In the Greek legend, Apollo lodges with the
shepherds of Admetus; and Jove liked to rusticate among the poor
Ethiopians. So, in our history, Jesus is born in a barn, and his twelve
peers are fishermen. ’T is the very principle of science that Nature
shows herself best in leasts; ’t was the maxim of Aristotle and
Lucretius; and, in modern times, of Swedenborg and of Hahnemann. The
order of changes in the egg determines the age of fossil strata. So it
was the rule of our poets, in the legends of fairy lore, that the
fairies largest in power were the least in size.</p>
<p>In the Christian graces, humility stands highest of all, in the form
of the Madonna; and in life, this is the secret of the wise. We owe to
genius always the same debt, of lifting the curtain from the common, and
showing us that divinities are sitting disguised in the seeming gang of
gypsies and peddlers. In daily life, what distinguishes the master is
the using those materials he has, instead of looking about for what are
more renowned, or what others have used well. “A general,” said
Bonaparte, “always has troops enough, if he only knows how to employ
those he has, and bivouacs with them.” Do not refuse the employment
which the hour brings you, for one more ambitious. The highest heaven of
wisdom is alike near from every point, and thou must find it, if at all,
by methods native to thyself alone.</p>

<p>日子就是这般，大地如杯，天空如盖，里面盛着富足慷慨的大自然，它为众生提供每日的给养；然而这不过是一种如影随形的错觉，从生命伊始直到终结！错觉诱哄了眼睛、阿谀着耳朵，无论晨昏，从生到死，无人不受其愚弄；那洞穿诡诈的慧眼去了哪儿？印度教徒把玛雅、毗湿奴的虚幻能量描述成神的重要属性之一。生命好像就是在思想风暴中绞缠对抗着，灵魂必须与肉体结合起来，正如暴风雨里的水手必须把自己和行船的桅杆与船舷系在一起，而自然之神则利用了一些幻象当作她拴系灵魂与生命的绳子，比如赠送孩子一个拨浪鼓、一个布娃娃、一个苹果；给半大男孩一双冰鞋、一条大江一条小船、一匹马一杆枪；给那些小青年、成年人的需要之物，是数不胜数，我不愿再一一罗列。那一张错觉的面具脱落得极其缓慢，亦难得一见，然而它一旦落下，人们便知道眼前所见种种不过是一种食物，只是经过了篡改和涂染，披上了乔装打扮的外衣。休姆主张幸福总数不会随着环境改变而减少；一围树篱下晒着暖阳捉虱子的乞丐，与从辩论会上凯旋而归的雄辩家生活方式不同，但是那种油然而生的愉悦兴奋是相等的。</p>
<p>这种错觉自有一种力量把现在的价值隐藏。那个总觉着自己所作所为没有发挥到最佳状态的人是谁？“你在干什么？”“啊，没啥：我一直这么干，或者我应该那么那么干，可是现在我只是——”啊！可怜的被愚弄者，难道你从来不会躲开娴熟的骗子设下的陷阱？难道你从来不曾意识，一旦不可挽回的流年已经在今天和我们之间把忧伤的光环编织，这些匆匆逝去的时光将闪闪发亮，就像狂热的罗曼史、美丽的家乡和抒情诗，令人流连忘返、回味无穷？想要正确对待它们多么难呀！它们引起的大事，其中的交易、消遣和流言蜚语，还有它们迫在眉睫的影响，所有这些都迷惑了人们的视听，分散了注意力。但那人是个意志坚强的人，他将一切看在眼里，但他能识破这种把戏，不为所诱；他信心满满，誓要为目标奋斗到底，不允许自己为爱情分心，为政治斗争绞尽脑汁，为了金钱尔虞我诈，为了欢娱消耗时间，影响上天赐予他的伟大使命。</p>
<p>世界总是和它本身保持一致，每个人在沉思时都会恍然大悟，他正在重复底比斯或拜占庭大街上人们的经历。永恒的现在支配自然，而自然将迷住罗马人和迦勒底人、在他们的空中花园里绽放的那些玫瑰花，同样悬挂在我们的灌木花丛。“那么，最终是什么样子，”他问，“我学习各种语言，周游列国，就为了得到如此简单的真理？”</p>
<p>古代艺术史，挖掘出土的城市，修复的书卷和铭文；——是的，这些成果美妙极了，这段历史值得我们去探究；许多院校召开会议，解决各名门学派的立论纷争。为了确认特洛伊平原和宁录城遗址，——尼布尔、穆勒和雷亚德进行了多么奇妙的旅行！对但丁的崇高敬意使你多次渡海到他生活的国度；为了探知美洲，发现者飘洋渡海的花费和发明成本一样多。可怜的孩子！那老哥俩在那块柔韧泥土上刻下的神秘符号，不是波斯语、古孟菲斯语、亦非日耳曼语，也绝非土著语，而是普通的石灰、硅石、水分，阳光、热血和起伏的胸膛；你曾抓起过那块非同寻常的泥块，但是由于你愚蠢的手掂量不出它的价值，就丢掉一边徒然去墓地里搜寻，在木乃伊的胸口上探摸，翻遍小亚细亚、埃及和英格兰书店里的古籍。这就是深刻的今日，所有人都忽视了它；人们憎恨嫌贫爱富之辈；人们弃嘈杂拥挤和蜚短流长的城镇而就清净隐蔽之居。人们错误地以为，现在这一刻并不是有决定意义的时刻。但是我们要牢记，一年的每一日都是最重要的一天。一个人只有真正格物致知，他才能明白每天都是世界末日。这就是诸神乔装入世的古老秘密。而世俗的大人物出行必黄金珠宝缠身。真正君王的王冠藏之衣柜，布衣蔽体，如寻常百姓现身。我们的先祖们有个关于挪威人的传说，奥丁住渔民的小屋，修补破船。印度教传奇中，哈瑞混迹于乡间与农民为伍。希腊神话中，阿波罗和阿德米托斯的牧羊人同居陋室；而朱庇特主神喜欢住在贫穷的埃塞俄比亚人的村落里。所以，我们的历史中，耶稣诞生于马厩，他的十二门徒是渔夫出身。这恰是科学的原理，即自然于极其细微之处展示她的本质；这是亚里士多德和卢克莱修的箴言；近代斯韦登伯格和哈恩曼也极力推崇这个原理。鸡蛋里的转化规则决定了化石岩的年代。因此，这也是我们诗人的创作原理，在所有精灵传奇故事里，能力极大的仙女身材一律微小迷人。</p>
<p>基督教义中，以圣母玛利亚体现的慈悲与谦逊为最；慈悲与谦逊是生活中智慧的奥秘。我们欠缺上述这些，也一直感激天才，是他们撩起俗人眼前的那层神秘帘幕，一一指示给我们看，神就坐在那帮人之间，表面看上去与狡猾的吉普赛人和精明的小商贩们一般无二。日常生活中，辨别大师的方法是看他怎样物尽其用，而不是看他因何声名赫赫或有什么拿手绝活。“一个将军，”拿破仑说，“倘若他深谙人尽其才之道，与战士一起餐风宿露，那么他就始终拥有充足的军事力量，”为了更高远的抱负，别拒绝这一时有助益你能力的工作。智慧天堂的至高点似乎就在每一阶段的不远处，如果你完全靠你独创的方法，就一定会找到它。</p>

<p>HAPPINESS</p>
<p>幸福</p>
<p>Alexander Pope, 1688-1744, was the shining literary light of the
so-called Augustan reign of Queen Anne, the poetry of which was
distinguished by the highest degree of polish and elegance. Pope was the
son of a retired linen draper, who lived in a pleasant country house
near the Windsor Forest. He was so badly deformed that his life was “one
long disease;” he was remarkably precocious, and had a most intelligent
face, with great, flaming, tender eyes. In disposition Pope was the
reverse of admirable. He was extremely sensitive, petulant, and
supercilious; fierce and even coarse in his attacks on opponents;
boastful of his self-acquired wealth and of his intimacy with the
nobility. The great redeeming feature of his character was his tender
devotion to his aged parents.</p>
<p>As a poet, however, Pope challenges the highest admiration. At the
age of sixteen he commenced his “Pastorals,” and when only twenty-one
published his “Essay on Criticism,” pronounced “the finest piece of
argumentative and reasoning poetry in the English language.” His
reputation was now firmly established, and his literary activity ceased
only at his death; although, during the latter portion of his life, he
was so weak physically that he was unable to dress himself or even to
rise from bed without assistance. Pope’s great admiration was Dryden,
whose style he studied and copied. He lacks the latter’s strength, but
in elegance and polish he remains unequaled.</p>
<p>Pope’s most remarkable work is “The Rape of the Lock;” his greatest,
the translation into English verse of Homer’s “Iliad” and “Odyssey.” His
“Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard,” “The Dunciad,” and the “Essay On Man”
are also famous productions. He published an edition of “Shakespeare,”
which was awaited with great curiosity, and received with equal
disappointment. During the three years following its appearance, he
united with Swift and Arbuthnot in writing the “Miscellanies,” an
extensive satire on the abuses of learning and the extravagances of
philosophy. His “Epistles,” addressed to various distinguished men, and
covering a period of four years, were copied after those of Horace; they
were marked by great clearness, neatness of diction, and good sense, and
by Pope’s usual elegance and grace. His “Imitations of Horace” was left
unfinished at his death.</p>
<p>The following selection is an extract from the “Essay on Man;”</p>
<p>Oh, sons of earth! attempt ye still to rise,</p>
<p>By mountains piled on mountains, to the skies?</p>
<p>Heaven still with laughter the vain toil surveys,</p>
<p>And buries madmen in the heaps they raise.</p>
<p>Know all the good that individuals find,</p>
<p>Or God and nature meant to mere mankind.</p>
<p>Reason’s whole pleasure, all the joys of sense,</p>
<p>Lie in three words,—health, peace, and competence.</p>
<p>But health consists with temperance alone;</p>
<p>And peace, O virtue! peace is all thy own.</p>
<p>The good or bad the gifts of fortune gain;</p>
<p>But these less taste them as they worse obtain.</p>
<p>Say, in pursuit of profit or delight,</p>
<p>Who risk the most, that take wrong means or right?</p>
<p>Of vice or virtue, whether blest or curst,</p>
<p>Which meets contempt, or which compassion first?</p>
<p>Count all th’ advantage prosperous vice attains,</p>
<p>’T is but what virtue flies from and disdains:</p>
<p>And grant the bad what happiness they would,</p>
<p>One they must want, which is, to pass for good.</p>
<p>Oh, blind to truth, and God’s whole scheme below,</p>
<p>Who fancy bliss to vice, to virtue woe!</p>
<p>Who sees and follows that great scheme the best,</p>
<p>Best knows the blessing, and will most be blest.</p>
<p>But fools the good alone unhappy call,</p>
<p>For ills or accidents that chance to all.</p>
<p>Think we, like some weak prince, the Eternal Cause,</p>
<p>Prone for his favorites to reverse his laws?</p>
<p>Shall burning AEtna, if a sage requires,</p>
<p>Forget to thunder, and recall her fires?</p>
<p>When the loose mountain trembles from on high,</p>
<p>Shall gravitation cease, if you go by?</p>
<p>“But sometimes virtue starves while vice is fed.”</p>
<p>What, then? Is the reward of virtue bread?</p>
<p>That, vice may merit, ’t is the price of toil;</p>
<p>The knave deserves it when he tills the soil,</p>
<p>The knave deserves it when he tempts the main,</p>
<p>Where folly fights for kings or dives for gain.</p>
<p>Honor and shame from no condition rise;</p>
<p>Act well your part, there all the honor lies.</p>
<p>Worth makes the man, and want of it the fellow;</p>
<p>The rest is all but leather or prunella.</p>
<p>A wit’s a feather, and a chief a rod,</p>
<p>An honest man’s the noblest work of God.</p>
<p>One self-approving hour whole years outweighs</p>
<p>Of stupid starers, and of loud huzzas.</p>
<p>Know then this truth (enough for man to know),</p>
<p>“Virtue alone is happiness below.”</p>
<p>The only point where human bliss stands still,</p>
<p>And tastes the good without the fall to ill;</p>
<p>Where only merit constant pay receives,</p>
<p>Is blest in what it takes and what it gives.</p>

<p>无赖理应得到回报，当他把田地耕种，</p>

<p>荣耀与羞耻毫无先决条件；</p>
<p>你扮演好你的角色，所有犒赏就摆在面前。</p>
<p>价值造就了人，而且需要人们追随；</p>
<p>其余一切无关紧要。</p>
<p>智慧的名声与权力如轻毛，如棍棒，</p>
<p>诚实的人是上帝最杰出的作品。</p>

<p>MARION</p>
<p>马里恩</p>
<p>William Gilmore Simms, 1806-1870, one of the most versatile,
prolific, and popular of American authors, was born at Charleston, South
Carolina. His family was poor, and his means of education were limited,
yet he managed to prepare himself for the bar, to which he was admitted
when twenty-one years of age. The law proving uncongenial, he abandoned
it, and in 1828 became editor of the “Charleston City Gazette.” From
this time till his death his literary activity was unceasing, and his
writings were so numerous that it is possible only to group them under
their various heads. They comprise Biography; History; Historical
Romance, both Foreign and Domestic, the latter being further divided
into Colonial, Revolutionary, and Border Romances; Pure Romance; The
Drama; Poetry; and Criticism; besides miscellaneous books and
pamphlets.</p>
<p>In the midst of this remarkable literary activity, Mr. Simms still
found time to devote to the affairs of state, being for several years a
member of the South Carolina Legislature. He was also a lecturer, and
was connected editorially with several magazines. Most of his time was
spent at his summer house in Charleston, and at his winter residence,
“Woodlands,” on a plantation at Midway, S. C.</p>
<p>The following selection is from “The Life and Times of Francis
Marion.”</p>
<p>Art had done little to increase the comforts or the securities of his
fortress. It was one, complete to his hands, from those of nature—such
an one as must have delighted the generous English outlaw of Sherwood
Forest; insulated by deep ravines and rivers, a dense forest of mighty
trees, and interminable undergrowth. The vine and brier guarded his
passes. The laurel and the shrub, the vine and sweet-scented jessamine
roofed his dwelling, and clambered up between his closed eyelids and the
stars. Obstructions scarcely penetrable by any foe, crowded the pathways
to his tent; and no footstep not practiced in the secret, and to “the
manner born,” might pass unchallenged to his midnight rest. The swamp
was his moat; his bulwarks were the deep ravines, which, watched by
sleepless rifles, were quite as impregnable as the castles on the Rhine.
Here, in the possession of his fortress, the partisan slept secure.</p>
<p>His movements were marked by equal promptitude and wariness. He
suffered no risks from a neglect of proper precaution. His habits of
circumspection and resolve ran together in happy unison. His plans,
carefully considered beforehand, were always timed with the happiest
reference to the condition and feelings of his men. To prepare that
condition, and to train those feelings, were the chief employment of his
repose. He knew his game, and how it should be played, before a step was
taken or a weapon drawn.</p>
<p>When he himself or any of his parties left the island upon an
expedition, they advanced along no beaten paths. They made them as they
went. He had the Indian faculty in perfection, of gathering his course
from the sun, from the stars, from the bark and the tops of trees, and
such other natural guides as the woodman acquires only through long and
watchful experience.</p>
<p>Many of the trails thus opened by him, upon these expeditions, are
now the ordinary avenues of the country. On starting, he almost
invariably struck into the woods, and seeking the heads of the larger
water courses, crossed them at their first and small beginnings. He
destroyed the bridges where he could. He preferred fords. The former not
only facilitated the progress of less fearless enemies, but apprised
them of his own approach. If speed was essential, a more direct but not
less cautious route was pursued.</p>
<p>He intrusted his schemes to nobody, not even his most confidential
officers. He consulted with them respectfully, heard them patiently,
weighed their suggestions, and silently approached his conclusions. They
knew his determinations only from his actions. He left no track behind
him, if it were possible to avoid it. He was often vainly hunted after
by his own detachments. He was more apt at finding them than they him.
His scouts were taught a peculiar and shrill whistle, which, at night,
could be heard at a most astonishing distance. We are reminded of a
signal of Roderick Dhu:—</p>
<p>“He whistled shrill,</p>
<p>And he was answered from the hill;</p>
<p>Wild as the scream of the curlew,</p>
<p>From crag to crag the signal flew.”</p>
<p>His expeditions were frequently long, and his men, hurrying forth
without due preparation, not unfrequently suffered much privation from
want of food. To guard against this danger, it was their habit to watch
his cook. If they saw him unusually busied in preparing supplies of the
rude, portable food which it was Marion’s custom to carry on such
occasions, they knew what was before them, and provided themselves
accordingly. In no other way could they arrive at their general’s
intentions. His favorite time for moving was with the setting sun, and
then it was known that the march would continue all night.</p>
<p>His men were badly clothed in homespun,—a light wear which afforded
little warmth. They slept in the open air, and frequently without a
blanket. Their ordinary food consisted of sweet potatoes, garnished, on
fortunate occasions, with lean beef. Their swords, unless taken from the
enemy, were made out of mill saws, roughly manufactured by a forest
blacksmith.</p>
<p>His scouts were out in all directions, and at all hours. They did the
double duty of patrol and spies. They hovered about the posts of the
enemy, crouching in the thicket, or darting along the plain, picking up
prisoners, and information, and spoils together. They cut off
stragglers, encountered patrols of the foe, and arrested his supplies on
the way to the garrison. Sometimes the single scout, buried in the thick
tops of the tree, looked down upon the march of his legions, or hung,
perched over the hostile encampment, till it slept; then slipping down,
stole through the silent host, carrying off a drowsy sentinel, or a
favorite charger, upon which the daring spy flourished conspicuous among
his less fortunate companions.</p>

<p>艺术对他的堡垒的舒适和安全毫无助益。这堡垒完全是浑然天成、巧夺天工，这样的栖息地让舍伍德森林众多的英国亡命徒兴高采烈；堡垒周围沟壑纵横，水流环绕，大树和无穷的低矮灌木组成稠密的森林。葡萄藤和荆棘丛看守道路。月桂树和灌木、葡藤与芳香的茉莉花覆盖着他的棚顶，爬上他的眼睑和群星之间。堡垒周围的守护严密，任何敌人都休想攻破帐篷周围路径上的守卫而悄无声息接近这个“天生的绿林好汉”，休想毫不费力地来到他的午夜憩息地。沼泽地是他的护城河，深立的壁垒似天堑，这些关隘有守卫持枪彻夜把守，和莱茵河上的城堡一样坚不可摧。游击队员在他的堡垒里，可以高枕无忧、酣然熟睡。</p>
<p>他的所有行动都打上谨慎敏捷的标志。他不允许出一丝纰漏而冒生命危险。他谨慎和果决的处事习惯达到完美统一。他的事前计划必是先参考弟兄们的感受，合乎众人的条件。为了适应战斗环境，训练感觉，他几乎不眠不睡。在采取行动、拔枪之前，他该对如何玩这个游戏已是了然于心。</p>
<p>当他或他的任何队友离开该岛远征，没有一条平坦的路可走，而是边走边开路。他具备印第安人的所有能力，能根据日月、星辰、犬吠和树顶叶子的颜色判断路线方向，他还有如樵夫那般长期留心所获得的经验，诸如其他自然之物皆可为他的向导，给他指引途径。</p>
<p>远征途中他们开出的许多山径，而今都成了这个国家平常的林荫路。一开始他几乎总是习惯扎进森林，寻找宽阔河道的开始流淌的窄口处，以便跨河而过。如果有桥，他们过河就将桥毁掉。他更喜欢涉水。桥不仅帮助那些不畏死的敌人追赶，而且还会把他自己的行踪暴露给他们。若说敌我征战，速度是首要条件，一条更为直接隐秘、敌人无从追踪的路线则必不可少。</p>
<p>无人知道他下一步做什么，即便是他最信任的随从也不例外。但是他会虚心向他们请教，耐心聆听众人建议并反复权衡，默默地得出自己的结论。众人只有从他的行动中得知他的决定。若可能，他会尽量隐秘，身后不留下可寻痕迹。他的分遣队经常徒劳地在后面追赶他，他更善于找到他们而不是被他们找到。他的侦察兵都学会了吹一种特别尖厉的口哨，深夜哨声在一个不可思议的距离都能听得一清二楚。我现在就想起了罗德里克·杜胡的一个暗号声。</p>
<p>“他吹出尖锐的哨声，</p>
<p>远山传来回应；</p>
<p>荒凉如麻鹬的尖叫，</p>
<p>暗号飞掠了悬崖绝壁。”</p>
<p>他的远征时间一般很长，士兵由于没提前准备匆忙行军，经常食物匮乏、忍饥挨饿。为了预防这类情况，战士们习惯看厨师的行动。如果见他团团转地忙着准备粗糙便于携带的食物——那是马里恩远征时的习惯做法，根据这些迹象，他们就知晓所面临的情况，并做好相应的准备。唯有如此，他们没其他方法能揣摩到将军的意向。他最喜欢日落时动身，凭这个时间他们就知道行军将彻夜不停。</p>
<p>他的战士身穿劣质土布，衣衫单薄而不保暖。他们常常露宿野外席地而卧，连一条避寒的毯子都没有。战士们平常吃几个香甜的土豆就点配菜，偶尔好运吃上一点少得可怜的牛肉。他们的宝刀，除了从敌人身上虏获所得，剩下的都是出自一位森林铁匠之手，用框锯粗制锻造而成。</p>
<p>他的侦察兵遍布四面八方，随时警报。他们身兼两职，既是巡逻也是密探。他们徘徊于敌人岗哨附近，蹲伏于灌木丛中，或突然冲上平原，抓俘虏逼问信息，然后一起杀人灭口。他们丢掉落伍士兵，遇上敌人的巡逻队，就切断运往卫戍部队途中的物资。有时单独行动的侦察兵隐藏树顶浓密的枝叶中，俯视大队人马走过，或者倒悬于敌人的营房上，等到营房齁声大作，悄悄溜下来，偷偷从那群酣睡的人身边走过去，干掉一个昏昏欲睡的哨兵或是盗走一匹中意的军马，而这位胆大包天的密探就在那群不大幸运的“朋友”中间跨上马，堂而皇之地逃之夭夭。</p>

<p>A COMMON THOUGHT</p>
<p>共同的思想</p>
<p>Henry Timrod, 1829-1867, was born at Charleston, South Carolina. He
inherited his father’s literary taste and ability, and had the
advantages of a liberal education. He entered the University of Georgia
before he was seventeen years of age, and while there commenced his
career as a poet. Poverty and ill health compelled him to leave the
university without taking a degree; he then commenced the study of law,
and for ten years taught in various private families. At the outbreak of
the war, in 1860, he warmly espoused the Southern cause, and wrote many
stirring war lyrics. In 1863 he joined the Army of the West, as
correspondent of the Charleston “Mercury,” and in 1864 he became editor
of the “South Carolinian,” published first at Columbia and later at
Charleston. He also served for a time as assistant secretary to Governor
Orr. The advance of Sherman’s army reduced him to poverty, and he was
compelled to the greatest drudgery in order to earn a bare living. His
health soon broke down, and he died of hemorrhage of the lungs. The
following little poem seems, almost, to have been written under a
presentiment, so accurately does it describe the closing incidents of
the poet’s life.</p>
<p>The first volume of Timrod’s poems appeared in 1860. A later edition,
with a memoir of the author, was published in New York in 1873.</p>
<p>Somewhere on this earthly planet</p>
<p>In the dust of flowers that be,</p>
<p>In the dewdrop, in the sunshine,</p>
<p>Sleeps a solemn day for me.</p>
<p>At this wakeful hour of midnight</p>
<p>I behold it dawn in mist,</p>
<p>And I hear a sound of sobbing</p>
<p>Through the darkness,—Hist! oh, hist!</p>
<p>In a dim and musky chamber,</p>
<p>I am breathing life away;</p>
<p>Some one draws a curtain softly,</p>
<p>And I watch the broadening day.</p>
<p>As it purples in the zenith,</p>
<p>As it brightens on the lawn,</p>
<p>There’s a hush of death about me,</p>
<p>And a whisper, “He is gone!”</p>

<p>A DEFINITE AIM IN READING</p>
<p>明确的阅读目标</p>
<p>Noah Porter, 1811-1892, was born at Farmington, Conn., and graduated
at Yale in 1831. He remained in New Haven as a school-teacher, a tutor
in college, and a student in the theological department until 1836, when
he entered the ministry. In 1846 he was recalled to the college as Clark
Professor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics; and in 1858 he also
assumed the duties of the professorship of Systematic Theology, for a
period of seven years. Upon the retirement of President Woolsey in 1871,
he was elected to fill the office, which he held until 1886, being the
eleventh president of the college.</p>
<p>President Porter’s greatest literary work is entitled, “The Human
Intellect: With an Introduction upon Psychology and the Human Soul.” It
is remarkable for the clear thought and sound judgment it displays, as
well as for its broad scholarship; and it has been pronounced “the most
complete and exhaustive exhibition of the cognitive faculties of the
human soul to be found in our language.” His other important works are:
“The Sciences of Nature versus the Science of Man,” which is a review of
the doctrines of Herbert Spencer; “American Colleges and the American
Public;” and the book from which the following selection is taken,
namely, “Books and Reading.” Besides these he wrote numerous essays,
contributions to periodicals, etc. During his professorship he was
called upon to act as chief editor in the important work of revising
“Webster’s Dictionary.” The edition of 1864 was the result of his
careful oversight, and the subsequent revisions were also under his
superintendence.</p>
<p>In reading, we do well to propose to ourselves definite ends and
purposes. The more distinctly we are aware of our own wants and desires
in reading, the more definite and permanent will be our acquisitions.
Hence it is a good rule to ask ourselves frequently, “Why am I reading
this book, essay, or poem? or why am I reading it at the present time
rather than any other?” It may often be a satisfying answer, that it is
convenient; that the book happens to be at hand: or that we read to pass
away the time. Such reasons are often very good, but they ought not
always to satisfy us. Yet the very habit of proposing these questions,
however they may be answered, will involve the calling of ourselves to
account for our reading, and the consideration of it in the light of
wisdom and duty.</p>
<p>The distinct consciousness of some object at present before us,
imparts a manifoldly greater interest to the contents of any volume. It
imparts to the reader an appropriate power, a force of affinity, by
which he insensibly and unconsciously attracts to himself all that has a
near or even a remote relation to the end for which he reads. Anyone is
conscious of this who reads a story with the purpose of repeating it to
an absent friend; or an essay or a report with the design of using its
facts or arguments in a debate; or a poem with the design of reviving
its imagery, and reciting its finest passages. Indeed, one never learns
to read effectively until he learns to read in such a spirit—not always,
indeed, for a definite end, yet always with a mind attent to appropriate
and retain and turn to the uses of culture, if not to a more direct
application.</p>
<p>The private history of every self-educated man, from Franklin
onwards, attests that they all were uniformly not only earnest but
select in their reading, and that they selected their books with
distinct reference to the purposes for which they used them. Indeed, the
reason why self-trained men so often surpass men who are trained by
others in the effectiveness and success of their reading, is that they
know for what they read and study, and have definite aims and wishes in
all their dealings with books. The omnivorous and indiscriminate reader,
who is at the same time a listless and passive reader, however ardent is
his curiosity, can never be a reader of the most effective sort.</p>
<p>Another good rule is suggested by the foregoing. Always have some
solid reading in hand; i. e., some work or author which we carry forward
from one day to another, or one hour of leisure to the next, with
persistence, till we have finished whatever we have undertaken. There
are many great and successful readers who do not observe this rule, but
it is a good rule notwithstanding.</p>
<p>The writer once called upon one of the most extensive and persevering
of modern travelers, at an early hour of the day, to attend him upon a
walk to a distant village. It was after breakfast, and though he had but
few minutes at command, he was sitting with book in hand—a book of solid
history he was perusing day after day. He remarked: “This has been my
habit for years in all my wanderings. It is the one habit which gives
solidity to my intellectual activities and imparts tone to my life. It
is only in this way that I can overcome and counteract the tendency to
the dissipation of my powers and the distraction of my attention, as
strange persons and strange scenes present themselves from day to
day.”</p>
<p>To the rule already given—read with a definite aim—we could add the
rule—make your aims to be definite by continuously holding them rigidly
to a single book at all times, except when relaxation requires you to
cease to work, and to live for amusement and play. Always have at least
one iron in the fire, and kindle the fire at least once every day.</p>
<p>It is implied in the preceding that we should read upon definite
subjects, and with a certain method and proportion in the choice of our
books. If we have a single object to accomplish in our reading for the
present, that object will of necessity direct the choice of what we
read, and we shall arrange our reading with reference to this single
end. This will be a nucleus around which our reading will for the moment
naturally gather and arrange itself.</p>
<p>If several subjects seem to us equally important and interesting, we
should dispose of them in order, and give to each for the time our chief
and perhaps our exclusive attention. That this is wise is so obvious as
not to require illustration. “One thing at a time,” is an accepted
condition for all efficient activity, whether it is employed upon things
or thoughts, upon men or books. If five or ten separate topics have
equal claim upon our interest and attention, we shall do to each the
amplest justice, if we make each in its turn the central subject of our
reading. There is little danger of weariness or monotony from the
workings of such a rule.</p>
<p>Most single topics admit or require a considerable variety of books,
each different from the other, and each supplementing the other. Hence
it is one of the best of practices in prosecuting a course of reading,
to read every author who can cast any light upon the subject which we
have in hand. For example, if we are reading the history of the Great
Rebellion in England, we should read, if we can, not a single author
only, as Clarendon, but a half dozen or a half score, each of whom
writes from his own point of view, supplies what another omits, or
corrects what he under- or overstates.</p>
<p>But, besides the formal histories of the period, there are the
various novels, the scenes and characters of which are placed in those
times, such as Scott’s Woodstock; there are also diaries, such as those
by Evelyn, Pepys, and Burton; and there are memoirs, such as those of
Col. Hutchinson; while the last two have been imitated in scores of
fictions. There are poems, such as those of Andrew Marvell, Milton, and
Dryden. There are also shoals of political tracts and pamphlets, of
handbills and caricatures.</p>
<p>We name these various descriptions of works and classes of reading,
not because we suppose all of them are accessible to those readers who
live at a distance from large public libraries, or because we would
advise everyone who may have access to such libraries, to read all these
books and classes of books as a matter of course, but because we would
illustrate how great is the variety of books and reading matter that are
grouped around a single topic, and are embraced within a single
period.</p>
<p>Every person must judge for himself how long a time he can bestow
upon any single subject, or how many and various are the books in
respect to it which it is wise to read; but of this everyone may be
assured, that it is far easier, far more agreeable, and far more
economical of time and energy, to concentrate the attention upon a
single subject at a time than to extend it to half a score, and that six
books read in succession or together upon a single topic, are far more
interesting and profitable than twice as many which treat of topics
remotely related. A lady well known to the writer, of the least possible
scholarly pretensions or literary notoriety, spent fifteen months of
leisure, snatched by fragments from onerous family cares and brilliant
social engagements, in reading the history of Greece as written by a
great variety of authors and as illustrated by many accessories of
literature and art.</p>
<p>Nor should it be argued that such rules as these, or the habits which
they enjoin, are suitable for scholars only, or for people who have much
leisure for reading. It should rather be urged that those who can read
the fewest books and who have at command the scantiest time, should aim
to read with the greatest concentration and method; should occupy all of
their divided energy with single centers of interest, and husband the
few hours which they can command, in reading whatever converges to a
definite, because to a single, impression.</p>
<h4 id="中文阅读-584">中文阅读</h4>
<p>在阅读之中，我们最好给自己提出明确的目的和意图。对阅读的需要和愿望越是明确，我们通过阅读所得知识就越深刻持久。因此不断地要求自己是个好习惯，“我为什么看这本书，这篇散文，这首诗？或是我为什么是在现在而非其他时候读它呢？”答案可能常常令我们满意，因为方便有闲；因为这本书碰巧就在手边；或是看书为了打发时间。这样的理由是很好，但我们不该总拿这样的理由满足自己。这种不管结论如何仍然提出问题的习惯，会让我们询问自己阅读的理由，并在智慧与责任的启发下唤醒阅读的真谛。</p>
<p>我们对眼前的某些目标有清楚的意识，激发了我们对所有书籍的内容都产生了极大的兴趣。这让读者具备了一种适当的能力，对他们产生了一种吸引力，让他们不知不觉沉浸其中，从阅读中联想到身边所有直接联系甚或只有遥远关系的事物。任何人都能意识到这一点，实际上他看书时，是与不在场的朋友重述一个故事；或是利用事实构想一篇散文，一篇报道，在一场辩论中争议；或是再现意象之诗情，在背诵最优美的片段。一个人直到学会用心看书才懂得看书的效用——确实，读书不是经常会有明确目标，但总要转向文化的运用。</p>
<p>每位自学者的个人历史，从前面的富兰克林说起，一致地证明阅读不仅要认真，还要有选择性，而且他们选择的读物都有明确的阅读目标。这就是为什么自学者多数比那些靠他人指导阅读更有成效的原因，那是因为他们明白为何读，为什么目的而学，对涉及的所有书籍都有明确的阅读计划和希望。读书随意而驳杂的读者，同时也是个疲倦消极的读者，无论对书籍的好奇心有多热烈，他永远成不了读书最富成效的那一个。</p>
<p>另一个行之有效的法则前面已经提到。手边始终要有可供连续阅读的书；例如某些作品或作者，我们得一天一天地翻阅，或不论从事什么，就是抽出一个小时的闲暇也要看书，持之以恒直到将一本书读完。许多成功的读者没有留意过这个规则，但这仍不失为一条好规则。</p>
<p>笔者曾拜访过一位不畏险阻、坚持不懈到各地周游的当代旅行家，那天一大早，他要徒步去一个很远的村庄。那是早饭后，虽然离出发还有几分钟时间，他还是坐在那儿手握一卷，细读一本天天要看的历史专著。他说：“在我的整个流浪生涯中养成了看书的习惯，已经多年了。正是这个习惯给我的才智输送了雄厚的活力，给我的生活定下一种基调。因为日复一日，总有陌生的人和奇怪的场景出现，我只有用这个办法才能克制精力的浪费，抵消不必要的事物分散我的注意力。</p>
<p>就已谈到的规则——看书要有明确的目标，我们可以再加上一条——除了休息需要以及生活消遣不得不终止阅读，你应随时有一本书在手，通过持续不断地掌握知识来确立你的目标。就好比你的火炉里始终至少有一块铁，每天至少将点燃的炉火熊熊燃烧一次。”</p>
<p>先前已经提及，我们看书应依据明确的学科，有一个确定的阅读方法和选书比例。若是有一本读物暂时读完，那么通过这本书我们就应该明确下一本看什么，并参照这一个目标安排读本。这个目标是一个核心，阅读本身就自然而然围绕这个核心聚拢排列。</p>
<p>如果几个主题似乎同等重要有趣，我们就应有序安排，每个学科都拿出时间专心对待。显而易见，这就是明智的做法，不需要我举例说明。“一次只做一件事”对各种高效行动而言都是一个公认的先决条件，无论是做事还是思考问题，不论是对人还是书籍，这个道理皆可适用。如果有五或十个话题诉诸于我们的兴趣和关注，我们应该对每个主题非常公平，让每个主题轮流成为我们的阅读中心。按照这个规则，就不会觉得读书学习疲劳乏味，反而会觉得其乐无穷。</p>
<p>大多数单个主题可容纳或需要相当繁杂的书籍，每一类相互有别又互为补充。因此，制定一个阅读课程是最好的方法，对手边所有主题能给我们启发的作家的作品，我们要一一拜读。例如，若我们在读“英国内战史”，可能的话，我们就不应该只读一个作家的著作，像卡拉兰顿，而是读六七位作者的评价，每一个作家都以自己的观点阐述这段历史，对他人的疏漏补阙拾遗或纠正偏颇。</p>
<p>但是，除了正史以外，还有各种以那个时代为背景的小说，其中的场景和人物都基于那个时代而设置，比如斯科特的《伍德斯托克》；还有日记可供参考，诸如伊芙琳、佩皮斯和波顿等人的日记，还有那个时代的回忆录可供对照，比如科尔·哈钦森的著述；不过波顿的日记和哈钦森的回忆录都有虚构的成分。还有描写那个时代的诗歌，譬如安德鲁·马维尔、米尔顿和屈莱顿的诗章。还有与内乱有关的大批政论性文章和小册子、传单和漫画，均可参照。</p>
<p>我们提出各种各样的著作摘要和读本分类，并非是想当然地认为，那些远离大型公众图书馆的读者都能悉数读到，也并非理所当然地劝有条件的人都去这样的图书馆，看这些书籍和分类读本，而是想举例说明，围绕这一个主题包含这一个时期的各种书籍和读物何其浩繁。</p>
<p>所以每个人都必须做出判断，任何一个主题能抽出多少时间，或者读多少涉及这一主题的不同书籍才算是明智之举；但每个人都应该明白，一段时间将注意力集中在一个主题上要比同时分散到十个主题上容易和舒适得多、而且在时间和精力上也更加划算，就一个主题的六本书放在一起连续阅读，比将许多主题关联不大的书一起看有趣得多。一位相当熟悉笔者的女士，她完全不是为了装出有学问的样子，也并非为了获取文名，却花费了15个月的闲暇，抓住繁重家务活之余的所有时间，戒绝精彩的社交约会，潜心阅读了大量不同作家创作的希腊历史著作，旁及许多希腊文学和艺术阐述材料。</p>
<p>毋庸置疑，诸如这些读书的规则或习惯，不仅适合学者以及那些有许多闲暇看书的人。对那些读书很少、缺乏空闲的人来说，更应该专注于一个主题，注意阅读方法；将所有分散的精力和能掌握的时间，集中于一项兴趣的中心，汇聚到一个明确的阅读效果中。</p>

<p>ODE TO MT. BLANC</p>
<p>咏白朗峰</p>
<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 1772-1834, was born in Devonshire, England,
and was educated at Christ’s Hospital and Cambridge University. Through
poverty he was compelled to enlist in the army, but his literary
attainments soon brought him into notice, and he was enabled to withdraw
from the distasteful life.</p>
<p>Coleridge’s fame arises chiefly from his poems, of which the “Rime of
the Ancient Mariner,” “Genevieve,” and “Christabel” may be classed among
the best of English poetry. He also wrote a number of dramas, besides
numerous essays on religious and political topics. As a
conversationalist Coleridge had a remarkable reputation, and among his
ardent admirers and friends may be ranked Southey, Wordsworth, Lovell,
Lamb, and De Quincey. He and his friends Southey and Lovell married
sisters, and talked at one time of founding a community on the banks of
the Susquehanna. Although possessing such brilliant natural gifts,
Coleridge fell far short of what he might have attained, through a great
lack of energy and application, increased by an excessive use of
opium.</p>
<p>Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star</p>
<p>In his steep course? So long he seems to pause</p>
<p>On thy bald, awful head, O sovran Blanc!</p>
<p>The Arve and Arveiron at thy base</p>
<p>Rave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful Form,</p>
<p>Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines,</p>
<p>How silently! Around thee and above,</p>
<p>Deep is the air and dark, substantial, black—</p>
<p>An ebon mass: methinks thou piercest it,</p>
<p>As with a wedge! But when I look again,</p>
<p>It is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine,</p>
<p>Thy habitation from eternity!</p>
<p>O dread and silent Mount! I gazed upon thee</p>
<p>Till thou, still present to the bodily sense,</p>
<p>Didst vanish from my thoughts: entranced in prayer,</p>
<p>I worshiped the Invisible alone.</p>
<p>Yet, like some sweet, beguiling melody,</p>
<p>So sweet we know not we are listening to it,</p>
<p>Thou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my thought—</p>
<p>Yea, with my life and life’s own secret joy</p>
<p>Till the dilating soul, enrapt, transfused,</p>
<p>Into the mighty vision passing—there,</p>
<p>As in her natural form, swelled vast to Heaven!</p>
<p>Awake, my soul! not only passive praise</p>
<p>Thou owest! not alone these swelling tears,</p>
<p>Mute thanks and secret ecstasy! Awake,</p>
<p>Voice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake!</p>
<p>Green vales and icy cliffs, all join my hymn.</p>
<p>Thou first and chief, sole sovran of the vale!</p>
<p>Oh, struggling with the darkness all the night,</p>
<p>And visited all night by troops of stars,</p>
<p>Or when they climb the sky, or when they sink—</p>
<p>Companion of the morning star at dawn,</p>
<p>Thyself Earth’s rosy star, and of the dawn</p>
<p>Coherald—wake, oh wake, and utter praise!</p>
<p>Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth?</p>
<p>Who filled thy countenance with rosy light?</p>
<p>Who made thee parent of perpetual streams?</p>
<p>And you, ye five wild torrents fiercely glad!</p>
<p>Who called you forth from night and utter death,</p>
<p>From dark and icy caverns called you forth,</p>
<p>Down those precipitous, black, jagged rocks,</p>
<p>Forever shattered, and the same forever?</p>
<p>Who gave you your invulnerable life,</p>
<p>Your strength, your speed, your fury, and your joy,</p>
<p>Unceasing thunder, and eternal foam?</p>
<p>And who commanded (and the silence came),</p>
<p>Here let the billows stiffen, and have rest?</p>
<p>Ye icefalls! ye that from the mountain’s brow</p>
<p>Adown enormous ravines slope amain—</p>
<p>Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,</p>
<p>And stopped at once amid their maddest plunge!</p>
<p>Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!</p>
<p>Who made you glorious as the gates of Heaven</p>
<p>Beneath the keen full moon? Who bade the sun</p>
<p>Clothe you with rainbows? Who, with living flowers</p>
<p>Of loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet?</p>
<p>God!—let the torrents, like a shout of nations,</p>
<p>Answer! and let the ice plains echo, God!</p>
<p>God! sing ye meadow streams with gladsome voice!</p>

<p>Utter forth, God, and fill the hills with praise!</p>
<p>Thou, too, hoar Mount! with thy sky-pointing peaks,</p>
<p>Oft from whose feet the avalanche, unheard,</p>
<p>Shoots downward, glittering through the pure serene,</p>
<p>Into the depth of clouds that veil thy breast—</p>
<p>Thou too again, stupendous Mountain! thou</p>
<p>That as I raise my head, awhile bowed low</p>
<p>In adoration, upward from thy base,</p>
<p>Slow traveling, with dim eyes suffused with tears,</p>
<p>Solemnly seemest, like a vapory cloud,</p>
<p>To rise before me.—Rise, oh ever rise!</p>
<p>Rise like a cloud of incense from the Earth!</p>
<p>Thou kingly spirit throned among the hills,</p>
<p>Thou dread embassador from Earth to Heaven,</p>
<p>Great Hierarch! tell thou the silent sky,</p>
<p>And tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun,</p>
<p>Earth, with her thousand voices, praises God.</p>

<p>难道你有魅力吸引启明星</p>
<p>停止他那迅疾的步履？那么久，他好像停在</p>
<p>你光秃而庄严的头顶。哦，傲视天下的白朗峰！</p>
<p>阿沃尔河与阿沃阿伦河在你脚下</p>
<p>咆哮不休；而你以威严的姿态，</p>
<p>挥漾你的松林之海，</p>
<p>多么寂静！你的四周、你的头顶，</p>
<p>深深的，是穹隆，与黑压压的</p>
<p>乌木林；那山峰好像你</p>
<p>插入云霄的楔子！然而当我再次仰望，</p>
<p>那天宇如是你的家园，你的水晶殿，安宁神圣，</p>
<p>你所居兮永恒国度！</p>
<p>哦威严静寂的白朗峰！凝望你</p>
<p>直到你，将这具肉身的俗念，</p>
<p>化于宁静；我深深祈祷，</p>
<p>向缥缈无形的圣灵致敬。</p>
<p>然而，像悦耳迷人的旋律，</p>
<p>那么亲切，令人忘我地倾听，</p>
<p>你，同时融入我的思想</p>
<p>是的，用我的生命与生命神秘的快乐</p>
<p>直至膨胀的灵魂，痴迷地注入</p>
<p>眼前巨大的幻象——在那边</p>
<p>以她自然之形，无限隆起，直抵天际！</p>
<p>醒来吧，我痴迷的灵魂！不仅热情地赞美</p>
<p>对你的感激！不只是这感恩的泪水汹涌奔流，</p>
<p>无言的感激和神秘的狂喜！唱响吧，</p>
<p>甜美的歌声！醒来，我迷醉的心灵，欢呼吧！</p>
<p>苍翠峡谷，冰雪山峰，所有生命同我一起高歌欢颂。</p>
<p>你是魁首，你是峡谷唯一的君主！</p>
<p>哦，你整夜与黑暗斗争，</p>
<p>长夜星群把你守候，</p>
<p>当他们爬上天堂，或沉入夜空</p>
<p>还有启明星为你做伴，</p>
<p>你本是大地的玫瑰明星，黎明的</p>
<p>传令先锋——醒来，哦醒来，高声赞颂！</p>
<p>是谁把你的砥柱深深插入泥土？</p>
<p>是谁让你的面容洋溢玫瑰样的晕红？</p>
<p>是谁让你孕育了源源不断的溪流？</p>
<p>你，为那五条湍湍急流狂喜！</p>
<p>水浪把你从黑夜激醒，念动死亡咒语，</p>
<p>从幽暗冰封的洞穴呼唤你，</p>
<p>激流坠落险峻、阴沉交错的岩石上，</p>
<p>不停拍打，就这样重复不止？</p>
<p>谁赐你坚不可摧的生命，</p>
<p>谁赠你力量、速度，谁惹你暴怒，令你欢喜，</p>
<p>不停轰鸣，水沫飞溅不绝不息？</p>
<p>谁在发号施令（寂静来临），</p>
<p>巨浪翻腾，又归于平静？</p>
<p>你那绝美的冰瀑！你那自山巅</p>
<p>顺着险恶的峡谷倾泻疾下的</p>
<p>奔流，在我眼里，它听到一声巨响，</p>
<p>立刻刹住狂暴的脚步，停止前行！</p>
<p>静止的倾注！寂静的大瀑布！</p>
<p>谁让你优雅如天堂的大门</p>
<p>笼罩白月的清冷？谁令灿阳</p>
<p>给你披上彩虹？是谁，将鲜艳欲滴的蓝花</p>
<p>编成花环，一个个摆放你的山脚下？</p>
<p>上帝！让这奔流，就像国家的呼喊，</p>
<p>来回答！让这冰川的回响，上帝！</p>
<p>上帝！溪流欢快地在你的草地上歌唱！</p>
<p>你的松树丛林，充满你轻柔的发自灵魂的声音！</p>
<p>还有其他的声音，那边危险的雪堆，</p>
<p>发出即将爆裂的轰轰巨响，上帝呀！</p>
<p>你那冷艳的蓝色冰凌花，冰雪不融！</p>
<p>你那野山羊在苍鹰的安乐窝周围，戏耍欢蹦！</p>
<p>你那苍鹰，是山风暴雨的玩伴！</p>
<p>你那闪电，是可怕的云之箭镞！</p>
<p>你是自然力量的标志、是奇观！</p>
<p>上帝大声说，誉满山谷丘陵！</p>
<p>你也是，满头白雪的山峰！直指苍穹，</p>
<p>雪崩常自山底爆发，前所未闻的力量，</p>
<p>雪山轰然坍塌，映射纯阳冰雪，如此璀璨，</p>
<p>进入云层深处，白云遮掩了你的胸膛，</p>
<p>你再一次令人惊叹，你这奇山巨峰！你</p>
<p>让我敬畏地仰望，片刻又满心爱慕</p>
<p>慢慢低首，从山底，</p>
<p>缓步上行，两眼含泪，视线模糊，</p>
<p>神情庄重，似乎一团缭绕的云雾，</p>
<p>在眼前升起。升腾，哦永远升腾！</p>
<p>升腾，就像香雾在尘世间袅袅上升！</p>
<p>你如登上宝座统领群峰的国王，</p>
<p>你是尘世与天堂的使节，</p>
<p>哦！伟大的君主！请告诉你那寂静的天穹，</p>
<p>告诉群星，和那冉冉上升的太阳，</p>
<p>世间，有千万声音，在把上帝颂扬。</p>
