Aside Why Don’t We Have Better Medication Against Viruses?</h4>
<p>One thing you might have asked yourself, especially in the context of
the global COVID-19 pandemic: why don’t we just have good medication
against viruses? Why is it that we have so many different antibiotics
that protect us from most types of bacteria, from the plague to urinary
tract infections to blood poisoning, but nothing really great against
the flu, the common cold, or the coronavirus? Well, here we encounter a
fundamental problem: viruses are too similar to our own cells. Wait.
What? Well, they are not similar in the sense that a virus is similar to
a cell, but in the sense that viruses mimic or work with your own
parts.</p>
<p>In our modern times, we are used to the idea that medicine will
figure things out. We are largely free from dangerous infectious
diseases in developed countries and so the fact that we don’t have
effective medication that helps with virus infections is a bit
irritating to learn. Why is that? It is best to demonstrate this with
bacteria, living beings that we diverged from a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>Let us use this moment to explain how antibiotics work. Like
Prometheus who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity and made
it more powerful, scientists stole antibiotics from nature to make it
live longer. In the wild, antibiotics are typically natural compounds
that microbes use to kill other microbes. Basically the swords and guns
of the microworld. The first successful antibiotic, penicillin, is a
weapon from the mold Penicillium rubens that works by blocking
bacteria’s ability to make cell walls. As a bacterium tries to grow and
divide it needs to produce more cell walls and Penicillium has a shape
that interrupts this construction process and prevents the bacteria from
making more of itself. The reason why you can safely be treated with
penicillin is that your cells don’t have cell walls! Your cells are
lined with membranes, which is a fundamentally different structure, so
the drug doesn’t do anything to your cells.</p>
<p>Another antibiotic you may have heard of is Tetracycline, which was
stolen from a bacteria called Streptomyces aureofaciens and works by
inhibiting protein synthesis. If you cast your mind back to how proteins
are made, you’ll recall something called a ribosome. Ribosomes are the
structures that turn mRNA into proteins. So they are fundamental to the
survival in both human and bacterial cells, because without new
proteins, a cell must die. Human and bacterial ribosomes are different
in shape and as a consequence of this difference, although they
basically do the same thing, Tetracycline is able to inhibit bacterial
ribosomes and not yours.*2</p>
<p>So in a nutshell, bacterial cells are very different from your cells.
They use different proteins to stay alive, they build different
structures like special walls, and they reproduce differently than your
cells. And some of these differences present great opportunities for us
to attack and kill them. A good drug is basically a molecule that
connects to the specific shape of a part of an enemy (not too dissimilar
to an antigen and a receptor!) that is not present in your body. In
principle, this is how many drugs and antibiotics work. They attack a
difference in shape between bacterial and human parts.</p>
<p>OK, yeah, sure, so what is the big deal here, why don’t we have drugs
against viruses? Well, we have them. Actually we have thousands of
different drugs that can treat viral infections. The only catch is that
most of them are pretty dangerous and sometimes even deadly to us. Many
are really more like a desperate last resort, the kind of thing that
only gets used when the life of the patient is already on the line.</p>
<p>Think about the nature of a virus. Viruses can be attacked in two
places, outside of your cells and inside of cells. If you want to attack
them outside of your cells, then you basically have to attack the
proteins they use to connect to the receptors of your cell. The huge,
monumental problem with that, is that if you do this, you may just have
created a drug that will also connect to a lot of parts inside your
body. Because to connect to one of your receptors a virus needs to mimic
a part of your body. A part that fulfills some sort of vital function.
If you develop a drug that attacks a virus that connects to this
receptor it is likely that it will target all the parts of your body
that are supposed to connect to the receptor. It is the same inside your
cells—we can’t make antiviral drugs that target different metabolic
processes of a virus, like for example the ribosome. Because this is our
ribosome the virus is using. A virus is in a perverse way very similar
to us because it uses our own parts to make more of itself.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 If a fever reaches 104°F (40°C) it becomes dangerous for humans
and you should immediately seek out medical attention. Around 107.6°F
(42°C) your brain is starting to get damaged but this is very rare and
seldom a side effect of disease, as the body will usually stop itself
from getting too hot.</p>
<p>*2 Hey, time for an exception! You do have bacteria-like ribosomes in
almost all of your cells. Remember that your mitochondria, the
powerhouse of the cell, were ancient bacteria in the past. Because they
have kept their own ribosome Tetracycline can also disrupt them, which
is not great and leads to pretty unpleasant side effects. One more
reason why we need a diverse set of antibiotics.</p>
