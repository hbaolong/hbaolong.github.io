<h4 id="smelling-the-building-blocks-of-life">11 Smelling the Building
Blocks of Life</h4>
<p>One of the first things we learned was that your Innate Immune System
distinguishes self from other. But how does the Innate Immune System
know what and who to attack? Who is self and who is other? And more
specifically, how do your soldier cells know what a bacterium smells
like? As we discussed earlier, one of the biggest advantages
microorganisms have over multicellular animals is the rapid pace at
which they are able to change and adapt. As multicellular life has been
in competition with microorganisms for hundreds of millions of years
now—why didn’t bacteria find ways to start hiding their smell? The
answer lies in the structures that make living things.</p>
<p>All life on earth is made from the same fundamental molecule types
that are arranged in different ways: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins,
and nucleic acids. These basic molecules interact and fit together to
create structures and these structures are the building blocks of life
on earth. We discussed the most important building block already quite a
bit, proteins. So for simplicity, we will focus on proteins here as they
account for the majority of building blocks—this does not mean the
others are not important but the principle is mostly the same and it is
helpful to zero in on something.</p>
<p>As we said before, the shape of a protein determines what it can do
and how it can interact with other proteins, what structures it can
build, and what information it can convey. Every shape is a little bit
like a 3D puzzle piece that, together with other pieces, makes up the
overall puzzle. Puzzle pieces are a good way to imagine protein shapes
because they make something else clear too: Only certain shapes can
connect with other certain shapes. But if they do, they fit together
quite nicely and firmly. Since there are billions upon billions of
different possible protein shapes, life has a large variety of pieces to
choose from when it wants to build a new living thing—say for example, a
bacterium. There are a lot of different bacteria you could build from
the available protein puzzle pieces of life. Except actually there are
limitations to that freedom.</p>
<p>For some specific jobs, the protein puzzle pieces of life can’t be
altered and still keep their function. It doesn’t matter how much a
bacterium mutates or what new sort of clever protein combination it
comes up with: There are certain proteins that it can’t stop using if it
wants to be a bacterium. Like, for example, you can make a car in many
different forms and colors. But you will not really escape the fact that
you need wheels and screws if you want to have a car in the end. It’s
the same for bacteria. Your immune system is using this fact to
recognize if something is self or other. So how does this work in
reality?</p>
<p>A great example is the flagellum. Flagella are micromachines that
some species of bacteria and microorganisms use to move. They are long
protein propellers attached to the bacteria’s tiny butts that are able
to rotate fast and propel the tiny being forward. Not all bacteria have
them, but many do. It is a pretty ingenious way to move around in the
microworld, especially if you are living in shallow and stale water.
Human cells do not use them at all.*</p>
<p>So if an immune cell recognizes that something has a flagellum, it
knows that this something is 100% other and has to be killed. So over
hundreds of millions of years, the innate immune system of many animals
evolved to sort of save the shapes of certain puzzle pieces that are
used only by enemies like bacteria. For a lack of a better word, it
“knows” that certain puzzle pieces always mean trouble. Of course, your
cells don’t know anything because they are stupid. But they have
receptors! And it so happens that your innate immune cells have
receptors that can recognize the protein puzzle shapes that make up
flagella, and will enable the immune cells to eliminate them.</p>
<p>The proteins that make up the flagellum of a bacterium are the
matching puzzle pieces for the receptors on our immune soldiers. When a
Macrophage receptor connects to a bacterium protein that fits, two
things happen: The Macrophage gets a tight grip on the bacteria and it
also triggers a cascade inside the cell that lets it know that it found
an enemy and that it should swallow! This basic mechanism is at the core
of how your innate immune system knows who is an enemy or not.</p>
<p>Now, the flagellum protein is not the only kind of protein puzzle
piece your immune soldiers can recognize. Your innate immune system can
recognize quite a variety of proteins with a few receptors. Just like
with cytokines, these special receptors work a bit like sensory organs,
like protein recognition machines. It’s a very simple mechanism really:
Receptors themselves are special puzzle pieces, able to connect to
another puzzle piece—which in this case, means the shape of flagella
proteins. If the Macrophage is able to connect, it goes into kill
mode.</p>
<p>This is how your innate immune cells are able to recognize bacteria,
even if they never have encountered a specific species ever before.
Every bacteria has some proteins that it can’t get rid of. And your
innate immune cells come equipped with a very special group of receptors
that are able to recognize all the most common puzzle pieces of our
enemies:</p>
<p>Toll-Like Receptors—their discovery was worth two Nobel Prizes.
“Toll” means “great” or “amazing” in German and it is a very fitting
name for this extremely amazing information device. The immune system of
all animals has some variant of Toll-Like Receptors, which makes it one
of the oldest parts of the immune system that evolved probably more than
half a billion years ago. Some toll-like receptors can recognize the
shape of flagella, others certain nooks and crannies on viruses, others
again telltale signs of danger and chaos, like free-floating DNA.</p>
<p>Neither bacteria, viruses, protozoa, nor fungi can completely hide
from these receptors no matter what they do. There are toll-like
receptors that do not even have to touch an enemy directly. As we said
in the beginning of this chapter, bacteria stink. Just by doing their
thing and being alive, microorganisms will sort of sweat out proteins
and other garbage that can be picked up by your immune cell receptors,
and which give their presence and identity away. As great as it would be
for bacteria not to do that, they can’t avoid it entirely. Your innate
immune system has evolved alongside bacteria for hundreds of millions of
years and learned to sniff around for these specific bacteria puzzle
pieces. This mechanism enables Neutrophils and Macrophages to detect
them, even without knowing what kind of bacteria has entered your body.
They just recognize the odor of enemies and that they need to have their
heads bashed in.</p>
<p>This principle of cells identifying the puzzle pieces of enemies with
sort of sensory receptors on their surfaces is called microbial pattern
recognition and it will become even more important later on for the
adaptive immune system, which uses the same basic mechanism, but in a
much more ingenious way.</p>
<p>OK!</p>
<p>Enough explanations of principles. Equipped with this knowledge we
can revisit our battlefield and get to know another one of the most
powerful and cruel weapons of your innate immune system. A weapon that
is tiny even for cells and bacteria.</p>
<p>Remember when you were hiking and stepped on the nail, how that
invisible army appeared and just started maiming and killing enemies as
fluid from the blood flooded the battlefield during inflammation? Well,
it’s time to learn what it was. Unfortunately it is cursed with one of
the worst names in immunology: The Complement System.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>OK no, this is actually not true! Sperm cells do use a long and
powerful flagellum to move forward (which are technically different
structures that work differently but are called the same because hey,
biology is not confusing enough apparently). But sperm is a fascinating
example in any case. Think about it, why does the body of a woman not
recognize sperm cells as other and kill them right away? Well, it does!
This is one of the reasons you need about 200 million sperm cells to
fertilize a single egg! Right after sperm is delivered into the vagina,
it is confronted with a hostile environment that it has to deal with.
The vagina is a pretty acidic and deadly place for visitors, so sperm
cells move on as fast as possible to escape it. Most of them gain access
to the cervix and uterus within a few minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although here they are greeted by an onslaught of Macrophages and
Neutrophils that kill the majority of the friendly visitors that are
only trying to do their job. Sperm cells are at least a bit equipped to
deal with the hostile immune system (a little like a specialized
pathogen if you think about it). They release a number of molecules and
substances aimed at suppressing the angry immune cells around them, to
buy them a little bit of time. And it may actually be the case that they
are able to communicate with the cells that line the uterus, to let them
know that they are friendly visitors, which might turn down
inflammation. But there is a surprisingly large number of things that
are not completely understood yet, in these interactions. In any case,
from the millions of sperm cells that entered, only a few hundred enter
the fallopian tubes and get a shot at fertilizing the egg.</p>
<p>12 The Invisible Killer Army: The Complement System</p>
<p>The Complement System is the most important part of your immune
system that you have never heard of. Which is pretty weird because so
much of your immune system is made to interact with it and if it doesn’t
work properly the consequences for your health are immense and quite
dire.</p>
<p>The complement system is one of the oldest parts of your immune
system, as we have evidence that it evolved in the oldest multicellular
animals on earth, more than 500 million years ago. In a sense, it is the
most basic form of any animal’s immune response, but it is also very
effective. Evolution does not like to preserve useless things, so the
fact that the complement system has been in place for that long, without
changing that much, shows how incredibly valuable it is for your
survival. Not only has it not been replaced as organisms have become
more complex, your other immune defenses have become fine-tuned to make
it more powerful.</p>
<p>One of the reasons the complement system is largely unknown is that
it is mind-numbingly and head-explodingly unintuitive and complex. Even
people who need to learn about it in depth in university can struggle
with getting a clear mental image of all its different processes and
interactions. No part of immunology has been cursed with worse and more
difficult-to-remember names for its parts. Luckily, understanding and
remembering all its details are wholly unnecessary for anyone who is not
studying advanced immunology. So we are going to brush over a lot of
details because we can and life is too short for stuff like this. If you
are the type of person who would like to know the details, there are
illustrated diagrams with all the correct names and mechanisms.</p>
<p>OK cool, but what IS the complement system?</p>
<p>Basically the complement system is an army of over thirty different
proteins (not cells!) that work together in an elegant dance to stop
strangers from having a good time inside your body. All in all, about
FIFTEEN QUINTILLION complement proteins are saturating every fluid of
your body right now. Complement proteins are tiny and they are
everywhere. Even a virus looks reasonably large next to them. If a cell
were the size of a human, a complement protein would barely be the size
of a fruit fly egg. Since it is even less able to think and make
decisions than your cells are, it is guided by absolutely nothing but
chemistry. And yet it is able to fulfill a variety of different
objectives.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the complement system does three things:</p>
<p>It maims enemies and makes their lives miserable and unfun.</p>
<p>It activates immune cells and guides them to invaders so they can
kill them.</p>
<p>It rips holes into things until they die.</p>
<p>But how? After all, these are just a lot of mindless proteins,
randomly drifting around without will or direction. But this is actually
part of the strategy. Complement proteins float around in a sort of
passive mode. They do nothing, until they get activated. Imagine
complement proteins as millions of matches that are stacked very close
together. If a single match catches fire, it will ignite the matches
around it, these ignite more, and suddenly you have a huge fire.</p>
<p>In the world of complement proteins, catching fire means changing
their shape. As we said before, the shape of a protein determines what
it can and can’t do, what they can interact with, and in what way. In
their passive shape complement proteins do nothing. In their active
shape, however, they can change the shape of other complement proteins
and activate them.</p>
<p>This simple mechanism can cause self-enforcing cascades. One protein
activates another. Those two activate four, which activate eight, which
activate sixteen. Very soon, you have thousands of active proteins. As
we learned briefly when we talked about the cell, proteins move
extremely fast. So within seconds complement proteins can go from being
totally useless to an active and unavoidable weapon that is spreading
explosively.</p>
<p>Let’s look at what this looks like in reality. Think back to the
battlefield, the injury from the nail. A huge amount of damage was done
and the Macrophages and Neutrophils ordered inflammation, which made the
blood vessels release fluid into the battlefield. This fluid carries
millions of complement proteins that quickly saturate the wound. Now the
first match needs to catch fire.</p>
<p>In reality, this means that a specific and very important complement
protein needs to change its shape. It has the amazingly useless name
“C3.” How C3 changes its shape and activates exactly is complex, boring,
and not important right now, so let us just pretend it happens randomly,
by pure lucky chance.<em>1</em>2</p>
<p>All you really need to know is that C3 is sort of the most important
complement part, the first match that needs to catch fire to start the
cascade. When it does, it breaks into two smaller proteins with
different shapes that are now activated. The first match is lit!</p>
<p>One of these C3 parts, very creatively called C3b, is like a seeker
missile. It has a fraction of a second to find a victim or it will be
neutralized and shut itself off. If it does find a target, say a
bacterium, it anchors itself very tightly to the bacterium’s surface and
does not let go. By doing so the C3b protein changes its shape again,
which gives it new powers and abilities. (In a way complement proteins
are like mini protein Transformers.) In its new form it is able to grab
other complement proteins, change their shape, and merge with them.
After a few steps it has transformed itself into a recruiting
platform.</p>
<p>This platform is an expert at activating more C3 complement proteins
that start the whole cycle anew. An amplification loop begins. The cycle
of activation and new shapes starts over and over and over. More and
more newly activated C3b attaches to the bacteria, creates new
recruitment platforms, and activates even more C3. Within a few seconds
of the first complement protein activating, thousands of proteins cover
the bacterium all over. For the bacterium this is very bad. Imagine you
would go through the day, minding your business, and suddenly hundreds
of thousands of flies, in unison, covered your skin, head to toe. This
would be a horrifying experience and not something you could just
ignore. For a bacterium, this process can cripple and maim it, making it
helpless and slowing it down considerably.</p>
<p>But there is more—do you remember the other part that broke off C3?
This one is called C3a, because why not, I guess. It is like a distress
beacon, just like the cytokines that we discussed two chapters ago. It
is a message, an alarm signal. Thousands of C3a flood away from the site
of battle, screaming for attention. Passive immune cells like
Macrophages or Neutrophils begin smelling them, picking them up with
special receptors, and awake from their slumber to follow the protein
tracks to the site of infection. The more active alarm complement
proteins they encounter, the more aggressive they get, because active
complement always means that something bad triggered them. The trail of
C3a complement guides them exactly to the place where they are needed
the most. In that case, complement does exactly the same job as
cytokines, only that they are passively generated and don’t need to be
generated by cells, like cytokines do.</p>
<p>So far the complement has slowed down the invaders (C3b flies
covering their skin) and called for help (C3a distress beacons). Now the
complement system begins to actively help to kill the enemy. As we
discussed before, the soldier cells are phagocytes, cells that swallow
enemies whole. But to swallow an enemy they need to grab it first. Which
is not as easy as we made it out to be. Because bacteria prefer not to
be grabbed and try to slip away.</p>
<p>And even if they didn’t insist on trying to not be killed, there is a
sort of physics problem: The membranes of cells and bacteria are
negatively charged—and as we learned from playing with magnets, the same
charges repel each other. This charge is not so strong that it can’t be
overcome by a phagocyte, but it does make it considerably harder for
immune cells to grab bacteria.</p>
<p>But!</p>
<p>Complement has a positive charge. So when complement proteins have
anchored themselves to the bacteria, they act as a sort of superglue, or
better, little handles, that make it much easier for your immune cells
to grab and hold on to their victims. A bacterium covered in complement
is easy prey for soldier immune cells and in a way, much tastier! This
process is called opsonization, which comes from an old Greek word for a
delicious side dish. So if an enemy is opsonized, it is made more
delicious.</p>
<p>But it gets even better. Imagine being covered in flies again. Now
imagine the flies turning into wasps in the blink of an eye. Another
cascade is about to begin. This one will be deadly. On the surface of
the bacteria the C3 recruitment platform changes its shape again and
starts to activate another group of complement proteins. Together they
begin the construction of a larger structure: A Membrane Attack Complex,
which, I promise, is the only good name within the complement system.
Piece by piece, new complement proteins, formed like long spears, anchor
themselves deep in the bacteria’s surface, impossible to remove. They
stretch and squeeze, until they rip a hole into it, one that can’t be
closed again. A literal wound. Fluids rush into the bacterium and its
insides spill out. Which makes it die quite quickly.</p>
<p>But while bacteria are not happy about complement, the enemy it might
be the most useful against are actually viruses. Viruses have a problem,
namely that they are tiny floaty things and need to travel from cell to
cell. Outside of cells, they are basically hoping to randomly bump
against the right cell to infect it by pure chance, which also makes
them virtually defenseless as they float around. And here complement is
able to intercept and cripple them so they become harmless. Without
complement, virus infections would be a lot more deadly. But more on
viruses later.</p>
<p>Back in our nail-inflicted wound, millions of complement proteins
have maimed or killed hundreds of bacteria, making it much easier for
your Neutrophils and Macrophages to clean them up. The fewer bacteria
the complement proteins find to attach to, the fewer get activated. And
so, the complement activity slows down again. When there are no more
enemies around, complement just becomes a passive and invisible weapon
again. The complement system is a beautiful example of how many mindless
things can do smart things together. And how important collaboration is
between the different defense layers of your immune system.</p>
<p>OK. In terms of raw brutal fighting power we have gotten to know the
most important soldiers of your body and learned about some of the core
principles that keep them going and make them work. Let us summarize
briefly what we learned so far about the Innate Immune System before we
move on.</p>
<p>Your body is wrapped in an ingenious self-repairing border wall that
is incredibly hard to pass and that protects you extremely efficiently.
If it is breached, your Innate Immune System reacts immediately. First
your black rhinos, Macrophages, huge cells that swallow enemies whole,
appear and dish out death. If they sense too many enemies they use
cytokines, information proteins to call your chimp-with-machine-gun
Neutrophils, the crazy suicide warriors of the immune system.
Neutrophils don’t live long and their fighting is harmful to the body
because they kill civilian cells. Both of these cells cause
inflammation, bringing in fluid and reinforcements to an infection,
making a battlefield swell up. One of the reinforcements is complement
proteins, an army of millions of tiny proteins that passively support
the immune cells in their fight and help mark, attach to, maim, and
clear enemies. These powerful teams together are enough for most small
wounds and infections you encounter.</p>
<p>But what if all of this is not enough? After all, we just assumed all
of this would work out. The sad reality is that often enough, it
doesn’t. Bacteria are not just pushovers but have developed a number of
strategies to hide or avoid the first line of defense. Tiny wounds can
be a death sentence if an infection is not contained and eliminated.</p>
<p>So let us escalate the situation.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 Complement activating randomly, by pure lucky chance, is actually
one of the ways it can happen. There are other, more complicated ways
complement can activate, but have a look at the fancy diagrams for
that!</p>
<p>Also, does this random activation happen even when there are no
enemies around? Indeed it does! Your cells have defenses against your
own complement system to prevent random complement proteins from
accidently attacking them!</p>
<p>13 Cell Intelligence: The Dendritic Cell</p>
<p>In the wound caused by the rusty nail, things have started to get out
of hand. Despite fighting bravely for hours and killing hundreds of
thousands of enemies, the Macrophages and Neutrophils could not
eliminate the infection. Out of all the different bacteria that invaded
the wound, all were maimed, butchered, and eaten, except one species.
That one species was not particularly impressed by the defenses and
resisted.*</p>
<p>These pathogenic soil bacteria in your infected wound employed
defenses, multiplied quickly, and gained a real foothold. They nourish
themselves with the resources that were meant for civilian cells and
begin defecating everywhere, releasing chemicals that hurt or kill
cells, civilians, and defenders. The complement proteins that came with
the first waves of fluids from the blood have been largely used up and
more and more of the immune cells that fought for hours and days are
giving up and dying of exhaustion.</p>
<p>And while fresh Neutrophils still arrive, their reckless fighting
becomes more and more of a burden. They order more inflammation,
refreshing the complement resistance but also making more and more
tissue swell up. The collateral damage is increasing quickly and, at
this point, more civilian cells die through the efforts of your immune
system than through the actions of the bacteria. On all sides the death
count rises rapidly and there is no end in sight.</p>
<p>And now, on the scale of the human, you really begin to notice. You
finished the hike minorly annoyed, came home, took a shower, and put a
Band-Aid on your wound. But the next day, walking is still a tiny bit
unpleasant. Your toe has swollen considerably, it is red, and you feel
it throbbing. Even without putting pressure on it, your toe hurts. As
you examine it, squeezing it, the crusted wound bursts open and a drop
of yellowish pus oozes out.</p>
<p>This strange-smelling substance can emerge from wounds a day or two
after they have been infected. Pus is the dead bodies of millions of
Neutrophils that fought to the death for you, mixed in with ripped-apart
remains of civilian cells, dead enemies, and spent antimicrobial
substances. A little bit disgusting, sure, but also a testament to the
selfless effort of your immune cells engaged in a fight for your life
that has to end in their death. Without your Neutrophils’ sacrifice,
this infection would have spread already. Maybe to the bloodstream,
which would give the intruders access to the whole body and that would
be really, really bad.</p>
<p>But there is still hope. While the battle has been raging, the
intelligence portion of your innate immune system has been quietly doing
its job in the background: The Dendritic Cell is on its way.</p>
<p>For a long time, Dendritic Cells were not really taken seriously,
which makes sense if you look at them: they are just ridiculous. Large
cells with long starfish-like arms flopping around everywhere, drinking
and vomiting constantly. But it turns out they have two of the most
crucial jobs of your entire immune system: They identify what kind of
enemy is infecting you, if it is a bacterium or a virus or a parasite.
And they make the decision to activate the next stage of your defense:
Your adaptive immune cells, your heavy, specialized weapons that need to
come in if your innate immune system is in danger of being
overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Dendritic Cells are very careful and relaxed sentinel cells. They sit
around just about everywhere in your body below your skin and mucosa and
they are present in all of your immune bases, your lymph nodes. Their
job is simply to get drunk. The Dendritic Cell is like a careful
connoisseur of the fluids of your body that flows around between your
cells. In a way, it treats them like expensive wine at an exclusive wine
tasting event. It takes a sip, moves it around in its imaginary mouth to
get the full picture of all its different tastes and components, and
then spits it out again. On an average day, it swallows and spits out
multiple times its own volume.</p>
<p>The Dendritic Cell is always looking for a few very particular
tastes—the flavor of bacteria or viruses, the taste of dying civilian
cells, or the taste of alarm cytokines from fighting immune cells. When
it takes a sip and recognizes any of these flavors, it knows that danger
is present and goes into a more active sampling mode. Now the Dendritic
Cell stops spitting and begins swallowing. It only has a limited amount
of time to sample and it is determined to use every second of it.
Similar to Macrophages, it begins phagocytosis, grabbing and swallowing
whatever garbage or enemies that are floating around the battlefield.
But with one major difference—the Dendritic Cell is not trying to digest
any enemies. It is still breaking them down into pieces but it is doing
so to collect samples and to identify them. Not only is the Dendritic
Cell able to distinguish if an enemy is, for example, a bacterium, it
can distinguish between different species of bacteria and knows what
sort of defense is needed against them.</p>
<p>In your infected toe, for a few hours, this is what the Dendritic
Cell did: it floated around a bit, and swallowed as many samples as it
was able to grab with its long, weird tentacle arms. It collected and
analyzed and stored all sorts of chemicals and enemy corpses it could
get. After a few hours its internal timer runs out. Suddenly the
Dendritic Cell stops sampling. It has all the information it needs, and
since it smells that the battle is very much still active and dire, it
begins moving. The Dendritic Cell takes off and leaves the
battlefield—its destination is the great gathering place, the
intelligence center where millions of potential partners await.</p>
<p>Once a Dendritic Cell is on its way, it has become something like a
snapshot of the state of the battlefield, at a particular point in time.
A living information carrier of what was going on at the site of
infection when they took their samples. We will learn more about this
later, but, in a nutshell, the Dendritic Cell delivers context to the
Adaptive Immune System. If it continued to sample while it was in
transit, this could cause two issues: the samples it had collected on
the battlefield would be diluted by samples from the journey, and the
level of danger would not be as obvious from the snapshot. And secondly,
if the cell sampled outside the battlefield, it could pick up harmless
material from your body and accidentally cause an autoimmune disease.
You don’t need to understand how and why at this point, we will discuss
these horrible and fascinating diseases later on.</p>
<p>In any way, the battlefield snapshot, the living information carrier,
needs to be delivered to a lymph node. To get there, the Dendritic Cell
has to enter the Immune System Superhighway: The Lymphatic System, which
is a great opportunity to get to know your internal plumbing!</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, you know what might be fun, how about an example of how
bacteria resist your immune defenses. Many pathogenic bacteria don’t
care that much about the complement system, for example. While
complement might be super deadly for most bacteria, real pathogens laugh
off these silly little proteins and just do their thing in your body,
carefully avoiding them. A very fascinating example is the bacterium
Klebsiella pneumoniae, a pathogen that causes, among other horrible
things, pneumonia. It avoids the whole complement affair by hiding
itself from complement proteins behind a sticky and gooey structure
called a capsule. Which is quite literally a slimy sugary coat the
bacteria produce to cover the molecules the immune system would
recognize. Simple and effective, like a deodorant for bacteria.</li>
