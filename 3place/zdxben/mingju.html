<li><p>Although funnily enough, it may actually have been a side effect
of single-celled organisms being mean to each other. As at one point one
cell swallowed another but did not devour it. Instead these two cells
started arguably the most successful partnership on planet Earth that is
still going strong today. The “inside cell” (that we know as
“mitochondria” today) specialized in making energy available for the
host, while the “outside cell” offered protection and delivered free
food. This deal worked very well and enabled the new super cell to grow
in complexity and become more and more sophisticated.</p></li>

<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>And this is only half of the story because your body hosts
bacteria that you need to survive. How many? One bacterium for each of
the forty trillion cells in your body (which happens to be a pretty good
ballpark in terms of size; if you were the size of an average body cell,
a bacterium would be roughly the size of a bunny). Let us imagine them
as baby bunnies to make the thought less horrifying. Most of these cute
bunnies live in your gut. In this ginormous cave, 36 trillion bunnies
live their lives, constantly dying and reproducing, breaking down chunks
of food the size of skyscrapers so it can be distributed to all the
people making up the continent of flesh. The other four trillion bunnies
are crawling on your skin, are inside your lungs, hopping over your
teeth and your tongue, they swim in the fluid of your eyes, crawl in and
out of your ears. We’ll talk more about them later but for now just
imagine yourself as being covered by cute bunnies who are your friends
and have only your best interests in mind.</p></li>

<li><p>1 If you are reading this outside, well, that is unfortunate for
the metaphor, isn’t it? So please pretend you are somewhere
inside.</p></li>
<li><p>2 You may ask yourself why that is. Well, we could spend a lot of
time talking about this and it is actually quite fascinating but also
opening a whole new can of worms. So let us just say that it matters how
big you are. While for you on the human scale water is this uniform
substance, if you were the size of a protein, a single water molecule is
pretty big, like an actual thing that bumps into you. So you would find
it much harder to swim through water too.</p></li>
<li><p>3 Some of you will do the math now and get even crazier numbers.
Forty trillion cells times two meters is roughly 80,000,000,000,000
meters, which is actually five times the distance to Pluto and back to
Earth. But there is a minor catch we didn’t mention in the intro about
the body: The vast majority of your cells actually do not have DNA. Red
blood cells in particular make up around 80% of your cells by pure
numbers, and they don’t have a nucleus, because they are filled head to
toe with iron molecules that transport oxygen. So you will have to
settle for going to Pluto and coming back just once.</p></li>
<li><p>4 This is not to say that our complex human cells are completely
reliant on randomness. Cells have a lot of complex and wonderful
mechanisms to get things exactly where they need them to be, and that
we’ll ignore here. If you do care: There are transport proteins that
move along the scaffolding of cells. The best thing about them is that
they look like gigantic, ridiculous feet that jump forward by magic and
if you have a moment to get distracted, you should look at videos of
them on YouTube.</p></li>
<li><p>5 In reality it is more like throwing thousands of toasts and
thousands of pots of jelly into the air. Your cells have no use for a
single jelly sandwich but need large amounts of everything to make
things work out.</p></li>

<li><p>So you have probably heard that you have white blood cells and
they are your immune cells or something like that. Well, while this name
has its use in the right context it just generally means “the cells of
the immune system” and I don’t think immunology has done itself a favor
with this term. “White blood cells” describes so many different cells
that do so many different things that it is sort of useless if you want
to understand what is really going on here. So you can forget “white
blood cells” again because we are not going to use it.</p></li>

<ol start="34" type="1">
<li><p>Let us give this throwaway line a bit more weight and remind all
of us that our grandparents in fact did have it harder in life. We have
data from a Boston hospital from 1941 that shows that 82% of bacterial
infections of the blood resulted in death. We can barely imagine the
horror this number represents—a scratch and a tiny bit of dirt literally
could mean that your life was about to end. Today in developed countries
less than 1% of these kinds of infections are deadly. The fact that we
don’t really think about this stuff too much shows how fast humans
forget and move on, and how happy we can be to live in the present and
not in the past.</p></li>

<li><p>3,</p></li>
<li><p>1 Defensins are a really interesting beast. There are several
subclasses and they are mostly produced by the border cells of your body
and certain immune cells in battle. So what do they do? Well, they rip
tiny holes into things. Think of them as tiny needles specific to
certain intruders, like bacteria or fungi. So if these needles happen to
encounter a microorganism they inject themselves into it and create a
pore. A small wound, where the victim sort of bleeds a little bit. One
needle will not kill a bacteria, but a few dozen might. Because the
defensins are so specific, they are completely harmless for body cells
but can kill microorganisms completely by themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>2 We’ll talk about viruses in a lot more detail in part 3 of the
book, but since we are already here, we should mention that the way the
skin is built, it is practically immune against viruses. Because these
little parasites can infect only living cells and the surface of your
skin consists only of dead cells, there is nothing to infect here! Only
very few viruses have evolved ways to infect your skin, so bacteria and
fungi are of much greater concern to your skin.</p></li>
<li><p>3 pH—Acids and Bases: pH is one of those things that is often not
properly explained or quickly forgotten once it is. For once, scientists
gave something a great name: pH is short for POWER OF HYDROGEN, which is
exciting and easy to remember. But then scientists decided to abbreviate
it. Disappointing to say the least. Without getting too deep into it,
the POWER OF HYDROGEN is a scale that describes how many hydrogen ions
are present in a water-based solution.</p></li>
<li><p>4 Wait, a footnote inside a footnote? Is this even allowed? Just
to expand on the concept of “power.” Power in this context doesn’t mean
that the hydrogen is extra strong or anything like that. We are dipping
into the wonderful universe of math here. This is “math power,”
correctly called exponential. So going up 1 POWER on the pH scale means
having ten times fewer hydrogen ions. Going up 6 POWER on the pH scale
means having one million times fewer hydrogen ions. (Why is going up the
scale meaning fewer ions? Because the scale is inverted—why make
something easy when it can be complicated?)</p></li>

<h4 id="the-cut">7 The Cut</h4>
<ol start="52" type="1">
<li><p>OK get ready for a wild story! Platelets are not actually cells
but cell fragments from another cell called megakaryocyte. Enormously
large fellows, that are around six times larger than your average cell
and live in your bone marrow. They have very long octopus-like arms,
that they push into your blood vessels and begin to grow them. When one
of these weird arms has grown enough, small packages break off.
Functional mini parts of cells that are carried away by the blood. These
packages are your platelets and every time you cut yourself or suffer a
wound, they close it. A single megakaryocyte produces around 10,000 of
these platelets in its lifetime from its flabby long arms that stretch
from your bones to into your blood. Your body is seriously so weird and
so amazing.</p></li>

<li><p>3</p></li>
<li><p>4</p></li>
<li><p>1 Have you ever asked yourself why your body would be OK with
having huge amounts of ink below its skin? Because in general, your
immune system is not OK with anything that is not itself, or did not get
a special permit, hanging around in the body. But somehow, you can push
ink with a fast-moving needle into the second layer of your skin and it
remains there for many years. While the body is not excited about having
ink under its skin, if the person scratching tasteful art into your
flesh is doing their job correctly, it is also not particularly harmful.
Still, your local immune system is not pleased by the intrusion. And so
your skin swells and some of the ink particles are carried away. The
majority stays in the tissue though—not because Macrophages do not try
to gobble them up. Most of the metallic ink particles are just too large
to be swallowed, and so they remain where they are. The ones that are
small enough to be eaten, though, are eaten.</p></li>
<li><p>2 In actuality, you produce around one billion Neutrophils per
two pounds (a kilogram) of body weight; you can do the math for what
this means for you.</p></li>
<li><p>3 Neutrophils are indeed so careless when it comes to causing
collateral damage that there are cases where Macrophages are trying to
hide damaged cells from them! Every day for a variety of reasons, a few
cells die in your organs in unnatural ways, maybe because you looked at
your phone and ran into a street sign for example. But often enough the
damage is pretty mild and does not require a strong reaction from your
immune system. We will learn more about it later, but dead cells attract
Neutrophils and if they find a single dead cell, they will escalate the
situation and cause even more damage that is not necessary. So to stop
them from that, Macrophages can sort of cover a single dead cell with
their body to literally hide it from Neutrophils, so they are confused
and leave again.</p></li>
<li><p>4 Another neat little detail about Neutrophils is that when they
are chasing a pathogen, they often do so in swarms that follow the same
mathematical rules as swarms of insects. So imagine being hunted by a
bunch of hornets the size of cows and you get the same stressful
experience that many bacteria must go through in the last few moments of
their lives.</p></li>
<li><p>1</p></li>
<li><p>2</p></li>
<li><p>3</p></li>
<li><p>1 The way inflammation helps immune cells to get to the
battlefield is very weird and fascinating. What basically happens is
that the chemical signals from inflammation trigger a change in your
blood vessels close to where the inflammation signals are coming from,
and in your immune cells that get activated by these signals. Both
parties extend many little special adhesion molecules that work a bit
like Velcro. The immune cells that are speeding through the blood now
can stick to the cells making up the blood vessels, and slow down close
to the site of infection. On top of that, inflammation makes your blood
vessels more porous, which makes it easier for your immune cells to
squeeze through tiny spaces and move towards the battlefield.</p></li>
<li><p>2 Everything related to the immune system has an exception. There
are a few areas in your body that are excluded from this rule, like your
brain, spinal cord, part of your eyes, and testicles (if you happen to
have testicles, that is). All are extremely sensitive regions where
inflammation could cause immediate, irreparable damage and so these
areas are so-called immune privileged, which means that cells of the
immune system are kept out of there by the blood-tissue barriers—and
those that are allowed in are on super special orders to
behave.</p></li>
<li><p>3 You probably learned in school that mitochondria, the
powerhouse of the cell, were ancient bacteria that merged with the
ancestors of your cells to become a symbiotic organism. Today they are
organelles inside your cells that provide the cell with useful energy.
Your immune system still remembers them as bacteria though, as intruders
that have no business being outside cells. So if your cells burst and
your immune system detects mitochondria floating around, your immune
cells will react super alarmed.</p></li>
<li><p>1</p></li>
<li><p>2</p></li>
<li><p>1 Yes, there are single-celled organisms that have
photoreceptors, enabling them to note the difference between dark and
not dark and the direction where light is coming from. But this is not
what we are talking about here.</p></li>
<li><p>2 OK, technically we could be more precise here. There are two
general classes of cytokines relevant at this point: The cytokines that
convey information and chemokines. Chemokines are a family of small
cytokines secreted by cells. Their name means “move chemical” and is
very fitting as their main ability is to motivate cells to move in a
certain direction. They are not just floating around, certain civilian
cells also can pick them up and sort of “decorate” themselves with them,
to function as a sort of guide system for immune cells. So in a
nutshell, chemokines are cytokines that are guiding or attracting immune
cells to a place. When immunologists talk about “cytokines,” they
usually mean cytokines that confer information like what is going on in
an infection, which type of pathogen has invaded, and which cell is
needed to fight it. OK wait, this is getting confusing. Chemokines are
cytokines but also cytokines do different things than chemokines? Well,
welcome to the world of immunology, where words exist to make your life
harder. Here is how we are going to solve this in this book: We will
just use the word cytokines because to understand the general principles
you need to understand one thing: Cytokines are a diverse group of
information proteins that make your immune cells do a lot of different
things. One of them is to make them move.</p></li>

<li><p>OK no, this is actually not true! Sperm cells do use a long and
powerful flagellum to move forward (which are technically different
structures that work differently but are called the same because hey,
biology is not confusing enough apparently). But sperm is a fascinating
example in any case. Think about it, why does the body of a woman not
recognize sperm cells as other and kill them right away? Well, it does!
This is one of the reasons you need about 200 million sperm cells to
fertilize a single egg! Right after sperm is delivered into the vagina,
it is confronted with a hostile environment that it has to deal with.
The vagina is a pretty acidic and deadly place for visitors, so sperm
cells move on as fast as possible to escape it. Most of them gain access
to the cervix and uterus within a few minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>1 Complement activating randomly, by pure lucky chance, is
actually one of the ways it can happen. There are other, more
complicated ways complement can activate, but have a look at the fancy
diagrams for that!</p></li>
<li><p>Hey, you know what might be fun, how about an example of how
bacteria resist your immune defenses. Many pathogenic bacteria don’t
care that much about the complement system, for example. While
complement might be super deadly for most bacteria, real pathogens laugh
off these silly little proteins and just do their thing in your body,
carefully avoiding them. A very fascinating example is the bacterium
Klebsiella pneumoniae, a pathogen that causes, among other horrible
things, pneumonia. It avoids the whole complement affair by hiding
itself from complement proteins behind a sticky and gooey structure
called a capsule. Which is quite literally a slimy sugary coat the
bacteria produce to cover the molecules the immune system would
recognize. Simple and effective, like a deodorant for bacteria.</p></li>

<li><p>1 What do we mean when we say that an Antibody “neutralizes” a
virus? Well, imagine your cells are a subway train and the virus a
passenger that wanted to get inside. This is usually fairly easy for the
virus, just pass one of the automated ticket barriers and enter through
one of the doors. An Antibody is basically grabbing and covering up the
ticket of the virus so it can’t pass the ticket barrier and is stuck
outside. The more Antibodies attach to the ticket, the more impossible
it becomes to get to the train. And so it is neutralized, unable to do
anything of consequence. A passenger stranded at the station.</p></li>
<li><p>2 OK, OK, there are five antibody classes in humans but we are
going to ignore the poor IgD Antibody because it is not relevant for
anything we are talking about in this book. In a nutshell, IgD can help
with activating a bunch of immune cells and whatnot. But I think we had
enough details already and this is not that important. But there you
have it, a footnote to a headline!</p></li>
<li><p>3 We mentioned before that your spleen is a sort of lymph node
for your blood but there is more! This tiny organ is the main source for
superfast responding IgM Antibodies in your blood. A sort of emergency
base that can react fast if pathogens like bacteria make it into your
blood flow, via an injury for example. The spleen filters your blood and
when it finds enemies here it can quickly activate B Cells that rapidly
make IgM Antibodies. Sure, they are not optimized like the other
Antibody classes, but they are available extremely quickly, which is
important when you have invaders in your blood—that gives a pathogen
access to the whole body! This is one of the things that makes your
spleen so important. This mechanism was discovered after wars, where due
to severe injuries to the torso, people often had their spleens removed.
It turned out that many of them died of sepsis later in life, at much
higher rates than the rest of the population. Nowadays, if your spleen
is damaged, say in a car crash, doctors try to save as much of it as
possible.</p></li>

viruses. So many, actually, that up to 40% of all bacteria in the oceans
are killed by virus infections every single day. And even more, even
your most intimate self is not safe from viruses: About 8% of your DNA
is made of remnants of viral DNA. We’ll stop with the large numbers now
because nobody can picture this stuff anyway. Let us just agree that
there are a whole lot of viruses on earth and they seem to be doing

<li><p>1 The name influenza means “influence” in Italian and stems from
a time in the Middle Ages when people thought that the influence of
astronomical events could affect your health and cause diseases. For
example, liquid flowing off the stars and into Earth and then humans
somehow. Almost as crazy as the idea that the positions of stars when
you were born have an influence on your character and personality
traits.</p></li>
<li><p>2 The Spanish flu was special because it turned the tables a
little bit—usually the flu kills mostly small kids and older adults but
in this case the opposite happened. If you were a healthy adult in your
prime you had the highest chance of dying from the Spanish flu. The
disease was the hardest on the healthiest people because it made their
immune systems flip out and lose all constraint, leading to an overall
mortality rate of roughly 10%.</p></li>
<li><p>3 With viruses we have now truly entered the intimate and
mind-bending world of biochemistry. Cells are made from millions of
parts moved by thousands of processes going on at the same time, in a
complex and wonderful dance that we call life. Viruses interfere here in
ways that are stunningly complex and complicated. If we were to go into
detail, we would encounter viral proteins and molecules with horrible
names like vRNPs, viral polymerase complexes like PB1, PB2, or PA, viral
membrane proteins HA, NA, or M2, polypeptides like HA1 and HA2. This
stuff is fascinating but it also requires a multiple-page-long discourse
about the detailed inner workings of your cells and how viral parts
interact and manipulate them. It is just a layer of complexity that is
not necessary to get the principles at play here. You really need to
remember only one thing: The virus is basically performing a hostile
takeover of the machinery of your cell.</p></li>
<li><p>4 So as we are talking about millions of infected body cells,
what does it mean to you in a practical sense? How much of your lung is
infected at this point? How big is a patch of a million infected
epithelial cells? Very roughly, a million infected epithelial cells have
a surface area of half an inch (1.2 centimeters). This is roughly less
than half of the surface area of a Lincoln penny or a Euro cent. In
total your lungs have a surface area of about 84 square yards (70 square
meters), which is just short of a badminton court. So actually only a
tiny amount of your lungs has been infected at this point. It becomes
scary again if you remember how tiny a cell is and how quickly this
scaled up from basically nothing. If the virus was allowed to grow at
this rate your whole lung would be infected in no time and you would be
very dead.</p></li>
<li><p>5 OK, OK, that is slightly unfair. Not all bacteria are like
clumsy idiots, many pathogenic ones have arguably genius strategies for
hiding and striking hard when the time is right. A very cool example is
quorum sensing. In a nutshell, this means that pathogenic bacteria
invade a tissue but are very discreet. Like they control themselves and
the metabolism strictly while they divide, downregulating all sorts of
metabolic products (bacteria poop) and hiding their dangerous weapons
that could reveal them to the immune system. They do that by waiting for
a chemical signal that tells them to attack at the right moment. When a
critical mass is reached they suddenly and all at once stop their
secretive behavior. Now they are no longer a small threat that could be
taken care of easily but a formidable army, and they lose the constraint
all at once. If they behaved like that from the get-go they would have
been attacked and probably killed right away. So yeah, quorum sensing is
pretty cool and bacteria have more than one strategy.</p></li>

<li><p>1 Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells have one of these horrible names
in immunology that are not helpful at all. A thing about the immune
system is that there are a lot of different subclasses of cells. So
there are a bunch of different Dendritic Cells, a bunch of different
macrophages, etc. The thing is: This doesn’t really matter. It would be
much better if the Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell would be called:
“Chemical Warfare Cell.” Or “Antivirus Alarm Cell.” Or anything other
than what it is actually called, because all of these names would
describe it better. We will handle this by never mentioning this cell
again after we explain it here because on the one hand, it is too cool
not to mention that you have this special antiviral chemical warfare
cell but on the other, it is confusing that there are special “Dendritic
Cells” with completely different jobs than the regular Dendritic Cells
we got to learn so much about. So once we are done talking about it
here, we can all just die happily without learning any more details
about it.</p></li>
<li><p>2 Why do you lose your appetite when you are sick? Well, you can
blame the onslaught of cytokines that your immune system releases for
that. The cytokines signal your brain that a serious defense is
happening at that very moment that the body needs to conserve energy
for. Because as you may imagine, mobilizing millions or billions of
cells for a fight is a pretty resource-heavy operation. Digesting food
actually requires a lot of energy too, so shutting these processes down
is freeing up your system to focus on the defense. It also reduces the
availability of certain nutrients in your blood that your invaders would
love to get their tiny pathogenic hands on. This does not mean that you
should actively try to starve out a disease. Not digesting is a
short-term strategy not a long term solution and in chronically ill
people, the lack of appetite can lead to dangerous weight loss. So if
you feel hungry again you can eat something to refill your energy
storage.</p></li>
<li><p>3 A lot of different substances can be pyrogens, from certain
interferons, to special molecules released by activated macrophages to
the cell walls of bacteria. But in the end, you just need to remember
one thing: Your innate immune cells release substances called pyrogens
that order your brain to make your body hotter!</p></li>
<li><p>4 OK, let us talk about one of the weirdest Nobel Prizes for
medicine and how upsetting the past was and how great the present is.
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by spirochetes
bacteria. Its possible symptoms are horrible and creepy and if you want
to have a bad time you should go look up some pictures online. One of
the possible late stages of the disease is neurosyphilis, an infection
of the central nervous system. Patients affected by it basically would
usually suffer from meningitis and progressive brain damage. What made
the experience even more unpleasant were mental problems, from dementia
to schizophrenia, depression, mania, or delirium, all caused by the
bacteria wreaking havoc. Ultimately it is fair to say that affected
patients had a bad time and in the end they would die without doctors
being able to help them, other than to try to alleviate their suffering.
But they did observe that in some cases patients that suffered from
unrelated, very high fevers would actually end up being healed. So
naturally, a few doctors began experimenting with pyrotherapy, a version
of treatment by causing fever, and began injecting syphilis patients
with malaria. This sounds horrible at first but it was a pretty
acceptable risk—the patients would die anyway and malaria could already
be treated at the time. Malaria was a prime candidate because it caused
high fevers over a long and sustained time and basically cooked out the
syphilis bacteria that just could not stand the heat. Indeed the
treatment was so effective that it was honored with the Nobel Prize in
Medicine in 1927. The onset of antibiotics made the treatment obsolete
in the 1940s, making this story one of the great footnotes in medical
history.</p></li>
<li><p>5 This seems to be true for most animals. For example, lizards
that were held in terrariums with higher temperatures had a higher
chance of surviving an infection than lizards that were held in colder
environments. And there have been a number of similar experiments with
fish, mice, or rabbits and even some plant species. Transforming our
bodies into a hot ecosystem just seems to be a good defense strategy
against the intruders of the microworld. Interestingly, animals who
can’t regulate their body temperature like us mammals can, so-called
“ectothermic,” or “cold-blooded,” animals like lizards or turtles have
behavioral fever. Which means that if their immune cells release certain
cytokines, they look for a hot place, like a rock that has been in the
hot sun for a long time, and rest there for a while. They basically
grill themselves to increase their body temperature to a point where the
pathogens inside them have a really bad time.</p></li>
<li><p>6 You know the people who use moments like this to sharply inhale
before they let you know they never get sick even though you didn’t ask
them? Or that they haven’t been sick in years because _ (enter reason
that makes no sense) _ ? Rest assured: Everybody gets sick, common cold
infections can just be pretty mild or we selectively remember the times
when we feel fine. The best way to react to this kind of outburst is to
nod politely and change the subject.</p></li>

<li><p>1 What is an abnormal protein, you ask? For example certain
proteins are made only when you are an embryo inside your mother’s womb.
Some of these proteins make it possible for embryonic cells to grow and
divide rapidly, something you need at this early stage of life but is
detrimental to you as an adult. The building instructions for these
proteins are still part of the DNA in adult cells—although they are not
used anymore. There is a whole library of proteins like these and their
presence, in anything but embryos, tells the immune system that
something is off. So these proteins are not technically faulty because
they are serving your tumor well, but they are definitely abnormal and
thus a sign of danger for your body.</p></li>

is a pathogen that infects cells, even I am infected, mobilize special

<li><p>1 While this may sound easy and straightforward, it wasn’t. It
still took a worldwide vaccination program and over 200 years to finally
bring smallpox to its knees. To this day, smallpox remains the first and
sadly only human pathogen that humanity has wiped out completely.
Smallpox no longer occurs in the wild and only remains (hopefully)
safely stored in two labs, one in the United States and one in
Russia.</p></li>
<li><p>2 The chances of your dying through a snakebite in Australia are
actually pretty low. Only around 3,000 people are bitten by snakes each
year, and on average two of these die. Still, the amount of venomous
critters on this continent is way too high and no amount of real-world
statistics will convince me otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>3 Are you ready for something really cool that is also really
bad? With everything that we have learned about proteins and antigens
and all that, how is it possible that your immune system is cool with
getting antibodies from an entirely different species? Well fun fact, it
is not cool with that but actually really indignant about the sudden
flood of horse or bunny protein. So while the antivenom will work fine
the first time, the second time you might be immune to it because your
body might make antibodies against the antibodies from a horse or bunny.
This is one of the cases where the immune system just could not have
expected that modern medicine would come up with creative solutions like
pumping venom into a horse and then using its blood for ourselves. Which
is fair so we can’t really be annoyed too much with our immune system in
that case.</p></li>
<li><p>A natural question at this point is how HIV treatments work.
Well, without going into too much detail, the mechanisms are more or
less that the different stages of virus development are targeted and
blocked or slowed down, so the HIV infection can never turn into AIDS.
The more interesting question, though, is why don’t we have working
medicine against the flu but we do have a few different treatments
against HIV? (Well OK, we actually do have a very safe and effective
vaccine against the flu, which is redeveloped each year to account for
the rapid mutation of the flu virus. It is just that for some reason not
that many people get flu shots.) OK. The answer is a bit depressing:
Attention and money. It is easy to forget that HIV used to be a new
pandemic once and a very shocking and scary one. In 2019 there were
still around thirty-eight million infected people around the world. When
HIV and AIDS emerged it caused panic in the establishment, leading to an
outpouring of resources and attention that was unprecedented. Humanity
really wanted to get results, fast (as a happy byproduct, immunologists
learned a lot of new things about the immune system). And we got them,
and turned HIV from deadly to a chronic disease and may even slay it for
good one day. Similar things could be observed with the vaccines for
COVID-19, which broke even the best speed record. In the end it really
seems to be a question of what is a cure worth to us and how desperately
do we want it. Another testament to the fact that humans really could
solve all of their major problems if they were better at
prioritizing.</p></li>

the most common food allergy that adults can suddenly gain but there are
a lot of different things that you can become suddenly allergic to, from
milk to nuts, soy, sesame, eggs, or wheat. Allergies suck.</p></li>
<li><p>2 Urgh. OK, time for a big BUT. So what we are describing here is
the “standard” case of how allergies work. You encounter an allergen for
the first time, your immune system charges up, you encounter it a second
time, and boom, allergic reaction. But what about stories like our
introduction, with the poor person suddenly no longer able to enjoy
their favorite ocean spider dish? Well, here is a fun fact: We don’t
exactly understand this yet. Adult-onset allergies are a bit of a
mystery, which is a bit frightening considering how many people
encounter them in their lives. I myself had the joy of being rushed to a
hospital with a new surprise allergy to something I had eaten for years,
so I’d very much like to know how this works. But yeah, you now have to
live with the information that people can just suddenly become allergic
to things they ate all their lives with no warning.</p></li>

<li><p>1 Unfortunately, as parasitic worm infestations correlate with
poverty and low infrastructure development, there is another bonus
problem on top. If you suffer from malnutrition, a parasitic worm is a
much larger problem for you than if you are well fed. Which makes sense
because on a fundamental level, the worm is inside you because it wants
to steal your nutrients. If you have a hard time getting enough calories
for yourself, having subtenants in your body that don’t pay rent can
seriously weaken your whole system. So the people who are the least
fortunate suffer the most from these parasites.</p></li>

Hypothesis and Old Friends</h4>

<li><p>What is generally troubling about these appeals to naturalism is
the idea itself, that something natural is somehow better. Nature does
not care about you or any individual at all. Your brain and body and
immune system are built on the bones of billions of your would-be
ancestors who were not fast enough to escape a lion, were killed by a
mild infection, or were just a little worse at pulling the nutrients
from their food. Nature gave us charming diseases like smallpox, cancer,
rabies, and parasitic worms that feast on the eyes of your children.
Nature is cruel and without any form of care for you. Our ancestors
fought tooth and nail to build a different world for themselves, a world
without all this suffering and pain and horror. And consequently we
should celebrate and marvel at the enormous progress we’ve made as a
species. While we obviously still have a long way to go and the modern
world has a lot of downsides, the notion that “natural is better” is
something only people who are not actually living in nature can say, and
who have forgotten why our ancestors worked so hard to escape
it.</p></li>

<li><p>Somewhere in this book this needs to be mentioned and we might as
well do it here. Beware headlines about anything health related that
mentions animal models. Yes, it is crucially important to test drugs in
animals, but unsurprisingly, animals and humans are different. Yes, we
have created mice with immune systems that basically mirror our human
immune system, yes, we have monkeys like macaques that live on an
evolutionary branch that is not that far away from ours, but these are
still completely different organisms. There are all kinds of drugs that
heal mice or prolong their lives and do whatnot—but do nothing at all
for humans. Or worse, they are dangerous or even deadly for us. So
again, this is not saying that these experiments are not critically
important, unbelievably important knowledge has been gained through
animal models. But when it comes to drugs and cures, everything can be
different once a drug is used by humans. So if you hear news about some
kind of amazing drug, make sure to check if the excitement is based on
human trials or if it is still in an earlier stage, tested in
animals.</p></li>

<li><p>There is this myth that your attitude is crucial when it comes to
surviving cancer. The general idea is that if you have and display a
positive attitude, you will activate some mystical force in the immune
system and enable it to overcome the disease. Inversely, a really
negative attitude may have the opposite effect and make it harder for
your body to beat the disease or may even have caused it. Wherever the
idea of your attitude affecting your cancer survival chances originally
comes from, after decades of research it has become clear that with an
extremely high certainty, your attitude has no effect on your chances of
surviving cancer. Your immune system does not magically become better or
worse at fighting cancer if you are or are not positive and happy.
Still, this myth is going strong, as it appeals to our culture of
self-empowerment and agency and is spread by many well-meaning
people.</p></li>

<li><p>1 A callback to what we learned before. One of the reasons why
some people are able to deal better with the coronavirus than others is
the genetic variability and the difference in MHC molecules or your
toll-like receptors that lead to slightly different immune systems from
person to person. Some immune systems are just better at dealing with
the virus than others. And some are unfortunately really bad at dealing
with it. So if you hear in the media that seemingly young and healthy
people suffer from severe cases of COVID-19 and even die, this is one
aspect of it. We never know what our individual immune system is great
against until it is put to the test.</p></li>
<li><p>2 One of the many reasons obesity is such an unhealthy thing is
that fat tissue produces loads of inflammatory cytokines. So even on a
good day, an obese person has a lot of inflammatory signals in their
system. When infected by the coronavirus for example, their starting
point is already worse, they are already more inflamed than they should
be.</p></li>
