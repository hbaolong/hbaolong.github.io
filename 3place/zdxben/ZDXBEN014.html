<h4 id="cooking-tasty-receptor-recipes">17 Cooking Tasty Receptor
Recipes</h4>
<p>To understand how your adaptive immune cells are able to recognize
every possible enemy in the universe, let us go back to one of our
earlier chapters: “Smelling the Building Blocks of Life.” Let’s freshen
up our memories a bit because the principles we encountered there are
crucial to understanding the next part.</p>
<p>As we discussed before, all living things on earth are made from the
same basic parts, but mostly proteins. Proteins can have countless
different shapes, which you can imagine as 3D puzzle pieces. To
recognize a bacteria and to grab it, your immune cells need to connect
to the protein puzzle pieces of bacteria.</p>
<p>Your Innate Immune System is able to recognize some of the common
protein puzzle pieces our enemies use with those special receptors we
discussed called Toll-Like Receptors. But this somewhat limits the range
of the Innate Immune System, as it is only able to recognize the
structures that can connect to the Toll-Like Receptors. Nothing more,
nothing less.</p>
<p>While microorganisms can’t totally avoid using some of these common
proteins, they still have a huge set of other available proteins to use
as construction material. In the language of immunology, a protein piece
that is recognized by the immune system is called an antigen. There are
hundreds of millions of possible antigens that your Innate Immune System
doesn’t recognize and through the magic of evolution there will always
be new ones created in the future. Antigen is one of these important
ideas that will be very relevant for the rest of the book, so one last
time so you remember more easily: An antigen is a piece of an enemy that
your immune system can recognize.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of millions of potential antigens, hundreds of
millions of different possible proteins. To solve this problem your
adaptive immune system has an ingenious solution. In your body right
now, there is at least one immune cell that has a receptor that can
recognize one of the many millions of different antigens that can exist
in the universe. Let us repeat that: For every possible antigen that is
possible in the universe, you have the potential to recognize it inside
you right now.</p>
<p>Let that sink in for a moment. It is sort of easy to brush over this
fact without giving it the appropriate amount of wonder. What a weird
tactic and even weirder that it works.</p>
<p>But wait a second. Receptors are made from proteins and as we
discussed earlier, a gene is the code to build one protein. If you have
hundreds of millions of different receptors for every possible protein
shape in the universe, do you have hundreds of hundreds of millions of
genes only for immune cell receptors? Well, no. The human genome only
has about 20,000 to 25,000 genes. Wait. How can you get such an enormous
variety of receptors if our genetic code is so much smaller? And it gets
even better: Most of your 20,000–25,000 protein-encoding genes are doing
other things that are not related to the immune system—like making the
proteins that keep the cell alive. In order to generate the largest
known library in the universe, evolution has given your immune system a
small number of gene fragments, not even whole genes, but fragments. How
is this possible? The answer is a deliberate mix and match of those
fragments to create a stunning diversity. Let us try to understand how
this is possible.</p>
<p>Imagine you were a cook for the most fantastical dinner party in the
universe. There are a few hundred million possible dinner guests. And
these guests are extremely picky and annoying. Each of them requires a
unique and specific recipe for their dinner. If they don’t get it, they
get annoyed and try to kill you. And to make it harder, you don’t know
which guests will visit the dinner party beforehand. So you need to get
creative.</p>
<p>You look through your kitchen and find only eighty-three different
ingredients in total, split into three categories: vegetables, meats,
and carbs. If you are confused right now, ingredients represent gene
segments! But anyway, you decide to start mixing ingredients to make
different recipes.</p>
<p>So for starters, you have fifty different vegetables: Tomatoes,
zucchini, onions, peppers, carrots, eggplant, broccoli, and so on. You
choose one. Then you move on to meat, which is pretty simple because
there are only six options: Beef, pork, chicken, lamb, tuna, or crab.
You get one of those. And last you choose one carb out of twenty-seven
different possibilities: Rice, spaghetti, fries, bread, baked potatoes,
etc. With three different categories and a number of options each, you
get recipes like this for example:</p>
<p>Tomato, Chicken, Rice</p>
<p>Tomato, Chicken, Fries</p>
<p>Tomato, Chicken, Bread</p>
<p>Zucchini, Beef, Spaghetti</p>
<p>Zucchini, Chicken, Spaghetti</p>
<p>Zucchini, Lamb, Penne</p>
<p>Onion, Pork, Baked Potato</p>
<p>Onion, Tuna, Fries</p>
<p>Onion, Pork, Fries</p>
<p>Et cetera</p>
<p>And so on. You get the idea. All in all, from only eighty-three
different ingredients, by combining them in all possible variations, you
get 8,262 unique recipes for your main course! A lot, but not enough to
have a unique one for every potential guest who could show up!</p>
<p>So you decide to add a dessert course. You do the same thing again,
with fewer ingredients this time but the same principle applies:</p>
<p>Chocolate, Cinnamon, Cherries</p>
<p>Caramel, Cinnamon, Cherries</p>
<p>Marshmallow, Nutmeg, Strawberries</p>
<p>Et cetera</p>
<p>And so on until you get another 433 desserts by combining different
sweets and spices! You can randomly combine them with your main courses
to get even more variety. So multiplying 8,262 entrees with 433
desserts, you get 3,577,446 unique dinner combinations for your guests!
Now that you have millions of dishes, you decide to run wild and use
them as the basis for your dinner party. You randomly add or remove
parts of the ingredients. For example, for some recipes you cut away
half an onion while for others you add a tomato. Every single possible
action lets the number of potentially different dishes explode. One of
your final recipes could look like this:</p>
<p>Tomato, chicken, rice, half an onion as entree, marshmallow, pepper,
strawberries, and a quarter banana as a dessert.</p>
<p>After a long day of cooking and randomly combining or subtracting
ingredients, you get at the very least billions of unique meals, which
is enough for those 100 million possible dinner guests. Most of them
taste weird. But the goal was variety for your complicated guests and
not taste.</p>
<p>In principle, this is what your adaptive immune cells do with gene
fragments. It takes gene segments and randomly combines them, then it
does the same again, and then it randomly pulls out or adds in parts, to
create billions of different receptors. They have three different groups
of gene fragments. They randomly choose one from each group and put them
together. This is the main course. Then they do this again, but with
fewer fragments for the dessert. And then when they are done, they
randomly remove or add in parts. This way your adaptive immune cells
create at least hundreds of millions of unique receptors.</p>
<p>Each of them fitting one possible guest at the dinner party, which in
this case is an antigen from a microorganism that could invade your
body. So through controlled recombination, your immune system is
prepared for every possible antigen an enemy could make. But there is a
catch—this ingenious way to create such stunning variety makes your
adaptive immune cells critically dangerous to you. Because what is
stopping them from developing receptors that are able to recognize self,
the parts of your own body? Well, their education is.</p>
<p>So let us finally talk about your most important organ you have never
heard of.</p>
