<h4 id="the-hygiene-hypothesis-and-old-friends">41 The Hygiene
Hypothesis and Old Friends</h4>
<p>The latter half of the twentieth century saw two really weird and
counterintuitive trend lines in developed countries. While dangerous
infectious diseases like smallpox, mumps, measles, and tuberculosis were
successfully pushed back and in some cases got to the verge of
elimination, other diseases and disorders began to grow or even
skyrocketed. The rates of diseases like multiple sclerosis, hay fever,
Crohn’s disease, type 1 diabetes, and asthma have increased by as much
as 300% in the last century. But this is not all: It seems like you can
draw a direct line from how developed and rich a society is to how much
of its population suffers from some kind of allergy or autoimmune
disorder.</p>
<p>The number of new cases of type 1 diabetes is ten times higher in
Finland than it is in Mexico, and 124 times higher than in Pakistan. As
many as one in ten of all preschool children in Western countries suffer
from some form of food allergy while only around two in one hundred in
mainland China do. Ulcerative colitis, a nasty inflammatory bowel
disease, is twice as prevalent in Western Europe as in Eastern Europe.
Around 20% of all U.S. Americans suffer from allergies. All of these
disorders have two common denominators: either the immune system is
overreacting to a seemingly harmless trigger, like pollen from blooming
plants, peanuts, the excrements of dust mites, or air pollution (in a
nutshell: allergies), or it is going a step further and is straight up
attacking and killing civilian body cells, which we experience as
autoimmune disorders like type 1 diabetes. All while humans are dying
less from infections.</p>
<p>In the late eighties, a scientist found that the rate of certain
allergies was connected to the number of siblings a child had. So he
asked the question if “unhygienic contact” between siblings would lead
to higher rates of infections during childhood and if that could have a
protective effect against allergies. And thus the Hygiene Hypothesis was
born and almost right away it was a victim of its own appeal. The
message was too straightforward, too perfect, it fit too nicely into the
zeitgeist.</p>
<p>The perceived message was clear: In our fervor to rid ourselves from
the causes of disease, humans had become too clean and sterile and had
committed a sin against nature, and now we were suffering immune
disorders because of it! It seemed logical that the human immune system
actually needed harmful infections to function properly. The solution
seemed to be equally easy and straightforward! Just be less clean, stop
washing your hands, maybe eat a little spoiled food, pick your nose. In
short: expose yourself and your children to microorganisms and maybe
even contract more infectious diseases to train your immune system!</p>
<p>But as so often with the immune system, the reality seems to be way
more complicated and nuanced. Today many scientists are quite upset how
the Hygiene Hypothesis has permeated popular culture and thinking.
Because it leads to “gut feeling” conclusions by laypeople that are, at
the very least, extremely questionable if not straight-out wrong. For
example, a widely held view is that it is good for us to contract
diseases because surviving them makes us stronger, since this has been
the natural way humans operated in the past.*</p>
<p>Maybe we need hostile bacteria as sparring partners to grow up
strong, and maybe this mechanism of immune training has been destroyed
by the modern world with all its fancy medicine and technology
stuff.</p>
<p>Discussing this topic is a tiny bit sensitive because the scientific
community has not yet reached consensus and there is still a lot that we
don’t know or understand about the microbiota around us, our personal
microbiome, and the interplay with our immune system. One of the things
the “gut” conclusions about hygiene and its supposed dangers does not
account for is the coevolution of our immune system and all the bugs
around us. When the immune systems of our ancestors hundreds of
thousands of years ago adapted to their environment, things were very
different from today.</p>
<p>Of course, our hunting and gathering ancestors did get sick. It is
impossible to get exact numbers but some scientists estimate that up to
one in five people died of infections from pathogens.</p>
<p>But diseases were not the same as they are today. For one, animal
parasites were a much bigger deal than nowadays. Head and body lice,
ticks, and especially worms were prevalent. Infestations by worms are
not a thing most people in developed countries have the decency to be
worried about today, while in our past they might have been so common
and unavoidable that our immune system had to begrudgingly find a mode
of coexistence. But we discussed this already in the last chapter so
rest assured, we are done with parasites! Our immune system did not just
have to deal with worms though, it also had to arrange with some species
of viruses like hepatitis A or bacteria like Helicobacter pylori that it
just could not eradicate and had to live with.</p>
<p>On top of that, most kinds of diseases we associate with being sick
today were practically completely absent in hunter-gatherer communities:
Infectious diseases like measles, the flu, and even the common cold.
Because most of the worst bacterial and viral pathogens that cause
infectious diseases and make our lives miserable in modern times are new
to our species in evolutionary terms.</p>
<p>In the world our human immune system evolved in hundreds of thousands
of years ago, infectious diseases could not become a major problem
because, with a few exceptions, when you survive an infectious disease,
you usually don’t get it again. Either it kills you or it leaves you
completely immune to it for the rest of your life. For the vast majority
of human history our species lived in small tribes that were spread thin
and, for all intents and purposes, pretty isolated from each other. An
infectious disease simply could not become a dangerous threat and
establish itself in our ancestors effectively. Because if it infected a
tribe, it would infect every available person in no time and then die
off because there would be no one left to jump over. So our evolution
did not really have to consider these sorts of pathogens that much.</p>
<p>As we became farmers and city dwellers our lifestyle changed
forever—and so did the diseases that targeted us. Living close together
created a perfect breeding ground for infectious diseases. Suddenly, in
evolutionary terms, there were hundreds or even thousands of victims to
infect. As our ancestors were not aware of the nature of microorganisms
or even basic hygiene and they did not yet possess tools like soap and
indoor plumbing, there was not much they could do—on the contrary, their
lack of understanding made things worse.</p>
<p>And when they began domesticating and living together with animals in
close quarters, often even sleeping in the same rooms, some pathogens
jumped over. Our new lifestyle turned out to be the perfect environment
for the pathogens of our new animal friends, to adapt to humans and vice
versa. As a consequence, virtually every infectious disease we know
today arose in the last ten thousand years. From cholera, smallpox,
measles, influenza, and the common cold to chicken pox.</p>
<p>And here again, we meet hygiene. Hygiene is incredibly important to
protect us from all of these diseases. In the last two hundred years, as
we discovered the tiny world with its trillions of inhabitants, we began
washing our hands, and we began to clean up and separate our water
supply from the places we pooped. We wrapped our food in sterile
material and put it in cold places so pathogens could not use it as a
shortcut right into our intestines. We started to disinfect things that
we use to cut people open and to properly clean up the stuff we use to
prepare our food. Hygiene is often confused with cleanliness—but you
really should understand it as a targeted approach to remove potentially
dangerous microorganisms from the key places and situations where they
can make you sick.</p>
<p>Hygiene is a great idea that really benefits the health of our
species. This whole point is so important that it is worth repeating:
The microorganisms that are causing infectious diseases are
comparatively new to our biology. Our bodies and immune systems did not
have hundreds of thousands of years to evolve alongside them. Surviving
the measles does not make you tougher, it just makes your life bad for
two weeks. And if your immune system is not in good shape it might also
just kill you. Dangerous pathogens are, well, dangerous.</p>
<p>Clean water has literally saved hundreds of millions of lives.
Hygiene, from washing your hands regularly to making sure your food is
properly stored, is incredibly important—as important as vaccines, if
not more. Hygiene is also a critical line of defense that keeps us safe
from contracting dangerous infections, for example in the case of global
pandemics. Coughing into your elbows, washing your hands regularly and
properly, and wearing masks buys us time for larger-scale interventions,
like vaccines or medication. Hygiene reduces our need to prescribe
antibiotics, which automatically combats antibiotic resistance. It
protects the weaker members of society like small children and seniors,
the immunocompromised, people going through chemotherapy or suffering
from genetic defects.</p>
<p>Still, words are important and hygiene and cleanliness are not the
same thing. For example, the idea that we scrubbed all microorganisms
from our houses and that we live in a sterile world. Nothing could be
further from the truth. After you finish scrubbing your floor and
carefully wiping down your kitchen and bathroom, your home is teeming
with microbes again in no time—even if you used antimicrobial cleaning
products. Microbes rule this planet and they rule your house too.</p>
<p>OK, OK, alright. So hygiene is good. But if it is not hygiene that we
have to blame, what is the cause of the sharp rise of immune defects in
the last fifty years? Well, here it may become counterintuitive because
it all has to do with microbes but in a different way. It seems that to
train your immune system you need to hang out with harmless friends.
Your immune system needs nice playdates to learn when to be gentle and
forgiving. This more nuanced version of looking at interactions with the
microbes around us has been called a few different names, but the nicest
one may be the “Old Friends” Hypothesis, which focuses much more on our
evolution.</p>
<p>For millions of years our bodies and immune systems evolved alongside
and together with the organisms that live in the mud and dirt and plants
around us. Very early in this book we mentioned that you are a
biosphere, surrounded by invaders that want to get in. But you are so
much more. You are also an ecosystem where microorganisms of all kinds
live together with you. Your body would like to get rid of some but
can’t and has to learn to coexist with them, others are neutral, and a
huge group is directly beneficial to your health. These communities of
commensal microorganisms are as essential to your survival and health as
any of your organs. And one of their most important jobs is to train
your immunity.</p>
<p>When you are born, your immune system is like a computer. It has
hardware and software and is in theory able to do a lot of things. But
it doesn’t have a lot of data. It needs to learn which programs it needs
to run and when. Who is a foe and who can be tolerated. So for the first
few years of your life it collects information from its environment. It
collects data from the microorganisms it encounters.</p>
<p>It does so by processing “data” it collects from interactions with
microbes. If it does not get enough microbial data and can’t learn
enough, the risk rises that it will grow up to be overly aggressive and
will later go on to attack harmless substances like peanuts or pollen
from plants.</p>
<p>A really famous study shed some light on how your environment in
early childhood forms your immune system. The study looked at two
distinct groups of farmers in the United States, the Amish in Indiana
and the Hutterites in South Dakota. Both of these populations stemmed
from religious minorities that emigrated from Central Europe to the
United States in the 1700s and 1800s. Both groups have since not mixed
with other populations but stayed genetically isolated, living lives
shaped by similar and strong religious convictions. What made these two
groups so interesting to study and compare is that both are genetically
close, which made it easy to ignore genetics and focus on their
lifestyle differences.</p>
<p>And there is a huge difference between Amish and Hutterites: While
the Amish practice a traditional style of farming, where single families
have their own farms with dairy cows and horses that are used for field
work and for transportation and in general avoid modern technology, the
Hutterites live on large and industrialized communal farms, with
industrial machines and vacuums and many amenities of the modern world.
Consequently, researchers found a much higher rate of microbes and
microbe poop in the houses of the Amish compared to the Hutterites. The
rates of asthma and other allergic disorders are four times higher in
Hutterites than in the Amish. So it seems growing up in a less-urban
environment offers some protection against allergic disorders.</p>
<p>Also, it is fair to conclude that a little bit of dirt does not harm
you, in fact it might be good for you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (or fortunately, you decide for yourself) most people
do not live on farms anymore. Today we don’t surround ourselves with the
kind of diverse microbial ecosystem that we evolved in parallel to. We
isolate ourselves from all kinds of natural environments. There is not
one single factor but a bunch of different ones that all play
together:</p>
<p>The urbanization of the world has sped up drastically in the last
century and in many developed countries the majority of the population
lives in cities. And while not all cities are jungles made purely from
concrete, the distance to something that resembles nature, with all its
critters, makes a big microbial difference. These changes are pretty new
in evolutionary terms because until the early 1800s the vast majority of
the human population lived in rural areas. This development also
coincided with the fact that step-by-step, in the last few decades,
through the advent of entertainment and information technologies from TV
to the internet, we got used to spending the vast majority of our time
inside.</p>
<p>In developed countries, “inside” means an artificial environment made
from processed materials that, while not actually sterile, house a
completely different ecosystem for a different set of microorganisms
than the ones our ancestors adjusted to.</p>
<p>As we said, until very recently in human history, people lived in
houses made from natural materials like wood, mud, and thatch, all full
of microbes that were all too familiar to our immune systems.</p>
<p>Other important factors are what we put into our bodies. Antibiotic
use and overuse was not something our ancestors had to deal with because
there were no antibiotics. Not to say that antibiotics are bad—they have
created a world for us in which we have forgotten how deadly serious a
lot of injuries and infections actually are, because we can just pop a
few pills and not die. But antibiotics are not great at discriminating
between harmful and helpful bacteria, and so they kill your commensal
bacteria, your old friends, too. Aside from the issue of antibiotic
resistance in the pathogens we want to kill, overprescription of
antibiotics is a huge problem for the healthy microbiome.</p>
<p>The problem may start even earlier, literally at the beginning of
life itself: Today a considerable percentage of babies are born via
cesarean section. This is not ideal because in regular births the tiny
human comes in close and intense contact with the vaginal and often
fecal microbiome of their mother. So your birth is actually an important
step in the microbial priming of your body and immune system. The
microbiome of small children varies significantly depending on how they
were born.</p>
<p>Adding another puzzle piece in early life is the fact that fewer
mothers are breastfeeding than in the past. Mothers’ breast skin and
milk contain a vast and diverse array of substances that nurture the
very young microbiome and a number of diverse bacteria. Evolution made
sure that newborns get plenty of face time with the old and proven
microbiome. Both C-sections and the lack of breastfeeding are correlated
with a higher rate of immune disorders like allergies.</p>
<p>Maybe one of the most important differences to our evolutionary past
may be that modern diets contain vastly less fiber than they used to.
Fiber is an important power food for a lot of useful and friendly
commensal bacteria, and the fact that we just eat less and less of it
means that we can’t sustain these little bacteria buddies in the numbers
that we might need them.</p>
<p>Phew, OK, that was a lot. Unfortunately there is not one single clean
and satisfying answer. The immune system is pretty complicated.</p>
<p>All of these changes in human lifestyle did not show their effects
overnight. The transition of our microbial microenvironment and stunted
microbiomes was probably a gradual one that happened only in the last
century or so. As every generation moved a bit farther away from the
natural environment their microbiomes became less diverse and their
children inherited their microbiome. Over time the average diversity of
the microbiome in developed countries seems to have fallen considerably,
especially compared to humans still living a more traditional and rural
lifestyle.</p>
<p>All of these factors together probably made for the less than ideal
situation we have today. But wherever humans grow up with more access to
microorganisms that are old friends, our immune system should fare much
better, and indeed there are a lot of observations that support this
notion. Even in developed countries, a number of studies found that
children who grow up in the countryside and especially on farms,
surrounded by animals and with much more exposure to the outside, suffer
significantly less from immune disorders. So while it doesn’t seem to
make a difference if a house is clean or not, it does make a difference
if it is surrounded by cows and trees and bushes and if dogs roam
freely.</p>
<p>So what can you take away from this chapter? Wash your hands at least
every time you use the restroom, clean your apartment but don’t try to
sterilize it, and clean the tools you use to prepare food properly.</p>
<p>But let your kids play in the forest.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>What is generally troubling about these appeals to naturalism is the
idea itself, that something natural is somehow better. Nature does not
care about you or any individual at all. Your brain and body and immune
system are built on the bones of billions of your would-be ancestors who
were not fast enough to escape a lion, were killed by a mild infection,
or were just a little worse at pulling the nutrients from their food.
Nature gave us charming diseases like smallpox, cancer, rabies, and
parasitic worms that feast on the eyes of your children. Nature is cruel
and without any form of care for you. Our ancestors fought tooth and
nail to build a different world for themselves, a world without all this
suffering and pain and horror. And consequently we should celebrate and
marvel at the enormous progress we’ve made as a species. While we
obviously still have a long way to go and the modern world has a lot of
downsides, the notion that “natural is better” is something only people
who are not actually living in nature can say, and who have forgotten
why our ancestors worked so hard to escape it.</li>
