<h4 id="natural-killers">32 Natural Killers</h4>
<p>Natural Killer Cells are creepy fellows.</p>
<p>They are related to T Cells, but when they grow up they leave the
family business and join the Innate Immune System. Think of them as
children from a family that has served as fighter pilots for
generations, who defy tradition and instead become army grunts. Refusing
to follow the footsteps of their family and the more prestigious role in
the defense and instead purposefully seeking fulfillment in the more
hands-on, brutish ground combat.</p>
<p>Natural Killer Cells are sort of inconspicuous fellows that
nonetheless are one of the few cells with an official license to kill
your own body cells. In a way you can imagine them as inquisitors of the
vast empire of your immune system. Always looking for corruption and
able to act as a judge, jury, and executioner. In a nutshell, Natural
Killer Cells hunt two types of enemies: cells infected by viruses and
cancer cells.</p>
<p>The tactic Natural Killer Cells employ is nothing short of
genius.</p>
<p>Natural Killer Cells do not look inside cells. Even if they wanted
to, they couldn’t—they have no way to look into the display windows, the
MHC class I molecules, and read the story of the inside of the cell.</p>
<p>No, instead they do something different: They check if a cell has MHC
class I molecules. Nothing more, nothing less. This is solely to protect
against one of the best anti–immune system tactics virus and cancer
cells have. Generally cells that are either infected or unhealthy do not
show MHC class I receptors in order to hide what is going on inside
them. Many viruses force infected cells to stop showing them as part of
their invasion strategy, and many cancer cells just stop putting up
display windows, thus making them invisible to the antiviral immune
response that we have shown thus far.</p>
<p>The Adaptive Immune System is now suddenly harmless to these cells.
In a very real way, without their display windows, the infected cells go
dark and become impossible to detect. This is quite an effective tactic
if you think about it—all a virus or cancer cell needs to do is to stop
making a single molecule and boom, the extremely powerful response of
the body is helpless.</p>
<p>So the Natural Killer Cell just checks for one thing: Does a cell
display a window? It does? “Great, please carry on, sir!” It doesn’t?
“Please kill yourself immediately!” That’s right. The Natural Killer
Cell is specifically looking for cells that do not share information
about their insides, that don’t tell stories. The Natural Killer Cell
removes the fatal flaw that otherwise could so easily become deadly.
This is such a simple principle but has such a powerful effect.</p>
<p>While the rest of the immune system looks for the presence of the
unexpected, the presence of something other, Natural Killer Cells look
for the absence of the expected, the absence of self. This principle is
called “The Missing-Self Hypothesis.”</p>
<p>The mechanism of how it works is equally fascinating as the strategy
itself: The Natural Killer Cell is always “on”—when it approaches a cell
it is doing so with the “intention” of killing. To prevent them from
killing healthy cells, they have special receptors that calm them down,
an inhibitor. A large stop sign receptor. The display window, the MHC
class I molecule, is this stop sign, and it fits right into this
receptor.</p>
<p>When Natural Killer Cells check out a civilian cell for infection or
cancer, if they have plenty of MHC class I molecules, as most healthy
cells do, the inhibitor receptor is stimulated and tells the Natural
Killer Cell to chill. If the cell does not have enough MHC molecules
though, there are no calming signals and the Natural Killer Cell, well,
kills.</p>
<p>Killing in this case means that it orders the infected cell to kill
itself through apoptosis, the regular and orderly cell death, which
traps viruses inside the carcass. So Natural Killer Cells are a bit like
nervous agents who are walking through a city, randomly approaching
civilians. Instead of saying hi, they put a gun against your head and
wait a few seconds. If you don’t show them your passport quickly enough,
they pull a plastic bag over your head and shoot you in the face.</p>
<p>Natural Killer Cells are really quite scary guys.</p>
<p>OK—but does this mean that Natural Killer Cells are useless if an
enemy does not try to hide its MHC class I molecules? Not at all, there
is a bit more to this story but the most important part was the display
window. Natural Killer Cells are looking for stress, looking for cells
that are unwell. Not just during an infection, by the way, right now in
this second, millions of these cells patrol your body and check your
civilian cells for signs of stress and corruption, cells that are on the
verge or have already turned into cancer.</p>
<p>Cells have a number of ways to communicate to their environment how
they are and if things are fine and they are well. And there are subtle
ways they can express their inner state that are not quite as obvious as
asking for help. Ways not as obvious as display windows.</p>
<p>Imagine that one of your friends had a bad time in their lives but
they were not ready to tell anybody, but you still might notice that
they smile less, or tend to have a worried expression or don’t react as
enthusiastically to good news as you would expect them to. Because you
know them well, you would pick up these signals and could ask them in a
quiet moment if everything is OK and if you could help.</p>
<p>In a sense this is something Natural Killer Cells can do too with
your civilian cells. If a cell is under a lot of stress—which in this
context means that something is affecting the complex cellular machine,
made of millions of proteins, in a negative way, say for example because
a virus is interrupting the machinery or a cell is becoming cancerous
and not working as it should—the cell will express certain stress
signals on its membrane.</p>
<p>The details of these stress signals are not important, imagine them
like the face of your friend getting more and more unhappy looking. More
stress, more unhappy wrinkles. Natural Killer Cells can detect these
stress signals and they too can take the cell aside to have a nice talk
with them. The difference for you and your Natural Killer Cells is that
they do not want to talk it out and ask if there is anything they can do
to help. If Natural Killer Cells detect too many stress signals, they
shoot the poor stressed-out cell in the head. So if there were
human-size Natural Killer Cells, it would be important to smile a lot
around them!</p>
<p>And this is not all! Remember IgG Antibodies, the all-purpose
Antibody that comes in different flavors? Natural Killer Cells can
interact with them too!</p>
<p>Specifically in case of an influenza A infection they work together
splendidly! Remember that the viruses budded from the infected cell,
taking part of its membrane with them? Well, this process is not
instantaneous but takes a while—enough time for IgG Antibodies to grab
onto a virus before completely detaching. Natural Killer Cells can
connect to these Antibodies before the virus particles detach and order
the infected Cell to kill itself.</p>
<p>Infected Cells are just not safe from Natural Killer Cells.*</p>
<p>OK, now that we have met every major player of your antiviral
defense, let us bring them all together!</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Except, of course, if they are red blood cells. As we said before,
they are the only cells in your body that don’t have MHC class I
receptors, no display windows. This is what happens in malaria—the
parasite plasmodium infects red blood cells and Natural Killer Cells
cannot check these cells for windows and have to do something else to
combat this infection.</li>
