<h4 id="the-arrival-of-the-superweapons">15 The Arrival of the
Superweapons</h4>
<p>Back at the rusty nail battlefield, the first dendritic messengers,
armed with snapshots and information, left days ago, an eternity in cell
time. The soldiers of the Innate Immune System have been fighting the
pathogenic soil bacteria that invaded your tissue vigorously, all this
time. By now they must have killed millions of them. Pushing them back
over and over, only for the bacteria to spread into more surrounding
tissue and resurge with fresh forces. The battlefield is a chaos of dead
civilian and soldier cells, NETS erected by Neutrophils (you know, these
suicide traps that literally look like nets), toxins and feces of
bacteria, alarm signals, and spent complement proteins. Death is
everywhere. Millions of immune cells have fought to their demise. All in
all, the Innate Immune System will probably win this battle eventually.
But it might take weeks and victory is far from certain as there is
still the possibility that the immune system will lose and that the
invaders will make their way deeper into the flesh giant, causing more
mayhem and destruction.</p>
<p>Exhausted by a seemingly endless war, a spent Macrophage slowly moves
over the battlefield looking for bacteria to kill. But it is almost
done. The Macrophage is so, so tired. All it wants to do is to stop
fighting and give up, embrace the sweet kiss of death, and go to sleep
forever. It is about to do so, but then it notices something. Thousands
of new cells arrive at the battlefield and spread out quickly. But these
are not soldiers.</p>
<p>These are Helper T Cells!</p>
<p>Specialist cells from the Adaptive Immune System were forged just for
this particular battle and they exist only to fight this specific soil
bacterium that has been giving the soldiers so much trouble! One of
these Helper T Cells moves around a bit, sniffing and taking in the
environment. It seems to collect itself for a moment. And then it moves
directly towards the tired Macrophage and whispers something, using
special cytokines to convey its message. Suddenly a jolt of energy
shoots through the Macrophage’s bloated body. In a heartbeat, its spirit
comes back and it feels fresh again. But there is something else: A hot,
white anger. The Macrophage knows what it needs to do: Kill bacteria,
right now! Invigorated, it throws itself against the enemies to rip them
into pieces. All over the battlefield this begins to happen as Helper T
Cells whisper magic words to tired soldiers, motivating them to get
themselves together and engage the bacteria again, with even more
violence than before.</p>
<p>But this is not all that is happening. Something weird is going on.
Another tiny army—this time directly made by the Adaptive Immune
System—has joined the fight. Counting in the millions, it floods the
battlefield, dashing against the enemies. The specialist forces of the
Antibodies have arrived! Although they are made from proteins just like
complement, antibodies are very different.</p>
<p>If complement fights like warriors with clubs and claws, antibodies
fight like assassins with sniper rifles. In this case, their purpose is
to maim and disarm this exact kind of bacteria that is present right now
at the site of infection. There is no escape this time. Bacteria hiding
behind cells or trying to escape begin to jerk around as they are being
swamped by thousands of antibodies attaching to them. Even worse,
multiple bacteria are glued together, unable to move or flee.</p>
<p>With help from the Antibodies, your soldiers can suddenly see them
much more clearly and they now seem much more tasty than before, now
that they have been opsonized.</p>
<p>Even the complement system now seems to be more aggressive than
before, as it once again begins attacking and ripping holes into
victims. What had been a desperate and brutal battle for days now turns
into a one-sided slaughter very quickly. The pathogenic bacteria have
nothing to counter the coordinated tactic of the immune system. Step by
step they are eradicated and exterminated without mercy.</p>
<p>At some point the last panicked bacterium is devoured whole by the
once-tired Macrophage. The battle is won. Now the cytokine whisper of
the T Cells slowly subsides and the Macrophages start to feel tired. The
soldiers around it, mostly Neutrophils that fought so bravely, start
killing themselves. Their presence is no longer needed and they know
that they would do more harm than good moving forward. The remains of
their bodies are cleaned up by fresh young Macrophages that will take
their place as the new guardians of the tissue.</p>
<p>Their first job is to help the civilian cells to heal the wound by
sending encouraging messages that motivate them to rebuild. Most of the
Helper T Cells join the controlled mass suicide but some remain at the
former site of infection and settle in to protect the tissue from a
future attack.</p>
<p>The inflammation retracts and blood vessels constrict again, while
the excess fluid leaves the now-former battlefield, transported away
through the lymphatic vessels. The bloated tissue constricts slowly to
its former dimensions. The damaged tissue is already regrowing, young
civilian cells take the place of the fallen. Regeneration is on its
way.</p>
<p>On the human scale, a few days after your unfortunate encounter with
the rusty nail, you wake up and notice that your toe is much better. The
swelling has gone away, the wound has grown over and left nothing but a
faint red mark. Business as usual. Wounds heal, no big deal. You were
completely unaware of the drama your cells had to deal with. For you,
the whole ordeal was a slight annoyance, while for millions of your
cells it was a desperate fight of life and death. They did their duty
and gave their lives to protect you.</p>
<p>What happened here? How were the reinforcements from the Adaptive
Immune System able to swing the situation at the battlefield so
massively and decisively that the bacteria were wiped out? And while you
certainly don’t want to complain, how come your immune system took its
sweet time to get there?</p>
