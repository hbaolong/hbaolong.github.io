<h4 id="cancer-and-the-immune-system">44 Cancer and the Immune
System</h4>
<p>To many people cancer is probably the scariest disease that exists.
Even just saying its name triggers terrified feelings in some. It is the
greatest betrayal you can experience: your own cells deciding that they
no longer want to be part of you.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, cancer is when cells in a certain part of your body
begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably. There are basically two major
categories: When cancer cells form in solid tissue, like your lungs,
muscles, brain, bones, or sexual organs, they form tumors. You can
imagine tumors basically like cells starting a new small village that
eventually grows into a metropolitan area sprawling across the continent
that is your body.</p>
<p>The word tumor originally just means “swelling,” and just like a
swollen body part, a tumor is not automatically a deadly disease. There
are so-called “benign tumors,” which are like the confused cousins of
cancer. The main difference is that benign tumors do not invade other
organ systems, like cancer cells. They basically stay with their friends
and just grow as a physical mass inside your body. And so the outcome
with these tumors are very good—often they only need to be monitored
rather than destroyed or treated. Even benign tumors can become
dangerous though, if they grow too large and begin to press on organs
like your brain or affect vital systems like your blood vessels and
nerves. In these cases usually the tumors are removed with as little
damage to the surrounding tissue as possible. So yeah, tumors suck in
any case, but if you have to pick one, benign tumors are the way to
go.</p>
<p>In contrast to tumor-forming solid cancers, “liquid” cancers affect
your blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system and often start in
your bone marrow, and what basically happens here is that the
superhighways of your vascular and lymphatic systems are overwhelmed and
crowded out by useless cancer cells. (Liquid cancers still are made from
cells, they are not actually liquid.) Leukemia, or blood cancer, is
often used as a sort of catchall name for these kinds of cancers.</p>
<p>Cancer can emerge from basically every type of tissue and cell in
your body. And since you are made up of many different types of cells,
it is not really a single type of cancer, but hundreds of different
ones. Each of them is special and with its own individual challenges.
Some are very slow and can be treated well, while others are very
aggressive and extremely deadly. Almost one in four people alive today
will get cancer during their lifetime. And one in six people will be
killed by it. So basically everybody will get to know someone who has to
deal with the disease at some point in their life.</p>
<p>Despite the horrible harm they cause, cancer cells are not evil. They
don’t want to hurt you. They don’t want anything, really. As we
established, cells are protein robots that just follow their
programming, which unfortunately can be broken and corrupted.</p>
<p>Or not them, but their programming. To make a long story short, your
DNA carries the code of life, building instructions for all the proteins
and parts that make up your cells. These building instructions are
copied and transferred from your DNA to your protein production
machines, your ribosomes, where they are turned into proteins. And the
number and production cycle of different proteins enable your cell to do
different things, like sustain itself, react to stimulation, or behave
in certain ways.</p>
<p>Because this process is so central to life, if your genetic code gets
damaged, it will have consequences down the line. Maybe some proteins
will not be correctly built, or too many or too little of them, all of
which affects how well your cells work. These changes in your DNA are
called mutations—and while this is quite a loaded word, it basically
just means that your code changed a bit. Now, your DNA is damaged and
changed all the time, every second of your life. The genetic code in an
average cell is damaged tens of thousands of times a day, which means in
total you suffer from trillions of tiny mutations each day. This sounds
worse than it is, as almost all of them are either fixed very quickly or
not problematic. So most of the mutations accumulating will be of little
consequence to you.</p>
<p>Still, over time this means that damages are accumulating, just as a
consequence of being alive and having your cells multiply. Remember in
school when some teachers handed out terrible photocopies of worksheets
that were already a bit fuzzy around the edges? Imagine having to make
copies from copies of copies. Over and over again, over years, maybe
decades. Maybe one day a hair got on the scanner or a corner got frayed.
These mistakes became part of the new copies and therefore of all the
copies that followed after that.</p>
<p>In your cells most of this damage just happens through the basic
process of living life, through your cells dividing and keeping the body
going, without any special reason or cause. It is just statistics and
bad luck. You can do a lot to increase your chances of getting cancer
through your lifestyle by doing things that damage your genetic code,
like smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, or being obese, through
contact with carcinogenic substances like asbestos, or simply by
enjoying beautiful summer days without sunscreen.*</p>
<p>All in all, the easiest way to get cancer is to be alive long enough.
It is statistically impossible to not develop some cancer at some point
in your life, even if it ends up not being the cause of your death.</p>
<p>To become cancer, a cell has to mutate in just the right way to
acquire specific corruptions in three different important systems that
work in tandem to prevent cancer.</p>
<p>The first key mutation has to appear in oncogenes, genes monitoring
the growth and proliferation of the cell. For example, some of these
genes were very active when you were an embryo, a small clump of cells.
To turn a single original cell into trillions in mere months, it needs
to divide and grow rapidly, to eventually become a tiny body. These
rapid growth genes are turned off eventually, when there is enough of
you to form a somewhat complete human. Years or decades later, when a
mutation switches these oncogenes on again, the corrupted cell can begin
to divide and proliferate rapidly, just like when it was trying to
create a new human inside a womb. So mutation number one: Rapid
growth.</p>
<p>The second key mutation has to happen in the genes that are
responsible for fixing your broken genetic code, appropriately named
tumor suppressor genes. These genes produce safeguards and control
mechanisms that continuously scan your DNA for mistakes and copying
errors and fix them right away. So if these genes are corrupted or
faulty, your cells basically lose the ability to repair themselves.</p>
<p>But these two specific mutations are still not enough.</p>
<p>Cells usually recognize when their code becomes dangerously broken
and they are at risk of going rogue. If they notice in time, they
trigger their own destruction and kill themselves. So the last group of
genes that needs to be corrupted are the genes that make a cell commit
controlled suicide by apoptosis. We talked about apoptosis a few times
already: it is the way most of your cells end their own lives—a constant
process of self-recycling that prevents your cells from amassing too
many mistakes over time.</p>
<p>If cells lose the ability to kill themselves when it is time, when
they become unable to fix the mistakes that are naturally amassing in
their genetic code, and when they begin to grow without restraint, they
become cancerous and dangerous. Of course, we did simplify a little bit
here. A single mutation in these three systems is usually not enough.
Multiple genes in each of these systems have to mutate in a bad way. But
this is the basic principle underlying cancer.</p>
<p>In a sense, once these damages amass and one of your cells turns into
a cancer cell, it becomes something else. Something ancient and
something new. Over billions of years, evolution molded cells to
optimize themselves to survive and thrive in a hostile environment.
Fighting each other for resources and space. Until a very new and
exciting way of life emerged: Cooperation. A form of cooperation that
allowed for a division of labor and allowed cells to specialize and to
become more successful as a group. But cooperation required sacrifices.
For a multicellular being to be able to stay alive, the cohesion and the
well-being of the collective has to matter more than the survival of the
individual cell.</p>
<p>Cancer cells walk this process back and stop being part of the
collective and in some sense, become individuals again. And that would
be OK in principle. Your body can handle a few cells doing their own
thing and even live in harmony with them. But unfortunately cancer cells
usually do not content themselves with doing their own thing, but divide
and divide, again, and again. They turn from being an individual to a
collective again. A sort of new organism within you. Still part of you
but also not you at all. They take the resources you need to survive,
destroying the organ systems they used to be a part of, and begin
competing for the space that you inhabit.</p>
<p>One might think that evolution should have taken care of this sort of
corruption, but since you tend to get cancer after leaving the
reproductive age, there was little incentive to optimize for good
protection against cancer. In 2017 only 12% of all cancer deaths
happened to people younger than fifty. And so, if you are lucky enough
to get old, you are almost certain to have some amount of cancer cells
inside you, it might just be that other things kill you before those get
a chance.</p>
<p>Because cancer is a constant danger and an existential threat to
survival, the human body in general is actually pretty good at dealing
with it. Or more precisely, your immune system is. It is almost certain
that your immune cells killed a bunch of cancer cells somewhere in your
body while you read the last few chapters.</p>
<p>Over your whole life, some of your cancer cells may have even grown
into small tumors that were eventually wiped out by your defenses. This
might have happened today and you would have no idea that it happened.
So you can rest assured that the vast majority of cancer cells you
develop in your life will be killed without you even noticing. And while
this is great, we don’t care about the 99.99% of occasions where things
went fine, we care about the one time where the immune system is
overcome and a young cancer cell becomes a proper, life-threatening
tumor.</p>
<p>So let us take a look at immunoediting, the back-and-forth, the
struggle between your immune system and the cancer cells. In general it
goes like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Elimination Phase</li>
</ol>
<p>So congratulations, you have a proper cancer cell. It is no longer
able to monitor and repair its genetic code, it can’t kill itself
anymore, and it has lost its restraint and is beginning to multiply
rapidly. And it mutates more with each generation. Not great, not
terrible.</p>
<p>Over a few weeks the cell clones itself uncontrollably, creating at
first thousands, then tens of thousands of copies into a tiny, tiny
patch of cancer. This rapid growth needs a lot of nutrients and
resources. So the mini tumor begins stealing the nutrients from your
body, by ordering the growth of new blood vessels made only to nourish
it. And so the cancer cells cause damage by behaving egotistically. In
its neighborhood, healthy body cells begin to starve and die.</p>
<p>But as we learned before, the unnatural death of civilians attracts
attention, as it causes inflammation and puts your immune system into
ultrahigh alert.</p>
<p>Let us paint a picture that illustrates what happens here: Imagine a
group of people in Brooklyn decided that they were no longer part of New
York City but that they were now a new settlement called Tumor Town
(subtle, I know) that just happens to occupy the same space.</p>
<p>The new city council of Tumor Town is ambitious and wants to create
an amazing new town center, so it orders tons of construction materials
like steel beams, cement, slabs, and drywall and just begins building
new apartment buildings, convenience stores, and industry right in the
middle of the place formerly known as Brooklyn. None of the new
buildings and structures built to code, of course—they are badly
planned, brittle, and dangerous, with sharp edges and dangerously
crooked. Also they look pretty ugly. There is also no apparent logic to
all of it, the new buildings are built right in the middle of streets
and on top of playgrounds and on existing infrastructure. To connect all
of the new construction the old neighborhood is torn down or overbuilt
to make room for new highways and divert traffic and tourists from New
York to Tumor Town. Many of the former residents of Brooklyn are trapped
right in the middle of it. Some grannies are firmly walled in, have no
way to get groceries, and begin to starve.</p>
<p>This goes on for a while until one day, alerted by a lot of
complaints about the stench of dead grannies, NYC building inspectors
and police show up, looking for the people doing the construction.</p>
<p>If we bring this back to your body, attracted by the commotion caused
by the uncontrollably growing cancer, the first immune cells will make
their way to the tumor and invade it: Macrophages and Natural Killers
want to see what is going on. Now, a hallmark of cancer cells is that
they show signs of being “unwell.” Like they don’t have display windows
or just have a lot of stress molecules on their membranes, so Natural
Killer Cells go right to work, killing cancer cells and releasing
cytokines that cause more inflammation, while Macrophages clean up the
bodies.</p>
<p>Through the signals from the Natural Killer Cells, Dendritic Cells
realize that something dangerous is present and activate into danger
mode. They collect samples of dead cancer cells and begin activating
Helper and Killer T Cells in the lymph nodes. You are probably wondering
how the adaptive immune system can have weapons against cancer cells
since they are part of the body.</p>
<p>As we said in the beginning, cancer cells always come with a certain
set of genetic corruptions, which lead to corrupted proteins. Some of
your adaptive immune cells have receptors that are able to connect to
these proteins. In any case, by the time your adaptive immune cells
arrive, the tumor has grown to hundreds of thousands of cells but this
is about to change. T Cells begin by blocking the growth of new blood
vessels, which starves many of the cancer cells outright or at least
makes it very hard for the tumor to grow further. Imagine the building
inspectors in Tumor Town putting up roadblocks and ending the transfer
of tourists and resources into the new illegal city.</p>
<p>The Killer T Cells scan the tumor cells’ display windows for
malformed proteins that should not be there and order them to kill
themselves. Natural Killer Cells kill the cancer cells that have hidden
their MHC molecule windows. With no possibility of hiding and no way to
order fresh nutrients from the blood, the tumor collapses. It is a
massacre and hundreds of thousands of cancer cells perish. Their
carcasses are cleaned up and consumed by Macrophages. Imagine that as
New York City would tear down illegal construction, your body crushes
the illegal tumor. Except…something did not go as planned.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Equilibrium</li>
</ol>
<p>While the battle seemed to be over, natural selection spoils your
sweet victory. The initial response of the immune system was very
effective. Your immune cells killed the cancer cells that were so kind
to let them know that something was seriously wrong with them. Which is
exactly how your cells are set up—they are supposed to signal that they
are broken—it is actually a sign that they are not completely corrupted
yet. Under normal circumstances this is enough and the tumor is
eliminated.</p>
<p>But if things go wrong, the cancer cells have time to corrupt even
more, a little bit like the viruses that we met before. As they multiply
rapidly and unchecked, there are more opportunities for new mistakes in
their genetic code to appear, especially since their self-repair
mechanisms are already damaged.</p>
<p>The longer these cancer cells are alive and the more they
proliferate, the higher the chances that they acquire new mutations that
turn out to make them a tiny bit better at hiding from the immune
system. And as evolution goes, by doing its best to destroy the cancer,
your immune system is selecting the most fit cancer cells. In the end,
hundreds of thousands of cancer cells died. Maybe even millions. But a
single cancer cell is still here and has found ways to fight back
efficiently.</p>
<p>For example, one of the genius and horrifying methods cancer cells
have to protect themselves from the immune system is targeting inhibitor
receptors on Killer T Cells and on Natural Killer Cells. Inhibitor
receptors inhibit these cells from, well, killing. They are a sort of
off switch that deactivates Killer Cells before they can attack a cell
and destroy it—which in principle is a good idea. We’ve hit on the fact
of how dangerous your immune system is many times, and there need to be
mechanisms to stop overeager immune cells, so inhibitor receptors play
an important role in the complex concert of your immune system. But
unfortunately cancer cells can mutate in a way where they are able to
shut down your Killer Cells.</p>
<p>So now we have a cancer cell that is able to shut down the defenses
of the immune system. And so a new tumor begins growing, producing
thousands of new clones that are changing and mutating again.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Escape</li>
</ol>
<p>The new cancer cells that were molded and formed by the
countermeasures of your immune system are the ones that will eventually
cause all the trouble. In a perverse way they become immune to the
immune system. They do not show their broken nature on their surfaces.
They do not release too many signals that alarm the body. They are quiet
while hiding in plain sight. They are actively shutting down the immune
system by sending corrupt signals. And they are growing. As the tumor is
expanding it again begins killing healthy tissue and this is attracting
attention—but this time the tumor is no longer a pushover. The final
phase begins: Escape.</p>
<p>The cancer cells begin creating their own world, the cancer
microenvironment.</p>
<p>If we think back to Tumor Town in Brooklyn, everything is different
this time. The town has been rebuilt but now the new city council has
forged all sorts of permits that confuse the NYC building inspectors. No
longer are they able to order the destruction of the sprawling Tumor
Town that is slowly taking over the city. This time new roadblocks make
sure no inspectors can enter the rapidly growing, illegal settlement and
check if the fake permits are correct. The cancer cells have created a
sort of borderland that is hard to cross for your immune cells.</p>
<p>If all of these things come together the cancer has basically won and
tamed the immune system successfully. All avenues of attack have been
shut down and uncontrollable growth is the consequence. In the end, if
left untreated, these new and optimized cancer cells become metastatic,
which means that they want to explore the world and expand into other
tissues or organs, where they continue growing. If this affects vital
organs like the lungs, the brain, or the liver, the intricate and
complex machine that is your body begins breaking down.</p>
<p>Imagine installing new but useless parts into your car engine every
day—your car will work for a while but at some point the engine will no
longer start. This is how cancer kills you in the end. By taking up so
much space and stealing so many nutrients that your true self has no
room to properly function anymore and your affected organs have to shut
down. This, in a nutshell, is how cancer overcomes your immune system.
Although, as we’ll discuss in the last chapter of this book, your immune
system might also be the key to successfully overcoming cancer, or at
least to make it much less deadly.</p>
<p>But for now, since we are already talking about cancer, let us look
at something you can do to actively increase your chances of getting it
and the role your immune system plays here!</p>
