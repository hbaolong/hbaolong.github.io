<h4 id="the-dance-of-the-t-and-the-b">22 The Dance of the T and the
B</h4>
<p>One thing that we elegantly avoided mentioning so far is how good the
B Cell receptors are at recognizing antigens. Earlier we described these
receptors and antigens as puzzle pieces fitting together perfectly.
Well, that was sort of a lie, sorry. As it is said, perfect is the enemy
of good, and during a dangerous infection your immune system has no time
to wait for the perfect match—it really is cool with a good or even
OK-ish match. So B Cells can get activated if their receptors are good
enough at recognizing an antigen.</p>
<p>The immune system evolved this way because it is better to have some
working weapons as quickly as possible than perfect weapons after all
the damage is already done. But this also weakens your immune defense.
As we said, on the level of proteins, shape is everything, and having
Antibodies with a really good shape that fits really well on an antigen
is an incredible advantage that can mean the difference between life and
death. And your immune system wants it all, a quick response and then a
perfect defense.</p>
<p>So your immune system came up with a way to produce OK-ish Antibodies
as fast as possible but also with an ingenious system to fine-tune and
improve the Antibodies, so they become actually perfect weapons against
the antigen. It all starts with a dance.</p>
<p>We said before that B Cells need to be activated by Helper T Cells
(that were activated themselves by Dendritic Cells) to turn into Plasma
Cells but actually this process is a tad more amazing and sophisticated.
Your immune system makes sure that only B Cells that are able to make
amazing Antibodies turn into Plasma Cells. OK, so how does this
work?</p>
<p>Well to be honest it is a bit of a hot mess so we will simplify a bit
here. In a nutshell, if a T Cell recognizes an antigen that a B Cell
presents to them, it stimulates the B Cell. This stimulation is like a
gentle kiss or a warm encouraging hug. Not only does this prolong the
life of the B Cell, it also motivates it to try to improve the
Antibody!</p>
<p>Every time a B Cell receives a positive signal from a Helper T Cell,
it begins a round of purposeful mutation. This process is called Somatic
Hypermutation (also known as Affinity Maturation) and we will never use
this clunky term again.</p>
<p>Like a cook that works and improves a recipe that got praise from
food critics, the B Cell begins to enhance and refine the recipe. The B
Cell mutates the gene fragments that make its receptors, and therefore
its antibodies.</p>
<p>What B Cells do here is basically go back into the kitchen during the
dinner party. At this point the guests have shown up and they know what
sort of dinner they want to eat. So now they begin to randomly change
the recipes a little bit here and there. The goal is to make just the
perfect dish, just like a three-star Michelin restaurant. Not good, not
great, perfect! So maybe in the original recipe, the carrots were finely
chopped and the beef was roasted. Now the B Cell might cut the carrots
into sticks and grill the beef instead. No new ingredients but
fine-tuning the way they come together to create the final dish.</p>
<p>The goal is to engineer the perfect dinner for the guests, something
so good they will be ecstatic. The perfect Antibody for the pathogens.
But how do your B Cell chefs find out if the guests like the enhanced
recipe more than the original one, if their new Antibody is a better fit
than the original one? Well, exactly the same way the B Cells were
activated in the first place: They basically bathe their new and
improved receptors in the stream of lymph from the battlefield that is
passing through the lymph node. If a battle is still ongoing there
should be plenty of antigen passing through.</p>
<p>If the random mutation (the fine-tuning of the dish) made the B Cell
receptor worse, then it will have a harder time picking up antigens. It
will not get stimulation and kisses from T Cells. Which will make it sad
and after a while it will kill itself.</p>
<p>But if the mutation improved the B Cell receptor it will now be even
better at recognizing the antigen and the B Cell will get an activation
signal once again! Once this happens, it takes in the chunk of antigen
(the turkey drumstick) and cuts it into many smaller pieces (the
wieners) and once again tries to present them to a Helper T Cell. You
can imagine this as if the B Cell chef is super excited and happy about
their improved recipe and wants to tell the world about it!</p>
<p>In our cooking metaphor the Helper T Cells might be a food critic
coming from the dining room and showering the B Cell in praise and
kisses. And this encouragement motivates your B Cell chefs to improve
the dishes even more! And the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>Over time a natural selection takes place. The better B Cell
receptors become at recognizing the antigen that flows through the lymph
node, the more stimulation and encouragement they get. While at the same
time, the B Cells that get worse or don’t improve kill themselves.</p>
<p>In the end only the best possible B Cells survive and go on to make
many new clones of themselves! These are the B Cells that eventually
turn into Plasma Cells, that fine-tuned their receptors and are able to
make the best possible weapons against the enemy. This is the reason
Antibodies are so deadly effective, why they hit an enemy between the
eyes like a sniper. They were not just randomly chosen, they were molded
and improved and fine-tuned until they were perfect. This is the reason
that even if you know nothing about the immune system, you have probably
heard the term “Antibody” a bunch of times from medical professionals.
They are your superweapons, the main reason you can survive serious
infections.</p>
<p>This mechanism makes the Adaptive Immune System actually adapt to the
enemy in real time. We asked before how you could keep up with the
billions of different enemies that are also able to change themselves.
This is one way. A system that can replicate very quickly, that has a
defined target and can adapt to it fast, that fine-tunes and improves
its weapons until they are perfect. What a beautiful and ingenious
solution that shows that the Adaptive Immune System really deserves its
name—it truly can beat microbes at their own game.</p>
<p>If you made it through the last two chapters—great job. And I mean
that, this stuff is not easy and believe it or not, this is the
simplified version. The immune system and the universe in general are
unfortunately not made to be intuitively understood by apes with
smartphones, and sometimes this makes it really hard to do a deep dive,
even if a topic is important. You don’t need to remember everything you
just read in detail.</p>
<p>Actually, I would wager that it is impossible to exactly recall what
you just learned by reading this chapter only once. And that is totally
OK. You learned principles and also you made it through the hardest part
of the book! This was the complexity peak and from now on it’s pretty
smooth sailing for the most part! We are also almost back at telling
crazy battle stories!</p>
<p>To get the full picture of the immune system we only need to talk
about the actual weapons—the sniper rifles!</p>
