<h4 id="what-is-the-immune-system">1 What Is the Immune System?</h4>
<p>The story of the immune system begins with the story of life itself,
almost 3.5 billion years ago, in some strange puddle on a hostile and
vastly empty planet. We don’t know what these first living beings did,
or what their deal was, but we know they very soon started to be mean to
each other. If you think life is hard because you need to get up early
in the morning to get your kids ready for the day, or because your
burger is only lukewarm, the first living cells on earth would like a
word with you. As they figured out how to transform the chemistry around
them into stuff they could use while also acquiring the energy needed to
keep going, some of the first cells took a shortcut. Why bother with
doing all the work yourself if you could just steal from someone else?
Now, there were a number of different ways to do that, like swallowing
someone else whole, or ripping holes into them and slurping out their
insides. But this could be dangerous, and instead of getting a free
meal, you could end up as the meal of your intended victim, especially
if they were bigger and stronger than you. So another way to get the
prize with less of the risk might be to just get inside them and make
yourself comfortable. Eat what they eat and be protected by their warm
embrace. Kind of beautiful, if it wasn’t so horrible to the host.</p>
<p>As it became a valid strategy to become good at leeching from others,
it became an evolutionary necessity to be able to defend yourself
against the leeches. And so microorganisms competed and fought each
other with the weapons of equals for the next 2.9 billion years. If you
had a time machine and went back to marvel at the wonders of this
competition, you would be pretty bored, as there was nothing big enough
to see other than a few faint films of bacteria on some wet rocks. Earth
was a pretty dull place for the first few billion years. Until life
made, arguably, the single largest jump in complexity in its
history.</p>
<p>We don’t know what exactly started the shift from single cells that
were mostly on their own to huge collectives working closely together
and specializing.*</p>
<p>Around 541 million years ago, multicellular animal life suddenly
exploded and became visible. And not only that, it became more and more
diverse, extremely quickly. This, of course, created a problem for our
newly evolved ancestors. For billions of years the microbes living in
their tiny world had competed and fought for space and resources in
every ecosystem available. And what are animals really to a bacteria and
other critters if not a very nice ecosystem? An ecosystem filled top to
bottom with free nutrients. So from the very start intruders and
parasites were an existential danger to the existence of multicellular
life.</p>
<p>Only multicellular beings that found ways to deal with this threat
would survive and get the chance to become even more complex.
Unfortunately, since cells and tissues do not really preserve well over
hundreds of millions of years, we can’t look at immune system fossils.
But through the magic of science we can look at the diverse tree of life
and the animals that are still around today and study their immune
systems. The farther separated two creatures are on the tree of life and
still share a trait of the immune system, the older that trait must
generally be.</p>
<p>So the great questions are: Where is the immune system different, and
what are the common denominators between animals? Today virtually all
living beings have some form of internal defense, and as living things
become more complex, so do their immune systems. We can learn a lot
about the age of the immune system by comparing the defenses in very
distantly related animals.</p>
<p>Even on the smallest scale, bacteria possess ways to defend against
viruses, as they can’t get taken over without a fight. In the animal
world, sponges, the most basic and oldest of all animals, which have
existed for more than half a billion years, possess something that
probably was the first primitive immune response in animals. It is
called humoral immunity. “Humor,” in this context, is an ancient Greek
term that means “bodily fluids.” So humoral immunity is very tiny stuff,
made out of proteins, that floats through the bodily fluids outside of
the cells of an animal. These proteins hurt and kill microorganisms that
have no business being there. This type of defense was so successful and
useful that virtually all animals around today have it, including you,
so evolution did not phase this system out, but rather, made it crucial
to any immune defense. In principle, it hasn’t changed in half a billion
years.</p>
<p>But this was only the start. Being a multicellular animal has the
perk of being able to employ many different specialized cells. So it
probably did not take animals too long, in evolutionary terms, to get
cells that did just that: Specialize in defense. This new cell-mediated
immunity was a success story right from the start. Even in worms and
insects we find specialized soldier immune cells that move freely
through the tiny critter bodies and can fight intruders head-on. The
further up we climb the evolutionary tree, the more sophisticated the
immune system becomes. But already, on the earliest branch of the
vertebrate part of the tree of life, we see major innovations: The first
dedicated immune organs and cell training centers, together with the
emergence of one of the most powerful principles of immunity—the ability
to recognize specific enemies and quickly produce a lot of dedicated
weapons against them, and then to remember them in the future!</p>
<p>Even the most primitive vertebrates, jawless fish, who look
ridiculous, have these mechanisms available to them. Over hundreds of
millions of years, these defense systems got more and more sophisticated
and refined. But in a nutshell, these are the basic principles, and they
work well enough that they were probably around in some forms around
half a billion years ago. So while the defenses you have at your
disposal today are pretty great and developed, the underlying mechanisms
are extremely widespread and their origins reach back hundreds of
millions of years. Evolution did not have to reinvent the immune system
over and over again—it found a great system and then refined it.</p>
<p>Which finally brings us to humanity. And to you. You get to enjoy the
fruits of hundreds of millions of years of immune system refinement. You
are the height of immune system development. Although, your immune
system is not really inside of you. It is you. It is an expression of
your biology protecting itself and making your life possible. So when we
are talking about your immune system, we are talking about you.</p>
<p>But your immune system is also not a singular thing. It is a complex
and interconnected collection of hundreds of bases and recruitment
centers all over your body. They are connected by a superhighway, a
network of vessels, similarly vast and omnipresent as your
cardiovascular system. Even more, there is a dedicated immune organ in
your chest, as big as a chicken wing, that gets less efficient as you
age.</p>
<p>On top of organs and infrastructure, dozens of billions of immune
cells patrol either these superhighways or your bloodstream and are
ready to engage your enemies when called. Billions more sit guard in the
tissue of your body that borders your outsides waiting for invaders to
cross them. On top of these active defenses you have other defense
systems made up of quintillions of protein weapons that you can think of
as self-assembling, free-floating land mines. Your immune system also
has dedicated universities where cells learn who to fight and how. It
possesses something like the largest biological library in the universe,
able to identify and remember every possible invader that you may ever
encounter in your life.</p>
<p>At its very core, the immune system is a tool to distinguish the
other from the self. It does not matter if the other means to harm you
or not. If the other is not on a very exclusive guest list that grants
free passage, it has to be attacked and destroyed because the other
might harm you. In the world of the immune system, any “other” is not a
risk worth taking. Without this commitment you would die within days.
And as we will learn later, sadly, when your immune system under- or
overcommits, death or suffering are the consequences.</p>
<p>While identifying what is self and what is other is the core, it is
not technically the goal of your immune system. The goal above all
things is maintaining and establishing homeostasis: the equilibrium
between all the elements and cells in the body. Something that can’t be
overemphasized enough about the immune system is how much it tries to be
balanced and how much care it puts into calming itself down and not
overreacting. Peace, if you so want. A stable order that makes being
alive pleasant and easy. The thing that we call health. The basis for a
good and free life where we can do what we desire, not held back by pain
and disease.</p>
<p>How crucial health is becomes the most apparent when it is missing.
Health is really an abstract concept because it describes the absence of
something. The absence of suffering and pain, the absence of
limitations. If you are healthy, you feel normal, you feel right. Once
you witness your health go away, even for a brief time, it is hard to
forget how fragile you are and how much you are living on borrowed time.
Disease is an unavoidable fact of life. If you have been lucky, you have
not had to face it up to this point. If you or one of your loved ones
has had to deal with it already, you know that nothing is more elemental
for a pleasant life than being healthy. To the immune system, this means
homeostasis. While the battle to stay healthy is ultimately futile and
will be lost in the end, we still fight it to carve out more years,
months, days, and hours. Because, overall, it is pretty good to be a
human and it is worth it to have this experience a little bit
longer.</p>
<p>But health is a hard thing to maintain because every day of your life
you are in contact with hundreds of millions of bacteria and viruses
that would love to make your body their home, as we saw in those
single-celled organisms billions of years ago. For a microorganism you
are an ecosystem waiting to be conquered. An endless continent full of
resources, breeding grounds, and opportunities to thrive, a really nice
home. Arguably at some point they will succeed, as when you die, the
decomposition of your body will be immensely sped up by an army of
unhinged microbes no longer kept in check by your defenses.</p>
<p>And not only do you need to worry about the plethora of life trying
to get inside, but also about your own misguided self that can cancel
the social contract of the body: Cancer. Making sure that doesn’t happen
is one of the most important jobs of your immune system. In fact, while
you were reading the last few pages, somewhere inside you a young cancer
cell was quietly eliminated by your immune cells.</p>
<p>But the part meant to protect you also can go wrong and be corrupted.
When it is tricked, your immune system can help diseases spread or
protect cancer cells from detection. Or if the system is out of tune or
flawed, it can get confused and decide that the body itself is the
enemy. It can decide that self is other and literally start attacking
the cells it exists to protect, resulting in any number of autoimmune
diseases that need constant calming by medication, sometimes with harsh
side effects.</p>
<p>Or take allergies, which are a very intense reaction of your immune
system against things it should not be concerned about. An allergic
shock shows strikingly how truly powerful your defense system is and how
horribly it can go wrong: it may take a disease days to kill you—your
immune system can do so in minutes.</p>
<p>Oh, and even if your immune system works as intended, it can be as
much of a burden as it is helpful: Many of the unpleasant symptoms you
feel when you are sick are the consequences of your immune system doing
its job when activated—in some diseases the most crushing damage or even
death are caused by an unhinged response to an intrusion. For example,
many deaths from COVID-19 come from the immune system doing its job with
too much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The collateral damage your defense networks dish out against you can
build up over time and today it is thought that many deadly diseases
start with your immune system working as intended. So as important as it
is for your health to have an immune system that is fast and brutal, it
is just as important to keep it in check and prevent it from becoming
unhinged and destructive. Just like in the human world, if you need to
go to war, you at least want your wars to be over quickly and end with a
clean victory. You don’t want decades of occupation or conflict that eat
up resources and leave destroyed infrastructure.</p>
<p>So in the hands of your immune system lies an enormous responsibility
to keep you well for as long as possible. Even if the battle will
certainly be lost in the end, it matters to you today, right now, that
it is fought well and with the necessary responsibility.</p>
<p>To summarize, distinguishing between self and other is core,
homeostasis is the goal, and there are seemingly infinite ways for it to
all go wrong.</p>
<p>What makes the immune system so fascinating is that all of this
complex work has to be done by parts that are mindless and,
individually, pretty dumb. And yet they are able to coordinate and react
to dynamic and quickly developing situations. Imagine the Second World
War happening, but ten times as large and without generals. Only
mindless immune soldiers on the ground trying to figure out if they need
tanks or fighter jets and where they need to go. And it all happens
within days. That’s what it is like for you to battle even a common
cold.</p>
<p>So now let us discover your immune system, so the next time you step
into the shower, annoyed about the cold symptoms you are feeling, you
can at least pause for a moment to appreciate what is going on inside
you before you go back to being annoyed.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Although funnily enough, it may actually have been a side effect of
single-celled organisms being mean to each other. As at one point one
cell swallowed another but did not devour it. Instead these two cells
started arguably the most successful partnership on planet Earth that is
still going strong today. The “inside cell” (that we know as
“mitochondria” today) specialized in making energy available for the
host, while the “outside cell” offered protection and delivered free
food. This deal worked very well and enabled the new super cell to grow
in complexity and become more and more sophisticated.</li>
