<h4 id="superhighways-and-megacities">14 Superhighways and
Megacities</h4>
<p>Consider the continent of the flesh again for a moment, the sheer
scale of a human from the perspective of a cell. For a cell, you are a
gigantic mountain of meat, more than ten times the height of Mount
Everest. Not just a uniform pile of flesh, though, but organized into
many different nations and countries that perform the most diverse
jobs—from a network of high-voltage electric wires that transfers the
orders and instructions of the thinking nation of the brain to the acid
ocean of the stomach and the united nations of the gut that process raw
resources and transform them into neat food packages, which are then
distributed by oceans of fluid filled with delivery swimmers.</p>
<p>And among all of these systems and nations, there is the megacity and
superhighway network of your immune system: The Lymphatic System. It
does not get as much love in textbooks because it is not as clear-cut
and obviously useful as the heart with its blood vessels or the brain
with its electric wiring. It does not have a giant, central organ like
your liver but hundreds of tiny ones. But just like your cardiovascular
system, it does have a far-reaching network of vessels and its own
special fluid. And without it, you would be equally dead as without a
heart. Let’s explore it briefly.</p>
<p>Your network of lymphatic vessels is miles long and covers your
entire body. It is a sort of partner system to your blood vessels and
blood. The main job of your blood is to carry resources like oxygen to
every cell in the body and to do that, some of the blood needs to
actually leave your blood vessels and drain into your tissue and organs
to deliver the goods directly to your cells. (Which makes total sense if
you think about it for a moment but still feels a bit weird.) Most of
that blood is then reabsorbed by your blood vessels. But some of its
liquid parts remain in the tissue between your cells and need to be
transported back into circulation again. The lymphatic system is
responsible for this job. It sort of constantly drains your body and
tissues of excess fluid and delivers it back to the blood where it can
circulate again—if it didn’t, you would swell up like a balloon over
time.</p>
<p>Your lymphatic system begins as a tight and complex network of
capillaries spread throughout your tissue. Vessels, bulky and irregular.
They are built like a series of one-way valves—water can enter them from
the tissue but it cannot flow back. There is only one direction, as very
gradually small lymph vessels merge into bigger ones, which then
continue to merge into larger ones. Since the lymphatic system has no
real heart, the water flows slowly. If a cell were the size of a human,
your blood would be like a roaring stream, moving multiple times faster
than the speed of sound. In contrast, traveling through the lymphatic
vessels would be like taking a chill cruise with sightseeing and no
rush.</p>
<p>Your heart pumps and transports nearly 2,000 gallons of blood through
your body every single day, while your lymphatic system only transports
around three quarts from your tissues back to your blood. This slow
movement is made possible by negative pressure and by a very thin muscle
layer that surrounds the vessels. You could imagine this as a very thin,
spread-out, pump-like pseudo-heart that covers your whole body and only
beats once every four to six minutes.*1</p>
<p>The fluid transported through the lymphatic system is called lymph,
and if you find blood a bit disgusting, you won’t like lymph either. It
is mostly clear, but in some places, like your gut region, it can be
yellowish-white and look like old, gross milk. It gets this color
because it does not just transport water, it is also your waste
management and alarm system. When it drains the excess fluid between
your cells, it picks up all sorts of detritus and garbage: damaged and
destroyed body cells, dead or sometimes even alive bacteria or other
invaders, and all sorts of chemical signals and stuff just hanging
out.</p>
<p>This is especially important if you are suffering from an infection
because your lymph picks up a sort of cross section of the chemicals
that float around battlefields and transports them directly to your
immune system intelligence centers, your lymph nodes, where they are
filtered and analyzed.*2</p>
<p>But while the lymph carries many different things, maybe its most
important job is to serve as a superhighway for immune cells. Every
second of your life, billions of them are traveling through it, looking
for a job. These jobs are given out in the megacities of your immune
system that the lymph must pass through before it can become part of the
blood again: Your bean-shaped Lymph Node megacities—the organs of your
immune system. You have around 600 of them spread all over your
body.</p>
<p>Most surround your intestines, are in your armpit, neck, and head
region, or are near the groin. You can try to touch them right now. Put
your head back and carefully feel for them in the soft region below the
corners of your jaw. If they are too small to feel right now, you can
feel them for sure when you have a sore throat or a cold as they will
swell and feel like weird, firm lumps. The lymph node megacities are
like huge dating platforms where the Adaptive Immune System meets the
Innate Immune System for hot dates. Or better, adaptive immune cells go
and look for their ideal match. This is where the traveling Dendritic
Cell arrives from the battlefield after about a day of chill travel.</p>
