<h4 id="what-are-your-cells">3 What Are Your Cells?</h4>
<p>We’ve talked an awful lot about cells so far and will do so even more
in the rest of this book. In order to understand your body, your immune
system, and the diseases it fights, from cancer to the flu, you need a
base understanding of its building blocks. It helps that cells are maybe
the most fascinating part of biology. After this chapter we will zoom
out again and meet your immune system in earnest.</p>
<p>So what exactly is a cell and how does it work?</p>
<p>As we said, cells are the smallest units of life: things that we can
clearly identify as something that is alive. The definition of life is a
big, complicated, brain-melting affair in itself. We know it when we see
it but it is very hard to define. In general there are a few properties
that we assign to it: Something alive separates itself from the universe
around it. It has a metabolism, meaning it takes up nutrients from the
outside and gets rid of internal garbage. It responds to stimuli. It
grows and it can make more of itself. Cells do all these things. And you
are made almost entirely from them. Your muscles, organs, skin, and hair
are made up of cells. Your blood is filled with them. Being as small as
they are, they are not conscious, they do not have free will or feelings
or goals or make active decisions. In a nutshell, cells are biological
robots, driven entirely by myriads of biochemical reactions guided by
the even smaller parts they are made up from.</p>
<p>Your cells have “organs” that are called organelles, like the
nucleus, the information center of your cell—a pretty large structure
with its own protective border wall that houses your DNA, your genetic
code. There are mitochondria, generators that transform food and oxygen
into chemical energy that keeps your cells running. There is a
specialized transport network, a packaging center, parts for digestion
and recycling, construction centers. When we learn about cells, they are
often illustrated as sort of empty bags filled with these organelles.
But this image gives the wrong impression of how much they are buzzing
with complex activity. Look around the room you are sitting in right
now.*1</p>
<p>Now imagine the room to be filled top to bottom with stuff. Millions
of grains of sand, millions of grains of rice, and a few thousand apples
and peaches and a dozen large watermelons. This is sort of what the
inside of a cell looks like. What does this mean in reality?</p>
<p>A single human cell is filled up with dozens of millions of
individual molecules. Half of them are water molecules, in our metaphor
represented by the grains of sand that give the insides of your cells a
consistency that is kind of like soft jelly and enable other things to
move around easily. Because on this scale water is no longer a thin
fluid but viscous and honey-like.*2</p>
<p>The other half of your cells’ insides consists mostly of millions of
proteins. Between 1,000 and 10,000 different kinds—depending on the
function of the cell and what it needs to get done. In our room example,
they would be the rice and most of the fruits. The watermelons are the
organelles that we always see in pictures of cells. So your cells are
mostly made from and filled up with proteins.</p>
<p>We need to briefly talk about proteins because they are super
important to understanding the immune system and your cells and the
microworld they live in. They are so important that it is OK to call
your cells protein robots. You may have heard of proteins mostly in the
context of food—maybe you even are on a protein-rich diet, especially if
you are working out a lot and are trying to build up muscle. Which makes
sense because the solid, nonfat parts of your body are mostly made out
of protein (even your bones are made from a mix of proteins and
calcium). But proteins are not just good for muscles: Proteins are the
most fundamental organic building blocks and tools of all living things
on this planet. They are so useful and manifold that a cell can use them
for basically everything, from sending signals to constructing simple
walls and structures to complex micromachines.</p>
<p>Proteins are made from chains of amino acids, which are tiny organic
building blocks that come in twenty different varieties. All you need to
do is to string them together into a chain, in whatever order you like,
and voila, you have a protein. This principle enables life to construct
a stunning variety of different things. For example, if you wanted to
make a simple protein from a chain of ten amino acids, and you have
twenty different amino acid types that you can choose from, this gives
you a breathtaking 10,240,000,000,000 different possible proteins.</p>
<p>Imagine having a casino slot machine, with twenty different symbols
and ten different slots. It is hard enough to get the same symbol on a
machine with three slots—imagine how many possible combinations on your
protein slot machine. A typical protein is usually made from between 50
and 2,000 amino acids (which would be the equivalent of a slot machine
with 50 to 2,000 slots) and the longest ones we know of are made from up
to 30,000. This gives us billions of billions of potentially useful
proteins our cells can make.</p>
<p>Of course, most of these possible proteins will be useless. According
to some estimates, only one in a million to a billion possible amino
acid combinations will yield a useful protein. But since there are so
many possible proteins, one in a billion is still plenty! How do your
cells know in which order to put amino acids to make the proteins they
need?</p>
<p>Well, this is the job of the code of life: Your DNA, a long sequence
of instructions that are necessary for a living thing to be a living
thing. What this means in this context is that around 1% of the DNA is
made up of sequences that are building manuals for proteins, which are
called Genes. The rest of your DNA is regulating which proteins are
built when and how and how many of them at which time. So proteins are
so crucial to living beings that the code of life is basically an
instruction manual for building them. But how does this work? Well, very
briefly, and only because this will become important later on when we
talk about viruses: In a nutshell, the instructions on the DNA are
converted into proteins in a two-step process: Special proteins read the
information on the DNA string and convert it into a special messenger
molecule called mRNA—basically the language that our DNA uses to
communicate orders.</p>
<p>The mRNA molecule is then transported from the nucleus of the cell to
another organelle, the protein production machinery called the ribosome.
Here the mRNA molecule is read and translated into amino acids, that are
then put together in the order inscribed into it. And voila, the cell
has made a protein from your DNA. So your DNA is basically a bunch of
code, with sections called genes, that are a protein-building and
regulation manual for your cellular machinery. And this does actually
translate into all the features that you as an individual call your own:
Your height, your eye color, how susceptible to certain diseases you
are, or if you have curly hair. Your DNA doesn’t tell your body “make
curly hair!”—it tells your cells “make these proteins.” In a really
simplified sense, all of your personal traits manifest this way.</p>
<p>You have a lot of this genetic code—if you were to untangle the DNA
of a single one of your cells, it would be about two meters long. That’s
right, the DNA inside every one of your cells is in all likelihood
longer than you are tall. If we took all of your DNA from your body and
combined it into one long string, it would reach from Earth to Pluto and
back. And all of that code just to make long chains of amino
acids!*3</p>
<p>As these amino acid chains are made, they transform and change from a
long 2D string into a 3D structure. This means that they are folding in
on themselves in really complicated ways that we haven’t fully
deciphered yet. Depending on the types of amino acids and the sequence
they are put together in, the chain folds together into specific
shapes.</p>
<p>In the world of proteins shape determines what they can and can’t do.
Shape is everything. In a way, you can imagine proteins like really
complex three-dimensional puzzle pieces. Depending on their shape,
proteins are the ultimate tool and construction material. A cell can use
them to build basically everything. But the magic of proteins goes
beyond being merely construction materials. Proteins are used as
messengers that convey information: They can receive or send signals
that change their shape and trigger intensely complicated chain
reactions. For your cells, proteins are everything. Think back to the
room filled with rice and peaches and apples. All these proteins are
actually not like spheres but more like an unfathomably complex mix of
gears and wheels and switches and domino pieces and tracks.</p>
<p>As long as your cell is alive it is always moving and shifting.
Wheels spin and tip over dominos, which push switches and pull levers
and ferry marbles around on tracks that then spin more wheels, and so
on. If you want to get metaphysical, the spirit of the cell robot is
both the proteins and the biochemistry guiding them.</p>
<p>Some of the most common proteins are extremely plentiful inside your
cells, with up to half a million individual copies. Others are
specialized and exist fewer than ten times in total. But they don’t just
float around doing their own thing. All these tiny little protein puzzle
pieces and structures inside your cells interact in lots of really cool
and complex ways. How do they do that? By wiggling around really fast.
Proteins are so small, weigh so little, and exist on such a
fundamentally different scale that they behave very strangely compared
to things on the human giant level. Gravity is not a relevant force for
things at this scale. And so, at room temperature, an average protein
can move about sixteen feet (five meters) per second, in theory. Maybe
that does not sound fast, until you remember that the average protein is
about one million times smaller than the tip of your finger. If you
could run as fast as a protein in your world, you would be as fast as a
jet plane and die horrifically by crashing into something.</p>
<p>In practice, proteins can’t actually move that fast inside cells,
because there are so many other molecules in the way. So they constantly
collide and bump into the water molecules and other proteins in all
directions. Everybody is pushing around and is getting pushed. This
process is called Brownian motion and it describes the random movement
of molecules in a gas or fluid. Which is the reason water is so
important for your cells—because it enables other molecules to move
around easily. Despite, or maybe even because of the chaos of random
movements in combination with the speed of your protein puzzle pieces,
things get done in cells.*4</p>
<p>Let’s try to simplify a little. To imagine the basic principle cells
use to bring things together, a good metaphor is a sandwich. If you were
inside a cell and you wanted to make a jelly sandwich, the best approach
would be to throw the toast and jelly into the air and wait a few
seconds. Because of how fast everything is smashing together, they will
come together all by themselves, unifying into a sandwich that you can
just pick from the air.*5</p>
<p>In the microworld, the different shapes of a molecule determine which
molecules attract and repel each other. And so the shape of your cells’
proteins determines which proteins attract or repel each other and how
they interact (while the number of different types of proteins
determines how often these interactions happen). This creates the
interactions that make up the biochemistry of all cells on earth. These
interactions are fundamentally important for biology and are called
biological pathways. Pathways are fancy words to describe a series of
interactions between individual things that lead to a change in a cell.
This can mean the assembly of new special proteins or other molecules,
which can turn genes on and off, which changes what the cell can and
can’t do. Or it can spur a cell into action and cause the cell to do
things we would call behavior, like reacting to a danger by moving
away.</p>
<p>OK. That was a lot of information in the last few pages. And we
aren’t quite out of the cell yet, but almost! Let’s summarize quickly
what we learned:</p>
<p>Cells are filled up by proteins. Proteins are three-dimensional
puzzle pieces. Their specific shapes enable them to fit together or
interact with other proteins in specific ways. Sequences of these
interactions, called pathways, cause cells to do things. This is what we
mean when we say that cells are protein robots guided by biochemistry.
The complex interactions between dumb and dead proteins create a less
dumb and less dead cell, and the complex interactions between slightly
dumb cells create the pretty smart immune system.</p>
<p>As is the case with most of this stuff, we stumbled into a big topic
here and there are countless rabbit holes to fall into. In this case, we
stumbled into how and why many mindless things can create something that
is smarter than the sum of its parts. This is typically not discussed
when the immune system is explained, but it might be worth spending a
minute on it before we move on, because it adds another layer of wonder
to the immune system and your cells in general that we never really
think about when we have to sit out a flu or watch a wound heal.</p>
<p>But because this all gets abstract quickly, we need another analogy,
so let us talk about ants for a hot second. Ants share a few properties
with cells, most importantly: they are really dumb. This is not to be
mean to ants. If you take a single ant and isolate it, it will just
stumble around and be really useless, unable to do anything of value.
But if you put a lot of ants together, they can exchange information and
interact with each other and in unison do amazing things. Many ants
construct complex structures with specialized areas like brood chambers,
dedicated garbage places, or complex ventilation systems that control
airflow. Ants automatically organize themselves into different classes
and jobs, from foraging to defending or nursing. Not just randomly, but
in proportions that are the most useful for the survival of the
collective. If one of these different classes is decimated, maybe
because of a hungry anteater passing by, some of the remaining ants will
switch their job to restore the correct job ratio again. And they do all
of these things despite being really dumb individually. But together,
they become something greater and are able to do legitimately
astonishing things that they could not do alone. This phenomenon occurs
all over nature, and is called emergence. It is the observation that
entities have properties and abilities that their parts do not have. So
an ant colony as an entity can do complex things, while the individual
ant can’t.</p>
<p>This is sort of how everything in your body works. Your cells are
nothing but bags of proteins guided by chemistry. But together these
proteins form a living being that can do a lot of really sophisticated
things. Still, our cells remain mindless robots that are, individually,
even dumber than ants. But many of them acting together can do things
the individuals can’t do. Like forming specialized tissue and organ
systems, from muscles that make your heart beat to brain cells that make
you think and read this sentence. And many stupid parts and cells
together form your immune system—through complex interactions that turn
out to create something really smart.</p>
<p>OK, we have to move on. But from this diversion you hopefully
gathered the following things: Cells are the wonderfully complex
machines of life. They are mostly made from and filled with puzzle
pieces made from a stunningly diverse number of proteins, and entirely
run by biochemistry. Somehow all of this together creates a living thing
that can sense and interact with its environment. Cells do their jobs
without emotion or purpose. But they do them very well and for that they
deserve our gratitude and a little bit of attention. In the following
chapters we will anthropomorphize our tiny robot cells from time to
time.</p>
<p>We will speak about what they want and are trying to achieve, their
thoughts, hopes, and dreams. Which gives them a little bit of character
and makes it easier to explain certain things, even if it is not true.
As amazing as your cells are, please remember: Cells don’t want
anything. Cells don’t feel anything. They are never sad or happy. They
just are, right here, right now. They are as conscious as a stone or a
chair or a neutron star. Cell robots follow their code that has been
evolving and changing for billions of years and has turned out pretty
great if you are able to sit down comfortably and read this book right
now. Still, seeing them as little buddies might lead to us treating them
with more respect and understanding and will make this book much more
fun to read, which seems like a good enough excuse to do so.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask yourself: If we have this huge continent of flesh
that is populated by billions of robots that are collectively smart
while being, on an individual scale, internally complex yet pretty
stupid—how on earth do they defend your body?</p>
<p>Well…</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 If you are reading this outside, well, that is unfortunate for the
metaphor, isn’t it? So please pretend you are somewhere inside.</p>
<p>*2 You may ask yourself why that is. Well, we could spend a lot of
time talking about this and it is actually quite fascinating but also
opening a whole new can of worms. So let us just say that it matters how
big you are. While for you on the human scale water is this uniform
substance, if you were the size of a protein, a single water molecule is
pretty big, like an actual thing that bumps into you. So you would find
it much harder to swim through water too.</p>
<p>*3 Some of you will do the math now and get even crazier numbers.
Forty trillion cells times two meters is roughly 80,000,000,000,000
meters, which is actually five times the distance to Pluto and back to
Earth. But there is a minor catch we didn’t mention in the intro about
the body: The vast majority of your cells actually do not have DNA. Red
blood cells in particular make up around 80% of your cells by pure
numbers, and they don’t have a nucleus, because they are filled head to
toe with iron molecules that transport oxygen. So you will have to
settle for going to Pluto and coming back just once.</p>
<p>*4 This is not to say that our complex human cells are completely
reliant on randomness. Cells have a lot of complex and wonderful
mechanisms to get things exactly where they need them to be, and that
we’ll ignore here. If you do care: There are transport proteins that
move along the scaffolding of cells. The best thing about them is that
they look like gigantic, ridiculous feet that jump forward by magic and
if you have a moment to get distracted, you should look at videos of
them on YouTube.</p>
<p>*5 In reality it is more like throwing thousands of toasts and
thousands of pots of jelly into the air. Your cells have no use for a
single jelly sandwich but need large amounts of everything to make
things work out.</p>
