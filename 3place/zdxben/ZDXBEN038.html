<h4 id="an-aside-smoking-and-the-immune-system">An Aside Smoking and the
Immune System</h4>
<p>While air pollution is a thing and responsible for up to five million
deaths per year, none of the things you can breathe in by strolling
through a city compares even mildly to what you get by smoking a single
cigarette. While you might know that smoking is incredibly bad for you
because “something-something cancer,” there is more! It turns out
smoking is bad in many different ways that are closely related to the
immune system. In a nutshell, you break the mechanisms that protect you
against disease and cancer, while making it more likely to get an
infection or cancerous cells!</p>
<p>Cigarette smoke is saturated with over 4,000 different chemicals,
many of them with unknown properties and interactions with each other.
But we know for sure that nicotine, the magic and vile substance that
makes smoking addictive, suppresses your immune system. It makes your
immune cells slow and ineffective. The major place where this happens is
the respiratory system, especially in the lungs—which should be no
surprise because this is where all the smoke goes. What does nicotine do
exactly?</p>
<p>First of all, it affects your Alveolar Macrophages we met briefly
before. They are basically just Macrophages that are more chill and
patrol the surface of your lungs to pick up trash and the occasional
pathogen. In the lungs of smokers there are way, way more of these
special Macrophages than in nonsmoking people. Which makes sense,
because cigarette smoke comes with all sorts of microparticles and
charming stuff like tar that need to be cleaned up constantly. But
because of the constant exposure to nicotine, these already toned-down
Macrophages are toned down even more. No longer just chill but basically
constantly tired and sluggish.</p>
<p>They are less able to call for support and reinforcements and they
have a much harder time killing enemies. On top of that, these poor
dysfunctional Macrophages are also accidentally damaging your lungs by
periodically vomiting out chemicals that dissolve your lung tissue.</p>
<p>Given enough time these Macrophages high on nicotine can destroy
large amounts of the functional tissue of the lung, creating wounds that
turn into scar tissue. If this is not clear from the context: Scar
tissue in your lungs is bad if you like breathing. Wounds in the lungs
also come with the unfortunate side effect of inflammation, which
activates more immune cells, which then causes further damage.</p>
<p>Another crucial cell that becomes seriously toned down and less
active through smoking are your Natural Killer Cells, which as we
learned before are one of your main countermeasures against young cancer
cells. It is thought that this plays a relevant role in the considerably
higher incidence of lung cancer in smokers. Which makes sense—on the one
hand you saturate your lungs with cancerous poison and a drug that makes
your immune system cause wounds in your lungs, and on the other hand you
make the cells tasked to kill cancer less able to do so effectively.</p>
<p>What about the adaptive immune system? Although regular smokers have
many more immune cells in their blood overall, they seem to be less
effective. T Cells have a much harder time proliferating after they have
been activated and their behavior is also more sluggish. Antibodies in
general seem to decay much faster in the bodily fluids of smokers so the
overall effectiveness of the adaptive immune system is greatly reduced,
which explains why infections like the flu are much more deadly for
smokers.</p>
<p>Although there is an exception: Autoantibodies, a kind of antibody
that can cause certain autoimmune diseases, are greatly increased. In a
nutshell, if you smoke, your immune system does way more of the stuff
that is bad and damaging for the body and at the same time it is worse
at actually fighting your enemies, calling reinforcements, and stopping
invaders from spreading. As a bonus consequence smokers have a harder
time healing wounds because of their suppressed immune system not being
able to help with healing as much as it should. Even if you stop smoking
today, your immune system will stay suppressed for a week to months—so
the earlier you quit the better.</p>
<p>But it would be dishonest to say that there are not a few positive
effects of smoking because the world is not binary: Sometimes having a
toned-down immune system can be a good thing. Inflammation is a
double-edged sword, indispensable for your survival, but also very
harmful to you.</p>
<p>Smokers suffer less often from inflammatory diseases simply because
inflammation is regulated down if your immune system is behaving like a
slug that ate a few hash brownies for breakfast. So in the case of
certain inflammatory autoimmune diseases, like ulcerative colitis for
example, smoking seems to offer some form of protection.</p>
<p>Don’t use this fact as an argument in your next discussion with your
mom why you should totally continue to smoke though: All in all, while
smoking offers some protection against some diseases, it also makes you
much more susceptible to many, many more others. The slight upsides are
not worth the massive downsides. This would be a great place for an
analogy about how stupid it would be to smoke to avoid certain diseases
but actually, maybe this is already the analogy. Smoking to have a
slightly better chance to avoid inflammatory diseases would be really
stupid.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>There is this myth that your attitude is crucial when it comes to
surviving cancer. The general idea is that if you have and display a
positive attitude, you will activate some mystical force in the immune
system and enable it to overcome the disease. Inversely, a really
negative attitude may have the opposite effect and make it harder for
your body to beat the disease or may even have caused it. Wherever the
idea of your attitude affecting your cancer survival chances originally
comes from, after decades of research it has become clear that with an
extremely high certainty, your attitude has no effect on your chances of
surviving cancer. Your immune system does not magically become better or
worse at fighting cancer if you are or are not positive and happy.
Still, this myth is going strong, as it appeals to our culture of
self-empowerment and agency and is spread by many well-meaning
people.</li>
</ul>
<p>But aside from the fact that there is no solid science to prove a
relationship, it is a terrible thing to say to someone with cancer that
their attitude matters and that they should stay positive, because it
does two things:</p>
<p>For one, it puts the responsibility of healing and surviving on the
sick person. It implies that if you don’t win the fight and have faced
the gravest of all outcomes, it is your fault. That if you just had been
more positive and optimistic, no matter how you really felt, that you
could have saved yourself. Which is an incredibly unfair burden to put
on someone who is fighting this disease.</p>
<p>The other reason is chemotherapy, surgeries, and radiation therapy
are, well, not a great experience. And by being told that you are
supposed to be positive to get well, you are told that you are not
allowed to feel how you feel. But expressing how unwell you are and
asking for an open ear or love is important because it can help you deal
with very strong negative emotions caused by fear and very unpleasant
treatments that you have to endure. Being more positive and having a
good attitude towards life and its challenges makes your life better. It
does so no matter if you are sick or not—if you have more good and
optimistic feelings, you feel better. It can reduce stress, which in
turn might reduce the negative influence to your immune defenses. So a
positive attitude when you are sick is a good thing. Studies have shown
that a positive attitude during cancer treatment is good for your own
mental well-being. It can make the experience much less worse. And less
worse is a very good thing during chemotherapy.</p>
