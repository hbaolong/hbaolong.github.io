<h4 id="the-coronavirus-pandemic">45 The Coronavirus Pandemic</h4>
<p>The immune system has always been relevant to our collective health
and well-being but as soon as you are at least semi-healthy, it is also
pretty easy to ignore that side of life. But this all ended when
suddenly a disease thing interrupted public and private life in a way
that most people had never thought possible. A lot of terms and ideas
from immunology were suddenly talked about regularly.</p>
<p>At the time this book was written the coronavirus pandemic was still
raging, and there were a lot of open questions. A massive amount of
research is being conducted around the world by countless scientists and
we will learn a lot more in the coming years. In a way this is the best
and the worst time to write a book about the immune system—the best time
because more people might be interested in understanding what the hell
is going on inside their bodies and how the body handles diseases. But
the worst time because it would be so nice to write a comprehensive
explanation of COVID-19, which is presently just impossible to do as
there is still so much science going on.</p>
<p>But I think it still makes sense to talk a bit about it anyways.
Luckily, all in all, immunologists have a solid grasp of the
fundamentals of the coronavirus and what it does to us already. But
first of all let us define what we are talking about.</p>
<p>Soon after the start of the pandemic, the virus, which has the
horrible official name Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2,
was just called “coronavirus” by the public. Which is unfortunate and
sort of wrong as coronaviruses are just a group of viruses, not a single
species. But because of the rapid spread of the pandemic we missed our
window to give this particular species of coronavirus a good, unique
name. And while I complain a lot about scientists and the names they
chose for things in this book, this time I really can’t blame them as
they were understandably pretty busy. When stressful things happen
quickly we settle for whatever works at the time and that is OK.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of different coronavirus species, and they do a
lot of different things. Mostly they infect the respiratory system of
mammals, like bats and unfortunately humans.</p>
<p>Humans in particular are affected by a number of different
coronaviruses. For example, around 15% of the cases of the common cold
are caused by a coronavirus species. Coronaviruses have been around us
for a long time, and many of the people reading this sentence already
have antibodies against some of them flowing through their blood.</p>
<p>There were even dangerous coronavirus pandemics in the last few
decades that you may even have heard about, like the SARS coronavirus
(SARS is an abbreviation for “severe acute respiratory syndrome”). It is
a respiratory disease caused by a coronavirus strain that also was found
in bats in China in the early 2000s. It infected a few thousand, and
killed a few hundred people, having a mortality rate close to 19%, which
is pretty harsh.</p>
<p>A few years later, there was a second serious coronavirus outbreak.
This time it originated in the Middle East and was called MERS, short
for “Middle East respiratory syndrome.” This one was even deadlier than
SARS, and although it infected only around 2,500 people, it killed more
than a third of them, with a horrible mortality rate of 34%. Both of
these coronavirus species never got off the ground enough to become a
real worldwide pandemic, which, if we look at their death rates, is
something we can be truly grateful for.</p>
<p>Our collective coronavirus-related luck ran out at the end of 2019,
when another coronavirus emerged. It is wildly more infectious than its
predecessors but also far less deadly. Thanks to SARS and MERS,
scientists had plenty of time to learn a lot about the mechanisms of
dangerous coronavirus infections before the worldwide pandemic
began.</p>
<p>Now, it is impossible to just describe with absolute certainty what
happens during COVID-19, because it depends in large part on the
patient. It has been widely reported that most people get no or only
mild symptoms from an infection, while a minority has serious symptoms,
often requiring hospitalization, and that an even smaller group dies. In
diseases where symptoms vary that strongly from person to person, the
reason is usually found within the individual’s immune system and how it
handles the infection. On top of that, the development of COVID-19
infections is pretty complex and new things are still being learned
constantly. All of this makes COVID-19 hard to explain in detail, at
least if this chapter wants to remain valid for a while. So we will
stick with what we know, or, at most, what scientists are pretty
confident about.</p>
<p>Some people infected by the coronavirus develop no symptoms at all,
although they still seem to transmit the virus to others. Up to 80% of
patients develop a mild disease, which still means pretty unpleasant
symptoms for many. Mild, in this context, really only means that you
don’t require hospitalization. One of the first signs of an infection is
often the loss of smell and sometimes even the sense of taste—which is a
much bigger deal for the quality of life than most people realize until
it hits them. In most people, the sense of taste and smell begins to
return after some weeks. Although the virus has not been around long
enough for us to know how long this sensory recovery will take.</p>
<p>Aside from that, most milder cases experience what could be called
flulike symptoms like fever, coughing, a sore throat, headache and body
aches, and a general sense of exhaustion. A constant state of
exhaustion, problems with concentration, and a reduced lung capacity
also are symptoms that do not recede in some people, even months after
they were infected.</p>
<p>But there remain a lot of open questions, especially about the
long-term consequences for the people who experience them. At this point
we simply don’t know yet if the coronavirus pandemic will cause
irreversible damage or not. In the cases of the more deadly SARS and
MERS outbreaks, it took at least five years for the physical changes in
patients’ lungs to return to normal. What exactly does the coronavirus
do and why is it so deadly to some?</p>
<p>The coronavirus targets a specific and very important receptor called
ACE2. This receptor has a few vital jobs in your body, specifically
regulating your blood pressure, which means you have a lot of cells in
your body that carry it and can be infected. If you guessed that the
epithelial cells in your nose and lungs have plenty of this receptor,
you’d be right. From the perspective of a coronavirus, your lungs are
miles and miles of free real estate.</p>
<p>But the ACE2 receptor also sits on cells in a variety of tissues and
organs around your body. Your blood vessels and capillaries, your heart,
your gut, and your kidneys. All of them have ACE2. As we learned before,
your body’s first response to a viral infection is chemical warfare,
which basically does three main things: Interferons interfere with virus
reproduction and slow it down, while other cytokines cause inflammation
and alert immune cells.</p>
<p>Now, one thing that makes the coronavirus so dangerous is that it
seems to be able to shut down (or strongly delay) the release of
interferons, while the infected cells still release all the cytokines
that cause inflammation and alert the immune system. So the virus is
able to infect a lot of cells and spread quickly without being slowed
down, while at the same time triggering widespread inflammation and
activating immune cells that will themselves cause even more
inflammation.*1</p>
<p>And here is where things get dangerous for many people. The massive
amounts of inflammation and active immune cells can cause serious damage
to your lungs—if you remember, this is a region where your immune system
usually tries to tread lightly because the tissue here is pretty
sensitive. Without the interferon the virus still multiplies with very
little resistance, while the inflammation is already causing damage.</p>
<p>As millions of epithelial cells die, now suddenly, the lungs’
protective lining is gone and your alveoli, the tiny air sacs that do
the actual breathing by exchanging gases between your insides and
outsides, lie bare and can be damaged or even killed in the ongoing
battle that ensues.</p>
<p>If it gets to this point, many critical patients will likely need to
be mechanically ventilated, which is a fancy way of saying “sticking a
tube into the lungs,” and of course is a great way for bacteria to get a
shortcut deep into your lungs where they find a pretty stressed-out
immune system and a lot of tissue waiting to be colonized. This can get
dramatic very quickly. If you are really unlucky you could also get a
co-infection with more serious bacteria that can’t believe their luck
and enter the environment deep inside your lungs. As the bacteria
multiply the immune system has to react to the new threat and sends in
the troops, more Macrophages and Neutrophils that do their job: Vomiting
acid and causing more inflammation and damage.</p>
<p>Do you see the horrible pattern that emerges here? Stimulation causes
activation, which causes more stimulation, which causes more activation,
and so on. A horribly dangerously devious cycle with often deadly
consequences. The massive amount of inflammation in the lungs can rip
literal holes in the tissue and cause irreversible damage and scar
tissue where your body hastily tries to heal. Even after surviving, many
people may have a reduced lung capacity for the rest of their lives,
which means trouble breathing and a reduced ability for physical
activities.</p>
<p>In this context many people might also have heard about cytokine
storms for the first time, which means a massive overreaction and
overstimulation with all the signals your immune system is usually very
careful to use just in the perfect amounts.</p>
<p>And we are still not done with the infection. And so there is even
more bad news at this point: another critical body system can be
affected by the typhoon of chemical screaming and overstimulation that
is going on. In many serious COVID-19 cases, a coagulation cascade is
triggered that leads to blood clotting, which means that the parts of
your blood responsible for closing a wound can activate and begin to
clot in your fine blood vessels, leading to a lack of oxygen supply in
your organs. The body is now choked for oxygen from the inside while it
also has a harder time breathing as the lungs fill with fluid. And of
course, the clotting can cause a stroke or a heart attack, with all the
known consequences.</p>
<p>For many people who had already been suffering from serious diseases,
this is too much. Diabetes, heart disease, elevated blood pressure, and
obesity are just some of the risk factors.*2</p>
<p>On top of that, many older individuals just have weaker immune
systems that did not have the most impressive interferon response to
begin with, and get overwhelmed much more easily by the coronavirus.
This is the reason why most deaths occur in older individuals and the
ones with preexisting conditions. But make no mistake, plenty of
formerly healthy and young people die too. It is just a matter of bad
luck and how your immune system handles all these challenges.</p>
<p>Let us end this chapter here. As I’m writing this sentence the world
has begun vaccinating against COVID-19 and with a bit of luck, as you
are reading this sentence, we are all returning to a world that feels
normal again. In any case, the coronavirus pandemic was a stark reminder
of why your immune system is so incredibly important and why more people
would benefit from understanding it better.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 A callback to what we learned before. One of the reasons why some
people are able to deal better with the coronavirus than others is the
genetic variability and the difference in MHC molecules or your
toll-like receptors that lead to slightly different immune systems from
person to person. Some immune systems are just better at dealing with
the virus than others. And some are unfortunately really bad at dealing
with it. So if you hear in the media that seemingly young and healthy
people suffer from severe cases of COVID-19 and even die, this is one
aspect of it. We never know what our individual immune system is great
against until it is put to the test.</p>
<p>*2 One of the many reasons obesity is such an unhealthy thing is that
fat tissue produces loads of inflammatory cytokines. So even on a good
day, an obese person has a lot of inflammatory signals in their system.
When infected by the coronavirus for example, their starting point is
already worse, they are already more inflamed than they should be.</p>
