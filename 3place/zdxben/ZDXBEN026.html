<h4 id="how-a-viral-infection-is-eradicated">33 How a Viral Infection Is
Eradicated</h4>
<p>When we left the battlefield the last time things were turning
gruesome. Millions of cells were dying and your innate immune system was
desperately and pretty unsuccessfully trying to rein in the rapidly
spreading infection. Numerous chemical signals were flooding your body,
requesting a change in temperature and making your body burn up with a
high fever, kicking your immune system into a higher gear and making it
fight harder.*1</p>
<p>All sorts of systems began to wake up, producing more mucus and
making you cough violently, removing millions of virus particles from
your body but also making you highly infectious. The onslaught of battle
chemicals, cytokines, and dead or dying cells makes you exhausted and
causes all sorts of unpleasant body sensations.</p>
<p>But all that was just to buy time.</p>
<p>It takes about two to three days until Natural Killer Cells show up
and begin to alleviate your desperately fighting immune soldiers. They
flood the tissue and begin killing infected epithelial cells, especially
the ones that were manipulated by the influenza A virus to hide their
display windows, their MHC class I molecules, but not exclusively them.
The more stressed and desperate infected cells get mercifully finished
off, to end their suffering but also to prevent them from causing
further harm.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Natural Killer Cells is a noticeable relief for
the defense of the battlefield as they are actually causing a real dent
in the number of infected cells. But even these merciless and effective
killers are not enough to end the infection. Even they are basically
just buying time, although much more successfully than the Macrophages,
Monocytes, and Neutrophils.</p>
<p>While this was going on thousands of Dendritic Cells had sampled the
battlefield and picked up viruses, ripping them into pieces that are put
into their MHC class I molecules (and their MHC class II molecules).
They made their way to the lymph nodes and activated Killer T Cells and
Helper T Cells that then went on to activate B Cells and order
Antibodies.</p>
<p>And now, about a week after you collapsed into bed, your heavy
artillery finally arrives.</p>
<p>Killer T Cells flood into your lungs in the thousands, armed with
receptors that recognize influenza A virus antigen, moving from cell to
cell and taking them into a warm embrace, taking a deep look into the
MHC class I windows, listening to the protein story that the cells tell.
If they detect virus antigens they order the infected cells to kill
themselves. Macrophages work overtime to eat up all their dead friends
and foes.</p>
<p>Millions and millions of Antibodies move in to eliminate the viruses
outside of cells and stop them from infecting more cells. Through the
magic of the dance of the B and T cells, a number of different types of
Antibodies were made that attack the virus on different fronts.</p>
<p>Neutralizing Antibodies neutralize the virus by connecting firmly to
the structures that the virus used to gain access into epithelial cells.
Covered by dozens of Antibodies that block the virus from entering
cells, it is now nothing more than a useless and harmless bundle of
genetic code and proteins that will eventually be cleaned up by your
Macrophages.</p>
<p>Other Antibodies can be very specific and block the virus in a
variety of interesting ways. For example, there is a virus protein
called viral neuraminidase that enables new viruses to be released from
an infected cell. As we explained earlier, influenza A viruses bud from
infected cells, taking a bunch of the membrane of their victims with
them. Antibodies can connect to viral neuraminidase during this budding
process and effectively disable it. So you have an infected cell with
lots of new viruses on its surface that are unable to detach and infect
new cells, basically being stuck in place like flies on one of these
sadistic glue traps.</p>
<p>Antibodies and Killer T Cells in concert really do the trick and the
number of viruses in your lungs collapses rapidly. Over the next few
days the combined symphony of your immune system eradicates the majority
of the infection and begins a great cleanup on the battlefield. It seems
like the war is already over, but this is not quite true.</p>
<p>In contrast to our first story in the bacteria section of this book,
we are dealing with a different kind of immune response here. It is more
global, touching way more systems, organs, and tissues, and the
infection is way more dangerous. And while you lie in your bed and feel
horrible, it is important to remember that the symptoms you feel are
mostly created by your own immune system to clear out the infection. If
these countermeasures are used too freely, your immune system can do
immense and terrible damage to you, much worse than even the influenza A
virus could do.</p>
<p>So there is an intense need to downregulate the immune response
again, to have it strike with just the exact amount of vigor, and to
shut it down as soon as it is not needed. To get back to
homeostasis.</p>
