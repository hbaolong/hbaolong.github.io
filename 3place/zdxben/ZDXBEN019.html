<h4 id="the-weird-and-special-immune-system-of-your-gut">25 The Weird
and Special Immune System of Your Gut</h4>
<p>Your intestines are a very special place for your immune system
because a lot of complicated challenges need to be managed here to keep
the body healthy and functioning.</p>
<p>Again imagine your guts as a long tube reaching through you, trapping
a bit of outside inside you. On this outside, on your gut mucosa, around
thirty to forty trillion individual bacteria from around 1,000 different
species and tens of thousands of species of viruses make up your gut
microbiota (the vast majority of viruses in your gut are hunting the
bacteria living there and not interested in you).</p>
<p>There are a lot of things about the interactions and functions of
your Immune System and the gut microbiome we don’t understand yet. We
know that many diseases and disorders are associated with these
interactions being out of balance, but a lot of research needs to be
done before we will be able to fully understand all these relationships.
It is likely that the next few years will reveal a lot of exciting
things.*</p>
<p>In this chapter we’ll explore a little how it is possible that this
coexistence with so many guests is even possible.</p>
<p>So first of all, the immune system of your intestines is a
semi-closed system that tries not to mix too much with the immune system
in the rest of the body. In a sense, it is a bit like Switzerland, which
is surrounded by countries that are part of the European Union. Sure it
is part of Europe, but still does its own thing to a certain degree and
is technically independent. And in a way the swamp kingdom of your gut
is a bit like that, because it needs to do a lot of things
differently.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge it has to contend with is that the defense
perimeters of your intestines are constantly breached. There is a
never-ending stream of attacks and your gut immune system has to
perpetually react and separate friends from foes, more than in any other
place of your body. Because as you can probably imagine, your intestines
are a busy place. Aside from the trillions of organisms that form your
gut microbiome, there is all the stuff that you put inside your
mouth.</p>
<p>Food begins its journey of becoming part of you and your cells by
being ground into pieces by our teeth and being saturated and prepared
by your saliva. Saliva contains a number of chemicals that help break
down your food, so digestion really begins right after you begin eating.
This makes sense, because as food is funneled through you, there is only
a limited time window to extract the resources, so better start as soon
as possible. After the ground-down foodstuffs are swallowed, they get to
have a moment in an ocean of acid in your stomach. Which is not only
helpful for your digestion and helps break down tough meat or fibrous
plants, many microorganisms don’t like being submerged in literal acid
and die here, making the job of your immune system much, much
easier.</p>
<p>After the stomach the journey continues through your intestine, which
is between ten and twenty-three feet long and constitutes the longest
stretch of our digestive tract. Over 90% of the nutrients you need to
survive are absorbed here. And here a lot of the bacteria buddies you
need to survive spend their time assisting with breaking down the food
even more and enabling your body to take up its nutrients. But these are
not just any bacteria. Millions of years ago your ancestors made a
fragile deal with a team of microbial species—humans provide them with a
long, warm tunnel to live in and a constant stream of stuff they can
eat, and in turn they break down carbohydrates that we can’t digest and
produce certain vitamins that we can’t make ourselves. The bacteria of
the microbiome are tenants of sorts and these resources are the rent
they have to pay.</p>
<p>These bacteria are called commensal bacteria, which comes from Latin
and means something like “together at the same table.” Like the
barbarian bacteria hordes on the Desert Kingdom of the Skin, commensal
bacteria and you are friends. The deal works best if they don’t harm you
and your immune system doesn’t kill them. So to keep everything nice and
peaceful, the bacteria of your gut live on top of the mucus layer of
your gut, just like bacteria on your skin live on top of your skin. As
long as your gut bacteria respect this separation and don’t try to dive
deeper and get to the epithelial cells, all is good. But of course
things are not that easy.</p>
<p>Bacteria are not actually our friends and they don’t know anything
about any kind of deals and they don’t respect anything. Because of the
sheer vastness of our intestines and their incredible numbers, every
second of your life, a bunch of commensal bacteria wander deeper into
your body. And this is a problem, because if they were to enter the
bloodstream and enter your actual insides, they could do horrible damage
or even kill you. So the mucosa of your intestines is built in a way to
prevent that.</p>
<p>In a nutshell there are three layers: First a layer of mucus filled
with antibodies, defensins (we met these before on the skin, the tiny
needles that can kill microorganisms), and other proteins that kill or
damage bacteria. In the gut it has to be pretty thin and somewhat porous
because all the nutrients from your food need to pass inside, and if the
first protective layer were too good, you would starve to death.</p>
<p>Below the mucus layer, the intestinal epithelial cells are the actual
barrier between the inside and the outside. Similarly to your lungs, the
layer of epithelial cells protecting your insides is only ONE cell
thick. To be a bit better at protecting your insides, the intestinal
epithelial cells are extremely well-connected with each other. Special
proteins glue them together firmly, so they can be as good a wall as
possible. Your immune system monitors this area and is especially
annoyed with any kind of microorganism that is trying to attach itself
to the epithelial cells.</p>
<p>This is actually happening constantly, every second of your life—a
bunch of commensal bacteria passing the defensive wall. So below the
epithelial wall is the third layer of the gut mucosa, the Lamina
Propria, which is the home of most of the immune system of your gut. In
the Lamina Propria, directly below the surface, special Macrophages, B
Cells, and Dendritic Cells are waiting to greet the unwelcome
guests:</p>
<p>Your intestinal immune system really does not want to cause
inflammation if not absolutely necessary, because inflammation means a
lot of extra fluid in the intestines, which you experience as diarrhea.
Diarrhea doesn’t just mean watery poop, but also damage to the very
sensitive and thin layer of the cells that take up the nutrients from
your food. And diarrhea can rapidly dehydrate a patient to dangerous
levels.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to most people, diarrhea is still a huge killer,
responsible for about half a million dead children each year. So
millions of years ago when we evolved, our bodies and immune systems
learned to take inflammation in the intestines very seriously.</p>
<p>As a consequence the Macrophages guarding your intestines have two
properties: Firstly, they are really good at swallowing bacteria. And
secondly, they do not release the cytokines that call in Neutrophils and
cause inflammation. They are more like silent killers, casually eating
bacteria that cross the line but without making a fuss about it.</p>
<p>The Dendritic Cells of your gut behave in a special way too. Many of
them sit directly below the layer of epithelial cells and squeeze their
long arms between them, reaching right into the mucus of the gut. This
way they can constantly sample the bacteria that are cheeky enough to
not stay in their lane but venture too deep.</p>
<p>At this point lies a huge mystery of immunology that promises another
Nobel Prize for the person or team who solve it one day: How do
Dendritic Cells know if the bacteria they sample in the gut are
dangerous pathogens or just harmless commensal bacteria? Well, right now
we don’t know but we know that when Dendritic Cells sample commensals,
they order the local immune system to chill out and not be too annoyed
by their antigens.</p>
<p>And there is more. Around your gut, special types of B Cells produce
nothing but large amounts of IgA Antibodies, the Antibody that works
especially well in mucus.</p>
<p>IgA Antibodies are specifically made for this kind of environment—for
one they can be passed right through the barrier of epithelial cells and
saturate the mucosa of the gut.</p>
<p>And IgA does not activate the complement system and does not trigger
inflammation, which are both very important here. IgA is really good at
something else though: with its four pincers that reach in opposite
directions, it is an expert at grabbing two different bacteria and
clumping them together.</p>
<p>So a lot of IgA can create huge clumps of helpless bacteria that are
transported out of the body as part of your poop. All in all, around 30%
of your poop consists of bacteria—and a lot of them have been clumped up
by IgA Antibodies (most disturbingly, around 50% of them are still alive
when they leave you). Your gut immune system quietly makes sure the
visitors on your inside and outside are kept in check. So with these
mechanisms and special cells, your immune system keeps the mucus free of
overly ambitious friendly bacteria but also makes sure that it does not
cause damage by overreacting. Your gut immune system really is a
peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>All of these mechanisms are a horrible idea though if there are real
invaders, like pathogenic bacteria that somehow could survive the brutal
acid ocean of the stomach and reach the intestines intact. To catch
these serious enemies as early as possible, your gut has a type of
special lymph node called Peyer’s patches that are directly integrated
into your intestines. Microfold Cells (the same cells that we briefly
met in your tonsils) reach directly into the intestines and take samples
of things they think might be interesting for the immune system to take
a look at. In a way, they are a sort of elevator cell that picks up
passengers and transfers them directly into the Peyer’s patch, where
adaptive immune cells check out everything that goes on in your gut.
This way your intestines have a superfast immune screening that
constantly monitors the population of bacteria in your gut mucosa very
closely.</p>
<p>OK, enough of bacteria and how they interact with your body. It is
time to meet one of the most common invaders that you have to deal with
in your life. An enemy that does not just invade the body but goes one
step further and directly infects the cells themselves, where it can
stay hidden from immune cells, to do its dirty work. This is such a
smart and dangerous strategy that your immune system had to develop
completely different strategies and weapons.</p>
<p>So let’s explore your (arguably) most sinister enemy, the virus.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the footnote about poop transplants and the time during
World War II where German soldiers ate camel poop. So it is known that
your gut microbiome and how healthy it is has a strong association with
how healthy you are and what you can handle. So in the last few years
the so-called poop transplant has become a thing in modern medicine.
Which means what you think it means—poop from a healthy person, which
carries a healthy dose of their gut microbiome, is administered via a
special pill to a patient. (Or, if you have to know, via a long tube
that drips down the poop from the back of your throat into your
stomach.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not entirely without risks but, for example, it is very
effective in fighting Clostridium difficile infections, which is a nasty
bacteria that are ubiquitous in nature and can also live in small
numbers in your gut. In certain cases, like when a patient has to take
large doses of antibiotics that kill a lot of the bacteria of your gut,
it can take over and become a pathogen that can cause everything from
diarrhea, vomiting, or in the worst cases life-threatening chronic
inflammation of your gut. They are very resistant and sturdy bacteria
and today many strains have become resistant to many antibiotics, which
can make it very hard to get rid of them. One of the things making it
possible for Clostridium difficile to become a problem in the first
place is a weakened natural gut microbiome. Poop transplants have been
shown to have a high chance of restoring the natural balance and help
the patients to get rid of the invaders on their own.</p>
<p>This is basically the idea behind poop transplants but it is not
really a new idea. There is evidence that thousands of years ago eating
the feces of animals was used to treat stomach and gut-related problems
and diseases. Which brings us to World War II and the failed conquest of
North Africa by the German army. Among problems like land mines and,
well, losing, a huge problem the German troops faced was dysentery, a
chronic inflammation that causes horrible cramps and dizziness,
diarrhea, and dehydration (of all the places, the desert is not the
place to lose a lot of water) and can be deadly.</p>
<p>The problem was simply that the soldiers were not used to some of the
local microbes and since this was a time before antibiotics they had
little recourse. A medical science unit that was sent to find a way to
help the suffering men out discovered something peculiar though. Locals
who got sick did not die of dysentery but instead collected the poop of
camels and ate it. And to the utter astonishment of the observers,
usually within a day, the sickness disappeared.</p>
<p>The locals had no idea why it worked, just that it did and that it
had been done for generations. So the German doctors examined the camel
poo and found Bacillus subtilis, a bacteria that suppressed other
bacteria, among them the kinds that caused the dysentery. They cultured
these bacteria in large amounts and administered them to the sick and
dying troops, alleviating the problems of the German army somewhat.
While this was a great moment for science, it did not stop the North
Africa campaign from being a huge failure though.</p>
