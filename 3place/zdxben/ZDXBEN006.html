<h4 id="meet-your-enemies">5 Meet Your Enemies</h4>
<p>To understand your defenses, it is critically important to understand
who is attacking you. As we said before, to most living things you are
not a person but a landscape covered by forests, swamps, and oceans
filled with rich resources and plenty of space to start a family and
settle down. You are a planet, a home.</p>
<p>Most of the microorganisms that accidentally enter your body are
dealt with rather quickly as they are simply not prepared for the body’s
harsh defense measures. So the majority of the living things surrounding
you are just mildly annoying to your immune system.</p>
<p>Your true enemies are an elite group that has found ways to overcome
your defenses more effectively. Some even specialize in hunting humans,
or are using you as a crucial part of their life cycle—enemies like the
measles virus, for example, that have decided to be super annoying to
us. Or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which may have co-evolved with us as
far back as 70,000 years ago and still kills about two million people
each year. Others, like the novel coronavirus that causes the disease
COVID-19, stumble onto us by accident and can’t believe their luck.</p>
<p>In today’s modern world when we are thinking of things that make us
sick, we are mostly talking about bacteria and viruses. Although, in
developing countries, protozoa, single-celled “animals” that cause
diseases like malaria, which kills up to half a million people each
year, are still a serious problem.</p>
<p>Any sort of invader that is able to give your immune system a run for
its money is called a Pathogen—which appropriately means “the maker of
suffering.” So every microorganism that causes disease is a pathogen, no
matter what species, no matter how big or small. And almost everything
can become a pathogen under the right circumstances. For example, a
regular old bacteria living on your skin might not bother you at all,
but can become a pathogen if you are going through chemotherapy and are
immunocompromised, making it easy to invade you. So whenever you read
“pathogen,” just remember it means “a thing that makes you sick.”</p>
<p>Your immune system is “aware” that there are very different kinds of
pathogens, that all require very different responses to get rid of them.
Consequently it has evolved many different weapon systems and responses
against any type of invader. Discussing them all at once would be a bit
much and make the already complex immune system even harder to
understand. So for simplicity’s sake, we will explain your complex
defense mechanisms with the aid of your enemies. One at a time and one
after another. Later on you’ll get to know a few specific diseases and
how they make your life miserable, and lastly we will look at internal
dangers, such as cancer, allergies, and autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>In part 2 of this book we will deal with some of the well-known
microorganisms your immune system has to deal with: Bacteria. Bacteria
are among the oldest living things on this planet and have been partying
for billions of years. They are the smallest things we can consider
alive without getting a headache. If, as we imagined earlier, a cell
were the size of a human, the average bacteria would be the size of a
bunny. Just like your own cells, bacteria are single-celled protein
robots that come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and are guided by
chemistry and their genetic code. A common misconception about them is
to think of them as primitive simply because they are smaller and less
complex than our own cells.</p>
<p>But bacteria have been evolving for a long time and are exactly as
complex as they need to be. And they are super successful on Earth!
Bacteria are masters of survival and can be found basically everywhere
where nutrients are found. And where none can be found, they sometimes
just start making their own by finding ways to eat radiation or other
formerly indigestible things. Bacteria saturate the soil you walk on,
the surface of your desk, they float around in the air. They are on the
page of the book you are reading right now. Some colonize the most
hostile environments, like hydrothermal vents thousands of feet under
the surface of the ocean, while others take on more pleasant places,
like your eyelids.</p>
<p>There has been some controversy about how large the combined biomass
of all bacteria on earth is, but according to even the most conservative
estimate, bacteria have at least ten times more mass than all animals
combined. In one gram of soil, there are up to fifty million bacteria
doing their thing. In one gram of the plaque on your teeth, more
bacteria are living their life than there are humans on planet Earth
right now (if you need a motivating story for your kids why they should
brush their teeth and also give them nightmares, there you go).</p>
<p>In a pleasant environment, a single bacterium can reproduce once
every twenty to thirty minutes by dividing into two bacteria. So after
four more hours of dividing, there would already be 8,000 of them. A few
more hours and there would be millions. And in a few more days, there
would be enough bacteria to fill up the entirety of the world’s oceans.
Luckily this math does not quite work in reality because there is
neither the space nor the nutrients. And not all species of bacteria can
replicate this quickly, but this is what would technically be
possible.</p>
<p>The point being, their potentially superfast reproductive cycle is a
huge challenge for your immune system to deal with. Since they are so
omnipresent on this planet, you are positively, absolutely covered by
bacteria at all times, and have not even the slightest chance of ever
getting rid of them. So our bodies had to arrange with this fact of life
and make the best of it. A life without bacteria is impossible. And
indeed, most bacteria are not only harmless to us, but our ancestors
made a pretty good deal with them that is actually even beneficial to
us. Trillions of them act as friendly neighbors and partners in crime
and help you survive by keeping unfriendly bacteria away and breaking
down certain food parts for you, and in return, they get a place to call
home and free food. But these are not the bacteria we are concerned
about in this book.</p>
<p>There are a lot of unfriendly, pathogenic bacteria that try to invade
your body and make you sick. They cause a wide and scary variety of
diseases, from diarrhea and all sorts of gut unpleasantries to
tuberculosis or pneumonia or really scary things like the black plague,
leprosy, or syphilis. If they get the chance, they also use any
opportunity to infect your flesh when you injure yourself and get your
insides in touch with the environment, where they exist just everywhere.
Before the onset of antibiotics, even small wounds could lead to serious
disease or even death.*</p>
<p>Even today with all the magic of modern medicine, bacterial
infections are responsible for a good chunk of deaths each year. In
other words, they are the perfect starting point to get to know your
immune system! Let us see what happens when a few bacteria successfully
make it into your body! But to get there, they first need to overcome a
mighty barrier: The Desert Kingdom of the Skin.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Let us give this throwaway line a bit more weight and remind all of
us that our grandparents in fact did have it harder in life. We have
data from a Boston hospital from 1941 that shows that 82% of bacterial
infections of the blood resulted in death. We can barely imagine the
horror this number represents—a scratch and a tiny bit of dirt literally
could mean that your life was about to end. Today in developed countries
less than 1% of these kinds of infections are deadly. The fact that we
don’t really think about this stuff too much shows how fast humans
forget and move on, and how happy we can be to live in the present and
not in the past.</li>
