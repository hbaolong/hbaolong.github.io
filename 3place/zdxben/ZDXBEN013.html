<h4 id="the-largest-library-in-the-universe">16 The Largest Library in
the Universe</h4>
<p>It was no coincidence that when the Adaptive Immune System showed up,
the desperate battle turned into a brutal bloodbath that devastated the
invading bacteria. They never had a chance because the reinforcing cells
and Antibodies were born to fight them specifically. Right now your
Adaptive Immune System has a specific weapon against every possible
enemy in the universe. For every single infection that has ever existed
in the past, for all of them in the world right now, and for every
single one that might emerge in the future but does not even exist yet.
In a way, the largest library in the universe.</p>
<p>Wait. What? How? And why? Well, because it is necessary.</p>
<p>Microorganisms have a huge advantage over us meat giants. Consider
how much effort it takes you to make even a single copy of yourself and
your trillions of cells. To multiply you first need to find another
flesh giant that thinks you are cute. Then you need to go through a
complicated dance that hopefully leads to the merger of two cells from
you two.</p>
<p>And then you need to wait for months and months while the merged cell
multiplies over and over and over, until it has become a few trillion
cells and is released into the world as a hopefully healthy human. And
even then you only have produced a single mini human that is actually
pretty weak and needs years of attention and care before it stops being
totally useless. It takes even more years before the offspring can
repeat the dance and multiply again. Any sort of evolutionary adaptation
to a new problem is super slow with our very inefficient ways.</p>
<p>A bacterium consists of one cell. And it can produce another fully
grown-up bacterium in about half an hour. Not only does this mean that
bacteria can multiply orders of magnitude faster, they also change
orders of magnitudes quicker than you can. For a bacterium you are not a
person but a hostile ecosystem applying selective pressure. Your immune
system can exterminate thousands and millions of them, but by pure
random chance from time to time, there will be an individual that adapts
to your defenses and becomes a pathogen: A microorganism that causes
disease, as we saw in our battle. Worse still, even in the midst of an
ongoing infection, the genetic code of invaders can change in ways that
make them harder to kill. Bacteria are a lot of things but they are not
weak—the most dangerous ones have evolved ingenious ways to avoid our
defenses over the years, and, given the chance, they will improve them
even more. So against the powerful enemies from the world of
microorganisms, you, as a huge mountain of cells simply can’t rely on
your innate defenses alone.</p>
<p>And so, to survive these ever-changing enemies that exist in hundreds
of millions of varieties, you need something that can adapt. Something
specific. A weapon for every single different enemy. And weirdly enough,
your immune system has exactly that. But this seems impossible. How can
your slow continent of flesh adapt to create specific defenses for each
of the millions of different microorganisms and the millions more that
don’t even exist yet?</p>
<p>The answer is as simple as it is baffling: The immune system does not
so much adapt to new invaders as it already was adapted when you were
born. It comes preinstalled with hundreds of millions of different
immune cells—a few for every possible threat that you could possibly
encounter in this universe. Right now you have at least one cell inside
you that is a specific weapon against the Black Death, any variant of
the flu, the coronavirus, and the first pathogenic bacteria that will
emerge in a city on Mars in one hundred years. You are ready for every
possible microorganism in this universe.</p>
<p>What you will now learn may be the most amazing aspect of your immune
system. It will take us a few chapters and will introduce not only
mind-blowing principles that keep you alive, but also your best defense
cells and things like Antibodies, something we hear about quite
regularly in the media, especially in the wake of the novel
coronavirus.</p>
