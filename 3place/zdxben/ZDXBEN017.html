<h4 id="antibodies">23 Antibodies</h4>
<p>Antibodies are among the best and most specialized weapons your
immune system has at its disposal. Produced by B Cells, Antibodies
themselves are not particularly deadly. They are actually nothing more
than mindless protein bundles that can stick to antigens. But this they
do with extreme efficiency.</p>
<p>You can imagine them as a sort of hashtag of death. The most common
Antibodies are shaped like little crabs with two pincers and they are
seriously pretty tiny: For an average-sized immune cell, an Antibody is
the size that a grain of quinoa is to you. In a sense they are sort of
comparable to the proteins of the complement system—which are also
nothing more than tiny proteins that float around—but with one huge
difference: Complement proteins are generalists, while Antibodies, as we
just learned, are specific.</p>
<p>This makes it incredibly hard for a pathogen to hide from Antibodies,
since they are made specifically for them. Like a magnet, Antibodies
will seek them out and grab their victim with their tiny pincers. And
once an Antibody has attached itself, it will not let go again. This is
basically what they are: Tiny crab-like proteins that are extremely good
at grabbing on to the enemies they were made for, better than anything
else the body has to offer because as we briefly mentioned before,
Antibodies are B Cell receptors.</p>
<p>What makes them so extremely effective is their anatomy. Every
Antibody has those two pincers, each of them able to grab a specific
antigen extremely firmly. And they have cute little butts that are
extremely good at connecting to your immune cells. The pincers are for
enemies, the cute butts for friends.</p>
<p>With these tools Antibodies do multiple things: First, similar to
complement, they can opsonize enemies. In this context it means that
Antibodies swarm an enemy and grab them, which makes their victim more
delicious for your soldier cells to eat. They grab the pathogen just
like an angry crab that pinches you would because you annoyed it. It
would be very hard for you to live a happy life if you were covered in
wiggling, buzzing tiny crabs that you could never get rid of. Sounds
like right out of a horror movie.</p>
<p>When the Antibody army arrived at our infected toe, the bacteria that
were covered by them were equally unhappy with their life situation and
totally helpless. But Antibodies don’t only make pathogens helpless,
they also can maim them and make them unable to move. Or in the case of
viruses antibodies can directly neutralize them and make them unable to
infect cells.*1</p>
<p>Even worse, because Antibodies have more than one pincer, they can
grab more than one enemy, and if they do, these two are now bound
together. If millions of Antibodies flood a battlefield, they can clump
up large piles of pathogens together that are now even more helpless and
even more unhappy and scared, as a big pile of victims are even easier
to detect for your Macrophages and Neutrophils, who gladly swallow them
whole or shower them in acid. Imagine that—trying to invade an enemy
position and then being bound together with a few dozen of your buddies
by tiny pinching crabs. Unable to move or to act, while an enemy soldier
comes at you with a crazy laugh and a flamethrower.</p>
<p>And similarly to complement proteins, Antibodies also support your
soldiers directly: As you can imagine, bacteria prefer not to be grabbed
and tossed into a bath of acid to die horribly. So they evolved to avoid
the grip of death by Macrophages and Neutrophils. Bacteria are sort of
slippery, like oiled piglets that run around in a panic. Antibodies act
as a special superglue—your immune cells, specifically your phagocytes,
the cells that eat enemies alive, can grab the butts of antibodies very
easily. It is like the difference between trying to open a slippery
glass of pickles with wet or with dry hands.</p>
<p>Here another safety layer of your immune system comes in. The cute
butts of Antibodies that are for friends are in a sort of “hidden mode”
when Antibodies just float around, so immune cells can’t just pick them
up from fluids. As soon as an Antibody has grabbed a victim with its
tiny pincers, its butt changes its shape and is now able to bind to
immune cells. This is pretty important since your body is teeming with
antibodies at any time, and it would cause all sorts of chaos if your
immune cells would bind to the antibody-butts just randomly.</p>
<p>Another thing Antibodies can do with their cute butts is to activate
the complement system. Complement, as efficient and deadly as it is,
when it is only by itself, its abilities are limited and it relies on
finding the surfaces of enemies with a lot of luck basically. Remember,
it just kind of floats passively in the lymph. And some bacteria are
able to hide themselves from the complement system so that it doesn’t
activate close to them. Antibodies are able to activate the complement
system and sort of attract it to bacteria, increasing its efficiency
wildly. Again we see the principle of our two immune systems: The innate
part does the actual fighting, but the adaptive part makes it more
efficient with deadly precision.</p>
<p>Antibodies are not just tiny crabs though. There are multiple classes
that actually do very different things and are used for different
situations. Of course their names are unintuitive and hard to
remember—so we will go through them very briefly. When we mention them
again and their class is important, we will give a short reminder of
what their job was again, so technically you can skip the next part if
you want to get to our next story.</p>
<p>An Aside The Four Classes of Antibodies*2</p>
<p>IgM Antibodies—the First Defenders on Site</p>
<p>IgM Antibodies are usually the majority of Antibodies B Cells produce
when they get activated. They were most likely the first Antibodies to
evolve hundreds of millions of years ago. IgM is basically five
Antibodies merged together at the hips, which has the advantage that
they have five butt regions. Two of these butt regions together can
activate an additional complement pathway. More activated complement
protein means more immune cells drawn to the enemies. Early in an
infection this has the upside that while the adaptive immune system is
still booting up and is not in full combat mode, IgM Antibodies are
already making the innate immune system more deadly and more precise.
Especially against viruses, IgM antibodies are a powerful early weapon
that can slow down an infection. With their ten pincers they can clump
them together easily. So IgM Antibodies are the first Antibodies to be
deployed—which also means that they are the least refined through
mutation and the dance of the B and T Cells. Which is OK since their
most important job is to buy time until better Antibodies are
available.*3</p>
<p>IgG Antibodies—the Specialists</p>
<p>IgG Antibodies come in a few different types. We don’t need to know
them in detail, let us just treat them as different flavor variants of
the same ice cream. The first IgG flavor is a little bit like
complement—it is really good at opsonizing a target and just covering it
like an army of fruit flies, making it harder for a bacteria to do its
thing and to function properly. Its tiny butts are like special glue
that your phagocytes can grab on to easily and devour an enemy with much
less resistance. In general IgG is not nearly as good at activating
complement as IgM is, but it is still pretty solid at it.</p>
<p>Another one of the flavors of IgG is especially useful if an
infection has been going on for a while. If this is the case it is very
likely that a plethora of immune system actors have created plenty of
inflammation already. And as we learned, inflammation, as useful as it
is, is not super great for the health of civilian cells and the body in
general. Especially if an infection is getting chronic. So these special
IgG Antibodies are specifically made to be unable to activate the
complement system late in an infection, which limits inflammation.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes IgG Antibodies special is that they are the
only Antibodies that are able to pass from the blood of a mother into
the blood of an unborn fetus via the placenta.</p>
<p>Not only is this protecting the unborn from a virus infection its
mother may suffer from, it does so way beyond birth. IgG is the Antibody
that takes the longest to decay, so it gives a newborn human a passive
defense against virus infections that protects it in the first few
months until its own immune system has a chance to properly boot up by
itself.</p>
<p>IgA—Making Poop and Protecting Babies</p>
<p>IgA is the most abundant antibody in your body and its main job is to
serve as a cleanup mechanism for your mucosa. Or in other words, it is
in abundance in your respiratory tract, your primary sexual organs, and
especially in your digestive tract, including your mouth. Here, a great
number of special B Cells produce large amounts of these special
antibodies. IgA is basically a sort of bouncer that protects the
entrance doors to your insides, your eyes, nose, mouth, etc. from
unwanted guests, by neutralizing pathogens early on before they have the
chance to get in and establish a foothold.</p>
<p>They are the only antibodies that can freely pass the internal border
of the Mucosa Kingdom from the inside to saturate our mucosa on the
outside. So if you have a nasty cold, your snot is full of IgA giving
viruses and bacteria a hard time.</p>
<p>IgA is different from other antibodies in one major way: IgA have
their little butts merged together, which means that IgA can’t activate
the complement system at all. This is no accident: An activated
complement system means inflammation. And since IgA Antibodies are
constantly produced in your gut, if they could activate complement this
would mean that your gut would be constantly inflamed. Which would cause
disease and diarrhea and make you very unhappy. Diseases that cause
constant inflammation in the gut region, like Crohn’s disease, for
example, are no joke and can seriously impede the happiness and
well-being of a patient suffering from it.</p>
<p>One of the things IgA is great at is attacking multiple targets and
clumping them together in chunks of really unhappy bacteria that are
then swept away by snot, mucus, or your feces. Up to a third of your
feces are actually bacteria unlucky enough to get caught up by the poo
on its way out. Once they are on board, there is no way to get out
again. Other than protecting and cleaning up your gut, IgA also protects
our babies. When mothers are breastfeeding they provide their offspring
with a large amount of IgA Antibodies through their breast milk. These
antibodies then cover the gut of the newborn and protect its
still-fragile intestinal tract from infections.</p>
<p>IgE Antibodies—Thanks, I Hate It</p>
<p>IgE Antibodies don’t look that special, to be honest, but you can
imagine them as giving you the finger with their two little pincers if
you want. If you ever had the very unpleasant experience of suffering an
allergic shock, you can thank the IgE Antibody for the amazing time you
had that day. Or in a less life-threatening scenario, they are the thing
that makes you have allergic reactions to things that are harmless. From
the pollen of plants to peanuts or the sting of a bee. Of course,
evolution did not just come up with the concept of allergic reactions to
mess with you for no reason. The original purpose IgE Antibodies serve
is to protect you against infections by huge enemies: Parasites.
Especially worms. The how and why is a story that is best told in its
own chapter, so for now, let us ignore IgE Antibodies and allergies and
shake our fists angrily at them.</p>
<p>How Do B Cells Know What Sort of Antibody to Make?</p>
<p>Now you may ask yourself: If there are so many different types and
variants, how do B Cells know what sort of antibody is needed? After
all, the different classes of Antibodies do very different jobs very
well but are pretty useless at others.</p>
<p>We said before that the Dendritic Cells carry snapshots from the
battlefield to provide context. This snapshot of the context at the site
of infection is then communicated to the Helper T Cell. As time moves
on, new Dendritic Cell snapshots with different contexts arrive from the
battlefield. And so what was right at some point of an infection might
change over time.</p>
<p>So B Cells are not locked into making a certain class of
Antibody—they always start with IgM but can switch the Antibody type if
the Helper T Cell asks and encourages them to! Having a nasty cold or a
gut infection and need a lot of antibodies in your snot or stool? Make
IgA! Having a parasitic worm in your intestines? Make IgE! A lot of
bacteria have infected a wound? Make IgG flavor one! There are a lot of
virus-infected cells? Please, more IgG flavor three! (Once an Antibody
class has been switched there is no going back though.)</p>
<p>The amazing ability to collect and communicate intel on this level of
ingenuity is another testament to the stunning brilliance and beauty of
the great concert of the immune system. All the parts working together,
changing and working and coordinating, without any single part being
conscious or aware.</p>
<p>OK! You are done with the first section of the book! You learned so
much about so many different parts of yourself! You also finished the
hardest part of the book! Let’s take a big step back for a moment to
reflect on what we’ve learned so far.</p>
<p>We learned about the scope of your body, your cells, and some of your
most common enemies, bacteria. About your soldier and guard cells that
guard your insides, the mechanisms they use to identify and kill
invaders, and how they use inflammation to prepare the battlefields of
your body. We learned how your cells recognize things and how they
communicate with each other. We explored the complement system that
saturates every fluid in your body. We learned about your surveillance
cells that get help when necessary. We learned about your internal
infrastructure and how your body has billions of different weapons made
by recombination, how these superweapons are deployed and improved upon
through mutation. And of course we learned about your first line of
defense, your skin, and what a hellhole it is.</p>
<p>But if you think about it, compared to other diseases, how often do
you hear about people getting sick from infected wounds or skin
infections? The reality is that our skin is so effective as a defense
perimeter, that usually pathogens are easily repelled here. Most of the
infections that you will consciously deal with in your life will enter
your body elsewhere, in another kingdom. A kingdom that has to solve one
of the hardest conundrums of your entire defense network. And it is the
place where your most dangerous enemies strike you.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 What do we mean when we say that an Antibody “neutralizes” a
virus? Well, imagine your cells are a subway train and the virus a
passenger that wanted to get inside. This is usually fairly easy for the
virus, just pass one of the automated ticket barriers and enter through
one of the doors. An Antibody is basically grabbing and covering up the
ticket of the virus so it can’t pass the ticket barrier and is stuck
outside. The more Antibodies attach to the ticket, the more impossible
it becomes to get to the train. And so it is neutralized, unable to do
anything of consequence. A passenger stranded at the station.</p>
<p>*2 OK, OK, there are five antibody classes in humans but we are going
to ignore the poor IgD Antibody because it is not relevant for anything
we are talking about in this book. In a nutshell, IgD can help with
activating a bunch of immune cells and whatnot. But I think we had
enough details already and this is not that important. But there you
have it, a footnote to a headline!</p>
<p>*3 We mentioned before that your spleen is a sort of lymph node for
your blood but there is more! This tiny organ is the main source for
superfast responding IgM Antibodies in your blood. A sort of emergency
base that can react fast if pathogens like bacteria make it into your
blood flow, via an injury for example. The spleen filters your blood and
when it finds enemies here it can quickly activate B Cells that rapidly
make IgM Antibodies. Sure, they are not optimized like the other
Antibody classes, but they are available extremely quickly, which is
important when you have invaders in your blood—that gives a pathogen
access to the whole body! This is one of the things that makes your
spleen so important. This mechanism was discovered after wars, where due
to severe injuries to the torso, people often had their spleens removed.
It turned out that many of them died of sepsis later in life, at much
higher rates than the rest of the population. Nowadays, if your spleen
is damaged, say in a car crash, doctors try to save as much of it as
possible.</p>
