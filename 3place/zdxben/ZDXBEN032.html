<h4 id="autoimmune-disease">40 Autoimmune Disease</h4>
<p>Your body takes autoimmunity very seriously, as we learned by looking
at the Murder University of the Thymus, where only cells who could
distinguish self from other were allowed to live. And it became apparent
with the many hoops your T Cells and B Cells need to jump through before
they can get activated and actually start doing their job. But still,
despite all the security systems and different layers that are supposed
to prevent your immune system from attacking your own body, things can
go terribly wrong. Security mechanisms can fail in such an unlucky
sequence of events that your immune system thinks the body it was made
to protect is the enemy that it needs to kill.</p>
<p>It would be as if the army of a nation suddenly pointed its weapons
at its own defenseless cities and infrastructure. Tearing up roads,
bombing civilian centers, shooting at the construction workers,
baristas, and doctors who are just trying to keep society running. It
would be all the worse because if the military attacks its own country
and is really committed—who, exactly, could stop it? In a way this is
what autoimmune diseases are. While civilian cells try to keep
everything together, to get resources to everyone, and to keep the
bodily infrastructure and organs intact, parts of the army tear it down
again and shoot civilians in the head.</p>
<p>Autoimmune diseases don’t just happen though. For most people they
are a colossal case of bad luck. Although obviously things are a bit
more complicated in reality, we can look at the basic principles. In a
nutshell, in autoimmunity, your T and B Cells are able to recognize
proteins that are used by your own cells. Self-antigens. The antigens of
self. You.</p>
<p>This might be a protein on the surface of a liver cell, an important
molecule that keeps you alive like insulin, or a structure that is part
of a nerve cell, for example. If misguided T and B Cells connect to
these self-antigens, your adaptive immune system mounts an immune
response against your own body. So parts of your immune system are no
longer able to distinguish correctly between self and other—they think
that self IS other. This is various degrees of bad—from annoying, to
quality-of-life ruining, to deadly.</p>
<p>What needs to go wrong for your immune system to get so horribly
confused? Well, there are a few stages, a few conditions that need to be
met:</p>
<p>First of all, your MHC molecules actually need to be physically able
to bind to your own self-antigen efficiently. This is mostly genetic,
and as everything that is etched into our genetic code, bad luck. You
can’t choose your parents and you can’t choose your genetic makeup. (At
least not yet.) In an earlier chapter we talked about the fact that MHC
molecules vary a lot between different individuals and come in a few
hundred slightly different shapes. Not all of these shapes are great,
just by a whim of nature, some types are pretty good at presenting
self-antigen. There is a hereditary risk for autoimmunity that varies
between all of us—so while everybody can get autoimmune diseases,
chances are higher for some, those with genes that make specific MHC
molecule types. But just a genetic predisposition is not enough.</p>
<p>The second thing that needs to happen for an autoimmune disease to
develop, is that you need to produce either a T or a B Cell that is
actually able to recognize self-antigen and that does not get killed by
your own body. Each day you make billions of T Cells, for example, and
just by pure chance millions will come with receptors that can recognize
self-antigen efficiently. Most of these cells do not survive their
training in the thymus or bone marrow, but sometimes these mechanisms
fail and they get released into circulation. Chances are that right now,
you have some T or B Cells inside you that could cause an autoimmune
disease. But their presence alone is still not enough, they need to be
activated.</p>
<p>And here it becomes very tricky. We spent a good portion of this book
talking about the fact that your Adaptive Immune System does not just
activate by itself. It needs the Innate Immune System to make the
decision to activate it, and for that you first need a battleground. An
environment that can push your Innate Immune Cells to escalate an immune
reaction. How exactly these things happen is hard to say and even harder
to observe in living humans—people get sick all the time but only
extremely rarely does this lead to anything more than an infection that
is cleared out eventually. But for most autoimmune diseases, these seem
to be the steps that cause them:</p>
<p>Step one: There are individuals who have a genetic predisposition.
(Which is not a required step but it greatly enhances your chances.)</p>
<p>Step two: They make B or T Cells that are able to recognize a
self-antigen.</p>
<p>Step three: An infection provokes the Innate Immune System into
activating these faulty B or T Cells.</p>
<p>How exactly would infections cause autoimmune disease though? While
still not entirely answered, a popular idea among immunologists is
called molecular mimicry. It basically means that the antigens of
microorganisms can be similar in shape to the proteins of your cells,
your self-antigens. Now for one, this can happen by accident. Certain
shapes are just useful in the tiny world, and while there are a great
variety and a lot of options for shapes, some shapes still can be
similar.</p>
<p>But some pathogens will also try to mimic the shapes of their host,
which makes a lot of sense, since this is a mechanism we can observe
plenty in the animal kingdom: Camouflage is hugely beneficial if you
have to survive in a world of roaming hunters. And so from butterflies
that try to look like leaves to white partridges that blend in to snow
and crocodiles that disappear in muddy water, a wide range of animals
try to be as hard to spot as possible. For a pathogenic virus or a
bacteria your tissue is a jungle full of angry predators that are
looking for them, so mimicking the environment to become harder to spot
is an effective strategy.</p>
<p>To explain it properly, let us add a bit more detail to a
simplification we’ve made until now. When we talked about the largest
library in the universe we said that each T and B Cell is made with a
special receptor, to recognize exactly one specific antigen.</p>
<p>Well, it is a bit more complex. In actuality, the range of individual
T and B receptors is a bit wider. Each receptor is extremely good at
recognizing one specific antigen. But it can also connect to a few more
than exactly this one.</p>
<p>So a B Cell receptor for example might be extremely good at
recognizing one specific antigen and OK-ish at recognizing, say, eight
different other antigens that are similar but not exactly the same.</p>
<p>It’s kind of like when you are doing a puzzle, and you find two
pieces that almost fit together perfectly. Like there is still some
space left and they don’t connect perfectly but it does hold if you
don’t pull too hard.</p>
<p>Now, let us imagine how you might get an autoimmune disease in
reality. In our example everything begins with a pathogen, maybe a virus
that has an antigen that is similar to a self-antigen. For example, it
could be similar to a common protein that is inside your cells. When the
virus enters your body and begins doing what pathogens do, civilian
cells, Macrophages, and Dendritic Cells release massive amounts of
cytokines and cause inflammation. This triggers Dendritic Cells to
collect samples of the virus antigen, which is so similar to our
self-antigen. And it triggers all the cells near the battlefield to make
more MHC class I molecules, and showcase more of their internal
proteins.</p>
<p>In the closest lymph node, your Dendritic Cell may then find a Helper
T Cell or a Killer T Cell that can connect extremely well to the antigen
of the enemy. And because it is similar to a self-antigen, the T Cell
receptor also is pretty OK-ish at connecting to the self-antigen that
the antigen is similar to. The Killer T Cells enter the battlefield and
begin killing infected cells. But not just infected cells, they also
find healthy cells that present the self-antigen, the one that is
similar to the virus antigen, in their display windows. And so the
Killer T Cells begin killing perfectly innocent and healthy civilian
cells. Now the context of a real infection being active right now
becomes crucial. Because the Killer T Cells are stimulated and activated
by the real infection going on, by all the right cytokines and battle
signals, some of them will turn into Memory Killer T Cells. Even after
the actual infection has been wiped out, these cells will find the
autoantigen (or self-antigen) presented by civilian cells and just
assume there are still a lot of enemies around.</p>
<p>And as soon as this happens, the accidental autoimmune reaction turns
into an autoimmune disease. Now the adaptive immune system thinks that
it has been activated to fight the self-antigen and the body cells that
express it. And why wouldn’t it? In the case of Murphy’s Law, every
single thing that could go wrong did go wrong, and all the conditions
for a proper activation have been fulfilled. It still can get worse
though! Meanwhile, the activated Helper T Cell starts activating B Cells
that can accidentally fine-tune themselves on the self-antigen!</p>
<p>Remember, when activated B Cells begin an optimization process to
refine their Antibodies, they mutate and produce a bunch of different
variants, so they can become much better at fighting an enemy. But in
this case, they can actually optimize themselves to the self-antigen. In
the worst case, if such a B Cell gets a confirmation signal from a
Helper T Cell, the immune system produces Plasma Cells that release
autoantibodies that connect to your own cells and mark them for
death.</p>
<p>And when B Cells mature into Plasma Cells, Memory Cells are created
as a byproduct. So now all of a sudden, in your bone marrow, Long-Lived
Plasma Cells begin regularly pumping out autoantibodies against your own
body. They will live for years and decades. Once your adaptive immune
system has made Memory Cells against your own cells, it is sure to be
restimulated over and over again—as your self-antigens are, well,
everywhere inside your body. These cells now find themselves in a giant
world where everybody is an enemy—it’s like the joke of the guy driving
on the freeway when his wife calls him to warn him that she heard on the
radio that there is a driver going the wrong way. And he replies in a
very distressed voice: “Honey, there isn’t one, there are hundreds!”</p>
<p>No matter how many civilian cells your immune system kills, your body
will make more—and so chronic inflammation, chronic immune system
activation, is the consequence. Your misguided immune cells think they
are perpetually surrounded by enemies and act like it.</p>
<p>Although we are talking about a diverse set of different diseases,
there are many common symptoms among all of them: Fatigue, rashes,
itching, and other skin problems, fever, abdominal pain and a variety of
digestive issues, pain and swelling in the joints. Autoimmunity is
rarely fatal, it is not so much a group of diseases that kills. It is
more that it makes life miserable and draining. The treatment options
are somewhat limited—after all to eliminate the root of autoimmune
diseases you would need to find the individual Memory Cells among
billions of B and T Cells, which target your self-antigen and kill them.
So at least for now, there is no cure available for autoimmunity—once
you have it, you need to deal with it. To alleviate pain and
inflammation, generally autoimmune diseases are treated with a variety
of medication that suppresses the immune system, particularly
inflammation, which as you may imagine, is not great either. It may
alleviate the symptoms of autoimmunity by making the immune system
weaker and less likely to attack the body but it also leaves the patient
more vulnerable to infections.</p>
