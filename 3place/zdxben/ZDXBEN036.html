<h4 id="stress-and-the-immune-system">43 Stress and the Immune
System</h4>
<p>To understand the role of stress and the immune system, we have to
look back millions of years, to a simpler but much more cruel time in
our developmental history. In order to survive, your ancestors had to
deal with the evolutionary pressures the environment subjected them to.
In the wild, stress is usually connected with existential danger, like a
rival that crosses into your territory or a predator that wants to make
you its meal.</p>
<p>So for your ancestors it was a good idea to react strongly to
perceived danger because if you acted decisively, then you were more
likely to survive—if you were wrong and something was not actually
dangerous nothing was lost. If you were slow to react to potential
danger and you were wrong and it turned out to be actually dangerous,
something bigger would probably eat you. As a consequence, organisms
that were good at responding rapidly to a possible source of danger, a
stressor, real or not, were more successful at surviving and reproducing
than others who were not.</p>
<p>Over time and through this selective pressure, our ancestors became
fine-tuned to recognize stressors quickly and to react swiftly to them,
often with automated processes. In mammals for example, this meant
glands that are able to rapidly release stress hormones, which
accelerated the delivery of oxygen and sugar to the heart and skeletal
muscles and made it possible to react to a threat instantly and with
power. Behavioral adaptations like the fight-or-flight response saved
even more crucial time and helped them to survive in the wild. Because
if you think you have spotted a lion in your peripheral vision, it is a
better survival strategy to start running or to throw your spear than to
carefully consider for a minute if that really was a lion or just a bush
that sorta looked like one.</p>
<p>In the context of these sorts of adaptations, it makes sense that
your immune system also responds to stress. No matter if you fight or
flee, in both cases, the likelihood that you will get wounded increases
dramatically, which means that pathogenic microorganisms might have an
opportunity to infect you, making your immune system immediately
relevant. So one of the adaptations to stress was to accelerate certain
immune mechanisms while slowing down others.</p>
<p>Now we can call ourselves incredibly lucky that we left the lifestyle
of our ancestors behind us and invented civilization and food delivery
and comfy homes and that we killed all the large things that tried to
eat us (the small things that are still trying to eat us are a bit
harder to manage, unfortunately). But despite all of these great
inventions, our bodies unfortunately did not get the memo yet. They
still behave as if we were trying to survive in the savannah or as if we
had to deal with wild lions hunting us on a regular basis. And so they
still hold on to as many calories as possible, despite the abundance of
food in the modern world. And they are triggering a stress response in
situations that actually require calmness and clear thinking. Running
away will not help you to pass the exam tomorrow. You can’t physically
fight your client if the deadline is close (OK, technically you can, but
it probably won’t help you). Our body does not know that though, and
thus this unfortunate misunderstanding causes stress. Psychological
stress has actual and immediate physical consequences for the immune
system, many of them not helpful.</p>
<p>The thing about stress is that it is similar to your immune response
in one extremely important aspect: When it works as it is intended to,
stress is a great mechanism that helps solve an immediate problem and
then shuts itself off afterwards. But the nature of the stressors we
encounter in the modern world is different than the ones we evolved
with. In the past the lion either got you or you escaped—either way,
your stress stopped. It rarely followed you around for weeks or months,
like exam season or a large project for a demanding client. And so a
mechanism that was meant to support short bursts of activity has turned
into a chronic background noise.</p>
<p>So what is the effect of chronic stress on your immune system? Well,
as so often before, it’s very complicated and not at all
straightforward. When we talk about stress and its effect on health we
open up topics like depression, loneliness, specific life situations,
and the different ways people deal with them. As soon as your behavior
is involved, things become hard and fuzzy. You can’t just say that
chronic stress causes autoimmune diseases because it could be and almost
certainly is more nuanced.</p>
<p>For example, we know that stress can be one of the factors that lead
people to smoke more cigarettes. And smoking is a risk factor for
autoimmune diseases like arthritis. So we need to be very careful with
our words in this section because a lot of uncertainties exist here!
Having gotten this disclaimer out of the way, it is clear that chronic
stress is very unhealthy and related to a number of diseases and
conditions.</p>
<p>In general, chronic stress seems to disrupt the ability of the body
to shut down inflammation and causes chronic inflammation. And as we
discussed before, chronic inflammation has been linked to a higher risk
for numerous diseases, from cancer to diabetes, heart and autoimmune
diseases, and also a general frailty and higher chance of death. Chronic
stress changes the behavior of your Helper T, which is not great since
they are particularly important conductors and influence a number of
other immune responses. This can lead your Helper T into making the
wrong decisions, which can throw your immune response out of
balance.</p>
<p>Stress also releases hormones like cortisol that shut down and
suppress your immune system, making it weaker and less able to do its
job properly in a variety of ways. Wounds heal slower, infections are
more likely to break out and to cause disease. Already present pathogens
or diseases can no longer be held in check efficiently, leading to an
outbreak of herpes, for example. Or in more serious cases, to a much
faster progression of HIV. Chronic stress means a chronic release of
cortisol, which generally slows your defense systems down.*</p>
<p>A pretty strong connection has also been made in recent years between
the onset of autoimmune diseases and stress. And stress also seems to be
one of many risk factors for tumor progression.</p>
<p>OK, so this range of possible diseases could not possibly be
broader—it seems that chronic stress negatively affects every single
area where the immune system is supposed to protect you.</p>
<p>So if you are still looking for ways to boost your immune system, an
actual tangible thing you can start doing today is to try to eliminate
stressors in your life and to take care of your mental health. This
might seem like pretty daft advice because it is so obvious, but the
connection between your state of mind and your health is very real. So
helping people live happy and fulfilled lives with less stress and
depression would probably have considerable health benefits for our
societies.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an issue in professions that are very taxing for the body,
like elite Special Forces units in the military or professional
athletes. One downside of these kinds of jobs is higher levels of
cortisol and lower levels of antibodies and important cytokines.</li>
