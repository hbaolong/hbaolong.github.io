<h4 id="shutting-the-immune-system-down">34 Shutting the Immune System
Down</h4>
<p>About a week after the flu hit you like a freight train you wake up
one morning and feel considerably better. Not over it, but better. Your
temperature is lower, you have some appetite, and just overall you feel
more like yourself. The next few days your job will be to rest and let
your immune system clean up and wind down as you enjoy the last few days
of being sick that mostly consist of watching TV and being cared for by
increasingly annoyed loved ones.</p>
<p>This “winding down” phase is as important as activating your immune
system. An active immune system causes collateral damage and uses up a
huge amount of energy so your body wants it to be done as soon as
possible. But then again, how crazy dangerous would it be if your immune
system stopped working before a disease was beaten and pathogens could
flare up again, overwhelming the retreating forces?</p>
<p>It needs to shut itself down at precisely the correct time, which is
easier said than done if you have millions and billions of active cells
fighting, without a form of central authority or conscious thought. So
as with its activation, your immune system relies on self-enforcing
systems to end a defense.</p>
<p>Activation usually begins with an initial exposure of immune cells to
intruders, like bacteria, or danger signals, like the insides of dead
cells. For example, Macrophages get activated when they notice an enemy
and release cytokines that call up Neutrophils and cause inflammation.
The Neutrophils themselves release more Cytokines, causing more
inflammation and reactivating Macrophages, who continue fighting.
Complement proteins stream into the site of infection from the blood,
attack pathogens, opsonize them, and help the soldier cells to swallow
the enemies.</p>
<p>Dendritic Cells sample enemies and make their way to the Lymph Nodes
to activate Helper T Cells or Killer T Cells, or both. Helper T Cells
stimulate the innate immune soldiers to continue fighting and create
more inflammation. Killer T Cells start killing infected civilian cells
with support from Natural Killer Cells. Meanwhile, activated B Cells
have turned into Plasma Cells and release millions of Antibodies that
stream onto the battlefield and disable the pathogens, maiming them and
making them much easier to clear up. This is the immune response in a
nutshell.</p>
<p>As more and more enemies are killed and their numbers are dwindling,
fewer and fewer battle cytokines are released, because fewer immune
cells are stimulated by ongoing fights.</p>
<p>This means no more new soldiers are called in while the old ones die
off or stop fighting. The cytokines that cause inflammation are used up
relatively quickly, so without new and engaged soldiers that constantly
release new cytokines, the inflammation reactions begin receding
naturally, which also slowly has the complement system fizzle out.</p>
<p>Fewer signals from the battlefield means that the activation of new T
Cells first slows down and then stops, while active T Cells become
harder to stimulate the longer they are active, until eventually most of
them kill themselves.</p>
<p>No part of your immune system is made to work forever without
stimulation and so if the chain of activations stops, step-by-step, the
immune response winds down.</p>
<p>In the end your Macrophages devour and clean up the carcasses of the
brave immune cells that fought so hard to eradicate the infection to
protect you. And so, just as your immune system is winning, it is
already shutting itself off without any sort of central planning.</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions because there is one type of cell that
actively switches your defenses off and calms down the immune response:
Regulatory T Cells. They make up only about 5% of T Cells and in a sense
are “opposite Helper T Cells.”</p>
<p>For example they can order Dendritic Cells to become worse at
activating the Adaptive Immune System or they can make Helper T Cells
slow and tired, so they don’t proliferate as much. They can turn Killer
T Cells into much less vicious fighters, shut down inflammation, and
make it recede faster. In a nutshell, they can end an immune reaction or
just prevent it from being triggered in the first place.</p>
<p>Especially in your gut, Regulatory T Cells are crucial—which makes a
lot of sense when you think about it: What really is the gut if not an
endless, tubelike metropolitan area for commensal bacteria that your
body wants to be there? It would be hugely detrimental for your health
if your immune system in the gut was truly set free here. Constant
inflammation and constant fighting would be the consequence. So
Regulatory T Cells keep the peace. Maybe their most important job though
is to act as a countermeasure to autoimmune diseases, where they prevent
your cells from attacking your body.</p>
<p>Regulatory T Cells are one of the parts of the immune system where
things become very blurry. In this book we are trying to be clear and to
paint the picture of a structured and orderly system. Unfortunately
there are areas where this is harder to do than in others and Regulatory
T Cells is one of them. So we will not dive into any more detail here
because there is a lot of complexity buried here and a lot that is not
completely understood yet.</p>
<p>OK, so we learned how an immune response is triggered, how it clears
an infection, and how it powers down afterwards, but we are still
missing the last really important puzzle piece: Your long-term
protection, also known as immunity. Why do you get many diseases just
once in your life and what does it mean if you become “immune” to
anything?</p>
