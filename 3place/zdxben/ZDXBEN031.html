Parasites and How Your Immune System Might Miss Them</h4>
<p>Parasites could provide some answers to the annoying nature of
allergies. One of the worst things to do late at night is to google
infections by parasitic worms. You can ruin your life even more if you
click on image search. Of all the possible pathogens and parasites that
can victimize humans, worms are by far the most upsetting ones. Nothing
quite compares to a faceless, slimy, stringy thing that drills itself
through your insides, pooping, laying eggs, spending its whole life
inside you. It’s right out of a horror movie.</p>
<p>There are nearly 300 species of parasitic worms who can infest
humans. And while only around a dozen of these species are widespread,
they still infect up to two billion people, close to a third of
humanity. Most species of these parasitic worms tend to establish stable
chronic infections that can persist for up to twenty years, while their
eggs or larvae leave your body with your poop. Parasitic worms thrive in
underdeveloped rural regions or in slums, where unsanitary conditions
and dirty water combine into an environment perfect for parasites that
leave the body on one end and enter through another.*1</p>
<p>Being infested by parasitic worms is not a great experience. Take
hookworms, for example, parasites that are about half an inch long and
live in your guts. Their name is their game, as they hook themselves
into the walls of your intestines and can cause extensive blood loss.
This in turn can cause anemia, the lack of healthy red blood cells to
carry enough oxygen to your organs and tissues, weakening the whole
body. Infested people have greenish-yellow pallor and are tired, weak,
and generally low on energy. The hookworms produce eggs that leave
through your feces and when the eggs turn into larvae, they bore through
the skin of a new host and migrate to the lungs from where they
ultimately end up in the small intestines again, to repeat the cycle
anew.</p>
<p>Seriously, thanks, but no thanks.</p>
<p>Parasitic worms are genuinely not fun at all. Until pretty recently
in human history, infections by worms were widespread and basically
unavoidable.*2</p>
<p>Against parasitic worms, the weird mechanism of the IgE Antibody
suddenly makes a lot of sense. From the scale of an immune cell, worms
are giant monsters, reaching far into the sky beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>Attacking them needs to come with some punch to even have some hope
to do damage. It requires a lot of combined effort from the immune
system to kill a worm and rid the body of its presence. Millions of
years ago, the immune system of our ancestors came up with a strategy:
Stage one is to recognize the worm and prepare a brutal attack.</p>
<p>So when the worm is recognized for the first time—probably close to
the border regions of the body—the special B Cells stationed near the
skin or in the respiratory or intestinal tracts begin the preparation by
making large amounts of IgE Antibodies. These IgE Antibodies “prime”
your Mast Cells—if you consider Mast Cells weapons, IgE Antibodies
activate them and remove the safety pins. If the immune system then
encounters the worm again, Mast Cells can connect to them with the IgE
Antibodies on their surfaces and vomit their harsh weapons directly onto
them from very close range. Not only does the mix of chemicals damage
and hurt the worm, but the harsh and immediate inflammation that the
Mast Cell triggers alerts the rest of the immune system. Macrophages and
Neutrophils will swarm in and continue to attack the worm. The Basophils
will be alerted by the commotion making sure the attack will not be
exhausted before the worm is actually killed. The Eosinophils from the
bone marrow move in later and continue to attack the worm and its
eventual buddies in the coming hours and days.</p>
<p>With this combined effort from these different cells, parasites like
worms can be killed by your immune system. This is a good moment to
marvel again about the huge variety of dangers our ancestors had to deal
with—and how their immune system found ways to handle all of them. But
we were talking about allergies originally, so let us find the
connection to our horrifying wormy enemies.</p>
<p>As you may imagine, parasitic worms are not happy about IgE and Mast
Cells and being attacked and all—since they are living beings
specializing in…well…being parasites, they evolved to deal with our
defenses whenever possible. In this case this means shutting down your
defense. Parasitic worms that have adapted to humans are able to modify
and recalibrate almost every facet of their host’s immune system. They
employ a wide range of immunosuppressive mechanisms. Or put simply:
Worms release a plethora of chemicals to downregulate and modulate your
immune system to make it weaker.</p>
<p>This has a large variety of consequences, some intended and some
unintended. For one, a weaker immune system is worse at preventing
infection from viruses and bacteria and it might have a harder time
catching cancerous cells before they become a deadly threat. But not all
of the effects are actually bad. Worms suppress the mechanisms that
cause inflammation reactions, allergies, and autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>We will learn a bit more about autoimmune diseases in the next
chapter—but in a nutshell, if the immune system is downregulated to be
less aggressive, it also can’t do as much damage to the body. Because of
this fact, some scientists argue the lack of worms in humans in the
developed world is weird for your immune system because it evolved
assuming that you would suffer from parasitic worms on a regular
basis.</p>
<p>Our ancestors were basically helpless when it came to parasitic
worms. They did not have any drugs against them, they did not understand
the nature of hygiene, and they often didn’t have access to clean
drinking water in the environment they lived in. So their bodies,
begrudgingly, had to adapt to frequent, if not permanent infestations by
parasitic worms. One of these adaptations might have been to upregulate
the aggressiveness of the immune system. Basically making it a bit too
aggressive, so that in spite of the suppressing effects of the worms, it
was strong enough to deal with infections and infestations by pathogens.
A sort of deal with the devil that our immune systems had to enter into
millions of years ago.</p>
<p>In evolutionary terms, humans in developed countries in the last few
hundred years or so suddenly lost their parasitic wormy guests. The
advent of soap and hygiene and the clear separation of poop and drinking
water destroyed the life cycles of most of the worms that were living
within us. The remaining worms were exiled by drugs and modern
medicine.</p>
<p>Which left our immune system suddenly without the enemy that had kept
it down a notch for millions of years. And so it might be that our
immune system still operates under the assumption that worms are making
it weaker and that it needs to be more aggressive as a
counterbalance.</p>
<p>If this general idea is true it might explain a lot of diseases
caused by too-aggressive immune systems in people without worms, mostly
allergies and inflammatory disease. And not only that—the lack of worms
leaves a whole bunch of our cells without the enemy they were made to
fight on a regular basis. So the idea makes sense that without wormy
stimulation, these weapons just found new targets.</p>
<p>But while parasitic worms may be a piece of the puzzle, they alone
are not nearly enough to explain the rise in the prevalence of allergies
and the rise of a set of much more serious disorders that affect
millions of people: Autoimmune diseases. They are what happens when the
immune system thinks your body is other—and that it needs to be
destroyed.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 Unfortunately, as parasitic worm infestations correlate with
poverty and low infrastructure development, there is another bonus
problem on top. If you suffer from malnutrition, a parasitic worm is a
much larger problem for you than if you are well fed. Which makes sense
because on a fundamental level, the worm is inside you because it wants
to steal your nutrients. If you have a hard time getting enough calories
for yourself, having subtenants in your body that don’t pay rent can
seriously weaken your whole system. So the people who are the least
fortunate suffer the most from these parasites.</p>
<p>*2 Well, actually, they are still widespread. Just not in developed
countries.</p>
