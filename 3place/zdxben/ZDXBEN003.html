<h4 id="what-is-there-to-defend">2 What Is There to Defend?</h4>
<p>Before we can really learn about your intricate defense system, we
should take a look at what needs to be defended: Your body. In a sense
this seems pretty straightforward—it is the entire area under and
including your skin. Simple enough, right? But just like looking at a
planet in space, you will never see anything remotely approaching the
full picture from orbit.</p>
<p>So before we do anything else, first we need to go on a journey
together, into a strange and foreign world, stranger than the deep sea
or an alien planet. A world where no living being therein even knows
that it exists, where monsters are a daily reality but nobody cares. A
world billions of years old, that exists within yourself, within
everybody and everything, all around us, omnipresent but invisible. This
is the world of the tiny, where the border between dead and alive
becomes fuzzy. Where biochemistry becomes life for reasons we still do
not understand. Let us zoom in to you and take a look—into your organs,
through the tissue, to our most fundamental building blocks, your
cells.</p>
<p>Cells are extremely tiny, living things, among the smallest units of
life on earth. For a single cell, your body is a planet drifting through
a hostile universe. To understand the enormous dimensions of your body
we need to look at it from a cell’s perspective. At the scale of a cell,
your body is an utterly gigantic structure of pipes as wide as
mountains, filled with oceans of fluids, rapid torrents permeating
intricate cave systems stretching as far as whole countries. With the
exception of the crystallized and hard parts of your bones, all of the
environment, all of the world, really, is, to a cell, alive. A cell can
politely ask a wall to let it pass and then squeeze through a tiny gap
that closes behind it. It can swim through channels and hike up
mountains of meat to get anywhere it needs to go.</p>
<p>If you were the size of one of your cells, the body of a human would
be in the area of fifteen to twenty Mount Everests stacked on top of
each other. It would be a mountain of flesh at least sixty miles (a
hundred kilometers) tall, reaching into space. If you are near a window
take a second and look into the sky. Try to imagine this for a moment, a
giant so large that passenger planes would crash against its lower legs,
its head so far above you that you would not be able to see it.</p>
<p>The cells of your immune system are tasked to defend all of that.
Especially the weak points where intruders can enter it, which is mostly
the borders, the outsides of the body. When you think about your
outsides, the first thing that comes to mind is, of course, your skin.
The total surface area of your skin is about two square yards (meters)
(about half the size of a pool table) and luckily is not that hard to
defend, since most of it is made out of a hard and thick barrier covered
with its own defense system. It feels soft, but it is pretty hard to
breach if it is intact.</p>
<p>Your real weak points to infections are your mucous membranes—the
surface that lines your windpipe and lungs, eyelids, mouth, and nose,
your stomach and intestines, your reproductive tracts and bladder. It is
hard to give their total surface area since numbers vary so much from
person to person, but on average there are about 200 square yards
(meters) of mucous membranes in a healthy adult (about the same as a
tennis court), most of them being your lungs and your digestive
tract.</p>
<p>You may mistakenly think of your mucous membranes as your insides.
But this is not true—your mucous membranes are outsides. If we took an
honest look at what you are, you are, in a sense, nothing more than a
complex tube. Granted, a tube that can close both ends. Also a lot
wetter, slimier, and grosser.</p>
<p>Your reproductive organs, nostrils, and ears are extra
holes—entrances to large tunnels and additional cave systems that reach
through you. All of these places are your direct borders, contact points
with the outside world. Your body is just wrapped around them. These
outsides, within your insides, represent surfaces where millions of
intruders are trying to enter you every day. A lot of ground to defend
when you are the size of a cell. For your cells, the surface area of the
mucous membranes is as big as Central Europe or the central United
States are to you. Building border walls would not do the trick for
them, since they don’t need to defend just the borders, but the entire
surface! It’s not like intruders are trying to enter just at the edges.
They could sort of drop in with parachutes. So your cells need to defend
the entire continent. All of it.</p>
<p>Still, it’s much easier to catch an enemy at one of these points than
somewhere else—for example, if we took all the blood vessels and
capillaries from your body and laid them out in a straight line, they
would be a baffling 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometers) long—three times
the circumference of Earth—with about 1,400 square yards (1,200 square
meters) of surface area. So, better catch enemies at the borders that
are significantly smaller and therefore easier to defend. But easier
does not mean easy.</p>
<p>Let’s do a fun experiment and imagine that we wanted to build a human
body to scale but from actual people, like you. Living breathing humans,
just to see what sort of crazy dimensions we encounter here.</p>
<p>So first, we need a lot of people for that. The average human body is
made from around forty trillion cells. Trillion! Forty trillion is
40,000,000,000,000. A truly impressive number. If we want your cells to
be represented by individual people, then we need more than one hundred
times as many people as have lived in the 250,000-year-long history of
humanity. Let’s try to visualize this a bit. Right now around 7.8
billion people are alive. If we put them shoulder to shoulder, they
surprisingly would only cover an area of around 700 square miles (1,800
square kilometers). Which is a little bit more than the surface area of
London. To get forty trillion people we need to multiply this by
120.*</p>
<p>OK. So we now have forty trillion people, standing shoulder to
shoulder. This ocean of people would cover the whole of the United
Kingdom, every last corner, lake, and mountain. To make a body to scale,
made of people representing cells, we need to stack them until trillions
of people are standing on top of each other, holding hands and linking
arms, forming living structures. A giant made out of flesh rises 60
miles (100 kilometers) into the sky, reaching the edge of space. The
giant is made up of caverns as wide as small countries, bones as dense
and wide as mountains, filled with intricate caves and tunnels. Its
arteries are filled with oceans of fluid and people carrying food and
oxygen tanks to every last corner. If you were a red blood cell, or in
this case “red blood person,” you would travel the distance from Paris
to Rome and back once a minute in a stream pumped by a heart as large as
a city. Things could be great. Everybody would work together to keep the
mountain of flesh, and in consequence, themselves, alive.</p>
<p>But the enormous richness of resources and food and the abundance of
moist, warm space is just too attractive. The giant is not only the size
of a continent for its inhabitants but also for unwelcome visitors.
Literally billions of parasites are trying to get inside the flesh
giant. Some are as large as elephants or blue whales and they want to
lay giant eggs so their young can feast on the poor people that make up
the tissues. Others are the size of raccoons or rats who want to steal
the food and make the giant their permanent home to raise generations of
their offspring. They may not intend harm to the people making up the
body, but they will do so by defecating everywhere, making life
miserable. The most disgusting vermin our flesh giant has to deal with
daily are billions of spiders who want to enter the cell people’s mouths
or ears to breed in the stomachs of their victims. For a giant made up
of trillions of people, losing a few here and there is not really
dangerous. But if the vermin were allowed to procreate freely, it could
be its end. Isn’t the idea horrifying?</p>
<p>This is what your cells deal with every single day and night, from
your birth until the day you die. Staying alive is not a thing you
should take for granted. But don’t let this idea of being attacked
distress you too much. You are not just a mountain of flesh waiting to
be conquered. Thankfully you have a great ally in this fight for
survival that, as we now know, we simply don’t cherish and celebrate as
much as it deserves: your immune system.</p>
<p>It makes you a fortress. And even more, a fortress filled with
billions of the most effective and fierce soldiers in the universe. They
have countless weapons at their disposal and they use them without
mercy. Your immune system army has already killed billions of enemies
and parasites in your life, and it is ready to kill billions or
trillions more.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>And this is only half of the story because your body hosts bacteria
that you need to survive. How many? One bacterium for each of the forty
trillion cells in your body (which happens to be a pretty good ballpark
in terms of size; if you were the size of an average body cell, a
bacterium would be roughly the size of a bunny). Let us imagine them as
baby bunnies to make the thought less horrifying. Most of these cute
bunnies live in your gut. In this ginormous cave, 36 trillion bunnies
live their lives, constantly dying and reproducing, breaking down chunks
of food the size of skyscrapers so it can be distributed to all the
people making up the continent of flesh. The other four trillion bunnies
are crawling on your skin, are inside your lungs, hopping over your
teeth and your tongue, they swim in the fluid of your eyes, crawl in and
out of your ears. We’ll talk more about them later but for now just
imagine yourself as being covered by cute bunnies who are your friends
and have only your best interests in mind.</li>
