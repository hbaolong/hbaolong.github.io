<h4 id="a-final-word">A Final Word</h4>
<p>As with every good journey, arriving somewhere is as important as
leaving in the first place. We saw a great many things and many complex
and intertwined systems. We got to know all your surfaces, inside and
outside, and their intricate defense networks. We met your soldiers,
from black rhinos that are calm most of the time to crazy monkeys with
machine guns.</p>
<p>We observed how your immune system jumps into gear when your body is
breached and wounded, how multiple layers of complexity work together to
organize exactly the correct type of defense over distances that are
enormously large for your tiny cells. We visited the largest library in
the universe and the deadliest university that you carry with you
without even thinking about it.</p>
<p>We witnessed a sneaky attack on your most inner self by an army of
viruses that was as effective as it was cruel and uncaring. We explored
how your immune system remembers its battles and how we as humans can
assist it with that. We took a look at what happens when your immune
system fails or when it overcommits and becomes the source of disease
and damage. And while we did dive pretty deep at times, there are so
many more amazing places and systems we did not have time to visit. But
if you made it to this page, you have gotten a real roundtrip through
your own body and some of the most important things you probably never
thought about.</p>
<p>An annoying thing about the immune system is that you need to
understand multiple things at the same time before the whole system
begins to make sense, and before its true beauty reveals itself. If you
understand Macrophages and MHC molecules and cytokines and T Cell
receptors and the lymphatic system and antibodies, then they all combine
into an amazingly elegant system that makes so much sense and is pretty
stunning.</p>
<p>But getting started is extremely hard because the immune system seems
to be designed to be opaque and hard to grasp. I complained a bunch
about the language of immunology and while that was hopefully mildly
amusing to you, in reality, it was not so much for me. To research this
book I had to read textbooks and academic papers with the speed of a
first grader, just so I could keep up with what they tried to say. I
can’t imagine a field that would profit more from cleaning up its
language and making an effort to become more palatable to the general
public. Because in the end, immunology is truly one of the coolest
topics ever.</p>
<p>Science offers such a diverse array of topics that you can immerse
yourself in. And in popular culture it is often the seemingly large
topics and fields that are the most beloved. Space, for example, with
its huge distances and black holes and gigantic stars, is an easy sell
for documentaries and popular science books. But while space is nice and
all, it has nothing over biology. Stars are dead clumps of burning
plasma, and even the most complex and interesting one can’t compete with
the wonder and complexity of the simplest bacteria trying to escape a
Macrophage.</p>
<p>The immune system is not as pleasing, not as accommodating as other
fields of popular science. It asks a lot of you up front. A certain
investment of time and pain is necessary to get to the point where you
can really appreciate it. And in a time where the expectation is that
information has to be pleasing and easy to digest this feels like a lot
to ask. Despite these challenges, the immune system is one of the best
topics to learn about because of the fact that it is so complex and made
up of so many layers that all interact in such ingenious ways—it is like
a window into the universe itself. A window into the complexity that
surrounds you and that you are a part of. You are incredibly lucky to be
alive and to have a body that you can call your own. Or at least I feel
that way.</p>
<p>So I would argue that it is worth the investment because the payoff
is so amazing and I hope if you read this far, you feel the same. Once
you reach the mountaintop and get a sort of clear picture of the immune
system, the view is like no other. You get a taste of what it means to
stay alive in a world that is a struggle between different forces that
do not care about how you feel about them.</p>
<p>All of this beautiful complexity carries a hint of sadness. It stings
a bit to know that life is too short and too busy to truly learn about
all the layers that make up reality. But hey, in the end there is
nothing we can do about that. What we can do is to take up the challenge
from time to time and put in the effort to get a glimpse into something
so much larger than us.</p>
<p>Even if we will never get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>Sources</p>
<p>Publishing printed things is weird because you need to finish so
early before actual publication. So in order to save time and make the
lives of the printers easier, a detailed bibliography of the papers and
books used for the research of the book can be found online at
https://kurzgesagt.org/immune-book-sources/.</p>
<p>For Cathi and Mochi</p>
<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>This book would not exist without the generous help of experts who
took time for me from their busy schedules doing actual science and
stuff. They patiently answered my many questions, steered me in the
right direction when I got lost in the research, told incredible stories
about the immune system and its adversaries, and were just incredibly
fun to talk to. All while being occupied with making the world better
during a global pandemic that did not make anybody’s life easier.</p>
<p>So a huge thank you to Dr. James Gurney, who gave extensive feedback,
did a lot of fact checking, and told exciting stories from the world of
microbes and viruses. Book bro fist to Professor Thomas Brocker, the
director of the Munich Institute for Immunology, for jumping on many
video calls to answer multitudes of often weird questions about details
of immunology. And transatlantic high five to Professor Maristela
Martins de Camargo of the University of São Paulo for the many amazing
and mysterious stories about all the crazy things our immune cells
do!</p>
<p>I would never have dared to publish a book about such a complicated
topic without your help and I remain incredibly grateful for your time
and enthusiasm. On top of that, it was such a genuine blast learning
from all of you and I hope after the pandemic is over we can touch
glasses at some point!</p>
<p>Then I want to thank my friends Cathi Ziegler, John Green, Matt
Caplan, CGP Grey, Lizzy Steib, Tim Urban, Philip Laibacher, and Vicky
Dettmer, all of whom read the whole book at various stages of
completion, some of them multiple times. Thank you all for your detailed
feedback and conversations about the right tone, letting me know if
jokes landed or if the explanations worked. Thank you for being brutally
honest with me when necessary and for being encouraging when I was down
and didn’t believe this book was possible to finish. It’s a huge ask for
a friend to read a whole book and then give feedback, especially if it’s
not finished yet, so I’m extremely grateful that you took the time.
Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Thank you to Philip Laibacher, the first employee and Creative
Director of Kurzgesagt–In a Nutshell, for creating the beautiful
illustrations in the book and the amazing cover. And thank you for
sacrificing a part of your Christmas vacation so everything could be
done in time.</p>
<p>Of course I also owe a huge thanks to my agent Seth Fishman from the
Gernert Company for calming me down when I felt a bit panicky about
writing my first book and for getting this whole thing started. To my
editor, Ben Greenberg from Random House, for believing in this project,
editing the early drafts and pushing them in the right direction, and
just for being a calm presence in this whole process. Thank you both for
not laughing at me when I confidently said, like an idiot, that I’d
finish this book in three months. To Kaeli Subberwal, Rebecca Gardner,
and Jack Gernert for patiently dealing with me as I was a cliché author
type who never answered his emails. A big thank you to all people at the
Gernert Company and Random House for dealing with me and being great at
their jobs and being so positive and making this book possible.</p>
<p>I also want to thank my whole team at Kurzgesagt–In a Nutshell. I
sorta just took a prolonged leave to write a book that was dear to my
heart, and my team had my back and kept the channel and the company
running. Sorry for being bad at communicating at times—I appreciate all
of you and the work you do.</p>
<p>A big thanks to all the viewers and fans of Kurzgesagt. Like, I don’t
know most of you personally and I never know what to say when someone
tells me to my face that the work my team and I do means something to
them. But here in the safety of a printed page: Thank you for liking the
stuff I write and thank you for supporting it. It means the world.</p>
<p>And if you read this book and got this far: There are so many other
things you could have read but you read this thing. So thank you.</p>
