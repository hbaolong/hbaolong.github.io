Aside The Spleen and the Tonsils—Super Lymph Node Best Friends</h4>
<p>One part of your lymphatic infrastructure is a special little organ
that most people are not really aware of although it is pretty
important. The Spleen is a sort of large lymph node, about the size of a
peach but bean shaped. Just like lymph nodes it is a sort of filter but
with a much larger scope. For one, the spleen is the place in your body
where 90% of your old blood cells are filtered and recycled when their
life comes to an end. On top of that your spleen stores an emergency
reserve of blood, about a cup, which is invaluable if something bad
happens and you could use a bit of extra blood in your body. This is
still not all, 25 to 30% of your red blood cells and 25% of your
platelets (remember, the cell fragments that can close wounds) are
stored here for emergencies.</p>
<p>But the spleen is not just an emergency blood storage for injuries
but also one of the centers of your soldier cells, a sort of barracks.
The main home for another immune cell we did not mention before even
though it did help out during the cut: the Monocyte. Monocytes are
basically reinforcement cells that can transform into Macrophages and
Dendritic Cells. About half of them patrol in your blood right now where
they represent the largest single cell that floats through your
cardiovascular system. If you suffer an injury and an infection that
drains and kills a lot of your Macrophages, they come in as backup. Once
they enter the site of infection, they stop being Monocytes and
transform into fresh Macrophages. This way, even if you lose a lot of
Macrophages to an intense battle, you have a fresh influx of them that
does not run out.</p>
<p>The other half of your Monocytes sit in your spleen as a reserve
emergency force. While it’s easy to think of Monocytes just as
replacement Macrophages, there are Monocyte subclasses that have more
specialized jobs like working as inflammation superchargers, or they are
called to the heart during a heart attack to help the heart tissue with
healing itself.</p>
<p>On top of serving as an emergency reservoir and a barracks, the
spleen really is just a huge lymph node that filters your blood (and not
your lymph fluid, like your regular lymph nodes do) and does all the
things lymph nodes do. So when we discuss the function of lymph nodes in
more detail, just remember that your spleen does the same thing, only
with your blood!</p>
<p>People regularly lose their spleens, for example after traffic
accidents where a strong blow to the torso can rupture the small organ
critically, so that it has to be removed. Surprisingly this is not as
deadly as you might think. Other organs like the liver, regular lymph
nodes, and your bone marrow can take over most of its jobs. And about
30% of people happen to have a second spleen that is tiny but will grow
and take over the job if the first one is removed.</p>
<p>But it is like, not great to lose your spleen because as you may have
thought, most organs in your body exist for a reason. Patients who lose
their spleen often become vastly more susceptible to certain diseases
like pneumonia, which can be deadly in the worst case. So while it is no
death sentence to lose this tiny, weird organ, try to keep it if you
can!</p>
<p>The Tonsils are known to people only as weird lumpy things in the
back ends of their throats that sometimes have to be surgically removed
in children. But they are not just annoying bits of useless tissue. Your
tonsils are something like a center of your immune system intelligentsia
in your mouth. A lot of different immune cells that we will get to know
in this book work here to keep you healthy. To get samples to them, your
tonsils have deep valleys where tiny pieces of food can get stuck.
Microfold Cells, very curious cells that grab all sorts of stuff from
your mouth and pull it deep into the tissue, where they show it to the
rest of the immune cell to check out.</p>
<p>This is useful in two ways basically: At a young age this trains your
immune system so it can recognize what kinds of the food you eat are
harmless and should not be reacted against. And to be able to produce
weapons against invaders if it finds any. We will explain all these
mechanisms in detail in the rest of the book, so let us not venture in
too deep here. If your tonsils are overeager and work too hard, they can
become chronically inflamed and swell up, which can cause all sorts of
unpleasant symptoms. Sometimes this makes it necessary to remove them
surgically, but this depends on the case and is generally not a huge
deal if the patient is older than seven years old and has a solid immune
system. In a nutshell, what you really need to know about your tonsils
is that they are immune bases that actively sample what comes into your
body.*3</p>
<p>OK, time to get back to our battlefield! Let us be mysterious for a
moment. The Adaptive Immune System awakens. Very slowly, like a teenager
who was awoken by their mother before sunrise, it stretches and groans
as it slowly slides out of bed and gathers its strength.</p>
<p>Back at the site of infection, its presence is desperately
needed.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 Although “beating” is not a good way to describe it, as the
“beats” are not synchronized—it is more like 1,000 toothpaste tubes
being squeezed all over your body independently.</p>
<p>*2 And funny enough, and too weird not to mention, the Lymphatic
System is your fat transportation system. It picks up food fats around
your intestines and dumps them into the bloodstream to be further
distributed.</p>
<p>*3 Before the tonsils were understood better it was standard
procedure and quite common to remove them if they got infected, or
sometimes even as a precaution. Nowadays removing them is considered
much more carefully as they do serve a purpose. Pretty amazing if you
think about it, how easily humans were on board with removing living
parts because they seemed to be annoying and not that useful.</p>
