<h4 id="vaccines-and-artificial-immunization">36 Vaccines and Artificial
Immunization</h4>
<p>As we said before, even thousands of years ago, people noticed that
getting some diseases once made a patient immune to them. But it would
take quite some time for the observations to turn into something
actionable as people began to ask themselves if it would somehow be
possible to give a mild form of a disease to a healthy person on purpose
to protect them from a more dangerous infection.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years before humanity knew about the microworld, before
anybody knew about bacteria or viruses, someone came up with the method
of variolation: The attempt to somewhat artificially induce immunity to
one of the most horrible diseases that plagued our species for thousands
of years: smallpox.</p>
<p>In today’s modern world where we are mostly being spared from
outbreaks of horribly deadly diseases, it is hard to imagine how much of
a scourge smallpox used to be until basically a minute ago, in human
history terms. Up to 30% of all the people who contracted smallpox died,
and many survivors had extensive scarring on their skin, leaving them
disfigured, while as a horrible bonus, some permanently lost their
eyesight. It was a family-destroying, life-ruining plague that our
ancestors had little safeguards against. In the twentieth century alone,
smallpox killed more than 300 million people, so the motivation to do
something about this scourge was pretty high.</p>
<p>When, exactly, the first experiments with variolation started is not
known, but it was at the very least hundreds of years ago, in medieval
China. The basic idea was pretty straightforward: Take a few scabs from
an infected person that only had a mild case of smallpox, let them dry
out, and grind them to a fine powder. Then blow the powder up the
nostril of a person you want to give immunity to. If things went well, a
mild outbreak of smallpox was the consequence in the patient, who then
subsequently gained immunity against harsh forms of the disease for the
future.</p>
<p>Although a tiny bit disgusting, in times where people had no real
recourse against diseases, this method was the best protection against
smallpox available and so it spread around the globe. Different areas of
the world practiced variolation in different ways, using needles or
small cuts to rub in scabs or pus from infected people.</p>
<p>Still, variolation was not without risk with as much as 1–2% of all
patients going through the procedure contracting a more serious version
of smallpox, with all the potentially negative consequences. But the
disease was so horrible and so widespread, for so long, that many took
on the risk for themselves and their loved ones. So the general idea of
immunization was already around for quite some time when the first
proper vaccine was developed.</p>
<p>The proper start of the history of vaccination was the realization
that it was not necessary to variolate with the actual real smallpox
disease, but much safer to use material from cowpox, which was a variant
of smallpox that affected, surprise, cows. This was a truly
revolutionary step and only a few years later, the first vaccine was
developed that would eventually lead to the total eradication of
smallpox.*1</p>
<p>As a consequence of the success of this first vaccine, more and more
vaccines were developed against different horrible diseases, such as
tetanus, measles, polio, and many more.</p>
<p>Today, vaccines provide immunity against a whole plethora of
dangerous infections by creating Memory Cells that are ready to meet a
specific pathogen in case it ever shows up for real. Unfortunately
creating memory cells is actually far from a trivial affair. As we
discussed before, your immune system is very cautious and requires very
specific signals to boot up and activate properly. To provoke the
creation of Memory Cells that stick around for years, your immune system
has to go through multiple steps of escalation, with the two-factor
authentication and all that jazz!</p>
<p>So to make a good vaccine we somehow need to safely provoke an immune
response to make the immune system think a real invasion is happening so
it makes memory cells—but without accidentally causing the disease we
want to protect ourselves against. This is much harder than it sounds
and there are a number of different ways to induce immunity in a
patient, some more permanent than others. Let us take a brief look at a
few different methods:</p>
<p>Passive Immunization—Free Fish</p>
<p>Imagine you found yourself in Australia, a country where people are
very nice and talk funny but basically everything else is a deadly
venomous animal trying to kill you.*2</p>
<p>Now imagine you continue to show bad judgment and take a guided tour
through the bush to experience nature and all that. You admire the
wonderful landscape and your mind wanders off, paying less and less
attention to your surroundings, when it suddenly happens—spooked by the
equally unalert members of the tour that walked before you, a very
unhappy and stressed-out snake decides to defend itself before one of
the loud apes steps on it and quickly bites you in your ankle.</p>
<p>The pain is sharp and immediately your ankle swells and hurts
horribly, which you communicate to the rest of the world through an
appropriate amount of screaming and cursing. You are lucky that the next
hospital is not that far away, you are being told as you lie in pain in
the backseat of a jeep, and while you might not feel lucky in such a
situation, you actually are because you are about to enjoy the wonders
of passive immunization.</p>
<p>Passive immunity is basically the process of borrowing immunity
against a disease or a pathogen from someone who survived something.
Since we can’t easily borrow immune cells, as your immune system would
immediately recognize them as other and attack and kill them, we are
talking about antibodies here. How does this work in the case of a snake
bite that comes with horrible venom?</p>
<p>First of all, an aspect of antibodies that we did not discuss yet is
that they don’t just work against pathogens but also against their
toxins. In the small world, a toxic substance is nothing more than a
molecule that disrupts natural processes or causes damage by destroying
or dissolving structures. Antibodies can neutralize these molecules by
binding to them with their pincers and rendering them harmless.</p>
<p>So when a venomous snake bites you it directly injects you with a
huge amount of harmful molecules. If we assume this is not a deadly
snake that would kill you quickly, the immune processes we have learned
about would be triggered. The damage and the death among civilian cells
caused by the venom triggers inflammation and activates Dendritic Cells,
which will ultimately lead to B Cells producing protective antibodies
against this specific venom.</p>
<p>Think about how cool that is—the immune system is so powerful that it
can produce answers to the most dangerous venoms in nature. Although in
reality the bites of venomous animals are so dangerous because the
damage their toxins cause is pretty much instant and only gets worse. In
many cases waiting for a week until the adaptive immune system has done
its thing is not an option because death will stop this process before
it is finished.</p>
<p>So to basically cheat the system humans began producing
antivenoms—which are nothing more than purified antibodies against the
venom molecules that can be injected into the system of a person that
got bitten!</p>
<p>The way these antibodies are made is pretty curious—venom is first
harvested from a snake and then injected into mammals, like horses or
rabbits, in a dose they can handle without dying. The dose is slowly
increased over time so they have a chance to develop immunity against
it—which means that they produce a large number of specific antibodies
against the venom that saturate their blood and make them immune. This
blood is then harvested and the antibodies are filtered from all the
other animal blood components. Voila, you have an antivenom ready to be
injected into a human that got bitten. As you may imagine this process
is not entirely without risk—the human immune system can still react if
there are too many animal proteins left. But usually the risk of an
adverse reaction to the antivenom is dwarfed by the risk and damage from
the venom itself and so it is usually administered if possible.*3</p>
<p>Passive immunization also occurs naturally during pregnancy, when
certain antibodies can pass through the placenta and enter a fetus to
give it the protection of its mother.</p>
<p>What is even more interesting is that once a baby is born, large
quantities of antibodies are passed on via human breast milk.</p>
<p>The process of harvesting antibodies can also straight up be done
artificially from human to human—for example, in a therapy called IGIV,
for “ImmunoGlobulin IntraVascular” administration, Antibodies are
collected from donated blood at blood banks, pooled together, and
carefully infused into patients that suffer from immune disorders and
are unable to produce Antibodies themselves.</p>
<p>The annoying thing about passive immunization is that it is
temporary. If you administer Antibodies to someone, they will stay
protected as long as the Antibodies are around. But this protective
effect goes away as the Antibodies are either used up or decay through
natural processes. So as great as passive immunization is, it is not the
best way to create immunity for most people.</p>
<p>It is the equivalent of giving a hungry man a fish, instead of
teaching him how to fish. To really actively create immunity in people,
we need to stimulate the immune system to create immunity by itself!</p>
<p>Active Immunization—Learning how to Fish</p>
<p>If you have read this far in the book you already know what active
immunization is doing in your body: It creates Memory Cells that keep
weapons against a specific pathogen ready.</p>
<p>Natural active immunization is what we explained in this book so
far—for example, you get influenza A and you become immune against that
specific strain forever. But this natural way has a bunch of downsides,
mainly that you need to suffer through the disease to become immune to
it. So the solution seems easy, all we need to do is to trick the body
into thinking it is sick to become immune against all sorts of
diseases!</p>
<p>But, of course, it is easier said than done. Because your immune
system is very cautious and requires very specific signals to boot up
and activate properly. To artificially induce the creation of Memory
Cells that stick around for years, we need to activate your immune
system for real. And this means it has to go through the proper steps of
escalation. Two-factor authentication and all of that jazz.</p>
<p>So we must somehow safely provoke a proper immune response but avoid
causing the actual disease we want to protect ourselves against. There
are a few different ways to do this.</p>
<p>The first method basically comes back to the original principle of
variolation. What if we could sort of cause the disease we want to
immunize against, but just a really, really weak version of it? This is
the principle of live-attenuated vaccines, where we put the real thing
into our bodies, but a weak version of it.</p>
<p>The original pathogen, like a chicken pox, measles, or mumps virus,
is artificially made into a pathetic shadow of itself in a laboratory.
This works especially well with viruses because, in contrast to
pathogens like bacteria, they are just really simple creatures with only
a handful of genes, making it easier to control how well they work. The
mechanism of how live viruses are weakened is pretty interesting because
it is literally using evolution. A little bit how the ancestors of dogs
used to be majestic and powerful wolves that we turned into pugs and
Italian greyhounds.</p>
<p>In the case of the measles virus, for example, the virus that we use
for vaccines today was isolated from a kid in the 1950s. It was cultured
over and over and over again in tissue samples in a lab until it was
tamed. The measles virus that had been domesticated this way is only a
shadow of its former self: Weak and harmless and a pathetic version of
its wild distant cousin. It still can grow and multiply but it is unable
to cause a proper measles outbreak, while it still is provoking the same
strong immune response as a real and dangerous measles infection
would.</p>
<p>It can cause very mild symptoms, like a bit of fever for example, or
in rare cases a sort of very mild version of a rash, again similar to
the variolation experiments hundreds of years ago. One to two rounds of
this vaccine are enough to create enough memory cells in kids to protect
them for the rest of their lives!</p>
<p>Live vaccines come with downsides of course—for example, they have to
be stored at the proper temperatures so the weak pathogens don’t die
before they can be administered. And they can’t be used on people that
are severely immunocompromised, as they do not have the tools to fight
even weak infections. For the vast majority of people this sort of
vaccination is a safe and effective way to artificially upgrade their
immune system and protect them against the target of the vaccine for the
remainder of their lives.</p>
<p>Using living pathogens is not always an option though. Just like you
can’t domesticate great white sharks, some pathogens refuse to be tamed
and become properly weak. In some cases the risk of them causing the
disease we want to protect against is just too high. So another method
is to straight up kill the pathogen before injecting it, which is called
an inactivated vaccine.</p>
<p>You get a high number of the pathogenic bacteria or viruses together
and then you destroy them with chemicals, heat, or even radiation. The
goal is to destroy their genetic code so they are empty and dead husks,
unable to reproduce and go through their life cycles. But this also
creates a problem. Can you imagine what?</p>
<p>They are too harmless now! Your immune system will not be properly
provoked by a bunch of carcasses of pathogens that just float around and
are pretty dead. So the dead remains of the pathogens have to be mixed
with chemicals that highly activate the immune system. You can imagine
these chemicals like insults that provoke a disproportionate response,
like running around wearing the jersey of the opposing team and
insulting the home team in a city that just has lost a major sporting
event. Chances are at some point someone will punch you in the face.</p>
<p>If dead bacteria are mixed with substances that really put the immune
system on edge, your immune cells will not be able to make the
distinction but order the creation of memory cells. Unfortunately a
number of people who don’t understand chemistry have deducted from this
that vaccines are filled with poison, which could not be further from
the truth. For one, the doses of these chemicals are laughably small and
usually only able to create a local reaction. And without them, the
vaccine would not work. Another upside for this kind of vaccine is that
it is much more stable and easy to store and transport than live
vaccines!</p>
<p>Going one step further than just killing a pathogen are subunit
vaccines. Instead of injecting a whole pathogen, only subunits, or in
other words, certain parts (antigens) of the pathogen, are used so they
can more easily be recognized by T and B Cells—which is a very secure
way of vaccinating, as it massively decreases the likelihood of an
adverse reaction to the pathogen. (This is because sometimes it is not
the pathogen directly who causes harm but their metabolic products,
which is a nice way of saying “bacteria poop.”)</p>
<p>The process of making these subunits is highly interesting as it
includes a tiny bit of simple genetic engineering. In the case of the
hepatitis B vaccine, parts of the virus DNA are implanted into a yeast
cell. The yeast cell then produces massive amounts of virus antigen that
they display on their outside where it can be harvested. This way we can
create highly specific parts of a pathogen and point the immune system
towards it with a lot of precision! Just like other inactivated
vaccines, the antigens need to be mixed with insulting chemicals that
make your immune system think they are dangerous.</p>
<p>And lastly, let us mention the newest type of vaccine, the mRNA
vaccines. The basic principle here is pretty genius, it is basically
making our own cells produce antigens that the immune system can then
pick up. Remember mRNA, the molecule that tells the protein production
facilities in your cells what proteins to make? Basically, you inject
someone with mRNA that will make a few of your cells make viral
antigens, which the cell then showcases to the immune system. The immune
system is pretty alarmed by this and will create defenses against this
antigen.</p>
<p>There are more subtypes of vaccines but for this book these are
enough details. Despite the fact that vaccines protect us from some of
the worst diseases humanity has suffered from, more and more people have
stopped vaccinating their children.</p>
<p>The reasons for the anti-vaccine movements mistrusting vaccines are
diverse, but in the United States and Europe the belief that the risks
of vaccines outweigh their benefits is especially prevalent. That
vaccines are an artificial intervention into natural processes and that
it is less dangerous to let nature run its course.</p>
<p>If you understand the mechanisms of the immune system and how
immunity is created, this idea quickly loses all power because vaccines
and diseases both do the same thing: They create Memory Cells by
triggering an immune reaction. But while pathogens do this by attacking
the body and causing a huge amount of stress, which carries the very
real risks of various long-term consequences including death, vaccines
arrive at the same goal, without all the risks of diseases.</p>
<p>Let us think about this in a different way. Imagine you wanted to
send your kids into a dojo where they can learn some self-defense so
they are prepared if someone wants to rob them. In your city there are
two dojos so you arrange to visit both of them and look at the training
methods. The first is “Nature Dojo.” The philosophy of the head trainer
is that kids should train with real weapons, real knives and swords, so
they are better prepared for the real dangers of the world. After all,
it is more natural and real life just is dangerous. From time to time a
student will get a deep cut and require stitches. And yeah, OK, there
may be a lost eye and sometimes a kid may die. But this is the natural
way!</p>
<p>The second Dojo is called “Vaccine Dojo,” and here the curriculum and
exercises are basically the same as in “Nature Dojo,” with one major
difference. The kids use weapons made from foam and paper. Are there
injuries? Well yes, very seldomly, but much, much less frequently and
usually they are small bruises not even worth any tears. Which dojo
would you choose for your kids, if you had to take one of them?</p>
<p>Let’s be real, nothing in life is entirely without risk—but we can
make educated decisions that are less risky and more likely to avoid
damage. And in the case of vaccines, if you don’t make a decision your
kids are automatically enrolled in “Nature Dojo.”</p>
<p>On top of everything else, vaccination is a sort of social contract
that has benefits for all of us. If everyone that is healthy enough gets
a vaccine for a disease, we are creating herd immunity, and are
protecting everyone who is not able to. There are a number of reasons
why some people can’t get vaccinated. Maybe they are too young, maybe
they suffer from an immunodeficiency that makes them unable to create
memory cells, maybe they are currently being treated for cancer and the
chemotherapy just destroyed their immune system.</p>
<p>Only the collective can protect these people from the diseases we
vaccinate against. Herd immunity basically means that we immunize enough
people against a disease so that it can’t spread and dies before it
reaches its victims. The problem is, for that to work we need to
actually vaccinate enough people—for measles, for example, 95% of the
people need to be vaccinated to create efficient herd immunity.</p>
<p>OK, we basically covered the most important parts of your immune
system! You got to know your soldier cells, your intelligence networks,
special organs, protein armies, specialized superweapons, and the
mechanisms of how they work together! Now that this stuff is covered we
have an opportunity to see what happens when all of these great systems
fall apart. What happens when a pathogen interferes with your T Cells,
what if your immune cells are fighting way too hard and begin hurting
you from the inside, what can you do to boost your immune system, and
how is it protecting you against cancer?</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 While this may sound easy and straightforward, it wasn’t. It still
took a worldwide vaccination program and over 200 years to finally bring
smallpox to its knees. To this day, smallpox remains the first and sadly
only human pathogen that humanity has wiped out completely. Smallpox no
longer occurs in the wild and only remains (hopefully) safely stored in
two labs, one in the United States and one in Russia.</p>
<p>*2 The chances of your dying through a snakebite in Australia are
actually pretty low. Only around 3,000 people are bitten by snakes each
year, and on average two of these die. Still, the amount of venomous
critters on this continent is way too high and no amount of real-world
statistics will convince me otherwise.</p>
<p>*3 Are you ready for something really cool that is also really bad?
With everything that we have learned about proteins and antigens and all
that, how is it possible that your immune system is cool with getting
antibodies from an entirely different species? Well fun fact, it is not
cool with that but actually really indignant about the sudden flood of
horse or bunny protein. So while the antivenom will work fine the first
time, the second time you might be immune to it because your body might
make antibodies against the antibodies from a horse or bunny. This is
one of the cases where the immune system just could not have expected
that modern medicine would come up with creative solutions like pumping
venom into a horse and then using its blood for ourselves. Which is fair
so we can’t really be annoyed too much with our immune system in that
case.</p>
<p>Part 4</p>
<p>Rebellion and Civil War</p>
<p>37 When Your Immune System Is Too Weak: HIV and AIDS</p>
<p>The Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, is a really terrifying but
fascinating example to showcase what happens when your immune system
breaks down. Actually, it’s not even your whole immune system, just a
very particular cell. The main victims of the virus are your Helper T
Cells. Yes, all the horror of HIV and AIDS is because it knocks your
Helper T Cells out. If you read this far you probably understand how
important this cell is and how much of your defense relies on them.</p>
<p>As a species we are incredibly lucky that HIV is not super easy to
contract. It doesn’t float through the air or live on surfaces but
requires bodily fluids like blood or intense contact like sexual
intercourse. Most HIV infections happen through sexual contact, through
small unnoticeable injuries, where the virus passes through the
defensive layers of epithelial cells.</p>
<p>HIV enters your cells via specific receptors called “CD4” that are
found on the surfaces of Helper T Cells and to a lesser extent
Macrophages and Dendritic Cells. HIV is a retrovirus which means that it
intrudes and merges with your genetic code, your most intimate
expression of your individuality. In a sense HIV becomes a part of you
forever. But a corrupt version of you.</p>
<p>The human genome project found the genetic remains, living fossils,
of thousands of viruses in our DNA, comprising up to 8% of our genetic
code. So in a sense you are 8% virus. Most of that genetic code is
useless and probably doesn’t harm us. But it shows that when a
retrovirus infects you, it is here to stay.</p>
<p>Do you remember our virus metaphor with the silent soldiers that kill
citizens in their sleep? HIV is like a soldier killing their victim but
then flaying their corpse and wearing the skin as a costume to walk
around the city during the daytime.</p>
<p>HIV infections move forward in three stages:</p>
<p>The first stage is the acute phase. It is thought that Dendritic
Cells are among the first cells that HIV infects and takes over. Which
is great for the virus, because the Dendritic Cell will do its job,
which means carry HIV to the place in your body where the cells hang out
that it is looking for: The T Cell dating areas in your lymph node
megacities.</p>
<p>Once the infected Dendritic Cell arrives here, HIV has easy access to
countless T Helper Cells. So HIV really acts like a sleeper agent
wearing the skin of its victims to invade the headquarters of an enemy
country.</p>
<p>Once the virus gains access to its favorite victims, the number of
viruses explodes. Early on in the HIV infection, the virus multiplies
pretty much unchecked, while the innate immune system unsuccessfully
tries to slow down this process. During this phase your body reacts to
HIV like it does to all viruses, using the regular mechanisms and
weapons, activating the adaptive system—and this is when you first might
notice the infection.</p>
<p>The earliest symptoms of HIV are not that well described because
usually the diagnosis does not happen until weeks, months, or even years
after the infection. What we know is that HIV infections begin very
mildly with symptoms of a harmless cold. A general feeling of fatigue,
maybe a sore throat and a low fever. Symptoms like everyone experiences
a few times a year, nothing you really react to strongly. It is just not
a big deal.</p>
<p>At some point, enough Killer T Cells and Plasma Cells will be
activated and devastate the virus, killing infected cells left and right
and eradicating billions of viruses. Your symptoms disappear and you
might think the mild cold you have is over. For most regular virus
infections, this is it. Sterilization occurs as all viruses are wiped
out and Memory T and B Cells are now in place to protect you from this
virus for years, if not forever. And if you are really lucky this might
happen in extremely rare cases of HIV infections too.</p>
<p>But usually with HIV this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Now the chronic phase of the infection begins. Most types of viruses
would not survive the onslaught of the immune system—but HIV has many
extraordinary methods to survive: First of all, the virus does not
spread just by making many copies of itself until the cell bursts—it is
much more careful and works to keep its victims alive as long as
possible.</p>
<p>Second, it has a few extra-sneaky ways of finding new victims. In
Cell-to-Cell Spread, the virus can be transmitted from one cell directly
to another one. Here, HIV makes use of an important mechanism of your
immune cells: Immunological synapses. When immune cells interact
directly to activate each other, they sort of bash their faces together
and lick each other’s cheeks. Which means, getting very close and
touching each other with many short extensions, called pseudopodia. It
looks a bit funny, like many short fingers reaching out of the
cells—this is the way many immune cells check each other’s receptors.
And these interactions can get hijacked by HIV—it uses this close
connection to jump from one cell to another.</p>
<p>This has many upsides. The virus doesn’t need to kill a cell, which
would make it burst and release urgent alarm signals that make the
immune system angry and alert. It doesn’t require a large number of
viruses floating around outside of cells, which could be picked up and
cause alarm. And it has a very high success rate to infect another
victim compared to the floating-around-randomly strategy that most
viruses employ. This way, HIV uses interactions between cells and jumps
from infected Helper T Cells to Killer T Cells, from Dendritic Cells to
T Cells, from T Cells to Macrophages.</p>
<p>And last but not least, HIV can hide very efficiently this way. Even
if the immune system flares up and kills most of the infected cells from
time to time, the virus only has to sit idle in a few cells inside a
lymph node to be carried around your whole body again, always in close
vicinity to all the cells it wants to get close to! This also makes it
much harder for medication and therapies to get rid of HIV because it
has many different avenues to spread between its target cells.</p>
<p>HIV also can lie dormant and do nothing in cells for long periods of
time waiting for the right time to become active. When a cell does not
multiply, its protein production is in a sort of slow mode, aimed only
at sustaining the cell—but when a cell proliferates, these production
machineries amplify thousandfolds.</p>
<p>So when an infected Helper T Cell begins to multiply, HIV awakens and
makes thousands of new viruses within hours. This is so effective that
even if Killer T Cells are around looking for it, the virus is able to
produce a lot of new viruses without being caught and to infect a lot of
new cells.</p>
<p>We spoke before about the huge challenge that microorganisms present
to the Immune System because of one core ability: They can change and
adapt much quicker than multicellular beings and therefore we need our
Adaptive Immune System to stand a chance. What makes HIV so incredibly
dangerous is that it operates on a completely different level in terms
of genetic variability. The genetic code of HIV is extremely prone to
copying errors—on average, every time the virus makes a copy of itself
it makes an error. Which means even in a single cell there are numerous
different variants of HIV.</p>
<p>This has three possible outcomes: 1. HIV destroys itself because it
mutates in a way that disables itself or it becomes less effective. 2.
The mutation does not help or harm and nothing changes. 3. The virus
becomes better at avoiding the defenses of the immune system.</p>
<p>When you are infected, HIV can produce about ten billion new HIV
viruses in a single day—so by pure chance, a lot of viruses will be
produced that are actually better at keeping the infection going. Worse
still, cells can be infected simultaneously by multiple different
strains of HIV, and these strains can be recombined into new hybrids. If
you can try out billions of new versions every single day, chances are
really good that a few of the new viruses are great at avoiding the
immune response.</p>
<p>Now think about what this means: It took the Adaptive Immune System
about a week to make thousands of Killer T Cells and millions of
antibodies that are extremely good at hunting HIV down—but already there
are numerous new viruses that have new and different antigens! Different
enough that the Killer Cells and Antibodies you just made may be useless
against them.</p>
<p>And now the new and different viruses infect new cells and make
millions of copies of themselves, again. For them, the virus your
Adaptive Immune System adapted to is already old news and irrelevant.
HIV is always a step ahead of the immune system. And so in the chronic
phase of an HIV infection your body is still teeming with the virus. On
average, in this phase, a single milliliter of blood contains between
1,000 and 100,000 virus particles.</p>
<p>So let us summarize the tactic of HIV real quick before we move on:
By infecting Dendritic Cells, the virus gets a taxi into HIV heaven: The
lymph nodes, which are filled top to bottom with Helper T Cells. HIV can
build reservoirs in these cells and stay hidden indefinitely. When
Helper T Cells begin to proliferate massively, they do so at lymph
nodes, which is the ideal place for HIV to also make millions of new
viruses. So the place that is most central to building protection
against viruses is completely taken over and actually becomes a weak
point.</p>
<p>This is still not the worst part. Think about what HIV really does by
specifically attacking T Cells: It destroys and kills the cells that the
Adaptive Immune System needs to properly activate B Cells and Killer T
Cells.</p>
<p>Still your Immune System does not give up. An epic struggle begins
that will go on for years. Every day, HIV makes billions of new viruses
and your immune system reacts in kind with new antibodies and new Killer
T Cells. A push and pull of death and rebirth, a struggle for survival
on both sides. This struggle can take up to ten or more years and
usually comes with very few noticeable side effects—which in a perverse
twist enables an infected person to serve as a reservoir and infect
others.</p>
<p>And although your immune system is giving its all, the cards are
stacked against you. Not only are your Helper T Cells constantly being
infected by HIV, Killer T Cells viciously hunt them down too. (That is
because, if your Helper T Cells show HIV antigens in their display
windows, Killer T Cells will order them to kill themselves!) Which is
good in principle but also means that the weapons you need against HIV
are getting exhausted.</p>
<p>But not just the Helper T Cells, Dendritic Cells suffer too—and they
are just as important to activate the immune system. Without these two
cells, the ability of the Adaptive Immune System to mobilize begins to
break down. This dying goes on for years as the body desperately
produces new Helper T Cells—but over the long term it just can’t keep
up. As the years pass, the total amount of Helper T Cells is slowly
getting lower and lower and lower. Until one day a critical threshold is
reached and the Adaptive Immune System collapses. The amount of virus
particles in the blood explodes and saturates the body as there is only
extremely little resistance left.</p>
<p>The last stage begins: profound immunosuppression. AIDS, the Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome, begins. What this means is that your
Adaptive Immune System is basically out of order, which demonstrates how
tremendously important it is. Hundreds of pathogens, microorganisms, and
cancers that are usually not the slightest problem for your body now
quickly become dangerous and lethal. But not only are you now extremely
susceptible to countless diseases from the outside. Because to fight
cancer, you need your Adaptive Immune System, Helper and Killer T Cells
in particular, cancer now can thrive with very little opposition. If
AIDS breaks out the situation quickly becomes dire and dangerous. The
leading causes of death are various forms of cancer and bacterial or
viral infections, often a combination of all three. Basically everything
your immune system usually protects you against.</p>
<p>HIV infections used to be a death sentence, with the disease marching
towards an eventual outbreak of AIDS that was soon followed by death.
But thanks to an immense and unparalleled effort of the scientific and
medical community, for people receiving proper treatment, HIV has turned
into a chronic disease that is manageable. Almost all therapies for HIV
are targeted at preventing the last stage—to prevent AIDS from ever
breaking out, because this is where people die.*</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>A natural question at this point is how HIV treatments work. Well,
without going into too much detail, the mechanisms are more or less that
the different stages of virus development are targeted and blocked or
slowed down, so the HIV infection can never turn into AIDS. The more
interesting question, though, is why don’t we have working medicine
against the flu but we do have a few different treatments against HIV?
(Well OK, we actually do have a very safe and effective vaccine against
the flu, which is redeveloped each year to account for the rapid
mutation of the flu virus. It is just that for some reason not that many
people get flu shots.) OK. The answer is a bit depressing: Attention and
money. It is easy to forget that HIV used to be a new pandemic once and
a very shocking and scary one. In 2019 there were still around
thirty-eight million infected people around the world. When HIV and AIDS
emerged it caused panic in the establishment, leading to an outpouring
of resources and attention that was unprecedented. Humanity really
wanted to get results, fast (as a happy byproduct, immunologists learned
a lot of new things about the immune system). And we got them, and
turned HIV from deadly to a chronic disease and may even slay it for
good one day. Similar things could be observed with the vaccines for
COVID-19, which broke even the best speed record. In the end it really
seems to be a question of what is a cure worth to us and how desperately
do we want it. Another testament to the fact that humans really could
solve all of their major problems if they were better at
prioritizing.</li>

<p>38 When the Immune System Is Too Aggressive: Allergies</p>
<p>Your whole life crabs were among your favorite foods, these
funny-looking giant spiders crawling around on the bottom of the ocean,
with their weird texture and great taste. After being good and dieting
for a few months, today was supposed to be a night of indulgence with
your friends, wine, and a lot of crabs. But soon after your first bite
something weird happened. Your body began feeling funny, a little bit on
edge.</p>
<p>You felt hot and began to sweat, your ears, face, and hands felt
weird, and suddenly you noticed that breathing got harder and you
panicked a bit. Your friends asked if you were OK as you got up but had
to sit down immediately because you felt so dizzy. And then you woke up
in an ambulance racing to the hospital, a needle in your arm dripping
chemicals into your system, which calmed down the allergic reaction that
almost killed you. You are confused but also relieved to be in the care
of professionals, when a sudden realization hits you: You will never be
able to eat crabs again.*1</p>
<p>As we have seen numerous times in the book, the immune system walks a
very tight line. If it doesn’t react strongly enough even smaller
infections could turn into deadly diseases quickly and kill you. But if
it reacts too strongly then it can do more damage than any
infection—your immune system is much more dangerous to your survival
than any pathogen ever could be. Think of Ebola, even this pretty
disgusting and horrible disease needs about six days to kill you. Your
immune system has the power to kill you in about fifteen minutes. People
who suffer from allergies have experience with this dark side of their
defense network. When your immune system loses its self-composure, it
becomes deadly, killing a few thousand people by anaphylactic shock each
day. Why would your immune system do something like that?</p>
<p>Being allergic means that the immune system massively overreacts to
something that might not be all that dangerous. It means that it
mobilizes forces and prepares to fight, although there is no real threat
present. About one in five people in the West suffer from some form of
allergy—most commonly immediate hypersensitivity, which means that
symptoms are triggered very quickly, within minutes of being exposed. It
is a little bit like finding a bug in your living room and calling the
military to wipe out your city with tactical nuclear weapons. Sure—this
deals with the bug but maybe it is not necessary to turn your house into
a glowing pile of rubble to do that. The most common immediate
hypersensitivity reactions in the developed world are hay fever, asthma,
and food allergies, with various degrees of seriousness. You can be
allergic to basically everything.</p>
<p>Some people are allergic to latex and can wear neither latex gloves
nor full-body latex suits (which is a real tragedy if they are into
that). Others are allergic to the stings from certain insects, from bees
to ticks. There is a diverse set of food allergies and of course you can
be allergic to any kind of drug.</p>
<p>What your immune system is reacting to are antigens, the molecules of
harmless substances. In the context of allergies, antigens are called
allergens, although they are functionally the same: A short piece of
protein, say from crabmeat, that can be recognized by your adaptive
immune cells and antibodies and that causes allergy is an allergen.</p>
<p>Why does your immune system think any of this is a good idea? Well,
it doesn’t. It doesn’t think or do anything with purpose, there are just
mechanisms that misfire horribly. In this case, the source of your
immediate hypersensitive reaction is in your blood. Here the most
annoying part of your whole immune system does its thing: The IgE
Antibody. You can thank the IgE Antibody for a lot of your
allergy-related suffering. (They actually have an important job they
don’t get to do as much nowadays, but more on that in the next
chapter.)</p>
<p>IgE is produced by specialized B Cells that tend not to be stationed
in your lymph nodes, but in your skin, lungs, and intestines: Where they
can do the most damage—presumably to enemies that might overcome the
walls of your defenses—but in reality mostly to you. What do IgE
Antibodies actually do when you suffer from an allergic reaction?</p>
<p>Hypersensitivity always happens in two steps: First you need to
encounter your new mortal enemy. And then you have to meet them
again.</p>
<p>Say, for example, you eat a meal like crabs or peanuts or get stung
by a bee. The first time, all is good. The allergen floods your system
and for some reason, B Cells that are able to bind to them with their
receptors are activated. They begin making IgE Antibodies against the
allergen, like for example, crabmeat proteins, but for now things are
chill, nothing happens. You can imagine this step as arming the bomb.
(In cases like our poor protagonist at the beginning of this chapter it
is unclear when and why exactly this arming occurred—but it has to occur
at some point.)*2</p>
<p>Now, after the exposure to the crabmeat, a lot of IgE Antibodies that
are able to attach to the crabmeat allergen are in your system. But IgE
Antibodies by themselves would not be problematic as they are not
particularly long-lived and dissolve after a few days. They need help to
become a problem from a special cell in your skin, lungs, and intestines
that is especially receptive to IgE Antibodies: the Mast Cell.</p>
<p>We met it briefly before when we talked about inflammation. To
refresh your memory, Mast Cells are large, bloated monsters filled with
tiny bombs that carry extremely potent chemicals like histamine that
cause rapid and massive inflammation. The job of the Mast Cell is still
debated by scientists—some think it is crucial to early immune defenses
and others give it more of a secondary role. What we know for sure is
that Mast Cells serve as inflammation superchargers. And unfortunately,
they do their job with a bit too much enthusiasm in the case of allergic
reactions.</p>
<p>Mast Cells have receptors that connect and attach to the butt regions
of IgE Antibodies. So if IgE is produced after your first exposure to an
allergen, Mast Cells swoop them up like a large magnet would swoop up a
bunch of nails. So you can imagine a “charged and armed” Mast Cell as a
big magnet, covered with thousands of tiny spikes. When allergens pass
by, the IgE Antibodies on the Mast Cell can extremely easily connect to
them. To make matters worse, IgE on Mast Cells is stable for weeks or
even months—the connection protects them from decay. So, after your
initial exposure to an allergen, you have these bombs in your skin, your
lungs, or your gut, ready to get activated very quickly. Time passes and
nothing happens, until you finally eat a bunch of crabmeat again and
flood your system with the allergen enabling the Mast Cells covered in
IgE to connect to it. Now the armed allergy bomb goes off inside your
body.</p>
<p>Your armed Mast Cells undergo degranulation, which is a nice way of
saying that they vomit out all of their chemicals that are inflammatory
superchargers, especially histamine. This causes virtually all of the
very unpleasant things that you experience during an allergic reaction:
It tells the blood vessels to contract and let fluid stream into the
tissue, causing redness, heat and swelling, itching, and a general
feeling of unwellness.</p>
<p>If this happens in too many regions of the body at the same time, it
can lead to a dangerous loss of blood pressure, which can be deadly on
its own. Histamine also stimulates the cells that produce and secrete
mucus to step up their game, giving you an extra, unnecessary flow of
snot and slime in your respiratory system.</p>
<p>But most dangerously, histamine can cause the smooth muscles in your
lung to contract and make breathing hard or even impossible. It is not
so much that you can’t get air in, it is more that the air inside your
lung is trapped and getting it out again becomes really hard. All the
extra slime your mucous membranes produce is definitely not helping this
situation. As there are a lot of Mast Cells in the lungs, allergic
reactions that happen here can become dangerous very quickly, as extra
fluid and mucus fill up the lung, while it becomes harder and harder to
actually breathe. The worst case can be an anaphylactic shock, which can
kill within a few minutes. Allergic reactions are no joke.</p>
<p>We have given the Mast Cell a bad rap in the last few paragraphs but
this is slightly unfair. Because it does not cause all of this mess
alone, it has an equally harmful buddy. Once Mast Cells activate and
degranulate, they also release cytokines that call for allergy
reinforcements by another special cell:</p>
<p>The Basophil. Basophils patrol the body in the blood until they get
called in. They also have receptors for IgE that they charge up after
the initial exposure to the antigen. Basophils serve as a sort of second
wave of horribleness. Once Mast Cells have caused the first wave of
allergic reactions, they need to replenish their destructive histamine
bombs and are temporarily out of order. Basophils fill that gap and make
sure that the allergic reaction doesn’t stop too quickly. They are
probably really proud of themselves too, thinking that they are doing
important work, innocently setting the body on fire while you are
scratching your skin or emptying your inflamed bowels. These two cells
are responsible for the immediate hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>But unfortunately this is still not the end of it. As many sufferers
of asthma sorrowfully know, some allergic reactions are more of a
chronic occurrence than a onetime event that ends. Let us meet the third
(and luckily last) cell that thinks allergic reactions are such a great
idea!</p>
<p>The Eosinophil makes sure that the symptoms of an allergic reaction
stay around for a while—only a few of them exist inside your body and
they tend to hang out in the bone marrow, far away from the action.
Cytokines released by Mast Cells and Basophils activate them but they
take their sweet time, proliferating and cloning themselves for a while
before they arrive late to the party, where they unfortunately repeat
the mistakes made before and cause inflammation and misery. You may
rightfully ask now: Why do your own immune cells do this?</p>
<p>The truth is we don’t know yet why some people produce a lot of IgE
Antibodies when they come in contact with certain allergens and others
don’t. But while we don’t know for sure why some people are more
affected than others, we think we know what IgE Antibodies were
originally supposed to do:</p>
<p>They are the immune system’s superweapons against large parasites
that are too big for your phagocytes, your Macrophages, and your
Neutrophils to swallow. Especially one of the most horrible parasites:
Parasitic worms. A menace humanity has had to deal with for millions of
years. Let us learn about the true purpose of IgE Antibodies and at
least somewhat clear their bad name a bit.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 It is very likely that a few people reading these pages had an
experience at least somewhat similar. Quite a few more will have
unpleasant but not directly life-threatening experiences. Shellfish is
the most common food allergy that adults can suddenly gain but there are
a lot of different things that you can become suddenly allergic to, from
milk to nuts, soy, sesame, eggs, or wheat. Allergies suck.</p>
<p>*2 Urgh. OK, time for a big BUT. So what we are describing here is
the “standard” case of how allergies work. You encounter an allergen for
the first time, your immune system charges up, you encounter it a second
time, and boom, allergic reaction. But what about stories like our
introduction, with the poor person suddenly no longer able to enjoy
their favorite ocean spider dish? Well, here is a fun fact: We don’t
exactly understand this yet. Adult-onset allergies are a bit of a
mystery, which is a bit frightening considering how many people
encounter them in their lives. I myself had the joy of being rushed to a
hospital with a new surprise allergy to something I had eaten for years,
so I’d very much like to know how this works. But yeah, you now have to
live with the information that people can just suddenly become allergic
to things they ate all their lives with no warning.</p>
