<h4 id="the-murder-specialistskiller-t-cells">31 The Murder
Specialists—Killer T Cells</h4>
<p>Killer T Cells are the siblings of Helper T Cells but their job is
very different. If the Helper T Cell is the careful planner that makes
smart decisions and shines through its ability to organize, the Killer T
Cell is a dude with a hammer that bashes heads in while laughing
maniacally. “Killer” T Cell is a perfect name considering what it does:
It kills, efficiently, fast, and without mercy.</p>
<p>Around 40% of the T Cells in your body are Killer T Cells and, just
like their Helper T Cell siblings, Killer T Cells come with billions of
possible different and unique receptors for all sorts of possible
antigens. They too have to pass the education of the Murder University
of the Thymus before they are allowed to enter general circulation.</p>
<p>Just like the Helper T Cells need hot dog buns to recognize antigens
(MHC class II molecules), Killer T Cells depend on the display windows
(MHC class I molecules) to get activated.</p>
<p>So how would this work in our influenza A infection?</p>
<p>Think back to the battlefield, where millions of viruses were killing
hundreds of thousands of cells. Dendritic Cells collected samples made
of the detritus and viruses floating around at the battlefield, then
they ripped them into antigens and presented them in the hot dog buns,
their MHC class II molecules. But this would activate only Helper T
Cells and not be useful for our Killer Cells. Here things become a bit
complicated because there are still a lot of open questions about the
exact mechanisms but the details are not that important right now.</p>
<p>All you need to know is that there is a thing that Dendritic Cells do
called cross-presentation, which enables them to sample virus antigens
and to present some of them in their MHC class I molecules, in their
display windows, even though they have not been infected by a virus. So
Dendritic Cells are able to activate Helper T and Killer T Cells at the
same time, by loading up hot dog buns and display windows with
antigens.*</p>
<p>You can imagine how Killer T Cell activation happens now. Dendritic
Cells covered in antigens from dead enemies that are presented neatly in
the hot dog buns and covered in virus antigens that are presented in the
display windows arrive in the lymph node and move to the T Cell dating
area. Here they look for a virgin Killer T Cell that is able to
recognize the virus antigen in its display windows.</p>
<p>These Dendritic Cells that are charged up with the snapshot of a
battlefield from a virus infection are basically able to call for three
different types of reinforcements: They activate the specific Killer T
Cells that kill infected cells, and they activate Helper T Cells that
help out at the battlefield and Helper T Cells that activate B Cells to
provide antibodies. And all that from one Dendritic Cell, which arrived
with all the intel and antigens the adaptive immune system could ever
wish for.</p>
<p>This is also important for a second reason, for to truly awaken,
Killer T Cells need a second signal. As you might imagine, Killer T
Cells are a very dangerous bunch that you wouldn’t want to activate by
accident. So similarly to B Cells, their full activation requires a
two-factor authentication. A Killer T Cell that was activated only by a
Dendritic Cell will make a few clones of itself and can fight, but it is
a little sluggish and it will kill itself rather quickly.</p>
<p>The second activation signal comes from a Helper T Cell. So this is
again the two-factor authentication we got to know with B Cells: To
truly activate the strongest weapons of your adaptive immune system both
the Innate and the Adaptive immune system need to “agree,” they both
need to give their permission.</p>
<p>Only if a Helper T Cell has been activated before by a Dendritic Cell
and then goes on to restimulate the Killer T Cell can it live up to its
full potential. When truly activated, the Killer T Cell rapidly
proliferates and makes lots and lots of clones of itself that eventually
move to the battlefield to dish out a lot of death.</p>
<p>About ten days after you caught the infection in the break room you
are still pretty sick. Your immune system has been fighting but it also
made you feel horrible in the process and the infection is still going
strong. Around this time, the Killer T Cells finally arrive in your
infected lung. They squeeze by Macrophages and dead civilian cells and
slowly and carefully move from cell to cell to scan them for infection.
They basically press their face against the face of a civilian and take
a close and deep look into the many display windows on their surface,
carefully scanning the story of the insides. If they don’t find antigens
they can connect their T Cell receptors to, nothing happens and they
move on.</p>
<p>But when a Killer T Cell finds a cell that has virus antigen in its
display window (MHC class I receptors) it immediately issues a special
command to the cell: “Kill yourself but be very clean about it.” Not
with aggression or anger, but matter-of-factly and with dignity, if you
want to anthropomorphize this process. The death of the infected cell is
a necessity, a fact of life, and it is important that it occurs
properly. This is one of the key parts in the response to virus
infections:</p>
<p>It is very important how an infected cell kills itself. If the T
Cell, for example, used just chemical weapons and threw them around,
like the way Neutrophils do it, they would rip their victim open and
make them burst. Not only would this release the cell’s guts and insides
and cause harsh inflammation reactions, it would also release all the
viruses inside the infected cell that have been made until this
point.</p>
<p>So instead, the Killer T Cell punctures the infected cell and inserts
a special death signal, that is conveying a very specific order:
Apoptosis, the controlled cell death we mentioned before already. This
way the virus particles are neatly trapped in tiny packets of cell
carcass and unable to do further damage until a hungry Macrophage passes
by and consumes the remnants of the dead cell. This process is extremely
efficient and the virus count drops harshly as thousands of Killer T
Cells move through the battlefield, checking every cell they meet for
infection, in a process that is called “serial killing.” Yes, this
really is what it is called, praise where praise is due, immunologists
nailed this term. Millions of viruses are destroyed before they get the
chance to infect more victims. But also hundreds of thousands of
infected civilian cells are ordered to kill themselves this way. No, the
immune system has no chill at all, it does what it needs to do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is a huge flaw in this system: Pathogens are not
stupid and they found ways to destroy the display windows and therefore
hide themselves from the immune system, from Killer T Cells. Many
viruses force infected cells to stop making MHC class I molecules,
effectively destroying this strategy.</p>
<p>So in this case, are you doomed?</p>
<p>Well, of course not because your ingenious defense network has an
answer, even for this case.</p>
<p>And it has one of the best names in all of immunology: Meet the
Natural Killer Cell.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Another way the Dendritic Cell can activate a Killer T Cell is by
straight up being infected by the virus itself. Just like a regular
cell, the Dendritic Cell presents samples of the virus in its MHC class
I molecules and can still tell the adaptive immune system: “Look, there
is a pathogen that infects cells, even I am infected, mobilize special
forces especially for that type of enemy.” To enhance the chance that
this happens, Dendritic Cells that sense the chemical warfare triggered
by virus infections massively produce more display windows, to become
super, extra transparent.</li>
