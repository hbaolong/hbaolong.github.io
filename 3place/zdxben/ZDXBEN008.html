<h4 id="the-cut">7 The Cut</h4>
<p>Small actions can have big consequences. Simple mistakes can lead to
catastrophic outcomes. Something mildly annoying on the scale of the
human giant is a full-blown emergency on the scale of your cells.</p>
<p>Imagine strolling through the woods on a pleasant summer day. It’s
hot and humid and you went with light and fashionable shoes instead of
your nature-proof boots because this is the woods, not the jungle, and
you are an adult and can make your own decisions! You hike up a hill
when you suddenly feel a sharp pain. You look down and see that you
stepped on a rotten board that once was nailed to a tree but has since
decided to become a death trap. A long and rusty nail penetrates the
sole of your shoe. You pull it out and curse and complain a bunch about
the world in general and your cruel fate in particular. Nobody could
have seen this coming. It doesn’t hurt too bad though. You take your
shoe and sock off to look and it’s nothing terribly serious, only a
little bit of bleeding. So you continue hiking and muttering under your
breath.</p>
<p>Meanwhile your cells had a pretty different experience. When the nail
penetrated your shoe, its tip entered your big toe. It ripped through
your skin like a pointy piece of metal would. For your cells, it was an
average day until suddenly, their world exploded. From their perspective
a large metal asteroid just ripped a hole into the world. Much worse
though, it was covered with soil and dirt and hundreds of thousands of
bacteria that suddenly found themselves beyond the gates of your
otherwise impenetrable skin border wall. And now this has become a whole
situation.</p>
<p>Immediately, bacteria spread into the warm caverns between helpless
cells, ready to consume nutrients and explore a little. This here is
much better than soil! There is food and water and it is warm and comfy
and there are only victims around that seem like helpless children. The
bacteria have no intention of leaving ever again. And the soil bacteria
are not the only unwelcome visitors. Thousands of bacteria that did
their thing on the surface of your skin and in your moist socks now also
decide to check out this paradise that has just appeared out of nowhere.
What a great and lucky day!</p>
<p>Your body politely disagrees with this assessment. Hundreds of
thousands of civilian cells have died, ripped apart by the foreign
object that so suddenly crashed through the sky. Others are wounded and
distressed. And similar to a catastrophe on the human scale, the
civilians are screaming in terror, sending messages of alarm and panic
to everyone ready to receive them. These panic signals, the guts of dead
cells, and the stench of thousands of bacteria are carried into the
surrounding tissue, raising an urgent alarm.</p>
<p>Your Innate Immune System reacts immediately. Sentinel cells are the
very first to show up—they were peacefully patrolling the premises when
the impact happened and are quickly making their way right to ground
zero, attracted by the screams and the detritus of the crash site. These
cells are called Macrophages and they are the largest immune cells your
body has to offer. Physically, Macrophages are pretty impressive. If an
average cell would be the size of a human, a Macrophage would be the
size of a black rhino. And just as with black rhinos, you better not
mess with them. Their purpose is to devour dead cells and living
enemies, coordinate defenses, and help heal wounds. Jobs that are in
high demand, because right now determined bacteria are proliferating
rapidly—they need to be stopped quickly before they can establish a real
presence.</p>
<p>The chaos puts the Macrophages into a rage they have never
experienced before. Within seconds, they engage the bacteria in battle
and throw their own bodies violently at them—imagine a wild rhino trying
to stamp panicked bunnies to death. But the bunnies, obviously, prefer
not to be stamped to death and so they flee and try to escape the grasp
of this powerful cell. But their escape plan will be in vain, as
Macrophages are able to stretch out parts of themselves, a bit like the
arms of an octopus, guided only by the smell of the panicked bacteria.
When they manage to grab one of them, its fate is sealed. The grip of a
Macrophage is too strong, and resistance is futile, as it pulls the
unlucky bacteria in and swallows it whole to digest it alive.</p>
<p>But despite the cruel efficiency and forceful effort, the wound is
too massive, the damage too great, the exposed surface too big. As the
Macrophages devour one enemy after another they realize that they can at
best slow this invasion down, not stop it. And so they begin to call for
help, sending out urgent alarm signals, and start preparing the
battlefield for reinforcements that will arrive shortly. Lucky for them,
backup is already under way. In the blood thousands of Neutrophils have
heard the cries for help and smelled the signs of death and begun to
move. At the site of infection they leave the rushing ocean of the blood
and enter the battlefield. Just like the Macrophages, the panic and
alarm signals activated them, turning them from pretty chill fellows
into killing frenzied maniacs.</p>
<p>Immediately they begin hunting and devouring bacteria whole, but with
much less care for their surroundings. Neutrophils are on a tight timer:
Once active they only have hours before they will die of exhaustion as
their weapons do not regenerate. So they make the best of the situation
and use them freely—not only killing enemies but also causing real
damage to the tissue they should be protecting in principle. But
collateral damage is not their concern at this moment or ever, as the
danger of bacteria spreading through the body is much too grave to
consider civilians. But they do not only fight, they also
self-sacrifice—some of them explode, casting wide and toxic nets around
themselves in the process. These nets are spiked with dangerous
chemicals that seal off the battlefield, trap and kill bacteria, and
make it harder for them to leave and hide.</p>
<p>Back in the world of the humans, you sit down again to take a second
look at the damage. The small wound is already covered by a very thin
film of crust. At this point the wound has already closed superficially
as millions of specialized cells from the blood flooded in the
battlefield: Platelets, blood cells that exist mainly to act as an
emergency worker that closes wounds. They produce a sort of large,
sticky net that clumps themselves and unlucky red blood cells together
and creates an emergency barrier to the outside world, stopping blood
loss rather quickly and preventing more intruders from entering. This
enables fresh skin cells to slowly start closing the enormous hole in
the world.*</p>
<p>Overall your toe has swollen a bit and feels warm and hurts slightly.
Annoying for sure, but no big deal you think as you curse your
carelessness and get ready to continue your walk, with a slight limp. Or
so you think. What you experience as a light swelling is a purposeful
reaction of your immune system. The cells fighting at the site of
infection started a crucial defense process: Inflammation.</p>
<p>This means they ordered your blood vessels to open up and let warm
fluid stream into the battlefield, like a dam opening up towards a
valley. This does a few things: For one, it stimulates and squeezes
nerve cells that are deeply unhappy about their situation and send pain
signals to the brain, which makes the human aware that something is
wrong and an injury occurred.</p>
<p>Still, that does not help with the hundreds of thousands of enemies
that already made their way in, but luckily the rush of fluid caused by
the inflammation carries a silent killer into the battle zone. Many
bacteria get stunned, or begin twitching as dozens of tiny wounds
mysteriously appear on their surfaces and make them ooze out their
insides, which is pretty bad and kills them. We’ll get to know this
silent killer intimately at a later point.</p>
<p>As the furious fighting rages on and as more and more bacteria are
killed, the first immune soldiers are dying too. They have given all
they got and now they just want to sleep. Millions of soldier cells
continue to stream in and bash in as many heads as they can before they
die themselves. We reach a crossroads. The battle can go multiple ways
now. In most cases, if things go well, this will more or less be the
extent of the damage. All bacteria are killed and the immune system
assists the civilian cells to heal. In the end this turns out to be a
tiny wound, the kind you sustain all the time and never think about.</p>
<p>But in this story things do not go well. Among the intruders there is
a pathogen. A soil bacteria that is actually able to deal with the
immune response and to multiply quickly. Bacteria are living things and
able to react to situations. And so they do, setting off defense
mechanisms that make them harder to kill or resistant against the
weapons of the immune system. The best the Innate Immune System can do
is to keep them in check.</p>
<p>So another immune cell now makes a serious decision. It has been
acting quietly in the background, monitoring the events at the
battlefield as they were unfolding. Now, hours after the catastrophe
happened and the infection began, its time to shine has finally
come.</p>
<p>The Dendritic Cell, the mighty messenger and intelligence officer of
the Innate Immune System did not just watch the disaster unfold.
Dendritic Cells are stationed everywhere the Border Kingdom can be
penetrated. Shaken up by the chaos and panic, they urgently began
collecting samples of the battlefield. Similarly to Macrophages,
Dendritic Cells have long tentacles to catch invaders and rip them into
pieces. But their goal was not to devour them—no, they prepared samples
made from the dead intruders, to present their findings to the
intelligence centers of the immune system. After a few hours of
sampling, the Dendritic Cells get on the move, leaving the battlefield
behind to get help from the Adaptive Immune System. It takes the
Dendritic Cell about a day to reach its destination and when it finds
what, or better, who it is looking for, a beast will rouse from its
sleep and all hell will break loose.</p>
<p>Let us pause here for a moment and consider how well your body was
prepared for this emergency. Cuts and bruises and stings by rusty and
pointy things are nothing we really worry about. It is just a fact of
life that you hurt from time to time and it almost never goes beyond
being slightly annoying. If the infection can’t be stopped a course of
antibiotics usually does the trick but for the vast, vast majority of
human history such powerful medication was not available and a small
injury could actually be deadly.</p>
<p>So your body had to evolve ways to brutally and quickly crush an
invasion that inevitably followed when your border kingdom got
compromised. And oh boy, is your Innate Immune System good at that. We
only very briefly met the cells who are your first line of defense, the
Macrophage, the Neutrophil, and the Dendritic Cell, but actually they
can do much more! And what about the mysterious invisible force that
killed and stunned the invaders but that we did neither name nor
describe.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>OK get ready for a wild story! Platelets are not actually cells but
cell fragments from another cell called megakaryocyte. Enormously large
fellows, that are around six times larger than your average cell and
live in your bone marrow. They have very long octopus-like arms, that
they push into your blood vessels and begin to grow them. When one of
these weird arms has grown enough, small packages break off. Functional
mini parts of cells that are carried away by the blood. These packages
are your platelets and every time you cut yourself or suffer a wound,
they close it. A single megakaryocyte produces around 10,000 of these
platelets in its lifetime from its flabby long arms that stretch from
your bones to into your blood. Your body is seriously so weird and so
amazing.</li>
</ul>
<p>8 The Soldiers of the Innate Immune System: Macrophages and
Neutrophils</p>
<p>As we were just able to witness, Macrophages and Neutrophils are the
damage dealers of the Immune system. Together they are a special class
of cells called phagocytes. Not the worst of all names in immunology
actually, as it means “Eating Cell.” And eat they do. Macrophage means
Great Eater, which is a great fit. Since cells don’t have tiny mouths,
eating on this level has to mean something else.</p>
<p>Imagine you had no mouth and wanted to eat like a phagocyte, it would
look something like this: You take a sandwich and hold it against your
skin. Where is not important, anyplace on your body will do. Your skin
folds in on itself and pulls the sandwich into your insides, trapping it
in a bag of skin that now floats to your stomach and merges with it,
dropping the sandwich in your stomach acid.</p>
<p>Disturbing in the human world, very practical in the cellular world.
The process is actually pretty fascinating. When a phagocyte, like a
Macrophage, wants to swallow an enemy, it reaches out to it and grabs it
tightly. Once it has a firm grip, it pulls its victim in, folds a part
of its membrane into itself, and engulfs the victim, trapping it in a
sort of mini prison that is now inside the Macrophage. In a sense, a
part of the outside of the Macrophage becomes a sort of tightly closed
garbage bag that is pulled inside. The Macrophage is equipped with an
abundance of compartments that are filled with the equivalent of stomach
acid—substances that dissolve things. These compartments then merge with
the tiny prison and pour their deadly contents all over the victim,
dissolving it into its components, into amino acids, sugars, and fats
that are not only harmless, but even useful. Some become food for the
Macrophage itself and others are spat out so other cells can have a meal
too. Life hates nothing as much as wasting resources.</p>
<p>This process is extremely important because it is the main way your
body gets rid of whole armies of invaders and their garbage. Indeed, one
of the main jobs of Macrophages is to eat and swallow stuff that the
body does not want around, battle or not.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the main things Macrophages eat are actually parts of
you. Most cells of your body are on a limited life timer to avoid
becoming faulty and turning into something bad, like cancer, for
example. So every second of your life, around one million of your cells
die by controlled cell suicide, called apoptosis (this process will come
up a few times in this book because it is very important). When cells
decide their time has come, they release a special signal letting
everybody else know that they are done. Then they destroy themselves via
apoptosis, which means that they split up into a bunch of small, neat
packages of cell garbage. Macrophages, attracted by the signals, pick up
the shreds of the former cells and recycle the parts.</p>
<p>Macrophages probably are an extremely old invention of the immune
system, maybe even the first sort of dedicated defense cell, since
almost all multicellular animals have some form of macrophage-like cell.
In a sense they are a bit like single-celled organisms. Their main job
is border patrol and garbage disposal unit, but they also help with
coordination of other cells, preparing the battlefield by causing
inflammation, and encouraging wound healing after an injury. As a bonus
they did not ask for, if you have a tattoo, a lot of it is probably
stored in your Macrophages.*1</p>
<p>Macrophages live up to several months. Billions of them hang out just
below your skin, patrolling the surfaces of things like your lungs and
the tissue that surrounds your intestines. Billions more hang out
throughout your body. In your liver and spleen, they catch old blood
cells and eat them whole to recycle the valuable iron they carry. In
your brain they make up around 15% of all cells and are extra calm, so
they don’t accidentally damage irreplaceable nerve cells that you need
for important things like thinking about movies or breathing air.</p>
<p>Macrophages don’t have very exciting lives. They hang around in the
area they are responsible for, wobble around, and pick up garbage and
dead cells. But if they become annoyed, they become terribly scary
fighters. An activated angry Macrophage can swallow up to 100 bacteria
before it dies of exhaustion. For a long time it was assumed that this
was what they were, a sort of aggressive janitor—but it turned out
Macrophages actually play many different roles and interact with a lot
of different cells for a variety of jobs.</p>
<p>So it might be better to look at Macrophages as a sort of local
captain of the Innate Immune System: In battle they tell other cells
what to do and inform them if fighting is still necessary.</p>
<p>Lastly, when an infection has been dealt with, Macrophages actually
can slow or even shut down the immune response at the site of battle to
prevent further damage. An ongoing immune reaction is not good for you
because immune cells generally put stress on the body and waste a lot of
energy and resources. So as a battle dies down, some Macrophages turn a
battlefield into a friendly construction site and literally begin to eat
the remaining soldiers. Then they release chemicals that help the
civilian cells regenerate and rebuild damaged structures like blood
vessels, so your wounds can heal faster. Again, the immune system hates
to waste anything.</p>
<p>The Neutrophil is a bit of a simpler fellow. It exists to fight and
to die for the collective. It is the crazy suicidal Spartan warrior of
the immune system. Or if you want to stay in the animal kingdom, a chimp
on coke with a bad temper and a machine gun. A sort of all-purpose
weapon system that is engineered to quickly deal with the most common
enemies your body encounters—especially bacteria. It is by far the most
abundant immune cell in your blood and easily one of the most potent.
Neutrophils are indeed so dangerous that they come with a kill switch.
They are on a tight timer and only live a few days when they are not
needed before they commit controlled suicide.</p>
<p>But even in battle their life is short and lasts only a few hours.
The risk of them wreaking havoc on the infrastructure of your body is
simply too high. And so every single day 100 billion Neutrophils give up
their lives voluntarily and die. And every single day around 100 billion
more are born, ready to fight for you if necessary.*2</p>
<p>But despite the danger they present to your body, they are
indispensable for your day-to-day survival and without them your defense
would be seriously maimed. When in combat, Neutrophils have two
additional weapon systems on top of eating enemies alive. They can throw
acid at enemies and kill themselves to create deadly traps. Neutrophils
are densely packed with granules, which are basically tiny packages
filled with a deadly load. You can imagine these granules as little
knives and scissors that are made to cut open and cripple intruders. So
if a Neutrophil encounters a bunch of bacteria in one place it will just
shower them with granules that rip their outsides apart. The problem
with this approach is that it is not super specific, and it hits whoever
is unlucky enough to be in the way. This often means your own healthy
civilian cells. And this is one of the reasons the body is sort of
afraid of Neutrophils. They kill very efficiently, but they can
potentially cause more harm than good if they get too excited.*3</p>
<p>But the most mind-boggling thing Neutrophils do in battle is to
create deadly nets of DNA, sacrificing themselves in the process. To get
an idea what this means, imagine you were a burglar and wanted to break
into a museum at night to steal and let your buddies in to have a
stealing-stuff party. So you are doing a great job and sneak by cameras
and security systems, entering the vaults where all the valuables are.
“Things are going great,” you think as you begin stuffing paintings into
your backpack.</p>
<p>But then, suddenly you see a guard charging at you screaming—you get
ready for a fight. But instead of swinging at you, the guard rips open
his chest, splitting his ribs into countless sharp splinters while
pulling out his intestines. You don’t even have time to get confused
before he starts swinging his guts, spiked with sharp bone splinters at
you, like the world’s most disgusting whip. You cry in pain and
confusion as he mercilessly strikes you, causing deep wounds and leaving
you stunned and unable to flee. And then he punches you in the face.
“This did not go as expected,” you think, as he begins eating you
alive.</p>
<p>This is what Neutrophils do when they create a Neutrophil
Extracellular Trap. Or NET for short. If Neutrophils get the impression
that drastic measures are called for, they begin this crazy kind of
suicide. First their nucleus begins to dissolve, freeing up their DNA.
As it fills up the cell, countless proteins and enzymes attach to it—the
sharp bone splinters from our little story. And then the Neutrophil
literally spits out its entire DNA around itself, like a giant net. Not
only can this net trap enemies in place and hurt them—it also creates a
physical barrier that makes it harder for bacteria or viruses to escape
and move deeper into the body. Usually the brave Neutrophil dies doing
this, which seems obvious.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even though they vomited out their DNA, these brave
warriors continue to fight, throwing acid at enemies or swallowing them
whole and doing Neutrophil stuff before they finally die of exhaustion.
The question could be asked if a cell that has given up its entire
genetic material is still alive. In any case, it can only go on for so
long—without DNA a cell has no way to maintain its inner machinery.
Whatever this cell is—a living entity or no more than a zombie following
its last commands mindlessly—it keeps doing what it was made to do: It
fights and dies for you, so you can live. No matter which of its weapon
systems it uses, the Neutrophil is one of your fiercest soldiers and one
that enemies, and our own bodies, are rightfully pretty afraid of.*4</p>
<p>Macrophages and Neutrophils have another important job that they
share with other parts of the immune system, and that we will discuss in
more detail in the next chapter because it is so utterly crucial for
your defenses: They cause inflammation, a process so important to your
defense and your health that we need to check out what is going on here.
So before we can come back to the battlefield and your army defending
you, we will do a short excursion and learn about a few fascinating and
very important mechanisms your immune system uses in a fight.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 Have you ever asked yourself why your body would be OK with having
huge amounts of ink below its skin? Because in general, your immune
system is not OK with anything that is not itself, or did not get a
special permit, hanging around in the body. But somehow, you can push
ink with a fast-moving needle into the second layer of your skin and it
remains there for many years. While the body is not excited about having
ink under its skin, if the person scratching tasteful art into your
flesh is doing their job correctly, it is also not particularly harmful.
Still, your local immune system is not pleased by the intrusion. And so
your skin swells and some of the ink particles are carried away. The
majority stays in the tissue though—not because Macrophages do not try
to gobble them up. Most of the metallic ink particles are just too large
to be swallowed, and so they remain where they are. The ones that are
small enough to be eaten, though, are eaten.</p>
<p>While Macrophages are really great at breaking down bacteria and
other cell garbage, they aren’t actually able to destroy the ink. So
they just keep it inside themselves and store it. If you have a tattoo,
when you look at it remember that it is partially trapped within your
immune system. Unfortunately if a few years later you decide that the
Chinese characters that turned out to mean “soup” are not as tasteful
anymore and want to get them removed, your immune system also makes it
really hard to get rid of a tattoo.</p>
<p>The most common process of tattoo removal is a special laser that
permeates your skin and heats up the ink particles so much on one side
that it is put under tension and breaks apart into smaller pieces. Some
float away, others are now eaten by Macrophages. This can make tattoo
removal very hard, because even though old ink-filled Macrophages die at
some point, young replacements arrive and swallow the remains of their
dead predecessors, complete with all the ink inside. Again they can’t
destroy it and so they just store and ignore it. This way tattoos stay
visible for years. Over time, with each new cycle of replacement some of
the ink gets lost and swept away in the process, or a few of the new
Macrophages move a tiny bit around. So your tattoo will fade out and
becomes less sharp on the edges.</p>
<p>*2 In actuality, you produce around one billion Neutrophils per two
pounds (a kilogram) of body weight; you can do the math for what this
means for you.</p>
<p>*3 Neutrophils are indeed so careless when it comes to causing
collateral damage that there are cases where Macrophages are trying to
hide damaged cells from them! Every day for a variety of reasons, a few
cells die in your organs in unnatural ways, maybe because you looked at
your phone and ran into a street sign for example. But often enough the
damage is pretty mild and does not require a strong reaction from your
immune system. We will learn more about it later, but dead cells attract
Neutrophils and if they find a single dead cell, they will escalate the
situation and cause even more damage that is not necessary. So to stop
them from that, Macrophages can sort of cover a single dead cell with
their body to literally hide it from Neutrophils, so they are confused
and leave again.</p>
<p>*4 Another neat little detail about Neutrophils is that when they are
chasing a pathogen, they often do so in swarms that follow the same
mathematical rules as swarms of insects. So imagine being hunted by a
bunch of hornets the size of cows and you get the same stressful
experience that many bacteria must go through in the last few moments of
their lives.</p>
<p>9 Inflammation: Playing with Fire</p>
<p>Inflammation is something you probably never have thought about that
much, since it’s pretty banal. You hurt yourself and the wound swells
and reddens a bit, big deal. Who cares. But actually, inflammation is
critically important for your survival and your health, enabling your
immune system to address sudden wounds and infections.</p>
<p>Inflammation is the universal response of your immune system to any
sort of breach or damage or insult. No matter if you burn yourself, cut
yourself, or get a bruise. No matter if bacteria or viruses infect your
nose, lungs, or gut. No matter if a young tumor kills a few civilian
cells by stealing their nutrients or you have an allergic reaction to a
food, inflammation is the response. Damage or danger—perceived or
real—causes inflammation.</p>
<p>Inflammation is the red swelling and itching from an insect bite, the
sore throat when you have a cold.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, its purpose is to restrict an infection to an area and
stop it from spreading, but also to help remove damaged and dead tissue
and to serve as a sort of expressway for your immune cells and attack
proteins directly to the site of infection!*1</p>
<p>Paradoxically, inflammation is also one of the most unhealthy things
that can happen to you if it becomes chronic. According to pretty new
science, chronic inflammation is involved in more than half of all
deaths each year as it is an underlying cause of a wide variety of
diseases—from various cancers to strokes or liver failure. And yes, you
read that correctly—for at least one in two people who died today,
chronic inflammation was the underlying cause of the disease that killed
them. Despite the fact that chronic inflammation is so taxing to the
body, “regular” inflammation is indispensable for your defense.</p>
<p>Inflammation is a team effort, a complex biological response of your
immune system to mount a rapid defense against injury or infections. In
a nutshell, inflammation is a process that makes the cells in blood
vessels change their shape, so that plasma, the liquid part from your
blood, can flood into a wounded or infected tissue. You can literally
imagine this as floodgates opening and a tsunami of water, filled with
salts and all sorts of special attack proteins, flooding the spaces
between your cells so rapidly that tissue on the scale of a metropolitan
area balloons up. Wherever your cells suspect that something fishy is
going on they order inflammation as a dramatic first response.*2</p>
<p>You can tell if you have inflammation through five markers: Redness,
heat, swelling, pain, and loss of function. So for example, in our story
where you stepped on a sharp nail, the injured toe was flooded with
fluid and swelled up, so it became red because of extra blood in the
tissue.</p>
<p>The injured toe becomes hot as the blood brings extra body heat. This
heat does useful things for you: Most microorganisms do not like it
hot—so making the wound hotter slows them down and makes their lives
stressful. And you want pathogens in your body to be as stressed as
possible. In contrast, your civilian repair cells like the extra
temperature very much as it speeds up their metabolism and enables your
wound to heal faster.</p>
<p>Then there is pain. Some of the chemicals released by inflammation
make your nerve endings more susceptible to pain and through the process
of swelling, there is pressure on nerve cells with pain receptors,
motivating them to send whiny signals to the brain. Pain is a very
effective motivation in the sense that we prefer not feeling it.</p>
<p>And lastly there is loss of function. This one is pretty
straightforward—if you burn your hand and inflammation makes it swell up
and hurt, you can’t use it properly. Same with stepping on a nail—your
foot is just not happy about this event. Together with the pain, this
loss of function makes sure that you rest and don’t burden or strain
your wounded body part. It forces you to give yourself time to heal.
These are the five hallmarks of inflammation.</p>
<p>As we will encounter over and over again in this book, inflammation
is very hard on the body as it causes stress in the affected tissue and
brings in agitated immune cells like Neutrophils that do damage, so it
has a few built-in mechanisms that damp it down again. For example, the
chemical signals that cause inflammation are used up pretty quickly. So
inflammation needs to be requested consistently by your immune cells or
it just dissipates by itself. You might ask, but what exactly is causing
inflammation? Well, a variety of mechanisms.</p>
<p>The first way inflammation gets started is through dying cells.
Amazingly, your body evolved a way to recognize if a cell died a natural
way or if it died a violent death. The immune system has to assume that
cells dying an unnatural death means grave danger, and so death is a
signal that causes inflammation.</p>
<p>Normally, when a cell has reached the end of its life, it kills
itself through apoptosis that we encountered already. Apoptosis is
basically a calm suicide that keeps the contents of the cells nice and
tidy. But when cells die in unnatural ways, for example by being ripped
into pieces by a sharp nail, burned to death by a hot pan, or poisoned
by the waste products of a bacterial infection, the insides of your
civilian cells spill all over the place. Certain parts of the guts of
your cells, like DNA or RNA, are high-alert triggers for your immune
system and cause rapid inflammation.*3</p>
<p>This is also a good moment to introduce a very special cell that you
might learn to hate later on when we learn more about it—if you ever had
a severe allergic reaction where your body did swell up explosively,
this cell had most likely a hand in it: The Mast Cell. Mast Cells are
large, bloated cells filled with tiny bombs containing extremely potent
chemicals that cause rapid and massive local inflammation. (For example,
the itching you feel when a mosquito bites you was probably caused by
chemicals the Mast Cell released.) They mostly sit below your skin and
do their thing, which is thankfully not much. If you hurt yourself and
tissue is destroyed and they die or they get really agitated, Mast Cells
release their inflammation supercharger chemicals and speed up the
process immensely.</p>
<p>This way the tissue below your skin has an inflammation emergency
button. This might be a good place to note that some immunologists
believe that the Mast Cell plays a much more direct and central role in
the immune system, although that is not part of most textbooks. The
great thing about science is that proving established ideas wrong is a
win for everybody, so we’ll know in a few years if Mast Cells deserve
more love.</p>
<p>The next best way to cause inflammation is more of an active
decision: Macrophages and Neutrophils order inflammation when they are
engaged in a battle. This way, as long as fighting is going on, they
release chemicals that keep the battlefield flooded and ready to take in
fresh reinforcements. But this is also one of the reasons why having any
kind of battle going on for a long time is bad.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a lung infection like pneumonia or COVID-19,
inflammation and the fluid that it summons into the lung tissue can make
it hard to breathe and create feelings of drowning. The feeling is
horrifyingly accurate in this case, as you are literally drowning in
extra fluid, only fluid that came from the inside rather than the
outside.</p>
<p>OK, enough about inflammation for now—just to summarize: If your
cells are dying unnaturally, if you rupture or annoy a Mast Cell below
the skin, or if your immune system is fighting enemies, they release
chemicals that cause inflammation. A flood of fluids and all sorts of
chemicals, which annoy your enemies, attract reinforcements, and make it
easier for them to get into the infected tissue, all of which make it
easier to defend a battlefield. But inflammation is hard on the body and
in many cases presents a real danger to the health of the body.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 The way inflammation helps immune cells to get to the battlefield
is very weird and fascinating. What basically happens is that the
chemical signals from inflammation trigger a change in your blood
vessels close to where the inflammation signals are coming from, and in
your immune cells that get activated by these signals. Both parties
extend many little special adhesion molecules that work a bit like
Velcro. The immune cells that are speeding through the blood now can
stick to the cells making up the blood vessels, and slow down close to
the site of infection. On top of that, inflammation makes your blood
vessels more porous, which makes it easier for your immune cells to
squeeze through tiny spaces and move towards the battlefield.</p>
<p>*2 Everything related to the immune system has an exception. There
are a few areas in your body that are excluded from this rule, like your
brain, spinal cord, part of your eyes, and testicles (if you happen to
have testicles, that is). All are extremely sensitive regions where
inflammation could cause immediate, irreparable damage and so these
areas are so-called immune privileged, which means that cells of the
immune system are kept out of there by the blood-tissue barriers—and
those that are allowed in are on super special orders to behave.</p>
<p>*3 You probably learned in school that mitochondria, the powerhouse
of the cell, were ancient bacteria that merged with the ancestors of
your cells to become a symbiotic organism. Today they are organelles
inside your cells that provide the cell with useful energy. Your immune
system still remembers them as bacteria though, as intruders that have
no business being outside cells. So if your cells burst and your immune
system detects mitochondria floating around, your immune cells will
react super alarmed.</p>
<p>10 Naked, Blind, and Afraid: How Do Cells Know Where to Go?</p>
<p>At this point we have totally been ignoring another pretty important
detail: How do cells know which way is which and where to go and where
they are needed? When we imagine cells as people and remember that
they’re patrolling the equivalent area of the European continent, one of
the first questions you might have is, how could they possibly go the
right way? Wouldn’t they get lost constantly? Also, to make this a bit
more challenging, cells are blind, which makes sense if you think about
it for a moment.</p>
<p>The process of seeing something requires light waves to hit the
surface of an object, bounce back from that surface, and hit a sensory
organ like your eye, where a few hundred million specialized cells
transform them into electrical signals that are sent off to your brain
for interpretation. All of this seems to be a bit too much of an
investment for single cells.*1</p>
<p>Even if cells did have eyes, on their scale, “seeing” would not be
very useful. Because their world is really, really small, and for a
single cell, light waves are huge and impractical. If you were the size
of a cell, the waves of visible light would reach from your toes to your
belly button! Bacteria are already so small that they are barely visible
with light microscopes and images of them are pretty grainy. And viruses
are even smaller, considerably smaller than light waves and therefore
invisible in any sense that we consider seeing, except with specialized
tools like electron microscopes. Besides, most places inside your body
are pretty dark. If your insides are well lit, something has gone
horribly wrong.</p>
<p>The same principle is true for hearing, which is the ability to
detect changes in the pressure of gases and fluids and transform these
differences into information. Another thing we have dedicated organs for
and that fits the environment humans live in and is impractical for
cells. OK, “seeing” and “hearing” in the sense humans are used to is not
a great option in the microworld. So how do cells experience their
world? How do they sense it and how do they communicate with each
other?</p>
<p>Well, in a way, cells smell their way through life. For cells,
information is a physical thing: Cytokines. In a nutshell, cytokines are
very small proteins that are used to convey information. There are
hundreds of different cytokines and they are important in almost every
biological process going on inside of you—from your development in your
mother’s womb to the degeneration you experience as you get older. But
the field where they are the most relevant and important is your immune
system. They play a crucial role in the development of diseases and how
your cells are able to respond. In a sense cytokines are the language of
your immune cells. We will encounter them a few times in this book, so
let us get an idea of what they do:</p>
<p>Let’s say a Macrophage floats around and stumbles over an enemy. The
discovery needs to be shared with other immune cell buddies, so it
releases cytokines that carry the information “Danger! Enemy around!
Come help out!” These cytokines then float away, carried purely by the
random motion of particles in your bodily fluids. Somewhere else,
another immune cell, maybe a Neutrophil, smells these cytokines up and
“receives” the information. The more cytokines it picks up, the stronger
it reacts to them.</p>
<p>So when the rusty nail penetrated our skin and caused untold death
and destruction, thousands of cells screamed in unison and released a
very high amount of panic cytokines, which translates into the
information that something horrible had happened and they needed urgent
help, alerting thousands of cells to move. But this is not all, the
smell of cytokines also functions as a navigation system.*2</p>
<p>The closer to the origin of the source of a smell a cell is, the more
cytokines it will pick up. By measuring the concentration of cytokines
in the space around it, it can precisely locate where the message is
coming from and then begin moving in that direction. It is sort of
“smelling” where the smell is the most intense. Which will lead it to
the site of battle.</p>
<p>To do this, your immune cells don’t have a single nose, they have
millions of them, all over their bodies, covering their membranes in
every direction.</p>
<p>Why so many? For two reasons: First, by being covered by noses, cells
have a 360° smell system. They can pretty precisely tell from which
direction a cytokine is coming from. These noses are so sensitive that
for some cells, as little a concentration difference as 1% in the
cytokine signals around a cell is enough to tell it where to go. (Which
is a fancy way of saying that there might just be 1% more molecules on
one side of the cell.) This information is used to orient the cell in
space and then make it move towards its target, always following the
path where the most cytokines are coming from. A cell takes a step and
then a whiff. And then it takes another step and takes another whiff.
Until it gets to where it is needed.</p>
<p>The other reason it is good to have millions of noses is to prevent
cells from making a mistake. Because your immune cells are blind and
deaf and stupid, they have no way of asking questions. They don’t know
if a signal is real or if they are interpreting it correctly. For
example, a Neutrophil could pick up a cytokine that would be left over
from an already-won battle. Being wrong would be a waste of resources or
could distract the Neutrophil. The solution is not to rely on one single
nose but on many at the same time. Smelling something with one single
nose will yield no reaction. A few dozen noses smelling something will
get an immune cell mildly excited. But a few hundred or even thousands
will rile it up pretty intensely and make it react with striking
violence!</p>
<p>This principle is extremely important. A signal needs to pass a
specific threshold to compel a cell to do something. This is one of the
ingenious regulatory mechanisms of your immune system. A small infection
with a couple dozen bacteria will only cause a few immune cells to send
out a few cytokines and only a few other cells will smell these signals.
But if the infection is big and more dangerous, many signals will be
sent, and many cells will react. And because there is a lot of battle
“perfume” around them, they will react decisively. Not only does the
intensity of the smell call more cells to help, it also makes sure that
an immune response shuts itself down. The more successful the soldiers
at the battlefield are and the fewer enemies are alive, the fewer
cytokines the immune cells will release. Over time, fewer and fewer
reinforcements will be summoned to the battlefield. And on the
battlefield the fighting cells will die over time through suicide. If
things go correctly, the immune system shuts itself off.</p>
<p>In some cases this whole system can break down though and have
horrible consequences. If there are too many cytokines the immune system
can lose all constraint, become super enraged, and overreact
massively—which leads to an appropriately named cytokine storm. This is
nothing more than way too many immune cells releasing way too many
cytokines even if there is no danger. But the consequences are horrible.
The flood of activating signals wakes up immune cells all over the body,
who then might release more. Inflammation rises massively and is no
longer limited just to the place of infection. Immune cells flood the
affected organs and can cause profound damage. Blood vessels all over
the body get leaky and fluid rushes into the tissue and out of the
vascular system. In the worst case, the blood pressure will fall to
critical levels, and organs will not receive enough oxygen and begin to
shut down, which can end deadly. Luckily in your day-to-day you don’t
need to worry about this too much though; cytokine storms only happen
when things go horribly wrong.</p>
<p>We sort of have elegantly skipped over a question, though: How
exactly do cytokines convey information and what does this mean? How
does a protein tell a cell what to do? As we discussed before, cells are
protein robots guided by biochemistry. The chemistry of life causes
sequences of interactions between proteins that are called pathways. The
activation of pathways causes behavior. In the case of cytokines, the
information protein of the immune system, this happens through pathways
that involve special structures called receptors on cell surfaces. They
are the noses of your cells.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, receptors are protein recognition machines that stick
in the membranes of cells. A part of them is outside the cell and
another part is inside the cell. Actually, about half of the surface of
your cells is covered by myriads of different receptors for all sorts of
functions, from taking in certain nutrients to communicating with other
cells or as triggers for a variety of behaviors. In a simplified way,
receptors are sort of the sensory organs of cells that let the insides
of the cells know what happens on the outside. So if a receptor
recognizes a cytokine, it triggers a pathway inside the cell. A sequence
of proteins interacting with each other that end up signaling the genes
of the cell to be either more or less active.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, proteins interact with proteins a few times, until
eventually, they change the behavior of a cell. The actual biochemistry
of the immune system is a nightmare all on its own so we will skip the
details here. (Even though it can be pretty cool to learn if you are
patient and have a high tolerance for lots of complicated names.)</p>
<p>So to summarize the important parts: Cells have millions of noses on
their outsides that are called receptors. They communicate by releasing
proteins that carry information, called cytokines. When a cell smells
cytokines with their receptors (noses), they trigger pathways inside the
cell that change their gene expression and therefore the behavior of the
cell. So cells can react to information without being conscious or
having the ability to think, guided by the biochemistry of life. This
enables them to do pretty smart things even though they are technically
very stupid. Some cytokines do also function as a navigation system—an
immune cell can smell where they are coming from and literally follow
their noses to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Now that we learned how cells sense their environment, there is one
last principle that is important for understanding your immune system
before we return to the battlefield. How does a cell “know” what a
bacterium smells like? Why do bacteria smell like bacteria at all? How
does your immune system recognize friend from foe?</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 Yes, there are single-celled organisms that have photoreceptors,
enabling them to note the difference between dark and not dark and the
direction where light is coming from. But this is not what we are
talking about here.</p>
<p>*2 OK, technically we could be more precise here. There are two
general classes of cytokines relevant at this point: The cytokines that
convey information and chemokines. Chemokines are a family of small
cytokines secreted by cells. Their name means “move chemical” and is
very fitting as their main ability is to motivate cells to move in a
certain direction. They are not just floating around, certain civilian
cells also can pick them up and sort of “decorate” themselves with them,
to function as a sort of guide system for immune cells. So in a
nutshell, chemokines are cytokines that are guiding or attracting immune
cells to a place. When immunologists talk about “cytokines,” they
usually mean cytokines that confer information like what is going on in
an infection, which type of pathogen has invaded, and which cell is
needed to fight it. OK wait, this is getting confusing. Chemokines are
cytokines but also cytokines do different things than chemokines? Well,
welcome to the world of immunology, where words exist to make your life
harder. Here is how we are going to solve this in this book: We will
just use the word cytokines because to understand the general principles
you need to understand one thing: Cytokines are a diverse group of
information proteins that make your immune cells do a lot of different
things. One of them is to make them move.</p>
