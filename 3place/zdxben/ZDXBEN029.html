Immune—How Your Immune System Remembers an Enemy Forever</h4>
<p>Think of the influenza A infection that killed millions of your cells
in one of your most important organs and forced you to bed for two
weeks. Beating such an invasion comes at a massive cost to your whole
body even in our modern world, and indeed up to half a million people
are killed each year by the flu. One can only imagine how dangerous an
infection like this would have been to our ancestors living without the
protective veil of civilization where things like safe shelter and food
are no concern. Your body really does not want to do this again, being
sick leaves you vulnerable, and in the worst case it kills you.</p>
<p>Remembering the enemies it fought in the past and keeping that memory
alive is one of the most important abilities of your immune system. Only
through memory do you become immune, which roughly translated from Latin
means “exempt.” So if you are immune, you are exempt from a disease. You
can’t be struck down by the same illness twice (of course there are
exceptions, there are always exceptions…).</p>
<p>The fact that our bodies are becoming immune to diseases after
contracting and surviving them is not a new idea though. Twenty-five
hundred years ago when Thucydides, the first modern historian in human
history, wrote down his account of the Peloponnesian War between Athens
and Sparta, he observed during an outbreak of the plague, that people
who survived the disease seemed to be immune to it afterwards.</p>
<p>Without immunological memory, you would never become immune to
anything, which would be like a horrible nightmare if you think about
it. Every time you beat a serious infection your body is weakened. It
costs a lot of energy to make all these immune cells and repair the
damage they cause, and the devastation from the pathogen itself needs to
be cleared up too. Say you survive Ebola, smallpox, or the Black Death
or COVID-19 or hell, just the flu, only to get it again, a few weeks
later. How often in a row could you survive that, even if you are a
healthy adult? Without immunity modern civilization with its cities and
large agglomerations of people would be impossible. The danger of
getting constantly reinfected with the worst pathogens in existence
would just be too high.</p>
<p>So you have an immune memory, and it is a living thing! Or many
living things, as we introduced briefly before: Memory Cells.
Approximately 100 billion living beings, 100 billion parts of YOU,
sitting all over your body, doing nothing but remembering what you went
through. Isn’t this a tiny bit poetic, the fact that being immune means
that there is a part of you remembering your struggles and making you
stronger by its presence?</p>
<p>Memory cells are one of the main reasons why young children often die
of diseases that their parents shake off easily: There are just not
enough living memories in their tiny bodies yet, and so even smaller
infections can spread and become a mortal danger. Their parents, with an
Adaptive Immune System that is remembering thousands of invasions, can
just rely on their living memory. And likewise, as we reach old age,
more and more Memory Cells stop working as well as when they were
younger or just call it quits, leaving us exposed in the last phase of
our lives.</p>
<p>To briefly refresh your memory: B Cells need two activation signals
to truly activate. The first one is delivered by antigen floating
through the lymph nodes, and it leads to moderately activated B Cells.
But if an activated Helper T Cell joins the party, it can deliver signal
number two and confirm that the infection is serious, which activates
the B Cell in earnest. Now the B Cell turns into a Plasma Cell that
rapidly makes a lot more of itself and begins producing antibodies. So
far so good, let’s add another layer of detail!</p>
<p>After B Cells are activated through T Cells, some of them will turn
into different kinds of Memory Cells! Living memory that will protect
you for months, years, maybe even your whole life.</p>
<p>The first group is called Long-Lived Plasma Cells who wander into
your bone marrow and as their very creative name suggests, they live
pretty long. Instead of vomiting out as many Antibodies as they can,
they make themselves comfortable and find a home where they will stay
for months and years. From there they constantly produce a moderate
amount of Antibodies. So their entire job is to make sure that specific
Antibodies against enemies we fought off in the past are always present
in your bodily fluids.</p>
<p>If the enemy shows up ever again, it will immediately get attacked by
these antibodies and probably has no chance to become a real danger
again. This is an extremely efficient tactic and in fact a single drop
of your blood contains about 13,000,000,000,000 Antibodies. Thirteen
million, million. A protein memory of all the challenges you overcame in
your life.</p>
<p>But this is not all, there are also Memory B Cells. They do: Nothing.
Nothing at all. Memory B Cells also settle down in your lymph nodes
after they are activated, and just chill.</p>
<p>For years and years they are inactive and just silently scan the
lymph for the antigen they remember. If they ever catch an antigen they
awake suddenly and react without any sense of humor. They very rapidly
proliferate and make thousands of clones of themselves that don’t need
Helper T Cells to properly activate but start as Plasma Cells that
immediately begin to produce millions of Antibodies en masse.</p>
<p>This is the reason why you are immune forever against so many
diseases and pathogens you encountered in your life—your Memory B Cells
basically can activate directly, without going through all the
complicated dances and confirmations that we showed throughout the book
so far. They are shortcuts that can activate your Adaptive Immune System
in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>What makes Memory B Cells so powerful from the start is that the
fine-tuning that happens to their receptors, as we described in the
chapter “The Dance of the T and the B,” has already happened to them.
They already went through the process and have become extremely good at
making the perfect Antibodies for the pathogen. So if the intruder now
attacks again, it will be confronted with Antibodies that are the most
deadly to them.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, activated T Cells also produce Memory Cells,
although with a few key differences. For one, after an infection is
over, about 90% of all T Cells who fought at the site of the infection
will kill themselves. The remaining 10% will turn into Tissue-Resident
Memory T Cells, and become silent guardians. These Memory T Cells are
dormant sleeper agents, that lie and wait without doing anything. If
they ever spot the intruder again they will awaken and attack and
activate the surrounding immune cells immediately though.</p>
<p>But this is not enough because this would only protect the infected
area and not the rest of the body, so there are Effector Memory T Cells.
For years they patrol the lymphatic system and your blood, not causing
trouble, just looking for the antigen that once activated the cell that
was their ancestor. And lastly, there are Central Memory T Cells, which
remain stationary in your lymph nodes, doing nothing but keeping the
memory of the attack. When activated they quickly produce massive
amounts of new Effector T Cells that go on the attack right away.</p>
<p>Now, all of this is simple enough (relatively speaking). But it can’t
be overstated how incredibly effective memory cells are. They are so
powerful and deadly that you usually will not even notice if you are
reinfected by the same pathogen—even if it is a serious and dangerous
one. Once your body has memory cells against an invader you are
basically immune for decades, if not your whole life.</p>
<p>What makes your immune living memory so deadly? Well for one, they
exist in much larger numbers. As we discussed before, your body makes
only a few B and T Cells for every possible invader. Think back to our
example of the dinner party with millions of possible guests. Our immune
system cooks tried to be ready and prepared countless dishes, with every
combination of ingredients. Each dish represents a unique T or B Cell
with a unique receptor for one specific antigen. So when an infection
first occurs, you might have only a dozen cells that are able to
recognize the antigens of the enemy that invades your body.</p>
<p>And this makes sense because most of the many billions of B and T
Cells your body makes during your lifetime will never see action. Your
immune system is just trying to be prepared for every eventuality, no
matter how unlikely it is. But once a pathogen with a specific antigen
shows up, your Immune System knows that the antigen exists. So at this
point the investment of having many more of the specific cells in store
that can fight the pathogen is justified.</p>
<p>In our dinner party example, this is like getting confirmation about
what ingredients and dishes your guests really liked! So for the future,
the immune system cook can keep certain dishes in the freezer so he can
serve the guests quickly if they show up again.</p>
<p>Just by pure numbers, the chances that if the same pathogen invades
you again, one of your memory cells will be activated very early and
catch the enemy very quickly are pretty high. All of these properties
together make you immune against the vast majority of dangers you had to
face in your past and increase the chance of your survival
significantly. There are diseases though that are able to destroy your
immunological memory. To kill the memory cells that defend you. It is
tragic that one of these diseases is currently making a huge comeback:
Measles.</p>
<p>An Aside What Doesn’t Kill You Doesn’t Make You Stronger: Measles and
Memory Cells</p>
<p>Measles is one of these controversial diseases whose fate is tightly
bound to the movement against vaccinations. While measles was on its way
to becoming the second human pathogen to be completely eradicated since
smallpox, it has made somewhat of a comeback in the last few years as
more and more people decided to not vaccinate their kids against the
virus.</p>
<p>Ironically these movements are primarily based in the developed world
where people have forgotten how much of a serious disease measles still
is. Globally, measles killed more than 200,000 people in 2019, most of
them children, a 50% increase since 2016. Despite this sad and
unnecessary rise in deaths, if you get measles in a developed country
with access to good healthcare, chances are still very good that you
will recover.</p>
<p>But there is a vicious part of measles that is not discussed as much
as the disease itself: Kids who overcome a measles infection have a
higher chance of getting other diseases afterwards because the measles
virus kills Memory Cells. If you think that sounds a bit scary, that is
the correct reaction—the virus basically deletes your acquired immunity.
Let us explore how this works now that we know all the different
elements of your immune system.</p>
<p>The measles virus is extraordinarily infectious—considerably more
infectious than the novel coronavirus for example. Similar to many other
viruses, measles spreads through coughs and sneezes and floats through
the air in tiny droplets that stay airborne for up to two hours. If you
have measles, you’re so contagious that 90% of all susceptible people
that come close to you will be infected just by being in your vicinity.
So if you have it and other, non-vaccinated people share a subway train
or a classroom with you, it is highly likely that you will infect
others.</p>
<p>The favorite victims of measles are your T and B Cells but especially
your Long-Lived Plasma and Memory B and T Cells that are vulnerable to
the virus. Measles is targeting the actual, living, breathing memory
part of your immune system and at the peak, millions, if not billions of
your immune cells may be infected.</p>
<p>Luckily your immune system usually regains control of the situation
and eradicates the measles virus. But the memory cells that were
infected by the virus are dead and can’t be brought back. Before the
infection your body was full of specific Antibodies, and many of them
are no longer being produced. On top of that a lot of the wandering
Effector Memory Cells have died off. It is as if your immune system
suffers from sudden and harsh amnesia.</p>
<p>So in the end, being infected with measles erases the capacity of the
immune system to protect you from the diseases that you overcame in the
past. Even worse, a measles infection can wipe away the protection that
you might have gained from other vaccines, since most vaccines create
memory cells. Therefore, in the case of measles, what does not kill you
makes you weaker, not stronger. Measles causes irreversible, long-term
harm and it maims and kills children.</p>
<p>If we lose our grip in the war on measles we will see the number of
people, and especially children, dying of preventable diseases increase
each year. In any case—this might be a good moment to talk a bit about a
huge idea in our history. The idea to cause immunity without suffering a
disease.</p>
