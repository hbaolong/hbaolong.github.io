<h4 id="the-desert-kingdom-of-the-skin">6 The Desert Kingdom of the
Skin</h4>
<p>Your skin is the envelope of your insides, covering almost all the
parts that you perceive as your outsides. It has the most direct contact
with the world of any part of your body. This makes it crucial for the
skin to be a really good border wall to protect you against all sorts of
microbes trying to get in. Not only that, just through the process of
living, it constantly gets damaged and hurt, so it needs to regenerate
constantly. Luckily, the Desert Kingdom of the Skin is really good at
all of that! There are a number of ingenious strategies the kingdom uses
to be almost impossible to overcome for an intruder. The first one is
that it is constantly dying. You can imagine your skin less as a wall
and more like a conveyor belt of death. To understand how, we need to
dive to the bottom, where your skin is created and produced.</p>
<p>The life of your skin cells begins around one millimeter deep. Here,
the Skin Industrial Complex is situated. In the basal layer, stem cells
do nothing but calmly multiply. They are cloning themselves, all day and
night, producing new cells that begin a journey from the inside to the
outside. The cells born here are special because they have a hard job.
To be literally tough, not just figuratively, your skin cells produce a
lot of keratin—a very tough protein that makes up the hard part of your
skin, nails, and hairs. So your skin cells are hardy fellows, filled
with special material that makes them hard to break.</p>
<p>As soon as they are born, they need to leave home. The skin stem
cells constantly make new skin cells, and each new generation pushes the
older ones further up. So your skin cells are constantly pushed upward
by younger skin cells emerging below them. The closer they get to the
surface, the more they need to become ready to be living defenders. And
so as your skin cells mature, they develop long spikes and interlock
with the other cells around them to form a dense and impassable wall.
Next your skin cells begin manufacturing lamellar bodies, tiny bags that
squirt out fat to create a waterproof and impermeable coat that covers
the cells and the little bit of space that is left between them.</p>
<p>This coat does three things: It acts as another physical border that
is extremely hard to pass; it makes it easier to dispose of dead skin
cells later on; and it is filled with natural antibiotics called
defensins, which can straight up murder enemies on their own. Your skin
goes from newborn baby cell to expertly trained defender in the epic
journey of a single millimeter.*1</p>
<p>As the skin cells are pushed up further towards the surface they
begin preparing for their final job: Dying. They become flatter and
bigger and begin to stick together even tighter until they merge
together into inseparable clumps. And then they shed their water and
kill themselves.</p>
<p>Cells killing themselves is nothing special in your body, every
second at least one million of your body cells go through some form of
controlled suicide. And usually, when cells kill themselves, they do so
in a way that’s easy to clean up their corpses. But in the case of your
skin cells, their dead bodies are actually very useful. You could even
say that the purpose of their life is to die in the right place and
become neat carcasses. The wall of merged, dead skin corpses is
consistently pushed upward. Up to fifty layers of dead cells, fused
together on top of each other, form the dead part of your skin that
ideally covers your whole body.</p>
<p>When you look at yourself in the mirror, what you are really seeing
is a very thin film of death covering your alive parts. As this dead
layer of your skin is damaged and used up by the process of you living
your life, it is constantly shed and replaced by new cells moving up
from the stem cells deep below. Depending on your age, it takes your
skin between thirty and fifty days to completely turn over. Every single
second, you shed around 40,000 dead skin cells. So your outer border
wall is constantly producing, emerging, and then discarding. Think about
how ingenious and amazing a defense this is. Not only are the walls of
the Skin Border Kingdom consistently replaced and fixed, as they move up
they get coated in a fatty layer of passive and natural antibiotics. And
even if enemies find a place to make their home and start eating away at
the dead skin cells, they are consistently shed away from the body,
making it much harder to gain a foothold on the skin.*2</p>
<p>When it is warm, humans sweat a lot, which both cools us and also
transports a lot of salt to the surface. Most of it is reabsorbed but
some of it remains, overall making your skin a pretty salty place, which
many microbes don’t like. As if that’s not enough, sweat contains even
more natural antibiotics that can passively kill microbes.</p>
<p>So your skin does everything it can to be a real hellhole. From the
perspective of a bacteria, it is a dry and salty desert filled with
geysers that spit out toxic fluid and flush enemies away.</p>
<p>But this is still not all. Another one of the great passive defenses
of your skin is that it is covered in a very fine film of acid,
appropriately called the acid mantle, which is a mixture of sweat and
other substances secreted by glands below your skin. The acid mantle is
not so harsh that it would hurt you, it just means that the pH of your
skin is slightly low and therefore slightly acidic and that is something
a lot of microorganisms don’t like. Imagine that your bed were sprinkled
with battery acid. You would likely survive the night but you would
suffer chemical burns and you would not be happy about your situation,
and that’s exactly how the bacteria feel.<em>3, </em>4</p>
<p>The acid mantle has another great passive effect mostly geared
towards bacteria: The inside and outside of your body have different pH
levels. So if a bacterium adapts to the acidic environment on the skin
and then gets an opportunity to enter the bloodstream, for example,
through an open wound, it has a problem: Your blood has a higher pH. So
the bacterium suddenly finds itself in an environment that it is not
adapted to, with very little time to do so, which is a considerable
challenge to some species.</p>
<p>OK. So the skin is like a desert covered in acid, salt, and defensins
and the ground is a graveyard of dead cells that are constantly shed
away along with everybody unfortunate enough to sit on it. Learning
about all of this, one might think that it is impossible for microbes to
live on your skin. But this is far from the truth. In the endless
universe of the microworld there is nothing like an uninhabited space.
Everything is free real estate, no matter how hostile it is. But your
body found a way to take advantage of this fact and make its defenses
even tighter. Aside from your gut, which is basically made for and ruled
by bacteria your body has invited in, your skin is the second most
populated place of your body in terms of guests that are not you, but
are indeed welcome. A healthy individual’s skin holds up to forty
different bacteria species, as different areas of your skin are
drastically different environments with their own specific climates and
temperatures. Your armpits, hands, face, and buttocks are pretty
different places and house different guests. Overall, an average square
centimeter of your skin is home to around a million bacteria. About ten
billion friendly bacteria in total populate your outsides right now. And
while you might not like this thought, you need them!</p>
<p>You can imagine these bacteria as a sort of barbarian horde in front
of the gates. Your body has built a huge border wall and invited
barbaric tribes to settle in front of it. They get to live off the land
and enjoy free resources and space if they respect the border. As long
as the balance is upheld, the Border Kingdom and the tribes live not
only in harmony, but even in symbiosis. Should the barbarians try to
enter though, maybe because the border is breached by an injury, the
soldiers of the immune system will attack and kill them without mercy.
So what do these billions of barbarian bacteria cells do for you? The
most important thing is just taking up space. Squatting in a house is
much harder if there are people already living there.</p>
<p>Your skin microbiome is pretty happy with its environment and does
not intend to share it with strangers. So not only do they consume the
available resources and physically occupy space, they communicate,
regulate, and interact directly with the Border Kingdom and the immune
cells living on the other side. For example, some of your bacterial
guardians can produce substances that harm unwelcome guests. Going even
further, it seems that they are even able to regulate the immune cells
below the skin and tell it which harmful substances they should produce
and in what quantities.</p>
<p>Once you reach adulthood, the composition of the microbes on your
skin will remain relatively stable for the rest of your life, which
means that there really is a shared benefit for your barbarian tribes
and your body to find a balance and live in peace. It’s an arrangement
that everybody wants to uphold. Scientists don’t completely understand
yet how this deal is made, how the immune system decides who is allowed
to settle, or how the bacteria educate the immune system about their
intentions. But we know that this relationship exists and that it is
very important.</p>
<p>Despite all those amazing defenses, the kingdom can be breached. Skin
cells may be tough, but the world is tougher. And there are always
bacteria ready to take a chance if they get one. Let us witness the
immune system in real action for the first time.</p>
<p>Before we dive into a story, a short note: The way we will describe
an infection and the response of the immune system is an idealized
example. One where things happen in a clear sequence, one level of
escalation after another, each level clearly triggered by the one that
came before. So just keep in mind—reality is more complex. We are
simplifying without dropping too many details and organizing things in a
nice straightforward manner. OK, having that out of the way, let us
destroy your skin and challenge your immune system!</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 Defensins are a really interesting beast. There are several
subclasses and they are mostly produced by the border cells of your body
and certain immune cells in battle. So what do they do? Well, they rip
tiny holes into things. Think of them as tiny needles specific to
certain intruders, like bacteria or fungi. So if these needles happen to
encounter a microorganism they inject themselves into it and create a
pore. A small wound, where the victim sort of bleeds a little bit. One
needle will not kill a bacteria, but a few dozen might. Because the
defensins are so specific, they are completely harmless for body cells
but can kill microorganisms completely by themselves.</p>
<p>*2 We’ll talk about viruses in a lot more detail in part 3 of the
book, but since we are already here, we should mention that the way the
skin is built, it is practically immune against viruses. Because these
little parasites can infect only living cells and the surface of your
skin consists only of dead cells, there is nothing to infect here! Only
very few viruses have evolved ways to infect your skin, so bacteria and
fungi are of much greater concern to your skin.</p>
<p>*3 pH—Acids and Bases: pH is one of those things that is often not
properly explained or quickly forgotten once it is. For once, scientists
gave something a great name: pH is short for POWER OF HYDROGEN, which is
exciting and easy to remember. But then scientists decided to abbreviate
it. Disappointing to say the least. Without getting too deep into it,
the POWER OF HYDROGEN is a scale that describes how many hydrogen ions
are present in a water-based solution.</p>
<p>*4 Wait, a footnote inside a footnote? Is this even allowed? Just to
expand on the concept of “power.” Power in this context doesn’t mean
that the hydrogen is extra strong or anything like that. We are dipping
into the wonderful universe of math here. This is “math power,”
correctly called exponential. So going up 1 POWER on the pH scale means
having ten times fewer hydrogen ions. Going up 6 POWER on the pH scale
means having one million times fewer hydrogen ions. (Why is going up the
scale meaning fewer ions? Because the scale is inverted—why make
something easy when it can be complicated?)</p>
<p>A lot of hydrogen ions means that something is acidic: Think of a
tasty lemon or not as tasty battery acid. A low number of hydrogen ions
means something is basic or alkaline, for example soap or bleach, both
not very tasty. In general you don’t want too many or too little
hydrogen ions in a fluid because they will either take or donate
protons. That’s fine in weak acids, like when you squeeze a lemon over
your food to make it taste better, but if a substance is either too
basic or acidic it will act corrosively on your body. Corrosion means
that it will destroy and decompose the structures your cells are made of
and cause chemical burns. Small differences in POWER OF HYDROGEN make a
bigger difference in the world of microbes.</p>
