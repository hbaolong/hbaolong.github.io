<h4 id="the-window-into-the-soul-of-cells">30 The Window into the Soul
of Cells</h4>
<p>Remember in the chapter “Smelling the Building Blocks of Life,” we
learned that cells can smell their environment and recognize intruders
and their excretions with toll-like receptors that can recognize the
shapes of different enemy molecules. They do this so your soldier cells
can detect enemies and kill them efficiently. While this is nice and
all, this leaves still a very significant blind spot, the insides of
infected or corrupted cells.</p>
<p>And being able to tell if a civilian cell should be destroyed is not
relevant only for viral infections. Some species of bacteria, like M.
tuberculosis, actually invade your cells and hide from your immune
system while they eat their victims from the inside out. Then there are
cancer cells that usually appear inconspicuous from the outside while
being broken from the inside. Cells that are infected or corrupted need
to be identified so they can be killed before they can cause large-scale
damage, be it by spreading a pathogen or growing into a tumor. And of
course, who could forget protozoa, our single-celled “animal” friends,
like the trypanosoma that causes sleeping disease or plasmodium that
causes malaria and kills up to half a million people each year.</p>
<p>So, to detect the danger of these corrupted cells, your immune system
has developed an ingenious way that makes it possible for your cells to
look inside other cells. In a nutshell: They do this by bringing the
insides of cells to the outside. Wait, what? How does this work?</p>
<p>To explain exactly how, a short reminder about the nature of cells
might be useful here: Cells are complicated protein machines that
constantly have to rebuild and break down structures and different parts
inside themselves. They are filled up with millions of different
proteins, with many different jobs and functions, that work together in
a beautiful concert of life.</p>
<p>The conductor of this concert is the DNA in the nucleus, and the arms
of this conductor are the mRNA molecules that relay commands that
proteins need to be made. But these proteins are more than just
materials and parts. They tell a story. A story of what is going on
inside a cell. If you could see a cross section of all the proteins of a
cell, you could see what it is doing, what kind of stuff it is currently
building, what notes the conductor wants the orchestra to play. And of
course, if there is something wrong.</p>
<p>If for example a cell is making virus proteins, then it is obviously
infected by a virus. Or if a cell is broken and turns into cancer, it
will start producing faulty or abnormal proteins.*1</p>
<p>But your immune cells can’t look through the solid membrane of your
cell to check what kinds of proteins are being manufactured and if
everything is all right. Nature solved this differently: It brings the
story the proteins tell from the inside to the outside by using a very
special molecule that works like a display window.</p>
<p>This molecule has one of these horrible names of immunology that
might feel very familiar to you:</p>
<p>The Major Histocompatibility Complex class I molecule, or in short
MHC class I molecule. You might have guessed that this molecule is
closely related to the MHC class II molecule that we got to know in
depth earlier. Here immunology has chosen to be extra confusing and
annoying: The two MHC molecule types are crucially important and they
have fundamental differences. MHC class I molecules are display windows.
MHC class II molecules are hot dog buns! Very different things,
annoyingly similar names!</p>
<p>First of all, just like the MHC class II molecule, the job of an MHC
class I molecule is to present antigen. The extremely important
difference between both molecules is: Only antigen-presenting cells have
MHC class II molecules. This includes Dendritic Cells, Macrophages, and
B Cells—all of them immune cells!</p>
<p>This is it—no other cell is allowed to have an MHC class II
molecule.*2</p>
<p>In contrast to that: Every cell of your body that has a nucleus (so
not red blood cells) has MHC class I molecules. OK, why is that and how
does this work?</p>
<p>As we said before, cells are constantly breaking down their proteins
so their parts can be recycled and reused. The crucial thing here is
that while this recycling happens, your cells pick a random selection of
protein pieces and transport them to their membranes to display them on
their surfaces.</p>
<p>The MHC class I molecule showcases these proteins to the outside
world, just like a fancy display window would showcase a selection of
the items the inside of a store has to offer. This way, the protein
story of what is going on inside the cell can be told to the outside. To
make sure the story is always up-to-date, your cells have many thousands
of display windows—or many thousands of MHC class I molecules—and each
one gets refreshed with a new protein, about once a day. Every cell in
your body that has a nucleus and protein-production machines does this
constantly. So your cells constantly showcase what is going on inside
them, to assure the immune system that they are fine. As we will learn
in the next few chapters—there are cells going through your body right
now, checking these windows on random cells, making sure there is no
funny business going on inside them.</p>
<p>Think about how genius of a principle this is and how many problems
this solves. In the case of our influenza A infection the mechanism
works like this: Remember that the first thing the viruses did when they
successfully invaded your cells was to take over the production sites of
the cell. They used the tools and resources of the cell to make virus
protein parts, virus antigens.</p>
<p>Automatically, as a sort of background noise, some of these virus
antigens were picked up and transported to the display windows, the MHC
class I molecules, on the outside of the cell. This way the cell clearly
signaled not only that it is infected but also by whom—although the
enemy is hidden inside and invisible, its antigens are not!</p>
<p>Because all of your cells constantly display proteins in their MHC
class I molecules, infected cells present their insides to the outside
world, even if they don’t “know” that they are infected! The
display-window thing is an automated process that always happens in the
background as part of the normal life of your cells. If an immune cell
wants to check if a cell is infected, it simply can move closer and peer
into the little “windows” to get a snapshot of the inside. If it
recognizes things in the windows that should not be inside the cell, the
infected cell will be killed.</p>
<p>Even better, the number of MHC class I molecules is not fixed. One of
the most important things that happens during the chemical warfare
triggered by interferon is that cells are stimulated and ordered to make
more MHC class I molecules. So in case of an infection, interferon tells
all cells in the vicinity to build more windows and become more
transparent, to tell more of their internal protein story and be more
visible to the immune system.</p>
<p>Another thing that is special about your cell display windows is that
they are a badge of your individuality. We already mentioned in the
first part that the genes that code for MHC molecules, class I and II,
are the most diverse genes of the human species. If you don’t have an
identical twin, it is very likely that your MHC class I molecules are
unique to you specifically. They work the same in all healthy humans,
but the proteins that make up the molecules have hundreds of slightly
different shapes and they are a tiny bit different from person to
person.</p>
<p>This is incredibly important and unfortunate for one thing though:
Organ transplantation. Because the MHC molecules are the place where
your immune system can recognize that a cell on an organ that a generous
person donated to you is not actually you. It is not self, it is other.
And once other is recognized, your immune system will attack and kill
the organ. Something that makes this scenario even more likely is the
nature of organ transplantation.</p>
<p>An organ that is transplanted had to be taken out of another living
being—to do that it had to be separated from it. Usually with sharp
tools. This whole process is likely to have caused small wounds—what do
wounds inside the body trigger? Inflammation, which then attracts the
Innate Immune System. And if things go wrong, the Adaptive Immune System
gets called right to the edges of the new life-saving organ and can call
in more cells that check out the display windows only to find that they
are not yours.</p>
<p>This is the unfortunate reason that after you receive a donated
organ, you need to be on strong medication that suppresses your immune
system for the rest of your life. To minimize the chance that your
immune cells find the foreign MHC class I molecules and kill the cells
carrying them. But of course this will leave you much, much more
vulnerable to infections.</p>
<p>When your immune system evolved hundreds of millions of years ago it
really could not have seen coming that at some point some species of
apes would invent modern medicine and start transplanting hearts and
lungs. But we are getting distracted. Back to the MHC class I molecule,
the window into the cell. Let us meet one of your most dangerous cells
that entirely depends on the display window. A brutal killer from the
Adaptive Immune System that is one of your strongest weapons against
viruses. The Killer T Cell, the murder specialist of your body.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 What is an abnormal protein, you ask? For example certain proteins
are made only when you are an embryo inside your mother’s womb. Some of
these proteins make it possible for embryonic cells to grow and divide
rapidly, something you need at this early stage of life but is
detrimental to you as an adult. The building instructions for these
proteins are still part of the DNA in adult cells—although they are not
used anymore. There is a whole library of proteins like these and their
presence, in anything but embryos, tells the immune system that
something is off. So these proteins are not technically faulty because
they are serving your tumor well, but they are definitely abnormal and
thus a sign of danger for your body.</p>
<p>*2 Hey, how about an immediate exception? There is one more type of
cell in your body that needs MHC class II molecules: The teacher cells
in your Thymus because they need them to educate your Helper T Cells and
make sure they can recognize MHC class II molecules properly!</p>
