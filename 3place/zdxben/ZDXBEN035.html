<h4 id="how-to-boost-your-immune-system">42 How to Boost Your Immune
System</h4>
<p>By now, the immune system has hopefully lost some of its cloudy and
mystic aspects to you. It is not a magic force that can be charged up
like an energy shield or laser weapon, but a complex dance of billions
of parts. A beautiful symphony that has to follow a strict choreography
to function in harmony. Any deviation makes your immune response either
too weak or too powerful, and neither is good for your well-being and
survival. If you read this far you already know more about immunology
than 99% of the general population. So think about it: if you
could—which parts of your immune system would you like to boost?</p>
<p>Would you like more aggressive and stronger Macrophages or
Neutrophils? Well, this would mean more and stronger inflammation, more
fever, more feeling sick and tired even if you encounter only small and
minor infections. How about superstrong Natural Killer Cells to kill
more infected or cancer cells? OK, but they might be so motivated that
they eat away at healthy cells that just happen to be around!</p>
<p>Do you want to boost your Dendritic Cells so that they will start
activating the Adaptive Immune System more? That would drain and exhaust
the resources of your immune system even for small dangers, leaving you
open and vulnerable when a seriously dangerous infection happens.</p>
<p>Or maybe you could boost your T and B Cells, making them much easier
to activate, but which would cause autoimmune diseases as some of these
cells will certainly begin attacking your own tissue. Once your boosted
antibodies and T Cells have begun killing your heart or liver cells they
will not stop until they have finished their job.</p>
<p>Maybe this is all not dangerous enough for you, and you would rather
boost your Mast Cells and the B Cells that produce IgE Antibodies, the
combination of cells that is responsible for allergies. Food that was
only mildly irritating to your bowel will now cause violent diarrhea or
allergic reactions that could kill you in minutes.</p>
<p>Is all of this too boring? Why not think outside of the box and boost
all the regulatory parts of your defense systems so they shut your
immune system down, leaving you open for infections even by the most
harmless pathogens? You probably understand what I’m getting at here:
Boosting the Immune System is a horrible idea that is used by people
trying to make you buy useless stuff!</p>
<p>Luckily the danger is pretty mild that you could actually boost your
immune system since basically nothing you can buy legally actually does
it! Even the mere term “strong immune system” is a misnomer. Over
everything else, you want a balanced immune system. Homeostasis.
Aggression and calmness. You want elegant dancers who remember the
choreography really well over pumped-up rugby players who want to smash
stuff. In all likelihood, your immune system works exactly as
intended.</p>
<p>OK now, wait. If boosting the immune system is so crazy complicated
and dangerous, why is the internet filled with products that promise to
do exactly that?</p>
<p>From infused coffee to protein powder, mystical roots dug up in the
Amazon rainforest, or vitamin pills, there are an endless amount of
things you can buy to “boost” your immune system.</p>
<p>In reality, nobody knows how many cells of which kinds and at what
activity level are necessary to have your specific immune system work
optimally. Anybody who says that they know what is needed is probably
trying to sell you something.</p>
<p>At least for now, there are no scientifically proven ways to directly
boost your immune system with any products that are easily available.
And if there were, it would be very dangerous to use them without
medical supervision.</p>
<p>The most important thing you need to do to have a healthy immune
system is to eat a diet that provides you with all the vitamins and
nutrients your body needs. The reason is, simply, your immune system
constantly makes many billions of new cells. And all these newborn cells
need resources to function properly. Malnutrition is strongly associated
with a weak immune system. If you are starving, you are more susceptible
to infections and diseases because your body has to make hard decisions
and the immune system suffers from that.</p>
<p>But if you eat at least somewhat of a balanced diet with some fruits
and vegetables, you will get all the micro and macronutrients for your
immune system to work just fine. Interestingly, even in developed
countries there is micronutrient malnutrition, especially among elderly
people. Which just means that someone has a deficiency of essential
nutrients and vitamins—usually because they don’t eat enough or have too
little variety in their diets. So only eating pizza is not healthy but
this should already have been clear. In all likelihood if you eat sort
of OK, your immune system works just as it should.</p>
<p>On top of just eating right, the positive health effects of even
moderate regular exercise have been known for a long time. Your body is
made for movement and so moving it around a bit keeps a variety of
systems in good health, especially your cardiovascular system. Working
out also directly boosts your immune system, because it promotes good
circulations of fluids throughout your body. In a nutshell, just by
moving, stretching, and squashing your various body parts, your fluids
flow better and more freely than if you lie on your couch all day. And
good circulation is good for the immune system because it allows your
cells and immune proteins to move more efficiently and freely, which
makes them do their job better.</p>
<p>But that is what you can do basically.</p>
<p>Some people actually do have deficits and benefit from certain
supplements but this is nothing you can self-diagnose. The bitter
reality is that humans are very different and the reasons why different
changes in diet or lifestyle may have a positive or negative effect on
you are way too complex to summarize in a general book about the immune
system.</p>
<p>If you feel like you have a shortage of a vitamin or microelement or
something, this is something you should discuss with your doctor in real
life.</p>
<p>This blanket statement will leave many people unsatisfied. How is it
possible that humans can fly to the moon, that we can build particle
accelerators, and that we came up with 980 different Pokémon but we
can’t improve our immune system?</p>
<p>Well, look at it like this: If you have an old rusty car that you
have used for off-roading for decades, with a broken axle, blown-out
tires, and a busted headlight, do you think you could fix it by putting
special gas in its tank and slapping on a new finish? You can’t undo the
damage that you caused by treating a car really badly through magic. If
you want your car to run better and longer, just take care of it and,
you may have guessed it, your body is exactly the same.</p>
<p>If you want to “boost” your immune system so that it is healthy,
start by taking better care of yourself by living a healthy lifestyle,
and the complex concert of your immune system, with all its billions of
different parts, will run properly for a longer time. Not forever
unfortunately, neither cars nor humans are made for that. But longer and
better. This is what science has to say about this topic, at least for
now.</p>
<p>Talking about boosting the immune system and the unscientific claims
made by many people working in the multibillion-dollar industry of
selling supplements would be mildly funny, as the majority of people at
worst are wasting money. Unfortunately there are millions of people who
suffer from real and serious diseases that are anything but funny, from
cancer to autoimmunity.</p>
<p>And these people, who often are desperate to alleviate their symptoms
or are just frankly trying to survive, are the ones who might fall
victim to the empty promises of the supplement industry. Even worse,
some might even go as far as to disregard real medical treatment as a
consequence of these lies supported by greed or well-meaning but
ill-advised appeals to naturalism. These broken ideas about health and
boosting the immune system can be perpetuated only by our collective
misunderstanding of the mechanisms of our own immune system and what it
actually is.</p>
<p>Even experts have to be very careful if they want to attempt to boost
the immune system and this might be the right moment to tell a story
where it all went horribly wrong.</p>
<p>As the knowledge of the mechanisms of our immune system grew
massively in the last few decades, scientists tried to come up with new
ways to fight the diseases that haunt us. If we could just manipulate
our intricate defense system the benefits to our species would be
enormous. But as we said, manipulating the immune system is very
dangerous. It is constantly performing a balancing act between too harsh
and too mild and trying to interfere can go horribly wrong.</p>
<p>An infamous example is TGN1412, a drug trial that went so horribly
wrong that it reached beyond the sphere of immunology and got some
headlines in newspapers. The trial was supposed to look for side effects
in humans taking a drug that was supposed to stimulate T Cells in cancer
patients and make them survive longer.</p>
<p>The drug was an artificial antibody that was able to connect to and
stimulate the CD28 molecule on T Cells—we already met CD28 before
without naming it—one of the signals T Cells need to be activated. We
described it as a gentle kiss the Dendritic Cell needs to give a T Cell
to activate it.</p>
<p>So the idea of TGN1412 is pretty straightforward: Give T Cells an
artificial “kiss” to stimulate them to be more effective and easier to
activate in cancer patients. Basically “boosting” their immune system to
be more formidable in the face of this life-threatening disease. And
yeah, well, boost it did.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, the amount of TGN1412 administered was 500 times
lower than the dose that had led to any reaction in macaques (which is a
cute species of monkeys, if you are wondering) and so the researchers
doing the drug trials did not expect any real reaction to occur in the
human volunteers.</p>
<p>But instead, minutes after TGN1412 was given to healthy young men,
all hell broke loose. It turned out macaques, the animals used to test
the drug in animal models, happen to have way fewer CD28 molecules on
their T Cells than humans and so they reacted way less strongly to the
drug than expected, creating a false sense of security. Also, for some
reason the drug was administered ten times faster to the human
volunteers than it had been in the animal model.*</p>
<p>Within minutes the volunteers experienced an extremely strong
cytokine release syndrome, which is a cytokine storm on speed. All over
their bodies, billions of immune cells that usually require careful
activation, guarded by the safeguards we discussed in this book, all
awoke at once. Basically, all the T Cells in the volunteers’ bodies were
overstimulated and released an onslaught of activating and inflammatory
cytokines. These great floods of cytokines activated more immune cells,
which then themselves released more cytokines and caused more
inflammation. A horrible chain reaction that was self-perpetuating and
accelerating.</p>
<p>The immune system of the volunteers had been released and nobody was
prepared for what was happening. In a rapid, violent, and systemic
reaction, fluid rushed from their blood into tissue all over their
bodies, making them swell up as they were writhing in excruciating pain.
What followed was multiorgan failure and the volunteers could only be
kept alive by machines and huge doses of drugs that shut down the immune
system. One of the worst-affected volunteers suffered from heart, liver,
and kidney failure all at once and would later go on to lose many toes
and some fingertips. Luckily, all of the six volunteers survived this
horrible day, and after a few weeks of intensive care, most of them were
able to leave the hospital again.</p>
<p>As the TGN1412 trial failed in the most horrible way possible, it
obviously sent shockwaves through the medical research community. Many
guidelines for human trials were amended as a consequence of this.</p>
<p>OK, so what is the purpose of this horror story? Certainly not to say
that drugs that boost the immune system are a bad idea in general, but
it teaches us about the complexity and dangers of using them. If we look
at the scale and mind-bending level of detail and complex interactions
of your immune system, the magnitude of the challenge to manipulate it
becomes clear. Make no mistake—while we did discuss a lot of things in
this book, I still massively simplified everything. We barely scratched
the surface from the perspective of actual immunologists that are
working in the trenches of immunology.</p>
<p>Think of the immune system as a crazy large machine with thousands of
levers and hundreds of dials. Billions of gears and screws and wheels
and blinking lights that are interacting inside it constantly. Pull any
lever and you just don’t know for sure what sort of downstream
interactions you will cause.</p>
<p>OK, so boosting and strengthening the immune system is complicated
for experts, and outside of a healthy lifestyle is pretty impossible
(and ill-advised) for regular people. But there is actually a huge thing
you could do to at least prevent damage. It turns out that many people
are actually suppressing their immune system without being aware of
it.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Somewhere in this book this needs to be mentioned and we might as
well do it here. Beware headlines about anything health related that
mentions animal models. Yes, it is crucially important to test drugs in
animals, but unsurprisingly, animals and humans are different. Yes, we
have created mice with immune systems that basically mirror our human
immune system, yes, we have monkeys like macaques that live on an
evolutionary branch that is not that far away from ours, but these are
still completely different organisms. There are all kinds of drugs that
heal mice or prolong their lives and do whatnot—but do nothing at all
for humans. Or worse, they are dangerous or even deadly for us. So
again, this is not saying that these experiments are not critically
important, unbelievably important knowledge has been gained through
animal models. But when it comes to drugs and cures, everything can be
different once a drug is used by humans. So if you hear news about some
kind of amazing drug, make sure to check if the excitement is based on
human trials or if it is still in an earlier stage, tested in
animals.</li>
