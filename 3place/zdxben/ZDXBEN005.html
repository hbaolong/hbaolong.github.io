<h4 id="the-empires-and-kingdoms-of-the-immune-system">4 The Empires and
Kingdoms of the Immune System</h4>
<p>Imagine you were the grand architect of the immune system. Your job
is to organize the defenses against millions of intruders that want to
take it over. You get to build whatever defenses you like, although the
accountants remind you that the body is on a tight energy budget, has no
resources to spare, and they kindly ask you to not be wasteful. How
would you approach this monumental task? What kind of forces would you
put at the front and which ones would you hold in reserve? How would you
make sure that you could react strongly to a sudden invasion but also
prevent your army from exhausting itself too quickly? How would you deal
with the massive scope of the body and the millions of different enemies
you would have to account for? Luckily, your immune system has found
many beautiful and elegant solutions for these problems.</p>
<p>As we alluded to in the last chapter, the immune system is not a
singular thing but many different things. Hundreds of tiny organs and a
few bigger ones, a network of vessels and tissues, billions of cells
with dozens of specializations and quintillions of free-floating
proteins.*</p>
<p>All these parts form different and overlapping layers and systems, so
it’s helpful to imagine them as empires and kingdoms that, in unison,
defend the continent that is your body. We can organize them into two
very different realms that together represent the most powerful and
ingenious principles that nature found to defend your continent of
flesh: The Realm of your Innate Immune System and the Realm of your
Adaptive Immune System.</p>
<p>The Realm of the Innate Immune System contains all the defenses you
are born with and that can be employed mere seconds after an invasion
occurs. These are the basic defenses that go back to the very first
multicellular animals on earth and they are absolutely crucial for your
survival. One of its most central features is that it is the sort of
smart part of your immune system. It has the power to tell self from
other. And once it detects other it immediately springs into action.
However, its weapons are not tailored to identify any specific enemy,
but instead they try to be effective across a wide range of common
enemies. It doesn’t have specific weapons against specific types of E.
coli bacteria, for example, but against bacteria in general. It’s
designed to be as widely effective as possible. Think of it like your
basic starter kit: it has all the fundamentals, not the specialized
items you’d get with an advanced kit. But without the fundamentals, the
specialized items are all but useless.</p>
<p>Without your Innate Immune System, you would be overwhelmed and
killed by microorganisms within days or weeks. It does the heavy lifting
and most of the actual fighting. The vast majority of your hundreds of
billions of soldier and guard cells are part of your innate immune
system. These are pretty rough fellows that prefer bashing in heads over
talking and thinking. Most microorganisms that successfully invade you
are killed by your innate immune system without you even noticing. Since
the Innate Immune System is the first line of defense it is not just
responsible for throwing soldiers at danger, it also has to make crucial
decisions: How dangerous an invasion? What kind of enemy is attacking?
And are more heavy weapons necessary?</p>
<p>These decisions are vital because they influence what sort of weapons
your immune system as a whole will deploy. A bacterial invasion needs a
very different response than a viral invasion. So while a fight is going
on, the Innate Immune System gathers intel and data and then it makes
the decisions that in many cases will decide your fate. If your innate
immune system thinks an attack is serious enough, it has the power to
activate and call the second line of defense to mobilize and join the
fight.</p>
<p>The Realm of the Adaptive Immune System contains specialized super
cells that coordinate and support your first line of defense. It
contains factories that produce heavy protein weapons and special cells
that hunt and kill infected body cells in the case of viral infections.
Its defining feature is that it is specific. Unbelievably specific, in
fact. Your Adaptive Immune System “knows” every possible intruder. Its
name, what it had for breakfast, its favorite color, its most intimate
hopes and dreams. The Adaptive Immune System has a specific answer for
every single possible microorganism that exists on this planet right
now—and for every single one that can evolve in the future. Think about
how creepy that actually is. If you were a bacteria, for example, all
you would want is to get into a human and find a place to make babies
but suddenly there are agents that know your name, your face, your
personal history, and all of your most intimate secrets and they are
armed to the teeth.</p>
<p>This breathtakingly specific defense and how it works will be a focus
of future chapters, but for now, just remember that your Adaptive Immune
System possesses the largest library in the known universe, with an
entry for every current and future possible enemy. But not only that, it
also is able to remember everything about an enemy that showed up only
once. It is the reason most diseases are only able to manifest
themselves once in your life. But this knowledge and complexity come
with downsides.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Innate Immune System, your Adaptive Immune System
is not ready yet when you are born. It needs to be trained and refined
over many years. It starts as a blank slate and then gets progressively
more powerful, only to get weaker again as you age. A weak Adaptive
Immune System is one of the main reasons young and old humans are often
much more likely to die from diseases than people in the middle of their
lives. Mothers actually lend their newborn babies a bit of their
adaptive immunity in their mother’s milk to help them survive and give
them some protection!</p>
<p>While it is easy to think of the Adaptive Immune System as your more
sophisticated defense, one of the most important things it actually does
is to make your innate defenses stronger by motivating your innate
soldier cells to fight harder and more efficiently (but more on that
later).</p>
<p>For now, let’s summarize: Your Immune System consists of two major
realms: Innate and Adaptive Immunity. Your Innate Immune System is ready
to fight after birth, and can identify if an enemy is not self, but
other. It does the down-and-dirty hand-to-hand combat, but it also
determines what broad category your enemies fall in and how dangerous
they are. And finally it has the power to activate your second line of
defense: Your Adaptive Immune System, which needs a few years before it
is ready to deploy efficiently. It is specific and can draw from an
incredibly large library to fight every possible individual enemy that
nature can throw at it, with powerful superweapons. But while it is
powerful, one of its most important jobs is to make the Innate Immune
System even stronger.</p>
<p>Both of these realms are interconnected in a deep and stunningly
complex way. And it is in the interactions between these two systems
wherein lies some of the magic and beauty of your immune system.</p>
<p>To explore the different realms with the attention they deserve, the
rest of this book is organized into three major parts. In part 2 we will
experience an invasion that will occur through your skin and by bacteria
and in part 3 we will witness a sneaky surprise attack on your mucosa by
viruses. In part 4 we will then see how everything comes together and
discuss specific disorders and diseases, from autoimmune to cancer.</p>
<p>So now let us see what happens if your borders are breached.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>So you have probably heard that you have white blood cells and they
are your immune cells or something like that. Well, while this name has
its use in the right context it just generally means “the cells of the
immune system” and I don’t think immunology has done itself a favor with
this term. “White blood cells” describes so many different cells that do
so many different things that it is sort of useless if you want to
understand what is really going on here. So you can forget “white blood
cells” again because we are not going to use it.</li>
