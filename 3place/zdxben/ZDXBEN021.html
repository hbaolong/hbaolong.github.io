<h4 id="the-immune-system-of-your-lungs">27 The Immune System of Your
Lungs</h4>
<p>Though it’s fun to imagine, your lungs are actually not big balloons,
but in a way much like dense sponges with countless nooks and crannies.
The parts of your lungs that do the actual breathing have an enormous
surface area, in excess of 145 square yards (120 square meters)—more
than sixty times the surface of your skin.</p>
<p>This vast space constantly interacts with the environment as you
inhale a couple thousand gallons of air every day. As a consequence,
your lungs are one of the most exposed places of the whole body. Each
breath takes in about a pint (500 milliliters) of air, made up not only
of the oxygen you need but also a few other gases that your body doesn’t
care about, and a plethora of particles. Exactly what stuff you are
breathing in, and how much of that stuff, depends strongly on where you
are in the world.</p>
<p>While in the cold of the Antarctic the air will be as fresh as it can
be, consisting mostly of clean atmosphere. Walking on the busy streets
of an inner city, you breathe in a wild mix of toxic exhaust gases, all
sorts of particles from cars, and other aggressive materials like
asbestos or the rubber abrasions from tires. Aside from this artificial
pollution, air can carry a large number of allergens like the pollen
from various plants or the dust in our homes, spiked with the droppings
of mites.</p>
<p>Bacteria, viruses, and the spores of fungi are also riding on these
particles or fine droplets of water, or are just floating around by
themselves, looking for a new home. So the cells lining your lungs are
constantly confronted with an onslaught of toxic chemicals, particles,
and microorganisms. While in other areas of the body the immune system
would react massively if it were confronted by this explosive mixture,
damaging tissue without that much regard, in the lungs this is not a
great option. No matter what you do, you can’t stop breathing.</p>
<p>So your immune system has to be more careful here, less brutal. A
balanced system had to evolve in your lungs—able to fend off intruders
and clear up the pollution while still allowing for the exchange of
gases.</p>
<p>The defenses of your respiratory system begin in the nose, with a
pretty large filter of actual hair—not useful against anything small but
meant to keep big things from entering. Like large enough dust particles
or pollen for example. Then, as in any mucosal environment, the mucus is
covering the surfaces and in your respiratory system can be rapidly
expelled by the explosive sneezing reflex.</p>
<p>The mucus is being moved constantly either outside or swallowed. In
the deeper parts of your lungs these mechanisms are not useful though
because to breathe, your alveoli, tiny sacs full of air, can’t be
covered by mucosa or breathing would not be possible. So at your deepest
and most vulnerable places in your lungs, there is literally only a
single layer of epithelial cells between the inside and the outside and
nothing else. Talk about an exposed area. A perfect target for all sorts
of pathogens.</p>
<p>To keep the area safe a very special type of Macrophage is stationed
here: The Alveolar Macrophage. Its main job is patrolling the surface of
your lungs and picking up trash. Most detritus and other unpleasant
stuff are caught in the mucosa of the upper respiratory system, but some
of it still reaches the deeper parts. Alveolar Macrophages are
extra-chill Macrophages. They are much harder to provoke and activate
than their cousins in your skin. In airways they downregulate other
immune cells like Neutrophils and make them less aggressive. But most
importantly, they tone down any sort of inflammation. Because the thing
you really don’t want in your lungs is fluid.</p>
<p>There is evidence that your lungs might have a microbiome (which
means a collective of microbes that live in your lungs), or at least
some sort of transient community of organisms that live in your lungs
and is tolerated. But in contrast to the gut microbiome, we still know
very little about the lung microbiome. This has multiple reasons. For
one, on the microscale breathing is a hurricane-level storm that occurs
constantly, so it is much harder for microbes to make their home here
than in the chill gut. Then there are much fewer free resources and
friendly bacteria have a much harder time making a living. But one of
the biggest problems holding us back is that it is pretty hard to
collect samples from the deep lung microbiome. You really need to
appreciate how easy it is to collect stuff from the gut: Your gut is a
long, wide tube and every day a happy sample of everything inside leaves
through your butt. Your lungs are not nearly as cooperative and it is
also pretty hard to collect samples from the deeper parts without
contaminating them on the way out. So there is still a lot to learn
about the microbiome and its interactions with the lung.</p>
<p>What we know for sure, though, is that a lot of the most common and
dangerous pathogenic viruses that infect humans use the respiratory
system as an entry point. So now that we have gotten an idea of the
environment of your lungs, let us see what happens if they are infected
and learn what sort of special defenses your immune system has found to
wipe them out.</p>
<p>28 The Flu—The “Harmless” Virus You Don’t Respect Enough</p>
<p>“Only three more days until the weekend!” you think, as you enter the
break room where one of your colleagues is making coffee. Just as you
pass her, she suddenly coughs violently, quickly covering her face with
the crook of the arm, but not fast enough—the first cough hit the air
unhindered and a fine cloud, made up of hundreds of droplets, shot
through the air. On the scale of cells, these droplets are not like
bullets but more like intercontinental ballistic missiles, traveling a
distance equivalent to continents in seconds. And they are not filled
with nuclear warheads, but an equally dangerous load: millions of
influenza A viruses that cause a disease we know as the flu.*1</p>
<p>The larger and heavier droplet warheads don’t get very far, soon
hitting the ground. But the lighter ones spread out through the air
carried by favorable air flows. You don’t notice any of this as you walk
right through the cloud of droplets. You breathe in, and a few dozen of
the virus-filled missiles are sucked into your airways and violently
splash onto your mucous membranes, where they release their viral load.
You just make your coffee without realizing what a serious sequence of
events has just been triggered. A bit later, as you begin to consider
getting another cup, the first virus takes over one of your cells.</p>
<p>It will be the first of billions.</p>
<p>The influenza A virus that you breathed in so casually belongs to one
of the most powerful and consistently dangerous strains of the very
annoying family of Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza A has specialized in
infecting the epithelial cells of the respiratory system in mammals.
Since this includes humans, influenza A has been responsible for four
major influenza pandemics in the twentieth century alone, the most
famous one being the Spanish flu that killed at least 40 million people.
Lucky for you, the strain you just breathed in is not that deadly. On
average the “regular” flu that we have gotten used to “only” kills up to
half a million people each year.*2</p>
<p>For the viruses that entered your respiratory system in the break
room, a crucial timer begins. They have only a few hours to reach their
goal because the environment of the swamp kingdom is slowly but surely
destroying them. Various proteins or antibodies that float around here
can dismantle them or render them useless and they are being carried
away with the mucus layer that is constantly replenished. And so, many
of the virus particles that you breathed in never reach their goal
because they are caught and destroyed in time. But in truly dramatic
fashion, a single one of the viruses reaches the cells below the
protective mucus.</p>
<p>Your epithelial cells, the “skin” of your insides, have receptors on
their surfaces that the influenza A viruses can connect to and
manipulate to enter the cells. It takes the virus only about an hour to
gain control over the cell by conquering its natural processes. Without
knowing what it is doing, the cell carefully wraps the virus inside a
package and pulls it deep inside towards its nucleus, the brain of the
cell. Natural processes, again triggered by the cell itself, signal to
the virus when it has reached its destination and when it has to release
its genetic code and a bunch of different hostile virus proteins.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes the influenza tricks the cell into delivering its
genetic material directly into the brain of the cell, the nucleus. Viral
proteins begin to dismantle the cell’s internal antivirus defenses, and
with that, the cell has been conquered.</p>
<p>The influenza A virus is trying to directly take over the nucleus,
which is the brain of your cell, if you will. It stores the DNA, which
carries the instruction manuals for all the proteins of the cell, but
not just blueprints but also their production cycles. These proteins
determine the development, function, growth, behavior, and reproduction
of your cell. So whoever controls the protein production controls the
cell itself. How does this work? Well, your DNA consists of smaller
sections, your genes, and each gene is the instruction for one protein.
To turn the instructions from a gene into an actual protein, this
information needs to be transmitted to the protein production machinery
in the cell.</p>
<p>How do genes transmit information? Well, they technically don’t do
anything because genes are just sections of your DNA. To communicate the
information stored in a gene to the rest of the cell, living things use
RNA. RNA is a complex and fascinating molecule that fulfills a variety
of different and crucial jobs. The one we care about in this context is
to act as messengers that relay the building instructions from genes to
the protein factories of your cells.</p>
<p>And here viruses come in and screw everything up. Viruses try to take
over this beautiful natural process in a multitude of ways, depending on
their modus operandi. The influenza virus A, for example, just dumps a
number of RNA molecules into the nucleus, where it pretends to be
commissioned from your own genes and tricks the cell into building
specific viral proteins. But of course the viral proteins are harmful
and interrupt the production of healthy cell proteins and instead
produce virus proteins, or in other words, virus parts.*3</p>
<p>In our story, the influenza A virus that infected the epithelial cell
has been successful and the fate of the poor cell is now sealed. It has
become a dangerous time bomb for your body, a protein robot that does
not serve you any longer, but now serves a new and sinister master.</p>
<p>For a few hours, processes and production lines are changed and
molded for their new purpose before mass production of new viruses
begins. According to some estimates, a single cell infected by influenza
A, is, on average, able to produce enough viruses to successfully infect
twenty-two new cells before the first victim cell dies from exhaustion
after a few hours.</p>
<p>If we assume this process plays out without resistance (and each
virus infects only uninfected cells) then one infected cell becomes 22,
which then become 484 infected cells. Then 484 turn into 10,648, which
turn into 234,256, which turn into 5,153,632. In just five reproductive
cycles, each taking about half a day, a single virus has turned into
millions. (In practice this will not always pan out like that since your
body will not just let this happen—but then again, you probably will
have more than one influenza virus being successful in infecting your
cells initially. So millions of infected cells is probably not far
off.)*4</p>
<p>Viruses are just something else when it comes to exponential growth.
They play in their own league where they can multiply explosively in
large bursts, rather than in a binary fashion like bacteria, for
example.</p>
<p>Speaking of bacteria, in contrast to the very straightforward
battlefield when we stepped on a nail, the situation is very different
with viruses.</p>
<p>If you cut yourself and bacteria infect your wound, things are pretty
straightforward: There is damage that immediately causes inflammation
and attracts the immune system and there are a lot of enemies that don’t
exactly act super discreet but more like a bunch of drunk toddlers in a
candy shop.*5</p>
<p>Viruses don’t want attention. The beginnings of an influenza A
infection are less of a full frontal attack and more like an invasion by
a bunch of commandos trying to stay undetected and silently taking out
your defenses.</p>
<p>Think about the legend about the ancient Greeks trying to conquer the
city of Troy thousands of years ago, the one with the wooden horse. If
you imagine Troy as your body, the siege and attacks with open field
battles in front of the city gates is what most bacteria do—running
around screaming and having their heads bashed in by defenders who are
very annoyed with them.</p>
<p>The influenza virus is more like the soldiers hiding inside the
Trojan horse, trying to enter the city as sneakily as possible, doing
everything to stay hidden. Once they are inside they wait until
nightfall and try to sneak from house to house to kill the Trojan
citizens in their sleep before they can alert the city guard about the
invasion. Every house they take over becomes a base for the intruders
that creates more invading soldiers, and every night more of them try to
silently take over more houses and to kill more citizens in their sleep.
OK, at this point the metaphor breaks down a little, but you get the
gist.</p>
<p>In a nutshell this is a major feature of an infection by pathogenic
viruses. This sneaky approach also means that the battlefield is very
different in the case of a serious viral infection than what we
encountered with bacteria. If we look around at the site of freshly
infected lung tissue, we don’t see anything. Just seemingly healthy
cells doing their thing while hidden enemies are slitting throats and
disabling defenses inside the cells. In a very real way, this makes
viral infections much crueler and more insidious than bacteria barging
into an open wound.</p>
<p>Pathogenic viruses are truly scary enemies. They attack your weakest
links and hide inside civilians, where they proliferate much, much more
explosively than other pathogens and can infect countless cells with
every new reproductive cycle. At the height of a virus infection, you
can have billions of viruses inside your body. All of these special
properties require your immune system to defend against them differently
than against most bacteria.</p>
<p>But don’t get too scared. Your immune system has evolved special
antivirus defenses.</p>
<p>At this point, maybe a few dozen cells have been infected, but the
first countermeasures are already booting up. This early on in the
infection there is a struggle between your infected cells that want to
alert the immune system and the virus that tries to silence them.</p>
<p>To return to our Troy metaphor, the peaceful slumbering citizens of
the city wake up to the sound of enemy soldiers sneaking into their
homes and trying to slit their throats. So before this can happen they
run to the windows and try to alert the town guard by crying out a loud
warning. But just as the citizens want to scream, the intruders
violently pull them from the windows and silence them forever with stabs
and cuts. A desperate struggle for control for every single house and
every single citizen plays out. If the citizens win and manage to call
for the guards, the immune system will awaken; if the sneaky intruders
win, they will gain the time they need to create more warriors and
become a real danger to the whole city.</p>
<p>OK, houses and soldiers and citizens, screaming and struggling and
stabbing. What is actually going on here and what sort of thing is the
metaphor describing? Once again we are about to encounter a wonderfully
elegant solution to an incredibly complicated problem.</p>
<p>The first real defense of your body against viruses is Chemical
Warfare!</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 The name influenza means “influence” in Italian and stems from a
time in the Middle Ages when people thought that the influence of
astronomical events could affect your health and cause diseases. For
example, liquid flowing off the stars and into Earth and then humans
somehow. Almost as crazy as the idea that the positions of stars when
you were born have an influence on your character and personality
traits.</p>
<p>*2 The Spanish flu was special because it turned the tables a little
bit—usually the flu kills mostly small kids and older adults but in this
case the opposite happened. If you were a healthy adult in your prime
you had the highest chance of dying from the Spanish flu. The disease
was the hardest on the healthiest people because it made their immune
systems flip out and lose all constraint, leading to an overall
mortality rate of roughly 10%.</p>
<p>*3 With viruses we have now truly entered the intimate and
mind-bending world of biochemistry. Cells are made from millions of
parts moved by thousands of processes going on at the same time, in a
complex and wonderful dance that we call life. Viruses interfere here in
ways that are stunningly complex and complicated. If we were to go into
detail, we would encounter viral proteins and molecules with horrible
names like vRNPs, viral polymerase complexes like PB1, PB2, or PA, viral
membrane proteins HA, NA, or M2, polypeptides like HA1 and HA2. This
stuff is fascinating but it also requires a multiple-page-long discourse
about the detailed inner workings of your cells and how viral parts
interact and manipulate them. It is just a layer of complexity that is
not necessary to get the principles at play here. You really need to
remember only one thing: The virus is basically performing a hostile
takeover of the machinery of your cell.</p>
<p>*4 So as we are talking about millions of infected body cells, what
does it mean to you in a practical sense? How much of your lung is
infected at this point? How big is a patch of a million infected
epithelial cells? Very roughly, a million infected epithelial cells have
a surface area of half an inch (1.2 centimeters). This is roughly less
than half of the surface area of a Lincoln penny or a Euro cent. In
total your lungs have a surface area of about 84 square yards (70 square
meters), which is just short of a badminton court. So actually only a
tiny amount of your lungs has been infected at this point. It becomes
scary again if you remember how tiny a cell is and how quickly this
scaled up from basically nothing. If the virus was allowed to grow at
this rate your whole lung would be infected in no time and you would be
very dead.</p>
<p>*5 OK, OK, that is slightly unfair. Not all bacteria are like clumsy
idiots, many pathogenic ones have arguably genius strategies for hiding
and striking hard when the time is right. A very cool example is quorum
sensing. In a nutshell, this means that pathogenic bacteria invade a
tissue but are very discreet. Like they control themselves and the
metabolism strictly while they divide, downregulating all sorts of
metabolic products (bacteria poop) and hiding their dangerous weapons
that could reveal them to the immune system. They do that by waiting for
a chemical signal that tells them to attack at the right moment. When a
critical mass is reached they suddenly and all at once stop their
secretive behavior. Now they are no longer a small threat that could be
taken care of easily but a formidable army, and they lose the constraint
all at once. If they behaved like that from the get-go they would have
been attacked and probably killed right away. So yeah, quorum sensing is
pretty cool and bacteria have more than one strategy.</p>
<p>29 Chemical Warfare: Interferons, Interfere!</p>
<p>Just like the citizens of Troy desperately fought the Greek soldiers
that snuck into their city, your cells fight tooth and nail against the
influenza virus that is inside them.</p>
<p>The first step in this struggle for your cells is to be able to
realize that they have been invaded. And since the epithelial cells that
line your mucous membranes are such a prime target for virus invasions,
they are actually prepared! As we mentioned before, epithelial cells are
a sort of militia. And as such, they do possess pattern-recognition
receptors similar to the toll-like receptors that we got to know early
in this book. These are the receptors of the innate immune cells that
can recognize the most common shapes from enemies like viruses. Your
epithelial cells have a bunch of different receptors that scan their own
insides for red flags.</p>
<p>If they connect to certain viral proteins or molecules they know that
something has invaded them and that something is massively wrong, which
triggers an immediate emergency response.</p>
<p>Right then, your body has to confront a serious problem with viral
infections. The innate immune system is not nearly as effective against
pathogenic viruses as it is against bacteria. So in the case of
pathogenic virus infections (or bacteria who hide inside cells), your
body desperately needs help from the adaptive immune system to stand a
chance of clearing an invasion.</p>
<p>But as we have learned by now, the adaptive immune system is slow and
needs a few days to wake up, which is not ideal if you consider how
quickly viruses multiply. So in case of a serious viral infection, your
innate immune system and the infected civilian cells need to fight for
the most valuable thing in the universe: Time. They need to slow down
the infection and make it as hard as possible for the virus to spread
further to more civilians.</p>
<p>And now we finally get to the way your cells do this: chemical
warfare.</p>
<p>We talked about cytokines a bunch in this book—the amazing proteins
that transmit information, activate cells, lead cells to the site of a
skirmish, or make immune cells change their behavior. In short,
cytokines are the molecules that activate and guide your immune system.
They also do this in the case of a virus infection, but they actually
play an arguably greater role here.</p>
<p>If one of your cells realizes that it is infected by a virus, it
immediately releases a number of different emergency cytokines to the
cells surrounding it and to the immune system. Those cytokines are the
civilian shriek upon seeing the intruders at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different cytokines that are released in this
situation and they do a lot of different things but here we want to
highlight a very special class: Interferons. Interferons got their name
from “interfere.” They are cytokines that are interfering with
viruses.</p>
<p>In a sense you can imagine interferons as a warning echoing down the
streets of the city, calling citizens to lock their doors and move
furniture in front of it, to board up their windows and anticipate an
attack by soldiers. Interferons are the ultimate “get ready for a virus”
signal.</p>
<p>So when cells pick up interferon molecules, it triggers different
pathways that make them change their behavior drastically. One important
thing to understand here is that at this point it is impossible for your
body to deduct how many viruses are present, how many cells they have
invaded, or how many cells are already producing new viruses in
secret.</p>
<p>So one of the first changes is for the cells to temporarily shut down
protein production. Every moment of your life your cells are recycling
and reconstructing their internal building blocks and materials to make
sure every protein is in good shape and works as intended. So some
interferons tell cells to chill out a bit and to slow down the
production of new proteins. If a cell doesn’t build a lot of proteins,
it can’t build a lot of virus proteins if it happens to be infected
already. So basically just by ordering cells to slow down, interferon
slows down the production of viruses considerably.</p>
<p>There are more examples of targeted interventions and we could go
into even more detail here, as there are dozens of different interferons
that do dozens of different things, but in the end it doesn’t matter
that much. What is important for you to take away here is that
interferons interfere with every step of viral replication.</p>
<p>Interferons will seldomly eradicate an infection by themselves, but
they don’t have to. All they have to do is slow down the multiplication
of new viruses by making cells in the vicinity much more resistant to
the virus infection. And sometimes this response is enough to prevent
the spread of a virus infection so efficiently that it goes nowhere and
you’ll never even know anything happened at all.</p>
<p>In the case of our break room influenza A infection, this is not the
case unfortunately. The influenza virus has adapted to the human immune
system and comes prepared. When it unloaded its genetic information to
take over the cell, it also came prepacked with a bunch of different
viral “attack” proteins. These weapons are able to destroy and block the
internal defense mechanism of the infected cells. You can imagine these
attack proteins as the daggers of the soldiers invading the
houses—effective tools to prevent screaming (cytokine release) by doing
a bit of stabbing.</p>
<p>So while the influenza A virus is not always successful in preventing
the release of interferons, it is very good at delaying it and buying
more time for itself. Isn’t this fascinating if you think about it? Two
very different enemies, a virus and a human cell, and both are
struggling with each other for time.</p>
<p>Influenza A is very good at this struggle and so often a few dozen
viruses become tens of thousands in hours. Still, the initial tactic of
staying as hidden as possible has the downside that even if it is
successful initially, it will fail after a while. It cannot stay hidden
forever. The more cells the virus infects, the more civilians will be
able to activate chemical warfare, the more civilian cells will die
eventually, which triggers inflammation and activates the immune system
by itself, and the more virus particles will float around in the fluids
between the cells, triggering red flags. So even the sneakiest virus
will be detected sooner or later.</p>
<p>Usually sooner, because chemical warfare triggers the next step on
the escalation ladder of the antivirus section of your Innate Immune
System: Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells.*1</p>
<p>These special cells spend their lives moving through your blood or
camp out in the lymphatic network, scanning specifically for signs of
viruses—panic interferons from civilian cells or just straight up
viruses that float around in your fluids. In any case, if they do pick
up signs of a viral infection, they activate and turn into chemical
power plants that ooze out extreme amounts of interferons, alerting not
only civilians to turn on their antiviral modes (shut down protein
production, etc.) but also the immune system to activate and get ready
for a proper fight. You can imagine these cells as a sort of traveling
smoke detector: A pathogenic virus like influenza A might be able to
suppress the natural chemical warfare response of its victims and stay
under the radar. But Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells are able to detect
even subtle signs of their presence and amplify them considerably to
sound the alarm.</p>
<p>Indeed they are so sensitive to the signs of a virus infection, that
only a few hours after the first of your civilian cells have been
infected, they have opened the interferon floodgates. This is so fast
that a spike of interferons in your blood is usually the earliest sign
of a virus infection, long before any real symptom or the virus itself
is detectable. In our break room story, this has happened a few hours
after the cough that infected you. On your giant human level, you have
not noticed or thought about any of this, much less felt any symptom
yet.</p>
<p>But while this is great and the onslaught of interferons begins to
awaken the rest of the immune system, influenza A continues to spread
rapidly throughout your respiratory system. Hundreds of thousands of
viruses emerge, leaving first thousands, then millions, of dead and
infected epithelial cells in their wake. At this point, the stealth
approach is no longer necessary, the virus has already succeeded in
buying enough time to replicate prodigiously. To invoke our Troy story
one last time—the invading forces are spilling into the open in
daylight. Soldiers, guards, and civilians are fighting in the streets.
Your immune system has to fare better than the citizens of Troy, though,
or the virus will quickly overwhelm your body.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the weekend has begun and you peel out of bed, ready to
play videogames and do other very important things. But you notice that
something is off: Your throat hurts and your nose is runny, you have a
bit of a headache and a cough. Usually you feel hungry right away after
waking up but today you don’t feel like breakfast at all.*2</p>
<p>You have a cold, you self-diagnose with unwarranted confidence.</p>
<p>“Just in time for the weekend, life is so incredibly unfair! Nobody
has ever had it as hard as me and nobody ever will have it as hard in
the future,” you lament to yourself, expecting sympathy from the
universe but receiving none. You rally. This is but a scratch! You will
just pop a few aspirin and enjoy your free time, a cold will not stop
you. You are right of course—a cold will not stop you. But this is not a
cold.</p>
<p>While you are gravely mistaken about the nature of what is going on
inside your body, the influenza A virus is rapidly gaining ground,
spreading throughout your lungs. It now has become a proper infection
that is dangerous and that is still not contained. Your immune system is
already in full response mode, as you will soon notice. We alluded to
the fact a few times already, your immune system is often the part that
causes the largest amount of damage in an infection and influenza is no
different. All the unpleasant things you are about to experience are the
result of the desperate attempts to halt the brutal invasion of your
lungs.</p>
<p>The battlefield, which now stretches from your upper to your lower
respiratory tract, has become busy. Local macrophages clean up dead
epithelial cells and swallow free-floating viruses if they stumble over
them, while they release cytokines to call backup and cause more
inflammation.</p>
<p>Neutrophils join the fight too, although their presence is a mixed
bag (and there is still active research and debate among immunologists
if they are actually helpful in case of virus infections or are doing
unnecessary damage). Neutrophils seem to not really be able to fight
viruses well, so their help is mostly passive: Being the unhinged
warriors they are, they increase the level of inflammation.</p>
<p>Here the general role of the Innate Immune System to provide context
and make overarching decisions becomes apparent again: Your soldier
cells realize that they are dealing with a virus infection and that they
need help on a larger scale, so they release another set of cytokines:
Pyrogens.</p>
<p>Pyrogen loosely translated means “the creator of heat,” an extremely
fitting name in this case. Simply put, pyrogens are chemicals that cause
fever. Fever is a systemic, body wide response that creates an
environment that is unpleasant for pathogens and enables your immune
cells to fight harder. It also is a strong motivator to lie down and
rest, to save energy, and to give your own body and immune system the
time they need to heal or to fight the infection.*3</p>
<p>Pyrogens work in quite a cool way, in the sense that they directly
affect your brain and make it do things. You probably have heard about
the blood-brain barrier, an ingenious contraption that stops most cells
and substances (and pathogens of course) from entering the very delicate
tissues of your brain, to keep it safe from damage and disturbance. But
there are regions of your brain where this barrier is partially
penetrable by pyrogens. If they enter and interact with your brain they
trigger a complex chain of events that basically cranks up the
temperature by changing the internal thermostat of your body.</p>
<p>Your brain cranks up the heat in two main ways: For one, it may
generate more heat by inducing shivering, which is just your muscles
contracting really quickly, which generates heat as a byproduct. And by
making it harder for this heat to escape by contracting the blood
vessels close to the surface of your body, which reduces the heat that
can escape through your skin. This is also the reason why you can feel
so cold when you have a fever—your skin is actually colder because your
body is trying to really heat up your core and create unpleasant
temperatures at the battlefield to make pathogens really unhappy.</p>
<p>Still, fever is a serious investment for your body as it costs a lot
of energy to heat up the whole system by a few degrees, depending on how
harsh your fever is. On average your metabolic rate increases by about
10% for every two degrees Fahrenheit your body temperature rises, which
means that you burn more calories just to stay alive. While this might
actually not sound all that bad to you if you want to lose a bit of
weight, in the wild burning extra calories is not a great idea most of
the time, it is an investment that an organism has to hope will pay off
in the end. And it seems to pay off most of the time!</p>
<p>Most of the pathogens that like humans operate really well at our
regular body temperature and the higher temperatures during fever make
their lives much harder. Just imagine the difference between going for a
run on a fresh spring morning in contrast to going for a run in the
summer heat at noon without any shade. It is just that much more
draining to do anything if you are too hot. So the increased body heat
actually directly slows down the reproduction of viruses and bacteria
and makes them more susceptible to your immune defenses.*4</p>
<p>While not all mechanisms and effects on the immune system are known,
generally the Innate and Adaptive Immune System work better through
higher temperatures from fever in a variety of ways. Neutrophils are
recruited faster, Macrophages and Dendritic Cells get a bit better at
devouring enemies, Killer Cells kill better, antigen-presenting cells
get better at presenting, T Cells have an easier time navigating the
blood and lymph system. Just overall fever seems to activate the immune
system to improve the ability to fight pathogens.</p>
<p>How exactly does the actual temperature increase stress out pathogens
and make our cells better at fighting them? Well, it all has to do with
the proteins inside cells and how they work. To put it in a simplified
way: Certain chemical reactions between proteins have a sort of optimal
zone, a temperature range in which they are most efficient. By
increasing the temperature in the body during fever, pathogens are
forced to operate outside this optimal zone. Why does this not affect
your cells but even helps them? Well, as we alluded to earlier, your
animal cells are larger and more complex than for example bacteria
cells. Your cells have more sophisticated mechanisms that protect them
from higher temperatures, such as heat shock proteins. Also, your cells
have more redundancies, if one of their internal mechanisms is impaired,
they probably have alternative mechanisms that can take over. This is
also the reason fever is helpful to your immune cells, since they can
handle the heat, they can make use of the effect that higher
temperatures tend to speed up certain reactions between proteins. So the
complexity of your cells, in contrast to many microorganisms, makes them
not suffer from fever but instead work more efficiently. Of course there
is also a limit on how hot we can get and for how long before our
systems break down too.*5</p>
<p>Back at the escalating battlefield, Dendritic Cells swallow and scan
fluids and detritus and are picking up influenza viruses. They also do
get infected by them but are way more resilient than epithelial cells
and keep operating, which will become important later on. Their role is
super important because without the Adaptive Immune System your body has
a really hard time with virus infections, especially such effective
pathogens as influenza. Until it shows up though, the efforts are only
delaying the infection, not stopping it, and so the virus spreads and
infects more and more cells.</p>
