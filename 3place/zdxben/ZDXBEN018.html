<h4 id="the-swamp-kingdom-of-the-mucosa">24 The Swamp Kingdom of the
Mucosa</h4>
<p>Whatever you do in life, it is not possible to exist and function
without the world and the things it offers. There is no pillow fort, no
remote cabin in the woods, no teenager and their computer, no worldwide
social distancing intense enough to protect you from the fact that you
need to interact with the world. At the very least, you need a constant
influx of food and so a minimal amount of interaction with the outside
is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Your body faces the same problem because your cells need oxygen and
nutrients to keep themselves going and discard dangerous waste that is a
byproduct of the cellular metabolism. In other words, resources need to
get from the outside to the inside while garbage needs to get from the
inside to the outside. So your body can’t be a closed system—it is
unavoidable to have places where your insides directly interact with the
outsides.</p>
<p>But these places are dangerous weak points that allow uninvited
guests to sneak into the continent of flesh. And indeed, the vast
majority of pathogens that make you sick enter where the interactions
with the outside happen. In the long tube that begins in your mouth and
ends in your butt, or in the many side tunnels that lead into the cave
systems that make some sort of exchange possible.</p>
<p>As we mentioned at the beginning, your lungs, your guts, mouth, and
respiratory and reproductive tracts are really just outsides wrapped up
in the insides. These insides are lined with what you could call your
“inside skin.” Unfortunately the correct name is Mucosa. But to make it
a bit more badass we will call it the Swamp Kingdom of the Mucosa.</p>
<p>The swamp kingdom needs to solve the immense problem of being easy to
cross for nutrients and substances the body wants to get rid of, while
being hard to cross for pathogens at the same time. This means that in
and around the swamp kingdom the immune system has to be different than
in the rest of the body.</p>
<p>While most of your continent of flesh is pretty sterile and devoid of
microorganisms, devoid of other, your swamp kingdom is constantly in
contact with all sorts of other—pieces of foodstuffs that need to be
taken in, indigestible stuff that just passes through, friendly bacteria
that get a free pass and are allowed to stay in your gut, all sort of
particles that flow through the air and are breathed in, from pollution
to dust.</p>
<p>And of course with all that come countless unwanted visitors that try
to sneak in and pass the defenses. Some innocent travelers that just got
lost, some of them dangerous pathogens that have specialized in hunting
humans. This makes the job of the immune system around these places
extra hard and the balancing act it has to perform even harder. Because
in the Swamp Kingdom of the Mucosa, your immune system has to be
somewhat tolerant.</p>
<p>In contrast, in most parts of your body, your immune system is not
tolerant at all. Like when you cut yourself and bacteria invade your
soft tissue, the immune system reacts with maximum violence and anger. A
bacterium below your skin or flesh is unacceptable and needs to be
killed immediately no matter the costs. Around your mucosa this is not
possible. Just imagine your immune system attacking every little
unwanted bacterium sitting on a piece of food with as much anger as the
bacteria in our rusty nail scenario.</p>
<p>Imagine it reacting violently to every little flake of dust that you
breathed in. No, the immune system of the swamp kingdom can’t be as
aggressive as the immune system in other parts of the body or it would
simply destroy the places made for the exchange of gases and resources,
which can make your life miserable or even kill you (as it indeed does
for many people who suffer from autoimmune diseases or allergies, but
more on that later). In the mucosa the Immune System had to learn to
tread more lightly and to act as locally as possible when provoked. Yet
at the same time, the mucosa is the most vulnerable area of the whole
body, so the immune system also can’t be incompetent or super chill
here. A truly hard nut to crack.</p>
<p>So the first countermeasure to prevent invasion is to be a horrible
and deadly place for unwanted microorganisms. So the mucosa employs a
number of different defense systems.</p>
<p>If the skin is like a vast desert and a nearly impassable wall
protecting the border of the continent of flesh, the mucosa is like a
vast swampland, with deadly traps and groups of defenders patrolling.
Easier to pass than the desert and border wall of the skin, but still
not easy to pass. OK. So what is the mucosa and how does it defend
you?</p>
<p>The first line of defense employed by the swamp kingdom is the swamp
itself. The mucus layer. Mucus is a slippery and viscous substance that
behaves a little bit like watery gel. You know it as the slimy stuff in
your nose that becomes especially visible and disgusting when you have a
cold—but it is actually all over your insides—in your gut, your lungs,
your respiratory system, your mouth, the inside of your eyelids.</p>
<p>It covers all of your surfaces that interact with the outside that
are wrapped inside you. Mucus is continuously produced by Goblet Cells,
which are not important for the story of the immune system but they look
really funny. Imagine them as weird squished worms that have to vomit
all the time to create the mucus layer.</p>
<p>This slimy mucus serves multiple purposes—in the simplest sense it is
just a physical barrier so intruders have a harder time reaching the
cells that it covers. Imagine swimming in a pool filled up with slime.
And then imagine trying to dive to the bottom, only the pool is 300 feet
deep (please excuse this mental image). And mucus is not just a sticky
barrier but also filled with unpleasant surprises similar to the desert
kingdom: salts, weaponized enzymes that can dissolve the outsides of
microbes, and special substances that sort of sponge up crucial
nutrients that bacteria need to survive, so they starve to death inside
the mucus.</p>
<p>In most places your mucus is also saturated with deadly IgA
Antibodies. So just by itself, the slimy part of the swamp is not a very
welcoming place. But it does not just protect you from outside
intruders, it also protects your body from itself. For example, have you
ever asked yourself how it is possible that you have a sack filled with
literal acid inside of you? Well, the mucosa inside your stomach acts as
a barrier that keeps the acid at a distance and protects the cells
making up your stomach wall.</p>
<p>But the mucus is not just slime sitting there—it also moves. A vast
network of fine cilia, tiny organelles that look a bit like hair, cover
the membranes of the special cells that make up the first layer of the
mucous membrane: Epithelial Cells. These cells are the equivalent of
your skin cells, if you want. They are the cells that directly sit on
the border of your mucous membranes, only covered by the slime. They are
your “inside skin” cells.</p>
<p>In some places there is only a single layer, one cell thick, between
the slime and the inside of your body. Epithelial Cells don’t have the
luxury that the skin has, where hundreds of cells are layered on top of
each other. So Epithelial Cells are no pushovers. Although they are not
technically cells of the immune system, they play a crucial role in your
defense as they are especially great at activating your immune system
and at calling for help with special cytokines. You can imagine them a
bit like a citizen militia, no match for an enemy army but a very
helpful addition to your defenses in case of an invasion.</p>
<p>And one of their jobs is to move the slime with the hairlike cilia
that cover their membranes. Some microorganisms use cilia to move
themselves around, while your epithelial cells use them to move the
slime that covers them by sort of “beating” in unison. The direction
depends on their location. In your respiratory tract, your nose, and
lungs, the slime is moved either directly out of the body through your
mouth or nose or via a slight detour it is swallowed and ends up in your
stomach.</p>
<p>We swallow a fair amount of this slime in our lives and as disgusting
as this may be, it is a pretty good system. After all, your stomach is
an ocean of acid that the vast majority of pathogens are unable to
survive. In your gut the direction should also be clear—things come from
the stomach and move to your anus, where all things that enter your
mouth must leave eventually.</p>
<p>But the Swamp Kingdom of your Mucosa is not really a single
kingdom—it is much more like an alliance of different kingdoms that are
all very different from each other but working together with a common
goal. Which makes sense. The Desert Kingdom of the Skin may vary in
thickness between the bottom of your foot and your lower back, but its
job is more or less the same. In contrast, the mucosa in your lungs has
a very different job from the mucosa in your gut, which has a completely
different job from the mucosa in the female reproductive tract. And
according to the different specializations of the realm, the immune
system that protects it works differently. Before we move on to our next
great enemy, the virus, let us take a look at the weird kingdom that is
your gut and how it deals with the literal trillions of bacteria living
there.</p>
