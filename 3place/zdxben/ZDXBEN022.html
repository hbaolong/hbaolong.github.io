Aside The Difference Between the Flu and the Common Cold</h4>
<p>The flu generally falls into the category of acute upper respiratory
tract viral infections, which are the most common types of disease
humanity has to deal with. What makes them really annoying to talk about
is not only their super-handy name, but that it can mean a lot of
different things on a wide spectrum. On the one end we have the common
cold, a disease that even a healthy adult gets two to five times a year,
and children up to seven times, and that is, everything considered,
pretty harmless.*6</p>
<p>The common cold can be so mild you don’t even notice it, or it can be
pretty unpleasant. The symptoms vary from none at all to a headache,
sneezing, chilliness, a sore throat, an obstructed nose, coughing, and a
general malaise.</p>
<p>In the case of the flu, fever and other symptoms usually hit you like
a freight train. You feel fine, maybe a tiny bit under the weather, and
then boom, suddenly you feel actually really sick and weak as you burn
up. A proper influenza A infection comes with a whole trove of nasty
symptoms. Aside from a high fever, you feel extremely tired and weak,
your head hurts, which makes thinking or reading hard, your throat is
sore and you have to cough intensely. As if this would not be enough, as
the day moves on your whole body begins to ache and hurt. The pain
seemingly comes right from your muscles in your arms and legs. Most of
these symptoms can be caused by other infections, they are not
technically unique to the flu, which can make it hard to discern, even
for doctors sometimes.</p>
<p>There is the common wisdom that the color of your snot can tell what
kind of infection you have and if it is just a cold or a flu, but that
is not true: the color just tells you how severe the inflammatory
reaction inside your nose is, not what caused it. The more colorful, the
more Neutrophils have given their life.</p>
<p>Think about this for a moment—with every sneeze, you get rid of not
only thousands to millions of viruses or bacteria, but also your own
cells that fought bravely and died in the process. There even might be
Neutrophils still alive when you blow your nose into a tissue. A sort of
sad fate, like an astronaut ejected into space. Fighting for you with
all their might, only to get discarded with the enemy, ending up in a
trash can. A truly horrifying fate, and if your cells were conscious
this would be a pretty sad way to end their lives.</p>
<p>After you have spent your Saturday morning being a whiny baby and
being stubborn about enjoying your weekend, the influenza A infection
finally hits you for real. You begin to feel worse and worse, you get
hot and weak, and all your symptoms scale up. It is no longer possible
to ignore this, you are properly sick. You crawl back into bed and have
no other choice than to go through this now, there is nothing you can do
against the flu but to rely on your immune system working properly.
Well, at least this also means you can skip work for a week or two, you
think before you slide into a fevery drowse.</p>
<p>Within three days after the initial infection with influenza A, the
replication of the virus infection peaks as the innate immune system is
catching and killing as many viruses as possible. Still, the majority of
the viruses are safely hidden inside infected cells, doing their dirty
parasitic work in the dark behind membranes. If the fight continues this
way, the virus will not be removed, there is no way around it. Since
viruses spend most of their time inside infected cells, it is simply too
hard to catch all of them when they float from cell to cell. If your
immune system could fight viruses only when they were outside cells,
they would be nearly unbeatable and humans might not be around
today.</p>
<p>The best way to kill a lot of viruses is to destroy infected cells,
and the viruses inside them. Let us pause for a moment to appreciate the
magnitude of what we are talking about here. Your immune system needs to
be able to kill your own cells. Your immune system has an actual license
to kill you. As you can imagine, this is an extraordinarily dangerous
power that carries an extreme responsibility; just imagine what would
happen if these cells go wrong, they could decide to kill healthy tissue
and organs. And indeed, this does happen to millions of people each day
and is called autoimmune disease, which we will get to know much more
intimately later on. So, how does your immune system do this without
causing horrible damage?</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells have one of these horrible names in
immunology that are not helpful at all. A thing about the immune system
is that there are a lot of different subclasses of cells. So there are a
bunch of different Dendritic Cells, a bunch of different macrophages,
etc. The thing is: This doesn’t really matter. It would be much better
if the Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell would be called: “Chemical Warfare
Cell.” Or “Antivirus Alarm Cell.” Or anything other than what it is
actually called, because all of these names would describe it better. We
will handle this by never mentioning this cell again after we explain it
here because on the one hand, it is too cool not to mention that you
have this special antiviral chemical warfare cell but on the other, it
is confusing that there are special “Dendritic Cells” with completely
different jobs than the regular Dendritic Cells we got to learn so much
about. So once we are done talking about it here, we can all just die
happily without learning any more details about it.</p>
<p>*2 Why do you lose your appetite when you are sick? Well, you can
blame the onslaught of cytokines that your immune system releases for
that. The cytokines signal your brain that a serious defense is
happening at that very moment that the body needs to conserve energy
for. Because as you may imagine, mobilizing millions or billions of
cells for a fight is a pretty resource-heavy operation. Digesting food
actually requires a lot of energy too, so shutting these processes down
is freeing up your system to focus on the defense. It also reduces the
availability of certain nutrients in your blood that your invaders would
love to get their tiny pathogenic hands on. This does not mean that you
should actively try to starve out a disease. Not digesting is a
short-term strategy not a long term solution and in chronically ill
people, the lack of appetite can lead to dangerous weight loss. So if
you feel hungry again you can eat something to refill your energy
storage.</p>
<p>*3 A lot of different substances can be pyrogens, from certain
interferons, to special molecules released by activated macrophages to
the cell walls of bacteria. But in the end, you just need to remember
one thing: Your innate immune cells release substances called pyrogens
that order your brain to make your body hotter!</p>
<p>*4 OK, let us talk about one of the weirdest Nobel Prizes for
medicine and how upsetting the past was and how great the present is.
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by spirochetes
bacteria. Its possible symptoms are horrible and creepy and if you want
to have a bad time you should go look up some pictures online. One of
the possible late stages of the disease is neurosyphilis, an infection
of the central nervous system. Patients affected by it basically would
usually suffer from meningitis and progressive brain damage. What made
the experience even more unpleasant were mental problems, from dementia
to schizophrenia, depression, mania, or delirium, all caused by the
bacteria wreaking havoc. Ultimately it is fair to say that affected
patients had a bad time and in the end they would die without doctors
being able to help them, other than to try to alleviate their suffering.
But they did observe that in some cases patients that suffered from
unrelated, very high fevers would actually end up being healed. So
naturally, a few doctors began experimenting with pyrotherapy, a version
of treatment by causing fever, and began injecting syphilis patients
with malaria. This sounds horrible at first but it was a pretty
acceptable risk—the patients would die anyway and malaria could already
be treated at the time. Malaria was a prime candidate because it caused
high fevers over a long and sustained time and basically cooked out the
syphilis bacteria that just could not stand the heat. Indeed the
treatment was so effective that it was honored with the Nobel Prize in
Medicine in 1927. The onset of antibiotics made the treatment obsolete
in the 1940s, making this story one of the great footnotes in medical
history.</p>
<p>*5 This seems to be true for most animals. For example, lizards that
were held in terrariums with higher temperatures had a higher chance of
surviving an infection than lizards that were held in colder
environments. And there have been a number of similar experiments with
fish, mice, or rabbits and even some plant species. Transforming our
bodies into a hot ecosystem just seems to be a good defense strategy
against the intruders of the microworld. Interestingly, animals who
can’t regulate their body temperature like us mammals can, so-called
“ectothermic,” or “cold-blooded,” animals like lizards or turtles have
behavioral fever. Which means that if their immune cells release certain
cytokines, they look for a hot place, like a rock that has been in the
hot sun for a long time, and rest there for a while. They basically
grill themselves to increase their body temperature to a point where the
pathogens inside them have a really bad time.</p>
<p>*6 You know the people who use moments like this to sharply inhale
before they let you know they never get sick even though you didn’t ask
them? Or that they haven’t been sick in years because _ (enter reason
that makes no sense) _ ? Rest assured: Everybody gets sick, common cold
infections can just be pretty mild or we selectively remember the times
when we feel fine. The best way to react to this kind of outburst is to
nod politely and change the subject.</p>
