<h4 id="the-murder-university-of-the-thymus">18 The Murder University of
the Thymus</h4>
<p>Going to school or college can be quite unpleasant and annoying.
There are schedules, tests, and pressure to perform, other people, and
getting up early. And all this while you are transforming from a
teenager, the worst stage in the human life cycle, into, ideally, a
functional human being.</p>
<p>But human school is harmless, laughable even, compared to the
university your Adaptive Immune Cells have to graduate from: the Murder
University of the Thymus. Your Thymus is absolutely crucial for your
survival and, in a way, will decide at what age you will die, so you
might think that it would be as well-known as the liver, lungs, or
heart. But weirdly enough, most people are not even aware that they have
this organ. Maybe because it is pretty ugly.</p>
<p>The Thymus is an unappealing and boring collection of tissue that
looks a little bit like two old, lumpy chicken breasts sewn together in
the middle. Despite its ugliness, it is one of your most important
immune cell universities (others include your bone marrow for your B
Cells, for example, but we’ll ignore them here as they get their own
chapter later). Some of your most powerful, crucial adaptive immune
cells are educated and trained here: T Cells.1</p>
<p>We met one group of T Cells on the battlefield briefly, when they
came rushing in to swing the battle, although we haven’t even begun to
discover all their qualities. T Cells do a variety of things, from
orchestrating other immune cells, to being antivirus superweapons, to
killing cancer cells. We will talk about this amazing cell and all the
mind-blowing things it does in more detail later, for now just remember:
Without T Cells you are quite dead—they may be the most important
Adaptive Immune Cell you have. But before they can fight for you, they
need to pass the horribly dangerous curriculum in the Thymus. Failing a
test here doesn’t mean bad grades. Failing here means death.</p>
<p>Only the best of the best students avoid this fate. As we discussed
in the last chapter: The adaptive immune system is mixing gene segments
to produce an amazing variety of different receptors, able to connect to
every possible protein, in this context called an antigen, in the
universe. This means that each individual T Cell is born with ONE
specific type of receptor, able to recognize ONE specific antigen. But
there is a vital flaw: With so many different receptors there are
guaranteed to be a large number of T Cells with receptors that are able
to connect to proteins from your own cells. This is not a theoretical
danger, but the cause of a number of very real and serious diseases that
millions of people are suffering from right now called autoimmune
diseases.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say a T Cell receptor can connect to a protein on
the surface of a skin cell, it would not understand that it is
connecting to a friend. It would just try to kill it. Or worse, since
there are quite a lot of skin cells in the human body, it would think a
large attack was going on with enemies everywhere, and alert the rest of
the immune system to go into attack mode, and cause inflammation and all
sorts of chaos. While this is bad enough, it could also affect heart
cells or nerve cells, leading to even more dangerous conditions.</p>
<p>At least 7% of all Americans suffer from autoimmune diseases but we
will learn more about them later. In a nutshell, an autoimmune disease
is your adaptive immune system thinking that your own cells are enemies,
that they are other. It is no hyperbole to say that this is a critical
danger to your survival.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the body takes this issue extremely seriously and
came up with the Murder University of the Thymus to address it. After a
fresh and young T Cell has been born it travels to the university and
begins its training, which consists of three steps, or better, three
tests:</p>
<p>The first test is basically just making sure the T Cells have the
ability to make working T Cell receptors. If this were a regular school,
this would be the teachers checking if the students have all their
notebooks and required reading material with them—only they would not
send the students home if they forgot something, but rather, shoot them
in the face.2</p>
<p>The T Cells that pass test one have functional receptors. Great job
so far! The second test is called positive selection: Here the teacher
cells check if the T Cells are really good at recognizing the receptors
of the cells they will need to work with. Imagine this part as if the
teacher is checking if the pens the students brought are all full of ink
and that the workbooks are in fine condition. Once again, death is the
punishment for failing the second test.</p>
<p>After the two first hurdles have been taken the last and most
important test waits for our T Cell students: Negative selection. And
this might be the hardest test of all. The final exam is simply: Can the
T Cell recognize self? Can its receptor connect to the main proteins
inside the body? The proteins that make you, you? The only acceptable
answer is “No, not at all.”</p>
<p>So in the final exam the T Cells are presented with all sorts of
protein combinations that are used by the cells of your body. The way
this happens is pretty fascinating by the way—the teacher cells in the
Thymus that do the testing have a special license to make all sorts of
special proteins that usually are made only in organs like the heart,
pancreas, or the liver and also hormones, like insulin for example. This
way they can show the T Cell all kinds of proteins that are marked as
“self.” If a T Cell is able to recognize any of these self-proteins,
they are taken out back and shot in the head immediately.3</p>
<p>All in all, 98 of 100 students that enter the university will not
survive the training and are killed before they graduate. Roughly ten to
twenty million T cells will leave your Thymus today. They represent the
successful 2% of survivors. These survivors are so diverse that you end
up with at least one T Cell that can recognize basically every possible
enemy that the universe could throw at you.4</p>
<p>Unfortunately your Murder University is already in the process of
shutting down. Your Thymus basically begins shrinking and withering away
when you are a small child. A process that is sped up once you reach
puberty. Every year you are alive more and more Thymus cells turn into
fat cells or just worthless tissue. The university closes more and more
departments and gets worse as you age, until around the ripe age of
eighty-five, your T Cell university closes its gates for good. Which is
sort of horrible if you like the concept of being alive and healthy.
There are other places in the body where T Cells can be educated, but
for the most part from this point forward your immune system is more
limited than before. Because once your Thymus is gone, you have to get
by with the T Cells you have trained up to this point. The absence of
the immune cell university is one of the most important reasons why
seniors are much weaker and more susceptible to infectious diseases and
cancer than younger people. Why is that so? Well, the problem is nature
does not care about us once we are no longer making babies, so there is
just no real evolutionary pressure to keep us around in older age.5</p>
<p>OK. So in the last two chapters we learned that our adaptive immune
system has the largest library in the universe. We learned that after
they are born, your T Cells rearrange a few select gene fragments to
create billions of different receptors (each T Cell carries only one
receptor type). And that in total these many different T Cells, each
with its own unique receptor, are able to recognize every possible
antigen in the universe. To make sure your own adaptive immune cells do
not accidentally recognize and attack your own body, these T Cells have
to undergo a rigorous training that only a tiny minority survives. But
in the end you get a few immune cells for every possible enemy that
could ever infect you.</p>
<p>OK, all of this sounds great. But, as with everything in life, there
are, of course, a few more tiny problems.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>1 Actually T Cells got their name from the Thymus, because they go to
school here! It’s a weird naming convention if you think about it.
Imagine you would be called “NW Human” and your sister “B Human” because
you went to Northwestern University and your sister went to Brown
University.</p>
<p>2 OK, technically no T Cell is killed in the Thymus. To be more
correct would actually be that they are told to kill themselves by the
teacher cells. So they are ordered to commit suicide. But hey,
semantics.</p>
<p>3 There is one small exception that could save some of the worst
students, that we will get to know later, but in a nutshell, a T Cell
that is somewhat good at recognizing “self” can be turned into a special
cell called a Regulatory T Cell that has the purpose of calming the
immune system down and prevent autoimmunity. But more on this cell
later.</p>
<p>4 Are you wondering what is happening to all the students that die?
There are a lot of Macrophages in your Thymus and their job is to eat
all the unlucky fellows who did not pass the test.</p>
<p>5 Some of the more promising efforts of the life-extension community
are in finding ways to delay the shrinkage or even regrow Thymus tissue.
As of the writing of this book one successful study has been conducted
with volunteers that claims to have successfully regenerated Thymus
tissue—although it had only a very small sample size and its results
have yet to be repeated and confirmed by more studies and with more
participants. But if you are reasonably young while reading this, there
might be a chance that by the age you retire there will be drugs or
treatments to regenerate your Thymus!</p>
<p>19 Presenting Information on a Gold Platter: Antigen Presentation</p>
<p>As we witnessed in the simple toe infection, having only a few immune
cells is not very useful in a full-on invasion. You need hundreds of
thousands, if not millions of immune cells to fight a strong enemy
effectively. And while your adaptive immune system has billions of
different cells, each with a receptor for every possible enemy, it only
has maybe ten to a dozen cells with each unique receptor.</p>
<p>Which makes sense if you think about it. If you had millions of cells
for every single one of the hundreds of millions of possible different
pathogens, you would consist of quadrillions of immune cells and nothing
else. On the one hand you would probably never get sick because you were
so well prepared. But then again you would just be a puddle of slime.
Surviving alone is boring, so nature found a much better and extremely
elegant way to solve this conundrum.</p>
<p>When an infection occurs, your immune system determines which
specific defense is needed and how much of it. The adaptive immune
system works together with the Innate Immune System to find the few
cells that have the right receptors for this specific invasion, locate
them among billions of others in your huge body, and then rapidly
produce more of these cells.</p>
<p>Not only does this method enable you to get by with just a few cells
for each possible enemy, it also makes sure that the immune system does
not overproduce weapons and waste resources—which is good because the
immune system is already a pretty energy-intensive system as is. How
does it do this? By preparing a presentation.</p>
<p>Your Adaptive Immune System doesn’t make any real decisions about who
to fight and when it is time to activate—this is the Innate Immune
System’s job, and this is where the Dendritic Cell, this big,
weird-looking cell with many octopus-like arms that takes samples, comes
into play. When an infection happens it covers itself with a selection
of the enemy’s antigens and tries to find a Helper T Cell that is able
to recognize one of the antigens with its specific receptors. And this
is exactly the reason why the Dendritic Cell is so crucially important.
Without Dendritic Cells, there would be no second line of defense. The
toe infection battle scene would have had no late-stage turnaround.</p>
<p>For the first few hours of an infection, the Dendritic Cell samples
the battlefield and collects information about the enemy, which is a
nice way of saying that it swallows enemies and disassembles them into
their parts, or antigens. The Dendritic Cell is an antigen-presenting
cell, which is a complicated way of saying: “covering yourself in your
enemies’ guts.” Dendritic Cells literally disassemble pathogens into
antigen-sized pieces and pack them into special contraptions on their
membranes. On the human scale this would mean killing an enemy soldier
and then covering yourself with bits and pieces of their muscles,
organs, and bones so others could examine them. Extremely brutal, but
for our cells, pretty efficient and a normal weekday.</p>
<p>Covered in guts, the Dendritic Cell then travels through the
lymphatic system to present them to the Adaptive Immune System, or more
precisely, to Helper T Cells.</p>
<p>All antigen-presenting cells have one thing in common: A very special
molecule that is as important as the Toll-Like Receptors and thus
deserves to be talked about, even though it has one of those worst names
in immunology: Major Histocompatibility Complex class II. Or in short,
MHC class II, which is a bit better but not much.</p>
<p>You can imagine the MHC class II receptor as a hot dog bun that can
be filled with a tasty wiener. The wiener in this metaphor is the
antigen. The MHC hot dog bun molecule is so important because it
represents another security mechanism. Another layer of control.</p>
<p>As we mentioned briefly before and will talk about in detail in the
next few chapters, the cells of the Adaptive Immune System are extremely
powerful. Activating them by accident has to be avoided at all costs—so
a few special requirements have to be met before they are activated. And
one of them is the MHC class II receptor, the hot dog bun.</p>
<p>Helper T Cells are able to recognize an antigen only if it is
presented in an MHC class II molecule. Or in other words, they eat a
wiener only in a hot dog bun. Think of Helper T Cells as really picky
eaters—they would NEVER even think to touch and eat a wiener that floats
around by itself. No sir, that would be disgusting! Helper T Cells only
ever consider eating a wiener if it is nicely presented to them in a hot
dog bun.</p>
<p>This makes sure that Helper T Cells can’t just get activated by
accident because they pick up antigens that float around freely in the
blood or lymph. They need to be presented with an antigen that sits in
an MHC class II molecule, from an antigen-presenting cell. Only this way
does the Helper T Cell have confirmation that there is actual danger and
that it should get active!</p>
<p>OK, this is pretty weird stuff and it is OK if it still feels
counterintuitive to you. Let’s do this again but this time follow a
Dendritic Cell from our story with the rusty nail to see how this
process works.</p>
<p>So back at our battlefield where soldiers are engaged in an epic
battle, Dendritic Cells swallow a cross section of everything floating
around, including enemies. If they grab a bacterium they rip it into
small pieces, antigens (the wieners), and put them into MHC class II
molecules (the hot dog buns) that cover its outsides. The cell is now
covered in tiny parts of dead enemies and detritus from the site of
infection.</p>
<p>Then the Dendritic Cell makes its way through the lymphatic system to
the closest lymph node to look for a Helper T Cell. Remember how in the
Lymph Node megacities there are those special dating areas? Places for
Dendritic Cells from battlefields and Helper T Cells that travel around
the body to meet and find love? Well, let’s drop in on such a date.</p>
<p>Our Dendritic Cell, covered in antigens (wieners) that sit in MHC
class II molecules (hot dog buns), goes from T Cell to T Cell and rubs
its antigen-covered body against them, to see if this yields any
reaction. When a Helper T Cell happens to have the right T Cell
receptor, with just the right shape that recognizes the antigen in the
MHC class II molecule, it will connect to it. Just like two puzzle
pieces snapping perfectly together with a loud click.</p>
<p>This is a pretty exciting moment. The Dendritic Cell actually has
found the right Helper T Cell out of billions! But this is still not
enough to activate the Helper T Cell. A second signal is necessary,
communicated by another set of receptors on both cells.</p>
<p>This second signal is like a gentle kiss from the Dendritic Cell, if
you want. It’s another confirmation signal that clearly communicates
again: “This is real, you are really properly activated!” Why is that so
important that we mention it here? This is another security mechanism
that prevents Helper T Cells from activating accidentally—only if a
Dendritic Cell, that is representing the Innate Immune System here, is
activated by real danger is the Adaptive Immune System, represented by
the Helper T Cell, supposed to activate.</p>
<p>Let us summarize one last time because this stuff is really important
and really hard: To activate your Adaptive Immune System, a Dendritic
Cell needs to kill enemies and rip them into pieces called antigens,
which you can imagine as wieners. These antigens are put into special
molecules, called MHC class II molecules, that you can imagine like hot
dog buns.</p>
<p>On the other end, Helper T Cells rearrange gene segments to create a
single specific receptor that is able to connect to one specific antigen
(a specific wiener). The Dendritic Cell is looking for just the right
Helper T Cell that can bind its specific receptor to the antigen.</p>
<p>And if a matching T Cell is found the two cells interlock. But then
there needs to be a second signal, like a gentle encouraging kiss on the
cheek, that tells the T Cell that all is good and the signal from the
presented antigen is real. And only then does a Helper T Cell
activate.</p>
<p>OK, phew, wow. Overcomplicated much?</p>
<p>Is this incredibly complicated dance really necessary? Why all these
extra steps? Well, to reiterate again: Your Adaptive Immune System is so
resource intensive and powerful and, frankly, dangerous to yourself that
your immune system really wants to absolutely make sure that it does not
get activated by accident.</p>
<p>Of course the immune system doesn’t want anything as it is not
conscious—it’s probably more that animals whose Adaptive Immune System
could get activated more easily did not survive.</p>
<p>There is another very interesting aspect to the activation of the
Adaptive Immune System. In a sense, what is happening here is that
information about an infection is transmitted from your Innate Immune
System to your Adaptive Immune System.</p>
<p>Earlier we called the Dendritic Cell a living information carrier. By
sampling the battlefield and collecting these samples in its receptors,
Dendritic Cells become living snapshots of a battlefield in a moment in
time. Once one leaves, it stops sampling and is locked in.</p>
<p>After arriving in a Lymph Node, the Dendritic Cell has about a week
to find a T Cell to activate before an internal timer runs out and it
kills itself, as so many immune cells do. When it does so, it wipes the
old information of the battlefield from your body. This wiping of
information is another mechanism the Immune System uses to regulate
itself. In a sense, the Dendritic Cell is like a paperboy carrying
newspapers with breaking news to the Adaptive Immune System.</p>
<p>By sending fresh snapshots, or newspapers, every few hours and
eventually deleting them, your immune system collects and delivers a
constant stream of fresh information about the battlefield. By deleting
it regularly it makes sure not to operate on old information. Today’s
newspaper with breaking news might carry useful information, while
yesterday’s is scrap paper, only good to wrap fish.</p>
<p>As the infection dies down no more new Dendritic Cell snapshots are
sent to the Adaptive Immune System, the older sets of information die,
and no new T Cells are activated. This is a crucial principle that we
will encounter over and over: The immune system needs constant
stimulation to stay active and by sending living news from the
battlefield that self-deletes after a while, your immune system can
respond with just the right amount of vigor that is necessary.</p>
<p>Before we move on, here is a really interesting fact: The genes that
are responsible for the MHC molecules are the most diverse genes in the
human gene pool, leading to a huge variety of MHC molecules between
individuals. Of all the things that are different between humans, why
are the MHC molecules so unique to every person?</p>
<p>Well, different types of MHC are better or worse at presenting
antigens from different enemies, like one type might be especially good
at presenting a specific virus antigen while another type could be great
at presenting a bacteria antigen. For humans as a species this is
enormously beneficial because it makes it really hard for a single
pathogen to wipe us out.</p>
<p>For example, when the Black Death ravaged Europe in medieval times,
there were people whose MHC class II molecules were just naturally
really good at presenting the antigens of the bacterium Yersinia pestis,
which caused the plague. They had a higher chance of surviving the
disease and making sure humans as a species survived.</p>
<p>This is so incredibly crucial for our collective survival that
evolution may have made it a contributing factor in mate selection. In
human words: You find potential partners with MHC molecules that are
different from yours more attractive! OK wait, what? How would you even
know this? Well, you can literally smell the difference! The shape of
your MHC molecules does influence a number of special molecules that are
secreted by your body—which we pick up subconsciously, from the body
odor of other people—so you communicate what type of immune system you
have through your individual smell!</p>
<p>In German there is even a popular saying “Jemanden gut riechen
können,” literally translated “being able to smell someone very well,”
which means “liking someone on an intuitive level.” This smell thing is
a real thing! Aside from the intuitive level that might feel correct to
you, there have been an abundance of studies that showed that all sorts
of animals—including humans—prefer the smell of mates with MHC molecules
that are different from their own. We just find that if a potential mate
has a different immune system, he or she smells sexier. This extra
attraction is also a mechanism that avoids inbreeding by making your
biological siblings not smell attractive on a sexual level and decreases
the chances of close family members getting involved with each other.
Which makes sense—by combining genes that create a diverse immune
system, the chances of having healthy offspring rise immensely. So next
time when you hug your partner, know that their immune system is
probably one of the reasons why you find them attractive!</p>
<p>With all this in mind, it’s time to finally watch your immune system
superweapons in action.</p>

<p>Let us use this moment to drive another thing home: Cells are stupid.
Dendritic Cells are stupid. Nobody is making any kind of decision or
conscious analysis here. The things we are describing here are happening
by chance. The magic of your immune system is that it has evolved a
setup that increases the chances of these seemingly impossible events to
a degree that they are an actual, proper protection! We will explore how
this works in more detail in the following chapters.</p>
<p>20 Awakening the Adaptive Immune System: T Cells</p>
<p>The awakening of the Adaptive Immune System usually begins in the
lymph node dating pools, where Dendritic Cells covered in hot dog buns
filled with antigens try to find the right T Cells. T Cells have a much
more varied set of jobs than the Macrophages or Neutrophils we got to
know more intimately earlier. For one, there are multiple classes of T
Cells: Helper T Cells, Killer T Cells, and Regulatory T Cells, each able
to specialize even more into various subclasses, for every possible kind
of infection.</p>
<p>Looking at a T Cell, you would not be very impressed. They are
average size, and don’t seem special in any way. But they are absolutely
indispensable for your survival. People who don’t have enough T Cells,
because of a genetic defect, chemotherapy, or a disease like AIDS, have
a very high chance of dying from infections and cancers. Sadly, even
with the best our modern medicine has to offer, the lives of patients
without T Cells often can’t be saved. Because as we will learn in a
moment, T Cells are the coordinators of the immune system. They
orchestrate others and directly activate your heaviest weapons.</p>
<p>T Cells are travelers that start their lives out in the bone marrow,
where they mix and match the gene fragments that create their unique T
Cell receptors, before they visit the Murder University of the Thymus to
be educated. If the T Cells survive their education they move through
your lymphatic megacity network, looking for an antigen that is exactly
right and to get the encouraging kiss from a Dendritic Cell, to get
activated.</p>
<p>You might still think the fact that this principle actually works is
a bit crazy. After all, what are the odds that a Dendritic Cell carrying
a specific antigen, will find exactly the right T Cell that has the
matching receptor for a specific enemy? What are the odds of picking a
random puzzle piece out of millions and finding the one cell out of
billions that carries the matching puzzle piece that just so happens to
fit perfectly into it?</p>
<p>Well for one, it is not just a single Dendritic Cell, in an infection
at least dozens will make the trip. And on top of that the system is
helped by fast travel. T Cells traverse the whole of your lymphatic
superhighway once per day—imagine what this would mean on your human
scale. You would need to drive from New York to L.A. every single day,
while stopping in hundreds of towns and rest stops on your way to ask
around if someone was looking specifically for you. This is what T Cells
do and so the chances of meeting exactly the right Dendritic Cell with
the matching antigen to their T Cell receptor works out just fine. When
this meeting happens the T Cell activates, and all hell breaks
loose.</p>
<p>For now we will just talk about the Helper T Cell to keep things nice
and simple but we will get to know the classes of T Cells much more
intimately later on. We talked about the Helper T Cell already but now
we are going to get a fuller picture.</p>
<p>Let us think back to our infection. About a day after the Dendritic
Cell has left the battlefield, millions of Neutrophils and Macrophages
are fighting and dying in a dramatic fashion. At this point there might
be just a single activated Helper T Cell in one of your lymph nodes.
This is the state of the Adaptive Immune System and somehow it now needs
to take control over the situation.</p>
<p>The Helper T Cell can’t stay alone if it wants to help beat back the
infection, so its first job is to make more of itself. What we will
pretty casually describe in the next two chapters is called the Clonal
Selection Theory. Its discovery won a Nobel Prize and it is one of the
most crucial principles of how your immune system works. The theory
basically goes like this:</p>
<p>Your activated T Cell leaves the Dendritic Cell that activated it
behind and wanders to a different part of the Lymph Node City where it
begins the process of cloning itself. It divides over and over again,
multiplying as fast as it can. One activated Helper T Cell becomes two,
two become four, four become eight, and so on. Within hours there are
thousands of them. (And because each of the clones has the same unique T
Cell receptor like the first Helper T Cell that got activated, your
immune system now has thousands of cells with this unique receptor that
is an exact fit to the enemy.)</p>
<p>This growth is so rapid that all the new Helper T Cells begin to
crowd out the section of your lymph node megacity.</p>
<p>Once enough clones have been made, the individual cells split into
two groups: Let us follow the first group right now! They need a moment
to orient themselves and take a deep sniff of the cytokines and danger
signals that have been carried by the lymph to the lymph node, and then
they follow the chemical track to the battlefield as quickly as they
can.</p>
<p>Around five days to a week after the wound was inflicted Helper T
Cells arrive at the site of infection, where they begin to act as local
commanders. Although Helper T Cells don’t do any active fighting
themselves, they considerably boost the fighting ability of the local
defense cells, specifically of your heavy hitters. For one, they release
important cytokines that have a diverse set of jobs, from calling for
more reinforcements to increasing inflammation. But Helper T Cells also
contribute more directly to the battle by improving the fighting ability
of your soldiers. We saw what they do earlier: With a whisper to the
black rhino they put them into a wild fighting frenzy, a state of anger
that the Macrophage can achieve only with the help of Helper T
Cells.</p>
<p>Which makes sense if you think about it—Macrophages are powerful and
dangerous monsters and the decision to fully unleash their might should
be the result of careful consideration. If they got into a wild battle
frenzy whenever a few bacteria showed up, they could do serious harm to
the body.</p>
<p>But if Helper T Cells order them to become really properly angry,
that means the infection was so serious that the Adaptive Immune System
awoke and this permits the Innate Immune System to unleash its full
potential. So Helper T Cell commanders at the site of an infection play
the role of amplifiers that use the inherent power of the Innate Immune
System to overcome harsh enemies.</p>
<p>But Helper T Cells do not just put the Macrophages into Killer mode.
Once this battle frenzy is triggered, they are necessary to keep them
alive. Helper T Cells monitor the battlefield, and as long as they sense
danger, they are stimulated and know fighting is still necessary.
Macrophages that fight in battle-frenzy mode are on a timer and will
kill themselves after it runs out. This is another one of these safety
mechanisms to make sure the immune system is limited to a degree. Helper
T Cells can reset this Macrophage suicide timer over and over again. So
as long as danger is present, they tell your exhausted warriors to carry
on by restimulating them over and over again.</p>
<p>Until they decide to stop doing that. Once Helper T Cells notice that
the immune system is clearly winning the fight they stop and so, bit by
bit, more and more spent soldiers end their lives. Helper T Cells do not
just crank up the violence, they also determine when enough is enough
and everybody should calm down.</p>
<p>When the battle is won, the last thing most Helper T Cells do at the
battlefield is to kill themselves, joining most of the soldiers in their
self-destruction to protect the body from themselves. Except, a few
don’t. Some Helper T Cells become Memory Helper T Cells. Whenever you
hear that you are immune to a disease, this is what this means. It means
that you have living memory cells that remember a specific enemy. And
that enemy might come back, so they stick around and become powerful
guardians. Memory Cells are able to recognize a familiar enemy much
quicker than the Innate Immune System ever could. In case of another
infection, this makes the long trip of the Dendritic Cell to the lymph
node unnecessary because these Memory Helper T Cells can immediately
activate and call for heavy reinforcements.</p>
<p>This memory reaction is so fast and so brutally efficient that most
pathogens get only a single chance to infect you. Because your Adaptive
Immune System has adapted and remembers. But Memory Cells get their own
chapter later on so we’ll stop talking about them for now.</p>
<p>The importance of the Helper T Cell does not stop here, not even
close. Remember, we followed only one group from the lymph node to the
battlefield. There was a second group that remained and what they are
about to do might be even more important: Activating some of your most
efficient immune weapons you have at your disposal. The mighty B Cell,
your living weapon factories.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>If you have ever played Dungeons andandandand Dragons you may have
encountered the same principle of classes before. When you make your
character, there are different classes you can choose from, say, a
fighter, a mage, or a cleric. But these classes split again into
subclasses. For example, a fighter can specialize and become a knight,
or a battle master, or a champion (and so on, there are many more). Each
of these subclasses still is a fighter, so it smashes heads in with
melee weapons, but also has different specialties that make them
stronger in different situations. So without the need to create entirely
new classes, these subclasses provide a lot more diversity and options
for you as the player.</p>
<p>And this is exactly how your immune system behaves. Basically, most
immune cells have a number of subclasses with different jobs and
specializations and scientists are regularly discovering new ones. For
us it is not necessary to learn about each subclass, from Th1 to Th17,
it’s too complicated and often the differences are very subtle. Like a
knight using a sword and a champion using a spear. In the end both
subclasses stab monsters with sharp things until they stop moving. We
will only mention specific subclasses when they are important enough to
do so.</p>
<p>21 Weapon Factories and Sniper Rifles: B Cells and Antibodies</p>
<p>B Cells are large, blob-like fellows that share a few characteristics
and properties with T Cells, namely that they originate in the bone
marrow and that they have to undergo the same brutal and deadly
education—only it doesn’t happen in the Thymus but directly in the bone
marrow.1</p>
<p>Just like their T Cell buddies, all your B Cells combined come with
at least hundreds of millions to billions of different receptors for
millions of different antigens. And just like T Cells, every single
individual B Cell has one specific receptor that is able to recognize
one specific antigen.</p>
<p>What makes B Cells special, and very dangerous for friends and foes,
is that they produce the most potent and specialized weapon the immune
system has at its disposal: Antibodies. Antibodies are weird things and
pretty complex and fascinating, so we will brush over them here and
discuss them in the detail they deserve a bit later, but in a
nutshell—Antibodies are basically B Cell receptors. Antibodies
themselves are a bit like crab-like sniper rifles, as they have been
made against a specific antigen—and therefore a specific enemy—so they
in the metaphorical sense hit a pathogen right between the eyes.</p>
<p>OK wait, how can something be a receptor and a weapon that floats
around at the same time? So basically, Antibodies are stuck to the
surface of B Cells and work as their B Cell receptors, which means that
they can stick to an antigen and activate the cell. Once a B Cell is
activated it begins to produce thousands of new Antibodies and starts to
vomit them out, so they can attack your enemies—up to 2,000 per second.
All Antibodies are produced this way. But they’ll get the love and
attention they need after we finish explaining the B Cells that produce
them. For now remember only one thing: Antibodies are B Cell receptors
that are vomited out by the cell by the thousands per second when they
are activated!</p>
<p>Before we go on, a short disclaimer. B Cell activation and their life
cycle are complicated. Many things we learned about come together here,
a lot of stuff is going on simultaneously as there are a lot of parts of
the immune system that become intensely intertwined. So while you read
the next few paragraphs you may think “Phew, this is a lot to take in.”
Don’t worry, we will take breaks and summarize and solidify what we
learn in this chapter.</p>
<p>This is the most complex process we will describe in this book, so
we’ll take it slowly and one step after another. The payoff is really
worth it because once you roughly understand this layer of complexity,
even on a surface level, you can really appreciate how seriously
breathtaking your immune system is. Also afterwards the rest of the book
is smooth sailing.</p>
<p>OK, let’s get on with it! So as we said in the beginning B Cells are
born in your bone marrow where they mix and recombine the gene segments
responsible for their B Cell Receptors to be able to connect to one
specific antigen (if you think back to our metaphor with cooking a lot
of tasty dishes, each B Cell with its specific receptors represents one
dish). After they did that, similarly to T Cells, they have to undergo a
harsh and deadly education to make sure that they are not able to
connect their unique receptors to the proteins and molecules of your own
body. The survivors become traveling virgin B Cells, inactive cells that
move through your lymphatic system every day, just like T Cells, making
the trip from New York to L.A., stopping in hundreds of towns and rest
stops to check if someone is looking for them. But this is where the
similarities between T and B Cells end.</p>
<p>In the lymph node megacities there are specific B Cell areas where
they hang out for a bit and have a coffee and a chat, waiting a bit to
see if they are needed. B Cells are very dangerous cells, so they need a
strict two-factor authentication to be truly activated—one by the Innate
Immune System and another one by the Adaptive Immune System!</p>
<p>We’ll break this down into individual steps and summarize them at the
end.</p>
<p>Step One: B Cell Activation by the Innate Immune System</p>
<p>To understand the first step we need to think back to the
infrastructure of your immune system and how it is connected. Let’s
remember the infection of your toe, where a massive battle has been
going on between your Macrophages and Neutrophils and the bacteria that
infected your flesh, for maybe a day or two.</p>
<p>This battle has not been without casualties, and lots and lots of
bacteria have been killed. Many of them have been swallowed whole by
your Macrophages but this is not all. Many others were ripped apart by
the dangerous weapons of Neutrophils, they got bled out by complement
proteins (the invisible army) ripping holes into them, or they were torn
apart trying to escape a Neutrophil NET (if you forgot what these were,
this was the part where Neutrophils basically exploded their DNA, spiked
with harmful chemicals, to create barriers around them to trap
pathogens). Just through the sheer violent efforts of the immune
reactions, a lot of death was dished out.</p>
<p>Given enough time, eventually your immune cells will clean up but for
now they are more concerned with killing and fighting bacteria that are
still alive. So the battlefield is filled with death and suffering. A
considerable number of bacteria pieces and carcasses float around at the
site of infection, many of them covered by complement proteins. It is
really like a war where combatants fight knee-deep in the bloody and
ripped-apart bodies of their enemies and friends.</p>
<p>But already the ingenious mechanisms of your immune system
infrastructure begin to clean up and filter. As we mentioned before,
inflammation ordered by the immune cells and caused by other dying cells
diverts a lot of fluid from your blood to an infection, which floods the
battlefield considerably. The longer the fighting is going on, the more
fluid is coming in. But this can’t go on forever or your tissue would
burst, so some of the fluid also has to leave the site of infection
again.</p>
<p>We did learn before what your body does with excess fluids in your
tissue, it consistently washes them away, right into the Lymphatic
System. The fluid and with it a lot of the battlefield detritus, with
parts of dead bacteria and spent cytokines and other garbage, become
part of your Lymph. Remember lymph is this weird, slightly disgusting
fluid that is constantly collected from all the tissues in your body.
And in the case of an infection, the lymph is carrying all the dead and
dismantled bacteria with it, a lot of them covered in complement
proteins. This way the lymph flowing through you is a liquid information
carrier.</p>
<p>And this information is headed towards the next immune system base,
the megacities and intelligence centers of the lymph nodes. Once it
arrives here it is drained through the B Cell area where thousands of
virgin B Cells hang out. The B Cells get right in the middle of the
stream of fluid information and let the lymph flow around them and their
B Cell receptors, which sift and explore all the antigens and detritus
coming from your tissue.</p>
<p>The virgin B Cells look specifically for antigens they can connect to
with their special and unique B Cell receptors. They are fishing for the
one antigen they can connect to, so they know they can activate!</p>
<p>OK, so far so good, but you may have noticed something: There is no
Dendritic Cell involved here, so does this mean B Cells don’t need to go
through this dance with another cell? It all has to do with a huge
difference between T Cell receptors and B Cell receptors and it is
important enough that we will explain it right now. Let’s do this with
sausages again!</p>
<p>Remember the MHC class II molecule? The hot dog bun that presented an
antigen, the wiener, to the T Cell receptors, so it could activate? T
Cell receptors are really picky eaters that eat only wieners and only if
they come inside a bun. But this has a major consequence for T Cells:
The antigens that can activate T Cell receptors have to be pretty short
because the MHC molecule can only carry short antigens. The hot dog bun
on the Dendritic Cell can only hold wieners. In contrast, the B Cell
receptors are not as picky.</p>
<p>Both T and B Cell receptors are each made to recognize a specific
antigen, but your B Cells are far less restricted. So T and B Cells
recognize very different things in size and dimension. Not only can B
Cells pick antigens right from the fluids around them and activate, they
also can sort of pick up a much larger piece of meat, to get back into
our food metaphor.</p>
<p>Wieners are highly processed meats that don’t have a strong
resemblance to the animal parts that they are made of. And so are the
antigens T Cells can recognize. The antigens B Cell receptors can
recognize are a bit like huge roasted turkey legs, with bone and skin. T
Cells are way too picky for that, B Cells don’t care.</p>
<p>And B Cells do not need an MHC molecule, they don’t need to get a
presentation from another cell like T Cells do. No, B Cells can pick up
large antigen chunks (the turkey drumsticks) directly from the lymph
that flows through your lymph nodes.</p>
<p>OK, so we learned two things now: Virgin B Cells sit in your lymph
nodes, where they bathe in lymph and take in all the antigens that are
transported through the area from the closest battlefield. Their B Cell
Receptors can just grab big chunks of antigens directly from the lymph
and this way B Cells can get activated.</p>
<p>But there is more: B Cells do have more direct help from the Innate
Immune System. Did you think it was suspicious that we kept mentioning
that the bacteria from the battlefield were covered in complement
proteins? B Cells cannot just recognize the dead bacteria antigens, they
also have special receptors that are able to recognize complement
proteins.</p>
<p>We mentioned before that the Innate Immune System is responsible for
activating and providing context to the Adaptive Immune System and here
we are encountering this principle once more! By being attached to the
pathogens, the complement system is officially confirming to the B Cell
that there is a real danger. So complement proteins attached to an
antigen makes it about 100 times easier to activate a B Cell than it
would be to activate it without the complement. This multilayered
complexity of parts interacting so elegantly and communicating with so
much care is one of the things that make the immune system so beautiful
and amazing. (You can imagine complement proteins on an antigen as a
really nice sauce on the turkey leg, which makes it even tastier to your
B Cells.)</p>
<p>Fun fact, this was just step one of the B Cell activation, but it is
already incredibly important because it will trigger a quick reaction to
an infection. Without any extra steps, these simple mechanisms that
happen on their own because the lymphatic system is always draining your
tissue, are creating a relatively fast response. This is especially
important in the early stages of an infection, when not that many
Dendritic Cells have reached the lymph nodes to activate Helper T
Cells.</p>
<p>OK, take a short breather and revisit what we just learned:
Battlefield, dead bacteria covered in complement, lymph taking away
these carcasses, B Cells inside the lymph node pick it up, and now
finally: Early B Cell activation!</p>
<p>What does this early activation look like? Well, first of all the
activated B Cell moves to another area in the lymph node and begins
cloning itself. One becomes two, two become four, four become eight, and
so on. This cloning continues until there are roughly 20,000 identical
clones, all with copies of the specific receptor that was able to
connect to the original antigen, the first virgin B Cells picked up.
These B Cell clones begin producing Antibodies that use the blood as a
lift to the site of infection and can flood the battlefield and help
out—although they are second-rate antibodies. They are OK at their job
but not amazing, snipers that land more body shots than head shots.</p>
<p>Without a second step, without activation number two, most of these B
Cell clones will kill themselves within a day. Which makes a lot of
sense actually because if they don’t get activated again, these B Cells
have to assume the infection was pretty mild and they are not actually
needed that badly—so to not waste any resources or do any needless
damage, they will kill themselves.</p>
<p>To be truly awakened we need the second part of the two-factor
authentication. And this one is provided to the B Cells by their
colleagues from the Adaptive Immune System, or more precisely, by
activated Helper T Cells.</p>
<p>Step Two: B Cell Activation by the Adaptive Immune System</p>
<p>As we learned in the last chapter, after a Helper T Cell has been
activated and has made a lot of clones of itself, one group of the
Helper T Cells moves to the battlefield while the other group goes off
to activate B Cells for real.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, an activated T Cell needs to find an activated B Cell
and BOTH cells need to be able to recognize the same antigen! OK, wait a
second. So are we seriously saying that two cells in your body mix gene
fragments randomly, with hundreds of millions to billions of possible
outcomes? And then a pathogen shows up and coincidentally both need to
be activated independently and then they need to meet each other? And
only then, in this absurdly specific and seemingly impossibly unlikely
case will your immune response fully be activated? Well yes, although
the way this works is a bit mind-bending and the fact that nature came
up with it is extremely elegant.</p>
<p>Basically, in order to be properly activated, B Cells have to become
antigen-presenting cells. This works because B Cell Receptors are very
different from T Cell receptors, which need the hot dog bun to recognize
a very tiny piece of antigen. Picky eater vs not picky eater,
remember?</p>
<p>So when a B Cell receptor connects to a turkey drumstick, a big chunk
of antigen, it swallows it and processes it inside itself, just like a
Dendritic Cell would. It slices the big chunk of meat up into dozens or
even hundreds of tiny sausage parts, all the size of wieners. And these
tiny parts are then put into MHC molecules (hot dog buns) on the surface
of the B Cell. Basically, a B Cell takes a complex antigen and turns it
into many processed, simpler pieces that are then presented to the
Helper T Cell.</p>
<p>Think about what the immune system is doing here, it increases the
chance that a B Cell and a T Cell are able to match with each other
massively. The B Cell is not just presenting a single specific antigen.
It is presenting dozens or even hundreds of different ones in its MHC
molecules! Hundreds of different wiener-sized sausage pieces in hundreds
of different hot dog buns. So technically, the B and T Cells don’t
recognize the exact same antigen. This is good enough for the Adaptive
Immune System because this means if a Helper T Cell can connect to the
antigen presented by a B Cell, there is an enemy out there and both
cells are able to recognize it. This is the secret of B Cell activation:
B Cells can ONLY be fully activated through the two-factor
authentication.</p>
<p>OK, stop! All of this is a lot of information.</p>
<p>And if your head is smoking and your eyes are spinning right now,
this is actually the correct reaction. There are a lot of things going
on, over a long amount of time, in many different places and a lot of
different cells. So you are in good company if you are confused and it
is time to summarize what happened here.</p>
<p>Step 1: A battle needs to occur and dead enemies, which are big
chunks of antigens (turkey drumsticks), need to float through the lymph
node. Here, a B Cell, with a specific receptor needs to connect to the
antigen. If the dead enemy is covered in complement, activation will be
much easier. This will activate the B Cell, which makes a lot of copies
of itself and produces low-grade antibodies, but the B Cells will die
after around a day if nothing more happens.</p>
<p>Step 2: In the meantime, a Dendritic Cell needs to pick up enemies at
the battlefield and turn them into antigens (wieners) which are put in
the MHC class II molecules (hot dog buns) and travel to the T Cell
dating area in the lymph node. Here it needs to find a Helper T Cell
that is able to recognize the antigen with its unique T Cell receptor
(eat the wiener from the bun). If this happens the Helper T Cell is
activated and makes a lot of copies of itself.</p>
<p>Step 3: The B Cell breaks the big chunk of antigen (turkey drumstick)
down into dozens or hundreds of small antigens (wiener sized) and begins
presenting them in MHC class II molecules (hot dog buns).</p>
<p>Step 4: An activated B Cell that is presenting hundreds of different
antigens (wiener-sized sausage pieces) needs to meet a T Cell that can
recognize one of these antigens with its specific T Cell receptor, which
is the second signal for the B Cell.</p>
<p>Only if this exact sequence of events occurs does a B Cell get
activated for real. Are you impressed yet with your biology?2</p>
<p>Can you appreciate the level of sophistication that is happening
here? How insane it is to make billions of individual T and B Cells,
activate them individually through different paths, and then expect them
to meet each other? Evolution and time are truly incredible at crafting
insanely complex and elegant mechanisms. If this sequence of events
happens, the last and most powerful stage of the Adaptive Immune System
finally starts up in earnest and awakens. Now all the conditions the
immune system could ever ask for have been fulfilled. It now knows for
sure that there are a lot of enemies active inside the body.</p>
<p>Your B Cell that was properly activated through the two-factor
authentication now changes. It has waited its whole life for this
moment. It begins to swell, to almost double its size, and transforms
into its final form: the Plasma Cell.3</p>
<p>The Plasma Cell now begins producing antibodies for real. It can
release up to 2,000 antibodies per second that saturate the lymph and
blood and the fluids between your tissue. Like the Soviet rocket
batteries in World War II that could send a never-ending barrage of
missiles on enemy positions, antibodies are made in the millions and
become every enemy’s worst nightmare, from bacteria to viruses or
parasites. Even cancer cells. Or, if you are unlucky and have an
autoimmune disease, your own cells.</p>
<p>OK. Phew. What a complicated affair. But wait, there is more, one
last aspect of B Cell activation that makes this process even more
genius. Now your immune system truly begins beating microbes in their
own game as a beautiful dance begins, a dance that makes your defenses
even better and stronger.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>1 Do you think the “B” in the name “B Cell” was chosen since B Cells
originate from the bone marrow, because the T Cell has its “T” from the
Thymus? Well sorry, no, that is just a coincidence and would make way
too much sense to fit into the mess that is the language of immunology.
The “B” in B Cells comes from the “Bursa of Fabricius,” which is a
saclike mini organ that sits right above the end of the gut in birds.
This organ had been known for hundreds of years but nobody had an idea
what it was doing. Until a graduate student did some work with chickens
who were missing their bursas and subsequently found that they were
unable to produce Antibodies. He discovered B Cells, the factories that
produce Antibodies, and that they were made in this weird little organ
in birds, which was a huge breakthrough in immunology and created an
entire new field of study. Humans don’t have a bursa, we use our bone
marrow to make B Cells. But yeah, while the name makes sense, it still
is a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>2 Funny story: This is actually still simplified and we are leaving
out a few major details that are actually pretty important. We’ll
address some of them at various places in the book. But honestly, this
stuff is mind-bendingly unintuitive and hard even in a strongly
simplified form. If you manage to remember that B Cells activate by
picking up stuff themselves and then get activated a second time by T
Cells, that is already amazing. You don’t need to remember any more
details than that to know an impressive amount about your immune system!
But this stuff is just too cool to not try to get this magic across.</p>
<p>3 If you happen to be just the right age this might mean something to
you: In a sense, B Cells are Saiya-jin and Plasma Cells are Super
Saiya-jin. For everyone who never watched Dragon Ball Z, this is just a
charming way of saying that B Cells are strong fighters and Plasma Cells
extremely strong fighters, also possibly blond with a lot of product in
their hair. Let’s end this footnote before it becomes more
embarrassing.</p>
