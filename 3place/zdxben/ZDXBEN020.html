<h4 id="what-is-a-virus">26 What Is a Virus?</h4>
<p>Viruses are the simplest of all self-replicating sorts of living
things, although, depending on who you ask, they may not even be
considered alive. We talked about the lack of consciousness and
awareness of your cells. That they are just really complex piles of
biochemistry that do what the genetic code and the chemical reactions
between their parts compel them to do. Bacteria are the same, protein
robots able to do amazing things, although, in a sense, they could be
considered a bit less sophisticated.</p>
<p>Viruses are not even that. The fact that a virus is able to do
anything at all is equally depressing and fascinating. A virus is not
much more than a hull filled with a few lines of genetic code and a few
proteins. They completely rely on proper living things to stick
around.</p>
<p>And they got extremely good at that.</p>
<p>It is not clear yet when or how exactly viruses came into existence,
but it is very likely that they are ancient and already existed when the
last common ancestor of all living things on earth was alive, billions
of years ago. Some scientists think viruses were essential steps in the
emergence of life, others think they are the result of an ancient
bacterium taking the path of becoming simpler instead of more complex
around 1.5 billion years ago. According to this idea, they were living
beings that opted out of the life game and decided to save the effort
and energy of constructing a functioning cell and instead started to
rely on others to do all the hard work.</p>
<p>Whatever the truth is, viruses turned out to be incredibly
successful. In fact, viruses are arguably the most successful entity on
the planet. It is estimated that there are 1031 viruses on earth. Ten
thousand billion, billion, billion individual viruses.*1</p>
<p>How did viruses become so successful, how did they do this? Well, in
a sense, they don’t do anything at all. They don’t have a metabolism,
they don’t react to stimuli, and they can’t multiply. Viruses are so
basic that they have no way to actively do anything. They are literally
particles floating around in the environment and have to rely on
passively stumbling into victims by pure random chance.</p>
<p>If all other forms of life were to go extinct, viruses would
disappear with them. So they need cells, proper living, active cells
that do all that being-alive stuff for them. Some scientists even
suggest that we consider a virus particle more as a reproductive stage,
like a sperm cell, and a cell that is infected by the virus as its true
living form. In any case, viruses are specialized to be vicious and
sneaky intruders because obviously cells don’t want to be infected by
them. The main thing a virus needs to be able to do to thrive is to get
inside cells. And for that they abuse a weak point of all cells that
living things will never be able to completely protect against: They
attack receptors.</p>
<p>We already talked a bunch about receptors, they are the
protein-recognition parts that cover about half of the surface of cells.
But receptors can do much more. They are used for interacting with the
environment, to transport things from the inside to the outside and vice
versa, and they are absolutely essential. The hulls of viruses are
spiked with special proteins that can connect to a receptor type on
their victims’ surface. This means that viruses can’t attach to just any
cell—only to the ones that have a receptor they can attach to. In a
sense every virus has a lot of puzzle-piece proteins that can only
connect to a cell if it happens to have the correct puzzle-piece
receptor.</p>
<p>Viruses are specialists, not generalists, and have preferred prey.
Which is good because as we have established, there are a lot of
viruses—but only about 200 different species infect us humans.</p>
<p>Once a virus gets in contact with the kind of cell it is looking for,
it quietly takes it over. How a virus does this varies a lot from
species to species, but in general a virus transfers its genetic
material into its victim and forces the cell to stop making cell stuff.
It is turned into a virus production machine. Some viruses keep their
victims alive as sort of permanent living virus factories while others
use up the cell as fast as possible. Usually for about 8 to 72 hours,
the resources of the cell are turned into virus parts that get assembled
into new viruses, until the cell is filled up, top to bottom, with
hundreds to tens of thousands of new viruses.</p>
<p>Enveloped viruses leave the cell by budding from it, which means that
they “pinch off” a bit of the cell’s membrane and use it as an extra
protective hull. Other viruses force the infected cell to dissolve and
spill out its insides, including the new army of viruses it was
brainwashed into building, which then go on to infect more cells.</p>
<p>If cells were conscious, viruses would be terrifying to them. Imagine
spiders that don’t crawl on walls, but passively float around the air,
hoping to get into your mouth when you are not careful for a moment,
crawling into your brain and forcing your insides to produce hundreds of
new baby spiders until all your body is filled with them. And then your
skin would burst open and all these new spiders would try to get your
family and friends. This is literally what viruses do to cells.</p>
<p>Pathogenic viruses are excellent at circumventing the immune system
because they have a superpower: Nothing multiplies as fast as they do.
And that also means that nothing mutates or changes as fast as viruses.
They are basically impossible to beat on that front because they are
sloppy and careless. Viruses are so basic that they lack most of the
intricate safeguards your cells have to prevent mutations, so they
mutate all the time.</p>
<p>In general, the chance that a mutation is bad for an organism is
higher than the chance that it is positive. But viruses don’t care:
Through the sheer incredible rate of reproduction and high numbers of
individuals they produce in each reproductive cycle, with each infected
cell, the chances that among a few thousand mutations, one is extremely
beneficial and able to make a virus significantly better suited to
survive is pretty high. It’s the old evolution, brute-force,
throw-shit-at-the-wall-until-something-sticks approach. And it’s quite
effective.*2</p>
<p>Your immune system can’t rely on the same weapons to fight a viral
infection that it uses to fight bacteria as both the enemy and its
tactics are very different. A virus is smaller and somewhat harder to
detect than bacteria because it doesn’t have a metabolism that releases
garbage chemicals that can be picked up by immune cells. And it hides
inside cells for most of its life cycle and tries to manipulate infected
cells to trick the immune system to stand down. It can change much more
quickly than bacteria and a single virus can turn into ten thousand
within a day, turning on exponential growth rapidly. Pathogenic viruses
are terrifyingly dangerous enemies.</p>
<p>So it is no wonder that your immune system has invested heavily in
antivirus defenses.</p>
<p>But before we get to know our weapons, let us visit another mucosa
kingdom, the main entry point for viruses. The majority of pathogenic
viruses enter your body via your respiratory mucosa. And this makes
sense—as we briefly talked about, your Desert Kingdom of the Skin is a
really, really bad place to be if you are a virus that wants to invade
human cells. Layers and layers of dead cells stacked on top of each
other. In contrast, the mucosa of your lung is a very inviting entry
point for a virus. This does not mean it is easy to enter here—just like
the skin, the body created a powerful defensive kingdom here.</p>
<p>Skip Notes</p>
<p>*1 If we somehow collected them and laid them end to end, they would
stretch for 100 million light-years—as many as 500 Milky Way galaxies
put next to each other. In the oceans alone, every single second, one
hundred thousand billion, billion cells get infected by viruses. So
many, actually, that up to 40% of all bacteria in the oceans are killed
by virus infections every single day. And even more, even your most
intimate self is not safe from viruses: About 8% of your DNA is made of
remnants of viral DNA. We’ll stop with the large numbers now because
nobody can picture this stuff anyway. Let us just agree that there are a
whole lot of viruses on earth and they seem to be doing quite all right.
The fact that some apes with pants are discussing if they are alive or
not could not be more irrelevant to them.</p>
<p>*2 Actually this is the only trick evolution has. It tries a lot of
things and whatever does not die before it makes a few offspring gets
another attempt at making offspring before dying. Repeat this often
enough and you get the amazing variety of living things on earth. And
new strains of cold viruses every season. So basically it’s a mixed
bag.</p>
