<h4 id="on-work">On Work</h4>
<p>hen a ploughman said, “Speak to us of Work.“</p>
<p>And he answered, saying:</p>
<p>You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the
earth.</p>
<p>For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step
out of life’s procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission
towards the infinite.</p>
<p>When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of
the hours turns to music.</p>
<p>Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings
together in unison?</p>
<p>Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a
misfortune.</p>
<p>But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth’s
furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born, And in keeping
yourself with labour you are in truth loving life, And to love life
through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret.</p>
<p>But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of
the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but
the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>You have been told also life is darkness, and in your weariness you
echo what was said by the weary.</p>
<p>And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge, And
all urge is blind save when there is knowledge, And all knowledge is
vain save when there is work, And all work is empty save when there is
love;</p>
<p>And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one
another, and to God.</p>
<p>And what is it to work with love?</p>
<p>It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as
if your beloved were to wear that cloth.</p>
<p>It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were
to dwell in that house.</p>
<p>It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy,
even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.</p>
<p>It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own
spirit, And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and
watching.</p>
<p>Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, “he who works in
marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is a nobler
than he who ploughs the soil.</p>
<p>And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of
man, is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet.“</p>
<p>But I say, not in sleep but in the over-wakefulness of noontide, that
the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of
all the blades of grass;</p>
<p>And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song
made sweeter by his own loving.</p>
<p>Work is love made visible.</p>
<p>And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better
that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and
take alms of those who work with joy.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that
feeds but half man’s hunger.</p>
<p>And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils a
poison in the wine.</p>
<p>And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you
muffle man’s ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the
night.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>On Joy andandandand Sorrow</p>
<p>hen a woman said, “Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow.“</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.</p>
<p>And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes
filled with your tears.</p>
<p>And how else can it be?</p>
<p>The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can
contain.</p>
<p>Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in
the potter’s oven?</p>
<p>And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was
hollowed with knives?</p>
<p>When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it
is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.</p>
<p>When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see
that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.</p>
<p>Some of you say, “Joy is greater than sorrow,“ and others say, “Nay,
sorrow is the greater.“</p>
<p>But I say unto you, they are inseparable.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board,
remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.</p>
<p>Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your
joy.</p>
<p>Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.</p>
<p>When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver,
needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.</p>
<p>23</p>
