<h4 id="letter-to-orion-clemens-in-keokuk-iowa">LETTER to Orion Clemens,
in Keokuk, Iowa:</h4>
<p>NOV. 29, ’88. Jesus Christ!–It is perilous to write such a man. You
can go crazy on less material than anybody that ever lived. What in hell
has produced all these maniacal imaginings? You told me you had hired an
attendant for ma. Now hire one instantly, and stop this nonsense of
wearing Mollie and yourself out trying to do that nursing yourselves.
Hire the attendant, and tell me her cost so that I can instruct Webster
andandandand Co. to add it every month to what they already send. Don’t
fool away any more time about this. And don’t write me any more damned
rot about “storms,“ and inability to pay trivial sums of money
and–and–hell and damnation! You see I’ve read only the first page of
your letter; I wouldn’t read the rest for a million dollars. Yr SAM.</p>
<p>P. S. Don’t imagine that I have lost my temper, because I swear. I
swear all day, but I do not lose my temper. And don’t imagine that I am
on my way to the poorhouse, for I am not; or that I am uneasy, for I am
not; or that I am uncomfortable or unhappy–for I never am. I don’t know
what it is to be unhappy or uneasy; and I am not going to try to learn
how, at this late day. SAM.</p>
<p>Few men were ever interviewed oftener than Mark Twain, yet he never
welcomed interviewers and was seldom satisfied with them. “What I say in
an interview loses it character in print,“ he often remarked, “all its
life and personality. The reporter realizes this himself, and tries to
improve upon me, but he doesn’t help matters any.“</p>
<p>Edward W. Bok, before he became editor of the Ladies Home Journal,
was conducting a weekly syndicate column under the title of “Bok’s
Literary Leaves.“ It usually consisted of news and gossip of writers,
comment, etc., literary odds and ends, and occasional interviews with
distinguished authors. He went up to Hartford one day to interview Mark
Twain. The result seemed satisfactory to Bok, but wishing to be certain
that it would be satisfactory to Clemens, he sent him a copy for
approval. The interview was not returned; in the place of it came a
letter-not altogether disappointing, as the reader may believe.</p>
<p>To Edward W. Bok, in New York:</p>
<p>MY DEAR MR. BOK,–No, no. It is like most interviews, pure twaddle and
valueless.</p>
<p>For several quite plain and simple reasons, an “interview“ must, as a
rule, be an absurdity, and chiefly for this reason–It is an attempt to
use a boat on land or a wagon on water, to speak figuratively. Spoken
speech is one thing, written speech is quite another. Print is the
proper vehicle for the latter, but it isn’t for the former. The moment
“talk“ is put into print you recognize that it is not what it was when
you heard it; you perceive that an immense something has disappeared
from it. That is its soul. You have nothing but a dead carcass left on
your hands. Color, play of feature, the varying modulations of the
voice, the laugh, the smile, the informing inflections, everything that
gave that body warmth, grace, friendliness and charm and commended it to
your affections–or, at least, to your tolerance–is gone and nothing is
left but a pallid, stiff and repulsive cadaver.</p>
<p>Such is “talk“ almost invariably, as you see it lying in state in an
“interview“. The interviewer seldom tries to tell one how a thing was
said; he merely puts in the naked remark and stops there. When one
writes for print his methods are very different. He follows forms which
have but little resemblance to conversation, but they make the reader
understand what the writer is trying to convey. And when the writer is
making a story and finds it necessary to report some of the talk of his
characters observe how cautiously and anxiously he goes at that risky
and difficult thing. “If he had dared to say that thing in my presence,“
said Alfred, “taking a mock heroic attitude, and casting an arch glance
upon the company, blood would have flowed.“</p>
<p>“If he had dared to say that thing in my presence,“ said Hawkwood,
with that in his eye which caused more than one heart in that guilty
assemblage to quake, “blood would have flowed.“</p>
<p>“If he had dared to say that thing in my presence,“ said the paltry
blusterer, with valor on his tongue and pallor on his lips, “blood would
have flowed.“</p>
<p>So painfully aware is the novelist that naked talk in print conveys
no meaning that he loads, and often overloads, almost every utterance of
his characters with explanations and interpretations. It is a loud
confession that print is a poor vehicle for “talk“; it is a recognition
that uninterpreted talk in print would result in confusion to the
reader, not instruction.</p>
<p>Now, in your interview, you have certainly been most accurate; you
have set down the sentences I uttered as I said them. But you have not a
word of explanation; what my manner was at several points is not
indicated. Therefore, no reader can possibly know where I was in earnest
and where I was joking; or whether I was joking altogether or in earnest
altogether. Such a report of a conversation has no value. It can convey
many meanings to the reader, but never the right one. To add
interpretations which would convey the right meaning is a something
which would require –what? An art so high and fine and difficult that no
possessor of it would ever be allowed to waste it on interviews.</p>
<p>No; spare the reader, and spare me; leave the whole interview out; it
is rubbish. I wouldn’t talk in my sleep if I couldn’t talk better than
that.</p>
<p>If you wish to print anything print this letter; it may have some
value, for it may explain to a reader here and there why it is that in
interviews, as a rule, men seem to talk like anybody but themselves.
Very sincerely yours, MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>XXI</p>
<p>XLETTERS, 1889. THE MACHINE. DEATH OF MR. CRANE. CONCLUSION OF THE
YANKEE</p>
<p>In January, 1889, Clemens believed, after his long seven years of
waiting, fruition had come in the matter of the type machine. Paige, the
inventor, seemed at last to have given it its finishing touches. The
mechanical marvel that had cost so much time, mental stress, and a
fortune in money, stood complete, responsive to the human will and touch
–the latest, and one of the greatest, wonders of the world. To George
Standring, a London printer and publisher, Clemens wrote: “The machine
is finished!“ and added, “This is by far the most marvelous invention
ever contrived by man. And it is not a thing of rags and patches; it is
made of massive steel, and will last a century.“</p>
<p>In his fever of enthusiasm on that day when he had actually seen it
in operation, he wrote a number of exuberant letters. They were more or
less duplicates, but as the one to his brother is of fuller detail and
more intimate than the others, it has been selected for preservation
here.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in Keokuk:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Jan. 5, ’89. DEAR ORION,–At 12.20 this afternoon a line of
movable types was spaced and justified by machinery, for the first time
in the history of the world! And I was there to see. It was done
automatically–instantly –perfectly. This is indeed the first line of
movable types that ever was perfectly spaced and perfectly justified on
this earth.</p>
<p>This was the last function that remained to be tested–and so by long
odds the most amazing and extraordinary invention ever born of the brain
of man stands completed and perfect. Livy is down stairs
celebrating.</p>
<p>But it’s a cunning devil, is that machine!–and knows more than any
man that ever lived. You shall see. We made the test in this way. We set
up a lot of random letters in a stick–three-fourths of a line; then
filled out the line with quads representing 14 spaces, each space to be
35/1000 of an inch thick. Then we threw aside the quads and put the
letters into the machine and formed them into 15 two-letter words,
leaving the words separated by two-inch vacancies. Then we started up
the machine slowly, by hand, and fastened our eyes on the
space-selecting pins. The first pin-block projected its third pin as the
first word came traveling along the race-way; second block did the same;
but the third block projected its second pin!</p>
<p>“Oh, hell! stop the machine–something wrong–it’s going to set a
30/1000 space!“</p>
<p>General consternation. “A foreign substance has got into the spacing
plates.“ This from the head mathematician.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is the trouble,“ assented the foreman.</p>
<p>Paige examined. “No–look in, and you can see that there’s nothing of
the kind.“ Further examination. “Now I know what it is–what it must be:
one of those plates projects and binds. It’s too bad–the first test is a
failure.“ A pause. “Well, boys, no use to cry. Get to work –take the
machine down.–No–Hold on! don’t touch a thing! Go right ahead! We are
fools, the machine isn’t. The machine knows what it’s about. There is a
speck of dirt on one of those types, and the machine is putting in a
thinner space to allow for it!“</p>
<p>That was just it. The machine went right ahead, spaced the line,
justified it to a hair, and shoved it into the galley complete and
perfect! We took it out and examined it with a glass. You could not tell
by your eye that the third space was thinner than the others, but the
glass and the calipers showed the difference. Paige had always said that
the machine would measure invisible particles of dirt and allow for
them, but even he had forgotten that vast fact for the moment.</p>
<p>All the witnesses made written record of the immense historical birth
–the first justification of a line of movable type by machinery–and also
set down the hour and the minute. Nobody had drank anything, and yet
everybody seemed drunk. Well-dizzy, stupefied, stunned.</p>
<p>All the other wonderful inventions of the human brain sink pretty
nearly into commonplace contrasted with this awful mechanical miracle.
Telephones, telegraphs, locomotives, cotton gins, sewing machines,
Babbage calculators, jacquard looms, perfecting presses, Arkwright’s
frames–all mere toys, simplicities! The Paige Compositor marches alone
and far in the lead of human inventions.</p>
<p>In two or three weeks we shall work the stiffness out of her joints
and have her performing as smoothly and softly as human muscles, and
then we shall speak out the big secret and let the world come and
gaze.</p>
<p>Return me this letter when you have read it.</p>
<p>SAM.</p>
<p>Judge of the elation which such a letter would produce in Keokuk! Yet
it was no greater than that which existed in Hartford–for a time.</p>
<p>Then further delays. Before the machine got “the stiffness out of her
joints“ that “cunning devil“ manifested a tendency to break the types,
and Paige, who was never happier than when he was pulling things to
pieces and making improvements, had the type-setter apart again and the
day of complete triumph was postponed.</p>
<p>There was sadness at the Elmira farm that spring. Theodore Crane, who
had long been in poor health, seemed to grow daily worse. In February he
had paid a visit to Hartford and saw the machine in operation, but by
the end of May his condition was very serious. Remembering his keen
sense of humor, Clemens reported to him cheering and amusing
incidents.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Theodore Crane. in Elmira, N. Y.:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, May 28, ’89. Susie dear, I want you to tell this to
Theodore. You know how absent-minded Twichell is, and how desolate his
face is when he is in that frame. At such times, he passes the word with
a friend on the street and is not aware of the meeting at all. Twice in
a week, our Clara had this latter experience with him within the past
month. But the second instance was too much for her, and she woke him
up, in his tracks, with a reproach. She said:</p>
<p>“Uncle Joe, why do you always look as if you were just going down
into the grave, when you meet a person on the street?“–and then went on
to reveal to him the funereal spectacle which he presented on such
occasions. Well, she has met Twichell three times since then, and would
swim the Connecticut to avoid meeting him the fourth. As soon as he
sights her, no matter how public the place nor how far off she is, he
makes a bound into the air, heaves arms and legs into all sorts of
frantic gestures of delight, and so comes prancing, skipping and
pirouetting for her like a drunken Indian entering heaven.</p>
<p>With a full invoice of love from us all to you and Theodore.</p>
<p>S. L. C.</p>
<p>The reference in the next to the “closing sentence“ in a letter
written by Howells to Clemens about this time, refers to a heart-broken
utterance of the former concerning his daughter Winnie, who had died
some time before. She had been a gentle talented girl, but never of
robust health. Her death had followed a long period of gradual
decline.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Judy 13, ’89. DEAR HOWELLS,–I came on from Elmira a day or
two ago, where I left a house of mourning. Mr. Crane died, after ten
months of pain and two whole days of dying, at the farm on the hill, the
3rd inst: A man who had always hoped for a swift death. Mrs. Crane and
Mrs. Clemens and the children were in a gloom which brought back to me
the days of nineteen years ago, when Mr. Langdon died. It is
heart-breaking to see Mrs. Crane. Many a time, in the past ten days, the
sight of her has reminded me, with a pang, of the desolation which
uttered itself in the closing sentence of your last letter to me. I do
see that there is an argument against suicide: the grief of the
worshipers left behind; the awful famine in their hearts, these are too
costly terms for the release.</p>
<p>I shall be here ten days yet, and all alone: nobody in the house but
the servants. Can’t Mrs. Howells spare you to me? Can’t you come and
stay with me? The house is cool and pleasant; your work will not be
interrupted; we will keep to ourselves and let the rest of the world do
the same; you can have your choice of three bedrooms, and you will find
the Children’s schoolroom (which was built for my study,) the perfection
of a retired and silent den for work. There isn’t a fly or a mosquito on
the estate. Come–say you will.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to Mrs. Howells, and Pilla and John, Yours Ever
MARK.</p>
<p>Howells was more hopeful. He wrote: “I read something in a strange
book, The Physical Theory of Another Life, that consoles a little;
namely, we see and feel the power of Deity in such fullness that we
ought to infer the infinite justice and Goodness which we do not see or
feel.“ And a few days later, he wrote: “I would rather see and talk with
you than any other man in the world outside my own blood.“</p>
<p>A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur’s Court was brought to an end
that year and given to the artist and printer. Dan Beard was selected
for the drawings, and was given a free hand, as the next letter
shows.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, Manager Charles L. Webster andandandand Co.:</p>
<p>[Charles L. Webster, owing to poor health, had by this time retired
from the firm.]</p>
<p>ELMIRA, July 20, ’89. DEAR MR. HALL,–Upon reflection–thus: tell Beard
to obey his own inspiration, and when he sees a picture in his mind put
that picture on paper, be it humorous or be it serious. I want his
genius to be wholly unhampered, I shan’t have fears as to the result.
They will be better pictures than if I mixed in and tried to give him
points on his own trade.</p>
<p>Send this note and he’ll understand. Yr S. L. C.</p>
<p>Clemens had made a good choice in selecting Beard for the
illustrations. He was well qualified for the work, and being of a
socialistic turn of mind put his whole soul into it. When the drawings
were completed, Clemens wrote: “Hold me under permanent obligations.
What luck it was to find you! There are hundreds of artists that could
illustrate any other book of mine, but there was only one who could
illustrate this one. Yes, it was a fortunate hour that I went netting
for lightning bugs and caught a meteor. Live forever!“</p>
<p>Clemens, of course, was anxious for Howells to read The Yankee, and
Mrs. Clemens particularly so. Her eyes were giving her trouble that
summer, so that she could not read the MS. for herself, and she had
grave doubts as to some of its chapters. It may be said here that the
book to-day might have been better if Mrs. Clemens had been able to read
it. Howells was a peerless critic, but the revolutionary subject-matter
of the book so delighted him that he was perhaps somewhat blinded to its
literary defects. However, this is premature. Howells did not at once
see the story. He had promised to come to Hartford, but wrote that
trivial matters had made his visit impossible. From the next letter we
get the situation at this time. The “Mr. Church“ mentioned was Frederick
S. Church, the well-known artist.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, July 24, ’89. DEAR HOWELLS,–I, too, was as sorry as I could
be; yes, and desperately disappointed. I even did a heroic thing:
shipped my book off to New York lest I should forget hospitality and
embitter your visit with it. Not that I think you wouldn’t like to read
it, for I think you would; but not on a holiday that’s not the time. I
see how you were situated–another familiarity of Providence and wholly
wanton intrusion–and of course we could not help ourselves. Well, just
think of it: a while ago, while Providence’s attention was absorbed in
disordering some time-tables so as to break up a trip of mine to
Mr. Church’s on the Hudson, that Johnstown dam got loose. I swear I was
afraid to pray, for fear I should laugh. Well, I’m not going to despair;
we’ll manage a meet yet.</p>
<p>I expect to go to Hartford again in August and maybe remain till I
have to come back here and fetch the family. And, along there in August,
some time, you let on that you are going to Mexico, and I will let on
that I am going to Spitzbergen, and then under cover of this clever
stratagem we will glide from the trains at Worcester and have a time. I
have noticed that Providence is indifferent about Mexico and
Spitzbergen. Ys Ever MARK.</p>
<p>Possibly Mark Twain was not particularly anxious that Howells should
see his MS., fearing that he might lay a ruthless hand on some of his
more violent fulminations and wild fancies. However this may be, further
postponement was soon at an end. Mrs. Clemens’s eyes troubled her and
would not permit her to read, so she requested that the Yankee be passed
upon by soberminded critics, such as Howells and Edmund Clarence
Stedman. Howells wrote that even if he hadn’t wanted to read the book
for its own sake, or for the author’s sake, he would still want to do it
for Mrs. Clemens’s. Whereupon the proofs were started in his
direction.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Aug. 24, ’89. DEAR HOWELLS,–If you should be moved to speak
of my book in the Study, I shall be glad and proud–and the sooner it
gets in, the better for the book; though I don’t suppose you can get it
in earlier than the November number–why, no, you can’t get it in till a
month later than that. Well, anyway I don’t think I’ll send out any
other press copy–except perhaps to Stedman. I’m not writing for those
parties who miscall themselves critics, and I don’t care to have them
paw the book at all. It’s my swan-song, my retirement from literature
permanently, and I wish to pass to the cemetery unclodded.</p>
<p>I judge that the proofs have begun to reach you about this time, as I
had some (though not revises,) this morning. I’m sure I’m going to be
charmed with Beard’s pictures. Observe his nice take-off of Middle-Age
art-dinner-table scene. Ys sincerely MARK.</p>
<p>Howells’s approval of the Yankee came almost in the form of exultant
shouts, one after reading each batch of proof. First he wrote: “It’s
charming, original, wonderful! good in fancy and sound to the core in
morals.“ And again, “It’s a mighty great book, and it makes my heart
burn with wrath. It seems God did not forget to put a soul into you. He
shuts most literary men off with a brain, merely.“ Then, a few days
later: “The book is glorious–simply noble; what masses of virgin truth
never touched in print before!“ and, finally, “Last night I read your
last chapter. As Stedman says of the whole book, it’s titanic.“</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Sept. 22, ’89. DEAR HOWELLS,–It is immensely good of you to
grind through that stuff for me; but it gives peace to Mrs. Clemens’s
soul; and I am as grateful to you as a body can be. I am glad you
approve of what I say about the French Revolution. Few people will. It
is odd that even to this day Americans still observe that immortal
benefaction through English and other monarchical eyes, and have no
shred of an opinion about it that they didn’t get at second-hand.</p>
<p>Next to the 4th of July and its results, it was the noblest and the
holiest thing and the most precious that ever happened in this earth.
And its gracious work is not done yet–not anywhere in the remote
neighborhood of it.</p>
<p>Don’t trouble to send me all the proofs; send me the pages with your
corrections on them, and waste-basket the rest. We issue the book
Dec. 10; consequently a notice that appears Dec. 20 will be just in good
time.</p>
<p>I am waiting to see your Study set a fashion in criticism. When that
happens–as please God it must–consider that if you lived three centuries
you couldn’t do a more valuable work for this country, or a humaner.</p>
<p>As a rule a critic’s dissent merely enrages, and so does no good; but
by the new art which you use, your dissent must be as welcome as your
approval, and as valuable. I do not know what the secret of it is,
unless it is your attitude–man courteously reasoning with man and
brother, in place of the worn and wearisome critical attitude of all
this long time–superior being lecturing a boy.</p>
<p>Well, my book is written–let it go. But if it were only to write over
again there wouldn’t be so many things left out. They burn in me; and
they keep multiplying and multiplying; but now they can’t ever be said.
And besides, they would require a library–and a pen warmed up in hell.
Ys Ever MARK.</p>
<p>The type-setting machine began to loom large in the background.
Clemens believed it perfected by this time. Paige had got it together
again and it was running steadily–or approximately so –setting type at a
marvelous speed and with perfect accuracy. In time an expert operator
would be able to set as high as eight thousand ems per hour, or about
ten times as much as a good compositor could set and distribute by hand.
Those who saw it were convinced–most of them–that the type-setting
problem was solved by this great mechanical miracle. If there were any
who doubted, it was because of its marvelously minute accuracy which the
others only admired. Such accuracy, it was sometimes whispered, required
absolutely perfect adjustment, and what would happen when the great
inventor–“the poet in steel,“ as Clemens once called him–was no longer
at hand to supervise and to correct the slightest variation. But no such
breath of doubt came to Mark Twain; he believed the machine as reliable
as a constellation.</p>
<p>But now there was need of capital to manufacture and market the
wonder. Clemens, casting about in his mind, remembered Senator Jones, of
Nevada, a man of great wealth, and his old friend, Joe Goodman, of
Nevada, in whom Jones had unlimited confidence. He wrote to Goodman, and
in this letter we get a pretty full exposition of the whole matter as it
stood in the fall of 1889. We note in this communication that Clemens
says that he has been at the machine three years and seven months, but
this was only the period during which he had spent the regular monthly
sum of three thousand dollars. His interest in the invention had begun
as far back as 1880.</p>
<p>To Joseph T. Goodman, in Nevada:</p>
<p>Private. HARTFORD, Oct. 7, ’89. DEAR JOE,-I had a letter from Aleck
Badlam day before yesterday, and in answering him I mentioned a matter
which I asked him to consider a secret except to you and John
McComb,–[This is Col. McComb, of the Alta-California, who had sent Mark
Twain on the Quaker City excursion]–as I am not ready yet to get into
the newspapers.</p>
<p>I have come near writing you about this matter several times, but it
wasn’t ripe, and I waited. It is ripe, now. It is a type-setting machine
which I undertook to build for the inventor (for a consideration). I
have been at it three years and seven months without losing a day, at a
cost of ,000 a month, and in so private a way that Hartford has known
nothing about it. Indeed only a dozen men have known of the matter. I
have reported progress from time to time to the proprietors of the N. Y.
Sun, Herald, Times, World, Harper Brothers and John F. Trow; also to the
proprietors of the Boston Herald and the Boston Globe. Three years ago I
asked all these people to squelch their frantic desire to load up their
offices with the Mergenthaler (N. Y. Tribune) machine, and wait for mine
and then choose between the two. They have waited–with no very gaudy
patience–but still they have waited; and I could prove to them to-day
that they have not lost anything by it. But I reserve the proof for the
present–except in the case of the N. Y. Herald; I sent an invitation
there the other day–a courtesy due a paper which ordered 40,000 worth of
our machines long ago when it was still in a crude condition. The Herald
has ordered its foreman to come up here next Thursday; but that is the
only invitation which will go out for some time yet.</p>
<p>The machine was finished several weeks ago, and has been running ever
since in the machine shop. It is a magnificent creature of steel, all of
Pratt andandandand Whitney’s super-best workmanship, and as nicely
adjusted and as accurate as a watch. In construction it is as elaborate
and complex as that machine which it ranks next to, by every
right–Man–and in performance it is as simple and sure.</p>
<p>Anybody can set type on it who can read–and can do it after only 15
minutes’ instruction. The operator does not need to leave his seat at
the keyboard; for the reason that he is not required to do anything but
strike the keys and set type–merely one function; the spacing,
justifying, emptying into the galley, and distributing of dead matter is
all done by the machine without anybody’s help–four functions.</p>
<p>The ease with which a cub can learn is surprising. Day before
yesterday I saw our newest cub set, perfectly space and perfectly
justify 2,150 ems of solid nonpareil in an hour and distribute the like
amount in the same hour–and six hours previously he had never seen the
machine or its keyboard. It was a good hour’s work for 3-year veterans
on the other type-setting machines to do. We have 3 cubs. The dean of
the trio is a school youth of 18. Yesterday morning he had been an
apprentice on the machine 16 working days (8-hour days); and we speeded
him to see what he could do in an hour. In the hour he set 5,900 ems
solid nonpareil, and the machine perfectly spaced and justified it, and
of course distributed the like amount in the same hour. Considering that
a good fair compositor sets 700 and distributes 700 in the one hour,
this boy did the work of about 8 x a compositors in that hour. This fact
sends all other type-setting machines a thousand miles to the rear, and
the best of them will never be heard of again after we publicly exhibit
in New York.</p>
<p>We shall put on 3 more cubs. We have one school boy and two
compositors, now,–and we think of putting on a type writer, a
stenographer, and perhaps a shoemaker, to show that no special gifts or
training are required with this machine. We shall train these beginners
two or three months–or until some one of them gets up to 7,000 an
hour–then we will show up in New York and run the machine 24 hours a day
7 days in the week, for several months–to prove that this is a machine
which will never get out of order or cause delay, and can stand anything
an anvil can stand. You know there is no other typesetting machine that
can run two hours on a stretch without causing trouble and delay with
its incurable caprices.</p>
<p>We own the whole field–every inch of it–and nothing can dislodge
us.</p>
<p>Now then, above is my preachment, and here follows the reason and
purpose of it. I want you to run over here, roost over the machine a
week and satisfy yourself, and then go to John P. Jones or to whom you
please, and sell me a hundred thousand dollars’ worth of this property
and take ten per cent in cash or the “property“ for your trouble–the
latter, if you are wise, because the price I ask is a long way short of
the value.</p>
<p>What I call “property“ is this. A small part of my ownership consists
of a royalty of 00 on every machine marketed under the American patents.
My selling-terms are, a permanent royalty of one dollar on every
American-marketed machine for a thousand dollars cash to me in hand
paid. We shan’t market any fewer than 5,000 machines in 15 years–a
return of fifteen thousand dollars for one thousand. A royalty is better
than stock, in one way–it must be paid, every six months, rain or shine;
it is a debt, and must be paid before dividends are declared. By and by,
when we become a stock company I shall buy these royalties back for
stock if I can get them for anything like reasonable terms.</p>
<p>I have never borrowed a penny to use on the machine, and never sold a
penny’s worth of the property until the machine was entirely finished
and proven by the severest tests to be what she started out to
be–perfect, permanent, and occupying the position, as regards all
kindred machines, which the City of Paris occupies as regards the
canvas-backs of the mercantile marine.</p>
<p>It is my purpose to sell two hundred dollars of my royalties at the
above price during the next two months and keep the other 00.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens begs Mrs. Goodman to come with you, and asks pardon for
not writing the message herself–which would be a pathetically-welcome
spectacle to me; for I have been her amanuensis for 8 months, now, since
her eyes failed her. Yours as always MARK.</p>
<p>While this letter with its amazing contents is on its way to astonish
Joe Goodman, we will consider one of quite a different, but equally
characteristic sort. We may assume that Mark Twain’s sister Pamela had
been visiting him in Hartford and was now making a visit in Keokuk.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Moffett, in Keokuk:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Oct 9, ’89. DEAR PAMELA,–An hour after you left I was
suddenly struck with a realizing sense of the utter chuckle-headedness
of that notion of mine: to send your trunk after you. Land! it was
idiotic. None but a lunatic would, separate himself from his
baggage.</p>
<p>Well, I am soulfully glad the baggage fetcher saved me from
consummating my insane inspiration. I met him on the street in the
afternoon and paid him again. I shall pay him several times more, as
opportunity offers.</p>
<p>I declined the invitation to banquet with the visiting South American
Congress, in a polite note explaining that I had to go to New York
today. I conveyed the note privately to Patrick; he got the envelope
soiled, and asked Livy to put on a clean one. That is why I am going to
the banquet; also why I have disinvited the boys I thought I was going
to punch billiards with, upstairs to-night.</p>
<p>Patrick is one of the injudiciousest people I ever struck. And I am
the other. Your Brother SAM.</p>
<p>The Yankee was now ready for publication, and advance sheets were
already in the reviewers’ hands. Just at this moment the Brazilian
monarchy crumbled, and Clemens was moved to write Sylvester Baxter, of
the Boston Herald, a letter which is of special interest in its prophecy
of the new day, the dawn of which was even nearer than he suspected.</p>
<p>DEAR MR. BAXTER, Another throne has gone down, and I swim in oceans
of satisfaction. I wish I might live fifty years longer; I believe I
should see the thrones of Europe selling at auction for old iron. I
believe I should really see the end of what is surely the grotesquest of
all the swindles ever invented by man-monarchy. It is enough to make a
graven image laugh, to see apparently rational people, away down here in
this wholesome and merciless slaughter-day for shams, still mouthing
empty reverence for those moss-backed frauds and scoundrelisms,
hereditary kingship and so-called “nobility.“ It is enough to make the
monarchs and nobles themselves laugh–and in private they do; there can
be no question about that. I think there is only one funnier thing, and
that is the spectacle of these bastard Americans–these Hamersleys and
Huntingtons and such–offering cash, encumbered by themselves, for rotten
carcases and stolen titles. When our great brethren the disenslaved
Brazilians frame their Declaration of Independence, I hope they will
insert this missing link: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that
all monarchs are usurpers, and descendants of usurpers; for the reason
that no throne was ever set up in this world by the will, freely
exercised, of the only body possessing the legitimate right to set it
up–the numerical mass of the nation.“</p>
<p>You already have the advance sheets of my forthcoming book in your
hands. If you will turn to about the five hundredth page, you will find
a state paper of my Connecticut Yankee in which he announces the
dissolution of King Arthur’s monarchy and proclaims the English
Republic. Compare it with the state paper which announces the downfall
of the Brazilian monarchy and proclaims the Republic of the United
States of Brazil, and stand by to defend the Yankee from plagiarism.
There is merely a resemblance of ideas, nothing more. The Yankee’s
proclamation was already in print a week ago. This is merely one of
those odd coincidences which are always turning up. Come, protect the
Yank from that cheapest and easiest of all charges–plagiarism.
Otherwise, you see, he will have to protect himself by charging
approximate and indefinite plagiarism upon the official servants of our
majestic twin down yonder, and then there might be war, or some similar
annoyance.</p>
<p>Have you noticed the rumor that the Portuguese throne is unsteady,
and that the Portuguese slaves are getting restive? Also, that the head
slave-driver of Europe, Alexander III, has so reduced his usual monthly
order for chains that the Russian foundries are running on only half
time now? Also that other rumor that English nobility acquired an added
stench the other day–and had to ship it to India and the continent
because there wasn’t any more room for it at home? Things are working.
By and by there is going to be an emigration, may be. Of course we shall
make no preparation; we never do. In a few years from now we shall have
nothing but played-out kings and dukes on the police, and driving the
horse-cars, and whitewashing fences, and in fact overcrowding all the
avenues of unskilled labor; and then we shall wish, when it is too late,
that we had taken common and reasonable precautions and drowned them at
Castle Garden.</p>
<p>There followed at this time a number of letters to Goodman, but as
there is much of a sameness in them, we need not print them all.
Clemens, in fact, kept the mails warm with letters bulging with schemes
for capitalization, and promising vast wealth to all concerned. When the
letters did not go fast enough he sent telegrams. In one of the letters
Goodman is promised “five hundred thousand dollars out of the profits
before we get anything ourselves.“ One thing we gather from these
letters is that Paige has taken the machine apart again, never satisfied
with its perfection, or perhaps getting a hint that certain of its
perfections were not permanent. A letter at the end of November seems
worth preserving here.</p>
<p>To Joseph T. Goodman, in California:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Nov. 29, ’89. DEAR JOE, Things are getting into better and
more flexible shape every day. Papers are now being drawn which will
greatly simplify the raising of capital; I shall be in supreme command;
it will not be necessary for the capitalist to arrive at terms with
anybody but me. I don’t want to dicker with anybody but Jones. I know
him; that is to say, I want to dicker with you, and through you with
Jones. Try to see if you can’t be here by the 15th of January.</p>
<p>The machine was as perfect as a watch when we took her apart the
other day; but when she goes together again the 15th of January we
expect her to be perfecter than a watch.</p>
<p>Joe, I want you to sell some royalties to the boys out there, if you
can, for I want to be financially strong when we go to New York. You
know the machine, and you appreciate its future enormous career better
than any man I know. At the lowest conceivable estimate (2,000 machines
a year,) we shall sell 34,000 in the life of the patent–17 years.</p>
<p>All the family send love to you–and they mean it, or they wouldn’t
say it. Yours ever MARK.</p>
<p>The Yankee had come from the press, and Howells had praised it in the
“Editor’s Study“ in Harper’s Magazine. He had given it his highest
commendation, and it seems that his opinion of it did not change with
time. “Of all fanciful schemes of fiction it pleases me most,“ he in one
place declared, and again referred to it as “a greatly imagined and
symmetrically developed tale.“</p>
<p>In more than one letter to Goodman, Clemens had urged him to come
East without delay. “Take the train, Joe, and come along,“ he wrote
early in December. And we judge from the following that Joe had decided
to come.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Dec. 23, ’89. DEAR HOWELLS,–The magazine came last night,
and the Study notice is just great. The satisfaction it affords us could
not be more prodigious if the book deserved every word of it; and maybe
it does; I hope it does, though of course I can’t realize it and believe
it. But I am your grateful servant, anyway and always.</p>
<p>I am going to read to the Cadets at West Point Jan. 11. I go from
here to New York the 9th, and up to the Point the 11th. Can’t you go
with me? It’s great fun. I’m going to read the passages in the “Yankee“
in which the Yankee’s West Point cadets figure–and shall covertly work
in a lecture on aristocracy to those boys. I am to be the guest of the
Superintendent, but if you will go I will shake him and we will go to
the hotel. He is a splendid fellow, and I know him well enough to take
that liberty.</p>
<p>And won’t you give me a day or two’s visit toward the end of January?
For two reasons: the machine will be at work again by that time, and we
want to hear the rest of the dream-story; Mrs. Clemens keeps speaking
about it and hankering for it. And we can have Joe Goodman on hand again
by that time, and I want you to get to know him thoroughly. It’s well
worth it. I am going to run up and stay over night with you as soon as I
can get a chance.</p>
<p>We are in the full rush of the holidays now, and an awful rush it is,
too. You ought to have been here the other day, to make that day perfect
and complete. All alone I managed to inflict agonies on Mrs: Clemens,
whereas I was expecting nothing but praises. I made a party call the day
after the party–and called the lady down from breakfast to receive it. I
then left there and called on a new bride, who received me in her
dressing-gown; and as things went pretty well, I stayed to luncheon. The
error here was, that the appointed reception-hour was 3 in the
afternoon, and not at the bride’s house but at her aunt’s in another
part of the town. However, as I meant well, none of these disasters
distressed me. Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>The Yankee did not find a very hearty welcome in England. English
readers did not fancy any burlesque of their Arthurian tales, or
American strictures on their institutions. Mark Twain’s publishers had
feared this, and asked that the story be especially edited for the
English edition. Clemens, however, would not listen to any suggestions
of the sort.</p>
<p>To Messrs. Chatto andandandand Windus, in London, Eng.:</p>
<p>GENTLEMEN,–Concerning The Yankee, I have already revised the story
twice; and it has been read critically by W. D. Howells and Edmund
Clarence Stedman, and my wife has caused me to strike out several
passages that have been brought to her attention, and to soften others.
Furthermore, I have read chapters of the book in public where Englishmen
were present and have profited by their suggestions.</p>
<p>Now, mind you, I have taken all this pains because I wanted to say a
Yankee mechanic’s say against monarchy and its several natural props,
and yet make a book which you would be willing to print exactly as it
comes to you, without altering a word.</p>
<p>We are spoken of (by Englishmen) as a thin-skinned people. It is you
who are thin-skinned. An Englishman may write with the most brutal
frankness about any man or institution among us and we republish him
without dreaming of altering a line or a word. But England cannot stand
that kind of a book written about herself. It is England that is
thin-skinned. It causeth me to smile when I read the modifications of my
language which have been made in my English editions to fit them for the
sensitive English palate.</p>
<p>Now, as I say, I have taken laborious pains to so trim this book of
offense that you might not lack the nerve to print it just as it stands.
I am going to get the proofs to you just as early as I can. I want you
to read it carefully. If you can publish it without altering a single
word, go ahead. Otherwise, please hand it to J. R. Osgood in time for
him to have it published at my expense.</p>
<p>This is important, for the reason that the book was not written for
America; it was written for England. So many Englishmen have done their
sincerest best to teach us something for our betterment that it seems to
me high time that some of us should substantially recognize the good
intent by trying to pry up the English nation to a little higher level
of manhood in turn. Very truly yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The English nation, at least a considerable portion of it, did not
wish to be “pried up to a higher level of manhood“ by a Connecticut
Yankee. The papers pretty generally denounced the book as coarse; in
fact, a vulgar travesty. Some of the critics concluded that England,
after all, had made a mistake in admiring Mark Twain. Clemens stood this
for a time and then seems to have decided that something should be done.
One of the foremost of English critics was his friend and admirer; he
would state the case to him fully and invite his assistance.</p>
<p>To Andrew Lang, in London:</p>
<p>[First page missing.]</p>
<p>1889 They vote but do not print. The head tells you pretty promptly
whether the food is satisfactory or not; and everybody hears, and thinks
the whole man has spoken. It is a delusion. Only his taste and his smell
have been heard from–important, both, in a way, but these do not build
up the man; and preserve his life and fortify it.</p>
<p>The little child is permitted to label its drawings “This is a cow
this is a horse,“ and so on. This protects the child. It saves it from
the sorrow and wrong of hearing its cows and its horses criticized as
kangaroos and work benches. A man who is white-washing a fence is doing
a useful thing, so also is the man who is adorning a rich man’s house
with costly frescoes; and all of us are sane enough to judge these
performances by standards proper to each. Now, then, to be fair, an
author ought to be allowed to put upon his book an explanatory line:
“This is written for the Head;“ “This is written for the Belly and the
Members.“ And the critic ought to hold himself in honor bound to put
away from him his ancient habit of judging all books by one standard,
and thenceforth follow a fairer course.</p>
<p>The critic assumes, every time, that if a book doesn’t meet the
cultivated-class standard, it isn’t valuable. Let us apply his law all
around: for if it is sound in the case of novels, narratives, pictures,
and such things, it is certainly sound and applicable to all the steps
which lead up to culture and make culture possible. It condemns the
spelling book, for a spelling book is of no use to a person of culture;
it condemns all school books and all schools which lie between the
child’s primer and Greek, and between the infant school and the
university; it condemns all the rounds of art which lie between the
cheap terra cotta groups and the Venus de Medici, and between the chromo
and the Transfiguration; it requires Whitcomb Riley to sing no more till
he can sing like Shakespeare, and it forbids all amateur music and will
grant its sanction to nothing below the “classic.“</p>
<p>Is this an extravagant statement? No, it is a mere statement of fact.
It is the fact itself that is extravagant and grotesque. And what is the
result? This–and it is sufficiently curious: the critic has actually
imposed upon the world the superstition that a painting by Raphael is
more valuable to the civilizations of the earth than is a chromo; and
the august opera than the hurdy-gurdy and the villagers’ singing
society; and Homer than the little everybody’s-poet whose rhymes are in
all mouths today and will be in nobody’s mouth next generation; and the
Latin classics than Kipling’s far-reaching bugle-note; and Jonathan
Edwards than the Salvation Army; and the Venus de Medici than the
plaster-cast peddler; the superstition, in a word, that the vast and
awful comet that trails its cold lustre through the remote abysses of
space once a century and interests and instructs a cultivated handful of
astronomers is worth more to the world than the sun which warms and
cheers all the nations every day and makes the crops to grow.</p>
<p>If a critic should start a religion it would not have any object but
to convert angels: and they wouldn’t need it. The thin top crust of
humanity–the cultivated–are worth pacifying, worth pleasing, worth
coddling, worth nourishing and preserving with dainties and delicacies,
it is true; but to be caterer to that little faction is no very
dignified or valuable occupation, it seems to me; it is merely feeding
the over-fed, and there must be small satisfaction in that. It is not
that little minority who are already saved that are best worth trying to
uplift, I should think, but the mighty mass of the uncultivated who are
underneath. That mass will never see the Old Masters–that sight is for
the few; but the chromo maker can lift them all one step upward toward
appreciation of art; they cannot have the opera, but the hurdy-gurdy and
the singing class lift them a little way toward that far light; they
will never know Homer, but the passing rhymester of their day leaves
them higher than he found them; they may never even hear of the Latin
classics, but they will strike step with Kipling’s drum-beat, and they
will march; for all Jonathan Edwards’s help they would die in their
slums, but the Salvation Army will beguile some of them up to pure air
and a cleaner life; they know no sculpture, the Venus is not even a name
to them, but they are a grade higher in the scale of civilization by the
ministrations of the plaster-cast than they were before it took its
place upon then mantel and made it beautiful to their unexacting
eyes.</p>
<p>Indeed I have been misjudged, from the very first. I have never tried
in even one single instance, to help cultivate the cultivated classes. I
was not equipped for it, either by native gifts or training. And I never
had any ambition in that direction, but always hunted for bigger
game–the masses. I have seldom deliberately tried to instruct them, but
have done my best to entertain them. To simply amuse them would have
satisfied my dearest ambition at any time; for they could get
instruction elsewhere, and I had two chances to help to the teacher’s
one: for amusement is a good preparation for study and a good healer of
fatigue after it. My audience is dumb, it has no voice in print, and so
I cannot know whether I have won its approbation or only got its
censure.</p>
<p>Yes, you see, I have always catered for the Belly and the Members,
but have been served like the others–criticized from the
culture-standard –to my sorrow and pain; because, honestly, I never
cared what became of the cultured classes; they could go to the theatre
and the opera–they had no use for me and the melodeon.</p>
<p>And now at last I arrive at my object and tender my petition, making
supplication to this effect: that the critics adopt a rule recognizing
the Belly and the Members, and formulate a standard whereby work done
for them shall be judged. Help me, Mr. Lang; no voice can reach further
than yours in a case of this kind, or carry greater weight of
authority.</p>
<p>Lang’s reply was an article in the Illustrated London News on “The
Art of Mark Twain.“ Lang had no admiration to express for the Yankee,
which he confessed he had not cared to read, but he glorified Huck Finn
to the highest. “I can never forget, nor be ungrateful for the exquisite
pleasure with which I read Huckleberry Finn for the first time, years
ago,“ he wrote; “I read it again last night, deserting Kenilworth for
Huck. I never laid it down till I had finished it.“</p>
<p>Lang closed his article by referring to the story of Huck as the
“great American novel which had escaped the eyes of those who watched to
see this new planet swim into their ken.“</p>
