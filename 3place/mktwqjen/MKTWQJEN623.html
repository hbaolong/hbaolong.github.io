<h4 id="chapter-17-sweet-fruit-of-bitter-truth">CHAPTER 17 Sweet Fruit
of Bitter Truth</h4>
<p>WHEN WE got home, breakfast for us minor fry was waiting in our
mess-room and the family honored us by coming in to eat it with us. The
nice old treasurer, and in fact all three were flatteringly eager to
hear about our adventures. Nobody asked the Paladin to begin, but he did
begin, because now that his specially ordained and peculiar military
rank set him above everybody on the personal staff but old D’Aulon, who
didn’t eat with us, he didn’t care a farthing for the knights’ nobility
no mine, but took precedence in the talk whenever it suited him, which
was all the time, because he was born that way. He said:</p>
<p>“God be thanked, we found the army in admirable condition I think I
have never seen a finer body of animals.“</p>
<p>“Animals!“ said Miss Catherine.</p>
<p>“I will explain to you what he means,“ said Noel. “He–“</p>
<p>“I will trouble you not to trouble yourself to explain anything for
me,“ said the Paladin, loftily. “I have reason to think–“</p>
<p>“That is his way,“ said Noel; “always when he thinks he has reason to
think, he thinks he does think, but this is an error. He didn’t see the
army. I noticed him, and he didn’t see it. He was troubled by his old
complaint.“</p>
<p>“What s his old complaint?“ Catherine asked.</p>
<p>“Prudence,“ I said, seeing my chance to help.</p>
<p>But it was not a fortunate remark, for the Paladin said:</p>
<p>“It probably isn’t your turn to criticize people’s prudence–you who
fall out of the saddle when a donkey brays.“</p>
<p>They all laughed, and I was ashamed of myself for my hasty smartness.
I said:</p>
<p>“It isn’t quite fair for you to say I fell out on account of the
donkey’s braying. It was emotion, just ordinary emotion.“</p>
<p>“Very well, if you want to call it that, I am not objecting. What
would you call it, Sir Bertrand?“</p>
<p>“Well, it–well, whatever it was, it was excusable, I think. All of
you have learned how to behave in hot hand-to-hand engagements, and you
don’t need to be ashamed of your record in that matter; but to walk
along in front of death, with one’s hands idle, and no noise, no music,
and nothing going on, is a very trying situation. If I were you, De
Conte, I would name the emotion; it’s nothing to be ashamed of.“</p>
<p>It was as straight and sensible a speech as ever I heard, and I was
grateful for the opening it gave me; so I came out and said:</p>
<p>“It was fear–and thank you for the honest idea, too.“</p>
<p>“It was the cleanest and best way out,“ said the old treasurer;
“you’ve done well, my lad.“</p>
<p>That made me comfortable, and when Miss Catherine said, “It’s what I
think, too,“ I was grateful to myself for getting into that scrape.</p>
<p>Sir Jean de Metz said:</p>
<p>“We were all in a body together when the donkey brayed, and it was
dismally still at the time. I don’t see how any young campaigner could
escape some little touch of that emotion.“</p>
<p>He looked about him with a pleasant expression of inquiry on his good
face, and as each pair of eyes in turn met his head they were in nodded
a confession. Even the Paladin delivered his nod. That surprised
everybody, and saved the Standard-Bearer’s credit. It was clever of him;
nobody believed he could tell the truth that way without practice, or
would tell that particular sort of a truth either with or without
practice. I suppose he judged it would favorably impress the family.
Then the old treasurer said:</p>
<p>“Passing the forts in that trying way required the same sort of nerve
that a person must have when ghosts are about him in the dark, I should
think. What does the Standard-Bearer think?“</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t quite know about that, sir. I’ve often thought I would
like to see a ghost if I–“</p>
<p>“Would you?“ exclaimed the young lady. “We’ve got one! Would you try
that one? Will you?“</p>
<p>She was so eager and pretty that the Paladin said straight out that
he would; and then as none of the rest had bravery enough to expose the
fear that was in him, one volunteered after the other with a prompt
mouth and a sick heart till all were shipped for the voyage; then the
girl clapped her hands in glee, and the parents were gratified, too,
saying that the ghosts of their house had been a dread and a misery to
them and their forebears for generations, and nobody had ever been found
yet who was willing to confront them and find out what their trouble
was, so that the family could heal it and content the poor specters and
beguile them to tranquillity and peace.</p>
