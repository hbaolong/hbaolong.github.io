1879. RETURN TO AMERICA. THE GREAT GRANT REUNION</h4>
<p>Life went on very well in Munich. Each day the family fell more in
love with Fraulein Dahlweiner and her house.</p>
<p>Mark Twain, however, did not settle down to his work readily. His
“pleasant work-room“ provided exercise, but no inspiration. When he
discovered he could not find his Swiss note-book he was ready to give up
his travel-writing altogether. In the letter that follows we find him
much less enthusiastic concerning his own performances than over the
story by Howells, which he was following in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>The “detective“ chapter mentioned in this letter was not included in
‘A Tramp Abroad.’ It was published separately, as ‘The Stolen White
Elephant’ in a volume bearing that title. The play, which he had now
found “dreadfully witless and flat,“ was no other than “Simon Wheeler,
Detective,“ which he had once regarded so highly. The “Stewart“ referred
to was the millionaire merchant, A. T. Stewart, whose body was stolen in
the expectation of reward.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>MUNICH, Jan. 21, (1879) MY DEAR HOWELLS,–It’s no use, your letter
miscarried in some way and is lost. The consul has made a thorough
search and says he has not been able to trace it. It is unaccountable,
for all the letters I did not want arrived without a single grateful
failure. Well, I have read-up, now, as far as you have got, that is, to
where there’s a storm at sea approaching,–and we three think you are
clear, out-Howellsing Howells. If your literature has not struck
perfection now we are not able to see what is lacking. It is all such
truth–truth to the life; every where your pen falls it leaves a
photograph. I did imagine that everything had been said about life at
sea that could be said, but no matter, it was all a failure and lies,
nothing but lies with a thin varnish of fact,–only you have stated it as
it absolutely is. And only you see people and their ways, and their
insides and outsides as they are, and make them talk as they do talk. I
think you are the very greatest artist in these tremendous mysteries
that ever lived. There doesn’t seem to be anything that can be concealed
from your awful all-seeing eye. It must be a cheerful thing for one to
live with you and be aware that you are going up and down in him like
another conscience all the time. Possibly you will not be a fully
accepted classic until you have been dead a hundred years,–it is the
fate of the Shakespeares and of all genuine prophets, –but then your
books will be as common as Bibles, I believe. You’re not a weed, but an
oak; not a summer-house, but a cathedral. In that day I shall still be
in the Cyclopedias, too, thus: “Mark Twain; history and occupation
unknown–but he was personally acquainted with Howells.“ There–I could
sing your praises all day, and feel and believe every bit of it.</p>
<p>My book is half finished; I wish to heaven it was done. I have given
up writing a detective novel–can’t write a novel, for I lack the
faculty; but when the detectives were nosing around after Stewart’s loud
remains, I threw a chapter into my present book in which I have very
extravagantly burlesqued the detective business–if it is possible to
burlesque that business extravagantly. You know I was going to send you
that detective play, so that you could re-write it. Well I didn’t do it
because I couldn’t find a single idea in it that could be useful to you.
It was dreadfully witless and flat. I knew it would sadden you and unfit
you for work.</p>
<p>I have always been sorry we threw up that play embodying Orion which
you began. It was a mistake to do that. Do keep that MS and tackle it
again. It will work out all right; you will see. I don’t believe that
that character exists in literature in so well-developed a condition as
it exists in Orion’s person. Now won’t you put Orion in a story? Then he
will go handsomely into a play afterwards. How deliciously you could
paint him–it would make fascinating reading–the sort that makes a reader
laugh and cry at the same time, for Orion is as good and ridiculous a
soul as ever was.</p>
<p>Ah, to think of Bayard Taylor! It is too sad to talk about. I was so
glad there was not a single sting and so many good praiseful words in
the Atlantic’s criticism of Deukalion. Love to you all Yrs Ever MARK</p>
<p>We remain here till middle of March.</p>
<p>In ‘A Tramp Abroad’ there is an incident in which the author
describes himself as hunting for a lost sock in the dark, in a vast
hotel bedroom at Heilbronn. The account of the real incident, as written
to Twichell, seems even more amusing.</p>
<p>The “Yarn About the Limburger Cheese and the Box of Guns,“ like “The
Stolen White Elephant,“ did not find place in the travel-book, but was
published in the same volume with the elephant story, added to the
rambling notes of “An Idle Excursion.“</p>
<p>With the discovery of the Swiss note-book, work with Mark Twain was
going better. His letter reflects his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>MUNICH, Jan 26 ’79. DEAR OLD JOE,–Sunday. Your delicious letter
arrived exactly at the right time. It was laid by my plate as I was
finishing breakfast at 12 noon. Livy and Clara, (Spaulding) arrived from
church 5 minutes later; I took a pipe and spread myself out on the sofa,
and Livy sat by and read, and I warmed to that butcher the moment he
began to swear. There is more than one way of praying, and I like the
butcher’s way because the petitioner is so apt to be in earnest. I was
peculiarly alive to his performance just at this time, for another
reason, to wit: Last night I awoke at 3 this morning, and after raging
to my self for 2 interminable hours, I gave it up. I rose, assumed a
catlike stealthiness, to keep from waking Livy, and proceeded to dress
in the pitch dark. Slowly but surely I got on garment after garment–all
down to one sock; I had one slipper on and the other in my hand. Well,
on my hands and knees I crept softly around, pawing and feeling and
scooping along the carpet, and among chair-legs for that missing sock; I
kept that up; and still kept it up and kept it up. At first I only said
to myself, “Blame that sock,“ but that soon ceased to answer; my
expletives grew steadily stronger and stronger,–and at last, when I
found I was lost, I had to sit flat down on the floor and take hold of
something to keep from lifting the roof off with the profane explosion
that was trying to get out of me. I could see the dim blur of the
window, but of course it was in the wrong place and could give me no
information as to where I was. But I had one comfort –I had not waked
Livy; I believed I could find that sock in silence if the night lasted
long enough. So I started again and softly pawed all over the place,–and
sure enough at the end of half an hour I laid my hand on the missing
article. I rose joyfully up and butted the wash-bowl and pitcher off the
stand and simply raised—-so to speak. Livy screamed, then said, “Who is
that? what is the matter?“ I said “There ain’t anything the matter–I’m
hunting for my sock.“ She said, “Are you hunting for it with a
club?“</p>
<p>I went in the parlor and lit the lamp, and gradually the fury
subsided and the ridiculous features of the thing began to suggest
themselves. So I lay on the sofa, with note-book and pencil, and
transferred the adventure to our big room in the hotel at Heilbronn, and
got it on paper a good deal to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>I found the Swiss note-book, some time ago. When it was first lost I
was glad of it, for I was getting an idea that I had lost my faculty of
writing sketches of travel; therefore the loss of that note-book would
render the writing of this one simply impossible, and let me gracefully
out; I was about to write to Bliss and propose some other book, when the
confounded thing turned up, and down went my heart into my boots. But
there was now no excuse, so I went solidly to work–tore up a great part
of the MS written in Heidelberg,–wrote and tore up,–continued to write
and tear up,–and at last, reward of patient and noble persistence, my
pen got the old swing again!</p>
<p>Since then I’m glad Providence knew better what to do with the Swiss
note-book than I did, for I like my work, now, exceedingly, and often
turn out over 30 MS pages a day and then quit sorry that Heaven makes
the days so short.</p>
<p>One of my discouragements had been the belief that my interest in
this tour had been so slender that I couldn’t gouge matter enough out of
it to make a book. What a mistake. I’ve got 900 pages written (not a
word in it about the sea voyage) yet I stepped my foot out of Heidelberg
for the first time yesterday,–and then only to take our party of four on
our first pedestrian tour–to Heilbronn. I’ve got them dressed
elaborately in walking costume–knapsacks, canteens, field-glasses,
leather leggings, patent walking shoes, muslin folds around their hats,
with long tails hanging down behind, sun umbrellas, and Alpenstocks.
They go all the way to Wimpfen by rail-thence to Heilbronn in a chance
vegetable cart drawn by a donkey and a cow; I shall fetch them home on a
raft; and if other people shall perceive that that was no pedestrian
excursion, they themselves shall not be conscious of it.–This trip will
take 100 pages or more,–oh, goodness knows how many! for the mood is
everything, not the material, and I already seem to see 300 pages rising
before me on that trip. Then, I propose to leave Heidelberg for good.
Don’t you see, the book (1800 MS pages,) may really be finished before I
ever get to Switzerland?</p>
<p>But there’s one thing; I want to tell Frank Bliss and his father to
be charitable toward me in,–that is, let me tear up all the MS I want
to, and give me time to write more. I shan’t waste the time–I haven’t
the slightest desire to loaf, but a consuming desire to work, ever since
I got back my swing. And you see this book is either going to be
compared with the Innocents Abroad, or contrasted with it, to my
disadvantage. I think I can make a book that will be no dead corpse of a
thing and I mean to do my level best to accomplish that.</p>
<p>My crude plans are crystalizing. As the thing stands now, I went to
Europe for three purposes. The first you know, and must keep secret,
even from the Blisses; the second is to study Art; and the third to
acquire a critical knowledge of the German language. My MS already shows
that the two latter objects are accomplished. It shows that I am moving
about as an Artist and a Philologist, and unaware that there is any
immodesty in assuming these titles. Having three definite objects has
had the effect of seeming to enlarge my domain and give me the freedom
of a loose costume. It is three strings to my bow, too.</p>
<p>Well, your butcher is magnificent. He won’t stay out of my mind.–I
keep trying to think of some way of getting your account of him into my
book without his being offended–and yet confound him there isn’t
anything you have said which he would see any offense in,–I’m only
thinking of his friends–they are the parties who busy themselves with
seeing things for people. But I’m bound to have him in. I’m putting in
the yarn about the Limburger cheese and the box of guns, too–mighty glad
Howells declined it. It seems to gather richness and flavor with age. I
have very nearly killed several companies with that narrative,–the
American Artists Club, here, for instance, and Smith and wife and Miss
Griffith (they were here in this house a week or two.) I’ve got other
chapters that pretty nearly destroyed the same parties, too.</p>
<p>O, Switzerland! the further it recedes into the enriching haze of
time, the more intolerably delicious the charm of it and the cheer of it
and the glory and majesty and solemnity and pathos of it grow. Those
mountains had a soul; they thought; they spoke,–one couldn’t hear it
with the ears of the body, but what a voice it was!–and how real. Deep
down in my memory it is sounding yet. Alp calleth unto Alp!–that stately
old Scriptural wording is the right one for God’s Alps and God’s ocean.
How puny we were in that awful presence–and how painless it was to be
so; how fitting and right it seemed, and how stingless was the sense of
our unspeakable insignificance. And Lord how pervading were the repose
and peace and blessedness that poured out of the heart of the invisible
Great Spirit of the Mountains.</p>
<p>Now what is it? There are mountains and mountains and mountains in
this world–but only these take you by the heart-strings. I wonder what
the secret of it is. Well, time and time again it has seemed to me that
I must drop everything and flee to Switzerland once more. It is a
longing –a deep, strong, tugging longing–that is the word. We must go
again, Joe.–October days, let us get up at dawn and breakfast at the
tower. I should like that first rate.</p>
<p>Livy and all of us send deluges of love to you and Harmony and all
the children. I dreamed last night that I woke up in the library at home
and your children were frolicing around me and Julia was sitting in my
lap; you and Harmony and both families of Warners had finished their
welcomes and were filing out through the conservatory door, wrecking
Patrick’s flower pots with their dress skirts as they went. Peace and
plenty abide with you all! MARK.</p>
<p>I want the Blisses to know their part of this letter, if possible.
They will see that my delay was not from choice.</p>
<p>Following the life of Mark Twain, whether through his letters or
along the sequence of detailed occurrence, we are never more than a
little while, or a little distance, from his brother Orion. In one form
or another Orion is ever present, his inquiries, his proposals, his
suggestions, his plans for improving his own fortunes, command our
attention. He was one of the most human creatures that ever lived;
indeed, his humanity excluded every form of artificiality –everything
that needs to be acquired. Talented, trusting, child-like, carried away
by the impulse of the moment, despite a keen sense of humor he was never
able to see that his latest plan or project was not bound to succeed.
Mark Twain loved him, pitied him–also enjoyed him, especially with
Howells. Orion’s new plan to lecture in the interest of religion found
its way to Munich, with the following result:</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>MUNICH, Feb. 9. (1879) MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I have just received this
letter from Orion–take care of it, for it is worth preserving. I got as
far as 9 pages in my answer to it, when Mrs. Clemens shut down on it,
and said it was cruel, and made me send the money and simply wish his
lecture success. I said I couldn’t lose my 9 pages–so she said send them
to you. But I will acknowledge that I thought I was writing a very kind
letter.</p>
<p>Now just look at this letter of Orion’s. Did you ever see the
grotesquely absurd and the heart-breakingly pathetic more closely joined
together? Mrs. Clemens said “Raise his monthly pension.“ So I wrote to
Perkins to raise it a trifle.</p>
<p>Now only think of it! He still has 100 pages to write on his lecture,
yet in one inking of his pen he has already swooped around the United
States and invested the result!</p>
<p>You must put him in a book or a play right away. You are the only man
capable of doing it. You might die at any moment, and your very greatest
work would be lost to the world. I could write Orion’s simple biography,
and make it effective, too, by merely stating the bald facts–and this I
will do if he dies before I do; but you must put him into romance. This
was the understanding you and I had the day I sailed.</p>
<p>Observe Orion’s career–that is, a little of it: (1) He has belonged
to as many as five different religious denominations; last March he
withdrew from the deaconship in a Congregational Church and the
Superintendency of its Sunday School, in a speech in which he said that
for many months (it runs in my mind that he said 13 years,) he had been
a confirmed infidel, and so felt it to be his duty to retire from the
flock.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>After being a republican for years, he wanted me to buy him a
democratic newspaper. A few days before the Presidential election, he
came out in a speech and publicly went over to the democrats; he
prudently “hedged“ by voting for 6 state republicans, also.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new convert was made one of the secretaries of the democratic
meeting, and placed in the list of speakers. He wrote me jubilantly of
what a ten-strike he was going to make with that speech. All right–but
think of his innocent and pathetic candor in writing me something like
this, a week later:</p>
<p>“I was more diffident than I had expected to be, and this was
increased by the silence with which I was received when I came forward;
so I seemed unable to get the fire into my speech which I had calculated
upon, and presently they began to get up and go out; and in a few
minutes they all rose up and went away.“</p>
<p>How could a man uncover such a sore as that and show it to another?
Not a word of complaint, you see–only a patient, sad surprise.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>His next project was to write a burlesque upon Paradise
Lost.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, learning that the Times was paying Harte 00 a column for
stories, he concluded to write some for the same price. I read his first
one and persuaded him not to write any more.</p></li>
<li><p>Then he read proof on the N. Y. Eve. Post at 0 a week and meekly
observed that the foreman swore at him and ordered him around “like a
steamboat mate.“</p></li>
<li><p>Being discharged from that post, he wanted to try agriculture–was
sure he could make a fortune out of a chicken farm. I gave him 00 and he
went to a ten-house village a miles above Keokuk on the river bank –this
place was a railway station. He soon asked for money to buy a horse and
light wagon,–because the trains did not run at church time on Sunday and
his wife found it rather far to walk.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For a long time I answered demands for “loans“ and by next mail
always received his check for the interest due me to date. In the most
guileless way he let it leak out that he did not underestimate the value
of his custom to me, since it was not likely that any other customer of
mine paid his interest quarterly, and this enabled me to use my capital
twice in 6 months instead of only once. But alas, when the debt at last
reached 800 or 500 (I have forgotten which) the interest ate too
formidably into his borrowings, and so he quietly ceased to pay it or
speak of it. At the end of two years I found that the chicken farm had
long ago been abandoned, and he had moved into Keokuk. Later in one of
his casual moments, he observed that there was no money in fattening a
chicken on 65 cents worth of corn and then selling it for 50.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Finally, if I would lend him 00 a year for two years, (this was 4
or 5 years ago,) he knew he could make a success as a lawyer, and would
prove it. This is the pension which we have just increased to 00. The
first year his legal business brought him . It also brought him an
unremunerative case where some villains were trying to chouse some negro
orphans out of 00. He still has this case. He has waggled it around
through various courts and made some booming speeches on it. The negro
children have grown up and married off, now, I believe, and their
litigated town-lot has been dug up and carted off by somebody–but Orion
still infests the courts with his documents and makes the welkin ring
with his venerable case. The second year, he didn’t make anything. The
third he made , and I made Bliss put a case in his hands–about half an
hour’s work. Orion charged 0 for it–Bliss paid him 5. Thus four or five
years of slaving has brought him 6, but this will doubtless be increased
when he gets done lecturing and buys that “law library.“ Meantime his
office rent has been 0 a year, and he has stuck to that lair day by day
as patiently as a spider.</p></li>
<li><p>Then he by and by conceived the idea of lecturing around America
as “Mark Twain’s Brother“–that to be on the bills. Subject of proposed
lecture, “On the, Formation of Character.“</p></li>
<li><p>I protested, and he got on his warpaint, couched his lance, and
ran a bold tilt against total abstinence and the Red Ribbon fanatics. It
raised a fine row among the virtuous Keokukians.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote to encourage him in his good work, but I had let a mail
intervene; so by the time my letter reached him he was already winning
laurels as a Red Ribbon Howler.</p></li>
<li><p>Afterward he took a rabid part in a prayer-meeting epidemic;
dropped that to travesty Jules Verne; dropped that, in the middle of the
last chapter, last March, to digest the matter of an infidel book which
he proposed to write; and now he comes to the surface to rescue our
“noble and beautiful religion“ from the sacrilegious talons of Bob
Ingersoll.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now come! Don’t fool away this treasure which Providence has laid at
your feet, but take it up and use it. One can let his imagination run
riot in portraying Orion, for there is nothing so extravagant as to be
out of character with him.</p>
<p>Well-good-bye, and a short life and a merry one be yours. Poor old
Methusaleh, how did he manage to stand it so long? Yrs ever, MARK.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens (Unsent and inclosed with the foregoing, to W. D.
Howells):</p>
<p>MUNICH, Feb. 9, (1879) MY DEAR BRO.,–Yours has just arrived. I
enclose a draft on Hartford for 5. You will have abandoned the project
you wanted it for, by the time it arrives,–but no matter, apply it to
your newer and present project, whatever it is. You see I have an
ineradicable faith in your unsteadfastness,–but mind you, I didn’t
invent that faith, you conferred it on me yourself. But fire away, fire
away! I don’t see why a changeable man shouldn’t get as much enjoyment
out of his changes, and transformations and transfigurations as a
steadfast man gets out of standing still and pegging at the same old
monotonous thing all the time. That is to say, I don’t see why a
kaleidoscope shouldn’t enjoy itself as much as a telescope, nor a
grindstone have as good a time as a whetstone, nor a barometer as good a
time as a yardstick. I don’t feel like girding at you any more about
fickleness of purpose, because I recognize and realize at last that it
is incurable; but before I learned to accept this truth, each new weekly
project of yours possessed the power of throwing me into the most
exhausting and helpless convulsions of profanity. But fire away, now!
Your magic has lost its might. I am able to view your inspirations
dispassionately and judicially, now, and say “This one or that one or
the other one is not up to your average flight, or is above it, or below
it.“</p>
<p>And so, without passion, or prejudice, or bias of any kind, I sit in
judgment upon your lecture project, and say it was up to your average,
it was indeed above it, for it had possibilities in it, and even
practical ones. While I was not sorry you abandoned it, I should not be
sorry if you had stuck to it and given it a trial. But on the whole you
did the wise thing to lay it aside, I think, because a lecture is a most
easy thing to fail in; and at your time of life, and in your own town,
such a failure would make a deep and cruel wound in your heart and in
your pride. It was decidedly unwise in you to think for a moment of
coming before a community who knew you, with such a course of lectures;
because Keokuk is not unaware that you have been a Swedenborgian, a
Presbyterian, a Congregationalist, and a Methodist (on probation), and
that just a year ago you were an infidel. If Keokuk had gone to your
lecture course, it would have gone to be amused, not instructed, for
when a man is known to have no settled convictions of his own he can’t
convince other people. They would have gone to be amused and that would
have been a deep humiliation to you. It could have been safe for you to
appear only where you were unknown–then many of your hearers would think
you were in earnest. And they would be right. You are in earnest while
your convictions are new. But taking it by and large, you probably did
best to discard that project altogether. But I leave you to judge of
that, for you are the worst judge I know of.</p>
<p>(Unfinished.)</p>
<p>That Mark Twain in many ways was hardly less child-like than his
brother is now and again revealed in his letters. He was of steadfast
purpose, and he possessed the driving power which Orion Clemens lacked;
but the importance to him of some of the smaller matters of life, as
shown in a letter like the following, bespeaks a certain simplicity of
nature which he never outgrew:</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>MUNICH, Feb. 24. (1879) DEAR OLD JOE,–It was a mighty good letter,
Joe–and that idea of yours is a rattling good one. But I have not sot
down here to answer your letter,–for it is down at my study,–but only to
impart some information.</p>
<p>For a months I had not shaved without crying. I’d spend 3/4 of an
hour whetting away on my hand–no use, couldn’t get an edge. Tried a
razor strop-same result. So I sat down and put in an hour thinking out
the mystery. Then it seemed plain–to wit: my hand can’t give a razor an
edge, it can only smooth and refine an edge that has already been given.
I judge that a razor fresh from the hone is this shape V–the long point
being the continuation of the edge–and that after much use the shape is
this V–the attenuated edge all worn off and gone. By George I knew that
was the explanation. And I knew that a freshly honed and freshly
strapped razor won’t cut, but after strapping on the hand as a final
operation, it will cut.–So I sent out for an oil-stone; none to be had,
but messenger brought back a little piece of rock the size of a
Safety-match box–(it was bought in a shoemaker’s shop) bad flaw in
middle of it, too, but I put 4 drops of fine Olive oil on it, picked out
the razor marked “Thursday“ because it was never any account and would
be no loss if I spoiled it–gave it a brisk and reckless honing for 10
minutes, then tried it on a hair–it wouldn’t cut. Then I trotted it
through a vigorous 20-minute course on a razor-strap and tried it on a
hair-it wouldn’t cut–tried it on my face–it made me cry–gave it a
5-minute stropping on my hand, and my land, what an edge she had! We
thought we knew what sharp razors were when we were tramping in
Switzerland, but it was a mistake–they were dull beside this old
Thursday razor of mine–which I mean to name Thursday October Christian,
in gratitude. I took my whetstone, and in 20 minutes I put two more of
my razors in splendid condition–but I leave them in the box–I never use
any but Thursday O. C., and shan’t till its edge is gone–and then I’ll
know how to restore it without any delay.</p>
<p>We all go to Paris next Thursday–address, Monroe andandandand Co.,
Bankers. With love Ys Ever MARK.</p>
<p>In Paris they found pleasant quarters at the Hotel Normandy, but it
was a chilly, rainy spring, and the travelers gained a rather poor
impression of the French capital. Mark Twain’s work did not go well, at
first, because of the noises of the street. But then he found a quieter
corner in the hotel and made better progress. In a brief note to Aldrich
he said: “I sleep like a lamb and write like a lion–I mean the kind of a
lion that writes–if any such.“ He expected to finish the book in six
weeks; that is to say, before returning to America. He was looking after
its illustrations himself, and a letter to Frank Bliss, of The American
Publishing Company, refers to the frontpiece, which, from time to time,
has caused question as to its origin. To Bliss he says: “It is a thing
which I manufactured by pasting a popular comic picture into the middle
of a celebrated Biblical one–shall attribute it to Titian. It needs to
be engraved by a master.“</p>
<p>The weather continued bad in France and they left there in July to
find it little better in England. They had planned a journey to Scotland
to visit Doctor Brown, whose health was not very good. In after years
Mark Twain blamed himself harshly for not making the trip, which he
declared would have meant so much to Mrs. Clemens. He had forgotten by
that time the real reasons for not going–the continued storms and
uncertainty of trains (which made it barely possible for them to reach
Liverpool in time for their sailing-date), and with characteristic
self-reproach vowed that only perversity and obstinacy on his part had
prevented the journey to Scotland. From Liverpool, on the eve of
sailing, he sent Doctor Brown a good-by word.</p>
<p>To Dr. John Brown, in Edinburgh:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON HOTEL, LIME STREET, LIVERPOOL. Aug. (1879) MY DEAR MR.
BROWN,–During all the 15 months we have been spending on the continent,
we have been promising ourselves a sight of you as our latest and most
prized delight in a foreign land–but our hope has failed, our plan has
miscarried. One obstruction after another intruded itself, and our short
sojourn of three or four weeks on English soil was thus frittered
gradually away, and we were at last obliged to give up the idea of
seeing you at all. It is a great disappointment, for we wanted to show
you how much “Megalopis“ has grown (she is 7 now) and what a fine
creature her sister is, and how prettily they both speak German. There
are six persons in my party, and they are as difficult to cart around as
nearly any other menagerie would be. My wife and Miss Spaulding are
along, and you may imagine how they take to heart this failure of our
long promised Edinburgh trip. We never even wrote you, because we were
always so sure, from day to day, that our affairs would finally so shape
themselves as to let us get to Scotland. But no,–everything went wrong
we had only flying trips here and there in place of the leisurely ones
which we had planned.</p>
<p>We arrived in Liverpool an hour ago very tired, and have halted at
this hotel (by the advice of misguided friends)–and if my instinct and
experience are worth anything, it is the very worst hotel on earth,
without any exception. We shall move to another hotel early in the
morning to spend to-morrow. We sail for America next day in the
“Gallic.“</p>
<p>We all join in the sincerest love to you, and in the kindest
remembrance to “Jock“–[Son of Doctor Brown.]–and your sister. Truly
yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>It was September 3, 1879, that Mark Twain returned to America by the
steamer Gallic. In the seventeen months of his absence he had taken on a
“traveled look“ and had added gray hairs. A New York paper said of his
arrival that he looked older than when he went to Germany, and that his
hair had turned quite gray.</p>
<p>Mark Twain had not finished his book of travel in Paris–in fact, it
seemed to him far from complete–and he settled down rather grimly to
work on it at Quarry Farm. When, after a few days no word of greeting
came from Howells, Clemens wrote to ask if he were dead or only
sleeping. Howells hastily sent a line to say that he had been sleeping
“The sleep of a torpid conscience. I will feign that I did not know
where to write you; but I love you and all of yours, and I am
tremendously glad that you are home again. When and where shall we meet?
Have you come home with your pockets full of Atlantic papers?“ Clemens,
toiling away at his book, was, as usual, not without the prospect of
other plans. Orion, as literary material, never failed to excite
him.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Sept. 15, 1879. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–When and where? Here on the
farm would be an elegant place to meet, but of course you cannot come so
far. So we will say Hartford or Belmont, about the beginning of
November. The date of our return to Hartford is uncertain, but will be
three or four weeks hence, I judge. I hope to finish my book here before
migrating.</p>
<p>I think maybe I’ve got some Atlantic stuff in my head, but there’s
none in MS, I believe.</p>
<p>Say–a friend of mine wants to write a play with me, I to furnish the
broad-comedy cuss. I don’t know anything about his ability, but his
letter serves to remind me of our old projects. If you haven’t used
Orion or Old Wakeman, don’t you think you and I can get together and
grind out a play with one of those fellows in it? Orion is a field which
grows richer and richer the more he mulches it with each new
top-dressing of religion or other guano. Drop me an immediate line about
this, won’t you? I imagine I see Orion on the stage, always gentle,
always melancholy, always changing his politics and religion, and trying
to reform the world, always inventing something, and losing a limb by a
new kind of explosion at the end of each of the four acts. Poor old
chap, he is good material. I can imagine his wife or his sweetheart
reluctantly adopting each of his new religious in turn, just in time to
see him waltz into the next one and leave her isolated once more.</p>
<p>(Mem. Orion’s wife has followed him into the outer darkness, after 30
years’ rabid membership in the Presbyterian Church.)</p>
<p>Well, with the sincerest and most abounding love to you and yours,
from all this family, I am, Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>The idea of the play interested Howells, but he had twinges of
conscience in the matter of using Orion as material. He wrote: “More
than once I have taken the skeleton of that comedy of ours and viewed it
with tears….. I really have a compunction or two about helping to put
your brother into drama. You can say that he is your brother, to do what
you like with him, but the alien hand might inflict an incurable hurt on
his tender heart.“</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Orion Clemens had a keen appreciation of his own
shortcomings, and would have enjoyed himself in a play as much as any
observer of it. Indeed, it is more than likely that he would have been
pleased at the thought of such distinguished dramatization. From the
next letter one might almost conclude that he had received a hint of
this plan, and was bent upon supplying rich material.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Oct. 9 ’79. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Since my return, the mail
facilities have enabled Orion to keep me informed as to his intentions.
Twenty-eight days ago it was his purpose to complete a work aimed at
religion, the preface to which he had already written. Afterward he
began to sell off his furniture, with the idea of hurrying to Leadville
and tackling silver-mining–threw up his law den and took in his sign.
Then he wrote to Chicago and St. Louis newspapers asking for a situation
as “paragrapher“–enclosing a taste of his quality in the shape of two
stanzas of “humorous rhymes.“ By a later mail on the same day he applied
to New York and Hartford insurance companies for copying to do.</p>
<p>However, it would take too long to detail all his projects. They
comprise a removal to south-west Missouri; application for a reporter’s
berth on a Keokuk paper; application for a compositor’s berth on a
St. Louis paper; a re-hanging of his attorney’s sign, “though it only
creaks and catches no flies;“ but last night’s letter informs me that he
has retackled the religious question, hired a distant den to write in,
applied to my mother for 0 to re-buy his furniture, which has advanced
in value since the sale–purposes buying 5 worth of books necessary to
his labors which he had previously been borrowing, and his first chapter
is already on its way to me for my decision as to whether it has enough
ungodliness in it or not. Poor Orion!</p>
<p>Your letter struck me while I was meditating a project to beguile
you, and John Hay and Joe Twichell, into a descent upon Chicago which I
dream of making, to witness the re-union of the great Commanders of the
Western Army Corps on the 9th of next month. My sluggish soul needs a
fierce upstirring, and if it would not get it when Grant enters the
meeting place I must doubtless “lay“ for the final resurrection. Can you
and Hay go? At the same time, confound it, I doubt if I can go myself,
for this book isn’t done yet. But I would give a heap to be there. I
mean to heave some holiness into the Hartford primaries when I go back;
and if there was a solitary office in the land which majestic ignorance
and incapacity, coupled with purity of heart, could fill, I would run
for it. This naturally reminds me of Bret Harte–but let him pass.</p>
<p>We propose to leave here for New York Oct. 21, reaching Hartford 24th
or 25th. If, upon reflection, you Howellses find, you can stop over here
on your way, I wish you would do it, and telegraph me. Getting pretty
hungry to see you. I had an idea that this was your shortest way home,
but like as not my geography is crippled again–it usually is. Yrs ever
MARK.</p>
<p>The “Reunion of the Great Commanders,“ mentioned in the foregoing,
was a welcome to General Grant after his journey around the world.
Grant’s trip had been one continuous ovation–a triumphal march. In ’79
most of his old commanders were still alive, and they had planned to
assemble in Chicago to do him honor. A Presidential year was coming on,
but if there was anything political in the project there were no surface
indications. Mark Twain, once a Confederate soldier, had long since been
completely “desouthernized“–at least to the point where he felt that the
sight of old comrades paying tribute to the Union commander would stir
his blood as perhaps it had not been stirred, even in that earlier time,
when that same commander had chased him through the Missouri swamps.
Grant, indeed, had long since become a hero to Mark Twain, though it is
highly unlikely that Clemens favored the idea of a third term. Some days
following the preceding letter an invitation came for him to be present
at the Chicago reunion; but by this time he had decided not to go. The
letter he wrote has been preserved.</p>
<p>To Gen. William E. Strong, in Chicago:</p>
<p>FARMINGTON AVENUE, HARTFORD. Oct. 28, 1879. GEN. WM. E. STRONG, CH’M,
AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:</p>
<p>I have been hoping during several weeks that it might be my good
fortune to receive an invitation to be present on that great occasion in
Chicago; but now that my desire is accomplished my business matters have
so shaped themselves as to bar me from being so far from home in the
first half of November. It is with supreme regret that I lost this
chance, for I have not had a thorough stirring up for some years, and I
judged that if I could be in the banqueting hall and see and hear the
veterans of the Army of the Tennessee at the moment that their old
commander entered the room, or rose in his place to speak, my system
would get the kind of upheaval it needs. General Grant’s progress across
the continent is of the marvelous nature of the returning Napoleon’s
progress from Grenoble to Paris; and as the crowning spectacle in the
one case was the meeting with the Old Guard, so, likewise, the crowning
spectacle in the other will be our great captain’s meeting with his Old
Guard–and that is the very climax which I wanted to witness.</p>
<p>Besides, I wanted to see the General again, any way, and renew the
acquaintance. He would remember me, because I was the person who did not
ask him for an office. However, I consume your time, and also wander
from the point–which is, to thank you for the courtesy of your
invitation, and yield up my seat at the table to some other guest who
may possibly grace it better, but will certainly not appreciate its
privileges more, than I should. With great respect, I am, Gentlemen,
Very truly yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Private:–I beg to apologize for my delay, gentlemen, but the card of
invitation went to Elmira, N. Y. and hence has only just now reached
me.</p>
<p>This letter was not sent. He reconsidered and sent an acceptance,
agreeing to speak, as the committee had requested. Certainly there was
something picturesque in the idea of the Missouri private who had been
chased for a rainy fortnight through the swamps of Ralls County being
selected now to join in welcome to his ancient enemy.</p>
<p>The great reunion was to be something more than a mere banquet. It
would continue for several days, with processions, great assemblages,
and much oratory.</p>
<p>Mark Twain arrived in Chicago in good season to see it all. Three
letters to Mrs. Clemens intimately present his experiences: his
enthusiastic enjoyment and his own personal triumph.</p>
<p>The first was probably written after the morning of his arrival. The
Doctor Jackson in it was Dr. A. Reeves Jackson, the guide-dismaying
“Doctor“ of Innocents Abroad.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Hartford:</p>
<p>PALMER HOUSE, CHICAGO, Nov. 11. Livy darling, I am getting a trifle
leg-weary. Dr. Jackson called and dragged me out of bed at noon,
yesterday, and then went off. I went down stairs and was introduced to
some scores of people, and among them an elderly German gentleman named
Raster, who said his wife owed her life to me–hurt in Chicago fire and
lay menaced with death a long time, but the Innocents Abroad kept her
mind in a cheerful attitude, and so, with the doctor’s help for the body
she pulled through…. They drove me to Dr. Jackson’s and I had an hour’s
visit with Mrs. Jackson. Started to walk down Michigan Avenue, got a few
steps on my way and met an erect, soldierly looking young gentleman who
offered his hand; said, “Mr. Clemens, I believe–I wish to introduce
myself–you were pointed out to me yesterday as I was driving down
street–my name is Grant.“</p>
<p>“Col. Fred Grant?“</p>
<p>“Yes. My house is not ten steps away, and I would like you to come
and have a talk and a pipe, and let me introduce my wife.“</p>
<p>So we turned back and entered the house next to Jackson’s and talked
something more than an hour and smoked many pipes and had a sociable
good time. His wife is very gentle and intelligent and pretty, and they
have a cunning little girl nearly as big as Bay but only three years
old. They wanted me to come in and spend an evening, after the banquet,
with them and Gen. Grant, after this grand pow-wow is over, but I said I
was going home Friday. Then they asked me to come Friday afternoon, when
they and the general will receive a few friends, and I said I would.
Col. Grant said he and Gen. Sherman used the Innocents Abroad as their
guide book when they were on their travels.</p>
<p>I stepped in next door and took Dr. Jackson to the hotel and we
played billiards from 7 to 11.30 P.M. and then went to a beer-mill to
meet some twenty Chicago journalists–talked, sang songs and made
speeches till 6 o’clock this morning. Nobody got in the least degree
“under the influence,“ and we had a pleasant time. Read awhile in bed,
slept till 11, shaved, went to breakfast at noon, and by mistake got
into the servants’ hall. I remained there and breakfasted with twenty or
thirty male and female servants, though I had a table to myself.</p>
<p>A temporary structure, clothed and canopied with flags, has been
erected at the hotel front, and connected with the second-story windows
of a drawing-room. It was for Gen. Grant to stand on and review the
procession. Sixteen persons, besides reporters, had tickets for this
place, and a seventeenth was issued for me. I was there, looking down on
the packed and struggling crowd when Gen. Grant came forward and was
saluted by the cheers of the multitude and the waving of ladies’
handkerchiefs–for the windows and roofs of all neighboring buildings
were massed full of life. Gen. Grant bowed to the people two or three
times, then approached my side of the platform and the mayor pulled me
forward and introduced me. It was dreadfully conspicuous. The General
said a word or so–I replied, and then said, “But I’ll step back,
General, I don’t want to interrupt your speech.“</p>
<p>“But I’m not going to make any–stay where you are–I’ll get you to
make it for me.“</p>
<p>General Sherman came on the platform wearing the uniform of a full
General, and you should have heard the cheers. Gen. Logan was going to
introduce me, but I didn’t want any more conspicuousness.</p>
<p>When the head of the procession passed it was grand to see Sheridan,
in his military cloak and his plumed chapeau, sitting as erect and rigid
as a statue on his immense black horse–by far the most martial figure I
ever saw. And the crowd roared again.</p>
<p>It was chilly, and Gen. Deems lent me his overcoat until night. He
came a few minutes ago–5.45 P.M., and got it, but brought Gen. Willard,
who lent me his for the rest of my stay, and will get another for
himself when he goes home to dinner. Mine is much too heavy for this
warm weather.</p>
<p>I have a seat on the stage at Haverley’s Theatre, tonight, where the
Army of the Tennessee will receive Gen. Grant, and where Gen. Sherman
will make a speech. At midnight I am to attend a meeting of the Owl
Club.</p>
<p>I love you ever so much, my darling, and am hoping to get a word from
you yet. SAML.</p>
<p>Following the procession, which he describes, came the grand
ceremonies of welcome at Haverley’s Theatre. The next letter is written
the following morning, or at least soiree time the following day, after
a night of ratification.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Hartford:</p>
<p>CHICAGO, Nov. 12, ’79. Livy darling, it was a great time. There were
perhaps thirty people on the stage of the theatre, and I think I never
sat elbow-to-elbow with so many historic names before. Grant, Sherman,
Sheridan, Schofield, Pope, Logan, Augur, and so on. What an iron man
Grant is! He sat facing the house, with his right leg crossed over his
left and his right boot-sole tilted up at an angle, and his left hand
and arm reposing on the arm of his chair–you note that position? Well,
when glowing references were made to other grandees on the stage, those
grandees always showed a trifle of nervous consciousness–and as these
references came frequently, the nervous change of position and attitude
were also frequent. But Grant!–he was under a tremendous and ceaseless
bombardment of praise and gratulation, but as true as I’m sitting here
he never moved a muscle of his body for a single instant, during 30
minutes! You could have played him on a stranger for an effigy. Perhaps
he never would have moved, but at last a speaker made such a
particularly ripping and blood-stirring remark about him that the
audience rose and roared and yelled and stamped and clapped an entire
minute–Grant sitting as serene as ever–when Gen. Sherman stepped to him,
laid his hand affectionately on his shoulder, bent respectfully down and
whispered in his ear. Gen. Grant got up and bowed, and the storm of
applause swelled into a hurricane. He sat down, took about the same
position and froze to it till by and by there was another of those
deafening and protracted roars, when Sherman made him get up and bow
again. He broke up his attitude once more–the extent of something more
than a hair’s breadth–to indicate me to Sherman when the house was
keeping up a determined and persistent call for me, and poor bewildered
Sherman, (who did not know me), was peering abroad over the packed
audience for me, not knowing I was only three feet from him and most
conspicuously located, (Gen. Sherman was Chairman.)</p>
<p>One of the most illustrious individuals on that stage was “Ole Abe,“
the historic war eagle. He stood on his perch–the old savage-eyed rascal
–three or four feet behind Gen. Sherman, and as he had been in nearly
every battle that was mentioned by the orators his soul was probably
stirred pretty often, though he was too proud to let on.</p>
<p>Read Logan’s bosh, and try to imagine a burly and magnificent Indian,
in General’s uniform, striking a heroic attitude and getting that stuff
off in the style of a declaiming school-boy.</p>
<p>Please put the enclosed scraps in the drawer and I will scrap-book
them.</p>
<p>I only staid at the Owl Club till 3 this morning and drank little or
nothing. Went to sleep without whisky. Ich liebe dish.</p>
<p>SAML.</p>
<p>But it is in the third letter that we get the climax. On the same day
he wrote a letter to Howells, which, in part, is very similar in
substance and need not be included here.</p>
<p>A paragraph, however, must not be omitted.</p>
<p>“Imagine what it was like to see a bullet-shredded old battle-flag
reverently unfolded to the gaze of a thousand middle-aged soldiers, most
of whom hadn’t seen it since they saw it advancing over victorious
fields, when they were in their prime. And imagine what it was like when
Grant, their first commander, stepped into view while they were still
going mad over the flag, and then right in the midst of it all somebody
struck up, ‘When we were marching through Georgia.’ Well, you should
have heard the thousand voices lift that chorus and seen the tears
stream down. If I live a hundred years I shan’t ever forget these
things, nor be able to talk about them …. Grand times, my boy, grand
times!“</p>
<p>At the great banquet Mark Twain’s speech had been put last on the
program, to hold the house. He had been invited to respond to the toast
of “The Ladies,“ but had replied that he had already responded to that
toast more than once. There was one class of the community, he said,
commonly overlooked on these occasions–the babies–he would respond to
that toast. In his letter to Howells he had not been willing to speak
freely of his personal triumph, but to Mrs. Clemens he must tell it all,
and with that child-like ingenuousness which never failed him to his
last day.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Hartford:</p>
<p>CHICAGO, Nov. 14 ’79. A little after 5 in the morning.</p>
<p>I’ve just come to my room, Livy darling, I guess this was the
memorable night of my life. By George, I never was so stirred since I
was born. I heard four speeches which I can never forget. One by Emory
Storrs, one by Gen. Vilas (O, wasn’t it wonderful!) one by Gen. Logan
(mighty stirring), one by somebody whose name escapes me, and one by
that splendid old soul, Col. Bob Ingersoll,–oh, it was just the
supremest combination of English words that was ever put together since
the world began. My soul, how handsome he looked, as he stood on that
table, in the midst of those 500 shouting men, and poured the molten
silver from his lips! Lord, what an organ is human speech when it is
played by a master! All these speeches may look dull in print, but how
the lightning glared around them when they were uttered, and how the
crowd roared in response! It was a great night, a memorable night. I am
so richly repaid for my journey–and how I did wish with all my whole
heart that you were there to be lifted into the very seventh heaven of
enthusiasm, as I was. The army songs, the military music, the crashing
applause –Lord bless me, it was unspeakable.</p>
<p>Out of compliment they placed me last in the list–No. 15–I was to
“hold the crowd“–and bless my life I was in awful terror when No. 14.
rose, at a o’clock this morning and killed all the enthusiasm by
delivering the flattest, insipidest, silliest of all responses to
“Woman“ that ever a weary multitude listened to. Then Gen. Sherman
(Chairman) announced my toast, and the crowd gave me a good round of
applause as I mounted on top of the dinner table, but it was only on
account of my name, nothing more –they were all tired and wretched. They
let my first sentence go in. silence, till I paused and added “we stand
on common ground“–then they burst forth like a hurricane and I saw that
I had them! From that time on, I stopped at the end of each sentence,
and let the tornado of applause and laughter sweep around me–and when I
closed with “And if the child is but the prophecy of the man, there are
mighty few who will doubt that he succeeded,“ I say it who oughtn’t to
say it, the house came down with a crash. For two hours and a half, now,
I’ve been shaking hands and listening to congratulations. Gen. Sherman
said, “Lord bless you, my boy, I don’t know how you do it–it’s a secret
that’s beyond me–but it was great–give me your hand again.“</p>
<p>And do you know, Gen. Grant sat through fourteen speeches like a
graven image, but I fetched him! I broke him up, utterly! He told me he
laughed till the tears came and every bone in his body ached. (And do
you know, the biggest part of the success of the speech lay in the fact
that the audience saw that for once in his life he had been knocked out
of his iron serenity.)</p>
<p>Bless your soul, ’twas immense. I never was so proud in my life. Lots
and lots of people–hundreds I might say–told me my speech was the
triumph of the evening–which was a lie. Ladies, Tom, Dick and Harry
–even the policemen–captured me in the halls and shook hands, and scores
of army officers said “We shall always be grateful to you for coming.“
General Pope came to bunt me up–I was afraid to speak to him on that
theatre stage last night, thinking it might be presumptuous to tackle a
man so high up in military history. Gen. Schofield, and other historic
men, paid their compliments. Sheridan was ill and could not come, but
I’m to go with a General of his staff and see him before I go to Col.
Grant’s. Gen. Augur–well, I’ve talked with them all, received
invitations from them all–from people living everywhere–and as I said
before, it’s a memorable night. I wouldn’t have missed it for anything
in the world.</p>
<p>But my sakes, you should have heard Ingersoll’s speech on that table!
Half an hour ago he ran across me in the crowded halls and put his arms
about me and said “Mark, if I live a hundred years, I’ll always be
grateful for your speech–Lord what a supreme thing it was.“ But I told
him it wasn’t any use to talk, he had walked off with the honors of that
occasion by something of a majority. Bully boy is Ingersoll–traveled
with him in the cars the other day, and you can make up your mind we had
a good time.</p>
<p>Of course I forgot to go and pay for my hotel car and so secure it,
but the army officers told me an hour ago to rest easy, they would go at
once, at this unholy hour of the night and compel the railways to do
their duty by me, and said “You don’t need to request the Army of the
Tennessee to do your desires–you can command its services.“</p>
<p>Well, I bummed around that banquet hall from 8 in the evening till 2
in the morning, talking with people and listening to speeches, and I
never ate a single bite or took a sup of anything but ice water, so if I
seem excited now, it is the intoxication of supreme enthusiasm. By
George, it was a grand night, a historical night.</p>
<p>And now it is a quarter past 6 A.M.–so good bye and God bless you and
the Bays,–[Family word for babies]–my darlings</p>
<p>SAML.</p>
<p>Show it to Joe if you want to–I saw some of his friends here.</p>
<p>Mark Twain’s admiration for Robert Ingersoll was very great, and we
may believe that he was deeply impressed by the Chicago speech, when we
find him, a few days later, writing to Ingersoll for a perfect copy to
read to a young girls’ club in Hartford. Ingersoll sent the speech, also
some of his books, and the next letter is Mark Twain’s
acknowledgment.</p>
<p>To Col. Robert G. Ingersoll:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Dec. 14. MY DEAR INGERSOLL,–Thank you most heartily for the
books–I am devouring them–they have found a hungry place, and they
content it and satisfy it to a miracle. I wish I could hear you speak
these splendid chapters before a great audience–to read them by myself
and hear the boom of the applause only in the ear of my imagination,
leaves a something wanting –and there is also a still greater lack, your
manner, and voice, and presence.</p>
<p>The Chicago speech arrived an hour too late, but I was all right
anyway, for I found that my memory had been able to correct all the
errors. I read it to the Saturday Club (of young girls) and told them to
remember that it was doubtful if its superior existed in our language.
Truly Yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The reader may remember Mark Twain’s Whittier dinner speech of 1877,
and its disastrous effects. Now, in 1879, there was to be another
Atlantic gathering: a breakfast to Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, to which
Clemens was invited. He was not eager to accept; it would naturally
recall memories of two years before, but being urged by both Howells and
Warner, he agreed to attend if they would permit him to speak. Mark
Twain never lacked courage and he wanted to redeem himself. To Howells
he wrote:</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Nov. 28, 1879. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–If anybody talks, there, I
shall claim the right to say a word myself, and be heard among the very
earliest–else it would be confoundedly awkward for me–and for the rest,
too. But you may read what I say, beforehand, and strike out whatever
you choose.</p>
<p>Of course I thought it wisest not to be there at all; but Warner took
the opposite view, and most strenuously.</p>
<p>Speaking of Johnny’s conclusion to become an outlaw, reminds me of
Susie’s newest and very earnest longing–to have crooked teeth and
glasses–“like Mamma.“</p>
<p>I would like to look into a child’s head, once, and see what its
processes are. Yrs ever, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The matter turned out well. Clemens, once more introduced by
Howells–this time conservatively, it may be said–delivered a delicate
and fitting tribute to Doctor Holmes, full of graceful humor and
grateful acknowledgment, the kind of speech he should have given at the
Whittier dinner of two years before. No reference was made to his former
disaster, and this time he came away covered with glory, and fully
restored in his self-respect.</p>
