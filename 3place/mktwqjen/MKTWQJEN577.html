<h4 id="chapter-9">CHAPTER 9</h4>
<p>Tom Practices Sycophancy</p>
<p>Why is it that we rejoice at a birth and grieve at a funeral? It is
because we are not the person involved.</p>
<p>–Pudd’nhead Wilson’s Calendar</p>
<p>It is easy to find fault, if one has that disposition. There was once
a man who, not being able to find any other fault with his coal,
complained that there were too many prehistoric toads in it.</p>
<p>–Pudd’nhead Wilson’s Calendar</p>
<p>Tom flung himself on the sofa, and put his throbbing head in his
hands, and rested his elbows on his knees. He rocked himself back and
forth and moaned.</p>
<p>“I’ve knelt to a nigger wench!“ he muttered. “I thought I had struck
the deepest depths of degradation before, but oh, dear, it was nothing
to this. . . . Well, there is one consolation, such as it is–I’ve struck
bottom this time; there’s nothing lower.“</p>
<p>But that was a hasty conclusion.</p>
<p>At ten that night he climbed the ladder in the haunted house, pale,
weak, and wretched. Roxy was standing in the door of one of the rooms,
waiting, for she had heard him.</p>
<p>This was a two-story log house which had acquired the reputation a
few years ago of being haunted, and that was the end of its usefulness.
Nobody would live in it afterward, or go near it by night, and most
people even gave it a wide berth in the daytime. As it had no
competition, it was called <em>the</em> haunted house. It was getting
crazy and ruinous now, from long neglect. It stood three hundred yards
beyond Pudd’nhead Wilson’s house, with nothing between but vacancy. It
was the last house in the town at that end.</p>
<p>Tom followed Roxy into the room. She had a pile of clean straw in the
corner for a bed, some cheap but well-kept clothing was hanging on the
wall, there was a tin lantern freckling the floor with little spots of
light, and there were various soap and candle boxes scattered about,
which served for chairs. The two sat down. Roxy said:</p>
<p>“Now den, I’ll tell you straight off, en I’ll begin to k’leck de
money later on; I ain’t in no hurry. What does you reckon I’s gwine to
tell you?“</p>
<p>“Well, you–you–oh, Roxy, don’t make it too hard for me! Come right
out and tell me you’ve found out somehow what a shape I’m in on account
of dissipation and foolishness.“</p>
<p>“Disposition en foolishness! NO sir, dat ain’t it. Dat jist ain’t
nothin’ at all, ‘longside o’ what <em>I</em> knows.“</p>
<p>Tom stared at her, and said:</p>
<p>“Why, Roxy, what do you mean?“</p>
<p>She rose, and gloomed above him like a Fate.</p>
<p>“I means dis–en it’s de Lord’s truth. You ain’t no more kin to ole
Marse Driscoll den I is! <em>dat’s</em> what I means!“ and her eyes
flamed with triumph.</p>
<p>“What?“</p>
<p>“Yassir, en <em>dat</em> ain’t all! You’s a
<em>nigger!</em>–<em>bawn</em> a nigger and a <em>slave!</em>–en you’s a
nigger en a slave dis minute; en if I opens my mouf ole Marse
Driscoll’ll sell you down de river befo’ you is two days older den what
you is now!“</p>
<p>“It’s a thundering lie, you miserable old blatherskite!“</p>
<p>“It ain’t no lie, nuther. It’s just de truth, en nothin’ <em>but</em>
de truth, so he’p me. Yassir–you’s my <em>son</em>–“</p>
<p>“You devil!“</p>
<p>“En dat po’ boy dat you’s be’n a-kickin’ en a-cuffin’ today is Percy
Driscoll’s son en yo’ <em>marster</em>–“</p>
<p>“You beast!“</p>
<p>“En <em>his</em> name is Tom Driscoll, en <em>yo’s</em> name’s Valet
de Chambers, en you ain’t GOT no fambly name, beca’se niggers don’t
<em>have</em> em!“</p>
<p>Tom sprang up and seized a billet of wood and raised it, but his
mother only laughed at him, and said:</p>
<p>“Set down, you pup! Does you think you kin skyer me? It ain’t in you,
nor de likes of you. I reckon you’d shoot me in de back, maybe, if you
got a chance, for dat’s jist yo’ style–<em>I</em> knows you, throo en
throo–but I don’t mind gitt’n killed, beca’se all dis is down in writin’
and it’s in safe hands, too, en de man dat’s got it knows whah to look
for de right man when I gits killed. Oh, bless yo’ soul, if you puts yo’
mother up for as big a fool as <em>you</em> is, you’s pow’ful mistaken,
I kin tell you! Now den, you set still en behave yo’self; en don’t you
git up ag’in till I tell you!“</p>
<p>Tom fretted and chafed awhile in a whirlwind of disorganizing
sensations and emotions, and finally said, with something like settled
conviction:</p>
<p>“The whole thing is moonshine; now then, go ahead and do your worst;
I’m done with you.“</p>
<p>Roxy made no answer. She took the lantern and started for the door.
Tom was in a cold panic in a moment.</p>
<p>“Come back, come back!“ he wailed. “I didn’t mean it, Roxy; I take it
all back, and I’ll never say it again! Please come back, Roxy!“</p>
<p>The woman stood a moment, then she said gravely:</p>
<p>“Dat’s one thing you’s got to stop, Valet de Chambers. You can’t call
me <em>Roxy</em>, same as if you was my equal. Chillen don’t speak to
dey mammies like dat. You’ll call me ma or mammy, dat’s what you’ll call
me–leastways when de ain’t nobody aroun’. <em>Say</em> it!“</p>
<p>It cost Tom a struggle, but he got it out.</p>
<p>“Dat’s all right, don’t you ever forgit it ag’in, if you knows what’s
good for you. Now den, you had said you wouldn’t ever call it lies en
moonshine ag’in. I’ll tell you dis, for a warnin’: if you ever does say
it ag’in, it’s de LAS’ time you’ll ever say it to me; I’ll tramp as
straight to de judge as I kin walk, en tell him who you is, en
<em>prove</em> it. Does you b’lieve me when I says dat?“</p>
<p>“Oh,“ groaned Tom, “I more than believe it; I <em>know</em> it.“</p>
<p>Roxy knew her conquest was complete. She could have proved nothing to
anybody, and her threat of writings was a lie; but she knew the person
she was dealing with, and had made both statements without any doubt as
to the effect they would produce.</p>
<p>She went and sat down on her candle box, and the pride and pomp of
her victorious attitude made it a throne. She said:</p>
<p>“Now den, Chambers, we’s gwine to talk business, en dey ain’t gwine
to be no mo’ foolishness. In de fust place, you gits fifty dollahs a
month; you’s gwine to han’ over half of it to yo’ ma. Plank it out!“</p>
<p>But Tom had only six dollars in the world. He gave her that, and
promised to start fair on next month’s pension.</p>
<p>“Chambers, how much is you in debt?“</p>
<p>Tom shuddered, and said:</p>
<p>“Nearly three hundred dollars.“</p>
<p>“How is you gwine to pay it?“</p>
<p>Tom groaned out: “Oh, I don’t know; don’t ask me such awful
questions.“</p>
<p>But she stuck to her point until she wearied a confession out of him:
he had been prowling about in disguise, stealing small valuables from
private houses; in fact, he made a good deal of a raid on his fellow
villagers a fortnight before, when he was supposed to be in St. Louis;
but he doubted if he had sent away enough stuff to realize the required
amount, and was afraid to make a further venture in the present excited
state of the town. His mother approved of his conduct, and offered to
help, but this frightened him. He tremblingly ventured to say that if
she would retire from the town he should feel better and safer, and
could hold his head higher–and was going on to make an argument, but she
interrupted and surprised him pleasantly by saying she was ready; it
didn’t make any difference to her where she stayed, so that she got her
share of the pension regularly. She said she would not go far, and would
call at the haunted house once a month for her money. Then she said:</p>
<p>“I don’t hate you so much now, but I’ve hated you a many a year–and
anybody would. Didn’t I change you off, en give you a good fambly en a
good name, en made you a white gen’l’man en rich, wid store clothes
on–en what did I git for it? You despised me all de time, en was al’ays
sayin’ mean hard things to me befo’ folks, en wouldn’t ever let me
forgit I’s a nigger–en–en–“</p>
<p>She fell to sobbing, and broke down. Tom said: “But you know I didn’t
know you were my mother; and besides–“</p>
<p>“Well, nemmine ’bout dat, now; let it go. I’s gwine to fo’git it.“
Then she added fiercely, “En don’t ever make me remember it ag’in, or
you’ll be sorry, <em>I</em> tell you.“</p>
<p>When they were parting, Tom said, in the most persuasive way he could
command:</p>
<p>“Ma, would you mind telling me who was my father?“</p>
<p>He had supposed he was asking an embarrassing question. He was
mistaken. Roxy drew herself up with a proud toss of her head, and
said:</p>
<p>“Does I mine tellin’ you? No, dat I don’t! You ain’t got no ‘casion
to be shame’ o’ yo’ father, <em>I</em> kin tell you. He wuz de highest
quality in dis whole town–ole Virginny stock. Fust famblies, he wuz. Jes
as good stock as de Driscolls en de Howards, de bes’ day dey ever seed.“
She put on a little prouder air, if possible, and added impressively:
“Does you ‘member Cunnel Cecil Burleigh Essex, dat died de same year yo’
young Marse Tom Driscoll’s pappy died, en all de Masons en Odd Fellers
en Churches turned out en give him de bigges’ funeral dis town ever
seed? Dat’s de man.“</p>
<p>Under the inspiration of her soaring complacency the departed graces
of her earlier days returned to her, and her bearing took to itself a
dignity and state that might have passed for queenly if her surroundings
had been a little more in keeping with it.</p>
<p>“Dey ain’t another nigger in dis town dat’s as highbawn as you is.
Now den, go ‘long! En jes you hold yo’ head up as high as you want
to–you has de right, en dat I kin swah.“</p>
