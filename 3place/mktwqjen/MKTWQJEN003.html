<h4 id="chapter-ii.">CHAPTER II.</h4>
<p>Occasionally, during the following month, I dropped in at 117 Wall
Street to inquire how the repairing and refurnishing of the vessel was
coming on, how additions to the passenger list were averaging, how many
people the committee were decreeing not “select“ every day and banishing
in sorrow and tribulation. I was glad to know that we were to have a
little printing press on board and issue a daily newspaper of our own. I
was glad to learn that our piano, our parlor organ, and our melodeon
were to be the best instruments of the kind that could be had in the
market. I was proud to observe that among our excursionists were three
ministers of the gospel, eight doctors, sixteen or eighteen ladies,
several military and naval chieftains with sounding titles, an ample
crop of “Professors“ of various kinds, and a gentleman who had
“COMMISSIONER OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO EUROPE, ASIA, AND
AFRICA“ thundering after his name in one awful blast! I had carefully
prepared myself to take rather a back seat in that ship because of the
uncommonly select material that would alone be permitted to pass through
the camel’s eye of that committee on credentials; I had schooled myself
to expect an imposing array of military and naval heroes and to have to
set that back seat still further back in consequence of it maybe; but I
state frankly that I was all unprepared for this crusher.</p>
<p>I fell under that titular avalanche a torn and blighted thing. I said
that if that potentate must go over in our ship, why, I supposed he must
–but that to my thinking, when the United States considered it necessary
to send a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean, it would be in
better taste, and safer, to take him apart and cart him over in sections
in several ships.</p>
<p>Ah, if I had only known then that he was only a common mortal, and
that his mission had nothing more overpowering about it than the
collecting of seeds and uncommon yams and extraordinary cabbages and
peculiar bullfrogs for that poor, useless, innocent, mildewed old fossil
the Smithsonian Institute, I would have felt so much relieved.</p>
<p>During that memorable month I basked in the happiness of being for
once in my life drifting with the tide of a great popular movement.
Everybody was going to Europe–I, too, was going to Europe. Everybody was
going to the famous Paris Exposition–I, too, was going to the Paris
Exposition. The steamship lines were carrying Americans out of the
various ports of the country at the rate of four or five thousand a week
in the aggregate. If I met a dozen individuals during that month who
were not going to Europe shortly, I have no distinct remembrance of it
now. I walked about the city a good deal with a young Mr. Blucher, who
was booked for the excursion. He was confiding, good-natured,
unsophisticated, companionable; but he was not a man to set the river on
fire. He had the most extraordinary notions about this European exodus
and came at last to consider the whole nation as packing up for
emigration to France. We stepped into a store on Broadway one day, where
he bought a handkerchief, and when the man could not make change, Mr. B.
said:</p>
<p>“Never mind, I’ll hand it to you in Paris.“</p>
<p>“But I am not going to Paris.“</p>
<p>“How is–what did I understand you to say?“</p>
<p>“I said I am not going to Paris.“</p>
<p>“Not going to Paris! Not g—- well, then, where in the nation are you
going to?“</p>
<p>“Nowhere at all.“</p>
<p>“Not anywhere whatsoever?–not any place on earth but this?“</p>
<p>“Not any place at all but just this–stay here all summer.“</p>
<p>My comrade took his purchase and walked out of the store without a
word –walked out with an injured look upon his countenance. Up the
street apiece he broke silence and said impressively: “It was a lie–that
is my opinion of it!“</p>
<p>In the fullness of time the ship was ready to receive her passengers.
I was introduced to the young gentleman who was to be my roommate, and
found him to be intelligent, cheerful of spirit, unselfish, full of
generous impulses, patient, considerate, and wonderfully good-natured.
Not any passenger that sailed in the Quaker City will withhold his
endorsement of what I have just said. We selected a stateroom forward of
the wheel, on the starboard side, “below decks.“ It bad two berths in
it, a dismal dead-light, a sink with a washbowl in it, and a long,
sumptuously cushioned locker, which was to do service as a sofa–partly
–and partly as a hiding place for our things. Notwithstanding all this
furniture, there was still room to turn around in, but not to swing a
cat in, at least with entire security to the cat. However, the room was
large, for a ship’s stateroom, and was in every way satisfactory.</p>
<p>The vessel was appointed to sail on a certain Saturday early in
June.</p>
<p>A little after noon on that distinguished Saturday I reached the ship
and went on board. All was bustle and confusion. [I have seen that
remark before somewhere.] The pier was crowded with carriages and men;
passengers were arriving and hurrying on board; the vessel’s decks were
encumbered with trunks and valises; groups of excursionists, arrayed in
unattractive traveling costumes, were moping about in a drizzling rain
and looking as droopy and woebegone as so many molting chickens. The
gallant flag was up, but it was under the spell, too, and hung limp and
disheartened by the mast. Altogether, it was the bluest, bluest
spectacle! It was a pleasure excursion–there was no gainsaying that,
because the program said so–it was so nominated in the bond–but it
surely hadn’t the general aspect of one.</p>
<p>Finally, above the banging, and rumbling, and shouting, and hissing
of steam rang the order to “cast off!“–a sudden rush to the gangways–a
scampering ashore of visitors-a revolution of the wheels, and we were
off–the pic-nic was begun! Two very mild cheers went up from the
dripping crowd on the pier; we answered them gently from the slippery
decks; the flag made an effort to wave, and failed; the “battery of
guns“ spake not–the ammunition was out.</p>
<p>We steamed down to the foot of the harbor and came to anchor. It was
still raining. And not only raining, but storming. “Outside“ we could
see, ourselves, that there was a tremendous sea on. We must lie still,
in the calm harbor, till the storm should abate. Our passengers hailed
from fifteen states; only a few of them had ever been to sea before;
manifestly it would not do to pit them against a full-blown tempest
until they had got their sea-legs on. Toward evening the two steam tugs
that had accompanied us with a rollicking champagne-party of young New
Yorkers on board who wished to bid farewell to one of our number in due
and ancient form departed, and we were alone on the deep. On deep five
fathoms, and anchored fast to the bottom. And out in the solemn rain, at
that. This was pleasuring with a vengeance.</p>
<p>It was an appropriate relief when the gong sounded for prayer
meeting. The first Saturday night of any other pleasure excursion might
have been devoted to whist and dancing; but I submit it to the
unprejudiced mind if it would have been in good taste for us to engage
in such frivolities, considering what we had gone through and the frame
of mind we were in. We would have shone at a wake, but not at anything
more festive.</p>
<p>However, there is always a cheering influence about the sea; and in
my berth that night, rocked by the measured swell of the waves and
lulled by the murmur of the distant surf, I soon passed tranquilly out
of all consciousness of the dreary experiences of the day and damaging
premonitions of the future.</p>
