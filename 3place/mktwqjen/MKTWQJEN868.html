<h4 id="chapter-v.">CHAPTER V.</h4>
<p>Thus far we have a part of Mrs. Eddy’s portrait. Not made of
fictions, surmises, reports, rumors, innuendoes, dropped by her enemies;
no, she has furnished all of the materials herself, and laid them on the
canvas, under my general superintendence and direction. As far as she
has gone with it, it is the presentation of a complacent, commonplace,
illiterate New England woman who “forgot everything she knew“ when she
discovered her discovery, then wrote a Bible in good English under the
inspiration of God, and climbed up it to the supremest summit of earthly
grandeur attainable by man–where she sits serene to-day, beloved and
worshiped by a multitude of human beings of as good average intelligence
as is possessed by those that march under the banner of any competing
cult. This is not intended to flatter the competing cults, it is merely
a statement of cold fact.</p>
<p>That a commonplace person should go climbing aloft and become a god
or a half-god or a quarter-god and be worshiped by men and women of
average intelligence, is nothing. It has happened a million times, it
will happen a hundred million more. It has been millions of years since
the first of these supernaturals appeared, and by the time the last one
in that inconceivably remote future shall have performed his solemn
little high-jinks on the stage and closed the business, there will be
enough of them accumulated in the museum on the Other Side to start a
heaven of their own-and jam it.</p>
<p>Each in his turn those little supernaturals of our by-gone ages and
aeons joined the monster procession of his predecessors and marched
horizonward, disappeared, and was forgotten. They changed nothing, they
built nothing, they left nothing behind them to remember them by,
nothing to hold their disciples together, nothing to solidify their work
and enable it to defy the assaults of time and the weather. They passed,
and left a vacancy. They made one fatal mistake; they all made it, each
in his turn: they failed to organize their forces, they failed to
centralize their strength, they failed to provide a fresh Bible and a
sure and perpetual cash income for business, and often they failed to
provide a new and accepted Divine Personage to worship.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is not of that small fry. The materials that go to the
making of the rest of her portrait will prove it. She will furnish them
herself:</p>
<p>She published her book. She copyrighted it. She copyrights
everything. If she should say, “Good-morning; how do you do?“ she would
copyright it; for she is a careful person, and knows the value of small
things.</p>
<p>She began to teach her Science, she began to heal, she began to
gather converts to her new religion–fervent, sincere, devoted, grateful
people. A year or two later she organized her first Christian Science
“Association,“ with six of her disciples on the roster.</p>
<p>She continued to teach and heal. She was charging nothing, she says,
although she was very poor. She taught and healed gratis four years
altogether, she says.</p>
<p>Then, in 1879-81 she was become strong enough, and well enough
established, to venture a couple of impressively important moves. The
first of these moves was to aggrandize the “Association“ to a “Church.“
Brave? It is the right name for it, I think. The former name suggests
nothing, invited no remark, no criticism, no inquiry, no hostility; the
new name invited them all. She must have made this intrepid venture on
her own motion. She could have had no important advisers at that early
day. If we accept it as her own idea and her own act–and I think we
must–we have one key to her character. And it will explain subsequent
acts of hers that would merely stun us and stupefy us without it. Shall
we call it courage? Or shall we call it recklessness? Courage observes;
reflects; calculates; surveys the whole situation; counts the cost,
estimates the odds, makes up its mind; then goes at the enterprise
resolute to win or perish. Recklessness does not reflect, it plunges
fearlessly in with a hurrah, and takes the risks, whatever they may be,
regardless of expense. Recklessness often fails, Mrs. Eddy has never
failed–from the point of view of her followers. The point of view of
other people is naturally not a matter of weighty importance to her.</p>
<p>The new Church was not born loose-jointed and featureless, but had a
defined plan, a definite character, definite aims, and a name which was
a challenge, and defied all comers. It was “a Mind-healing Church.“ It
was “without a creed.“ Its name, “The Church of Christ, Scientist.“</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy could not copyright her Church, but she chartered it, which
was the same thing and relieved the pain. It had twenty-six charter
members. Mrs. Eddy was at once installed as its pastor.</p>
<p>The other venture, above referred to, was Mrs. Eddy’s Massachusetts
Metaphysical College, in which was taught “the pathology of spiritual
power.“ She could not copyright it, but she got it chartered. For
faculty it had herself, her husband of the period (Dr. Eddy), and her
adopted son, Dr. Foster-Eddy. The college term was “barely three weeks,“
she says. Again she was bold, brave, rash, reckless–choose for
yourself–for she not only began to charge the student, but charged him a
hundred dollars a week for the enlightenments. And got it? some may ask.
Easily. Pupils flocked from far and near. They came by the hundred.
Presently the term was cut down nearly half, but the price remained as
before. To be exact, the term-cut was to seven lessons –price, three
hundred dollars. The college “yielded a large income.“ This is
believable. In seven years Mrs. Eddy taught, as she avers, over four
thousand students in it. (Preface to 1902 edition of Science and
Health.) Three hundred times four thousand is–but perhaps you can cipher
it yourself. I could do it ordinarily, but I fell down yesterday and
hurt my leg. Cipher it; you will see that it is a grand sum for a woman
to earn in seven years. Yet that was not all she got out of her college
in the seven.</p>
<p>At the time that she was charging the primary student three hundred
dollars for twelve lessons she was not content with this tidy
assessment, but had other ways of plundering him. By advertisement she
offered him privileges whereby he could add eighteen lessons to his
store for five hundred dollars more. That is to say, he could get a
total of thirty lessons in her college for eight hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Four thousand times eight hundred is–but it is a difficult sum for a
cripple who has not been “demonstrated over“ to cipher; let it go. She
taught “over“ four thousand students in seven years. “Over“ is not
definite, but it probably represents a non-paying surplus of learners
over and above the paying four thousand. Charity students, doubtless. I
think that as interesting an advertisement as has been printed since the
romantic old days of the other buccaneers is this one from the Christian
Science Journal for September, 1886:</p>
<p>“MASSACHUSETTS METAPHYSICAL COLLEGE</p>
<p>“Rev. MARY BAKER G. EDDY, PRESIDENT</p>
<p>“571 Columbus Avenue, Boston</p>
<p>“The collegiate course in Christian Science metaphysical healing
includes twelve lessons. Tuition, three hundred dollars.</p>
<p>“Course in metaphysical obstetrics includes six daily lectures, and
is open only to students from this college. Tuition, one hundred
dollars.</p>
<p>“Class in theology, open (like the above) to graduates, receives six
additional lectures on the Scriptures, and summary of the principle and
practice of Christian Science, two hundred dollars.</p>
<p>“Normal class is open to those who have taken the first course at
this college; six daily lectures complete the Normal course. Tuition,
two hundred dollars.</p>
<p>“No invalids, and only persons of good moral character, are accepted
as students. All students are subject to examination and rejection; and
they are liable to leave the class if found unfit to remain in it.</p>
<p>“A limited number of clergymen received free of charge.</p>
<p>“Largest discount to indigent students, one hundred dollars on the
first course.</p>
<p>“No deduction on the others.</p>
<p>“Husband and wife, entered together, three hundred dollars.</p>
<p>“Tuition for all strictly in advance.“</p>
<p>There it is–the horse-leech’s daughter alive again, after a
three-century vacation. Fifty or sixty hours’ lecturing for eight
hundred dollars.</p>
<p>I was in error as to one matter: there are no charity students.
Gratis-taught clergymen must not be placed under that head; they are
merely an advertisement. Pauper students can get into the infant class
on a two-third rate (cash in advance), but not even an archangel can get
into the rest of the game at anything short of par, cash down. For it is
“in the spirit of Christ’s charity, as one who is joyful to hear healing
to the sick“ that Mrs. Eddy is working the game. She sends the healing
to them outside. She cannot bear it to them inside the college, for the
reason that she does not allow a sick candidate to get in. It is true
that this smells of inconsistency, but that is nothing; Mrs. Eddy would
not be Mrs. Eddy if she should ever chance to be consistent about
anything two days running.</p>
<p>Except in the matter of the Dollar. The Dollar, and appetite for
power and notoriety. English must also be added; she is always
consistent, she is always Mrs. Eddy, in her English: it is always and
consistently confused and crippled and poor. She wrote the
Advertisement; her literary trade-marks are there. When she says all
“students“ are subject to examination, she does not mean students, she
means candidates for that lofty place When she says students are
“liable“ to leave the class if found unfit to remain in it, she does not
mean that if they find themselves unfit, or be found unfit by others,
they will be likely to ask permission to leave the class; she means that
if she finds them unfit she will be “liable“ to fire them out. When she
nobly offers “tuition for all strictly in advance,“ she does not mean
“instruction for all in advance-payment for it later.“ No, that is only
what she says, it is not what she means. If she had written Science and
Health, the oldest man in the world would not be able to tell with
certainty what any passage in it was intended to mean.</p>
<p>Her Church was on its legs.</p>
<p>She was its pastor. It was prospering.</p>
<p>She was appointed one of a committee to draught By-laws for its
government. It may be observed, without overplus of irreverence, that
this was larks for her. She did all of the draughting herself. From the
very beginning she was always in the front seat when there was business
to be done; in the front seat, with both eyes open, and looking sharply
out for Number One; in the front seat, working Mortal Mind with fine
effectiveness and giving Immortal Mind a rest for Sunday. When her
Church was reorganized, by-and-by, the By-laws were retained. She saw to
that. In these Laws for the government of her Church, her empire, her
despotism, Mrs. Eddy’s character is embalmed for good and all. I think a
particularized examination of these Church-laws will be found
interesting. And not the less so if we keep in mind that they were
“impelled by a power not one’s own,“ as she says–Anglice. the
inspiration of God.</p>
<p>It is a Church “without a creed.“ Still, it has one. Mrs. Eddy
draughted it–and copyrighted it. In her own name. You cannot become a
member of the Mother-Church (nor of any Christian Science Church)
without signing it. It forms the first chapter of the By-laws, and is
called “Tenets.“ “Tenets of The Mother Church, The First Church of
Christ, Scientist.“ It has no hell in it–it throws it overboard.</p>
<p>THE PASTOR EMERITUS</p>
<p>About the time of the reorganization, Mrs. Eddy retired from her
position of pastor of her Church, abolished the office of pastor in all
branch Churches, and appointed her book, Science and Health, to be
pastor-universal. Mrs. Eddy did not disconnect herself from the office
entirely, when she retired, but appointed herself Pastor Emeritus. It is
a misleading title, and belongs to the family of that phrase “without a
creed.“ It advertises her as being a merely honorary official, with
nothing to do, and no authority. The Czar of Russia is Emperor Emeritus
on the same terms. Mrs. Eddy was Autocrat of the Church before, with
limitless authority, and she kept her grip on that limitless authority
when she took that fictitious title.</p>
<p>It is curious and interesting to note with what an unerring instinct
the Pastor Emeritus has thought out and forecast all possible
encroachments upon her planned autocracy, and barred the way against
them, in the By-laws which she framed and copyrighted–under the guidance
of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p>THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</p>
<p>For instance, when Article I. speaks of a President and Board of
Directors, you think you have discovered a formidable check upon the
powers and ambitions of the honorary pastor, the ornamental pastor, the
functionless pastor, the Pastor Emeritus, but it is a mistake. These
great officials are of the phrase–family of the Church-Without-a-Creed
and the Pastor-With-Nothing-to-Do; that is to say, of the family of
Large-Names-Which-Mean-Nothing. The Board is of so little consequence
that the By-laws do not state how it is chosen, nor who does it; but
they do state, most definitely, that the Board cannot fill a vacancy in
its number “except the candidate is approved by the Pastor
Emeritus.“</p>
<p>The “candidate.“ The Board cannot even proceed to an election until
the Pastor Emeritus has examined the list and squelched such candidates
as are not satisfactory to her.</p>
<p>Whether the original first Board began as the personal property of
Mrs. Eddy or not, it is foreseeable that in time, under this By-law, she
would own it. Such a first Board might chafe under such a rule as that,
and try to legislate it out of existence some day. But Mrs. Eddy was
awake. She foresaw that danger, and added this ingenious and effective
clause:</p>
<p>“This By-law can neither be amended nor annulled, except by consent
of Mrs. Eddy, the Pastor Emeritus“</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT</p>
<p>The Board of Directors, or Serfs, or Ciphers, elects the
President.</p>
<p>On these clearly worded terms: “Subject to the approval of the Pastor
Emeritus.“</p>
<p>Therefore She elects him.</p>
<p>A long term can invest a high official with influence and power, and
make him dangerous. Mrs. Eddy reflected upon that; so she limits the
President’s term to a year. She has a capable commercial head, an
organizing head, a head for government.</p>
<p>TREASURER AND CLERK</p>
<p>There are a Treasurer and a Clerk. They are elected by the Board of
Directors. That is to say, by Mrs. Eddy.</p>
<p>Their terms of office expire on the first Tuesday in June of each
year, “or upon the election of their successors.“ They must be
watchfully obedient and satisfactory to her, or she will elect and
install their successors with a suddenness that can be unpleasant to
them. It goes without saying that the Treasurer manages the Treasury to
suit Mrs. Eddy, and is in fact merely Temporary Deputy Treasurer.</p>
<p>Apparently the Clerk has but two duties to perform: to read messages
from Mrs. Eddy to First Members assembled in solemn Council, and provide
lists of candidates for Church membership. The select body entitled
First Members are the aristocracy of the Mother-Church, the Charter
Members, the Aborigines, a sort of stylish but unsalaried little College
of Cardinals, good for show, but not indispensable. Nobody is
indispensable in Mrs. Eddy’s empire; she sees to that.</p>
<p>When the Pastor Emeritus sends a letter or message to that little
Sanhedrin, it is the Clerk’s “imperative duty“ to read it “at the place
and time specified.“ Otherwise, the world might come to an end. These
are fine, large frills, and remind us of the ways of emperors and such.
Such do not use the penny-post, they send a gilded and painted special
messenger, and he strides into the Parliament, and business comes to a
sudden and solemn and awful stop; and in the impressive hush that
follows, the Chief Clerk reads the document. It is his “imperative
duty.“ If he should neglect it, his official life would end. It is the
same with this Mother-Church Clerk; “if he fail to perform this
important function of his office,“ certain majestic and unshirkable
solemnities must follow: a special meeting “shall“ be called; a member
of the Church “shall“ make formal complaint; then the Clerk “shall“ be
“removed from office.“ Complaint is sufficient, no trial is
necessary.</p>
<p>There is something very sweet and juvenile and innocent and pretty
about these little tinsel vanities, these grave apings of monarchical
fuss and feathers and ceremony, here on our ostentatiously democratic
soil. She is the same lady that we found in the Autobiography, who was
so naively vain of all that little ancestral military riffraff that she
had dug up and annexed. A person’s nature never changes. What it is in
childhood, it remains. Under pressure, or a change of interest, it can
partially or wholly disappear from sight, and for considerable stretches
of time, but nothing can ever permanently modify it, nothing can ever
remove it.</p>
<p>BOARD OF TRUSTEES</p>
<p>There isn’t any–now. But with power and money piling up higher and
higher every day and the Church’s dominion spreading daily wider and
farther, a time could come when the envious and ambitious could start
the idea that it would be wise and well to put a watch upon these assets
–a watch equipped with properly large authority. By custom, a Board of
Trustees. Mrs. Eddy has foreseen that probability–for she is a woman
with a long, long look ahead, the longest look ahead that ever a woman
had–and she has provided for that emergency. In Art. I., Sec. 5, she has
decreed that no Board of Trustees shall ever exist in the Mother-Church
“except it be constituted by the Pastor Emeritus.“</p>
<p>The magnificence of it, the daring of it! Thus far, she is:</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Metaphysical College; Pastor Emeritus; President;
Board of Directors; Treasurer; Clerk; and future Board of Trustees;</p>
<p>and is still moving onward, ever onward. When I contemplate her from
a commercial point of view, there are no words that can convey my
admiration of her.</p>
<p>READERS</p>
<p>These are a feature of first importance in the church-machinery of
Christian Science. For they occupy the pulpit. They hold the place that
the preacher holds in the other Christian Churches. They hold that
place, but they do not preach. Two of them are on duty at a time–a man
and a woman. One reads a passage from the Bible, the other reads the
explanation of it from Science and Health–and so they go on alternating.
This constitutes the service–this, with choir-music. They utter no word
of their own. Art. IV., Sec. 6, closes their mouths with this
uncompromising gag:</p>
<p>“They shall make no remarks explanatory of the Lesson-Sermon at any
time during the service.“</p>
<p>It seems a simple little thing. One is not startled by it at a first
reading of it; nor at the second, nor the third. One may have to read it
a dozen times before the whole magnitude of it rises before the mind. It
far and away oversizes and outclasses the best business-idea yet
invented for the safe-guarding and perpetuating of a religion. If it had
been thought of and put in force eighteen hundred and seventy years ago,
there would be but one Christian sect in the world now, instead of ten
dozens of them.</p>
<p>There are many varieties of men in the world, consequently there are
many varieties of minds in its pulpits. This insures many differing
interpretations of important Scripture texts, and this in turn insures
the splitting up of a religion into many sects. It is what has happened;
it was sure to happen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy has noted this disastrous result of preaching, and has put
up the bars. She will have no preaching in her Church. She has explained
all essential Scriptures, and set the explanations down in her book. In
her belief her underlings cannot improve upon those explanations, and in
that stern sentence “they shall make no explanatory remarks“ she has
barred them for all time from trying. She will be obeyed; there is no
question about that.</p>
<p>In arranging her government she has borrowed ideas from various
sources –not poor ones, but the best in the governmental market–but this
one is new, this one came out of no ordinary business-head, this one
must have come out of her own, there has been no other commercial skull
in a thousand centuries that was equal to it. She has borrowed freely
and wisely, but I am sure that this idea is many times larger than all
her borrowings bulked together. One must respect the business-brain that
produced it–the splendid pluck and impudence that ventured to promulgate
it, anyway.</p>
<p>ELECTION OF READERS</p>
<p>Readers are not taken at hap-hazard, any more than preachers are
taken at hap-hazard for the pulpits of other sects. No, Readers are
elected by the Board of Directors. But–</p>
<p>“Section 3. The Board shall inform the Pas. for Emeritus of the names
of candidates for Readers before they are elected, and if she objects to
the nomination, said candidates shall not be chosen.“</p>
<p>Is that an election–by the Board? Thus far I have not been able to
find out what that Board of Spectres is for. It certainly has no real
function, no duty which the hired girl could not perform, no office
beyond the mere recording of the autocrat’s decrees.</p>
<p>There are no dangerously long office-terms in Mrs. Eddy’s government.
The Readers are elected for but one year. This insures their
subserviency to their proprietor.</p>
<p>Readers are not allowed to copy out passages and read them from the
manuscript in the pulpit; they must read from Mrs. Eddy’s book itself.
She is right. Slight changes could be slyly made, repeated, and in time
get acceptance with congregations. Branch sects could grow out of these
practices. Mrs. Eddy knows the human race, and how far to trust it. Her
limit is not over a quarter of an inch. It is all that a wise person
will risk.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy’s inborn disposition to copyright everything, charter
everything, secure the rightful and proper credit to herself for
everything she does, and everything she thinks she does, and everything
she thinks, and everything she thinks she thinks or has thought or
intends to think, is illustrated in Sec. 5 of Art. IV., defining the
duties of official Readers–in church:</p>
<p>“Naming Book and Author. The Reader of Science and Health, with Key
to the Scriptures, before commencing to read from this book, shall
distinctly announce its full title and give the author’s name.“</p>
<p>Otherwise the congregation might get the habit of forgetting who
(ostensibly) wrote the book.</p>
<p>THE ARISTOCRACY</p>
<p>This consists of First Members and their apostolic succession. It is
a close corporation, and its membership limit is one hundred. Forty will
answer, but if the number fall below that, there must be an election, to
fill the grand quorum.</p>
<p>This Sanhedrin can’t do anything of the slightest importance, but it
can talk. It can “discuss.“ That is, it can discuss “important questions
relative to Church members“, evidently persons who are already Church
members. This affords it amusement, and does no harm.</p>
<p>It can “fix the salaries of the Readers.“</p>
<p>Twice a year it “votes on“ admitting candidates. That is, for Church
membership. But its work is cut out for it beforehand, by Art. IX.:</p>
<p>“Every recommendation for membership In the Church ‘shall be
countersigned by a loyal student of Mrs. Eddy’s, by a Director of this
Church, or by a First Member.’“</p>
<p>All these three classes of beings are the personal property of
Mrs. Eddy. She has absolute control of the elections.</p>
<p>Also it must “transact any Church business that may properly come
before it.“</p>
<p>“Properly“ is a thoughtful word. No important business can come
before it. The By laws have attended to that. No important business goes
before any one for the final word except Mrs. Eddy. She has looked to
that.</p>
<p>The Sanhedrin “votes on“ candidates for admission to its own body.
But is its vote worth any more than mine would be? No, it isn’t. Sec. 4,
of Art. V.–Election of First Members–makes this quite plain:</p>
<p>“Before being elected, the candidates for First Members shall be
approved by the Pastor Emeritus over her own signature.“</p>
<p>Thus the Sanhedrin is the personal property of Mrs. Eddy. She owns
it. It has no functions, no authority, no real existence. It is another
Board of Shadows. Mrs. Eddy is the Sanhedrin herself.</p>
<p>But it is time to foot up again and “see where we are at.“ Thus far,
Mrs. Eddy is</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Metaphysical College; Pastor Emeritus, President;
Board of Directors; Treasurer; Clerk; Future Board of Trustees;
Proprietor of the Priesthood: Dictator of the Services; Proprietor of
the Sanhedrin. She has come far, and is still on her way.</p>
<p>CHURCH MEMBERSHIP</p>
<p>In this Article there is another exhibition of a couple of the large
features of Mrs. Eddy’s remarkable make-up: her business-talent and her
knowledge of human nature.</p>
<p>She does not beseech and implore people to join her Church. She knows
the human race better than that. She gravely goes through the motions of
reluctantly granting admission to the applicant as a favor to him. The
idea is worth untold shekels. She does not stand at the gate of the fold
with welcoming arms spread, and receive the lost sheep with glad emotion
and set up the fatted calf and invite the neighbor and have a time. No,
she looks upon him coldly, she snubs him, she says:</p>
<p>“Who are you? Who is your sponsor? Who asked you to come here? Go
away, and don’t come again until you are invited.“</p>
<p>It is calculated to strikingly impress a person accustomed to Moody
and Sankey and Sam Jones revivals; accustomed to brain-turning appeals
to the unknown and unendorsed sinner to come forward and enter into the
joy, etc.–“just as he is“; accustomed to seeing him do it; accustomed to
seeing him pass up the aisle through sobbing seas of welcome, and love,
and congratulation, and arrive at the mourner’s bench and be received
like a long-lost government bond.</p>
<p>No, there is nothing of that kind in Mrs. Eddy’s system. She knows
that if you wish to confer upon a human being something which he is not
sure he wants, the best way is to make it apparently difficult for him
to get it–then he is no son of Adam if that apple does not assume an
interest in his eyes which it lacked before. In time this interest can
grow into desire. Mrs. Eddy knows that when you cannot get a man to
try–free of cost–a new and effective remedy for a disease he is
afflicted with, you can generally sell it to him if you will put a price
upon it which he cannot afford. When, in the beginning, she taught
Christian Science gratis (for good reasons), pupils were few and
reluctant, and required persuasion; it was when she raised the limit to
three hundred dollars for a dollar’s worth that she could not find
standing room for the invasion of pupils that followed.</p>
<p>With fine astuteness she goes through the motions of making it
difficult to get membership in her Church. There is a twofold value in
this system: it gives membership a high value in the eyes of the
applicant; and at the same time the requirements exacted enable
Mrs. Eddy to keep him out if she has doubts about his value to her. A
word further as to applications for membership:</p>
<p>“Applications of students of the Metaphysical College must be signed
by the Board of Directors.“</p>
<p>That is safe. Mrs. Eddy is proprietor of that Board.</p>
<p>Children of twelve may be admitted if invited by “one of Mrs. Eddy’s
loyal students, or by a First Member, or by a Director.“</p>
<p>These sponsors are the property of Mrs. Eddy, therefore her Church is
safeguarded from the intrusion of undesirable children.</p>
<p>Other Students. Applicants who have not studied with Mrs. Eddy can
get in only “by invitation and recommendation from students of
Mrs. Eddy…. or from members of the Mother-Church.“</p>
<p>Other paragraphs explain how two or three other varieties of
applicants are to be challenged and obstructed, and tell us who is
authorized to invite them, recommend them endorse them, and all
that.</p>
<p>The safeguards are definite, and would seem to be sufficiently
strenuous –to Mr. Sam Jones, at any rate. Not for Mrs. Eddy. She adds
this clincher:</p>
<p>“The candidates be elected by a majority vote of the First Members
present.“</p>
<p>That is the aristocracy, the aborigines, the Sanhedrin. It is
Mrs. Eddy’s property. She herself is the Sanhedrin. No one can get into
the Church if she wishes to keep him out.</p>
<p>This veto power could some time or other have a large value for her,
therefore she was wise to reserve it.</p>
<p>It is likely that it is not frequently used. It is also probable that
the difficulties attendant upon getting admission to membership have
been instituted more to invite than to deter, more to enhance the value
of membership and make people long for it than to make it really
difficult to get. I think so, because the Mother. Church has many
thousands of members more than its building can accommodate.</p>
<p>AND SOME ENGLISH REQUIRED</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is very particular as regards one detail curiously so, for
her, all things considered. The Church Readers must be “good English
scholars“; they must be “thorough English scholars.“</p>
<p>She is thus sensitive about the English of her subordinates for
cause, possibly. In her chapter defining the duties of the Clerk there
is an indication that she harbors resentful memories of an occasion when
the hazy quality of her own English made unforeseen and mortifying
trouble:</p>
<p>“Understanding Communications. Sec. 2. If the Clerk of this Church
shall receive a communication from the Pastor Emeritus which he does not
fully understand, he shall inform her of this fact before presenting it
to the Church, and obtain a clear understanding of the matter–then act
in accordance therewith.“</p>
<p>She should have waited to calm down, then, but instead she added
this, which lacks sugar:</p>
<p>“Failing to adhere to this By-law, the Clerk must resign.“</p>
<p>I wish I could see that communication that broke the camel’s back. It
was probably the one beginning: “What plague spot or bacilli were
gnawing at the heart of this metropolis and bringing it on bended knee?“
and I think it likely that the kindly disposed Clerk tried to translate
it into English and lost his mind and had to go to the hospital. That
Bylaw was not the offspring of a forecast, an intuition, it was
certainly born of a sorrowful experience. Its temper gives the fact
away.</p>
<p>The little book of By-laws has manifestly been tinkered by one of
Mrs. Eddy’s “thorough English scholars,“ for in the majority of cases
its meanings are clear. The book is not even marred by Mrs. Eddy’s
peculiar specialty–lumbering clumsinesses of speech. I believe the
salaried polisher has weeded them all out but one. In one place, after
referring to Science and Health, Mrs. Eddy goes on to say “the Bible and
the above-named book, with other works by the same author,“ etc.</p>
<p>It is an unfortunate sentence, for it could mislead a hasty or
careless reader for a moment. Mrs. Eddy framed it–it is her very own–it
bears her trade-mark. “The Bible and Science and Health, with other
works by the same author,“ could have come from no literary vacuum but
the one which produced the remark (in the Autobiography): “I remember
reading, in my childhood, certain manuscripts containing Scriptural
Sonnets, besides other verses and enigmas.“</p>
<p>We know what she means, in both instances, but a low-priced Clerk
would not necessarily know, and on a salary like his he could quite
excusably aver that the Pastor Emeritus had commanded him to come and
make proclamation that she was author of the Bible, and that she was
thinking of discharging some Scriptural sonnets and other enigmas upon
the congregation. It could lose him his place, but it would not be fair,
if it happened before the edict about “Understanding Communications“ was
promulgated.</p>
<p>“READERS“ AGAIN</p>
<p>The By-law book makes a showy pretence of orderliness and system, but
it is only a pretence. I will not go so far as to say it is a
harum-scarum jumble, for it is not that, but I think it fair to say it
is at least jumbulacious in places. For instance, Articles III. and IV.
set forth in much detail the qualifications and duties of Readers, she
then skips some thirty pages and takes up the subject again. It looks
like slovenliness, but it may be only art. The belated By-law has a
sufficiently quiet look, but it has a ton of dynamite in it. It makes
all the Christian Science Church Readers on the globe the personal
chattels of Mrs. Eddy. Whenever she chooses, she can stretch her long
arm around the world’s fat belly and flirt a Reader out of his pulpit,
though he be tucked away in seeming safety and obscurity in a lost
village in the middle of China:</p>
<p>“In any Church. Sec. 2. The Pastor Emeritus of the Mother-Church
shall have the right (through a letter addressed to the individual and
Church of which he is the Reader) to remove a Reader from this office in
any Church of Christ, Scientist, both in America and in foreign nations;
or to appoint the Reader to fill any office belonging to the Christian
Science denomination.“</p>
<p>She does not have to prefer charges against him, she does not have to
find him lazy, careless, incompetent, untidy, ill-mannered, unholy,
dishonest, she does not have to discover a fault of any kind in him, she
does not have to tell him nor his congregation why she dismisses and
disgraces him and insults his meek flock, she does not have to explain
to his family why she takes the bread out of their mouths and turns them
out-of-doors homeless and ashamed in a strange land; she does not have
to do anything but send a letter and say: “Pack!–and ask no
questions!“</p>
<p>Has the Pope this power?–the other Pope–the one in Rome. Has he
anything approaching it? Can he turn a priest out of his pulpit and
strip him of his office and his livelihood just upon a whim, a caprice,
and meanwhile furnishing no reasons to the parish? Not in America. And
not elsewhere, we may believe.</p>
<p>It is odd and strange, to see intelligent and educated people among
us worshipping this self-seeking and remorseless tyrant as a God. This
worship is denied–by persons who are themselves worshippers of
Mrs. Eddy. I feel quite sure that it is a worship which will continue
during ages.</p>
<p>That Mrs. Eddy wrote that amazing By-law with her own hand we have
much better evidence than her word. We have her English. It is there. It
cannot be imitated. She ought never to go to the expense of copyrighting
her verbal discharges. When any one tries to claim them she should call
me; I can always tell them from any other literary apprentice’s at a
glance. It was like her to call America a “nation“; she would call a
sand-bar a nation if it should fall into a sentence in which she was
speaking of peoples, for she would not know how to untangle it and get
it out and classify it by itself. And the closing arrangement of that
By-law is in true Eddysonian form, too. In it she reserves authority to
make a Reader fill any office connected with a Science church-sexton,
grave-digger, advertising-agent, Annex-polisher, leader of the choir,
President, Director, Treasurer, Clerk, etc. She did not mean that. She
already possessed that authority. She meant to clothe herself with
power, despotic and unchallengeable, to appoint all Science Readers to
their offices, both at home and abroad. The phrase “or to appoint“ is
another miscarriage of intention; she did not mean “or,“ she meant
“and.“</p>
<p>That By-law puts into Mrs. Eddy’s hands absolute command over the
most formidable force and influence existent in the Christian Science
kingdom outside of herself, and it does this unconditionally and (by
auxiliary force of Laws already quoted) irrevocably. Still, she is not
quite satisfied. Something might happen, she doesn’t know what.
Therefore she drives in one more nail, to make sure, and drives it
deep:</p>
<p>“This By-law can neither be amended nor annulled, except by consent
of the Pastor Emeritus.“</p>
<p>Let some one with a wild and delirious fancy try and see if he can
imagine her furnishing that consent.</p>
<p>MONOPOLY OF SPIRITUAL BREAD</p>
<p>Very properly, the first qualification for membership in the
Mother-Church is belief in the doctrines of Christian Science.</p>
<p>But these doctrines must not be gathered from secondary sources.
There is but one recognized source. The candidate must be a believer in
the doctrines of Christian Science “according to the platform and
teaching contained in the Christian Science text-book, ‘Science and
Health, with Key to the Scriptures,’ by Rev. Mary Baker G. Eddy.“</p>
<p>That is definite, and is final. There are to be no commentaries, no
labored volumes of exposition and explanation by anybody except
Mrs. Eddy. Because such things could sow error, create warring opinions,
split the religion into sects, and disastrously cripple its power.
Mrs. Eddy will do the whole of the explaining, Herself–has done it, in
fact. She has written several books. They are to be had (for cash in
advance), they are all sacred; additions to them can never be needed and
will never be permitted. They tell the candidate how to instruct
himself, how to teach others, how to do all things comprised in the
business–and they close the door against all would-be competitors, and
monopolize the trade:</p>
<p>“The Bible and the above–named book [Science and Health], with other
works by the same author,“ must be his only text-books for the commerce
–he cannot forage outside.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy’s words are to be the sole elucidators of the Bible and
Science and Health–forever. Throughout the ages, whenever there is doubt
as to the meaning of a passage in either of these books the inquirer
will not dream of trying to explain it to himself; he would shudder at
the thought of such temerity, such profanity, he would be haled to the
Inquisition and thence to the public square and the stake if he should
be caught studying into text-meanings on his own hook; he will be
prudent and seek the meanings at the only permitted source, Mrs. Eddy’s
commentaries.</p>
<p>Value of this Strait-jacket. One must not underrate the magnificence
of this long-headed idea, one must not underestimate its giant
possibilities in the matter of trooping the Church solidly together and
keeping it so. It squelches independent inquiry, and makes such a thing
impossible, profane, criminal, it authoritatively settles every dispute
that can arise. It starts with finality–a point which the Roman Church
has travelled towards fifteen or sixteen centuries, stage by stage, and
has not yet reached. The matter of the Immaculate Conception of the
Virgin Mary was not authoritatively settled until the days of Pius IX.
–yesterday, so to speak.</p>
<p>As already noticed, the Protestants are broken up into a long array
of sects, a result of disputes about the meanings of texts, disputes
made unavoidable by the absence of an infallible authority to submit
doubtful passages to. A week or two ago (I am writing in the middle of
January, 1903), the clergy and others hereabouts had a warm dispute in
the papers over this question: Did Jesus anywhere claim to be God? It
seemed an easy question, but it turned out to be a hard one. It was ably
and elaborately discussed, by learned men of several denominations, but
in the end it remained unsettled.</p>
<p>A week ago, another discussion broke out. It was over this text:</p>
<p>“Sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor.“</p>
<p>One verdict was worded as follows:</p>
<p>“When Christ answered the rich young man and said for him to give to
the poor all he possessed or he could not gain everlasting life, He did
not mean it in the literal sense. My interpretation of His words is that
we should part with what comes between us and Christ.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that Jesus believed that the rich young man
thought more of his wealth than he did of his soul, and, such being the
case, it was his duty to give up the wealth.</p>
<p>“Every one of us knows that there is something we should give up for
Christ. Those who are true believers and followers know what they have
given up, and those who are not yet followers know down in their hearts
what they must give up.“</p>
<p>Ten clergymen of various denominations were interviewed, and nine of
them agreed with that verdict. That did not settle the matter, because
the tenth said the language of Jesus was so strait and definite that it
explained itself: “Sell all,“ not a percentage.</p>
<p>There is a most unusual feature about that dispute: the nine persons
who decided alike, quoted not a single authority in support of their
position. I do not know when I have seen trained disputants do the like
of that before. The nine merely furnished their own opinions, founded
upon–nothing at all. In the other dispute (“Did Jesus anywhere claim to
be God?“) the same kind of men–trained and learned clergymen–backed up
their arguments with chapter and verse. On both sides. Plenty of verses.
Were no reinforcing verses to be found in the present case? It looks
that way.</p>
<p>The opinion of the nine seems strange to me, for it is unsupported by
authority, while there was at least constructive authority for the
opposite view.</p>
<p>It is hair-splitting differences of opinion over disputed
text-meanings that have divided into many sects a once united Church.
One may infer from some of the names in the following list that some of
the differences are very slight–so slight as to be not distinctly
important, perhaps –yet they have moved groups to withdraw from
communions to which they belonged and set up a sect of their own. The
list–accompanied by various Church statistics for 1902, compiled by
Rev. Dr. H. K. Carroll–was published, January 8, 1903, in the New York
Christian Advocate:</p>
<p>Adventists (6 bodies), Baptists (13 bodies), Brethren (Plymouth) (4
bodies), Brethren (River) (3 bodies), Catholics (8 bodies), Catholic
Apostolic, Christadelphians, Christian Connection, Christian Catholics,
Christian Missionary Association, Christian Scientists, Church of God
(Wine-brennarian), Church of the New Jerusalem, Congregationalists,
Disciples of Christ, Dunkards (4 bodies), Evangelical (2 bodies),
Friends (4 bodies), Friends of the Temple, German Evangelical
Protestant, German Evangelical Synod, Independent congregations, Jews (2
bodies), Latter-day Saints (2 bodies), Lutherans (22 bodies), Mennonites
(12 bodies), Methodists (17 bodies), Moravians, Presbyterians (12
bodies), Protestant Episcopal (2 bodies), Reformed (3 bodies),
Schwenkfeldians, Social Brethren, Spiritualists, Swedish Evangelical
Miss. Covenant (Waldenstromians), Unitarians, United Brethren (2
bodies), Universalists,</p>
<p>Total of sects and splits–139.</p>
<p>In the present month (February), Mr. E. I. Lindh, A..M., has
communicated to the Boston Transcript a hopeful article on the solution
of the problem of the “divided church.“ Divided is not too violent a
term. Subdivided could have been permitted if he had thought of it. He
came near thinking of it, for he mentions some of the subdivisions
himself: “the 12 kinds of Presbyterians, the 17 kinds of Methodists, the
13 kinds of Baptists, etc.“ He overlooked the 12 kinds of Mennonites and
the 22 kinds of Lutherans, but they are in Rev. Mr. Carroll’s list.
Altogether, 76 splits under 5 flags. The Literary Digest (February 14th)
is pleased with Mr. Lindh’s optimistic article, and also with the signs
of the times, and perceives that “the idea of Church unity is in the
air.“</p>
<p>Now, then, is not Mrs. Eddy profoundly wise in forbidding, for all
time, all explanations of her religion except such as she shall let on
to be her own?</p>
<p>I think so. I think there can be no doubt of it. In a way, they will
be her own; for, no matter which member of her clerical staff shall
furnish the explanations, not a line of them will she ever allow to be
printed until she shall have approved it, accepted it, copyrighted it,
cabbaged it. We may depend on that with a four-ace confidence.</p>
<p>THE NEW INFALLIBILITY</p>
<p>All in proper time Mrs. Eddy’s factory will take hold of that
Commandment, and explain it for good and all. It may be that one member
of the shift will vote that the word “all“ means all; it may be that ten
members of the shift will vote that “all“ means only a percentage; but
it is Mrs. Eddy, not the eleven, who will do the deciding. And if she
says it is percentage, then percentage it is, forevermore–and that is
what I am expecting, for she doesn’t sell all herself, nor any
considerable part of it, and as regards the poor, she doesn’t declare
any dividend; but if she says “all“ means all, then all it is, to the
end of time, and no follower of hers will ever be allowed to reconstruct
that text, or shrink it, or inflate it, or meddle with it in any way at
all. Even to-day –right here in the beginning–she is the sole person
who, in the matter of Christian Science exegesis, is privileged to
exploit the Spiral Twist. The Christian world has two Infallibles
now.</p>
<p>Of equal power? For the present only. When Leo XIII. passes to his
rest another Infallible will ascend his throne; others, and yet others,
and still others will follow him, and be as infallible as he, and decide
questions of doctrine as long as they may come up, all down the far
future; but Mary Baker G. Eddy is the only Infallible that will ever
occupy the Science throne. Many a Science Pope will succeed her, but she
has closed their mouths; they will repeat and reverently praise and
adore her infallibilities, but venture none themselves. In her grave she
will still outrank all other Popes, be they of what Church they may. She
will hold the supremest of earthly titles, The Infallible–with a capital
T. Many in the world’s history have had a hunger for such nuggets and
slices of power as they might reasonably hope to grab out of an empire’s
or a religion’s assets, but Mrs. Eddy is the only person alive or dead
who has ever struck for the whole of them. For small things she has the
eye of a microscope, for large ones the eye of a telescope, and whatever
she sees, she wants. Wants it all.</p>
<p>THE SACRED POEMS</p>
<p>When Mrs. Eddy’s “sacred revelations“ (that is the language of the
By-laws) are read in public, their authorship must be named. The By-laws
twice command this, therefore we mention it twice, to be fair.</p>
<p>But it is also commanded that when a member publicly quotes “from the
poems of our Pastor Emeritus“ the authorship shall be named. For these
are sacred, too. There are kindly people who may suspect a hidden
generosity in that By-law; they may think it is there to protect the
Official Reader from the suspicion of having written the poems himself.
Such do not know Mrs. Eddy. She does an inordinate deal of protecting,
but in no distinctly named and specified case in her history has Number
Two been the object of it. Instances have been claimed, but they have
failed of proof, and even of plausibility.</p>
<p>“Members shall also instruct their students“ to look out and
advertise the authorship when they read those poems and things. Not on
Mrs. Eddy’s account, but “for the good of our Cause.“</p>
<p>THE CHURCH EDIFICE</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mrs. Eddy gave the land. It was not of much value at the time, but
it is very valuable now. 2. Her people built the Mother-Church edifice
on it, at a cost of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 3. Then they
gave the whole property to her. 4. Then she gave it to the Board of
Directors. She is the Board of Directors. She took it out of one pocket
and put it in the other. 5. Sec. 10 (of the deed). “Whenever said
Directors shall determine that it is inexpedient to maintain preaching,
reading, or speaking in said church in accordance with the terms of this
deed, they are authorized and required to reconvey forthwith said lot of
land with the building thereon to Mary Baker G. Eddy, her heirs and
assigns forever, by a proper deed of conveyance.“</li>
</ol>
<p>She is never careless, never slipshod, about a matter of business.
Owning the property through her Board of Waxworks was safe enough, still
it was sound business to set another grip on it to cover accidents, and
she did it. Her barkers (what a curious name; I wonder if it is
copyrighted); her barkers persistently advertise to the public her
generosity in giving away a piece of land which cost her a trifle, and a
two–hundred–and–fifty–thousand–dollar church which cost her nothing; and
they can hardly speak of the unselfishness of it without breaking down
and crying; yet they know she gave nothing away, and never intended to.
However, such is the human race. Often it does seem such a pity that
Noah and his party did not miss the boat.</p>
<p>Some of the hostiles think that Mrs. Eddy’s idea in protecting this
property in the interest of her heirs, and in accumulating a great money
fortune, is, that she may leave her natural heirs well provided for when
she goes. I think it is a mistake. I think she is of late years giving
herself large concern about only one interest-her power and glory, and
the perpetuation and worship of her Name–with a capital N. Her Church is
her pet heir, and I think it will get her wealth. It is the torch which
is to light the world and the ages with her glory.</p>
<p>I think she once prized money for the ease and comfort it could
bring, the showy vanities it could furnish, and the social promotion it
could command; for we have seen that she was born into the world with
little ways and instincts and aspirations and affectations that are
duplicates of our own. I do not think her money-passion has ever
diminished in ferocity, I do not think that she has ever allowed a
dollar that had no friends to get by her alive, but I think her reason
for wanting it has changed. I think she wants it now to increase and
establish and perpetuate her power and glory with, not to add to her
comforts and luxuries, not to furnish paint and fuss and feathers for
vain display. I think her ambitions have soared away above the
fuss-and-feather stage. She still likes the little shows and vanities–a
fact which she exposed in a public utterance two or three days ago when
she was not noticing –but I think she does not place a large value upon
them now. She could build a mighty and far-shining brass-mounted palace
if she wanted to, but she does not do it. She would have had that kind
of an ambition in the early scrabbling times. She could go to England
to-day and be worshiped by earls, and get a comet’s attention from the
million, if she cared for such things. She would have gone in the early
scrabbling days for much less than an earl, and been vain of it, and
glad to show off before the remains of the Scotch kin. But those things
are very small to her now –next to invisible, observed through the
cloud-rack from the dizzy summit where she perches in these great days.
She does not want that church property for herself. It is worth but a
quarter of a million–a sum she could call in from her far-spread flocks
to-morrow with a lift of her hand. Not a squeeze of it, just a lift. It
would come without a murmur; come gratefully, come gladly. And if her
glory stood in more need of the money in Boston than it does where her
flocks are propagating it, she would lift the hand, I think.</p>
<p>She is still reaching for the Dollar, she will continue to reach for
it; but not that she may spend it upon herself; not that she may spend
it upon charities; not that she may indemnify an early deprivation and
clothe herself in a blaze of North Adams gauds; not that she may have
nine breeds of pie for breakfast, as only the rich New-Englander can;
not that she may indulge any petty material vanity or appetite that once
was hers and prized and nursed, but that she may apply that Dollar to
statelier uses, and place it where it may cast the metallic sheen of her
glory farthest across the receding expanses of the globe.</p>
<p>PRAYER</p>
<p>A brief and good one is furnished in the book of By-laws. The
Scientist is required to pray it every day.</p>
<p>THE LORD’S PRAYER-AMENDED</p>
<p>This is not in the By-laws, it is in the first chapter of Science and
Health, edition of 1902. I do not find it in the edition of 1884. It is
probable that it had not at that time been handed down. Science and
Health’s (latest) rendering of its “spiritual sense“ is as follows:</p>
<p>“Our Father-Mother God’ all-harmonious, adorable One. Thy kingdom is
within us, Thou art ever-present. Enable us to know–as in heaven, so on
earth–God is supreme. Give us grace for to-day; feed the famished
affections. And infinite Love is reflected in love. And Love leadeth us
not into temptation, but delivereth from sin, disease, and death. For
God is now and forever all Life, Truth, and Love.“</p>
<p>If I thought my opinion was desired and would be properly revered, I
should say that in my judgment that is as good a piece of carpentering
as any of those eleven Commandment–experts could do with the material
after all their practice. I notice only one doubtful place. “Lead us not
into temptation“ seems to me to be a very definite request, and that the
new rendering turns the definite request into a definite assertion. I
shall be glad to have that turned back to the old way and the marks of
the Spiral Twist removed, or varnished over; then I shall be satisfied,
and will do the best I can with what is left. At the same time, I do
feel that the shrinkage in our spiritual assets is getting serious.
First the Commandments, now the Prayer. I never expected to see these
steady old reliable securities watered down to this. And this is not the
whole of it. Last summer the Presbyterians extended the Calling and
Election suffrage to nearly everybody entitled to salvation. They did
not even stop there, but let out all the unbaptized American infants we
had been accumulating for two hundred years and more. There are some
that believe they would have let the Scotch ones out, too, if they could
have done it. Everything is going to ruin; in no long time we shall have
nothing left but the love of God.</p>
<p>THE NEW UNPARDONABLE SIN</p>
<p>“Working Against the Cause. Sec. 2. If a member of this Church shall
work against the accomplishment of what the Discoverer and Founder of
Christian Science understands is advantageous to the individual, to this
Church, and to the Cause of Christian Science“–out he goes. Forever.</p>
<p>The member may think that what he is doing will advance the Cause,
but he is not invited to do any thinking. More than that, he is not
permitted to do any–as he will clearly gather from this By-law. When a
person joins Mrs. Eddy’s Church he must leave his thinker at home. Leave
it permanently. To make sure that it will not go off some time or other
when he is not watching, it will be safest for him to spike it. If he
should forget himself and think just once, the By-law provides that he
shall be fired out-instantly-forever-no return.</p>
<p>“It shall be the duty of this Church immediately to call a meeting,
and drop forever the name of this member from its records.“</p>
<p>My, but it breathes a towering indignation!</p>
<p>There are forgivable offenses, but this is not one of them; there are
admonitions, probations, suspensions, in several minor cases; mercy is
shown the derelict, in those cases he is gently used, and in time he can
get back into the fold–even when he has repeated his offence. But let
him think, just once, without getting his thinker set to Eddy time, and
that is enough; his head comes off. There is no second offence, and
there is no gate open to that lost sheep, ever again.</p>
<p>“This rule cannot be changed, amended, or annulled, except by
unanimous vote of all the First Members.“</p>
<p>The same being Mrs. Eddy. It is naively sly and pretty to see her
keep putting forward First Members, and Boards of This and That, and
other broideries and ruffles of her raiment, as if they were independent
entities, instead of a part of her clothes, and could do things all by
themselves when she was outside of them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy did not need to copyright the sentence just quoted, its
English would protect it. None but she would have shovelled that
comically superfluous “all“ in there.</p>
<p>The former Unpardonable Sin has gone out of service. We may frame the
new Christian Science one thus:</p>
<p>“Whatsoever Member shall think, and without Our Mother’s permission
act upon his think, the same shall be cut off from the Church
forever.“</p>
<p>It has been said that I make many mistakes about Christian Science
through being ignorant of the spiritual meanings of its terminology. I
believe it is true. I have been misled all this time by that word
Member, because there was no one to tell me that its spiritual meaning
was Slave.</p>
<p>AXE AND BLOCK</p>
<p>There is a By-law which forbids Members to practice hypnotism; the
penalty is excommunication.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If a member is found to be a mental practitioner– 2. Complaint is to
be entered against him– 3. By the Pastor Emeritus, and by none else; 4.
No member is allowed to make complaint to her in the matter; 5. Upon
Mrs. Eddy’s mere “complaint“–unbacked by evidence or proof, and without
giving the accused a chance to be heard–his name shall be dropped from
this Church.“</li>
</ol>
<p>Mrs. Eddy has only to say a member is guilty–that is all. That ends
it. It is not a case of he “may“ be cut off from Christian Science
salvation, it is a case of he “shall“ be. Her serfs must see to it, and
not say a word.</p>
<p>Does the other Pope possess this prodigious and irresponsible power?
Certainly not in our day.</p>
<p>Some may be curious to know how Mrs. Eddy finds out that a member is
practicing hypnotism, since no one is allowed to come before her throne
and accuse him. She has explained this in Christian Science History,
first and second editions, page 16:</p>
<p>“I possess a spiritual sense of what the malicious mental
practitioner is mentally arguing which cannot be deceived; I can discern
in the human mind thoughts, motives, and purposes, and neither mental
arguments nor psychic power can affect this spiritual insight.“</p>
<p>A marvelous woman; with a hunger for power such as has never been
seen in the world before. No thing, little or big, that contains any
seed or suggestion of power escapes her avaricious eye; and when once
she gets that eye on it, her remorseless grip follows. There isn’t a
Christian Scientist who isn’t ecclesiastically as much her property as
if she had bought him and paid for him, and copyrighted him and got a
charter. She cannot be satisfied when she has handcuffed a member, and
put a leg-chain and ball on him and plugged his ears and removed his
thinker, she goes on wrapping needless chains round and round him, just
as a spider would. For she trusts no one, believes in no one’s honesty,
judges every one by herself. Although we have seen that she has absolute
and irresponsible command over her spectral Boards and over every
official and servant of her Church, at home and abroad, over every
minute detail of her Church’s government, present and future, and can
purge her membership of guilty or suspected persons by various plausible
formalities and whenever she will, she is still not content, but must
set her queer mind to work and invent a way by which she can take a
member–any member–by neck and crop and fling him out without anything
resembling a formality at all.</p>
<p>She is sole accuser and sole witness, and her testimony is final and
carries uncompromising and irremediable doom with it.</p>
<p>The Sole-Witness Court! It should make the Council of Ten and the
Council of Three turn in their graves for shame, to see how little they
knew about satanic concentrations of irresponsible power. Here we have
one Accuser, one Witness, one Judge, one Headsman–and all four bunched
together in Mrs. Eddy, the Inspired of God, His Latest Thought to His
People, New Member of the Holy Family, the Equal of Jesus.</p>
<p>When a Member is not satisfactory to Mrs. Eddy, and yet is blameless
in his life and faultless in his membership and in his Christian Science
walk and conversation, shall he hold up his head and tilt his hat over
one ear and imagine himself safe because of these perfections? Why, in
that very moment Mrs. Eddy will cast that spiritual X-ray of hers
through his dungarees and say:</p>
<p>“I see his hypnotism working, among his insides–remove him to the
block!“</p>
<p>What shall it profit him to know it isn’t so? Nothing. His testimony
is of no value. No one wants it, no one will ask for it. He is not
present to offer it (he does not know he has been accused), and if he
were there to offer it, it would not be listened to.</p>
<p>It was out of powers approaching Mrs. Eddy’s–though not equalling
them –that the Inquisition and the devastations of the Interdict grew.
She will transmit hers. The man born two centuries from now will think
he has arrived in hell; and all in good time he will think he knows it.
Vast concentrations of irresponsible power have never in any age been
used mercifully, and there is nothing to suggest that the Christian
Science Papacy is going to spend money on novelties.</p>
<p>Several Christian Scientists have asked me to refrain from prophecy.
There is no prophecy in our day but history. But history is a
trustworthy prophet. History is always repeating itself, because
conditions are always repeating themselves. Out of duplicated conditions
history always gets a duplicate product.</p>
<p>READING LETTERS AT MEETINGS</p>
<p>I wonder if there is anything a Member can do that will not raise
Mrs. Eddy’s jealousy? The By-laws seem to hunt him from pillar to post
all the time, and turn all his thoughts and acts and words into sins
against the meek and lowly new deity of his worship. Apparently her
jealousy never sleeps. Apparently any trifle can offend it, and but one
penalty appease it–excommunication. The By-laws might properly and
reasonably be entitled Laws for the Coddling and Comforting of Our
Mother’s Petty Jealousies. The By-law named at the head of this
paragraph reads its transgressor out of the Church if he shall carry a
letter from Mrs. Eddy to the congregation and forget to read it or fail
to read the whole of it.</p>
<p>HONESTY REQUISITE</p>
<p>Dishonest members are to be admonished; if they continue in dishonest
practices, excommunication follows. Considering who it is that draughted
this law, there is a certain amount of humor in it.</p>
<p>FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF THE AXE</p>
<p>Here follow the titles of some more By-laws whose infringement is
punishable by excommunication:</p>
<p>Silence Enjoined. Misteaching. Departure from Tenets. Violation of
Christian Fellowship. Moral Offences. Illegal Adoption. Broken By-laws.
Violation of By-laws. (What is the difference?) Formulas Forbidden.
Official Advice. (Forbids Tom, Dick, and Harry’s clack.) Unworthy of
Membership. Final Excommunication. Organizing Churches.</p>
<p>This looks as if Mrs. Eddy had devoted a large share of her time and
talent to inventing ways to get rid of her Church members. Yet in
another place she seems to invite membership. Not in any urgent way, it
is true, still she throws out a bait to such as like notice and
distinction (in other words, the Human Race). Page 82:</p>
<p>“It is important that these seemingly strict conditions be complied
with, as the names of the Members of the Mother-Church will be recorded
in the history of the Church and become a part thereof.“</p>
<p>We all want to be historical.</p>
<p>MORE SELF-PROTECTIONS</p>
<p>The Hymnal. There is a Christian Science Hymnal. Entrance to it was
closed in 1898. Christian Science students who make hymns nowadays may
possibly get them sung in the Mother-Church, “but not unless approved by
the Pastor Emeritus.“ Art. XXVII, Sec. 2.</p>
<p>Solo Singers. Mrs. Eddy has contributed the words of three of the
hymns in the Hymnal. Two of them appear in it six times altogether, each
of them being set to three original forms of musical anguish. Mrs. Eddy,
always thoughtful, has promulgated a By-law requiring the singing of one
of her three hymns in the Mother Church “as often as once each month.“
It is a good idea. A congregation could get tired of even Mrs. Eddy’s
muse in the course of time, without the cordializing incentive of
compulsion. We all know how wearisome the sweetest and touchingest
things can become, through rep-rep-repetition, and still
rep-rep-repetition, and more rep-rep-repetition-like “the sweet
by-and-by, in the sweet by-and-by,“ for instance, and “Tah-rah-rah
boom-de-aye“; and surely it is not likely that Mrs. Eddy’s machine has
turned out goods that could outwear those great heart-stirrers, without
the assistance of the lash. “O’er Waiting Harpstrings of the Mind“ is
pretty good, quite fair to middling–the whole seven of the stanzas–but
repetition would be certain to take the excitement out of it in the
course of time, even if there were fourteen, and then it would sound
like the multiplication table, and would cease to save. The congregation
would be perfectly sure to get tired; in fact, did get tired–hence the
compulsory By-law. It is a measure born of experience, not
foresight.</p>
<p>The By-laws say that “if a solo singer shall neglect or refuse to
sing alone“ one of those three hymns as often as once a month, and
oftener if so directed by the Board of Directors–which is Mrs. Eddy–the
singer’s salary shall be stopped. It is circumstantial evidence that
some soloists neglected this sacrament and others refused it. At least
that is the charitable view to take of it. There is only one other view
to take: that Mrs. Eddy did really foresee that there would be singers
who would some day get tired of doing her hymns and proclaiming the
authorship, unless persuaded by a Bylaw, with a penalty attached. The
idea could of course occur to her wise head, for she would know that a
seven-stanza break might well be a calamitous strain upon a soloist, and
that he might therefore avoid it if unwatched. He could not curtail it,
for the whole of anything that Mrs. Eddy does is sacred, and cannot be
cut.</p>
<p>BOARD OF EDUCATION</p>
<p>It consists of four members, one of whom is President of it. Its
members are elected annually. Subject to Mrs. Eddy’s approval. Art.
XXX., Sec. 2.</p>
<p>She owns the Board–is the Board.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is President of the Metaphysical College. If at any time
she shall vacate that office, the Directors of the College (that is to
say, Mrs. Eddy) “shall“ elect to the vacancy the President of the Board
of Education (which is merely re-electing herself).</p>
<p>It is another case of “Pastor Emeritus.“ She gives up the shadow of
authority, but keeps a good firm hold on the substance.</p>
<p>PUBLIC TEACHERS</p>
<p>Applicants for admission to this industry must pass a thorough three
days’ examination before the Board of Education “in Science and Health,
chapter on ‘Recapitulation’; the Platform of Christian Science; page 403
of Christian Science Practice, from line second to the second paragraph
of page 405; and page 488, second and third paragraphs.“</p>
<p>BOARD OF LECTURESHIP</p>
<p>The lecturers are exceedingly important servants of Mrs. Eddy, and
she chooses them with great care. Each of them has an appointed
territory in which to perform his duties–in the North, the South, the
East, the West, in Canada, in Great Britain, and so on–and each must
stick to his own territory and not forage beyond its boundaries. I think
it goes without saying–from what we have seen of Mrs. Eddy–that no
lecture is delivered until she has examined and approved it, and that
the lecturer is not allowed to change it afterwards.</p>
<p>The members of the Board of Lectureship are elected annually–</p>
<p>“Subject to the approval of Rev. Mary Baker G. Eddy.“</p>
<p>MISSIONARIES</p>
<p>There are but four. They are elected–like the rest of the domestics
–annually. So far as I can discover, not a single servant of the Sacred
Household has a steady job except Mrs. Eddy. It is plain that she trusts
no human being but herself.</p>
<p>THE BY-LAWS</p>
<p>The branch Churches are strictly forbidden to use them.</p>
<p>So far as I can see, they could not do it if they wanted to. The
By-laws are merely the voice of the master issuing commands to the
servants. There is nothing and nobody for the servants to re-utter them
to.</p>
<p>That useless edict is repeated in the little book, a few pages
farther on. There are several other repetitions of prohibitions in the
book that could be spared-they only take up room for nothing.</p>
<p>THE CREED It is copyrighted. I do not know why, but I suppose it is
to keep adventurers from some day claiming that they invented it, and
not Mrs. Eddy and that “strange Providence“ that has suggested so many
clever things to her.</p>
<p>No Change. It is forbidden to change the Creed. That is important, at
any rate.</p>
<p>COPYRIGHT</p>
<p>I can understand why Mrs. Eddy copyrighted the early editions and
revisions of Science and Health, and why she had a mania for
copyrighting every scrap of every sort that came from her pen in those
jejune days when to be in print probably seemed a wonderful distinction
to her in her provincial obscurity, but why she should continue this
delirium in these days of her godship and her far-spread fame, I cannot
explain to myself. And particularly as regards Science and Health. She
knows, now, that that Annex is going to live for many centuries; and so,
what good is a fleeting forty-two-year copyright going to do it?</p>
<p>Now a perpetual copyright would be quite another matter. I would like
to give her a hint. Let her strike for a perpetual copyright on that
book. There is precedent for it. There is one book in the world which
bears the charmed life of perpetual copyright (a fact not known to
twenty people in the world). By a hardy perversion of privilege on the
part of the lawmaking power the Bible has perpetual copyright in Great
Britain. There is no justification for it in fairness, and no
explanation of it except that the Church is strong enough there to have
its way, right or wrong. The recent Revised Version enjoys perpetual
copyright, too–a stronger precedent, even, than the other one.</p>
<p>Now, then, what is the Annex but a Revised Version itself? Which of
course it is–Lord’s Prayer and all. With that pair of formidable British
precedents to proceed upon, what Congress of ours–</p>
<p>But how short-sighted I am. Mrs. Eddy has thought of it long ago. She
thinks of everything. She knows she has only to keep her copyright of
1902 alive through its first stage of twenty-eight years, and perpetuity
is assured. A Christian Science Congress will reign in the Capitol then.
She probably attaches small value to the first edition (1875). Although
it was a Revelation from on high, it was slim, lank, incomplete, padded
with bales of refuse rags, and puffs from lassoed celebrities to fill it
out, an uncreditable book, a book easily sparable, a book not to be
mentioned in the same year with the sleek, fat, concise, compact,
compressed, and competent Annex of to-day, in its dainty flexible
covers, gilt–edges, rounded corners, twin screw, spiral twist,
compensation balance, Testament-counterfeit, and all that; a book just
born to curl up on the hymn-book-shelf in church and look just too sweet
and holy for anything. Yes, I see now what she was copyrighting that
child for.</p>
<p>CHRISTIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>It is true in matters of business Mrs. Eddy thinks of everything. She
thought of an organ, to disseminate the Truth as it was in Mrs. Eddy.
Straightway she started one–the Christian Science Journal.</p>
<p>It is true–in matters of business Mrs. Eddy thinks of everything. As
soon as she had got the Christian Science Journal sufficiently in debt
to make its presence on the premises disagreeable to her, it occurred to
her to make somebody a present of it. Which she did, along with its
debts. It was in the summer of 1889. The victim selected was her Church
–called, in those days, The National Christian Scientist
Association.</p>
<p>She delivered this sorrow to those lambs as a “gift“ in consideration
of their “loyalty to our great cause.“</p>
<p>Also–still thinking of everything–she told them to retain Mr. Bailey
in the editorship and make Mr. Nixon publisher. We do not know what it
was she had against those men; neither do we know whether she scored on
Bailey or not, we only know that God protected Nixon, and for that I am
sincerely glad, although I do not know Nixon and have never even seen
him.</p>
<p>Nixon took the Journal and the rest of the Publishing Society’s
liabilities, and demonstrated over them during three years, then brought
in his report:</p>
<p>“On assuming my duties as publisher, there was not a dollar in the
treasury; but on the contrary the Society owed unpaid printing and paper
bills to the amount of several hundred dollars, not to mention a
contingent liability of many more hundreds“–represented by advance
–subscriptions paid for the Journal and the “Series,“ the which goods
Mrs. Eddy had not delivered. And couldn’t, very well, perhaps, on a
Metaphysical College income of but a few thousand dollars a day, or a
week, or whatever it was in those magnificently flourishing times. The
struggling Journal had swallowed up those advance-payments, but its
“claim“ was a severe one and they had failed to cure it. But Nixon cured
it in his diligent three years, and joyously reported the news that he
had cleared off all the debts and now had a fat six thousand dollars in
the bank.</p>
<p>It made Mrs. Eddy’s mouth water.</p>
<p>At the time that Mrs. Eddy had unloaded that dismal gift on to her
National Association, she had followed her inveterate custom: she had
tied a string to its hind leg, and kept one end of it hitched to her
belt. We have seen her do that in the case of the Boston Mosque. When
she deeds property, she puts in that string-clause. It provides that
under certain conditions she can pull the string and land the property
in the cherished home of its happy youth. In the present case she
believed that she had made provision that if at any time the National
Christian Science Association should dissolve itself by a formal vote,
she could pull.</p>
<p>A year after Nixon’s handsome report, she writes the Association that
she has a “unique request to lay before it.“ It has dissolved, and she
is not quite sure that the Christian Science Journal has “already fallen
into her hands“ by that act, though it “seems“ to her to have met with
that accident; so she would like to have the matter decided by a formal
vote. But whether there is a doubt or not, “I see the wisdom,“ she says,
“of again owning this Christian Science waif.“</p>
<p>I think that that is unassailable evidence that the waif was making
money, hands down.</p>
<p>She pulled her gift in. A few years later she donated the Publishing
Society, along with its real estate, its buildings, its plant, its
publications, and its money–the whole worth twenty–two thousand dollars,
and free of debt–to–Well, to the Mother-Church!</p>
<p>That is to say, to herself. There is an act count of it in the
Christian Science Journal, and of how she had already made some other
handsome gifts–to her Church–and others to–to her Cause besides “an
almost countless number of private charities“ of cloudy amount and
otherwise indefinite. This landslide of generosities overwhelmed one of
her literary domestics. While he was in that condition he tried to
express what he felt:</p>
<p>“Let us endeavor to lift up our hearts in thankfulness to . . . our
Mother in Israel for these evidences of generosity and self-sacrifice
that appeal to our deepest sense of gratitude, even while surpassing our
comprehension.“</p>
<p>A year or two later, Mrs. Eddy promulgated some By-laws of a
self-sacrificing sort which assuaged him, perhaps, and perhaps enabled
his surpassed comprehension to make a sprint and catch up. These are to
be found in Art. XII., entitled.</p>
<p>THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING SOCIETY</p>
<p>This Article puts the whole publishing business into the hands of a
publishing Board–special. Mrs. Eddy appoints to its vacancies.</p>
<p>The profits go semi-annually to the Treasurer of the Mother-Church.
Mrs. Eddy owns the Treasurer.</p>
<p>Editors and publishers of the Christian Science Journal cannot be
elected or removed without Mrs. Eddy’s knowledge and consent.</p>
<p>Every candidate for employment in a high capacity or a low one, on
the other periodicals or in the publishing house, must first be
“accepted by Mrs. Eddy as suitable.“ And “by the Board of
Directors“–which is surplusage, since Mrs. Eddy owns the Board.</p>
<p>If at any time a weekly shall be started, “it shall be owned by The
First Church of Christ, Scientist“–which is Mrs. Eddy.</p>
