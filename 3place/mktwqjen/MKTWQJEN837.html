<h4 id="portrait-of-king-william-iii">PORTRAIT OF KING WILLIAM III</h4>
<p>I never can look at those periodical portraits in THE GALAXY magazine
without feeling a wild, tempestuous ambition to be an artist. I have
seen thousands and thousands of pictures in my time –acres of them here
and leagues of them in the galleries of Europe –but never any that moved
me as these portraits do.</p>
<p>There is a portrait of Monsignore Capel in the November number, now
COULD anything be sweeter than that? And there was Bismarck’s, in the
October number; who can look at that without being purer and stronger
and nobler for it? And Thurlow and Weed’s picture in the September
number; I would not have died without seeing that, no, not for anything
this world can give. But look back still further and recall my own
likeness as printed in the August number; if I had been in my grave a
thousand years when that appeared, I would have got up and visited the
artist.</p>
<p>I sleep with all these portraits under my pillow every night, so that
I can go on studying them as soon as the day dawns in the morning. I
know them all as thoroughly as if I had made them myself; I know every
line and mark about them. Sometimes when company are present I shuffle
the portraits all up together, and then pick them out one by one and
call their names, without referring to the printing on the bottom. I
seldom make a mistake–never, when I am calm.</p>
<p>I have had the portraits framed for a long time, waiting till my aunt
gets everything ready for hanging them up in the parlor. But first one
thing and then another interferes, and so the thing is delayed. Once she
said they would have more of the peculiar kind of light they needed in
the attic. The old simpleton! it is as dark as a tomb up there. But she
does not know anything about art, and so she has no reverence for it.
When I showed her my “Map of the Fortifications of Paris,“ she said it
was rubbish.</p>
<p>Well, from nursing those portraits so long, I have come at last to
have a perfect infatuation for art. I have a teacher now, and my
enthusiasm continually and tumultuously grows, as I learn to use with
more and more facility the pencil, brush, and graver. I am studying
under De Mellville, the house and portrait painter. [His name was Smith
when he lived in the West.] He does any kind of artist work a body
wants, having a genius that is universal, like Michael Angelo. Resembles
that great artist, in fact. The back of his head is like this, and he
wears his hat-brim tilted down on his nose to expose it.</p>
<p>I have been studying under De Mellville several months now. The first
month I painted fences, and gave general satisfaction. The next month I
white-washed a barn. The third, I was doing tin roofs; the forth, common
signs; the fifth, statuary to stand before cigar shops. This present
month is only the sixth, and I am already in portraits!</p>
<p>The humble offering which accompanies these remarks [see figure] –the
portrait of his Majesty William III., King of Prussia –is my fifth
attempt in portraits, and my greatest success. It has received unbounded
praise from all classes of the community, but that which gratifies me
most is the frequent and cordial verdict that it resembles the GALAXY
portraits. Those were my first love, my earliest admiration, the
original source and incentive of my art-ambition. Whatever I am in Art
today, I owe to these portraits. I ask no credit for myself–I deserve
none. And I never take any, either. Many a stranger has come to my
exhibition (for I have had my portrait of King William on exhibition at
one dollar a ticket), and would have gone away blessing ME, if I had let
him, but I never did. I always stated where I got the idea.</p>
<p>King William wears large bushy side-whiskers, and some critics have
thought that this portrait would be more complete if they were added.
But it was not possible. There was not room for side-whiskers and
epaulets both, and so I let the whiskers go, and put in the epaulets,
for the sake of style. That thing on his hat is an eagle. The Prussian
eagle–it is a national emblem. When I say hat I mean helmet; but it
seems impossible to make a picture of a helmet that a body can have
confidence in.</p>
<p>I wish kind friends everywhere would aid me in my endeavor to attract
a little attention to the GALAXY portraits. I feel persuaded it can be
accomplished, if the course to be pursued be chosen with judgment. I
write for that magazine all the time, and so do many abler men, and if I
can get these portraits into universal favor, it is all I ask; the
reading-matter will take care of itself.</p>
<p>COMMENDATIONS OF THE PORTRAIT</p>
<p>There is nothing like it in the Vatican. Pius IX.</p>
<p>It has none of that vagueness, that dreamy spirituality about it,
which many of the first critics of Arkansas have objected to in the
Murillo school of Art. Ruskin.</p>
<p>The expression is very interesting. J.W. Titian.</p>
<p>(Keeps a macaroni store in Venice, at the old family stand.)</p>
<p>It is the neatest thing in still life I have seen for years.</p>
<p>Rosa Bonheur.</p>
<p>The smile may be almost called unique. Bismarck.</p>
<p>I never saw such character portrayed in a picture face before. De
Mellville.</p>
<p>There is a benignant simplicity about the execution of this work
which warms the heart toward it as much, full as much, as it fascinates
the eye. Landseer.</p>
<p>One cannot see it without longing to contemplate the artist.</p>
<p>Frederick William.</p>
<p>Send me the entire edition–together with the plate and the original
portrait–and name your own price. And–would you like to come over and
stay awhile with Napoleon at Wilhelmsh:ohe? It shall not cost you a
cent. William III.</p>
