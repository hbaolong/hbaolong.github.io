<h4 id="chapter-lxxv.">CHAPTER LXXV.</h4>
<p>The next night was appointed for a visit to the bottom of the crater,
for we desired to traverse its floor and see the “North Lake“ (of fire)
which lay two miles away, toward the further wall. After dark half a
dozen of us set out, with lanterns and native guides, and climbed down a
crazy, thousand-foot pathway in a crevice fractured in the crater wall,
and reached the bottom in safety.</p>
<p>The irruption of the previous evening had spent its force and the
floor looked black and cold; but when we ran out upon it we found it hot
yet, to the feet, and it was likewise riven with crevices which revealed
the underlying fires gleaming vindictively. A neighboring cauldron was
threatening to overflow, and this added to the dubiousness of the
situation. So the native guides refused to continue the venture, and
then every body deserted except a stranger named Marlette. He said he
had been in the crater a dozen times in daylight and believed he could
find his way through it at night. He thought that a run of three hundred
yards would carry us over the hottest part of the floor and leave us our
shoe-soles. His pluck gave me back-bone. We took one lantern and
instructed the guides to hang the other to the roof of the look-out
house to serve as a beacon for us in case we got lost, and then the
party started back up the precipice and Marlette and I made our run. We
skipped over the hot floor and over the red crevices with brisk dispatch
and reached the cold lava safe but with pretty warm feet. Then we took
things leisurely and comfortably, jumping tolerably wide and probably
bottomless chasms, and threading our way through picturesque lava
upheavals with considerable confidence. When we got fairly away from the
cauldrons of boiling fire, we seemed to be in a gloomy desert, and a
suffocatingly dark one, surrounded by dim walls that seemed to tower to
the sky. The only cheerful objects were the glinting stars high
overhead.</p>
<p>By and by Marlette shouted “Stop!“ I never stopped quicker in my
life. I asked what the matter was. He said we were out of the path. He
said we must not try to go on till we found it again, for we were
surrounded with beds of rotten lava through which we could easily break
and plunge down a thousand feet. I thought eight hundred would answer
for me, and was about to say so when Marlette partly proved his
statement by accidentally crushing through and disappearing to his
arm-pits.</p>
<p>He got out and we hunted for the path with the lantern. He said there
was only one path and that it was but vaguely defined. We could not find
it. The lava surface was all alike in the lantern light. But he was an
ingenious man. He said it was not the lantern that had informed him that
we were out of the path, but his feet. He had noticed a crisp grinding
of fine lava-needles under his feet, and some instinct reminded him that
in the path these were all worn away. So he put the lantern behind him,
and began to search with his boots instead of his eyes. It was good
sagacity. The first time his foot touched a surface that did not grind
under it he announced that the trail was found again; and after that we
kept up a sharp listening for the rasping sound and it always warned us
in time.</p>
<p>It was a long tramp, but an exciting one. We reached the North Lake
between ten and eleven o’clock, and sat down on a huge overhanging
lava-shelf, tired but satisfied. The spectacle presented was worth
coming double the distance to see. Under us, and stretching away before
us, was a heaving sea of molten fire of seemingly limitless extent. The
glare from it was so blinding that it was some time before we could bear
to look upon it steadily.</p>
<p>It was like gazing at the sun at noon-day, except that the glare was
not quite so white. At unequal distances all around the shores of the
lake were nearly white-hot chimneys or hollow drums of lava, four or
five feet high, and up through them were bursting gorgeous sprays of
lava-gouts and gem spangles, some white, some red and some golden–a
ceaseless bombardment, and one that fascinated the eye with its
unapproachable splendor. The mere distant jets, sparkling up through an
intervening gossamer veil of vapor, seemed miles away; and the further
the curving ranks of fiery fountains receded, the more fairy-like and
beautiful they appeared.</p>
<p>Now and then the surging bosom of the lake under our noses would calm
down ominously and seem to be gathering strength for an enterprise; and
then all of a sudden a red dome of lava of the bulk of an ordinary
dwelling would heave itself aloft like an escaping balloon, then burst
asunder, and out of its heart would flit a pale-green film of vapor, and
float upward and vanish in the darkness–a released soul soaring homeward
from captivity with the damned, no doubt. The crashing plunge of the
ruined dome into the lake again would send a world of seething billows
lashing against the shores and shaking the foundations of our perch. By
and by, a loosened mass of the hanging shelf we sat on tumbled into the
lake, jarring the surroundings like an earthquake and delivering a
suggestion that may have been intended for a hint, and may not. We did
not wait to see.</p>
<p>We got lost again on our way back, and were more than an hour hunting
for the path. We were where we could see the beacon lantern at the
look-out house at the time, but thought it was a star and paid no
attention to it. We reached the hotel at two o’clock in the morning
pretty well fagged out.</p>
<p>Kilauea never overflows its vast crater, but bursts a passage for its
lava through the mountain side when relief is necessary, and then the
destruction is fearful. About 1840 it rent its overburdened stomach and
sent a broad river of fire careering down to the sea, which swept away
forests, huts, plantations and every thing else that lay in its path.
The stream was five miles broad, in places, and two hundred feet deep,
and the distance it traveled was forty miles. It tore up and bore away
acre-patches of land on its bosom like rafts–rocks, trees and all
intact. At night the red glare was visible a hundred miles at sea; and
at a distance of forty miles fine print could be read at midnight. The
atmosphere was poisoned with sulphurous vapors and choked with falling
ashes, pumice stones and cinders; countless columns of smoke rose up and
blended together in a tumbled canopy that hid the heavens and glowed
with a ruddy flush reflected from the fires below; here and there jets
of lava sprung hundreds of feet into the air and burst into
rocket-sprays that returned to earth in a crimson rain; and all the
while the laboring mountain shook with Nature’s great palsy and voiced
its distress in moanings and the muffled booming of subterranean
thunders.</p>
<p>Fishes were killed for twenty miles along the shore, where the lava
entered the sea. The earthquakes caused some loss of human life, and a
prodigious tidal wave swept inland, carrying every thing before it and
drowning a number of natives. The devastation consummated along the
route traversed by the river of lava was complete and incalculable. Only
a Pompeii and a Herculaneum were needed at the foot of Kilauea to make
the story of the irruption immortal.</p>
