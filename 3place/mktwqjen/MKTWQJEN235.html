<h4 id="about-barbers">ABOUT BARBERS</h4>
<p>All things change except barbers, the ways of barbers, and the
surroundings of barbers. These never change. What one experiences in a
barber’s shop the first time he enters one is what he always experiences
in barbers’ shops afterward till the end of his days. I got shaved this
morning as usual. A man approached the door from Jones Street as I
approached it from Main–a thing that always happens. I hurried up, but
it was of no use; he entered the door one little step ahead of me, and I
followed in on his heels and saw him take the only vacant chair, the one
presided over by the best barber. It always happens so. I sat down,
hoping that I might fall heir to the chair belonging to the better of
the remaining two barbers, for he had already begun combing his man’s
hair, while his comrade was not yet quite done rubbing up and oiling his
customer’s locks. I watched the probabilities with strong interest. When
I saw that No. 2 was gaining on No. 1 my interest grew to solicitude.
When No. 1 stopped a moment to make change on a bath ticket for a
new-comer, and lost ground in the race, my solicitude rose to anxiety.
When No. 1 caught up again, and both he and his comrade were pulling the
towels away and brushing the powder from their customers’ cheeks, and it
was about an even thing which one would say “Next!“ first, my very
breath stood still with the suspense. But when at the culminating moment
No. 1 stopped to pass a comb a couple of times through his customer’s
eyebrows, I saw that he had lost the race by a single instant, and I
rose indignant and quitted the shop, to keep from falling into the hands
of No. 2; for I have none of that enviable firmness that enables a man
to look calmly into the eyes of a waiting barber and tell him he will
wait for his fellow-barber’s chair.</p>
<p>I stayed out fifteen minutes, and then went back, hoping for better
luck. Of course all the chairs were occupied now, and four men sat
waiting, silent, unsociable, distraught, and looking bored, as men
always do who are waiting their turn in a barber’s shop. I sat down in
one of the iron-armed compartments of an old sofa, and put in the time
far a while reading the framed advertisements of all sorts of quack
nostrums for dyeing and coloring the hair. Then I read the greasy names
on the private bayrum bottles; read the names and noted the numbers on
the private shaving-cups in the pigeonholes; studied the stained and
damaged cheap prints on the walls, of battles, early Presidents, and
voluptuous recumbent sultanas, and the tiresome and everlasting young
girl putting her grandfather’s spectacles on; execrated in my heart the
cheerful canary and the distracting parrot that few barbers’ shops are
without. Finally, I searched out the least dilapidated of last year’s
illustrated papers that littered the foul center-table, and conned their
unjustifiable misrepresentations of old forgotten events.</p>
<p>At last my turn came. A voice said “Next!“ and I surrendered
to–No. 2, of course. It always happens so. I said meekly that I was in a
hurry, and it affected him as strongly as if he had never heard it. He
shoved up my head, and put a napkin under it. He plowed his fingers into
my collar and fixed a towel there. He explored my hair with his claws
and suggested that it needed trimming. I said I did not want it trimmed.
He explored again and said it was pretty long for the present
style–better have a little taken off; it needed it behind especially. I
said I had had it cut only a week before. He yearned over it
reflectively a moment, and then asked with a disparaging manner, who cut
it? I came back at him promptly with a “You did!“ I had him there. Then
he fell to stirring up his lather and regarding himself in the glass,
stopping now and then to get close and examine his chin critically or
inspect a pimple. Then he lathered one side of my face thoroughly, and
was about to lather the other, when a dog-fight attracted his attention,
and he ran to the window and stayed and saw it out, losing two shillings
on the result in bets with the other barbers, a thing which gave me
great satisfaction. He finished lathering, and then began to rub in the
suds with his hand.</p>
<p>He now began to sharpen his razor on an old suspender, and was
delayed a good deal on account of a controversy about a cheap masquerade
ball he had figured at the night before, in red cambric and bogus
ermine, as some kind of a king. He was so gratified with being chaffed
about some damsel whom he had smitten with his charms that he used every
means to continue the controversy by pretending to be annoyed at the
chaffings of his fellows. This matter begot more surveyings of himself
in the glass, and he put down his razor and brushed his hair with
elaborate care, plastering an inverted arch of it down on his forehead,
accomplishing an accurate “Part“ behind, and brushing the two wings
forward over his ears with nice exactness. In the mean time the lather
was drying on my face, and apparently eating into my vitals.</p>
<p>Now he began to shave, digging his fingers into my countenance to
stretch the skin and bundling and tumbling my head this way and that as
convenience in shaving demanded. As long as he was on the tough sides of
my face I did not suffer; but when he began to rake, and rip, and tug at
my chin, the tears came. He now made a handle of my nose, to assist him
shaving the corners of my upper lip, and it was by this bit of
circumstantial evidence that I discovered that a part of his duties in
the shop was to clean the kerosene-lamps. I had often wondered in an
indolent way whether the barbers did that, or whether it was the
boss.</p>
<p>About this time I was amusing myself trying to guess where he would
be most likely to cut me this time, but he got ahead of me, and sliced
me on the end of the chin before I had got my mind made up. He
immediately sharpened his razor–he might have done it before. I do not
like a close shave, and would not let him go over me a second time. I
tried to get him to put up his razor, dreading that he would make for
the side of my chin, my pet tender spot, a place which a razor cannot
touch twice without making trouble; but he said he only wanted to just
smooth off one little roughness, and in the same moment he slipped his
razor along the forbidden ground, and the dreaded pimple-signs of a
close shave rose up smarting and answered to the call. Now he soaked his
towel in bay rum, and slapped it all over my face nastily; slapped it
over as if a human being ever yet washed his face in that way. Then he
dried it by slapping with the dry part of the towel, as if a human being
ever dried his face in such a fashion; but a barber seldom rubs you like
a Christian. Next he poked bay ruin into the cut place with his towel,
then choked the wound with powdered starch, then soaked it with bay rum
again, and would have gone on soaking and powdering it forevermore, no
doubt, if I had not rebelled and begged off. He powdered my whole face
now, straightened me up, and began to plow my hair thoughtfully with his
hands. Then he suggested a shampoo, and said my hair needed it badly,
very badly. I observed that I shampooed it myself very thoroughly in the
bath yesterday. I “had him“ again. He next recommended some of “Smith’s
Hair Glorifier,“ and offered to sell me a bottle. I declined. He praised
the new perfume, “Jones’s Delight of the Toilet,“ and proposed to sell
me some of that. I declined again. He tendered me a tooth-wash atrocity
of his own invention, and when I declined offered to trade knives with
me.</p>
<p>He returned to business after the miscarriage of this last
enterprise, sprinkled me all over, legs and all, greased my hair in
defiance of my protest against it, rubbed and scrubbed a good deal of it
out by the roots, and combed and brushed the rest, parting it behind,
and plastering the eternal inverted arch of hair down on my forehead,
and then, while combing my scant eyebrows and defiling them with pomade,
strung out an account of the achievements of a six-ounce black-and-tan
terrier of his till I heard the whistles blow for noon, and knew I was
five minutes too late for the train. Then he snatched away the towel,
brushed it lightly about my face, passed his comb through my eyebrows
once more, and gaily sang out “Next!“</p>
<p>This barber fell down and died of apoplexy two hours later. I am
waiting over a day for my revenge–I am going to attend his funeral.</p>
