<h4 id="laymans-sermon">LAYMAN’S SERMON</h4>
<p>The Young Men’s Christian Association asked Mr. Clemens to deliver a
lay sermon at the Majestic Theatre, New York, March 4, 1906. More than
five thousand young men tried to get into the theatre, and in a short
time traffic was practically stopped in the adjacent streets. The police
reserves had to be called out to thin the crowd. Doctor Fagnani had said
something before about the police episode, and Mr. Clemens took it
up.</p>
<p>I have been listening to what was said here, and there is in it a
lesson of citizenship. You created the police, and you are responsible
for them. One must pause, therefore, before criticising them too
harshly. They are citizens, just as we are. A little of citizenship
ought to be taught at the mother’s knee and in the nursery. Citizenship
is what makes a republic; monarchies can get along without it. What
keeps a republic on its legs is good citizenship.</p>
<p>Organization is necessary in all things. It is even necessary in
reform. I was an organization myself once–for twelve hours. I was in
Chicago a few years ago about to depart for New York. There were with me
Mr. Osgood, a publisher, and a stenographer. I picked out a state-room
on a train, the principal feature of which was that it contained the
privilege of smoking. The train had started but a short time when the
conductor came in and said that there had been a mistake made, and asked
that we vacate the apartment. I refused, but when I went out on the
platform Osgood and the stenographer agreed to accept a section. They
were too modest.</p>
<p>Now, I am not modest. I was born modest, but it didn’t last. I
asserted myself; insisted upon my rights, and finally the Pullman
Conductor and the train conductor capitulated, and I was left in
possession.</p>
<p>I went into the dining–car the next morning for breakfast. Ordinarily
I only care for coffee and rolls, but this particular morning I espied
an important-looking man on the other side of the car eating broiled
chicken. I asked for broiled chicken, and I was told by the waiter and
later by the dining-car conductor that there was no broiled chicken.
There must have been an argument, for the Pullman conductor came in and
remarked: “If he wants broiled chicken, give it to him. If you haven’t
got it on the train, stop somewhere. It will be better for all
concerned!“ I got the chicken.</p>
<p>It is from experiences such as these that you get your education of
life, and you string them into jewels or into tinware, as you may
choose. I have received recently several letters asking my counsel or
advice. The principal request is for some incident that may prove
helpful to the young. There were a lot of incidents in my career to help
me along –sometimes they helped me along faster than I wanted to go.</p>
<p>Here is such a request. It is a telegram from Joplin, Missouri, and
it reads: “In what one of your works can we find the definition of a
gentleman?“</p>
<p>I have not answered that telegram, either; I couldn’t. It seems to me
that if any man has just merciful and kindly instincts he would be a
gentleman, for he would need nothing else in the world.</p>
<p>I received the other day a letter from my old friend, William Dean
Howells–Howells, the head of American literature. No one is able to
stand with him. He is an old, old friend of mine, and he writes me,
“To-morrow I shall be sixty-nine years old.“ Why, I am surprised at
Howells writing that! I have known him longer than that. I’m sorry to
see a man trying to appear so young. Let’s see. Howells says now, “I see
you have been burying Patrick. I suppose he was old, too.“</p>
<p>No, he was never old–Patrick. He came to us thirty-six years ago. He
was my coachman on the morning that I drove my young bride to our new
home. He was a young Irishman, slender, tall, lithe, honest, truthful,
and he never changed in all his life. He really was with us but
twenty-five years, for he did not go with us to Europe, but he never
regarded that as separation. As the children grew up he was their guide.
He was all honor, honesty, and affection. He was with us in New
Hampshire, with us last summer, and his hair was just as black, his eyes
were just as blue, his form just as straight, and his heart just as good
as on the day we first met. In all the long years Patrick never made a
mistake. He never needed an order, he never received a command. He knew.
I have been asked for my idea of an ideal gentleman, and I give it to
you Patrick McAleer.</p>
<p>UNIVERSITY SETTLEMENT SOCIETY</p>
<p>After the serious addresses were made, Seth Low introduced
Mr. Clemens at the Settlement House, February 2, 1901.</p>
<p>The older we grow the greater becomes our, wonder at how much
ignorance one can contain without bursting one’s clothes. Ten days ago I
did not know anything about the University Settlement except what I’d
read in the pamphlets sent me. Now, after being here and hearing
Mrs. Hewitt and Mrs. Thomas, it seems to me I know of nothing like it at
all. It’s a charity that carries no humiliation with it. Marvellous it
is, to think of schools where you don’t have to drive the children in
but drive them out. It was not so in my day.</p>
<p>Down-stairs just now I saw a dancing lesson going on. You must pay a
cent for a lesson. You can’t get it for nothing. That’s the reason I
never learned to dance.</p>
<p>But it was the pawnbroker’s shop you have here that interested me
mightily. I’ve known something about pawnbrokers’ shops in my time, but
here you have a wonderful plan. The ordinary pawnbroker charges
thirty-six per cent. a year for a loan, and I’ve paid more myself, but
here a man or woman in distress can obtain a loan for one per cent. a
month! It’s wonderful!</p>
<p>I’ve been interested in all I’ve heard to-day, especially in the
romances recounted by Mrs. Thomas, which reminds me that I have a
romance of my own in my autobiography, which I am building for the
instruction of the world.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, many years ago, when I was a newspaper reporter
(perhaps I should say I had been and was willing to be), a pawnbroker
was taking care of what property I had. There was a friend of mine, a
poet, out of a job, and he was having a hard time of it, too. There was
passage in it, but I guess I’ve got to keep that for the
autobiography.</p>
<p>Well, my friend the poet thought his life was a failure, and I told
him I thought it was, and then he said he thought he ought to commit
suicide, and I said “all right,“ which was disinterested advice to a
friend in trouble; but, like all such advice, there was just a little
bit of self-interest back of it, for if I could get a “scoop“ on the
other newspapers I could get a job.</p>
<p>The poet could be spared, and so, largely for his own good and partly
for mine, I kept the thing in his mind, which was necessary, as would-be
suicides are very changeable aid hard to hold to their purpose. He had a
preference for a pistol, which was an extravagance, for we hadn’t enough
between us to hire a pistol. A fork would have been easier.</p>
<p>And so he concluded to drown himself, and I said it was an excellent
idea–the only trouble being that he was so good a swimmer. So we went
down to the beach. I went along to see that the thing was done right.
Then something most romantic happened. There came in on the sea
something that had been on its way for three years. It rolled in across
the broad Pacific with a message that was full of meaning to that poor
poet and cast itself at his feet. It was a life-preserver! This was a
complication. And then I had an idea–he never had any, especially when
he was going to write poetry; I suggested that we pawn the
life-preserver and get a revolver.</p>
<p>The pawnbroker gave us an old derringer with a bullet as big as a
hickory nut. When he heard that it was only a poet that was going to
kill himself he did not quibble. Well, we succeeded in sending a bullet
right through his head. It was a terrible moment when he placed that
pistol against his forehead and stood for an instant. I said, “Oh, pull
the trigger!“ and he did, and cleaned out all the gray matter in his
brains. It carried the poetic faculty away, and now he’s a useful member
of society.</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I realize that there’s no more beneficent institution
than this penny fund of yours, and I want all the poets to know this. I
did think about writing you a check, but now I think I’ll send you a few
copies of what one of your little members called ‘Strawberry Finn’.</p>
<p>PUBLIC EDUCATION ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT A MEETING OF THE BERKELEY LYCEUM, NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 23,
1900</p>
<p>I don’t suppose that I am called here as an expert on education, for
that would show a lack of foresight on your part and a deliberate
intention to remind me of my shortcomings.</p>
<p>As I sat here looking around for an idea it struck me that I was
called for two reasons. One was to do good to me, a poor unfortunate
traveller on the world’s wide ocean, by giving me a knowledge of the
nature and scope of your society and letting me know that others beside
myself have been of some use in the world. The other reason that I can
see is that you have called me to show by way of contrast what education
can accomplish if administered in the right sort of doses.</p>
<p>Your worthy president said that the school pictures, which have
received the admiration of the world at the Paris Exposition, have been
sent to Russia, and this was a compliment from that Government–which is
very surprising to me. Why, it is only an hour since I read a cablegram
in the newspapers beginning “Russia Proposes to Retrench.“ I was not
expecting such a thunderbolt, and I thought what a happy thing it will
be for Russians when the retrenchment will bring home the thirty
thousand Russian troops now in Manchuria, to live in peaceful pursuits.
I thought this was what Germany should do also without delay, and that
France and all the other nations in China should follow suit.</p>
<p>Why should not China be free from the foreigners, who are only making
trouble on her soil? If they would only all go home, what a pleasant
place China would be for the Chinese! We do not allow Chinamen to come
here, and I say in all seriousness that it would be a graceful thing to
let China decide who shall go there.</p>
<p>China never wanted foreigners any more than foreigners wanted
Chinamen, and on this question I am with the Boxers every time. The
Boxer is a patriot. He loves his country better than he does the
countries of other people. I wish him success. The Boxer believes in
driving us out of his country. I am a Boxer too, for I believe in
driving him out of our country.</p>
<p>When I read the Russian despatch further my dream of world peace
vanished. It said that the vast expense of maintaining the army had made
it necessary to retrench, and so the Government had decided that to
support the army it would be necessary to withdraw the appropriation
from the public schools. This is a monstrous idea to us.</p>
<p>We believe that out of the public school grows the greatness of a
nation.</p>
<p>It is curious to reflect how history repeats itself the world over.
Why, I remember the same thing was done when I was a boy on the
Mississippi River. There was a proposition in a township there to
discontinue public schools because they were too expensive. An old
farmer spoke up and said if they stopped the schools they would not save
anything, because every time a school was closed a jail had to be
built.</p>
<p>It’s like feeding a dog on his own tail. He’ll never get fat. I
believe it is better to support schools than jails.</p>
<p>The work of your association is better and shows more wisdom than the
Czar of Russia and all his people. This is not much of a compliment, but
it’s the best I’ve got in stock.</p>
<p>EDUCATION AND CITIZENSHIP</p>
<p>On the evening of May 14, 1908, the alumni of the College of the City
of New York celebrated the opening of the new college buildings at a
banquet in the Waldorf Astoria. Mr. Clemens followed Mayor
McClellan.</p>
<p>I agreed when the Mayor said that there was not a man within hearing
who did not agree that citizenship should be placed above everything
else, even learning.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about this? Is there a college in the whole
country where there is a chair of good citizenship? There is a kind of
bad citizenship which is taught in the schools, but no real good
citizenship taught. There are some which teach insane citizenship,
bastard citizenship, but that is all. Patriotism! Yes; but patriotism is
usually the refuge of the scoundrel. He is the man who talks the
loudest.</p>
<p>You can begin that chair of citizenship in the College of the City of
New York. You can place it above mathematics and literature, and that is
where it belongs.</p>
<p>We used to trust in God. I think it was in 1863 that some genius
suggested that it be put upon the gold and silver coins which circulated
among the rich. They didn’t put it on the nickels and coppers because
they didn’t think the poor folks had any trust in God.</p>
<p>Good citizenship would teach accuracy of thinking and accuracy of
statement. Now, that motto on the coin is an overstatement. Those
Congressmen had no right to commit this whole country to a theological
doctrine. But since they did, Congress ought to state what our creed
should be.</p>
<p>There was never a nation in the world that put its whole trust in
God. It is a statement made on insufficient evidence. Leaving out the
gamblers, the burglars, and the plumbers, perhaps we do put our trust in
God after a fashion. But, after all, it is an overstatement.</p>
<p>If the cholera or black plague should come to these shores, perhaps
the bulk of the nation would pray to be delivered from it, but the rest
would put their trust in the Health Board of the City of New York.</p>
<p>I read in the papers within the last day or two of a poor young girl
who they said was a leper. Did the people in that populous section of
the country where she was–did they put their trust in God? The girl was
afflicted with the leprosy, a disease which cannot be communicated from
one person to another.</p>
<p>Yet, instead of putting their trust in God, they harried that poor
creature, shelterless and friendless, from place to place, exactly as
they did in the Middle Ages, when they made lepers wear bells, so that
people could be warned of their approach and avoid them. Perhaps those
people in the Middle Ages thought they were putting their trust in
God.</p>
<p>The President ordered the removal of that motto from the coin, and I
thought that it was well. I thought that overstatement should not stay
there. But I think it would better read, “Within certain judicious
limitations we trust in God,“ and if there isn’t enough room on the coin
for this, why, enlarge the coin.</p>
<p>Now I want to tell a story about jumping at conclusions. It was told
to me by Bram Stoker, and it concerns a christening. There was a little
clergyman who was prone to jump at conclusions sometimes. One day he was
invited to officiate at a christening. He went. There sat the
relatives–intelligent-looking relatives they were. The little
clergyman’s instinct came to him to make a great speech. He was given to
flights of oratory that way–a very dangerous thing, for often the wings
which take one into clouds of oratorical enthusiasm are wax and melt up
there, and down you come.</p>
<p>But the little clergyman couldn’t resist. He took the child in his
arms, and, holding it, looked at it a moment. It wasn’t much of a child.
It was little, like a sweet-potato. Then the little clergyman waited
impressively, and then: “I see in your countenances,“ he said,
“disappointment of him. I see you are disappointed with this baby. Why?
Because he is so little. My friends, if you had but the power of looking
into the future you might see that great things may come of little
things. There is the great ocean, holding the navies of the world, which
comes from little drops of water no larger than a woman’s tears. There
are the great constellations in the sky, made up of little bits of
stars. Oh, if you could consider his future you might see that he might
become the greatest poet of the universe, the greatest warrior the world
has ever known, greater than Caesar, than Hannibal, than–er–er“ (turning
to the father)–“what’s his name?“</p>
<p>The father hesitated, then whispered back: “His name? Well, his name
is Mary Ann.“</p>
<p>COURAGE</p>
<p>At a beefsteak dinner, given by artists, caricaturists, and humorists
of New York City, April 18, 1908, Mr. Clemens, Mr. H. H. Rogers, and
Mr. Patrick McCarren were the guests of honor. Each wore a white apron,
and each made a short speech.</p>
<p>In the matter of courage we all have our limits.</p>
<p>There never was a hero who did not have his bounds. I suppose it may
be said of Nelson and all the others whose courage has been advertised
that there came times in their lives when their bravery knew it had come
to its limit.</p>
<p>I have found mine a good many times. Sometimes this was
expected–often it was unexpected. I know a man who is not afraid to
sleep with a rattlesnake, but you could not get him to sleep with a
safety-razor.</p>
<p>I never had the courage to talk across a long, narrow room I should
be at the end of the room facing all the audience. If I attempt to talk
across a room I find myself turning this way and that, and thus at
alternate periods I have part of the audience behind me. You ought never
to have any part of the audience behind you; you never can tell what
they are going to do.</p>
<p>I’ll sit down.</p>
<p>THE DINNER TO MR. CHOATE</p>
<p>AT A DINNER GIVEN IN HONOR OF AMBASSADOR JOSEPH H. CHOATE AT THE
LOTOS CLUB, NOVEMBER 24, 7902</p>
<p>The speakers, among others, were: Senator Depew, William Henry White,
Speaker Thomas Reed, and Mr. Choate. Mr. Clemens spoke, in part, as
follows:</p>
<p>The greatness of this country rests on two anecdotes. The first one
is that of Washington and his hatchet, representing the foundation of
true speaking, which is the characteristic of our people. The second one
is an old one, and I’ve been waiting to hear it to-night; but as nobody
has told it yet, I will tell it.</p>
<p>You’ve heard it before, and you’ll hear it many, many times more. It
is an anecdote of our guest, of the time when he was engaged as a young
man with a gentle Hebrew, in the process of skinning the client. The
main part in that business is the collection of the bill for services in
skinning the man. “Services“ is the term used in that craft for the
operation of that kind-diplomatic in its nature.</p>
<p>Choate’s–co-respondent–made out a bill for 00 for his services, so
called. But Choate told him he had better leave the matter to him, and
the next day he collected the bill for the services and handed the
Hebrew 000, saying, “That’s your half of the loot,“ and inducing that
memorable response: “Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.“</p>
<p>The deep-thinkers didn’t merely laugh when that happened. They
stopped to think, and said “There’s a rising man. He must be rescued
from the law and consecrated to diplomacy. The commercial advantages of
a great nation lie there in that man’s keeping. We no longer require a
man to take care of our moral character before the world. Washington and
his anecdote have done that. We require a man to take care of our
commercial prosperity.“</p>
<p>Mr. Choate has carried that trait with him, and, as Mr. Carnegie has
said, he has worked like a mole underground.</p>
<p>We see the result when American railroad iron is sold so cheap in
England that the poorest family can have it. He has so beguiled that
Cabinet of England.</p>
<p>He has been spreading the commerce of this nation, and has depressed
English commerce in the same ratio. This was the principle underlying
that anecdote, and the wise men saw it; the principle of give and take
–give one and take ten–the principle of diplomacy.</p>
<p>ON STANLEY AND LIVINGSTONE</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens was entertained at dinner by the Whitefriars’ Club,
London, at the Mitre Tavern, on the evening of August 6, 1872. In reply
to the toast in his honor he said:</p>
<p>GENTLEMEN,–I thank you very heartily indeed for this expression of
kindness toward me. What I have done for England and civilization in the
arduous affairs which I have engaged in (that is good: that is so smooth
that I will say it again and again)–what I have done for England and
civilization in the arduous part I have performed I have done with a
single-hearted devotion and with no hope of reward. I am proud, I am
very proud, that it was reserved for me to find Doctor Livingstone and
for Mr. Stanley to get all the credit. I hunted for that man in Africa
all over seventy-five or one hundred parishes, thousands and thousands
of miles in the wilds and deserts all over the place, sometimes riding
negroes and sometimes travelling by rail. I didn’t mind the rail or
anything else, so that I didn’t come in for the tar and feathers. I
found that man at Ujiji–a place you may remember if you have ever been
there–and it was a very great satisfaction that I found him just in the
nick of time. I found that poor old man deserted by his niggers and by
his geographers, deserted by all of his kind except the gorillas
–dejected, miserable, famishing, absolutely famishing–but he was
eloquent. Just as I found him he had eaten his last elephant, and he
said to me: “God knows where I shall get another.“ He had nothing to
wear except his venerable and honorable naval suit, and nothing to eat
but his diary.</p>
<p>But I said to him: “It is all right; I have discovered you, and
Stanley will be here by the four-o’clock train and will discover you
officially, and then we will turn to and have a reg’lar good time.“ I
said: “Cheer up, for Stanley has got corn, ammunition, glass beads,
hymn-books, whiskey, and everything which the human heart can desire; he
has got all kinds of valuables, including telegraph-poles and a few
cart-loads of money. By this time communication has been made with the
land of Bibles and civilization, and property will advance.“ And then we
surveyed all that country, from Ujiji, through Unanogo and other places,
to Unyanyembe. I mention these names simply for your edification,
nothing more–do not expect it–particularly as intelligence to the Royal
Geographical Society. And then, having filled up the old man, we were
all too full for utterance and departed. We have since then feasted on
honors.</p>
<p>Stanley has received a snuff-box and I have received considerable
snuff; he has got to write a book and gather in the rest of the credit,
and I am going to levy on the copyright and to collect the money.
Nothing comes amiss to me–cash or credit; but, seriously, I do feel that
Stanley is the chief man and an illustrious one, and I do applaud him
with all my heart. Whether he is an American or a Welshman by birth, or
one, or both, matters not to me. So far as I am personally concerned, I
am simply here to stay a few months, and to see English people and to
learn English manners and customs, and to enjoy myself; so the simplest
thing I can do is to thank you for the toast you have honored me with
and for the remarks you have made, and to wish health and prosperity to
the Whitefriars’ Club, and to sink down to my accustomed level.</p>
<p>HENRY M. STANLEY</p>
<p>ADDRESS DELIVERED IN BOSTON, NOVEMBER, 1886</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens introduced Mr. Stanley.</p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, if any should ask, Why is it that you are here
as introducer of the lecturer? I should answer that I happened to be
around and was asked to perform this function. I was quite willing to do
so, and, as there was no sort of need of an introduction, anyway, it
could be necessary only that some person come forward for a moment and
do an unnecessary thing, and this is quite in my line. Now, to introduce
so illustrious a name as Henry M. Stanley by any detail of what the man
has done is clear aside from my purpose; that would be stretching the
unnecessary to an unconscionable degree. When I contrast what I have
achieved in my measurably brief life with what he has achieved in his
possibly briefer one, the effect is to sweep utterly away the ten-story
edifice of my own self-appreciation and leave nothing behind but the
cellar. When you compare these achievements of his with the achievements
of really great men who exist in history, the comparison, I believe, is
in his favor. I am not here to disparage Columbus.</p>
<p>No, I won’t do that; but when you come to regard the achievements of
these two men, Columbus and Stanley, from the standpoint of the
difficulties they encountered, the advantage is with Stanley and against
Columbus. Now, Columbus started out to discover America. Well, he didn’t
need to do anything at all but sit in the cabin of his ship and hold his
grip and sail straight on, and America would discover itself. Here it
was, barring his passage the whole length and breadth of the South
American continent, and he couldn’t get by it. He’d got to discover it.
But Stanley started out to find Doctor Livingstone, who was scattered
abroad, as you may say, over the length and breadth of a vast slab of
Africa as big as the United States.</p>
<p>It was a blind kind of search. He was the worst scattered of men. But
I will throw the weight of this introduction upon one very peculiar
feature of Mr. Stanley’s character, and that is his indestructible
Americanism –an Americanism which he is proud of. And in this day and
time, when it is the custom to ape and imitate English methods and
fashion, it is like a breath of fresh air to stand in the presence of
this untainted American citizen who has been caressed and complimented
by half of the crowned heads of Europe who could clothe his body from
his head to his heels with the orders and decorations lavished upon him.
And yet, when the untitled myriads of his own country put out their
hands in welcome to him and greet him, “Well done,“ through the Congress
of the United States, that is the crown that is worth all the rest to
him. He is a product of institutions which exist in no other country on
earth-institutions that bring out all that is best and most heroic in a
man. I introduce Henry M. Stanley.</p>
<p>DINNER TO MR. JEROME</p>
<p>A dinner to express their confidence in the integrity and good
judgment of District-Attorney Jerome was given at Delmonico’s by over
three hundred of his admirers on the evening of May 7, 1909.</p>
<p>Indeed, that is very sudden. I was not informed that the verdict was
going to depend upon my judgment, but that makes not the least
difference in the world when you already know all about it. It is not
any matter when you are called upon to express it; you can get up and do
it, and my verdict has already been recorded in my heart and in my head
as regards Mr. Jerome and his administration of the criminal affairs of
this county.</p>
<p>I agree with everything Mr. Choate has said in his letter regarding
Mr. Jerome; I agree with everything Mr. Shepard has said; and I agree
with everything Mr. Jerome has said in his own commendation. And I
thought Mr. Jerome was modest in that. If he had been talking about
another officer of this county, he could have painted the joys and
sorrows of office and his victories in even stronger language than he
did.</p>
<p>I voted for Mr. Jerome in those old days, and I should like to vote
for him again if he runs for any office. I moved out of New York, and
that is the reason, I suppose, I cannot vote for him again. There may be
some way, but I have not found it out. But now I am a farmer–a farmer up
in Connecticut, and winning laurels. Those people already speak with
such high favor, admiration, of my farming, and they say that I am the
only man that has ever come to that region who could make two blades of
grass grow where only three grew before.</p>
<p>Well, I cannot vote for him. You see that. As it stands now, I
cannot. I am crippled in that way and to that extent, for I would ever
so much like to do it. I am not a Congress, and I cannot distribute
pensions, and I don’t know any other legitimate way to buy a vote. But
if I should think of any legitimate way, I shall make use of it, and
then I shall vote for Mr. Jerome.</p>
<p>HENRY IRVING</p>
<p>The Dramatic and Literary Society of London gave a welcome-home
dinner to Sir Henry Irving at the Savoy Hotel, London, June 9, 1900. In
proposing the toast of “The Drama“ Mr. Clemens said:</p>
<p>I find my task a very easy one. I have been a dramatist for thirty
years. I have had an ambition in all that time to overdo the work of the
Spaniard who said he left behind him four hundred dramas when he died. I
leave behind me four hundred and fifteen, and am not yet dead.</p>
<p>The greatest of all the arts is to write a drama. It is a most
difficult thing. It requires the highest talent possible and the rarest
gifts. No, there is another talent that ranks with it–for anybody can
write a drama–I had four hundred of them–but to get one accepted
requires real ability. And I have never had that felicity yet.</p>
<p>But human nature is so constructed, we are so persistent, that when
we know that we are born to a thing we do not care what the world thinks
about it. We go on exploiting that talent year after year, as I have
done. I shall go on writing dramas, and some day the impossible may
happen, but I am not looking for it.</p>
<p>In writing plays the chief thing is novelty. The world grows tired of
solid forms in all the arts. I struck a new idea myself years ago. I was
not surprised at it. I was always expecting it would happen. A person
who has suffered disappointment for many years loses confidence, and I
thought I had better make inquiries before I exploited my new idea of
doing a drama in the form of a dream, so I wrote to a great authority on
knowledge of all kinds, and asked him whether it was new.</p>
<p>I could depend upon him. He lived in my dear home in America–that
dear home, dearer to me through taxes. He sent me a list of plays in
which that old device had been used, and he said that there was also a
modern lot. He travelled back to China and to a play dated two thousand
six hundred years before the Christian era. He said he would follow it
up with a list of the previous plays of the kind, and in his innocence
would have carried them back to the Flood.</p>
<p>That is the most discouraging thing that has ever happened to me in
my dramatic career. I have done a world of good in a silent and private
way, and have furnished Sir Henry Irving with plays and plays and plays.
What has he achieved through that influence. See where he stands now –on
the summit of his art in two worlds and it was I who put him there –that
partly put him there.</p>
<p>I need not enlarge upon the influence the drama has exerted upon
civilization. It has made good morals entertaining. I am to be followed
by Mr. Pinero. I conceive that we stand at the head of the profession.
He has not written as many plays as I have, but he has lead that
God-given talent, which I lack, of working hem off on the manager. I
couple his name with this toast, and add the hope that his influence
will be supported in exercising his masterly handicraft in that great
gift, and that he will long live to continue his fine work.</p>
<p>DINNER TO HAMILTON W. MABIE</p>
<p>ADDRESS DELIVERED APRIL 29, 1901</p>
<p>In introducing Mr. Clemens, Doctor Van Dyke said:</p>
<p>“The longer the speaking goes on to-night the more I wonder how I got
this job, and the only explanation I can give for it is that it is the
same kind of compensation for the number of articles I have sent to The
Outlook, to be rejected by Hamilton W. Mabie. There is one man here
to-night that has a job cut out for him that none of you would have
had–a man whose humor has put a girdle of light around the globe, and
whose sense of humor has been an example for all five continents. He is
going to speak to you. Gentlemen, you know him best as Mark Twain.“</p>
<p>MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN,–This man knows now how it feels to be the
chief guest, and if he has enjoyed it he is the first man I have ever
seen in that position that did enjoy it. And I know, by side-remarks
which he made to me before his ordeal came upon him, that he was feeling
as some of the rest of us have felt under the same circumstances. He was
afraid that he would not do himself justice; but he did–to my surprise.
It is a most serious thing to be a chief guest on an occasion like this,
and it is admirable, it is fine. It is a great compliment to a man that
he shall come out of it so gloriously as Mr. Mabie came out of it
tonight–to my surprise. He did it well.</p>
<p>He appears to be editor of The Outlook, and notwithstanding that, I
have every admiration, because when everything is said concerning The
Outlook, after all one must admit that it is frank in its delinquencies,
that it is outspoken in its departures from fact, that it is vigorous in
its mistaken criticisms of men like me. I have lived in this world a
long, long time, and I know you must not judge a man by the editorials
that he puts in his paper. A man is always better than his printed
opinions. A man always reserves to himself on the inside a purity and an
honesty and a justice that are a credit to him, whereas the things that
he prints are just the reverse.</p>
<p>Oh yes, you must not judge a man by what he writes in his paper. Even
in an ordinary secular paper a man must observe some care about it; he
must be better than the principles which he puts in print. And that is
the case with Mr. Mabie. Why, to see what he writes about me and the
missionaries you would think he did not have any principles. But that is
Mr. Mabie in his public capacity. Mr. Mabie in his private capacity is
just as clean a man as I am.</p>
<p>In this very room, a month or two ago, some people admired that
portrait; some admired this, but the great majority fastened on that,
and said, “There is a portrait that is a beautiful piece of art.“ When
that portrait is a hundred years old it will suggest what were the
manners and customs in our time. Just as they talk about Mr. Mabie
to-night, in that enthusiastic way, pointing out the various virtues of
the man and the grace of his spirit, and all that, so was that portrait
talked about. They were enthusiastic, just as we men have been over the
character and the work of Mr. Mabie. And when they were through they
said that portrait, fine as it is, that work, beautiful as it is, that
piece of humanity on that canvas, gracious and fine as it is, does not
rise to those perfections that exist in the man himself. Come up,
Mr. Alexander. [The reference was to James W. Alexander, who happened to
be sitting –beneath the portrait of himself on the wall.] Now, I should
come up and show myself. But he cannot do it, he cannot do it. He was
born that way, he was reared in that way. Let his modesty be an example,
and I wish some of you had it, too. But that is just what I have been
saying –that portrait, fine as it is, is not as fine as the man it
represents, and all the things that have been said about Mr. Mabie, and
certainly they have been very nobly worded and beautiful, still fall
short of the real Mabie.</p>
<p>INTRODUCING NYE AND RILEY</p>
<p>James Whitcomb Riley and Edgar Wilson Nye (Bill Nye) were to give
readings in Tremont Temple, Boston, November, 1888. Mr. Clemens was
induced to introduce Messrs. Riley and Nye. His appearance on the
platform was a surprise to the audience, and when they recognized him
there was a tremendous demonstration.</p>
<p>I am very glad indeed to introduce these young people to you, and at
the same time get acquainted with them myself. I have seen them more
than once for a moment, but have not had the privilege of knowing them
personally as intimately as I wanted to. I saw them first, a great many
years ago, when Mr. Barnum had them, and they were just fresh from Siam.
The ligature was their best hold then, the literature became their best
hold later, when one of them committed an indiscretion, and they had to
cut the old bond to accommodate the sheriff.</p>
<p>In that old former time this one was Chang, that one was Eng. The
sympathy existing between the two was most extraordinary; it was so
fine, so strong, so subtle, that what the one ate the other digested;
when one slept, the other snored; if one sold a thing, the other scooped
the usufruct. This independent and yet dependent action was observable
in all the details of their daily life–I mean this quaint and arbitrary
distribution of originating cause and resulting effect between the two
–between, I may say, this dynamo and the other always motor, or, in
other words, that the one was always the creating force, the other
always the utilizing force; no, no, for while it is true that within
certain well-defined zones of activity the one was always dynamo and the
other always motor, within certain other well-defined zones these
positions became exactly reversed.</p>
<p>For instance, in moral matters Mr. Chang Riley was always dynamo,
Mr. Eng Nye was always motor; for while Mr. Chang Riley had a high–in
fact, an abnormally high and fine moral sense, he had no machinery to
work it with; whereas, Mr. Eng Nye, who hadn’t any moral sense at all,
and hasn’t yet, was equipped with all the necessary plant for putting a
noble deed through, if he could only get the inspiration on reasonable
terms outside.</p>
<p>In intellectual matters, on the other hand, Mr. Eng Nye was always
dynamo, Mr. Chang Riley was always motor; Mr. Eng Nye had a stately
intellect, but couldn’t make it go; Mr. Chang Riley hadn’t, but could.
That is to say, that while Mr. Chang Riley couldn’t think things
himself, he had a marvellous natural grace in setting them down and
weaving them together when his pal furnished the raw material.</p>
<p>Thus, working together, they made a strong team; laboring together,
they could do miracles; but break the circuit, and both were impotent.
It has remained so to this day: they must travel together, hoe, and
plant, and plough, and reap, and sell their public together, or there’s
no result.</p>
<p>I have made this explanation, this analysis, this vivisection, so to
speak, in order that you may enjoy these delightful adventurers
understandingly. When Mr. Eng Nye’s deep and broad and limpid
philosophies flow by in front of you, refreshing all the regions round
about with their gracious floods, you will remember that it isn’t his
water; it’s the other man’s, and he is only working the pump. And when
Mr. Chang Riley enchants your ear, and soothes your spirit, and touches
your heart with the sweet and genuine music of his poetry–as sweet and
as genuine as any that his friends, the birds and the bees, make about
his other friends, the woods and the flowers–you will remember, while
placing justice where justice is due, that it isn’t his music, but the
other man’s–he is only turning the crank.</p>
<p>I beseech for these visitors a fair field, a singleminded, one-eyed
umpire, and a score bulletin barren of goose-eggs if they earn it–and I
judge they will and hope they will. Mr. James Whitcomb Chang Riley will
now go to the bat.</p>
<p>DINNER TO WHITELAW REID</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE DINNER IN HONOR OF AMBASSADOR REID, GIVEN BY THE
PILGRIMS’ CLUB OF NEW YORK ON FEBRUARY 19, 1908</p>
<p>I am very proud to respond to this toast, as it recalls the proudest
day of my life. The delightful hospitality shown me at the time of my
visit to Oxford I shall cherish until I die. In that long and
distinguished career of mine I value that degree above all other honors.
When the ship landed even the stevedores gathered on the shore and gave
an English cheer. Nothing could surpass in my life the pleasure of those
four weeks. No one could pass by me without taking my hand, even the
policemen. I’ve been in all the principal capitals of Christendom in my
life, and have always been an object of interest to policemen. Sometimes
there was suspicion in their eyes, but not always. With their puissant
hand they would hold up the commerce of the world to let me pass.</p>
<p>I noticed in the papers this afternoon a despatch from Washington,
saying that Congress would immediately pass a bill restoring to our gold
coinage the motto “In God We Trust.“ I’m glad of that; I’m glad of that.
I was troubled when that motto was removed. Sure enough, the
prosperities of the whole nation went down in a heap when we ceased to
trust in God in that conspicuously advertised way. I knew there would be
trouble. And if Pierpont Morgan hadn’t stepped in–Bishop Lawrence may
now add to his message to the old country that we are now trusting in
God again. So we can discharge Mr. Morgan from his office with
honor.</p>
<p>Mr. Reid said an hour or so ago something about my ruining my
activities last summer. They are not ruined, they are renewed. I am
stronger now –much stronger. I suppose that the spiritual uplift I
received increased my physical power more than anything I ever had
before. I was dancing last night at 1.30 o’clock.</p>
<p>Mr. Choate has mentioned Mr. Reid’s predecessors. Mr. Choate’s head
is full of history, and some of it is true, too. I enjoyed hearing him
tell about the list of the men who had the place before he did. He
mentioned a long list of those predecessors, people I never heard of
before, and elected five of them to the Presidency by his own vote. I’m
glad and proud to find Mr. Reid in that high position, because he didn’t
look it when I knew him forty years ago. I was talking to Reid the other
day, and he showed me my autograph on an old paper twenty years old. I
didn’t know I had an autograph twenty years ago. Nobody ever asked me
for it.</p>
<p>I remember a dinner I had long ago with Whitelaw Reid and John Hay at
Reid’s expense. I had another last summer when I was in London at the
embassy that Choate blackguards so. I’d like to live there.</p>
<p>Some people say they couldn’t live on the salary, but I could live on
the salary and the nation together. Some of us don’t appreciate what
this country can do. There’s John Hay, Reid, Choate, and me. This is the
only country in the world where youth, talent, and energy can reach such
heights. It shows what we could do without means, and what people can do
with talent and energy when they find it in people like us.</p>
<p>When I first came to New York they were all struggling young men, and
I am glad to see that they have got on in the world. I knew John Hay
when I had no white hairs in my head and more hair than Reid has now.
Those were days of joy and hope. Reid and Hay were on the staff of the
Tribune. I went there once in that old building, and I looked all around
and I finally found a door ajar and looked in. It wasn’t Reid or Hay
there, but it was Horace Greeley. Those were in the days when Horace
Greeley was a king. That was the first time I ever saw him and the
last.</p>
<p>I was admiring him when he stopped and seemed to realize that there
was a fine presence there somewhere. He tried to smile, but he was out
of smiles. He looked at me a moment, and said:</p>
<p>“What in H—do you want?“</p>
<p>He began with that word “H.“ That’s a long word and a profane word. I
don’t remember what the word was now, but I recognized the power of it.
I had never used that language myself, but at that moment I was
converted. It has been a great refuge for me in time of trouble. If a
man doesn’t know that language he can’t express himself on strenuous
occasions. When you have that word at your command let trouble come.</p>
<p>But later Hay rose, and you know what summit Whitelaw Reid has
reached, and you see me. Those two men have regulated troubles of
nations and conferred peace upon mankind. And in my humble way, of which
I am quite vain, I was the principal moral force in all those great
international movements. These great men illustrated what I say. Look at
us great people–we all come from the dregs of society. That’s what can
be done in this country. That’s what this country does for you.</p>
<p>Choate here–he hasn’t got anything to say, but he says it just the
same, and he can do it so felicitously, too. I said long ago he was the
handsomest man America ever produced. May the progress of civilization
always rest on such distinguished men as it has in the past!</p>
<p>ROGERS AND RAILROADS</p>
<p>AT A BANQUET GIVEN MR. H. H. ROGERS BY THE BUSINESS MEN OF NORFOLK,
VA., CELEBRATING THE OPENING OF THE VIRGINIAN RAILWAY, APRIL, 3,
1909</p>
<p>Toastmaster:</p>
<p>“I have often thought that when the time comes, which must come to
all of us, when we reach that Great Way in the Great Beyond, and the
question is propounded, ‘What have you done to gain admission into this
great realm?’ if the answer could be sincerely made, ‘I have made men
laugh,’ it would be the surest passport to a welcome entrance. We have
here to-night one who has made millions laugh–not the loud laughter that
bespeaks the vacant mind, but the laugh of intelligent mirth that helps
the human heart and the human mind. I refer, of course, to Doctor
Clemens. I was going to say Mark Twain, his literary title, which is a
household phrase in more homes than that of any other man, and you know
him best by that dear old title.“</p>
<p>I thank you, Mr. Toastmaster, for the compliment which you have paid
me, and I am sure I would rather have made people laugh than cry, yet in
my time I have made some of them cry; and before I stop entirely I hope
to make some more of them cry. I like compliments. I deal in them
myself. I have listened with the greatest pleasure to the compliments
which the chairman has paid to Mr. Rogers and that road of his to-night,
and I hope some of them are deserved.</p>
<p>It is no small distinction to a man like that to sit here before an
intelligent crowd like this and to be classed with Napoleon and Caesar.
Why didn’t he say that this was the proudest day of his life? Napoleon
and Caesar are dead, and they can’t be here to defend themselves. But
I’m here!</p>
<p>The chairman said, and very truly, that the most lasting thing in the
hands of man are the roads which Caesar built, and it is true that he
built a lot of them; and they are there yet.</p>
<p>Yes, Caesar built a lot of roads in England, and you can find them.
But Rogers has only built one road, and he hasn’t finished that yet. I
like to hear my old friend complimented, but I don’t like to hear it
overdone.</p>
<p>I didn’t go around to-day with the others to see what he is doing. I
will do that in a quiet time, when there is not anything going on, and
when I shall not be called upon to deliver intemperate compliments on a
railroad in which I own no stock.</p>
<p>They proposed that I go along with the committee and help inspect
that dump down yonder. I didn’t go. I saw that dump. I saw that thing
when I was coming in on the steamer, and I didn’t go because I was
diffident, sentimentally diffident, about going and looking at that
thing again –that great, long, bony thing; it looked just like
Mr. Rogers’s foot.</p>
<p>The chairman says Mr. Rogers is full of practical wisdom, and he is.
It is intimated here that he is a very ingenious man, and he, is a very
competent financier. Maybe he is now, but it was not always so. I know
lots of private things in his life which people don’t know, and I know
how he started; and it was not a very good start. I could have done
better myself. The first time he crossed the Atlantic he had just made
the first little strike in oil, and he was so young he did not like to
ask questions. He did not like to appear ignorant. To this day he don’t
like to appear ignorant, but he can look as ignorant as anybody. On
board the ship they were betting on the run of the ship, betting a
couple of shillings, or half a crown, and they proposed that this youth
from the oil regions should bet on the run of the ship. He did not like
to ask what a half-crown was, and he didn’t know; but rather than be
ashamed of himself he did bet half a crown on the run of the ship, and
in bed he could not sleep. He wondered if he could afford that outlay in
case he lost. He kept wondering over it, and said to himself: “A king’s
crown must be worth 0,000, so half a crown would cost 0,000.“ He could
not afford to bet away 0,000 on the run of the ship, so he went up to
the stakeholder and gave him 50 to let him off.</p>
<p>I like to hear Mr. Rogers complimented. I am not stingy in
compliments to him myself. Why, I did it to-day when I sent his wife a
telegram to comfort her. That is the kind of person I am. I knew she
would be uneasy about him. I knew she would be solicitous about what he
might do down here, so I did it to quiet her and to comfort her. I said
he was doing well for a person out of practice. There is nothing like
it. He is like I used to be. There were times when I was
careless–careless in my dress when I got older. You know how
uncomfortable your wife can get when you are going away without her
superintendence. Once when my wife could not go with me (she always went
with me when she could –I always did meet that kind of luck), I was
going to Washington once, a long time ago, in Mr. Cleveland’s first
administration, and she could not go; but, in her anxiety that I should
not desecrate the house, she made preparation. She knew that there was
to be a reception of those authors at the White House at seven o’clock
in the evening. She said, “If I should tell you now what I want to ask
of you, you would forget it before you get to Washington, and,
therefore, I have written it on a card, and you will find it in your
dress–vest pocket when you are dressing at the Arlington–when you are
dressing to see the President.“ I never thought of it again until I was
dressing, and I felt in that pocket and took it out, and it said, in a
kind of imploring way, “Don’t wear your arctics in the White House.“</p>
<p>You complimented Mr. Rogers on his energy, his foresightedness,
complimented him in various ways, and he has deserved those compliments,
although I say it myself; and I enjoy them all. There is one side of
Mr. Rogers that has not been mentioned. If you will leave that to me I
will touch upon that. There was a note in an editorial in one of the
Norfolk papers this morning that touched upon that very thing, that
hidden side of Mr. Rogers, where it spoke of Helen Keller and her
affection for Mr. Rogers, to whom she dedicated her life book. And she
has a right to feel that way, because, without the public knowing
anything about it, he rescued, if I may use that term, that marvellous
girl, that wonderful Southern girl, that girl who was stone deaf, blind,
and dumb from scarlet-fever when she was a baby eighteen months old; and
who now is as well and thoroughly educated as any woman on this planet
at twenty-nine years of age. She is the most marvellous person of her
sex that has existed on this earth since Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>That is not all Mr. Rogers has done; but you never see that side of
his character, because it is never protruding; but he lends a helping
hand daily out of that generous heart of his. You never hear of it. He
is supposed to be a moon which has one side dark and the other bright.
But the other side, though you don’t see it, is not dark; it is bright,
and its rays penetrate, and others do see it who are not God.</p>
<p>I would take this opportunity to tell something that I have never
been allowed to tell by Mr. Rogers, either by my mouth or in print, and
if I don’t look at him I can tell it now.</p>
<p>In 1893, when the publishing company of Charles L. Webster, of which
I was financial agent, failed, it left me heavily in debt. If you will
remember what commerce was at that time you will recall that you could
not sell anything, and could not buy anything, and I was on my back; my
books were not worth anything at all, and I could not give away my
copyrights. Mr. Rogers had long enough vision ahead to say, “Your books
have supported you before, and after the panic is over they will support
you again,“ and that was a correct proposition. He saved my copyrights,
and saved me from financial ruin. He it was who arranged with my
creditors to allow me to roam the face of the earth for four years and
persecute the nations thereof with lectures, promising that at the end
of four years I would pay dollar for dollar. That arrangement was made;
otherwise I would now be living out-of-doors under an umbrella, and a
borrowed one at that.</p>
<p>You see his white mustache and his head trying to get white (he is
always trying to look like me–I don’t blame him for that). These are
only emblematic of his character, and that is all. I say, without
exception, hair and all, he is the whitest man I have ever known.</p>
<p>THE OLD-FASHIONED PRINTER</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE TYPOTHETAE DINNER GIVEN AT DELMONICO’S, JANUARY 18,
1886, COMMEMORATING THE BIRTHDAY OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens responded to the toast “The Compositor.“</p>
<p>The chairman’s historical reminiscences of Gutenberg have caused me
to fall into reminiscences, for I myself am something of an antiquity.
All things change in the procession of years, and it may be that I am
among strangers. It may be that the printer of to-day is not the printer
of thirty-five years ago. I was no stranger to him. I knew him well. I
built his fire for him in the winter mornings; I brought his water from
the village pump; I swept out his office; I picked up his type from
under his stand; and, if he were there to see, I put the good type in
his case and the broken ones among the “hell matter“; and if he wasn’t
there to see, I dumped it all with the “pi“ on the imposing-stone–for
that was the furtive fashion of the cub, and I was a cub. I wetted down
the paper Saturdays, I turned it Sundays–for this was a country weekly;
I rolled, I washed the rollers, I washed the forms, I folded the papers,
I carried them around at dawn Thursday mornings. The carrier was then an
object of interest to all the dogs in town. If I had saved up all the
bites I ever received, I could keep M. Pasteur busy for a year. I
enveloped the papers that were for the mail–we had a hundred town
subscribers and three hundred and fifty country ones; the town
subscribers paid in groceries and the country ones in cabbages and
cord-wood–when they paid at all, which was merely sometimes, and then we
always stated the fact in the paper, and gave them a puff; and if we
forgot it they stopped the paper. Every man on the town list helped edit
the thing–that is, he gave orders as to how it was to be edited;
dictated its opinions, marked out its course for it, and every time the
boss failed to connect he stopped his paper. We were just infested with
critics, and we tried to satisfy them all over. We had one subscriber
who paid cash, and he was more trouble than all the rest. He bought us
once a year, body and soul, for two dollars. He used to modify our
politics every which way, and he made us change our religion four times
in five years. If we ever tried to reason with him, he would threaten to
stop his paper, and, of course, that meant bankruptcy and destruction.
That man used to write articles a column and a half long, leaded long
primer, and sign them “Junius,“ or “Veritas,“ or “Vox Populi,“ or some
other high-sounding rot; and then, after it was set up, he would come in
and say he had changed his mind-which was a gilded figure of speech,
because he hadn’t any–and order it to be left out. We couldn’t afford
“bogus“ in that office, so we always took the leads out, altered the
signature, credited the article to the rival paper in the next village,
and put it in. Well, we did have one or two kinds of “bogus.“ Whenever
there was a barbecue, or a circus, or a baptizing, we knocked off for
half a day, and then to make up for short matter we would “turn over
ads“–turn over the whole page and duplicate it. The other “bogus“ was
deep philosophical stuff, which we judged nobody ever read; so we kept a
galley of it standing, and kept on slapping the same old batches of it
in, every now and then, till it got dangerous. Also, in the early days
of the telegraph we used to economize on the news. We picked out the
items that were pointless and barren of information and stood them on a
galley, and changed the dates and localities, and used them over and
over again till the public interest in them was worn to the bone. We
marked the ads, but we seldom paid any attention to the marks afterward;
so the life of a “td“ ad and a “tf“ ad was equally eternal. I have seen
a “td“ notice of a sheriff’s sale still booming serenely along two years
after the sale was over, the sheriff dead, and the whole circumstance
become ancient history. Most of the yearly ads were patent-medicine
stereotypes, and we used to fence with them.</p>
<p>I can see that printing-office of prehistoric times yet, with its
horse bills on, the walls, its “d“ boxes clogged with tallow, because we
always stood the candle in the “k“ box nights, its towel, which was not
considered soiled until it could stand alone, and other signs and
symbols that marked the establishment of that kind in the Mississippi
Valley; and I can see, also, the tramping “jour,“ who flitted by in the
summer and tarried a day, with his wallet stuffed with one shirt and a
hatful of handbills; for if he couldn’t get any type to set he would do
a temperance lecture. His way of life was simple, his needs not complex;
all he wanted was plate and bed and money enough to get drunk on, and he
was satisfied. But it may be, as I have said, that I am among strangers,
and sing the glories of a forgotten age to unfamiliar ears, so I will
“make even“ and stop.</p>
<p>SOCIETY OF AMERICAN AUTHORS</p>
<p>On November 15, 1900, the society gave a reception to Mr. Clemens,
who came with his wife and daughter. So many members surrounded the
guests that Mr. Clemens asked: “Is this genuine popularity or is it all
a part of a prearranged programme?“</p>
<p>MR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,–It seems a most difficult thing
for any man to say anything about me that is not complimentary. I don’t
know what the charm is about me which makes it impossible for a person
to say a harsh thing about me and say it heartily, as if he was glad to
say it.</p>
<p>If this thing keeps on it will make me believe that I am what these
kind chairmen say of me. In introducing me, Judge Ransom spoke of my
modesty as if he was envious of me. I would like to have one man come
out flat-footed and say something harsh and disparaging of me, even if
it were true. I thought at one time, as the learned judge was speaking,
that I had found that man; but he wound up, like all the others, by
saying complimentary things.</p>
<p>I am constructed like everybody else, and enjoy a compliment as well
as any other fool, but I do like to have the other side presented. And
there is another side. I have a wicked side. Estimable friends who know
all about it would tell you and take a certain delight in telling you
things that I have done, and things further that I have not
repented.</p>
<p>The real life that I live, and the real life that I suppose all of
you live, is a life of interior sin. That is what makes life valuable
and pleasant. To lead a life of undiscovered sin! That is true joy.</p>
<p>Judge Ransom seems to have all the virtues that he ascribes to me.
But, oh my! if you could throw an X-ray through him. We are a pair. I
have made a life-study of trying to appear to be what he seems to think
I am. Everybody believes that I am a monument of all the virtues, but it
is nothing of the sort. I am living two lives, and it keeps me pretty
busy.</p>
<p>Some day there will be a chairman who will forget some of these
merits of mine, and then he will make a speech.</p>
<p>I have more personal vanity than modesty, and twice as much veracity
as the two put together.</p>
<p>When that fearless and forgetful chairman is found there will be
another story told. At the Press Club recently I thought that I had
found him. He started in in the way that I knew I should be painted with
all sincerity, and was leading to things that would not be to my credit;
but when he said that he never read a book of mine I knew at once that
he was a liar, because he never could have had all the wit and
intelligence with which he was blessed unless he had read my works as a
basis.</p>
<p>I like compliments. I like to go home and tell them all over again to
the members of my family. They don’t believe them, but I like to tell
them in the home circle, all the same. I like to dream of them if I
can.</p>
<p>I thank everybody for their compliments, but I don’t think that I am
praised any more than I am entitled to be.</p>
<p>READING-ROOM OPENING</p>
<p>On October 13, 1900, Mr. Clemens made his last address preceding his
departure for America at Kensal Rise, London.</p>
<p>I formally declare this reading-room open, and I think that the
legislature should not compel a community to provide itself with
intelligent food, but give it the privilege of providing it if the
community so desires.</p>
<p>If the community is anxious to have a reading-room it would put its
hand in its pocket and bring out the penny tax. I think it a proof of
the healthy, moral, financial, and mental condition of the community if
it taxes itself for its mental food.</p>
<p>A reading-room is the proper introduction to a library, leading up
through the newspapers and magazines to other literature. What would we
do without newspapers?</p>
<p>Look at the rapid manner in which the news of the Galveston disaster
was made known to the entire world. This reminds me of an episode which
occurred fifteen years ago when I was at church in Hartford,
Connecticut.</p>
<p>The clergyman decided to make a collection for the survivors, if any.
He did not include me among the leading citizens who took the plates
around for collection. I complained to the governor of his lack of
financial trust in me, and he replied: “I would trust you myself–if you
had a bell-punch.“</p>
<p>You have paid me many compliments, and I like to listen to
compliments. I indorse all your chairman has said to you about the union
of England and America. He also alluded to my name, of which I am rather
fond.</p>
<p>A little girl wrote me from New Zealand in a letter I received
yesterday, stating that her father said my proper name was not Mark
Twain but Samuel Clemens, but that she knew better, because Clemens was
the name of the man who sold the patent medicine, and his name was not
Mark. She was sure it was Mark Twain, because Mark is in the Bible and
Twain is in the Bible.</p>
<p>I was very glad to get that expression of confidence in my origin,
and as I now know my name to be a scriptural one, I am not without hopes
of making it worthy.</p>
<p>LITERATURE</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE ROYAL LITERARY FUND BANQUET, LONDON, MAY 4, 1900</p>
<p>Anthony Hope introduced Mr. Clemens to make the response to the toast
“Literature.“</p>
<p>MR. HOPE has been able to deal adequately with this toast without
assistance from me. Still, I was born generous. If he had advanced any
theories that needed refutation or correction I would have attended to
them, and if he had made any statements stronger than those which he is
in the habit of making I would have dealt with them.</p>
<p>In fact, I was surprised at the mildness of his statements. I could
not have made such statements if I had preferred to, because to
exaggerate is the only way I can approximate to the truth. You cannot
have a theory without principles. Principles is another name for
prejudices. I have no prejudices in politics, religion, literature, or
anything else.</p>
<p>I am now on my way to my own country to run for the presidency
because there are not yet enough candidates in the field, and those who
have entered are too much hampered by their own principles, which are
prejudices.</p>
<p>I propose to go there to purify the political atmosphere. I am in
favor of everything everybody is in favor of. What you should do is to
satisfy the whole nation, not half of it, for then you would only be
half a President.</p>
<p>There could not be a broader platform than mine. I am in favor of
anything and everything–of temperance and intemperance, morality and
qualified immorality, gold standard and free silver.</p>
<p>I have tried all sorts of things, and that is why I want to by the
great position of ruler of a country. I have been in turn reporter,
editor, publisher, author, lawyer, burglar. I have worked my way up, and
wish to continue to do so.</p>
<p>I read to-day in a magazine article that Christendom issued last year
fifty-five thousand new books. Consider what that means! Fifty-five
thousand new books meant fifty-four thousand new authors. We are going
to have them all on our hands to take care of sooner or later.
Therefore, double your, subscriptions to the literary fund!</p>
<p>DISAPPEARANCE OF LITERATURE</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE DINNER OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY CLUB, AT SHERRY’S,
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 20, 1900</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens spoke to the toast “The Disappearance of Literature.“
Doctor Gould presided, and in introducing Mr. Clemens said that he (the
speaker), when in Germany, had to do a lot of apologizing for a certain
literary man who was taking what the Germans thought undue liberties
with their language.</p>
<p>It wasn’t necessary for your chairman to apologize for me in Germany.
It wasn’t necessary at all. Instead of that he ought to have impressed
upon those poor benighted Teutons the service I rendered them. Their
language had needed untangling for a good many years. Nobody else seemed
to want to take the job, and so I took it, and I flatter myself that I
made a pretty good job of it. The Germans have an inhuman way of cutting
up their verbs. Now a verb has a hard time enough of it in this world
when it’s all together. It’s downright inhuman to split it up. But
that’s just what those Germans do. They take part of a verb and put it
down here, like a stake, and they take the other part of it and put it
away over yonder like another stake, and between these two limits they
just shovel in German. I maintain that there is no necessity for
apologizing for a man who helped in a small way to stop such
mutilation.</p>
<p>We have heard a discussion to-night on the disappearance of
literature. That’s no new thing. That’s what certain kinds of literature
have been doing for several years. The fact is, my friends, that the
fashion in literature changes, and the literary tailors have to change
their cuts or go out of business. Professor Winchester here, if I
remember fairly correctly what he said, remarked that few, if any, of
the novels produced to-day would live as long as the novels of Walter
Scott. That may be his notion. Maybe he is right; but so far as I am
concerned, I don’t care if they don’t.</p>
<p>Professor Winchester also said something about there being no modern
epics like Paradise Lost. I guess he’s right. He talked as if he was
pretty familiar with that piece of literary work, and nobody would
suppose that he never had read it. I don’t believe any of you have ever
read Paradise Lost, and you don’t want to. That’s something that you
just want to take on trust. It’s a classic, just as Professor Winchester
says, and it meets his definition of a classic–something that everybody
wants to have read and nobody wants to read.</p>
<p>Professor Trent also had a good deal to say about the disappearance
of literature. He said that Scott would outlive all his critics. I guess
that’s true. The fact of the business is, you’ve got to be one of two
ages to appreciate Scott. When you’re eighteen you can read Ivanhoe, and
you want to wait until you are ninety to read some of the rest. It takes
a pretty well-regulated, abstemious critic to live ninety years.</p>
<p>But as much as these two gentlemen have talked about the
disappearance of literature, they didn’t say anything about my books.
Maybe they think they’ve disappeared. If they do, that just shows their
ignorance on the general subject of literature. I am not as young as I
was several years ago, and maybe I’m not so fashionable, but I’d be
willing to take my chances with Mr. Scott to-morrow morning in selling a
piece of literature to the Century Publishing Company. And I haven’t got
much of a pull here, either. I often think that the highest compliment
ever paid to my poor efforts was paid by Darwin through President Eliot,
of Harvard College. At least, Eliot said it was a compliment, and I
always take the opinion of great men like college presidents on all such
subjects as that.</p>
<p>I went out to Cambridge one day a few years ago and called on
President Eliot. In the course of the conversation he said that he had
just returned from England, and that he was very much touched by what he
considered the high compliment Darwin was paying to my books, and he
went on to tell me something like this:</p>
<p>“Do you know that there is one room in Darwin’s house, his bedroom,
where the housemaid is never allowed to touch two things? One is a plant
he is growing and studying while it grows“ (it was one of those
insect-devouring plants which consumed bugs and beetles and things for
the particular delectation of Mr. Darwin) “and the other some books that
lie on the night table at the head of his bed. They are your books,
Mr. Clemens, and Mr. Darwin reads them every night to lull him to
sleep.“</p>
<p>My friends, I thoroughly appreciated that compliment, and considered
it the highest one that was ever paid to me. To be the means of soothing
to sleep a brain teeming with bugs and squirming things like Darwin’s
was something that I had never hoped for, and now that he is dead I
never hope to be able to do it again.</p>
<p>THE NEW YORK PRESS CLUB DINNER</p>
<p>AT THE ANNUAL DINNER, NOVEMBER 13, 1900</p>
<p>Col. William L. Brown, the former editor of the Daily News, as
president of the club, introduced Mr. Clemens as the principal ornament
of American literature.</p>
<p>I must say that I have already begun to regret that I left my gun at
home. I’ve said so many times when a chairman has distressed me with
just such compliments that the next time such a thing occurs I will
certainly use a gun on that chairman. It is my privilege to compliment
him in return. You behold before you a very, very old man. A cursory
glance at him would deceive the most penetrating. His features seem to
reveal a person dead to all honorable instincts–they seem to bear the
traces of all the known crimes, instead of the marks of a life spent for
the most part, and now altogether, in the Sunday-school of a life that
may well stand as an example to all generations that have risen or will
riz–I mean to say, will rise. His private character is altogether
suggestive of virtues which to all appearances he has got. If you
examine his past history you will find it as deceptive as his features,
because it is marked all over with waywardness and misdemeanor–mere
effects of a great spirit upon a weak body–mere accidents of a great
career. In his heart he cherishes every virtue on the list of virtues,
and he practises them all–secretly–always secretly. You all know him so
well that there is no need for him to be introduced here. Gentlemen,
Colonel Brown.</p>
<p>THE ALPHABET AND SIMPLIFIED SPELLING</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE DINNER GIVEN TO MR. CARNEGIE AT THE DEDICATION OF THE
NEW YORK ENGINEERS’ CLUB, DECEMBER 9, 1907</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens was introduced by the president of the club, who, quoting
from the Mark Twain autobiography, recalled the day when the
distinguished writer came to New York with in small change in his
pockets and a 0 bill sewed in his clothes.</p>
<p>It seems to me that I was around here in the neighborhood of the
Public Library about fifty or sixty years ago. I don’t deny the
circumstance, although I don’t see how you got it out of my
autobiography, which was not to be printed until I am dead, unless I’m
dead now. I had that in change, and I remember well the 0 which was
sewed in my coat. I have prospered since. Now I have plenty of money and
a disposition to squander it, but I can’t. One of those trust companies
is taking care of it.</p>
<p>Now, as this is probably the last time that I shall be out after
nightfall this winter, I must say that I have come here with a mission,
and I would make my errand of value.</p>
<p>Many compliments have been paid to Mr. Carnegie to-night. I was
expecting them. They are very gratifying to me.</p>
<p>I have been a guest of honor myself, and I know what Mr. Carnegie is
experiencing now. It is embarrassing to get compliments and compliments
and only compliments, particularly when he knows as well as the rest of
us that on the other side of him there are all sorts of things worthy of
our condemnation.</p>
<p>Just look at Mr. Carnegie’s face. It is fairly scintillating with
fictitious innocence. You would think, looking at him, that he had never
committed a crime in his life. But no–look at his pestiferious
simplified spelling. You can’t any of you imagine what a crime that has
been. Torquemada was nothing to Mr. Carnegie. That old fellow shed some
blood in the Inquisition, but Mr. Carnegie has brought destruction to
the entire race. I know he didn’t mean it to be a crime, but it was,
just the same. He’s got us all so we can’t spell anything.</p>
<p>The trouble with him is that he attacked orthography at the wrong
end. He meant well, but he, attacked the symptoms and not the cause of
the disease. He ought to have gone to work on the alphabet. There’s not
a vowel in it with a definite value, and not a consonant that you can
hitch anything to. Look at the “h’s“ distributed all around. There’s
“gherkin.“ What are you going to do with the “h“ in that? What the
devil’s the use of “h“ in gherkin, I’d like to know. It’s one thing I
admire the English for: they just don’t mind anything about them at
all.</p>
<p>But look at the “pneumatics“ and the “pneumonias“ and the rest of
them. A real reform would settle them once and for all, and wind up by
giving us an alphabet that we wouldn’t have to spell with at all,
instead of this present silly alphabet, which I fancy was invented by a
drunken thief. Why, there isn’t a man who doesn’t have to throw out
about fifteen hundred words a day when he writes his letters because he
can’t spell them! It’s like trying to do a St. Vitus’s dance with wooden
legs.</p>
<p>Now I’ll bet there isn’t a man here who can spell “pterodactyl,“ not
even the prisoner at the bar. I’d like to hear him try once–but not in
public, for it’s too near Sunday, when all extravagant histrionic
entertainments are barred. I’d like to hear him try in private, and when
he got through trying to spell “pterodactyl“ you wouldn’t know whether
it was a fish or a beast or a bird, and whether it flew on its legs or
walked with its wings. The chances are that he would give it tusks and
make it lay eggs.</p>
<p>Let’s get Mr. Carnegie to reform the alphabet, and we’ll pray for him
–if he’ll take the risk. If we had adequate, competent vowels, with a
system of accents, giving to each vowel its own soul and value, so every
shade of that vowel would be shown in its accent, there is not a word in
any tongue that we could not spell accurately. That would be competent,
adequate, simplified spelling, in contrast to the clipping, the hair
punching, the carbuncles, and the cancers which go by the name of
simplified spelling. If I ask you what b-o-w spells you can’t tell me
unless you know which b-o-w I mean, and it is the same with r-o-w,
b-o-r-e, and the whole family of words which were born out of lawful
wedlock and don’t know their own origin.</p>
<p>Now, if we had an alphabet that was adequate and competent, instead
of inadequate and incompetent, things would be different. Spelling
reform has only made it bald-headed and unsightly. There is the whole
tribe of them, “row“ and “read“ and “lead“–a whole family who don’t know
who they are. I ask you to pronounce s-o-w, and you ask me what kind of
a one.</p>
<p>If we had a sane, determinate alphabet, instead of a hospital of
comminuted eunuchs, you would know whether one referred to the act of a
man casting the seed over the ploughed land or whether one wished to
recall the lady hog and the future ham.</p>
<p>It’s a rotten alphabet. I appoint Mr. Carnegie to get after it, and
leave simplified spelling alone.</p>
<p>Simplified spelling brought about sun-spots, the San Francisco
earthquake, and the recent business depression, which we would never
have had if spelling had been left all alone.</p>
<p>Now, I hope I have soothed Mr. Carnegie and made him more comfortable
than he would have been had he received only compliment after
compliment, and I wish to say to him that simplified spelling is all
right, but, like chastity, you can carry it too far.</p>
<p>SPELLING AND PICTURES</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE ANNUAL DINNER OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, AT THE
WALDORF-ASTORIA, SEPTEMBER 18, 1906</p>
<p>I am here to make an appeal to the nations in behalf of the
simplified spelling. I have come here because they cannot all be reached
except through you. There are only two forces that can carry light to
all the corners of the globe–only two–the sun in the heavens and the
Associated Press down here. I may seem to be flattering the sun, but I
do not mean it so; I am meaning only to be just and fair all around. You
speak with a million voices; no one can reach so many races, so many
hearts and intellects, as you–except Rudyard Kipling, and he cannot do
it without your help. If the Associated Press will adopt and use our
simplified forms, and thus spread them to the ends of the earth,
covering the whole spacious planet with them as with a garden of
flowers, our difficulties are at an end.</p>
<p>Every day of the three hundred and sixty-five the only pages of the
world’s countless newspapers that are read by all the human beings and
angels and devils that can read, are these pages that are built out of
Associated Press despatches. And so I beg you, I beseech you–oh, I
implore you to spell them in our simplified forms. Do this daily,
constantly, persistently, for three months–only three months–it is all I
ask. The infallible result?–victory, victory all down the line. For by
that time all eyes here and above and below will have become adjusted to
the change and in love with it, and the present clumsy and ragged forms
will be grotesque to the eye and revolting to the soul. And we shall be
rid of phthisis and phthisic and pneumonia and pneumatics, and
diphtheria and pterodactyl, and all those other insane words which no
man addicted to the simple Christian life can try to spell and not lose
some of the bloom of his piety in the demoralizing attempt. Do not doubt
it. We are chameleons, and our partialities and prejudices change places
with an easy and blessed facility, and we are soon wonted to the change
and happy in it. We do not regret our old, yellow fangs and snags and
tushes after we have worn nice, fresh, uniform store teeth a while.</p>
<p>Do I seem to be seeking the good of the world? That is the idea. It
is my public attitude; privately I am merely seeking my own profit. We
all do it, but it is sound and it is virtuous, for no public interest is
anything other or nobler than a massed accumulation of private
interests. In 1883, when the simplified-spelling movement first tried to
make a noise, I was indifferent to it; more–I even irreverently scoffed
at it. What I needed was an object-lesson, you see. It is the only way
to teach some people. Very well, I got it. At that time I was scrambling
along, earning the family’s bread on magazine work at seven cents a
word, compound words at single rates, just as it is in the dark present.
I was the property of a magazine, a seven-cent slave under a boiler-iron
contract. One day there came a note from the editor requiring me to
write ten pages–on this revolting text: “Considerations concerning the
alleged subterranean holophotal extemporaneousness of the conchyliaceous
superimbrication of the Ornithorhyncus, as foreshadowed by the
unintelligibility of its plesiosaurian anisodactylous aspects.“</p>
<p>Ten pages of that. Each and every word a seventeen-jointed vestibuled
railroad train. Seven cents a word. I saw starvation staring the family
in the face. I went to the editor, and I took a stenographer along so as
to have the interview down in black and white, for no magazine editor
can ever remember any part of a business talk except the part that’s got
graft in it for him and the magazine. I said, “Read that text, Jackson,
and let it go on the record; read it out loud.“ He read it:
“Considerations concerning the alleged subterranean holophotal
extemporaneousness of the conchyliaceous superimbrication of the
Ornithorhyncus, as foreshadowed by the unintelligibility of its
plesiosaurian anisodactylous aspects.“</p>
<p>I said, “You want ten pages of those rumbling, great, long, summer
thunderpeals, and you expect to get them at seven cents a peal?“</p>
<p>He said, “A word’s a word, and seven cents is the contract; what are
you going to do about it?“</p>
<p>I said, “Jackson, this is cold-blooded oppression. What’s an average
English word?“</p>
<p>He said, “Six letters.“</p>
<p>I said, “Nothing of the kind; that’s French, and includes the spaces
between the words; an average English word is four letters and a half.
By hard, honest labor I’ve dug all the large words out of my vocabulary
and shaved it down till the average is three letters and a half. I can
put one thousand and two hundred words on your page, and there’s not
another man alive that can come within two hundred of it. My page is
worth eighty-four dollars to me. It takes exactly as long to fill your
magazine page with long words as it does with short ones-four hours.
Now, then, look at the criminal injustice of this requirement of yours.
I am careful, I am economical of my time and labor. For the family’s
sake I’ve got to be so. So I never write ‘metropolis’ for seven cents,
because I can get the same money for ‘city.’ I never write ‘policeman,’
because I can get the same price for ‘cop.’ And so on and so on. I never
write ‘valetudinarian’ at all, for not even hunger and wretchedness can
humble me to the point where I will do a word like that for seven cents;
I wouldn’t do it for fifteen. Examine your obscene text, please; count
the words.“</p>
<p>He counted and said it was twenty-four. I asked him to count the
letters. He made it two hundred and three.</p>
<p>I said, “Now, I hope you see the whole size of your crime. With my
vocabulary I would make sixty words out of those two hundred and five
letters, and get four dollars and twenty cents for it; whereas for your
inhuman twenty-four I would get only one dollar and sixty-eight cents.
Ten pages of these sky-scrapers of yours would pay me only about three
hundred dollars; in my simplified vocabulary the same space and the same
labor would pay me eight hundred and forty dollars. I do not wish to
work upon this scandalous job by the piece. I want to be hired by the
year.“ He coldly refused. I said:</p>
<p>“Then for the sake of the family, if you have no feeling for me, you
ought at least to allow me overtime on that word extemporaneousness.“
Again he coldly refused. I seldom say a harsh word to any one, but I was
not master of myself then, and I spoke right out and called him an
anisodactylous plesiosaurian conchyliaceous Ornithorhyncus, and rotten
to the heart with holoaophotal subterranean extemporaneousness. God
forgive me for that wanton crime; he lived only two hours.</p>
<p>From that day to this I have been a devoted and hard-working member
of the heaven-born institution, the International Association for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Authors, and now I am laboring with Carnegie’s
Simplified Committee, and with my heart in the work . . . .</p>
<p>Now then, let us look at this mighty question reasonably, rationally,
sanely–yes, and calmly, not excitedly. What is the real function, the
essential function, the supreme function, of language? Isn’t it merely
to convey ideas and emotions? Certainly. Then if we can do it with words
of fonetic brevity and compactness, why keep the present cumbersome
forms? But can we? Yes. I hold in my hand the proof of it. Here is a
letter written by a woman, right out of her heart of hearts. I think she
never saw a spelling-book in her life. The spelling is her own. There
isn’t a waste letter in it anywhere. It reduces the fonetics to the last
gasp–it squeezes the surplusage out of every word–there’s no spelling
that can begin with it on this planet outside of the White House. And as
for the punctuation, there isn’t any. It is all one sentence, eagerly
and breathlessly uttered, without break or pause in it anywhere. The
letter is absolutely genuine–I have the proofs of that in my possession.
I can’t stop to spell the words for you, but you can take the letter
presently and comfort your eyes with it. I will read the letter:</p>
<p>“Miss dear freind I took some Close into the armerry and give them to
you to Send too the suffrers out to California and i Hate to treble you
but i got to have one of them Back it was a black oll wolle Shevyott
With a jacket to Mach trimed Kind of Fancy no 38 Burst measure and palsy
menterry acrost the front And the color i woodent Trubble you but it
belonged to my brothers wife and she is Mad about it i thoght she was
willin but she want she says she want done with it and she was going to
Wear it a Spell longer she ant so free harted as what i am and she Has
got more to do with Than i have having a Husband to Work and slave For
her i gels you remember Me I am shot and stout and light complected i
torked with you quite a spell about the suffrars and said it was orful
about that erth quake I shoodent wondar if they had another one rite off
seeine general Condision of the country is Kind of Explossive i hate to
take that Black dress away from the suffrars but i will hunt round And
see if i can get another One if i can i will call to the armerry for it
if you will jest lay it asside so no more at present from your True
freind</p>
<p>“i liked your appearance very Much“</p>
<p>Now you see what simplified spelling can do.</p>
<p>It can convey any fact you need to convey; and it can pour out
emotions like a sewer. I beg you, I beseech you, to adopt our spelling,
and print all your despatches in it.</p>
<p>Now I wish to say just one entirely serious word:</p>
<p>I have reached a time of life, seventy years and a half, where none
of the concerns of this world have much interest for me personally. I
think I can speak dispassionately upon this matter, because in the
little while that I have got to remain here I can get along very well
with these old-fashioned forms, and I don’t propose to make any trouble
about it at all. I shall soon be where they won’t care how I spell so
long as I keep the Sabbath.</p>
<p>There are eighty-two millions of us people that use this orthography,
and it ought to be simplified in our behalf, but it is kept in its
present condition to satisfy one million people who like to have their
literature in the old form. That looks to me to be rather selfish, and
we keep the forms as they are while we have got one million people
coming in here from foreign countries every year and they have got to
struggle with this orthography of ours, and it keeps them back and
damages their citizenship for years until they learn to spell the
language, if they ever do learn. This is merely sentimental
argument.</p>
<p>People say it is the spelling of Chaucer and Spencer and Shakespeare
and a lot of other people who do not know how to spell anyway, and it
has been transmitted to us and we preserved it and wish to preserve it
because of its ancient and hallowed associations.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t see that there is any real argument about that. If that
argument is good, then it would be a good argument not to banish the
flies and the cockroaches from hospitals because they have been there so
long that the patients have got used to them and they feel a tenderness
for them on account of the associations. Why, it is like preserving a
cancer in a family because it is a family cancer, and we are bound to it
by the test of affection and reverence and old, mouldy antiquity.</p>
<p>I think that this declaration to improve this orthography of ours is
our family cancer, and I wish we could reconcile ourselves to have it
cut out and let the family cancer go.</p>
<p>Now, you see before you the wreck and ruin of what was once a young
person like yourselves. I am exhausted by the heat of the day. I must
take what is left of this wreck and run out of your presence and carry
it away to my home and spread it out there and sleep the sleep of the
righteous. There is nothing much left of me but my age and my
righteousness, but I leave with you my love and my blessing, and may you
always keep your youth.</p>
<p>BOOKS AND BURGLARS</p>
<p>ADDRESS TO THE REDDING (CONN.) LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, OCTOBER 28,
1908</p>
<p>Suppose this library had been in operation a few weeks ago, and the
burglars who happened along and broke into my house–taking a lot of
things they didn’t need, and for that matter which I didn’t need–had
first made entry into this institution.</p>
<p>Picture them seated here on the floor, poring by the light of their
dark-lanterns over some of the books they found, and thus absorbing
moral truths and getting a moral uplift. The whole course of their lives
would have been changed. As it was, they kept straight on in their
immoral way and were sent to jail.</p>
<p>For all we know, they may next be sent to Congress.</p>
<p>And, speaking of burglars, let us not speak of them too harshly. Now,
I have known so many burglars–not exactly known, but so many of them
have come near me in my various dwelling-places, that I am disposed to
allow them credit for whatever good qualities they possess.</p>
<p>Chief among these, and, indeed, the only one I just now think of, is
their great care while doing business to avoid disturbing people’s
sleep.</p>
<p>Noiseless as they may be while at work, however, the effect of their
visitation is to murder sleep later on.</p>
<p>Now we are prepared for these visitors. All sorts of alarm devices
have been put in the house, and the ground for half a mile around it has
been electrified. The burglar who steps within this danger zone will set
loose a bedlam of sounds, and spring into readiness for action our
elaborate system of defences. As for the fate of the trespasser, do not
seek to know that. He will never be heard of more.</p>
<p>AUTHORS’ CLUB</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE DINNER GIVEN IN HONOR OF MR. CLEMENS, LONDON, JUNE,
1899</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens was introduced by Sir Walter Besant.</p>
<p>It does not embarrass me to hear my books praised so much. It only
pleases and delights me. I have not gone beyond the age when
embarrassment is possible, but I have reached the age when I know how to
conceal it. It is such a satisfaction to me to hear Sir Walter Besant,
who is much more capable than I to judge of my work, deliver a judgment
which is such a contentment to my spirit.</p>
<p>Well, I have thought well of the books myself, but I think more of
them now. It charms me also to hear Sir Spencer Walpole deliver a
similar judgment, and I shall treasure his remarks also. I shall not
discount the praises in any possible way. When I report them to my
family they shall lose nothing. There are, however, certain heredities
which come down to us which our writings of the present day may be
traced to. I, for instance, read the Walpole Letters when I was a boy. I
absorbed them, gathered in their grace, wit, and humor, and put them
away to be used by-and-by. One does that so unconsciously with things
one really likes. I am reminded now of what use those letters have been
to me.</p>
<p>They must not claim credit in America for what was really written in
another form so long ago. They must only claim that I trimmed this,
that, and the other, and so changed their appearance as to make them
seem to be original. You now see what modesty I have in stock. But it
has taken long practice to get it there.</p>
<p>But I must not stand here talking. I merely meant to get up and give
my thanks for the pleasant things that preceding speakers have said of
me. I wish also to extend my thanks to the Authors’ Club for
constituting me a member, at a reasonable price per year, and for giving
me the benefit of your legal adviser.</p>
<p>I believe you keep a lawyer. I have always kept a lawyer, too, though
I have never made anything out of him. It is service to an author to
have a lawyer. There is something so disagreeable in having a personal
contact with a publisher. So it is better to work through a lawyer–and
lose your case. I understand that the publishers have been meeting
together also like us. I don’t know what for, but possibly they are
devising new and mysterious ways for remunerating authors. I only wish
now to thank you for electing me a member of this club–I believe I have
paid my dues–and to thank you again for the pleasant things you have
said of me.</p>
<p>Last February, when Rudyard Kipling was ill in America, the sympathy
which was poured out to him was genuine and sincere, and I believe that
which cost Kipling so much will bring England and America closer
together. I have been proud and pleased to see this growing affection
and respect between the two countries. I hope it will continue to grow,
and, please God, it will continue to grow. I trust we authors will leave
to posterity, if we have nothing else to leave, a friendship between
England and America that will count for much. I will now confess that I
have been engaged for the past eight days in compiling a publication. I
have brought it here to lay at your feet. I do not ask your indulgence
in presenting it, but for your applause.</p>
<p>Here it is: “Since England and America may be joined together in
Kipling, may they not be severed in ‘Twain.’“</p>
<p>BOOKSELLERS</p>
<p>Address at banquet on Wednesday evening, May 20, 1908, of the
American Booksellers’ Association, which included most of the leading
booksellers of America, held at the rooms of the Aldine Association, New
York.</p>
<p>This annual gathering of booksellers from all over America comes
together ostensibly to eat and drink, but really to discuss, business;
therefore I am required to, talk shop. I am required to furnish a
statement of the indebtedness under which I lie to you gentlemen for
your help in enabling me to earn my living. For something over forty
years I have acquired my bread by print, beginning with The Innocents
Abroad, followed at intervals of a year or so by Roughing It, Tom
Sawyer, Gilded Age, and so on. For thirty-six years my books were sold
by subscription. You are not interested in those years, but only in the
four which have since followed. The books passed into the hands of my
present publishers at the beginning of 1900, and you then became the
providers of my diet. I think I may say, without flattering you, that
you have done exceedingly well by me. Exceedingly well is not too strong
a phrase, since the official statistics show that in four years you have
sold twice as many volumes of my venerable books as my contract with my
publishers bound you and them to sell in five years. To your sorrow you
are aware that frequently, much too frequently, when a book gets to be
five or ten years old its annual sale shrinks to two or three hundred
copies, and after an added ten or twenty years ceases to sell. But you
sell thousands of my moss-backed old books every year–the youngest of
them being books that range from fifteen to twenty-seven years old, and
the oldest reaching back to thirty-five and forty.</p>
<p>By the terms of my contract my publishers had to account to me for,
50,000 volumes per year for five years, and pay me for them whether they
sold them or not. It is at this point that you gentlemen come in, for it
was your business to unload 250,000 volumes upon the public in five
years if you possibly could. Have you succeeded? Yes, you have–and more.
For in four years, with a year still to spare, you have sold the 250,000
volumes, and 240,000 besides.</p>
<p>Your sales have increased each year. In the first year you sold
90,328; in the second year, 104,851; in the third, 133,975; in the
fourth year –which was last year–you sold 160,000. The aggregate for the
four years is 500,000 volumes, lacking 11,000.</p>
<p>Of the oldest book, The Innocents Abroad,–now forty years old–you
sold upward of 46,000 copies in the four years; of Roughing It–now
thirty-eight years old; I think–you sold 40,334; of Tom Sawyer, 41,000.
And so on.</p>
<p>And there is one thing that is peculiarly gratifying to me: the
Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc is a serious book; I wrote it for
love, and never expected it to sell, but you have pleasantly
disappointed me in that matter. In your hands its sale has increased
each year. In 1904 you sold 1726 copies; in 1905, 2445; in 1906, 5381;
and last year, 6574.</p>
<p>“MARK TWAIN’S FIRST APPEARANCE“</p>
<p>On October 5, 1906, Mr. Clemens, following a musical recital by his
daughter in Norfolk, Conn., addressed her audience on the subject of
stage-fright. He thanked the people for making things as easy as
possible for his daughter’s American debut as a contralto, and then told
of his first experience before the public.</p>
<p>My heart goes out in sympathy to any one who is making his first
appearance before an audience of human beings. By a direct process of
memory I go back forty years, less one month–for I’m older than I
look.</p>
<p>I recall the occasion of my first appearance. San Francisco knew me
then only as a reporter, and I was to make my bow to San Francisco as a
lecturer. I knew that nothing short of compulsion would get me to the
theatre. So I bound myself by a hard-and-fast contract so that I could
not escape. I got to the theatre forty-five minutes before the hour set
for the lecture. My knees were shaking so that I didn’t know whether I
could stand up. If there is an awful, horrible malady in the world, it
is stage-fright-and seasickness. They are a pair. I had stage-fright
then for the first and last time. I was only seasick once, too. It was
on a little ship on which there were two hundred other passengers.
I–was–sick. I was so sick that there wasn’t any left for those other two
hundred passengers.</p>
<p>It was dark and lonely behind the scenes in that theatre, and I
peeked through the little peekholes they have in theatre curtains and
looked into the big auditorium. That was dark and empty, too. By-and-by
it lighted up, and the audience began to arrive.</p>
<p>I had got a number of friends of mine, stalwart men, to sprinkle
themselves through the audience armed with big clubs. Every time I said
anything they could possibly guess I intended to be funny they were to
pound those clubs on the floor. Then there was a kind lady in a box up
there, also a good friend of mine, the wife of the Governor. She was to
watch me intently, and whenever I glanced toward her she was going to
deliver a gubernatorial laugh that would lead the whole audience into
applause.</p>
<p>At last I began. I had the manuscript tucked under a United States
flag in front of me where I could get at it in case of need. But I
managed to get started without it. I walked up and down–I was young in
those days and needed the exercise–and talked and talked.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the speech I had placed a gem. I had put in a
moving, pathetic part which was to get at the hearts and souls of my
hearers. When I delivered it they did just what I hoped and expected.
They sat silent and awed. I had touched them. Then I happened to glance
up at the box where the Governor’s wife was–you know what happened.</p>
<p>Well, after the first agonizing five minutes, my stage-fright left
me, never to return. I know if I was going to be hanged I could get up
and make a good showing, and I intend to. But I shall never forget my
feelings before the agony left me, and I got up here to thank you for
her for helping my daughter, by your kindness, to live through her first
appearance. And I want to thank you for your appreciation of her
singing, which is, by-the-way, hereditary.</p>
<p>MORALS AND MEMORY</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens was the guest of honor at a reception held at Barnard
College (Columbia University), March 7, 1906, by the Barnard Union. One
of the young ladies presented Mr. Clemens, and thanked him for his
amiability in coming to make them an address. She closed with the
expression of the great joy it gave her fellow-collegians, “because we
all love you.“</p>
<p>If any one here loves me, she has my sincere thanks. Nay, if any one
here is so good as to love me–why, I’ll be a brother to her. She shall
have my sincere, warm, unsullied affection. When I was coming up in the
car with the very kind young lady who was delegated to show me the way,
she asked me what I was going to talk about. And I said I wasn’t sure. I
said I had some illustrations, and I was going to bring them in. I said
I was certain to give those illustrations, but that I hadn’t the
faintest notion what they were going to illustrate.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve been thinking it over in this forest glade [indicating the
woods of Arcady on the scene setting], and I’ve decided to work them in
with something about morals and the caprices of memory. That seems to me
to be a pretty good subject. You see, everybody has a memory and it’s
pretty sure to have caprices. And, of course, everybody has morals.</p>
<p>It’s my opinion that every one I know has morals, though I wouldn’t
like to ask. I know I have. But I’d rather teach them than practice them
any day. “Give them to others“–that’s my motto. Then you never have any
use for them when you’re left without. Now, speaking of the caprices of
memory in general, and of mine in particular, it’s strange to think of
all the tricks this little mental process plays on us. Here we’re
endowed with a faculty of mind that ought to be more supremely
serviceable to us than them all. And what happens? This memory of ours
stores up a perfect record of the most useless facts and anecdotes and
experiences. And all the things that we ought to know–that we need to
know–that we’d profit by knowing–it casts aside with the careless
indifference of a girl refusing her true lover. It’s terrible to think
of this phenomenon. I tremble in all my members when I consider all the
really valuable things that I’ve forgotten in seventy years–when I
meditate upon the caprices of my memory.</p>
<p>There’s a bird out in California that is one perfect symbol of the
human memory. I’ve forgotten the bird’s name (just because it would be
valuable for me to know it–to recall it to your own minds, perhaps).</p>
<p>But this fool of a creature goes around collecting the most
ridiculous things you can imagine and storing them up. He never selects
a thing that could ever prove of the slightest help to him; but he goes
about gathering iron forks, and spoons, and tin cans, and broken
mouse-traps –all sorts of rubbish that is difficult for him to carry and
yet be any use when he gets it. Why, that bird will go by a gold watch
to bring back one of those patent cake-pans.</p>
<p>Now, my mind is just like that, and my mind isn’t very different from
yours–and so our minds are just like that bird. We pass by what would be
of inestimable value to us, and pack our memories with the most trivial
odds and ends that never by any chance; under any circumstances
whatsoever, could be of the slightest use to any one.</p>
<p>Now, things that I have remembered are constantly popping into my
head. And I am repeatedly startled by the vividness with which they
recur to me after the lapse of years and their utter uselessness in
being remembered at all.</p>
<p>I was thinking over some on my way up here. They were the
illustrations I spoke about to the young lady on the way up. And I’ve
come to the conclusion, curious though it is, that I can use every one
of these freaks of memory to teach you all a lesson. I’m convinced that
each one has its moral. And I think it’s my duty to hand the moral on to
you.</p>
<p>Now, I recall that when I was a boy I was a good boy–I was a very
good boy. Why, I was the best boy in my school. I was the best boy in
that little Mississippi town where I lived. The population was only
about twenty million. You may not believe it, but I was the best boy in
that State–and in the United States, for that matter.</p>
<p>But I don’t know why I never heard any one say that but myself. I
always recognized it. But even those nearest and dearest to me couldn’t
seem to see it. My mother, especially, seemed to think there was
something wrong with that estimate. And she never got over that
prejudice.</p>
<p>Now, when my mother got to be eighty-five years old her memory failed
her. She forgot little threads that hold life’s patches of meaning
together. She was living out West then, and I went on to visit her.</p>
<p>I hadn’t seen my mother in a year or so. And when I got there she
knew my face; knew I was married; knew I had a family, and that I was
living with them. But she couldn’t, for the life of her, tell my name or
who I was. So I told her I was her boy.</p>
<p>“But you don’t live with me,“ she said.</p>
<p>“No,“ said I, “I’m living in Rochester.“</p>
<p>“What are you doing there?“</p>
<p>“Going to school.“</p>
<p>“Large school?“</p>
<p>“Very large.“</p>
<p>“All boys?“</p>
<p>“All boys.“</p>
<p>“And how do you stand?“ said my mother.</p>
<p>“I’m the best boy in that school,“ I answered.</p>
<p>“Well,“ said my mother, with a return of her old fire, “I’d like to
know what the other boys are like.“</p>
<p>Now, one point in this story is the fact that my mother’s mind went
back to my school days, and remembered my little youthful self-prejudice
when she’d forgotten everything else about me.</p>
<p>The other point is the moral. There’s one there that you will find if
you search for it.</p>
<p>Now, here’s something else I remember. It’s about the first time I
ever stole a watermelon. “Stole“ is a strong word. Stole? Stole? No, I
don’t mean that. It was the first time I ever withdrew a watermelon. It
was the first time I ever extracted a watermelon. That is exactly the
word I want–“extracted.“ It is definite. It is precise. It perfectly
conveys my idea. Its use in dentistry connotes the delicate shade of
meaning I am looking for. You know we never extract our own teeth.</p>
<p>And it was not my watermelon that I extracted. I extracted that
watermelon from a farmer’s wagon while he was inside negotiating with an
other customer. I carried that watermelon to one of the secluded
recesses of the lumber-yard, and there I broke it open.</p>
<p>It was a green watermelon.</p>
<p>Well, do you know when I saw that I began to feel sorry–sorry–sorry.
It seemed to me that I had done wrong. I reflected deeply. I reflected
that I was young–I think I was just eleven. But I knew that though
immature I did not lack moral advancement. I knew what a boy ought to do
who had extracted a watermelon–like that.</p>
<p>I considered George Washington, and what action he would have taken
under similar circumstances. Then I knew there was just one thing to
make me feel right inside, and that was–Restitution.</p>
<p>So I said to myself: “I will do that. I will take that green
watermelon back where I got it from.“ And the minute I had said it I
felt that great moral uplift that comes to you when you’ve made a noble
resolution.</p>
<p>So I gathered up the biggest fragments, and I carried them back to
the farmer’s wagon, and I restored the watermelon–what was left of it.
And I made him give me a good one in place of it, too.</p>
<p>And I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself going around working
off his worthless, old, green watermelons on trusting purchasers who had
to rely on him. How could they tell from the outside whither the melons
were good or not? That was his business. Arid if he didn’t reform, I
told him I’d see that he didn’t get any more of my trade–nor anybody,
else’s I knew, if I could help it.</p>
<p>You know that man was as contrite as a revivalist’s last convert. He
said he was all broken up to think I’d gotten a green watermelon. He
promised the he would never carry another green watermelon if he starved
for it. And he drove off–a better man.</p>
<p>Now, do you see what I did for that man? He was on a downward path,
and I rescued him. But all I got out of it was a watermelon.</p>
<p>Yet I’d rather have that memory–just that memory of the good I did
for that depraved farmer–than all the material gain you can think of.
Look at the lesson he got! I never got anything like that from it. But I
ought to be satisfied: I was only eleven years old, but I secured
everlasting benefit to other people.</p>
<p>The moral in this is perfectly clear, and I think there’s one in they
next memory I’m going to tell you about.</p>
<p>To go back to my childhood, there’s another little incident that
comes to me from which you can draw even another moral. It’s about one
of the times I went fishing. You see, in our house there was a sort of
family prejudice against going fishing if you hadn’t permission. But it
would frequently be bad judgment to ask. So I went fishing secretly, as
it were–way up the Mississippi. It was an exquisitely happy trip, I
recall, with a very pleasant sensation.</p>
<p>Well, while I was away there was a tragedy in our town. A stranger,
stopping over on his way East from California; was stabbed to death in
an unseemly brawl.</p>
<p>Now; my father was justice of the peace, and because he was justice
of the peace he was coroner; and since he was coroner he was also
constable; and being constable he vas sheriff; and out of consideration
for his holding the office of sheriff he was likewise county clerk and a
dozen other officials I don’t think of just this minute.</p>
<p>I thought he had power of life or death, only he didn’t use it over
other boys. He was sort of an austere man. Somehow I didn’t like being
round him when I’d done anything he, disapproved of. So that’s the
reason I wasn’t often around.</p>
<p>Well, when this gentleman got knifed they communicated with the
proper authority; the coroner, and they laid, the corpse out in the
coroner’s office–our front sitting-room–in preparation for the inquest
the next morning.</p>
<p>About 9 or 10 o’clock I got back from fishing. It was a little too
late for me to be received by my folks, so I took my shoes off and
slipped noiselessly up the back way to the sitting-room. I was very
tired, and I didn’t wish to disturb my people. So I groped my way to the
sofa and lay down.</p>
<p>Now, I didn’t know anything of what had happened during my absence.
But I was sort of nervous on my own account-afraid of being caught, and
rather dubious about the morning affair. And I had been lying there a
few moments when my eyes gradually got used to the darkness, and I
became aware of something on the other side of the room.</p>
<p>It was something foreign to the apartment. It had an uncanny
appearance. And I sat up looking very hard, and wondering what in heaven
this long, formless, vicious-looking thing might be.</p>
<p>First I thought I’d go and see. Then I thought, “Never mind
that.“</p>
<p>Mind you, I had no cowardly sensations whatever, but it didn’t seem
exactly prudent to investigate. But I somehow couldn’t keep my eyes off
the thing. And the more I looked at it the more disagreeably it grew on
me. But I was resolved to play the man. So I decided to turn over and
count a hundred, and let the patch of moonlight creep up and show me
what the dickens it was.</p>
<p>I turned over and tried to count, but I couldn’t keep my mind on it.
I kept thinking of that grewsome mass. I was losing count all the time,
and going back and beginning over again. Oh no; I wasn’t frightened
–just annoyed. But by the time I’d gotten to the century mark I turned
cautiously over and opened my eyes with great fortitude.</p>
<p>The moonlight revealed to me a marble-white human hand. Well, maybe I
wasn’t embarrassed! But then that changed to a creepy feeling again, and
I thought I’d try the counting again. I don’t know how many hours or
weeks it was that I lay there counting hard. But the moonlight crept up
that white arm, and it showed me a lead face and a terrible wound over
the heart.</p>
<p>I could scarcely say that I was terror-stricken or anything like
that. But somehow his eyes interested me so that I went right out of the
window. I didn’t need the sash. But it seemed easier to take it than
leave it behind.</p>
<p>Now, let that teach you a lesson–I don’t know just what it is. But at
seventy years old I find that memory of peculiar value to me. I have
been unconsciously guided by it all these years. Things that seemed
pigeon-holed and remote are a perpetual influence. Yes, you’re taught in
so many ways. And you’re so felicitously taught when you don’t know
it.</p>
<p>Here’s something else that taught me a good deal.</p>
<p>When I was seventeen I was very bashful, and a sixteen-year-old girl
came to stay a week with us. She was a peach, and I was seized with a
happiness not of this world.</p>
<p>One evening my mother suggested that, to entertain her, I take her to
the theatre. I didn’t really like to, because I was seventeen and
sensitive about appearing in the streets with a girl. I couldn’t see my
way to enjoying my delight in public. But we went.</p>
<p>I didn’t feel very happy. I couldn’t seem to keep my mind on the
play. I became conscious, after a while, that that was due less to my
lovely company than my boots. They were sweet to look upon, as smooth as
skin, but fitted ten time as close. I got oblivious to the play and the
girl and the other people and everything but my boots until–I hitched
one partly off. The sensation was sensuously perfect: I couldn’t help
it. I had to get the other off, partly. Then I was obliged to get them
off altogether, except that I kept my feet in the legs so they couldn’t
get away.</p>
<p>From that time I enjoyed the play. But the first thing I knew the
curtain came down, like that, without my notice, and–I hadn’t any boots
on. What’s more, they wouldn’t go on. I tugged strenuously. And the
people in our row got up and fussed and said things until the peach and
I simply had to move on.</p>
<p>We moved–the girl on one arm and the boots under the other.</p>
<p>We walked home that way, sixteen blocks, with a retinue a mile long:
Every time we passed a lamp-post, death gripped one at the throat. But
we, got home–and I had on white socks.</p>
<p>If I live to be nine hundred and ninety-nine years old I don’t
suppose I could ever forget that walk. I, remember, it about as keenly
as the chagrin I suffered on another occasion.</p>
<p>At one time in our domestic history we had a colored butler who had a
failing. He could never remember to ask people who came to the door to
state their business. So I used to suffer a good many calls
unnecessarily.</p>
<p>One morning when I was especially busy he brought me a card engraved
with a name I did not know. So I said, “What does he wish to see me
for?“ and Sylvester said, “Ah couldn’t ask him, sah; he, wuz a
genlinun.“ “Return instantly,“ I thundered, “and inquire his mission.
Ask him what’s his game.“ Well, Sylvester returned with the announcement
that he had lightning-rods to sell. “Indeed,“ said I, “things are coming
to a fine pass when lightning-rod agents send up engraved cards.“ “He
has pictures,“ added Sylvester. “Pictures, indeed! He maybe peddling
etchings. Has he a Russia leather case?“ But Sylvester was too
frightened to remember. I said; “I am going down to make it hot for that
upstart!“</p>
<p>I went down the stairs, working up my temper all the way. When I got
to the parlor I was in a fine frenzy concealed beneath a veneer of
frigid courtesy. And when I looked in the door, sure enough he had a
Russia leather case in his hand. But I didn’t happen to notice that it
was our Russia leather case.</p>
<p>And if you’d believe me, that man was sitting with a whole gallery of
etchings spread out before him. But I didn’t happen to notice that they
were our etchings, spread out by some member of my family for some
unguessed purpose.</p>
<p>Very curtly I asked the gentleman his business. With a surprised,
timid manner he faltered that he had met my wife and daughter at
Onteora, and they had asked him to call. Fine lie, I thought, and I
froze him.</p>
<p>He seemed to be kind of non-plussed, and sat there fingering the
etchings in the case until I told him he needn’t bother, because we had
those. That pleased him so much that he leaned over, in an embarrassed
way, to pick up another from the floor. But I stopped him. I said,
“We’ve got that, too.“ He seemed pitifully amazed, but I was
congratulating myself on my great success.</p>
<p>Finally the gentleman asked where Mr. Winton lived; he’d met him in
the mountains, too. So I said I’d show him gladly. And I did on the
spot. And when he was gone I felt queer, because there were all his
etchings spread out on the floor.</p>
<p>Well, my wife came in and asked me who had been in. I showed her the
card, and told her all exultantly. To my dismay she nearly fainted. She
told me he had been a most kind friend to them in the country, and had
forgotten to tell me that he was expected our way. And she pushed me out
of the door, and commanded me to get over to the Wintons in a hurry and
get him back.</p>
<p>I came into the drawing-room, where Mrs. Winton was sitting up very
stiff in a chair, beating me at my own game. Well, I began, to put
another light on things. Before many seconds Mrs. Winton saw it was time
to change her temperature. In five minutes I had asked the man to
luncheon, and she to dinner, and so on.</p>
<p>We made that fellow change his trip and stay a week, and we gave him
the time of his life. Why, I don’t believe we let him get sober the
whole time.</p>
<p>I trust that you will carry away some good thought from these lessons
I have given you, and that the memory of them will inspire you to higher
things, and elevate you to plans far above the old–and–and–</p>
<p>And I tell you one thing, young ladies: I’ve had a better time with
you to-day than with that peach fifty-three years ago.</p>
<p>QUEEN VICTORIA</p>
<p>ADDRESS TO THE BRITISH SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES CLUB, AT DELMONICO’S,
MONDAY, MAY 25, IN HONOR OF QUEEN VICTORIA’S BIRTHDAY</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens told the story of his duel with a rival editor: how he
practised firing at a barn door and failed to hit it, but a friend of
his took off the head of a little bird at thirty-five yards and
attributed the shot to Mark twain. The duel did not take place.
Mr. Clemens continued as follows:</p>
<p>It also happened that I was the means of stopping duelling in Nevada,
for a law was passed sending all duellists to jail for two years, and
the Governor, hearing of my marksmanship, said that if he got me I
should go to prison for the full term. That’s why I left Nevada, and I
have not been there since.</p>
<p>You do me a high honor, indeed, in selecting me to speak of my
country in this commemoration of the birthday of that noble lady whose
life was consecrated to the virtues and the humanities and to the
promotion of lofty ideals, and was a model upon which many a humbler
life was formed and made beautiful while she lived, and upon which many
such lives will still be formed in the generations that are to come–a
life which finds its just image in the star which falls out of its place
in the sky and out of existence, but whose light still streams with
unfaded lustre across the abysses of space long after its fires have
been extinguished at their source.</p>
<p>As a woman the Queen was all that the most exacting standards could
require. As a far-reaching and effective beneficent moral force she had
no peer in her time among either, monarchs or commoners. As a monarch
she was without reproach in her great office. We may not venture,
perhaps, to say so sweeping a thing as this in cold blood about any
monarch that preceded her upon either her own throne or upon any other.
It is a colossal eulogy, but it is justified.</p>
<p>In those qualities of the heart which beget affection in all sorts
and conditions of men she was rich, surprisingly rich, and for this she
will still be remembered and revered in the far-off ages when the
political glories of her reign shall have faded from vital history and
fallen to a place in that scrap-heap of unverifiable odds and ends which
we call tradition. Which is to say, in briefer phrase, that her name
will live always. And with it her character–a fame rare in the history
of thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, since it will not
rest upon harvested selfish and sordid ambitions, but upon love, earned
and freely vouchsafed. She mended broken hearts where she could, but she
broke none.</p>
<p>What she did for us in America in our time of storm and stress we
shall not forget, and whenever we call it to mind we shall always
remember the wise and righteous mind that guided her in it and sustained
and supported her–Prince Albert’s. We need not talk any idle talk here
to-night about either possible or impossible war between the two
countries; there will be no war while we remain sane and the son of
Victoria and Albert sits upon the throne. In conclusion, I believe I may
justly claim to utter the voice of my country in saying that we hold him
in deep honor, and also in cordially wishing him a long life and a happy
reign.</p>
<p>JOAN OF ARC</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE DINNER OF THE SOCIETY OF ILLUSTRATORS, GIVEN AT THE
ALDINE ASSOCIATION CLUB, DECEMBER 22, 1905</p>
<p>Just before Mr. Clemens made his speech, a young woman attired as
Joan of Arc, with a page bearing her flag of battle, courtesied
reverently and tendered Mr. Clemens a laurel wreath on a satin pillow.
He tried to speak, but his voice failed from excess of emotion. “I thank
you!“ he finally exclaimed, and, pulling him self together, he began his
speech.</p>
<p>Now there is an illustration [pointing to the retreating Joan of
Arc]. That is exactly what I wanted–precisely what I wanted–when I was
describing to myself Joan of Arc, after studying her history and her
character for twelve years diligently.</p>
<p>That was the product–not the conventional Joan of Arc. Wherever you
find the conventional Joan of Arc in history she is an offence to
anybody who knows the story of that wonderful girl.</p>
<p>Why, she was–she was almost supreme in several details. She had a
marvellous intellect; she had a great heart, had a noble spirit, was
absolutely pure in her character, her feeling, her language, her words,
her everything–she was only eighteen years old.</p>
<p>Now put that heart into such a breast–eighteen years old–and give it
that masterly intellect which showed in the face, and furnish it with
that almost god-like spirit, and what are you going to have? The
conventional Joan of Arc? Not by any means. That is impossible. I cannot
comprehend any such thing as that.</p>
<p>You must have a creature like that young and fair and beautiful girl
we just saw. And her spirit must look out of the eyes. The figure should
be–the figure should be in harmony with all that, but, oh, what we get
in the conventional picture, and it is always the conventional
picture!</p>
<p>I hope you will allow me to say that your guild, when you take the
conventional, you have got it at second-hand. Certainly, if you had
studied and studied, then you might have something else as a result, but
when you have the common convention you stick to that.</p>
<p>You cannot prevail upon the artist to do it; he always gives you a
Joan of Arc–that lovely creature that started a great career at
thirteen, but whose greatness arrived when she was eighteen; and merely,
because she was a girl he can not see the divinity in her, and so he
paints a peasant, a coarse and lubberly figure–the figure of a
cotton-bale, and he clothes that in the coarsest raiment of the peasant
region just like a fish woman, her hair cropped short like a Russian
peasant, and that face of hers, which should be beautiful and which
should radiate all the glories which are in the spirit and in her heart
that expression in that face is always just the fixed expression of a
ham.</p>
<p>But now Mr. Beard has intimated a moment ago, and so has Sir
Purdon-Clarke also, that the artist, the, illustrator, does not often
get the idea of the man whose book he is illustrating. Here is a very
remarkable instance of the other thing in Mr. Beard, who illustrated a
book of mine. You may never have heard of it. I will tell you about it
now–A Yankee in King Arthur’s Court.</p>
<p>Now, Beard got everything that I put into that book and a little more
besides. Those pictures of Beard’s in that book–oh, from the first page
to the last is one vast sardonic laugh at the trivialities, the
servilities of our poor human race, and also at the professions and the
insolence of priest-craft and king-craft–those creatures that make
slaves of themselves and have not the manliness to shake it off. Beard
put it all in that book. I meant it to be there. I put a lot of it there
and Beard put the rest.</p>
<p>What publisher of mine in Hartford had an eye for the pennies, and he
saved them. He did not waste any on the illustrations. He had a very
good artist–Williams–who had never taken a lesson in drawing. Everything
he did was original. The publisher hired the cheapest wood-engraver he
could find, and in my early books you can see a trace of that. You can
see that if Williams had had a chance he would have made some very good
pictures. He had a good heart and good intentions.</p>
<p>I had a character in the first book he illustrated–The Innocents
Abroad. That was a boy seventeen or eighteen years old–Jack Van
Nostrand–a New York boy, who, to my mind, was a very remarkable
creature. He and I tried to get Williams to understand that boy, and
make a picture of Jack that would be worthy of Jack.</p>
<p>Jack was a most singular combination. He was born and reared in New
York here. He was as delicate in his feelings, as clean and pure and
refined in his feelings as any lovely girl that ever was, but whenever
he expressed a feeling he did it in Bowery slang, and it was a most
curious combination–that delicacy of his and that apparent coarseness.
There was no coarseness inside of Jack at all, and Jack, in the course
of seventeen or eighteen years, had acquired a capital of ignorance that
was marvellous–ignorance of various things, not of all things. For
instance, he did not know anything about the Bible. He had never been in
Sunday-school. Jack got more out of the Holy Land than anybody else,
because the others knew what they were expecting, but it was a land of
surprises to him.</p>
<p>I said in the book that we found him watching a turtle on a log,
stoning that turtle, and he was stoning that turtle because he had read
that “The song of the turtle was heard in the land,“ and this turtle
wouldn’t sing. It sounded absurd, but it was charged on Jack as a fact,
and as he went along through that country he had a proper foil in an old
rebel colonel, who was superintendent and head engineer in a large
Sunday-school in Wheeling, West Virginia. That man was full of
enthusiasm wherever he went, and would stand and deliver himself of
speeches, and Jack would listen to those speeches of the colonel and
wonder.</p>
<p>Jack had made a trip as a child almost across this continent in the
first overland stage-coach. That man’s name who ran that line of
stages–well, I declare that name is gone. Well, names will go.</p>
<p>Halliday–ah, that’s the name–Ben Halliday, your uncle [turning to
Mr. Carnegie]. That was the fellow–Ben Halliday–and Jack was full of
admiration at the prodigious speed that that line of stages made–and it
was good speed–one hundred and twenty-five miles a day, going day and
night, and it was the event of Jack’s life, and there at the Fords of
the Jordan the colonel was inspired to a speech (he was always making a
speech), so he called us up to him. He called up five sinners and three
saints. It has been only lately that Mr. Carnegie beatified me. And he
said: “Here are the Fords of the Jordan–a monumental place. At this very
point, when Moses brought the children of Israel through–he brought the
children of Israel from Egypt through the desert you see them–he guarded
them through that desert patiently, patiently during forty years, and
brought them to this spot safe and sound. There you see–there is the
scene of what Moses did.“</p>
<p>And Jack said: “Moses who?“</p>
<p>“Oh,“ he says, “Jack, you ought not to ask that! Moses, the great
law-giver! Moses, the great patriot! Moses, the great warrior! Moses,
the great guide, who, as I tell you, brought these people through these
three hundred miles of sand in forty years, and landed there safe and
sound.“</p>
<p>Jack said: “There’s nothin’ in that three hundred miles in forty
years. Ben Halliday would have snaked ’em through in thirty–six
hours.“</p>
<p>Well, I was speaking of Jack’s innocence, and it was beautiful. Jack
was not ignorant on all subjects. That boy was a deep student in the
history of Anglo-Saxon liberty, and he was a patriot all the way through
to the marrow. There was a subject that interested him all the time.
Other subjects were of no concern to Jack, but that quaint, inscrutable
innocence of his I could not get Williams to put into the picture.</p>
<p>Yes, Williams wanted to do it. He said: “I will make him as innocent
as a virgin.“ He thought a moment, and then said, “I will make him as
innocent as an unborn virgin;“ which covered the ground.</p>
<p>I was reminded of Jack because I came across a letter to-day which is
over thirty years old that Jack wrote. Jack was doomed to consumption.
He was very long and slim, poor creature; and in a year or two after he
got back from that excursion, to the Holy Land he went on a ride on
horseback through Colorado, and he did not last but a year or two.</p>
<p>He wrote this letter, not to me, but to a friend of mine; and he
said: “I have ridden horseback“–this was three years after–“I hate
ridden horseback four hundred miles through a desert country where you
never see anything but cattle now and then, and now and then a cattle
station–ten miles apart, twenty miles apart. Now you tell Clemens that
in all that stretch of four hundred miles I have seen only two books–the
Bible and ‘Innocents Abroad’. Tell Clemens the Bible was in a very good
condition.“</p>
<p>I say that he had studied, and he had, the real Saxon liberty, the
acquirement of our liberty, and Jack used to repeat some verses–I don’t
know where they came from, but I thought of them to-day when I saw that
letter–that that boy could have been talking of himself in those quoted
lines from that unknown poet:</p>
<p>“For he had sat at Sidney’s feet And walked with him in plain apart,
And through the centuries heard the beat Of Freedom’s march through
Cromwell’s heart.“</p>
<p>And he was that kind of a boy. He should have lived, and yet he
should not have lived, because he died at that early age–he couldn’t
have been more than twenty–he had seen all there was to see in the world
that was worth the trouble of living in it; he had seen all of this
world that is valuable; he had seen all of this world that was illusion,
and illusion, is the only valuable thing in it. He had arrived at that
point where presently the illusions would cease and he would have
entered upon the realities of life, and God help the man that has
arrived at that point.</p>
<p>ACCIDENT INSURANCE–ETC.</p>
<p>DELIVERED IN HARTFORD, AT A DINNER TO CORNELIUS WALFORD, OF
LONDON</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN,–I am glad, indeed, to assist in welcoming the
distinguished guest of this occasion to a city whose fame as an
insurance centre has extended to all lands, and given us the name of
being a quadruple band of brothers working sweetly hand in hand–the
Colt’s arms company making the destruction of our race easy and
convenient, our life-insurance citizens paying for the victims when they
pass away, Mr. Batterson perpetuating their memory with his stately
monuments, and our fire-insurance comrades taking care of their
hereafter. I am glad to assist in welcoming our guest–first, because he
is an Englishman, and I owe a heavy debt of hospitality to certain of
his fellow-countrymen; and secondly, because he is in sympathy with
insurance, and has been the means of making many other men cast their
sympathies in the same direction.</p>
<p>Certainly there is no nobler field for human effort than the
insurance line of business–especially accident insurance. Ever since I
have been a director in an accident-insurance company I have felt that I
am a better man. Life has seemed more precious. Accidents have assumed a
kindlier aspect. Distressing special providences have lost half their
horror. I look upon a cripple now with affectionate interest–as an
advertisement. I do not seem, to care for poetry any more. I do not care
for politics–even agriculture does not excite me. But to me now there is
a charm about a railway collision that is unspeakable.</p>
<p>There is nothing more beneficent than accident insurance. I have seen
an entire family lifted out of poverty and into affluence by the simple
boon of a broken leg. I have had people come to me on crutches, with
tears in their eyes, to bless this beneficent institution. In all my
experience of life, I have seen nothing so seraphic as the look that
comes into a freshly mutilated man’s face when he feels in his vest
pocket with his remaining hand and finds his accident ticket all right.
And I have seen nothing so sad as the look that came into another
splintered customer’s face when he found he couldn’t collect on a wooden
leg.</p>
<p>I will remark here, by way of advertisement, that that noble charity
which we have named the HARTFORD ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANY is an
institution, which is peculiarly to be depended upon. A man is bound to
prosper who gives it his custom. No man pan take out a policy in it and
not get crippled before the year is out. Now there was one indigent man
who had been disappointed so often with other companies that he had
grown disheartened, his appetite left him, he ceased to smile–said life
was but a weariness. Three weeks ago I got him to insure with us, and
now he is the brightest, happiest spirit in this land–has a good steady
income and a stylish suit of new bandages every day, and travels around
on a shutter.</p>
<p>I will say in conclusion, that my share of the welcome to our guest
is none the less hearty because I talk so much nonsense, and I know that
I curl say the same far the rest of the speakers.</p>
<p>OSTEOPATHY</p>
<p>On February 27, 1901, Mr. Clemens appeared before the Assembly
Committee in Albany, New York, in favor of the Seymour bill legalizing
the practice of osteopathy.</p>
<p>MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN,–Dr. Van Fleet is the gentleman who gave
me the character. I have heard my character discussed a thousand times
before you were born, sir, and shown the iniquities in it, and you did
not get more than half of them.</p>
<p>I was touched and distressed when they brought that part of a child
in here, and proved that you cannot take a child to pieces in that way.
What remarkable names those diseases have! It makes me envious of the
man that has them all. I have had many diseases, and am thankful for all
I have had.</p>
<p>One of the gentlemen spoke of the knowledge of something else found
in Sweden, a treatment which I took. It is, I suppose, a kindred thing.
There is apparently no great difference between them. I was a year and a
half in London and Sweden, in the hands of that grand old man,
Mr. Kildren.</p>
<p>I cannot call him a doctor, for he has not the authority to give a
certificate if a patient should die, but fortunately they don’t.</p>
<p>The State stands as a mighty Gibraltar clothed with power. It stands
between me and my body, and tells me what kind of a doctor I must
employ. When my soul is sick unlimited spiritual liberty is given me by
the State. Now then, it doesn’t seem logical that the State shall depart
from this great policy, the health of the soul, and change about and
take the other position in the matter of smaller consequence–the health
of the body.</p>
<p>The Bell bill limitations would drive the osteopaths out of the
State. Oh, dear me! when you drive somebody out of the State you create
the same condition as prevailed in the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>You want the thing that you can’t have. I didn’t care much about the
osteopaths, but as soon as I found they were going to drive them out I
got in a state of uneasiness, and I can’t sleep nights now.</p>
<p>I know how Adam felt in the Garden of Eden about the prohibited
apple. Adam didn’t want the apple till he found out he couldn’t have it,
just as he would have wanted osteopathy if he couldn’t have it.</p>
<p>Whose property is my body? Probably mine. I so regard it. If I
experiment with it, who must be answerable? I, not the State. If I
choose injudiciously, does the State die? Oh no.</p>
<p>I was the subject of my mother’s experiment. She was wise. She made
experiments cautiously. She didn’t pick out just any child in the flock.
No, she chose judiciously. She chose one she could spare, and she
couldn’t spare the others. I was the choice child of the flock; so I had
to take all of the experiments.</p>
<p>In 1844 Kneipp filled the world with the wonder of the water cure.
Mother wanted to try it, but on sober second thought she put me through.
A bucket of ice-water was poured over to see the effect. Then I was
rubbed down with flannels, sheet was dipped in the water, and I was put
to bed. I perspired so much that mother put a life-preserver to bed with
me.</p>
<p>But this had nothing but a spiritual effect on me, and I didn’t care
for that. When they took off the sheet it was yellow from the output of
my conscience, the exudation of sin. It purified me spiritually, and it
remains until this day.</p>
<p>I have experimented with osteopathy and allopathy. I took a chance at
the latter for old times’ sake, for, three tines, when a boy, mother’s
new methods got me so near death’s door she had to call in the family
physician to pull me out.</p>
<p>The physicians think they are moved by regard for the best interests
of the public. Isn’t there a little touch of self-interest back of it
all? It seems to me there is, and I don’t claim to have all the
virtues–only nine or ten of them.</p>
<p>I was born in the “Banner State,“ and by “Banner State“ I mean
Missouri. Osteopathy was born in the same State, and both of us are
getting along reasonably well. At a time during my younger days my
attention was attracted to a picture of a house which bore the
inscription, “Christ Disputing with the Doctors.“</p>
<p>I could attach no other meaning to it than that Christ was actually
quarreling with the doctors. So I asked an old slave, who was a sort of
a herb doctor in a small way–unlicensed, of course–what the meaning of
the picture was. “What had has done?“ I asked. And the colored man
replied “Humph, he ain’t got no license.“</p>
