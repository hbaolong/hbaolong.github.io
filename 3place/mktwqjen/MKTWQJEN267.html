<h4 id="chapter-xvi.">CHAPTER XVI.</h4>
<p>BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil
Saturday afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly’s family, were being put
into mourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet
possessed the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all
conscience. The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air,
and talked little; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a
burden to the children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually
gave them up.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the
deserted schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found
nothing there to comfort her. She soliloquized:</p>
<p>“Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven’t got
anything now to remember him by.“ And she choked back a little sob.</p>
<p>Presently she stopped, and said to herself:</p>
<p>“It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn’t say
that–I wouldn’t say it for the whole world. But he’s gone now; I’ll
never, never, never see him any more.“</p>
<p>This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears
rolling down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls–playmates
of Tom’s and Joe’s–came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and
talking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they
saw him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with
awful prophecy, as they could easily see now!)–and each speaker pointed
out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added
something like “and I was a-standing just so–just as I am now, and as if
you was him–I was as close as that–and he smiled, just this way–and then
something seemed to go all over me, like–awful, you know–and I never
thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!“</p>
<p>Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life,
and many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or
less tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided
who DID see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,
the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance, and
were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had no
other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the
remembrance:</p>
<p>“Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.“</p>
<p>But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say
that, and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered
away, still recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.</p>
<p>When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell
began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still
Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
that lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment
in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there
was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses as
the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None
could remember when the little church had been so full before. There was
finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly
entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in
deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose
reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.
There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled
sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving
hymn was sung, and the text followed: “I am the Resurrection and the
Life.“</p>
<p>As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the
graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that
every soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang in
remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always
before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor
boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the
departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the
people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes
were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation
became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last
the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus
of anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and
crying in the pulpit.</p>
<p>There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment
later the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes
above his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another
pair of eyes followed the minister’s, and then almost with one impulse
the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching
up the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping
rags, sneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused
gallery listening to their own funeral sermon!</p>
<p>Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their
restored ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings,
while poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly
what to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered,
and started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:</p>
<p>“Aunt Polly, it ain’t fair. Somebody’s got to be glad to see
Huck.“</p>
<p>“And so they shall. I’m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!“ And
the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing
capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.</p>
<p>Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: “Praise God
from whom all blessings flow–SING!–and put your hearts in it!“</p>
<p>And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and
while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the
envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the
proudest moment of his life.</p>
<p>As the “sold“ congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that
once more.</p>
<p>Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day–according to Aunt Polly’s
varying moods–than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew
which expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for
himself.</p>
