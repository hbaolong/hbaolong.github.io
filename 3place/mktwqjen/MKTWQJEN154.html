<h4 id="chapter-x.">CHAPTER X.</h4>
<p>Only two or three days had elapsed since the funeral, when something
happened which was to change the drift of Laura’s life somewhat, and
influence in a greater or lesser degree the formation of her
character.</p>
<p>Major Lackland had once been a man of note in the State–a man of
extraordinary natural ability and as extraordinary learning. He had been
universally trusted and honored in his day, but had finally, fallen into
misfortune; while serving his third term in Congress, and while upon the
point of being elevated to the Senate–which was considered the summit of
earthly aggrandizement in those days–he had yielded to temptation, when
in distress for money wherewith to save his estate; and sold his vote.
His crime was discovered, and his fall followed instantly. Nothing could
reinstate him in the confidence of the people, his ruin was
irretrievable–his disgrace complete. All doors were closed against him,
all men avoided him. After years of skulking retirement and dissipation,
death had relieved him of his troubles at last, and his funeral followed
close upon that of Mr. Hawkins. He died as he had latterly lived–wholly
alone and friendless. He had no relatives–or if he had they did not
acknowledge him. The coroner’s jury found certain memoranda upon his
body and about the premises which revealed a fact not suspected by the
villagers before-viz., that Laura was not the child of Mr. and
Mrs. Hawkins.</p>
<p>The gossips were soon at work. They were but little hampered by the
fact that the memoranda referred to betrayed nothing but the bare
circumstance that Laura’s real parents were unknown, and stopped there.
So far from being hampered by this, the gossips seemed to gain all the
more freedom from it. They supplied all the missing information
themselves, they filled up all the blanks. The town soon teemed with
histories of Laura’s origin and secret history, no two versions
precisely alike, but all elaborate, exhaustive, mysterious and
interesting, and all agreeing in one vital particular-to-wit, that there
was a suspicious cloud about her birth, not to say a disreputable
one.</p>
<p>Laura began to encounter cold looks, averted eyes and peculiar nods
and gestures which perplexed her beyond measure; but presently the
pervading gossip found its way to her, and she understood them–then. Her
pride was stung. She was astonished, and at first incredulous. She was
about to ask her mother if there was any truth in these reports, but
upon second thought held her peace. She soon gathered that Major
Lackland’s memoranda seemed to refer to letters which had passed between
himself and Judge Hawkins. She shaped her course without difficulty the
day that that hint reached her.</p>
<p>That night she sat in her room till all was still, and then she stole
into the garret and began a search. She rummaged long among boxes of
musty papers relating to business matters of no, interest to her, but at
last she found several bundles of letters. One bundle was marked
“private,“ and in that she found what she wanted. She selected six or
eight letters from the package and began to devour their contents,
heedless of the cold.</p>
<p>By the dates, these letters were from five to seven years old. They
were all from Major Lackland to Mr. Hawkins. The substance of them was,
that some one in the east had been inquiring of Major Lackland about a
lost child and its parents, and that it was conjectured that the child
might be Laura.</p>
<p>Evidently some of the letters were missing, for the name of the
inquirer was not mentioned; there was a casual reference to “this
handsome-featured aristocratic gentleman,“ as if the reader and the
writer were accustomed to speak of him and knew who was meant.</p>
<p>In one letter the Major said he agreed with Mr. Hawkins that the
inquirer seemed not altogether on the wrong track; but he also agreed
that it would be best to keep quiet until more convincing developments
were forthcoming.</p>
<p>Another letter said that “the poor soul broke completely down when be
saw Laura’s picture, and declared it must be she.“</p>
<p>Still another said:</p>
<p>“He seems entirely alone in the world, and his heart is so wrapped up
in this thing that I believe that if it proved a false hope, it would
kill him; I have persuaded him to wait a little while and go west when I
go.“</p>
<p>Another letter had this paragraph in it:</p>
<p>“He is better one day and worse the next, and is out of his mind a
good deal of the time. Lately his case has developed a something which
is a wonder to the hired nurses, but which will not be much of a marvel
to you if you have read medical philosophy much. It is this: his lost
memory returns to him when he is delirious, and goes away again when he
is himself-just as old Canada Joe used to talk the French patois of his
boyhood in the delirium of typhus fever, though he could not do it when
his mind was clear. Now this poor gentleman’s memory has always broken
down before he reached the explosion of the steamer; he could only
remember starting up the river with his wife and child, and he had an
idea that there was a race, but he was not certain; he could not name
the boat he was on; there was a dead blank of a month or more that
supplied not an item to his recollection. It was not for me to assist
him, of course. But now in his delirium it all comes out: the names of
the boats, every incident of the explosion, and likewise the details of
his astonishing escape–that is, up to where, just as a yawl-boat was
approaching him (he was clinging to the starboard wheel of the burning
wreck at the time), a falling timber struck him on the head. But I will
write out his wonderful escape in full to-morrow or next day. Of course
the physicians will not let me tell him now that our Laura is indeed his
child–that must come later, when his health is thoroughly restored. His
case is not considered dangerous at all; he will recover presently, the
doctors say. But they insist that he must travel a little when he gets
well–they recommend a short sea voyage, and they say he can be persuaded
to try it if we continue to keep him in ignorance and promise to let him
see L. as soon as he returns.“</p>
<p>The letter that bore the latest date of all, contained this
clause:</p>
<p>“It is the most unaccountable thing in the world; the mystery remains
as impenetrable as ever; I have hunted high and low for him, and
inquired of everybody, but in vain; all trace of him ends at that hotel
in New York; I never have seen or heard of him since, up to this day; he
could hardly have sailed, for his name does not appear upon the books of
any shipping office in New York or Boston or Baltimore. How fortunate it
seems, now, that we kept this thing to ourselves; Laura still has a
father in you, and it is better for her that we drop this subject here
forever.“</p>
<p>That was all. Random remarks here and there, being pieced together
gave Laura a vague impression of a man of fine presence, abort
forty-three or forty-five years of age, with dark hair and eyes, and a
slight limp in his walk–it was not stated which leg was defective. And
this indistinct shadow represented her father. She made an exhaustive
search for the missing letters, but found none. They had probably been
burned; and she doubted not that the ones she had ferreted out would
have shared the same fate if Mr. Hawkins had not been a dreamer, void of
method, whose mind was perhaps in a state of conflagration over some
bright new speculation when he received them.</p>
<p>She sat long, with the letters in her lap, thinking–and unconsciously
freezing. She felt like a lost person who has traveled down a long lane
in good hope of escape, and, just as the night descends finds his
progress barred by a bridge-less river whose further shore, if it has
one, is lost in the darkness. If she could only have found these letters
a month sooner! That was her thought. But now the dead had carried their
secrets with them. A dreary, melancholy settled down upon her. An
undefined sense of injury crept into her heart. She grew very
miserable.</p>
<p>She had just reached the romantic age–the age when there is a sad
sweetness, a dismal comfort to a girl to find out that there is a
mystery connected with her birth, which no other piece of good luck can
afford. She had more than her rightful share of practical good sense,
but still she was human; and to be human is to have one’s little modicum
of romance secreted away in one’s composition. One never ceases to make
a hero of one’s self, (in private,) during life, but only alters the
style of his heroism from time to time as the drifting years belittle
certain gods of his admiration and raise up others in their stead that
seem greater.</p>
<p>The recent wearing days and nights of watching, and the wasting grief
that had possessed her, combined with the profound depression that
naturally came with the reaction of idleness, made Laura peculiarly
susceptible at this time to romantic impressions. She was a heroine,
now, with a mysterious father somewhere. She could not really tell
whether she wanted to find him and spoil it all or not; but still all
the traditions of romance pointed to the making the attempt as the usual
and necessary, course to follow; therefore she would some day begin the
search when opportunity should offer.</p>
<p>Now a former thought struck her–she would speak to Mrs. Hawkins. And
naturally enough Mrs. Hawkins appeared on the stage at that moment.</p>
<p>She said she knew all–she knew that Laura had discovered the secret
that Mr. Hawkins, the elder children, Col. Sellers and herself had kept
so long and so faithfully; and she cried and said that now that troubles
had begun they would never end; her daughter’s love would wean itself
away from her and her heart would break. Her grief so wrought upon Laura
that the girl almost forgot her own troubles for the moment in her
compassion for her mother’s distress. Finally Mrs. Hawkins said:</p>
<p>“Speak to me, child–do not forsake me. Forget all this miserable
talk. Say I am your mother!–I have loved you so long, and there is no
other. I am your mother, in the sight of God, and nothing shall ever
take you from me!“</p>
<p>All barriers fell, before this appeal. Laura put her arms about her
mother’s neck and said:</p>
<p>“You are my mother, and always shall be. We will be as we have always
been; and neither this foolish talk nor any other thing shall part us or
make us less to each other than we are this hour.“</p>
<p>There was no longer any sense of separation or estrangement between
them. Indeed their love seemed more perfect now than it had ever been
before. By and by they went down stairs and sat by the fire and talked
long and earnestly about Laura’s history and the letters. But it
transpired that Mrs. Hawkins had never known of this correspondence
between her husband and Major Lackland. With his usual consideration for
his wife, Mr. Hawkins had shielded her from the worry the matter would
have caused her.</p>
<p>Laura went to bed at last with a mind that had gained largely in
tranquility and had lost correspondingly in morbid romantic exaltation.
She was pensive, the next day, and subdued; but that was not matter for
remark, for she did not differ from the mournful friends about her in
that respect. Clay and Washington were the same loving and admiring
brothers now that they had always been. The great secret was new to some
of the younger children, but their love suffered no change under the
wonderful revelation.</p>
<p>It is barely possible that things might have presently settled down
into their old rut and the mystery have lost the bulk of its romantic
sublimity in Laura’s eyes, if the village gossips could have quieted
down. But they could not quiet down and they did not. Day after day they
called at the house, ostensibly upon visits of condolence, and they
pumped away at the mother and the children without seeming to know that
their questionings were in bad taste. They meant no harm they only
wanted to know. Villagers always want to know.</p>
<p>The family fought shy of the questionings, and of course that was
high testimony “if the Duchess was respectably born, why didn’t they
come out and prove it?–why did they, stick to that poor thin story about
picking her up out of a steamboat explosion?“</p>
<p>Under this ceaseless persecution, Laura’s morbid self-communing was
renewed. At night the day’s contribution of detraction, innuendo and
malicious conjecture would be canvassed in her mind, and then she would
drift into a course of thinking. As her thoughts ran on, the indignant
tears would spring to her eyes, and she would spit out fierce little
ejaculations at intervals. But finally she would grow calmer and say
some comforting disdainful thing–something like this:</p>
<p>“But who are they?–Animals! What are their opinions to me? Let them
talk–I will not stoop to be affected by it. I could hate—-.
Nonsense–nobody I care for or in any way respect is changed toward me, I
fancy.“</p>
<p>She may have supposed she was thinking of many individuals, but it
was not so–she was thinking of only one. And her heart warmed somewhat,
too, the while. One day a friend overheard a conversation like this:
–and naturally came and told her all about it:</p>
<p>“Ned, they say you don’t go there any more. How is that?“</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t; but I tell you it’s not because I don’t want to and
it’s not because I think it is any matter who her father was or who he
wasn’t, either; it’s only on account of this talk, talk, talk. I think
she is a fine girl every way, and so would you if you knew her as well
as I do; but you know how it is when a girl once gets talked about–it’s
all up with her–the world won’t ever let her alone, after that.“</p>
<p>The only comment Laura made upon this revelation, was:</p>
<p>“Then it appears that if this trouble had not occurred I could have
had the happiness of Mr. Ned Thurston’s serious attentions. He is well
favored in person, and well liked, too, I believe, and comes of one of
the first families of the village. He is prosperous, too, I hear; has
been a doctor a year, now, and has had two patients–no, three, I think;
yes, it was three. I attended their funerals. Well, other people have
hoped and been disappointed; I am not alone in that. I wish you could
stay to dinner, Maria–we are going to have sausages; and besides, I
wanted to talk to you about Hawkeye and make you promise to come and see
us when we are settled there.“</p>
<p>But Maria could not stay. She had come to mingle romantic tears with
Laura’s over the lover’s defection and had found herself dealing with a
heart that could not rise to an appreciation of affliction because its
interest was all centred in sausages.</p>
<p>But as soon as Maria was gone, Laura stamped her expressive foot and
said:</p>
<p>“The coward! Are all books lies? I thought he would fly to the front,
and be brave and noble, and stand up for me against all the world, and
defy my enemies, and wither these gossips with his scorn! Poor crawling
thing, let him go. I do begin to despise thin world!“</p>
<p>She lapsed into thought. Presently she said:</p>
<p>“If the time ever comes, and I get a chance, Oh, I’ll—-“</p>
<p>She could not find a word that was strong enough, perhaps. By and by
she said:</p>
<p>“Well, I am glad of it–I’m glad of it. I never cared anything for him
anyway!“</p>
<p>And then, with small consistency, she cried a little, and patted her
foot more indignantly than ever.</p>
