<h4 id="is-shakespeare-dead">IS SHAKESPEARE DEAD?</h4>
<p>(from My Autobiography)</p>
<p>Scattered here and there through the stacks of unpublished manuscript
which constitute this formidable Autobiography and Diary of mine,
certain chapters will in some distant future be found which deal with
“Claimants“–claimants historically notorious: Satan, Claimant; the
Golden Calf, Claimant; the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan, Claimant; Louis
XVII., Claimant; William Shakespeare, Claimant; Arthur Orton, Claimant;
Mary Baker G. Eddy, Claimant–and the rest of them. Eminent Claimants,
successful Claimants, defeated Claimants, royal Claimants, pleb
Claimants, showy Claimants, shabby Claimants, revered Claimants,
despised Claimants, twinkle star-like here and there and yonder through
the mists of history and legend and tradition–and, oh, all the darling
tribe are clothed in mystery and romance, and we read about them with
deep interest and discuss them with loving sympathy or with rancorous
resentment, according to which side we hitch ourselves to. It has always
been so with the human race. There was never a Claimant that couldn’t
get a hearing, nor one that couldn’t accumulate a rapturous following,
no matter how flimsy and apparently unauthentic his claim might be.
Arthur Orton’s claim that he was the lost Tichborne baronet come to life
again was as flimsy as Mrs. Eddy’s that she wrote SCIENCE AND HEALTH
from the direct dictation of the Deity; yet in England nearly forty
years ago Orton had a huge army of devotees and incorrigible adherents,
many of whom remained stubbornly unconvinced after their fat god had
been proven an impostor and jailed as a perjurer, and today Mrs. Eddy’s
following is not only immense, but is daily augmenting in numbers and
enthusiasm. Orton had many fine and educated minds among his adherents,
Mrs. Eddy has had the like among hers from the beginning. Her Church is
as well equipped in those particulars as is any other Church. Claimants
can always count upon a following, it doesn’t matter who they are, nor
what they claim, nor whether they come with documents or without. It was
always so. Down out of the long-vanished past, across the abyss of the
ages, if you listen, you can still hear the believing multitudes
shouting for Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel.</p>
<p>A friend has sent me a new book, from England–THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM
RESTATED–well restated and closely reasoned; and my fifty years’
interest in that matter–asleep for the last three years–is excited once
more. It is an interest which was born of Delia Bacon’s book–away back
in the ancient day–1857, or maybe 1856. About a year later my
pilot-master, Bixby, transferred me from his own steamboat to the
PENNSYLVANIA, and placed me under the orders and instructions of George
Ealer–dead now, these many, many years. I steered for him a good many
months–as was the humble duty of the pilot-apprentice: stood a daylight
watch and spun the wheel under the severe superintendence and correction
of the master. He was a prime chess-player and an idolater of
Shakespeare. He would play chess with anybody; even with me, and it cost
his official dignity something to do that. Also–quite uninvited–he would
read Shakespeare to me; not just casually, but by the hour, when it was
his watch and I was steering. He read well, but not profitably for me,
because he constantly injected commands into the text. That broke it all
up, mixed it all up, tangled it all up–to that degree, in fact, that if
we were in a risky and difficult piece of river an ignorant person
couldn’t have told, sometimes, which observations were Shakespeare’s and
which were Ealer’s. For instance:</p>
<p>What man dare, <em>I</em> dare!</p>
<p>Approach thou WHAT are you laying in the leads for? what a hell of an
idea! like the rugged ease her off a little, ease her off! rugged
Russian bear, the armed rhinoceros or the THERE she goes! meet her, meet
her! didn’t you KNOW she’d smell the reef if you crowded in like that?
Hyrcan tiger; take any ship but that and my firm nerves she’ll be in the
WOODS the first you know! stop he starboard! come ahead strong on the
larboard! back the starboard! . . . NOW then, you’re all right; come
ahead on the starboard; straighten up and go ’long, never tremble: or be
alive again, and dare me to the desert DAMNATION can’t you keep away
from that greasy water? pull her down! snatch her! snatch her
baldheaded! with thy sword; if trembling I inhabit then, lay in the
leads!–no, only with the starboard one, leave the other alone, protest
me the baby of a girl. Hence horrible shadow! eight bells–that
watchman’s asleep again, I reckon, go down and call Brown yourself,
unreal mockery, hence!</p>
<p>He certainly was a good reader, and splendidly thrilling and stormy
and tragic, but it was a damage to me, because I have never since been
able to read Shakespeare in a calm and sane way. I cannot rid it of his
explosive interlardings, they break in everywhere with their irrelevant,
“What in hell are you up to NOW! pull her down! more! MORE!–there now,
steady as you go,“ and the other disorganizing interruptions that were
always leaping from his mouth. When I read Shakespeare now I can hear
them as plainly as I did in that long-departed time–fifty-one years ago.
I never regarded Ealer’s readings as educational. Indeed, they were a
detriment to me.</p>
<p>His contributions to the text seldom improved it, but barring that
detail he was a good reader; I can say that much for him. He did not use
the book, and did not need to; he knew his Shakespeare as well as Euclid
ever knew his multiplication table.</p>
<p>Did he have something to say–this Shakespeare-adoring Mississippi
pilot–anent Delia Bacon’s book?</p>
<p>Yes. And he said it; said it all the time, for months–in the morning
watch, the middle watch, and dog watch; and probably kept it going in
his sleep. He bought the literature of the dispute as fast as it
appeared, and we discussed it all through thirteen hundred miles of
river four times traversed in every thirty-five days–the time required
by that swift boat to achieve two round trips. We discussed, and
discussed, and discussed, and disputed and disputed and disputed; at any
rate, HE did, and I got in a word now and then when he slipped a cog and
there was a vacancy. He did his arguing with heat, with energy, with
violence; and I did mine with the reverse and moderation of a
subordinate who does not like to be flung out of a pilot-house and is
perched forty feet above the water. He was fiercely loyal to Shakespeare
and cordially scornful of Bacon and of all the pretensions of the
Baconians. So was I–at first. And at first he was glad that that was my
attitude. There were even indications that he admired it; indications
dimmed, it is true, by the distance that lay between the lofty
boss-pilotical altitude and my lowly one, yet perceptible to me;
perceptible, and translatable into a compliment–compliment coming down
from about the snow-line and not well thawed in the transit, and not
likely to set anything afire, not even a cub-pilot’s self-conceit; still
a detectable complement, and precious.</p>
<p>Naturally it flattered me into being more loyal to Shakespeare–if
possible–than I was before, and more prejudiced against Bacon–if
possible–that I was before. And so we discussed and discussed, both on
the same side, and were happy. For a while. Only for a while. Only for a
very little while, a very, very, very little while. Then the atmosphere
began to change; began to cool off.</p>
<p>A brighter person would have seen what the trouble was, earlier than
I did, perhaps, but I saw it early enough for all practical purposes.
You see, he was of an argumentative disposition. Therefore it took him
but a little time to get tired of arguing with a person who agreed with
everything he said and consequently never furnished him a provocative to
flare up and show what he could do when it came to clear, cold, hard,
rose-cut, hundred-faceted, diamond-flashing REASONING. That was his name
for it. It has been applied since, with complacency, as many as several
times, in the Bacon-Shakespeare scuffle. On the Shakespeare side.</p>
<p>Then the thing happened which has happened to more persons than to me
when principle and personal interest found themselves in opposition to
each other and a choice had to be made: I let principle go, and went
over to the other side. Not the entire way, but far enough to answer the
requirements of the case. That is to say, I took this attitude–to wit, I
only BELIEVED Bacon wrote Shakespeare, whereas I KNEW Shakespeare
didn’t. Ealer was satisfied with that, and the war broke loose. Study,
practice, experience in handling my end of the matter presently enabled
me to take my new position almost seriously; a little bit later, utterly
seriously; a little later still, lovingly, gratefully, devotedly;
finally: fiercely, rabidly, uncompromisingly. After that I was welded to
my faith, I was theoretically ready to die for it, and I looked down
with compassion not unmixed with scorn upon everybody else’s faith that
didn’t tally with mine. That faith, imposed upon me by self-interest in
that ancient day, remains my faith today, and in it I find comfort,
solace, peace, and never-failing joy. You see how curiously theological
it is. The “rice Christian“ of the Orient goes through the very same
steps, when he is after rice and the missionary is after HIM; he goes
for rice, and remains to worship.</p>
<p>Ealer did a lot of our “reasoning“–not to say substantially all of
it. The slaves of his cult have a passion for calling it by that large
name. We others do not call our inductions and deductions and reductions
by any name at all. They show for themselves what they are, and we can
with tranquil confidence leave the world to ennoble them with a title of
its own choosing.</p>
<p>Now and then when Ealer had to stop to cough, I pulled my
induction-talents together and hove the controversial lead myself:
always getting eight feet, eight and a half, often nine, sometimes even
quarter-less-twain–as <em>I</em> believed; but always “no bottom,“ as HE
said.</p>
<p>I got the best of him only once. I prepared myself. I wrote out a
passage from Shakespeare–it may have been the very one I quoted awhile
ago, I don’t remember–and riddled it with his wild steamboatful
interlardings. When an unrisky opportunity offered, one lovely summer
day, when we had sounded and buoyed a tangled patch of crossings known
as Hell’s Half Acre, and were aboard again and he had sneaked the
PENNSYLVANIA triumphantly through it without once scraping sand, and the
A. T. LACEY had followed in our wake and got stuck, and he was feeling
good, I showed it to him. It amused him. I asked him to fire it off
–READ it; read it, I diplomatically added, as only HE could read
dramatic poetry. The compliment touched him where he lived. He did read
it; read it with surpassing fire and spirit; read it as it will never be
read again; for HE know how to put the right music into those thunderous
interlardings and make them seem a part of the text, make them sound as
if they were bursting from Shakespeare’s own soul, each one of them a
golden inspiration and not to be left out without damage to the massed
and magnificent whole.</p>
<p>I waited a week, to let the incident fade; waited longer; waited
until he brought up for reasonings and vituperation my pet position, my
pet argument, the one which I was fondest of, the one which I prized far
above all others in my ammunition-wagon–to wit, that Shakespeare
couldn’t have written Shakespeare’s words, for the reason that the man
who wrote them was limitlessly familiar with the laws, and the
law-courts, and law-proceedings, and lawyer-talk, and lawyer-ways–and if
Shakespeare was possessed of the infinitely divided star-dust that
constituted this vast wealth, HOW did he get it, and WHERE and WHEN?</p>
<p>“From books.“</p>
<p>From books! That was always the idea. I answered as my readings of
the champions of my side of the great controversy had taught me to
answer: that a man can’t handle glibly and easily and comfortably and
successfully the argot of a trade at which he has not personally served.
He will make mistakes; he will not, and cannot, get the trade-phrasings
precisely and exactly right; and the moment he departs, by even a shade,
from a common trade-form, the reader who has served that trade will know
the writer HASN’T. Ealer would not be convinced; he said a man could
learn how to correctly handle the subtleties and mysteries and
free-masonries of ANY trade by careful reading and studying. But when I
got him to read again the passage from Shakespeare with the
interlardings, he perceived, himself, that books couldn’t teach a
student a bewildering multitude of pilot-phrases so thoroughly and
perfectly that he could talk them off in book and play or conversation
and make no mistake that a pilot would not immediately discover. It was
a triumph for me. He was silent awhile, and I knew what was happening–he
was losing his temper. And I knew he would presently close the session
with the same old argument that was always his stay and his support in
time of need; the same old argument, the one I couldn’t answer, because
I dasn’t–the argument that I was an ass, and better shut up. He
delivered it, and I obeyed.</p>
<p>O dear, how long ago it was–how pathetically long ago! And here am I,
old, forsaken, forlorn, and alone, arranging to get that argument out of
somebody again.</p>
<p>When a man has a passion for Shakespeare, it goes without saying that
he keeps company with other standard authors. Ealer always had several
high-class books in the pilot-house, and he read the same ones over and
over again, and did not care to change to newer and fresher ones. He
played well on the flute, and greatly enjoyed hearing himself play. So
did I. He had a notion that a flute would keep its health better if you
took it apart when it was not standing a watch; and so, when it was not
on duty it took its rest, disjointed, on the compass-shelf under the
breastboard. When the PENNSYLVANIA blew up and became a drifting
rack-heap freighted with wounded and dying poor souls (my young brother
Henry among them), pilot Brown had the watch below, and was probably
asleep and never knew what killed him; but Ealer escaped unhurt. He and
his pilot-house were shot up into the air; then they fell, and Ealer
sank through the ragged cavern where the hurricane-deck and the
boiler-deck had been, and landed in a nest of ruins on the main deck, on
top of one of the unexploded boilers, where he lay prone in a fog of
scald and deadly steam. But not for long. He did not lose his head–long
familiarity with danger had taught him to keep it, in any and all
emergencies. He held his coat-lapels to his nose with one hand, to keep
out the steam, and scrabbled around with the other till he found the
joints of his flute, then he took measures to save himself alive, and
was successful. I was not on board. I had been put ashore in New Orleans
by Captain Klinenfelter. The reason–however, I have told all about it in
the book called OLD TIMES ON THE MISSISSIPPI, and it isn’t important,
anyway, it is so long ago.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>When I was a Sunday-school scholar, something more than sixty years
ago, I became interested in Satan, and wanted to find out all I could
about him. I began to ask questions, but my class-teacher, Mr. Barclay,
the stone-mason, was reluctant about answering them, it seemed to me. I
was anxious to be praised for turning my thoughts to serious subjects
when there wasn’t another boy in the village who could be hired to do
such a thing. I was greatly interested in the incident of Eve and the
serpent, and thought Eve’s calmness was perfectly noble. I asked
Mr. Barclay if he had ever heard of another woman who, being approached
by a serpeant, would not excuse herself and break for the nearest
timber. He did not answer my question, but rebuked me for inquiring into
matters above my age and comprehension. I will say for Mr. Barclay that
he was willing to tell me the facts of Satan’s history, but he stopped
there: he wouldn’t allow any discussion of them.</p>
<p>In the course of time we exhausted the facts. There were only five or
six of them; you could set them all down on a visiting-card. I was
disappointed. I had been meditating a biography, and was grieved to find
that there were no materials. I said as much, with the tears running
down. Mr. Barclay’s sympathy and compassion were aroused, for he was a
most kind and gentle-spirited man, and he patted me on the head and
cheered me up by saying there was a whole vast ocean of materials! I can
still feel the happy thrill which these blessed words shot through
me.</p>
<p>Then he began to bail out that ocean’s riches for my encouragement
and joy. Like this: it was “conjectured“–though not established–that
Satan was originally an angel in Heaven; that he fell; that he rebelled,
and brought on a war; that he was defeated, and banished to perdition.
Also, “we have reason to believe“ that later he did so and so; that “we
are warranted in supposing“ that at a subsequent time he traveled
extensively, seeking whom he might devour; that a couple of centuries
afterward, “as tradition instructs us,“ he took up the cruel trade of
tempting people to their ruin, with vast and fearful results; that by
and by, “as the probabilities seem to indicate,“ he may have done
certain things, he might have done certain other things, he must have
done still other things.</p>
<p>And so on and so on. We set down the five known facts by themselves
on a piece of paper, and numbered it “page 1“; then on fifteen hundred
other pieces of paper we set down the “conjectures,“ and “suppositions,“
and “maybes,“ and “perhapses,“ and “doubtlesses,“ and “rumors,“ and
“guesses,“ and “probabilities,“ and “likelihoods,“ and “we are permitted
to thinks,“ and “we are warranted in believings,“ and “might have
beens,“ and “could have beens,“ and “must have beens,“ and
“unquestionablys,“ and “without a shadow of doubt“–and behold!</p>
<p>MATERIALS? Why, we had enough to build a biography of
Shakespeare!</p>
<p>Yet he made me put away my pen; he would not let me write the history
of Satan. Why? Because, as he said, he had suspicions–suspicions that my
attitude in the matter was not reverent, and that a person must be
reverent when writing about the sacred characters. He said any one who
spoke flippantly of Satan would be frowned upon by the religious world
and also be brought to account.</p>
<p>I assured him, in earnest and sincere words, that he had wholly
misconceived my attitude; that I had the highest respect for Satan, and
that my reverence for him equaled, and possibly even exceeded, that of
any member of the church. I said it wounded me deeply to perceive by his
words that he thought I would make fun of Satan, and deride him, laugh
at him, scoff at him; whereas in truth I had never thought of such a
thing, but had only a warm desire to make fun of those others and laugh
at THEM. “What others?“ “Why, the Supposers, the Perhapsers, the
Might-Have-Beeners, the Could-Have-Beeners, the Must-Have-Beeners, the
Without-a-Shadow-of-Doubters, the We-Are-Warranted-in-Believingers, and
all that funny crop of solemn architects who have taken a good solid
foundation of five indisputable and unimportant facts and built upon it
a Conjectural Satan thirty miles high.“</p>
<p>What did Mr. Barclay do then? Was he disarmed? Was he silenced?
No. He was shocked. He was so shocked that he visibly shuddered. He said
the Satanic Traditioners and Perhapsers and Conjecturers were THEMSELVES
sacred! As sacred as their work. So sacred that whoso ventured to mock
them or make fun of their work, could not afterward enter any
respectable house, even by the back door.</p>
<p>How true were his words, and how wise! How fortunate it would have
been for me if I had heeded them. But I was young, I was but seven years
of age, and vain, foolish, and anxious to attract attention. I wrote the
biography, and have never been in a respectable house since.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>How curious and interesting is the parallel–as far as poverty of
biographical details is concerned–between Satan and Shakespeare. It is
wonderful, it is unique, it stands quite alone, there is nothing
resembling it in history, nothing resembling it in romance, nothing
approaching it even in tradition. How sublime is their position, and how
over-topping, how sky-reaching, how supreme–the two Great Unknowns, the
two Illustrious Conjecturabilities! They are the best-known unknown
persons that have ever drawn breath upon the planet.</p>
<p>For the instruction of the ignorant I will make a list, now, of those
details of Shakespeare’s history which are FACTS–verified facts,
established facts, undisputed facts.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>He was born on the 23d of April, 1564.</p>
<p>Of good farmer-class parents who could not read, could not write,
could not sign their names.</p>
<p>At Stratford, a small back settlement which in that day was shabby
and unclean, and densely illiterate. Of the nineteen important men
charged with the government of the town, thirteen had to “make their
mark“ in attesting important documents, because they could not write
their names.</p>
<p>Of the first eighteen years of his life NOTHING is known. They are a
blank.</p>
<p>On the 27th of November (1582) William Shakespeare took out a license
to marry Anne Whateley.</p>
<p>Next day William Shakespeare took out a license to marry Anne
Hathaway. She was eight years his senior.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway. In a hurry. By grace of a
reluctantly granted dispensation there was but one publication of the
banns.</p>
<p>Within six months the first child was born.</p>
<p>About two (blank) years followed, during which period NOTHING AT ALL
HAPPENED TO SHAKESPEARE, so far as anybody knows.</p>
<p>Then came twins–1585. February.</p>
<p>Two blank years follow.</p>
<p>Then–1587–he makes a ten-year visit to London, leaving the family
behind.</p>
<p>Five blank years follow. During this period NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM,
as far as anybody actually knows.</p>
<p>Then–1592–there is mention of him as an actor.</p>
<p>Next year–1593–his name appears in the official list of players.</p>
<p>Next year–1594–he played before the queen. A detail of no
consequence: other obscurities did it every year of the forty-five of
her reign. And remained obscure.</p>
<p>Three pretty full years follow. Full of play-acting. Then</p>
<p>In 1597 he bought New Place, Stratford.</p>
<p>Thirteen or fourteen busy years follow; years in which he accumulated
money, and also reputation as actor and manager.</p>
<p>Meantime his name, liberally and variously spelt, had become
associated with a number of great plays and poems, as (ostensibly)
author of the same.</p>
<p>Some of these, in these years and later, were pirated, but he made no
protest.</p>
<p>Then–1610-11–he returned to Stratford and settled down for good and
all, and busied himself in lending money, trading in tithes, trading in
land and houses; shirking a debt of forty-one shillings, borrowed by his
wife during his long desertion of his family; suing debtors for
shillings and coppers; being sued himself for shillings and coppers; and
acting as confederate to a neighbor who tried to rob the town of its
rights in a certain common, and did not succeed.</p>
<p>He lived five or six years–till 1616–in the joy of these elevated
pursuits. Then he made a will, and signed each of its three pages with
his name.</p>
<p>A thoroughgoing business man’s will. It named in minute detail every
item of property he owned in the world–houses, lands, sword, silver-gilt
bowl, and so on–all the way down to his “second-best bed“ and its
furniture.</p>
<p>It carefully and calculatingly distributed his riches among the
members of his family, overlooking no individual of it. Not even his
wife: the wife he had been enabled to marry in a hurry by urgent grace
of a special dispensation before he was nineteen; the wife whom he had
left husbandless so many years; the wife who had had to borrow forty-one
shillings in her need, and which the lender was never able to collect of
the prosperous husband, but died at last with the money still lacking.
No, even this wife was remembered in Shakespeare’s will.</p>
<p>He left her that “second-best bed.“</p>
<p>And NOT ANOTHER THING; not even a penny to bless her lucky widowhood
with.</p>
<p>It was eminently and conspicuously a business man’s will, not a
poet’s.</p>
<p>It mentioned NOT A SINGLE BOOK.</p>
<p>Books were much more precious than swords and silver-gilt bowls and
second-best beds in those days, and when a departing person owned one he
gave it a high place in his will.</p>
<p>The will mentioned NOT A PLAY, NOT A POEM, NOT AN UNFINISHED LITERARY
WORK, NOT A SCRAP OF MANUSCRIPT OF ANY KIND.</p>
<p>Many poets have died poor, but this is the only one in history that
has died THIS poor; the others all left literary remains behind. Also a
book. Maybe two.</p>
<p>If Shakespeare had owned a dog–but we not go into that: we know he
would have mentioned it in his will. If a good dog, Susanna would have
got it; if an inferior one his wife would have got a downer interest in
it. I wish he had had a dog, just so we could see how painstakingly he
would have divided that dog among the family, in his careful business
way.</p>
<p>He signed the will in three places.</p>
<p>In earlier years he signed two other official documents.</p>
<p>These five signatures still exist.</p>
<p>There are NO OTHER SPECIMENS OF HIS PENMANSHIP IN EXISTENCE. Not a
line.</p>
<p>Was he prejudiced against the art? His granddaughter, whom he loved,
was eight years old when he died, yet she had had no teaching, he left
no provision for her education, although he was rich, and in her mature
womanhood she couldn’t write and couldn’t tell her husband’s manuscript
from anybody else’s–she thought it was Shakespeare’s.</p>
<p>When Shakespeare died in Stratford, IT WAS NOT AN EVENT. It made no
more stir in England than the death of any other forgotten theater-actor
would have made. Nobody came down from London; there were no lamenting
poems, no eulogies, no national tears–there was merely silence, and
nothing more. A striking contrast with what happened when Ben Jonson,
and Francis Bacon, and Spenser, and Raleigh, and the other distinguished
literary folk of Shakespeare’s time passed from life! No praiseful voice
was lifted for the lost Bard of Avon; even Ben Jonson waited seven years
before he lifted his.</p>
<p>SO FAR AS ANYBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS AND CAN PROVE, Shakespeare of
Stratford-on-Avon never wrote a play in his life.</p>
<p>SO FAR AS ANY ONE KNOWS, HE RECEIVED ONLY ONE LETTER DURING HIS
LIFE.</p>
<p>So far as any one KNOWS AND CAN PROVE, Shakespeare of Stratford wrote
only one poem during his life. This one is authentic. He did write that
one–a fact which stands undisputed; he wrote the whole of it; he wrote
the whole of it out of his own head. He commanded that this work of art
be engraved upon his tomb, and he was obeyed. There it abides to this
day. This is it:</p>
<p>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare:
Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my
bones.</p>
<p>In the list as above set down will be found EVERY POSITIVELY KNOWN
fact of Shakespeare’s life, lean and meager as the invoice is. Beyond
these details we know NOT A THING about him. All the rest of his vast
history, as furnished by the biographers, is built up, course upon
course, of guesses, inferences, theories, conjectures–an Eiffel Tower of
artificialities rising sky-high from a very flat and very thin
foundation of inconsequential facts.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Conjectures</p>
<p>The historians “suppose“ that Shakespeare attended the Free School in
Stratford from the time he was seven years old till he was thirteen.
There is no EVIDENCE in existence that he ever went to school at
all.</p>
<p>The historians “infer“ that he got his Latin in that school–the
school which they “suppose“ he attended.</p>
<p>They “suppose“ his father’s declining fortunes made it necessary for
him to leave the school they supposed he attended, and get to work and
help support his parents and their ten children. But there is no
evidence that he ever entered or returned from the school they suppose
he attended.</p>
<p>They “suppose“ he assisted his father in the butchering business; and
that, being only a boy, he didn’t have to do full-grown butchering, but
only slaughtering calves. Also, that whenever he killed a calf he made a
high-flown speech over it. This supposition rests upon the testimony of
a man who wasn’t there at the time; a man who got it from a man who
could have been there, but did not say whether he was nor not; and
neither of them thought to mention it for decades, and decades, and
decades, and two more decades after Shakespeare’s death (until old age
and mental decay had refreshed and vivified their memories). They hadn’t
two facts in stock about the long-dead distinguished citizen, but only
just the one: he slaughtered calves and broke into oratory while he was
at it. Curious. They had only one fact, yet the distinguished citizen
had spent twenty-six years in that little town–just half his lifetime.
However, rightly viewed, it was the most important fact, indeed almost
the only important fact, of Shakespeare’s life in Stratford. Rightly
viewed. For experience is an author’s most valuable asset; experience is
the thing that puts the muscle and the breath and the warm blood into
the book he writes. Rightly viewed, calf-butchering accounts for “Titus
Andronicus,“ the only play–ain’t it?–that the Stratford Shakespeare ever
wrote; and yet it is the only one everybody tried to chouse him out of,
the Baconians included.</p>
<p>The historians find themselves “justified in believing“ that the
young Shakespeare poached upon Sir Thomas Lucy’s deer preserves and got
haled before that magistrate for it. But there is no shred of
respectworthy evidence that anything of the kind happened.</p>
<p>The historians, having argued the thing that MIGHT have happened into
the thing that DID happen, found no trouble in turning Sir Thomas Lucy
into Mr. Justice Shallow. They have long ago convinced the world–on
surmise and without trustworthy evidence–that Shallow IS Sir Thomas.</p>
<p>The next addition to the young Shakespeare’s Stratford history comes
easy. The historian builds it out of the surmised deer-steeling, and the
surmised trial before the magistrate, and the surmised
vengeance-prompted satire upon the magistrate in the play: result, the
young Shakespeare was a wild, wild, wild, oh, SUCH a wild young scamp,
and that gratuitous slander is established for all time! It is the very
way Professor Osborn and I built the colossal skeleton brontosaur that
stands fifty-seven feet long and sixteen feet high in the Natural
History Museum, the awe and admiration of all the world, the stateliest
skeleton that exists on the planet. We had nine bones, and we built the
rest of him out of plaster of Paris. We ran short of plaster of Paris,
or we’d have built a brontosaur that could sit down beside the Stratford
Shakespeare and none but an expert could tell which was biggest or
contained the most plaster.</p>
<p>Shakespeare pronounced “Venus and Adonis“ “the first heir of his
invention,“ apparently implying that it was his first effort at literary
composition. He should not have said it. It has been an embarrassment to
his historians these many, many years. They have to make him write that
graceful and polished and flawless and beautiful poem before he escaped
from Stratford and his family–1586 or ’87–age, twenty-two, or along
there; because within the next five years he wrote five great plays, and
could not have found time to write another line.</p>
<p>It is sorely embarrassing. If he began to slaughter calves, and poach
deer, and rollick around, and learn English, at the earliest likely
moment–say at thirteen, when he was supposably wretched from that school
where he was supposably storing up Latin for future literary use–he had
his youthful hands full, and much more than full. He must have had to
put aside his Warwickshire dialect, which wouldn’t be understood in
London, and study English very hard. Very hard indeed; incredibly hard,
almost, if the result of that labor was to be the smooth and rounded and
flexible and letter-perfect English of the “Venus and Adonis“ in the
space of ten years; and at the same time learn great and fine and
unsurpassable literary FORM.</p>
<p>However, it is “conjectured“ that he accomplished all this and more,
much more: learned law and its intricacies; and the complex procedure of
the law-courts; and all about soldiering, and sailoring, and the manners
and customs and ways of royal courts and aristocratic society; and
likewise accumulated in his one head every kind of knowledge the learned
then possessed, and every kind of humble knowledge possessed by the
lowly and the ignorant; and added thereto a wider and more intimate
knowledge of the world’s great literatures, ancient and modern, than was
possessed by any other man of his time–for he was going to make
brilliant and easy and admiration-compelling use of these splendid
treasures the moment he got to London. And according to the surmisers,
that is what he did. Yes, although there was no one in Stratford able to
teach him these things, and no library in the little village to dig them
out of. His father could not read, and even the surmisers surmise that
he did not keep a library.</p>
<p>It is surmised by the biographers that the young Shakespeare got his
vast knowledge of the law and his familiar and accurate acquaintance
with the manners and customs and shop-talk of lawyers through being for
a time the CLERK OF A STRATFORD COURT; just as a bright lad like me,
reared in a village on the banks of the Mississippi, might become
perfect in knowledge of the Bering Strait whale-fishery and the
shop-talk of the veteran exercises of that adventure-bristling trade
through catching catfish with a “trot-line“ Sundays. But the surmise is
damaged by the fact that there is no evidence–and not even
tradition–that the young Shakespeare was ever clerk of a law-court.</p>
<p>It is further surmised that the young Shakespeare accumulated his
law-treasures in the first years of his sojourn in London, through
“amusing himself“ by learning book-law in his garret and by picking up
lawyer-talk and the rest of it through loitering about the law-courts
and listening. But it is only surmise; there is no EVIDENCE that he ever
did either of those things. They are merely a couple of chunks of
plaster of Paris.</p>
<p>There is a legend that he got his bread and butter by holding horses
in front of the London theaters, mornings and afternoons. Maybe he did.
If he did, it seriously shortened his law-study hours and his
recreation-time in the courts. In those very days he was writing great
plays, and needed all the time he could get. The horse-holding legend
ought to be strangled; it too formidably increases the historian’s
difficulty in accounting for the young Shakespeare’s erudition–an
erudition which he was acquiring, hunk by hunk and chunk by chunk, every
day in those strenuous times, and emptying each day’s catch into next
day’s imperishable drama.</p>
<p>He had to acquire a knowledge of war at the same time; and a
knowledge of soldier-people and sailor-people and their ways and talk;
also a knowledge of some foreign lands and their languages: for he was
daily emptying fluent streams of these various knowledges, too, into his
dramas. How did he acquire these rich assets?</p>
<p>In the usual way: by surmise. It is SURMISED that he traveled in
Italy and Germany and around, and qualified himself to put their scenic
and social aspects upon paper; that he perfected himself in French,
Italian, and Spanish on the road; that he went in Leicester’s expedition
to the Low Countries, as soldier or sutler or something, for several
months or years–or whatever length of time a surmiser needs in his
business–and thus became familiar with soldiership and soldier-ways and
soldier-talk and generalship and general-ways and general-talk, and
seamanship and sailor-ways and sailor-talk.</p>
<p>Maybe he did all these things, but I would like to know who held the
horses in the mean time; and who studied the books in the garret; and
who frolicked in the law-courts for recreation. Also, who did the
call-boying and the play-acting.</p>
<p>For he became a call-boy; and as early as ’93 he became a
“vagabond“–the law’s ungentle term for an unlisted actor; and in ’94 a
“regular“ and properly and officially listed member of that (in those
days) lightly valued and not much respected profession.</p>
<p>Right soon thereafter he became a stockholder in two theaters, and
manager of them. Thenceforward he was a busy and flourishing business
man, and was raking in money with both hands for twenty years. Then in a
noble frenzy of poetic inspiration he wrote his one poem–his only poem,
his darling–and laid him down and died:</p>
<p>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare:
Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my
bones.</p>
<p>He was probably dead when he wrote it. Still, this is only
conjecture. We have only circumstantial evidence. Internal evidence.</p>
<p>Shall I set down the rest of the Conjectures which constitute the
giant Biography of William Shakespeare? It would strain the Unabridged
Dictionary to hold them. He is a brontosaur: nine bones and six hundred
barrels of plaster of Paris.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>“We May Assume“</p>
<p>In the Assuming trade three separate and independent cults are
transacting business. Two of these cults are known as the Shakespearites
and the Baconians, and I am the other one–the Brontosaurian.</p>
<p>The Shakespearite knows that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare’s Works;
the Baconian knows that Francis Bacon wrote them; the Brontosaurian
doesn’t really know which of them did it, but is quite composedly and
contentedly sure that Shakespeare DIDN’T, and strongly suspects that
Bacon DID. We all have to do a good deal of assuming, but I am fairly
certain that in every case I can call to mind the Baconian assumers have
come out ahead of the Shakespearites. Both parties handle the same
materials, but the Baconians seem to me to get much more reasonable and
rational and persuasive results out of them than is the case with the
Shakespearites. The Shakespearite conducts his assuming upon a definite
principle, an unchanging and immutable law: which is: 2 and 8 and 7 and
14, added together, make 165. I believe this to be an error. No matter,
you cannot get a habit-sodden Shakespearite to cipher-up his materials
upon any other basis. With the Baconian it is different. If you place
before him the above figures and set him to adding them up, he will
never in any case get more than 45 out of them, and in nine cases out of
ten he will get just the proper 31.</p>
<p>Let me try to illustrate the two systems in a simple and homely way
calculated to bring the idea within the grasp of the ignorant and
unintelligent. We will suppose a case: take a lap-bred, house-fed,
uneducated, inexperienced kitten; take a rugged old Tom that’s scarred
from stem to rudder-post with the memorials of strenuous experience, and
is so cultured, so educated, so limitlessly erudite that one may say of
him “all cat-knowledge is his province“; also, take a mouse. Lock the
three up in a holeless, crackless, exitless prison-cell. Wait half an
hour, then open the cell, introduce a Shakespearite and a Baconian, and
let them cipher and assume. The mouse is missing: the question to be
decided is, where is it? You can guess both verdicts beforehand. One
verdict will say the kitten contains the mouse; the other will as
certainly say the mouse is in the tom-cat.</p>
<p>The Shakespearite will Reason like this–(that is not my word, it is
his). He will say the kitten MAY HAVE BEEN attending school when nobody
was noticing; therefore WE ARE WARRANTED IN ASSUMING that it did so;
also, it COULD HAVE BEEN training in a court-clerk’s office when no one
was noticing; since that could have happened, WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN
ASSUMING that it did happen; it COULD HAVE STUDIED CATOLOGY IN A GARRET
when no one was noticing–therefore it DID; it COULD HAVE attended
cat-assizes on the shed-roof nights, for recreation, when no one was
noticing, and have harvested a knowledge of cat court-forms and cat
lawyer-talk in that way: it COULD have done it, therefore without a
doubt it DID; it COULD HAVE gone soldiering with a war-tribe when no one
was noticing, and learned soldier-wiles and soldier-ways, and what to do
with a mouse when opportunity offers; the plain inference, therefore, is
that that is what it DID. Since all these manifold things COULD have
occurred, we have EVERY RIGHT TO BELIEVE they did occur. These patiently
and painstakingly accumulated vast acquirements and competences needed
but one thing more–opportunity–to convert themselves into triumphal
action. The opportunity came, we have the result; BEYOND SHADOW OF
QUESTION the mouse is in the kitten.</p>
<p>It is proper to remark that when we of the three cults plant a “WE
THINK WE MAY ASSUME,“ we expect it, under careful watering and
fertilizing and tending, to grow up into a strong and hardy and
weather-defying “THERE ISN’T A SHADOW OF A DOUBT“ at last–and it usually
happens.</p>
<p>We know what the Baconian’s verdict would be: “THERE IS NOT A RAG OF
EVIDENCE THAT THE KITTEN HAS HAD ANY TRAINING, ANY EDUCATION, ANY
EXPERIENCE QUALIFYING IT FOR THE PRESENT OCCASION, OR IS INDEED EQUIPPED
FOR ANY ACHIEVEMENT ABOVE LIFTING SUCH UNCLAIMED MILK AS COMES ITS WAY;
BUT THERE IS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE–UNASSAILABLE PROOF, IN FACT–THAT THE
OTHER ANIMAL IS EQUIPPED, TO THE LAST DETAIL, WITH EVERY QUALIFICATION
NECESSARY FOR THE EVENT. WITHOUT SHADOW OF DOUBT THE TOM-CAT CONTAINS
THE MOUSE.“</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>When Shakespeare died, in 1616, great literary productions attributed
to him as author had been before the London world and in high favor for
twenty-four years. Yet his death was not an event. It made no stir, it
attracted no attention. Apparently his eminent literary contemporaries
did not realize that a celebrated poet had passed from their midst.
Perhaps they knew a play-actor of minor rank had disappeared, but did
not regard him as the author of his Works. “We are justified in
assuming“ this.</p>
<p>His death was not even an event in the little town of Stratford. Does
this mean that in Stratford he was not regarded as a celebrity of ANY
kind?</p>
<p>“We are privileged to assume“–no, we are indeed OBLIGED to
assume–that such was the case. He had spent the first twenty-two or
twenty-three years of his life there, and of course knew everybody and
was known by everybody of that day in the town, including the dogs and
the cats and the horses. He had spent the last five or six years of his
life there, diligently trading in every big and little thing that had
money in it; so we are compelled to assume that many of the folk there
in those said latter days knew him personally, and the rest by sight and
hearsay. But not as a CELEBRITY? Apparently not. For everybody soon
forgot to remember any contact with him or any incident connected with
him. The dozens of townspeople, still alive, who had known of him or
known about him in the first twenty-three years of his life were in the
same unremembering condition: if they knew of any incident connected
with that period of his life they didn’t tell about it. Would the if
they had been asked? It is most likely. Were they asked? It is pretty
apparent that they were not. Why weren’t they? It is a very plausible
guess that nobody there or elsewhere was interested to know.</p>
<p>For seven years after Shakespeare’s death nobody seems to have been
interested in him. Then the quarto was published, and Ben Jonson awoke
out of his long indifference and sang a song of praise and put it in the
front of the book. Then silence fell AGAIN.</p>
<p>For sixty years. Then inquiries into Shakespeare’s Stratford life
began to be made, of Stratfordians. Of Stratfordians who had known
Shakespeare or had seen him? No. Then of Stratfordians who had seen
people who had known or seen people who had seen Shakespeare?
No. Apparently the inquires were only made of Stratfordians who were not
Stratfordians of Shakespeare’s day, but later comers; and what they had
learned had come to them from persons who had not seen Shakespeare; and
what they had learned was not claimed as FACT, but only as legend–dim
and fading and indefinite legend; legend of the calf-slaughtering rank,
and not worth remembering either as history or fiction.</p>
<p>Has it ever happened before–or since–that a celebrated person who had
spent exactly half of a fairly long life in the village where he was
born and reared, was able to slip out of this world and leave that
village voiceless and gossipless behind him–utterly voiceless., utterly
gossipless? And permanently so? I don’t believe it has happened in any
case except Shakespeare’s. And couldn’t and wouldn’t have happened in
his case if he had been regarded as a celebrity at the time of his
death.</p>
<p>When I examine my own case–but let us do that, and see if it will not
be recognizable as exhibiting a condition of things quite likely to
result, most likely to result, indeed substantially SURE to result in
the case of a celebrated person, a benefactor of the human race. Like
me.</p>
<p>My parents brought me to the village of Hannibal, Missouri, on the
banks of the Mississippi, when I was two and a half years old. I entered
school at five years of age, and drifted from one school to another in
the village during nine and a half years. Then my father died, leaving
his family in exceedingly straitened circumstances; wherefore my
book-education came to a standstill forever, and I became a printer’s
apprentice, on board and clothes, and when the clothes failed I got a
hymn-book in place of them. This for summer wear, probably. I lived in
Hannibal fifteen and a half years, altogether, then ran away, according
to the custom of persons who are intending to become celebrated. I never
lived there afterward. Four years later I became a “cub“ on a
Mississippi steamboat in the St. Louis and New Orleans trade, and after
a year and a half of hard study and hard work the U.S. inspectors
rigorously examined me through a couple of long sittings and decided
that I knew every inch of the Mississippi–thirteen hundred miles–in the
dark and in the day–as well as a baby knows the way to its mother’s paps
day or night. So they licensed me as a pilot–knighted me, so to
speak–and I rose up clothed with authority, a responsible servant of the
United States Government.</p>
<p>Now then. Shakespeare died young–he was only fifty-two. He had lived
in his native village twenty-six years, or about that. He died
celebrated (if you believe everything you read in the books). Yet when
he died nobody there or elsewhere took any notice of it; and for sixty
years afterward no townsman remembered to say anything about him or
about his life in Stratford. When the inquirer came at last he got but
one fact –no, LEGEND–and got that one at second hand, from a person who
had only heard it as a rumor and didn’t claim copyright in it as a
production of his own. He couldn’t, very well, for its date antedated
his own birth-date. But necessarily a number of persons were still alive
in Stratford who, in the days of their youth, had seen Shakespeare
nearly every day in the last five years of his life, and they would have
been able to tell that inquirer some first-hand things about him if he
had in those last days been a celebrity and therefore a person of
interest to the villagers. Why did not the inquirer hunt them up and
interview them? Wasn’t it worth while? Wasn’t the matter of sufficient
consequence? Had the inquirer an engagement to see a dog-fight and
couldn’t spare the time?</p>
<p>It all seems to mean that he never had any literary celebrity, there
or elsewhere, and no considerable repute as actor and manager.</p>
<p>Now then, I am away along in life–my seventy-third year being already
well behind me–yet SIXTEEN of my Hannibal schoolmates are still alive
today, and can tell–and do tell–inquirers dozens and dozens of incidents
of their young lives and mine together; things that happened to us in
the morning of life, in the blossom of our youth, in the good days, the
dear days, “the days when we went gipsying, a long time ago.“ Most of
them creditable to me, too. One child to whom I paid court when she was
five years old and I eight still lives in Hannibal, and she visited me
last summer, traversing the necessary ten or twelve hundred miles of
railroad without damage to her patience or to her old-young vigor.
Another little lassie to whom I paid attention in Hannibal when she was
nine years old and I the same, is still alive–in London–and hale and
hearty, just as I am. And on the few surviving steamboats–those
lingering ghosts and remembrancers of great fleets that plied the big
river in the beginning of my water-career–which is exactly as long ago
as the whole invoice of the life-years of Shakespeare numbers–there are
still findable two or three river-pilots who saw me do creditable things
in those ancient days; and several white-headed engineers; and several
roustabouts and mates; and several deck-hands who used to heave the lead
for me and send up on the still night the “Six–feet–SCANT!“ that made me
shudder, and the “M-a-r-k–TWAIN!“ that took the shudder away, and
presently the darling “By the d-e-e-p–FOUR!“ that lifted me to heaven
for joy. [1] They know about me, and can tell. And so do printers, from
St. Louis to New York; and so do newspaper reporters, from Nevada to San
Francisco. And so do the police. If Shakespeare had really been
celebrated, like me, Stratford could have told things about him; and if
my experience goes for anything, they’d have done it.</p>
<p>—— 1. Four fathoms–twenty-four feet.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>If I had under my superintendence a controversy appointed to decide
whether Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare or not, I believe I would place
before the debaters only the one question, WAS SHAKESPEARE EVER A
PRACTICING LAWYER? and leave everything else out.</p>
<p>It is maintained that the man who wrote the plays was not merely
myriad-minded, but also myriad-accomplished: that he not only knew some
thousands of things about human life in all its shades and grades, and
about the hundred arts and trades and crafts and professions which men
busy themselves in, but that he could TALK about the men and their
grades and trades accurately, making no mistakes. Maybe it is so, but
have the experts spoken, or is it only Tom, Dick, and Harry? Does the
exhibit stand upon wide, and loose, and eloquent generalizing–which is
not evidence, and not proof–or upon details, particulars, statistics,
illustrations, demonstrations?</p>
<p>Experts of unchallengeable authority have testified definitely as to
only one of Shakespeare’s multifarious craft-equipments, so far as my
recollections of Shakespeare-Bacon talk abide with me–his law-equipment.
I do not remember that Wellington or Napoleon ever examined
Shakespeare’s battles and sieges and strategies, and then decided and
established for good and all that they were militarily flawless; I do
not remember that any Nelson, or Drake, or Cook ever examined his
seamanship and said it showed profound and accurate familiarity with
that art; I don’t remember that any king or prince or duke has ever
testified that Shakespeare was letter-perfect in his handling of royal
court-manners and the talk and manners of aristocracies; I don’t
remember that any illustrious Latinist or Grecian or Frenchman or
Spaniard or Italian has proclaimed him a past-master in those languages;
I don’t remember–well, I don’t remember that there is TESTIMONY–great
testimony–imposing testimony–unanswerable and unattackable testimony as
to any of Shakespeare’s hundred specialties, except one–the law.</p>
<p>Other things change, with time, and the student cannot trace back
with certainty the changes that various trades and their processes and
technicalities have undergone in the long stretch of a century or two
and find out what their processes and technicalities were in those early
days, but with the law it is different: it is mile-stoned and documented
all the way back, and the master of that wonderful trade, that complex
and intricate trade, that awe-compelling trade, has competent ways of
knowing whether Shakespeare-law is good law or not; and whether his
law-court procedure is correct or not, and whether his legal shop-talk
is the shop-talk of a veteran practitioner or only a machine-made
counterfeit of it gathered from books and from occasional loiterings in
Westminster.</p>
<p>Richard H. Dana served two years before the mast, and had every
experience that falls to the lot of the sailor before the mast of our
day. His sailor-talk flows from his pen with the sure touch and the ease
and confidence of a person who has LIVED what he is talking about, not
gathered it from books and random listenings. Hear him:</p>
<p>Having hove short, cast off the gaskets, and made the bunt of each
sail fast by the jigger, with a man on each yard, at the word the whole
canvas of the ship was loosed, and with the greatest rapidity possible
everything was sheeted home and hoisted up, the anchor tripped and
cat-headed, and the ship under headway.</p>
<p>Again:</p>
<p>The royal yards were all crossed at once, and royals and sky-sails
set, and, as we had the wind free, the booms were run out, and all were
aloft, active as cats, laying out on the yards and booms, reeving the
studding-sail gear; and sail after sail the captain piled upon her,
until she was covered with canvas, her sails looking like a great white
cloud resting upon a black speck.</p>
<p>Once more. A race in the Pacific:</p>
<p>Our antagonist was in her best trim. Being clear of the point, the
breeze became stiff, and the royal-masts bent under our sails, but we
would not take them in until we saw three boys spring into the rigging
of the CALIFORNIA; then they were all furled at once, but with orders to
our boys to stay aloft at the top-gallant mast-heads and loose them
again at the word. It was my duty to furl the fore-royal; and while
standing by to loose it again, I had a fine view of the scene. From
where I stood, the two vessels seemed nothing but spars and sails, while
their narrow decks, far below, slanting over by the force of the wind
aloft, appeared hardly capable of supporting the great fabrics raised
upon them. The CALIFORNIA was to windward of us, and had every
advantage; yet, while the breeze was stiff we held our own. As soon as
it began to slacken she ranged a little ahead, and the order was given
to loose the royals. In an instant the gaskets were off and the bunt
dropped. “Sheet home the fore-royal!“–“Weather sheet’s home!“–“Lee
sheet’s home!“–“Hoist away, sir!“ is bawled from aloft. “Overhaul your
clew-lines!“ shouts the mate. “Aye-aye, sir, all clear!“–“Taut leech!
belay! Well the lee brace; haul taut to windward!“ and the royals are
set.</p>
<p>What would the captain of any sailing-vessel of our time say to that?
He would say, “The man that wrote that didn’t learn his trade out of a
book, he has BEEN there!“ But would this same captain be competent to
sit in judgment upon Shakespeare’s seamanship–considering the changes in
ships and ship-talk that have necessarily taken place, unrecorded,
unremembered, and lost to history in the last three hundred years? It is
my conviction that Shakespeare’s sailor-talk would be Choctaw to him.
For instance–from “The Tempest“:</p>
<p>MASTER. Boatswain!</p>
<p>BOATSWAIN. Here, master; what cheer?</p>
<p>MASTER. Good, speak to the mariners: fall to ’t, yarely, or we run
ourselves to ground; bestir, bestir! (ENTER MARINERS.)</p>
<p>BOATSWAIN. Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare!
Take in the topsail. Tend to the master’s whistle. . . . Down with the
topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try wi’ the main course. . . .
Lay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses. Off to sea again; lay her
off.</p>
<p>That will do, for the present; let us yare a little, now, for a
change.</p>
<p>If a man should write a book and in it make one of his characters
say, “Here, devil, empty the quoins into the standing galley and the
imposing-stone into the hell-box; assemble the comps around the frisket
and let them jeff for takes and be quick about it,“ I should recognize a
mistake or two in the phrasing, and would know that the writer was only
a printer theoretically, not practically.</p>
<p>I have been a quartz miner in the silver regions–a pretty hard life;
I know all the palaver of that business: I know all about discovery
claims and the subordinate claims; I know all about lodes, ledges,
outcroppings, dips, spurs, angles, shafts, drifts, inclines, levels,
tunnels, air-shafts, “horses,“ clay casings, granite casings; quartz
mills and their batteries; arastras, and how to charge them with
quicksilver and sulphate of copper; and how to clean them up, and how to
reduce the resulting amalgam in the retorts, and how to cast the bullion
into pigs; and finally I know how to screen tailings, and also how to
hunt for something less robust to do, and find it. I know the argot and
the quartz-mining and milling industry familiarly; and so whenever Bret
Harte introduces that industry into a story, the first time one of his
miners opens his mouth I recognize from his phrasing that Harte got the
phrasing by listening–like Shakespeare–I mean the Stratford one–not by
experience. No one can talk the quartz dialect correctly without
learning it with pick and shovel and drill and fuse.</p>
<p>I have been a surface miner–gold–and I know all its mysteries, and
the dialects that belongs with them; and whenever Harte introduces that
industry into a story I know by the phrasing of his characters that
neither he nor they have ever served that trade.</p>
<p>I have been a “pocket“ miner–a sort of gold mining not findable in
any but one little spot in the world, so far as I know. I know how, with
horn and water, to find the trail of a pocket and trace it step by step
and stage by stage up the mountain to its source, and find the compact
little nest of yellow metal reposing in its secret home under the
ground. I know the language of that trade, that capricious trade, that
fascinating buried-treasure trade, and can catch any writer who tries to
use it without having learned it by the sweat of his brow and the labor
of his hands.</p>
<p>I know several other trades and the argot that goes with them; and
whenever a person tries to talk the talk peculiar to any of them without
having learned it at its source I can trap him always before he gets far
on his road.</p>
<p>And so, as I have already remarked, if I were required to superintend
a Bacon-Shakespeare controversy, I would narrow the matter down to a
single question–the only one, so far as the previous controversies have
informed me, concerning which illustrious experts of unimpeachable
competency have testified: WAS THE AUTHOR OF SHAKESPEARE’S WORKS A
LAWYER?–a lawyer deeply read and of limitless experience? I would put
aside the guesses and surmises, and perhapes, and might-have-beens, and
could-have-beens, and must-have-beens, and we-are-justified-in-
presumings,and the rest of those vague specters and shadows and
indefintenesses, and stand or fall, win or lose, by the verdict rendered
by the jury upon that single question. If the verdict was Yes, I should
feel quite convinced that the Stratford Shakespeare, the actor, manager,
and trader who died so obscure, so forgotten, so destitute of even
village consequence, that sixty years afterward no fellow-citizen and
friend of his later days remembered to tell anything about him, did not
write the Works.</p>
