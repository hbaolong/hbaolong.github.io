1884, TO HOWELLS AND OTHERS. CABLE’S GREAT APRIL FOOL. “HUCK FINN“ IN
PRESS. MARK TWAIN FOR CLEVELAND. CLEMENS AND CABLE</h4>
<p>Mark Twain had a lingering attack of the dramatic fever that winter.
He made a play of the Prince and Pauper, which Howells pronounced “too
thin and slight and not half long enough.“ He made another of Tom
Sawyer, and probably destroyed it, for no trace of the MS. exists
to-day. Howells could not join in these ventures, for he was otherwise
occupied and had sickness in his household.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>Jan. 7, ’84. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–“O my goodn’s“, as Jean says. You have
now encountered at last the heaviest calamity that can befall an author.
The scarlet fever, once domesticated, is a permanent member of the
family. Money may desert you, friends forsake you, enemies grow
indifferent to you, but the scarlet fever will be true to you, through
thick and thin, till you be all saved or damned, down to the last one. I
say these things to cheer you.</p>
<p>The bare suggestion of scarlet fever in the family makes me shudder;
I believe I would almost rather have Osgood publish a book for me.</p>
<p>You folks have our most sincere sympathy. Oh, the intrusion of this
hideous disease is an unspeakable disaster.</p>
<p>My billiard table is stacked up with books relating to the Sandwich
Islands: the walls axe upholstered with scraps of paper penciled with
notes drawn from them. I have saturated myself with knowledge of that
unimaginably beautiful land and that most strange and fascinating
people. And I have begun a story. Its hidden motive will illustrate a
but-little considered fact in human nature; that the religious folly you
are born in you will die in, no matter what apparently reasonabler
religious folly may seem to have taken its place meanwhile, and
abolished and obliterated it. I start Bill Ragsdale at 12 years of age,
and the heroine at 4, in the midst of the ancient idolatrous system,
with its picturesque and amazing customs and superstitions, 3 months
before the arrival of the missionaries and the erection of a shallow
Christianity upon the ruins of the old paganism. Then these two will
become educated Christians, and highly civilized.</p>
<p>And then I will jump 15 years, and do Ragsdale’s leper business. When
we came to dramatize, we can draw a deal of matter from the story, all
ready to our hand. Yrs Ever MARK.</p>
<p>He never finished the Sandwich Islands story which he and Howells
were to dramatize later. His head filled up with other projects, such as
publishing plans, reading-tours, and the like. The type-setting machine
does not appear in the letters of this period, but it was an important
factor, nevertheless. It was costing several thousand dollars a month
for construction and becoming a heavy drain on Mark Twain’s finances. It
was necessary to recuperate, and the anxiety for a profitable play, or
some other adventure that would bring a quick and generous return, grew
out of this need.</p>
<p>Clemens had established Charles L. Webster, his nephew by marriage,
in a New York office, as selling agent for the Mississippi book and for
his plays. He was also planning to let Webster publish the new book,
Huck Finn.</p>
<p>George W. Cable had proven his ability as a reader, and Clemens saw
possibilities in a reading combination, which was first planned to
include Aldrich, and Howells, and a private car.</p>
<p>But Aldrich and Howells did not warm to the idea, and the car was
eliminated from the plan. Cable came to visit Clemens in Hartford, and
was taken with the mumps, so that the reading-trip was postponed.</p>
<p>The fortunes of the Sellers play were most uncertain and becoming
daily more doubtful. In February, Howells wrote: “If you have got any
comfort in regard to our play I wish you would heave it into my
bosom.“</p>
<p>Cable recovered in time, and out of gratitude planned a great
April-fool surprise for his host. He was a systematic man, and did it in
his usual thorough way. He sent a “private and confidential“ suggestion
to a hundred and fifty of Mark Twain’s friends and admirers, nearly all
distinguished literary men. The suggestion was that each one of them
should send a request for Mark Twain’s autograph, timing it so that it
would arrive on the 1st of April. All seemed to have responded. Mark
Twain’s writing-table on April Fool morning was heaped with letters,
asking in every ridiculous fashion for his “valuable autograph.“ The one
from Aldrich was a fair sample. He wrote: “I am making a collection of
autographs of our distinguished writers, and having read one of your
works, Gabriel Convoy, I would like to add your name to the list.“</p>
<p>Of course, the joke in this was that Gabriel Convoy was by Bret
Harte, who by this time was thoroughly detested by Mark Twain. The first
one or two of the letters puzzled the victim; then he comprehended the
size and character of the joke and entered into it thoroughly. One of
the letters was from Bloodgood H. Cutter, the “Poet Lariat“ of Innocents
Abroad. Cutter, of course, wrote in “poetry,“ that is to say, doggerel.
Mark Twain’s April Fool was a most pleasant one.</p>
<p>Rhymed letter by Bloodgood H. Cutter to Mark Twain:</p>
<p>LITTLE NECK, LONG ISLAND.</p>
<p>LONG ISLAND FARMER, TO HIS FRIEND AND PILGRIM BROTHER, SAMUEL L.
CLEMENS, ESQ.</p>
<p>Friends, suggest in each one’s behalf To write, and ask your
autograph. To refuse that, I will not do, After the long voyage had with
you. That was a memorable time You wrote in prose, I wrote in Rhyme To
describe the wonders of each place, And the queer customs of each
race.</p>
<p>That is in my memory yet For while I live I’ll not forget. I often
think of that affair And the many that were with us there.</p>
<p>As your friends think it for the best I ask your Autograph with the
rest, Hoping you will it to me send ’Twill please and cheer your dear
old friend:</p>
<p>Yours truly, BLOODGOOD H. CUTTER.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Apl 8, ’84. MY DEAR HOWELLS, It took my breath away, and I
haven’t recovered it yet, entirely–I mean the generosity of your
proposal to read the proofs of Huck Finn.</p>
<p>Now if you mean it, old man–if you are in earnest–proceed, in God’s
name, and be by me forever blest. I cannot conceive of a rational man
deliberately piling such an atrocious job upon himself; but if there is
such a man and you be that man, why then pile it on. It will cost me a
pang every time I think of it, but this anguish will be eingebusst to me
in the joy and comfort I shall get out of the not having to read the
verfluchtete proofs myself. But if you have repented of your
augenblichlicher Tobsucht and got back to calm cold reason again, I
won’t hold you to it unless I find I have got you down in writing
somewhere. Herr, I would not read the proof of one of my books for any
fair and reasonable sum whatever, if I could get out of it.</p>
<p>The proof-reading on the P andandandand P cost me the last rags of my
religion. M.</p>
<p>Howells had written that he would be glad to help out in the reading
of the proofs of Huck Finn, which book Webster by this time had in hand.
Replying to Clemens’s eager and grateful acceptance now, he wrote: “It
is all perfectly true about the generosity, unless I am going to read
your proofs from one of the shabby motives which I always find at the
bottom of my soul if I examine it.“ A characteristic utterance, though
we may be permitted to believe that his shabby motives were fewer and
less shabby than those of mankind in general.</p>
<p>The proofs which Howells was reading pleased him mightily. Once,
during the summer, he wrote: “if I had written half as good a book as
Huck Finn I shouldn’t ask anything better than to read the proofs; even
as it is, I don’t, so send them on; they will always find me
somewhere.“</p>
<p>This was the summer of the Blaine-Cleveland campaign. Mark Twain, in
company with many other leading men, had mugwumped, and was supporting
Cleveland. From the next letter we gather something of the aspects of
that memorable campaign, which was one of scandal and vituperation. We
learn, too, that the young sculptor, Karl Gerhardt, having completed a
three years’ study in Paris, had returned to America a qualified
artist.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Aug. 21, ’84. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–This presidential campaign is
too delicious for anything. Isn’t human nature the most consummate sham
and lie that was ever invented? Isn’t man a creature to be ashamed of in
pretty much all his aspects? Man, “know thyself “–and then thou wilt
despise thyself, to a dead moral certainty. Take three quite good
specimens–Hawley, Warner, and Charley Clark. Even I do not loathe Blaine
more than they do; yet Hawley is howling for Blaine, Warner and Clark
are eating their daily crow in the paper for him, and all three will
vote for him. O Stultification, where is thy sting, O slave where is thy
hickory!</p>
<p>I suppose you heard how a marble monument for which St. Gaudens was
pecuniarily responsible, burned down in Hartford the other day,
uninsured–for who in the world would ever think of insuring a marble
shaft in a cemetery against a fire?–and left St. Gauden out of pocket
5,000.</p>
<p>It was a bad day for artists. Gerhardt finished my bust that day, and
the work was pronounced admirable by all the kin and friends; but in
putting it in plaster (or rather taking it out) next day it got ruined.
It was four or five weeks hard work gone to the dogs. The news flew, and
everybody on the farm flocked to the arbor and grouped themselves about
the wreck in a profound and moving silence–the farm-help, the colored
servants, the German nurse, the children, everybody–a silence
interrupted at wide intervals by absent-minded ejaculations wising from
unconscious breasts as the whole size of the disaster gradually worked
its way home to the realization of one spirit after another.</p>
<p>Some burst out with one thing, some another; the German nurse put up
her hands and said, “Oh, Schade! oh, schrecklich! “But Gerhardt said
nothing; or almost that. He couldn’t word it, I suppose. But he went to
work, and by dark had everything thoroughly well under way for a fresh
start in the morning; and in three days’ time had built a new bust which
was a trifle better than the old one–and to-morrow we shall put the
finishing touches on it, and it will be about as good a one as nearly
anybody can make. Yrs Ever MARK.</p>
<p>If you run across anybody who wants a bust, be sure and recommend
Gerhardt on my say-so.</p>
<p>But Howells was determinedly for Blaine. “I shall vote for Blaine,“
he replied. “I do not believe he is guilty of the things they accuse him
of, and I know they are not proved against him. As for Cleveland, his
private life may be no worse than that of most men, but as an enemy of
that contemptible, hypocritical, lop-sided morality which says a woman
shall suffer all the shame of unchastity and man none, I want to see him
destroyed politically by his past. The men who defend him would take
their wives to the White House if he were president, but if he married
his concubine–‘made her an honest woman’ they would not go near him. I
can’t stand that.“</p>
<p>Certainly this was sound logic, in that day, at least. But it left
Clemens far from satisfied.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Sept. 17, ’84. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Somehow I can’t seem to rest
quiet under the idea of your voting for Blaine. I believe you said
something about the country and the party. Certainly allegiance to these
is well; but as certainly a man’s first duty is to his own conscience
and honor–the party or the country come second to that, and never first.
I don’t ask you to vote at all–I only urge you to not soil yourself by
voting for Blaine.</p>
<p>When you wrote before, you were able to say the charges against him
were not proven. But you know now that they are proven, and it seems to
me that that bars you and all other honest and honorable men (who are
independently situated) from voting for him.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to vote for Cleveland; the only necessary thing
to do, as I understand it, is that a man shall keep himself clean, (by
withholding his vote for an improper man) even though the party and the
country go to destruction in consequence. It is not parties that make or
save countries or that build them to greatness–it is clean men, clean
ordinary citizens, rank and file, the masses. Clean masses are not made
by individuals standing back till the rest become clean.</p>
<p>As I said before, I think a man’s first duty is to his own honor; not
to his country and not to his party. Don’t be offended; I mean no
offence. I am not so concerned about the rest of the nation, but–well,
good-bye. Ys Ever MARK.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any further discussion of the matter
between Howells and Clemens. Their letters for a time contained no
suggestion of politics.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mark Twain’s own political conscience was not entirely clear
in his repudiation of his party; at least we may believe from his next
letter that his Cleveland enthusiasm was qualified by a willingness to
support a Republican who would command his admiration and honor. The
idea of an eleventh-hour nomination was rather startling, whatever its
motive.</p>
<p>To Mr. Pierce, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Oct. 22, ’84. MY DEAR MR. PIERCE,–You know, as well as I
do, that the reason the majority of republicans are going to vote for
Blaine is because they feel that they cannot help themselves. Do not you
believe that if Mr. Edmunds would consent to run for President, on the
Independent ticket–even at this late day–he might be elected?</p>
<p>Well, if he wouldn’t consent, but should even strenuously protest and
say he wouldn’t serve if elected, isn’t it still wise and fair to
nominate him and vote for him? since his protest would relieve him from
all responsibility; and he couldn’t surely find fault with people for
forcing a compliment upon him. And do not you believe that his name thus
compulsorily placed at the head of the Independent column would work
absolutely certain defeat to Blain and save the country’s honor?</p>
<p>Politicians often carry a victory by springing some disgraceful and
rascally mine under the feet of the adversary at the eleventh hour;
would it not be wholesome to vary this thing for once and spring as
formidable a mine of a better sort under the enemy’s works?</p>
<p>If Edmunds’s name were put up, I would vote for him in the teeth of
all the protesting and blaspheming he could do in a month; and there are
lots of others who would do likewise.</p>
<p>If this notion is not a foolish and wicked one, won’t you just
consult with some chief Independents, and see if they won’t call a
sudden convention and whoop the thing through? To nominate Edmunds the
1st of November, would be soon enough, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>With kindest regards to you and the Aldriches, Yr Truly S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Clemens and Cable set out on their reading-tour in November. They
were a curiously-assorted pair: Cable was of orthodox religion, exact as
to habits, neat, prim, all that Clemens was not. In the beginning Cable
undertook to read the Bible aloud to Clemens each evening, but this part
of the day’s program was presently omitted by request. If they spent
Sunday in a town, Cable was up bright and early visiting the various
churches and Sunday-schools, while Mark Twain remained at the hotel, in
bed, reading or asleep.</p>
<p>XXV</p>
<p>THE GREAT YEAR OF 1885. CLEMENS AND CABLE. PUBLICATION OF “HUCK
FINN.“ THE GRANT MEMOIRS. MARK TWAIN AT FIFTY</p>
<p>The year 1885 was in some respects the most important, certainly the
most pleasantly exciting, in Mark Twain’s life. It was the year in which
he entered fully into the publishing business and launched one of the
most spectacular of all publishing adventures, The Personal Memoirs of
General U. S. Grant. Clemens had not intended to do general publishing
when he arranged with Webster to become sales-agent for the Mississippi
book, and later general agent for Huck Finn’s adventures; he had
intended only to handle his own books, because he was pretty thoroughly
dissatisfied with other publishing arrangements. Even the Library of
Humor, which Howells, with Clark, of the Courant, had put together for
him, he left with Osgood until that publisher failed, during the spring
of 1885. Certainly he never dreamed of undertaking anything of the
proportions of the Grant book.</p>
<p>He had always believed that Grant could make a book. More than once,
when they had met, he had urged the General to prepare his memoirs for
publication. Howells, in his ‘My Mark Twain’, tells of going with
Clemens to see Grant, then a member of the ill-fated firm of Grant and
Ward, and how they lunched on beans, bacon and coffee brought in from a
near-by restaurant. It was while they were eating this soldier fare that
Clemens–very likely abetted by Howells –especially urged the great
commander to prepare his memoirs. But Grant had become a financier, as
he believed, and the prospect of literary earnings, however large, did
not appeal to him. Furthermore, he was convinced that he was without
literary ability and that a book by him would prove a failure.</p>
<p>But then, by and by, came a failure more disastrous than anything he
had foreseen–the downfall of his firm through the Napoleonic rascality
of Ward. General Grant was utterly ruined; he was left without income
and apparently without the means of earning one. It was the period when
the great War Series was appeasing in the Century Magazine. General
Grant, hard-pressed, was induced by the editors to prepare one or more
articles, and, finding that he could write them, became interested in
the idea of a book. It is unnecessary to repeat here the story of how
the publication of this important work passed into the hands of Mark
Twain; that is to say, the firm of Charles L. Webster andandandand Co.,
the details having been fully given elsewhere.–[See Mark Twain: A
Biography, chap. cliv.]–</p>
<p>We will now return for the moment to other matters, as reported in
order by the letters. Clemens and Cable had continued their reading-tour
into Canada, and in February found themselves in Montreal. Here they
were invited by the Toque Bleue Snow-shoe Club to join in one of their
weekly excursions across Mt. Royal. They could not go, and the reasons
given by Mark Twain are not without interest. The letter is to
Mr. George Iles, author of Flame, Electricity, and the Camera, and many
other useful works.</p>
<p>To George Iles, far the Toque Blew Snow-shoe Club, Montreal:</p>
<p>DETROIT, February 12, 1885. Midnight, P.S. MY DEAR ILES,–I got your
other telegram a while ago, and answered it, explaining that I get only
a couple of hours in the middle of the day for social life. I know it
doesn’t seem rational that a man should have to lie abed all day in
order to be rested and equipped for talking an hour at night, and yet in
my case and Cable’s it is so. Unless I get a great deal of rest, a
ghastly dulness settles down upon me on the platform, and turns my
performance into work, and hard work, whereas it ought always to be
pastime, recreation, solid enjoyment. Usually it is just this latter,
but that is because I take my rest faithfully, and prepare myself to do
my duty by my audience.</p>
<p>I am the obliged and appreciative servant of my brethren of the
Snow-shoe Club, and nothing in the world would delight me more than to
come to their house without naming time or terms on my own part–but you
see how it is. My cast iron duty is to my audience–it leaves me no
liberty and no option.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to the Club, and to you, I am Sincerely yours S.
L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>In the next letter we reach the end of the Clemens-Cable venture and
get a characteristic summing up of Mark Twain’s general attitude toward
the companion of his travels. It must be read only in the clear
realization of Mark Twain’s attitude toward orthodoxy, and his habit of
humor. Cable was as rigidly orthodox as Mark Twain was revolutionary.
The two were never anything but the best of friends.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>PHILADA. Feb. 27, ’85. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–To-night in Baltimore,
to-morrow afternoon and night in Washington, and my four-months platform
campaign is ended at last. It has been a curious experience. It has
taught me that Cable’s gifts of mind are greater and higher than I had
suspected. But–</p>
<p>That “But“ is pointing toward his religion. You will never, never
know, never divine, guess, imagine, how loathsome a thing the Christian
religion can be made until you come to know and study Cable daily and
hourly. Mind you, I like him; he is pleasant company; I rage and swear
at him sometimes, but we do not quarrel; we get along mighty happily
together; but in him and his person I have learned to hate all
religions. He has taught me to abhor and detest the Sabbath-day and hunt
up new and troublesome ways to dishonor it.</p>
<p>Nat Goodwin was on the train yesterday. He plays in Washington all
the coming week. He is very anxious to get our Sellers play and play it
under changed names. I said the only thing I could do would be to write
to you. Well, I’ve done it. Ys Ever MARK.</p>
<p>Clemens and Webster were often at the house of General Grant during
these early days of 1885, and it must have been Webster who was present
with Clemens on the great occasion described in the following telegram.
It was on the last day and hour of President Arthur’s administration
that the bill was passed which placed Ulysses S. Grant as full General
with full pay on the retired list, and it is said that the congressional
clock was set back in order that this enactment might become a law
before the administration changed. General Grant had by this time
developed cancer and was already in feeble health.</p>
<p>Telegram to Mrs. Clemens, in Hartford:</p>
<p>NEW YORK, Mar. 4, 1885. To MRS. S. L. CLEMENS, We were at General
Grant’s at noon and a telegram arrived that the last act of the expiring
congress late this morning retired him with full General’s rank and
accompanying emoluments. The effect upon him was like raising the dead.
We were present when the telegram was put in his hand.</p>
<p>S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Something has been mentioned before of Mark Twain’s investments and
the generally unprofitable habit of them. He had a trusting nature, and
was usually willing to invest money on any plausible recommendation. He
was one of thousands such, and being a person of distinction he now and
then received letters of inquiry, complaint, or condolence. A minister
wrote him that he had bought some stocks recommended by a Hartford
banker and advertised in a religious paper. He added, “After I made that
purchase they wrote me that you had just bought a hundred shares and
that you were a ‘shrewd’ man.“ The writer closed by asking for further
information. He received it, as follows:</p>
<p>To the Rev. J—-, in Baltimore:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Mch. 2,’85. MY DEAR SIR,–I take my earliest opportunity
to answer your favor of Feb.</p>
<p>B—- was premature in calling me a “shrewd man.“ I wasn’t one at that
time, but am one now–that is, I am at least too shrewd to ever again
invest in anything put on the market by B—-. I know nothing whatever
about the Bank Note Co., and never did know anything about it. B—- sold
me about ,000 or ,000 worth of the stock at 10, and I own it yet. He
sold me 0,000 worth of another rose-tinted stock about the same time. I
have got that yet, also. I judge that a peculiarity of B—-’s stocks is
that they are of the staying kind. I think you should have asked
somebody else whether I was a shrewd man or not for two reasons: the
stock was advertised in a religious paper, a circumstance which was very
suspicious; and the compliment came to you from a man who was interested
to make a purchaser of you. I am afraid you deserve your loss. A
financial scheme advertised in any religious paper is a thing which any
living person ought to know enough to avoid; and when the factor is
added that M. runs that religious paper, a dead person ought to know
enough to avoid it. Very Truly Yours S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The story of Huck Finn was having a wide success. Webster handled it
skillfully, and the sales were large. In almost every quarter its
welcome was enthusiastic. Here and there, however, could be found an
exception; Huck’s morals were not always approved of by library
reading-committees. The first instance of this kind was reported from
Concord; and would seem not to have depressed the author-publisher.</p>
<p>To Chas. L. Webster, in New York:</p>
<p>Mch 18, ’85. DEAR CHARLEY,–The Committee of the Public Library of
Concord, Mass, have given us a rattling tip-top puff which will go into
every paper in the country. They have expelled Huck from their library
as “trash and suitable only for the slums.“ That will sell 25,000 copies
for us sure.</p>
<p>S. L. C.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Concord Free Trade Club had some idea of making amends to
Mark Twain for the slight put upon his book by their librarians, for
immediately after the Huck Finn incident they notified him of his
election to honorary membership.</p>
<p>Those were the days of “authors’ readings,“ and Clemens and Howells
not infrequently assisted at these functions, usually given as benefits
of one kind or another. From the next letter, written following an
entertainment given for the Longfellow memorial, we gather that Mark
Twain’s opinion of Howells’s reading was steadily improving.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, May 5, ’85. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–…..Who taught you to read?
Observation and thought, I guess. And practice at the Tavern Club?–yes;
and that was the best teaching of all:</p>
<p>Well, you sent even your daintiest and most delicate and fleeting
points home to that audience–absolute proof of good reading. But you
couldn’t read worth a damn a few years ago. I do not say this to
flatter. It is true I looked around for you when I was leaving, but you
had already gone.</p>
<p>Alas, Osgood has failed at last. It was easy to see that he was on
the very verge of it a year ago, and it was also easy to see that he was
still on the verge of it a month or two ago; but I continued to hope–but
not expect that he would pull through. The Library of Humor is at his
dwelling house, and he will hand it to you whenever you want it.</p>
<p>To save it from any possibility of getting mixed up in the failure,
perhaps you had better send down and get it. I told him, the other day,
that an order of any kind from you would be his sufficient warrant for
its delivery to you.</p>
<p>In two days General Grant has dictated 50 pages of foolscap, and thus
the Wilderness and Appomattox stand for all time in his own words. This
makes the second volume of his book as valuable as the first.</p>
<p>He looks mighty well, these latter days. Yrs Ever MARK.</p>
<p>“I am exceedingly glad,“ wrote Howells, “that you approve of my
reading, for it gives me some hope that I may do something on the
platform next winter….. but I would never read within a hundred miles of
you, if I could help it. You simply straddled down to the footlights and
took that house up in the hollow of your hand and tickled it.“</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, July 21, 1885. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–You are really my only
author; I am restricted to you, I wouldn’t give a damn for the rest.</p>
<p>I bored through Middlemarch during the past week, with its labored
and tedious analyses of feelings and motives, its paltry and tiresome
people, its unexciting and uninteresting story, and its frequent
blinding flashes of single-sentence poetry, philosophy, wit, and what
not, and nearly died from the overwork. I wouldn’t read another of those
books for a farm. I did try to read one other–Daniel Deronda. I dragged
through three chapters, losing flesh all the time, and then was honest
enough to quit, and confess to myself that I haven’t any romance
literature appetite, as far as I can see, except for your books.</p>
<p>But what I started to say, was, that I have just read Part II of
Indian Summer, and to my mind there isn’t a waste line in it, or one
that could be improved. I read it yesterday, ending with that opinion;
and read it again to-day, ending with the same opinion emphasized. I
haven’t read Part I yet, because that number must have reached Hartford
after we left; but we are going to send down town for a copy, and when
it comes I am to read both parts aloud to the family. It is a beautiful
story, and makes a body laugh all the time, and cry inside, and feel so
old and so forlorn; and gives him gracious glimpses of his lost youth
that fill him with a measureless regret, and build up in him a cloudy
sense of his having been a prince, once, in some enchanted far-off land,
and of being an exile now, and desolate–and Lord, no chance ever to get
back there again! That is the thing that hurts. Well, you have done it
with marvelous facility and you make all the motives and feelings
perfectly clear without analyzing the guts out of them, the way George
Eliot does. I can’t stand George Eliot and Hawthorne and those people; I
see what they are at a hundred years before they get to it and they just
tire me to death. And as for “The Bostonians,“ I would rather be damned
to John Bunyan’s heaven than read that. Yrs Ever MARK</p>
<p>It is as easy to understand Mark Twain’s enjoyment of Indian Summer
as his revolt against Daniel Deronda and The Bostonians. He cared little
for writing that did not convey its purpose in the simplest and most
direct terms. It is interesting to note that in thanking Clemens for his
compliment Howells wrote: “What people cannot see is that I analyze as
little as possible; they go on talking about the analytical school,
which I am supposed to belong to, and I want to thank you for using your
eyes….. Did you ever read De Foe’s ‘Roxana’? If not, then read it, not
merely for some of the deepest insights into the lying, suffering,
sinning, well-meaning human soul, but for the best and most natural
English that a book was ever written in.“</p>
<p>General Grant worked steadily on his book, dictating when he could,
making brief notes on slips of paper when he could no longer speak.
Clemens visited him at Mt. McGregor and brought the dying soldier the
comforting news that enough of his books were already sold to provide
generously for his family, and that the sales would aggregate at least
twice as much by the end of the year.</p>
<p>This was some time in July. On the 23d of that month General Grant
died. Immediately there was a newspaper discussion as to the most
suitable place for the great chieftain to lie. Mark Twain’s contribution
to this debate, though in the form of an open letter, seems worthy of
preservation here.</p>
<p>To the New York “Sun,“ on the proper place for Grant’s Tomb:</p>
<p>To THE EDITOR OP’ THE SUN:–SIR,–The newspaper atmosphere is charged
with objections to New York as a place of sepulchre for General Grant,
and the objectors are strenuous that Washington is the right place. They
offer good reasons–good temporary reasons–for both of these
positions.</p>
<p>But it seems to me that temporary reasons are not mete for the
occasion. We need to consider posterity rather than our own generation.
We should select a grave which will not merely be in the right place
now, but will still be in the right place 500 years from now.</p>
<p>How does Washington promise as to that? You have only to hit it in
one place to kill it. Some day the west will be numerically strong
enough to move the seat of government; her past attempts are a fair
warning that when the day comes she will do it. Then the city of
Washington will lose its consequence and pass out of the public view and
public talk. It is quite within the possibilities that, a century hence,
people would wonder and say, “How did your predecessors come to bury
their great dead in this deserted place?“</p>
<p>But as long as American civilisation lasts New York will last. I
cannot but think she has been well and wisely chosen as the guardian of
a grave which is destined to become almost the most conspicuous in the
world’s history. Twenty centuries from now New York will still be New
York, still a vast city, and the most notable object in it will still be
the tomb and monument of General Grant.</p>
<p>I observe that the common and strongest objection to New York is that
she is not “national ground.“ Let us give ourselves no uneasiness about
that. Wherever General Grant’s body lies, that is national ground.</p>
<p>S. L. CLEMENS. ELMIRA, July 27.</p>
<p>The letter that follows is very long, but it seems too important and
too interesting to be omitted in any part. General Grant’s early
indulgence in liquors had long been a matter of wide, though not very
definite, knowledge. Every one had heard how Lincoln, on being told that
Grant drank, remarked something to the effect that he would like to know
what kind of whisky Grant used so that he might get some of it for his
other generals. Henry Ward Beecher, selected to deliver a eulogy on the
dead soldier, and doubtless wishing neither to ignore the matter nor to
make too much of it, naturally turned for information to the publisher
of Grant’s own memoirs, hoping from an advance copy to obtain light.</p>
<p>To Henry Ward Beecher,.Brooklyn:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, N. Y. Sept. 11, ’85. MY DEAR MR. BEECHER,–My nephew Webster
is in Europe making contracts for the Memoirs. Before he sailed he came
to me with a writing, directed to the printers and binders, to this
effect:</p>
<p>“Honor no order for a sight or copy of the Memoirs while I am absent,
even though it be signed by Mr. Clemens himself.“</p>
<p>I gave my permission. There were weighty reasons why I should not
only give my permission, but hold it a matter of honor to not dissolve
the order or modify it at any time. So I did all of that–said the order
should stand undisturbed to the end. If a principal could dissolve his
promise as innocently as he can dissolve his written order unguarded by
his promise, I would send you a copy of the Memoirs instantly. I did not
foresee you, or I would have made an exception.</p>
<p>………………………</p>
<p>My idea gained from army men, is that the drunkenness (and sometimes
pretty reckless spreeing, nights,) ceased before he came East to be Lt.
General. (Refer especially to Gen. Wm. B. Franklin–[If you could see
Franklin and talk with him–then he would unbosom,]) It was while Grant
was still in the West that Mr. Lincoln said he wished he could find out
what brand of whisky that fellow used, so he could furnish it to some of
the other generals. Franklin saw Grant tumble from his horse drunk,
while reviewing troops in New Orleans. The fall gave him a good deal of
a hurt. He was then on the point of leaving for the Chattanooga region.
I naturally put “that and that together“ when I read Gen. O. O.
Howards’s article in the Christian Union, three or four weeks ago–where
he mentions that the new General arrived lame from a recent accident.
(See that article.) And why not write Howard?</p>
<p>Franklin spoke positively of the frequent spreeing. In camp–in time
of war.</p>
<p>…………………….</p>
<p>Captain Grant was frequently threatened by the Commandant of his
Oregon post with a report to the War Department of his conduct unless he
modified his intemperance. The report would mean dismissal from the
service. At last the report had to be made out; and then, so greatly was
the captain beloved, that he was privately informed, and was thus
enabled to rush his resignation to Washington ahead of the report. Did
the report go, nevertheless? I don’t know. If it did, it is in the War
Department now, possibly, and seeable. I got all this from a regular
army man, but I can’t name him to save me.</p>
<p>The only time General Grant ever mentioned liquor to me was about
last April or possibly May. He said:</p>
<p>“If I could only build up my strength! The doctors urge whisky and
champagne; but I can’t take them; I can’t abide the taste of any kind of
liquor.“</p>
<p>Had he made a conquest so complete that even the taste of liquor was
become an offense? Or was he so sore over what had been said about his
habit that he wanted to persuade others and likewise himself that he
hadn’t even ever had any taste for it? It sounded like the latter, but
that’s no evidence.</p>
<p>He told me in the fall of ’84 that there was something the matter
with his throat, and that at the suggestion of his physicians he had
reduced his smoking to one cigar a day. Then he added, in a casual
fashion, that he didn’t care for that one, and seldom smoked it.</p>
<p>I could understand that feeling. He had set out to conquer not the
habit but the inclination–the desire. He had gone at the root, not the
trunk. It’s the perfect way and the only true way (I speak from
experience.) How I do hate those enemies of the human race who go around
enslaving God’s free people with pledges–to quit drinking instead of to
quit wanting to drink.</p>
<p>But Sherman and Van Vliet know everything concerning Grant; and if
you tell them how you want to use the facts, both of them will testify.
Regular army men have no concealments about each other; and yet they
make their awful statements without shade or color or malice with a
frankness and a child-like naivety, indeed, which is enchanting-and
stupefying. West Point seems to teach them that, among other priceless
things not to be got in any other college in this world. If we talked
about our guild-mates as I have heard Sherman, Grant, Van Vliet and
others talk about theirs–mates with whom they were on the best possible
terms–we could never expect them to speak to us again.</p>
<p>…………………..</p>
<p>I am reminded, now, of another matter. The day of the funeral I sat
an hour over a single drink and several cigars with Van Vliet and
Sherman and Senator Sherman; and among other things Gen. Sherman said,
with impatient scorn:</p>
<p>“The idea of all this nonsense about Grant not being able to stand
rude language and indelicate stories! Why Grant was full of humor, and
full of the appreciation of it. I have sat with him by the hour
listening to Jim Nye’s yarns, and I reckon you know the style of Jim
Nye’s histories, Clemens. It makes me sick–that newspaper nonsense.
Grant was no namby-pamby fool, he was a man–all over–rounded and
complete.“</p>
<p>I wish I had thought of it! I would have said to General Grant: “Put
the drunkenness in the Memoirs–and the repentance and reform. Trust the
people.“</p>
<p>But I will wager there is not a hint in the book. He was sore, there.
As much of the book as I have read gives no hint, as far as I
recollect.</p>
<p>The sick-room brought out the points of Gen. Grant’s character–some
of them particularly, to wit:</p>
<p>His patience; his indestructible equability of temper; his exceeding
gentleness, kindness, forbearance, lovingness, charity; his loyalty: to
friends, to convictions, to promises, half-promises, infinitesimal
fractions and shadows of promises; (There was a requirement of him which
I considered an atrocity, an injustice, an outrage; I wanted to implore
him to repudiate it; Fred Grant said, “Save your labor, I know him; he
is in doubt as to whether he made that half-promise or not–and, he will
give the thing the benefit of the doubt; he will fulfill that
half-promise or kill himself trying;“ Fred Grant was right–he did
fulfill it;) his aggravatingly trustful nature; his genuineness,
simplicity, modesty, diffidence, self-depreciation, poverty in the
quality of vanity-and, in no contradiction of this last, his simple
pleasure in the flowers and general ruck sent to him by Tom, Dick and
Harry from everywhere–a pleasure that suggested a perennial surprise
that he should be the object of so much fine attention–he was the most
lovable great child in the world; (I mentioned his loyalty: you remember
Harrison, the colored body-servant? the whole family hated him, but that
did not make any difference, the General always stood at his back,
wouldn’t allow him to be scolded; always excused his failures and
deficiencies with the one unvarying formula, “We are responsible for
these things in his race–it is not fair to visit our fault upon them
–let him alone;“ so they did let him alone, under compulsion, until the
great heart that was his shield was taken away; then–well they simply
couldn’t stand him, and so they were excusable for determining to
discharge him–a thing which they mortally hated to do, and by lucky
accident were saved from the necessity of doing;) his toughness as a
bargainer when doing business for other people or for his country
(witness his “terms“ at Donelson, Vicksburg, etc.; Fred Grant told me
his father wound up an estate for the widow and orphans of a friend in
St. Louis–it took several years; at the end every complication had been
straightened out, and the property put upon a prosperous basis; great
sums had passed through his hands, and when he handed over the papers
there were vouchers to show what had been done with every penny) and his
trusting, easy, unexacting fashion when doing business for himself (at
that same time he was paying out money in driblets to a man who was
running his farm for him–and in his first Presidency he paid every one
of those driblets again (total, ,000 F. said,) for he hadn’t a scrap of
paper to show that he had ever paid them before; in his dealings with me
he would not listen to terms which would place my money at risk and
leave him protected–the thought plainly gave him pain, and he put it
from him, waved it off with his hands, as one does accounts of crushings
and mutilations–wouldn’t listen, changed the subject;) and his
fortitude! He was under, sentence of death last spring; he sat thinking,
musing, several days–nobody knows what about; then he pulled himself
together and set to work to finish that book, a colossal task for a
dying man. Presently his hand gave out; fate seemed to have got him
checkmated. Dictation was suggested. No, he never could do that; had
never tried it; too old to learn, now. By and by–if he could only do
Appomattox-well. So he sent for a stenographer, and dictated 9,000 words
at a single sitting!–never pausing, never hesitating for a word, never
repeating –and in the written-out copy he made hardly a correction. He
dictated again, every two or three days–the intervals were intervals of
exhaustion and slow recuperation–and at last he was able to tell me that
he had written more matter than could be got into the book. I then
enlarged the book–had to. Then he lost his voice. He was not quite done
yet, however:–there was no end of little plums and spices to be stuck
in, here and there; and this work he patiently continued, a few lines a
day, with pad and pencil, till far into July, at Mt. McGregor. One day
he put his pencil aside, and said he was done–there was nothing more to
do. If I had been there I could have foretold the shock that struck the
world three days later.</p>
<p>Well, I’ve written all this, and it doesn’t seem to amount to
anything. But I do want to help, if I only could. I will enclose some
scraps from my Autobiography–scraps about General Grant–they may be of
some trifle of use, and they may not–they at least verify known traits
of his character. My Autobiography is pretty freely dictated, but my
idea is to jack-plane it a little before I die, some day or other; I
mean the rude construction and rotten grammar. It is the only dictating
I ever did, and it was most troublesome and awkward work. You may return
it to Hartford. Sincerely Yours S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The old long-deferred Library of Humor came up again for discussion,
when in the fall of 1885 Howells associated himself with Harper
andandandand Brothers. Howells’s contract provided that his name was not
to appear on any book not published by the Harper firm. He wrote,
therefore, offering to sell out his interest in the enterprise for two
thousand dollars, in addition to the five hundred which he had already
received–an amount considered to be less than he was to have received as
joint author and compiler. Mark Twain’s answer pretty fully covers the
details of this undertaking.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Oct. 18, 1885. Private.</p>
<p>MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I reckon it would ruin the book that is, make it
necessary to pigeon-hole it and leave it unpublished. I couldn’t publish
it without a very responsible name to support my own on the title page,
because it has so much of my own matter in it. I bought Osgood’s rights
for ,000 cash, I have paid Clark 00 and owe him 00 more, which must of
course be paid whether I publish or not. Yet I fully recognize that I
have no sort of moral right to let that ancient and procrastinated
contract hamper you in any way, and I most certainly won’t. So, it is my
decision,–after thinking over and rejecting the idea of trying to buy
permission of the Harpers for ,500 to use your name, (a proposition
which they would hate to refuse to a man in a perplexed position, and
yet would naturally have to refuse it,) to pigeon-hole the “Library“:
not destroy it, but merely pigeon-hole it and wait a few years and see
what new notion Providence will take concerning it. He will not desert
us now, after putting in four licks to our one on this book all this
time. It really seems in a sense discourteous not to call it
“Providence’s Library of Humor.“</p>
<p>Now that deal is all settled, the next question is, do you need and
must you require that ,000 now? Since last March, you know, I am
carrying a mighty load, solitary and alone–General Grant’s book–and must
carry it till the first volume is 30 days old (Jan. 1st) before the
relief money will begin to flow in. From now till the first of January
every dollar is as valuable to me as it could be to a famishing tramp.
If you can wait till then–I mean without discomfort, without
inconvenience–it will be a large accommodation to me; but I will not
allow you to do this favor if it will discommode you. So, speak right
out, frankly, and if you need the money I will go out on the highway and
get it, using violence, if necessary.</p>
<p>Mind, I am not in financial difficulties, and am not going to be. I
am merely a starving beggar standing outside the door of
plenty–obstructed by a Yale time-lock which is set for Jan. 1st. I can
stand it, and stand it perfectly well; but the days do seem to fool
along considerable slower than they used to.</p>
<p>I am mighty glad you are with the Harpers. I have noticed that good
men in their employ go there to stay. Yours ever, MARK.</p>
<p>In the next letter we begin to get some idea of the size of Mark
Twain’s first publishing venture, and a brief summary of results may not
be out of place here.</p>
<p>The Grant Life was issued in two volumes. In the early months of the
year when the agents’ canvass was just beginning, Mark Twain, with what
seems now almost clairvoyant vision, prophesied a sale of three hundred
thousand sets. The actual sales ran somewhat more than this number. On
February 27, 1886, Charles L. Webster andandandand Co. paid to
Mrs. Grant the largest single royalty check in the history of
book-publishing. The amount of it was two hundred thousand dollars.
Subsequent checks increased the aggregate return to considerably more
than double this figure. In a memorandum made by Clemens in the midst of
the canvass he wrote.“</p>
<p>“During 100 consecutive days the sales (i. e., subscriptions) of
General Grant’s book averaged 3,000 sets (6,000 single volumes) per day:
Roughly stated, Mrs. Grant’s income during all that time was ,000 a
day.“</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HOTEL NORMANDIE NEW YORK, Dec. 2, ’85. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I told
Webster, this afternoon, to send you that ,000; but he is in such a
rush, these first days of publication, that he may possibly forget it;
so I write lest I forget it too. Remind me, if he should forget. When I
postponed you lately, I did it because I thought I should be cramped for
money until January, but that has turned out to be an error, so I hasten
to cut short the postponement.</p>
<p>I judge by the newspapers that you are in Auburndale, but I don’t
know it officially.</p>
<p>I’ve got the first volume launched safely; consequently, half of the
suspense is over, and I am that much nearer the goal. We’ve bound and
shipped 200,000 books; and by the 10th shall finish and ship the
remaining 125,000 of the first edition. I got nervous and came down to
help hump-up the binderies; and I mean to stay here pretty much all the
time till the first days of March, when the second volume will issue.
Shan’t have so much trouble, this time, though, if we get to press
pretty soon, because we can get more binderies then than are to be had
in front of the holidays. One lives and learns. I find it takes 7
binderies four months to bind 325,000 books.</p>
<p>This is a good book to publish. I heard a canvasser say, yesterday,
that while delivering eleven books he took 7 new subscriptions. But we
shall be in a hell of a fix if that goes on–it will “ball up“ the
binderies again. Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>November 30th that year was Mark Twain’s fiftieth birthday, an event
noticed by the newspapers generally, and especially observed by many of
his friends. Warner, Stockton and many others sent letters; Andrew Lang
contributed a fine poem; also Oliver Wendell. Holmes –the latter by
special request of Miss Gilder–for the Critic. These attentions came as
a sort of crowning happiness at the end of a golden year. At no time in
his life were Mark Twain’s fortunes and prospects brighter; he had a
beautiful family and a perfect home. Also, he had great prosperity. The
reading-tour with Cable had been a fine success. His latest book, The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, had added largely to his fame and
income. The publication of the Grant Memoirs had been a dazzling
triumph. Mark Twain had become recognized, not only as America’s most
distinguished author, but as its most envied publisher. And now, with
his fiftieth birthday, had come this laurel from Holmes, last of the
Brahmins, to add a touch of glory to all the rest. We feel his
exaltation in his note of acknowledgment.</p>
<p>To Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in Boston:</p>
<p>DEAR MR. HOLMES,–I shall never be able to tell you the half of how
proud you have made me. If I could you would say you were nearly paid
for the trouble you took. And then the family: If I can convey the
electrical surprise and gratitude and exaltation of the wife and the
children last night, when they happened upon that Critic where I had,
with artful artlessness, spread it open and retired out of view to see
what would happen–well, it was great and fine and beautiful to see, and
made me feel as the victor feels when the shouting hosts march by; and
if you also could have seen it you would have said the account was
squared. For I have brought them up in your company, as in the company
of a warm and friendly and beneficent but far-distant sun; and so, for
you to do this thing was for the sun to send down out of the skies the
miracle of a special ray and transfigure me before their faces. I knew
what that poem would be to them; I knew it would raise me up to remote
and shining heights in their eyes, to very fellowship with the chambered
Nautilus itself, and that from that fellowship they could never more
dissociate me while they should live; and so I made sure to be by when
the surprise should come.</p>
<p>Charles Dudley Warner is charmed with the poem for its own felicitous
sake; and so indeed am I, but more because it has drawn the sting of my
fiftieth year; taken away the pain of it, the grief of it, the somehow
shame of it, and made me glad and proud it happened.</p>
<p>With reverence and affection, Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Holmes wrote with his own hand: “Did Miss Gilder tell you I had
twenty-three letters spread out for answer when her suggestion came
about your anniversary? I stopped my correspondence and made my letters
wait until the lines were done.“</p>
