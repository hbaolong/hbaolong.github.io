<h4 id="the-undertakers-chat">THE UNDERTAKER’S CHAT</h4>
<p>“Now that corpse,“ said the undertaker, patting the folded hands of
deceased approvingly, was a brick-every way you took him he was a brick.
He was so real accommodating, and so modest-like and simple in his last
moments. Friends wanted metallic burial-case–nothing else would do. I
couldn’t get it. There warn’t going to be time–anybody could see
that.</p>
<p>“Corpse said never mind, shake him up some kind of a box he could
stretch out in comfortable, he warn’t particular ’bout the general style
of it. Said he went more on room than style, anyway in a last final
container.</p>
<p>“Friends wanted a silver door-plate on the coffin, signifying who he
was and wher’ he was from. Now you know a fellow couldn’t roust out such
a gaily thing as that in a little country-town like this. What did
corpse say?</p>
<p>“Corpse said, whitewash his old canoe and dob his address and general
destination onto it with a blacking-brush and a stencil-plate, ‘long
with a verse from some likely hymn or other, and pint him for the tomb,
and mark him C. O. D., and just let him flicker. He warn’t distressed
any more than you be–on the contrary, just as ca,’m and collected as a
hearse-horse; said he judged that wher’ he was going to a body would
find it considerable better to attract attention by a picturesque moral
character than a natty burial-case with a swell door-plate on it.</p>
<p>“Splendid man, he was. I’d druther do for a corpse like that ‘n any
I’ve tackled in seven year. There’s some satisfaction in buryin’ a man
like that. You feel that what you’re doing is appreciated. Lord bless
you, so’s he got planted before he sp’iled, he was perfectly satisfied;
said his relations meant well, perfectly well, but all them preparations
was bound to delay the thing more or less, and he didn’t wish to be kept
layin’ around. You never see such a clear head as what he had–and so
ca,’m and so cool. Jist a hunk of brains–that is what he was. Perfectly
awful. It was a ripping distance from one end of that man’s head to
t’other. Often and over again he’s had brain-fever a-raging in one
place, and the rest of the pile didn’t know anything about it–didn’t
affect it any more than an Injun Insurrection in Arizona affects the
Atlantic States.</p>
<p>“Well, the relations they wanted a big funeral, but corpse said he
was down on flummery–didn,‘t want any procession–fill the hearse full of
mourners, and get out a stern line and tow him behind. He was the most
down on style of any remains I ever struck. A beautiful, simpleminded
creature it was what he was, you can depend on that. He was just set on
having things the way he wanted them, and he took a solid comfort in
laying his little plans. He had me measure him and take a whole raft of
directions; then he had the minister stand up behind along box with a
table–cloth over it, to represent the coffin, and read his funeral
sermon, saying ’Angcore, angcore!’ at the good places, and making him
scratch out every bit of brag about him, and all the hifalutin; and then
he made them trot out the choir, so’s he could help them pick out the
tunes for the occasion, and he got them to sing ‘Pop Goes the Weasel,’
because he’d always liked that tune when he was downhearted, and solemn
music made him sad; and when they sung that with tears in their eyes
(because they all loved him), and his relations grieving around, he just
laid there as happy as a bug, and trying to beat time and showing all
over how much he enjoyed it; and presently he got worked up and excited,
and tried to join in, for, mind you, he was pretty proud of his
abilities in the singing line; but the first time he opened his mouth
and was just going to spread himself his breath took a walk.</p>
<p>“I never see a man snuffed out so sudden. Ah, it was a great loss–a,
powerful loss to this poor little one-horse town. Well, well, well, I
hain’t got time to be palavering along here–got to nail on the lid and
mosey along with him; and if you’ll just give me a lift we’ll skeet him
into the hearse and meander along. Relations bound to have it so–don’t
pay no attention to dying injunctions, minute a corpse’s gone; but, if I
had my way, if I didn’t respect his last wishes and tow him behind the
hearse I’ll be cuss’d. I consider that whatever a corpse wants done for
his comfort is little enough matter, and a man hain’t got no right to
deceive him or take advantage of him; and whatever a corpse trusts me to
do I’m a-going to do, you know, even if it’s to stuff him and paint him
yaller and keep him for a keepsake–you hear me!“</p>
<p>He cracked his whip and went lumbering away with his ancient ruin of
a hearse, and I continued my walk with a valuable lesson learned–that a
healthy and wholesome cheerfulness is not necessarily impossible to any
occupation. The lesson is likely to be lasting, for it will take many
months to obliterate the memory of the remarks and circumstances that
impressed it.</p>
