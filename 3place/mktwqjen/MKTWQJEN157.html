<h4 id="chapter-xiii.">CHAPTER XIII.</h4>
<p>What ever to say be toke in his entente, his langage was so fayer
andandandand pertynante, yt semeth unto manys herying not only the
worde, but veryly the thyng. Caxton’s Book of Curtesye.</p>
<p>In the party of which our travelers found themselves members, was
Duff Brown, the great railroad contractor, and subsequently a well-known
member of Congress; a bluff, jovial Bost’n man, thick-set, close shaven,
with a heavy jaw and a low forehead–a very pleasant man if you were not
in his way. He had government contracts also, custom houses and dry
docks, from Portland to New Orleans, and managed to get out of congress,
in appropriations, about weight for weight of gold for the stone
furnished.</p>
<p>Associated with him, and also of this party, was Rodney Schaick, a
sleek New York broker, a man as prominent in the church as in the stock
exchange, dainty in his dress, smooth of speech, the necessary
complement of Duff Brown in any enterprise that needed assurance and
adroitness.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to find a pleasanter traveling party one that
shook off more readily the artificial restraints of Puritanic
strictness, and took the world with good-natured allowance. Money was
plenty for every attainable luxury, and there seemed to be no doubt that
its supply would continue, and that fortunes were about to be made
without a great deal of toil. Even Philip soon caught the prevailing
spirit; Barry did not need any inoculation, he always talked in six
figures. It was as natural for the dear boy to be rich as it is for most
people to be poor.</p>
<p>The elders of the party were not long in discovering the fact, which
almost all travelers to the west soon find out; that the water was poor.
It must have been by a lucky premonition of this that they all had
brandy flasks with which to qualify the water of the country; and it was
no doubt from an uneasy feeling of the danger of being poisoned that
they kept experimenting, mixing a little of the dangerous and changing
fluid, as they passed along, with the contents of the flasks, thus
saving their lives hour by hour. Philip learned afterwards that
temperance and the strict observance of Sunday and a certain gravity of
deportment are geographical habits, which people do not usually carry
with them away from home.</p>
<p>Our travelers stopped in Chicago long enough to see that they could
make their fortunes there in two week’s tine, but it did not seem worth
while; the west was more attractive; the further one went the wider the
opportunities opened.</p>
<p>They took railroad to Alton and the steamboat from there to
St. Louis, for the change and to have a glimpse of the river.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this jolly?“ cried Henry, dancing out of the barber’s room,
and coming down the deck with a one, two, three step, shaven, curled and
perfumed after his usual exquisite fashion.</p>
<p>“What’s jolly?“ asked Philip, looking out upon the dreary and
monotonous waste through which the shaking steamboat was coughing its
way.</p>
<p>“Why, the whole thing; it’s immense I can tell you. I wouldn’t give
that to be guaranteed a hundred thousand cold cash in a year’s
time.“</p>
<p>“Where’s Mr. Brown?“</p>
<p>“He is in the saloon, playing poker with Schaick and that long haired
party with the striped trousers, who scrambled aboard when the stage
plank was half hauled in, and the big Delegate to Congress from out
west.“</p>
<p>“That’s a fine looking fellow, that delegate, with his glossy, black
whiskers; looks like a Washington man; I shouldn’t think he’d be at
poker.“</p>
<p>“Oh, its only five cent ante, just to make it interesting, the
Delegate said.“</p>
<p>“But I shouldn’t think a representative in Congress would play poker
any way in a public steamboat.“</p>
<p>“Nonsense, you’ve got to pass the time. I tried a hand myself, but
those old fellows are too many for me. The Delegate knows all the
points. I’d bet a hundred dollars he will ante his way right into the
United States Senate when his territory comes in. He’s got the cheek for
it.“</p>
<p>“He has the grave and thoughtful manner of expectoration of a public
man, for one thing,“ added Philip.</p>
<p>“Harry,“ said Philip, after a pause, “what have you got on those big
boots for; do you expect to wade ashore?“</p>
<p>“I’m breaking ’em in.“</p>
<p>The fact was Harry had got himself up in what he thought a proper
costume for a new country, and was in appearance a sort of compromise
between a dandy of Broadway and a backwoodsman. Harry, with blue eyes,
fresh complexion, silken whiskers and curly chestnut hair, was as
handsome as a fashion plate. He wore this morning a soft hat, a short
cutaway coat, an open vest displaying immaculate linen, a leathern belt
round his waist, and top-boots of soft leather, well polished, that came
above his knees and required a string attached to his belt to keep them
up. The light hearted fellow gloried in these shining encasements of his
well shaped legs, and told Philip that they were a perfect protection
against prairie rattle-snakes, which never strike above the knee.</p>
<p>The landscape still wore an almost wintry appearance when our
travelers left Chicago. It was a genial spring day when they landed at
St. Louis; the birds were singing, the blossoms of peach trees in city
garden plots, made the air sweet, and in the roar and tumult on the long
river levee they found an excitement that accorded with their own
hopeful anticipations.</p>
<p>The party went to the Southern Hotel, where the great Duff Brown was
very well known, and indeed was a man of so much importance that even
the office clerk was respectful to him. He might have respected in him
also a certain vulgar swagger and insolence of money, which the clerk
greatly admired.</p>
<p>The young fellows liked the house and liked the city; it seemed to
them a mighty free and hospitable town. Coming from the East they were
struck with many peculiarities. Everybody smoked in the streets, for one
thing, they noticed; everybody “took a drink“ in an open manner whenever
he wished to do so or was asked, as if the habit needed no concealment
or apology. In the evening when they walked about they found people
sitting on the door-steps of their dwellings, in a manner not usual in a
northern city; in front of some of the hotels and saloons the side walks
were filled with chairs and benches–Paris fashion, said Harry–upon which
people lounged in these warm spring evenings, smoking, always smoking;
and the clink of glasses and of billiard balls was in the air. It was
delightful.</p>
<p>Harry at once found on landing that his back-woods custom would not
be needed in St. Louis, and that, in fact, he had need of all the
resources of his wardrobe to keep even with the young swells of the
town. But this did not much matter, for Harry was always superior to his
clothes. As they were likely to be detained some time in the city, Harry
told Philip that he was going to improve his time. And he did. It was an
encouragement to any industrious man to see this young fellow rise,
carefully dress himself, eat his breakfast deliberately, smoke his cigar
tranquilly, and then repair to his room, to what he called his work,
with a grave and occupied manner, but with perfect cheerfulness.</p>
<p>Harry would take off his coat, remove his cravat, roll up his
shirt-sleeves, give his curly hair the right touch before the glass, get
out his book on engineering, his boxes of instruments, his drawing
paper, his profile paper, open the book of logarithms, mix his India
ink, sharpen his pencils, light a cigar, and sit down at the table to
“lay out a line,“ with the most grave notion that he was mastering the
details of engineering. He would spend half a day in these preparations
without ever working out a problem or having the faintest conception of
the use of lines or logarithms. And when he had finished, he had the
most cheerful confidence that he had done a good day’s work.</p>
<p>It made no difference, however, whether Harry was in his room in a
hotel or in a tent, Philip soon found, he was just the same. In camp he
would get himself, up in the most elaborate toilet at his command,
polish his long boots to the top, lay out his work before him, and spend
an hour or longer, if anybody was looking at him, humming airs, knitting
his brows, and “working“ at engineering; and if a crowd of gaping
rustics were looking on all the while it was perfectly satisfactory to
him.</p>
<p>“You see,“ he says to Philip one morning at the hotel when he was
thus engaged, “I want to get the theory of this thing, so that I can
have a check on the engineers.“</p>
<p>“I thought you were going to be an engineer yourself,“ queried
Philip.</p>
<p>“Not many times, if the court knows herself. There’s better game.
Brown and Schaick have, or will have, the control for the whole line of
the Salt Lick Pacific Extension, forty thousand dollars a mile over the
prairie, with extra for hard-pan–and it’ll be pretty much all hardpan I
can tell you; besides every alternate section of land on this line.
There’s millions in the job. I’m to have the sub-contract for the first
fifty miles, and you can bet it’s a soft thing.“</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what you do, Philip,“ continued Larry, in a burst of
generosity, “if I don’t get you into my contract, you’ll be with the
engineers, and you jest stick a stake at the first ground marked for a
depot, buy the land of the farmer before he knows where the depot will
be, and we’ll turn a hundred or so on that. I’ll advance the money for
the payments, and you can sell the lots. Schaick is going to let me have
ten thousand just for a flyer in such operations.“</p>
<p>“But that’s a good deal of money.“</p>
<p>“Wait till you are used to handling money. I didn’t come out here for
a bagatelle. My uncle wanted me to stay East and go in on the Mobile
custom house, work up the Washington end of it; he said there was a
fortune in it for a smart young fellow, but I preferred to take the
chances out here. Did I tell you I had an offer from Bobbett and Fanshaw
to go into their office as confidential clerk on a salary of ten
thousand?“</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you take it ?“ asked Philip, to whom a salary of two
thousand would have seemed wealth, before he started on this
journey.</p>
<p>“Take it? I’d rather operate on my own hook;“ said Harry, in his most
airy manner.</p>
<p>A few evenings after their arrival at the Southern, Philip and Harry
made the acquaintance of a very agreeable gentleman, whom they had
frequently seen before about the hotel corridors, and passed a casual
word with. He had the air of a man of business, and was evidently a
person of importance.</p>
<p>The precipitating of this casual intercourse into the more
substantial form of an acquaintanceship was the work of the gentleman
himself, and occurred in this wise. Meeting the two friends in the lobby
one evening, he asked them to give him the time, and added:</p>
<p>“Excuse me, gentlemen–strangers in St. Louis? Ah, yes-yes. From the
East, perhaps? Ah; just so, just so. Eastern born myself–Virginia.
Sellers is my name–Beriah Sellers.</p>
<p>“Ah! by the way–New York, did you say? That reminds me; just met some
gentlemen from your State, a week or two ago–very prominent gentlemen
–in public life they are; you must know them, without doubt. Let me see
–let me see. Curious those names have escaped me. I know they were from
your State, because I remember afterward my old friend Governor
Shackleby said to me–fine man, is the Governor–one of the finest men our
country has produced–said he, ‘Colonel, how did you like those New York
gentlemen?–not many such men in the world,–Colonel Sellers,’ said the
Governor–yes, it was New York he said–I remember it distinctly. I can’t
recall those names, somehow. But no matter. Stopping here,
gentlemen–stopping at the Southern?“</p>
<p>In shaping their reply in their minds, the title “Mr.“ had a place in
it; but when their turn had arrived to speak, the title “Colonel“ came
from their lips instead.</p>
<p>They said yes, they were abiding at the Southern, and thought it a
very good house.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, the Southern is fair. I myself go to the Planter’s, old,
aristocratic house. We Southern gentlemen don’t change our ways, you
know. I always make it my home there when I run down from Hawkeye–my
plantation is in Hawkeye, a little up in the country. You should know
the Planter’s.“</p>
<p>Philip and Harry both said they should like to see a hotel that had
been so famous in its day–a cheerful hostelrie, Philip said it must have
been where duels were fought there across the dining-room table.</p>
<p>“You may believe it, sir, an uncommonly pleasant lodging. Shall we
walk?“</p>
<p>And the three strolled along the streets, the Colonel talking all the
way in the most liberal and friendly manner, and with a frank
open-heartedness that inspired confidence.</p>
<p>“Yes, born East myself, raised all along, know the West–a great
country, gentlemen. The place for a young fellow of spirit to pick up a
fortune, simply pick it up, it’s lying round loose here. Not a day that
I don’t put aside an opportunity; too busy to look into it. Management
of my own property takes my time. First visit? Looking for an
opening?“</p>
<p>“Yes, looking around,“ replied Harry.</p>
<p>“Ah, here we are. You’d rather sit here in front than go to my
apartments? So had I. An opening eh?“</p>
<p>The Colonel’s eyes twinkled. “Ah, just so. The country is opening up,
all we want is capital to develop it. Slap down the rails and bring the
land into market. The richest land on God Almighty’s footstool is lying
right out there. If I had my capital free I could plant it for
millions.“</p>
<p>“I suppose your capital is largely in your plantation?“ asked
Philip.</p>
<p>“Well, partly, sir, partly. I’m down here now with reference to a
little operation–a little side thing merely. By the way gentlemen,
excuse the liberty, but it’s about my usual time“–</p>
<p>The Colonel paused, but as no movement of his acquaintances followed
this plain remark, he added, in an explanatory manner,</p>
<p>“I’m rather particular about the exact time–have to be in this
climate.“</p>
<p>Even this open declaration of his hospitable intention not being
understood the Colonel politely said,</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, will you take something?“</p>
<p>Col. Sellers led the way to a saloon on Fourth street under the
hotel, and the young gentlemen fell into the custom of the country.</p>
<p>“Not that,“ said the Colonel to the bar-keeper, who shoved along the
counter a bottle of apparently corn-whiskey, as if he had done it before
on the same order; “not that,“ with a wave of the hand. “That Otard if
you please. Yes. Never take an inferior liquor, gentlemen, not in the
evening, in this climate. There. That’s the stuff. My respects!“</p>
<p>The hospitable gentleman, having disposed of his liquor, remarking
that it was not quite the thing–“when a man has his own cellar to go to,
he is apt to get a little fastidious about his liquors“–called for
cigars. But the brand offered did not suit him; he motioned the box
away, and asked for some particular Havana’s, those in separate
wrappers.</p>
<p>“I always smoke this sort, gentlemen; they are a little more
expensive, but you’ll learn, in this climate, that you’d better not
economize on poor cigars“</p>
<p>Having imparted this valuable piece of information, the Colonel
lighted the fragrant cigar with satisfaction, and then carelessly put
his fingers into his right vest pocket. That movement being without
result, with a shade of disappointment on his face, he felt in his left
vest pocket. Not finding anything there, he looked up with a serious and
annoyed air, anxiously slapped his right pantaloon’s pocket, and then
his left, and exclaimed,</p>
<p>“By George, that’s annoying. By George, that’s mortifying. Never had
anything of that kind happen to me before. I’ve left my pocket-book.
Hold! Here’s a bill, after all. No, thunder, it’s a receipt.“</p>
<p>“Allow me,“ said Philip, seeing how seriously the Colonel was
annoyed, and taking out his purse.</p>
<p>The Colonel protested he couldn’t think of it, and muttered something
to the barkeeper about “hanging it up,“ but the vender of exhilaration
made no sign, and Philip had the privilege of paying the costly shot;
Col. Sellers profusely apologizing and claiming the right “next time,
next time.“</p>
<p>As soon as Beriah Sellers had bade his friends good night and seen
them depart, he did not retire apartments in the Planter’s, but took his
way to his lodgings with a friend in a distant part of the city.</p>
