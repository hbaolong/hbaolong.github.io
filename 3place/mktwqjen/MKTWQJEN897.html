<h4 id="letter-to-orion-clemens-in-carson-city">LETTER to Orion Clemens,
in Carson City:</h4>
<p>ESMERALDA, Thursday. MY DEAR BRO.,–Yours of the 17th, per express,
just received. Part of it pleased me exceedingly, and part of it didn’t.
Concerning the letter, for instance: You have PROMISED me that you would
leave all mining matters, and everything involving an outlay of money,
in my hands.</p>
<p>Sending a man fooling around the country after ledges, for God’s
sake! when there are hundreds of feet of them under my nose here,
begging for owners, free of charge. I don’t want any more feet, and I
won’t touch another foot–so you see, Orion, as far as any ledges of
Perry’s are concerned, (or any other except what I examine first with my
own eyes,) I freely yield my right to share ownership with you.</p>
<p>The balance of your letter, I say, pleases me exceedingly. Especially
that about the H. and D. being worth from 0 to 0 in Cal. It pleases me
because, if the ledges prove to be worthless, it will be a pleasant
reflection to know that others were beaten worse than ourselves. Raish
sold a man 30 feet, yesterday, at 0 a foot, although I was present at
the sale, and told the man the ground wasn’t worth a d—n. He said he had
been hankering after a few feet in the H. and D. for a long time, and he
had got them at last, and he couldn’t help thinking he had secured a
good thing. We went and looked at the ledges, and both of them
acknowledged that there was nothing in them but good “indications.“ Yet
the owners in the H. and D. will part with anything else sooner than
with feet in these ledges. Well, the work goes slowly–very slowly on, in
the tunnel, and we’ll strike it some day. But–if we “strike it
rich,“–I’ve lost my guess, that’s all. I expect that the way it got so
high in Cal. was, that Raish’s brother, over there was offered 50.00 for
20 feet of it, and he refused …..</p>
<p>Couldn’t go on the hill today. It snowed. It always snows here, I
expect.</p>
<p>Don’t you suppose they have pretty much quit writing, at home?</p>
<p>When you receive your next 1/4 yr’s salary, don’t send any of it here
until after you have told me you have got it. Remember this. I am afraid
of that H. and D.</p>
<p>They have struck the ledge in the Live Yankee tunnel, and I told the
President, Mr. Allen, that it wasn’t as good as the croppings. He said
that was true enough, but they would hang to it until it did prove rich.
He is much of a gentleman, that man Allen.</p>
<p>And ask Gaslerie why the devil he don’t send along my commission as
Deputy Sheriff. The fact of my being in California, and out of his
country, wouldn’t amount to a d—n with me, in the performance of my
official duties.</p>
<p>I have nothing to report, at present, except that I shall find out
all I want to know about this locality before I leave it.</p>
<p>How do the Records pay? Yr. Bro. SAM.</p>
<p>In one of the foregoing letters–the one dated May 11 there is a
reference to the writer’s “Enterprise Letters.“ Sometimes, during idle
days in the camp, the miner had followed old literary impulses and
written an occasional burlesque sketch, which he had signed “Josh,“ and
sent to the Territorial Enterprise, at Virginia City. –[One contribution
was sent to a Keokuk paper, The Gate City, and a letter written by
Mrs. Jane Clemens at the time would indicate that Mark Twain’s mother
did not always approve of her son’s literary efforts. She hopes that he
will do better, and some time write something “that his kin will be
proud of.“]–The rough, vigorous humor of these had attracted some
attention, and Orion, pleased with any measure of success that might
come to his brother, had allowed the authorship of them to become known.
When, in July, the financial situation became desperate, the Esmeralda
miner was moved to turn to literature for relief. But we will let him
present the situation himself.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in Carson City:</p>
<p>ESMERALDA, July 23d, 1862. MY DEAR BRO.,–No, I don’t own a foot in
the “Johnson“ ledge–I will tell the story some day in a more
intelligible manner than Tom has told it. You needn’t take the trouble
to deny Tom’s version, though. I own 25 feet (1-16) of the 1st east ex.
on it–and Johnson himself has contracted to find the ledge for 100 feet.
Contract signed yesterday. But as the ledge will be difficult to find he
is allowed six months to find it in. An eighteenth of the Ophir was a
fortune to John D. Winters–and the Ophir can’t beat the Johnson
any…..</p>
<p>My debts are greater than I thought for; I bought 5 worth of
clothing, and sent 5 to Higbie, in the cement diggings. I owe about 5 or
0, and have got about 5 in my pocket. But how in the h–l I am going to
live on something over 00 until October or November, is singular. The
fact is, I must have something to do, and that shortly, too…..</p>
<p>Now write to the Sacramento Union folks, or to Marsh, and tell them
I’ll write as many letters a week as they want, for 0 a week–my board
must be paid. Tell them I have corresponded with the N. Orleans
Crescent, and other papers–and the Enterprise. California is full of
people who have interests here, and it’s d—d seldom they hear from this
country. I can’t write a specimen letter–now, at any rate–I’d rather
undertake to write a Greek poem. Tell ’em the mail and express leave
three times a week, and it costs from 25 to 50 cents to send letters by
the blasted express. If they want letters from here, who’ll run from
morning till night collecting materials cheaper. I’ll write a short
letter twice a week, for the present, for the “Age,“ for per week. Now
it has been a long time since I couldn’t make my own living, and it
shall be a long time before I loaf another year…..</p>
<p>If I get the other 25 feet in the Johnson ex., I shan’t care a
d—n. I’ll be willing to curse awhile and wait. And if I can’t move the
bowels of those hills this fall, I will come up and clerk for you until
I get money enough to go over the mountains for the winter. Yr. Bro.
SAM.</p>
<p>The Territorial Enterprise at Virginia City was at this time owned by
Joseph T. Goodman, who had bought it on the eve of the great Comstock
silver-mining boom, and from a struggling, starving sheet had converted
it into one of the most important–certainly the most picturesque-papers
on the coast. The sketches which the Esmeralda miner had written over
the name of “Josh“ fitted into it exactly, and when a young man named
Barstow, in the business office, urged Goodman to invite “Josh“ to join
their staff, the Enterprise owner readily fell in with the idea. Among a
lot of mining matters of no special interest, Clemens, July 30th, wrote
his brother: “Barstow has offered me the post as local reporter for the
Enterprise at 5 a week, and I have written him that I will let him know
next mail, if possible.“</p>
<p>In Roughing It we are told that the miner eagerly accepted the
proposition to come to Virginia City, but the letters tell a different
story. Mark Twain was never one to abandon any undertaking easily. His
unwillingness to surrender in a lost cause would cost him more than one
fortune in the years to come. A week following the date of the foregoing
he was still undecided.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in Carson City:</p>
<p>ESMERALDA, Aug. 7, 1862. MY DEAR BRO,–Barstow wrote that if I wanted
the place I could have it. I wrote him that I guessed I would take it,
and asked him how long before I must come up there. I have not heard
from him since.</p>
<p>Now, I shall leave at mid-night tonight, alone and on foot for a walk
of 60 or 70 miles through a totally uninhabited country, and it is
barely possible that mail facilities may prove infernally “slow“ during
the few weeks I expect to spend out there. But do you write Barstow that
I have left here for a week or so, and in case he should want me he must
write me here, or let me know through you.</p>
<p>The Contractors say they will strike the Fresno next week. After
fooling with those assayers a week, they concluded not to buy
“Mr. Flower“ at 0, although they would have given five times the sum for
it four months ago. So I have made out a deed for one half of all
Johnny’s ground and acknowledged and left in judge F. K. Becktel’s
hands, and if judge Turner wants it he must write to Becktel and pay him
his Notary fee of .50. I would have paid that fee myself, but I want
money now as I leave town tonight. However, if you think it isn’t right,
you can pay the fee to judge Turner yourself.</p>
<p>Hang to your money now. I may want some when I get back…..</p>
<p>See that you keep out of debt-to anybody. Bully for B.! Write him
that I would write him myself, but I am to take a walk tonight and
haven’t time. Tell him to bring his family out with him. He can rely
upon what I say–and I say the land has lost its ancient desolate
appearance; the rose and the oleander have taken the place of the
departed sage-bush; a rich black loam, garnished with moss, and flowers,
and the greenest of grass, smiles to Heaven from the vanished
sand-plains; the “endless snows“ have all disappeared, and in their
stead, or to repay us for their loss, the mountains rear their billowy
heads aloft, crowned with a fadeless and eternal verdure; birds, and
fountains, and trees-tropical bees–everywhere!–and the poet dreamt of
Nevada when he wrote:</p>
<p>“and Sharon waves, in solemn praise, Her silent groves of palm.“</p>
<p>and today the royal Raven listens in a dreamy stupor to the songs of
the thrush and the nightingale and the canary–and shudders when the
gaudy-plumaged birds of the distant South sweep by him to the orange
groves of Carson. Tell him he wouldn’t recognize the d–d country. He
should bring his family by all means.</p>
<p>I intended to write home, but I haven’t done it. Yr. Bro. SAM.</p>
<p>In this letter we realize that he had gone into the wilderness to
reflect–to get a perspective on the situation. He was a great walker in
those days, and sometimes with Higbie, sometimes alone, made long
excursions. One such is recorded in Roughing It, the trip to Mono Lake.
We have no means of knowing where his seventy-mile tour led him now, but
it is clear that he still had not reached a decision on his return.
Indeed, we gather that he is inclined to keep up the battle among the
barren Esmeralda hills.</p>
<p>Last mining letter; written to Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>ESMERALDA, CAL., Aug. 15, 1862. MY DEAR SISTER,-I mailed a letter to
you and Ma this morning, but since then I have received yours to Orion
and me. Therefore, I must answer right away, else I may leave town
without doing it at all. What in thunder are pilot’s wages to me? which
question, I beg humbly to observe, is of a general nature, and not
discharged particularly at you. But it is singular, isn’t it, that such
a matter should interest Orion, when it is of no earthly consequence to
me? I never have once thought of returning home to go on the river
again, and I never expect to do any more piloting at any price. My
livelihood must be made in this country –and if I have to wait longer
than I expected, let it be so–I have no fear of failure. You know I have
extravagant hopes, for Orion tells you everything which he ought to keep
to himself–but it’s his nature to do that sort of thing, and I let him
alone. I did think for awhile of going home this fall–but when I found
that that was and had been the cherished intention and the darling
aspiration every year, of these old care-worn Californians for twelve
weary years–I felt a little uncomfortable, but I stole a march on
Disappointment and said I would not go home this fall. I will spend the
winter in San Francisco, if possible. Do not tell any one that I had any
idea of piloting again at present–for it is all a mistake. This country
suits me, and–it shall suit me, whether or no….</p>
<p>Dan Twing and I and Dan’s dog, “cabin“ together–and will continue to
do so for awhile–until I leave for–</p>
<p>The mansion is 10x12, with a “domestic“ roof. Yesterday it rained–the
first shower for five months. “Domestic,“ it appears to me, is not
water-proof. We went outside to keep from getting wet. Dan makes the bed
when it is his turn to do it–and when it is my turn, I don’t, you know.
The dog is not a good hunter, and he isn’t worth shucks to watch –but he
scratches up the dirt floor of the cabin, and catches flies, and makes
himself generally useful in the way of washing dishes. Dan gets up first
in the morning and makes a fire–and I get up last and sit by it, while
he cooks breakfast. We have a cold lunch at noon, and I cook supper–very
much against my will. However, one must have one good meal a day, and if
I were to live on Dan’s abominable cookery, I should lose my appetite,
you know. Dan attended Dr. Chorpenning’s funeral yesterday, and he felt
as though he ought to wear a white shirt–and we had a jolly good time
finding such an article. We turned over all our traps, and he found one
at last–but I shall always think it was suffering from yellow fever. He
also found an old black coat, greasy, and wrinkled to that degree that
it appeared to have been quilted at some time or other. In this gorgeous
costume he attended the funeral. And when he returned, his own dog drove
him away from the cabin, not recognizing him. This is true.</p>
<p>You would not like to live in a country where flour was 0 a barrel?
Very well; then, I suppose you would not like to live here, where flour
was 00 a barrel when I first came here. And shortly afterwards, it
couldn’t be had at any price–and for one month the people lived on
barley, beans and beef–and nothing beside. Oh, no–we didn’t luxuriate
then! Perhaps not. But we said wise and severe things about the vanity
and wickedness of high living. We preached our doctrine and practised
it. Which course I respectfully recommend to the clergymen of
St. Louis.</p>
<p>Where is Beack Jolly?–[a pilot]–and Bixby? Your Brother SAM.</p>
