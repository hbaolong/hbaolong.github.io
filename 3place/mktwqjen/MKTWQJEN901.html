1866-67. THE LECTURER. SUCCESS ON THE COAST. IN NEW YORK. THE GREAT
OCEAN EXCURSION</h4>
<p>It was August 13th when he reached San Francisco and wrote in his
note-book, “Home again. No–not home again–in prison again, and all the
wild sense of freedom gone. City seems so cramped and so dreary with
toil and care and business anxieties. God help me, I wish I were at sea
again!“</p>
<p>The transition from the dreamland of a becalmed sailing-vessel to the
dull, cheerless realities of his old life, and the uncertainties of his
future, depressed him–filled him with forebodings. At one moment he felt
himself on the verge of suicide–the world seemed so little worth
while.</p>
<p>He wished to make a trip around the world, a project that required
money. He contemplated making a book of his island letters and
experiences, and the acceptance by Harper’s Magazine of the revised
version of the Hornet Shipwreck story encouraged this thought.</p>
<p>Friends urged him to embody in a lecture the picturesque aspect of
Hawaiian life. The thought frightened him, but it also appealed to him
strongly. He believed he could entertain an audience, once he got
started on the right track. As Governor of the Third House at Carson
City he had kept the audience in hand. Men in whom he had the utmost
confidence insisted that he follow up the lecture idea and engage the
largest house in the city for his purpose. The possibility of failure
appalled him, but he finally agreed to the plan.</p>
<p>In Roughing It, and elsewhere, has been told the story of this
venture–the tale of its splendid success. He was no longer concerned,
now, as to his immediate future. The lecture field was profitable. His
audience laughed and shouted. He was learning the flavor of real success
and exulting in it. With Dennis McCarthy, formerly one of the partners
in the Enterprise, as manager, he made a tour of California and
Nevada.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and others, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>VIRGINIA CITY, Nov. 1, 1866. ALL THE FOLKS, AFFECTIONATE
GREETING,–You know the flush time’s are past, and it has long been
impossible to more than half fill the Theatre here, with any sort of
attraction, but they filled it for me, night before last–full–dollar all
over the house.</p>
<p>I was mighty dubious about Carson, but the enclosed call and some
telegrams set that all right–I lecture there tomorrow night.</p>
<p>They offer a full house and no expense in Dayton–go there next. Sandy
Baldwin says I have made the most sweeping success of any man he knows
of.</p>
<p>I have lectured in San Francisco, Sacramento, Marysville, Grass
Valley, Nevada, You Bet, Red Dog and Virginia. I am going to talk in
Carson, Gold Hill, Silver City, Dayton, Washoe, San Francisco again, and
again here if I have time to re-hash the lecture.</p>
<p>Then I am bound for New York–lecture on the Steamer, maybe.</p>
<p>I’ll leave toward 1st December–but I’ll telegraph you. Love to all.
Yrs. MARK.</p>
<p>His lecture tour continued from October until December, a period of
picturesque incident, the story of which has been recorded elsewhere.
–[See Mark Twain: A Biography, by the same author]–It paid him well; he
could go home now, without shame. Indeed, from his next letter, full of
the boyish elation which always to his last years was the complement of
his success, we gather that he is going home with special honors
–introductions from ministers and the like to distinguished personages
of the East.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>SAN F., Dec. 4, 1866. MY DEAR FOLKS,–I have written to Annie and
Sammy and Katie some time ago–also, to the balance of you.</p>
<p>I called on Rev. Dr. Wadsworth last night with the City College man,
but he wasn’t at home. I was sorry, because I wanted to make his
acquaintance. I am thick as thieves with the Rev. Stebbings, and I am
laying for the Rev. Scudder and the Rev. Dr. Stone. I am running on
preachers, now, altogether. I find them gay. Stebbings is a regular
brick. I am taking letters of introduction to Henry Ward Beecher,
Rev. Dr. Tyng, and other eminent parsons in the east. Whenever anybody
offers me a letter to a preacher, now I snaffle it on the spot. I shall
make Rev. Dr. Bellows trot out the fast nags of the cloth for me when I
get to New York. Bellows is an able, upright and eloquent man–a man of
imperial intellect and matchless power–he is Christian in the truest
sense of the term and is unquestionably a brick….</p>
<p>Gen. Drum has arrived in Philadelphia and established his
head-quarters there, as Adjutant Genl. to Maj. Gen. Meade. Col. Leonard
has received a letter from him in which he offers me a complimentary
benefit if I will come there. I am much obliged, really, but I am afraid
I shan’t lecture much in the States.</p>
<p>The China Mail Steamer is getting ready and everybody says I am
throwing away a fortune in not going in her. I firmly believe it
myself.</p>
<p>I sail for the States in the Opposition steamer of the 5th inst.,
positively and without reserve. My room is already secured for me, and
is the choicest in the ship. I know all the officers.</p>
<p>Yrs. Affy MARK.</p>
<p>We get no hint of his plans, and perhaps he had none. If his purpose
was to lecture in the East, he was in no hurry to begin. Arriving in New
York, after an adventurous voyage, he met a number of old
Californians–men who believed in him–and urged him to lecture. He also
received offers of newspaper engagements, and from Charles Henry Webb,
who had published the Californian, which Bret Harte had edited, came the
proposal to collect his published sketches, including the jumping Frog
story, in book form. Webb himself was in New York, and offered the
sketches to several publishers, including Canton, who had once refused
the Frog story by omitting it from Artemus Ward’s book. It seems curious
that Canton should make a second mistake and refuse it again, but
publishers were wary in those days, and even the newspaper success of
the Frog story did not tempt him to venture it as the title tale of a
book. Webb finally declared he would publish the book himself, and
Clemens, after a few weeks of New York, joined his mother and family in
St. Louis and gave himself up to a considerable period of visiting,
lecturing meantime in both Hannibal and Keokuk.</p>
<p>Fate had great matters in preparation for him. The Quaker City
Mediterranean excursion, the first great ocean picnic, was announced
that spring, and Mark Twain realized that it offered a possible
opportunity for him to see something of the world. He wrote at once to
the proprietors of the Alta-California and proposed that they send him
as their correspondent. To his delight his proposition was accepted, the
Alta agreeing to the twelve hundred dollars passage money, and twenty
dollars each for letters.</p>
<p>The Quaker City was not to sail until the 8th of June, but the Alta
wished some preliminary letters from New York. Furthermore, Webb had the
Frog book in press, and would issue it May 1st. Clemens, therefore,
returned to New York in April, and now once more being urged by the
Californians to lecture, he did not refuse. Frank Fuller, formerly
Governor of Utah, took the matter in hand and engaged Cooper Union for
the venture. He timed it for May 6th, which would be a few days after
the appearance of Webb’s book. Clemens was even more frightened at the
prospect of this lecture than he had been in San Francisco, and with
more reason, for in New York his friends were not many, and competition
for public favor was very great. There are two letters written May 1st,
one to his people, and one to Bret Harte, in San Francisco; that give us
the situation.</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN’S LETTERS 1867-1875</p>
<p>ARRANGED WITH COMMENT BY ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE</p>
<p>VOLUME II.</p>
<p>To Bret Harte, in San Francisco:</p>
<p>WESTMINSTER HOTEL, May 1, 1867. DEAR BRET,–I take my pen in hand to
inform you that I am well and hope these few lines will find you
enjoying the same God’s blessing.</p>
<p>The book is out, and is handsome. It is full of damnable errors of
grammar and deadly inconsistencies of spelling in the Frog sketch
because I was away and did not read the proofs; but be a friend and say
nothing about these things. When my hurry is over, I will send you an
autograph copy to pisen the children with.</p>
<p>I am to lecture in Cooper Institute next Monday night. Pray for
me.</p>
<p>We sail for the Holy Land June 8. Try to write me (to this hotel,)
and it will be forwarded to Paris, where we remain 10 or 15 days.</p>
<p>Regards and best wishes to Mrs. Bret and the family. Truly Yr Friend
MARK.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>WESTMINSTER HOTEL, May 1, 1867. DEAR FOLKS,–Don’t expect me to write
for a while. My hands are full of business on account of my lecture for
the 6th inst., and everything looks shady, at least, if not dark. I have
got a good agent–but now after we have hired Cooper Institute and gone
to an expense in one way or another of 00, it comes out that I have got
to play against Speaker Colfax at Irving Hall, Ristori, and also the
double troupe of Japanese jugglers, the latter opening at the great
Academy of Music–and with all this against me I have taken the largest
house in New York and cannot back water. Let her slide! If nobody else
cares I don’t.</p>
<p>I’ll send the book soon. I am awfully hurried now, but not worried.
Yrs. SAM.</p>
<p>The Cooper Union lecture proved a failure, and a success. When it
became evident to Fuller that the venture was not going to pay, he sent
out a flood of complimentaries to the school-teachers of New York City
and the surrounding districts. No one seems to have declined them.
Clemens lectured to a jammed house and acquired much reputation. Lecture
proposals came from several directions, but he could not accept them
now. He wrote home that he was eighteen Alta letters behind and had
refused everything. Thos. Nast, the cartoonist, then in his first fame,
propped a joint tour, Clemens to lecture while he, Nast, would
illustrate with “lightning“ sketches; but even this could not be
considered now. In a little while he would sail, and the days were
overfull. A letter written a week before he sailed is full of the hurry
and strain of these last days.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>WESTMINSTER HOTEL, NEW YORK, June 1, 1867. DEAR FOLKS,–I know I ought
to write oftener (just got your last,) and more fully, but I cannot
overcome my repugnance to telling what I am doing or what I expect to do
or propose to do. Then, what have I left to write about? Manifestly
nothing.</p>
<p>It isn’t any use for me to talk about the voyage, because I can have
no faith in that voyage till the ship is under way. How do I know she
will ever sail? My passage is paid, and if the ship sails, I sail in
her–but I make no calculations, have bought no cigars, no sea-going
clothing –have made no preparation whatever–shall not pack my trunk till
the morning we sail. Yet my hands are full of what I am going to do the
day before we sail–and what isn’t done that day will go undone.</p>
<p>All I do know or feel, is, that I am wild with impatience to
move–move –move! Half a dozen times I have wished I had sailed long ago
in some ship that wasn’t going to keep me chained here to chafe for
lagging ages while she got ready to go. Curse the endless delays! They
always kill me–they make me neglect every duty and then I have a
conscience that tears me like a wild beast. I wish I never had to stop
anywhere a month. I do more mean things, the moment I get a chance to
fold my hands and sit down than ever I can get forgiveness for.</p>
<p>Yes, we are to meet at Mr. Beach’s next Thursday night, and I suppose
we shall have to be gotten up regardless of expense, in swallow-tails,
white kids and everything en regle.</p>
<p>I am resigned to Rev. Mr. Hutchinson’s or anybody else’s supervision.
I don’t mind it. I am fixed. I have got a splendid, immoral,
tobacco-smoking, wine-drinking, godless room-mate who is as good and
true and right-minded a man as ever lived–a man whose blameless conduct
and example will always be an eloquent sermon to all who shall come
within their influence. But send on the professional preachers–there are
none I like better to converse with. If they’re not narrow minded and
bigoted they make good companions.</p>
<p>I asked them to send the N. Y. Weekly to you–no charge. I am not
going to write for it. Like all other, papers that pay one splendidly it
circulates among stupid people and the ‘canaille.’ I have made no
arrangement with any New York paper–I will see about that Monday or
Tuesday. Love to all Good bye, Yrs affy SAM.</p>
<p>The “immoral“ room-mate whose conduct was to be an “eloquent example“
was Dan Slote, immortalized in the Innocents as “Dan“ –a favorite on the
ship, and later beloved by countless readers.</p>
<p>There is one more letter, written the night before the Quaker City
sailed-a letter which in a sense marks the close of the first great
period of his life–the period of aimless wandering–adventure –youth.</p>
<p>Perhaps a paragraph of explanation should precede this letter.
Political changes had eliminated Orion in Nevada, and he was now
undertaking the practice of law. “Bill Stewart“ was Senator Stewart, of
Nevada, of whom we shall hear again. The “Sandwich Island book,“ as may
be imagined, was made up of his letters to the Sacramento Union. Nothing
came of the venture, except some chapters in ‘Roughing It’, rewritten
from the material. “Zeb and John Leavenworth“ were pilots whom he had
known on the river.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family in St. Louis:</p>
<p>NEW YORK, June 7th, 1867. DEAR FOLKS, I suppose we shall be many a
league at sea tomorrow night, and goodness knows I shall be unspeakably
glad of it.</p>
<p>I haven’t got anything to write, else I would write it. I have just
written myself clear out in letters to the Alta, and I think they are
the stupidest letters that were ever written from New York.
Corresponding has been a perfect drag ever since I got to the states. If
it continues abroad, I don’t know what the Tribune and Alta folks will
think. I have withdrawn the Sandwich Island book–it would be useless to
publish it in these dull publishing times. As for the Frog book, I don’t
believe that will ever pay anything worth a cent. I published it simply
to advertise myself–not with the hope of making anything out of it.</p>
<p>Well, I haven’t anything to write, except that I am tired of staying
in one place–that I am in a fever to get away. Read my Alta letters–they
contain everything I could possibly write to you. Tell Zeb and John
Leavenworth to write me. They can get plenty of gossip from the
pilots.</p>
<p>An importing house sent two cases of exquisite champagne aboard the
ship for me today–Veuve Clicquot and Lac d’Or. I and my room-mate have
set apart every Saturday as a solemn fast day, wherein we will entertain
no light matters of frivolous conversation, but only get drunk. (That is
a joke.) His mother and sisters are the best and most homelike people I
have yet found in a brown stone front. There is no style about them,
except in house and furniture.</p>
<p>I wish Orion were going on this voyage, for I believe he could not
help but be cheerful and jolly. I often wonder if his law business is
going satisfactorily to him, but knowing that the dull season is setting
in now (it looked like it had already set in before) I have felt as if I
could almost answer the question myself–which is to say in plain words,
I was afraid to ask. I wish I had gone to Washington in the winter
instead of going West. I could have gouged an office out of Bill Stewart
for him, and that would atone for the loss of my home visit. But I am so
worthless that it seems to me I never do anything or accomplish anything
that lingers in my mind as a pleasant memory. My mind is stored full of
unworthy conduct toward Orion and towards you all, and an accusing
conscience gives me peace only in excitement and restless moving from
place to place. If I could say I had done one thing for any of you that
entitled me to your good opinion, (I say nothing of your love, for I am
sure of that, no matter how unworthy of it I may make myself, from Orion
down you have always given me that, all the days of my life, when God
Almighty knows I seldom deserve it,) I believe I could go home and stay
there and I know I would care little for the world’s praise or blame.
There is no satisfaction in the world’s praise anyhow, and it has no
worth to me save in the way of business. I tried to gather up its
compliments to send to you, but the work was distasteful and I dropped
it.</p>
<p>You observe that under a cheerful exterior I have got a spirit that
is angry with me and gives me freely its contempt. I can get away from
that at sea, and be tranquil and satisfied–and so, with my parting love
and benediction for Orion and all of you, I say goodbye and God bless
you all–and welcome the wind that wafts a weary soul to the sunny lands
of the Mediterranean! Yrs. Forever, SAM.</p>
