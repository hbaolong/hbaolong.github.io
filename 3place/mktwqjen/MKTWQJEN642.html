<h4 id="fifty-experts-against-a-novice">5 Fifty Experts Against a
Novice</h4>
<p>I GIVE you my honor now that I am not going to distort or discolor
the facts of this miserable trial. No, I will give them to you honestly,
detail by detail, just as Manchon and I set them down daily in the
official record of the court, and just as one may read them in the
printed histories.</p>
<p>There will be only this difference: that in talking familiarly with
you shall use my right to comment upon the proceedings and explain them
as I go along, so that you can understand them better; also, I shall
throw in trifles which came under our eyes and have a certain interest
for you and me, but were not important enough to go into the official
record. [1] To take up my story now where I left off. We heard the
clanking of Joan’s chains down the corridors; she was approaching.</p>
<p>Presently she appeared; a thrill swept the house, and one heard deep
breaths drawn. Two guardsmen followed her at a short distance to the
rear. Her head was bowed a little, and she moved slowly, she being weak
and her irons heavy. She had on men’s attire–all black; a soft woolen
stuff, intensely black, funereally black, not a speck of relieving color
in it from her throat to the floor. A wide collar of this same black
stuff lay in radiating folds upon her shoulders and breast; the sleeves
of her doublet were full, down to the elbows, and tight thence to her
manacled wrists; below the doublet, tight black hose down to the chains
on her ankles.</p>
<p>Half-way to her bench she stopped, just where a wide shaft of light
fell slanting from a window, and slowly lifted her face. Another
thrill!–it was totally colorless, white as snow; a face of gleaming snow
set in vivid contrast upon that slender statue of somber unmitigated
black. It was smooth and pure and girlish, beautiful beyond belief,
infinitely sad and sweet. But, dear, dear! when the challenge of those
untamed eyes fell upon that judge, and the droop vanished from her form
and it straightened up soldierly and noble, my heart leaped for joy; and
I said, all is well, all is well–they have not broken her, they have not
conquered her, she is Joan of Arc still! Yes, it was plain to me now
that there was one spirit there which this dreaded judge could not quell
nor make afraid.</p>
<p>She moved to her place and mounted the dais and seated herself upon
her bench, gathering her chains into her lap and nestling her little
white hands there. Then she waited in tranquil dignity, the only person
there who seemed unmoved and unexcited. A bronzed and brawny English
soldier, standing at martial ease in the front rank of the citizen
spectators, did now most gallantly and respectfully put up his great
hand and give her the military salute; and she, smiling friendly, put up
hers and returned it; whereat there was a sympathetic little break of
applause, which the judge sternly silence.</p>
<p>Now the memorable inquisition called in history the Great Trial
began. Fifty experts against a novice, and no one to help the
novice!</p>
<p>The judge summarized the circumstances of the case and the public
reports and suspicions upon which it was based; then he required Joan to
kneel and make oath that she would answer with exact truthfulness to all
questions asked her.</p>
<p>Joan’s mind was not asleep. It suspected that dangerous possibilities
might lie hidden under this apparently fair and reasonable demand. She
answered with the simplicity which so often spoiled the enemy’s
best-laid plans in the trial at Poitiers, and said:</p>
<p>“No; for I do not know what you are going to ask me; you might ask of
me things which I would not tell you.“</p>
<p>This incensed the Court, and brought out a brisk flurry of angry
exclamations. Joan was not disturbed. Cauchon raised his voice and began
to speak in the midst of this noise, but he was so angry that he could
hardly get his words out. He said:</p>
<p>“With the divine assistance of our Lord we require you to expedite
these proceedings for the welfare of your conscience. Swear, with your
hands upon the Gospels, that you will answer true to the questions which
shall be asked you!“ and he brought down his fat hand with a crash upon
his official table.</p>
<p>Joan said, with composure:</p>
<p>“As concerning my father and mother, and the faith, and what things I
have done since my coming into France, I will gladly answer; but as
regards the revelations which I have received from God, my Voices have
forbidden me to confide them to any save my King–“</p>
<p>Here there was another angry outburst of threats and expletives, and
much movement and confusion; so she had to stop, and wait for the noise
to subside; then her waxen face flushed a little and she straightened up
and fixed her eye on the judge, and finished her sentence in a voice
that had the old ring to it:</p>
<p>–“and I will never reveal these things though you cut my head
off!“</p>
<p>Well, maybe you know what a deliberative body of Frenchmen is like.
The judge and half the court were on their feet in a moment, and all
shaking their fists at the prisoner, and all storming and vituperating
at once, so that you could hardly hear yourself think. They kept this up
several minutes; and because Joan sat untroubled and indifferent they
grew madder and noisier all the time. Once she said, with a fleeting
trace of the old-time mischief in her eye and manner:</p>
<p>“Prithee, speak one at a time, fair lords, then I will answer all of
you.“</p>
<p>At the end of three whole hours of furious debating over the oath,
the situation had not changed a jot. The Bishop was still requiring an
unmodified oath, Joan was refusing for the twentieth time to take any
except the one which she had herself proposed. There was a physical
change apparent, but it was confined to the court and judge; they were
hoarse, droopy, exhausted by their long frenzy, and had a sort of
haggard look in their faces, poor men, whereas Joan was still placid and
reposeful and did not seem noticeably tired.</p>
<p>The noise quieted down; there was a waiting pause of some moments’
duration. Then the judge surrendered to the prisoner, and with
bitterness in his voice told her to take the oath after her own fashion.
Joan sunk at once to her knees; and as she laid her hands upon the
Gospels, that big English soldier set free his mind:</p>
<p>“By God, if she were but English, she were not in this place another
half a second!“</p>
<p>It was the soldier in him responding to the soldier in her. But what
a stinging rebuke it was, what an arraignment of French character and
French royalty! Would that he could have uttered just that one phrase in
the hearing of Orleans! I know that that grateful city, that adoring
city, would have risen to the last man and the last woman, and marched
upon Rouen. Some speeches–speeches that shame a man and humble him–burn
themselves into the memory and remain there. That one is burned into
mine.</p>
<p>After Joan had made oath, Cauchon asked her her name, and where she
was born, and some questions about her family; also what her age was.
She answered these. Then he asked her how much education she had.</p>
<p>“I have learned from my mother the Pater Noster, the Ave Maria, and
the Belief. All that I know was taught me by my mother.“</p>
<p>Questions of this unessential sort dribbled on for a considerable
time. Everybody was tired out by now, except Joan. The tribunal prepared
to rise. At this point Cauchon forbade Joan to try to escape from
prison, upon pain of being held guilty of the crime of heresy–singular
logic! She answered simply:</p>
<p>“I am not bound by this proposition. If I could escape I would not
reproach myself, for I have given no promise, and I shall not.“</p>
<p>Then she complained of the burden of her chains, and asked that they
might be removed, for she was strongly guarded in that dungeon and there
was no need of them. But the Bishop refused, and reminded her that she
had broken out of prison twice before. Joan of Arc was too proud to
insist. She only said, as she rose to go with the guard:</p>
<p>“It is true, I have wanted to escape, and I do want to escape.“ Then
she added, in a way that would touch the pity of anybody, I think, “It
is the right of every prisoner.“</p>
<p>And so she went from the place in the midst of an impressive
stillness, which made the sharper and more distressful to me the clank
of those pathetic chains.</p>
<p>What presence of mind she had! One could never surprise her out of
it. She saw Noel and me there when she first took her seat on the bench,
and we flushed to the forehead with excitement and emotion, but her face
showed nothing, betrayed nothing. Her eyes sought us fifty times that
day, but they passed on and there was never any ray of recognition in
them. Another would have started upon seeing us, and then–why, then
there could have been trouble for us, of course.</p>
<p>We walked slowly home together, each busy with his own grief and
saying not a word.</p>
<p>[1] He kept his word. His account of the Great Trial will be found to
be in strict and detailed accordance with the sworn facts of history.
