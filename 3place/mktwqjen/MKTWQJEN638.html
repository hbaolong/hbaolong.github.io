<h4 id="the-maid-in-chains">1 The Maid in Chains</h4>
<p>I CANNOT bear to dwell at great length upon the shameful history of
the summer and winter following the capture. For a while I was not much
troubled, for I was expecting every day to hear that Joan had been put
to ransom, and that the King–no, not the King, but grateful France–had
come eagerly forward to pay it. By the laws of war she could not be
denied the privilege of ransom. She was not a rebel; she was a
legitimately constituted soldier, head of the armies of France by her
King’s appointment, and guilty of no crime known to military law;
therefore she could not be detained upon any pretext, if ransom were
proffered.</p>
<p>But day after day dragged by and no ransom was offered! It seems
incredible, but it is true. Was that reptile Tremouille busy at the
King’s ear? All we know is, that the King was silent, and made no offer
and no effort in behalf of this poor girl who had done so much for
him.</p>
<p>But, unhappily, there was alacrity enough in another quarter. The
news of the capture reached Paris the day after it happened, and the
glad English and Burgundians deafened the world all the day and all the
night with the clamor of their joy-bells and the thankful thunder of
their artillery, and the next day the Vicar-General of the Inquisition
sent a message to the Duke of Burgundy requiring the delivery of the
prisoner into the hands of the Church to be tried as an idolater.</p>
<p>The English had seen their opportunity, and it was the English power
that was really acting, not the Church. The Church was being used as a
blind, a disguise; and for a forcible reason: the Church was not only
able to take the life of Joan of Arc, but to blight her influence and
the valor-breeding inspiration of her name, whereas the English power
could but kill her body; that would not diminish or destroy the
influence of her name; it would magnify it and make it permanent. Joan
of Arc was the only power in France that the English did not despise,
the only power in France that they considered formidable. If the Church
could be brought to take her life, or to proclaim her an idolater, a
heretic, a witch, sent from Satan, not from heaven, it was believed that
the English supremacy could be at once reinstated.</p>
<p>The Duke of Burgundy listened–but waited. He could not doubt that the
French King or the French people would come forward presently and pay a
higher price than the English. He kept Joan a close prisoner in a strong
fortress, and continued to wait, week after week. He was a French
prince, and was at heart ashamed to sell her to the English. Yet with
all his waiting no offer came to him from the French side.</p>
<p>One day Joan played a cunning truck on her jailer, and not only
slipped out of her prison, but locked him up in it. But as she fled away
she was seen by a sentinel, and was caught and brought back.</p>
<p>Then she was sent to Beaurevoir, a stronger castle. This was early in
August, and she had been in captivity more than two months now. Here she
was shut up in the top of a tower which was sixty feet high. She ate her
heart there for another long stretch–about three months and a half. And
she was aware, all these weary five months of captivity, that the
English, under cover of the Church, were dickering for her as one would
dicker for a horse or a slave, and that France was silent, the King
silent, all her friends the same. Yes, it was pitiful.</p>
<p>And yet when she heard at last that Compiegne was being closely
besieged and likely to be captured, and that the enemy had declared that
no inhabitant of it should escape massacre, not even children of seven
years of age, she was in a fever at once to fly to our rescue. So she
tore her bedclothes to strips and tied them together and descended this
frail rope in the night, and it broke, and she fell and was badly
bruised, and remained three days insensible, meantime neither eating nor
drinking.</p>
<p>And now came relief to us, led by the Count of Vend“me, and Compiegne
was saved and the siege raised. This was a disaster to the Duke of
Burgundy. He had to save money now. It was a good time for a new bid to
be made for Joan of Arc. The English at once sent a French bishop–that
forever infamous Pierre Cauchon of Beauvais. He was partly promised the
Archbishopric of Rouen, which was vacant, if he should succeed. He
claimed the right to preside over Joan’s ecclesiastical trial because
the battle-ground where she was taken was within his diocese. By the
military usage of the time the ransom of a royal prince was 10,000
livres of gold, which is 61,125 francs–a fixed sum, you see. It must be
accepted when offered; it could not be refused.</p>
<p>Cauchon brought the offer of this very sum from the English–a royal
prince’s ransom for the poor little peasant-girl of Domremy. It shows in
a striking way the English idea of her formidable importance. It was
accepted. For that sum Joan of Arc, the Savior of France, was sold; sold
to her enemies; to the enemies of her country; enemies who had lashed
and thrashed and thumped and trounced France for a century and made
holiday sport of it; enemies who had forgotten, years and years ago,
what a Frenchman’s face was like, so used were they to seeing nothing
but his back; enemies whom she had whipped, whom she had cowed, whom she
had taught to respect French valor, new-born in her nation by the breath
of her spirit; enemies who hungered for her life as being the only
puissance able to stand between English triumph and French degradation.
Sold to a French priest by a French prince, with the French King and the
French nation standing thankless by and saying nothing.</p>
<p>And she–what did she say? Nothing. Not a reproach passed her lips.
She was too great for that–she was Joan of Arc; and when that is said,
all is said.</p>
<p>As a soldier, her record was spotless. She could not be called to
account for anything under that head. A subterfuge must be found, and,
as we have seen, was found. She must be tried by priests for crimes
against religion. If none could be discovered, some must be invented.
Let the miscreant Cauchon alone to contrive those.</p>
<p>Rouen was chosen as the scene of the trial. It was in the heart of
the English power; its population had been under English dominion so
many generations that they were hardly French now, save in language. The
place was strongly garrisoned. Joan was taken there near the end of
December, 1430, and flung into a dungeon. Yes, and clothed in chains,
that free spirit!</p>
<p>Still France made no move. How do I account for this? I think there
is only one way. You will remember that whenever Joan was not at the
front, the French held back and ventured nothing; that whenever she led,
they swept everything before them, so long as they could see her white
armor or her banner; that every time she fell wounded or was reported
killed–as at Compiegne–they broke in panic and fled like sheep. I argue
from this that they had undergone no real transformation as yet; that at
bottom they were still under the spell of a timorousness born of
generations of unsuccess, and a lack of confidence in each other and in
their leaders born of old and bitter experience in the way of
treacheries of all sorts–for their kings had been treacherous to their
great vassals and to their generals, and these in turn were treacherous
to the head of the state and to each other. The soldiery found that they
could depend utterly on Joan, and upon her alone. With her gone,
everything was gone. She was the sun that melted the frozen torrents and
set them boiling; with that sun removed, they froze again, and the army
and all France became what they had been before, mere dead corpses–that
and nothing more; incapable of thought, hope, ambition, or motion.</p>
