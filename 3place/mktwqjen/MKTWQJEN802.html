<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>Five weeks drifted tediously along. The SAGAMORE arrived regularly on
the Saturdays, but never once contained a mention of Tilbury Foster.
Sally’s patience broke down at this point, and he said, resentfully:</p>
<p>“Damn his livers, he’s immortal!“</p>
<p>Aleck give him a very severe rebuke, and added with icy
solemnity:</p>
<p>“How would you feel if you were suddenly cut out just after such an
awful remark had escaped out of you?“</p>
<p>Without sufficient reflection Sally responded:</p>
<p>“I’d feel I was lucky I hadn’t got caught with it IN me.“</p>
<p>Pride had forced him to say something, and as he could not think of
any rational thing to say he flung that out. Then he stole a base –as he
called it–that is, slipped from the presence, to keep from being brayed
in his wife’s discussion-mortar.</p>
<p>Six months came and went. The SAGAMORE was still silent about
Tilbury. Meantime, Sally had several times thrown out a feeler–that is,
a hint that he would like to know. Aleck had ignored the hints. Sally
now resolved to brace up and risk a frontal attack. So he squarely
proposed to disguise himself and go to Tilbury’s village and
surreptitiously find out as to the prospects. Aleck put her foot on the
dangerous project with energy and decision. She said:</p>
<p>“What can you be thinking of? You do keep my hands full! You have to
be watched all the time, like a little child, to keep you from walking
into the fire. You’ll stay right where you are!“</p>
<p>“Why, Aleck, I could do it and not be found out–I’m certain of
it.“</p>
<p>“Sally Foster, don’t you know you would have to inquire around?“</p>
<p>“Of course, but what of it? Nobody would suspect who I was.“</p>
<p>“Oh, listen to the man! Some day you’ve got to prove to the executors
that you never inquired. What then?“</p>
<p>He had forgotten that detail. He didn’t reply; there wasn’t anything
to say. Aleck added:</p>
<p>“Now then, drop that notion out of your mind, and don’t ever meddle
with it again. Tilbury set that trap for you. Don’t you know it’s a
trap? He is on the watch, and fully expecting you to blunder into it.
Well, he is going to be disappointed–at least while I am on deck.
Sally!“</p>
<p>“Well?“</p>
<p>“As long as you live, if it’s a hundred years, don’t you ever make an
inquiry. Promise!“</p>
<p>“All right,“ with a sigh and reluctantly.</p>
<p>Then Aleck softened and said:</p>
<p>“Don’t be impatient. We are prospering; we can wait; there is no
hurry. Our small dead-certain income increases all the time; and as to
futures, I have not made a mistake yet–they are piling up by the
thousands and tens of thousands. There is not another family in the
state with such prospects as ours. Already we are beginning to roll in
eventual wealth. You know that, don’t you?“</p>
<p>“Yes, Aleck, it’s certainly so.“</p>
<p>“Then be grateful for what God is doing for us and stop worrying. You
do not believe we could have achieved these prodigious results without
His special help and guidance, do you?“</p>
<p>Hesitatingly, “N-no, I suppose not.“ Then, with feeling and
admiration, “And yet, when it comes to judiciousness in watering a stock
or putting up a hand to skin Wall Street I don’t give in that YOU need
any outside amateur help, if I do wish I–“</p>
<p>“Oh, DO shut up! I know you do not mean any harm or any irreverence,
poor boy, but you can’t seem to open your mouth without letting out
things to make a person shudder. You keep me in constant dread. For you
and for all of us. Once I had no fear of the thunder, but now when I
hear it I–“</p>
<p>Her voice broke, and she began to cry, and could not finish. The
sight of this smote Sally to the heart and he took her in his arms and
petted her and comforted her and promised better conduct, and upbraided
himself and remorsefully pleaded for forgiveness. And he was in earnest,
and sorry for what he had done and ready for any sacrifice that could
make up for it.</p>
<p>And so, in privacy, he thought long and deeply over the matter,
resolving to do what should seem best. It was easy to PROMISE reform;
indeed he had already promised it. But would that do any real good, any
permanent good? No, it would be but temporary–he knew his weakness, and
confessed it to himself with sorrow–he could not keep the promise.
Something surer and better must be devised; and he devised it. At cost
of precious money which he had long been saving up, shilling by
shilling, he put a lightning-rod on the house.</p>
<p>At a subsequent time he relapsed.</p>
<p>What miracles habit can do! and how quickly and how easily habits are
acquired–both trifling habits and habits which profoundly change us. If
by accident we wake at two in the morning a couple of nights in
succession, we have need to be uneasy, for another repetition can turn
the accident into a habit; and a month’s dallying with whiskey –but we
all know these commonplace facts.</p>
<p>The castle-building habit, the day-dreaming habit–how it grows! what
a luxury it becomes; how we fly to its enchantments at every idle
moment, how we revel in them, steep our souls in them, intoxicate
ourselves with their beguiling fantasies–oh yes, and how soon and how
easily our dream life and our material life become so intermingled and
so fused together that we can’t quite tell which is which, any more.</p>
<p>By and by Aleck subscribed to a Chicago daily and for the WALL STREET
POINTER. With an eye single to finance she studied these as diligently
all the week as she studied her Bible Sundays. Sally was lost in
admiration, to note with what swift and sure strides her genius and
judgment developed and expanded in the forecasting and handling of the
securities of both the material and spiritual markets. He was proud of
her nerve and daring in exploiting worldly stocks, and just as proud of
her conservative caution in working her spiritual deals. He noted that
she never lost her head in either case; that with a splendid courage she
often went short on worldly futures, but heedfully drew the line
there–she was always long on the others. Her policy was quite sane and
simple, as she explained it to him: what she put into earthly futures
was for speculation, what she put into spiritual futures was for
investment; she was willing to go into the one on a margin, and take
chances, but in the case of the other, “margin her no margins“–she
wanted to cash in a hundred cents per dollar’s worth, and have the stock
transferred on the books.</p>
<p>It took but a very few months to educate Aleck’s imagination and
Sally’s. Each day’s training added something to the spread and
effectiveness of the two machines. As a consequence, Aleck made
imaginary money much faster than at first she had dreamed of making it,
and Sally’s competency in spending the overflow of it kept pace with the
strain put upon it, right along. In the beginning, Aleck had given the
coal speculation a twelvemonth in which to materialize, and had been
loath to grant that this term might possibly be shortened by nine
months. But that was the feeble work, the nursery work, of a financial
fancy that had had no teaching, no experience, no practice. These aids
soon came, then that nine months vanished, and the imaginary
ten-thousand-dollar investment came marching home with three hundred per
cent. profit on its back!</p>
<p>It was a great day for the pair of Fosters. They were speechless for
joy. Also speechless for another reason: after much watching of the
market, Aleck had lately, with fear and trembling, made her first flyer
on a “margin,“ using the remaining twenty thousand of the bequest in
this risk. In her mind’s eye she had seen it climb, point by
point–always with a chance that the market would break –until at last
her anxieties were too great for further endurance –she being new to the
margin business and unhardened, as yet–and she gave her imaginary broker
an imaginary order by imaginary telegraph to sell. She said forty
thousand dollars’ profit was enough. The sale was made on the very day
that the coal venture had returned with its rich freight. As I have
said, the couple were speechless. they sat dazed and blissful that
night, trying to realize that they were actually worth a hundred
thousand dollars in clean, imaginary cash. Yet so it was.</p>
<p>It was the last time that ever Aleck was afraid of a margin; at least
afraid enough to let it break her sleep and pale her cheek to the extent
that this first experience in that line had done.</p>
<p>Indeed it was a memorable night. Gradually the realization that they
were rich sank securely home into the souls of the pair, then they began
to place the money. If we could have looked out through the eyes of
these dreamers, we should have seen their tidy little wooden house
disappear, and two-story brick with a cast-iron fence in front of it
take its place; we should have seen a three-globed gas-chandelier grow
down from the parlor ceiling; we should have seen the homely rag carpet
turn to noble Brussels, a dollar and a half a yard; we should have seen
the plebeian fireplace vanish away and a recherche, big base-burner with
isinglass windows take position and spread awe around. And we should
have seen other things, too; among them the buggy, the lap-robe, the
stove-pipe hat, and so on.</p>
<p>From that time forth, although the daughters and the neighbors saw
only the same old wooden house there, it was a two-story brick to Aleck
and Sally and not a night went by that Aleck did not worry about the
imaginary gas-bills, and get for all comfort Sally’s reckless retort:
“What of it? We can afford it.“</p>
<p>Before the couple went to bed, that first night that they were rich,
they had decided that they must celebrate. They must give a party –that
was the idea. But how to explain it–to the daughters and the neighbors?
They could not expose the fact that they were rich. Sally was willing,
even anxious, to do it; but Aleck kept her head and would not allow it.
She said that although the money was as good as in, it would be as well
to wait until it was actually in. On that policy she took her stand, and
would not budge. The great secret must be kept, she said–kept from the
daughters and everybody else.</p>
<p>The pair were puzzled. They must celebrate, they were determined to
celebrate, but since the secret must be kept, what could they celebrate?
No birthdays were due for three months. Tilbury wasn’t available,
evidently he was going to live forever; what the nation COULD they
celebrate? That was Sally’s way of putting it; and he was getting
impatient, too, and harassed. But at last he hit it–just by sheer
inspiration, as it seemed to him –and all their troubles were gone in a
moment; they would celebrate the Discovery of America. A splendid
idea!</p>
<p>Aleck was almost too proud of Sally for words–she said SHE never
would have thought of it. But Sally, although he was bursting with
delight in the compliment and with wonder at himself, tried not to let
on, and said it wasn’t really anything, anybody could have done it.
Whereat Aleck, with a prideful toss of her happy head, said:</p>
<p>“Oh, certainly! Anybody could–oh, anybody! Hosannah Dilkins, for
instance! Or maybe Adelbert Peanut–oh, DEAR–yes! Well, I’d like to see
them try it, that’s all. Dear-me-suz, if they could think of the
discovery of a forty-acre island it’s more than <em>I</em> believe they
could; and as for the whole continent, why, Sally Foster, you know
perfectly well it would strain the livers and lights out of them and
THEN they couldn’t!“</p>
<p>The dear woman, she knew he had talent; and if affection made her
over-estimate the size of it a little, surely it was a sweet and gentle
crime, and forgivable for its source’s sake.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>The celebration went off well. The friends were all present, both the
young and the old. Among the young were Flossie and Gracie Peanut and
their brother Adelbert, who was a rising young journeyman tinner, also
Hosannah Dilkins, Jr., journeyman plasterer, just out of his
apprenticeship. For many months Adelbert and Hosannah had been showing
interest in Gwendolen and Clytemnestra Foster, and the parents of the
girls had noticed this with private satisfaction. But they suddenly
realized now that that feeling had passed. They recognized that the
changed financial conditions had raised up a social bar between their
daughters and the young mechanics. The daughters could now look
higher–and must. Yes, must. They need marry nothing below the grade of
lawyer or merchant; poppa and momma would take care of this; there must
be no mesalliances.</p>
<p>However, these thinkings and projects of their were private, and did
not show on the surface, and therefore threw no shadow upon the
celebration. What showed upon the surface was a serene and lofty
contentment and a dignity of carriage and gravity of deportment which
compelled the admiration and likewise the wonder of the company. All
noticed it and all commented upon it, but none was able to divine the
secret of it. It was a marvel and a mystery. Three several persons
remarked, without suspecting what clever shots they were making:</p>
<p>“It’s as if they’d come into property.“</p>
<p>That was just it, indeed.</p>
<p>Most mothers would have taken hold of the matrimonial matter in the
old regulation way; they would have given the girls a talking to, of a
solemn sort and untactful–a lecture calculated to defeat its own
purpose, by producing tears and secret rebellion; and the said mothers
would have further damaged the business by requesting the young
mechanics to discontinue their attentions. But this mother was
different. She was practical. She said nothing to any of the young
people concerned, nor to any one else except Sally. He listened to her
and understood; understood and admired. He said:</p>
<p>“I get the idea. Instead of finding fault with the samples on view,
thus hurting feelings and obstructing trade without occasion, you merely
offer a higher class of goods for the money, and leave nature to take
her course. It’s wisdom, Aleck, solid wisdom, and sound as a nut. Who’s
your fish? Have you nominated him yet?“</p>
<p>No, she hadn’t. They must look the market over–which they did. To
start with, they considered and discussed Brandish, rising young lawyer,
and Fulton, rising young dentist. Sally must invite them to dinner. But
not right away; there was no hurry, Aleck said. Keep an eye on the pair,
and wait; nothing would be lost by going slowly in so important a
matter.</p>
<p>It turned out that this was wisdom, too; for inside of three weeks
Aleck made a wonderful strike which swelled her imaginary hundred
thousand to four hundred thousand of the same quality. She and Sally
were in the clouds that evening. For the first time they introduced
champagne at dinner. Not real champagne, but plenty real enough for the
amount of imagination expended on it. It was Sally that did it, and
Aleck weakly submitted. At bottom both were troubled and ashamed, for he
was a high-up Son of Temperance, and at funerals wore an apron which no
dog could look upon and retain his reason and his opinion; and she was a
W. C. T. U., with all that that implies of boiler-iron virtue and
unendurable holiness. But there is was; the pride of riches was
beginning its disintegrating work. They had lived to prove, once more, a
sad truth which had been proven many times before in the world: that
whereas principle is a great and noble protection against showy and
degrading vanities and vices, poverty is worth six of it. More than four
hundred thousand dollars to the good. They took up the matrimonial
matter again. Neither the dentist nor the lawyer was mentioned; there
was no occasion, they were out of the running. Disqualified. They
discussed the son of the pork-packer and the son of the village banker.
But finally, as in the previous case, they concluded to wait and think,
and go cautiously and sure.</p>
<p>Luck came their way again. Aleck, ever watchful saw a great and risky
chance, and took a daring flyer. A time of trembling, of doubt, of awful
uneasiness followed, for non-success meant absolute ruin and nothing
short of it. Then came the result, and Aleck, faint with joy, could
hardly control her voice when she said:</p>
<p>“The suspense is over, Sally–and we are worth a cold million!“</p>
<p>Sally wept for gratitude, and said:</p>
<p>“Oh, Electra, jewel of women, darling of my heart, we are free at
last, we roll in wealth, we need never scrimp again. It’s a case for
Veuve Cliquot!“ and he got out a pint of spruce-beer and made sacrifice,
he saying “Damn the expense,“ and she rebuking him gently with
reproachful but humid and happy eyes.</p>
<p>They shelved the pork-packer’s son and the banker’s son, and sat down
to consider the Governor’s son and the son of the Congressman.</p>
