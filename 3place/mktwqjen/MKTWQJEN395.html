<h4 id="chapter-12-sounding">Chapter 12 Sounding</h4>
<p>WHEN the river is very low, and one’s steamboat is ‘drawing all the
water’ there is in the channel,–or a few inches more, as was often the
case in the old times,–one must be painfully circumspect in his
piloting. We used to have to ‘sound’ a number of particularly bad places
almost every trip when the river was at a very low stage.</p>
<p>Sounding is done in this way. The boat ties up at the shore, just
above the shoal crossing; the pilot not on watch takes his ‘cub’ or
steersman and a picked crew of men (sometimes an officer also), and goes
out in the yawl–provided the boat has not that rare and sumptuous
luxury, a regularly-devised ‘sounding-boat’–and proceeds to hunt for the
best water, the pilot on duty watching his movements through a
spy-glass, meantime, and in some instances assisting by signals of the
boat’s whistle, signifying ‘try higher up’ or ‘try lower down;’ for the
surface of the water, like an oil-painting, is more expressive and
intelligible when inspected from a little distance than very close at
hand. The whistle signals are seldom necessary, however; never, perhaps,
except when the wind confuses the significant ripples upon the water’s
surface. When the yawl has reached the shoal place, the speed is
slackened, the pilot begins to sound the depth with a pole ten or twelve
feet long, and the steersman at the tiller obeys the order to ‘hold her
up to starboard;’ or, ‘let her fall off to larboard;’{footnote [The term
‘larboard’ is never used at sea now, to signify the left hand; but was
always used on the river in my time]} or ‘steady–steady as you go.’</p>
<p>When the measurements indicate that the yawl is approaching the
shoalest part of the reef, the command is given to ‘ease all!’ Then the
men stop rowing and the yawl drifts with the current. The next order is,
‘Stand by with the buoy!’ The moment the shallowest point is reached,
the pilot delivers the order, ‘Let go the buoy!’ and over she goes. If
the pilot is not satisfied, he sounds the place again; if he finds
better water higher up or lower down, he removes the buoy to that place.
Being finally satisfied, he gives the order, and all the men stand their
oars straight up in the air, in line; a blast from the boat’s whistle
indicates that the signal has been seen; then the men ‘give way’ on
their oars and lay the yawl alongside the buoy; the steamer comes
creeping carefully down, is pointed straight at the buoy, husbands her
power for the coming struggle, and presently, at the critical moment,
turns on all her steam and goes grinding and wallowing over the buoy and
the sand, and gains the deep water beyond. Or maybe she doesn’t; maybe
she ‘strikes and swings.’ Then she has to while away several hours (or
days) sparring herself off.</p>
<p>Sometimes a buoy is not laid at all, but the yawl goes ahead, hunting
the best water, and the steamer follows along in its wake. Often there
is a deal of fun and excitement about sounding, especially if it is a
glorious summer day, or a blustering night. But in winter the cold and
the peril take most of the fun out of it.</p>
<p>A buoy is nothing but a board four or five feet long, with one end
turned up; it is a reversed school-house bench, with one of the supports
left and the other removed. It is anchored on the shoalest part of the
reef by a rope with a heavy stone made fast to the end of it. But for
the resistance of the turned-up end of the reversed bench, the current
would pull the buoy under water. At night, a paper lantern with a candle
in it is fastened on top of the buoy, and this can be seen a mile or
more, a little glimmering spark in the waste of blackness.</p>
<p>Nothing delights a cub so much as an opportunity to go out sounding.
There is such an air of adventure about it; often there is danger; it is
so gaudy and man-of-war-like to sit up in the stern-sheets and steer a
swift yawl; there is something fine about the exultant spring of the
boat when an experienced old sailor crew throw their souls into the
oars; it is lovely to see the white foam stream away from the bows;
there is music in the rush of the water; it is deliciously exhilarating,
in summer, to go speeding over the breezy expanses of the river when the
world of wavelets is dancing in the sun. It is such grandeur, too, to
the cub, to get a chance to give an order; for often the pilot will
simply say, ‘Let her go about!’ and leave the rest to the cub, who
instantly cries, in his sternest tone of command, ‘Ease starboard!
Strong on the larboard! Starboard give way! With a will, men!’ The cub
enjoys sounding for the further reason that the eyes of the passengers
are watching all the yawl’s movements with absorbing interest if the
time be daylight; and if it be night he knows that those same wondering
eyes are fastened upon the yawl’s lantern as it glides out into the
gloom and dims away in the remote distance.</p>
<p>One trip a pretty girl of sixteen spent her time in our pilot-house
with her uncle and aunt, every day and all day long. I fell in love with
her. So did Mr. Thornburg’s cub, Tom G—-. Tom and I had been bosom
friends until this time; but now a coolness began to arise. I told the
girl a good many of my river adventures, and made myself out a good deal
of a hero; Tom tried to make himself appear to be a hero, too, and
succeeded to some extent, but then he always had a way of embroidering.
However, virtue is its own reward, so I was a barely perceptible trifle
ahead in the contest. About this time something happened which promised
handsomely for me: the pilots decided to sound the crossing at the head
of 21. This would occur about nine or ten o’clock at night, when the
passengers would be still up; it would be Mr. Thornburg’s watch,
therefore my chief would have to do the sounding. We had a perfect love
of a sounding-boat–long, trim, graceful, and as fleet as a greyhound;
her thwarts were cushioned; she carried twelve oarsmen; one of the mates
was always sent in her to transmit orders to her crew, for ours was a
steamer where no end of ‘style’ was put on.</p>
<p>We tied up at the shore above 21, and got ready. It was a foul night,
and the river was so wide, there, that a landsman’s uneducated eyes
could discern no opposite shore through such a gloom. The passengers
were alert and interested; everything was satisfactory. As I hurried
through the engine-room, picturesquely gotten up in storm toggery, I met
Tom, and could not forbear delivering myself of a mean speech–</p>
<p>‘Ain’t you glad YOU don’t have to go out sounding?’</p>
<p>Tom was passing on, but he quickly turned, and said–</p>
<p>‘Now just for that, you can go and get the sounding-pole yourself. I
was going after it, but I’d see you in Halifax, now, before I’d do
it.’</p>
<p>‘Who wants you to get it? I don’t. It’s in the sounding-boat.’</p>
<p>‘It ain’t, either. It’s been new-painted; and it’s been up on the
ladies’ cabin guards two days, drying.’</p>
<p>I flew back, and shortly arrived among the crowd of watching and
wondering ladies just in time to hear the command:</p>
<p>‘Give way, men!’</p>
<p>I looked over, and there was the gallant sounding-boat booming away,
the unprincipled Tom presiding at the tiller, and my chief sitting by
him with the sounding-pole which I had been sent on a fool’s errand to
fetch. Then that young girl said to me–</p>
<p>‘Oh, how awful to have to go out in that little boat on such a night!
Do you think there is any danger?’</p>
<p>I would rather have been stabbed. I went off, full of venom, to help
in the pilot-house. By and by the boat’s lantern disappeared, and after
an interval a wee spark glimmered upon the face of the water a mile
away. Mr. Thornburg blew the whistle, in acknowledgment, backed the
steamer out, and made for it. We flew along for a while, then slackened
steam and went cautiously gliding toward the spark. Presently
Mr. Thornburg exclaimed–</p>
<p>‘Hello, the buoy-lantern’s out!’</p>
<p>He stopped the engines. A moment or two later he said–</p>
<p>‘Why, there it is again!’</p>
<p>So he came ahead on the engines once more, and rang for the leads.
Gradually the water shoaled up, and then began to deepen again!
Mr. Thornburg muttered–</p>
<p>‘Well, I don’t understand this. I believe that buoy has drifted off
the reef. Seems to be a little too far to the left. No matter, it is
safest to run over it anyhow.’</p>
<p>So, in that solid world of darkness we went creeping down on the
light. Just as our bows were in the act of plowing over it,
Mr. Thornburg seized the bell-ropes, rang a startling peal, and
exclaimed–</p>
<p>‘My soul, it’s the sounding-boat!’</p>
<p>A sudden chorus of wild alarms burst out far below–a pause–and then
the sound of grinding and crashing followed. Mr. Thornburg
exclaimed–</p>
<p>‘There! the paddle-wheel has ground the sounding-boat to lucifer
matches! Run! See who is killed!’</p>
<p>I was on the main deck in the twinkling of an eye. My chief and the
third mate and nearly all the men were safe. They had discovered their
danger when it was too late to pull out of the way; then, when the great
guards overshadowed them a moment later, they were prepared and knew
what to do; at my chiefs order they sprang at the right instant, seized
the guard, and were hauled aboard. The next moment the sounding-yawl
swept aft to the wheel and was struck and splintered to atoms. Two of
the men and the cub Tom, were missing–a fact which spread like wildfire
over the boat. The passengers came flocking to the forward gangway,
ladies and all, anxious-eyed, white-faced, and talked in awed voices of
the dreadful thing. And often and again I heard them say, ‘Poor fellows!
poor boy, poor boy!’</p>
<p>By this time the boat’s yawl was manned and away, to search for the
missing. Now a faint call was heard, off to the left. The yawl had
disappeared in the other direction. Half the people rushed to one side
to encourage the swimmer with their shouts; the other half rushed the
other way to shriek to the yawl to turn about. By the callings, the
swimmer was approaching, but some said the sound showed failing
strength. The crowd massed themselves against the boiler-deck railings,
leaning over and staring into the gloom; and every faint and fainter cry
wrung from them such words as, ‘Ah, poor fellow, poor fellow! is there
no way to save him?’</p>
<p>But still the cries held out, and drew nearer, and presently the
voice said pluckily–</p>
<p>‘I can make it! Stand by with a rope!’</p>
<p>What a rousing cheer they gave him! The chief mate took his stand in
the glare of a torch-basket, a coil of rope in his hand, and his men
grouped about him. The next moment the swimmer’s face appeared in the
circle of light, and in another one the owner of it was hauled aboard,
limp and drenched, while cheer on cheer went up. It was that devil
Tom.</p>
<p>The yawl crew searched everywhere, but found no sign of the two men.
They probably failed to catch the guard, tumbled back, and were struck
by the wheel and killed. Tom had never jumped for the guard at all, but
had plunged head-first into the river and dived under the wheel. It was
nothing; I could have done it easy enough, and I said so; but everybody
went on just the same, making a wonderful to do over that ass, as if he
had done something great. That girl couldn’t seem to have enough of that
pitiful ‘hero’ the rest of the trip; but little I cared; I loathed her,
any way.</p>
<p>The way we came to mistake the sounding-boat’s lantern for the buoy-
light was this. My chief said that after laying the buoy he fell away
and watched it till it seemed to be secure; then he took up a position a
hundred yards below it and a little to one side of the steamer’s course,
headed the sounding-boat up-stream, and waited. Having to wait some
time, he and the officer got to talking; he looked up when he judged
that the steamer was about on the reef; saw that the buoy was gone, but
supposed that the steamer had already run over it; he went on with his
talk; he noticed that the steamer was getting very close on him, but
that was the correct thing; it was her business to shave him closely,
for convenience in taking him aboard; he was expecting her to sheer off,
until the last moment; then it flashed upon him that she was trying to
run him down, mistaking his lantern for the buoy-light; so he sang out,
‘Stand by to spring for the guard, men!’ and the next instant the jump
was made.</p>
