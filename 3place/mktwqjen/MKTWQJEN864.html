<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>Four years ago I wrote the preceding chapters. I was assured by the
wise that Christian Science was a fleeting craze and would soon perish.
This prompt and all-competent stripe of prophet is always to be had in
the market at ground-floor rates. He does not stop to load, or consider,
or take aim, but lets fly just as he stands. Facts are nothing to him,
he has no use for such things; he works wholly by inspiration. And so,
when he is asked why he considers a new movement a passing fad and
quickly perishable, he finds himself unprepared with a reason and is
more or less embarrassed. For a moment. Only for a moment. Then he
waylays the first spectre of a reason that goes flitting through the
desert places of his mind, and is at once serene again and ready for
conflict. Serene and confident. Yet he should not be so, since he has
had no chance to examine his catch, and cannot know whether it is going
to help his contention or damage it.</p>
<p>The impromptu reason furnished by the early prophets of whom I have
spoken was this:</p>
<p>“There is nothing to Christian Science; there is nothing about it
that appeals to the intellect; its market will be restricted to the
unintelligent, the mentally inferior, the people who do not think.“</p>
<p>They called that a reason why the cult would not flourish and endure.
It seems the equivalent of saying:</p>
<p>“There is no money in tinware; there is nothing about it that appeals
to the rich; its market will be restricted to the poor.“</p>
<p>It is like bringing forward the best reason in the world why
Christian Science should flourish and live, and then blandly offering it
as a reason why it should sicken and die.</p>
<p>That reason was furnished me by the complacent and unfrightened
prophets four years ago, and it has been furnished me again to-day. If
conversions to new religions or to old ones were in any considerable
degree achieved through the intellect, the aforesaid reason would be
sound and sufficient, no doubt; the inquirer into Christian Science
might go away unconvinced and unconverted. But we all know that
conversions are seldom made in that way; that such a thing as a serious
and painstaking and fairly competent inquiry into the claims of a
religion or of a political dogma is a rare occurrence; and that the vast
mass of men and women are far from being capable of making such an
examination. They are not capable, for the reason that their minds,
howsoever good they may be, are not trained for such examinations. The
mind not trained for that work is no more competent to do it than are
lawyers and farmers competent to make successful clothes without
learning the tailor’s trade. There are seventy-five million men and
women among us who do not know how to cut out and make a dress-suit, and
they would not think of trying; yet they all think they can competently
think out a political or religious scheme without any apprenticeship to
the business, and many of them believe they have actually worked that
miracle. But, indeed, the truth is, almost all the men and women of our
nation or of any other get their religion and their politics where they
get their astronomy–entirely at second hand. Being untrained, they are
no more able to intelligently examine a dogma or a policy than they are
to calculate an eclipse.</p>
<p>Men are usually competent thinkers along the lines of their
specialized training only. Within these limits alone are their opinions
and judgments valuable; outside of these limits they grope and are lost
–usually without knowing it. In a church assemblage of five hundred
persons, there will be a man or two whose trained minds can seize upon
each detail of a great manufacturing scheme and recognize its value or
its lack of value promptly; and can pass the details in intelligent
review, section by section, and finally as a whole, and then deliver a
verdict upon the scheme which cannot be flippantly set aside nor easily
answered. And there will be one or two other men there who can do the
same thing with a great and complicated educational project; and one or
two others who can do the like with a large scheme for applying
electricity in a new and unheard-of way; and one or two others who can
do it with a showy scheme for revolutionizing the scientific world’s
accepted notions regarding geology. And so on, and so on. But the
manufacturing experts will not be competent to examine the educational
scheme intelligently, and their opinion about it would not be valuable;
neither of these two groups will be able to understand and pass upon the
electrical scheme; none of these three batches of experts will be able
to understand and pass upon the geological revolution; and probably not
one man in the entire lot will be competent to examine, capably, the
intricacies of a political or religious scheme, new or old, and deliver
a judgment upon it which any one need regard as precious.</p>
<p>There you have the top crust. There will be four hundred and
seventy-five men and women present who can draw upon their training and
deliver incontrovertible judgments concerning cheese, and leather, and
cattle, and hardware, and soap, and tar, and candles, and patent
medicines, and dreams, and apparitions, and garden trucks, and cats, and
baby food, and warts, and hymns, and time-tables, and freight-rates, and
summer resorts, and whiskey, and law, and surgery, and dentistry, and
blacksmithing, and shoemaking, and dancing, and Huyler’s candy, and
mathematics, and dog fights, and obstetrics, and music, and sausages,
and dry goods, and molasses, and railroad stocks, and horses, and
literature, and labor unions, and vegetables, and morals, and lamb’s
fries, and etiquette, and agriculture. And not ten among the five
hundred–let their minds be ever so good and bright–will be competent, by
grace of the requisite specialized mental training, to take hold of a
complex abstraction of any kind and make head or tail of it.</p>
<p>The whole five hundred are thinkers, and they are all capable
thinkers –but only within the narrow limits of their specialized
trainings. Four hundred and ninety of them cannot competently examine
either a religious plan or a political one. A scattering few of them do
examine both–that is, they think they do. With results as precious as
when I examine the nebular theory and explain it to myself.</p>
<p>If the four hundred and ninety got their religion through their
minds, and by weighed and measured detail, Christian Science would not
be a scary apparition. But they don’t; they get a little of it through
their minds, more of it through their feelings, and the overwhelming
bulk of it through their environment.</p>
<p>Environment is the chief thing to be considered when one is proposing
to predict the future of Christian Science. It is not the ability to
reason that makes the Presbyterian, or the Baptist, or the Methodist, or
the Catholic, or the Mohammedan, or the Buddhist, or the Mormon; it is
environment. If religions were got by reasoning, we should have the
extraordinary spectacle of an American family with a Presbyterian in it,
and a Baptist, a Methodist, a Catholic, a Mohammedan, a Buddhist, and a
Mormon. A Presbyterian family does not produce Catholic families or
other religious brands, it produces its own kind; and not by
intellectual processes, but by association. And so also with
Mohammedanism, the cult which in our day is spreading with the sweep of
a world-conflagration through the Orient, that native home of profound
thought and of subtle intellectual fence, that fertile womb whence has
sprung every great religion that exists. Including our own; for with all
our brains we cannot invent a religion and market it.</p>
<p>The language of my quoted prophets recurs to us now, and we wonder to
think how small a space in the world the mighty Mohammedan Church would
be occupying now, if a successful trade in its line of goods had been
conditioned upon an exhibit that would “appeal to the intellect“ instead
of to “the unintelligent, the mentally inferior, the people who do not
think.“</p>
<p>The Christian Science Church, like the Mohammedan Church, makes no
embarrassing appeal to the intellect, has no occasion to do it, and can
get along quite well without it.</p>
<p>Provided. Provided what? That it can secure that thing which is worth
two or three hundred thousand times more than an “appeal to the
intellect“–an environment. Can it get that? Will it be a menace to
regular Christianity if it gets that? Is it time for regular
Christianity to get alarmed? Or shall regular Christianity smile a smile
and turn over and take another nap? Won’t it be wise and proper for
regular Christianity to do the old way, Me customary way, the historical
way–lock the stable-door after the horse is gone? Just as Protestantism
has smiled and nodded this long time (while the alert and diligent
Catholic was slipping in and capturing the public schools), and is now
beginning to hunt around for the key when it is too late?</p>
<p>Will Christian Science get a chance to show its wares? It has already
secured that chance. Will it flourish and spread and prosper if it shall
create for itself the one thing essential to those conditions–an
environment? It has already created an environment. There are families
of Christian Scientists in every community in America, and each family
is a factory; each family turns out a Christian Science product at the
customary intervals, and contributes it to the Cause in the only way in
which contributions of recruits to Churches are ever made on a large
scale–by the puissant forces of personal contact and association. Each
family is an agency for the Cause, and makes converts among the
neighbors, and starts some more factories.</p>
<p>Four years ago there were six Christian Scientists in a certain town
that I am acquainted with; a year ago there were two hundred and fifty
there; they have built a church, and its membership now numbers four
hundred. This has all been quietly done; done without frenzied revivals,
without uniforms, brass bands, street parades, corner oratory, or any of
the other customary persuasions to a godly life. Christian Science, like
Mohammedanism, is “restricted“ to the “unintelligent, the people who do
not think.“ There lies the danger. It makes Christian Science
formidable. It is “restricted“ to ninety-nine one-hundredths of the
human race, and must be reckoned with by regular Christianity. And will
be, as soon as it is too late.</p>
<p>BOOK II</p>
<p>“There were remarkable things about the stranger called the Man
–Mystery-things so very extraordinary that they monopolized attention
and made all of him seem extraordinary; but this was not so, the most of
his qualities being of the common, every-day size and like anybody
else’s. It was curious. He was of the ordinary stature, and had the
ordinary aspects; yet in him were hidden such strange contradictions and
disproportions! He was majestically fearless and heroic; he had the
strength of thirty men and the daring of thirty thousand; handling
armies, organizing states, administering governments–these were pastimes
to him; he publicly and ostentatiously accepted the human race at its
own valuation–as demigods–and privately and successfully dealt with it
at quite another and juster valuation–as children and slaves; his
ambitions were stupendous, and his dreams had no commerce with the
humble plain, but moved with the cloud-rack among the snow-summits.
These features of him were, indeed, extraordinary, but the rest of him
was ordinary and usual. He was so mean-minded, in the matter of
jealousy, that it was thought he was descended from a god; he was vain
in little ways, and had a pride in trivialities; he doted on ballads
about moonshine and bruised hearts; in education he was deficient, he
was indifferent to literature, and knew nothing of art; he was dumb upon
all subjects but one, indifferent to all except that one–the Nebular
Theory. Upon that one his flow of words was full and free, he was a
geyser. The official astronomers disputed his facts and deeded his
views, and said that he had invented both, they not being findable in
any of the books. But many of the laity, who wanted their nebulosities
fresh, admired his doctrine and adopted it, and it attained to great
prosperity in spite of the hostility of the experts.“–The Legend of the
Man-Mystery, ch. i.</p>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>JANUARY, 1903. When we do not know a public man personally, we guess
him out by the facts of his career. When it is Washington, we all arrive
at about one and the same result. We agree that his words and his acts
clearly interpret his character to us, and that they never leave us in
doubt as to the motives whence the words and acts proceeded. It is the
same with Joan of Arc, it is the same with two or three or five or six
others among the immortals. But in the matter of motives and of a few
details of character we agree to disagree upon Napoleon, Cromwell, and
all the rest; and to this list we must add Mrs. Eddy. I think we can
peacefully agree as to two or three extraordinary features of her
make-up, but not upon the other features of it. We cannot peacefully
agree as to her motives, therefore her character must remain crooked to
some of us and straight to the others.</p>
<p>No matter, she is interesting enough without an amicable agreement.
In several ways she is the most interesting woman that ever lived, and
the most extraordinary. The same may be said of her career, and the same
may be said of its chief result. She started from nothing. Her enemies
charge that she surreptitiously took from Quimby a peculiar system of
healing which was mind-cure with a Biblical basis. She and her friends
deny that she took anything from him. This is a matter which we can
discuss by-and-by. Whether she took it or invented it, it was
–materially–a sawdust mine when she got it, and she has turned it into a
Klondike; its spiritual dock had next to no custom, if any at all: from
it she has launched a world-religion which has now six hundred and
sixty-three churches, and she charters a new one every four days. When
we do not know a person–and also when we do–we have to judge his size by
the size and nature of his achievements, as compared with the
achievements of others in his special line of business–there is no other
way. Measured by this standard, it is thirteen hundred years since the
world has produced any one who could reach up to Mrs. Eddy’s
waistbelt.</p>
<p>Figuratively speaking, Mrs. Eddy is already as tall as the Eiffel
tower. She is adding surprisingly to her stature every day. It is quite
within the probabilities that a century hence she will be the most
imposing figure that has cast its shadow across the globe since the
inauguration of our era. I grant that after saying these strong things,
it is necessary that I offer some details calculated to satisfactorily
demonstrate the proportions which I have claimed for her. I will do that
presently; but before exhibiting the matured sequoia gigantea, I believe
it will be best to exhibit the sprout from which it sprang. It may save
the reader from making miscalculations. The person who imagines that a
Big Tree sprout is bigger than other kinds of sprouts is quite mistaken.
It is the ordinary thing; it makes no show, it compels no notice, it
hasn’t a detectible quality in it that entitles it to attention, or
suggests the future giant its sap is suckling. That is the kind of
sprout Mrs. Eddy was.</p>
<p>From her childhood days up to where she was running a half-century a
close race and gaining on it, she was most humanly commonplace.</p>
<p>She is the witness I am drawing this from. She has revealed it in her
autobiography not intentionally, of course–I am not claiming that. An
autobiography is the most treacherous thing there is. It lets out every
secret its author is trying to keep; it lets the truth shine
unobstructed through every harmless little deception he tries to play;
it pitilessly exposes him as a tin hero worshipping himself as Big Metal
every time he tries to do the modest-unconsciousness act before the
reader. This is not guessing; I am speaking from autobiographical
personal experience; I was never able to refrain from mentioning, with a
studied casualness that could deceive none but the most incautious
reader, that an ancestor of mine was sent ambassador to Spain by Charles
I., nor that in a remote branch of my family there exists a claimant to
an earldom, nor that an uncle of mine used to own a dog that was
descended from the dog that was in the Ark; and at the same time I was
never able to persuade myself to call a gibbet by its right name when
accounting for other ancestors of mine, but always spoke of it as the
“platform“–puerilely intimating that they were out lecturing when it
happened.</p>
<p>It is Mrs. Eddy over again. As regards her minor half, she is as
commonplace as the rest of us. Vain of trivial things all the first half
of her life, and still vain of them at seventy and recording them with
naive satisfaction–even rescuing some early rhymes of hers of the sort
that we all scribble in the innocent days of our youth–rescuing them and
printing them without pity or apology, just as the weakest and commonest
of us do in our gray age. More–she still frankly admires them; and in
her introduction of them profanely confers upon them the holy name of
“poetry.“ Sample:</p>
<p>“And laud the land whose talents rock The cradle of her power, And
wreaths are twined round Plymouth Rock From erudition’s bower.“</p>
<p>“Minerva’s silver sandals still Are loosed and not effete.“</p>
<p>You note it is not a shade above the thing which all human beings
churn out in their youth.</p>
<p>You would not think that in a little wee primer–for that is what the
Autobiography is–a person with a tumultuous career of seventy years
behind her could find room for two or three pages of padding of this
kind, but such is the case. She evidently puts narrative together with
difficulty and is not at home in it, and is glad to have something
ready-made to fill in with. Another sample:</p>
<p>“Here fame-honored Hickory rears his bold form, And bears a brave
breast to the lightning and storm, While Palm, Bay, and Laurel in
classical glee, Chase Tulip, Magnolia, and fragrant Fringe-tree.“</p>
<p>Vivid? You can fairly see those trees galloping around. That she
could still treasure up, and print, and manifestly admire those Poems,
indicates that the most daring and masculine and masterful woman that
has appeared in the earth in centuries has the same soft, girly-girly
places in her that the rest of us have.</p>
<p>When it comes to selecting her ancestors she is still human, natural,
vain, commonplace–as commonplace as I am myself when I am sorting
ancestors for my autobiography. She combs out some creditable Scots, and
labels them and sets them aside for use, not overlooking the one to whom
Sir William Wallace gave “a heavy sword encased in a brass scabbard,“
and naively explaining which Sir William Wallace it was, lest we get the
wrong one by the hassock; this is the one “from whose patriotism and
bravery comes that heart-stirring air, ‘Scots wha hae wi’ Wallace
bled.’“ Hannah More was related to her ancestors. She explains who
Hannah More was.</p>
<p>Whenever a person informs us who Sir William Wallace was, or who
wrote “Hamlet,“ or where the Declaration of Independence was fought, it
fills us with a suspicion wellnigh amounting to conviction, that that
person would not suspect us of being so empty of knowledge if he wasn’t
suffering from the same “claim“ himself. Then we turn to page 20 of the
Autobiography and happen upon this passage, and that hasty suspicion
stands rebuked:</p>
<p>“I gained book-knowledge with far less labor than is usually
requisite. At ten years of age I was as familiar with Lindley Murray’s
Grammar as with the Westminster Catechism; and the latter I had to
repeat every Sunday. My favorite studies were Natural Philosophy, Logic,
and Moral Science. From my brother Albert I received lessons in the
ancient tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.“</p>
<p>You catch your breath in astonishment, and feel again and still again
the pang of that rebuke. But then your eye falls upon the next sentence
but one, and the pain passes away and you set up the suspicion again
with evil satisfaction:</p>
<p>“After my discovery of Christian Science, most of the knowledge I had
gleaned from school-books vanished like a dream.“</p>
<p>That disappearance accounts for much in her miscellaneous writings.
As I was saying, she handles her “ancestral shadows,“ as she calls them,
just as I do mine. It is remarkable. When she runs across “a relative of
my Grandfather Baker, General Henry Knox, of Revolutionary fame,“ she
sets him down; when she finds another good one, “the late Sir John
Macneill, in the line of my Grandfather Baker’s family,“ she sets him
down, and remembers that he “was prominent in British politics, and at
one time held the position of ambassador to Persia“; when she discovers
that her grandparents “were likewise connected with Captain John
Lovewell, whose gallant leadership and death in the Indian troubles of
1722-25 caused that prolonged contest to be known historically as
Lovewell’s War,“ she sets the Captain down; when it turns out that a
cousin of her grandmother “was John Macneill, the New Hampshire general,
who fought at Lundy’s Lane and won distinction in 1814 at the battle of
Chippewa,“ she catalogues the General. (And tells where Chippewa was.)
And then she skips all her platform people; never mentions one of them.
It shows that she is just as human as any of us.</p>
<p>Yet, after all, there is something very touching in her pride in
these worthy small-fry, and something large and fine in her modesty in
not caring to remember that their kinship to her can confer no
distinction upon her, whereas her mere mention of their names has
conferred upon them a faceless earthly immortality.</p>
