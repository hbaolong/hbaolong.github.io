<h4 id="johnny-greer">JOHNNY GREER</h4>
<p>“The church was densely crowded that lovely summer Sabbath,“ said the
Sunday-school superintendent, “and all, as their eyes rested upon the
small coffin, seemed impressed by the poor black boy’s fate. Above the
stillness the pastor’s voice rose, and chained the interest of every ear
as he told, with many an envied compliment, how that the brave, noble,
daring little Johnny Greer, when he saw the drowned body sweeping down
toward the deep part of the river whence the agonized parents never
could have recovered it in this world, gallantly sprang into the stream,
and, at the risk of his life, towed the corpse to shore, and held it
fast till help came and secured it. Johnny Greer was sitting just in
front of me. A ragged street-boy, with eager eye, turned upon him
instantly, and said in a hoarse whisper</p>
<p>“‘No; but did you, though?’</p>
<p>“‘Yes.’</p>
<p>“‘Towed the carkiss ashore and saved it yo’self?’</p>
<p>“‘Yes.’</p>
<p>“‘Cracky! What did they give you?’</p>
<p>“‘Nothing.’</p>
<p>“‘W-h-a-t [with intense disgust]! D’you know what I’d ’a’ done? I’d
‘a’ anchored him out in the stream, and said, Five dollars, gents, or
you carn’t have yo’ nigger.’“</p>
<p>THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF THE GREAT BEEF CONTRACT–[Written about
1867.]</p>
<p>In as few words as possible I wish to lay before the nation what’s
here, howsoever small, I have had in this matter–this matter which has
so exercised the public mind, engendered so much ill-feeling, and so
filled the newspapers of both continents with distorted statements and
extravagant comments.</p>
<p>The origin of this distressful thing was this–and I assert here that
every fact in the following resume can be amply proved by the official
records of the General Government.</p>
<p>John Wilson Mackenzie, of Rotterdam, Chemung County, New Jersey,
deceased, contracted with the General Government, on or about the 10th
day of October, 1861, to furnish to General Sherman the sum total of
thirty barrels of beef.</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>He started after Sherman with the beef, but when he got to Washington
Sherman had gone to Manassas; so he took the beef and followed him
there, but arrived too late; he followed him to Nashville, and from
Nashville to Chattanooga, and from Chattanooga to Atlanta–but he never
could overtake him. At Atlanta he took a fresh start and followed him
clear through his march to the sea. He arrived too late again by a few
days; but hearing that Sherman was going out in the Quaker City
excursion to the Holy Land, he took shipping for Beirut, calculating to
head off the other vessel. When he arrived in Jerusalem with his beef,
he learned that Sherman had not sailed in the Quaker City, but had gone
to the Plains to fight the Indians. He returned to America and started
for the Rocky Mountains. After sixty-eight days of arduous travel on the
Plains, and when he had got within four miles of Sherman’s headquarters,
he was tomahawked and scalped, and the Indians got the beef. They got
all of it but one barrel. Sherman’s army captured that, and so, even in
death, the bold navigator partly fulfilled his contract. In his will,
which he had kept like a journal, he bequeathed the contract to his son
Bartholomew W. Bartholomew W. made out the following bill, and then
died:</p>
<p>THE UNITED STATES</p>
<p>In account with JOHN WILSON MACKENZIE, of New Jersey, deceased, . . .
. . . . . . . Dr.</p>
<p>To thirty barrels of beef for General Sherman, at 00, ,000 To
traveling expenses and transportation . . . . . 14,000</p>
<p>Total . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,000 Rec’d Pay’t.</p>
<p>He died then; but he left the contract to Wm. J. Martin, who tried to
collect it, but died before he got through. He left it to Barker J.
Allen, and he tried to collect it also. He did not survive. Barker J.
Allen left it to Anson G. Rogers, who attempted to collect it, and got
along as far as the Ninth Auditor’s Office, when Death, the great
Leveler, came all unsummoned, and foreclosed on him also. He left the
bill to a relative of his in Connecticut, Vengeance Hopkins by name, who
lasted four weeks and two days, and made the best time on record, coming
within one of reaching the Twelfth Auditor. In his will he gave the
contract bill to his uncle, by the name of O-be-joyful Johnson. It was
too undermining for joyful. His last words were: “Weep not for me–I am
willing to go.“ And so he was, poor soul. Seven people inherited the
contract after that; but they all died. So it came into my hands at
last. It fell to me through a relative by the name of, Hubbard
–Bethlehem Hubbard, of Indiana. He had had a grudge against me for a
long time; but in his last moments he sent for me, and forgave me
everything, and, weeping, gave me the beef contract.</p>
<p>This ends the history of it up to the time that I succeeded to the
property. I will now endeavor to set myself straight before the nation
in everything that concerns my share in the matter. I took this beef
contract, and the bill for mileage and transportation, to the President
of the United States.</p>
<p>He said, “Well, sir, what can I do for you?“</p>
<p>I said, “Sire, on or about the 10th day of October, 1861, John Wilson
Mackenzie, of Rotterdam, Chemung County, New Jersey, deceased,
contracted with the General Government to furnish to General Sherman the
sum total of thirty barrels of beef–“</p>
<p>He stopped me there, and dismissed me from his presence–kindly, but
firmly. The next day called on the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>He said, “Well, sir?“</p>
<p>I said, “Your Royal Highness: on or about the 10th day of October,
1861, John Wilson Mackenzie of Rotterdam, Chemung County, New Jersey,
deceased, contracted with the General Government to furnish to General
Sherman the sum total of thirty barrels of beef–“</p>
<p>“That will do, sir–that will do; this office has nothing to do with
contracts for beef.“</p>
<p>I was bowed out. I thought the matter all over and finally, the
following day, I visited the Secretary of the Navy, who said, “Speak
quickly, sir; do not keep me waiting.“</p>
<p>I said, “Your Royal Highness, on or about the 10th day of October,
1861, John Wilson Mackenzie of Rotterdam, Chemung County, New Jersey,
deceased, contracted with the General Government to General Sherman the
sum total of thirty barrels of beef–“</p>
<p>Well, it was as far as I could get. He had nothing to do with beef
contracts for General Sherman either. I began to think it was a curious
kind of government. It looked somewhat as if they wanted to get out of
paying for that beef. The following day I went to the Secretary of the
Interior.</p>
<p>I said, “Your Imperial Highness, on or about the 10th day of
October–“</p>
<p>“That is sufficient, sir. I have heard of you before. Go, take your
infamous beef contract out of this establishment. The Interior
Department has nothing whatever to do with subsistence for the
army.“</p>
<p>I went away. But I was exasperated now. I said I would haunt them; I
would infest every department of this iniquitous government till that
contract business was settled. I would collect that bill, or fall, as
fell my predecessors, trying. I assailed the Postmaster-General; I
besieged the Agricultural Department; I waylaid the Speaker of the House
of Representatives. They had nothing to do with army contracts for beef.
I moved upon the Commissioner of the Patent Office.</p>
<p>I said, “Your August Excellency, on or about–“</p>
<p>“Perdition! have you got here with your incendiary beef contract, at
last? We have nothing to do with beef contracts for the army, my dear
sir.“</p>
<p>“Oh, that is all very well–but somebody has got to pay for that beef.
It has got to be paid now, too, or I’ll confiscate this old Patent
Office and everything in it.“</p>
<p>“But, my dear sir–“</p>
<p>“It don’t make any difference, sir. The Patent Office is liable for
that beef, I reckon; and, liable or not liable, the Patent Office has
got to pay for it.“</p>
<p>Never mind the details. It ended in a fight. The Patent Office won.
But I found out something to my advantage. I was told that the Treasury
Department was the proper place for me to go to. I went there. I waited
two hours and a half, and then I was admitted to the First Lord of the
Treasury.</p>
<p>I said, “Most noble, grave, and reverend Signor, on or about the 10th
day of October, 1861, John Wilson Macken–“</p>
<p>“That is sufficient, sir. I have heard of you. Go to the First
Auditor of the Treasury.“</p>
<p>I did so. He sent me to the Second Auditor. The Second Auditor sent
me to the Third, and the Third sent me to the First Comptroller of the
Corn-Beef Division. This began to look like business. He examined his
books and all his loose papers, but found no minute of the beef
contract. I went to the Second Comptroller of the Corn-Beef Division. He
examined his books and his loose papers, but with no success. I was
encouraged. During that week I got as far as the Sixth Comptroller in
that division; the next week I got through the Claims Department; the
third week I began and completed the Mislaid Contracts Department, and
got a foothold in the Dead Reckoning Department. I finished that in
three days. There was only one place left for it now. I laid siege to
the Commissioner of Odds and Ends. To his clerk, rather–he was not there
himself. There were sixteen beautiful young ladies in the room, writing
in books, and there were seven well-favored young clerks showing them
how. The young women smiled up over their shoulders, and the clerks
smiled back at them, and all went merry as a marriage bell. Two or three
clerks that were reading the newspapers looked at me rather hard, but
went on reading, and nobody said anything. However, I had been used to
this kind of alacrity from Fourth Assistant Junior Clerks all through my
eventful career, from the very day I entered the first office of the
Corn-Beef Bureau clear till I passed out of the last one in the Dead
Reckoning Division. I had got so accomplished by this time that I could
stand on one foot from the moment I entered an office till a clerk spoke
to me, without changing more than two, or maybe three, times.</p>
<p>So I stood there till I had changed four different times. Then I said
to one of the clerks who was reading:</p>
<p>“Illustrious Vagrant, where is the Grand Turk?“</p>
<p>“What do you mean, sir? whom do you mean? If you mean the Chief of
the Bureau, he is out.“</p>
<p>“Will he visit the harem to-day?“</p>
<p>The young man glared upon me awhile, and then went on reading his
paper. But I knew the ways of those clerks. I knew I was safe if he got
through before another New York mail arrived. He only had two more
papers left. After a while he finished them, and then he yawned and
asked me what I wanted.</p>
<p>“Renowned and honored Imbecile: on or about–“</p>
<p>“You are the beef-contract man. Give me your papers.“</p>
<p>He took them, and for a long time he ransacked his odds and ends.
Finally he found the Northwest Passage, as I regarded it–he found the
long lost record of that beef contract–he found the rock upon which so
many of my ancestors had split before they ever got to it. I was deeply
moved. And yet I rejoiced–for I had survived. I said with emotion, “Give
it me. The government will settle now.“ He waved me back, and said there
was something yet to be done first.</p>
<p>“Where is this John Wilson Mackenzie?“ said he.</p>
<p>“Dead.“</p>
<p>“When did he die?“</p>
<p>“He didn’t die at all–he was killed.“</p>
<p>“How?“</p>
<p>“Tomahawked.“</p>
<p>“Who tomahawked him?“</p>
<p>“Why, an Indian, of course. You didn’t suppose it was the
superintendent of a Sunday-school, did you?“</p>
<p>“No. An Indian, was it?“</p>
<p>“The same.“</p>
<p>“Name of the Indian?“</p>
<p>“His name? I don’t know his name.“</p>
<p>“Must have his name. Who saw the tomahawking done?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know.“</p>
<p>“You were not present yourself, then?“</p>
<p>“Which you can see by my hair. I was absent.</p>
<p>“Then how do you know that Mackenzie is dead?“</p>
<p>“Because he certainly died at that time, and have every reason to
believe that he has been dead ever since. I know he has, in fact.“</p>
<p>“We must have proofs. Have you got this Indian?“</p>
<p>“Of course not.“</p>
<p>“Well, you must get him. Have you got the tomahawk?“</p>
<p>“I never thought of such a thing.“</p>
<p>“You must get the tomahawk. You must produce the Indian and the
tomahawk. If Mackenzie’s death can be proven by these, you can then go
before the commission appointed to audit claims with some show of
getting your bill under such headway that your children may possibly
live to receive the money and enjoy it. But that man’s death must be
proven. However, I may as well tell you that the government will never
pay that transportation and those traveling expenses of the lamented
Mackenzie. It may possibly pay for the barrel of beef that Sherman’s
soldiers captured, if you can get a relief bill through Congress making
an appropriation for that purpose; but it will not pay for the
twenty-nine barrels the Indians ate.“</p>
<p>“Then there is only a hundred dollars due me, and that isn’t certain!
After all Mackenzie’s travels in Europe, Asia, and America with that
beef; after all his trials and tribulations and transportation; after
the slaughter of all those innocents that tried to collect that bill!
Young man, why didn’t the First Comptroller of the Corn-Beef Division
tell me this?“</p>
<p>“He didn’t know anything about the genuineness of your claim.“</p>
<p>“Why didn’t the Second tell me? why didn’t the, Third? why didn’t all
those divisions and departments tell me?“</p>
<p>“None of them knew. We do things by routine here. You have followed
the routine and found out what you wanted to know. It is the best way.
It is the only way. It is very regular, and very slow, but it is very
certain.“</p>
<p>“Yes, certain death. It has been, to the most of our tribe. I begin
to feel that I, too, am called.“</p>
<p>“Young man, you love the bright creature yonder with the gentle blue
eyes and the steel pens behind her ears–I see it in your soft glances;
you wish to marry her–but you are poor. Here, hold out your hand–here is
the beef contract; go, take her and be happy Heaven bless you, my
children!“</p>
<p>This is all I know about the great beef contract that has created so
much talk in the community. The clerk to whom I bequeathed it died. I
know nothing further about the contract, or any one connected with it. I
only know that if a man lives long enough he can trace a thing through
the Circumlocution Office of Washington and find out, after much labor
and trouble and delay, that which he could have found out on the first
day if the business of the Circumlocution Office were as ingeniously
systematized as it would be if it were a great private mercantile
institution.</p>
