<h4 id="chapter-viii.">CHAPTER VIII.</h4>
<p>In a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our necks
and watching for the “pony-rider“–the fleet messenger who sped across
the continent from St. Joe to Sacramento, carrying letters nineteen
hundred miles in eight days! Think of that for perishable horse and
human flesh and blood to do! The pony-rider was usually a little bit of
a man, brimful of spirit and endurance. No matter what time of the day
or night his watch came on, and no matter whether it was winter or
summer, raining, snowing, hailing, or sleeting, or whether his “beat“
was a level straight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and
precipices, or whether it led through peaceful regions or regions that
swarmed with hostile Indians, he must be always ready to leap into the
saddle and be off like the wind! There was no idling-time for a
pony-rider on duty. He rode fifty miles without stopping, by daylight,
moonlight, starlight, or through the blackness of darkness–just as it
happened. He rode a splendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and
lodged like a gentleman; kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles, and
then, as he came crashing up to the station where stood two men holding
fast a fresh, impatient steed, the transfer of rider and mail-bag was
made in the twinkling of an eye, and away flew the eager pair and were
out of sight before the spectator could get hardly the ghost of a look.
Both rider and horse went “flying light.“ The rider’s dress was thin,
and fitted close; he wore a “round-about,“ and a skull-cap, and tucked
his pantaloons into his boot-tops like a race-rider. He carried no
arms–he carried nothing that was not absolutely necessary, for even the
postage on his literary freight was worth five dollars a letter.</p>
<p>He got but little frivolous correspondence to carry–his bag had
business letters in it, mostly. His horse was stripped of all
unnecessary weight, too. He wore a little wafer of a racing-saddle, and
no visible blanket. He wore light shoes, or none at all. The little flat
mail-pockets strapped under the rider’s thighs would each hold about the
bulk of a child’s primer. They held many and many an important business
chapter and newspaper letter, but these were written on paper as airy
and thin as gold-leaf, nearly, and thus bulk and weight were economized.
The stage-coach traveled about a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five
miles a day (twenty-four hours), the pony-rider about two hundred and
fifty. There were about eighty pony-riders in the saddle all the time,
night and day, stretching in a long, scattering procession from Missouri
to California, forty flying eastward, and forty toward the west, and
among them making four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring livelihood
and see a deal of scenery every single day in the year.</p>
<p>We had had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a
pony-rider, but somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us
managed to streak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and a
hail, and the swift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get
our heads out of the windows. But now we were expecting one along every
moment, and would see him in broad daylight. Presently the driver
exclaims:</p>
<p>“HERE HE COMES!“</p>
<p>Every neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider. Away
across the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears
against the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I should think
so!</p>
<p>In a second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling,
rising and falling–sweeping toward us nearer and nearer–growing more and
more distinct, more and more sharply defined–nearer and still nearer,
and the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear–another instant a
whoop and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider’s hand, but
no reply, and man and horse burst past our excited faces, and go winging
away like a belated fragment of a storm!</p>
<p>So sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy, that but
for the flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mail-sack
after the vision had flashed by and disappeared, we might have doubted
whether we had seen any actual horse and man at all, maybe.</p>
<p>We rattled through Scott’s Bluffs Pass, by and by. It was along here
somewhere that we first came across genuine and unmistakable alkali
water in the road, and we cordially hailed it as a first-class
curiosity, and a thing to be mentioned with eclat in letters to the
ignorant at home. This water gave the road a soapy appearance, and in
many places the ground looked as if it had been whitewashed. I think the
strange alkali water excited us as much as any wonder we had come upon
yet, and I know we felt very complacent and conceited, and better
satisfied with life after we had added it to our list of things which we
had seen and some other people had not. In a small way we were the same
sort of simpletons as those who climb unnecessarily the perilous peaks
of Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn, and derive no pleasure from it except
the reflection that it isn’t a common experience. But once in a while
one of those parties trips and comes darting down the long
mountain-crags in a sitting posture, making the crusted snow smoke
behind him, flitting from bench to bench, and from terrace to terrace,
jarring the earth where he strikes, and still glancing and flitting on
again, sticking an iceberg into himself every now and then, and tearing
his clothes, snatching at things to save himself, taking hold of trees
and fetching them along with him, roots and all, starting little rocks
now and then, then big boulders, then acres of ice and snow and patches
of forest, gathering and still gathering as he goes, adding and still
adding to his massed and sweeping grandeur as he nears a three
thousand-foot precipice, till at last he waves his hat magnificently and
rides into eternity on the back of a raging and tossing avalanche!</p>
<p>This is all very fine, but let us not be carried away by excitement,
but ask calmly, how does this person feel about it in his cooler moments
next day, with six or seven thousand feet of snow and stuff on top of
him?</p>
<p>We crossed the sand hills near the scene of the Indian mail robbery
and massacre of 1856, wherein the driver and conductor perished, and
also all the passengers but one, it was supposed; but this must have
been a mistake, for at different times afterward on the Pacific coast I
was personally acquainted with a hundred and thirty-three or four people
who were wounded during that massacre, and barely escaped with their
lives. There was no doubt of the truth of it–I had it from their own
lips. One of these parties told me that he kept coming across
arrow-heads in his system for nearly seven years after the massacre; and
another of them told me that he was struck so literally full of arrows
that after the Indians were gone and he could raise up and examine
himself, he could not restrain his tears, for his clothes were
completely ruined.</p>
<p>The most trustworthy tradition avers, however, that only one man, a
person named Babbitt, survived the massacre, and he was desperately
wounded. He dragged himself on his hands and knee (for one leg was
broken) to a station several miles away. He did it during portions of
two nights, lying concealed one day and part of another, and for more
than forty hours suffering unimaginable anguish from hunger, thirst and
bodily pain. The Indians robbed the coach of everything it contained,
including quite an amount of treasure.</p>
