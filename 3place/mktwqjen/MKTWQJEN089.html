<h4 id="chapter-xxiii.">CHAPTER XXIII.</h4>
<p>If there is any life that is happier than the life we led on our
timber ranch for the next two or three weeks, it must be a sort of life
which I have not read of in books or experienced in person. We did not
see a human being but ourselves during the time, or hear any sounds but
those that were made by the wind and the waves, the sighing of the
pines, and now and then the far-off thunder of an avalanche. The forest
about us was dense and cool, the sky above us was cloudless and
brilliant with sunshine, the broad lake before us was glassy and clear,
or rippled and breezy, or black and storm-tossed, according to Nature’s
mood; and its circling border of mountain domes, clothed with forests,
scarred with land-slides, cloven by canons and valleys, and helmeted
with glittering snow, fitly framed and finished the noble picture. The
view was always fascinating, bewitching, entrancing. The eye was never
tired of gazing, night or day, in calm or storm; it suffered but one
grief, and that was that it could not look always, but must close
sometimes in sleep.</p>
<p>We slept in the sand close to the water’s edge, between two
protecting boulders, which took care of the stormy night-winds for us.
We never took any paregoric to make us sleep. At the first break of dawn
we were always up and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical
vigor and exuberance of spirits. That is, Johnny was–but I held his hat.
While smoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel
peaks put on the glory of the sun, and followed the conquering light as
it swept down among the shadows, and set the captive crags and forests
free. We watched the tinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water
till every little detail of forest, precipice and pinnacle was wrought
in and finished, and the miracle of the enchanter complete. Then to
“business.“</p>
<p>That is, drifting around in the boat. We were on the north shore.
There, the rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray, sometimes white. This
gives the marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage than it
has elsewhere on the lake. We usually pushed out a hundred yards or so
from shore, and then lay down on the thwarts, in the sun, and let the
boat drift by the hour whither it would. We seldom talked. It
interrupted the Sabbath stillness, and marred the dreams the luxurious
rest and indolence brought. The shore all along was indented with deep,
curved bays and coves, bordered by narrow sand-beaches; and where the
sand ended, the steep mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space–rose
up like a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular, and thickly
wooded with tall pines.</p>
<p>So singularly clear was the water, that where it was only twenty or
thirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct that the boat
seemed floating in the air! Yes, where it was even eighty feet deep.
Every little pebble was distinct, every speckled trout, every
hand’s-breadth of sand. Often, as we lay on our faces, a granite
boulder, as large as a village church, would start out of the bottom
apparently, and seem climbing up rapidly to the surface, till presently
it threatened to touch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to
seize an oar and avert the danger. But the boat would float on, and the
boulder descend again, and then we could see that when we had been
exactly above it, it must still have been twenty or thirty feet below
the surface. Down through the transparency of these great depths, the
water was not merely transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so. All
objects seen through it had a bright, strong vividness, not only of
outline, but of every minute detail, which they would not have had when
seen simply through the same depth of atmosphere. So empty and airy did
all spaces seem below us, and so strong was the sense of floating high
aloft in mid-nothingness, that we called these boat-excursions
“balloon-voyages.“</p>
<p>We fished a good deal, but we did not average one fish a week. We
could see trout by the thousand winging about in the emptiness under us,
or sleeping in shoals on the bottom, but they would not bite–they could
see the line too plainly, perhaps. We frequently selected the trout we
wanted, and rested the bait patiently and persistently on the end of his
nose at a depth of eighty feet, but he would only shake it off with an
annoyed manner, and shift his position.</p>
<p>We bathed occasionally, but the water was rather chilly, for all it
looked so sunny. Sometimes we rowed out to the “blue water,“ a mile or
two from shore. It was as dead blue as indigo there, because of the
immense depth. By official measurement the lake in its centre is one
thousand five hundred and twenty-five feet deep!</p>
<p>Sometimes, on lazy afternoons, we lolled on the sand in camp, and
smoked pipes and read some old well-worn novels. At night, by the
camp-fire, we played euchre and seven-up to strengthen the mind–and
played them with cards so greasy and defaced that only a whole summer’s
acquaintance with them could enable the student to tell the ace of clubs
from the jack of diamonds.</p>
<p>We never slept in our “house.“ It never recurred to us, for one
thing; and besides, it was built to hold the ground, and that was
enough. We did not wish to strain it.</p>
<p>By and by our provisions began to run short, and we went back to the
old camp and laid in a new supply. We were gone all day, and reached
home again about night-fall, pretty tired and hungry. While Johnny was
carrying the main bulk of the provisions up to our “house“ for future
use, I took the loaf of bread, some slices of bacon, and the coffee-pot,
ashore, set them down by a tree, lit a fire, and went back to the boat
to get the frying-pan. While I was at this, I heard a shout from Johnny,
and looking up I saw that my fire was galloping all over the premises!
Johnny was on the other side of it. He had to run through the flames to
get to the lake shore, and then we stood helpless and watched the
devastation.</p>
<p>The ground was deeply carpeted with dry pine-needles, and the fire
touched them off as if they were gunpowder. It was wonderful to see with
what fierce speed the tall sheet of flame traveled! My coffee-pot was
gone, and everything with it. In a minute and a half the fire seized
upon a dense growth of dry manzanita chapparal six or eight feet high,
and then the roaring and popping and crackling was something terrific.
We were driven to the boat by the intense heat, and there we remained,
spell-bound.</p>
<p>Within half an hour all before us was a tossing, blinding tempest of
flame! It went surging up adjacent ridges–surmounted them and
disappeared in the canons beyond–burst into view upon higher and farther
ridges, presently–shed a grander illumination abroad, and dove again
–flamed out again, directly, higher and still higher up the
mountain-side–threw out skirmishing parties of fire here and there, and
sent them trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts and
ribs and gorges, till as far as the eye could reach the lofty
mountain-fronts were webbed as it were with a tangled network of red
lava streams. Away across the water the crags and domes were lit with a
ruddy glare, and the firmament above was a reflected hell!</p>
<p>Every feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing mirror of
the lake! Both pictures were sublime, both were beautiful; but that in
the lake had a bewildering richness about it that enchanted the eye and
held it with the stronger fascination.</p>
<p>We sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours. We never
thought of supper, and never felt fatigue. But at eleven o’clock the
conflagration had traveled beyond our range of vision, and then darkness
stole down upon the landscape again.</p>
<p>Hunger asserted itself now, but there was nothing to eat. The
provisions were all cooked, no doubt, but we did not go to see. We were
homeless wanderers again, without any property. Our fence was gone, our
house burned down; no insurance. Our pine forest was well scorched, the
dead trees all burned up, and our broad acres of manzanita swept away.
Our blankets were on our usual sand-bed, however, and so we lay down and
went to sleep. The next morning we started back to the old camp, but
while out a long way from shore, so great a storm came up that we dared
not try to land. So I baled out the seas we shipped, and Johnny pulled
heavily through the billows till we had reached a point three or four
miles beyond the camp. The storm was increasing, and it became evident
that it was better to take the hazard of beaching the boat than go down
in a hundred fathoms of water; so we ran in, with tall white-caps
following, and I sat down in the stern-sheets and pointed her head-on to
the shore. The instant the bow struck, a wave came over the stern that
washed crew and cargo ashore, and saved a deal of trouble. We shivered
in the lee of a boulder all the rest of the day, and froze all the night
through. In the morning the tempest had gone down, and we paddled down
to the camp without any unnecessary delay. We were so starved that we
ate up the rest of the Brigade’s provisions, and then set out to Carson
to tell them about it and ask their forgiveness. It was accorded, upon
payment of damages.</p>
<p>We made many trips to the lake after that, and had many a
hair-breadth escape and blood-curdling adventure which will never be
recorded in any history.</p>
