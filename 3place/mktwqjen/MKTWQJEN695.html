<h4 id="chapter-x.">CHAPTER X.</h4>
<p>Everything human is pathetic. The secret source of Humor itself is
not joy but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s
New Calendar.</p>
<p>Captain Cook found Australia in 1770, and eighteen years later the
British Government began to transport convicts to it. Altogether, New
South Wales received 83,000 in 53 years. The convicts wore heavy chains;
they were ill-fed and badly treated by the officers set over them; they
were heavily punished for even slight infractions of the rules; “the
cruelest discipline ever known“ is one historian’s description of their
life.–[The Story of Australasia. J. S. Laurie.]</p>
<p>English law was hard-hearted in those days. For trifling offenses
which in our day would be punished by a small fine or a few days’
confinement, men, women, and boys were sent to this other end of the
earth to serve terms of seven and fourteen years; and for serious crimes
they were transported for life. Children were sent to the penal colonies
for seven years for stealing a rabbit!</p>
<p>When I was in London twenty-three years ago there was a new penalty
in force for diminishing garroting and wife-beating–25 lashes on the
bare back with the cat-o’-nine-tails. It was said that this terrible
punishment was able to bring the stubbornest ruffians to terms; and that
no man had been found with grit enough to keep his emotions to himself
beyond the ninth blow; as a rule the man shrieked earlier. That penalty
had a great and wholesome effect upon the garroters and wife-beaters;
but humane modern London could not endure it; it got its law rescinded.
Many a bruised and battered English wife has since had occasion to
deplore that cruel achievement of sentimental “humanity.“</p>
<p>Twenty-five lashes! In Australia and Tasmania they gave a convict
fifty for almost any little offense; and sometimes a brutal officer
would add fifty, and then another fifty, and so on, as long as the
sufferer could endure the torture and live. In Tasmania I read the
entry, in an old manuscript official record, of a case where a convict
was given three hundred lashes–for stealing some silver spoons. And men
got more than that, sometimes. Who handled the cat? Often it was another
convict; sometimes it was the culprit’s dearest comrade; and he had to
lay on with all his might; otherwise he would get a flogging himself for
his mercy –for he was under watch–and yet not do his friend any good:
the friend would be attended to by another hand and suffer no lack in
the matter of full punishment.</p>
<p>The convict life in Tasmania was so unendurable, and suicide so
difficult to accomplish that once or twice despairing men got together
and drew straws to determine which of them should kill another of the
group–this murder to secure death to the perpetrator and to the
witnesses of it by the hand of the hangman!</p>
<p>The incidents quoted above are mere hints, mere suggestions of what
convict life was like–they are but a couple of details tossed into view
out of a shoreless sea of such; or, to change the figure, they are but a
pair of flaming steeples photographed from a point which hides from
sight the burning city which stretches away from their bases on every
hand.</p>
<p>Some of the convicts–indeed, a good many of them–were very bad
people, even for that day; but the most of them were probably not
noticeably worse than the average of the people they left behind them at
home. We must believe this; we cannot avoid it. We are obliged to
believe that a nation that could look on, unmoved, and see starving or
freezing women hanged for stealing twenty-six cents’ worth of bacon or
rags, and boys snatched from their mothers, and men from their families,
and sent to the other side of the world for long terms of years for
similar trifling offenses, was a nation to whom the term “civilized“
could not in any large way be applied. And we must also believe that a
nation that knew, during more than forty years, what was happening to
those exiles and was still content with it, was not advancing in any
showy way toward a higher grade of civilization.</p>
<p>If we look into the characters and conduct of the officers and
gentlemen who had charge of the convicts and attended to their backs and
stomachs, we must grant again that as between the convict and his
masters, and between both and the nation at home, there was a quite
noticeable monotony of sameness.</p>
<p>Four years had gone by, and many convicts had come. Respectable
settlers were beginning to arrive. These two classes of colonists had to
be protected, in case of trouble among themselves or with the natives.
It is proper to mention the natives, though they could hardly count they
were so scarce. At a time when they had not as yet begun to be much
disturbed–not as yet being in the way–it was estimated that in New South
Wales there was but one native to 45,000 acres of territory.</p>
<p>People had to be protected. Officers of the regular army did not want
this service–away off there where neither honor nor distinction was to
be gained. So England recruited and officered a kind of militia force of
1,000 uniformed civilians called the “New South Wales Corps“ and shipped
it.</p>
<p>This was the worst blow of all. The colony fairly staggered under it.
The Corps was an object-lesson of the moral condition of England outside
of the jails. The colonists trembled. It was feared that next there
would be an importation of the nobility.</p>
<p>In those early days the colony was non-supporting. All the
necessaries of life–food, clothing, and all–were sent out from England,
and kept in great government store-houses, and given to the convicts and
sold to the settlers–sold at a trifling advance upon cost. The Corps saw
its opportunity. Its officers went into commerce, and in a most lawless
way. They went to importing rum, and also to manufacturing it in private
stills, in defiance of the government’s commands and protests. They
leagued themselves together and ruled the market; they boycotted the
government and the other dealers; they established a close monopoly and
kept it strictly in their own hands. When a vessel arrived with spirits,
they allowed nobody to buy but themselves, and they forced the owner to
sell to them at a price named by themselves–and it was always low
enough. They bought rum at an average of two dollars a gallon and sold
it at an average of ten. They made rum the currency of the country–for
there was little or no money–and they maintained their devastating hold
and kept the colony under their heel for eighteen or twenty years before
they were finally conquered and routed by the government.</p>
<p>Meantime, they had spread intemperance everywhere. And they had
squeezed farm after farm out of the settlers hands for rum, and thus had
bountifully enriched themselves. When a farmer was caught in the last
agonies of thirst they took advantage of him and sweated him for a
drink. In one instance they sold a man a gallon of rum worth two dollars
for a piece of property which was sold some years later for 00,000. When
the colony was about eighteen or twenty years old it was discovered that
the land was specially fitted for the wool-culture. Prosperity followed,
commerce with the world began, by and by rich mines of the noble metals
were opened, immigrants flowed in, capital likewise. The result is the
great and wealthy and enlightened commonwealth of New South Wales.</p>
<p>It is a country that is rich in mines, wool ranches, trams, railways,
steamship lines, schools, newspapers, botanical gardens, art galleries,
libraries, museums, hospitals, learned societies; it is the hospitable
home of every species of culture and of every species of material
enterprise, and there is a, church at every man’s door, and a race-track
over the way.</p>
