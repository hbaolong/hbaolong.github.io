<h4 id="my-boyhood-dreams">MY BOYHOOD DREAMS</h4>
<p>The dreams of my boyhood? No, they have not been realised. For all
who are old, there is something infinitely pathetic about the subject
which you have chosen, for in no greyhead’s case can it suggest any but
one thing–disappointment. Disappointment is its own reason for its pain:
the quality or dignity of the hope that failed is a matter aside. The
dreamer’s valuation of the thing lost–not another man’s–is the only
standard to measure it by, and his grief for it makes it large and great
and fine, and is worthy of our reverence in all cases. We should
carefully remember that. There are sixteen hundred million people in the
world. Of these there is but a trifling number–in fact, only
thirty-eight millions–who can understand why a person should have an
ambition to belong to the French army; and why, belonging to it, he
should be proud of that; and why, having got down that far, he should
want to go on down, down, down till he struck the bottom and got on the
General Staff; and why, being stripped of this livery, or set free and
reinvested with his self-respect by any other quick and thorough
process, let it be what it might, he should wish to return to his
strange serfage. But no matter: the estimate put upon these things by
the fifteen hundred and sixty millions is no proper measure of their
value: the proper measure, the just measure, is that which is put upon
them by Dreyfus, and is cipherable merely upon the littleness or the
vastness of the disappointment which their loss cost him. There you have
it: the measure of the magnitude of a dream-failure is the measure of
the disappointment the failure cost the dreamer; the value, in others’
eyes, of the thing lost, has nothing to do with the matter. With this
straightening out and classification of the dreamer’s position to help
us, perhaps we can put ourselves in his place and respect his
dream–Dreyfus’s, and the dreams our friends have cherished and reveal to
us. Some that I call to mind, some that have been revealed to me, are
curious enough; but we may not smile at them, for they were precious to
the dreamers, and their failure has left scars which give them dignity
and pathos. With this theme in my mind, dear heads that were brown when
they and mine were young together rise old and white before me now,
beseeching me to speak for them, and most lovingly will I do it.
Howells, Hay, Aldrich, Matthews, Stockton, Cable, Remus–how their young
hopes and ambitions come flooding back to my memory now, out of the
vague far past, the beautiful past, the lamented past! I remember it so
well–that night we met together–it was in Boston, and Mr. Fiends was
there, and Mr. Osgood, Ralph Keeler, and Boyle O’Reilly, lost to us now
these many years–and under the seal of confidence revealed to each other
what our boyhood dreams had been: reams which had not as yet been
blighted, but over which was stealing the grey of the night that was to
come–a night which we prophetically felt, and this feeling oppressed us
and made us sad. I remember that Howells’s voice broke twice, and it was
only with great difficulty that he was able to go on; in the end he
wept. For he had hoped to be an auctioneer. He told of his early
struggles to climb to his goal, and how at last he attained to within a
single step of the coveted summit. But there misfortune after misfortune
assailed him, and he went down, and down, and down, until now at last,
weary and disheartened, he had for the present given up the struggle and
become the editor of the Atlantic Monthly. This was in 1830. Seventy
years are gone since, and where now is his dream? It will never be
fulfilled. And it is best so; he is no longer fitted for the position;
no one would take him now; even if he got it, he would not be able to do
himself credit in it, on account of his deliberateness of speech and
lack of trained professional vivacity; he would be put on real estate,
and would have the pain of seeing younger and abler men intrusted with
the furniture and other such goods–goods which draw a mixed and
intellectually low order of customers, who must be beguiled of their
bids by a vulgar and specialised humour and sparkle, accompanied with
antics. But it is not the thing lost that counts, but only the
disappointment the loss brings to the dreamer that had coveted that
thing and had set his heart of hearts upon it, and when we remember
this, a great wave of sorrow for Howells rises in our breasts, and we
wish for his sake that his fate could have been different. At that time
Hay’s boyhood dream was not yet past hope of realisation, but it was
fading, dimming, wasting away, and the wind of a growing apprehension
was blowing cold over the perishing summer of his life. In the pride of
his young ambition he had aspired to be a steamboat mate; and in fancy
saw himself dominating a forecastle some day on the Mississippi and
dictating terms to roustabouts in high and wounding terms. I look back
now, from this far distance of seventy years, and note with sorrow the
stages of that dream’s destruction. Hay’s history is but Howells’s, with
differences of detail. Hay climbed high toward his ideal; when success
seemed almost sure, his foot upon the very gang-plank, his eye upon the
capstan, misfortune came and his fall began. Down–down–down–ever down:
Private Secretary to the President; Colonel in the field; Charge
d’Affaires in Paris; Charge d’Affaires in Vienna; Poet; Editor of the
Tribune; Biographer of Lincoln; Ambassador to England; and now at last
there he lies–Secretary of State, Head of Foreign Affairs. And he has
fallen like Lucifer, never to rise again. And his dream–where now is his
dream? Gone down in blood and tears with the dream of the auctioneer.
And the young dream of Aldrich–where is that? I remember yet how he sat
there that night fondling it, petting it; seeing it recede and ever
recede; trying to be reconciled and give it up, but not able yet to bear
the thought; for it had been his hope to be a horse-doctor. He also
climbed high, but, like the others, fell; then fell again, and yet
again, and again and again. And now at last he can fall no further. He
is old now, he has ceased to struggle, and is only a poet. No one would
risk a horse with him now. His dream is over. Has any boyhood dream ever
been fulfilled? I must doubt it. Look at Brander Matthews. He wanted to
be a cowboy. What is he to-day? Nothing but a professor in a university.
Will he ever be a cowboy? It is hardly conceivable. Look at Stockton.
What was Stockton’s young dream? He hoped to be a barkeeper. See where
he has landed. Is it better with Cable? What was Cable’s young dream? To
be ring-master in the circus, and swell around and crack the whip. What
is he to-day? Nothing but a theologian and novelist. And Uncle
Remus–what was his young dream? To be a buccaneer. Look at him now. Ah,
the dreams of our youth, how beautiful they are, and how perishable! The
ruins of these might-have-beens, how pathetic! The heart-secrets that
were revealed that night now so long vanished, how they touch me as I
give them voice! Those sweet privacies, how they endeared us to each
other! We were under oath never to tell any of these things, and I have
always kept that oath inviolate when speaking with persons whom I
thought not worthy to hear them. Oh, our lost Youth–God keep its memory
green in our hearts! for Age is upon us, with the indignity of its
infirmities, and Death beckons!</p>
