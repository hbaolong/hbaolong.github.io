Life</h4>
<p>IN the course of the tug-boat gossip, it came out that out of every
five of my former friends who had quitted the river, four had chosen
farming as an occupation. Of course this was not because they were
peculiarly gifted, agriculturally, and thus more likely to succeed as
farmers than in other industries: the reason for their choice must be
traced to some other source. Doubtless they chose farming because that
life is private and secluded from irruptions of undesirable
strangers–like the pilot- house hermitage. And doubtless they also chose
it because on a thousand nights of black storm and danger they had noted
the twinkling lights of solitary farm-houses, as the boat swung by, and
pictured to themselves the serenity and security and coziness of such
refuges at such times, and so had by-and-bye come to dream of that
retired and peaceful life as the one desirable thing to long for,
anticipate, earn, and at last enjoy.</p>
<p>But I did not learn that any of these pilot-farmers had astonished
anybody with their successes. Their farms do not support them: they
support their farms. The pilot-farmer disappears from the river
annually, about the breaking of spring, and is seen no more till next
frost. Then he appears again, in damaged homespun, combs the hayseed out
of his hair, and takes a pilot-house berth for the winter. In this way
he pays the debts which his farming has achieved during the agricultural
season. So his river bondage is but half broken; he is still the river’s
slave the hardest half of the year.</p>
<p>One of these men bought a farm, but did not retire to it. He knew a
trick worth two of that. He did not propose to pauperize his farm by
applying his personal ignorance to working it. No, he put the farm into
the hands of an agricultural expert to be worked on shares–out of every
three loads of corn the expert to have two and the pilot the third. But
at the end of the season the pilot received no corn. The expert
explained that his share was not reached. The farm produced only two
loads.</p>
<p>Some of the pilots whom I had known had had adventures–the outcome
fortunate, sometimes, but not in all cases. Captain Montgomery, whom I
had steered for when he was a pilot, commanded the Confederate fleet in
the great battle before Memphis; when his vessel went down, he swam
ashore, fought his way through a squad of soldiers, and made a gallant
and narrow escape. He was always a cool man; nothing could disturb his
serenity. Once when he was captain of the ‘Crescent City,’ I was
bringing the boat into port at New Orleans, and momently expecting
orders from the hurricane deck, but received none. I had stopped the
wheels, and there my authority and responsibility ceased. It was
evening–dim twilight–the captain’s hat was perched upon the big bell,
and I supposed the intellectual end of the captain was in it, but such
was not the case. The captain was very strict; therefore I knew better
than to touch a bell without orders. My duty was to hold the boat
steadily on her calamitous course, and leave the consequences to take
care of themselves–which I did. So we went plowing past the sterns of
steamboats and getting closer and closer–the crash was bound to come
very soon–and still that hat never budged; for alas, the captain was
napping in the texas…. Things were becoming exceedingly nervous and
uncomfortable. It seemed to me that the captain was not going to appear
in time to see the entertainment. But he did. Just as we were walking
into the stern of a steamboat, he stepped out on deck, and said, with
heavenly serenity, ‘Set her back on both’–which I did; but a trifle
late, however, for the next moment we went smashing through that other
boat’s flimsy outer works with a most prodigious racket. The captain
never said a word to me about the matter afterwards, except to remark
that I had done right, and that he hoped I would not hesitate to act in
the same way again in like circumstances.</p>
<p>One of the pilots whom I had known when I was on the river had died a
very honorable death. His boat caught fire, and he remained at the wheel
until he got her safe to land. Then he went out over the breast- board
with his clothing in flames, and was the last person to get ashore. He
died from his injuries in the course of two or three hours, and his was
the only life lost.</p>
<p>The history of Mississippi piloting affords six or seven instances of
this sort of martyrdom, and half a hundred instances of escapes from a
like fate which came within a second or two of being fatally too late;
BUT THERE IS NO INSTANCE OF A PILOT DESERTING HIS POST TO SAVE HIS LIFE
WHILE BY REMAINING AND SACRIFICING IT HE MIGHT SECURE OTHER LIVES FROM
DESTRUCTION. It is well worth while to set down this noble fact, and
well worth while to put it in italics, too.</p>
<p>The ‘cub’ pilot is early admonished to despise all perils connected
with a pilot’s calling, and to prefer any sort of death to the deep
dishonor of deserting his post while there is any possibility of his
being useful in it. And so effectively are these admonitions inculcated,
that even young and but half-tried pilots can be depended upon to stick
to the wheel, and die there when occasion requires. In a Memphis
graveyard is buried a young fellow who perished at the wheel a great
many years ago, in White River, to save the lives of other men. He said
to the captain that if the fire would give him time to reach a sand bar,
some distance away, all could be saved, but that to land against the
bluff bank of the river would be to insure the loss of many lives. He
reached the bar and grounded the boat in shallow water; but by that time
the flames had closed around him, and in escaping through them he was
fatally burned. He had been urged to fly sooner, but had replied as
became a pilot to reply–</p>
<p>‘I will not go. If I go, nobody will be saved; if I stay, no one will
be lost but me. I will stay.’</p>
<p>There were two hundred persons on board, and no life was lost but the
pilot’s. There used to be a monument to this young fellow, in that
Memphis graveyard. While we tarried in Memphis on our down trip, I
started out to look for it, but our time was so brief that I was obliged
to turn back before my object was accomplished.</p>
<p>The tug-boat gossip informed me that Dick Kennet was dead–blown up,
near Memphis, and killed; that several others whom I had known had
fallen in the war–one or two of them shot down at the wheel; that
another and very particular friend, whom I had steered many trips for,
had stepped out of his house in New Orleans, one night years ago, to
collect some money in a remote part of the city, and had never been seen
again–was murdered and thrown into the river, it was thought; that Ben
Thornburgh was dead long ago; also his wild ‘cub’ whom I used to quarrel
with, all through every daylight watch. A heedless, reckless creature he
was, and always in hot water, always in mischief. An Arkansas passenger
brought an enormous bear aboard, one day, and chained him to a life-boat
on the hurricane deck. Thornburgh’s ‘cub’ could not rest till he had
gone there and unchained the bear, to ‘see what he would do.’ He was
promptly gratified. The bear chased him around and around the deck, for
miles and miles, with two hundred eager faces grinning through the
railings for audience, and finally snatched off the lad’s coat-tail and
went into the texas to chew it. The off-watch turned out with alacrity,
and left the bear in sole possession. He presently grew lonesome, and
started out for recreation. He ranged the whole boat–visited every part
of it, with an advance guard of fleeing people in front of him and a
voiceless vacancy behind him; and when his owner captured him at last,
those two were the only visible beings anywhere; everybody else was in
hiding, and the boat was a solitude.</p>
<p>I was told that one of my pilot friends fell dead at the wheel, from
heart disease, in 1869. The captain was on the roof at the time. He saw
the boat breaking for the shore; shouted, and got no answer; ran up, and
found the pilot lying dead on the floor.</p>
<p>Mr. Bixby had been blown up, in Madrid bend; was not injured, but the
other pilot was lost.</p>
<p>George Ritchie had been blown up near Memphis–blown into the river
from the wheel, and disabled. The water was very cold; he clung to a
cotton bale–mainly with his teeth–and floated until nearly exhausted,
when he was rescued by some deck hands who were on a piece of the wreck.
They tore open the bale and packed him in the cotton, and warmed the
life back into him, and got him safe to Memphis. He is one of Bixby’s
pilots on the ‘Baton Rouge’ now.</p>
<p>Into the life of a steamboat clerk, now dead, had dropped a bit of
romance–somewhat grotesque romance, but romance nevertheless. When I
knew him he was a shiftless young spendthrift, boisterous, goodhearted,
full of careless generosities, and pretty conspicuously promising to
fool his possibilities away early, and come to nothing. In a Western
city lived a rich and childless old foreigner and his wife; and in their
family was a comely young girl–sort of friend, sort of servant. The
young clerk of whom I have been speaking–whose name was not George
Johnson, but who shall be called George Johnson for the purposes of this
narrative–got acquainted with this young girl, and they sinned; and the
old foreigner found them out, and rebuked them. Being ashamed, they
lied, and said they were married; that they had been privately married.
Then the old foreigner’s hurt was healed, and he forgave and blessed
them. After that, they were able to continue their sin without
concealment. By-and-bye the foreigner’s wife died; and presently he
followed after her. Friends of the family assembled to mourn; and among
the mourners sat the two young sinners. The will was opened and solemnly
read. It bequeathed every penny of that old man’s great wealth to MRS.
GEORGE JOHNSON!</p>
<p>And there was no such person. The young sinners fled forth then, and
did a very foolish thing: married themselves before an obscure Justice
of the Peace, and got him to antedate the thing. That did no sort of
good. The distant relatives flocked in and exposed the fraudful date
with extreme suddenness and surprising ease, and carried off the
fortune, leaving the Johnsons very legitimately, and legally, and
irrevocably chained together in honorable marriage, but with not so much
as a penny to bless themselves withal. Such are the actual facts; and
not all novels have for a base so telling a situation.</p>
