<h4 id="chapter-xxxii.">CHAPTER XXXII.</h4>
<p>The man with a new idea is a Crank until the idea succeeds.
–Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>It was Junior England all the way to Christchurch–in fact, just a
garden. And Christchurch is an English town, with an English-park annex,
and a winding English brook just like the Avon–and named the Avon; but
from a man, not from Shakespeare’s river. Its grassy banks are bordered
by the stateliest and most impressive weeping willows to be found in the
world, I suppose. They continue the line of a great ancestor; they were
grown from sprouts of the willow that sheltered Napoleon’s grave in
St. Helena. It is a settled old community, with all the serenities, the
graces, the conveniences, and the comforts of the ideal home-life. If it
had an established Church and social inequality it would be England over
again with hardly a lack.</p>
<p>In the museum we saw many curious and interesting things; among
others a fine native house of the olden time, with all the details true
to the facts, and the showy colors right and in their proper places. All
the details: the fine mats and rugs and things; the elaborate and
wonderful wood carvings–wonderful, surely, considering who did them
wonderful in design and particularly in execution, for they were done
with admirable sharpness and exactness, and yet with no better tools
than flint and jade and shell could furnish; and the totem-posts were
there, ancestor above ancestor, with tongues protruded and hands clasped
comfortably over bellies containing other people’s ancestors–grotesque
and ugly devils, every one, but lovingly carved, and ably; and the
stuffed natives were present, in their proper places, and looking as
natural as life; and the housekeeping utensils were there, too, and
close at hand the carved and finely ornamented war canoe.</p>
<p>And we saw little jade gods, to hang around the neck–not everybody’s,
but sacred to the necks of natives of rank. Also jade weapons, and many
kinds of jade trinkets–all made out of that excessively hard stone
without the help of any tool of iron. And some of these things had small
round holes bored through them–nobody knows how it was done; a mystery,
a lost art. I think it was said that if you want such a hole bored in a
piece of jade now, you must send it to London or Amsterdam where the
lapidaries are.</p>
<p>Also we saw a complete skeleton of the giant Moa. It stood ten feet
high, and must have been a sight to look at when it was a living bird.
It was a kicker, like the ostrich; in fight it did not use its beak, but
its foot. It must have been a convincing kind of kick. If a person had
his back to the bird and did not see who it was that did it, he would
think he had been kicked by a wind-mill.</p>
<p>There must have been a sufficiency of moas in the old forgotten days
when his breed walked the earth. His bones are found in vast masses, all
crammed together in huge graves. They are not in caves, but in the
ground. Nobody knows how they happened to get concentrated there. Mind,
they are bones, not fossils. This means that the moa has not been
extinct very long. Still, this is the only New Zealand creature which
has no mention in that otherwise comprehensive literature, the native
legends. This is a significant detail, and is good circumstantial
evidence that the moa has been extinct 500 years, since the Maori has
himself–by tradition–been in New Zealand since the end of the fifteenth
century. He came from an unknown land–the first Maori did–then sailed
back in his canoe and brought his tribe, and they removed the aboriginal
peoples into the sea and into the ground and took the land. That is the
tradition. That that first Maori could come, is understandable, for
anybody can come to a place when he isn’t trying to; but how that
discoverer found his way back home again without a compass is his
secret, and he died with it in him. His language indicates that he came
from Polynesia. He told where he came from, but he couldn’t spell well,
so one can’t find the place on the map, because people who could spell
better than he could, spelt the resemblance all out of it when they made
the map. However, it is better to have a map that is spelt right than
one that has information in it.</p>
<p>In New Zealand women have the right to vote for members of the
legislature, but they cannot be members themselves. The law extending
the suffrage to them event into effect in 1893. The population of
Christchurch (census of 1891) was 31,454. The first election under the
law was held in November of that year. Number of men who voted, 6,313;
number of women who voted, 5,989. These figures ought to convince us
that women are not as indifferent about politics as some people would
have us believe. In New Zealand as a whole, the estimated adult female
population was 139,915; of these 109,461 qualified and registered their
names on the rolls 78.23 per cent. of the whole. Of these, 90,290 went
to the polls and voted–85.18 per cent. Do men ever turn out better than
that–in America or elsewhere? Here is a remark to the other sex’s
credit, too–I take it from the official report:</p>
<p>“A feature of the election was the orderliness and sobriety of the
people. Women were in no way molested.“</p>
<p>At home, a standing argument against woman suffrage has always been
that women could not go to the polls without being insulted. The
arguments against woman suffrage have always taken the easy form of
prophecy. The prophets have been prophesying ever since the woman’s
rights movement began in 1848–and in forty-seven years they have never
scored a hit.</p>
<p>Men ought to begin to feel a sort of respect for their mothers and
wives and sisters by this time. The women deserve a change of attitude
like that, for they have wrought well. In forty-seven years they have
swept an imposingly large number of unfair laws from the statute books
of America. In that brief time these serfs have set themselves free
essentially. Men could not have done so much for themselves in that time
without bloodshed–at least they never have; and that is argument that
they didn’t know how. The women have accomplished a peaceful revolution,
and a very beneficent one; and yet that has not convinced the average
man that they are intelligent, and have courage and energy and
perseverance and fortitude. It takes much to convince the average man of
anything; and perhaps nothing can ever make him realize that he is the
average woman’s inferior–yet in several important details the evidences
seems to show that that is what he is. Man has ruled the human race from
the beginning–but he should remember that up to the middle of the
present century it was a dull world, and ignorant and stupid; but it is
not such a dull world now, and is growing less and less dull all the
time. This is woman’s opportunity–she has had none before. I wonder
where man will be in another forty-seven years?</p>
<p>In the New Zealand law occurs this: “The word person wherever it
occurs throughout the Act includes woman.“</p>
<p>That is promotion, you see. By that enlargement of the word, the
matron with the garnered wisdom and experience of fifty years becomes at
one jump the political equal of her callow kid of twenty-one. The white
population of the colony is 626,000, the Maori population is 42,000. The
whites elect seventy members of the House of Representatives, the Maoris
four. The Maori women vote for their four members.</p>
<p>November 16. After four pleasant days in Christchurch, we are to
leave at midnight to-night. Mr. Kinsey gave me an ornithorhynchus, and I
am taming it.</p>
<p>Sunday, 17th. Sailed last night in the Flora, from Lyttelton.</p>
<p>So we did. I remember it yet. The people who sailed in the Flora that
night may forget some other things if they live a good while, but they
will not live long, enough to forget that. The Flora is about the
equivalent of a cattle-scow; but when the Union Company find it
inconvenient to keep a contract and lucrative to break it, they smuggle
her into passenger service, and “keep the change.“</p>
<p>They give no notice of their projected depredation; you innocently
buy tickets for the advertised passenger boat, and when you get down to
Lyttelton at midnight, you find that they have substituted the scow.
They have plenty of good boats, but no competition–and that is the
trouble. It is too late now to make other arrangements if you have
engagements ahead.</p>
<p>It is a powerful company, it has a monopoly, and everybody is afraid
of it–including the government’s representative, who stands at the end
of the stage-plank to tally the passengers and see that no boat receives
a greater number than the law allows her to carry. This
conveniently-blind representative saw the scow receive a number which
was far in excess of its privilege, and winked a politic wink and said
nothing. The passengers bore with meekness the cheat which had been put
upon them, and made no complaint.</p>
<p>It was like being at home in America, where abused passengers act in
just the same way. A few days before, the Union Company had discharged a
captain for getting a boat into danger, and had advertised this act as
evidence of its vigilance in looking after the safety of the passengers
–for thugging a captain costs the company nothing, but when opportunity
offered to send this dangerously overcrowded tub to sea and save a
little trouble and a tidy penny by it, it forgot to worry about the
passenger’s safety.</p>
<p>The first officer told me that the Flora was privileged to carry 125
passengers. She must have had all of 200 on board. All the cabins were
full, all the cattle-stalls in the main stable were full, the spaces at
the heads of companionways were full, every inch of floor and table in
the swill-room was packed with sleeping men and remained so until the
place was required for breakfast, all the chairs and benches on the
hurricane deck were occupied, and still there were people who had to
walk about all night!</p>
<p>If the Flora had gone down that night, half of the people on board
would have been wholly without means of escape.</p>
<p>The owners of that boat were not technically guilty of conspiracy to
commit murder, but they were morally guilty of it.</p>
<p>I had a cattle-stall in the main stable–a cavern fitted up with a
long double file of two-storied bunks, the files separated by a calico
partition–twenty men and boys on one side of it, twenty women and girls
on the other. The place was as dark as the soul of the Union Company,
and smelt like a kennel. When the vessel got out into the heavy seas and
began to pitch and wallow, the cavern prisoners became immediately
seasick, and then the peculiar results that ensued laid all my previous
experiences of the kind well away in the shade. And the wails, the
groans, the cries, the shrieks, the strange ejaculations–it was
wonderful.</p>
<p>The women and children and some of the men and boys spent the night
in that place, for they were too ill to leave it; but the rest of us got
up, by and by, and finished the night on the hurricane-deck.</p>
<p>That boat was the foulest I was ever in; and the smell of the
breakfast saloon when we threaded our way among the layers of steaming
passengers stretched upon its floor and its tables was incomparable for
efficiency.</p>
<p>A good many of us got ashore at the first way-port to seek another
ship. After a wait of three hours we got good rooms in the Mahinapua, a
wee little bridal-parlor of a boat–only 205 tons burthen; clean and
comfortable; good service; good beds; good table, and no crowding. The
seas danced her about like a duck, but she was safe and capable.</p>
<p>Next morning early she went through the French Pass–a narrow gateway
of rock, between bold headlands–so narrow, in fact, that it seemed no
wider than a street. The current tore through there like a mill-race,
and the boat darted through like a telegram. The passage was made in
half a minute; then we were in a wide place where noble vast eddies
swept grandly round and round in shoal water, and I wondered what they
would do with the little boat. They did as they pleased with her. They
picked her up and flung her around like nothing and landed her gently on
the solid, smooth bottom of sand–so gently, indeed, that we barely felt
her touch it, barely felt her quiver when she came to a standstill. The
water was as clear as glass, the sand on the bottom was vividly
distinct, and the fishes seemed to be swimming about in nothing. Fishing
lines were brought out, but before we could bait the hooks the boat was
off and away again.</p>
