<h4 id="chapter-xxvi.">CHAPTER XXVI.</h4>
<p>There are people who can do all fine and heroic things but one! keep
from telling their happinesses to the unhappy. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New
Calendar.</p>
<p>After visits to Maryborough and some other Australian towns, we
presently took passage for New Zealand. If it would not look too much
like showing off, I would tell the reader where New Zealand is; for he
is as I was; he thinks he knows. And he thinks he knows where
Hertzegovina is; and how to pronounce pariah; and how to use the word
unique without exposing himself to the derision of the dictionary. But
in truth, he knows none of these things. There are but four or five
people in the world who possess this knowledge, and these make their
living out of it. They travel from place to place, visiting literary
assemblages, geographical societies, and seats of learning, and
springing sudden bets that these people do not know these things. Since
all people think they know them, they are an easy prey to these
adventurers. Or rather they were an easy prey until the law interfered,
three months ago, and a New York court decided that this kind of
gambling is illegal, “because it traverses Article IV, Section 9, of the
Constitution of the United States, which forbids betting on a sure
thing.“ This decision was rendered by the full Bench of the New York
Supreme Court, after a test sprung upon the court by counsel for the
prosecution, which showed that none of the nine Judges was able to
answer any of the four questions.</p>
<p>All people think that New Zealand is close to Australia or Asia, or
somewhere, and that you cross to it on a bridge. But that is not so. It
is not close to anything, but lies by itself, out in the water. It is
nearest to Australia, but still not near. The gap between is very wide.
It will be a surprise to the reader, as it was to me, to learn that the
distance from Australia to New Zealand is really twelve or thirteen
hundred miles, and that there is no bridge. I learned this from
Professor X., of Yale University, whom I met in the steamer on the great
lakes when I was crossing the continent to sail across the Pacific. I
asked him about New Zealand, in order to make conversation. I supposed
he would generalize a little without compromising himself, and then turn
the subject to something he was acquainted with, and my object would
then be attained; the ice would be broken, and we could go smoothly on,
and get acquainted, and have a pleasant time. But, to my surprise, he
was not only not embarrassed by my question, but seemed to welcome it,
and to take a distinct interest in it. He began to talk–fluently,
confidently, comfortably; and as he talked, my admiration grew and grew;
for as the subject developed under his hands, I saw that he not only
knew where New Zealand was, but that he was minutely familiar with every
detail of its history, politics, religions, and commerce, its fauna,
flora, geology, products, and climatic peculiarities. When he was done,
I was lost in wonder and admiration, and said to myself, he knows
everything; in the domain of human knowledge he is king.</p>
<p>I wanted to see him do more miracles; and so, just for the pleasure
of hearing him answer, I asked him about Hertzegovina, and pariah, and
unique. But he began to generalize then, and show distress. I saw that
with New Zealand gone, he was a Samson shorn of his locks; he was as
other men. This was a curious and interesting mystery, and I was frank
with him, and asked him to explain it.</p>
<p>He tried to avoid it at first; but then laughed and said that after
all, the matter was not worth concealment, so he would let me into the
secret. In substance, this is his story:</p>
<p>“Last autumn I was at work one morning at home, when a card came
up–the card of a stranger. Under the name was printed a line which
showed that this visitor was Professor of Theological Engineering in
Wellington University, New Zealand. I was troubled–troubled, I mean, by
the shortness of the notice. College etiquette required that he be at
once invited to dinner by some member of the Faculty–invited to dine on
that day–not, put off till a subsequent day. I did not quite know what
to do. College etiquette requires, in the case of a foreign guest, that
the dinner-talk shall begin with complimentary references to his
country, its great men, its services to civilization, its seats of
learning, and things like that; and of course the host is responsible,
and must either begin this talk himself or see that it is done by some
one else. I was in great difficulty; and the more I searched my memory,
the more my trouble grew. I found that I knew nothing about New Zealand.
I thought I knew where it was, and that was all. I had an impression
that it was close to Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and that one went
over to it on a bridge. This might turn out to be incorrect; and even if
correct, it would not furnish matter enough for the purpose at the
dinner, and I should expose my College to shame before my guest; he
would see that I, a member of the Faculty of the first University in
America, was wholly ignorant of his country, and he would go away and
tell this, and laugh at it. The thought of it made my face burn.</p>
<p>“I sent for my wife and told her how I was situated, and asked for
her help, and she thought of a thing which I might have thought of
myself, if I had not been excited and worried. She said she would go and
tell the visitor that I was out but would be in in a few minutes; and
she would talk, and keep him busy while I got out the back way and
hurried over and make Professor Lawson give the dinner. For Lawson knew
everything, and could meet the guest in a creditable way and save the
reputation of the University. I ran to Lawson, but was disappointed. He
did not know anything about New Zealand. He said that, as far as his
recollection went it was close to Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and
you go over to it on a bridge; but that was all he knew. It was too bad.
Lawson was a perfect encyclopedia of abstruse learning; but now in this
hour of our need, it turned out that he did not know any useful
thing.</p>
<p>“We consulted. He saw that the reputation of the University was in
very real peril, and he walked the floor in anxiety, talking, and trying
to think out some way to meet the difficulty. Presently he decided that
we must try the rest of the Faculty–some of them might know about New
Zealand. So we went to the telephone and called up the professor of
astronomy and asked him, and he said that all he knew was, that it was
close to Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and you went over to it
on—-</p>
<p>“We shut him off and called up the professor of biology, and he said
that all he knew was that it was close to Aus—-.</p>
<p>“We shut him off, and sat down, worried and disheartened, to see if
we could think up some other scheme. We shortly hit upon one which
promised well, and this one we adopted, and set its machinery going at
once. It was this. Lawson must give the dinner. The Faculty must be
notified by telephone to prepare. We must all get to work diligently,
and at the end of eight hours and a half we must come to dinner
acquainted with New Zealand; at least well enough informed to appear
without discredit before this native. To seem properly intelligent we
should have to know about New Zealand’s population, and politics, and
form of government, and commerce, and taxes, and products, and ancient
history, and modern history, and varieties of religion, and nature of
the laws, and their codification, and amount of revenue, and whence
drawn, and methods of collection, and percentage of loss, and character
of climate, and–well, a lot of things like that; we must suck the maps
and cyclopedias dry. And while we posted up in this way, the Faculty’s
wives must flock over, one after the other, in a studiedly casual way,
and help my wife keep the New Zealander quiet, and not let him get out
and come interfering with our studies. The scheme worked admirably; but
it stopped business, stopped it entirely.</p>
<p>“It is in the official log-book of Yale, to be read and wondered at
by future generations–the account of the Great Blank Day–the memorable
Blank Day–the day wherein the wheels of culture were stopped, a Sunday
silence prevailed all about, and the whole University stood still while
the Faculty read-up and qualified itself to sit at meat, without shame,
in the presence of the Professor of Theological Engineering from New
Zealand:</p>
<p>“When we assembled at the dinner we were miserably tired and worn–but
we were posted. Yes, it is fair to claim that. In fact, erudition is a
pale name for it. New Zealand was the only subject; and it was just
beautiful to hear us ripple it out. And with such an air of
unembarrassed ease, and unostentatious familiarity with detail, and
trained and seasoned mastery of the subject-and oh, the grace and
fluency of it!</p>
<p>“Well, finally somebody happened to notice that the guest was looking
dazed, and wasn’t saying anything. So they stirred him up, of course.
Then that man came out with a good, honest, eloquent compliment that
made the Faculty blush. He said he was not worthy to sit in the company
of men like these; that he had been silent from admiration; that he had
been silent from another cause also–silent from shame–silent from
ignorance! ‘For,’ said he, ‘I, who have lived eighteen years in New
Zealand and have served five in a professorship, and ought to know much
about that country, perceive, now, that I know almost nothing about it.
I say it with shame, that I have learned fifty times, yes, a hundred
times more about New Zealand in these two hours at this table than I
ever knew before in all the eighteen years put together. I was silent
because I could not help myself. What I knew about taxes, and policies,
and laws, and revenue, and products, and history, and all that multitude
of things, was but general, and ordinary, and vague-unscientific, in a
word–and it would have been insanity to expose it here to the searching
glare of your amazingly accurate and all-comprehensive knowledge of
those matters, gentlemen. I beg you to let me sit silent–as becomes me.
But do not change the subject; I can at least follow you, in this one;
whereas if you change to one which shall call out the full strength of
your mighty erudition, I shall be as one lost. If you know all this
about a remote little inconsequent patch like New Zealand, ah, what
wouldn’t you know about any other Subject!’“</p>
