<h4 id="honored-as-a-curiosity">HONORED AS A CURIOSITY</h4>
<p>If you get into conversation with a stranger in Honolulu, and
experience that natural desire to know what sort of ground you are
treading on by finding out what manner of man your stranger is, strike
out boldly and address him as “Captain.“ Watch him narrowly, and if you
see by his countenance that you are on the wrong track, ask him where he
preaches. It is a safe bet that he is either a missionary or captain of
a whaler. I became personally acquainted with seventy-two captains and
ninety-six missionaries. The captains and ministers form one-half of the
population; the third fourth is composed of common Kanakas and
mercantile foreigners and their families; and the final fourth is made
up of high officers of the Hawaiian Government. And there are just about
cats enough for three apiece all around.</p>
<p>A solemn stranger met me in the suburbs one day, and said:</p>
<p>“Good morning, your reverence. Preach in the stone church yonder, no
doubt!“</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. I’m not a preacher.“</p>
<p>“Really, I beg your pardon, captain. I trust you had a good season.
How much oil–“</p>
<p>“Oil! Why, what do you take me for? I’m not a whaler.“</p>
<p>“Oh! I beg a thousand pardons, your Excellency. Major-General in the
household troops, no doubt? Minister of the Interior, likely? Secretary
of War? First Gentleman of the Bedchamber? Commissioner of the
Royal–“</p>
<p>“Stuff, man! I’m not connected in any way with the government.“</p>
<p>“Bless my life! Then who the mischief are you? what the mischief are
you? and how the mischief did you get here? and where in thunder did you
come from?“</p>
<p>“I’m only a private personage–an unassuming stranger–lately arrived
from America.“</p>
<p>“No! Not a missionary! not a whaler! not a member of his Majesty’s
government! not even a Secretary of the Navy! Ah! Heaven! it is too
blissful to be true, alas! I do but dream. And yet that noble, honest
countenance–those oblique, ingenuous eyes–that massive head, incapable
of–of anything; your hand; give me your hand, bright waif. Excuse these
tears. For sixteen weary years I have yearned for a moment like this,
and–“</p>
<p>Here his feelings were too much for him, and he swooned away. I
pitied this poor creature from the bottom of my heart. I was deeply
moved. I shed a few tears on him, and kissed him for his mother. I then
took what small change he had, and “shoved.“</p>
<p>FIRST INTERVIEW WITH ARTEMUS WARD–[Written about 1870.]</p>
<p>I had never seen him before. He brought letters of introduction from
mutual friends in San Francisco, and by invitation I breakfasted with
him. It was almost religion, there in the silver-mines, to precede such
a meal with whisky cocktails. Artemus, with the true cosmopolitan
instinct, always deferred to the customs of the country he was in, and
so he ordered three of those abominations. Hingston was present. I said
I would rather not drink a whisky cocktail. I said it would go right to
my head, and confuse me so that I would be in a helpless tangle in ten
minutes. I did not want to act like a lunatic before strangers. But
Artemus gently insisted, and I drank the treasonable mixture under
protest, and felt all the time that I was doing a thing I might be sorry
for. In a minute or two I began to imagine that my ideas were clouded. I
waited in great anxiety for the conversation to open, with a sort of
vague hope that my understanding would prove clear, after all, and my
misgivings groundless.</p>
<p>Artemus dropped an unimportant remark or two, and then assumed a look
of superhuman earnestness, and made the following astounding speech. He
said:</p>
<p>“Now there is one thing I ought to ask you about before I forget it.
You have been here in Silver land–here in Nevada–two or three years,
and, of course, your position on the daily press has made it necessary
for you to go down in the mines and examine them carefully in detail,
and therefore you know all about the silver-mining business. Now what I
want to get at is–is, well, the way the deposits of ore are made, you
know. For instance. Now, as I understand it, the vein which contains the
silver is sandwiched in between casings of granite, and runs along the
ground, and sticks up like a curb stone. Well, take a vein forty feet
thick, for example, or eighty, for that matter, or even a hundred–say
you go down on it with a shaft, straight down, you know, or with what
you call ‘incline’ maybe you go down five hundred feet, or maybe you
don’t go down but two hundred–anyway, you go down, and all the time this
vein grows narrower, when the casings come nearer or approach each
other, you may say–that is, when they do approach, which, of course,
they do not always do, particularly in cases where the nature of the
formation is such that they stand apart wider than they otherwise would,
and which geology has failed to account for, although everything in that
science goes to prove that, all things being equal, it would if it did
not, or would not certainly if it did, and then, of course, they are. Do
not you think it is?“</p>
<p>I said to myself:</p>
<p>“Now I just knew how it would be–that whisky cocktail has done the
business for me; I don’t understand any more than a clam.“</p>
<p>And then I said aloud:</p>
<p>“I–I–that is–if you don’t mind, would you–would you say that over
again? I ought–“</p>
<p>“Oh, certainly, certainly! You see I am very unfamiliar with the
subject, and perhaps I don’t present my case clearly, but I–“</p>
<p>“No, no-no, no-you state it plain enough, but that cocktail has
muddled me a little. But I will no, I do understand for that matter; but
I would get the hang of it all the better if you went over it again-and
I’ll pay better attention this time.“</p>
<p>He said; “Why, what I was after was this.“</p>
<p>[Here he became even more fearfully impressive than ever, and
emphasized each particular point by checking it off on his
finger-ends.]</p>
<p>“This vein, or lode, or ledge, or whatever you call it, runs along
between two layers of granite, just the same as if it were a sandwich.
Very well. Now suppose you go down on that, say a thousand feet, or
maybe twelve hundred (it don’t really matter) before you drift, and then
you start your drifts, some of them across the ledge, and others along
the length of it, where the sulphurets–I believe they call them
sulphurets, though why they should, considering that, so far as I can
see, the main dependence of a miner does not so lie, as some suppose,
but in which it cannot be successfully maintained, wherein the same
should not continue, while part and parcel of the same ore not committed
to either in the sense referred to, whereas, under different
circumstances, the most inexperienced among us could not detect it if it
were, or might overlook it if it did, or scorn the very idea of such a
thing, even though it were palpably demonstrated as such. Am I not
right?“</p>
<p>I said, sorrowfully: “I feel ashamed of myself, Mr. Ward. I know I
ought to understand you perfectly well, but you see that treacherous
whisky cocktail has got into my head, and now I cannot understand even
the simplest proposition. I told you how it would be.“</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t mind it, don’t mind it; the fault was my own, no
doubt–though I did think it clear enough for–“</p>
<p>“Don’t say a word. Clear! Why, you stated it as clear as the sun to
anybody but an abject idiot; but it’s that confounded cocktail that has
played the mischief.“</p>
<p>“No; now don’t say that. I’ll begin it all over again, and–“</p>
<p>“Don’t now–for goodness’ sake, don’t do anything of the kind, because
I tell you my head is in such a condition that I don’t believe I could
understand the most trifling question a man could ask me.</p>
<p>“Now don’t you be afraid. I’ll put it so plain this time that you
can’t help but get the hang of it. We will begin at the very beginning.“
[Leaning far across the table, with determined impressiveness wrought
upon his every feature, and fingers prepared to keep tally of each point
enumerated; and I, leaning forward with painful interest, resolved to
comprehend or perish.] “You know the vein, the ledge, the thing that
contains the metal, whereby it constitutes the medium between all other
forces, whether of present or remote agencies, so brought to bear in
favor of the former against the latter, or the latter against the former
or all, or both, or compromising the relative differences existing
within the radius whence culminate the several degrees of similarity to
which–“</p>
<p>I said: “Oh, hang my wooden head, it ain’t any use!–it ain’t any use
to try–I can’t understand anything. The plainer you get it the more I
can’t get the hang of it.“</p>
<p>I heard a suspicious noise behind me, and turned in time to see
Hingston dodging behind a newspaper, and quaking with a gentle ecstasy
of laughter. I looked at Ward again, and he had thrown off his dread
solemnity and was laughing also. Then I saw that I had been sold–that I
had been made a victim of a swindle in the way of a string of plausibly
worded sentences that didn’t mean anything under the sun. Artemus Ward
was one of the best fellows in the world, and one of the most
companionable. It has been said that he was not fluent in conversation,
but, with the above experience in my mind, I differ.</p>
<p>CANNIBALISM IN THE CARS–[Written abort 1867.]</p>
<p>I visited St. Louis lately, and on my way West, after changing cars
at Terre Haute, Indiana, a mild, benevolent-looking gentleman of about
forty-five, or maybe fifty, came in at one of the way-stations and sat
down beside me. We talked together pleasantly on various subjects for an
hour, perhaps, and I found him exceedingly intelligent and entertaining.
When he learned that I was from Washington, he immediately began to ask
questions about various public men, and about Congressional affairs; and
I saw very shortly that I was conversing with a man who was perfectly
familiar with the ins and outs of political life at the Capital, even to
the ways and manners, and customs of procedure of Senators and
Representatives in the Chambers of the national Legislature. Presently
two men halted near us for a single moment, and one said to the
other:</p>
<p>“Harris, if you’ll do that for me, I’ll never forget you, my
boy.“</p>
<p>My new comrade’s eye lighted pleasantly. The words had touched upon a
happy memory, I thought. Then his face settled into thoughtfulness
–almost into gloom. He turned to me and said,</p>
<p>“Let me tell you a story; let me give you a secret chapter of my life
–a chapter that has never been referred to by me since its events
transpired. Listen patiently, and promise that you will not interrupt
me.“</p>
<p>I said I would not, and he related the following strange adventure,
speaking sometimes with animation, sometimes with melancholy, but always
with feeling and earnestness.</p>
<p>THE STRANGER’S NARRATIVE</p>
<p>“On the 19th of December, 1853, I started from St. Louis on the
evening train bound for Chicago. There were only twenty-four passengers,
all told. There were no ladies and no children. We were in excellent
spirits, and pleasant acquaintanceships were soon formed. The journey
bade fair to be a happy one; and no individual in the party, I think,
had even the vaguest presentiment of the horrors we were soon to
undergo.</p>
<p>“At 11 P.m. it began to snow hard. Shortly after leaving the small
village of Welden, we entered upon that tremendous prairie solitude that
stretches its leagues on leagues of houseless dreariness far away toward
the jubilee Settlements. The winds, unobstructed by trees or hills, or
even vagrant rocks, whistled fiercely across the level desert, driving
the falling snow before it like spray from the crested waves of a stormy
sea. The snow was deepening fast; and we knew, by the diminished speed
of the train, that the engine was plowing through it with steadily
increasing difficulty. Indeed, it almost came to a dead halt sometimes,
in the midst of great drifts that piled themselves like colossal graves
across the track. Conversation began to flag. Cheerfulness gave place to
grave concern. The possibility of being imprisoned in the snow, on the
bleak prairie, fifty miles from any house, presented itself to every
mind, and extended its depressing influence over every spirit.</p>
<p>“At two o’clock in the morning I was aroused out of an uneasy slumber
by the ceasing of all motion about me. The appalling truth flashed upon
me instantly–we were captives in a snow-drift! ‘All hands to the
rescue!’ Every man sprang to obey. Out into the wild night, the pitchy
darkness, the billowy snow, the driving storm, every soul leaped, with
the consciousness that a moment lost now might bring destruction to us
all. Shovels, hands, boards–anything, everything that could displace
snow, was brought into instant requisition. It was a weird picture, that
small company of frantic men fighting the banking snows, half in the
blackest shadow and half in the angry light of the locomotive’s
reflector.</p>
<p>“One short hour sufficed to prove the utter uselessness of our
efforts. The storm barricaded the track with a dozen drifts while we dug
one away. And worse than this, it was discovered that the last grand
charge the engine had made upon the enemy had broken the fore-and-aft
shaft of the driving-wheel! With a free track before us we should still
have been helpless. We entered the car wearied with labor, and very
sorrowful. We gathered about the stoves, and gravely canvassed our
situation. We had no provisions whatever–in this lay our chief distress.
We could not freeze, for there was a good supply of wood in the tender.
This was our only comfort. The discussion ended at last in accepting the
disheartening decision of the conductor, viz., that it would be death
for any man to attempt to travel fifty miles on foot through snow like
that. We could not send for help, and even if we could it would not
come. We must submit, and await, as patiently as we might, succor or
starvation! I think the stoutest heart there felt a momentary chill when
those words were uttered.</p>
<p>“Within the hour conversation subsided to a low murmur here and there
about the car, caught fitfully between the rising and falling of the
blast; the lamps grew dim; and the majority of the castaways settled
themselves among the flickering shadows to think–to forget the present,
if they could–to sleep, if they might.</p>
<p>“The eternal night-it surely seemed eternal to us-wore its lagging
hours away at last, and the cold gray dawn broke in the east. As the
light grew stronger the passengers began to stir and give signs of life,
one after another, and each in turn pushed his slouched hat up from his
forehead, stretched his stiffened limbs, and glanced out of the windows
upon the cheerless prospect. It was cheer less, indeed!-not a living
thing visible anywhere, not a human habitation; nothing but a vast white
desert; uplifted sheets of snow drifting hither and thither before the
wind–a world of eddying flakes shutting out the firmament above.</p>
<p>“All day we moped about the cars, saying little, thinking much.
Another lingering dreary night–and hunger.</p>
<p>“Another dawning–another day of silence, sadness, wasting hunger,
hopeless watching for succor that could not come. A night of restless
slumber, filled with dreams of feasting–wakings distressed with the
gnawings of hunger.</p>
<p>“The fourth day came and went–and the fifth! Five days of dreadful
imprisonment! A savage hunger looked out at every eye. There was in it a
sign of awful import–the foreshadowing of a something that was vaguely
shaping itself in every heart–a something which no tongue dared yet to
frame into words.</p>
<p>“The sixth day passed–the seventh dawned upon as gaunt and haggard
and hopeless a company of men as ever stood in the shadow of death. It
must out now! That thing which had been growing up in every heart was
ready to leap from every lip at last! Nature had been taxed to the
utmost–she must yield. RICHARD H. GASTON of Minnesota, tall, cadaverous,
and pale, rose up. All knew what was coming. All prepared–every emotion,
every semblance of excitement–was smothered–only a calm, thoughtful
seriousness appeared in the eyes that were lately so wild.</p>
<p>“‘Gentlemen: It cannot be delayed longer! The time is at hand! We
must determine which of us shall die to furnish food for the rest!’</p>
<p>“MR. JOHN J. WILLIAMS of Illinois rose and said: ‘Gentlemen–I
nominate the Rev. James Sawyer of Tennessee.’</p>
<p>“MR. Wm. R. ADAMS of Indiana said: ‘I nominate Mr. Daniel Slote of
New York.’</p>
<p>“MR. CHARLES J. LANGDON: ‘I nominate Mr. Samuel A. Bowen of
St. Louis.’</p>
<p>“MR. SLOTE: ‘Gentlemen–I desire to decline in favor of Mr. John A.
Van Nostrand, Jun., of New Jersey.’</p>
<p>“MR. GASTON: ‘If there be no objection, the gentleman’s desire will
be acceded to.’</p>
<p>“MR. VAN NOSTRAND objecting, the resignation of Mr. Slote was
rejected. The resignations of Messrs. Sawyer and Bowen were also
offered, and refused upon the same grounds.</p>
<p>“MR. A. L. BASCOM of Ohio: ‘I move that the nominations now close,
and that the House proceed to an election by ballot.’</p>
<p>“MR. SAWYER: ‘Gentlemen–I protest earnestly against these
proceedings. They are, in every way, irregular and unbecoming. I must
beg to move that they be dropped at once, and that we elect a chairman
of the meeting and proper officers to assist him, and then we can go on
with the business before us understandingly.’</p>
<p>“MR. BELL of Iowa: ‘Gentlemen–I object. This is no time to stand upon
forms and ceremonious observances. For more than seven days we have been
without food. Every moment we lose in idle discussion increases our
distress. I am satisfied with the nominations that have been made–every
gentleman present is, I believe–and I, for one, do not see why we should
not proceed at once to elect one or more of them. I wish to offer a
resolution–’</p>
<p>“MR. GASTON: ‘It would be objected to, and have to lie over one day
under the rules, thus bringing about the very delay you wish to avoid.
The gentleman from New Jersey–’</p>
<p>“MR. VAN NOSTRAND: ‘Gentlemen–I am a stranger among you; I have not
sought the distinction that has been conferred upon me, and I feel a
delicacy–’</p>
<p>“MR. MORGAN Of Alabama (interrupting): ‘I move the previous
question.’</p>
<p>“The motion was carried, and further debate shut off, of course. The
motion to elect officers was passed, and under it Mr. Gaston was chosen
chairman, Mr. Blake, secretary, Messrs. Holcomb, Dyer, and Baldwin a
committee on nominations, and Mr. R. M. Howland, purveyor, to assist the
committee in making selections.</p>
<p>“A recess of half an hour was then taken, and some little caucusing
followed. At the sound of the gavel the meeting reassembled, and the
committee reported in favor of Messrs. George Ferguson of Kentucky,
Lucien Herrman of Louisiana, and W. Messick of Colorado as candidates.
The report was accepted.</p>
<p>“MR. ROGERS of Missouri: ‘Mr. President The report being properly
before the House now, I move to amend it by substituting for the name of
Mr. Herrman that of Mr. Lucius Harris of St. Louis, who is well and
honorably known to us all. I do not wish to be understood as casting the
least reflection upon the high character and standing of the gentleman
from Louisiana far from it. I respect and esteem him as much as any
gentleman here present possibly can; but none of us can be blind to the
fact that he has lost more flesh during the week that we have lain here
than any among us–none of us can be blind to the fact that the committee
has been derelict in its duty, either through negligence or a graver
fault, in thus offering for our suffrages a gentleman who, however pure
his own motives may be, has really less nutriment in him–’</p>
<p>“THE CHAIR: ‘The gentleman from Missouri will take his seat. The
Chair cannot allow the integrity of the committee to be questioned save
by the regular course, under the rules. What action will the House take
upon the gentleman’s motion?’</p>
<p>“MR. HALLIDAY of Virginia: ‘I move to further amend the report by
substituting Mr. Harvey Davis of Oregon for Mr. Messick. It may be urged
by gentlemen that the hardships and privations of a frontier life have
rendered Mr. Davis tough; but, gentlemen, is this a time to cavil at
toughness? Is this a time to be fastidious concerning trifles? Is this a
time to dispute about matters of paltry significance? No, gentlemen,
bulk is what we desire–substance, weight, bulk–these are the supreme
requisites now–not talent, not genius, not education. I insist upon my
motion.’</p>
<p>“MR. MORGAN (excitedly): ‘Mr. Chairman–I do most strenuously object
to this amendment. The gentleman from Oregon is old, and furthermore is
bulky only in bone–not in flesh. I ask the gentleman from Virginia if it
is soup we want instead of solid sustenance? if he would delude us with
shadows? if he would mock our suffering with an Oregonian specter? I ask
him if he can look upon the anxious faces around him, if he can gaze
into our sad eyes, if he can listen to the beating of our expectant
hearts, and still thrust this famine-stricken fraud upon us? I ask him
if he can think of our desolate state, of our past sorrows, of our dark
future, and still unpityingly foist upon us this wreck, this ruin, this
tottering swindle, this gnarled and blighted and sapless vagabond from
Oregon’s hospitable shores? Never!’ [Applause.]</p>
<p>“The amendment was put to vote, after a fiery debate, and lost.
Mr. Harris was substituted on the first amendment. The balloting then
began. Five ballots were held without a choice. On the sixth, Mr. Harris
was elected, all voting for him but himself. It was then moved that his
election should be ratified by acclamation, which was lost, in
consequence of his again voting against himself.</p>
<p>“MR. RADWAY moved that the House now take up the remaining
candidates, and go into an election for breakfast. This was carried.</p>
<p>“On the first ballot–there was a tie, half the members favoring one
candidate on account of his youth, and half favoring the other on
account of his superior size. The President gave the casting vote for
the latter, Mr. Messick. This decision created considerable
dissatisfaction among the friends of Mr. Ferguson, the defeated
candidate, and there was some talk of demanding a new ballot; but in the
midst of it a motion to adjourn was carried, and the meeting broke up at
once.</p>
<p>“The preparations for supper diverted the attention of the Ferguson
faction from the discussion of their grievance for a long time, and
then, when they would have taken it up again, the happy announcement
that Mr. Harris was ready drove all thought of it to the winds.</p>
<p>“We improvised tables by propping up the backs of car-seats, and sat
down with hearts full of gratitude to the finest supper that had blessed
our vision for seven torturing days. How changed we were from what we
had been a few short hours before! Hopeless, sad-eyed misery, hunger,
feverish anxiety, desperation, then; thankfulness, serenity, joy too
deep for utterance now. That I know was the cheeriest hour of my
eventful life. The winds howled, and blew the snow wildly about our
prison house, but they were powerless to distress us any more. I liked
Harris. He might have been better done, perhaps, but I am free to say
that no man ever agreed with me better than Harris, or afforded me so
large a degree of satisfaction. Messick was very well, though rather
high-flavored, but for genuine nutritiousness and delicacy of fiber,
give me Harris. Messick had his good points–I will not attempt to deny
it, nor do I wish to do it but he was no more fitted for breakfast than
a mummy would be, sir–not a bit. Lean?–why, bless me!–and tough? Ah, he
was very tough! You could not imagine it–you could never imagine
anything like it.“</p>
<p>“Do you mean to tell me that–“</p>
<p>“Do not interrupt me, please. After breakfast we elected a man by the
name of Walker, from Detroit, for supper. He was very good. I wrote his
wife so afterward. He was worthy of all praise. I shall always remember
Walker. He was a little rare, but very good. And then the next morning
we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I
ever sat down to handsome, educated, refined, spoke several languages
fluently a perfect gentleman he was a perfect gentleman, and singularly
juicy. For supper we had that Oregon patriarch, and he was a fraud,
there is no question about it–old, scraggy, tough, nobody can picture
the reality. I finally said, gentlemen, you can do as you like, but I
will wait for another election. And Grimes of Illinois said, ‘Gentlemen,
I will wait also. When you elect a man that has something to recommend
him, I shall be glad to join you again.’ It soon became evident that
there was general dissatisfaction with Davis of Oregon, and so, to
preserve the good will that had prevailed so pleasantly since we had had
Harris, an election was called, and the result of it was that Baker of
Georgia was chosen. He was splendid! Well, well–after that we had
Doolittle, and Hawkins, and McElroy (there was some complaint about
McElroy, because he was uncommonly short and thin), and Penrod, and two
Smiths, and Bailey (Bailey had a wooden leg, which was clear loss, but
he was otherwise good), and an Indian boy, and an organ-grinder, and a
gentleman by the name of Buckminster–a poor stick of a vagabond that
wasn’t any good for company and no account for breakfast. We were glad
we got him elected before relief came.“</p>
<p>“And so the blessed relief did come at last?“</p>
<p>“Yes, it came one bright, sunny morning, just after election. John
Murphy was the choice, and there never was a better, I am willing to
testify; but John Murphy came home with us, in the train that came to
succor us, and lived to marry the widow Harris–“</p>
<p>“Relict of–“</p>
<p>“Relict of our first choice. He married her, and is happy and
respected and prosperous yet. Ah, it was like a novel, sir–it was like a
romance. This is my stopping-place, sir; I must bid you goodby. Any time
that you can make it convenient to tarry a day or two with me, I shall
be glad to have you. I like you, sir; I have conceived an affection for
you. I could like you as well as I liked Harris himself, sir. Good day,
sir, and a pleasant journey.“</p>
<p>He was gone. I never felt so stunned, so distressed, so bewildered in
my life. But in my soul I was glad he was gone. With all his gentleness
of manner and his soft voice, I shuddered whenever he turned his hungry
eye upon me; and when I heard that I had achieved his perilous
affection, and that I stood almost with the late Harris in his esteem,
my heart fairly stood still!</p>
<p>I was bewildered beyond description. I did not doubt his word; I
could not question a single item in a statement so stamped with the
earnestness of truth as his; but its dreadful details overpowered me,
and threw my thoughts into hopeless confusion. I saw the conductor
looking at me. I said, “Who is that man?“</p>
<p>“He was a member of Congress once, and a good one. But he got caught
in a snow-drift in the cars, and like to have been starved to death. He
got so frost-bitten and frozen up generally, and used up for want of
something to eat, that he was sick and out of his head two or three
months afterward. He is all right now, only he is a monomaniac, and when
he gets on that old subject he never stops till he has eat up that whole
car-load of people he talks about. He would have finished the crowd by
this time, only he had to get out here. He has got their names as pat as
A B C. When he gets them all eat up but himself, he always says: ‘Then
the hour for the usual election for breakfast having arrived; and there
being no opposition, I was duly elected, after which, there being no
objections offered, I resigned. Thus I am here.’“</p>
<p>I felt inexpressibly relieved to know that I had only been listening
to the harmless vagaries of a madman instead of the genuine experiences
of a bloodthirsty cannibal.</p>
<p>THE KILLING OF JULIUS CAESAR “LOCALIZED“–[Written about 1865.]</p>
<p>Being the only true and reliable account ever published; taken from
the Roman “Daily Evening Fasces,“ of the date of that tremendous
occurrence.</p>
<p>Nothing in the world affords a newspaper reporter so much
satisfaction as gathering up the details of a bloody and mysterious
murder and writing them up with aggravating circumstantiality. He takes
a living delight in this labor of love–for such it is to him, especially
if he knows that all the other papers have gone to press, and his will
be the only one that will contain the dreadful intelligence. A feeling
of regret has often come over me that I was not reporting in Rome when
Caesar was killed–reporting on an evening paper, and the only one in the
city, and getting at least twelve hours ahead of the morning-paper boys
with this most magnificent “item“ that ever fell to the lot of the
craft. Other events have happened as startling as this, but none that
possessed so peculiarly all the characteristics of the favorite “item“
of the present day, magnified into grandeur and sublimity by the high
rank, fame, and social and political standing of the actors in it.</p>
<p>However, as I was not permitted to report Caesar’s assassination in
the regular way, it has at least afforded me rare satisfaction to
translate the following able account of it from the original Latin of
the Roman Daily Evening Fasces of that date–second edition:</p>
<p>Our usually quiet city of Rome was thrown into a state of wild
excitement yesterday by the occurrence of one of those bloody affrays
which sicken the heart and fill the soul with fear, while they inspire
all thinking men with forebodings for the future of a city where human
life is held so cheaply and the gravest laws are so openly set at
defiance. As the result of that affray, it is our painful duty, as
public journalists, to record the death of one of our most esteemed
citizens–a man whose name is known wherever this paper circulates, and
where fame it has been our pleasure and our privilege to extend, and
also to protect from the tongue of slander and falsehood, to the best of
our poor ability. We refer to Mr. J. Caesar, the Emperor-elect.</p>
<p>The facts of the case, as nearly as our reporter could determine them
from the conflicting statements of eye-witnesses, were about as
follows:– The affair was an election row, of course. Nine-tenths of the
ghastly butcheries that disgrace the city nowadays grow out of the
bickerings and jealousies and animosities engendered by these accursed
elections. Rome would be the gainer by it if her very constables were
elected to serve a century; for in our experience we have never even
been able to choose a dog-pelter without celebrating the event with a
dozen knockdowns and a general cramming of the station-house with
drunken vagabonds overnight. It is said that when the immense majority
for Caesar at the polls in the market was declared the other day, and
the crown was offered to that gentleman, even his amazing unselfishness
in refusing it three times was not sufficient to save him from the
whispered insults of such men as Casca, of the Tenth Ward, and other
hirelings of the disappointed candidate, hailing mostly from the
Eleventh and Thirteenth and other outside districts, who were overheard
speaking ironically and contemptuously of Mr. Caesar’s conduct upon that
occasion.</p>
<p>We are further informed that there are many among us who think they
are justified in believing that the assassination of Julius Caesar was a
put-up thing–a cut-and-dried arrangement, hatched by Marcus Brutus and a
lot of his hired roughs, and carried out only too faithfully according
to the program. Whether there be good grounds for this suspicion or not,
we leave to the people to judge for themselves, only asking that they
will read the following account of the sad occurrence carefully and
dispassionately before they render that judgment.</p>
<p>The Senate was already in session, and Caesar was coming down the
street toward the capitol, conversing with some personal friends, and
followed, as usual, by a large number of citizens. Just as he was
passing in front of Demosthenes and Thucydides’ drug store, he was
observing casually to a gentleman, who, our informant thinks, is a
fortune-teller, that the Ides of March were come. The reply was, “Yes,
they are come, but not gone yet.“ At this moment Artemidorus stepped up
and passed the time of day, and asked Caesar to read a schedule or a
tract or something of the kind, which he had brought for his perusal.
Mr. Decius Brutus also said something about an “humble suit“ which he
wanted read. Artexnidorus begged that attention might be paid to his
first, because it was of personal consequence to Caesar. The latter
replied that what concerned himself should be read last, or words to
that effect. Artemidorus begged and beseeched him to read the paper
instantly!–[Mark that: It is hinted by William Shakespeare, who saw the
beginning and the end of the unfortunate affray, that this “schedule“
was simply a note discovering to Caesar that a plot was brewing to take
his life.]–However, Caesar shook him off, and refused to read any
petition in the street. He then entered the capitol, and the crowd
followed him.</p>
<p>About this time the following conversation was overheard, and we
consider that, taken in connection with the events which succeeded it,
it bears an appalling significance: Mr. Papilius Lena remarked to George
W. Cassias (commonly known as the “Nobby Boy of the Third Ward“), a
bruiser in the pay of the Opposition, that he hoped his enterprise
to-day might thrive; and when Cassias asked “What enterprise?“ he only
closed his left eye temporarily and said with simulated indifference,
“Fare you well,“ and sauntered toward Caesar. Marcus Brutus, who is
suspected of being the ringleader of the band that killed Caesar, asked
what it was that Lena had said. Cassias told him, and added in a low
tone, “I fear our purpose is discovered.“</p>
<p>Brutus told his wretched accomplice to keep an eye on Lena, and a
moment after Cassias urged that lean and hungry vagrant, Casca, whose
reputation here is none of the best, to be sudden, for he feared
prevention. He then turned to Brutus, apparently much excited, and asked
what should be done, and swore that either he or Caesar would never turn
back–he would kill himself first. At this time Caesar was talking to
some of the back-country members about the approaching fall elections,
and paying little attention to what was going on around him. Billy
Trebonius got into conversation with the people’s friend and
Caesar’s–Mark Antony–and under some pretense or other got him away, and
Brutus, Decius, Casca, Cinna, Metellus Cimber, and others of the gang of
infamous desperadoes that infest Rome at present, closed around the
doomed Caesar. Then Metellus Cimber knelt down and begged that his
brother might be recalled from banishment, but Caesar rebuked him for
his fawning conduct, and refused to grant his petition. Immediately, at
Cimber’s request, first Brutus and then Cassias begged for the return of
the banished Publius; but Caesar still refused. He said he could not be
moved; that he was as fixed as the North Star, and proceeded to speak in
the most complimentary terms of the firmness of that star and its steady
character. Then he said he was like it, and he believed he was the only
man in the country that was; therefore, since he was “constant“ that
Cimber should be banished, he was also “constant“ that he should stay
banished, and he’d be hanged if he didn’t keep him so!</p>
<p>Instantly seizing upon this shallow pretext for a fight, Casca sprang
at Caesar and struck him with a dirk, Caesar grabbing him by the arm
with his right hand, and launching a blow straight from the shoulder
with his left, that sent the reptile bleeding to the earth. He then
backed up against Pompey’s statue, and squared himself to receive his
assailants. Cassias and Cimber and Cinna rushed, upon him with their
daggers drawn, and the former succeeded in inflicting a wound upon his
body; but before he could strike again, and before either of the others
could strike at all, Caesar stretched the three miscreants at his feet
with as many blows of his powerful fist. By this time the Senate was in
an indescribable uproar; the throng of citizens is the lobbies had
blockaded the doors in their frantic efforts to escape from the
building, the sergeant-at-arms and his assistants were struggling with
the assassins, venerable senators had cast aside their encumbering
robes, and were leaping over benches and flying down the aisles in wild
confusion toward the shelter of the committee-rooms, and a thousand
voices were shouting “Po-lice! Po-lice!“ in discordant tones that rose
above the frightful din like shrieking winds above the roaring of a
tempest. And amid it all great Caesar stood with his back against the
statue, like a lion at bay, and fought his assailants weaponless and
hand to hand, with the defiant bearing and the unwavering courage which
he had shown before on many a bloody field. Billy Trebonius and Caius
Legarius struck him with their daggers and fell, as their
brother-conspirators before them had fallen. But at last, when Caesar
saw his old friend Brutus step forward armed with a murderous knife, it
is said he seemed utterly overpowered with grief and amazement, and,
dropping his invincible left arm by his side, he hid his face in the
folds of his mantle and received the treacherous blow without an effort
to stay the hand that gave it. He only said, “Et tu, Brute?“ and fell
lifeless on the marble pavement.</p>
<p>We learn that the coat deceased had on when he was killed was the
same one he wore in his tent on the afternoon of the day he overcame the
Nervii, and that when it was removed from the corpse it was found to be
cut and gashed in no less than seven different places. There was nothing
in the pockets. It will be exhibited at the coroner’s inquest, and will
be damning proof of the fact of the killing. These latter facts may be
relied on, as we get them from Mark Antony, whose position enables him
to learn every item of news connected with the one subject of absorbing
interest of-to-day.</p>
<p>LATER: While the coroner was summoning a jury, Mark Antony and other
friends of the late Caesar got hold of the body, and lugged it off to
the Forum, and at last accounts Antony and Brutus were making speeches
over it and raising such a row among the people that, as we go to press,
the chief of police is satisfied there is going to be a riot, and is
taking measures accordingly.</p>
