<h4 id="chapter-48-sugar-and-postage">Chapter 48 Sugar and Postage</h4>
<p>ONE day, on the street, I encountered the man whom, of all men, I
most wished to see–Horace Bixby; formerly pilot under me–or rather, over
me–now captain of the great steamer ‘City of Baton Rouge,’ the latest
and swiftest addition to the Anchor Line. The same slender figure, the
same tight curls, the same springy step, the same alertness, the same
decision of eye and answering decision of hand, the same erect military
bearing; not an inch gained or lost in girth, not an ounce gained or
lost in weight, not a hair turned. It is a curious thing, to leave a man
thirty-five years old, and come back at the end of twenty-one years and
find him still only thirty-five. I have not had an experience of this
kind before, I believe. There were some crow’s-feet, but they counted
for next to nothing, since they were inconspicuous.</p>
<p>His boat was just in. I had been waiting several days for her,
purposing to return to St. Louis in her. The captain and I joined a
party of ladies and gentlemen, guests of Major Wood, and went down the
river fifty-four miles, in a swift tug, to ex-Governor Warmouth’s sugar
plantation. Strung along below the city, were a number of decayed, ram-
shackly, superannuated old steamboats, not one of which had I ever seen
before. They had all been built, and worn out, and thrown aside, since I
was here last. This gives one a realizing sense of the frailness of a
Mississippi boat and the briefness of its life.</p>
<p>Six miles below town a fat and battered brick chimney, sticking above
the magnolias and live-oaks, was pointed out as the monument erected by
an appreciative nation to celebrate the battle of New Orleans–Jackson’s
victory over the British, January 8, 1815. The war had ended, the two
nations were at peace, but the news had not yet reached New Orleans. If
we had had the cable telegraph in those days, this blood would not have
been spilt, those lives would not have been wasted; and better still,
Jackson would probably never have been president. We have gotten over
the harms done us by the war of 1812, but not over some of those done us
by Jackson’s presidency.</p>
<p>The Warmouth plantation covers a vast deal of ground, and the
hospitality of the Warmouth mansion is graduated to the same large
scale. We saw steam-plows at work, here, for the first time. The
traction engine travels about on its own wheels, till it reaches the
required spot; then it stands still and by means of a wire rope pulls
the huge plow toward itself two or three hundred yards across the field,
between the rows of cane. The thing cuts down into the black mold a foot
and a half deep. The plow looks like a fore-and-aft brace of a Hudson
river steamer, inverted. When the negro steersman sits on one end of it,
that end tilts down near the ground, while the other sticks up high in
air. This great see-saw goes rolling and pitching like a ship at sea,
and it is not every circus rider that could stay on it.</p>
<p>The plantation contains two thousand six hundred acres; six hundred
and fifty are in cane; and there is a fruitful orange grove of five
thousand trees. The cane is cultivated after a modern and intricate
scientific fashion, too elaborate and complex for me to attempt to
describe; but it lost 0,000 last year. I forget the other details.
However, this year’s crop will reach ten or twelve hundred tons of
sugar, consequently last year’s loss will not matter. These troublesome
and expensive scientific methods achieve a yield of a ton and a half and
from that to two tons, to the acre; which is three or four times what
the yield of an acre was in my time.</p>
<p>The drainage-ditches were everywhere alive with little crabs–
‘fiddlers.’ One saw them scampering sidewise in every direction whenever
they heard a disturbing noise. Expensive pests, these crabs; for they
bore into the levees, and ruin them.</p>
<p>The great sugar-house was a wilderness of tubs and tanks and vats and
filters, pumps, pipes, and machinery. The process of making sugar is
exceedingly interesting. First, you heave your cane into the
centrifugals and grind out the juice; then run it through the
evaporating pan to extract the fiber; then through the bone-filter to
remove the alcohol; then through the clarifying tanks to discharge the
molasses; then through the granulating pipe to condense it; then through
the vacuum pan to extract the vacuum. It is now ready for market. I have
jotted these particulars down from memory. The thing looks simple and
easy. Do not deceive yourself. To make sugar is really one of the most
difficult things in the world. And to make it right, is next to
impossible. If you will examine your own supply every now and then for a
term of years, and tabulate the result, you will find that not two men
in twenty can make sugar without getting sand into it.</p>
<p>We could have gone down to the mouth of the river and visited Captain
Eads’ great work, the ‘jetties,’ where the river has been compressed
between walls, and thus deepened to twenty-six feet; but it was voted
useless to go, since at this stage of the water everything would be
covered up and invisible.</p>
<p>We could have visited that ancient and singular burg, ‘Pilot-town,’
which stands on stilts in the water–so they say; where nearly all
communication is by skiff and canoe, even to the attending of weddings
and funerals; and where the littlest boys and girls are as handy with
the oar as unamphibious children are with the velocipede.</p>
<p>We could have done a number of other things; but on account of
limited time, we went back home. The sail up the breezy and sparkling
river was a charming experience, and would have been satisfyingly
sentimental and romantic but for the interruptions of the tug’s pet
parrot, whose tireless comments upon the scenery and the guests were
always this- worldly, and often profane. He had also a superabundance of
the discordant, ear-splitting, metallic laugh common to his breed–a
machine-made laugh, a Frankenstein laugh, with the soul left out of it.
He applied it to every sentimental remark, and to every pathetic song.
He cackled it out with hideous energy after ‘Home again, home again from
a foreign shore,’ and said he ‘wouldn’t give a damn for a tug-load of
such rot.’ Romance and sentiment cannot long survive this sort of
discouragement; so the singing and talking presently ceased; which so
delighted the parrot that he cursed himself hoarse for joy.</p>
<p>Then the male members of the party moved to the forecastle, to smoke
and gossip. There were several old steamboatmen along, and I learned
from them a great deal of what had been happening to my former river
friends during my long absence. I learned that a pilot whom I used to
steer for is become a spiritualist, and for more than fifteen years has
been receiving a letter every week from a deceased relative, through a
New York spiritualist medium named Manchester–postage graduated by
distance: from the local post-office in Paradise to New York, five
dollars; from New York to St. Louis, three cents. I remember
Mr. Manchester very well. I called on him once, ten years ago, with a
couple of friends, one of whom wished to inquire after a deceased uncle.
This uncle had lost his life in a peculiarly violent and unusual way,
half a dozen years before: a cyclone blew him some three miles and
knocked a tree down with him which was four feet through at the butt and
sixty- five feet high. He did not survive this triumph. At the seance
just referred to, my friend questioned his late uncle, through
Mr. Manchester, and the late uncle wrote down his replies, using
Mr. Manchester’s hand and pencil for that purpose. The following is a
fair example of the questions asked, and also of the sloppy twaddle in
the way of answers, furnished by Manchester under the pretense that it
came from the specter. If this man is not the paltriest fraud that
lives, I owe him an apology–</p>
<p>QUESTION. Where are you?</p>
<p>ANSWER. In the spirit world.</p>
<p>Q. Are you happy?</p>
<p>A. Very happy. Perfectly happy.</p>
<p>Q. How do you amuse yourself?</p>
<p>A. Conversation with friends, and other spirits.</p>
<p>Q. What else?</p>
<p>A. Nothing else. Nothing else is necessary.</p>
<p>Q. What do you talk about?</p>
<p>A. About how happy we are; and about friends left behind in the
earth, and how to influence them for their good.</p>
<p>Q. When your friends in the earth all get to the spirit land, what
shall you have to talk about then?–nothing but about how happy you all
are?</p>
<p>No reply. It is explained that spirits will not answer frivolous
questions.</p>
<p>Q. How is it that spirits that are content to spend an eternity in
frivolous employments, and accept it as happiness, are so fastidious
about frivolous questions upon the subject?</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>Q. Would you like to come back?</p>
<p>A. No.</p>
<p>Q. Would you say that under oath?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. What do you eat there?</p>
<p>A. We do not eat.</p>
<p>Q. What do you drink?</p>
<p>A. We do not drink.</p>
<p>Q. What do you smoke?</p>
<p>A. We do not smoke.</p>
<p>Q. What do you read?</p>
<p>A. We do not read.</p>
<p>Q. Do all the good people go to your place?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. You know my present way of life. Can you suggest any additions to
it, in the way of crime, that will reasonably insure my going to some
other place.</p>
<p>A. No reply.</p>
<p>Q. When did you die?</p>
<p>A. I did not die, I passed away.</p>
<p>Q. Very well, then, when did you pass away? How long have you been in
the spirit land?</p>
<p>A. We have no measurements of time here.</p>
<p>Q. Though you may be indifferent and uncertain as to dates and times
in your present condition and environment, this has nothing to do with
your former condition. You had dates then. One of these is what I ask
for. You departed on a certain day in a certain year. Is not this
true?</p>
<p>A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. Then name the day of the month.</p>
<p>(Much fumbling with pencil, on the part of the medium, accompanied by
violent spasmodic jerkings of his head and body, for some little time.
Finally, explanation to the effect that spirits often forget dates, such
things being without importance to them.)</p>
<p>Q. Then this one has actually forgotten the date of its translation
to the spirit land?</p>
<p>This was granted to be the case.</p>
<p>Q. This is very curious. Well, then, what year was it?</p>
<p>(More fumbling, jerking, idiotic spasms, on the part of the medium.
Finally, explanation to the effect that the spirit has forgotten the
year.)</p>
<p>Q. This is indeed stupendous. Let me put one more question, one last
question, to you, before we part to meet no more;–for even if I fail to
avoid your asylum, a meeting there will go for nothing as a meeting,
since by that time you will easily have forgotten me and my name: did
you die a natural death, or were you cut off by a catastrophe?</p>
<p>A. (After long hesitation and many throes and spasms.) NATURAL
DEATH.</p>
<p>This ended the interview. My friend told the medium that when his
relative was in this poor world, he was endowed with an extraordinary
intellect and an absolutely defectless memory, and it seemed a great
pity that he had not been allowed to keep some shred of these for his
amusement in the realms of everlasting contentment, and for the
amazement and admiration of the rest of the population there.</p>
<p>This man had plenty of clients–has plenty yet. He receives letters
from spirits located in every part of the spirit world, and delivers
them all over this country through the United States mail. These letters
are filled with advice–advice from ‘spirits’ who don’t know as much as a
tadpole–and this advice is religiously followed by the receivers. One of
these clients was a man whom the spirits (if one may thus plurally
describe the ingenious Manchester) were teaching how to contrive an
improved railway car-wheel. It is coarse employment for a spirit, but it
is higher and wholesomer activity than talking for ever about ‘how happy
we are.’</p>
