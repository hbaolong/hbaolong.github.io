<h4 id="chapter-vi.">CHAPTER VI.</h4>
<p>In the course of time the twins arrived and were delivered to their
great kinsman. To try to describe the rage of that old man would profit
nothing, the attempt would fall so far short of the purpose. However
when he had worn himself out and got quiet again, he looked the matter
over and decided that the twins had some moral rights, although they had
no legal ones; they were of his blood, and it could not be decorous to
treat them as common clay. So he laid them with their majestic kin in
the Cholmondeley church, with imposing state and ceremony, and added the
supreme touch by officiating as chief mourner himself. But he drew the
line at hatchments.</p>
<p>Our friends in Washington watched the weary days go by, while they
waited for Pete and covered his name with reproaches because of his
calamitous procrastinations. Meantime, Sally Sellers, who was as
practical and democratic as the Lady Gwendolen Sellers was romantic and
aristocratic, was leading a life of intense interest and activity and
getting the most she could out of her double personality. All day long
in the privacy of her work-room, Sally Sellers earned bread for the
Sellers family; and all the evening Lady Gwendolen Sellers supported the
Rossmore dignity. All day she was American, practically, and proud of
the work of her head and hands and its commercial result; all the
evening she took holiday and dwelt in a rich shadow-land peopled with
titled and coroneted fictions. By day, to her, the place was a plain,
unaffected, ramshackle old trap just that, and nothing more; by night it
was Rossmore Towers. At college she had learned a trade without knowing
it. The girls had found out that she was the designer of her own gowns.
She had no idle moments after that, and wanted none; for the exercise of
an extraordinary gift is the supremest pleasure in life, and it was
manifest that Sally Sellers possessed a gift of that sort in the matter
of costume-designing. Within three days after reaching home she had
hunted up some work; before Pete was yet due in Washington, and before
the twins were fairly asleep in English soil, she was already nearly
swamped with work, and the sacrificing of the family chromos for debt
had got an effective check.</p>
<p>“She’s a brick,“ said Rossmore to the Major; “just her father all
over: prompt to labor with head or hands, and not ashamed of it;
capable, always capable, let the enterprise be what it may; successful
by nature– don’t know what defeat is; thus, intensely and practically
American by inhaled nationalism, and at the same time intensely and
aristocratically European by inherited nobility of blood. Just me,
exactly: Mulberry Sellers in matter of finance and invention; after
office hours, what do you find? The same clothes, yes, but what’s in
them? Rossmore of the peerage.“</p>
<p>The two friends had haunted the general post-office daily. At last
they had their reward. Toward evening the 20th of May, they got a letter
for XYZ. It bore the Washington postmark; the note itself was not dated.
It said:</p>
<p>“Ash barrel back of lamp post Black horse Alley. If you are playing
square go and set on it to-morrow morning 21st 10.22 not sooner not
later wait till I come.“</p>
<p>The friends cogitated over the note profoundly. Presently the earl
said:</p>
<p>“Don’t you reckon he’s afraid we are a sheriff with a
requisition?“</p>
<p>“Why, m’lord?“</p>
<p>“Because that’s no place for a seance. Nothing friendly, nothing
sociable about it. And at the same time, a body that wanted to know who
was roosting on that ash-barrel without exposing himself by going near
it, or seeming to be interested in it, could just stand on the street
corner and take a glance down the alley and satisfy himself, don’t you
see?“</p>
<p>“Yes, his idea is plain, now. He seems to be a man that can’t be
candid and straightforward. He acts as if he thought we–shucks, I wish
he had come out like a man and told us what hotel he–“</p>
<p>“Now you’ve struck it! you’ve struck it sure, Washington; he has told
us.“</p>
<p>“Has he?“</p>
<p>“Yes, he has; but he didn’t mean to. That alley is a lonesome little
pocket that runs along one side of the New Gadsby. That’s his
hotel.“</p>
<p>“What makes’ you think that?“</p>
<p>“Why, I just know it. He’s got a room that’s just across from that
lamp post. He’s going to sit there perfectly comfortable behind his
shutters at 10.22 to-morrow, and when he sees us sitting on the
ash-barrel, he’ll say to himself, ‘I saw one of those fellows on the
train’–and then he’ll pack his satchel in half a minute and ship for the
ends of the earth.“</p>
<p>Hawkins turned sick with disappointment:</p>
<p>“Oh, dear, it’s all up, Colonel–it’s exactly what he’ll do.“</p>
<p>“Indeed he won’t!“</p>
<p>“Won’t he? Why?“</p>
<p>“Because you won’t be holding the ash barrel down, it’ll be me.
You’ll be coming in with an officer and a requisition in plain
clothes–the officer, I mean–the minute you see him arrive and open up a
talk with me.“</p>
<p>“Well, what a head you have got, Colonel Sellers! I never should have
thought of that in the world.“</p>
<p>“Neither would any earl of Rossmore, betwixt William’s contribution
and Mulberry–as earl; but it’s office hours, now, you see, and the earl
in me sleeps. Come–I’ll show you his very room.“</p>
<p>They reached the neighborhood of the New Gadsby about nine in the
evening, and passed down the alley to the lamp post.</p>
<p>“There you are,“ said the colonel, triumphantly, with a wave of his
hand which took in the whole side of the hotel. “There it is–what did I
tell you?“</p>
<p>“Well, but–why, Colonel, it’s six stories high. I don’t quite make
out which window you–“</p>
<p>“All the windows, all of them. Let him have his choice–I’m
indifferent, now that I have located him. You go and stand on the corner
and wait; I’ll prospect the hotel.“</p>
<p>The earl drifted here and there through the swarming lobby, and
finally took a waiting position in the neighborhood of the elevator.
During an hour crowds went up and crowds came down; and all complete as
to limbs; but at last the watcher got a glimpse of a figure that was
satisfactory– got a glimpse of the back of it, though he had missed his
chance at the face through waning alertness. The glimpse revealed a
cowboy hat, and below it a plaided sack of rather loud pattern, and an
empty sleeve pinned up to the shoulder. Then the elevator snatched the
vision aloft and the watcher fled away in joyful excitement, and
rejoined the fellow-conspirator.</p>
<p>“We’ve got him, Major–got him sure! I’ve seen him–seen him good; and
I don’t care where or when that man approaches me backwards, I’ll
recognize him every time. We’re all right. Now for the requisition.“</p>
<p>They got it, after the delays usual in such cases. By half past
eleven they were at home and happy, and went to bed full of dreams of
the morrow’s great promise.</p>
<p>Among the elevator load which had the suspect for fellow-passenger
was a young kinsman of Mulberry Sellers, but Mulberry was not aware of
it and didn’t see him. It was Viscount Berkeley.</p>
