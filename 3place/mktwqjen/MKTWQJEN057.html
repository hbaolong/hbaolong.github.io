<h4 id="chapter-lvi.">CHAPTER LVI.</h4>
<p>We visited all the holy places about Jerusalem which we had left
unvisited when we journeyed to the Jordan and then, about three o’clock
one afternoon, we fell into procession and marched out at the stately
Damascus gate, and the walls of Jerusalem shut us out forever. We paused
on the summit of a distant hill and took a final look and made a final
farewell to the venerable city which had been such a good home to
us.</p>
<p>For about four hours we traveled down hill constantly. We followed a
narrow bridle-path which traversed the beds of the mountain gorges, and
when we could we got out of the way of the long trains of laden camels
and asses, and when we could not we suffered the misery of being mashed
up against perpendicular walls of rock and having our legs bruised by
the passing freight. Jack was caught two or three times, and Dan and
Moult as often. One horse had a heavy fall on the slippery rocks, and
the others had narrow escapes. However, this was as good a road as we
had found in Palestine, and possibly even the best, and so there was not
much grumbling.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the glens, we came upon luxuriant orchards of figs,
apricots, pomegranates, and such things, but oftener the scenery was
rugged, mountainous, verdureless and forbidding. Here and there, towers
were perched high up on acclivities which seemed almost inaccessible.
This fashion is as old as Palestine itself and was adopted in ancient
times for security against enemies.</p>
<p>We crossed the brook which furnished David the stone that killed
Goliah, and no doubt we looked upon the very ground whereon that noted
battle was fought. We passed by a picturesque old gothic ruin whose
stone pavements had rung to the armed heels of many a valorous Crusader,
and we rode through a piece of country which we were told once knew
Samson as a citizen.</p>
<p>We staid all night with the good monks at the convent of Ramleh, and
in the morning got up and galloped the horses a good part of the
distance from there to Jaffa, or Joppa, for the plain was as level as a
floor and free from stones, and besides this was our last march in Holy
Land. These two or three hours finished, we and the tired horses could
have rest and sleep as long as we wanted it. This was the plain of which
Joshua spoke when he said, “Sun, stand thou still on Gibeon, and thou
moon in the valley of Ajalon.“ As we drew near to Jaffa, the boys
spurred up the horses and indulged in the excitement of an actual race
–an experience we had hardly had since we raced on donkeys in the Azores
islands.</p>
<p>We came finally to the noble grove of orange-trees in which the
Oriental city of Jaffa lies buried; we passed through the walls, and
rode again down narrow streets and among swarms of animated rags, and
saw other sights and had other experiences we had long been familiar
with. We dismounted, for the last time, and out in the offing, riding at
anchor, we saw the ship! I put an exclamation point there because we
felt one when we saw the vessel. The long pilgrimage was ended, and
somehow we seemed to feel glad of it.</p>
<p>[For description of Jaffa, see Universal Gazetteer.] Simon the Tanner
formerly lived here. We went to his house. All the pilgrims visit Simon
the Tanner’s house. Peter saw the vision of the beasts let down in a
sheet when he lay upon the roof of Simon the Tanner’s house. It was from
Jaffa that Jonah sailed when he was told to go and prophesy against
Nineveh, and no doubt it was not far from the town that the whale threw
him up when he discovered that he had no ticket. Jonah was disobedient,
and of a fault-finding, complaining disposition, and deserves to be
lightly spoken of, almost. The timbers used in the construction of
Solomon’s Temple were floated to Jaffa in rafts, and the narrow opening
in the reef through which they passed to the shore is not an inch wider
or a shade less dangerous to navigate than it was then. Such is the
sleepy nature of the population Palestine’s only good seaport has now
and always had. Jaffa has a history and a stirring one. It will not be
discovered any where in this book. If the reader will call at the
circulating library and mention my name, he will be furnished with books
which will afford him the fullest information concerning Jaffa.</p>
<p>So ends the pilgrimage. We ought to be glad that we did not make it
for the purpose of feasting our eyes upon fascinating aspects of nature,
for we should have been disappointed–at least at this season of the
year. A writer in “Life in the Holy Land“ observes:</p>
<p>“Monotonous and uninviting as much of the Holy Land will appear to
persons accustomed to the almost constant verdure of flowers, ample
streams and varied surface of our own country, we must remember that its
aspect to the Israelites after the weary march of forty years through
the desert must have been very different.“</p>
<p>Which all of us will freely grant. But it truly is “monotonous and
uninviting,“ and there is no sufficient reason for describing it as
being otherwise.</p>
<p>Of all the lands there are for dismal scenery, I think Palestine must
be the prince. The hills are barren, they are dull of color, they are
unpicturesque in shape. The valleys are unsightly deserts fringed with a
feeble vegetation that has an expression about it of being sorrowful and
despondent. The Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee sleep in the midst of a
vast stretch of hill and plain wherein the eye rests upon no pleasant
tint, no striking object, no soft picture dreaming in a purple haze or
mottled with the shadows of the clouds. Every outline is harsh, every
feature is distinct, there is no perspective–distance works no
enchantment here. It is a hopeless, dreary, heart-broken land.</p>
<p>Small shreds and patches of it must be very beautiful in the full
flush of spring, however, and all the more beautiful by contrast with
the far-reaching desolation that surrounds them on every side. I would
like much to see the fringes of the Jordan in spring-time, and Shechem,
Esdraelon, Ajalon and the borders of Galilee–but even then these spots
would seem mere toy gardens set at wide intervals in the waste of a
limitless desolation.</p>
<p>Palestine sits in sackcloth and ashes. Over it broods the spell of a
curse that has withered its fields and fettered its energies. Where
Sodom and Gomorrah reared their domes and towers, that solemn sea now
floods the plain, in whose bitter waters no living thing exists–over
whose waveless surface the blistering air hangs motionless and dead
–about whose borders nothing grows but weeds, and scattering tufts of
cane, and that treacherous fruit that promises refreshment to parching
lips, but turns to ashes at the touch. Nazareth is forlorn; about that
ford of Jordan where the hosts of Israel entered the Promised Land with
songs of rejoicing, one finds only a squalid camp of fantastic Bedouins
of the desert; Jericho the accursed, lies a moldering ruin, to-day, even
as Joshua’s miracle left it more than three thousand years ago;
Bethlehem and Bethany, in their poverty and their humiliation, have
nothing about them now to remind one that they once knew the high honor
of the Saviour’s presence; the hallowed spot where the shepherds watched
their flocks by night, and where the angels sang Peace on earth, good
will to men, is untenanted by any living creature, and unblessed by any
feature that is pleasant to the eye. Renowned Jerusalem itself, the
stateliest name in history, has lost all its ancient grandeur, and is
become a pauper village; the riches of Solomon are no longer there to
compel the admiration of visiting Oriental queens; the wonderful temple
which was the pride and the glory of Israel, is gone, and the Ottoman
crescent is lifted above the spot where, on that most memorable day in
the annals of the world, they reared the Holy Cross. The noted Sea of
Galilee, where Roman fleets once rode at anchor and the disciples of the
Saviour sailed in their ships, was long ago deserted by the devotees of
war and commerce, and its borders are a silent wilderness; Capernaum is
a shapeless ruin; Magdala is the home of beggared Arabs; Bethsaida and
Chorazin have vanished from the earth, and the “desert places“ round
about them where thousands of men once listened to the Saviour’s voice
and ate the miraculous bread, sleep in the hush of a solitude that is
inhabited only by birds of prey and skulking foxes.</p>
<p>Palestine is desolate and unlovely. And why should it be otherwise?
Can the curse of the Deity beautify a land?</p>
<p>Palestine is no more of this work-day world. It is sacred to poetry
and tradition–it is dream-land.</p>
