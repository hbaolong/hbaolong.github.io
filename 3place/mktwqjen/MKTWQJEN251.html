<h4 id="the-tone-imparting-committee">THE TONE-IMPARTING COMMITTEE</h4>
<p>I get old and ponderously respectable, only one thing will be able to
make me truly happy, and that will be to be put on the Venerable
Tone-Imparting committee of the city of New York, and have nothing to do
but sit on the platform, solemn and imposing, along with Peter Cooper,
Horace Greeley, etc., etc., and shed momentary fame at second hand on
obscure lecturers, draw public attention to lectures which would
otherwise clack eloquently to sounding emptiness, and subdue audiences
into respectful hearing of all sorts of unpopular and outlandish dogmas
and isms. That is what I desire for the cheer and gratification of my
gray hairs. Let me but sit up there with those fine relics of the Old
Red Sandstone Period and give Tone to an intellectual entertainment
twice a week, and be so reported, and my happiness will be complete.
Those men have been my envy for long, long time. And no memories of my
life are so pleasant as my reminiscence of their long and honorable
career in the Tone-imparting service. I can recollect that first time I
ever saw them on the platforms just as well as I can remember the events
of yesterday. Horace Greeley sat on the right, Peter Cooper on the left,
and Thomas Jefferson, Red Jacket, Benjamin Franklin, and John Hancock
sat between them. This was on the 22d of December, 1799, on the occasion
of the state’ funeral of George Washington in New York. It was a great
day, that–a great day, and a very, very sad one. I remember that
Broadway was one mass of black crape from Castle Garden nearly up to
where the City Hall now stands. The next time I saw these gentlemen
officiate was at a ball given for the purpose of procuring money and
medicines for the sick and wounded soldiers and sailors. Horace Greeley
occupied one side of the platform on which the musicians were exalted,
and Peter Cooper the other. There were other Tone-imparters attendant
upon the two chiefs, but I have forgotten their names now. Horace
Greeley, gray-haired and beaming, was in sailor costume–white duck
pants, blue shirt, open at the breast, large neckerchief, loose as an
ox-bow, and tied with a jaunty sailor knot, broad turnover collar with
star in the corner, shiny black little tarpaulin hat roosting daintily
far back on head, and flying two gallant long ribbons. Slippers on ample
feet, round spectacles on benignant nose, and pitchfork in hand,
completed Mr. Greeley, and made him, in my boyish admiration, every inch
a sailor, and worthy to be the honored great-grandfather of the Neptune
he was so ingeniously representing. I shall never forget him. Mr. Cooper
was dressed as a general of militia, and was dismally and oppressively
warlike. I neglected to remark, in the proper place, that the soldiers
and sailors in whose aid the ball was given had just been sent in from
Boston–this was during the war of 1812. At the grand national reception
of Lafayette, in 1824, Horace Greeley sat on the right and Peter Cooper
to the left. The other Tone-imparters of the day are sleeping the sleep
of the just now. I was in the audience when Horace Greeley Peter Cooper,
and other chief citizens imparted tone to the great meetings in favor of
French liberty, in 1848. Then I never saw them any more until here
lately; but now that I am living tolerably near the city, I run down
every time I see it announced that “Horace Greeley, Peter Cooper, and
several other distinguished citizens will occupy seats on the platform;“
and next morning, when I read in the first paragraph of the phonographic
report that “Horace Greeley, Peter Cooper, and several other
distinguished citizens occupied seats on the platform,“ I say to myself,
“Thank God, I was present.“ Thus I have been enabled to see these
substantial old friends of mine sit on the platform and give tone to
lectures on anatomy, and lectures on agriculture, and lectures on
stirpiculture, and lectures on astronomy, on chemistry, on
miscegenation, on “Is Man Descended from the Kangaroo?“ on veterinary
matters, on all kinds of religion, and several kinds of politics; and
have seen them give tone and grandeur to the Four-legged Girl, the
Siamese Twins, the Great Egyptian Sword Swallower, and the Old Original
Jacobs. Whenever somebody is to lecture on a subject not of general
interest, I know that my venerated Remains of the Old Red Sandstone
Period will be on the platform; whenever a lecturer is to appear whom
nobody has heard of before, nor will be likely to seek to see, I know
that the real benevolence of my old friends will be taken advantage of,
and that they will be on the platform (and in the bills) as an
advertisement; and whenever any new and obnoxious deviltry in
philosophy, morals, or politics is to be sprung upon the people, I know
perfectly well that these intrepid old heroes will be on the platform
too, in the interest of full and free discussion, and to crush down all
narrower and less generous souls with the solid dead weight of their
awful respectability. And let us all remember that while these
inveterate and imperishable presiders (if you please) appear on the
platform every night in the year as regularly as the volunteered piano
from Steinway’s or Chickering’s, and have bolstered up and given tone to
a deal of questionable merit and obscure emptiness in their time, they
have also diversified this inconsequential service by occasional
powerful uplifting and upholding of great progressive ideas which
smaller men feared to meddle with or countenance.</p>
