<h4 id="chapter-lvii.">CHAPTER LVII.</h4>
<p>She was not quite what you would call refined. She was not quite what
you would call unrefined. She was the kind of person that keeps a
parrot. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>So far as I am able to judge, nothing has been left undone, either by
man or Nature, to make India the most extraordinary country that the sun
visits on his round. Nothing seems to have been forgotten, nothing over
looked. Always, when you think you have come to the end of her
tremendous specialties and have finished banging tags upon her as the
Land of the Thug, the Land of the Plague, the Land of Famine, the Land
of Giant Illusions, the Land of Stupendous Mountains, and so forth,
another specialty crops up and another tag is required. I have been
overlooking the fact that India is by an unapproachable supremacy–the
Land of Murderous Wild Creatures. Perhaps it will be simplest to throw
away the tags and generalize her with one all-comprehensive name, as the
Land of Wonders.</p>
<p>For many years the British Indian Government has been trying to
destroy the murderous wild creatures, and has spent a great deal of
money in the effort. The annual official returns show that the
undertaking is a difficult one.</p>
<p>These returns exhibit a curious annual uniformity in results; the
sort of uniformity which you find in the annual output of suicides in
the world’s capitals, and the proportions of deaths by this, that, and
the other disease. You can always come close to foretelling how many
suicides will occur in Paris, London, and New York, next year, and also
how many deaths will result from cancer, consumption, dog-bite, falling
out of the window, getting run over by cabs, etc., if you know the
statistics of those matters for the present year. In the same way, with
one year’s Indian statistics before you, you can guess closely at how
many people were killed in that Empire by tigers during the previous
year, and the year before that, and the year before that, and at how
many were killed in each of those years by bears, how many by wolves,
and how many by snakes; and you can also guess closely at how many
people are going to be killed each year for the coming five years by
each of those agencies. You can also guess closely at how many of each
agency the government is going to kill each year for the next five
years.</p>
<p>I have before me statistics covering a period of six consecutive
years. By these, I know that in India the tiger kills something over 800
persons every year, and that the government responds by killing about
double as many tigers every year. In four of the six years referred to,
the tiger got 800 odd; in one of the remaining two years he got only
700, but in the other remaining year he made his average good by scoring
917. He is always sure of his average. Anyone who bets that the tiger
will kill 2,400 people in India in any three consecutive years has
invested his money in a certainty; anyone who bets that he will kill
2,600 in any three consecutive years, is absolutely sure to lose.</p>
<p>As strikingly uniform as are the statistics of suicide, they are not
any more so than are those of the tiger’s annual output of slaughtered
human beings in India. The government’s work is quite uniform, too; it
about doubles the tiger’s average. In six years the tiger killed 5,000
persons, minus 50; in the same six years 10,000 tigers were killed,
minus 400.</p>
<p>The wolf kills nearly as many people as the tiger–700 a year to the
tiger’s 800 odd–but while he is doing it, more than 5,000 of his tribe
fall.</p>
<p>The leopard kills an average of 230 people per year, but loses 3,300
of his own mess while he is doing it.</p>
<p>The bear kills 100 people per year at a cost of 1,250 of his own
tribe.</p>
<p>The tiger, as the figures show, makes a very handsome fight against
man. But it is nothing to the elephant’s fight. The king of beasts, the
lord of the jungle, loses four of his mess per year, but he kills
forty–five persons to make up for it.</p>
<p>But when it comes to killing cattle, the lord of the jungle is not
interested. He kills but 100 in six years–horses of hunters, no doubt
–but in the same six the tiger kills more than 84,000, the leopard
100,000, the bear 4,000, the wolf 70,000, the hyena more than 13,000,
other wild beasts 27,000, and the snakes 19,000, a grand total of more
than 300,000; an average of 50,000 head per year.</p>
<p>In response, the government kills, in the six years, a total of
3,201,232 wild beasts and snakes. Ten for one.</p>
<p>It will be perceived that the snakes are not much interested in
cattle; they kill only 3,000 odd per year. The snakes are much more
interested in man. India swarms with deadly snakes. At the head of the
list is the cobra, the deadliest known to the world, a snake whose bite
kills where the rattlesnake’s bite merely entertains.</p>
<p>In India, the annual man-killings by snakes are as uniform, as
regular, and as forecastable as are the tiger-average and the
suicide-average. Anyone who bets that in India, in any three consecutive
years the snakes will kill 49,500 persons, will win his bet; and anyone
who bets that in India in any three consecutive years, the snakes will
kill 53,500 persons, will lose his bet. In India the snakes kill 17,000
people a year; they hardly ever fall short of it; they as seldom exceed
it. An insurance actuary could take the Indian census tables and the
government’s snake tables and tell you within sixpence how much it would
be worth to insure a man against death by snake-bite there. If I had a
dollar for every person killed per year in India, I would rather have it
than any other property, as it is the only property in the world not
subject to shrinkage.</p>
<p>I should like to have a royalty on the government-end of the snake
business, too, and am in London now trying to get it; but when I get it
it is not going to be as regular an income as the other will be if I get
that; I have applied for it. The snakes transact their end of the
business in a more orderly and systematic way than the government
transacts its end of it, because the snakes have had a long experience
and know all about the traffic. You can make sure that the government
will never kill fewer than 110,000 snakes in a year, and that it will
newer quite reach 300,000 too much room for oscillation; good
speculative stock, to bear or bull, and buy and sell long and short, and
all that kind of thing, but not eligible for investment like the other.
The man that speculates in the government’s snake crop wants to go
carefully. I would not advise a man to buy a single crop at all–I mean a
crop of futures for the possible wobble is something quite
extraordinary. If he can buy six future crops in a bunch, seller to
deliver 1,500,000 altogether, that is another matter. I do not know what
snakes are worth now, but I know what they would be worth then, for the
statistics show that the seller could not come within 427,000 of
carrying out his contract. However, I think that a person who speculates
in snakes is a fool, anyway. He always regrets it afterwards.</p>
<p>To finish the statistics. In six years the wild beasts kill 20,000
persons, and the snakes kill 103,000. In the same six the government
kills 1,073,546 snakes. Plenty left.</p>
<p>There are narrow escapes in India. In the very jungle where I killed
sixteen tigers and all those elephants, a cobra bit me but it got well;
everyone was surprised. This could not happen twice in ten years,
perhaps. Usually death would result in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>We struck out westward or northwestward from Calcutta on an itinerary
of a zig-zag sort, which would in the course of time carry us across
India to its northwestern corner and the border of Afghanistan. The
first part of the trip carried us through a great region which was an
endless garden–miles and miles of the beautiful flower from whose juices
comes the opium, and at Muzaffurpore we were in the midst of the indigo
culture; thence by a branch road to the Ganges at a point near Dinapore,
and by a train which would have missed the connection by a week but for
the thoughtfulness of some British officers who were along, and who knew
the ways of trains that are run by natives without white supervision.
This train stopped at every village; for no purpose connected with
business, apparently. We put out nothing, we took nothing aboard. The
train bands stepped ashore and gossiped with friends a quarter of an
hour, then pulled out and repeated this at the succeeding villages. We
had thirty-five miles to go and six hours to do it in, but it was plain
that we were not going to make it. It was then that the English officers
said it was now necessary to turn this gravel train into an express. So
they gave the engine-driver a rupee and told him to fly. It was a simple
remedy. After that we made ninety miles an hour. We crossed the Ganges
just at dawn, made our connection, and went to Benares, where we stayed
twenty-four hours and inspected that strange and fascinating piety-hive
again; then left for Lucknow, a city which is perhaps the most
conspicuous of the many monuments of British fortitude and valor that
are scattered about the earth.</p>
<p>The heat was pitiless, the flat plains were destitute of grass, and
baked dry by the sun they were the color of pale dust, which was flying
in clouds. But it was much hotter than this when the relieving forces
marched to Lucknow in the time of the Mutiny. Those were the days of 138
deg. in the shade.</p>
