<h4 id="concerning-chambermaids">CONCERNING CHAMBERMAIDS</h4>
<p>Against all chambermaids, of whatsoever age or nationality, I launch
the curse of bachelordom! Because:</p>
<p>They always put the pillows at the opposite end of the bed from the
gas-burner, so that while you read and smoke before sleeping (as is the
ancient and honored custom of bachelors), you have to hold your book
aloft, in an uncomfortable position, to keep the light from dazzling
your eyes.</p>
<p>When they find the pillows removed to the other end of the bed in the
morning, they receive not the suggestion in a friendly spirit; but,
glorying in their absolute sovereignty, and unpitying your helplessness,
they make the bed just as it was originally, and gloat in secret over
the pang their tyranny will cause you.</p>
<p>Always after that, when they find you have transposed the pillows,
they undo your work, and thus defy and seek to embitter the life that
God has given you.</p>
<p>If they cannot get the light in an inconvenient position any other
way, they move the bed.</p>
<p>If you pull your trunk out six inches from the wall, so that the lid
will stay up when you open it, they always shove that trunk back again.
They do it on purpose.</p>
<p>If you want the spittoon in a certain spot, where it will be handy,
they don’t, and so they move it.</p>
<p>They always put your other boots into inaccessible places. They
chiefly enjoy depositing them as far under the bed as the wall will
permit. It is because this compels you to get down in an undignified
attitude and make wild sweeps for them in the dark with the bootjack,
and swear.</p>
<p>They always put the matchbox in some other place. They hunt up a new
place for it every day, and put up a bottle, or other perishable glass
thing, where the box stood before. This is to cause you to break that
glass thing, groping in the dark, and get yourself into trouble.</p>
<p>They are for ever and ever moving the furniture. When you come in in
the night you can calculate on finding the bureau where the wardrobe was
in the morning. And when you go out in the morning, if you leave the
slop-bucket by the door and rocking-chair by the window, when you come
in at midnight or thereabout, you will fall over that rocking-chair, and
you will proceed toward the window and sit down in that slop-tub. This
will disgust you. They like that.</p>
<p>No matter where you put anything, they are not going to let it stay
there. They will take it and move it the first chance they get. It is
their nature. And, besides, it gives them pleasure to be mean and
contrary this way. They would die if they couldn’t be villains.</p>
<p>They always save up all the old scraps of printed rubbish you throw
on the floor, and stack them up carefully on the table, and start the
fire with your valuable manuscripts. If there is any one particular old
scrap that you are more down on than any other, and which you are
gradually wearing your life out trying to get rid of, you may take all
the pains you possibly can in that direction, but it won’t be of any
use, because they will always fetch that old scrap back and put it in
the same old place again every time. It does them good.</p>
<p>And they use up more hair-oil than any six men. If charged with
purloining the same, they lie about it. What do they care about a
hereafter? Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>If you leave the key in the door for convenience’ sake, they will
carry it down to the office and give it to the clerk. They do this under
the vile pretense of trying to protect your property from thieves; but
actually they do it because they want to make you tramp back down-stairs
after it when you come home tired, or put you to the trouble of sending
a waiter for it, which waiter will expect you to pay him something. In
which case I suppose the degraded creatures divide.</p>
<p>They keep always trying to make your bed before you get up, thus
destroying your rest and inflicting agony upon you; but after you get
up, they don’t come any more till next day.</p>
<p>They do all the mean things they can think of, and they do them just
out of pure cussedness, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Chambermaids are dead to every human instinct.</p>
<p>If I can get a bill through the legislature abolishing chambermaids,
I mean to do it.</p>
<p>AURELIA’S UNFORTUNATE YOUNG MAN–[Written about 1865.]</p>
<p>The facts in the following case came to me by letter from a young
lady who lives in the beautiful city of San Jose; she is perfectly
unknown to me, and simply signs herself “Aurelia Maria,“ which may
possibly be a fictitious name. But no matter, the poor girl is almost
heartbroken by the misfortunes she has undergone, and so confused by the
conflicting counsels of misguided friends and insidious enemies that she
does not know what course to pursue in order to extricate herself from
the web of difficulties in which she seems almost hopelessly involved.
In this dilemma she turns to me for help, and supplicates for my
guidance and instruction with a moving eloquence that would touch the
heart of a statue. Hear her sad story:</p>
<p>She says that when she was sixteen years old she met and loved, with
all the devotion of a passionate nature, a young man from New Jersey,
named Williamson Breckinridge Caruthers, who was some six years her
senior. They were engaged, with the free consent of their friends and
relatives, and for a time it seemed as if their career was destined to,
be characterized by an immunity from sorrow beyond the usual lot of
humanity. But at last the tide of fortune turned; young Caruthers became
infect with smallpox of the most virulent type, and when he recovered
from his illness his face was pitted like a waffle-mold, and his
comeliness gone forever. Aurelia thought to break off the engagement at
first, but pity for her unfortunate lover caused her to postpone the
marriage-day for a season, and give him another trial.</p>
<p>The very day before the wedding was to have taken place,
Breckinridge, while absorbed in watching the flight of a balloon, walked
into a well and fractured one of his legs, and it had to be taken off
above the knee. Again Aurelia was moved to break the engagement, but
again love triumphed, and she set the day forward and gave him another
chance to reform.</p>
<p>And again misfortune overtook the unhappy youth. He lost one arm by
the premature discharge of a Fourth of July cannon, and within three
months he got the other pulled out by a carding-machine. Aurelia’s heart
was almost crushed by these latter calamities. She could not but be
deeply grieved to see her lover passing from her by piecemeal, feeling,
as she did, that he could not last forever under this disastrous process
of reduction, yet knowing of no way to stop its dreadful career, and in
her tearful despair she almost regretted, like brokers who hold on and
lose, that she had not taken him at first, before he had suffered such
an alarming depreciation. Still, her brave soul bore her up, and she
resolved to bear with her friend’s unnatural disposition yet a little
longer.</p>
<p>Again the wedding-day approached, and again disappointment
overshadowed it; Caruthers fell ill with the erysipelas, and lost the
use of one of his eyes entirely. The friends and relatives of the bride,
considering that she had already put up with more than could reasonably
be expected of her, now came forward and insisted that the match should
be broken off; but after wavering awhile, Aurelia, with a generous
spirit which did her credit, said she had reflected calmly upon the
matter, and could not discover that Breckinridge was to blame.</p>
<p>So she extended the time once more, and he broke his other leg.</p>
<p>It was a sad day for the poor girl when, she saw the surgeons
reverently bearing away the sack whose uses she had learned by previous
experience, and her heart told her the bitter truth that some more of
her lover was gone. She felt that the field of her affections was
growing more and more circumscribed every day, but once more she frowned
down her relatives and renewed her betrothal.</p>
<p>Shortly before the time set for the nuptials another disaster
occurred. There was but one man scalped by the Owens River Indians last
year. That man was Williamson Breckinridge Caruthers of New Jersey. He
was hurrying home with happiness in his heart, when he lost his hair
forever, and in that hour of bitterness he almost cursed the mistaken
mercy that had spared his head.</p>
<p>At last Aurelia is in serious perplexity as to what she ought to do.
She still loves her Breckinridge, she writes, with truly womanly
feeling–she still loves what is left of him but her parents are bitterly
opposed to the match, because he has no property and is disabled from
working, and she has not sufficient means to support both comfortably.
“Now, what should she do?“ she asked with painful and anxious
solicitude.</p>
<p>It is a delicate question; it is one which involves the lifelong
happiness of a woman, and that of nearly two-thirds of a man, and I feel
that it would be assuming too great a responsibility to do more than
make a mere suggestion in the case. How would it do to build to him? If
Aurelia can afford the expense, let her furnish her mutilated lover with
wooden arms and wooden legs, and a glass eye and a wig, and give him
another show; give him ninety days, without grace, and if he does not
break his neck in the mean time, marry him and take the chances. It does
not seem to me that there is much risk, anyway, Aurelia, because if he
sticks to his singular propensity for damaging himself every time he
sees a good opportunity, his next experiment is bound to finish him, and
then you are safe, married or single. If married, the wooden legs and
such other valuables as he may possess revert to the widow, and you see
you sustain no actual loss save the cherished fragment of a noble but
most unfortunate husband, who honestly strove to do right, but whose
extraordinary instincts were against him. Try it, Maria. I have thought
the matter over carefully and well, and it is the only chance I see for
you. It would have been a happy conceit on the part of Caruthers if he
had started with his neck and broken that first; but since he has seen
fit to choose a different policy and string himself out as long as
possible, I do not think we ought to upbraid him for it if he has
enjoyed it. We must do the best we can under the circumstances, and try
not to feel exasperated at him.</p>
