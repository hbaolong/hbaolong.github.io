<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>SUPERNATURAL CHRONOMETRY</p>
<p>Rowena was dining out, Joe and Harry were belated at play, there were
but three chairs and four persons that noon at the home dinner-table–the
twins, the widow, and her chum, Aunt Betsy Hale. The widow soon
perceived that Angelo’s spirits were as low as Luigi’s were high, and
also that he had a jaded look. Her motherly solicitude was aroused, and
she tried to get him interested in the talk and win him to a happier
frame of mind, but the cloud of sadness remained on his countenance.
Luigi lent his help, too. He used a form and a phrase which he was
always accustomed to employ in these circumstances. He gave his brother
an affectionate slap on the shoulder and said, encouragingly:</p>
<p>“Cheer up, the worst is yet to come!“</p>
<p>But this did no good. It never did. If anything, it made the matter
worse, as a rule, because it irritated Angelo. This made it a favorite
with Luigi. By and by the widow said:</p>
<p>“Angelo, you are tired, you’ve overdone yourself; you go right to bed
after dinner, and get a good nap and a rest, then you’ll be all
right.“</p>
<p>“Indeed, I would give anything if I could do that, madam.“</p>
<p>“And what’s to hender, I’d like to know? Land, the room’s yours to do
what you please with! The idea that you can’t do what you like with your
own!“</p>
<p>“But, you see, there’s one prime essential–an essential of the very
first importance–which isn’t my own.“</p>
<p>“What is that?“</p>
<p>“My body.“</p>
<p>The old ladies looked puzzled, and Aunt Betsy Hale said:</p>
<p>“Why bless your heart, how is that?“</p>
<p>“It’s my brother’s.“</p>
<p>“Your brother’s! I don’t quite understand. I supposed it belonged to
both of you.“</p>
<p>“So it does. But not to both at the same time.“</p>
<p>“That is mighty curious; I don’t see how it can be. I shouldn’t think
it could be managed that way.“</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s a good enough arrangement, and goes very well; in fact, it
wouldn’t do to have it otherwise. I find that the teetotalers and the
anti-teetotalers hire the use of the same hall for their meetings. Both
parties don’t use it at the same time, do they?“</p>
<p>“You bet they don’t!“ said both old ladies in a breath.</p>
<p>“And, moreover,“ said Aunt Betsy, “the Freethinkers and the Baptist
Bible class use the same room over the Market house, but you can take my
word for it they don’t mush up together and use it at the same
time.’</p>
<p>“Very well,“ said Angelo, “you understand it now. And it stands to
reason that the arrangement couldn’t be improved. I’ll prove it to you.
If our legs tried to obey two wills, how could we ever get anywhere? I
would start one way, Luigi would start another, at the same moment –the
result would be a standstill, wouldn’t it?“</p>
<p>“As sure as you are born! Now ain’t that wonderful! A body would
never have thought of it.“</p>
<p>“We should always be arguing and fussing and disputing over the
merest trifles. We should lose worlds of time, for we couldn’t go
down-stairs or up, couldn’t go to bed, couldn’t rise, couldn’t wash,
couldn’t dress, couldn’t stand up, couldn’t sit down, couldn’t even
cross our legs, without calling a meeting first and explaining the case
and passing resolutions, and getting consent. It wouldn’t ever do–now
would it?“</p>
<p>“Do? Why, it would wear a person out in a week! Did you ever hear
anything like it, Patsy Cooper?“</p>
<p>“Oh, you’ll find there’s more than one thing about them that ain’t
commonplace,“ said the widow, with the complacent air of a person with a
property right in a novelty that is under admiring scrutiny.</p>
<p>“Well, now, how ever do you manage it? I don’t mind saying I’m
suffering to know.“</p>
<p>“He who made us,“ said Angelo reverently, “and with us this
difficulty, also provided a way out of it. By a mysterious law of our
being, each of us has utter and indisputable command of our body a week
at a time, turn and turn about.“</p>
<p>“Well, I never! Now ain’t that beautiful!“</p>
<p>“Yes, it is beautiful and infinitely wise and just. The week ends
every Saturday at midnight to the minute, to the second, to the last
shade of a fraction of a second, infallibly, unerringly, and in that
instant the one brother’s power over the body vanishes and the other
brother takes possession, asleep or awake.“</p>
<p>“How marvelous are His ways, and past finding out!“</p>
<p>Luigi said: “So exactly to the instant does the change come, that
during our stay in many of the great cities of the world, the public
clocks were regulated by it; and as hundreds of thousands of private
clocks and watches were set and corrected in accordance with the public
clocks, we really furnished the standard time for the entire city.“</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me that He don’t do miracles any more! Blowing down the
walls of Jericho with rams’ horns wa’n’t as difficult, in my
opinion.“</p>
<p>“And that is not all,“ said Angelo. “A thing that is even more
marvelous, perhaps, is the fact that the change takes note of longitude
and fits itself to the meridian we are on. Luigi is in command this
week. Now, if on Saturday night at a moment before midnight we could fly
in an instant to a point fifteen degrees west of here, he would hold
possession of the power another hour, for the change observes local time
and no other.“</p>
<p>Betsy Hale was deeply impressed, and said with solemnity:</p>
<p>“Patsy Cooper, for detail it lays over the Passage of the Red
Sea.“</p>
<p>“Now, I shouldn’t go as far as that,“ said Aunt Patsy, “but if you’ve
a mind to say Sodom and Gomorrah, I am with you, Betsy Hale.“</p>
<p>“I am agreeable, then, though I do think I was right, and I believe
Parson Maltby would say the same. Well, now, there’s another thing.
Suppose one of you wants to borrow the legs a minute from the one that’s
got them, could he let him?“</p>
<p>“Yes, but we hardly ever do that. There were disagreeable results,
several times, and so we very seldom ask or grant the privilege,
nowadays, and we never even think of such a thing unless the case is
extremely urgent. Besides, a week’s possession at a time seems so little
that we can’t bear to spare a minute of it. People who have the use of
their legs all the time never think of what a blessing it is, of course.
It never occurs to them; it’s just their natural ordinary condition, and
so it does not excite them at all. But when I wake up, on Sunday
morning, and it’s my week and I feel the power all through me, oh, such
a wave of exultation and thanksgiving goes surging over me, and I want
to shout ‘I can walk! I can walk!’ Madam, do you ever, at your uprising,
want to shout ‘I can walk! I can walk!’?“</p>
<p>“No, you poor unfortunate cretur’, but I’ll never get out of my bed
again without doing it! Laws, to think I’ve had this unspeakable
blessing all my long life and never had the grace to thank the good Lord
that gave it to me!“</p>
<p>Tears stood in the eyes of both the old ladies and the widow said,
softly:</p>
<p>“Betsy Hale, we have learned something, you and me.“</p>
<p>The conversation now drifted wide, but by and by floated back once
more to that admired detail, the rigid and beautiful impartiality with
which the possession of power had been distributed, between the twins.
Aunt Betsy saw in it a far finer justice than human law exhibits in
related cases. She said:</p>
<p>“In my opinion it ain’t right no, and never has been right, the way a
twin born a quarter of a minute sooner than the other one gets all the
land and grandeurs and nobilities in the old countries and his brother
has to go bare and be a nobody. Which of you was born first?“</p>
<p>Angelo’s head was resting against Luigi’s; weariness had overcome
him, and for the past five minutes he had been peacefully sleeping. The
old ladies had dropped their voices to a lulling drone, to help him to
steal the rest his brother wouldn’t take him up-stairs to get. Luigi
listened a moment to Angelo’s regular breathing, then said in a voice
barely audible:</p>
<p>“We were both born at the same time, but I am six months older than
he is.“</p>
<p>“For the land’s sake!“</p>
<p>“’Sh! on’t wake him up; he wouldn’t like my telling this. It has
always been kept secret till now.“</p>
<p>“But how in the world can it be? If you were both born at the same
time, how can one of you be older than the other?“</p>
<p>“It is very simple, and I assure you it is true. I was born with a
full crop of hair, he was as bald as an egg for six months. I could walk
six months before he could make a step. I finished teething six months
ahead of him. I began to take solids six months before he left the
breast. I began to talk six months before he could say a word. Last, and
absolutely unassailable proof, the sutures in my skull closed six months
ahead of his. Always just that six months’ difference to a day. Was that
accident? Nobody is going to claim that, I’m sure. It was ordained it
was law it had its meaning, and we know what that meaning was. Now what
does this overwhelming body of evidence establish? It establishes just
one thing, and that thing it establishes beyond any peradventure
whatever. Friends, we would not have it known for the world, and I must
beg you to keep it strictly to yourselves, but the truth is, we are no
more twins than you are.“</p>
<p>The two old ladies were stunned, paralyzed-petrified, one may almost
say –and could only sit and gaze vacantly at each other for some
moments; then Aunt Betsy Hale said impressively:</p>
<p>“There’s no getting around proof like that. I do believe it’s the
most amazing thing I ever heard of.“ She sat silent a moment or two and
breathing hard with excitement, then she looked up and surveyed the
strangers steadfastly a little while, and added: “Well, it does beat me,
but I would have took you for twins anywhere.“</p>
<p>“So would I, so would I,“ said Aunt Patsy with the emphasis of a
certainty that is not impaired by any shade of doubt.</p>
<p>“Anybody would-anybody in the world, I don’t care who he is,“ said
Aunt Betsy with decision.</p>
<p>“You won’t tell,“ said Luigi, appealingly.</p>
<p>“Oh, dear, no!“ answered both ladies promptly, “you can trust us,
don’t you be afraid.“</p>
<p>“That is good of you, and kind. Never let on; treat us always as if
we were twins.“</p>
<p>“You can depend on us,“ said Aunt Betsy, “but it won’t be easy,
because now that I know you ain’t you don’t seem so.“</p>
<p>Luigi muttered to himself with satisfaction: “That swindle has gone
through without change of cars.“</p>
<p>It was not very kind of him to load the poor things up with a secret
like that, which would be always flying to their tongues’ ends every
time they heard any one speak of the strangers as twins, and would
become harder and harder to hang on to with every recurrence of the
temptation to tell it, while the torture of retaining it would increase
with every new strain that was applied; but he never thought of that,
and probably would not have worried much about it if he had.</p>
<p>A visitor was announced–some one to see the twins. They withdrew to
the parlor, and the two old ladies began to discuss with interest the
strange things which they had been listening to. When they had finished
the matter to their satisfaction, and Aunt Betsy rose to go, she stopped
to ask a question:</p>
<p>“How does things come on between Roweny and Tom Driscoll?“</p>
<p>“Well, about the same. He writes tolerable often, and she answers
tolerable seldom.“</p>
<p>“Where is he?“</p>
<p>“In St. Louis, I believe, though he’s such a gadabout that a body
can’t be very certain of him, I reckon.“</p>
<p>“Don’t Roweny know?“</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, like enough. I haven’t asked her lately.“</p>
<p>“Do you know how him and the judge are getting along now?“</p>
<p>“First rate, I believe. Mrs. Pratt says so; and being right in the
house, and sister to the one and aunt to t’other, of course she ought to
know. She says the judge is real fond of him when he’s away; but frets
when he’s around and is vexed with his ways, and not sorry to have him
go again. He has been gone three weeks this time–a pleasant thing for
both of them, I reckon.“</p>
<p>“Tom’s rather harum-scarum, but there ain’t anything bad in him, I
guess.“</p>
<p>“Oh, no, he’s just young, that’s all. Still, twenty-three is old, in
one way. A young man ought to be earning his living by that time. If Tom
were doing that, or was even trying to do it, the judge would be a heap
better satisfied with him. Tom’s always going to begin, but somehow he
can’t seem to find just the opening he likes.“</p>
<p>“Well, now, it’s partly the judge’s own fault. Promising the boy his
property wasn’t the way to set him to earning a fortune of his own. But
what do you think is Roweny beginning to lean any toward him, or ain’t
she?“</p>
<p>Aunt Patsy had a secret in her bosom; she wanted to keep it there,
but nature was too strong for her. She drew Aunt Betsy aside, and said
in her most confidential and mysterious manner:</p>
<p>“Don’t you breathe a syllable to a soul–I’m going to tell you
something. In my opinion Tom Driscoll’s chances were considerable better
yesterday than they are to-day.“</p>
<p>“Patsy Cooper, what do you mean?“</p>
<p>“It’s so, as sure as you’re born. I wish you could ‘a’ been at
breakfast and seen for yourself.“</p>
<p>“You don’t mean it!“</p>
<p>“Well, if I’m any judge, there’s a leaning–there’s a leaning,
sure.“</p>
<p>“My land! Which one of ’em is it?“</p>
<p>“I can’t say for certain, but I think it’s the youngest
one–Anjy.“</p>
<p>Then there were hand-shakings, and congratulations, and hopes, and so
on, and the old ladies parted, perfectly happy–the one in knowing
something which the rest of the town didn’t, and the other in having
been the sole person able to furnish that knowledge.</p>
<p>The visitor who had called to see the twins was the
Rev. Mr. Hotchkiss, pastor of the Baptist church. At the reception
Angelo had told him he had lately experienced a change in his religious
views, and was now desirous of becoming a Baptist, and would immediately
join Mr. Hotchkiss’s church. There was no time to say more, and the
brief talk ended at that point. The minister was much gratified, and had
dropped in for a moment now, to invite the twins to attend his Bible
class at eight that evening. Angelo accepted, and was expecting Luigi to
decline, but he did not, because he knew that the Bible class and the
Freethinkers met in the same room, and he wanted to treat his brother to
the embarrassment of being caught in free-thinking company.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>GUILT AND INNOCENCE FINELY BLENT</p>
<p>[A long and vigorous quarrel follows, between the twins. And there is
plenty to quarrel about, for Angelo was always seeking truth, and this
obliged him to change and improve his religion with frequency, which
wearied Luigi, and annoyed him too; for he had to be present at each new
enlistment–which placed him in the false position of seeming to indorse
and approve his brother’s fickleness; moreover, he had to go to Angelo’s
prohibition meetings, and he hated them. On the other hand, when it was
his week to command the legs he gave Angelo just cause of complaint, for
he took him to circuses and horse-races and fandangoes, exposing him to
all sorts of censure and criticism; and he drank, too; and whatever he
drank went to Angelo’s head instead of his own and made him act
disgracefully. When the evening was come, the two attended the
Free-thinkers’ meeting, where Angelo was sad and silent; then came the
Bible class and looked upon him coldly, finding him in such company.
Then they went to Wilson’s house and Chapter XI of Pudd’nhead Wilson
follows, which tells of the girl seen in Tom Driscoll’s room; and closes
with the kicking of Tom by Luigi at the anti-temperance mass-meeting of
the Sons of Liberty; with the addition of some account of Roxy’s
adventures as a chamber-maid on a Mississippi boat. Her exchange of the
children had been flippantly and farcically described in an earlier
chapter.]</p>
<p>Next morning all the town was a-buzz with great news; Pudd’nhead
Wilson had a law case! The, public astonishment was so great and the
public curiosity so intense, that when the justice of the peace opened
his court, the place was packed with people and even the windows were
full. Everybody was, flushed and perspiring; the summer heat was almost
unendurable.</p>
<p>Tom Driscoll had brought a charge of assault and battery against the
twins. Robert Allen was retained by Driscoll, David Wilson by the
defense. Tom, his native cheerfulness unannihilated by his back-breaking
and bone-bruising passage across the massed heads of the Sons of Liberty
the previous night, laughed his little customary laugh, and said to
Wilson:</p>
<p>“I’ve kept my promise, you see; I’m throwing my business your way.
Sooner than I was expecting, too.“</p>
<p>“It’s very good of you–particularly if you mean to keep it up.“</p>
<p>“Well, I can’t tell about that yet. But we’ll see. If I find you
deserve it I’ll take you under my protection and make your fame and
fortune for you.“</p>
<p>“I’ll try to deserve it, Tom.“</p>
<p>A jury was sworn in; then Mr. Allen said:</p>
<p>“We will detain your honor but a moment with this case. It is not one
where any doubt of the fact of the assault can enter in. These
gentlemen–the accused–kicked my client at the Market Hall last night;
they kicked him with violence; with extraordinary violence; with even
unprecedented violence, I may say; insomuch that he was lifted entirely
off his feet and discharged into the midst of the audience. We can prove
this by four hundred witnesses–we shall call but three. Mr. Harkness
will take the stand.“</p>
<p>Mr. Harkness, being sworn, testified that he was chairman upon the
occasion mentioned; that he was close at hand and saw the defendants in
this action kick the plaintiff into the air and saw him descend among
the audience.</p>
<p>“Take the witness,“ said Allen.</p>
<p>“Mr. Harkness,“ said Wilson, “you say you saw these gentlemen, my
clients, kick the plaintiff. Are you sure–and please remember that you
are on oath–are you perfectly sure that you saw both of them kick him,
or only one? Now be careful.“</p>
<p>A bewildered look began to spread itself over the witness’s face. He
hesitated, stammered, but got out nothing. His eyes wandered to the
twins and fixed themselves there with a vacant gaze.</p>
<p>“Please answer, Mr. Harkness, you are keeping the court waiting. It
is a very simple question.“</p>
<p>Counsel for the prosecution broke in with impatience:</p>
<p>“Your honor, the question is an irrelevant triviality. Necessarily,
they both kicked him, for they have but the one pair of legs, and both
are responsible for them.“</p>
<p>Wilson said, sarcastically:</p>
<p>“Will your honor permit this new witness to be sworn? He seems to
possess knowledge which can be of the utmost value just at this moment
–knowledge which would at once dispose of what every one must see is a
very difficult question in this case. Brother Allen, will you take the
stand?“</p>
<p>“Go on with your case!“ said Allen, petulantly. The audience laughed,
and got a warning from the court.</p>
<p>“Now, Mr. Harkness,“ said Wilson, insinuatingly, “we shall have to
insist upon an answer to that question.“</p>
<p>“I–er–well, of course, I do not absolutely know, but in my
opinion–“</p>
<p>“Never mind your opinion, sir–answer the question.“</p>
<p>“I–why, I can’t answer it.“</p>
<p>“That will do, Mr. Harkness. Stand down.“</p>
<p>The audience tittered, and the discomfited witness retired in a state
of great embarrassment.</p>
<p>Mr. Wakeman took the stand and swore that he saw the twins kick the
plaintiff off the platform.</p>
<p>The defense took the witness.</p>
<p>“Mr. Wakeman, you have sworn that you saw these gentlemen kick the
plaintiff. Do I understand you to swear that you saw them both do
it?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,“–with derision.</p>
<p>“How do you know that both did it?“</p>
<p>“Because I saw them do it.“</p>
<p>The audience laughed, and got another warning from the court.</p>
<p>“But by what means do you know that both, and not one, did it?“</p>
<p>“Well, in the first place, the insult was given to both of them
equally, for they were called a pair of scissors. Of course they would
both want to resent it, and so–“</p>
<p>“Wait! You are theorizing now. Stick to facts–counsel will attend to
the arguments. Go on.“</p>
<p>“Well, they both went over there–that I saw.“</p>
<p>“Very good. Go on.“</p>
<p>“And they both kicked him–I swear to it.“</p>
<p>“Mr. Wakeman, was Count Luigi, here, willing to join the Sons of
Liberty last night?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, he was. He did join, too, and drank a glass or two of
whisky, like a man.“</p>
<p>“Was his brother willing to join?“</p>
<p>“No, sir, he wasn’t. He is a teetotaler, and was elected through a
mistake.“</p>
<p>“Was he given a glass of whisky?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, but of course that was another mistake, and not
intentional. He wouldn’t drink it. He set it down.“ A slight pause, then
he added, casually and quite simply: “The plaintiff reached for it and
hogged it.“</p>
<p>There was a fine outburst of laughter, but as the justice was caught
out himself, his reprimand was not very vigorous.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen jumped up and exclaimed: “I protest against these foolish
irrelevancies. What have they to do with the case?“</p>
<p>Wilson said: “Calm yourself, brother, it was only an experiment. Now,
Mr. Wakeman, if one of these gentlemen chooses to join an association
and the other doesn’t; and if one of them enjoys whisky and the other
doesn’t, but sets it aside and leaves it unprotected“ (titter from the
audience), “it seems to show that they have independent minds, and
tastes, and preferences, and that one of them is able to approve of a
thing at the very moment that the other is heartily disapproving of it.
Doesn’t it seem so to you?“</p>
<p>“Certainly it does. It’s perfectly plain.“</p>
<p>“Now, then, it might be–I only say it might be–that one of these
brothers wanted to kick the plaintiff last night, and that the other
didn’t want that humiliating punishment inflicted upon him in that
public way and before all those people. Isn’t that possible?“</p>
<p>“Of course it is. It’s more than possible. I don’t believe the blond
one would kick anybody. It was the other one that–“</p>
<p>“Silence!“ shouted the plaintiff’s counsel, and went on with an angry
sentence which was lost in the wave of laughter that swept the
house.</p>
<p>“That will do, Mr. Wakeman,“ said Wilson, “you may stand down.“</p>
<p>The third witness was called. He had seen the twins kick the
plaintiff. Mr. Wilson took the witness.</p>
<p>“Mr. Rogers, you say you saw these accused gentlemen kick the
plaintiff?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“Both of them?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“Which of them kicked him first?“</p>
<p>“Why–they–they both kicked him at the same time.</p>
<p>“Are you perfectly sure of that?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“What makes you sure of it?“</p>
<p>“Why, I stood right behind them, and saw them do it.“</p>
<p>“How many kicks were delivered?“</p>
<p>“Only one.“</p>
<p>“If two men kick, the result should be two kicks, shouldn’t it?“</p>
<p>“Why–why yes, as a rule.“</p>
<p>“Then what do you think went with the other kick?“</p>
<p>“I–well–the fact is, I wasn’t thinking of two being necessary, this
time.“</p>
<p>“What do you think now?“</p>
<p>“Well, I–I’m sure I don’t quite know what to think, but I reckon that
one of them did half of the kick and the other one did the other
half.“</p>
<p>Somebody in the crowd sung out: “It’s the first sane thing that any
of them has said.“</p>
<p>The audience applauded. The judge said: “Silence! or I will clear the
court.“</p>
<p>Mr. Allen looked pleased, but Wilson did not seem disturbed. He
said:</p>
<p>“Mr. Rogers, you have favored us with what you think and what you
reckon, but as thinking and reckoning are not evidence, I will now give
you a chance to come out with something positive, one way or the other,
and shall require you to produce it. I will ask the accused to stand up
and repeat the phenomenal kick of last night.“ The twins stood up. “Now,
Mr. Rogers, please stand behind them.“</p>
<p>A Voice: “No, stand in front!“ (Laughter. Silenced by the court.)
Another Voice: “No, give Tommy another highst!“ (Laughter. Sharply
rebuked by the court.)</p>
<p>“Now, then, Mr. Rogers, two kicks shall be delivered, one after the
other, and I give you my word that at least one of the two shall be
delivered by one of the twins alone, without the slightest assistance
from his brother. Watch sharply, for you have of to render a decision
without any if’s and ands it.“ Rogers bent himself behind the twins with
palms just above his knees, in the modern attitude of the catcher at a
baseball match, and riveted eyes on the pair of legs in front of
him.</p>
<p>“Are you ready, Mr. Rogers?“</p>
<p>“Ready sir.“</p>
<p>The kick, launched.</p>
<p>“Have you got that one classified, Mr. Rogers?“</p>
<p>“Let me study a minute, sir.“</p>
<p>“Take as much time as you please. Let me know when you are
ready.“</p>
<p>For as much as a minute Rogers pondered, with all eyes and a
breathless interest fastened upon him. Then he gave the word: “Ready,
sir.“</p>
<p>“Kick!“</p>
<p>The kick that followed was an exact duplicate of the first one.</p>
<p>“Now, then, Mr. Rogers, one of those kicks was an individual kick,
not a mutual one. You will now state positively which was the mutual
one.“</p>
<p>The witness said, with a crestfallen look:</p>
<p>“I’ve got to give it up. There ain’t any man in the world that could
tell t’other from which, sir.“</p>
<p>“Do you still assert that last night’s kick was a mutual kick?“</p>
<p>“Indeed, I don’t, sir.“</p>
<p>“That will do, Mr. Rogers. If my brother Allen desires to address the
court, your honor, very well; but as far as I am concerned I am ready to
let the case be at once delivered into the hands of this intelligent
jury without comment.“</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Robinson had been in office only two months, and in that
short time had not had many cases to try, of course. He had no knowledge
of laws and courts except what he had picked up since he came into
office. He was a sore trouble to the lawyers, for his rulings were
pretty eccentric sometimes, and he stood by them with Roman simplicity
and fortitude; but the people were well satisfied with him, for they saw
that his intentions were always right, that he was entirely impartial,
and that he usually made up in good sense what he lacked in technique,
so to speak. He now perceived that there was likely to be a miscarriage
of justice here, and he rose to the occasion.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment, gentlemen,“ he said, “it is plain that an assault has
been committed it is plain to anybody; but the way things are going, the
guilty will certainly escape conviction. I can not allow this. Now—“</p>
<p>“But, your honor!“ said Wilson, interrupting him, earnestly but
respectfully, “you are deciding the case yourself, whereas the
jury–“</p>
<p>“Never mind the jury, Mr. Wilson; the jury will have a chance when
there is a reasonable doubt for them to take hold of–which there isn’t,
so far. There is no doubt whatever that an assault has been committed.
The attempt to show that both of the accused committed it has failed.
Are they both to escape justice on that account? Not in this court, if I
can prevent it. It appears to have been a mistake to bring the charge
against them as a corporation; each should have been charged in his
capacity as an individual, and–“</p>
<p>“But, your honor!“ said Wilson, “in fairness to my clients I must
insist that inasmuch as the prosecution ’d not separate the–“</p>
<p>“No wrong will be done your clients, sir–they will be protected; also
the public and the offended laws. Mr. Allen, you will amend your
pleadings, and put one of the accused on trial at a time.“</p>
<p>Wilson broke in: “But, your honor! this is wholly unprecedented! To
imperil an accused person by arbitrarily altering and widening the
charge against him in order to compass his conviction when the charge as
originally brought promises to fail to convict, is a thing unheard of
before.“</p>
<p>“Unheard of where?“</p>
<p>“In the courts of this or any other state.“</p>
<p>The judge said with dignity: “I am not acquainted with the customs of
other courts, and am not concerned to know what they are. I am
responsible for this court, and I cannot conscientiously allow my
judgment to be warped and my judicial liberty hampered by trying to
conform to the caprices of other courts, be they–“</p>
<p>“But, your honor, the oldest and highest courts in Europe–“</p>
<p>“This court is not run on the European plan, Mr. Wilson; it is not
run on any plan but its own. It has a plan of its own; and that plan is,
to find justice for both State and accused, no matter what happens to be
practice and custom in Europe or anywhere else.“ (Great applause.)
“Silence! It has not been the custom of this court to imitate other
courts; it has not been the custom of this court to take shelter behind
the decisions of other courts, and we will not begin now. We will do the
best we can by the light that God has given us, and while this ’court
continues to have His approval, it will remain indifferent to what other
organizations may think of it.“ (Applause.) “Gentlemen, I must have
order!–quiet yourselves! Mr. Allen, you will now proceed against the
prisoners one at a time. Go on with the case.“</p>
<p>Allen was not at his ease. However, after whispering a moment with
his client and with one or two other people, he rose and said:</p>
<p>“Your honor, I find it to be reported and believed that the accused
are able to act independently in many ways, but that this independence
does not extend to their legs, authority over their legs being vested
exclusively in the one brother during a specific term of days, and then
passing to the other brother for a like term, and so on, by regular
alternation. I could call witnesses who would prove that the accused had
revealed to them the existence of this extraordinary fact, and had also
made known which of them was in possession of the legs yesterday–and
this would, of course, indicate where the guilt of the assault belongs
–but as this would be mere hearsay evidence, these revelations not
having been made under oath“</p>
<p>“Never mind about that, Mr. Allen. It may not all be hearsay. We
shall see. It may at least help to put us on the right track. Call the
witnesses.“</p>
<p>“Then I will call Mr. John Buckstone, who is now present, and I beg
that Mrs. Patsy Cooper may be sent for. Take the stand,
Mr. Buckstone.“</p>
<p>Buckstone took the oath, and then testified that on the previous
evening the Count Angelo Capello had protested against going to the
hall, and had called all present to witness that he was going by
compulsion and would not go if he could help himself. Also, that the
Count Luigi had replied sharply that he would go, just the same, and
that he, Count Luigi, would see to that himself. Also, that upon Count
Angelo’s complaining about being kept on his legs so long, Count Luigi
retorted with apparent surprise, “Your legs!–I like your impudence!“</p>
<p>“Now we are getting at the kernel of the thing,“ observed the judge,
with grave and earnest satisfaction. “It looks as if the Count Luigi was
in possession of the battery at the time of the assault.“</p>
<p>Nothing further was elicited from Mr. Buckstone on direct
examination. Mr. Wilson took the witness.</p>
<p>“Mr. Buckstone, about what time was it that that conversation took
place?“</p>
<p>“Toward nine yesterday evening, sir.“</p>
<p>“Did you then proceed directly to the hall?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“How long did it take you to go there?“</p>
<p>“Well, we walked; and as it was from the extreme edge of the town,
and there was no hurry, I judge it took us about twenty minutes, maybe a
trifle more.“</p>
<p>“About what hour was the kick delivered?“</p>
<p>“About thirteen minutes and a half to ten.“</p>
<p>“Admirable! You are a pattern witness, Mr. Buckstone. How did you
happen to look at your watch at that particular moment?“</p>
<p>“I always do it when I see an assault. It’s likely I shall be called
as a witness, and it’s a good point to have.“</p>
<p>“It would be well if others were as thoughtful. Was anything said,
between the conversation at my house and the assault, upon the detail
which we are now examining into?“</p>
<p>“No, sir.“</p>
<p>“If power over the mutual legs was in the possession of one brother
at nine, and passed into the possession of the other one during the next
thirty or forty minutes, do you think you could have detected the
change?“</p>
<p>“By no means!“</p>
<p>“That is all, Mr. Buckstone.“</p>
<p>Mrs. Patsy Cooper was called. The crowd made way for her, and she
came smiling and bowing through the narrow human lane, with Betsy Hale,
as escort and support, smiling and bowing in her wake, the audience
breaking into welcoming cheers as the old favorites filed along. The
judge did not check this kindly demonstration of homage and affection,
but let it run its course unrebuked.</p>
<p>The old ladies stopped and shook hands with the twins with effusion,
then gave the judge a friendly nod, and bustled into the seats provided
for them. They immediately began to deliver a volley of eager questions
at the friends around them: “What is this thing for?“ “What is that
thing for?“ “Who is that young man that’s writing at the desk? Why, I
declare, it’s Jack Bunce! I thought he was sick.“ “Which is the jury?
Why, is that the jury? Billy Price and Job Turner, and Jack Lounsbury,
and–well, I never!“ “Now who would ever ‘a’ thought–“</p>
<p>But they were gently called to order at this point, and asked not to
talk in court. Their tongues fell silent, but the radiant interest in
their faces remained, and their gratitude for the blessing of a new
sensation and a novel experience still beamed undimmed from their eyes.
Aunt Patsy stood up and took the oath, and Mr. Allen explained the point
in issue, and asked her to go on now, in her own way, and throw as much
light upon it as she could. She toyed with her reticule a moment or two,
as if considering where to begin, then she said:</p>
<p>“Well, the way of it is this. They are Luigi’s legs a week at a time,
and then they are Angelo’s, and he can do whatever he wants to with
them.“</p>
<p>“You are making a mistake, Aunt Patsy Cooper,“ said the judge. “You
shouldn’t state that as a fact, because you don’t know it to be a
fact.“</p>
<p>“What’s the reason I don’t?“ said Aunt Patsy, bridling a little.</p>
<p>“What is the reason that you do know it?“</p>
<p>“The best in the world because they told me.“</p>
<p>“That isn’t a reason.“</p>
<p>“Well, for the land’s sake! Betsy Hale, do you hear that?“</p>
<p>“Hear it? I should think so,“ said Aunt Betsy, rising and facing the
court. “Why, Judge, I was there and heard it myself. Luigi says to
Angelo–no, it was Angelo said it to–“</p>
<p>“Come, come, Mrs. Hale, pray sit down, and–“</p>
<p>“Certainly, it’s all right, I’m going to sit down presently, but not
until I’ve–“</p>
<p>“But you must sit down!“</p>
<p>“Must! Well, upon my word if things ain’t getting to a pretty pass
when–“</p>
<p>The house broke into laughter, but was promptly brought to order, and
meantime Mr. Allen persuaded the old lady to take her seat. Aunt Patsy
continued:</p>
<p>“Yes, they told me that, and I know it’s true. They’re Luigi’s legs
this week, but–“</p>
<p>“Ah, they told you that, did they?“ said the Justice, with
interest.</p>
<p>“Well, no, I don’t know that they told me, but that’s neither here
nor there. I know, without that, that at dinner yesterday, Angelo was as
tired as a dog, and yet Luigi wouldn’t lend him the legs to go up-stairs
and take a nap with.“</p>
<p>“Did he ask for them?“</p>
<p>“Let me see–it seems to me, somehow, that–that–Aunt Betsy, do you
remember whether he–“</p>
<p>“Never mind about what Aunt Betsy remembers–she is not a witness; we
only want to know what you remember yourself,“ said the judge.</p>
<p>“Well, it does seem to, me that you are most cantankerously
particular about a little thing, Sim Robinson. Why, when I can’t
remember a thing myself, I always–“</p>
<p>“Ah, please go on!“</p>
<p>“Now how can she when you keep fussing at her all the time?“ said
Aunt Betsy. “Why, with a person pecking at me that way, I should get
that fuzzled and fuddled that–“</p>
<p>She was on her feet again, but Allen coaxed her into her seat once
more, while the court squelched the mirth of the house. Then the judge
said:</p>
<p>“Madam, do you know–do you absolutely know, independently of anything
these gentlemen have told you–that the power over their legs passes from
the one to the other regularly every week?“</p>
<p>“Regularly? Bless your heart, regularly ain’t any name for the
exactness of it! All the big cities in Europe used to set the clocks by
it.“ (Laughter, suppressed by the court.)</p>
<p>“How do you know? That is the question. Please answer it plainly and
squarely.“</p>
<p>“Don’t you talk to me like that, Sim Robinson–I won’t have it. How do
I know, indeed! How do you know what you know? Because somebody told
you. You didn’t invent it out of your own head, did you? Why, these
twins are the truthfulest people in the world; and I don’t think it
becomes you to sit up there and throw slurs at them when they haven’t
been doing anything to you. And they are orphans besides–both of them.
All–“</p>
<p>But Aunt Betsy was up again now, and both old ladies were talking at
once and with all their might; but as the house was weltering in a storm
of laughter, and the judge was hammering his desk with an iron
paper-weight, one could only see them talk, not hear them. At last, when
quiet was restored, the court said:</p>
<p>“Let the ladies retire.“</p>
<p>“But, your honor, I have the right, in the interest of my clients,–to
cross-exam–“</p>
<p>“You’ll not need to exercise it, Mr. Wilson–the evidence is thrown
out.“</p>
<p>“Thrown out!“ said Aunt Patsy, ruffled; “and what’s it thrown out
for, I’d like to know.“</p>
<p>“And so would I, Patsy Cooper. It seems to me that if we can save
these poor persecuted strangers, it is our bounden duty to stand up here
and talk for them till–“</p>
<p>“There, there, there, do sit down!“</p>
<p>It cost some trouble and a good deal of coaxing, but they were got
into their seats at last. The trial was soon ended now. The twins
themselves became witnesses in their own defense. They established the
fact, upon oath, that the leg-power passed from one to the other every
Saturday night at twelve o’clock sharp. But or cross-examination their
counsel would not allow them to tell whose week of power the current
week was. The judge insisted upon their answering, and proposed to
compel them, but even the prosecution took fright and came to the rescue
then, and helped stay the sturdy jurist’s revolutionary hand. So the
case had to go to the jury with that important point hanging in the air.
They were out an hour and brought in this verdict:</p>
<p>“We the jury do find: 1, that an assault was committed, as charged;
2, that it was committed by one of the persons accused, he having been
seen to do it by several credible witnesses; 3, but that his identity is
so merged in his brother’s that we have not been able to tell which was
him. We cannot convict both, for only one is guilty. We cannot acquit
both, for only one is innocent. Our verdict is that justice has been
defeated by the dispensation of God, and ask to be discharged from
further duty.“</p>
<p>This was read aloud in court and brought out a burst of hearty
applause. The old ladies made a spring at the twins, to shake and
congratulate, but were gently disengaged by Mr. Wilson and softly
crowded back into their places.</p>
<p>The judge rose in his little tribune, laid aside his silver-bowed
spectacles, roached his gray hair up with his fingers, and said, with
dignity and solemnity, and even with a certain pathos:</p>
<p>“In all my experience on the bench, I have not seen justice bow her
head in shame in this court until this day. You little realize what
far-reaching harm has just been wrought here under the fickle forms of
law. Imitation is the bane of courts–I thank God that this one is free
from the contamination of that vice–and in no long time you will see the
fatal work of this hour seized upon by profligate so-called guardians of
justice in all the wide circumstance of this planet and perpetuated in
their pernicious decisions. I wash my hands of this iniquity. I would
have compelled these culprits to expose their guilt, but support failed
me where I had most right to expect aid and encouragement. And I was
confronted by a law made in the interest of crime, which protects the
criminal from testifying against himself. Yet I had precedents of my own
whereby I had set aside that law on two different occasions and thus
succeeded in convicting criminals to whose crimes there were no
witnesses but themselves. What have you accomplished this day? Do you
realize it? You have set adrift, unadmonished, in this community, two
men endowed with an awful and mysterious gift, a hidden and grisly power
for evil –a power by which each in his turn may commit crime after crime
of the most heinous character, and no man be able to tell which is the
guilty or which the innocent party in any case of them all. Look to your
homes look to your property look to your lives for you have need!</p>
<p>“Prisoners at the bar, stand up. Through suppression of evidence, a
jury of your–our–countrymen have been obliged to deliver a verdict
concerning your case which stinks to heaven with the rankness of its
injustice. By its terms you, the guilty one, go free with the innocent.
Depart in peace, and come no more! The costs devolve upon the outraged
plaintiff–another iniquity. The court stands dissolved.“</p>
<p>Almost everybody crowded forward to overwhelm the twins and their
counsel with congratulations; but presently the two old aunties dug the
duplicates out and bore them away in triumph through the hurrahing
crowd, while lots of new friends carried Pudd’nhead Wilson off
tavernward to feast him and “wet down“ his great and victorious entry
into the legal arena. To Wilson, so long familiar with neglect and
depreciation, this strange new incense of popularity and admiration was
as a fragrance blown from the fields of paradise. A happy man was
Wilson.</p>
