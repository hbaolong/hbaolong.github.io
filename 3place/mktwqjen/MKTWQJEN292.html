<h4 id="paris-notes">PARIS NOTES</h4>
<p>–[Crowded out of “A Tramp Abroad“ to make room for more vital
statistics.–M. T.]</p>
<p>The Parisian travels but little, he knows no language but his own,
reads no literature but his own, and consequently he is pretty narrow
and pretty self-sufficient. However, let us not be too sweeping; there
are Frenchmen who know languages not their own: these are the waiters.
Among the rest, they know English; that is, they know it on the European
plan –which is to say, they can speak it, but can’t understand it. They
easily make themselves understood, but it is next to impossible to word
an English sentence in such away as to enable them to comprehend it.
They think they comprehend it; they pretend they do; but they don’t.
Here is a conversation which I had with one of these beings; I wrote it
down at the time, in order to have it exactly correct.</p>
<p>I. These are fine oranges. Where are they grown?</p>
<p>He. More? Yes, I will bring them.</p>
<p>I. No, do not bring any more; I only want to know where they are from
where they are raised.</p>
<p>He. Yes? (with imperturbable mien and rising inflection.)</p>
<p>I. Yes. Can you tell me what country they are from?</p>
<p>He. Yes? (blandly, with rising inflection.)</p>
<p>I. (disheartened). They are very nice.</p>
<p>He. Good night. (Bows, and retires, quite satisfied with
himself.)</p>
<p>That young man could have become a good English scholar by taking the
right sort of pains, but he was French, and wouldn’t do that. How
different is the case with our people; they utilize every means that
offers. There are some alleged French Protestants in Paris, and they
built a nice little church on one of the great avenues that lead away
from the Arch of Triumph, and proposed to listen to the correct thing,
preached in the correct way, there, in their precious French tongue, and
be happy. But their little game does not succeed. Our people are always
there ahead of them Sundays, and take up all the room. When the minister
gets up to preach, he finds his house full of devout foreigners, each
ready and waiting, with his little book in his hand–a morocco-bound
Testament, apparently. But only apparently; it is Mr. Bellows’s
admirable and exhaustive little French-English dictionary, which in look
and binding and size is just like a Testament and those people are there
to study French. The building has been nicknamed “The Church of the
Gratis French Lesson.“</p>
<p>These students probably acquire more language than general
information, for I am told that a French sermon is like a French
speech–it never names a historical event, but only the date of it; if
you are not up in dates, you get left. A French speech is something like
this:</p>
<p>Comrades, citizens, brothers, noble parts of the only sublime and
perfect nation, let us not forget that the 21st January cast off our
chains; that the 10th August relieved us of the shameful presence of
foreign spies; that the 5th September was its own justification before
heaven and humanity; that the 18th Brumaire contained the seeds of its
own punishment; that the 14th July was the mighty voice of liberty
proclaiming the resurrection, the new day, and inviting the oppressed
peoples of the earth to look upon the divine face of France and live;
and let us here record our everlasting curse against the man of the 2d
December, and declare in thunder tones, the native tones of France, that
but for him there had been no 17th March in history, no 12th October, no
19th January, no 22d April, no 16th November, no 30th September, no 2d
July, no 14th February, no 29th June, no 15th August, no 31st May–that
but for him, France the pure, the grand, the peerless, had had a serene
and vacant almanac today!</p>
<p>I have heard of one French sermon which closed in this odd yet
eloquent way:</p>
<p>My hearers, we have sad cause to remember the man of the 13th
January. The results of the vast crime of the 13th January have been in
just proportion to the magnitude of the set itself. But for it there had
been no 30 November–sorrowful spectacle! The grisly deed of the 16th
June had not been done but for it, nor had the man of the 16th June
known existence; to it alone the 3d September was due, also the fatal
12th October. Shall we, then, be grateful for the 13th January, with its
freight of death for you and me and all that breathe? Yes, my friends,
for it gave us also that which had never come but for it, and it
atone–the blessed 25th December.</p>
<p>It may be well enough to explain, though in the case of many of my
readers this will hardly be necessary. The man of the 13th January is
Adam; the crime of that date was the eating of the apple; the sorrowful
spectacle of the 30th November was the expulsion from Eden; the grisly
deed of the 16th June was the murder of Abel; the act of the 3d
September was the beginning of the journey to the land of Nod; the 12th
day of October, the last mountain-tops disappeared under the flood. When
you go to church in France, you want to take your almanac with
you–annotated.</p>
