OF 1900, MAINLY TO TWICHELL. THE BOER WAR. BOXER TROUBLES. THE RETURN TO
AMERICA</h4>
<p>The New Year found Clemens still in London, chiefly interested in
osteopathy and characteristically glorifying the practice at the expense
of other healing methods.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>LONDON, Jan. 8, 1900. DEAR JOE,–Mental Telepathy has scored another.
Mental Telegraphy will be greatly respected a century hence.</p>
<p>By the accident of writing my sister and describing to her the
remarkable cures made by Kellgren with his hands and without drugs, I
brought upon myself a quite stunning surprise; for she wrote to me that
she had been taking this very treatment in Buffalo–and that it was an
American invention.</p>
<p>Well, it does really turn out that Dr. Still, in the middle of
Kansas, in a village, began to experiment in 1874, only five years after
Kellgren began the same work obscurely in the village of Gotha, in
Germany. Dr. Still seems to be an honest man; therefore I am persuaded
that Kellgren moved him to his experiments by Mental Telegraphy across
six hours of longitude, without need of a wire. By the time Still began
to experiment, Kellgren had completed his development of the principles
of his system and established himself in a good practice in London–1874
–and was in good shape to convey his discovery to Kansas, Mental
Telegraphically.</p>
<p>Yes, I was greatly surprised to find that my mare’s nest was much in
arrears: that this new science was well known in America under the name
of Osteopathy. Since then, I find that in the past 3 years it has got
itself legalized in 14 States in spite of the opposition of the
physicians; that it has established 20 Osteopathic schools and colleges;
that among its students are 75 allopathic physicians; that there is a
school in Boston and another in Philadelphia, that there are about 100
students in the parent college (Dr. Still’s at Kirksville, Missouri,)
and that there are about 2,000 graduates practicing in America. Dear me,
there are not 30 in Europe. Europe is so sunk in superstitions and
prejudices that it is an almost impossible thing to get her to do
anything but scoff at a new thing–unless it come from abroad; as witness
the telegraph, dentistry, andandandandc.</p>
<p>Presently the Osteopath will come over here from America and will
soon make himself a power that must be recognized and reckoned with; and
then, 25 years from now, England will begin to claim the invention and
tell all about its origin, in the Cyclopedia B—–as in the case of the
telegraph, applied anaesthetics and the other benefactions which she
heaped her abuse upon when her inventors first offered them to her.</p>
<p>I cannot help feeling rather inordinately proud of America for the
gay and hearty way in which she takes hold of any new thing that comes
along and gives it a first rate trial. Many an ass in America, is
getting a deal of benefit out of X-Science’s new exploitation of an
age-old healing principle–faith, combined with the patient’s
imagination–let it boom along! I have no objection. Let them call it by
what name they choose, so long as it does helpful work among the class
which is numerically vastly the largest bulk of the human race, i.e. the
fools, the idiots, the pudd’nheads.</p>
<p>We do not guess, we know that 9 in 10 of the species are pudd’nheads.
We know it by various evidences; and one of them is, that for ages the
race has respected (and almost venerated) the physician’s grotesque
system–the emptying of miscellaneous and harmful drugs into a person’s
stomach to remove ailments which in many cases the drugs could not reach
at all; in many cases could reach and help, but only at cost of damage
to some other part of the man; and in the remainder of the cases the
drug either retarded the cure, or the disease was cured by nature in
spite of the nostrums. The doctor’s insane system has not only been
permitted to continue its follies for ages, but has been protected by
the State and made a close monopoly–an infamous thing, a crime against a
free-man’s proper right to choose his own assassin or his own method of
defending his body against disease and death.</p>
<p>And yet at the same time, with curious and senile inconsistency, the
State has allowed the man to choose his own assassin–in one detail–the
patent-medicine detail–making itself the protector of that perilous
business, collecting money out of it, and appointing no committee of
experts to examine the medicines and forbid them when extra dangerous.
Really, when a man can prove that he is not a jackass, I think he is in
the way to prove that he is no legitimate member of the race.</p>
<p>I have by me a list of 52 human ailments–common ones–and in this list
I count 19 which the physician’s art cannot cure. But there isn’t one
which Osteopathy or Kellgren cannot cure, if the patient comes
early.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago I had a deep reverence for the physician and the
surgeon. But 6 months of closely watching the Kellgren business has
revolutionized all that, and now I have neither reverence nor respect
for the physician’s trade, and scarcely any for the surgeon’s,–I am
convinced that of all quackeries, the physician’s is the grotesquest and
the silliest. And they know they are shams and humbugs. They have taken
the place of those augurs who couldn’t look each other in the face
without laughing.</p>
<p>See what a powerful hold our ancient superstitions have upon us: two
weeks ago, when Livy committed an incredible imprudence and by
consequence was promptly stricken down with a heavy triple attack
–influenza, bronchitis, and a lung affected–she recognized the gravity
of the situation, and her old superstitions rose: she thought she ought
to send for a doctor–Think of it–the last man in the world I should want
around at such a time. Of course I did not say no–not that I was
indisposed to take the responsibility, for I was not, my notion of a
dangerous responsibility being quite the other way–but because it is
unsafe to distress a sick person; I only said we knew no good doctor,
and it could not be good policy to choose at hazard; so she allowed me
to send for Kellgren. To-day she is up and around–cured. It is safe to
say that persons hit in the same way at the same time are in bed yet,
and booked to stay there a good while, and to be in a shackly condition
and afraid of their shadows for a couple of years or more to come.</p>
<p>It will be seen by the foregoing that Mark Twain’s interest in the
Kellgren system was still an ardent one. Indeed, for a time he gave most
of his thought to it, and wrote several long appreciations, perhaps with
little idea of publication, but merely to get his enthusiasm physically
expressed. War, however, presently supplanted medicine–the Boer troubles
in South Africa and the Boxer insurrection in China. It was a
disturbing, exciting year.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>WELLINGTON COURT, KNIGHTSBRIDGE, Jan. 25, 1900. DEAR HOWELLS,–If you
got half as much as Pond prophesied, be content and praise God–it has
not happened to another. But I am sorry he didn’t go with you; for it is
marvelous to hear him yarn. He is good company, cheery and hearty, and
his mill is never idle. Your doing a lecture tour was heroic. It was the
highest order of grit, and you have a right to be proud of yourself. No
mount of applause or money or both could save it from being a hell to a
man constituted as you are. It is that even to me, who am made of
coarser stuff.</p>
<p>I knew the audiences would come forward and shake hands with you–that
one infallible sign of sincere approval. In all my life, wherever it
failed me I left the hall sick and ashamed, knowing what it meant.</p>
<p>Privately speaking, this is a sordid and criminal war, and in every
way shameful and excuseless. Every day I write (in my head) bitter
magazine articles about it, but I have to stop with that. For England
must not fall; it would mean an inundation of Russian and German
political degradations which would envelop the globe and steep it in a
sort of Middle-Age night and slavery which would last till Christ comes
again. Even wrong–and she is wrong–England must be upheld. He is an
enemy of the human race who shall speak against her now. Why was the
human race created? Or at least why wasn’t something creditable created
in place of it. God had his opportunity. He could have made a
reputation. But no, He must commit this grotesque folly–a lark which
must have cost him a regret or two when He came to think it over and
observe effects. For a giddy and unbecoming caprice there has been
nothing like it till this war. I talk the war with both sides–always
waiting until the other man introduces the topic. Then I say “My head is
with the Briton, but my heart and such rags of morals as I have are with
the Boer–now we will talk, unembarrassed and without prejudice.“ And so
we discuss, and have no trouble.</p>
<p>Jan. 26. It was my intention to make some disparaging remarks about
the human race; and so I kept this letter open for that purpose, and for
the purpose of telling my dream, wherein the Trinity were trying to
guess a conundrum, but I can do better–for I can snip out of the “Times“
various samples and side-lights which bring the race down to date, and
expose it as of yesterday. If you will notice, there is seldom a
telegram in a paper which fails to show up one or more members and
beneficiaries of our Civilization as promenading in his shirt-tail, with
the rest of his regalia in the wash.</p>
<p>I love to see the holy ones air their smug pieties and admire them
and smirk over them, and at the same moment frankly and publicly show
their contempt for the pieties of the Boer–confidently expecting the
approval of the country and the pulpit, and getting it.</p>
<p>I notice that God is on both sides in this war; thus history repeats
itself. But I am the only person who has noticed this; everybody here
thinks He is playing the game for this side, and for this side only.</p>
<p>With great love to you all MARK.</p>
<p>One cannot help wondering what Mark Twain would have thought of human
nature had he lived to see the great World War, fought mainly by the
Christian nations who for nearly two thousand years had been preaching
peace on earth and goodwill toward men. But his opinion of the race
could hardly have been worse than it was. And nothing that human beings
could do would have surprised him.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>LONDON, Jan. 27, 1900. DEAR JOE,–Apparently we are not proposing to
set the Filipinos free and give their islands to them; and apparently we
are not proposing to hang the priests and confiscate their property. If
these things are so, the war out there has no interest for me.</p>
<p>I have just been examining chapter LXX of “Following the Equator,“ to
see if the Boer’s old military effectiveness is holding out. It reads
curiously as if it had been written about the present war.</p>
<p>I believe that in the next chapter my notion of the Boer was rightly
conceived. He is popularly called uncivilized, I do not know why.
Happiness, food, shelter, clothing, wholesale labor, modest and rational
ambitions, honesty, kindliness, hospitality, love of freedom and
limitless courage to fight for it, composure and fortitude in time of
disaster, patience in time of hardship and privation, absence of noise
and brag in time of victory, contentment with a humble and peaceful life
void of insane excitements–if there is a higher and better form of
civilization than this, I am not aware of it and do not know where to
look for it. I suppose we have the habit of imagining that a lot of
artistic, intellectual and other artificialities must be added, or it
isn’t complete. We and the English have these latter; but as we lack the
great bulk of these others, I think the Boer civilization is the best of
the two. My idea of our civilization is that it is a shabby poor thing
and full of cruelties, vanities, arrogancies, meannesses, and
hypocrisies. As for the word, I hate the sound of it, for it conveys a
lie; and as for the thing itself, I wish it was in hell, where it
belongs.</p>
<p>Provided we could get something better in the place of it. But that
is not possible, perhaps. Poor as it is, it is better than real
savagery, therefore we must stand by it, extend it, and (in public)
praise it. And so we must not utter any hateful word about England in
these days, nor fail to hope that she will win in this war, for her
defeat and fall would be an irremediable disaster for the mangy human
race…. Naturally, then, I am for England; but she is profoundly in the
wrong, Joe, and no (instructed) Englishman doubts it. At least that is
my belief.</p>
<p>Maybe I managed to make myself misunderstood, as to the
Osteopathists. I wanted to know how the men impress you. As to their
Art, I know fairly well about that, and should not value Hartford’s
opinion of it; nor a physician’s; nor that of another who proposed to
enlighten me out of his ignorance. Opinions based upon theory,
superstition and ignorance are not very precious.</p>
<p>Livy and the others are off for the country for a day or two. Love to
you all MARK.</p>
<p>The next letter affords a pleasant variation. Without doubt it was
written on realizing that good nature and enthusiasm had led him into
indiscretion. This was always happening to him, and letters like this
are not infrequent, though generally less entertaining.</p>
<p>To Mr. Ann, in London:</p>
<p>WELLINGTON COURT, Feb. 23, ’00. DEAR MR. ANN,–Upon sober second
thought, it won’t do!–I withdraw that letter. Not because I said
anything in it which is not true, for I didn’t; but because when I allow
my name to be used in forwarding a stock-scheme I am assuming a certain
degree of responsibility as toward the investor, and I am not willing to
do that. I have another objection, a purely selfish one: trading upon my
name, whether the enterprise scored a success or a failure would damage
me. I can’t afford that; even the Archbishop of Canterbury couldn’t
afford it, and he has more character to spare than I have. (Ah, a happy
thought! If he would sign the letter with me that would change the whole
complexion of the thing, of course. I do not know him, yet I would sign
any commercial scheme that he would sign. As he does not know me, it
follows that he would sign anything that I would sign. This is
unassailable logic–but really that is all that can be said for it.)</p>
<p>No, I withdraw the letter. This virgin is pure up to date, and is
going to remain so. Ys sincerely, S. L. C.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>WELLINGTON COURT, KNIGHTSBRIDGE, Mch. 4, ’00. DEAR JOE,–Henry
Robinson’s death is a sharp wound to me, and it goes very deep. I had a
strong affection for him, and I think he had for me. Every Friday,
three-fourths of the year for 16 years he was of the billiard-party in
our house. When we come home, how shall we have billiard-nights
again–with no Ned Bunce and no Henry Robinson? I believe I could not
endure that. We must find another use for that room. Susy is gone,
George is gone, Libby Hamersley, Ned Bunce, Henry Robinson. The friends
are passing, one by one; our house, where such warm blood and such dear
blood flowed so freely, is become a cemetery. But not in any repellent
sense. Our dead are welcome there; their life made it beautiful, their
death has hallowed it, we shall have them with us always, and there will
be no parting.</p>
<p>It was a moving address you made over Ward Cheney–that fortunate,
youth! Like Susy, he got out of life all that was worth the living, and
got his great reward before he had crossed the tropic frontier of dreams
and entered the Sahara of fact. The deep consciousness of Susy’s good
fortune is a constant comfort to me.</p>
<p>London is happy-hearted at last. The British victories have swept the
clouds away and there are no uncheerful faces. For three months the
private dinner parties (we go to no public ones) have been Lodges of
Sorrow, and just a little depressing sometimes; but now they are smiley
and animated again. Joe, do you know the Irish gentleman and the Irish
lady, the Scotch gentleman and the Scotch lady? These are darlings,
every one. Night before last it was all Irish–24. One would have to
travel far to match their ease and sociability and animation and sparkle
and absence of shyness and self-consciousness.</p>
<p>It was American in these fine qualities. This was at Mr. Lecky’s. He
is Irish, you know. Last night it was Irish again, at Lady Gregory’s.
Lord Roberts is Irish; and Sir William Butler; and Kitchener, I think;
and a disproportion of the other prominent Generals are of Irish and
Scotch breed-keeping up the traditions of Wellington, and Sir Colin
Campbell of the Mutiny. You will have noticed that in S. A. as in the
Mutiny, it is usually the Irish and the Scotch that are placed in the
fore-front of the battle. An Irish friend of mine says this is because
the Kelts are idealists, and enthusiasts, with age-old heroisms to
emulate and keep bright before the world; but that the low-class
Englishman is dull and without ideals, fighting bull-doggishly while he
has a leader, but losing his head and going to pieces when his leader
falls–not so with the Kelt. Sir Wm. Butler said “the Kelt is the
spear-head of the British lance.“ Love to you all. MARK.</p>
<p>The Henry Robinson mentioned in the foregoing letter was Henry C.
Robinson, one-time Governor of Connecticut, long a dear and intimate
friend of the Clemens household. “Lecky“ was W. E. H. Lecky, the Irish
historian whose History of European Morals had been, for many years, one
of Mark Twain’s favorite books:</p>
<p>In July the Clemenses left the small apartment at 30 Wellington Court
and established a summer household a little way out of London, at Dollis
Hill. To-day the place has been given to the public under the name of
Gladstone Park, so called for the reason that in an earlier time
Gladstone had frequently visited there. It was a beautiful spot, a place
of green grass and spreading oaks. In a letter in which Mrs. Clemens
wrote to her sister she said: “It is simply divinely beautiful and
peaceful; the great, old trees are beyond everything. I believe nowhere
in the world do you find such trees as in England.“ Clemens wrote to
Twichell: “From the house you can see little but spacious stretches of
hay-fields and green turf….. Yet the massed, brick blocks of London are
reachable in three minutes on a horse. By rail we can be in the heart of
London, in Baker Street, in seventeen minutes–by a smart train in
five.“</p>
<p>Mail, however, would seem to have been less prompt.</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Times, in London:</p>
<p>SIR,–It has often been claimed that the London postal service was
swifter than that of New York, and I have always believed that the claim
was justified. But a doubt has lately sprung up in my mind. I live eight
miles from Printing House Square; the Times leaves that point at 4
o’clock in the morning, by mail, and reaches me at 5 in the afternoon,
thus making the trip in thirteen hours.</p>
<p>It is my conviction that in New York we should do it in eleven.</p>
<p>C. DOLLIS HILL, N. W.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>DOLLIS HILL HOUSE, KILBURN, N. W. LONDON, Aug. 12, ’00. DEAR JOE,–The
Sages Prof. Fiske and Brander Matthews were out here to tea a week ago
and it was a breath of American air to see them. We furnished them a
bright day and comfortable weather–and they used it all up, in their
extravagant American way. Since then we have sat by coal fires,
evenings.</p>
<p>We shall sail for home sometime in October, but shall winter in New
York where we can have an osteopath of good repute to continue the work
of putting this family in proper condition.</p>
<p>Livy and I dined with the Chief Justice a month ago and he was as
well-conditioned as an athlete.</p>
<p>It is all China, now, and my sympathies are with the Chinese. They
have been villainously dealt with by the sceptred thieves of Europe, and
I hope they will drive all the foreigners out and keep them out for
good. I only wish it; of course I don’t really expect it.</p>
<p>Why, hang it, it occurs to me that by the time we reach New York you
Twichells will be invading Europe and once more we shall miss the
connection. This is thoroughly exasperating. Aren’t we ever going to
meet again? With no end of love from all of us, MARK.</p>
<p>P. S. Aug. 18. DEAR JOE,–It is 7.30 a. m. I have been waking very
early, lately. If it occurs once more, it will be habit; then I will
submit and adopt it.</p>
<p>This is our day of mourning. It is four years since Susy died; it is
five years and a month that I saw her alive for the last time-throwing
kisses at us from the railway platform when we started West around the
world.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is a century; sometimes it was yesterday. With love
MARK.</p>
<p>We discover in the foregoing letter that the long European residence
was drawing to an end. More than nine years had passed since the closing
of the Hartford house–eventful years that had seen failure, bereavement,
battle with debt, and rehabilitated fortunes. All the family were
anxious to get home–Mark Twain most anxious of all.</p>
<p>They closed Dollis Hill House near the end of September, and put up
for a brief period at a family hotel, an amusing picture of which
follows.</p>
<p>To J. Y. M. MacAlister, in London:</p>
<p>Sep. 1900. MY DEAR MACALISTER,–We do really start next Saturday. I
meant to sail earlier, but waited to finish some studies of what are
called Family Hotels. They are a London specialty, God has not permitted
them to exist elsewhere; they are ramshackle clubs which were dwellings
at the time of the Heptarchy. Dover and Albemarle Streets are filled
with them. The once spacious rooms are split up into coops which afford
as much discomfort as can be had anywhere out of jail for any money. All
the modern inconveniences are furnished, and some that have been
obsolete for a century. The prices are astonishingly high for what you
get. The bedrooms are hospitals for incurable furniture. I find it so in
this one. They exist upon a tradition; they represent the vanishing
home-like inn of fifty years ago, and are mistaken by foreigners for it.
Some quite respectable Englishmen still frequent them through inherited
habit and arrested development; many Americans also, through ignorance
and superstition. The rooms are as interesting as the Tower of London,
but older I think. Older and dearer. The lift was a gift of William the
Conqueror, some of the beds are prehistoric. They represent geological
periods. Mine is the oldest. It is formed in strata of Old Red
Sandstone, volcanic tufa, ignis fatuus, and bicarbonate of hornblende,
superimposed upon argillaceous shale, and contains the prints of
prehistoric man. It is in No. 149. Thousands of scientists come to see
it. They consider it holy. They want to blast out the prints but cannot.
Dynamite rebounds from it.</p>
<p>Finished studies and sail Saturday in Minnehaha. Yours ever
affectionately, MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>They sailed for New York October 6th, and something more than a week
later America gave them a royal welcome. The press, far and wide,
sounded Mark Twain’s praises once more; dinners and receptions were
offered on every hand; editors and lecture agents clamored for him.</p>
<p>The family settled in the Earlington Hotel during a period of
house-hunting. They hoped eventually to return to Hartford, but after a
brief visit paid by Clemens alone to the old place he wrote:</p>
<p>To Sylvester Baxter, in Boston:</p>
<p>NEW YORK, Oct. 26, 1900. DEAR MR. BAXTER,–It was a great pleasure to
me to renew the other days with you, and there was a pathetic pleasure
in seeing Hartford and the house again; but I realize that if we ever
enter the house again to live, our hearts will break. I am not sure that
we shall ever be strong enough to endure that strain. Sincerely yours,
S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Rogers wished to have them in their neighborhood, but
the houses there were not suitable, or were too expensive. Through
Mr. Frank Doubleday they eventually found, at 14 West Tenth Street, a
large residence handsomely furnished, and this they engaged for the
winter. “We were lucky to get this big house furnished,“ he wrote
MacAlister in London. “There was not another one in town procurable that
would answer us, but this one is all right–space enough in it for
several families, the rooms all old-fashioned, great size.“</p>
<p>The little note that follows shows that Mark Twain had not entirely
forgotten the days of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.</p>
<p>To a Neighbor on West Tenth Street, New York:</p>
<p>Nov. 30. DEAR MADAM,–I know I ought to respect my duty and perform
it, but I am weak and faithless where boys are concerned, and I can’t
help secretly approving pretty bad and noisy ones, though I do object to
the kind that ring door-bells. My family try to get me to stop the boys
from holding conventions on the front steps, but I basely shirk out of
it, because I think the boys enjoy it.</p>
<p>My wife has been complaining to me this evening about the boys on the
front steps and under compulsion I have made some promises. But I am
very forgetful, now that I am old, and my sense of duty is getting
spongy. Very truly yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
