<h4 id="chapter-38-the-house-beautiful">Chapter 38 The House
Beautiful</h4>
<p>WE took passage in a Cincinnati boat for New Orleans; or on a
Cincinnati boat–either is correct; the former is the eastern form of
putting it, the latter the western.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickens declined to agree that the Mississippi steamboats were
‘magnificent,’ or that they were ‘floating palaces,’–terms which had
always been applied to them; terms which did not over-express the
admiration with which the people viewed them.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickens’s position was unassailable, possibly; the people’s
position was certainly unassailable. If Mr. Dickens was comparing these
boats with the crown jewels; or with the Taj, or with the Matterhorn; or
with some other priceless or wonderful thing which he had seen, they
were not magnificent–he was right. The people compared them with what
they had seen; and, thus measured, thus judged, the boats were
magnificent–the term was the correct one, it was not at all too strong.
The people were as right as was Mr. Dickens. The steamboats were finer
than anything on shore. Compared with superior dwelling-houses and
first-class hotels in the Valley, they were indubitably magnificent,
they were ‘palaces.’ To a few people living in New Orleans and
St. Louis, they were not magnificent, perhaps; not palaces; but to the
great majority of those populations, and to the entire populations
spread over both banks between Baton Rouge and St. Louis, they were
palaces; they tallied with the citizen’s dream of what magnificence was,
and satisfied it.</p>
<p>Every town and village along that vast stretch of double
river-frontage had a best dwelling, finest dwelling, mansion,–the home
of its wealthiest and most conspicuous citizen. It is easy to describe
it: large grassy yard, with paling fence painted white–in fair repair;
brick walk from gate to door; big, square, two-story ‘frame’ house,
painted white and porticoed like a Grecian temple–with this difference,
that the imposing fluted columns and Corinthian capitals were a pathetic
sham, being made of white pine, and painted; iron knocker; brass door
knob–discolored, for lack of polishing. Within, an uncarpeted hall, of
planed boards; opening out of it, a parlor, fifteen feet by fifteen–in
some instances five or ten feet larger; ingrain carpet; mahogany center-
table; lamp on it, with green-paper shade–standing on a gridiron, so to
speak, made of high-colored yarns, by the young ladies of the house, and
called a lamp-mat; several books, piled and disposed, with cast-iron
exactness, according to an inherited and unchangeable plan; among them,
Tupper, much penciled; also, ‘Friendship’s Offering,’ and ‘Affection’s
Wreath,’ with their sappy inanities illustrated in die-away mezzotints;
also, Ossian; ‘Alonzo and Melissa:’ maybe ‘Ivanhoe:’ also ‘Album,’ full
of original ‘poetry’ of the Thou-hast-wounded-the-spirit-that-loved-thee
breed; two or three goody-goody works–‘Shepherd of Salisbury Plain,’
etc.; current number of the chaste and innocuous Godey’s ‘Lady’s Book,’
with painted fashion-plate of wax-figure women with mouths all alike–
lips and eyelids the same size–each five-foot woman with a two-inch
wedge sticking from under her dress and letting-on to be half of her
foot. Polished air-tight stove (new and deadly invention), with pipe
passing through a board which closes up the discarded good old
fireplace. On each end of the wooden mantel, over the fireplace, a large
basket of peaches and other fruits, natural size, all done in plaster,
rudely, or in wax, and painted to resemble the originals–which they
don’t. Over middle of mantel, engraving–Washington Crossing the
Delaware; on the wall by the door, copy of it done in thunder-and-
lightning crewels by one of the young ladies–work of art which would
have made Washington hesitate about crossing, if he could have foreseen
what advantage was going to be taken of it. Piano–kettle in disguise–
with music, bound and unbound, piled on it, and on a stand near by:
Battle of Prague; Bird Waltz; Arkansas Traveler; Rosin the Bow;
Marseilles Hymn; On a Lone Barren Isle (St. Helena); The Last Link is
Broken; She wore a Wreath of Roses the Night when last we met; Go,
forget me, Why should Sorrow o’er that Brow a Shadow fling; Hours there
were to Memory Dearer; Long, Long Ago; Days of Absence; A Life on the
Ocean Wave, a Home on the Rolling Deep; Bird at Sea; and spread open on
the rack, where the plaintive singer has left it, RO-holl on, silver
MOO-hoon, guide the TRAV-el-lerr his WAY, etc. Tilted pensively against
the piano, a guitar–guitar capable of playing the Spanish Fandango by
itself, if you give it a start. Frantic work of art on the wall–pious
motto, done on the premises, sometimes in colored yarns, sometimes in
faded grasses: progenitor of the ‘God Bless Our Home’ of modern
commerce. Framed in black moldings on the wall, other works of arts,
conceived and committed on the premises, by the young ladies; being grim
black-and-white crayons; landscapes, mostly: lake, solitary sail-boat,
petrified clouds, pre-geological trees on shore, anthracite precipice;
name of criminal conspicuous in the corner. Lithograph, Napoleon
Crossing the Alps. Lithograph, The Grave at St. Helena. Steel-plates,
Trumbull’s Battle of Bunker Hill, and the Sally from Gibraltar. Copper-
plates, Moses Smiting the Rock, and Return of the Prodigal Son. In big
gilt frame, slander of the family in oil: papa holding a book
(‘Constitution of the United States’); guitar leaning against mamma,
blue ribbons fluttering from its neck; the young ladies, as children, in
slippers and scalloped pantelettes, one embracing toy horse, the other
beguiling kitten with ball of yarn, and both simpering up at mamma, who
simpers back. These persons all fresh, raw, and red–apparently skinned.
Opposite, in gilt frame, grandpa and grandma, at thirty and twenty-two,
stiff, old-fashioned, high-collared, puff-sleeved, glaring pallidly out
from a background of solid Egyptian night. Under a glass French clock
dome, large bouquet of stiff flowers done in corpsy-white wax. Pyramidal
what-not in the corner, the shelves occupied chiefly with bric-a-brac of
the period, disposed with an eye to best effect: shell, with the Lord’s
Prayer carved on it; another shell–of the long-oval sort, narrow,
straight orifice, three inches long, running from end to end–portrait of
Washington carved on it; not well done; the shell had Washington’s
mouth, originally–artist should have built to that. These two are
memorials of the long-ago bridal trip to New Orleans and the French
Market. Other bric-a-brac: Californian ‘specimens’–quartz, with gold
wart adhering; old Guinea-gold locket, with circlet of ancestral hair in
it; Indian arrow-heads, of flint; pair of bead moccasins, from uncle who
crossed the Plains; three ‘alum’ baskets of various colors– being
skeleton-frame of wire, clothed-on with cubes of crystallized alum in
the rock-candy style–works of art which were achieved by the young
ladies; their doubles and duplicates to be found upon all what-nots in
the land; convention of desiccated bugs and butterflies pinned to a
card; painted toy-dog, seated upon bellows-attachment–drops its under
jaw and squeaks when pressed upon; sugar-candy rabbit–limbs and features
merged together, not strongly defined; pewter presidential- campaign
medal; miniature card-board wood-sawyer, to be attached to the
stove-pipe and operated by the heat; small Napoleon, done in wax;
spread-open daguerreotypes of dim children, parents, cousins, aunts, and
friends, in all attitudes but customary ones; no templed portico at
back, and manufactured landscape stretching away in the distance–that
came in later, with the photograph; all these vague figures lavishly
chained and ringed–metal indicated and secured from doubt by stripes and
splashes of vivid gold bronze; all of them too much combed, too much
fixed up; and all of them uncomfortable in inflexible Sunday-clothes of
a pattern which the spectator cannot realize could ever have been in
fashion; husband and wife generally grouped together–husband sitting,
wife standing, with hand on his shoulder–and both preserving, all these
fading years, some traceable effect of the daguerreotypist’s brisk ‘Now
smile, if you please!’ Bracketed over what-not–place of special
sacredness–an outrage in water-color, done by the young niece that came
on a visit long ago, and died. Pity, too; for she might have repented of
this in time. Horse-hair chairs, horse-hair sofa which keeps sliding
from under you. Window shades, of oil stuff, with milk-maids and ruined
castles stenciled on them in fierce colors. Lambrequins dependent from
gaudy boxings of beaten tin, gilded. Bedrooms with rag carpets;
bedsteads of the ‘corded’ sort, with a sag in the middle, the cords
needing tightening; snuffy feather-bed–not aired often enough; cane-
seat chairs, splint-bottomed rocker; looking-glass on wall, school-slate
size, veneered frame; inherited bureau; wash-bowl and pitcher, possibly
–but not certainly; brass candlestick, tallow candle, snuffers. Nothing
else in the room. Not a bathroom in the house; and no visitor likely to
come along who has ever seen one.</p>
<p>That was the residence of the principal citizen, all the way from the
suburbs of New Orleans to the edge of St. Louis. When he stepped aboard
a big fine steamboat, he entered a new and marvelous world: chimney-tops
cut to counterfeit a spraying crown of plumes–and maybe painted red;
pilot-house, hurricane deck, boiler-deck guards, all garnished with
white wooden filigree work of fanciful patterns; gilt acorns topping the
derricks; gilt deer-horns over the big bell; gaudy symbolical picture on
the paddle-box, possibly; big roomy boiler-deck, painted blue, and
furnished with Windsor armchairs; inside, a far-receding snow-white
‘cabin;’ porcelain knob and oil-picture on every stateroom door; curving
patterns of filigree-work touched up with gilding, stretching overhead
all down the converging vista; big chandeliers every little way, each an
April shower of glittering glass-drops; lovely rainbow-light falling
everywhere from the colored glazing of the skylights; the whole a long-
drawn, resplendent tunnel, a bewildering and soul-satisfying spectacle!
In the ladies’ cabin a pink and white Wilton carpet, as soft as mush,
and glorified with a ravishing pattern of gigantic flowers. Then the
Bridal Chamber–the animal that invented that idea was still alive and
unhanged, at that day–Bridal Chamber whose pretentious flummery was
necessarily overawing to the now tottering intellect of that hosannahing
citizen. Every state-room had its couple of cozy clean bunks, and
perhaps a looking-glass and a snug closet; and sometimes there was even
a washbowl and pitcher, and part of a towel which could be told from
mosquito netting by an expert–though generally these things were absent,
and the shirt-sleeved passengers cleansed themselves at a long row of
stationary bowls in the barber shop, where were also public towels,
public combs, and public soap.</p>
<p>Take the steamboat which I have just described, and you have her in
her highest and finest, and most pleasing, and comfortable, and
satisfactory estate. Now cake her over with a layer of ancient and
obdurate dirt, and you have the Cincinnati steamer awhile ago referred
to. Not all over–only inside; for she was ably officered in all
departments except the steward’s.</p>
<p>But wash that boat and repaint her, and she would be about the
counterpart of the most complimented boat of the old flush times: for
the steamboat architecture of the West has undergone no change; neither
has steamboat furniture and ornamentation undergone any.</p>
