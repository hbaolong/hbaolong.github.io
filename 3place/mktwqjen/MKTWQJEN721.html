<h4 id="chapter-xxxvi.">CHAPTER XXXVI.</h4>
<p>There are several good protections against temptations, but the
surest is cowardice. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>Names are not always what they seem. The common Welsh name Bzjxxllwep
is pronounced Jackson. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>Friday, December 13. Sailed, at 3 p.m., in the ‘Mararoa’. Summer seas
and a good ship-life has nothing better.</p>
<p>Monday. Three days of paradise. Warm and sunny and smooth; the sea a
luminous Mediterranean blue . . . . One lolls in a long chair all day
under deck-awnings, and reads and smokes, in measureless content. One
does not read prose at such a time, but poetry. I have been reading the
poems of Mrs. Julia A. Moore, again, and I find in them the same grace
and melody that attracted me when they were first published, twenty
years ago, and have held me in happy bonds ever since.</p>
<p>“The Sentimental Song Book“ has long been out of print, and has been
forgotten by the world in general, but not by me. I carry it with me
always–it and Goldsmith’s deathless story.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has the same deep charm for me that the Vicar of Wakefield
has, and I find in it the same subtle touch–the touch that makes an
intentionally humorous episode pathetic and an intentionally pathetic
one funny. In her time Mrs. Moore was called “the Sweet Singer of
Michigan,“ and was best known by that name. I have read her book through
twice today, with the purpose of determining which of her pieces has
most merit, and I am persuaded that for wide grasp and sustained power,
“William Upson“ may claim first place:</p>
<p>WILLIAM UPSON.</p>
<p>Air–“The Major’s Only Son.“ Come all good people far and near, Oh,
come and see what you can hear, It’s of a young man true and brave, That
is now sleeping in his grave.</p>
<p>Now, William Upson was his name If it’s not that, it’s all the same
He did enlist in a cruel strife, And it caused him to lose his life.</p>
<p>He was Perry Upson’s eldest son, His father loved his noble son, This
son was nineteen years of age When first in the rebellion he
engaged.</p>
<p>His father said that he might go, But his dear mother she said no,
“Oh! stay at home, dear Billy,“ she said, But she could not turn his
head.</p>
<p>He went to Nashville, in Tennessee, There his kind friends he could
not see; He died among strangers, so far away, They did not know where
his body lay.</p>
<p>He was taken sick and lived four weeks, And Oh! how his parents weep,
But now they must in sorrow mourn, For Billy has gone to his heavenly
home.</p>
<p>Oh! if his mother could have seen her son, For she loved him, her
darling son; If she could heard his dying prayer, It would ease her
heart till she met him there.</p>
<p>How it would relieve his mother’s heart To see her son from this
world depart, And hear his noble words of love, As he left this world
for that above.</p>
<p>Now it will relieve his mother’s heart, For her son is laid in our
graveyard; For now she knows that his grave is near, She will not shed
so many tears.</p>
<p>Although she knows not that it was her son, For his coffin could not
be opened It might be someone in his place, For she could not see his
noble face.</p>
<p>December, 17. Reached Sydney.</p>
<p>December, 19. In the train. Fellow of 30 with four valises; a slim
creature, with teeth which made his mouth look like a neglected
churchyard. He had solidified hair–solidified with pomatum; it was all
one shell. He smoked the most extraordinary cigarettes–made of some kind
of manure, apparently. These and his hair made him smell like the very
nation. He had a low-cut vest on, which exposed a deal of frayed and
broken and unclean shirtfront. Showy studs, of imitation gold–they had
made black disks on the linen. Oversized sleeve buttons of imitation
gold, the copper base showing through. Ponderous watch-chain of
imitation gold. I judge that he couldn’t tell the time by it, for he
asked Smythe what time it was, once. He wore a coat which had been gay
when it was young; 5-o’clock-tea-trousers of a light tint, and
marvelously soiled; yellow mustache with a dashing upward whirl at the
ends; foxy shoes, imitation patent leather. He was a novelty–an
imitation dude. He would have been a real one if he could have afforded
it. But he was satisfied with himself. You could see it in his
expression, and in all his attitudes and movements. He was living in a
dude dreamland where all his squalid shams were genuine, and himself a
sincerity. It disarmed criticism, it mollified spite, to see him so
enjoy his imitation languors, and arts, and airs, and his studied
daintinesses of gesture and misbegotten refinements. It was plain to me
that he was imagining himself the Prince of Wales, and was doing
everything the way he thought the Prince would do it. For bringing his
four valises aboard and stowing them in the nettings, he gave his porter
four cents, and lightly apologized for the smallness of the gratuity
–just with the condescendingest little royal air in the world. He
stretched himself out on the front seat and rested his pomatum-cake on
the middle arm, and stuck his feet out of the window, and began to pose
as the Prince and work his dreams and languors for exhibition; and he
would indolently watch the blue films curling up from his cigarette, and
inhale the stench, and look so grateful; and would flip the ash away
with the daintiest gesture, unintentionally displaying his brass ring in
the most intentional way; why, it was as good as being in Marlborough
House itself to see him do it so like.</p>
<p>There was other scenery in the trip. That of the Hawksbury river, in
the National Park region, fine–extraordinarily fine, with spacious views
of stream and lake imposingly framed in woody hills; and every now and
then the noblest groupings of mountains, and the most enchanting
rearrangements of the water effects. Further along, green flats, thinly
covered with gum forests, with here and there the huts and cabins of
small farmers engaged in raising children. Still further along, arid
stretches, lifeless and melancholy. Then Newcastle, a rushing town,
capital of the rich coal regions. Approaching Scone, wide farming and
grazing levels, with pretty frequent glimpses of a troublesome plant–a
particularly devilish little prickly pear, daily damned in the orisons
of the agriculturist; imported by a lady of sentiment, and contributed
gratis to the colony. Blazing hot, all day.</p>
<p>December 20. Back to Sydney. Blazing hot again. From the newspaper,
and from the map, I have made a collection of curious names of
Australasian towns, with the idea of making a poem out of them:</p>
<p>Tumut Takee Murriwillumba Bowral Ballarat Mullengudgery Murrurundi
Wagga-Wagga Wyalong Murrumbidgee Goomeroo Wolloway Wangary Wanilla
Worrow Koppio Yankalilla Yaranyacka Yackamoorundie Kaiwaka Coomooroo
Tauranga Geelong Tongariro Kaikoura Wakatipu Oohipara Waitpinga Goelwa
Munno Para Nangkita Myponga Kapunda Kooringa Penola Nangwarry Kongorong
Comaum Koolywurtie Killanoola Naracoorte Muloowurtie Binnum Wallaroo
Wirrega Mundoora Hauraki Rangiriri Teawamute Taranaki Toowoomba
Goondiwindi Jerrilderie Whangaroa Wollongong Woolloomooloo Bombola
Coolgardie Bendigo Coonamble Cootamundra Woolgoolga</p>
<p>Mittagong Jamberoo Kondoparinga Kuitpo Tungkillo Oukaparinga Talunga
Yatala Parawirra Moorooroo Whangarei Woolundunga Booleroo Pernatty
Parramatta Taroom Narrandera Deniliquin Kawakawa.</p>
<p>It may be best to build the poem now, and make the weather help</p>
<p>A SWELTERING DAY IN AUSTRALIA.</p>
<p>(To be read soft and low, with the lights turned down.)</p>
<p>The Bombola faints in the hot Bowral tree, Where fierce
Mullengudgery’s smothering fires Far from the breezes of Coolgardie Burn
ghastly and blue as the day expires;</p>
<p>And Murriwillumba complaineth in song For the garlanded bowers of
Woolloomooloo, And the Ballarat Fly and the lone Wollongong They dream
of the gardens of Jamberoo;</p>
<p>The wallabi sighs for the Murrubidgee, For the velvety sod of the
Munno Parah, Where the waters of healing from Muloowurtie Flow dim in
the gloaming by Yaranyackah;</p>
<p>The Koppio sorrows for lost Wolloway, And sigheth in secret for
Murrurundi, The Whangeroo wombat lamenteth the day That made him an
exile from Jerrilderie;</p>
<p>The Teawamute Tumut from Wirrega’s glade, The Nangkita swallow, the
Wallaroo swan, They long for the peace of the Timaru shade And thy balmy
soft airs, O sweet Mittagong!</p>
<p>The Kooringa buffalo pants in the sun, The Kondoparinga lies gaping
for breath, The Kongorong Camaum to the shadow has won, But the Goomeroo
sinks in the slumber of death;</p>
<p>In the weltering hell of the Moorooroo plain The Yatala Wangary
withers and dies, And the Worrow Wanilla, demented with pain, To the
Woolgoolga woodlands despairingly flies;</p>
<p>Sweet Nangwarry’s desolate, Coonamble wails, And Tungkillo Kuito in
sables is drest, For the Whangerei winds fall asleep in the sails And
the Booleroo life-breeze is dead in the west.</p>
<p>Mypongo, Kapunda, O slumber no more Yankalilla, Parawirra, be warned
There’s death in the air! Killanoola, wherefore Shall the prayer of
Penola be scorned?</p>
<p>Cootamundra, and Takee, and Wakatipu, Toowoomba, Kaikoura are lost
From Onkaparinga to far Oamaru All burn in this hell’s holocaust!</p>
<p>Paramatta and Binnum are gone to their rest In the vale of Tapanni
Taroom, Kawakawa, Deniliquin–all that was best In the earth are but
graves and a tomb!</p>
<p>Narrandera mourns, Cameron answers not When the roll of the scathless
we cry Tongariro, Goondiwindi, Woolundunga, the spot Is mute and forlorn
where ye lie.</p>
<p>Those are good words for poetry. Among the best I have ever seen.
There are 81 in the list. I did not need them all, but I have knocked
down 66 of them; which is a good bag, it seems to me, for a person not
in the business. Perhaps a poet laureate could do better, but a poet
laureate gets wages, and that is different. When I write poetry I do not
get any wages; often I lose money by it. The best word in that list, and
the most musical and gurgly, is Woolloomoolloo. It is a place near
Sydney, and is a favorite pleasure-resort. It has eight O’s in it.</p>
