<h4 id="chapter-xxix.">CHAPTER XXIX.</h4>
<p>Philip Sterling was on his way to Ilium, in the state of
Pennsylvania. Ilium was the railway station nearest to the tract of wild
land which Mr. Bolton had commissioned him to examine.</p>
<p>On the last day of the journey as the railway train Philip was on was
leaving a large city, a lady timidly entered the drawing-room car, and
hesitatingly took a chair that was at the moment unoccupied. Philip saw
from the window that a gentleman had put her upon the car just as it was
starting. In a few moments the conductor entered, and without waiting an
explanation, said roughly to the lady,</p>
<p>“Now you can’t sit there. That seat’s taken. Go into the other
car.“</p>
<p>“I did not intend to take the seat,“ said the lady rising, “I only
sat down a moment till the conductor should come and give me a
seat.“</p>
<p>“There aint any. Car’s full. You’ll have to leave.“</p>
<p>“But, sir,“ said the lady, appealingly, “I thought–“</p>
<p>“Can’t help what you thought–you must go into the other car.“</p>
<p>“The train is going very fast, let me stand here till we stop.“</p>
<p>“The lady can have my seat,“ cried Philip, springing up.</p>
<p>The conductor turned towards Philip, and coolly and deliberately
surveyed him from head to foot, with contempt in every line of his face,
turned his back upon him without a word, and said to the lady,</p>
<p>“Come, I’ve got no time to talk. You must go now.“</p>
<p>The lady, entirely disconcerted by such rudeness, and frightened,
moved towards the door, opened it and stepped out. The train was
swinging along at a rapid rate, jarring from side to side; the step was
a long one between the cars and there was no protecting grating. The
lady attempted it, but lost her balance, in the wind and the motion of
the car, and fell! She would inevitably have gone down under the wheels,
if Philip, who had swiftly followed her, had not caught her arm and
drawn her up. He then assisted her across, found her a seat, received
her bewildered thanks, and returned to his car.</p>
<p>The conductor was still there, taking his tickets, and growling
something about imposition. Philip marched up to him, and burst out
with,</p>
<p>“You are a brute, an infernal brute, to treat a woman that way.“</p>
<p>“Perhaps you’d like to make a fuss about it,“ sneered the
conductor.</p>
<p>Philip’s reply was a blow, given so suddenly and planted so squarely
in the conductor’s face, that it sent him reeling over a fat passenger,
who was looking up in mild wonder that any one should dare to dispute
with a conductor, and against the side of the car.</p>
<p>He recovered himself, reached the bell rope, “Damn you, I’ll learn
you,“ stepped to the door and called a couple of brakemen, and then, as
the speed slackened; roared out,</p>
<p>“Get off this train.“</p>
<p>“I shall not get off. I have as much right here as you.“</p>
<p>“We’ll see,“ said the conductor, advancing with the brakemen. The
passengers protested, and some of them said to each other, “That’s too
bad,“ as they always do in such cases, but none of them offered to take
a hand with Philip. The men seized him, wrenched him from his seat,
dragged him along the aisle, tearing his clothes, thrust him from the
car, and, then flung his carpet-bag, overcoat and umbrella after him.
And the train went on.</p>
<p>The conductor, red in the face and puffing from his exertion,
swaggered through the car, muttering “Puppy, I’ll learn him.“ The
passengers, when he had gone, were loud in their indignation, and talked
about signing a protest, but they did nothing more than talk.</p>
<p>The next morning the Hooverville Patriot and Clarion had this
“item“:–</p>
<p>SLIGHTUALLY OVERBOARD.</p>
<p>“We learn that as the down noon express was leaving H—- yesterday a
lady! (God save the mark) attempted to force herself into the already
full palatial car. Conductor Slum, who is too old a bird to be caught
with chaff, courteously informed her that the car was full, and when she
insisted on remaining, he persuaded her to go into the car where she
belonged. Thereupon a young sprig, from the East, blustered like a
Shanghai rooster, and began to sass the conductor with his chin music.
That gentleman delivered the young aspirant for a muss one of his
elegant little left-handers, which so astonished him that he began to
feel for his shooter. Whereupon Mr. Slum gently raised the youth,
carried him forth, and set him down just outside the car to cool off.
Whether the young blood has yet made his way out of Bascom’s swamp, we
have not learned. Conductor Slum is one of the most gentlemanly and
efficient officers on the road; but he ain’t trifled with, not much. We
learn that the company have put a new engine on the seven o’clock train,
and newly upholstered the drawing-room car throughout. It spares no
effort for the comfort of the traveling public.“</p>
<p>Philip never had been before in Bascom’s swamp, and there was nothing
inviting in it to detain him. After the train got out of the way he
crawled out of the briars and the mud, and got upon the track. He was
somewhat bruised, but he was too angry to mind that. He plodded along
over the ties in a very hot condition of mind and body. In the scuffle,
his railway check had disappeared, and he grimly wondered, as he noticed
the loss, if the company would permit him to walk over their track if
they should know he hadn’t a ticket.</p>
<p>Philip had to walk some five miles before he reached a little
station, where he could wait for a train, and he had ample time for
reflection. At first he was full of vengeance on the company. He would
sue it. He would make it pay roundly. But then it occurred to him that
he did not know the name of a witness he could summon, and that a
personal fight against a railway corporation was about the most hopeless
in the world. He then thought he would seek out that conductor, lie in
wait for him at some station, and thrash him, or get thrashed
himself.</p>
<p>But as he got cooler, that did not seem to him a project worthy of a
gentleman exactly. Was it possible for a gentleman to get even with such
a fellow as that conductor on the letter’s own plane? And when he came
to this point, he began to ask himself, if he had not acted very much
like a fool. He didn’t regret striking the fellow–he hoped he had left a
mark on him. But, after all, was that the best way? Here was he, Philip
Sterling, calling himself a gentleman, in a brawl with a vulgar
conductor, about a woman he had never seen before. Why should he have
put himself in such a ridiculous position? Wasn’t it enough to have
offered the lady his seat, to have rescued her from an accident, perhaps
from death? Suppose he had simply said to the conductor, “Sir, your
conduct is brutal, I shall report you.“ The passengers, who saw the
affair, might have joined in a report against the conductor, and he
might really have accomplished something. And, now! Philip looked at
leis torn clothes, and thought with disgust of his haste in getting into
a fight with such an autocrat.</p>
<p>At the little station where Philip waited for the next train, he met
a man–who turned out to be a justice of the peace in that neighborhood,
and told him his adventure. He was a kindly sort of man, and seemed very
much interested.</p>
<p>“Dum ’em,“ said he, when he had heard the story.</p>
<p>“Do you think any thing can be done, sir?“</p>
<p>“Wal, I guess tain’t no use. I hain’t a mite of doubt of every word
you say. But suin’s no use. The railroad company owns all these people
along here, and the judges on the bench too. Spiled your clothes! Wal,
‘least said’s soonest mended.’ You haint no chance with the
company.“</p>
<p>When next morning, he read the humorous account in the Patriot and
Clarion, he saw still more clearly what chance he would have had before
the public in a fight with the railroad company.</p>
<p>Still Philip’s conscience told him that it was his plain duty to
carry the matter into the courts, even with the certainty of defeat. He
confessed that neither he nor any citizen had a right to consult his own
feelings or conscience in a case where a law of the land had been
violated before his own eyes. He confessed that every citizen’s first
duty in such case is to put aside his own business and devote his time
and his best efforts to seeing that the infraction is promptly punished;
and he knew that no country can be well governed unless its citizens as
a body keep religiously before their minds that they are the guardians
of the law, and that the law officers are only the machinery for its
execution, nothing more. As a finality he was obliged to confess that he
was a bad citizen, and also that the general laxity of the time, and the
absence of a sense of duty toward any part of the community but the
individual himself were ingrained in him, am he was no better than the
rest of the people.</p>
<p>The result of this little adventure was that Philip did not reach
Ilium till daylight the next morning, when he descended sleepy and sore,
from a way train, and looked about him. Ilium was in a narrow mountain
gorge, through which a rapid stream ran. It consisted of the plank
platform on which he stood, a wooden house, half painted, with a dirty
piazza (unroofed) in front, and a sign board hung on a slanting
pole–bearing the legend, “Hotel. P. Dusenheimer,“ a sawmill further down
the stream, a blacksmith-shop, and a store, and three or four unpainted
dwellings of the slab variety.</p>
<p>As Philip approached the hotel he saw what appeared to be a wild
beast crouching on the piazza. It did not stir, however, and he soon
found that it was only a stuffed skin. This cheerful invitation to the
tavern was the remains of a huge panther which had been killed in the
region a few weeks before. Philip examined his ugly visage and strong
crooked fore-arm, as he was waiting admittance, having pounded upon the
door.</p>
<p>“Yait a bit. I’ll shoost–put on my trowsers,“ shouted a voice from
the window, and the door was soon opened by the yawning landlord.</p>
<p>“Morgen! Didn’t hear d’ drain oncet. Dem boys geeps me up zo spate.
Gom right in.“</p>
<p>Philip was shown into a dirty bar-room. It was a small room, with a
stove in the middle, set in a long shallow box of sand, for the benefit
of the “spitters,“ a bar across one end–a mere counter with a sliding
glass-case behind it containing a few bottles having ambitious labels,
and a wash-sink in one corner. On the walls were the bright yellow and
black handbills of a traveling circus, with pictures of acrobats in
human pyramids, horses flying in long leaps through the air, and
sylph-like women in a paradisaic costume, balancing themselves upon the
tips of their toes on the bare backs of frantic and plunging steeds, and
kissing their hands to the spectators meanwhile.</p>
<p>As Philip did not desire a room at that hour, he was invited to wash
himself at the nasty sink, a feat somewhat easier than drying his face,
for the towel that hung in a roller over the sink was evidently as much
a fixture as the sink itself, and belonged, like the suspended brush and
comb, to the traveling public. Philip managed to complete his toilet by
the use of his pocket-handkerchief, and declining the hospitality of the
landlord, implied in the remark, “You won’d dake notin’?“ he went into
the open air to wait for breakfast.</p>
<p>The country he saw was wild but not picturesque. The mountain before
him might be eight hundred feet high, and was only a portion of a long
unbroken range, savagely wooded, which followed the stream. Behind the
hotel, and across the brawling brook, was another level-topped, wooded
range exactly like it. Ilium itself, seen at a glance, was old enough to
be dilapidated, and if it had gained anything by being made a wood and
water station of the new railroad, it was only a new sort of grime and
rawness. P. Dusenheimer, standing in the door of his uninviting
groggery, when the trains stopped for water; never received from the
traveling public any patronage except facetious remarks upon his
personal appearance. Perhaps a thousand times he had heard the remark,
“Ilium fuit,“ followed in most instances by a hail to himself as
“AEneas,“ with the inquiry “Where is old Anchises?“ At first he had
replied, “Dere ain’t no such man;“ but irritated by its senseless
repetition, he had latterly dropped into the formula of, “You be
dam.“</p>
<p>Philip was recalled from the contemplation of Ilium by the rolling
and growling of the gong within the hotel, the din and clamor increasing
till the house was apparently unable to contain it; when it burst out of
the front door and informed the world that breakfast was on the
table.</p>
<p>The dining room was long, low and narrow, and a narrow table extended
its whole length. Upon this was spread a cloth which from appearance
might have been as long in use as the towel in the barroom. Upon the
table was the usual service, the heavy, much nicked stone ware, the row
of plated and rusty castors, the sugar bowls with the zinc tea-spoons
sticking up in them, the piles of yellow biscuits, the
discouraged-looking plates of butter. The landlord waited, and Philip
was pleased to observe the change in his manner. In the barroom he was
the conciliatory landlord. Standing behind his guests at table, he had
an air of peremptory patronage, and the voice in which he shot out the
inquiry, as he seized Philip’s plate, “Beefsteak or liver?“ quite took
away Philip’s power of choice. He begged for a glass of milk, after
trying that green hued compound called coffee, and made his breakfast
out of that and some hard crackers which seemed to have been imported
into Ilium before the introduction of the iron horse, and to have
withstood a ten years siege of regular boarders, Greeks and others.</p>
<p>The land that Philip had come to look at was at least five miles
distant from Ilium station. A corner of it touched the railroad, but the
rest was pretty much an unbroken wilderness, eight or ten thousand acres
of rough country, most of it such a mountain range as he saw at
Ilium.</p>
<p>His first step was to hire three woodsmen to accompany him. By their
help he built a log hut, and established a camp on the land, and then
began his explorations, mapping down his survey as he went along, noting
the timber, and the lay of the land, and making superficial observations
as to the prospect of coal.</p>
<p>The landlord at Ilium endeavored to persuade Philip to hire the
services of a witch-hazel professor of that region, who could walk over
the land with his wand and tell him infallibly whether it contained
coal, and exactly where the strata ran. But Philip preferred to trust to
his own study of the country, and his knowledge of the geological
formation. He spent a month in traveling over the land and making
calculations; and made up his mind that a fine vein of coal ran through
the mountain about a mile from the railroad, and that the place to run
in a tunnel was half way towards its summit.</p>
<p>Acting with his usual promptness, Philip, with the consent of
Mr. Bolton, broke ground there at once, and, before snow came, had some
rude buildings up, and was ready for active operations in the spring. It
was true that there were no outcroppings of coal at the place, and the
people at Ilium said he “mought as well dig for plug terbaccer there;“
but Philip had great faith in the uniformity of nature’s operations in
ages past, and he had no doubt that he should strike at this spot the
rich vein that had made the fortune of the Golden Briar Company.</p>
