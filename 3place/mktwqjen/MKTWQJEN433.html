<h4 id="chapter-50-the-original-jacobs">Chapter 50 The ‘Original
Jacobs’</h4>
<p>WE had some talk about Captain Isaiah Sellers, now many years dead.
He was a fine man, a high-minded man, and greatly respected both ashore
and on the river. He was very tall, well built, and handsome; and in his
old age–as I remember him–his hair was as black as an Indian’s, and his
eye and hand were as strong and steady and his nerve and judgment as
firm and clear as anybody’s, young or old, among the fraternity of
pilots. He was the patriarch of the craft; he had been a keelboat pilot
before the day of steamboats; and a steamboat pilot before any other
steamboat pilot, still surviving at the time I speak of, had ever turned
a wheel. Consequently his brethren held him in the sort of awe in which
illustrious survivors of a bygone age are always held by their
associates. He knew how he was regarded, and perhaps this fact added
some trifle of stiffening to his natural dignity, which had been
sufficiently stiff in its original state.</p>
<p>He left a diary behind him; but apparently it did not date back to
his first steamboat trip, which was said to be 1811, the year the first
steamboat disturbed the waters of the Mississippi. At the time of his
death a correspondent of the ‘St. Louis Republican’ culled the following
items from the diary–</p>
<p>’In February, 1825, he shipped on board the steamer “Rambler,“ at
Florence, Ala., and made during that year three trips to New Orleans and
back–this on the “Gen. Carrol,“ between Nashville and New Orleans. It
was during his stay on this boat that Captain Sellers introduced the tap
of the bell as a signal to heave the lead, previous to which time it was
the custom for the pilot to speak to the men below when soundings were
wanted. The proximity of the forecastle to the pilot-house, no doubt,
rendered this an easy matter; but how different on one of our palaces of
the present day.</p>
<p>’In 1827 we find him on board the “President,“ a boat of two hundred
and eighty-five tons burden, and plying between Smithland and New
Orleans. Thence he joined the “Jubilee“ in 1828, and on this boat he did
his first piloting in the St. Louis trade; his first watch extending
from Herculaneum to St. Genevieve. On May 26, 1836, he completed and
left Pittsburgh in charge of the steamer “Prairie,“ a boat of four
hundred tons, and the first steamer with a STATE-ROOM CABIN ever seen at
St. Louis. In 1857 he introduced the signal for meeting boats, and which
has, with some slight change, been the universal custom of this day; in
fact, is rendered obligatory by act of Congress.</p>
<p>’As general items of river history, we quote the following marginal
notes from his general log–</p>
<p>’In March, 1825, Gen. Lafayette left New Orleans for St. Louis on the
low-pressure steamer “Natchez.“</p>
<p>’In January, 1828, twenty-one steamers left the New Orleans wharf to
celebrate the occasion of Gen. Jackson’s visit to that city.</p>
<p>’In 1830 the “North American“ made the run from New Orleans to
Memphis in six days–best time on record to that date. It has since been
made in two days and ten hours.</p>
<p>’In 1831 the Red River cut-off formed.</p>
<p>’In 1832 steamer “Hudson“ made the run from White River to Helena, a
distance of seventy-five miles, in twelve hours. This was the source of
much talk and speculation among parties directly interested.</p>
<p>’In 1839 Great Horseshoe cut-off formed.</p>
<p>‘Up to the present time, a term of thirty-five years, we ascertain,
by reference to the diary, he has made four hundred and sixty round
trips to New Orleans, which gives a distance of one million one hundred
and four thousand miles, or an average of eighty-six miles a day.’</p>
<p>Whenever Captain Sellers approached a body of gossiping pilots, a
chill fell there, and talking ceased. For this reason: whenever six
pilots were gathered together, there would always be one or two newly
fledged ones in the lot, and the elder ones would be always ‘showing
off’ before these poor fellows; making them sorrowfully feel how callow
they were, how recent their nobility, and how humble their degree, by
talking largely and vaporously of old-time experiences on the river;
always making it a point to date everything back as far as they could,
so as to make the new men feel their newness to the sharpest degree
possible, and envy the old stagers in the like degree. And how these
complacent baldheads WOULD swell, and brag, and lie, and date back–ten,
fifteen, twenty years,–and how they did enjoy the effect produced upon
the marveling and envying youngsters!</p>
<p>And perhaps just at this happy stage of the proceedings, the stately
figure of Captain Isaiah Sellers, that real and only genuine Son of
Antiquity, would drift solemnly into the midst. Imagine the size of the
silence that would result on the instant. And imagine the feelings of
those bald-heads, and the exultation of their recent audience when the
ancient captain would begin to drop casual and indifferent remarks of a
reminiscent nature–about islands that had disappeared, and cutoffs that
had been made, a generation before the oldest bald-head in the company
had ever set his foot in a pilot-house!</p>
<p>Many and many a time did this ancient mariner appear on the scene in
the above fashion, and spread disaster and humiliation around him. If
one might believe the pilots, he always dated his islands back to the
misty dawn of river history; and he never used the same island twice;
and never did he employ an island that still existed, or give one a name
which anybody present was old enough to have heard of before. If you
might believe the pilots, he was always conscientiously particular about
little details; never spoke of ‘the State of Mississippi,’ for instance
–no, he would say, ‘When the State of Mississippi was where Arkansas now
is,’ and would never speak of Louisiana or Missouri in a general way,
and leave an incorrect impression on your mind–no, he would say, ‘When
Louisiana was up the river farther,’ or ‘When Missouri was on the
Illinois side.’</p>
<p>The old gentleman was not of literary turn or capacity, but he used
to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the
river, and sign them ‘MARK TWAIN,’ and give them to the ‘New Orleans
Picayune.’ They related to the stage and condition of the river, and
were accurate and valuable; and thus far, they contained no poison. But
in speaking of the stage of the river to-day, at a given point, the
captain was pretty apt to drop in a little remark about this being the
first time he had seen the water so high or so low at that particular
point for forty-nine years; and now and then he would mention Island So-
and-so, and follow it, in parentheses, with some such observation as
‘disappeared in 1807, if I remember rightly.’ In these antique
interjections lay poison and bitterness for the other old pilots, and
they used to chaff the ‘Mark Twain’ paragraphs with unsparing
mockery.</p>
<p>It so chanced that one of these paragraphs–{footnote [The original
MS. of it, in the captain’s own hand, has been sent to me from New
Orleans. It reads as follows–</p>
<p>VICKSBURG May 4, 1859.</p>
<p>’My opinion for the benefit of the citizens of New Orleans: The water
is higher this far up than it has been since 8. My opinion is that the
water will be feet deep in Canal street before the first of next June.
Mrs. Turner’s plantation at the head of Big Black Island is all under
water, and it has not been since 1815.</p>
<p>‘I. Sellers.’]}</p>
<p>became the text for my first newspaper article. I burlesqued it
broadly, very broadly, stringing my fantastics out to the extent of
eight hundred or a thousand words. I was a ‘cub’ at the time. I showed
my performance to some pilots, and they eagerly rushed it into print in
the ‘New Orleans True Delta.’ It was a great pity; for it did nobody any
worthy service, and it sent a pang deep into a good man’s heart. There
was no malice in my rubbish; but it laughed at the captain. It laughed
at a man to whom such a thing was new and strange and dreadful. I did
not know then, though I do now, that there is no suffering comparable
with that which a private person feels when he is for the first time
pilloried in print.</p>
<p>Captain Sellers did me the honor to profoundly detest me from that
day forth. When I say he did me the honor, I am not using empty words.
It was a very real honor to be in the thoughts of so great a man as
Captain Sellers, and I had wit enough to appreciate it and be proud of
it. It was distinction to be loved by such a man; but it was a much
greater distinction to be hated by him, because he loved scores of
people; but he didn’t sit up nights to hate anybody but me.</p>
<p>He never printed another paragraph while he lived, and he never again
signed ‘Mark Twain’ to anything. At the time that the telegraph brought
the news of his death, I was on the Pacific coast. I was a fresh new
journalist, and needed a nom de guerre; so I confiscated the ancient
mariner’s discarded one, and have done my best to make it remain what it
was in his hands–a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in
its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth; how I have
succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.</p>
<p>The captain had an honorable pride in his profession and an abiding
love for it. He ordered his monument before he died, and kept it near
him until he did die. It stands over his grave now, in Bellefontaine
cemetery, St. Louis. It is his image, in marble, standing on duty at the
pilot wheel; and worthy to stand and confront criticism, for it
represents a man who in life would have stayed there till he burned to a
cinder, if duty required it.</p>
<p>The finest thing we saw on our whole Mississippi trip, we saw as we
approached New Orleans in the steam-tug. This was the curving frontage
of the crescent city lit up with the white glare of five miles of
electric lights. It was a wonderful sight, and very beautiful.</p>
