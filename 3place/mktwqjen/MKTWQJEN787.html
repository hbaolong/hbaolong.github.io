XIII of THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM RESTATED bears the heading “Shakespeare
as a Lawyer,“ and comprises some fifty pages of expert testimony, with
comments thereon, and I will copy the first nine, as being sufficient
all by themselves, as it seems to me, to settle the question which I
have conceived to be the master-key to the Shakespeare-Bacon
puzzle.</h4>
<p>VIII</p>
<p>Shakespeare as a Lawyer [1]</p>
<p>The Plays and Poems of Shakespeare supply ample evidence that their
author not only had a very extensive and accurate knowledge of law, but
that he was well acquainted with the manners and customs of members of
the Inns of Court and with legal life generally.</p>
<p>“While novelists and dramatists are constantly making mistakes as to
the laws of marriage, of wills, of inheritance, to Shakespeare’s law,
lavishly as he expounds it, there can neither be demurrer, nor bill of
exceptions, nor writ of error.“ Such was the testimony borne by one of
the most distinguished lawyers of the nineteenth century who was raised
to the high office of Lord Chief Justice in 1850, and subsequently
became Lord Chancellor. Its weight will, doubtless, be more appreciated
by lawyers than by laymen, for only lawyers know how impossible it is
for those who have not served an apprenticeship to the law to avoid
displaying their ignorance if they venture to employ legal terms and to
discuss legal doctrines. “There is nothing so dangerous,“ wrote Lord
Campbell, “as for one not of the craft to tamper with our freemasonry.“
A layman is certain to betray himself by using some expression which a
lawyer would never employ. Mr. Sidney Lee himself supplies us with an
example of this. He writes (p. 164): “On February 15, 1609, Shakespeare
. . . obtained judgment from a jury against Addenbroke for the payment
of No. 6, and No. 1, 5s. 0d. costs.“ Now a lawyer would never have
spoken of obtaining “judgment from a jury,“ for it is the function of a
jury not to deliver judgment (which is the prerogative of the court),
but to find a verdict on the facts. The error is, indeed, a venial one,
but it is just one of those little things which at once enable a lawyer
to know if the writer is a layman or “one of the craft.“</p>
<p>But when a layman ventures to plunge deeply into legal subjects, he
is naturally apt to make an exhibition of his incompetence. “Let a
non-professional man, however acute,“ writes Lord Campbell again,
“presume to talk law, or to draw illustrations from legal science in
discussing other subjects, and he will speedily fall into laughable
absurdity.“</p>
<p>And what does the same high authority say about Shakespeare? He had
“a deep technical knowledge of the law,“ and an easy familiarity with
“some of the most abstruse proceedings in English jurisprudence.“ And
again: “Whenever he indulges this propensity he uniformly lays down good
law.“ Of “Henry IV.,“ Part 2, he says: “If Lord Eldon could be supposed
to have written the play, I do not see how he could be chargeable with
having forgotten any of his law while writing it.“ Charles and Mary
Cowden Clarke speak of “the marvelous intimacy which he displays with
legal terms, his frequent adoption of them in illustration, and his
curiously technical knowledge of their form and force.“ Malone, himself
a lawyer, wrote: “His knowledge of legal terms is not merely such as
might be acquired by the casual observation of even his
all-comprehending mind; it has the appearance of technical skill.“
Another lawyer and well-known Shakespearean, Richard Grant White, says:
“No dramatist of the time, not even Beaumont, who was the younger son of
a judge of the Common Pleas, and who after studying in the Inns of Court
abandoned law for the drama, used legal phrases with Shakespeare’s
readiness and exactness. And the significance of this fact is heightened
by another, that is only to the language of the law that he exhibits
this inclination. The phrases peculiar to other occupations serve him on
rare occasions by way of description, comparison, or illustration,
generally when something in the scene suggests them, but legal phrases
flow from his pen as part of his vocabulary and parcel of his thought.
Take the word ‘purchase’ for instance, which, in ordinary use, means to
acquire by giving value, but applies in law to all legal modes of
obtaining property except by inheritance or descent, and in this
peculiar sense the word occurs five times in Shakespeare’s thirty-four
plays, and only in one single instance in the fifty-four plays of
Beaumont and Fletcher. It has been suggested that it was in attendance
upon the courts in London that he picked up his legal vocabulary. But
this supposition not only fails to account for Shakespeare’s peculiar
freedom and exactness in the use of that phraseology, it does not even
place him in the way of learning those terms his use of which is most
remarkable, which are not such as he would have heard at ordinary
proceedings at NISI PRIUS, but such as refer to the tenure or transfer
of real property, ‘fine and recovery,’ ‘statutes merchant,’ ‘purchase,’
‘indenture,’ ‘tenure,’ ‘double voucher,’ ‘fee simple,’ ‘fee farm,’
‘remainder,’ ‘reversion,’ ‘forfeiture,’ etc. This conveyancer’s jargon
could not have been picked up by hanging round the courts of law in
London two hundred and fifty years ago, when suits as to the title of
real property were comparatively rare. And besides, Shakespeare uses his
law just as freely in his first plays, written in his first London
years, as in those produced at a later period. Just as exactly, too; for
the correctness and propriety with which these terms are introduced have
compelled the admiration of a Chief Justice and a Lord Chancellor.“</p>
<p>Senator Davis wrote: “We seem to have something more than a
sciolist’s temerity of indulgence in the terms of an unfamiliar art. No
legal solecisms will be found. The abstrusest elements of the common law
are impressed into a disciplined service. Over and over again, where
such knowledge is unexampled in writers unlearned in the law,
Shakespeare appears in perfect possession of it. In the law of real
property, its rules of tenure and descents, its entails, its fines and
recoveries, their vouchers and double vouchers, in the procedure of the
Courts, the method of bringing writs and arrests, the nature of actions,
the rules of pleading, the law of escapes and of contempt of court, in
the principles of evidence, both technical and philosophical, in the
distinction between the temporal and spiritual tribunals, in the law of
attainder and forfeiture, in the requisites of a valid marriage, in the
presumption of legitimacy, in the learning of the law of prerogative, in
the inalienable character of the Crown, this mastership appears with
surprising authority.“</p>
<p>To all this testimony (and there is much more which I have not cited)
may now be added that of a great lawyer of our own times, VIZ.: Sir
James Plaisted Wilde, Q.C. 1855, created a Baron of the Exchequer in
1860, promoted to the post of Judge-Ordinary and Judge of the Courts of
Probate and Divorce in 1863, and better known to the world as Lord
Penzance, to which dignity he was raised in 1869. Lord Penzance, as all
lawyers know, and as the late Mr. Inderwick, K.C., has testified, was
one of the first legal authorities of his day, famous for his
“remarkable grasp of legal principles,“ and “endowed by nature with a
remarkable facility for marshaling facts, and for a clear expression of
his views.“</p>
<p>Lord Penzance speaks of Shakespeare’s “perfect familiarity with not
only the principles, axioms, and maxims, but the technicalities of
English law, a knowledge so perfect and intimate that he was never
incorrect and never at fault. . . . The mode in which this knowledge was
pressed into service on all occasions to express his meaning and
illustrate his thoughts was quite unexampled. He seems to have had a
special pleasure in his complete and ready mastership of it in all its
branches. As manifested in the plays, this legal knowledge and learning
had therefore a special character which places it on a wholly different
footing from the rest of the multifarious knowledge which is exhibited
in page after page of the plays. At every turn and point at which the
author required a metaphor, simile, or illustration, his mind ever
turned FIRST to the law. He seems almost to have THOUGHT in legal
phrases, the commonest of legal expressions were ever at the end of his
pen in description or illustration. That he should have descanted in
lawyer language when he had a forensic subject in hand, such as
Shylock’s bond, was to be expected, but the knowledge of law in
‘Shakespeare’ was exhibited in a far different manner: it protruded
itself on all occasions, appropriate or inappropriate, and mingled
itself with strains of thought widely divergent from forensic subjects.“
Again: “To acquire a perfect familiarity with legal principles, and an
accurate and ready use of the technical terms and phrases not only of
the conveyancer’s office, but of the pleader’s chambers and the Courts
at Westminster, nothing short of employment in some career involving
constant contact with legal questions and general legal work would be
requisite. But a continuous employment involves the element of time, and
time was just what the manager of two theaters had not at his disposal.
In what portion of Shakespeare’s (i.e., Shakspere’s) career would it be
possible to point out that time could be found for the interposition of
a legal employment in the chambers or offices of practicing
lawyers?“</p>
<p>Stratfordians, as is well known, casting about for some possible
explanation of Shakespeare’s extraordinary knowledge of law, have made
the suggestion that Shakespeare might, conceivably, have been a clerk in
an attorney’s office before he came to London. Mr. Collier wrote to Lord
Campbell to ask his opinion as to the probability of this being true.
His answer was as follows: “You require us to believe implicitly a fact,
of which, if true, positive and irrefragable evidence in his own
handwriting might have been forthcoming to establish it. Not having been
actually enrolled as an attorney, neither the records of the local court
at Stratford nor of the superior Court at Westminster would present his
name as being concerned in any suit as an attorney, but it might
reasonably have been expected that there would be deeds or wills
witnessed by him still extant, and after a very diligent search none
such can be discovered.“</p>
<p>Upon this Lord Penzance commends: “It cannot be doubted that Lord
Campbell was right in this. No young man could have been at work in an
attorney’s office without being called upon continually to act as a
witness, and in many other ways leaving traces of his work and name.“
There is not a single fact or incident in all that is known of
Shakespeare, even by rumor or tradition, which supports this notion of a
clerkship. And after much argument and surmise which has been indulged
in on this subject, we may, I think, safely put the notion on one side,
for no less an authority than Mr. Grant White says finally that the idea
of his having been clerk to an attorney has been “blown to pieces.“</p>
<p>It is altogether characteristic of Mr. Churton Collins that he,
nevertheless, adopts this exploded myth. “That Shakespeare was in early
life employed as a clerk in an attorney’s office may be correct. At
Stratford there was by royal charter a Court of Record sitting every
fortnight, with six attorneys, besides the town clerk, belonging to it,
and it is certainly not straining probability to suppose that the young
Shakespeare may have had employment in one of them. There is, it is
true, no tradition to this effect, but such traditions as we have about
Shakespeare’s occupation between the time of leaving school and going to
London are so loose and baseless that no confidence can be placed in
them. It is, to say the least, more probable that he was in an
attorney’s office than that he was a butcher killing calves ‘in a high
style,’ and making speeches over them.“</p>
<p>This is a charming specimen of Stratfordian argument. There is, as we
have seen, a very old tradition that Shakespeare was a butcher’s
apprentice. John Dowdall, who made a tour of Warwickshire in 1693,
testifies to it as coming from the old clerk who showed him over the
church, and it is unhesitatingly accepted as true by
Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps. (Vol. I, p. 11, and Vol. II, pp. 71, 72.)
Mr. Sidney Lee sees nothing improbable in it, and it is supported by
Aubrey, who must have written his account some time before 1680, when
his manuscript was completed. Of the attorney’s clerk hypothesis, on the
other hand, there is not the faintest vestige of a tradition. It has
been evolved out of the fertile imaginations of embarrassed
Stratfordians, seeking for some explanation of the Stratford rustic’s
marvelous acquaintance with law and legal terms and legal life. But
Mr. Churton Collins has not the least hesitation in throwing over the
tradition which has the warrant of antiquity and setting up in its stead
this ridiculous invention, for which not only is there no shred of
positive evidence, but which, as Lord Campbell and Lord Penzance pointed
out, is really put out of court by the negative evidence, since “no
young man could have been at work in an attorney’s office without being
called upon continually to act as a witness, and in many other ways
leaving traces of his work and name.“ And as Mr. Edwards further points
out, since the day when Lord Campbell’s book was published (between
forty and fifty years ago), “every old deed or will, to say nothing of
other legal papers, dated during the period of William Shakespeare’s
youth, has been scrutinized over half a dozen shires, and not one
signature of the young man has been found.“</p>
<p>Moreover, if Shakespeare had served as clerk in an attorney’s office
it is clear that he must have served for a considerable period in order
to have gained (if, indeed, it is credible that he could have so gained)
his remarkable knowledge of the law. Can we then for a moment believe
that, if this had been so, tradition would have been absolutely silent
on the matter? That Dowdall’s old clerk, over eighty years of age,
should have never heard of it (though he was sure enough about the
butcher’s apprentice) and that all the other ancient witnesses should be
in similar ignorance!</p>
<p>But such are the methods of Stratfordian controversy. Tradition is to
be scouted when it is found inconvenient, but cited as irrefragable
truth when it suits the case. Shakespeare of Stratford was the author of
the Plays and Poems, but the author of the Plays and Poems could not
have been a butcher’s apprentice. Anyway, therefore, with tradition. But
the author of the Plays and Poems MUST have had a very large and a very
accurate knowledge of the law. Therefore, Shakespeare of Stratford must
have been an attorney’s clerk! The method is simplicity itself. By
similar reasoning Shakespeare has been made a country schoolmaster, a
soldier, a physician, a printer, and a good many other things besides,
according to the inclination and the exigencies of the commentator. It
would not be in the least surprising to find that he was studying Latin
as a schoolmaster and law in an attorney’s office at the same time.</p>
<p>However, we must do Mr. Collins the justice of saying that he has
fully recognized, what is indeed tolerable obvious, that Shakespeare
must have had a sound legal training. “It may, of course, be urged,“ he
writes, “that Shakespeare’s knowledge of medicine, and particularly that
branch of it which related to morbid psychology, is equally remarkable,
and that no one has ever contended that he was a physician. (Here
Mr. Collins is wrong; that contention also has been put forward.) It may
be urged that his acquaintance with the technicalities of other crafts
and callings, notably of marine and military affairs, was also
extraordinary, and yet no one has suspected him of being a sailor or a
soldier. (Wrong again. Why, even Messrs. Garnett and Gosse “suspect“
that he was a soldier!) This may be conceded, but the concession hardly
furnishes an analogy. To these and all other subjects he recurs
occasionally, and in season, but with reminiscences of the law his
memory, as is abundantly clear, was simply saturated. In season and out
of season now in manifest, now in recondite application, he presses it
into the service of expression and illustration. At least a third of his
myriad metaphors are derived from it. It would indeed be difficult to
find a single act in any of his dramas, nay, in some of them, a single
scene, the diction and imagery of which are not colored by it. Much of
his law may have been acquired from three books easily accessible to
him–namely, Tottell’s PRECEDENTS (1572), Pulton’s STATUTES (1578), and
Fraunce’s LAWIER’S LOGIKE (1588), works with which he certainly seems to
have been familiar; but much of it could only have come from one who had
an intimate acquaintance with legal proceedings. We quite agree with
Mr. Castle that Shakespeare’s legal knowledge is not what could have
been picked up in an attorney’s office, but could only have been learned
by an actual attendance at the Courts, at a Pleader’s Chambers, and on
circuit, or by associating intimately with members of the Bench and
Bar.“</p>
<p>This is excellent. But what is Mr. Collins’s explanation? “Perhaps
the simplest solution of the problem is to accept the hypothesis that in
early life he was in an attorney’s office (!), that he there contracted
a love for the law which never left him, that as a young man in London
he continued to study or dabble in it for his amusement, to stroll in
leisure hours into the Courts, and to frequent the society of lawyers.
On no other supposition is it possible to explain the attraction which
the law evidently had for him, and his minute and undeviating accuracy
in a subject where no layman who has indulged in such copious and
ostentatious display of legal technicalities has ever yet succeeded in
keeping himself from tripping.“</p>
<p>A lame conclusion. “No other supposition“ indeed! Yes, there is
another, and a very obvious supposition–namely, that Shakespeare was
himself a lawyer, well versed in his trade, versed in all the ways of
the courts, and living in close intimacy with judges and members of the
Inns of Court.</p>
<p>One is, of course, thankful that Mr. Collins has appreciated the fact
that Shakespeare must have had a sound legal training, but I may be
forgiven if I do not attach quite so much importance to his
pronouncements on this branch of the subject as to those of Malone, Lord
Campbell, Judge Holmes, Mr. Castle, K.C., Lord Penzance, Mr. Grant
White, and other lawyers, who have expressed their opinion on the matter
of Shakespeare’s legal acquirements. . . .</p>
<p>Here it may, perhaps, be worth while to quote again from Lord
Penzance’s book as to the suggestion that Shakespeare had somehow or
other managed “to acquire a perfect familiarity with legal principles,
and an accurate and ready use of the technical terms and phrases, not
only of the conveyancer’s office, but of the pleader’s chambers and the
Courts at Westminster.“ This, as Lord Penzance points out, “would
require nothing short of employment in some career involving CONSTANT
CONTACT with legal questions and general legal work.“ But “in what
portion of Shakespeare’s career would it be possible to point out that
time could be found for the interposition of a legal employment in the
chambers or offices of practicing lawyers? . . . It is beyond doubt that
at an early period he was called upon to abandon his attendance at
school and assist his father, and was soon after, at the age of sixteen,
bound apprentice to a trade. While under the obligation of this bond he
could not have pursued any other employment. Then he leaves Stratford
and comes to London. He has to provide himself with the means of a
livelihood, and this he did in some capacity at the theater. No one
doubts that. The holding of horses is scouted by many, and perhaps with
justice, as being unlikely and certainly unproved; but whatever the
nature of his employment was at the theater, there is hardly room for
the belief that it could have been other than continuous, for his
progress there was so rapid. Ere long he had been taken into the company
as an actor, and was soon spoken of as a ‘Johannes Factotum.’ His rapid
accumulation of wealth speaks volumes for the constancy and activity of
his services. One fails to see when there could be a break in the
current of his life at this period of it, giving room or opportunity for
legal or indeed any other employment. ‘In 1589,’ says Knight, ‘we have
undeniable evidence that he had not only a casual engagement, was not
only a salaried servant, as may players were, but was a shareholder in
the company of the Queen’s players with other shareholders below him on
the list.’ This (1589) would be within two years after his arrival in
London, which is placed by White and Halliwell-Phillipps about the year
1587. The difficulty in supposing that, starting with a state of
ignorance in 1587, when he is supposed to have come to London, he was
induced to enter upon a course of most extended study and mental
culture, is almost insuperable. Still it was physically possible,
provided always that he could have had access to the needful books. But
this legal training seems to me to stand on a different footing. It is
not only unaccountable and incredible, but it is actually negatived by
the known facts of his career.“ Lord Penzance then refers to the fact
that “by 1592 (according to the best authority, Mr. Grant White) several
of the plays had been written. ‘The Comedy of Errors’ in 1589, ‘Love’s
Labour’s Lost’ in 1589, ‘Two Gentlemen of Verona’ in 1589 or 1590,“ and
so forth, and then asks, “with this catalogue of dramatic work on hand .
. . was it possible that he could have taken a leading part in the
management and conduct of two theaters, and if Mr. Phillipps is to be
relied upon, taken his share in the performances of the provincial tours
of his company–and at the same time devoted himself to the study of the
law in all its branches so efficiently as to make himself complete
master of its principles and practice, and saturate his mind with all
its most technical terms?“</p>
<p>I have cited this passage from Lord Penzance’s book, because it lay
before me, and I had already quoted from it on the matter of
Shakespeare’s legal knowledge; but other writers have still better set
forth the insuperable difficulties, as they seem to me, which beset the
idea that Shakespeare might have found them in some unknown period of
early life, amid multifarious other occupations, for the study of
classics, literature, and law, to say nothing of languages and a few
other matters. Lord Penzance further asks his readers: “Did you ever
meet with or hear of an instance in which a young man in this country
gave himself up to legal studies and engaged in legal employments, which
is the only way of becoming familiar with the technicalities of
practice, unless with the view of practicing in that profession? I do
not believe that it would be easy, or indeed possible, to produce an
instance in which the law has been seriously studied in all its
branches, except as a qualification for practice in the legal
profession.“</p>
<p>This testimony is so strong, so direct, so authoritative; and so
uncheapened, unwatered by guesses, and surmises, and maybe-so’s, and
might-have-beens, and could-have-beens, and must-have-beens, and the
rest of that ton of plaster of Paris out of which the biographers have
built the colossal brontosaur which goes by the Stratford actor’s name,
that it quite convinces me that the man who wrote Shakespeare’s Works
knew all about law and lawyers. Also, that that man could not have been
the Stratford Shakespeare–and WASN’T.</p>
<p>Who did write these Works, then?</p>
<p>I wish I knew.</p>
<p>—– 1. From Chapter XIII of THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM RESTATED. By
George G. Greenwood, M.P. John Lane Company, publishers.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>XDid Francis Bacon write Shakespeare’s Works? Nobody knows.</p>
<p>We cannot say we KNOW a thing when that thing has not been proved.
KNOW is too strong a word to use when the evidence is not final and
absolutely conclusive. We can infer, if we want to, like those slaves. .
. . No, I will not write that word, it is not kind, it is not courteous.
The upholders of the Stratford-Shakespeare superstition call US the
hardest names they can think of, and they keep doing it all the time;
very well, if they like to descend to that level, let them do it, but I
will not so undignify myself as to follow them. I cannot call them harsh
names; the most I can do is to indicate them by terms reflecting my
disapproval; and this without malice, without venom.</p>
<p>To resume. What I was about to say was, those thugs have built their
entire superstition upon INFERENCES, not upon known and established
facts. It is a weak method, and poor, and I am glad to be able to say
our side never resorts to it while there is anything else to resort
to.</p>
<p>But when we must, we must; and we have now arrived at a place of that
sort. . . . Since the Stratford Shakespeare couldn’t have written the
Works, we infer that somebody did. Who was it, then? This requires some
more inferring.</p>
<p>Ordinarily when an unsigned poem sweeps across the continent like a
tidal wave whose roar and boom and thunder are made up of admiration,
delight, and applause, a dozen obscure people rise up and claim the
authorship. Why a dozen, instead of only one or two? One reason is,
because there are a dozen that are recognizably competent to do that
poem. Do you remember “Beautiful Snow“? Do you remember “Rock Me to
Sleep, Mother, Rock Me to Sleep“? Do you remember “Backward, turn,
backward, O Time, in thy flight! Make me a child again just for
tonight“? I remember them very well. Their authorship was claimed by
most of the grown-up people who were alive at the time, and every
claimant had one plausible argument in his favor, at least–to wit, he
could have done the authoring; he was competent.</p>
<p>Have the Works been claimed by a dozen? They haven’t. There was good
reason. The world knows there was but one man on the planet at the time
who was competent–not a dozen, and not two. A long time ago the dwellers
in a far country used now and then to find a procession of prodigious
footprints stretching across the plain–footprints that were three miles
apart, each footprint a third of a mile long and a furlong deep, and
with forests and villages mashed to mush in it. Was there any doubt as
to who made that mighty trail? Were there a dozen claimants? Where there
two? No–the people knew who it was that had been along there: there was
only one Hercules.</p>
<p>There has been only one Shakespeare. There couldn’t be two; certainly
there couldn’t be two at the same time. It takes ages to bring forth a
Shakespeare, and some more ages to match him. This one was not matched
before his time; nor during his time; and hasn’t been matched since. The
prospect of matching him in our time is not bright.</p>
<p>The Baconians claim that the Stratford Shakespeare was not qualified
to write the Works, and that Francis Bacon was. They claim that Bacon
possessed the stupendous equipment–both natural and acquired–for the
miracle; and that no other Englishman of his day possessed the like; or,
indeed, anything closely approaching it.</p>
<p>Macaulay, in his Essay, has much to say about the splendor and
horizonless magnitude of that equipment. Also, he has synopsized Bacon’s
history–a thing which cannot be done for the Stratford Shakespeare, for
he hasn’t any history to synopsize. Bacon’s history is open to the
world, from his boyhood to his death in old age–a history consisting of
known facts, displayed in minute and multitudinous detail; FACTS, not
guesses and conjectures and might-have-beens.</p>
<p>Whereby it appears that he was born of a race of statesmen, and had a
Lord Chancellor for his father, and a mother who was “distinguished both
as a linguist and a theologian: she corresponded in Greek with Bishop
Jewell, and translated his APOLOGIA from the Latin so correctly that
neither he nor Archbishop Parker could suggest a single alteration.“ It
is the atmosphere we are reared in that determines how our inclinations
and aspirations shall tend. The atmosphere furnished by the parents to
the son in this present case was an atmosphere saturated with learning;
with thinkings and ponderings upon deep subjects; and with polite
culture. It had its natural effect. Shakespeare of Stratford was reared
in a house which had no use for books, since its owners, his parents,
were without education. This may have had an effect upon the son, but we
do not know, because we have no history of him of an informing sort.
There were but few books anywhere, in that day, and only the well-to-do
and highly educated possessed them, they being almost confined to the
dead languages. “All the valuable books then extant in all the
vernacular dialects of Europe would hardly have filled a single
shelf“–imagine it! The few existing books were in the Latin tongue
mainly. “A person who was ignorant of it was shut out from all
acquaintance–not merely with Cicero and Virgil, but with the most
interesting memoirs, state papers, and pamphlets of his own time“–a
literature necessary to the Stratford lad, for his fictitious
reputation’s sake, since the writer of his Works would begin to use it
wholesale and in a most masterly way before the lad was hardly more than
out of his teens and into his twenties.</p>
<p>At fifteen Bacon was sent to the university, and he spent three years
there. Thence he went to Paris in the train of the English Ambassador,
and there he mingled daily with the wise, the cultured, the great, and
the aristocracy of fashion, during another three years. A total of six
years spent at the sources of knowledge; knowledge both of books and of
men. The three spent at the university were coeval with the second and
last three spent by the little Stratford lad at Stratford school
supposedly, and perhapsedly, and maybe, and by inference–with nothing to
infer from. The second three of the Baconian six were “presumably“ spent
by the Stratford lad as apprentice to a butcher. That is, the thugs
presume it–on no evidence of any kind. Which is their way, when they
want a historical fact. Fact and presumption are, for business purposes,
all the same to them. They know the difference, but they also know how
to blink it. They know, too, that while in history-building a fact is
better than a presumption, it doesn’t take a presumption long to bloom
into a fact when THEY have the handling of it. They know by old
experience that when they get hold of a presumption-tadpole he is not
going to STAY tadpole in their history-tank; no, they know how to
develop him into the giant four-legged bullfrog of FACT, and make him
sit up on his hams, and puff out his chin, and look important and
insolent and come-to-stay; and assert his genuine simon-pure
authenticity with a thundering bellow that will convince everybody
because it is so loud. The thug is aware that loudness convinces sixty
persons where reasoning convinces but one. I wouldn’t be a thug, not
even if–but never mind about that, it has nothing to do with the
argument, and it is not noble in spirit besides. If I am better than a
thug, is the merit mine? No, it is His. Then to Him be the praise. That
is the right spirit.</p>
<p>They “presume“ the lad severed his “presumed“ connection with the
Stratford school to become apprentice to a butcher. They also “presume“
that the butcher was his father. They don’t know. There is no written
record of it, nor any other actual evidence. If it would have helped
their case any, they would have apprenticed him to thirty butchers, to
fifty butchers, to a wilderness of butchers–all by their patented method
“presumption.“ If it will help their case they will do it yet; and if it
will further help it, they will “presume“ that all those butchers were
his father. And the week after, they will SAY it. Why, it is just like
being the past tense of the compound reflexive adverbial incandescent
hypodermic irregular accusative Noun of Multitude; which is father to
the expression which the grammarians call Verb. It is like a whole
ancestry, with only one posterity.</p>
<p>To resume. Next, the young Bacon took up the study of law, and
mastered that abstruse science. From that day to the end of his life he
was daily in close contact with lawyers and judges; not as a casual
onlooker in intervals between holding horses in front of a theater, but
as a practicing lawyer–a great and successful one, a renowned one, a
Launcelot of the bar, the most formidable lance in the high brotherhood
of the legal Table Round; he lived in the law’s atmosphere thenceforth,
all his years, and by sheer ability forced his way up its difficult
steeps to its supremest summit, the Lord-Chancellorship, leaving behind
him no fellow-craftsman qualified to challenge his divine right to that
majestic place.</p>
<p>When we read the praises bestowed by Lord Penzance and the other
illustrious experts upon the legal condition and legal aptnesses,
brilliances, profundities, and felicities so prodigally displayed in the
Plays, and try to fit them to the historyless Stratford stage-manager,
they sound wild, strange, incredible, ludicrous; but when we put them in
the mouth of Bacon they do not sound strange, they seem in their natural
and rightful place, they seem at home there. Please turn back and read
them again. Attributed to Shakespeare of Stratford they are meaningless,
they are inebriate extravagancies–intemperate admirations of the dark
side of the moon, so to speak; attributed to Bacon, they are admirations
of the golden glories of the moon’s front side, the moon at the full–and
not intemperate, not overwrought, but sane and right, and justified. “At
ever turn and point at which the author required a metaphor, simile, or
illustration, his mind ever turned FIRST to the law; he seems almost to
have THOUGHT in legal phrases; the commonest legal phrases, the
commonest of legal expressions, were ever at the end of his pen.“ That
could happen to no one but a person whose TRADE was the law; it could
not happen to a dabbler in it. Veteran mariners fill their conversation
with sailor-phrases and draw all their similes from the ship and the sea
and the storm, but no mere PASSENGER ever does it, be he of Stratford or
elsewhere; or could do it with anything resembling accuracy, if he were
hardy enough to try. Please read again what Lord Campbell and the other
great authorities have said about Bacon when they thought they were
saying it about Shakespeare of Stratford.</p>
<p>XThe Rest of the Equipment</p>
<p>The author of the Plays was equipped, beyond every other man of his
time, with wisdom, erudition, imagination, capaciousness of mind, grace,
and majesty of expression. Everyone one had said it, no one doubts it.
Also, he had humor, humor in rich abundance, and always wanting to break
out. We have no evidence of any kind that Shakespeare of Stratford
possessed any of these gifts or any of these acquirements. The only
lines he ever wrote, so far as we know, are substantially barren of them
–barren of all of them.</p>
<p>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare:
Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my
bones.</p>
<p>Ben Jonson says of Bacon, as orator:</p>
<p>His language, WHERE HE COULD SPARE AND PASS BY A JEST, was nobly
censorious. No man ever spoke more neatly, more pressly, more weightily,
or suffered less emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered. No member
of his speech but consisted of his (its) own graces. . . . The fear of
every man that heard him was lest he should make an end.</p>
<p>From Macaulay:</p>
<p>He continued to distinguish himself in Parliament, particularly by
his exertions in favor of one excellent measure on which the King’s
heart was set–the union of England and Scotland. It was not difficult
for such an intellect to discover many irresistible arguments in favor
of such a scheme. He conducted the great case of the POST NATI in the
Exchequer Chamber; and the decision of the judges–a decision the
legality of which may be questioned, but the beneficial effect of which
must be acknowledged–was in a great measure attributed to his dexterous
management.</p>
<p>Again:</p>
<p>While actively engaged in the House of Commons and in the courts of
law, he still found leisure for letters and philosophy. The noble
treatise on the ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING, which at a later period was
expanded into the DE AUGMENTIS, appeared in 1605.</p>
<p>The WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS, a work which, if it had proceeded from
any other writer, would have been considered as a masterpiece of wit and
learning, was printed in 1609.</p>
<p>In the mean time the NOVUM ORGANUM was slowly proceeding. Several
distinguished men of learning had been permitted to see portions of that
extraordinary book, and they spoke with the greatest admiration of his
genius.</p>
<p>Even Sir Thomas Bodley, after perusing the COGITATA ET VISA, one of
the most precious of those scattered leaves out of which the great
oracular volume was afterward made up, acknowledged that “in all
proposals and plots in that book, Bacon showed himself a master
workman“; and that “it could not be gainsaid but all the treatise over
did abound with choice conceits of the present state of learning, and
with worthy contemplations of the means to procure it.“</p>
<p>In 1612 a new edition of the ESSAYS appeared, with additions
surpassing the original collection both in bulk and quality.</p>
<p>Nor did these pursuits distract Bacon’s attention from a work the
most arduous, the most glorious, and the most useful that even his
mighty powers could have achieved, “the reducing and recompiling,“ to
use his own phrase, “of the laws of England.“</p>
<p>To serve the exacting and laborious offices of Attorney-General and
Solicitor-General would have satisfied the appetite of any other man for
hard work, but Bacon had to add the vast literary industries just
described, to satisfy his. He was a born worker.</p>
<p>The service which he rendered to letters during the last five years
of his life, amid ten thousand distractions and vexations, increase the
regret with which we think on the many years which he had wasted, to use
the words of Sir Thomas Bodley, “on such study as was not worthy such a
student.“</p>
<p>He commenced a digest of the laws of England, a History of England
under the Princes of the House of Tudor, a body of National History, a
Philosophical Romance. He made extensive and valuable additions to his
Essays. He published the inestimable TREATISE DE AUGMENTIS
SCIENTIARUM.</p>
<p>Did these labors of Hercules fill up his time to his contentment, and
quiet his appetite for work? Not entirely:</p>
<p>The trifles with which he amused himself in hours of pain and languor
bore the mark of his mind. THE BEST JEST-BOOK IN THE WORLD is that which
he dictated from memory, without referring to any book, on a day on
which illness had rendered him incapable of serious study.</p>
<p>Here are some scattered remarks (from Macaulay) which throw light
upon Bacon, and seem to indicate–and maybe demonstrate–that he was
competent to write the Plays and Poems:</p>
<p>With great minuteness of observation he had an amplitude of
comprehension such as has never yet been vouchsafed to any other human
being.</p>
<p>The ESSAYS contain abundant proofs that no nice feature of character,
no peculiarity in the ordering of a house, a garden, or a court-masque,
could escape the notice of one whose mind was capable of taking in the
whole world of knowledge.</p>
<p>His understanding resembled the tent which the fairy Paribanou gave
to Prince Ahmed: fold it, and it seemed a toy for the hand of a lady;
spread it, and the armies of the powerful Sultans might repose beneath
its shade.</p>
<p>The knowledge in which Bacon excelled all men was a knowledge of the
mutual relations of all departments of knowledge.</p>
<p>In a letter written when he was only thirty-one, to his uncle, Lord
Burleigh, he said, “I have taken all knowledge to be my province.“</p>
<p>Though Bacon did not arm his philosophy with the weapons of logic, he
adorned her profusely with all the richest decorations of rhetoric.</p>
<p>The practical faculty was powerful in Bacon; but not, like his wit,
so powerful as occasionally to usurp the place of his reason and to
tyrannize over the whole man.</p>
<p>There are too many places in the Plays where this happens. Poor old
dying John of Gaunt volleying second-rate puns at his own name, is a
pathetic instance of it. “We may assume“ that it is Bacon’s fault, but
the Stratford Shakespeare has to bear the blame.</p>
<p>No imagination was ever at once so strong and so thoroughly
subjugated. It stopped at the first check from good sense.</p>
<p>In truth, much of Bacon’s life was passed in a visionary world–amid
things as strange as any that are described in the ARABIAN TALES . . .
amid buildings more sumptuous than the palace of Aladdin, fountains more
wonderful than the golden water of Parizade, conveyances more rapid than
the hippogryph of Ruggiero, arms more formidable than the lance of
Astolfo, remedies more efficacious than the balsam of Fierabras. Yet in
his magnificent day-dreams there was nothing wild–nothing but what sober
reason sanctioned.</p>
<p>Bacon’s greatest performance is the first book of the NOVUM ORGANUM.
. . . Every part of it blazes with wit, but with wit which is employed
only to illustrate and decorate truth. No book ever made so great a
revolution in the mode of thinking, overthrew so may prejudices,
introduced so many new opinions.</p>
<p>But what we most admire is the vast capacity of that intellect which,
without effort, takes in at once all the domains of science–all the
past, the present and the future, all the errors of two thousand years,
all the encouraging signs of the passing times, all the bright hopes of
the coming age.</p>
<p>He had a wonderful talent for packing thought close and rendering it
portable.</p>
<p>His eloquence would alone have entitled him to a high rank in
literature.</p>
<p>It is evident that he had each and every one of the mental gifts and
each and every one of the acquirements that are so prodigally displayed
in the Plays and Poems, and in much higher and richer degree than any
other man of his time or of any previous time. He was a genius without a
mate, a prodigy not matable. There was only one of him; the planet could
not produce two of him at one birth, nor in one age. He could have
written anything that is in the Plays and Poems. He could have written
this:</p>
<p>The cloud-cap’d towers, the gorgeous palaces, The solemn temples, the
great globe itself, Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, And, like
an insubstantial pageant faded, Leave not a rack behind. We are such
stuff As dreams are made of, and our little life Is rounded with a
sleep.</p>
<p>Also, he could have written this, but he refrained:</p>
<p>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare To digg the dust encloased heare:
Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones And curst be he yt moves my
bones.</p>
<p>When a person reads the noble verses about the cloud-cap’d towers, he
ought not to follow it immediately with Good friend for Iesus sake
forbeare, because he will find the transition from great poetry to poor
prose too violent for comfort. It will give him a shock. You never
notice how commonplace and unpoetic gravel is until you bite into a
layer of it in a pie.</p>
<p>XI</p>
<p>Am I trying to convince anybody that Shakespeare did not write
Shakespeare’s Works? Ah, now, what do you take me for? Would I be so
soft as that, after having known the human race familiarly for nearly
seventy-four years? It would grieve me to know that any one could think
so injuriously of me, so uncomplimentarily, so unadmiringly of me. No,
no, I am aware that when even the brightest mind in our world has been
trained up from childhood in a superstition of any kind, it will never
be possible for that mind, in its maturity, to examine sincerely,
dispassionately, and conscientiously any evidence or any circumstance
which shall seem to cast a doubt upon the validity of that superstition.
I doubt if I could do it myself. We always get at second hand our
notions about systems of government; and high tariff and low tariff; and
prohibition and anti-prohibition; and the holiness of peace and the
glories of war; and codes of honor and codes of morals; and approval of
the duel and disapproval of it; and our beliefs concerning the nature of
cats; and our ideas as to whether the murder of helpless wild animals is
base or is heroic; and our preferences in the matter of religious and
political parties; and our acceptance or rejection of the Shakespeares
and the Author Ortons and the Mrs. Eddys. We get them all at second
hand, we reason none of them out for ourselves. It is the way we are
made. It is the way we are all made, and we can’t help it, we can’t
change it. And whenever we have been furnished a fetish, and have been
taught to believe in it, and love it and worship it, and refrain from
examining it, there is no evidence, howsoever clear and strong, that can
persuade us to withdraw from it our loyalty and our devotion. In morals,
conduct, and beliefs we take the color of our environment and
associations, and it is a color that can safely be warranted to wash.
Whenever we have been furnished with a tar baby ostensibly stuffed with
jewels, and warned that it will be dishonorable and irreverent to
disembowel it and test the jewels, we keep our sacrilegious hands off
it. We submit, not reluctantly, but rather gladly, for we are privately
afraid we should find, upon examination that the jewels are of the sort
that are manufactured at North Adams, Mass.</p>
<p>I haven’t any idea that Shakespeare will have to vacate his pedestal
this side of the year 2209. Disbelief in him cannot come swiftly,
disbelief in a healthy and deeply-loved tar baby has never been known to
disintegrate swiftly; it is a very slow process. It took several
thousand years to convince our fine race–including every splendid
intellect in it–that there is no such thing as a witch; it has taken
several thousand years to convince the same fine race–including every
splendid intellect in it–that there is no such person as Satan; it has
taken several centuries to remove perdition from the Protestant Church’s
program of post-mortem entertainments; it has taken a weary long time to
persuade American Presbyterians to give up infant damnation and try to
bear it the best they can; and it looks as if their Scotch brethren will
still be burning babies in the everlasting fires when Shakespeare comes
down from his perch.</p>
<p>We are The Reasoning Race. We can’t prove it by the above examples,
and we can’t prove it by the miraculous “histories“ built by those
Stratfordolaters out of a hatful of rags and a barrel of sawdust, but
there is a plenty of other things we can prove it by, if I could think
of them. We are The Reasoning Race, and when we find a vague file of
chipmunk-tracks stringing through the dust of Stratford village, we know
by our reasoning bowers that Hercules has been along there. I feel that
our fetish is safe for three centuries yet. The bust, too–there in the
Stratford Church. The precious bust, the priceless bust, the calm bust,
the serene bust, the emotionless bust, with the dandy mustache, and the
putty face, unseamed of care–that face which has looked passionlessly
down upon the awed pilgrim for a hundred and fifty years and will still
look down upon the awed pilgrim three hundred more, with the deep, deep,
deep, subtle, subtle, subtle expression of a bladder.</p>
<p>XII</p>
<p>Irreverence</p>
<p>One of the most trying defects which I find in these–these–what shall
I call them? for I will not apply injurious epithets to them, the way
they do to us, such violations of courtesy being repugnant to my nature
and my dignity. The farthest I can go in that direction is to call them
by names of limited reverence–names merely descriptive, never unkind,
never offensive, never tainted by harsh feeling. If THEY would do like
this, they would feel better in their hearts. Very well, then–to
proceed. One of the most trying defects which I find in these
Stratfordolaters, these Shakesperiods, these thugs, these bangalores,
these troglodytes, these herumfrodites, these blatherskites, these
buccaneers, these bandoleers, is their spirit of irreverence. It is
detectable in every utterance of theirs when they are talking about us.
I am thankful that in me there is nothing of that spirit. When a thing
is sacred to me it is impossible for me to be irreverent toward it. I
cannot call to mind a single instance where I have ever been irreverent,
except towards the things which were sacred to other people. Am I in the
right? I think so. But I ask no one to take my unsupported word; no,
look at the dictionary; let the dictionary decide. Here is the
definition:</p>
<p>IRREVERENCE. The quality or condition of irreverence toward God and
sacred things.</p>
<p>What does the Hindu say? He says it is correct. He says irreverence
is lack of respect for Vishnu, and Brahma, and Chrishna, and his other
gods, and for his sacred cattle, and for his temples and the things
within them. He endorses the definition, you see; and there are
300,000,000 Hindus or their equivalents back of him.</p>
<p>The dictionary had the acute idea that by using the capital G it
could restrict irreverence to lack of reverence for OUR Deity and our
sacred things, but that ingenious and rather sly idea miscarried: for by
the simple process of spelling HIS deities with capitals the Hindu
confiscates the definition and restricts it to his own sects, thus
making it clearly compulsory upon us to revere HIS gods and HIS sacred
things, and nobody’s else. We can’t say a word, for he had our own
dictionary at his back, and its decision is final.</p>
<p>This law, reduced to its simplest terms, is this: 1. Whatever is
sacred to the Christian must be held in reverence by everybody else; 2.
whatever is sacred to the Hindu must be held in reverence by everybody
else; 3. therefore, by consequence, logically, and indisputably,
whatever is sacred to ME must be held in reverence by everybody
else.</p>
<p>Now then, what aggravates me is that these troglodytes and muscovites
and bandoleers and buccaneers are ALSO trying to crowd in and share the
benefit of the law, and compel everybody to revere their Shakespeare and
hold him sacred. We can’t have that: there’s enough of us already. If
you go on widening and spreading and inflating the privilege, it will
presently come to be conceded that each man’s sacred things are the ONLY
ones, and the rest of the human race will have to be humbly reverent
toward them or suffer for it. That can surely happen, and when it
happens, the word Irreverence will be regarded as the most meaningless,
and foolish, and self-conceited, and insolent, and impudent, and
dictatorial word in the language. And people will say, “Whose business
is it what gods I worship and what things hold sacred? Who has the right
to dictate to my conscience, and where did he get that right?“</p>
<p>We cannot afford to let that calamity come upon us. We must save the
word from this destruction. There is but one way to do it, and that is
to stop the spread of the privilege and strictly confine it to its
present limits–that is, to all the Christian sects, to all the Hindu
sects, and me. We do not need any more, the stock is watered enough,
just as it is.</p>
<p>It would be better if the privilege were limited to me alone. I think
so because I am the only sect that knows how to employ it gently,
kindly, charitably, dispassionately. The other sects lack the quality of
self-restraint. The Catholic Church says the most irreverent things
about matters which are sacred to the Protestants, and the Protestant
Church retorts in kind about the confessional and other matters which
Catholics hold sacred; then both of these irreverencers turn upon Thomas
Paine and charge HIM with irreverence. This is all unfortunate, because
it makes it difficult for students equipped with only a low grade of
mentality to find out what Irreverence really IS.</p>
<p>It will surely be much better all around if the privilege of
regulating the irreverent and keeping them in order shall eventually be
withdrawn from all the sects but me. Then there will be no more
quarreling, no more bandying of disrespectful epithets, no more
heartburnings.</p>
<p>There will then be nothing sacred involved in this Bacon-Shakespeare
controversy except what is sacred to me. That will simplify the whole
matter, and trouble will cease. There will be irreverence no longer,
because I will not allow it. The first time those criminals charge me
with irreverence for calling their Stratford myth an
Arthur-Orton-Mary-Baker-Thompson-Eddy-Louis-the-Seventeenth-Veiled-
Prophet-of-Khorassan will be the last. Taught by the methods found
effective in extinguishing earlier offenders by the Inquisition, of holy
memory, I shall know how to quiet them.</p>

<p>Isn’t it odd, when you think of it, that you may list all the
celebrated Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen of modern times, clear
back to the first Tudors–a list containing five hundred names, shall we
say?–and you can go to the histories, biographies, and cyclopedias and
learn the particulars of the lives of every one of them. Every one of
them except one–the most famous, the most renowned–by far the most
illustrious of them all–Shakespeare! You can get the details of the
lives of all the celebrated ecclesiastics in the list; all the
celebrated tragedians, comedians, singers, dancers, orators, judges,
lawyers, poets, dramatists, historians, biographers, editors, inventors,
reformers, statesmen, generals, admirals, discoverers, prize-fighters,
murderers, pirates, conspirators, horse-jockeys, bunco-steerers, misers,
swindlers, explorers, adventurers by land and sea, bankers, financiers,
astronomers, naturalists, claimants, impostors, chemists, biologists,
geologists, philologists, college presidents and professors, architects,
engineers, painters, sculptors, politicians, agitators, rebels,
revolutionists, patriots, demagogues, clowns, cooks, freaks,
philosophers, burglars, highwaymen, journalists, physicians,
surgeons–you can get the life-histories of all of them but ONE. Just
ONE–the most extraordinary and the most celebrated of them
all–Shakespeare!</p>
<p>You may add to the list the thousand celebrated persons furnished by
the rest of Christendom in the past four centuries, and you can find out
the life-histories of all those people, too. You will then have listed
fifteen hundred celebrities, and you can trace the authentic
life-histories of the whole of them. Save one–far and away the most
colossal prodigy of the entire accumulation–Shakespeare! About him you
can find out NOTHING. Nothing of even the slightest importance. Nothing
worth the trouble of stowing away in your memory. Nothing that even
remotely indicates that he was ever anything more than a distinctly
commonplace person–a manager, an actor of inferior grade, a small trader
in a small village that did not regard him as a person of any
consequence, and had forgotten all about him before he was fairly cold
in his grave. We can go to the records and find out the life-history of
every renowned RACE-HORSE of modern times–but not Shakespeare’s! There
are many reasons why, and they have been furnished in cart-loads (of
guess and conjecture) by those troglodytes; but there is one that is
worth all the rest of the reasons put together, and is abundantly
sufficient all by itself–HE HADN’T ANY HISTORY TO RECORD. There is no
way of getting around that deadly fact. And no sane way has yet been
discovered of getting around its formidable significance.</p>
<p>Its quite plain significance–to any but those thugs (I do not use the
term unkindly) is, that Shakespeare had no prominence while he lived,
and none until he had been dead two or three generations. The Plays
enjoyed high fame from the beginning; and if he wrote them it seems a
pity the world did not find it out. He ought to have explained that he
was the author, and not merely a NOM DE PLUME for another man to hide
behind. If he had been less intemperately solicitous about his bones,
and more solicitous about his Works, it would have been better for his
good name, and a kindness to us. The bones were not important. They will
moulder away, they will turn to dust, but the Works will endure until
the last sun goes down.</p>
<p>Mark Twain.</p>
<p>P.S. MARCH 25. About two months ago I was illuminating this
Autobiography with some notions of mine concerning the Bacon-Shakespeare
controversy, and I then took occasion to air the opinion that the
Stratford Shakespeare was a person of no public consequence or celebrity
during his lifetime, but was utterly obscure and unimportant. And not
only in great London, but also in the little village where he was born,
where he lived a quarter of a century, and where he died and was buried.
I argued that if he had been a person of any note at all, aged villagers
would have had much to tell about him many and many a year after his
death, instead of being unable to furnish inquirers a single fact
connected with him. I believed, and I still believe, that if he had been
famous, his notoriety would have lasted as long as mine has lasted in my
native village out in Missouri. It is a good argument, a prodigiously
strong one, and most formidable one for even the most gifted and
ingenious and plausible Stratfordolator to get around or explain away.
Today a Hannibal COURIER-POST of recent date has reached me, with an
article in it which reinforces my contention that a really celebrated
person cannot be forgotten in his village in the short space of sixty
years. I will make an extract from it:</p>
<p>Hannibal, as a city, may have many sins to answer for, but
ingratitude is not one of them, or reverence for the great men she has
produced, and as the years go by her greatest son, Mark Twain, or S. L.
Clemens as a few of the unlettered call him, grows in the estimation and
regard of the residents of the town he made famous and the town that
made him famous. His name is associated with every old building that is
torn down to make way for the modern structures demanded by a rapidly
growing city, and with every hill or cave over or through which he might
by any possibility have roamed, while the many points of interest which
he wove into his stories, such as Holiday Hill, Jackson’s Island, or
Mark Twain Cave, are now monuments to his genius. Hannibal is glad of
any opportunity to do him honor as he had honored her.</p>
<p>So it has happened that the “old timers“ who went to school with Mark
or were with him on some of his usual escapades have been honored with
large audiences whenever they were in a reminiscent mood and
condescended to tell of their intimacy with the ordinary boy who came to
be a very extraordinary humorist and whose every boyish act is now seen
to have been indicative of what was to come. Like Aunt Becky and
Mrs. Clemens, they can now see that Mark was hardly appreciated when he
lived here and that the things he did as a boy and was whipped for doing
were not all bad, after all. So they have been in no hesitancy about
drawing out the bad things he did as well as the good in their efforts
to get a “Mark Twain“ story, all incidents being viewed in the light of
his present fame, until the volume of “Twainiana“ is already
considerable and growing in proportion as the “old timers“ drop away and
the stories are retold second and third hand by their descendants. With
some seventy-three years and living in a villa instead of a house, he is
a fair target, and let him incorporate, copyright, or patent himself as
he will, there are some of his “works“ that will go swooping up Hannibal
chimneys as long as graybeards gather about the fires and begin with,
“I’ve heard father tell,“ or possibly, “Once when I.“ The Mrs. Clemens
referred to is my mother–WAS my mother.</p>
<p>And here is another extract from a Hannibal paper, of date twenty
days ago:</p>
<p>Miss Becca Blankenship died at the home of William Dickason, 408 Rock
Street, at 2.30 o’clock yesterday afternoon, aged 72 years. The deceased
was a sister of “Huckleberry Finn,“ one of the famous characters in Mark
Twain’s TOM SAWYER. She had been a member of the Dickason family–the
housekeeper–for nearly forty-five years, and was a highly respected
lady. For the past eight years she had been an invalid, but was as well
cared for by Mr. Dickason and his family as if she had been a near
relative. She was a member of the Park Methodist Church and a Christian
woman.</p>
<p>I remember her well. I have a picture of her in my mind which was
graven there, clear and sharp and vivid, sixty-three years ago. She was
at that time nine years old, and I was about eleven. I remember where
she stood, and how she looked; and I can still see her bare feet, her
bare head, her brown face, and her short tow-linen frock. She was
crying. What it was about I have long ago forgotten. But it was the
tears that preserved the picture for me, no doubt. She was a good child,
I can say that for her. She knew me nearly seventy years ago. Did she
forget me, in the course of time? I think not. If she had lived in
Stratford in Shakespeare’s time, would she have forgotten him? Yes. For
he was never famous during his lifetime, he was utterly obscure in
Stratford, and there wouldn’t be any occasion to remember him after he
had been dead a week.</p>
<p>“Injun Joe,“ “Jimmy Finn,“ and “General Gaines“ were prominent and
very intemperate ne’er-do-weels in Hannibal two generations ago. Plenty
of grayheads there remember them to this day, and can tell you about
them. Isn’t it curious that two “town drunkards“ and one half-breed
loafer should leave behind them, in a remote Missourian village, a fame
a hundred times greater and several hundred times more particularized in
the matter of definite facts than Shakespeare left behind him in the
village where he had lived the half of his lifetime?</p>
