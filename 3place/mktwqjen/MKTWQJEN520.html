<h4 id="chapter-xxxvii.">CHAPTER XXXVII.</h4>
<p>SIR LAUNCELOT AND KNIGHTS TO THE RESCUE</p>
<p>Nearing four in the afternoon. The scene was just outside the walls
of London. A cool, comfortable, superb day, with a brilliant sun; the
kind of day to make one want to live, not die. The multitude was
prodigious and far-reaching; and yet we fifteen poor devils hadn’t a
friend in it. There was something painful in that thought, look at it
how you might. There we sat, on our tall scaffold, the butt of the hate
and mockery of all those enemies. We were being made a holiday
spectacle. They had built a sort of grand stand for the nobility and
gentry, and these were there in full force, with their ladies. We
recognized a good many of them.</p>
<p>The crowd got a brief and unexpected dash of diversion out of the
king. The moment we were freed of our bonds he sprang up, in his
fantastic rags, with face bruised out of all recognition, and proclaimed
himself Arthur, King of Britain, and denounced the awful penalties of
treason upon every soul there present if hair of his sacred head were
touched. It startled and surprised him to hear them break into a vast
roar of laughter. It wounded his dignity, and he locked himself up in
silence. Then, although the crowd begged him to go on, and tried to
provoke him to it by catcalls, jeers, and shouts of:</p>
<p>“Let him speak! The king! The king! his humble subjects hunger and
thirst for words of wisdom out of the mouth of their master his Serene
and Sacred Raggedness!“</p>
<p>But it went for nothing. He put on all his majesty and sat under this
rain of contempt and insult unmoved. He certainly was great in his way.
Absently, I had taken off my white bandage and wound it about my right
arm. When the crowd noticed this, they began upon me. They said:</p>
<p>“Doubtless this sailor-man is his minister–observe his costly badge
of office!“</p>
<p>I let them go on until they got tired, and then I said:</p>
<p>“Yes, I am his minister, The Boss; and to-morrow you will hear that
from Camelot which–“</p>
<p>I got no further. They drowned me out with joyous derision. But
presently there was silence; for the sheriffs of London, in their
official robes, with their subordinates, began to make a stir which
indicated that business was about to begin. In the hush which followed,
our crime was recited, the death warrant read, then everybody uncovered
while a priest uttered a prayer.</p>
<p>Then a slave was blindfolded; the hangman unslung his rope. There lay
the smooth road below us, we upon one side of it, the banked multitude
wailing its other side–a good clear road, and kept free by the
police–how good it would be to see my five hundred horsemen come tearing
down it! But no, it was out of the possibilities. I followed its
receding thread out into the distance–not a horseman on it, or sign of
one.</p>
<p>There was a jerk, and the slave hung dangling; dangling and hideously
squirming, for his limbs were not tied.</p>
<p>A second rope was unslung, in a moment another slave was
dangling.</p>
<p>In a minute a third slave was struggling in the air. It was dreadful.
I turned away my head a moment, and when I turned back I missed the
king! They were blindfolding him! I was paralyzed; I couldn’t move, I
was choking, my tongue was petrified. They finished blindfolding him,
they led him under the rope. I couldn’t shake off that clinging
impotence. But when I saw them put the noose around his neck, then
everything let go in me and I made a spring to the rescue–and as I made
it I shot one more glance abroad–by George! here they came,
a-tilting!–five hundred mailed and belted knights on bicycles!</p>
<p>The grandest sight that ever was seen. Lord, how the plumes streamed,
how the sun flamed and flashed from the endless procession of webby
wheels!</p>
<p>I waved my right arm as Launcelot swept in–he recognized my rag –I
tore away noose and bandage, and shouted:</p>
<p>“On your knees, every rascal of you, and salute the king! Who fails
shall sup in hell to-night!“</p>
<p>I always use that high style when I’m climaxing an effect. Well, it
was noble to see Launcelot and the boys swarm up onto that scaffold and
heave sheriffs and such overboard. And it was fine to see that
astonished multitude go down on their knees and beg their lives of the
king they had just been deriding and insulting. And as he stood apart
there, receiving this homage in rags, I thought to myself, well, really
there is something peculiarly grand about the gait and bearing of a
king, after all.</p>
<p>I was immensely satisfied. Take the whole situation all around, it
was one of the gaudiest effects I ever instigated.</p>
<p>And presently up comes Clarence, his own self! and winks, and says,
very modernly:</p>
<p>“Good deal of a surprise, wasn’t it? I knew you’d like it. I’ve had
the boys practicing this long time, privately; and just hungry for a
chance to show off.“</p>
