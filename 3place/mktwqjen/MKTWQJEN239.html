<h4 id="the-widows-protest">THE WIDOW’S PROTEST</h4>
<p>One of the saddest things that ever came under my notice (said the
banker’s clerk) was there in Corning during the war. Dan Murphy enlisted
as a private, and fought very bravely. The boys all liked him, and when
a wound by and by weakened him down till carrying a musket was too heavy
work for him, they clubbed together and fixed him up as a sutler. He
made money then, and sent it always to his wife to bank for him. She was
a washer and ironer, and knew enough by hard experience to keep money
when she got it. She didn’t waste a penny.</p>
<p>On the contrary, she began to get miserly as her bank-account grew.
She grieved to part with a cent, poor creature, for twice in her
hard-working life she had known what it was to be hungry, cold,
friendless, sick, and without a dollar in the world, and she had a
haunting dread of suffering so again. Well, at last Dan died; and the
boys, in testimony of their esteem and respect for him, telegraphed to
Mrs. Murphy to know if she would like to have him embalmed and sent
home; when you know the usual custom was to dump a poor devil like him
into a shallow hole, and then inform his friends what had become of him.
Mrs. Murphy jumped to the conclusion that it would only cost two or
three dollars to embalm her dead husband, and so she telegraphed “Yes.“
It was at the “wake“ that the bill for embalming arrived and was
presented to the widow.</p>
<p>She uttered a wild, sad wail that pierced every heart, and said,
“Sivinty-foive dollars for stooffin’ Dan, blister their sowls! Did thim
divils suppose I was goin’ to stairt a Museim, that I’d be dalin’ in
such expinsive curiassities !“</p>
<p>The banker’s clerk said there was not a dry eye in the house.</p>
<p>THE SCRIPTURAL PANORAMIST–[Written about 1866.]</p>
<p>“There was a fellow traveling around in that country,“ said
Mr. Nickerson, “with a moral-religious show–a sort of scriptural
panorama –and he hired a wooden-headed old slab to play the piano for
him. After the first night’s performance the showman says:</p>
<p>“‘My friend, you seem to know pretty much all the tunes there are,
and you worry along first rate. But then, didn’t you notice that
sometimes last night the piece you happened to be playing was a little
rough on the proprieties, so to speak–didn’t seem to jibe with the
general gait of the picture that was passing at the time, as it were–was
a little foreign to the subject, you know–as if you didn’t either trump
or follow suit, you understand?’</p>
<p>“‘Well, no,’ the fellow said; ‘he hadn’t noticed, but it might be; he
had played along just as it came handy.’</p>
<p>“So they put it up that the simple old dummy was to keep his eye on
the panorama after that, and as soon as a stunning picture was reeled
out he was to fit it to a dot with a piece of music that would help the
audience to get the idea of the subject, and warm them up like a
camp-meeting revival. That sort of thing would corral their sympathies,
the showman said.</p>
<p>“There was a big audience that night-mostly middle-aged and old
people who belong to the church, and took a strong interest in Bible
matters, and the balance were pretty much young bucks and heifers–they
always come out strong on panoramas, you know, because it gives them a
chance to taste one another’s complexions in the dark.</p>
<p>“Well, the showman began to swell himself up for his lecture, and the
old mud-Jobber tackled the piano and ran his fingers up and down once or
twice to see that she was all right, and the fellows behind the curtain
commenced to grind out the panorama. The showman balanced his weight on
his right foot, and propped his hands over his hips, and flung his eyes
over his shoulder at the scenery, and said:</p>
<p>“‘Ladies and gentlemen, the painting now before you illustrates the
beautiful and touching parable of the Prodigal Son. Observe the happy
expression just breaking over the features of the poor, suffering youth
–so worn and weary with his long march; note also the ecstasy beaming
from the uplifted countenance of the aged father, and the joy that
sparkles in the eyes of the excited group of youths and maidens, and
seems ready to burst into the welcoming chorus from their lips. The
lesson, my friends, is as solemn and instructive as the story is tender
and beautiful.’</p>
<p>“The mud-Jobber was all ready, and when the second speech was
finished, struck up:</p>
<p>“Oh, we’ll all get blind drunk When Johnny comes marching home!</p>
<p>“Some of the people giggled, and some groaned a little. The showman
couldn’t say a word; he looked at the pianist sharp, but he was all
lovely and serene–he didn’t know there was anything out of gear.</p>
<p>“The panorama moved on, and the showman drummed up his grit and
started in fresh.</p>
<p>“‘Ladies and gentlemen, the fine picture now unfolding itself to your
gaze exhibits one of the most notable events in Bible history–our
Saviour and His disciples upon the Sea of Galilee. How grand, how
awe-inspiring are the reflections which the subject invokes! What
sublimity of faith is revealed to us in this lesson from the sacred
writings! The Saviour rebukes the angry waves, and walks securely upon
the bosom of the deep!’</p>
<p>“All around the house they were whispering, ‘Oh, how lovely, how
beautiful!’ and the orchestra let himself out again:</p>
<p>“A life on the ocean wave, And a home on the rolling deep!</p>
<p>“There was a good deal of honest snickering turned on this time, and
considerable groaning, and one or two old deacons got up and went out.
The showman grated his teeth, and cursed the piano man to himself; but
the fellow sat there like a knot on a log, and seemed to think he was
doing first-rate.</p>
<p>“After things got quiet the showman thought he would make one more
stagger at it, anyway, though his confidence was beginning to get mighty
shaky. The supes started the panorama grinding along again, and he
says:</p>
<p>“‘Ladies and gentlemen, this exquisite painting represents the
raising of Lazarus from the dead by our Saviour. The subject has been
handled with marvelous skill by the artist, and such touching sweetness
and tenderness of expression has he thrown into it that I have known
peculiarly sensitive persons to be even affected to tears by looking at
it. Observe the half-confused, half-inquiring look upon the countenance
of the awakened Lazarus. Observe, also, the attitude and expression of
the Saviour, who takes him gently by the sleeve of his shroud with one
hand, while He points with the other toward the distant city.’</p>
<p>“Before anybody could get off an opinion in the case the innocent old
ass at the piano struck up:</p>
<p>“Come rise up, William Ri-i-ley, And go along with me!</p>
<p>“Whe-ew! All the solemn old flats got up in a huff to go, and
everybody else laughed till the windows rattled.</p>
<p>“The showman went down and grabbed the orchestra and shook him up and
says:</p>
<p>“‘That lets you out, you know, you chowder-headed old clam. Go to the
doorkeeper and get your money, and cut your stick–vamose the ranch!
Ladies and gentlemen, circumstances over which I have no control compel
me prematurely to dismiss the house.’“</p>
<p>CURING A COLD–[Written about 1864]</p>
<p>It is a good thing, perhaps, to write for the amusement of the
public, but it is a far higher and nobler thing to write for their
instruction, their profit, their actual and tangible benefit. The latter
is the sole object of this article. If it prove the means of restoring
to health one solitary sufferer among my race, of lighting up once more
the fire of hope and joy in his faded eyes, or bringing back to his dead
heart again the quick, generous impulses of other days, I shall be amply
rewarded for my labor; my soul will be permeated with the sacred delight
a Christian. feels when he has done a good, unselfish deed.</p>
<p>Having led a pure and blameless life, I am justified in believing
that no man who knows me will reject the suggestions I am about to make,
out of fear that I am trying to deceive him. Let the public do itself
the honor to read my experience in doctoring a cold, as herein set
forth, and then follow in my footsteps.</p>
<p>When the White House was burned in Virginia City, I lost my home, my
happiness, my constitution, and my trunk. The loss of the two first
named articles was a matter of no great consequence, since a home
without a mother, or a sister, or a distant young female relative in it,
to remind you, by putting your soiled linen out of sight and taking your
boots down off the mantelpiece, that there are those who think about you
and care for you, is easily obtained. And I cared nothing for the loss
of my happiness, because, not being a poet, it could not be possible
that melancholy would abide with me long. But to lose a good
constitution and a better trunk were serious misfortunes. On the day of
the fire my constitution succumbed to a severe cold, caused by undue
exertion in getting ready to do something. I suffered to no purpose,
too, because the plan I was figuring at for the extinguishing of the
fire was so elaborate that I never got it completed until the middle of
the following week.</p>
<p>The first time I began to sneeze, a friend told me to go and bathe my
feet in hot water and go to bed. I did so. Shortly afterward, another
friend advised me to get up and take a cold shower-bath. I did that
also. Within the hour, another friend assured me that it was policy to
“feed a cold and starve a fever.“ I had both. So I thought it best to
fill myself up for the cold, and then keep dark and let the fever starve
awhile.</p>
<p>In a case of, this kind, I seldom do things by halves; I ate pretty
heartily; I conferred my custom upon a stranger who had just opened his
restaurant that morning; he waited near me in respectful silence until I
had finished feeding my cold, when he inquired if the people about
Virginia City were much afflicted with colds? I told him I thought they
were. He then went out and took in his sign.</p>
<p>I started down toward the office, and on the way encountered another
bosom friend, who told me that a quart of salt-water, taken warm, would
come as near curing a cold as anything in the world. I hardly thought I
had room for it, but I tried it anyhow. The result was surprising. I
believed I had thrown up my immortal soul.</p>
<p>Now, as I am giving my experience only for the benefit of those who
are troubled with the distemper I am writing about, I feel that they
will see the propriety of my cautioning them against following such
portions of it as proved inefficient with me, and acting upon this
conviction, I warn them against warm salt-water. It may be a good enough
remedy, but I think it is too severe. If I had another cold in the head,
and there were no course left me but to take either an earthquake or a
quart of warm saltwater, I would take my chances on the earthquake.</p>
<p>After the storm which had been raging in my stomach had subsided, and
no more good Samaritans happening along, I went on borrowing
handkerchiefs again and blowing them to atoms, as had been my custom in
the early stages of my cold, until I came across a lady who had just
arrived from over the plains, and who said she had lived in a part of
the country where doctors were scarce, and had from necessity acquired
considerable skill in the treatment of simple “family complaints.“ I
knew she must have had much experience, for she appeared to be a hundred
and fifty years old.</p>
<p>She mixed a decoction composed of molasses, aquafortis, turpentine,
and various other drugs, and instructed me to take a wine-glass full of
it every fifteen minutes. I never took but one dose; that was enough; it
robbed me of all moral principle, and awoke every unworthy impulse of my
nature. Under its malign influence my brain conceived miracles of
meanness, but my hands were too feeble to execute them; at that time,
had it not been that my strength had surrendered to a succession of
assaults from infallible remedies for my cold, I am satisfied that I
would have tried to rob the graveyard. Like most other people, I often
feel mean, and act accordingly; but until I took that medicine I had
never reveled in such supernatural depravity, and felt proud of it. At
the end of two days I was ready to go to doctoring again. I took a few
more unfailing remedies, and finally drove my cold from my head to my
lungs.</p>
<p>I got to coughing incessantly, and my voice fell below zero; I
conversed in a thundering bass, two octaves below my natural tone; I
could only compass my regular nightly repose by coughing myself down to
a state of utter exhaustion, and then the moment I began to talk in my
sleep, my discordant voice woke me up again.</p>
<p>My case grew more and more serious every day. A Plain gin was
recommended; I took it. Then gin and molasses; I took that also. Then
gin and onions; I added the onions, and took all three. I detected no
particular result, however, except that I had acquired a breath like a
buzzard’s.</p>
<p>I found I had to travel for my health. I went to Lake Bigler with my
reportorial comrade, Wilson. It is gratifying to me to reflect that we
traveled in considerable style; we went in the Pioneer coach, and my
friend took all his baggage with him, consisting of two excellent silk
handkerchiefs and a daguerreotype of his grandmother. We sailed and
hunted and fished and danced all day, and I doctored my cough all night.
By managing in this way, I made out to improve every hour in the
twenty-four. But my disease continued to grow worse.</p>
<p>A sheet-bath was recommended. I had never refused a remedy yet, and
it seemed poor policy to commence then; therefore I determined to take a
sheet-bath, notwithstanding I had no idea what sort of arrangement it
was. It was administered at midnight, and the weather was very frosty.
My breast and back were bared, and a sheet (there appeared to be a
thousand yards of it) soaked in ice-water, was wound around me until I
resembled a swab for a Columbiad.</p>
<p>It is a cruel expedient. When the chilly rag touches one’s warm
flesh, it makes him start with sudden violence, and gasp for breath just
as men do in the death-agony. It froze the marrow in my bones and
stopped the beating of my heart. I thought my time had come.</p>
<p>Young Wilson said the circumstance reminded him of an anecdote about
a negro who was being baptized, and who slipped from the parson’s grasp,
and came near being drowned. He floundered around, though, and finally
rose up out of the water considerably strangled and furiously angry, and
started ashore at once, spouting water like a whale, and remarking, with
great asperity, that “one o’ dese days some gen’l’man’s nigger gwyne to
get killed wid jis’ such damn foolishness as dis!“</p>
<p>Never take a sheet-bath-never. Next to meeting a lady acquaintance
who, for reasons best known to herself, don’t see you when she looks at
you, and don’t know you when she does see you, it is the most
uncomfortable thing in the world.</p>
<p>But, as I was saying, when the sheet-bath failed to cure my cough, a
lady friend recommended the application of a mustard plaster to my
breast. I believe that would have cured me effectually, if it had not
been for young Wilson. When I went to bed, I put my mustard plaster
–which was a very gorgeous one, eighteen inches square–where I could
reach it when I was ready for it. But young Wilson got hungry in the
night, and here is food for the imagination.</p>
<p>After sojourning a week at Lake Bigler, I went to Steamboat Springs,
and, besides the steam-baths, I took a lot of the vilest medicines that
were ever concocted. They would have cured me, but I had to go back to
Virginia City, where, notwithstanding the variety of new remedies I
absorbed every day, I managed to aggravate my disease by carelessness
and undue exposure.</p>
<p>I finally concluded to visit San Francisco, and the, first day I got
there a lady at the hotel told me to drink a quart of whisky every
twenty-four hours, and a friend up-town recommended precisely the same
course. Each advised me to take a quart; that made half a gallon. I did
it, and still live.</p>
<p>Now, with the kindest motives in the world, I offer for the
consideration of consumptive patients the variegated course of treatment
I have lately gone through. Let them try it; if it don’t cure, it can’t
more than kill them.</p>
