<h4 id="chapter-liii.">CHAPTER LIII.</h4>
<p>The session was drawing toward its close. Senator Dilworthy thought
he would run out west and shake hands with his constituents and let them
look at him. The legislature whose duty it would be to re-elect him to
the United States Senate, was already in session. Mr. Dilworthy
considered his re-election certain, but he was a careful, painstaking
man, and if, by visiting his State he could find the opportunity to
persuade a few more legislators to vote for him, he held the journey to
be well worth taking. The University bill was safe, now; he could leave
it without fear; it needed his presence and his watching no longer. But
there was a person in his State legislature who did need watching –a
person who, Senator Dilworthy said, was a narrow, grumbling,
uncomfortable malcontent–a person who was stolidly opposed to reform,
and progress and him,–a person who, he feared, had been bought with
money to combat him, and through him the commonwealth’s welfare and its
politics’ purity.</p>
<p>“If this person Noble,“ said Mr. Dilworthy, in a little speech at a
dinner party given him by some of his admirers, “merely desired to
sacrifice me.–I would willingly offer up my political life on the altar
of my dear State’s weal, I would be glad and grateful to do it; but when
he makes of me but a cloak to hide his deeper designs, when he proposes
to strike through me at the heart of my beloved State, all the lion in
me is roused–and I say here I stand, solitary and alone, but
unflinching, unquailing, thrice armed with my sacred trust; and whoso
passes, to do evil to this fair domain that looks to me for protection,
must do so over my dead body.“</p>
<p>He further said that if this Noble were a pure man, and merely
misguided, he could bear it, but that he should succeed in his wicked
designs through, a base use of money would leave a blot upon his State
which would work untold evil to the morals of the people, and that he
would not suffer; the public morals must not be contaminated. He would
seek this man Noble; he would argue, he would persuade, he would appeal
to his honor.</p>
<p>When he arrived on the ground he found his friends unterrified; they
were standing firmly by him and were full of courage. Noble was working
hard, too, but matters were against him, he was not making much
progress. Mr. Dilworthy took an early opportunity to send for Mr. Noble;
he had a midnight interview with him, and urged him to forsake his evil
ways; he begged him to come again and again, which he did. He finally
sent the man away at 3 o’clock one morning; and when he was gone,
Mr. Dilworthy said to himself,</p>
<p>“I feel a good deal relieved, now, a great deal relieved.“</p>
<p>The Senator now turned his attention to matters touching the souls of
his people. He appeared in church; he took a leading part in prayer
meetings; he met and encouraged the temperance societies; he graced the
sewing circles of the ladies with his presence, and even took a needle
now and then and made a stitch or two upon a calico shirt for some poor
Bibleless pagan of the South Seas, and this act enchanted the ladies,
who regarded the garments thus honored as in a manner sanctified. The
Senator wrought in Bible classes, and nothing could keep him away from
the Sunday Schools–neither sickness nor storms nor weariness. He even
traveled a tedious thirty miles in a poor little rickety stagecoach to
comply with the desire of the miserable hamlet of Cattleville that he
would let its Sunday School look upon him.</p>
<p>All the town was assembled at the stage office when he arrived, two
bonfires were burning, and a battery of anvils was popping exultant
broadsides; for a United States Senator was a sort of god in the
understanding of these people who never had seen any creature mightier
than a county judge. To them a United States Senator was a vast, vague
colossus, an awe inspiring unreality.</p>
<p>Next day everybody was at the village church a full half hour before
time for Sunday School to open; ranchmen and farmers had come with their
families from five miles around, all eager to get a glimpse of the great
man–the man who had been to Washington; the man who had seen the
President of the United States, and had even talked with him; the man
who had seen the actual Washington Monument–perhaps touched it with his
hands.</p>
<p>When the Senator arrived the Church was crowded, the windows were
full, the aisles were packed, so was the vestibule, and so indeed was
the yard in front of the building. As he worked his way through to the
pulpit on the arm of the minister and followed by the envied officials
of the village, every neck was stretched and, every eye twisted around
intervening obstructions to get a glimpse. Elderly people directed each
other’s attention and, said, “There! that’s him, with the grand, noble
forehead!“ Boys nudged each other and said, “Hi, Johnny, here he is,
there, that’s him, with the peeled head!“</p>
<p>The Senator took his seat in the pulpit, with the minister’ on one
side of him and the Superintendent of the Sunday School on the other.
The town dignitaries sat in an impressive row within the altar railings
below. The Sunday School children occupied ten of the front benches.
dressed in their best and most uncomfortable clothes, and with hair
combed and faces too clean to feel natural. So awed were they by the
presence of a living United States Senator, that during three minutes
not a “spit ball“ was thrown. After that they began to come to
themselves by degrees, and presently the spell was wholly gone and they
were reciting verses and pulling hair.</p>
<p>The usual Sunday School exercises were hurried through, and then the
minister, got up and bored the house with a speech built on the
customary Sunday School plan; then the Superintendent put in his oar;
then the town dignitaries had their say. They all made complimentary
reference to “their friend the, Senator,“ and told what a great and
illustrious man he was and what he had done for his country and for
religion and temperance, and exhorted the little boys to be good and
diligent and try to become like him some day. The speakers won the
deathless hatred of the house by these delays, but at last there was an
end and hope revived; inspiration was about to find utterance.</p>
<p>Senator Dilworthy rose and beamed upon the assemblage for a full
minute in silence. Then he smiled with an access of sweetness upon the
children and began:</p>
<p>“My little friends–for I hope that all these bright-faced little
people are my friends and will let me be their friend–my little friends,
I have traveled much, I have been in many cities and many States,
everywhere in our great and noble country, and by the blessing of
Providence I have been permitted to see many gatherings like this–but I
am proud, I am truly proud to say that I never have looked upon so much
intelligence, so much grace, such sweetness of disposition as I see in
the charming young countenances I see before me at this moment. I have
been asking myself as I sat here, Where am I? Am I in some far-off
monarchy, looking upon little princes and princesses? No. Am I in some
populous centre of my own country, where the choicest children of the
land have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize?
No. Am I in some strange foreign clime where the children are marvels
that we know not of? No. Then where am I? Yes–where am I? I am in a
simple, remote, unpretending settlement of my own dear State, and these
are the children of the noble and virtuous men who have made me what I
am! My soul is lost in wonder at the thought! And I humbly thank Him to
whom we are but as worms of the dust, that he has been pleased to call
me to serve such men! Earth has no higher, no grander position for me.
Let kings and emperors keep their tinsel crowns, I want them not; my
heart is here!</p>
<p>“Again I thought, Is this a theatre? No. Is it a concert or a gilded
opera? No. Is it some other vain, brilliant, beautiful temple of
soul-staining amusement and hilarity? No. Then what is it? What did my
consciousness reply? I ask you, my little friends, What did my
consciousness reply? It replied, It is the temple of the Lord! Ah, think
of that, now. I could hardly keep the tears back, I was so grateful. Oh,
how beautiful it is to see these ranks of sunny little faces assembled
here to learn the way of life; to learn to be good; to learn to be
useful; to learn to be pious; to learn to be great and glorious men and
women; to learn to be props and pillars of the State and shining lights
in the councils and the households of the nation; to be bearers of the
banner and soldiers of the cross in the rude campaigns of life, and
raptured souls in the happy fields of Paradise hereafter.</p>
<p>“Children, honor your parents and be grateful to them for providing
for you the precious privileges of a Sunday School.</p>
<p>“Now my dear little friends, sit up straight and pretty–there, that’s
it–and give me your attention and let me tell you about a poor little
Sunday School scholar I once knew.–He lived in the far west, and his
parents were poor. They could not give him a costly education; but they
were good and wise and they sent him to the Sunday School. He loved the
Sunday School. I hope you love your Sunday School–ah, I see by your
faces that you do! That is right!</p>
<p>“Well, this poor little boy was always in his place when the bell
rang, and he always knew his lesson; for his teachers wanted him to
learn and he loved his teachers dearly. Always love your teachers, my
children, for they love you more than you can know, now. He would not
let bad boys persuade him to go to play on Sunday. There was one little
bad boy who was always trying to persuade him, but he never could.</p>
<p>“So this poor little boy grew up to be a man, and had to go out in
the world, far from home and friends to earn his living. Temptations lay
all about him, and sometimes he was about to yield, but he would think
of some precious lesson he learned in his Sunday School a long time ago,
and that would save him. By and by he was elected to the
legislature–Then he did everything he could for Sunday Schools. He got
laws passed for them; he got Sunday Schools established wherever he
could.</p>
<p>“And by and by the people made him governor–and he said it was all
owing to the Sunday School.</p>
<p>“After a while the people elected him a Representative to the
Congress of the United States, and he grew very famous.–Now temptations
assailed him on every hand. People tried to get him to drink wine; to
dance, to go to theatres; they even tried to buy his vote; but no, the
memory of his Sunday School saved him from all harm; he remembered the
fate of the bad little boy who used to try to get him to play on Sunday,
and who grew up and became a drunkard and was hanged. He remembered
that, and was glad he never yielded and played on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Well, at last, what do you think happened? Why the people gave him a
towering, illustrious position, a grand, imposing position. And what do
you think it was? What should you say it was, children? It was Senator
of the United States! That poor little boy that loved his Sunday School
became that man. That man stands before you! All that he is, he owes to
the Sunday School.</p>
<p>“My precious children, love your parents, love your teachers, love
your Sunday School, be pious, be obedient, be honest, be diligent, and
then you will succeed in life and be honored of all men. Above all
things, my children, be honest. Above all things be pure-minded as the
snow. Let us join in prayer.“</p>
<p>When Senator Dilworthy departed from Cattleville, he left three dozen
boys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was
the United States Senate.</p>
<p>When be arrived at the State capital at midnight Mr. Noble came and
held a three-hours’ conference with him, and then as he was about
leaving said:</p>
<p>“I’ve worked hard, and I’ve got them at last. Six of them haven’t got
quite back-bone enough to slew around and come right out for you on the
first ballot to-morrow; but they’re going to vote against you on the
first for the sake of appearances, and then come out for you all in a
body on the second–I’ve fixed all that! By supper time to-morrow you’ll
be re-elected. You can go to bed and sleep easy on that.“</p>
<p>After Mr. Noble was gone, the Senator said:</p>
<p>“Well, to bring about a complexion of things like this was worth
coming West for.“</p>
