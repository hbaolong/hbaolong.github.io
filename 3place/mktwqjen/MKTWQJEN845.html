<h4 id="chapter-ivcathy-to-her-aunt-mercedes">CHAPTER IV–CATHY TO HER
AUNT MERCEDES</h4>
<p>Oh, it is wonderful here, aunty dear, just paradise! Oh, if you could
only see it! everything so wild and lovely; such grand plains,
stretching such miles and miles and miles, all the most delicious
velvety sand and sage-brush, and rabbits as big as a dog, and such tall
and noble jackassful ears that that is what they name them by; and such
vast mountains, and so rugged and craggy and lofty, with cloud-shawls
wrapped around their shoulders, and looking so solemn and awful and
satisfied; and the charming Indians, oh, how you would dote on them,
aunty dear, and they would on you, too, and they would let you hold
their babies, the way they do me, and they ARE the fattest, and
brownest, and sweetest little things, and never cry, and wouldn’t if
they had pins sticking in them, which they haven’t, because they are
poor and can’t afford it; and the horses and mules and cattle and
dogs–hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, and not an animal that you
can’t do what you please with, except uncle Thomas, but <em>I</em> don’t
mind him, he’s lovely; and oh, if you could hear the bugles:
TOO–TOO–TOO-TOO–TOO–TOO, and so on–perfectly beautiful! Do you recognize
that one? It’s the first toots of the reveille; it goes, dear me, SO
early in the morning!–then I and every other soldier on the whole place
are up and out in a minute, except uncle Thomas, who is most
unaccountably lazy, I don’t know why, but I have talked to him about it,
and I reckon it will be better, now. He hasn’t any faults much, and is
charming and sweet, like Buffalo Bill, and Thunder-Bird, and Mammy
Dorcas, and Soldier Boy, and Shekels, and Potter, and Sour-Mash,
and–well, they’re ALL that, just angels, as you may say.</p>
<p>The very first day I came, I don’t know how long ago it was, Buffalo
Bill took me on Soldier Boy to Thunder-Bird’s camp, not the big one
which is out on the plain, which is White Cloud’s, he took me to THAT
one next day, but this one is four or five miles up in the hills and
crags, where there is a great shut-in meadow, full of Indian lodges and
dogs and squaws and everything that is interesting, and a brook of the
clearest water running through it, with white pebbles on the bottom and
trees all along the banks cool and shady and good to wade in, and as the
sun goes down it is dimmish in there, but away up against the sky you
see the big peaks towering up and shining bright and vivid in the sun,
and sometimes an eagle sailing by them, not flapping a wing, the same as
if he was asleep; and young Indians and girls romping and laughing and
carrying on, around the spring and the pool, and not much clothes on
except the girls, and dogs fighting, and the squaws busy at work, and
the bucks busy resting, and the old men sitting in a bunch smoking, and
passing the pipe not to the left but to the right, which means there’s
been a row in the camp and they are settling it if they can, and
children playing JUST the same as any other children, and little boys
shooting at a mark with bows, and I cuffed one of them because he hit a
dog with a club that wasn’t doing anything, and he resented it but
before long he wished he hadn’t: but this sentence is getting too long
and I will start another. Thunder-Bird put on his Sunday-best war outfit
to let me see him, and he was splendid to look at, with his face painted
red and bright and intense like a fire-coal and a valance of eagle
feathers from the top of his head all down his back, and he had his
tomahawk, too, and his pipe, which has a stem which is longer than my
arm, and I never had such a good time in an Indian camp in my life, and
I learned a lot of words of the language, and next day BB took me to the
camp out on the Plains, four miles, and I had another good time and got
acquainted with some more Indians and dogs; and the big chief, by the
name of White Cloud, gave me a pretty little bow and arrows and I gave
him my red sash-ribbon, and in four days I could shoot very well with it
and beat any white boy of my size at the post; and I have been to those
camps plenty of times since; and I have learned to ride, too, BB taught
me, and every day he practises me and praises me, and every time I do
better than ever he lets me have a scamper on Soldier Boy, and THAT’S
the last agony of pleasure! for he is the charmingest horse, and so
beautiful and shiny and black, and hasn’t another color on him anywhere,
except a white star in his forehead, not just an imitation star, but a
real one, with four points, shaped exactly like a star that’s hand-made,
and if you should cover him all up but his star you would know him
anywhere, even in Jerusalem or Australia, by that. And I got acquainted
with a good many of the Seventh Cavalry, and the dragoons, and officers,
and families, and horses, in the first few days, and some more in the
next few and the next few and the next few, and now I know more soldiers
and horses than you can think, no matter how hard you try. I am keeping
up my studies every now and then, but there isn’t much time for it. I
love you so! and I send you a hug and a kiss.</p>
<p>CATHY.</p>
<p>P.S.–I belong to the Seventh Cavalry and Ninth Dragoons, I am an
officer, too, and do not have to work on account of not getting any
wages.</p>
