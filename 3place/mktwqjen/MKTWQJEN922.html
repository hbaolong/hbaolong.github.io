1882, MAINLY TO HOWELLS. WASTED FURY. OLD SCENES REVISITED. THE
MISSISSIPPI BOOK</h4>
<p>A man of Mark Twain’s profession and prominence must necessarily be
the subject of much newspaper comment. Jest, compliment, criticism –none
of these things disturbed him, as a rule. He was pleased that his books
should receive favorable notices by men whose opinion he respected, but
he was not grieved by adverse expressions. Jests at his expense, if well
written, usually amused him; cheap jokes only made him sad; but sarcasms
and innuendoes were likely to enrage him, particularly if he believed
them prompted by malice. Perhaps among all the letters he ever wrote,
there is none more characteristic than this confession of violence and
eagerness for reprisal, followed by his acknowledgment of error and a
manifest appreciation of his own weakness. It should be said that Mark
Twain and Whitelaw Reid were generally very good friends, and perhaps
for the moment this fact seemed to magnify the offense.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Jan. 28 ’82. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Nobody knows better than I,
that there are times when swearing cannot meet the emergency. How
sharply I feel that, at this moment. Not a single profane word has
issued from my lips this mornin –I have not even had the impulse to
swear, so wholly ineffectual would swearing have manifestly been, in the
circumstances. But I will tell you about it.</p>
<p>About three weeks ago, a sensitive friend, approaching his revelation
cautiously, intimated that the N. Y. Tribune was engaged in a kind of
crusade against me. This seemed a higher compliment than I deserved; but
no matter, it made me very angry. I asked many questions, and gathered,
in substance, this: Since Reid’s return from Europe, the Tribune had
been flinging sneers and brutalities at me with such persistent
frequency “as to attract general remark.“ I was an angered–which is just
as good an expression, I take it, as an hungered. Next, I learned that
Osgood, among the rest of the “general,“ was worrying over these
constant and pitiless attacks. Next came the testimony of another
friend, that the attacks were not merely “frequent,“ but “almost daily.“
Reflect upon that: “Almost daily“ insults, for two months on a stretch.
What would you have done?</p>
<p>As for me, I did the thing which was the natural thing for me to do,
that is, I set about contriving a plan to accomplish one or the other of
two things: 1. Force a peace; or 2. Get revenge. When I got my plan
finished, it pleased me marvelously. It was in six or seven sections,
each section to be used in its turn and by itself; the assault to begin
at once with No. 1, and the rest to follow, one after the other, to keep
the communication open while I wrote my biography of Reid. I meant to
wind up with this latter great work, and then dismiss the subject for
good.</p>
<p>Well, ever since then I have worked day and night making notes and
collecting and classifying material. I’ve got collectors at work in
England. I went to New York and sat three hours taking evidence while a
stenographer set it down. As my labors grew, so also grew my
fascination. Malice and malignity faded out of me–or maybe I drove them
out of me, knowing that a malignant book would hurt nobody but the fool
who wrote it. I got thoroughly in love with this work; for I saw that I
was going to write a book which the very devils and angels themselves
would delight to read, and which would draw disapproval from nobody but
the hero of it, (and Mrs. Clemens, who was bitter against the whole
thing.) One part of my plan was so delicious that I had to try my hand
on it right away, just for the luxury of it. I set about it, and sure
enough it panned out to admiration. I wrote that chapter most carefully,
and I couldn’t find a fault with it. (It was not for the biography–no,
it belonged to an immediate and deadlier project.)</p>
<p>Well, five days ago, this thought came into my mind (from
Mrs. Clemens’s): “Wouldn’t it be well to make sure that the attacks have
been ‘almost daily’?–and to also make sure that their number and
character will justify me in doing what I am proposing to do?“</p>
<p>I at once set a man to work in New York to seek out and copy every
unpleasant reference which had been made to me in the Tribune from
Nov. 1st to date. On my own part I began to watch the current numbers,
for I had subscribed for the paper.</p>
<p>The result arrived from my New York man this morning. O, what a
pitiable wreck of high hopes! The “almost daily“ assaults, for two
months, consist of–1. Adverse criticism of P. andandandand P. from an
enraged idiot in the London Atheneum; 2. Paragraph from some indignant
Englishman in the Pall Mall Gazette who pays me the vast compliment of
gravely rebuking some imaginary ass who has set me up in the
neighborhood of Rabelais; 3. A remark of the Tribune’s about the
Montreal dinner, touched with an almost invisible satire; 4. A remark of
the Tribune’s about refusal of Canadian copyright, not complimentary,
but not necessarily malicious–and of course adverse criticism which is
not malicious is a thing which none but fools irritate themselves
about.</p>
<p>There–that is the prodigious bugaboo, in its entirety! Can you
conceive of a man’s getting himself into a sweat over so diminutive a
provocation? I am sure I can’t. What the devil can those friends of mine
have been thinking about, to spread these 3 or 4 harmless things out
into two months of daily sneers and affronts? The whole offense, boiled
down, amounts to just this: one uncourteous remark of the Tribune about
my book–not me between Nov. 1 and Dec. 20; and a couple of foreign
criticisms (of my writings, not me,) between Nov. 1 and Jan. 26! If I
can’t stand that amount of friction, I certainly need reconstruction.
Further boiled down, this vast outpouring of malice amounts to simply
this: one jest from the Tribune (one can make nothing more serious than
that out of it.) One jest–and that is all; for the foreign criticisms do
not count, they being matters of news, and proper for publication in
anybody’s newspaper.</p>
<p>And to offset that one jest, the Tribune paid me one compliment
Dec. 23, by publishing my note declining the New York New England
dinner, while merely (in the same breath,) mentioning that similar
letters were read from General Sherman and other men whom we all know to
be persons of real consequence.</p>
<p>Well, my mountain has brought forth its mouse, and a sufficiently
small mouse it is, God knows. And my three weeks’ hard work have got to
go into the ignominious pigeon-hole. Confound it, I could have earned
ten thousand dollars with infinitely less trouble. However, I shouldn’t
have done it, for I am too lazy, now, in my sere and yellow leaf, to be
willing to work for anything but love….. I kind of envy you people who
are permitted for your righteousness’ sake to dwell in a boarding house;
not that I should always want to live in one, but I should like the
change occasionally from this housekeeping slavery to that wild
independence. A life of don’t-care-a-damn in a boarding house is what I
have asked for in many a secret prayer. I shall come by and by and
require of you what you have offered me there. Yours ever, MARK.</p>
<p>Howells, who had already known something of the gathering storm,
replied: “Your letter was an immense relief to me, for although I had an
abiding faith that you would get sick of your enterprise, I wasn’t easy
until I knew that you had given it up.“</p>
<p>Joel Chandler Harris appears again in the letters of this period.
Twichell, during a trip South about this time, had called on Harris with
some sort of proposition or suggestion from Clemens that Harris appear
with him in public, and tell, or read, the Remus stories from the
platform. But Harris was abnormally diffident. Clemens later pronounced
him “the shyest full-grown man“ he had ever met, and the word which
Twichell brought home evidently did not encourage the platform idea.</p>
<p>To Joel Chandler Harris, in Atlanta:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Apl. 2, ’82. Private.</p>
<p>MY DEAR MR. HARRIS,–Jo Twichell brought me your note and told me of
his talk with you. He said you didn’t believe you would ever be able to
muster a sufficiency of reckless daring to make you comfortable and at
ease before an audience. Well, I have thought out a device whereby I
believe we can get around that difficulty. I will explain when I see
you.</p>
<p>Jo says you want to go to Canada within a month or six weeks–I forget
just exactly what he did say; but he intimated the trip could be delayed
a while, if necessary. If this is so, suppose you meet Osgood and me in
New Orleans early in May–say somewhere between the 1st and 6th?</p>
<p>It will be well worth your while to do this, because the author who
goes to Canada unposted, will not know what course to pursue [to secure
copyright] when he gets there; he will find himself in a hopeless
confusion as to what is the correct thing to do. Now Osgood is the only
man in America, who can lay out your course for you and tell you exactly
what to do. Therefore, you just come to New Orleans and have a talk with
him.</p>
<p>Our idea is to strike across lots and reach St. Louis the 20th of
April –thence we propose to drift southward, stopping at some town a few
hours or a night, every day, and making notes.</p>
<p>To escape the interviewers, I shall follow my usual course and use a
fictitious name (C. L. Samuel, of New York.) I don’t know what Osgood’s
name will be, but he can’t use his own.</p>
<p>If you see your way to meet us in New Orleans, drop me a line, now,
and as we approach that city I will telegraph you what day we shall
arrive there.</p>
<p>I would go to Atlanta if I could, but shan’t be able. We shall go
back up the river to St. Paul, and thence by rail X-lots home.</p>
<p>(I am making this letter so dreadfully private and confidential
because my movements must be kept secret, else I shan’t be able to pick
up the kind of book-material I want.)</p>
<p>If you are diffident, I suspect that you ought to let Osgood be your
magazine-agent. He makes those people pay three or four times as much as
an article is worth, whereas I never had the cheek to make them pay more
than double. Yrs Sincerely S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>“My backwardness is an affliction,“ wrote Harris….. “The ordeal of
appearing on the stage would be a terrible one, but my experience is
that when a diffident man does become familiar with his surroundings he
has more impudence than his neighbors. Extremes meet.“</p>
<p>He was sorely tempted, but his courage became as water at the thought
of footlights and assembled listeners. Once in New York he appears to
have been caught unawares at a Tile Club dinner and made to tell a
story, but his agony was such that at the prospect of a similar ordeal
in Boston he avoided that city and headed straight for Georgia and
safety.</p>
<p>The New Orleans excursion with Osgood, as planned by Clemens, proved
a great success. The little party took the steamer Gold Dust from
St. Louis down river toward New Orleans. Clemens was quickly recognized,
of course, and his assumed name laid aside. The author of “Uncle Remus“
made the trip to New Orleans. George W. Cable was there at the time, and
we may believe that in the company of Mark Twain and Osgood those
Southern authors passed two or three delightful days. Clemens also met
his old teacher Bixby in New Orleans, and came back up the river with
him, spending most of his time in the pilot-house, as in the old days.
It was a glorious trip, and, reaching St. Louis, he continued it
northward, stopping off at Hannibal and Quincy.’</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Hartford:</p>
<p>QUINCY, ILL. May 17, ’82. Livy darling, I am desperately homesick.
But I have promised Osgood, and must stick it out; otherwise I would
take the train at once and break for home.</p>
<p>I have spent three delightful days in Hannibal, loitering around all
day long, examining the old localities and talking with the grey-heads
who were boys and girls with me 30 or 40 years ago. It has been a moving
time. I spent my nights with John and Helen Garth, three miles from
town, in their spacious and beautiful house. They were children with me,
and afterwards schoolmates. Now they have a daughter 19 or 20 years old.
Spent an hour, yesterday, with A. W. Lamb, who was not married when I
saw him last. He married a young lady whom I knew. And now I have been
talking with their grown-up sons and daughters. Lieutenant Hickman, the
spruce young handsomely-uniformed volunteer of 1846, called on me–a
grisly elephantine patriarch of 65 now, his grace all vanished.</p>
<p>That world which I knew in its blossoming youth is old and bowed and
melancholy, now; its soft cheeks are leathery and wrinkled, the fire is
gone out in its eyes, and the spring from its step. It will be dust and
ashes when I come again. I have been clasping hands with the moribund
–and usually they said, “It is for the last time.“</p>
<p>Now I am under way again, upon this hideous trip to St. Paul, with a
heart brimming full of thoughts and images of you and Susie and Bay and
the peerless Jean. And so good night, my love.</p>
<p>SAML.</p>
<p>Clemens’s trip had been saddened by learning, in New Orleans, the
news of the death of Dr. John Brown, of Edinburgh. To Doctor Brown’s
son, whom he had known as “Jock,“ he wrote immediately on his return to
Hartford.</p>
<p>To Mr. John Brown, in Edinburgh</p>
<p>HARTFORD, June 1, 1882. MY DEAR MR. BROWN,–I was three thousand miles
from home, at breakfast in New Orleans, when the damp morning paper
revealed the sorrowful news among the cable dispatches. There was no
place in America, however remote, or however rich, or poor or high or
humble where words of mourning for your father were not uttered that
morning, for his works had made him known and loved all over the land.
To Mrs. Clemens and me, the loss is personal; and our grief the grief
one feels for one who was peculiarly near and dear. Mrs. Clemens has
never ceased to express regret that we came away from England the last
time without going to see him, and often we have since projected a
voyage across the Atlantic for the sole purpose of taking him by the
hand and looking into his kind eyes once more before he should be called
to his rest.</p>
<p>We both thank you greatly for the Edinburgh papers which you sent. My
wife and I join in affectionate remembrances and greetings to yourself
and your aunt, and in the sincere tender of our sympathies.</p>
<p>Faithfully yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Our Susie is still “Megalops.“ He gave her that name:</p>
<p>Can you spare a photograph of your father? We have none but the one
taken in a group with ourselves.</p>
<p>William Dean Howells, at the age of forty-five, reached what many
still regard his highest point of achievement in American realism. His
novel, The Rise of Silas Lapham, which was running as a Century serial
during the summer of 1882, attracted wide attention, and upon its issue
in book form took first place among his published novels. Mark Twain, to
the end of his life, loved all that Howells wrote. Once, long afterward,
he said: “Most authors give us glimpses of a radiant moon, but Howells’s
moon shines and sails all night long.“ When the instalments of The Rise
of Silas Lapham began to appear, he overflowed in adjectives, the
sincerity of which we need not doubt, in view of his quite open
criticisms of the author’s reading delivery.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Belmont, Mass.:</p>
<p>MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I am in a state of wild enthusiasm over this July
instalment of your story. It’s perfectly dazzling–it’s masterly
–incomparable. Yet I heard you read it–without losing my balance. Well,
the difference between your reading and your writing is-remarkable. I
mean, in the effects produced and the impression left behind. Why, the
one is to the other as is one of Joe Twichell’s yarns repeated by a
somnambulist. Goodness gracious, you read me a chapter, and it is a
gentle, pearly dawn, with a sprinkle of faint stars in it; but by and by
I strike it in print, and shout to myself, “God bless us, how has that
pallid former spectacle been turned into these gorgeous sunset
splendors!“</p>
<p>Well, I don’t care how much you read your truck to me, you can’t
permanently damage it for me that way. It is always perfectly fresh and
dazzling when I come on it in the magazine. Of course I recognize the
form of it as being familiar–but that is all. That is, I remember it as
pyrotechnic figures which you set up before me, dead and cold, but ready
for the match–and now I see them touched off and all ablaze with
blinding fires. You can read, if you want to, but you don’t read worth a
damn. I know you can read, because your readings of Cable and your
repeatings of the German doctor’s remarks prove that.</p>
<p>That’s the best drunk scene–because the truest–that I ever read.
There are touches in it that I never saw any writer take note of before.
And they are set before the reader with amazing accuracy. How very
drunk, and how recently drunk, and how altogether admirably drunk you
must have been to enable you to contrive that masterpiece!</p>
<p>Why I didn’t notice that that religious interview between Marcia and
Mrs. Halleck was so deliciously humorous when you read it to me–but dear
me, it’s just too lovely for anything. (Wrote Clark to collar it for the
“Library.“)</p>
<p>Hang it, I know where the mystery is, now; when you are reading, you
glide right along, and I don’t get a chance to let the things soak home;
but when I catch it in the magazine, I give a page 20 or 30 minutes in
which to gently and thoroughly filter into me. Your humor is so very
subtle, and elusive–(well, often it’s just a vanishing breath of perfume
which a body isn’t certain he smelt till he stops and takes another
smell) whereas you can smell other</p>
<p>(Remainder obliterated.)</p>
<p>Among Mark Twain’s old schoolmates in Hannibal was little Helen
Kercheval, for whom in those early days he had a very tender spot
indeed. But she married another schoolmate, John Garth, who in time
became a banker, highly respected and a great influence. John and Helen
Garth have already been mentioned in the letter of May 17th.</p>
<p>To John Garth, in Hannibal:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, July 3 ’82. DEAR JOHN,–Your letter of June i9 arrived just
one day after we ought to have been in Elmira, N. Y. for the summer: but
at the last moment the baby was seized with scarlet fever. I had to
telegraph and countermand the order for special sleeping car; and in
fact we all had to fly around in a lively way and undo the patient
preparations of weeks–rehabilitate the dismantled house, unpack the
trunks, and so on. A couple of days later, the eldest child was taken
down with so fierce a fever that she was soon delirious–not scarlet
fever, however. Next, I myself was stretched on the bed with three
diseases at once, and all of them fatal. But I never did care for fatal
diseases if I could only have privacy and room to express myself
concerning them.</p>
<p>We gave early warning, and of course nobody has entered the house in
all this time but one or two reckless old bachelors–and they probably
wanted to carry the disease to the children of former flames of theirs.
The house is still in quarantine and must remain so for a week or two
yet–at which time we are hoping to leave for Elmira. Always your friend
S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>By the end of summer Howells was in Europe, and Clemens, in Elmira,
was trying to finish his Mississippi book, which was giving him a great
deal of trouble. It was usually so with his non-fiction books; his
interest in them was not cumulative; he was prone to grow weary of them,
while the menace of his publisher’s contract was maddening. Howells’s
letters, meant to be comforting, or at least entertaining, did not
always contribute to his peace of mind. The Library of American Humor
which they had planned was an added burden. Before sailing, Howells had
written: “Do you suppose you can do your share of the reading at Elmira,
while you are writing at the Mississippi book?“</p>
<p>In a letter from London, Howells writes of the good times he is
having over there with Osgood, Hutton, John Hay, Aldrich, and Alma
Tadema, excursioning to Oxford, feasting, especially “at the Mitre
Tavern, where they let you choose your dinner from the joints hanging
from the rafter, and have passages that you lose yourself in every time
you try to go to your room….. Couldn’t you and Mrs. Clemens step over
for a little while?….. We have seen lots of nice people and have been
most pleasantly made of; but I would rather have you smoke in my face,
and talk for half a day just for pleasure, than to go to the best house
or club in London.“ The reader will gather that this could not be
entirely soothing to a man shackled by a contract and a book that
refused to come to an end.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in London:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, CONN. Oct 30, 1882. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I do not expect to
find you, so I shan’t spend many words on you to wind up in the
perdition of some European dead-letter office. I only just want to say
that the closing installments of the story are prodigious. All along I
was afraid it would be impossible for you to keep up so splendidly to
the end; but you were only, I see now, striking eleven. It is in these
last chapters that you struck twelve. Go on and write; you can write
good books yet, but you can never match this one. And speaking of the
book, I inclose something which has been happening here lately.</p>
<p>We have only just arrived at home, and I have not seen Clark on our
matters. I cannot see him or any one else, until I get my book finished.
The weather turned cold, and we had to rush home, while I still lacked
thirty thousand words. I had been sick and got delayed. I am going to
write all day and two thirds of the night, until the thing is done, or
break down at it. The spur and burden of the contract are intolerable to
me. I can endure the irritation of it no longer. I went to work at nine
o’clock yesterday morning, and went to bed an hour after midnight.
Result of the day, (mainly stolen from books, tho’ credit given,) 9500
words, so I reduced my burden by one third in one day. It was five days
work in one. I have nothing more to borrow or steal; the rest must all
be written. It is ten days work, and unless something breaks, it will be
finished in five. We all send love to you and Mrs. Howells, and all the
family. Yours as ever, MARK.</p>
<p>Again, from Villeneuve, on lake Geneva, Howells wrote urging him this
time to spend the winter with them in Florence, where they would write
their great American Comedy of ‘Orme’s Motor,’ “which is to enrich us
beyond the dreams of avarice…. We could have a lot of fun writing it,
and you could go home with some of the good old Etruscan malaria in your
bones, instead of the wretched pinch-beck Hartford article that you are
suffering from now…. it’s a great opportunity for you. Besides, nobody
over there likes you half as well as I do.“</p>
<p>It should be added that ‘Orme’s Motor’ was the provisional title that
Clemens and Howells had selected for their comedy, which was to be
built, in some measure, at least, around the character, or rather from
the peculiarities, of Orion Clemens. The Cable mentioned in Mark Twain’s
reply is, of course, George W. Cable, who only a little while before had
come up from New Orleans to conquer the North with his wonderful tales
and readings.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Switzerland:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Nov. 4th, 1882. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Yes, it would be
profitable for me to do that, because with your society to help me, I
should swiftly finish this now apparently interminable book. But I
cannot come, because I am not Boss here, and nothing but dynamite can
move Mrs. Clemens away from home in the winter season.</p>
<p>I never had such a fight over a book in my life before. And the
foolishest part of the whole business is, that I started Osgood to
editing it before I had finished writing it. As a consequence, large
areas of it are condemned here and there and yonder, and I have the
burden of these unfilled gaps harassing me and the thought of the broken
continuity of the work, while I am at the same time trying to build the
last quarter of the book. However, at last I have said with sufficient
positiveness that I will finish the book at no particular date; that I
will not hurry it; that I will not hurry myself; that I will take things
easy and comfortably, write when I choose to write, leave it alone when
I so prefer. The printers must wait, the artists, the canvassers, and
all the rest. I have got everything at a dead standstill, and that is
where it ought to be, and that is where it must remain; to follow any
other policy would be to make the book worse than it already is. I ought
to have finished it before showing to anybody, and then sent it across
the ocean to you to be edited, as usual; for you seem to be a great many
shades happier than you deserve to be, and if I had thought of this
thing earlier, I would have acted upon it and taken the tuck somewhat
out of your joyousness.</p>
<p>In the same mail with your letter, arrived the enclosed from Orme the
motor man. You will observe that he has an office. I will explain that
this is a law office and I think it probably does him as much good to
have a law office without anything to do in it, as it would another man
to have one with an active business attached. You see he is on the
electric light lay now. Going to light the city and allow me to take all
the stock if I want to. And he will manage it free of charge. It never
would occur to this simple soul how much less costly it would be to me,
to hire him on a good salary not to manage it. Do you observe the same
old eagerness, the same old hurry, springing from the fear that if he
does not move with the utmost swiftness, that colossal opportunity will
escape him? Now just fancy this same frantic plunging after vast
opportunities, going on week after week with this same man, during fifty
entire years, and he has not yet learned, in the slightest degree, that
there isn’t any occasion to hurry; that his vast opportunity will always
wait; and that whether it waits or flies, he certainly will never catch
it. This immortal hopefulness, fortified by its immortal and unteachable
misjudgment, is the immortal feature of this character, for a play; and
we will write that play. We should be fools else. That staccato
postscript reads as if some new and mighty business were imminent, for
it is slung on the paper telegraphically, all the small words left out.
I am afraid something newer and bigger than the electric light is
swinging across his orbit. Save this letter for an inspiration. I have
got a hundred more.</p>
<p>Cable has been here, creating worshipers on all hands. He is a
marvelous talker on a deep subject. I do not see how even Spencer could
unwind a thought more smoothly or orderly, and do it in a cleaner,
clearer, crisper English. He astounded Twichell with his faculty. You
know when it comes down to moral honesty, limpid innocence, and utterly
blemishless piety, the Apostles were mere policemen to Cable; so with
this in mind you must imagine him at a midnight dinner in Boston the
other night, where we gathered around the board of the Summerset Club;
Osgood, full, Boyle O’Reilly, full, Fairchild responsively loaded, and
Aldrich and myself possessing the floor, and properly fortified. Cable
told Mrs. Clemens when he returned here, that he seemed to have been
entertaining himself with horses, and had a dreamy idea that he must
have gone to Boston in a cattle-car. It was a very large time. He called
it an orgy. And no doubt it was, viewed from his standpoint.</p>
<p>I wish I were in Switzerland, and I wish we could go to Florence; but
we have to leave these delights to you; there is no helping it. We all
join in love to you and all the family. Yours as ever MARK.</p>
