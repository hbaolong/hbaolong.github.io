<h4 id="a-monument-to-adam">A MONUMENT TO ADAM</h4>
<p>Some one has revealed to the TRIBUNE that I once suggested to
Rev. Thomas K. Beecher, of Elmira, New York, that we get up a monument
to Adam, and that Mr. Beecher favored the project. There is more to it
than that. The matter started as a joke, but it came somewhat near to
materializing.</p>
<p>It is long ago–thirty years. Mr. Darwin’s DESCENT OF MAN has been in
print five or six years, and the storm of indignation raised by it was
still raging in pulpits and periodicals. In tracing the genesis of the
human race back to its sources, Mr. Darwin had left Adam out altogether.
We had monkeys, and “missing links,“ and plenty of other kinds of
ancestors, but no Adam. Jesting with Mr. Beecher and other friends in
Elmira, I said there seemed to be a likelihood that the world would
discard Adam and accept the monkey, and that in the course of time
Adam’s very name would be forgotten in the earth; therefore this
calamity ought to be averted; a monument would accomplish this, and
Elmira ought not to waste this honorable opportunity to do Adam a favor
and herself a credit.</p>
<p>Then the unexpected happened. Two bankers came forward and took hold
of the matter–not for fun, not for sentiment, but because they saw in
the monument certain commercial advantages for the town. The project had
seemed gently humorous before–it was more than that now, with this stern
business gravity injected into it. The bankers discussed the monument
with me. We met several times. They proposed an indestructible memorial,
to cost twenty-five thousand dollars. The insane oddity of a monument
set up in a village to preserve a name that would outlast the hills and
the rocks without any such help, would advertise Elmira to the ends of
the earth –and draw custom. It would be the only monument on the planet
to Adam, and in the matter of interest and impressiveness could never
have a rival until somebody should set up a monument to the Milky
Way.</p>
<p>People would come from every corner of the globe and stop off to look
at it, no tour of the world would be complete that left out Adam’s
monument. Elmira would be a Mecca; there would be pilgrim ships at
pilgrim rates, pilgrim specials on the continent’s railways; libraries
would be written about the monument, every tourist would kodak it,
models of it would be for sale everywhere in the earth, its form would
become as familiar as the figure of Napoleon.</p>
<p>One of the bankers subscribed five thousand dollars, and I think the
other one subscribed half as much, but I do not remember with certainty
now whether that was the figure or not. We got designs made –some of
them came from Paris.</p>
<p>In the beginning–as a detail of the project when it was yet a joke –I
had framed a humble and beseeching and perfervid petition to Congress
begging the government to built the monument, as a testimony of the
Great Republic’s gratitude to the Father of the Human Race and as a
token of her loyalty to him in this dark day of humiliation when his
older children were doubting and deserting him. It seemed to me that
this petition ought to be presented, now–it would be widely and
feelingly abused and ridiculed and cursed, and would advertise our
scheme and make our ground-floor stock go off briskly. So I sent it to
General Joseph R. Hawley, who was then in the House, and he said he
would present it. But he did not do it. I think he explained that when
he came to read it he was afraid of it: it was too serious, to gushy,
too sentimental–the House might take it for earnest.</p>
<p>We ought to have carried out our monument scheme; we could have
managed it without any great difficulty, and Elmira would now be the
most celebrated town in the universe.</p>
<p>Very recently I began to build a book in which one of the minor
characters touches incidentally upon a project for a monument to Adam,
and now the TRIBUNE has come upon a trace of the forgotten jest of
thirty years ago. Apparently mental telegraphy is still in business. It
is odd; but the freaks of mental telegraphy are usually odd.</p>
