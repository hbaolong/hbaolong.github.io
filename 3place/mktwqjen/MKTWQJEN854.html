<h4 id="chapter-xiiigeneral-alison-to-his-mother">CHAPTER XIII–GENERAL
ALISON TO HIS MOTHER</h4>
<p>It was a prodigious trip, but delightful, of course, through the
Rockies and the Black Hills and the mighty sweep of the Great Plains to
civilization and the Missouri border–where the railroading began and the
delightfulness ended. But no one is the worse for the journey; certainly
not Cathy, nor Dorcas, nor Soldier Boy; and as for me, I am not
complaining.</p>
<p>Spain is all that Cathy had pictured it–and more, she says. She is in
a fury of delight, the maddest little animal that ever was, and all for
joy. She thinks she remembers Spain, but that is not very likely, I
suppose. The two–Mercedes and Cathy–devour each other. It is a rapture
of love, and beautiful to see. It is Spanish; that describes it. Will
this be a short visit?</p>
<p>No. It will be permanent. Cathy has elected to abide with Spain and
her aunt. Dorcas says she (Dorcas) foresaw that this would happen; and
also says that she wanted it to happen, and says the child’s own country
is the right place for her, and that she ought not to have been sent to
me, I ought to have gone to her. I thought it insane to take Soldier Boy
to Spain, but it was well that I yielded to Cathy’s pleadings; if he had
been left behind, half of her heart would have remained with him, and
she would not have been contented. As it is, everything has fallen out
for the best, and we are all satisfied and comfortable. It may be that
Dorcas and I will see America again some day; but also it is a case of
maybe not.</p>
<p>We left the post in the early morning. It was an affecting time. The
women cried over Cathy, so did even those stern warriors, the Rocky
Mountain Rangers; Shekels was there, and the Cid, and Sardanapalus, and
Potter, and Mongrel, and Sour-Mash, Famine, and Pestilence, and Cathy
kissed them all and wept; details of the several arms of the garrison
were present to represent the rest, and say good-bye and God bless you
for all the soldiery; and there was a special squad from the Seventh,
with the oldest veteran at its head, to speed the Seventh’s Child with
grand honors and impressive ceremonies; and the veteran had a touching
speech by heart, and put up his hand in salute and tried to say it, but
his lips trembled and his voice broke, but Cathy bent down from the
saddle and kissed him on the mouth and turned his defeat to victory, and
a cheer went up.</p>
<p>The next act closed the ceremonies, and was a moving surprise. It may
be that you have discovered, before this, that the rigors of military
law and custom melt insensibly away and disappear when a soldier or a
regiment or the garrison wants to do something that will please Cathy.
The bands conceived the idea of stirring her soldierly heart with a
farewell which would remain in her memory always, beautiful and
unfading, and bring back the past and its love for her whenever she
should think of it; so they got their project placed before General
Burnaby, my successor, who is Cathy’s newest slave, and in spite of
poverty of precedents they got his permission. The bands knew the
child’s favorite military airs. By this hint you know what is coming,
but Cathy didn’t. She was asked to sound the “reveille,“ which she
did.</p>
<p>[REVEILLE]</p>
<p>With the last note the bands burst out with a crash: and woke the
mountains with the “Star-Spangled Banner“ in a way to make a body’s
heart swell and thump and his hair rise! It was enough to break a person
all up, to see Cathy’s radiant face shining out through her gladness and
tears. By request she blew the “assembly,“ now. . . .</p>
<p>[THE ASSEMBLY]</p>
<p>. . . Then the bands thundered in, with “Rally round the flag, boys,
rally once again!“ Next, she blew another call (“to the Standard“) . .
.</p>
<p>[TO THE STANDARD]</p>
<p>. . . and the bands responded with “When we were marching through
Georgia.“ Straightway she sounded “boots and saddles,“ that thrilling
and most expediting call. . . .</p>
<p>[BOOTS AND SADDLES]</p>
<p>and the bands could hardly hold in for the final note; then they
turned their whole strength loose on “Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are
marching,“ and everybody’s excitement rose to blood-heat.</p>
<p>Now an impressive pause–then the bugle sang “TAPS“–translatable, this
time, into “Good-bye, and God keep us all!“ for taps is the soldier’s
nightly release from duty, and farewell: plaintive, sweet, pathetic, for
the morning is never sure, for him; always it is possible that he is
hearing it for the last time. . . .</p>
<p>[TAPS]</p>
<p>. . . Then the bands turned their instruments towards Cathy and burst
in with that rollicking frenzy of a tune, “Oh, we’ll all get blind drunk
when Johnny comes marching home–yes, we’ll all get blind drunk when
Johnny comes marching home!“ and followed it instantly with “Dixie,“
that antidote for melancholy, merriest and gladdest of all military
music on any side of the ocean–and that was the end. And
so–farewell!</p>
<p>I wish you could have been there to see it all, hear it all, and feel
it: and get yourself blown away with the hurricane huzza that swept the
place as a finish.</p>
<p>When we rode away, our main body had already been on the road an hour
or two–I speak of our camp equipage; but we didn’t move off alone: when
Cathy blew the “advance“ the Rangers cantered out in column of fours,
and gave us escort, and were joined by White Cloud and Thunder-Bird in
all their gaudy bravery, and by Buffalo Bill and four subordinate
scouts. Three miles away, in the Plains, the Lieutenant-General halted,
sat her horse like a military statue, the bugle at her lips, and put the
Rangers through the evolutions for half an hour; and finally, when she
blew the “charge,“ she led it herself. “Not for the last time,“ she
said, and got a cheer, and we said good-bye all around, and faced
eastward and rode away.</p>
<p>Postscript. A Day Later. Soldier Boy was stolen last night. Cathy is
almost beside herself, and we cannot comfort her. Mercedes and I are not
much alarmed about the horse, although this part of Spain is in
something of a turmoil, politically, at present, and there is a good
deal of lawlessness. In ordinary times the thief and the horse would
soon be captured. We shall have them before long, I think.</p>
