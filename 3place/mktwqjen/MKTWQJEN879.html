<h4 id="letter-iii">LETTER III</h4>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, 18–. DEAR CHING-FOO: I stepped ashore jubilant! I
wanted to dance, shout, sing, worship the generous Land of the Free and
Home of the Brave. But as I walked from the gangplank a man in a gray
uniform–[Policeman] –kicked me violently behind and told me to look
out–so my employer translated it. As I turned, another officer of the
same kind struck me with a short club and also instructed me to look
out. I was about to take hold of my end of the pole which had mine and
Hong-Wo’s basket and things suspended from it, when a third officer hit
me with his club to signify that I was to drop it, and then kicked me to
signify that he was satisfied with my promptness. Another person came
now, and searched all through our basket and bundles, emptying
everything out on the dirty wharf. Then this person and another searched
us all over. They found a little package of opium sewed into the
artificial part of Hong-Wo’s queue, and they took that, and also they
made him prisoner and handed him over to an officer, who marched him
away. They took his luggage, too, because of his crime, and as our
luggage was so mixed together that they could not tell mine from his,
they took it all. When I offered to help divide it, they kicked me and
desired me to look out.</p>
<p>Having now no baggage and no companion, I told my employer that if he
was willing, I would walk about a little and see the city and the people
until he needed me. I did not like to seem disappointed with my
reception in the good land of refuge for the oppressed, and so I looked
and spoke as cheerily as I could. But he said, wait a minute–I must be
vaccinated to prevent my taking the small-pox. I smiled and said I had
already had the small-pox, as he could see by the marks, and so I need
not wait to be “vaccinated,“ as he called it. But he said it was the
law, and I must be vaccinated anyhow. The doctor would never let me
pass, for the law obliged him to vaccinate all Chinamen and charge them
ten dollars apiece for it, and I might be sure that no doctor who would
be the servant of that law would let a fee slip through his fingers to
accommodate any absurd fool who had seen fit to have the disease in some
other country. And presently the doctor came and did his work and took
my last penny–my ten dollars which were the hard savings of nearly a
year and a half of labour and privation. Ah, if the law-makers had only
known there were plenty of doctors in the city glad of a chance to
vaccinate people for a dollar or two, they would never have put the
price up so high against a poor friendless Irish, or Italian, or Chinese
pauper fleeing to the good land to escape hunger and hard times.</p>
<p>AH SONG HI.</p>
