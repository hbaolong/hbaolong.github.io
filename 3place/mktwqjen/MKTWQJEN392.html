<h4 id="chapter-9-continued-perplexities">Chapter 9 Continued
Perplexities</h4>
<p>THERE was no use in arguing with a person like this. I promptly put
such a strain on my memory that by and by even the shoal water and the
countless crossing-marks began to stay with me. But the result was just
the same. I never could more than get one knotty thing learned before
another presented itself. Now I had often seen pilots gazing at the
water and pretending to read it as if it were a book; but it was a book
that told me nothing. A time came at last, however, when Mr. Bixby
seemed to think me far enough advanced to bear a lesson on water-
reading. So he began–</p>
<p>‘Do you see that long slanting line on the face of the water? Now,
that’s a reef. Moreover, it’s a bluff reef. There is a solid sand-bar
under it that is nearly as straight up and down as the side of a house.
There is plenty of water close up to it, but mighty little on top of it.
If you were to hit it you would knock the boat’s brains out. Do you see
where the line fringes out at the upper end and begins to fade
away?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>
<p>‘Well, that is a low place; that is the head of the reef. You can
climb over there, and not hurt anything. Cross over, now, and follow
along close under the reef–easy water there–not much current.’</p>
<p>I followed the reef along till I approached the fringed end. Then
Mr. Bixby said–</p>
<p>‘Now get ready. Wait till I give the word. She won’t want to mount
the reef; a boat hates shoal water. Stand by–wait–WAIT–keep her well in
hand. NOW cramp her down! Snatch her! snatch her!’</p>
<p>He seized the other side of the wheel and helped to spin it around
until it was hard down, and then we held it so. The boat resisted, and
refused to answer for a while, and next she came surging to starboard,
mounted the reef, and sent a long, angry ridge of water foaming away
from her bows.</p>
<p>’Now watch her; watch her like a cat, or she’ll get away from you.
When she fights strong and the tiller slips a little, in a jerky, greasy
sort of way, let up on her a trifle; it is the way she tells you at
night that the water is too shoal; but keep edging her up, little by
little, toward the point. You are well up on the bar, now; there is a
bar under every point, because the water that comes down around it forms
an eddy and allows the sediment to sink. Do you see those fine lines on
the face of the water that branch out like the ribs of a fan. Well,
those are little reefs; you want to just miss the ends of them, but run
them pretty close. Now look out–look out! Don’t you crowd that slick,
greasy-looking place; there ain’t nine feet there; she won’t stand it.
She begins to smell it; look sharp, I tell you! Oh blazes, there you go!
Stop the starboard wheel! Quick! Ship up to back! Set her back!</p>
<p>The engine bells jingled and the engines answered promptly, shooting
white columns of steam far aloft out of the ‘scape pipes, but it was too
late. The boat had ’smelt’ the bar in good earnest; the foamy ridges
that radiated from her bows suddenly disappeared, a great dead swell
came rolling forward and swept ahead of her, she careened far over to
larboard, and went tearing away toward the other shore as if she were
about scared to death. We were a good mile from where we ought to have
been, when we finally got the upper hand of her again.</p>
<p>During the afternoon watch the next day, Mr. Bixby asked me if I knew
how to run the next few miles. I said–</p>
<p>‘Go inside the first snag above the point, outside the next one,
start out from the lower end of Higgins’s wood-yard, make a square
crossing and–’</p>
<p>‘That’s all right. I’ll be back before you close up on the next
point.’</p>
<p>But he wasn’t. He was still below when I rounded it and entered upon
a piece of river which I had some misgivings about. I did not know that
he was hiding behind a chimney to see how I would perform. I went gaily
along, getting prouder and prouder, for he had never left the boat in my
sole charge such a length of time before. I even got to ‘setting’ her
and letting the wheel go, entirely, while I vaingloriously turned my
back and inspected the stem marks and hummed a tune, a sort of easy
indifference which I had prodigiously admired in Bixby and other great
pilots. Once I inspected rather long, and when I faced to the front
again my heart flew into my mouth so suddenly that if I hadn’t clapped
my teeth together I should have lost it. One of those frightful bluff
reefs was stretching its deadly length right across our bows! My head
was gone in a moment; I did not know which end I stood on; I gasped and
could not get my breath; I spun the wheel down with such rapidity that
it wove itself together like a spider’s web; the boat answered and
turned square away from the reef, but the reef followed her! I fled, and
still it followed, still it kept–right across my bows! I never looked to
see where I was going, I only fled. The awful crash was imminent–why
didn’t that villain come! If I committed the crime of ringing a bell, I
might get thrown overboard. But better that than kill the boat. So in
blind desperation I started such a rattling ‘shivaree’ down below as
never had astounded an engineer in this world before, I fancy. Amidst
the frenzy of the bells the engines began to back and fill in a furious
way, and my reason forsook its throne–we were about to crash into the
woods on the other side of the river. Just then Mr. Bixby stepped calmly
into view on the hurricane deck. My soul went out to him in gratitude.
My distress vanished; I would have felt safe on the brink of Niagara,
with Mr. Bixby on the hurricane deck. He blandly and sweetly took his
tooth-pick out of his mouth between his fingers, as if it were a cigar–
we were just in the act of climbing an overhanging big tree, and the
passengers were scudding astern like rats–and lifted up these commands
to me ever so gently–</p>
<p>‘Stop the starboard. Stop the larboard. Set her back on both.’</p>
<p>The boat hesitated, halted, pressed her nose among the boughs a
critical instant, then reluctantly began to back away.</p>
<p>‘Stop the larboard. Come ahead on it. Stop the starboard. Come ahead
on it. Point her for the bar.’</p>
<p>I sailed away as serenely as a summer’s morning Mr. Bixby came in and
said, with mock simplicity–</p>
<p>‘When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three
times before you land, so that the engineers can get ready.’</p>
<p>I blushed under the sarcasm, and said I hadn’t had any hail.</p>
<p>‘Ah! Then it was for wood, I suppose. The officer of the watch will
tell you when he wants to wood up.’</p>
<p>I went on consuming and said I wasn’t after wood.</p>
<p>‘Indeed? Why, what could you want over here in the bend, then? Did
you ever know of a boat following a bend up-stream at this stage of the
river?’</p>
<p>‘No sir,–and I wasn’t trying to follow it. I was getting away from a
bluff reef.’</p>
<p>‘No, it wasn’t a bluff reef; there isn’t one within three miles of
where you were.’</p>
<p>‘But I saw it. It was as bluff as that one yonder.’</p>
<p>‘Just about. Run over it!’</p>
<p>‘Do you give it as an order?’</p>
<p>‘Yes. Run over it.’</p>
<p>‘If I don’t, I wish I may die.’</p>
<p>‘All right; I am taking the responsibility.’ I was just as anxious to
kill the boat, now, as I had been to save her before. I impressed my
orders upon my memory, to be used at the inquest, and made a straight
break for the reef. As it disappeared under our bows I held my breath;
but we slid over it like oil.</p>
<p>‘Now don’t you see the difference? It wasn’t anything but a WIND
reef. The wind does that.’</p>
<p>‘So I see. But it is exactly like a bluff reef. How am I ever going
to tell them apart?’</p>
<p>‘I can’t tell you. It is an instinct. By and by you will just
naturally KNOW one from the other, but you never will be able to explain
why or how you know them apart’</p>
<p>It turned out to be true. The face of the water, in time, became a
wonderful book–a book that was a dead language to the uneducated
passenger, but which told its mind to me without reserve, delivering its
most cherished secrets as clearly as if it uttered them with a voice.
And it was not a book to be read once and thrown aside, for it had a new
story to tell every day. Throughout the long twelve hundred miles there
was never a page that was void of interest, never one that you could
leave unread without loss, never one that you would want to skip,
thinking you could find higher enjoyment in some other thing. There
never was so wonderful a book written by man; never one whose interest
was so absorbing, so unflagging, so sparkingly renewed with every
reperusal. The passenger who could not read it was charmed with a
peculiar sort of faint dimple on its surface (on the rare occasions when
he did not overlook it altogether); but to the pilot that was an
ITALICIZED passage; indeed, it was more than that, it was a legend of
the largest capitals, with a string of shouting exclamation points at
the end of it; for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that
could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated. It is
the faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes, and the most
hideous to a pilot’s eye. In truth, the passenger who could not read
this book saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it painted by
the sun and shaded by the clouds, whereas to the trained eye these were
not pictures at all, but the grimmest and most dead-earnest of
reading-matter.</p>
<p>Now when I had mastered the language of this water and had come to
know every trifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly
as I knew the letters of the alphabet, I had made a valuable
acquisition. But I had lost something, too. I had lost something which
could never be restored to me while I lived. All the grace, the beauty,
the poetry had gone out of the majestic river! I still keep in mind a
certain wonderful sunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new to
me. A broad expanse of the river was turned to blood; in the middle
distance the red hue brightened into gold, through which a solitary log
came floating, black and conspicuous; in one place a long, slanting mark
lay sparkling upon the water; in another the surface was broken by
boiling, tumbling rings, that were as many-tinted as an opal; where the
ruddy flush was faintest, was a smooth spot that was covered with
graceful circles and radiating lines, ever so delicately traced; the
shore on our left was densely wooded, and the somber shadow that fell
from this forest was broken in one place by a long, ruffled trail that
shone like silver; and high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead
tree waved a single leafy bough that glowed like a flame in the
unobstructed splendor that was flowing from the sun. There were graceful
curves, reflected images, woody heights, soft distances; and over the
whole scene, far and near, the dissolving lights drifted steadily,
enriching it, every passing moment, with new marvels of coloring.</p>
<p>I stood like one bewitched. I drank it in, in a speechless rapture.
The world was new to me, and I had never seen anything like this at
home. But as I have said, a day came when I began to cease from noting
the glories and the charms which the moon and the sun and the twilight
wrought upon the river’s face; another day came when I ceased altogether
to note them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I should
have looked upon it without rapture, and should have commented upon it,
inwardly, after this fashion: This sun means that we are going to have
wind to-morrow; that floating log means that the river is rising, small
thanks to it; that slanting mark on the water refers to a bluff reef
which is going to kill somebody’s steamboat one of these nights, if it
keeps on stretching out like that; those tumbling ‘boils’ show a
dissolving bar and a changing channel there; the lines and circles in
the slick water over yonder are a warning that that troublesome place is
shoaling up dangerously; that silver streak in the shadow of the forest
is the ‘break’ from a new snag, and he has located himself in the very
best place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that tall dead
tree, with a single living branch, is not going to last long, and then
how is a body ever going to get through this blind place at night
without the friendly old landmark.</p>
<p>No, the romance and the beauty were all gone from the river. All the
value any feature of it had for me now was the amount of usefulness it
could furnish toward compassing the safe piloting of a steamboat. Since
those days, I have pitied doctors from my heart. What does the lovely
flush in a beauty’s cheek mean to a doctor but a ‘break’ that ripples
above some deadly disease. Are not all her visible charms sown thick
with what are to him the signs and symbols of hidden decay? Does he ever
see her beauty at all, or doesn’t he simply view her professionally, and
comment upon her unwholesome condition all to himself? And doesn’t he
sometimes wonder whether he has gained most or lost most by learning his
trade?</p>
