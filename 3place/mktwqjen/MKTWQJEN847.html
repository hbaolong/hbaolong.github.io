BOY AND THE MEXICAN PLUG</h4>
<p>“When did you come?“</p>
<p>“Arrived at sundown.“</p>
<p>“Where from?“</p>
<p>“Salt Lake.“</p>
<p>“Are you in the service?“</p>
<p>“No. Trade.“</p>
<p>“Pirate trade, I reckon.“</p>
<p>“What do you know about it?“</p>
<p>“I saw you when you came. I recognized your master. He is a bad sort.
Trap-robber, horse-thief, squaw-man, renegado–Hank Butters–I know him
very well. Stole you, didn’t he?“</p>
<p>“Well, it amounted to that.“</p>
<p>“I thought so. Where is his pard?“</p>
<p>“He stopped at White Cloud’s camp.“</p>
<p>“He is another of the same stripe, is Blake Haskins.“ (Aside.) They
are laying for Buffalo Bill again, I guess. (Aloud.) “What is your
name?“</p>
<p>“Which one?“</p>
<p>“Have you got more than one?“</p>
<p>“I get a new one every time I’m stolen. I used to have an honest
name, but that was early; I’ve forgotten it. Since then I’ve had
thirteen aliases.“</p>
<p>“Aliases? What is alias?“</p>
<p>“A false name.“</p>
<p>“Alias. It’s a fine large word, and is in my line; it has quite a
learned and cerebrospinal incandescent sound. Are you educated?“</p>
<p>“Well, no, I can’t claim it. I can take down bars, I can distinguish
oats from shoe-pegs, I can blaspheme a saddle-boil with the
college-bred, and I know a few other things–not many; I have had no
chance, I have always had to work; besides, I am of low birth and no
family. You speak my dialect like a native, but you are not a Mexican
Plug, you are a gentleman, I can see that; and educated, of course.“</p>
<p>“Yes, I am of old family, and not illiterate. I am a fossil.“</p>
<p>“A which?“</p>
<p>“Fossil. The first horses were fossils. They date back two million
years.“</p>
<p>“Gr-eat sand and sage-brush! do you mean it?“</p>
<p>“Yes, it is true. The bones of my ancestors are held in reverence and
worship, even by men. They do not leave them exposed to the weather when
they find them, but carry them three thousand miles and enshrine them in
their temples of learning, and worship them.“</p>
<p>“It is wonderful! I knew you must be a person of distinction, by your
fine presence and courtly address, and by the fact that you are not
subjected to the indignity of hobbles, like myself and the rest. Would
you tell me your name?“</p>
<p>“You have probably heard of it–Soldier Boy.“</p>
<p>“What!–the renowned, the illustrious?“</p>
<p>“Even so.“</p>
<p>“It takes my breath! Little did I dream that ever I should stand face
to face with the possessor of that great name. Buffalo Bill’s horse!
Known from the Canadian border to the deserts of Arizona, and from the
eastern marches of the Great Plains to the foot-hills of the Sierra!
Truly this is a memorable day. You still serve the celebrated Chief of
Scouts?“</p>
<p>“I am still his property, but he has lent me, for a time, to the most
noble, the most gracious, the most excellent, her Excellency Catherine,
Corporal-General Seventh Cavalry and Flag-Lieutenant Ninth Dragoons,
U.S.A.,–on whom be peace!“</p>
<p>“Amen. Did you say HER Excellency?“</p>
<p>“The same. A Spanish lady, sweet blossom of a ducal house. And truly
a wonder; knowing everything, capable of everything; speaking all the
languages, master of all sciences, a mind without horizons, a heart of
gold, the glory of her race! On whom be peace!“</p>
<p>“Amen. It is marvellous!“</p>
<p>“Verily. I knew many things, she has taught me others. I am educated.
I will tell you about her.“</p>
<p>“I listen–I am enchanted.“</p>
<p>“I will tell a plain tale, calmly, without excitement, without
eloquence. When she had been here four or five weeks she was already
erudite in military things, and they made her an officer–a double
officer. She rode the drill every day, like any soldier; and she could
take the bugle and direct the evolutions herself. Then, on a day, there
was a grand race, for prizes–none to enter but the children. Seventeen
children entered, and she was the youngest. Three girls, fourteen
boys–good riders all. It was a steeplechase, with four hurdles, all
pretty high. The first prize was a most cunning half-grown silver bugle,
and mighty pretty, with red silk cord and tassels. Buffalo Bill was very
anxious; for he had taught her to ride, and he did most dearly want her
to win that race, for the glory of it. So he wanted her to ride me, but
she wouldn’t; and she reproached him, and said it was unfair and
unright, and taking advantage; for what horse in this post or any other
could stand a chance against me? and she was very severe with him, and
said, ‘You ought to be ashamed–you are proposing to me conduct
unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.’ So he just tossed her up in the
air about thirty feet and caught her as she came down, and said he was
ashamed; and put up his handkerchief and pretended to cry, which nearly
broke her heart, and she petted him, and begged him to forgive her, and
said she would do anything in the world he could ask but that; but he
said he ought to go hang himself, and he MUST, if he could get a rope;
it was nothing but right he should, for he never, never could forgive
himself; and then SHE began to cry, and they both sobbed, the way you
could hear him a mile, and she clinging around his neck and pleading,
till at last he was comforted a little, and gave his solemn promise he
wouldn’t hang himself till after the race; and wouldn’t do it at all if
she won it, which made her happy, and she said she would win it or die
in the saddle; so then everything was pleasant again and both of them
content. He can’t help playing jokes on her, he is so fond of her and
she is so innocent and unsuspecting; and when she finds it out she cuffs
him and is in a fury, but presently forgives him because it’s him; and
maybe the very next day she’s caught with another joke; you see she
can’t learn any better, because she hasn’t any deceit in her, and that
kind aren’t ever expecting it in another person.</p>
<p>“It was a grand race. The whole post was there, and there was such
another whooping and shouting when the seventeen kids came flying down
the turf and sailing over the hurdles–oh, beautiful to see! Half-way
down, it was kind of neck and neck, and anybody’s race and nobody’s.
Then, what should happen but a cow steps out and puts her head down to
munch grass, with her broadside to the battalion, and they a-coming like
the wind; they split apart to flank her, but SHE?–why, she drove the
spurs home and soared over that cow like a bird! and on she went, and
cleared the last hurdle solitary and alone, the army letting loose the
grand yell, and she skipped from the horse the same as if he had been
standing still, and made her bow, and everybody crowded around to
congratulate, and they gave her the bugle, and she put it to her lips
and blew ‘boots and saddles’ to see how it would go, and BB was as proud
as you can’t think! And he said, ‘Take Soldier Boy, and don’t pass him
back till I ask for him!’ and I can tell you he wouldn’t have said that
to any other person on this planet. That was two months and more ago,
and nobody has been on my back since but the Corporal-General Seventh
Cavalry and Flag-Lieutenant of the Ninth Dragoons, U.S.A.,–on whom be
peace!“</p>
<p>“Amen. I listen–tell me more.“</p>
<p>“She set to work and organized the Sixteen, and called it the First
Battalion Rocky Mountain Rangers, U.S.A., and she wanted to be bugler,
but they elected her Lieutenant-General and Bugler. So she ranks her
uncle the commandant, who is only a Brigadier. And doesn’t she train
those little people! Ask the Indians, ask the traders, ask the soldiers;
they’ll tell you. She has been at it from the first day. Every morning
they go clattering down into the plain, and there she sits on my back
with her bugle at her mouth and sounds the orders and puts them through
the evolutions for an hour or more; and it is too beautiful for anything
to see those ponies dissolve from one formation into another, and waltz
about, and break, and scatter, and form again, always moving, always
graceful, now trotting, now galloping, and so on, sometimes near by,
sometimes in the distance, all just like a state ball, you know, and
sometimes she can’t hold herself any longer, but sounds the ‘charge,’
and turns me loose! and you can take my word for it, if the battalion
hasn’t too much of a start we catch up and go over the breastworks with
the front line.</p>
<p>“Yes, they are soldiers, those little people; and healthy, too, not
ailing any more, the way they used to be sometimes. It’s because of her
drill. She’s got a fort, now–Fort Fanny Marsh. Major-General Tommy Drake
planned it out, and the Seventh and Dragoons built it. Tommy is the
Colonel’s son, and is fifteen and the oldest in the Battalion; Fanny
Marsh is Brigadier-General, and is next oldest–over thirteen. She is
daughter of Captain Marsh, Company B, Seventh Cavalry.
Lieutenant-General Alison is the youngest by considerable; I think she
is about nine and a half or three-quarters. Her military rig, as
Lieutenant-General, isn’t for business, it’s for dress parade, because
the ladies made it. They say they got it out of the Middle Ages–out of a
book–and it is all red and blue and white silks and satins and velvets;
tights, trunks, sword, doublet with slashed sleeves, short cape, cap
with just one feather in it; I’ve heard them name these things; they got
them out of the book; she’s dressed like a page, of old times, they say.
It’s the daintiest outfit that ever was–you will say so, when you see
it. She’s lovely in it–oh, just a dream! In some ways she is just her
age, but in others she’s as old as her uncle, I think. She is very
learned. She teaches her uncle his book. I have seen her sitting by with
the book and reciting to him what is in it, so that he can learn to do
it himself.</p>
<p>“Every Saturday she hires little Injuns to garrison her fort; then
she lays siege to it, and makes military approaches by make-believe
trenches in make-believe night, and finally at make-believe dawn she
draws her sword and sounds the assault and takes it by storm. It is for
practice. And she has invented a bugle-call all by herself, out of her
own head, and it’s a stirring one, and the prettiest in the service.
It’s to call ME–it’s never used for anything else. She taught it to me,
and told me what it says: ‘IT IS I, SOLDIER–COME!’ and when those
thrilling notes come floating down the distance I hear them without
fail, even if I am two miles away; and then–oh, then you should see my
heels get down to business!</p>
<p>“And she has taught me how to say good-morning and good-night to her,
which is by lifting my right hoof for her to shake; and also how to say
good-bye; I do that with my left foot–but only for practice, because
there hasn’t been any but make-believe good-byeing yet, and I hope there
won’t ever be. It would make me cry if I ever had to put up my left foot
in earnest. She has taught me how to salute, and I can do it as well as
a soldier. I bow my head low, and lay my right hoof against my cheek.
She taught me that because I got into disgrace once, through ignorance.
I am privileged, because I am known to be honorable and trustworthy, and
because I have a distinguished record in the service; so they don’t
hobble me nor tie me to stakes or shut me tight in stables, but let me
wander around to suit myself. Well, trooping the colors is a very solemn
ceremony, and everybody must stand uncovered when the flag goes by, the
commandant and all; and once I was there, and ignorantly walked across
right in front of the band, which was an awful disgrace: Ah, the
Lieutenant-General was so ashamed, and so distressed that I should have
done such a thing before all the world, that she couldn’t keep the tears
back; and then she taught me the salute, so that if I ever did any other
unmilitary act through ignorance I could do my salute and she believed
everybody would think it was apology enough and would not press the
matter. It is very nice and distinguished; no other horse can do it;
often the men salute me, and I return it. I am privileged to be present
when the Rocky Mountain Rangers troop the colors and I stand solemn,
like the children, and I salute when the flag goes by. Of course when
she goes to her fort her sentries sing out ‘Turn out the guard!’ and
then . . . do you catch that refreshing early-morning whiff from the
mountain-pines and the wild flowers? The night is far spent; we’ll hear
the bugles before long. Dorcas, the black woman, is very good and nice;
she takes care of the Lieutenant-General, and is Brigadier-General
Alison’s mother, which makes her mother-in-law to the
Lieutenant-General. That is what Shekels says. At least it is what I
think he says, though I never can understand him quite clearly. He–“</p>
<p>“Who is Shekels?“</p>
<p>“The Seventh Cavalry dog. I mean, if he IS a dog. His father was a
coyote and his mother was a wild-cat. It doesn’t really make a dog out
of him, does it?“</p>
<p>“Not a real dog, I should think. Only a kind of a general dog, at
most, I reckon. Though this is a matter of ichthyology, I suppose; and
if it is, it is out of my depth, and so my opinion is not valuable, and
I don’t claim much consideration for it.“</p>
<p>“It isn’t ichthyology; it is dogmatics, which is still more difficult
and tangled up. Dogmatics always are.“</p>
<p>“Dogmatics is quite beyond me, quite; so I am not competing. But on
general principles it is my opinion that a colt out of a coyote and a
wild-cat is no square dog, but doubtful. That is my hand, and I stand
pat.“</p>
<p>“Well, it is as far as I can go myself, and be fair and
conscientious. I have always regarded him as a doubtful dog, and so has
Potter. Potter is the great Dane. Potter says he is no dog, and not even
poultry–though I do not go quite so far as that.</p>
<p>“And I wouldn’t, myself. Poultry is one of those things which no
person can get to the bottom of, there is so much of it and such
variety. It is just wings, and wings, and wings, till you are weary:
turkeys, and geese, and bats, and butterflies, and angels, and
grasshoppers, and flying-fish, and–well, there is really no end to the
tribe; it gives me the heaves just to think of it. But this one hasn’t
any wings, has he?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Well, then, in my belief he is more likely to be dog than poultry. I
have not heard of poultry that hadn’t wings. Wings is the SIGN of
poultry; it is what you tell poultry by. Look at the mosquito.“</p>
<p>“What do you reckon he is, then? He must be something.“</p>
<p>“Why, he could be a reptile; anything that hasn’t wings is a
reptile.“</p>
<p>“Who told you that?“</p>
<p>“Nobody told me, but I overheard it.“</p>
<p>“Where did you overhear it?“</p>
<p>“Years ago. I was with the Philadelphia Institute expedition in the
Bad Lands under Professor Cope, hunting mastodon bones, and I overheard
him say, his own self, that any plantigrade circumflex vertebrate
bacterium that hadn’t wings and was uncertain was a reptile. Well, then,
has this dog any wings? No. Is he a plantigrade circumflex vertebrate
bacterium? Maybe so, maybe not; but without ever having seen him, and
judging only by his illegal and spectacular parentage, I will bet the
odds of a bale of hay to a bran mash that he looks it. Finally, is he
uncertain? That is the point–is he uncertain? I will leave it to you if
you have ever heard of a more uncertainer dog than what this one
is?“</p>
<p>“No, I never have.“</p>
<p>“Well, then, he’s a reptile. That’s settled.“</p>
<p>“Why, look here, whatsyourname“</p>
<p>“Last alias, Mongrel.“</p>
<p>“A good one, too. I was going to say, you are better educated than
you have been pretending to be. I like cultured society, and I shall
cultivate your acquaintance. Now as to Shekels, whenever you want to
know about any private thing that is going on at this post or in White
Cloud’s camp or Thunder-Bird’s, he can tell you; and if you make friends
with him he’ll be glad to, for he is a born gossip, and picks up all the
tittle-tattle. Being the whole Seventh Cavalry’s reptile, he doesn’t
belong to anybody in particular, and hasn’t any military duties; so he
comes and goes as he pleases, and is popular with all the house cats and
other authentic sources of private information. He understands all the
languages, and talks them all, too. With an accent like gritting your
teeth, it is true, and with a grammar that is no improvement on
blasphemy–still, with practice you get at the meat of what he says, and
it serves. . . Hark! That’s the reveille. . . .</p>
<p>[THE REVEILLE]</p>
<p>“Faint and far, but isn’t it clear, isn’t it sweet? There’s no music
like the bugle to stir the blood, in the still solemnity of the morning
twilight, with the dim plain stretching away to nothing and the spectral
mountains slumbering against the sky. You’ll hear another note in a
minute–faint and far and clear, like the other one, and sweeter still,
you’ll notice. Wait . . . listen. There it goes! It says, ‘IT IS I,
SOLDIER–COME!’ . . .</p>
<p>[SOLDIER BOY’S BUGLE CALL]</p>
<p>. . . Now then, watch me leave a blue streak behind!“</p>
