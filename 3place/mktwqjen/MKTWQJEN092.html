<h4 id="chapter-xxvi.">CHAPTER XXVI.</h4>
<p>By and by I was smitten with the silver fever. “Prospecting parties“
were leaving for the mountains every day, and discovering and taking
possession of rich silver-bearing lodes and ledges of quartz. Plainly
this was the road to fortune. The great “Gould and Curry“ mine was held
at three or four hundred dollars a foot when we arrived; but in two
months it had sprung up to eight hundred. The “Ophir“ had been worth
only a mere trifle, a year gone by, and now it was selling at nearly
four thousand dollars a foot! Not a mine could be named that had not
experienced an astonishing advance in value within a short time.
Everybody was talking about these marvels. Go where you would, you heard
nothing else, from morning till far into the night. Tom So-and-So had
sold out of the “Amanda Smith“ for 0,000–hadn’t a cent when he “took up“
the ledge six months ago. John Jones had sold half his interest in the
“Bald Eagle and Mary Ann“ for 5,000, gold coin, and gone to the States
for his family. The widow Brewster had “struck it rich“ in the “Golden
Fleece“ and sold ten feet for 8,000–hadn’t money enough to buy a crape
bonnet when Sing-Sing Tommy killed her husband at Baldy Johnson’s wake
last spring. The “Last Chance“ had found a “clay casing“ and knew they
were “right on the ledge“–consequence, “feet“ that went begging
yesterday were worth a brick house apiece to-day, and seedy owners who
could not get trusted for a drink at any bar in the country yesterday
were roaring drunk on champagne to-day and had hosts of warm personal
friends in a town where they had forgotten how to bow or shake hands
from long-continued want of practice. Johnny Morgan, a common loafer,
had gone to sleep in the gutter and waked up worth a hundred thousand
dollars, in consequence of the decision in the “Lady Franklin and Rough
and Ready“ lawsuit. And so on–day in and day out the talk pelted our
ears and the excitement waxed hotter and hotter around us.</p>
<p>I would have been more or less than human if I had not gone mad like
the rest. Cart-loads of solid silver bricks, as large as pigs of lead,
were arriving from the mills every day, and such sights as that gave
substance to the wild talk about me. I succumbed and grew as frenzied as
the craziest.</p>
<p>Every few days news would come of the discovery of a bran-new mining
region; immediately the papers would teem with accounts of its richness,
and away the surplus population would scamper to take possession. By the
time I was fairly inoculated with the disease, “Esmeralda“ had just had
a run and “Humboldt“ was beginning to shriek for attention. “Humboldt!
Humboldt!“ was the new cry, and straightway Humboldt, the newest of the
new, the richest of the rich, the most marvellous of the marvellous
discoveries in silver-land was occupying two columns of the public
prints to “Esmeralda’s“ one. I was just on the point of starting to
Esmeralda, but turned with the tide and got ready for Humboldt. That the
reader may see what moved me, and what would as surely have moved him
had he been there, I insert here one of the newspaper letters of the
day. It and several other letters from the same calm hand were the main
means of converting me. I shall not garble the extract, but put it in
just as it appeared in the Daily Territorial Enterprise:</p>
<p>But what about our mines? I shall be candid with you. I shall express
an honest opinion, based upon a thorough examination. Humboldt county is
the richest mineral region upon God’s footstool. Each mountain range is
gorged with the precious ores. Humboldt is the true Golconda.</p>
<p>The other day an assay of mere croppings yielded exceeding four
thousand dollars to the ton. A week or two ago an assay of just such
surface developments made returns of seven thousand dollars to the ton.
Our mountains are full of rambling prospectors. Each day and almost
every hour reveals new and more startling evidences of the profuse and
intensified wealth of our favored county. The metal is not silver alone.
There are distinct ledges of auriferous ore. A late discovery plainly
evinces cinnabar. The coarser metals are in gross abundance. Lately
evidences of bituminous coal have been detected. My theory has ever been
that coal is a ligneous formation. I told Col. Whitman, in times past,
that the neighborhood of Dayton (Nevada) betrayed no present or previous
manifestations of a ligneous foundation, and that hence I had no
confidence in his lauded coal mines. I repeated the same doctrine to the
exultant coal discoverers of Humboldt. I talked with my friend Captain
Burch on the subject. My pyrhanism vanished upon his statement that in
the very region referred to he had seen petrified trees of the length of
two hundred feet. Then is the fact established that huge forests once
cast their grim shadows over this remote section. I am firm in the coal
faith.</p>
<p>Have no fears of the mineral resources of Humboldt county. They are
immense–incalculable.</p>
<p>Let me state one or two things which will help the reader to better
comprehend certain items in the above. At this time, our near neighbor,
Gold Hill, was the most successful silver mining locality in Nevada. It
was from there that more than half the daily shipments of silver bricks
came. “Very rich“ (and scarce) Gold Hill ore yielded from 00 to 00 to
the ton; but the usual yield was only 0 to 0 per ton–that is to say,
each hundred pounds of ore yielded from one dollar to two dollars. But
the reader will perceive by the above extract, that in Humboldt from one
fourth to nearly half the mass was silver! That is to say, every one
hundred pounds of the ore had from two hundred dollars up to about three
hundred and fifty in it. Some days later this same correspondent
wrote:</p>
<p>I have spoken of the vast and almost fabulous wealth of this
region–it is incredible. The intestines of our mountains are gorged with
precious ore to plethora. I have said that nature has so shaped our
mountains as to furnish most excellent facilities for the working of our
mines. I have also told you that the country about here is pregnant with
the finest mill sites in the world. But what is the mining history of
Humboldt? The Sheba mine is in the hands of energetic San Francisco
capitalists. It would seem that the ore is combined with metals that
render it difficult of reduction with our imperfect mountain machinery.
The proprietors have combined the capital and labor hinted at in my
exordium. They are toiling and probing. Their tunnel has reached the
length of one hundred feet. From primal assays alone, coupled with the
development of the mine and public confidence in the continuance of
effort, the stock had reared itself to eight hundred dollars market
value. I do not know that one ton of the ore has been converted into
current metal. I do know that there are many lodes in this section that
surpass the Sheba in primal assay value. Listen a moment to the
calculations of the Sheba operators. They purpose transporting the ore
concentrated to Europe. The conveyance from Star City (its locality) to
Virginia City will cost seventy dollars per ton; from Virginia to San
Francisco, forty dollars per ton; from thence to Liverpool, its
destination, ten dollars per ton. Their idea is that its conglomerate
metals will reimburse them their cost of original extraction, the price
of transportation, and the expense of reduction, and that then a ton of
the raw ore will net them twelve hundred dollars. The estimate may be
extravagant. Cut it in twain, and the product is enormous, far
transcending any previous developments of our racy Territory.</p>
<p>A very common calculation is that many of our mines will yield five
hundred dollars to the ton. Such fecundity throws the Gould andandandand
Curry, the Ophir and the Mexican, of your neighborhood, in the darkest
shadow. I have given you the estimate of the value of a single developed
mine. Its richness is indexed by its market valuation. The people of
Humboldt county are feet crazy. As I write, our towns are near deserted.
They look as languid as a consumptive girl. What has become of our
sinewy and athletic fellow-citizens? They are coursing through ravines
and over mountain tops. Their tracks are visible in every direction.
Occasionally a horseman will dash among us. His steed betrays hard
usage. He alights before his adobe dwelling, hastily exchanges
courtesies with his townsmen, hurries to an assay office and from thence
to the District Recorder’s. In the morning, having renewed his
provisional supplies, he is off again on his wild and unbeaten route.
Why, the fellow numbers already his feet by the thousands. He is the
horse-leech. He has the craving stomach of the shark or anaconda. He
would conquer metallic worlds.</p>
<p>This was enough. The instant we had finished reading the above
article, four of us decided to go to Humboldt. We commenced getting
ready at once. And we also commenced upbraiding ourselves for not
deciding sooner–for we were in terror lest all the rich mines would be
found and secured before we got there, and we might have to put up with
ledges that would not yield more than two or three hundred dollars a
ton, maybe. An hour before, I would have felt opulent if I had owned ten
feet in a Gold Hill mine whose ore produced twenty-five dollars to the
ton; now I was already annoyed at the prospect of having to put up with
mines the poorest of which would be a marvel in Gold Hill.</p>
