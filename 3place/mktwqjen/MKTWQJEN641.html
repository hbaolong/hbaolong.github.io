<h4 id="all-ready-to-condemn">4 All Ready to Condemn</h4>
<p>ON TUESDAY, the 20th of February, while I sat at my master’s work in
the evening, he came in, looking sad, and said it had been decided to
begin the trial at eight o’clock the next morning, and I must get ready
to assist him.</p>
<p>Of course I had been expecting such news every day for many days; but
no matter, the shock of it almost took my breath away and set me
trembling like a leaf. I suppose that without knowing it I had been half
imagining that at the last moment something would happen, something that
would stop this fatal trial; maybe that La Hire would burst in at the
gates with his hellions at his back; maybe that God would have pity and
stretch forth His mighty hand. But now–now there was no hope.</p>
<p>The trial was to begin in the chapel of the fortress and would be
public. So I went sorrowing away and told Noel, so that he might be
there early and secure a place. It would give him a chance to look again
upon the face which we so revered and which was so precious to us. All
the way, both going and coming, I plowed through chattering and
rejoicing multitudes of English soldiery and English-hearted French
citizens. There was no talk but of the coming event. Many times I heard
the remark, accompanied by a pitiless laugh:</p>
<p>“The fat Bishop has got things as he wants them at last, and says he
will lead the vile witch a merry dance and a short one.“</p>
<p>But here and there I glimpsed compassion and distress in a face, and
it was not always a French one. English soldiers feared Joan, but they
admired her for her great deeds and her unconquerable spirit.</p>
<p>In the morning Manchon and I went early, yet as we approached the
vast fortress we found crowds of men already there and still others
gathering. The chapel was already full and the way barred against
further admissions of unofficial persons. We took our appointed places.
Throned on high sat the president, Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, in his
grand robes, and before him in rows sat his robed court–fifty
distinguished ecclesiastics, men of high degree in the Church, of
clear-cut intellectual faces, men of deep learning, veteran adepts in
strategy and casuistry, practised setters of traps for ignorant minds
and unwary feet. When I looked around upon this army of masters of legal
fence, gathered here to find just one verdict and no other, and
remembered that Joan must fight for her good name and her life
single-handed against them, I asked myself what chance an ignorant poor
country-girl of nineteen could have in such an unequal conflict; and my
heart sank down low, very low. When I looked again at that obese
president, puffing and wheezing there, his great belly distending and
receding with each breath, and noted his three chins, fold above fold,
and his knobby and knotty face, and his purple and splotchy complexion,
and his repulsive cauliflower nose, and his cold and malignant eyes–a
brute, every detail of him–my heart sank lower still. And when I noted
that all were afraid of this man, and shrank and fidgeted in their seats
when his eye smote theirs, my last poor ray of hope dissolved away and
wholly disappeared.</p>
<p>There was one unoccupied seat in this place, and only one. It was
over against the wall, in view of every one. It was a little wooden
bench without a back, and it stood apart and solitary on a sort of dais.
Tall men-at-arms in morion, breastplate, and steel gauntlets stood as
stiff as their own halberds on each side of this dais, but no other
creature was near by it. A pathetic little bench to me it was, for I
knew whom it was for; and the sight of it carried my mind back to the
great court at Poitiers, where Joan sat upon one like it and calmly
fought her cunning fight with the astonished doctors of the Church and
Parliament, and rose from it victorious and applauded by all, and went
forth to fill the world with the glory of her name.</p>
<p>What a dainty little figure she was, and how gentle and innocent, how
winning and beautiful in the fresh bloom of her seventeen years! Those
were grand days. And so recent–for she was just nineteen now–and how
much she had seen since, and what wonders she had accomplished!</p>
<p>But now–oh, all was changed now. She had been languishing in
dungeons, away from light and air and the cheer of friendly faces, for
nearly three-quarters of a year–she, born child of the sun, natural
comrade of the birds and of all happy free creatures. She would be weary
now, and worn with this long captivity, her forces impaired; despondent,
perhaps, as knowing there was no hope. Yes, all was changed.</p>
<p>All this time there had been a muffled hum of conversation, and
rustling of robes and scraping of feet on the floor, a combination of
dull noises which filled all the place. Suddenly:</p>
<p>“Produce the accused!“</p>
<p>It made me catch my breath. My heart began to thump like a hammer.
But there was silence now–silence absolute. All those noises ceased, and
it was as if they had never been. Not a sound; the stillness grew
oppressive; it was like a weight upon one. All faces were turned toward
the door; and one could properly expect that, for most of the people
there suddenly realized, no doubt, that they were about to see, in
actual flesh and blood, what had been to them before only an embodied
prodigy, a word, a phrase, a world-girdling Name.</p>
<p>The stillness continued. Then, far down the stone-paved corridors,
one heard a vague slow sound approaching: clank . . . clink . . .
clank–Joan of Arc, Deliverer of France, in chains!</p>
<p>My head swam; all things whirled and spun about me. Ah, I was
realizing, too.</p>
