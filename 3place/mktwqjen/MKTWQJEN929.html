1891, TO HOWELLS, MRS. CLEMENS AND OTHERS. RETURN TO LITERATURE.
AMERICAN CLAIMANT. LEAVING HARTFORD. EUROPE. DOWN THE RHINE</h4>
<p>Clemens was still not without hope in the machine, at the beginning
of the new year (1891) but it was a hope no longer active, and it
presently became a moribund. Jones, on about the middle of February,
backed out altogether, laying the blame chiefly on Mackay and the
others, who, he said, had decided not to invest. Jones “let his victim
down easy“ with friendly words, but it was the end, for the present, at
least, of machine financiering.</p>
<p>It was also the end of Mark Twain’s capital. His publishing business
was not good. It was already in debt and needing more money. There was
just one thing for him to do and he did it at once, not stopping to cry
over spilt milk, but with good courage and the old enthusiasm that never
failed him, he returned to the trade of authorship. He dug out
half-finished articles and stories, finished them and sold them, and
within a week after the Jones collapse he was at work on a novel based
an the old Sellers idea, which eight years before he and Howells had
worked into a play. The brief letter in which he reported this news to
Howells bears no marks of depression, though the writer of it was in his
fifty-sixth year; he was by no means well, and his financial prospects
were anything but golden.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Feb. 24, ’91 DEAR HOWELLS,–Mrs. Clemens has been sick abed
for near two weeks, but is up and around the room now, and gaining. I
don’t know whether she has written Mrs. Howells or not–I only know she
was going to–and will yet, if she hasn’t. We are promising ourselves a
whole world of pleasure in the visit, and you mustn’t dream of
disappointing us.</p>
<p>Does this item stir an interest in you? Began a novel four days ago,
and this moment finished chapter four. Title of the book</p>
<p>“Colonel Mulberry Sellers. American Claimant Of the Great Earldom of
Rossmore’ in the Peerage of Great Britain.“</p>
<p>Ys Ever MARK.</p>
<p>Probably Mark Twain did not return to literary work reluctantly. He
had always enjoyed writing and felt now that he was equipped better than
ever for authorship, at least so far as material was concerned. There
exists a fragmentary copy of a letter to some unknown correspondent, in
which he recites his qualifications. It bears evidence of having been
written just at this time and is of unusual interest at this point.</p>
<p>Fragment of Letter to ——-, 1891:</p>
<p>. . . . I confine myself to life with which I am familiar when
pretending to portray life. But I confined myself to the boy-life out on
the Mississippi because that had a peculiar charm for me, and not
because I was not familiar with other phases of life. I was a soldier
two weeks once in the beginning of the war, and was hunted like a rat
the whole time. Familiar? My splendid Kipling himself hasn’t a more
burnt-in, hard-baked, and unforgetable familiarity with that
death-on-the-pale- horse-with-hell-following-after, which is a raw
soldier’s first fortnight in the field–and which, without any doubt, is
the most tremendous fortnight and the vividest he is ever going to
see.</p>
<p>Yes, and I have shoveled silver tailings in a quartz-mill a couple of
weeks, and acquired the last possibilities of culture in that direction.
And I’ve done “pocket-mining“ during three months in the one little
patch of ground in the whole globe where Nature conceals gold in
pockets–or did before we robbed all of those pockets and exhausted,
obliterated, annihilated the most curious freak Nature ever indulged in.
There are not thirty men left alive who, being told there was a pocket
hidden on the broad slope of a mountain, would know how to go and find
it, or have even the faintest idea of how to set about it; but I am one
of the possible 20 or 30 who possess the secret, and I could go and put
my hand on that hidden treasure with a most deadly precision.</p>
<p>And I’ve been a prospector, and know pay rock from poor when I find
it –just with a touch of the tongue. And I’ve been a silver miner and
know how to dig and shovel and drill and put in a blast. And so I know
the mines and the miners interiorly as well as Bret Harte knows them
exteriorly.</p>
<p>And I was a newspaper reporter four years in cities, and so saw the
inside of many things; and was reporter in a legislature two sessions
and the same in Congress one session, and thus learned to know
personally three sample bodies of the smallest minds and the selfishest
souls and the cowardliest hearts that God makes.</p>
<p>And I was some years a Mississippi pilot, and familiarly knew all the
different kinds of steam-boatmen–a race apart, and not like other
folk.</p>
<p>And I was for some years a traveling “jour“ printer, and wandered
from city to city–and so I know that sect familiarly.</p>
<p>And I was a lecturer on the public platform a number of seasons and
was a responder to toasts at all the different kinds of banquets–and so
I know a great many secrets about audiences–secrets not to be got out of
books, but only acquirable by experience.</p>
<p>And I watched over one dear project of mine for years, spent a
fortune on it, and failed to make it go–and the history of that would
make a large book in which a million men would see themselves as in a
mirror; and they would testify and say, Verily, this is not imagination;
this fellow has been there–and after would cast dust upon their heads,
cursing and blaspheming.</p>
<p>And I am a publisher, and did pay to one author’s widow (General
Grant’s) the largest copyright checks this world has seen–aggregating
more than L80,000 in the first year.</p>
<p>And I have been an author for 20 years and an ass for 55.</p>
<p>Now then; as the most valuable capital or culture or education usable
in the building of novels is personal experience I ought to be well
equipped for that trade.</p>
<p>I surely have the equipment, a wide culture, and all of it real, none
of it artificial, for I don’t know anything about books.</p>
<p>[No signature.]</p>
<p>Clemens for several years had been bothered by rheumatism in his
shoulder. The return now to the steady use of the pen aggravated his
trouble, and at times he was nearly disabled. The phonograph for
commercial dictation had been tried experimentally, and Mark Twain was
always ready for any innovation.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Feb. 28, ’91. DEAR HOWELLS,–Won’t you drop-in at the
Boylston Building (New England Phonograph Co) and talk into a phonograph
in an ordinary conversation-voice and see if another person (who didn’t
hear you do it) can take the words from the thing without difficulty and
repeat them to you. If the experiment is satisfactory (also make
somebody put in a message which you don’t hear, and see if afterward you
can get it out without difficulty) won’t you then ask them on what terms
they will rent me a phonograph for 3 months and furnish me cylinders
enough to carry 75,000 words. 175 cylinders, ain’t it?</p>
<p>I don’t want to erase any of them. My right arm is nearly disabled by
rheumatism, but I am bound to write this book (and sell 100,000 copies
of it–no, I mean a million–next fall) I feel sure I can dictate the book
into a phonograph if I don’t have to yell. I write 2,000 words a day; I
think I can dictate twice as many.</p>
<p>But mind, if this is going to be too much trouble to you–go ahead and
do it, all the same. Ys ever MARK.</p>
<p>Howells, always willing to help, visited the phonograph place, and a
few days later reported results. He wrote: “I talked your letter into a
fonograf in my usual tone at my usual gait of speech. Then the fonograf
man talked his answer in at his wonted swing and swell. Then we took the
cylinder to a type-writer in the next room, and she put the hooks into
her ears and wrote the whole out. I send you the result. There is a
mistake of one word. I think that if you have the cheek to dictate the
story into the fonograf, all the rest is perfectly easy. It wouldn’t
fatigue me to talk for an hour as I did.“</p>
<p>Clemens did not find the phonograph entirely satisfactory, at least
not for a time, and he appears never to have used it steadily. His early
experience with it, however, seems interesting.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Apl. 4, ’91. DEAR HOWELLS,–I’m ashamed. It happened in this
way. I was proposing to acknowledge the receipt of the play and the
little book per phonograph, so that you could see that the instrument is
good enough for mere letter-writing; then I meant to add the fact that
you can’t write literature with it, because it hasn’t any ideas and it
hasn’t any gift for elaboration, or smartness of talk, or vigor of
action, or felicity of expression, but is just matter-of-fact,
compressive, unornamental, and as grave and unsmiling as the devil.</p>
<p>I filled four dozen cylinders in two sittings, then found I could
have said about as much with the pen and said it a deal better. Then I
resigned.</p>
<p>I believe it could teach one to dictate literature to a
phonographer–and some time I will experiment in that line.</p>
<p>The little book is charmingly written, and it interested me. But it
flies too high for me. Its concretest things are filmy abstractions to
me, and when I lay my grip on one of them and open my hand, I feel as
embarrassed as I use to feel when I thought I had caught a fly. I’m
going to try to mail it back to you to-day–I mean I am going to charge
my memory. Charging my memory is one of my chief industries ….</p>
<p>With our loves and our kindest regards distributed among you
according to the proprieties. Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>P. S.–I’m sending that ancient “Mental Telegraphy“ article to
Harper’s –with a modest postscript. Probably read it to you years ago.
S. L. C.</p>
<p>The “little book“ mentioned in this letter was by Swedenborg, an
author in whom the Boston literary set was always deeply interested.
“Mental Telegraphy“ appeared in Harper’s Magazine, and is now included
in the Uniform Edition of Mark Twain’s books. It was written in
1878.</p>
<p>Joe Goodman had long since returned to California, it being clear
that nothing could be gained by remaining in Washington. On receipt of
the news of the type-setter’s collapse he sent a consoling word. Perhaps
he thought Clemens would rage over the unhappy circumstance, and
possibly hold him in some measure to blame. But it was generally the
smaller annoyances of life that made Mark Twain rage; the larger
catastrophes were likely to stir only his philosophy.</p>
<p>The Library of American Literature, mentioned in the following
letter, was a work in many volumes, edited by Edmund Clarence Stedman
and Ellen Mackay Hutchinson.</p>
<p>To Joe T. Goodman:</p>
<p>April [?] 1891. DEAR JOE, Well, it’s all right, anyway. Diplomacy
couldn’t have saved it–diplomacy of mine–at that late day. I hadn’t any
diplomacy in stock, anyway. In order to meet Jones’s requirements I had
to surrender the old contract (a contract which made me boss of the
situation and gave me the whip-hand of Paige) and allow the new one to
be drafted and put in its place. I was running an immense risk, but it
was justified by Jones’s promises–promises made to me not merely once
but every time I tallied with him. When February arrived, I saw signs
which were mighty plain reading. Signs which meant that Paige was hoping
and praying that Jones would go back on me–which would leave Paige boss,
and me robbed and out in the cold. His prayers were answered, and I am
out in the cold. If I ever get back my nine-twentieths interest, it will
be by law-suit–which will be instituted in the indefinite future, when
the time comes.</p>
<p>I am at work again–on a book. Not with a great deal of spirit, but
with enough–yes, plenty. And I am pushing my publishing house. It has
turned the corner after cleaning 0,000 a year for three consecutive
years, and piling every cent of it into one book–Library of American
Literature–and from next January onward it will resume dividends. But
I’ve got to earn 0,000 for it between now and then–which I will do if I
keep my health. This additional capital is needed for that same book,
because its prosperity is growing so great and exacting.</p>
<p>It is dreadful to think of you in ill health–I can’t realize it; you
are always to me the same that you were in those days when matchless
health. and glowing spirits and delight in life were commonplaces with
us. Lord save us all from old age and broken health and a hope-tree that
has lost the faculty of putting out blossoms.</p>
<p>With love to you both from us all. MARK.</p>
<p>Mark Twain’s residence in Hartford was drawing rapidly to a close.
Mrs. Clemens was poorly, and his own health was uncertain. They believed
that some of the European baths would help them. Furthermore, Mark Twain
could no longer afford the luxury of his Hartford home. In Europe life
could be simpler and vastly cheaper. He was offered a thousand dollars
apiece for six European letters, by the McClure syndicate and W. M.
Laffan, of the Sun. This would at least give him a start on the other
side. The family began immediately their sad arrangements for
departure.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall (manager Chas. L. Webster andandandand Co.), N.
Y.:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Apl. 14, ’91. DEAR MR. HALL,–Privately–keep it to
yourself–as you, are already aware, we are going to Europe in June, for
an indefinite stay. We shall sell the horses and shut up the house. We
wish to provide a place for our coachman, who has been with us a 21
years, and is sober, active, diligent, and unusually bright and capable.
You spoke of hiring a colored man as engineer and helper in the packing
room. Patrick would soon learn that trade and be very valuable. We will
cease to need him by the middle or end of June. Have you made
irrevocable arrangements with the colored man, or would you prefer to
have Patrick, if he thinks he would like to try?</p>
<p>I have not said anything to him about it yet.</p>
<p>Yours S. L. C.</p>
<p>It was to be a complete breaking up of their beautiful establishment.
Patrick McAleer, George the butler, and others of their household help
had been like members of the family. We may guess at the heartbreak of
it all, even though the letters remain cheerful.</p>
<p>Howells, strangely enough, seems to have been about the last one to
be told of their European plans; in fact, he first got wind of it from
the papers, and wrote for information. Likely enough Clemens had not
until then had the courage to confess.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, May 20, ’91. DEAR HOWELLS,–For her health’s sake
Mrs. Clemens must try baths somewhere, and this it is that has
determined us to go to Europe. The water required seems to be provided
at a little obscure and little-visited nook up in the hills back of the
Rhine somewhere and you get to it by Rhine traffic-boat and country
stage-coach. Come, get “sick or sorry enough“ and join us. We shall be a
little while at that bath, and the rest of the summer at Annecy (this
confidential to you) in Haute Savoie, 22 miles from Geneva. Spend the
winters in Berlin. I don’t know how long we shall be in Europe–I have a
vote, but I don’t cast it. I’m going to do whatever the others desire,
with leave to change their mind, without prejudice, whenever they want
to. Travel has no longer, any charm for me. I have seen all the foreign
countries I want to see except heaven and hell, and I have only a vague
curiosity as concerns one of those.</p>
<p>I found I couldn’t use the play–I had departed too far from its lines
when I came to look at it. I thought I might get a great deal of
dialogue out of it, but I got only 15 loosely written pages–they saved
me half a days work. It was the cursing phonograph. There was abundance
of good dialogue, but it couldn’t befitted into the new conditions of
the story.</p>
<p>Oh, look here–I did to-day what I have several times in past years
thought of doing: answered an interviewing proposition from a rich
newspaper with the reminder that they had not stated the terms; that my
time was all occupied with writing, at good pay, and that as talking was
harder work I should not care to venture it unless I knew the pay was
going to be proportionately higher. I wish I had thought of this the
other day when Charley Stoddard turned a pleasant Englishman loose on me
and I couldn’t think of any rational excuse. Ys Ever MARK.</p>
<p>Clemens had finished his Sellers book and had disposed of the serial
rights to the McClure syndicate. The house in Hartford was closed early
in June, and on the 6th the family, with one maid, Katie Leary, sailed
on the Gascogne. Two weeks later they had begun a residence abroad which
was to last for more than nine years.</p>
<p>It was not easy to get to work in Europe. Clemens’s arm remained
lame, and any effort at writing brought suffering. The Century Magazine
proposed another set of letters, but by the end of July he had barely
begun on those promised to McClure and Laffan. In August, however, he
was able to send three: one from Aix about the baths there, another from
Bayreuth concerning the Wagner festival, and a third from Marienbad, in
Bohemia, where they rested for a time. He decided that he would arrange
for no more European letters when the six were finished, but would
gather material for a book. He would take a courier and a kodak and go
tramping again in some fashion that would be interesting to do and to
write.</p>
<p>The idea finally matured when he reached Switzerland and settled the
family at the Hotel Beau Rivage, Ouchy, Lausanne, facing Lake Leman. He
decided to make a floating trip down the Rhone, and he engaged Joseph
Very, a courier that had served him on a former European trip, to
accompany him. The courier went over to Bourget and bought for five
dollars a flat-bottomed boat and engaged its owner as their pilot. It
was the morning of September 20, when they began their floating-trip
down the beautiful historic river that flows through the loveliest and
most romantic region of France. He wrote daily to Mrs. Clemens, and his
letters tell the story of that drowsy, happy experience better than the
notes made with a view to publication. Clemens had arrived at Lake
Bourget on the evening before the morning of their start and slept on
the Island of Chatillon, in an old castle of the same name. Lake Bourget
connects with the Rhone by a small canal.</p>
