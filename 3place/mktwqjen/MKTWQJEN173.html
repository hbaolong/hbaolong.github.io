<h4 id="chapter-xxx.">CHAPTER XXX.</h4>
<p>Once more Louise had good news from her Washington–Senator Dilworthy
was going to sell the Tennessee Land to the government! Louise told
Laura in confidence. She had told her parents, too, and also several
bosom friends; but all of these people had simply looked sad when they
heard the news, except Laura. Laura’s face suddenly brightened under
it–only for an instant, it is true, but poor Louise was grateful for
even that fleeting ray of encouragement. When next Laura was alone, she
fell into a train of thought something like this:</p>
<p>“If the Senator has really taken hold of this matter, I may look for
that invitation to his house at, any moment. I am perishing to go! I do
long to know whether I am only simply a large-sized pigmy among these
pigmies here, who tumble over so easily when one strikes them, or
whether I am really–.“ Her thoughts drifted into other channels, for a
season. Then she continued:– “He said I could be useful in the great
cause of philanthropy, and help in the blessed work of uplifting the
poor and the ignorant, if he found it feasible to take hold of our Land.
Well, that is neither here nor there; what I want, is to go to
Washington and find out what I am. I want money, too; and if one may
judge by what she hears, there are chances there for a–.“ For a
fascinating woman, she was going to say, perhaps, but she did not.</p>
<p>Along in the fall the invitation came, sure enough. It came
officially through brother Washington, the private Secretary, who
appended a postscript that was brimming with delight over the prospect
of seeing the Duchess again. He said it would be happiness enough to
look upon her face once more–it would be almost too much happiness when
to it was added the fact that she would bring messages with her that
were fresh from Louise’s lips.</p>
<p>In Washington’s letter were several important enclosures. For
instance, there was the Senator’s check for ,000–“to buy suitable
clothing in New York with!“ It was a loan to be refunded when the Land
was sold. Two thousand–this was fine indeed. Louise’s father was called
rich, but Laura doubted if Louise had ever had 00 worth of new clothing
at one time in her life. With the check came two through tickets–good on
the railroad from Hawkeye to Washington via New York–and they were
“dead-head“ tickets, too, which had been given to Senator Dilworthy by
the railway companies. Senators and representatives were paid thousands
of dollars by the government for traveling expenses, but they always
traveled “deadhead“ both ways, and then did as any honorable,
high-minded men would naturally do–declined to receive the mileage
tendered them by the government. The Senator had plenty of railway
passes, and could. easily spare two to Laura–one for herself and one for
a male escort. Washington suggested that she get some old friend of the
family to come with her, and said the Senator would “deadhead“ him home
again as soon as he had grown tired, of the sights of the capital. Laura
thought the thing over. At first she was pleased with the idea, but
presently she began to feel differently about it. Finally she said, “No,
our staid, steady-going Hawkeye friends’ notions and mine differ about
some things –they respect me, now, and I respect them–better leave it
so–I will go alone; I am not afraid to travel by myself.“ And so
communing with herself, she left the house for an afternoon walk.</p>
<p>Almost at the door she met Col. Sellers. She told him about her
invitation to Washington.</p>
<p>“Bless me!“ said the Colonel. “I have about made up my mind to go
there myself. You see we’ve got to get another appropriation through,
and the Company want me to come east and put it through Congress.
Harry’s there, and he’ll do what he can, of course; and Harry’s a good
fellow and always does the very best he knows how, but then he’s
young–rather young for some parts of such work, you know–and besides he
talks too much, talks a good deal too much; and sometimes he appears to
be a little bit visionary, too, I think the worst thing in the world for
a business man. A man like that always exposes his cards, sooner or
later. This sort of thing wants an old, quiet, steady hand–wants an old
cool head, you know, that knows men, through and through, and is used to
large operations. I’m expecting my salary, and also some dividends from
the company, and if they get along in time, I’ll go along with you
Laura–take you under my wing–you mustn’t travel alone. Lord I wish I had
the money right now. –But there’ll be plenty soon–plenty.“</p>
<p>Laura reasoned with herself that if the kindly, simple-hearted
Colonel was going anyhow, what could she gain by traveling alone and
throwing away his company? So she told him she accepted his offer
gladly, gratefully. She said it would be the greatest of favors if he
would go with her and protect her–not at his own expense as far as
railway fares were concerned, of course; she could not expect him to put
himself to so much trouble for her and pay his fare besides. But he
wouldn’t hear of her paying his fare–it would be only a pleasure to him
to serve her. Laura insisted on furnishing the tickets; and finally,
when argument failed, she said the tickets cost neither her nor any one
else a cent –she had two of them–she needed but one–and if he would not
take the other she would not go with him. That settled the matter. He
took the ticket. Laura was glad that she had the check for new clothing,
for she felt very certain of being able to get the Colonel to borrow a
little of the money to pay hotel bills with, here and there.</p>
<p>She wrote Washington to look for her and Col. Sellers toward the end
of November; and at about the time set the two travelers arrived safe in
the capital of the nation, sure enough.</p>
