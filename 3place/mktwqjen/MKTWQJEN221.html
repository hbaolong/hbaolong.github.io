<h4 id="chapter-iii.">CHAPTER III.</h4>
<p>THE PLOT THICKENS.</p>
<p>Few months drifted by. All men published the praises of the young
Conrad’s government and extolled the wisdom of his judgments, the
mercifulness of his sentences, and the modesty with which he bore
himself in his great office. The old Duke soon gave everything into his
hands, and sat apart and listened with proud satisfaction while his heir
delivered the decrees of the crown from the seat of the premier. It
seemed plain that one so loved and praised and honored of all men as
Conrad was, could not be otherwise than happy. But strange enough, he
was not. For he saw with dismay that the Princess Constance had begun to
love him! The love of, the rest of the world was happy fortune for him,
but this was freighted with danger! And he saw, moreover, that the
delighted Duke had discovered his daughter’s passion likewise, and was
already dreaming of a marriage. Every day somewhat of the deep sadness
that had been in the princess’ face faded away; every day hope and
animation beamed brighter from her eye; and by and by even vagrant
smiles visited the face that had been so troubled.</p>
<p>Conrad was appalled. He bitterly cursed himself for having yielded to
the instinct that had made him seek the companionship of one of his own
sex when he was new and a stranger in the palace–when he was sorrowful
and yearned for a sympathy such as only women can give or feel. He now
began to avoid, his cousin. But this only made matters worse, for,
naturally enough, the more he avoided her, the more she cast herself in
his way. He marveled at this at first; and next it startled him. The
girl haunted him; she hunted him; she happened upon him at all times and
in all places, in the night as well as in the day. She seemed singularly
anxious. There was surely a mystery somewhere.</p>
<p>This could not go on forever. All the world was talking about it. The
Duke was beginning to look perplexed. Poor Conrad was becoming a very
ghost through dread and dire distress. One day as he was emerging from a
private ante-room attached to the picture gallery, Constance confronted
him, and seizing both his hands, in hers, exclaimed:</p>
<p>“Oh, why, do you avoid me? What have I done–what have I said, to lose
your kind opinion of me–for, surely I had it once? Conrad, do not
despise me, but pity a tortured heart? I cannot,–cannot hold the words
unspoken longer, lest they kill me–I LOVE you, CONRAD! There, despise me
if you must, but they would be uttered!“</p>
<p>Conrad was speechless. Constance hesitated a moment, and then,
misinterpreting his silence, a wild gladness flamed in her eyes, and she
flung her arms about his neck and said:</p>
<p>“You relent! you relent! You can love me–you will love me! Oh, say
you will, my own, my worshipped Conrad!’“</p>
<p>“Conrad groaned aloud. A sickly pallor overspread his countenance,
and he trembled like an aspen. Presently, in desperation, he thrust the
poor girl from him, and cried:</p>
<p>“You know not what you ask! It is forever and ever impossible!“ And
then he fled like a criminal and left the princess stupefied with
amazement. A minute afterward she was crying and sobbing there, and
Conrad was crying and sobbing in his chamber. Both were in despair. Both
save ruin staring them in the face.</p>
<p>By and by Constance rose slowly to her feet and moved away,
saying:</p>
<p>“To think that he was despising my love at the very moment that I
thought it was melting his cruel heart! I hate him! He spurned me–did
this man–he spurned me from him like a dog!“</p>
