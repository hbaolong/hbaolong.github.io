<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>It is often said in print that Mrs. Eddy claims that God was the
Author of Science and Health. Mr. Peabody states in his pamphlet that
“she says not she but God was the Author.“ I cannot find that in her
autobiography she makes this transference of the authorship, but I think
that in it she definitely claims that she did her work under His
inspiration–definitely for her; for as a rule she is not a very definite
person, even when she seems to be trying her best to be clear and
positive. Speaking of the early days when her Science was beginning to
unfold itself and gather form in her mind, she says (Autobiography, page
43):</p>
<p>“The divine hand led me into a new world of light and Life, a fresh
universe–old to God, but new to His ‘little one.’“</p>
<p>She being His little one, as I understand it.</p>
<p>The divine hand led her. It seems to mean “God inspired me“; but when
a person uses metaphors instead of statistics–and that is Mrs. Eddy’s
common fashion–one cannot always feel sure about the intention.</p>
<p>[Page 56.] “Even the Scripture gave no direct interpretation of the
Scientific basis for demonstrating the spiritual Principle of healing,
until our Heavenly Father saw fit, through the Key to the Scriptures, in
Science and Health, to unlock this ‘mystery of godliness.’“</p>
<p>Another baffling metaphor. If she had used plain forecastle English,
and said “God wrote the Key and I put it in my book“; or if she had said
“God furnished me the solution of the mystery and I put it on paper“; or
if she had said “God did it all,“ then we should understand; but her
phrase is open to any and all of those translations, and is a Key which
unlocks nothing–for us. However, it seems to at least mean “God inspired
me,“ if nothing more.</p>
<p>There was personal and intimate communion, at any rate we get that
much out of the riddles. The connection extended to business, after the
establishment of the teaching and healing industry.</p>
<p>[Page 71.] “When God impelled me to set a price on my instruction,“
etc. Further down: “God has since shown me, in multitudinous ways, the
wisdom of this decision.“</p>
<p>She was not able to think of a “financial equivalent“–meaning a
pecuniary equivalent–for her “instruction in Christian Science
Mind-healing.“ In this emergency she was “led“ to charge three hundred
dollars for a term of “twelve half-days.“ She does not say who led her,
she only says that the amount greatly troubled her. I think it means
that the price was suggested from above, “led“ being a theological term
identical with our commercial phrase “personally conducted.“ She “shrank
from asking it, but was finally led, by a strange providence, to accept
this fee.“ “Providence“ is another theological term. Two leds and a
providence, taken together, make a pretty strong argument for
inspiration. I think that these statistics make it clear that the price
was arranged above. This view is constructively supported by the fact,
already quoted, that God afterwards approved, “in multitudinous ways,“
her wisdom in accepting the mentioned fee. “Multitudinous ways“
–multitudinous encoring–suggests enthusiasm. Business enthusiasm. And it
suggests nearness. God’s nearness to his “little one.“ Nearness, and a
watchful personal interest. A warm, palpitating, Standard-Oil interest,
so to speak. All this indicates inspiration. We may assume, then, two
inspirations: one for the book, the other for the business.</p>
<p>The evidence for inspiration is further augmented by the testimony of
Rev. George Tomkins, D.D., already quoted, that Mrs. Eddy and her book
were foretold in Revelation, and that Mrs. Eddy “is God’s brightest
thought to this age, giving us the spiritual interpretation of the Bible
in the ‘little book’“ of the Angel.</p>
<p>I am aware that it is not Mr. Tomkins that is speaking, but
Mrs. Eddy. The commissioned lecturers of the Christian Science Church
have to be members of the Board of Lectureship. (By-laws Sec. 2, p. 70.)
The Board of Lectureship is selected by the Board of Directors of the
Church. (By-laws, Sec. 3, p. 70.) The Board of Directors of the Church
is the property of Mrs. Eddy. (By-laws, p. 22.) Mr. Tomkins did not make
that statement without authorization from headquarters. He necessarily
got it from the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors from
Mrs. Eddy, Mrs. Eddy from the Deity. Mr. Tomkins would have been turned
down by that procession if his remarks had been unsatisfactory to
it.</p>
<p>It may be that there is evidence somewhere–as has been claimed–that
Mrs. Eddy has charged upon the Deity the verbal authorship of Science
and Health. But if she ever made the charge, she has withdrawn it (as it
seems to me), and in the most formal and unqualified; of all ways. See
Autobiography, page 57:</p>
<p>“When the demand for this book increased . . . the copyright was
infringed. I entered a suit at Law, and my copyright was protected.“</p>
<p>Thus it is plain that she did not plead that the Deity was the
(verbal) Author; for if she had done that, she would have lost her
case–and with rude promptness. It was in the old days before the Berne
Convention and before the passage of our amended law of 1891, and the
court would have quoted the following stern clause from the existing
statute and frowned her out of the place:</p>
<p>“No Foreigner can acquire copyright in the United States.“</p>
<p>To sum up. The evidence before me indicates three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>That Mrs. Eddy claims the verbal author ship for herself. 2. That
she denies it to the Deity. 3. That–in her belief–she wrote the book
under the inspiration of the Deity, but furnished the language
herself.</li>
</ol>
<p>In one place in the Autobiography she claims both the language and
the ideas; but when this witness is testifying, one must draw the line
somewhere, or she will prove both sides of her case-nine sides, if
desired.</p>
<p>It is too true. Much too true. Many, many times too true. She is a
most trying witness–the most trying witness that ever kissed the Book, I
am sure. There is no keeping up with her erratic testimony. As soon as
you have got her share of the authorship nailed where you half hope and
half believe it will stay and cannot be joggled loose any more, she
joggles it loose again–or seems to; you cannot be sure, for her habit of
dealing in meaningless metaphors instead of in plain, straightforward
statistics, makes it nearly always impossible to tell just what it is
she is trying to say. She was definite when she claimed both the
language and the ideas of the book. That seemed to settle the matter. It
seemed to distribute the percentages of credit with precision between
the collaborators: ninety-two per cent. to Mrs. Eddy, who did all the
work, and eight per cent. to the Deity, who furnished the inspiration
not enough of it to damage the copyright in a country closed against
Foreigners, and yet plenty to advertise the book and market it at famine
rates. Then Mrs. Eddy does not keep still, but fetches around and comes
forward and testifies again. It is most injudicious. For she resorts to
metaphor this time, and it makes trouble, for she seems to reverse the
percentages and claim only the eight per cent. for her self. I quote
from Mr. Peabody’s book (Eddyism, or Christian Science. Boston: 15 Court
Square, price twenty-five cents):</p>
<p>“Speaking of this book, Mrs. Eddy, in January last (1901) said: ‘I
should blush to write of Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures,
as I have, were it of human origin, and I, apart from God, its author;
but as I was only a scribe echoing the harmonies of Heaven in divine
metaphysics, I cannot be supermodest of the Christian Science
text-book.“’</p>
<p>Mr. Peabody’s comment:</p>
<p>“Nothing could be plainer than that. Here is a distinct avowal that
the book entitled Science and Health was the work of Almighty God.“</p>
<p>It does seem to amount to that. She was only a “scribe.“ Confound the
word, it is just a confusion, it has no determinable meaning there, it
leaves us in the air. A scribe is merely a person who writes. He may be
a copyist, he may be an amanuensis, he may be a writer of originals, and
furnish both the language and the ideas. As usual with Mrs. Eddy, the
connection affords no help–“echoing“ throws no light upon “scribe.“ A
rock can reflect an echo, a wall can do it, a mountain can do it, many
things can do it, but a scribe can’t. A scribe that could reflect an
echo could get over thirty dollars a week in a side-show. Many
impresarios would rather have him than a cow with four tails. If we
allow that this present scribe was setting down the “harmonies of
Heaven“–and certainly that seems to have been the case then there was
only one way to do it that I can think of: listen to the music and put
down the notes one after another as they fell. In that case Mrs. Eddy
did not invent the tune, she only entered it on paper. Therefore
dropping the metaphor–she was merely an amanuensis, and furnished
neither the language of Science and Health nor the ideas. It reduces her
to eight per cent. (and the dividends on that and the rest).</p>
<p>Is that it? We shall never know. For Mrs. Eddy is liable to testify
again at any time. But until she does it, I think we must conclude that
the Deity was Author of the whole book, and Mrs. Eddy merely His
telephone and stenographer. Granting this, her claim as the Voice of God
stands-for the present–justified and established.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPT</p>
<p>I overlooked something. It appears that there was more of that
utterance than Mr. Peabody has quoted in the above paragraph. It will be
found in Mrs. Eddy’s organ, the Christian Science Journal (January,
1901) and reads as follows:</p>
<p>“It was not myself . . . which dictated Science and Health, with Key
to the Scriptures.“</p>
<p>That is certainly clear enough. The words which I have removed from
that important sentence explain Who it was that did the dictating. It
was done by</p>
<p>“the divine power of Truth and Love, infinitely above me.“</p>
<p>Certainly that is definite. At last, through her personal testimony,
we have a sure grip upon the following vital facts, and they settle the
authorship of Science and Health beyond peradventure:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mrs. Eddy furnished “the ideas and the language.“ 2. God furnished
the ideas and the language.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a great comfort to have the matter authoritatively settled.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>It is hard to locate her, she shifts about so much. She is a shining
drop of quicksilver which you put your finger on and it isn’t there.
There is a paragraph in the Autobiography (page 96) which places in
seemingly darkly significant procession three Personages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Virgin Mary 2. Jesus of Nazareth. 3. Mrs. Eddy.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the paragraph referred to:</p>
<p>“No person can take the individual place of the Virgin Mary. No
person can compass or fulfil the individual mission of Jesus of
Nazareth. No person can take the place of the author of Science and
Health, the discoverer and founder of Christian Science. Each individual
must fill his own niche in time and eternity.“</p>
<p>I have read it many times, but I still cannot be sure that I rightly
understand it. If the Saviour’s name had been placed first and the
Virgin Mary’s second and Mrs. Eddy’s third, I should draw the inference
that a descending scale from First Importance to Second Importance and
then to Small Importance was indicated; but to place the Virgin first,
the Saviour second, and Mrs. Eddy third, seems to turn the scale the
other way and make it an ascending scale of Importances, with Mrs. Eddy
ranking the other two and holding first place.</p>
<p>I think that that was perhaps the intention, but none but a seasoned
Christian Scientist can examine a literary animal of Mrs. Eddy’s
creation and tell which end of it the tail is on. She is easily the most
baffling and bewildering writer in the literary trade.</p>
<p>Eddy is a commonplace name, and would have an unimpressive aspect in
the list of the reformed Holy Family. She has thought of that. In the
book of By-laws written by her–“impelled by a power not one’s own“–there
is a paragraph which explains how and when her disciples came to confer
a title upon her; and this explanation is followed by a warning as to
what will happen to any female Scientist who shall desecrate it:</p>
<p>“The title of Mother. Therefore if a student of Christian Science
shall apply this title, either to herself or to others, except as the
term for kinship according to the flesh, it shall be regarded by the
Church as an indication of disrespect for their Pastor Emeritus, and
unfitness to be a member of the Mother-Church.“</p>
<p>She is the Pastor Emeritus.</p>
<p>While the quoted paragraph about the Procession seems to indicate
that Mrs. Eddy is expecting to occupy the First Place in it, that
expectation is not definitely avowed. In an earlier utterance of hers
she is clearer–clearer, and does not claim the first place all to
herself, but only the half of it. I quote from Mr. Peabody’s book
again:</p>
<p>“In the Christian Science Journal for April, 1889, when it was her
property, and published by her, it was claimed for her, and with her
sanction, that she was equal with Jesus, and elaborate effort was made
to establish the claim.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Eddy has distinctly authorized the claim in her behalf that she
herself was the chosen successor to and equal of Jesus.“</p>
<p>In her Miscellaneous Writings (using her once favorite “We“ for “I“)
she says that “While we entertain decided views . . . and shall express
them as duty demands, we shall claim no especial gift from our divine
origin,“ etc.</p>
<p>Our divine origin. It suggests Equal again. It is inferable, then,
that in the near by-and-by the new Church will officially rank the Holy
Family in the following order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Jesus of Nazareth.–1. Our Mother. 2. The Virgin Mary.</li>
</ol>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>I am not playing with Christian Science and its founder, I am
examining them; and I am doing it because of the interest I feel in the
inquiry. My results may seem inadequate to the reader, but they have for
me clarified a muddle and brought a sort of order out of a chaos, and so
I value them.</p>
<p>My readings of Mrs. Eddy’s uninspired miscellaneous literary efforts
have convinced me of several things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>That she did not write Science and Health. 2. That the Deity did (or
did not) write it. 3. That She thinks She wrote it. 4. That She believes
She wrote it under the Deity’s inspiration. 5. That She believes She is
a Member of the Holy Family. 6. That She believes She is the equal of
the Head of it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I think She is now entitled to the capital S–on her own
evidence.</p>
