<h4 id="chapter-lx.">CHAPTER LX.</h4>
<p>SATAN (impatiently) to NEW-COMER. The trouble with you Chicago people
is, that you think you are the best people down here; whereas you are
merely the most numerous. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>We wandered contentedly around here and there in India; to Lahore,
among other places, where the Lieutenant-Governor lent me an elephant.
This hospitality stands out in my experiences in a stately isolation. It
was a fine elephant, affable, gentlemanly, educated, and I was not
afraid of it. I even rode it with confidence through the crowded lanes
of the native city, where it scared all the horses out of their senses,
and where children were always just escaping its feet. It took the
middle of the road in a fine independent way, and left it to the world
to get out of the way or take the consequences. I am used to being
afraid of collisions when I ride or drive, but when one is on top of an
elephant that feeling is absent. I could have ridden in comfort through
a regiment of runaway teams. I could easily learn to prefer an elephant
to any other vehicle, partly because of that immunity from collisions,
and partly because of the fine view one has from up there, and partly
because of the dignity one feels in that high place, and partly because
one can look in at the windows and see what is going on privately among
the family. The Lahore horses were used to elephants, but they were
rapturously afraid of them just the same. It seemed curious. Perhaps the
better they know the elephant the more they respect him in that peculiar
way. In our own case–we are not afraid of dynamite till we get
acquainted with it.</p>
<p>We drifted as far as Rawal Pindi, away up on the Afghan frontier–I
think it was the Afghan frontier, but it may have been Hertzegovina–it
was around there somewhere–and down again to Delhi, to see the ancient
architectural wonders there and in Old Delhi and not describe them, and
also to see the scene of the illustrious assault, in the Mutiny days,
when the British carried Delhi by storm, one of the marvels of history
for impudent daring and immortal valor.</p>
<p>We had a refreshing rest, there in Delhi, in a great old mansion
which possessed historical interest. It was built by a rich Englishman
who had become orientalized–so much so that he had a zenana. But he was
a broadminded man, and remained so. To please his harem he built a
mosque; to please himself he built an English church. That kind of a man
will arrive, somewhere. In the Mutiny days the mansion was the British
general’s headquarters. It stands in a great garden–oriental fashion
–and about it are many noble trees. The trees harbor monkeys; and they
are monkeys of a watchful and enterprising sort, and not much troubled
with fear. They invade the house whenever they get a chance, and carry
off everything they don’t want. One morning the master of the house was
in his bath, and the window was open. Near it stood a pot of yellow
paint and a brush. Some monkeys appeared in the window; to scare them
away, the gentleman threw his sponge at them. They did not scare at all;
they jumped into the room and threw yellow paint all over him from the
brush, and drove him out; then they painted the walls and the floor and
the tank and the windows and the furniture yellow, and were in the
dressing-room painting that when help arrived and routed them.</p>
<p>Two of these creatures came into my room in the early morning,
through a window whose shutters I had left open, and when I woke one of
them was before the glass brushing his hair, and the other one had my
note-book, and was reading a page of humorous notes and crying. I did
not mind the one with the hair-brush, but the conduct of the other one
hurt me; it hurts me yet. I threw something at him, and that was wrong,
for my host had told me that the monkeys were best left alone. They
threw everything at me that they could lift, and then went into the
bathroom to get some more things, and I shut the door on them.</p>
<p>At Jeypore, in Rajputana, we made a considerable stay. We were not in
the native city, but several miles from it, in the small European
official suburb. There were but few Europeans–only fourteen but they
were all kind and hospitable, and it amounted to being at home. In
Jeypore we found again what we had found all about India–that while the
Indian servant is in his way a very real treasure, he will sometimes
bear watching, and the Englishman watches him. If he sends him on an
errand, he wants more than the man’s word for it that he did the errand.
When fruit and vegetables were sent to us, a “chit“ came with them–a
receipt for us to sign; otherwise the things might not arrive. If a
gentleman sent up his carriage, the chit stated “from“ such-and-such an
hour “to“ such-and-such an hour–which made it unhandy for the coachman
and his two or three subordinates to put us off with a part of the
allotted time and devote the rest of it to a lark of their own.</p>
<p>We were pleasantly situated in a small two-storied inn, in an empty
large compound which was surrounded by a mud wall as high as a man’s
head. The inn was kept by nine Hindoo brothers, its owners. They lived,
with their families, in a one-storied building within the compound, but
off to one side, and there was always a long pile of their little comely
brown children loosely stacked in its veranda, and a detachment of the
parents wedged among them, smoking the hookah or the howdah, or whatever
they call it. By the veranda stood a palm, and a monkey lived in it, and
led a lonesome life, and always looked sad and weary, and the crows
bothered him a good deal.</p>
<p>The inn cow poked about the compound and emphasized the secluded and
country air of the place, and there was a dog of no particular breed,
who was always present in the compound, and always asleep, always
stretched out baking in the sun and adding to the deep tranquility and
reposefulness of the place, when the crows were away on business.
White-draperied servants were coming and going all the time, but they
seemed only spirits, for their feet were bare and made no sound. Down
the lane a piece lived an elephant in the shade of a noble tree, and
rocked and rocked, and reached about with his trunk, begging of his
brown mistress or fumbling the children playing at his feet. And there
were camels about, but they go on velvet feet, and were proper to the
silence and serenity of the surroundings.</p>
<p>The Satan mentioned at the head of this chapter was not our Satan,
but the other one. Our Satan was lost to us. In these later days he had
passed out of our life–lamented by me, and sincerely. I was missing him;
I am missing him yet, after all these months. He was an astonishing
creature to fly around and do things. He didn’t always do them quite
right, but he did them, and did them suddenly. There was no time wasted.
You would say:</p>
<p>“Pack the trunks and bags, Satan.“</p>
<p>“Wair good“ (very good).</p>
<p>Then there would be a brief sound of thrashing and slashing and
humming and buzzing, and a spectacle as of a whirlwind spinning gowns
and jackets and coats and boots and things through the air, and then
with bow and touch–</p>
<p>“Awready, master.“</p>
<p>It was wonderful. It made one dizzy. He crumpled dresses a good deal,
and he had no particular plan about the work–at first–except to put each
article into the trunk it didn’t belong in. But he soon reformed, in
this matter. Not entirely; for, to the last, he would cram into the
satchel sacred to literature any odds and ends of rubbish that he
couldn’t find a handy place for elsewhere. When threatened with death
for this, it did not trouble him; he only looked pleasant, saluted with
soldierly grace, said “Wair good,“ and did it again next day.</p>
<p>He was always busy; kept the rooms tidied up, the boots polished, the
clothes brushed, the wash-basin full of clean water, my dress clothes
laid out and ready for the lecture-hall an hour ahead of time; and he
dressed me from head to heel in spite of my determination to do it
myself, according to my lifelong custom.</p>
<p>He was a born boss, and loved to command, and to jaw and dispute with
inferiors and harry them and bullyrag them. He was fine at the railway
station–yes, he was at his finest there. He would shoulder and plunge
and paw his violent way through the packed multitude of natives with
nineteen coolies at his tail, each bearing a trifle of luggage–one a
trunk, another a parasol, another a shawl, another a fan, and so on; one
article to each, and the longer the procession, the better he was suited
–and he was sure to make for some engaged sleeper and begin to hurl the
owner’s things out of it, swearing that it was ours and that there had
been a mistake. Arrived at our own sleeper, he would undo the
bedding-bundles and make the beds and put everything to rights and
shipshape in two minutes; then put his head out at, a window and have a
restful good time abusing his gang of coolies and disputing their bill
until we arrived and made him pay them and stop his noise.</p>
<p>Speaking of noise, he certainly was the noisest little devil in India
–and that is saying much, very much, indeed. I loved him for his noise,
but the family detested him for it. They could not abide it; they could
not get reconciled to it. It humiliated them. As a rule, when we got
within six hundred yards of one of those big railway stations, a mighty
racket of screaming and shrieking and shouting and storming would break
upon us, and I would be happy to myself, and the family would say, with
shame:</p>
<p>“There–that’s Satan. Why do you keep him?“</p>
<p>And, sure enough, there in the whirling midst of fifteen hundred
wondering people we would find that little scrap of a creature
gesticulating like a spider with the colic, his black eyes snapping, his
fez-tassel dancing, his jaws pouring out floods of billingsgate upon his
gang of beseeching and astonished coolies.</p>
<p>I loved him; I couldn’t help it; but the family–why, they could
hardly speak of him with patience. To this day I regret his loss, and
wish I had him back; but they–it is different with them. He was a
native, and came from Surat. Twenty degrees of latitude lay between his
birthplace and Manuel’s, and fifteen hundred between their ways and
characters and dispositions. I only liked Manuel, but I loved Satan.
This latter’s real name was intensely Indian. I could not quite get the
hang of it, but it sounded like Bunder Rao Ram Chunder Clam Chowder. It
was too long for handy use, anyway; so I reduced it.</p>
<p>When he had been with us two or three weeks, he began to make
mistakes which I had difficulty in patching up for him. Approaching
Benares one day, he got out of the train to see if he could get up a
misunderstanding with somebody, for it had been a weary, long journey
and he wanted to freshen up. He found what he was after, but kept up his
pow-wow a shade too long and got left. So there we were in a strange
city and no chambermaid. It was awkward for us, and we told him he must
not do so any more. He saluted and said in his dear, pleasant way, “Wair
good.“ Then at Lucknow he got drunk. I said it was a fever, and got the
family’s compassion, and solicitude aroused; so they gave him a
teaspoonful of liquid quinine and it set his vitals on fire. He made
several grimaces which gave me a better idea of the Lisbon earthquake
than any I have ever got of it from paintings and descriptions. His
drunk was still portentously solid next morning, but I could have pulled
him through with the family if he would only have taken another spoonful
of that remedy; but no, although he was stupefied, his memory still had
flickerings of life; so he smiled a divinely dull smile and said,
fumblingly saluting:</p>
<p>“Scoose me, mem Saheb, scoose me, Missy Saheb; Satan not prefer it,
please.“</p>
<p>Then some instinct revealed to them that he was drunk. They gave him
prompt notice that next time this happened he must go. He got out a
maudlin and most gentle “Wair good,“ and saluted indefinitely.</p>
<p>Only one short week later he fell again. And oh, sorrow! not in a
hotel this time, but in an English gentleman’s private house. And in
Agra, of all places. So he had to go. When I told him, he said
patiently, “Wair good,“ and made his parting salute, and went out from
us to return no more forever. Dear me! I would rather have lost a
hundred angels than that one poor lovely devil. What style he used to
put on, in a swell hotel or in a private house–snow-white muslin from
his chin to his bare feet, a crimson sash embroidered with gold thread
around his waist, and on his head a great sea-green turban like to the
turban of the Grand Turk.</p>
<p>He was not a liar; but he will become one if he keeps on. He told me
once that he used to crack cocoanuts with his teeth when he was a boy;
and when I asked how he got them into his mouth, he said he was upward
of six feet high at that time, and had an unusual mouth. And when I
followed him up and asked him what had become of that other foot, he
said a house fell on him and he was never able to get his stature back
again. Swervings like these from the strict line of fact often beguile a
truthful man on and on until he eventually becomes a liar.</p>
<p>His successor was a Mohammedan, Sahadat Mohammed Khan; very dark,
very tall, very grave. He went always in flowing masses of white, from
the top of his big turban down to his bare feet. His voice was low. He
glided about in a noiseless way, and looked like a ghost. He was
competent and satisfactory. But where he was, it seemed always Sunday.
It was not so in Satan’s time.</p>
<p>Jeypore is intensely Indian, but it has two or three features which
indicate the presence of European science and European interest in the
weal of the common public, such as the liberal water-supply furnished by
great works built at the State’s expense; good sanitation, resulting in
a degree of healthfulness unusually high for India; a noble pleasure
garden, with privileged days for women; schools for the instruction of
native youth in advanced art, both ornamental and utilitarian; and a new
and beautiful palace stocked with a museum of extraordinary interest and
value. Without the Maharaja’s sympathy and purse these beneficences
could not have been created; but he is a man of wide views and large
generosities, and all such matters find hospitality with him.</p>
<p>We drove often to the city from the hotel Kaiser-i-Hind, a journey
which was always full of interest, both night and day, for that country
road was never quiet, never empty, but was always India in motion,
always a streaming flood of brown people clothed in smouchings from the
rainbow, a tossing and moiling flood, happy, noisy, a charming and
satisfying confusion of strange human and strange animal life and
equally strange and outlandish vehicles.</p>
<p>And the city itself is a curiosity. Any Indian city is that, but this
one is not like any other that we saw. It is shut up in a lofty turreted
wall; the main body of it is divided into six parts by perfectly
straight streets that are more than a hundred feet wide; the blocks of
houses exhibit a long frontage of the most taking architectural
quaintnesses, the straight lines being broken everywhere by pretty
little balconies, pillared and highly ornamented, and other cunning and
cozy and inviting perches and projections, and many of the fronts are
curiously pictured by the brush, and the whole of them have the soft
rich tint of strawberry ice-cream. One cannot look down the far stretch
of the chief street and persuade himself that these are real houses, and
that it is all out of doors–the impression that it is an unreality, a
picture, a scene in a theater, is the only one that will take hold.</p>
<p>Then there came a great day when this illusion was more pronounced
than ever. A rich Hindoo had been spending a fortune upon the
manufacture of a crowd of idols and accompanying paraphernalia whose
purpose was to illustrate scenes in the life of his especial god or
saint, and this fine show was to be brought through the town in
processional state at ten in the morning. As we passed through the great
public pleasure garden on our way to the city we found it crowded with
natives. That was one sight. Then there was another. In the midst of the
spacious lawns stands the palace which contains the museum–a beautiful
construction of stone which shows arched colonnades, one above another,
and receding, terrace-fashion, toward the sky. Every one of these
terraces, all the way to the top one, was packed and jammed with
natives. One must try to imagine those solid masses of splendid color,
one above another, up and up, against the blue sky, and the Indian sun
turning them all to beds of fire and flame.</p>
<p>Later, when we reached the city, and glanced down the chief avenue,
smouldering in its crushed-strawberry tint, those splendid effects were
repeated; for every balcony, and every fanciful bird-cage of a snuggery
countersunk in the house-fronts, and all the long lines of roofs were
crowded with people, and each crowd was an explosion of brilliant
color.</p>
<p>Then the wide street itself, away down and down and down into the
distance, was alive with gorgeously-clothed people not still, but
moving, swaying, drifting, eddying, a delirious display of all colors
and all shades of color, delicate, lovely, pale, soft, strong, stunning,
vivid, brilliant, a sort of storm of sweetpea blossoms passing on the
wings of a hurricane; and presently, through this storm of color, came
swaying and swinging the majestic elephants, clothed in their Sunday
best of gaudinesses, and the long procession of fanciful trucks
freighted with their groups of curious and costly images, and then the
long rearguard of stately camels, with their picturesque riders.</p>
<p>For color, and picturesqueness, and novelty, and outlandishness, and
sustained interest and fascination, it was the most satisfying show I
had ever seen, and I suppose I shall not have the privilege of looking
upon its like again.</p>
