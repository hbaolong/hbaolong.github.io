<h4 id="chapter-xl.">CHAPTER XL.</h4>
<p>Few of us can stand prosperity. Another man’s, I mean. –Pudd’nhead
Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>The next picture in my mind is Government House, on Malabar Point,
with the wide sea-view from the windows and broad balconies; abode of
His Excellency the Governor of the Bombay Presidency–a residence which
is European in everything but the native guards and servants, and is a
home and a palace of state harmoniously combined.</p>
<p>That was England, the English power, the English civilization, the
modern civilization–with the quiet elegancies and quiet colors and quiet
tastes and quiet dignity that are the outcome of the modern cultivation.
And following it came a picture of the ancient civilization of India–an
hour in the mansion of a native prince: Kumar Schri Samatsinhji Bahadur
of the Palitana State.</p>
<p>The young lad, his heir, was with the prince; also, the lad’s sister,
a wee brown sprite, very pretty, very serious, very winning, delicately
moulded, costumed like the daintiest butterfly, a dear little fairyland
princess, gravely willing to be friendly with the strangers, but in the
beginning preferring to hold her father’s hand until she could take
stock of them and determine how far they were to be trusted. She must
have been eight years old; so in the natural (Indian) order of things
she would be a bride in three or four years from now, and then this free
contact with the sun and the air and the other belongings of out-door
nature and comradeship with visiting male folk would end, and she would
shut herself up in the zenana for life, like her mother, and by
inherited habit of mind would be happy in that seclusion and not look
upon it as an irksome restraint and a weary captivity.</p>
<p>The game which the prince amuses his leisure with–however, never mind
it, I should never be able to describe it intelligibly. I tried to get
an idea of it while my wife and daughter visited the princess in the
zenana, a lady of charming graces and a fluent speaker of English, but I
did not make it out. It is a complicated game, and I believe it is said
that nobody can learn to play it well–but an Indian. And I was not able
to learn how to wind a turban. It seemed a simple art and easy; but that
was a deception. It is a piece of thin, delicate stuff a foot wide or
more, and forty or fifty feet long; and the exhibitor of the art takes
one end of it in his hands, and winds it in and out intricately about
his head, twisting it as he goes, and in a minute or two the thing is
finished, and is neat and symmetrical and fits as snugly as a mould.</p>
<p>We were interested in the wardrobe and the jewels, and in the
silverware, and its grace of shape and beauty and delicacy of
ornamentation. The silverware is kept locked up, except at meal-times,
and none but the chief butler and the prince have keys to the safe. I
did not clearly understand why, but it was not for the protection of the
silver. It was either to protect the prince from the contamination which
his caste would suffer if the vessels were touched by low-caste hands,
or it was to protect his highness from poison. Possibly it was both. I
believe a salaried taster has to taste everything before the prince
ventures it–an ancient and judicious custom in the East, and has thinned
out the tasters a good deal, for of course it is the cook that puts the
poison in. If I were an Indian prince I would not go to the expense of a
taster, I would eat with the cook.</p>
<p>Ceremonials are always interesting; and I noted that the Indian
good-morning is a ceremonial, whereas ours doesn’t amount to that. In
salutation the son reverently touches the father’s forehead with a small
silver implement tipped with vermillion paste which leaves a red spot
there, and in return the son receives the father’s blessing. Our good
morning is well enough for the rowdy West, perhaps, but would be too
brusque for the soft and ceremonious East.</p>
<p>After being properly necklaced, according to custom, with great
garlands made of yellow flowers, and provided with betel-nut to chew,
this pleasant visit closed, and we passed thence to a scene of a
different sort: from this glow of color and this sunny life to those
grim receptacles of the Parsee dead, the Towers of Silence. There is
something stately about that name, and an impressiveness which sinks
deep; the hush of death is in it. We have the Grave, the Tomb, the
Mausoleum, God’s Acre, the Cemetery; and association has made them
eloquent with solemn meaning; but we have no name that is so majestic as
that one, or lingers upon the ear with such deep and haunting
pathos.</p>
<p>On lofty ground, in the midst of a paradise of tropical foliage and
flowers, remote from the world and its turmoil and noise, they stood–the
Towers of Silence; and away below was spread the wide groves of cocoa
palms, then the city, mile on mile, then the ocean with its fleets of
creeping ships all steeped in a stillness as deep as the hush that
hallowed this high place of the dead. The vultures were there. They
stood close together in a great circle all around the rim of a massive
low tower–waiting; stood as motionless as sculptured ornaments, and
indeed almost deceived one into the belief that that was what they were.
Presently there was a slight stir among the score of persons present,
and all moved reverently out of the path and ceased from talking. A
funeral procession entered the great gate, marching two and two, and
moved silently by, toward the Tower. The corpse lay in a shallow shell,
and was under cover of a white cloth, but was otherwise naked. The
bearers of the body were separated by an interval of thirty feet from
the mourners. They, and also the mourners, were draped all in pure
white, and each couple of mourners was figuratively bound together by a
piece of white rope or a handkerchief–though they merely held the ends
of it in their hands. Behind the procession followed a dog, which was
led in a leash. When the mourners had reached the neighborhood of the
Tower –neither they nor any other human being but the bearers of the
dead must approach within thirty feet of it–they turned and went back to
one of the prayer-houses within the gates, to pray for the spirit of
their dead. The bearers unlocked the Tower’s sole door and disappeared
from view within. In a little while they came out bringing the bier and
the white covering-cloth, and locked the door again. Then the ring of
vultures rose, flapping their wings, and swooped down into the Tower to
devour the body. Nothing was left of it but a clean-picked skeleton when
they flocked-out again a few minutes afterward.</p>
<p>The principle which underlies and orders everything connected with a
Parsee funeral is Purity. By the tenets of the Zoroastrian religion, the
elements, Earth, Fire, and Water, are sacred, and must not be
contaminated by contact with a dead body. Hence corpses must not be
burned, neither must they be buried. None may touch the dead or enter
the Towers where they repose except certain men who are officially
appointed for that purpose. They receive high pay, but theirs is a
dismal life, for they must live apart from their species, because their
commerce with the dead defiles them, and any who should associate with
them would share their defilement. When they come out of the Tower the
clothes they are wearing are exchanged for others, in a building within
the grounds, and the ones which they have taken off are left behind, for
they are contaminated, and must never be used again or suffered to go
outside the grounds. These bearers come to every funeral in new
garments. So far as is known, no human being, other than an official
corpse-bearer–save one–has ever entered a Tower of Silence after its
consecration. Just a hundred years ago a European rushed in behind the
bearers and fed his brutal curiosity with a glimpse of the forbidden
mysteries of the place. This shabby savage’s name is not given; his
quality is also concealed. These two details, taken in connection with
the fact that for his extraordinary offense the only punishment he got
from the East India Company’s Government was a solemn official
“reprimand“–suggest the suspicion that he was a European of consequence.
The same public document which contained the reprimand gave warning that
future offenders of his sort, if in the Company’s service, would be
dismissed; and if merchants, suffer revocation of license and exile to
England.</p>
<p>The Towers are not tall, but are low in proportion to their
circumference, like a gasometer. If you should fill a gasometer half way
up with solid granite masonry, then drive a wide and deep well down
through the center of this mass of masonry, you would have the idea of a
Tower of Silence. On the masonry surrounding the well the bodies lie, in
shallow trenches which radiate like wheel-spokes from the well. The
trenches slant toward the well and carry into it the rainfall.
Underground drains, with charcoal filters in them, carry off this water
from the bottom of the well.</p>
<p>When a skeleton has lain in the Tower exposed to the rain and the
flaming sun a month it is perfectly dry and clean. Then the same bearers
that brought it there come gloved and take it up with tongs and throw it
into the well. There it turns to dust. It is never seen again, never
touched again, in the world. Other peoples separate their dead, and
preserve and continue social distinctions in the grave–the skeletons of
kings and statesmen and generals in temples and pantheons proper to
skeletons of their degree, and the skeletons of the commonplace and the
poor in places suited to their meaner estate; but the Parsees hold that
all men rank alike in death–all are humble, all poor, all destitute. In
sign of their poverty they are sent to their grave naked, in sign of
their equality the bones of the rich, the poor, the illustrious and the
obscure are flung into the common well together. At a Parsee funeral
there are no vehicles; all concerned must walk, both rich and poor,
howsoever great the distance to be traversed may be. In the wells of the
Five Towers of Silence is mingled the dust of all the Parsee men and
women and children who have died in Bombay and its vicinity during the
two centuries which have elapsed since the Mohammedan conquerors drove
the Parsees out of Persia, and into that region of India. The earliest
of the five towers was built by the Modi family something more than 200
years ago, and it is now reserved to the heirs of that house; none but
the dead of that blood are carried thither.</p>
<p>The origin of at least one of the details of a Parsee funeral is not
now known–the presence of the dog. Before a corpse is borne from the
house of mourning it must be uncovered and exposed to the gaze of a dog;
a dog must also be led in the rear of the funeral. Mr. Nusserwanjee
Byranijee, Secretary to the Parsee Punchayet, said that these
formalities had once had a meaning and a reason for their institution,
but that they were survivals whose origin none could now account for.
Custom and tradition continue them in force, antiquity hallows them. It
is thought that in ancient times in Persia the dog was a sacred animal
and could guide souls to heaven; also that his eye had the power of
purifying objects which had been contaminated by the touch of the dead;
and that hence his presence with the funeral cortege provides an
ever-applicable remedy in case of need.</p>
<p>The Parsees claim that their method of disposing of the dead is an
effective protection of the living; that it disseminates no corruption,
no impurities of any sort, no disease-germs; that no wrap, no garment
which has touched the dead is allowed to touch the living afterward;
that from the Towers of Silence nothing proceeds which can carry harm to
the outside world. These are just claims, I think. As a sanitary
measure, their system seems to be about the equivalent of cremation, and
as sure. We are drifting slowly–but hopefully–toward cremation in these
days. It could not be expected that this progress should be swift, but
if it be steady and continuous, even if slow, that will suffice. When
cremation becomes the rule we shall cease to shudder at it; we should
shudder at burial if we allowed ourselves to think what goes on in the
grave.</p>
<p>The dog was an impressive figure to me, representing as he did a
mystery whose key is lost. He was humble, and apparently depressed; and
he let his head droop pensively, and looked as if he might be trying to
call back to his mind what it was that he had used to symbolize ages ago
when he began his function. There was another impressive thing close at
hand, but I was not privileged to see it. That was the sacred fire–a
fire which is supposed to have been burning without interruption for
more than two centuries; and so, living by the same heat that was
imparted to it so long ago.</p>
<p>The Parsees are a remarkable community. There are only about 60,000
in Bombay, and only about half as many as that in the rest of India; but
they make up in importance what they lack in numbers. They are highly
educated, energetic, enterprising, progressive, rich, and the Jew
himself is not more lavish or catholic in his charities and
benevolences. The Parsees build and endow hospitals, for both men and
animals; and they and their womenkind keep an open purse for all great
and good objects. They are a political force, and a valued support to
the government. They have a pure and lofty religion, and they preserve
it in its integrity and order their lives by it.</p>
<p>We took a final sweep of the wonderful view of plain and city and
ocean, and so ended our visit to the garden and the Towers of Silence;
and the last thing I noticed was another symbol–a voluntary symbol this
one; it was a vulture standing on the sawed-off top of a tall and
slender and branchless palm in an open space in the ground; he was
perfectly motionless, and looked like a piece of sculpture on a pillar.
And he had a mortuary look, too, which was in keeping with the
place.</p>
