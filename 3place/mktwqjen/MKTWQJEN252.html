<h4 id="our-precious-lunatic">OUR PRECIOUS LUNATIC</h4>
<p>[From the Buffalo Express, Saturday, May 14, 1870.]</p>
<p>New YORK, May 10.</p>
<p>The Richardson-McFarland jury had been out one hour and fifty
minutes. A breathless silence brooded over court and auditory–a silence
and a stillness so absolute, notwithstanding the vast multitude of human
beings packed together there, that when some one far away among the
throng under the northeast balcony cleared his throat with a smothered
little cough it startled everybody uncomfortably, so distinctly did it
grate upon the pulseless air. At that imposing moment the bang of a door
was heard, then the shuffle of approaching feet, and then a sort of
surging and swaying disorder among the heads at the entrance from the
jury-room told them that the Twelve were coming. Presently all was
silent again, and the foreman of the jury rose and said:</p>
<p>“Your Honor and Gentleman: We, the jury charged with the duty of
determining whether the prisoner at the bar, Daniel McFarland, has been
guilty of murder, in taking by surprise an unarmed man and shooting him
to death, or whether the prisoner is afflicted with a sad but
irresponsible insanity which at times can be cheered only by violent
entertainment with firearms, do find as follows, namely:</p>
<p>“That the prisoner, Daniel McFarland, is insane as above described.
Because:</p>
<p>“1. His great grandfather’s stepfather was tainted with insanity, and
frequently killed people who were distasteful to him. Hence, insanity is
hereditary in the family.</p>
<p>“2. For nine years the prisoner at the bar did not adequately support
his family. Strong circumstantial evidence of insanity.</p>
<p>“3. For nine years he made of his home, as a general thing, a
poor-house; sometimes (but very rarely) a cheery, happy habitation;
frequently the den of a beery, drivelling, stupefied animal; but never,
as far as ascertained, the abiding place of a gentleman. These be
evidences of insanity.</p>
<p>“4. He once took his young unmarried sister-in-law to the museum;
while there his hereditary insanity came upon him to such a degree that
he hiccupped and staggered; and afterward, on the way home, even made
love to the young girl he was protecting. These are the acts of a person
not in his right mind.</p>
<p>“5. For a good while his sufferings were so great that he had to
submit to the inconvenience of having his wife give public readings for
the family support; and at times, when he handed these shameful earnings
to the barkeeper, his haughty soul was so torn with anguish that he
could hardly stand without leaning against something. At such times he
has been known to shed tears into his sustenance till it diluted to
utter inefficiency. Inattention of this nature is not the act of a
Democrat unafflicted in mind.</p>
<p>“6. He never spared expense in making his wife comfortable during her
occasional confinements. Her father is able to testify to this. There
was always an element of unsoundness about the prisoner’s generosities
that is very suggestive at this time and before this court.</p>
<p>“7. Two years ago the prisoner came fearlessly up behind Richardson
in the dark, and shot him in the leg. The prisoner’s brave and
protracted defiance of an adversity that for years had left him little
to depend upon for support but a wife who sometimes earned scarcely
anything for weeks at a time, is evidence that he would have appeared in
front of Richardson and shot him in the stomach if he had not been
insane at the time of the shooting.</p>
<p>“8. Fourteen months ago the prisoner told Archibald Smith that he was
going to kill Richardson. This is insanity.</p>
<p>“9. Twelve months ago he told Marshall P. Jones that he was going to
kill Richardson. Insanity.</p>
<p>“10. Nine months ago he was lurking about Richardson’s home in New
Jersey, and said he was going to kill Richardson. Insanity.</p>
<p>“11. Seven months ago he showed a pistol to Seth Brown and said that
that was for Richardson. He said Brown testified that at that time it
seemed plain that something was the matter with McFarland, for he
crossed the street diagonally nine times in fifty yards, apparently
without any settled reason for doing so, and finally fell in the gutter
and went to sleep. He remarked at the time that McFarland acted
strange–believed he was insane. Upon hearing Brown’s evidence, John W.
Galen, M.D., affirmed at once that McFarland was insane.</p>
<p>“12. Five months ago, McFarland showed his customary pistol, in his
customary way, to his bed-fellow, Charles A. Dana, and told him he was
going to kill Richardson the first time an opportunity offered. Evidence
of insanity.</p>
<p>“13. Five months and two weeks ago McFarland asked John Morgan the
time of day, and turned and walked rapidly away without waiting for an
answer. Almost indubitable evidence of insanity. And–</p>
<p>“14. It is remarkable that exactly one week after this circumstance,
the prisoner, Daniel McFarland, confronted Albert D. Richardson suddenly
and without warning, and shot him dead. This is manifest insanity.
Everything we know of the prisoner goes to show that if he had been sane
at the time, he would have shot his victim from behind.</p>
<p>“15. There is an absolutely overwhelming mass of testimony to show
that an hour before the shooting, McFarland was ANXIOUS AND UNEASY, and
that five minutes after it he was EXCITED. Thus the accumulating
conjectures and evidences of insanity culminate in this sublime and
unimpeachable proof of it. Therefore–</p>
<p>“Your Honor and Gentlemen–We the jury pronounce the said Daniel
McFarland INNOCENT OF MURDER, BUT CALAMITOUSLY INSANE.“</p>
<p>The scene that ensued almost defies description. Hats, handkerchiefs
and bonnets were frantically waved above the massed heads in the
courtroom, and three tremendous cheers and a tiger told where the
sympathies of the court and people were. Then a hundred pursed lips were
advanced to kiss the liberated prisoner, and many a hand thrust out to
give him a congratulatory shake–but presto! with a maniac’s own
quickness and a maniac’s own fury the lunatic assassin of Richardson
fell upon his friends with teeth and nails, boots and office furniture,
and the amazing rapidity with which he broke heads and limbs, and rent
and sundered bodies, till nearly a hundred citizens were reduced to mere
quivering heaps of fleshy odds and ends and crimson rags, was like
nothing in this world but the exultant frenzy of a plunging, tearing,
roaring devil of a steam machine when it snatches a human being and
spins him and whirls him till he shreds away to nothingness like a “Four
o’clock“ before the breath of a child.</p>
<p>The destruction was awful. It is said that within the space of eight
minutes McFarland killed and crippled some six score persons and tore
down a large portion of the City Hall building, carrying away and
casting into Broadway six or seven marble columns fifty-four feet long
and weighing nearly two tons each. But he was finally captured and sent
in chains to the lunatic asylum for life.</p>
<p>(By late telegrams it appears that this is a mistake.–Editor
Express.)</p>
<p>But the really curious part of this whole matter is yet to be told.
And that is, that McFarland’s most intimate friends believe that the
very next time that it ever occurred to him that the insanity plea was
not a mere politic pretense, was when the verdict came in. They think
that the startling thought burst upon him then, that if twelve good and
true men, able to comprehend all the baseness of perjury, proclaimed
under oath that he was a lunatic, there was no gainsaying such evidence
and that he UNQUESTIONABLY WAS INSANE!</p>
<p>Possibly that was really the way of it. It is dreadful to think that
maybe the most awful calamity that can befall a man, namely, loss of
reason, was precipitated upon this poor prisoner’s head by a jury that
could have hanged him instead, and so done him a mercy and his country a
service.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPT-LATER</p>
<p>May 11–I do not expect anybody to believe so astounding a thing, and
yet it is the solemn truth that instead of instantly sending the
dangerous lunatic to the insane asylum (which I naturally supposed they
would do, and so I prematurely said they had) the court has actually SET
HIM AT LIBERTY. Comment is unnecessary. M. T.</p>
<p>THE EUROPEAN WARS–[From the Buffalo Express, July 25, 1870.]</p>
<p>First Day THE EUROPEAN WAR!!!</p>
<p>NO BATTLE YET!!! HOSTILITIES IMMINENT!!! TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT.
AUSTRIA ARMING! BERLIN, Tuesday.</p>
<p>No battle has been fought yet. But hostilities may burst forth any
week.</p>
<p>There is tremendous excitement here over news from the front that two
companies of French soldiers are assembling there.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that Austria is arming–what with, is not known.</p>
<p>…………………..</p>
<p>Second Day THE EUROPEAN WAR</p>
<p>NO BATTLE YET! FIGHTING IMMINENT. AWFUL EXCITEMENT. RUSSIA SIDES WITH
PRUSSIA! ENGLAND NEUTRAL!! AUSTRIA NOT ARMING. BERLIN, Wednesday.</p>
<p>No battle has been fought yet. However, all thoughtful men feel that
the land may be drenched with blood before the Summer is over.</p>
<p>There is an awful excitement here over the rumour that two companies
of Prussian troops have concentrated on the border. German confidence
remains unshaken!!</p>
<p>There is news to the effect that Russia espouses the cause of Prussia
and will bring 4,000,000 men to the field.</p>
<p>England proclaims strict neutrality.</p>
<p>The report that Austria is arming needs confirmation.</p>
<p>…………………….</p>
<p>Third Day THE EUROPEAN WAR</p>
<p>NO BATTLE YET! BLOODSHED IMMINENT!! ENORMOUS EXCITEMENT!! INVASION OF
PRUSSIA!! INVASION OF FRANCE!! RUSSIA SIDES WITH FRANCE. ENGLAND STILL
NEUTRAL! FIRING HEARD! THE EMPEROR TO TAKE COMMAND. PARIS, Thursday.</p>
<p>No battle has been fought yet. But Field Marshal McMahon telegraphs
thus to the Emperor:</p>
<p>“If the Frinch army survoives until Christmas there’ll be throuble.
Forninst this fact it would be sagacious if the divil wint the rounds of
his establishment to prepare for the occasion, and tuk the precaution to
warrum up the Prussian depairtment a bit agin the day. MIKE.“</p>
<p>There is an enormous state of excitement here over news from the
front to the effect that yesterday France and Prussia were
simultaneously invaded by the two bodies of troops which lately
assembled on the border. Both armies conducted their invasions secretly
and are now hunting around for each other on opposite sides of the
border.</p>
<p>Russia espouses the cause of France. She will bring 200,000 men to
the field.</p>
<p>England continues to remain neutral.</p>
<p>Firing was heard yesterday in the direction of Blucherberg, and for a
while the excitement was intense. However the people reflected that the
country in that direction is uninhabitable, and impassable by anything
but birds, they became quiet again.</p>
<p>The Emperor sends his troops to the field with immense enthusiasm. He
will lead them in person, when they return.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>Fourth Day THE EUROPEAN WAR!</p>
<p>NO BATTLE YET!! THE TROOPS GROWING OLD! BUT BITTER STRIFE IMMINENT!
PRODIGIOUS EXCITEMENT! THE INVASIONS SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED AND THE
INVADERS SAFE! RUSSIA SIDES WITH BOTH SIDES ENGLAND WILL FIGHT BOTH!
LONDON, Friday.</p>
<p>No battle has been fought thus far, but a million impetuous soldiers
are gritting their teeth at each other across the border, and the most
serious fears entertained that if they do not die of old age first,
there will be bloodshed in this war yet.</p>
<p>The prodigious patriotic excitement goes on. In Prussia, per Prussian
telegrams, though contradicted from France. In France, per French
telegrams, though contradicted from Prussia.</p>
<p>The Prussian invasion of France was a magnificent success. The
military failed to find the French, but made good their return to
Prussia without the loss of a single man. The French invasion of Prussia
is also demonstrated to have been a brilliant and successful
achievement. The army failed to find the Prussians, but made good their
return to the Vaterland without bloodshed, after having invaded as much
as they wanted to.</p>
<p>There is glorious news from Russia to the effect that she will side
with both sides.</p>
<p>Also from England–she will fight both sides.</p>
<p>………………..</p>
<p>LONDON, Thursday evening.</p>
<p>I rushed over too soon. I shall return home on Tuesday’s steamer and
wait until the war begins. M. T.</p>
<p>THE WILD MAN INTERVIEWED [From the Buffalo Express, September 18,
1869.]</p>
<p>There has been so much talk about the mysterious “wild man“ out there
in the West for some time, that I finally felt it was my duty to go out
and interview him. There was something peculiarly and touchingly
romantic about the creature and his strange actions, according to the
newspaper reports. He was represented as being hairy, long-armed, and of
great strength and stature; ugly and cumbrous; avoiding men, but
appearing suddenly and unexpectedly to women and children; going armed
with a club, but never molesting any creature, except sheep, or other
prey; fond of eating and drinking, and not particular about the quality,
quantity, or character of the beverages and edibles; living in the woods
like a wild beast, but never angry; moaning, and sometimes howling, but
never uttering articulate sounds.</p>
<p>Such was “Old Shep“ as the papers painted him. I felt that the story
of his life must be a sad one–a story of suffering, disappointment, and
exile–a story of man’s inhumanity to man in some shape or other–and I
longed to persuade the secret from him.</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>“Since you say you are a member of the press,“ said the wild man, “I
am willing to tell you all you wish to know. Bye and bye you will
comprehend why it is that I wish to unbosom myself to a newspaper man
when I have so studiously avoided conversation with other people. I will
now unfold my strange story. I was born with the world we live upon,
almost. I am the son of Cain.“</p>
<p>“What?“</p>
<p>“I was present when the flood was announced.“</p>
<p>“Which?“</p>
<p>“I am the father of the Wandering Jew.“</p>
<p>“Sir?“</p>
<p>I moved out of range of his club, and went on taking notes, but
keeping a wary eye on him all the while. He smiled a melancholy smile
and resumed:</p>
<p>“When I glance back over the dreary waste of ages, I see many a
glimmering and mark that is familiar to my memory. And oh, the leagues I
have travelled! the things I have seen! the events I have helped to
emphasise! I was at the assassination of Caesar. I marched upon Mecca
with Mahomet. I was in the Crusades, and stood with Godfrey when he
planted the banner of the cross on the battlements of Jerusalem. I–“</p>
<p>“One moment, please. Have you given these items to any other journal?
Can I–“</p>
<p>“Silence. I was in the Pinta’s shrouds with Columbus when America
burst upon his vision. I saw Charles I beheaded. I was in London when
the Gunpowder Plot was discovered. I was present at the trial of Warren
Hastings. I was on American soil when the battle of Lexington was fought
when the declaration was promulgated–when Cornwallis surrendered –When
Washington died. I entered Paris with Napoleon after Elba. I was present
when you mounted your guns and manned your fleets for the war of
1812–when the South fired upon Sumter–when Richmond fell–when the
President’s life was taken. In all the ages I have helped to celebrate
the triumphs of genius, the achievements of arms, the havoc of storm,
fire, pestilence, famine.“</p>
<p>“Your career has been a stirring one. Might I ask how you came to
locate in these dull Kansas woods, when you have been so accustomed to
excitement during what I might term so protracted a period, not to put
too fine a point on it?“</p>
<p>“Listen. Once I was the honoured servitor of the noble and
illustrious“ (here he heaved a sigh, and passed his hairy hand across
his eyes) “but in these degenerate days I am become the slave of quack
doctors and newspapers. I am driven from pillar to post and hurried up
and down, sometimes with stencil-plate and paste-brush to defile the
fences with cabalistic legends, and sometimes in grotesque and
extravagant character at the behest of some driving journal. I attended
to that Ocean Bank robbery some weeks ago, when I was hardly rested from
finishing up the pow-wow about the completion of the Pacific Railroad;
immediately I was spirited off to do an atrocious, murder for the
benefit of the New York papers; next to attend the wedding of a
patriarchal millionaire; next to raise a hurrah about the great boat
race; and then, just when I had begun to hope that my old bones would
have a rest, I am bundled off to this howling wilderness to strip, and
jibber, and be ugly and hairy, and pull down fences and waylay sheep,
and waltz around with a club, and play ‘Wild Man’ generally–and all to
gratify the whim of a bedlam of crazy newspaper scribblers? From one end
of the continent to the other, I am described as a gorilla, with a sort
of human seeming about me–and all to gratify this quill-driving scum of
the earth!“</p>
<p>“Poor old carpet bagger!“</p>
<p>“I have been served infamously, often, in modern and semi-modern
times. I have been compelled by base men to create fraudulent history,
and to perpetrate all sorts of humbugs. I wrote those crazy Junius
letters, I moped in a French dungeon for fifteen years, and wore a
ridiculous Iron Mask; I poked around your Northern forests, among your
vagabond Indians, a solemn French idiot, personating the ghost of a dead
Dauphin, that the gaping world might wonder if we had ‘a Bourbon among
us’; I have played sea-serpent off Nahant, and Woolly-Horse and
What-is-it for the museums; I have interviewed politicians for the Sun,
worked up all manner of miracles for the Herald, ciphered up election
returns for the World, and thundered Political Economy through the
Tribune. I have done all the extravagant things that the wildest
invention could contrive, and done them well, and this is my
reward–playing Wild Man in Kansas without a shirt!“</p>
<p>“Mysterious being, a light dawns vaguely upon me–it grows apace–what
–what is your name.“</p>
<p>“SENSATION!“</p>
<p>“Hence, horrible shape!“</p>
<p>It spoke again:</p>
<p>“Oh pitiless fate, my destiny hounds me once more. I am called. I go.
Alas, is there no rest for me?“</p>
<p>In a moment the Wild Man’s features seemed to soften and refine, and
his form to assume a more human grace and symmetry. His club changed to
a spade, and he shouldered it and started away sighing profoundly and
shedding tears.</p>
<p>“Whither, poor shade?“</p>
<p>“TO DIG UP THE BYRON FAMILY!“</p>
<p>Such was the response that floated back upon the wind as the sad
spirit shook its ringlets to the breeze, flourished its shovel aloft,
and disappeared beyond the brow of the hill.</p>
<p>All of which is in strict accordance with the facts.</p>
<p>M. T.</p>
<p>LAST WORDS OF GREAT MEN–[From the Buffalo Express, September 11,
1889.]</p>
<p>Marshal Neil’s last words were: “L’armee fran-caise!“ (The French
army.)–Exchange.</p>
<p>What a sad thing it is to see a man close a grand career with a
plagiarism in his mouth. Napoleon’s last words were: “Tete d’armee.“
(Head of the army.) Neither of those remarks amounts to anything as
“last words,“ and reflect little credit upon the utterers.</p>
<p>A distinguished man should be as particular about his last words as
he is about his last breath. He should write them out on a slip of paper
and take the judgment of his friends on them. He should never leave such
a thing to the last hour of his life, and trust to an intellectual
spirit at the last moment to enable him to say something smart with his
latest gasp and launch into eternity with grandeur. No–a man is apt to
be too much fagged and exhausted, both in body and mind, at such a time,
to be reliable; and maybe the very thing he wants to say, he cannot
think of to save him; and besides there are his weeping friends
bothering around; and worse than all as likely as not he may have to
deliver his last gasp before he is expecting to. A man cannot always
expect to think of a natty thing to say under such circumstances, and so
it is pure egotistic ostentation to put it off. There is hardly a case
on record where a man came to his last moment unprepared and said a good
thing hardly a case where a man trusted to that last moment and did not
make a solemn botch of it and go out of the world feeling absurd.</p>
<p>Now there was Daniel Webster. Nobody could tell him anything. He was
not afraid. He could do something neat when the time came. And how did
it turn out? Why, his will had to be fixed over; and then all the
relations came; and first one thing and then another interfered, till at
last he only had a chance to say, “I still live,“ and up he went.</p>
<p>Of course he didn’t still live, because he died–and so he might as
well have kept his last words to himself as to have gone and made such a
failure of it as that. A week before that fifteen minutes of calm
reflection would have enabled that man to contrive some last words that
would have been a credit to himself and a comfort to his family for
generations to come.</p>
<p>And there was John Quincy Adams. Relying on his splendid abilities
and his coolness in emergencies, he trusted to a happy hit at the last
moment to carry him through, and what was the result? Death smote him in
the House of Representatives, and he observed, casually, “This is the
last of earth.“ The last of earth! Why “the last of earth“ when there
was so much more left? If he had said it was the last rose of summer or
the last run of shad, it would have had as much point in it. What he
meant to say was, “Adam was the first and Adams is the last of earth,“
but he put it off a trifle too long, and so he had to go with that
unmeaning observation on his lips.</p>
<p>And there we have Napoleon’s “Tete d’armee.“ That don’t mean
anything. Taken by itself, “Head of the army,“ is no more important than
“Head of the police.“ And yet that was a man who could have said a good
thing if he had barred out the doctor and studied over it a while.
Marshal Neil, with half a century at his disposal, could not dash off
anything better in his last moments than a poor plagiarism of another
man’s words, which were not worth plagiarizing in the first place. “The
French army.“ Perfectly irrelevant–perfectly flat utterly pointless. But
if he had closed one eye significantly, and said, “The subscriber has
made it lively for the French army,“ and then thrown a little of the
comic into his last gasp, it would have been a thing to remember with
satisfaction all the rest of his life. I do wish our great men would
quit saying these flat things just at the moment they die. Let us have
their next-to-the-last words for a while, and see if we cannot patch up
from them something that will be more satisfactory.</p>
<p>The public does not wish to be outraged in this way all the time.</p>
<p>But when we come to call to mind the last words of parties who took
the trouble to make the proper preparation for the occasion, we
immediately notice a happy difference in the result.</p>
<p>There was Chesterfield. Lord Chesterfield had laboured all his life
to build up the most shining reputation for affability and elegance of
speech and manners the world has ever seen. And could you suppose he
failed to appreciate the efficiency of characteristic “last words,“ in
the matter of seizing the successfully driven nail of such a reputation
and clinching on the other side for ever? Not he. He prepared himself.
He kept his eye on the clock and his finger on his pulse. He awaited his
chance. And at last, when he knew his time was come, he pretended to
think a new visitor had entered, and so, with the rattle in his throat
emphasised for dramatic effect, he said to the servant, “Shin around,
John, and get the gentleman a chair.“ And so he died, amid thunders of
applause.</p>
<p>Next we have Benjamin Franklin. Franklin, the author of Poor
Richard’s quaint sayings; Franklin the immortal axiom-builder, who used
to sit up at nights reducing the rankest old threadbare platitudes to
crisp and snappy maxims that had a nice, varnished, original look in
their regimentals; who said, “Virtue is its own reward;“ who said,
“Procrastination is the thief of time;“ who said, “Time and tide wait
for no man“ and “Necessity is the mother of invention;“ good old
Franklin, the Josh Billings of the eighteenth century–though, sooth to
say, the latter transcends him in proverbial originality as much as he
falls short of him in correctness of orthography. What sort of tactics
did Franklin pursue? He pondered over his last words for as much as two
weeks, and then when the time came, he said, “None but the brave deserve
the fair,“ and died happy. He could not have said a sweeter thing if he
had lived till he was an idiot.</p>
<p>Byron made a poor business of it, and could not think of anything to
say, at the last moment but, “Augusta–sister–Lady Byron–tell Harriet
Beecher Stowe“–etc., etc.,–but Shakespeare was ready and said, “England
expects every man to do his duty!“ and went off with splendid eclat.</p>
<p>And there are other instances of sagacious preparation for a
felicitous closing remark. For instance:</p>
<p>Joan of Arc said, “Tramp, tramp, tramp the boys are marching.“</p>
<p>Alexander the Great said, “Another of those Santa Cruz punches, if
you please.“</p>
<p>The Empress Josephine said, “Not for Jo-“ and could get no
further.</p>
<p>Cleopatra said, “The Old Guard dies, but never surrenders.“</p>
<p>Sir Walter Raleigh said, “Executioner, can I take your whetstone a
moment, please?“ though what for is not clear.</p>
<p>John Smith said, “Alas, I am the last of my race.“</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth said, “Oh, I would give my kingdom for one moment
more –I have forgotten my last words.“</p>
<p>And Red Jacket, the noblest Indian brave that ever wielded a tomahawk
in defence of a friendless and persecuted race, expired with these
touching words upon his lips,
“Wawkawampanoosucwinnebayowallazvsagamoresa- skatchewan.“ There was not
a dry eye in the wigwam.</p>
<p>Let not this lesson be lost upon our public men. Let them take a
healthy moment for preparation, and contrive some last words that shall
be neat and to the point. Let Louis Napoleon say,</p>
<p>“I am content to follow my uncle–still, I do not wish to improve upon
his last word. Put me down for ‘Tete d’armee.’“</p>
<p>And Garret Davis, “Let me recite the unabridged dictionary.“</p>
<p>And H. G., “I desire, now, to say a few words on political
economy.“</p>
<p>And Mr. Bergh, “Only take part of me at a time, if the load will be
fatiguing to the hearse horses.“</p>
<p>And Andrew Johnson, “I have been an alderman, Member of Congress,
Governor, Senator, Pres–adieu, you know the rest.“</p>
<p>And Seward., “Alas!-ka.“</p>
<p>And Grant, “O.“</p>
<p>All of which is respectfully submitted, with the most honorable
intentions. M. T.</p>
<p>P. S.–I am obliged to leave out the illustrations. The artist finds
it impossible to make a picture of people’s last words.</p>

<p>1601</p>
<p>by Mark Twain</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN’S [Date, 1601]</p>
<p>Conversation As it was by the Social Fireside in the Time of the
Tudors</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>“Born irreverent,“ scrawled Mark Twain on a scratch pad, “–like all
other people I have ever known or heard of–I am hoping to remain so
while there are any reverent irreverences left to make fun of.“
–[Holograph manuscript of Samuel L. Clemens, in the collection of the F.
J. Meine]</p>
<p>Mark Twain was just as irreverent as he dared be, and 1601 reveals
his richest expression of sovereign contempt for overstuffed language,
genteel literature, and conventional idiocies. Later, when a magazine
editor apostrophized, “O that we had a Rabelais!“ Mark impishly and
anonymously–submitted 1601; and that same editor, a praiser of Rabelais,
scathingly abused it and the sender. In this episode, as in many others,
Mark Twain, the “bad boy“ of American literature, revealed his huge
delight in blasting the shams of contemporary hypocrisy. Too, there was
always the spirit of Tom Sawyer deviltry in Mark’s make-up that prompted
him, as he himself boasted, to see how much holy indignation he could
stir up in the world.</p>
<p>WHO WROTE 1601?</p>
<p>The correct and complete title of 1601, as first issued, was: [Date,
1601.] ‘Conversation, as it was by the Social Fireside, in the Time of
the Tudors.’ For many years after its anonymous first issue in 1880, its
authorship was variously conjectured and widely disputed. In Boston,
William T. Ball, one of the leading theatrical critics during the late
90’s, asserted that it was originally written by an English actor (name
not divulged) who gave it to him. Ball’s original, it was said, looked
like a newspaper strip in the way it was printed, and may indeed have
been a proof pulled in some newspaper office. In St. Louis, William
Marion Reedy, editor of the St. Louis Mirror, had seen this famous tour
de force circulated in the early 80’s in galley-proof form; he first
learned from Eugene Field that it was from the pen of Mark Twain.</p>
<p>“Many people,“ said Reedy, “thought the thing was done by Field and
attributed, as a joke, to Mark Twain. Field had a perfect genius for
that sort of thing, as many extant specimens attest, and for that sort
of practical joke; but to my thinking the humor of the piece is too
mellow –not hard and bright and bitter–to be Eugene Field’s.“ Reedy’s
opinion hits off the fundamental difference between these two great
humorists; one half suspects that Reedy was thinking of Field’s French
Crisis.</p>
<p>But Twain first claimed his bantling from the fog of anonymity in
1906, in a letter addressed to Mr. Charles Orr, librarian of Case
Library, Cleveland. Said Clemens, in the course of his letter, dated
July 30, 1906, from Dublin, New Hampshire:</p>
<p>“The title of the piece is 1601. The piece is a supposititious
conversation which takes place in Queen Elizabeth’s closet in that year,
between the Queen, Ben Jonson, Beaumont, Sir Walter Raleigh, the Duchess
of Bilgewater, and one or two others, and is not, as John Hay mistakenly
supposes, a serious effort to bring back our literature and philosophy
to the sober and chaste Elizabeth’s time; if there is a decent word
findable in it, it is because I overlooked it. I hasten to assure you
that it is not printed in my published writings.“</p>
<p>TWITTING THE REV. JOSEPH TWICHELL</p>
<p>The circumstances of how 1601 came to be written have since been
officially revealed by Albert Bigelow Paine in ‘Mark Twain, A
Bibliography’ (1912), and in the publication of Mark Twain’s Notebook
(1935).</p>
<p>1601 was written during the summer of 1876 when the Clemens family
had retreated to Quarry Farm in Elmira County, New York. Here
Mrs. Clemens enjoyed relief from social obligations, the children romped
over the countryside, and Mark retired to his octagonal study, which,
perched high on the hill, looked out upon the valley below. It was in
the famous summer of 1876, too, that Mark was putting the finishing
touches to Tom Sawyer. Before the close of the same year he had already
begun work on ‘The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn’, published in 1885.
It is interesting to note the use of the title, the “Duke of
Bilgewater,“ in Huck Finn when the “Duchess of Bilgewater“ had already
made her appearance in 1601. Sandwiched between his two great
masterpieces, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, the writing of 1601 was indeed a
strange interlude.</p>
<p>During this prolific period Mark wrote many minor items, most of them
rejected by Howells, and read extensively in one of his favorite books,
Pepys’ Diary. Like many another writer Mark was captivated by Pepys’
style and spirit, and “he determined,“ says Albert Bigelow Paine in his
‘Mark Twain, A Biography’, “to try his hand on an imaginary record of
conversation and court manners of a bygone day, written in the phrase of
the period. The result was ‘Fireside Conversation in the Time of Queen
Elizabeth’, or as he later called it, ‘1601’. The ‘conversation’
recorded by a supposed Pepys of that period, was written with all the
outspoken coarseness and nakedness of that rank day, when fireside
sociabilities were limited only to the loosened fancy, vocabulary, and
physical performance, and not by any bounds of convention.“</p>
<p>“It was written as a letter,“ continues Paine, “to that robust
divine, Rev. Joseph Twichell, who, unlike Howells, had no scruples about
Mark’s ‘Elizabethan breadth of parlance.’“</p>
<p>The Rev. Joseph Twichell, Mark’s most intimate friend for over forty
years, was pastor of the Asylum Hill Congregational Church of Hartford,
which Mark facetiously called the “Church of the Holy Speculators,“
because of its wealthy parishioners. Here Mark had first met “Joe“ at a
social, and their meeting ripened into a glorious, life long friendship.
Twichell was a man of about Mark’s own age, a profound scholar, a devout
Christian, “yet a man with an exuberant sense of humor, and a profound
understanding of the frailties of mankind.“ The Rev. Mr. Twichell
performed the marriage ceremony for Mark Twain and solemnized the births
of his children; “Joe,“ his friend, counseled him on literary as well as
personal matters for the remainder of Mark’s life. It is important to
catch this brief glimpse of the man for whom this masterpiece was
written, for without it one can not fully understand the spirit in which
1601 was written, or the keen enjoyment which Mark and “Joe“ derived
from it.</p>
<p>“SAVE ME ONE.“</p>
<p>The story of the first issue of 1601 is one of finesse, state
diplomacy, and surreptitious printing.</p>
<p>The Rev. “Joe“ Twichell, for whose delectation the piece had been
written, apparently had pocketed the document for four long years. Then,
in 1880, it came into the hands of John Hay, later Secretary of State,
presumably sent to him by Mark Twain. Hay pronounced the sketch a
masterpiece, and wrote immediately to his old Cleveland friend,
Alexander Gunn, prince of connoisseurs in art and literature. The
following correspondence reveals the fine diplomacy which made the name
of John Hay known throughout the world.</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE Washington</p>
<p>June 21, 1880. Dear Gunn:</p>
<p>Are you in Cleveland for all this week? If you will say yes by return
mail, I have a masterpiece to submit to your consideration which is only
in my hands for a few days.</p>
<p>Yours, very much worritted by the depravity of Christendom,</p>
<p>Hay</p>
<p>The second letter discloses Hay’s own high opinion of the effort and
his deep concern for its safety.</p>
<p>June 24, 1880 My dear Gunn:</p>
<p>Here it is. It was written by Mark Twain in a serious effort to bring
back our literature and philosophy to the sober and chaste Elizabethan
standard. But the taste of the present day is too corrupt for anything
so classic. He has not yet been able even to find a publisher. The Globe
has not yet recovered from Downey’s inroad, and they won’t touch it.</p>
<p>I send it to you as one of the few lingering relics of that race of
appreciative critics, who know a good thing when they see it.</p>
<p>Read it with reverence and gratitude and send it back to me; for Mark
is impatient to see once more his wandering offspring.</p>
<p>Yours, Hay.</p>
<p>In his third letter one can almost hear Hay’s chuckle in the
certainty that his diplomatic, if somewhat wicked, suggestion would bear
fruit.</p>
<p>Washington, D. C. July 7, 1880 My dear Gunn:</p>
<p>I have your letter, and the proposition which you make to pull a few
proofs of the masterpiece is highly attractive, and of course highly
immoral. I cannot properly consent to it, and I am afraid the great many
would think I was taking an unfair advantage of his confidence. Please
send back the document as soon as you can, and if, in spite of my
prohibition, you take these proofs, save me one.</p>
<p>Very truly yours, John Hay.</p>
<p>Thus was this Elizabethan dialogue poured into the moulds of cold
type. According to Merle Johnson, Mark Twain’s bibliographer, it was
issued in pamphlet form, without wrappers or covers; there were 8 pages
of text and the pamphlet measured 7 by 8 1/2 inches. Only four copies
are believed to have been printed, one for Hay, one for Gunn, and two
for Twain.</p>
<p>“In the matter of humor,“ wrote Clemens, referring to Hay’s delicious
notes, “what an unsurpassable touch John Hay had!“</p>
<p>HUMOR AT WEST POINT</p>
<p>The first printing of 1601 in actual book form was “Donne at ye
Academie Press,“ in 1882, West Point, New York, under the supervision of
Lieut. C. E. S. Wood, then adjutant of the U. S. Military Academy.</p>
<p>In 1882 Mark Twain and Joe Twichell visited their friend Lieut. Wood
at West Point, where they learned that Wood, as Adjutant, had under his
control a small printing establishment. On Mark’s return to Hartford,
Wood received a letter asking if he would do Mark a great favor by
printing something he had written, which he did not care to entrust to
the ordinary printer. Wood replied that he would be glad to oblige. On
April 3, 1882, Mark sent the manuscript:</p>
<p>“I enclose the original of 1603 [sic] as you suggest. I am afraid
there are errors in it, also, heedlessness in antiquated spelling–e’s
stuck on often at end of words where they are not strickly necessary,
etc….. I would go through the manuscript but I am too much driven just
now, and it is not important anyway. I wish you would do me the kindness
to make any and all corrections that suggest themselves to you.</p>
<p>“Sincerely yours, “S. L. Clemens.“</p>
<p>Charles Erskine Scott Wood recalled in a foreword, which he wrote for
the limited edition of 1601 issued by the Grabhorn Press, how he felt
when he first saw the original manuscript. “When I read it,“ writes
Wood, “I felt that the character of it would be carried a little better
by a printing which pretended to the eye that it was contemporaneous
with the pretended ‘conversation.’</p>
<p>“I wrote Mark that for literary effect I thought there should be a
species of forgery, though of course there was no effort to actually
deceive a scholar. Mark answered that I might do as I liked;–that his
only object was to secure a number of copies, as the demand for it was
becoming burdensome, but he would be very grateful for any interest I
brought to the doing.</p>
<p>“Well, Tucker [foreman of the printing shop] and I soaked some
handmade linen paper in weak coffee, put it as a wet bundle into a warm
room to mildew, dried it to a dampness approved by Tucker and he printed
the ‘copy’ on a hand press. I had special punches cut for such
Elizabethan abbreviations as the a, e, o and u, when followed by m or
n–and for the (commonly and stupidly pronounced ye).</p>
<p>“The only editing I did was as to the spelling and a few old English
words introduced. The spelling, if I remember correctly, is mine, but
the text is exactly as written by Mark. I wrote asking his view of
making the spelling of the period and he was enthusiastic–telling me to
do whatever I thought best and he was greatly pleased with the
result.“</p>
<p>Thus was printed in a de luxe edition of fifty copies the most
curious masterpiece of American humor, at one of America’s most
dignified institutions, the United States Military Academy at West
Point.</p>
<p>“1601 was so be-praised by the archaeological scholars of a quarter
of a century ago,“ wrote Clemens in his letter to Charles Orr, “that I
was rather inordinately vain of it. At that time it had been privately
printed in several countries, among them Japan. A sumptuous edition on
large paper, rough-edged, was made by Lieut. C. E. S. Wood at West Point
–an edition of 50 copies–and distributed among popes and kings and such
people. In England copies of that issue were worth twenty guineas when I
was there six years ago, and none to be had.“</p>
<p>FROM THE DEPTHS</p>
<p>Mark Twain’s irreverence should not be misinterpreted: it was an
irreverence which bubbled up from a deep, passionate insight into the
well-springs of human nature. In 1601, as in ‘The Man That Corrupted
Hadleyburg,’ and in ‘The Mysterious Stranger,’ he tore the masks off
human beings and left them cringing before the public view. With the
deftness of a master surgeon Clemens dealt with human emotions and
delighted in exposing human nature in the raw.</p>
<p>The spirit and the language of the Fireside Conversation were rooted
deep in Mark Twain’s nature and in his life, as C. E. S. Wood, who
printed 1601 at West Point, has pertinently observed,</p>
<p>“If I made a guess as to the intellectual ferment out of which 1601
rose I would say that Mark’s intellectual structure and subconscious
graining was from Anglo-Saxons as primitive as the common man of the
Tudor period. He came from the banks of the Mississippi–from the
flatboatmen, pilots, roustabouts, farmers and village folk of a rude,
primitive people–as Lincoln did.</p>
<p>“He was finished in the mining camps of the West among stage drivers,
gamblers and the men of ’49. The simple roughness of a frontier people
was in his blood and brain.</p>
<p>“Words vulgar and offensive to other ears were a common language to
him. Anyone who ever knew Mark heard him use them freely, forcibly,
picturesquely in his unrestrained conversation. Such language is
forcible as all primitive words are. Refinement seems to make for
weakness–or let us say a cutting edge–but the old vulgar monosyllabic
words bit like the blow of a pioneer’s ax–and Mark was like that. Then I
think 1601 came out of Mark’s instinctive humor, satire and hatred of
puritanism. But there is more than this; with all its humor there is a
sense of real delight in what may be called obscenity for its own sake.
Whitman and the Bible are no more obscene than Nature herself–no more
obscene than a manure pile, out of which come roses and cherries. Every
word used in 1601 was used by our own rude pioneers as a part of their
vocabulary–and no word was ever invented by man with obscene intent, but
only as language to express his meaning. No act of nature is obscene in
itself–but when such words and acts are dragged in for an ulterior
purpose they become offensive, as everything out of place is offensive.
I think he delighted, too, in shocking–giving resounding slaps on what
Chaucer would quite simply call ‘the bare erse.’“</p>
<p>Quite aside from this Chaucerian “erse“ slapping, Clemens had also a
semi-serious purpose, that of reproducing a past time as he saw it in
Shakespeare, Dekker, Jonson, and other writers of the Elizabethan era.
Fireside Conversation was an exercise in scholarship illumined by a keen
sense of character. It was made especially effective by the artistic
arrangement of widely-gathered material into a compressed picture of a
phase of the manners and even the minds of the men and women “in the
spacious times of great Elizabeth.“</p>
<p>Mark Twain made of 1601 a very smart and fascinating performance,
carried over almost to grotesqueness just to show it was not done for
mere delight in the frank naturalism of the functions with which it
deals. That Mark Twain had made considerable study of this frankness is
apparent from chapter four of ‘A Yankee At King Arthur’s Court,’ where
he refers to the conversation at the famous Round Table thus:</p>
<p>“Many of the terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this great
assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen of the land would have made
a Comanche blush. Indelicacy is too mild a term to convey the idea.
However, I had read Tom Jones and Roderick Random and other books of
that kind and knew that the highest and first ladies and gentlemen in
England had remained little or no cleaner in their talk, and in the
morals and conduct which such talk implies, clear up to one hundred
years ago; in fact clear into our own nineteenth century–in which
century, broadly speaking, the earliest samples of the real lady and the
real gentleman discoverable in English history,–or in European history,
for that matter–may be said to have made their appearance. Suppose Sir
Walter [Scott] instead of putting the conversation into the mouths of
his characters, had allowed the characters to speak for themselves? We
should have had talk from Rebecca and Ivanhoe and the soft lady Rowena
which would embarrass a tramp in our day. However, to the unconsciously
indelicate all things are delicate.“</p>
<p>Mark Twain’s interest in history and in the depiction of historical
periods and characters is revealed through his fondness for historical
reading in preference to fiction, and through his other historical
writings. Even in the hilarious, youthful days in San Francisco, Paine
reports that “Clemens, however, was never quite ready for sleep. Then,
as ever, he would prop himself up in bed, light his pipe, and lose
himself in English or French history until his sleep conquered.“ Paine
tells us, too, that Lecky’s ‘European Morals’ was an old favorite.</p>
<p>The notes to ‘The Prince and the Pauper’ show again how carefully
Clemens examined his historical background, and his interest in these
materials. Some of the more important sources are noted: Hume’s ‘History
of England’, Timbs’ ‘Curiosities of London’, J. Hammond Trumbull’s ‘Blue
Laws, True and False’. Apparently Mark Twain relished it, for as Bernard
DeVoto points out, “The book is always Mark Twain. Its parodies of Tudor
speech lapse sometimes into a callow satisfaction in that idiom–Mark
hugely enjoys his nathlesses and beshrews and marrys.“ The writing of
1601 foreshadows his fondness for this treatment.</p>
<p>“Do you suppose the liberties and the Brawn of These States have to
do only with delicate lady-words? with gloved gentleman words“ Walt
Whitman, ‘An American Primer’.</p>
<p>Although 1601 was not matched by any similar sketch in his published
works, it was representative of Mark Twain the man. He was no emaciated
literary tea-tosser. Bronzed and weatherbeaten son of the West, Mark was
a man’s man, and that significant fact is emphasized by the several
phases of Mark’s rich life as steamboat pilot, printer, miner, and
frontier journalist.</p>
<p>On the Virginia City Enterprise Mark learned from editor R. M.
Daggett that “when it was necessary to call a man names, there were no
expletives too long or too expressive to be hurled in rapid succession
to emphasize the utter want of character of the man assailed…. There
were typesetters there who could hurl anathemas at bad copy which would
have frightened a Bengal tiger. The news editor could damn a mutilated
dispatch in twenty-four languages.“</p>
<p>In San Francisco in the sizzling sixties we catch a glimpse of Mark
Twain and his buddy, Steve Gillis, pausing in doorways to sing “The
Doleful Ballad of the Neglected Lover,“ an old piece of uncollected
erotica. One morning, when a dog began to howl, Steve awoke “to find his
room-mate standing in the door that opened out into a back garden,
holding a big revolver, his hand shaking with cold and excitement,“
relates Paine in his Biography.</p>
<p>“‘Come here, Steve,’ he said. ‘I’m so chilled through I can’t get a
bead on him.’</p>
<p>“‘Sam,’ said Steve, ‘don’t shoot him. Just swear at him. You can
easily kill him at any range with your profanity.’</p>
<p>“Steve Gillis declares that Mark Twain let go such a scorching,
singeing blast that the brute’s owner sold him the next day for a
Mexican hairless dog.“</p>
<p>Nor did Mark’s “geysers of profanity“ cease spouting after these gay
and youthful days in San Francisco. With Clemens it may truly be said
that profanity was an art–a pyrotechnic art that entertained
nations.</p>
<p>“It was my duty to keep buttons on his shirts,“ recalled Katy Leary,
life-long housekeeper and friend in the Clemens menage, “and he’d swear
something terrible if I didn’t. If he found a shirt in his drawer
without a button on, he’d take every single shirt out of that drawer and
throw them right out of the window, rain or shine–out of the bathroom
window they’d go. I used to look out every morning to see the
snowflakes–anything white. Out they’d fly…. Oh! he’d swear at anything
when he was on a rampage. He’d swear at his razor if it didn’t cut
right, and Mrs. Clemens used to send me around to the bathroom door
sometimes to knock and ask him what was the matter. Well, I’d go and
knock; I’d say, ‘Mrs. Clemens wants to know what’s the matter.’ And then
he’d say to me (kind of low) in a whisper like, ‘Did she hear me Katy?’
‘Yes,’ I’d say, ‘every word.’ Oh, well, he was ashamed then, he was
afraid of getting scolded for swearing like that, because Mrs. Clemens
hated swearing.“ But his swearing never seemed really bad to Katy Leary,
“It was sort of funny, and a part of him, somehow,“ she said. “Sort of
amusing it was–and gay–not like real swearing, ’cause he swore like an
angel.“</p>
<p>In his later years at Stormfield Mark loved to play his favorite
billiards. “It was sometimes a wonderful and fearsome thing to watch
Mr. Clemens play billiards,“ relates Elizabeth Wallace. “He loved the
game, and he loved to win, but he occasionally made a very bad stroke,
and then the varied, picturesque, and unorthodox vocabulary, acquired in
his more youthful years, was the only thing that gave him comfort.
Gently, slowly, with no profane inflexions of voice, but irresistibly as
though they had the headwaters of the Mississippi for their source, came
this stream of unholy adjectives and choice expletives.“</p>
<p>Mark’s vocabulary ran the whole gamut of life itself. In Paris, in
his appearance in 1879 before the Stomach Club, a jolly lot of gay wags,
Mark’s address, reports Paine, “obtained a wide celebrity among the
clubs of the world, though no line of it, not even its title, has ever
found its way into published literature.“ It is rumored to have been
called “Some Remarks on the Science of Onanism.“</p>
<p>In Berlin, Mark asked Henry W. Fisher to accompany him on an
exploration of the Berlin Royal Library, where the librarian, having
learned that Clemens had been the Kaiser’s guest at dinner, opened the
secret treasure chests for the famous visitor. One of these guarded
treasures was a volume of grossly indecent verses by Voltaire, addressed
to Frederick the Great. “Too much is enough,“ Mark is reported to have
said, when Fisher translated some of the verses, “I would blush to
remember any of these stanzas except to tell Krafft-Ebing about them
when I get to Vienna.“ When Fisher had finished copying a verse for him
Mark put it into his pocket, saying, “Livy [Mark’s wife, Olivia] is so
busy mispronouncing German these days she can’t even attempt to get at
this.“</p>
<p>In his letters, too, Howells observed, “He had the Southwestern, the
Lincolnian, the Elizabethan breadth of parlance, which I suppose one
ought not to call coarse without calling one’s self prudish; and I was
often hiding away in discreet holes and corners the letters in which he
had loosed his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion; I could not bear
to burn them, and I could not, after the first reading, quite bear to
look at them. I shall best give my feeling on this point by saying that
in it he was Shakespearean.“</p>
<p>“With a nigger squat on her safety-valve“ John Hay, Pike County
Ballads.</p>
<p>“Is there any other explanation,“ asks Van Wyck Brooks, “‘of his
Elizabethan breadth of parlance?’ Mr. Howells confesses that he
sometimes blushed over Mark Twain’s letters, that there were some which,
to the very day when he wrote his eulogy on his dead friend, he could
not bear to reread. Perhaps if he had not so insisted, in former years,
while going over Mark Twain’s proofs, upon ‘having that swearing out in
an instant,’ he would never had had cause to suffer from his having
‘loosed his bold fancy to stoop on rank suggestion.’ Mark Twain’s verbal
Rabelaisianism was obviously the expression of that vital sap which, not
having been permitted to inform his work, had been driven inward and
left thereto ferment. No wonder he was always indulging in orgies of
forbidden words. Consider the famous book, 1601, that fireside
conversation in the time of Queen Elizabeth: is there any obsolete
verbal indecency in the English language that Mark Twain has not
painstakingly resurrected and assembled there? He, whose blood was in
constant ferment and who could not contain within the narrow bonds that
had been set for him the roitous exuberance of his nature, had to have
an escape-valve, and he poured through it a fetid stream of meaningless
obscenity–the waste of a priceless psychic material!“ Thus, Brooks lumps
1601 with Mark Twain’s “bawdry,“ and interprets it simply as another
indication of frustration.</p>
<p>FIGS FOR FIG LEAVES!</p>
<p>Of course, the writing of such a piece as 1601 raised the question of
freedom of expression for the creative artist.</p>
<p>Although little discussed at that time, it was a question which
intensely interested Mark, and for a fuller appreciation of Mark’s
position one must keep in mind the year in which 1601 was written, 1876.
There had been nothing like it before in American literature; there had
appeared no Caldwells, no Faulkners, no Hemingways. Victorian England
was gushing Tennyson. In the United States polite letters was a cult of
the Brahmins of Boston, with William Dean Howells at the helm of the
Atlantic. Louisa May Alcott published Little Women in 1868-69, and
Little Men in 1871. In 1873 Mark Twain led the van of the debunkers,
scraping the gilt off the lily in the Gilded Age.</p>
<p>In 1880 Mark took a few pot shots at license in Art and Literature in
his Tramp Abroad, “I wonder why some things are? For instance, Art is
allowed as much indecent license to-day as in earlier times–but the
privileges of Literature in this respect have been sharply curtailed
within the past eighty or ninety years. Fielding and Smollet could
portray the beastliness of their day in the beastliest language; we have
plenty of foul subjects to deal with in our day, but we are not allowed
to approach them very near, even with nice and guarded forms of speech.
But not so with Art. The brush may still deal freely with any subject;
however revolting or indelicate. It makes a body ooze sarcasm at every
pore, to go about Rome and Florence and see what this last generation
has been doing with the statues. These works, which had stood in
innocent nakedness for ages, are all fig-leaved now. Yes, every one of
them. Nobody noticed their nakedness before, perhaps; nobody can help
noticing it now, the fig-leaf makes it so conspicuous. But the comical
thing about it all, is, that the fig-leaf is confined to cold and pallid
marble, which would be still cold and unsuggestive without this sham and
ostentatious symbol of modesty, whereas warm-blooded paintings which do
really need it have in no case been furnished with it.</p>
<p>“At the door of the Ufizzi, in Florence, one is confronted by statues
of a man and a woman, noseless, battered, black with accumulated
grime–they hardly suggest human beings–yet these ridiculous creatures
have been thoughtfully and conscientiously fig-leaved by this fastidious
generation. You enter, and proceed to that most-visited little gallery
that exists in the world…. and there, against the wall, without
obstructing rag or leaf, you may look your fill upon the foulest, the
vilest, the obscenest picture the world possesses–Titian’s Venus. It
isn’t that she is naked and stretched out on a bed–no, it is the
attitude of one of her arms and hand. If I ventured to describe the
attitude, there would be a fine howl–but there the Venus lies, for
anybody to gloat over that wants to–and there she has a right to lie,
for she is a work of art, and Art has its privileges. I saw young girls
stealing furtive glances at her; I saw young men gaze long and
absorbedly at her; I saw aged, infirm men hang upon her charms with a
pathetic interest. How I should like to describe her–just to see what a
holy indignation I could stir up in the world–just to hear the
unreflecting average man deliver himself about my grossness and
coarseness, and all that.</p>
<p>“In every gallery in Europe there are hideous pictures of blood,
carnage, oozing brains, putrefaction–pictures portraying intolerable
suffering –pictures alive with every conceivable horror, wrought out in
dreadful detail–and similar pictures are being put on the canvas every
day and publicly exhibited–without a growl from anybody–for they are
innocent, they are inoffensive, being works of art. But suppose a
literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate
description of one of these grisly things–the critics would skin him
alive. Well, let it go, it cannot be helped; Art retains her privileges,
Literature has lost hers. Somebody else may cipher out the whys and the
wherefores and the consistencies of it–I haven’t got time.“</p>
<p>PROFESSOR SCENTS PORNOGRAPHY</p>
<p>Unfortunately, 1601 has recently been tagged by Professor Edward
Wagenknecht as “the most famous piece of pornography in American
literature.“ Like many another uninformed, Prof. W. is like the little
boy who is shocked to see “naughty“ words chalked on the back fence, and
thinks they are pornography. The initiated, after years of wading
through the mire, will recognize instantly the significant difference
between filthy filth and funny “filth.“ Dirt for dirt’s sake is
something else again. Pornography, an eminent American jurist has
pointed out, is distinguished by the “leer of the sensualist.“</p>
<p>“The words which are criticised as dirty,“ observed justice John M.
Woolsey in the United States District Court of New York, lifting the ban
on Ulysses by James Joyce, “are old Saxon words known to almost all men
and, I venture, to many women, and are such words as would be naturally
and habitually used, I believe, by the types of folk whose life,
physical and mental, Joyce is seeking to describe.“ Neither was there
“pornographic intent,“ according to justice Woolsey, nor was Ulysses
obscene within the legal definition of that word.</p>
<p>“The meaning of the word ‘obscene,’“ the Justice indicated, “as
legally defined by the courts is: tending to stir the sex impulses or to
lead to sexually impure and lustful thoughts.</p>
<p>“Whether a particular book would tend to excite such impulses and
thoughts must be tested by the court’s opinion as to its effect on a
person with average sex instincts–what the French would call ‘l’homme
moyen sensuel’–who plays, in this branch of legal inquiry, the same role
of hypothetical reagent as does the ‘reasonable man’ in the law of torts
and ‘the learned man in the art’ on questions of invention in patent
law.“</p>
<p>Obviously, it is ridiculous to say that the “leer of the sensualist“
lurks in the pages of Mark Twain’s 1601.</p>
<p>DROLL STORY</p>
<p>“In a way,“ observed William Marion Reedy, “1601 is to Twain’s whole
works what the ‘Droll Stories’ are to Balzac’s. It is better than the
privately circulated ribaldry and vulgarity of Eugene Field; is, indeed,
an essay in a sort of primordial humor such as we find in Rabelais, or
in the plays of some of the lesser stars that drew their light from
Shakespeare’s urn. It is humor or fun such as one expects, let us say,
from the peasants of Thomas Hardy, outside of Hardy’s books. And, though
it be filthy, it yet hath a splendor of mere animalism of good spirits…
I would say it is scatalogical rather than erotic, save for one touch
toward the end. Indeed, it seems more of Rabelais than of Boccaccio or
Masuccio or Aretino–is brutally British rather than lasciviously
latinate, as to the subjects, but sumptuous as regards the
language.“</p>
<p>Immediately upon first reading, John Hay, later Secretary of State,
had proclaimed 1601 a masterpiece. Albert Bigelow Paine, Mark Twain’s
biographer, likewise acknowledged its greatness, when he said, “1601 is
a genuine classic, as classics of that sort go. It is better than the
gross obscenities of Rabelais, and perhaps in some day to come, the
taste that justified Gargantua and the Decameron will give this literary
refugee shelter and setting among the more conventional writing of Mark
Twain. Human taste is a curious thing; delicacy is purely a matter of
environment and point of view.“</p>
<p>“It depends on who writes a thing whether it is coarse or not,“ wrote
Clemens in his notebook in 1879. “I built a conversation which could
have happened–I used words such as were used at that time–1601. I sent
it anonymously to a magazine, and how the editor abused it and the
sender!“</p>
<p>But that man was a praiser of Rabelais and had been saying, ‘O that
we had a Rabelais!’ I judged that I could furnish him one.</p>
<p>“Then I took it to one of the greatest, best and most learned of
Divines [Rev. Joseph H. Twichell] and read it to him. He came within an
ace of killing himself with laughter (for between you and me the thing
was dreadfully funny. I don’t often write anything that I laugh at
myself, but I can hardly think of that thing without laughing). That old
Divine said it was a piece of the finest kind of literary art–and David
Gray of the Buffalo Courier said it ought to be printed privately and
left behind me when I died, and then my fame as a literary artist would
last.“</p>

the Pepys of that day, the same being Queen Elizabeth’s cup-bearer. He
is supposed to be of ancient and noble lineage; that he despises these
literary canaille; that his soul consumes with wrath, to see the queen

<p>YESTERNIGHT toke her maiste ye queene a fantasie such as she
sometimes hath, and had to her closet certain that doe write playes,
bokes, and such like, these being my lord Bacon, his worship Sir Walter
Ralegh, Mr. Ben Jonson, and ye child Francis Beaumonte, which being but
sixteen, hath yet turned his hand to ye doing of ye Lattin masters into
our Englishe tong, with grete discretion and much applaus. Also came
with these ye famous Shaxpur. A righte straunge mixing truly of mighty
blode with mean, ye more in especial since ye queenes grace was present,
as likewise these following, to wit: Ye Duchess of Bilgewater,
twenty-two yeres of age; ye Countesse of Granby, twenty-six; her doter,
ye Lady Helen, fifteen; as also these two maides of honor, to-wit, ye
Lady Margery Boothy, sixty-five, and ye Lady Alice Dilberry, turned
seventy, she being two yeres ye queenes graces elder.</p>
<p>I being her maites cup-bearer, had no choice but to remaine and
beholde rank forgot, and ye high holde converse wh ye low as uppon equal
termes, a grete scandal did ye world heare thereof.</p>
<p>In ye heat of ye talk it befel yt one did breake wind, yielding an
exceding mightie and distresfull stink, whereat all did laugh full sore,
and then–</p>
<p>Ye Queene.–Verily in mine eight and sixty yeres have I not heard the
fellow to this fart. Meseemeth, by ye grete sound and clamour of it, it
was male; yet ye belly it did lurk behinde shoulde now fall lean and
flat against ye spine of him yt hath bene delivered of so stately and so
waste a bulk, where as ye guts of them yt doe quiff-splitters bear,
stand comely still and rounde. Prithee let ye author confess ye
offspring. Will my Lady Alice testify?</p>
<p>Lady Alice.–Good your grace, an’ I had room for such a thundergust
within mine ancient bowels, ’tis not in reason I coulde discharge ye
same and live to thank God for yt He did choose handmaid so humble
whereby to shew his power. Nay, ’tis not I yt have broughte forth this
rich o’ermastering fog, this fragrant gloom, so pray you seeke ye
further.</p>
<p>Ye Queene.–Mayhap ye Lady Margery hath done ye companie this
favor?</p>
<p>Lady Margery.–So please you madam, my limbs are feeble wh ye weighte
and drouth of five and sixty winters, and it behoveth yt I be tender
unto them. In ye good providence of God, an’ I had contained this
wonder, forsoothe wolde I have gi’en ’ye whole evening of my sinking
life to ye dribbling of it forth, with trembling and uneasy soul, not
launched it sudden in its matchless might, taking mine own life with
violence, rending my weak frame like rotten rags. It was not I, your
maisty.</p>
<p>Ye Queene.–O’ God’s name, who hath favored us? Hath it come to pass
yt a fart shall fart itself? Not such a one as this, I trow. Young
Master Beaumont–but no; ’twould have wafted him to heaven like down of
goose’s boddy. ’Twas not ye little Lady Helen–nay, ne’er blush, my
child; thoul’t tickle thy tender maidenhedde with many a mousie-squeak
before thou learnest to blow a harricane like this. Wasn’t you, my
learned and ingenious Jonson?</p>
<p>Jonson.–So fell a blast hath ne’er mine ears saluted, nor yet a
stench so all-pervading and immortal. ’Twas not a novice did it, good
your maisty, but one of veteran experience–else hadde he failed of
confidence. In sooth it was not I.</p>
<p>Ye Queene.–My lord Bacon?</p>
<p>Lord Bacon.-Not from my leane entrailes hath this prodigy burst
forth, so please your grace. Naught doth so befit ye grete as grete
performance; and haply shall ye finde yt ’tis not from mediocrity this
miracle hath issued.</p>
<p>[Tho’ ye subjoct be but a fart, yet will this tedious sink of
learning pondrously phillosophize. Meantime did the foul and deadly
stink pervade all places to that degree, yt never smelt I ye like, yet
dare I not to leave ye presence, albeit I was like to suffocate.]</p>
<p>Ye Queene.–What saith ye worshipful Master Shaxpur?</p>
<p>Shaxpur.–In the great hand of God I stand and so proclaim mine
innocence. Though ye sinless hosts of heaven had foretold ye coming of
this most desolating breath, proclaiming it a work of uninspired man,
its quaking thunders, its firmament-clogging rottenness his own
achievement in due course of nature, yet had not I believed it; but had
said the pit itself hath furnished forth the stink, and heaven’s
artillery hath shook the globe in admiration of it.</p>
<p>[Then was there a silence, and each did turn him toward the
worshipful Sr Walter Ralegh, that browned, embattled, bloody
swashbuckler, who rising up did smile, and simpering say,]</p>
<p>Sr W.–Most gracious maisty, ’twas I that did it, but indeed it was so
poor and frail a note, compared with such as I am wont to furnish, yt in
sooth I was ashamed to call the weakling mine in so august a presence.
It was nothing–less than nothing, madam–I did it but to clear my nether
throat; but had I come prepared, then had I delivered something worthy.
Bear with me, please your grace, till I can make amends.</p>
<p>[Then delivered he himself of such a godless and rock-shivering blast
that all were fain to stop their ears, and following it did come so
dense and foul a stink that that which went before did seem a poor and
trifling thing beside it. Then saith he, feigning that he blushed and
was confused, I perceive that I am weak to-day, and cannot justice do
unto my powers; and sat him down as who should say, There, it is not
much yet he that hath an arse to spare, let him fellow that, an’ he
think he can. By God, an’ I were ye queene, I would e’en tip this
swaggering braggart out o’ the court, and let him air his grandeurs and
break his intolerable wind before ye deaf and such as suffocation
pleaseth.]</p>
<p>Then fell they to talk about ye manners and customs of many peoples,
and Master Shaxpur spake of ye boke of ye sieur Michael de Montaine,
wherein was mention of ye custom of widows of Perigord to wear uppon ye
headdress, in sign of widowhood, a jewel in ye similitude of a man’s
member wilted and limber, whereat ye queene did laugh and say widows in
England doe wear prickes too, but betwixt the thighs, and not wilted
neither, till coition hath done that office for them. Master Shaxpur did
likewise observe how yt ye sieur de Montaine hath also spoken of a
certain emperor of such mighty prowess that he did take ten maidenheddes
in ye compass of a single night, ye while his empress did entertain two
and twenty lusty knights between her sheetes, yet was not satisfied;
whereat ye merrie Countess Granby saith a ram is yet ye emperor’s
superior, sith he wil tup above a hundred yewes ’twixt sun and sun; and
after, if he can have none more to shag, will masturbate until he hath
enrich’d whole acres with his seed.</p>
<p>Then spake ye damned windmill, Sr Walter, of a people in ye uttermost
parts of America, yt capulate not until they be five and thirty yeres of
age, ye women being eight and twenty, and do it then but once in seven
yeres.</p>
<p>Ye Queene.–How doth that like my little Lady Helen? Shall we send
thee thither and preserve thy belly?</p>
<p>Lady Helen.–Please your highnesses grace, mine old nurse hath told me
there are more ways of serving God than by locking the thighs together;
yet am I willing to serve him yt way too, sith your highnesses grace
hath set ye ensample.</p>
<p>Ye Queene.–God’ wowndes a good answer, childe.</p>
<p>Lady Alice.–Mayhap ’twill weaken when ye hair sprouts below ye
navel.</p>
<p>Lady Helen.–Nay, it sprouted two yeres syne; I can scarce more than
cover it with my hand now.</p>
<p>Ye Queene.–Hear Ye that, my little Beaumonte? Have ye not a little
birde about ye that stirs at hearing tell of so sweete a neste?</p>
<p>Beaumonte.–’Tis not insensible, illustrious madam; but mousing owls
and bats of low degree may not aspire to bliss so whelming and ecstatic
as is found in ye downy nests of birdes of Paradise.</p>
<p>Ye Queene.–By ye gullet of God, ‘tis a neat-turned compliment. With
such a tongue as thine, lad, thou’lt spread the ivory thighs of many a
willing maide in thy good time, an’ thy cod-piece be as handy as thy
speeche.</p>
<p>Then spake ye queene of how she met old Rabelais when she was turned
of fifteen, and he did tell her of a man his father knew that had a
double pair of bollocks, whereon a controversy followed as concerning
the most just way to spell the word, ye contention running high betwixt
ye learned Bacon and ye ingenious Jonson, until at last ye old Lady
Margery, wearying of it all, saith, ‘Gentles, what mattereth it how ye
shall spell the word? I warrant Ye when ye use your bollocks ye shall
not think of it; and my Lady Granby, be ye content; let the spelling be,
ye shall enjoy the beating of them on your buttocks just the same, I
trow. Before I had gained my fourteenth year I had learnt that them that
would explore a cunt stop’d not to consider the spelling o’t.’</p>
<p>Sr W.–In sooth, when a shift’s turned up, delay is meet for naught
but dalliance. Boccaccio hath a story of a priest that did beguile a
maid into his cell, then knelt him in a corner to pray for grace to be
rightly thankful for this tender maidenhead ye Lord had sent him; but ye
abbot, spying through ye key-hole, did see a tuft of brownish hair with
fair white flesh about it, wherefore when ye priest’s prayer was done,
his chance was gone, forasmuch as ye little maid had but ye one cunt,
and that was already occupied to her content.</p>
<p>Then conversed they of religion, and ye mightie work ye old dead
Luther did doe by ye grace of God. Then next about poetry, and Master
Shaxpur did rede a part of his King Henry IV., ye which, it seemeth unto
me, is not of ye value of an arsefull of ashes, yet they praised it
bravely, one and all.</p>
<p>Ye same did rede a portion of his “Venus and Adonis,“ to their
prodigious admiration, whereas I, being sleepy and fatigued withal, did
deme it but paltry stuff, and was the more discomforted in that ye blody
bucanier had got his wind again, and did turn his mind to farting with
such villain zeal that presently I was like to choke once more. God damn
this windy ruffian and all his breed. I wolde that hell mighte get
him.</p>
<p>They talked about ye wonderful defense which old Sr. Nicholas
Throgmorton did make for himself before ye judges in ye time of Mary;
which was unlucky matter to broach, sith it fetched out ye quene with a
‘Pity yt he, having so much wit, had yet not enough to save his doter’s
maidenhedde sound for her marriage-bed.’ And ye quene did give ye damn’d
Sr. Walter a look yt made hym wince–for she hath not forgot he was her
own lover it yt olde day. There was silent uncomfortableness now; ’twas
not a good turn for talk to take, sith if ye queene must find offense in
a little harmless debauching, when pricks were stiff and cunts not
loathe to take ye stiffness out of them, who of this company was
sinless; behold, was not ye wife of Master Shaxpur four months gone with
child when she stood uppe before ye altar? Was not her Grace of
Bilgewater roger’d by four lords before she had a husband? Was not ye
little Lady Helen born on her mother’s wedding-day? And, beholde, were
not ye Lady Alice and ye Lady Margery there, mouthing religion, whores
from ye cradle?</p>
<p>In time came they to discourse of Cervantes, and of the new painter,
Rubens, that is beginning to be heard of. Fine words and dainty-wrought
phrases from the ladies now, one or two of them being, in other days,
pupils of that poor ass, Lille, himself; and I marked how that Jonson
and Shaxpur did fidget to discharge some venom of sarcasm, yet dared
they not in the presence, the queene’s grace being ye very flower of ye
Euphuists herself. But behold, these be they yt, having a specialty, and
admiring it in themselves, be jealous when a neighbor doth essaye it,
nor can abide it in them long. Wherefore ‘twas observable yt ye quene
waxed uncontent; and in time labor’d grandiose speeche out of ye mouth
of Lady Alice, who manifestly did mightily pride herself thereon, did
quite exhauste ye quene’s endurance, who listened till ye gaudy speeche
was done, then lifted up her brows, and with vaste irony, mincing saith
’O shit!’ Whereat they alle did laffe, but not ye Lady Alice, yt olde
foolish bitche.</p>
<p>Now was Sr. Walter minded of a tale he once did hear ye ingenious
Margrette of Navarre relate, about a maid, which being like to suffer
rape by an olde archbishoppe, did smartly contrive a device to save her
maidenhedde, and said to him, First, my lord, I prithee, take out thy
holy tool and piss before me; which doing, lo his member felle, and
would not rise again.</p>
<p>FOOTNOTES To Frivolity</p>
<p>The historical consistency of 1601 indicates that Twain must have
given the subject considerable thought. The author was careful to speak
only of men who conceivably might have been in the Virgin Queen’s closet
and engaged in discourse with her.</p>
<p>THE CHARACTERS</p>
<p>At this time (1601) Queen Elizabeth was 68 years old. She speaks of
having talked to “old Rabelais“ in her youth. This might have been
possible as Rabelais died in 1552, when the Queen was 19 years old.</p>
<p>Among those in the party were Shakespeare, at that time 37 years old;
Ben Jonson, 27; and Sir Walter Raleigh, 49. Beaumont at the time was 17,
not 16. He was admitted as a member of the Inner Temple in 1600, and his
first translations, those from Ovid, were first published in 1602.
Therefore, if one were holding strictly to the year date, neither by age
nor by fame would Beaumont have been eligible to attend such a gathering
of august personages in the year 1601; but the point is unimportant.</p>
<p>THE ELIZABETHAN WRITERS</p>
<p>In the Conversation Shakespeare speaks of Montaigne’s Essays. These
were first published in 1580 and successive editions were issued in the
years following, the third volume being published in 1588. “In England
Montaigne was early popular. It was long supposed that the autograph of
Shakespeare in a copy of Florio’s translation showed his study of the
Essays. The autograph has been disputed, but divers passages, and
especially one in The Tempest, show that at first or second hand the
poet was acquainted with the essayist.“ (Encyclopedia Brittanica.)</p>
<p>The company at the Queen’s fireside discoursed of Lilly (or Lyly),
English dramatist and novelist of the Elizabethan era, whose novel,
Euphues, published in two parts, ‘Euphues’, or the ‘Anatomy of Wit’
(1579) and ‘Euphues and His England’ (1580) was a literary sensation. It
is said to have influenced literary style for more than a quarter of a
century, and traces of its influence are found in Shakespeare. (Columbia
Encyclopedia).</p>
<p>The introduction of Ben Jonson into the party was wholly appropriate,
if one may call to witness some of Jonson’s writings. The subject under
discussion was one that Jonson was acquainted with, in The
Alchemist:</p>
<p>Act. I, Scene I,</p>
<p>FACE: Believe’t I will.</p>
<p>SUBTLE: Thy worst. I fart at thee.</p>
<p>DOL COMMON: Have you your wits? Why, gentlemen, for love—-</p>
<p>Act. 2, Scene I,</p>
<p>SIR EPICURE MAMMON: ….and then my poets, the same that writ so subtly
of the fart, whom I shall entertain still for that subject and again in
Bartholomew Fair</p>
<p>NIGHTENGALE: (sings a ballad) Hear for your love, and buy for your
money. A delicate ballad o’ the ferret and the coney. A preservative
again’ the punk’s evil. Another goose-green starch, and the devil. A
dozen of divine points, and the godly garter The fairing of good
counsel, of an ell and three-quarters. What is’t you buy? The windmill
blown down by the witche’s fart, Or Saint George, that, O! did break the
dragon’s heart.</p>
<p>GOOD OLD ENGLISH CUSTOM</p>
<p>That certain types of English society have not changed materially in
their freedom toward breaking wind in public can be noticed in some
comparatively recent literature. Frank Harris in My Life, Vol. 2, Ch.
XIII, tells of Lady Marriott, wife of a judge Advocate General, being
compelled to leave her own table, at which she was entertaining Sir
Robert Fowler, then the Lord Mayor of London, because of the suffocating
and nauseating odors there. He also tells of an instance in parliament,
and of a rather brilliant bon mot spoken upon that occasion.</p>
<p>“While Fowler was speaking Finch-Hatton had shewn signs of
restlessness; towards the end of the speech he had moved some three
yards away from the Baronet. As soon as Fowler sat down Finch-Hatton
sprang up holding his handkerchief to his nose:</p>
<p>“‘Mr. Speaker,’ he began, and was at once acknowledged by the
Speaker, for it was a maiden speech, and as such was entitled to
precedence by the courteous custom of the House, ‘I know why the Right
Honourable Member from the City did not conclude his speech with a
proposal. The only way to conclude such a speech appropriately would be
with a motion!’“</p>
<p>AEOLIAN CREPITATIONS</p>
<p>But society had apparently degenerated sadly in modern times, and
even in the era of Elizabeth, for at an earlier date it was a
serious–nay, capital–offense to break wind in the presence of majesty.
The Emperor Claudius, hearing that one who had suppressed the urge while
paying him court had suffered greatly thereby, “intended to issue an
edict, allowing to all people the liberty of giving vent at table to any
distension occasioned by flatulence:“</p>
<p>Martial, too (Book XII, Epigram LXXVII), tells of the embarrassment
of one who broke wind while praying in the Capitol,</p>
<p>“One day, while standing upright, addressing his prayers to Jupiter,
Aethon farted in the Capitol. Men laughed, but the Father of the Gods,
offended, condemned the guilty one to dine at home for three nights.
Since that time, miserable Aethon, when he wishes to enter the Capitol,
goes first to Paterclius’ privies and farts ten or twenty times. Yet, in
spite of this precautionary crepitation, he salutes Jove with
constricted buttocks.“ Martial also (Book IV, Epigram LXXX), ridicules a
woman who was subject to the habit, saying,</p>
<p>“Your Bassa, Fabullus, has always a child at her side, calling it her
darling and her plaything; and yet–more wonder–she does not care for
children. What is the reason then. Bassa is apt to fart. (For which she
could blame the unsuspecting infant.)“</p>
<p>The tale is told, too, of a certain woman who performed an aeolian
crepitation at a dinner attended by the witty Monsignieur Dupanloup,
Bishop of Orleans, and that when, to cover up her lapse, she began to
scrape her feet upon the floor, and to make similar noises, the Bishop
said, “Do not trouble to find a rhyme, Madam!“</p>
<p>Nay, worthier names than those of any yet mentioned have discussed
the matter. Herodotus tells of one such which was the precursor to the
fall of an empire and a change of dynasty–that which Amasis discharges
while on horseback, and bids the envoy of Apries, King of Egypt, catch
and deliver to his royal master. Even the exact manner and posture of
Amasis, author of this insult, is described.</p>
<p>St. Augustine (The City of God, XIV:24) cites the instance of a man
who could command his rear trumpet to sound at will, which his learned
commentator fortifies with the example of one who could do so in
tune!</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin, in his “Letter to the Royal Academy of Brussels“
has canvassed suggested remedies for alleviating the stench attendant
upon these discharges:</p>
<p>“My Prize Question therefore should be: To discover some Drug,
wholesome and–not disagreeable, to be mixed with our common food, or
sauces, that shall render the natural discharges of Wind from our Bodies
not only inoffensive, but agreeable as Perfumes.</p>
<p>“That this is not a Chimerical Project andandandand altogether
impossible, may appear from these considerations. That we already have
some knowledge of means capable of varying that smell. He that dines on
stale Flesh, especially with much Addition of Onions, shall be able to
afford a stink that no Company can tolerate; while he that has lived for
some time on Vegetables only, shall have that Breath so pure as to be
insensible of the most delicate Noses; and if he can manage so as to
avoid the Report, he may anywhere give vent to his Griefs, unnoticed.
But as there are many to whom an entire Vegetable Diet would be
inconvenient, andandandand as a little quick Lime thrown into a Jakes
will correct the amazing Quantity of fetid Air arising from the vast
Mass of putrid Matter contained in such Places, and render it pleasing
to the Smell, who knows but that a little Powder of Lime (or some other
equivalent) taken in our Food, or perhaps a Glass of Lime Water drank at
Dinner, may have the same Effect on the Air produced in and issuing from
our Bowels?“</p>
<p>One curious commentary on the text is that Elizabeth should be so
fond of investigating into the authorship of the exhalation in question,
when she was inordinately fond of strong and sweet perfumes; in fact,
she was responsible for the tremendous increase in importations of
scents into England during her reign.</p>
<p>“YE BOKE OF YE SIEUR MICHAEL DE MONTAINE“</p>
<p>There is a curious admixture of error and misunderstanding in this
part of the sketch. In the first place, the story is borrowed from
Montaigne, where it is told inaccurately, and then further corrupted in
the telling.</p>
<p>It was not the good widows of Perigord who wore the phallus upon
their coifs; it was the young married women, of the district near
Montaigne’s home, who paraded it to view upon their foreheads, as a
symbol, says our essayist, “of the joy they derived therefrom.“ If they
became widows, they reversed its position, and covered it up with the
rest of their head-dress.</p>
<p>The “emperor“ mentioned was not an emperor; he was Procolus, a native
of Albengue, on the Genoese coast, who, with Bonosus, led the
unsuccessful rebellion in Gaul against Emperor Probus. Even so keen a
commentator as Cotton has failed to note the error.</p>
<p>The empress (Montaigne does not say “his empress“) was Messalina,
third wife of the Emperor Claudius, who was uncle of Caligula and
foster-father to Nero. Furthermore, in her case the charge is that she
copulated with twenty-five in a single night, and not twenty-two, as
appears in the text. Montaigne is right in his statistics, if original
sources are correct, whereas the author erred in transcribing the
incident.</p>
<p>As for Proculus, it has been noted that he was associated with
Bonosus, who was as renowned in the field of Bacchus as was Proculus in
that of Venus (Gibbon, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire). The feat
of Proculus is told in his own words, in Vopiscus, (Hist. Augustine,
p. 246) where he recounts having captured one hundred Sarmatian virgins,
and unmaidened ten of them in one night, together with the happenings
subsequent thereto.</p>
<p>Concerning Messalina, there appears to be no question but that she
was a nymphomaniac, and that, while Empress of Rome, she participated in
some fearful debaucheries. The question is what to believe, for much
that we have heard about her is almost certainly apocryphal.</p>
<p>The author from whom Montaigne took his facts is the elder Pliny,
who, in his Natural History, Book X, Chapter 83, says, “Other animals
become sated with veneral pleasures; man hardly knows any satiety.
Messalina, the wife of Claudius Caesar, thinking this a palm quite
worthy of an empress, selected for the purpose of deciding the question,
one of the most notorious women who followed the profession of a hired
prostitute; and the empress outdid her, after continuous intercourse,
night and day, at the twenty-fifth embrace.“</p>
<p>But Pliny, notwithstanding his great attainments, was often a
retailer of stale gossip, and in like case was Aurelius Victor, another
writer who heaped much odium on her name. Again, there is a great hiatus
in the Annals of Tacitus, a true historian, at the period covering the
earlier days of the Empress; while Suetonius, bitter as he may be, is
little more than an anecdotist. Juvenal, another of her detractors, is a
prejudiced witness, for he started out to satirize female vice, and
naturally aimed at high places. Dio also tells of Messalina’s misdeeds,
but his work is under the same limitations as that of Suetonius.
Furthermore, none but Pliny mentions the excess under consideration.</p>
<p>However, “where there is much smoke there must be a little fire,“ and
based upon the superimposed testimony of the writers of the period,
there appears little doubt but that Messalina was a nymphomaniac, that
she prostituted herself in the public stews, naked, and with gilded
nipples, and that she did actually marry her chief adulterer, Silius,
while Claudius was absent at Ostia, and that the wedding was consummated
in the presence of a concourse of witnesses. This was “the straw that
broke the camel’s back.“ Claudius hastened back to Rome, Silius was
dispatched, and Messalina, lacking the will-power to destroy herself,
was killed when an officer ran a sword through her abdomen, just as it
appeared that Claudius was about to relent.</p>
<p>“THEN SPAKE YE DAMNED WINDMILL, SIR WALTER“</p>
<p>Raleigh is thoroughly in character here; this observation is quite in
keeping with the general veracity of his account of his travels in
Guiana, one of the most mendacious accounts of adventure ever told.
Naturally, the scholarly researches of Westermarck have failed to
discover this people; perhaps Lady Helen might best be protected among
the Jibaros of Ecuador, where the men marry when approaching forty.</p>
<p>Ben Jonson in his Conversations observed “That Sr. W. Raughlye
esteemed more of fame than of conscience.“</p>
<p>YE VIRGIN QUEENE</p>
<p>Grave historians have debated for centuries the pretensions of
Elizabeth to the title, “The Virgin Queen,“ and it is utterly impossible
to dispose of the issue in a note. However, the weight of opinion
appears to be in the negative. Many and great were the difficulties
attending the marriage of a Protestant princess in those troublous
times, and Elizabeth finally announced that she would become wedded to
the English nation, and she wore a ring in token thereof until her
death. However, more or less open liaisons with Essex and Leicester, as
well as a host of lesser courtiers, her ardent temperament, and her
imperious temper, are indications that cannot be denied in determining
any estimate upon the point in question.</p>
<p>Ben Jonson in his Conversations with William Drummond of Hawthornden
says,</p>
<p>“Queen Elizabeth never saw herself after she became old in a true
glass; they painted her, and sometymes would vermillion her nose. She
had allwayes about Christmass evens set dice that threw sixes or five,
and she knew not they were other, to make her win and esteame herself
fortunate. That she had a membrana on her, which made her uncapable of
man, though for her delight she tried many. At the comming over of
Monsieur, there was a French Chirurgion who took in hand to cut it, yett
fear stayed her, and his death.“</p>
<p>It was a subject which again intrigued Clemens when he was abroad
with W. H. Fisher, whom Mark employed to “nose up“ everything pertaining
to Queen Elizabeth’s manly character.</p>
<p>“’BOCCACCIO HATH A STORY“</p>
<p>The author does not pay any great compliment to Raleigh’s memory
here. There is no such tale in all Boccaccio. The nearest related
incident forms the subject matter of Dineo’s novel (the fourth) of the
First day of the Decameron.</p>
<p>OLD SR. NICHOLAS THROGMORTON</p>
<p>The incident referred to appears to be Sir Nicholas Throgmorton’s
trial for complicity in the attempt to make Lady Jane Grey Queen of
England, a charge of which he was acquitted. This so angered Queen Mary
that she imprisoned him in the Tower, and fined the jurors from one to
two thousand pounds each. Her action terrified succeeding juries, so
that Sir Nicholas’s brother was condemned on no stronger evidence than
that which had failed to prevail before. While Sir Nicholas’s defense
may have been brilliant, it must be admitted that the evidence was weak.
He was later released from the Tower, and under Elizabeth was one of a
group of commissioners sent by that princess into Scotland, to foment
trouble with Mary, Queen of Scots. When the attempt became known,
Elizabeth repudiated the acts of her agents, but Sir Nicholas, having
anticipated this possibility, had sufficient foresight to secure
endorsement of his plan by the Council, and so outwitted Elizabeth, who
was playing a two-faced role, and Cecil, one of the greatest statesmen
who ever held the post of principal minister. Perhaps it was this
incident to which the company referred, which might in part explain
Elizabeth’s rejoinder. However, he had been restored to confidence ere
this, and had served as ambassador to France.</p>
<p>“TO SAVE HIS DOTER’S MAIDENHEDDE“</p>
<p>Elizabeth Throckmorton (or Throgmorton), daughter of Sir Nicholas,
was one of Elizabeth’s maids of honor. When it was learned that she had
been debauched by Raleigh, Sir Walter was recalled from his command at
sea by the Queen, and compelled to marry the girl. This was not “in that
olde daie,“ as the text has it, for it happened only eight years before
the date of this purported “conversation,“ when Elizabeth was sixty
years old.</p>
<p>PARTIAL BIBLIOGRAPHY</p>
<p>The various printings of 1601 reveal how Mark Twain’s ‘Fireside
Conversation’ has become a part of the American printer’s lore. But more
important, its many printings indicate that it has become a popular bit
of American folklore, particularly for men and women who have a feeling
for Mark Twain. Apparently it appeals to the typographer, who devotes to
it his worthy art, as well as to the job printer, who may pull a crudely
printed proof. The gay procession of curious printings of 1601 is unique
in the history of American printing.</p>
<p>Indeed, the story of the various printings of 1601 is almost
legendary. In the days of the “jour.“ printer, so I am told,
well-thumbed copies were carried from print shop to print shop. For more
than a quarter century now it has been one of the chief sources of
enjoyment for printers’ devils; and many a young rascal has learned
about life from this Fireside Conversation. It has been printed all over
the country, and if report is to be believed, in foreign countries as
well. Because of the many surreptitious and anonymous printings it is
exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to compile a complete
bibliography. Many printings lack the name of the publisher, the
printer, the place or date of printing. In many instances some of the
data, through the patient questioning of fellow collectors, has been
obtained and supplied.</p>
