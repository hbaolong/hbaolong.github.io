<h4 id="chapter-xxv.">CHAPTER XXV.</h4>
<p>THE FIRST NEWSPAPER</p>
<p>When I told the king I was going out disguised as a petty freeman to
scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life of the
people, he was all afire with the novelty of the thing in a minute, and
was bound to take a chance in the adventure himself–nothing should stop
him–he would drop everything and go along–it was the prettiest idea he
had run across for many a day. He wanted to glide out the back way and
start at once; but I showed him that that wouldn’t answer. You see, he
was billed for the king’s-evil–to touch for it, I mean–and it wouldn’t
be right to disappoint the house and it wouldn’t make a delay worth
considering, anyway, it was only a one-night stand. And I thought he
ought to tell the queen he was going away. He clouded up at that and
looked sad. I was sorry I had spoken, especially when he said
mournfully:</p>
<p>“Thou forgettest that Launcelot is here; and where Launcelot is, she
noteth not the going forth of the king, nor what day he returneth.“</p>
<p>Of course, I changed the Subject. Yes, Guenever was beautiful, it is
true, but take her all around she was pretty slack. I never meddled in
these matters, they weren’t my affair, but I did hate to see the way
things were going on, and I don’t mind saying that much. Many’s the time
she had asked me, “Sir Boss, hast seen Sir Launcelot about?“ but if ever
she went fretting around for the king I didn’t happen to be around at
the time.</p>
<p>There was a very good lay-out for the king’s-evil business–very tidy
and creditable. The king sat under a canopy of state; about him were
clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals. Conspicuous,
both for location and personal outfit, stood Marinel, a hermit of the
quack-doctor species, to introduce the sick. All abroad over the
spacious floor, and clear down to the doors, in a thick jumble, lay or
sat the scrofulous, under a strong light. It was as good as a tableau;
in fact, it had all the look of being gotten up for that, though it
wasn’t. There were eight hundred sick people present. The work was slow;
it lacked the interest of novelty for me, because I had seen the
ceremonies before; the thing soon became tedious, but the proprieties
required me to stick it out. The doctor was there for the reason that in
all such crowds there were many people who only imagined something was
the matter with them, and many who were consciously sound but wanted the
immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king, and yet others who
pretended to illness in order to get the piece of coin that went with
the touch. Up to this time this coin had been a wee little gold piece
worth about a third of a dollar. When you consider how much that amount
of money would buy, in that age and country, and how usual it was to be
scrofulous, when not dead, you would understand that the annual
king’s-evil appropriation was just the River and Harbor bill of that
government for the grip it took on the treasury and the chance it
afforded for skinning the surplus. So I had privately concluded to touch
the treasury itself for the king’s-evil. I covered six-sevenths of the
appropriation into the treasury a week before starting from Camelot on
my adventures, and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into
five-cent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk of the
King’s Evil Department; a nickel to take the place of each gold coin,
you see, and do its work for it. It might strain the nickel some, but I
judged it could stand it. As a rule, I do not approve of watering stock,
but I considered it square enough in this case, for it was just a gift,
anyway. Of course, you can water a gift as much as you want to; and I
generally do. The old gold and silver coins of the country were of
ancient and unknown origin, as a rule, but some of them were Roman; they
were ill-shapen, and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the
full; they were hammered, not minted, and they were so worn with use
that the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters, and looked
like them. I judged that a sharp, bright new nickel, with a first-rate
likeness of the king on one side of it and Guenever on the other, and a
blooming pious motto, would take the tuck out of scrofula as handy as a
nobler coin and please the scrofulous fancy more; and I was right. This
batch was the first it was tried on, and it worked to a charm. The
saving in expense was a notable economy. You will see that by these
figures: We touched a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients; at former
rates, this would have cost the government about 40; at the new rate we
pulled through for about 5, thus saving upward of 00 at one swoop. To
appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke, consider these other
figures: the annual expenses of a national government amount to the
equivalent of a contribution of three days’ average wages of every
individual of the population, counting every individual as if he were a
man. If you take a nation of 60,000,000, where average wages are per
day, three days’ wages taken from each individual will provide
60,000,000 and pay the government’s expenses. In my day, in my own
country, this money was collected from imposts, and the citizen imagined
that the foreign importer paid it, and it made him comfortable to think
so; whereas, in fact, it was paid by the American people, and was so
equally and exactly distributed among them that the annual cost to the
100-millionaire and the annual cost to the sucking child of the
day-laborer was precisely the same–each paid . Nothing could be equaler
than that, I reckon. Well, Scotland and Ireland were tributary to
Arthur, and the united populations of the British Islands amounted to
something less than 1,000,000. A mechanic’s average wage was 3 cents a
day, when he paid his own keep. By this rule the national government’s
expenses were 0,000 a year, or about 50 a day. Thus, by the substitution
of nickels for gold on a king’s-evil day, I not only injured no one,
dissatisfied no one, but pleased all concerned and saved four-fifths of
that day’s national expense into the bargain–a saving which would have
been the equivalent of 00,000 in my day in America. In making this
substitution I had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source–the
wisdom of my boyhood–for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom,
howsoever lowly may be its origin: in my boyhood I had always saved my
pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary cause. The
buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as the coin, the coin
would answer me better than the buttons; all hands were happy and nobody
hurt.</p>
<p>Marinel took the patients as they came. He examined the candidate; if
he couldn’t qualify he was warned off; if he could he was passed along
to the king. A priest pronounced the words, “They shall lay their hands
on the sick, and they shall recover.“ Then the king stroked the ulcers,
while the reading continued; finally, the patient graduated and got his
nickel–the king hanging it around his neck himself–and was dismissed.
Would you think that that would cure? It certainly did. Any mummery will
cure if the patient’s faith is strong in it. Up by Astolat there was a
chapel where the Virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd
geese around there–the girl said so herself–and they built the chapel
upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the occurrence–a
picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick person to
approach; whereas, on the contrary, thousands of the lame and the sick
came and prayed before it every year and went away whole and sound; and
even the well could look upon it and live. Of course, when I was told
these things I did not believe them; but when I went there and saw them
I had to succumb. I saw the cures effected myself; and they were real
cures and not questionable. I saw cripples whom I had seen around
Camelot for years on crutches, arrive and pray before that picture, and
put down their crutches and walk off without a limp. There were piles of
crutches there which had been left by such people as a testimony.</p>
<p>In other places people operated on a patient’s mind, without saying a
word to him, and cured him. In others, experts assembled patients in a
room and prayed over them, and appealed to their faith, and those
patients went away cured. Wherever you find a king who can’t cure the
king’s-evil you can be sure that the most valuable superstition that
supports his throne–the subject’s belief in the divine appointment of
his sovereign–has passed away. In my youth the monarchs of England had
ceased to touch for the evil, but there was no occasion for this
diffidence: they could have cured it forty-nine times in fifty.</p>
<p>Well, when the priest had been droning for three hours, and the good
king polishing the evidences, and the sick were still pressing forward
as plenty as ever, I got to feeling intolerably bored. I was sitting by
an open window not far from the canopy of state. For the five hundredth
time a patient stood forward to have his repulsivenesses stroked; again
those words were being droned out: “they shall lay their hands on the
sick“–when outside there rang clear as a clarion a note that enchanted
my soul and tumbled thirteen worthless centuries about my ears: “Camelot
<em>Weekly Hosannah and Literary Volcano!</em>–latest irruption–only two
cents –all about the big miracle in the Valley of Holiness!“ One greater
than kings had arrived–the newsboy. But I was the only person in all
that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth, and what this
imperial magician was come into the world to do.</p>
<p>I dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper; the
Adam-newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change; is
around the corner yet. It was delicious to see a newspaper again, yet I
was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon the first batch of
display head-lines. I had lived in a clammy atmosphere of reverence,
respect, deference, so long that they sent a quivery little cold wave
through me:</p>
<p>HIGH TIMES IN THE VALLEY</p>
<p>OF HOLINESS!</p>
<hr />
<p>THE WATER-WORKS CORKED!</p>
<hr />
<p>BRER MERLIN WORKS HIS ARTS, BUT GETS LEFT?</p>
<hr />
<p>But the Boss scores on his first Innings!</p>
<hr />
<p>The Miraculous Well Uncorked amid awful outbursts of</p>
<p>INFERNAL FIRE AND SMOKE ATHUNDER!</p>
<hr />
<p>THE BUZZARD-ROOST ASTONISHED!</p>
<hr />
<p>UNPARALLELED REJOIBINGS!</p>
<p>–and so on, and so on. Yes, it was too loud. Once I could have
enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it, but now its note
was discordant. It was good Arkansas journalism, but this was not
Arkansas. Moreover, the next to the last line was calculated to give
offense to the hermits, and perhaps lose us their advertising. Indeed,
there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through the paper. It
was plain I had undergone a considerable change without noticing it. I
found myself unpleasantly affected by pert little irreverencies which
would have seemed but proper and airy graces of speech at an earlier
period of my life. There was an abundance of the following breed of
items, and they discomforted me:</p>
<p>LOCAL SMOKE AND CINDERS.</p>
<p>Sir Launcelot met up with old King Agrivance of Ireland unexpectedly
last weok over on the moor south of Sir Balmoral le Merveilleuse’s hog
dasture. The widow has been notified.</p>
<p>Expedition No. 3 will start adout the first of mext month on a search
f8r Sir Sagramour le Desirous. It is in com- and of the renowned Knight
of the Red Lawns, assissted by Sir Persant of Inde, who is compete9t.
intelligent, courte- ous, and in every way a brick, and fur- tHer
assisted by Sir Palamides the Sara- cen, who is no huckleberry hinself.
This is no pic-nic, these boys mean busineandandandands.</p>
<p>The readers of the Hosannah will re- gret to learn that the hadndsome
and popular Sir Charolais of Gaul, who dur- ing his four weeks’ stay at
the Bull and Halibut, this city, has won every heart by his polished
manners and elegant cPnversation, will pUll out to-day for home. Give us
another call, Charley!</p>
<p>The bdsiness end of the funeral of the late Sir Dalliance the duke’s
son of Cornwall, killed in an encounter with the Giant of the Knotted
Bludgeon last Tuesday on the borders of the Plain of Enchantment was in
the hands of the ever affable and efficient Mumble, prince of
un3ertakers, then whom there exists none by whom it were a more
satisfying pleasure to have the last sad offices performed. Give him a
trial.</p>
<p>The cordial thanks of the Hosannah office are due, from editor down
to devil, to the ever courteous and thought- ful Lord High Stew d of the
Palace’s Third Assistant V t for several sau- ceTs of ice crEam a
quality calculated to make the ey of the recipients hu- mid with grt
ude; and it done it. When this administration wants to chalk up a
desirable name for early promotion, the Hosannah would like a chance to
sudgest.</p>
<p>The Demoiselle Irene Dewlap, of South Astolat, is visiting her uncle,
the popular host of the Cattlemen’s Board- ing Hoandandandandse, Liver
Lane, this city.</p>
<p>Young Barker the bellows-mender is hoMe again, and looks much
improved by his vacation round-up among the out- lying smithies. See his
ad.</p>
<p>Of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning; I knew that
quite well, and yet it was somehow disappointing. The “Court Circular“
pleased me better; indeed, its simple and dignified respectfulness was a
distinct refreshment to me after all those disgraceful familiarities.
But even it could have been improved. Do what one may, there is no
getting an air of variety into a court circular, I acknowledge that.
There is a profound monotonousness about its facts that baffles and
defeats one’s sincerest efforts to make them sparkle and enthuse. The
best way to manage–in fact, the only sensible way–is to disguise
repetitiousness of fact under variety of form: skin your fact each time
and lay on a new cuticle of words. It deceives the eye; you think it is
a new fact; it gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like
everything; this excites you, and you drain the whole column, with a
good appetite, and perhaps never notice that it’s a barrel of soup made
out of a single bean. Clarence’s way was good, it was simple, it was
dignified, it was direct and business-like; all I say is, it was not the
best way:</p>
<p>COURT CIRCULAR.</p>
<p>On Monday, the king rode in the park. “ Tuesday, “ “ “ “ Wendesday “
“ “ “ Thursday “ “ “ “ Friday, “ “ “ “ Saturday “ “ “ “ Sunday, “ “
“</p>
<p>However, take the paper by and large, I was vastly pleased with it.
Little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and there,
but there were not enough of them to amount to anything, and it was good
enough Arkansas proof-reading, anyhow, and better than was needed in
Arthur’s day and realm. As a rule, the grammar was leaky and the
construction more or less lame; but I did not much mind these things.
They are common defects of my own, and one mustn’t criticise other
people on grounds where he can’t stand perpendicular himself.</p>
<p>I was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole
paper at this one meal, but I got only a few bites, and then had to
postpone, because the monks around me besieged me so with eager
questions: What is this curious thing? What is it for? Is it a
handkerchief?–saddle blanket?–part of a shirt? What is it made of? How
thin it is, and how dainty and frail; and how it rattles. Will it wear,
do you think, and won’t the rain injure it? Is it writing that appears
on it, or is it only ornamentation? They suspected it was writing,
because those among them who knew how to read Latin and had a smattering
of Greek, recognized some of the letters, but they could make nothing
out of the result as a whole. I put my information in the simplest form
I could:</p>
<p>“It is a public journal; I will explain what that is, another time.
It is not cloth, it is made of paper; some time I will explain what
paper is. The lines on it are reading matter; and not written by hand,
but printed; by and by I will explain what printing is. A thousand of
these sheets have been made, all exactly like this, in every minute
detail–they can’t be told apart.“ Then they all broke out with
exclamations of surprise and admiration:</p>
<p>“A thousand! Verily a mighty work–a year’s work for many men.“</p>
<p>“No–merely a day’s work for a man and a boy.“</p>
<p>They crossed themselves, and whiffed out a protective prayer or
two.</p>
<p>“Ah-h–a miracle, a wonder! Dark work of enchantment.“</p>
<p>I let it go at that. Then I read in a low voice, to as many as could
crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance, part of the account of
the miracle of the restoration of the well, and was accompanied by
astonished and reverent ejaculations all through: “Ah-h-h!“ “How true!“
“Amazing, amazing!“ “These be the very haps as they happened, in
marvelous exactness!“ And might they take this strange thing in their
hands, and feel of it and examine it?–they would be very careful. Yes.
So they took it, handling it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had
been some holy thing come from some supernatural region; and gently felt
of its texture, caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering
touch, and scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes. These
grouped bent heads, these charmed faces, these speaking eyes –how
beautiful to me! For was not this my darling, and was not all this mute
wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent tribute and unforced
compliment to it? I knew, then, how a mother feels when women, whether
strangers or friends, take her new baby, and close themselves about it
with one eager impulse, and bend their heads over it in a tranced
adoration that makes all the rest of the universe vanish out of their
consciousness and be as if it were not, for that time. I knew how she
feels, and that there is no other satisfied ambition, whether of king,
conqueror, or poet, that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit
or yields half so divine a contentment.</p>
<p>During all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to
group all up and down and about that huge hall, and my happy eye was
upon it always, and I sat motionless, steeped in satisfaction, drunk
with enjoyment. Yes, this was heaven; I was tasting it once, if I might
never taste it more.</p>
