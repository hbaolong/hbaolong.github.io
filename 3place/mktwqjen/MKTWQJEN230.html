<h4 id="the-petrified-man">THE PETRIFIED MAN</h4>
<p>Now, to show how really hard it is to foist a moral or a truth upon
an unsuspecting public through a burlesque without entirely and absurdly
missing one’s mark, I will here set down two experiences of my own in
this thing. In the fall of 1862, in Nevada and California, the people
got to running wild about extraordinary petrifactions and other natural
marvels. One could scarcely pick up a paper without finding in it one or
two glorified discoveries of this kind. The mania was becoming a little
ridiculous. I was a brand-new local editor in Virginia City, and I felt
called upon to destroy this growing evil; we all have our benignant,
fatherly moods at one time or another, I suppose. I chose to kill the
petrifaction mania with a delicate, a very delicate satire. But maybe it
was altogether too delicate, for nobody ever perceived the satire part
of it at all. I put my scheme in the shape of the discovery of a
remarkably petrified man.</p>
<p>I had had a temporary falling out with Mr.—-, the new coroner and
justice of the peace of Humboldt, and thought I might as well touch him
up a little at the same time and make him ridiculous, and thus combine
pleasure with business. So I told, in patient, belief-compelling detail,
all about the finding of a petrified-man at Gravelly Ford (exactly a
hundred and twenty miles, over a breakneck mountain trail from where —-
lived); how all the savants of the immediate neighborhood had been to
examine it (it was notorious that there was not a living creature within
fifty miles of there, except a few starving Indians; some crippled
grasshoppers, and four or five buzzards out of meat and too feeble to
get away); how those savants all pronounced the petrified man to have
been in a state of complete petrifaction for over ten generations; and
then, with a seriousness that I ought to have been ashamed to assume, I
stated that as soon as Mr.—-heard the news he summoned a jury, mounted
his mule, and posted off, with noble reverence for official duty, on
that awful five days’ journey, through alkali, sage brush, peril of
body, and imminent starvation, to hold an inquest on this man that had
been dead and turned to everlasting stone for more than three hundred
years! And then, my hand being “in,“ so to speak, I went on, with the
same unflinching gravity, to state that the jury returned a verdict that
deceased came to his death from protracted exposure. This only moved me
to higher flights of imagination, and I said that the jury, with that
charity so characteristic of pioneers, then dug a grave, and were about
to give the petrified man Christian burial, when they found that for
ages a limestone sediment had been trickling down the face of the stone
against which he was sitting, and this stuff had run under him and
cemented him fast to the “bed-rock“; that the jury (they were all
silver-miners) canvassed the difficulty a moment, and then got out their
powder and fuse, and proceeded to drill a hole under him, in order to
blast him from his position, when Mr.—-, “with that delicacy so
characteristic of him, forbade them, observing that it would be little
less than sacrilege to do such a thing.“</p>
<p>From beginning to end the “Petrified Man“ squib was a string of
roaring absurdities, albeit they were told with an unfair pretense of
truth that even imposed upon me to some extent, and I was in some danger
of believing in my own fraud. But I really had no desire to deceive
anybody, and no expectation of doing it. I depended on the way the
petrified man was sitting to explain to the public that he was a
swindle. Yet I purposely mixed that up with other things, hoping to make
it obscure–and I did. I would describe the position of one foot, and
then say his right thumb was against the side of his nose; then talk
about his other foot, and presently come back and say the fingers of his
right hand were spread apart; then talk about the back of his head a
little, and return and say the left thumb was hooked into the right
little finger; then ramble off about something else, and by and by drift
back again and remark that the fingers of the left hand were spread like
those of the right. But I was too ingenious. I mixed it up rather too
much; and so all that description of the attitude, as a key to the
humbuggery of the article, was entirely lost, for nobody but me ever
discovered and comprehended the peculiar and suggestive position of the
petrified man’s hands.</p>
<p>As a satire on the petrifaction mania, or anything else, my petrified
Man was a disheartening failure; for everybody received him in innocent
good faith, and I was stunned to see the creature I had begotten to pull
down the wonder-business with, and bring derision upon it, calmly
exalted to the grand chief place in the list of the genuine marvels our
Nevada had produced. I was so disappointed at the curious miscarriage of
my scheme, that at first I was angry, and did not like to think about
it; but by and by, when the exchanges began to come in with the
Petrified Man copied and guilelessly glorified, I began to feel a
soothing secret satisfaction; and as my gentleman’s field of travels
broadened, and by the exchanges I saw that he steadily and implacably
penetrated territory after territory, state after state, and land after
land, till he swept the great globe and culminated in sublime and
unimpeached legitimacy in the august London Lancet, my cup was full, and
I said I was glad I had done it. I think that for about eleven months,
as nearly as I can remember, Mr.—-’s daily mail-bag continued to be
swollen by the addition of half a bushel of newspapers hailing from many
climes with the Petrified Man in them, marked around with a prominent
belt of ink. I sent them to him. I did it for spite, not for fun.</p>
<p>He used to shovel them into his back yard and curse. And every day
during all those months the miners, his constituents (for miners never
quit joking a person when they get started), would call on him and ask
if he could tell them where they could get hold of a paper with the
Petrified Man in it. He could have accommodated a continent with them. I
hated—–in those days, and these things pacified me and pleased me. I
could not have gotten more real comfort out of him without killing
him.</p>
