<h4 id="our-last-hopes-of-rescue-fail">19 Our Last Hopes of Rescue
Fail</h4>
<p>JOAN HAD been adjudged guilty of heresy, sorcery, and all the other
terrible crimes set forth in the Twelve Articles, and her life was in
Cauchon’s hands at last. He could send her to the stake at once. His
work was finished now, you think? He was satisfied? Not at all. What
would his Archbishopric be worth if the people should get the idea into
their heads that this faction of interested priests, slaving under the
English lash, had wrongly condemned and burned Joan of Arc, Deliverer of
France? That would be to make of her a holy martyr. Then her spirit
would rise from her body’s ashes, a thousandfold reinforced, and sweep
the English domination into the sea, and Cauchon along with it. No, the
victory was not complete yet. Joan’s guilt must be established by
evidence which would satisfy the people. Where was that evidence to be
found? There was only one person in the world who could furnish it–Joan
of Arc herself. She must condemn herself, and in public–at least she
must seem to do it.</p>
<p>But how was this to be managed? Weeks had been spent already in
trying to get her to surrender–time wholly wasted; what was to persuade
her now? Torture had been threatened, the fire had been threatened; what
was left? Illness, deadly fatigue, and the sight of the fire, the
presence of the fire! That was left.</p>
<p>Now that was a shrewd thought. She was but a girl after all, and,
under illness and exhaustion, subject to a girl’s weaknesses.</p>
<p>Yes, it was shrewdly thought. She had tacitly said herself that under
the bitter pains of the rack they would be able to extort a false
confession from her. It was a hint worth remembering, and it was
remembered.</p>
<p>She had furnished another hint at the same time: that as soon as the
pains were gone, she would retract the confession. That hint was also
remembered.</p>
<p>She had herself taught them what to do, you see. First, they must
wear out her strength, then frighten her with the fire. Second, while
the fright was on her, she must be made to sign a paper.</p>
<p>But she would demand a reading of the paper. They could not venture
to refuse this, with the public there to hear. Suppose that during the
reading her courage should return?–she would refuse to sign then. Very
well, even that difficulty could be got over. They could read a short
paper of no importance, then slip a long and deadly one into its place
and trick her into signing that.</p>
<p>Yet there was still one other difficulty. If they made her seem to
abjure, that would free her from the death-penalty. They could keep her
in a prison of the Church, but they could not kill her.</p>
<p>That would not answer; for only her death would content the English.
Alive she was a terror, in a prison or out of it. She had escaped from
two prisons already.</p>
<p>But even that difficulty could be managed. Cauchon would make
promises to her; in return she would promise to leave off the male
dress. He would violate his promises, and that would so situate her that
she would not be able to keep hers. Her lapse would condemn her to the
stake, and the stake would be ready.</p>
<p>These were the several moves; there was nothing to do but to make
them, each in its order, and the game was won. One might almost name the
day that the betrayed girl, the most innocent creature in France and the
noblest, would go to her pitiful death.</p>
<p>The world knows now that Cauchon’s plan was as I have sketched it to
you, but the world did not know it at that time. There are sufficient
indications that Warwick and all the other English chiefs except the
highest one–the Cardinal of Winchester–were not let into the secret,
also, that only Loyseleur and Beaupere, on the French side, knew the
scheme. Sometimes I have doubted if even Loyseleur and Beaupere knew the
whole of it at first. However, if any did, it was these two.</p>
<p>It is usual to let the condemned pass their last night of life in
peace, but this grace was denied to poor Joan, if one may credit the
rumors of the time. Loyseleur was smuggled into her presence, and in the
character of priest, friend, and secret partisan of France and hater of
England, he spent some hours in beseeching her to do “the only right an
righteous thing“–submit to the Church, as a good Christian should; and
that then she would straightway get out of the clutches of the dreaded
English and be transferred to the Church’s prison, where she would be
honorably used and have women about her for jailers. He knew where to
touch her. He knew how odious to her was the presence of her rough and
profane English guards; he knew that her Voices had vaguely promised
something which she interpreted to be escape, rescue, release of some
sort, and the chance to burst upon France once more and victoriously
complete the great work which she had been commissioned of Heaven to do.
Also there was that other thing: if her failing body could be further
weakened by loss of rest and sleep now, her tired mind would be dazed
and drowsy on the morrow, and in ill condition to stand out against
persuasions, threats, and the sight of the stake, and also be purblind
to traps and snares which it would be swift to detect when in its normal
estate.</p>
<p>I do not need to tell you that there was no rest for me that night.
Nor for Noel. We went to the main gate of the city before nightfall,
with a hope in our minds, based upon that vague prophecy of Joan’s
Voices which seemed to promise a rescue by force at the last moment. The
immense news had flown swiftly far and wide that at last Joan of Arc was
condemned, and would be sentenced and burned alive on the morrow; and so
crowds of people were flowing in at the gate, and other crowds were
being refused admission by the soldiery; these being people who brought
doubtful passes or none at all. We scanned these crowds eagerly, but
thee was nothing about them to indicate that they were our old
war-comrades in disguise, and certainly there were no familiar faces
among them. And so, when the gate was closed at last, we turned away
grieved, and more disappointed than we cared to admit, either in speech
or thought.</p>
<p>The streets were surging tides of excited men. It was difficult to
make one’s way. Toward midnight our aimless tramp brought us to the
neighborhood of the beautiful church of St. Ouen, and there all was
bustle and work. The square was a wilderness of torches and people; and
through a guarded passage dividing the pack, laborers were carrying
planks and timbers and disappearing with them through the gate of the
churchyard. We asked what was going forward; the answer was:</p>
<p>“Scaffolds and the stake. Don’t you know that the French witch is to
be burned in the morning?“</p>
<p>Then we went away. We had no heart for that place.</p>
<p>At dawn we were at the city gate again; this time with a hope which
our wearied bodies and fevered minds magnified into a large probability.
We had heard a report that the Abbot of Jumieges with all his monks was
coming to witness the burning. Our desire, abetted by our imagination,
turned those nine hundred monks into Joan’s old campaigners, and their
Abbot into La Hire or the Bastard or D’Alencon; and we watched them file
in, unchallenged, the multitude respectfully dividing and uncovering
while they passed, with our hearts in our throats and our eyes swimming
with tears of joy and pride and exultation; and we tried to catch
glimpses of the faces under the cowls, and were prepared to give signal
to any recognized face that we were Joan’s men and ready and eager to
kill and be killed in the good cause. How foolish we were!</p>
<p>But we were young, you know, and youth hopeth all things, believeth
all things.</p>
