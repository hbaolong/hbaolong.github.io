1867-68. WASHINGTON AND SAN FRANCISCO. THE PROPOSED BOOK OF TRAVEL. A
NEW LECTURE</h4>
<p>From Mark Twain’s home letters we get several important side-lights
on this first famous book. We learn, for in stance, that it was he who
drafted the ship address to the Emperor–the opening lines of which
became so wearisome when repeated by the sailors. Furthermore, we learn
something of the scope and extent of his newspaper correspondence, which
must have kept him furiously busy, done as it was in the midst of
super-heated and continuous sight-seeing. He wrote fifty three letters
to the Alta-California, six to the New York Tribune, and at least two to
the New York Herald more than sixty, all told, of an average, length of
three to four thousand words each. Mark Twain always claimed to be a
lazy man, and certainly he was likely to avoid an undertaking not suited
to his gifts, but he had energy in abundance for work in his chosen
field. To have piled up a correspondence of that size in the time, and
under the circumstances already noted, quality considered, may be
counted a record in the history of travel letters.</p>
<p>They made him famous. Arriving in New York, November 19, 1867, Mark
Twain found himself no longer unknown to the metropolis, or to any
portion of America. Papers East and West had copied his Alta and Tribune
letters and carried his name into every corner of the States and
Territories. He had preached a new gospel in travel literature, the
gospel of frankness and sincerity that Americans could understand. Also
his literary powers had awakened at last. His work was no longer
trivial, crude, and showy; it was full of dignity, beauty, and power;
his humor was finer, worthier. The difference in quality between the
Quaker City letters and those written from the Sandwich Islands only a
year before can scarcely be measured.</p>
<p>He did not remain in New York, but went down to Washington, where he
had arranged for a private secretaryship with Senator William M.
Stewart,–[The “Bill“ Stewart mentioned in the preceding chapter.] whom
he had known in Nevada. Such a position he believed would make but
little demand upon his time, and would afford him an insight into
Washington life, which he could make valuable in the shape of newspaper
correspondence.</p>
<p>But fate had other plans for him. He presently received the following
letter:</p>
<p>From Elisha Bliss, Jr., in Hartford OFFICE OF THE AMERICAN PUBLISHING
COMPANY.</p>
<p>HARTFORD, CONN, Nov 21, 1867. SAMUEL L. CLEMENS Esq. Tribune Office,
New York.</p>
<p>DR. SIR,–We take the liberty to address you this, in place of a
letter which we had recently written and was about to forward to you,
not knowing your arrival home was expected so soon. We are desirous of
obtaining from you a work of some kind, perhaps compiled from your
letters from the East, andandandandc., with such interesting additions
as may be proper. We are the publishers of A. D. Richardson’s works, and
flatter ourselves that we can give an author as favorable terms and do
as full justice to his productions as any other house in the country. We
are perhaps the oldest subscription house in the country, and have never
failed to give a book an immense circulation. We sold about 100,000
copies of Richardson’s F. D. andandandand E. (Field, Dungeon and Escape)
and are now printing 41,000, of “Beyond the Mississippi,“ and large
orders ahead. If you have any thought of writing a book, or could be
induced to do so, we should be pleased to see you; and will do so. Will
you do us the favor to reply at once, at your earliest convenience. Very
truly, andandandandc., E. BLISS, Jr. Secty.</p>
<p>Clemens had already the idea of a book in mind and welcomed this
proposition.</p>
<p>To Elisha Bliss, Jr., in Hartford:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 2, 1867. E. BLISS, Jr. Esq. Sec’y American
Publishing Co.–</p>
<p>DEAR SIR,–I only received your favor of Nov. 21st last night, at the
rooms of the Tribune Bureau here. It was forwarded from the Tribune
office, New York, where it had lain eight or ten days. This will be a
sufficient apology for the seeming discourtesy of my silence.</p>
<p>I wrote fifty-two (three) letters for the San Francisco “Alta
California“ during the Quaker City excursion, about half of which number
have been printed, thus far. The “Alta“ has few exchanges in the East,
and I suppose scarcely any of these letters have been copied on this
side of the Rocky Mountains. I could weed them of their chief faults of
construction and inelegancies of expression and make a volume that would
be more acceptable in many respects than any I could now write. When
those letters were written my impressions were fresh, but now they have
lost that freshness; they were warm then–they are cold, now. I could
strike out certain letters, and write new ones wherewith to supply their
places. If you think such a book would suit your purpose, please drop me
a line, specifying the size and general style of the volume; when the
matter ought to be ready; whether it should have pictures in it or not;
and particularly what your terms with me would be, and what amount of
money I might possibly make out of it. The latter clause has a degree of
importance for me which is almost beyond my own comprehension. But you
understand that, of course.</p>
<p>I have other propositions for a book, but have doubted the propriety
of interfering with good newspaper engagements, except my way as an
author could be demonstrated to be plain before me. But I know
Richardson, and learned from him some months ago, something of an idea
of the subscription plan of publishing. If that is your plan invariably,
it looks safe.</p>
<p>I am on the N. Y. Tribune staff here as an “occasional,“, among other
things, and a note from you addressed to Very truly andandandandc. SAM
L. CLEMENS,</p>
<p>New York Tribune Bureau, Washington, will find me, without fail.</p>
<p>The exchange of these two letters marked the beginning of one of the
most notable publishing connections in American literary history. The
book, however, was not begun immediately. Bliss was in poor health and
final arrangements were delayed; it was not until late in January that
Clemens went to Hartford and concluded the arrangement.</p>
<p>Meantime, fate had disclosed another matter of even greater
importance; we get the first hint of it in the following letter, though
to him its beginning had been earlier–on a day in the blue harbor of
Smyrna, when young Charles Langdon, a fellow-passenger on the Quaker
City, had shown to Mark Twain a miniature of young Langdon’s sister at
home:</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>224 F. STREET, WASH, Jan. 8, 1868. MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–And so
the old Major has been there, has he? I would like mighty well to see
him. I was a sort of benefactor to him once. I helped to snatch him out
when he was about to ride into a Mohammedan Mosque in that queer old
Moorish town of Tangier, in Africa. If he had got in, the Moors would
have knocked his venerable old head off, for his temerity.</p>
<p>I have just arrived from New York-been there ever since Christmas
staying at the house of Dan Slote my Quaker City room-mate, and having a
splendid time. Charley Langdon, Jack Van Nostrand, Dan and I, (all
Quaker City night-hawks,) had a blow-out at Dan’s’ house and a lively
talk over old times. We went through the Holy Land together, and I just
laughed till my sides ached, at some of our reminiscences. It was the
unholiest gang that ever cavorted through Palestine, but those are the
best boys in the world. We needed Moulton badly. I started to make
calls, New Year’s Day, but I anchored for the day at the first house I
came to–Charlie Langdon’s sister was there (beautiful girl,) and Miss
Alice Hooker, another beautiful girl, a niece of Henry Ward Beecher’s.
We sent the old folks home early, with instructions not to send the
carriage till midnight, and then I just staid there and worried the life
out of those girls. I am going to spend a few days with the Langdon’s in
Elmira, New York, as soon as I get time, and a few days at Mrs. Hooker’s
in Hartford, Conn., shortly.</p>
<p>Henry Ward Beecher sent for me last Sunday to come over and dine (he
lives in Brooklyn, you know,) and I went. Harriet Beecher Stowe was
there, and Mrs. and Miss Beecher, Mrs. Hooker and my old Quaker City
favorite, Emma Beach.</p>
<p>We had a very gay time, if it was Sunday. I expect I told more lies
than I have told before in a month.</p>
<p>I went back by invitation, after the evening service, and finished
the blow-out, and then staid all night at Mr. Beach’s. Henry Ward is a
brick.</p>
<p>I found out at 10 o’clock, last night, that I was to lecture tomorrow
evening and so you must be aware that I have been working like sin all
night to get a lecture written. I have finished it, I call it “Frozen
Truth.“ It is a little top-heavy, though, because there is more truth in
the title than there is in the lecture.</p>
<p>But thunder, I mustn’t sit here writing all day, with so much
business before me.</p>
<p>Good by, and kind regards to all. Yrs affy SAM L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Jack Van Nostrand of this letter is “Jack“ of the Innocents. Emma
Beach was the daughter of Moses S. Beach, of the ‘New York Sun.’ Later
she became the wife of the well-known painter, Abbot H. Thayer.</p>
<p>We do not hear of Miss Langdon again in the letters of that time, but
it was not because she was absent from his thoughts. He had first seen
her with her father and brother at the old St. Nicholas Hotel, on lower
Broadway, where, soon after the arrival of the Quaker City in New York,
he had been invited to dine. Long afterward he said: “It is forty years
ago; from that day to this she has never been out of my mind.“</p>
<p>From his next letter we learn of the lecture which apparently was
delivered in Washington.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>WASH. Jan. 9, 1868. MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–That infernal lecture
is over, thank Heaven! It came near being a villainous failure. It was
not advertised at all. The manager was taken sick yesterday, and the man
who was sent to tell me, never got to me till afternoon today. There was
the dickens to pay. It was too late to do anything–too late to stop the
lecture. I scared up a door-keeper, and was ready at the proper time,
and by pure good luck a tolerably good house assembled and I was saved!
I hardly knew what I was going to talk about, but it went off in
splendid style. I was to have preached again Saturday night, but I
won’t–I can’t get along without a manager.</p>
<p>I have been in New York ever since Christmas, you know, and now I
shall have to work like sin to catch up my correspondence.</p>
<p>And I have got to get up that book, too. Cut my letters out of the
Alta’s and send them to me in an envelop. Some, here, that are not
mailed yet, I shall have to copy, I suppose.</p>
<p>I have got a thousand things to do, and am not doing any of them. I
feel perfectly savage. Good bye Yrs aff SAM.</p>
<p>On the whole, matters were going well with him. His next letter is
full of his success–overflowing with the boyish radiance which he never
quite outgrew.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, CONN. Jan. 24-68. DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–This is a good
week for me. I stopped in the Herald office as I came through New York,
to see the boys on the staff, and young James Gordon Bennett asked me to
write twice a week, impersonally, for the Herald, and said if I would I
might have full swing, and (write) about anybody and everybody I wanted
to. I said I must have the very fullest possible swing, and he said “all
right.“ I said “It’s a contract–“ and that settled that matter.</p>
<p>I’ll make it a point to write one letter a week, any-how.</p>
<p>But the best thing that has happened was here. This great American
Publishing Company kept on trying to bargain with me for a book till I
thought I would cut the matter short by coming up for a talk. I met
Rev. Henry Ward Beecher in Brooklyn, and with his usual whole-souled way
of dropping his own work to give other people a lift when he gets a
chance, he said, “Now, here, you are one of the talented men of the
age–nobody is going to deny that—but in matters of business, I don’t
suppose you know more than enough to came in when it rains. I’ll tell
you what to do, and how to do it.“ And he did.</p>
<p>And I listened well, and then came up here and made a splendid
contract for a Quaker City book of 5 or 600 large pages, with
illustrations, the manuscript to be placed in the publishers’ hands by
the middle of July. My percentage is to be a fifth more than they have
ever paid any author, except Horace Greeley. Beecher will be surprised,
I guess, when he hears this.</p>
<p>But I had my mind made up to one thing–I wasn’t going to touch a book
unless there was money in it, and a good deal of it. I told them so. I
had the misfortune to “bust out“ one author of standing. They had his
manuscript, with the understanding that they would publish his book if
they could not get a book from me, (they only publish two books at a
time, and so my book and Richardson’s Life of Grant will fill the bill
for next fall and winter)–so that manuscript was sent back to its author
today.</p>
<p>These publishers get off the most tremendous editions of their books
you can imagine. I shall write to the Enterprise and Alta every week, as
usual, I guess, and to the Herald twice a week–occasionally to the
Tribune and the Magazines (I have a stupid article in the Galaxy, just
issued) but I am not going to write to this, that and the other paper
any more.</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune wants letters, but I hope and pray I have charged
them so much that they will not close the contract. I am gradually
getting out of debt, but these trips to New York do cost like sin. I
hope you have cut out and forwarded my printed letters to Washington
–please continue to do so as they arrive.</p>
<p>I have had a tip-top time, here, for a few days (guest of Mr. Jno.
Hooker’s family–Beecher’s relatives-in a general way of Mr. Bliss, also,
who is head of the publishing firm.) Puritans are mighty straight-laced
and they won’t let me smoke in the parlor, but the Almighty don’t make
any better people.</p>
<p>Love to all-good-bye. I shall be in New York 3 days–then go on to the
Capital. Yrs affly, especially Ma., Yr SAM.</p>
<p>I have to make a speech at the annual Herald dinner on the 6th of
May.</p>
<p>No formal contract for the book had been made when this letter was
written. A verbal agreement between Bliss and Clemens had been reached,
to be ratified by an exchange of letters in the near future. Bliss had
made two propositions, viz., ten thousand dollars, cash in hand, or a
5-per-cent. royalty on the selling price of the book. The cash sum
offered looked very large to Mark Twain, and he was sorely tempted to
accept it. He had faith, however, in the book, and in Bliss’s ability to
sell it. He agreed, therefore, to the royalty proposition; “The best
business judgment I ever displayed“ he often declared in after years.
Five per cent. royalty sounds rather small in these days of more liberal
contracts. But the American Publishing Company sold its books only by
subscription, and the agents’ commissions and delivery expenses ate
heavily into the profits. Clemens was probably correct in saying that
his percentage was larger than had been paid to any previous author
except Horace Greeley. The John Hooker mentioned was the husband of
Henry Ward Beecher’s sister, Isabel. It was easy to understand the
Beecher family’s robust appreciation of Mark Twain.</p>
<p>From the office of Dan Slote, his room-mate of the Quaker City –“Dan“
of the Innocents–Clemens wrote his letter that closed the agreement with
Bliss.</p>
<p>To Elisha Bliss, Jr., in Hartford:</p>
<p>Office of SLOTE andandandand WOODMAN, Blank Book Manufacturers, Nos.
119-121 William St. NEW YORK, January 27, 1868. Mr. E. Bliss, Jr. Sec’y
American Publishing Co. Hartford Conn.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR, Your favor of Jan. 25th is received, and in reply, I will
say that I accede to your several propositions, viz: That I furnish to
the American Publishing Company, through you, with MSS sufficient for a
volume of 500 to 600 pages, the subject to be the Quaker City, the
voyage, description of places, andandandandc., and also embodying the
substance of the letters written by me during that trip, said MSS to be
ready about the first of August, next, I to give all the usual and
necessary attention in preparing said MSS for the press, and in
preparation of illustrations, in correction of proofs–no use to be made
by me of the material for this work in any way which will conflict with
its interest –the book to be sold by the American Publishing Co., by
subscription –and for said MS and labor on my part said Company to pay
me a copyright of 5 percent, upon the subscription price of the book for
all copies sold.</p>
<p>As further proposed by you, this understanding, herein set forth
shall be considered a binding contract upon all parties concerned, all
minor details to be arranged between us hereafter. Very truly yours,
SAM. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>(Private and General.)</p>
<p>I was to have gone to Washington tonight, but have held over a day,
to attend a dinner given by a lot of newspaper Editors and literary
scalliwags, at the Westminster Hotel. Shall go down to-morrow, if I
survive the banquet. Yrs truly SAM. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Mark Twain, in Washington, was in line for political preferment: His
wide acquaintance on the Pacific slope, his new fame and growing
popularity, his powerful and dreaded pen, all gave him special
distinction at the capital. From time to time the offer of one office or
another tempted him, but he wisely, or luckily, resisted. In his letters
home are presented some of his problems.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>224 F. STREET WASHINGTON Feb. 6, 1868. MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–For
two months there have been some fifty applications before the government
for the postmastership of San Francisco, which is the heaviest
concentration of political power on the coast and consequently is a post
which is much coveted.,</p>
<p>When I found that a personal friend of mine, the Chief Editor of the
Alta was an applicant I said I didn’t want it–I would not take 0,000 a
year out of a friend’s pocket.</p>
<p>The two months have passed, I heard day before yesterday that a new
and almost unknown candidate had suddenly turned up on the inside track,
and was to be appointed at once. I didn’t like that, and went after his
case in a fine passion. I hunted up all our Senators and representatives
and found that his name was actually to come from the President early in
the morning.</p>
<p>Then Judge Field said if I wanted the place he could pledge me the
President’s appointment–and Senator Conness said he would guarantee me
the Senate’s confirmation. It was a great temptation, but it would
render it impossible to fill my book contract, and I had to drop the
idea.</p>
<p>I have to spend August and September in Hartford which isn’t San
Francisco. Mr. Conness offers me any choice out of five influential
California offices. Now, some day or other I shall want an office and
then, just my luck, I can’t get it, I suppose.</p>
<p>They want to send me abroad, as a Consul or a Minister. I said I
didn’t want any of the pie. God knows I am mean enough and lazy enough,
now, without being a foreign consul.</p>
<p>Sometime in the course of the present century I think they will
create a Commissioner of Patents, and then I hope to get a berth for
Orion.</p>
<p>I published 6 or 7 letters in the Tribune while I was gone, now I
cannot get them. I suppose I must have them copied. Love to all SAM.</p>
<p>Orion Clemens was once more a candidate for office: Nevada had become
a State; with regularly elected officials, and Orion had somehow missed
being chosen. His day of authority had passed, and the law having failed
to support him, he was again back at his old occupation, setting type in
St. Louis. He was, as ever, full of dreams and inventions that would
some day lead to fortune. With the gift of the Sellers imagination,
inherited by all the family, he lacked the driving power which means
achievement. More and more as the years went by he would lean upon his
brother for moral and physical support. The chances for him in
Washington do not appear to have been bright. The political situation
under Andrew Johnson was not a happy one.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>224 F. STREET, WASH., Feb. 21. (1868) MY DEAR BRO.,–I am glad you do
not want the clerkship, for that Patent Office is in such a muddle that
there would be no security for the permanency of a place in it. The same
remark will apply to all offices here, now, and no doubt will, till the
close of the present administration.</p>
<p>Any man who holds a place here, now, stands prepared at all times to
vacate it. You are doing, now, exactly what I wanted you to do a year
ago.</p>
<p>We chase phantoms half the days of our lives.</p>
<p>It is well if we learn wisdom even then, and save the other half.</p>
<p>I am in for it. I must go on chasing them until I marry–then I am
done with literature and all other bosh,–that is, literature wherewith
to please the general public.</p>
<p>I shall write to please myself, then. I hope you will set type till
you complete that invention, for surely government pap must be
nauseating food for a man–a man whom God has enabled to saw wood and be
independent. It really seemed to me a falling from grace, the idea of
going back to San Francisco nothing better than a mere postmaster,
albeit the public would have thought I came with gilded honors, and in
great glory.</p>
<p>I only retain correspondence enough, now, to make a living for
myself, and have discarded all else, so that I may have time to spare
for the book. Drat the thing, I wish it were done, or that I had no
other writing to do.</p>
<p>This is the place to get a poor opinion of everybody in. There isn’t
one man in Washington, in civil office, who has the brains of Anson
Burlingame–and I suppose if China had not seized and saved his great
talents to the world, this government would have discarded him when his
time was up.</p>
<p>There are more pitiful intellects in this Congress! Oh, geeminy!
There are few of them that I find pleasant enough company to visit.</p>
<p>I am most infernally tired of Wash. and its “attractions.“ To be busy
is a man’s only happiness–and I am–otherwise I should die Yrs. aff
SAM.</p>
<p>The secretarial position with Senator Stewart was short-lived. One
cannot imagine Mark Twain as anybody’s secretary, and doubtless there
was little to be gained on either side by the arrangement. They parted
without friction, though in later years, when Stewart had become old and
irascible, he used to recount a list of grievances and declare that he
had been obliged to threaten violence in order to bring Mark to terms;
but this was because the author of Roughing It had in that book taken
liberties with the Senator, to the extent of an anecdote and portrait
which, though certainly harmless enough, had for some reason given deep
offense.</p>
<p>Mark Twain really had no time for secretary work. For one thing he
was associated with John Swinton in supplying a Washington letter to a
list of newspapers, and then he was busy collecting his Quaker City
letters, and preparing the copy for his book. Matters were going well
enough, when trouble developed from an unexpected quarter. The
Alta-California had copyrighted the letters and proposed to issue them
in book form. There had been no contract which would prevent this, and
the correspondence which Clemens undertook with the Alta management led
to nothing. He knew that he had powerful friends among the owners, if he
could reach them personally, and he presently concluded to return to San
Francisco, make what arrangement he could, and finish his book there. It
was his fashion to be prompt; in his next letter we find him already on
the way.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>AT SEA, Sunday, March 15, Lat. 25. (1868) DEAR FOLKS,–I have nothing
to write, except that I am well–that the weather is fearfully hot-that
the Henry Chauncey is a magnificent ship –that we have twelve hundred,
passengers on board–that I have two staterooms, and so am not
crowded–that I have many pleasant friends here, and the people are not
so stupid as on the Quaker City–that we had Divine Service in the main
saloon at 10.30 this morning–that we expect to meet the upward bound
vessel in Latitude 23, and this is why I am writing now.</p>
<p>We shall reach Aspinwall Thursday morning at 6 o’clock, and San
Francisco less than two weeks later. I worry a great deal about being
obliged to go without seeing you all, but it could not be helped.</p>
<p>Dan Slote, my splendid room-mate in the Quaker City and the noblest
man on earth, will call to see you within a month. Make him dine with
you and spend the evening. His house is my home always in. New York. Yrs
affy, SAM.</p>
<p>The San Francisco trip proved successful. Once on the ground Clemens
had little difficulty in convincing the Alta publishers that they had
received full value in the newspaper use of the letters, and that the
book rights remained with the author. A letter to Bliss conveys the
situation.</p>
<p>To Elisha Bliss, Jr., in Hartford:</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, May 5, ’68.</p>
<p>E. BLISS, Jr. Esq.</p>
<p>Dr. SIR,–The Alta people, after some hesitation, have given me
permission to use my printed letters, and have ceased to think of
publishing them themselves in book form. I am steadily at work, and
shall start East with the completed Manuscript, about the middle of
June.</p>
<p>I lectured here, on the trip, the other night-over sixteen hundred
dollars in gold in the house–every seat taken and paid for before night.
Yrs truly, MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>But he did not sail in June. His friends persuaded him to cover his
lecture circuit of two years before, telling the story of his travels.
This he did with considerable profit, being everywhere received with
great honors. He ended this tour with a second lecture in San Francisco,
announced in a droll and characteristic fashion which delighted his
Pacific admirers, and insured him a crowded house.–[See Mark Twain: A
Biography, chap xlvi, and Appendix H.]</p>
<p>His agreement had been to deliver his MS. about August 1st. Returning
by the Chauncey, July 28th, he was two days later in Hartford, and had
placid the copy for the new book in Bliss’s hands. It was by no means a
compilation of his newspaper letters. His literary vision was steadily
broadening. All of the letters had been radically edited, some had been
rewritten, some entirely eliminated. He probably thought very well of
the book, an opinion shared by Bliss, but it is unlikely that either of
them realized that it was to become a permanent classic, and the best
selling book of travel for at least fifty years.</p>
