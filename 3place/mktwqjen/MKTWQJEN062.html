<h4 id="chapter-lxi.">CHAPTER LXI.</h4>
<p>In this place I will print an article which I wrote for the New York
Herald the night we arrived. I do it partly because my contract with my
publishers makes it compulsory; partly because it is a proper, tolerably
accurate, and exhaustive summing up of the cruise of the ship and the
performances of the pilgrims in foreign lands; and partly because some
of the passengers have abused me for writing it, and I wish the public
to see how thankless a task it is to put one’s self to trouble to
glorify unappreciative people. I was charged with “rushing into print“
with these compliments. I did not rush. I had written news letters to
the Herald sometimes, but yet when I visited the office that day I did
not say any thing about writing a valedictory. I did go to the Tribune
office to see if such an article was wanted, because I belonged on the
regular staff of that paper and it was simply a duty to do it. The
managing editor was absent, and so I thought no more about it. At night
when the Herald’s request came for an article, I did not “rush.“ In
fact, I demurred for a while, because I did not feel like writing
compliments then, and therefore was afraid to speak of the cruise lest I
might be betrayed into using other than complimentary language. However,
I reflected that it would be a just and righteous thing to go down and
write a kind word for the Hadjis–Hadjis are people who have made the
pilgrimage–because parties not interested could not do it so feelingly
as I, a fellow-Hadji, and so I penned the valedictory. I have read it,
and read it again; and if there is a sentence in it that is not
fulsomely complimentary to captain, ship and passengers, I can not find
it. If it is not a chapter that any company might be proud to have a
body write about them, my judgment is fit for nothing. With these
remarks I confidently submit it to the unprejudiced judgment of the
reader:</p>
<p>RETURN OF THE HOLY LAND EXCURSIONISTS–THE STORY OF THE CRUISE.</p>
<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD:</p>
<p>The steamer Quaker City has accomplished at last her extraordinary
voyage and returned to her old pier at the foot of Wall street. The
expedition was a success in some respects, in some it was not.
Originally it was advertised as a “pleasure excursion.“ Well, perhaps,
it was a pleasure excursion, but certainly it did not look like one;
certainly it did not act like one. Any body’s and every body’s notion of
a pleasure excursion is that the parties to it will of a necessity be
young and giddy and somewhat boisterous. They will dance a good deal,
sing a good deal, make love, but sermonize very little. Any body’s and
every body’s notion of a well conducted funeral is that there must be a
hearse and a corpse, and chief mourners and mourners by courtesy, many
old people, much solemnity, no levity, and a prayer and a sermon withal.
Three-fourths of the Quaker City’s passengers were between forty and
seventy years of age! There was a picnic crowd for you! It may be
supposed that the other fourth was composed of young girls. But it was
not. It was chiefly composed of rusty old bachelors and a child of six
years. Let us average the ages of the Quaker City’s pilgrims and set the
figure down as fifty years. Is any man insane enough to imagine that
this picnic of patriarchs sang, made love, danced, laughed, told
anecdotes, dealt in ungodly levity? In my experience they sinned little
in these matters. No doubt it was presumed here at home that these
frolicsome veterans laughed and sang and romped all day, and day after
day, and kept up a noisy excitement from one end of the ship to the
other; and that they played blind-man’s buff or danced quadrilles and
waltzes on moonlight evenings on the quarter-deck; and that at odd
moments of unoccupied time they jotted a laconic item or two in the
journals they opened on such an elaborate plan when they left home, and
then skurried off to their whist and euchre labors under the cabin
lamps. If these things were presumed, the presumption was at fault. The
venerable excursionists were not gay and frisky. They played no
blind-man’s buff; they dealt not in whist; they shirked not the irksome
journal, for alas! most of them were even writing books. They never
romped, they talked but little, they never sang, save in the nightly
prayer-meeting. The pleasure ship was a synagogue, and the pleasure trip
was a funeral excursion without a corpse. (There is nothing exhilarating
about a funeral excursion without a corpse.) A free, hearty laugh was a
sound that was not heard oftener than once in seven days about those
decks or in those cabins, and when it was heard it met with precious
little sympathy. The excursionists danced, on three separate evenings,
long, long ago, (it seems an age.) quadrilles, of a single set, made up
of three ladies and five gentlemen, (the latter with handkerchiefs
around their arms to signify their sex.) who timed their feet to the
solemn wheezing of a melodeon; but even this melancholy orgie was voted
to be sinful, and dancing was discontinued.</p>
<p>The pilgrims played dominoes when too much Josephus or Robinson’s
Holy Land Researches, or book-writing, made recreation necessary – for
dominoes is about as mild and sinless a game as any in the world,
perhaps, excepting always the ineffably insipid diversion they call
croquet, which is a game where you don’t pocket any balls and don’t
carom on any thing of any consequence, and when you are done nobody has
to pay, and there are no refreshments to saw off, and, consequently,
there isn’t any satisfaction whatever about it – they played dominoes
till they were rested, and then they blackguarded each other privately
till prayer-time. When they were not seasick they were uncommonly prompt
when the dinner-gong sounded. Such was our daily life on board the
ship–solemnity, decorum, dinner, dominoes, devotions, slander. It was
not lively enough for a pleasure trip; but if we had only had a corpse
it would have made a noble funeral excursion. It is all over now; but
when I look back, the idea of these venerable fossils skipping forth on
a six months’ picnic, seems exquisitely refreshing. The advertised title
of the expedition–“The Grand Holy Land Pleasure Excursion“ – was a
misnomer. “The Grand Holy Land Funeral Procession“ would have been
better–much better.</p>
<p>Wherever we went, in Europe, Asia, or Africa, we made a sensation,
and, I suppose I may add, created a famine. None of us had ever been any
where before; we all hailed from the interior; travel was a wild novelty
to us, and we conducted ourselves in accordance with the natural
instincts that were in us, and trammeled ourselves with no ceremonies,
no conventionalities. We always took care to make it understood that we
were Americans–Americans! When we found that a good many foreigners had
hardly ever heard of America, and that a good many more knew it only as
a barbarous province away off somewhere, that had lately been at war
with somebody, we pitied the ignorance of the Old World, but abated no
jot of our importance. Many and many a simple community in the Eastern
hemisphere will remember for years the incursion of the strange horde in
the year of our Lord 1867, that called themselves Americans, and seemed
to imagine in some unaccountable way that they had a right to be proud
of it. We generally created a famine, partly because the coffee on the
Quaker City was unendurable, and sometimes the more substantial fare was
not strictly first class; and partly because one naturally tires of
sitting long at the same board and eating from the same dishes.</p>
<p>The people of those foreign countries are very, very ignorant. They
looked curiously at the costumes we had brought from the wilds of
America. They observed that we talked loudly at table sometimes. They
noticed that we looked out for expenses, and got what we conveniently
could out of a franc, and wondered where in the mischief we came from.
In Paris they just simply opened their eyes and stared when we spoke to
them in French! We never did succeed in making those idiots understand
their own language. One of our passengers said to a shopkeeper, in
reference to a proposed return to buy a pair of gloves, “Allong restay
trankeel–may be ve coom Moonday;“ and would you believe it, that
shopkeeper, a born Frenchman, had to ask what it was that had been said.
Sometimes it seems to me, somehow, that there must be a difference
between Parisian French and Quaker City French.</p>
<p>The people stared at us every where, and we stared at them. We
generally made them feel rather small, too, before we got done with
them, because we bore down on them with America’s greatness until we
crushed them. And yet we took kindly to the manners and customs, and
especially to the fashions of the various people we visited. When we
left the Azores, we wore awful capotes and used fine tooth
combs–successfully. When we came back from Tangier, in Africa, we were
topped with fezzes of the bloodiest hue, hung with tassels like an
Indian’s scalp-lock. In France and Spain we attracted some attention in
these costumes. In Italy they naturally took us for distempered
Garibaldians, and set a gunboat to look for any thing significant in our
changes of uniform. We made Rome howl. We could have made any place howl
when we had all our clothes on. We got no fresh raiment in Greece–they
had but little there of any kind. But at Constantinople, how we turned
out! Turbans, scimetars, fezzes, horse-pistols, tunics, sashes, baggy
trowsers, yellow slippers–Oh, we were gorgeous! The illustrious dogs of
Constantinople barked their under jaws off, and even then failed to do
us justice. They are all dead by this time. They could not go through
such a run of business as we gave them and survive.</p>
<p>And then we went to see the Emperor of Russia. We just called on him
as comfortably as if we had known him a century or so, and when we had
finished our visit we variegated ourselves with selections from Russian
costumes and sailed away again more picturesque than ever. In Smyrna we
picked up camel’s hair shawls and other dressy things from Persia; but
in Palestine–ah, in Palestine–our splendid career ended. They didn’t
wear any clothes there to speak of. We were satisfied, and stopped. We
made no experiments. We did not try their costume. But we astonished the
natives of that country. We astonished them with such eccentricities of
dress as we could muster. We prowled through the Holy Land, from Cesarea
Philippi to Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, a weird procession of pilgrims,
gotten up regardless of expense, solemn, gorgeous, green-spectacled,
drowsing under blue umbrellas, and astride of a sorrier lot of horses,
camels and asses than those that came out of Noah’s ark, after eleven
months of seasickness and short rations. If ever those children of
Israel in Palestine forget when Gideon’s Band went through there from
America, they ought to be cursed once more and finished. It was the
rarest spectacle that ever astounded mortal eyes, perhaps.</p>
<p>Well, we were at home in Palestine. It was easy to see that that was
the grand feature of the expedition. We had cared nothing much about
Europe. We galloped through the Louvre, the Pitti, the Ufizzi, the
Vatican–all the galleries–and through the pictured and frescoed churches
of Venice, Naples, and the cathedrals of Spain; some of us said that
certain of the great works of the old masters were glorious creations of
genius, (we found it out in the guide-book, though we got hold of the
wrong picture sometimes,) and the others said they were disgraceful old
daubs. We examined modern and ancient statuary with a critical eye in
Florence, Rome, or any where we found it, and praised it if we saw fit,
and if we didn’t we said we preferred the wooden Indians in front of the
cigar stores of America. But the Holy Land brought out all our
enthusiasm. We fell into raptures by the barren shores of Galilee; we
pondered at Tabor and at Nazareth; we exploded into poetry over the
questionable loveliness of Esdraelon; we meditated at Jezreel and
Samaria over the missionary zeal of Jehu; we rioted–fairly rioted among
the holy places of Jerusalem; we bathed in Jordan and the Dead Sea,
reckless whether our accident-insurance policies were extra-hazardous or
not, and brought away so many jugs of precious water from both places
that all the country from Jericho to the mountains of Moab will suffer
from drouth this year, I think. Yet, the pilgrimage part of the
excursion was its pet feature–there is no question about that. After
dismal, smileless Palestine, beautiful Egypt had few charms for us. We
merely glanced at it and were ready for home.</p>
<p>They wouldn’t let us land at Malta–quarantine; they would not let us
land in Sardinia; nor at Algiers, Africa; nor at Malaga, Spain, nor
Cadiz, nor at the Madeira islands. So we got offended at all foreigners
and turned our backs upon them and came home. I suppose we only stopped
at the Bermudas because they were in the programme. We did not care any
thing about any place at all. We wanted to go home. Homesickness was
abroad in the ship–it was epidemic. If the authorities of New York had
known how badly we had it, they would have quarantined us here.</p>
<p>The grand pilgrimage is over. Good-bye to it, and a pleasant memory
to it, I am able to say in all kindness. I bear no malice, no ill-will
toward any individual that was connected with it, either as passenger or
officer. Things I did not like at all yesterday I like very well to-day,
now that I am at home, and always hereafter I shall be able to poke fun
at the whole gang if the spirit so moves me to do, without ever saying a
malicious word. The expedition accomplished all that its programme
promised that it should accomplish, and we ought all to be satisfied
with the management of the matter, certainly. Bye-bye!</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>I call that complimentary. It is complimentary; and yet I never have
received a word of thanks for it from the Hadjis; on the contrary I
speak nothing but the serious truth when I say that many of them even
took exceptions to the article. In endeavoring to please them I slaved
over that sketch for two hours, and had my labor for my pains. I never
will do a generous deed again.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION.</p>
<p>Nearly one year has flown since this notable pilgrimage was ended;
and as I sit here at home in San Francisco thinking, I am moved to
confess that day by day the mass of my memories of the excursion have
grown more and more pleasant as the disagreeable incidents of travel
which encumbered them flitted one by one out of my mind–and now, if the
Quaker City were weighing her anchor to sail away on the very same
cruise again, nothing could gratify me more than to be a passenger. With
the same captain and even the same pilgrims, the same sinners. I was on
excellent terms with eight or nine of the excursionists (they are my
staunch friends yet,) and was even on speaking terms with the rest of
the sixty-five. I have been at sea quite enough to know that that was a
very good average. Because a long sea-voyage not only brings out all the
mean traits one has, and exaggerates them, but raises up others which he
never suspected he possessed, and even creates new ones. A twelve
months’ voyage at sea would make of an ordinary man a very miracle of
meanness. On the other hand, if a man has good qualities, the spirit
seldom moves him to exhibit them on shipboard, at least with any sort of
emphasis. Now I am satisfied that our pilgrims are pleasant old people
on shore; I am also satisfied that at sea on a second voyage they would
be pleasanter, somewhat, than they were on our grand excursion, and so I
say without hesitation that I would be glad enough to sail with them
again. I could at least enjoy life with my handful of old friends. They
could enjoy life with their cliques as well–passengers invariably divide
up into cliques, on all ships.</p>
<p>And I will say, here, that I would rather travel with an excursion
party of Methuselahs than have to be changing ships and comrades
constantly, as people do who travel in the ordinary way. Those latter
are always grieving over some other ship they have known and lost, and
over other comrades whom diverging routes have separated from them. They
learn to love a ship just in time to change it for another, and they
become attached to a pleasant traveling companion only to lose him. They
have that most dismal experience of being in a strange vessel, among
strange people who care nothing about them, and of undergoing the
customary bullying by strange officers and the insolence of strange
servants, repeated over and over again within the compass of every
month. They have also that other misery of packing and unpacking
trunks–of running the distressing gauntlet of custom-houses–of the
anxieties attendant upon getting a mass of baggage from point to point
on land in safety. I had rasher sail with a whole brigade of patriarchs
than suffer so. We never packed our trunks but twice–when we sailed from
New York, and when we returned to it. Whenever we made a land journey,
we estimated how many days we should be gone and what amount of clothing
we should need, figured it down to a mathematical nicety, packed a
valise or two accordingly, and left the trunks on board. We chose our
comrades from among our old, tried friends, and started. We were never
dependent upon strangers for companionship. We often had occasion to
pity Americans whom we found traveling drearily among strangers with no
friends to exchange pains and pleasures with. Whenever we were coming
back from a land journey, our eyes sought one thing in the distance
first–the ship –and when we saw it riding at anchor with the flag apeak,
we felt as a returning wanderer feels when he sees his home. When we
stepped on board, our cares vanished, our troubles were at an end–for
the ship was home to us. We always had the same familiar old state-room
to go to, and feel safe and at peace and comfortable again.</p>
<p>I have no fault to find with the manner in which our excursion was
conducted. Its programme was faithfully carried out–a thing which
surprised me, for great enterprises usually promise vastly more than
they perform. It would be well if such an excursion could be gotten up
every year and the system regularly inaugurated. Travel is fatal to
prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it
sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and
things can not be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the
earth all one’s lifetime.</p>
<p>The Excursion is ended, and has passed to its place among the things
that were. But its varied scenes and its manifold incidents will linger
pleasantly in our memories for many a year to come. Always on the wing,
as we were, and merely pausing a moment to catch fitful glimpses of the
wonders of half a world, we could not hope to receive or retain vivid
impressions of all it was our fortune to see. Yet our holyday flight has
not been in vain–for above the confusion of vague recollections, certain
of its best prized pictures lift themselves and will still continue
perfect in tint and outline after their surroundings shall have faded
away.</p>
<p>We shall remember something of pleasant France; and something also of
Paris, though it flashed upon us a splendid meteor, and was gone again,
we hardly knew how or where. We shall remember, always, how we saw
majestic Gibraltar glorified with the rich coloring of a Spanish sunset
and swimming in a sea of rainbows. In fancy we shall see Milan again,
and her stately Cathedral with its marble wilderness of graceful spires.
And Padua–Verona–Como, jeweled with stars; and patrician Venice, afloat
on her stagnant flood–silent, desolate, haughty–scornful of her humbled
state–wrapping herself in memories of her lost fleets, of battle and
triumph, and all the pageantry of a glory that is departed.</p>
<p>We can not forget Florence–Naples–nor the foretaste of heaven that is
in the delicious atmosphere of Greece–and surely not Athens and the
broken temples of the Acropolis. Surely not venerable Rome–nor the green
plain that compasses her round about, contrasting its brightness with
her gray decay–nor the ruined arches that stand apart in the plain and
clothe their looped and windowed raggedness with vines. We shall
remember St. Peter’s: not as one sees it when he walks the streets of
Rome and fancies all her domes are just alike, but as he sees it leagues
away, when every meaner edifice has faded out of sight and that one dome
looms superbly up in the flush of sunset, full of dignity and grace,
strongly outlined as a mountain.</p>
<p>We shall remember Constantinople and the Bosporus–the colossal
magnificence of Baalbec–the Pyramids of Egypt–the prodigious form, the
benignant countenance of the Sphynx–Oriental Smyrna–sacred Jerusalem
–Damascus, the “Pearl of the East,“ the pride of Syria, the fabled
Garden of Eden, the home of princes and genii of the Arabian Nights, the
oldest metropolis on earth, the one city in all the world that has kept
its name and held its place and looked serenely on while the Kingdoms
and Empires of four thousand years have risen to life, enjoyed their
little season of pride and pomp, and then vanished and been
forgotten!</p>

<h2 id="a-burlesque-autobiography">A BURLESQUE AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>by Mark Twain</p>
<p>Contents: Mark Twain’s (Burlesque) Auto-Biography First Romance.</p>
<p>1871</p>
<p>BURLESQUE AUTOBIOGRAPHY.</p>
<p>Two or three persons having at different times intimated that if I
would write an autobiography they would read it, when they got leisure,
I yield at last to this frenzied public demand, and herewith tender my
history:</p>
<p>Ours is a noble old house, and stretches a long way back into
antiquity. The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a
friend of the family by the name of Higgins. This was in the eleventh
century, when our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork,
England. Why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal
name (except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an
alias to avert foolishness), instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none
of us has ever felt much desire to stir. It is a kind of vague, pretty
romance, and we leave it alone. All the old families do that way.</p>
<p>Arthour Twain was a man of considerable note a solicitor on the
highway in William Rufus’ time. At about the age of thirty he went to
one of those fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see
about something, and never returned again. While there he died
suddenly.</p>
<p>Augustus Twain, seems to have made something of a stir about the year
1160. He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his old
sabre and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night,
and stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump. He was a
born humorist. But he got to going too far with it; and the first time
he was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed one
end of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where it
could contemplate the people and have a good time. He never liked any
situation so much or stuck to it so long.</p>
<p>Then for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a
succession of soldiers–noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went
into battle singing; right behind the army, and always went out
a-whooping, right ahead of it.</p>
<p>This is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart’s poor witticism that
our family tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck
out at right angles, and bore fruit winter, and summer.</p>
<p>||=======|==== || | || | || O || / ||  || || || || || || || OUR
FAMILY TREE</p>
<p>Early in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called “the
Scholar.“ He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand. And he could imitate
anybody’s hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his
head off to see it. He had infinite sport with his talent. But by and by
he took a contract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the
work spoiled his hand. Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the
stone business, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two
years. In fact, he died in harness. During all those long years he gave
such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week
till government gave him another. He was a perfect pet. And he was
always a favorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member
of their benevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang. He always
wore his hair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died
lamented by the government. He was a sore loss to his country. For he
was so regular.</p>
<p>Some years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain. He came
over to this country with Columbus in 1492, as a passenger. He appears
to have been of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition. He complained of
the food all the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore
unless there was a change. He wanted fresh shad. Hardly a day passed
over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in
the air, sneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe
Columbus knew where he was going to or had ever been there before. The
memorable cry of “Land ho!“ thrilled every heart in the ship but his. He
gazed a while through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying
on the distant water, and then said: “Land be hanged,–it’s a raft!“</p>
<p>When this questionable passenger came on board the ship, he brought
nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked
“B. G.,“ one cotton sock marked “L. W. C.“ one woollen one marked “D.
F.“ and a night-shirt marked “O. M. R.“ And yet during the voyage he
worried more about his “trunk,“ and gave himself more airs about it,
than all the rest of the passengers put together.</p>
<p>If the ship was “down by the head,“ and would got steer, he would go
and move his “trunk“ farther aft, and then watch the effect. If the ship
was “by the stern,“ he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men to
“shift that baggage.“ In storms he had to be gagged, because his
wailings about his “trunk“ made it impossible for the men to hear the
orders. The man does not appear to have been openly charged with any
gravely unbecoming thing, but it is noted in the ship’s log as a
“curious circumstance“ that albeit he brought his baggage on board the
ship in a newspaper, he took it ashore in four trunks, a queensware
crate, and a couple of champagne baskets. But when he came back
insinuating in an insolent, swaggering way, that some of his things were
missing, and was going to search the other passengers’ baggage, it was
too much, and they threw him overboard. They watched long and
wonderingly for him to come up, but not even a bubble rose on the
quietly ebbing tide. But while every one was most absorbed in gazing
over the side, and the interest was momentarily increasing, it was
observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor
cable hanging limp from the bow. Then in the ship’s dimmed and ancient
log we find this quaint note:</p>
<p>“In time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde gonne
downe and got ye anchor, and toke ye same and solde it to ye dam
sauvages from ye interior, saying yt he hadde founde it, ye sonne of a
ghun!“</p>
<p>Yet this ancestor had good and noble instincts, and it is with pride
that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who
ever interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our
Indians. He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows, and to his
dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more
restraining and elevating influence on the Indians than any other
reformer that ever, labored among them. At this point the chronicle
becomes less frank and chatty, and closes abruptly by saying that the
old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever
hanged in America, and while there received injuries which terminated in
his death.</p>
<p>The great grandson of the “Reformer“ flourished in sixteen hundred
and something, and was known in our annals as, “the old Admiral,“ though
in history he had other titles. He was long in command of fleets of
swift vessels, well armed and, manned, and did great service in hurrying
up merchantmen. Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on,
always made good fair time across the ocean. But if a ship still
loitered in spite of all he could do, his indignation would grow till he
could contain himself no longer–and then he would take that ship home
where he lived and, keep it there carefully, expecting the owners to
come for it, but they never did. And he would try to get the idleness
and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling, them to take
invigorating exercise and a bath. He called it “walking a plank.“ All
the pupils liked it. At any rate, they never found any fault with it
after trying it. When the owners were late coming for their ships, the
Admiral always burned them, so that the insurance money should not be
lost. At last this fine old tar was cut down in the fulness of his years
and honors. And to her dying day, his poor heart-broken widow believed
that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been
resuscitated.</p>
<p>Charles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth
century, and was a zealous and distinguished missionary. He converted
sixteen thousand South Sea islanders, and taught them that a dog-tooth
necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to
divine service in. His poor flock loved him very, very dearly; and when
his funeral was over, they got up in a body (and came out of the
restaurant) with tears in their eyes, and saying, one to another, that
he was a good tender missionary, and they wished they had some more of
him.</p>
<p>PAH-GO-TO-WAH-WAH-PUKKETEKEEWIS (Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye) TWAIN
adorned the middle of the eighteenth century, and aided Gen. Braddock
with all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington. It was this
ancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree.
So far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books is
correct; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth
round the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being
reserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission, and he dared not
lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again, the narrative seriously
impairs the integrity of history. What he did say was:</p>
<p>“It ain’t no (hic !) no use. ‘At man’s so drunk he can’t stan’ still
long enough for a man to hit him. I (hic !) I can’t ’ford to fool away
any more am’nition on him!“</p>
<p>That was why he stopped at the seventeenth round, and it was, a good
plain matter-of-fact reason, too, and one that easily commends itself to
us by the eloquent, persuasive flavor of probability there is about
it.</p>
<p>I always enjoyed the story-book narrative, but I felt a marring
misgiving that every Indian at Braddock’s Defeat who fired at a soldier
a couple of times (two easily grows to seventeen in a century), and
missed him, jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving
that soldier for some grand mission; and so I somehow feared that the
only reason why Washington’s case is remembered and the others forgotten
is, that in his the prophecy’ came true, and in that of the others it
didn’t. There are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the
prophecies Indians and other unauthorized parties have made; but one may
carry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have
been fulfilled.</p>
<p>I will remark here, in passing, that certain ancestors of mine are so
thoroughly well known in history by their aliases, that I have not felt
it to be worth while to dwell upon them, or even mention them in the
order of their birth. Among these may be mentioned RICHARD BRINSLEY
TWAIN, alias Guy Fawkes; JOHN WENTWORTH TWAIN, alias Sixteen-String
Jack; WILLIAM HOGARTH TWAIN, alias Jack Sheppard; ANANIAS TWAIN, alias
Baron Munchausen; JOHN GEORGE TWAIN, alias Capt. Kydd; and them there
are George Francis Train, Tom Pepper, Nebuchadnezzar and Baalam’s
Ass–they all belong to our family, but to a branch of it somewhat
distantly removed from the honorable direct line–in fact, a collateral
branch, whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that, in
order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for,
they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting
hanged.</p>
<p>It is not well; when writing an autobiography, to follow your
ancestry down too close to your own time–it is safest to speak only
vaguely of your great-grandfather, and then skip from there to yourself,
which I now do.</p>
<p>I was born without teeth–and there Richard III had the advantage of
me; but I was born without a humpback, likewise, and there I had the
advantage of him. My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously
honest.</p>
<p>But now a thought occurs to me. My own history would really seem so
tame contrasted with that of my ancestors, that it is simply wisdom to
leave it unwritten until I am hanged. If some other biographies I have
read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred, it would
have been a felicitous thing, for the reading public. How does it strike
you?</p>
<p>AWFUL, TERRIBLE MEDIEVAL ROMANCE</p>
<h4 id="chapter-i-the-secret-revealed.">CHAPTER I THE SECRET
REVEALED.</h4>
<p>It was night. Stillness reigned in the grand old feudal castle of
Klugenstein. The year 1222 was drawing to a close. Far away up in the
tallest of the castle’s towers a single light glimmered. A secret
council was being held there. The stern old lord of Klugenstein sat in a
chair of state meditating. Presently he, said, with a tender accent:</p>
<p>“My daughter!“</p>
<p>A young man of noble presence, clad from head to heel in knightly
mail, answered:</p>
<p>“Speak, father!“</p>
<p>“My daughter, the time is come for the revealing of the mystery that
hath puzzled all your young life. Know, then, that it had its birth in
the matters which I shall now unfold. My brother Ulrich is the great
Duke of Brandenburgh. Our father, on his deathbed, decreed that if no
son were born to Ulrich, the succession should pass to my house,
provided a son were born to me. And further, in case no son, were born
to either, but only daughters, then the succession should pass to
Ulrich’s daughter, if she proved stainless; if she did not, my daughter
should succeed, if she retained a blameless name. And so I, and my old
wife here, prayed fervently for the good boon of a son, but the prayer
was vain. You were born to us. I was in despair. I saw the mighty prize
slipping from my grasp, the splendid dream vanishing away. And I had
been so hopeful! Five years had Ulrich lived in wedlock, and yet his
wife had borne no heir of either sex.</p>
<p>“‘But hold,’ I said, ‘all is not lost.’ A saving scheme had shot
athwart my brain. You were born at midnight. Only the leech, the nurse,
and six waiting-women knew your sex. I hanged them every one before an
hour had sped. Next morning all the barony went mad with rejoicing over
the proclamation that a son was born to Klugenstein, an heir to mighty
Brandenburgh! And well the secret has been kept. Your mother’s own
sister nursed your infancy, and from that time forward we feared
nothing.</p>
<p>“When you were ten years old, a daughter was born to Ulrich. We
grieved, but hoped for good results from measles, or physicians, or
other natural enemies of infancy, but were always disappointed. She
lived, she throve –Heaven’s malison upon her! But it is nothing. We are
safe. For, Ha-ha! have we not a son? And is not our son the future Duke?
Our well-beloved Conrad, is it not so?–for, woman of eight-and-twenty
years –as you are, my child, none other name than that hath ever fallen
to you!</p>
<p>“Now it hath come to pass that age hath laid its hand upon my
brother, and he waxes feeble. The cares of state do tax him sore.
Therefore he wills that you shall come to him and be already Duke–in
act, though not yet in name. Your servitors are ready–you journey forth
to-night.</p>
<p>“Now listen well. Remember every word I say. There is a law as old as
Germany that if any woman sit for a single instant in the great ducal
chair before she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the people,
SHE SHALL DIE! So heed my words. Pretend humility. Pronounce your
judgments from the Premier’s chair, which stands at the foot of the
throne. Do this until you are crowned and safe. It is not likely that
your sex will ever be discovered; but still it is the part of wisdom to
make all things as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life.“</p>
<p>“Oh; my father, is it for this my life hath been a lie! Was it that I
might cheat my unoffending cousin of her rights? Spare me, father, spare
your child!“</p>
<p>“What, huzzy! Is this my reward for the august fortune my brain has
wrought for thee? By the bones of my father, this puling sentiment of
thine but ill accords with my humor.</p>
<p>“Betake thee to the Duke, instantly! And beware how thou meddlest
with my purpose!“</p>
<p>Let this suffice, of the conversation. It is enough for us to know
that the prayers, the entreaties and the tears of the gentle-natured
girl availed nothing. They nor anything could move the stout old lord of
Klugenstein. And so, at last, with a heavy heart, the daughter saw the
castle gates close behind her, and found herself riding away in the
darkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed, vassals and a brave
following of servants.</p>
<p>The old baron sat silent for many minutes after his daughter’s
departure, and then he turned to his sad wife and said:</p>
<p>“Dame, our matters seem speeding fairly. It is full three months
since I sent the shrewd and handsome Count Detzin on his devilish
mission to my brother’s daughter Constance. If he fail, we are not
wholly safe; but if he do succeed, no power can bar our girl from being
Duchess e’en though ill-fortune should decree she never should be
Duke!“</p>
<p>“My heart is full of bodings, yet all may still be well.“</p>
<p>“Tush, woman! Leave the owls to croak. To bed with ye, and dream of
Brandenburgh and grandeur!“</p>
