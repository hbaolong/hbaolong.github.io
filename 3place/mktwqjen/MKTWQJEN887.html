<p>THE STORY OF A SPEECH</p>
<p>An address delivered in 1877, and a review of it twenty-nine years
later. The original speech was delivered at a dinner given by the
publishers of The Atlantic Monthly in honor of the seventieth
anniversary o f the birth of John Greenleaf Whittier, at the Hotel
Brunswick, Boston, December 17, 1877.</p>
<p>This is an occasion peculiarly meet for the digging up of pleasant
reminiscences concerning literary folk; therefore I will drop lightly
into history myself. Standing here on the shore of the Atlantic and
contemplating certain of its largest literary billows, I am reminded of
a thing which happened to me thirteen years ago, when I had just
succeeded in stirring up a little Nevadian literary puddle myself, whose
spume-flakes were beginning to blow thinly Californiaward. I started an
inspection tramp through the southern mines of California. I was callow
and conceited, and I resolved to try the virtue of my ‘nom de
guerre’.</p>
<p>I very soon had an opportunity. I knocked at a miner’s lonely log
cabin in the foot-hills of the Sierras just at nightfall. It was snowing
at the time. A jaded, melancholy man of fifty, barefooted, opened the
door to me. When he heard my ‘nom de guerre’ he looked more dejected
than before. He let me in–pretty reluctantly, I thought–and after the
customary bacon and beans, black coffee and hot whiskey, I took a pipe.
This sorrowful man had not said three words up to this time. Now he
spoke up and said, in the voice of one who is secretly suffering,
“You’re the fourth–I’m going to move.“ “The fourth what?“ said I. “The
fourth littery man that has been here in twenty-four hours–I’m going to
move.“ “You don’t tell me!“ said I; “who were the others?“
“Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson, and Mr. Oliver Wendell Holmes–consound the
lot!“</p>
<p>You can, easily believe I was interested. I supplicated–three hot
whiskeys did the rest–and finally the melancholy miner began. Said
he:</p>
<p>“They came here just at dark yesterday evening, and I let them in of
course. Said they were going to the Yosemite. They were a rough lot, but
that’s nothing; everybody looks rough that travels afoot. Mr. Emerson
was a seedy little bit of a chap, red-headed. Mr. Holmes was as fat as a
balloon; he weighed as much as three hundred, and had double chins all
the way down to his stomach. Mr. Longfellow was built like a
prizefighter. His head was cropped and bristly, like as if he had a wig
made of hair-brushes. His nose lay straight down, his face, like a
finger with the end joint tilted up. They had been drinking, I could see
that. And what queer talk they used! Mr. Holmes inspected this cabin,
then he took me by the buttonhole, and says he:</p>
<p>“‘Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings, Build
thee more stately mansions, O my soul!’</p>
<p>“Says I, ‘I can’t afford it, Mr. Holmes, and moreover I don’t want
to.’ Blamed if I liked it pretty well, either, coming from a stranger,
that way. However, I started to get out my bacon and beans, when
Mr. Emerson came and looked on awhile, and then he takes me aside by the
buttonhole and says:</p>
<p>“‘Give me agates for my meat; Give me cantharids to eat; From air and
ocean bring me foods, From all zones and altitudes.’</p>
<p>“Says I, ‘Mr. Emerson, if you’ll excuse me, this ain’t no hotel.’ You
see it sort of riled me–I warn’t used to the ways of littery swells. But
I went on a-sweating over my work, and next comes Mr. Longfellow and
buttonholes me, and interrupts me. Says he:</p>
<p>“‘Honor be to Mudjekeewis! You shall hear how Pau-Puk-Keewis–’</p>
<p>“But I broke in, and says I, ‘Beg your pardon, Mr. Longfellow, if
you’ll be so kind as to hold your yawp for about five minutes and let me
get this grub ready, you’ll do me proud.’ Well, sir, after they’d filled
up I set out the jug. Mr. Holmes looks at it, and then he fires up all
of a sudden and yells:</p>
<p>“Flash out a stream of blood-red wine! For I would drink to other
days.’</p>
<p>“By George, I was getting kind of worked up. I don’t deny it, I was
getting kind of worked up. I turns to Mr. Holmes, and says I, ‘Looky
here, my fat friend, I’m a-running this shanty, and if the court knows
herself, you’ll take whiskey straight or you’ll go dry.’ Them’s the very
words I said to him. Now I don’t want to sass such famous littery
people, but you see they kind of forced me. There ain’t nothing
onreasonable ‘bout me; I don’t mind a passel of guests a-treadin’ on my
tail three or four times, but when it comes to standing on it it’s
different, ‘and if the court knows herself,’ I says, ‘you’ll take
whiskey straight or you’ll go dry.’ Well, between drinks they’d swell
around the cabin and strike attitudes and spout; and pretty soon they
got out a greasy old deck and went to playing euchre at ten cents a
corner–on trust. I began to notice some pretty suspicious things.
Mr. Emerson dealt, looked at his hand, shook his head, says:</p>
<p>“‘I am the doubter and the doubt–’</p>
<p>and ca’mly bunched the hands and went to shuffling for a new layout.
Says he:</p>
<p>“‘They reckon ill who leave me out; They know not well the subtle
ways I keep. I pass and deal again!’</p>
<p>Hang’d if he didn’t go ahead and do it, too! Oh, he was a cool one!
Well, in about a minute things were running pretty tight, but all of a
sudden I see by Mr. Emerson’s eye he judged he had ’em. He had already
corralled two tricks, and each of the others one. So now he kind of
lifts a little in his chair and says:</p>
<p>“‘I tire of globes and aces! Too long the game is played!’</p>
<p>–and down he fetched a right bower. Mr. Longfellow smiles as sweet as
pie and says:</p>
<p>“‘Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend, For the lesson thou hast
taught,’</p>
<p>–and blamed if he didn’t down with another right bower! Emerson claps
his hand on his bowie, Longfellow claps his on his revolver, and I went
under a bunk. There was going to be trouble; but that monstrous Holmes
rose up, wobbling his double chins, and says he, ‘Order, gentlemen; the
first man that draws, I’ll lay down on him and smother him!’ All quiet
on the Potomac, you bet!</p>
<p>“They were pretty how-come-you-so’ by now, and they begun to blow.
Emerson says, ‘The nobbiest thing I ever wrote was “Barbara Frietchie.“’
Says Longfellow, ‘It don’t begin with my “Biglow Papers.“’ Says Holmes,
‘My “Thanatopsis“ lays over ’em both.’ They mighty near ended in a
fight. Then they wished they had some more company–and Mr. Emerson
pointed to me and says:</p>
<p>“‘Is yonder squalid peasant all That this proud nursery could
breed?’</p>
<p>He was a-whetting his bowie on his boot–so I let it pass. Well, sir,
next they took it into their heads that they would like some music; so
they made me stand up and sing “When Johnny Comes Marching Home“ till I
dropped-at thirteen minutes past four this morning. That’s what I’ve
been through, my friend. When I woke at seven, they were leaving, thank
goodness, and Mr. Longfellow had my only boots on, and his’n under his
arm. Says I, ‘Hold on, there, Evangeline, what are you going to do with
them?’ He says, ’Going to make tracks with ’em; because:</p>
<p>“‘Lives of great men all remind us We can make our lives sublime;
And, departing, leave behind us Footprints on the sands of time.’</p>
<p>“As I said, Mr. Twain, you are the fourth in twenty-four hours–and
I’m going to move; I ain’t suited to a littery atmosphere.“</p>
<p>I said to the miner, “Why, my dear sir, these were not the gracious
singers to whom we and the world pay loving reverence and homage; these
were impostors.“</p>
<p>The miner investigated me with a calm eye for a while; then said he,
“Ah! impostors, were they? Are you?“</p>
<p>I did not pursue the subject, and since then I have not travelled on
my ‘nom de guerre’ enough to hurt. Such was the reminiscence I was moved
to contribute, Mr. Chairman. In my enthusiasm I may have exaggerated the
details a little, but you will easily forgive me that fault, since I
believe it is the first time I have ever deflected from perpendicular
fact on an occasion like this.</p>
<p>…………………….</p>
<p>From Mark Twain’s Autobiography.</p>
<p>January 11, 1906.</p>
<p>Answer to a letter received this morning:</p>
<p>DEAR MRS. H.,–I am forever your debtor for reminding me of that
curious passage in my life. During the first year or, two after it
happened, I could not bear to think of it. My pain and shame were so
intense, and my sense of having been an imbecile so settled, established
and confirmed, that I drove the episode entirely from my mind–and so all
these twenty-eight or twenty-nine years I have lived in the conviction
that my performance of that time was coarse, vulgar, and destitute of
humor. But your suggestion that you and your family found humor in it
twenty-eight years ago moved me to look into the matter. So I
commissioned a Boston typewriter to delve among the Boston papers of
that bygone time and send me a copy of it.</p>
<p>It came this morning, and if there is any vulgarity about it I am not
able to discover it. If it isn’t innocently and ridiculously funny, I am
no judge. I will see to it that you get a copy.</p>
<p>What I have said to Mrs. H. is true. I did suffer during a year or
two from the deep humiliations of that episode. But at last, in 1888, in
Venice, my wife and I came across Mr. and Mrs. A. P. C., of Concord,
Massachusetts, and a friendship began then of the sort which nothing but
death terminates. The C.’s were very bright people and in every way
charming and companionable. We were together a month or two in Venice
and several months in Rome, afterward, and one day that lamented break
of mine was mentioned. And when I was on the point of lathering those
people for bringing it to my mind when I had gotten the memory of it
almost squelched, I perceived with joy that the C.’s were indignant
about the way that my performance had been received in Boston. They
poured out their opinions most freely and frankly about the frosty
attitude of the people who were present at that performance, and about
the Boston newspapers for the position they had taken in regard to the
matter. That position was that I had been irreverent beyond belief,
beyond imagination. Very well; I had accepted that as a fact for a year
or two, and had been thoroughly miserable about it whenever I thought of
it –which was not frequently, if I could help it. Whenever I thought of
it I wondered how I ever could have been inspired to do so unholy a
thing. Well, the C.’s comforted me, but they did not persuade me to
continue to think about the unhappy episode. I resisted that. I tried to
get it out of my mind, and let it die, and I succeeded. Until Mrs. H.’s
letter came, it had been a good twenty-five years since I had thought of
that matter; and when she said that the thing was funny I wondered if
possibly she might be right. At any rate, my curiosity was aroused, and
I wrote to Boston and got the whole thing copied, as above set
forth.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember some of the details of that gathering–dimly I can
see a hundred people–no, perhaps fifty–shadowy figures sitting at tables
feeding, ghosts now to me, and nameless forevermore. I don’t know who
they were, but I can very distinctly see, seated at the grand table and
facing the rest of us, Mr. Emerson, supernaturally grave, unsmiling;
Mr. Whittier, grave, lovely, his beautiful spirit shining out of his
face; Mr. Longfellow, with his silken white hair and his benignant face;
Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, flashing smiles and affection and all
good-fellowship everywhere like a rose-diamond whose facets are being
turned toward the light first one way and then another–a charming man,
and always fascinating, whether he was talking or whether he was sitting
still (what he would call still, but what would be more or less motion
to other people). I can see those figures with entire distinctness
across this abyss of time.</p>
<p>One other feature is clear–Willie Winter (for these past thousand
years dramatic editor of the New York Tribune, and still occupying that
high post in his old age) was there. He was much younger then than he is
now, and he showed ’it. It was always a pleasure to me to see Willie
Winter at a banquet. During a matter of twenty years I was seldom at a
banquet where Willie Winter was not also present, and where he did not
read a charming poem written for the occasion. He did it this time, and
it was up to standard: dainty, happy, choicely phrased, and as good to
listen to as music, and sounding exactly as if it was pouring unprepared
out of heart and brain.</p>
<p>Now at that point ends all that was pleasurable about that notable
celebration of Mr. Whittier’s seventieth birthday–because I got up at
that point and followed Winter, with what I have no doubt I supposed
would be the gem of the evening–the gay oration above quoted from the
Boston paper. I had written it all out the day before and had perfectly
memorized it, and I stood up there at my genial and happy and
self-satisfied ease, and began to deliver it. Those majestic guests;
that row of venerable and still active volcanoes, listened; as did
everybody else in the house, with attentive interest. Well, I delivered
myself of–we’ll say the first two hundred words of my speech. I was
expecting no returns from that part of the speech, but this was not the
case as regarded the rest of it. I arrived now at the dialogue: “The old
miner said, ‘You are the fourth, I’m going to move.’ ‘The fourth what?’
said I. He answered, ‘The fourth littery man that has been here in
twenty-four hours. I am going to move.’ ‘Why, you don’t tell me;’ said
I. ‘Who were the others?’ ‘Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Emerson, Mr. Oliver
Wendell Holmes, consound the lot–’“</p>
<p>Now, then, the house’s attention continued, but the expression of
interest in the faces turned to a sort of black frost. I wondered what
the trouble was. I didn’t know. I went on, but with difficulty –I
struggled along, and entered upon that miner’s fearful description of
the bogus Emerson, the bogus Holmes, the bogus Longfellow, always hoping
–but with a gradually perishing hope that somebody–would laugh, or that
somebody would at least smile, but nobody did. I didn’t know enough to
give it up and sit down, I was too new to public speaking, and so I went
on with this awful performance, and carried it clear through to the end,
in front of a body of people who seemed turned to stone with horror. It
was the sort of expression their faces would have worn if I had been
making these remarks about the Deity and the rest of the Trinity; there
is no milder way, in which to describe the petrified condition and the
ghastly expression of those people.</p>
<p>When I sat down it was with a heart which had long ceased to beat. I
shall never be as dead again as I was then. I shall never be as
miserable again as I was then. I speak now as one who doesn’t know what
the condition of things may be in the next world, but in this one I
shall never be as wretched again as I was then. Howells, who was near
me, tried to say a comforting word, but couldn’t get beyond a gasp.
There was no use–he understood the whole size of the disaster. He had
good intentions, but the words froze before they could get out. It was
an atmosphere that would freeze anything. If Benvenuto Cellini’s
salamander had been in that place he would not have survived to be put
into Cellini’s autobiography. There was a frightful pause. There was an
awful silence, a desolating silence. Then the next man on the list had
to get up–there was no help for it. That was Bishop–Bishop had just
burst handsomely upon the world with a most acceptable novel, which had
appeared in The Atlantic Monthly, a place which would make any novel
respectable and any author noteworthy. In this case the novel itself was
recognized as being, without extraneous help, respectable. Bishop was
away up in the public favor, and he was an object of high interest,
consequently there was a sort of national expectancy in the air; we may
say our American millions were standing, from Maine to Texas and from
Alaska to Florida, holding their breath, their lips parted, their hands
ready to applaud, when Bishop should get up on that occasion, and for
the first time in his life speak in public. It was under these damaging
conditions that he got up to “make good,“ as the vulgar say. I had
spoken several times before, and that is the reason why I was able to go
on without dying in my tracks, as I ought to have done–but Bishop had
had no experience. He was up facing those awful deities–facing those
other people, those strangers–facing human beings for the first time in
his life, with a speech to utter. No doubt it was well packed away in
his memory, no doubt it was fresh and usable, until I had been heard
from. I suppose that after that, and under the smothering pall of that
dreary silence, it began to waste away and disappear out of his head
like the rags breaking from the edge of a fog, and presently there
wasn’t any fog left. He didn’t go on–he didn’t last long. It was not
many sentence’s after his first before he began to hesitate, and break,
and lose his grip, and totter, and wobble, and at last he slumped down
in a limp and mushy pile.</p>
<p>Well, the programme for the occasion was probably not more than
one-third finished, but it ended there. Nobody rose. The next man hadn’t
strength enough to get up, and everybody looked so dazed, so stupefied,
paralyzed; it was impossible for anybody to do anything, or even try.
Nothing could go on in that strange atmosphere. Howells mournfully, and
without words, hitched himself to Bishop and me and supported us out of
the room. It was very kind–he was most generous. He towed us tottering
away into same room in that building, and we sat down there. I don’t
know what my remark was now, but I know the nature of it. It was the
kind of remark you make when you know that nothing in the world can help
your case. But Howells was honest–he had to say the heart-breaking
things he did say: that there was no help for this calamity, this
shipwreck, this cataclysm; that this was the most disastrous thing that
had ever happened in anybody’s history–and then he added, “That is, for
you–and consider what you have done for Bishop. It is bad enough in your
case, you deserve, to suffer. You have committed this crime, and you
deserve to have all you are going to get. But here is an innocent man.
Bishop had never done you any harm, and see what you have done to him.
He can never hold his head up again. The world can never look upon
Bishop as being a live person. He is a corpse.“</p>
<p>That is the history of that episode of twenty-eight years ago, which
pretty nearly killed me with shame during that first year or two
whenever it forced its way into my mind.</p>
<p>Now then, I take that speech up and examine it. As I said, it arrived
this morning, from Boston. I have read it twice, and unless I am an
idiot, it hasn’t a single defect in it from the first word to the last.
It is just as good as good can be. It is smart; it is saturated with
humor. There isn’t a suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in it
anywhere. What could have been the matter with that house? It is
amazing, it is incredible, that they didn’t shout with laughter, and
those deities the loudest of them all. Could the fault have been with
me? Did I lose courage when I saw those great men up there whom I was
going to describe in such a strange fashion? If that happened, if I
showed doubt, that can account for it, for you can’t be successfully
funny if you show that you are afraid of it. Well, I can’t account for
it, but if I had those beloved and revered old literary immortals back
here now on the platform at Carnegie Hall I would take that same old
speech, deliver it, word for word, and melt them till they’d run all
over that stage. Oh, the fault must have been with me, it is not in the
speech at all.</p>
<p>PLYMOUTH ROCK AND THE PILGRIMS</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE FIRST ANNUAL DINNER, N. E. SOCIETY, PHILADELPHIA,
DECEMBER 22, 1881</p>
<p>On calling upon Mr. Clemens to make response, President Rollins
said:</p>
<p>“This sentiment has been assigned to one who was never exactly born
in New England, nor, perhaps, were any of his ancestors. He is not
technically, therefore, of New England descent. Under the painful
circumstances in which he has found himself, however, he has done the
best he could–he has had all his children born there, and has made of
himself a New England ancestor. He is a self-made man. More than this,
and better even, in cheerful, hopeful, helpful literature he is of New
England ascent. To ascend there in any thing that’s reasonable is
difficult; for–confidentially, with the door shut–we all know that they
are the brightest, ablest sons of that goodly land who never leave it,
and it is among and above them that Mr. Twain has made his brilliant and
permanent ascent–become a man of mark.“</p>
<p>I rise to protest. I have kept still for years; but really I think
there is no sufficient justification for this sort of thing. What do you
want to celebrate those people for?–those ancestors of yours of 1620–the
Mayflower tribe, I mean. What do you want to celebrate them for? Your
pardon: the gentleman at my left assures me that you are not celebrating
the Pilgrims themselves, but the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth
rock on the 22d of December. So you are celebrating their landing. Why,
the other pretext was thin enough, but this is thinner than ever; the
other was tissue, tinfoil, fish-bladder, but this is gold-leaf.
Celebrating their lauding! What was there remarkable about it, I would
like to know? What can you be thinking of? Why, those Pilgrims had been
at sea three or four months. It was the very middle of winter: it was as
cold as death off Cape Cod there. Why shouldn’t they come ashore? If
they hadn’t landed there would be some reason for celebrating the fact:
It would have been a case of monumental leatherheadedness which the
world would not willingly let die. If it had been you, gentlemen, you
probably wouldn’t have landed, but you have no shadow of right to be
celebrating, in your ancestors, gifts which they did not exercise, but
only transmitted. Why, to be celebrating the mere landing of the
Pilgrims –to be trying to make out that this most natural and simple and
customary procedure was an extraordinary circumstance–a circumstance to
be amazed at, and admired, aggrandized and glorified, at orgies like
this for two hundred and sixty years–hang it, a horse would have known
enough to land; a horse–Pardon again; the gentleman on my right assures
me that it was not merely the landing of the Pilgrims that we are
celebrating, but the Pilgrims themselves. So we have struck an
inconsistency here –one says it was the landing, the other says it was
the Pilgrims. It is an inconsistency characteristic of your intractable
and disputatious tribe, for you never agree about anything but Boston.
Well, then, what do you want to celebrate those Pilgrims for? They were
a mighty hard lot–you know it. I grant you, without the slightest
unwillingness, that they were a deal more gentle and merciful and just
than were the people of Europe of that day; I grant you that they are
better than their predecessors. But what of that?–that is nothing.
People always progress. You are better than your fathers and
grandfathers were (this is the first time I have ever aimed a
measureless slander at the departed, for I consider such things
improper). Yes, those among you who have not been in the penitentiary,
if such there be, are better than your fathers and grandfathers were;
but is that any sufficient reason, for getting up annual dinners and
celebrating you? No, by no means–by no means. Well, I repeat, those
Pilgrims were a hard lot. They took good care of themselves, but they
abolished everybody else’s ancestors. I am a border-ruffian from the
State of Missouri. I am a Connecticut Yankee by adoption. In me, you
have Missouri morals, Connecticut culture; this, gentlemen, is the
combination which makes the perfect man. But where are my ancestors?
Whom shall I celebrate? Where shall I find the raw material?</p>
<p>My first American ancestor, gentlemen, was an Indian–an early Indian.
Your ancestors skinned him alive, and I am an orphan. Not one drop of my
blood flows in that Indian’s veins today. I stand here, lone and
forlorn, without an ancestor. They skinned him! I do not object to that,
if they needed his fur; but alive, gentlemen-alive! They skinned him
alive–and before company! That is what rankles. Think how he must have
felt; for he was a sensitive person and easily embarrassed. If he had
been a bird, it would have been all right, and no violence done to his
feelings, because he would have been considered “dressed.“ But he was
not a bird, gentlemen, he was a man, and probably one of the most
undressed men that ever was. I ask you to put yourselves in his place. I
ask it as a favor; I ask it as a tardy act of justice; I ask it in the
interest of fidelity to the traditions of your ancestors; I ask it that
the world may contemplate, with vision unobstructed by disguising
swallow-tails and white cravats, the spectacle which the true New
England Society ought to present. Cease to come to these annual orgies
in this hollow modern mockery–the surplusage of raiment. Come in
character; come in the summer grace, come in the unadorned simplicity,
come in the free and joyous costume which your sainted ancestors
provided for mine.</p>
<p>Later ancestors of mine were the Quakers William Robinson, Marmaduke
Stevenson, et al. Your tribe chased them put of the country for their
religion’s sake; promised them death if they came back; for your
ancestors had forsaken the homes they loved, and braved the perils of
the sea, the implacable climate, and the savage wilderness, to acquire
that highest and most precious of boons, freedom for every man on this
broad continent to worship according to the dictates of his own
conscience–and they were not going to allow a lot of pestiferous Quakers
to interfere with it. Your ancestors broke forever the chains of
political slavery, and gave the vote to every man in this wide land,
excluding none!–none except those who did not belong to the orthodox
church. Your ancestors –yes, they were a hard lot; but, nevertheless,
they gave us religious liberty to worship as they required us to
worship, and political liberty to vote as the church required; and so I
the bereft one, I the forlorn one, am here to do my best to help you
celebrate them right.</p>
<p>The Quaker woman Elizabeth Hooton was an ancestress of mine. Your
people were pretty severe with her you will confess that. But, poor
thing! I believe they changed her opinions before she died, and took her
into their fold; and so we have every reason to presume that when she
died she went to the same place which your ancestors went to. It is a
great pity, for she was a good woman. Roger Williams was an ancestor of
mine. I don’t really remember what your people did with him. But they
banished him to Rhode Island, anyway. And then, I believe, recognizing
that this was really carrying harshness to an unjustifiable extreme,
they took pity on him and burned him. They were a hard lot! All those
Salem witches were ancestors of mine! Your people made it tropical for
them. Yes, they did; by pressure and the gallows they made such a clean
deal with them that there hasn’t been a witch and hardly a halter in our
family from that day to this, and that is one hundred and eighty-nine
years. The first slave brought into New England out of Africa by your
progenitors was an ancestor of mine–for I am of a mixed breed, an
infinitely shaded and exquisite Mongrel. I’m not one of your sham
meerschaums that you can color in a week. No, my complexion is the
patient art of eight generations. Well, in my own time, I had acquired a
lot of my kin–by purchase, and swapping around, and one way and another
–and was getting along very well. Then, with the inborn perversity of
your lineage, you got up a war, and took them all away from me. And so,
again am I bereft, again am I forlorn; no drop of my blood flows in the
veins of any living being who is marketable.</p>
<p>O my friends, hear me and reform! I seek your good, not mine. You
have heard the speeches. Disband these New England societies–nurseries
of a system of steadily augmenting laudation and hosannaing, which; if
persisted in uncurbed, may some day in the remote future beguile you
into prevaricating and bragging. Oh, stop, stop, while you are still
temperate in your appreciation of your ancestors! Hear me, I beseech
you; get up an auction and sell Plymouth Rock! The Pilgrims were a
simple and ignorant race. They never had seen any good rocks before, or
at least any that were not watched, and so they were excusable for
hopping ashore in frantic delight and clapping an iron fence around this
one. But you, gentlemen, are educated; you are enlightened; you know
that in the rich land of your nativity, opulent New England, overflowing
with rocks, this one isn’t worth, at the outside, more than thirty-five
cents. Therefore, sell it, before it is injured by exposure, or at least
throw it open to the patent-medicine advertisements, and let it earn its
taxes:</p>
<p>Yes, hear your true friend-your only true friend–list to his voice.
Disband these societies, hotbeds of vice, of moral decay–perpetuators of
ancestral superstition. Here on this board I see water, I see milk, I
see the wild and deadly lemonade. These are but steps upon the downward
path. Next we shall see tea, then chocolate, then coffee–hotel coffee. A
few more years–all too few, I fear–mark my words, we shall have cider!
Gentlemen, pause ere it be too late. You are on the broad road which
leads to dissipation, physical ruin, moral decay, gory crime and the
gallows! I beseech you, I implore you, in the name of your anxious
friends, in the name of your suffering families, in the name of your
impending widows and orphans, stop ere it be too late. Disband these New
England societies, renounce these soul-blistering saturnalia, cease from
varnishing the rusty reputations of your long-vanished ancestors–the
super-high-moral old iron-clads of Cape Cod, the pious buccaneers of
Plymouth Rock–go home, and try to learn to behave!</p>
<p>However, chaff and nonsense aside, I think I honor and appreciate
your Pilgrim stock as much as you do yourselves, perhaps; and I endorse
and adopt a sentiment uttered by a grandfather of mine once–a man of
sturdy opinions, of sincere make of mind, and not given to flattery. He
said: “People may talk as they like about that Pilgrim stock, but, after
all’s said and done, it would be pretty hard to improve on those people;
and, as for me, I don’t mind coming out flatfooted and saying there
ain’t any way to improve on them–except having them born in,
Missouri!“</p>
<p>COMPLIMENTS AND DEGREES</p>
<p>DELIVERED AT THE LOTOS CLUB, JANUARY 11, 1908</p>
<p>In introducing Mr. Clemens, Frank R. Lawrence, the President of the
Lotos Club, recalled the fact that the first club dinner in the present
club-house, some fourteen years ago, was in honor of Mark Twain.</p>
<p>I wish to begin this time at the beginning, lest I forget it
altogether; that is to say, I wish to thank you for this welcome that
you are giving, and the welcome which you gave me seven years ago, and
which I forgot to thank you for at that time. I also wish to thank you
for the welcome you gave me fourteen years ago, which I also forgot to
thank you for at the time.</p>
<p>I hope you will continue this custom to give me a dinner every seven
years before I join the hosts in the other world–I do not know which
world.</p>
<p>Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Porter have paid me many compliments. It is very
difficult to take compliments. I do not care whether you deserve the
compliments or not, it is just as difficult to take them. The other
night I was at the Engineers’ Club, and enjoyed the sufferings of
Mr. Carnegie. They were complimenting him there; there it was all
compliments, and none of them deserved. They say that you cannot live by
bread alone, but I can live on compliments.</p>
<p>I do not make any pretence that I dislike compliments. The stronger
the better, and I can manage to digest them. I think I have lost so much
by not making a collection of compliments, to put them away and take
them out again once in a while. When in England I said that I would
start to collect compliments, and I began there and I have brought some
of them along.</p>
<p>The first one of these lies–I wrote them down and preserved them –I
think they are mighty good and extremely just. It is one of Hamilton
Mabie’s compliments. He said that La Salle was the first one to make a
voyage of the Mississippi, but Mark Twain was the first to chart, light,
and navigate it for the whole world.</p>
<p>If that had been published at the time that I issued that book [Life
on the Mississippi], it would have been money in my pocket. I tell you,
it is a talent by itself to pay compliments gracefully and have them
ring true. It’s an art by itself.</p>
<p>Here is another compliment by Albert Bigelow Paine, my biographer. He
is writing four octavo volumes about me, and he has been at my elbow two
and one-half years.</p>
<p>I just suppose that he does not know me, but says he knows me. He
says “Mark Twain is not merely a great writer, a great philosopher, a
great man; he is the supreme expression of the human being, with his
strength and his weakness.“ What a talent for compression! It takes a
genius in compression to compact as many facts as that.</p>
<p>W. D. Howells spoke of me as first of Hartford, and ultimately of the
solar system, not to say of the universe:</p>
<p>You know how modest Howells is. If it can be proved that my fame
reaches to Neptune and Saturn; that will satisfy even me. You know how
modest and retiring Howells seems to be, but deep down he is as vain as
I am.</p>
<p>Mr. Howells had been granted a degree at Oxford, whose gown was red.
He had been invited to an exercise at Columbia, and upon inquiry had
been told that it was usual to wear the black gown: Later he had found
that three other men wore bright gowns, and he had lamented that he had
been one of the black mass, and not a red torch.</p>
<p>Edison wrote: “The average American loves his family. If he has any
love left over for some other person, he generally selects Mark
Twain.“</p>
<p>Now here’s the compliment of a little Montana girl which came to me
indirectly. She was in a room in which there was a large photograph of
me. After gazing at it steadily for a time, she said:</p>
<p>“We’ve got a John the Baptist like that.“ She also said: “Only ours
has more trimmings.“</p>
<p>I suppose she meant the halo. Now here is a gold-miner’s compliment.
It is forty-two years old. It was my introduction to an audience to
which I lectured in a log school-house. There were no ladies there. I
wasn’t famous then. They didn’t know me. Only the miners were there,
with their breeches tucked into their boottops and with clay all over
them. They wanted some one to introduce me, and they selected a miner,
who protested, saying:</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything about this man. Anyhow, I only know two things
about him. One is, he has never been in jail, and the other is, I don’t
know why.“</p>
<p>There’s one thing I want to say about that English trip. I knew his
Majesty the King of England long years ago, and I didn’t meet him for
the first time then. One thing that I regret was that some newspapers
said I talked with the Queen of England with my hat on. I don’t do that
with any woman. I did not put it on until she asked me to. Then she told
me to put it on, and it’s a command there. I thought I had carried my
American democracy far enough. So I put it on. I have no use for a hat,
and never did have.</p>
<p>Who was it who said that the police of London knew me? Why, the
police know me everywhere. There never was a day over there when a
policeman did not salute me, and then put up his hand and stop the
traffic of the world. They treated me as though I were a duchess.</p>
<p>The happiest experience I had in England was at a dinner given in the
building of the Punch publication, a humorous paper which is appreciated
by all Englishmen. It was the greatest privilege ever allowed a
foreigner. I entered the dining-room of the building, where those men
get together who have been running the paper for over fifty years. We
were about to begin dinner when the toastmaster said: “Just a minute;
there ought to be a little ceremony.“ Then there was that meditating
silence for a while, and out of a closet there came a beautiful little
girl dressed in pink, holding in her hand a copy of the previous week’s
paper, which had in it my cartoon. It broke me all up. I could not even
say “Thank you.“ That was the prettiest incident of the dinner, the
delight of all that wonderful table. When she was about to go; I said,
“My child, you are not going to leave me; I have hardly got acquainted
with you.“ She replied, “You know I’ve got to go; they never let me come
in here before, and they never will again.“ That is one of the beautiful
incidents that I cherish.</p>
<p>[At the conclusion of his speech, and while the diners were still
cheering him, Colonel Porter brought forward the red-and-gray gown of
the Oxford “doctor,“ and Mr. Clemens was made to don it. The diners rose
to their feet in their enthusiasm. With the mortar-board on his head,
and looking down admiringly at himself, Mr. Twain said–]</p>
<p>I like that gown. I always did like red. The redder it is the better
I like it. I was born for a savage. Now, whoever saw any red like this?
There is no red outside the arteries of an archangel that could compare
with this. I know you all envy me. I am going to have luncheon shortly
with ladies just ladies. I will be the only lady of my sex present, and
I shall put on this gown and make those ladies look dim.</p>
<p>BOOKS, AUTHORS, AND HATS</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE PILGRIMS’ CLUB LUNCHEON, GIVEN IN HONOR OF Mr. CLEMENS
AT THE SAVOY HOTEL, LONDON, JUNE 25, 1907.</p>
<p>Mr. Birrell, M.P., Chief-Secretary for Ireland, in introducing
Mr. Clemens said: “We all love Mark Twain, and we are here to tell him
so. One more point–all the world knows it, and that is why it is
dangerous to omit it–our guest is a distinguished citizen of the Great
Republic beyond the seas. In America his ‘Huckleberry Finn’ and his ‘Tom
Sawyer’ are what ‘Robinson Crusoe’ and ‘Tom Brown’s School Days’ have
been to us. They are racy of the soil. They are books to which it is
impossible to place any period of termination. I will not speak of the
classics–reminiscences of much evil in our early lives. We do not meet
here to-day as critics with our appreciations and depreciations, our
twopenny little prefaces or our forewords. I am not going to say what
the world a thousand years hence will think of Mark Twain. Posterity
will take care of itself, will read what it wants to read, will forget
what it chooses to forget, and will pay no attention whatsoever to our
critical mumblings and jumblings. Let us therefore be content to say to
our friend and guest that we are here speaking for ourselves and for our
children, to say what he has been to us. I remember in Liverpool, in
1867, first buying the copy, which I still preserve, of the celebrated
‘Jumping Frog.’ It had a few words of preface which reminded me then
that our guest in those days was called ‘the wild humorist of the
Pacific slope,’ and a few lines later down, ‘the moralist of the Main.’
That was some forty years ago. Here he is, still the humorist, still the
moralist. His humor enlivens and enlightens his morality, and his
morality is all the better for his humor. That is one of the reasons why
we love him. I am not here to mention any book of his–that is a subject
of dispute in my family circle, which is the best and which is the next
best–but I must put in a word, lest I should not be true to myself–a
terrible thing –for his Joan of Arc, a book of chivalry, of nobility,
and of manly sincerity for which I take this opportunity of thanking
him. But you can all drink this toast, each one of you with his own
intention. You can get into it what meaning you like. Mark Twain is a
man whom English and Americans do well to honor. He is the true
consolidator of nations. His delightful humor is of the kind which
dissipates and destroys national prejudices. His truth and his honor,
his love of truth, and his love of honor, overflow all boundaries. He
has made the world better by his presence. We rejoice to see him here.
Long may he live to reap the plentiful harvest of hearty, honest human
affection!“</p>
<p>Pilgrims, I desire first to thank those undergraduates of Oxford.
When a man has grown so old as I am, when he has reached the verge of
seventy-two years, there is nothing that carries him back to the
dreamland of his life, to his boyhood, like recognition of those young
hearts up yonder. And so I thank them out of my heart. I desire to thank
the Pilgrims of New York also for their kind notice and message which
they have cabled over here. Mr. Birrell says he does not know how he got
here. But he will be able to get away all right–he has not drunk
anything since he came here. I am glad to know about those friends of
his, Otway and Chatterton–fresh, new names to me. I am glad of the
disposition he has shown to rescue them from the evils of poverty, and
if they are still in London, I hope to have a talk with them. For a
while I thought he was going to tell us the effect which my book had
upon his growing manhood. I thought he was going to tell us how much
that effect amounted to, and whether it really made him what he now is,
but with the discretion born of Parliamentary experience he dodged that,
and we do not know now whether he read the book or not. He did that very
neatly. I could not do it any better myself.</p>
<p>My books have had effects, and very good ones, too, here and there,
and some others not so good. There is no doubt about that. But I
remember one monumental instance of it years and years ago. Professor
Norton, of Harvard, was over here, and when he came back to Boston I
went out with Howells to call on him. Norton was allied in some way by
marriage with Darwin.</p>
<p>Mr. Norton was very gentle in what he had to say, and almost
delicate, and he said: “Mr. Clemens, I have been spending some time with
Mr. Darwin in England, and I should like to tell you something connected
with that visit. You were the object of it, and I myself would have been
very proud of it, but you may not be proud of it. At any rate, I am
going to tell you what it was, and to leave to you to regard it as you
please. Mr. Darwin took me up to his bedroom and pointed out certain
things there-pitcher-plants, and so on, that he was measuring and
watching from day to day–and he said: ‘The chambermaid is permitted to
do what she pleases in this room, but she must never touch those plants
and never touch those books on that table by that candle. With those
books I read myself to sleep every night.’ Those were your own books.“ I
said: “There is no question to my mind as to whether I should regard
that as a compliment or not. I do regard it as a very great compliment
and a very high honor that that great mind, laboring for the whole human
race, should rest itself on my books. I am proud that he should read
himself to sleep with them.“</p>
<p>Now, I could not keep that to myself–I was so proud of it. As soon as
I got home to Hartford I called up my oldest friend–and dearest enemy on
occasion–the Rev. Joseph Twichell, my pastor, and I told him about that,
and, of course, he was full of interest and venom. Those people who get
no compliments like that feel like that. He went off. He did not issue
any applause of any kind, and I did not hear of that subject for some
time. But when Mr. Darwin passed away from this life, and some time
after Darwin’s Life and Letters came out, the Rev. Mr. Twichell procured
an early copy of that work and found something in it which he considered
applied to me. He came over to my house–it was snowing, raining,
sleeting, but that did not make any difference to Twichell. He produced
the book, and turned over and over, until he came to a certain place,
when he said: “Here, look at this letter from Mr. Darwin to Sir Joseph
Hooker.“ What Mr. Darwin said–I give you the idea and not the very
words–was this: I do not know whether I ought to have devoted my whole
life to these drudgeries in natural history and the other sciences or
not, for while I may have gained in one way I have lost in another. Once
I had a fine perception and appreciation of high literature, but in me
that quality is atrophied. “That was the reason,“ said Mr. Twichell, “he
was reading your books.“</p>
<p>Mr. Birrell has touched lightly–very lightly, but in not an
uncomplimentary way–on my position in this world as a moralist. I am
glad to have that recognition, too, because I have suffered since I have
been in this town; in the first place, right away, when I came here,
from a newsman going around with a great red, highly displayed placard
in the place of an apron. He was selling newspapers, and there were two
sentences on that placard which would have been all right if they had
been punctuated; but they ran those two sentences together without a
comma or anything, and that would naturally create a wrong impression,
because it said, “Mark Twain arrives Ascot Cup stolen.“ No doubt many a
person was misled by those sentences joined together in that unkind way.
I have no doubt my character has suffered from it. I suppose I ought to
defend my character, but how can I defend it? I can say here and now
–and anybody can see by my face that I am sincere, that I speak the
truth –that I have never seen that Cup. I have not got the Cup–I did not
have a chance to get it. I have always had a good character in that way.
I have hardly ever stolen anything, and if I did steal anything I had
discretion enough to know about the value of it first. I do not steal
things that are likely to get myself into trouble. I do not think any of
us do that. I know we all take things–that is to be expected–but really,
I have never taken anything, certainly in England, that amounts to any
great thing. I do confess that when I was here seven years ago I stole a
hat, but that did not amount to anything. It was not a good hat, and was
only a clergyman’s hat, anyway.</p>
<p>I was at a luncheon party, and Archdeacon Wilberforce was there also.
I dare say he is Archdeacon now–he was a canon then–and he was serving
in the Westminster battery, if that is the proper term–I do not know, as
you mix military and ecclesiastical things together so much. He left the
luncheon table before I did. He began this. I did steal his hat, but he
began by taking mine. I make that interjection because I would not
accuse Archdeacon Wilberforce of stealing my hat–I should not think of
it. I confine that phrase to myself. He merely took my hat. And with
good judgment, too–it was a better hat than his. He came out before the
luncheon was over, and sorted the hats in the hall, and selected one
which suited. It happened to be mine. He went off with it. When I came
out by-and-by there was no hat there which would go on my head except
his, which was left behind. My head was not the customary size just at
that time. I had been receiving a good many very nice and complimentary
attentions, and my head was a couple of sizes larger than usual, and his
hat just suited me. The bumps and corners were all right intellectually.
There were results pleasing to me–possibly so to him. He found out whose
hat it was, and wrote me saying it was pleasant that all the way home,
whenever he met anybody his gravities, his solemnities, his deep
thoughts, his eloquent remarks were all snatched up by the people he
met, and mistaken for brilliant humorisms.</p>
<p>I had another experience. It was not unpleasing. I was received with
a deference which was entirely foreign to my experience by everybody
whom I met, so that before I got home I had a much higher opinion of
myself than I have ever had before or since. And there is in that very
connection an incident which I remember at that old date which is rather
melancholy to me, because it shows how a person can deteriorate in a
mere seven years. It is seven years ago. I have not that hat now. I was
going down Pall-Mall, or some other of your big streets, and I
recognized that that hat needed ironing. I went into a big shop and
passed in my hat, and asked that it might be ironed. They were
courteous, very courteous, even courtly. They brought that hat back to
me presently very sleek and nice, and I asked how much there was to pay.
They replied that they did not charge the clergy anything. I have
cherished the delight of that moment from that day to this. It was the
first thing I did the other day to go and hunt up that shop and hand in
my hat to have it ironed. I said when it came back, “How much to pay?“
They said, “Ninepence.“ In seven years I have acquired all that
worldliness, and I am sorry to be back where I was seven years ago.</p>
<p>But now I am chaffing and chaffing and chaffing here, and I hope you
will forgive me for that; but when a man stands on the verge of
seventy-two you know perfectly well that he never reached that place
without knowing what this life is heart-breaking bereavement. And so our
reverence is for our dead. We do not forget them; but our duty is toward
the living; and if we can be cheerful, cheerful in spirit, cheerful in
speech and in hope, that is a benefit to those who are around us.</p>
<p>My own history includes an incident which will always connect me with
England in a pathetic way, for when I arrived here seven years ago with
my wife and my daughter–we had gone around the globe lecturing to raise
money to clear off a debt–my wife and one of my daughters started across
the ocean to bring to England our eldest daughter. She was twenty four
years of age and in the bloom of young womanhood, and we were
unsuspecting. When my wife and daughter–and my wife has passed from this
life since–when they had reached mid Atlantic, a cablegram–one of those
heartbreaking cablegrams which we all in our days have to experience–was
put into my hand. It stated that that daughter of ours had gone to her
long sleep. And so, as I say, I cannot always be cheerful, and I cannot
always be chaffing; I must sometimes lay the cap and bells aside, and
recognize that I am of the human race like the rest, and must have my
cares and griefs. And therefore I noticed what Mr. Birrell said–I was so
glad to hear him say it–something that was in the nature of these verses
here at the top of this:</p>
<p>“He lit our life with shafts of sun And vanquished pain. Thus two
great nations stand as one In honoring Twain.“</p>
<p>I am very glad to have those verses. I am very glad and very grateful
for what Mr. Birrell said in that connection. I have received since I
have been here, in this one week, hundreds of letters from all
conditions of people in England–men, women, and children–and there is in
them compliment, praise, and, above all and better than all, there is in
them a note of affection. Praise is well, compliment is well, but
affection –that is the last and final and most precious reward that any
man can win, whether by character or achievement, and I am very grateful
to have that reward. All these letters make me feel that here in
England–as in America–when I stand under the English flag, I am not a
stranger. I am not an alien, but at home.</p>
<p>DEDICATION SPEECH</p>
<p>AT THE DEDICATION OF THE COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK, MAY 16,
1908</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens wore his gown as Doctor of Laws, Oxford University.
Ambassador Bryce and Mr. Choate had made the formal addresses.</p>
<p>How difficult, indeed, is the higher education. Mr. Choate needs a
little of it. He is not only short as a statistician of New York, but he
is off, far off, in his mathematics. The four thousand citizens of
Greater New York, indeed!</p>
<p>But I don’t think it was wise or judicious on the part of Mr. Choate
to show this higher education he has obtained. He sat in the lap of that
great education (I was there at the time), and see the result–the
lamentable result. Maybe if he had had a sandwich here to sustain him
the result would not have been so serious.</p>
<p>For seventy-two years I have been striving to acquire that higher
education which stands for modesty and diffidence, and it doesn’t
work.</p>
<p>And then look at Ambassador Bryce, who referred to his alma mater,
Oxford. He might just as well have included me. Well, I am a later
production.</p>
<p>If I am the latest graduate, I really and sincerely hope I am not the
final flower of its seven centuries; I hope it may go on for seven ages
longer.</p>
<p>DIE SCHRECKEN DER DEUTSCHEN SPRACHE [THE HORRORS OF THE GERMAN
LANGUAGE]</p>
<p>ADDRESS TO THE VIENNA PRESS CLUB, NOVEMBER 21, 1897, DELIVERED IN
GERMAN [Here in literal translation]</p>
<p>It has me deeply touched, my gentlemen, here so hospitably received
to be. From colleagues out of my own profession, in this from my own
home so far distant land. My heart is full of gratitude, but my poverty
of German words forces me to greater economy of expression. Excuse you,
my gentlemen, that I read off, what I you say will. [But he didn’t
read].</p>
<p>The German language speak I not good, but have numerous connoisseurs
me assured that I her write like an angel. Maybe–maybe–I know not. Have
till now no acquaintance with the angels had. That comes later–when it
the dear God please–it has no hurry.</p>
<p>Since long, my gentlemen, have I the passionate longing nursed a
speech on German to hold, but one has me not permitted. Men, who no
feeling for the art had, laid me ever hindrance in the way and made
naught my desire –sometimes by excuses, often by force. Always said
these men to me: “Keep you still, your Highness! Silence! For God’s sake
seek another way and means yourself obnoxious to make.“</p>
<p>In the present case, as usual it is me difficult become, for me the
permission to obtain. The committee sorrowed deeply, but could me the
permission not grant on account of a law which from the Concordia
demands she shall the German language protect. Du liebe Zeit! How so had
one to me this say could–might–dared–should? I am indeed the truest
friend of the German language–and not only now, but from long since–yes,
before twenty years already. And never have I the desire had the noble
language to hurt; to the contrary, only wished she to improve–I would
her only reform. It is the dream of my life been. I have already visits
by the various German governments paid and for contracts prayed. I am
now to Austria in the same task come. I would only some changes effect.
I would only the language method–the luxurious, elaborate construction
compress, the eternal parenthesis suppress, do away with, annihilate;
the introduction of more than thirteen subjects in one sentence forbid;
the verb so far to the front pull that one it without a telescope
discover can. With one word, my gentlemen, I would your beloved language
simplify so that, my gentlemen, when you her for prayer need, One her
yonder-up understands.</p>
<p>I beseech you, from me yourself counsel to let, execute these
mentioned reforms. Then will you an elegant language possess, and
afterward, when you some thing say will, will you at least yourself
understand what you said had. But often nowadays, when you a mile-long
sentence from you given and you yourself somewhat have rested, then must
you have a touching inquisitiveness have yourself to determine what you
actually spoken have. Before several days has the correspondent of a
local paper a sentence constructed which hundred and twelve words
contain, and therein were seven parentheses smuggled in, and the subject
seven times changed. Think you only, my gentlemen, in the course of the
voyage of a single sentence must the poor, persecuted, fatigued subject
seven times change position!</p>
<p>Now, when we the mentioned reforms execute, will it no longer so bad
be. Doch noch eins. I might gladly the separable verb also a little bit
reform. I might none do let what Schiller did: he has the whole history
of the Thirty Years’ War between the two members of a separable verb
in-pushed. That has even Germany itself aroused, and one has Schiller
the permission refused the History of the Hundred Years’ War to
compose–God be it thanked! After all these reforms established be will,
will the German language the noblest and the prettiest on the world
be.</p>
<p>Since to you now, my gentlemen, the character of my mission known is,
beseech I you so friendly to be and to me your valuable help grant.
Mr. Potzl has the public believed make would that I to Vienna come am in
order the bridges to clog up and the traffic to hinder, while I
observations gather and note. Allow you yourselves but not from him
deceived. My frequent presence on the bridges has an entirely innocent
ground. Yonder gives it the necessary space, yonder can one a noble long
German sentence elaborate, the bridge-railing along, and his whole
contents with one glance overlook. On the one end of the railing pasted
I the first member of a separable verb and the final member cleave I to
the other end–then spread the body of the sentence between it out!
Usually are for my purposes the bridges of the city long enough; when I
but Potzl’s writings study will I ride out and use the glorious endless
imperial bridge. But this is a calumny; Potzl writes the prettiest
German. Perhaps not so pliable as the mine, but in many details much
better. Excuse you these flatteries. These are well deserved.</p>
<p>Now I my speech execute–no, I would say I bring her to the close. I
am a foreigner–but here, under you, have I it entirely forgotten. And so
again and yet again proffer I you my heartiest thanks.</p>
<p>GERMAN FOR THE HUNGARIANS</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE JUBILEE CELEBRATION OF THE EMANCIPATION OF THE
HUNGARIAN PRESS, MARCH 26, 1899</p>
<p>The Ministry and members of Parliament were present. The subject was
the “Ausgleich“–i. e., the arrangement for the apportionment of the
taxes between Hungary and Austria. Paragraph 14 of the ausgleich fixes
the proportion each country must pay to the support of the army. It is
the paragraph which caused the trouble and prevented its renewal.</p>
<p>Now that we are all here together, I think it will be a good idea to
arrange the ausgleich. If you will act for Hungary I shall be quite
willing to act for Austria, and this is the very time for it. There
couldn’t be a better, for we are all feeling friendly, fair-minded, and
hospitable now, and, full of admiration for each other, full of
confidence in each other, full of the spirit of welcome, full of the
grace of forgiveness, and the disposition to let bygones be bygones.</p>
<p>Let us not waste this golden, this beneficent, this providential
opportunity. I am willing to make any concession you want, just so we
get it settled. I am not only willing to let grain come in free, I am
willing to pay the freight on it, and you may send delegates to the
Reichsrath if you like. All I require is that they shall be quiet,
peaceable people like your own deputies, and not disturb our
proceedings.</p>
<p>If you want the Gegenseitigengeldbeitragendenverhaltnismassigkeiten
rearranged and readjusted I am ready for that. I will let you off at
twenty-eight per cent.–twenty-seven–even twenty-five if you insist, for
there is nothing illiberal about me when I am out on a diplomatic
debauch.</p>
<p>Now, in return for these concessions, I am willing to take anything
in reason, and I think we may consider the business settled and the
ausgleich ausgegloschen at last for ten solid years, and we will sign
the papers in blank, and do it here and now.</p>
<p>Well, I am unspeakably glad to have that ausgleich off my hands. It
has kept me awake nights for anderthalbjahr.</p>
<p>But I never could settle it before, because always when I called at
the Foreign Office in Vienna to talk about it, there wasn’t anybody at
home, and that is not a place where you can go in and see for yourself
whether it is a mistake or not, because the person who takes care of the
front door there is of a size that discourages liberty of action and the
free spirit of investigation. To think the ausgleich is abgemacht at
last! It is a grand and beautiful consummation, and I am glad I
came.</p>
<p>The way I feel now I do honestly believe I would rather be just my
own humble self at this moment than paragraph 14.</p>
<p>A NEW GERMAN WORD</p>
<p>To aid a local charity Mr. Clemens appeared before a fashionable
audience in Vienna, March 10, 1899, reading his sketch “The Lucerne
Girl,“ and describing how he had been interviewed and ridiculed. He said
in part:</p>
<p>I have not sufficiently mastered German, to allow my using it with
impunity. My collection of fourteen-syllable German words is still
incomplete. But I have just added to that collection a jewel –a
veritable jewel. I found it in a telegram from Linz, and it contains
ninety-five letters:</p>

erganzungsrevisionsfund</p>
<p>If I could get a similar word engraved upon my tombstone I should
sleep beneath it in peace.</p>
<p>UNCONSCIOUS PLAGIARISM</p>
<p>DELIVERED AT THE DINNER GIVEN BY THE PUBLISHERS OF “THE ATLANTIC
MONTHLY“ TO OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, IN HONOR OF HIS SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY,
AUGUST 29, 1879</p>
<p>I would have travelled a much greater distance than I have come to
witness the paying of honors to Doctor Holmes; for my feeling toward him
has always been one of peculiar warmth. When one receives a letter from
a great man for the first time in his life, it is a large event to him,
as all of you know by your own experience. You never can receive letters
enough from famous men afterward to obliterate that one, or dim the
memory of the pleasant surprise it was, and the gratification it gave
you. Lapse of time cannot make it commonplace or cheap.</p>
<p>Well, the first great man who ever wrote me a letter was our guest
–Oliver Wendell Holmes. He was also the first great literary man I ever
stole anything from–and that is how I came to write to him and he to me.
When my first book was new, a friend of mine said to me, “The dedication
is very neat.“ Yes, I said, I thought it was. My friend said, “I always
admired it, even before I saw it in The Innocents Abroad.“ I naturally
said: “What do you mean? Where did you ever see it before?“ “Well, I saw
it first some years ago as Doctor Holmes’s dedication to his Songs in
Many Keys.“ Of course, my first impulse was to prepare this man’s
remains for burial, but upon reflection I said I would reprieve him for
a moment or two and give him a chance to prove his assertion if he
could: We stepped into a book-store, and he did prove it. I had really
stolen that dedication, almost word for word. I could not imagine how
this curious thing had happened; for I knew one thing–that a certain
amount of pride always goes along with a teaspoonful of brains, and that
this pride protects a man from deliberately stealing other people’s
ideas. That is what a teaspoonful of brains will do for a man–and
admirers had often told me I had nearly a basketful–though they were
rather reserved as to the size of the basket.</p>
<p>However, I thought the thing out, and solved the mystery. Two years
before, I had been laid up a couple of weeks in the Sandwich Islands,
and had read and re-read Doctor Holmes’s poems till my mental reservoir
was filled up with them to the brim. The dedication lay on the top, and
handy, so, by-and-by, I unconsciously stole it. Perhaps I unconsciously
stole the rest of the volume, too, for many people have told me that my
book was pretty poetical, in one way or another. Well, of course, I
wrote Doctor Holmes and told him I hadn’t meant to steal, and he wrote
back and said in the kindest way that it was all right and no harm done;
and added that he believed we all unconsciously worked over ideas
gathered in reading and hearing, imagining they were original with
ourselves. He stated a truth, and did it in such a pleasant way, and
salved over my sore spot so gently and so healingly, that I was rather
glad I had committed the crime, far the sake of the letter. I afterward
called on him and told him to make perfectly free with any ideas of mine
that struck him as being good protoplasm for poetry. He could see by
that that there wasn’t anything mean about me; so we got along right
from the start. I have not met Doctor Holmes many times since; and
lately he said–However, I am wandering wildly away from the one thing
which I got on my feet to do; that is, to make my compliments to you, my
fellow-teachers of the great public, and likewise to say that I am right
glad to see that Doctor Holmes is still in his prime and full of
generous life; and as age is not determined by years, but by trouble and
infirmities of mind and body, I hope it may be a very long time yet
before any one can truthfully say, “He is growing old.“</p>
<p>THE WEATHER</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY’S SEVENTY FIRST ANNUAL DINNER, NEW
YORK CITY</p>
<p>The next toast was: “The Oldest Inhabitant-The Weather of New
England.“</p>
<p>“Who can lose it and forget it? Who can have it and regret it? Be
interposer ’twixt us Twain.“ –Merchant of Venice.</p>
<p>I reverently believe that the Maker who made us all makes everything
in New England but the weather. I don’t know who makes that, but I think
it must be raw apprentices in the weather-clerk’s factory who experiment
and learn how, in New England, for board and clothes, and then are
promoted to make weather for countries that require a good article, and
will take their custom elsewhere if they don’t get it. There is a
sumptuous variety about the New England weather that compels the
stranger’s admiration–and regret. The weather is always doing something
there; always attending strictly to business; always getting up new
designs and trying them on the people to see how they will go. But it
gets through more business in spring than in any other season. In the
spring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds of
weather inside of four-and-twenty hours. It was I that made the fame and
fortune of that man that had that marvellous collection of weather on
exhibition at the Centennial, that so astounded the foreigners. He was
going to travel all over the world and get specimens from all the
climes. I said, “Don’t you do it; you come to New England on a favorable
spring day.“ I told him what we could do in the way of style, variety,
and quantity. Well, he came and he made his collection in four days. As
to variety, why, he confessed that he got hundreds of kinds of weather
that he had never heard of before. And as to quantity well, after he had
picked out and discarded all that was blemished in any way, he not only
had weather enough, but weather to spare; weather to hire out; weather
to sell; to deposit; weather to invest; weather to give to the poor. The
people of New England are by nature patient and forbearing, but there
are some things which they will not stand. Every year they kill a lot of
poets for writing about “Beautiful Spring.“ These are generally casual
visitors, who bring their notions of spring from somewhere else, and
cannot, of course, know how the natives feel about spring. And so the
first thing they know the opportunity to inquire how they feel has
permanently gone by. Old Probabilities has a mighty reputation for
accurate prophecy, and thoroughly well deserves it. You take up the
paper and observe how crisply and confidently he checks off what
to-day’s weather is going to be on the Pacific, down South, in the
Middle States, in the Wisconsin region. See him sail along in the joy
and pride of his power till he gets to New England, and then see his
tail drop. He doesn’t know what the weather is going to be in New
England. Well, he mulls over it, and by and-by he gets out something
about like this: Probably northeast to southwest winds, varying to the
southward and westward and eastward, and points between, high and low
barometer swapping around from place to place; probable areas of rain,
snow, hail, and drought, succeeded or preceded by earthquakes, with
thunder and lightning. Then he jots down his postscript from his
wandering mind, to cover accidents. “But it is possible that the
programme may be wholly changed in the mean time.“ Yes, one of the
brightest gems in the New England weather is the dazzling uncertainty of
it. There is only one thing certain about it: you are certain there is
going to be plenty of it–a perfect grand review; but you never can tell
which end of the procession is going to move first. You fix up for the
drought; you leave your umbrella in the house and sally out, and two to
one you get drowned. You make up your mind that the earthquake is due;
you stand from under, and take hold of something to steady yourself, and
the first thing you know you get struck by lightning. These are great
disappointments; but they can’t be helped. The lightning there is
peculiar; it is so convincing, that when it strikes a thing it doesn’t
leave enough of that thing behind for you to tell whether–Well, you’d
think it was something valuable, and a Congressman had been there. And
the thunder. When the thunder begins to merely tune up and scrape and
saw, and key up the instruments for the performance, strangers say,
“Why, what awful thunder you have here!“ But when the baton is raised
and the real concert begins, you’ll find that stranger down in the
cellar with his head in the ash-barrel. Now as to the size of the
weather in New England–lengthways, I mean. It is utterly disproportioned
to the size of that little country. Half the time, when it is packed as
full as it can stick, you will see that New England weather sticking out
beyond the edges and projecting around hundreds and hundreds of miles
over the neighboring States. She can’t hold a tenth part of her weather.
You can see cracks all about where she has strained herself trying to do
it. I could speak volumes about the inhuman perversity of the New
England weather, but I will give but a single specimen. I like to hear
rain on a tin roof. So I covered part of my roof with tin, with an eye
to that luxury. Well, sir, do you think it ever rains on that tin? No,
sir; skips it every time. Mind, in this speech I have been trying merely
to do honor to the New England weather–no language could do it justice.
But, after all, there is at least one or two things about that weather
(or, if you please, effects produced by it) which we residents would not
like to part with. If we hadn’t our bewitching autumn foliage, we should
still have to credit the weather with one feature which compensates for
all its bullying vagaries–the ice-storm: when a leafless tree is clothed
with ice from the bottom to the top–ice that is as bright and clear as
crystal; when every bough and twig is strung with ice-beads, frozen
dew-drops, and the whole tree sparkles cold and white, like the Shah of
Persia’s diamond plume. Then the wind waves the branches and the sun
comes out and turns all those myriads of beads and drops to prisms that
glow and burn and flash with all manner of colored fires, which change
and change again with inconceivable rapidity from blue to red, from red
to green, and green to gold–the tree becomes a spraying fountain, a very
explosion of dazzling jewels; and it stands there the acme, the climax,
the supremest possibility in art or nature, of bewildering,
intoxicating, intolerable magnificence. One cannot make the words too
strong.</p>
<p>THE BABIES</p>
<p>THE BABIES</p>
<p>DELIVERED AT THE BANQUET, IN CHICAGO, GIVEN BY THE ARMY OF THE
TENNESSEE TO THEIR FIRST COMMANDER, GENERAL U. S. GRANT, NOVEMBER,
1879</p>
<p>The fifteenth regular toast was “The Babies.–As they comfort us in
our sorrows, let us not forget them in our festivities.“</p>
<p>I like that. We have not all had the good fortune to be ladies. We
have not all been generals, or poets, or statesmen; but when the toast
works down to the babies, we stand on common ground. It is a shame that
for a thousand years the world’s banquets have utterly ignored the baby,
as if he didn’t amount to anything. If you will stop and think a
minute–if you will go back fifty or one hundred years to your early
married life and recontemplate your first baby–you will remember that he
amounted to a good deal, and even something over. You soldiers all know
that when that little fellow arrived at family headquarters you had to
hand in your resignation. He took entire command. You became his lackey,
his mere body-servant, and you had to stand around too. He was not a
commander who made allowances for time, distance, weather, or anything
else. You had to execute his order whether it was possible or not. And
there was only one form of marching in his manual of tactics, and that
was the double-quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence and
disrespect, and the bravest of you didn’t dare to say a word. You could
face the death-storm at Donelson and Vicksburg, and give back blow for
blow; but when he clawed your whiskers, and pulled your hair, and
twisted your nose, you had to take it. When the thunders of war were
sounding in your ears you set your faces toward the batteries, and
advanced with steady tread; but when he turned on the terrors of his war
whoop you advanced in the other direction, and mighty glad of the
chance, too. When he called for soothing-syrup, did you venture to throw
out any side-remarks about certain services being unbecoming an officer
and a gentleman? No. You got up and got it. When he ordered his pap
bottle and it was not warm, did you talk back? Not you. You went to work
and warmed it. You even descended so far in your menial office as to
take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to see if it was
right–three parts water to one of milk, a touch of sugar to modify the
colic, and a drop of peppermint to kill those immortal hiccoughs. I can
taste that stuff yet. And how many things you learned as you went along!
Sentimental young folks still take stock in that beautiful old saying
that when the baby smiles in his sleep, it is because the angels are
whispering to him. Very pretty, but too thin–simply wind on the stomach,
my friends. If the baby proposed to take a walk at his usual hour, two
o’clock in the morning, didn’t you rise up promptly and remark, with a
mental addition which would not improve a Sunday-school book much, that
that was the very thing you were about to propose yourself? Oh! you were
under good discipline, and as you went fluttering up and down the room
in your undress uniform, you not only prattled undignified baby-talk,
but even tuned up your martial voices and tried to sing! –Rock a-by Baby
in the Tree-top, for instance. What a spectacle far an Army of the
Tennessee! And what an affliction for the neighbors, too; for it is not
everybody within, a mile around that likes military music at three in
the morning. And, when you had been keeping this sort of thing up two or
three hours, and your little velvet head intimated that nothing suited
him like exercise and noise, what did you do? You simply went on until
you dropped in the last ditch. The idea that a baby doesn’t amount to
anything! Why, one baby is just a house and a front yard full by itself.
One baby can, furnish more business than you and your whole Interior
Department can attend to. He is enterprising, irrepressible, brimful of
lawless activities. Do what you please, you can’t make him stay on the
reservation. Sufficient unto the day is one baby. As long as you are in
your right mind don’t you ever pray for twins. Twins amount to a
permanent riot. And there ain’t any real difference between triplets and
an insurrection.</p>
<p>Yes, it was high time for a toast-master to recognize the importance
of the babies. Think what is in store for the present crop! Fifty years
from now we shall all be dead, I trust, and then this flag, if it still
survive (and let us hope it may), will be floating over a Republic
numbering 200,000,000 souls, according to the settled laws of our
increase. Our present schooner of State will have grown into a political
leviathan–a Great Eastern. The cradled babies of to-day will be on deck.
Let them be well trained, for we are going to leave a big contract on
their hands. Among the three or four million cradles now rocking in the
land are some which this nation would preserve for ages as sacred
things, if we could know which ones they are. In one of these cradles
the unconscious Farragut of the future is at this moment teething think
of it! and putting in a world of dead earnest, unarticulated, but
perfectly justifiable profanity over it, too. In another the future
renowned astronomer is blinking at the shining Milky Way with but a
languid interest poor little chap!–and wondering what has become of that
other one they call the wet-nurse. In another the future great historian
is lying–and doubtless will continue to lie until his earthly mission is
ended. In another the future President is busying himself with no
profounder problem of state than what the mischief has become of his
hair so early; and in a mighty array of other cradles there are now some
60,000 future office-seekers, getting ready to furnish him occasion to
grapple with that same old problem a second, time. And in still one more
cradle, some where under the flag, the future illustrious
commander-in-chief of the American armies is so little burdened with his
approaching grandeurs and responsibilities as to be giving his whole
strategic mind at this moment to trying to find out some way to get his
big toe into his mouth–an achievement which, meaning no disrespect, the
illustrious guest of this evening turned his entire attention to some
fifty-six years ago; and if the child is but a prophecy of the man,
there are mighty few who will doubt that he succeeded.</p>
<p>OUR CHILDREN AND GREAT DISCOVERIES</p>
<p>DELIVERED AT THE AUTHORS’ CLUB, NEW YORK</p>
<p>Our children–yours–and–mine. They seem like little things to talk
about–our children, but little things often make up the sum of human
life–that’s a good sentence. I repeat it, little things often produce
great things. Now, to illustrate, take Sir Isaac Newton–I presume some
of you have heard of Mr. Newton. Well, once when Sir Isaac Newton –a
mere lad–got over into the man’s apple orchard–I don’t know what he was
doing there–I didn’t come all the way from Hartford to q-u-e-s-t-i-o-n
Mr. Newton’s honesty–but when he was there–in the main orchard–he saw an
apple fall and he was a-t-t-racted toward it, and that led to the
discovery–not of Mr. Newton but of the great law of attraction and
gravitation.</p>
<p>And there was once another great discoverer–I’ve forgotten his name,
and I don’t remember what he discovered, but I know it was something
very important, and I hope you will all tell your children about it when
you get home. Well, when the great discoverer was once loafn’ around
down in Virginia, and a-puttin’ in his time flirting with Pocahontas–oh!
Captain John Smith, that was the man’s name–and while he and Poca were
sitting in Mr. Powhatan’s garden, he accidentally put his arm around her
and picked something simple weed, which proved to be tobacco–and now we
find it in every Christian family, shedding its civilizing influence
broadcast throughout the whole religious community.</p>
<p>Now there was another great man, I can’t think of his name either,
who used to loaf around and watch the great chandelier in the cathedral
at Pisa., which set him to thinking about the great law of gunpowder,
and eventually led to the discovery of the cotton-gin.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t say this as an inducement for our young men to loaf
around like Mr. Newton and Mr. Galileo and Captain Smith, but they were
once little babies two days old, and they show what little things have
sometimes accomplished.</p>
<p>EDUCATING THEATRE-GOERS</p>
<p>The children of the Educational Alliance gave a performance of “The
Prince and the Pauper“ on the afternoon of April 14, 1907, in the
theatre of the Alliance Building in East Broadway. The audience was
composed of nearly one thousand children of the neighborhood.
Mr. Clemens, Mr. Howells, and Mr. Daniel Frohman were among the invited
guests.</p>
<p>I have not enjoyed a play so much, so heartily, and so thoroughly
since I played Miles Hendon twenty-two years ago. I used to play in this
piece (“The Prince and the Pauper“) with my children, who, twenty-two
years ago, were little youngsters. One of my daughters was the Prince,
and a neighbor’s daughter was the Pauper, and the children of other
neighbors played other parts. But we never gave such a performance as we
have seen here to-day. It would have been beyond us.</p>
<p>My late wife was the dramatist and stage-manager. Our coachman was
the stage-manager, second in command. We used to play it in this simple
way, and the one who used to bring in the crown on a cushion–he was a
little fellow then–is now a clergyman way up high–six or seven feet
high–and growing higher all the time. We played it well, but not as well
as you see it here, for you see it done by practically trained
professionals.</p>
<p>I was especially interested in the scene which we have just had, for
Miles Hendon was my part. I did it as well as a person could who never
remembered his part. The children all knew their parts. They did not
mind if I did not know mine. I could thread a needle nearly as well as
the player did whom you saw to-day. The words of my part I could supply
on the spot. The words of the song that Miles Hendon sang here I did not
catch. But I was great in that song.</p>
<p>[Then Mr. Clemens hummed a bit of doggerel that the reporter made out
as this:</p>
<p>“There was a woman in her town, She loved her husband well, But
another man just twice as well.“</p>
<p>“How is that?“ demanded Mr. Clemens. Then resuming]</p>
<p>It was so fresh and enjoyable to make up a new set of words each time
that I played the part.</p>
<p>If I had a thousand citizens in front of me, I would like to give
them information, but you children already know all that I have found
out about the Educational Alliance. It’s like a man living within thirty
miles of Vesuvius and never knowing about a volcano. It’s like living
for a lifetime in Buffalo, eighteen miles from Niagara, and never going
to see the Falls. So I had lived in New York and knew nothing about the
Educational Alliance.</p>
<p>This theatre is a part of the work, and furnishes pure and clean
plays. This theatre is an influence. Everything in the world is
accomplished by influences which train and educate. When you get to be
seventy-one and a half, as I am, you may think that your education is
over, but it isn’t.</p>
<p>If we had forty theatres of this kind in this city of four millions,
how they would educate and elevate! We should have a body of educated
theatre-goers.</p>
<p>It would make better citizens, honest citizens. One of the best gifts
a millionaire could make would be a theatre here and a theatre there. It
would make of you a real Republic, and bring about an educational
level.</p>
<p>THE EDUCATIONAL THEATRE</p>
<p>On November 19, 1907, Mr. Clemens entertained a party of six or seven
hundred of his friends, inviting them to witness the representation of
“The Prince and the Pauper,“ flayed by boys and girls of the East Side
at the Children’s Educational Theatre, New York.</p>
<p>Just a word or two to let you know how deeply I appreciate the honor
which the children who are the actors and frequenters of this cozy
playhouse have conferred upon me. They have asked me to be their
ambassador to invite the hearts and brains of New York to come down here
and see the work they are doing. I consider it a grand distinction to be
chosen as their intermediary. Between the children and myself there is
an indissoluble bond of friendship.</p>
<p>I am proud of this theatre and this performance–proud, because I am
naturally vain–vain of myself and proud of the children.</p>
<p>I wish we could reach more children at one time. I am glad to see
that the children of the East Side have turned their backs on the Bowery
theatres to come to see the pure entertainments presented here.</p>
<p>This Children’s Theatre is a great educational institution. I hope
the time will come when it will be part of every public school in the
land. I may be pardoned in being vain. I was born vain, I guess. [At
this point the stage-manager’s whistle interrupted Mr. Clemens.] That
settles it; there’s my cue to stop. I was to talk until the whistle
blew, but it blew before I got started. It takes me longer to get
started than most people. I guess I was born at slow speed. My time is
up, and if you’ll keep quiet for two minutes I’ll tell you something
about Miss Herts, the woman who conceived this splendid idea. She is the
originator and the creator of this theatre. Educationally, this
institution coins the gold of young hearts into external good.</p>
<p>[On April 23, 1908, he spoke again at the same place]</p>
<p>I will be strictly honest with you; I am only fit to be honorary
president. It is not to be expected that I should be useful as a real
president. But when it comes to things ornamental I, of course, have no
objection. There is, of course, no competition. I take it as a very real
compliment because there are thousands of children who have had a part
in this request. It is promotion in truth.</p>
<p>It is a thing worth doing that is done here. You have seen the
children play. You saw how little Sally reformed her burglar. She could
reform any burglar. She could reform me. This is the only school in
which can be taught the highest and most difficult lessons–morals. In
other schools the way of teaching morals is revolting. Here the children
who come in thousands live through each part.</p>
<p>They are terribly anxious for the villain to get his bullet, and that
I take to be a humane and proper sentiment. They spend freely the ten
cents that is not saved without a struggle. It comes out of the candy
money, and the money that goes for chewing-gum and other necessaries of
life. They make the sacrifice freely. This is the only school which they
are sorry to leave.</p>
<p>POETS AS POLICEMEN</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens was one of the speakers at the Lotos Club dinner to
Governor Odell, March 24, 1900. The police problem was referred to at
length.</p>
<p>Let us abolish policemen who carry clubs and revolvers, and put in a
squad of poets armed to the teeth with poems on Spring and Love. I would
be very glad to serve as commissioner, not because I think I am
especially qualified, but because I am too tired to work and would like
to take a rest.</p>
<p>Howells would go well as my deputy. He is tired too, and needs a rest
badly.</p>
<p>I would start in at once to elevate, purify, and depopulate the
red-light district. I would assign the most soulful poets to that
district, all heavily armed with their poems. Take Chauncey Depew as a
sample. I would station them on the corners after they had rounded up
all the depraved people of the district so they could not escape, and
then have them read from their poems to the poor unfortunates. The plan
would be very effective in causing an emigration of the depraved
element.</p>
<p>PUDD’NHEAD WILSON DRAMATIZED</p>
<p>When Mr. Clemens arrived from Europe in 1895 one of the first things
he did was to see the dramatization of Pudd’nhead Wilson. The audience
becoming aware of the fact that Mr. Clemens was in the house called upon
him for a speech.</p>
<p>Never in my life have I been able to make a speech without
preparation, and I assure you that this position in which I find myself
is one totally unexpected.</p>
<p>I have been hemmed in all day by William Dean Howells and other
frivolous persons, and I have been talking about everything in the world
except that of which speeches are constructed. Then, too, seven days on
the water is not conducive to speech-making. I will only say that I
congratulate Mr. Mayhew; he has certainly made a delightful play out of
my rubbish. His is a charming gift. Confidentially I have always had an
idea that I was well equipped to write plays, but I have never
encountered a manager who has agreed with me.</p>
<p>DALY THEATRE</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT A DINNER AFTER THE ONE HUNDREDTH PERFORMANCE OF “THE
TAMING OF THE SHREW.“</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens made the following speech, which he incorporated
afterward in Following the Equator.</p>
<p>I am glad to be here. This is the hardest theatre in New York to get
into, even at the front door. I never, got in without hard work. I am
glad we have got so far in at last. Two or three years ago I had an
appointment to meet Mr. Daly on the stage of this theatre at eight
o’clock in the evening. Well, I got on a train at Hartford to come to
New York and keep the appointment. All I had to do was to come to the
back door of the theatre on Sixth Avenue. I did not believe that; I did
not believe it could be on Sixth Avenue, but that is what Daly’s note
said–come to that door, walk right in, and keep the appointment. It
looked very easy. It looked easy enough, but I had not much confidence
in the Sixth Avenue door.</p>
<p>Well, I was kind of bored on the train, and I bought some
newspapers–New Haven newspapers–and there was not much news in them, so
I read the advertisements. There was one advertisement of a bench-show.
I had heard of bench-shows, and I often wondered what there was about
them to interest people. I had seen bench-shows–lectured to bench-shows,
in fact–but I didn’t want to advertise them or to brag about them. Well,
I read on a little, and learned that a bench-show was not a bench-show
–but dogs, not benches at all–only dogs. I began to be interested, and
as there was nothing else to do I read every bit of the advertisement,
and learned that the biggest thing in this show was a St. Bernard dog
that weighed one hundred and forty-five pounds. Before I got to New York
I was so interested in the bench-shows that I made up my mind to go to
one the first chance I got. Down on Sixth Avenue, near where that back
door might be, I began to take things leisurely. I did not like to be in
too much of a hurry. There was not anything in sight that looked like a
back door. The nearest approach to it was a cigar store. So I went in
and bought a cigar, not too expensive, but it cost enough to pay for any
information I might get and leave the dealer a fair profit. Well, I did
not like to be too abrupt, to make the man think me crazy, by asking him
if that was the way to Daly’s Theatre, so I started gradually to lead up
to the subject, asking him first if that was the way to Castle Garden.
When I got to the real question, and he said he would show me the way, I
was astonished. He sent me through a long hallway, and I found myself in
a back yard. Then I went through a long passageway and into a little
room, and there before my eyes was a big St. Bernard dog lying on a
bench. There was another door beyond and I went there, and was met by a
big, fierce man with a fur cap on and coat off, who remarked, “Phwat do
yez want?“ I told him I wanted to see Mr. Daly. “Yez can’t see Mr. Daly
this time of night,“ he responded. I urged that I had an appointment
with Mr. Daly, and gave him my card, which did not seem to impress him
much. “Yez can’t get in and yez can’t shmoke here. Throw away that
cigar. If yez want to see Mr. Daly, yez ‘ll have to be after going to
the front door and buy a ticket, and then if yez have luck and he’s
around that way yez may see him.“ I was getting discouraged, but I had
one resource left that had been of good service in similar emergencies.
Firmly but kindly I told him my name was Mark Twain, and I awaited
results. There was none. He was not fazed a bit. “Phwere’s your order to
see Mr. Daly?“ he asked. I handed him the note, and he examined it
intently. “My friend,“ I remarked, “you can read that better if you hold
it the other side up.“ But he took no notice of the suggestion, and
finally asked: “Where’s Mr. Daly’s name?“ “There it is,“ I told him, “on
the top of the page.“ “That’s all right,“ he said, “that’s where he
always puts it; but I don’t see the ’W’ in his name,“ and he eyed me
distrustfully. Finally, he asked, “Phwat do yez want to see Mr. Daly
for?“ “Business.“ “Business?“ “Yes.“ It was my only hope. “Phwat
kind–theatres?“ that was too much. “No.“ “What kind of shows, then?“
“Bench-shows.“ It was risky, but I was desperate.“ Bench–shows, is
it–where?“ The big man’s face changed, and he began to look interested.
“New Haven.“ “New Haven, it is? Ah, that’s going to be a fine show. I’m
glad to see you. Did you see a big dog in the other room?“ “Yes.“ “How
much do you think that dog weighs?“ “One hundred and forty-five pounds.“
“Look at that, now! He’s a good judge of dogs, and no mistake. He weighs
all of one hundred and thirty-eight. Sit down and shmoke–go on and
shmoke your cigar, I’ll tell Mr. Daly you are here.“ In a few minutes I
was on the stage shaking hands with Mr. Daly, and the big man standing
around glowing with satisfaction. “Come around in front,“ said Mr. Daly,
“and see the performance. I will put you into my own box.“ And as I
moved away I heard my honest friend mutter, “Well, he desarves it.“</p>
<p>THE DRESS OF CIVILIZED WOMAN</p>
<p>A large part of the daughter of civilization is her dress–as it
should be. Some civilized women would lose half their charm without
dress, and some would lose all of it. The daughter Of modern
civilization dressed at her utmost best is a marvel of exquisite and
beautiful art and expense. All the lands, all the climes, and all the
arts are laid under tribute to furnish her forth. Her linen is from
Belfast, her robe is from Paris, her lace is from Venice, or Spain, or
France, her feathers are from the remote regions of Southern Africa, her
furs from the remoter region of the iceberg and the aurora, her fan from
Japan, her diamonds from Brazil, her bracelets from California, her
pearls from Ceylon, her cameos from Rome. She has gems and trinkets from
buried Pompeii, and others that graced comely Egyptian forms that have
been dust and ashes now for forty centuries. Her watch is from Geneva,
her card case is from China, her hair is from–from–I don’t know where
her hair is from; I never could find out; that is, her other hair–her
public hair, her Sunday hair; I don’t mean the hair she goes to bed
with.</p>
<p>And that reminds me of a trifle. Any time you want to you can glance
around the carpet of a Pullman car, and go and pick up a hair-pin; but
not to save your life can you get any woman in that car to acknowledge
that hair-pin. Now, isn’t that strange? But it’s true. The woman who has
never swerved from cast-iron veracity and fidelity in her whole life
will, when confronted with this crucial test, deny her hair-pin. She
will deny that hair-pin before a hundred witnesses. I have stupidly got
into more trouble and more hot water trying to hunt up the owner of a
hair-pin in a Pullman than by any other indiscretion of my life.</p>
<p>DRESS REFORM AND COPYRIGHT</p>
<p>When the present copyright law was under discussion, Mr. Clemens
appeared before the committee. He had sent Speaker Cannon the following
letter:</p>
<p>“DEAR UNCLE JOSEPH,–Please get me the thanks of Congress, not next
week but right away. It is very necessary. Do accomplish this for your
affectionate old friend right away–by, persuasion if you can, by
violence if you must, for it is imperatively necessary that I get on the
floor of the House for two or three hours and talk to the members, man
by man, in behalf of support; encouragement, and protection of one of
the nation’s most valuable assets and industries–its literature. I have
arguments with me–also a barrel with liquid in it.</p>
<p>“Give me a chance. Get me the thanks of Congress. Don’t wait for
others–there isn’t time; furnish them to me yourself and let Congress
ratify later. I have stayed away and let Congress alone for seventy-one
years and am entitled to the thanks. Congress knows this perfectly well,
and I have long felt hurt that this quite proper and earned expression
of gratitude has been merely felt by the House and never publicly
uttered.</p>
<p>“Send me an order on the sergeant-at-arms quick. When shall I come?
“With love and a benediction, “MARK TWAIN.“</p>
<p>While waiting to appear before the committee, My. Clemens talked to
the reporters:</p>
<p>Why don’t you ask why I am wearing such apparently unseasonable
clothes? I’ll tell you. I have found that when a man reaches the
advanced age of seventy-one years, as I have, the continual sight of
dark clothing is likely to have a depressing effect upon him.
Light-colored clothing is more pleasing to the eye and enlivens the
spirit. Now, of course, I cannot compel every one to wear such clothing
just for my especial benefit, so I do the next best thing and wear it
myself.</p>
<p>Of course, before a man reaches my years the fear of criticism might
prevent him from indulging his fancy. I am not afraid of that. I am
decidedly for pleasing color combinations in dress. I like to see the
women’s clothes, say, at the opera. What can be more depressing than the
sombre black which custom requires men to wear upon state occasions? A
group of men in evening clothes looks like a flock of crows, and is just
about as inspiring.</p>
<p>After all, what is the purpose of clothing? Are not clothes intended
primarily to preserve dignity and also to afford comfort to their
wearer? Now I know of nothing more uncomfortable than the present-day
clothes of men. The finest clothing made is a person’s own skin, but, of
course, society demands something more than this.</p>
<p>The best-dressed man I have ever seen, however, was a native of the
Sandwich Islands who attracted my attention thirty years ago. Now, when
that man wanted to don especial dress to honor a public occasion or a
holiday, why, he occasionally put on a pair of spectacles. Otherwise the
clothing with which God had provided him sufficed.</p>
<p>Of course, I have ideas of dress reform. For one thing, why not adopt
some of the women’s styles? Goodness knows, they adopt enough of ours.
Take the peek-a-boo waist, for instance. It has the obvious advantages
of being cool and comfortable, and in addition it is almost always made
up in pleasing colors which cheer and do not depress.</p>
<p>It is true that I dressed the Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur’s
Court in a plug-hat, but, let’s see, that was twenty-five years ago.
Then no man was considered fully dressed until he donned a plug-hat.
Nowadays I think that no man is dressed until he leaves it home. Why,
when I left home yesterday they trotted out a plug-hat for me to
wear.</p>
<p>“You must wear it,“ they told me; “why, just think of going to
Washington without a plug-hat!“ But I said no; I would wear a derby or
nothing. Why, I believe I could walk along the streets of New York–I
never do –but still I think I could–and I should never see a
well-dressed man wearing a plug-hat. If I did I should suspect him of
something. I don’t know just what, but I would suspect him.</p>
<p>Why, when I got up on the second story of that Pennsylvania
ferry-boat coming down here yesterday I saw Howells coming along. He was
the only man on the boat with a plug-hat, and I tell you he felt ashamed
of himself. He said he had been persuaded to wear it against his better
sense. But just think of a man nearly seventy years old who has not a
mind of his own on such matters!</p>
<p>“Are you doing any work now?“ the youngest and most serious reporter
asked.</p>
<p>Work? I retired from work on my seventieth birthday. Since then I
have been putting in merely twenty-six hours a day dictating my
autobiography, which, as John Phoenix said in regard to his autograph,
may be relied upon as authentic, as it is written exclusively by me. But
it is not to be published in full until I am thoroughly dead. I have
made it as caustic, fiendish, and devilish as possible. It will fill
many volumes, and I shall continue writing it until the time comes for
me to join the angels. It is going to be a terrible autobiography. It
will make the hair of some folks curl. But it cannot be published until
I am dead, and the persons mentioned in it and their children and
grandchildren are dead. It is something awful!</p>
<p>“Can you tell us the names of some of the notables that are here to
see you off?“</p>
<p>I don’t know. I am so shy. My shyness takes a peculiar phase. I never
look a person in the face. The reason is that I am afraid they may know
me and that I may not know them, which makes it very embarrassing for
both of us. I always wait for the other person to speak. I know lots of
people, but I don’t know who they are. It is all a matter of ability to
observe things. I never observe anything now. I gave up the habit years
ago. You should keep a habit up if you want to become proficient in it.
For instance, I was a pilot once, but I gave it up, and I do not believe
the captain of the Minneapolis would let me navigate his ship to London.
Still, if I think that he is not on the job I may go up on the bridge
and offer him a few suggestions.</p>
