Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</h4>
<p>FAYAL (Azores,) June 20th, 1867. DEAR FOLKS,–We are having a lively
time here, after a stormy trip. We meant to go to San Miguel, but were
driven here by stress of weather. Beautiful climate. Yrs. Affect.
SAM.</p>
<p>GIBRALTAR, June 30th, 1867. DEAR FOLKS,–Arrived here this morning,
and am clear worn out with riding and climbing in and over and around
this monstrous rock and its fortifications. Summer climate and very
pleasant. Yrs. SAM.</p>
<p>TANGIER, MOROCCO, (AFRICA), July 1, 1867. DEAR FOLKS, Half a dozen of
us came here yesterday from Gibraltar and some of the company took the
other direction; went up through Spain, to Paris by rail. We decided
that Gibraltar and San Roque were all of Spain that we wanted to see at
present and are glad we came here among the Africans, Moors, Arabs and
Bedouins of the desert. I would not give this experience for all the
balance of the trip combined. This is the infernalest hive of infernally
costumed barbarians I have ever come across yet. Yrs. SAM.</p>
<p>AT SEA, July 2, 1867. DR. FOLKS,–We are far up the intensely blue and
ravishingly beautiful Mediterranean. And now we are just passing the
island of Minorca. The climate is perfectly lovely and it is hard to
drive anybody to bed, day or night. We remain up the whole night through
occasionally, and by this means enjoy the rare sensation of seeing the
sun rise. But the sunsets are soft, rich, warm and superb!</p>
<p>We had a ball last night under the awnings of the quarter deck, and
the share of it of three of us was masquerade. We had full, flowing,
picturesque Moorish costumes which we purchased in the bazaars of
Tangier. Yrs. SAM.</p>
<p>MARSEILLES, FRANCE, July 5, 1867. We are here. Start for Paris
tomorrow. All well. Had gorgeous 4th of July jollification yesterday at
sea. Yrs. SAM.</p>
<p>The reader may expand these sketchy outlines to his heart’s content
by following the chapters in The Innocents Abroad, which is very good
history, less elaborated than might be supposed. But on the other hand,
the next letter adds something of interest to the book-circumstances
which a modest author would necessarily omit.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>YALTA, RUSSIA, Aug. 25, 1867. DEAR FOLKS,–We have been representing
the United States all we knew how today. We went to Sebastopol, after we
got tired of Constantinople (got your letter there, and one at Naples,)
and there the Commandant and the whole town came aboard and were as
jolly and sociable as old friends. They said the Emperor of Russia was
at Yalta, 30 miles or 40 away, and urged us to go there with the ship
and visit him–promised us a cordial welcome. They insisted on sending a
telegram to the Emperor, and also a courier overland to announce our
coming. But we knew that a great English Excursion party, and also the
Viceroy of Egypt, in his splendid yacht, had been refused an audience
within the last fortnight, so we thought it not safe to try it. They
said, no difference–the Emperor would hardly visit our ship, because
that would be a most extraordinary favor, and one which he uniformly
refuses to accord under any circumstances, but he would certainly
receive us at his palace. We still declined. But we had to go to Odessa,
250 miles away, and there the Governor General urged us, and sent a
telegram to the Emperor, which we hardly expected to be answered, but it
was, and promptly. So we sailed back to Yalta.</p>
<p>We all went to the palace at noon, today, (3 miles) in carriages and
on horses sent by the Emperor, and we had a jolly time. Instead of the
usual formal audience of 15 minutes, we staid 4 hours and were made a
good deal more at home than we could have been in a New York
drawing-room. The whole tribe turned out to receive our party-Emperor,
Empress, the oldest daughter (Grand-Duchess Marie, a pretty girl of 14,)
a little Grand Duke, her brother, and a platoon of Admirals, Princes,
Peers of the Empire, etc., and in a little while an aid-de-camp arrived
with a request from the Grand Duke Michael, the Emperor’s brother, that
we would visit his palace and breakfast with him. The Emperor also
invited us, on behalf of his absent eldest son and heir (aged 22,) to
visit his palace and consider it a visit to him. They all talk English
and they were all very neatly but very plainly dressed. You all dress a
good deal finer than they were dressed. The Emperor and his family threw
off all reserve and showed us all over the palace themselves. It is very
rich and very elegant, but in no way gaudy.</p>
<p>I had been appointed chairman of a committee to draught an address to
the Emperor in behalf of the passengers, and as I fully expected, and as
they fully intended, I had to write the address myself. I didn’t mind
it, because I have no modesty and would as soon write to an Emperor as
to anybody else–but considering that there were 5 on the committee I
thought they might have contributed one paragraph among them, anyway.
They wanted me to read it to him, too, but I declined that honor–not
because I hadn’t cheek enough (and some to spare,) but because our
Consul at Odessa was along, and also the Secretary of our Legation at
St. Petersburgh, and of course one of those ought to read it. The
Emperor accepted the address–it was his business to do it–and so many
others have praised it warmly that I begin to imagine it must be a
wonderful sort of document and herewith send you the original draught of
it to be put into alcohol and preserved forever like a curious
reptile.</p>
<p>They live right well at the Grand Duke Michael’s their breakfasts are
not gorgeous but very excellent–and if Mike were to say the word I would
go there and breakfast with him tomorrow. Yrs aff SAM.</p>
<p>P. S. [Written across the face of the last page.] They had told us it
would be polite to invite the Emperor to visit the ship, though he would
not be likely to do it. But he didn’t give us a chance–he has requested
permission to come on board with his family and all his relations
tomorrow and take a sail, in case it is calm weather. I can, entertain
them. My hand is in, now, and if you want any more Emperors feted in
style, trot them out.</p>
<p>The next letter is of interest in that it gives us the program and
volume of his work. With all the sight seeing he was averaging a full
four letters a week–long letters, requiring careful observation and
inquiry. How fresh and impressionable and full of vigor he was, even in
that fierce southern heat! No one makes the Mediterranean trip in summer
to-day, and the thought of adding constant letter-writing to steady
travel through southern France, Italy, Greece, and Turkey in blazing
midsummer is stupefying. And Syria and Egypt in September!</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>CONSTANTINOPLE, Sept. 1, ’67.</p>
<p>DEAR FOLKS,–All well. Do the Alta’s come regularly? I wish I knew
whether my letters reach them or not. Look over the back papers and see.
I wrote them as follows: 1 Letter from Fayal, in the Azores Islands. 1
from Gibraltar, in Spain. 1 from Tangier, in Africa. 2 from Paris and
Marseilles, in France. 1 from Genoa, in Italy. 1 from Milan. 1 from Lake
Como. 1 from some little place in Switzerland–have forgotten the name. 4
concerning Lecce, Bergamo, Padua, Verona, Battlefield of Marengo,
Pestachio, and some other cities in Northern Italy. 2 from Venice. 1
about Bologna. 1 from Florence. 1 from Pisa. 1 from Leghorn. 1 from Rome
and Civita Vecchia. 2 from Naples. 1 about Pazzuoli, where St. Paul
landed, the Baths of Nero, and the ruins of Baia, Virgil’s tomb, the
Elysian Fields, the Sunken Cities and the spot where Ulysses landed. 1
from Herculaneum and Vesuvius. 1 from Pompeii. 1 from the Island of
Ischia. 1 concerning the Volcano of Stromboli, the city and Straits of
Messina, the land of Sicily, Scylla and Charybdis etc. 1 about the
Grecian Archipelago. 1 about a midnight visit to Athens, the Piraeus and
the ruins of the Acropolis. 1 about the Hellespont, the site of ancient
Troy, the Sea of Marmara, etc. 2 about Constantinople, the Golden Horn
and the beauties of the Bosphorus. 1 from Odessa and Sebastopol in
Russia, the Black Sea, etc. 2 from Yalta, Russia, concerning a visit to
the Czar. And yesterday I wrote another letter from Constantinople and 1
today about its neighbor in Asia, Scatter. I am not done with Turkey
yet. Shall write 2 or 3 more.</p>
<p>I have written to the New York Herald 2 letters from Naples, (no name
signed,) and 1 from Constantinople.</p>
<p>To the New York Tribune I have written 1 from Fayal. 1 from Civita
Vecchia in the Roman States. 2 from Yalta, Russia. And 1 from
Constantinople.</p>
<p>I have never seen any of these letters in print except the one to the
Tribune from Fayal and that was not worth printing.</p>
<p>We sail hence tomorrow, perhaps, and my next letters will be mailed
at Smyrna, in Syria. I hope to write from the Sea of Tiberius, Damascus,
Jerusalem, Joppa, and possibly other points in the Holy Land. The
letters from Egypt, the Nile and Algiers I will look out for, myself. I
will bring them in my pocket.</p>
<p>They take the finest photographs in the world here. I have ordered
some. They will be sent to Alexandria, Egypt.</p>
<p>You cannot conceive of anything so beautiful as Constantinople,
viewed from the Golden Horn or the Bosphorus. I think it must be the
handsomest city in the world. I will go on deck and look at it for you,
directly. I am staying in the ship, tonight. I generally stay on shore
when we are in port. But yesterday I just ran myself down. Dan Slote, my
room-mate, is on shore. He remained here while we went up the Black Sea,
but it seems he has not got enough of it yet. I thought Dan had got the
state-room pretty full of rubbish at last, but a while ago his dragoman
arrived with a bran new, ghastly tomb-stone of the Oriental pattern,
with his name handsomely carved and gilded on it, in Turkish characters.
That fellow will buy a Circassian slave, next.</p>
<p>I am tired. We are going on a trip, tomorrow. I must to bed. Love to
all. Yrs SAM.</p>
<p>U. S. CONSUL’S OFFICE, BEIRUT, SYRIA, Sept. 11. (1867) DEAR FOLKS,–We
are here, eight of us, making a contract with a dragoman to take us to
Baalbek, then to Damascus, Nazareth, andandandandc. then to Lake
Genassareth (Sea of Tiberias,) then South through all the celebrated
Scriptural localities to Jerusalem–then to the Dead Sea, the Cave of
Macpelah and up to Joppa where the ship will be. We shall be in the
saddle three weeks–we have horses, tents, provisions, arms, a dragoman
and two other servants, and we pay five dollars a day apiece, in gold.
Love to all, yrs. SAM.</p>
<p>We leave tonight, at two o’clock in the morning.</p>
<p>There appear to be no further home letters written from Syria–and
none from Egypt. Perhaps with the desert and the delta the heat at last
became too fearful for anything beyond the actual requirements of the
day. When he began his next it was October, and the fiercer travel was
behind him.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>CAGHARI, SARDINIA, Oct, 12, 1867. DEAR FOLKS,–We have just dropped
anchor before this handsome city and–</p>
<p>ALGIERS, AFRICA, Oct. 15. They would not let us land at Caghari on
account of cholera. Nothing to write.</p>
<p>MALAGA, SPAIN, Oct. 17. The Captain and I are ashore here under
guard, waiting to know whether they will let the ship anchor or not.
Quarantine regulations are very strict here on all vessels coming from
Egypt. I am a little anxious because I want to go inland to Granada and
see the Alhambra. I can go on down by Seville and Cordova, and be picked
up at Cadiz.</p>
<p>Later: We cannot anchor–must go on. We shall be at Gibraltar before
midnight and I think I will go horseback (a long days) and thence by
rail and diligence to Cadiz. I will not mail this till I see the
Gibraltar lights–I begin to think they won’t let us in anywhere.</p>
<p>11.30 P. M.–Gibraltar. At anchor and all right, but they won’t let us
land till morning–it is a waste of valuable time. We shall reach New
York middle of November. Yours, SAM.</p>
<p>CADIZ, Oct 24, 1867. DEAR FOLKS,–We left Gibraltar at noon and rode
to Algeciras, (4 hours) thus dodging the quarantine, took dinner and
then rode horseback all night in a swinging trot and at daylight took a
caleche (a wheeled vehicle) and rode 5 hours–then took cars and traveled
till twelve at night. That landed us at Seville and we were over the
hard part of our trip, and somewhat tired. Since then we have taken
things comparatively easy, drifting around from one town to another and
attracting a good deal of attention, for I guess strangers do not wander
through Andalusia and the other Southern provinces of Spain often. The
country is precisely as it was when Don Quixote and Sancho Panza were
possible characters.</p>
<p>But I see now what the glory of Spain must have been when it was
under Moorish domination. No, I will not say that, but then when one is
carried away, infatuated, entranced, with the wonders of the Alhambra
and the supernatural beauty of the Alcazar, he is apt to overflow with
admiration for the splendid intellects that created them.</p>
<p>I cannot write now. I am only dropping a line to let you know I am
well. The ship will call for us here tomorrow. We may stop at Lisbon,
and shall at the Bermudas, and will arrive in New York ten days after
this letter gets there. SAM.</p>
<p>This is the last personal letter written during that famous first
sea-gipsying, and reading it our regret grows that he did not put
something of his Spanish excursion into his book. He never returned to
Spain, and he never wrote of it. Only the barest mention of “seven
beautiful days“ is found in The Innocents Abroad.</p>
