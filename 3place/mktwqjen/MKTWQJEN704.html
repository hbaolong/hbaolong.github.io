<h4 id="chapter-xix.">CHAPTER XIX.</h4>
<p>Pity is for the living, Envy is for the dead. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s
New Calendar.</p>
<p>The successor of the sheet-iron hamlet of the mangrove marshes has
that other Australian specialty, the Botanical Gardens. We cannot have
these paradises. The best we could do would be to cover a vast acreage
under glass and apply steam heat. But it would be inadequate, the lacks
would still be so great: the confined sense, the sense of suffocation,
the atmospheric dimness, the sweaty heat–these would all be there, in
place of the Australian openness to the sky, the sunshine and the
breeze. Whatever will grow under glass with us will flourish rampantly
out of doors in Australia.–[The greatest heat in Victoria, that there is
an authoritative record of, was at Sandhurst, in January, 1862. The
thermometer then registered 117 degrees in the shade. In January, 1880,
the heat at Adelaide, South Australia, was 172 degrees in the sun.]</p>
<p>When the white man came the continent was nearly as poor, in variety
of vegetation, as the desert of Sahara; now it has everything that grows
on the earth. In fact, not Australia only, but all Australasia has
levied tribute upon the flora of the rest of the world; and wherever one
goes the results appear, in gardens private and public, in the woodsy
walls of the highways, and in even the forests. If you see a curious or
beautiful tree or bush or flower, and ask about it, the people,
answering, usually name a foreign country as the place of its
origin–India, Africa, Japan, China, England, America, Java, Sumatra, New
Guinea, Polynesia, and so on.</p>
<p>In the Zoological Gardens of Adelaide I saw the only laughing jackass
that ever showed any disposition to be courteous to me. This one opened
his head wide and laughed like a demon; or like a maniac who was
consumed with humorous scorn over a cheap and degraded pun. It was a
very human laugh. If he had been out of sight I could have believed that
the laughter came from a man. It is an odd-looking bird, with a head and
beak that are much too large for its body. In time man will exterminate
the rest of the wild creatures of Australia, but this one will probably
survive, for man is his friend and lets him alone. Man always has a good
reason for his charities towards wild things, human or animal when he
has any. In this case the bird is spared because he kills snakes. If L.
J. he will not kill all of them.</p>
<p>In that garden I also saw the wild Australian dog–the dingo. He was a
beautiful creature–shapely, graceful, a little wolfish in some of his
aspects, but with a most friendly eye and sociable disposition. The
dingo is not an importation; he was present in great force when the
whites first came to the continent. It may be that he is the oldest dog
in the universe; his origin, his descent, the place where his ancestors
first appeared, are as unknown and as untraceable as are the camel’s. He
is the most precious dog in the world, for he does not bark. But in an
evil hour he got to raiding the sheep-runs to appease his hunger, and
that sealed his doom. He is hunted, now, just as if he were a wolf. He
has been sentenced to extermination, and the sentence will be carried
out. This is all right, and not objectionable. The world was made for
man–the white man.</p>
<p>South Australia is confusingly named. All of the colonies have a
southern exposure except one–Queensland. Properly speaking, South
Australia is middle Australia. It extends straight up through the center
of the continent like the middle board in a center-table. It is 2,000
miles high, from south to north, and about a third as wide. A wee little
spot down in its southeastern corner contains eight or nine-tenths of
its population; the other one or two-tenths are elsewhere–as elsewhere
as they could be in the United States with all the country between
Denver and Chicago, and Canada and the Gulf of Mexico to scatter over.
There is plenty of room.</p>
<p>A telegraph line stretches straight up north through that 2,000 miles
of wilderness and desert from Adelaide to Port Darwin on the edge of the
upper ocean. South Australia built the line; and did it in 1871-2 when
her population numbered only 185,000. It was a great work; for there
were no roads, no paths; 1,300 miles of the route had been traversed but
once before by white men; provisions, wire, and poles had to be carried
over immense stretches of desert; wells had to be dug along the route to
supply the men and cattle with water.</p>
<p>A cable had been previously laid from Port Darwin to Java and thence
to India, and there was telegraphic communication with England from
India. And so, if Adelaide could make connection with Port Darwin it
meant connection with the whole world. The enterprise succeeded. One
could watch the London markets daily, now; the profit to the
wool-growers of Australia was instant and enormous.</p>
<p>A telegram from Melbourne to San Francisco covers approximately
20,000 miles–the equivalent of five-sixths of the way around the globe.
It has to halt along the way a good many times and be repeated; still,
but little time is lost. These halts, and the distances between them,
are here tabulated.–[From “Round the Empire.“ (George R. Parkin), all
but the last two.]</p>

<p>I was in Adelaide again, some months later, and saw the multitudes
gather in the neighboring city of Glenelg to commemorate the Reading of
the Proclamation–in 1836–which founded the Province. If I have at any
time called it a Colony, I withdraw the discourtesy. It is not a Colony,
it is a Province; and officially so. Moreover, it is the only one so
named in Australasia. There was great enthusiasm; it was the Province’s
national holiday, its Fourth of July, so to speak. It is the pre-eminent
holiday; and that is saying much, in a country where they seem to have a
most un-English mania for holidays. Mainly they are workingmen’s
holidays; for in South Australia the workingman is sovereign; his vote
is the desire of the politician–indeed, it is the very breath of the
politician’s being; the parliament exists to deliver the will of the
workingman, and the government exists to execute it. The workingman is a
great power everywhere in Australia, but South Australia is his
paradise. He has had a hard time in this world, and has earned a
paradise. I am glad he has found it. The holidays there are frequent
enough to be bewildering to the stranger. I tried to get the hang of the
system, but was not able to do it.</p>
<p>You have seen that the Province is tolerant, religious-wise. It is so
politically, also. One of the speakers at the Commemoration banquet–the
Minister of Public Works-was an American, born and reared in New
England. There is nothing narrow about the Province, politically, or in
any other way that I know of. Sixty-four religions and a Yankee cabinet
minister. No amount of horse-racing can damn this community.</p>
<p>The mean temperature of the Province is 62 deg. The death-rate is 13
in the 1,000–about half what it is in the city of New York, I should
think, and New York is a healthy city. Thirteen is the death-rate for
the average citizen of the Province, but there seems to be no death-rate
for the old people. There were people at the Commemoration banquet who
could remember Cromwell. There were six of them. These Old Settlers had
all been present at the original Reading of the Proclamation, in 1536.
They showed signs of the blightings and blastings of time, in their
outward aspect, but they were young within; young and cheerful, and
ready to talk; ready to talk, and talk all you wanted; in their turn,
and out of it. They were down for six speeches, and they made 42. The
governor and the cabinet and the mayor were down for 42 speeches, and
they made 6. They have splendid grit, the Old Settlers, splendid staying
power. But they do not hear well, and when they see the mayor going
through motions which they recognize as the introducing of a speaker,
they think they are the one, and they all get up together, and begin to
respond, in the most animated way; and the more the mayor gesticulates,
and shouts “Sit down! Sit down!“ the more they take it for applause, and
the more excited and reminiscent and enthusiastic they get; and next,
when they see the whole house laughing and crying, three of them think
it is about the bitter old-time hardships they are describing, and the
other three think the laughter is caused by the jokes they have been
uncorking–jokes of the vintage of 1836–and then the way they do go on!
And finally when ushers come and plead, and beg, and gently and
reverently crowd them down into their seats, they say, “Oh, I’m not
tired–I could bang along a week!“ and they sit there looking simple and
childlike, and gentle, and proud of their oratory, and wholly
unconscious of what is going on at the other end of the room. And so one
of the great dignitaries gets a chance, and begins his carefully
prepared speech, impressively and with solemnity–</p>
<p>“When we, now great and prosperous and powerful, bow our heads in
reverent wonder in the contemplation of those sublimities of energy, of
wisdom, of forethought, of—-“</p>
<p>Up come the immortal six again, in a body, with a joyous “Hey, I’ve
thought of another one!“ and at it they go, with might and main, hearing
not a whisper of the pandemonium that salutes them, but taking all the
visible violences for applause, as before, and hammering joyously away
till the imploring ushers pray them into their seats again. And a pity,
too; for those lovely old boys did so enjoy living their heroic youth
over, in these days of their honored antiquity; and certainly the things
they had to tell were usually worth the telling and the hearing.</p>
<p>It was a stirring spectacle; stirring in more ways than one, for it
was amazingly funny, and at the same time deeply pathetic; for they had
seen so much, these time-worn veterans, end had suffered so much; and
had built so strongly and well, and laid the foundations of their
commonwealth so deep, in liberty and tolerance; and had lived to see the
structure rise to such state and dignity and hear themselves so praised
for honorable work.</p>
<p>One of these old gentlemen told me some things of interest afterward;
things about the aboriginals, mainly. He thought them intelligent
–remarkably so in some directions–and he said that along with their
unpleasant qualities they had some exceedingly good ones; and he
considered it a great pity that the race had died out. He instanced
their invention of the boomerang and the “weet-weet“ as evidences of
their brightness; and as another evidence of it he said he had never
seen a white man who had cleverness enough to learn to do the miracles
with those two toys that the aboriginals achieved. He said that even the
smartest whites had been obliged to confess that they could not learn
the trick of the boomerang in perfection; that it had possibilities
which they could not master. The white man could not control its
motions, could not make it obey him; but the aboriginal could. He told
me some wonderful things–some almost incredible things–which he had seen
the blacks do with the boomerang and the weet-weet. They have been
confirmed to me since by other early settlers and by trustworthy
books.</p>
<p>It is contended–and may be said to be conceded–that the boomerang was
known to certain savage tribes in Europe in Roman times. In support of
this, Virgil and two other Roman poets are quoted. It is also contended
that it was known to the ancient Egyptians.</p>
<p>One of two things either some one with is then apparent: a boomerang
arrived in Australia in the days of antiquity before European knowledge
of the thing had been lost, or the Australian aboriginal reinvented it.
It will take some time to find out which of these two propositions is
the fact. But there is no hurry.</p>
