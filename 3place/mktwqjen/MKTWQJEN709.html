<h4 id="chapter-xxiv.">CHAPTER XXIV.</h4>
<p>There is no such thing as “the Queen’s English.“ The property has
gone into the hands of a joint stock company and we own the bulk of the
shares! –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>Frequently, in Australia, one has cloud-effects of an unfamiliar
sort. We had this kind of scenery, finely staged, all the way to
Ballarat. Consequently we saw more sky than country on that journey. At
one time a great stretch of the vault was densely flecked with wee
ragged-edged flakes of painfully white cloud-stuff, all of one shape and
size, and equidistant apart, with narrow cracks of adorable blue showing
between. The whole was suggestive of a hurricane of snow-flakes drifting
across the skies. By and by these flakes fused themselves together in
interminable lines, with shady faint hollows between the lines, the long
satin-surfaced rollers following each other in simulated movement, and
enchantingly counterfeiting the majestic march of a flowing sea. Later,
the sea solidified itself; then gradually broke up its mass into
innumerable lofty white pillars of about one size, and ranged these
across the firmament, in receding and fading perspective, in the
similitude of a stupendous colonnade–a mirage without a doubt flung from
the far Gates of the Hereafter.</p>
<p>The approaches to Ballarat were beautiful. The features, great green
expanses of rolling pasture-land, bisected by eye contenting hedges of
commingled new-gold and old-gold gorse–and a lovely lake. One must put
in the pause, there, to fetch the reader up with a slight jolt, and keep
him from gliding by without noticing the lake. One must notice it; for a
lovely lake is not as common a thing along the railways of Australia as
are the dry places. Ninety-two in the shade again, but balmy and
comfortable, fresh and bracing. A perfect climate.</p>
<p>Forty-five years ago the site now occupied by the City of Ballarat
was a sylvan solitude as quiet as Eden and as lovely. Nobody had ever
heard of it. On the 25th of August, 1851, the first great gold-strike
made in Australia was made here. The wandering prospectors who made it
scraped up two pounds and a half of gold the first day-worth 00. A few
days later the place was a hive–a town. The news of the strike spread
everywhere in a sort of instantaneous way–spread like a flash to the
very ends of the earth. A celebrity so prompt and so universal has
hardly been paralleled in history, perhaps. It was as if the name
BALLARAT had suddenly been written on the sky, where all the world could
read it at once.</p>
<p>The smaller discoveries made in the colony of New South Wales three
months before had already started emigrants toward Australia; they had
been coming as a stream, but they came as a flood, now. A hundred
thousand people poured into Melbourne from England and other countries
in a single month, and flocked away to the mines. The crews of the ships
that brought them flocked with them; the clerks in the government
offices followed; so did the cooks, the maids, the coachmen, the
butlers, and the other domestic servants; so did the carpenters, the
smiths, the plumbers, the painters, the reporters, the editors, the
lawyers, the clients, the barkeepers, the bummers, the blacklegs, the
thieves, the loose women, the grocers, the butchers, the bakers, the
doctors, the druggists, the nurses; so did the police; even officials of
high and hitherto envied place threw up their positions and joined the
procession. This roaring avalanche swept out of Melbourne and left it
desolate, Sunday-like, paralyzed, everything at a stand-still, the ships
lying idle at anchor, all signs of life departed, all sounds stilled
save the rasping of the cloud-shadows as they scraped across the vacant
streets.</p>
<p>That grassy and leafy paradise at Ballarat was soon ripped open, and
lacerated and scarified and gutted, in the feverish search for its
hidden riches. There is nothing like surface-mining to snatch the graces
and beauties and benignities out of a paradise, and make an odious and
repulsive spectacle of it.</p>
<p>What fortunes were made! Immigrants got rich while the ship unloaded
and reloaded–and went back home for good in the same cabin they had come
out in! Not all of them. Only some. I saw the others in Ballarat myself,
forty-five years later–what were left of them by time and death and the
disposition to rove. They were young and gay, then; they are patriarchal
and grave, now; and they do not get excited any more. They talk of the
Past. They live in it. Their life is a dream, a retrospection.</p>
<p>Ballarat was a great region for “nuggets.“ No such nuggets were found
in California as Ballarat produced. In fact, the Ballarat region has
yielded the largest ones known to history. Two of them weighed about 180
pounds each, and together were worth 0,000. They were offered to any
poor person who would shoulder them and carry them away. Gold was so
plentiful that it made people liberal like that.</p>
<p>Ballarat was a swarming city of tents in the early days. Everybody
was happy, for a time, and apparently prosperous. Then came trouble. The
government swooped down with a mining tax. And in its worst form, too;
for it was not a tax upon what the miner had taken out, but upon what he
was going to take out–if he could find it. It was a license-tax license
to work his claim–and it had to be paid before he could begin
digging.</p>
<p>Consider the situation. No business is so uncertain as
surface-mining. Your claim may be good, and it may be worthless. It may
make you well off in a month; and then again you may have to dig and
slave for half a year, at heavy expense, only to find out at last that
the gold is not there in cost-paying quantity, and that your time and
your hard work have been thrown away. It might be wise policy to advance
the miner a monthly sum to encourage him to develop the country’s
riches; but to tax him monthly in advance instead–why, such a thing was
never dreamed of in America. There, neither the claim itself nor its
products, howsoever rich or poor, were taxed.</p>
<p>The Ballarat miners protested, petitioned, complained–it was of no
use; the government held its ground, and went on collecting the tax. And
not by pleasant methods, but by ways which must have been very galling
to free people. The rumblings of a coming storm began to be audible.</p>
<p>By and by there was a result; and I think it may be called the finest
thing in Australasian history. It was a revolution–small in size; but
great politically; it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for a
principle, a stand against injustice and oppression. It was the Barons
and John, over again; it was Hampden and Ship-Money; it was Concord and
Lexington; small beginnings, all of them, but all of them great in
political results, all of them epoch-making. It is another instance of a
victory won by a lost battle. It adds an honorable page to history; the
people know it and are proud of it. They keep green the memory of the
men who fell at the Eureka Stockade, and Peter Lalor has his
monument.</p>
<p>The surface-soil of Ballarat was full of gold. This soil the miners
ripped and tore and trenched and harried and disembowled, and made it
yield up its immense treasure. Then they went down into the earth with
deep shafts, seeking the gravelly beds of ancient rivers and brooks–and
found them. They followed the courses of these streams, and gutted them,
sending the gravel up in buckets to the upper world, and washing out of
it its enormous deposits of gold. The next biggest of the two monster
nuggets mentioned above came from an old river-channel 180 feet under
ground.</p>
<p>Finally the quartz lodes were attacked. That is not poor-man’s
mining. Quartz-mining and milling require capital, and staying-power,
and patience. Big companies were formed, and for several decades, now,
the lodes have been successfully worked, and have yielded great wealth.
Since the gold discovery in 1853 the Ballarat mines–taking the three
kinds of mining together–have contributed to the world’s pocket
something over three hundred millions of dollars, which is to say that
this nearly invisible little spot on the earth’s surface has yielded
about one-fourth as much gold in forty-four years as all California has
yielded in forty-seven. The Californian aggregate, from 1848 to 1895,
inclusive, as reported by the Statistician of the United States Mint, is
,265,215,217.</p>
<p>A citizen told me a curious thing about those mines. With all my
experience of mining I had never heard of anything of the sort before.
The main gold reef runs about north and south–of course for that is the
custom of a rich gold reef. At Ballarat its course is between walls of
slate. Now the citizen told me that throughout a stretch of twelve miles
along the reef, the reef is crossed at intervals by a straight black
streak of a carbonaceous nature–a streak in the slate; a streak no
thicker than a pencil–and that wherever it crosses the reef you will
certainly find gold at the junction. It is called the Indicator. Thirty
feet on each side of the Indicator (and down in the slate, of course) is
a still finer streak–a streak as fine as a pencil mark; and indeed, that
is its name Pencil Mark. Whenever you find the Pencil Mark you know that
thirty feet from it is the Indicator; you measure the distance,
excavate, find the Indicator, trace it straight to the reef, and sink
your shaft; your fortune is made, for certain. If that is true, it is
curious. And it is curious anyway.</p>
<p>Ballarat is a town of only 40,000 population; and yet, since it is in
Australia, it has every essential of an advanced and enlightened big
city. This is pure matter of course. I must stop dwelling upon these
things. It is hard to keep from dwelling upon them, though; for it is
difficult to get away from the surprise of it. I will let the other
details go, this time, but I must allow myself to mention that this
little town has a park of 326 acres; a flower garden of 83 acres, with
an elaborate and expensive fernery in it and some costly and unusually
fine statuary; and an artificial lake covering 600 acres, equipped with
a fleet of 200 shells, small sail boats, and little steam yachts.</p>
<p>At this point I strike out some other praiseful things which I was
tempted to add. I do not strike them out because they were not true or
not well said, but because I find them better said by another man–and a
man more competent to testify, too, because he belongs on the ground,
and knows. I clip them from a chatty speech delivered some years ago by
Mr. William Little, who was at that time mayor of Ballarat:</p>
<p>“The language of our citizens, in this as in other parts of
Australasia, is mostly healthy Anglo-Saxon, free from Americanisms,
vulgarisms, and the conflicting dialects of our Fatherland, and is pure
enough to suit a Trench or a Latham. Our youth, aided by climatic
influence, are in point of physique and comeliness unsurpassed in the
Sunny South. Our young men are well ordered; and our maidens, ‘not
stepping over the bounds of modesty,’ are as fair as Psyches, dispensing
smiles as charming as November flowers.“</p>
<p>The closing clause has the seeming of a rather frosty compliment, but
that is apparent only, not real. November is summer-time there.</p>
<p>His compliment to the local purity of the language is warranted. It
is quite free from impurities; this is acknowledged far and wide. As in
the German Empire all cultivated people claim to speak Hanovarian
German, so in Australasia all cultivated people claim to speak Ballarat
English. Even in England this cult has made considerable progress, and
now that it is favored by the two great Universities, the time is not
far away when Ballarat English will come into general use among the
educated classes of Great Britain at large. Its great merit is, that it
is shorter than ordinary English–that is, it is more compressed. At
first you have some difficulty in understanding it when it is spoken as
rapidly as the orator whom I have quoted speaks it. An illustration will
show what I mean. When he called and I handed him a chair, he bowed and
said:</p>
<p>“Q.“</p>
<p>Presently, when we were lighting our cigars, he held a match to mine
and I said:</p>
<p>“Thank you,“ and he said:</p>
<p>“Km.“</p>
<p>Then I saw. ‘Q’ is the end of the phrase “I thank you“ ‘Km’ is the
end of the phrase “You are welcome.“ Mr. Little puts no emphasis upon
either of them, but delivers them so reduced that they hardly have a
sound. All Ballarat English is like that, and the effect is very soft
and pleasant; it takes all the hardness and harshness out of our tongue
and gives to it a delicate whispery and vanishing cadence which charms
the ear like the faint rustling of the forest leaves.</p>
