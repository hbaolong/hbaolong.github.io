<h4 id="chapter-lxix.">CHAPTER LXIX.</h4>
<p>The very ink with which all history is written is merely fluid
prejudice. –Pudd’nhead Wilsons’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>There isn’t a Parallel of Latitude but thinks it would have been the
Equator if it had had its rights. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>Next to Mr. Rhodes, to me the most interesting convulsion of nature
in South Africa was the diamond-crater. The Rand gold fields are a
stupendous marvel, and they make all other gold fields small, but I was
not a stranger to gold-mining; the veldt was a noble thing to see, but
it was only another and lovelier variety of our Great Plains; the
natives were very far from being uninteresting, but they were not new;
and as for the towns, I could find my way without a guide through the
most of them because I had learned the streets, under other names, in
towns just like them in other lands; but the diamond mine was a wholly
fresh thing, a splendid and absorbing novelty. Very few people in the
world have seen the diamond in its home. It has but three or four homes
in the world, whereas gold has a million. It is worth while to journey
around the globe to see anything which can truthfully be called a
novelty, and the diamond mine is the greatest and most select and
restricted novelty which the globe has in stock.</p>
<p>The Kimberley diamond deposits were discovered about 1869, I think.
When everything is taken into consideration, the wonder is that they
were not discovered five thousand years ago and made familiar to the
African world for the rest of time. For this reason the first diamonds
were found on the surface of the ground. They were smooth and limpid,
and in the sunlight they vomited fire. They were the very things which
an African savage of any era would value above every other thing in the
world excepting a glass bead. For two or three centuries we have been
buying his lands, his cattle, his neighbor, and any other thing he had
for sale, for glass beads and so it is strange that he was indifferent
to the diamonds–for he must have pickets them up many and many a time.
It would not occur to him to try to sell them to whites, of course,
since the whites already had plenty of glass beads, and more fashionably
shaped, too, than these; but one would think that the poorer sort of
black, who could not afford real glass, would have been humbly content
to decorate himself with the imitation, and that presently the white
trader would notice the things, and dimly suspect, and carry some of
them home, and find out what they were, and at once empty a multitude of
fortune-hunters into Africa. There are many strange things in human
history; one of the strangest is that the sparkling diamonds laid there
so long without exciting any one’s interest.</p>
<p>The revelation came at last by accident. In a Boer’s hut out in the
wide solitude of the plains, a traveling stranger noticed a child
playing with a bright object, and was told it was a piece of glass which
had been found in the veldt. The stranger bought it for a trifle and
carried it away; and being without honor, made another stranger believe
it was a diamond, and so got 25 out of him for it, and was as pleased
with himself as if he had done a righteous thing. In Paris the wronged
stranger sold it to a pawnshop for 0,000, who sold it to a countess for
0,000, who sold it to a brewer for 00;000, who traded it to a king for a
dukedom and a pedigree, and the king “put it up the spout.“
–[handwritten note: “From the Greek meaning ‘pawned it.’“ M.T.]–I know
these particulars to be correct.</p>
<p>The news flew around, and the South African diamond-boom began. The
original traveler–the dishonest one–now remembered that he had once seen
a Boer teamster chocking his wagon-wheel on a steep grade with a diamond
as large as a football, and he laid aside his occupations and started
out to hunt for it, but not with the intention of cheating anybody out
of 25 with it, for he had reformed.</p>
<p>We now come to matters more didactic. Diamonds are not imbedded in
rock ledges fifty miles long, like the Johannesburg gold, but are
distributed through the rubbish of a filled-up well, so to speak. The
well is rich, its walls are sharply defined; outside of the walls are no
diamonds. The well is a crater, and a large one. Before it had been
meddled with, its surface was even with the level plain, and there was
no sign to suggest that it was there. The pasturage covering the surface
of the Kimberley crater was sufficient for the support of a cow, and the
pasturage underneath was sufficient for the support of a kingdom; but
the cow did not know it, and lost her chance.</p>
<p>The Kimberley crater is roomy enough to admit the Roman Coliseum; the
bottom of the crater has not been reached, and no one can tell how far
down in the bowels of the earth it goes. Originally, it was a
perpendicular hole packed solidly full of blue rock or cement, and
scattered through that blue mass, like raisins in a pudding, were the
diamonds. As deep down in the earth as the blue stuff extends, so deep
will the diamonds be found.</p>
<p>There are three or four other celebrated craters near by a circle
three miles in diameter would enclose them all. They are owned by the De
Beers Company, a consolidation of diamond properties arranged by
Mr. Rhodes twelve or fourteen years ago. The De Beers owns other
craters; they are under the grass, but the De Beers knows where they
are, and will open them some day, if the market should require it.</p>
<p>Originally, the diamond deposits were the property of the Orange Free
State; but a judicious “rectification“ of the boundary line shifted them
over into the British territory of Cape Colony. A high official of the
Free State told me that the sum of ,00,000 was handed to his
commonwealth as a compromise, or indemnity, or something of the sort,
and that he thought his commonwealth did wisely to take the money and
keep out of a dispute, since the power was all on the one side and the
weakness all on the other. The De Beers Company dig out 00,000 worth of
diamonds per week, now. The Cape got the territory, but no profit; for
Mr. Rhodes and the Rothschilds and the other De Beers people own the
mines, and they pay no taxes.</p>
<p>In our day the mines are worked upon scientific principles, under the
guidance of the ablest mining-engineering talent procurable in America.
There are elaborate works for reducing the blue rock and passing it
through one process after another until every diamond it contains has
been hunted down and secured. I watched the “concentrators“ at work big
tanks containing mud and water and invisible diamonds–and was told that
each could stir and churn and properly treat 300 car-loads of mud per
day 1,600 pounds to the car-load–and reduce it to 3 car-loads of slush.
I saw the 3 carloads of slush taken to the “pulsators“ and there reduced
to quarter of a load of nice clean dark-colored sand. Then I followed it
to the sorting tables and saw the men deftly and swiftly spread it out
and brush it about and seize the diamonds as they showed up. I assisted,
and once I found a diamond half as large as an almond. It is an exciting
kind of fishing, and you feel a fine thrill of pleasure every time you
detect the glow of one of those limpid pebbles through the veil of dark
sand. I would like to spend my Saturday holidays in that charming sport
every now and then. Of course there are disappointments. Sometimes you
find a diamond which is not a diamond; it is only a quartz crystal or
some such worthless thing. The expert can generally distinguish it from
the precious stone which it is counterfeiting; but if he is in doubt he
lays it on a flatiron and hits it with a sledgehammer. If it is a
diamond it holds its own; if it is anything else, it is reduced to
powder. I liked that experiment very much, and did not tire of
repetitions of it. It was full of enjoyable apprehensions, unmarred by
any personal sense of risk. The De Beers concern treats 8;000 carloads
–about 6,000 tons–of blue rock per day, and the result is three pounds
of diamonds. Value, uncut, 0,000 to 0,000. After cutting, they will
weigh considerably less than a pound, but will be worth four or five
times as much as they were before.</p>
<p>All the plain around that region is spread over, a foot deep, with
blue rock, placed there by the Company, and looks like a plowed field.
Exposure for a length of time make the rock easier to work than it is
when it comes out of the mine. If mining should cease now, the supply of
rock spread over those fields would furnish the usual 8,000 car-loads
per day to the separating works during three years. The fields are
fenced and watched; and at night they are under the constant inspection
of lofty electric searchlight. They contain fifty or sixty million
dollars’ worth’ of diamonds, and there is an abundance of enterprising
thieves around.</p>
<p>In the dirt of the Kimberley streets there is much hidden wealth.
Some time ago the people were granted the privilege of a free wash-up.
There was a general rush, the work was done with thoroughness, and a
good harvest of diamonds was gathered.</p>
<p>The deep mining is done by natives. There are many hundreds of them.
They live in quarters built around the inside of a great compound. They
are a jolly and good-natured lot, and accommodating. They performed a
war-dance for us, which was the wildest exhibition I have ever seen.
They are not allowed outside of the compound during their term of
service three months, I think it, is, as a rule. They go down the shaft,
stand their watch, come up again, are searched, and go to bed or to
their amusements in the compound; and this routine they repeat, day in
and day out.</p>
<p>It is thought that they do not now steal many diamonds successfully.
They used to swallow them, and find other ways of concealing them, but
the white man found ways of beating their various games. One man cut his
leg and shoved a diamond into the wound, but even that project did not
succeed. When they find a fine large diamond they are more likely to
report it than to steal it, for in the former case they get a reward,
and in the latter they are quite apt to merely get into trouble. Some
years ago, in a mine not owned by the De Beers, a black found what has
been claimed to be the largest diamond known to the world’s history;
and, as a reward he was released from service and given a blanket, a
horse, and five hundred dollars. It made him a Vanderbilt. He could buy
four wives, and have money left. Four wives are an ample support for a
native. With four wives he is wholly independent, and need never do a
stroke of work again.</p>
<p>That great diamond weighs 97l carats. Some say it is as big as a
piece of alum, others say it is as large as a bite of rock candy, but
the best authorities agree that it is almost exactly the size of a chunk
of ice. But those details are not important; and in my opinion not
trustworthy. It has a flaw in it, otherwise it would be of incredible
value. As it is, it is held to be worth ,000,000. After cutting it ought
to be worth from ,000,000 to ,000,000, therefore persons desiring to
save money should buy it now. It is owned by a syndicate, and apparently
there is no satisfactory market for it. It is earning nothing; it is
eating its head off. Up to this time it has made nobody rich but the
native who found it.</p>
<p>He found it in a mine which was being worked by contract. That is to
say, a company had bought the privilege of taking from the mine
5,000,000 carloads of blue-rock, for a sum down and a royalty. Their
speculation had not paid; but on the very day that their privilege ran
out that native found the ,000,000-diamond and handed it over to them.
Even the diamond culture is not without its romantic episodes.</p>
<p>The Koh-i-Noor is a large diamond, and valuable; but it cannot
compete in these matters with three which–according to legend–are among
the crown trinkets of Portugal and Russia. One of these is held to be
worth 0,000,000; another, 5,000,000, and the third something over
8,000,000.</p>
<p>Those are truly wonderful diamonds, whether they exist or not; and
yet they are of but little importance by comparison with the one
wherewith the Boer wagoner chocked his wheel on that steep grade as
heretofore referred to. In Kimberley I had some conversation with the
man who saw the Boer do that–an incident which had occurred twenty-seven
or twenty-eight years before I had my talk with him. He assured me that
that diamond’s value could have been over a billion dollars, but not
under it. I believed him, because he had devoted twenty-seven years to
hunting for it, and was, in a position to know.</p>
<p>A fitting and interesting finish to an examination of the tedious and
laborious and costly processes whereby the diamonds are gotten out of
the deeps of the earth and freed from the base stuffs which imprison
them is the visit to the De Beers offices in the town of Kimberley,
where the result of each day’s mining is brought every day, and,
weighed, assorted, valued, and deposited in safes against shipping-day.
An unknown and unaccredited person cannot, get into that place; and it
seemed apparent from the generous supply of warning and protective and
prohibitory signs that were posted all about, that not even the known
and accredited can steal diamonds there without inconvenience.</p>
<p>We saw the day’s output–shining little nests of diamonds, distributed
a foot apart, along a counter, each nest reposing upon a sheet of white
paper. That day’s catch was about 0,000 worth. In the course of a year
half a ton of diamonds pass under the scales there and sleep on that
counter; the resulting money is 8,000,000 or 0,000,000. Profit, about
2,000,000.</p>
<p>Young girls were doing the sorting–a nice, clean, dainty, and
probably distressing employment. Every day ducal incomes sift and
sparkle through the fingers of those young girls; yet they go to bed at
night as poor as they were when they got up in the morning. The same
thing next day, and all the days.</p>
<p>They are beautiful things, those diamonds, in their native state.
They are of various shapes; they have flat surfaces, rounded borders,
and never a sharp edge. They are of all colors and shades of color, from
dewdrop white to actual black; and their smooth and rounded surfaces and
contours, variety of color, and transparent limpidity make them look
like piles of assorted candies. A very light straw color is their
commonest tint. It seemed to me that these uncut gems must be more
beautiful than any cut ones could be; but when a collection of cut ones
was brought out, I saw my mistake. Nothing is so beautiful as a rose
diamond with the light playing through it, except that uncostly thing
which is just like it–wavy sea-water with the sunlight playing through
it and striking a white-sand bottom.</p>
<p>Before the middle of July we reached Cape Town, and the end of our
African journeyings. And well satisfied; for, towering above us was
Table Mountain–a reminder that we had now seen each and all of the great
features of South Africa except Mr. Cecil Rhodes. I realize that that is
a large exception. I know quite well that whether Mr. Rhodes is the
lofty and worshipful patriot and statesman that multitudes believe him
to be, or Satan come again, as the rest of the world account him, he is
still the most imposing figure in the British empire outside of England.
When he stands on the Cape of Good Hope, his shadow falls to the
Zambesi. He is the only colonial in the British dominions whose goings
and comings are chronicled and discussed under all the globe’s
meridians, and whose speeches, unclipped, are cabled from the ends of
the earth; and he is the only unroyal outsider whose arrival in London
can compete for attention with an eclipse.</p>
<p>That he is an extraordinary man, and not an accident of fortune, not
even his dearest South African enemies were willing to deny, so far as I
heard them testify. The whole South African world seemed to stand in a
kind of shuddering awe of him, friend and enemy alike. It was as if he
were deputy-God on the one side, deputy-Satan on the other, proprietor
of the people, able to make them or ruin them by his breath, worshiped
by many, hated by many, but blasphemed by none among the judicious, and
even by the indiscreet in guarded whispers only.</p>
<p>What is the secret of his formidable supremacy? One says it is his
prodigious wealth–a wealth whose drippings in salaries and in other ways
support multitudes and make them his interested and loyal vassals;
another says it is his personal magnetism and his persuasive tongue, and
that these hypnotize and make happy slaves of all that drift within the
circle of their influence; another says it is his majestic ideas, his
vast schemes for the territorial aggrandizement of England, his
patriotic and unselfish ambition to spread her beneficent protection and
her just rule over the pagan wastes of Africa and make luminous the
African darkness with the glory of her name; and another says he wants
the earth and wants it for his own, and that the belief that he will get
it and let his friends in on the ground floor is the secret that rivets
so many eyes upon him and keeps him in the zenith where the view is
unobstructed.</p>
<p>One may take his choice. They are all the same price. One fact is
sure: he keeps his prominence and a vast following, no matter what he
does. He “deceives“ the Duke of Fife–it is the Duke’s word–but that does
not destroy the Duke’s loyalty to him. He tricks the Reformers into
immense trouble with his Raid, but the most of them believe he meant
well. He weeps over the harshly–taxed Johannesburgers and makes them his
friends; at the same time he taxes his Charter-settlers 50 per cent.,
and so wins their affection and their confidence that they are squelched
with despair at every rumor that the Charter is to be annulled. He raids
and robs and slays and enslaves the Matabele and gets worlds of
Charter-Christian applause for it. He has beguiled England into buying
Charter waste paper for Bank of England notes, ton for ton, and the
ravished still burn incense to him as the Eventual God of Plenty. He has
done everything he could think of to pull himself down to the ground; he
has done more than enough to pull sixteen common-run great men down; yet
there he stands, to this day, upon his dizzy summit under the dome of
the sky, an apparent permanency, the marvel of the time, the mystery of
the age, an Archangel with wings to half the world, Satan with a tail to
the other half.</p>
<p>I admire him, I frankly confess it; and when his time comes I shall
buy a piece of the rope for a keepsake.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION.</p>
<p>I have traveled more than anyone else, and I have noticed that even
the angels speak English with an accent. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New
Calendar.</p>
<p>I saw Table Rock, anyway–a majestic pile. It is 3,000 feet high. It
is also 17,000 feet high. These figures may be relied upon. I got them
in Cape Town from the two best-informed citizens, men who had made Table
Rock the study of their lives. And I saw Table Bay, so named for its
levelness. I saw the Castle–built by the Dutch East India Company three
hundred years ago–where the Commanding General lives; I saw St. Simon’s
Bay, where the Admiral lives. I saw the Government, also the Parliament,
where they quarreled in two languages when I was there, and agreed in
none. I saw the club. I saw and explored the beautiful sea-girt drives
that wind about the mountains and through the paradise where the villas
are: Also I saw some of the fine old Dutch mansions, pleasant homes of
the early times, pleasant homes to-day, and enjoyed the privilege of
their hospitalities.</p>
<p>And just before I sailed I saw in one of them a quaint old picture
which was a link in a curious romance–a picture of a pale, intellectual
young man in a pink coat with a high black collar. It was a portrait of
Dr. James Barry, a military surgeon who came out to the Cape fifty years
ago with his regiment. He was a wild young fellow, and was guilty of
various kinds of misbehavior. He was several times reported to
headquarters in England, and it was in each case expected that orders
would come out to deal with him promptly and severely, but for some
mysterious reason no orders of any kind ever came back–nothing came but
just an impressive silence. This made him an imposing and uncanny wonder
to the town.</p>
<p>Next, he was promoted-away up. He was made Medical Superintendent
General, and transferred to India. Presently he was back at the Cape
again and at his escapades once more. There were plenty of pretty girls,
but none of them caught him, none of them could get hold of his heart;
evidently he was not a marrying man. And that was another marvel,
another puzzle, and made no end of perplexed talk. Once he was called in
the night, an obstetric service, to do what he could for a woman who was
believed to be dying. He was prompt and scientific, and saved both
mother and child. There are other instances of record which testify to
his mastership of his profession; and many which testify to his love of
it and his devotion to it. Among other adventures of his was a duel of a
desperate sort, fought with swords, at the Castle. He killed his
man.</p>
<p>The child heretofore mentioned as having been saved by Dr. Barry so
long ago, was named for him, and still lives in Cape Town. He had
Dr. Barry’s portrait painted, and gave it to the gentleman in whose old
Dutch house I saw it–the quaint figure in pink coat and high black
collar.</p>
<p>The story seems to be arriving nowhere. But that is because I have
not finished. Dr. Barry died in Cape Town 30 years ago. It was then
discovered that he was a woman.</p>
<p>The legend goes that enquiries–soon silenced–developed the fact that
she was a daughter of a great English house, and that that was why her
Cape wildnesses brought no punishment and got no notice when reported to
the government at home. Her name was an alias. She had disgraced herself
with her people; so she chose to change her name and her sex and take a
new start in the world.</p>
<p>We sailed on the 15th of July in the Norman, a beautiful ship,
perfectly appointed. The voyage to England occupied a short fortnight,
without a stop except at Madeira. A good and restful voyage for tired
people, and there were several of us. I seemed to have been lecturing a
thousand years, though it was only a twelvemonth, and a considerable
number of the others were Reformers who were fagged out with their five
months of seclusion in the Pretoria prison.</p>
<p>Our trip around the earth ended at the Southampton pier, where we
embarked thirteen months before. It seemed a fine and large thing to
have accomplished–the circumnavigation of this great globe in that
little time, and I was privately proud of it. For a moment. Then came
one of those vanity-snubbing astronomical reports from the
Observatory-people, whereby it appeared that another great body of light
had lately flamed up in the remotenesses of space which was traveling at
a gait which would enable it to do all that I had done in a minute and a
half. Human pride is not worth while; there is always something lying in
wait to take the wind out of it.</p>
