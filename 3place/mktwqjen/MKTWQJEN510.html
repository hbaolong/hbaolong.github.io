<h4 id="chapter-xxvii.">CHAPTER XXVII.</h4>
<p>DRILLING THE KING</p>
<p>On the morning of the fourth day, when it was just sunrise, and we
had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn, I came to a resolution: the
king <em>must</em> be drilled; things could not go on so, he must be
taken in hand and deliberately and conscientiously drilled, or we
couldn’t ever venture to enter a dwelling; the very cats would know this
masquerader for a humbug and no peasant. So I called a halt and
said:</p>
<p>“Sire, as between clothes and countenance, you are all right, there
is no discrepancy; but as between your clothes and your bearing, you are
all wrong, there is a most noticeable discrepancy. Your soldierly
stride, your lordly port–these will not do. You stand too straight, your
looks are too high, too confident. The cares of a kingdom do not stoop
the shoulders, they do not droop the chin, they do not depress the high
level of the eye-glance, they do not put doubt and fear in the heart and
hang out the signs of them in slouching body and unsure step. It is the
sordid cares of the lowly born that do these things. You must learn the
trick; you must imitate the trademarks of poverty, misery, oppression,
insult, and the other several and common inhumanities that sap the
manliness out of a man and make him a loyal and proper and approved
subject and a satisfaction to his masters, or the very infants will know
you for better than your disguise, and we shall go to pieces at the
first hut we stop at. Pray try to walk like this.“</p>
<p>The king took careful note, and then tried an imitation.</p>
<p>“Pretty fair–pretty fair. Chin a little lower, please–there, very
good. Eyes too high; pray don’t look at the horizon, look at the ground,
ten steps in front of you. Ah–that is better, that is very good. Wait,
please; you betray too much vigor, too much decision; you want more of a
shamble. Look at me, please–this is what I mean…. Now you are getting
it; that is the idea–at least, it sort of approaches it…. Yes, that is
pretty fair. <em>But!</em> There is a great big something wanting, I
don’t quite know what it is. Please walk thirty yards, so that I can get
a perspective on the thing…. Now, then–your head’s right, speed’s right,
shoulders right, eyes right, chin right, gait, carriage, general style
right–everything’s right! And yet the fact remains, the aggregate’s
wrong. The account don’t balance. Do it again, please…. <em>Now</em> I
think I begin to see what it is. Yes, I’ve struck it. You see, the
genuine spiritlessness is wanting; that’s what’s the trouble. It’s all
<em>amateur</em>–mechanical details all right, almost to a hair;
everything about the delusion perfect, except that it don’t delude.“</p>
<p>“What, then, must one do, to prevail?“</p>
<p>“Let me think… I can’t seem to quite get at it. In fact, there isn’t
anything that can right the matter but practice. This is a good place
for it: roots and stony ground to break up your stately gait, a region
not liable to interruption, only one field and one hut in sight, and
they so far away that nobody could see us from there. It will be well to
move a little off the road and put in the whole day drilling you,
sire.“</p>
<p>After the drill had gone on a little while, I said:</p>
<p>“Now, sire, imagine that we are at the door of the hut yonder, and
the family are before us. Proceed, please–accost the head of the
house.“</p>
<p>The king unconsciously straightened up like a monument, and said,
with frozen austerity:</p>
<p>“Varlet, bring a seat; and serve to me what cheer ye have.“</p>
<p>“Ah, your grace, that is not well done.“</p>
<p>“In what lacketh it?“</p>
<p>“These people do not call <em>each other</em> varlets.“</p>
<p>“Nay, is that true?“</p>
<p>“Yes; only those above them call them so.“</p>
<p>“Then must I try again. I will call him villein.“</p>
<p>“No-no; for he may be a freeman.“</p>
<p>“Ah–so. Then peradventure I should call him goodman.“</p>
<p>“That would answer, your grace, but it would be still better if you
said friend, or brother.“</p>
<p>“Brother!–to dirt like that?“</p>
<p>“Ah, but <em>we</em> are pretending to be dirt like that, too.“</p>
<p>“It is even true. I will say it. Brother, bring a seat, and thereto
what cheer ye have, withal. Now ’tis right.“</p>
<p>“Not quite, not wholly right. You have asked for one, not <em>us</em>
–for one, not both; food for one, a seat for one.“</p>
<p>The king looked puzzled–he wasn’t a very heavy weight,
intellectually. His head was an hour-glass; it could stow an idea, but
it had to do it a grain at a time, not the whole idea at once.</p>
<p>“Would <em>you</em> have a seat also–and sit?“</p>
<p>“If I did not sit, the man would perceive that we were only
pretending to be equals–and playing the deception pretty poorly,
too.“</p>
<p>“It is well and truly said! How wonderful is truth, come it in
whatsoever unexpected form it may! Yes, he must bring out seats and food
for both, and in serving us present not ewer and napkin with more show
of respect to the one than to the other.“</p>
<p>“And there is even yet a detail that needs correcting. He must bring
nothing outside; we will go in–in among the dirt, and possibly other
repulsive things,–and take the food with the household, and after the
fashion of the house, and all on equal terms, except the man be of the
serf class; and finally, there will be no ewer and no napkin, whether he
be serf or free. Please walk again, my liege. There–it is better–it is
the best yet; but not perfect. The shoulders have known no ignobler
burden than iron mail, and they will not stoop.“</p>
<p>“Give me, then, the bag. I will learn the spirit that goeth with
burdens that have not honor. It is the spirit that stoopeth the
shoulders, I ween, and not the weight; for armor is heavy, yet it is a
proud burden, and a man standeth straight in it…. Nay, but me no buts,
offer me no objections. I will have the thing. Strap it upon my
back.“</p>
<p>He was complete now with that knapsack on, and looked as little like
a king as any man I had ever seen. But it was an obstinate pair of
shoulders; they could not seem to learn the trick of stooping with any
sort of deceptive naturalness. The drill went on, I prompting and
correcting:</p>
<p>“Now, make believe you are in debt, and eaten up by relentless
creditors; you are out of work–which is horse-shoeing, let us say–and
can get none; and your wife is sick, your children are crying because
they are hungry–“</p>
<p>And so on, and so on. I drilled him as representing in turn all sorts
of people out of luck and suffering dire privations and misfortunes. But
lord, it was only just words, words–they meant nothing in the world to
him, I might just as well have whistled. Words realize nothing, vivify
nothing to you, unless you have suffered in your own person the thing
which the words try to describe. There are wise people who talk ever so
knowingly and complacently about “the working classes,“ and satisfy
themselves that a day’s hard intellectual work is very much harder than
a day’s hard manual toil, and is righteously entitled to much bigger
pay. Why, they really think that, you know, because they know all about
the one, but haven’t tried the other. But I know all about both; and so
far as I am concerned, there isn’t money enough in the universe to hire
me to swing a pickaxe thirty days, but I will do the hardest kind of
intellectual work for just as near nothing as you can cipher it down–and
I will be satisfied, too.</p>
<p>Intellectual “work“ is misnamed; it is a pleasure, a dissipation, and
is its own highest reward. The poorest paid architect, engineer,
general, author, sculptor, painter, lecturer, advocate, legislator,
actor, preacher, singer is constructively in heaven when he is at work;
and as for the musician with the fiddle-bow in his hand who sits in the
midst of a great orchestra with the ebbing and flowing tides of divine
sound washing over him–why, certainly, he is at work, if you wish to
call it that, but lord, it’s a sarcasm just the same. The law of work
does seem utterly unfair–but there it is, and nothing can change it: the
higher the pay in enjoyment the worker gets out of it, the higher shall
be his pay in cash, also. And it’s also the very law of those
transparent swindles, transmissible nobility and kingship.</p>
