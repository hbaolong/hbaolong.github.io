<h4 id="chapter-xxv.">CHAPTER XXV.</h4>
<p>Hawkins went straight to the telegraph office and disburdened his
conscience. He said to himself, “She’s not going to give this galvanized
cadaver up, that’s plain. Wild horses can’t pull her away from him. I’ve
done my share; it’s for Sellers to take an innings, now.“ So he sent
this message to New York:</p>
<p>“Come back. Hire special train. She’s going to marry the
materializee.“</p>
<p>Meantime a note came to Rossmore Towers to say that the Earl of
Rossmore had just arrived from England, and would do himself the
pleasure of calling in the evening. Sally said to herself, “It is a pity
he didn’t stop in New York; but it’s no matter; he can go up to-morrow
and see my father. He has come over here to tomahawk papa, very
likely–or buy out his claim. This thing would have excited me, a while
back; but it has only one interest for me now, and only one value. I can
say to–to– Spine, Spiny, Spinal–I don’t like any form of that name!–I
can say to him to-morrow, ‘Don’t try to keep it up any more, or I shall
have to tell you whom I have been talking with last night, and then you
will be embarrassed.’“</p>
<p>Tracy couldn’t know he was to be invited for the morrow, or he might
have waited. As it was, he was too miserable to wait any longer; for his
last hope–a letter–had failed him. It was fully due to-day; it had not
come. Had his father really flung him away? It looked so. It was not
like his father, but it surely looked so. His father was a rather tough
nut, in truth, but had never been so with his son–still, this implacable
silence had a calamitous look. Anyway, Tracy would go to the Towers and
–then what? He didn’t know; his head was tired out with thinking– he
wouldn’t think about what he must do or say–let it all take care of
itself. So that he saw Sally once more, he would be satisfied, happen
what might; he wouldn’t care.</p>
<p>He hardly knew how he got to the Towers, or when. He knew and cared
for only one thing–he was alone with Sally. She was kind, she was
gentle, there was moisture in her eyes, and a yearning something in her
face and manner which she could not wholly hide–but she kept her
distance. They talked. Bye and bye she said–watching his downcast
countenance out of the corner of her eye–</p>
<p>“It’s so lonesome–with papa and mamma gone. I try to read, but I
can’t seem to get interested in any book. I try the newspapers, but they
do put such rubbish in them. You take up a paper and start to read
something you thinks interesting, and it goes on and on and on about how
somebody–well, Dr. Snodgrass, for instance–“</p>
<p>Not a movement from Tracy, not the quiver of a muscle. Sally was
amazed –what command of himself he must have! Being disconcerted, she
paused so long that Tracy presently looked up wearily and said:</p>
<p>“Well?“</p>
<p>“Oh, I thought you were not listening. Yes, it goes on and on about
this Doctor Snodgrass, till you are so tired, and then about his younger
son– the favorite son–Zylobalsamum Snodgrass–“</p>
<p>Not a sign from Tracy, whose head was drooping again. What
supernatural self-possession! Sally fixed her eye on him and began
again, resolved to blast him out of his serenity this time if she knew
how to apply the dynamite that is concealed in certain forms of words
when those words are properly loaded with unexpected meanings.</p>
<p>“And next it goes on and on and on about the eldest son–not the
favorite, this one–and how he is neglected in his poor barren boyhood,
and allowed to grow up unschooled, ignorant, coarse, vulgar, the comrade
of the community’s scum, and become in his completed manhood a rude,
profane, dissipated ruffian–“</p>
<p>That head still drooped! Sally rose, moved softly and solemnly a step
or two, and stood before Tracy–his head came slowly up, his meek eyes
met her intense ones–then she finished with deep impressiveness–</p>
<p>“–named Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass!“</p>
<p>Tracy merely exhibited signs of increased fatigue. The girl was
outraged by this iron indifference and callousness, and cried out–</p>
<p>“What are you made of?“</p>
<p>“I? Why?“</p>
<p>“Haven’t you any sensitiveness? Don’t these things touch any poor
remnant of delicate feeling in you?“</p>
<p>“N–no,“ he said wonderingly, “they don’t seem to. Why should
they?“</p>
<p>“O, dear me, how can you look so innocent, and foolish, and good, and
empty, and gentle, and all that, right in the hearing of such things as
those! Look me in the eye–straight in the eye. There, now then, answer
me without a flinch. Isn’t Doctor Snodgrass your father, and isn’t
Zylobalsamum your brother,“ [here Hawkins was about to enter the room,
but changed his mind upon hearing these words, and elected for a walk
down town, and so glided swiftly away], “and isn’t your name Spinal
Meningitis, and isn’t your father a doctor and an idiot, like all the
family for generations, and doesn’t he name all his children after
poisons and pestilences and abnormal anatomical eccentricities of the
human body? Answer me, some way or somehow–and quick. Why do you sit
there looking like an envelope without any address on it and see me
going mad before your face with suspense!“</p>
<p>“Oh, I wish I could do–do–I wish I could do something, anything that
would give you peace again and make you happy; but I know of nothing– I
know of no way. I have never heard of these awful people before.“</p>
<p>“What? Say it again!“</p>
<p>“I have never–never in my life till now.“</p>
<p>“Oh, you do look so honest when you say that! It must be true–surely
you couldn’t look that way, you wouldn’t look that way if it were not
true–would you?“</p>
<p>“I couldn’t and wouldn’t. It is true. Oh, let us end this suffering–
take me back into your heart and confidence–“</p>
<p>“Wait–one more thing. Tell me you told that falsehood out of mere
vanity and are sorry for it; that you’re not expecting to ever wear the
coronet of an earl–“</p>
<p>“Truly I am cured–cured this very day–I am not expecting it!“</p>
<p>“O, now you are mine! I’ve got you back in the beauty and glory of
your unsmirched poverty and your honorable obscurity, and nobody shall
ever take you from me again but the grave! And if–“</p>
<p>“De earl of Rossmore, fum Englan’!“</p>
<p>“My father!“ The young man released the girl and hung his head.</p>
<p>The old gentleman stood surveying the couple–the one with a strongly
complimentary right eye, the other with a mixed expression done with the
left. This is difficult, and not often resorted to. Presently his face
relaxed into a kind of constructive gentleness, and he said to his
son:</p>
<p>“Don’t you think you could embrace me, too?“</p>
<p>The young man did it with alacrity. “Then you are the son of an earl,
after all,“ said Sally, reproachfully.</p>
<p>“Yes, I–“</p>
<p>“Then I won’t have you!“</p>
<p>“O, but you know–“</p>
<p>“No, I will not. You’ve told me another fib.“</p>
<p>“She’s right. Go away and leave us. I want to talk with her.“</p>
<p>Berkeley was obliged to go. But he did not go far. He remained on the
premises. At midnight the conference between the old gentleman and the
young girl was still going blithely on, but it presently drew to a
close, and the former said:</p>
<p>“I came all the way over here to inspect you, my dear, with the
general idea of breaking off this match if there were two fools of you,
but as there’s only one, you can have him if you’ll take him.“</p>
<p>“Indeed I will, then! May I kiss you?“</p>
<p>“You may. Thank you. Now you shall have that privilege whenever you
are good.“</p>
<p>Meantime Hawkins had long ago returned and slipped up into the
laboratory. He was rather disconcerted to find his late invention,
Snodgrass, there. The news was told him that the English Rossmore was
come,</p>
<p>–“and I’m his son, Viscount Berkeley, not Howard Tracy any more.“</p>
<p>Hawkins was aghast. He said:</p>
<p>“Good gracious, then you’re dead!“</p>
<p>“Dead?“</p>
<p>“Yes you are–we’ve got your ashes.“</p>
<p>“Hang those ashes, I’m tired of them; I’ll give them to my
father.“</p>
<p>Slowly and painfully the statesman worked the truth into his head
that this was really a flesh and blood young man, and not the
insubstantial resurrection he and Sellers had so long supposed him to
be. Then he said with feeling–</p>
<p>“I’m so glad; so glad on Sally’s account, poor thing. We took you for
a departed materialized bank thief from Tahlequah. This will be a heavy
blow to Sellers.“ Then he explained the whole matter to Berkeley, who
said:</p>
<p>“Well, the Claimant must manage to stand the blow, severe as it is.
But he’ll get over the disappointment.“</p>
<p>“Who–the colonel? He’ll get over it the minute he invents a new
miracle to take its place. And he’s already at it by this time. But look
here– what do you suppose became of the man you’ve been representing all
this time?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I saved his clothes–it was all I could do. I am afraid
he lost his life.“</p>
<p>“Well, you must have found twenty or thirty thousand dollars in those
clothes, in money or certificates of deposit.“</p>
<p>“No, I found only five hundred and a trifle. I borrowed the trifle
and banked the five hundred.“</p>
<p>“What’ll we do about it?“</p>
<p>“Return it to the owner.“</p>
<p>“It’s easy said, but not easy to manage. Let’s leave it alone till we
get Sellers’s advice. And that reminds me. I’ve got to run and meet
Sellers and explain who you are not and who you are, or he’ll come
thundering in here to stop his daughter from marrying a phantom. But–
suppose your father came over here to break off the match?“</p>
<p>“Well, isn’t he down stairs getting acquainted with Sally? That’s all
safe.“</p>
<p>So Hawkins departed to meet and prepare the Sellerses.</p>
<p>Rossmore Towers saw great times and late hours during the succeeding
week. The two earls were such opposites in nature that they fraternized
at once. Sellers said privately that Rossmore was the most extraordinary
character he had ever met–a man just made out of the condensed milk of
human kindness, yet with the ability to totally hide the fact from any
but the most practised character-reader; a man whose whole being was
sweetness, patience and charity, yet with a cunning so profound, an
ability so marvelous in the acting of a double part, that many a person
of considerable intelligence might live with him for centuries and never
suspect the presence in him of these characteristics.</p>
<p>Finally there was a quiet wedding at the Towers, instead of a big one
at the British embassy, with the militia and the fire brigades and the
temperance organizations on hand in torchlight procession, as at first
proposed by one of the earls. The art-firm and Barrow were present at
the wedding, and the tinner and Puss had been invited, but the tinner
was ill and Puss was nursing him–for they were engaged.</p>
<p>The Sellerses were to go to England with their new allies for a brief
visit, but when it was time to take the train from Washington, the
colonel was missing.</p>
<p>Hawkins was going as far as New York with the party, and said he
would explain the matter on the road.</p>
<p>The explanation was in a letter left by the colonel in Hawkins’s
hands. In it he promised to join Mrs. Sellers later, in England, and
then went on to say:</p>
<p>The truth is, my dear Hawkins, a mighty idea has been born to me
within the hour, and I must not even stop to say goodbye to my dear
ones. A man’s highest duty takes precedence of all minor ones, and must
be attended to with his best promptness and energy, at whatsoever cost
to his affections or his convenience. And first of all a man’s duties is
his duty to his own honor–he must keep that spotless. Mine is
threatened. When I was feeling sure of my imminent future solidity, I
forwarded to the Czar of Russia–perhaps prematurely–an offer for the
purchase of Siberia, naming a vast sum. Since then an episode has warned
me that the method by which I was expecting to acquire this money–
materialization upon a scale of limitless magnitude–is marred by a taint
of temporary uncertainty. His imperial majesty may accept my offer at
any moment. If this should occur now, I should find myself painfully
embarrassed, in fact financially inadequate. I could not take Siberia.
This would become known, and my credit would suffer.</p>
<p>Recently my private hours have been dark indeed, but the sun shines
main, now; I see my way; I shall be able to meet my obligation, and
without having to ask an extension of the stipulated time, I think. This
grand new idea of mine–the sublimest I have ever conceived, will save me
whole, I am sure. I am leaving for San Francisco this moment, to test
it, by the help of the great Lick telescope. Like all of my more notable
discoveries and inventions, it is based upon hard, practical scientific
laws; all other bases are unsound and hence untrustworthy. In brief,
then, I have conceived the stupendous idea of reorganizing the climates
of the earth according to the desire of the populations interested. That
is to say, I will furnish climates to order, for cash or negotiable
paper, taking the old climates in part payment, of course, at a fair
discount, where they are in condition to be repaired at small cost and
let out for hire to poor and remote communities not able to afford a
good climate and not caring for an expensive one for mere display. My
studies have convinced me that the regulation of climates and the
breeding of new varieties at will from the old stock is a feasible
thing. Indeed I am convinced that it has been done before; done in
prehistoric times by now forgotten and unrecorded civilizations.
Everywhere I find hoary evidences of artificial manipulation of climates
in bygone times. Take the glacial period. Was that produced by accident?
Not at all; it was done for money. I have a thousand proofs of it, and
will some day reveal them.</p>
<p>I will confide to you an outline of my idea. It is to utilize the
spots on the sun–get control of them, you understand, and apply the
stupendous energies which they wield to beneficent purposes in the
reorganizing of our climates. At present they merely make trouble and do
harm in the evoking of cyclones and other kinds of electric storms; but
once under humane and intelligent control this will cease and they will
become a boon to man.</p>
<p>I have my plan all mapped out, whereby I hope and expect to acquire
complete and perfect control of the sun-spots, also details of the
method whereby I shall employ the same commercially; but I will not
venture to go into particulars before the patents shall have been
issued. I shall hope and expect to sell shop-rights to the minor
countries at a reasonable figure and supply a good business article of
climate to the great empires at special rates, together with fancy
brands for coronations, battles and other great and particular
occasions. There are billions of money in this enterprise, no expensive
plant is required, and I shall begin to realize in a few days–in a few
weeks at furthest. I shall stand ready to pay cash for Siberia the
moment it is delivered, and thus save my honor and my credit. I am
confident of this.</p>
<p>I would like you to provide a proper outfit and start north as soon
as I telegraph you, be it night or be it day. I wish you to take up all
the country stretching away from the north pole on all sides for many
degrees south, and buy Greenland and Iceland at the best figure you can
get now while they are cheap. It is my intention to move one of the
tropics up there and transfer the frigid zone to the equator. I will
have the entire Arctic Circle in the market as a summer resort next
year, and will use the surplusage of the old climate, over and above
what can be utilized on the equator, to reduce the temperature of
opposition resorts. But I have said enough to give you an idea of the
prodigious nature of my scheme and the feasible and enormously
profitable character of it. I shall join all you happy people in England
as soon as I shall have sold out some of my principal climates and
arranged with the Czar about Siberia.</p>
<p>Meantime, watch for a sign from me. Eight days from now, we shall be
wide asunder; for I shall be on the border of the Pacific, and you far
out on the Atlantic, approaching England. That day, if I am alive and my
sublime discovery is proved and established, I will send you greeting,
and my messenger shall deliver it where you are, in the solitudes of the
sea; for I will waft a vast sun-spot across the disk like drifting
smoke, and you will know it for my love-sign, and will say “Mulberry
Sellers throws us a kiss across the universe.“</p>
<p>APPENDIX.</p>
<p>WEATHER FOR USE IN THIS BOOK.</p>
<p>Selected from the Best Authorities.</p>
<p>A brief though violent thunderstorm which had raged over the city was
passing away; but still, though the rain had ceased more than an hour
before, wild piles of dark and coppery clouds, in which a fierce and
rayless glow was laboring, gigantically overhung the grotesque and
huddled vista of dwarf houses, while in the distance, sheeting high over
the low, misty confusion of gables and chimneys, spread a pall of dead,
leprous blue, suffused with blotches of dull, glistening yellow, and
with black plague-spots of vapor floating and faint lightnings crinkling
on its surface. Thunder, still muttering in the close and sultry air,
kept the scared dwellers in the street within, behind their closed
shutters; and all deserted, cowed, dejected, squalid, like poor, stupid,
top-heavy things that had felt the wrath of the summer tempest, stood
the drenched structures on either side of the narrow and crooked way,
ghastly and picturesque, under the giant canopy. Rain dripped wretchedly
in slow drops of melancholy sound from their projecting eaves upon the
broken flagging, lay there in pools or trickled into the swollen drains,
where the fallen torrent sullenly gurgled on its way to the river. “The
Brazen Android.“-W. D. O’Connor.</p>
<p>The fiery mid-March sun a moment hung Above the bleak Judean
wilderness; Then darkness swept upon us, and ’t was night. “Easter-Eve
at Kerak-Moab.“–Clinton Scollard.</p>
<p>The quick-coming winter twilight was already at hand. Snow was again
falling, sifting delicately down, incidentally as it were. “Felicia.“
Fanny N. D. Murfree.</p>
<p>Merciful heavens! The whole west, from right to left, blazes up with
a fierce light, and next instant the earth reels and quivers with the
awful shock of ten thousand batteries of artillery. It is the signal for
the Fury to spring–for a thousand demons to scream and shriek–for
innumerable serpents of fire to writhe and light up the blackness.</p>
<p>Now the rain falls–now the wind is let loose with a terrible
shriek–now the lightning is so constant that the eyes burn, and the
thunder-claps merge into an awful roar, as did the 800 cannon at
Gettysburg. Crash! Crash! Crash! It is the cottonwood trees falling to
earth. Shriek! Shriek! Shriek! It is the Demon racing along the plain
and uprooting even the blades of grass. Shock! Shock! Shock! It is the
Fury flinging his fiery bolts into the bosom of the earth.– “The Demon
and the Fury.“ M. Quad.</p>
<p>Away up the gorge all diurnal fancies trooped into the wide liberties
of endless luminous vistas of azure sunlit mountains beneath the shining
azure heavens. The sky, looking down in deep blue placidities, only here
and there smote the water to azure emulations of its tint.– “In the
Stranger’s Country.“ Charles Egbert Craddock.</p>
<p>There was every indication of a dust-storm, though the sun still
shone brilliantly. The hot wind had become wild and rampant. It was
whipping up the sandy coating of the plain in every direction. High in
the air were seen whirling spires and cones of sand–a curious effect
against the deep-blue sky. Below, puffs of sand were breaking out of the
plain in every direction, as though the plain were alive with invisible
horsemen. These sandy cloudlets were instantly dissipated by the wind;
it was the larger clouds that were lifted whole into the air, and the
larger clouds of sand were becoming more and more the rule.</p>
<p>Alfred’s eye, quickly scanning the horizon, descried the roof of the
boundary-rider’s hut still gleaming in the sunlight. He remembered the
hut well. It could not be farther than four miles, if as much as that,
from this point of the track. He also knew these dust-storms of old;
Bindarra was notorious for them: Without thinking twice, Alfred put
