<h4 id="chapter-iii.">CHAPTER III.</h4>
<p>About an hour and a half before daylight we were bowling along
smoothly over the road–so smoothly that our cradle only rocked in a
gentle, lulling way, that was gradually soothing us to sleep, and
dulling our consciousness–when something gave away under us! We were
dimly aware of it, but indifferent to it. The coach stopped. We heard
the driver and conductor talking together outside, and rummaging for a
lantern, and swearing because they could not find it–but we had no
interest in whatever had happened, and it only added to our comfort to
think of those people out there at work in the murky night, and we snug
in our nest with the curtains drawn. But presently, by the sounds, there
seemed to be an examination going on, and then the driver’s voice
said:</p>
<p>“By George, the thoroughbrace is broke!“</p>
<p>This startled me broad awake–as an undefined sense of calamity is
always apt to do. I said to myself: “Now, a thoroughbrace is probably
part of a horse; and doubtless a vital part, too, from the dismay in the
driver’s voice. Leg, maybe–and yet how could he break his leg waltzing
along such a road as this? No, it can’t be his leg. That is impossible,
unless he was reaching for the driver. Now, what can be the
thoroughbrace of a horse, I wonder? Well, whatever comes, I shall not
air my ignorance in this crowd, anyway.“</p>
<p>Just then the conductor’s face appeared at a lifted curtain, and his
lantern glared in on us and our wall of mail matter. He said: “Gents,
you’ll have to turn out a spell. Thoroughbrace is broke.“</p>
<p>We climbed out into a chill drizzle, and felt ever so homeless and
dreary. When I found that the thing they called a “thoroughbrace“ was
the massive combination of belts and springs which the coach rocks
itself in, I said to the driver:</p>
<p>“I never saw a thoroughbrace used up like that, before, that I can
remember. How did it happen?“</p>
<p>“Why, it happened by trying to make one coach carry three days’ mail
–that’s how it happened,“ said he. “And right here is the very direction
which is wrote on all the newspaper-bags which was to be put out for the
Injuns for to keep ‘em quiet. It’s most uncommon lucky, becuz it’s so
nation dark I should ’a’ gone by unbeknowns if that air thoroughbrace
hadn’t broke.“</p>
<p>I knew that he was in labor with another of those winks of his,
though I could not see his face, because he was bent down at work; and
wishing him a safe delivery, I turned to and helped the rest get out the
mail-sacks. It made a great pyramid by the roadside when it was all out.
When they had mended the thoroughbrace we filled the two boots again,
but put no mail on top, and only half as much inside as there was
before. The conductor bent all the seat-backs down, and then filled the
coach just half full of mail-bags from end to end. We objected loudly to
this, for it left us no seats. But the conductor was wiser than we, and
said a bed was better than seats, and moreover, this plan would protect
his thoroughbraces. We never wanted any seats after that. The lazy bed
was infinitely preferable. I had many an exciting day, subsequently,
lying on it reading the statutes and the dictionary, and wondering how
the characters would turn out.</p>
<p>The conductor said he would send back a guard from the next station
to take charge of the abandoned mail-bags, and we drove on.</p>
<p>It was now just dawn; and as we stretched our cramped legs full
length on the mail sacks, and gazed out through the windows across the
wide wastes of greensward clad in cool, powdery mist, to where there was
an expectant look in the eastern horizon, our perfect enjoyment took the
form of a tranquil and contented ecstasy. The stage whirled along at a
spanking gait, the breeze flapping curtains and suspended coats in a
most exhilarating way; the cradle swayed and swung luxuriously, the
pattering of the horses’ hoofs, the cracking of the driver’s whip, and
his “Hi-yi! g’lang!“ were music; the spinning ground and the waltzing
trees appeared to give us a mute hurrah as we went by, and then slack up
and look after us with interest, or envy, or something; and as we lay
and smoked the pipe of peace and compared all this luxury with the years
of tiresome city life that had gone before it, we felt that there was
only one complete and satisfying happiness in the world, and we had
found it.</p>
<p>After breakfast, at some station whose name I have forgotten, we
three climbed up on the seat behind the driver, and let the conductor
have our bed for a nap. And by and by, when the sun made me drowsy, I
lay down on my face on top of the coach, grasping the slender iron
railing, and slept for an hour or more. That will give one an
appreciable idea of those matchless roads. Instinct will make a sleeping
man grip a fast hold of the railing when the stage jolts, but when it
only swings and sways, no grip is necessary. Overland drivers and
conductors used to sit in their places and sleep thirty or forty minutes
at a time, on good roads, while spinning along at the rate of eight or
ten miles an hour. I saw them do it, often. There was no danger about
it; a sleeping man will seize the irons in time when the coach jolts.
These men were hard worked, and it was not possible for them to stay
awake all the time.</p>
<p>By and by we passed through Marysville, and over the Big Blue and
Little Sandy; thence about a mile, and entered Nebraska. About a mile
further on, we came to the Big Sandy–one hundred and eighty miles from
St. Joseph.</p>
<p>As the sun was going down, we saw the first specimen of an animal
known familiarly over two thousand miles of mountain and desert–from
Kansas clear to the Pacific Ocean–as the “jackass rabbit.“ He is well
named. He is just like any other rabbit, except that he is from one
third to twice as large, has longer legs in proportion to his size, and
has the most preposterous ears that ever were mounted on any creature
but a jackass.</p>
<p>When he is sitting quiet, thinking about his sins, or is
absent-minded or unapprehensive of danger, his majestic ears project
above him conspicuously; but the breaking of a twig will scare him
nearly to death, and then he tilts his ears back gently and starts for
home. All you can see, then, for the next minute, is his long gray form
stretched out straight and “streaking it“ through the low sage-brush,
head erect, eyes right, and ears just canted a little to the rear, but
showing you where the animal is, all the time, the same as if he carried
a jib. Now and then he makes a marvelous spring with his long legs, high
over the stunted sage-brush, and scores a leap that would make a horse
envious. Presently he comes down to a long, graceful “lope,“ and shortly
he mysteriously disappears. He has crouched behind a sage-bush, and will
sit there and listen and tremble until you get within six feet of him,
when he will get under way again. But one must shoot at this creature
once, if he wishes to see him throw his heart into his heels, and do the
best he knows how. He is frightened clear through, now, and he lays his
long ears down on his back, straightens himself out like a yard-stick
every spring he makes, and scatters miles behind him with an easy
indifference that is enchanting.</p>
<p>Our party made this specimen “hump himself,“ as the conductor said.
The secretary started him with a shot from the Colt; I commenced
spitting at him with my weapon; and all in the same instant the old
“Allen’s“ whole broadside let go with a rattling crash, and it is not
putting it too strong to say that the rabbit was frantic! He dropped his
ears, set up his tail, and left for San Francisco at a speed which can
only be described as a flash and a vanish! Long after he was out of
sight we could hear him whiz.</p>
<p>I do not remember where we first came across “sage-brush,“ but as I
have been speaking of it I may as well describe it.</p>
<p>This is easily done, for if the reader can imagine a gnarled and
venerable live oak-tree reduced to a little shrub two feet-high, with
its rough bark, its foliage, its twisted boughs, all complete, he can
picture the “sage-brush“ exactly. Often, on lazy afternoons in the
mountains, I have lain on the ground with my face under a sage-bush, and
entertained myself with fancying that the gnats among its foliage were
liliputian birds, and that the ants marching and countermarching about
its base were liliputian flocks and herds, and myself some vast loafer
from Brobdignag waiting to catch a little citizen and eat him.</p>
<p>It is an imposing monarch of the forest in exquisite miniature, is
the “sage-brush.“ Its foliage is a grayish green, and gives that tint to
desert and mountain. It smells like our domestic sage, and “sage-tea“
made from it taste like the sage-tea which all boys are so well
acquainted with. The sage-brush is a singularly hardy plant, and grows
right in the midst of deep sand, and among barren rocks, where nothing
else in the vegetable world would try to grow, except “bunch-grass.“
–[“Bunch-grass“ grows on the bleak mountain-sides of Nevada and
neighboring territories, and offers excellent feed for stock, even in
the dead of winter, wherever the snow is blown aside and exposes it;
notwithstanding its unpromising home, bunch-grass is a better and more
nutritious diet for cattle and horses than almost any other hay or grass
that is known–so stock-men say.]–The sage-bushes grow from three to six
or seven feet apart, all over the mountains and deserts of the Far West,
clear to the borders of California. There is not a tree of any kind in
the deserts, for hundreds of miles–there is no vegetation at all in a
regular desert, except the sage-brush and its cousin the “greasewood,“
which is so much like the sage-brush that the difference amounts to
little. Camp-fires and hot suppers in the deserts would be impossible
but for the friendly sage-brush. Its trunk is as large as a boy’s wrist
(and from that up to a man’s arm), and its crooked branches are half as
large as its trunk–all good, sound, hard wood, very like oak.</p>
<p>When a party camps, the first thing to be done is to cut sage-brush;
and in a few minutes there is an opulent pile of it ready for use. A
hole a foot wide, two feet deep, and two feet long, is dug, and
sage-brush chopped up and burned in it till it is full to the brim with
glowing coals. Then the cooking begins, and there is no smoke, and
consequently no swearing. Such a fire will keep all night, with very
little replenishing; and it makes a very sociable camp-fire, and one
around which the most impossible reminiscences sound plausible,
instructive, and profoundly entertaining.</p>
<p>Sage-brush is very fair fuel, but as a vegetable it is a
distinguished failure. Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass
and his illegitimate child the mule. But their testimony to its
nutritiousness is worth nothing, for they will eat pine knots, or
anthracite coal, or brass filings, or lead pipe, or old bottles, or
anything that comes handy, and then go off looking as grateful as if
they had had oysters for dinner. Mules and donkeys and camels have
appetites that anything will relieve temporarily, but nothing
satisfy.</p>
<p>In Syria, once, at the head-waters of the Jordan, a camel took charge
of my overcoat while the tents were being pitched, and examined it with
a critical eye, all over, with as much interest as if he had an idea of
getting one made like it; and then, after he was done figuring on it as
an article of apparel, he began to contemplate it as an article of diet.
He put his foot on it, and lifted one of the sleeves out with his teeth,
and chewed and chewed at it, gradually taking it in, and all the while
opening and closing his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy, as if he
had never tasted anything as good as an overcoat before, in his life.
Then he smacked his lips once or twice, and reached after the other
sleeve. Next he tried the velvet collar, and smiled a smile of such
contentment that it was plain to see that he regarded that as the
daintiest thing about an overcoat. The tails went next, along with some
percussion caps and cough candy, and some fig-paste from Constantinople.
And then my newspaper correspondence dropped out, and he took a chance
in that –manuscript letters written for the home papers. But he was
treading on dangerous ground, now. He began to come across solid wisdom
in those documents that was rather weighty on his stomach; and
occasionally he would take a joke that would shake him up till it
loosened his teeth; it was getting to be perilous times with him, but he
held his grip with good courage and hopefully, till at last he began to
stumble on statements that not even a camel could swallow with impunity.
He began to gag and gasp, and his eyes to stand out, and his forelegs to
spread, and in about a quarter of a minute he fell over as stiff as a
carpenter’s work-bench, and died a death of indescribable agony. I went
and pulled the manuscript out of his mouth, and found that the sensitive
creature had choked to death on one of the mildest and gentlest
statements of fact that I ever laid before a trusting public.</p>
<p>I was about to say, when diverted from my subject, that occasionally
one finds sage-bushes five or six feet high, and with a spread of branch
and foliage in proportion, but two or two and a half feet is the usual
height.</p>
