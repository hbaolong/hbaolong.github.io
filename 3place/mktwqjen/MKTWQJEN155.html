<h4 id="chapter-x.">CHAPTER X.</h4>
<p>Two months had gone by and the Hawkins family were domiciled in
Hawkeye. Washington was at work in the real estate office again, and was
alternately in paradise or the other place just as it happened that
Louise was gracious to him or seemingly indifferent–because indifference
or preoccupation could mean nothing else than that she was thinking of
some other young person. Col. Sellers had asked him several times, to
dine with him, when he first returned to Hawkeye, but Washington, for no
particular reason, had not accepted. No particular reason except one
which he preferred to keep to himself–viz. that he could not bear to be
away from Louise. It occurred to him, now, that the Colonel had not
invited him lately–could he be offended? He resolved to go that very
day, and give the Colonel a pleasant surprise. It was a good idea;
especially as Louise had absented herself from breakfast that morning,
and torn his heart; he would tear hers, now, and let her see how it
felt.</p>
<p>The Sellers family were just starting to dinner when Washington burst
upon them with his surprise. For an instant the Colonel looked
nonplussed, and just a bit uncomfortable; and Mrs. Sellers looked
actually distressed; but the next moment the head of the house was
himself again, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>“All right, my boy, all right–always glad to see you–always glad to
hear your voice and take you by the hand. Don’t wait for special
invitations–that’s all nonsense among friends. Just come whenever you
can, and come as often as you can–the oftener the better. You can’t
please us any better than that, Washington; the little woman will tell
you so herself. We don’t pretend to style. Plain folks, you know–plain
folks. Just a plain family dinner, but such as it is, our friends are
always welcome, I reckon you know that yourself, Washington. Run along,
children, run along; Lafayette,–[**In those old days the average man
called his children after his most revered literary and historical
idols; consequently there was hardly a family, at least in the West, but
had a Washington in it–and also a Lafayette, a Franklin, and six or
eight sounding names from Byron, Scott, and the Bible, if the offspring
held out. To visit such a family, was to find one’s self confronted by a
congress made up of representatives of the imperial myths and the
majestic dead of all the ages. There was something thrilling about it,
to a stranger, not to say awe inspiring.]–stand off the cat’s tail,
child, can’t you see what you’re doing?–Come, come, come, Roderick Dhu,
it isn’t nice for little boys to hang onto young gentlemen’s coat tails
–but never mind him, Washington, he’s full of spirits and don’t mean any
harm. Children will be children, you know. Take the chair next to
Mrs. Sellers, Washington–tut, tut, Marie Antoinette, let your brother
have the fork if he wants it, you are bigger than he is.“</p>
<p>Washington contemplated the banquet, and wondered if he were in his
right mind. Was this the plain family dinner? And was it all present? It
was soon apparent that this was indeed the dinner: it was all on the
table: it consisted of abundance of clear, fresh water, and a basin of
raw turnips–nothing more.</p>
<p>Washington stole a glance at Mrs. Sellers’s face, and would have
given the world, the next moment, if he could have spared her that. The
poor woman’s face was crimson, and the tears stood in her eyes.
Washington did not know what to do. He wished he had never come there
and spied out this cruel poverty and brought pain to that poor little
lady’s heart and shame to her cheek; but he was there, and there was no
escape. Col. Sellers hitched back his coat sleeves airily from his
wrists as who should say “Now for solid enjoyment!“ seized a fork,
flourished it and began to harpoon turnips and deposit them in the
plates before him “Let me help you, Washington–Lafayette pass this plate
Washington–ah, well, well, my boy, things are looking pretty bright,
now, I tell you. Speculation–my! the whole atmosphere’s full of money. I
would’nt take three fortunes for one little operation I’ve got on hand
now–have anything from the casters? No? Well, you’re right, you’re
right. Some people like mustard with turnips, but–now there was Baron
Poniatowski –Lord, but that man did know how to live!–true Russian you
know, Russian to the back bone; I say to my wife, give me a Russian
every time, for a table comrade. The Baron used to say, ‘Take mustard,
Sellers, try the mustard,–a man can’t know what turnips are in
perfection without, mustard,’ but I always said, ’No, Baron, I’m a plain
man and I want my food plain–none of your embellishments for Beriah
Sellers–no made dishes for me! And it’s the best way–high living kills
more than it cures in this world, you can rest assured of that.–Yes
indeed, Washington, I’ve got one little operation on hand that–take some
more water–help yourself, won’t you?–help yourself, there’s plenty of
it. –You’ll find it pretty good, I guess. How does that fruit strike
you?“</p>
<p>Washington said he did not know that he had ever tasted better. He
did not add that he detested turnips even when they were cooked loathed
them in their natural state. No, he kept this to himself, and praised
the turnips to the peril of his soul.</p>
<p>“I thought you’d like them. Examine them–examine them–they’ll bear
it. See how perfectly firm and juicy they are–they can’t start any like
them in this part of the country, I can tell you. These are from New
Jersey –I imported them myself. They cost like sin, too; but lord bless
me, I go in for having the best of a thing, even if it does cost a
little more–it’s the best economy, in the long run. These are the Early
Malcolm–it’s a turnip that can’t be produced except in just one orchard,
and the supply never is up to the demand. Take some more water,
Washington–you can’t drink too much water with fruit–all the doctors say
that. The plague can’t come where this article is, my boy!“</p>
<p>“Plague? What plague?“</p>
<p>“What plague, indeed? Why the Asiatic plague that nearly depopulated
London a couple of centuries ago.“</p>
<p>“But how does that concern us? There is no plague here, I
reckon.“</p>
<p>“Sh! I’ve let it out! Well, never mind–just keep it to yourself.
Perhaps I oughtn’t said anything, but its bound to come out sooner or
later, so what is the odds? Old McDowells wouldn’t like me to–to –bother
it all, I’ll jest tell the whole thing and let it go. You see, I’ve been
down to St. Louis, and I happened to run across old Dr. McDowells–thinks
the world of me, does the doctor. He’s a man that keeps himself to
himself, and well he may, for he knows that he’s got a reputation that
covers the whole earth–he won’t condescend to open himself out to many
people, but lord bless you, he and I are just like brothers; he won’t
let me go to a hotel when I’m in the city–says I’m the only man that’s
company to him, and I don’t know but there’s some truth in it, too,
because although I never like to glorify myself and make a great to-do
over what I am or what I can do or what I know, I don’t mind saying here
among friends that I am better read up in most sciences, maybe, than the
general run of professional men in these days. Well, the other day he
let me into a little secret, strictly on the quiet, about this matter of
the plague.</p>
<p>“You see it’s booming right along in our direction–follows the Gulf
Stream, you know, just as all those epidemics do, and within three
months it will be just waltzing through this land like a whirlwind! And
whoever it touches can make his will and contract for the funeral. Well
you can’t cure it, you know, but you can prevent it. How? Turnips!
that’s it! Turnips and water! Nothing like it in the world, old
McDowells says, just fill yourself up two or three times a day, and you
can snap your fingers at the plague. Sh!–keep mum, but just you confine
yourself to that diet and you’re all right. I wouldn’t have old
McDowells know that I told about it for anything–he never would speak to
me again. Take some more water, Washington–the more water you drink, the
better. Here, let me give you some more of the turnips. No, no, no, now,
I insist. There, now. Absorb those. They’re, mighty sustaining–brim full
of nutriment–all the medical books say so. Just eat from four to seven
good-sized turnips at a meal, and drink from a pint and a half to a
quart of water, and then just sit around a couple of hours and let them
ferment. You’ll feel like a fighting cock next day.“</p>
<p>Fifteen or twenty minutes later the Colonel’s tongue was still
chattering away–he had piled up several future fortunes out of several
incipient “operations“ which he had blundered into within the past week,
and was now soaring along through some brilliant expectations born of
late promising experiments upon the lacking ingredient of the eye-water.
And at such a time Washington ought to have been a rapt and enthusiastic
listener, but he was not, for two matters disturbed his mind and
distracted his attention. One was, that he discovered, to his confusion
and shame, that in allowing himself to be helped a second time to the
turnips, he had robbed those hungry children. He had not needed the
dreadful “fruit,“ and had not wanted it; and when he saw the pathetic
sorrow in their faces when they asked for more and there was no more to
give them, he hated himself for his stupidity and pitied the famishing
young things with all his heart. The other matter that disturbed him was
the dire inflation that had begun in his stomach. It grew and grew, it
became more and more insupportable. Evidently the turnips were
“fermenting.“ He forced himself to sit still as long as he could, but
his anguish conquered him at last.</p>
<p>He rose in the midst of the Colonel’s talk and excused himself on the
plea of a previous engagement. The Colonel followed him to the door,
promising over and over again that he would use his influence to get
some of the Early Malcolms for him, and insisting that he should not be
such a stranger but come and take pot-luck with him every chance he got.
Washington was glad enough to get away and feel free again. He
immediately bent his steps toward home.</p>
<p>In bed he passed an hour that threatened to turn his hair gray, and
then a blessed calm settled down upon him that filled his heart with
gratitude. Weak and languid, he made shift to turn himself about and
seek rest and sleep; and as his soul hovered upon the brink of
unconciousness, he heaved a long, deep sigh, and said to himself that in
his heart he had cursed the Colonel’s preventive of rheumatism, before,
and now let the plague come if it must–he was done with preventives; if
ever any man beguiled him with turnips and water again, let him die the
death.</p>
<p>If he dreamed at all that night, no gossiping spirit disturbed his
visions to whisper in his ear of certain matters just then in bud in the
East, more than a thousand miles away that after the lapse of a few
years would develop influences which would profoundly affect the fate
and fortunes of the Hawkins family.</p>
