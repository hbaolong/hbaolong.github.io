<h4 id="chapter-xx.">CHAPTER XX.</h4>
<p>THE TRAGEDY OF THE MANOR-HOUSE</p>
<p>At midnight all was over, and we sat in the presence of four corpses.
We covered them with such rags as we could find, and started away,
fastening the door behind us. Their home must be these people’s grave,
for they could not have Christian burial, or be admitted to consecrated
ground. They were as dogs, wild beasts, lepers, and no soul that valued
its hope of eternal life would throw it away by meddling in any sort
with these rebuked and smitten outcasts.</p>
<p>We had not moved four steps when I caught a sound as of footsteps
upon gravel. My heart flew to my throat. We must not be seen coming from
that house. I plucked at the king’s robe and we drew back and took
shelter behind the corner of the cabin.</p>
<p>“Now we are safe,“ I said, “but it was a close call–so to speak. If
the night had been lighter he might have seen us, no doubt, he seemed to
be so near.“</p>
<p>“Mayhap it is but a beast and not a man at all.“</p>
<p>“True. But man or beast, it will be wise to stay here a minute and
let it get by and out of the way.“</p>
<p>“Hark! It cometh hither.“</p>
<p>True again. The step was coming toward us–straight toward the hut. It
must be a beast, then, and we might as well have saved our trepidation.
I was going to step out, but the king laid his hand upon my arm. There
was a moment of silence, then we heard a soft knock on the cabin door.
It made me shiver. Presently the knock was repeated, and then we heard
these words in a guarded voice:</p>
<p>“Mother! Father! Open–we have got free, and we bring news to pale
your cheeks but glad your hearts; and we may not tarry, but must fly!
And–but they answer not. Mother! father!–“</p>
<p>I drew the king toward the other end of the hut and whispered:</p>
<p>“Come–now we can get to the road.“</p>
<p>The king hesitated, was going to demur; but just then we heard the
door give way, and knew that those desolate men were in the presence of
their dead.</p>
<p>“Come, my liege! in a moment they will strike a light, and then will
follow that which it would break your heart to hear.“</p>
<p>He did not hesitate this time. The moment we were in the road I ran;
and after a moment he threw dignity aside and followed. I did not want
to think of what was happening in the hut–I couldn’t bear it; I wanted
to drive it out of my mind; so I struck into the first subject that lay
under that one in my mind:</p>
<p>“I have had the disease those people died of, and so have nothing to
fear; but if you have not had it also–“</p>
<p>He broke in upon me to say he was in trouble, and it was his
conscience that was troubling him:</p>
<p>“These young men have got free, they say–but <em>how</em>? It is not
likely that their lord hath set them free.“</p>
<p>“Oh, no, I make no doubt they escaped.“</p>
<p>“That is my trouble; I have a fear that this is so, and your
suspicion doth confirm it, you having the same fear.“</p>
<p>“I should not call it by that name though. I do suspect that they
escaped, but if they did, I am not sorry, certainly.“</p>
<p>“I am not sorry, I <em>think</em>–but–“</p>
<p>“What is it? What is there for one to be troubled about?“</p>
<p>“<em>If</em> they did escape, then are we bound in duty to lay hands
upon them and deliver them again to their lord; for it is not seemly
that one of his quality should suffer a so insolent and high-handed
outrage from persons of their base degree.“</p>
<p>There it was again. He could see only one side of it. He was born so,
educated so, his veins were full of ancestral blood that was rotten with
this sort of unconscious brutality, brought down by inheritance from a
long procession of hearts that had each done its share toward poisoning
the stream. To imprison these men without proof, and starve their
kindred, was no harm, for they were merely peasants and subject to the
will and pleasure of their lord, no matter what fearful form it might
take; but for these men to break out of unjust captivity was insult and
outrage, and a thing not to be countenanced by any conscientious person
who knew his duty to his sacred caste.</p>
<p>I worked more than half an hour before I got him to change the
subject–and even then an outside matter did it for me. This was a
something which caught our eyes as we struck the summit of a small
hill–a red glow, a good way off.</p>
<p>“That’s a fire,“ said I.</p>
<p>Fires interested me considerably, because I was getting a good deal
of an insurance business started, and was also training some horses and
building some steam fire-engines, with an eye to a paid fire department
by and by. The priests opposed both my fire and life insurance, on the
ground that it was an insolent attempt to hinder the decrees of God; and
if you pointed out that they did not hinder the decrees in the least,
but only modified the hard consequences of them if you took out policies
and had luck, they retorted that that was gambling against the decrees
of God, and was just as bad. So they managed to damage those industries
more or less, but I got even on my Accident business. As a rule, a
knight is a lummox, and some times even a labrick, and hence open to
pretty poor arguments when they come glibly from a superstition-monger,
but even <em>he</em> could see the practical side of a thing once in a
while; and so of late you couldn’t clean up a tournament and pile the
result without finding one of my accident-tickets in every helmet.</p>
<p>We stood there awhile, in the thick darkness and stillness, looking
toward the red blur in the distance, and trying to make out the meaning
of a far-away murmur that rose and fell fitfully on the night. Sometimes
it swelled up and for a moment seemed less remote; but when we were
hopefully expecting it to betray its cause and nature, it dulled and
sank again, carrying its mystery with it. We started down the hill in
its direction, and the winding road plunged us at once into almost solid
darkness–darkness that was packed and crammed in between two tall forest
walls. We groped along down for half a mile, perhaps, that murmur
growing more and more distinct all the time. The coming storm
threatening more and more, with now and then a little shiver of wind, a
faint show of lightning, and dull grumblings of distant thunder. I was
in the lead. I ran against something–a soft heavy something which gave,
slightly, to the impulse of my weight; at the same moment the lightning
glared out, and within a foot of my face was the writhing face of a man
who was hanging from the limb of a tree! That is, it seemed to be
writhing, but it was not. It was a grewsome sight. Straightway there was
an ear-splitting explosion of thunder, and the bottom of heaven fell
out; the rain poured down in a deluge. No matter, we must try to cut
this man down, on the chance that there might be life in him yet,
mustn’t we? The lightning came quick and sharp now, and the place was
alternately noonday and midnight. One moment the man would be hanging
before me in an intense light, and the next he was blotted out again in
the darkness. I told the king we must cut him down. The king at once
objected.</p>
<p>“If he hanged himself, he was willing to lose him property to his
lord; so let him be. If others hanged him, belike they had the right–let
him hang.“</p>
<p>“But–“</p>
<p>“But me no buts, but even leave him as he is. And for yet another
reason. When the lightning cometh again–there, look abroad.“</p>
<p>Two others hanging, within fifty yards of us!</p>
<p>“It is not weather meet for doing useless courtesies unto dead folk.
They are past thanking you. Come–it is unprofitable to tarry here.“</p>
<p>There was reason in what he said, so we moved on. Within the next
mile we counted six more hanging forms by the blaze of the lightning,
and altogether it was a grisly excursion. That murmur was a murmur no
longer, it was a roar; a roar of men’s voices. A man came flying by now,
dimly through the darkness, and other men chasing him. They disappeared.
Presently another case of the kind occurred, and then another and
another. Then a sudden turn of the road brought us in sight of that
fire–it was a large manor-house, and little or nothing was left of
it–and everywhere men were flying and other men raging after them in
pursuit.</p>
<p>I warned the king that this was not a safe place for strangers. We
would better get away from the light, until matters should improve. We
stepped back a little, and hid in the edge of the wood. From this
hiding-place we saw both men and women hunted by the mob. The fearful
work went on until nearly dawn. Then, the fire being out and the storm
spent, the voices and flying footsteps presently ceased, and darkness
and stillness reigned again.</p>
<p>We ventured out, and hurried cautiously away; and although we were
worn out and sleepy, we kept on until we had put this place some miles
behind us. Then we asked hospitality at the hut of a charcoal burner,
and got what was to be had. A woman was up and about, but the man was
still asleep, on a straw shake-down, on the clay floor. The woman seemed
uneasy until I explained that we were travelers and had lost our way and
been wandering in the woods all night. She became talkative, then, and
asked if we had heard of the terrible goings-on at the manor-house of
Abblasoure. Yes, we had heard of them, but what we wanted now was rest
and sleep. The king broke in:</p>
<p>“Sell us the house and take yourselves away, for we be perilous
company, being late come from people that died of the Spotted
Death.“</p>
<p>It was good of him, but unnecessary. One of the commonest decorations
of the nation was the waffle-iron face. I had early noticed that the
woman and her husband were both so decorated. She made us entirely
welcome, and had no fears; and plainly she was immensely impressed by
the king’s proposition; for, of course, it was a good deal of an event
in her life to run across a person of the king’s humble appearance who
was ready to buy a man’s house for the sake of a night’s lodging. It
gave her a large respect for us, and she strained the lean possibilities
of her hovel to the utmost to make us comfortable.</p>
<p>We slept till far into the afternoon, and then got up hungry enough
to make cotter fare quite palatable to the king, the more particularly
as it was scant in quantity. And also in variety; it consisted solely of
onions, salt, and the national black bread made out of horse-feed. The
woman told us about the affair of the evening before. At ten or eleven
at night, when everybody was in bed, the manor-house burst into flames.
The country-side swarmed to the rescue, and the family were saved, with
one exception, the master. He did not appear. Everybody was frantic over
this loss, and two brave yeomen sacrificed their lives in ransacking the
burning house seeking that valuable personage. But after a while he was
found–what was left of him–which was his corpse. It was in a copse three
hundred yards away, bound, gagged, stabbed in a dozen places.</p>
<p>Who had done this? Suspicion fell upon a humble family in the
neighborhood who had been lately treated with peculiar harshness by the
baron; and from these people the suspicion easily extended itself to
their relatives and familiars. A suspicion was enough; my lord’s
liveried retainers proclaimed an instant crusade against these people,
and were promptly joined by the community in general. The woman’s
husband had been active with the mob, and had not returned home until
nearly dawn. He was gone now to find out what the general result had
been. While we were still talking he came back from his quest. His
report was revolting enough. Eighteen persons hanged or butchered, and
two yeomen and thirteen prisoners lost in the fire.</p>
<p>“And how many prisoners were there altogether in the vaults?“</p>
<p>“Thirteen.“</p>
<p>“Then every one of them was lost?“</p>
<p>“Yes, all.“</p>
<p>“But the people arrived in time to save the family; how is it they
could save none of the prisoners?“</p>
<p>The man looked puzzled, and said:</p>
<p>“Would one unlock the vaults at such a time? Marry, some would have
escaped.“</p>
<p>“Then you mean that nobody <em>did</em> unlock them?“</p>
<p>“None went near them, either to lock or unlock. It standeth to reason
that the bolts were fast; wherefore it was only needful to establish a
watch, so that if any broke the bonds he might not escape, but be taken.
None were taken.“</p>
<p>“Natheless, three did escape,“ said the king, “and ye will do well to
publish it and set justice upon their track, for these murthered the
baron and fired the house.“</p>
<p>I was just expecting he would come out with that. For a moment the
man and his wife showed an eager interest in this news and an impatience
to go out and spread it; then a sudden something else betrayed itself in
their faces, and they began to ask questions. I answered the questions
myself, and narrowly watched the effects produced. I was soon satisfied
that the knowledge of who these three prisoners were had somehow changed
the atmosphere; that our hosts’ continued eagerness to go and spread the
news was now only pretended and not real. The king did not notice the
change, and I was glad of that. I worked the conversation around toward
other details of the night’s proceedings, and noted that these people
were relieved to have it take that direction.</p>
<p>The painful thing observable about all this business was the alacrity
with which this oppressed community had turned their cruel hands against
their own class in the interest of the common oppressor. This man and
woman seemed to feel that in a quarrel between a person of their own
class and his lord, it was the natural and proper and rightful thing for
that poor devil’s whole caste to side with the master and fight his
battle for him, without ever stopping to inquire into the rights or
wrongs of the matter. This man had been out helping to hang his
neighbors, and had done his work with zeal, and yet was aware that there
was nothing against them but a mere suspicion, with nothing back of it
describable as evidence, still neither he nor his wife seemed to see
anything horrible about it.</p>
<p>This was depressing–to a man with the dream of a republic in his
head. It reminded me of a time thirteen centuries away, when the “poor
whites“ of our South who were always despised and frequently insulted by
the slave-lords around them, and who owed their base condition simply to
the presence of slavery in their midst, were yet pusillanimously ready
to side with the slave-lords in all political moves for the upholding
and perpetuating of slavery, and did also finally shoulder their muskets
and pour out their lives in an effort to prevent the destruction of that
very institution which degraded them. And there was only one redeeming
feature connected with that pitiful piece of history; and that was, that
secretly the “poor white“ did detest the slave-lord, and did feel his
own shame. That feeling was not brought to the surface, but the fact
that it was there and could have been brought out, under favoring
circumstances, was something–in fact, it was enough; for it showed that
a man is at bottom a man, after all, even if it doesn’t show on the
outside.</p>
<p>Well, as it turned out, this charcoal burner was just the twin of the
Southern “poor white“ of the far future. The king presently showed
impatience, and said:</p>
<p>“An ye prattle here all the day, justice will miscarry. Think ye the
criminals will abide in their father’s house? They are fleeing, they are
not waiting. You should look to it that a party of horse be set upon
their track.“</p>
<p>The woman paled slightly, but quite perceptibly, and the man looked
flustered and irresolute. I said:</p>
<p>“Come, friend, I will walk a little way with you, and explain which
direction I think they would try to take. If they were merely resisters
of the gabelle or some kindred absurdity I would try to protect them
from capture; but when men murder a person of high degree and likewise
burn his house, that is another matter.“</p>
<p>The last remark was for the king–to quiet him. On the road the man
pulled his resolution together, and began the march with a steady gait,
but there was no eagerness in it. By and by I said:</p>
<p>“What relation were these men to you–cousins?“</p>
<p>He turned as white as his layer of charcoal would let him, and
stopped, trembling.</p>
<p>“Ah, my God, how know ye that?“</p>
<p>“I didn’t know it; it was a chance guess.“</p>
<p>“Poor lads, they are lost. And good lads they were, too.“</p>
<p>“Were you actually going yonder to tell on them?“</p>
<p>He didn’t quite know how to take that; but he said, hesitatingly:</p>
<p>“Ye-s.“</p>
<p>“Then I think you are a damned scoundrel!“</p>
<p>It made him as glad as if I had called him an angel.</p>
<p>“Say the good words again, brother! for surely ye mean that ye would
not betray me an I failed of my duty.“</p>
<p>“Duty? There is no duty in the matter, except the duty to keep still
and let those men get away. They’ve done a righteous deed.“</p>
<p>He looked pleased; pleased, and touched with apprehension at the same
time. He looked up and down the road to see that no one was coming, and
then said in a cautious voice:</p>
<p>“From what land come you, brother, that you speak such perilous
words, and seem not to be afraid?“</p>
<p>“They are not perilous words when spoken to one of my own caste, I
take it. You would not tell anybody I said them?“</p>
<p>“I? I would be drawn asunder by wild horses first.“</p>
<p>“Well, then, let me say my say. I have no fears of your repeating it.
I think devil’s work has been done last night upon those innocent poor
people. That old baron got only what he deserved. If I had my way, all
his kind should have the same luck.“</p>
<p>Fear and depression vanished from the man’s manner, and gratefulness
and a brave animation took their place:</p>
<p>“Even though you be a spy, and your words a trap for my undoing, yet
are they such refreshment that to hear them again and others like to
them, I would go to the gallows happy, as having had one good feast at
least in a starved life. And I will say my say now, and ye may report it
if ye be so minded. I helped to hang my neighbors for that it were peril
to my own life to show lack of zeal in the master’s cause; the others
helped for none other reason. All rejoice to-day that he is dead, but
all do go about seemingly sorrowing, and shedding the hypocrite’s tear,
for in that lies safety. I have said the words, I have said the words!
the only ones that have ever tasted good in my mouth, and the reward of
that taste is sufficient. Lead on, an ye will, be it even to the
scaffold, for I am ready.“</p>
<p>There it was, you see. A man is a man, at bottom. Whole ages of abuse
and oppression cannot crush the manhood clear out of him. Whoever thinks
it a mistake is himself mistaken. Yes, there is plenty good enough
material for a republic in the most degraded people that ever
existed–even the Russians; plenty of manhood in them–even in the
Germans–if one could but force it out of its timid and suspicious
privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was
set up and any nobility that ever supported it. We should see certain
things yet, let us hope and believe. First, a modified monarchy, till
Arthur’s days were done, then the destruction of the throne, nobility
abolished, every member of it bound out to some useful trade, universal
suffrage instituted, and the whole government placed in the hands of the
men and women of the nation there to remain. Yes, there was no occasion
to give up my dream yet a while.</p>
