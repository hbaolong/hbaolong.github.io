<h4 id="chapter-41-the-metropolis-of-the-south">Chapter 41 The
Metropolis of the South</h4>
<p>THE approaches to New Orleans were familiar; general aspects were
unchanged. When one goes flying through London along a railway propped
in the air on tall arches, he may inspect miles of upper bedrooms
through the open windows, but the lower half of the houses is under his
level and out of sight. Similarly, in high-river stage, in the New
Orleans region, the water is up to the top of the enclosing levee-rim,
the flat country behind it lies low–representing the bottom of a dish–
and as the boat swims along, high on the flood, one looks down upon the
houses and into the upper windows. There is nothing but that frail
breastwork of earth between the people and destruction.</p>
<p>The old brick salt-warehouses clustered at the upper end of the city
looked as they had always looked; warehouses which had had a kind of
Aladdin’s lamp experience, however, since I had seen them; for when the
war broke out the proprietor went to bed one night leaving them packed
with thousands of sacks of vulgar salt, worth a couple of dollars a
sack, and got up in the morning and found his mountain of salt turned
into a mountain of gold, so to speak, so suddenly and to so dizzy a
height had the war news sent up the price of the article.</p>
<p>The vast reach of plank wharves remained unchanged, and there were as
many ships as ever: but the long array of steamboats had vanished; not
altogether, of course, but not much of it was left.</p>
<p>The city itself had not changed–to the eye. It had greatly increased
in spread and population, but the look of the town was not altered. The
dust, waste-paper-littered, was still deep in the streets; the deep,
trough-like gutters alongside the curbstones were still half full of
reposeful water with a dusty surface; the sidewalks were still–in the
sugar and bacon region–encumbered by casks and barrels and hogsheads;
the great blocks of austerely plain commercial houses were as dusty-
looking as ever.</p>
<p>Canal Street was finer, and more attractive and stirring than
formerly, with its drifting crowds of people, its several processions of
hurrying street-cars, and–toward evening–its broad second-story verandas
crowded with gentlemen and ladies clothed according to the latest
mode.</p>
<p>Not that there is any ‘architecture’ in Canal Street: to speak in
broad, general terms, there is no architecture in New Orleans, except in
the cemeteries. It seems a strange thing to say of a wealthy, far-
seeing, and energetic city of a quarter of a million inhabitants, but it
is true. There is a huge granite U.S. Custom-house–costly enough,
genuine enough, but as a decoration it is inferior to a gasometer. It
looks like a state prison. But it was built before the war. Architecture
in America may be said to have been born since the war. New Orleans, I
believe, has had the good luck–and in a sense the bad luck– to have had
no great fire in late years. It must be so. If the opposite had been the
case, I think one would be able to tell the ‘burnt district’ by the
radical improvement in its architecture over the old forms. One can do
this in Boston and Chicago. The ‘burnt district’ of Boston was
commonplace before the fire; but now there is no commercial district in
any city in the world that can surpass it–or perhaps even rival it–in
beauty, elegance, and tastefulness.</p>
<p>However, New Orleans has begun–just this moment, as one may say. When
completed, the new Cotton Exchange will be a stately and beautiful
building; massive, substantial, full of architectural graces; no shams
or false pretenses or uglinesses about it anywhere. To the city, it will
be worth many times its cost, for it will breed its species. What has
been lacking hitherto, was a model to build toward; something to educate
eye and taste; a SUGGESTER, so to speak.</p>
<p>The city is well outfitted with progressive men–thinking, sagacious,
long-headed men. The contrast between the spirit of the city and the
city’s architecture is like the contrast between waking and sleep.
Apparently there is a ‘boom’ in everything but that one dead feature.
The water in the gutters used to be stagnant and slimy, and a potent
disease-breeder; but the gutters are flushed now, two or three times a
day, by powerful machinery; in many of the gutters the water never
stands still, but has a steady current. Other sanitary improvements have
been made; and with such effect that New Orleans claims to be (during
the long intervals between the occasional yellow-fever assaults) one of
the healthiest cities in the Union. There’s plenty of ice now for
everybody, manufactured in the town. It is a driving place commercially,
and has a great river, ocean, and railway business. At the date of our
visit, it was the best lighted city in the Union, electrically speaking.
The New Orleans electric lights were more numerous than those of New
York, and very much better. One had this modified noonday not only in
Canal and some neighboring chief streets, but all along a stretch of
five miles of river frontage. There are good clubs in the city
now–several of them but recently organized–and inviting modern-style
pleasure resorts at West End and Spanish Fort. The telephone is
everywhere. One of the most notable advances is in journalism. The
newspapers, as I remember them, were not a striking feature. Now they
are. Money is spent upon them with a free hand. They get the news, let
it cost what it may. The editorial work is not hack- grinding, but
literature. As an example of New Orleans journalistic achievement, it
may be mentioned that the ‘Times-Democrat’ of August 26, 1882, contained
a report of the year’s business of the towns of the Mississippi Valley,
from New Orleans all the way to St. Paul–two thousand miles. That issue
of the paper consisted of forty pages; seven columns to the page; two
hundred and eighty columns in all; fifteen hundred words to the column;
an aggregate of four hundred and twenty thousand words. That is to say,
not much short of three times as many words as there are in this book.
One may with sorrow contrast this with the architecture of New
Orleans.</p>
<p>I have been speaking of public architecture only. The domestic
article in New Orleans is reproachless, notwithstanding it remains as it
always was. All the dwellings are of wood–in the American part of the
town, I mean–and all have a comfortable look. Those in the wealthy
quarter are spacious; painted snow-white usually, and generally have
wide verandas, or double-verandas, supported by ornamental columns.
These mansions stand in the center of large grounds, and rise, garlanded
with roses, out of the midst of swelling masses of shining green foliage
and many- colored blossoms. No houses could well be in better harmony
with their surroundings, or more pleasing to the eye, or more home-like
and comfortable-looking.</p>
<p>One even becomes reconciled to the cistern presently; this is a
mighty cask, painted green, and sometimes a couple of stories high,
which is propped against the house-corner on stilts. There is a
mansion-and- brewery suggestion about the combination which seems very
incongruous at first. But the people cannot have wells, and so they take
rain-water. Neither can they conveniently have cellars, or
graves,{footnote [The Israelites are buried in graves–by permission, I
take it, not requirement; but none else, except the destitute, who are
buried at public expense. The graves are but three or four feet deep.]}
the town being built upon ‘made’ ground; so they do without both, and
few of the living complain, and none of the others.</p>
