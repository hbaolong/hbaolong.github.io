<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>Lakeside was a pleasant little town of five or six thousand
inhabitants, and a rather pretty one, too, as towns go in the Far West.
It had church accommodations for thirty-five thousand, which is the way
of the Far West and the South, where everybody is religious, and where
each of the Protestant sects is represented and has a plant of its own.
Rank was unknown in Lakeside–unconfessed, anyway; everybody knew
everybody and his dog, and a sociable friendliness was the prevailing
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Saladin Foster was book-keeper in the principal store, and the only
high-salaried man of his profession in Lakeside. He was thirty-five
years old, now; he had served that store for fourteen years; he had
begun in his marriage-week at four hundred dollars a year, and had
climbed steadily up, a hundred dollars a year, for four years; from that
time forth his wage had remained eight hundred–a handsome figure indeed,
and everybody conceded that he was worth it.</p>
<p>His wife, Electra, was a capable helpmeet, although–like himself –a
dreamer of dreams and a private dabbler in romance. The first thing she
did, after her marriage–child as she was, aged only nineteen –was to buy
an acre of ground on the edge of the town, and pay down the cash for
it–twenty-five dollars, all her fortune. Saladin had less, by fifteen.
She instituted a vegetable garden there, got it farmed on shares by the
nearest neighbor, and made it pay her a hundred per cent. a year. Out of
Saladin’s first year’s wage she put thirty dollars in the savings-bank,
sixty out of his second, a hundred out of his third, a hundred and fifty
out of his fourth. His wage went to eight hundred a year, then, and
meantime two children had arrived and increased the expenses, but she
banked two hundred a year from the salary, nevertheless, thenceforth.
When she had been married seven years she built and furnished a pretty
and comfortable two-thousand-dollar house in the midst of her
garden-acre, paid half of the money down and moved her family in. Seven
years later she was out of debt and had several hundred dollars out
earning its living.</p>
<p>Earning it by the rise in landed estate; for she had long ago bought
another acre or two and sold the most of it at a profit to pleasant
people who were willing to build, and would be good neighbors and
furnish a general comradeship for herself and her growing family. She
had an independent income from safe investments of about a hundred
dollars a year; her children were growing in years and grace; and she
was a pleased and happy woman. Happy in her husband, happy in her
children, and the husband and the children were happy in her. It is at
this point that this history begins.</p>
<p>The youngest girl, Clytemnestra–called Clytie for short –was eleven;
her sister, Gwendolen–called Gwen for short –was thirteen; nice girls,
and comely. The names betray the latent romance-tinge in the parental
blood, the parents’ names indicate that the tinge was an inheritance. It
was an affectionate family, hence all four of its members had pet names,
Saladin’s was a curious and unsexing one–Sally; and so was
Electra’s–Aleck. All day long Sally was a good and diligent book-keeper
and salesman; all day long Aleck was a good and faithful mother and
housewife, and thoughtful and calculating business woman; but in the
cozy living-room at night they put the plodding world away, and lived in
another and a fairer, reading romances to each other, dreaming dreams,
comrading with kings and princes and stately lords and ladies in the
flash and stir and splendor of noble palaces and grim and ancient
castles.</p>
