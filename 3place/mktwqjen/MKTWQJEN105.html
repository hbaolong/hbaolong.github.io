<h4 id="chapter-xxxix.">CHAPTER XXXIX.</h4>
<p>About seven o’clock one blistering hot morning–for it was now dead
summer time–Higbie and I took the boat and started on a voyage of
discovery to the two islands. We had often longed to do this, but had
been deterred by the fear of storms; for they were frequent, and severe
enough to capsize an ordinary row-boat like ours without great
difficulty–and once capsized, death would ensue in spite of the bravest
swimming, for that venomous water would eat a man’s eyes out like fire,
and burn him out inside, too, if he shipped a sea. It was called twelve
miles, straight out to the islands–a long pull and a warm one–but the
morning was so quiet and sunny, and the lake so smooth and glassy and
dead, that we could not resist the temptation. So we filled two large
tin canteens with water (since we were not acquainted with the locality
of the spring said to exist on the large island), and started. Higbie’s
brawny muscles gave the boat good speed, but by the time we reached our
destination we judged that we had pulled nearer fifteen miles than
twelve.</p>
<p>We landed on the big island and went ashore. We tried the water in
the canteens, now, and found that the sun had spoiled it; it was so
brackish that we could not drink it; so we poured it out and began a
search for the spring–for thirst augments fast as soon as it is apparent
that one has no means at hand of quenching it. The island was a long,
moderately high hill of ashes–nothing but gray ashes and pumice-stone,
in which we sunk to our knees at every step–and all around the top was a
forbidding wall of scorched and blasted rocks. When we reached the top
and got within the wall, we found simply a shallow, far-reaching basin,
carpeted with ashes, and here and there a patch of fine sand. In places,
picturesque jets of steam shot up out of crevices, giving evidence that
although this ancient crater had gone out of active business, there was
still some fire left in its furnaces. Close to one of these jets of
steam stood the only tree on the island–a small pine of most graceful
shape and most faultless symmetry; its color was a brilliant green, for
the steam drifted unceasingly through its branches and kept them always
moist. It contrasted strangely enough, did this vigorous and beautiful
outcast, with its dead and dismal surroundings. It was like a cheerful
spirit in a mourning household.</p>
<p>We hunted for the spring everywhere, traversing the full length of
the island (two or three miles), and crossing it twice–climbing
ash-hills patiently, and then sliding down the other side in a sitting
posture, plowing up smothering volumes of gray dust. But we found
nothing but solitude, ashes and a heart-breaking silence. Finally we
noticed that the wind had risen, and we forgot our thirst in a
solicitude of greater importance; for, the lake being quiet, we had not
taken pains about securing the boat. We hurried back to a point
overlooking our landing place, and then–but mere words cannot describe
our dismay–the boat was gone! The chances were that there was not
another boat on the entire lake. The situation was not comfortable–in
truth, to speak plainly, it was frightful. We were prisoners on a
desolate island, in aggravating proximity to friends who were for the
present helpless to aid us; and what was still more uncomfortable was
the reflection that we had neither food nor water. But presently we
sighted the boat. It was drifting along, leisurely, about fifty yards
from shore, tossing in a foamy sea. It drifted, and continued to drift,
but at the same safe distance from land, and we walked along abreast it
and waited for fortune to favor us. At the end of an hour it approached
a jutting cape, and Higbie ran ahead and posted himself on the utmost
verge and prepared for the assault. If we failed there, there was no
hope for us. It was driving gradually shoreward all the time, now; but
whether it was driving fast enough to make the connection or not was the
momentous question. When it got within thirty steps of Higbie I was so
excited that I fancied I could hear my own heart beat. When, a little
later, it dragged slowly along and seemed about to go by, only one
little yard out of reach, it seemed as if my heart stood still; and when
it was exactly abreast him and began to widen away, and he still
standing like a watching statue, I knew my heart did stop. But when he
gave a great spring, the next instant, and lit fairly in the stern, I
discharged a war-whoop that woke the solitudes!</p>
<p>But it dulled my enthusiasm, presently, when he told me he had not
been caring whether the boat came within jumping distance or not, so
that it passed within eight or ten yards of him, for he had made up his
mind to shut his eyes and mouth and swim that trifling distance.
Imbecile that I was, I had not thought of that. It was only a long swim
that could be fatal.</p>
<p>The sea was running high and the storm increasing. It was growing
late, too–three or four in the afternoon. Whether to venture toward the
mainland or not, was a question of some moment. But we were so
distressed by thirst that we decide to try it, and so Higbie fell to
work and I took the steering-oar. When we had pulled a mile,
laboriously, we were evidently in serious peril, for the storm had
greatly augmented; the billows ran very high and were capped with
foaming crests, the heavens were hung with black, and the wind blew with
great fury. We would have gone back, now, but we did not dare to turn
the boat around, because as soon as she got in the trough of the sea she
would upset, of course. Our only hope lay in keeping her head-on to the
seas. It was hard work to do this, she plunged so, and so beat and
belabored the billows with her rising and falling bows. Now and then one
of Higbie’s oars would trip on the top of a wave, and the other one
would snatch the boat half around in spite of my cumbersome steering
apparatus. We were drenched by the sprays constantly, and the boat
occasionally shipped water. By and by, powerful as my comrade was, his
great exertions began to tell on him, and he was anxious that I should
change places with him till he could rest a little. But I told him this
was impossible; for if the steering oar were dropped a moment while we
changed, the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea, capsize,
and in less than five minutes we would have a hundred gallons of
soap-suds in us and be eaten up so quickly that we could not even be
present at our own inquest.</p>
<p>But things cannot last always. Just as the darkness shut down we came
booming into port, head on. Higbie dropped his oars to hurrah–I dropped
mine to help–the sea gave the boat a twist, and over she went!</p>
<p>The agony that alkali water inflicts on bruises, chafes and blistered
hands, is unspeakable, and nothing but greasing all over will modify it
–but we ate, drank and slept well, that night, notwithstanding.</p>
<p>In speaking of the peculiarities of Mono Lake, I ought to have
mentioned that at intervals all around its shores stand picturesque
turret-looking masses and clusters of a whitish, coarse-grained rock
that resembles inferior mortar dried hard; and if one breaks off
fragments of this rock he will find perfectly shaped and thoroughly
petrified gulls’ eggs deeply imbedded in the mass. How did they get
there? I simply state the fact –for it is a fact–and leave the
geological reader to crack the nut at his leisure and solve the problem
after his own fashion.</p>
<p>At the end of a week we adjourned to the Sierras on a fishing
excursion, and spent several days in camp under snowy Castle Peak, and
fished successfully for trout in a bright, miniature lake whose surface
was between ten and eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea;
cooling ourselves during the hot August noons by sitting on snow banks
ten feet deep, under whose sheltering edges fine grass and dainty
flowers flourished luxuriously; and at night entertaining ourselves by
almost freezing to death. Then we returned to Mono Lake, and finding
that the cement excitement was over for the present, packed up and went
back to Esmeralda. Mr. Ballou reconnoitred awhile, and not liking the
prospect, set out alone for Humboldt.</p>
<p>About this time occurred a little incident which has always had a
sort of interest to me, from the fact that it came so near “instigating“
my funeral. At a time when an Indian attack had been expected, the
citizens hid their gunpowder where it would be safe and yet convenient
to hand when wanted. A neighbor of ours hid six cans of rifle powder in
the bake-oven of an old discarded cooking stove which stood on the open
ground near a frame out-house or shed, and from and after that day never
thought of it again. We hired a half-tamed Indian to do some washing for
us, and he took up quarters under the shed with his tub. The ancient
stove reposed within six feet of him, and before his face. Finally it
occurred to him that hot water would be better than cold, and he went
out and fired up under that forgotten powder magazine and set on a
kettle of water. Then he returned to his tub.</p>
<p>I entered the shed presently and threw down some more clothes, and
was about to speak to him when the stove blew up with a prodigious
crash, and disappeared, leaving not a splinter behind. Fragments of it
fell in the streets full two hundred yards away. Nearly a third of the
shed roof over our heads was destroyed, and one of the stove lids, after
cutting a small stanchion half in two in front of the Indian, whizzed
between us and drove partly through the weather-boarding beyond. I was
as white as a sheet and as weak as a kitten and speechless. But the
Indian betrayed no trepidation, no distress, not even discomfort. He
simply stopped washing, leaned forward and surveyed the clean, blank
ground a moment, and then remarked:</p>
<p>“Mph! Dam stove heap gone!“–and resumed his scrubbing as placidly as
if it were an entirely customary thing for a stove to do. I will
explain, that “heap“ is “Injun-English“ for “very much.“ The reader will
perceive the exhaustive expressiveness of it in the present
instance.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XL. I now come to a curious episode–the most curious, I
think, that had yet accented my slothful, valueless, heedless career.
Out of a hillside toward the upper end of the town, projected a wall of
reddish looking quartz-croppings, the exposed comb of a silver-bearing
ledge that extended deep down into the earth, of course. It was owned by
a company entitled the “Wide West.“ There was a shaft sixty or seventy
feet deep on the under side of the croppings, and everybody was
acquainted with the rock that came from it–and tolerably rich rock it
was, too, but nothing extraordinary. I will remark here, that although
to the inexperienced stranger all the quartz of a particular “district“
looks about alike, an old resident of the camp can take a glance at a
mixed pile of rock, separate the fragments and tell you which mine each
came from, as easily as a confectioner can separate and classify the
various kinds and qualities of candy in a mixed heap of the article.</p>
<p>All at once the town was thrown into a state of extraordinary
excitement. In mining parlance the Wide West had “struck it rich!“
Everybody went to see the new developments, and for some days there was
such a crowd of people about the Wide West shaft that a stranger would
have supposed there was a mass meeting in session there. No other topic
was discussed but the rich strike, and nobody thought or dreamed about
anything else. Every man brought away a specimen, ground it up in a hand
mortar, washed it out in his horn spoon, and glared speechless upon the
marvelous result. It was not hard rock, but black, decomposed stuff
which could be crumbled in the hand like a baked potato, and when spread
out on a paper exhibited a thick sprinkling of gold and particles of
“native“ silver. Higbie brought a handful to the cabin, and when he had
washed it out his amazement was beyond description. Wide West stock
soared skywards. It was said that repeated offers had been made for it
at a thousand dollars a foot, and promptly refused. We have all had the
“blues“–the mere sky-blues–but mine were indigo, now–because I did not
own in the Wide West. The world seemed hollow to me, and existence a
grief. I lost my appetite, and ceased to take an interest in anything.
Still I had to stay, and listen to other people’s rejoicings, because I
had no money to get out of the camp with.</p>
<p>The Wide West company put a stop to the carrying away of “specimens,“
and well they might, for every handful of the ore was worth a sun of
some consequence. To show the exceeding value of the ore, I will remark
that a sixteen-hundred-pounds parcel of it was sold, just as it lay, at
the mouth of the shaft, at one dollar a pound; and the man who bought it
“packed“ it on mules a hundred and fifty or two hundred miles, over the
mountains, to San Francisco, satisfied that it would yield at a rate
that would richly compensate him for his trouble. The Wide West people
also commanded their foreman to refuse any but their own operatives
permission to enter the mine at any time or for any purpose. I kept up
my “blue“ meditations and Higbie kept up a deal of thinking, too, but of
a different sort. He puzzled over the “rock,“ examined it with a glass,
inspected it in different lights and from different points of view, and
after each experiment delivered himself, in soliloquy, of one and the
same unvarying opinion in the same unvarying formula:</p>
<p>“It is not Wide West rock!“</p>
<p>He said once or twice that he meant to have a look into the Wide West
shaft if he got shot for it. I was wretched, and did not care whether he
got a look into it or not. He failed that day, and tried again at night;
failed again; got up at dawn and tried, and failed again. Then he lay in
ambush in the sage brush hour after hour, waiting for the two or three
hands to adjourn to the shade of a boulder for dinner; made a start
once, but was premature–one of the men came back for something; tried it
again, but when almost at the mouth of the shaft, another of the men
rose up from behind the boulder as if to reconnoitre, and he dropped on
the ground and lay quiet; presently he crawled on his hands and knees to
the mouth of the shaft, gave a quick glance around, then seized the rope
and slid down the shaft.</p>
<p>He disappeared in the gloom of a “side drift“ just as a head appeared
in the mouth of the shaft and somebody shouted “Hello!“–which he did not
answer. He was not disturbed any more. An hour later he entered the
cabin, hot, red, and ready to burst with smothered excitement, and
exclaimed in a stage whisper:</p>
<p>“I knew it! We are rich! IT’S A BLIND LEAD!“</p>
<p>I thought the very earth reeled under me. Doubt–conviction–doubt
again–exultation–hope, amazement, belief, unbelief–every emotion
imaginable swept in wild procession through my heart and brain, and I
could not speak a word. After a moment or two of this mental fury, I
shook myself to rights, and said:</p>
<p>“Say it again!“</p>
<p>“It’s blind lead!“</p>
<p>“Cal, let’s–let’s burn the house–or kill somebody! Let’s get out
where there’s room to hurrah! But what is the use? It is a hundred times
too good to be true.“</p>
<p>“It’s a blind lead, for a million!–hanging wall–foot wall–clay
casings–everything complete!“ He swung his hat and gave three cheers,
and I cast doubt to the winds and chimed in with a will. For I was worth
a million dollars, and did not care “whether school kept or not!“</p>
<p>But perhaps I ought to explain. A “blind lead“ is a lead or ledge
that does not “crop out“ above the surface. A miner does not know where
to look for such leads, but they are often stumbled upon by accident in
the course of driving a tunnel or sinking a shaft. Higbie knew the Wide
West rock perfectly well, and the more he had examined the new
developments the more he was satisfied that the ore could not have come
from the Wide West vein. And so had it occurred to him alone, of all the
camp, that there was a blind lead down in the shaft, and that even the
Wide West people themselves did not suspect it. He was right. When he
went down the shaft, he found that the blind lead held its independent
way through the Wide West vein, cutting it diagonally, and that it was
enclosed in its own well-defined casing-rocks and clay. Hence it was
public property. Both leads being perfectly well defined, it was easy
for any miner to see which one belonged to the Wide West and which did
not.</p>
<p>We thought it well to have a strong friend, and therefore we brought
the foreman of the Wide West to our cabin that night and revealed the
great surprise to him. Higbie said:</p>
<p>“We are going to take possession of this blind lead, record it and
establish ownership, and then forbid the Wide West company to take out
any more of the rock. You cannot help your company in this matter
–nobody can help them. I will go into the shaft with you and prove to
your entire satisfaction that it is a blind lead. Now we propose to take
you in with us, and claim the blind lead in our three names. What do you
say?“</p>
<p>What could a man say who had an opportunity to simply stretch forth
his hand and take possession of a fortune without risk of any kind and
without wronging any one or attaching the least taint of dishonor to his
name? He could only say, “Agreed.“</p>
<p>The notice was put up that night, and duly spread upon the recorder’s
books before ten o’clock. We claimed two hundred feet each–six hundred
feet in all–the smallest and compactest organization in the district,
and the easiest to manage.</p>
<p>No one can be so thoughtless as to suppose that we slept, that night.
Higbie and I went to bed at midnight, but it was only to lie broad awake
and think, dream, scheme. The floorless, tumble-down cabin was a palace,
the ragged gray blankets silk, the furniture rosewood and mahogany. Each
new splendor that burst out of my visions of the future whirled me
bodily over in bed or jerked me to a sitting posture just as if an
electric battery had been applied to me. We shot fragments of
conversation back and forth at each other. Once Higbie said:</p>
<p>“When are you going home–to the States?“</p>
<p>“To-morrow!“–with an evolution or two, ending with a sitting
position. “Well–no–but next month, at furthest.“</p>
<p>“We’ll go in the same steamer.“</p>
<p>“Agreed.“</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>“Steamer of the 10th?“</p>
<p>“Yes. No, the 1st.“</p>
<p>“All right.“</p>
<p>Another pause.</p>
<p>“Where are you going to live?“ said Higbie.</p>
<p>“San Francisco.“</p>
<p>“That’s me!“</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“Too high–too much climbing“–from Higbie.</p>
<p>“What is?“</p>
<p>“I was thinking of Russian Hill–building a house up there.“</p>
<p>“Too much climbing? Shan’t you keep a carriage?“</p>
<p>“Of course. I forgot that.“</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“Cal., what kind of a house are you going to build?“</p>
<p>“I was thinking about that. Three-story and an attic.“</p>
<p>“But what kind?“</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t hardly know. Brick, I suppose.“</p>
<p>“Brick–bosh.“</p>
<p>“Why? What is your idea?“</p>
<p>“Brown stone front–French plate glass–billiard-room off the
dining-room–statuary and paintings–shrubbery and two-acre grass plat
–greenhouse–iron dog on the front stoop–gray horses–landau, and a
coachman with a bug on his hat!“</p>
<p>“By George!“</p>
<p>A long pause.</p>
<p>“Cal., when are you going to Europe?“</p>
<p>“Well–I hadn’t thought of that. When are you?“</p>
<p>“In the Spring.“</p>
<p>“Going to be gone all summer?“</p>
<p>“All summer! I shall remain there three years.“</p>
<p>“No–but are you in earnest?“</p>
<p>“Indeed I am.“</p>
<p>“I will go along too.“</p>
<p>“Why of course you will.“</p>
<p>“What part of Europe shall you go to?“</p>
<p>“All parts. France, England, Germany–Spain, Italy, Switzerland,
Syria, Greece, Palestine, Arabia, Persia, Egypt–all
over–everywhere.“</p>
<p>“I’m agreed.“</p>
<p>“All right.“</p>
<p>“Won’t it be a swell trip!“</p>
<p>“We’ll spend forty or fifty thousand dollars trying to make it one,
anyway.“</p>
<p>Another long pause.</p>
<p>“Higbie, we owe the butcher six dollars, and he has been threatening
to stop our–“</p>
<p>“Hang the butcher!“</p>
<p>“Amen.“</p>
<p>And so it went on. By three o’clock we found it was no use, and so we
got up and played cribbage and smoked pipes till sunrise. It was my week
to cook. I always hated cooking–now, I abhorred it.</p>
<p>The news was all over town. The former excitement was great–this one
was greater still. I walked the streets serene and happy. Higbie said
the foreman had been offered two hundred thousand dollars for his third
of the mine. I said I would like to see myself selling for any such
price. My ideas were lofty. My figure was a million. Still, I honestly
believe that if I had been offered it, it would have had no other effect
than to make me hold off for more.</p>
<p>I found abundant enjoyment in being rich. A man offered me a
three-hundred-dollar horse, and wanted to take my simple, unendorsed
note for it. That brought the most realizing sense I had yet had that I
was actually rich, beyond shadow of doubt. It was followed by numerous
other evidences of a similar nature–among which I may mention the fact
of the butcher leaving us a double supply of meat and saying nothing
about money.</p>
<p>By the laws of the district, the “locators“ or claimants of a ledge
were obliged to do a fair and reasonable amount of work on their new
property within ten days after the date of the location, or the property
was forfeited, and anybody could go and seize it that chose. So we
determined to go to work the next day. About the middle of the
afternoon, as I was coming out of the post office, I met a Mr. Gardiner,
who told me that Capt. John Nye was lying dangerously ill at his place
(the “Nine-Mile Ranch“), and that he and his wife were not able to give
him nearly as much care and attention as his case demanded. I said if he
would wait for me a moment, I would go down and help in the sick room. I
ran to the cabin to tell Higbie. He was not there, but I left a note on
the table for him, and a few minutes later I left town in Gardiner’s
wagon.</p>
