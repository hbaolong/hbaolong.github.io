1856-61. KEOKUK, AND THE RIVER. END OF PILOTING</h4>
<p>There comes a period now of nearly four years, when Samuel Clemens
was either a poor correspondent or his letters have not been preserved.
Only two from this time have survived–happily of intimate biographical
importance.</p>
<p>Young Clemens had not remained in Muscatine. His brother had no
inducements to offer, and he presently returned to St. Louis, where he
worked as a compositor on the Evening News until the following spring,
rooming with a young man named Burrough, a journeyman chair-maker with a
taste for the English classics. Orion Clemens, meantime, on a trip to
Keokuk, had casually married there, and a little later removed his
office to that city. He did not move the paper; perhaps it did not seem
worth while, and in Keokuk he confined himself to commercial printing.
The Ben Franklin Book and Job Office started with fair prospects. Henry
Clemens and a boy named Dick Hingham were the assistants, and somewhat
later, when brother Sam came up from St. Louis on a visit, an offer of
five dollars a week and board induced him to remain. Later, when it
became increasingly difficult to pay the five dollars, Orion took his
brother into partnership, which perhaps relieved the financial stress,
though the office methods would seem to have left something to be
desired. It is about at this point that the first of the two letters
mentioned was written. The writer addressed it to his mother and
sister–Jane Clemens having by this time taken up her home with her
daughter, Mrs. Moffett.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>KEOKUK, Iowa, June 10th, 1856. MY DEAR MOTHER andandandand SISTER,–I
have nothing to write. Everything is going on well. The Directory is
coming on finely. I have to work on it occasionally, which I don’t like
a particle I don’t like to work at too many things at once. They take
Henry and Dick away from me too. Before we commenced the Directory, I
could tell before breakfast just how much work could be done during the
day, and manage accordingly–but now, they throw all my plans into
disorder by taking my hands away from their work. I have nothing to do
with the book–if I did I would have the two book hands do more work than
they do, or else I would drop it. It is not a mere supposition that they
do not work fast enough–I know it; for yesterday the two book hands were
at work all day, Henry and Dick all the afternoon, on the
advertisements, and they set up five pages and a half –and I set up two
pages and a quarter of the same matter after supper, night before last,
and I don’t work fast on such things. They are either excessively slow
motioned or very lazy. I am not getting along well with the job work. I
can’t work blindly–without system. I gave Dick a job yesterday, which I
calculated he would set in two hours and I could work off in three, and
therefore just finish it by supper time, but he was transferred to the
Directory, and the job, promised this morning, remains untouched.
Through all the great pressure of job work lately, I never before failed
in a promise of the kind. Your Son SAM Excuse brevity this is my 3rd
letter to-night.</p>
<p>Samuel Clemens was never celebrated for his patience; we may imagine
that the disorder of the office tried his nerves. He seems, on the
whole, however, to have been rather happy in Keokuk. There were plenty
of young people there, and he was a favorite among them. But he had
grown dissatisfied, and when one day some weeks later there fell into
His hands an account of the riches of the newly explored regions of the
upper Amazon, he promptly decided to find his fortune at the headwaters
of the great South-American river. The second letter reports this
momentous decision. It was written to Henry Clemens, who was temporarily
absent-probably in Hannibal.</p>
<p>To Henry Clemens:</p>
<p>KEOKUK, August 5th, ’56. MY DEAR BROTHER,–….. Ward and I held a long
consultation, Sunday morning, and the result was that we two have
determined to start to Brazil, if possible, in six weeks from now, in
order to look carefully into matters there and report to Dr. Martin in
time for him to follow on the first of March. We propose going via New
York. Now, between you and I and the fence you must say nothing about
this to Orion, for he thinks that Ward is to go clear through alone, and
that I am to stop at New York or New Orleans until he reports. But that
don’t suit me. My confidence in human nature does not extend quite that
far. I won’t depend upon Ward’s judgment, or anybody’s else–I want to
see with my own eyes, and form my own opinion. But you know what Orion
is. When he gets a notion into his head, and more especially if it is an
erroneous one, the Devil can’t get it out again. So I know better than
to combat his arguments long, but apparently yielded, inwardly
determined to go clear through. Ma knows my determination, but even she
counsels me to keep it from Orion. She says I can treat him as I did her
when I started to St. Louis and went to New York–I can start to New York
and go to South America! Although Orion talks grandly about furnishing
me with fifty or a hundred dollars in six weeks, I could not depend upon
him for ten dollars, so I have “feelers“ out in several directions, and
have already asked for a hundred dollars from one source (keep it to
yourself.) I will lay on my oars for awhile, and see how the wind sets,
when I may probably try to get more. Mrs. Creel is a great friend of
mine, and has some influence with Ma and Orion, though I reckon they
would not acknowledge it. I am going up there tomorrow, to press her
into my service. I shall take care that Ma and Orion are plentifully
supplied with South American books. They have Herndon’s Report now. Ward
and the Dr. and myself will hold a grand consultation tonight at the
office. We have agreed that no more shall be admitted into our
company.</p>
<p>I believe the Guards went down to Quincy today to escort our first
locomotive home. Write soon. Your Brother, SAM.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with the life of Mark Twain know that none of the
would-be adventurers found their way to the Amazon: His two associates
gave up the plan, probably for lack of means. Young Clemens himself
found a fifty-dollar bill one bleak November day blowing along the
streets of Keokuk, and after duly advertising his find without result,
set out for the Amazon, by way of Cincinnati and New Orleans.</p>
<p>“I advertised the find and left for the Amazon the same day,“ he once
declared, a statement which we may take with a literary discount.</p>
<p>He remained in Cincinnati that winter (1856-57) working at his trade.
No letters have been preserved from that time, except two that were sent
to a Keokuk weekly, the Saturday Post, and as these were written for
publication, and are rather a poor attempt at burlesque humor–their
chief feature being a pretended illiteracy –they would seem to bear no
relation to this collection. He roomed that winter with a rugged,
self-educated Scotchman–a mechanic, but a man of books and philosophies,
who left an impress on Mark Twain’s mental life.</p>
<p>In April he took up once more the journey toward South America, but
presently forgot the Amazon altogether in the new career that opened to
him. All through his boyhood and youth Samuel Clemens had wanted to be a
pilot. Now came the long-deferred opportunity. On the little Cincinnati
steamer, the Paul Jones, there was a pilot named Horace Bixby. Young
Clemens idling in the pilot-house was one morning seized with the old
ambition, and laid siege to Bixby to teach him the river. The terms
finally agreed upon specified a fee to Bixby of five hundred dollars,
one hundred down, the balance when the pupil had completed the course
and was earning money. But all this has been told in full elsewhere, and
is only summarized here because the letters fail to complete the
story.</p>
<p>Bixby soon made some trips up the Missouri River, and in his absence
turned his apprentice, or “cub,“ over to other pilots, such being the
river custom. Young Clemens, in love with the life, and a favorite with
his superiors, had a happy time until he came under a pilot named Brown.
Brown was illiterate and tyrannical, and from the beginning of their
association pilot and apprentice disliked each other cordially.</p>
<p>It is at this point that the letters begin once more–the first having
been written when young Clemens, now twenty-two years old, had been on
the river nearly a year. Life with Brown, of course, was not all sorrow,
and in this letter we find some of the fierce joy of adventure which in
those days Samuel Clemens loved.</p>
<p>To Onion Clemens and Wife, in Keokuk, Iowa:</p>
<p>SAINT LOUIS, March 9th, 1858. DEAR BROTHER AND SISTER,–I must take
advantage of the opportunity now presented to write you, but I shall
necessarily be dull, as I feel uncommonly stupid. We have had a hard
trip this time. Left Saint Louis three weeks ago on the Pennsylvania.
The weather was very cold, and the ice running densely. We got 15 miles
below town, landed the boat, and then one pilot. Second Mate and four
deck hands took the sounding boat and shoved out in the ice to hunt the
channel. They failed to find it, and the ice drifted them ashore. The
pilot left the men with the boat and walked back to us, a mile and a
half. Then the other pilot and myself, with a larger crew of men started
out and met with the same fate. We drifted ashore just below the other
boat. Then the fun commenced. We made fast a line 20 fathoms long, to
the bow of the yawl, and put the men (both crews) to it like horses, on
the shore. Brown, the pilot, stood in the bow, with an oar, to keep her
head out, and I took the tiller. We would start the men, and all would
go well till the yawl would bring up on a heavy cake of ice, and then
the men would drop like so many ten-pins, while Brown assumed the
horizontal in the bottom of the boat. After an hour’s hard work we got
back, with ice half an inch thick on the oars. Sent back and warped up
the other yawl, and then George (the first mentioned pilot,) and myself,
took a double crew of fresh men and tried it again. This time we found
the channel in less than half an hour, and landed on an island till the
Pennsylvania came along and took us off. The next day was colder still.
I was out in the yawl twice, and then we got through, but the infernal
steamboat came near running over us. We went ten miles further, landed,
and George and I cleared out again–found the channel first trial, but
got caught in the gorge and drifted helplessly down the river. The Ocean
Spray came along and started into the ice after us, but although she
didn’t succeed in her kind intention of taking us aboard, her waves
washed us out, and that was all we wanted. We landed on an island, built
a big fire and waited for the boat. She started, and ran aground! It
commenced raining and sleeting, and a very interesting time we had on
that barren sandbar for the next four hours, when the boat got off and
took us aboard. The next day was terribly cold. We sounded Hat Island,
warped up around a bar and sounded again –but in order to understand our
situation you will have to read Dr. Kane. It would have been impossible
to get back to the boat. But the Maria Denning was aground at the head
of the island–they hailed us–we ran alongside and they hoisted us in and
thawed us out. We had then been out in the yawl from 4 o’clock in the
morning till half past 9 without being near a fire. There was a thick
coating of ice over men, yawl, ropes and everything else, and we looked
like rock-candy statuary. We got to Saint Louis this morning, after an
absence of 3 weeks–that boat generally makes the trip in 2.</p>
<p>Henry was doing little or nothing here, and I sent him to our clerk
to work his way for a trip, by measuring wood piles, counting coal
boxes, and other clerkly duties, which he performed satisfactorily. He
may go down with us again, for I expect he likes our bill of fare better
than that of his boarding house.</p>
<p>I got your letter at Memphis as I went down. That is the best place
to write me at. The post office here is always out of my route, somehow
or other. Remember the direction: “S.L.C., Steamer Pennsylvania Care
Duval andandandand Algeo, Wharfboat, Memphis.“ I cannot correspond with
a paper, because when one is learning the river, he is not allowed to do
or think about anything else.</p>
<p>I am glad to see you in such high spirits about the land, and I hope
you will remain so, if you never get richer. I seldom venture to think
about our landed wealth, for “hope deferred maketh the heart sick.“</p>
<p>I did intend to answer your letter, but I am too lazy and too sleepy
now. We have had a rough time during the last 24 hours working through
the ice between Cairo and Saint Louis, and I have had but little
rest.</p>
<p>I got here too late to see the funeral of the 10 victims by the
burning of the Pacific hotel in 7th street. Ma says there were 10
hearses, with the fire companies (their engines in mourning–firemen in
uniform,) the various benevolent societies in uniform and mourning, and
a multitude of citizens and strangers, forming, altogether, a procession
of 30,000 persons! One steam fire engine was drawn by four white horses,
with crape festoons on their heads. Well I am–just–about–asleep– Your
brother SAM.</p>
<p>Among other things, we gather from this letter that Orion Clemens had
faith in his brother as a newspaper correspondent, though the two
contributions from Cincinnati, already mentioned, were not promising.
Furthermore, we get an intimation of Orion’s unfailing confidence in the
future of the “land“–that is to say, the great tract of land in Eastern
Tennessee which, in an earlier day, his father had bought as a heritage
for his children. It is the same Tennessee land that had “millions in
it“ for Colonel Sellers–the land that would become, as Orion Clemens
long afterward phrased it, “the worry of three generations.“</p>
<p>The Doctor Kane of this letter is, of course, Dr. Elisha Kent Kane,
the American Arctic explorer. Any book of exploration always appealed to
Mark Twain, and in those days Kane was a favorite.</p>
<p>The paragraph concerning Henry, and his employment on the
Pennsylvania, begins the story of a tragedy. The story has been fully
told elsewhere,–[Mark Twain: A Biography, by same author.] –and need
only be sketched briefly here. Henry, a gentle, faithful boy, shared
with his brother the enmity of the pilot Brown. Some two months
following the date of the foregoing letter, on a down trip of the
Pennsylvania, an unprovoked attack made by Brown upon the boy brought
his brother Sam to the rescue. Brown received a good pummeling at the
hands of the future humorist, who, though upheld by the captain, decided
to quit the Pennsylvania at New Orleans and to come up the river by
another boat. The Brown episode has no special bearing on the main
tragedy, though now in retrospect it seems closely related to it. Samuel
Clemens, coming up the river on the A. T. Lacey, two days behind the
Pennsylvania, heard a voice shout as they approached the Greenville,
Mississippi, landing:</p>
<p>“The Pennsylvania is blown up just below Memphis, at Ship Island! One
hundred and fifty lives lost!“</p>
<p>It was a true report. At six o’clock of a warm, mid-June morning,
while loading wood, sixty miles below Memphis, the Pennsylvania’s
boilers had exploded with fearful results. Henry Clemens was among the
injured. He was still alive when his brother reached Memphis on the
Lacey, but died a few days later. Samuel Clemens had idolized the boy,
and regarded himself responsible for his death. The letter that follows
shows that he was overwrought by the scenes about him and the strain of
watching, yet the anguish of it is none the less real.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Onion Clemens:</p>
<p>MEMPHIS, TENN., Friday, June 18th, 1858. DEAR SISTER MOLLIE,–Long
before this reaches you, my poor Henry my darling, my pride, my glory,
my all, will have finished his blameless career, and the light of my
life will have gone out in utter darkness. (O, God! this is hard to
bear.) Hardened, hopeless,–aye, lost–lost –lost and ruined sinner as I
am–I, even I, have humbled myself to the ground and prayed as never man
prayed before, that the great God might let this cup pass from me–that
he would strike me to the earth, but spare my brother–that he would pour
out the fulness of his just wrath upon my wicked head, but have mercy,
mercy, mercy upon that unoffending boy. The horrors of three days have
swept over me–they have blasted my youth and left me an old man before
my time. Mollie, there are gray hairs in my head tonight. For
forty-eight hours I labored at the bedside of my poor burned and
bruised, but uncomplaining brother, and then the star of my hope went
out and left me in the gloom of despair. Men take me by the hand and
congratulate me, and call me “lucky“ because I was not on the
Pennsylvania when she blew up! May God forgive them, for they know not
what they say.</p>
<p>Mollie you do not understand why I was not on that boat–I will tell
you. I left Saint Louis on her, but on the way down, Mr. Brown, the
pilot that was killed by the explosion (poor fellow,) quarreled with
Henry without cause, while I was steering. Henry started out of the
pilot-house–Brown jumped up and collared him–turned him half way around
and struck him in the face!–and him nearly six feet high–struck my
little brother. I was wild from that moment. I left the boat to steer
herself, and avenged the insult–and the Captain said I was right–that he
would discharge Brown in N. Orleans if he could get another pilot, and
would do it in St. Louis, anyhow. Of course both of us could not return
to St. Louis on the same boat–no pilot could be found, and the Captain
sent me to the A. T. Lacey, with orders to her Captain to bring me to
Saint Louis. Had another pilot been found, poor Brown would have been
the “lucky“ man.</p>
<p>I was on the Pennsylvania five minutes before she left N. Orleans,
and I must tell you the truth, Mollie–three hundred human beings
perished by that fearful disaster. Henry was asleep–was blown up–then
fell back on the hot boilers, and I suppose that rubbish fell on him,
for he is injured internally. He got into the water and swam to shore,
and got into the flatboat with the other survivors.–[Henry had returned
once to the Pennsylvania to render assistance to the passengers. Later
he had somehow made his way to the flatboat.]–He had nothing on but his
wet shirt, and he lay there burning up with a southern sun and freezing
in the wind till the Kate Frisbee came along. His wounds were not
dressed till he got to Memphis, 15 hours after the explosion. He was
senseless and motionless for 12 hours after that. But may God bless
Memphis, the noblest city on the face of the earth. She has done her
duty by these poor afflicted creatures–especially Henry, for he has had
five–aye, ten, fifteen, twenty times the care and attention that any one
else has had. Dr. Peyton, the best physician in Memphis (he is exactly
like the portraits of Webster) sat by him for 36 hours. There are 32
scalded men in that room, and you would know Dr. Peyton better than I
can describe him, if you could follow him around and hear each man
murmur as he passes, “May the God of Heaven bless you, Doctor!“ The
ladies have done well, too. Our second Mate, a handsome, noble hearted
young fellow, will die. Yesterday a beautiful girl of 15 stooped timidly
down by his side and handed him a pretty bouquet. The poor suffering
boy’s eyes kindled, his lips quivered out a gentle “God bless you,
Miss,“ and he burst into tears. He made them write her name on a card
for him, that he might not forget it.</p>
<p>Pray for me, Mollie, and pray for my poor sinless brother. Your
unfortunate Brother, SAML. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>P. S. I got here two days after Henry.</p>
<p>It is said that Mark Twain never really recovered from the tragedy of
his brother’s death–that it was responsible for the serious, pathetic
look that the face of the world’s greatest laugh-maker always wore in
repose.</p>
<p>He went back to the river, and in September of the same year, after
an apprenticeship of less than eighteen months, received his license as
a St. Louis and New Orleans pilot, and was accepted by his old chief,
Bixby, as full partner on an important boat. In Life on the Mississippi
Mark Twain makes the period of his study from two to two and a half
years, but this is merely an attempt to magnify his dullness. He was, in
fact, an apt pupil and a pilot of very high class.</p>
<p>Clemens was now suddenly lifted to a position of importance. The
Mississippi River pilot of those days was a person of distinction,
earning a salary then regarded as princely. Certainly two hundred and
fifty dollars a month was large for a boy of twenty-three. At once, of
course, he became the head of the Clemens family. His brother Orion was
ten years older, but he had not the gift of success. By common consent
the younger brother assumed permanently the position of family counselor
and financier. We expect him to feel the importance of his new position,
and he is too human to disappoint us. Incidentally, we notice an
improvement in his English. He no longer writes “between you and I“</p>
<p>Fragment of a letter to Orion Clemens. Written at St. Louis in
1859:</p>
<p>…..I am not talking nonsense, now–I am in earnest, I want you to keep
your troubles and your plans out of the reach of meddlers, until the
latter are consummated, so that in case you fail, no one will know it
but yourself.</p>
<p>Above all things (between you and me) never tell Ma any of your
troubles; she never slept a wink the night your last letter came, and
she looks distressed yet. Write only cheerful news to her. You know that
she will not be satisfied so long as she thinks anything is going on
that she is ignorant of–and she makes a little fuss about it when her
suspicions are awakened; but that makes no difference–. I know that it
is better that she be kept in the dark concerning all things of an
unpleasant nature. She upbraids me occasionally for giving her only the
bright side of my affairs (but unfortunately for her she has to put up
with it, for I know that troubles that I curse awhile and forget, would
disturb her slumbers for some time.) (Parenthesis No. 2–Possibly because
she is deprived of the soothing consolation of swearing.) Tell her the
good news and me the bad.</p>
<p>Putting all things together, I begin to think I am rather lucky than
otherwise–a notion which I was slow to take up. The other night I was
about to round to for a storm–but concluded that I could find a smoother
bank somewhere. I landed 5 miles below. The storm came–passed away and
did not injure us. Coming up, day before yesterday, I looked at the spot
I first chose, and half the trees on the bank were torn to shreds. We
couldn’t have lived 5 minutes in such a tornado. And I am also lucky in
having a berth, while all the young pilots are idle. This is the
luckiest circumstance that ever befell me. Not on account of the wages
–for that is a secondary consideration–but from the fact that the City
of Memphis is the largest boat in the trade and the hardest to pilot,
and consequently I can get a reputation on her, which is a thing I never
could accomplish on a transient boat. I can “bank“ in the neighborhood
of 00 a month on her, and that will satisfy me for the present
(principally because the other youngsters are sucking their fingers.)
Bless me! what a pleasure there is in revenge! and what vast respect
Prosperity commands! Why, six months ago, I could enter the “Rooms,“ and
receive only a customary fraternal greeting–but now they say, “Why, how
are you, old fellow–when did you get in?“</p>
<p>And the young pilots who used to tell me, patronizingly, that I could
never learn the river cannot keep from showing a little of their chagrin
at seeing me so far ahead of them. Permit me to “blow my horn,“ for I
derive a living pleasure from these things, and I must confess that when
I go to pay my dues, I rather like to let the d—d rascals get a glimpse
of a hundred dollar bill peeping out from amongst notes of smaller
dimensions, whose face I do not exhibit! You will despise this egotism,
but I tell you there is a “stern joy“ in it…..</p>
<p>Pilots did not remain long on one boat, as a rule; just why it is not
so easy to understand. Perhaps they liked the experience of change;
perhaps both captain and pilot liked the pursuit of the ideal. In the
light-hearted letter that follows–written to a friend of the family,
formerly of Hannibal–we get something of the uncertainty of the pilot’s
engagements.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Elizabeth W. Smith, in Jackson, Cape Girardeau County,
Mo.:</p>
<p>ST. Louis, Oct. 31 [probably 1859]. DEAR AUNT BETSEY,–Ma has not
written you, because she did not know when I would get started down the
river again…..</p>
<p>You see, Aunt Betsey, I made but one trip on the packet after you
left, and then concluded to remain at home awhile. I have just
discovered this morning that I am to go to New Orleans on the “Col.
Chambers“–fine, light-draught, swift-running passenger steamer–all
modern accommodations and improvements–through with dispatch–for freight
or passage apply on board, or to–but–I have forgotten the agent’s
name–however, it makes no difference–and as I was saying, or had
intended to say, Aunt Betsey, probably, if you are ready to come up, you
had better take the “Ben Lewis,“ the best boat in the packet line. She
will be at Cape Girardeau at noon on Saturday (day after tomorrow,) and
will reach here at breakfast time, Sunday. If Mr. Hamilton is chief
clerk,–very well, I am slightly acquainted with him. And if Messrs.
Carter Gray and Dean Somebody (I have forgotten his other name,) are in
the pilot-house–very well again-I am acquainted with them. Just tell
Mr. Gray, Aunt Betsey –that I wish him to place himself at your
command.</p>
<p>All the family are well–except myself–I am in a bad way
again–disease, Love, in its most malignant form. Hopes are entertained
of my recovery, however. At the dinner table–excellent symptom–I am
still as “terrible as an army with banners.“</p>
<p>Aunt Betsey–the wickedness of this world–but I haven’t time to
moralize this morning. Goodbye SAM CLEMENS.</p>
<p>As we do not hear of this “attack“ again, the recovery was probably
prompt. His letters are not frequent enough for us to keep track of his
boats, but we know that he was associated with Bixby from time to time,
and now and again with one of the Bowen boys, his old Hannibal
schoolmates. He was reveling in the river life, the ease and distinction
and romance of it. No other life would ever suit him as well. He was at
the age to enjoy just what it brought him –at the airy, golden,
overweening age of youth.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in Keokuk, Iowa:</p>
<p>ST. LOUIS, Mch. 1860. MY DEAR BRO.,–Your last has just come to hand.
It reminds me strongly of Tom Hood’s letters to his family, (which I
have been reading lately). But yours only remind me of his, for although
there is a striking likeness, your humour is much finer than his, and
far better expressed. Tom Hood’s wit, (in his letters) has a savor of
labor about it which is very disagreeable. Your letter is good. That
portion of it wherein the old sow figures is the very best thing I have
seen lately. Its quiet style resembles Goldsmith’s “Citizen of the
World,“ and “Don Quixote,“ –which are my beau ideals of fine
writing.</p>
<p>You have paid the preacher! Well, that is good, also. What a man
wants with religion in these breadless times, surpasses my
comprehension.</p>
<p>Pamela and I have just returned from a visit to the most wonderfully
beautiful painting which this city has ever seen–Church’s “Heart of the
Andes“–which represents a lovely valley with its rich vegetation in all
the bloom and glory of a tropical summer–dotted with birds and flowers
of all colors and shades of color, and sunny slopes, and shady corners,
and twilight groves, and cool cascades–all grandly set off with a
majestic mountain in the background with its gleaming summit clothed in
everlasting ice and snow! I have seen it several times, but it is always
a new picture–totally new–you seem to see nothing the second time which
you saw the first. We took the opera glass, and examined its beauties
minutely, for the naked eye cannot discern the little wayside flowers,
and soft shadows and patches of sunshine, and half-hidden bunches of
grass and jets of water which form some of its most enchanting features.
There is no slurring of perspective effect about it–the most distant
–the minutest object in it has a marked and distinct personality–so that
you may count the very leaves on the trees. When you first see the tame,
ordinary-looking picture, your first impulse is to turn your back upon
it, and say “Humbug“–but your third visit will find your brain gasping
and straining with futile efforts to take all the wonder in–and
appreciate it in its fulness–and understand how such a miracle could
have been conceived and executed by human brain and human hands. You
will never get tired of looking at the picture, but your reflections
–your efforts to grasp an intelligible Something–you hardly know what
–will grow so painful that you will have to go away from the thing, in
order to obtain relief. You may find relief, but you cannot banish the
picture–It remains with you still. It is in my mind now–and the smallest
feature could not be removed without my detecting it. So much for the
“Heart of the Andes.“</p>
<p>Ma was delighted with her trip, but she was disgusted with the girls
for allowing me to embrace and kiss them–and she was horrified at the
Schottische as performed by Miss Castle and myself. She was perfectly
willing for me to dance until 12 o’clock at the imminent peril of my
going to sleep on the after watch–but then she would top off with a very
inconsistent sermon on dancing in general; ending with a terrific
broadside aimed at that heresy of heresies, the Schottische.</p>
<p>I took Ma and the girls in a carriage, round that portion of New
Orleans where the finest gardens and residences are to be seen, and
although it was a blazing hot dusty day, they seemed hugely delighted.
To use an expression which is commonly ignored in polite society, they
were “hell-bent“ on stealing some of the luscious-looking oranges from
branches which overhung the fences, but I restrained them. They were not
aware before that shrubbery could be made to take any queer shape which
a skilful gardener might choose to twist it into, so they found not only
beauty but novelty in their visit. We went out to Lake Pontchartrain in
the cars. Your Brother SAM CLEMENS</p>
<p>We have not before heard of Miss Castle, who appears to have been one
of the girls who accompanied Jane Clemens on the trip which her son gave
her to New Orleans, but we may guess that the other was his cousin and
good comrade, Ella Creel. One wishes that he might have left us a more
extended account of that long-ago river journey, a fuller glimpse of a
golden age that has vanished as completely as the days of
Washington.</p>
<p>We may smile at the natural youthful desire to air his reading, and
his art appreciation, and we may find his opinions not without interest.
We may even commend them–in part. Perhaps we no longer count the leaves
on Church’s trees, but Goldsmith and Cervantes still deserve the place
assigned them.</p>
<p>He does not tell us what boat he was on at this time, but later in
the year he was with Bixby again, on the Alonzo Child. We get a bit of
the pilot in port in his next.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in Keokuk, Iowa:</p>
<p>“ALONZO CHILD,“ N. ORLEANS, Sep. 28th 1860. DEAR BROTHER,–I just
received yours and Mollies letter yesterday–they had been here two
weeks–forwarded from St. Louis. We got here yesterday–will leave at noon
to-day. Of course I have had no time, in 24 hours, to do anything.
Therefore I’ll answer after we are under way again. Yesterday, I had
many things to do, but Bixby and I got with the pilots of two other
boats and went off dissipating on a ten dollar dinner at a French
restaurant breathe it not unto Ma!–where we ate sheep-head, fish with
mushrooms, shrimps and oysters–birds–coffee with brandy burnt in it,
andandandandc andandandandc,–ate, drank and smoked, from 2 p.m. until 5
o’clock, and then–then the day was too far gone to do any thing.</p>
<p>Please find enclosed and acknowledge receipt of–0.00 In haste SAM L.
CLEMENS</p>
<p>It should be said, perhaps, that when he became pilot Jane Clemens
had released her son from his pledge in the matter of cards and liquor.
This license did not upset him, however. He cared very little for either
of these dissipations. His one great indulgence was tobacco, a matter
upon which he was presently to receive some grave counsel. He reports it
in his next letter, a sufficiently interesting document. The clairvoyant
of this visit was Madame Caprell, famous in her day. Clemens had been
urged to consult her, and one idle afternoon concluded to make the
experiment. The letter reporting the matter to his brother is
fragmentary, and is the last remaining to us of the piloting period.</p>
<p>Fragment of a letter to Orion Clemens, in Keokuk, Iowa:</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS February 6, 1862. …..She’s a very pleasant little
lady–rather pretty–about 28,–say 5 feet 2 and one quarter–would weigh
116–has black eyes and hair–is polite and intelligent–used good
language, and talks much faster than I do.</p>
<p>She invited me into the little back parlor, closed the door; and we
were alone. We sat down facing each other. Then she asked my age. Then
she put her hands before her eyes a moment, and commenced talking as if
she had a good deal to say and not much time to say it in. Something
after this style:</p>
<p>MADAME. Yours is a watery planet; you gain your livelihood on the
water; but you should have been a lawyer–there is where your talents
lie: you might have distinguished yourself as an orator, or as an
editor; you have written a great deal; you write well–but you are rather
out of practice; no matter–you will be in practice some day; you have a
superb constitution, and as excellent health as any man in the world;
you have great powers of endurance; in your profession your strength
holds out against the longest sieges, without flagging; still, the upper
part of your lungs, the top of them is slightly affected–you must take
care of yourself; you do not drink, but you use entirely too much
tobacco; and you must stop it; mind, not moderate, but stop the use of
it totally; then I can almost promise you 86 when you will surely die;
otherwise look out for 28, 31, 34, 47, and 65; be careful–for you are
not of a long-lived race, that is on your father’s side; you are the
only healthy member of your family, and the only one in it who has
anything like the certainty of attaining to a great age–so, stop using
tobacco, and be careful of yourself….. In some respects you take after
your father, but you are much more like your mother, who belongs to the
long-lived, energetic side of the house…. You never brought all your
energies to bear upon any subject but what you accomplished it–for
instance, you are self-made, self-educated.</p>
<p>S. L. C. Which proves nothing.</p>
<p>MADAME. Don’t interrupt. When you sought your present occupation you
found a thousand obstacles in the way–obstacles unknown–not even
suspected by any save you and me, since you keep such matters to
yourself–but you fought your way, and hid the long struggle under a mask
of cheerfulness, which saved your friends anxiety on your account. To do
all this requires all the qualities I have named.</p>
<p>S. L. C. You flatter well, Madame.</p>
<p>MADAME. Don’t interrupt: Up to within a short time you had always
lived from hand to mouth-now you are in easy circumstances–for which you
need give credit to no one but yourself. The turning point in your life
occurred in 1840-7-8.</p>
<p>S. L. C. Which was?</p>
<p>MADAME. A death perhaps, and this threw you upon the world and made
you what you are; it was always intended that you should make yourself;
therefore, it was well that this calamity occurred as early as it did.
You will never die of water, although your career upon it in the future
seems well sprinkled with misfortune. You will continue upon the water
for some time yet; you will not retire finally until ten years from now
…. What is your brother’s age? 35–and a lawyer? and in pursuit of an
office? Well, he stands a better chance than the other two, and he may
get it; he is too visionary–is always flying off on a new hobby; this
will never do–tell him I said so. He is a good lawyer–a, very good
lawyer–and a fine speaker–is very popular and much respected, and makes
many friends; but although he retains their friendship, he loses their
confidence by displaying his instability of character….. The land he has
now will be very valuable after a while–</p>
<p>S. L. C. Say a 50 years hence, or thereabouts. Madame–</p>
<p>MADAME. No–less time-but never mind the land, that is a secondary
consideration–let him drop that for the present, and devote himself to
his business and politics with all his might, for he must hold offices
under the Government…..</p>
<p>After a while you will possess a good deal of property–retire at the
end of ten years–after which your pursuits will be literary–try the law
–you will certainly succeed. I am done now. If you have any questions to
ask–ask them freely–and if it be in my power, I will answer without
reserve–without reserve.</p>
<p>I asked a few questions of minor importance–paid her –and left, under
the decided impression that going to the fortune teller’s was just as
good as going to the opera, and the cost scarcely a trifle more–ergo, I
will disguise myself and go again, one of these days, when other
amusements fail. Now isn’t she the devil? That is to say, isn’t she a
right smart little woman?</p>
<p>When you want money, let Ma know, and she will send it. She and
Pamela are always fussing about change, so I sent them a hundred and
twenty quarters yesterday–fiddler’s change enough to last till I get
back, I reckon. SAM.</p>
<p>It is not so difficult to credit Madame Caprell with clairvoyant
powers when one has read the letters of Samuel Clemens up to this point.
If we may judge by those that have survived, her prophecy of literary
distinction for him was hardly warranted by anything she could have
known of his past performance. These letters of his youth have a value
to-day only because they were written by the man who later was to become
Mark Twain. The squibs and skits which he sometimes contributed to the
New Orleans papers were bright, perhaps, and pleasing to his pilot
associates, but they were without literary value. He was twenty-five
years old. More than one author has achieved reputation at that age.
Mark Twain was of slower growth; at that age he had not even developed a
definite literary ambition: Whatever the basis of Madame Caprell’s
prophecy, we must admit that she was a good guesser on several matters,
“a right smart little woman,“ as Clemens himself phrased it.</p>
<p>She overlooked one item, however: the proximity of the Civil War.
Perhaps it was too close at hand for second sight. A little more than
two months after the Caprell letter was written Fort Sumter was fired
upon. Mask Twain had made his last trip as a pilot up the river to
St. Louis–the nation was plunged into a four years’ conflict.</p>
<p>There are no letters of this immediate period. Young Clemens went to
Hannibal, and enlisting in a private company, composed mainly of old
schoolmates, went soldiering for two rainy, inglorious weeks, by the end
of which he had had enough of war, and furthermore had discovered that
he was more of a Union abolitionist than a slave-holding secessionist,
as he had at first supposed. Convictions were likely to be rather infirm
during those early days of the war, and subject to change without
notice. Especially was this so in a border State.</p>
