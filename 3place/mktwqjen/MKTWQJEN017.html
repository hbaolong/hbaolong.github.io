<h4 id="chapter-xvi.">CHAPTER XVI.</h4>
<p>VERSAILLES! It is wonderfully beautiful! You gaze and stare and try
to understand that it is real, that it is on the earth, that it is not
the Garden of Eden–but your brain grows giddy, stupefied by the world of
beauty around you, and you half believe you are the dupe of an exquisite
dream. The scene thrills one like military music! A noble palace,
stretching its ornamented front, block upon block away, till it seemed
that it would never end; a grand promenade before it, whereon the armies
of an empire might parade; all about it rainbows of flowers, and
colossal statues that were almost numberless and yet seemed only
scattered over the ample space; broad flights of stone steps leading
down from the promenade to lower grounds of the park–stairways that
whole regiments might stand to arms upon and have room to spare; vast
fountains whose great bronze effigies discharged rivers of sparkling
water into the air and mingled a hundred curving jets together in forms
of matchless beauty; wide grass-carpeted avenues that branched hither
and thither in every direction and wandered to seemingly interminable
distances, walled all the way on either side with compact ranks of leafy
trees whose branches met above and formed arches as faultless and as
symmetrical as ever were carved in stone; and here and there were
glimpses of sylvan lakes with miniature ships glassed in their surfaces.
And every where–on the palace steps, and the great promenade, around the
fountains, among the trees, and far under the arches of the endless
avenues–hundreds and hundreds of people in gay costumes walked or ran or
danced, and gave to the fairy picture the life and animation which was
all of perfection it could have lacked.</p>
<p>It was worth a pilgrimage to see. Everything is on so gigantic a
scale. Nothing is small–nothing is cheap. The statues are all large; the
palace is grand; the park covers a fair-sized county; the avenues are
interminable. All the distances and all the dimensions about Versailles
are vast. I used to think the pictures exaggerated these distances and
these dimensions beyond all reason, and that they made Versailles more
beautiful than it was possible for any place in the world to be. I know
now that the pictures never came up to the subject in any respect, and
that no painter could represent Versailles on canvas as beautiful as it
is in reality. I used to abuse Louis XIV for spending two hundred
millions of dollars in creating this marvelous park, when bread was so
scarce with some of his subjects; but I have forgiven him now. He took a
tract of land sixty miles in circumference and set to work to make this
park and build this palace and a road to it from Paris. He kept 36,000
men employed daily on it, and the labor was so unhealthy that they used
to die and be hauled off by cartloads every night. The wife of a
nobleman of the time speaks of this as an “inconvenience,“ but naively
remarks that “it does not seem worthy of attention in the happy state of
tranquillity we now enjoy.“</p>
<p>I always thought ill of people at home who trimmed their shrubbery
into pyramids and squares and spires and all manner of unnatural shapes,
and when I saw the same thing being practiced in this great park I began
to feel dissatisfied. But I soon saw the idea of the thing and the
wisdom of it. They seek the general effect. We distort a dozen sickly
trees into unaccustomed shapes in a little yard no bigger than a dining
room, and then surely they look absurd enough. But here they take two
hundred thousand tall forest trees and set them in a double row; allow
no sign of leaf or branch to grow on the trunk lower down than six feet
above the ground; from that point the boughs begin to project, and very
gradually they extend outward further and further till they meet
overhead, and a faultless tunnel of foliage is formed. The arch is
mathematically precise. The effect is then very fine. They make trees
take fifty different shapes, and so these quaint effects are infinitely
varied and picturesque. The trees in no two avenues are shaped alike,
and consequently the eye is not fatigued with anything in the nature of
monotonous uniformity. I will drop this subject now, leaving it to
others to determine how these people manage to make endless ranks of
lofty forest trees grow to just a certain thickness of trunk (say a foot
and two-thirds); how they make them spring to precisely the same height
for miles; how they make them grow so close together; how they compel
one huge limb to spring from the same identical spot on each tree and
form the main sweep of the arch; and how all these things are kept
exactly in the same condition and in the same exquisite shapeliness and
symmetry month after month and year after year–for I have tried to
reason out the problem and have failed.</p>
<p>We walked through the great hall of sculpture and the one hundred and
fifty galleries of paintings in the palace of Versailles, and felt that
to be in such a place was useless unless one had a whole year at his
disposal. These pictures are all battle scenes, and only one solitary
little canvas among them all treats of anything but great French
victories. We wandered, also, through the Grand Trianon and the Petit
Trianon, those monuments of royal prodigality, and with histories so
mournful–filled, as it is, with souvenirs of Napoleon the First, and
three dead kings and as many queens. In one sumptuous bed they had all
slept in succession, but no one occupies it now. In a large dining room
stood the table at which Louis XIV and his mistress Madame Maintenon,
and after them Louis XV, and Pompadour, had sat at their meals naked and
unattended–for the table stood upon a trapdoor, which descended with it
to regions below when it was necessary to replenish its dishes. In a
room of the Petit Trianon stood the furniture, just as poor Marie
Antoinette left it when the mob came and dragged her and the King to
Paris, never to return. Near at hand, in the stables, were prodigious
carriages that showed no color but gold–carriages used by former kings
of France on state occasions, and never used now save when a kingly head
is to be crowned or an imperial infant christened. And with them were
some curious sleighs, whose bodies were shaped like lions, swans,
tigers, etc.–vehicles that had once been handsome with pictured designs
and fine workmanship, but were dusty and decaying now. They had their
history. When Louis XIV had finished the Grand Trianon, he told
Maintenon he had created a Paradise for her, and asked if she could
think of anything now to wish for. He said he wished the Trianon to be
perfection–nothing less. She said she could think of but one thing–it
was summer, and it was balmy France–yet she would like well to sleigh
ride in the leafy avenues of Versailles! The next morning found miles
and miles of grassy avenues spread thick with snowy salt and sugar, and
a procession of those quaint sleighs waiting to receive the chief
concubine of the gaiest and most unprincipled court that France has ever
seen!</p>
<p>From sumptuous Versailles, with its palaces, its statues, its
gardens, and its fountains, we journeyed back to Paris and sought its
antipodes –the Faubourg St. Antoine. Little, narrow streets; dirty
children blockading them; greasy, slovenly women capturing and spanking
them; filthy dens on first floors, with rag stores in them (the heaviest
business in the Faubourg is the chiffonier’s); other filthy dens where
whole suits of second and third-hand clothing are sold at prices that
would ruin any proprietor who did not steal his stock; still other
filthy dens where they sold groceries–sold them by the
half-pennyworth–five dollars would buy the man out, goodwill and all. Up
these little crooked streets they will murder a man for seven dollars
and dump the body in the Seine. And up some other of these streets–most
of them, I should say –live lorettes.</p>
<p>All through this Faubourg St. Antoine, misery, poverty, vice, and
crime go hand in hand, and the evidences of it stare one in the face
from every side. Here the people live who begin the revolutions.
Whenever there is anything of that kind to be done, they are always
ready. They take as much genuine pleasure in building a barricade as
they do in cutting a throat or shoving a friend into the Seine. It is
these savage-looking ruffians who storm the splendid halls of the
Tuileries occasionally, and swarm into Versailles when a king is to be
called to account.</p>
<p>But they will build no more barricades, they will break no more
soldiers’ heads with paving-stones. Louis Napoleon has taken care of all
that. He is annihilating the crooked streets and building in their stead
noble boulevards as straight as an arrow–avenues which a cannon ball
could traverse from end to end without meeting an obstruction more
irresistible than the flesh and bones of men–boulevards whose stately
edifices will never afford refuges and plotting places for starving,
discontented revolution breeders. Five of these great thoroughfares
radiate from one ample centre–a centre which is exceedingly well adapted
to the accommodation of heavy artillery. The mobs used to riot there,
but they must seek another rallying-place in future. And this ingenious
Napoleon paves the streets of his great cities with a smooth, compact
composition of asphaltum and sand. No more barricades of flagstones–no
more assaulting his Majesty’s troops with cobbles. I cannot feel
friendly toward my quondam fellow-American, Napoleon III., especially at
this time,–[July, 1867.]–when in fancy I see his credulous victim,
Maximilian, lying stark and stiff in Mexico, and his maniac widow
watching eagerly from her French asylum for the form that will never
come–but I do admire his nerve, his calm self-reliance, his shrewd good
sense.</p>
