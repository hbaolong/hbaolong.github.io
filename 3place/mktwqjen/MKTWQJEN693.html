<h4 id="chapter-viii.">CHAPTER VIII.</h4>
<p>It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no
distinctly native American criminal class except Congress. –Pudd’nhead
Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>When one glances at the map the members of the stupendous island
wilderness of the Pacific seem to crowd upon each other; but no, there
is no crowding, even in the center of a group; and between groups there
are lonely wide deserts of sea. Not everything is known about the
islands, their peoples and their languages. A startling reminder of this
is furnished by the fact that in Fiji, twenty years ago, were living two
strange and solitary beings who came from an unknown country and spoke
an unknown language. “They were picked up by a passing vessel many
hundreds of miles from any known land, floating in the same tiny canoe
in which they had been blown out to sea. When found they were but skin
and bone. No one could understand what they said, and they have never
named their country; or, if they have, the name does not correspond with
that of any island on any chart. They are now fat and sleek, and as
happy as the day is long. In the ship’s log there is an entry of the
latitude and longitude in which they were found, and this is probably
all the clue they will ever have to their lost homes.“–[Forbes’s “Two
Years in Fiji.“]</p>
<p>What a strange and romantic episode it is; and how one is tortured
with curiosity to know whence those mysterious creatures came, those Men
Without a Country, errant waifs who cannot name their lost home,
wandering Children of Nowhere.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Island Wilderness is the very home of romance and dreams
and mystery. The loneliness, the solemnity, the beauty, and the deep
repose of this wilderness have a charm which is all their own for the
bruised spirit of men who have fought and failed in the struggle for
life in the great world; and for men who have been hunted out of the
great world for crime; and for other men who love an easy and indolent
existence; and for others who love a roving free life, and stir and
change and adventure; and for yet others who love an easy and
comfortable career of trading and money-getting, mixed with plenty of
loose matrimony by purchase, divorce without trial or expense, and
limitless spreeing thrown in to make life ideally perfect.</p>
<p>We sailed again, refreshed.</p>
<p>The most cultivated person in the ship was a young English, man whose
home was in New Zealand. He was a naturalist. His learning in his
specialty was deep and thorough, his interest in his subject amounted to
a passion, he had an easy gift of speech; and so, when he talked about
animals it was a pleasure to listen to him. And profitable, too, though
he was sometimes difficult to understand because now and then he used
scientific technicalities which were above the reach of some of us. They
were pretty sure to be above my reach, but as he was quite willing to
explain them I always made it a point to get him to do it. I had a fair
knowledge of his subject–layman’s knowledge–to begin with, but it was
his teachings which crystalized it into scientific form and clarity–in a
word, gave it value.</p>
<p>His special interest was the fauna of Australasia, and his knowledge
of the matter was as exhaustive as it was accurate. I already knew a
good deal about the rabbits in Australasia and their marvelous
fecundity, but in my talks with him I found that my estimate of the
great hindrance and obstruction inflicted by the rabbit pest upon
traffic and travel was far short of the facts. He told me that the first
pair of rabbits imported into Australasia bred so wonderfully that
within six months rabbits were so thick in the land that people had to
dig trenches through them to get from town to town.</p>
<p>He told me a great deal about worms, and the kangaroo, and other
coleoptera, and said he knew the history and ways of all such
pachydermata. He said the kangaroo had pockets, and carried its young in
them when it couldn’t get apples. And he said that the emu was as big as
an ostrich, and looked like one, and had an amorphous appetite and would
eat bricks. Also, that the dingo was not a dingo at all, but just a wild
dog; and that the only difference between a dingo and a dodo was that
neither of them barked; otherwise they were just the same. He said that
the only game-bird in Australia was the wombat, and the only song-bird
the larrikin, and that both were protected by government. The most
beautiful of the native birds was the bird of Paradise. Next came the
two kinds of lyres; not spelt the same. He said the one kind was dying
out, the other thickening up. He explained that the “Sundowner“ was not
a bird it was a man; sundowner was merely the Australian equivalent of
our word, tramp. He is a loafer, a hard drinker, and a sponge. He tramps
across the country in the sheep-shearing season, pretending to look for
work; but he always times himself to arrive at a sheep-run just at
sundown, when the day’s labor ends; all he wants is whisky and supper
and bed and breakfast; he gets them and then disappears. The naturalist
spoke of the bell bird, the creature that at short intervals all day
rings out its mellow and exquisite peal from the deeps of the forest. It
is the favorite and best friend of the weary and thirsty sundowner; for
he knows that wherever the bell bird is, there is water; and he goes
somewhere else. The naturalist said that the oddest bird in Australasia
was the, Laughing Jackass, and the biggest the now extinct Great
Moa.</p>
<p>The Moa stood thirteen feet high, and could step over an ordinary
man’s head or kick his hat off; and his head, too, for that matter. He
said it was wingless, but a swift runner. The natives used to ride it.
It could make forty miles an hour, and keep it up for four hundred miles
and come out reasonably fresh. It was still in existence when the
railway was introduced into New Zealand; still in existence, and
carrying the mails. The railroad began with the same schedule it has
now: two expresses a week-time, twenty miles an hour. The company
exterminated the moa to get the mails.</p>
<p>Speaking of the indigenous coneys and bactrian camels, the naturalist
said that the coniferous and bacteriological output of Australasia was
remarkable for its many and curious departures from the accepted laws
governing these species of tubercles, but that in his opinion Nature’s
fondness for dabbling in the erratic was most notably exhibited in that
curious combination of bird, fish, amphibian, burrower, crawler,
quadruped, and Christian called the Ornithorhynchus–grotesquest of
animals, king of the animalculae of the world for versatility of
character and make-up. Said he:</p>
<p>“You can call it anything you want to, and be right. It is a fish,
for it lives in the river half the time; it is a land animal, for it
resides on the land half the time; it is an amphibian, since it likes
both and does not know which it prefers; it is a hybernian, for when
times are dull and nothing much going on it buries itself under the mud
at the bottom of a puddle and hybernates there a couple of weeks at a
time; it is a kind of duck, for it has a duck-bill and four webbed
paddles; it is a fish and quadruped together, for in the water it swims
with the paddles and on shore it paws itself across country with them;
it is a kind of seal, for it has a seal’s fur; it is carnivorous,
herbivorous, insectivorous, and vermifuginous, for it eats fish and
grass and butterflies, and in the season digs worms out of the mud and
devours them; it is clearly a bird, for it lays eggs, and hatches them;
it is clearly a mammal, for it nurses its young; and it is manifestly a
kind of Christian, for it keeps the Sabbath when there is anybody
around, and when there isn’t, doesn’t. It has all the tastes there are
except refined ones, it has all the habits there are except good
ones.</p>
<p>“It is a survival–a survival of the fittest. Mr. Darwin invented the
theory that goes by that name, but the Ornithorhynchus was the first to
put it to actual experiment and prove that it could be done. Hence it
should have as much of the credit as Mr. Darwin. It was never in the
Ark; you will find no mention of it there; it nobly stayed out and
worked the theory. Of all creatures in the world it was the only one
properly equipped for the test. The Ark was thirteen months afloat, and
all the globe submerged; no land visible above the flood, no vegetation,
no food for a mammal to eat, nor water for a mammal to drink; for all
mammal food was destroyed, and when the pure floods from heaven and the
salt oceans of the earth mingled their waters and rose above the
mountain tops, the result was a drink which no bird or beast of ordinary
construction could use and live. But this combination was nuts for the
Ornithorhynchus, if I may use a term like that without offense. Its
river home had always been salted by the flood-tides of the sea. On the
face of the Noachian deluge innumerable forest trees were floating. Upon
these the Ornithorhynchus voyaged in peace; voyaged from clime to clime,
from hemisphere to hemisphere, in contentment and comfort, in virile
interest in the constant change Of scene, in humble thankfulness for its
privileges, in ever-increasing enthusiasm in the development of the
great theory upon whose validity it had staked its life, its fortunes,
and its sacred honor, if I may use such expressions without impropriety
in connection with an episode of this nature.</p>
<p>“It lived the tranquil and luxurious life of a creature of
independent means. Of things actually necessary to its existence and its
happiness not a detail was wanting. When it wished to walk, it scrambled
along the tree-trunk; it mused in the shade of the leaves by day, it
slept in their shelter by night; when it wanted the refreshment of a
swim, it had it; it ate leaves when it wanted a vegetable diet, it dug
under the bark for worms and grubs; when it wanted fish it caught them,
when it wanted eggs it laid them. If the grubs gave out in one tree it
swam to another; and as for fish, the very opulence of the supply was an
embarrassment. And finally, when it was thirsty it smacked its chops in
gratitude over a blend that would have slain a crocodile.</p>
<p>“When at last, after thirteen months of travel and research in all
the Zones it went aground on a mountain-summit, it strode ashore, saying
in its heart, ’Let them that come after me invent theories and dream
dreams about the Survival of the Fittest if they like, but I am the
first that has done it!</p>
<p>“This wonderful creature dates back like the kangaroo and many other
Australian hydrocephalous invertebrates, to an age long anterior to the
advent of man upon the earth; they date back, indeed, to a time when a
causeway hundreds of miles wide, and thousands of miles long, joined
Australia to Africa, and the animals of the two countries were alike,
and all belonged to that remote geological epoch known to science as the
Old Red Grindstone Post-Pleosaurian. Later the causeway sank under the
sea; subterranean convulsions lifted the African continent a thousand
feet higher than it was before, but Australia kept her old level. In
Africa’s new climate the animals necessarily began to develop and shade
off into new forms and families and species, but the animals of
Australia as necessarily remained stationary, and have so remained until
this day. In the course of some millions of years the African
Ornithorhynchus developed and developed and developed, and sluffed off
detail after detail of its make-up until at last the creature became
wholly disintegrated and scattered. Whenever you see a bird or a beast
or a seal or an otter in Africa you know that he is merely a sorry
surviving fragment of that sublime original of whom I have been
speaking–that creature which was everything in general and nothing in
particular–the opulently endowed ‘e pluribus unum’ of the animal
world.</p>
<p>“Such is the history of the most hoary, the most ancient, the most
venerable creature that exists in the earth today–Ornithorhynchus
Platypus Extraordinariensis–whom God preserve!“</p>
<p>When he was strongly moved he could rise and soar like that with
ease. And not only in the prose form, but in the poetical as well. He
had written many pieces of poetry in his time, and these manuscripts he
lent around among the passengers, and was willing to let them be copied.
It seemed to me that the least technical one in the series, and the one
which reached the loftiest note, perhaps, was his:</p>
<p>INVOCATION.</p>
<p>“Come forth from thy oozy couch, O Ornithorhynchus dear! And greet
with a cordial claw The stranger that longs to hear</p>
<p>“From thy own own lips the tale Of thy origin all unknown: Thy
misplaced bone where flesh should be And flesh where should be bone;</p>
<p>“And fishy fin where should be paw, And beaver-trowel tail, And snout
of beast equip’d with teeth Where gills ought to prevail.</p>
<p>“Come, Kangaroo, the good and true Foreshortened as to legs, And body
tapered like a churn, And sack marsupial, i’ fegs,</p>
<p>“And tells us why you linger here, Thou relic of a vanished time,
When all your friends as fossils sleep, Immortalized in lime!“</p>
<p>Perhaps no poet is a conscious plagiarist; but there seems to be
warrant for suspecting that there is no poet who is not at one time or
another an unconscious one. The above verses are indeed beautiful, and,
in a way, touching; but there is a haunting something about them which
unavoidably suggests the Sweet Singer of Michigan. It can hardly be
doubted that the author had read the works of that poet and been
impressed by them. It is not apparent that he has borrowed from them any
word or yet any phrase, but the style and swing and mastery and melody
of the Sweet Singer all are there. Compare this Invocation with “Frank
Dutton“–particularly stanzas first and seventeenth–and I think the
reader will feel convinced that he who wrote the one had read the
other:</p>
<ol type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>“Frank Dutton was as fine a lad As ever you wish to see, And he was
drowned in Pine Island Lake On earth no more will he be, His age was
near fifteen years, And he was a motherless boy, He was living with his
grandmother When he was drowned, poor boy.“</p>
<ol start="17" type="I">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>“He was drowned on Tuesday afternoon, On Sunday he was found, And the
tidings of that drowned boy Was heard for miles around. His form was
laid by his mother’s side, Beneath the cold, cold ground, His friends
for him will drop a tear When they view his little mound.“</p>
