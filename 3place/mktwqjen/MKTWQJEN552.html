<h4 id="extracts-from-adams-diary">EXTRACTS FROM ADAM’S DIARY</h4>
<p>Translated from the original MS.</p>
<p>by Mark Twain</p>
<p>[NOTE.–I translated a portion of this diary some years ago, and a
friend of mine printed a few copies in an incomplete form, but the
public never got them. Since then I have deciphered some more of Adam’s
hieroglyphics, and think he has now become sufficiently important as a
public character to justify this publication.–M. T.]</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>This new creature with the long hair is a good deal in the way. It is
always hanging around and following me about. I don’t like this; I am
not used to company. I wish it would stay with the other animals. Cloudy
to-day, wind in the east; think we shall have rain…. Where did I get
that word?… I remember now –the new creature uses it.</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>Been examining the great waterfall. It is the finest thing on the
estate, I think. The new creature calls it Niagara Falls–why, I am sure
I do not know. Says it looks like Niagara Falls. That is not a reason;
it is mere waywardness and imbecility. I get no chance to name anything
myself. The new creature names everything that comes along, before I can
get in a protest. And always that same pretext is offered–it looks like
the thing. There is the dodo, for instance. Says the moment one looks at
it one sees at a glance that it “looks like a dodo.“ It will have to
keep that name, no doubt. It wearies me to fret about it, and it does no
good, anyway. Dodo! It looks no more like a dodo than I do.</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>Built me a shelter against the rain, but could not have it to myself
in peace. The new creature intruded. When I tried to put it out it shed
water out of the holes it looks with, and wiped it away with the back of
its paws, and made a noise such as some of the other animals make when
they are in distress. I wish it would not talk; it is always talking.
That sounds like a cheap fling at the poor creature, a slur; but I do
not mean it so. I have never heard the human voice before, and any new
and strange sound intruding itself here upon the solemn hush of these
dreaming solitudes offends my ear and seems a false note. And this new
sound is so close to me; it is right at my shoulder, right at my ear,
first on one side and then on the other, and I am used only to sounds
that are more or less distant from me.</p>
<p>Friday</p>
<p>The naming goes recklessly on, in spite of anything I can do. I had a
very good name for the estate, and it was musical and pretty
–GARDEN-OF-EDEN. Privately, I continue to call it that, but not any
longer publicly. The new creature says it is all woods and rocks and
scenery, and therefore has no resemblance to a garden. Says it looks
like a park, and does not look like anything but a park. Consequently,
without consulting me, it has been new-named –NIAGARA FALLS PARK. This
is sufficiently high-handed, it seems to me. And already there is a sign
up:</p>
<p>KEEP OFF THE GRASS</p>
<p>My life is not as happy as it was.</p>
<p>Saturday</p>
<p>The new creature eats too much fruit. We are going to run short, most
likely. “We“ again–that is its word; mine too, now, from hearing it so
much. Good deal of fog this morning. I do not go out in the fog myself.
The new creature does. It goes out in all weathers, and stumps right in
with its muddy feet. And talks. It used to be so pleasant and quiet
here.</p>
<p>Sunday</p>
<p>Pulled through. This day is getting to be more and more trying. It
was selected and set apart last November as a day of rest. I already had
six of them per week, before. This morning found the new creature trying
to clod apples out of that forbidden tree.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>The new creature says its name is Eve. That is all right, I have no
objections. Says it is to call it by when I want it to come. I said it
was superfluous, then. The word evidently raised me in its respect; and
indeed it is a large, good word, and will bear repetition. It says it is
not an It, it is a She. This is probably doubtful; yet it is all one to
me; what she is were nothing to me if she would but go by herself and
not talk.</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>She has littered the whole estate with execrable names and offensive
signs:</p>
<p>THIS WAY TO THE WHIRLPOOL.</p>
<p>THIS WAY TO GOAT ISLAND.</p>
<p>CAVE OF THE WINDS THIS WAY.</p>
<p>She says this park would make a tidy summer resort, if there was any
custom for it. Summer resort–another invention of hers–just words,
without any meaning. What is a summer resort? But it is best not to ask
her, she has such a rage for explaining.</p>
<p>Friday</p>
<p>She has taken to beseeching me to stop going over the Falls. What
harm does it do? Says it makes her shudder. I wonder why. I have always
done it–always liked the plunge, and the excitement, and the coolness. I
supposed it was what the Falls were for. They have no other use that I
can see, and they must have been made for something. She says they were
only made for scenery–like the rhinoceros and the mastodon.</p>
<p>I went over the Falls in a barrel–not satisfactory to her. Went over
in a tub–still not satisfactory. Swam the Whirlpool and the Rapids in a
fig-leaf suit. It got much damaged. Hence, tedious complaints about my
extravagance. I am too much hampered here. What I need is change of
scene.</p>
<p>Saturday</p>
<p>I escaped last Tuesday night, and travelled two days, and built me
another shelter, in a secluded place, and obliterated my tracks as well
as I could, but she hunted me out by means of a beast which she has
tamed and calls a wolf, and came making that pitiful noise again, and
shedding that water out of the places she looks with. I was obliged to
return with her, but will presently emigrate again, when occasion
offers. She engages herself in many foolish things: among others, trying
to study out why the animals called lions and tigers live on grass and
flowers, when, as she says, the sort of teeth they wear would indicate
that they were intended to eat each other. This is foolish, because to
do that would be to kill each other, and that would introduce what, as I
understand it, is called “death;“ and death, as I have been told, has
not yet entered the Park. Which is a pity, on some accounts.</p>
<p>Sunday</p>
<p>Pulled through.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>I believe I see what the week is for: it is to give time to rest up
from the weariness of Sunday. It seems a good idea…. She has been
climbing that tree again. Clodded her out of it. She said nobody was
looking. Seems to consider that a sufficient justification for chancing
any dangerous thing. Told her that. The word justification moved her
admiration–and envy too, I thought. It is a good word.</p>
<p>Thursday</p>
<p>She told me she was made out of a rib taken from my body. This is at
least doubtful, if not more than that. I have not missed any rib…. She
is in much trouble about the buzzard; says grass does not agree with it;
is afraid she can’t raise it; thinks it was intended to live on decayed
flesh. The buzzard must get along the best it can with what is provided.
We cannot overturn the whole scheme to accommodate the buzzard.</p>
<p>Saturday</p>
<p>She fell in the pond yesterday, when she was looking at herself in
it, which she is always doing. She nearly strangled, and said it was
most uncomfortable. This made her sorry for the creatures which live in
there, which she calls fish, for she continues to fasten names on to
things that don’t need them and don’t come when they are called by them,
which is a matter of no consequence to her, as she is such a numskull
anyway; so she got a lot of them out and brought them in last night and
put them in my bed to keep warm, but I have noticed them now and then
all day, and I don’t see that they are any happier there than they were
before, only quieter. When night comes I shall throw them out-doors. I
will not sleep with them again, for I find them clammy and unpleasant to
lie among when a person hasn’t anything on.</p>
<p>Sunday</p>
<p>Pulled through.</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>She has taken up with a snake now. The other animals are glad, for
she was always experimenting with them and bothering them; and I am
glad, because the snake talks, and this enables me to get a rest.</p>
<p>Friday</p>
<p>She says the snake advises her to try the fruit of that tree, and
says the result will be a great and fine and noble education. I told her
there would be another result, too–it would introduce death into the
world. That was a mistake–it had been better to keep the remark to
myself; it only gave her an idea–she could save the sick buzzard, and
furnish fresh meat to the despondent lions and tigers. I advised her to
keep away from the tree. She said she wouldn’t. I foresee trouble. Will
emigrate.</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>I have had a variegated time. I escaped that night, and rode a horse
all night as fast as he could go, hoping to get clear out of the Park
and hide in some other country before the trouble should begin; but it
was not to be. About an hour after sunup, as I was riding through a
flowery plain where thousands of animals were grazing, slumbering, or
playing with each other, according to their wont, all of a sudden they
broke into a tempest of frightful noises, and in one moment the plain
was in a frantic commotion and every beast was destroying its neighbor.
I knew what it meant–Eve had eaten that fruit, and death was come into
the world…. The tigers ate my horse, paying no attention when I ordered
them to desist, and they would even have eaten me if I had stayed–which
I didn’t, but went away in much haste…. I found this place, outside the
Park, and was fairly comfortable for a few days, but she has found me
out. Found me out, and has named the place Tonawanda–says it looks like
that. In fact, I was not sorry she came, for there are but meagre
pickings here, and she brought some of those apples. I was obliged to
eat them, I was so hungry. It was against my principles, but I find that
principles have no real force except when one is well fed…. She came
curtained in boughs and bunches of leaves, and when I asked her what she
meant by such nonsense, and snatched them away and threw them down, she
tittered and blushed. I had never seen a person titter and blush before,
and to me it seemed unbecoming and idiotic. She said I would soon know
how it was myself. This was correct. Hungry as I was, I laid down the
apple half eaten–certainly the best one I ever saw, considering the
lateness of the season–and arrayed myself in the discarded boughs and
branches, and then spoke to her with some severity and ordered her to go
and get some more and not make such a spectacle of herself. She did it,
and after this we crept down to where the wild-beast battle had been,
and collected some skins, and I made her patch together a couple of
suits proper for public occasions. They are uncomfortable, it is true,
but stylish, and that is the main point about clothes. … I find she is a
good deal of a companion. I see I should be lonesome and depressed
without her, now that I have lost my property. Another thing, she says
it is ordered that we work for our living hereafter. She will be useful.
I will superintend.</p>
<p>Ten Days Later</p>
<p>She accuses me of being the cause of our disaster! She says, with
apparent sincerity and truth, that the Serpent assured her that the
forbidden fruit was not apples, it was chestnuts. I said I was innocent,
then, for I had not eaten any chestnuts. She said the Serpent informed
her that “chestnut“ was a figurative term meaning an aged and mouldy
joke. I turned pale at that, for I have made many jokes to pass the
weary time, and some of them could have been of that sort, though I had
honestly supposed that they were new when I made them. She asked me if I
had made one just at the time of the catastrophe. I was obliged to admit
that I had made one to myself, though not aloud. It was this. I was
thinking about the Falls, and I said to myself, “How wonderful it is to
see that vast body of water tumble down there!“ Then in an instant a
bright thought flashed into my head, and I let it fly, saying, “It would
be a deal more wonderful to see it tumble up there!“–and I was just
about to kill myself with laughing at it when all nature broke loose in
war and death, and I had to flee for my life. “There,“ she said, with
triumph, “that is just it; the Serpent mentioned that very jest, and
called it the First Chestnut, and said it was coeval with the creation.“
Alas, I am indeed to blame. Would that I were not witty; oh, would that
I had never had that radiant thought!</p>
<p>Next Year</p>
<p>We have named it Cain. She caught it while I was up country trapping
on the North Shore of the Erie; caught it in the timber a couple of
miles from our dug-out–or it might have been four, she isn’t certain
which. It resembles us in some ways, and may be a relation. That is what
she thinks, but this is an error, in my judgment. The difference in size
warrants the conclusion that it is a different and new kind of animal–a
fish, perhaps, though when I put it in the water to see, it sank, and
she plunged in and snatched it out before there was opportunity for the
experiment to determine the matter. I still think it is a fish, but she
is indifferent about what it is, and will not let me have it to try. I
do not understand this. The coming of the creature seems to have changed
her whole nature and made her unreasonable about experiments. She thinks
more of it than she does of any of the other animals, but is not able to
explain why. Her mind is disordered–everything shows it. Sometimes she
carries the fish in her arms half the night when it complains and wants
to get to the water. At such times the water comes out of the places in
her face that she looks out of, and she pats the fish on the back and
makes soft sounds with her mouth to soothe it, and betrays sorrow and
solicitude in a hundred ways. I have never seen her do like this with
any other fish, and it troubles me greatly. She used to carry the young
tigers around so, and play with them, before we lost our property; but
it was only play; she never took on about them like this when their
dinner disagreed with them.</p>
<p>Sunday</p>
<p>She doesn’t work Sundays, but lies around all tired out, and likes to
have the fish wallow over her; and she makes fool noises to amuse it,
and pretends to chew its paws, and that makes it laugh. I have not seen
a fish before that could laugh. This makes me doubt…. I have come to
like Sunday myself. Superintending all the week tires a body so. There
ought to be more Sundays. In the old days they were tough, but now they
come handy.</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>It isn’t a fish. I cannot quite make out what it is. It makes
curious, devilish noises when not satisfied, and says “goo-goo“ when it
is. It is not one of us, for it doesn’t walk; it is not a bird, for it
doesn’t fly; it is not a frog, for it doesn’t hop; it is not a snake,
for it doesn’t crawl; I feel sure it is not a fish, though I cannot get
a chance to find out whether it can swim or not. It merely lies around,
and mostly on its back, with its feet up. I have not seen any other
animal do that before. I said I believed it was an enigma, but she only
admired the word without understanding it. In my judgment it is either
an enigma or some kind of a bug. If it dies, I will take it apart and
see what its arrangements are. I never had a thing perplex me so.</p>
<p>Three Months Later</p>
<p>The perplexity augments instead of diminishing. I sleep but little.
It has ceased from lying around, and goes about on its four legs now.
Yet it differs from the other four-legged animals in that its front legs
are unusually short, consequently this causes the main part of its
person to stick up uncomfortably high in the air, and this is not
attractive. It is built much as we are, but its method of travelling
shows that it is not of our breed. The short front legs and long hind
ones indicate that it is of the kangaroo family, but it is a marked
variation of the species, since the true kangaroo hops, whereas this one
never does. Still, it is a curious and interesting variety, and has not
been catalogued before. As I discovered it, I have felt justified in
securing the credit of the discovery by attaching my name to it, and
hence have called it Kangaroorum Adamiensis…. It must have been a young
one when it came, for it has grown exceedingly since. It must be five
times as big, now, as it was then, and when discontented is able to make
from twenty-two to thirty-eight times the noise it made at first.
Coercion does not modify this, but has the contrary effect. For this
reason I discontinued the system. She reconciles it by persuasion, and
by giving it things which she had previously told it she wouldn’t give
it. As already observed, I was not at home when it first came, and she
told me she found it in the woods. It seems odd that it should be the
only one, yet it must be so, for I have worn myself out these many weeks
trying to find another one to add to my collection, and for this one to
play with; for surely then it would be quieter, and we could tame it
more easily. But I find none, nor any vestige of any; and strangest of
all, no tracks. It has to live on the ground, it cannot help itself;
therefore, how does it get about without leaving a track? I have set a
dozen traps, but they do no good. I catch all small animals except that
one; animals that merely go into the trap out of curiosity, I think, to
see what the milk is there for. They never drink it.</p>
<p>Three Months Later</p>
<p>The kangaroo still continues to grow, which is very strange and
perplexing. I never knew one to be so long getting its growth. It has
fur on its head now; not like kangaroo fur, but exactly like our hair,
except that it is much finer and softer, and instead of being black is
red. I am like to lose my mind over the capricious and harassing
developments of this unclassifiable zoological freak. If I could catch
another one–but that is hopeless; it is a new variety, and the only
sample; this is plain. But I caught a true kangaroo and brought it in,
thinking that this one, being lonesome, would rather have that for
company than have no kin at all, or any animal it could feel a nearness
to or get sympathy from in its forlorn condition here among strangers
who do not know its ways or habits, or what to do to make it feel that
it is among friends; but it was a mistake–it went into such fits at the
sight of the kangaroo that I was convinced it had never seen one before.
I pity the poor noisy little animal, but there is nothing I can do to
make it happy. If I could tame it–but that is out of the question; the
more I try, the worse I seem to make it. It grieves me to the heart to
see it in its little storms of sorrow and passion. I wanted to let it
go, but she wouldn’t hear of it. That seemed cruel and not like her; and
yet she may be right. It might be lonelier than ever; for since I cannot
find another one, how could it?</p>
<p>Five Months Later</p>
<p>It is not a kangaroo. No, for it supports itself by holding to her
finger, and thus goes a few steps on its hind legs, and then falls down.
It is probably some kind of a bear; and yet it has no tail–as yet–and no
fur, except on its head. It still keeps on growing–that is a curious
circumstance, for bears get their growth earlier than this. Bears are
dangerous–since our catastrophe–and I shall not be satisfied to have
this one prowling about the place much longer without a muzzle on. I
have offered to get her a kangaroo if she would let this one go, but it
did no good–she is determined to run us into all sorts of foolish risks,
I think. She was not like this before she lost her mind.</p>
<p>A Fortnight Later</p>
<p>I examined its mouth. There is no danger yet; it has only one tooth.
It has no tail yet. It makes more noise now than it ever did before–and
mainly at night. I have moved out. But I shall go over, mornings, to
breakfast, and to see if it has more teeth. If it gets a mouthful of
teeth, it will be time for it to go, tail or no tail, for a bear does
not need a tail in order to be dangerous.</p>
<p>Four Months Later</p>
<p>I have been off hunting and fishing a month, up in the region that
she calls Buffalo; I don’t know why, unless it is because there are not
any buffaloes there. Meantime the bear has learned to paddle around all
by itself on its hind legs, and says “poppa“ and “momma.“ It is
certainly a new species. This resemblance to words may be purely
accidental, of course, and may have no purpose or meaning; but even in
that case it is still extraordinary, and is a thing which no other bear
can do. This imitation of speech, taken together with general absence of
fur and entire absence of tail, sufficiently indicates that this is a
new kind of bear. The further study of it will be exceedingly
interesting. Meantime I will go off on a far expedition among the
forests of the North and make an exhaustive search. There must certainly
be another one somewhere, and this one will be less dangerous when it
has company of its own species. I will go straightway; but I will muzzle
this one first.</p>
<p>Three Months Later</p>
<p>It has been a weary, weary hunt, yet I have had no success. In the
mean time, without stirring from the home estate, she has caught another
one! I never saw such luck. I might have hunted these woods a hundred
years, I never should have run across that thing.</p>
<p>Next Day</p>
<p>I have been comparing the new one with the old one, and it is
perfectly plain that they are the same breed. I was going to stuff one
of them for my collection, but she is prejudiced against it for some
reason or other; so I have relinquished the idea, though I think it is a
mistake. It would be an irreparable loss to science if they should get
away. The old one is tamer than it was, and can laugh and talk like the
parrot, having learned this, no doubt, from being with the parrot so
much, and having the imitative faculty in a highly developed degree. I
shall be astonished if it turns out to be a new kind of parrot, and yet
I ought not to be astonished, for it has already been everything else it
could think of, since those first days when it was a fish. The new one
is as ugly now as the old one was at first; has the same
sulphur-and-raw-meat complexion and the same singular head without any
fur on it. She calls it Abel.</p>
<p>Ten Years Later</p>
<p>They are boys; we found it out long ago. It was their coming in that
small, immature shape that puzzled us; we were not used to it. There are
some girls now. Abel is a good boy, but if Cain had stayed a bear it
would have improved him. After all these years, I see that I was
mistaken about Eve in the beginning; it is better to live outside the
Garden with her than inside it without her. At first I thought she
talked too much; but now I should be sorry to have that voice fall
silent and pass out of my life. Blessed be the chestnut that brought us
near together and taught me to know the goodness of her heart and the
sweetness of her spirit!</p>
