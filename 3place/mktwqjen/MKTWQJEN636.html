<h4 id="treachery-conquers-joan">40 Treachery Conquers Joan</h4>
<p>COURIER after courier was despatched to the King, and he promised to
come, but didn’t. The Duke d’Alencon went to him and got his promise
again, which he broke again. Nine days were lost thus; then he came,
arriving at St. Denis September 7th.</p>
<p>Meantime the enemy had begun to take heart: the spiritless conduct of
the King could have no other result. Preparations had now been made to
defend the city. Joan’s chances had been diminished, but she and her
generals considered them plenty good enough yet. Joan ordered the attack
for eight o’clock next morning, and at that hour it began.</p>
<p>Joan placed her artillery and began to pound a strong work which
protected the gate St. Honor,. When it was sufficiently crippled the
assault was sounded at noon, and it was carried by storm. Then we moved
forward to storm the gate itself, and hurled ourselves against it again
and again, Joan in the lead with her standard at her side, the smoke
enveloping us in choking clouds, and the missiles flying over us and
through us as thick as hail.</p>
<p>In the midst of our last assault, which would have carried the gate
sure and given us Paris and in effect France, Joan was struck down by a
crossbow bolt, and our men fell back instantly and almost in a panic–for
what were they without her? She was the army, herself.</p>
<p>Although disabled, she refused to retire, and begged that a new
assault be made, saying it must win; and adding, with the battle-light
rising in her eyes, “I will take Paris now or die!“ She had to be
carried away by force, and this was done by Gaucourt and the Duke
d’Alencon.</p>
<p>But her spirits were at the very top notch, now. She was brimming
with enthusiasm. She said she would be carried before the gate in the
morning, and in half an hour Paris would be ours without any question.
She could have kept her word. About this there was no doubt. But she
forgot one factor–the King, shadow of that substance named La
Tremouille. The King forbade the attempt!</p>
<p>You see, a new Embassy had just come from the Duke of Burgundy, and
another sham private trade of some sort was on foot.</p>
<p>You would know, without my telling you, that Joan’s heart was nearly
broken. Because of the pain of her wound and the pain at her heart she
slept little that night. Several times the watchers heard muffled sobs
from the dark room where she lay at St. Denis, and many times the
grieving words, “It could have been taken!–it could have been taken!“
which were the only ones she said.</p>
<p>She dragged herself out of bed a day later with a new hope. D’Alencon
had thrown a bridge across the Seine near St. Denis. Might she not cross
by that and assault Paris at another point? But the King got wind of it
and broke the bridge down! And more–he declared the campaign ended! And
more still–he had made a new truce and a long one, in which he had
agreed to leave Paris unthreatened and unmolested, and go back to the
Loire whence he had come!</p>
<p>Joan of Arc, who had never been defeated by the enemy, was defeated
by her own King. She had said once that all she feared for her cause was
treachery. It had struck its first blow now. She hung up her white armor
in the royal basilica of St. Denis, and went and asked the King to
relieve her of her functions and let her go home. As usual, she was
wise. Grand combinations, far-reaching great military moves were at an
end, now; for the future, when the truce should end, the war would be
merely a war of random and idle skirmishes, apparently; work suitable
for subalterns, and not requiring the supervision of a sublime military
genius. But the King would not let her go. The truce did not embrace all
France; there were French strongholds to be watched and preserved; he
would need her. Really, you see, Tremouille wanted to keep her where he
could balk and hinder her.</p>
<p>Now came her Voices again. They said, “Remain at St. Denis.“ There
was no explanation. They did not say why. That was the voice of God; it
took precedence of the command of the King; Joan resolved to stay. But
that filled La Tremouille with dread. She was too tremendous a force to
be left to herself; she would surely defeat all his plans. He beguiled
the King to use compulsion. Joan had to submit–because she was wounded
and helpless. In the Great Trial she said she was carried away against
her will; and that if she had not been wounded it could not have been
accomplished. Ah, she had a spirit, that slender girl! a spirit to brave
all earthly powers and defy them. We shall never know why the Voices
ordered her to stay. We only know this; that if she could have obeyed,
the history of France would not be as it now stands written in the
books. Yes, well we know that.</p>
<p>On the 13th of September the army, sad and spiritless, turned its
face toward the Loire, and marched–without music! Yes, one noted that
detail. It was a funeral march; that is what it was. A long, dreary
funeral march, with never a shout or a cheer; friends looking on in
tears, all the way, enemies laughing. We reached Gien at last–that place
whence we had set out on our splendid march toward Rheims less than
three months before, with flags flying, bands playing, the victory-flush
of Patay glowing in our faces, and the massed multitudes shouting and
praising and giving us godspeed. There was a dull rain falling now, the
day was dark, the heavens mourned, the spectators were few, we had no
welcome but the welcome of silence, and pity, and tears.</p>
<p>Then the King disbanded that noble army of heroes; it furled its
flags, it stored its arms: the disgrace of France was complete. La
Tremouille wore the victor’s crown; Joan of Arc, the unconquerable, was
conquered.</p>
