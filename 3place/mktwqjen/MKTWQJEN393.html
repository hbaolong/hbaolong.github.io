<h4 id="chapter-10-completing-my-education">Chapter 10 Completing My
Education</h4>
<p>WHOSOEVER has done me the courtesy to read my chapters which have
preceded this may possibly wonder that I deal so minutely with piloting
as a science. It was the prime purpose of those chapters; and I am not
quite done yet. I wish to show, in the most patient and painstaking way,
what a wonderful science it is. Ship channels are buoyed and lighted,
and therefore it is a comparatively easy undertaking to learn to run
them; clear-water rivers, with gravel bottoms, change their channels
very gradually, and therefore one needs to learn them but once; but
piloting becomes another matter when you apply it to vast streams like
the Mississippi and the Missouri, whose alluvial banks cave and change
constantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose
sandbars are never at rest, whose channels are for ever dodging and
shirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted in all nights and
all weathers without the aid of a single light-house or a single buoy;
for there is neither light nor buoy to be found anywhere in all this
three or four thousand miles of villainous river.{footnote [True at the
time referred to; not true now (1882).]} I feel justified in enlarging
upon this great science for the reason that I feel sure no one has ever
yet written a paragraph about it who had piloted a steamboat himself,
and so had a practical knowledge of the subject. If the theme were
hackneyed, I should be obliged to deal gently with the reader; but since
it is wholly new, I have felt at liberty to take up a considerable
degree of room with it.</p>
<p>When I had learned the name and position of every visible feature of
the river; when I had so mastered its shape that I could shut my eyes
and trace it from St. Louis to New Orleans; when I had learned to read
the face of the water as one would cull the news from the morning paper;
and finally, when I had trained my dull memory to treasure up an endless
array of soundings and crossing-marks, and keep fast hold of them, I
judged that my education was complete: so I got to tilting my cap to the
side of my head, and wearing a tooth-pick in my mouth at the wheel.
Mr. Bixby had his eye on these airs. One day he said–</p>
<p>‘What is the height of that bank yonder, at Burgess’s?’</p>
<p>‘How can I tell, sir. It is three-quarters of a mile away.’</p>
<p>‘Very poor eye–very poor. Take the glass.’</p>
<p>I took the glass, and presently said–‘I can’t tell. I suppose that
that bank is about a foot and a half high.’</p>
<p>‘Foot and a half! That’s a six-foot bank. How high was the bank along
here last trip?’</p>
<p>‘I don’t know; I never noticed.’</p>
<p>‘You didn’t? Well, you must always do it hereafter.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>‘Because you’ll have to know a good many things that it tells you.
For one thing, it tells you the stage of the river–tells you whether
there’s more water or less in the river along here than there was last
trip.’</p>
<p>‘The leads tell me that.’ I rather thought I had the advantage of him
there.</p>
<p>‘Yes, but suppose the leads lie? The bank would tell you so, and then
you’d stir those leadsmen up a bit. There was a ten-foot bank here last
trip, and there is only a six-foot bank now. What does that
signify?’</p>
<p>‘That the river is four feet higher than it was last trip.’</p>
<p>‘Very good. Is the river rising or falling?’</p>
<p>‘Rising.’</p>
<p>‘No it ain’t.’</p>
<p>‘I guess I am right, sir. Yonder is some drift-wood floating down the
stream.’</p>
<p>‘A rise starts the drift-wood, but then it keeps on floating a while
after the river is done rising. Now the bank will tell you about this.
Wait till you come to a place where it shelves a little. Now here; do
you see this narrow belt of fine sediment That was deposited while the
water was higher. You see the driftwood begins to strand, too. The bank
helps in other ways. Do you see that stump on the false point?’</p>
<p>‘Ay, ay, sir.’</p>
<p>‘Well, the water is just up to the roots of it. You must make a note
of that.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>‘Because that means that there’s seven feet in the chute of 103.’</p>
<p>‘But 103 is a long way up the river yet.’</p>
<p>‘That’s where the benefit of the bank comes in. There is water enough
in 103 NOW, yet there may not be by the time we get there; but the bank
will keep us posted all along. You don’t run close chutes on a falling
river, up-stream, and there are precious few of them that you are
allowed to run at all down-stream. There’s a law of the United States
against it. The river may be rising by the time we get to 103, and in
that case we’ll run it. We are drawing–how much?’</p>
<p>‘Six feet aft,–six and a half forward.’</p>
<p>‘Well, you do seem to know something.’</p>
<p>‘But what I particularly want to know is, if I have got to keep up an
everlasting measuring of the banks of this river, twelve hundred miles,
month in and month out?’</p>
<p>‘Of course!’</p>
<p>My emotions were too deep for words for a while. Presently I
said–’</p>
<p>And how about these chutes. Are there many of them?’</p>
<p>‘I should say so. I fancy we shan’t run any of the river this trip as
you’ve ever seen it run before–so to speak. If the river begins to rise
again, we’ll go up behind bars that you’ve always seen standing out of
the river, high and dry like the roof of a house; we’ll cut across low
places that you’ve never noticed at all, right through the middle of
bars that cover three hundred acres of river; we’ll creep through cracks
where you’ve always thought was solid land; we’ll dart through the woods
and leave twenty-five miles of river off to one side; we’ll see the
hind-side of every island between New Orleans and Cairo.’</p>
<p>‘Then I’ve got to go to work and learn just as much more river as I
already know.’</p>
<p>‘Just about twice as much more, as near as you can come at it.’</p>
<p>‘Well, one lives to find out. I think I was a fool when I went into
this business.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, that is true. And you are yet. But you’ll not be when you’ve
learned it.’</p>
<p>‘Ah, I never can learn it.’</p>
<p>‘I will see that you DO.’</p>
<p>By and by I ventured again–</p>
<p>‘Have I got to learn all this thing just as I know the rest of the
river–shapes and all–and so I can run it at night?’</p>
<p>‘Yes. And you’ve got to have good fair marks from one end of the
river to the other, that will help the bank tell you when there is water
enough in each of these countless places–like that stump, you know. When
the river first begins to rise, you can run half a dozen of the deepest
of them; when it rises a foot more you can run another dozen; the next
foot will add a couple of dozen, and so on: so you see you have to know
your banks and marks to a dead moral certainty, and never get them
mixed; for when you start through one of those cracks, there’s no
backing out again, as there is in the big river; you’ve got to go
through, or stay there six months if you get caught on a falling river.
There are about fifty of these cracks which you can’t run at all except
when the river is brim full and over the banks.’</p>
<p>‘This new lesson is a cheerful prospect.’</p>
<p>‘Cheerful enough. And mind what I’ve just told you; when you start
into one of those places you’ve got to go through. They are too narrow
to turn around in, too crooked to back out of, and the shoal water is
always up at the head; never elsewhere. And the head of them is always
likely to be filling up, little by little, so that the marks you reckon
their depth by, this season, may not answer for next.’</p>
<p>‘Learn a new set, then, every year?’</p>
<p>‘Exactly. Cramp her up to the bar! What are you standing up through
the middle of the river for?’</p>
<p>The next few months showed me strange things. On the same day that we
held the conversation above narrated, we met a great rise coming down
the river. The whole vast face of the stream was black with drifting
dead logs, broken boughs, and great trees that had caved in and been
washed away. It required the nicest steering to pick one’s way through
this rushing raft, even in the day-time, when crossing from point to
point; and at night the difficulty was mightily increased; every now and
then a huge log, lying deep in the water, would suddenly appear right
under our bows, coming head-on; no use to try to avoid it then; we could
only stop the engines, and one wheel would walk over that log from one
end to the other, keeping up a thundering racket and careening the boat
in a way that was very uncomfortable to passengers. Now and then we
would hit one of these sunken logs a rattling bang, dead in the center,
with a full head of steam, and it would stun the boat as if she had hit
a continent. Sometimes this log would lodge, and stay right across our
nose, and back the Mississippi up before it; we would have to do a
little craw-fishing, then, to get away from the obstruction. We often
hit WHITE logs, in the dark, for we could not see them till we were
right on them; but a black log is a pretty distinct object at night. A
white snag is an ugly customer when the daylight is gone.</p>
<p>Of course, on the great rise, down came a swarm of prodigious timber-
rafts from the head waters of the Mississippi, coal barges from
Pittsburgh, little trading scows from everywhere, and broad-horns from
‘Posey County,’ Indiana, freighted with ‘fruit and furniture’–the usual
term for describing it, though in plain English the freight thus
aggrandized was hoop-poles and pumpkins. Pilots bore a mortal hatred to
these craft; and it was returned with usury. The law required all such
helpless traders to keep a light burning, but it was a law that was
often broken. All of a sudden, on a murky night, a light would hop up,
right under our bows, almost, and an agonized voice, with the backwoods
‘whang’ to it, would wail out–</p>
<p>‘Whar’n the —- you goin’ to! Cain’t you see nothin’, you dash-dashed
aig-suckin’, sheep-stealin’, one-eyed son of a stuffed monkey!’</p>
<p>Then for an instant, as we whistled by, the red glare from our
furnaces would reveal the scow and the form of the gesticulating orator
as if under a lightning-flash, and in that instant our firemen and
deck-hands would send and receive a tempest of missiles and profanity,
one of our wheels would walk off with the crashing fragments of a
steering-oar, and down the dead blackness would shut again. And that
flatboatman would be sure to go into New Orleans and sue our boat,
swearing stoutly that he had a light burning all the time, when in truth
his gang had the lantern down below to sing and lie and drink and gamble
by, and no watch on deck. Once, at night, in one of those
forest-bordered crevices (behind an island) which steamboatmen intensely
describe with the phrase ‘as dark as the inside of a cow,’ we should
have eaten up a Posey County family, fruit, furniture, and all, but that
they happened to be fiddling down below, and we just caught the sound of
the music in time to sheer off, doing no serious damage, unfortunately,
but coming so near it that we had good hopes for a moment. These people
brought up their lantern, then, of course; and as we backed and filled
to get away, the precious family stood in the light of it–both sexes and
various ages–and cursed us till everything turned blue. Once a
coalboatman sent a bullet through our pilot-house, when we borrowed a
steering oar of him in a very narrow place.</p>
