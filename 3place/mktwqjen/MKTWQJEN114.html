<h4 id="chapter-xlix.">CHAPTER XLIX.</h4>
<p>An extract or two from the newspapers of the day will furnish a
photograph that can need no embellishment:</p>
<p>FATAL SHOOTING AFFRAY.–An affray occurred, last evening, in a
billiard saloon on C street, between Deputy Marshal Jack Williams and
Wm. Brown, which resulted in the immediate death of the latter. There
had been some difficulty between the parties for several months.</p>
<p>An inquest was immediately held, and the following testimony
adduced:</p>
<p>Officer GEO. BIRDSALL, sworn, says:–I was told Wm. Brown was drunk
and was looking for Jack Williams; so soon as I heard that I started for
the parties to prevent a collision; went into the billiard saloon; saw
Billy Brown running around, saying if anybody had anything against him
to show cause; he was talking in a boisterous manner, and officer Perry
took him to the other end of the room to talk to him; Brown came back to
me; remarked to me that he thought he was as good as anybody, and knew
how to take care of himself; he passed by me and went to the bar; don’t
know whether he drank or not; Williams was at the end of the
billiard-table, next to the stairway; Brown, after going to the bar,
came back and said he was as good as any man in the world; he had then
walked out to the end of the first billiard-table from the bar; I moved
closer to them, supposing there would be a fight; as Brown drew his
pistol I caught hold of it; he had fired one shot at Williams; don’t
know the effect of it; caught hold of him with one hand, and took hold
of the pistol and turned it up; think he fired once after I caught hold
of the pistol; I wrenched the pistol from him; walked to the end of the
billiard-table and told a party that I had Brown’s pistol, and to stop
shooting; I think four shots were fired in all; after walking out,
Mr. Foster remarked that Brown was shot dead.</p>
<p>Oh, there was no excitement about it–he merely “remarked“ the small
circumstance!</p>
<p>Four months later the following item appeared in the same paper (the
Enterprise). In this item the name of one of the city officers above
referred to (Deputy Marshal Jack Williams) occurs again:</p>
<p>ROBBERY AND DESPERATE AFFRAY.–On Tuesday night, a German named
Charles Hurtzal, engineer in a mill at Silver City, came to this place,
and visited the hurdy-gurdy house on B street. The music, dancing and
Teutonic maidens awakened memories of Faderland until our German friend
was carried away with rapture. He evidently had money, and was spending
if freely. Late in the evening Jack Williams and Andy Blessington
invited him down stairs to take a cup of coffee. Williams proposed a
game of cards and went up stairs to procure a deck, but not finding any
returned. On the stairway he met the German, and drawing his pistol
knocked him down and rifled his pockets of some seventy dollars. Hurtzal
dared give no alarm, as he was told, with a pistol at his head, if he
made any noise or exposed them, they would blow his brains out. So
effectually was he frightened that he made no complaint, until his
friends forced him. Yesterday a warrant was issued, but the culprits had
disappeared.</p>
<p>This efficient city officer, Jack Williams, had the common reputation
of being a burglar, a highwayman and a desperado. It was said that he
had several times drawn his revolver and levied money contributions on
citizens at dead of night in the public streets of Virginia.</p>
<p>Five months after the above item appeared, Williams was assassinated
while sitting at a card table one night; a gun was thrust through the
crack of the door and Williams dropped from his chair riddled with
balls. It was said, at the time, that Williams had been for some time
aware that a party of his own sort (desperadoes) had sworn away his
life; and it was generally believed among the people that Williams’s
friends and enemies would make the assassination memorable–and useful,
too–by a wholesale destruction of each other.</p>
<p>It did not so happen, but still, times were not dull during the next
twenty-four hours, for within that time a woman was killed by a pistol
shot, a man was brained with a slung shot, and a man named Reeder was
also disposed of permanently. Some matters in the Enterprise account of
the killing of Reeder are worth nothing–especially the accommodating
complaisance of a Virginia justice of the peace. The italics in the
following narrative are mine:</p>
<p>MORE CUTTING AND SHOOTING.–The devil seems to have again broken loose
in our town. Pistols and guns explode and knives gleam in our streets as
in early times. When there has been a long season of quiet, people are
slow to wet their hands in blood; but once blood is spilled, cutting and
shooting come easy. Night before last Jack Williams was assassinated,
and yesterday forenoon we had more bloody work, growing out of the
killing of Williams, and on the same street in which he met his death.
It appears that Tom Reeder, a friend of Williams, and George Gumbert
were talking, at the meat market of the latter, about the killing of
Williams the previous night, when Reeder said it was a most cowardly act
to shoot a man in such a way, giving him “no show.“ Gumbert said that
Williams had “as good a show as he gave Billy Brown,“ meaning the man
killed by Williams last March. Reeder said it was a d—d lie, that
Williams had no show at all. At this, Gumbert drew a knife and stabbed
Reeder, cutting him in two places in the back. One stroke of the knife
cut into the sleeve of Reeder’s coat and passed downward in a slanting
direction through his clothing, and entered his body at the small of the
back; another blow struck more squarely, and made a much more dangerous
wound. Gumbert gave himself up to the officers of justice, and was
shortly after discharged by Justice Atwill, on his own recognizance, to
appear for trial at six o’clock in the evening. In the meantime Reeder
had been taken into the office of Dr. Owens, where his wounds were
properly dressed. One of his wounds was considered quite dangerous, and
it was thought by many that it would prove fatal. But being considerably
under the influence of liquor, Reeder did not feel his wounds as he
otherwise would, and he got up and went into the street. He went to the
meat market and renewed his quarrel with Gumbert, threatening his life.
Friends tried to interfere to put a stop to the quarrel and get the
parties away from each other. In the Fashion Saloon Reeder made threats
against the life of Gumbert, saying he would kill him, and it is said
that he requested the officers not to arrest Gumbert, as he intended to
kill him. After these threats Gumbert went off and procured a
double-barreled shot gun, loaded with buck-shot or revolver balls, and
went after Reeder. Two or three persons were assisting him along the
street, trying to get him home, and had him just in front of the store
of Klopstock andandandand Harris, when Gumbert came across toward him
from the opposite side of the street with his gun. He came up within
about ten or fifteen feet of Reeder, and called out to those with him to
“look out! get out of the way!“ and they had only time to heed the
warning, when he fired. Reeder was at the time attempting to screen
himself behind a large cask, which stood against the awning post of
Klopstock andandandand Harris’s store, but some of the balls took effect
in the lower part of his breast, and he reeled around forward and fell
in front of the cask. Gumbert then raised his gun and fired the second
barrel, which missed Reeder and entered the ground. At the time that
this occurred, there were a great many persons on the street in the
vicinity, and a number of them called out to Gumbert, when they saw him
raise his gun, to “hold on,“ and “don’t shoot!“ The cutting took place
about ten o’clock and the shooting about twelve. After the shooting the
street was instantly crowded with the inhabitants of that part of the
town, some appearing much excited and laughing–declaring that it looked
like the “good old times of ’60.“ Marshal Perry and officer Birdsall
were near when the shooting occurred, and Gumbert was immediately
arrested and his gun taken from him, when he was marched off to jail.
Many persons who were attracted to the spot where this bloody work had
just taken place, looked bewildered and seemed to be asking themselves
what was to happen next, appearing in doubt as to whether the killing
mania had reached its climax, or whether we were to turn in and have a
grand killing spell, shooting whoever might have given us offence. It
was whispered around that it was not all over yet –five or six more were
to be killed before night. Reeder was taken to the Virginia City Hotel,
and doctors called in to examine his wounds. They found that two or
three balls had entered his right side; one of them appeared to have
passed through the substance of the lungs, while another passed into the
liver. Two balls were also found to have struck one of his legs. As some
of the balls struck the cask, the wounds in Reeder’s leg were probably
from these, glancing downwards, though they might have been caused by
the second shot fired. After being shot, Reeder said when he got on his
feet –smiling as he spoke–“It will take better shooting than that to
kill me.“ The doctors consider it almost impossible for him to recover,
but as he has an excellent constitution he may survive, notwithstanding
the number and dangerous character of the wounds he has received. The
town appears to be perfectly quiet at present, as though the late stormy
times had cleared our moral atmosphere; but who can tell in what quarter
clouds are lowering or plots ripening?</p>
<p>Reeder–or at least what was left of him–survived his wounds two days!
Nothing was ever done with Gumbert.</p>
<p>Trial by jury is the palladium of our liberties. I do not know what a
palladium is, having never seen a palladium, but it is a good thing no
doubt at any rate. Not less than a hundred men have been murdered in
Nevada–perhaps I would be within bounds if I said three hundred–and as
far as I can learn, only two persons have suffered the death penalty
there. However, four or five who had no money and no political influence
have been punished by imprisonment–one languished in prison as much as
eight months, I think. However, I do not desire to be extravagant–it may
have been less.</p>
<p>However, one prophecy was verified, at any rate. It was asserted by
the desperadoes that one of their brethren (Joe McGee, a special
policeman) was known to be the conspirator chosen by lot to assassinate
Williams; and they also asserted that doom had been pronounced against
McGee, and that he would be assassinated in exactly the same manner that
had been adopted for the destruction of Williams–a prophecy which came
true a year later. After twelve months of distress (for McGee saw a
fancied assassin in every man that approached him), he made the last of
many efforts to get out of the country unwatched. He went to Carson and
sat down in a saloon to wait for the stage–it would leave at four in the
morning. But as the night waned and the crowd thinned, he grew uneasy,
and told the bar-keeper that assassins were on his track. The bar-keeper
told him to stay in the middle of the room, then, and not go near the
door, or the window by the stove. But a fatal fascination seduced him to
the neighborhood of the stove every now and then, and repeatedly the
bar-keeper brought him back to the middle of the room and warned him to
remain there. But he could not. At three in the morning he again
returned to the stove and sat down by a stranger. Before the bar-keeper
could get to him with another warning whisper, some one outside fired
through the window and riddled McGee’s breast with slugs, killing him
almost instantly. By the same discharge the stranger at McGee’s side
also received attentions which proved fatal in the course of two or
three days.</p>
