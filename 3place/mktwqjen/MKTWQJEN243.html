<h4 id="the-curious-republic-of-gondour">THE CURIOUS REPUBLIC OF
GONDOUR</h4>
<p>As soon as I had learned to speak the language a little, I became
greatly interested in the people and the system of government.</p>
<p>I found that the nation had at first tried universal suffrage pure
and simple, but had thrown that form aside because the result was not
satisfactory. It had seemed to deliver all power into the hands of the
ignorant and non-tax-paying classes; and of a necessity the responsible
offices were filled from these classes also.</p>
<p>A remedy was sought. The people believed they had found it; not in
the destruction of universal suffrage, but in the enlargement of it. It
was an odd idea, and ingenious. You must understand, the constitution
gave every man a vote; therefore that vote was a vested right, and could
not be taken away. But the constitution did not say that certain
individuals might not be given two votes, or ten! So an amendatory
clause was inserted in a quiet way; a clause which authorised the
enlargement of the suffrage in certain cases to be specified by statute.
To offer to “limit“ the suffrage might have made instant trouble; the
offer to “enlarge“ it had a pleasant aspect. But of course the
newspapers soon began to suspect; and then out they came! It was found,
however, that for once–and for the first time in the history of the
republic –property, character, and intellect were able to wield a
political influence; for once, money, virtue, and intelligence took a
vital and a united interest in a political question; for once these
powers went to the “primaries“ in strong force; for once the best men in
the nation were put forward as candidates for that parliament whose
business it should be to enlarge the suffrage. The weightiest half of
the press quickly joined forces with the new movement, and left the
other half to rail about the proposed “destruction of the liberties“ of
the bottom layer of society, the hitherto governing class of the
community.</p>
<p>The victory was complete. The new law was framed and passed. Under it
every citizen, howsoever poor or ignorant, possessed one vote, so
universal suffrage still reigned; but if a man possessed a good
common-school education and no money, he had two votes; a high-school
education gave him four; if he had property like wise, to the value of
three thousand ‘sacos,’ he wielded one more vote; for every fifty
thousand ‘sacos’ a man added to his property, he was entitled to another
vote; a university education entitled a man to nine votes, even though
he owned no property. Therefore, learning being more prevalent and more
easily acquired than riches, educated men became a wholesome check upon
wealthy men, since they could outvote them. Learning goes usually with
uprightness, broad views, and humanity; so the learned voters,
possessing the balance of power, became the vigilant and efficient
protectors of the great lower rank of society.</p>
<p>And now a curious thing developed itself–a sort of emulation, whose
object was voting power! Whereas formerly a man was honored only
according to the amount of money he possessed, his grandeur was measured
now by the number of votes he wielded. A man with only one vote was
conspicuously respectful to his neighbor who possessed three. And if he
was a man above the common-place, he was as conspicuously energetic in
his determination to acquire three for himself. This spirit of emulation
invaded all ranks. Votes based upon capital were commonly called
“mortal“ votes, because they could be lost; those based upon learning
were called “immortal,“ because they were permanent, and because of
their customarily imperishable character they were naturally more valued
than the other sort. I say “customarily“ for the reason that these votes
were not absolutely imperishable, since insanity could suspend them.</p>
<p>Under this system, gambling and speculation almost ceased in the
republic. A man honoured as the possessor of great voting power could
not afford to risk the loss of it upon a doubtful chance.</p>
<p>It was curious to observe the manners and customs which the
enlargement plan produced. Walking the street with a friend one day he
delivered a careless bow to a passer-by, and then remarked that that
person possessed only one vote and would probably never earn another; he
was more respectful to the next acquaintance he met; he explained that
this salute was a four-vote bow. I tried to “average“ the importance of
the people he accosted after that, by the-nature of his bows, but my
success was only partial, because of the somewhat greater homage paid to
the immortals than to the mortals. My friend explained. He said there
was no law to regulate this thing, except that most powerful of all
laws, custom. Custom had created these varying bows, and in time they
had become easy and natural. At this moment he delivered himself of a
very profound salute, and then said, “Now there’s a man who began life
as a shoemaker’s apprentice, and without education; now he swings
twenty-two mortal votes and two immortal ones; he expects to pass a
high-school examination this year and climb a couple of votes higher
among the immortals; mighty valuable citizen.“</p>
<p>By and by my friend met a venerable personage, and not only made him
a most elaborate bow, but also took off his hat. I took off mine, too,
with a mysterious awe. I was beginning to be infected.</p>
<p>“What grandee is that?“</p>
<p>“That is our most illustrious astronomer. He hasn’t any money, but is
fearfully learned. Nine immortals is his political weight! He would
swing a hundred and fifty votes if our system were perfect.“</p>
<p>“Is there any altitude of mere moneyed grandeur that you take off
your hat to?“</p>
<p>“No. Nine immortal votes is the only power we uncover for that is, in
civil life. Very great officials receive that mark of homage, of
course.“</p>
<p>It was common to hear people admiringly mention men who had begun
life on the lower levels and in time achieved great voting-power. It was
also common to hear youths planning a future of ever so many votes for
themselves. I heard shrewd mammas speak of certain young men as good
“catches“ because they possessed such-and-such a number of votes. I knew
of more than one case where an heiress was married to a youngster who
had but one vote; the argument being that he was gifted with such
excellent parts that in time he would acquire a good voting strength,
and perhaps in the long run be able to outvote his wife, if he had
luck.</p>
<p>Competitive examinations were the rule and in all official grades. I
remarked that the questions asked the candidates were wild, intricate,
and often required a sort of knowledge not needed in the office
sought.</p>
<p>“Can a fool or an ignoramus answer them?“ asked the person I was
talking with.</p>
<p>“Certainly not.“</p>
<p>“Well, you will not find any fools or ignoramuses among our
officials.“</p>
<p>I felt rather cornered, but made shift to say:</p>
<p>“But these questions cover a good deal more ground than is
necessary.“</p>
<p>“No matter; if candidates can answer these it is tolerably fair
evidence that they can answer nearly any other question you choose to
ask them.“</p>
<p>There were some things in Gondour which one could not shut his eyes
to. One was, that ignorance and incompetence had no place in the
government. Brains and property managed the state. A candidate for
office must have marked ability, education, and high character, or he
stood no sort of chance of election. If a hod-carrier possessed these,
he could succeed; but the mere fact that he was a hod-carrier could not
elect him, as in previous times.</p>
<p>It was now a very great honour to be in the parliament or in office;
under the old system such distinction had only brought suspicion upon a
man and made him a helpless mark for newspaper contempt and scurrility.
Officials did not need to steal now, their salaries being vast in
comparison with the pittances paid in the days when parliaments were
created by hod-carriers, who viewed official salaries from a
hod-carrying point of view and compelled that view to be respected by
their obsequious servants. Justice was wisely and rigidly administered;
for a judge, after once reaching his place through the specified line of
promotions, was a permanency during good behaviour. He was not obliged
to modify his judgments according to the effect they might have upon the
temper of a reigning political party.</p>
<p>The country was mainly governed by a ministry which went out with the
administration that created it. This was also the case with the chiefs
of the great departments. Minor officials ascended to their several
positions through well-earned promotions, and not by a jump from
gin-mills or the needy families and friends of members of parliament.
Good behaviour measured their terms of office.</p>
<p>The head of the governments the Grand Caliph, was elected for a term
of twenty years. I questioned the wisdom of this. I was answered that he
could do no harm, since the ministry and the parliament governed the
land, and he was liable to impeachment for misconduct. This great office
had twice been ably filled by women, women as aptly fitted for it as
some of the sceptred queens of history. Members of the cabinet, under
many administrations, had been women.</p>
<p>I found that the pardoning power was lodged in a court of pardons,
consisting of several great judges. Under the old regime, this important
power was vested in a single official, and he usually took care to have
a general jail delivery in time for the next election.</p>
<p>I inquired about public schools. There were plenty of them, and of
free colleges too. I inquired about compulsory education. This was
received with a smile, and the remark:</p>
<p>“When a man’s child is able to make himself powerful and honoured
according to the amount of education he acquires, don’t you suppose that
that parent will apply the compulsion himself? Our free schools and free
colleges require no law to fill them.“</p>
<p>There was a loving pride of country about this person’s way of
speaking which annoyed me. I had long been unused to the sound of it in
my own. The Gondour national airs were forever dinning in my ears;
therefore I was glad to leave that country and come back to my dear
native land, where one never hears that sort of music.</p>
<p>A MEMORY,</p>
<p>When I say that I never knew my austere father to be enamoured of but
one poem in all the long half century that he lived, persons who knew
him will easily believe me; when I say that I have never composed but
one poem in all the long third of a century that I have lived, persons
who know me will be sincerely grateful; and finally, when I say that the
poem which I composed was not the one which my father was enamoured of,
persons who may have known us both will not need to have this truth shot
into them with a mountain howitzer before they can receive it. My father
and I were always on the most distant terms when I was a boy–a sort of
armed neutrality so to speak. At irregular intervals this neutrality was
broken, and suffering ensued; but I will be candid enough to say that
the breaking and the suffering were always divided up with strict
impartiality between us–which is to say, my father did the breaking, and
I did the suffering. As a general thing I was a backward, cautious,
unadventurous boy; but I once jumped off a two-story table; another time
I gave an elephant a “plug“ of tobacco and retired without waiting for
an answer; and still another time I pretended to be talking in my sleep,
and got off a portion of a very wretched original conundrum in the
hearing of my father. Let us not pry into the result; it was of no
consequence to any one but me.</p>
<p>But the poem I have referred to as attracting my father’s attention
and achieving his favour was “Hiawatha.“ Some man who courted a sudden
and awful death presented him an early copy, and I never lost faith in
my own senses until I saw him sit down and go to reading it in cold
blood–saw him open the book, and heard him read these following lines,
with the same inflectionless judicial frigidity with which he always
read his charge to the jury, or administered an oath to a witness:</p>
<p>“Take your bow, O Hiawatha, Take your arrows, jasper-headed, Take
your war-club, Puggawaugun, And your mittens, Minjekahwan, And your
birch canoe for sailing, And the oil of Mishe-Nama.“</p>
<p>Presently my father took out of his breast pocket an imposing
“Warranty Deed,“ and fixed his eyes upon it and dropped into meditation.
I knew what it was. A Texan lady and gentleman had given my
half-brother, Orrin Johnson, a handsome property in a town in the North,
in gratitude to him for having saved their lives by an act of brilliant
heroism.</p>
<p>By and by my father looked towards me and sighed. Then he said:</p>
<p>“If I had such a son as this poet, here were a subject worthier than
the traditions of these Indians.“</p>
<p>“If you please, sir, where?“</p>
<p>“In this deed.“</p>
<p>“Yes–in this very deed,“ said my father, throwing it on the table.
“There is more poetry, more romance, more sublimity, more splendid
imagery hidden away in that homely document than could be found in all
the traditions of all the savages that live.“</p>
<p>“Indeed, sir? Could I–could I get it out, sir? Could I compose the
poem, sir, do you think?“</p>
<p>“You?“</p>
<p>I wilted.</p>
<p>Presently my father’s face softened somewhat, and he said:</p>
<p>“Go and try. But mind, curb folly. No poetry at the expense of truth.
Keep strictly to the facts.“</p>
<p>I said I would, and bowed myself out, and went upstairs.</p>
<p>“Hiawatha“ kept droning in my head–and so did my father’s remarks
about the sublimity and romance hidden in my subject, and also his
injunction to beware of wasteful and exuberant fancy. I noticed, just
here, that I had heedlessly brought the deed away with me; now at this
moment came to me one of those rare moods of daring recklessness, such
as I referred to a while ago. Without another thought, and in plain
defiance of the fact that I knew my father meant me to write the
romantic story of my half-brother’s adventure and subsequent good
fortune, I ventured to heed merely the letter of his remarks and ignore
their spirit. I took the stupid “Warranty Deed“ itself and chopped it up
into Hiawathian blank verse without altering or leaving out three words,
and without transposing six. It required loads of courage to go
downstairs and face my father with my performance. I started three or
four times before I finally got my pluck to where it would stick. But at
last I said I would go down and read it to him if he threw me over the
church for it. I stood up to begin, and he told me to come closer. I
edged up a little, but still left as much neutral ground between us as I
thought he would stand. Then I began. It would be useless for me to try
to tell what conflicting emotions expressed themselves upon his face,
nor how they grew more and more intense, as I proceeded; nor how a fell
darkness descended upon his countenance, and he began to gag and
swallow, and his hands began to work and twitch, as I reeled off line
after line, with the strength ebbing out of me, and my legs trembling
under me:</p>
<p>THE STORY OF A GALLANT DEED</p>
<p>THIS INDENTURE, made the tenth Day of November, in the year Of our
Lord one thousand eight Hundred six-and-fifty,</p>

<p>West-and-by-north, north-west-by-west, About–</p>
<p>I kind of dodged, and the boot-jack broke the looking-glass. I could
have waited to see what became of the other missiles if I had wanted to,
but I took no interest in such things.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTORY TO “MEMORANDA“</p>
<p>In taking upon myself the burden of editing a department in THE
GALAXY magazine, I have been actuated by a conviction that I was needed,
almost imperatively, in this particular field of literature. I have long
felt that while the magazine literature of the day had much to recommend
it, it yet lacked stability, solidity, weight. It seemed plain to me
that too much space was given to poetry and romance, and not enough to
statistics and agriculture. This defect it shall be my earnest endeavour
to remedy. If I succeed, the simple consciousness that I have done a
good deed will be a sufficient reward.**–[**Together with salary.]</p>
<p>In this department of mine the public may always rely upon finding
exhaustive statistical tables concerning the finances of the country,
the ratio of births and deaths; the percentage of increase of
population, etc., etc.–in a word, everything in the realm of statistics
that can make existence bright and beautiful.</p>
<p>Also, in my department will always be found elaborate condensations
of the Patent Office Reports, wherein a faithful endeavour will at all
times be made to strip the nutritious facts bare of that effulgence of
imagination and sublimity of diction which too often mar the excellence
of those great works.**–[** N. B.–No other magazine in the country makes
a specialty of the Patent Office Reports.]</p>
<p>In my department will always be found ample excerpts from those able
dissertations upon Political Economy which I have for a long time been
contributing to a great metropolitan journal, and which, for reasons
utterly incomprehensible to me, another party has chosen to usurp the
credit of composing.</p>
<p>And, finally, I call attention with pride to the fact that in my
department of the magazine the farmer will always find full market
reports, and also complete instructions about farming, even from the
grafting of the seed to the harrowing of the matured crop. I shall throw
a pathos into the subject of Agriculture that will surprise and delight
the world.</p>
<p>Such is my programme; and I am persuaded that by adhering to it with
fidelity I shall succeed in materially changing the character of this
magazine. Therefore I am emboldened to ask the assistance and
encouragement of all whose sympathies are with Progress and Reform.</p>
<p>In the other departments of the magazine will be found poetry, tales,
and other frothy trifles, and to these the reader can turn for
relaxation from time to time, and thus guard against overstraining the
powers of his mind. M. T.</p>
<p>P. S.–1. I have not sold out of the “Buffalo Express,“ and shall not;
neither shall I stop writing for it. This remark seems necessary in a
business point of view.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>These MEMORANDA are not a “humorous“ department. I would not
conduct an exclusively and professedly humorous department for any one.
I would always prefer to have the privilege of printing a serious and
sensible remark, in case one occurred to me, without the reader’s
feeling obliged to consider himself outraged. We cannot keep the same
mood day after day. I am liable, some day, to want to print my opinion
on jurisprudence, or Homeric poetry, or international law, and I shall
do it. It will be of small consequence to me whether the reader survive
or not. I shall never go straining after jokes when in a cheerless mood,
so long as the unhackneyed subject of international law is open to me. I
will leave all that straining to people who edit professedly and
inexorably “humorous“ departments and publications.</p></li>
<li><p>I have chosen the general title of MEMORANDA for this department
because it is plain and simple, and makes no fraudulent promises. I can
print under it statistics, hotel arrivals, or anything that comes handy,
without violating faith with the reader.</p></li>
<li><p>Puns cannot be allowed a place in this department. Inoffensive
ignorance, benignant stupidity, and unostentatious imbecility will
always be welcomed and cheerfully accorded a corner, and even the
feeblest humour will be admitted, when we can do no better; but no
circumstances, however dismal, will ever be considered a sufficient
excuse for the admission of that last–and saddest evidence of
intellectual poverty, the Pun.</p></li>
