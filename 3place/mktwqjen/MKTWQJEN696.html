<h4 id="chapter-xi.">CHAPTER XI.</h4>
<p>We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that
is in it–and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot
stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again–and that is
well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one any more.
–Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>All English-speaking colonies are made up of lavishly hospitable
people, and New South Wales and its capital are like the rest in this.
The English-speaking colony of the United States of America is always
called lavishly hospitable by the English traveler. As to the other
English-speaking colonies throughout the world from Canada all around, I
know by experience that the description fits them. I will not go more
particularly into this matter, for I find that when writers try to
distribute their gratitude here and there and yonder by detail they run
across difficulties and do some ungraceful stumbling.</p>
<p>Mr. Gane (“New South Wales and Victoria in 1885 “), tried to
distribute his gratitude, and was not lucky:</p>
<p>“The inhabitants of Sydney are renowned for their hospitality. The
treatment which we experienced at the hands of this generous-hearted
people will help more than anything else to make us recollect with
pleasure our stay amongst them. In the character of hosts and hostesses
they excel. The ‘new chum’ needs only the acquaintanceship of one of
their number, and he becomes at once the happy recipient of numerous
complimentary invitations and thoughtful kindnesses. Of the towns it has
been our good fortune to visit, none have portrayed home so faithfully
as Sydney.“</p>
<p>Nobody could say it finer than that. If he had put in his cork then,
and stayed away from Dubbo—-but no; heedless man, he pulled it again.
Pulled it when he was away along in his book, and his memory of what he
had said about Sydney had grown dim:</p>
<p>“We cannot quit the promising town of Dubbo without testifying, in
warm praise, to the kind-hearted and hospitable usages of its
inhabitants. Sydney, though well deserving the character it bears of its
kindly treatment of strangers, possesses a little formality and reserve.
In Dubbo, on the contrary, though the same congenial manners prevail,
there is a pleasing degree of respectful familiarity which gives the
town a homely comfort not often met with elsewhere. In laying on one
side our pen we feel contented in having been able, though so late in
this work, to bestow a panegyric, however unpretentious, on a town
which, though possessing no picturesque natural surroundings, nor
interesting architectural productions, has yet a body of citizens whose
hearts cannot but obtain for their town a reputation for benevolence and
kind-heartedness.“</p>
<p>I wonder what soured him on Sydney. It seems strange that a pleasing
degree of three or four fingers of respectful familiarity should fill a
man up and give him the panegyrics so bad. For he has them, the worst
way–any one can see that. A man who is perfectly at himself does not
throw cold detraction at people’s architectural productions and
picturesque surroundings, and let on that what he prefers is a Dubbonese
dust-storm and a pleasing degree of respectful familiarity, No, these
are old, old symptoms; and when they appear we know that the man has got
the panegyrics.</p>
<p>Sydney has a population of 400,000. When a stranger from America
steps ashore there, the first thing that strikes him is that the place
is eight or nine times as large as he was expecting it to be; and the
next thing that strikes him is that it is an English city with American
trimmings. Later on, in Melbourne, he will find the American trimmings
still more in evidence; there, even the architecture will often suggest
America; a photograph of its stateliest business street might be passed
upon him for a picture of the finest street in a large American city. I
was told that the most of the fine residences were the city residences
of squatters. The name seemed out of focus somehow. When the explanation
came, it offered a new instance of the curious changes which words, as
well as animals, undergo through change of habitat and climate. With us,
when you speak of a squatter you are always supposed to be speaking of a
poor man, but in Australia when you speak of a squatter you are supposed
to be speaking of a millionaire; in America the word indicates the
possessor of a few acres and a doubtful title, in Australia it indicates
a man whose landfront is as long as a railroad, and whose title has been
perfected in one way or another; in America the word indicates a man who
owns a dozen head of live stock, in Australia a man who owns anywhere
from fifty thousand up to half a million head; in America the word
indicates a man who is obscure and not important, in Australia a man who
is prominent and of the first importance; in America you take off your
hat to no squatter, in Australia you do; in America if your uncle is a
squatter you keep it dark, in Australia you advertise it; in America if
your friend is a squatter nothing comes of it, but with a squatter for
your friend in Australia you may sup with kings if there are any
around.</p>
<p>In Australia it takes about two acres and a half of pastureland (some
people say twice as many), to support a sheep; and when the squatter has
half a million sheep his private domain is about as large as Rhode
Island, to speak in general terms. His annual wool crop may be worth a
quarter or a half million dollars.</p>
<p>He will live in a palace in Melbourne or Sydney or some other of the
large cities, and make occasional trips to his sheep-kingdom several
hundred miles away in the great plains to look after his battalions of
riders and shepherds and other hands. He has a commodious dwelling out
there, and if he approve of you he will invite you to spend a week in
it, and will make you at home and comfortable, and let you see the great
industry in all its details, and feed you and slake you and smoke you
with the best that money can buy.</p>
<p>On at least one of these vast estates there is a considerable town,
with all the various businesses and occupations that go to make an
important town; and the town and the land it stands upon are the
property of the squatters. I have seen that town, and it is not unlikely
that there are other squatter-owned towns in Australia.</p>
<p>Australia supplies the world not only with fine wool, but with mutton
also. The modern invention of cold storage and its application in ships
has created this great trade. In Sydney I visited a huge establishment
where they kill and clean and solidly freeze a thousand sheep a day, for
shipment to England.</p>
<p>The Australians did not seem to me to differ noticeably from
Americans, either in dress, carriage, ways, pronunciation, inflections,
or general appearance. There were fleeting and subtle suggestions of
their English origin, but these were not pronounced enough, as a rule,
to catch one’s attention. The people have easy and cordial manners from
the beginning –from the moment that the introduction is completed. This
is American. To put it in another way, it is English friendliness with
the English shyness and self-consciousness left out.</p>
<p>Now and then–but this is rare–one hears such words as piper for
paper, lydy for lady, and tyble for table fall from lips whence one
would not expect such pronunciations to come. There is a superstition
prevalent in Sydney that this pronunciation is an Australianism, but
people who have been “home“–as the native reverently and lovingly calls
England–know better. It is “costermonger.“ All over Australasia this
pronunciation is nearly as common among servants as it is in London
among the uneducated and the partially educated of all sorts and
conditions of people. That mislaid ‘y’ is rather striking when a person
gets enough of it into a short sentence to enable it to show up. In the
hotel in Sydney the chambermaid said, one morning:</p>
<p>“The tyble is set, and here is the piper; and if the lydy is ready
I’ll tell the wyter to bring up the breakfast.“</p>
<p>I have made passing mention, a moment ago, of the native
Australasian’s custom of speaking of England as “home.“ It was always
pretty to hear it, and often it was said in an unconsciously caressing
way that made it touching; in a way which transmuted a sentiment into an
embodiment, and made one seem to see Australasia as a young girl
stroking mother England’s old gray head.</p>
<p>In the Australasian home the table-talk is vivacious and
unembarrassed; it is without stiffness or restraint. This does not
remind one of England so much as it does of America. But Australasia is
strictly democratic, and reserves and restraints are things that are
bred by differences of rank.</p>
<p>English and colonial audiences are phenomenally alert and responsive.
Where masses of people are gathered together in England, caste is
submerged, and with it the English reserve; equality exists for the
moment, and every individual is free; so free from any consciousness of
fetters, indeed, that the Englishman’s habit of watching himself and
guarding himself against any injudicious exposure of his feelings is
forgotten, and falls into abeyance–and to such a degree indeed, that he
will bravely applaud all by himself if he wants to–an exhibition of
daring which is unusual elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>But it is hard to move a new English acquaintance when he is by
himself, or when the company present is small and new to him. He is on
his guard then, and his natural reserve is to the fore. This has given
him the false reputation of being without humor and without the
appreciation of humor.</p>
<p>Americans are not Englishmen, and American humor is not English
humor; but both the American and his humor had their origin in England,
and have merely undergone changes brought about by changed conditions
and a new environment. About the best humorous speeches I have yet heard
were a couple that were made in Australia at club suppers–one of them by
an Englishman, the other by an Australian.</p>
