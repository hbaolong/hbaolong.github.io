XLV A Catastrophe Which Cost Eleven Lives [Perished at the Verge of
Safety]</h4>
<p>On the 5th of September, 1870, a caravan of eleven persons departed
from Chamonix to make the ascent of Mont Blanc. Three of the party were
tourists; Messrs. Randall and Bean, Americans, and Mr. George
Corkindale, a Scotch gentleman; there were three guides and five
porters. The cabin on the Grands Mulets was reached that day; the ascent
was resumed early the next morning, September 6th. The day was fine and
clear, and the movements of the party were observed through the
telescopes of Chamonix; at two o’clock in the afternoon they were seen
to reach the summit. A few minutes later they were seen making the first
steps of the descent; then a cloud closed around them and hid them from
view.</p>
<p>Eight hours passed, the cloud still remained, night came, no one had
returned to the Grands Mulets. Sylvain Couttet, keeper of the cabin
there, suspected a misfortune, and sent down to the valley for help. A
detachment of guides went up, but by the time they had made the tedious
trip and reached the cabin, a raging storm had set in. They had to wait;
nothing could be attempted in such a tempest.</p>
<p>The wild storm lasted MORE THAN A WEEK, without ceasing; but on the
17th, Couttet, with several guides, left the cabin and succeeded in
making the ascent. In the snowy wastes near the summit they came upon
five bodies, lying upon their sides in a reposeful attitude which
suggested that possibly they had fallen asleep there, while exhausted
with fatigue and hunger and benumbed with cold, and never knew when
death stole upon them. Couttet moved a few steps further and discovered
five more bodies. The eleventh corpse–that of a porter–was not found,
although diligent search was made for it.</p>
<p>In the pocket of Mr. Bean, one of the Americans, was found a
note-book in which had been penciled some sentences which admit us, in
flesh and spirit, as it were, to the presence of these men during their
last hours of life, and to the grisly horrors which their fading vision
looked upon and their failing consciousness took cognizance of:</p>
<p>TUESDAY, SEPT. 6. I have made the ascent of Mont Blanc, with ten
persons–eight guides, and Mr. Corkindale and Mr. Randall. We reached the
summit at half past 2. Immediately after quitting it, we were enveloped
in clouds of snow. We passed the night in a grotto hollowed in the snow,
which afforded us but poor shelter, and I was ill all night.</p>
<p>SEPT. 7–MORNING. The cold is excessive. The snow falls heavily and
without interruption. The guides take no rest.</p>
<p>EVENING. My Dear Hessie, we have been two days on Mont Blanc, in the
midst of a terrible hurricane of snow, we have lost our way, and are in
a hole scooped in the snow, at an altitude of 15,000 feet. I have no
longer any hope of descending.</p>
<p>They had wandered around, and around, in the blinding snow-storm,
hopelessly lost, in a space only a hundred yards square; and when cold
and fatigue vanquished them at last, they scooped their cave and lay
down there to die by inches, UNAWARE THAT FIVE STEPS MORE WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT THEM INTO THE TRUTH PATH. They were so near to life and safety
as that, and did not suspect it. The thought of this gives the sharpest
pang that the tragic story conveys.</p>
<p>The author of the HISTOIRE DU MONT BLANC introduced the closing
sentences of Mr. Bean’s pathetic record thus:</p>
<p>“Here the characters are large and unsteady; the hand which traces
them is become chilled and torpid; but the spirit survives, and the
faith and resignation of the dying man are expressed with a sublime
simplicity.“</p>
<p>Perhaps this note-book will be found and sent to you. We have nothing
to eat, my feet are already frozen, and I am exhausted; I have strength
to write only a few words more. I have left means for C’s education; I
know you will employ them wisely. I die with faith in God, and with
loving thoughts of you. Farewell to all. We shall meet again, in Heaven.
… I think of you always.</p>
<p>It is the way of the Alps to deliver death to their victims with a
merciful swiftness, but here the rule failed. These men suffered the
bitterest death that has been recorded in the history of those
mountains, freighted as that history is with grisly tragedies.</p>
