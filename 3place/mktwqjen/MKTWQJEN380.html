<h4 id="chapter-xxx.-toms-progress.">Chapter XXX. Tom’s progress.</h4>
<p>Whilst the true King wandered about the land poorly clad, poorly fed,
cuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves and
murderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by all
impartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed quite a different
experience.</p>
<p>When we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a bright
side for him. This bright side went on brightening more and more every
day: in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and
delightfulness. He lost his fears; his misgivings faded out and died;
his embarrassments departed, and gave place to an easy and confident
bearing. He worked the whipping-boy mine to ever-increasing profit.</p>
<p>He ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Grey into his presence
when he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with
them, with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances. It
no longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand at
parting.</p>
<p>He came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and
dressed with intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning. It came to be
a proud pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession
of officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms; insomuch, indeed, that he
doubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred. He
liked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors, and the
distant voices responding, “Way for the King!“</p>
<p>He even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and
seeming to be something more than the Lord Protector’s mouthpiece. He
liked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, and listen
to the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who
called him brother. O happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!</p>
<p>He enjoyed his splendid clothes, and ordered more: he found his four
hundred servants too few for his proper grandeur, and trebled them. The
adulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet music to his ears. He
remained kind and gentle, and a sturdy and determined champion of all
that were oppressed, and he made tireless war upon unjust laws: yet upon
occasion, being offended, he could turn upon an earl, or even a duke,
and give him a look that would make him tremble. Once, when his royal
‘sister,’ the grimly holy Lady Mary, set herself to reason with him
against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people who would
otherwise be jailed, or hanged, or burned, and reminded him that their
august late father’s prisons had sometimes contained as high as sixty
thousand convicts at one time, and that during his admirable reign he
had delivered seventy-two thousand thieves and robbers over to death by
the executioner, {9} the boy was filled with generous indignation, and
commanded her to go to her closet, and beseech God to take away the
stone that was in her breast, and give her a human heart.</p>
<p>Did Tom Canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful
prince who had treated him so kindly, and flown out with such hot zeal
to avenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate? Yes; his
first royal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful
thoughts about the lost prince, and with sincere longings for his
return, and happy restoration to his native rights and splendours. But
as time wore on, and the prince did not come, Tom’s mind became more and
more occupied with his new and enchanting experiences, and by little and
little the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and
finally, when he did intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an
unwelcome spectre, for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed.</p>
<p>Tom’s poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his
mind. At first he pined for them, sorrowed for them, longed to see them,
but later, the thought of their coming some day in their rags and dirt,
and betraying him with their kisses, and pulling him down from his lofty
place, and dragging him back to penury and degradation and the slums,
made him shudder. At last they ceased to trouble his thoughts almost
wholly. And he was content, even glad: for, whenever their mournful and
accusing faces did rise before him now, they made him feel more
despicable than the worms that crawl.</p>
<p>At midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty was sinking to sleep
in his rich bed in the palace, guarded by his loyal vassals, and
surrounded by the pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for tomorrow was the
day appointed for his solemn crowning as King of England. At that same
hour, Edward, the true king, hungry and thirsty, soiled and draggled,
worn with travel, and clothed in rags and shreds–his share of the
results of the riot–was wedged in among a crowd of people who were
watching with deep interest certain hurrying gangs of workmen who
streamed in and out of Westminster Abbey, busy as ants: they were making
the last preparation for the royal coronation.</p>
