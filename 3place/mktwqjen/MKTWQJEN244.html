<h4 id="about-smells">ABOUT SMELLS</h4>
<p>In a recent issue of the “Independent,“ the Rev. T. De Witt Talmage,
of Brooklyn, has the following utterance on the subject of “Smells“:</p>
<p>I have a good Christian friend who, if he sat in the front pew in
church, and a working man should enter the door at the other end, would
smell him instantly. My friend is not to blame for the sensitiveness of
his nose, any more than you would flog a pointer for being keener on the
scent than a stupid watch dog. The fact is, if you, had all the churches
free, by reason of the mixing up of the common people with the uncommon,
you would keep one-half of Christendom sick at their stomach. If you are
going to kill the church thus with bad smells, I will have nothing to do
with this work of evangelization.</p>
<p>We have reason to believe that there will be labouring men in heaven;
and also a number of negroes, and Esquimaux, and Terra del Fuegans, and
Arabs, and a few Indians, and possibly even some Spaniards and
Portuguese. All things are possible with God. We shall have all these
sorts of people in heaven; but, alas! in getting them we shall lose the
society of Dr. Talmage. Which is to say, we shall lose the company of
one who could give more real “tone“ to celestial society than any other
contribution Brooklyn could furnish. And what would eternal happiness be
without the Doctor? Blissful, unquestionably–we know that well enough
but would it be ‘distingue,’ would it be ‘recherche’ without him?
St. Matthew without stockings or sandals; St. Jerome bare headed, and
with a coarse brown blanket robe dragging the ground; St. Sebastian with
scarcely any raiment at all–these we should see, and should enjoy seeing
them; but would we not miss a spike-tailed coat and kids, and turn away
regretfully, and say to parties from the Orient: “These are well enough,
but you ought to see Talmage of Brooklyn.“ I fear me that in the better
world we shall not even have Dr. Talmage’s “good Christian friend.“</p>
<p>For if he were sitting under the glory of the Throne, and the keeper
of the keys admitted a Benjamin Franklin or other labouring man, that
“friend,“ with his fine natural powers infinitely augmented by
emancipation from hampering flesh, would detect him with a single sniff,
and immediately take his hat and ask to be excused.</p>
<p>To all outward seeming, the Rev. T. De Witt Talmage is of the same
material as that used in the construction of his early predecessors in
the ministry; and yet one feels that there must be a difference
somewhere between him and the Saviour’s first disciples. It may be
because here, in the nineteenth century, Dr. T. has had advantages which
Paul and Peter and the others could not and did not have. There was a
lack of polish about them, and a looseness of etiquette, and a want of
exclusiveness, which one cannot help noticing. They healed the very
beggars, and held intercourse with people of a villainous odour every
day. If the subject of these remarks had been chosen among the original
Twelve Apostles, he would not have associated with the rest, because he
could not have stood the fishy smell of some of his comrades who came
from around the Sea of Galilee. He would have resigned his commission
with some such remark as he makes in the extract quoted above: “Master,
if thou art going to kill the church thus with bad smells, I will have
nothing to do with this work of evangelization.“ He is a disciple, and
makes that remark to the Master; the only difference is, that he makes
it in the nineteenth instead of the first century.</p>
<p>Is there a choir in Mr. T.’s church? And does it ever occur that they
have no better manners than to sing that hymn which is so suggestive of
labourers and mechanics:</p>
<p>“Son of the Carpenter! receive This humble work of mine?“</p>
<p>Now, can it be possible that in a handful of centuries the Christian
character has fallen away from an imposing heroism that scorned even the
stake, the cross, and the axe, to a poor little effeminacy that withers
and wilts under an unsavoury smell? We are not prepared to believe so,
the reverend Doctor and his friend to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
