<h4 id="letter-v">LETTER V</h4>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, 18–. DEAR CHING-FOO: You will remember that I had just
been thrust violently into a cell in the city prison when I wrote last.
I stumbled and fell on some one. I got a blow and a curse= and on top of
these a kick or two and a shove. In a second or two it was plain that I
was in a nest of prisoners and was being “passed around“–for the instant
I was knocked out of the way of one I fell on the head or heels of
another and was promptly ejected, only to land on a third prisoner and
get a new contribution of kicks and curses and a new destination. I
brought up at last in an unoccupied corner, very much battered and
bruised and sore, but glad enough to be let alone for a little while. I
was on the flag-stones, for there was, no furniture in the den except a
long, broad board, or combination of boards, like a barn-door, and this
bed was accommodating five or six persons, and that was its full
capacity. They lay stretched side by side, snoring–when not fighting.
One end of the board was four, inches higher than the other, and so the
slant answered for a pillow. There were no blankets, and the night was a
little chilly; the nights are always a little chilly in San Francisco,
though never severely cold. The board was a deal more comfortable than
the stones, and occasionally some flag-stone plebeian like me would try
to creep to a place on it; and then the aristocrats would hammer him
good and make him think a flag pavement was a nice enough place after
all.</p>
<p>I lay quiet in my corner, stroking my bruises, and listening to the
revelations the prisoners made to each other–and to me for some that
were near me talked to me a good deal. I had long had an idea that
Americans, being free, had no need of prisons, which are a contrivance
of despots for keeping restless patriots out of mischief. So I was
considerably surprised to find out my mistake.</p>
<p>Ours was a big general cell, it seemed, for the temporary
accommodation of all comers whose crimes were trifling. Among us they
were two Americans, two “Greasers“ (Mexicans), a Frenchman, a German,
four Irishmen, a Chilenean (and, in the next cell, only separated from
us by a grating, two women), all drunk, and all more or less noisy; and
as night fell and advanced, they grew more and more discontented and
disorderly, occasionally; shaking the prison bars and glaring through
them at the slowly pacing officer, and cursing him with all their
hearts. The two women were nearly middle-aged, and they had only had
enough liquor to stimulate instead of stupefy them. Consequently they
would fondle and kiss each other for some minutes, and then fall to
fighting and keep it up till they were just two grotesque tangles of
rags and blood and tumbled hair. Then they would rest awhile and pant
and swear. While they were affectionate they always spoke of each other
as “ladies,“ but while they were fighting “strumpet“ was the mildest
name they could think of–and they could only make that do by tacking
some sounding profanity to it. In their last fight, which was toward
midnight, one of them bit off the other’s finger, and then the officer
interfered and put the “Greaser“ into the “dark cell“ to answer for it
because the woman that did it laid it on him, and the other woman did
not deny it because, as she said afterward, she “wanted another crack at
the huzzy when her finger quit hurting,“ and so she did not want her
removed. By this time those two women had mutilated each other’s clothes
to that extent that there was not sufficient left to cover their
nakedness. I found that one of these creatures had spent nine years in
the county jail, and that the other one had spent about four or five
years in the same place. They had done it from choice. As soon as they
were discharged from captivity they would go straight and get drunk, and
then steal some trifling thing while an officer was observing them. That
would entitle them to another two, months in jail, and there they would
occupy clean, airy apartments, and have good food in plenty, and being
at no expense at all, they, could make shirts for the clothiers at half
a dollar apiece and thus keep themselves in smoking tobacco and such
other luxuries as they wanted. When the two months were up they would go
just as straight as they could walk to Mother Leonard’s and get drunk;
and from there to Kearney street and steal something; and thence to this
city prison, and next day back to the old quarters in the county jail
again. One of them had really kept this up for nine years and the other
four or five, and both said they meant to end their days in that prison.
–[The former of the two did.–Ed. Men.]–Finally, both these creatures
fell upon me while I was dozing with my head against their grating, and
battered me considerably, because they discovered that I was a Chinaman,
and they said I was “a bloody interlopin’ loafer come from the devil’s
own country to take the bread out of dacent people’s mouths and put down
the wages for work whin it was all a Christian could do to kape body and
sowl together as it was.“ “Loafer“ means one who will not work. AH SONG
