<h4 id="chapter-xix.">CHAPTER XIX.</h4>
<p>On the morning of the sixteenth day out from St. Joseph we arrived at
the entrance of Rocky Canyon, two hundred and fifty miles from Salt
Lake. It was along in this wild country somewhere, and far from any
habitation of white men, except the stage stations, that we came across
the wretchedest type of mankind I have ever seen, up to this writing. I
refer to the Goshoot Indians. From what we could see and all we could
learn, they are very considerably inferior to even the despised Digger
Indians of California; inferior to all races of savages on our
continent; inferior to even the Terra del Fuegans; inferior to the
Hottentots, and actually inferior in some respects to the Kytches of
Africa. Indeed, I have been obliged to look the bulky volumes of Wood’s
“Uncivilized Races of Men“ clear through in order to find a savage tribe
degraded enough to take rank with the Goshoots. I find but one people
fairly open to that shameful verdict. It is the Bosjesmans (Bushmen) of
South Africa. Such of the Goshoots as we saw, along the road and hanging
about the stations, were small, lean, “scrawny“ creatures; in complexion
a dull black like the ordinary American negro; their faces and hands
bearing dirt which they had been hoarding and accumulating for months,
years, and even generations, according to the age of the proprietor; a
silent, sneaking, treacherous looking race; taking note of everything,
covertly, like all the other “Noble Red Men“ that we (do not) read
about, and betraying no sign in their countenances; indolent,
everlastingly patient and tireless, like all other Indians; prideless
beggars–for if the beggar instinct were left out of an Indian he would
not “go,“ any more than a clock without a pendulum; hungry, always
hungry, and yet never refusing anything that a hog would eat, though
often eating what a hog would decline; hunters, but having no higher
ambition than to kill and eat jack-ass rabbits, crickets and
grasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from the buzzards and cayotes;
savages who, when asked if they have the common Indian belief in a Great
Spirit show a something which almost amounts to emotion, thinking
whiskey is referred to; a thin, scattering race of almost naked black
children, these Goshoots are, who produce nothing at all, and have no
villages, and no gatherings together into strictly defined tribal
communities–a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on a bush to keep
off a portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of the most rocky,
wintry, repulsive wastes that our country or any other can exhibit.</p>
<p>The Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended from the
self-same gorilla, or kangaroo, or Norway rat, which-ever animal–Adam
the Darwinians trace them to.</p>
<p>One would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the Goshoots, and
yet they used to live off the offal and refuse of the stations a few
months and then come some dark night when no mischief was expected, and
burn down the buildings and kill the men from ambush as they rushed out.
And once, in the night, they attacked the stage-coach when a District
Judge, of Nevada Territory, was the only passenger, and with their first
volley of arrows (and a bullet or two) they riddled the stage curtains,
wounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the driver. The latter was
full of pluck, and so was his passenger. At the driver’s call Judge Mott
swung himself out, clambered to the box and seized the reins of the
team, and away they plunged, through the racing mob of skeletons and
under a hurtling storm of missiles. The stricken driver had sunk down on
the boot as soon as he was wounded, but had held on to the reins and
said he would manage to keep hold of them until relieved.</p>
<p>And after they were taken from his relaxing grasp, he lay with his
head between Judge Mott’s feet, and tranquilly gave directions about the
road; he said he believed he could live till the miscreants were outrun
and left behind, and that if he managed that, the main difficulty would
be at an end, and then if the Judge drove so and so (giving directions
about bad places in the road, and general course) he would reach the
next station without trouble. The Judge distanced the enemy and at last
rattled up to the station and knew that the night’s perils were done;
but there was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice with, for the
soldierly driver was dead.</p>
<p>Let us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the
Overland drivers, now. The disgust which the Goshoots gave me, a
disciple of Cooper and a worshipper of the Red Man–even of the scholarly
savages in the “Last of the Mohicans“ who are fittingly associated with
backwoodsmen who divide each sentence into two equal parts: one part
critically grammatical, refined and choice of language, and the other
part just such an attempt to talk like a hunter or a mountaineer, as a
Broadway clerk might make after eating an edition of Emerson Bennett’s
works and studying frontier life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of
weeks–I say that the nausea which the Goshoots gave me, an Indian
worshipper, set me to examining authorities, to see if perchance I had
been over-estimating the Red Man while viewing him through the mellow
moonshine of romance. The revelations that came were disenchanting. It
was curious to see how quickly the paint and tinsel fell away from him
and left him treacherous, filthy and repulsive–and how quickly the
evidences accumulated that wherever one finds an Indian tribe he has
only found Goshoots more or less modified by circumstances and
surroundings–but Goshoots, after all. They deserve pity, poor creatures;
and they can have mine–at this distance. Nearer by, they never get
anybody’s.</p>
<p>There is an impression abroad that the Baltimore and Washington
Railroad Company and many of its employees are Goshoots; but it is an
error. There is only a plausible resemblance, which, while it is apt
enough to mislead the ignorant, cannot deceive parties who have
contemplated both tribes. But seriously, it was not only poor wit, but
very wrong to start the report referred to above; for however innocent
the motive may have been, the necessary effect was to injure the
reputation of a class who have a hard enough time of it in the pitiless
deserts of the Rocky Mountains, Heaven knows! If we cannot find it in
our hearts to give those poor naked creatures our Christian sympathy and
compassion, in God’s name let us at least not throw mud at them.</p>
