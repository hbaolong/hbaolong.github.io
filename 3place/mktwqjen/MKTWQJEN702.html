<h4 id="chapter-xvii.">CHAPTER XVII.</h4>
<p>The English are mentioned in the Bible: Blessed are the meek, for
they shall inherit the earth. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>When we consider the immensity of the British Empire in territory,
population, and trade, it requires a stern exercise of faith to believe
in the figures which represent Australasia’s contribution to the
Empire’s commercial grandeur. As compared with the landed estate of the
British Empire, the landed estate dominated by any other Power except
one –Russia–is not very impressive for size. My authorities make the
British Empire not much short of a fourth larger than the Russian
Empire. Roughly proportioned, if you will allow your entire hand to
represent the British Empire, you may then cut off the fingers a trifle
above the middle joint of the middle finger, and what is left of the
hand will represent Russia. The populations ruled by Great Britain and
China are about the same–400,000,000 each. No other Power approaches
these figures. Even Russia is left far behind.</p>
<p>The population of Australasia–4,000,000–sinks into nothingness, and
is lost from sight in that British ocean of 400,000,000. Yet the
statistics indicate that it rises again and shows up very conspicuously
when its share of the Empire’s commerce is the matter under
consideration. The value of England’s annual exports and imports is
stated at three billions of dollars,–[New South Wales Blue Book.]–and it
is claimed that more than one-tenth of this great aggregate is
represented by Australasia’s exports to England and imports from
England. In addition to this, Australasia does a trade with countries
other than England, amounting to a hundred million dollars a year, and a
domestic intercolonial trade amounting to a hundred and fifty
millions.</p>
<p>In round numbers the 4,000,000 buy and sell about 00,000,000 worth of
goods a year. It is claimed that about half of this represents
commodities of Australasian production. The products exported annually
by India are worth a trifle over 00,000,000. Now, here are some
faith-straining figures:</p>
<p>Indian production (300,000,000 population), 00,000,000.</p>
<p>Australasian production (4,000,000 population), 00,000,000.</p>
<p>That is to say, the product of the individual Indian, annually (for
export some whither), is worth .15; that of the individual Australasian
(for export some whither), 5! Or, to put it in another way, the Indian
family of man and wife and three children sends away an annual result
worth .75, while the Australasian family sends away 75 worth.</p>
<p>There are trustworthy statistics furnished by Sir Richard Temple and
others, which show that the individual Indian’s whole annual product,
both for export and home use, is worth in gold only .50; or, 7.50 for
the family-aggregate. Ciphered out on a like ratio of multiplication,
the Australasian family’s aggregate production would be nearly ,600.
Truly, nothing is so astonishing as figures, if they once get
started.</p>
<p>We left Melbourne by rail for Adelaide, the capital of the vast
Province of South Australia–a seventeen-hour excursion. On the train we
found several Sydney friends; among them a Judge who was going out on
circuit, and was going to hold court at Broken Hill, where the
celebrated silver mine is. It seemed a curious road to take to get to
that region. Broken Hill is close to the western border of New South
Wales, and Sydney is on the eastern border. A fairly straight line, 700
miles long, drawn westward from Sydney, would strike Broken Hill, just
as a somewhat shorter one drawn west from Boston would strike Buffalo.
The way the Judge was traveling would carry him over 2,000 miles by
rail, he said; southwest from Sydney down to Melbourne, then northward
up to Adelaide, then a cant back northeastward and over the border into
New South Wales once more–to Broken Hill. It was like going from Boston
southwest to Richmond, Virginia, then northwest up to Erie,
Pennsylvania, then a cant back northeast and over the border–to Buffalo,
New York.</p>
<p>But the explanation was simple. Years ago the fabulously rich silver
discovery at Broken Hill burst suddenly upon an unexpectant world. Its
stocks started at shillings, and went by leaps and bounds to the most
fanciful figures. It was one of those cases where the cook puts a
month’s wages into shares, and comes next mouth and buys your house at
your own price, and moves into it herself; where the coachman takes a
few shares, and next month sets up a bank; and where the common sailor
invests the price of a spree, and next month buys out the steamship
company and goes into business on his own hook. In a word, it was one of
those excitements which bring multitudes of people to a common center
with a rush, and whose needs must be supplied, and at once. Adelaide was
close by, Sydney was far away. Adelaide threw a short railway across the
border before Sydney had time to arrange for a long one; it was not
worth while for Sydney to arrange at all. The whole vast trade-profit of
Broken Hill fell into Adelaide’s hands, irrevocably. New South Wales
furnishes for Broken Hill and sends her Judges 2,000 miles–mainly
through alien countries–to administer it, but Adelaide takes the
dividends and makes no moan.</p>
<p>We started at 4.20 in the afternoon, and moved across level until
night. In the morning we had a stretch of “scrub“ country–the kind of
thing which is so useful to the Australian novelist. In the scrub the
hostile aboriginal lurks, and flits mysteriously about, slipping out
from time to time to surprise and slaughter the settler; then slipping
back again, and leaving no track that the white man can follow. In the
scrub the novelist’s heroine gets lost, search fails of result; she
wanders here and there, and finally sinks down exhausted and
unconscious, and the searchers pass within a yard or two of her, not
suspecting that she is near, and by and by some rambler finds her bones
and the pathetic diary which she had scribbled with her failing hand and
left behind. Nobody can find a lost heroine in the scrub but the
aboriginal “tracker,“ and he will not lend himself to the scheme if it
will interfere with the novelist’s plot. The scrub stretches miles and
miles in all directions, and looks like a level roof of bush-tops
without a break or a crack in it –as seamless as a blanket, to all
appearance. One might as well walk under water and hope to guess out a
route and stick to it, I should think. Yet it is claimed that the
aboriginal “tracker“ was able to hunt out people lost in the scrub. Also
in the “bush“; also in the desert; and even follow them over patches of
bare rocks and over alluvial ground which had to all appearance been
washed clear of footprints.</p>
<p>From reading Australian books and talking with the people, I became
convinced that the aboriginal tracker’s performances evince a craft, a
penetration, a luminous sagacity, and a minuteness and accuracy of
observation in the matter of detective-work not found in nearly so
remarkable a degree in any other people, white or colored. In an
official account of the blacks of Australia published by the government
of Victoria, one reads that the aboriginal not only notices the faint
marks left on the bark of a tree by the claws of a climbing opossum, but
knows in some way or other whether the marks were made to-day or
yesterday.</p>
<p>And there is the case, on records where A., a settler, makes a bet
with B., that B. may lose a cow as effectually as he can, and A. will
produce an aboriginal who will find her. B. selects a cow and lets the
tracker see the cow’s footprint, then be put under guard. B. then drives
the cow a few miles over a course which drifts in all directions, and
frequently doubles back upon itself; and he selects difficult ground all
the time, and once or twice even drives the cow through herds of other
cows, and mingles her tracks in the wide confusion of theirs. He finally
brings his cow home; the aboriginal is set at liberty, and at once moves
around in a great circle, examining all cow-tracks until he finds the
one he is after; then sets off and follows it throughout its erratic
course, and ultimately tracks it to the stable where B. has hidden the
cow. Now wherein does one cow-track differ from another? There must be a
difference, or the tracker could not have performed the feat; a
difference minute, shadowy, and not detectible by you or me, or by the
late Sherlock Holmes, and yet discernible by a member of a race charged
by some people with occupying the bottom place in the gradations of
human intelligence.</p>
