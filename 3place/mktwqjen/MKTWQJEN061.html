<h4 id="chapter-lx.">CHAPTER LX.</h4>
<p>Ten or eleven o’clock found us coming down to breakfast one morning
in Cadiz. They told us the ship had been lying at anchor in the harbor
two or three hours. It was time for us to bestir ourselves. The ship
could wait only a little while because of the quarantine. We were soon
on board, and within the hour the white city and the pleasant shores of
Spain sank down behind the waves and passed out of sight. We had seen no
land fade from view so regretfully.</p>
<p>It had long ago been decided in a noisy public meeting in the main
cabin that we could not go to Lisbon, because we must surely be
quarantined there. We did every thing by mass-meeting, in the good old
national way, from swapping off one empire for another on the programme
of the voyage down to complaining of the cookery and the scarcity of
napkins. I am reminded, now, of one of these complaints of the cookery
made by a passenger. The coffee had been steadily growing more and more
execrable for the space of three weeks, till at last it had ceased to be
coffee altogether and had assumed the nature of mere discolored water–so
this person said. He said it was so weak that it was transparent an inch
in depth around the edge of the cup. As he approached the table one
morning he saw the transparent edge–by means of his extraordinary vision
long before he got to his seat. He went back and complained in a
high-handed way to Capt. Duncan. He said the coffee was disgraceful. The
Captain showed his. It seemed tolerably good. The incipient mutineer was
more outraged than ever, then, at what he denounced as the partiality
shown the captain’s table over the other tables in the ship. He
flourished back and got his cup and set it down triumphantly, and
said:</p>
<p>“Just try that mixture once, Captain Duncan.“</p>
<p>He smelt it–tasted it–smiled benignantly–then said:</p>
<p>“It is inferior–for coffee–but it is pretty fair tea.“</p>
<p>The humbled mutineer smelt it, tasted it, and returned to his seat.
He had made an egregious ass of himself before the whole ship. He did it
no more. After that he took things as they came. That was me.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned ship-life had returned, now that we were no longer
in sight of land. For days and days it continued just the same, one day
being exactly like another, and, to me, every one of them pleasant. At
last we anchored in the open roadstead of Funchal, in the beautiful
islands we call the Madeiras.</p>
<p>The mountains looked surpassingly lovely, clad as they were in
living, green; ribbed with lava ridges; flecked with white cottages;
riven by deep chasms purple with shade; the great slopes dashed with
sunshine and mottled with shadows flung from the drifting squadrons of
the sky, and the superb picture fitly crowned by towering peaks whose
fronts were swept by the trailing fringes of the clouds.</p>
<p>But we could not land. We staid all day and looked, we abused the man
who invented quarantine, we held half a dozen mass-meetings and crammed
them full of interrupted speeches, motions that fell still-born,
amendments that came to nought and resolutions that died from sheer
exhaustion in trying to get before the house. At night we set sail.</p>
<p>We averaged four mass-meetings a week for the voyage–we seemed always
in labor in this way, and yet so often fallaciously that whenever at
long intervals we were safely delivered of a resolution, it was cause
for public rejoicing, and we hoisted the flag and fired a salute.</p>
<p>Days passed–and nights; and then the beautiful Bermudas rose out of
the sea, we entered the tortuous channel, steamed hither and thither
among the bright summer islands, and rested at last under the flag of
England and were welcome. We were not a nightmare here, where were
civilization and intelligence in place of Spanish and Italian
superstition, dirt and dread of cholera. A few days among the breezy
groves, the flower gardens, the coral caves, and the lovely vistas of
blue water that went curving in and out, disappearing and anon again
appearing through jungle walls of brilliant foliage, restored the
energies dulled by long drowsing on the ocean, and fitted us for our
final cruise–our little run of a thousand miles to New
York–America–HOME.</p>
<p>We bade good-bye to “our friends the Bermudians,“ as our programme
hath it–the majority of those we were most intimate with were
negroes–and courted the great deep again. I said the majority. We knew
more negroes than white people, because we had a deal of washing to be
done, but we made some most excellent friends among the whites, whom it
will be a pleasant duty to hold long in grateful remembrance.</p>
<p>We sailed, and from that hour all idling ceased. Such another system
of overhauling, general littering of cabins and packing of trunks we had
not seen since we let go the anchor in the harbor of Beirout. Every body
was busy. Lists of all purchases had to be made out, and values
attached, to facilitate matters at the custom-house. Purchases bought by
bulk in partnership had to be equitably divided, outstanding debts
canceled, accounts compared, and trunks, boxes and packages labeled. All
day long the bustle and confusion continued.</p>
<p>And now came our first accident. A passenger was running through a
gangway, between decks, one stormy night, when he caught his foot in the
iron staple of a door that had been heedlessly left off a hatchway, and
the bones of his leg broke at the ancle. It was our first serious
misfortune. We had traveled much more than twenty thousand miles, by
land and sea, in many trying climates, without a single hurt, without a
serious case of sickness and without a death among five and sixty
passengers. Our good fortune had been wonderful. A sailor had jumped
overboard at Constantinople one night, and was seen no more, but it was
suspected that his object was to desert, and there was a slim chance, at
least, that he reached the shore. But the passenger list was complete.
There was no name missing from the register.</p>
<p>At last, one pleasant morning, we steamed up the harbor of New York,
all on deck, all dressed in Christian garb–by special order, for there
was a latent disposition in some quarters to come out as Turks–and amid
a waving of handkerchiefs from welcoming friends, the glad pilgrims
noted the shiver of the decks that told that ship and pier had joined
hands again and the long, strange cruise was over. Amen.</p>
