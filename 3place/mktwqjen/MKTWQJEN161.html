<h4 id="chapter-xvii.">CHAPTER XVII.</h4>
<p>—-“We have view’d it, And measur’d it within all, by the scale The
richest tract of land, love, in the kingdom! There will be made
seventeen or eighteeen millions, Or more, as’t may be handled!“ The
Devil is an Ass.</p>
<p>Nobody dressed more like an engineer than Mr. Henry Brierly. The
completeness of his appointments was the envy of the corps, and the gay
fellow himself was the admiration of the camp servants, axemen,
teamsters and cooks.</p>
<p>“I reckon you didn’t git them boots no wher’s this side o’ Sent
Louis?“ queried the tall Missouri youth who acted as commissariy’s
assistant.</p>
<p>“No, New York.“</p>
<p>“Yas, I’ve heern o’ New York,“ continued the butternut lad,
attentively studying each item of Harry’s dress, and endeavoring to
cover his design with interesting conversation. “’N there’s
Massachusetts.“,</p>
<p>“It’s not far off.“</p>
<p>“I’ve heern Massachusetts was a—–of a place. Les, see, what state’s
Massachusetts in?“</p>
<p>“Massachusetts,“ kindly replied Harry, “is in the state of
Boston.“</p>
<p>“Abolish’n wan’t it? They must a cost right smart,“ referring to the
boots.</p>
<p>Harry shouldered his rod and went to the field, tramped over the
prairie by day, and figured up results at night, with the utmost
cheerfulness and industry, and plotted the line on the profile paper,
without, however, the least idea of engineering practical or
theoretical. Perhaps there was not a great deal of scientific knowledge
in the entire corps, nor was very much needed. They were making, what is
called a preliminary survey, and the chief object of a preliminary
survey was to get up an excitement about the road, to interest every
town in that part of the state in it, under the belief that the road
would run through it, and to get the aid of every planter upon the
prospect that a station would be on his land.</p>
<p>Mr. Jeff Thompson was the most popular engineer who could be found
for this work. He did not bother himself much about details or
practicabilities of location, but ran merrily along, sighting from the
top of one divide to the top of another, and striking “plumb“ every town
site and big plantation within twenty or thirty miles of his route. In
his own language he “just went booming.“</p>
<p>This course gave Harry an opportunity, as he said, to learn the
practical details of engineering, and it gave Philip a chance to see the
country, and to judge for himself what prospect of a fortune it offered.
Both he and Harry got the “refusal“ of more than one plantation as they
went along, and wrote urgent letters to their eastern correspondents,
upon the beauty of the land and the certainty that it would quadruple in
value as soon as the road was finally located. It seemed strange to them
that capitalists did not flock out there and secure this land.</p>
<p>They had not been in the field over two weeks when Harry wrote to his
friend Col. Sellers that he’d better be on the move, for the line was
certain to go to Stone’s Landing. Any one who looked at the line on the
map, as it was laid down from day to day, would have been uncertain
which way it was going; but Jeff had declared that in his judgment the
only practicable route from the point they then stood on was to follow
the divide to Stone’s Landing, and it was generally understood that that
town would be the next one hit.</p>
<p>“We’ll make it, boys,“ said the chief, “if we have to go in a
balloon.“</p>
<p>And make it they did In less than a week, this indomitable engineer
had carried his moving caravan over slues and branches, across bottoms
and along divides, and pitched his tents in the very heart of the city
of Stone’s Landing.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll be dashed,“ was heard the cheery voice of Mr. Thompson,
as he stepped outside the tent door at sunrise next morning. “If this
don’t get me. I say, yon, Grayson, get out your sighting iron and see if
you can find old Sellers’ town. Blame me if we wouldn’t have run plumb
by it if twilight had held on a little longer. Oh! Sterling, Brierly,
get up and see the city. There’s a steamboat just coming round the
bend.“ And Jeff roared with laughter. “The mayor’ll be round here to
breakfast.“</p>
<p>The fellows turned out of the tents, rubbing their eyes, and stared
about them. They were camped on the second bench of the narrow bottom of
a crooked, sluggish stream, that was some five rods wide in the present
good stage of water. Before them were a dozen log cabins, with stick and
mud chimneys, irregularly disposed on either side of a not very well
defined road, which did not seem to know its own mind exactly, and,
after straggling through the town, wandered off over the rolling prairie
in an uncertain way, as if it had started for nowhere and was quite
likely to reach its destination. Just as it left the town, however, it
was cheered and assisted by a guide-board, upon which was the legend “10
Mils to Hawkeye.“</p>
<p>The road had never been made except by the travel over it, and at
this season–the rainy June–it was a way of ruts cut in the black soil,
and of fathomless mud-holes. In the principal street of the city, it had
received more attention; for hogs; great and small, rooted about in it
and wallowed in it, turning the street into a liquid quagmire which
could only be crossed on pieces of plank thrown here and there.</p>
<p>About the chief cabin, which was the store and grocery of this mart
of trade, the mud was more liquid than elsewhere, and the rude platform
in front of it and the dry-goods boxes mounted thereon were places of
refuge for all the loafers of the place. Down by the stream was a
dilapidated building which served for a hemp warehouse, and a shaky
wharf extended out from it, into the water. In fact a flat-boat was
there moored by it, it’s setting poles lying across the gunwales. Above
the town the stream was crossed by a crazy wooden bridge, the supports
of which leaned all ways in the soggy soil; the absence of a plank here
and there in the flooring made the crossing of the bridge faster than a
walk an offense not necessary to be prohibited by law.</p>
<p>“This, gentlemen,“ said Jeff, “is Columbus River, alias Goose Run. If
it was widened, and deepened, and straightened, and made, long enough,
it would be one of the finest rivers in the western country.“</p>
<p>As the sun rose and sent his level beams along the stream, the thin
stratum of mist, or malaria, rose also and dispersed, but the light was
not able to enliven the dull water nor give any hint of its apparently
fathomless depth. Venerable mud-turtles crawled up and roosted upon the
old logs in the stream, their backs glistening in the sun, the first
inhabitants of the metropolis to begin the active business of the
day.</p>
<p>It was not long, however, before smoke began to issue from the city
chimneys; and before the engineers, had finished their breakfast they
were the object of the curious inspection of six or eight boys and men,
who lounged into the camp and gazed about them with languid interest,
their hands in their pockets every one.</p>
<p>“Good morning; gentlemen,“ called out the chief engineer, from the
table.</p>
<p>“Good mawning,“ drawled out the spokesman of the party. “I allow
thish-yers the railroad, I heern it was a-comin’.“</p>
<p>“Yes, this is the railroad; all but the rails and the ironhorse.“</p>
<p>“I reckon you kin git all the rails you want oaten my white oak
timber over, thar,“ replied the first speaker, who appeared to be a man
of property and willing to strike up a trade.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to negotiate with the contractors about the rails, sir,“
said Jeff; “here’s Mr. Brierly, I’ve no doubt would like to buy your
rails when the time comes.“</p>
<p>“O,“ said the man, “I thought maybe you’d fetch the whole bilin along
with you. But if you want rails, I’ve got em, haint I Eph.“</p>
<p>“Heaps,“ said Eph, without taking his eyes off the group at the
table.</p>
<p>“Well,“ said Mr. Thompson, rising from his seat and moving towards
his tent, “the railroad has come to Stone’s Landing, sure; I move we
take a drink on it all round.“</p>
<p>The proposal met with universal favor. Jeff gave prosperity to
Stone’s Landing and navigation to Goose Run, and the toast was washed
down with gusto, in the simple fluid of corn; and with the return
compliment that a rail road was a good thing, and that Jeff Thompson was
no slouch.</p>
<p>About ten o’clock a horse and wagon was descried making a slow
approach to the camp over the prairie. As it drew near, the wagon was
seen to contain a portly gentleman, who hitched impatiently forward on
his seat, shook the reins and gently touched up his horse, in the vain
attempt to communicate his own energy to that dull beast, and looked
eagerly at the tents. When the conveyance at length drew up to
Mr. Thompson’s door, the gentleman descended with great deliberation,
straightened himself up, rubbed his hands, and beaming satisfaction from
every part of his radiant frame, advanced to the group that was gathered
to welcome him, and which had saluted him by name as soon as he came
within hearing.</p>
<p>“Welcome to Napoleon, gentlemen, welcome. I am proud to see you here
Mr. Thompson. You are, looking well Mr. Sterling. This is the country,
sir. Right glad to see you Mr. Brierly. You got that basket of
champagne? No? Those blasted river thieves! I’ll never send anything
more by ’em. The best brand, Roederer. The last I had in my cellar, from
a lot sent me by Sir George Gore–took him out on a buffalo hunt, when he
visited our, country. Is always sending me some trifle. You haven’t
looked about any yet, gentlemen? It’s in the rough yet, in the rough.
Those buildings will all have to come down. That’s the place for the
public square, Court House, hotels, churches, jail–all that sort of
thing. About where we stand, the deepo. How does that strike your
engineering eye, Mr. Thompson? Down yonder the business streets, running
to the wharves. The University up there, on rising ground, sightly
place, see the river for miles. That’s Columbus river, only forty-nine
miles to the Missouri. You see what it is, placid, steady, no current to
interfere with navigation, wants widening in places and dredging, dredge
out the harbor and raise a levee in front of the town; made by nature on
purpose for a mart. Look at all this country, not another building
within ten miles, no other navigable stream, lay of the land points
right here; hemp, tobacco, corn, must come here. The railroad will do
it, Napoleon won’t know itself in a year.“</p>
<p>“Don’t now evidently,“ said Philip aside to Harry. “Have you
breakfasted Colonel?“</p>
<p>“Hastily. Cup of coffee. Can’t trust any coffee I don’t import
myself. But I put up a basket of provisions,–wife would put in a few
delicacies, women always will, and a half dozen of that Burgundy, I was
telling you of Mr. Briefly. By the way, you never got to dine with me.“
And the Colonel strode away to the wagon and looked under the seat for
the basket.</p>
<p>Apparently it was not there. For the Colonel raised up the flap,
looked in front and behind, and then exclaimed,</p>
<p>“Confound it. That comes of not doing a thing yourself. I trusted to
the women folks to set that basket in the wagon, and it ain’t
there.“</p>
<p>The camp cook speedily prepared a savory breakfast for the Colonel,
broiled chicken, eggs, corn-bread, and coffee, to which he did ample
justice, and topped off with a drop of Old Bourbon, from Mr. Thompson’s
private store, a brand which he said he knew well, he should think it
came from his own sideboard.</p>
<p>While the engineer corps went to the field, to run back a couple of
miles and ascertain, approximately, if a road could ever get down to the
Landing, and to sight ahead across the Run, and see if it could ever get
out again, Col. Sellers and Harry sat down and began to roughly map out
the city of Napoleon on a large piece of drawing paper.</p>
<p>“I’ve got the refusal of a mile square here,“ said the Colonel, “in
our names, for a year, with a quarter interest reserved for the four
owners.“</p>
<p>They laid out the town liberally, not lacking room, leaving space for
the railroad to come in, and for the river as it was to be when
improved.</p>
<p>The engineers reported that the railroad could come in, by taking a
little sweep and crossing the stream on a high bridge, but the grades
would be steep. Col. Sellers said he didn’t care so much about the
grades, if the road could only be made to reach the elevators on the
river. The next day Mr. Thompson made a hasty survey of the stream for a
mile or two, so that the Colonel and Harry were enabled to show on their
map how nobly that would accommodate the city. Jeff took a little
writing from the Colonel and Harry for a prospective share but Philip
declined to join in, saying that he had no money, and didn’t want to
make engagements he couldn’t fulfill.</p>
<p>The next morning the camp moved on, followed till it was out of sight
by the listless eyes of the group in front of the store, one of whom
remarked that, “he’d be doggoned if he ever expected to see that
railroad any mo’.“</p>
<p>Harry went with the Colonel to Hawkeye to complete their
arrangements, a part of which was the preparation of a petition to
congress for the improvement of the navigation of Columbus River.</p>
