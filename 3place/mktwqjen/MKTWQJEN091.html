<h4 id="chapter-xxv.">CHAPTER XXV.</h4>
<p>Originally, Nevada was a part of Utah and was called Carson county;
and a pretty large county it was, too. Certain of its valleys produced
no end of hay, and this attracted small colonies of Mormon stock-raisers
and farmers to them. A few orthodox Americans straggled in from
California, but no love was lost between the two classes of colonists.
There was little or no friendly intercourse; each party staid to itself.
The Mormons were largely in the majority, and had the additional
advantage of being peculiarly under the protection of the Mormon
government of the Territory. Therefore they could afford to be distant,
and even peremptory toward their neighbors. One of the traditions of
Carson Valley illustrates the condition of things that prevailed at the
time I speak of. The hired girl of one of the American families was
Irish, and a Catholic; yet it was noted with surprise that she was the
only person outside of the Mormon ring who could get favors from the
Mormons. She asked kindnesses of them often, and always got them. It was
a mystery to everybody. But one day as she was passing out at the door,
a large bowie knife dropped from under her apron, and when her mistress
asked for an explanation she observed that she was going out to “borry a
wash-tub from the Mormons!“</p>
<p>In 1858 silver lodes were discovered in “Carson County,“ and then the
aspect of things changed. Californians began to flock in, and the
American element was soon in the majority. Allegiance to Brigham Young
and Utah was renounced, and a temporary territorial government for
“Washoe“ was instituted by the citizens. Governor Roop was the first and
only chief magistrate of it. In due course of time Congress passed a
bill to organize “Nevada Territory,“ and President Lincoln sent out
Governor Nye to supplant Roop.</p>
<p>At this time the population of the Territory was about twelve or
fifteen thousand, and rapidly increasing. Silver mines were being
vigorously developed and silver mills erected. Business of all kinds was
active and prosperous and growing more so day by day.</p>
<p>The people were glad to have a legitimately constituted government,
but did not particularly enjoy having strangers from distant States put
in authority over them–a sentiment that was natural enough. They thought
the officials should have been chosen from among themselves from among
prominent citizens who had earned a right to such promotion, and who
would be in sympathy with the populace and likewise thoroughly
acquainted with the needs of the Territory. They were right in viewing
the matter thus, without doubt. The new officers were “emigrants,“ and
that was no title to anybody’s affection or admiration either.</p>
<p>The new government was received with considerable coolness. It was
not only a foreign intruder, but a poor one. It was not even worth
plucking –except by the smallest of small fry office-seekers and such.
Everybody knew that Congress had appropriated only twenty thousand
dollars a year in greenbacks for its support–about money enough to run a
quartz mill a month. And everybody knew, also, that the first year’s
money was still in Washington, and that the getting hold of it would be
a tedious and difficult process. Carson City was too wary and too wise
to open up a credit account with the imported bantling with anything
like indecent haste.</p>
<p>There is something solemnly funny about the struggles of a new-born
Territorial government to get a start in this world. Ours had a trying
time of it. The Organic Act and the “instructions“ from the State
Department commanded that a legislature should be elected at
such-and-such a time, and its sittings inaugurated at such-and-such a
date. It was easy to get legislators, even at three dollars a day,
although board was four dollars and fifty cents, for distinction has its
charm in Nevada as well as elsewhere, and there were plenty of patriotic
souls out of employment; but to get a legislative hall for them to meet
in was another matter altogether. Carson blandly declined to give a room
rent-free, or let one to the government on credit.</p>
<p>But when Curry heard of the difficulty, he came forward, solitary and
alone, and shouldered the Ship of State over the bar and got her afloat
again. I refer to “Curry–Old Curry–Old Abe Curry.“ But for him the
legislature would have been obliged to sit in the desert. He offered his
large stone building just outside the capital limits, rent-free, and it
was gladly accepted. Then he built a horse-railroad from town to the
capitol, and carried the legislators gratis.</p>
<p>He also furnished pine benches and chairs for the legislature, and
covered the floors with clean saw-dust by way of carpet and spittoon
combined. But for Curry the government would have died in its tender
infancy. A canvas partition to separate the Senate from the House of
Representatives was put up by the Secretary, at a cost of three dollars
and forty cents, but the United States declined to pay for it. Upon
being reminded that the “instructions“ permitted the payment of a
liberal rent for a legislative hall, and that that money was saved to
the country by Mr. Curry’s generosity, the United States said that did
not alter the matter, and the three dollars and forty cents would be
subtracted from the Secretary’s eighteen hundred dollar salary–and it
was!</p>
<p>The matter of printing was from the beginning an interesting feature
of the new government’s difficulties. The Secretary was sworn to obey
his volume of written “instructions,“ and these commanded him to do two
certain things without fail, viz.:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Get the House and Senate journals printed; and, 2. For this work,
pay one dollar and fifty cents per “thousand“ for composition, and one
dollar and fifty cents per “token“ for press-work, in greenbacks.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was easy to swear to do these two things, but it was entirely
impossible to do more than one of them. When greenbacks had gone down to
forty cents on the dollar, the prices regularly charged everybody by
printing establishments were one dollar and fifty cents per “thousand“
and one dollar and fifty cents per “token,“ in gold. The “instructions“
commanded that the Secretary regard a paper dollar issued by the
government as equal to any other dollar issued by the government. Hence
the printing of the journals was discontinued. Then the United States
sternly rebuked the Secretary for disregarding the “instructions,“ and
warned him to correct his ways. Wherefore he got some printing done,
forwarded the bill to Washington with full exhibits of the high prices
of things in the Territory, and called attention to a printed market
report wherein it would be observed that even hay was two hundred and
fifty dollars a ton. The United States responded by subtracting the
printing-bill from the Secretary’s suffering salary–and moreover
remarked with dense gravity that he would find nothing in his
“instructions“ requiring him to purchase hay!</p>
<p>Nothing in this world is palled in such impenetrable obscurity as a
U.S. Treasury Comptroller’s understanding. The very fires of the
hereafter could get up nothing more than a fitful glimmer in it. In the
days I speak of he never could be made to comprehend why it was that
twenty thousand dollars would not go as far in Nevada, where all
commodities ranged at an enormous figure, as it would in the other
Territories, where exceeding cheapness was the rule. He was an officer
who looked out for the little expenses all the time. The Secretary of
the Territory kept his office in his bedroom, as I before remarked; and
he charged the United States no rent, although his “instructions“
provided for that item and he could have justly taken advantage of it (a
thing which I would have done with more than lightning promptness if I
had been Secretary myself). But the United States never applauded this
devotion. Indeed, I think my country was ashamed to have so improvident
a person in its employ.</p>
<p>Those “instructions“ (we used to read a chapter from them every
morning, as intellectual gymnastics, and a couple of chapters in Sunday
school every Sabbath, for they treated of all subjects under the sun and
had much valuable religious matter in them along with the other
statistics) those “instructions“ commanded that pen-knives, envelopes,
pens and writing-paper be furnished the members of the legislature. So
the Secretary made the purchase and the distribution. The knives cost
three dollars apiece. There was one too many, and the Secretary gave it
to the Clerk of the House of Representatives. The United States said the
Clerk of the House was not a “member“ of the legislature, and took that
three dollars out of the Secretary’s salary, as usual.</p>
<p>White men charged three or four dollars a “load“ for sawing up
stove-wood. The Secretary was sagacious enough to know that the United
States would never pay any such price as that; so he got an Indian to
saw up a load of office wood at one dollar and a half. He made out the
usual voucher, but signed no name to it–simply appended a note
explaining that an Indian had done the work, and had done it in a very
capable and satisfactory way, but could not sign the voucher owing to
lack of ability in the necessary direction. The Secretary had to pay
that dollar and a half. He thought the United States would admire both
his economy and his honesty in getting the work done at half price and
not putting a pretended Indian’s signature to the voucher, but the
United States did not see it in that light.</p>
<p>The United States was too much accustomed to employing
dollar-and-a-half thieves in all manner of official capacities to regard
his explanation of the voucher as having any foundation in fact.</p>
<p>But the next time the Indian sawed wood for us I taught him to make a
cross at the bottom of the voucher–it looked like a cross that had been
drunk a year–and then I “witnessed“ it and it went through all right.
The United States never said a word. I was sorry I had not made the
voucher for a thousand loads of wood instead of one.</p>
<p>The government of my country snubs honest simplicity but fondles
artistic villainy, and I think I might have developed into a very
capable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or
two.</p>
<p>That was a fine collection of sovereigns, that first Nevada
legislature. They levied taxes to the amount of thirty or forty thousand
dollars and ordered expenditures to the extent of about a million. Yet
they had their little periodical explosions of economy like all other
bodies of the kind. A member proposed to save three dollars a day to the
nation by dispensing with the Chaplain. And yet that short-sighted man
needed the Chaplain more than any other member, perhaps, for he
generally sat with his feet on his desk, eating raw turnips, during the
morning prayer.</p>
<p>The legislature sat sixty days, and passed private tollroad
franchises all the time. When they adjourned it was estimated that every
citizen owned about three franchises, and it was believed that unless
Congress gave the Territory another degree of longitude there would not
be room enough to accommodate the toll-roads. The ends of them were
hanging over the boundary line everywhere like a fringe.</p>
<p>The fact is, the freighting business had grown to such important
proportions that there was nearly as much excitement over suddenly
acquired toll-road fortunes as over the wonderful silver mines.</p>
