<h4 id="chapter-lix.">CHAPTER LIX.</h4>
<p>We were at sea now, for a very long voyage–we were to pass through
the entire length of the Levant; through the entire length of the
Mediterranean proper, also, and then cross the full width of the
Atlantic–a voyage of several weeks. We naturally settled down into a
very slow, stay-at-home manner of life, and resolved to be quiet,
exemplary people, and roam no more for twenty or thirty days. No more,
at least, than from stem to stern of the ship. It was a very comfortable
prospect, though, for we were tired and needed a long rest.</p>
<p>We were all lazy and satisfied, now, as the meager entries in my
note-book (that sure index, to me, of my condition), prove. What a
stupid thing a note-book gets to be at sea, any way. Please observe the
style:</p>
<p>“Sunday–Services, as usual, at four bells. Services at night, also.
No cards.</p>
<p>“Monday–Beautiful day, but rained hard. The cattle purchased at
Alexandria for beef ought to be shingled. Or else fattened. The water
stands in deep puddles in the depressions forward of their after
shoulders. Also here and there all over their backs. It is well they are
not cows–it would soak in and ruin the milk. The poor devil
eagle–[Afterwards presented to the Central Park.]–from Syria looks
miserable and droopy in the rain, perched on the forward capstan. He
appears to have his own opinion of a sea voyage, and if it were put into
language and the language solidified, it would probably essentially dam
the widest river in the world.</p>
<p>“Tuesday–Somewhere in the neighborhood of the island of Malta. Can
not stop there. Cholera. Weather very stormy. Many passengers seasick
and invisible.</p>
<p>“Wednesday–Weather still very savage. Storm blew two land birds to
sea, and they came on board. A hawk was blown off, also. He circled
round and round the ship, wanting to light, but afraid of the people. He
was so tired, though, that he had to light, at last, or perish. He
stopped in the foretop, repeatedly, and was as often blown away by the
wind. At last Harry caught him. Sea full of flying-fish. They rise in
flocks of three hundred and flash along above the tops of the waves a
distance of two or three hundred feet, then fall and disappear.</p>
<p>“Thursday–Anchored off Algiers, Africa. Beautiful city, beautiful
green hilly landscape behind it. Staid half a day and left. Not
permitted to land, though we showed a clean bill of health. They were
afraid of Egyptian plague and cholera.</p>
<p>“Friday–Morning, dominoes. Afternoon, dominoes. Evening, promenading
the deck. Afterwards, charades.</p>
<p>“Saturday–Morning, dominoes. Afternoon, dominoes. Evening,
promenading the decks. Afterwards, dominoes.</p>
<p>“Sunday–Morning service, four bells. Evening service, eight bells.
Monotony till midnight.–Whereupon, dominoes.</p>
<p>“Monday–Morning, dominoes. Afternoon, dominoes. Evening, promenading
the decks. Afterward, charades and a lecture from Dr. C. Dominoes.</p>
<p>“No date–Anchored off the picturesque city of Cagliari, Sardinia.
Staid till midnight, but not permitted to land by these infamous
foreigners. They smell inodorously–they do not wash–they dare not risk
cholera.</p>
<p>“Thursday–Anchored off the beautiful cathedral city of Malaga,
Spain.–Went ashore in the captain’s boat–not ashore, either, for they
would not let us land. Quarantine. Shipped my newspaper correspondence,
which they took with tongs, dipped it in sea water, clipped it full of
holes, and then fumigated it with villainous vapors till it smelt like a
Spaniard. Inquired about chances to run to blockade and visit the
Alhambra at Granada. Too risky–they might hang a body. Set sail–middle
of afternoon.</p>
<p>“And so on, and so on, and so forth, for several days. Finally,
anchored off Gibraltar, which looks familiar and home-like.“</p>
<p>It reminds me of the journal I opened with the New Year, once, when I
was a boy and a confiding and a willing prey to those impossible schemes
of reform which well-meaning old maids and grandmothers set for the feet
of unwary youths at that season of the year–setting oversized tasks for
them, which, necessarily failing, as infallibly weaken the boy’s
strength of will, diminish his confidence in himself and injure his
chances of success in life. Please accept of an extract:</p>
<p>“Monday–Got up, washed, went to bed. “Tuesday–Got up, washed, went to
bed. “Wednesday–Got up, washed, went to bed. “Thursday–Got up, washed,
went to bed. “Friday–Got up, washed, went to bed. “Next Friday–Got up,
washed, went to bed. “Friday fortnight–Got up, washed, went to bed.
“Following month–Got up, washed, went to bed.“</p>
<p>I stopped, then, discouraged. Startling events appeared to be too
rare, in my career, to render a diary necessary. I still reflect with
pride, however, that even at that early age I washed when I got up. That
journal finished me. I never have had the nerve to keep one since. My
loss of confidence in myself in that line was permanent.</p>
<p>The ship had to stay a week or more at Gibraltar to take in coal for
the home voyage.</p>
<p>It would be very tiresome staying here, and so four of us ran the
quarantine blockade and spent seven delightful days in Seville, Cordova,
Cadiz, and wandering through the pleasant rural scenery of Andalusia,
the garden of Old Spain. The experiences of that cheery week were too
varied and numerous for a short chapter and I have not room for a long
one. Therefore I shall leave them all out.</p>
