<h4 id="italian-without-a-master">ITALIAN WITHOUT A MASTER</h4>
<p>It is almost a fortnight now that I am domiciled in a medieval villa
in the country, a mile or two from Florence. I cannot speak the
language; I am too old not to learn how, also too busy when I am busy,
and too indolent when I am not; wherefore some will imagine that I am
having a dull time of it. But it is not so. The “help“ are all natives;
they talk Italian to me, I answer in English; I do not understand them,
they do not understand me, consequently no harm is done, and everybody
is satisfied. In order to be just and fair, I throw in an Italian word
when I have one, and this has a good influence. I get the word out of
the morning paper. I have to use it while it is fresh, for I find that
Italian words do not keep in this climate. They fade toward night, and
next morning they are gone. But it is no matter; I get a new one out of
the paper before breakfast, and thrill the domestics with it while it
lasts. I have no dictionary, and I do not want one; I can select words
by the sound, or by orthographic aspect. Many of them have French or
German or English look, and these are the ones I enslave for the day’s
service. That is, as a rule. Not always. If I find a learnable phrase
that has an imposing look and warbles musically along I do not care to
know the meaning of it; I pay it out to the first applicant, knowing
that if I pronounce it carefully HE will understand it, and that’s
enough.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s word was AVANTI. It sounds Shakespearian, and probably
means Avaunt and quit my sight. Today I have a whole phrase: SONO
DISPIACENTISSIMO. I do not know what it means, but it seems to fit in
everywhere and give satisfaction. Although as a rule my words and
phrases are good for one day and train only, I have several that stay by
me all the time, for some unknown reason, and these come very handy when
I get into a long conversation and need things to fire up with in
monotonous stretches. One of the best ones is DOV’ `E IL GATTO. It
nearly always produces a pleasant surprise, therefore I save it up for
places where I want to express applause or admiration. The fourth word
has a French sound, and I think the phrase means “that takes the
cake.“</p>
<p>During my first week in the deep and dreamy stillness of this woodsy
and flowery place I was without news of the outside world, and was well
content without it. It has been four weeks since I had seen a newspaper,
and this lack seemed to give life a new charm and grace, and to saturate
it with a feeling verging upon actual delight. Then came a change that
was to be expected: the appetite for news began to rise again, after
this invigorating rest. I had to feed it, but I was not willing to let
it make me its helpless slave again; I determined to put it on a diet,
and a strict and limited one. So I examined an Italian paper, with the
idea of feeding it on that, and on that exclusively. On that
exclusively, and without help of a dictionary. In this way I should
surely be well protected against overloading and indigestion.</p>
<p>A glance at the telegraphic page filled me with encouragement. There
were no scare-heads. That was good–supremely good. But there were
headings–one-liners and two-liners–and that was good too; for without
these, one must do as one does with a German paper–pay our precious time
in finding out what an article is about, only to discover, in many
cases, that there is nothing in it of interest to you. The headline is a
valuable thing.</p>
<p>Necessarily we are all fond of murders, scandals, swindles,
robberies, explosions, collisions, and all such things, when we knew the
people, and when they are neighbors and friends, but when they are
strangers we do not get any great pleasure out of them, as a rule. Now
the trouble with an American paper is that it has no discrimination; it
rakes the whole earth for blood and garbage, and the result is that you
are daily overfed and suffer a surfeit. By habit you stow this muck
every day, but you come by and by to take no vital interest in
it–indeed, you almost get tired of it. As a rule, forty-nine-fiftieths
of it concerns strangers only –people away off yonder, a thousand miles,
two thousand miles, ten thousand miles from where you are. Why, when you
come to think of it, who cares what becomes of those people? I would not
give the assassination of one personal friend for a whole massacre of
those others. And, to my mind, one relative or neighbor mixed up in a
scandal is more interesting than a whole Sodom and Gomorrah of
outlanders gone rotten. Give me the home product every time.</p>
<p>Very well. I saw at a glance that the Florentine paper would suit me:
five out of six of its scandals and tragedies were local; they were
adventures of one’s very neighbors, one might almost say one’s friends.
In the matter of world news there was not too much, but just about
enough. I subscribed. I have had no occasion to regret it. Every morning
I get all the news I need for the day; sometimes from the headlines,
sometimes from the text. I have never had to call for a dictionary yet.
I read the paper with ease. Often I do not quite understand, often some
of the details escape me, but no matter, I get the idea. I will cut out
a passage or two, then you see how limpid the language is:</p>
<p>Il ritorno dei Beati d’Italia</p>
<p>Elargizione del Re all’ Ospedale italiano</p>
<p>The first line means that the Italian sovereigns are coming back
–they have been to England. The second line seems to mean that they
enlarged the King at the Italian hospital. With a banquet, I suppose. An
English banquet has that effect. Further:</p>
<p>Il ritorno dei Sovrani</p>
<p>a Roma</p>
<p>ROMA, 24, ore 22,50.–I Sovrani e le Principessine Reali si attendono
a Roma domani alle ore 15,51.</p>
<p>Return of the sovereigns to Rome, you see. Date of the telegram,
Rome, November 24, ten minutes before twenty-three o’clock. The telegram
seems to say, “The Sovereigns and the Royal Children expect themselves
at Rome tomorrow at fifty-one minutes after fifteen o’clock.“</p>
<p>I do not know about Italian time, but I judge it begins at midnight
and runs through the twenty-four hours without breaking bulk. In the
following ad, the theaters open at half-past twenty. If these are not
matinees, 20.30 must mean 8.30 P.M., by my reckoning.</p>
<p>Spettacolli del di 25</p>
<p>TEATRO DELLA PERGOLA–(Ore 20,30)–Opera. BOH`EME. TEATRO
ALFIERI.–Compagnia drammatica Drago–(Ore 20,30)–LA LEGGE. ALHAMBRA–(Ore
20,30)–Spettacolo variato. SALA EDISON –Grandiosoo spettacolo
Cinematografico: QUO VADIS?–Inaugurazione della Chiesa Russa–In coda al
Direttissimo–Vedute di Firenze con gran movimeno–America: Transporto
tronchi giganteschi–I ladri in casa del Diavolo–Scene comiche.
CINEMATOGRAFO–Via Brunelleschi n. 4.–Programma straordinario, DON
CHISCIOTTE–Prezzi populari.</p>
<p>The whole of that is intelligible to me–and sane and rational, too
–except the remark about the Inauguration of a Russian Chinese. That one
oversizes my hand. Give me five cards.</p>
<p>This is a four-page paper; and as it is set in long primer leaded and
has a page of advertisements, there is no room for the crimes,
disasters, and general sweepings of the outside world–thanks be! Today I
find only a single importation of the off-color sort:</p>
<p>Una Principessa</p>
<p>che fugge con un cocchiere</p>
<p>PARIGI, 24.–Il MATIN ha da Berlino che la principessa
Schovenbare-Waldenbure scomparve il 9 novembre. Sarebbe partita col suo
cocchiere.</p>
<p>La Principassa ha 27 anni.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven years old, and scomparve–scampered–on the 9th November.
You see by the added detail that she departed with her coachman. I hope
Sarebbe has not made a mistake, but I am afraid the chances are that she
has. SONO DISPIACENTISSIMO.</p>
<p>There are several fires: also a couple of accidents. This is one of
them:</p>
<p>Grave disgrazia sul Ponte Vecchio</p>
<p>Stammattina, circe le 7,30, mentre Giuseppe Sciatti, di anni 55, di
Casellina e Torri, passava dal Ponte Vecchio, stando seduto sopra un
barroccio carico di verdura, perse l’ equilibrio e cadde al suolo,
rimanendo con la gamba destra sotto una ruota del veicolo.</p>
<p>Lo Sciatti fu subito raccolto da alcuni cittadini, che, per mezzo
della pubblica vettura n. 365, lo transporto a San Giovanni di Dio.</p>
<p>Ivi il medico di guardia gli riscontro la frattura della gamba destra
e alcune lievi escoriazioni giudicandolo guaribile in 50 giorni salvo
complicazioni.</p>
<p>What it seems to say is this: “Serious Disgrace on the Old Old
Bridge. This morning about 7.30, Mr. Joseph Sciatti, aged 55, of
Casellina and Torri, while standing up in a sitting posture on top of a
carico barrow of vedure (foliage? hay? vegetables?), lost his
equilibrium and fell on himself, arriving with his left leg under one of
the wheels of the vehicle.</p>
<p>“Said Sciatti was suddenly harvested (gathered in?) by several
citizens, who by means of public cab No. 365 transported to St. John of
God.“</p>
<p>Paragraph No. 3 is a little obscure, but I think it says that the
medico set the broken left leg–right enough, since there was nothing the
matter with the other one–and that several are encouraged to hope that
fifty days well fetch him around in quite giudicandolo-guaribile way, if
no complications intervene.</p>
<p>I am sure I hope so myself.</p>
<p>There is a great and peculiar charm about reading news-scraps in a
language which you are not acquainted with–the charm that always goes
with the mysterious and the uncertain. You can never be absolutely sure
of the meaning of anything you read in such circumstances; you are
chasing an alert and gamy riddle all the time, and the baffling turns
and dodges of the prey make the life of the hunt. A dictionary would
spoil it. Sometimes a single word of doubtful purport will cast a veil
of dreamy and golden uncertainty over a whole paragraph of cold and
practical certainties, and leave steeped in a haunting and adorable
mystery an incident which had been vulgar and commonplace but for that
benefaction. Would you be wise to draw a dictionary on that gracious
word? would you be properly grateful?</p>
<p>After a couple of days’ rest I now come back to my subject and seek a
case in point. I find it without trouble, in the morning paper; a
cablegram from Chicago and Indiana by way of Paris. All the words save
one are guessable by a person ignorant of Italian:</p>
<p>Revolverate in teatro</p>
<p>PARIGI, 27.–La PATRIE ha da Chicago:</p>
<p>Il guardiano del teatro dell’opera di Walace (Indiana), avendo voluto
espellare uno spettatore che continuava a fumare malgrado il diviety,
questo spalleggiato dai suoi amici tir`o diversi colpi di rivoltella. Il
guardiano ripose. Nacque una scarica generale. Grande panico tra gli
spettatori. Nessun ferito.</p>
<p>TRANSLATION.–“Revolveration in Theater. PARIS, 27TH. LA PATRIE has
from Chicago: The cop of the theater of the opera of Wallace, Indiana,
had willed to expel a spectator which continued to smoke in spite of the
prohibition, who, spalleggiato by his friends, tire (Fr. TIRE, Anglice
PULLED) manifold revolver-shots; great panic among the spectators.
Nobody hurt.“</p>
<p>It is bettable that that harmless cataclysm in the theater of the
opera of Wallace, Indiana, excited not a person in Europe but me, and so
came near to not being worth cabling to Florence by way of France. But
it does excite me. It excites me because I cannot make out, for sure,
what it was that moved the spectator to resist the officer. I was
gliding along smoothly and without obstruction or accident, until I came
to that word “spalleggiato,“ then the bottom fell out. You notice what a
rich gloom, what a somber and pervading mystery, that word sheds all
over the whole Wallachian tragedy. That is the charm of the thing, that
is the delight of it. This is where you begin, this is where you revel.
You can guess and guess, and have all the fun you like; you need not be
afraid there will be an end to it; none is possible, for no amount of
guessing will ever furnish you a meaning for that word that you can be
sure is the right one. All the other words give you hints, by their
form, their sound, or their spelling–this one doesn’t, this one throws
out no hints, this one keeps its secret. If there is even the slightest
slight shadow of a hint anywhere, it lies in the very meagerly
suggestive fact that “spalleggiato“ carries our word “egg“ in its
stomach. Well, make the most out of it, and then where are you at? You
conjecture that the spectator which was smoking in spite of the
prohibition and become reprohibited by the guardians, was “egged on“ by
his friends, and that was owing to that evil influence that he initiated
the revolveration in theater that has galloped under the sea and come
crashing through the European press without exciting anybody but me. But
are you sure, are you dead sure, that that was the way of it? No. Then
the uncertainty remains, the mystery abides, and with it the charm.
Guess again.</p>
<p>If I had a phrase-book of a really satisfactory sort I would study
it, and not give all my free time to undictionarial readings, but there
is no such work on the market. The existing phrase-books are inadequate.
They are well enough as far as they go, but when you fall down and skin
your leg they don’t tell you what to say.</p>
