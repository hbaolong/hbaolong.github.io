<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>THE SECRET REVEALED.</p>
<p>It was night. Stillness reigned in the grand old feudal castle of
Klugenstein. The year 1222 was drawing to a close. Far away up in the
tallest of the castle’s towers a single light glimmered. A secret
council was being held there. The stern old lord of Klugenstein sat in a
chair of state meditating. Presently he, said, with a tender accent:</p>
<p>“My daughter!“</p>
<p>A young man of noble presence, clad from head to heel in knightly
mail, answered:</p>
<p>“Speak, father!“</p>
<p>“My daughter, the time is come for the revealing of the mystery that
hath puzzled all your young life. Know, then, that it had its birth in
the matters which I shall now unfold. My brother Ulrich is the great
Duke of Brandenburgh. Our father, on his deathbed, decreed that if no
son were born to Ulrich, the succession should pass to my house,
provided a son were born to me. And further, in case no son, were born
to either, but only daughters, then the succession should pass to
Ulrich’s daughter, if she proved stainless; if she did not, my daughter
should succeed, if she retained a blameless name. And so I, and my old
wife here, prayed fervently for the good boon of a son, but the prayer
was vain. You were born to us. I was in despair. I saw the mighty prize
slipping from my grasp, the splendid dream vanishing away. And I had
been so hopeful! Five years had Ulrich lived in wedlock, and yet his
wife had borne no heir of either sex.</p>
<p>“‘But hold,’ I said, ‘all is not lost.’ A saving scheme had shot
athwart my brain. You were born at midnight. Only the leech, the nurse,
and six waiting-women knew your sex. I hanged them every one before an
hour had sped. Next morning all the barony went mad with rejoicing over
the proclamation that a son was born to Klugenstein, an heir to mighty
Brandenburgh! And well the secret has been kept. Your mother’s own
sister nursed your infancy, and from that time forward we feared
nothing.</p>
<p>“When you were ten years old, a daughter was born to Ulrich. We
grieved, but hoped for good results from measles, or physicians, or
other natural enemies of infancy, but were always disappointed. She
lived, she throve –Heaven’s malison upon her! But it is nothing. We are
safe. For, Ha-ha! have we not a son? And is not our son the future Duke?
Our well-beloved Conrad, is it not so?–for, woman of eight-and-twenty
years –as you are, my child, none other name than that hath ever fallen
to you!</p>
<p>“Now it hath come to pass that age hath laid its hand upon my
brother, and he waxes feeble. The cares of state do tax him sore.
Therefore he wills that you shall come to him and be already Duke–in
act, though not yet in name. Your servitors are ready–you journey forth
to-night.</p>
<p>“Now listen well. Remember every word I say. There is a law as old as
Germany that if any woman sit for a single instant in the great ducal
chair before she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the people,
SHE SHALL DIE! So heed my words. Pretend humility. Pronounce your
judgments from the Premier’s chair, which stands at the foot of the
throne. Do this until you are crowned and safe. It is not likely that
your sex will ever be discovered; but still it is the part of wisdom to
make all things as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life.“</p>
<p>“Oh; my father, is it for this my life hath been a lie! Was it that I
might cheat my unoffending cousin of her rights? Spare me, father, spare
your child!“</p>
<p>“What, huzzy! Is this my reward for the august fortune my brain has
wrought for thee? By the bones of my father, this puling sentiment of
thine but ill accords with my humor.</p>
<p>“Betake thee to the Duke, instantly! And beware how thou meddlest
with my purpose!“</p>
<p>Let this suffice, of the conversation. It is enough for us to know
that the prayers, the entreaties and the tears of the gentle-natured
girl availed nothing. They nor anything could move the stout old lord of
Klugenstein. And so, at last, with a heavy heart, the daughter saw the
castle gates close behind her, and found herself riding away in the
darkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed, vassals and a brave
following of servants.</p>
<p>The old baron sat silent for many minutes after his daughter’s
departure, and then he turned to his sad wife and said:</p>
<p>“Dame, our matters seem speeding fairly. It is full three months
since I sent the shrewd and handsome Count Detzin on his devilish
mission to my brother’s daughter Constance. If he fail, we are not
wholly safe; but if he do succeed, no power can bar our girl from being
Duchess e’en though ill-fortune should decree she never should be
Duke!“</p>
<p>“My heart is full of bodings, yet all may still be well.“</p>
<p>“Tush, woman! Leave the owls to croak. To bed with ye, and dream of
Brandenburgh and grandeur!“</p>
