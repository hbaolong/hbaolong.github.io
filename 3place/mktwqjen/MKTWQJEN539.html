<h4 id="chapter-xiii.">CHAPTER XIII.</h4>
<p>The days drifted by, and they grew ever more dreary. For Barrow’s
efforts to find work for Tracy were unavailing. Always the first
question asked was, “What Union do you belong to?“</p>
<p>Tracy was obliged to reply that he didn’t belong to any
trade-union.</p>
<p>“Very well, then, it’s impossible to employ you. My men wouldn’t stay
with me if I should employ a ‘scab,’ or ‘rat,’“ or whatever the phrase
was.</p>
<p>Finally, Tracy had a happy thought. He said, “Why the thing for me to
do, of course, is to join a trade-union.“</p>
<p>“Yes,“ Barrow said, “that is the thing for you to do–if you can.“</p>
<p>“If I can? Is it difficult?“</p>
<p>“Well, Yes,“ Barrow said, “it’s sometimes difficult–in fact, very
difficult. But you can try, and of course it will be best to try.“</p>
<p>Therefore Tracy tried; but he did not succeed. He was refused
admission with a good deal of promptness, and was advised to go back
home, where he belonged, not come here taking honest men’s bread out of
their mouths. Tracy began to realize that the situation was desperate,
and the thought made him cold to the marrow. He said to himself, “So
there is an aristocracy of position here, and an aristocracy of
prosperity, and apparently there is also an aristocracy of the ins as
opposed to the outs, and I am with the outs. So the ranks grow daily,
here. Plainly there are all kinds of castes here and only one that I
belong to, the outcasts.“ But he couldn’t even smile at his small joke,
although he was obliged to confess that he had a rather good opinion of
it. He was feeling so defeated and miserable by this time that he could
no longer look with philosophical complacency on the horseplay of the
young fellows in the upper rooms at night. At first it had been pleasant
to see them unbend and have a good time after having so well earned it
by the labors of the day, but now it all rasped upon his feelings and
his dignity. He lost patience with the spectacle. When they were feeling
good, they shouted, they scuffled, they sang songs, they romped about
the place like cattle, and they generally wound up with a pillow fight,
in which they banged each other over the head, and threw the pillows in
all directions, and every now and then he got a buffet himself; and they
were always inviting him to join in. They called him “Johnny Bull,“ and
invited him with excessive familiarity to take a hand. At first he had
endured all this with good nature, but latterly he had shown by his
manner that it was distinctly distasteful to him, and very soon he saw a
change in the manner of these young people toward him. They were souring
on him as they would have expressed it in their language. He had never
been what might be called popular. That was hardly the phrase for it; he
had merely been liked, but now dislike for him was growing. His case was
not helped by the fact that he was out of luck, couldn’t get work,
didn’t belong to a union, and couldn’t gain admission to one. He got a
good many slights of that small ill-defined sort that you can’t quite
put your finger on, and it was manifest that there was only one thing
which protected him from open insult, and that was his muscle. These
young people had seen him exercising, mornings, after his cold sponge
bath, and they had perceived by his performance and the build of his
body, that he was athletic, and also versed in boxing. He felt pretty
naked now, recognizing that he was shorn of all respect except respect
for his fists. One night when he entered his room he found about a dozen
of the young fellows there carrying on a very lively conversation
punctuated with horse-laughter. The talking ceased instantly, and the
frank affront of a dead silence followed. He said,</p>
<p>“Good evening gentlemen,“ and sat down.</p>
<p>There was no response. He flushed to the temples but forced himself
to maintain silence. He sat there in this uncomfortable stillness some
time, then got up and went out.</p>
<p>The moment he had disappeared he heard a prodigious shout of laughter
break forth. He saw that their plain purpose had been to insult him. He
ascended to the flat roof, hoping to be able to cool down his spirit
there and get back his tranquility. He found the young tinner up there,
alone and brooding, and entered into conversation with him. They were
pretty fairly matched, now, in unpopularity and general ill-luck and
misery, and they had no trouble in meeting upon this common ground with
advantage and something of comfort to both. But Tracy’s movements had
been watched, and in a few minutes the tormentors came straggling one
after another to the roof, where they began to stroll up and down in an
apparently purposeless way. But presently they fell to dropping remarks
that were evidently aimed at Tracy, and some of them at the tinner. The
ringleader of this little mob was a short-haired bully and amateur
prize-fighter named Allen, who was accustomed to lording it over the
upper floor, and had more than once shown a disposition to make trouble
with Tracy. Now there was an occasional cat-call, and hootings, and
whistlings, and finally the diversion of an exchange of connected
remarks was introduced:</p>
<p>“How many does it take to make a pair?“</p>
<p>“Well, two generally makes a pair, but sometimes there ain’t stuff
enough in them to make a whole pair.“ General laugh.</p>
<p>“What were you saying about the English a while ago?“</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing, the English are all right, only–I–“</p>
<p>“What was it you said about them?“</p>
<p>“Oh, I only said they swallow well.“</p>
<p>“Swallow better than other people?“</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, the English swallow a good deal better than other
people.“</p>
<p>“What is it they swallow best?“</p>
<p>“Oh, insults.“ Another general laugh.</p>
<p>“Pretty hard to make ’em fight, ain’t it?“</p>
<p>“No, taint hard to make ’em fight.“</p>
<p>“Ain’t it, really?“</p>
<p>“No, taint hard. It’s impossible.“ Another laugh.</p>
<p>“This one’s kind of spiritless, that’s certain.“</p>
<p>“Couldn’t be the other way–in his case.“</p>
<p>“Why?“</p>
<p>“Don’t you know the secret of his birth?“</p>
<p>“No! has he got a secret of his birth?“</p>
<p>“You bet he has.“</p>
<p>“What is it?“</p>
<p>“His father was a wax-figger.“</p>
<p>Allen came strolling by where the pair were sitting; stopped, and
said to the tinner;</p>
<p>“How are you off for friends, these days?“</p>
<p>“Well enough off.“</p>
<p>“Got a good many?“</p>
<p>“Well, as many as I need.“</p>
<p>“A friend is valuable, sometimes–as a protector, you know. What do
you reckon would happen if I was to snatch your cap off and slap you in
the face with it?“</p>
<p>“Please don’t trouble me, Mr. Allen, I ain’t doing anything to
you.“</p>
<p>You answer me! What do you reckon would happen?“</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know.“</p>
<p>Tracy spoke up with a good deal of deliberation and said:</p>
<p>“Don’t trouble the young fellow, I can tell you what would
happen.“</p>
<p>“Oh, you can, can you? Boys, Johnny Bull can tell us what would
happen if I was to snatch this chump’s cap off and slap him in the face
with it. Now you’ll see.“</p>
<p>He snatched the cap and struck the youth in the face, and before he
could inquire what was going to happen, it had already happened, and he
was warming the tin with the broad of his back. Instantly there was a
rush, and shouts of:</p>
<p>“A ring, a ring, make a ring! Fair play all round! Johnny’s grit;
give him a chance.“</p>
<p>The ring was quickly chalked on the tin, and Tracy found himself as
eager to begin as he could have been if his antagonist had been a prince
instead of a mechanic. At bottom he was a little surprised at this,
because although his theories had been all in that direction for some
time, he was not prepared to find himself actually eager to measure
strength with quite so common a man as this ruffian. In a moment all the
windows in the neighborhood were filled with people, and the roofs also.
The men squared off, and the fight began. But Allen stood no chance
whatever, against the young Englishman. Neither in muscle nor in science
was he his equal. He measured his length on the tin time and again; in
fact, as fast as he could get up he went down again, and the applause
was kept up in liberal fashion from all the neighborhood around.
Finally, Allen had to be helped up. Then Tracy declined to punish him
further and the fight was at an end. Allen was carried off by some of
his friends in a very much humbled condition, his face black and blue
and bleeding, and Tracy was at once surrounded by the young fellows, who
congratulated him, and told him that he had done the whole house a
service, and that from this out Mr. Allen would be a little more
particular about how he handled slights and insults and maltreatment
around amongst the boarders.</p>
<p>Tracy was a hero now, and exceedingly popular. Perhaps nobody had
ever been quite so popular on that upper floor before. But if being
discountenanced by these young fellows had been hard to bear, their
lavish commendations and approval and hero-worship was harder still to
endure. He felt degraded, but he did not allow himself to analyze the
reasons why, too closely. He was content to satisfy himself with the
suggestion that he looked upon himself as degraded by the public
spectacle which he had made of himself, fighting on a tin roof, for the
delectation of everybody a block or two around. But he wasn’t entirely
satisfied with that explanation of it. Once he went a little too far and
wrote in his diary that his case was worse than that of the prodigal
son. He said the prodigal son merely fed swine, he didn’t have to chum
with them. But he struck that out, and said “All men are equal. I will
not disown my principles. These men are as good as I am.“</p>
<p>Tracy was become popular on the lower floors also. Everybody was
grateful for Allen’s reduction to the ranks, and for his transformation
from a doer of outrages to a mere threatener of them. The young girls,
of whom there were half a dozen, showed many attentions to Tracy,
particularly that boarding house pet Hattie, the landlady’s daughter.
She said to him, very sweetly,</p>
<p>“I think you’re ever so nice.“</p>
<p>And when he said, “I’m glad you think so, Miss Hattie,“ she said,
still more sweetly,</p>
<p>“Don’t call me Miss Hattie–call me Puss.“</p>
<p>Ah, here was promotion! He had struck the summit. There were no
higher heights to climb in that boarding house. His popularity was
complete.</p>
<p>In the presence of people, Tracy showed a tranquil outside, but his
heart was being eaten out of him by distress and despair.</p>
<p>In a little while he should be out of money, and then what should he
do? He wished, now, that he had borrowed a little more liberally from
that stranger’s store. He found it impossible to sleep. A single
torturing, terrifying thought went racking round and round in his head,
wearing a groove in his brain: What should he do–What was to become of
him? And along with it began to intrude a something presently which was
very like a wish that he had not joined the great and noble ranks of
martyrdom, but had stayed at home and been content to be merely an earl
and nothing better, with nothing more to do in this world of a useful
sort than an earl finds to do. But he smothered that part of his thought
as well as he could; he made every effort to drive it away, and with
fair keep it from intruding a little success, but he couldn’t now and
then, and when it intruded it came suddenly and nipped him like a bite,
a sting, a burn. He recognized that thought by the peculiar sharpness of
its pang. The others were painful enough, but that one cut to the quick
when it calm. Night after night he lay tossing to the music of the
hideous snoring of the honest bread-winners until two and three o’clock
in the morning, then got up and took refuge on the roof, where he
sometimes got a nap and sometimes failed entirely. His appetite was
leaving him and the zest of life was going along with it. Finally, owe
day, being near the imminent verge of total discouragement, he said to
himself–and took occasion to blush privately when he said it, “If my
father knew what my American name is,–he–well, my duty to my father
rather requires that I furnish him my name. I have no right to make his
days and nights unhappy, I can do enough unhappiness for the family all
by myself. Really he ought to know what my American name is.“ He thought
over it a while and framed a cablegram in his mind to this effect:</p>
<p>“My American name is Howard Tracy.“</p>
<p>That wouldn’t be suggesting anything. His father could understand
that as he chose, and doubtless he would understand it as it was meant,
as a dutiful and affectionate desire on the part of a son to make his
old father happy for a moment. Continuing his train of thought, Tracy
said to himself, “Ah, but if he should cable me to come home!
I–I–couldn’t do that–I mustn’t do that. I’ve started out on a mission,
and I mustn’t turn my back on it in cowardice. No, no, I couldn’t go
home, at–at– least I shouldn’t want to go home.“ After a reflective
pause: “Well, maybe–perhaps–it would be my duty to go in the
circumstances; he’s very old and he does need me by him to stay his
footsteps down the long hill that inclines westward toward the sunset of
his life. Well, I’ll think about that. Yes, of course it wouldn’t be
right to stay here. If I– well, perhaps I could just drop him a line and
put it off a little while and satisfy him in that way. It would be–well,
it would mar everything to have him require me to come instantly.“
Another reflective pause– then: “And yet if he should do that I don’t
know but–oh, dear me–home! how good it sounds! and a body is excusable
for wanting to see his home again, now and then, anyway.“</p>
<p>He went to one of the telegraph offices in the avenue and got the
first end of what Barrow called the “usual Washington courtesy,“ where
“they treat you as a tramp until they find out you’re a congressman, and
then they slobber all over you.“ There was a boy of seventeen on duty
there, tying his shoe. He had his foot on a chair and his back turned
towards the wicket. He glanced over his shoulder, took Tracy’s measure,
turned back, and went on tying his shoe. Tracy finished writing his
telegram and waited, still waited, and still waited, for that
performance to finish, but there didn’t seem to be any finish to it; so
finally Tracy said:</p>
<p>“Can’t you take my telegram?“</p>
<p>The youth looked over his shoulder and said, by his manner, not his
words:</p>
<p>“Don’t you think you could wait a minute, if you tried?“</p>
<p>However, he got the shoe tied at last, and came and took the
telegram, glanced over it, then looked up surprised, at Tracy. There was
something in his look that bordered upon respect, almost reverence, it
seemed to Tracy, although he had been so long without anything of this
kind he was not sure that he knew the signs of it.</p>
<p>The boy read the address aloud, with pleased expression in face and
voice.</p>
<p>“The Earl of Rossmore! Cracky! Do you know him?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Is that so! Does he know you?“</p>
<p>“Well–yes.“</p>
<p>“Well, I swear! Will he answer you?“</p>
<p>“I think he will.“</p>
<p>“Will he though? Where’ll you have it sent?“</p>
<p>“Oh, nowhere. I’ll call here and get it. When shall I call?“</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know–I’ll send it to you. Where shall I send it? Give me
your address; I’ll send it to you soon’s it comes.“</p>
<p>But Tracy didn’t propose to do this. He had acquired the boy’s
admiration and deferential respect, and he wasn’t willing to throw these
precious things away, a result sure to follow if he should give the
address of that boarding house. So he said again that he would call and
get the telegram, and went his way.</p>
<p>He idled along, reflecting. He said to himself, “There is something
pleasant about being respected. I have acquired the respect of Mr. Allen
and some of those others, and almost the deference of some of them on
pure merit, for having thrashed Allen. While their respect and their
deference–if it is deference–is pleasant, a deference based upon a sham,
a shadow, does really seem pleasanter still. It’s no real merit to be in
correspondence with an earl, and yet after all, that boy makes me feel
as if there was.“</p>
<p>The cablegram was actually gone home! the thought of it gave him an
immense uplift. He walked with a lighter tread. His heart was full of
happiness. He threw aside all hesitances and confessed to himself that
he was glad through and through that he was going to give up this
experiment and go back to his home again. His eagerness to get his
father’s answer began to grow, now, and it grew with marvelous celerity,
after it began. He waited an hour, walking about, putting in his time as
well as he could, but interested in nothing that came under his eye, and
at last he presented himself at the office again and asked if any answer
had come yet. The boy said,</p>
<p>“No, no answer yet,“ then glanced at the clock and added, “I don’t
think it’s likely you’ll get one to-day.“</p>
<p>“Why not?“</p>
<p>“Well, you see it’s getting pretty late. You can’t always tell where
’bouts a man is when he’s on the other side, and you can’t always find
him just the minute you want him, and you see it’s getting about six
o’clock now, and over there it’s pretty late at night.“</p>
<p>“Why yes,“ said Tracy, “I hadn’t thought of that.“</p>
<p>“Yes, pretty late, now, half past ten or eleven. Oh yes, you probably
won’t get any answer to-night.“</p>
