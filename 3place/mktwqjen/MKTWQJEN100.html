<h4 id="chapter-xxxiv.">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h4>
<p>The mountains are very high and steep about Carson, Eagle and Washoe
Valleys–very high and very steep, and so when the snow gets to melting
off fast in the Spring and the warm surface-earth begins to moisten and
soften, the disastrous land-slides commence. The reader cannot know what
a land-slide is, unless he has lived in that country and seen the whole
side of a mountain taken off some fine morning and deposited down in the
valley, leaving a vast, treeless, unsightly scar upon the mountain’s
front to keep the circumstance fresh in his memory all the years that he
may go on living within seventy miles of that place.</p>
<p>General Buncombe was shipped out to Nevada in the invoice of
Territorial officers, to be United States Attorney. He considered
himself a lawyer of parts, and he very much wanted an opportunity to
manifest it–partly for the pure gratification of it and partly because
his salary was Territorially meagre (which is a strong expression). Now
the older citizens of a new territory look down upon the rest of the
world with a calm, benevolent compassion, as long as it keeps out of the
way–when it gets in the way they snub it. Sometimes this latter takes
the shape of a practical joke.</p>
<p>One morning Dick Hyde rode furiously up to General Buncombe’s door in
Carson city and rushed into his presence without stopping to tie his
horse. He seemed much excited. He told the General that he wanted him to
conduct a suit for him and would pay him five hundred dollars if he
achieved a victory. And then, with violent gestures and a world of
profanity, he poured out his grief. He said it was pretty well known
that for some years he had been farming (or ranching as the more
customary term is) in Washoe District, and making a successful thing of
it, and furthermore it was known that his ranch was situated just in the
edge of the valley, and that Tom Morgan owned a ranch immediately above
it on the mountain side.</p>
<p>And now the trouble was, that one of those hated and dreaded
land-slides had come and slid Morgan’s ranch, fences, cabins, cattle,
barns and everything down on top of his ranch and exactly covered up
every single vestige of his property, to a depth of about thirty-eight
feet. Morgan was in possession and refused to vacate the premises–said
he was occupying his own cabin and not interfering with anybody
else’s–and said the cabin was standing on the same dirt and same ranch
it had always stood on, and he would like to see anybody make him
vacate.</p>
<p>“And when I reminded him,“ said Hyde, weeping, “that it was on top of
my ranch and that he was trespassing, he had the infernal meanness to
ask me why didn’t I stay on my ranch and hold possession when I see him
a-coming! Why didn’t I stay on it, the blathering lunatic–by George,
when I heard that racket and looked up that hill it was just like the
whole world was a-ripping and a-tearing down that mountain side
–splinters, and cord-wood, thunder and lightning, hail and snow, odds
and ends of hay stacks, and awful clouds of dust!–trees going end over
end in the air, rocks as big as a house jumping ’bout a thousand feet
high and busting into ten million pieces, cattle turned inside out and
a-coming head on with their tails hanging out between their teeth!–and
in the midst of all that wrack and destruction sot that cussed Morgan on
his gate-post, a-wondering why I didn’t stay and hold possession! Laws
bless me, I just took one glimpse, General, and lit out’n the county in
three jumps exactly.</p>
<p>“But what grinds me is that that Morgan hangs on there and won’t move
off’n that ranch–says it’s his’n and he’s going to keep it–likes it
better’n he did when it was higher up the hill. Mad! Well, I’ve been so
mad for two days I couldn’t find my way to town–been wandering around in
the brush in a starving condition–got anything here to drink, General?
But I’m here now, and I’m a-going to law. You hear me!“</p>
<p>Never in all the world, perhaps, were a man’s feelings so outraged as
were the General’s. He said he had never heard of such high-handed
conduct in all his life as this Morgan’s. And he said there was no use
in going to law–Morgan had no shadow of right to remain where he was
–nobody in the wide world would uphold him in it, and no lawyer would
take his case and no judge listen to it. Hyde said that right there was
where he was mistaken–everybody in town sustained Morgan; Hal Brayton, a
very smart lawyer, had taken his case; the courts being in vacation, it
was to be tried before a referee, and ex-Governor Roop had already been
appointed to that office and would open his court in a large public hall
near the hotel at two that afternoon.</p>
<p>The General was amazed. He said he had suspected before that the
people of that Territory were fools, and now he knew it. But he said
rest easy, rest easy and collect the witnesses, for the victory was just
as certain as if the conflict were already over. Hyde wiped away his
tears and left.</p>
<p>At two in the afternoon referee Roop’s Court opened and Roop appeared
throned among his sheriffs, the witnesses, and spectators, and wearing
upon his face a solemnity so awe-inspiring that some of his
fellow-conspirators had misgivings that maybe he had not comprehended,
after all, that this was merely a joke. An unearthly stillness
prevailed, for at the slightest noise the judge uttered sternly the
command:</p>
<p>“Order in the Court!“</p>
<p>And the sheriffs promptly echoed it. Presently the General elbowed
his way through the crowd of spectators, with his arms full of
law-books, and on his ears fell an order from the judge which was the
first respectful recognition of his high official dignity that had ever
saluted them, and it trickled pleasantly through his whole system:</p>
<p>“Way for the United States Attorney!“</p>
<p>The witnesses were called–legislators, high government officers,
ranchmen, miners, Indians, Chinamen, negroes. Three fourths of them were
called by the defendant Morgan, but no matter, their testimony
invariably went in favor of the plaintiff Hyde. Each new witness only
added new testimony to the absurdity of a man’s claiming to own another
man’s property because his farm had slid down on top of it. Then the
Morgan lawyers made their speeches, and seemed to make singularly weak
ones –they did really nothing to help the Morgan cause. And now the
General, with exultation in his face, got up and made an impassioned
effort; he pounded the table, he banged the law-books, he shouted, and
roared, and howled, he quoted from everything and everybody, poetry,
sarcasm, statistics, history, pathos, bathos, blasphemy, and wound up
with a grand war-whoop for free speech, freedom of the press, free
schools, the Glorious Bird of America and the principles of eternal
justice! [Applause.]</p>
<p>When the General sat down, he did it with the conviction that if
there was anything in good strong testimony, a great speech and
believing and admiring countenances all around, Mr. Morgan’s case was
killed. Ex-Governor Roop leant his head upon his hand for some minutes,
thinking, and the still audience waited for his decision. Then he got up
and stood erect, with bended head, and thought again. Then he walked the
floor with long, deliberate strides, his chin in his hand, and still the
audience waited. At last he returned to his throne, seated himself, and
began impressively:</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, I feel the great responsibility that rests upon me this
day. This is no ordinary case. On the contrary it is plain that it is
the most solemn and awful that ever man was called upon to decide.
Gentlemen, I have listened attentively to the evidence, and have
perceived that the weight of it, the overwhelming weight of it, is in
favor of the plaintiff Hyde. I have listened also to the remarks of
counsel, with high interest–and especially will I commend the masterly
and irrefutable logic of the distinguished gentleman who represents the
plaintiff. But gentlemen, let us beware how we allow mere human
testimony, human ingenuity in argument and human ideas of equity, to
influence us at a moment so solemn as this. Gentlemen, it ill becomes
us, worms as we are, to meddle with the decrees of Heaven. It is plain
to me that Heaven, in its inscrutable wisdom, has seen fit to move this
defendant’s ranch for a purpose. We are but creatures, and we must
submit. If Heaven has chosen to favor the defendant Morgan in this
marked and wonderful manner; and if Heaven, dissatisfied with the
position of the Morgan ranch upon the mountain side, has chosen to
remove it to a position more eligible and more advantageous for its
owner, it ill becomes us, insects as we are, to question the legality of
the act or inquire into the reasons that prompted it. No–Heaven created
the ranches and it is Heaven’s prerogative to rearrange them, to
experiment with them around at its pleasure. It is for us to submit,
without repining.</p>
<p>“I warn you that this thing which has happened is a thing with which
the sacrilegious hands and brains and tongues of men must not meddle.
Gentlemen, it is the verdict of this court that the plaintiff, Richard
Hyde, has been deprived of his ranch by the visitation of God! And from
this decision there is no appeal.“</p>
<p>Buncombe seized his cargo of law-books and plunged out of the
court-room frantic with indignation. He pronounced Roop to be a
miraculous fool, an inspired idiot. In all good faith he returned at
night and remonstrated with Roop upon his extravagant decision, and
implored him to walk the floor and think for half an hour, and see if he
could not figure out some sort of modification of the verdict. Roop
yielded at last and got up to walk. He walked two hours and a half, and
at last his face lit up happily and he told Buncombe it had occurred to
him that the ranch underneath the new Morgan ranch still belonged to
Hyde, that his title to the ground was just as good as it had ever been,
and therefore he was of opinion that Hyde had a right to dig it out from
under there and–</p>
<p>The General never waited to hear the end of it. He was always an
impatient and irascible man, that way. At the end of two months the fact
that he had been played upon with a joke had managed to bore itself,
like another Hoosac Tunnel, through the solid adamant of his
understanding.</p>
