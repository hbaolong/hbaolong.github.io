<h4 id="chapter-li.">CHAPTER LI.</h4>
<p>Vice flourished luxuriantly during the hey-day of our “flush times.“
The saloons were overburdened with custom; so were the police courts,
the gambling dens, the brothels and the jails–unfailing signs of high
prosperity in a mining region–in any region for that matter. Is it not
so? A crowded police court docket is the surest of all signs that trade
is brisk and money plenty. Still, there is one other sign; it comes
last, but when it does come it establishes beyond cavil that the “flush
times“ are at the flood. This is the birth of the “literary“ paper. The
Weekly Occidental, “devoted to literature,“ made its appearance in
Virginia. All the literary people were engaged to write for it. Mr. F.
was to edit it. He was a felicitous skirmisher with a pen, and a man who
could say happy things in a crisp, neat way. Once, while editor of the
Union, he had disposed of a labored, incoherent, two-column attack made
upon him by a contemporary, with a single line, which, at first glance,
seemed to contain a solemn and tremendous compliment–viz.: “THE LOGIC OF
OUR ADVERSARY RESEMBLES THE PEACE OF GOD,“–and left it to the reader’s
memory and after-thought to invest the remark with another and “more
different“ meaning by supplying for himself and at his own leisure the
rest of the Scripture–“in that it passeth understanding.“ He once said
of a little, half-starved, wayside community that had no subsistence
except what they could get by preying upon chance passengers who stopped
over with them a day when traveling by the overland stage, that in their
Church service they had altered the Lord’s Prayer to read: “Give us this
day our daily stranger!“</p>
<p>We expected great things of the Occidental. Of course it could not
get along without an original novel, and so we made arrangements to hurl
into the work the full strength of the company. Mrs. F. was an able
romancist of the ineffable school–I know no other name to apply to a
school whose heroes are all dainty and all perfect. She wrote the
opening chapter, and introduced a lovely blonde simpleton who talked
nothing but pearls and poetry and who was virtuous to the verge of
eccentricity. She also introduced a young French Duke of aggravated
refinement, in love with the blonde. Mr. F. followed next week, with a
brilliant lawyer who set about getting the Duke’s estates into trouble,
and a sparkling young lady of high society who fell to fascinating the
Duke and impairing the appetite of the blonde. Mr. D., a dark and bloody
editor of one of the dailies, followed Mr. F., the third week,
introducing a mysterious Roscicrucian who transmuted metals, held
consultations with the devil in a cave at dead of night, and cast the
horoscope of the several heroes and heroines in such a way as to provide
plenty of trouble for their future careers and breed a solemn and awful
public interest in the novel. He also introduced a cloaked and masked
melodramatic miscreant, put him on a salary and set him on the midnight
track of the Duke with a poisoned dagger. He also created an Irish
coachman with a rich brogue and placed him in the service of the
society-young-lady with an ulterior mission to carry billet-doux to the
Duke.</p>
<p>About this time there arrived in Virginia a dissolute stranger with a
literary turn of mind–rather seedy he was, but very quiet and
unassuming; almost diffident, indeed. He was so gentle, and his manners
were so pleasing and kindly, whether he was sober or intoxicated, that
he made friends of all who came in contact with him. He applied for
literary work, offered conclusive evidence that he wielded an easy and
practiced pen, and so Mr. F. engaged him at once to help write the
novel. His chapter was to follow Mr. D.’s, and mine was to come next.
Now what does this fellow do but go off and get drunk and then proceed
to his quarters and set to work with his imagination in a state of
chaos, and that chaos in a condition of extravagant activity. The result
may be guessed. He scanned the chapters of his predecessors, found
plenty of heroes and heroines already created, and was satisfied with
them; he decided to introduce no more; with all the confidence that
whisky inspires and all the easy complacency it gives to its servant, he
then launched himself lovingly into his work: he married the coachman to
the society-young-lady for the sake of the scandal; married the Duke to
the blonde’s stepmother, for the sake of the sensation; stopped the
desperado’s salary; created a misunderstanding between the devil and the
Roscicrucian; threw the Duke’s property into the wicked lawyer’s hands;
made the lawyer’s upbraiding conscience drive him to drink, thence to
delirium tremens, thence to suicide; broke the coachman’s neck; let his
widow succumb to contumely, neglect, poverty and consumption; caused the
blonde to drown herself, leaving her clothes on the bank with the
customary note pinned to them forgiving the Duke and hoping he would be
happy; revealed to the Duke, by means of the usual strawberry mark on
left arm, that he had married his own long-lost mother and destroyed his
long-lost sister; instituted the proper and necessary suicide of the
Duke and the Duchess in order to compass poetical justice; opened the
earth and let the Roscicrucian through, accompanied with the accustomed
smoke and thunder and smell of brimstone, and finished with the promise
that in the next chapter, after holding a general inquest, he would take
up the surviving character of the novel and tell what became of the
devil! It read with singular smoothness, and with a “dead“ earnestness
that was funny enough to suffocate a body. But there was war when it
came in. The other novelists were furious. The mild stranger, not yet
more than half sober, stood there, under a scathing fire of
vituperation, meek and bewildered, looking from one to another of his
assailants, and wondering what he could have done to invoke such a
storm. When a lull came at last, he said his say gently and
appealingly–said he did not rightly remember what he had written, but
was sure he had tried to do the best he could, and knew his object had
been to make the novel not only pleasant and plausible but instructive
and—-</p>
<p>The bombardment began again. The novelists assailed his ill-chosen
adjectives and demolished them with a storm of denunciation and
ridicule. And so the siege went on. Every time the stranger tried to
appease the enemy he only made matters worse. Finally he offered to
rewrite the chapter. This arrested hostilities. The indignation
gradually quieted down, peace reigned again and the sufferer retired in
safety and got him to his own citadel.</p>
<p>But on the way thither the evil angel tempted him and he got drunk
again. And again his imagination went mad. He led the heroes and
heroines a wilder dance than ever; and yet all through it ran that same
convincing air of honesty and earnestness that had marked his first
work. He got the characters into the most extraordinary situations, put
them through the most surprising performances, and made them talk the
strangest talk! But the chapter cannot be described. It was
symmetrically crazy; it was artistically absurd; and it had explanatory
footnotes that were fully as curious as the text. I remember one of the
“situations,“ and will offer it as an example of the whole. He altered
the character of the brilliant lawyer, and made him a great-hearted,
splendid fellow; gave him fame and riches, and set his age at
thirty-three years. Then he made the blonde discover, through the help
of the Roscicrucian and the melodramatic miscreant, that while the Duke
loved her money ardently and wanted it, he secretly felt a sort of
leaning toward the society-young-lady. Stung to the quick, she tore her
affections from him and bestowed them with tenfold power upon the
lawyer, who responded with consuming zeal. But the parents would none of
it. What they wanted in the family was a Duke; and a Duke they were
determined to have; though they confessed that next to the Duke the
lawyer had their preference. Necessarily the blonde now went into a
decline. The parents were alarmed. They pleaded with her to marry the
Duke, but she steadfastly refused, and pined on. Then they laid a plan.
They told her to wait a year and a day, and if at the end of that time
she still felt that she could not marry the Duke, she might marry the
lawyer with their full consent. The result was as they had foreseen:
gladness came again, and the flush of returning health. Then the parents
took the next step in their scheme. They had the family physician
recommend a long sea voyage and much land travel for the thorough
restoration of the blonde’s strength; and they invited the Duke to be of
the party. They judged that the Duke’s constant presence and the
lawyer’s protracted absence would do the rest–for they did not invite
the lawyer.</p>
<p>So they set sail in a steamer for America–and the third day out, when
their sea-sickness called truce and permitted them to take their first
meal at the public table, behold there sat the lawyer! The Duke and
party made the best of an awkward situation; the voyage progressed, and
the vessel neared America.</p>
<p>But, by and by, two hundred miles off New Bedford, the ship took
fire; she burned to the water’s edge; of all her crew and passengers,
only thirty were saved. They floated about the sea half an afternoon and
all night long. Among them were our friends. The lawyer, by superhuman
exertions, had saved the blonde and her parents, swimming back and forth
two hundred yards and bringing one each time–(the girl first). The Duke
had saved himself. In the morning two whale ships arrived on the scene
and sent their boats. The weather was stormy and the embarkation was
attended with much confusion and excitement. The lawyer did his duty
like a man; helped his exhausted and insensible blonde, her parents and
some others into a boat (the Duke helped himself in); then a child fell
overboard at the other end of the raft and the lawyer rushed thither and
helped half a dozen people fish it out, under the stimulus of its
mother’s screams. Then he ran back–a few seconds too late–the blonde’s
boat was under way. So he had to take the other boat, and go to the
other ship. The storm increased and drove the vessels out of sight of
each other–drove them whither it would.</p>
<p>When it calmed, at the end of three days, the blonde’s ship was seven
hundred miles north of Boston and the other about seven hundred south of
that port. The blonde’s captain was bound on a whaling cruise in the
North Atlantic and could not go back such a distance or make a port
without orders; such being nautical law. The lawyer’s captain was to
cruise in the North Pacific, and he could not go back or make a port
without orders. All the lawyer’s money and baggage were in the blonde’s
boat and went to the blonde’s ship–so his captain made him work his
passage as a common sailor. When both ships had been cruising nearly a
year, the one was off the coast of Greenland and the other in Behring’s
Strait. The blonde had long ago been well-nigh persuaded that her lawyer
had been washed overboard and lost just before the whale ships reached
the raft, and now, under the pleadings of her parents and the Duke she
was at last beginning to nerve herself for the doom of the covenant, and
prepare for the hated marriage.</p>
<p>But she would not yield a day before the date set. The weeks dragged
on, the time narrowed, orders were given to deck the ship for the
wedding–a wedding at sea among icebergs and walruses. Five days more and
all would be over. So the blonde reflected, with a sigh and a tear. Oh
where was her true love–and why, why did he not come and save her? At
that moment he was lifting his harpoon to strike a whale in Behring’s
Strait, five thousand miles away, by the way of the Arctic Ocean, or
twenty thousand by the way of the Horn–that was the reason. He struck,
but not with perfect aim–his foot slipped and he fell in the whale’s
mouth and went down his throat. He was insensible five days. Then he
came to himself and heard voices; daylight was streaming through a hole
cut in the whale’s roof. He climbed out and astonished the sailors who
were hoisting blubber up a ship’s side. He recognized the vessel, flew
aboard, surprised the wedding party at the altar and exclaimed:</p>
<p>“Stop the proceedings–I’m here! Come to my arms, my own!“</p>
<p>There were foot-notes to this extravagant piece of literature wherein
the author endeavored to show that the whole thing was within the
possibilities; he said he got the incident of the whale traveling from
Behring’s Strait to the coast of Greenland, five thousand miles in five
days, through the Arctic Ocean, from Charles Reade’s “Love Me Little
Love Me Long,“ and considered that that established the fact that the
thing could be done; and he instanced Jonah’s adventure as proof that a
man could live in a whale’s belly, and added that if a preacher could
stand it three days a lawyer could surely stand it five!</p>
<p>There was a fiercer storm than ever in the editorial sanctum now, and
the stranger was peremptorily discharged, and his manuscript flung at
his head. But he had already delayed things so much that there was not
time for some one else to rewrite the chapter, and so the paper came out
without any novel in it. It was but a feeble, struggling, stupid
journal, and the absence of the novel probably shook public confidence;
at any rate, before the first side of the next issue went to press, the
Weekly Occidental died as peacefully as an infant.</p>
<p>An effort was made to resurrect it, with the proposed advantage of a
telling new title, and Mr. F. said that The Phenix would be just the
name for it, because it would give the idea of a resurrection from its
dead ashes in a new and undreamed of condition of splendor; but some
low-priced smarty on one of the dailies suggested that we call it the
Lazarus; and inasmuch as the people were not profound in Scriptural
matters but thought the resurrected Lazarus and the dilapidated
mendicant that begged in the rich man’s gateway were one and the same
person, the name became the laughing stock of the town, and killed the
paper for good and all.</p>
<p>I was sorry enough, for I was very proud of being connected with a
literary paper–prouder than I have ever been of anything since, perhaps.
I had written some rhymes for it–poetry I considered it–and it was a
great grief to me that the production was on the “first side“ of the
issue that was not completed, and hence did not see the light. But time
brings its revenges–I can put it in here; it will answer in place of a
tear dropped to the memory of the lost Occidental. The idea (not the
chief idea, but the vehicle that bears it) was probably suggested by the
old song called “The Raging Canal,“ but I cannot remember now. I do
remember, though, that at that time I thought my doggerel was one of the
ablest poems of the age:</p>
<p>THE AGED PILOT MAN.</p>
<p>On the Erie Canal, it was, All on a summer’s day, I sailed forth with
my parents Far away to Albany.</p>
<p>From out the clouds at noon that day There came a dreadful storm,
That piled the billows high about, And filled us with alarm.</p>
<p>A man came rushing from a house, Saying, “Snub up your boat I pray,
[The customary canal technicality for “tie up.“] Snub up your boat, snub
up, alas, Snub up while yet you may.“</p>
<p>Our captain cast one glance astern, Then forward glanced he, And
said, “My wife and little ones I never more shall see.“</p>
<p>Said Dollinger the pilot man, In noble words, but few, –“Fear not,
but lean on Dollinger, And he will fetch you through.“</p>
<p>The boat drove on, the frightened mules Tore through the rain and
wind, And bravely still, in danger’s post, The whip-boy strode
behind.</p>
<p>“Come ’board, come ’board,“ the captain cried, “Nor tempt so wild a
storm;“ But still the raging mules advanced, And still the boy strode
on.</p>
<p>Then said the captain to us all, “Alas, ’tis plain to me, The greater
danger is not there, But here upon the sea.</p>
<p>“So let us strive, while life remains, To save all souls on board,
And then if die at last we must, Let . . . . I cannot speak the
word!“</p>
<p>Said Dollinger the pilot man, Tow’ring above the crew, “Fear not, but
trust in Dollinger, And he will fetch you through.“</p>
<p>“Low bridge! low bridge!“ all heads went down, The laboring bark sped
on; A mill we passed, we passed church, Hamlets, and fields of corn; And
all the world came out to see, And chased along the shore Crying, “Alas,
alas, the sheeted rain, The wind, the tempest’s roar! Alas, the gallant
ship and crew, Can nothing help them more?“</p>
<p>And from our deck sad eyes looked out Across the stormy scene: The
tossing wake of billows aft, The bending forests green, The chickens
sheltered under carts In lee of barn the cows, The skurrying swine with
straw in mouth, The wild spray from our bows!</p>
<p>“She balances! She wavers! Now let her go about! If she misses stays
and broaches to, We’re all“–then with a shout, “Huray! huray! Avast!
belay! Take in more sail! Lord, what a gale! Ho, boy, haul taut on the
hind mule’s tail!“ “Ho! lighten ship! ho! man the pump! Ho, hostler,
heave the lead!“</p>
<p>“A quarter-three!–’tis shoaling fast! Three feet large!–t-h-r-e-e
feet! –Three feet scant!“ I cried in fright “Oh, is there no
retreat?“</p>
<p>Said Dollinger, the pilot man, As on the vessel flew, “Fear not, but
trust in Dollinger, And he will fetch you through.“</p>
<p>A panic struck the bravest hearts, The boldest cheek turned pale; For
plain to all, this shoaling said A leak had burst the ditch’s bed! And,
straight as bolt from crossbow sped, Our ship swept on, with shoaling
lead, Before the fearful gale!</p>
<p>“Sever the tow-line! Cripple the mules!“ Too late! There comes a
shock! Another length, and the fated craft Would have swum in the saving
lock!</p>
<p>Then gathered together the shipwrecked crew And took one last
embrace, While sorrowful tears from despairing eyes Ran down each
hopeless face; And some did think of their little ones Whom they never
more might see, And others of waiting wives at home, And mothers that
grieved would be.</p>
<p>But of all the children of misery there On that poor sinking frame,
But one spake words of hope and faith, And I worshipped as they came:
Said Dollinger the pilot man, –(O brave heart, strong and true!) –“Fear
not, but trust in Dollinger, For he will fetch you through.“</p>
<p>Lo! scarce the words have passed his lips The dauntless prophet
say’th, When every soul about him seeth A wonder crown his faith!</p>
<p>“And count ye all, both great and small, As numbered with the dead:
For mariner for forty year, On Erie, boy and man, I never yet saw such a
storm, Or one’t with it began!“</p>
<p>So overboard a keg of nails And anvils three we threw, Likewise four
bales of gunny-sacks, Two hundred pounds of glue, Two sacks of corn,
four ditto wheat, A box of books, a cow, A violin, Lord Byron’s works, A
rip-saw and a sow.</p>
<p>A curve! a curve! the dangers grow!
“Labbord!–stabbord!–s-t-e-a-d-y!–so! –Hard-a-port, Dol!–hellum-a-lee!
Haw the head mule!–the aft one gee! Luff!–bring her to the wind!“</p>
<p>For straight a farmer brought a plank, –(Mysteriously inspired) –And
laying it unto the ship, In silent awe retired.</p>
<p>Then every sufferer stood amazed That pilot man before; A moment
stood. Then wondering turned, And speechless walked ashore.</p>
