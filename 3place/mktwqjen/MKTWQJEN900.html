Nos. 8, 9, and 10 were not of special importance. In No. 10 he gives
some advice to San Francisco as to the treatment of whalers. He
says:</h4>
<p>“If I were going to advise San Francisco as to the best strategy to
employ in order to secure the whaling trade, I should say, ‘Cripple your
facilities for “pulling“ sea captains on any pretence that sailors can
trump up, and show the whaler a little more consideration when he is in
port.’“</p>
<p>In No. 11, May 24th, he tells of a trip to the Kalehi Valley, and
through historic points. At one place he looked from a precipice over
which old Kamehameha I. drove the army of Oahu, three-quarters of a
century before.</p>
<p>The vegetation and glory of the tropics attracted him. “In one open
spot a vine of a species unknown had taken possession of two tall dead
stumps, and wound around and about them, and swung out from their tops,
and twined their meeting tendrils together into a faultless arch. Man,
with all his art, could not improve upon its symmetry.“</p>
<p>He saw Sam Brannan’s palace, “The Bungalow,“ built by one Shillaber
of San Francisco at a cost of from thirty to forty thousand dollars. In
its day it had outshone its regal neighbor, the palace of the king, but
had fallen to decay after passing into Brannan’s hands, and had become a
picturesque Theban ruin by the time of Mark Twain’s visit.</p>
<p>In No. 12, June 20th (written May 23d), he tells of the Hawaiian
Legislature, and of his trip to the island of Maui, where, as he says,
he never spent so pleasant a month before, or bade any place good-by so
regretfully.</p>
<p>In No. 13 he continues the Legislature, and gives this picture of
Minister Harris: “He is six feet high, bony and rather slender; long,
ungainly arms; stands so straight he leans back a little; has small side
whiskers; his head long, up and down; he has no command of language or
ideas; oratory all show and pretence; a big washing and a small
hang-out; weak, insipid, and a damn fool in general.“</p>
<p>In No. 14, June 22d, published July 16th, he tells of the death and
burial ceremonies of the Princess Victoria K. K., and, what was to be of
more importance to him, of the arrival of Anson Burlingame, U. S.
Minister to China, and Gen. Van Valkenburgh, U. S. Minister to Japan.
They were to stay ten or fourteen days, he said, but an effort would be
made to have them stay over July 4th.</p>
<p>Speaking of Burlingame: “Burlingame is a man who could be esteemed,
respected, and popular anywhere, no matter whether he was among
Christians or cannibals.“ Then, in the same letter, comes the great
incident. “A letter arrived here yesterday, giving a meagre account of
the arrival, on the Island of Hawaii, of nineteen poor, starving
wretches, who had been buffeting a stormy sea, in an open boat, for
forty-three days. Their ship, the Hornet, from New York, with a quantity
of kerosene on board had taken fire and burned in Lat. 2d. north, and
Long. 35d. west. When they had been entirely out of provisions for a day
or two, and the cravings of hunger become insufferable, they yielded to
the ship-wrecked mariner’s fearful and awful alternative, and solemnly
drew lots to determine who of their number should die, to furnish food
for his comrades; and then the morning mists lifted, and they saw land.
They are being cared for at Sanpahoe (Not yet corroborated).“</p>
<p>The Hornet disaster was fully told in his letter of June 27th. The
survivors were brought to Honolulu, and with the assistance of the
Burlingame party, Clemens, laid up with saddle boils, was carried on a
stretcher to the hospital, where, aided by Burlingame, he interviewed
the shipwrecked men, securing material for the most important piece of
serious writing he had thus far performed. Letter No. 15 to the Union–of
date June 25th–occupied the most of the first page in the issue of July
19. It was a detailed account of the sufferings of officers and crew, as
given by the third officer and members of the crew.</p>
<p>From letter No. 15:</p>
<p>In the postscript of a letter which I wrote two or three days ago,
and sent by the ship “Live Yankee,“ I gave you the substance of a letter
received here from Hilo, by Walker Allen and Co., informing them that a
boat, containing fifteen men in a helpless and starving condition, had
drifted ashore at Sanpahoe, Island of Hawaii, and that they had belonged
to the clipper ship “Hornet“–Cap. Mitchell, master–had been afloat since
the burning of that vessel, about one hundred miles north of the
equator, on the third of May–forty-three days.</p>
<p>The Third Mate, and ten of the seamen have arrived here, and are now
in the hospital. Cap. Mitchell, one seaman named Antonio Passene, and
two passengers, Samuel and Henry Ferguson, of New York City, eighteen
and twenty-eight years, are still at Hilo, but are expected here within
the week. In the Captain’s modest epitome of the terrible romance you
detect the fine old hero through it. It reads like Grant.</p>
<p>Here follows the whole terrible narrative, which has since been
published in more substantial form, and has been recognized as
literature. It occupied three and a half columns on the front page of
the Union, and, of course, constituted a great beat for that paper–a
fact which they appreciated to the extent of one hundred dollars the
column upon the writer’s return from the islands.</p>
<p>In letters Nos. 14. and 15. he gives further particulars of the month
of mourning for the princess, and funeral ceremonials. He refers to
Burlingame, who was still in the islands. The remaining letters are
unimportant.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian episode in Mark Twain’s life was one of those spots that
seemed to him always filled with sunlight. From beginning to end it had
been a long luminous dream; in the next letter, written on the
homeward-bound ship, becalmed under a cloudless sky, we realize the
fitting end of the experience.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>ON BOARD SHIP Smyrniote, AT SEA, July 30, 1866. DEAR MOTHER AND
SISTER,–I write, now, because I must go hard at work as soon as I get to
San Francisco, and then I shall have no time for other things–though
truth to say I have nothing now to write which will be calculated to
interest you much. We left the, Sandwich Islands eight or ten days–or
twelve days ago–I don’t know which, I have been so hard at work until
today (at least part of each day,) that the time has slipped away almost
unnoticed. The first few days we came at a whooping gait being in the
latitude of the “North-east trades,“ but we soon ran out of them. We
used them as long as they lasted-hundred of miles–and came dead straight
north until exactly abreast of San Francisco precisely straight west of
the city in a bee-line–but a long bee-line, as we were about two
thousand miles at sea-consequently, we are not a hundred yards nearer
San Francisco than you are. And here we lie becalmed on a glassy sea–we
do not move an inch-we throw banana and orange peel overboard and it
lies still on the water by the vessel’s side. Sometimes the ocean is as
dead level as the Mississippi river, and glitters glassily as if
polished–but usually, of course, no matter how calm the weather is, we
roll and surge over the grand ground-swell. We amuse ourselves tying
pieces of tin to the ship’s log and sinking them to see how far we can
distinguish them under water–86 feet was the deepest we could see a
small piece of tin, but a white plate would show about as far down as
the steeple of Dr. Bullard’s church would reach, I guess. The sea is
very dark and blue here.</p>
<p>Ever since we got becalmed–five days–I have been copying the diary of
one of the young Fergusons (the two boys who starved and suffered, with
thirteen others, in an open boat at sea for forty-three days, lately,
after their ship, the “Hornet,“ was burned on the equator.) Both these
boys, and Captain Mitchell, are passengers with us. I am copying the
diary to publish in Harper’s Magazine, if I have time to fix it up
properly when I get to San Francisco.</p>
<p>I suppose, from present appearances,–light winds and calms,–that we
shall be two or three weeks at sea, yet–and I hope so–I am in no hurry
to go to work.</p>
<p>Sunday Morning, Aug. 6. This is rather slow. We still drift, drift,
drift along–at intervals a spanking breeze and then–drift again–hardly
move for half a day. But I enjoy it. We have such snowy moonlight, and
such gorgeous sunsets. And the ship is so easy–even in a gale she rolls
very little, compared to other vessels–and in this calm we could dance
on deck, if we chose. You can walk a crack, so steady is she. Very
different from the Ajax. My trunk used to get loose in the stateroom and
rip and tear around the place as if it had life in it, and I always had
to take my clothes off in bed because I could not stand up and do
it.</p>
<p>There is a ship in sight–the first object we have seen since we left
Honolulu. We are still 1300 or 1400 miles from land and so anything like
this that varies the vast solitude of the ocean makes all hands
light-hearted and cheerful. We think the ship is the “Comet,“ which left
Honolulu several hours before we did. She is about twelve miles away,
and so we cannot see her hull, but the sailors think it is the Comet
because of some peculiarity about her fore-top-gallant sails. We have
watched her all the forenoon.</p>
<p>Afternoon We had preaching on the quarter-deck by Rev. Mr. Rising, of
Virginia City, old friend of mine. Spread a flag on the booby-hatch,
which made a very good pulpit, and then ranged the chairs on either side
against the bulwarks; last Sunday we had the shadow of the mainsail, but
today we were on the opposite tack, close hauled, and had the sun. I am
leader of the choir on this ship, and a sorry lead it is. I hope they
will have a better opinion of our music in Heaven than I have down here.
If they don’t a thunderbolt will come down and knock the vessel
endways.</p>
<p>The other ship is the Comet–she is right abreast three miles away,
sailing on our course–both of us in a dead calm. With the glasses we can
see what we take to be men and women on her decks. I am well acquainted
with nearly all her passengers, and being so close seems right
sociable.</p>
<p>Monday 7–I had just gone to bed a little after midnight when the 2d
mate came and roused up the captain and said “The Comet has come round
and is standing away on the other tack.“ I went up immediately, and so
did all our passengers, without waiting to dress-men, women and
children. There was a perceptible breeze. Pretty soon the other ship
swept down upon us with all her sails set, and made a fine show in the
luminous starlight. She passed within a hundred yards of us, so we could
faintly see persons on her decks. We had two minutes’ chat with each
other, through the medium of hoarse shouting, and then she bore away to
windward.</p>
<p>In the morning she was only a little black peg standing out of the
glassy sea in the distant horizon–an almost invisible mark in the bright
sky. Dead calm. So the ships have stood, all day long–have not moved 100
yards.</p>
<p>Aug. 8–The calm continues. Magnificent weather. The gentlemen have
all turned boys. They play boyish games on the poop and quarter-deck.
For instance: They lay a knife on the fife-rail of the mainmast–stand
off three steps, shut one eye, walk up and strike at it with the
fore-finger; (seldom hit it;) also they lay a knife on the deck and walk
seven or eight steps with eyes close shut, and try to find it. They
kneel–place elbows against knees–extend hands in front along the
deck–place knife against end of fingers–then clasp hands behind back and
bend forward and try to pick up the knife with their teeth and rise up
from knees without rolling over or losing their balance. They tie a
string to the shrouds –stand with back against it walk three steps (eyes
shut)–turn around three times and go and put finger on the string; only
a military man can do it. If you want to know how perfectly ridiculous a
grown man looks performing such absurdities in the presence of ladies,
get one to try it.</p>
<p>Afternoon–The calm is no more. There are three vessels in sight. It
is so sociable to have them hovering about us on this broad waste of
water. It is sunny and pleasant, but blowing hard. Every rag about the
ship is spread to the breeze and she is speeding over the sea like a
bird. There is a large brig right astern of us with all her canvas set
and chasing us at her best. She came up fast while the winds were light,
but now it is hard to tell whether she gains or not. We can see the
people on the forecastle with the glass. The race is exciting. I am
sorry to know that we shall soon have to quit the vessel and go ashore
if she keeps up this speed.</p>
<p>Friday, Aug. 10–We have breezes and calms alternately. The brig is
two miles to three astern, and just stays there. We sail directly
east–this brings the brig, with all her canvas set, almost in the eye of
the sun, when it sets–beautiful. She looks sharply cut and black as a
coal, against a background of fire and in the midst of a sea of
blood.</p>
<p>San Francisco, Aug. 20.–We never saw the Comet again till the 13th,
in the morning, three miles away. At three o’clock that afternoon, 25
days out from Honolulu, both ships entered the Golden Gate of San
Francisco side by side, and 300 yards apart. There was a gale blowing,
and both vessels clapped on every stitch of canvas and swept up through
the channel and past the fortresses at a magnificent gait.</p>
<p>I have been up to Sacramento and squared accounts with the Union.
They paid me a great deal more than they promised me. Yrs aff SAM.</p>
