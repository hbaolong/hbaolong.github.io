<h4 id="chapter-27-some-imported-articles">Chapter 27 Some Imported
Articles</h4>
<p>WE met two steamboats at New Madrid. Two steamboats in sight at once!
an infrequent spectacle now in the lonesome Mississippi. The loneliness
of this solemn, stupendous flood is impressive–and depressing. League
after league, and still league after league, it pours its chocolate tide
along, between its solid forest walls, its almost untenanted shores,
with seldom a sail or a moving object of any kind to disturb the surface
and break the monotony of the blank, watery solitude; and so the day
goes, the night comes, and again the day–and still the same, night after
night and day after day–majestic, unchanging sameness of serenity,
repose, tranquillity, lethargy, vacancy–symbol of eternity, realization
of the heaven pictured by priest and prophet, and longed for by the good
and thoughtless!</p>
<p>Immediately after the war of 1812, tourists began to come to America,
from England; scattering ones at first, then a sort of procession of
them–a procession which kept up its plodding, patient march through the
land during many, many years. Each tourist took notes, and went home and
published a book–a book which was usually calm, truthful, reasonable,
kind; but which seemed just the reverse to our tender-footed
progenitors. A glance at these tourist-books shows us that in certain of
its aspects the Mississippi has undergone no change since those
strangers visited it, but remains to-day about as it was then. The
emotions produced in those foreign breasts by these aspects were not all
formed on one pattern, of course; they HAD to be various, along at
first, because the earlier tourists were obliged to originate their
emotions, whereas in older countries one can always borrow emotions from
one’s predecessors. And, mind you, emotions are among the toughest
things in the world to manufacture out of whole cloth; it is easier to
manufacture seven facts than one emotion. Captain Basil Hall. R.N.,
writing fifty-five years ago, says–</p>
<p>‘Here I caught the first glimpse of the object I had so long wished
to behold, and felt myself amply repaid at that moment for all the
trouble I had experienced in coming so far; and stood looking at the
river flowing past till it was too dark to distinguish anything. But it
was not till I had visited the same spot a dozen times, that I came to a
right comprehension of the grandeur of the scene.’</p>
<p>Following are Mrs. Trollope’s emotions. She is writing a few months
later in the same year, 1827, and is coming in at the mouth of the
Mississippi–</p>
<p>‘The first indication of our approach to land was the appearance of
this mighty river pouring forth its muddy mass of waters, and mingling
with the deep blue of the Mexican Gulf. I never beheld a scene so
utterly desolate as this entrance of the Mississippi. Had Dante seen it,
he might have drawn images of another Borgia from its horrors. One only
object rears itself above the eddying waters; this is the mast of a
vessel long since wrecked in attempting to cross the bar, and it still
stands, a dismal witness of the destruction that has been, and a boding
prophet of that which is to come.’</p>
<p>Emotions of Hon. Charles Augustus Murray (near St. Louis), seven
years later–</p>
<p>‘It is only when you ascend the mighty current for fifty or a hundred
miles, and use the eye of imagination as well as that of nature, that
you begin to understand all his might and majesty. You see him
fertilizing a boundless valley, bearing along in his course the trophies
of his thousand victories over the shattered forest–here carrying away
large masses of soil with all their growth, and there forming islands,
destined at some future period to be the residence of man; and while
indulging in this prospect, it is then time for reflection to suggest
that the current before you has flowed through two or three thousand
miles, and has yet to travel one thousand three hundred more before
reaching its ocean destination.’</p>
<p>Receive, now, the emotions of Captain Marryat, R.N. author of the sea
tales, writing in 1837, three years after Mr. Murray–</p>
<p>‘Never, perhaps, in the records of nations, was there an instance of
a century of such unvarying and unmitigated crime as is to be collected
from the history of the turbulent and blood-stained Mississippi. The
stream itself appears as if appropriate for the deeds which have been
committed. It is not like most rivers, beautiful to the sight, bestowing
fertility in its course; not one that the eye loves to dwell upon as it
sweeps along, nor can you wander upon its banks, or trust yourself
without danger to its stream. It is a furious, rapid, desolating
torrent, loaded with alluvial soil; and few of those who are received
into its waters ever rise again, {footnote [There was a foolish
superstition of some little prevalence in that day, that the Mississippi
would neither buoy up a swimmer, nor permit a drowned person’s body to
rise to the surface.]} or can support themselves long upon its surface
without assistance from some friendly log. It contains the coarsest and
most uneatable of fish, such as the cat-fish and such genus, and as you
descend, its banks are occupied with the fetid alligator, while the
panther basks at its edge in the cane-brakes, almost impervious to man.
Pouring its impetuous waters through wild tracks covered with trees of
little value except for firewood, it sweeps down whole forests in its
course, which disappear in tumultuous confusion, whirled away by the
stream now loaded with the masses of soil which nourished their roots,
often blocking up and changing for a time the channel of the river,
which, as if in anger at its being opposed, inundates and devastates the
whole country round; and as soon as it forces its way through its former
channel, plants in every direction the uprooted monarchs of the forest
(upon whose branches the bird will never again perch, or the raccoon,
the opossum, or the squirrel climb) as traps to the adventurous
navigators of its waters by steam, who, borne down upon these concealed
dangers which pierce through the planks, very often have not time to
steer for and gain the shore before they sink to the bottom. There are
no pleasing associations connected with the great common sewer of the
Western America, which pours out its mud into the Mexican Gulf,
polluting the clear blue sea for many miles beyond its mouth. It is a
river of desolation; and instead of reminding you, like other beautiful
rivers, of an angel which has descended for the benefit of man, you
imagine it a devil, whose energies have been only overcome by the
wonderful power of steam.’</p>
<p>It is pretty crude literature for a man accustomed to handling a pen;
still, as a panorama of the emotions sent weltering through this noted
visitor’s breast by the aspect and traditions of the ‘great common
sewer,’ it has a value. A value, though marred in the matter of
statistics by inaccuracies; for the catfish is a plenty good enough fish
for anybody, and there are no panthers that are ‘impervious to man.’</p>
<p>Later still comes Alexander Mackay, of the Middle Temple, Barrister
at Law, with a better digestion, and no catfish dinner aboard, and feels
as follows–</p>
<p>‘The Mississippi! It was with indescribable emotions that I first
felt myself afloat upon its waters. How often in my schoolboy dreams,
and in my waking visions afterwards, had my imagination pictured to
itself the lordly stream, rolling with tumultuous current through the
boundless region to which it has given its name, and gathering into
itself, in its course to the ocean, the tributary waters of almost every
latitude in the temperate zone! Here it was then in its reality, and I,
at length, steaming against its tide. I looked upon it with that
reverence with which everyone must regard a great feature of external
nature.’</p>
<p>So much for the emotions. The tourists, one and all, remark upon the
deep, brooding loneliness and desolation of the vast river. Captain
Basil Hall, who saw it at flood-stage, says–</p>
<p>‘Sometimes we passed along distances of twenty or thirty miles
without seeing a single habitation. An artist, in search of hints for a
painting of the deluge, would here have found them in abundance.’</p>
<p>The first shall be last, etc. just two hundred years ago, the old
original first and gallantest of all the foreign tourists, pioneer, head
of the procession, ended his weary and tedious discovery-voyage down the
solemn stretches of the great river–La Salle, whose name will last as
long as the river itself shall last. We quote from Mr. Parkman–</p>
<p>‘And now they neared their journey’s end. On the sixth of April, the
river divided itself into three broad channels. La Salle followed that
of the west, and D’Autray that of the east; while Tonty took the middle
passage. As he drifted down the turbid current, between the low and
marshy shores, the brackish water changed to brine, and the breeze grew
fresh with the salt breath of the sea. Then the broad bosom of the great
Gulf opened on his sight, tossing its restless billows, limitless,
voiceless, lonely as when born of chaos, without a sail, without a sign
of life.’</p>
<p>Then, on a spot of solid ground, La Salle reared a column ‘bearing
the arms of France; the Frenchmen were mustered under arms; and while
the New England Indians and their squaws looked on in wondering silence,
they chanted the TE DEUM, THE EXAUDIAT, and the DOMINE SALVUM FAC
REGEM.’</p>
<p>Then, whilst the musketry volleyed and rejoicing shouts burst forth,
the victorious discoverer planted the column, and made proclamation in a
loud voice, taking formal possession of the river and the vast countries
watered by it, in the name of the King. The column bore this
inscription–</p>
<p>LOUIS LE GRAND, ROY DE FRANCE ET DE NAVARRE, REGNE; LE NEUVIEME
AVRIL, 1682.</p>
<p>New Orleans intended to fittingly celebrate, this present year, the
bicentennial anniversary of this illustrious event; but when the time
came, all her energies and surplus money were required in other
directions, for the flood was upon the land then, making havoc and
devastation everywhere.</p>
