<h4 id="chapter-xlii.">CHAPTER XLII.</h4>
<p>THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn’t get no
track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying
nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not
eating anything. And by and by the old man says:</p>
<p>“Did I give you the letter?“</p>
<p>“What letter?“</p>
<p>“The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.“</p>
<p>“No, you didn’t give me no letter.“</p>
<p>“Well, I must a forgot it.“</p>
<p>So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had
laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:</p>
<p>“Why, it’s from St. Petersburg–it’s from Sis.“</p>
<p>I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn’t stir. But
before she could break it open she dropped it and run–for she see
something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old
doctor; and Jim, in HER calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;
and a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that come
handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:</p>
<p>“Oh, he’s dead, he’s dead, I know he’s dead!“</p>
<p>And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
which showed he warn’t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,
and says:</p>
<p>“He’s alive, thank God! And that’s enough!“ and she snatched a kiss
of him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering
orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her
tongue could go, every jump of the way.</p>
<p>I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the
old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men
was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to
all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn’t be trying to run
away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a
whole family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others
said, don’t do it, it wouldn’t answer at all; he ain’t our nigger, and
his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled
them down a little, because the people that’s always the most anxious
for to hang a nigger that hain’t done just right is always the very ones
that ain’t the most anxious to pay for him when they’ve got their
satisfaction out of him.</p>
<p>They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side
the head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let
on to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own
clothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time,
but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands,
too, and both legs, and said he warn’t to have nothing but bread and
water to eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction
because he didn’t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our
hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around
about the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the
daytime; and about this time they was through with the job and was
tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old
doctor comes and takes a look, and says:</p>
<p>“Don’t be no rougher on him than you’re obleeged to, because he ain’t
a bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn’t cut
the bullet out without some help, and he warn’t in no condition for me
to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little
worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn’t let
me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he’d kill
me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn’t do
anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have HELP somehow; and the
minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he’ll
help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I judged he
must be a runaway nigger, and there I WAS! and there I had to stick
right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It was a
fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of
course I’d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn’t,
because the nigger might get away, and then I’d be to blame; and yet
never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick
plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a
better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,
and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he’d been worked main
hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a
nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars–and kind treatment, too. I
had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would
a done at home–better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I WAS,
with both of ’m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn
this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would
have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on
his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up
on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about,
and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty
sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her
over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor
said a word from the start. He ain’t no bad nigger, gentlemen; that’s
what I think about him.“</p>
<p>Somebody says:</p>
<p>“Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I’m obleeged to say.“</p>
<p>Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful
to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was
according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good
heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they all
agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some
notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised, right out
and hearty, that they wouldn’t cuss him no more.</p>
<p>Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say
he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten
heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they
didn’t think of it, and I reckoned it warn’t best for me to mix in, but
I judged I’d get the doctor’s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as
soon as I’d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me
–explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot
when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling
around hunting the runaway nigger.</p>
<p>But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day
and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged
him.</p>
<p>Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt
Sally was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found
him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would
wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale,
not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and laid for
him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and
there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and set down
by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now,
because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he’d been sleeping like
that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time,
and ten to one he’d wake up in his right mind.</p>
<p>So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened
his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:</p>
<p>“Hello!–why, I’m at HOME! How’s that? Where’s the raft?“</p>
<p>“It’s all right,“ I says.</p>
<p>“And JIM?“</p>
<p>“The same,“ I says, but couldn’t say it pretty brash. But he never
noticed, but says:</p>
<p>“Good! Splendid! NOW we’re all right and safe! Did you tell
Aunty?“</p>
<p>I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: “About what,
Sid?“</p>
<p>“Why, about the way the whole thing was done.“</p>
<p>“What whole thing?“</p>
<p>“Why, THE whole thing. There ain’t but one; how we set the runaway
nigger free–me and Tom.“</p>
<p>“Good land! Set the run–What IS the child talking about! Dear, dear,
out of his head again!“</p>
<p>“NO, I ain’t out of my HEAD; I know all what I’m talking about. We
DID set him free–me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we DONE it. And
we done it elegant, too.“ He’d got a start, and she never checked him
up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it
warn’t no use for ME to put in. “Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work
–weeks of it–hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep.
And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your
dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan,
and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can’t
think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and
one thing or another, and you can’t think HALF the fun it was. And we
had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters
from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the
hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up
in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron
pocket–“</p>
<p>“Mercy sakes!“</p>
<p>“–and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company
for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat
that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come
before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us
and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path
and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn’t interested in us,
but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the
raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by
ourselves, and WASN’T it bully, Aunty!“</p>
<p>“Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was
YOU, you little rapscallions, that’s been making all this trouble, and
turned everybody’s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to
death. I’ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o’
you this very minute. To think, here I’ve been, night after night, a–YOU
just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I’ll tan the Old Harry
out o’ both o’ ye!“</p>
<p>But Tom, he WAS so proud and joyful, he just COULDN’T hold in, and
his tongue just WENT it–she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along,
and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she
says:</p>
<p>“WELL, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it NOW, for mind I
tell you if I catch you meddling with him again–“</p>
<p>“Meddling with WHO?“ Tom says, dropping his smile and looking
surprised.</p>
<p>“With WHO? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who’d you reckon?“</p>
<p>Tom looks at me very grave, and says:</p>
<p>“Tom, didn’t you just tell me he was all right? Hasn’t he got
away?“</p>
<p>“HIM?“ says Aunt Sally; “the runaway nigger? ’Deed he hasn’t. They’ve
got him back, safe and sound, and he’s in that cabin again, on bread and
water, and loaded down with chains, till he’s claimed or sold!“</p>
<p>Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening
and shutting like gills, and sings out to me:</p>
<p>“They hain’t no RIGHT to shut him up! SHOVE!–and don’t you lose a
minute. Turn him loose! he ain’t no slave; he’s as free as any cretur
that walks this earth!“</p>
<p>“What DOES the child mean?“</p>
<p>“I mean every word I SAY, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don’t go, I’LL
go. I’ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss Watson
died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him
down the river, and SAID so; and she set him free in her will.“</p>
<p>“Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for, seeing he was
already free?“</p>
<p>“Well, that IS a question, I must say; and just like women! Why, I
wanted the ADVENTURE of it; and I’d a waded neck-deep in blood to
–goodness alive, AUNT POLLY!“</p>
<p>If she warn’t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as
sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may
never!</p>
<p>Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and
cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed,
for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped out,
and in a little while Tom’s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood
there looking across at Tom over her spectacles–kind of grinding him
into the earth, you know. And then she says:</p>
<p>“Yes, you BETTER turn y’r head away–I would if I was you, Tom.“</p>
<p>“Oh, deary me!“ says Aunt Sally; “IS he changed so? Why, that ain’t
TOM, it’s Sid; Tom’s–Tom’s–why, where is Tom? He was here a minute
ago.“</p>
<p>“You mean where’s Huck FINN–that’s what you mean! I reckon I hain’t
raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I SEE
him. That WOULD be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that bed, Huck
Finn.“</p>
<p>So I done it. But not feeling brash.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see
–except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it
all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn’t
know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting
sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the
oldest man in the world couldn’t a understood it. So Tom’s Aunt Polly,
she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I
was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom
Sawyer–she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I’m
used to it now, and ’tain’t no need to change“–that when Aunt Sally took
me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it–there warn’t no other way, and I
knowed he wouldn’t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a
mystery, and he’d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly
satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made
things as soft as he could for me.</p>
<p>And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson
setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone
and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I
couldn’t ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he
COULD help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.</p>
<p>Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom
and SID had come all right and safe, she says to herself:</p>
<p>“Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that
way without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all the
way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that
creetur’s up to THIS time, as long as I couldn’t seem to get any answer
out of you about it.“</p>
<p>“Why, I never heard nothing from you,“ says Aunt Sally.</p>
<p>“Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could
mean by Sid being here.“</p>
<p>“Well, I never got ’em, Sis.“</p>
<p>Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:</p>
<p>“You, Tom!“</p>
<p>“Well–WHAT?“ he says, kind of pettish.</p>
<p>“Don t you what ME, you impudent thing–hand out them letters.“</p>
<p>“What letters?“</p>
<p>“THEM letters. I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I’ll–“</p>
<p>“They’re in the trunk. There, now. And they’re just the same as they
was when I got them out of the office. I hain’t looked into them, I
hain’t touched them. But I knowed they’d make trouble, and I thought if
you warn’t in no hurry, I’d–“</p>
<p>“Well, you DO need skinning, there ain’t no mistake about it. And I
wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s’pose he–“</p>
<p>“No, it come yesterday; I hain’t read it yet, but IT’S all right,
I’ve got that one.“</p>
<p>I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn’t, but I reckoned maybe
it was just as safe to not to. So I never said nothing.</p>
<p>CHAPTER THE LAST</p>
<p>THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea,
time of the evasion?–what it was he’d planned to do if the evasion
worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already
free before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the
start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river
on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and
then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on a
steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead
and get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town
with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a
hero, and so would we. But I reckoned it was about as well the way it
was.</p>
<p>We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and
Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse
Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give
him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had
him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty
dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,
and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:</p>
<p>“DAH, now, Huck, what I tell you?–what I tell you up dah on Jackson
islan’? I TOLE you I got a hairy breas’, en what’s de sign un it; en I
TOLE you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich AGIN; en it’s come
true; en heah she is! DAH, now! doan’ talk to ME–signs is SIGNS, mine I
tell you; en I knowed jis’ ‘s well ’at I ’uz gwineter be rich agin as
I’s a-stannin’ heah dis minute!“</p>
<p>And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le’s all
three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go
for howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a
couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I
ain’t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn’t get
none from home, because it’s likely pap’s been back before now, and got
it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.</p>
<p>“No, he hain’t,“ Tom says; “it’s all there yet–six thousand dollars
and more; and your pap hain’t ever been back since. Hadn’t when I come
away, anyhow.“</p>
<p>Jim says, kind of solemn:</p>
<p>“He ain’t a-comin’ back no mo’, Huck.“</p>
<p>I says:</p>
<p>“Why, Jim?“</p>
<p>“Nemmine why, Huck–but he ain’t comin’ back no mo.“</p>
<p>But I kept at him; so at last he says:</p>
<p>“Doan’ you ‘member de house dat was float’n down de river, en dey wuz
a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn’ let
you come in? Well, den, you kin git yo’ money when you wants it, kase
dat wuz him.“</p>
<p>Tom’s most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a
watch-guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so
there ain’t nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it,
because if I’d a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn’t
a tackled it, and ain’t a-going to no more. But I reckon I got to light
out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she’s going
to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can’t stand it. I been there
before.</p>

<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>The ungentle laws and customs touched upon in this tale are
historical, and the episodes which are used to illustrate them are also
historical. It is not pretended that these laws and customs existed in
England in the sixth century; no, it is only pretended that inasmuch as
they existed in the English and other civilizations of far later times,
it is safe to consider that it is no libel upon the sixth century to
suppose them to have been in practice in that day also. One is quite
justified in inferring that whatever one of these laws or customs was
lacking in that remote time, its place was competently filled by a worse
one.</p>
<p>The question as to whether there is such a thing as divine right of
kings is not settled in this book. It was found too difficult. That the
executive head of a nation should be a person of lofty character and
extraordinary ability, was manifest and indisputable; that none but the
Deity could select that head unerringly, was also manifest and
indisputable; that the Deity ought to make that selection, then, was
likewise manifest and indisputable; consequently, that He does make it,
as claimed, was an unavoidable deduction. I mean, until the author of
this book encountered the Pompadour, and Lady Castlemaine, and some
other executive heads of that kind; these were found so difficult to
work into the scheme, that it was judged better to take the other tack
in this book (which must be issued this fall), and then go into training
and settle the question in another book. It is, of course, a thing which
ought to be settled, and I am not going to have anything particular to
do next winter anyway.</p>

YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR’S COURT</h2>
<p>A WORD OF EXPLANATION</p>
<p>It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom
I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid
simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the
restfulness of his company–for he did all the talking. We fell together,
as modest people will, in the tail of the herd that was being shown
through, and he at once began to say things which interested me. As he
talked along, softly, pleasantly, flowingly, he seemed to drift away
imperceptibly out of this world and time, and into some remote era and
old forgotten country; and so he gradually wove such a spell about me
that I seemed to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold
of a gray antiquity, holding speech with a relic of it! Exactly as I
would speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies, or my most
familiar neighbors, he spoke of Sir Bedivere, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir
Launcelot of the Lake, Sir Galahad, and all the other great names of the
Table Round–and how old, old, unspeakably old and faded and dry and
musty and ancient he came to look as he went on! Presently he turned to
me and said, just as one might speak of the weather, or any other common
matter–</p>
<p>“You know about transmigration of souls; do you know about
transposition of epochs–and bodies?“</p>
<p>I said I had not heard of it. He was so little interested–just as
when people speak of the weather–that he did not notice whether I made
him any answer or not. There was half a moment of silence, immediately
interrupted by the droning voice of the salaried cicerone:</p>
<p>“Ancient hauberk, date of the sixth century, time of King Arthur and
the Round Table; said to have belonged to the knight Sir Sagramor le
Desirous; observe the round hole through the chain-mail in the left
breast; can’t be accounted for; supposed to have been done with a bullet
since invention of firearms–perhaps maliciously by Cromwell’s
soldiers.“</p>
<p>My acquaintance smiled–not a modern smile, but one that must have
gone out of general use many, many centuries ago–and muttered apparently
to himself:</p>
<p>“Wit ye well, <em>I saw it done</em>.“ Then, after a pause, added: “I
did it myself.“</p>
<p>By the time I had recovered from the electric surprise of this
remark, he was gone.</p>
<p>All that evening I sat by my fire at the Warwick Arms, steeped in a
dream of the olden time, while the rain beat upon the windows, and the
wind roared about the eaves and corners. From time to time I dipped into
old Sir Thomas Malory’s enchanting book, and fed at its rich feast of
prodigies and adventures, breathed in the fragrance of its obsolete
names, and dreamed again. Midnight being come at length, I read another
tale, for a nightcap–this which here follows, to wit:</p>
<p>HOW SIR LAUNCELOT SLEW TWO GIANTS, AND MADE A CASTLE FREE</p>
<p>Anon withal came there upon him two great giants, well armed, all
save the heads, with two horrible clubs in their hands. Sir Launcelot
put his shield afore him, and put the stroke away of the one giant, and
with his sword he clave his head asunder. When his fellow saw that, he
ran away as he were wood [*demented], for fear of the horrible strokes,
and Sir Launcelot after him with all his might, and smote him on the
shoulder, and clave him to the middle. Then Sir Launcelot went into the
hall, and there came afore him three score ladies and damsels, and all
kneeled unto him, and thanked God and him of their deliverance. For,
sir, said they, the most part of us have been here this seven year their
prisoners, and we have worked all manner of silk works for our meat, and
we are all great gentle-women born, and blessed be the time, knight,
that ever thou wert born; for thou hast done the most worship that ever
did knight in the world, that will we bear record, and we all pray you
to tell us your name, that we may tell our friends who delivered us out
of prison. Fair damsels, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. And
so he departed from them and betaught them unto God. And then he mounted
upon his horse, and rode into many strange and wild countries, and
through many waters and valleys, and evil was he lodged. And at the last
by fortune him happened against a night to come to a fair courtilage,
and therein he found an old gentle-woman that lodged him with a
good-will, and there he had good cheer for him and his horse. And when
time was, his host brought him into a fair garret over the gate to his
bed. There Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness by him, and
went to bed, and anon he fell on sleep. So, soon after there came one on
horseback, and knocked at the gate in great haste. And when Sir
Launcelot heard this he rose up, and looked out at the window, and saw
by the moonlight three knights come riding after that one man, and all
three lashed on him at once with swords, and that one knight turned on
them knightly again and defended him. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, yonder
one knight shall I help, for it were shame for me to see three knights
on one, and if he be slain I am partner of his death. And therewith he
took his harness and went out at a window by a sheet down to the four
knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high, Turn you knights unto me,
and leave your fighting with that knight. And then they all three left
Sir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot, and there began great battle,
for they alight all three, and strake many strokes at Sir Launcelot, and
assailed him on every side. Then Sir Kay dressed him for to have holpen
Sir Launcelot. Nay, sir, said he, I will none of your help, therefore as
ye will have my help let me alone with them. Sir Kay for the pleasure of
the knight suffered him for to do his will, and so stood aside. And then
anon within six strokes Sir Launcelot had stricken them to the
earth.</p>
<p>And then they all three cried, Sir Knight, we yield us unto you as
man of might matchless. As to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take
your yielding unto me, but so that ye yield you unto Sir Kay the
seneschal, on that covenant I will save your lives and else not. Fair
knight, said they, that were we loath to do; for as for Sir Kay we
chased him hither, and had overcome him had ye not been; therefore, to
yield us unto him it were no reason. Well, as to that, said Sir
Launcelot, advise you well, for ye may choose whether ye will die or
live, for an ye be yielden, it shall be unto Sir Kay. Fair knight, then
they said, in saving our lives we will do as thou commandest us. Then
shall ye, said Sir Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming go unto the
court of King Arthur, and there shall ye yield you unto Queen Guenever,
and put you all three in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay sent
you thither to be her prisoners. On the morn Sir Launcelot arose early,
and left Sir Kay sleeping; and Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay’s armor and
his shield and armed him, and so he went to the stable and took his
horse, and took his leave of his host, and so he departed. Then soon
after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot; and then he espied that he
had his armor and his horse. Now by my faith I know well that he will
grieve some of the court of King Arthur; for on him knights will be
bold, and deem that it is I, and that will beguile them; and because of
his armor and shield I am sure I shall ride in peace. And then soon
after departed Sir Kay, and thanked his host.</p>
<p>As I laid the book down there was a knock at the door, and my
stranger came in. I gave him a pipe and a chair, and made him welcome. I
also comforted him with a hot Scotch whisky; gave him another one; then
still another–hoping always for his story. After a fourth persuader, he
drifted into it himself, in a quite simple and natural way:</p>
<p>THE STRANGER’S HISTORY</p>
<p>I am an American. I was born and reared in Hartford, in the State of
Connecticut–anyway, just over the river, in the country. So I am a
Yankee of the Yankees–and practical; yes, and nearly barren of
sentiment, I suppose–or poetry, in other words. My father was a
blacksmith, my uncle was a horse doctor, and I was both, along at first.
Then I went over to the great arms factory and learned my real trade;
learned all there was to it; learned to make everything: guns,
revolvers, cannon, boilers, engines, all sorts of labor-saving
machinery. Why, I could make anything a body wanted–anything in the
world, it didn’t make any difference what; and if there wasn’t any quick
new-fangled way to make a thing, I could invent one–and do it as easy as
rolling off a log. I became head superintendent; had a couple of
thousand men under me.</p>
<p>Well, a man like that is a man that is full of fight–that goes
without saying. With a couple of thousand rough men under one, one has
plenty of that sort of amusement. I had, anyway. At last I met my match,
and I got my dose. It was during a misunderstanding conducted with
crowbars with a fellow we used to call Hercules. He laid me out with a
crusher alongside the head that made everything crack, and seemed to
spring every joint in my skull and made it overlap its neighbor. Then
the world went out in darkness, and I didn’t feel anything more, and
didn’t know anything at all –at least for a while.</p>
<p>When I came to again, I was sitting under an oak tree, on the grass,
with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all to myself–nearly.
Not entirely; for there was a fellow on a horse, looking down at me–a
fellow fresh out of a picture-book. He was in old-time iron armor from
head to heel, with a helmet on his head the shape of a nail-keg with
slits in it; and he had a shield, and a sword, and a prodigious spear;
and his horse had armor on, too, and a steel horn projecting from his
forehead, and gorgeous red and green silk trappings that hung down all
around him like a bedquilt, nearly to the ground.</p>
<p>“Fair sir, will ye just?“ said this fellow.</p>
<p>“Will I which?“</p>
<p>“Will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for–“</p>
<p>“What are you giving me?“ I said. “Get along back to your circus, or
I’ll report you.“</p>
<p>Now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards and
then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear, with his nail-keg bent
down nearly to his horse’s neck and his long spear pointed straight
ahead. I saw he meant business, so I was up the tree when he
arrived.</p>
<p>He allowed that I was his property, the captive of his spear. There
was argument on his side–and the bulk of the advantage –so I judged it
best to humor him. We fixed up an agreement whereby I was to go with him
and he was not to hurt me. I came down, and we started away, I walking
by the side of his horse. We marched comfortably along, through glades
and over brooks which I could not remember to have seen before–which
puzzled me and made me wonder–and yet we did not come to any circus or
sign of a circus. So I gave up the idea of a circus, and concluded he
was from an asylum. But we never came to an asylum–so I was up a stump,
as you may say. I asked him how far we were from Hartford. He said he
had never heard of the place; which I took to be a lie, but allowed it
to go at that. At the end of an hour we saw a far-away town sleeping in
a valley by a winding river; and beyond it on a hill, a vast gray
fortress, with towers and turrets, the first I had ever seen out of a
picture.</p>
<p>“Bridgeport?“ said I, pointing.</p>
<p>“Camelot,“ said he.</p>
<p>My stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness. He caught himself
nodding, now, and smiled one of those pathetic, obsolete smiles of his,
and said:</p>
<p>“I find I can’t go on; but come with me, I’ve got it all written out,
and you can read it if you like.“</p>
<p>In his chamber, he said: “First, I kept a journal; then by and by,
after years, I took the journal and turned it into a book. How long ago
that was!“</p>
<p>He handed me his manuscript, and pointed out the place where I should
begin:</p>
<p>“Begin here–I’ve already told you what goes before.“ He was steeped
in drowsiness by this time. As I went out at his door I heard him murmur
sleepily: “Give you good den, fair sir.“</p>
<p>I sat down by my fire and examined my treasure. The first part of
it–the great bulk of it–was parchment, and yellow with age. I scanned a
leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest. Under the old dim
writing of the Yankee historian appeared traces of a penmanship which
was older and dimmer still–Latin words and sentences: fragments from old
monkish legends, evidently. I turned to the place indicated by my
stranger and began to read –as follows:</p>
<p>THE TALE OF THE LOST LAND</p>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>CAMELOT</p>
<p>“Camelot–Camelot,“ said I to myself. “I don’t seem to remember
hearing of it before. Name of the asylum, likely.“</p>
<p>It was a soft, reposeful summer landscape, as lovely as a dream, and
as lonesome as Sunday. The air was full of the smell of flowers, and the
buzzing of insects, and the twittering of birds, and there were no
people, no wagons, there was no stir of life, nothing going on. The road
was mainly a winding path with hoof-prints in it, and now and then a
faint trace of wheels on either side in the grass–wheels that apparently
had a tire as broad as one’s hand.</p>
<p>Presently a fair slip of a girl, about ten years old, with a cataract
of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders, came along. Around her
head she wore a hoop of flame-red poppies. It was as sweet an outfit as
ever I saw, what there was of it. She walked indolently along, with a
mind at rest, its peace reflected in her innocent face. The circus man
paid no attention to her; didn’t even seem to see her. And she–she was
no more startled at his fantastic make-up than if she was used to his
like every day of her life. She was going by as indifferently as she
might have gone by a couple of cows; but when she happened to notice me,
<em>then</em> there was a change! Up went her hands, and she was turned
to stone; her mouth dropped open, her eyes stared wide and timorously,
she was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear. And there
she stood gazing, in a sort of stupefied fascination, till we turned a
corner of the wood and were lost to her view. That she should be
startled at me instead of at the other man, was too many for me; I
couldn’t make head or tail of it. And that she should seem to consider
me a spectacle, and totally overlook her own merits in that respect, was
another puzzling thing, and a display of magnanimity, too, that was
surprising in one so young. There was food for thought here. I moved
along as one in a dream.</p>
<p>As we approached the town, signs of life began to appear. At
intervals we passed a wretched cabin, with a thatched roof, and about it
small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of cultivation.
There were people, too; brawny men, with long, coarse, uncombed hair
that hung down over their faces and made them look like animals. They
and the women, as a rule, wore a coarse tow-linen robe that came well
below the knee, and a rude sort of sandal, and many wore an iron collar.
The small boys and girls were always naked; but nobody seemed to know
it. All of these people stared at me, talked about me, ran into the huts
and fetched out their families to gape at me; but nobody ever noticed
that other fellow, except to make him humble salutation and get no
response for their pains.</p>
<p>In the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone
scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins; the streets were mere
crooked alleys, and unpaved; troops of dogs and nude children played in
the sun and made life and noise; hogs roamed and rooted contentedly
about, and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in the middle of the main
thoroughfare and suckled her family. Presently there was a distant blare
of military music; it came nearer, still nearer, and soon a noble
cavalcade wound into view, glorious with plumed helmets and flashing
mail and flaunting banners and rich doublets and horse-cloths and gilded
spearheads; and through the muck and swine, and naked brats, and joyous
dogs, and shabby huts, it took its gallant way, and in its wake we
followed. Followed through one winding alley and then another,–and
climbing, always climbing–till at last we gained the breezy height where
the huge castle stood. There was an exchange of bugle blasts; then a
parley from the walls, where men-at-arms, in hauberk and morion, marched
back and forth with halberd at shoulder under flapping banners with the
rude figure of a dragon displayed upon them; and then the great gates
were flung open, the drawbridge was lowered, and the head of the
cavalcade swept forward under the frowning arches; and we, following,
soon found ourselves in a great paved court, with towers and turrets
stretching up into the blue air on all the four sides; and all about us
the dismount was going on, and much greeting and ceremony, and running
to and fro, and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors, and an
altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion.</p>
