<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>Washington dreamed his way along the street, his fancy flitting from
grain to hogs, from hogs to banks, from banks to eyewater, from
eye-water to Tennessee Land, and lingering but a feverish moment upon
each of these fascinations. He was conscious of but one outward thing,
to wit, the General, and he was really not vividly conscious of him.</p>
<p>Arrived at the finest dwelling in the town, they entered it and were
at home. Washington was introduced to Mrs. Boswell, and his imagination
was on the point of flitting into the vapory realms of speculation
again, when a lovely girl of sixteen or seventeen came in. This vision
swept Washington’s mind clear of its chaos of glittering rubbish in an
instant. Beauty had fascinated him before; many times he had been in
love even for weeks at a time with the same object but his heart had
never suffered so sudden and so fierce an assault as this, within his
recollection.</p>
<p>Louise Boswell occupied his mind and drifted among his multiplication
tables all the afternoon. He was constantly catching himself in a
reverie–reveries made up of recalling how she looked when she first
burst upon him; how her voice thrilled him when she first spoke; how
charmed the very air seemed by her presence. Blissful as the afternoon
was, delivered up to such a revel as this, it seemed an eternity, so
impatient was he to see the girl again. Other afternoons like it
followed. Washington plunged into this love affair as he plunged into
everything else–upon impulse and without reflection. As the days went by
it seemed plain that he was growing in favor with Louise,–not sweepingly
so, but yet perceptibly, he fancied. His attentions to her troubled her
father and mother a little, and they warned Louise, without stating
particulars or making allusions to any special person, that a girl was
sure to make a mistake who allowed herself to marry anybody but a man
who could support her well.</p>
<p>Some instinct taught Washington that his present lack of money would
be an obstruction, though possibly not a bar, to his hopes, and
straightway his poverty became a torture to him which cast all his
former sufferings under that held into the shade. He longed for riches
now as he had ever longed for them before.</p>
<p>He had been once or twice to dine with Col. Sellers, and had been
discouraged to note that the Colonel’s bill of fare was falling off both
in quantity and quality–a sign, he feared, that the lacking ingredient
in the eye-water still remained undiscovered–though Sellers always
explained that these changes in the family diet had been ordered by the
doctor, or suggested by some new scientific work the Colonel had
stumbled upon. But it always turned out that the lacking ingredient was
still lacking–though it always appeared, at the same time, that the
Colonel was right on its heels.</p>
<p>Every time the Colonel came into the real estate office Washington’s
heart bounded and his eyes lighted with hope, but it always turned out
that the Colonel was merely on the scent of some vast, undefined landed
speculation–although he was customarily able to say that he was nearer
to the all-necessary ingredient than ever, and could almost name the
hour when success would dawn. And then Washington’s heart world sink
again and a sigh would tell when it touched bottom.</p>
<p>About this time a letter came, saying that Judge Hawkins had been
ailing for a fortnight, and was now considered to be seriously ill. It
was thought best that Washington should come home. The news filled him
with grief, for he loved and honored his father; the Boswells were
touched by the youth’s sorrow, and even the General unbent and said
encouraging things to him.–There was balm in this; but when Louise bade
him good-bye, and shook his hand and said, “Don’t be cast down–it will
all come out right–I know it will all come out right,“ it seemed a
blessed thing to be in misfortune, and the tears that welled up to his
eyes were the messengers of an adoring and a grateful heart; and when
the girl saw them and answering tears came into her own eyes, Washington
could hardly contain the excess of happiness that poured into the
cavities of his breast that were so lately stored to the roof with
grief.</p>
<p>All the way home he nursed his woe and exalted it. He pictured
himself as she must be picturing him: a noble, struggling young spirit
persecuted by misfortune, but bravely and patiently waiting in the
shadow of a dread calamity and preparing to meet the blow as became one
who was all too used to hard fortune and the pitiless buffetings of
fate. These thoughts made him weep, and weep more broken-heartedly than
ever; and be wished that she could see his sufferings now.</p>
<p>There was nothing significant in the fact that Louise, dreamy and
distraught, stood at her bedroom bureau that night, scribbling
“Washington“ here and there over a sheet of paper. But there was
something significant in the fact that she scratched the word out every
time she wrote it; examined the erasure critically to see if anybody
could guess at what the word had been; then buried it under a maze of
obliterating lines; and finally, as if still unsatisfied, burned the
paper.</p>
<p>When Washington reached home, he recognized at once how serious his
father’s case was. The darkened room, the labored breathing and
occasional moanings of the patient, the tip-toeing of the attendants and
their whispered consultations, were full of sad meaning. For three or
four nights Mrs. Hawkins and Laura had been watching by the bedside;
Clay had arrived, preceding Washington by one day, and he was now added
to the corps of watchers. Mr. Hawkins would have none but these three,
though neighborly assistance was offered by old friends. From this time
forth three-hour watches were instituted, and day and night the watchers
kept their vigils. By degrees Laura and her mother began to show wear,
but neither of them would yield a minute of their tasks to Clay. He
ventured once to let the midnight hour pass without calling Laura, but
he ventured no more; there was that about her rebuke when he tried to
explain, that taught him that to let her sleep when she might be
ministering to her father’s needs, was to rob her of moments that were
priceless in her eyes; he perceived that she regarded it as a privilege
to watch, not a burden. And, he had noticed, also, that when midnight
struck, the patient turned his eyes toward the door, with an expectancy
in them which presently grew into a longing but brightened into
contentment as soon as the door opened and Laura appeared. And he did
not need Laura’s rebuke when he heard his father say:</p>
<p>“Clay is good, and you are tired, poor child; but I wanted you
so.“</p>
<p>“Clay is not good, father–he did not call me. I would not have
treated him so. How could you do it, Clay?“</p>
<p>Clay begged forgiveness and promised not to break faith again; and as
he betook him to his bed, he said to himself: “It’s a steadfast little
soul; whoever thinks he is doing the Duchess a kindness by intimating
that she is not sufficient for any undertaking she puts her hand to,
makes a mistake; and if I did not know it before, I know now that there
are surer ways of pleasing her than by trying to lighten her labor when
that labor consists in wearing herself out for the sake of a person she
loves.“</p>
<p>A week drifted by, and all the while the patient sank lower and
lower. The night drew on that was to end all suspense. It was a wintry
one. The darkness gathered, the snow was falling, the wind wailed
plaintively about the house or shook it with fitful gusts. The doctor
had paid his last visit and gone away with that dismal remark to the
nearest friend of the family that he “believed there was nothing more
that he could do“ –a remark which is always overheard by some one it is
not meant for and strikes a lingering half-conscious hope dead with a
withering shock; the medicine phials had been removed from the bedside
and put out of sight, and all things made orderly and meet for the
solemn event that was impending; the patient, with closed eyes, lay
scarcely breathing; the watchers sat by and wiped the gathering damps
from his forehead while the silent tears flowed down their faces; the
deep hush was only interrupted by sobs from the children, grouped about
the bed.</p>
<p>After a time–it was toward midnight now–Mr. Hawkins roused out of a
doze, looked about him and was evidently trying to speak. Instantly
Laura lifted his head and in a failing voice he said, while something of
the old light shone in his eyes:</p>
<p>“Wife–children–come nearer–nearer. The darkness grows. Let me see you
all, once more.“</p>
<p>The group closed together at the bedside, and their tears and sobs
came now without restraint.</p>
<p>“I am leaving you in cruel poverty. I have been–so foolish–so
short-sighted. But courage! A better day is–is coming. Never lose sight
of the Tennessee Land! Be wary. There is wealth stored up for you there
–wealth that is boundless! The children shall hold up their heads with
the best in the land, yet. Where are the papers?–Have you got the papers
safe? Show them–show them to me!“</p>
<p>Under his strong excitement his voice had gathered power and his last
sentences were spoken with scarcely a perceptible halt or hindrance.
With an effort he had raised himself almost without assistance to a
sitting posture. But now the fire faded out of his eyes and be fell back
exhausted. The papers were brought and held before him, and the
answering smile that flitted across his face showed that he was
satisfied. He closed his eyes, and the signs of approaching dissolution
multiplied rapidly. He lay almost motionless for a little while, then
suddenly partly raised his head and looked about him as one who peers
into a dim uncertain light. He muttered:</p>
<p>“Gone? No–I see you–still. It is–it is-over. But you are–safe. Safe.
The Ten—–“</p>
<p>The voice died out in a whisper; the sentence was never finished. The
emaciated fingers began to pick at the coverlet, a fatal sign. After a
time there were no sounds but the cries of the mourners within and the
gusty turmoil of the wind without. Laura had bent down and kissed her
father’s lips as the spirit left the body; but she did not sob, or utter
any ejaculation; her tears flowed silently. Then she closed the dead
eyes, and crossed the hands upon the breast; after a season, she kissed
the forehead reverently, drew the sheet up over the face, and then
walked apart and sat down with the look of one who is done with life and
has no further interest in its joys and sorrows, its hopes or its
ambitions. Clay buried his face in the coverlet of the bed; when the
other children and the mother realized that death was indeed come at
last, they threw themselves into each others’ arms and gave way to a
frenzy of grief.</p>
