<h4 id="letters-to-mrs.-clemens-in-heidelberg">LETTERs to Mrs. Clemens,
in Heidelberg:</h4>
<p>ALLERHEILIGEN Aug. 5, 1878 8:30 p.m. Livy darling, we had a rattling
good time to-day, but we came very near being left at Baden-Baden, for
instead of waiting in the waiting-room, we sat down on the platform to
wait where the trains come in from the other direction. We sat there
full ten minutes–and then all of a sudden it occurred to me that that
was not the right place.</p>
<p>On the train the principal of the big English school at Nauheim (of
which Mr. Scheiding was a teacher), introduced himself to me, and then
he mapped out our day for us (for today and tomorrow) and also drew a
map and gave us directions how to proceed through Switzerland. He had
his entire school with him, taking them on a prodigious trip through
Switzerland–tickets for the round trip ten dollars apiece. He has done
this annually for 10 years. We took a post carriage from Aachen to
Otterhofen for 7 marks–stopped at the “Pflug“ to drink beer, and saw
that pretty girl again at a distance. Her father, mother, and two
brothers received me like an ancient customer and sat down and talked as
long as I had any German left. The big room was full of red-vested
farmers (the Gemeindrath of the district, with the Burgermeister at the
head,) drinking beer and talking public business. They had held an
election and chosen a new member and had been drinking beer at his
expense for several hours. (It was intensely Black-foresty.)</p>
<p>There was an Australian there (a student from Stuttgart or
somewhere,) and Joe told him who I was and he laid himself out to make
our course plain, for us–so I am certain we can’t get lost between here
and Heidelberg.</p>
<p>We walked the carriage road till we came to that place where one sees
the foot path on the other side of the ravine, then we crossed over and
took that. For a good while we were in a dense forest and judged we were
lost, but met a native women who said we were all right. We fooled along
and got there at 6 p.m.–ate supper, then followed down the ravine to the
foot of the falls, then struck into a blind path to see where it would
go, and just about dark we fetched up at the Devil’s Pulpit on top of
the hills. Then home. And now to bed, pretty sleepy. Joe sends love and
I send a thousand times as much, my darling. S. L. C.</p>
<p>HOTEL GENNIN. Livy darling, we had a lovely day jogged right along,
with a good horse and sensible driver–the last two hours right behind an
open carriage filled with a pleasant German family–old gentleman and 3
pretty daughters. At table d’hote tonight, 3 dishes were enough for me,
and then I bored along tediously through the bill of fare, with a
back-ache, not daring to get up and bow to the German family and leave.
I meant to sit it through and make them get up and do the bowing; but at
last Joe took pity on me and said he would get up and drop them a curtsy
and put me out of my misery. I was grateful. He got up and delivered a
succession of frank and hearty bows, accompanying them with an
atmosphere of good-fellowship which would have made even an English
family surrender. Of course the Germans responded–then I got right up
and they had to respond to my salaams, too. So “that was done.“</p>
<p>We walked up a gorge and saw a tumbling waterfall which was nothing
to Giessbach, but it made me resolve to drop you a line and urge you to
go and see Giessbach illuminated. Don’t fail–but take a long day’s rest,
first. I love you, sweetheart. SAML.</p>
<p>OVER THE GEMMI PASS. 4.30 p.m. Saturday, Aug. 24, 1878. Livy darling,
Joe and I have had a most noble day. Started to climb (on foot) at 8.30
this morning among the grandest peaks! Every half hour carried us back a
month in the season. We left them harvesting 2d crop of hay. At 9 we
were in July and found ripe strawberries; at 9.30 we were in June and
gathered flowers belonging to that month; at 10 we were in May and
gathered a flower which appeared in Heidelberg the 17th of that month;
also forget-me-nots, which disappeared from Heidelberg about mid-May; at
11.30 we were in April (by the flowers;) at noon we had rain and hail
mixed, and wind and enveloping fogs, and considered it March; at 12.30
we had snowbanks above us and snowbanks below us, and considered it
February. Not good February, though, because in the midst of the wild
desolation the forget-me-not still bloomed, lovely as ever.</p>
<p>What a flower garden the Gemmi Pass is! After I had got my hands full
Joe made me a paper bag, which I pinned to my lapel and filled with
choice specimens. I gathered no flowers which I had ever gathered before
except 4 or 5 kinds. We took it leisurely and I picked all I wanted to.
I mailed my harvest to you a while ago. Don’t send it to Mrs. Brooks
until you have looked it over, flower by flower. It will pay.</p>
<p>Among the clouds and everlasting snows I found a brave and bright
little forget-me-not growing in the very midst of a smashed and tumbled
stone-debris, just as cheerful as if the barren and awful domes and
ramparts that towered around were the blessed walls of heaven. I thought
how Lilly Warner would be touched by such a gracious surprise, if she,
instead of I, had seen it. So I plucked it, and have mailed it to her
with a note.</p>
<p>Our walk was 7 hours–the last 2 down a path as steep as a ladder,
almost, cut in the face of a mighty precipice. People are not allowed to
ride down it. This part of the day’s work taxed our knees, I tell you.
We have been loafing about this village (Leukerbad) for an hour, now we
stay here over Sunday. Not tired at all. (Joe’s hat fell over the
precipice–so he came here bareheaded.) I love you, my darling.</p>
<p>SAML.</p>
<p>ST. NICHOLAS, Aug. 26th, ’78. Livy darling, we came through
a-whooping today, 6 hours tramp up steep hills and down steep hills, in
mud and water shoe-deep, and in a steady pouring rain which never
moderated a moment. I was as chipper and fresh as a lark all the way and
arrived without the slightest sense of fatigue. But we were soaked and
my shoes full of water, so we ate at once, stripped and went to bed for
2 1/2 hours while our traps were thoroughly dried, and our boots greased
in addition. Then we put our clothes on hot and went to table
d’hote.</p>
<p>Made some nice English friends and shall see them at Zermatt
tomorrow.</p>
<p>Gathered a small bouquet of new flowers, but they got spoiled. I sent
you a safety-match box full of flowers last night from Leukerbad.</p>
<p>I have just telegraphed you to wire the family news to me at Riffel
tomorrow. I do hope you are all well and having as jolly a time as we
are, for I love you, sweetheart, and also, in a measure, the Bays.
–[Little Susy’s word for “babies.“]–Give my love to Clara Spaulding and
also to the cubs. SAML.</p>
<p>This, as far as it goes, is a truer and better account of the
excursion than Mark Twain gave in the book that he wrote later. A Tramp
Abroad has a quality of burlesque in it, which did not belong to the
journey at all, but was invented to satisfy the craving for what the
public conceived to be Mark Twain’s humor. The serious portions of the
book are much more pleasing–more like himself. The entire journey, as
will be seen, lasted one week more than a month.</p>
<p>Twichell also made his reports home, some of which give us
interesting pictures of his walking partner. In one place he wrote:
“Mark is a queer fellow. There is nothing he so delights in as a swift,
strong stream. You can hardly get him to leave one when once he is
within the influence of its fascinations.“</p>
<p>Twichell tells how at Kandersteg they were out together one evening
where a brook comes plunging down from Gasternthal and how he pushed in
a drift to see it go racing along the current. “When I got back to the
path Mark was running down stream after it as hard as he could go,
throwing up his hands and shouting in the wildest ecstasy, and when a
piece went over a fall and emerged to view in the foam below he would
jump up and down and yell. He said afterward that he had not been so
excited in three months.“</p>
<p>In other places Twichell refers to his companion’s consideration for
the feeling of others, and for animals. “When we are driving, his
concern is all about the horse. He can’t bear to see the whip used, or
to see a horse pull hard.“</p>
<p>After the walk over Gemmi Pass he wrote: “Mark to-day was immensely
absorbed in flowers. He scrambled around and gathered a great variety,
and manifested the intensest pleasure in them. He crowded a pocket of
his note-book with his specimens, and wanted more room.“</p>
<p>Whereupon Twichell got out his needle and thread and some stiff paper
he had and contrived the little paper bag to hang to the front of his
vest.</p>
<p>The tramp really ended at Lausanne, where Clemens joined his party,
but a short excursion to Chillon and Chamonix followed, the travelers
finally separating at Geneva, Twichell to set out for home by way of
England, Clemens to remain and try to write the story of their travels.
He hurried a good-by letter after his comrade:</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell:</p>
<p>(No date) DEAR OLD JOE,–It is actually all over! I was so
low-spirited at the station yesterday, and this morning, when I woke, I
couldn’t seem to accept the dismal truth that you were really gone, and
the pleasant tramping and talking at an end. Ah, my boy! it has been
such a rich holiday to me, and I feel under such deep and honest
obligations to you for coming. I am putting out of my mind all memory of
the times when I misbehaved toward you and hurt you: I am resolved to
consider it forgiven, and to store up and remember only the charming
hours of the journeys and the times when I was not unworthy to be with
you and share a companionship which to me stands first after Livy’s. It
is justifiable to do this; for why should I let my small infirmities of
disposition live and grovel among my mental pictures of the eternal
sublimities of the Alps?</p>
<p>Livy can’t accept or endure the fact that you are gone. But you are,
and we cannot get around it. So take our love with you, and bear it also
over the sea to Harmony, and God bless you both.</p>
<p>MARK.</p>
<p>From Switzerland the Clemens party worked down into Italy,
sight-seeing, a diversion in which Mark Twain found little enough of
interest. He had seen most of the sights ten years before, when his mind
was fresh. He unburdened himself to Twichell and to Howells, after a
period of suffering.</p>
<p>To J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>ROME, Nov. 3, ’78. DEAR JOE,–…..I have received your several letters,
and we have prodigiously enjoyed them. How I do admire a man who can sit
down and whale away with a pen just the same as if it was fishing–or
something else as full of pleasure and as void of labor. I can’t do it;
else, in common decency, I would when I write to you. Joe, if I can make
a book out of the matter gathered in your company over here, the book is
safe; but I don’t think I have gathered any matter before or since your
visit worth writing up. I do wish you were in Rome to do my sightseeing
for me. Rome interests me as much as East Hartford could, and no more.
That is, the Rome which the average tourist feels an interest in; but
there are other things here which stir me enough to make life worth
living. Livy and Clara Spaulding are having a royal time worshiping the
old Masters, and I as good a time gritting my ineffectual teeth over
them.</p>
<p>A friend waits for me. A power of love to you all. Amen. MARK.</p>
<p>In his letter to Howells he said: “I wish I could give those sharp
satires on European life which you mention, but of course a man can’t
write successful satire except he be in a calm, judicial good-humor;
whereas I hate travel, and I hate hotels, and I hate the opera, and I
hate the old masters. In truth, I don’t ever seem to be in a good-enough
humor with anything to satirize it. No, I want to stand up before it and
curse it and foam at the mouth, or take a club and pound it to rags and
pulp. I have got in two or three chapters about Wagner’s operas, and
managed to do it without showing temper, but the strain of another such
effort would burst me!“</p>
<p>From Italy the Clemens party went to Munich, where they had arranged
in advance for winter quarters. Clemens claims, in his report of the
matter to Howells, that he took the party through without the aid of a
courier, though thirty years later, in some comment which he set down on
being shown the letter, he wrote concerning this paragraph: “Probably a
lie.“ He wrote, also, that they acquired a great affection for Fraulein
Dahlweiner: “Acquired it at once and it outlasted the winter we spent in
her house.“</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>No 1a, Karlstrasse, 2e Stock. Care Fraulein Dahlweiner. MUNICH,
Nov. 17, 1878. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–We arrived here night before last,
pretty well fagged: an 8-hour pull from Rome to Florence; a rest there
of a day and two nights; then 5 1/2 hours to Bologna; one night’s rest;
then from noon to 10:30 p.m. carried us to Trent, in the Austrian Tyrol,
where the confounded hotel had not received our message, and so at that
miserable hour, in that snowy region, the tribe had to shiver together
in fireless rooms while beds were prepared and warmed, then up at 6 in
the morning and a noble view of snow-peaks glittering in the rich light
of a full moon while the hotel-devils lazily deranged a breakfast for us
in the dreary gloom of blinking candles; then a solid 12 hours pull
through the loveliest snow ranges and snow-draped forest–and at 7 p.m.
we hauled up, in drizzle and fog, at the domicile which had been engaged
for us ten months before. Munich did seem the horriblest place, the most
desolate place, the most unendurable place!–and the rooms were so small,
the conveniences so meagre, and the porcelain stoves so grim, ghastly,
dismal, intolerable! So Livy and Clara (Spaulding) sat down forlorn, and
cried, and I retired to a private, place to pray. By and by we all
retired to our narrow German beds; and when Livy and I finished talking
across the room, it was all decided that we would rest 24 hours then pay
whatever damages were required, and straightway fly to the south of
France.</p>
<p>But you see, that was simply fatigue. Next morning the tribe fell in
love with the rooms, with the weather, with Munich, and head over heels
in love with Fraulein Dahlweiner. We got a larger parlor–an ample one
–threw two communicating bedrooms into one, for the children, and now we
are entirely comfortable. The only apprehension, at present, is that the
climate may not be just right for the children, in which case we shall
have to go to France, but it will be with the sincerest regret.</p>
<p>Now I brought the tribe through from Rome, myself. We never had so
little trouble before. The next time anybody has a courier to put out to
nurse, I shall not be in the market.</p>
<p>Last night the forlornities had all disappeared; so we gathered
around the lamp, after supper, with our beer and my pipe, and in a
condition of grateful snugness tackled the new magazines. I read your
new story aloud, amid thunders of applause, and we all agreed that
Captain Jenness and the old man with the accordion-hat are lovely people
and most skillfully drawn–and that cabin-boy, too, we like. Of course we
are all glad the girl is gone to Venice–for there is no place like
Venice. Now I easily understand that the old man couldn’t go, because
you have a purpose in sending Lyddy by herself: but you could send the
old man over in another ship, and we particularly want him along.
Suppose you don’t need him there? What of that? Can’t you let him feed
the doves? Can’t you let him fall in the canal occasionally? Can’t you
let his good-natured purse be a daily prey to guides and beggar-boys?
Can’t you let him find peace and rest and fellowship under Pere Jacopo’s
kindly wing? (However, you are writing the book, not I–still, I am one
of the people you are writing it for, you understand.) I only want to
insist, in a friendly way, that the old man shall shed his sweet
influence frequently upon the page–that is all.</p>
<p>The first time we called at the convent, Pere Jacopo was absent; the
next (Just at this moment Miss Spaulding spoke up and said something
about Pere Jacopo–there is more in this acting of one mind upon another
than people think) time, he was there, and gave us preserved rose-leaves
to eat, and talked about you, and Mrs. Howells, and Winnie, and brought
out his photographs, and showed us a picture of “the library of your new
house,“ but not so–it was the study in your Cambridge house. He was very
sweet and good. He called on us next day; the day after that we left
Venice, after a pleasant sojourn Of 3 or 4 weeks. He expects to spend
this winter in Munich and will see us often, he said.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, I am going to write something, and when I finish it I
shall know whether to put it to itself or in the “Contributors’ Club.“
That “Contributors’ Club“ was a most happy idea. By the way, I think
that the man who wrote the paragraph beginning at the bottom of page 643
has said a mighty sound and sensible thing. I wish his suggestion could
be adopted.</p>
<p>It is lovely of you to keep that old pipe in such a place of
honor.</p>
<p>While it occurs to me, I must tell you Susie’s last. She is sorely
badgered with dreams; and her stock dream is that she is being eaten up
by bears. She is a grave and thoughtful child, as you will remember.
Last night she had the usual dream. This morning she stood apart (after
telling it,) for some time, looking vacantly at the floor, and absorbed
in meditation. At last she looked up, and with the pathos of one who
feels he has not been dealt by with even-handed fairness, said “But
Mamma, the trouble is, that I am never the bear, but always the
person.“</p>
<p>It would not have occurred to me that there might be an advantage,
even in a dream, in occasionally being the eater, instead of always the
party eaten, but I easily perceived that her point was well taken.</p>
<p>I’m sending to Heidelberg for your letter and Winnie’s, and I do hope
they haven’t been lost.</p>
<p>My wife and I send love to you all. Yrs ever, MARK.</p>
<p>The Howells story, running at this time in the Atlantic, and so much
enjoyed by the Clemens party, was “The Lady of the Aroostook.“ The
suggestions made for enlarging the part of the “old man“ are eminently
characteristic.</p>
<p>Mark Twain’s forty-third birthday came in Munich, and in his letter
conveying this fact to his mother we get a brief added outline of the
daily life in that old Bavarian city. Certainly, it would seem to have
been a quieter and more profitable existence than he had known amid the
confusion of things left behind in, America.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in America:</p>
<p>No. 1a Karlstrasse, Dec. 1, MUNICH. 1878. MY DEAR MOTHER AND
SISTER,–I broke the back of life yesterday and started down-hill toward
old age. This fact has not produced any effect upon me that I can
detect.</p>
<p>I suppose we are located here for the winter. I have a pleasant
work-room a mile from here where I do my writing. The walk to and from
that place gives me what exercise I need, and all I take. We staid three
weeks in Venice, a week in Florence, a fortnight in Rome, and arrived
here a couple of weeks ago. Livy and Miss Spaulding are studying drawing
and German, and the children have a German day-governess. I cannot see
but that the children speak German as well as they do English.</p>
<p>Susie often translates Livy’s orders to the servants. I cannot work
and study German at the same time: so I have dropped the latter, and do
not even read the language, except in the morning paper to get the
news.</p>
<p>We have all pretty good health, latterly, and have seldom had to call
the doctor. The children have been in the open air pretty constantly for
months now. In Venice they were on the water in the gondola most of the
time, and were great friends with our gondolier; and in Rome and
Florence they had long daily tramps, for Rosa is a famous hand to smell
out the sights of a strange place. Here they wander less
extensively.</p>
