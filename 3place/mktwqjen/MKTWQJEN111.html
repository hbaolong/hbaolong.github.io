<h4 id="chapter-xlvi.">CHAPTER XLVI.</h4>
<p>There were nabobs in those days–in the “flush times,“ I mean. Every
rich strike in the mines created one or two. I call to mind several of
these. They were careless, easy-going fellows, as a general thing, and
the community at large was as much benefited by their riches as they
were themselves–possibly more, in some cases.</p>
<p>Two cousins, teamsters, did some hauling for a man and had to take a
small segregated portion of a silver mine in lieu of 00 cash. They gave
an outsider a third to open the mine, and they went on teaming. But not
long. Ten months afterward the mine was out of debt and paying each
owner ,000 to 0,000 a month–say 00,000 a year.</p>
<p>One of the earliest nabobs that Nevada was delivered of wore ,000
worth of diamonds in his bosom, and swore he was unhappy because he
could not spend his money as fast as he made it.</p>
<p>Another Nevada nabob boasted an income that often reached 6,000 a
month; and he used to love to tell how he had worked in the very mine
that yielded it, for five dollars a day, when he first came to the
country.</p>
<p>The silver and sage-brush State has knowledge of another of these
pets of fortune–lifted from actual poverty to affluence almost in a
single night–who was able to offer 00,000 for a position of high
official distinction, shortly afterward, and did offer it–but failed to
get it, his politics not being as sound as his bank account.</p>
<p>Then there was John Smith. He was a good, honest, kind-hearted soul,
born and reared in the lower ranks of life, and miraculously ignorant.
He drove a team, and owned a small ranch–a ranch that paid him a
comfortable living, for although it yielded but little hay, what little
it did yield was worth from 50 to 00 in gold per ton in the market.
Presently Smith traded a few acres of the ranch for a small undeveloped
silver mine in Gold Hill. He opened the mine and built a little
unpretending ten-stamp mill. Eighteen months afterward he retired from
the hay business, for his mining income had reached a most comfortable
figure. Some people said it was 0,000 a month, and others said it was
0,000. Smith was very rich at any rate.</p>
<p>And then he went to Europe and traveled. And when he came back he was
never tired of telling about the fine hogs he had seen in England, and
the gorgeous sheep he had seen in Spain, and the fine cattle he had
noticed in the vicinity of Rome. He was full of wonders of the old
world, and advised everybody to travel. He said a man never imagined
what surprising things there were in the world till he had traveled.</p>
<p>One day, on board ship, the passengers made up a pool of 00, which
was to be the property of the man who should come nearest to guessing
the run of the vessel for the next twenty-four hours. Next day, toward
noon, the figures were all in the purser’s hands in sealed envelopes.
Smith was serene and happy, for he had been bribing the engineer. But
another party won the prize! Smith said:</p>
<p>“Here, that won’t do! He guessed two miles wider of the mark than I
did.“</p>
<p>The purser said, “Mr. Smith, you missed it further than any man on
board. We traveled two hundred and eight miles yesterday.“</p>
<p>“Well, sir,“ said Smith, “that’s just where I’ve got you, for I
guessed two hundred and nine. If you’ll look at my figgers again you’ll
find a 2 and two 0’s, which stands for 200, don’t it?–and after ’em
you’ll find a 9 (2009), which stands for two hundred and nine. I reckon
I’ll take that money, if you please.“</p>
<p>The Gould andandandand Curry claim comprised twelve hundred feet, and
it all belonged originally to the two men whose names it bears.
Mr. Curry owned two thirds of it–and he said that he sold it out for
twenty-five hundred dollars in cash, and an old plug horse that ate up
his market value in hay and barley in seventeen days by the watch. And
he said that Gould sold out for a pair of second-hand government
blankets and a bottle of whisky that killed nine men in three hours, and
that an unoffending stranger that smelt the cork was disabled for life.
Four years afterward the mine thus disposed of was worth in the San
Francisco market seven millions six hundred thousand dollars in gold
coin.</p>
<p>In the early days a poverty-stricken Mexican who lived in a canyon
directly back of Virginia City, had a stream of water as large as a
man’s wrist trickling from the hill-side on his premises. The Ophir
Company segregated a hundred feet of their mine and traded it to him for
the stream of water. The hundred feet proved to be the richest part of
the entire mine; four years after the swap, its market value (including
its mill) was ,500,000.</p>
<p>An individual who owned twenty feet in the Ophir mine before its
great riches were revealed to men, traded it for a horse, and a very
sorry looking brute he was, too. A year or so afterward, when Ophir
stock went up to ,000 a foot, this man, who had not a cent, used to say
he was the most startling example of magnificence and misery the world
had ever seen–because he was able to ride a sixty-thousand-dollar
horse–yet could not scrape up cash enough to buy a saddle, and was
obliged to borrow one or ride bareback. He said if fortune were to give
him another sixty-thousand-dollar horse it would ruin him.</p>
<p>A youth of nineteen, who was a telegraph operator in Virginia on a
salary of a hundred dollars a month, and who, when he could not make out
German names in the list of San Francisco steamer arrivals, used to
ingeniously select and supply substitutes for them out of an old Berlin
city directory, made himself rich by watching the mining telegrams that
passed through his hands and buying and selling stocks accordingly,
through a friend in San Francisco. Once when a private dispatch was sent
from Virginia announcing a rich strike in a prominent mine and advising
that the matter be kept secret till a large amount of the stock could be
secured, he bought forty “feet“ of the stock at twenty dollars a foot,
and afterward sold half of it at eight hundred dollars a foot and the
rest at double that figure. Within three months he was worth 50,000, and
had resigned his telegraphic position.</p>
<p>Another telegraph operator who had been discharged by the company for
divulging the secrets of the office, agreed with a moneyed man in San
Francisco to furnish him the result of a great Virginia mining lawsuit
within an hour after its private reception by the parties to it in San
Francisco. For this he was to have a large percentage of the profits on
purchases and sales made on it by his fellow-conspirator. So he went,
disguised as a teamster, to a little wayside telegraph office in the
mountains, got acquainted with the operator, and sat in the office day
after day, smoking his pipe, complaining that his team was fagged out
and unable to travel–and meantime listening to the dispatches as they
passed clicking through the machine from Virginia. Finally the private
dispatch announcing the result of the lawsuit sped over the wires, and
as soon as he heard it he telegraphed his friend in San Francisco:</p>
<p>“Am tired waiting. Shall sell the team and go home.“</p>
<p>It was the signal agreed upon. The word “waiting“ left out, would
have signified that the suit had gone the other way.</p>
<p>The mock teamster’s friend picked up a deal of the mining stock, at
low figures, before the news became public, and a fortune was the
result.</p>
<p>For a long time after one of the great Virginia mines had been
incorporated, about fifty feet of the original location were still in
the hands of a man who had never signed the incorporation papers. The
stock became very valuable, and every effort was made to find this man,
but he had disappeared. Once it was heard that he was in New York, and
one or two speculators went east but failed to find him. Once the news
came that he was in the Bermudas, and straightway a speculator or two
hurried east and sailed for Bermuda–but he was not there. Finally he was
heard of in Mexico, and a friend of his, a bar-keeper on a salary,
scraped together a little money and sought him out, bought his “feet“
for a hundred dollars, returned and sold the property for 5,000.</p>
<p>But why go on? The traditions of Silverland are filled with instances
like these, and I would never get through enumerating them were I to
attempt do it. I only desired to give, the reader an idea of a
peculiarity of the “flush times“ which I could not present so strikingly
in any other way, and which some mention of was necessary to a realizing
comprehension of the time and the country.</p>
<p>I was personally acquainted with the majority of the nabobs I have
referred to, and so, for old acquaintance sake, I have shifted their
occupations and experiences around in such a way as to keep the Pacific
public from recognizing these once notorious men. No longer notorious,
for the majority of them have drifted back into poverty and obscurity
again.</p>
<p>In Nevada there used to be current the story of an adventure of two
of her nabobs, which may or may not have occurred. I give it for what it
is worth:</p>
<p>Col. Jim had seen somewhat of the world, and knew more or less of its
ways; but Col. Jack was from the back settlements of the States, had led
a life of arduous toil, and had never seen a city. These two, blessed
with sudden wealth, projected a visit to New York,–Col. Jack to see the
sights, and Col. Jim to guard his unsophistication from misfortune. They
reached San Francisco in the night, and sailed in the morning. Arrived
in New York, Col. Jack said:</p>
<p>“I’ve heard tell of carriages all my life, and now I mean to have a
ride in one; I don’t care what it costs. Come along.“</p>
<p>They stepped out on the sidewalk, and Col. Jim called a stylish
barouche. But Col. Jack said:</p>
<p>“No, sir! None of your cheap-John turn-outs for me. I’m here to have
a good time, and money ain’t any object. I mean to have the nobbiest rig
that’s going. Now here comes the very trick. Stop that yaller one with
the pictures on it–don’t you fret–I’ll stand all the expenses
myself.“</p>
<p>So Col. Jim stopped an empty omnibus, and they got in. Said Col.
Jack:</p>
<p>“Ain’t it gay, though? Oh, no, I reckon not! Cushions, and windows,
and pictures, till you can’t rest. What would the boys say if they could
see us cutting a swell like this in New York? By George, I wish they
could see us.“</p>
<p>Then he put his head out of the window, and shouted to the
driver:</p>
<p>“Say, Johnny, this suits me!–suits yours truly, you bet, you! I want
this shebang all day. I’m on it, old man! Let ’em out! Make ’em go!
We’ll make it all right with you, sonny!“</p>
<p>The driver passed his hand through the strap-hole, and tapped for his
fare–it was before the gongs came into common use. Col. Jack took the
hand, and shook it cordially. He said:</p>
<p>“You twig me, old pard! All right between gents. Smell of that, and
see how you like it!“</p>
<p>And he put a twenty-dollar gold piece in the driver’s hand. After a
moment the driver said he could not make change.</p>
<p>“Bother the change! Ride it out. Put it in your pocket.“</p>
<p>Then to Col. Jim, with a sounding slap on his thigh:</p>
<p>“Ain’t it style, though? Hanged if I don’t hire this thing every day
for a week.“</p>
<p>The omnibus stopped, and a young lady got in. Col. Jack stared a
moment, then nudged Col. Jim with his elbow:</p>
<p>“Don’t say a word,“ he whispered. “Let her ride, if she wants to.
Gracious, there’s room enough.“</p>
<p>The young lady got out her porte-monnaie, and handed her fare to Col.
Jack.</p>
<p>“What’s this for?“ said he.</p>
<p>“Give it to the driver, please.“</p>
<p>“Take back your money, madam. We can’t allow it. You’re welcome to
ride here as long as you please, but this shebang’s chartered, and we
can’t let you pay a cent.“</p>
<p>The girl shrunk into a corner, bewildered. An old lady with a basket
climbed in, and proffered her fare.</p>
<p>“Excuse me,“ said Col. Jack. “You’re perfectly welcome here, madam,
but we can’t allow you to pay. Set right down there, mum, and don’t you
be the least uneasy. Make yourself just as free as if you was in your
own turn-out.“</p>
<p>Within two minutes, three gentlemen, two fat women, and a couple of
children, entered.</p>
<p>“Come right along, friends,“ said Col. Jack; “don’t mind us. This is
a free blow-out.“ Then he whispered to Col. Jim,</p>
<p>“New York ain’t no sociable place, I don’t reckon–it ain’t no name
for it!“</p>
<p>He resisted every effort to pass fares to the driver, and made
everybody cordially welcome. The situation dawned on the people, and
they pocketed their money, and delivered themselves up to covert
enjoyment of the episode. Half a dozen more passengers entered.</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s plenty of room,“ said Col. Jack. “Walk right in, and
make yourselves at home. A blow-out ain’t worth anything as a blow-out,
unless a body has company.“ Then in a whisper to Col. Jim: “But ain’t
these New Yorkers friendly? And ain’t they cool about it, too? Icebergs
ain’t anywhere. I reckon they’d tackle a hearse, if it was going their
way.“</p>
<p>More passengers got in; more yet, and still more. Both seats were
filled, and a file of men were standing up, holding on to the cleats
overhead. Parties with baskets and bundles were climbing up on the roof.
Half-suppressed laughter rippled up from all sides.</p>
<p>“Well, for clean, cool, out-and-out cheek, if this don’t bang
anything that ever I saw, I’m an Injun!“ whispered Col. Jack.</p>
<p>A Chinaman crowded his way in.</p>
<p>“I weaken!“ said Col. Jack. “Hold on, driver! Keep your seats,
ladies, and gents. Just make yourselves free–everything’s paid for.
Driver, rustle these folks around as long as they’re a mind to
go–friends of ours, you know. Take them everywheres–and if you want more
money, come to the St. Nicholas, and we’ll make it all right. Pleasant
journey to you, ladies and gents–go it just as long as you please–it
shan’t cost you a cent!“</p>
<p>The two comrades got out, and Col. Jack said:</p>
<p>“Jimmy, it’s the sociablest place I ever saw. The Chinaman waltzed in
as comfortable as anybody. If we’d staid awhile, I reckon we’d had some
niggers. B’ George, we’ll have to barricade our doors to-night, or some
of these ducks will be trying to sleep with us.“</p>
