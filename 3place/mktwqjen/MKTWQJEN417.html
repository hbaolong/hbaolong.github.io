<h4 id="chapter-34-tough-yarns">Chapter 34 Tough Yarns</h4>
<p>STACK ISLAND. I remembered Stack Island; also Lake Providence,
Louisiana–which is the first distinctly Southern-looking town you come
to, downward-bound; lies level and low, shade-trees hung with venerable
gray beards of Spanish moss; ‘restful, pensive, Sunday aspect about the
place,’ comments Uncle Mumford, with feeling–also with truth.</p>
<p>A Mr. H. furnished some minor details of fact concerning this region
which I would have hesitated to believe if I had not known him to be a
steamboat mate. He was a passenger of ours, a resident of Arkansas City,
and bound to Vicksburg to join his boat, a little Sunflower packet. He
was an austere man, and had the reputation of being singularly
unworldly, for a river man. Among other things, he said that Arkansas
had been injured and kept back by generations of exaggerations
concerning the mosquitoes here. One may smile, said he, and turn the
matter off as being a small thing; but when you come to look at the
effects produced, in the way of discouragement of immigration, and
diminished values of property, it was quite the opposite of a small
thing, or thing in any wise to be coughed down or sneered at. These
mosquitoes had been persistently represented as being formidable and
lawless; whereas ‘the truth is, they are feeble, insignificant in size,
diffident to a fault, sensitive’–and so on, and so on; you would have
supposed he was talking about his family. But if he was soft on the
Arkansas mosquitoes, he was hard enough on the mosquitoes of Lake
Providence to make up for it–‘those Lake Providence colossi,’ as he
finely called them. He said that two of them could whip a dog, and that
four of them could hold a man down; and except help come, they would
kill him–‘butcher him,’ as he expressed it. Referred in a sort of casual
way–and yet significant way–to ‘the fact that the life policy in its
simplest form is unknown in Lake Providence–they take out a mosquito
policy besides.’ He told many remarkable things about those lawless
insects. Among others, said he had seen them try to vote. Noticing that
this statement seemed to be a good deal of a strain on us, he modified
it a little: said he might have been mistaken, as to that particular,
but knew he had seen them around the polls ‘canvassing.’</p>
<p>There was another passenger–friend of H.’s–who backed up the harsh
evidence against those mosquitoes, and detailed some stirring adventures
which he had had with them. The stories were pretty sizable, merely
pretty sizable; yet Mr. H. was continually interrupting with a cold,
inexorable ‘Wait–knock off twenty-five per cent. of that; now go on;’
or, ‘Wait–you are getting that too strong; cut it down, cut it down– you
get a leetle too much costumery on to your statements: always dress a
fact in tights, never in an ulster;’ or, ‘Pardon, once more: if you are
going to load anything more on to that statement, you want to get a
couple of lighters and tow the rest, because it’s drawing all the water
there is in the river already; stick to facts–just stick to the cold
facts; what these gentlemen want for a book is the frozen truth–ain’t
that so, gentlemen?’ He explained privately that it was necessary to
watch this man all the time, and keep him within bounds; it would not do
to neglect this precaution, as he, Mr. H., ‘knew to his sorrow.’ Said
he, ‘I will not deceive you; he told me such a monstrous lie once, that
it swelled my left ear up, and spread it so that I was actually not able
to see out around it; it remained so for months, and people came miles
to see me fan myself with it.’</p>
