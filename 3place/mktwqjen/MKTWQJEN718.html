<h4 id="chapter-xxxiii.">CHAPTER XXXIII.</h4>
<p>Let us be grateful to Adam our benefactor. He cut us out of the
“blessing of idleness,“ and won for us the “curse of labor.“ –Pudd’nhead
Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>We soon reached the town of Nelson, and spent the most of the day
there, visiting acquaintances and driving with them about the garden–the
whole region is a garden, excepting the scene of the “Maungatapu
Murders,“ of thirty years ago. That is a wild place–wild and lonely; an
ideal place for a murder. It is at the base of a vast, rugged, densely
timbered mountain. In the deep twilight of that forest solitude four
desperate rascals–Burgess, Sullivan, Levy, and Kelley–ambushed
themselves beside the mountain-trail to murder and rob four
travelers–Kempthorne, Mathieu, Dudley, and De Pontius, the latter a New
Yorker. A harmless old laboring man came wandering along, and as his
presence was an embarrassment, they choked him, hid him, and then
resumed their watch for the four. They had to wait a while, but
eventually everything turned out as they desired.</p>
<p>That dark episode is the one large event in the history of Nelson.
The fame of it traveled far. Burgess made a confession. It is a
remarkable paper. For brevity, succinctness, and concentration, it is
perhaps without its peer in the literature of murder. There are no waste
words in it; there is no obtrusion of matter not pertinent to the
occasion, nor any departure from the dispassionate tone proper to a
formal business statement–for that is what it is: a business statement
of a murder, by the chief engineer of it, or superintendent, or foreman,
or whatever one may prefer to call him.</p>
<p>“We were getting impatient, when we saw four men and a pack-horse
coming. I left my cover and had a look at the men, for Levy had told me
that Mathieu was a small man and wore a large beard, and that it was a
chestnut horse. I said, ‘Here they come.’ They were then a good distance
away; I took the caps off my gun, and put fresh ones on. I said, ‘You
keep where you are, I’ll put them up, and you give me your gun while you
tie them.’ It was arranged as I have described. The men came; they
arrived within about fifteen yards when I stepped up and said, ‘Stand!
bail up!’ That means all of them to get together. I made them fall back
on the upper side of the road with their faces up the range, and
Sullivan brought me his gun, and then tied their hands behind them. The
horse was very quiet all the time, he did not move. When they were all
tied, Sullivan took the horse up the hill, and put him in the bush; he
cut the rope and let the swags–[A “swag“ is a kit, a pack, small
baggage.]–fall on the ground, and then came to me. We then marched the
men down the incline to the creek; the water at this time barely
running. Up this creek we took the men; we went, I daresay, five or six
hundred yards up it, which took us nearly half-an-hour to accomplish.
Then we turned to the right up the range; we went, I daresay, one
hundred and fifty yards from the creek, and there we sat down with the
men. I said to Sullivan, ‘Put down your gun and search these men,’ which
he did. I asked them their several names; they told me. I asked them if
they were expected at Nelson. They said, ‘No.’ If such their lives would
have been spared. In money we took L60 odd. I said, ‘Is this all you
have? You had better tell me.’ Sullivan said, ‘Here is a bag of gold.’ I
said, ‘What’s on that pack-horse? Is there any gold ?’ when Kempthorne
said, ‘Yes, my gold is in the portmanteau, and I trust you will not take
it all.’ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘we must take you away one at a time, because
the range is steep just here, and then we will let you go.’ They said,
‘All right,’ most cheerfully. We tied their feet, and took Dudley with
us; we went about sixty yards with him. This was through a scrub. It was
arranged the night previously that it would be best to choke them, in
case the report of the arms might be heard from the road, and if they
were missed they never would be found. So we tied a handkerchief over
his eyes, when Sullivan took the sash off his waist, put it round his
neck, and so strangled him. Sullivan, after I had killed the old
laboring man, found fault with the way he was choked. He said, ‘The next
we do I’ll show you my way.’ I said, ‘I have never done such a thing
before. I have shot a man, but never choked one.’ We returned to the
others, when Kempthorne said, ‘What noise was that?’ I said it was
caused by breaking through the scrub. This was taking too much time, so
it was agreed to shoot them. With that I said, ‘We’ll take you no
further, but separate you, and then loose one of you, and he can relieve
the others.’ So with that, Sullivan took De Pontius to the left of where
Kempthorne was sitting. I took Mathieu to the right. I tied a strap
round his legs, and shot him with a revolver. He yelled, I ran from him
with my gun in my hand, I sighted Kempthorne, who had risen to his feet.
I presented the gun, and shot him behind the right ear; his life’s blood
welled from him, and he died instantaneously. Sullivan had shot. De
Pontius in the meantime, and then came to me. I said, ‘Look to Mathieu,’
indicating the spot where he lay. He shortly returned and said, ‘I had
to “chiv“ that fellow, he was not dead,’ a cant word, meaning that he
had to stab him. Returning to the road we passed where De Pontius lay
and was dead. Sullivan said, ‘This is the digger, the others were all
storekeepers; this is the digger, let’s cover him up, for should the
others be found, they’ll think he done it and sloped,’ meaning he had
gone. So with that we threw all the stones on him, and then left him.
This bloody work took nearly an hour and a half from the time we stopped
the men.“</p>
<p>Anyone who reads that confession will think that the man who wrote it
was destitute of emotions, destitute of feeling. That is partly true. As
regarded others he was plainly without feeling–utterly cold and
pitiless; but as regarded himself the case was different. While he cared
nothing for the future of the murdered men, he cared a great deal for
his own. It makes one’s flesh creep to read the introduction to his
confession. The judge on the bench characterized it as “scandalously
blasphemous,“ and it certainly reads so, but Burgess meant no blasphemy.
He was merely a brute, and whatever he said or wrote was sure to expose
the fact. His redemption was a very real thing to him, and he was as
jubilantly happy on the gallows as ever was Christian martyr at the
stake. We dwellers in this world are strangely made, and mysteriously
circumstanced. We have to suppose that the murdered men are lost, and
that Burgess is saved; but we cannot suppress our natural regrets.</p>
<p>“Written in my dungeon drear this 7th of August, in the year of
Grace, 1866. To God be ascribed all power and glory in subduing the
rebellious spirit of a most guilty wretch, who has been brought, through
the instrumentality of a faithful follower of Christ, to see his
wretched and guilty state, inasmuch as hitherto he has led an awful and
wretched life, and through the assurance of this faithful soldier of
Christ, he has been led and also believes that Christ will yet receive
and cleanse him from all his deep-dyed and bloody sins. I lie under the
imputation which says, ‘Come now and let us reason together, saith the
Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.’ On this promise
I rely.“</p>
<p>We sailed in the afternoon late, spent a few hours at New Plymouth,
then sailed again and reached Auckland the next day, November 20th, and
remained in that fine city several days. Its situation is commanding,
and the sea-view is superb. There are charming drives all about, and by
courtesy of friends we had opportunity to enjoy them. From the grassy
crater-summit of Mount Eden one’s eye ranges over a grand sweep and
variety of scenery–forests clothed in luxuriant foliage, rolling green
fields, conflagrations of flowers, receding and dimming stretches of
green plain, broken by lofty and symmetrical old craters–then the blue
bays twinkling and sparkling away into the dreamy distances where the
mountains loom spiritual in their veils of haze.</p>
<p>It is from Auckland that one goes to Rotorua, the region of the
renowned hot lakes and geysers–one of the chief wonders of New Zealand;
but I was not well enough to make the trip. The government has a
sanitorium there, and everything is comfortable for the tourist and the
invalid. The government’s official physician is almost over-cautious in
his estimates of the efficacy of the baths, when he is talking about
rheumatism, gout, paralysis, and such things; but when he is talking
about the effectiveness of the waters in eradicating the whisky-habit,
he seems to have no reserves. The baths will cure the drinking-habit no
matter how chronic it is–and cure it so effectually that even the desire
to drink intoxicants will come no more. There should be a rush from
Europe and America to that place; and when the victims of alcoholism
find out what they can get by going there, the rush will begin.</p>
<p>The Thermal-springs District of New Zealand comprises an area of
upwards of 600,000 acres, or close on 1,000 square miles. Rotorua is the
favorite place. It is the center of a rich field of lake and mountain
scenery; from Rotorua as a base the pleasure-seeker makes excursions.
The crowd of sick people is great, and growing. Rotorua is the Carlsbad
of Australasia.</p>
<p>It is from Auckland that the Kauri gum is shipped. For a long time
now about 8,000 tons of it have been brought into the town per year. It
is worth about 00 per ton, unassorted; assorted, the finest grades are
worth about ,000. It goes to America, chiefly. It is in lumps, and is
hard and smooth, and looks like amber–the light-colored like new amber,
and the dark brown like rich old amber. And it has the pleasant feel of
amber, too. Some of the light-colored samples were a tolerably fair
counterfeit of uncut South African diamonds, they were so perfectly
smooth and polished and transparent. It is manufactured into varnish; a
varnish which answers for copal varnish and is cheaper.</p>
<p>The gum is dug up out of the ground; it has been there for ages. It
is the sap of the Kauri tree. Dr. Campbell of Auckland told me he sent a
cargo of it to England fifty years ago, but nothing came of the venture.
Nobody knew what to do with it; so it was sold at 15 a ton, to light
fires with.</p>
<p>November 26–3 P.M., sailed. Vast and beautiful harbor. Land all about
for hours. Tangariwa, the mountain that “has the same shape from every
point of view.“ That is the common belief in Auckland. And so it has
–from every point of view except thirteen. Perfect summer weather. Large
school of whales in the distance. Nothing could be daintier than the
puffs of vapor they spout up, when seen against the pink glory of the
sinking sun, or against the dark mass of an island reposing in the deep
blue shadow of a storm cloud . . . . Great Barrier rock standing up out
of the sea away to the left. Sometime ago a ship hit it full speed in a
fog–20 miles out of her course–140 lives lost; the captain committed
suicide without waiting a moment. He knew that, whether he was to blame
or not, the company owning the vessel would discharge him and make a
devotion–to–passengers’ safety advertisement out of it, and his chance
to make a livelihood would be permanently gone.</p>
