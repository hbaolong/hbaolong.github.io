<h4 id="chapter-lii.">CHAPTER LII.</h4>
<p>The narrow canon in which Nablous, or Shechem, is situated, is under
high cultivation, and the soil is exceedingly black and fertile. It is
well watered, and its affluent vegetation gains effect by contrast with
the barren hills that tower on either side. One of these hills is the
ancient Mount of Blessings and the other the Mount of Curses and wise
men who seek for fulfillments of prophecy think they find here a wonder
of this kind–to wit, that the Mount of Blessings is strangely fertile
and its mate as strangely unproductive. We could not see that there was
really much difference between them in this respect, however.</p>
<p>Shechem is distinguished as one of the residences of the patriarch
Jacob, and as the seat of those tribes that cut themselves loose from
their brethren of Israel and propagated doctrines not in conformity with
those of the original Jewish creed. For thousands of years this clan
have dwelt in Shechem under strict tabu, and having little commerce or
fellowship with their fellow men of any religion or nationality. For
generations they have not numbered more than one or two hundred, but
they still adhere to their ancient faith and maintain their ancient
rites and ceremonies. Talk of family and old descent! Princes and nobles
pride themselves upon lineages they can trace back some hundreds of
years. What is this trifle to this handful of old first families of
Shechem who can name their fathers straight back without a flaw for
thousands –straight back to a period so remote that men reared in a
country where the days of two hundred years ago are called “ancient“
times grow dazed and bewildered when they try to comprehend it! Here is
respectability for you–here is “family“–here is high descent worth
talking about. This sad, proud remnant of a once mighty community still
hold themselves aloof from all the world; they still live as their
fathers lived, labor as their fathers labored, think as they did, feel
as they did, worship in the same place, in sight of the same landmarks,
and in the same quaint, patriarchal way their ancestors did more than
thirty centuries ago. I found myself gazing at any straggling scion of
this strange race with a riveted fascination, just as one would stare at
a living mastodon, or a megatherium that had moved in the grey dawn of
creation and seen the wonders of that mysterious world that was before
the flood.</p>
<p>Carefully preserved among the sacred archives of this curious
community is a MSS. copy of the ancient Jewish law, which is said to be
the oldest document on earth. It is written on vellum, and is some four
or five thousand years old. Nothing but bucksheesh can purchase a sight.
Its fame is somewhat dimmed in these latter days, because of the doubts
so many authors of Palestine travels have felt themselves privileged to
cast upon it. Speaking of this MSS. reminds me that I procured from the
high-priest of this ancient Samaritan community, at great expense, a
secret document of still higher antiquity and far more extraordinary
interest, which I propose to publish as soon as I have finished
translating it.</p>
<p>Joshua gave his dying injunction to the children of Israel at
Shechem, and buried a valuable treasure secretly under an oak tree there
about the same time. The superstitious Samaritans have always been
afraid to hunt for it. They believe it is guarded by fierce spirits
invisible to men.</p>
<p>About a mile and a half from Shechem we halted at the base of Mount
Ebal before a little square area, inclosed by a high stone wall, neatly
whitewashed. Across one end of this inclosure is a tomb built after the
manner of the Moslems. It is the tomb of Joseph. No truth is better
authenticated than this.</p>
<p>When Joseph was dying he prophesied that exodus of the Israelites
from Egypt which occurred four hundred years afterwards. At the same
time he exacted of his people an oath that when they journeyed to the
land of Canaan they would bear his bones with them and bury them in the
ancient inheritance of his fathers. The oath was kept. “And the bones of
Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried
they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of
Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver.“</p>
<p>Few tombs on earth command the veneration of so many races and men of
divers creeds as this of Joseph. “Samaritan and Jew, Moslem and
Christian alike, revere it, and honor it with their visits. The tomb of
Joseph, the dutiful son, the affectionate, forgiving brother, the
virtuous man, the wise Prince and ruler. Egypt felt his influence–the
world knows his history.“</p>
<p>In this same “parcel of ground“ which Jacob bought of the sons of
Hamor for a hundred pieces of silver, is Jacob’s celebrated well. It is
cut in the solid rock, and is nine feet square and ninety feet deep. The
name of this unpretending hole in the ground, which one might pass by
and take no notice of, is as familiar as household words to even the
children and the peasants of many a far-off country. It is more famous
than the Parthenon; it is older than the Pyramids.</p>
<p>It was by this well that Jesus sat and talked with a woman of that
strange, antiquated Samaritan community I have been speaking of, and
told her of the mysterious water of life. As descendants of old English
nobles still cherish in the traditions of their houses how that this
king or that king tarried a day with some favored ancestor three hundred
years ago, no doubt the descendants of the woman of Samaria, living
there in Shechem, still refer with pardonable vanity to this
conversation of their ancestor, held some little time gone by, with the
Messiah of the Christians. It is not likely that they undervalue a
distinction such as this. Samaritan nature is human nature, and human
nature remembers contact with the illustrious, always.</p>
<p>For an offense done to the family honor, the sons of Jacob
exterminated all Shechem once.</p>
<p>We left Jacob’s Well and traveled till eight in the evening, but
rather slowly, for we had been in the saddle nineteen hours, and the
horses were cruelly tired. We got so far ahead of the tents that we had
to camp in an Arab village, and sleep on the ground. We could have slept
in the largest of the houses; but there were some little drawbacks: it
was populous with vermin, it had a dirt floor, it was in no respect
cleanly, and there was a family of goats in the only bedroom, and two
donkeys in the parlor. Outside there were no inconveniences, except that
the dusky, ragged, earnest-eyed villagers of both sexes and all ages
grouped themselves on their haunches all around us, and discussed us and
criticised us with noisy tongues till midnight. We did not mind the
noise, being tired, but, doubtless, the reader is aware that it is
almost an impossible thing to go to sleep when you know that people are
looking at you. We went to bed at ten, and got up again at two and
started once more. Thus are people persecuted by dragomen, whose sole
ambition in life is to get ahead of each other.</p>
<p>About daylight we passed Shiloh, where the Ark of the Covenant rested
three hundred years, and at whose gates good old Eli fell down and
“brake his neck“ when the messenger, riding hard from the battle, told
him of the defeat of his people, the death of his sons, and, more than
all, the capture of Israel’s pride, her hope, her refuge, the ancient
Ark her forefathers brought with them out of Egypt. It is little wonder
that under circumstances like these he fell down and brake his neck. But
Shiloh had no charms for us. We were so cold that there was no comfort
but in motion, and so drowsy we could hardly sit upon the horses.</p>
<p>After a while we came to a shapeless mass of ruins, which still bears
the name of Bethel. It was here that Jacob lay down and had that superb
vision of angels flitting up and down a ladder that reached from the
clouds to earth, and caught glimpses of their blessed home through the
open gates of Heaven.</p>
<p>The pilgrims took what was left of the hallowed ruin, and we pressed
on toward the goal of our crusade, renowned Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The further we went the hotter the sun got, and the more rocky and
bare, repulsive and dreary the landscape became. There could not have
been more fragments of stone strewn broadcast over this part of the
world, if every ten square feet of the land had been occupied by a
separate and distinct stonecutter’s establishment for an age. There was
hardly a tree or a shrub any where. Even the olive and the cactus, those
fast friends of a worthless soil, had almost deserted the country. No
landscape exists that is more tiresome to the eye than that which bounds
the approaches to Jerusalem. The only difference between the roads and
the surrounding country, perhaps, is that there are rather more rocks in
the roads than in the surrounding country.</p>
<p>We passed Ramah, and Beroth, and on the right saw the tomb of the
prophet Samuel, perched high upon a commanding eminence. Still no
Jerusalem came in sight. We hurried on impatiently. We halted a moment
at the ancient Fountain of Beira, but its stones, worn deeply by the
chins of thirsty animals that are dead and gone centuries ago, had no
interest for us–we longed to see Jerusalem. We spurred up hill after
hill, and usually began to stretch our necks minutes before we got to
the top–but disappointment always followed:–more stupid hills
beyond–more unsightly landscape–no Holy City.</p>
<p>At last, away in the middle of the day, ancient bite of wall and
crumbling arches began to line the way–we toiled up one more hill, and
every pilgrim and every sinner swung his hat on high! Jerusalem!</p>
<p>Perched on its eternal hills, white and domed and solid, massed
together and hooped with high gray walls, the venerable city gleamed in
the sun. So small! Why, it was no larger than an American village of
four thousand inhabitants, and no larger than an ordinary Syrian city of
thirty thousand. Jerusalem numbers only fourteen thousand people.</p>
<p>We dismounted and looked, without speaking a dozen sentences, across
the wide intervening valley for an hour or more; and noted those
prominent features of the city that pictures make familiar to all men
from their school days till their death. We could recognize the Tower of
Hippicus, the Mosque of Omar, the Damascus Gate, the Mount of Olives,
the Valley of Jehoshaphat, the Tower of David, and the Garden of
Gethsemane–and dating from these landmarks could tell very nearly the
localities of many others we were not able to distinguish.</p>
<p>I record it here as a notable but not discreditable fact that not
even our pilgrims wept. I think there was no individual in the party
whose brain was not teeming with thoughts and images and memories
invoked by the grand history of the venerable city that lay before us,
but still among them all was no “voice of them that wept.“</p>
<p>There was no call for tears. Tears would have been out of place. The
thoughts Jerusalem suggests are full of poetry, sublimity, and more than
all, dignity. Such thoughts do not find their appropriate expression in
the emotions of the nursery.</p>
<p>Just after noon we entered these narrow, crooked streets, by the
ancient and the famed Damascus Gate, and now for several hours I have
been trying to comprehend that I am actually in the illustrious old city
where Solomon dwelt, where Abraham held converse with the Deity, and
where walls still stand that witnessed the spectacle of the
Crucifixion.</p>
