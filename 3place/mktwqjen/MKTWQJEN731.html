<h4 id="chapter-xlvi.">CHAPTER XLVI.</h4>
<p>If the desire to kill and the opportunity to kill came always
together, who would escape hanging. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New
Calendar.</p>
<p>On the Train. Fifty years ago, when I was a boy in the then remote
and sparsely peopled Mississippi valley, vague tales and rumors of a
mysterious body of professional murderers came wandering in from a
country which was constructively as far from us as the constellations
blinking in space–India; vague tales and rumors of a sect called Thugs,
who waylaid travelers in lonely places and killed them for the
contentment of a god whom they worshiped; tales which everybody liked to
listen to and nobody believed, except with reservations. It was
considered that the stories had gathered bulk on their travels. The
matter died down and a lull followed. Then Eugene Sue’s “Wandering Jew“
appeared, and made great talk for a while. One character in it was a
chief of Thugs–“Feringhea“–a mysterious and terrible Indian who was as
slippery and sly as a serpent, and as deadly; and he stirred up the Thug
interest once more. But it did not last. It presently died again this
time to stay dead.</p>
<p>At first glance it seems strange that this should have happened; but
really it was not strange–on the contrary,. it was natural; I mean on
our side of the water. For the source whence the Thug tales mainly came
was a Government Report, and without doubt was not republished in
America; it was probably never even seen there. Government Reports have
no general circulation. They are distributed to the few, and are not
always read by those few. I heard of this Report for the first time a
day or two ago, and borrowed it. It is full of fascinations; and it
turns those dim, dark fairy tales of my boyhood days into realities.</p>
<p>The Report was made in 1889 by Major Sleeman, of the Indian Service,
and was printed in Calcutta in 1840. It is a clumsy, great, fat, poor
sample of the printer’s art, but good enough for a government
printing-office in that old day and in that remote region, perhaps. To
Major Sleeman was given the general superintendence of the giant task of
ridding India of Thuggee, and he and his seventeen assistants
accomplished it. It was the Augean Stables over again. Captain
Vallancey, writing in a Madras journal in those old times, makes this
remark:</p>
<p>“The day that sees this far-spread evil eradicated from India and
known only in name, will greatly tend to immortalize British rule in the
East.“</p>
<p>He did not overestimate the magnitude and difficulty of the work, nor
the immensity of the credit which would justly be due to British rule in
case it was accomplished.</p>
<p>Thuggee became known to the British authorities in India about 1810,
but its wide prevalence was not suspected; it was not regarded as a
serious matter, and no systematic measures were taken for its
suppression until about 1830. About that time Major Sleeman captured
Eugene Sue’s Thug-chief, “Feringhea,“ and got him to turn King’s
evidence. The revelations were so stupefying that Sleeman was not able
to believe them. Sleeman thought he knew every criminal within his
jurisdiction, and that the worst of them were merely thieves; but
Feringhea told him that he was in reality living in the midst of a swarm
of professional murderers; that they had been all about him for many
years, and that they buried their dead close by. These seemed insane
tales; but Feringhea said come and see–and he took him to a grave and
dug up a hundred bodies, and told him all the circumstances of the
killings, and named the Thugs who had done the work. It was a staggering
business. Sleeman captured some of these Thugs and proceeded to examine
them separately, and with proper precautions against collusion; for he
would not believe any Indian’s unsupported word. The evidence gathered
proved the truth of what Feringhea had said, and also revealed the fact
that gangs of Thugs were plying their trade all over India. The
astonished government now took hold of Thuggee, and for ten years made
systematic and relentless war upon it, and finally destroyed it. Gang
after gang was captured, tried, and punished. The Thugs were harried and
hunted from one end of India to the other. The government got all their
secrets out of them; and also got the names of the members of the bands,
and recorded them in a book, together with their birthplaces and places
of residence.</p>
<p>The Thugs were worshipers of Bhowanee; and to this god they
sacrificed anybody that came handy; but they kept the dead man’s things
themselves, for the god cared for nothing but the corpse. Men were
initiated into the sect with solemn ceremonies. Then they were taught
how to strangle a person with the sacred choke-cloth, but were not
allowed to perform officially with it until after long practice. No
half-educated strangler could choke a man to death quickly enough to
keep him from uttering a sound–a muffled scream, gurgle, gasp, moan, or
something of the sort; but the expert’s work was instantaneous: the
cloth was whipped around the victim’s neck, there was a sudden twist,
and the head fell silently forward, the eyes starting from the sockets;
and all was over. The Thug carefully guarded against resistance. It was
usual to to get the victims to sit down, for that was the handiest
position for business.</p>
<p>If the Thug had planned India itself it could not have been more
conveniently arranged for the needs of his occupation.</p>
<p>There were no public conveyances. There were no conveyances for hire.
The traveler went on foot or in a bullock cart or on a horse which he
bought for the purpose. As soon as he was out of his own little State or
principality he was among strangers; nobody knew him, nobody took note
of him, and from that time his movements could no longer be traced. He
did not stop in towns or villages, but camped outside of them and sent
his servants in to buy provisions. There were no habitations between
villages. Whenever he was between villages he was an easy prey,
particularly as he usually traveled by night, to avoid the heat. He was
always being overtaken by strangers who offered him the protection of
their company, or asked for the protection of his–and these strangers
were often Thugs, as he presently found out to his cost. The
landholders, the native police, the petty princes, the village
officials, the customs officers were in many cases protectors and
harborers of the Thugs, and betrayed travelers to them for a share of
the spoil. At first this condition of things made it next to impossible
for the government to catch the marauders; they were spirited away by
these watchful friends. All through a vast continent, thus infested,
helpless people of every caste and kind moved along the paths and trails
in couples and groups silently by night, carrying the commerce of the
country–treasure, jewels, money, and petty batches of silks, spices, and
all manner of wares. It was a paradise for the Thug.</p>
<p>When the autumn opened, the Thugs began to gather together by
pre-concert. Other people had to have interpreters at every turn, but
not the Thugs; they could talk together, no matter how far apart they
were born, for they had a language of their own, and they had secret
signs by which they knew each other for Thugs; and they were always
friends. Even their diversities of religion and caste were sunk in
devotion to their calling, and the Moslem and the high-caste and
low-caste Hindoo were staunch and affectionate brothers in Thuggery.</p>
<p>When a gang had been assembled, they had religious worship, and
waited for an omen. They had definite notions about the omens. The cries
of certain animals were good omens, the cries of certain other creatures
were bad omens. A bad omen would stop proceedings and send the men
home.</p>
<p>The sword and the strangling-cloth were sacred emblems. The Thugs
worshiped the sword at home before going out to the assembling-place;
the strangling-cloth was worshiped at the place of assembly. The chiefs
of most of the bands performed the religious ceremonies themselves; but
the Kaets delegated them to certain official stranglers (Chaurs). The
rites of the Kaets were so holy that no one but the Chaur was allowed to
touch the vessels and other things used in them.</p>
<p>Thug methods exhibit a curious mixture of caution and the absence of
it; cold business calculation and sudden, unreflecting impulse; but
there were two details which were constant, and not subject to caprice:
patient persistence in following up the prey, and pitilessness when the
time came to act.</p>
<p>Caution was exhibited in the strength of the bands. They never felt
comfortable and confident unless their strength exceeded that of any
party of travelers they were likely to meet by four or fivefold. Yet it
was never their purpose to attack openly, but only when the victims were
off their guard. When they got hold of a party of travelers they often
moved along in their company several days, using all manner of arts to
win their friendship and get their confidence. At last, when this was
accomplished to their satisfaction, the real business began. A few Thugs
were privately detached and sent forward in the dark to select a good
killing-place and dig the graves. When the rest reached the spot a halt
was called, for a rest or a smoke. The travelers were invited to sit. By
signs, the chief appointed certain Thugs to sit down in front of the
travelers as if to wait upon them, others to sit down beside them and
engage them in conversation, and certain expert stranglers to stand
behind the travelers and be ready when the signal was given. The signal
was usually some commonplace remark, like “Bring the tobacco.“ Sometimes
a considerable wait ensued after all the actors were in their places–the
chief was biding his time, in order to make everything sure. Meantime,
the talk droned on, dim figures moved about in the dull light, peace and
tranquility reigned, the travelers resigned themselves to the pleasant
reposefulness and comfort of the situation, unconscious of the
death-angels standing motionless at their backs. The time was ripe, now,
and the signal came: “Bring the tobacco.“ There was a mute swift
movement, all in the same instant the men at each victim’s sides seized
his hands, the man in front seized his feet, and pulled, the man at his
back whipped the cloth around his neck and gave it a twist the head sunk
forward, the tragedy was over. The bodies were stripped and covered up
in the graves, the spoil packed for transportation, then the Thugs gave
pious thanks to Bhowanee, and departed on further holy service.</p>
<p>The Report shows that the travelers moved in exceedingly small groups
–twos, threes, fours, as a rule; a party with a dozen in it was rare.
The Thugs themselves seem to have been the only people who moved in
force. They went about in gangs of 10, 15, 25, 40, 60, 100, 150, 200,
250, and one gang of 310 is mentioned. Considering their numbers, their
catch was not extraordinary–particularly when you consider that they
were not in the least fastidious, but took anybody they could get,
whether rich or poor, and sometimes even killed children. Now and then
they killed women, but it was considered sinful to do it, and unlucky.
The “season“ was six or eight months long. One season the half dozen
Bundelkand and Gwalior gangs aggregated 712 men, and they murdered 210
people. One season the Malwa and Kandeish gangs aggregated 702 men, and
they murdered 232. One season the Kandeish and Berar gangs aggregated
963 men, and they murdered 385 people.</p>
<p>Here is the tally-sheet of a gang of sixty Thugs for a whole
season–gang under two noted chiefs, “Chotee and Sheik Nungoo from
Gwalior“:</p>
<p>“Left Poora, in Jhansee, and on arrival at Sarora murdered a
traveler.</p>
<p>“On nearly reaching Bhopal, met 3 Brahmins, and murdered them.</p>
<p>“Cross the Nerbudda; at a village called Hutteea, murdered a
Hindoo.</p>
<p>“Went through Aurungabad to Walagow; there met a Havildar of the
barber caste and 5 sepoys (native soldiers); in the evening came to
Jokur, and in the morning killed them near the place where the
treasure-bearers were killed the year before.</p>
<p>“Between Jokur and Dholeea met a sepoy of the shepherd caste; killed
him in the jungle.</p>
<p>“Passed through Dholeea and lodged in a village; two miles beyond, on
the road to Indore, met a Byragee (beggar-holy mendicant); murdered him
at the Thapa.</p>
<p>“In the morning, beyond the Thapa, fell in with 3 Marwarie travelers;
murdered them.</p>
<p>“Near a village on the banks of the Taptee met 4 travelers and killed
them.</p>
<p>“Between Choupra and Dhoreea met a Marwarie; murdered him.</p>
<p>“At Dhoreea met 3 Marwaries; took them two miles and murdered
them.</p>
<p>“Two miles further on, overtaken by three treasure-bearers; took them
two miles and murdered them in the jungle.</p>
<p>“Came on to Khurgore Bateesa in Indore, divided spoil, and
dispersed.</p>
<p>“A total of 27 men murdered on one expedition.“</p>
<p>Chotee (to save his neck) was informer, and furnished these facts.
Several things are noticeable about his resume. 1. Business brevity; 2,
absence of emotion; 3, smallness of the parties encountered by the 60;
4, variety in character and quality of the game captured; 5, Hindoo and
Mohammedan chiefs in business together for Bhowanee; 6, the sacred caste
of the Brahmins not respected by either; 7, nor yet the character of
that mendicant, that Byragee.</p>
<p>A beggar is a holy creature, and some of the gangs spared him on that
account, no matter how slack business might be; but other gangs
slaughtered not only him, but even that sacredest of sacred creatures,
the fakeer–that repulsive skin-and-bone thing that goes around naked and
mats his bushy hair with dust and dirt, and so beflours his lean body
with ashes that he looks like a specter. Sometimes a fakeer trusted a
shade too far in the protection of his sacredness. In the middle of a
tally-sheet of Feringhea’s, who had been out with forty Thugs, I find a
case of the kind. After the killing of thirty-nine men and one woman,
the fakeer appears on the scene:</p>
<p>“Approaching Doregow, met 3 pundits; also a fakeer, mounted on a
pony; he was plastered over with sugar to collect flies, and was covered
with them. Drove off the fakeer, and killed the other three.</p>
<p>“Leaving Doregow, the fakeer joined again, and went on in company to
Raojana; met 6 Khutries on their way from Bombay to Nagpore. Drove off
the fakeer with stones, and killed the 6 men in camp, and buried them in
the grove.</p>
<p>“Next day the fakeer joined again; made him leave at Mana. Beyond
there, fell in with two Kahars and a sepoy, and came on towards the
place selected for the murder. When near it, the fakeer came again.
Losing all patience with him, gave Mithoo, one of the gang, 5 rupees
(.50) to murder him, and take the sin upon himself. All four were
strangled, including the fakeer. Surprised to find among the fakeer’s
effects 30 pounds of coral, 350 strings of small pearls, 15 strings of
large pearls, and a gilt necklace.“</p>
<p>It it curious, the little effect that time has upon a really
interesting circumstance. This one, so old, so long ago gone down into
oblivion, reads with the same freshness and charm that attach to the
news in the morning paper; one’s spirits go up, then down, then up
again, following the chances which the fakeer is running; now you hope,
now you despair, now you hope again; and at last everything comes out
right, and you feel a great wave of personal satisfaction go weltering
through you, and without thinking, you put out your hand to pat Mithoo
on the back, when –puff! the whole thing has vanished away, there is
nothing there; Mithoo and all the crowd have been dust and ashes and
forgotten, oh, so many, many, many lagging years! And then comes a sense
of injury: you don’t know whether Mithoo got the swag, along with the
sin, or had to divide up the swag and keep all the sin himself. There is
no literary art about a government report. It stops a story right in the
most interesting place.</p>
<p>These reports of Thug expeditions run along interminably in one
monotonous tune: “Met a sepoy–killed him; met 5 pundits–killed them; met
4 Rajpoots and a woman–killed them“–and so on, till the statistics get
to be pretty dry. But this small trip of Feringhea’s Forty had some
little variety about it. Once they came across a man hiding in a grave
–a thief; he had stolen 1,100 rupees from Dhunroj Seith of Parowtee.
They strangled him and took the money. They had no patience with
thieves. They killed two treasure-bearers, and got 4,000 rupees. They
came across two bullocks “laden with copper pice,“ and killed the four
drivers and took the money. There must have been half a ton of it. I
think it takes a double handful of pice to make an anna, and 16 annas to
make a rupee; and even in those days the rupee was worth only half a
dollar. Coming back over their tracks from Baroda, they had another
picturesque stroke of luck: “‘The Lohars of Oodeypore’ put a traveler in
their charge for safety.“ Dear, dear, across this abyssmal gulf of time
we still see Feringhea’s lips uncover his teeth, and through the dim
haze we catch the incandescent glimmer of his smile. He accepted that
trust, good man; and so we know what went with the traveler.</p>
<p>Even Rajahs had no terrors for Feringhea; he came across an
elephant-driver belonging to the Rajah of Oodeypore and promptly
strangled him.</p>
<p>“A total of 100 men and 5 women murdered on this expedition.“</p>
<p>Among the reports of expeditions we find mention of victims of almost
every quality and estate.</p>
<p>Also a prince’s cook; and even the water-carrier of that sublime lord
of lords and king of kings, the Governor-General of India! How broad
they were in their tastes! They also murdered actors–poor wandering
barnstormers. There are two instances recorded; the first one by a gang
of Thugs under a chief who soils a great name borne by a better man
–Kipling’s deathless “Gungadin“:</p>
<p>“After murdering 4 sepoys, going on toward Indore, met 4 strolling
players, and persuaded them to come with us, on the pretense that we
would see their performance at the next stage. Murdered them at a temple
near Bhopal.“</p>
<p>Second instance:</p>
<p>“At Deohuttee, joined by comedians. Murdered them eastward of that
place.“</p>
<p>But this gang was a particularly bad crew. On that expedition they
murdered a fakeer and twelve beggars. And yet Bhowanee protected them;
for once when they were strangling a man in a wood when a crowd was
going by close at hand and the noose slipped and the man screamed,
Bhowanee made a camel burst out at the same moment with a roar that
drowned the scream; and before the man could repeat it the breath was
choked out of his body.</p>
<p>The cow is so sacred in India that to kill her keeper is an awful
sacrilege, and even the Thugs recognized this; yet now and then the lust
for blood was too strong, and so they did kill a few cow-keepers. In one
of these instances the witness who killed the cowherd said, “In Thuggee
this is strictly forbidden, and is an act from which no good can come. I
was ill of a fever for ten days afterward. I do believe that evil will
follow the murder of a man with a cow. If there be no cow it does not
signify.“ Another Thug said he held the cowherd’s feet while this
witness did the strangling. He felt no concern, “because the bad fortune
of such a deed is upon the strangler and not upon the assistants; even
if there should be a hundred of them.“</p>
<p>There were thousands of Thugs roving over India constantly, during
many generations. They made Thug gee a hereditary vocation and taught it
to their sons and to their son’s sons. Boys were in full membership as
early as 16 years of age; veterans were still at work at 70. What was
the fascination, what was the impulse? Apparently, it was partly piety,
largely gain, and there is reason to suspect that the sport afforded was
the chiefest fascination of all. Meadows Taylor makes a Thug in one of
his books claim that the pleasure of killing men was the white man’s
beast-hunting instinct enlarged, refined, ennobled. I will quote the
passage:</p>
