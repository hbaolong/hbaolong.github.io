<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>These speeches will address themselves to the minds and hearts of
those who read them, but not with the effect they had with those who
heard them; Clemens himself would have said, not with half the effect. I
have noted elsewhere how he always held that the actor doubled the value
of the author’s words; and he was a great actor as well as a great
author. He was a most consummate actor, with this difference from other
actors, that he was the first to know the thoughts and invent the
fancies to which his voice and action gave the color of life.
Representation is the art of other actors; his art was creative as well
as representative; it was nothing at second hand.</p>
<p>I never heard Clemens speak when I thought he quite failed; some
burst or spurt redeemed him when he seemed flagging short of the goal,
and, whoever else was in the running, he came in ahead. His
near-failures were the error of a rare trust to the spontaneity in which
other speakers confide, or are believed to confide, when they are on
their feet. He knew that from the beginning of oratory the orator’s
spontaneity was for the silence and solitude of the closet where he
mused his words to an imagined audience; that this was the use of
orators from Demosthenes and Cicero up and down. He studied every word
and syllable, and memorized them by a system of mnemonics peculiar to
himself, consisting of an arbitrary arrangement of things on a
table–knives, forks, salt-cellars; inkstands, pens, boxes, or whatever
was at hand–which stood for points and clauses and climaxes, and were at
once indelible diction and constant suggestion. He studied every tone
and every gesture, and he forecast the result with the real audience
from its result with that imagined audience. Therefore, it was beautiful
to see him and to hear him; he rejoiced in the pleasure he gave and the
blows of surprise which he dealt; and because he had his end in mind, he
knew when to stop.</p>
<p>I have been talking of his method and manner; the matter the reader
has here before him; and it is good matter, glad, honest, kind,
just.</p>
<p>W. D. HOWELLS.</p>
<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>FROM THE PREFACE TO THE ENGLISH EDITION OF “MARK TWAIN’S
SKETCHES“</p>
<p>If I were to sell the reader a barrel of molasses, and he, instead of
sweetening his substantial dinner with the same at judicious intervals,
should eat the entire barrel at one sitting, and then abuse me for
making him sick, I would say that he deserved to be made sick for not
knowing any better how to utilize the blessings this world affords. And
if I sell to the reader this volume of nonsense, and he, instead of
seasoning his graver reading with a chapter of it now and then, when his
mind demands such relaxation, unwisely overdoses himself with several
chapters of it at a single sitting, he will deserve to be nauseated, and
he will have nobody to blame but himself if he is. There is no more sin
in publishing an entire volume of nonsense than there is in keeping a
candy-store with no hardware in it. It lies wholly with the customer
whether he will injure himself by means of either, or will derive from
them the benefits which they will afford him if he uses their
possibilities judiciously. Respectfully submitted, THE AUTHOR.</p>
