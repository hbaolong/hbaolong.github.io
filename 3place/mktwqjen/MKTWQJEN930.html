id="letters-and-memoranda-to-mrs.-clemens-in-ouchy-switzerland">LETTERs
and Memoranda to Mrs. Clemens, in Ouchy, Switzerland:</h4>
<p>Sept. 20, 1891. Sunday, 11 a.m. On the lake Bourget–just started. The
castle of Chatillon high overhead showing above the trees. It was a
wonderfully still place to sleep in. Beside us there was nobody in it
but a woman, a boy and a dog. A Pope was born in the room I slept in.
No, he became a Pope later.</p>
<p>The lake is smooth as glass–a brilliant sun is shining.</p>
<p>Our boat is comfortable and shady with its awning.</p>
<p>11.20 We have crossed the lake and are entering the canal. Shall
presently be in the Rhone.</p>
<p>Noon. Nearly down to the Rhone. Passing the village of Chanaz.</p>
<p>3.15 p. m. Sunday. We have been in the Rhone 3 hours. It is
unimaginably still and reposeful and cool and soft and breezy. No rowing
or work of any kind to do–we merely float with the current–we glide
noiseless and swift–as fast as a London cab-horse rips along–8 miles an
hour–the swiftest current I’ve ever boated in. We have the entire river
to ourselves–nowhere a boat of any kind. Good bye Sweetheart S. L.
C.</p>
<p>PORT DE GROLEE, Monday, 4.15 p.m. [Sept. 21, 1891] Name of the
village which we left five minutes ago.</p>
<p>We went ashore at 5 p. m. yesterday, dear heart, and walked a short
mile to St. Geuix, a big village, and took quarters at the principal
inn; had a good dinner and afterwards along walk out of town on the
banks of the Guiers till 7.30.</p>
<p>Went to bed at 8.30 and continued to make notes and read books and
newspapers till midnight. Slept until 8, breakfasted in bed, and lay
till noon, because there had been a very heavy rain in the night and the
day was still dark and lowering. But at noon the sun broke through and
in 15 minutes we were tramping toward the river. Got afloat at 1 p. m.
but at 2.40 we had to rush suddenly ashore and take refuge in the above
village. Just as we got ourselves and traps safely housed in the inn,
the rain let go and came down in great style. We lost an hour and a half
there, but we are off again, now, with bright sunshine.</p>
<p>I wrote you yesterday my darling, and shall expect to write you every
day.</p>
<p>Good-day, and love to all of you. SAML.</p>
<p>ON THE RHONE BELOW VILLEBOIS, Tuesday noon. Good morning, sweetheart.
Night caught us yesterday where we had to take quarters in a peasant’s
house which was occupied by the family and a lot of cows and calves–also
several rabbits.–[His word for fleas.]–The latter had a ball, and I was
the ball-room; but they were very friendly and didn’t bite.</p>
<p>The peasants were mighty kind and hearty, and flew around and did
their best to make us comfortable. This morning I breakfasted on the
shore in the open air with two sociable dogs and a cat. Clean cloth,
napkin and table furniture, white sugar, a vast hunk of excellent
butter, good bread, first class coffee with pure milk, fried fish just
caught. Wonderful that so much cleanliness should come out of such a
phenomenally dirty house.</p>
<p>An hour ago we saw the Falls of the Rhone, a prodigiously rough and
dangerous looking place; shipped a little water but came to no harm. It
was one of the most beautiful pieces of piloting and boat-management I
ever saw. Our admiral knew his business.</p>
<p>We have had to run ashore for shelter every time it has rained
heretofore, but Joseph has been putting in his odd time making a
water-proof sun-bonnet for the boat, and now we sail along dry although
we had many heavy showers this morning.</p>
<p>With a word of love to you all and particularly you, SAML.</p>
<p>ON THE RHONE, BELOW VIENNA. I salute you, my darling. Your telegram
reached me in Lyons last night and was very pleasant news indeed.</p>
<p>I was up and shaved before 8 this morning, but we got delayed and
didn’t sail from Lyons till 10.30–an hour and a half lost. And we’ve
lost another hour–two of them, I guess–since, by an error. We came in
sight of Vienne at 2 o’clock, several miles ahead, on a hill, and I
proposed to walk down there and let the boat go ahead of us. So Joseph
and I got out and struck through a willow swamp along a dim path, and by
and by came out on the steep bank of a slough or inlet or something, and
we followed that bank forever and ever trying to get around the head of
that slough. Finally I noticed a twig standing up in the water, and by
George it had a distinct and even vigorous quiver to it! I don’t know
when I have felt so much like a donkey. On an island! I wanted to drown
somebody, but I hadn’t anybody I could spare. However, after another
long tramp we found a lonely native, and he had a scow and soon we were
on the mainland–yes, and a blamed sight further from Vienne than we were
when we started.</p>
<p>Notes–I make millions of them; and so I get no time to write to you.
If you’ve got a pad there, please send it poste-restante to Avignon. I
may not need it but I fear I shall.</p>
<p>I’m straining to reach St. Pierre de Boef, but it’s going to be a
close fit, I reckon.</p>
<p>AFLOAT, Friday, 3 p.m., ’91. Livy darling, we sailed from St. Pierre
de Boef six hours ago, and are now approaching Tournon, where we shall
not stop, but go on and make Valence, a City Of 25,000 people. It’s too
delicious, floating with the swift current under the awning these superb
sunshiny days in deep peace and quietness. Some of these curious old
historical towns strangely persuade me, but it is so lovely afloat that
I don’t stop, but view them from the outside and sail on. We get
abundance of grapes and peaches for next to nothing.</p>
<p>Joseph is perfect. He is at his very best–and never was better in his
life. I guess he gets discouraged and feels disliked and in the way when
he is lying around–but here he is perfection, and brim full of useful
alacrities and helps and ingenuities.</p>
<p>When I woke up an hour ago and heard the clock strike 4, I said “I
seem to have been asleep an immensely long time; I must have gone to bed
mighty early; I wonder what time I did go to bed.“ And I got up and lit
a candle and looked at my watch to see.</p>
<p>AFLOAT 2 HOURS BELOW BOURG ST. ANDEOL. Monday, 11 a.m., Sept. 28.
Livy darling, I didn’t write yesterday. We left La Voulte in a driving
storm of cold rain–couldn’t write in it–and at 1 p. m. when we were not
thinking of stopping, we saw a picturesque and mighty ruin on a high
hill back of a village, and I was seized with a desire to explore it; so
we landed at once and set out with rubbers and umbrella, sending the
boat ahead to St. Andeol, and we spent 3 hours clambering about those
cloudy heights among those worn and vast and idiotic ruins of a castle
built by two crusaders 650 years ago. The work of these asses was full
of interest, and we had a good time inspecting, examining and
scrutinizing it. All the hills on both sides of the Rhone have peaks and
precipices, and each has its gray and wasted pile of mouldy walls and
broken towers. The Romans displaced the Gauls, the Visigoths displaced
the Romans, the Saracens displaced the Visigoths, the Christians
displaced the Saracens, and it was these pious animals who built these
strange lairs and cut each other’s throats in the name and for the glory
of God, and robbed and burned and slew in peace and war; and the pauper
and the slave built churches, and the credit of it went to the Bishop
who racked the money out of them. These are pathetic shores, and they
make one despise the human race.</p>
<p>We came down in an hour by rail, but I couldn’t get your telegram
till this morning, for it was Sunday and they had shut up the post
office to go to the circus. I went, too. It was all one family–parents
and 5 children–performing in the open air to 200 of these enchanted
villagers, who contributed coppers when called on. It was a most gay and
strange and pathetic show. I got up at 7 this morning to see the poor
devils cook their poor breakfast and pack up their sordid fineries.</p>
<p>This is a 9 k-m. current and the wind is with us; we shall make
Avignon before 4 o’clock. I saw watermelons and pomegranates for sale at
St. Andeol.</p>
<p>With a power of love, Sweetheart, SAML.</p>
<p>HOTEL D’EUROPE, AVIGNON, Monday, 6 p.m., Sept. 28. Well, Livy
darling, I have been having a perfect feast of letters for an hour, and
I thank you and dear Clam with all my heart. It’s like hearing from home
after a long absence.</p>
<p>It is early to be in bed, but I’m always abed before 9, on this
voyage; and up at 7 or a trifle later, every morning. If I ever take
such a trip again, I will have myself called at the first tinge of dawn
and get to sea as soon after as possible. The early dawn on the
water-nothing can be finer, as I know by old Mississippi experience. I
did so long for you and Sue yesterday morning–the most superb
sunrise!–the most marvelous sunrise! and I saw it all from the very
faintest suspicion of the coming dawn all the way through to the final
explosion of glory. But it had interest private to itself and not to be
found elsewhere in the world; for between me and it, in the far
distant-eastward, was a silhouette mountain-range in which I had
discovered, the previous afternoon, a most noble face upturned to the
sky, and mighty form out stretched, which I had named Napoleon Dreaming
of Universal Empire–and now, this prodigious face, soft, rich, blue,
spirituelle, asleep, tranquil, reposeful, lay against that giant
conflagration of ruddy and golden splendors all rayed like a wheel with
the upstreaming and far-reaching lances of the sun. It made one want to
cry for delight, it was so supreme in its unimaginable majesty and
beauty.</p>
<p>We had a curious experience today. A little after I had sealed and
directed my letter to you, in which I said we should make Avignon before
4, we got lost. We ceased to encounter any village or ruin mentioned in
our “particularizes“ and detailed Guide of the Rhone–went drifting along
by the hour in a wholly unknown land and on an uncharted river! Confound
it, we stopped talking and did nothing but stand up in the boat and
search the horizons with the glass and wonder what in the devil had
happened. And at last, away yonder at 5 o’clock when some east towers
and fortresses hove in sight we couldn’t recognize them for Avignon–yet
we knew by the broken bridge that it was Avignon.</p>
<p>Then we saw what the trouble was–at some time or other we had drifted
down the wrong side of an island and followed a sluggish branch of the
Rhone not frequented in modern times. We lost an hour and a half by it
and missed one of the most picturesque and gigantic and history-sodden
masses of castellated medieval ruin that Europe can show.</p>
<p>It was dark by the time we had wandered through the town and got the
letters and found the hotel–so I went to bed.</p>
<p>We shall leave here at noon tomorrow and float down to Arles,
arriving about dark, and there bid good bye to the boat, the river-trip
finished. Between Arles and Nimes (and Avignon again,) we shall be till
Saturday morning–then rail it through on that day to Ouchy, reaching the
hotel at 11 at night if the train isn’t late.</p>
<p>Next day (Sunday) if you like, go to Basel, and Monday to Berlin. But
I shall be at your disposal, to do exactly as you desire and prefer.</p>
<p>With no end of love to all of you and twice as much to you,
sweetheart, SAML.</p>
<p>I believe my arm is a trifle better than it was when I started.</p>
<p>The mention in the foregoing letter of the Napoleon effigy is the
beginning of what proved to be a rather interesting episode. Mark Twain
thought a great deal of his discovery, as he called it–the giant figure
of Napoleon outlined by the distant mountain range. In his note-book he
entered memoranda telling just where it was to be seen, and added a
pencil sketch of the huge profile. But then he characteristically forgot
all about it, and when he recalled the incident ten years later, he
could not remember the name of the village, Beauchastel, from which the
great figure could be seen; also, that he had made a record of the
place.</p>
<p>But he was by this time more certain than ever that his discovery was
a remarkable one, which, if known, would become one of the great natural
wonders, such as Niagara Falls. Theodore Stanton was visiting him at the
time, and Clemens urged him, on his return to France, to make an
excursion to the Rhone and locate the Lost Napoleon, as he now called
it. But Clemens remembered the wonder as being somewhere between Arles
and Avignon, instead of about a hundred miles above the last-named town.
Stanton naturally failed to find it, and it remained for the writer of
these notes, motoring up the Rhone one September day, exactly twenty-two
years after the first discovery, to re-locate the vast reclining figure
of the first consul of France, “dreaming of Universal Empire.“ The
re-discovery was not difficult–with Mark Twain’s memoranda as a
guide–and it was worth while. Perhaps the Lost Napoleon is not so
important a natural wonder as Mark Twain believed, but it is a striking
picture, and on a clear day the calm blue face outlined against the sky
will long hold the traveler’s attention.</p>
<p>To Clara Clemens, in Ouchy, Switzerland:</p>
<p>AFLOAT, 11.20 a.m., Sept. 29, Tuesday. DEAR OLD BEN,–The vast stone
masses and huge towers of the ancient papal palace of Avignon are
projected above an intervening wooded island a mile up the river behind
me–for we are already on our way to Arles. It is a perfectly still
morning, with a brilliant sun, and very hot–outside; but I am under
cover of the linen hood, and it is cool and shady in here.</p>
<p>Please tell mamma I got her very last letter this morning, and I
perceive by it that I do not need to arrive at Ouchy before Saturday
midnight. I am glad, because I couldn’t do the railroading I am
proposing to do during the next two or three days and get there earlier.
I could put in the time till Sunday midnight, but shall not venture it
without telegraphic instructions from her to Nimes day after tomorrow,
Oct. 1, care Hotel Manivet.</p>
<p>The only adventures we have is in drifting into rough seas now and
then. They are not dangerous, but they go thro’ all the motions of it.
Yesterday when we shot the Bridge of the Holy Spirit it was probably in
charge of some inexperienced deputy spirit for the day, for we were
allowed to go through the wrong arch, which brought us into a tourbillon
below which tried to make this old scow stand on its head. Of course I
lost my temper and blew it off in a way to be heard above the roar of
the tossing waters. I lost it because the admiral had taken that arch in
deference to my opinion that it was the best one, while his own judgment
told him to take the one nearest the other side of the river. I could
have poisoned him I was so mad to think I had hired such a turnip. A
boatman in command should obey nobody’s orders but his own, and yield to
nobody’s suggestions.</p>
<p>It was very sweet of you to write me, dear, and I thank you ever so
much. With greatest love and kisses, PAPA.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Ouchy, Switzerland:</p>
<p>ARLES, Sept. 30, noon. Livy darling, I hain’t got no time to write
today, because I am sight seeing industriously and imagining my
chapter.</p>
<p>Bade good-bye to the river trip and gave away the boat yesterday
evening. We had ten great days in her.</p>
<p>We reached here after dark. We were due about 4.30, counting by
distance, but we couldn’t calculate on such a lifeless current as we
found. I love you, sweetheart. SAML.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since Clemens had written to his old friend
Twichell, but the Rhone trip must have reminded him of those days
thirteen years earlier, when, comparatively young men, he and Twichell
were tramping through the Black Forest and scaling Gemmi Pass. He sent
Twichell a reminder of that happy time.</p>
<p>To Rev. Joseph H. Twichell, in Hartford, Conn:</p>
<p>NIMES, Oct. 1, ’91. DEAR JOE,–I have been ten days floating down the
Rhone on a raft, from Lake Bourget, and a most curious and darling kind
of a trip it has been. You ought to have been along–I could have made
room for you easily–and you would have found that a pedestrian tour in
Europe doesn’t begin with a raft-voyage for hilarity and mild adventure,
and intimate contact with the unvisited native of the back settlements,
and extinction from the world and newspapers, and a conscience in a
state of coma, and lazy comfort, and solid happiness. In fact there’s
nothing that’s so lovely.</p>
<p>But it’s all over. I gave the raft away yesterday at Arles, and am
loafing along back by short stages on the rail to Ouchy-Lausanne where
the tribe are staying. Love to you all MARK.</p>
<p>The Clemenses settled in Berlin for the winter, at 7 Kornerstrasse,
and later at the Hotel Royal. There had been no permanent improvement in
Mark Twain’s arm and he found writing difficult. Some of the letters
promised to Laffan and McClure were still unfinished.</p>
<p>Young Hall, his publishing manager in America, was working hard to
keep the business afloat, and being full of the optimism of his years
did not fail to make as good a showing as he could. We may believe his
letters were very welcome to Clemens and his wife, who found little
enough in the general prospect to comfort them.</p>
<p>To Mr. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>BERLIN, Nov. 27, ’91. DEAR MR. HALL,–That kind of a statement is
valuable. It came this morning. This is the first time since the
business began that I have had a report that furnished the kind of
information I wanted, and was really enlightening and satisfactory. Keep
it up. Don’t let it fall into desuetude.</p>
<p>Everything looks so fine and handsome with the business, now, that I
feel a great let-up from depression. The rewards of your long and
patient industry are on their way, and their arrival safe in port,
presently, seems assured.</p>
<p>By George, I shall be glad when the ship comes in!</p>
<p>My arm is so much better that I was able to make a speech last night
to 250 Americans. But when they threw my portrait on the screen it was a
sorrowful reminder, for it was from a negative of 15 years ago, and
hadn’t a gray hair in it. And now that my arm is better, I have stolen a
couple of days and finished up a couple of McClure letters that have
been lying a long time.</p>
<p>I shall mail one of them to you next Tuesday–registered. Lookout for
it.</p>
<p>I shall register and mail the other one (concerning the “Jungfrau“)
next Friday look out for it also, and drop me a line to let me know they
have arrived.</p>
<p>I shall write the 6th and last letter by and by when I have studied
Berlin sufficiently.</p>
<p>Yours in a most cheerful frame of mind, and with my and all the
family’s Thanksgiving greetings and best wishes, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Postscript by Mrs. Clemens written on Mr. Clemens’s letter:</p>
<p>DEAR MR. HALL,–This is my birthday and your letter this morning was a
happy addition to the little gifts on the breakfast table. I thought of
going out and spending money for something unnecessary after it came,
but concluded perhaps I better wait a little longer. Sincerely yours O.
L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>“The German Chicago“ was the last of the six McClure letters and was
finished that winter in Berlin. It is now included in the Uniform
Edition of Mark Twain’s works, and is one of the best descriptive
articles of the German capital ever written. He made no use of the Rhone
notes further than to put them together in literary form. They did not
seem to him to contain enough substance to warrant publication. A letter
to Hall, written toward the end of December, we find rather gloomy in
tone, though he is still able to extract comfort and even cheerfulness
from one of Mr. Hall’s reports.</p>
<p>Memorandum to Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>Among the MSS I left with you are a few that have a recent look and
are written on rather stiff pale green paper. If you will have those
type-writered and keep the originals and send me the copies (one per
mail, not two.) I’ll see if I can use them.</p>
<p>But tell Howells and other inquirers that my hopes of writing
anything are very slender–I seem to be disabled for life.</p>
<p>Drop McClure a line and tell him the same. I can’t dare to make an
engagement now for even a single letter.</p>
<p>I am glad Howells is on a magazine, but sorry he gave up the Study. I
shall have to go on a magazine myself if this L. A. L. continues to hold
my nose down to the grind-stone much longer.</p>
<p>I’m going to hold my breath, now, for 30 days–then the annual
statement will arrive and I shall know how we feel! Merry Xmas to you
from us all.</p>
<p>Sincerely, S. L. C.</p>
<p>P. S. Just finished the above and finished raging at the eternal
German tax-gatherer, and so all the jubilant things which I was going to
say about the past year’s business got knocked out of me. After writing
this present letter I was feeling blue about Huck Finn, but I sat down
and overhauled your reports from now back to last April and compared
them with the splendid Oct.-Nov. business, and went to bed feeling
refreshed and fine, for certainly it has been a handsome year. Now rush
me along the Annual Report and let’s see how we feel! S. L. C.</p>
<p>XXXII</p>
