<h4 id="water-supply">WATER-SUPPLY</h4>
<p>Mr. Clemens visited Albany on February 21 and 28, 1901. The
privileges of the floor were granted and he was asked to make a short
address to the Senate.</p>
<p>MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,–I do not know how to thank you
sufficiently for this high honor which you are conferring upon me. I
have for the second time now enjoyed this kind of prodigal
hospitality–in the other House yesterday, to-day in this one. I am a
modest man, and diffident about appearing before legislative bodies, and
yet utterly an entirely appreciative of a courtesy like this when it is
extended to me, and I thank you very much for it.</p>
<p>If I had the privilege, which unfortunately I have not got, of
suggesting things to the legislators in my individual capacity, I would
so enjoy the opportunity that I would not charge anything for it at all.
I would do that without a salary. I would give them the benefit of my
wisdom and experience in legislative bodies, and if I could have had the
privilege for a few minutes of giving advice to the other House I should
have liked to, but of course I could not undertake it, as they did not
ask me to do it–but if they had only asked me!</p>
<p>Now that the House is considering a measure which is to furnish a
water-supply to the city of New York, why, permit me to say I live in
New York myself. I know all about its ways, its desires, and its
residents, and–if I had the privilege–I should have urged them not to
weary themselves over a measure like that to furnish water to the city
of New York, for we never drink it.</p>
<p>But I will not venture to advise this body, as I only venture to
advise bodies who are, not present.</p>
<p>MISTAKEN IDENTITY</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE ANNUAL “LADIES’ DAY,“ PAPYRUS CLUB, BOSTON</p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,–I am perfectly astonished–a-s-t-o-n-i-s-h-e-d
–ladies and gentlemen–astonished at the way history repeats itself. I
find myself situated at this moment exactly and precisely as I was once
before, years ago, to a jot, to a tittle–to a very hair. There isn’t a
shade of difference. It is the most astonishing coincidence that ever
–but wait. I will tell you the former instance, and then you will see it
for yourself. Years ago I arrived one day at Salamanca, New York,
eastward bound; must change cars there and take the sleeper train. There
were crowds of people there, and they were swarming into the long
sleeper train and packing it full, and it was a perfect purgatory of
dust and confusion and gritting of teeth and soft, sweet, and low
profanity. I asked the young man in the ticket-office if I could have a
sleeping-section, and he answered “No,“ with a snarl that shrivelled me
up like burned leather. I went off, smarting under this insult to my
dignity, and asked another local official, supplicatingly, if I couldn’t
have some poor little corner somewhere in a sleeping-car; but he cut me
short with a venomous “No, you can’t; every corner is full. Now, don’t
bother me any more“; and he turned his back and walked off. My dignity
was in a state now which cannot be described. I was so ruffled that
–“well,“ I said to my companion, “If these people knew who I am they–“
But my companion cut me short there–“Don’t talk such folly,“ he said;
“if they did know who you are, do you suppose it would help your
high-mightiness to a vacancy in a train which has no vacancies in
it?“</p>
<p>This did not improve my condition any to speak of, but just then I
observed that the colored porter of a sleeping-car had his eye on me. I
saw his dark countenance light up. He whispered to the uniformed
conductor, punctuating with nods and jerks toward me, and straightway
this conductor came forward, oozing politeness from every pore.</p>
<p>“Can I be of any service to you?“ he asked. “Will you have a place in
the sleeper?“</p>
<p>“Yes,“ I said, “and much oblige me, too. Give me anything–anything
will answer.“</p>
<p>“We have nothing left but the big family state-room,“ he continued,
“with two berths and a couple of arm-chairs in it, but it is entirely at
your disposal. Here, Tom, take these satchels aboard!“</p>
<p>Then he touched his hat and we and the colored Tom moved along. I was
bursting to drop just one little remark to my companion, but I held in
and waited. Tom made us comfortable in that sumptuous great apartment,
and then said, with many bows and a perfect affluence of smiles:</p>
<p>“Now, is dey anything you want, sah? Case you kin have jes’ anything
you wants. It don’t make no difference what it is.“</p>
<p>“Can I have some hot water and a tumbler at nine to-night-blazing
hot?“ I asked. “You know about the right temperature for a hot Scotch
punch?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sah, dat you kin; you kin pen on it; I’ll get it myself.“</p>
<p>“Good! Now, that lamp is hung too high. Can I have a big coach candle
fixed up just at the head of my bed, so that I can read
comfortably?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sah, you kin; I’ll fix her up myself, an’ I’ll fix her so
she’ll burn all night. Yes, sah; an’ you can jes’ call for anything you
want, and dish yer whole railroad’ll be turned wrong end up an’ inside
out for to get it for you. Dat’s so.“ And he disappeared.</p>
<p>Well, I tilted my head back, hooked my thumbs in my armholes, smiled
a smile on my companion, and said, gently:</p>
<p>“Well, what do you say now?“</p>
<p>My companion was not in the humor to respond, and didn’t. The next
moment that smiling black face was thrust in at the crack of the door,
and this speech followed:</p>
<p>“Laws bless you, sah, I knowed you in a minute. I told de conductah
so. Laws! I knowed you de minute I sot eyes on you.“</p>
<p>“Is that so, my boy?“ (Handing him a quadruple fee.) “Who am I?“</p>
<p>“Jenuel McClellan,“ and he disappeared again.</p>
<p>My companion said, vinegarishly, “Well, well! what do you say now?“
Right there comes in the marvellous coincidence I mentioned a while ago
–viz., I was speechless, and that is my condition now. Perceive it?</p>
<p>CATS AND CANDY</p>
<p>The following address was delivered at a social meeting of literary
men in New York in 1874:</p>
<p>When I was fourteen I was living with my parents, who were very
poor–and correspondently honest. We had a youth living with us by the
name of Jim Wolfe. He was an excellent fellow, seventeen years old, and
very diffident. He and I slept together–virtuously; and one bitter
winter’s night a cousin Mary–she’s married now and gone–gave what they
call a candy-pulling in those days in the West, and they took the
saucers of hot candy outside of the house into the snow, under a sort of
old bower that came from the eaves–it was a sort of an ell then, all
covered with vines–to cool this hot candy in the snow, and they were all
sitting there. In the mean time we were gone to bed. We were not invited
to attend this party; we were too young.</p>
<p>The young ladies and gentlemen were assembled there, and Jim and I
were in bed. There was about four inches of snow on the roof of this
ell, and our windows looked out on it; and it was frozen hard. A couple
of tom-cats–it is possible one might have been of the opposite sex–were
assembled on the chimney in the middle of this ell, and they were
growling at a fearful rate, and switching their tails about and going
on, and we couldn’t sleep at all.</p>
<p>Finally Jim said, “For two cents I’d go out and snake them cats off
that chimney.“ So I said, “Of course you would.“ He said, “Well, I
would; I have a mighty good notion to do it.“ Says I, “Of course you
have; certainly you have, you have a great notion to do it.“ I hoped he
might try it, but I was afraid he wouldn’t.</p>
<p>Finally I did get his ambition up, and he raised the window and
climbed out on the icy roof, with nothing on but his socks and a very
short shirt. He went climbing along on all fours on the roof toward the
chimney where the cats were. In the mean time these young ladies and
gentlemen were enjoying themselves down under the eaves, and when Jim
got almost to that chimney he made a pass at the cats, and his heels
flew up and he shot down and crashed through those vines, and lit in the
midst of the ladies and gentlemen, and sat down in those hot saucers of
candy.</p>
<p>There was a stampede, of course, and he came up-stairs dropping
pieces of chinaware and candy all the way up, and when he got up
there–now anybody in the world would have gone into profanity or
something calculated to relieve the mind, but he didn’t; he scraped the
candy off his legs, nursed his blisters a little, and said, “I could
have ketched them cats if I had had on a good ready.“</p>
<p>[Does any reader know what a “ready“ was in 1840? D.W.]</p>
<p>OBITUARY POETRY</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE ACTORS’ FUND FAIR, PHILADELPHIA, in 1895</p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,–The–er this–er–welcome occasion gives me an
–er–opportunity to make an–er–explanation that I have long desired to
deliver myself of. I rise to the highest honors before a Philadelphia
audience. In the course of my checkered career I have, on divers
occasions, been charged–er–maliciously with a more or less serious
offence. It is in reply to one of the more–er–important of these that I
wish to speak. More than once I have been accused of writing obituary
poetry in the Philadelphia Ledger.</p>
<p>I wish right here to deny that dreadful assertion. I will admit that
once, when a compositor in the Ledger establishment, I did set up some
of that poetry, but for a worse offence than that no indictment can be
found against me. I did not write that poetry–at least, not all of
it.</p>
<p>CIGARS AND TOBACCO</p>
<p>My friends for some years now have remarked that I am an inveterate
consumer of tobacco. That is true, but my habits with regard to tobacco
have changed. I have no doubt that you will say, when I have explained
to you what my present purpose is, that my taste has deteriorated, but I
do not so regard it.</p>
<p>Whenever I held a smoking-party at my house, I found that my guests
had always just taken the pledge.</p>
<p>Let me tell you briefly the history of my personal relation to
tobacco. It began, I think, when I was a lad, and took the form of a
quid, which I became expert in tucking under my tongue. Afterward I
learned the delights of the pipe, and I suppose there was no other
youngster of my age who could more deftly cut plug tobacco so as to make
it available for pipe-smoking.</p>
<p>Well, time ran on, and there came a time when I was able to gratify
one of my youthful ambitions–I could buy the choicest Havana cigars
without seriously interfering with my income. I smoked a good many,
changing off from the Havana cigars to the pipe in the course of a day’s
smoking.</p>
<p>At last it occurred to me that something was lacking in the Havana
cigar. It did not quite fulfil my youthful anticipations. I
experimented. I bought what was called a seed-leaf cigar with a
Connecticut wrapper. After a while I became satiated of these, and I
searched for something else, The Pittsburg stogy was recommended to me.
It certainly had the merit of cheapness, if that be a merit in tobacco,
and I experimented with the stogy.</p>
<p>Then, once more, I changed off, so that I might acquire the subtler
flavor of the Wheeling toby. Now that palled, and I looked around New
York in the hope of finding cigars which would seem to most people vile,
but which, I am sure, would be ambrosial to me. I couldn’t find any.
They put into my hands some of those little things that cost ten cents a
box, but they are a delusion.</p>
<p>I said to a friend, “I want to know if you can direct me to an honest
tobacco merchant who will tell me what is the worst cigar in the New
York market, excepting those made for Chinese consumption–I want real
tobacco. If you will do this and I find the man is as good as his word,
I will guarantee him a regular market for a fair amount of his
cigars.“</p>
<p>We found a tobacco dealer who would tell the truth–who, if a cigar
was bad, would boldly say so. He produced what he called the very worst
cigars he had ever had in his shop. He let me experiment with one then
and there. The test was satisfactory.</p>
<p>This was, after all, the real thing. I negotiated for a box of them
and took them away with me, so that I might be sure of having them handy
when I want them.</p>
<p>I discovered that the “worst cigars,“ so called, are the best for me,
after all.</p>
<p>BILLIARDS</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens attended a billiard tourney on the evening of April 24,
1906, and was called on to tell a story.</p>
<p>The game of billiards has destroyed my naturally sweet disposition.
Once, when I was an underpaid reporter in Virginia City, whenever I
wished to play billiards I went out to look for an easy mark. One day a
stranger came to town and opened a billiard parlor. I looked him over
casually. When he proposed a game, I answered, “All right.“</p>
<p>“Just knock the balls around a little so that I can get your gait,“
he said; and when I had done so, he remarked: “I will be perfectly fair
with you. I’ll play you left-handed.“ I felt hurt, for he was
cross-eyed, freckled, and had red hair, and I determined to teach him a
lesson. He won first shot, ran out, took my half-dollar, and all I got
was the opportunity to chalk my cue.</p>
<p>“If you can play like that with your left hand,“ I said, “I’d like to
see you play with your right.“</p>
<p>“I can’t,“ he said. “I’m left-handed.“</p>
<p>THE UNION RIGHT OR WRONG</p>
<p>REMINISCENCES OF NEVADA</p>
<p>I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that Nevada had lively
newspapers in those days.</p>
<p>My great competitor among the reporters was Boggs, of the Union, an
excellent reporter.</p>
<p>Once in three or four months he would get a little intoxicated; but,
as a general thing, he was a wary and cautious drinker, although always
ready to damp himself a little with the enemy.</p>
<p>He had the advantage of me in one thing: he could get the monthly
public-school report and I could not, because the principal hated my
sheet –the ‘Enterprise’.</p>
<p>One snowy night, when the report was due, I started out, sadly
wondering how I was to get it.</p>
<p>Presently, a few steps up the almost deserted street, I stumbled on
Boggs, and asked him where he was going.</p>
<p>“After the school report.“</p>
<p>“I’ll go along with you.“</p>
<p>“No, Sir. I’ll excuse you.“</p>
<p>“Have it your own way.“</p>
<p>A saloon-keeper’s boy passed by with a steaming pitcher of hot punch,
and Boggs snuffed the fragrance gratefully.</p>
<p>He gazed fondly after the boy, and saw him start up the Enterprise
stairs.</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>“I wish you could help me get that school business, but since you
can’t, I must run up to the Union office and see if I can get a proof of
it after it’s set up, though I don’t begin to suppose I can. Good
night.“</p>
<p>“Hold on a minute. I don’t mind getting the report and sitting around
with the boys a little while you copy it, if you’re willing to drop down
to the principal’s with me.“</p>
<p>“Now you talk like a human being. Come along.“</p>
<p>We ploughed a couple of blocks through the snow, got the report–a
short document–and soon copied it in our office.</p>
<p>Meantime, Boggs helped himself to the punch.</p>
<p>I gave the manuscript back to him, and we started back to get an
inquest.</p>
<p>At four o’clock in the morning, when we had gone to press and were
having a relaxing concert as usual (for some of the printers were good
singers and others good performers on the guitar and on that atrocity
the accordion), the proprietor of the Union strode in and asked if
anybody had heard anything of Boggs or the school report.</p>
<p>We stated the case, and all turned out to help hunt for the
delinquent.</p>
<p>We found him standing on a table in a saloon, with an old tin lantern
in one hand and the school report in the other, haranguing a gang of
“corned“ miners on, the iniquity of squandering the public money on
education “when hundreds and hundreds of honest, hard-working men were
literally starving for whiskey.“</p>
<p>He had been assisting in a regal spree with those parties for
hours.</p>
<p>We dragged him away, and put him into bed.</p>
<p>Of course there was no school report in the Union, and Boggs held me
accountable, though I was innocent of any intention or desire to compass
its absence from that paper, and was as sorry as any one that the
misfortune had occurred. But we were perfectly friendly.</p>
<p>The day the next school report was due the proprietor of the
Tennessee Mine furnished us a buggy, and asked us to go down and write
something about the property–a very common request, and one always
gladly acceded to when people furnished buggies, for we were as fond of
pleasure excursions as other people.</p>
<p>The “mine“ was a hole in the ground ninety feet deep, and no way of
getting down into it but by holding on to a rope and being lowered with
a windlass.</p>
<p>The workmen had just gone off somewhere to dinner.</p>
<p>I was not strong enough to lower Boggs’s bulk, so I took an unlighted
candle in my teeth, made a loop for my foot in the end of the rope,
implored Boggs not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the start of
him, and then swung out over the shaft.</p>
<p>I reached the bottom muddy and bruised about the elbows, but
safe.</p>
<p>I lit the candle, made an examination of the rock, selected some
specimens, and shouted to Boggs to hoist away.</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>Presently a head appeared in the circle of daylight away aloft, and a
voice came down:</p>
<p>“Are you all set?“</p>
<p>“All set-hoist away!“</p>
<p>“Are you comfortable?“</p>
<p>“Perfectly.“</p>
<p>“Could you wait a little?“</p>
<p>“Oh, certainly-no particular hurry.“</p>
<p>“Well-good-bye.“</p>
<p>“Why, where are you going?“</p>
<p>“After the school report!“</p>
<p>And he did.</p>
<p>I stayed down there an hour, and surprised the workmen when they
hauled up and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock.</p>
<p>I walked home, too–five miles-up-hill.</p>
<p>We had no school report next morning–but the Union had.</p>
<p>AN IDEAL FRENCH ADDRESS</p>
<p>EXTRACT FROM “PARIS NOTES,“ IN “TOM SAWYER ABROAD,“ ETC.</p>
<p>I am told that a French sermon is like a French speech–it never names
an historical event, but only the date of it; if you are not up in
dates, you get left. A French speech is something like this:</p>
<p>“Comrades, citizens, brothers, noble parts of the only sublime and
perfect nation, let us not forget that the 21st January cast off our
chains; that the 10th August relieved us of the shameful presence of
foreign spies; that the 5th September was its own justification before
Heaven and humanity; that the 18th Brumaire contained the seeds of its
own punishment; that the 14th July was the mighty voice of liberty
proclaiming the resurrection, the new day, and inviting the oppressed
peoples of the earth to look upon the divine face of France and live;
and let us here record our everlasting curse against the man of the 2d
December, and declare in thunder tones, the native tones of France, that
but for him there had been no 17th Mardi in history, no 12th October,
nor 9th January, no 22d April, no 16th November, no 30th September, no
2d July, no 14th February, no 29th June, no 15th August, no 31st
May–that but for him, France, the pure, the grand, the peerless, had had
a serene and vacant almanac to-day.“</p>
<p>I have heard of one French sermon which closed in this odd yet
eloquent way:</p>
<p>“My hearers, we have sad cause to remember the man of the 13th
January. The results of the vast crime of the 13th January have been in
just proportion to the magnitude of the act itself. But for it there had
been no 30th November–sorrowful spectacle! The grisly deed of the 16th
June had not been done but for it, nor had the man of the 16th June
known existence; to it alone the 3d September was due, also the fatal
12th October. Shall we, then, be grateful for the 13th January, with its
freight of death for you and me and all that breathe? Yes, my friends,
for it gave us also that which had never come but for it, and it alone
–the blessed 25th December.“</p>
<p>It may be well enough to explain. The man of the 13th January is
Adam; the crime of that date was the eating of the apple; the sorrowful
spectacle of the 30th November was the expulsion from Eden; the grisly
deed of the 16th June was the murder of Abel; the act of the 3d
September was the beginning of the journey to the land of Nod; the 12th
day of October, the last mountaintops disappeared under the flood. When
you go to church in France, you want to take your almanac with
you–annotated.</p>
<p>STATISTICS</p>
<p>EXTRACT FROM “THE HISTORY OF THE SAVAGE CLUB“</p>
<p>During that period of gloom when domestic bereavement had forced
Mr. Clemens and his dear ones to secure the privacy they craved until
their wounds should heal, his address was known to only a very few of
his closest friends. One old friend in New York, after vain efforts to
get his address, wrote him a letter addressed as follows</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN, God Knows Where, Try London.</p>
<p>The letter found him, and Mr. Clemens replied to the letter
expressing himself surprised and complimented that the person who was
credited with knowing his whereabouts should take so much interest in
him, adding: “Had the letter been addressed to the care of the ‘other
party,’ I would naturally have expected to receive it without
delay.“</p>
<p>His correspondent tried again, and addressed the second letter:</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN, The Devil Knows Where, Try London.</p>
<p>This found him also no less promptly.</p>
<p>On June 9, 1899, he consented to visit the Savage Club, London, on
condition that there was to be no publicity and no speech was to be
expected from him. The toastmaster, in proposing the health of their
guest, said that as a Scotchman, and therefore as a born expert, he
thought Mark Twain had little or no claim to the title of humorist.
Mr. Clemens had tried to be funny but had failed, and his true role in
life was statistics; that he was a master of statistics, and loved them
for their own sake, and it would be the easiest task he ever undertook
if he would try to count all the real jokes he had ever made. While the
toastmaster was speaking, the members saw Mr. Clemens’s eyes begin to
sparkle and his cheeks to flush. He jumped up, and made a characteristic
speech.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am not a humorist, but I am a first-class fool–a simpleton;
for up to this moment I have believed Chairman MacAlister to be a decent
person whom I could allow to mix up with my friends and relatives. The
exhibition he has just made of himself reveals him to be a scoundrel and
a knave of the deepest dye. I have been cruelly deceived, and it serves
me right for trusting a Scotchman. Yes, I do understand figures, and I
can count. I have counted the words in MacAlister’s drivel (I certainly
cannot call it a speech), and there were exactly three thousand four
hundred and thirty-nine. I also carefully counted the lies–there were
exactly three thousand four hundred and thirty-nine. Therefore, I leave
MacAlister to his fate.</p>
<p>I was sorry to have my name mentioned as one of the great authors,
because they have a sad habit of dying off. Chaucer is dead, Spencer is
dead, so is Milton, so is Shakespeare, and I am not feeling very well
myself.</p>
<p>GALVESTON ORPHAN BAZAAR</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT A FAIR HELD AT THE WALDORF-ASTORIA, NEW YORK, IN OCTOBER,
1900, IN AID OF THE ORPHANS AT GALVESTON</p>
<p>I expected that the Governor of Texas would occupy this place first
and would speak to you, and in the course of his remarks would drop a
text for me to talk from; but with the proverbial obstinacy that is
proverbial with governors, they go back on their duties, and he has not
come here, and has not furnished me with a text, and I am here without a
text. I have no text except what you furnish me with your handsome
faces, and –but I won’t continue that, for I could go on forever about
attractive faces, beautiful dresses, and other things. But, after all,
compliments should be in order in a place like this.</p>
<p>I have been in New York two or three days, and have been in a
condition of strict diligence night and day, the object of this
diligence being to regulate the moral and political situation on this
planet–put it on a sound basis–and when you are regulating the
conditions of a planet it requires a great deal of talk in a great many
kinds of ways, and when you have talked a lot the emptier you get, and
get also in a position of corking. When I am situated like that, with
nothing to say, I feel as though I were a sort of fraud; I seem to be
playing a part, and please consider I am playing a part for want of
something better, and this, is not unfamiliar to me; I have often done
this before.</p>
<p>When I was here about eight years ago I was coming up in a car of the
elevated road. Very few people were in that car, and on one end of it
there was no one, except on the opposite seat, where sat a man about
fifty years old, with a most winning face and an elegant eye–a beautiful
eye; and I took him from his dress to be a master mechanic, a man who
had a vocation. He had with him a very fine little child of about four
or five years. I was watching the affection which existed between those
two. I judged he was the grandfather, perhaps. It was really a pretty
child, and I was admiring her, and as soon as he saw I was admiring her
he began to notice me.</p>
<p>I could see his admiration of me in his eye, and I did what everybody
else would do–admired the child four times as much, knowing I would get
four times as much of his admiration. Things went on very pleasantly. I
was making my way into his heart.</p>
<p>By-and-by, when he almost reached the station where he was to get
off, he got up, crossed over, and he said: “Now I am going to say
something to you which I hope you will regard as a compliment.“ And then
he went on to say: “I have never seen Mark Twain, but I have seen a
portrait of him, and any friend of mine will tell you that when I have
once seen a portrait of a man I place it in my eye and store it away in
my memory, and I can tell you now that you look enough like Mark Twain
to be his brother. Now,“ he said, “I hope you take this as a compliment.
Yes, you are a very good imitation; but when I come to look closer, you
are probably not that man.“</p>
<p>I said: “I will be frank with you. In my desire to look like that
excellent character I have dressed for the character; I have been
playing a part.“</p>
<p>He said: “That is all right, that is all right; you look very well on
the outside, but when it comes to the inside you are not in it with the
original“</p>
<p>So when I come to a place like this with nothing valuable to say I
always play a part. But I will say before I sit down that when it comes
to saying anything here I will express myself in this way: I am heartily
in sympathy with you in your efforts to help those who were sufferers in
this calamity, and in your desire to heap those who were rendered
homeless, and in saying this I wish to impress on you the fact that I am
not playing a part.</p>
