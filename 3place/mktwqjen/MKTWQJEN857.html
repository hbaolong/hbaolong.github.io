<h4 id="chapter-i-vienna-1899.">CHAPTER I VIENNA 1899.</h4>
<p>This last summer, when I was on my way back to Vienna from the
Appetite-Cure in the mountains, I fell over a cliff in the twilight, and
broke some arms and legs and one thing or another, and by good luck was
found by some peasants who had lost an ass, and they carried me to the
nearest habitation, which was one of those large, low, thatch-roofed
farm-houses, with apartments in the garret for the family, and a cunning
little porch under the deep gable decorated with boxes of bright colored
flowers and cats; on the ground floor a large and light sitting-room,
separated from the milch-cattle apartment by a partition; and in the
front yard rose stately and fine the wealth and pride of the house, the
manure-pile. That sentence is Germanic, and shows that I am acquiring
that sort of mastery of the art and spirit of the language which enables
a man to travel all day in one sentence without changing cars.</p>
<p>There was a village a mile away, and a horse doctor lived there, but
there was no surgeon. It seemed a bad outlook; mine was distinctly a
surgery case. Then it was remembered that a lady from Boston was
summering in that village, and she was a Christian Science doctor and
could cure anything. So she was sent for. It was night by this time, and
she could not conveniently come, but sent word that it was no matter,
there was no hurry, she would give me “absent treatment“ now, and come
in the morning; meantime she begged me to make myself tranquil and
comfortable and remember that there was nothing the matter with me. I
thought there must be some mistake.</p>
<p>“Did you tell her I walked off a cliff seventy-five feet high?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And struck a boulder at the bottom and bounced?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And struck another one and bounced again?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And struck another one and bounced yet again?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And broke the boulders?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“That accounts for it; she is thinking of the boulders. Why didn’t
you tell her I got hurt, too?“</p>
<p>“I did. I told her what you told me to tell her: that you were now
but an incoherent series of compound fractures extending from your
scalp-lock to your heels, and that the comminuted projections caused you
to look like a hat-rack.“</p>
<p>“And it was after this that she wished me to remember that there was
nothing the matter with me?“</p>
<p>“Those were her words.“</p>
<p>“I do not understand it. I believe she has not diagnosed the case
with sufficient care. Did she look like a person who was theorizing, or
did she look like one who has fallen off precipices herself and brings
to the aid of abstract science the confirmations of personal
experience?“</p>
<p>“Bitte?“</p>
<p>It was too large a contract for the Stubenmadchen’s vocabulary; she
couldn’t call the hand. I allowed the subject to rest there, and asked
for something to eat and smoke, and something hot to drink, and a basket
to pile my legs in; but I could not have any of these things.</p>
<p>“Why?“</p>
<p>“She said you would need nothing at all.“</p>
<p>“But I am hungry and thirsty, and in desperate pain.“</p>
<p>“She said you would have these delusions, but must pay no attention
to them. She wants you to particularly remember that there are no such
things as hunger and thirst and pain.’’</p>
<p>“She does does she?“</p>
<p>“It is what she said.“</p>
<p>Does she seem to be in full and functionable possession of her
intellectual plant, such as it is?“</p>
<p>“Bitte?“</p>
<p>“Do they let her run at large, or do they tie her up?“</p>
<p>“Tie her up?“</p>
<p>“There, good-night, run along, you are a good girl, but your mental
Geschirr is not arranged for light and airy conversation. Leave me to my
delusions.“</p>
