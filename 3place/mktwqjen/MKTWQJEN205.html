<h4 id="chapter-lxiii.">CHAPTER LXIII.</h4>
<p>It was evening when Philip took the cars at the Ilium station. The
news of, his success had preceded him, and while he waited for the
train, he was the center of a group of eager questioners, who asked him
a hundred things about the mine, and magnified his good fortune. There
was no mistake this time.</p>
<p>Philip, in luck, had become suddenly a person of consideration, whose
speech was freighted with meaning, whose looks were all significant. The
words of the proprietor of a rich coal mine have a golden sound, and his
common sayings are repeated as if they were solid wisdom.</p>
<p>Philip wished to be alone; his good fortune at this moment seemed an
empty mockery, one of those sarcasms of fate, such as that which spreads
a dainty banquet for the man who has no appetite. He had longed for
success principally for Ruth’s sake; and perhaps now, at this very
moment of his triumph, she was dying.</p>
<p>“Shust what I said, Mister Sederling,“ the landlord of the Ilium
hotel kept repeating. “I dold Jake Schmidt he find him dere shust so
sure as noting.“</p>
<p>“You ought to have taken a share, Mr. Dusenheimer,“ said Philip.</p>
<p>“Yaas, I know. But d’old woman, she say ’You sticks to your pisiness.
So I sticks to ’em. Und I makes noting. Dat Mister Prierly, he don’t
never come back here no more, ain’t it?“</p>
<p>“Why?“ asked Philip.</p>
<p>“Vell, dere is so many peers, and so many oder dhrinks, I got ’em all
set down, ven he coomes back.“</p>
<p>It was a long night for Philip, and a restless one. At any other time
the swing of the cars would have lulled him to sleep, and the rattle and
clank of wheels and rails, the roar of the whirling iron would have only
been cheerful reminders of swift and safe travel. Now they were voices
of warning and taunting; and instead of going rapidly the train seemed
to crawl at a snail’s pace. And it not only crawled, but it frequently
stopped; and when it stopped it stood dead still and there was an
ominous silence. Was anything the matter, he wondered. Only a station
probably. Perhaps, he thought, a telegraphic station. And then he
listened eagerly. Would the conductor open the door and ask for Philip
Sterling, and hand him a fatal dispatch?</p>
<p>How long they seemed to wait. And then slowly beginning to move, they
were off again, shaking, pounding, screaming through the night. He drew
his curtain from time to time and looked out. There was the lurid sky
line of the wooded range along the base of which they were crawling.
There was the Susquehannah, gleaming in the moon-light. There was a
stretch of level valley with silent farm houses, the occupants all at
rest, without trouble, without anxiety. There was a church, a graveyard,
a mill, a village; and now, without pause or fear, the train had mounted
a trestle-work high in air and was creeping along the top of it while a
swift torrent foamed a hundred feet below.</p>
<p>What would the morning bring? Even while he was flying to her, her
gentle spirit might have gone on another flight, whither he could not
follow her. He was full of foreboding. He fell at length into a restless
doze. There was a noise in his ears as of a rushing torrent when a
stream is swollen by a freshet in the spring. It was like the breaking
up of life; he was struggling in the consciousness of coming death: when
Ruth stood by his side, clothed in white, with a face like that of an
angel, radiant, smiling, pointing to the sky, and saying, “Come.“ He
awoke with a cry–the train was roaring through a bridge, and it shot out
into daylight.</p>
<p>When morning came the train was industriously toiling along through
the fat lands of Lancaster, with its broad farms of corn and wheat, its
mean houses of stone, its vast barns and granaries, built as if, for
storing the riches of Heliogabalus. Then came the smiling fields of
Chester, with their English green, and soon the county of Philadelphia
itself, and the increasing signs of the approach to a great city. Long
trains of coal cars, laden and unladen, stood upon sidings; the tracks
of other roads were crossed; the smoke of other locomotives was seen on
parallel lines; factories multiplied; streets appeared; the noise of a
busy city began to fill the air;–and with a slower and slower clank on
the connecting rails and interlacing switches the train rolled into the
station and stood still.</p>
<p>It was a hot August morning. The broad streets glowed in the sun, and
the white-shuttered houses stared at the hot thoroughfares like closed
bakers’ ovens set along the highway. Philip was oppressed with the heavy
air; the sweltering city lay as in a swoon. Taking a street car, he rode
away to the northern part of the city, the newer portion, formerly the
district of Spring Garden, for in this the Boltons now lived, in a small
brick house, befitting their altered fortunes.</p>
<p>He could scarcely restrain his impatience when he came in sight of
the house. The window shutters were not “bowed“; thank God, for that.
Ruth was still living, then. He ran up the steps and rang. Mrs. Bolton
met him at the door.</p>
<p>“Thee is very welcome, Philip.“</p>
<p>“And Ruth?“</p>
<p>“She is very ill, but quieter than, she has been, and the fever is a
little abating. The most dangerous time will be when the fever leaves
her. The doctor fears she will not have strength enough to rally from
it. Yes, thee can see her.“</p>
<p>Mrs. Bolton led the way to the little chamber where Ruth lay. “Oh,“
said her mother, “if she were only in her cool and spacious room in our
old home. She says that seems like heaven.“</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton sat by Ruth’s bedside, and he rose and silently pressed
Philip’s hand. The room had but one window; that was wide open to admit
the air, but the air that came in was hot and lifeless. Upon the table
stood a vase of flowers. Ruth’s eyes were closed; her cheeks were
flushed with fever, and she moved her head restlessly as if in pain.</p>
<p>“Ruth,“ said her mother, bending over her, “Philip is here.“</p>
<p>Ruth’s eyes unclosed, there was a gleam of recognition in them, there
was an attempt at a smile upon her face, and she tried to raise her thin
hand, as Philip touched her forehead with his lips; and he heard her
murmur,</p>
<p>“Dear Phil.“</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done but to watch and wait for the cruel
fever to burn itself out. Dr. Longstreet told Philip that the fever had
undoubtedly been contracted in the hospital, but it was not malignant,
and would be little dangerous if Ruth were not so worn down with work,
or if she had a less delicate constitution.</p>
<p>“It is only her indomitable will that has kept her up for weeks. And
if that should leave her now, there will be no hope. You can do more for
her now, sir, than I can?“</p>
<p>“How?“ asked Philip eagerly.</p>
<p>“Your presence, more than anything else, will inspire her with the
desire to live.“</p>
<p>When the fever turned, Ruth was in a very critical condition. For two
days her life was like the fluttering of a lighted candle in the wind.
Philip was constantly by her side, and she seemed to be conscious of his
presence, and to cling to him, as one borne away by a swift stream
clings to a stretched-out hand from the shore. If he was absent a moment
her restless eyes sought something they were disappointed not to
find.</p>
<p>Philip so yearned to bring her back to life, he willed it so strongly
and passionately, that his will appeared to affect hers and she seemed
slowly to draw life from his.</p>
<p>After two days of this struggle with the grasping enemy, it was
evident to Dr. Longstreet that Ruth’s will was beginning to issue its
orders to her body with some force, and that strength was slowly coming
back. In another day there was a decided improvement. As Philip sat
holding her weak hand and watching the least sign of resolution in her
face, Ruth was able to whisper,</p>
<p>“I so want to live, for you, Phil!“</p>
<p>“You will; darling, you must,“ said Philip in a tone of faith and
courage that carried a thrill of determination–of command–along all her
nerves.</p>
<p>Slowly Philip drew her back to life. Slowly she came back, as one
willing but well nigh helpless. It was new for Ruth to feel this
dependence on another’s nature, to consciously draw strength of will
from the will of another. It was a new but a dear joy, to be lifted up
and carried back into the happy world, which was now all aglow with the
light of love; to be lifted and carried by the one she loved more than
her own life.</p>
<p>“Sweetheart,“ she said to Philip, “I would not have cared to come
back but for thy love.“</p>
<p>“Not for thy profession?“</p>
<p>“Oh, thee may be glad enough of that some day, when thy coal bed is
dug out and thee and father are in the air again.“</p>
<p>When Ruth was able to ride she was taken into the country, for the
pure air was necessary to her speedy recovery. The family went with her.
Philip could not be spared from her side, and Mr. Bolton had gone up to
Ilium to look into that wonderful coal mine and to make arrangements for
developing it, and bringing its wealth to market. Philip had insisted on
re-conveying the Ilium property to Mr. Bolton, retaining only the share
originally contemplated for himself, and Mr. Bolton, therefore, once
more found himself engaged in business and a person of some consequence
in Third street. The mine turned out even better than was at first
hoped, and would, if judiciously managed, be a fortune to them all. This
also seemed to be the opinion of Mr. Bigler, who heard of it as soon as
anybody, and, with the impudence of his class called upon Mr. Bolton for
a little aid in a patent car-wheel he had bought an interest in. That
rascal, Small, he said, had swindled him out of all he had.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton told him he was very sorry, and recommended him to sue
Small.</p>
<p>Mr. Small also came with a similar story about Mr. Bigler; and
Mr. Bolton had the grace to give him like advice. And he added, “If you
and Bigler will procure the indictment of each other, you may have the
satisfaction of putting each other in the penitentiary for the forgery
of my acceptances.“</p>
<p>Bigler and Small did not quarrel however. They both attacked
Mr. Bolton behind his back as a swindler, and circulated the story that
he had made a fortune by failing.</p>
<p>In the pure air of the highlands, amid the golden glories of ripening
September, Ruth rapidly came back to health. How beautiful the world is
to an invalid, whose senses are all clarified, who has been so near the
world of spirits that she is sensitive to the finest influences, and
whose frame responds with a thrill to the subtlest ministrations of
soothing nature. Mere life is a luxury, and the color of the grass, of
the flowers, of the sky, the wind in the trees, the outlines of the
horizon, the forms of clouds, all give a pleasure as exquisite as the
sweetest music to the ear famishing for it. The world was all new and
fresh to Ruth, as if it had just been created for her, and love filled
it, till her heart was overflowing with happiness.</p>
<p>It was golden September also at Fallkill. And Alice sat by the open
window in her room at home, looking out upon the meadows where the
laborers were cutting the second crop of clover. The fragrance of it
floated to her nostrils. Perhaps she did not mind it. She was thinking.
She had just been writing to Ruth, and on the table before her was a
yellow piece of paper with a faded four-leaved clover pinned on it–only
a memory now. In her letter to Ruth she had poured out her heartiest
blessings upon them both, with her dear love forever and forever.</p>
<p>“Thank God,“ she said, “they will never know“</p>
<p>They never would know. And the world never knows how many women there
are like Alice, whose sweet but lonely lives of self-sacrifice, gentle,
faithful, loving souls, bless it continually.</p>
<p>“She is a dear girl,“ said Philip, when Ruth showed him the
letter.</p>
<p>“Yes, Phil, and we can spare a great deal of love for her, our own
lives are so full.“</p>
<p>APPENDIX.</p>
<p>Perhaps some apology to the reader is necessary in view of our
failure to find Laura’s father. We supposed, from the ease with which
lost persons are found in novels, that it would not be difficult. But it
was; indeed, it was impossible; and therefore the portions of the
narrative containing the record of the search have been stricken out.
Not because they were not interesting–for they were; but inasmuch as the
man was not found, after all, it did not seem wise to harass and excite
the reader to no purpose.</p>
