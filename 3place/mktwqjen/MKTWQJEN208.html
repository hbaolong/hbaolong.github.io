<h4 id="political-economy">POLITICAL ECONOMY</h4>
<p>Political Economy is the basis of all good government. The wisest men
of all ages have brought to bear upon this subject the–</p>
<p>[Here I was interrupted and informed that a stranger wished to see me
down at the door. I went and confronted him, and asked to know his
business, struggling all the time to keep a tight rein on my seething
political-economy ideas, and not let them break away from me or get
tangled in their harness. And privately I wished the stranger was in the
bottom of the canal with a cargo of wheat on top of him. I was all in a
fever, but he was cool. He said he was sorry to disturb me, but as he
was passing he noticed that I needed some lightning-rods. I said, “Yes,
yes–go on–what about it?“ He said there was nothing about it, in
particular–nothing except that he would like to put them up for me. I am
new to housekeeping; have been used to hotels and boarding-houses all my
life. Like anybody else of similar experience, I try to appear (to
strangers) to be an old housekeeper; consequently I said in an offhand
way that I had been intending for some time to have six or eight
lightning-rods put up, but–The stranger started, and looked inquiringly
at me, but I was serene. I thought that if I chanced to make any
mistakes, he would not catch me by my countenance. He said he would
rather have my custom than any man’s in town. I said, “All right,“ and
started off to wrestle with my great subject again, when he called me
back and said it would be necessary to know exactly how many “points“ I
wanted put up, what parts of the house I wanted them on, and what
quality of rod I preferred. It was close quarters for a man not used to
the exigencies of housekeeping; but I went through creditably, and he
probably never suspected that I was a novice. I told him to put up eight
“points,“ and put them all on the roof, and use the best quality of rod.
He said he could furnish the “plain“ article at 20 cents a foot;
“coppered,“ 25 cents; “zinc-plated spiral-twist,“ at 30 cents, that
would stop a streak of lightning any time, no matter where it was bound,
and “render its errand harmless and its further progress apocryphal.“ I
said apocryphal was no slouch of a word, emanating from the source it
did, but, philology aside, I liked the spiral-twist and would take that
brand. Then he said he could make two hundred and fifty feet answer; but
to do it right, and make the best job in town of it, and attract the
admiration of the just and the unjust alike, and compel all parties to
say they never saw a more symmetrical and hypothetical display of
lightning-rods since they were born, he supposed he really couldn’t get
along without four hundred, though he was not vindictive, and trusted he
was willing to try. I said, go ahead and use four hundred, and make any
kind of a job he pleased out of it, but let me get back to my work. So I
got rid of him at last; and now, after half an hour spent in getting my
train of political-economy thoughts coupled together again, I am ready
to go on once more.]</p>
<p>richest treasures of their genius, their experience of life, and
their learning. The great lights of commercial jurisprudence,
international confraternity, and biological deviation, of all ages, all
civilizations, and all nationalities, from Zoroaster down to Horace
Greeley, have–</p>
<p>[Here I was interrupted again, and required to go down and confer
further with that lightning-rod man. I hurried off, boiling and surging
with prodigious thoughts wombed in words of such majesty that each one
of them was in itself a straggling procession of syllables that might be
fifteen minutes passing a given point, and once more I confronted him–he
so calm and sweet, I so hot and frenzied. He was standing in the
contemplative attitude of the Colossus of Rhodes, with one foot on my
infant tuberose, and the other among my pansies, his hands on his hips,
his hat-brim tilted forward, one eye shut and the other gazing
critically and admiringly in the direction of my principal chimney. He
said now there was a state of things to make a man glad to be alive; and
added, “I leave it to you if you ever saw anything more deliriously
picturesque than eight lightning-rods on one chimney?“ I said I had no
present recollection of anything that transcended it. He said that in
his opinion nothing on earth but Niagara Falls was superior to it in the
way of natural scenery. All that was needed now, he verily believed, to
make my house a perfect balm to the eye, was to kind of touch up the
other chimneys a little, and thus “add to the generous ‘coup d’oeil’ a
soothing uniformity of achievement which would allay the excitement
naturally consequent upon the ‘coup d’etat.’“ I asked him if he learned
to talk out of a book, and if I could borrow it anywhere? He smiled
pleasantly, and said that his manner of speaking was not taught in
books, and that nothing but familiarity with lightning could enable a
man to handle his conversational style with impunity. He then figured up
an estimate, and said that about eight more rods scattered about my roof
would about fix me right, and he guessed five hundred feet of stuff
would do it; and added that the first eight had got a little the start
of him, so to speak, and used up a mere trifle of material more than he
had calculated on–a hundred feet or along there. I said I was in a
dreadful hurry, and I wished we could get this business permanently
mapped out, so that I could go on with my work. He said, “I could have
put up those eight rods, and marched off about my business–some men
would have done it. But no; I said to myself, this man is a stranger to
me, and I will die before I’ll wrong him; there ain’t lightning-rods
enough on that house, and for one I’ll never stir out of my tracks till
I’ve done as I would be done by, and told him so. Stranger, my duty is
accomplished; if the recalcitrant and dephlogistic messenger of heaven
strikes your–“ “There, now, there,“ I said, “put on the other eight–add
five hundred feet of spiral-twist–do anything and everything you want to
do; but calm your sufferings, and try to keep your feelings where you
can reach them with the dictionary. Meanwhile, if we understand each
other now, I will go to work again.“</p>
<p>I think I have been sitting here a full hour this time, trying to get
back to where I was when my train of thought was broken up by the last
interruption; but I believe I have accomplished it at last, and may
venture to proceed again.]</p>
<p>wrestled with this great subject, and the greatest among them have
found it a worthy adversary, and one that always comes up fresh and
smiling after every throw. The great Confucius said that he would rather
be a profound political economist than chief of police. Cicero
frequently said that political economy was the grandest consummation
that the human mind was capable of consuming; and even our own Greeley
had said vaguely but forcibly that “Political–</p>
<p>[Here the lightning-rod man sent up another call for me. I went down
in a state of mind bordering on impatience. He said he would rather have
died than interrupt me, but when he was employed to do a job, and that
job was expected to be done in a clean, workmanlike manner, and when it
was finished and fatigue urged him to seek the rest and recreation he
stood so much in need of, and he was about to do it, but looked up and
saw at a glance that all the calculations had been a little out, and if
a thunder-storm were to come up, and that house, which he felt a
personal interest in, stood there with nothing on earth to protect it
but sixteen lightning-rods–“Let us have peace!“ I shrieked. “Put up a
hundred and fifty! Put some on the kitchen! Put a dozen on the barn! Put
a couple on the cow! Put one on the cook!–scatter them all over the
persecuted place till it looks like a zinc-plated, spiral-twisted,
silver-mounted canebrake! Move! Use up all the material you can get your
hands on, and when you run out of lightning-rods put up ramrods,
cam-rods, stair-rods, piston-rods–anything that will pander to your
dismal appetite for artificial scenery, and bring respite to my raging
brain and healing to my lacerated soul!“ Wholly unmoved–further than to
smile sweetly–this iron being simply turned back his wrist-bands
daintily, and said he would now proceed to hump himself. Well, all that
was nearly three hours ago. It is questionable whether I am calm enough
yet to write on the noble theme of political economy, but I cannot
resist the desire to try, for it is the one subject that is nearest to
my heart and dearest to my brain of all this world’s philosophy.]</p>
<p>economy is heaven’s best boon to man.“ When the loose but gifted
Byron lay in his Venetian exile he observed that, if it could be granted
him to go back and live his misspent life over again, he would give his
lucid and unintoxicated intervals to the composition, not of frivolous
rhymes, but of essays upon political economy. Washington loved this
exquisite science; such names as Baker, Beckwith, Judson, Smith, are
imperishably linked with it; and even imperial Homer, in the ninth book
of the Iliad, has said:</p>
<p>Fiat justitia, ruat coelum, Post mortem unum, ante bellum, Hic facet
hoc, ex-parte res, Politicum e-conomico est.</p>
<p>The grandeur of these conceptions of the old poet, together with the
felicity of the wording which clothes them, and the sublimity of the
imagery whereby they are illustrated, have singled out that stanza, and
made it more celebrated than any that ever–</p>
<p>[“Now, not a word out of you–not a single word. Just state your bill
and relapse into impenetrable silence for ever and ever on these
premises. Nine hundred, dollars? Is that all? This check for the amount
will be honored at any respectable bank in America. What is that
multitude of people gathered in the street for? How?–‘looking at the
lightning-rods!’ Bless my life, did they never see any lightning-rods
before? Never saw ‘such a stack of them on one establishment,’ did I
understand you to say? I will step down and critically observe this
popular ebullition of ignorance.“]</p>
<p>THREE DAYS LATER.–We are all about worn out. For four-and-twenty
hours our bristling premises were the talk and wonder of the town. The
theaters languished, for their happiest scenic inventions were tame and
commonplace compared with my lightning-rods. Our street was blocked
night and day with spectators, and among them were many who came from
the country to see. It was a blessed relief on the second day when a
thunderstorm came up and the lightning began to “go for“ my house, as
the historian Josephus quaintly phrases it. It cleared the galleries, so
to speak. In five minutes there was not a spectator within half a mile
of my place; but all the high houses about that distance away were full,
windows, roof, and all. And well they might be, for all the falling
stars and Fourth-of-July fireworks of a generation, put together and
rained down simultaneously out of heaven in one brilliant shower upon
one helpless roof, would not have any advantage of the pyrotechnic
display that was making my house so magnificently conspicuous in the
general gloom of the storm.</p>
<p>By actual count, the lightning struck at my establishment seven
hundred and sixty-four times in forty minutes, but tripped on one of
those faithful rods every time, and slid down the spiral-twist and shot
into the earth before it probably had time to be surprised at the way
the thing was done. And through all that bombardment only one patch of
slates was ripped up, and that was because, for a single instant, the
rods in the vicinity were transporting all the lightning they could
possibly accommodate. Well, nothing was ever seen like it since the
world began. For one whole day and night not a member of my family stuck
his head out of the window but he got the hair snatched off it as smooth
as a billiard-ball; and; if the reader will believe me, not one of us
ever dreamt of stirring abroad. But at last the awful siege came to an
end-because there was absolutely no more electricity left in the clouds
above us within grappling distance of my insatiable rods. Then I sallied
forth, and gathered daring workmen together, and not a bite or a nap did
we take till the premises were utterly stripped of all their terrific
armament except just three rods on the house, one on the kitchen, and
one on the barn–and, behold, these remain there even unto this day. And
then, and not till then, the people ventured to use our street again. I
will remark here, in passing, that during that fearful time I did not
continue my essay upon political economy. I am not even yet settled
enough in nerve and brain to resume it.</p>
<p>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.–Parties having need of three thousand two
hundred and eleven feet of best quality zinc-plated spiral-twist
lightning-rod stuff, and sixteen hundred and thirty-one silver-tipped
points, all in tolerable repair (and, although much worn by use, still
equal to any ordinary emergency), can hear of a bargains by addressing
the publisher.</p>
<p>THE JUMPING FROG [written about 1865]</p>
<p>IN ENGLISH. THEN IN FRENCH. THEN CLAWED BACK INTO A CIVILIZED
LANGUAGE ONCE MORE BY PATIENT, UNREMUNERATED TOIL.</p>
<p>Even a criminal is entitled to fair play; and certainly when a man
who has done no harm has been unjustly treated, he is privileged to do
his best to right himself. My attention has just beep called to an
article some three years old in a French Magazine entitled, ‘Revue des
Deux Mondes’ (Review of Some Two Worlds), wherein the writer treats of
“Les Humoristes Americaines“ (These Humorist Americans). I am one of
these humorists American dissected by him, and hence the complaint I am
making.</p>
<p>This gentleman’s article is an able one (as articles go, in the
French, where they always tangle up everything to that degree that when
you start into a sentence you never know whether you are going to come
out alive or not). It is a very good article and the writer says all
manner of kind and complimentary things about me–for which I am sure
thank him with all my heart; but then why should he go and spoil all his
praise by one unlucky experiment? What I refer to is this: he says my
jumping Frog is a funny story, but still he can’t see why it should ever
really convulse any one with laughter–and straightway proceeds to
translate it into French in order to prove to his nation that there is
nothing so very extravagantly funny about it. Just there is where my
complaint originates. He has not translated it at all; he has simply
mixed it all up; it is no more like the jumping Frog when he gets
through with it than I am like a meridian of longitude. But my mere
assertion is not proof; wherefore I print the French version, that all
may see that I do not speak falsely; furthermore, in order that even the
unlettered may know my injury and give me their compassion, I have been
at infinite pains and trouble to retranslate this French version back
into English; and to tell the truth I have well-nigh worn myself out at
it, having scarcely rested from my work during five days and nights. I
cannot speak the French language, but I can translate very well, though
not fast, I being self-educated. I ask the reader to run his eye over
the original English version of the jumping Frog, and then read the
French or my retranslation, and kindly take notice how the Frenchman has
riddled the grammar. I think it is the worst I ever saw; and yet the
French are called a polished nation. If I had a boy that put sentences
together as they do, I would polish him to some purpose. Without further
introduction, the jumping Frog, as I originally wrote it, was as follows
[after it will be found the French version–(French version is deleted
from this edition)–, and after the latter my retranslation from the
French]</p>
<p>THE NOTORIOUS JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY [Pronounced
Cal-e-va-ras]</p>
<p>In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from
the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and
inquired after my friend’s friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to
do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that
Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth that my friend never knew such a personage;
and that he on conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him, it
would remind him of his infamous Jim Smiley, and he would go to work and
bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence him as long and as
tedious as it should be useless to me. If that was the design, it
succeeded.</p>
<p>I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the
dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp Angel’s, and I noticed
that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of winning
gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up,
and gave me good day. I told him that a friend of mine had commissioned
me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood
named Leonidas W. Smiley–Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, a young minister of
the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time resident of Angel’s Camp. I
added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about this
Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him.</p>
<p>Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his
chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which
follows this paragraph. He never smiled he never frowned, he never
changed his voice from the gentle flowing key to which he tuned his
initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of
enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein
of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that,
so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny
about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and
admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in ‘finesse.’ I let
him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.</p>
<p>“Rev. Leonidas W. H’m, Reverend Le–well, there was a feller here,
once by the name of Jim Smiley, in the winter of ‘49–or maybe it was the
spring of ’50–I don’t recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me
think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume warn’t
finished when he first come to the camp; but anyway, he was the
curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever
see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he
couldn’t he’d change sides. Any way that suited the other man would suit
him any way just so’s he got a bet, he was satisfied. But still he was
lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He was always
ready and laying for a chance; there couldn’t be no solit’ry thing
mentioned but that feller’d offer to bet on it, and take any side you
please, as I was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, you’d find
him flush or you’d find him busted at the end of it; if there was a
dog-fight, he’d bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he’d bet on it; if
there was a chicken-fight, he’d bet on it; why, if there was two birds
setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if
there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg’lar to bet on Parson
Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so he
was too, and a good man. If he even see a straddle-bug start to go
anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get to–to
wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that
straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for
and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that
Smiley, and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no difference to
him–he’d bet on any thing–the dangdest feller. Parson Walker’s wife laid
very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn’t going
to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how
she was, and he said she was considerable better–thank the Lord for his
inf’nite mercy–and coming on so smart that with the blessing of
Prov’dence she’d get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says,
’Well, I’ll resk two-and-a-half she don’t anyway.’</p>
<p>“Thish-yer Smiley had a mare–the boys called her the fifteen-minute
nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because of course she was
faster than that–and he used to win money on that horse, for all she was
so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption,
or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred
yards’ start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag end of
the race she get excited and desperate like, and come cavorting and
straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the
air, and sometimes out to one side among the fences, and kicking up
m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing
and blowing her nose–and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck
ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.</p>
<p>“And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you’d think
he warn’t worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a
chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was a
different dog; his under-jaw’d begin to stick out like the fo’castle of
a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces.
And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw
him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson–which was
the name of the pup–Andrew Jackson would never let on but what he was
satisfied, and hadn’t expected nothing else–and the bets being doubled
and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up;
and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j’int
of his hind leg and freeze to it–not chaw, you understand, but only just
grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was a year.
Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog once
that didn’t have no hind legs, because they’d been sawed off in a
circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the
money was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt, he see
in a minute how he’d been imposed on, and how the other dog had him in
the door, so to speak, and he ’peared surprised, and then he looked
sorter discouraged-like and didn’t try no more to win the fight, and so
he got shucked out bad. He give Smiley a look, as much as to say his
heart was broke, and it was his fault, for putting up a dog that hadn’t
no hind legs for him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a
fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a
good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for
hisself if he’d lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius–I know
it, because he hadn’t no opportunities to speak of, and it don’t stand
to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them
circumstances if he hadn’t no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when
I think of that last fight of his’n, and the way it turned out.</p>
<p>“Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and
tomcats and all them kind of things, till you couldn’t rest, and you
couldn’t fetch nothing for him to bet on but he’d match you. He ketched
a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal’lated to educate him;
and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard
and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn him, too. He’d
give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you’d see that frog
whirling in the air like a doughnut–see him turn one summerset, or maybe
a couple, if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all
right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and
kep’ him in practice so constant, that he’d nail a fly every time as fur
as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he
could do ‘most anything–and I believe him. Why, I’ve seen him set Dan’l
Webster down here on this floor–Dan’l Webster was the name of the
frog–and sing out, ’Flies, Dan’l, flies!’ and quicker’n you could wink
he’d spring straight up and snake a fly off’n the counter there, and
flop down on the floor ag’in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to
scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if
he hadn’t no idea he’d been doin’ any more’n any frog might do. You
never see a frog so modest and straightfor’ard as he was, for all he was
so gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level,
he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his
breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you
understand; and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him
as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and
well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres all
said he laid over any frog that ever they see.</p>
<p>“Well, Smiley kep’ the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to
fetch him down-town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller –a
stranger in the camp, he was–come acrost him with his box, and says:</p>
<p>“‘What might it be that you’ve got in the box?’</p>
<p>“And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, ‘It might be a parrot, or
it might be a canary, maybe, but it ain’t–it’s only just a frog.’</p>
<p>“And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it
round this way and that, and says, ’H’m–so ’tis. Well, what’s HE good
for.</p>
<p>“‘Well,’ Smiley says, easy and careless, ’he’s good enough for one
thing, I should judge–he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.</p>
<p>“The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular
look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, ‘Well,’ he
says, ‘I don’t see no pints about that frog that’s any better’n any
other frog.’</p>
<p>“‘Maybe you don’t,’ Smiley says. ‘Maybe you understand frogs and
maybe you don’t understand ’em; maybe you’ve had experience, and maybe
you ain’t only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I’ve got my opinion, and
I’ll resk forty dollars the he can outjump any frog in Calaveras
County.’</p>
<p>“And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad-like,
’Well, I’m only a, stranger here, and I ain’t got no frog; but if I had
a frog, I’d bet you.</p>
<p>“And then Smiley says, ‘That’s all right–that’s all right if you’ll
hold my box a minute, I’ll go and get you a frog.’ Any so the feller
took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley’s, and set
down to wait.</p>
<p>“So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to himself and
then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon
and filled him full of quail-shot-filled him pretty near up to his
chin–and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped
around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and
fetched him in, and give him to this feller and says:</p>
<p>“‘Now, if you’re ready, set him alongside of Dan’l, with his fore
paws just even with Dan’l’s, and I’ll give the word.’ Then he says,
‘One-two-three–git’ and him and the feller touches up the frogs from
behind, and the new frog hopped off lively but Dan’l give a heave, and
hysted up his shoulders—so-like a Frenchman, but it warn’t no use–he
couldn’t budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn’t no
more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised,
and he was disgusted too, but he didn’t have no idea what the matter was
of course.</p>
<p>“The Teller took the money and started away; and when he was going
out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder–so–at
Dan’l, and says again, very deliberate, ‘Well,’ he says, ‘I don’t see no
pints about that frog that’s any better’n any other frog.’</p>
<p>“Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan’l a long
time, and at last he says, ‘I do wonder what in the nation that frog
throw’d off for–I wonder if there ain’t something the matter with him
–he ’pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.’ And he ketched Dan’l by the
nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, ‘Why blame my cats if he
don’t weigh five pound!’ and turned him upside down and he belched out a
double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the
maddest man –he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he
never ketched him. And–“</p>
<p>[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and
got up to see what was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he
said: “Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy–I ain’t going to
be gone a second.“</p>
<p>But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the
history of the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to
afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and
so I started away.</p>
<p>At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed
me and recommenced:</p>
<p>“Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed cow that didn’t have no
tail, only just a short stump like a bannanner, and–“</p>
<p>However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear
about the afflicted cow, but took my leave.</p>
<p>Now let the learned look upon this picture and say if iconoclasm can
further go:</p>
