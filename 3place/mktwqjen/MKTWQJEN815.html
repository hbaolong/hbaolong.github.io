<h4 id="chapter">CHAPTER</h4>
<p>XWas it Heaven? Or Hell?</p>
<h2 id="a-cure-for-the-blues">A CURE FOR THE BLUES</h2>
<p>By courtesy of Mr. Cable I came into possession of a singular book
eight or ten years ago. It is likely that mine is now the only copy in
existence. Its title-page, unabbreviated, reads as follows:</p>
<p>“The Enemy Conquered; or, Love Triumphant. By G. Ragsdale McClintock,
[1] author of ‘An Address,’ etc., delivered at Sunflower Hill, South
Carolina, and member of the Yale Law School. New Haven: published by T.
H. Pease, 83 Chapel Street, 1845.“</p>
<p>No one can take up this book and lay it down again unread. Whoever
reads one line of it is caught, is chained; he has become the contented
slave of its fascinations; and he will read and read, devour and devour,
and will not let it go out of his hand till it is finished to the last
line, though the house be on fire over his head. And after a first
reading he will not throw it aside, but will keep it by him, with his
Shakespeare and his Homer, and will take it up many and many a time,
when the world is dark and his spirits are low, and be straightway
cheered and refreshed. Yet this work has been allowed to lie wholly
neglected, unmentioned, and apparently unregretted, for nearly half a
century.</p>
<p>The reader must not imagine that he is to find in it wisdom,
brilliancy, fertility of invention, ingenuity of construction,
excellence of form, purity of style, perfection of imagery, truth to
nature, clearness of statement, humanly possible situations, humanly
possible people, fluent narrative, connected sequence of events –or
philosophy, or logic, or sense. No; the rich, deep, beguiling charm of
the book lies in the total and miraculous ABSENCE from it of all these
qualities–a charm which is completed and perfected by the evident fact
that the author, whose naive innocence easily and surely wins our
regard, and almost our worship, does not know that they are absent, does
not even suspect that they are absent. When read by the light of these
helps to an understanding of the situation, the book is
delicious–profoundly and satisfyingly delicious.</p>
<p>I call it a book because the author calls it a book, I call it a work
because he calls it a work; but, in truth, it is merely a duodecimo
pamphlet of thirty-one pages. It was written for fame and money, as the
author very frankly–yes, and very hopefully, too, poor fellow –says in
his preface. The money never came–no penny of it ever came; and how
long, how pathetically long, the fame has been deferred –forty-seven
years! He was young then, it would have been so much to him then; but
will he care for it now?</p>
<p>As time is measured in America, McClintock’s epoch is antiquity. In
his long-vanished day the Southern author had a passion for “eloquence“;
it was his pet, his darling. He would be eloquent, or perish. And he
recognized only one kind of eloquence–the lurid, the tempestuous, the
volcanic. He liked words–big words, fine words, grand words, rumbling,
thundering, reverberating words; with sense attaching if it could be got
in without marring the sound, but not otherwise. He loved to stand up
before a dazed world, and pour forth flame and smoke and lava and
pumice-stone into the skies, and work his subterranean thunders, and
shake himself with earthquakes, and stench himself with sulphur fumes.
If he consumed his own fields and vineyards, that was a pity, yes; but
he would have his eruption at any cost. Mr. McClintock’s eloquence –and
he is always eloquent, his crater is always spouting–is of the pattern
common to his day, but he departs from the custom of the time in one
respect: his brethren allowed sense to intrude when it did not mar the
sound, but he does not allow it to intrude at all. For example, consider
this figure, which he used in the village “Address“ referred to with
such candid complacency in the title-page above quoted–“like the topmost
topaz of an ancient tower.“ Please read it again; contemplate it;
measure it; walk around it; climb up it; try to get at an approximate
realization of the size of it. Is the fellow to that to be found in
literature, ancient or modern, foreign or domestic, living or dead,
drunk or sober? One notices how fine and grand it sounds. We know that
if it was loftily uttered, it got a noble burst of applause from the
villagers; yet there isn’t a ray of sense in it, or meaning to it.</p>
<p>McClintock finished his education at Yale in 1843, and came to
Hartford on a visit that same year. I have talked with men who at that
time talked with him, and felt of him, and knew he was real. One needs
to remember that fact and to keep fast hold of it; it is the only way to
keep McClintock’s book from undermining one’s faith in McClintock’s
actuality.</p>
<p>As to the book. The first four pages are devoted to an inflamed
eulogy of Woman–simply woman in general, or perhaps as an institution
–wherein, among other compliments to her details, he pays a unique one
to her voice. He says it “fills the breast with fond alarms, echoed by
every rill.“ It sounds well enough, but it is not true. After the eulogy
he takes up his real work and the novel begins. It begins in the woods,
near the village of Sunflower Hill.</p>
<p>Brightening clouds seemed to rise from the mist of the fair
Chattahoochee, to spread their beauty over the thick forest, to guide
the hero whose bosom beats with aspirations to conquer the enemy that
would tarnish his name, and to win back the admiration of his long-tried
friend.</p>
<p>It seems a general remark, but it is not general; the hero mentioned
is the to-be hero of the book; and in this abrupt fashion, and without
name or description, he is shoveled into the tale. “With aspirations to
conquer the enemy that would tarnish his name“ is merely a phrase flung
in for the sake of the sound–let it not mislead the reader. No one is
trying to tarnish this person; no one has thought of it. The rest of the
sentence is also merely a phrase; the man has no friend as yet, and of
course has had no chance to try him, or win back his admiration, or
disturb him in any other way.</p>
<p>The hero climbs up over “Sawney’s Mountain,“ and down the other side,
making for an old Indian “castle“–which becomes “the red man’s hut“ in
the next sentence; and when he gets there at last, he “surveys with
wonder and astonishment“ the invisible structure, “which time has buried
in the dust, and thought to himself his happiness was not yet complete.“
One doesn’t know why it wasn’t, nor how near it came to being complete,
nor what was still wanting to round it up and make it so. Maybe it was
the Indian; but the book does not say. At this point we have an
episode:</p>
<p>Beside the shore of the brook sat a young man, about eighteen or
twenty, who seemed to be reading some favorite book, and who had a
remarkably noble countenance–eyes which betrayed more than a common
mind. This of course made the youth a welcome guest, and gained him
friends in whatever condition of his life he might be placed. The
traveler observed that he was a well-built figure which showed strength
and grace in every movement. He accordingly addressed him in quite a
gentlemanly manner, and inquired of him the way to the village. After he
had received the desired information, and was about taking his leave,
the youth said, “Are you not Major Elfonzo, the great musician [2]–the
champion of a noble cause –the modern Achilles, who gained so many
victories in the Florida War?“ “I bear that name,“ said the Major, “and
those titles, trusting at the same time that the ministers of grace will
carry me triumphantly through all my laudable undertakings, and if,“
continued the Major, “you, sir, are the patronizer of noble deeds, I
should like to make you my confidant and learn your address.“ The youth
looked somewhat amazed, bowed low, mused for a moment, and began: “My
name is Roswell. I have been recently admitted to the bar, and can only
give a faint outline of my future success in that honorable profession;
but I trust, sir, like the Eagle, I shall look down from the lofty rocks
upon the dwellings of man, and shall ever be ready to give you any
assistance in my official capacity, and whatever this muscular arm of
mine can do, whenever it shall be called from its buried GREATNESS.“ The
Major grasped him by the hand, and exclaimed: “O! thou exalted spirit of
inspiration–thou flame of burning prosperity, may the Heaven-directed
blaze be the glare of thy soul, and battle down every rampart that seems
to impede your progress!“</p>
<p>There is a strange sort of originality about McClintock; he imitates
other people’s styles, but nobody can imitate his, not even an idiot.
Other people can be windy, but McClintock blows a gale; other people can
blubber sentiment, but McClintock spews it; other people can mishandle
metaphors, but only McClintock knows how to make a business of it.
McClintock is always McClintock, he is always consistent, his style is
always his own style. He does not make the mistake of being relevant on
one page and irrelevant on another; he is irrelevant on all of them. He
does not make the mistake of being lucid in one place and obscure in
another; he is obscure all the time. He does not make the mistake of
slipping in a name here and there that is out of character with his
work; he always uses names that exactly and fantastically fit his
lunatics. In the matter of undeviating consistency he stands alone in
authorship. It is this that makes his style unique, and entitles it to a
name of its own–McClintockian. It is this that protects it from being
mistaken for anybody else’s. Uncredited quotations from other writers
often leave a reader in doubt as to their authorship, but McClintock is
safe from that accident; an uncredited quotation from him would always
be recognizable. When a boy nineteen years old, who had just been
admitted to the bar, says, “I trust, sir, like the Eagle, I shall look
down from lofty rocks upon the dwellings of man,“ we know who is
speaking through that boy; we should recognize that note anywhere. There
be myriads of instruments in this world’s literary orchestra, and a
multitudinous confusion of sounds that they make, wherein fiddles are
drowned, and guitars smothered, and one sort of drum mistaken for
another sort; but whensoever the brazen note of the McClintockian
trombone breaks through that fog of music, that note is recognizable,
and about it there can be no blur of doubt.</p>
<p>The novel now arrives at the point where the Major goes home to see
his father. When McClintock wrote this interview he probably believed it
was pathetic.</p>
<p>The road which led to the town presented many attractions Elfonzo had
bid farewell to the youth of deep feeling, and was now wending his way
to the dreaming spot of his fondness. The south winds whistled through
the woods, as the waters dashed against the banks, as rapid fire in the
pent furnace roars. This brought him to remember while alone, that he
quietly left behind the hospitality of a father’s house, and gladly
entered the world, with higher hopes than are often realized. But as he
journeyed onward, he was mindful of the advice of his father, who had
often looked sadly on the ground, when tears of cruelly deceived hope
moistened his eyes. Elfonzo had been somewhat a dutiful son; yet fond of
the amusements of life –had been in distant lands–had enjoyed the
pleasure of the world, and had frequently returned to the scenes of his
boyhood, almost destitute of many of the comforts of life. In this
condition, he would frequently say to his father, “Have I offended you,
that you look upon me as a stranger, and frown upon me with stinging
looks? Will you not favor me with the sound of your voice? If I have
trampled upon your veneration, or have spread a humid veil of darkness
around your expectations, send me back into the world, where no heart
beats for me–where the foot of man had never yet trod; but give me at
least one kind word–allow me to come into the presence sometimes of thy
winter-worn locks.“ “Forbid it, Heaven, that I should be angry with
thee,“ answered the father, “my son, and yet I send thee back to the
children of the world–to the cold charity of the combat, and to a land
of victory. I read another destiny in thy countenance–I learn thy
inclinations from the flame that has already kindled in my soul a
strange sensation. It will seek thee, my dear ELFONZO, it will find
thee–thou canst not escape that lighted torch, which shall blot out from
the remembrance of men a long train of prophecies which they have
foretold against thee. I once thought not so. Once, I was blind; but now
the path of life is plain before me, and my sight is clear; yet,
Elfonzo, return to thy worldly occupation–take again in thy hand that
chord of sweet sounds –struggle with the civilized world and with your
own heart; fly swiftly to the enchanted ground–let the night-OWL send
forth its screams from the stubborn oak–let the sea sport upon the
beach, and the stars sing together; but learn of these, Elfonzo, thy
doom, and thy hiding-place. Our most innocent as well as our most lawful
DESIRES must often be denied us, that we may learn to sacrifice them to
a Higher will.“</p>
<p>Remembering such admonitions with gratitude, Elfonzo was immediately
urged by the recollection of his father’s family to keep moving.</p>
<p>McClintock has a fine gift in the matter of surprises; but as a rule
they are not pleasant ones, they jar upon the feelings. His closing
sentence in the last quotation is of that sort. It brings one down out
of the tinted clouds in too sudden and collapsed a fashion. It incenses
one against the author for a moment. It makes the reader want to take
him by this winter-worn locks, and trample on his veneration, and
deliver him over to the cold charity of combat, and blot him out with
his own lighted torch. But the feeling does not last. The master takes
again in his hand that concord of sweet sounds of his, and one is
reconciled, pacified.</p>
<p>His steps became quicker and quicker–he hastened through the PINY
woods, dark as the forest was, and with joy he very soon reached the
little village of repose, in whose bosom rested the boldest chivalry.
His close attention to every important object–his modest questions about
whatever was new to him–his reverence for wise old age, and his ardent
desire to learn many of the fine arts, soon brought him into respectable
notice.</p>
<p>One mild winter day, as he walked along the streets toward the
Academy, which stood upon a small eminence, surrounded by native growth
–some venerable in its appearance, others young and prosperous –all
seemed inviting, and seemed to be the very place for learning as well as
for genius to spend its research beneath its spreading shades. He
entered its classic walls in the usual mode of southern manners.</p>
<p>The artfulness of this man! None knows so well as he how to pique the
curiosity of the reader–and how to disappoint it. He raises the hope,
here, that he is going to tell all about how one enters a classic wall
in the usual mode of Southern manners; but does he? No; he smiles in his
sleeve, and turns aside to other matters.</p>
<p>The principal of the Institution begged him to be seated and listen
to the recitations that were going on. He accordingly obeyed the
request, and seemed to be much pleased. After the school was dismissed,
and the young hearts regained their freedom, with the songs of the
evening, laughing at the anticipated pleasures of a happy home, while
others tittered at the actions of the past day, he addressed the teacher
in a tone that indicated a resolution –with an undaunted mind. He said
he had determined to become a student, if he could meet with his
approbation. “Sir,“ said he, “I have spent much time in the world. I
have traveled among the uncivilized inhabitants of America. I have met
with friends, and combated with foes; but none of these gratify my
ambition, or decide what is to be my destiny. I see the learned world
have an influence with the voice of the people themselves. The
despoilers of the remotest kingdoms of the earth refer their differences
to this class of persons. This the illiterate and inexperienced little
dream of; and now if you will receive me as I am, with these
deficiencies–with all my misguided opinions, I will give you my honor,
sir, that I will never disgrace the Institution, or those who have
placed you in this honorable station.“ The instructor, who had met with
many disappointments, knew how to feel for a stranger who had been thus
turned upon the charities of an unfeeling community. He looked at him
earnestly, and said: “Be of good cheer–look forward, sir, to the high
destination you may attain. Remember, the more elevated the mark at
which you aim, the more sure, the more glorious, the more magnificent
the prize.“ From wonder to wonder, his encouragement led the impatient
listener. A strange nature bloomed before him–giant streams promised him
success–gardens of hidden treasures opened to his view. All this, so
vividly described, seemed to gain a new witchery from his glowing
fancy.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this situation is new in romance. I feel sure it
has not been attempted before. Military celebrities have been disguised
and set at lowly occupations for dramatic effect, but I think McClintock
is the first to send one of them to school. Thus, in this book, you pass
from wonder to wonder, through gardens of hidden treasure, where giant
streams bloom before you, and behind you, and all around, and you feel
as happy, and groggy, and satisfied with your quart of mixed metaphor
aboard as you would if it had been mixed in a sample-room and delivered
from a jug.</p>
<p>Now we come upon some more McClintockian surprise–a sweetheart who is
sprung upon us without any preparation, along with a name for her which
is even a little more of a surprise than she herself is.</p>
<p>In 1842 he entered the class, and made rapid progress in the English
and Latin departments. Indeed, he continued advancing with such rapidity
that he was like to become the first in his class, and made such
unexpected progress, and was so studious, that he had almost forgotten
the pictured saint of his affections. The fresh wreaths of the pine and
cypress had waited anxiously to drop once more the dews of Heaven upon
the heads of those who had so often poured forth the tender emotions of
their souls under its boughs. He was aware of the pleasure that he had
seen there. So one evening, as he was returning from his reading, he
concluded he would pay a visit to this enchanting spot. Little did he
think of witnessing a shadow of his former happiness, though no doubt he
wished it might be so. He continued sauntering by the roadside,
meditating on the past. The nearer he approached the spot, the more
anxious he became. At that moment a tall female figure flitted across
his path, with a bunch of roses in her hand; her countenance showed
uncommon vivacity, with a resolute spirit; her ivory teeth already
appeared as she smiled beautifully, promenading–while her ringlets of
hair dangled unconsciously around her snowy neck. Nothing was wanting to
complete her beauty. The tinge of the rose was in full bloom upon her
cheek; the charms of sensibility and tenderness were always her
associates. In Ambulinia’s bosom dwelt a noble soul–one that never faded
–one that never was conquered.</p>
<p>Ambulinia! It can hardly be matched in fiction. The full name is
Ambulinia Valeer. Marriage will presently round it out and perfect it.
Then it will be Mrs. Ambulinia Valeer Elfonzo. It takes the chromo.</p>
<p>Her heart yielded to no feeling but the love of Elfonzo, on whom she
gazed with intense delight, and to whom she felt herself more closely
bound, because he sought the hand of no other. Elfonzo was roused from
his apparent reverie. His books no longer were his inseparable
companions–his thoughts arrayed themselves to encourage him to the field
of victory. He endeavored to speak to his supposed Ambulinia, but his
speech appeared not in words. No, his effort was a stream of fire, that
kindled his soul into a flame of admiration, and carried his senses away
captive. Ambulinia had disappeared, to make him more mindful of his
duty. As she walked speedily away through the piny woods, she calmly
echoed: “O! Elfonzo, thou wilt now look from thy sunbeams. Thou shalt
now walk in a new path–perhaps thy way leads through darkness; but fear
not, the stars foretell happiness.“</p>
<p>To McClintock that jingling jumble of fine words meant something, no
doubt, or seemed to mean something; but it is useless for us to try to
divine what it was. Ambulinia comes–we don’t know whence nor why; she
mysteriously intimates–we don’t know what; and then she goes echoing
away–we don’t know whither; and down comes the curtain. McClintock’s art
is subtle; McClintock’s art is deep.</p>
<p>Not many days afterward, as surrounded by fragrant flowers she sat
one evening at twilight, to enjoy the cool breeze that whispered notes
of melody along the distant groves, the little birds perched on every
side, as if to watch the movements of their new visitor. The bells were
tolling, when Elfonzo silently stole along by the wild wood flowers,
holding in his hand his favorite instrument of music –his eye
continually searching for Ambulinia, who hardly seemed to perceive him,
as she played carelessly with the songsters that hopped from branch to
branch. Nothing could be more striking than the difference between the
two. Nature seemed to have given the more tender soul to Elfonzo, and
the stronger and more courageous to Ambulinia. A deep feeling spoke from
the eyes of Elfonzo –such a feeling as can only be expressed by those
who are blessed as admirers, and by those who are able to return the
same with sincerity of heart. He was a few years older than Ambulinia:
she had turned a little into her seventeenth. He had almost grown up in
the Cherokee country, with the same equal proportions as one of the
natives. But little intimacy had existed between them until the year
forty-one–because the youth felt that the character of such a lovely
girl was too exalted to inspire any other feeling than that of quiet
reverence. But as lovers will not always be insulted, at all times and
under all circumstances, by the frowns and cold looks of crabbed old
age, which should continually reflect dignity upon those around, and
treat the unfortunate as well as the fortunate with a graceful mien, he
continued to use diligence and perseverance. All this lighted a spark in
his heart that changed his whole character, and like the unyielding
Deity that follows the storm to check its rage in the forest, he
resolves for the first time to shake off his embarrassment and return
where he had before only worshiped.</p>
<p>At last we begin to get the Major’s measure. We are able to put this
and that casual fact together, and build the man up before our eyes, and
look at him. And after we have got him built, we find him worth the
trouble. By the above comparison between his age and Ambulinia’s, we
guess the war-worn veteran to be twenty-two; and the other facts stand
thus: he had grown up in the Cherokee country with the same equal
proportions as one of the natives –how flowing and graceful the
language, and yet how tantalizing as to meaning!–he had been turned
adrift by his father, to whom he had been “somewhat of a dutiful son“;
he wandered in distant lands; came back frequently “to the scenes of his
boyhood, almost destitute of many of the comforts of life,“ in order to
get into the presence of his father’s winter-worn locks, and spread a
humid veil of darkness around his expectations; but he was always
promptly sent back to the cold charity of the combat again; he learned
to play the fiddle, and made a name for himself in that line; he had
dwelt among the wild tribes; he had philosophized about the despoilers
of the kingdoms of the earth, and found out–the cunning creature –that
they refer their differences to the learned for settlement; he had
achieved a vast fame as a military chieftain, the Achilles of the
Florida campaigns, and then had got him a spelling-book and started to
school; he had fallen in love with Ambulinia Valeer while she was
teething, but had kept it to himself awhile, out of the reverential awe
which he felt for the child; but now at last, like the unyielding Deity
who follows the storm to check its rage in the forest, he resolves to
shake off his embarrassment, and to return where before he had only
worshiped. The Major, indeed, has made up his mind to rise up and shake
his faculties together, and to see if HE can’t do that thing himself.
This is not clear. But no matter about that: there stands the hero,
compact and visible; and he is no mean structure, considering that his
creator had never structure, considering that his creator had never
created anything before, and hadn’t anything but rags and wind to build
with this time. It seems to me that no one can contemplate this odd
creature, this quaint and curious blatherskite, without admiring
McClintock, or, at any rate, loving him and feeling grateful to him; for
McClintock made him, he gave him to us; without McClintock we could not
have had him, and would now be poor.</p>
<p>But we must come to the feast again. Here is a courtship scene, down
there in the romantic glades among the raccoons, alligators, and things,
that has merit, peculiar literary merit. See how Achilles woos. Dwell
upon the second sentence (particularly the close of it) and the
beginning of the third. Never mind the new personage, Leos, who is
intruded upon us unheralded and unexplained. That is McClintock’s way;
it is his habit; it is a part of his genius; he cannot help it; he never
interrupts the rush of his narrative to make introductions.</p>
<p>It could not escape Ambulinia’s penetrating eye that he sought an
interview with her, which she as anxiously avoided, and assumed a more
distant calmness than before, seemingly to destroy all hope. After many
efforts and struggles with his own person, with timid steps the Major
approached the damsel, with the same caution as he would have done in a
field of battle. “Lady Ambulinia,“ said he, trembling, “I have long
desired a moment like this. I dare not let it escape. I fear the
consequences; yet I hope your indulgence will at least hear my petition.
Can you not anticipate what I would say, and what I am about to express?
Will not you, like Minerva, who sprung from the brain of Jupiter,
release me from thy winding chains or cure me–“ “Say no more, Elfonzo,“
answered Ambulinia, with a serious look, raising her hand as if she
intended to swear eternal hatred against the whole world; “another lady
in my place would have perhaps answered your question in bitter
coldness. I know not the little arts of my sex. I care but little for
the vanity of those who would chide me, and am unwilling as well as
ashamed to be guilty of anything that would lead you to think ‘all is
not gold that glitters’; so be no rash in your resolution. It is better
to repent now, than to do it in a more solemn hour. Yes, I know what you
would say. I know you have a costly gift for me–the noblest that man can
make –YOUR HEART! You should not offer it to one so unworthy. Heaven,
you know, has allowed my father’s house to be made a house of solitude,
a home of silent obedience, which my parents say is more to be admired
than big names and high-sounding titles. Notwithstanding all this, let
me speak the emotions of an honest heart –allow me to say in the
fullness of my hopes that I anticipate better days. The bird may stretch
its wings toward the sun, which it can never reach; and flowers of the
field appear to ascend in the same direction, because they cannot do
otherwise; but man confides his complaints to the saints in whom he
believes; for in their abodes of light they know no more sorrow. From
your confession and indicative looks, I must be that person; if so
deceive not yourself.“</p>
<p>Elfonzo replied, “Pardon me, my dear madam, for my frankness. I have
loved you from my earliest days–everything grand and beautiful hath
borne the image of Ambulinia; while precipices on every hand surrounded
me, your GUARDIAN ANGEL stood and beckoned me away from the deep abyss.
In every trial, in every misfortune, I have met with your helping hand;
yet I never dreamed or dared to cherish thy love, till a voice impaired
with age encouraged the cause, and declared they who acquired thy favor
should win a victory. I saw how Leos worshiped thee. I felt my own
unworthiness. I began to KNOW JEALOUSLY, a strong guest–indeed, in my
bosom, –yet I could see if I gained your admiration Leos was to be my
rival. I was aware that he had the influence of your parents, and the
wealth of a deceased relative, which is too often mistaken for permanent
and regular tranquillity; yet I have determined by your permission to
beg an interest in your prayers–to ask you to animate my drooping
spirits by your smiles and your winning looks; for if you but speak I
shall be conqueror, my enemies shall stagger like Olympus shakes. And
though earth and sea may tremble, and the charioteer of the sun may
forget his dashing steed, yet I am assured that it is only to arm me
with divine weapons which will enable me to complete my long-tried
intention.“</p>
<p>“Return to yourself, Elfonzo,“ said Ambulinia, pleasantly: “a dream
of vision has disturbed your intellect; you are above the atmosphere,
dwelling in the celestial regions; nothing is there that urges or
hinders, nothing that brings discord into our present litigation. I
entreat you to condescend a little, and be a man, and forget it all.
When Homer describes the battle of the gods and noble men fighting with
giants and dragons, they represent under this image our struggles with
the delusions of our passions. You have exalted me, an unhappy girl, to
the skies; you have called me a saint, and portrayed in your imagination
an angel in human form. Let her remain such to you, let her continue to
be as you have supposed, and be assured that she will consider a share
in your esteem as her highest treasure. Think not that I would allure
you from the path in which your conscience leads you; for you know I
respect the conscience of others, as I would die for my own. Elfonzo, if
I am worthy of thy love, let such conversation never again pass between
us. Go, seek a nobler theme! we will seek it in the stream of time, as
the sun set in the Tigris.“ As she spake these words she grasped the
hand of Elfonzo, saying at the same time–“Peace and prosperity attend
you, my hero; be up and doing!“ Closing her remarks with this
expression, she walked slowly away, leaving Elfonzo astonished and
amazed. He ventured not to follow or detain her. Here he stood alone,
gazing at the stars; confounded as he was, here he stood.</p>
<p>Yes; there he stood. There seems to be no doubt about that. Nearly
half of this delirious story has now been delivered to the reader. It
seems a pity to reduce the other half to a cold synopsis. Pity! it is
more than a pity, it is a crime; for to synopsize McClintock is to
reduce a sky-flushing conflagration to dull embers, it is to reduce
barbaric splendor to ragged poverty. McClintock never wrote a line that
was not precious; he never wrote one that could be spared; he never
framed one from which a word could be removed without damage. Every
sentence that this master has produced may be likened to a perfect set
of teeth, white, uniform, beautiful. If you pull one, the charm is
gone.</p>
<p>Still, it is now necessary to begin to pull, and to keep it up; for
lack of space requires us to synopsize.</p>
<p>We left Elfonzo standing there amazed. At what, we do not know. Not
at the girl’s speech. No; we ourselves should have been amazed at it, of
course, for none of us has ever heard anything resembling it; but
Elfonzo was used to speeches made up of noise and vacancy, and could
listen to them with undaunted mind like the “topmost topaz of an ancient
tower“; he was used to making them himself; he–but let it go, it cannot
be guessed out; we shall never know what it was that astonished him. He
stood there awhile; then he said, “Alas! am I now Grief’s disappointed
son at last?“ He did not stop to examine his mind, and to try to find
out what he probably meant by that, because, for one reason, “a mixture
of ambition and greatness of soul moved upon his young heart,“ and
started him for the village. He resumed his bench in school, “and
reasonably progressed in his education.“ His heart was heavy, but he
went into society, and sought surcease of sorrow in its light
distractions. He made himself popular with his violin, “which seemed to
have a thousand chords–more symphonious than the Muses of Apollo, and
more enchanting than the ghost of the Hills.“ This is obscure, but let
it go.</p>
<p>During this interval Leos did some unencouraged courting, but at
last, “choked by his undertaking,“ he desisted.</p>
<p>Presently “Elfonzo again wends his way to the stately walls and
new-built village.“ He goes to the house of his beloved; she opens the
door herself. To my surprise–for Ambulinia’s heart had still seemed free
at the time of their last interview–love beamed from the girl’s eyes.
One sees that Elfonzo was surprised, too; for when he caught that light,
“a halloo of smothered shouts ran through every vein.“ A neat figure–a
very neat figure, indeed! Then he kissed her. “The scene was
overwhelming.“ They went into the parlor. The girl said it was safe, for
her parents were abed, and would never know. Then we have this fine
picture–flung upon the canvas with hardly an effort, as you will
notice.</p>
<p>Advancing toward him, she gave a bright display of her rosy neck, and
from her head the ambrosial locks breathed divine fragrance; her robe
hung waving to his view, while she stood like a goddess confessed before
him.</p>
<p>There is nothing of interest in the couple’s interview. Now at this
point the girl invites Elfonzo to a village show, where jealousy is the
motive of the play, for she wants to teach him a wholesome lesson, if he
is a jealous person. But this is a sham, and pretty shallow. McClintock
merely wants a pretext to drag in a plagiarism of his upon a scene or
two in “Othello.“</p>
<p>The lovers went to the play. Elfonzo was one of the fiddlers. He and
Ambulinia must not been seen together, lest trouble follow with the
girl’s malignant father; we are made to understand that clearly. So the
two sit together in the orchestra, in the midst of the musicians. This
does not seem to be good art. In the first place, the girl would be in
the way, for orchestras are always packed closely together, and there is
no room to spare for people’s girls; in the next place, one cannot
conceal a girl in an orchestra without everybody taking notice of it.
There can be no doubt, it seems to me, that this is bad art.</p>
<p>Leos is present. Of course, one of the first things that catches his
eye is the maddening spectacle of Ambulinia “leaning upon Elfonzo’s
chair.“ This poor girl does not seem to understand even the rudiments of
concealment. But she is “in her seventeenth,“ as the author phrases it,
and that is her justification.</p>
<p>Leos meditates, constructs a plan–with personal violence as a basis,
of course. It was their way down there. It is a good plain plan, without
any imagination in it. He will go out and stand at the front door, and
when these two come out he will “arrest Ambulinia from the hands of the
insolent Elfonzo,“ and thus make for himself a “more prosperous field of
immortality than ever was decreed by Omnipotence, or ever pencil drew or
artist imagined.“ But, dear me, while he is waiting there the couple
climb out at the back window and scurry home! This is romantic enough,
but there is a lack of dignity in the situation.</p>
<p>At this point McClintock puts in the whole of his curious play –which
we skip.</p>
<p>Some correspondence follows now. The bitter father and the distressed
lovers write the letters. Elopements are attempted. They are idiotically
planned, and they fail. Then we have several pages of romantic powwow
and confusion dignifying nothing. Another elopement is planned; it is to
take place on Sunday, when everybody is at church. But the “hero“ cannot
keep the secret; he tells everybody. Another author would have found
another instrument when he decided to defeat this elopement; but that is
not McClintock’s way. He uses the person that is nearest at hand.</p>
<p>The evasion failed, of course. Ambulinia, in her flight, takes refuge
in a neighbor’s house. Her father drags her home. The villagers gather,
attracted by the racket.</p>
<p>Elfonzo was moved at this sight. The people followed on to see what
was going to become of Ambulinia, while he, with downcast looks, kept at
a distance, until he saw them enter the abode of the father, thrusting
her, that was the sigh of his soul, out of his presence into a solitary
apartment, when she exclaimed, “Elfonzo! Elfonzo! oh, Elfonzo! where art
thou, with all thy heroes? haste, oh! haste, come thou to my relief.
Ride on the wings of the wind! Turn thy force loose like a tempest, and
roll on thy army like a whirlwind, over this mountain of trouble and
confusion. Oh friends! if any pity me, let your last efforts throng upon
the green hills, and come to the relief of Ambulinia, who is guilty of
nothing but innocent love.“ Elfonzo called out with a loud voice, “My
God, can I stand this! arouse up, I beseech you, and put an end to this
tyranny. Come, my brave boys,“ said he, “are you ready to go forth to
your duty?“ They stood around him. “Who,“ said he, “will call us to
arms? Where are my thunderbolts of war? Speak ye, the first who will
meet the foe! Who will go forward with me in this ocean of grievous
temptation? If there is one who desires to go, let him come and shake
hands upon the altar of devotion, and swear that he will be a hero; yes,
a Hector in a cause like this, which calls aloud for a speedy remedy.“
“Mine be the deed,“ said a young lawyer, “and mine alone; Venus alone
shall quit her station before I will forsake one jot or tittle of my
promise to you; what is death to me? what is all this warlike army, if
it is not to win a victory? I love the sleep of the lover and the
mighty; nor would I give it over till the blood of my enemies should
wreak with that of my own. But God forbid that our fame should soar on
the blood of the slumberer.“ Mr. Valeer stands at his door with the
frown of a demon upon his brow, with his dangerous weapon [3] ready to
strike the first man who should enter his door. “Who will arise and go
forward through blood and carnage to the rescue of my Ambulinia?“ said
Elfonzo. “All,“ exclaimed the multitude; and onward they went, with
their implements of battle. Others, of a more timid nature, stood among
the distant hills to see the result of the contest.</p>
<p>It will hardly be believed that after all this thunder and lightning
not a drop of rain fell; but such is the fact. Elfonzo and his gang
stood up and black-guarded Mr. Valeer with vigor all night, getting
their outlay back with interest; then in the early morning the army and
its general retired from the field, leaving the victory with their
solitary adversary and his crowbar. This is the first time this has
happened in romantic literature. The invention is original. Everything
in this book is original; there is nothing hackneyed about it anywhere.
Always, in other romances, when you find the author leading up to a
climax, you know what is going to happen. But in this book it is
different; the thing which seems inevitable and unavoidable never
happens; it is circumvented by the art of the author every time.</p>
<p>Another elopement was attempted. It failed.</p>
<p>We have now arrived at the end. But it is not exciting. McClintock
thinks it is; but it isn’t. One day Elfonzo sent Ambulinia another
note–a note proposing elopement No. 16. This time the plan is admirable;
admirable, sagacious, ingenious, imaginative, deep –oh, everything, and
perfectly easy. One wonders why it was never thought of before. This is
the scheme. Ambulinia is to leave the breakfast-table, ostensibly to
“attend to the placing of those flowers, which should have been done a
week ago“–artificial ones, of course; the others wouldn’t keep so
long–and then, instead of fixing the flowers, she is to walk out to the
grove, and go off with Elfonzo. The invention of this plan overstrained
the author that is plain, for he straightway shows failing powers. The
details of the plan are not many or elaborate. The author shall state
them himself –this good soul, whose intentions are always better than
his English:</p>
<p>“You walk carelessly toward the academy grove, where you will find me
with a lightning steed, elegantly equipped to bear you off where we
shall be joined in wedlock with the first connubial rights.“</p>
<p>Last scene of all, which the author, now much enfeebled, tries to
smarten up and make acceptable to his spectacular heart by introducing
some new properties–silver bow, golden harp, olive branch–things that
can all come good in an elopement, no doubt, yet are not to be compared
to an umbrella for real handiness and reliability in an excursion of
that kind.</p>
<p>And away she ran to the sacred grove, surrounded with glittering
pearls, that indicated her coming. Elfonzo hails her with his silver bow
and his golden harp. They meet–Ambulinia’s countenance brightens
–Elfonzo leads up the winged steed. “Mount,“ said he, “ye true-hearted,
ye fearless soul–the day is ours.“ She sprang upon the back of the young
thunderbolt, a brilliant star sparkles upon her head, with one hand she
grasps the reins, and with the other she holds an olive branch. “Lend
thy aid, ye strong winds,“ they exclaimed, “ye moon, ye sun, and all ye
fair host of heaven, witness the enemy conquered.“ “Hold,“ said Elfonzo,
“thy dashing steed.“ “Ride on,“ said Ambulinia, “the voice of thunder is
behind us.“ And onward they went, with such rapidity that they very soon
arrived at Rural Retreat, where they dismounted, and were united with
all the solemnities that usually attended such divine operations.</p>
<p>There is but one Homer, there is but one Shakespeare, there is but
one McClintock–and his immortal book is before you. Homer could not have
written this book, Shakespeare could not have written it, I could not
have done it myself. There is nothing just like it in the literature of
any country or of any epoch. It stands alone; it is monumental. It adds
G. Ragsdale McClintock’s to the sum of the republic’s imperishable
names.</p>

<h2 id="the-enemy-conquered-or-love-triumphant">THE ENEMY CONQUERED; OR,
LOVE TRIUMPHANT</h2>
<p>Sweet girl, thy smiles are full of charms,</p>
<p>Thy voice is sweeter still,</p>
<p>It fills the breast with fond alarms,</p>
<p>Echoed by every rill.</p>
<p>I begin this little work with an eulogy upon woman, who has ever been
distinguished for her perseverance, her constancy, and her devoted
attention to those upon whom she has been pleased to place her
AFFECTIONS. Many have been the themes upon which writers and public
speakers have dwelt with intense and increasing interest. Among these
delightful themes stands that of woman, the balm to all our sighs and
disappointments, and the most pre-eminent of all other topics. Here the
poet and orator have stood and gazed with wonder and with admiration;
they have dwelt upon her innocence, the ornament of all her virtues.
First viewing her external charms, such as set forth in her form and
benevolent countenance, and then passing to the deep hidden springs of
loveliness and disinterested devotion. In every clime, and in every age,
she has been the pride of her NATION. Her watchfulness is untiring; she
who guarded the sepulcher was the first to approach it, and the last to
depart from its awful yet sublime scene. Even here, in this highly
favored land, we look to her for the security of our institutions, and
for our future greatness as a nation. But, strange as it may appear,
woman’s charms and virtues are but slightly appreciated by thousands.
Those who should raise the standard of female worth, and paint her value
with her virtues, in living colors, upon the banners that are fanned by
the zephyrs of heaven, and hand them down to posterity as emblematical
of a rich inheritance, do not properly estimate them.</p>
<p>Man is not sensible, at all times, of the nature and the emotions
which bear that name; he does not understand, he will not comprehend;
his intelligence has not expanded to that degree of glory which drinks
in the vast revolution of humanity, its end, its mighty destination, and
the causes which operated, and are still operating, to produce a more
elevated station, and the objects which energize and enliven its
consummation. This he is a stranger to; he is not aware that woman is
the recipient of celestial love, and that man is dependent upon her to
perfect his character; that without her, philosophically and truly
speaking, the brightest of his intelligence is but the coldness of a
winter moon, whose beams can produce no fruit, whose solar light is not
its own, but borrowed from the great dispenser of effulgent beauty. We
have no disposition in the world to flatter the fair sex, we would raise
them above those dastardly principles which only exist in little souls,
contracted hearts, and a distracted brain. Often does she unfold herself
in all her fascinating loveliness, presenting the most captivating
charms; yet we find man frequently treats such purity of purpose with
indifference. Why does he do it? Why does he baffle that which is
inevitably the source of his better days? Is he so much of a stranger to
those excellent qualities as not to appreciate woman, as not to have
respect to her dignity? Since her art and beauty first captivated man,
she has been his delight and his comfort; she has shared alike in his
misfortunes and in his prosperity.</p>
<p>Whenever the billows of adversity and the tumultuous waves of trouble
beat high, her smiles subdue their fury. Should the tear of sorrow and
the mournful sigh of grief interrupt the peace of his mind, her voice
removes them all, and she bends from her circle to encourage him onward.
When darkness would obscure his mind, and a thick cloud of gloom would
bewilder its operations, her intelligent eye darts a ray of streaming
light into his heart. Mighty and charming is that disinterested devotion
which she is ever ready to exercise toward man, not waiting till the
last moment of his danger, but seeks to relieve him in his early
afflictions. It gushes forth from the expansive fullness of a tender and
devoted heart, where the noblest, the purest, and the most elevated and
refined feelings are matured and developed in those may kind offices
which invariably make her character.</p>
<p>In the room of sorrow and sickness, this unequaled characteristic may
always been seen, in the performance of the most charitable acts;
nothing that she can do to promote the happiness of him who she claims
to be her protector will be omitted; all is invigorated by the animating
sunbeams which awaken the heart to songs of gaiety. Leaving this point,
to notice another prominent consideration, which is generally one of
great moment and of vital importance. Invariably she is firm and steady
in all her pursuits and aims. There is required a combination of forces
and extreme opposition to drive her from her position; she takes her
stand, not to be moved by the sound of Apollo’s lyre or the curved bow
of pleasure.</p>
<p>Firm and true to what she undertakes, and that which she requires by
her own aggrandizement, and regards as being within the strict rules of
propriety, she will remain stable and unflinching to the last. A more
genuine principle is not to be found in the most determined, resolute
heart of man. For this she deserves to be held in the highest
commendation, for this she deserves the purest of all other blessings,
and for this she deserves the most laudable reward of all others. It is
a noble characteristic and is worthy of imitation of any age. And when
we look at it in one particular aspect, it is still magnified, and grows
brighter and brighter the more we reflect upon its eternal duration.
What will she not do, when her word as well as her affections and LOVE
are pledged to her lover? Everything that is dear to her on earth, all
the hospitalities of kind and loving parents, all the sincerity and
loveliness of sisters, and the benevolent devotion of brothers, who have
surrounded her with every comfort; she will forsake them all, quit the
harmony and sweet sound of the lute and the harp, and throw herself upon
the affections of some devoted admirer, in whom she fondly hopes to find
more than she has left behind, which is not often realized by many.
Truth and virtue all combined! How deserving our admiration and love! Ah
cruel would it be in man, after she has thus manifested such an unshaken
confidence in him, and said by her determination to abandon all the
endearments and blandishments of home, to act a villainous part, and
prove a traitor in the revolution of his mission, and then turn Hector
over the innocent victim whom he swore to protect, in the presence of
Heaven, recorded by the pen of an angel.</p>
<p>Striking as this train may unfold itself in her character, and as
pre-eminent as it may stand among the fair display of her other
qualities, yet there is another, which struggles into existence, and
adds an additional luster to what she already possesses. I mean that
disposition in woman which enables her, in sorrow, in grief, and in
distress, to bear all with enduring patience. This she has done, and can
and will do, amid the din of war and clash of arms. Scenes and
occurrences which, to every appearance, are calculated to rend the heart
with the profoundest emotions of trouble, do not fetter that exalted
principle imbued in her very nature. It is true, her tender and feeling
heart may often be moved (as she is thus constituted), but she is not
conquered, she has not given up to the harlequin of disappointments, her
energies have not become clouded in the last movement of misfortune, but
she is continually invigorated by the archetype of her affections. She
may bury her face in her hands, and let the tear of anguish roll, she
may promenade the delightful walks of some garden, decorated with all
the flowers of nature, or she may steal out along some gently rippling
stream, and there, as the silver waters uninterruptedly move forward,
shed her silent tears; they mingle with the waves, and take a last
farewell of their agitated home, to seek a peaceful dwelling among the
rolling floods; yet there is a voice rushing from her breast, that
proclaims VICTORY along the whole line and battlement of her affections.
That voice is the voice of patience and resignation; that voice is one
that bears everything calmly and dispassionately, amid the most
distressing scenes; when the fates are arrayed against her peace, and
apparently plotting for her destruction, still she is resigned.</p>
<p>Woman’s affections are deep, consequently her troubles may be made to
sink deep. Although you may not be able to mark the traces of her grief
and the furrowings of her anguish upon her winning countenance, yet be
assured they are nevertheless preying upon her inward person, sapping
the very foundation of that heart which alone was made for the weal and
not the woe of man. The deep recesses of the soul are fields for their
operation. But they are not destined simply to take the regions of the
heart for their dominion, they are not satisfied merely with
interrupting her better feelings; but after a while you may see the
blooming cheek beginning to droop and fade, her intelligent eye no
longer sparkles with the starry light of heaven, her vibrating pulse
long since changed its regular motion, and her palpitating bosom beats
once more for the midday of her glory. Anxiety and care ultimately throw
her into the arms of the haggard and grim monster death. But, oh, how
patient, under every pining influence! Let us view the matter in bolder
colors; see her when the dearest object of her affections recklessly
seeks every bacchanalian pleasure, contents himself with the last
rubbish of creation. With what solicitude she awaits his return! Sleep
fails to perform its office–she weeps while the nocturnal shades of the
night triumph in the stillness. Bending over some favorite book, whilst
the author throws before her mind the most beautiful imagery, she
startles at every sound. The midnight silence is broken by the solemn
announcement of the return of another morning. He is still absent; she
listens for that voice which has so often been greeted by the melodies
of her own; but, alas! stern silence is all that she receives for her
vigilance.</p>
<p>Mark her unwearied watchfulness, as the night passes away. At last,
brutalized by the accursed thing, he staggers along with rage, and,
shivering with cold, he makes his appearance. Not a murmur is heard from
her lips. On the contrary, she meets him with a smile–she caresses him
with tender arms, with all the gentleness and softness of her sex. Here,
then, is seen her disposition, beautifully arrayed. Woman, thou art more
to be admired than the spicy gales of Arabia, and more sought for than
the gold of Golconda. We believe that Woman should associate freely with
man, and we believe that it is for the preservation of her rights. She
should become acquainted with the metaphysical designs of those who
condescended to sing the siren song of flattery. This, we think, should
be according to the unwritten law of decorum, which is stamped upon
every innocent heart. The precepts of prudery are often steeped in the
guilt of contamination, which blasts the expectations of better moments.
Truth, and beautiful dreams–loveliness, and delicacy of character, with
cherished affections of the ideal woman –gentle hopes and aspirations,
are enough to uphold her in the storms of darkness, without the
transferred colorings of a stained sufferer. How often have we seen it
in our public prints, that woman occupies a false station in the world!
and some have gone so far as to say it was an unnatural one. So long has
she been regarded a weak creature, by the rabble and illiterate–they
have looked upon her as an insufficient actress on the great stage of
human life–a mere puppet, to fill up the drama of human existence–a
thoughtless, inactive being –that she has too often come to the same
conclusion herself, and has sometimes forgotten her high destination, in
the meridian of her glory. We have but little sympathy or patience for
those who treat her as a mere Rosy Melindi–who are always fishing for
pretty complements –who are satisfied by the gossamer of Romance, and
who can be allured by the verbosity of high-flown words, rich in
language, but poor and barren in sentiment. Beset, as she has been, by
the intellectual vulgar, the selfish, the designing, the cunning, the
hidden, and the artful–no wonder she has sometimes folded her wings in
despair, and forgotten her HEAVENLY mission in the delirium of
imagination; no wonder she searches out some wild desert, to find a
peaceful home. But this cannot always continue. A new era is moving
gently onward, old things are rapidly passing away; old superstitions,
old prejudices, and old notions are now bidding farewell to their old
associates and companions, and giving way to one whose wings are plumed
with the light of heaven and tinged by the dews of the morning. There is
a remnant of blessedness that clings to her in spite of all evil
influence, there is enough of the Divine Master left to accomplish the
noblest work ever achieved under the canopy of the vaulted skies; and
that time is fast approaching, when the picture of the true woman will
shine from its frame of glory, to captivate, to win back, to restore,
and to call into being once more, THE OBJECT OF HER MISSION.</p>
<p>Star of the brave! thy glory shed, O’er all the earth, thy army led–
Bold meteor of immortal birth! Why come from Heaven to dwell on
Earth?</p>
<p>Mighty and glorious are the days of youth; happy the moments of the
LOVER, mingled with smiles and tears of his devoted, and long to be
remembered are the achievements which he gains with a palpitating heart
and a trembling hand. A bright and lovely dawn, the harbinger of a fair
and prosperous day, had arisen over the beautiful little village of
Cumming, which is surrounded by the most romantic scenery in the
Cherokee country. Brightening clouds seemed to rise from the mist of the
fair Chattahoochee, to spread their beauty over the the thick forest, to
guide the hero whose bosom beats with aspirations to conquer the enemy
that would tarnish his name, and to win back the admiration of his
long-tried friend. He endeavored to make his way through Sawney’s
Mountain, where many meet to catch the gales that are continually
blowing for the refreshment of the stranger and the traveler. Surrounded
as he was by hills on every side, naked rocks dared the efforts of his
energies. Soon the sky became overcast, the sun buried itself in the
clouds, and the fair day gave place to gloomy twilight, which lay
heavily on the Indian Plains. He remembered an old Indian Castle, that
once stood at the foot of the mountain. He thought if he could make his
way to this, he would rest contented for a short time. The mountain air
breathed fragrance–a rosy tinge rested on the glassy waters that
murmured at its base. His resolution soon brought him to the remains of
the red man’s hut: he surveyed with wonder and astonishment the decayed
building, which time had buried in the dust, and thought to himself, his
happiness was not yet complete. Beside the shore of the brook sat a
young man, about eighteen or twenty, who seemed to be reading some
favorite book, and who had a remarkably noble countenance–eyes which
betrayed more than a common mind. This of course made the youth a
welcome guest, and gained him friends in whatever condition of life he
might be placed. The traveler observed that he was a well-built figure,
which showed strength and grace in every movement. He accordingly
addressed him in quite a gentlemanly manner, and inquired of him the way
to the village. After he had received the desired information, and was
about taking his leave, the youth said, “Are you not Major Elfonzo, the
great musician–the champion of a noble cause –the modern Achilles, who
gained so many victories in the Florida War?“ “I bear that name,“ said
the Major, “and those titles, trusting at the same time that the
ministers of grace will carry me triumphantly through all my laudable
undertakings, and if,“ continued the Major, “you, sir, are the
patronizer of noble deeds, I should like to make you my confidant and
learn your address.“ The youth looked somewhat amazed, bowed low, mused
for a moment, and began: “My name is Roswell. I have been recently
admitted to the bar, and can only give a faint outline of my future
success in that honorable profession; but I trust, sir, like the Eagle,
I shall look down from lofty rocks upon the dwellings of man, and shall
ever be ready to give you any assistance in my official capacity, and
whatever this muscular arm of mine can do, whenever it shall be called
from its buried GREATNESS.“ The Major grasped him by the hand, and
exclaimed: “O! thou exalted spirit of inspiration–thou flame of burning
prosperity, may the Heaven-directed blaze be the glare of thy soul, and
battle down every rampart that seems to impede your progress!“</p>
<p>The road which led to the town presented many attractions. Elfonzo
had bid farewell to the youth of deep feeling, and was not wending his
way to the dreaming spot of his fondness. The south winds whistled
through the woods, as the waters dashed against the banks, as rapid fire
in the pent furnace roars. This brought him to remember while alone,
that he quietly left behind the hospitality of a father’s house, and
gladly entered the world, with higher hopes than are often realized. But
as he journeyed onward, he was mindful of the advice of his father, who
had often looked sadly on the ground when tears of cruelly deceived hope
moistened his eye. Elfonzo had been somewhat of a dutiful son; yet fond
of the amusements of life–had been in distant lands–had enjoyed the
pleasure of the world and had frequently returned to the scenes of his
boyhood, almost destitute of many of the comforts of life. In this
condition, he would frequently say to his father, “Have I offended you,
that you look upon me as a stranger, and frown upon me with stinging
looks? Will you not favor me with the sound of your voice? If I have
trampled upon your veneration, or have spread a humid veil of darkness
around your expectations, send me back into the world where no heart
beats for me–where the foot of man has never yet trod; but give me at
least one kind word–allow me to come into the presence sometimes of thy
winter-worn locks.“ “Forbid it, Heaven, that I should be angry with
thee,“ answered the father, “my son, and yet I send thee back to the
children of the world –to the cold charity of the combat, and to a land
of victory. I read another destiny in thy countenance–I learn thy
inclinations from the flame that has already kindled in my soul a
stranger sensation. It will seek thee, my dear ELFONZO, it will find
thee–thou canst not escape that lighted torch, which shall blot out from
the remembrance of men a long train of prophecies which they have
foretold against thee. I once thought not so. Once, I was blind; but now
the path of life is plain before me, and my sight is clear; yet Elfonzo,
return to thy worldly occupation–take again in thy hand that chord of
sweet sounds–struggle with the civilized world, and with your own heart;
fly swiftly to the enchanted ground –let the night-OWL send forth its
screams from the stubborn oak –let the sea sport upon the beach, and the
stars sing together; but learn of these, Elfonzo, thy doom, and thy
hiding-place. Our most innocent as well as our most lawful DESIRES must
often be denied us, that we may learn to sacrifice them to a Higher
will.“</p>
<p>Remembering such admonitions with gratitude, Elfonzo was immediately
urged by the recollection of his father’s family to keep moving. His
steps became quicker and quicker–he hastened through the PINY woods,
dark as the forest was, and with joy he very soon reached the little
village or repose, in whose bosom rested the boldest chivalry. His close
attention to every important object–his modest questions about whatever
was new to him–his reverence for wise old age, and his ardent desire to
learn many of the fine arts, soon brought him into respectable
notice.</p>
<p>One mild winter day as he walked along the streets toward the
Academy, which stood upon a small eminence, surrounded by native growth
–some venerable in its appearance, others young and prosperous –all
seemed inviting, and seemed to be the very place for learning as well as
for genius to spend its research beneath its spreading shades. He
entered its classic walls in the usual mode of southern manners. The
principal of the Institution begged him to be seated and listen to the
recitations that were going on. He accordingly obeyed the request, and
seemed to be much pleased. After the school was dismissed, and the young
hearts regained their freedom, with the songs of the evening, laughing
at the anticipated pleasures of a happy home, while others tittered at
the actions of the past day, he addressed the teacher in a tone that
indicated a resolution –with an undaunted mind. He said he had
determined to become a student, if he could meet with his approbation.
“Sir,“ said he, “I have spent much time in the world. I have traveled
among the uncivilized inhabitants of America. I have met with friends,
and combated with foes; but none of these gratify my ambition, or decide
what is to be my destiny. I see the learned would have an influence with
the voice of the people themselves. The despoilers of the remotest
kingdoms of the earth refer their differences to this class of persons.
This the illiterate and inexperienced little dream of; and now if you
will receive me as I am, with these deficiencies–with all my misguided
opinions, I will give you my honor, sir, that I will never disgrace the
Institution, or those who have placed you in this honorable station.“
The instructor, who had met with many disappointments, knew how to feel
for a stranger who had been thus turned upon the charities of an
unfeeling community. He looked at him earnestly, and said: “Be of good
cheer–look forward, sir, to the high destination you may attain.
Remember, the more elevated the mark at which you aim, the more sure,
the more glorious, the more magnificent the prize.“ From wonder to
wonder, his encouragement led the impatient listener. A stranger nature
bloomed before him–giant streams promised him success–gardens of hidden
treasures opened to his view. All this, so vividly described, seemed to
gain a new witchery from his glowing fancy.</p>
<p>In 1842 he entered the class, and made rapid progress in the English
and Latin departments. Indeed, he continued advancing with such rapidity
that he was like to become the first in his class, and made such
unexpected progress, and was so studious, that he had almost forgotten
the pictured saint of his affections. The fresh wreaths of the pine and
cypress had waited anxiously to drop once more the dews of Heavens upon
the heads of those who had so often poured forth the tender emotions of
their souls under its boughs. He was aware of the pleasure that he had
seen there. So one evening, as he was returning from his reading, he
concluded he would pay a visit to this enchanting spot. Little did he
think of witnessing a shadow of his former happiness, though no doubt he
wished it might be so. He continued sauntering by the roadside,
meditating on the past. The nearer he approached the spot, the more
anxious he became. At the moment a tall female figure flitted across his
path, with a bunch of roses in her hand; her countenance showed uncommon
vivacity, with a resolute spirit; her ivory teeth already appeared as
she smiled beautifully, promenading–while her ringlets of hair dangled
unconsciously around her snowy neck. Nothing was wanting to complete her
beauty. The tinge of the rose was in full bloom upon her cheek; the
charms of sensibility and tenderness were always her associates.. In
Ambulinia’s bosom dwelt a noble soul–one that never faded –one that
never was conquered. Her heart yielded to no feeling but the love of
Elfonzo, on whom she gazed with intense delight, and to whom she felt
herself more closely bound, because he sought the hand of no other.
Elfonzo was roused from his apparent reverie. His books no longer were
his inseparable companions–his thoughts arrayed themselves to encourage
him in the field of victory. He endeavored to speak to his supposed
Ambulinia, but his speech appeared not in words. No, his effort was a
stream of fire, that kindled his soul into a flame of admiration, and
carried his senses away captive. Ambulinia had disappeared, to make him
more mindful of his duty. As she walked speedily away through the piny
woods she calmly echoed: “O! Elfonzo, thou wilt now look from thy
sunbeams. Thou shalt now walk in a new path –perhaps thy way leads
through darkness; but fear not, the stars foretell happiness.“</p>
<p>Not many days afterward, as surrounded by fragrant flowers she sat
one evening at twilight, to enjoy the cool breeze that whispered notes
of melody along the distant groves, the little birds perched on every
side, as if to watch the movements of their new visitor. The bells were
tolling when Elfonzo silently stole along by the wild wood flowers,
holding in his hand his favorite instrument of music –his eye
continually searching for Ambulinia, who hardly seemed to perceive him,
as she played carelessly with the songsters that hopped from branch to
branch. Nothing could be more striking than the difference between the
two. Nature seemed to have given the more tender soul to Elfonzo, and
the stronger and more courageous to Ambulinia. A deep feeling spoke from
the eyes of Elfonzo –such a feeling as can only be expressed by those
who are blessed as admirers, and by those who are able to return the
same with sincerity of heart. He was a few years older than Ambulinia:
she had turned a little into her seventeenth. He had almost grown up in
the Cherokee country, with the same equal proportions as one of the
natives. But little intimacy had existed between them until the year
forty-one–because the youth felt that the character of such a lovely
girl was too exalted to inspire any other feeling than that of quiet
reverence. But as lovers will not always be insulted, at all times and
under all circumstances, by the frowns and cold looks of crabbed old
age, which should continually reflect dignity upon those around, and
treat unfortunate as well as the fortunate with a graceful mien, he
continued to use diligence and perseverance. All this lighted a spark in
his heart that changed his whole character, and like the unyielding
Deity that follows the storm to check its rage in the forest, he
resolves for the first time to shake off his embarrassment and return
where he had before only worshiped.</p>
<p>It could not escape Ambulinia’s penetrating eye that he sought an
interview with her, which she as anxiously avoided, and assumed a more
distant calmness than before, seemingly to destroy all hope. After many
efforts and struggles with his own person, with timid steps the Major
approached the damsel, with the same caution as he would have done in a
field of battle. “Lady Ambulinia,“ said he, trembling, “I have long
desired a moment like this. I dare not let it escape. I fear the
consequences; yet I hope your indulgence will at least hear my petition.
Can you not anticipate what I would say, and what I am about to express?
Will not you, like Minerva, who sprung from the brain of Jupiter,
release me from thy winding chains or cure me–“ “Say no more, Elfonzo,“
answered Ambulinia, with a serious look, raising her hand as if she
intended to swear eternal hatred against the whole world; “another lady
in my place would have perhaps answered your question in bitter
coldness. I know not the little arts of my sex. I care but little for
the vanity of those who would chide me, and am unwilling as well as
shamed to be guilty of anything that would lead you to think ‘all is not
gold that glitters’; so be not rash in your resolution. It is better to
repent now than to do it in a more solemn hour. Yes, I know what you
would say. I know you have a costly gift for me–the noblest that man can
make –YOUR HEART! you should not offer it to one so unworthy. Heaven,
you know, has allowed my father’s house to be made a house of solitude,
a home of silent obedience, which my parents say is more to be admired
than big names and high-sounding titles. Notwithstanding all this, let
me speak the emotions of an honest heart; allow me to say in the
fullness of my hopes that I anticipate better days. The bird may stretch
its wings toward the sun, which it can never reach; and flowers of the
field appear to ascend in the same direction, because they cannot do
otherwise; but man confides his complaints to the saints in whom he
believes; for in their abodes of light they know no more sorrow. From
your confession and indicative looks, I must be that person; if so,
deceive not yourself.“</p>
<p>Elfonzo replied, “Pardon me, my dear madam, for my frankness. I have
loved you from my earliest days; everything grand and beautiful hath
borne the image of Ambulinia; while precipices on every hand surrounded
me, your GUARDIAN ANGEL stood and beckoned me away from the deep abyss.
In every trial, in every misfortune, I have met with your helping hand;
yet I never dreamed or dared to cherish thy love till a voice impaired
with age encouraged the cause, and declared they who acquired thy favor
should win a victory. I saw how Leos worshipped thee. I felt my own
unworthiness. I began to KNOW JEALOUSY–a strong guest, indeed, in my
bosom –yet I could see if I gained your admiration Leos was to be my
rival. I was aware that he had the influence of your parents, and the
wealth of a deceased relative, which is too often mistaken for permanent
and regular tranquillity; yet I have determined by your permission to
beg an interest in your prayers–to ask you to animate my dropping
spirits by your smiles and your winning looks; for if you but speak I
shall be conqueror, my enemies shall stagger like Olympus shakes. And
though earth and sea may tremble, and the charioteer of the sun may
forget his dashing steed, yet I am assured that it is only to arm me
with divine weapons which will enable me to complete my long-tried
intention.“</p>
<p>“Return to your self, Elfonzo,“ said Ambulinia, pleasantly; “a dream
of vision has disturbed your intellect; you are above the atmosphere,
dwelling in the celestial regions; nothing is there that urges or
hinders, nothing that brings discord into our present litigation. I
entreat you to condescend a little, and be a man, and forget it all.
When Homer describes the battle of the gods and noble men fighting with
giants and dragons, they represent under this image our struggles with
the delusions of our passions. You have exalted me, an unhappy girl, to
the skies; you have called me a saint, and portrayed in your imagination
an angel in human form. Let her remain such to you, let her continue to
be as you have supposed, and be assured that she will consider a share
in your esteem as her highest treasure. Think not that I would allure
you from the path in which your conscience leads you; for you know I
respect the conscience of others, as I would die for my own. Elfonzo, if
I am worthy of thy love, let such conversation never again pass between
us. Go, seek a nobler theme! we will seek it in the stream of time as
the sun set in the Tigris.“ As she spake these words she grasped the
hand of Elfonzo, saying at the same time, “Peace and prosperity attend
you, my hero: be up and doing!“ Closing her remarks with this
expression, she walked slowly away, leaving Elfonzo astonished and
amazed. He ventured not to follow or detain her. Here he stood alone,
gazing at the stars; confounded as he was, here he stood. The rippling
stream rolled on at his feet. Twilight had already begun to draw her
sable mantle over the earth, and now and then the fiery smoke would
ascend from the little town which lay spread out before him. The
citizens seemed to be full of life and good-humor; but poor Elfonzo saw
not a brilliant scene. No; his future life stood before him, stripped of
the hopes that once adorned all his sanguine desires. “Alas!“ said he,
“am I now Grief’s disappointed son at last.“ Ambulinia’s image rose
before his fancy. A mixture of ambition and greatness of soul moved upon
his young heart, and encouraged him to bear all his crosses with the
patience of a Job, notwithstanding he had to encounter with so many
obstacles. He still endeavored to prosecute his studies, and reasonable
progressed in his education. Still, he was not content; there was
something yet to be done before his happiness was complete. He would
visit his friends and acquaintances. They would invite him to social
parties, insisting that he should partake of the amusements that were
going on. This he enjoyed tolerably well. The ladies and gentlemen were
generally well pleased with the Major; as he delighted all with his
violin, which seemed to have a thousand chords –more symphonious than
the Muses of Apollo and more enchanting than the ghost of the Hills. He
passed some days in the country. During that time Leos had made many
calls upon Ambulinia, who was generally received with a great deal of
courtesy by the family. They thought him to be a young man worthy of
attention, though he had but little in his soul to attract the attention
or even win the affections of her whose graceful manners had almost made
him a slave to every bewitching look that fell from her eyes. Leos made
several attempts to tell her of his fair prospects –how much he loved
her, and how much it would add to his bliss if he could but think she
would be willing to share these blessings with him; but, choked by his
undertaking, he made himself more like an inactive drone than he did
like one who bowed at beauty’s shrine.</p>
<p>Elfonzo again wends his way to the stately walls and new-built
village. He now determines to see the end of the prophesy which had been
foretold to him. The clouds burst from his sight; he believes if he can
but see his Ambulinia, he can open to her view the bloody altars that
have been misrepresented to stigmatize his name. He knows that her
breast is transfixed with the sword of reason, and ready at all times to
detect the hidden villainy of her enemies. He resolves to see her in her
own home, with the consoling theme: “‘I can but perish if I go.’ Let the
consequences be what they may,“ said he, “if I die, it shall be
contending and struggling for my own rights.“</p>
<p>Night had almost overtaken him when he arrived in town. Colonel
Elder, a noble-hearted, high-minded, and independent man, met him at his
door as usual, and seized him by the hand. “Well, Elfonzo,“ said the
Colonel, “how does the world use you in your efforts?“ “I have no
objection to the world,“ said Elfonzo, “but the people are rather
singular in some of their opinions.“ “Aye, well,“ said the Colonel, “you
must remember that creation is made up of many mysteries; just take
things by the right handle; be always sure you know which is the smooth
side before you attempt your polish; be reconciled to your fate, be it
what it may; and never find fault with your condition, unless your
complaining will benefit it. Perseverance is a principle that should be
commendable in those who have judgment to govern it. I should never had
been so successful in my hunting excursions had I waited till the deer,
by some magic dream, had been drawn to the muzzle of the gun before I
made an attempt to fire at the game that dared my boldness in the wild
forest. The great mystery in hunting seems to be–a good marksman, a
resolute mind, a fixed determination, and my world for it, you will
never return home without sounding your horn with the breath of a new
victory. And so with every other undertaking. Be confident that your
ammunition is of the right kind–always pull your trigger with a steady
hand, and so soon as you perceive a calm, touch her off, and the spoils
are yours.“</p>
<p>This filled him with redoubled vigor, and he set out with a stronger
anxiety than ever to the home of Ambulinia. A few short steps soon
brought him to the door, half out of breath. He rapped gently.
Ambulinia, who sat in the parlor alone, suspecting Elfonzo was near,
ventured to the door, opened it, and beheld the hero, who stood in an
humble attitude, bowed gracefully, and as they caught each other’s looks
the light of peace beamed from the eyes of Ambulinia. Elfonzo caught the
expression; a halloo of smothered shouts ran through every vein, and for
the first time he dared to impress a kiss upon her cheek. The scene was
overwhelming; had the temptation been less animating, he would not have
ventured to have acted so contrary to the desired wish of his Ambulinia;
but who could have withstood the irrestistable temptation! What society
condemns the practice but a cold, heartless, uncivilized people that
know nothing of the warm attachments of refined society? Here the dead
was raised to his long-cherished hopes, and the lost was found. Here all
doubt and danger were buried in the vortex of oblivion; sectional
differences no longer disunited their opinions; like the freed bird from
the cage, sportive claps its rustling wings, wheels about to heaven in a
joyful strain, and raises its notes to the upper sky. Ambulinia insisted
upon Elfonzo to be seated, and give her a history of his unnecessary
absence; assuring him the family had retired, consequently they would
ever remain ignorant of his visit. Advancing toward him, she gave a
bright display of her rosy neck, and from her head the ambrosial locks
breathed divine fragrance; her robe hung waving to his view, while she
stood like a goddess confessed before him.</p>
<p>“It does seem to me, my dear sir,“ said Ambulinia, “that you have
been gone an age. Oh, the restless hours I have spent since I last saw
you, in yon beautiful grove. There is where I trifled with your feelings
for the express purpose of trying your attachment for me. I now find you
are devoted; but ah! I trust you live not unguarded by the powers of
Heaven. Though oft did I refuse to join my hand with thine, and as oft
did I cruelly mock thy entreaties with borrowed shapes: yes, I feared to
answer thee by terms, in words sincere and undissembled. O! could I
pursue, and you have leisure to hear the annals of my woes, the evening
star would shut Heaven’s gates upon the impending day before my tale
would be finished, and this night would find me soliciting your
forgiveness.“</p>
<p>“Dismiss thy fears and thy doubts,“ replied Elfonzo.</p>
<p>“Look, O! look: that angelic look of thine–bathe not thy visage in
tears; banish those floods that are gathering; let my confession and my
presence bring thee some relief.“ “Then, indeed, I will be cheerful,“
said Ambulinia, “and I think if we will go to the exhibition this
evening, we certainly will see something worthy of our attention. One of
the most tragical scenes is to be acted that has ever been witnessed,
and one that every jealous-hearted person should learn a lesson from. It
cannot fail to have a good effect, as it will be performed by those who
are young and vigorous, and learned as well as enticing. You are aware,
Major Elfonzo, who are to appear on the stage, and what the characters
are to represent.“ “I am acquainted with the circumstances,“ replied
Elfonzo, “and as I am to be one of the musicians upon that interesting
occasion, I should be much gratified if you would favor me with your
company during the hours of the exercises.“</p>
<p>“What strange notions are in your mind?“ inquired Ambulinia. “Now I
know you have something in view, and I desire you to tell me why it is
that you are so anxious that I should continue with you while the
exercises are going on; though if you think I can add to your happiness
and predilections, I have no particular objection to acquiesce in your
request. Oh, I think I foresee, now, what you anticipate.“ “And will you
have the goodness to tell me what you think it will be?“ inquired
Elfonzo. “By all means,“ answered Ambulinia; “a rival, sir, you would
fancy in your own mind; but let me say for you, fear not! fear not! I
will be one of the last persons to disgrace my sex by thus encouraging
every one who may feel disposed to visit me, who may honor me with their
graceful bows and their choicest compliments. It is true that young men
too often mistake civil politeness for the finer emotions of the heart,
which is tantamount to courtship; but, ah! how often are they deceived,
when they come to test the weight of sunbeams with those on whose
strength hangs the future happiness of an untried life.“</p>
<p>The people were now rushing to the Academy with impatient anxiety;
the band of music was closely followed by the students; then the parents
and guardians; nothing interrupted the glow of spirits which ran through
every bosom, tinged with the songs of a Virgil and the tide of a Homer.
Elfonzo and Ambulinia soon repaired to the scene, and fortunately for
them both the house was so crowded that they took their seats together
in the music department, which was not in view of the auditory. This
fortuitous circumstances added more the bliss of the Major than a
thousand such exhibitions would have done. He forgot that he was man;
music had lost its charms for him; whenever he attempted to carry his
part, the string of the instrument would break, the bow became stubborn,
and refused to obey the loud calls of the audience. Here, he said, was
the paradise of his home, the long-sought-for opportunity; he felt as
though he could send a million supplications to the throne of Heaven for
such an exalted privilege. Poor Leos, who was somewhere in the crowd,
looking as attentively as if he was searching for a needle in a
haystack; here is stood, wondering to himself why Ambulinia was not
there. “Where can she be? Oh! if she was only here, how I could relish
the scene! Elfonzo is certainly not in town; but what if he is? I have
got the wealth, if I have not the dignity, and I am sure that the squire
and his lady have always been particular friends of mine, and I think
with this assurance I shall be able to get upon the blind side of the
rest of the family and make the heaven-born Ambulinia the mistress of
all I possess.“ Then, again, he would drop his head, as if attempting to
solve the most difficult problem in Euclid. While he was thus
conjecturing in his own mind, a very interesting part of the exhibition
was going on, which called the attention of all present. The curtains of
the stage waved continually by the repelled forces that were given to
them, which caused Leos to behold Ambulinia leaning upon the chair of
Elfonzo. Her lofty beauty, seen by the glimmering of the chandelier,
filled his heart with rapture, he knew not how to contain himself; to go
where they were would expose him to ridicule; to continue where he was,
with such an object before him, without being allowed an explanation in
that trying hour, would be to the great injury of his mental as well as
of his physical powers; and, in the name of high heaven, what must he
do? Finally, he resolved to contain himself as well as he conveniently
could, until the scene was over, and then he would plant himself at the
door, to arrest Ambulinia from the hands of the insolent Elfonzo, and
thus make for himself a more prosperous field of immortality than ever
was decreed by Omnipotence, or ever pencil drew or artist imagined.
Accordingly he made himself sentinel, immediately after the performance
of the evening –retained his position apparently in defiance of all the
world; he waited, he gazed at every lady, his whole frame trembled; here
he stood, until everything like human shape had disappeared from the
institution, and he had done nothing; he had failed to accomplish that
which he so eagerly sought for. Poor, unfortunate creature! he had not
the eyes of an Argus, or he might have seen his Juno and Elfonzo,
assisted by his friend Sigma, make their escape from the window, and,
with the rapidity of a race-horse, hurry through the blast of the storm
to the residence of her father, without being recognized. He did not
tarry long, but assured Ambulinia the endless chain of their existence
was more closely connected than ever, since he had seen the virtuous,
innocent, imploring, and the constant Amelia murdered by the
jealous-hearted Farcillo, the accursed of the land.</p>
<p>The following is the tragical scene, which is only introduced to show
the subject-matter that enabled Elfonzo to come to such a determinate
resolution that nothing of the kind should ever dispossess him of his
true character, should he be so fortunate as to succeed in his present
undertaking.</p>
<p>Amelia was the wife of Farcillo, and a virtuous woman; Gracia, a
young lady, was her particular friend and confidant. Farcillo grew
jealous of Amelia, murders her, finds out that he was deceived, AND
STABS HIMSELF. Amelia appears alone, talking to herself.</p>
<p>A. Hail, ye solitary ruins of antiquity, ye sacred tombs and silent
walks! it is your aid I invoke; it is to you, my soul, wrapt in deep
mediating, pours forth its prayer. Here I wander upon the stage of
mortality, since the world hath turned against me. Those whom I believed
to be my friends, alas! are now my enemies, planting thorns in all my
paths, poisoning all my pleasures, and turning the past to pain. What a
lingering catalogue of sighs and tears lies just before me, crowding my
aching bosom with the fleeting dream of humanity, which must shortly
terminate. And to what purpose will all this bustle of life, these
agitations and emotions of the heart have conduced, if it leave behind
it nothing of utility, if it leave no traces of improvement? Can it be
that I am deceived in my conclusions? No, I see that I have nothing to
hope for, but everything for fear, which tends to drive me from the
walks of time.</p>
<p>Oh! in this dead night, if loud winds arise,</p>
<p>To lash the surge and bluster in the skies,</p>
<p>May the west its furious rage display,</p>
<p>Toss me with storms in the watery way.</p>
<p>(Enter Gracia.)</p>
<p>G. Oh, Amelia, is it you, the object of grief, the daughter of
opulence, of wisdom and philosophy, that thus complaineth? It cannot be
you are the child of misfortune, speaking of the monuments of former
ages, which were allotted not for the reflection of the distressed, but
for the fearless and bold.</p>
<p>A. Not the child of poverty, Gracia, or the heir of glory and peace,
but of fate. Remember, I have wealth more than wit can number; I have
had power more than kings could emcompass; yet the world seems a desert;
all nature appears an afflictive spectacle of warring passions. This
blind fatality, that capriciously sports with the rules and lives of
mortals, tells me that the mountains will never again send forth the
water of their springs to my thirst. Oh, that I might be freed and set
at liberty from wretchedness! But I fear, I fear this will never be.</p>
<p>G. Why, Amelia, this untimely grief? What has caused the sorrows that
bespeak better and happier days, to those lavish out such heaps of
misery? You are aware that your instructive lessons embellish the mind
with holy truths, by wedding its attention to none but great and noble
affections.</p>
<p>A. This, of course, is some consolation. I will ever love my own
species with feelings of a fond recollection, and while I am studying to
advance the universal philanthropy, and the spotless name of my own sex,
I will try to build my own upon the pleasing belief that I have
accelerated the advancement of one who whispers of departed
confidence.</p>
<p>And I, like some poor peasant fated to reside</p>
<p>Remote from friends, in a forest wide.</p>
<p>Oh, see what woman’s woes and human wants require,</p>
<p>Since that great day hath spread the seed of sinful fire.</p>
<p>G. Look up, thou poor disconsolate; you speak of quitting earthly
enjoyments. Unfold thy bosom to a friend, who would be willing to
sacrifice every enjoyment for the restoration of the dignity and
gentleness of mind which used to grace your walks, and which is so
natural to yourself; not only that, but your paths were strewed with
flowers of every hue and of every order.</p>
<p>With verdant green the mountains glow,</p>
<p>For thee, for thee, the lilies grow;</p>
<p>Far stretched beneath the tented hills,</p>
<p>A fairer flower the valley fills.</p>
<p>A. Oh, would to Heaven I could give you a short narrative of my
former prospects for happiness, since you have acknowledged to be an
unchangeable confidant–the richest of all other blessings. Oh, ye names
forever glorious, ye celebrated scenes, ye renowned spot of my hymeneal
moments; how replete is your chart with sublime reflections! How many
profound vows, decorated with immaculate deeds, are written upon the
surface of that precious spot of earth where I yielded up my life of
celibacy, bade youth with all its beauties a final adieu, took a last
farewell of the laurels that had accompanied me up the hill of my
juvenile career. It was then I began to descend toward the valley of
disappointment and sorrow; it was then I cast my little bark upon a
mysterious ocean of wedlock, with him who then smiled and caressed me,
but, alas! now frowns with bitterness, and has grown jealous and cold
toward me, because the ring he gave me is misplaced or lost. Oh, bear
me, ye flowers of memory, softly through the eventful history of past
times; and ye places that have witnessed the progression of man in the
circle of so many societies, and, of, aid my recollection, while I
endeavor to trace the vicissitudes of a life devoted in endeavoring to
comfort him that I claim as the object of my wishes.</p>
<p>Ah! ye mysterious men, of all the world, how few</p>
<p>Act just to Heaven and to your promise true!</p>
<p>But He who guides the stars with a watchful eye,</p>
<p>The deeds of men lay open without disguise;</p>
<p>Oh, this alone will avenge the wrongs I bear,</p>
<p>For all the oppressed are His peculiar care.</p>
<p>(F. makes a slight noise.)</p>
<p>A. Who is there–Farcillo?</p>
<p>G. Then I must gone. Heaven protect you. Oh, Amelia, farewell, be of
good cheer.</p>
<p>May you stand like Olympus’ towers,</p>
<p>Against earth and all jealous powers!</p>
<p>May you, with loud shouts ascend on high</p>
<p>Swift as an eagle in the upper sky.</p>
<p>A. Why so cold and distant tonight, Farcillo? Come, let us each other
greet, and forget all the past, and give security for the future.</p>
<p>F. Security! talk to me about giving security for the future –what an
insulting requisition! Have you said your prayers tonight, Madam
Amelia?</p>
<p>A. Farcillo, we sometimes forget our duty, particularly when we
expect to be caressed by others.</p>
<p>F. If you bethink yourself of any crime, or of any fault, that is yet
concealed from the courts of Heaven and the thrones of grace, I bid you
ask and solicit forgiveness for it now.</p>
<p>A. Oh, be kind, Farcillo, don’t treat me so. What do you mean by all
this?</p>
<p>F. Be kind, you say; you, madam, have forgot that kindness you owe to
me, and bestowed it upon another; you shall suffer for your conduct when
you make your peace with your God. I would not slay thy unprotected
spirit. I call to Heaven to be my guard and my watch –I would not kill
thy soul, in which all once seemed just, right, and perfect; but I must
be brief, woman.</p>
<p>A. What, talk you of killing? Oh, Farcillo, Farcillo, what is the
matter?</p>
<p>F. Aye, I do, without doubt; mark what I say, Amelia.</p>
<p>A. Then, O God, O Heaven, and Angels, be propitious, and have mercy
upon me.</p>
<p>F. Amen to that, madam, with all my heart, and with all my soul.</p>
<p>A. Farcillo, listen to me one moment; I hope you will not kill
me.</p>
<p>F. Kill you, aye, that I will; attest it, ye fair host of light,
record it, ye dark imps of hell!</p>
<p>A. Oh, I fear you–you are fatal when darkness covers your brow; yet I
know not why I should fear, since I never wronged you in all my life. I
stand, sir, guiltless before you.</p>
<p>F. You pretend to say you are guiltless! Think of thy sins, Amelia;
think, oh, think, hidden woman.</p>
<p>A. Wherein have I not been true to you? That death is unkind, cruel,
and unnatural, that kills for living.</p>
<p>F. Peace, and be still while I unfold to thee.</p>
<p>A. I will, Farcillo, and while I am thus silent, tell me the cause of
such cruel coldness in an hour like this.</p>
<p>F. That RING, oh, that ring I so loved, and gave thee as the ring of
my heart; the allegiance you took to be faithful, when it was presented;
the kisses and smiles with which you honored it. You became tired of the
donor, despised it as a plague, and finally gave it to Malos, the
hidden, the vile traitor.</p>
<p>A. No, upon my word and honor, I never did; I appeal to the Most High
to bear me out in this matter. Send for Malos, and ask him.</p>
<p>F. Send for Malos, aye! Malos you wish to see; I thought so. I knew
you could not keep his name concealed. Amelia, sweet Amelia, take heed,
take heed of perjury; you are on the stage of death, to suffer for YOUR
SINS.</p>
<p>A. What, not to die I hope, my Farcillo, my ever beloved.</p>
<p>F. Yes, madam, to die a traitor’s death. Shortly your spirit shall
take its exit; therefore confess freely thy sins, for to deny tends only
to make me groan under the bitter cup thou hast made for me. Thou art to
die with the name of traitor on thy brow!</p>
<p>A. Then, O Lord, have mercy upon me; give me courage, give me grace
and fortitude to stand this hour of trial.</p>
<p>F. Amen, I say, with all my heart.</p>
<p>A. And, oh, Farcillo, will you have mercy, too? I never intentionally
offended you in all my life, never LOVED Malos, never gave him cause to
think so, as the high court of Justice will acquit me before its
tribunal.</p>
<p>F. Oh, false, perjured woman, thou didst chill my blood, and makest
me a demon like thyself. I saw the ring.</p>
<p>A. He found it, then, or got it clandestinely; send for him, and let
him confess the truth; let his confession be sifted.</p>
<p>F. And you still wish to see him! I tell you, madam, he hath already
confessed, and thou knowest the darkness of thy heart.</p>
<p>A. What, my deceived Farcillo, that I gave him the ring, in which all
my affections were concentrated? Oh, surely not.</p>
<p>F. Aye, he did. Ask thy conscience, and it will speak with a voice of
thunder to thy soul.</p>
<p>A. He will not say so, he dare not, he cannot.</p>
<p>F. No, he will not say so now, because his mouth, I trust, is hushed
in death, and his body stretched to the four winds of heaven, to be torn
to pieces by carnivorous birds.</p>
<p>A. What, he is dead, and gone to the world of spirits with that
declaration in his mouth? Oh, unhappy man! Oh, insupportable hour!</p>
<p>F. Yes, and had all his sighs and looks and tears been lives, my
great revenge could have slain them all, without the least
condemnation.</p>
<p>A. Alas! he is ushered into eternity without testing the matter for
which I am abused and sentenced and condemned to die.</p>
<p>F. Cursed, infernal woman! Weepest thou for him to my face? He that
hath robbed me of my peace, my energy, the whole love of my life? Could
I call the fabled Hydra, I would have him live and perish, survive and
die, until the sun itself would grow dim with age. I would make him have
the thirst of a Tantalus, and roll the wheel of an Ixion, until the
stars of heaven should quit their brilliant stations.</p>
<p>A. Oh, invincible God, save me! Oh, unsupportable moment! Oh, heavy
hour! Banish me, Farcillo–send me where no eye can ever see me, where no
sound shall ever great my ear; but, oh, slay me not, Farcillo; vent thy
rage and thy spite upon this emaciated frame of mine, only spare my
life.</p>
<p>F. Your petitions avail nothing, cruel Amelia.</p>
<p>A. Oh, Farcillo, perpetrate the dark deed tomorrow; let me live till
then, for my past kindness to you, and it may be some kind angel will
show to you that I am not only the object of innocence, but one who
never loved another but your noble self.</p>
<p>F. Amelia, the decree has gone forth, it is to be done, and that
quickly; thou art to die, madam.</p>
<p>A. But half an hour allow me, to see my father and my only child, to
tell her the treachery and vanity of this world.</p>
<p>F. There is no alternative, there is no pause: my daughter shall not
see its deceptive mother die; your father shall not know that his
daughter fell disgraced, despised by all but her enchanting Malos.</p>
<p>A. Oh, Farcillo, put up thy threatening dagger into its scabbard; let
it rest and be still, just while I say one prayer for thee and for my
child.</p>
<p>F. It is too late, thy doom is fixed, thou hast not confessed to
Heaven or to me, my child’s protector–thou art to die. Ye powers of
earth and heaven, protect and defend me in this alone. (STABS HER WHILE
IMPLORING FOR MERCY.)</p>
<p>A. Oh, Farcillo, Farcillo, a guiltless death I die.</p>
<p>F. Die! die! die!</p>
<p>(Gracia enters running, falls on her knees weeping, and kisses
Amelia.)</p>
<p>G. Oh, Farcillo, Farcillo! oh, Farcillo!</p>
<p>F. I am here, the genius of the age, and the avenger of my
wrongs.</p>
<p>G. Oh, lady, speak once more; sweet Amelia, on, speak again. Gone,
gone–yes, forever gone! Farcillo, oh, cold-hearted Farcillo, some evil
fiend hath urged you to do this, Farcillo.</p>
<p>F. Say not so again, or you shall receive the same fate. I did the
glorious deed, madam–beware, then, how you talk.</p>
<p>G. I fear not your implements of war; I will let you know you have
not the power to do me harm. If you have a heart of triple brass, it
shall be reached and melted, and thy blood shall chill thy veins and
grow stiff in thy arteries. Here is the ring of the virtuous and
innocent murdered Amelia; I obtained it from Malos, who yet lives, in
hopes that he will survive the wound given him, and says he got it
clandestinely–declares Amelia to be the princess of truth and virtue,
invulnerable to anything like forgetting her first devotion to thee. The
world has heard of your conduct and your jealousy, and with one
universal voice declares her to be the best of all in piety; that she is
the star of this great universe, and a more virtuous woman never lived
since the wheels of time began. Oh, had you waited till tomorrow, or
until I had returned, some kind window would have been opened to her
relief. But, alas! she is gone–yes, forever gone, to try the realities
of an unknown world!</p>
<p>(Farcillo leaning over the body of Amelia.)</p>
<p>F. Malos not dead, and here is my ring! Oh, Amelia! falsely murdered!
Oh, bloody deed! Oh, wretch that I am! Oh, angels forgive me! Oh, God,
withhold thy vengeance! Oh, Amelia! if Heaven would make a thousand
worlds like this, set with diamonds, and all of one perfect chrysolite,
I would not have done this for them all, I would not have frowned and
cursed as I did. Oh, she was heavenly true, nursed in the very lap of
bright angels! Cursed slave that I am! Jealousy, oh! thou infernal
demon! Lost, lost to every sense of honor! Oh! Amelia –heaven-born
Amelia–dead, dead! Oh! oh! oh!–then let me die with thee. Farewell!
farewell! ye world that deceived me! (STABS HIMSELF.)</p>
<p>Soon after the excitement of this tragical scene was over, and the
enlisted feeling for Amelia had grown more buoyant with Elfonzo and
Ambulinia, he determined to visit his retired home, and make the
necessary improvements to enjoy a better day; consequently he conveyed
the following lines to Ambulinia:</p>
<p>Go tell the world that hope is glowing,</p>
<p>Go bid the rocks their silence break,</p>
<p>Go tell the stars that love is glowing,</p>
<p>Then bid the hero his lover take.</p>
<p>In the region where scarcely the foot of man hath ever trod, where
the woodman hath not found his way, lies a blooming grove, seen only by
the sun when he mounts his lofty throne, visited only by the light of
the stars, to whom are entrusted the guardianship of earth, before the
sun sinks to rest in his rosy bed. High cliffs of rocks surround the
romantic place, and in the small cavity of the rocky wall grows the
daffodil clear and pure; and as the wind blows along the enchanting
little mountain which surrounds the lonely spot, it nourishes the
flowers with the dew-drops of heaven. Here is the seat of Elfonzo;
darkness claims but little victory over this dominion, and in vain does
she spread out her gloomy wings. Here the waters flow perpetually, and
the trees lash their tops together to bid the welcome visitor a happy
muse. Elfonzo, during his short stay in the country, had fully persuaded
himself that it was his duty to bring this solemn matter to an issue. A
duty that he individually owed, as a gentleman, to the parents of
Ambulinia, a duty in itself involving not only his own happiness and his
own standing in society, but one that called aloud the act of the
parties to make it perfect and complete. How he should communicate his
intentions to get a favorable reply, he was at a loss to know; he knew
not whether to address Esq. Valeer in prose or in poetry, in a jocular
or an argumentative manner, or whether he should use moral suasion,
legal injunction, or seizure and take by reprisal; if it was to do the
latter, he would have no difficulty in deciding in his own mind, but his
gentlemanly honor was at stake; so he concluded to address the following
letter to the father and mother of Ambulinia, as his address in person
he knew would only aggravate the old gentleman, and perhaps his
lady.</p>
<p>Cumming, Ga., January 22, 1844</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Valeer–</p>
<p>Again I resume the pleasing task of addressing you, and once more beg
an immediate answer to my many salutations. From every circumstance that
has taken place, I feel in duty bound to comply with my obligations; to
forfeit my word would be more than I dare do; to break my pledge, and my
vows that have been witnessed, sealed, and delivered in the presence of
an unseen Deity, would be disgraceful on my part, as well as ruinous to
Ambulinia. I wish no longer to be kept in suspense about this matter. I
wish to act gentlemanly in every particular. It is true, the promises I
have made are unknown to any but Ambulinia, and I think it unnecessary
to here enumerate them, as they who promise the most generally perform
the least. Can you for a moment doubt my sincerity or my character? My
only wish is, sir, that you may calmly and dispassionately look at the
situation of the case, and if your better judgment should dictate
otherwise, my obligations may induce me to pluck the flower that you so
diametrically opposed. We have sword by the saints–by the gods of
battle, and by that faith whereby just men are made perfect–to be
united. I hope, my dear sir, you will find it convenient as well as
agreeable to give me a favorable answer, with the signature of
Mrs. Valeer, as well as yourself.</p>
<p>With very great esteem,</p>
<p>your humble servant,</p>
<p>J. I. Elfonzo.</p>
<p>The moon and stars had grown pale when Ambulinia had retired to rest.
A crowd of unpleasant thoughts passed through her bosom. Solitude dwelt
in her chamber–no sound from the neighboring world penetrated its
stillness; it appeared a temple of silence, of repose, and of mystery.
At that moment she heard a still voice calling her father. In an
instant, like the flash of lightning, a thought ran through her mind
that it must be the bearer of Elfonzo’s communication. “It is not a
dream!“ she said, “no, I cannot read dreams. Oh! I would to Heaven I was
near that glowing eloquence–that poetical language–it charms the mind in
an inexpressible manner, and warms the coldest heart.“ While consoling
herself with this strain, her father rushed into her room almost frantic
with rage, exclaiming: “Oh, Ambulinia! Ambulinia!! undutiful, ungrateful
daughter! What does this mean? Why does this letter bear such
heart-rending intelligence? Will you quit a father’s house with this
debased wretch, without a place to lay his distracted head; going up and
down the country, with every novel object that many chance to wander
through this region. He is a pretty man to make love known to his
superiors, and you, Ambulinia, have done but little credit to yourself
by honoring his visits. Oh, wretchedness! can it be that my hopes of
happiness are forever blasted! Will you not listen to a father’s
entreaties, and pay some regard to a mother’s tears. I know, and I do
pray that God will give me fortitude to bear with this sea of troubles,
and rescue my daughter, my Ambulinia, as a brand from the eternal
burning.“ “Forgive me, father, oh! forgive thy child,“ replied
Ambulinia. “My heart is ready to break, when I see you in this grieved
state of agitation. Oh! think not so meanly of me, as that I mourn for
my own danger. Father, I am only woman. Mother, I am only the templement
of thy youthful years, but will suffer courageously whatever punishment
you think proper to inflict upon me, if you will but allow me to comply
with my most sacred promises–if you will but give me my personal right
and my personal liberty. Oh, father! if your generosity will but give me
these, I ask nothing more. When Elfonzo offered me his heart, I gave him
my hand, never to forsake him, and now may the mighty God banish me
before I leave him in adversity. What a heart must I have to rejoice in
prosperity with him whose offers I have accepted, and then, when poverty
comes, haggard as it may be, for me to trifle with the oracles of
Heaven, and change with every fluctuation that may interrupt our
happiness –like the politician who runs the political gantlet for office
one day, and the next day, because the horizon is darkened a little, he
is seen running for his life, for fear he might perish in its ruins.
Where is the philosophy, where is the consistency, where is the charity,
in conduct like this? Be happy then, my beloved father, and forget me;
let the sorrow of parting break down the wall of separation and make us
equal in our feeling; let me now say how ardently I love you; let me
kiss that age-worn cheek, and should my tears bedew thy face, I will
wipe them away. Oh, I never can forget you; no, never, never!“</p>
<p>“Weep not,“ said the father, “Ambulinia. I will forbid Elfonzo my
house, and desire that you may keep retired a few days. I will let him
know that my friendship for my family is not linked together by cankered
chains; and if he ever enters upon my premises again, I will send him to
his long home.“ “Oh, father! let me entreat you to be calm upon this
occasion, and though Elfonzo may be the sport of the clouds and winds,
yet I feel assured that no fate will send him to the silent tomb until
the God of the Universe calls him hence with a triumphant voice.“</p>
<p>Here the father turned away, exclaiming: “I will answer his letter in
a very few words, and you, madam, will have the goodness to stay at home
with your mother; and remember, I am determined to protect you from the
consuming fire that looks so fair to your view.“</p>
<p>Cumming, January 22, 1844.</p>
<p>Sir–In regard to your request, I am as I ever have been, utterly
opposed to your marrying into my family; and if you have any regard for
yourself, or any gentlemanly feeling, I hope you will mention it to me
no more; but seek some other one who is not so far superior to you in
standing.</p>
<p>W. W. Valeer.</p>
<p>When Elfonzo read the above letter, he became so much depressed in
spirits that many of his friends thought it advisable to use other means
to bring about the happy union. “Strange,“ said he, “that the contents
of this diminutive letter should cause me to have such depressed
feelings; but there is a nobler theme than this. I know not why my
MILITARY TITLE is not as great as that of SQUIRE VALEER. For my life I
cannot see that my ancestors are inferior to those who are so bitterly
opposed to my marriage with Ambulinia. I know I have seen huge mountains
before me, yet, when I think that I know gentlemen will insult me upon
this delicate matter, should I become angry at fools and babblers, who
pride themselves in their impudence and ignorance? No. My equals! I know
not where to find them. My inferiors! I think it beneath me; and my
superiors! I think it presumption; therefore, if this youthful heart is
protected by any of the divine rights, I never will betray my
trust.“</p>
<p>He was aware that Ambulinia had a confidence that was, indeed, as
firm and as resolute as she was beautiful and interesting. He hastened
to the cottage of Louisa, who received him in her usual mode of
pleasantness, and informed him that Ambulinia had just that moment left.
“Is it possible?“ said Elfonzo. “Oh, murdered hours! Why did she not
remain and be the guardian of my secrets? But hasten and tell me how she
has stood this trying scene, and what are her future determinations.“
“You know,“ said Louisa, “Major Elfonzo, that you have Ambulinia’s first
love, which is of no small consequence. She came here about twilight,
and shed many precious tears in consequence of her own fate with yours.
We walked silently in yon little valley you see, where we spent a
momentary repose. She seemed to be quite as determined as ever, and
before we left that beautiful spot she offered up a prayer to Heaven for
thee.“ “I will see her then,“ replied Elfonzo, “though legions of
enemies may oppose. She is mine by foreordination –she is mine by
prophesy–she is mine by her own free will, and I will rescue her from
the hands of her oppressors. Will you not, Miss Louisa, assist me in my
capture?“</p>
<p>“I will certainly, by the aid of Divine Providence,“ answered Louisa,
“endeavor to break those slavish chains that bind the richest of prizes;
though allow me, Major, to entreat you to use no harsh means on this
important occasion; take a decided stand, and write freely to Ambulinia
upon this subject, and I will see that no intervening cause hinders its
passage to her. God alone will save a mourning people. Now is the day
and now is the hour to obey a command of such valuable worth.“ The Major
felt himself grow stronger after this short interview with Louisa. He
felt as if he could whip his weight in wildcats –he knew he was master
of his own feelings, and could now write a letter that would bring this
litigation to AN ISSUE.</p>
<p>Cumming, January 24, 1844.</p>
<p>Dear Ambulinia–</p>
<p>We have now reached the most trying moment of our lives; we are
pledged not to forsake our trust; we have waited for a favorable hour to
come, thinking your friends would settle the matter agreeably among
themselves, and finally be reconciled to our marriage; but as I have
waited in vain, and looked in vain, I have determined in my own mind to
make a proposition to you, though you may think it not in accord with
your station, or compatible with your rank; yet, “sub loc signo vinces.“
You know I cannot resume my visits, in consequence of the utter
hostility that your father has to me; therefore the consummation of our
union will have to be sought for in a more sublime sphere, at the
residence of a respectable friend of this village. You cannot have an
scruples upon this mode of proceeding, if you will but remember it
emanates from one who loves you better than his own life–who is more
than anxious to bid you welcome to a new and happy home. Your warmest
associates say come; the talented, the learned, the wise, and the
experienced say come;–all these with their friends say, come. Viewing
these, with many other inducements, I flatter myself that you will come
to the embraces of your Elfonzo; for now is the time of your acceptance
of the day of your liberation. You cannot be ignorant, Ambulinia, that
thou art the desire of my heart; its thoughts are too noble, and too
pure, to conceal themselves from you. I shall wait for your answer to
this impatiently, expecting that you will set the time to make your
departure, and to be in readiness at a moment’s warning to share the
joys of a more preferable life. This will be handed to you by Louisa,
who will take a pleasure in communicating anything to you that may
relieve your dejected spirits, and will assure you that I now stand
ready, willing, and waiting to make good my vows.</p>
<p>I am, dear Ambulinia, your</p>
<p>truly, and forever,</p>
<p>J. I. Elfonzo.</p>
<p>Louisa made it convenient to visit Mr. Valeer’s, though they did not
suspect her in the least the bearer of love epistles; consequently, she
was invited in the room to console Ambulinia, where they were left
alone. Ambulinia was seated by a small table –her head resting on her
hand–her brilliant eyes were bathed in tears. Louisa handed her the
letter of Elfonzo, when another spirit animated her features–the spirit
of renewed confidence that never fails to strengthen the female
character in an hour of grief and sorrow like this, and as she
pronounced the last accent of his name, she exclaimed, “And does he love
me yet! I never will forget your generosity, Louisa. Oh, unhappy and yet
blessed Louisa! may you never feel what I have felt–may you never know
the pangs of love. Had I never loved, I never would have been unhappy;
but I turn to Him who can save, and if His wisdom does not will my
expected union, I know He will give me strength to bear my lot. Amuse
yourself with this little book, and take it as an apology for my
silence,“ said Ambulinia, “while I attempt to answer this volume of
consolation.“ “Thank you,“ said Louisa, “you are excusable upon this
occasion; but I pray you, Ambulinia, to be expert upon this momentous
subject, that there may be nothing mistrustful upon my part.“ “I will,“
said Ambulinia, and immediately resumed her seat and addressed the
following to Elfonzo:</p>
<p>Cumming, Ga., January 28, 1844.</p>
<p>Devoted Elfonzo–</p>
<p>I hail your letter as a welcome messenger of faith, and can now say
truly and firmly that my feelings correspond with yours. Nothing shall
be wanting on my part to make my obedience your fidelity. Courage and
perseverance will accomplish success. Receive this as my oath, that
while I grasp your hand in my own imagination, we stand united before a
higher tribunal than any on earth. All the powers of my life, soul, and
body, I devote to thee. Whatever dangers may threaten me, I fear not to
encounter them. Perhaps I have determined upon my own destruction, by
leaving the house of the best of parents; be it so; I flee to you; I
share your destiny, faithful to the end. The day that I have concluded
upon for this task is SABBATH next, when the family with the citizens
are generally at church. For Heaven’s sake let not that day pass
unimproved: trust not till tomorrow, it is the cheat of life –the future
that never comes–the grave of many noble births –the cavern of ruined
enterprise: which like the lightning’s flash is born, and dies, and
perishes, ere the voice of him who sees can cry, BEHOLD! BEHOLD!! You
may trust to what I say, no power shall tempt me to betray confidence.
Suffer me to add one word more.</p>
<p>I will soothe thee, in all thy grief,</p>
<p>Beside the gloomy river;</p>
<p>And though thy love may yet be brief;</p>
<p>Mine is fixed forever.</p>
<p>Receive the deepest emotions of my heart for thy constant love, and
may the power of inspiration by thy guide, thy portion, and thy all. In
great haste,</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Ambulinia.</p>
<p>“I now take my leave of you, sweet girl,“ said Louisa, “sincerely
wishing you success on Sabbath next.“ When Ambulinia’s letter was handed
to Elfonzo, he perused it without doubting its contents. Louisa charged
him to make but few confidants; but like most young men who happened to
win the heart of a beautiful girl, he was so elated with the idea that
he felt as a commanding general on parade, who had confidence in all,
consequently gave orders to all. The appointed Sabbath, with a delicious
breeze and cloudless sky, made its appearance. The people gathered in
crowds to the church –the streets were filled with neighboring citizens,
all marching to the house of worship. It is entirely useless for me to
attempt to describe the feelings of Elfonzo and Ambulinia, who were
silently watching the movements of the multitude, apparently counting
them as then entered the house of God, looking for the last one to
darken the door. The impatience and anxiety with which they waited, and
the bliss they anticipated on the eventful day, is altogether
indescribable. Those that have been so fortunate as to embark in such a
noble enterprise know all its realities; and those who have not had this
inestimable privilege will have to taste its sweets before they can tell
to others its joys, its comforts, and its Heaven-born worth. Immediately
after Ambulinia had assisted the family off to church, she took
advantage of that opportunity to make good her promises. She left a home
of enjoyment to be wedded to one whose love had been justifiable. A few
short steps brought her to the presence of Louisa, who urged her to make
good use of her time, and not to delay a moment, but to go with her to
her brother’s house, where Elfonzo would forever make her happy. With
lively speed, and yet a graceful air, she entered the door and found
herself protected by the champion of her confidence. The necessary
arrangements were fast making to have the two lovers united –everything
was in readiness except the parson; and as they are generally very
sanctimonious on such occasions, the news got to the parents of
Ambulinia before the everlasting knot was tied, and they both came
running, with uplifted hands and injured feelings, to arrest their
daughter from an unguarded and hasty resolution. Elfonzo desired to
maintain his ground, but Ambulinia thought it best for him to leave, to
prepare for a greater contest. He accordingly obeyed, as it would have
been a vain endeavor for him to have battled against a man who was armed
with deadly weapons; and besides, he could not resist the request of
such a pure heart. Ambulinia concealed herself in the upper story of the
house, fearing the rebuke of her father; the door was locked, and no
chastisement was now expected. Esquire Valeer, whose pride was already
touched, resolved to preserve the dignity of his family. He entered the
house almost exhausted, looking wildly for Ambulinia. “Amazed and
astonished indeed I am,“ said he, “at a people who call themselves
civilized, to allow such behavior as this. Ambulinia, Ambulinia!“ he
cried, “come to the calls of your first, your best, and your only
friend. I appeal to you, sir,“ turning to the gentleman of the house,
“to know where Ambulinia has gone, or where is she?“ “Do you mean to
insult me, sir, in my own house?“ inquired the gentleman. “I will
burst,“ said Mr. V., “asunder every door in your dwelling, in search of
my daughter, if you do not speak quickly, and tell me where she is. I
care nothing about that outcast rubbish of creation, that mean,
low-lived Elfonzo, if I can but obtain Ambulinia. Are you not going to
open this door?“ said he. “By the Eternal that made Heaven and earth! I
will go about the work instantly, if this is not done!“ The confused
citizens gathered from all parts of the village, to know the cause of
this commotion. Some rushed into the house; the door that was locked
flew open, and there stood Ambulinia, weeping. “Father, be still,“ said
she, “and I will follow thee home.“ But the agitated man seized her, and
bore her off through the gazing multitude. “Father!“ she exclaimed, “I
humbly beg your pardon–I will be dutiful–I will obey thy commands. Let
the sixteen years I have lived in obedience to thee by my future
security.“ “I don’t like to be always giving credit, when the old score
is not paid up, madam,“ said the father. The mother followed almost in a
state of derangement, crying and imploring her to think beforehand, and
ask advice from experienced persons, and they would tell her it was a
rash undertaking. “Oh!“ said she, “Ambulinia, my daughter, did you know
what I have suffered –did you know how many nights I have whiled away in
agony, in pain, and in fear, you would pity the sorrows of a heartbroken
mother.“</p>
<p>“Well, mother,“ replied Ambulinia, “I know I have been disobedient; I
am aware that what I have done might have been done much better; but oh!
what shall I do with my honor? it is so dear to me; I am pledged to
Elfonzo. His high moral worth is certainly worth some attention;
moreover, my vows, I have no doubt, are recorded in the book of life,
and must I give these all up? must my fair hopes be forever blasted?
Forbid it, father; oh! forbid it, mother; forbid it, Heaven.“ “I have
seen so many beautiful skies overclouded,“ replied the mother, “so many
blossoms nipped by the frost, that I am afraid to trust you to the care
of those fair days, which may be interrupted by thundering and
tempestuous nights. You no doubt think as I did–life’s devious ways were
strewn with sweet-scented flowers, but ah! how long they have lingered
around me and took their flight in the vivid hope that laughs at the
drooping victims it has murdered.“ Elfonzo was moved at this sight. The
people followed on to see what was going to become of Ambulinia, while
he, with downcast looks, kept at a distance, until he saw them enter the
abode of the father, thrusting her, that was the sigh of his soul, out
of his presence into a solitary apartment, when she exclaimed, “Elfonzo!
Elfonzo! oh, Elfonzo! where art thou, with all thy heroes? haste, oh!
haste, come thou to my relief. Ride on the wings of the wind! Turn thy
force loose like a tempest, and roll on thy army like a whirlwind, over
this mountain of trouble and confusion. Oh, friends! if any pity me, let
your last efforts throng upon the green hills, and come to the relief of
Ambulinia, who is guilty of nothing but innocent love.“ Elfonzo called
out with a loud voice, “My God, can I stand this! arise up, I beseech
you, and put an end to this tyranny. Come, my brave boys,“ said he, “are
you ready to go forth to your duty?“ They stood around him. “Who,“ said
he, “will call us to arms? Where are my thunderbolts of war? Speak ye,
the first who will meet the foe! Who will go forward with me in this
ocean of grievous temptation? If there is one who desires to go, let him
come and shake hands upon the altar of devotion, and swear that he will
be a hero; yes, a Hector in a cause like this, which calls aloud for a
speedy remedy.“ “Mine be the deed,“ said a young lawyer, “and mine
alone; Venus alone shall quit her station before I will forsake one jot
or tittle of my promise to you; what is death to me? what is all this
warlike army, if it is not to win a victory? I love the sleep of the
lover and the mighty; nor would I give it over till the blood of my
enemies should wreak with that of my own. But God forbid that our fame
should soar on the blood of the slumberer.“ Mr. Valeer stands at his
door with the frown of a demon upon his brow, with his dangerous weapon
ready to strike the first man who should enter his door. “Who will arise
and go forward through blood and carnage to the rescue of my Ambulinia?“
said Elfonzo. “All,“ exclaimed the multitude; and onward they went, with
their implements of battle. Others, of a more timid nature, stood among
the distant hills to see the result of the contest.</p>
<p>Elfonzo took the lead of his band. Night arose in clouds; darkness
concealed the heavens; but the blazing hopes that stimulated them
gleamed in every bosom. All approached the anxious spot; they rushed to
the front of the house and, with one exclamation, demanded Ambulinia.
“Away, begone, and disturb my peace no more,“ said Mr. Valeer. “You are
a set of base, insolent, and infernal rascals. Go, the northern star
points your path through the dim twilight of the night; go, and vent
your spite upon the lonely hills; pour forth your love, you poor,
weak-minded wretch, upon your idleness and upon your guitar, and your
fiddle; they are fit subjects for your admiration, for let me assure
you, though this sword and iron lever are cankered, yet they frown in
sleep, and let one of you dare to enter my house this night and you
shall have the contents and the weight of these instruments.“ “Never yet
did base dishonor blur my name,“ said Elfonzo; “mine is a cause of
renown; here are my warriors; fear and tremble, for this night, though
hell itself should oppose, I will endeavor to avenge her whom thou hast
banished in solitude. The voice of Ambulinia shall be heard from that
dark dungeon.“ At that moment Ambulinia appeared at the window above,
and with a tremulous voice said, “Live, Elfonzo! oh! live to raise my
stone of moss! why should such language enter your heart? why should thy
voice rend the air with such agitation? I bid thee live, once more
remembering these tears of mine are shed alone for thee, in this dark
and gloomy vault, and should I perish under this load of trouble, join
the song of thrilling accents with the raven above my grave, and lay
this tattered frame beside the banks of the Chattahoochee or the stream
of Sawney’s brook; sweet will be the song of death to your Ambulinia. My
ghost shall visit you in the smiles of Paradise, and tell your high fame
to the minds of that region, which is far more preferable than this
lonely cell. My heart shall speak for thee till the latest hour; I know
faint and broken are the sounds of sorrow, yet our souls, Elfonzo, shall
hear the peaceful songs together. One bright name shall be ours on high,
if we are not permitted to be united here; bear in mind that I still
cherish my old sentiments, and the poet will mingle the names of Elfonzo
and Ambulinia in the tide of other days.“ “Fly, Elfonzo,“ said the
voices of his united band, “to the wounded heart of your beloved. All
enemies shall fall beneath thy sword. Fly through the clefts, and the
dim spark shall sleep in death.“ Elfonzo rushes forward and strikes his
shield against the door, which was barricaded, to prevent any
intercourse. His brave sons throng around him. The people pour along the
streets, both male and female, to prevent or witness the melancholy
scene.</p>
<p>“To arms, to arms!“ cried Elfonzo; “here is a victory to be won, a
prize to be gained that is more to me that the whole world beside.“ “It
cannot be done tonight,“ said Mr. Valeer. “I bear the clang of death; my
strength and armor shall prevail. My Ambulinia shall rest in this hall
until the break of another day, and if we fall, we fall together. If we
die, we die clinging to our tattered rights, and our blood alone shall
tell the mournful tale of a murdered daughter and a ruined father.“ Sure
enough, he kept watch all night, and was successful in defending his
house and family. The bright morning gleamed upon the hills, night
vanished away, the Major and his associates felt somewhat ashamed that
they had not been as fortunate as they expected to have been; however,
they still leaned upon their arms in dispersed groups; some were walking
the streets, others were talking in the Major’s behalf. Many of the
citizen suspended business, as the town presented nothing but
consternation. A novelty that might end in the destruction of some
worthy and respectable citizens. Mr. Valeer ventured in the streets,
though not without being well armed. Some of his friends congratulated
him on the decided stand he had taken, and hoped he would settle the
matter amicably with Elfonzo, without any serious injury. “Me,“ he
replied, “what, me, condescend to fellowship with a coward, and a
low-lived, lazy, undermining villain? no, gentlemen, this cannot be; I
had rather be borne off, like the bubble upon the dark blue ocean, with
Ambulinia by my side, than to have him in the ascending or descending
line of relationship. Gentlemen,“ continued he, “if Elfonzo is so much
of a distinguished character, and is so learned in the fine arts, why do
you not patronize such men? why not introduce him into your families, as
a gentleman of taste and of unequaled magnanimity? why are you so very
anxious that he should become a relative of mine? Oh, gentlemen, I fear
you yet are tainted with the curiosity of our first parents, who were
beguiled by the poisonous kiss of an old ugly serpent, and who, for one
APPLE, DAMNED all mankind. I wish to divest myself, as far as possible,
of that untutored custom. I have long since learned that the perfection
of wisdom, and the end of true philosophy, is to proportion our wants to
our possessions, our ambition to our capacities; we will then be a happy
and a virtuous people.“ Ambulinia was sent off to prepare for a long and
tedious journey. Her new acquaintances had been instructed by her father
how to treat her, and in what manner, and to keep the anticipated visit
entirely secret. Elfonzo was watching the movements of everybody; some
friends had told him of the plot that was laid to carry off Ambulinia.
At night, he rallied some two or three of his forces, and went silently
along to the stately mansion; a faint and glimmering light showed
through the windows; lightly he steps to the door; there were many
voices rallying fresh in fancy’s eye; he tapped the shutter; it was
opened instantly, and he beheld once more, seated beside several ladies,
the hope of all his toils; he rushed toward her, she rose from her seat,
rejoicing; he made one mighty grasp, when Ambulinia exclaimed, “Huzza
for Major Elfonzo! I will defend myself and you, too, with this
conquering instrument I hold in my hand; huzza, I say, I now invoke
time’s broad wing to shed around us some dewdrops of verdant
spring.“</p>
<p>But the hour had not come for this joyous reunion; her friends
struggled with Elfonzo for some time, and finally succeeded in arresting
her from his hands. He dared not injure them, because they were matrons
whose courage needed no spur; she was snatched from the arms of Elfonzo,
with so much eagerness, and yet with such expressive signification, that
he calmly withdrew from this lovely enterprise, with an ardent hope that
he should be lulled to repose by the zephyrs which whispered peace to
his soul. Several long days and night passed unmolested, all seemed to
have grounded their arms of rebellion, and no callidity appeared to be
going on with any of the parties. Other arrangements were made by
Ambulinia; she feigned herself to be entirely the votary of a mother’s
care, and she, by her graceful smiles, that manhood might claim his
stern dominion in some other region, where such boisterous love was not
so prevalent. This gave the parents a confidence that yielded some hours
of sober joy; they believed that Ambulinia would now cease to love
Elfonzo, and that her stolen affections would now expire with her
misguided opinions. They therefore declined the idea of sending her to a
distant land. But oh! they dreamed not of the rapture that dazzled the
fancy of Ambulinia, who would say, when alone, youth should not fly away
on his rosy pinions, and leave her to grapple in the conflict with
unknown admirers.</p>
<p>No frowning age shall control</p>
<p>The constant current of my soul,</p>
<p>Nor a tear from pity’s eye</p>
<p>Shall check my sympathetic sigh.</p>
<p>With this resolution fixed in her mind, one dark and dreary night,
when the winds whistled and the tempest roared, she received
intelligence that Elfonzo was then waiting, and every preparation was
then ready, at the residence of Dr. Tully, and for her to make a quick
escape while the family was reposing. Accordingly she gathered her
books, went the wardrobe supplied with a variety of ornamental dressing,
and ventured alone in the streets to make her way to Elfonzo, who was
near at hand, impatiently looking and watching her arrival. “What
forms,“ said she, “are those rising before me? What is that dark spot on
the clouds? I do wonder what frightful ghost that is, gleaming on the
red tempest? Oh, be merciful and tell me what region you are from. Oh,
tell me, ye strong spirits, or ye dark and fleeting clouds, that I yet
have a friend.“ “A friend,“ said a low, whispering voice. “I am thy
unchanging, thy aged, and thy disappointed mother. Why brandish in that
hand of thine a javelin of pointed steel? Why suffer that lip I have
kissed a thousand times to equivocate? My daughter, let these tears sink
deep into thy soul, and no longer persist in that which may be your
destruction and ruin. Come, my dear child, retract your steps, and bear
me company to your welcome home.“ Without one retorting word, or frown
from her brow, she yielded to the entreaties of her mother, and with all
the mildness of her former character she went along with the silver lamp
of age, to the home of candor and benevolence. Her father received her
cold and formal politeness–“Where has Ambulinia been, this blustering
evening, Mrs. Valeer?“ inquired he. “Oh, she and I have been taking a
solitary walk,“ said the mother; “all things, I presume, are now working
for the best.“</p>
<p>Elfonzo heard this news shortly after it happened. “What,“ said he,
“has heaven and earth turned against me? I have been disappointed times
without number. Shall I despair?–must I give it over? Heaven’s decrees
will not fade; I will write again–I will try again; and if it traverses
a gory field, I pray forgiveness at the altar of justice.“</p>
<p>Desolate Hill, Cumming, Geo., 1844.</p>
<p>Unconquered and Beloved Ambulinia– I have only time to say to you,
not to despair; thy fame shall not perish; my visions are brightening
before me. The whirlwind’s rage is past, and we now shall subdue our
enemies without doubt. On Monday morning, when your friends are at
breakfast, they will not suspect your departure, or even mistrust me
being in town, as it has been reported advantageously that I have left
for the west. You walk carelessly toward the academy grove, where you
will find me with a lightning steed, elegantly equipped to bear you off
where we shall be joined in wedlock with the first connubial rights.
Fail not to do this–think not of the tedious relations of our wrongs –be
invincible. You alone occupy all my ambition, and I alone will make you
my happy spouse, with the same unimpeached veracity. I remain, forever,
your devoted friend and admirer, J. L. Elfonzo.</p>
<p>The appointed day ushered in undisturbed by any clouds; nothing
disturbed Ambulinia’s soft beauty. With serenity and loveliness she
obeys the request of Elfonzo. The moment the family seated themselves at
the table–“Excuse my absence for a short time,“ said she, “while I
attend to the placing of those flowers, which should have been done a
week ago.“ And away she ran to the sacred grove, surrounded with
glittering pearls, that indicated her coming. Elfonzo hails her with his
silver bow and his golden harp. They meet –Ambulinia’s countenance
brightens–Elfonzo leads up his winged steed. “Mount,“ said he, “ye
true-hearted, ye fearless soul–the day is ours.“ She sprang upon the
back of the young thunder bolt, a brilliant star sparkles upon her head,
with one hand she grasps the reins, and with the other she holds an
olive branch. “Lend thy aid, ye strong winds,“ they exclaimed, “ye moon,
ye sun, and all ye fair host of heaven, witness the enemy conquered.“
“Hold,“ said Elfonzo, “thy dashing steed.“ “Ride on,“ said Ambulinia,
“the voice of thunder is behind us.“ And onward they went, with such
rapidity that they very soon arrived at Rural Retreat, where they
dismounted, and were united with all the solemnities that usually attend
such divine operations. They passed the day in thanksgiving and great
rejoicing, and on that evening they visited their uncle, where many of
their friends and acquaintances had gathered to congratulate them in the
field of untainted bliss. The kind old gentleman met them in the yard:
“Well,“ said he, “I wish I may die, Elfonzo, if you and Ambulinia
haven’t tied a knot with your tongue that you can’t untie with your
teeth. But come in, come in, never mind, all is right–the world still
moves on, and no one has fallen in this great battle.“</p>
<p>Happy now is there lot! Unmoved by misfortune, they live among the
fair beauties of the South. Heaven spreads their peace and fame upon the
arch of the rainbow, and smiles propitiously at their triumph, THROUGH
THE TEARS OF THE STORM.</p>
<h2 id="the-californians-tale">THE CALIFORNIAN’S TALE</h2>
<p>Thirty-five years ago I was out prospecting on the Stanislaus,
tramping all day long with pick and pan and horn, and washing a hatful
of dirt here and there, always expecting to make a rich strike, and
never doing it. It was a lovely region, woodsy, balmy, delicious, and
had once been populous, long years before, but now the people had
vanished and the charming paradise was a solitude. They went away when
the surface diggings gave out. In one place, where a busy little city
with banks and newspapers and fire companies and a mayor and aldermen
had been, was nothing but a wide expanse of emerald turf, with not even
the faintest sign that human life had ever been present there. This was
down toward Tuttletown. In the country neighborhood thereabouts, along
the dusty roads, one found at intervals the prettiest little cottage
homes, snug and cozy, and so cobwebbed with vines snowed thick with
roses that the doors and windows were wholly hidden from sight–sign that
these were deserted homes, forsaken years ago by defeated and
disappointed families who could neither sell them nor give them away.
Now and then, half an hour apart, one came across solitary log cabins of
the earliest mining days, built by the first gold-miners, the
predecessors of the cottage-builders. In some few cases these cabins
were still occupied; and when this was so, you could depend upon it that
the occupant was the very pioneer who had built the cabin; and you could
depend on another thing, too–that he was there because he had once had
his opportunity to go home to the States rich, and had not done it; had
rather lost his wealth, and had then in his humiliation resolved to
sever all communication with his home relatives and friends, and be to
them thenceforth as one dead. Round about California in that day were
scattered a host of these living dead men –pride-smitten poor fellows,
grizzled and old at forty, whose secret thoughts were made all of
regrets and longings–regrets for their wasted lives, and longings to be
out of the struggle and done with it all.</p>
<p>It was a lonesome land! Not a sound in all those peaceful expanses of
grass and woods but the drowsy hum of insects; no glimpse of man or
beast; nothing to keep up your spirits and make you glad to be alive.
And so, at last, in the early part of the afternoon, when I caught sight
of a human creature, I felt a most grateful uplift. This person was a
man about forty-five years old, and he was standing at the gate of one
of those cozy little rose-clad cottages of the sort already referred to.
However, this one hadn’t a deserted look; it had the look of being lived
in and petted and cared for and looked after; and so had its front yard,
which was a garden of flowers, abundant, gay, and flourishing. I was
invited in, of course, and required to make myself at home –it was the
custom of the country.</p>
<p>It was delightful to be in such a place, after long weeks of daily
and nightly familiarity with miners’ cabins–with all which this implies
of dirt floor, never-made beds, tin plates and cups, bacon and beans and
black coffee, and nothing of ornament but war pictures from the Eastern
illustrated papers tacked to the log walls. That was all hard,
cheerless, materialistic desolation, but here was a nest which had
aspects to rest the tired eye and refresh that something in one’s nature
which, after long fasting, recognizes, when confronted by the belongings
of art, howsoever cheap and modest they may be, that it has
unconsciously been famishing and now has found nourishment. I could not
have believed that a rag carpet could feast me so, and so content me; or
that there could be such solace to the soul in wall-paper and framed
lithographs, and bright-colored tidies and lamp-mats, and Windsor
chairs, and varnished what-nots, with sea-shells and books and china
vases on them, and the score of little unclassifiable tricks and touches
that a woman’s hand distributes about a home, which one sees without
knowing he sees them, yet would miss in a moment if they were taken
away. The delight that was in my heart showed in my face, and the man
saw it and was pleased; saw it so plainly that he answered it as if it
had been spoken.</p>
<p>“All her work,“ he said, caressingly; “she did it all herself –every
bit,“ and he took the room in with a glance which was full of
affectionate worship. One of those soft Japanese fabrics with which
women drape with careful negligence the upper part of a picture-frame
was out of adjustment. He noticed it, and rearranged it with cautious
pains, stepping back several times to gauge the effect before he got it
to suit him. Then he gave it a light finishing pat or two with his hand,
and said: “She always does that. You can’t tell just what it lacks, but
it does lack something until you’ve done that–you can see it yourself
after it’s done, but that is all you know; you can’t find out the law of
it. It’s like the finishing pats a mother gives the child’s hair after
she’s got it combed and brushed, I reckon. I’ve seen her fix all these
things so much that I can do them all just her way, though I don’t know
the law of any of them. But she knows the law. She knows the why and the
how both; but I don’t know the why; I only know the how.“</p>
<p>He took me into a bedroom so that I might wash my hands; such a
bedroom as I had not seen for years: white counterpane, white pillows,
carpeted floor, papered walls, pictures, dressing-table, with mirror and
pin-cushion and dainty toilet things; and in the corner a wash-stand,
with real china-ware bowl and pitcher, and with soap in a china dish,
and on a rack more than a dozen towels–towels too clean and white for
one out of practice to use without some vague sense of profanation. So
my face spoke again, and he answered with gratified words:</p>
<p>“All her work; she did it all herself–every bit. Nothing here that
hasn’t felt the touch of her hand. Now you would think –But I mustn’t
talk so much.“</p>
<p>By this time I was wiping my hands and glancing from detail to detail
of the room’s belongings, as one is apt to do when he is in a new place,
where everything he sees is a comfort to his eye and his spirit; and I
became conscious, in one of those unaccountable ways, you know, that
there was something there somewhere that the man wanted me to discover
for myself. I knew it perfectly, and I knew he was trying to help me by
furtive indications with his eye, so I tried hard to get on the right
track, being eager to gratify him. I failed several times, as I could
see out of the corner of my eye without being told; but at last I knew I
must be looking straight at the thing–knew it from the pleasure issuing
in invisible waves from him. He broke into a happy laugh, and rubbed his
hands together, and cried out:</p>
<p>“That’s it! You’ve found it. I knew you would. It’s her picture.“</p>
<p>I went to the little black-walnut bracket on the farther wall, and
did find there what I had not yet noticed–a daguerreotype-case. It
contained the sweetest girlish face, and the most beautiful, as it
seemed to me, that I had ever seen. The man drank the admiration from my
face, and was fully satisfied.</p>
<p>“Nineteen her last birthday,“ he said, as he put the picture back;
“and that was the day we were married. When you see her–ah, just wait
till you see her!“</p>
<p>“Where is she? When will she be in?“</p>
<p>“Oh, she’s away now. She’s gone to see her people. They live forty or
fifty miles from here. She’s been gone two weeks today.“</p>
<p>“When do you expect her back?“</p>
<p>“This is Wednesday. She’ll be back Saturday, in the evening –about
nine o’clock, likely.“</p>
<p>I felt a sharp sense of disappointment.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, because I’ll be gone then,“ I said, regretfully.</p>
<p>“Gone? No–why should you go? Don’t go. She’ll be disappointed.“</p>
<p>She would be disappointed–that beautiful creature! If she had said
the words herself they could hardly have blessed me more. I was feeling
a deep, strong longing to see her–a longing so supplicating, so
insistent, that it made me afraid. I said to myself: “I will go straight
away from this place, for my peace of mind’s sake.“</p>
<p>“You see, she likes to have people come and stop with us –people who
know things, and can talk–people like you. She delights in it; for she
knows–oh, she knows nearly everything herself, and can talk, oh, like a
bird–and the books she reads, why, you would be astonished. Don’t go;
it’s only a little while, you know, and she’ll be so disappointed.“</p>
<p>I heard the words, but hardly noticed them, I was so deep in my
thinkings and strugglings. He left me, but I didn’t know. Presently he
was back, with the picture case in his hand, and he held it open before
me and said:</p>
<p>“There, now, tell her to her face you could have stayed to see her,
and you wouldn’t.“</p>
<p>That second glimpse broke down my good resolution. I would stay and
take the risk. That night we smoked the tranquil pipe, and talked till
late about various things, but mainly about her; and certainly I had had
no such pleasant and restful time for many a day. The Thursday followed
and slipped comfortably away. Toward twilight a big miner from three
miles away came–one of the grizzled, stranded pioneers–and gave us warm
salutation, clothed in grave and sober speech. Then he said:</p>
<p>“I only just dropped over to ask about the little madam, and when is
she coming home. Any news from her?“</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, a letter. Would you like to hear it, Tom?“</p>
<p>“Well, I should think I would, if you don’t mind, Henry!“</p>
<p>Henry got the letter out of his wallet, and said he would skip some
of the private phrases, if we were willing; then he went on and read the
bulk of it–a loving, sedate, and altogether charming and gracious piece
of handiwork, with a postscript full of affectionate regards and
messages to Tom, and Joe, and Charley, and other close friends and
neighbors.</p>
<p>As the reader finished, he glanced at Tom, and cried out:</p>
<p>“Oho, you’re at it again! Take your hands away, and let me see your
eyes. You always do that when I read a letter from her. I will write and
tell her.“</p>
<p>“Oh no, you mustn’t, Henry. I’m getting old, you know, and any little
disappointment makes me want to cry. I thought she’d be here herself,
and now you’ve got only a letter.“</p>
<p>“Well, now, what put that in your head? I thought everybody knew she
wasn’t coming till Saturday.“</p>
<p>“Saturday! Why, come to think, I did know it. I wonder what’s the
matter with me lately? Certainly I knew it. Ain’t we all getting ready
for her? Well, I must be going now. But I’ll be on hand when she comes,
old man!“</p>
<p>Late Friday afternoon another gray veteran tramped over from his
cabin a mile or so away, and said the boys wanted to have a little
gaiety and a good time Saturday night, if Henry thought she wouldn’t be
too tired after her journey to be kept up.</p>
<p>“Tired? She tired! Oh, hear the man! Joe, YOU know she’d sit up six
weeks to please any one of you!“</p>
<p>When Joe heard that there was a letter, he asked to have it read, and
the loving messages in it for him broke the old fellow all up; but he
said he was such an old wreck that THAT would happen to him if she only
just mentioned his name. “Lord, we miss her so!“ he said.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon I found I was taking out my watch pretty often.
Henry noticed it, and said, with a startled look:</p>
<p>“You don’t think she ought to be here soon, do you?“</p>
<p>I felt caught, and a little embarrassed; but I laughed, and said it
was a habit of mine when I was in a state of expenctancy. But he didn’t
seem quite satisfied; and from that time on he began to show uneasiness.
Four times he walked me up the road to a point whence we could see a
long distance; and there he would stand, shading his eyes with his hand,
and looking. Several times he said:</p>
<p>“I’m getting worried, I’m getting right down worried. I know she’s
not due till about nine o’clock, and yet something seems to be trying to
warn me that something’s happened. You don’t think anything has
happened, do you?“</p>
<p>I began to get pretty thoroughly ashamed of him for his childishness;
and at last, when he repeated that imploring question still another
time, I lost my patience for the moment, and spoke pretty brutally to
him. It seemed to shrivel him up and cow him; and he looked so wounded
and so humble after that, that I detested myself for having done the
cruel and unnecessary thing. And so I was glad when Charley, another
veteran, arrived toward the edge of the evening, and nestled up to Henry
to hear the letter read, and talked over the preparations for the
welcome. Charley fetched out one hearty speech after another, and did
his best to drive away his friend’s bodings and apprehensions.</p>
<p>“Anything HAPPENED to her? Henry, that’s pure nonsense. There isn’t
anything going to happen to her; just make your mind easy as to that.
What did the letter say? Said she was well, didn’t it? And said she’d be
here by nine o’clock, didn’t it? Did you ever know her to fail of her
word? Why, you know you never did. Well, then, don’t you fret; she’ll BE
here, and that’s absolutely certain, and as sure as you are born. Come,
now, let’s get to decorating –not much time left.“</p>
<p>Pretty soon Tom and Joe arrived, and then all hands set about adoring
the house with flowers. Toward nine the three miners said that as they
had brought their instruments they might as well tune up, for the boys
and girls would soon be arriving now, and hungry for a good,
old-fashioned break-down. A fiddle, a banjo, and a clarinet –these were
the instruments. The trio took their places side by side, and began to
play some rattling dance-music, and beat time with their big boots.</p>
<p>It was getting very close to nine. Henry was standing in the door
with his eyes directed up the road, his body swaying to the torture of
his mental distress. He had been made to drink his wife’s health and
safety several times, and now Tom shouted:</p>
<p>“All hands stand by! One more drink, and she’s here!“</p>
<p>Joe brought the glasses on a waiter, and served the party. I reached
for one of the two remaining glasses, but Joe growled under his
breath:</p>
<p>“Drop that! Take the other.“</p>
<p>Which I did. Henry was served last. He had hardly swallowed his drink
when the clock began to strike. He listened till it finished, his face
growing pale and paler; then he said:</p>
<p>“Boys, I’m sick with fear. Help me–I want to lie down!“</p>
<p>They helped him to the sofa. He began to nestle and drowse, but
presently spoke like one talking in his sleep, and said: “Did I hear
horses’ feet? Have they come?“</p>
<p>One of the veterans answered, close to his ear: “It was Jimmy Parish
come to say the party got delayed, but they’re right up the road a
piece, and coming along. Her horse is lame, but she’ll be here in half
an hour.“</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m SO thankful nothing has happened!“</p>
<p>He was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth. In a
moment those handy men had his clothes off, and had tucked him into his
bed in the chamber where I had washed my hands. They closed the door and
came back. Then they seemed preparing to leave; but I said: “Please
don’t go, gentlemen. She won’t know me; I am a stranger.“</p>
<p>They glanced at each other. Then Joe said:</p>
<p>“She? Poor thing, she’s been dead nineteen years!“</p>
<p>“Dead?“</p>
<p>“That or worse. She went to see her folks half a year after she was
married, and on her way back, on a Saturday evening, the Indians
captured her within five miles of this place, and she’s never been heard
of since.“</p>
<p>“And he lost his mind in consequence?“</p>
<p>“Never has been sane an hour since. But he only gets bad when that
time of year comes round. Then we begin to drop in here, three days
before she’s due, to encourage him up, and ask if he’s heard from her,
and Saturday we all come and fix up the house with flowers, and get
everything ready for a dance. We’ve done it every year for nineteen
years. The first Saturday there was twenty-seven of us, without counting
the girls; there’s only three of us now, and the girls are gone. We drug
him to sleep, or he would go wild; then he’s all right for another
year–thinks she’s with him till the last three or four days come round;
then he begins to look for her, and gets out his poor old letter, and we
come and ask him to read it to us. Lord, she was a darling!“</p>
<h2 id="a-helpless-situation">A HELPLESS SITUATION</h2>
<p>Once or twice a year I get a letter of a certain pattern, a pattern
that never materially changes, in form and substance, yet I cannot get
used to that letter–it always astonishes me. It affects me as the
locomotive always affects me: I saw to myself, “I have seen you a
thousand times, you always look the same way, yet you are always a
wonder, and you are always impossible; to contrive you is clearly beyond
human genius–you can’t exist, you don’t exist, yet here you are!“</p>
<p>I have a letter of that kind by me, a very old one. I yearn to print
it, and where is the harm? The writer of it is dead years ago, no doubt,
and if I conceal her name and address–her this-world address –I am sure
her shade will not mind. And with it I wish to print the answer which I
wrote at the time but probably did not send. If it went–which is not
likely–it went in the form of a copy, for I find the original still
here, pigeonholed with the said letter. To that kind of letters we all
write answers which we do not send, fearing to hurt where we have no
desire to hurt; I have done it many a time, and this is doubtless a case
of the sort.</p>
<p>THE LETTER</p>
<p>X——, California, JUNE 3, 1879.</p>
<p>Mr. S. L. Clemens, HARTFORD, CONN.:</p>
<p>Dear Sir,–You will doubtless be surprised to know who has presumed to
write and ask a favor of you. Let your memory go back to your days in
the Humboldt mines–’62-’63. You will remember, you and Clagett and
Oliver and the old blacksmith Tillou lived in a lean-to which was
half-way up the gulch, and there were six log cabins in the camp –strung
pretty well separated up the gulch from its mouth at the desert to where
the last claim was, at the divide. The lean-to you lived in was the one
with a canvas roof that the cow fell down through one night, as told
about by you in ROUGHING IT–my uncle Simmons remembers it very well. He
lived in the principal cabin, half-way up the divide, along with Dixon
and Parker and Smith. It had two rooms, one for kitchen and the other
for bunks, and was the only one that had. You and your party were there
on the great night, the time they had dried-apple-pie, Uncle Simmons
often speaks of it. It seems curious that dried-apple-pie should have
seemed such a great thing, but it was, and it shows how far Humboldt was
out of the world and difficult to get to, and how slim the regular bill
of fare was. Sixteen years ago–it is a long time. I was a little girl
then, only fourteen. I never saw you, I lived in Washoe. But Uncle
Simmons ran across you every now and then, all during those weeks that
you and party were there working your claim which was like the rest. The
camp played out long and long ago, there wasn’t silver enough in it to
make a button. You never saw my husband, but he was there after you
left, AND LIVED IN THAT VERY LEAN-TO, a bachelor then but married to me
now. He often wishes there had been a photographer there in those days,
he would have taken the lean-to. He got hurt in the old Hal Clayton
claim that was abandoned like the others, putting in a blast and not
climbing out quick enough, though he scrambled the best he could. It
landed him clear down on the train and hit a Piute. For weeks they
thought he would not get over it but he did, and is all right, now. Has
been ever since. This is a long introduction but it is the only way I
can make myself known. The favor I ask I feel assured your generous
heart will grant: Give me some advice about a book I have written. I do
not claim anything for it only it is mostly true and as interesting as
most of the books of the times. I am unknown in the literary world and
you know what that means unless one has some one of influence (like
yourself) to help you by speaking a good word for you. I would like to
place the book on royalty basis plan with any one you would suggest.</p>
<p>This is a secret from my husband and family. I intend it as a
surprise in case I get it published.</p>
<p>Feeling you will take an interest in this and if possible write me a
letter to some publisher, or, better still, if you could see them for me
and then let me hear.</p>
<p>I appeal to you to grant me this favor. With deepest gratitude I
think you for your attention.</p>
<p>One knows, without inquiring, that the twin of that embarrassing
letter is forever and ever flying in this and that and the other
direction across the continent in the mails, daily, nightly, hourly,
unceasingly, unrestingly. It goes to every well-known merchant, and
railway official, and manufacturer, and capitalist, and Mayor, and
Congressman, and Governor, and editor, and publisher, and author, and
broker, and banker–in a word, to every person who is supposed to have
“influence.“ It always follows the one pattern: “You do not know me, BUT
YOU ONCE KNEW A RELATIVE OF MINE,“ etc., etc. We should all like to help
the applicants, we should all be glad to do it, we should all like to
return the sort of answer that is desired, but–Well, there is not a
thing we can do that would be a help, for not in any instance does that
latter ever come from anyone who CAN be helped. The struggler whom you
COULD help does his own helping; it would not occur to him to apply to
you, stranger. He has talent and knows it, and he goes into his fight
eagerly and with energy and determination–all alone, preferring to be
alone. That pathetic letter which comes to you from the incapable, the
unhelpable–how do you who are familiar with it answer it? What do you
find to say? You do not want to inflict a wound; you hunt ways to avoid
that. What do you find? How do you get out of your hard place with a
contend conscience? Do you try to explain? The old reply of mine to such
a letter shows that I tried that once. Was I satisfied with the result?
Possibly; and possibly not; probably not; almost certainly not. I have
long ago forgotten all about it. But, anyway, I append my effort:</p>
<p>THE REPLY</p>
<p>I know Mr. H., and I will go to him, dear madam, if upon reflection
you find you still desire it. There will be a conversation. I know the
form it will take. It will be like this:</p>
<p>MR. H. How do her books strike you?</p>
<p>MR. CLEMENS. I am not acquainted with them.</p>
<p>H. Who has been her publisher?</p>
<p>C. I don’t know.</p>
<p>H. She HAS one, I suppose?</p>
<p>C. I–I think not.</p>
<p>H. Ah. You think this is her first book?</p>
<p>C. Yes–I suppose so. I think so.</p>
<p>H. What is it about? What is the character of it?</p>
<p>C. I believe I do not know.</p>
<p>H. Have you seen it?</p>
<p>C. Well–no, I haven’t.</p>
<p>H. Ah-h. How long have you known her?</p>
<p>C. I don’t know her.</p>
<p>H. Don’t know her?</p>
<p>C. No.</p>
<p>H. Ah-h. How did you come to be interested in her book, then?</p>
<p>C. Well, she–she wrote and asked me to find a publisher for her, and
mentioned you.</p>
<p>H. Why should she apply to you instead of me?</p>
<p>C. She wished me to use my influence.</p>
<p>H. Dear me, what has INFLUENCE to do with such a matter?</p>
<p>C. Well, I think she thought you would be more likely to examine her
book if you were influenced.</p>
<p>H. Why, what we are here FOR is to examine books–anybody’s book that
comes along. It’s our BUSINESS. Why should we turn away a book
unexamined because it’s a stranger’s? It would be foolish. No publisher
does it. On what ground did she request your influence, since you do not
know her? She must have thought you knew her literature and could speak
for it. Is that it?</p>
<p>C. No; she knew I didn’t.</p>
<p>H. Well, what then? She had a reason of SOME sort for believing you
competent to recommend her literature, and also under obligations to do
it?</p>
<p>C. Yes, I–I knew her uncle.</p>
<p>H. Knew her UNCLE?</p>
<p>C. Yes.</p>
<p>H. Upon my word! So, you knew her uncle; her uncle knows her
literature; he endorses it to you; the chain is complete, nothing
further needed; you are satisfied, and therefore–</p>
<p>C. NO, that isn’t all, there are other ties. I know the cabin her
uncle lived in, in the mines; I knew his partners, too; also I came near
knowing her husband before she married him, and I DID know the abandoned
shaft where a premature blast went off and he went flying through the
air and clear down to the trail and hit an Indian in the back with
almost fatal consequences.</p>
<p>H. To HIM, or to the Indian?</p>
<p>C. She didn’t say which it was.</p>
<p>H. (WITH A SIGH). It certainly beats the band! You don’t know HER,
you don’t know her literature, you don’t know who got hurt when the
blast went off, you don’t know a single thing for us to build an
estimate of her book upon, so far as I–</p>
<p>C. I knew her uncle. You are forgetting her uncle.</p>
<p>H. Oh, what use is HE? Did you know him long? How long was it?</p>
<p>C. Well, I don’t know that I really knew him, but I must have met
him, anyway. I think it was that way; you can’t tell about these things,
you know, except when they are recent.</p>
<p>H. Recent? When was all this?</p>
<p>C. Sixteen years ago.</p>
<p>H. What a basis to judge a book upon! As first you said you knew him,
and now you don’t know whether you did or not.</p>
<p>C. Oh yes, I know him; anyway, I think I thought I did; I’m perfectly
certain of it.</p>
<p>H. What makes you think you thought you knew him?</p>
<p>C. Why, she says I did, herself.</p>
<p>H. SHE says so!</p>
<p>C. Yes, she does, and I DID know him, too, though I don’t remember it
now.</p>
<p>H. Come–how can you know it when you don’t remember it.</p>
<p>C. <em>I</em> don’t know. That is, I don’t know the process, but I DO
know lots of things that I don’t remember, and remember lots of things
that I don’t know. It’s so with every educated person.</p>
<p>H. (AFTER A PAUSE). Is your time valuable?</p>
<p>C. No–well, not very.</p>
<p>H. Mine is.</p>
<p>So I came away then, because he was looking tired. Overwork, I
reckon; I never do that; I have seen the evil effects of it. My mother
was always afraid I would overwork myself, but I never did.</p>
<p>Dear madam, you see how it would happen if I went there. He would ask
me those questions, and I would try to answer them to suit him, and he
would hunt me here and there and yonder and get me embarrassed more and
more all the time, and at last he would look tired on account of
overwork, and there it would end and nothing done. I wish I could be
useful to you, but, you see, they do not care for uncles or any of those
things; it doesn’t move them, it doesn’t have the least effect, they
don’t care for anything but the literature itself, and they as good as
despise influence. But they do care for books, and are eager to get them
and examine them, no matter whence they come, nor from whose pen. If you
will send yours to a publisher–any publisher–he will certainly examine
it, I can assure you of that.</p>
<h2 id="a-telephonic-conversation">A TELEPHONIC CONVERSATION</h2>
<p>Consider that a conversation by telephone–when you are simply siting
by and not taking any part in that conversation–is one of the solemnest
curiosities of modern life. Yesterday I was writing a deep article on a
sublime philosophical subject while such a conversation was going on in
the room. I notice that one can always write best when somebody is
talking through a telephone close by. Well, the thing began in this way.
A member of our household came in and asked me to have our house put
into communication with Mr. Bagley’s downtown. I have observed, in many
cities, that the sex always shrink from calling up the central office
themselves. I don’t know why, but they do. So I touched the bell, and
this talk ensued:</p>
<p>CENTRAL OFFICE. (GRUFFY.) Hello!</p>
<p>I. Is it the Central Office?</p>
<p>C. O. Of course it is. What do you want?</p>
<p>I. Will you switch me on to the Bagleys, please?</p>
<p>C. O. All right. Just keep your ear to the telephone.</p>
<p>Then I heard K-LOOK, K-LOOK, K’LOOK–KLOOK-KLOOK-KLOOK-LOOK-LOOK! then
a horrible “gritting“ of teeth, and finally a piping female voice:
Y-e-s? (RISING INFLECTION.) Did you wish to speak to me?</p>
<p>Without answering, I handed the telephone to the applicant, and sat
down. Then followed that queerest of all the queer things in this world
–a conversation with only one end of it. You hear questions asked; you
don’t hear the answer. You hear invitations given; you hear no thanks in
return. You have listening pauses of dead silence, followed by
apparently irrelevant and unjustifiable exclamations of glad surprise or
sorrow or dismay. You can’t make head or tail of the talk, because you
never hear anything that the person at the other end of the wire says.
Well, I heard the following remarkable series of observations, all from
the one tongue, and all shouted –for you can’t ever persuade the sex to
speak gently into a telephone:</p>
<p>Yes? Why, how did THAT happen?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>What did you say?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Oh no, I don’t think it was.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>NO! Oh no, I didn’t mean THAT. I meant, put it in while it is still
boiling–or just before it COMES to a boil.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>WHAT?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>I turned it over with a backstitch on the selvage edge.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Yes, I like that way, too; but I think it’s better to baste it on
with Valenciennes or bombazine, or something of that sort. It gives it
such an air–and attracts so much noise.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>It’s forty-ninth Deuteronomy, sixty-forth to ninety-seventh
inclusive. I think we ought all to read it often.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Perhaps so; I generally use a hair pin.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>What did you say? (ASIDE.) Children, do be quiet!</p>
<p>Pause</p>
<p>OH! B FLAT! Dear me, I thought you said it was the cat!</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Since WHEN?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Why, <em>I</em> never heard of it.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>You astound me! It seems utterly impossible!</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>WHO did?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Good-ness gracious!</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Well, what IS this world coming to? Was it right in CHURCH?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>And was her MOTHER there?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Why, Mrs. Bagley, I should have died of humiliation! What did they
DO?</p>
<p>Long pause.</p>
<p>I can’t be perfectly sure, because I haven’t the notes by me; but I
think it goes something like this: te-rolly-loll-loll, loll
lolly-loll-loll, O tolly-loll-loll-LEE-LY-LI-I-do! And then REPEAT, you
know.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Yes, I think it IS very sweet–and very solemn and impressive, if you
get the andantino and the pianissimo right.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Oh, gum-drops, gum-drops! But I never allow them to eat striped
candy. And of course they CAN’T, till they get their teeth, anyway.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>WHAT?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Oh, not in the least–go right on. He’s here writing–it doesn’t bother
HIM.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Very well, I’ll come if I can. (ASIDE.) Dear me, how it does tire a
person’s arm to hold this thing up so long! I wish she’d–</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Oh no, not at all; I LIKE to talk–but I’m afraid I’m keeping you from
your affairs.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Visitors?</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>No, we never use butter on them.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Yes, that is a very good way; but all the cook-books say they are
very unhealthy when they are out of season. And HE doesn’t like them,
anyway–especially canned.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Oh, I think that is too high for them; we have never paid over fifty
cents a bunch.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>MUST you go? Well, GOOD-by.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Yes, I think so. GOOD-by.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Four o’clock, then–I’ll be ready. GOOD-by.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Thank you ever so much. GOOD-by.</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>Oh, not at all!–just as fresh–WHICH? Oh, I’m glad to hear you say
that. GOOD-by.</p>
<p>(Hangs up the telephone and says, “Oh, it DOES tire a person’s arm
so!“)</p>
<p>A man delivers a single brutal “Good-by,“ and that is the end of it.
Not so with the gentle sex–I say it in their praise; they cannot abide
abruptness.</p>
<h2 id="edward-mills-and-george-benton-a-tale">EDWARD MILLS AND GEORGE
BENTON: A TALE</h2>
<p>These two were distantly related to each other–seventh cousins, or
something of that sort. While still babies they became orphans, and were
adopted by the Brants, a childless couple, who quickly grew very fond of
them. The Brants were always saying: “Be pure, honest, sober,
industrious, and considerate of others, and success in life is assured.“
The children heard this repeated some thousands of times before they
understood it; they could repeat it themselves long before they could
say the Lord’s Prayer; it was painted over the nursery door, and was
about the first thing they learned to read. It was destined to be the
unswerving rule of Edward Mills’s life. Sometimes the Brants changed the
wording a little, and said: “Be pure, honest, sober, industrious,
considerate, and you will never lack friends.“</p>
<p>Baby Mills was a comfort to everybody about him. When he wanted candy
and could not have it, he listened to reason, and contented himself
without it. When Baby Benton wanted candy, he cried for it until he got
it. Baby Mills took care of his toys; Baby Benton always destroyed his
in a very brief time, and then made himself so insistently disagreeable
that, in order to have peace in the house, little Edward was persuaded
to yield up his play-things to him.</p>
<p>When the children were a little older, Georgie became a heavy expense
in one respect: he took no care of his clothes; consequently, he shone
frequently in new ones, with was not the case with Eddie. The boys grew
apace. Eddie was an increasing comfort, Georgie an increasing
solicitude. It was always sufficient to say, in answer to Eddie’s
petitions, “I would rather you would not do it“ –meaning swimming,
skating, picnicking, berrying, circusing, and all sorts of things which
boys delight in. But NO answer was sufficient for Georgie; he had to be
humored in his desires, or he would carry them with a high hand.
Naturally, no boy got more swimming skating, berrying, and so forth than
he; no body ever had a better time. The good Brants did not allow the
boys to play out after nine in summer evenings; they were sent to bed at
that hour; Eddie honorably remained, but Georgie usually slipped out of
the window toward ten, and enjoyed himself until midnight. It seemed
impossible to break Georgie of this bad habit, but the Brants managed it
at last by hiring him, with apples and marbles, to stay in. The good
Brants gave all their time and attention to vain endeavors to regulate
Georgie; they said, with grateful tears in their eyes, that Eddie needed
no efforts of theirs, he was so good, so considerate, and in all ways so
perfect.</p>
<p>By and by the boys were big enough to work, so they were apprenticed
to a trade: Edward went voluntarily; George was coaxed and bribed.
Edward worked hard and faithfully, and ceased to be an expense to the
good Brants; they praised him, so did his master; but George ran away,
and it cost Mr. Brant both money and trouble to hunt him up and get him
back. By and by he ran away again–more money and more trouble. He ran
away a third time–and stole a few things to carry with him. Trouble and
expense for Mr. Brant once more; and, besides, it was with the greatest
difficulty that he succeeded in persuading the master to let the youth
go unprosecuted for the theft.</p>
<p>Edward worked steadily along, and in time became a full partner in
his master’s business. George did not improve; he kept the loving hearts
of his aged benefactors full of trouble, and their hands full of
inventive activities to protect him from ruin. Edward, as a boy, had
interested himself in Sunday-schools, debating societies, penny
missionary affairs, anti-tobacco organizations, anti-profanity
associations, and all such things; as a man, he was a quiet but steady
and reliable helper in the church, the temperance societies, and in all
movements looking to the aiding and uplifting of men. This excited no
remark, attracted no attention–for it was his “natural bent.“</p>
<p>Finally, the old people died. The will testified their loving pride
in Edward, and left their little property to George –because he “needed
it“; whereas, “owing to a bountiful Providence,“ such was not the case
with Edward. The property was left to George conditionally: he must buy
out Edward’s partner with it; else it must go to a benevolent
organization called the Prisoner’s Friend Society. The old people left a
letter, in which they begged their dear son Edward to take their place
and watch over George, and help and shield him as they had done.</p>
<p>Edward dutifully acquiesced, and George became his partner in the
business. He was not a valuable partner: he had been meddling with drink
before; he soon developed into a constant tippler now, and his flesh and
eyes showed the fact unpleasantly. Edward had been courting a sweet and
kindly spirited girl for some time. They loved each other dearly,
and–But about this period George began to haunt her tearfully and
imploringly, and at last she went crying to Edward, and said her high
and holy duty was plain before her –she must not let her own selfish
desires interfere with it: she must marry “poor George“ and “reform
him.“ It would break her heart, she knew it would, and so on; but duty
was duty. So she married George, and Edward’s heart came very near
breaking, as well as her own. However, Edward recovered, and married
another girl –a very excellent one she was, too.</p>
<p>Children came to both families. Mary did her honest best to reform
her husband, but the contract was too large. George went on drinking,
and by and by he fell to misusing her and the little ones sadly. A great
many good people strove with George–they were always at it, in fact–but
he calmly took such efforts as his due and their duty, and did not mend
his ways. He added a vice, presently–that of secret gambling. He got
deeply in debt; he borrowed money on the firm’s credit, as quietly as he
could, and carried this system so far and so successfully that one
morning the sheriff took possession of the establishment, and the two
cousins found themselves penniless.</p>
<p>Times were hard, now, and they grew worse. Edward moved his family
into a garret, and walked the streets day and night, seeking work. He
begged for it, but it was really not to be had. He was astonished to see
how soon his face became unwelcome; he was astonished and hurt to see
how quickly the ancient interest which people had had in him faded out
and disappeared. Still, he MUST get work; so he swallowed his chagrin,
and toiled on in search of it. At last he got a job of carrying bricks
up a ladder in a hod, and was a grateful man in consequence; but after
that NOBODY knew him or cared anything about him. He was not able to
keep up his dues in the various moral organizations to which he
belonged, and had to endure the sharp pain of seeing himself brought
under the disgrace of suspension.</p>
<p>But the faster Edward died out of public knowledge and interest, the
faster George rose in them. He was found lying, ragged and drunk, in the
gutter one morning. A member of the Ladies’ Temperance Refuge fished him
out, took him in hand, got up a subscription for him, kept him sober a
whole week, then got a situation for him. An account of it was
published.</p>
<p>General attention was thus drawn to the poor fellow, and a great many
people came forward and helped him toward reform with their countenance
and encouragement. He did not drink a drop for two months, and meantime
was the pet of the good. Then he fell–in the gutter; and there was
general sorrow and lamentation. But the noble sisterhood rescued him
again. They cleaned him up, they fed him, they listened to the mournful
music of his repentances, they got him his situation again. An account
of this, also, was published, and the town was drowned in happy tears
over the re-restoration of the poor beast and struggling victim of the
fatal bowl. A grand temperance revival was got up, and after some
rousing speeches had been made the chairman said, impressively: “We are
not about to call for signers; and I think there is a spectacle in store
for you which not many in this house will be able to view with dry
eyes.“ There was an eloquent pause, and then George Benton, escorted by
a red-sashed detachment of the Ladies of the Refuge, stepped forward
upon the platform and signed the pledge. The air was rent with applause,
and everybody cried for joy. Everybody wrung the hand of the new convert
when the meeting was over; his salary was enlarged next day; he was the
talk of the town, and its hero. An account of it was published.</p>
<p>George Benton fell, regularly, every three months, but was faithfully
rescued and wrought with, every time, and good situations were found for
him. Finally, he was taken around the country lecturing, as a reformed
drunkard, and he had great houses and did an immense amount of good.</p>
<p>He was so popular at home, and so trusted–during his sober intervals
–that he was enabled to use the name of a principal citizen, and get a
large sum of money at the bank. A mighty pressure was brought to bear to
save him from the consequences of his forgery, and it was partially
successful–he was “sent up“ for only two years. When, at the end of a
year, the tireless efforts of the benevolent were crowned with success,
and he emerged from the penitentiary with a pardon in his pocket, the
Prisoner’s Friend Society met him at the door with a situation and a
comfortable salary, and all the other benevolent people came forward and
gave him advice, encouragement and help. Edward Mills had once applied
to the Prisoner’s Friend Society for a situation, when in dire need, but
the question, “Have you been a prisoner?“ made brief work of his
case.</p>
<p>While all these things were going on, Edward Mills had been quietly
making head against adversity. He was still poor, but was in receipt of
a steady and sufficient salary, as the respected and trusted cashier of
a bank. George Benton never came near him, and was never heard to
inquire about him. George got to indulging in long absences from the
town; there were ill reports about him, but nothing definite.</p>
<p>One winter’s night some masked burglars forced their way into the
bank, and found Edward Mills there alone. They commanded him to reveal
the “combination,“ so that they could get into the safe. He refused.
They threatened his life. He said his employers trusted him, and he
could not be traitor to that trust. He could die, if he must, but while
he lived he would be faithful; he would not yield up the “combination.“
The burglars killed him.</p>
<p>The detectives hunted down the criminals; the chief one proved to be
George Benton. A wide sympathy was felt for the widow and orphans of the
dead man, and all the newspapers in the land begged that all the banks
in the land would testify their appreciation of the fidelity and heroism
of the murdered cashier by coming forward with a generous contribution
of money in aid of his family, now bereft of support. The result was a
mass of solid cash amounting to upward of five hundred dollars–an
average of nearly three-eights of a cent for each bank in the Union. The
cashier’s own bank testified its gratitude by endeavoring to show (but
humiliatingly failed in it) that the peerless servant’s accounts were
not square, and that he himself had knocked his brains out with a
bludgeon to escape detection and punishment.</p>
<p>George Benton was arraigned for trial. Then everybody seemed to
forget the widow and orphans in their solicitude for poor George.
Everything that money and influence could do was done to save him, but
it all failed; he was sentenced to death. Straightway the Governor was
besieged with petitions for commutation or pardon; they were brought by
tearful young girls; by sorrowful old maids; by deputations of pathetic
widows; by shoals of impressive orphans. But no, the Governor–for
once–would not yield.</p>
<p>Now George Benton experienced religion. The glad news flew all
around. From that time forth his cell was always full of girls and women
and fresh flowers; all the day long there was prayer, and hymn-singing,
and thanksgiving, and homilies, and tears, with never an interruption,
except an occasional five-minute intermission for refreshments.</p>
<p>This sort of thing continued up to the very gallows, and George
Benton went proudly home, in the black cap, before a wailing audience of
the sweetest and best that the region could produce. His grave had fresh
flowers on it every day, for a while, and the head-stone bore these
words, under a hand pointing aloft: “He has fought the good fight.“</p>
<p>The brave cashier’s head-stone has this inscription: “Be pure,
honest, sober, industrious, considerate, and you will never–“</p>
<p>Nobody knows who gave the order to leave it that way, but it was so
given.</p>
<p>The cashier’s family are in stringent circumstances, now, it is said;
but no matter; a lot of appreciative people, who were not willing that
an act so brave and true as his should go unrewarded, have collected
forty-two thousand dollars–and built a Memorial Church with it.</p>
