<h4 id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</h4>
<p>The Stranger had seen everything, he had been everywhere, he knew
everything, and he forgot nothing. What another must study, he learned
at a glance; there were no difficulties for him. And he made things live
before you when he told about them. He saw the world made; he saw Adam
created; he saw Samson surge against the pillars and bring the temple
down in ruins about him; he saw Caesar’s death; he told of the daily
life in heaven; he had seen the damned writhing in the red waves of
hell; and he made us see all these things, and it was as if we were on
the spot and looking at them with our own eyes. And we felt them, too,
but there was no sign that they were anything to him beyond mere
entertainments. Those visions of hell, those poor babes and women and
girls and lads and men shrieking and supplicating in anguish–why, we
could hardly bear it, but he was as bland about it as if it had been so
many imitation rats in an artificial fire.</p>
<p>And always when he was talking about men and women here on the earth
and their doings–even their grandest and sublimest–we were secretly
ashamed, for his manner showed that to him they and their doings were of
paltry poor consequence; often you would think he was talking about
flies, if you didn’t know. Once he even said, in so many words, that our
people down here were quite interesting to him, notwithstanding they
were so dull and ignorant and trivial and conceited, and so diseased and
rickety, and such a shabby, poor, worthless lot all around. He said it
in a quite matter-of-course way and without bitterness, just as a person
might talk about bricks or manure or any other thing that was of no
consequence and hadn’t feelings. I could see he meant no offense, but in
my thoughts I set it down as not very good manners.</p>
<p>“Manners!“ he said. “Why, it is merely the truth, and truth is good
manners; manners are a fiction. The castle is done. Do you like it?“</p>
<p>Any one would have been obliged to like it. It was lovely to look at,
it was so shapely and fine, and so cunningly perfect in all its
particulars, even to the little flags waving from the turrets. Satan
said we must put the artillery in place now, and station the halberdiers
and display the cavalry. Our men and horses were a spectacle to see,
they were so little like what they were intended for; for, of course, we
had no art in making such things. Satan said they were the worst he had
seen; and when he touched them and made them alive, it was just
ridiculous the way they acted, on account of their legs not being of
uniform lengths. They reeled and sprawled around as if they were drunk,
and endangered everybody’s lives around them, and finally fell over and
lay helpless and kicking. It made us all laugh, though it was a shameful
thing to see. The guns were charged with dirt, to fire a salute, but
they were so crooked and so badly made that they all burst when they
went off, and killed some of the gunners and crippled the others. Satan
said we would have a storm now, and an earthquake, if we liked, but we
must stand off a piece, out of danger. We wanted to call the people
away, too, but he said never mind them; they were of no consequence, and
we could make more, some time or other, if we needed them.</p>
<p>A small storm-cloud began to settle down black over the castle, and
the miniature lightning and thunder began to play, and the ground to
quiver, and the wind to pipe and wheeze, and the rain to fall, and all
the people flocked into the castle for shelter. The cloud settled down
blacker and blacker, and one could see the castle only dimly through it;
the lightning blazed out flash upon flash and pierced the castle and set
it on fire, and the flames shone out red and fierce through the cloud,
and the people came flying out, shrieking, but Satan brushed them back,
paying no attention to our begging and crying and imploring; and in the
midst of the howling of the wind and volleying of the thunder the
magazine blew up, the earthquake rent the ground wide, and the castle’s
wreck and ruin tumbled into the chasm, which swallowed it from sight,
and closed upon it, with all that innocent life, not one of the five
hundred poor creatures escaping. Our hearts were broken; we could not
keep from crying.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry,“ Satan said; “they were of no value.“</p>
<p>“But they are gone to hell!“</p>
<p>“Oh, it is no matter; we can make plenty more.“</p>
<p>It was of no use to try to move him; evidently he was wholly without
feeling, and could not understand. He was full of bubbling spirits, and
as gay as if this were a wedding instead of a fiendish massacre. And he
was bent on making us feel as he did, and of course his magic
accomplished his desire. It was no trouble to him; he did whatever he
pleased with us. In a little while we were dancing on that grave, and he
was playing to us on a strange, sweet instrument which he took out of
his pocket; and the music–but there is no music like that, unless
perhaps in heaven, and that was where he brought it from, he said. It
made one mad, for pleasure; and we could not take our eyes from him, and
the looks that went out of our eyes came from our hearts, and their dumb
speech was worship. He brought the dance from heaven, too, and the bliss
of paradise was in it.</p>
<p>Presently he said he must go away on an errand. But we could not bear
the thought of it, and clung to him, and pleaded with him to stay; and
that pleased him, and he said so, and said he would not go yet, but
would wait a little while and we would sit down and talk a few minutes
longer; and he told us Satan was only his real name, and he was to be
known by it to us alone, but he had chosen another one to be called by
in the presence of others; just a common one, such as people have–Philip
Traum.</p>
<p>It sounded so odd and mean for such a being! But it was his decision,
and we said nothing; his decision was sufficient.</p>
<p>We had seen wonders this day; and my thoughts began to run on the
pleasure it would be to tell them when I got home, but he noticed those
thoughts, and said:</p>
<p>“No, all these matters are a secret among us four. I do not mind your
trying to tell them, if you like, but I will protect your tongues, and
nothing of the secret will escape from them.“</p>
<p>It was a disappointment, but it couldn’t be helped, and it cost us a
sigh or two. We talked pleasantly along, and he was always reading our
thoughts and responding to them, and it seemed to me that this was the
most wonderful of all the things he did, but he interrupted my musings
and said:</p>
<p>“No, it would be wonderful for you, but it is not wonderful for me. I
am not limited like you. I am not subject to human conditions. I can
measure and understand your human weaknesses, for I have studied them;
but I have none of them. My flesh is not real, although it would seem
firm to your touch; my clothes are not real; I am a spirit. Father Peter
is coming.“ We looked around, but did not see any one. “He is not in
sight yet, but you will see him presently.“</p>
<p>“Do you know him, Satan?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Won’t you talk with him when he comes? He is not ignorant and dull,
like us, and he would so like to talk with you. Will you?“</p>
<p>“Another time, yes, but not now. I must go on my errand after a
little. There he is now; you can see him. Sit still, and don’t say
anything.“</p>
<p>We looked up and saw Father Peter approaching through the chestnuts.
We three were sitting together in the grass, and Satan sat in front of
us in the path. Father Peter came slowly along with his head down,
thinking, and stopped within a couple of yards of us and took off his
hat and got out his silk handkerchief, and stood there mopping his face
and looking as if he were going to speak to us, but he didn’t. Presently
he muttered, “I can’t think what brought me here; it seems as if I were
in my study a minute ago–but I suppose I have been dreaming along for an
hour and have come all this stretch without noticing; for I am not
myself in these troubled days.“ Then he went mumbling along to himself
and walked straight through Satan, just as if nothing were there. It
made us catch our breath to see it. We had the impulse to cry out, the
way you nearly always do when a startling thing happens, but something
mysteriously restrained us and we remained quiet, only breathing fast.
Then the trees hid Father Peter after a little, and Satan said:</p>
<p>“It is as I told you–I am only a spirit.“</p>
<p>“Yes, one perceives it now,“ said Nikolaus, “but we are not spirits.
It is plain he did not see you, but were we invisible, too? He looked at
us, but he didn’t seem to see us.“</p>
<p>“No, none of us was visible to him, for I wished it so.“</p>
<p>It seemed almost too good to be true, that we were actually seeing
these romantic and wonderful things, and that it was not a dream. And
there he sat, looking just like anybody–so natural and simple and
charming, and chatting along again the same as ever, and–well, words
cannot make you understand what we felt. It was an ecstasy; and an
ecstasy is a thing that will not go into words; it feels like music, and
one cannot tell about music so that another person can get the feeling
of it. He was back in the old ages once more now, and making them live
before us. He had seen so much, so much! It was just a wonder to look at
him and try to think how it must seem to have such experience behind
one.</p>
<p>But it made you seem sorrowfully trivial, and the creature of a day,
and such a short and paltry day, too. And he didn’t say anything to
raise up your drooping pride–no, not a word. He always spoke of men in
the same old indifferent way–just as one speaks of bricks and
manure-piles and such things; you could see that they were of no
consequence to him, one way or the other. He didn’t mean to hurt us, you
could see that; just as we don’t mean to insult a brick when we
disparage it; a brick’s emotions are nothing to us; it never occurs to
us to think whether it has any or not.</p>
<p>Once when he was bunching the most illustrious kings and conquerors
and poets and prophets and pirates and beggars together–just a
brick-pile–I was shamed into putting in a word for man, and asked him
why he made so much difference between men and himself. He had to
struggle with that a moment; he didn’t seem to understand how I could
ask such a strange question. Then he said:</p>
<p>“The difference between man and me? The difference between a mortal
and an immortal? between a cloud and a spirit?“ He picked up a
wood-louse that was creeping along a piece of bark: “What is the
difference between Caesar and this?“</p>
<p>I said, “One cannot compare things which by their nature and by the
interval between them are not comparable.“</p>
<p>“You have answered your own question,“ he said. “I will expand it.
Man is made of dirt–I saw him made. I am not made of dirt. Man is a
museum of diseases, a home of impurities; he comes to-day and is gone
to-morrow; he begins as dirt and departs as stench; I am of the
aristocracy of the Imperishables. And man has the Moral Sense. You
understand? He has the Moral Sense. That would seem to be difference
enough between us, all by itself.“</p>
<p>He stopped there, as if that settled the matter. I was sorry, for at
that time I had but a dim idea of what the Moral Sense was. I merely
knew that we were proud of having it, and when he talked like that about
it, it wounded me, and I felt as a girl feels who thinks her dearest
finery is being admired and then overhears strangers making fun of it.
For a while we were all silent, and I, for one, was depressed. Then
Satan began to chat again, and soon he was sparkling along in such a
cheerful and vivacious vein that my spirits rose once more. He told some
very cunning things that put us in a gale of laughter; and when he was
telling about the time that Samson tied the torches to the foxes’ tails
and set them loose in the Philistines’ corn, and Samson sitting on the
fence slapping his thighs and laughing, with the tears running down his
cheeks, and lost his balance and fell off the fence, the memory of that
picture got him to laughing, too, and we did have a most lovely and
jolly time. By and by he said:</p>
<p>“I am going on my errand now.“</p>
<p>“Don’t!“ we all said. “Don’t go; stay with us. You won’t come
back.“</p>
<p>“Yes, I will; I give you my word.“</p>
<p>“When? To-night? Say when.“</p>
<p>“It won’t be long. You will see.“</p>
<p>“We like you.“</p>
<p>“And I you. And as a proof of it I will show you something fine to
see. Usually when I go I merely vanish; but now I will dissolve myself
and let you see me do it.“</p>
<p>He stood up, and it was quickly finished. He thinned away and thinned
away until he was a soap-bubble, except that he kept his shape. You
could see the bushes through him as clearly as you see things through a
soap-bubble, and all over him played and flashed the delicate iridescent
colors of the bubble, and along with them was that thing shaped like a
window-sash which you always see on the globe of the bubble. You have
seen a bubble strike the carpet and lightly bound along two or three
times before it bursts. He did that. He sprang–touched the grass
–bounded–floated along–touched again–and so on, and presently
exploded–puff! and in his place was vacancy.</p>
<p>It was a strange and beautiful thing to see. We did not say anything,
but sat wondering and dreaming and blinking; and finally Seppi roused up
and said, mournfully sighing:</p>
<p>“I suppose none of it has happened.“</p>
<p>Nikolaus sighed and said about the same.</p>
<p>I was miserable to hear them say it, for it was the same cold fear
that was in my own mind. Then we saw poor old Father Peter wandering
along back, with his head bent down, searching the ground. When he was
pretty close to us he looked up and saw us, and said, “How long have you
been here, boys?“</p>
<p>“A little while, Father.“</p>
<p>“Then it is since I came by, and maybe you can help me. Did you come
up by the path?“</p>
<p>“Yes, Father.“</p>
<p>“That is good. I came the same way. I have lost my wallet. There
wasn’t much in it, but a very little is much to me, for it was all I
had. I suppose you haven’t seen anything of it?“</p>
<p>“No, Father, but we will help you hunt.“</p>
<p>“It is what I was going to ask you. Why, here it is!“</p>
<p>We hadn’t noticed it; yet there it lay, right where Satan stood when
he began to melt–if he did melt and it wasn’t a delusion. Father Peter
picked it up and looked very much surprised.</p>
<p>“It is mine,“ he said, “but not the contents. This is fat; mine was
flat; mine was light; this is heavy.“ He opened it; it was stuffed as
full as it could hold with gold coins. He let us gaze our fill; and of
course we did gaze, for we had never seen so much money at one time
before. All our mouths came open to say “Satan did it!“ but nothing came
out. There it was, you see–we couldn’t tell what Satan didn’t want told;
he had said so himself.</p>
<p>“Boys, did you do this?“</p>
<p>It made us laugh. And it made him laugh, too, as soon as he thought
what a foolish question it was.</p>
<p>“Who has been here?“</p>
<p>Our mouths came open to answer, but stood so for a moment, because we
couldn’t say “Nobody,“ for it wouldn’t be true, and the right word
didn’t seem to come; then I thought of the right one, and said it:</p>
<p>“Not a human being.“</p>
<p>“That is so,“ said the others, and let their mouths go shut.</p>
<p>“It is not so,“ said Father Peter, and looked at us very severely. “I
came by here a while ago, and there was no one here, but that is
nothing; some one has been here since. I don’t mean to say that the
person didn’t pass here before you came, and I don’t mean to say you saw
him, but some one did pass, that I know. On your honor–you saw no
one?“</p>
<p>“Not a human being.“</p>
<p>“That is sufficient; I know you are telling me the truth.“</p>
<p>He began to count the money on the path, we on our knees eagerly
helping to stack it in little piles.</p>
<p>“It’s eleven hundred ducats odd!“ he said. “Oh dear! if it were only
mine–and I need it so!“ and his voice broke and his lips quivered.</p>
<p>“It is yours, sir!“ we all cried out at once, “every heller!“</p>
<p>“No–it isn’t mine. Only four ducats are mine; the rest…!“ He fell to
dreaming, poor old soul, and caressing some of the coins in his hands,
and forgot where he was, sitting there on his heels with his old gray
head bare; it was pitiful to see. “No,“ he said, waking up, “it isn’t
mine. I can’t account for it. I think some enemy… it must be a
trap.“</p>
<p>Nikolaus said: “Father Peter, with the exception of the astrologer
you haven’t a real enemy in the village–nor Marget, either. And not even
a half-enemy that’s rich enough to chance eleven hundred ducats to do
you a mean turn. I’ll ask you if that’s so or not?“</p>
<p>He couldn’t get around that argument, and it cheered him up. “But it
isn’t mine, you see–it isn’t mine, in any case.“</p>
<p>He said it in a wistful way, like a person that wouldn’t be sorry,
but glad, if anybody would contradict him.</p>
<p>“It is yours, Father Peter, and we are witness to it. Aren’t we,
boys?“</p>
<p>“Yes, we are–and we’ll stand by it, too.“</p>
<p>“Bless your hearts, you do almost persuade me; you do, indeed. If I
had only a hundred-odd ducats of it! The house is mortgaged for it, and
we’ve no home for our heads if we don’t pay to-morrow. And that four
ducats is all we’ve got in the–“</p>
<p>“It’s yours, every bit of it, and you’ve got to take it–we are bail
that it’s all right. Aren’t we, Theodor? Aren’t we, Seppi?“</p>
<p>We two said yes, and Nikolaus stuffed the money back into the shabby
old wallet and made the owner take it. So he said he would use two
hundred of it, for his house was good enough security for that, and
would put the rest at interest till the rightful owner came for it; and
on our side we must sign a paper showing how he got the money–a paper to
show to the villagers as proof that he had not got out of his troubles
dishonestly.</p>
