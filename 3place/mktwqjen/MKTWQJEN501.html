<h4 id="chapter-xi.">CHAPTER XI.</h4>
<p>KNIGHT-ERRANTRY AS A TRADE</p>
<p>Sandy and I were on the road again, next morning, bright and early.
It was so good to open up one’s lungs and take in whole luscious
barrels-ful of the blessed God’s untainted, dew-fashioned,
woodland-scented air once more, after suffocating body and mind for two
days and nights in the moral and physical stenches of that intolerable
old buzzard-roost! I mean, for me: of course the place was all right and
agreeable enough for Sandy, for she had been used to high life all her
days.</p>
<p>Poor girl, her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while, and I
was expecting to get the consequences. I was right; but she had stood by
me most helpfully in the castle, and had mightily supported and
reinforced me with gigantic foolishnesses which were worth more for the
occasion than wisdoms double their size; so I thought she had earned a
right to work her mill for a while, if she wanted to, and I felt not a
pang when she started it up:</p>
<p>“Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty
winter of age southward–“</p>
<p>“Are you going to see if you can work up another half-stretch on the
trail of the cowboys, Sandy?“</p>
<p>“Even so, fair my lord.“</p>
<p>“Go ahead, then. I won’t interrupt this time, if I can help it. Begin
over again; start fair, and shake out all your reefs, and I will load my
pipe and give good attention.“</p>
<p>“Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty
winter of age southward. And so they came into a deep forest, and by
fortune they were nighted, and rode along in a deep way, and at the last
they came into a courtelage where abode the duke of South Marches, and
there they asked harbour. And on the morn the duke sent unto Sir
Marhaus, and bad him make him ready. And so Sir Marhaus arose and armed
him, and there was a mass sung afore him, and he brake his fast, and so
mounted on horseback in the court of the castle, there they should do
the battle. So there was the duke already on horseback, clean armed, and
his six sons by him, and every each had a spear in his hand, and so they
encountered, whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears upon
him, but Sir Marhaus held up his spear and touched none of them. Then
came the four sons by couples, and two of them brake their spears, and
so did the other two. And all this while Sir Marhaus touched them not.
Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke, and smote him with his spear that
horse and man fell to the earth. And so he served his sons. And then Sir
Marhaus alight down, and bad the duke yield him or else he would slay
him. And then some of his sons recovered, and would have set upon Sir
Marhaus. Then Sir Marhaus said to the duke, Cease thy sons, or else I
will do the uttermost to you all. When the duke saw he might not escape
the death, he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them to Sir
Marhaus. And they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their swords
to the knight, and so he received them. And then they holp up their
father, and so by their common assent promised unto Sir Marhaus never to
be foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon at Whitsuntide after, to come he
and his sons, and put them in the king’s grace.*</p>
<p>[*Footnote: The story is borrowed, language and all, from the Morte
d’Arthur.–M.T.]</p>
<p>“Even so standeth the history, fair Sir Boss. Now ye shall wit that
that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days past you also
did overcome and send to Arthur’s court!“</p>
<p>“Why, Sandy, you can’t mean it!“</p>
<p>“An I speak not sooth, let it be the worse for me.“</p>
<p>“Well, well, well,–now who would ever have thought it? One whole duke
and six dukelets; why, Sandy, it was an elegant haul. Knight-errantry is
a most chuckle-headed trade, and it is tedious hard work, too, but I
begin to see that there <em>is</em> money in it, after all, if you have
luck. Not that I would ever engage in it as a business, for I wouldn’t.
No sound and legitimate business can be established on a basis of
speculation. A successful whirl in the knight-errantry line–now what is
it when you blow away the nonsense and come down to the cold facts? It’s
just a corner in pork, that’s all, and you can’t make anything else out
of it. You’re rich–yes,–suddenly rich–for about a day, maybe a week;
then somebody corners the market on <em>you</em>, and down goes your
bucket-shop; ain’t that so, Sandy?“</p>
<p>“Whethersoever it be that my mind miscarrieth, bewraying simple
language in such sort that the words do seem to come endlong and
overthwart–“</p>
<p>“There’s no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around it
that way, Sandy, it’s <em>so</em>, just as I say. I <em>know</em> it’s
so. And, moreover, when you come right down to the bedrock,
knight-errantry is <em>worse</em> than pork; for whatever happens, the
pork’s left, and so somebody’s benefited anyway; but when the market
breaks, in a knight-errantry whirl, and every knight in the pool passes
in his checks, what have you got for assets? Just a rubbish-pile of
battered corpses and a barrel or two of busted hardware. Can you call
<em>those</em> assets? Give me pork, every time. Am I right?“</p>
<p>“Ah, peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold matters
whereunto the confusions of these but late adventured haps and
fortunings whereby not I alone nor you alone, but every each of us,
meseemeth–“</p>
<p>“No, it’s not your head, Sandy. Your head’s all right, as far as it
goes, but you don’t know business; that’s where the trouble is. It
unfits you to argue about business, and you’re wrong to be always
trying. However, that aside, it was a good haul, anyway, and will breed
a handsome crop of reputation in Arthur’s court. And speaking of the
cowboys, what a curious country this is for women and men that never get
old. Now there’s Morgan le Fay, as fresh and young as a Vassar pullet,
to all appearances, and here is this old duke of the South Marches still
slashing away with sword and lance at his time of life, after raising
such a family as he has raised. As I understand it, Sir Gawaine killed
seven of his sons, and still he had six left for Sir Marhaus and me to
take into camp. And then there was that damsel of sixty winter of age
still excursioning around in her frosty bloom–How old are you,
Sandy?“</p>
<p>It was the first time I ever struck a still place in her. The mill
had shut down for repairs, or something.</p>
