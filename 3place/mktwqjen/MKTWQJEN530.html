<h4 id="chapter-iv.">CHAPTER IV.</h4>
<p>The day wore itself out. After dinner the two friends put in a long
and harassing evening trying to decide what to do with the five thousand
dollars reward which they were going to get when they should find One-
Armed Pete, and catch him, and prove him to be the right person, and
extradite him, and ship him to Tahlequah in the Indian Territory. But
there were so many dazzling openings for ready cash that they found it
impossible to make up their minds and keep them made up. Finally,
Mrs. Sellers grew very weary of it all, and said:</p>
<p>“What is the sense in cooking a rabbit before it’s caught?“</p>
<p>Then the matter was dropped, for the time being, and all went to bed.
Next morning, being persuaded by Hawkins, the colonel made drawings and
specifications and went down and applied for a patent for his toy
puzzle, and Hawkins took the toy itself and started out to see what
chance there might be to do something with it commercially. He did not
have to go far. In a small old wooden shanty which had once been
occupied as a dwelling by some humble negro family he found a keen-eyed
Yankee engaged in repairing cheap chairs and other second-hand
furniture. This man examined the toy indifferently; attempted to do the
puzzle; found it not so easy as he had expected; grew more interested,
and finally emphatically so; achieved a success at last, and asked:</p>
<p>“Is it patented?“</p>
<p>“Patent applied for.“</p>
<p>“That will answer. What do you want for it?“</p>
<p>“What will it retail for?“</p>
<p>“Well, twenty-five cents, I should think.“</p>
<p>“What will you give for the exclusive right?“</p>
<p>“I couldn’t give twenty dollars, if I had to pay cash down; but I’ll
tell you what I’ll do. I’ll make it and market it, and pay you five
cents royalty on each one.“</p>
<p>Washington sighed. Another dream disappeared; no money in the thing.
So he said:</p>
<p>“All right, take it at that. Draw me a paper.“ He went his way with
the paper, and dropped the matter out of his mind dropped it out to make
room for further attempts to think out the most promising way to invest
his half of the reward, in case a partnership investment satisfactory to
both beneficiaries could not be hit upon.</p>
<p>He had not been very long at home when Sellers arrived sodden with
grief and booming with glad excitement–working both these emotions
successfully, sometimes separately, sometimes together. He fell on
Hawkins’s neck sobbing, and said:</p>
<p>“Oh, mourn with me my friend, mourn for my desolate house: death has
smitten my last kinsman and I am Earl of Rossmore–congratulate me!“</p>
<p>He turned to his wife, who had entered while this was going on, put
his arms about her and said–“You will bear up, for my sake, my lady–it
had to happen, it was decreed.“</p>
<p>She bore up very well, and said:</p>
<p>“It’s no great loss. Simon Lathers was a poor well-meaning useless
thing and no account, and his brother never was worth shucks.“</p>
<p>The rightful earl continued:</p>
<p>“I am too much prostrated by these conflicting griefs and joys to be
able to concentrate my mind upon affairs; I will ask our good friend
here to break the news by wire or post to the Lady Gwendolen and
instruct her to–“</p>
<p>“What Lady Gwendolen?“</p>
<p>“Our poor daughter, who, alas!–“</p>
<p>“Sally Sellers? Mulberry Sellers, are you losing your mind?“</p>
<p>“There–please do not forget who you are, and who I am; remember your
own dignity, be considerate also of mine. It were best to cease from
using my family name, now, Lady Rossmore.“</p>
<p>“Goodness gracious, well, I never! What am I to call you then?“</p>
<p>“In private, the ordinary terms of endearment will still be
admissible, to some degree; but in public it will be more becoming if
your ladyship will speak to me as my lord, or your lordship, and of me
as Rossmore, or the Earl, or his Lordship, and–“</p>
<p>“Oh, scat! I can’t ever do it, Berry.“</p>
<p>“But indeed you must, my love–we must live up to our altered position
and submit with what grace we may to its requirements.“</p>
<p>“Well, all right, have it your own way; I’ve never set my wishes
against your commands yet, Mul–my lord, and it’s late to begin now,
though to my mind it’s the rottenest foolishness that ever was.“</p>
<p>“Spoken like my own true wife! There, kiss and be friends again.“</p>
<p>“But–Gwendolen! I don’t know how I am ever going to stand that name.
Why, a body wouldn’t know Sally Sellers in it. It’s too large for her;
kind of like a cherub in an ulster, and it’s a most outlandish sort of a
name, anyway, to my mind.“</p>
<p>“You’ll not hear her find fault with it, my lady.“</p>
<p>“That’s a true word. She takes to any kind of romantic rubbish like
she was born to it. She never got it from me, that’s sure. And sending
her to that silly college hasn’t helped the matter any–just the other
way.“</p>
<p>“Now hear her, Hawkins! Rowena-Ivanhoe College is the selectest and
most aristocratic seat of learning for young ladies in our country.
Under no circumstances can a girl get in there unless she is either very
rich and fashionable or can prove four generations of what may be called
American nobility. Castellated college-buildings–towers and turrets and
an imitation moat–and everything about the place named out of Sir Walter
Scott’s books and redolent of royalty and state and style; and all the
richest girls keep phaetons, and coachmen in livery, and riding-horses,
with English grooms in plug hats and tight-buttoned coats, and
top-boots, and a whip-handle without any whip to it, to ride sixty-three
feet behind them–“</p>
<p>“And they don’t learn a blessed thing, Washington Hawkins, not a
single blessed thing but showy rubbish and un-american pretentiousness.
But send for the Lady Gwendolen–do; for I reckon the peerage regulations
require that she must come home and let on to go into seclusion and
mourn for those Arkansas blatherskites she’s lost.“</p>
<p>“My darling! Blatherskites? Remember–noblesse oblige.“</p>
<p>“There, there–talk to me in your own tongue, Ross–you don’t know any
other, and you only botch it when you try. Oh, don’t stare–it was a
slip, and no crime; customs of a life-time can’t be dropped in a second.
Rossmore–there, now, be appeased, and go along with you and attend to
Gwendolen. Are you going to write, Washington?–or telegraph?“</p>
<p>“He will telegraph, dear.“</p>
<p>“I thought as much,“ my lady muttered, as she left the room. “Wants
it so the address will have to appear on the envelop. It will just make
a fool of that child. She’ll get it, of course, for if there are any
other Sellerses there they’ll not be able to claim it. And just leave
her alone to show it around and make the most of it. Well, maybe she’s
forgivable for that. She’s so poor and they’re so rich, of course she’s
had her share of snubs from the livery-flunkey sort, and I reckon it’s
only human to want to get even.“</p>
<p>Uncle Dan’l was sent with the telegram; for although a conspicuous
object in a corner of the drawing-room was a telephone hanging on a
transmitter, Washington found all attempts to raise the central office
vain. The Colonel grumbled something about its being “always out of
order when you’ve got particular and especial use for it,“ but he didn’t
explain that one of the reasons for this was that the thing was only a
dummy and hadn’t any wire attached to it. And yet the Colonel often used
it–when visitors were present–and seemed to get messages through it.
Mourning paper and a seal were ordered, then the friends took a
rest.</p>
<p>Next afternoon, while Hawkins, by request, draped Andrew Jackson’s
portrait with crape, the rightful earl, wrote off the family bereavement
to the usurper in England–a letter which we have already read. He also,
by letter to the village authorities at Duffy’s Corners, Arkansas, gave
order that the remains of the late twins be embalmed by some St. Louis
expert and shipped at once to the usurper–with bill. Then he drafted out
the Rossmore arms and motto on a great sheet of brown paper, and he and
Hawkins took it to Hawkins’s Yankee furniture-mender and at the end of
an hour came back with a couple of stunning hatchments, which they
nailed up on the front of the house–attractions calculated to draw, and
they did; for it was mainly an idle and shiftless negro neighborhood,
with plenty of ragged children and indolent dogs to spare for a point of
interest like that, and keep on sparing them for it, days and days
together.</p>
<p>The new earl found–without surprise–this society item in the evening
paper, and cut it out and scrapbooked it:</p>
<p>By a recent bereavement our esteemed fellow citizen, Colonel Mulberry
Sellers, Perpetual Member-at-large of the Diplomatic Body, succeeds, as
rightful lord, to the great earldom of Rossmore, third by order of
precedence in the earldoms of Great Britain, and will take early
measures, by suit in the House of Lords, to wrest the title and estates
from the present usurping holder of them. Until the season of mourning
is past, the usual Thursday evening receptions at Rossmore Towers will
be discontinued.</p>
<p>Lady Rossmore’s comment-to herself:</p>
<p>“Receptions! People who don’t rightly know him may think he is
commonplace, but to my mind he is one of the most unusual men I ever
saw. As for suddenness and capacity in imagining things, his beat don’t
exist, I reckon. As like as not it wouldn’t have occurred to anybody
else to name this poor old rat-trap Rossmore Towers, but it just comes
natural to him. Well, no doubt it’s a blessed thing to have an
imagination that can always make you satisfied, no matter how you are
fixed. Uncle Dave Hopkins used to always say, ‘Turn me into John Calvin,
and I want to know which place I’m going to; turn me into Mulberry
Sellers and I don’t care.’“</p>
<p>The rightful earl’s comment-to himself:</p>
<p>“It’s a beautiful name, beautiful. Pity I didn’t think of it before I
wrote the usurper. But I’ll be ready for him when he answers.“</p>
