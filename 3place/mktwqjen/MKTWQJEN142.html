<h4 id="chapter-lxxvii.">CHAPTER LXXVII.</h4>
<p>I stumbled upon one curious character in the Island of Mani. He
became a sore annoyance to me in the course of time. My first glimpse of
him was in a sort of public room in the town of Lahaina. He occupied a
chair at the opposite side of the apartment, and sat eyeing our party
with interest for some minutes, and listening as critically to what we
were saying as if he fancied we were talking to him and expecting him to
reply. I thought it very sociable in a stranger. Presently, in the
course of conversation, I made a statement bearing upon the subject
under discussion–and I made it with due modesty, for there was nothing
extraordinary about it, and it was only put forth in illustration of a
point at issue. I had barely finished when this person spoke out with
rapid utterance and feverish anxiety:</p>
<p>“Oh, that was certainly remarkable, after a fashion, but you ought to
have seen my chimney–you ought to have seen my chimney, sir! Smoke! I
wish I may hang if–Mr. Jones, you remember that chimney–you must
remember that chimney! No, no–I recollect, now, you warn’t living on
this side of the island then. But I am telling you nothing but the
truth, and I wish I may never draw another breath if that chimney didn’t
smoke so that the smoke actually got caked in it and I had to dig it out
with a pickaxe! You may smile, gentlemen, but the High Sheriff’s got a
hunk of it which I dug out before his eyes, and so it’s perfectly easy
for you to go and examine for yourselves.“</p>
<p>The interruption broke up the conversation, which had already begun
to lag, and we presently hired some natives and an out-rigger canoe or
two, and went out to overlook a grand surf-bathing contest.</p>
<p>Two weeks after this, while talking in a company, I looked up and
detected this same man boring through and through me with his intense
eye, and noted again his twitching muscles and his feverish anxiety to
speak. The moment I paused, he said:</p>
<p>“Beg your pardon, sir, beg your pardon, but it can only be considered
remarkable when brought into strong outline by isolation. Sir,
contrasted with a circumstance which occurred in my own experience, it
instantly becomes commonplace. No, not that–for I will not speak so
discourteously of any experience in the career of a stranger and a
gentleman–but I am obliged to say that you could not, and you would not
ever again refer to this tree as a large one, if you could behold, as I
have, the great Yakmatack tree, in the island of Ounaska, sea of
Kamtchatka–a tree, sir, not one inch less than four hundred and fifteen
feet in solid diameter!–and I wish I may die in a minute if it isn’t so!
Oh, you needn’t look so questioning, gentlemen; here’s old Cap Saltmarsh
can say whether I know what I’m talking about or not. I showed him the
tree.“</p>
<p>Captain Saltmarsh–“Come, now, cat your anchor, lad–you’re heaving too
taut. You promised to show me that stunner, and I walked more than
eleven mile with you through the cussedest jungle I ever see, a hunting
for it; but the tree you showed me finally warn’t as big around as a
beer cask, and you know that your own self, Markiss.“</p>
<p>“Hear the man talk! Of course the tree was reduced that way, but
didn’t I explain it? Answer me, didn’t I? Didn’t I say I wished you
could have seen it when I first saw it? When you got up on your ear and
called me names, and said I had brought you eleven miles to look at a
sapling, didn’t I explain to you that all the whale-ships in the North
Seas had been wooding off of it for more than twenty-seven years? And
did you s’pose the tree could last for-ever, con-found it? I don’t see
why you want to keep back things that way, and try to injure a person
that’s never done you any harm.“</p>
<p>Somehow this man’s presence made me uncomfortable, and I was glad
when a native arrived at that moment to say that Muckawow, the most
companionable and luxurious among the rude war-chiefs of the Islands,
desired us to come over and help him enjoy a missionary whom he had
found trespassing on his grounds.</p>
<p>I think it was about ten days afterward that, as I finished a
statement I was making for the instruction of a group of friends and
acquaintances, and which made no pretence of being extraordinary, a
familiar voice chimed instantly in on the heels of my last word, and
said:</p>
<p>“But, my dear sir, there was nothing remarkable about that horse, or
the circumstance either–nothing in the world! I mean no sort of offence
when I say it, sir, but you really do not know anything whatever about
speed. Bless your heart, if you could only have seen my mare Margaretta;
there was a beast!–there was lightning for you! Trot! Trot is no name
for it–she flew! How she could whirl a buggy along! I started her out
once, sir–Colonel Bilgewater, you recollect that animal perfectly well
–I started her out about thirty or thirty-five yards ahead of the
awfullest storm I ever saw in my life, and it chased us upwards of
eighteen miles! It did, by the everlasting hills! And I’m telling you
nothing but the unvarnished truth when I say that not one single drop of
rain fell on me–not a single drop, sir! And I swear to it! But my dog
was a-swimming behind the wagon all the way!“</p>
<p>For a week or two I stayed mostly within doors, for I seemed to meet
this person everywhere, and he had become utterly hateful to me. But one
evening I dropped in on Captain Perkins and his friends, and we had a
sociable time. About ten o’clock I chanced to be talking about a
merchant friend of mine, and without really intending it, the remark
slipped out that he was a little mean and parsimonious about paying his
workmen. Instantly, through the steam of a hot whiskey punch on the
opposite side of the room, a remembered voice shot–and for a moment I
trembled on the imminent verge of profanity:</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear sir, really you expose yourself when you parade that as
a surprising circumstance. Bless your heart and hide, you are ignorant
of the very A B C of meanness! ignorant as the unborn babe! ignorant as
unborn twins! You don’t know anything about it! It is pitiable to see
you, sir, a well-spoken and prepossessing stranger, making such an
enormous pow-wow here about a subject concerning which your ignorance is
perfectly humiliating! Look me in the eye, if you please; look me in the
eye. John James Godfrey was the son of poor but honest parents in the
State of Mississippi–boyhood friend of mine–bosom comrade in later
years. Heaven rest his noble spirit, he is gone from us now. John James
Godfrey was hired by the Hayblossom Mining Company in California to do
some blasting for them–the “Incorporated Company of Mean Men,“ the boys
used to call it.</p>
<p>“Well, one day he drilled a hole about four feet deep and put in an
awful blast of powder, and was standing over it ramming it down with an
iron crowbar about nine foot long, when the cussed thing struck a spark
and fired the powder, and scat! away John Godfrey whizzed like a
skyrocket, him and his crowbar! Well, sir, he kept on going up in the
air higher and higher, till he didn’t look any bigger than a boy–and he
kept going on up higher and higher, till he didn’t look any bigger than
a doll–and he kept on going up higher and higher, till he didn’t look
any bigger than a little small bee–and then he went out of sight!
Presently he came in sight again, looking like a little small bee–and he
came along down further and further, till he looked as big as a doll
again–and down further and further, till he was as big as a boy
again–and further and further, till he was a full-sized man once more;
and then him and his crowbar came a wh-izzing down and lit right exactly
in the same old tracks and went to r-ramming down, and r-ramming down,
and r-ramming down again, just the same as if nothing had happened! Now
do you know, that poor cuss warn’t gone only sixteen minutes, and yet
that Incorporated Company of Mean Men DOCKED HIM FOR THE LOST TIME!“</p>
<p>I said I had the headache, and so excused myself and went home. And
on my diary I entered “another night spoiled“ by this offensive loafer.
And a fervent curse was set down with it to keep the item company. And
the very next day I packed up, out of all patience, and left the
Island.</p>
<p>Almost from the very beginning, I regarded that man as a liar.</p>
<p>The line of points represents an interval of years. At the end of
which time the opinion hazarded in that last sentence came to be
gratifyingly and remarkably endorsed, and by wholly disinterested
persons. The man Markiss was found one morning hanging to a beam of his
own bedroom (the doors and windows securely fastened on the inside),
dead; and on his breast was pinned a paper in his own handwriting
begging his friends to suspect no innocent person of having any thing to
do with his death, for that it was the work of his own hands entirely.
Yet the jury brought in the astounding verdict that deceased came to his
death “by the hands of some person or persons unknown!“ They explained
that the perfectly undeviating consistency of Markiss’s character for
thirty years towered aloft as colossal and indestructible testimony,
that whatever statement he chose to make was entitled to instant and
unquestioning acceptance as a lie. And they furthermore stated their
belief that he was not dead, and instanced the strong circumstantial
evidence of his own word that he was dead–and beseeched the coroner to
delay the funeral as long as possible, which was done. And so in the
tropical climate of Lahaina the coffin stood open for seven days, and
then even the loyal jury gave him up. But they sat on him again, and
changed their verdict to “suicide induced by mental aberration“–because,
said they, with penetration, “he said he was dead, and he was dead; and
would he have told the truth if he had been in his right mind? No,
sir.“</p>
