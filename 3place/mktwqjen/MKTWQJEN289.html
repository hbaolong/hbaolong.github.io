<h4 id="punch-brothers-punch">PUNCH, BROTHERS, PUNCH</h4>
<p>Will the reader please to cast his eye over the following lines, and
see if he can discover anything harmful in them?</p>
<p>Conductor, when you receive a fare, Punch in the presence of the
passenjare! A blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, A buff trip slip
for a six-cent fare, A pink trip slip for a three-cent fare, Punch in
the presence of the passenjare!</p>
<p>CHORUS</p>
<p>Punch, brothers! punch with care! Punch in the presence of the
passenjare!</p>
<p>I came across these jingling rhymes in a newspaper, a little while
ago, and read them a couple of times. They took instant and entire
possession of me. All through breakfast they went waltzing through my
brain; and when, at last, I rolled up my napkin, I could not tell
whether I had eaten anything or not. I had carefully laid out my day’s
work the day before–thrilling tragedy in the novel which I am writing. I
went to my den to begin my deed of blood. I took up my pen, but all I
could get it to say was, “Punch in the presence of the passenjare.“ I
fought hard for an hour, but it was useless. My head kept humming, “A
blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, a buff trip slip for a six-cent
fare,“ and so on and so on, without peace or respite. The day’s work was
ruined–I could see that plainly enough. I gave up and drifted down-town,
and presently discovered that my feet were keeping time to that
relentless jingle. When I could stand it no longer I altered my step.
But it did no good; those rhymes accommodated themselves to the new step
and went on harassing me just as before. I returned home, and suffered
all the afternoon; suffered all through an unconscious and unrefreshing
dinner; suffered, and cried, and jingled all through the evening; went
to bed and rolled, tossed, and jingled right along, the same as ever;
got up at midnight frantic, and tried to read; but there was nothing
visible upon the whirling page except “Punch! punch in the presence of
the passenjare.“ By sunrise I was out of my mind, and everybody marveled
and was distressed at the idiotic burden of my ravings–“Punch! oh,
punch! punch in the presence of the passenjare!“</p>
<p>Two days later, on Saturday morning, I arose, a tottering wreck, and
went forth to fulfil an engagement with a valued friend, the Rev. Mr.——,
to walk to the Talcott Tower, ten miles distant. He stared at me, but
asked no questions. We started. Mr.—— talked, talked, talked as is his
wont. I said nothing; I heard nothing. At the end of a mile, Mr.—— said
“Mark, are you sick? I never saw a man look so haggard and worn and
absent-minded. Say something, do!“</p>
<p>Drearily, without enthusiasm, I said: “Punch brothers, punch with
care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare!“</p>
<p>My friend eyed me blankly, looked perplexed, they said:</p>
<p>“I do not think I get your drift, Mark. Then does not seem to be any
relevancy in what you have said, certainly nothing sad; and yet–maybe it
was the way you said the words–I never heard anything that sounded so
pathetic. What is–“</p>
<p>But I heard no more. I was already far away with my pitiless,
heartbreaking “blue trip slip for an eight-cent fare, buff trip slip for
a six-cent fare, pink trip slip for a three-cent fare; punch in the
presence of the passenjare.“ I do not know what occurred during the
other nine miles. However, all of a sudden Mr.—— laid his hand on my
shoulder and shouted:</p>
<p>“Oh, wake up! wake up! wake up! Don’t sleep all day! Here we are at
the Tower, man! I have talked myself deaf and dumb and blind, and never
got a response. Just look at this magnificent autumn landscape! Look at
it! look at it! Feast your eye on it! You have traveled; you have seen
boaster landscapes elsewhere. Come, now, deliver an honest opinion. What
do you say to this?“</p>
<p>I sighed wearily; and murmured:</p>
<p>“A buff trip slip for a six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a
three-cent fare, punch in the presence of the passenjare.“</p>
<p>Rev. Mr. —— stood there, very grave, full of concern, apparently, and
looked long at me; then he said:</p>
<p>“Mark, there is something about this that I cannot understand. Those
are about the same words you said before; there does not seem to be
anything in them, and yet they nearly break my heart when you say them.
Punch in the–how is it they go?“</p>
<p>I began at the beginning and repeated all the lines.</p>
<p>My friend’s face lighted with interest. He said:</p>
<p>“Why, what a captivating jingle it is! It is almost music. It flows
along so nicely. I have nearly caught the rhymes myself. Say them over
just once more, and then I’ll have them, sure.“</p>
<p>I said them over. Then Mr. —— said them. He made one little mistake,
which I corrected. The next time and the next he got them right. Now a
great burden seemed to tumble from my shoulders. That torturing jingle
departed out of my brain, and a grateful sense of rest and peace
descended upon me. I was light-hearted enough to sing; and I did sing
for half an hour, straight along, as we went jogging homeward. Then my
freed tongue found blessed speech again, and the pent talk of many a
weary hour began to gush and flow. It flowed on and on, joyously,
jubilantly, until the fountain was empty and dry. As I wrung my friend’s
hand at parting, I said:</p>
<p>“Haven’t we had a royal good time! But now I remember, you haven’t
said a word for two hours. Come, come, out with something!“</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr.—— turned a lack-luster eye upon me, drew a deep sigh,
and said, without animation, without apparent consciousness:</p>
<p>“Punch, brothers, punch with care! Punch in the presence of the
passenjare!“</p>
<p>A pang shot through me as I said to myself, “Poor fellow, poor
fellow! he has got it, now.“</p>
<p>I did not see Mr.—— for two or three days after that. Then, on
Tuesday evening, he staggered into my presence and sank dejectedly into
a seat. He was pale, worn; he was a wreck. He lifted his faded eyes to
my face and said:</p>
<p>“Ah, Mark, it was a ruinous investment that I made in those heartless
rhymes. They have ridden me like a nightmare, day and night, hour after
hour, to this very moment. Since I saw you I have suffered the torments
of the lost. Saturday evening I had a sudden call, by telegraph, and
took the night train for Boston. The occasion was the death of a valued
old friend who had requested that I should preach his funeral sermon. I
took my seat in the cars and set myself to framing the discourse. But I
never got beyond the opening paragraph; for then the train started and
the car-wheels began their ‘clack, clack-clack-clack-clack! clack-clack!
–clack-clack-clack!’ and right away those odious rhymes fitted
themselves to that accompaniment. For an hour I sat there and set a
syllable of those rhymes to every separate and distinct clack the
car-wheels made. Why, I was as fagged out, then, as if I had been
chopping wood all day. My skull was splitting with headache. It seemed
to me that I must go mad if I sat there any longer; so I undressed and
went to bed. I stretched myself out in my berth, and–well, you know what
the result was. The thing went right along, just the same. ‘Clack-clack
clack, a blue trip slip, clack-clack-clack, for an eight cent fare;
clack-clack-clack, a buff trip slip, clack clack-clack, for a six-cent
fare, and so on, and so on, and so on punch in the presence of the
passenjare!’ Sleep? Not a single wink! I was almost a lunatic when I got
to Boston. Don’t ask me about the funeral. I did the best I could, but
every solemn individual sentence was meshed and tangled and woven in and
out with ‘Punch, brothers, punch with care, punch in the presence of the
passenjare.’ And the most distressing thing was that my delivery dropped
into the undulating rhythm of those pulsing rhymes, and I could actually
catch absent-minded people nodding time to the swing of it with their
stupid heads. And, Mark, you may believe it or not, but before I got
through the entire assemblage were placidly bobbing their heads in
solemn unison, mourners, undertaker, and all. The moment I had finished,
I fled to the anteroom in a state bordering on frenzy. Of course it
would be my luck to find a sorrowing and aged maiden aunt of the
deceased there, who had arrived from Springfield too late to get into
the church. She began to sob, and said:</p>
<p>“‘Oh, oh, he is gone, he is gone, and I didn’t see him before he
died!’</p>
<p>“‘Yes!’ I said, ‘he is gone, he is gone, he is gone–oh, will this
suffering never cease!’</p>
<p>“‘You loved him, then! Oh, you too loved him!’</p>
<p>“‘Loved him! Loved who?’</p>
<p>“‘Why, my poor George! my poor nephew!’</p>
<p>“‘Oh–him! Yes–oh, yes, yes. Certainly–certainly. Punch–punch–oh, this
misery will kill me!’</p>
<p>“‘Bless you! bless you, sir, for these sweet words! I, too, suffer in
this dear loss. Were you present during his last moments?’</p>
<p>“‘Yes. I–whose last moments?’</p>
<p>“‘His. The dear departed’s.’</p>
<p>“‘Yes! Oh, yes–yes–yes! I suppose so, I think so, I don’t know! Oh,
certainly–I was there I was there!’</p>
<p>“‘Oh, what a privilege! what a precious privilege! And his last words
–oh, tell me, tell me his last words! What did he say?’</p>
<p>“’He said–he said–oh, my head, my head, my head! He said–he said–he
never said anything but Punch, punch, punch in the presence of the
passenjare! Oh, leave me, madam! In the name of all that is generous,
leave me to my madness, my misery, my despair!–a buff trip slip for a
six-cent fare, a pink trip slip for a three-cent fare–endu–rance can no
fur–ther go!–PUNCH in the presence of the passenjare!“</p>
<p>My friend’s hopeless eyes rested upon mine a pregnant minute, and
then he said impressively:</p>
<p>“Mark, you do not say anything. You do not offer me any hope. But, ah
me, it is just as well–it is just as well. You could not do me any good.
The time has long gone by when words could comfort me. Something tells
me that my tongue is doomed to wag forever to the jigger of that
remorseless jingle. There–there it is coming on me again: a blue trip
slip for an eight-cent fare, a buff trip slip for a–“</p>
<p>Thus murmuring faint and fainter, my friend sank into a peaceful
trance and forgot his sufferings in a blessed respite.</p>
<p>How did I finally save him from an asylum? I took him to a
neighboring university and made him discharge the burden of his
persecuting rhymes into the eager ears of the poor, unthinking students.
How is it with them, now? The result is too sad to tell. Why did I write
this article? It was for a worthy, even a noble, purpose. It was to warn
you, reader, if you should came across those merciless rhymes, to avoid
them–avoid them as you would a pestilence.</p>
