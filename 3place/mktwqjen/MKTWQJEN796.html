<h4 id="chapter-9">CHAPTER 9</h4>
<p>It was wonderful, the mastery Satan had over time and distance. For
him they did not exist. He called them human inventions, and said they
were artificialities. We often went to the most distant parts of the
globe with him, and stayed weeks and months, and yet were gone only a
fraction of a second, as a rule. You could prove it by the clock. One
day when our people were in such awful distress because the witch
commission were afraid to proceed against the astrologer and Father
Peter’s household, or against any, indeed, but the poor and the
friendless, they lost patience and took to witch-hunting on their own
score, and began to chase a born lady who was known to have the habit of
curing people by devilish arts, such as bathing them, washing them, and
nourishing them instead of bleeding them and purging them through the
ministrations of a barber-surgeon in the proper way. She came flying
down, with the howling and cursing mob after her, and tried to take
refuge in houses, but the doors were shut in her face. They chased her
more than half an hour, we following to see it, and at last she was
exhausted and fell, and they caught her. They dragged her to a tree and
threw a rope over the limb, and began to make a noose in it, some
holding her, meantime, and she crying and begging, and her young
daughter looking on and weeping, but afraid to say or do anything.</p>
<p>They hanged the lady, and I threw a stone at her, although in my
heart I was sorry for her; but all were throwing stones and each was
watching his neighbor, and if I had not done as the others did it would
have been noticed and spoken of. Satan burst out laughing.</p>
<p>All that were near by turned upon him, astonished and not pleased. It
was an ill time to laugh, for his free and scoffing ways and his
supernatural music had brought him under suspicion all over the town and
turned many privately against him. The big blacksmith called attention
to him now, raising his voice so that all should hear, and said:</p>
<p>“What are you laughing at? Answer! Moreover, please explain to the
company why you threw no stone.“</p>
<p>“Are you sure I did not throw a stone?“</p>
<p>“Yes. You needn’t try to get out of it; I had my eye on you.“</p>
<p>“And I–I noticed you!“ shouted two others.</p>
<p>“Three witnesses,“ said Satan: “Mueller, the blacksmith; Klein, the
butcher’s man; Pfeiffer, the weaver’s journeyman. Three very ordinary
liars. Are there any more?“</p>
<p>“Never mind whether there are others or not, and never mind about
what you consider us–three’s enough to settle your matter for you.
You’ll prove that you threw a stone, or it shall go hard with you.“</p>
<p>“That’s so!“ shouted the crowd, and surged up as closely as they
could to the center of interest.</p>
<p>“And first you will answer that other question,“ cried the
blacksmith, pleased with himself for being mouthpiece to the public and
hero of the occasion. “What are you laughing at?“</p>
<p>Satan smiled and answered, pleasantly: “To see three cowards stoning
a dying lady when they were so near death themselves.“</p>
<p>You could see the superstitious crowd shrink and catch their breath,
under the sudden shock. The blacksmith, with a show of bravado,
said:</p>
<p>“Pooh! What do you know about it?“</p>
<p>“I? Everything. By profession I am a fortune-teller, and I read the
hands of you three–and some others–when you lifted them to stone the
woman. One of you will die to-morrow week; another of you will die
to-night; the third has but five minutes to live–and yonder is the
clock!“</p>
<p>It made a sensation. The faces of the crowd blanched, and turned
mechanically toward the clock. The butcher and the weaver seemed smitten
with an illness, but the blacksmith braced up and said, with spirit:</p>
<p>“It is not long to wait for prediction number one. If it fails, young
master, you will not live a whole minute after, I promise you that.“</p>
<p>No one said anything; all watched the clock in a deep stillness which
was impressive. When four and a half minutes were gone the blacksmith
gave a sudden gasp and clapped his hands upon his heart, saying, “Give
me breath! Give me room!“ and began to sink down. The crowd surged back,
no one offering to support him, and he fell lumbering to the ground and
was dead. The people stared at him, then at Satan, then at one another;
and their lips moved, but no words came. Then Satan said:</p>
<p>“Three saw that I threw no stone. Perhaps there are others; let them
speak.“</p>
<p>It struck a kind of panic into them, and, although no one answered
him, many began to violently accuse one another, saying, “You said he
didn’t throw,“ and getting for reply, “It is a lie, and I will make you
eat it!“ And so in a moment they were in a raging and noisy turmoil, and
beating and banging one another; and in the midst was the only
indifferent one –the dead lady hanging from her rope, her troubles
forgotten, her spirit at peace.</p>
<p>So we walked away, and I was not at ease, but was saying to myself,
“He told them he was laughing at them, but it was a lie–he was laughing
at me.“</p>
<p>That made him laugh again, and he said, “Yes, I was laughing at you,
because, in fear of what others might report about you, you stoned the
woman when your heart revolted at the act–but I was laughing at the
others, too.“</p>
<p>“Why?“</p>
<p>“Because their case was yours.“</p>
<p>“How is that?“</p>
<p>“Well, there were sixty-eight people there, and sixty-two of them had
no more desire to throw a stone than you had.“</p>
<p>“Satan!“</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s true. I know your race. It is made up of sheep. It is
governed by minorities, seldom or never by majorities. It suppresses its
feelings and its beliefs and follows the handful that makes the most
noise. Sometimes the noisy handful is right, sometimes wrong; but no
matter, the crowd follows it. The vast majority of the race, whether
savage or civilized, are secretly kind-hearted and shrink from
inflicting pain, but in the presence of the aggressive and pitiless
minority they don’t dare to assert themselves. Think of it! One
kind-hearted creature spies upon another, and sees to it that he loyally
helps in iniquities which revolt both of them. Speaking as an expert, I
know that ninety-nine out of a hundred of your race were strongly
against the killing of witches when that foolishness was first agitated
by a handful of pious lunatics in the long ago. And I know that even
to-day, after ages of transmitted prejudice and silly teaching, only one
person in twenty puts any real heart into the harrying of a witch. And
yet apparently everybody hates witches and wants them killed. Some day a
handful will rise up on the other side and make the most noise–perhaps
even a single daring man with a big voice and a determined front will do
it–and in a week all the sheep will wheel and follow him, and
witch-hunting will come to a sudden end.</p>
<p>“Monarchies, aristocracies, and religions are all based upon that
large defect in your race–the individual’s distrust of his neighbor, and
his desire, for safety’s or comfort’s sake, to stand well in his
neighbor’s eye. These institutions will always remain, and always
flourish, and always oppress you, affront you, and degrade you, because
you will always be and remain slaves of minorities. There was never a
country where the majority of the people were in their secret hearts
loyal to any of these institutions.“</p>
<p>I did not like to hear our race called sheep, and said I did not
think they were.</p>
<p>“Still, it is true, lamb,“ said Satan. “Look at you in war–what
mutton you are, and how ridiculous!“</p>
<p>“In war? How?“</p>
<p>“There has never been a just one, never an honorable one–on the part
of the instigator of the war. I can see a million years ahead, and this
rule will never change in so many as half a dozen instances. The loud
little handful–as usual–will shout for the war. The pulpit will –warily
and cautiously–object–at first; the great, big, dull bulk of the nation
will rub its sleepy eyes and try to make out why there should be a war,
and will say, earnestly and indignantly, “It is unjust and dishonorable,
and there is no necessity for it.“ Then the handful will shout louder. A
few fair men on the other side will argue and reason against the war
with speech and pen, and at first will have a hearing and be applauded;
but it will not last long; those others will outshout them, and
presently the anti-war audiences will thin out and lose popularity.
Before long you will see this curious thing: the speakers stoned from
the platform, and free speech strangled by hordes of furious men who in
their secret hearts are still at one with those stoned speakers–as
earlier –but do not dare to say so. And now the whole nation–pulpit and
all –will take up the war-cry, and shout itself hoarse, and mob any
honest man who ventures to open his mouth; and presently such mouths
will cease to open. Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting
the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad
of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them,
and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and
by convince himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the
better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque
self-deception.“</p>
