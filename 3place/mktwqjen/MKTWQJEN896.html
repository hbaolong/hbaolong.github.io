1861-62. ON THE FRONTIER. MINING ADVENTURES. JOURNALISTIC
BEGINNINGS</h4>
<p>Clemens went from the battle-front to Keokuk, where Orion was
preparing to accept the appointment prophesied by Madame Caprell. Orion
was a stanch Unionist, and a member of Lincoln’s Cabinet had offered him
the secretaryship of the new Territory of Nevada. Orion had accepted,
and only needed funds to carry him to his destination. His pilot brother
had the funds, and upon being appointed “private“ secretary, agreed to
pay both passages on the overland stage, which would bear them across
the great plains from St. Jo to Carson City. Mark Twain, in Roughing It,
has described that glorious journey and the frontier life that followed
it. His letters form a supplement of realism to a tale that is more or
less fictitious, though marvelously true in color and background. The
first bears no date, but it was written not long after their arrival,
August 14, 1861. It is not complete, but there is enough of it to give
us a very fair picture of Carson City, “a wooden town; its population
two thousand souls.“</p>
<p>Part of a letter to Mrs. Jane Clemens, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>(Date not given, but Sept, or Oct., 1861.) MY DEAR MOTHER,–I hope you
will all come out here someday. But I shan’t consent to invite you,
until we can receive you in style. But I guess we shall be able to do
that, one of these days. I intend that Pamela shall live on Lake Bigler
until she can knock a bull down with her fist–say, about three
months.</p>
<p>“Tell everything as it is–no better, and no worse.“</p>
<p>Well, “Gold Hill“ sells at ,000 per foot, cash down; “Wild cat“ isn’t
worth ten cents. The country is fabulously rich in gold, silver, copper,
lead, coal, iron, quick silver, marble, granite, chalk, plaster of
Paris, (gypsum,) thieves, murderers, desperadoes, ladies, children,
lawyers, Christians, Indians, Chinamen, Spaniards, gamblers, sharpers,
coyotes (pronounced Ki-yo-ties,) poets, preachers, and jackass rabbits.
I overheard a gentleman say, the other day, that it was “the d—dest
country under the sun.“–and that comprehensive conception I fully
subscribe to. It never rains here, and the dew never falls. No flowers
grow here, and no green thing gladdens the eye. The birds that fly over
the land carry their provisions with them. Only the crow and the raven
tarry with us. Our city lies in the midst of a desert of the purest
–most unadulterated, and compromising sand–in which infernal soil
nothing but that fag-end of vegetable creation, “sage-brush,“ ventures
to grow. If you will take a Lilliputian cedar tree for a model, and
build a dozen imitations of it with the stiffest article of telegraph
wire–set them one foot apart and then try to walk through them, you’ll
understand (provided the floor is covered 12 inches deep with sand,)
what it is to wander through a sage-brush desert. When crushed, sage
brush emits an odor which isn’t exactly magnolia and equally isn’t
exactly polecat but is a sort of compromise between the two. It looks a
good deal like grease-wood, and is the ugliest plant that was ever
conceived of. It is gray in color. On the plains, sage-brush and
grease-wood grow about twice as large as the common geranium–and in my
opinion they are a very good substitute for that useless vegetable.
Grease-wood is a perfect –most perfect imitation in miniature of a live
oak tree-barring the color of it. As to the other fruits and flowers of
the country, there ain’t any, except “Pulu“ or “Tuler,“ or what ever
they call it,–a species of unpoetical willow that grows on the banks of
the Carson–a RIVER, 20 yards wide, knee deep, and so villainously rapid
and crooked, that it looks like it had wandered into the country without
intending it, and had run about in a bewildered way and got lost, in its
hurry to get out again before some thirsty man came along and drank it
up. I said we are situated in a flat, sandy desert–true. And surrounded
on all sides by such prodigious mountains, that when you gaze at them
awhile,–and begin to conceive of their grandeur–and next to feel their
vastness expanding your soul–and ultimately find yourself growing and
swelling and spreading into a giant–I say when this point is reached,
you look disdainfully down upon the insignificant village of Carson, and
in that instant you are seized with a burning desire to stretch forth
your hand, put the city in your pocket, and walk off with it.</p>
<p>As to churches, I believe they have got a Catholic one here, but like
that one the New York fireman spoke of, I believe “they don’t run her
now:“ Now, although we are surrounded by sand, the greatest part of the
town is built upon what was once a very pretty grassy spot; and the
streams of pure water that used to poke about it in rural sloth and
solitude, now pass through on dusty streets and gladden the hearts of
men by reminding them that there is at least something here that hath
its prototype among the homes they left behind them. And up “King’s
Canon,“ (please pronounce canyon, after the manner of the natives,)
there are “ranches,“ or farms, where they say hay grows, and grass, and
beets and onions, and turnips, and other “truck“ which is suitable for
cows–yes, and even Irish potatoes; also, cabbage, peas and beans.</p>
<p>The houses are mostly frame, unplastered, but “papered“ inside with
flour-sacks sewed together, and the handsomer the “brand“ upon the sacks
is, the neater the house looks. Occasionally, you stumble on a stone
house. On account of the dryness of the country, the shingles on the
houses warp till they look like short joints of stove pipe split
lengthwise.</p>
<p>(Remainder missing.)</p>
<p>In this letter is something of the “wild freedom of the West,“ which
later would contribute to his fame. The spirit of the frontier–of Mark
Twain–was beginning to stir him.</p>
<p>There had been no secretary work for him to do, and no provision for
payment. He found his profit in studying human nature and in prospecting
native resources. He was not interested in mining not yet. With a boy
named John Kinney he made an excursion to Lake Bigler–now Tahoe–and
located a timber claim, really of great value. They were supposed to
build a fence around it, but they were too full of the enjoyment of
camp-life to complete it. They put in most of their time wandering
through the stately forest or drifting over the transparent lake in a
boat left there by lumbermen. They built themselves a brush house, but
they did not sleep in it. In ‘Roughing It’ he writes, “It never occurred
to us, for one thing; and, besides, it was built to hold the ground, and
that was enough. We did not wish to strain it.“</p>
<p>They were having a glorious time, when their camp-fire got away from
them and burned up their claim. His next letter, of which the beginning
is missing, describes the fire.</p>
<p>Fragment of a letter to Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in
St. Louis:</p>
<p>…..The level ranks of flame were relieved at intervals by the
standard-bearers, as we called the tall dead trees, wrapped in fire, and
waving their blazing banners a hundred feet in the air. Then we could
turn from this scene to the Lake, and see every branch, and leaf, and
cataract of flame upon its bank perfectly reflected as in a gleaming,
fiery mirror. The mighty roaring of the conflagration, together with our
solitary and somewhat unsafe position (for there was no one within six
miles of us,) rendered the scene very impressive. Occasionally, one of
us would remove his pipe from his mouth and say, “Superb! magnificent!
Beautiful! but-by the Lord God Almighty, if we attempt to sleep in this
little patch tonight, we’ll never live till morning! for if we don’t
burn up, we’ll certainly suffocate.“ But he was persuaded to sit up
until we felt pretty safe as far as the fire was concerned, and then we
turned in, with many misgivings. When we got up in the morning, we found
that the fire had burned small pieces of drift wood within six feet of
our boat, and had made its way to within 4 or 5 steps of us on the South
side. We looked like lava men, covered as we were with ashes, and
begrimed with smoke. We were very black in the face, but we soon washed
ourselves white again.</p>
<p>John D. Kinney, a Cincinnati boy, and a first-rate fellow, too, who
came out with judge Turner, was my comrade. We staid at the Lake four
days –I had plenty of fun, for John constantly reminded me of Sam Bowen
when we were on our campaign in Missouri. But first and foremost, for
Annie’s, Mollies, and Pamela’s comfort, be it known that I have never
been guilty of profane language since I have been in this Territory, and
Kinney hardly ever swears.–But sometimes human nature gets the better of
him. On the second day we started to go by land to the lower camp, a
distance of three miles, over the mountains, each carrying an axe. I
don’t think we got lost exactly, but we wandered four hours over the
steepest, rockiest and most dangerous piece of country in the world. I
couldn’t keep from laughing at Kinney’s distress, so I kept behind, so
that he could not see me. After he would get over a dangerous place,
with infinite labor and constant apprehension, he would stop, lean on
his axe, and look around, then behind, then ahead, and then drop his
head and ruminate awhile.–Then he would draw a long sigh, and say:
“Well–could any Billygoat have scaled that place without breaking his —
—— neck?“ And I would reply, “No,–I don’t think he could.“ “No–you don’t
think he could–“ (mimicking me,) “Why don’t you curse the infernal
place? You know you want to.–I do, and will curse the — —— thieving
country as long as I live.“ Then we would toil on in silence for awhile.
Finally I told him–“Well, John, what if we don’t find our way out of
this today–we’ll know all about the country when we do get out.“ “Oh
stuff–I know enough–and too much about the d—d villainous locality
already.“ Finally, we reached the camp. But as we brought no provisions
with us, the first subject that presented itself to us was, how to get
back. John swore he wouldn’t walk back, so we rolled a drift log apiece
into the Lake, and set about making paddles, intending to straddle the
logs and paddle ourselves back home sometime or other. But the Lake
objected–got stormy, and we had to give it up. So we set out for the
only house on this side of the Lake–three miles from there, down the
shore. We found the way without any trouble, reached there before
sundown, played three games of cribbage, borrowed a dug-out and pulled
back six miles to the upper camp. As we had eaten nothing since sunrise,
we did not waste time in cooking our supper or in eating it, either.
After supper we got out our pipes–built a rousing camp fire in the open
air-established a faro bank (an institution of this country,) on our
huge flat granite dining table, and bet white beans till one o’clock,
when John went to bed. We were up before the sun the next morning, went
out on the Lake and caught a fine trout for breakfast. But
unfortunately, I spoilt part of the breakfast. We had coffee and tea
boiling on the fire, in coffee-pots and fearing they might not be strong
enough, I added more ground coffee, and more tea, but–you know mistakes
will happen.–I put the tea in the coffee-pot, and the coffee in the
teapot–and if you imagine that they were not villainous mixtures, just
try the effect once.</p>
<p>And so Bella is to be married on the 1st of Oct. Well, I send her and
her husband my very best wishes, and–I may not be here–but wherever I am
on that night, we’ll have a rousing camp-fire and a jollification in
honor of the event.</p>
<p>In a day or two we shall probably go to the Lake and build another
cabin and fence, and get everything into satisfactory trim before our
trip to Esmeralda about the first of November.</p>
<p>What has become of Sam Bowen? I would give my last shirt to have him
out here. I will make no promises, but I believe if John would give him
a thousand dollars and send him out here he would not regret it. He
might possibly do very well here, but he could do little without
capital.</p>
<p>Remember me to all my St. Louis and Keokuk friends, and tell Challie
and Hallie Renson that I heard a military band play “What are the Wild
Waves Saying?“ the other night, and it reminded me very forcibly of
them. It brought Ella Creel and Belle across the Desert too in an
instant, for they sang the song in Orion’s yard the first time I ever
heard it. It was like meeting an old friend. I tell you I could have
swallowed that whole band, trombone and all, if such a compliment would
have been any gratification to them. Love to the young folks, SAM.</p>
<p>The reference in the foregoing letter to Esmeralda has to do with
mining plans. He was beginning to be mildly interested, and, with his
brother Orion, had acquired “feet“ in an Esmeralda camp, probably at a
very small price–so small as to hold out no exciting prospect of riches.
In his next letter he gives us the size of this claim, which he has
visited. His interest, however, still appears to be chiefly in his
timber claim on Lake Bigler (Tahoe), though we are never to hear of it
again after this letter.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>CARSON CITY, Oct. 25, 1861. MY DEAR SISTER,–I have just finished
reading your letter and Ma’s of Sept. 8th. How in the world could they
have been so long coming? You ask me if I have for gotten my promise to
lay a claim for Mr. Moffett. By no means. I have already laid a timber
claim on the borders of a lake (Bigler) which throws Como in the
shade–and if we succeed in getting one Mr. Jones, to move his saw-mill
up there, Mr. Moffett can just consider that claim better than bank
stock. Jones says he will move his mill up next spring. In that claim I
took up about two miles in length by one in width–and the names in it
are as follows: “Sam. L Clemens, Wm. A. Moffett, Thos. Nye“ and three
others. It is situated on “Sam Clemens Bay“–so named by Capt. Nye–and it
goes by that name among the inhabitants of that region. I had better
stop about “the Lake,“ though, –for whenever I think of it I want to go
there and die, the place is so beautiful. I’ll build a country seat
there one of these days that will make the Devil’s mouth water if he
ever visits the earth. Jim Lampton will never know whether I laid a
claim there for him or not until he comes here himself. We have now got
about 1,650 feet of mining ground –and if it proves good, Mr. Moffett’s
name will go in–if not, I can get “feet“ for him in the Spring which
will be good. You see, Pamela, the trouble does not consist in getting
mining ground–for that is plenty enough–but the money to work it with
after you get it is the mischief. When I was in Esmeralda, a young
fellow gave me fifty feet in the “Black Warrior“–an unprospected claim.
The other day he wrote me that he had gone down eight feet on the ledge,
and found it eight feet thick–and pretty good rock, too. He said he
could take out rock now if there were a mill to crush it–but the mills
are all engaged (there are only four of them) so, if I were willing, he
would suspend work until Spring. I wrote him to let it alone at
present–because, you see, in the Spring I can go down myself and help
him look after it. There will then be twenty mills there. Orion and I
have confidence enough in this country to think that if the war will let
us alone we can make Mr. Moffett rich without its ever costing him a
cent of money or particle of trouble. We shall lay plenty of claims for
him, but if they never pay him anything, they will never cost him
anything, Orion and I are not financiers. Therefore, you must persuade
Uncle Jim to come out here and help us in that line. I have written to
him twice to come. I wrote him today. In both letters I told him not to
let you or Ma know that we dealt in such romantic nonsense as “brilliant
prospects,“ because I always did hate for anyone to know what my plans
or hopes or prospects were–for, if I kept people in ignorance in these
matters, no one could be disappointed but myself, if they were not
realized. You know I never told you that I went on the river under a
promise to pay Bixby 00, until I had paid the money and cleared my
skirts of the possibility of having my judgment criticised. I would not
say anything about our prospects now, if we were nearer home. But I
suppose at this distance you are more anxious than you would be if you
saw us every month-and therefore it is hardly fair to keep you in the
dark. However, keep these matters to yourselves, and then if we fail,
we’ll keep the laugh in the family.</p>
<p>What we want now is something that will commence paying immediately.
We have got a chance to get into a claim where they say a tunnel has
been run 150 feet, and the ledge struck. I got a horse yesterday, and
went out with the Attorney-General and the claim-owner–and we tried to
go to the claim by a new route, and got lost in the mountains–sunset
overtook us before we found the claim–my horse got too lame to carry me,
and I got down and drove him ahead of me till within four miles of
town–then we sent Rice on ahead. Bunker, (whose horse was in good
condition,) undertook, to lead mine, and I followed after him. Darkness
shut him out from my view in less than a minute, and within the next
minute I lost the road and got to wandering in the sage brush. I would
find the road occasionally and then lose it again in a minute or so. I
got to Carson about nine o’clock, at night, but not by the road I
traveled when I left it. The General says my horse did very well for
awhile, but soon refused to lead. Then he dismounted, and had a jolly
time driving both horses ahead of him and chasing them here and there
through the sage brush (it does my soul good when I think of it) until
he got to town, when both animals deserted him, and he cursed them
handsomely and came home alone. Of course the horses went to their
stables.</p>
<p>Tell Sammy I will lay a claim for him, and he must come out and
attend to it. He must get rid of that propensity for tumbling down,
though, for when we get fairly started here, I don’t think we shall have
time to pick up those who fall…..</p>
<p>That is Stoughter’s house, I expect, that Cousin Jim has moved into.
This is just the country for Cousin Jim to live in. I don’t believe it
would take him six months to make 00,000 here, if he had 3,000 dollars
to commence with. I suppose he can’t leave his family though.</p>
<p>Tell Mrs. Benson I never intend to be a lawyer. I have been a slave
several times in my life, but I’ll never be one again. I always intend
to be so situated (unless I marry,) that I can “pull up stakes“ and
clear out whenever I feel like it.</p>
<p>We are very thankful to you, Pamela, for the papers you send. We have
received half a dozen or more, and, next to letters, they are the most
welcome visitors we have. Write oftener, Pamela. Yr. Brother SAM.</p>
<p>The “Cousin Jim“ mentioned in this letter is the original of the
character of Colonel Sellers. Whatever Mark Twain’s later opinion of
Cousin Jim Lampton’s financial genius may have been, he seems to have
respected it at this time.</p>
<p>More than three months pass until we have another letter, and in that
time the mining fever had become well seated. Mark Twain himself was
full of the Sellers optimism, and it was bound to overflow, fortify as
he would against it.</p>
<p>He met with little enough encouragement. With three companions, in
midwinter, he made a mining excursion to the much exploited Humboldt
region, returning empty-handed after a month or two of hard experience.
This is the trip picturesquely described in Chapters XXVII to XXXIII of
Roughing It.–[It is set down historically in Mark Twain ‘A Biography.’
Harper andandandand brothers.]–He, mentions the Humboldt in his next
letter, but does not confess his failure.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>CARSON CITY, Feb. 8, 1862. MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–By George
Pamela, I begin to fear that I have invoked a Spirit of some kind or
other which I will find some difficulty in laying. I wasn’t much
terrified by your growing inclinations, but when you begin to call
presentiments to your aid, I confess that I “weaken.“ Mr. Moffett is
right, as I said before–and I am not much afraid of his going wrong. Men
are easily dealt with–but when you get the women started, you are in for
it, you know. But I have decided on two things, viz: Any of you, or all
of you, may live in California, for that is the Garden of Eden
reproduced–but you shall never live in Nevada; and secondly, none of
you, save Mr. Moffett, shall ever cross the Plains. If you were only
going to Pike’s Peak, a little matter of 700 miles from St. Jo, you
might take the coach, and I wouldn’t say a word. But I consider it over
2,000 miles from St. Jo to Carson, and the first 6 or 800 miles is mere
Fourth of July, compared to the balance of the route. But Lord bless
you, a man enjoys every foot of it. If you ever come here or to
California, it must be by sea. Mr. Moffett must come by overland coach,
though, by all means. He would consider it the jolliest little trip he
ever took in his life. Either June, July, or August are the proper
months to make the journey in. He could not suffer from heat, and three
or four heavy army blankets would make the cold nights comfortable. If
the coach were full of passengers, two good blankets would probably be
sufficient. If he comes, and brings plenty of money, and fails to invest
it to his entire satisfaction; I will prophesy no more.</p>
<p>But I will tell you a few things which you wouldn’t have found out if
I hadn’t got myself into this scrape. I expect to return to St. Louis in
July–per steamer. I don’t say that I will return then, or that I shall
be able to do it–but I expect to–you bet. I came down here from
Humboldt, in order to look after our Esmeralda interests, and my
sore-backed horse and the bad roads have prevented me from making the
journey. Yesterday one of my old Esmeralda friends, Bob Howland, arrived
here, and I have had a talk with him. He owns with me in the “Horatio
and Derby“ ledge. He says our tunnel is in 52 feet, and a small stream
of water has been struck, which bids fair to become a “big thing“ by the
time the ledge is reached–sufficient to supply a mill. Now, if you knew
anything of the value of water, here; you would perceive, at a glance
that if the water should amount to 50 or 100 inches, we wouldn’t care
whether school kept or not. If the ledge should prove to be worthless,
we’d sell the water for money enough to give us quite a lift. But you
see, the ledge will not prove to be worthless. We have located, near by,
a fine site for a mill; and when we strike the ledge, you know, we’ll
have a mill-site, water power, and pay-rock, all handy. Then we shan’t
care whether we have capital or not. Mill-folks will build us a mill,
and wait for their pay. If nothing goes wrong, we’ll strike the ledge in
June–and if we do, I’ll be home in July, you know.</p>
<p>Pamela, don’t you know that undemonstrated human calculations won’t
do to bet on? Don’t you know that I have only talked, as yet, but proved
nothing? Don’t you know that I have expended money in this country but
have made none myself? Don’t you know that I have never held in my hands
a gold or silver bar that belonged to me? Don’t you know that it’s all
talk and no cider so far? Don’t you know that people who always feel
jolly, no matter where they are or what happens to them–who have the
organ of hope preposterously developed–who are endowed with an
uncongealable sanguine temperament–who never feel concerned about the
price of corn–and who cannot, by any possibility, discover any but the
bright side of a picture–are very apt to go to extremes, and exaggerate
with 40-horse microscopic power? Of course I never tried to raise these
suspicions in your mind, but then your knowledge of the fact that some
people’s poor frail human nature is a sort of crazy institution anyhow,
ought to have suggested them to you. Now, if I hadn’t thoughtlessly got
you into the notion of coming out here, and thereby got myself into a
scrape, I wouldn’t have given you that highly-colored paragraph about
the mill, etc., because, you know, if that pretty little picture should
fail, and wash out, and go the Devil generally, it wouldn’t cost me the
loss of an hour’s sleep, but you fellows would be so much distressed on
my account as I could possibly be if “circumstances beyond my control“
were to prevent my being present at my own funeral. But–but–</p>
<p>“In the bright lexicon of youth, There’s no such word as Fail–“ and
I’ll prove it!</p>
<p>And look here. I came near forgetting it. Don’t you say a word to me
about “trains“ across the plains. Because I am down on that arrangement.
That sort of thing is “played out,“ you know. The Overland Coach or the
Mail Steamer is the thing.</p>
<p>You want to know something about the route between California and
Nevada Territory? Suppose you take my word for it, that it is
exceedingly jolly. Or take, for a winter view, J. Ross Brown’s picture,
in Harper’s Monthly, of pack mules tumbling fifteen hundred feet down
the side of a mountain. Why bless you, there’s scenery on that route.
You can stand on some of those noble peaks and see Jerusalem and the
Holy Land. And you can start a boulder, and send it tearing up the earth
and crashing over trees-down-down-down-to the very devil, Madam. And you
would probably stand up there and look, and stare and wonder at the
magnificence spread out before you till you starved to death, if let
alone. But you should take someone along to keep you moving.</p>
<p>Since you want to know, I will inform you that an eight-stamp water
mill, put up and ready for business would cost about 0,000 to 2,000.
Then, the water to run it with would cost from ,000 to 0,000–and even
more, according to the location. What I mean by that, is, that water
powers in THIS vicinity, are immensely valuable. So, also, in Esmeralda.
But Humboldt is a new country, and things don’t cost so much there yet.
I saw a good water power sold there for 50.00. But here is the way the
thing is managed. A man with a good water power on Carson river will
lean his axe up against a tree (provided you find him chopping cord-wood
at a day,) and taking his chalk pipe out of his mouth to afford him an
opportunity to answer your questions, will look you coolly in the face
and tell you his little property is worth forty or fifty thousand
dollars! But you can easily fix him. You tell him that you’ll build a
quartz mill on his property, and make him a fourth or a third, or half
owner in said mill in consideration of the privilege of using said
property–and that will bring him to his milk in a jiffy. So he spits on
his hands, and goes in again with his axe, until the mill is finished,
when lo! out pops the quondam wood-chopper, arrayed in purple and fine
linen, and prepared to deal in bank-stock, or bet on the races, or take
government loans, with an air, as to the amount, of the most don’t care
a-d—dest unconcern that you can conceive of. By George, if I just had a
thousand dollars–I’d be all right! Now there’s the “Horatio,“ for
instance. There are five or six shareholders in it, and I know I could
buy half of their interests at, say 0 per foot, now that flour is worth
0 per barrel and they are pressed for money. But I am hard up myself,
and can’t buy–and in June they’ll strike the ledge and then “good-bye
canary.“ I can’t get it for love or money. Twenty dollars a foot! Think
of it. For ground that is proven to be rich. Twenty dollars, Madam–and
we wouldn’t part with a foot of our 75 for five times the sum. So it
will be in Humboldt next summer. The boys will get pushed and sell
ground for a song that is worth a fortune. But I am at the helm, now. I
have convinced Orion that he hasn’t business talent enough to carry on a
peanut stand, and he has solemnly promised me that he will meddle no
more with mining, or other matters not connected with the Secretary’s
office. So, you see, if mines are to be bought or sold, or tunnels run,
or shafts sunk, parties have to come to me–and me only. I’m the “firm,“
you know.</p>
<p>“How long does it take one of those infernal trains to go through?“
Well, anywhere between three and five months.</p>
<p>Tell Margaret that if you ever come to live in California, that you
can promise her a home for a hundred years, and a bully one–but she
wouldn’t like the country. Some people are malicious enough to think
that if the devil were set at liberty and told to confine himself to
Nevada Territory, that he would come here–and look sadly around, awhile,
and then get homesick and go back to hell again. But I hardly believe
it, you know. I am saying, mind you, that Margaret wouldn’t like the
country, perhaps–nor the devil either, for that matter, or any other man
but I like it. When it rains here, it never lets up till it has done all
the raining it has got to do–and after that, there’s a dry spell, you
bet. Why, I have had my whiskers and moustaches so full of alkali dust
that you’d have thought I worked in a starch factory and boarded in a
flour barrel.</p>
<p>Since we have been here there has not been a fire–although the houses
are built of wood. They “holler“ fire sometimes, though, but I am always
too late to see the smoke before the fire is out, if they ever have any.
Now they raised a yell here in front of the office a moment ago. I put
away my papers, and locked up everything of value, and changed my boots,
and pulled off my coat, and went and got a bucket of water, and came
back to see what the matter was, remarking to myself, “I guess I’ll be
on hand this time, any way.“ But I met a friend on the pavement, and he
said, “Where you been? Fire’s out half an hour ago.“</p>
<p>Ma says Axtele was above “suspition“–but I have searched through
Webster’s Unabridged, and can’t find the word. However, it’s of no
consequence–I hope he got down safely. I knew Axtele and his wife as
well as I know Dan Haines. Mrs. A. once tried to embarrass me in the
presence of company by asking me to name her baby, when she was well
aware that I didn’t know the sex of that Phenomenon. But I told her to
call it Frances, and spell it to suit herself. That was about nine years
ago, and Axtele had no property, and could hardly support his family by
his earnings. He was a pious cuss, though. Member of Margaret Sexton’s
Church.</p>
<p>And Ma says “it looks like a man can’t hold public office and be
honest.“ Why, certainly not, Madam. A man can’t hold public office and
be honest. Lord bless you, it is a common practice with Orion to go
about town stealing little things that happen to be lying around loose.
And I don’t remember having heard him speak the truth since we have been
in Nevada. He even tries to prevail upon me to do these things, Ma, but
I wasn’t brought up in that way, you know. You showed the public what
you could do in that line when you raised me, Madam. But then you ought
to have raised me first, so that Orion could have had the benefit of my
example. Do you know that he stole all the stamps out of an 8 stamp
quartz mill one night, and brought them home under his over-coat and hid
them in the back room? Yrs. etc., SAM</p>
<p>A little later he had headed for the Esmeralda Hills. Some time in
February he was established there in a camp with a young man by the name
of Horatio Phillips (Raish). Later he camped with Bob Howland, who, as
City Marshal of Aurora, became known as the most fearless man in the
Territory, and, still later, with Calvin H. Higbie (Cal), to whom
‘Roughing It’ would one day be dedicated. His own funds were exhausted
by this time, and Orion, with his rather slender salary, became the
financial partner of the firm.</p>
<p>It was a comfortless life there in the Esmeralda camp. Snow covered
everything. There was nothing to do, and apparently nothing to report;
for there are no letters until April. Then the first one is dated Carson
City, where he seems to be making a brief sojourn. It is a rather heavy
attempt to be light-hearted; its playfulness suggests that of a dancing
bear.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>CARSON CITY, April 2, 1862. MY DEAR MOTHER,–Yours of March 2nd has
just been received. I see I am in for it again–with Annie. But she ought
to know that I was always stupid. She used to try to teach me lessons
from the Bible, but I never could understand them. Doesn’t she remember
telling me the story of Moses, one Sunday, last Spring, and how hard she
tried to explain it and simplify it so that I could understand it–but I
couldn’t? And how she said it was strange that while her ma and her
grandma and her uncle Orion could understand anything in the world, I
was so dull that I couldn’t understand the “ea-siest thing?“ And doesn’t
she remember that finally a light broke in upon me and I said it was all
right–that I knew old Moses himself–and that he kept a clothing store in
Market Street? And then she went to her ma and said she didn’t know what
would become of her uncle Sam he was too dull to learn anything–ever!
And I’m just as dull yet. Now I have no doubt her letter was spelled
right, and was correct in all particulars–but then I had to read it
according to my lights; and they being inferior, she ought to overlook
the mistakes I make specially, as it is not my fault that I wasn’t born
with good sense. I am sure she will detect an encouraging ray of
intelligence in that last argument…..</p>
<p>I am waiting here, trying to rent a better office for Orion. I have
got the refusal after next week of a room on first floor of a fire-proof
brick-rent, eighteen hundred dollars a year. Don’t know yet whether we
can get it or not. If it is not rented before the week is up, we
can.</p>
<p>I was sorry to hear that Dick was killed. I gave him his first lesson
in the musket drill. We had half a dozen muskets in our office when it
was over Isbell’s Music Rooms.</p>
<p>I hope I am wearing the last white shirt that will embellish my
person for many a day–for I do hope that I shall be out of Carson long
before this reaches you. Love to all. Very Respectfully SAM.</p>
<p>The “Annie“ in this letter was his sister Pamela’s little daughter;
long years after, she would be the wife of Charles L. Webster, Mark
Twain’s publishing partner. “Dick“ the reader may remember as Dick
Hingham, of the Keokuk printing-office; he was killed in charging the
works at Fort Donelson.</p>
<p>Clemens was back in Esmeralda when the next letter was written, and
we begin now to get pictures of that cheerless mining-camp, and to know
something of the alternate hopes and discouragements of the hunt for
gold–the miner one day soaring on wings of hope, on the next becoming
excited, irritable, profane. The names of new mines appear constantly
and vanish almost at a touch, suggesting the fairy-like evanescence of
their riches.</p>
<p>But a few of the letters here will best speak for themselves; not all
of them are needed. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that there is no
intentional humor in these documents.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in Carson City:</p>
<p>ESMERALDA, 13th April, 1862. MY DEAR BROTHER,–Wasson got here night
before last “from the wars.“ Tell Lockhart he is not wounded and not
killed–is altogether unhurt. He says the whites left their stone fort
before he and Lieut. Noble got there. A large amount of provisions and
ammunition, which they left behind them, fell into the hands of the
Indians. They had a pitched battle with the savages some fifty miles
from the fort, in which Scott (sheriff) and another man was killed. This
was the day before the soldiers came up with them. I mean Noble’s men,
and those under Cols. Evans and Mayfield, from Los Angeles. Evans
assumed the chief command –and next morning the forces were divided into
three parties, and marched against the enemy. Col. Mayfield was killed,
and Sergeant Gillespie, also Noble’s colonel was wounded. The California
troops went back home, and Noble remained, to help drive the stock over
here. And, as Cousin Sally Dillard says, this is all I know about the
fight.</p>
<p>Work not yet begun on the H. and Derby–haven’t seen it yet. It is
still in the snow. Shall begin on it within 3 or 4 weeks–strike the
ledge in July. Guess it is good–worth from 0 to 0 a foot in
California.</p>
<p>Why didn’t you send the “Live Yankee“ deed-the very one I wanted?
Have made no inquiries about it, much. Don’t intend to until I get the
deed. Send it along–by mail–d—n the Express–have to pay three times for
all express matter; once in Carson and twice here. I don’t expect to
take the saddle-bags out of the express office. I paid twenty-five cts.
for the Express deeds.</p>
<p>Man named Gebhart shot here yesterday while trying to defend a claim
on Last Chance Hill. Expect he will die.</p>
<p>These mills here are not worth a d—n-except Clayton’s–and it is not
in full working trim yet.</p>
<p>Send me 0 or 0–by mail–immediately.</p>
<p>The Red Bird is probably good–can’t work on the tunnel on account of
snow. The “Pugh“ I have thrown away–shan’t re-locate it. It is nothing
but bed-rock croppings–too much work to find the ledge, if there is one.
Shan’t record the “Farnum“ until I know more about it–perhaps not at
all.</p>
<p>“Governor“ under the snow.</p>
<p>“Douglas“ and “Red Bird“ are both recorded.</p>
<p>I have had opportunities to get into several ledges, but refused all
but three–expect to back out of two of them.</p>
<p>Stir yourself as much as possible, and lay up 00 or 5,000, subject to
my call. I go to work to-morrow, with pick and shovel. Something’s got
to come, by G–, before I let go, here.</p>
<p>Col. Youngs says you must rent Kinkead’s room by all means–Government
would rather pay 50 a month for your office than 5 for Gen. North’s.
Says you are playing your hand very badly, for either the Government’s
good opinion or anybody’s else, in keeping your office in a shanty. Says
put Gov. Nye in your place and he would have a stylish office, and no
objections would ever be made, either. When old Col. Youngs talks this
way, I think it time to get a fine office. I wish you would take that
office, and fit it up handsomely, so that I can omit telling people that
by this time you are handsomely located, when I know it is no such
thing.</p>
<p>I am living with “Ratio Phillips.“ Send him one of those black
portfolios–by the stage, and put a couple of pen-holders and a dozen
steel pens in it.</p>
<p>If you should have occasion to dispose of the long desk before I
return, don’t forget to break open the middle drawer and take out my
things. Envelop my black cloth coat in a newspaper and hang it in the
back room.</p>
<p>Don’t buy anything while I am here–but save up some money for me.
Don’t send any money home. I shall have your next quarter’s salary spent
before you get it, I think. I mean to make or break here within the next
two or three months. Yrs. SAM</p>
<p>The “wars“ mentioned in the opening paragraph of this letter were
incident to the trouble concerning the boundary line between California
and Nevada. The trouble continued for some time, with occasional
bloodshed. The next letter is an exultant one. There were few enough of
this sort. We cannot pretend to keep track of the multiplicity of mines
and shares which lure the gold-hunters, pecking away at the flinty
ledges, usually in the snow. It has been necessary to abbreviate this
letter, for much of it has lost all importance with the years, and is
merely confusing. Hope is still high in the writer’s heart, and
confidence in his associates still unshaken. Later he was to lose faith
in “Raish,“ whether with justice or not we cannot know now.</p>
<p>To Orion Clowns, in Carson City:</p>
<p>ESMERALDA, May 11, 1862. MY DEAR BRO.,–TO use a French expression I
have “got my d–d satisfy“ at last. Two years’ time will make us
capitalists, in spite of anything. Therefore, we need fret and fume, and
worry and doubt no more, but just lie still and put up with privations
for six months. Perhaps three months will “let us out.“ Then, if
Government refuses to pay the rent on your new office we can do it
ourselves. We have got to wait six weeks, anyhow, for a dividend, maybe
longer–but that it will come there is no shadow of a doubt, I have got
the thing sifted down to a dead moral certainty. I own one-eighth of the
new “Monitor Ledge, Clemens Company,“ and money can’t buy a foot of it;
because I know it to contain our fortune. The ledge is six feet wide,
and one needs no glass to see gold and silver in it. Phillips and I own
one half of a segregated claim in the “Flyaway“ discovery, and good
interests in two extensions on it. We put men to work on our part of the
discovery yesterday, and last night they brought us some fine specimens.
Rock taken from ten feet below the surface on the other part of the
discovery, has yielded 50.00 to the ton in the mill and we are at work
300 feet from their shaft.</p>
<p>May 12–Yours by the mail received last night. “Eighteen hundred feet
in the C. T. Rice’s Company!“ Well, I am glad you did not accept of the
200 feet. Tell Rice to give it to some poor man.</p>
<p>But hereafter, when anybody holds up a glittering prospect before
you, just argue in this wise, viz: That, if all spare change be devoted
to working the “Monitor“ and “Flyaway,“ 12 months, or 24 at furthest,
will find all our earthly wishes satisfied, so far as money is
concerned–and the more “feet“ we have, the more anxiety we must
bear–therefore, why not say “No–d—n your ‘prospects,’ I wait on a sure
thing–and a man is less than a man, if he can’t wait 2 years for a
fortune?“ When you and I came out here, we did not expect ’63 or ’64 to
find us rich men –and if that proposition had been made, we would have
accepted it gladly. Now, it is made.</p>
<p>Well, I am willing, now, that “Neary’s tunnel,“ or anybody else’s
tunnel shall succeed. Some of them may beat us a few months, but we
shall be on hand in the fullness of time, as sure as fate. I would hate
to swap chances with any member of the “tribe“–in fact, I am so lost to
all sense and reason as to be capable of refusing to trade “Flyaway“
(with but 200 feet in the Company of four,) foot for foot for that
splendid “Lady Washington,“ with its lists of capitalist proprietors,
and its 35,000 feet of Priceless ground.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t mind being in some of those Clear Creek claims, if I lived
in Carson and we could spare the money. But I have struck my tent in
Esmeralda, and I care for no mines but those which I can superintend
myself. I am a citizen here now, and I am satisfied–although R. and I
are strapped and we haven’t three days’ rations in the house.</p>
<p>Raish is looking anxiously for money and so am I. Send me whatever
you can spare conveniently–I want it to work the Flyaway with. My fourth
of that claim only cost me 0, (which isn’t paid yet, though,) and I
suppose I could sell it here in town for ten times that amount today,
but I shall probably hold onto it till the cows come home. I shall work
the “Monitor“ and the other claims with my own hands. I prospected of a
pound of “M,“ yesterday, and Raish reduced it with the blow-pipe, and
got about ten or twelve cents in gold and silver, besides the other half
of it which we spilt on the floor and didn’t get. The specimen came from
the croppings, but was a choice one, and showed much free gold to the
naked eye.</p>
<p>Well, I like the corner up-stairs office amazingly–provided, it has
one fine, large front room superbly carpeted, for the safe and a 50
desk, or such a matter–one handsome room amidships, less handsomely
gotten up, perhaps, for records and consultations, and one good-sized
bedroom and adjoining it a kitchen, neither of which latter can be
entered by anybody but yourself–and finally, when one of the ledges
begins to pay, the whole to be kept in parlor order by two likely
contrabands at big wages, the same to be free of expense to the
Government. You want the entire second story–no less room than you would
have had in Harris and Co’s. Make them fix for you before the 1st of
July-for maybe you might want to “come out strong“ on the 4th, you
know.</p>
<p>No, the Post Office is all right and kept by a gentleman but W. F.
Express isn’t. They charge 25 cts to express a letter from here, but I
believe they have quit charging twice for letters that arrive
prepaid.</p>
<p>The “Flyaway“ specimen I sent you, (taken by myself from DeKay’s
shaft, 300 feet from where we are going to sink) cannot be called
“choice,“ exactly–say something above medium, to be on the safe side.
But I have seen exceedingly choice chunks from that shaft. My intention
at first in sending the Antelope specimen was that you might see that it
resembles the Monitor–but, come to think, a man can tell absolutely
nothing about that without seeing both ledges themselves. I tried to
break a handsome chunk from a huge piece of my darling Monitor which we
brought from the croppings yesterday, but it all splintered up, and I
send you the scraps. I call that “choice“–any d—d fool would. Don’t ask
if it has been assayed, for it hasn’t. It don’t need it. It is amply
able to speak for itself. It is six feet wide on top, and traversed
through and through with veins whose color proclaims their worth. What
the devil does a man want with any more feet when he owns in the Flyaway
and the invincible bomb-proof Monitor?</p>
<p>If I had anything more to say I have forgotten what it was, unless,
perhaps, that I want a sum of money–anywhere from 0 to 50, as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>Raish sends regards. He or I, one will drop a line to the “Age“
occasionally. I suppose you saw my letters in the “Enterprise.“ Yr. BRO,
SAM</p>
<p>P. S. I suppose Pamela never will regain her health, but she could
improve it by coming to California–provided the trip didn’t kill
her.</p>
<p>You see Bixby is on the flag-ship. He always was the best pilot on
the Mississippi, and deserves his “posish.“ They have done a reckless
thing, though, in putting Sam Bowen on the “Swan“–for if a bomb-shell
happens to come his way, he will infallibly jump overboard.</p>
<p>Send me another package of those envelopes, per Bagley’s coat
pocket.</p>
<p>We see how anxious he was for his brother to make a good official
showing. If a niggardly Government refused to provide decent quarters–no
matter; the miners, with gold pouring in, would themselves pay for a
suite “superbly carpeted,“ and all kept in order by “two likely
contrabands“–that is to say, negroes. Samuel Clemens in those days
believed in expansion and impressive surroundings. His brother, though
also mining mad, was rather inclined to be penny wise in the matter of
office luxury–not a bad idea, as it turned out.</p>
<p>Orion, by the way, was acquiring “feet“ on his own account, and in
one instance, at least, seems to have won his brother’s
commendation.</p>
<p>The ‘Enterprise’ letters mentioned we shall presently hear of
again.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in Carson City:</p>
<p>ESMERALDA, Sunday, May–, 1862. MY DEAR BROTHER,–Well, if you haven’t
“struck it rich–“ that is, if the piece of rock you sent me came from a
bona fide ledge–and it looks as if it did. If that is a ledge, and you
own 200 feet in it, why, it’s a big thing–and I have nothing more to
say. If you have actually made something by helping to pay somebody’s
prospecting expenses it is a wonder of the first magnitude, and deserves
to rank as such.</p>
<p>If that rock came from a well-defined ledge, that particular vein
must be at least an inch wide, judging from this specimen, which is
fully that thick.</p>
<p>When I came in the other evening, hungry and tired and ill-natured,
and threw down my pick and shovel, Raish gave me your specimen–said
Bagley brought it, and asked me if it were cinnabar. I examined it by
the waning daylight, and took the specks of fine gold for
sulphurets–wrote you I did not think much of it–and posted the letter
immediately.</p>
<p>But as soon as I looked at it in the broad light of day, I saw my
mistake. During the week, we have made three horns, got a blow-pipe,
andandandandc, and yesterday, all prepared, we prospected the “Mountain
House.“ I broke the specimen in two, and found it full of fine gold
inside. Then we washed out one-fourth of it, and got a noble prospect.
This we reduced with the blow-pipe, and got about two cents (herewith
enclosed) in pure gold.</p>
<p>As the fragment prospected weighed rather less than an ounce, this
would give about 00 to the ton. We were eminently well satisfied.
Therefore, hold on to the “Mountain House,“ for it is a “big thing.“
Touch it lightly, as far as money is concerned, though, for it is well
to reserve the code of justice in the matter of quartz ledges–that is,
consider them all (and their owners) guilty (of “shenanigan“) until they
are proved innocent.</p>
<p>P. S.–Monday–Ratio and I have bought one-half of a segregated claim
in the original “Flyaway,“ for 00–0 down. We haven’t a cent in the
house. We two will work the ledge, and have full control, and pay all
expenses. If you can spare 00 conveniently, let me have it–or 0, anyhow,
considering that I own one fourth of this, it is of course more valuable
than one 1/7 of the “Mountain House,“ although not so rich ….</p>
<p>There is too much of a sameness in the letters of this period to use
all of them. There are always new claims, and work done, apparently
without system or continuance, hoping to uncover sudden boundless
affluence.</p>
<p>In the next letter and the one following it we get a hint of an
episode, or rather of two incidents which he combined into an episode in
Roughing It. The story as told in that book is an account of what might
have happened, rather than history. There was never really any money in
the “blind lead“ of the Wide West claim, except that which was sunk in
it by unfortunate investors. Only extracts from these letters are given.
The other portions are irrelevant and of slight value.</p>
<p>Extract from a letter to Orion Clemens, in Carson City:</p>
<ol start="1862" type="1">
<li>Two or three of the old “Salina“ company entered our hole on the
Monitor yesterday morning, before our men got there, and took
possession, armed with revolvers. And according to the d—d laws of this
forever d—d country, nothing but the District Court (and there ain’t
any) can touch the matter, unless it assumes the shape of an infernal
humbug which they call “forcible entry and detainer,“ and in order to
bring that about, you must compel the jumpers to use personal violence
toward you! We went up and demanded possession, and they refused. Said
they were in the hole, armed and meant to die for it, if necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>I got in with them, and again demanded possession. They said I might
stay in it as long as I pleased, and work but they would do the same. I
asked one of our company to take my place in the hole, while I went to
consult a lawyer. He did so. The lawyer said it was no go. They must
offer some “force.“</p>
<p>Our boys will try to be there first in the morning–in which case they
may get possession and keep it. Now you understand the shooting scrape
in which Gebhart was killed the other day. The Clemens Company–all of
us–hate to resort to arms in this matter, and it will not be done until
it becomes a forced hand–but I think that will be the end of it,
never-the-less.</p>
<p>The mine relocated in this letter was not the “Wide West,“ but it
furnished the proper incident. The only mention of the “Wide West“ is
found in a letter written in July.</p>
<p>Extract from a letter to Orion Clemens, in Carson City: 1862 If I do
not forget it, I will send you, per next mail, a pinch of decom.
(decomposed rock) which I pinched with thumb and finger from “Wide West“
ledge awhile ago. Raish and I have secured 200 out of a 400 ft. in it,
which perhaps (the ledge, I mean) is a spur from the W. W.–our shaft is
about 100 ft. from the W. W. shaft. In order to get in, we agreed to
sink 30 ft. We have sub-let to another man for 50 ft., and we pay for
powder and sharpening tools.</p>
<p>The “Wide West“ claim was forfeited, but there is no evidence to show
that Clemens and his partners were ever, except in fiction,
“millionaires for ten days.“ The background, the local color, and the
possibilities are all real enough, but Mark Twain’s aim in this, as in
most of his other reminiscent writing, was to arrange and adapt his
facts to the needs of a good story.</p>
<p>The letters of this summer (1862) most of them bear evidence of
waning confidence in mining as a source of fortune–the miner has now
little faith in his own judgment, and none at all in that of his
brother, who was without practical experience.</p>
