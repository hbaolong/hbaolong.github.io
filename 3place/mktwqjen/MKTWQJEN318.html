<h4 id="chapter-xviii-the-kindly-courtesy-of-germans">Chapter XVIII [The
Kindly Courtesy of Germans]</h4>
<p>In the morning we took breakfast in the garden, under the trees, in
the delightful German summer fashion. The air was filled with the
fragrance of flowers and wild animals; the living portion of the
menagerie of the “Naturalist Tavern“ was all about us. There were great
cages populous with fluttering and chattering foreign birds, and other
great cages and greater wire pens, populous with quadrupeds, both native
and foreign. There were some free creatures, too, and quite sociable
ones they were. White rabbits went loping about the place, and
occasionally came and sniffed at our shoes and shins; a fawn, with a red
ribbon on its neck, walked up and examined us fearlessly; rare breeds of
chickens and doves begged for crumbs, and a poor old tailless raven
hopped about with a humble, shamefaced mein which said, “Please do not
notice my exposure–think how you would feel in my circumstances, and be
charitable.“ If he was observed too much, he would retire behind
something and stay there until he judged the party’s interest had found
another object. I never have seen another dumb creature that was so
morbidly sensitive. Bayard Taylor, who could interpret the dim
reasonings of animals, and understood their moral natures better than
most men, would have found some way to make this poor old chap forget
his troubles for a while, but we have not his kindly art, and so had to
leave the raven to his griefs.</p>
<p>After breakfast we climbed the hill and visited the ancient castle of
Hirschhorn, and the ruined church near it. There were some curious old
bas-reliefs leaning against the inner walls of the church–sculptured
lords of Hirschhorn in complete armor, and ladies of Hirschhorn in the
picturesque court costumes of the Middle Ages. These things are
suffering damage and passing to decay, for the last Hirschhorn has been
dead two hundred years, and there is nobody now who cares to preserve
the family relics. In the chancel was a twisted stone column, and the
captain told us a legend about it, of course, for in the matter of
legends he could not seem to restrain himself; but I do not repeat his
tale because there was nothing plausible about it except that the Hero
wrenched this column into its present screw-shape with his hands –just
one single wrench. All the rest of the legend was doubtful.</p>
<p>But Hirschhorn is best seen from a distance, down the river. Then the
clustered brown towers perched on the green hilltop, and the old
battlemented stone wall, stretching up and over the grassy ridge and
disappearing in the leafy sea beyond, make a picture whose grace and
beauty entirely satisfy the eye.</p>
<p>We descended from the church by steep stone stairways which curved
this way and that down narrow alleys between the packed and dirty
tenements of the village. It was a quarter well stocked with deformed,
leering, unkempt and uncombed idiots, who held out hands or caps and
begged piteously. The people of the quarter were not all idiots, of
course, but all that begged seemed to be, and were said to be.</p>
<p>I was thinking of going by skiff to the next town, Necharsteinach; so
I ran to the riverside in advance of the party and asked a man there if
he had a boat to hire. I suppose I must have spoken High German–Court
German–I intended it for that, anyway–so he did not understand me. I
turned and twisted my question around and about, trying to strike that
man’s average, but failed. He could not make out what I wanted. Now
Mr. X arrived, faced this same man, looked him in the eye, and emptied
this sentence on him, in the most glib and confident way: “Can man boat
get here?“</p>
<p>The mariner promptly understood and promptly answered. I can
comprehend why he was able to understand that particular sentence,
because by mere accident all the words in it except “get“ have the same
sound and the same meaning in German that they have in English; but how
he managed to understand Mr. X’s next remark puzzled me. I will insert
it, presently. X turned away a moment, and I asked the mariner if he
could not find a board, and so construct an additional seat. I spoke in
the purest German, but I might as well have spoken in the purest Choctaw
for all the good it did. The man tried his best to understand me; he
tried, and kept on trying, harder and harder, until I saw it was really
of no use, and said:</p>
<p>“There, don’t strain yourself–it is of no consequence.“</p>
<p>Then X turned to him and crisply said:</p>
<p>“MACHEN SIE a flat board.“</p>
<p>I wish my epitaph may tell the truth about me if the man did not
answer up at once, and say he would go and borrow a board as soon as he
had lit the pipe which he was filling.</p>
<p>We changed our mind about taking a boat, so we did not have to go. I
have given Mr. X’s two remarks just as he made them. Four of the five
words in the first one were English, and that they were also German was
only accidental, not intentional; three out of the five words in the
second remark were English, and English only, and the two German ones
did not mean anything in particular, in such a connection.</p>
<p>X always spoke English to Germans, but his plan was to turn the
sentence wrong end first and upside down, according to German
construction, and sprinkle in a German word without any essential
meaning to it, here and there, by way of flavor. Yet he always made
himself understood. He could make those dialect-speaking raftsmen
understand him, sometimes, when even young Z had failed with them; and
young Z was a pretty good German scholar. For one thing, X always spoke
with such confidence–perhaps that helped. And possibly the raftsmen’s
dialect was what is called PLATT-DEUTSCH, and so they found his English
more familiar to their ears than another man’s German. Quite indifferent
students of German can read Fritz Reuter’s charming platt-Deutch tales
with some little facility because many of the words are English. I
suppose this is the tongue which our Saxon ancestors carried to England
with them. By and by I will inquire of some other philologist.</p>
<p>However, in the mean time it had transpired that the men employed to
calk the raft had found that the leak was not a leak at all, but only a
crack between the logs–a crack that belonged there, and was not
dangerous, but had been magnified into a leak by the disordered
imagination of the mate. Therefore we went aboard again with a good
degree of confidence, and presently got to sea without accident. As we
swam smoothly along between the enchanting shores, we fell to swapping
notes about manners and customs in Germany and elsewhere.</p>
<p>As I write, now, many months later, I perceive that each of us, by
observing and noting and inquiring, diligently and day by day, had
managed to lay in a most varied and opulent stock of misinformation. But
this is not surprising; it is very difficult to get accurate details in
any country. For example, I had the idea once, in Heidelberg, to find
out all about those five student-corps. I started with the White Cap
corps. I began to inquire of this and that and the other citizen, and
here is what I found out:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is called the Prussian Corps, because none but Prussians are
admitted to it.</p></li>
<li><p>It is called the Prussian Corps for no particular reason. It has
simply pleased each corps to name itself after some German
state.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not named the Prussian Corps at all, but only the White Cap
Corps.</p></li>
<li><p>Any student can belong to it who is a German by birth.</p></li>
<li><p>Any student can belong to it who is European by birth.</p></li>
<li><p>Any European-born student can belong to it, except he be a
Frenchman.</p></li>
<li><p>Any student can belong to it, no matter where he was
born.</p></li>
<li><p>No student can belong to it who is not of noble blood.</p></li>
<li><p>No student can belong to it who cannot show three full
generations of noble descent.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobility is not a necessary qualification.</p></li>
<li><p>No moneyless student can belong to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Money qualification is nonsense–such a thing has never been
thought of.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I got some of this information from students themselves –students who
did not belong to the corps.</p>
<p>I finally went to headquarters–to the White Caps–where I would have
gone in the first place if I had been acquainted. But even at
headquarters I found difficulties; I perceived that there were things
about the White Cap Corps which one member knew and another one didn’t.
It was natural; for very few members of any organization know ALL that
can be known about it. I doubt there is a man or a woman in Heidelberg
who would not answer promptly and confidently three out of every five
questions about the White Cap Corps which a stranger might ask; yet it
is a very safe bet that two of the three answers would be incorrect
every time.</p>
<p>There is one German custom which is universal–the bowing courteously
to strangers when sitting down at table or rising up from it. This bow
startles a stranger out of his self-possession, the first time it
occurs, and he is likely to fall over a chair or something, in his
embarrassment, but it pleases him, nevertheless. One soon learns to
expect this bow and be on the lookout and ready to return it; but to
learn to lead off and make the initial bow one’s self is a difficult
matter for a diffident man. One thinks, “If I rise to go, and tender my
box, and these ladies and gentlemen take it into their heads to ignore
the custom of their nation, and not return it, how shall I feel, in case
I survive to feel anything.“ Therefore he is afraid to venture. He sits
out the dinner, and makes the strangers rise first and originate the
bowing. A table d’ho^te dinner is a tedious affair for a man who seldom
touches anything after the three first courses; therefore I used to do
some pretty dreary waiting because of my fears. It took me months to
assure myself that those fears were groundless, but I did assure myself
at last by experimenting diligently through my agent. I made Harris get
up and bow and leave; invariably his bow was returned, then I got up and
bowed myself and retired.</p>
<p>Thus my education proceeded easily and comfortably for me, but not
for Harris. Three courses of a table d’ho^te dinner were enough for me,
but Harris preferred thirteen.</p>
<p>Even after I had acquired full confidence, and no longer needed the
agent’s help, I sometimes encountered difficulties. Once at Baden-Baden
I nearly lost a train because I could not be sure that three young
ladies opposite me at table were Germans, since I had not heard them
speak; they might be American, they might be English, it was not safe to
venture a bow; but just as I had got that far with my thought, one of
them began a German remark, to my great relief and gratitude; and before
she got out her third word, our bows had been delivered and graciously
returned, and we were off.</p>
<p>There is a friendly something about the German character which is
very winning. When Harris and I were making a pedestrian tour through
the Black Forest, we stopped at a little country inn for dinner one day;
two young ladies and a young gentleman entered and sat down opposite us.
They were pedestrians, too. Our knapsacks were strapped upon our backs,
but they had a sturdy youth along to carry theirs for them. All parties
were hungry, so there was no talking. By and by the usual bows were
exchanged, and we separated.</p>
<p>As we sat at a late breakfast in the hotel at Allerheiligen, next
morning, these young people and took places near us without observing
us; but presently they saw us and at once bowed and smiled; not
ceremoniously, but with the gratified look of people who have found
acquaintances where they were expecting strangers. Then they spoke of
the weather and the roads. We also spoke of the weather and the roads.
Next, they said they had had an enjoyable walk, notwithstanding the
weather. We said that that had been our case, too. Then they said they
had walked thirty English miles the day before, and asked how many we
had walked. I could not lie, so I told Harris to do it. Harris told them
we had made thirty English miles, too. That was true; we had “made“
them, though we had had a little assistance here and there.</p>
<p>After breakfast they found us trying to blast some information out of
the dumb hotel clerk about routes, and observing that we were not
succeeding pretty well, they went and got their maps and things, and
pointed out and explained our course so clearly that even a New York
detective could have followed it. And when we started they spoke out a
hearty good-by and wished us a pleasant journey. Perhaps they were more
generous with us than they might have been with native wayfarers because
we were a forlorn lot and in a strange land; I don’t know; I only know
it was lovely to be treated so.</p>
<p>Very well, I took an American young lady to one of the fine balls in
Baden-Baden, one night, and at the entrance-door upstairs we were halted
by an official–something about Miss Jones’s dress was not according to
rule; I don’t remember what it was, now; something was wanting–her back
hair, or a shawl, or a fan, or a shovel, or something. The official was
ever so polite, and every so sorry, but the rule was strict, and he
could not let us in. It was very embarrassing, for many eyes were on us.
But now a richly dressed girl stepped out of the ballroom, inquired into
the trouble, and said she could fix it in a moment. She took Miss Jones
to the robing-room, and soon brought her back in regulation trim, and
then we entered the ballroom with this benefactress unchallenged.</p>
<p>Being safe, now, I began to puzzle through my sincere but
ungrammatical thanks, when there was a sudden mutual recognition –the
benefactress and I had met at Allerheiligen. Two weeks had not altered
her good face, and plainly her heart was in the right place yet, but
there was such a difference between these clothes and the clothes I had
seen her in before, when she was walking thirty miles a day in the Black
Forest, that it was quite natural that I had failed to recognize her
sooner. I had on MY other suit, too, but my German would betray me to a
person who had heard it once, anyway. She brought her brother and
sister, and they made our way smooth for that evening.</p>
<p>Well–months afterward, I was driving through the streets of Munich in
a cab with a German lady, one day, when she said:</p>
<p>“There, that is Prince Ludwig and his wife, walking along there.“</p>
<p>Everybody was bowing to them–cabmen, little children, and everybody
else–and they were returning all the bows and overlooking nobody, when a
young lady met them and made a deep courtesy.</p>
<p>“That is probably one of the ladies of the court,“ said my German
friend.</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>“She is an honor to it, then. I know her. I don’t know her name, but
I know HER. I have known her at Allerheiligen and Baden-Baden. She ought
to be an Empress, but she may be only a Duchess; it is the way things go
in this way.“</p>
<p>If one asks a German a civil question, he will be quite sure to get a
civil answer. If you stop a German in the street and ask him to direct
you to a certain place, he shows no sign of feeling offended. If the
place be difficult to find, ten to one the man will drop his own matters
and go with you and show you.</p>
<p>In London, too, many a time, strangers have walked several blocks
with me to show me my way.</p>
<p>There is something very real about this sort of politeness. Quite
often, in Germany, shopkeepers who could not furnish me the article I
wanted have sent one of their employees with me to show me a place where
it could be had.</p>
