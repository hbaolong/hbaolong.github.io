<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>[Scene–The Studio.]</p>
<p>“The six months will be up at two o’clock to-day! Oh, agony! My life
is blighted. I would that I were dead. I had no supper yesterday. I have
had no breakfast to-day. I dare not enter an eating-house. And hungry?
–don’t mention it! My bootmaker duns me to death–my tailor duns me –my
landlord haunts me. I am miserable. I haven’t seen John since that awful
day. She smiles on me tenderly when we meet in the great thoroughfares,
but her old flint of a father makes her look in the other direction in
short order. Now who is knocking at that door? Who is come to persecute
me? That malignant villain the bootmaker, I’ll warrant. Come in!“</p>
<p>“Ah, happiness attend your highness–Heaven be propitious to your
grace! I have brought my lord’s new boots–ah, say nothing about the pay,
there is no hurry, none in the world. Shall be proud if my noble lord
will continue to honor me with his custom–ah, adieu!“</p>
<p>“Brought the boots himself! Don’t wait his pay! Takes his leave with
a bow and a scrape fit to honor majesty withal! Desires a continuance of
my custom! Is the world coming to an end? Of all the–come in!“</p>
<p>“Pardon, signore, but I have brought your new suit of clothes
for–“</p>
<p>“Come in!“</p>
<p>“A thousand pardons for this intrusion, your worship. But I have
prepared the beautiful suite of rooms below for you–this wretched den is
but ill suited to–“</p>
<p>“Come in!“</p>
<p>“I have called to say that your credit at our bank, some time since
unfortunately interrupted, is entirely and most satisfactorily restored,
and we shall be most happy if you will draw upon us for any–“</p>
<p>“COME IN!“</p>
<p>“My noble boy, she is yours! She’ll be here in a moment! Take her
–marry her–love her–be happy!–God bless you both! Hip, hip, hur–“</p>
<p>“COME IN!!!!!“</p>
<p>“Oh, George, my own darling, we are saved!“</p>
<p>“Oh, Mary, my own darling, we are saved–but I’ll swear I don’t know
why nor how!“</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>[Scene-A Roman Cafe.]</p>
<p>One of a group of American gentlemen reads and translates from the
weekly edition of ‘Il Slangwhanger di Roma’ as follows:</p>
<p>WONDERFUL DISCOVERY–Some six months ago Signor John Smitthe, an
American gentleman now some years a resident of Rome, purchased for a
trifle a small piece of ground in the Campagna, just beyond the tomb of
the Scipio family, from the owner, a bankrupt relative of the Princess
Borghese. Mr. Smitthe afterward went to the Minister of the Public
Records and had the piece of ground transferred to a poor American
artist named George Arnold, explaining that he did it as payment and
satisfaction for pecuniary damage accidentally done by him long since
upon property belonging to Signor Arnold, and further observed that he
would make additional satisfaction by improving the ground for Signor
A., at his own charge and cost. Four weeks ago, while making some
necessary excavations upon the property, Signor Smitthe unearthed the
most remarkable ancient statue that has ever bees added to the opulent
art treasures of Rome. It was an exquisite figure of a woman, and though
sadly stained by the soil and the mold of ages, no eye can look unmoved
upon its ravishing beauty. The nose, the left leg from the knee down, an
ear, and also the toes of the right foot and two fingers of one of the
hands were gone, but otherwise the noble figure was in a remarkable
state of preservation. The government at once took military possession
of the statue, and appointed a commission of art-critics, antiquaries,
and cardinal princes of the church to assess its value and determine the
remuneration that must go to the owner of the ground in which it was
found. The whole affair was kept a profound secret until last night. In
the mean time the commission sat with closed doors and deliberated. Last
night they decided unanimously that the statue is a Venus, and the work
of some unknown but sublimely gifted artist of the third century before
Christ. They consider it the most faultless work of art the world has
any knowledge of.</p>
<p>At midnight they held a final conference and, decided that the Venus
was worth the enormous sum of ten million francs! In accordance with
Roman law and Roman usage, the government being half-owner in all works
of art found in the Campagna, the State has naught to do but pay five
million francs to Mr. Arnold and take permanent possession of the
beautiful statue. This morning the Venus will be removed to the Capitol,
there to remain, and at noon the commission will wait upon Signor Arnold
with His Holiness the Pope’s order upon the Treasury for the princely
sum of five million francs is gold!</p>
<p>Chorus of Voices.–“Luck! It’s no name for it!“</p>
<p>Another Voice.–“Gentlemen, I propose that we immediately form an
American joint-stock company for the purchase of lands and excavations
of statues here, with proper connections in Wall Street to bull and bear
the stock.“</p>
<p>All.–“Agreed.“</p>
