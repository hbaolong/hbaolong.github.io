<h4 id="chapter-vii.">CHAPTER VII.</h4>
<p>During three days the couple walked upon air, with their heads in the
clouds. They were but vaguely conscious of their surroundings; they saw
all things dimly, as through a veil; they were steeped in dreams, often
they did not hear when they were spoken to; they often did not
understand when they heard; they answered confusedly or at random; Sally
sold molasses by weight, sugar by the yard, and furnished soap when
asked for candles, and Aleck put the cat in the wash and fed milk to the
soiled linen. Everybody was stunned and amazed, and went about
muttering, “What CAN be the matter with the Fosters?“</p>
<p>Three days. Then came events! Things had taken a happy turn, and for
forty-eight hours Aleck’s imaginary corner had been booming. Up–up–still
up! Cost point was passed. Still up–and up –and up! Cost point was
passed. STill up–and up–and up! Five points above cost–then
ten–fifteen–twenty! Twenty points cold profit on the vast venture, now,
and Aleck’s imaginary brokers were shouting frantically by imaginary
long-distance, “Sell! sell! for Heaven’s sake SELL!“</p>
<p>She broke the splendid news to Sally, and he, too, said, “Sell!
sell–oh, don’t make a blunder, now, you own the earth! –sell, sell!“ But
she set her iron will and lashed it amidships, and said she would hold
on for five points more if she died for it.</p>
<p>It was a fatal resolve. The very next day came the historic crash,
the record crash, the devastating crash, when the bottom fell out of
Wall Street, and the whole body of gilt-edged stocks dropped ninety-five
points in five hours, and the multimillionaire was seen begging his
bread in the Bowery. Aleck sternly held her grip and “put up“ as long as
she could, but at last there came a call which she was powerless to
meet, and her imaginary brokers sold her out. Then, and not till then,
the man in her was vanished, and the woman in her resumed sway. She put
her arms about her husband’s neck and wept, saying:</p>
<p>“I am to blame, do not forgive me, I cannot bear it. We are paupers!
Paupers, and I am so miserable. The weddings will never come off; all
that is past; we could not even buy the dentist, now.“</p>
<p>A bitter reproach was on Sally’s tongue: “I BEGGED you to sell, but
you–“ He did not say it; he had not the heart to add a hurt to that
broken and repentant spirit. A nobler thought came to him and he
said:</p>
<p>“Bear up, my Aleck, all is not lost! You really never invested a
penny of my uncle’s bequest, but only its unmaterialized future; what we
have lost was only the incremented harvest from that future by your
incomparable financial judgment and sagacity. Cheer up, banish these
griefs; we still have the thirty thousand untouched; and with the
experience which you have acquired, think what you will be able to do
with it in a couple years! The marriages are not off, they are only
postponed.“</p>
<p>These are blessed words. Aleck saw how true they were, and their
influence was electric; her tears ceased to flow, and her great spirit
rose to its full stature again. With flashing eye and grateful heart,
and with hand uplifted in pledge and prophecy, she said:</p>
<p>“Now and here I proclaim–“</p>
<p>But she was interrupted by a visitor. It was the editor and
proprietor of the SAGAMORE. He had happened into Lakeside to pay a
duty-call upon an obscure grandmother of his who was nearing the end of
her pilgrimage, and with the idea of combining business with grief he
had looked up the Fosters, who had been so absorbed in other things for
the past four years that they neglected to pay up their subscription.
Six dollars due. No visitor could have been more welcome. He would know
all about Uncle Tilbury and what his chances might be getting to be,
cemeterywards. They could, of course, ask no questions, for that would
squelch the bequest, but they could nibble around on the edge of the
subject and hope for results. The scheme did not work. The obtuse editor
did not know he was being nibbled at; but at last, chance accomplished
what art had failed in. In illustration of something under discussion
which required the help of metaphor, the editor said:</p>
<p>“Land, it’s a tough as Tilbury Foster!–as WE say.“</p>
<p>It was sudden, and it made the Fosters jump. The editor noticed, and
said, apologetically:</p>
<p>“No harm intended, I assure you. It’s just a saying; just a joke, you
know–nothing of it. Relation of yours?“</p>
<p>Sally crowded his burning eagerness down, and answered with all the
indifference he could assume:</p>
<p>“I–well, not that I know of, but we’ve heard of him.“ The editor was
thankful, and resumed his composure. Sally added: “Is he –is
he–well?“</p>
<p>“Is he WELL? Why, bless you he’s in Sheol these five years!“</p>
<p>The Fosters were trembling with grief, though it felt like joy. Sally
said, non-committally–and tentatively:</p>
<p>“Ah, well, such is life, and none can escape–not even the rich are
spared.“</p>
<p>The editor laughed.</p>
<p>“If you are including Tilbury,“ said he, “it don’t apply. HE hadn’t a
cent; the town had to bury him.“</p>
<p>The Fosters sat petrified for two minutes; petrified and cold. Then,
white-faced and weak-voiced, Sally asked:</p>
<p>“Is it true? Do you KNOW it to be true?“</p>
<p>“Well, I should say! I was one of the executors. He hadn’t anything
to leave but a wheelbarrow, and he left that to me. It hadn’t any wheel,
and wasn’t any good. Still, it was something, and so, to square up, I
scribbled off a sort of a little obituarial send-off for him, but it got
crowded out.“</p>
<p>The Fosters were not listening–their cup was full, it could contain
no more. They sat with bowed heads, dead to all things but the ache at
their hearts.</p>
<p>An hour later. Still they sat there, bowed, motionless, silent, the
visitor long ago gone, they unaware.</p>
<p>Then they stirred, and lifted their heads wearily, and gazed at each
other wistfully, dreamily, dazed; then presently began to twaddle to
each other in a wandering and childish way. At intervals they lapsed
into silences, leaving a sentence unfinished, seemingly either unaware
of it or losing their way. Sometimes, when they woke out of these
silences they had a dim and transient consciousness that something had
happened to their minds; then with a dumb and yearning solicitude they
would softly caress each other’s hands in mutual compassion and support,
as if they would say: “I am near you, I will not forsake you, we will
bear it together; somewhere there is release and forgetfulness,
somewhere there is a grave and peace; be patient, it will not be
long.“</p>
<p>They lived yet two years, in mental night, always brooding, steeped
in vague regrets and melancholy dreams, never speaking; then release
came to both on the same day.</p>
<p>Toward the end the darkness lifted from Sally’s ruined mind for a
moment, and he said:</p>
<p>“Vast wealth, acquired by sudden and unwholesome means, is a snare.
It did us no good, transient were its feverish pleasures; yet for its
sake we threw away our sweet and simple and happy life –let others take
warning by us.“</p>
<p>He lay silent awhile, with closed eyes; then as the chill of death
crept upward toward his heart, and consciousness was fading from his
brain, he muttered:</p>
<p>“Money had brought him misery, and he took his revenge upon us, who
had done him no harm. He had his desire: with base and cunning
calculation he left us but thirty thousand, knowing we would try to
increase it, and ruin our life and break our hearts. Without added
expense he could have left us far above desire of increase, far above
the temptation to speculate, and a kinder soul would have done it; but
in him was no generous spirit, no pity, no–“</p>
<h2 id="a-dogs-tale">A DOG’S TALE</h2>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>My father was a St. Bernard, my mother was a collie, but I am a
Presbyterian. This is what my mother told me, I do not know these nice
distinctions myself. To me they are only fine large words meaning
nothing. My mother had a fondness for such; she liked to say them, and
see other dogs look surprised and envious, as wondering how she got so
much education. But, indeed, it was not real education; it was only
show: she got the words by listening in the dining-room and drawing-room
when there was company, and by going with the children to Sunday-school
and listening there; and whenever she heard a large word she said it
over to herself many times, and so was able to keep it until there was a
dogmatic gathering in the neighborhood, then she would get it off, and
surprise and distress them all, from pocket-pup to mastiff, which
rewarded her for all her trouble. If there was a stranger he was nearly
sure to be suspicious, and when he got his breath again he would ask her
what it meant. And she always told him. He was never expecting this but
thought he would catch her; so when she told him, he was the one that
looked ashamed, whereas he had thought it was going to be she. The
others were always waiting for this, and glad of it and proud of her,
for they knew what was going to happen, because they had had experience.
When she told the meaning of a big word they were all so taken up with
admiration that it never occurred to any dog to doubt if it was the
right one; and that was natural, because, for one thing, she answered up
so promptly that it seemed like a dictionary speaking, and for another
thing, where could they find out whether it was right or not? for she
was the only cultivated dog there was. By and by, when I was older, she
brought home the word Unintellectual, one time, and worked it pretty
hard all the week at different gatherings, making much unhappiness and
despondency; and it was at this time that I noticed that during that
week she was asked for the meaning at eight different assemblages, and
flashed out a fresh definition every time, which showed me that she had
more presence of mind than culture, though I said nothing, of course.
She had one word which she always kept on hand, and ready, like a
life-preserver, a kind of emergency word to strap on when she was likely
to get washed overboard in a sudden way–that was the word Synonymous.
When she happened to fetch out a long word which had had its day weeks
before and its prepared meanings gone to her dump-pile, if there was a
stranger there of course it knocked him groggy for a couple of minutes,
then he would come to, and by that time she would be away down wind on
another tack, and not expecting anything; so when he’d hail and ask her
to cash in, I (the only dog on the inside of her game) could see her
canvas flicker a moment –but only just a moment–then it would belly out
taut and full, and she would say, as calm as a summer’s day, “It’s
synonymous with supererogation,“ or some godless long reptile of a word
like that, and go placidly about and skim away on the next tack,
perfectly comfortable, you know, and leave that stranger looking profane
and embarrassed, and the initiated slatting the floor with their tails
in unison and their faces transfigured with a holy joy.</p>
<p>And it was the same with phrases. She would drag home a whole phrase,
if it had a grand sound, and play it six nights and two matinees, and
explain it a new way every time–which she had to, for all she cared for
was the phrase; she wasn’t interested in what it meant, and knew those
dogs hadn’t wit enough to catch her, anyway. Yes, she was a daisy! She
got so she wasn’t afraid of anything, she had such confidence in the
ignorance of those creatures. She even brought anecdotes that she had
heard the family and the dinner-guests laugh and shout over; and as a
rule she got the nub of one chestnut hitched onto another chestnut,
where, of course, it didn’t fit and hadn’t any point; and when she
delivered the nub she fell over and rolled on the floor and laughed and
barked in the most insane way, while I could see that she was wondering
to herself why it didn’t seem as funny as it did when she first heard
it. But no harm was done; the others rolled and barked too, privately
ashamed of themselves for not seeing the point, and never suspecting
that the fault was not with them and there wasn’t any to see.</p>
<p>You can see by these things that she was of a rather vain and
frivolous character; still, she had virtues, and enough to make up, I
think. She had a kind heart and gentle ways, and never harbored
resentments for injuries done her, but put them easily out of her mind
and forgot them; and she taught her children her kindly way, and from
her we learned also to be brave and prompt in time of danger, and not to
run away, but face the peril that threatened friend or stranger, and
help him the best we could without stopping to think what the cost might
be to us. And she taught us not by words only, but by example, and that
is the best way and the surest and the most lasting. Why, the brave
things she did, the splendid things! she was just a soldier; and so
modest about it–well, you couldn’t help admiring her, and you couldn’t
help imitating her; not even a King Charles spaniel could remain
entirely despicable in her society. So, as you see, there was more to
her than her education.</p>
