<h4 id="chapter-liii.">CHAPTER LIII.</h4>
<p>True irreverence is disrespect for another man’s god. –Pudd’nhead
Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>It was in Benares that I saw another living god. That makes two. I
believe I have seen most of the greater and lesser wonders of the world,
but I do not remember that any of them interested me so overwhelmingly
as did that pair of gods.</p>
<p>When I try to account for this effect I find no difficulty about it.
I find that, as a rule, when a thing is a wonder to us it is not because
of what we see in it, but because of what others have seen in it. We get
almost all our wonders at second hand. We are eager to see any
celebrated thing–and we never fail of our reward; just the deep
privilege of gazing upon an object which has stirred the enthusiasm or
evoked the reverence or affection or admiration of multitudes of our
race is a thing which we value; we are profoundly glad that we have seen
it, we are permanently enriched from having seen it, we would not part
with the memory of that experience for a great price. And yet that very
spectacle may be the Taj. You cannot keep your enthusiasms down, you
cannot keep your emotions within bounds when that soaring bubble of
marble breaks upon your view. But these are not your enthusiasms and
emotions–they are the accumulated emotions and enthusiasms of a thousand
fervid writers, who have been slowly and steadily storing them up in
your heart day by day and year by year all your life; and now they burst
out in a flood and overwhelm you; and you could not be a whit happier if
they were your very own. By and by you sober down, and then you perceive
that you have been drunk on the smell of somebody else’s cork. For ever
and ever the memory of my distant first glimpse of the Taj will
compensate me for creeping around the globe to have that great
privilege.</p>
<p>But the Taj–with all your inflation of delusive emotions, acquired at
second-hand from people to whom in the majority of cases they were also
delusions acquired at second-hand–a thing which you fortunately did not
think of or it might have made you doubtful of what you imagined were
your own what is the Taj as a marvel, a spectacle and an uplifting and
overpowering wonder, compared with a living, breathing, speaking
personage whom several millions of human beings devoutly and sincerely
and unquestioningly believe to be a God, and humbly and gratefully
worship as a God?</p>
<p>He was sixty years old when I saw him. He is called Sri 108 Swami
Bhaskarananda Saraswati. That is one form of it. I think that that is
what you would call him in speaking to him–because it is short. But you
would use more of his name in addressing a letter to him; courtesy would
require this. Even then you would not have to use all of it, but only
this much:</p>
<p>Sri 108
Matparamahansrzpairivrajakacharyaswamibhaskaranandasaraswati.</p>
<p>You do not put “Esq.“ after it, for that is not necessary. The word
which opens the volley is itself a title of honor “Sri.“ The “108“
stands for the rest of his names, I believe. Vishnu has 108 names which
he does not use in business, and no doubt it is a custom of gods and a
privilege sacred to their order to keep 108 extra ones in stock. Just
the restricted name set down above is a handsome property, without the
108. By my count it has 58 letters in it. This removes the long German
words from competition; they are permanently out of the race.</p>
<p>Sri 108 S. B. Saraswati has attained to what among the Hindoos is
called the “state of perfection.“ It is a state which other Hindoos
reach by being born again and again, and over and over again into this
world, through one re-incarnation after another–a tiresome long job
covering centuries and decades of centuries, and one that is full of
risks, too, like the accident of dying on the wrong side of the Ganges
some time or other and waking up in the form of an ass, with a fresh
start necessary and the numerous trips to be made all over again. But in
reaching perfection, Sri 108 S. B. S. has escaped all that. He is no
longer a part or a feature of this world; his substance has changed, all
earthiness has departed out of it; he is utterly holy, utterly pure;
nothing can desecrate this holiness or stain this purity; he is no
longer of the earth, its concerns are matters foreign to him, its pains
and griefs and troubles cannot reach him. When he dies, Nirvana is his;
he will be absorbed into the substance of the Supreme Deity and be at
peace forever.</p>
<p>The Hindoo Scriptures point out how this state is to be reached, but
it is only once in a thousand years, perhaps, that candidate
accomplishes it. This one has traversed the course required, stage by
stage, from the beginning to the end, and now has nothing left to do but
wait for the call which shall release him from a world in which he has
now no part nor lot. First, he passed through the student stage, and
became learned in the holy books. Next he became citizen, householder,
husband, and father. That was the required second stage. Then–like John
Bunyan’s Christian he bade perpetual good-bye to his family, as
required, and went wandering away. He went far into the desert and
served a term as hermit. Next, he became a beggar, “in accordance with
the rites laid down in the Scriptures,“ and wandered about India eating
the bread of mendicancy. A quarter of a century ago he reached the stage
of purity. This needs no garment; its symbol is nudity; he discarded the
waist-cloth which he had previously worn. He could resume it now if he
chose, for neither that nor any other contact can defile him; but he
does not choose.</p>
<p>There are several other stages, I believe, but I do not remember what
they are. But he has been through them. Throughout the long course he
was perfecting himself in holy learning, and writing commentaries upon
the sacred books. He was also meditating upon Brahma, and he does that
now.</p>
<p>White marble relief-portraits of him are sold all about India. He
lives in a good house in a noble great garden in Benares, all meet and
proper to his stupendous rank. Necessarily he does not go abroad in the
streets. Deities would never be able to move about handily in any
country. If one whom we recognized and adored as a god should go abroad
in our streets, and the day it was to happen were known, all traffic
would be blocked and business would come to a standstill.</p>
<p>This god is comfortably housed, and yet modestly, all things
considered, for if he wanted to live in a palace he would only need to
speak and his worshipers would gladly build it. Sometimes he sees
devotees for a moment, and comforts them and blesses them, and they kiss
his feet and go away happy. Rank is nothing to him, he being a god. To
him all men are alike. He sees whom he pleases and denies himself to
whom he pleases. Sometimes he sees a prince and denies himself to a
pauper; at other times he receives the pauper and turns the prince away.
However, he does not receive many of either class. He has to husband his
time for his meditations. I think he would receive Rev. Mr. Parker at
any time. I think he is sorry for Mr. Parker, and I think Mr. Parker is
sorry for him; and no doubt this compassion is good for both of
them.</p>
<p>When we arrived we had to stand around in the garden a little while
and wait, and the outlook was not good, for he had been turning away
Maharajas that day and receiving only the riff-raff, and we belonged in
between, somewhere. But presently, a servant came out saying it was all
right, he was coming.</p>
<p>And sure enough, he came, and I saw him–that object of the worship of
millions. It was a strange sensation, and thrilling. I wish I could feel
it stream through my veins again. And yet, to me he was not a god, he
was only a Taj. The thrill was not my thrill, but had come to me
secondhand from those invisible millions of believers. By a hand-shake
with their god I had ground-circuited their wire and got their monster
battery’s whole charge.</p>
<p>He was tall and slender, indeed emaciated. He had a clean cut and
conspicuously intellectual face, and a deep and kindly eye. He looked
many years older than he really was, but much study and meditation and
fasting and prayer, with the arid life he had led as hermit and beggar,
could account for that. He is wholly nude when he receives natives, of
whatever rank they may be, but he had white cloth around his loins now,
a concession to Mr. Parker’s Europe prejudices, no doubt.</p>
<p>As soon as I had sobered down a little we got along very well
together, and I found him a most pleasant and friendly deity. He had
heard a deal about Chicago, and showed a quite remarkable interest in
it, for a god. It all came of the World’s Fair and the Congress of
Religions. If India knows about nothing else American, she knows about
those, and will keep them in mind one while.</p>
<p>He proposed an exchange of autographs, a delicate attention which
made me believe in him, but I had been having my doubts before. He wrote
his in his book, and I have a reverent regard for that book, though the
words run from right to left, and so I can’t read it. It was a mistake
to print in that way. It contains his voluminous comments on the Hindoo
holy writings, and if I could make them out I would try for perfection
myself. I gave him a copy of Huckleberry Finn. I thought it might rest
him up a little to mix it in along with his meditations on Brahma, for
he looked tired, and I knew that if it didn’t do him any good it
wouldn’t do him any harm.</p>
<p>He has a scholar meditating under him–Mina Bahadur Rana–but we did
not see him. He wears clothes and is very imperfect. He has written a
little pamphlet about his master, and I have that. It contains a
wood-cut of the master and himself seated on a rug in the garden. The
portrait of the master is very good indeed. The posture is exactly that
which Brahma himself affects, and it requires long arms and limber legs,
and can be accumulated only by gods and the india-rubber man. There is a
life-size marble relief of Shri 108, S.B.S. in the garden. It represents
him in this same posture.</p>
<p>Dear me! It is a strange world. Particularly the Indian division of
it. This pupil, Mina Bahadur Rana, is not a commonplace person, but a
man of distinguished capacities and attainments, and, apparently, he had
a fine worldly career in front of him. He was serving the Nepal
Government in a high capacity at the Court of the Viceroy of India,
twenty years ago. He was an able man, educated, a thinker, a man of
property. But the longing to devote himself to a religious life came
upon him, and he resigned his place, turned his back upon the vanities
and comforts of the world, and went away into the solitudes to live in a
hut and study the sacred writings and meditate upon virtue and holiness
and seek to attain them. This sort of religion resembles ours. Christ
recommended the rich to give away all their property and follow Him in
poverty, not in worldly comfort. American and English millionaires do it
every day, and thus verify and confirm to the world the tremendous
forces that lie in religion. Yet many people scoff at them for this
loyalty to duty, and many will scoff at Mina Bahadur Rana and call him a
crank. Like many Christians of great character and intellect, he has
made the study of his Scriptures and the writing of books of
commentaries upon them the loving labor of his life. Like them, he has
believed that his was not an idle and foolish waste of his life, but a
most worthy and honorable employment of it. Yet, there are many people
who will see in those others, men worthy of homage and deep reverence,
but in him merely a crank. But I shall not. He has my reverence. And I
don’t offer it as a common thing and poor, but as an unusual thing and
of value. The ordinary reverence, the reverence defined and explained by
the dictionary costs nothing. Reverence for one’s own sacred
things–parents, religion, flag, laws, and respect for one’s own
beliefs–these are feelings which we cannot even help. They come natural
to us; they are involuntary, like breathing. There is no personal merit
in breathing. But the reverence which is difficult, and which has
personal merit in it, is the respect which you pay, without compulsion,
to the political or religious attitude of a man whose beliefs are not
yours. You can’t revere his gods or his politics, and no one expects you
to do that, but you could respect his belief in them if you tried hard
enough; and you could respect him, too, if you tried hard enough. But it
is very, very difficult; it is next to impossible, and so we hardly ever
try. If the man doesn’t believe as we do, we say he is a crank, and that
settles it. I mean it does nowadays, because now we can’t burn him.</p>
<p>We are always canting about people’s “irreverence,“ always charging
this offense upon somebody or other, and thereby intimating that we are
better than that person and do not commit that offense ourselves.
Whenever we do this we are in a lying attitude, and our speech is cant;
for none of us are reverent–in a meritorious way; deep down in our
hearts we are all irreverent. There is probably not a single exception
to this rule in the earth. There is probably not one person whose
reverence rises higher than respect for his own sacred things; and
therefore, it is not a thing to boast about and be proud of, since the
most degraded savage has that –and, like the best of us, has nothing
higher. To speak plainly, we despise all reverences and all objects of
reverence which are outside the pale of our own list of sacred things.
And yet, with strange inconsistency, we are shocked when other people
despise and defile the things which are holy to us. Suppose we should
meet with a paragraph like the following, in the newspapers:</p>
<p>“Yesterday a visiting party of the British nobility had a picnic at
Mount Vernon, and in the tomb of Washington they ate their luncheon,
sang popular songs, played games, and danced waltzes and polkas.“</p>
<p>Should we be shocked? Should we feel outraged? Should we be amazed?
Should we call the performance a desecration? Yes, that would all
happen. We should denounce those people in round terms, and call them
hard names.</p>
<p>And suppose we found this paragraph in the newspapers:</p>
<p>“Yesterday a visiting party of American pork-millionaires had a
picnic in Westminster Abbey, and in that sacred place they ate their
luncheon, sang popular songs, played games, and danced waltzes and
polkas.“</p>
<p>Would the English be shocked? Would they feel outraged? Would they be
amazed? Would they call the performance a desecration? That would all
happen. The pork-millionaires would be denounced in round terms; they
would be called hard names.</p>
<p>In the tomb at Mount Vernon lie the ashes of America’s most honored
son; in the Abbey, the ashes of England’s greatest dead; the tomb of
tombs, the costliest in the earth, the wonder of the world, the Taj, was
built by a great Emperor to honor the memory of a perfect wife and
perfect mother, one in whom there was no spot or blemish, whose love was
his stay and support, whose life was the light of the world to him; in
it her ashes lie, and to the Mohammedan millions of India it is a holy
place; to them it is what Mount Vernon is to Americans, it is what the
Abbey is to the English.</p>
<p>Major Sleeman wrote forty or fifty years ago (the italics are
mine):</p>
<p>“I would here enter my humble protest against the quadrille and lunch
parties which are sometimes given to European ladies and gentlemen of
the station at this imperial tomb; drinking and dancing are no doubt
very good things in their season, but they are sadly out of place in a
sepulchre.“</p>
<p>Were there any Americans among those lunch parties? If they were
invited, there were.</p>
<p>If my imagined lunch-parties in Westminster and the tomb of
Washington should take place, the incident would cause a vast outbreak
of bitter eloquence about Barbarism and Irreverence; and it would come
from two sets of people who would go next day and dance in the Taj if
they had a chance.</p>
<p>As we took our leave of the Benares god and started away we noticed a
group of natives waiting respectfully just within the gate–a Rajah from
somewhere in India, and some people of lesser consequence. The god
beckoned them to come, and as we passed out the Rajah was kneeling and
reverently kissing his sacred feet.</p>
<p>If Barnum–but Barnum’s ambitions are at rest. This god will remain in
the holy peace and seclusion of his garden, undisturbed. Barnum could
not have gotten him, anyway. Still, he would have found a substitute
that would answer.</p>
