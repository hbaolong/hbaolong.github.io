<h4 id="chapter-liv.">CHAPTER LIV.</h4>
<p>Do not undervalue the headache. While it is at its sharpest it seems
a bad investment; but when relief begins, the unexpired remainder is
worth a minute. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>A comfortable railway journey of seventeen and a half hours brought
us to the capital of India, which is likewise the capital of
Bengal–Calcutta. Like Bombay, it has a population of nearly a million
natives and a small gathering of white people. It is a huge city and
fine, and is called the City of Palaces. It is rich in historical
memories; rich in British achievement–military, political, commercial;
rich in the results of the miracles done by that brace of mighty
magicians, Clive and Hastings. And has a cloud kissing monument to one
Ochterlony.</p>
<p>It is a fluted candlestick 250 feet high. This lingam is the only
large monument in Calcutta, I believe. It is a fine ornament, and will
keep Ochterlony in mind.</p>
<p>Wherever you are, in Calcutta, and for miles around, you can see it;
and always when you see it you think of Ochterlony. And so there is not
an hour in the day that you do not think of Ochterlony and wonder who he
was. It is good that Clive cannot come back, for he would think it was
for Plassey; and then that great spirit would be wounded when the
revelation came that it was not. Clive would find out that it was for
Ochterlony; and he would think Ochterlony was a battle. And he would
think it was a great one, too, and he would say, “With three thousand I
whipped sixty thousand and founded the Empire–and there is no monument;
this other soldier must have whipped a billion with a dozen and saved
the world.“</p>
<p>But he would be mistaken. Ochterlony was a man, not a battle. And he
did good and honorable service, too; as good and honorable service as
has been done in India by seventy-five or a hundred other Englishmen of
courage, rectitude, and distinguished capacity. For India has been a
fertile breeding-ground of such men, and remains so; great men, both in
war and in the civil service, and as modest as great. But they have no
monuments, and were not expecting any. Ochterlony could not have been
expecting one, and it is not at all likely that he desired one–certainly
not until Clive and Hastings should be supplied. Every day Clive and
Hastings lean on the battlements of heaven and look down and wonder
which of the two the monument is for; and they fret and worry because
they cannot find out, and so the peace of heaven is spoiled for them and
lost. But not for Ochterlony. Ochterlony is not troubled. He doesn’t
suspect that it is his monument. Heaven is sweet and peaceful to him.
There is a sort of unfairness about it all.</p>
<p>Indeed, if monuments were always given in India for high
achievements, duty straitly performed, and smirchless records, the
landscape would be monotonous with them. The handful of English in India
govern the Indian myriads with apparent ease, and without noticeable
friction, through tact, training, and distinguished administrative
ability, reinforced by just and liberal laws–and by keeping their word
to the native whenever they give it.</p>
<p>England is far from India and knows little about the eminent services
performed by her servants there, for it is the newspaper correspondent
who makes fame, and he is not sent to India but to the continent, to
report the doings of the princelets and the dukelets, and where they are
visiting and whom they are marrying. Often a British official spends
thirty or forty years in India, climbing from grade to grade by services
which would make him celebrated anywhere else, and finishes as a
vice-sovereign, governing a great realm and millions of subjects; then
he goes home to England substantially unknown and unheard of, and
settles down in some modest corner, and is as one extinguished. Ten
years later there is a twenty-line obituary in the London papers, and
the reader is paralyzed by the splendors of a career which he is not
sure that he had ever heard of before. But meanwhile he has learned all
about the continental princelets and dukelets.</p>
<p>The average man is profoundly ignorant of countries that lie remote
from his own. When they are mentioned in his presence one or two facts
and maybe a couple of names rise like torches in his mind, lighting up
an inch or two of it and leaving the rest all dark. The mention of Egypt
suggests some Biblical facts and the Pyramids-nothing more. The mention
of South Africa suggests Kimberly and the diamonds and there an end.
Formerly the mention, to a Hindoo, of America suggested a name–George
Washington–with that his familiarity with our country was exhausted.
Latterly his familiarity with it has doubled in bulk; so that when
America is mentioned now, two torches flare up in the dark caverns of
his mind and he says, “Ah, the country of the great man Washington; and
of the Holy City–Chicago.“ For he knows about the Congress of Religion,
and this has enabled him to get an erroneous impression of Chicago.</p>
<p>When India is mentioned to the citizen of a far country it suggests
Clive, Hastings, the Mutiny, Kipling, and a number of other great
events; and the mention of Calcutta infallibly brings up the Black Hole.
And so, when that citizen finds himself in the capital of India he goes
first of all to see the Black Hole of Calcutta–and is disappointed.</p>
<p>The Black Hole was not preserved; it is gone, long, long ago. It is
strange. Just as it stood, it was itself a monument; a ready-made one.
It was finished, it was complete, its materials were strong and lasting,
it needed no furbishing up, no repairs; it merely needed to be let
alone. It was the first brick, the Foundation Stone, upon which was
reared a mighty Empire–the Indian Empire of Great Britain. It was the
ghastly episode of the Black Hole that maddened the British and brought
Clive, that young military marvel, raging up from Madras; it was the
seed from which sprung Plassey; and it was that extraordinary battle,
whose like had not been seen in the earth since Agincourt, that laid
deep and strong the foundations of England’s colossal Indian
sovereignty.</p>
<p>And yet within the time of men who still live, the Black Hole was
torn down and thrown away as carelessly as if its bricks were common
clay, not ingots of historic gold. There is no accounting for human
beings.</p>
<p>The supposed site of the Black Hole is marked by an engraved plate. I
saw that; and better that than nothing. The Black Hole was a prison–a
cell is nearer the right word–eighteen feet square, the dimensions of an
ordinary bedchamber; and into this place the victorious Nabob of Bengal
packed 146 of his English prisoners. There was hardly standing room for
them; scarcely a breath of air was to be got; the time was night, the
weather sweltering hot. Before the dawn came, the captives were all dead
but twenty-three. Mr. Holwell’s long account of the awful episode was
familiar to the world a hundred years ago, but one seldom sees in print
even an extract from it in our day. Among the striking things in it is
this. Mr. Holwell, perishing with thirst, kept himself alive by sucking
the perspiration from his sleeves. It gives one a vivid idea of the
situation. He presently found that while he was busy drawing life from
one of his sleeves a young English gentleman was stealing supplies from
the other one. Holwell was an unselfish man, a man of the most generous
impulses; he lived and died famous for these fine and rare qualities;
yet when he found out what was happening to that unwatched sleeve, he
took the precaution to suck that one dry first. The miseries of the
Black Hole were able to change even a nature like his. But that young
gentleman was one of the twenty-three survivors, and he said it was the
stolen perspiration that saved his life. From the middle of
Mr. Holwell’s narrative I will make a brief excerpt:</p>
<p>“Then a general prayer to Heaven, to hasten the approach of the
flames to the right and left of us, and put a period to our misery. But
these failing, they whose strength and spirits were quite exhausted laid
themselves down and expired quietly upon their fellows: others who had
yet some strength and vigor left made a last effort at the windows, and
several succeeded by leaping and scrambling over the backs and heads of
those in the first rank, and got hold of the bars, from which there was
no removing them. Many to the right and left sunk with the violent
pressure, and were soon suffocated; for now a steam arose from the
living and the dead, which affected us in all its circumstances as if we
were forcibly held with our heads over a bowl full of strong volatile
spirit of hartshorn, until suffocated; nor could the effluvia of the one
be distinguished from the other, and frequently, when I was forced by
the load upon my head and shoulders to hold my face down, I was obliged,
near as I was to the window, instantly to raise it again to avoid
suffocation. I need not, my dear friend, ask your commiseration, when I
tell you, that in this plight, from half an hour past eleven till near
two in the morning, I sustained the weight of a heavy man, with his
knees in my back, and the pressure of his whole body on my head. A Dutch
surgeon who had taken his seat upon my left shoulder, and a Topaz (a
black Christian soldier) bearing on my right; all which nothing could
have enabled me to support but the props and pressure equally sustaining
me all around. The two latter I frequently dislodged by shifting my hold
on the bars and driving my knuckles into their ribs; but my friend above
stuck fast, held immovable by two bars.</p>
<p>“I exerted anew my strength and fortitude; but the repeated trials
and efforts I made to dislodge the insufferable incumbrances upon me at
last quite exhausted me; and towards two o’clock, finding I must quit
the window or sink where I was, I resolved on the former, having bore,
truly for the sake of others, infinitely more for life than the best of
it is worth. In the rank close behind me was an officer of one of the
ships, whose name was Cary, and who had behaved with much bravery during
the siege (his wife, a fine woman, though country born, would not quit
him, but accompanied him into the prison, and was one who survived).
This poor wretch had been long raving for water and air; I told him I
was determined to give up life, and recommended his gaining my station.
On my quitting it he made a fruitless attempt to get my place; but the
Dutch surgeon, who sat on my shoulder, supplanted him. Poor Cary
expressed his thankfulness, and said he would give up life too; but it
was with the utmost labor we forced our way from the window (several in
the inner ranks appearing to me dead standing, unable to fall by the
throng and equal pressure around). He laid himself down to die; and his
death, I believe, was very sudden; for he was a short, full, sanguine
man. His strength was great; and, I imagine, had he not retired with me,
I should never have been able to force my way. I was at this time
sensible of no pain, and little uneasiness; I can give you no better
idea of my situation than by repeating my simile of the bowl of spirit
of hartshorn. I found a stupor coming on apace, and laid myself down by
that gallant old man, the Rev. Mr. Jervas Bellamy, who laid dead with
his son, the lieutenant, hand in hand, near the southernmost wall of the
prison. When I had lain there some little time, I still had reflection
enough to suffer some uneasiness in the thought that I should be
trampled upon, when dead, as I myself had done to others. With some
difficulty I raised myself, and gained the platform a second time, where
I presently lost all sensation; the last trace of sensibility that I
have been able to recollect after my laying down, was my sash being
uneasy about my waist, which I untied, and threw from me. Of what passed
in this interval, to the time of my resurrection from this hole of
horrors, I can give you no account.“</p>
<p>There was plenty to see in Calcutta, but there was not plenty of time
for it. I saw the fort that Clive built; and the place where Warren
Hastings and the author of the Junius Letters fought their duel; and the
great botanical gardens; and the fashionable afternoon turnout in the
Maidan; and a grand review of the garrison in a great plain at sunrise;
and a military tournament in which great bodies of native soldiery
exhibited the perfection of their drill at all arms, a spectacular and
beautiful show occupying several nights and closing with the mimic
storming of a native fort which was as good as the reality for thrilling
and accurate detail, and better than the reality for security and
comfort; we had a pleasure excursion on the ‘Hoogly’ by courtesy of
friends, and devoted the rest of the time to social life and the Indian
museum. One should spend a month in the museum, an enchanted palace of
Indian antiquities. Indeed, a person might spend half a year among the
beautiful and wonderful things without exhausting their interest.</p>
<p>It was winter. We were of Kipling’s “hosts of tourists who travel up
and down India in the cold weather showing how things ought to be
managed.“ It is a common expression there, “the cold weather,“ and the
people think there is such a thing. It is because they have lived there
half a lifetime, and their perceptions have become blunted. When a
person is accustomed to 138 in the shade, his ideas about cold weather
are not valuable. I had read, in the histories, that the June marches
made between Lucknow and Cawnpore by the British forces in the time of
the Mutiny were made weather–138 in the shade and had taken it for
historical embroidery. I had read it again in Serjeant-Major
Forbes-Mitchell’s account of his military experiences in the Mutiny –at
least I thought I had–and in Calcutta I asked him if it was true, and he
said it was. An officer of high rank who had been in the thick of the
Mutiny said the same. As long as those men were talking about what they
knew, they were trustworthy, and I believed them; but when they said it
was now “cold weather,“ I saw that they had traveled outside of their
sphere of knowledge and were floundering. I believe that in India “cold
weather“ is merely a conventional phrase and has come into use through
the necessity of having some way to distinguish between weather which
will melt a brass door-knob and weather which will only make it mushy.
It was observable that brass ones were in use while I was in Calcutta,
showing that it was not yet time to change to porcelain; I was told the
change to porcelain was not usually made until May. But this cold
weather was too warm for us; so we started to Darjeeling, in the
Himalayas–a twenty-four hour journey.</p>
