<h4 id="letter-iv">LETTER IV</h4>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, 18–. DEAR CHING-FOO: I have been here about a month
now, and am learning a little of the language every day. My employer was
disappointed in the matter of hiring us out to service to the
plantations in the far eastern portion of this continent. His enterprise
was a failure, and so he set us all free, merely taking measures to
secure to himself the repayment of the passage money which he paid for
us. We are to make this good to him out of the first moneys we earn
here. He says it is sixty dollars apiece.</p>
<p>We were thus set free about two weeks after we reached here. We had
been massed together in some small houses up to that time, waiting. I
walked forth to seek my fortune. I was to begin life a stranger in a
strange land, without a friend, or a penny, or any clothes but those I
had on my back. I had not any advantage on my side in the world–not one,
except good health and the lack of any necessity to waste any time or
anxiety on the watching of my baggage. No, I forget. I reflected that I
had one prodigious advantage over paupers in other lands–I was in
America! I was in the heaven-provided refuge of the oppressed and the
forsaken!</p>
<p>Just as that comforting thought passed through my mind, some young
men set a fierce dog on me. I tried to defend myself, but could do
nothing. I retreated to the recess of a closed doorway, and there the
dog had me at his mercy, flying at my throat and face or any part of my
body that presented itself. I shrieked for help, but the young men only
jeered and laughed. Two men in gray uniforms ( policemen is their
official title) looked on for a minute and then walked leisurely away.
But a man stopped them and brought them back and told them it was a
shame to leave me in such distress. Then the two policemen beat off the
dog with small clubs, and a comfort it was to be rid of him, though I
was just rags and blood from head to foot. The man who brought the
policemen asked the young men why they abused me in that way, and they
said they didn’t want any of his meddling. And they said to him:</p>
<p>“This Ching divil comes till Ameriky to take the bread out o’ dacent
intilligent white men’s mouths, and whir they try to defind their rights
there’s a dale o’ fuss made about it.“</p>
<p>They began to threaten my benefactor, and as he saw no friendliness
in the faces that had gathered meanwhile, he went on his way. He got
many a curse when he was gone. The policemen now told me I was under
arrest and must go with them. I asked one of them what wrong I had done
to any one that I should be arrested, and he only struck me with his
club and ordered me to “hold my yap.“ With a jeering crowd of street
boys and loafers at my heels, I was taken up an alley and into a
stone-paved dungeon which had large cells all down one side of it, with
iron gates to them. I stood up by a desk while a man behind it wrote
down certain things about me on a slate. One of my captors said:</p>
<p>“Enter a charge against this Chinaman of being disorderly and
disturbing the peace.“</p>
<p>I attempted to say a word, but he said:</p>
<p>“Silence! Now ye had better go slow, my good fellow. This is two or
three times you’ve tried to get off some of your d—d insolence. Lip
won’t do here. You’ve got to simmer down, and if you don’t take to it
paceable we’ll see if we can’t make you. Fat’s your name?“</p>
<p>“Ah Song Hi.“</p>
<p>“Alias what?“</p>
<p>I said I did not understand, and he said what he wanted was my true
name, for he guessed I picked up this one since I stole my last
chickens. They all laughed loudly at that.</p>
<p>Then they searched me. They found nothing, of course. They seemed
very angry and asked who I supposed would “go my bail or pay my fine.“
When they explained these things to me, I said I had done nobody any
harm, and why should I need to have bail or pay a fine? Both of them
kicked me and warned me that I would find it to my advantage to try and
be as civil as convenient. I protested that I had not meant anything
disrespectful. Then one of them took me to one side and said:</p>
<p>“Now look here, Johnny, it’s no use you playing softly wid us. We
mane business, ye know; and the sooner ye put us on the scent of a V,
the asier yell save yerself from a dale of trouble. Ye can’t get out o’
this for anny less. Who’s your frinds?“</p>
<p>I told him I had not a single friend in all the land of America, and
that I was far from home and help, and very poor. And I begged him to
let me go.</p>
<p>He gathered the slack of my blouse collar in his grip and jerked and
shoved and hauled at me across the dungeon, and then unlocking an iron
cell-gate thrust me in with a kick and said:</p>
<p>“Rot there, ye furrin spawn, till ye lairn that there’s no room in
America for the likes of ye or your nation.“</p>
<p>AH SONG HI.</p>
