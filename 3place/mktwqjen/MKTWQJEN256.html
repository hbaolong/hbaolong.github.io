<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family
worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of
the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.</p>
<p>Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to “get
his verses.“ Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.
At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,
but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took
his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the
fog:</p>
<p>“Blessed are the–a–a–“</p>
<p>“Poor“–</p>
<p>“Yes–poor; blessed are the poor–a–a–“</p>
<p>“In spirit–“</p>
<p>“In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they–they–“</p>
<p>“THEIRS–“</p>
<p>“For THEIRS. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they–they–“</p>
<p>“Sh–“</p>
<p>“For they–a–“</p>
<p>“S, H, A–“</p>
<p>“For they S, H–Oh, I don’t know what it is!“</p>
<p>“SHALL!“</p>
<p>“Oh, SHALL! for they shall–for they shall–a–a–shall mourn–a–a–
blessed are they that shall–they that–a–they that shall mourn, for they
shall–a–shall WHAT? Why don’t you tell me, Mary?–what do you want to be
so mean for?“</p>
<p>“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I
wouldn’t do that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be
discouraged, Tom, you’ll manage it–and if you do, I’ll give you
something ever so nice. There, now, that’s a good boy.“</p>
<p>“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.“</p>
<p>“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.“</p>
<p>“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.“</p>
<p>And he did “tackle it again“–and under the double pressure of
curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he
accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow“ knife
worth twelve and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept
his system shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut
anything, but it was a “sure-enough“ Barlow, and there was inconceivable
grandeur in that–though where the Western boys ever got the idea that
such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an
imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to
scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau,
when he was called off to dress for Sunday-school.</p>
<p>Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;
poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen
and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But
Mary removed the towel and said:</p>
<p>“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt
you.“</p>
<p>Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time
he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big
breath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes
shut and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of
suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from the
towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped
short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line
there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she
was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of
color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls
wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately
smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his
hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his
own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his
clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years–they were
simply called his “other clothes“–and so by that we know the size of his
wardrobe. The girl “put him to rights“ after he had dressed himself; she
buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt
collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with his
speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and
uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there was
a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He
hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she
coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them
out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:</p>
<p>“Please, Tom–that’s a good boy.“</p>
<p>So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three
children set out for Sunday-school–a place that Tom hated with his whole
heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.</p>
<p>Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,
and the other always remained too–for stronger reasons. The church’s
high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;
the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board
tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step
and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:</p>
<p>“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“What’ll you take for her?“</p>
<p>“What’ll you give?“</p>
<p>“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.“</p>
<p>“Less see ’em.“</p>
<p>Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed
hands. Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets,
and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid
other boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors
ten or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm
of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started a
quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,
elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
boy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear
him say “Ouch!“ and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole
class were of a pattern–restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came
to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but
had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each
got his reward–in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture
on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten
blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red
tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent
gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times)
to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and
application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And
yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way–it was the patient work of
two years–and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once
recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his
mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot
from that day forth–a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great
occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had
always made this boy come out and “spread himself.“ Only the older
pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work
long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes
was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so
great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s
heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of
weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really
hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being
had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with
it.</p>
<p>In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit,
with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between
its leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent
makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as
necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert –though
why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is
ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim
creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he
wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears
and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth–a
fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the
whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a
spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had
fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of
the day, like sleigh-runners–an effect patiently and laboriously
produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a
wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very
sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places in
such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that
unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar
intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this
fashion:</p>
<p>“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty
as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There
–that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see
one little girl who is looking out of the window–I am afraid she thinks
I am out there somewhere–perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech
to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it
makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a
place like this, learning to do right and be good.“ And so forth and so
on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a
pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.</p>
<p>The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of
isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound
ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the
conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent
gratitude.</p>
<p>A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which
was more or less rare–the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher,
accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged
gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless
the latter’s wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless
and full of chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too–he could not
meet Amy Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he
saw this small new-comer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment.
The next moment he was “showing off“ with all his might –cuffing boys,
pulling hair, making faces–in a word, using every art that seemed likely
to fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one
alloy–the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden–and that
record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that
were sweeping over it now.</p>
<p>The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as
Mr. Walters’ speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The
middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage–no less a one
than the county judge–altogether the most august creation these children
had ever looked upon–and they wondered what kind of material he was made
of–and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,
too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away–so he had travelled,
and seen the world–these very eyes had looked upon the county
court-house–which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these
reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of
their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar
with the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music
to his soul to hear the whisperings:</p>
<p>“Look at him, Jim! He’s a going up there. Say–look! he’s a going to
shake hands with him–he IS shaking hands with him! By jings, don’t you
wish you was Jeff?“</p>
<p>Mr. Walters fell to “showing off,“ with all sorts of official
bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments,
discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a
target. The librarian “showed off“–running hither and thither with his
arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that
insect authority delights in. The young lady teachers “showed off“
–bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting
pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones
lovingly. The young gentlemen teachers “showed off“ with small scoldings
and other little displays of authority and fine attention to
discipline–and most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at
the library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had to
be done over again two or three times (with much seeming vexation). The
little girls “showed off“ in various ways, and the little boys “showed
off“ with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the
murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat and beamed a
majestic judicial smile upon all the house, and warmed himself in the
sun of his own grandeur–for he was “showing off,“ too.</p>
<p>There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy
complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a
prodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough
–he had been around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given
worlds, now, to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.</p>
<p>And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward
with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and
demanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was
not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years.
But there was no getting around it–here were the certified checks, and
they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place
with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced
from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and
so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the
judicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in
place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy–but those that
suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they
themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to
Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.
These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a
guileful snake in the grass.</p>
<p>The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked
somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct taught him
that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,
perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises–a dozen would
strain his capacity, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in
her face–but he wouldn’t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain
troubled; next a dim suspicion came and went–came again; she watched; a
furtive glance told her worlds–and then her heart broke, and she was
jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most
of all (she thought).</p>
<p>Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath
would hardly come, his heart quaked–partly because of the awful
greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would
have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The
Judge put his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine little man, and
asked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it
out:</p>
<p>“Tom.“</p>
<p>“Oh, no, not Tom–it is–“</p>
<p>“Thomas.“</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That’s very
well. But you’ve another one I daresay, and you’ll tell it to me, won’t
you?“</p>
<p>“Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,“ said Walters, “and say
sir. You mustn’t forget your manners.“</p>
<p>“Thomas Sawyer–sir.“</p>
<p>“That’s it! That’s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow.
Two thousand verses is a great many–very, very great many. And you never
can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is
worth more than anything there is in the world; it’s what makes great
men and good men; you’ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some
day, Thomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s all owing to the
precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood–it’s all owing to my
dear teachers that taught me to learn–it’s all owing to the good
superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a
beautiful Bible–a splendid elegant Bible–to keep and have it all for my
own, always–it’s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will
say, Thomas–and you wouldn’t take any money for those two thousand
verses–no indeed you wouldn’t. And now you wouldn’t mind telling me and
this lady some of the things you’ve learned–no, I know you wouldn’t–for
we are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names
of all the twelve disciples. Won’t you tell us the names of the first
two that were appointed?“</p>
<p>Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,
now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. He said to
himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
question–why DID the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up and
say:</p>
<p>“Answer the gentleman, Thomas–don’t be afraid.“</p>
<p>Tom still hung fire.</p>
<p>“Now I know you’ll tell me,“ said the lady. “The names of the first
two disciples were–“</p>
<p>“DAVID AND GOLIAH!“</p>
<p>Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to
ring, and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon.
The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt
Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her–Tom being placed next
the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window
and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up
the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days; the
mayor and his wife–for they had a mayor there, among other
unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,
smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much
the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could
boast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the
new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by
a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all
the young clerks in town in a body–for they had stood in the vestibule
sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering
admirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came
the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as
if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was
the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so good.
And besides, he had been “thrown up to them“ so much. His white
handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on
Sundays–accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys
who had as snobs.</p>
<p>The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,
to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all
through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,
but I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,
and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in
some foreign country.</p>
<p>The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in
a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His
voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a
certain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word
and then plunged down as if from a spring-board:</p>
<p>Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry BEDS of ease,</p>
<p>Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ BLOODY seas?</p>
<p>He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables“ he was
always called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies
would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,
and “wall“ their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words
cannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal
earth.“</p>
<p>After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself
into a bulletin-board, and read off “notices“ of meetings and societies
and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack
of doom–a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in
cities, away here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less
there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of
it.</p>
<p>And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went
into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
church; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;
for the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United
States; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the
President; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed
by stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
European monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with a
supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and
favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
grateful harvest of good. Amen.</p>
<p>There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat
down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer,
he only endured it–if he even did that much. He was restive all through
it; he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously –for he
was not listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s
regular route over it–and when a little trifle of new matter was
interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he
considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer
a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his
spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its
arms, and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part
company with the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to
view; scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its
body as if they had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as
tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as
sorely as Tom’s hands itched to grab for it they did not dare–he
believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing
while the prayer was going on. But with the closing sentence his hand
began to curve and steal forward; and the instant the “Amen“ was out the
fly was a prisoner of war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it
go.</p>
<p>The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through
an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod
–and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone
and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be
hardly worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after
church he always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew
anything else about the discourse. However, this time he was really
interested for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving
picture of the assembling together of the world’s hosts at the
millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a
little child should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of
the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the
conspicuousness of the principal character before the on-looking
nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to himself that he
wished he could be that child, if it was a tame lion.</p>
<p>Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.
Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a
large black beetle with formidable jaws–a “pinchbug,“ he called it. It
was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to take
him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went
floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went
into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,
unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out
of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in
the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came
idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the quiet,
weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the
drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around
it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew
bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy
the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,
and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent
and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin
descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,
a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards
away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators shook
with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and
handkerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and
probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a
craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on
it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his
fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at
it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But
he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a
fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to
the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the
beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony
and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so
did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down
the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the
home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was
but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of
light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang
into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of
distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.</p>
<p>By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. The
discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all
possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest
sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson
had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole
congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction
pronounced.</p>
<p>Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there
was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of
variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the
dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright
in him to carry it off.</p>
