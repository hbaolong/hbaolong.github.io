<h4 id="chapter-59-legends-and-scenery">Chapter 59 Legends and
Scenery</h4>
<p>WE added several passengers to our list, at La Crosse; among others
an old gentleman who had come to this north-western region with the
early settlers, and was familiar with every part of it. Pardonably proud
of it, too. He said–</p>
<p>‘You’ll find scenery between here and St. Paul that can give the
Hudson points. You’ll have the Queen’s Bluff–seven hundred feet high,
and just as imposing a spectacle as you can find anywheres; and
Trempeleau Island, which isn’t like any other island in America, I
believe, for it is a gigantic mountain, with precipitous sides, and is
full of Indian traditions, and used to be full of rattlesnakes; if you
catch the sun just right there, you will have a picture that will stay
with you. And above Winona you’ll have lovely prairies; and then come
the Thousand Islands, too beautiful for anything; green? why you never
saw foliage so green, nor packed so thick; it’s like a thousand plush
cushions afloat on a looking-glass–when the water ’s still; and then the
monstrous bluffs on both sides of the river–ragged, rugged,
dark-complected–just the frame that’s wanted; you always want a strong
frame, you know, to throw up the nice points of a delicate picture and
make them stand out.’</p>
<p>The old gentleman also told us a touching Indian legend or two–but
not very powerful ones.</p>
<p>After this excursion into history, he came back to the scenery, and
described it, detail by detail, from the Thousand Islands to St. Paul;
naming its names with such facility, tripping along his theme with such
nimble and confident ease, slamming in a three-ton word, here and there,
with such a complacent air of ’t isn’t-anything,-I-can-do-it-any-time-I-
want-to, and letting off fine surprises of lurid eloquence at such
judicious intervals, that I presently began to suspect–</p>
<p>But no matter what I began to suspect. Hear him–</p>
<p>‘Ten miles above Winona we come to Fountain City, nestling sweetly at
the feet of cliffs that lift their awful fronts, Jovelike, toward the
blue depths of heaven, bathing them in virgin atmospheres that have
known no other contact save that of angels’ wings.</p>
<p>’And next we glide through silver waters, amid lovely and stupendous
aspects of nature that attune our hearts to adoring admiration, about
twelve miles, and strike Mount Vernon, six hundred feet high, with
romantic ruins of a once first-class hotel perched far among the cloud
shadows that mottle its dizzy heights–sole remnant of once-flourishing
Mount Vernon, town of early days, now desolate and utterly deserted.</p>
<p>’And so we move on. Past Chimney Rock we fly–noble shaft of six
hundred feet; then just before landing at Minnieska our attention is
attracted by a most striking promontory rising over five hundred feet–
the ideal mountain pyramid. Its conic shape–thickly-wooded surface
girding its sides, and its apex like that of a cone, cause the spectator
to wonder at nature’s workings. From its dizzy heights superb views of
the forests, streams, bluffs, hills and dales below and beyond for miles
are brought within its focus. What grander river scenery can be
conceived, as we gaze upon this enchanting landscape, from the uppermost
point of these bluffs upon the valleys below? The primeval wildness and
awful loneliness of these sublime creations of nature and nature’s God,
excite feelings of unbounded admiration, and the recollection of which
can never be effaced from the memory, as we view them in any
direction.</p>
<p>’Next we have the Lion’s Head and the Lioness’s Head, carved by
nature’s hand, to adorn and dominate the beauteous stream; and then anon
the river widens, and a most charming and magnificent view of the valley
before us suddenly bursts upon our vision; rugged hills, clad with
verdant forests from summit to base, level prairie lands, holding in
their lap the beautiful Wabasha, City of the Healing Waters, puissant
foe of Bright’s disease, and that grandest conception of nature’s works,
incomparable Lake Pepin–these constitute a picture whereon the tourist’s
eye may gaze uncounted hours, with rapture unappeased and
unappeasable.</p>
<p>’And so we glide along; in due time encountering those majestic
domes, the mighty Sugar Loaf, and the sublime Maiden’s Rock–which
latter, romantic superstition has invested with a voice; and oft-times
as the birch canoe glides near, at twilight, the dusky paddler fancies
he hears the soft sweet music of the long-departed Winona, darling of
Indian song and story.</p>
<p>‘Then Frontenac looms upon our vision, delightful resort of jaded
summer tourists; then progressive Red Wing; and Diamond Bluff,
impressive and preponderous in its lone sublimity; then Prescott and the
St. Croix; and anon we see bursting upon us the domes and steeples of
St. Paul, giant young chief of the North, marching with seven-league
stride in the van of progress, banner-bearer of the highest and newest
civilization, carving his beneficent way with the tomahawk of commercial
enterprise, sounding the warwhoop of Christian culture, tearing off the
reeking scalp of sloth and superstition to plant there the steam-plow
and the school-house–ever in his front stretch arid lawlessness,
ignorance, crime, despair; ever in his wake bloom the jail, the gallows,
and the pulpit; and ever–’</p>
<p>‘Have you ever traveled with a panorama?’</p>
<p>‘I have formerly served in that capacity.’</p>
<p>My suspicion was confirmed.</p>
<p>‘Do you still travel with it?’</p>
<p>‘No, she is laid up till the fall season opens. I am helping now to
work up the materials for a Tourist’s Guide which the St. Louis and
St. Paul Packet Company are going to issue this summer for the benefit
of travelers who go by that line.’</p>
<p>‘When you were talking of Maiden’s Rock, you spoke of the
long-departed Winona, darling of Indian song and story. Is she the
maiden of the rock?–and are the two connected by legend?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, and a very tragic and painful one. Perhaps the most celebrated,
as well as the most pathetic, of all the legends of the
Mississippi.’</p>
<p>We asked him to tell it. He dropped out of his conversational vein
and back into his lecture-gait without an effort, and rolled on as
follows–</p>
<p>‘A little distance above Lake City is a famous point known as
Maiden’s Rock, which is not only a picturesque spot, but is full of
romantic interest from the event which gave it its name, Not many years
ago this locality was a favorite resort for the Sioux Indians on account
of the fine fishing and hunting to be had there, and large numbers of
them were always to be found in this locality. Among the families which
used to resort here, was one belonging to the tribe of Wabasha. We-no-na
(first-born) was the name of a maiden who had plighted her troth to a
lover belonging to the same band. But her stern parents had promised her
hand to another, a famous warrior, and insisted on her wedding him. The
day was fixed by her parents, to her great grief. She appeared to accede
to the proposal and accompany them to the rock, for the purpose of
gathering flowers for the feast. On reaching the rock, We-no-na ran to
its summit and standing on its edge upbraided her parents who were
below, for their cruelty, and then singing a death-dirge, threw herself
from the precipice and dashed them in pieces on the rock below.’</p>
<p>‘Dashed who in pieces–her parents?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘Well, it certainly was a tragic business, as you say. And moreover,
there is a startling kind of dramatic surprise about it which I was not
looking for. It is a distinct improvement upon the threadbare form of
Indian legend. There are fifty Lover’s Leaps along the Mississippi from
whose summit disappointed Indian girls have jumped, but this is the only
jump in the lot hat turned out in the right and satisfactory way. What
became of Winona?’</p>
<p>‘She was a good deal jarred up and jolted: but she got herself
together and disappeared before the coroner reached the fatal spot; and
’tis said she sought and married her true love, and wandered with him to
some distant clime, where she lived happy ever after, her gentle spirit
mellowed and chastened by the romantic incident which had so early
deprived her of the sweet guidance of a mother’s love and a father’s
protecting arm, and thrown her, all unfriended, upon the cold charity of
a censorious world.’</p>
<p>I was glad to hear the lecturer’s description of the scenery, for it
assisted my appreciation of what I saw of it, and enabled me to imagine
such of it as we lost by the intrusion of night.</p>
<p>As the lecturer remarked, this whole region is blanketed with Indian
tales and traditions. But I reminded him that people usually merely
mention this fact–doing it in a way to make a body’s mouth water–and
judiciously stopped there. Why? Because the impression left, was that
these tales were full of incident and imagination–a pleasant impression
which would be promptly dissipated if the tales were told. I showed him
a lot of this sort of literature which I had been collecting, and he
confessed that it was poor stuff, exceedingly sorry rubbish; and I
ventured to add that the legends which he had himself told us were of
this character, with the single exception of the admirable story of
Winona. He granted these facts, but said that if I would hunt up
Mr. Schoolcraft’s book, published near fifty years ago, and now
doubtless out of print, I would find some Indian inventions in it that
were very far from being barren of incident and imagination; that the
tales in Hiawatha were of this sort, and they came from Schoolcraft’s
book; and that there were others in the same book which Mr. Longfellow
could have turned into verse with good effect. For instance, there was
the legend of ‘The Undying Head.’ He could not tell it, for many of the
details had grown dim in his memory; but he would recommend me to find
it and enlarge my respect for the Indian imagination. He said that this
tale, and most of the others in the book, were current among the Indians
along this part of the Mississippi when he first came here; and that the
contributors to Schoolcraft’s book had got them directly from Indian
lips, and had written them down with strict exactness, and without
embellishments of their own.</p>
<p>I have found the book. The lecturer was right. There are several
legends in it which confirm what he said. I will offer two of them– ‘The
Undying Head,’ and ‘Peboan and Seegwun, an Allegory of the Seasons.’ The
latter is used in Hiawatha; but it is worth reading in the original
form, if only that one may see how effective a genuine poem can be
without the helps and graces of poetic measure and rhythm–</p>
<p>PEBOAN AND SEEGWUN.</p>
<p>An old man was sitting alone in his lodge, by the side of a frozen
stream. It was the close of winter, and his fire was almost out, He
appeared very old and very desolate. His locks were white with age, and
he trembled in every joint. Day after day passed in solitude, and he
heard nothing but the sound of the tempest, sweeping before it the new-
fallen snow.</p>
<p>One day, as his fire was just dying, a handsome young man approached
and entered his dwelling. His cheeks were red with the blood of youth,
his eyes sparkled with animation, and a smile played upon his lips. He
walked with a light and quick step. His forehead was bound with a wreath
of sweet grass, in place of a warrior’s frontlet, and he carried a bunch
of flowers in his hand.</p>
<p>‘Ah, my son,’ said the old man, ‘I am happy to see you. Come in. Come
and tell me of your adventures, and what strange lands you have been to
see. Let us pass the night together. I will tell you of my prowess and
exploits, and what I can perform. You shall do the same, and we will
amuse ourselves.’</p>
<p>He then drew from his sack a curiously wrought antique pipe, and
having filled it with tobacco, rendered mild by a mixture of certain
leaves, handed it to his guest. When this ceremony was concluded they
began to speak.</p>
<p>‘I blow my breath,’ said the old man, ‘and the stream stands still.
The water becomes stiff and hard as clear stone.’</p>
<p>‘I breathe,’ said the young man, ‘and flowers spring up over the
plain.’</p>
<p>‘I shake my locks,’ retorted the old man, ‘and snow covers the land.
The leaves fall from the trees at my command, and my breath blows them
away. The birds get up from the water, and fly to a distant land. The
animals hide themselves from my breath, and the very ground becomes as
hard as flint.’</p>
<p>‘I shake my ringlets,’ rejoined the young man, ‘and warm showers of
soft rain fall upon the earth. The plants lift up their heads out of the
earth, like the eyes of children glistening with delight. My voice
recalls the birds. The warmth of my breath unlocks the streams. Music
fills the groves wherever I walk, and all nature rejoices.’</p>
<p>At length the sun began to rise. A gentle warmth came over the place.
The tongue of the old man became silent. The robin and bluebird began to
sing on the top of the lodge. The stream began to murmur by the door,
and the fragrance of growing herbs and flowers came softly on the vernal
breeze.</p>
<p>Daylight fully revealed to the young man the character of his
entertainer. When he looked upon him, he had the icy visage of
Peboan.{footnote [Winter.]} Streams began to flow from his eyes. As the
sun increased, he grew less and less in stature, and anon had melted
completely away. Nothing remained on the place of his lodge-fire but the
miskodeed,{footnote [The trailing arbutus.]} a small white flower, with
a pink border, which is one of the earliest species of northern
plants.</p>
<p>‘The Undying Head’ is a rather long tale, but it makes up in weird
conceits, fairy-tale prodigies, variety of incident, and energy of
movement, for what it lacks in brevity.{footnote [See appendix D.]}</p>
