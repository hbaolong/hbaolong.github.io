<h4 id="chapter-xxxiii.">CHAPTER XXXIII.</h4>
<p>Laura soon discovered that there were three distinct aristocracies in
Washington. One of these, (nick-named the Antiques,) consisted of
cultivated, high-bred old families who looked back with pride upon an
ancestry that had been always great in the nation’s councils and its
wars from the birth of the republic downward. Into this select circle it
was difficult to gain admission. No. 2 was the aristocracy of the middle
ground–of which, more anon. No. 3 lay beyond; of it we will say a word
here. We will call it the Aristocracy of the Parvenus–as, indeed, the
general public did. Official position, no matter how obtained, entitled
a man to a place in it, and carried his family with him, no matter
whence they sprang. Great wealth gave a man a still higher and nobler
place in it than did official position. If this wealth had been acquired
by conspicuous ingenuity, with just a pleasant little spice of
illegality about it, all the better. This aristocracy was “fast,“ and
not averse to ostentation.</p>
<p>The aristocracy of the Antiques ignored the aristocracy of the
Parvenus; the Parvenus laughed at the Antiques, (and secretly envied
them.)</p>
<p>There were certain important “society“ customs which one in Laura’s
position needed to understand. For instance, when a lady of any
prominence comes to one of our cities and takes up her residence, all
the ladies of her grade favor her in turn with an initial call, giving
their cards to the servant at the door by way of introduction. They come
singly, sometimes; sometimes in couples; and always in elaborate full
dress. They talk two minutes and a quarter and then go. If the lady
receiving the call desires a further acquaintance, she must return the
visit within two weeks; to neglect it beyond that time means “let the
matter drop.“ But if she does return the visit within two weeks, it then
becomes the other party’s privilege to continue the acquaintance or drop
it. She signifies her willingness to continue it by calling again any
time within twelve-months; after that, if the parties go on calling upon
each other once a year, in our large cities, that is sufficient, and the
acquaintanceship holds good. The thing goes along smoothly, now. The
annual visits are made and returned with peaceful regularity and bland
satisfaction, although it is not necessary that the two ladies shall
actually see each other oftener than once every few years. Their cards
preserve the intimacy and keep the acquaintanceship intact.</p>
<p>For instance, Mrs. A. pays her annual visit, sits in her carriage and
sends in her card with the lower right hand corner turned down, which
signifies that she has “called in person;“ Mrs. B: sends down word that
she is “engaged“ or “wishes to be excused“–or if she is a Parvenu and
low-bred, she perhaps sends word that she is “not at home.“ Very good;
Mrs. A. drives, on happy and content. If Mrs. A.’s daughter marries, or
a child is born to the family, Mrs. B. calls, sends in her card with the
upper left hand corner turned down, and then goes along about her
affairs–for that inverted corner means “Congratulations.“ If Mrs. B.’s
husband falls downstairs and breaks his neck, Mrs. A. calls, leaves her
card with the upper right hand corner turned down, and then takes her
departure; this corner means “Condolence.“ It is very necessary to get
the corners right, else one may unintentionally condole with a friend on
a wedding or congratulate her upon a funeral. If either lady is about to
leave the city, she goes to the other’s house and leaves her card with
“P. P. C.“ engraved under the name–which signifies, “Pay Parting Call.“
But enough of etiquette. Laura was early instructed in the mysteries of
society life by a competent mentor, and thus was preserved from
troublesome mistakes.</p>
<p>The first fashionable call she received from a member of the ancient
nobility, otherwise the Antiques, was of a pattern with all she received
from that limb of the aristocracy afterward. This call was paid by
Mrs. Major-General Fulke-Fulkerson and daughter. They drove up at one in
the afternoon in a rather antiquated vehicle with a faded coat of arms
on the panels, an aged white-wooled negro coachman on the box and a
younger darkey beside him–the footman. Both of these servants were
dressed in dull brown livery that had seen considerable service.</p>
<p>The ladies entered the drawing-room in full character; that is to
say, with Elizabethan stateliness on the part of the dowager, and an
easy grace and dignity on the part of the young lady that had a nameless
something about it that suggested conscious superiority. The dresses of
both ladies were exceedingly rich, as to material, but as notably modest
as to color and ornament. All parties having seated themselves, the
dowager delivered herself of a remark that was not unusual in its form,
and yet it came from her lips with the impressiveness of Scripture:</p>
<p>“The weather has been unpropitious of late, Miss Hawkins.“</p>
<p>“It has indeed,“ said Laura. “The climate seems to be variable.“</p>
<p>“It is its nature of old, here,“ said the daughter–stating it
apparently as a fact, only, and by her manner waving aside all personal
responsibility on account of it. “Is it not so, mamma?“</p>
<p>“Quite so, my child. Do you like winter, Miss Hawkins?“ She said
“like“ as if she had, an idea that its dictionary meaning was “approve
of.“</p>
<p>“Not as well as summer–though I think all seasons have their
charms.“</p>
<p>“It is a very just remark. The general held similar views. He
considered snow in winter proper; sultriness in summer legitimate;
frosts in the autumn the same, and rains in spring not objectionable. He
was not an exacting man. And I call to mind now that he always admired
thunder. You remember, child, your father always admired thunder?“</p>
<p>“He adored it.“</p>
<p>“No doubt it reminded him of battle,“ said Laura.</p>
<p>“Yes, I think perhaps it did. He had a great respect for Nature. He
often said there was something striking about the ocean. You remember
his saying that, daughter?“</p>
<p>“Yes, often, Mother. I remember it very well.“</p>
<p>“And hurricanes… He took a great interest in hurricanes. And animals.
Dogs, especially–hunting dogs. Also comets. I think we all have our
predilections. I think it is this that gives variety to our tastes.“</p>
<p>Laura coincided with this view.</p>
<p>“Do you find it hard and lonely to be so far from your home and
friends, Miss Hawkins?“</p>
<p>“I do find it depressing sometimes, but then there is so much about
me here that is novel and interesting that my days are made up more of
sunshine than shadow.“</p>
<p>“Washington is not a dull city in the season,“ said the young lady.
“We have some very good society indeed, and one need not be at a loss
for means to pass the time pleasantly. Are you fond of watering-places,
Miss Hawkins?“</p>
<p>“I have really had no experience of them, but I have always felt a
strong desire to see something of fashionable watering-place life.“</p>
<p>“We of Washington are unfortunately situated in that respect,“ said
the dowager. “It is a tedious distance to Newport. But there is no help
for it.“</p>
<p>Laura said to herself, “Long Branch and Cape May are nearer than
Newport; doubtless these places are low; I’ll feel my way a little and
see.“ Then she said aloud:</p>
<p>“Why I thought that Long Branch–“</p>
<p>There was no need to “feel“ any further–there was that in both faces
before her which made that truth apparent. The dowager said:</p>
<p>“Nobody goes there, Miss Hawkins–at least only persons of no position
in society. And the President.“ She added that with tranquility.</p>
<p>“Newport is damp, and cold, and windy and excessively disagreeable,“
said the daughter, “but it is very select. One cannot be fastidious
about minor matters when one has no choice.“</p>
<p>The visit had spun out nearly three minutes, now. Both ladies rose
with grave dignity, conferred upon Laura a formal invitation to call,
aid then retired from the conference. Laura remained in the drawing-room
and left them to pilot themselves out of the house–an inhospitable
thing, it seemed to her, but then she was following her instructions.
She stood, steeped in reverie, a while, and then she said:</p>
<p>“I think I could always enjoy icebergs–as scenery but not as
company.“</p>
<p>Still, she knew these two people by reputation, and was aware that
they were not ice-bergs when they were in their own waters and amid
their legitimate surroundings, but on the contrary were people to be
respected for their stainless characters and esteemed for their social
virtues and their benevolent impulses. She thought it a pity that they
had to be such changed and dreary creatures on occasions of state.</p>
<p>The first call Laura received from the other extremity of the
Washington aristocracy followed close upon the heels of the one we have
just been describing. The callers this time were the Hon. Mrs. Oliver
Higgins, the Hon. Mrs. Patrique Oreille (pronounced O-relay,) Miss
Bridget (pronounced Breezhay) Oreille, Mrs. Peter Gashly, Miss Gashly,
and Miss Emmeline Gashly.</p>
<p>The three carriages arrived at the same moment from different
directions. They were new and wonderfully shiny, and the brasses on the
harness were highly polished and bore complicated monograms. There were
showy coats of arms, too, with Latin mottoes. The coachmen and footmen
were clad in bright new livery, of striking colors, and they had black
rosettes with shaving-brushes projecting above them, on the sides of
their stove-pipe hats.</p>
<p>When the visitors swept into the drawing-room they filled the place
with a suffocating sweetness procured at the perfumer’s. Their costumes,
as to architecture, were the latest fashion intensified; they were
rainbow-hued; they were hung with jewels–chiefly diamonds. It would have
been plain to any eye that it had cost something to upholster these
women.</p>
<p>The Hon. Mrs. Oliver Higgins was the wife of a delegate from a
distant territory–a gentleman who had kept the principal “saloon,“ and
sold the best whiskey in the principal village in his wilderness, and
so, of course, was recognized as the first man of his commonwealth and
its fittest representative.</p>
<p>He was a man of paramount influence at home, for he was public
spirited, he was chief of the fire department, he had an admirable
command of profane language, and had killed several “parties.“ His shirt
fronts were always immaculate; his boots daintily polished, and no man
could lift a foot and fire a dead shot at a stray speck of dirt on it
with a white handkerchief with a finer grace than he; his watch chain
weighed a pound; the gold in his finger ring was worth forty five
dollars; he wore a diamond cluster-pin and he parted his hair behind. He
had always been, regarded as the most elegant gentleman in his
territory, and it was conceded by all that no man thereabouts was
anywhere near his equal in the telling of an obscene story except the
venerable white-haired governor himself. The Hon. Higgins had not come
to serve his country in Washington for nothing. The appropriation which
he had engineered through Congress for the maintenance, of the Indians
in his Territory would have made all those savages rich if it had ever
got to them.</p>
<p>The Hon. Mrs. Higgins was a picturesque woman, and a fluent talker,
and she held a tolerably high station among the Parvenus. Her English
was fair enough, as a general thing–though, being of New York origin,
she had the fashion peculiar to many natives of that city of pronouncing
saw and law as if they were spelt sawr and lawr.</p>
<p>Petroleum was the agent that had suddenly transformed the Gashlys
from modest hard-working country village folk into “loud“ aristocrats
and ornaments of the city.</p>
<p>The Hon. Patrique Oreille was a wealthy Frenchman from Cork. Not that
he was wealthy when he first came from Cork, but just the reverse. When
he first landed in New York with his wife, he had only halted at Castle
Garden for a few minutes to receive and exhibit papers showing that he
had resided in this country two years–and then he voted the democratic
ticket and went up town to hunt a house. He found one and then went to
work as assistant to an architect and builder, carrying a hod all day
and studying politics evenings. Industry and economy soon enabled him to
start a low rum shop in a foul locality, and this gave him political
influence. In our country it is always our first care to see that our
people have the opportunity of voting for their choice of men to
represent and govern them–we do not permit our great officials to
appoint the little officials. We prefer to have so tremendous a power as
that in our own hands. We hold it safest to elect our judges and
everybody else. In our cities, the ward meetings elect delegates to the
nominating conventions and instruct them whom to nominate. The publicans
and their retainers rule the ward meetings (for every body else hates
the worry of politics and stays at home); the delegates from the ward
meetings organize as a nominating convention and make up a list of
candidates–one convention offering a democratic and another a republican
list of incorruptibles; and then the great meek public come forward at
the proper time and make unhampered choice and bless Heaven that they
live in a free land where no form of despotism can ever intrude.</p>
<p>Patrick O’Riley (as his name then stood) created friends and
influence very, fast, for he was always on hand at the police courts to
give straw bail for his customers or establish an alibi for them in case
they had been beating anybody to death on his premises. Consequently he
presently became a political leader, and was elected to a petty office
under the city government. Out of a meager salary he soon saved money
enough to open quite a stylish liquor saloon higher up town, with a faro
bank attached and plenty of capital to conduct it with. This gave him
fame and great respectability. The position of alderman was forced upon
him, and it was just the same as presenting him a gold mine. He had fine
horses and carriages, now, and closed up his whiskey mill.</p>
<p>By and by he became a large contractor for city work, and was a bosom
friend of the great and good Wm. M. Weed himself, who had stolen
0,600,000 from the city and was a man so envied, so honored,–so adored,
indeed, that when the sheriff went to his office to arrest him as a
felon, that sheriff blushed and apologized, and one of the illustrated
papers made a picture of the scene and spoke of the matter in such a way
as to show that the editor regretted that the offense of an arrest had
been offered to so exalted a personage as Mr. Weed.</p>
<p>Mr. O’Riley furnished shingle nails to, the new Court House at three
thousand dollars a keg, and eighteen gross of 60-cent thermometers at
fifteen hundred dollars a dozen; the controller and the board of audit
passed the bills, and a mayor, who was simply ignorant but not criminal,
signed them. When they were paid, Mr. O’Riley’s admirers gave him a
solitaire diamond pin of the size of a filbert, in imitation of the
liberality of Mr. Weed’s friends, and then Mr. O’Riley retired from
active service and amused himself with buying real estate at enormous
figures and holding it in other people’s names. By and by the newspapers
came out with exposures and called Weed and O’Riley “thieves,“–whereupon
the people rose as one man (voting repeatedly) and elected the two
gentlemen to their proper theatre of action, the New York legislature.
The newspapers clamored, and the courts proceeded to try the new
legislators for their small irregularities. Our admirable jury system
enabled the persecuted ex-officials to secure a jury of nine gentlemen
from a neighboring asylum and three graduates from Sing-Sing, and
presently they walked forth with characters vindicated. The legislature
was called upon to spew them forth–a thing which the legislature
declined to do. It was like asking children to repudiate their own
father. It was a legislature of the modern pattern.</p>
<p>Being now wealthy and distinguished, Mr. O’Riley, still bearing the
legislative “Hon.“ attached to his name (for titles never die in
America, although we do take a republican pride in poking fun at such
trifles), sailed for Europe with his family. They traveled all about,
turning their noses up at every thing, and not finding it a difficult
thing to do, either, because nature had originally given those features
a cast in that direction; and finally they established themselves in
Paris, that Paradise of Americans of their sort.–They staid there two
years and learned to speak English with a foreign accent–not that it
hadn’t always had a foreign accent (which was indeed the case) but now
the nature of it was changed. Finally they returned home and became
ultra fashionables. They landed here as the Hon. Patrique Oreille and
family, and so are known unto this day.</p>
<p>Laura provided seats for her visitors and they immediately launched
forth into a breezy, sparkling conversation with that easy confidence
which is to be found only among persons accustomed to high life.</p>
<p>“I’ve been intending to call sooner, Miss Hawkins,“ said the
Hon. Mrs. Oreille, “but the weather’s been so horrid. How do you like
Washington?“</p>
<p>Laura liked it very well indeed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gashly–“Is it your first visit?“</p>
<p>Yea, it was her first.</p>
<p>All–“Indeed?“</p>
<p>Mrs. Oreille–“I’m afraid you’ll despise the weather, Miss Hawkins.
It’s perfectly awful. It always is. I tell Mr. Oreille I can’t and I
won’t put up with any such a climate. If we were obliged to do it, I
wouldn’t mind it; but we are not obliged to, and so I don’t see the use
of it. Sometimes its real pitiful the way the childern pine for Parry
–don’t look so sad, Bridget, ‘ma chere’–poor child, she can’t hear Parry
mentioned without getting the blues.“</p>
<p>Mrs. Gashly–“Well I should think so, Mrs. Oreille. A body lives in
Paris, but a body, only stays here. I dote on Paris; I’d druther scrimp
along on ten thousand dollars a year there, than suffer and worry here
on a real decent income.“</p>
<p>Miss Gashly–“Well then, I wish you’d take us back, mother; I’m sure I
hate this stoopid country enough, even if it is our dear native
land.“</p>
<p>Miss Emmeline Gashly–“What and leave poor Johnny Peterson behind?“
[An airy genial laugh applauded this sally].</p>
<p>Miss Gashly–“Sister, I should think you’d be ashamed of
yourself!“</p>
<p>Miss Emmeline–“Oh, you needn’t ruffle your feathers so: I was only
joking. He don’t mean anything by coming to, the house every evening
–only comes to see mother. Of course that’s all!“ [General
laughter].</p>
<p>Miss G. prettily confused–“Emmeline, how can you!“</p>
<p>Mrs. G.–“Let your sister alone, Emmeline. I never saw such a
tease!“</p>
<p>Mrs. Oreille–“What lovely corals you have, Miss Hawkins! Just look at
them, Bridget, dear. I’ve a great passion for corals–it’s a pity they’re
getting a little common. I have some elegant ones–not as elegant as
yours, though–but of course I don’t wear them now.“</p>
<p>Laura–“I suppose they are rather common, but still I have a great
affection for these, because they were given to me by a dear old friend
of our family named Murphy. He was a very charming man, but very
eccentric. We always supposed he was an Irishman, but after be got rich
he went abroad for a year or two, and when he came back you would have
been amused to see how interested he was in a potato. He asked what it
was! Now you know that when Providence shapes a mouth especially for the
accommodation of a potato you can detect that fact at a glance when that
mouth is in repose–foreign travel can never remove that sign. But he was
a very delightful gentleman, and his little foible did not hurt him at
all. We all have our shams–I suppose there is a sham somewhere about
every individual, if we could manage to ferret it out. I would so like
to go to France. I suppose our society here compares very favorably with
French society does it not, Mrs. Oreille?“</p>
<p>Mrs. O.–“Not by any means, Miss Hawkins! French society is much more
elegant–much more so.“</p>
<p>Laura–“I am sorry to hear that. I suppose ours has deteriorated of
late.“</p>
<p>Mrs. O.–“Very much indeed. There are people in society here that have
really no more money to live on than what some of us pay for servant
hire. Still I won’t say but what some of them are very good people–and
respectable, too.“</p>
<p>Laura–“The old families seem to be holding themselves aloof, from
what I hear. I suppose you seldom meet in society now, the people you
used to be familiar with twelve or fifteen years ago?“</p>
<p>Mrs. O.–“Oh, no-hardly ever.“</p>
<p>Mr. O’Riley kept his first rum-mill and protected his customers from
the law in those days, and this turn of the conversation was rather
uncomfortable to madame than otherwise.</p>
<p>Hon. Mrs. Higgins–“Is Francois’ health good now, Mrs. Oreille?“</p>
<p>Mrs. O.–(Thankful for the intervention)–“Not very. A body couldn’t
expect it. He was always delicate–especially his lungs–and this odious
climate tells on him strong, now, after Parry, which is so mild.“</p>
<p>Mrs. H:–“I should think so. Husband says Percy’ll die if he don’t
have a change; and so I’m going to swap round a little and see what can
be done. I saw a lady from Florida last week, and she recommended Key
West. I told her Percy couldn’t abide winds, as he was threatened with a
pulmonary affection, and then she said try St. Augustine. It’s an awful
distance–ten or twelve hundred mile, they say but then in a case of this
kind–a body can’t stand back for trouble, you know.“</p>
<p>Mrs. O.–“No, of course that’s off. If Francois don’t get better soon
we’ve got to look out for some other place, or else Europe. We’ve
thought some of the Hot Springs, but I don’t know. It’s a great
responsibility and a body wants to go cautious. Is Hildebrand about
again, Mrs. Gashly?“</p>
<p>Mrs. G.–“Yes, but that’s about all. It was indigestion, you know, and
it looks as if it was chronic. And you know I do dread dyspepsia. We’ve
all been worried a good deal about him. The doctor recommended baked
apple and spoiled meat, and I think it done him good. It’s about the
only thing that will stay on his stomach now-a-days. We have Dr. Shovel
now. Who’s your doctor, Mrs. Higgins?“</p>
<p>Mrs. H.–“Well, we had Dr. Spooner a good while, but he runs so much
to emetics, which I think are weakening, that we changed off and took
Dr. Leathers. We like him very much. He has a fine European reputation,
too. The first thing he suggested for Percy was to have him taken out in
the back yard for an airing, every afternoon, with nothing at all
on.“</p>
<p>Mrs. O. and Mrs. G.–“What!“</p>
<p>Mrs. H.–“As true as I’m sitting here. And it actually helped him for
two or three days; it did indeed. But after that the doctor said it
seemed to be too severe and so he has fell back on hot foot-baths at
night and cold showers in the morning. But I don’t think there, can be
any good sound help for him in such a climate as this. I believe we are
going to lose him if we don’t make a change.“</p>
<p>Mrs. O. “I suppose you heard of the fright we had two weeks ago last
Saturday? No? Why that is strange–but come to remember, you’ve all been
away to Richmond. Francois tumbled from the sky light–in the
second-story hall clean down to the first floor–“</p>
<p>Everybody–“Mercy!“</p>
<p>Mrs. O.–“Yes indeed–and broke two of his ribs–“</p>
<p>Everybody–“What!“</p>
<p>Mrs. O. “Just as true as you live. First we thought he must be
injured internally. It was fifteen minutes past 8 in the evening. Of
course we were all distracted in a moment–everybody was flying
everywhere, and nobody doing anything worth anything. By and by I flung
out next door and dragged in Dr. Sprague; President of the Medical
University no time to go for our own doctor of course–and the minute he
saw Francois he said, ‘Send for your own physician, madam;’ said it as
cross as a bear, too, and turned right on his heel, and cleared out
without doing a thing!“</p>
<p>Everybody–“The mean, contemptible brute!“</p>
<p>Mrs. O–“Well you may say it. I was nearly out of my wits by this
time. But we hurried off the servants after our own doctor and
telegraphed mother–she was in New York and rushed down on the first
train; and when the doctor got there, lo and behold you he found
Francois had broke one of his legs, too!“</p>
<p>Everybody–“Goodness!“</p>
<p>Mrs. O.–“Yes. So he set his leg and bandaged it up, and fixed his
ribs and gave him a dose of something to quiet down his excitement and
put him to sleep–poor thing he was trembling and frightened to death and
it was pitiful to see him. We had him in my bed–Mr. Oreille slept in the
guest room and I laid down beside Francois–but not to sleep bless you
no. Bridget and I set up all night, and the doctor staid till two in the
morning, bless his old heart.–When mother got there she was so used up
with anxiety, that she had to go to bed and have the doctor; but when
she found that Francois was not in immediate danger she rallied, and by
night she was able to take a watch herself. Well for three days and
nights we three never left that bedside only to take an hour’s nap at a
time. And then the doctor said Francois was out of danger and if ever
there was a thankful set, in this world, it was us.“</p>
<p>Laura’s respect for these, women had augmented during this
conversation, naturally enough; affection and devotion are qualities
that are able to adorn and render beautiful a character that is
otherwise unattractive, and even repulsive.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gashly–“I do believe I would a died if I had been in your place,
Mrs. Oreille. The time Hildebrand was so low with the pneumonia Emmeline
and me were all, alone with him most of the time and we never took a
minute’s sleep for as much as two days, and nights. It was at Newport
and we wouldn’t trust hired nurses. One afternoon he had a fit, and
jumped up and run out on the portico of the hotel with nothing in the
world on and the wind a blowing liken ice and we after him scared to
death; and when the ladies and gentlemen saw that he had a fit, every
lady scattered for her room and not a gentleman lifted his hand to help,
the wretches! Well after that his life hung by a thread for as much as
ten days, and the minute he was out of danger Emmeline and me just went
to bed sick and worn out. I never want to pass through such a time
again. Poor dear Francois–which leg did he break, Mrs. Oreille!“</p>
<p>Mrs. O.–“It was his right hand hind leg. Jump down, Francois dear,
and show the ladies what a cruel limp you’ve got yet.“</p>
<p>Francois demurred, but being coaxed and delivered gently upon the
floor, he performed very satisfactorily, with his “right hand hind leg“
in the air. All were affected–even Laura–but hers was an affection of
the stomach. The country-bred girl had not suspected that the little
whining ten-ounce black and tan reptile, clad in a red embroidered pigmy
blanket and reposing in Mrs. Oreille’s lap all through the visit was the
individual whose sufferings had been stirring the dormant generosities
of her nature. She said:</p>
<p>“Poor little creature! You might have lost him!“</p>
<p>Mrs. O.–“O pray don’t mention it, Miss Hawkins–it gives me such a
turn!“</p>
<p>Laura–“And Hildebrand and Percy–are they-are they like this one?“</p>
<p>Mrs. G.–“No, Hilly has considerable Skye blood in him, I
believe.“</p>
<p>Mrs. H.–“Percy’s the same, only he is two months and ten days older
and has his ears cropped. His father, Martin Farquhar Tupper, was
sickly, and died young, but he was the sweetest disposition.–His mother
had heart disease but was very gentle and resigned, and a wonderful
ratter.“ –[** As impossible and exasperating as this conversation may
sound to a person who is not an idiot, it is scarcely in any respect an
exaggeration of one which one of us actually listened to in an American
drawing room –otherwise we could not venture to put such a chapter into
a book which, professes to deal with social possibilities.–THE
AUTHORS.]</p>
<p>So carried away had the visitors become by their interest attaching
to this discussion of family matters, that their stay had been prolonged
to a very improper and unfashionable length; but they suddenly
recollected themselves now and took their departure.</p>
<p>Laura’s scorn was boundless. The more she thought of these people and
their extraordinary talk, the more offensive they seemed to her; and yet
she confessed that if one must choose between the two extreme
aristocracies it might be best, on the whole, looking at things from a
strictly business point of view, to herd with the Parvenus; she was in
Washington solely to compass a certain matter and to do it at any cost,
and these people might be useful to her, while it was plain that her
purposes and her schemes for pushing them would not find favor in the
eyes of the Antiques. If it came to choice–and it might come to that,
sooner or later–she believed she could come to a decision without much
difficulty or many pangs.</p>
<p>But the best aristocracy of the three Washington castes, and really
the most powerful, by far, was that of the Middle Ground: It was made up
of the families of public men from nearly every state in the Union–men
who held positions in both the executive and legislative branches of the
government, and whose characters had been for years blemishless, both at
home and at the capital. These gentlemen and their households were
unostentatious people; they were educated and refined; they troubled
themselves but little about the two other orders of nobility, but moved
serenely in their wide orbit, confident in their own strength and well
aware of the potency of their influence. They had no troublesome
appearances to keep up, no rivalries which they cared to distress
themselves about, no jealousies to fret over. They could afford to mind
their own affairs and leave other combinations to do the same or do
otherwise, just as they chose. They were people who were beyond
reproach, and that was sufficient.</p>
<p>Senator Dilworthy never came into collision with any of these
factions. He labored for them all and with them all. He said that all
men were brethren and all were entitled to the honest unselfish help and
countenance of a Christian laborer in the public vineyard.</p>
<p>Laura concluded, after reflection, to let circumstances determine the
course it might be best for her to pursue as regarded the several
aristocracies.</p>
<p>Now it might occur to the reader that perhaps Laura had been somewhat
rudely suggestive in her remarks to Mrs. Oreille when the subject of
corals was under discussion, but it did not occur to Laura herself. She
was not a person of exaggerated refinement; indeed, the society and the
influences that had formed her character had not been of a nature
calculated to make her so; she thought that “give and take was fair
play,“ and that to parry an offensive thrust with a sarcasm was a neat
and legitimate thing to do. She some times talked to people in a way
which some ladies would consider, actually shocking; but Laura rather
prided herself upon some of her exploits of that character. We are sorry
we cannot make her a faultless heroine; but we cannot, for the reason
that she was human.</p>
<p>She considered herself a superior conversationist. Long ago, when the
possibility had first been brought before her mind that some day she
might move in Washington society, she had recognized the fact that
practiced conversational powers would be a necessary weapon in that
field; she had also recognized the fact that since her dealings there
must be mainly with men, and men whom she supposed to be exceptionally
cultivated and able, she would need heavier shot in her magazine than
mere brilliant “society“ nothings; whereupon she had at once entered
upon a tireless and elaborate course of reading, and had never since
ceased to devote every unoccupied moment to this sort of preparation.
Having now acquired a happy smattering of various information, she used
it with good effect–she passed for a singularly well informed woman in
Washington. The quality of her literary tastes had necessarily undergone
constant improvement under this regimen, and as necessarily, also; the
duality of her language had improved, though it cannot be denied that
now and then her former condition of life betrayed itself in just
perceptible inelegancies of expression and lapses of grammar.</p>
