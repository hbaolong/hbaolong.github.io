<h4 id="chapter-23-traveling-incognito">Chapter 23 Traveling
Incognito</h4>
<p>MY idea was, to tarry a while in every town between St. Louis and New
Orleans. To do this, it would be necessary to go from place to place by
the short packet lines. It was an easy plan to make, and would have been
an easy one to follow, twenty years ago–but not now. There are wide
intervals between boats, these days.</p>
<p>I wanted to begin with the interesting old French settlements of
St. Genevieve and Kaskaskia, sixty miles below St. Louis. There was only
one boat advertised for that section–a Grand Tower packet. Still, one
boat was enough; so we went down to look at her. She was a venerable
rack- heap, and a fraud to boot; for she was playing herself for
personal property, whereas the good honest dirt was so thickly caked all
over her that she was righteously taxable as real estate. There are
places in New England where her hurricane deck would be worth a hundred
and fifty dollars an acre. The soil on her forecastle was quite good–the
new crop of wheat was already springing from the cracks in protected
places. The companionway was of a dry sandy character, and would have
been well suited for grapes, with a southern exposure and a little
subsoiling. The soil of the boiler deck was thin and rocky, but good
enough for grazing purposes. A colored boy was on watch here–nobody else
visible. We gathered from him that this calm craft would go, as
advertised, ‘if she got her trip;’ if she didn’t get it, she would wait
for it.</p>
<p>‘Has she got any of her trip?’</p>
<p>‘Bless you, no, boss. She ain’t unloadened, yit. She only come in dis
mawnin’.’</p>
<p>He was uncertain as to when she might get her trip, but thought it
might be to-morrow or maybe next day. This would not answer at all; so
we had to give up the novelty of sailing down the river on a farm. We
had one more arrow in our quiver: a Vicksburg packet, the ‘Gold Dust,’
was to leave at 5 P.M. We took passage in her for Memphis, and gave up
the idea of stopping off here and there, as being impracticable. She was
neat, clean, and comfortable. We camped on the boiler deck, and bought
some cheap literature to kill time with. The vender was a venerable
Irishman with a benevolent face and a tongue that worked easily in the
socket, and from him we learned that he had lived in St. Louis
thirty-four years and had never been across the river during that
period. Then he wandered into a very flowing lecture, filled with
classic names and allusions, which was quite wonderful for fluency until
the fact became rather apparent that this was not the first time, nor
perhaps the fiftieth, that the speech had been delivered. He was a good
deal of a character, and much better company than the sappy literature
he was selling. A random remark, connecting Irishmen and beer, brought
this nugget of information out of him–</p>
<p>They don’t drink it, sir. They can’t drink it, sir. Give an Irishman
lager for a month, and he’s a dead man. An Irishman is lined with
copper, and the beer corrodes it. But whiskey polishes the copper and is
the saving of him, sir.’</p>
<p>At eight o’clock, promptly, we backed out and crossed the river. As
we crept toward the shore, in the thick darkness, a blinding glory of
white electric light burst suddenly from our forecastle, and lit up the
water and the warehouses as with a noon-day glare. Another big change,
this– no more flickering, smoky, pitch-dripping, ineffectual
torch-baskets, now: their day is past. Next, instead of calling out a
score of hands to man the stage, a couple of men and a hatful of steam
lowered it from the derrick where it was suspended, launched it,
deposited it in just the right spot, and the whole thing was over and
done with before a mate in the olden time could have got his
profanity-mill adjusted to begin the preparatory services. Why this new
and simple method of handling the stages was not thought of when the
first steamboat was built, is a mystery which helps one to realize what
a dull-witted slug the average human being is.</p>
<p>We finally got away at two in the morning, and when I turned out at
six, we were rounding to at a rocky point where there was an old stone
warehouse–at any rate, the ruins of it; two or three decayed dwelling-
houses were near by, in the shelter of the leafy hills; but there were
no evidences of human or other animal life to be seen. I wondered if I
had forgotten the river; for I had no recollection whatever of this
place; the shape of the river, too, was unfamiliar; there was nothing in
sight, anywhere, that I could remember ever having seen before. I was
surprised, disappointed, and annoyed.</p>
<p>We put ashore a well-dressed lady and gentleman, and two
well-dressed, lady-like young girls, together with sundry Russia-leather
bags. A strange place for such folk! No carriage was waiting. The party
moved off as if they had not expected any, and struck down a winding
country road afoot.</p>
<p>But the mystery was explained when we got under way again; for these
people were evidently bound for a large town which lay shut in behind a
tow-head (i.e., new island) a couple of miles below this landing. I
couldn’t remember that town; I couldn’t place it, couldn’t call its
name. So I lost part of my temper. I suspected that it might be
St. Genevieve–and so it proved to be. Observe what this eccentric river
had been about: it had built up this huge useless tow-head directly in
front of this town, cut off its river communications, fenced it away
completely, and made a ‘country’ town of it. It is a fine old place,
too, and deserved a better fate. It was settled by the French, and is a
relic of a time when one could travel from the mouths of the Mississippi
to Quebec and be on French territory and under French rule all the
way.</p>
<p>Presently I ascended to the hurricane deck and cast a longing glance
toward the pilot-house.</p>
