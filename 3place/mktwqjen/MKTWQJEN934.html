1895-96, TO H. H. ROGERS AND OTHERS. FINISHING “JOAN OF ARC.“ THE TRIP
AROUND THE WORLD. DEATH OF SUSY CLEMENS</h4>
<p>To H. H. Rogers, in New York City:</p>
<p>[No date.] DEAR MR. ROGERS,–Yours of Dec. 21 has arrived, containing
the circular to stockholders and I guess the Co. will really quit–there
doesn’t seem to be any other wise course.</p>
<p>There’s one thing which makes it difficult for me to soberly realize
that my ten year dream is actually dissolved; and that is, that it
reveries my horoscope. The proverb says, “Born lucky, always lucky,“ and
I am very superstitious. As a small boy I was notoriously lucky. It was
usual for one or two of our lads (per annum) to get drowned in the
Mississippi or in Bear Creek, but I was pulled out in a 2/3 drowned
condition 9 times before I learned to swim, and was considered to be a
cat in disguise. When the “Pennsylvania“ blew up and the telegraph
reported my brother as fatally injured (with 60 others) but made no
mention of me, my uncle said to my mother “It means that Sam was
somewhere else, after being on that boat a year and a half–he was born
lucky.“ Yes, I was somewhere else. I am so superstitious that I have
always been afraid to have business dealings with certain relatives and
friends of mine because they were unlucky people. All my life I have
stumbled upon lucky chances of large size, and whenever they were wasted
it was because of my own stupidity and carelessness. And so I have felt
entirely certain that that machine would turn up trumps eventually. It
disappointed me lots of times, but I couldn’t shake off the confidence
of a life-time in my luck.</p>
<p>Well, whatever I get out of the wreckage will be due to good luck–the
good luck of getting you into the scheme–for, but for that, there
wouldn’t be any wreckage; it would be total loss.</p>
<p>I wish you had been in at the beginning. Then we should have had the
good luck to step promptly ashore.</p>
<p>Miss Harrison has had a dream which promises me a large bank account,
and I want her to go ahead and dream it twice more, so as to make the
prediction sure to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>I’ve got a first rate subject for a book. It kept me awake all night,
and I began it and completed it in my mind. The minute I finish Joan I
will take it up. Love and Happy New Year to you all. Sincerely yours, S.
L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>This was about the end of the machine interests so far as Clemens was
concerned. Paige succeeded in getting some new people interested, but
nothing important happened, or that in any way affected Mark Twain.
Characteristically he put the whole matter behind him and plunged into
his work, facing comparative poverty and a burden of debts with a stout
heart. The beginning of the new year found him really poorer in purse
than he had ever been in his life, but certainly not crushed, or even
discouraged–at least, not permanently–and never more industrious or
capable.</p>
<p>To H. H. Rogers, in New York City:</p>
<p>169 RUE DE L’UNIVERSITE, PARIS, Jan. 23, ‘95. DEAR MR. ROGERS,–After
I wrote you, two or three days ago I thought I would make a holiday of
the rest of the day–the second deliberate holiday since I had the gout.
On the first holiday I wrote a tale of about 6,000 words, which was 3
days’ work in one; and this time I did 8,000 before midnight. I got
nothing out of that first holiday but the recreation of it, for I
condemned the work after careful reading and some revision; but this
time I fared better–I finished the Huck Finn tale that lies in your
safe, and am satisfied with it.</p>
<p>The Bacheller syndicate (117 Tribune Building) want a story of 5,000
words (lowest limit of their London agent) for ,000 and offer to plank
the check on delivery, and it was partly to meet that demand that I took
that other holiday. So as I have no short story that suits me (and can’t
and shan’t make promises), the best I can do is to offer the longer one
which I finished on my second holiday–“Tom Sawyer, Detective.“</p>
<p>It makes 27 or 28,000 words, and is really written for grown folks,
though I expect young folk to read it, too. It transfers to the banks of
the Mississippi the incidents of a strange murder which was committed in
Sweden in old times.</p>
<p>I’ll refer applicants for a sight of the story to you or Miss
Harrison. –[Secretary to Mr. Rogers.] Yours sincerely, S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>To H. H. Rogers, in New York City:</p>
<p>169 RUE DE L’UNIVERSITE, Apr. 29, ’95. DEAR MR. ROGERS,–Your
felicitous delightful letter of the 15th arrived three days ago, and
brought great pleasure into the house.</p>
<p>There is one thing that weighs heavily on Mrs. Clemens and me. That
is Brusnahan’s money. If he is satisfied to have it invested in the
Chicago enterprise, well and good; if not, we would like to have the
money paid back to him. I will give him as many months to decide in as
he pleases –let him name 6 or 10 or 12–and we will let the money stay
where it is in your hands till the time is up. Will Miss Harrison tell
him so? I mean if you approve. I would like him to have a good
investment, but would meantime prefer to protect him against loss.</p>
<p>At 6 minutes past 7, yesterday evening, Joan of Arc was burned at the
stake.</p>
<p>With the long strain gone, I am in a sort of physical collapse today,
but it will be gone tomorrow. I judged that this end of the book would
be hard work, and it turned out so. I have never done any work before
that cost so much thinking and weighing and measuring and planning and
cramming, or so much cautious and painstaking execution. For I wanted
the whole Rouen trial in, if it could be got in in such a way that the
reader’s interest would not flag–in fact I wanted the reader’s interest
to increase; and so I stuck to it with that determination in view–with
the result that I have left nothing out but unimportant repetitions.
Although it is mere history–history pure and simple–history stripped
naked of flowers, embroideries, colorings, exaggerations, invention–the
family agree that I have succeeded. It was a perilous thing to try in a
tale, but I never believed it a doubtful one–provided I stuck strictly
to business and didn’t weaken and give up: or didn’t get lazy and skimp
the work. The first two-thirds of the book were easy; for I only needed
to keep my historical road straight; therefore I used for reference only
one French history and one English one–and shoveled in as much fancy
work and invention on both sides of the historical road as I pleased.
But on this last third I have constantly used five French sources and
five English ones and I think no telling historical nugget in any of
them has escaped me.</p>
<p>Possibly the book may not sell, but that is nothing–it was written
for love.</p>
<p>There–I’m called to see company. The family seldom require this of
me, but they know I am not working today. Yours sincerely, S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>“Brusnahan,“ of the foregoing letter, was an employee of the New York
Herald, superintendent of the press-room–who had invested some of his
savings in the type-setter.</p>
<p>In February Clemens returned to New York to look after matters
connected with his failure and to close arrangements for a reading-tour
around the world. He was nearly sixty years old, and time had not
lessened his loathing for the platform. More than once, however, in
earlier years, he had turned to it as a debt-payer, and never yet had
his burden been so great as now. He concluded arrangements with Major
Pond to take him as far as the Pacific Coast, and with R. S. Smythe, of
Australia, for the rest of the tour. In April we find him once more back
in Paris preparing to bring the family to America, He had returned by
way of London, where he had visited Stanley the explorer–an old
friend.</p>
<p>To H. H. Rogers, in New York City:</p>
<p>169 RUE DE L’UNIVERSITE, Sunday, Apr.7,’95. DEAR MR. ROGERS,–…..
Stanley is magnificently housed in London, in a grand mansion in the
midst of the official world, right off Downing Street and Whitehall. He
had an extraordinary assemblage of brains and fame there to meet
me–thirty or forty (both sexes) at dinner, and more than a hundred came
in, after dinner. Kept it up till after midnight. There were cabinet
ministers, ambassadors, admirals, generals, canons, Oxford professors,
novelists, playwrights, poets, and a number of people equipped with rank
and brains. I told some yarns and made some speeches. I promised to call
on all those people next time I come to London, and show them the wife
and the daughters. If I were younger and very strong I would dearly love
to spend a season in London–provided I had no work on hand, or no work
more exacting than lecturing. I think I will lecture there a month or
two when I return from Australia.</p>
<p>There were many delightful ladies in that company. One was the wife
of His Excellency Admiral Bridge, Commander-in Chief of the Australian
Station, and she said her husband was able to throw wide all doors to me
in that part of the world and would be glad to do it, and would yacht me
and my party around, and excursion us in his flag-ship and make us have
a great time; and she said she would write him we were coming, and we
would find him ready. I have a letter from her this morning enclosing a
letter of introduction to the Admiral. I already know the Admiral
commanding in the China Seas and have promised to look in on him out
there. He sleeps with my books under his pillow. P’raps it is the only
way he can sleep.</p>
<p>According to Mrs. Clemens’s present plans–subject to modification, of
course–we sail in May; stay one day, or two days in New York, spend
June, July and August in Elmira and prepare my lectures; then lecture in
San Francisco and thereabouts during September and sail for Australia
before the middle of October and open the show there about the middle of
November. We don’t take the girls along; it would be too expensive and
they are quite willing to remain behind anyway.</p>
<p>Mrs. C. is feeling so well that she is not going to try the New York
doctor till we have gone around the world and robbed it and made the
finances a little easier. With a power of love to you all, S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>There would come moments of depression, of course, and a week later
he wrote: “I am tired to death all the time:“ To a man of less vitality,
less vigor of mind and body, it is easy to believe that under such
circumstances this condition would have remained permanent. But perhaps,
after all, it was his comic outlook on things in general that was his
chief life-saver.</p>
<p>To H. H. Rogers, in New York City:</p>
<p>169 RUE DE L’UNIVERSITE, Apr. 29, ’95. DEAR MR. ROGERS,–I have been
hidden an hour or two, reading proof of Joan and now I think I am a lost
child. I can’t find anybody on the place. The baggage has all
disappeared, including the family. I reckon that in the hurry and bustle
of moving to the hotel they forgot me. But it is no matter. It is
peacefuller now than I have known it for days and days and days.</p>
<p>In these Joan proofs which I have been reading for the September
Harper I find a couple of tip-top platform readings–and I mean to read
them on our trip. If the authorship is known by then; and if it isn’t, I
will reveal it. The fact is, there is more good platform-stuff in Joan
than in any previous book of mine, by a long sight.</p>
<p>Yes, every danged member of the tribe has gone to the hotel and left
me lost. I wonder how they can be so careless with property. I have got
to try to get there by myself now.</p>
<p>All the trunks are going over as luggage; then I’ve got to find
somebody on the dock who will agree to ship 6 of them to the Hartford
Customhouse. If it is difficult I will dump them into the river. It is
very careless of Mrs. Clemens to trust trunks and things to me.
Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>By the latter part of May they were at Quarry Farm, and Clemens, laid
up there with a carbuncle, was preparing for his long tour. The outlook
was not a pleasant one. To Mr. Rogers he wrote: “I sha’n’t be able to
stand on the platform before we start west. I sha’n’t get a single
chance to practice my reading; but will have to appear in Cleveland
without the essential preparation. Nothing in this world can save it
from being a shabby, poor disgusting performance. I’ve got to stand; I
can’t do it and talk to a house, and how in the nation am I going to
sit? Land of Goshen, it’s this night week! Pray for me.“</p>
<p>The opening at Cleveland July 15th appears not to have been much of a
success, though from another reason, one that doubtless seemed amusing
to him later.</p>
<p>To H. H. Rogers, in New York City:</p>
<p>(Forenoon) CLEVELAND, July 16, ’95. DEAR MR. ROGERS,–Had a roaring
success at the Elmira reformatory Sunday night. But here, last night, I
suffered defeat–There were a couple of hundred little boys behind me on
the stage, on a lofty tier of benches which made them the most
conspicuous objects in the house. And there was nobody to watch them or
keep them quiet. Why, with their scufflings and horse-play and noise, it
was just a menagerie. Besides, a concert of amateurs had been smuggled
into the program (to precede me,) and their families and friends (say
ten per cent of the audience) kept encoring them and they always
responded. So it was 20 minutes to 9 before I got the platform in front
of those 2,600 people who had paid a dollar apiece for a chance to go to
hell in this fashion.</p>
<p>I got started magnificently, but inside of half an hour the scuffling
boys had the audience’s maddened attention and I saw it was a gone case;
so I skipped a third of my program and quit. The newspapers are kind,
but between you and me it was a defeat. There ain’t going to be any more
concerts at my lectures. I care nothing for this defeat, because it was
not my fault. My first half hour showed that I had the house, and I
could have kept it if I hadn’t been so handicapped. Yours sincerely, S.
L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>P. S. Had a satisfactory time at Petoskey. Crammed the house and
turned away a crowd. We had 48 in the house, which was 00 more than it
had ever had in it before. I believe I don’t care to have a talk go off
better than that one did.</p>
<p>Mark Twain, on this long tour, was accompanied by his wife and his
daughter Clara–Susy and Jean Clemens remaining with their aunt at Quarry
Farm. The tour was a financial success from the start. By the time they
were ready to sail from Vancouver five thousand dollars had been
remitted to Mr. Rogers against that day of settlement when the debts of
Webster andandandand Co. were to be paid. Perhaps it should be stated
here that a legal settlement had been arranged on a basis of fifty cents
on the dollar, but neither Clemens nor his wife consented to this as
final. They would pay in full.</p>
<p>They sailed from Vancouver August 23, 1895. About the only letter of
this time is an amusing note to Rudyard Kipling, written at the moment
of departure.</p>
<p>To Rudyard Kipling, in England:</p>
<p>August, 1895. DEAR KIPLING,–It is reported that you are about to
visit India. This has moved me to journey to that far country in order
that I may unload from my conscience a debt long due to you. Years ago
you came from India to Elmira to visit me, as you said at the time. It
has always been my purpose to return that visit and that great
compliment some day. I shall arrive next January and you must be ready.
I shall come riding my ayah with his tusks adorned with silver bells and
ribbons and escorted by a troop of native howdahs richly clad and
mounted upon a herd of wild bungalows; and you must be on hand with a
few bottles of ghee, for I shall be thirsty. Affectionately, S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Clemens, platforming in Australia, was too busy to write letters.
Everywhere he was welcomed by great audiences, and everywhere lavishly
entertained. He was beset by other carbuncles, but would seem not to
have been seriously delayed by them. A letter to his old friend Twichell
carries the story.</p>
<p>To Rev. Jos. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>FRANK MOELLER’S MASONIC HOTEL, NAPIER, NEW ZEALAND, November 29, ’95.
DEAR JOE,–Your welcome letter of two months and five days ago has just
arrived, and finds me in bed with another carbuncle. It is No. 3. Not a
serious one this time. I lectured last night without inconvenience, but
the doctors thought best to forbid to-night’s lecture. My second one
kept me in bed a week in Melbourne.</p>
<p>…..We are all glad it is you who is to write the article, it delights
us all through.</p>
<p>I think it was a good stroke of luck that knocked me on my back here
at Napier, instead of some hotel in the centre of a noisy city. Here we
have the smooth and placidly-complaining sea at our door, with nothing
between us and it but 20 yards of shingle–and hardly a suggestion of
life in that space to mar it or make a noise. Away down here fifty-five
degrees south of the Equator this sea seems to murmur in an unfamiliar
tongue–a foreign tongue–tongue bred among the ice-fields of the
Antarctic–a murmur with a note of melancholy in it proper to the vast
unvisited solitudes it has come from. It was very delicious and solacing
to wake in the night and find it still pulsing there. I wish you were
here–land, but it would be fine!</p>
<p>Livy and Clara enjoy this nomadic life pretty well; certainly better
than one could have expected they would. They have tough experiences, in
the way of food and beds and frantic little ships, but they put up with
the worst that befalls with heroic endurance that resembles
contentment.</p>
<p>No doubt I shall be on the platform next Monday. A week later we
shall reach Wellington; talk there 3 nights, then sail back to
Australia. We sailed for New Zealand October 30.</p>
<p>Day before yesterday was Livy’s birthday (under world time), and
tomorrow will be mine. I shall be 60–no thanks for it.</p>
<p>I and the others send worlds and worlds of love to all you dear
ones.</p>
<p>MARK.</p>
<p>The article mentioned in the foregoing letter was one which Twichell
had been engaged by Harper’s Magazine to write concerning the home life
and characteristics of Mark Twain. By the time the Clemens party had
completed their tour of India–a splendid, triumphant tour, too full of
work and recreation for letter-writing–and had reached South Africa, the
article had appeared, a satisfactory one, if we may judge by Mark
Twain’s next.</p>
<p>This letter, however, has a special interest in the account it gives
of Mark Twain’s visit to the Jameson raiders, then imprisoned at
Pretoria.</p>
<p>To Rev. Jos. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC, The Queen’s Birthday, ’96. (May 24)
DEAR OLD JOE,–Harper for May was given to me yesterday in Johannesburg
by an American lady who lives there, and I read your article on me while
coming up in the train with her and an old friend and fellow-Missourian
of mine, Mrs. John Hays Hammond, the handsome and spirited wife of the
chief of the 4 Reformers, who lies in prison here under a 15-year
sentence, along with 50 minor Reformers who are in for 1 and 5-year
terms. Thank you a thousand times Joe, you have praised me away above my
deserts, but I am not the man to quarrel with you for that; and as for
Livy, she will take your very hardiest statements at par, and be
grateful to you to the bottom of her heart. Between you and Punch and
Brander Matthews, I am like to have my opinion of myself raised
sufficiently high; and I guess the children will be after you, for it is
the study of their lives to keep my self-appreciation down somewhere
within bounds.</p>
<p>I had a note from Mrs. Rev. Gray (nee Tyler) yesterday, and called on
her to-day. She is well.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was allowed to enter the prison with Mrs. Hammond. A Boer
guard was at my elbow all the time, but was courteous and polite, only
he barred the way in the compound (quadrangle or big open court) and
wouldn’t let me cross a white mark that was on the ground–the
“death-line“ one of the prisoners called it. Not in earnest, though, I
think. I found that I had met Hammond once when he was a Yale senior and
a guest of Gen. Franklin’s. I also found that I had known Capt. Mein
intimately 32 years ago. One of the English prisoners had heard me
lecture in London 23 years ago. After being introduced in turn to all
the prisoners, I was allowed to see some of the cells and examine their
food, beds, etc. I was told in Johannesburg that Hammond’s salary of
50,000 a year is not stopped, and that the salaries of some of the
others are still continued. Hammond was looking very well indeed, and I
can say the same of all the others. When the trouble first fell upon
them it hit some of them very hard; several fell sick (Hammond among
them), two or three had to be removed to the hospital, and one of the
favorites lost his mind and killed himself, poor fellow, last week. His
funeral, with a sorrowing following of 10,000, took the place of the
public demonstration the Americans were getting up for me.</p>
<p>These prisoners are strong men, prominent men, and I believe they are
all educated men. They are well off; some of them are wealthy. They have
a lot of books to read, they play games and smoke, and for awhile they
will be able to bear up in their captivity; but not for long, not for
very long, I take it. I am told they have times of deadly brooding and
depression. I made them a speech–sitting down. It just happened so. I
don’t prefer that attitude. Still, it has one advantage–it is only a
talk, it doesn’t take the form of a speech. I have tried it once before
on this trip. However, if a body wants to make sure of having “liberty,“
and feeling at home, he had better stand up, of course. I advised them
at considerable length to stay where they were–they would get used to it
and like it presently; if they got out they would only get in again
somewhere else, by the look of their countenances; and I promised to go
and see the President and do what I could to get him to double their
jail-terms.</p>
<p>We had a very good sociable time till the permitted time was up and a
little over, and we outsiders had to go. I went again to-day, but the
Rev. Mr. Gray had just arrived, and the warden, a genial, elderly Boer
named Du Plessis–explained that his orders wouldn’t allow him to admit
saint and sinner at the same time, particularly on a Sunday. Du Plessis
–descended from the Huguenot fugitives, you see, of 200 years ago –but
he hasn’t any French left in him now–all Dutch.</p>
<p>It gravels me to think what a goose I was to make Livy and Clara
remain in Durban; but I wanted to save them the 30-hour railway trip to
Johannesburg. And Durban and its climate and opulent foliage were so
lovely, and the friends there were so choice and so hearty that I
sacrificed myself in their interests, as I thought. It is just the
beginning of winter, and although the days are hot, the nights are cool.
But it’s lovely weather in these regions, too; and the friends are as
lovely as the weather, and Johannesburg and Pretoria are brimming with
interest. I talk here twice more, then return to Johannesburg next
Wednesday for a fifth talk there; then to the Orange Free State capital,
then to some town on the way to Port Elizabeth, where the two will join
us by sea from Durban; then the gang will go to Kimberley and presently
to the Cape–and so, in the course of time, we shall get through and sail
for England; and then we will hunt up a quiet village and I will write
and Livy edit, for a few months, while Clara and Susy and Jean study
music and things in London.</p>
<p>We have had noble good times everywhere and every day, from
Cleveland, July 15, to Pretoria, May 24, and never a dull day either on
sea or land, notwithstanding the carbuncles and things. Even when I was
laid up 10 days at Jeypore in India we had the charmingest times with
English friends. All over India the English well, you will never know
how good and fine they are till you see them.</p>
<p>Midnight and after! and I must do many things to-day, and lecture
tonight.</p>
<p>A world of thanks to you, Joe dear, and a world of love to all of
you.</p>
<p>MARK.</p>
<p>Perhaps for readers of a later day a word as to what constituted the
Jameson raid would not be out of place here. Dr. Leander Starr Jameson
was an English physician, located at Kimberley. President Kruger (Oom
Paul), head of the South African Republic, was one of his patients;
also, Lobengula, the Matabele chief. From Lobengula concessions were
obtained which led to the formation of the South African Company.
Jameson gave up his profession and went in for conquest, associating
himself with the projects of Cecil Rhodes. In time he became
administrator of Rhodesia. By the end of 1894. he was in high feather,
and during a visit to England was feted as a sort of romantic conqueror
of the olden time. Perhaps this turned his head; at all events at the
end of 1895 came the startling news that “Dr. Jim,“ as he was called, at
the head of six hundred men, had ridden into the Transvaal in support of
a Rhodes scheme for an uprising at Johannesburg. The raid was a failure.
Jameson, and those other knights of adventure, were captured by the
forces of “Oom Paul,“ and some of them barely escaped execution. The
Boer president handed them over to the English Government for
punishment, and they received varying sentences, but all were eventually
released. Jameson, later, became again prominent in South-African
politics, but there is no record of any further raids.</p>
<p>…………………….</p>
<p>The Clemens party sailed from South Africa the middle of July, 1896,
and on the last day of the month reached England. They had not planned
to return to America, but to spend the winter in or near London in some
quiet place where Clemens could write the book of his travels.</p>
<p>The two daughters in America, Susy and Jean, were expected to arrive
August 12th, but on that day there came, instead, a letter saying that
Susy Clemens was not well enough to sail. A cable inquiry was
immediately sent, but the reply when it came was not satisfactory, and
Mrs. Clemens and Clara sailed for America without further delay. This
was on August 15th. Three days later, in the old home at Hartford, Susy
Clemens died of cerebral fever. She had been visiting Mrs. Charles
Dudley Warner, but by the physician’s advice had been removed to the
comfort and quiet of her own home, only a few steps away.</p>
<p>Mark Twain, returning from his triumphant tour of the world in the
hope that soon, now, he might be free from debt, with his family happily
gathered about him, had to face alone this cruel blow. There was no
purpose in his going to America; Susy would be buried long before his
arrival. He awaited in England the return of his broken family. They
lived that winter in a quiet corner of Chelsea, No. 23 Tedworth
Square.</p>
<p>To Rev. Joseph H. Twichell, in Hartford, Conn.:</p>
<p>Permanent address: % CHATTO andandandand WINDUS 111 T. MARTIN’S LANE,
LONDON, Sept. 27, ’96. Through Livy and Katy I have learned, dear old
Joe, how loyally you stood poor Susy’s friend, and mine, and Livy’s: how
you came all the way down, twice, from your summer refuge on your
merciful errands to bring the peace and comfort of your beloved
presence, first to that poor child, and again to the broken heart of her
poor desolate mother. It was like you; like your good great heart, like
your matchless and unmatchable self. It was no surprise to me to learn
that you stayed by Susy long hours, careless of fatigue and heat, it was
no surprise to me to learn that you could still the storms that swept
her spirit when no other could; for she loved you, revered you, trusted
you, and “Uncle Joe“ was no empty phrase upon her lips! I am grateful to
you, Joe, grateful to the bottom of my heart, which has always been
filled with love for you, and respect and admiration; and I would have
chosen you out of all the world to take my place at Susy’s side and
Livy’s in those black hours.</p>
<p>Susy was a rare creature; the rarest that has been reared in Hartford
in this generation. And Livy knew it, and you knew it, and Charley
Warner and George, and Harmony, and the Hillyers and the Dunhams and the
Cheneys, and Susy and Lilly, and the Bunces, and Henry Robinson and Dick
Burton, and perhaps others. And I also was of the number, but not in the
same degree–for she was above my duller comprehension. I merely knew
that she was my superior in fineness of mind, in the delicacy and
subtlety of her intellect, but to fully measure her I was not competent.
I know her better now; for I have read her private writings and sounded
the deeps of her mind; and I know better, now, the treasure that was
mine than I knew it when I had it. But I have this consolation: that
dull as I was, I always knew enough to be proud when she commended me or
my work –as proud as if Livy had done it herself–and I took it as the
accolade from the hand of genius. I see now–as Livy always saw–that she
had greatness in her; and that she herself was dimly conscious of
it.</p>
<p>And now she is dead–and I can never tell her.</p>
<p>God bless you Joe–and all of your house. S. L. C.</p>
<p>To Mr. Henry C. Robinson, Hartford, Conn.:</p>
<p>LONDON, Sept. 28, ’96. It is as you say, dear old friend, “the pathos
of it“ yes, it was a piteous thing–as piteous a tragedy as any the year
can furnish. When we started westward upon our long trip at half past
ten at night, July 14, 1895, at Elmira, Susy stood on the platform in
the blaze of the electric light waving her good-byes to us as the train
glided away, her mother throwing back kisses and watching her through
her tears. One year, one month, and one week later, Clara and her mother
having exactly completed the circuit of the globe, drew up at that
platform at the same hour of the night, in the same train and the same
car–and again Susy had come a journey and was near at hand to meet them.
She was waiting in the house she was born in, in her coffin.</p>
<p>All the circumstances of this death were pathetic–my brain is worn to
rags rehearsing them. The mere death would have been cruelty enough,
without overloading it and emphasizing it with that score of harsh and
wanton details. The child was taken away when her mother was within
three days of her, and would have given three decades for sight of
her.</p>
<p>In my despair and unassuageable misery I upbraid myself for ever
parting with her. But there is no use in that. Since it was to happen it
would have happened. With love S. L. C.</p>
<p>The life at Tedworth Square that winter was one of almost complete
privacy. Of the hundreds of friends which Mark Twain had in London
scarcely half a dozen knew his address. He worked steadily on his book
of travels, ‘Following the Equator’, and wrote few letters beyond
business communications to Mr. Rogers. In one of these he said, “I am
appalled! Here I am trying to load you up with work again after you have
been dray-horsing over the same tiresome ground for a year. It’s too
bad, and I am ashamed of it.“</p>
<p>But late in November he sent a letter of a different sort–one that
was to have an important bearing on the life of a girl today of unique
and world-wide distinction.</p>
<p>To Mrs. H. H. Rogers, in New York City:</p>
<p>For and in behalf of Helen Keller, stone blind and deaf, and formerly
dumb.</p>
<p>DEAR MRS. ROGERS,–Experience has convinced me that when one wishes to
set a hard-worked man at something which he mightn’t prefer to be
bothered with, it is best to move upon him behind his wife. If she can’t
convince him it isn’t worth while for other people to try.</p>
<p>Mr. Rogers will remember our visit with that astonishing girl at
Lawrence Hutton’s house when she was fourteen years old. Last July, in
Boston, when she was 16 she underwent the Harvard examination for
admission to Radcliffe College. She passed without a single condition.
She was allowed the same amount of time that is granted to other
applicants, and this was shortened in her case by the fact that the
question papers had to be read to her. Yet she scored an average of 90
as against an average of 78 on the part of the other applicants.</p>
<p>It won’t do for America to allow this marvelous child to retire from
her studies because of poverty. If she can go on with them she will make
a fame that will endure in history for centuries. Along her special
lines she is the most extraordinary product of all the ages.</p>
<p>There is danger that she must retire from the struggle for a College
degree for lack of support for herself and for Miss Sullivan, (the
teacher who has been with her from the start–Mr. Rogers will remember
her.) Mrs. Hutton writes to ask me to interest rich Englishmen in her
case, and I would gladly try, but my secluded life will not permit it. I
see nobody. Nobody knows my address. Nothing but the strictest hiding
can enable me to write my long book in time.</p>
<p>So I thought of this scheme: Beg you to lay siege to your husband and
get him to interest himself and Mess. John D. and William Rockefeller
and the other Standard Oil chiefs in Helen’s case; get them to subscribe
an annual aggregate of six or seven hundred or a thousand dollars–and
agree to continue this for three or four years, until she has completed
her college course. I’m not trying to limit their generosity–indeed no,
they may pile that Standard Oil, Helen Keller College Fund as high as
they please, they have my consent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hutton’s idea is to raise a permanent fund the interest upon
which shall support Helen and her teacher and put them out of the fear
of want. I shan’t say a word against it, but she will find it a
difficult and disheartening job, and meanwhile what is to become of that
miraculous girl?</p>
<p>No, for immediate and sound effectiveness, the thing is for you to
plead with Mr. Rogers for this hampered wonder of your sex, and send him
clothed with plenary powers to plead with the other chiefs–they have
spent mountains of money upon the worthiest benevolences, and I think
that the same spirit which moved them to put their hands down through
their hearts into their pockets in those cases will answer “Here!“ when
its name is called in this one. 638</p>
<p>There–I don’t need to apologize to you or to H. H. for this appeal
that I am making; I know you too well for that.</p>
<p>Good-bye with love to all of you S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Laurence Hutton is on the staff of Harper’s Monthly–close by, and
handy when wanted.</p>
<p>The plea was not made in vain. Mr. and Mrs. Rogers interested
themselves most liberally in Helen Keller’s fortune, and certainly no
one can say that any of those who contributed to her success ever had
reason for disappointment.</p>
<p>In his letter of grateful acknowledgment, which follows, Clemens also
takes occasion to thank Mr. Rogers for his further efforts in the matter
of his own difficulties. This particular reference concerns the
publishing, complications which by this time had arisen between the
American Publishing Company, of Hartford, and the house in Franklin
Square.</p>
<p>LONDON, Dec. 22, ’96. DEAR MRS. ROGERS,–It is superb! And I am beyond
measure grateful to you both. I knew you would be interested in that
wonderful girl, and that Mr. Rogers was already interested in her and
touched by her; and I was sure that if nobody else helped her you two
would; but you have gone far and away beyond the sum I expected–may your
lines fall in pleasant places here and Hereafter for it!</p>
<p>The Huttons are as glad and grateful as they can be, and I am glad
for their sakes as well as for Helen’s.</p>
<p>I want to thank Mr. Rogers for crucifying himself again on the same
old cross between Bliss and Harper; and goodness knows I hope he will
come to enjoy it above all other dissipations yet, seeing that it has
about it the elements of stability and permanency. However, at any time
that he says sign, we’re going to do it. Ever sincerely Yours S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
