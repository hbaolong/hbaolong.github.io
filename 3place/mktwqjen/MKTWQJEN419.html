<h4 id="chapter-36-the-professors-yarn">Chapter 36 The Professor’s
Yarn</h4>
<p>IT was in the early days. I was not a college professor then. I was a
humble-minded young land-surveyor, with the world before me–to survey,
in case anybody wanted it done. I had a contract to survey a route for a
great mining-ditch in California, and I was on my way thither, by sea –a
three or four weeks’ voyage. There were a good many passengers, but I
had very little to say to them; reading and dreaming were my passions,
and I avoided conversation in order to indulge these appetites. There
were three professional gamblers on board–rough, repulsive fellows. I
never had any talk with them, yet I could not help seeing them with some
frequency, for they gambled in an upper-deck stateroom every day and
night, and in my promenades I often had glimpses of them through their
door, which stood a little ajar to let out the surplus tobacco smoke and
profanity. They were an evil and hateful presence, but I had to put up
with it, of course,</p>
<p>There was one other passenger who fell under my eye a good deal, for
he seemed determined to be friendly with me, and I could not have gotten
rid of him without running some chance of hurting his feelings, and I
was far from wishing to do that. Besides, there was something engaging
in his countrified simplicity and his beaming good-nature. The first
time I saw this Mr. John Backus, I guessed, from his clothes and his
looks, that he was a grazier or farmer from the backwoods of some
western State–doubtless Ohio–and afterward when he dropped into his
personal history and I discovered that he WAS a cattle-raiser from
interior Ohio, I was so pleased with my own penetration that I warmed
toward him for verifying my instinct.</p>
<p>He got to dropping alongside me every day, after breakfast, to help
me make my promenade; and so, in the course of time, his easy-working
jaw had told me everything about his business, his prospects, his
family, his relatives, his politics–in fact everything that concerned a
Backus, living or dead. And meantime I think he had managed to get out
of me everything I knew about my trade, my tribe, my purposes, my
prospects, and myself. He was a gentle and persuasive genius, and this
thing showed it; for I was not given to talking about my matters. I said
something about triangulation, once; the stately word pleased his ear;
he inquired what it meant; I explained; after that he quietly and
inoffensively ignored my name, and always called me Triangle.</p>
<p>What an enthusiast he was in cattle! At the bare name of a bull or a
cow, his eye would light and his eloquent tongue would turn itself
loose. As long as I would walk and listen, he would walk and talk; he
knew all breeds, he loved all breeds, he caressed them all with his
affectionate tongue. I tramped along in voiceless misery whilst the
cattle question was up; when I could endure it no longer, I used to
deftly insert a scientific topic into the conversation; then my eye
fired and his faded; my tongue fluttered, his stopped; life was a joy to
me, and a sadness to him.</p>
<p>One day he said, a little hesitatingly, and with somewhat of
diffidence–</p>
<p>‘Triangle, would you mind coming down to my stateroom a minute, and
have a little talk on a certain matter?’</p>
<p>I went with him at once. Arrived there, he put his head out, glanced
up and down the saloon warily, then closed the door and locked it. He
sat down on the sofa, and he said–</p>
<p>‘I’m a-going to make a little proposition to you, and if it strikes
you favorable, it’ll be a middling good thing for both of us. You ain’t
a-going out to Californy for fun, nuther am I–it’s business, ain’t that
so? Well, you can do me a good turn, and so can I you, if we see fit.
I’ve raked and scraped and saved, a considerable many years, and I’ve
got it all here.’ He unlocked an old hair trunk, tumbled a chaos of
shabby clothes aside, and drew a short stout bag into view for a moment,
then buried it again and relocked the trunk. Dropping his voice to a
cautious low tone, he continued, ‘She’s all there–a round ten thousand
dollars in yellow-boys; now this is my little idea: What I don’t know
about raising cattle, ain’t worth knowing. There’s mints of money in it,
in Californy. Well, I know, and you know, that all along a line that ’s
being surveyed, there ’s little dabs of land that they call “gores,“
that fall to the surveyor free gratis for nothing. All you’ve got to do,
on your side, is to survey in such a way that the “gores“ will fall on
good fat land, then you turn ’em over to me, I stock ’em with cattle, in
rolls the cash, I plank out your share of the dollars regular, right
along, and–’</p>
<p>I was sorry to wither his blooming enthusiasm, but it could not be
helped. I interrupted, and said severely–</p>
<p>‘I am not that kind of a surveyor. Let us change the subject,
Mr. Backus.’</p>
<p>It was pitiful to see his confusion and hear his awkward and
shamefaced apologies. I was as much distressed as he was–especially as
he seemed so far from having suspected that there was anything improper
in his proposition. So I hastened to console him and lead him on to
forget his mishap in a conversational orgy about cattle and butchery. We
were lying at Acapulco; and, as we went on deck, it happened luckily
that the crew were just beginning to hoist some beeves aboard in slings.
Backus’s melancholy vanished instantly, and with it the memory of his
late mistake.</p>
<p>‘Now only look at that!’ cried he; ‘My goodness, Triangle, what WOULD
they say to it in OHIO. Wouldn’t their eyes bug out, to see ’em handled
like that?–wouldn’t they, though?’</p>
<p>All the passengers were on deck to look–even the gamblers–and Backus
knew them all, and had afflicted them all with his pet topic. As I moved
away, I saw one of the gamblers approach and accost him; then another of
them; then the third. I halted; waited; watched; the conversation
continued between the four men; it grew earnest; Backus drew gradually
away; the gamblers followed, and kept at his elbow. I was uncomfortable.
However, as they passed me presently, I heard Backus say, with a tone of
persecuted annoyance–</p>
<p>‘But it ain’t any use, gentlemen; I tell you again, as I’ve told you
a half a dozen times before, I warn’t raised to it, and I ain’t a-going
to resk it.’</p>
<p>I felt relieved. ‘His level head will be his sufficient protection,’
I said to myself.</p>
<p>During the fortnight’s run from Acapulco to San Francisco I several
times saw the gamblers talking earnestly with Backus, and once I threw
out a gentle warning to him. He chuckled comfortably and said–</p>
<p>‘Oh, yes! they tag around after me considerable–want me to play a
little, just for amusement, they say–but laws-a-me, if my folks have
told me once to look out for that sort of live-stock, they’ve told me a
thousand times, I reckon.’</p>
<p>By-and-bye, in due course, we were approaching San Francisco. It was
an ugly black night, with a strong wind blowing, but there was not much
sea. I was on deck, alone. Toward ten I started below. A figure issued
from the gamblers’ den, and disappeared in the darkness. I experienced a
shock, for I was sure it was Backus. I flew down the companion-way,
looked about for him, could not find him, then returned to the deck just
in time to catch a glimpse of him as he re-entered that confounded nest
of rascality. Had he yielded at last? I feared it. What had he gone
below for?–His bag of coin? Possibly. I drew near the door, full of
bodings. It was a-crack, and I glanced in and saw a sight that made me
bitterly wish I had given my attention to saving my poor cattle-friend,
instead of reading and dreaming my foolish time away. He was gambling.
Worse still, he was being plied with champagne, and was already showing
some effect from it. He praised the ‘cider,’ as he called it, and said
now that he had got a taste of it he almost believed he would drink it
if it was spirits, it was so good and so ahead of anything he had ever
run across before. Surreptitious smiles, at this, passed from one rascal
to another, and they filled all the glasses, and whilst Backus honestly
drained his to the bottom they pretended to do the same, but threw the
wine over their shoulders.</p>
<p>I could not bear the scene, so I wandered forward and tried to
interest myself in the sea and the voices of the wind. But no, my uneasy
spirit kept dragging me back at quarter-hour intervals; and always I saw
Backus drinking his wine–fairly and squarely, and the others throwing
theirs away. It was the painfullest night I ever spent.</p>
<p>The only hope I had was that we might reach our anchorage with speed–
that would break up the game. I helped the ship along all I could with
my prayers. At last we went booming through the Golden Gate, and my
pulses leaped for joy. I hurried back to that door and glanced in. Alas,
there was small room for hope–Backus’s eyes were heavy and bloodshot,
his sweaty face was crimson, his speech maudlin and thick, his body
sawed drunkenly about with the weaving motion of the ship. He drained
another glass to the dregs, whilst the cards were being dealt.</p>
<p>He took his hand, glanced at it, and his dull eyes lit up for a
moment. The gamblers observed it, and showed their gratification by
hardly perceptible signs.</p>
<p>‘How many cards?’</p>
<p>‘None!’ said Backus.</p>
<p>One villain–named Hank Wiley–discarded one card, the others three
each. The betting began. Heretofore the bets had been trifling–a dollar
or two; but Backus started off with an eagle now, Wiley hesitated a
moment, then ‘saw it’ and ‘went ten dollars better.’ The other two threw
up their hands.</p>
<p>Backus went twenty better. Wiley said–</p>
<p>‘I see that, and go you a hundred better!’ then smiled and reached
for the money.</p>
<p>‘Let it alone,’ said Backus, with drunken gravity.</p>
<p>‘What! you mean to say you’re going to cover it?’</p>
<p>‘Cover it? Well, I reckon I am–and lay another hundred on top of it,
too.’</p>
<p>He reached down inside his overcoat and produced the required
sum.</p>
<p>‘Oh, that’s your little game, is it? I see your raise, and raise it
five hundred!’ said Wiley.</p>
<p>‘Five hundred better.’ said the foolish bull-driver, and pulled out
the amount and showered it on the pile. The three conspirators hardly
tried to conceal their exultation.</p>
<p>All diplomacy and pretense were dropped now, and the sharp
exclamations came thick and fast, and the yellow pyramid grew higher and
higher. At last ten thousand dollars lay in view. Wiley cast a bag of
coin on the table, and said with mocking gentleness–</p>
<p>‘Five thousand dollars better, my friend from the rural
districts–what do you say NOW?’</p>
<p>‘I CALL you!’ said Backus, heaving his golden shot-bag on the pile.
‘What have you got?’</p>
<p>‘Four kings, you d–d fool!’ and Wiley threw down his cards and
surrounded the stakes with his arms.</p>
<p>‘Four ACES, you ass!’ thundered Backus, covering his man with a
cocked revolver. ‘I’M A PROFESSIONAL GAMBLER MYSELF, AND I’VE BEEN
LAYING FOR YOU DUFFERS ALL THIS VOYAGE!’</p>
<p>Down went the anchor, rumbledy-dum-dum! and the long trip was
ended.</p>
<p>Well–well, it is a sad world. One of the three gamblers was Backus’s
‘pal.’ It was he that dealt the fateful hands. According to an
understanding with the two victims, he was to have given Backus four
queens, but alas, he didn’t.</p>
<p>A week later, I stumbled upon Backus–arrayed in the height of
fashion– in Montgomery Street. He said, cheerily, as we were
parting–</p>
<p>‘Ah, by-the-way, you needn’t mind about those gores. I don’t really
know anything about cattle, except what I was able to pick up in a
week’s apprenticeship over in Jersey just before we sailed. My cattle-
culture and cattle-enthusiasm have served their turn–I shan’t need them
any more.’</p>
<p>Next day we reluctantly parted from the ‘Gold Dust’ and her officers,
hoping to see that boat and all those officers again, some day. A thing
which the fates were to render tragically impossible!</p>
