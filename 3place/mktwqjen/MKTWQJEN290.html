<h4 id="the-great-revolution-in-pitcairn">THE GREAT REVOLUTION IN
PITCAIRN</h4>
<p>Let me refresh the reader’s memory a little. Nearly a hundred years
ago the crew of the British ship Bounty mutinied, set the captain and
his officers adrift upon the open sea, took possession of the ship, and
sailed southward. They procured wives for themselves among the natives
of Tahiti, then proceeded to a lonely little rock in mid-Pacific, called
Pitcairn’s Island, wrecked the vessel, stripped her of everything that
might be useful to a new colony, and established themselves on shore.
Pitcairn’s is so far removed from the track of commerce that it was many
years before another vessel touched there. It had always been considered
an uninhabited island; so when a ship did at last drop its anchor there,
in 1808, the captain was greatly surprised to find the place peopled.
Although the mutineers had fought among themselves, and gradually killed
each other off until only two or three of the original stock remained,
these tragedies had not occurred before a number of children had been
born; so in 1808 the island had a population of twenty-seven persons.
John Adams, the chief mutineer, still survived, and was to live many
years yet, as governor and patriarch of the flock. From being mutineer
and homicide, he had turned Christian and teacher, and his nation of
twenty-seven persons was now the purest and devoutest in Christendom.
Adams had long ago hoisted the British flag and constituted his island
an appanage of the British crown.</p>
<p>To-day the population numbers ninety persons–sixteen men, nineteen
women, twenty-five boys, and thirty girls–all descendants of the
mutineers, all bearing the family names of those mutineers, and all
speaking English, and English only. The island stands high up out of the
sea, and has precipitous walls. It is about three-quarters of a mile
long, and in places is as much as half a mile wide. Such arable land as
it affords is held by the several families, according to a division made
many years ago. There is some live stock–goats, pigs, chickens, and
cats; but no dogs, and no large animals. There is one church-building
used also as a capitol, a schoolhouse, and a public library. The title
of the governor has been, for a generation or two, “Magistrate and Chief
Ruler, in subordination to her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain.“ It
was his province to make the laws, as well as execute them. His office
was elective; everybody over seventeen years old had a vote–no matter
about the sex.</p>
<p>The sole occupations of the people were farming and fishing; their
sole recreation, religious services. There has never been a shop in the
island, nor any money. The habits and dress of the people have always
been primitive, and their laws simple to puerility. They have lived in a
deep Sabbath tranquillity, far from the world and its ambitions and
vexations, and neither knowing nor caring what was going on in the
mighty empires that lie beyond their limitless ocean solitudes. Once in
three or four years a ship touched there, moved them with aged news of
bloody battles, devastating epidemics, fallen thrones, and ruined
dynasties, then traded them some soap and flannel for some yams and
breadfruit, and sailed away, leaving them to retire into their peaceful
dreams and pious dissipations once more.</p>
<p>On the 8th of last September, Admiral de Horsey, commander-in-chief
of the British fleet in the Pacific, visited Pitcairn’s Island, and
speaks as follows in his official report to the admiralty:</p>
<p>They have beans, carrots, turnips, cabbages, and a little maize;
pineapples, fig trees, custard-apples, and oranges; lemons, and
cocoanuts. Clothing is obtained alone from passing ships, in barter for
refreshments. There are no springs on the island, but as it rains
generally once a month they have plenty of water, although at times in
former years they have suffered from drought. No alcoholic liquors,
except for medicinal purposes, are used, and a drunkard is unknown….</p>
<p>The necessary articles required by the islanders are best shown by
those we furnished in barter for refreshments: namely, flannel, serge,
drill, half-boots, combs, tobacco, and soap. They also stand much in
need of maps and slates for their school, and tools of any kind are most
acceptable. I caused them to be supplied from the public stores with a
Union jack: for display on the arrival of ships, and a pit-saw, of which
they were greatly in need. This, I trust, will meet the approval of
their lordships. If the munificent people of England were only aware of
the wants of this most deserving little colony, they would not long go
unsupplied….</p>
<p>Divine service is held every Sunday at 10.30 A.M. and at 3 P.M., in
the house built and used by John Adams for that purpose until he died in
1829. It is conducted strictly in accordance with the liturgy of the
Church of England, by Mr. Simon Young, their selected pastor, who is
much respected. A Bible class is held every Wednesday, when all who
conveniently can attend. There is also a general meeting for prayer on
the first Friday in every month. Family prayers are said in every house
the first thing in the morning and the last thing in the evening, and no
food is partaken of without asking God’s blessing before and afterward.
Of these islanders’ religious attributes no one can speak without deep
respect. A people whose greatest pleasure and privilege is to commune in
prayer with their God, and to join in hymns of praise, and who are,
moreover, cheerful, diligent, and probably freer from vice than any
other community, need no priest among them.</p>
<p>Now I come to a sentence in the admiral’s report which he dropped
carelessly from his pen, no doubt, and never gave the matter a second
thought. He little imagined what a freight of tragic prophecy it bore!
This is the sentence:</p>
<p>One stranger, an American, has settled on the island–a doubtful
acquisition.</p>
<p>A doubtful acquisition, indeed! Captain Ormsby, in the American ship
Hornet, touched at Pitcairn’s nearly four months after the admiral’s
visit, and from the facts which he gathered there we now know all about
that American. Let us put these facts together in historical form. The
American’s name was Butterworth Stavely. As soon as he had become well
acquainted with all the people–and this took but a few days, of course
–he began to ingratiate himself with them by all the arts he could
command. He became exceedingly popular, and much looked up to; for one
of the first things he did was to forsake his worldly way of life, and
throw all his energies into religion. He was always reading his Bible,
or praying, or singing hymns, or asking blessings. In prayer, no one had
such “liberty“ as he, no one could pray so long or so well.</p>
<p>At last, when he considered the time to be ripe, he began secretly to
sow the seeds of discontent among the people. It was his deliberate
purpose, from the beginning, to subvert the government, but of course he
kept that to himself for a time. He used different arts with different
individuals. He awakened dissatisfaction in one quarter by calling
attention to the shortness of the Sunday services; he argued that there
should be three three-hour services on Sunday instead of only two. Many
had secretly held this opinion before; they now privately banded
themselves into a party to work for it. He showed certain of the women
that they were not allowed sufficient voice in the prayer-meetings; thus
another party was formed. No weapon was beneath his notice; he even
descended to the children, and awoke discontent in their breasts
because–as he discovered for them–they had not enough Sunday-school.
This created a third party.</p>
<p>Now, as the chief of these parties, he found himself the strongest
power in the community. So he proceeded to his next move–a no less
important one than the impeachment of the chief magistrate, James
Russell Nickoy; a man of character and ability, and possessed of great
wealth, he being the owner of a house with a parlor to it, three acres
and a half of yam-land, and the only boat in Pitcairn’s, a whaleboat;
and, most unfortunately, a pretext for this impeachment offered itself
at just the right time.</p>
<p>One of the earliest and most precious laws of the island was the law
against trespass. It was held in great reverence, and was regarded as
the palladium of the people’s liberties. About thirty years ago an
important case came before the courts under this law, in this wise: a
chicken belonging to Elizabeth Young (aged, at that time, fifty-eight, a
daughter of John Mills, one of the mutineers of the Bounty) trespassed
upon the grounds of Thursday October Christian (aged twenty-nine, a
grandson of Fletcher Christian, one of the mutineers). Christian killed
the chicken. According to the law, Christian could keep the chicken; or,
if he preferred, he could restore its remains to the owner and receive
damages in “produce“ to an amount equivalent to the waste and injury
wrought by the trespasser. The court records set forth that “the said
Christian aforesaid did deliver the aforesaid remains to the said Eliza
beth Young, and did demand one bushel of yams in satisfaction of the
damage done.“ But Elizabeth Young considered the demand exorbitant; the
parties could not agree; therefore Christian brought suit in the courts.
He lost his case in the justice’s court; at least, he was awarded only a
half-peck of yams, which he considered insufficient, and in the nature
of a defeat. He appealed. The case lingered several years in an
ascending grade of courts, and always resulted in decrees sustaining the
original verdict; and finally the thing got into the supreme court, and
there it stuck for twenty years. But last summer, even the supreme court
managed to arrive at a decision at last. Once more the original verdict
was sustained. Christian then said he was satisfied; but Stavely was
present, and whispered to him and to his lawyer, suggesting, “as a mere
form,“ that the original law be exhibited, in order to make sure that it
still existed. It seemed an odd idea, but an ingenious one. So the
demand was made. A messenger was sent to the magistrate’s house; he
presently returned with the tidings that it had disappeared from among
the state archives.</p>
<p>The court now pronounced its late decision void, since it had been
made under a law which had no actual existence.</p>
<p>Great excitement ensued immediately. The news swept abroad over the
whole island that the palladium of the public liberties was lost–maybe
treasonably destroyed. Within thirty minutes almost the entire nation
were in the court-room–that is to say, the church. The impeachment of
the chief magistrate followed, upon Stavely’s motion. The accused met
his misfortune with the dignity which became his great office. He did
not plead, or even argue; he offered the simple defense that he had not
meddled with the missing law; that he had kept the state archives in the
same candle-box that had been used as their depository from the
beginning; and that he was innocent of the removal or destruction of the
lost document.</p>
<p>But nothing could save him; he was found guilty of misprision of
treason, and degraded from his office, and all his property was
confiscated.</p>
<p>The lamest part of the whole shameful matter was the reason suggested
by his enemies for his destruction of the law, to wit: that he did it to
favor Christian, because Christian was his cousin! Whereas Stavely was
the only individual in the entire nation who was not his cousin. The
reader must remember that all these people are the descendants of half a
dozen men; that the first children intermarried together and bore
grandchildren to the mutineers; that these grandchildren intermarried;
after them, great and great-great-grandchildren intermarried; so that
to-day everybody is blood kin to everybody. Moreover, the relationships
are wonderfully, even astoundingly, mixed up and complicated. A
stranger, for instance, says to an islander:</p>
<p>“You speak of that young woman as your cousin; a while ago you called
her your aunt.“</p>
<p>“Well, she is my aunt, and my cousin, too. And also my stepsister, my
niece, my fourth cousin, my thirty-third cousin, my forty-second cousin,
my great-aunt, my grandmother, my widowed sister-in-law–and next week
she will be my wife.“</p>
<p>So the charge of nepotism against the chief magistrate was weak. But
no matter; weak or strong, it suited Stavely. Stavely was immediately
elected to the vacant magistracy, and, oozing reform from every pore, he
went vigorously to work. In no long time religious services raged
everywhere and unceasingly. By command, the second prayer of the Sunday
morning service, which had customarily endured some thirty-five or forty
minutes, and had pleaded for the world, first by continent and then by
national and tribal detail, was extended to an hour and a half, and made
to include supplications in behalf of the possible peoples in the
several planets. Everybody was pleased with this; everybody said, “Now
this is something like.“ By command, the usual three-hour sermons were
doubled in length. The nation came in a body to testify their gratitude
to the new magistrate. The old law forbidding cooking on the Sabbath was
extended to the prohibition of eating, also. By command, Sunday-school
was privileged to spread over into the week. The joy of all classes was
complete. In one short month the new magistrate had become the people’s
idol!</p>
<p>The time was ripe for this man’s next move. He began, cautiously at
first, to poison the public mind against England. He took the chief
citizens aside, one by one, and conversed with them on this topic.
Presently he grew bolder, and spoke out. He said the nation owed it to
itself, to its honor, to its great traditions, to rise in its might and
throw off “this galling English yoke.“</p>
<p>But the simple islanders answered:</p>
<p>“We had not noticed that it galled. How does it gall? England sends a
ship once in three or four years to give us soap and clothing, and
things which we sorely need and gratefully receive; but she never
troubles us; she lets us go our own way.“</p>
<p>“She lets you go your own way! So slaves have felt and spoken in all
the ages! This speech shows how fallen you are, how base, how brutalized
you have become, under this grinding tyranny! What! has all manly pride
forsaken you? Is liberty nothing? Are you content to be a mere appendage
to a foreign and hateful sovereignty, when you might rise up and take
your rightful place in the august family of nations, great, free,
enlightened, independent, the minion of no sceptered master, but the
arbiter of your own destiny, and a voice and a power in decreeing the
destinies of your sister-sovereignties of the world?“</p>
<p>Speeches like this produced an effect by and by. Citizens began to
feel the English yoke; they did not know exactly how or whereabouts they
felt it, but they were perfectly certain they did feel it. They got to
grumbling a good deal, and chafing under their chains, and longing for
relief and release. They presently fell to hating the English flag, that
sign and symbol of their nation’s degradation; they ceased to glance up
at it as they passed the capitol, but averted their eyes and grated
their teeth; and one morning, when it was found trampled into the mud at
the foot of the staff, they left it there, and no man put his hand to it
to hoist it again. A certain thing which was sure to happen sooner or
later happened now. Some of the chief citizens went to the magistrate by
night, and said:</p>
<p>“We can endure this hated tyranny no longer. How can we cast it
off?“</p>
<p>“By a coup d’etat.“</p>
<p>“How?“</p>
<p>“A coup d’etat. It is like this: everything is got ready, and at the
appointed moment I, as the official head of the nation, publicly and
solemnly proclaim its independence, and absolve it from allegiance to
any and all other powers whatsoever.“</p>
<p>“That sounds simple and easy. We can do that right away. Then what
will be the next thing to do?“</p>
<p>“Seize all the defenses and public properties of all kinds, establish
martial law, put the army and navy on a war footing, and proclaim the
empire!“</p>
<p>This fine program dazzled these innocents. They said:</p>
<p>“This is grand–this is splendid; but will not England resist?“</p>
<p>“Let her. This rock is a Gibraltar.“</p>
<p>“True. But about the empire? Do we need an empire and an
emperor?“</p>
<p>“What you need, my friends, is unification. Look at Germany; look at
Italy. They are unified. Unification is the thing. It makes living dear.
That constitutes progress. We must have a standing army and a navy.
Taxes follow, as a matter of course. All these things summed up make
grandeur. With unification and grandeur, what more can you want? Very
well–only the empire can confer these boons.“</p>
<p>So on the 8th day of December Pitcairn’s Island was proclaimed a free
and independent nation; and on the same day the solemn coronation of
Butterworth I, Emperor of Pitcairn’s Island, took place, amid great
rejoicings and festivities. The entire nation, with the exception of
fourteen persons, mainly little children, marched past the throne in
single file, with banners and music, the procession being upward of
ninety feet long; and some said it was as much as three-quarters of a
minute passing a given point. Nothing like it had ever been seen in the
history of the island before. Public enthusiasm was measureless.</p>
<p>Now straightway imperial reforms began. Orders of nobility were
instituted. A minister of the navy was appointed, and the whale-boat put
in commission. A minister of war was created, and ordered to proceed at
once with the formation of a standing army. A first lord of the treasury
was named, and commanded to get up a taxation scheme, and also open
negotiations for treaties, offensive, defensive, and commercial, with
foreign powers. Some generals and admirals were appointed; also some
chamberlains, some equerries in waiting, and some lords of the
bedchamber.</p>
<p>At this point all the material was used up. The Grand Duke of
Galilee, minister of war, complained that all the sixteen grown men in
the empire had been given great offices, and consequently would not
consent to serve in the ranks; wherefore his standing army was at a
standstill. The Marquis of Ararat, minister of the navy, made a similar
complaint. He said he was willing to steer the whale-boat himself, but
he must have somebody to man her.</p>
<p>The emperor did the best he could in the circumstances: he took all
the boys above the age of ten years away from their mothers, and pressed
them into the army, thus constructing a corps of seventeen privates,
officered by one lieutenant-general and two major-generals. This pleased
the minister of war, but procured the enmity of all the mothers in the
land; for they said their precious ones must now find bloody graves in
the fields of war, and he would be answerable for it. Some of the more
heartbroken and unappeasable among them lay constantly wait for the
emperor and threw yams at him, unmindful of the body-guard.</p>
<p>On account of the extreme scarcity of material, it was found
necessary to require the Duke of Bethany postmaster-general, to pull
stroke-oar in the navy and thus sit in the rear of a noble of lower
degree namely, Viscount Canaan, lord justice of the common pleas. This
turned the Duke of Bethany into tolerably open malcontent and a secret
conspirator–a thing which the emperor foresaw, but could not help.</p>
<p>Things went from bad to worse. The emperor raised Nancy Peters to the
peerage on one day, and married her the next, notwithstanding, for
reasons of state, the cabinet had strenuously advised him to marry
Emmeline, eldest daughter of the Archbishop of Bethlehem. This caused
trouble in a powerful quarter–the church. The new empress secured the
support and friendship of two-thirds of the thirty-six grown women in
the nation by absorbing them into her court as maids of honor; but this
made deadly enemies of the remaining twelve. The families of the maids
of honor soon began to rebel, because there was nobody at home to keep
house. The twelve snubbed women refused to enter the imperial kitchen as
servants; so the empress had to require the Countess of Jericho and
other great court dames to fetch water, sweep the palace, and perform
other menial and equally distasteful services. This made bad blood in
that department.</p>
<p>Everybody fell to complaining that the taxes levied for the support
of the army, the navy, and the rest of the imperial establishment were
intolerably burdensome, and were reducing the nation to beggary. The
emperor’s reply–“Look–Look at Germany; look at Italy. Are you better
than they? and haven’t you unification?“—did not satisfy them. They
said, “People can’t eat unification, and we are starving. Agriculture
has ceased. Everybody is in the army, everybody is in the navy,
everybody is in the public service, standing around in a uniform, with
nothing whatever to do, nothing to eat, and nobody to till the
fields–“</p>
<p>“Look at Germany; look at Italy. It is the same there. Such is
unification, and there’s no other way to get it–no other way to keep it
after you’ve got it,“ said the poor emperor always.</p>
<p>But the grumblers only replied, “We can’t stand the taxes–we can’t
stand them.“</p>
<p>Now right on top of this the cabinet reported a national debt
amounting to upward of forty-five dollars–half a dollar to every
individual in the nation. And they proposed to fund something. They had
heard that this was always done in such emergencies. They proposed
duties on exports; also on imports. And they wanted to issue bonds; also
paper money, redeemable in yams and cabbages in fifty years. They said
the pay of the army and of the navy and of the whole governmental
machine was far in arrears, and unless something was done, and done
immediately, national bankruptcy must ensue, and possibly insurrection
and revolution. The emperor at once resolved upon a high-handed measure,
and one of a nature never before heard of in Pitcairn’s Island. He went
in state to the church on Sunday morning, with the army at his back, and
commanded the minister of the treasury to take up a collection.</p>
<p>That was the feather that broke the camel’s back. First one citizen,
and then another, rose and refused to submit to this unheard-of outrage
–and each refusal was followed by the immediate confiscation of the
malcontent’s property. This vigor soon stopped the refusals, and the
collection proceeded amid a sullen and ominous silence. As the emperor
withdrew with the troops, he said, “I will teach you who is master
here.“ Several persons shouted, “Down with unification!“ They were at
once arrested and torn from the arms of their weeping friends by the
soldiery.</p>
<p>But in the mean time, as any prophet might have foreseen, a Social
Democrat had been developed. As the emperor stepped into the gilded
imperial wheelbarrow at the church door, the social democrat stabbed at
him fifteen or sixteen times with a harpoon, but fortunately with such a
peculiarly social democratic unprecision of aim as to do no damage.</p>
<p>That very night the convulsion came. The nation rose as one
man–though forty-nine of the revolutionists were of the other sex. The
infantry threw down their pitchforks; the artillery cast aside their
cocoanuts; the navy revolted; the emperor was seized, and bound hand and
foot in his palace. He was very much depressed. He said:</p>
<p>“I freed you from a grinding tyranny; I lifted you up out of your
degradation, and made you a nation among nations; I gave you a strong,
compact, centralized government; and, more than all, I gave you the
blessing of blessings–unification. I have done all this, and my reward
is hatred, insult, and these bonds. Take me; do with me as you will. I
here resign my crown and all my dignities, and gladly do I release
myself from their too heavy burden. For your sake I took them up; for
your sake I lay them down. The imperial jewel is no more; now bruise and
defile as ye will the useless setting.“</p>
<p>By a unanimous voice the people condemned the ex-emperor and the
social democrat to perpetual banishment from church services, or to
perpetual labor as galley-slaves in the whale-boat–whichever they might
prefer. The next day the nation assembled again, and rehoisted the
British flag, reinstated the British tyranny, reduced the nobility to
the condition of commoners again, and then straightway turned their
diligent attention to the weeding of the ruined and neglected yam
patches, and the rehabilitation of the old useful industries and the old
healing and solacing pieties. The ex-emperor restored the lost trespass
law, and explained that he had stolen it not to injure any one, but to
further his political projects. Therefore the nation gave the late chief
magistrate his office again, and also his alienated Property.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, the ex-emperor and the social democrat chose
perpetual banishment from religious services in preference to perpetual
labor as galley slaves “with perpetual religious services,“ as they
phrased it; wherefore the people believed that the poor fellows’
troubles had unseated their reason, and so they judged it best to
confine them for the present. Which they did.</p>
<p>Such is the history of Pitcairn’s “doubtful acquisition.“</p>
<p>THE CANVASSER’S TALE</p>
<p>Poor, sad-eyed stranger! There was that about his humble mien, his
tired look, his decayed-gentility clothes, that almost reached the
mustard, seed of charity that still remained, remote and lonely, in the
empty vastness of my heart, notwithstanding I observed a portfolio under
his arm, and said to myself, Behold, Providence hath delivered his
servant into the hands of another canvasser.</p>
<p>Well, these people always get one interested. Before I well knew how
it came about, this one was telling me his history, and I was all
attention and sympathy. He told it something like this:</p>
<p>My parents died, alas, when I was a little, sinless child. My uncle
Ithuriel took me to his heart and reared me as his own. He was my only
relative in the wide world; but he was good and rich and generous. He
reared me in the lap of luxury. I knew no want that money could
satisfy.</p>
<p>In the fullness of time I was graduated, and went with two of my
servants–my chamberlain and my valet–to travel in foreign countries.
During four years I flitted upon careless wing amid the beauteous
gardens of the distant strand, if you will permit this form of speech in
one whose tongue was ever attuned to poesy; and indeed I so speak with
confidence, as one unto his kind, for I perceive by your eyes that you
too, sir, are gifted with the divine inflation. In those far lands I
reveled in the ambrosial food that fructifies the soul, the mind, the
heart. But of all things, that which most appealed to my inborn esthetic
taste was the prevailing custom there, among the rich, of making
collections of elegant and costly rarities, dainty objets de vertu, and
in an evil hour I tried to uplift my uncle Ithuriel to a plane of
sympathy with this exquisite employment.</p>
<p>I wrote and told him of one gentleman’s vast collection of shells;
another’s noble collection of meerschaum pipes; another’s elevating and
refining collection of undecipherable autographs; another’s priceless
collection of old china; another’s enchanting collection of
postage-stamps–and so forth and so on. Soon my letters yielded fruit. My
uncle began to look about for something to make a collection of. You may
know, perhaps, how fleetly a taste like this dilates. His soon became a
raging fever, though I knew it not. He began to neglect his great pork
business; presently he wholly retired and turned an elegant leisure into
a rabid search for curious things. His wealth was vast, and he spared it
not. First he tried cow-bells. He made a collection which filled five
large salons, and comprehended all the different sorts of cow-bells that
ever had been contrived, save one. That one–an antique, and the only
specimen extant–was possessed by another collector. My uncle offered
enormous sums for it, but the gentleman would not sell. Doubtless you
know what necessarily resulted. A true collector attaches no value to a
collection that is not complete. His great heart breaks, he sells his
hoard, he turns his mind to some field that seems unoccupied.</p>
<p>Thus did my uncle. He next tried brickbats. After piling up a vast
and intensely interesting collection, the former difficulty supervened;
his great heart broke again; he sold out his soul’s idol to the retired
brewer who possessed the missing brick. Then he tried flint hatchets and
other implements of Primeval Man, but by and by discovered that the
factory where they were made was supplying other collectors as well as
himself. He tried Aztec inscriptions and stuffed whales–another failure,
after incredible labor and expense. When his collection seemed at last
perfect, a stuffed whale arrived from Greenland and an Aztec inscription
from the Cundurango regions of Central America that made all former
specimens insignificant. My uncle hastened to secure these noble gems.
He got the stuffed whale, but another collector got the inscription. A
real Cundurango, as possibly you know, is a possession of such supreme
value that, when once a collector gets it, he will rather part with his
family than with it. So my uncle sold out, and saw his darlings go
forth, never more to return; and his coal-black hair turned white as
snow in a single night.</p>
<p>Now he waited, and thought. He knew another disappointment might kill
him. He was resolved that he would choose things next time that no other
man was collecting. He carefully made up his mind, and once more entered
the field-this time to make a collection of echoes.</p>
<p>“Of what?“ said I.</p>
<p>Echoes, sir. His first purchase was an echo in Georgia that repeated
four times; his next was a six-repeater in Maryland; his next was a
thirteen-repeater in Maine; his next was a nine-repeater in Kansas; his
next was a twelve-repeater in Tennessee, which he got cheap, so to
speak, because it was out of repair, a portion of the crag which
reflected it having tumbled down. He believed he could repair it at a
cost of a few thousand dollars, and, by increasing the elevation with
masonry, treble the repeating capacity; but the architect who undertook
the job had never built an echo before, and so he utterly spoiled this
one. Before he meddled with it, it used to talk back like a
mother-in-law, but now it was only fit for the deaf-and-dumb asylum.
Well, next he bought a lot of cheap little double-barreled echoes,
scattered around over various states and territories; he got them at
twenty per cent. off by taking the lot. Next he bought a perfect
Gatling-gun of an echo in Oregon, and it cost a fortune, I can tell you.
You may know, sir, that in the echo market the scale of prices is
cumulative, like the carat-scale in diamonds; in fact, the same
phraseology is used. A single-carat echo is worth but ten dollars over
and above the value of the land it is on; a two-carat or double-barreled
echo is worth thirty dollars; a five-carat is worth nine hundred and
fifty; a ten-carat is worth thirteen thousand. My uncle’s Oregon-echo,
which he called the Great Pitt Echo, was a twenty-two carat gem, and
cost two hundred and sixteen thousand dollars–they threw the land in,
for it was four hundred miles from a settlement.</p>
<p>Well, in the mean time my path was a path of roses. I was the
accepted suitor of the only and lovely daughter of an English earl, and
was beloved to distraction. In that dear presence I swam in seas of
bliss. The family were content, for it was known that I was sole heir to
an uncle held to be worth five millions of dollars. However, none of us
knew that my uncle had become a collector, at least in anything more
than a small way, for esthetic amusement.</p>
<p>Now gathered the clouds above my unconscious head. That divine echo,
since known throughout the world as the Great Koh-i-noor, or Mountain of
Repetitions, was discovered. It was a sixty-five carat gem. You could
utter a word and it would talk back at you for fifteen minutes, when the
day was otherwise quiet. But behold, another fact came to light at the
same time: another echo-collector was in the field. The two rushed to
make the peerless purchase. The property consisted of a couple of small
hills with a shallow swale between, out yonder among the back
settlements of New York State. Both men arrived on the ground at the
same time, and neither knew the other was there. The echo was not all
owned by one man; a person by the name of Williamson Bolivar Jarvis
owned the east hill, and a person by the name of Harbison J. Bledso
owned the west hill; the swale between was the dividing-line. So while
my uncle was buying Jarvis’s hill for three million two hundred and
eighty-five thousand dollars, the other party was buying Bledso’s hill
for a shade over three million.</p>
<p>Now, do you perceive the natural result? Why, the noblest collection
of echoes on earth was forever and ever incomplete, since it possessed
but the one-half of the king echo of the universe. Neither man was
content with this divided ownership, yet neither would sell to the
other. There were jawings, bickerings, heart-burnings. And at last that
other collector, with a malignity which only a collector can ever feel
toward a man and a brother, proceeded to cut down his hill!</p>
<p>You see, as long as he could not have the echo, he was resolved that
nobody should have it. He would remove his hill, and then there would be
nothing to reflect my uncle’s echo. My uncle remonstrated with him, but
the man said, “I own one end of this echo; I choose to kill my end; you
must take care of your own end yourself.“</p>
<p>Well, my uncle got an injunction put an him. The other man appealed
and fought it in a higher court. They carried it on up, clear to the
Supreme Court of the United States. It made no end of trouble there. Two
of the judges believed that an echo was personal property, because it
was impalpable to sight and touch, and yet was purchasable, salable, and
consequently taxable; two others believed that an echo was real estate,
because it was manifestly attached to the land, and was not removable
from place to place; other of the judges contended that an echo was not
property at all.</p>
<p>It was finally decided that the echo was property; that the hills
were property; that the two men were separate and independent owners of
the two hills, but tenants in common in the echo; therefore defendant
was at full liberty to cut down his hill, since it belonged solely to
him, but must give bonds in three million dollars as indemnity for
damages which might result to my uncle’s half of the echo. This decision
also debarred my uncle from using defendant’s hill to reflect his part
of the echo, without defendant’s consent; he must use only his own hill;
if his part of the echo would not go, under these circumstances, it was
sad, of course, but the court could find no remedy. The court also
debarred defendant from using my uncle’s hill to reflect his end of the
echo, without consent. You see the grand result! Neither man would give
consent, and so that astonishing and most noble echo had to cease from
its great powers; and since that day that magnificent property is tied
up and unsalable.</p>
<p>A week before my wedding-day, while I was still swimming in bliss and
the nobility were gathering from far and near to honor our espousals,
came news of my uncle’s death, and also a copy of his will, making me
his sole heir. He was gone; alas, my dear benefactor was no more. The
thought surcharges my heart even at this remote day. I handed the will
to the earl; I could not read it for the blinding tears. The earl read
it; then he sternly said, “Sir, do you call this wealth?–but doubtless
you do in your inflated country. Sir, you are left sole heir to a vast
collection of echoes–if a thing can be called a collection that is
scattered far and wide over the huge length and breadth of the American
continent; sir, this is not all; you are head and ears in debt; there is
not an echo in the lot but has a mortgage on it; sir, I am not a hard
man, but I must look to my child’s interest; if you had but one echo
which you could honestly call your own, if you had but one echo which
was free from incumbrance, so that you could retire to it with my child,
and by humble, painstaking industry cultivate and improve it, and thus
wrest from it a maintenance, I would not say you nay; but I cannot marry
my child to a beggar. Leave his side, my darling; go, sir, take your
mortgage-ridden echoes and quit my sight forever.“</p>
<p>My noble Celestine clung to me in tears, with loving arms, and swore
she would willingly, nay gladly, marry me, though I had not an echo in
the world. But it could not be. We were torn asunder, she to pine and
die within the twelvemonth, I to toil life’s long journey sad and alone,
praying daily, hourly, for that release which shall join us together
again in that dear realm where the wicked cease from troubling and the
weary are at rest. Now, sir, if you will be so kind as to look at these
maps and plans in my portfolio, I am sure I can sell you an echo for
less money than any man in the trade. Now this one, which cost my uncle
ten dollars, thirty years ago, and is one of the sweetest things in
Texas, I will let you have for–</p>
<p>“Let me interrupt you,“ I said. “My friend, I have not had a moment’s
respite from canvassers this day. I have bought a sewing-machine which I
did not want; I have bought a map which is mistaken in all its details;
I have bought a clock which will not go; I have bought a moth poison
which the moths prefer to any other beverage; I have bought no end of
useless inventions, and now I have had enough of this foolishness. I
would not have one of your echoes if you were even to give it to me. I
would not let it stay on the place. I always hate a man that tries to
sell me echoes. You see this gun? Now take your collection and move on;
let us not have bloodshed.“</p>
<p>But he only smiled a sad, sweet smile, and got out some more
diagrams. You know the result perfectly well, because you know that when
you have once opened the door to a canvasser, the trouble is done and
you have got to suffer defeat.</p>
<p>I compromised with this man at the end of an intolerable hour. I
bought two double-barreled echoes in good condition, and he threw in
another, which he said was not salable because it only spoke German. He
said, “She was a perfect polyglot once, but somehow her palate got
down.“</p>
