<h4 id="riley-newspaper-correspondent">RILEY-NEWSPAPER
CORRESPONDENT</h4>
<p>One of the best men in Washington–or elsewhere–is RILEY,
correspondent of one of the great San Francisco dailies.</p>
<p>Riley is full of humor, and has an unfailing vein of irony, which
makes his conversation to the last degree entertaining (as long as the
remarks are about somebody else). But notwithstanding the possession of
these qualities, which should enable a man to write a happy and an
appetizing letter, Riley’s newspaper letters often display a more than
earthly solemnity, and likewise an unimaginative devotion to petrified
facts, which surprise and distress all men who know him in his
unofficial character. He explains this curious thing by saying that his
employers sent him to Washington to write facts, not fancy, and that
several times he has come near losing his situation by inserting
humorous remarks which, not being looked for at headquarters, and
consequently not understood, were thought to be dark and bloody speeches
intended to convey signals and warnings to murderous secret societies,
or something of that kind, and so were scratched out with a shiver and a
prayer and cast into the stove. Riley says that sometimes he is so
afflicted with a yearning to write a sparkling and absorbingly readable
letter that he simply cannot resist it, and so he goes to his den and
revels in the delight of untrammeled scribbling; and then, with
suffering such as only a mother can know, he destroys the pretty
children of his fancy and reduces his letter to the required dismal
accuracy. Having seen Riley do this very thing more than once, I know
whereof I speak. Often I have laughed with him over a happy passage, and
grieved to see him plow his pen through it. He would say, “I had to
write that or die; and I’ve got to scratch it out or starve. They
wouldn’t stand it, you know.“</p>
<p>I think Riley is about the most entertaining company I ever saw. We
lodged together in many places in Washington during the winter of ’67-8,
moving comfortably from place to place, and attracting attention by
paying our board–a course which cannot fail to make a person conspicuous
in Washington. Riley would tell all about his trip to California in the
early days, by way of the Isthmus and the San Juan River; and about his
baking bread in San Francisco to gain a living, and setting up tenpins,
and practising law, and opening oysters, and delivering lectures, and
teaching French, and tending bar, and reporting for the newspapers, and
keeping dancing-schools, and interpreting Chinese in the courts–which
latter was lucrative, and Riley was doing handsomely and laying up a
little money when people began to find fault because his translations
were too “free,“ a thing for which Riley considered he ought not to be
held responsible, since he did not know a word of the Chinese tongue,
and only adopted interpreting as a means of gaining an honest
livelihood. Through the machinations of enemies he was removed from the
position of official interpreter, and a man put in his place who was
familiar with the Chinese language, but did not know any English. And
Riley used to tell about publishing a newspaper up in what is Alaska
now, but was only an iceberg then, with a population composed of bears,
walruses, Indians, and other animals; and how the iceberg got adrift at
last, and left all his paying subscribers behind, and as soon as the
commonwealth floated out of the jurisdiction of Russia the people rose
and threw off their allegiance and ran up the English flag, calculating
to hook on and become an English colony as they drifted along down the
British Possessions; but a land breeze and a crooked current carried
them by, and they ran up the Stars and Stripes and steered for
California, missed the connection again and swore allegiance to Mexico,
but it wasn’t any use; the anchors came home every time, and away they
went with the northeast trades drifting off sideways toward the Sandwich
Islands, whereupon they ran up the Cannibal flag and had a grand human
barbecue in honor of it, in which it was noticed that the better a man
liked a friend the better he enjoyed him; and as soon as they got fairly
within the tropics the weather got so fearfully hot that the iceberg
began to melt, and it got so sloppy under foot that it was almost
impossible for ladies to get about at all; and at last, just as they
came in sight of the islands, the melancholy remnant of the once
majestic iceberg canted first to one side and then to the other, and
then plunged under forever, carrying the national archives along with
it–and not only the archives and the populace, but some eligible town
lots which had increased in value as fast as they diminished in size in
the tropics, and which Riley could have sold at thirty cents a pound and
made himself rich if he could have kept the province afloat ten hours
longer and got her into port.</p>
<p>Riley is very methodical, untiringly accommodating, never forgets
anything that is to be attended to, is a good son, a stanch friend, and
a permanent reliable enemy. He will put himself to any amount of trouble
to oblige a body, and therefore always has his hands full of things to
be done for the helpless and the shiftless. And he knows how to do
nearly everything, too. He is a man whose native benevolence is a
well-spring that never goes dry. He stands always ready to help whoever
needs help, as far as he is able–and not simply with his money, for that
is a cheap and common charity, but with hand and brain, and fatigue of
limb and sacrifice of time. This sort of men is rare.</p>
<p>Riley has a ready wit, a quickness and aptness at selecting and
applying quotations, and a countenance that is as solemn and as blank as
the back side of a tombstone when he is delivering a particularly
exasperating joke. One night a negro woman was burned to death in a
house next door to us, and Riley said that our landlady would be
oppressively emotional at breakfast, because she generally made use of
such opportunities as offered, being of a morbidly sentimental turn, and
so we should find it best to let her talk along and say nothing back–it
was the only way to keep her tears out of the gravy. Riley said there
never was a funeral in the neighborhood but that the gravy was watery
for a week.</p>
<p>And, sure enough, at breakfast the landlady was down in the very
sloughs of woe–entirely brokenhearted. Everything she looked at reminded
her of that poor old negro woman, and so the buckwheat cakes made her
sob, the coffee forced a groan, and when the beefsteak came on she
fetched a wail that made our hair rise. Then she got to talking about
deceased, and kept up a steady drizzle till both of us were soaked
through and through. Presently she took a fresh breath and said, with a
world of sobs:</p>
<p>“Ah, to think of it, only to think of it!–the poor old faithful
creature. For she was so faithful. Would you believe it, she had been a
servant in that selfsame house and that selfsame family for twenty seven
years come Christmas, and never a cross word and never a lick! And, oh,
to think she should meet such a death at last!–a-sitting over the red
hot stove at three o’clock in the morning and went to sleep and fell on
it and was actually roasted! Not just frizzled up a bit, but literally
roasted to a crisp! Poor faithful creature, how she was cooked! I am but
a poor woman, but even if I have to scrimp to do it, I will put up a
tombstone over that lone sufferer’s grave–and Mr. Riley if you would
have the goodness to think up a little epitaph to put on it which would
sort of describe the awful way in which she met her–“</p>
<p>“Put it, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant,’“ said Riley, and
never smiled.</p>
