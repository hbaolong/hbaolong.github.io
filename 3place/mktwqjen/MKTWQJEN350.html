<h4 id="chapter-l-titian-bad-and-titian-good">Chapter L [Titian Bad and
Titian Good]</h4>
<p>I wonder why some things are? For instance, Art is allowed as much
indecent license today as in earlier times –but the privileges of
Literature in this respect have been sharply curtailed within the past
eighty or ninety years. Fielding and Smollett could portray the
beastliness of their day in the beastliest language; we have plenty of
foul subjects to deal with in our day, but we are not allowed to
approach them very near, even with nice and guarded forms of speech. But
not so with Art. The brush may still deal freely with any subject,
however revolting or indelicate. It makes a body ooze sarcasm at every
pore, to go about Rome and Florence and see what this last generation
has been doing with the statues. These works, which had stood in
innocent nakedness for ages, are all fig-leaved now. Yes, every one of
them. Nobody noticed their nakedness before, perhaps; nobody can help
noticing it now, the fig-leaf makes it so conspicuous. But the comical
thing about it all, is, that the fig-leaf is confined to cold and pallid
marble, which would be still cold and unsuggestive without this sham and
ostentatious symbol of modesty, whereas warm-blood paintings which do
really need it have in no case been furnished with it.</p>
<p>At the door of the Uffizzi, in Florence, one is confronted by statues
of a man and a woman, noseless, battered, black with accumulated
grime–they hardly suggest human beings –yet these ridiculous creatures
have been thoughtfully and conscientiously fig-leaved by this fastidious
generation. You enter, and proceed to that most-visited little gallery
that exists in the world–the Tribune–and there, against the wall,
without obstructing rag or leaf, you may look your fill upon the
foulest, the vilest, the obscenest picture the world possesses–Titian’s
Venus. It isn’t that she is naked and stretched out on a bed–no, it is
the attitude of one of her arms and hand. If I ventured to describe that
attitude, there would be a fine howl–but there the Venus lies, for
anybody to gloat over that wants to–and there she has a right to lie,
for she is a work of art, and Art has its privileges. I saw young girls
stealing furtive glances at her; I saw young men gaze long and
absorbedly at her; I saw aged, infirm men hang upon her charms with a
pathetic interest. How I should like to describe her–just to see what a
holy indignation I could stir up in the world–just to hear the
unreflecting average man deliver himself about my grossness and
coarseness, and all that. The world says that no worded description of a
moving spectacle is a hundredth part as moving as the same spectacle
seen with one’s own eyes–yet the world is willing to let its son and its
daughter and itself look at Titian’s beast, but won’t stand a
description of it in words. Which shows that the world is not as
consistent as it might be.</p>
<p>There are pictures of nude women which suggest no impure thought–I am
well aware of that. I am not railing at such. What I am trying to
emphasize is the fact that Titian’s Venus is very far from being one of
that sort. Without any question it was painted for a bagnio and it was
probably refused because it was a trifle too strong. In truth, it is too
strong for any place but a public Art Gallery. Titian has two Venuses in
the Tribune; persons who have seen them will easily remember which one I
am referring to.</p>
<p>In every gallery in Europe there are hideous pictures of blood,
carnage, oozing brains, putrefaction–pictures portraying intolerable
suffering–pictures alive with every conceivable horror, wrought out in
dreadful detail–and similar pictures are being put on the canvas every
day and publicly exhibited–without a growl from anybody–for they are
innocent, they are inoffensive, being works of art. But suppose a
literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate
description of one of these grisly things–the critics would skin him
alive. Well, let it go, it cannot be helped; Art retains her privileges,
Literature has lost hers. Somebody else may cipher out the whys and the
wherefores and the consistencies of it–I haven’t got time.</p>
<p>Titian’s Venus defiles and disgraces the Tribune, there is no
softening that fact, but his “Moses“ glorifies it. The simple
truthfulness of its noble work wins the heart and the applause of every
visitor, be he learned or ignorant. After wearying one’s self with the
acres of stuffy, sappy, expressionless babies that populate the canvases
of the Old Masters of Italy, it is refreshing to stand before this
peerless child and feel that thrill which tells you you are at last in
the presence of the real thing. This is a human child, this is genuine.
You have seen him a thousand times–you have seen him just as he is here
–and you confess, without reserve, that Titian WAS a Master. The
doll-faces of other painted babes may mean one thing, they may mean
another, but with the “Moses“ the case is different. The most famous of
all the art-critics has said, “There is no room for doubt, here–plainly
this child is in trouble.“</p>
<p>I consider that the “Moses“ has no equal among the works of the Old
Masters, except it be the divine Hair Trunk of Bassano. I feel sure that
if all the other Old Masters were lost and only these two preserved, the
world would be the gainer by it.</p>
<p>My sole purpose in going to Florence was to see this immortal
“Moses,“ and by good fortune I was just in time, for they were already
preparing to remove it to a more private and better-protected place
because a fashion of robbing the great galleries was prevailing in
Europe at the time.</p>
<p>I got a capable artist to copy the picture; Pannemaker, the engraver
of Dor’e’s books, engraved it for me, and I have the pleasure of laying
it before the reader in this volume.</p>
<p>We took a turn to Rome and some other Italian cities –then to Munich,
and thence to Paris–partly for exercise, but mainly because these things
were in our projected program, and it was only right that we should be
faithful to it.</p>
<p>From Paris I branched out and walked through Holland and Belgium,
procuring an occasional lift by rail or canal when tired, and I had a
tolerably good time of it “by and large.“ I worked Spain and other
regions through agents to save time and shoe-leather.</p>
<p>We crossed to England, and then made the homeward passage in the
Cunarder GALLIA, a very fine ship. I was glad to get home–immeasurably
glad; so glad, in fact, that it did not seem possible that anything
could ever get me out of the country again. I had not enjoyed a pleasure
abroad which seemed to me to compare with the pleasure I felt in seeing
New York harbor again. Europe has many advantages which we have not, but
they do not compensate for a good many still more valuable ones which
exist nowhere but in our own country. Then we are such a homeless lot
when we are over there! So are Europeans themselves, for the matter.
They live in dark and chilly vast tombs–costly enough, maybe, but
without conveniences. To be condemned to live as the average European
family lives would make life a pretty heavy burden to the average
American family.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think that short visits to Europe are better for us
than long ones. The former preserve us from becoming Europeanized; they
keep our pride of country intact, and at the same time they intensify
our affection for our country and our people; whereas long visits have
the effect of dulling those feelings–at least in the majority of cases.
I think that one who mixes much with Americans long resident abroad must
arrive at this conclusion.</p>
<p>APPENDIX ———-</p>
<p>Nothing gives such weight and dignity to a book as an Appendix.
HERODOTUS</p>
<p>APPENDIX A The Portier</p>
<p>Omar Khay’am, the poet-prophet of Persia, writing more than eight
hundred years ago, has said:</p>
<p>“In the four parts of the earth are many that are able to write
learned books, many that are able to lead armies, and many also that are
able to govern kingdoms and empires; but few there be that can keep a
hotel.“</p>
<p>A word about the European hotel PORTIER. He is a most admirable
invention, a most valuable convenience. He always wears a conspicuous
uniform; he can always be found when he is wanted, for he sticks closely
to his post at the front door; he is as polite as a duke; he speaks from
four to ten languages; he is your surest help and refuge in time of
trouble or perplexity. He is not the clerk, he is not the landlord; he
ranks above the clerk, and represents the landlord, who is seldom seen.
Instead of going to the clerk for information, as we do at home, you go
to the portier. It is the pride of our average hotel clerk to know
nothing whatever; it is the pride of the portier to know everything. You
ask the portier at what hours the trains leave–he tells you instantly;
or you ask him who is the best physician in town; or what is the hack
tariff; or how many children the mayor has; or what days the galleries
are open, and whether a permit is required, and where you are to get it,
and what you must pay for it; or when the theaters open and close, what
the plays are to be, and the price of seats; or what is the newest thing
in hats; or how the bills of mortality average; or “who struck Billy
Patterson.“ It does not matter what you ask him: in nine cases out of
ten he knows, and in the tenth case he will find out for you before you
can turn around three times. There is nothing he will not put his hand
to. Suppose you tell him you wish to go from Hamburg to Peking by the
way of Jericho, and are ignorant of routes and prices –the next morning
he will hand you a piece of paper with the whole thing worked out on it
to the last detail. Before you have been long on European soil, you find
yourself still SAYING you are relying on Providence, but when you come
to look closer you will see that in reality you are relying on the
portier. He discovers what is puzzling you, or what is troubling you, or
what your need is, before you can get the half of it out, and he
promptly says, “Leave that to me.“ Consequently, you easily drift into
the habit of leaving everything to him. There is a certain embarrassment
about applying to the average American hotel clerk, a certain hesitancy,
a sense of insecurity against rebuff; but you feel no embarrassment in
your intercourse with the portier; he receives your propositions with an
enthusiasm which cheers, and plunges into their accomplishment with an
alacrity which almost inebriates. The more requirements you can pile
upon him, the better he likes it. Of course the result is that you cease
from doing anything for yourself. He calls a hack when you want one;
puts you into it; tells the driver whither to take you; receives you
like a long-lost child when you return; sends you about your business,
does all the quarreling with the hackman himself, and pays him his money
out of his own pocket. He sends for your theater tickets, and pays for
them; he sends for any possible article you can require, be it a doctor,
an elephant, or a postage stamp; and when you leave, at last, you will
find a subordinate seated with the cab-driver who will put you in your
railway compartment, buy your tickets, have your baggage weighed, bring
you the printed tags, and tell you everything is in your bill and paid
for. At home you get such elaborate, excellent, and willing service as
this only in the best hotels of our large cities; but in Europe you get
it in the mere back country-towns just as well.</p>
<p>What is the secret of the portier’s devotion? It is very simple: he
gets FEES, AND NO SALARY. His fee is pretty closely regulated, too. If
you stay a week, you give him five marks–a dollar and a quarter, or
about eighteen cents a day. If you stay a month, you reduce this average
somewhat. If you stay two or three months or longer, you cut it down
half, or even more than half. If you stay only one day, you give the
portier a mark.</p>
<p>The head waiter’s fee is a shade less than the portier’s; the Boots,
who not only blacks your boots and brushes your clothes, but is usually
the porter and handles your baggage, gets a somewhat smaller fee than
the head waiter; the chambermaid’s fee ranks below that of the Boots.
You fee only these four, and no one else. A German gentleman told me
that when he remained a week in a hotel, he gave the portier five marks,
the head waiter four, the Boots three, and the chambermaid two; and if
he stayed three months he divided ninety marks among them, in about the
above proportions. Ninety marks make 2.50.</p>
<p>None of these fees are ever paid until you leave the hotel, though it
be a year–except one of these four servants should go away in the mean
time; in that case he will be sure to come and bid you good-by and give
you the opportunity to pay him what is fairly coming to him. It is
considered very bad policy to fee a servant while you are still to
remain longer in the hotel, because if you gave him too little he might
neglect you afterward, and if you gave him too much he might neglect
somebody else to attend to you. It is considered best to keep his
expectations “on a string“ until your stay is concluded.</p>
<p>I do not know whether hotel servants in New York get any wages or
not, but I do know that in some of the hotels there the feeing system in
vogue is a heavy burden. The waiter expects a quarter at breakfast–and
gets it. You have a different waiter at luncheon, and so he gets a
quarter. Your waiter at dinner is another stranger–consequently he gets
a quarter. The boy who carries your satchel to your room and lights your
gas fumbles around and hangs around significantly, and you fee him to
get rid of him. Now you may ring for ice-water; and ten minutes later
for a lemonade; and ten minutes afterward, for a cigar; and by and by
for a newspaper–and what is the result? Why, a new boy has appeared
every time and fooled and fumbled around until you have paid him
something. Suppose you boldly put your foot down, and say it is the
hotel’s business to pay its servants? You will have to ring your bell
ten or fifteen times before you get a servant there; and when he goes
off to fill your order you will grow old and infirm before you see him
again. You may struggle nobly for twenty-four hours, maybe, if you are
an adamantine sort of person, but in the mean time you will have been so
wretchedly served, and so insolently, that you will haul down your
colors, and go to impoverishing yourself with fees.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it would be a happy idea to import the European
feeing system into America. I believe it would result in getting even
the bells of the Philadelphia hotels answered, and cheerful service
rendered.</p>
<p>The greatest American hotels keep a number of clerks and a cashier,
and pay them salaries which mount up to a considerable total in the
course of a year. The great continental hotels keep a cashier on a
trifling salary, and a portier WHO PAYS THE HOTEL A SALARY. By the
latter system both the hotel and the public save money and are better
served than by our system. One of our consuls told me that a portier of
a great Berlin hotel paid five thousand dollars a year for his position,
and yet cleared six thousand dollars for himself. The position of
portier in the chief hotels of Saratoga, Long Branch, New York, and
similar centers of resort, would be one which the holder could afford to
pay even more than five thousand dollars for, perhaps.</p>
<p>When we borrowed the feeing fashion from Europe a dozen years ago,
the salary system ought to have been discontinued, of course. We might
make this correction now, I should think. And we might add the portier,
too. Since I first began to study the portier, I have had opportunities
to observe him in the chief cities of Germany, Switzerland, and Italy;
and the more I have seen of him the more I have wished that he might be
adopted in America, and become there, as he is in Europe, the stranger’s
guardian angel.</p>
<p>Yes, what was true eight hundred years ago, is just as true today:
“Few there be that can keep a hotel.“ Perhaps it is because the
landlords and their subordinates have in too many cases taken up their
trade without first learning it. In Europe the trade of hotel-keeper is
taught. The apprentice begins at the bottom of the ladder and masters
the several grades one after the other. Just as in our country
printing-offices the apprentice first learns how to sweep out and bring
water; then learns to “roll“; then to sort “pi“; then to set type; and
finally rounds and completes his education with job-work and press-work;
so the landlord-apprentice serves as call-boy; then as under-waiter;
then as a parlor waiter; then as head waiter, in which position he often
has to make out all the bills; then as clerk or cashier; then as
portier. His trade is learned now, and by and by he will assume the
style and dignity of landlord, and be found conducting a hotel of his
own.</p>
<p>Now in Europe, the same as in America, when a man has kept a hotel so
thoroughly well during a number of years as to give it a great
reputation, he has his reward. He can live prosperously on that
reputation. He can let his hotel run down to the last degree of
shabbiness and yet have it full of people all the time. For instance,
there is the Ho^tel de Ville, in Milan. It swarms with mice and fleas,
and if the rest of the world were destroyed it could furnish dirt enough
to start another one with. The food would create an insurrection in a
poorhouse; and yet if you go outside to get your meals that hotel makes
up its loss by overcharging you on all sorts of trifles–and without
making any denials or excuses about it, either. But the Ho^tel de
Ville’s old excellent reputation still keeps its dreary rooms crowded
with travelers who would be elsewhere if they had only some wise friend
to warn them.</p>
<p>APPENDIX B Heidelberg Castle</p>
<p>Heidelberg Castle must have been very beautiful before the French
battered and bruised and scorched it two hundred years ago. The stone is
brown, with a pinkish tint, and does not seem to stain easily. The
dainty and elaborate ornamentation upon its two chief fronts is as
delicately carved as if it had been intended for the interior of a
drawing-room rather than for the outside of a house. Many fruit and
flower clusters, human heads and grim projecting lions’ heads are still
as perfect in every detail as if they were new. But the statues which
are ranked between the windows have suffered. These are life-size
statues of old-time emperors, electors, and similar grandees, clad in
mail and bearing ponderous swords. Some have lost an arm, some a head,
and one poor fellow is chopped off at the middle. There is a saying that
if a stranger will pass over the drawbridge and walk across the court to
the castle front without saying anything, he can made a wish and it will
be fulfilled. But they say that the truth of this thing has never had a
chance to be proved, for the reason that before any stranger can walk
from the drawbridge to the appointed place, the beauty of the palace
front will extort an exclamation of delight from him.</p>
<p>A ruin must be rightly situated, to be effective. This one could not
have been better placed. It stands upon a commanding elevation, it is
buried in green words, there is no level ground about it, but, on the
contrary, there are wooded terraces upon terraces, and one looks down
through shining leaves into profound chasms and abysses where twilight
reigns and the sun cannot intrude. Nature knows how to garnish a ruin to
get the best effect. One of these old towers is split down the middle,
and one half has tumbled aside. It tumbled in such a way as to establish
itself in a picturesque attitude. Then all it lacked was a fitting
drapery, and Nature has furnished that; she has robed the rugged mass in
flowers and verdure, and made it a charm to the eye. The standing half
exposes its arched and cavernous rooms to you, like open, toothless
mouths; there, too, the vines and flowers have done their work of grace.
The rear portion of the tower has not been neglected, either, but is
clothed with a clinging garment of polished ivy which hides the wounds
and stains of time. Even the top is not left bare, but is crowned with a
flourishing group of trees and shrubs. Misfortune has done for this old
tower what it has done for the human character sometimes–improved
it.</p>
<p>A gentleman remarked, one day, that it might have been fine to live
in the castle in the day of its prime, but that we had one advantage
which its vanished inhabitants lacked–the advantage of having a charming
ruin to visit and muse over. But that was a hasty idea. Those people had
the advantage of US. They had the fine castle to live in, and they could
cross the Rhine valley and muse over the stately ruin of Trifels
besides. The Trifels people, in their day, five hundred years ago, could
go and muse over majestic ruins that have vanished, now, to the last
stone. There have always been ruins, no doubt; and there have always
been pensive people to sigh over them, and asses to scratch upon them
their names and the important date of their visit. Within a hundred
years after Adam left Eden, the guide probably gave the usual general
flourish with his hand and said: “Place where the animals were named,
ladies and gentlemen; place where the tree of the forbidden fruit stood;
exact spot where Adam and Eve first met; and here, ladies and gentlemen,
adorned and hallowed by the names and addresses of three generations of
tourists, we have the crumbling remains of Cain’s altar–fine old ruin!“
Then, no doubt, he taxed them a shekel apiece and let them go.</p>
<p>An illumination of Heidelberg Castle is one of the sights of Europe.
The Castle’s picturesque shape; its commanding situation, midway up the
steep and wooded mountainside; its vast size–these features combine to
make an illumination a most effective spectacle. It is necessarily an
expensive show, and consequently rather infrequent. Therefore whenever
one of these exhibitions is to take place, the news goes about in the
papers and Heidelberg is sure to be full of people on that night. I and
my agent had one of these opportunities, and improved it.</p>
<p>About half past seven on the appointed evening we crossed the lower
bridge, with some American students, in a pouring rain, and started up
the road which borders the Neunheim side of the river. This roadway was
densely packed with carriages and foot-passengers; the former of all
ages, and the latter of all ages and both sexes. This black and solid
mass was struggling painfully onward, through the slop, the darkness,
and the deluge. We waded along for three-quarters of a mile, and finally
took up a position in an unsheltered beer-garden directly opposite the
Castle. We could not SEE the Castle–or anything else, for that
matter–but we could dimly discern the outlines of the mountain over the
way, through the pervading blackness, and knew whereabouts the Castle
was located. We stood on one of the hundred benches in the garden, under
our umbrellas; the other ninety-nine were occupied by standing men and
women, and they also had umbrellas. All the region round about, and up
and down the river-road, was a dense wilderness of humanity hidden under
an unbroken pavement of carriage tops and umbrellas. Thus we stood
during two drenching hours. No rain fell on my head, but the converging
whalebone points of a dozen neighboring umbrellas poured little cooling
steams of water down my neck, and sometimes into my ears, and thus kept
me from getting hot and impatient. I had the rheumatism, too, and had
heard that this was good for it. Afterward, however, I was led to
believe that the water treatment is NOT good for rheumatism. There were
even little girls in that dreadful place. A men held one in his arms,
just in front of me, for as much as an hour, with umbrella-drippings
soaking into her clothing all the time.</p>
<p>In the circumstances, two hours was a good while for us to have to
wait, but when the illumination did at last come, we felt repaid. It
came unexpectedly, of course–things always do, that have been long
looked and longed for. With a perfectly breath-taking suddenness several
mast sheaves of varicolored rockets were vomited skyward out of the
black throats of the Castle towers, accompanied by a thundering crash of
sound, and instantly every detail of the prodigious ruin stood revealed
against the mountainside and glowing with an almost intolerable splendor
of fire and color. For some little time the whole building was a
blinding crimson mass, the towers continued to spout thick columns of
rockets aloft, and overhead the sky was radiant with arrowy bolts which
clove their way to the zenith, paused, curved gracefully downward, then
burst into brilliant fountain-sprays of richly colored sparks. The red
fires died slowly down, within the Castle, and presently the shell grew
nearly black outside; the angry glare that shone out through the broken
arches and innumerable sashless windows, now, reproduced the aspect
which the Castle must have borne in the old time when the French
spoilers saw the monster bonfire which they had made there fading and
spoiling toward extinction.</p>
<p>While we still gazed and enjoyed, the ruin was suddenly enveloped in
rolling and rumbling volumes of vaporous green fire; then in dazzling
purple ones; then a mixture of many colors followed, then drowned the
great fabric in its blended splendors. Meantime the nearest bridge had
been illuminated, and from several rafts anchored in the river, meteor
showers of rockets, Roman candles, bombs, serpents, and Catharine wheels
were being discharged in wasteful profusion into the sky–a marvelous
sight indeed to a person as little used to such spectacles as I was. For
a while the whole region about us seemed as bright as day, and yet the
rain was falling in torrents all the time. The evening’s entertainment
presently closed, and we joined the innumerable caravan of half-drowned
strangers, and waded home again.</p>
<p>The Castle grounds are very ample and very beautiful; and as they
joined the Hotel grounds, with no fences to climb, but only some nobly
shaded stone stairways to descend, we spent a part of nearly every day
in idling through their smooth walks and leafy groves. There was an
attractive spot among the trees where were a great many wooden tables
and benches; and there one could sit in the shade and pretend to sip at
his foamy beaker of beer while he inspected the crowd. I say pretend,
because I only pretended to sip, without really sipping. That is the
polite way; but when you are ready to go, you empty the beaker at a
draught. There was a brass band, and it furnished excellent music every
afternoon. Sometimes so many people came that every seat was occupied,
every table filled. And never a rough in the assemblage–all nicely
dressed fathers and mothers, young gentlemen and ladies and children;
and plenty of university students and glittering officers; with here and
there a gray professor, or a peaceful old lady with her knitting; and
always a sprinkling of gawky foreigners. Everybody had his glass of beer
before him, or his cup of coffee, or his bottle of wine, or his hot
cutlet and potatoes; young ladies chatted, or fanned themselves, or
wrought at their crocheting or embroidering; the students fed sugar to
their dogs, or discussed duels, or illustrated new fencing tricks with
their little canes; and everywhere was comfort and enjoyment, and
everywhere peace and good-will to men. The trees were jubilant with
birds, and the paths with rollicking children. One could have a seat in
that place and plenty of music, any afternoon, for about eight cents, or
a family ticket for the season for two dollars.</p>
<p>For a change, when you wanted one, you could stroll to the Castle,
and burrow among its dungeons, or climb about its ruined towers, or
visit its interior shows–the great Heidelberg Tun, for instance.
Everybody has heard of the great Heidelberg Tun, and most people have
seen it, no doubt. It is a wine-cask as big as a cottage, and some
traditions say it holds eighteen thousand bottles, and other traditions
say it holds eighteen hundred million barrels. I think it likely that
one of these statements is a mistake, and the other is a lie. However,
the mere matter of capacity is a thing of no sort of consequence, since
the cask is empty, and indeed has always been empty, history says. An
empty cask the size of a cathedral could excite but little emotion in
me. I do not see any wisdom in building a monster cask to hoard up
emptiness in, when you can get a better quality, outside, any day, free
of expense. What could this cask have been built for? The more one
studies over that, the more uncertain and unhappy he becomes. Some
historians say that thirty couples, some say thirty thousand couples,
can dance on the head of this cask at the same time. Even this does not
seem to me to account for the building of it. It does not even throw
light on it. A profound and scholarly Englishman–a specialist–who had
made the great Heidelberg Tun his sole study for fifteen years, told me
he had at last satisfied himself that the ancients built it to make
German cream in. He said that the average German cow yielded from one to
two and half teaspoons of milk, when she was not worked in the plow or
the hay-wagon more than eighteen or nineteen hours a day. This milk was
very sweet and good, and a beautiful transparent bluish tint; but in
order to get cream from it in the most economical way, a peculiar
process was necessary. Now he believed that the habit of the ancients
was to collect several milkings in a teacup, pour it into the Great Tun,
fill up with water, and then skim off the cream from time to time as the
needs of the German Empire demanded.</p>
<p>This began to look reasonable. It certainly began to account for the
German cream which I had encountered and marveled over in so many hotels
and restaurants. But a thought struck me–</p>
<p>“Why did not each ancient dairyman take his own teacup of milk and
his own cask of water, and mix them, without making a government matter
of it?’</p>
<p>“Where could he get a cask large enough to contain the right
proportion of water?“</p>
<p>Very true. It was plain that the Englishman had studied the matter
from all sides. Still I thought I might catch him on one point; so I
asked him why the modern empire did not make the nation’s cream in the
Heidelberg Tun, instead of leaving it to rot away unused. But he
answered as one prepared–</p>
<p>“A patient and diligent examination of the modern German cream had
satisfied me that they do not use the Great Tun now, because they have
got a BIGGER one hid away somewhere. Either that is the case or they
empty the spring milkings into the mountain torrents and then skim the
Rhine all summer.“</p>
<p>There is a museum of antiquities in the Castle, and among its most
treasured relics are ancient manuscripts connected with German history.
There are hundreds of these, and their dates stretch back through many
centuries. One of them is a decree signed and sealed by the hand of a
successor of Charlemagne, in the year 896. A signature made by a hand
which vanished out of this life near a thousand years ago, is a more
impressive thing than even a ruined castle. Luther’s wedding-ring was
shown me; also a fork belonging to a time anterior to our era, and an
early bootjack. And there was a plaster cast of the head of a man who
was assassinated about sixty years ago. The stab-wounds in the face were
duplicated with unpleasant fidelity. One or two real hairs still
remained sticking in the eyebrows of the cast. That trifle seemed to
almost change the counterfeit into a corpse.</p>
<p>There are many aged portraits–some valuable, some worthless; some of
great interest, some of none at all. I bought a couple–one a gorgeous
duke of the olden time, and the other a comely blue-eyed damsel, a
princess, maybe. I bought them to start a portrait-gallery of my
ancestors with. I paid a dollar and a half for the duke and a half for
the princess. One can lay in ancestors at even cheaper rates than these,
in Europe, if he will mouse among old picture shops and look out for
chances.</p>
<p>APPENDIX C The College Prison</p>
<p>It seems that the student may break a good many of the public laws
without having to answer to the public authorities. His case must come
before the University for trial and punishment. If a policeman catches
him in an unlawful act and proceeds to arrest him, the offender
proclaims that he is a student, and perhaps shows his matriculation
card, whereupon the officer asks for his address, then goes his way, and
reports the matter at headquarters. If the offense is one over which the
city has no jurisdiction, the authorities report the case officially to
the University, and give themselves no further concern about it. The
University court send for the student, listen to the evidence, and
pronounce judgment. The punishment usually inflicted is imprisonment in
the University prison. As I understand it, a student’s case is often
tried without his being present at all. Then something like this
happens: A constable in the service of the University visits the
lodgings of the said student, knocks, is invited to come in, does so,
and says politely–</p>
<p>“If you please, I am here to conduct you to prison.“</p>
<p>“Ah,“ says the student, “I was not expecting it. What have I been
doing?“</p>
<p>“Two weeks ago the public peace had the honor to be disturbed by
you.“</p>
<p>“It is true; I had forgotten it. Very well: I have been complained
of, tried, and found guilty–is that it?“</p>
<p>“Exactly. You are sentenced to two days’ solitary confinement in the
College prison, and I am sent to fetch you.“</p>
<p>STUDENT. “O, I can’t go today.“</p>
<p>OFFICER. “If you please–why?“</p>
<p>STUDENT. “Because I’ve got an engagement.“</p>
<p>OFFICER. “Tomorrow, then, perhaps?“</p>
<p>STUDENT. “No, I am going to the opera, tomorrow.“</p>
<p>OFFICER. “Could you come Friday?“</p>
<p>STUDENT. (Reflectively.) “Let me see–Friday–Friday. I don’t seem to
have anything on hand Friday.“</p>
<p>OFFICER. “Then, if you please, I will expect you on Friday.“</p>
<p>STUDENT. “All right, I’ll come around Friday.“</p>
<p>OFFICER. “Thank you. Good day, sir.“</p>
<p>STUDENT. “Good day.“</p>
<p>So on Friday the student goes to the prison of his own accord, and is
admitted.</p>
<p>It is questionable if the world’s criminal history can show a custom
more odd than this. Nobody knows, now, how it originated. There have
always been many noblemen among the students, and it is presumed that
all students are gentlemen; in the old times it was usual to mar the
convenience of such folk as little as possible; perhaps this indulgent
custom owes its origin to this.</p>
<p>One day I was listening to some conversation upon this subject when
an American student said that for some time he had been under sentence
for a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he
would presently find an unoccupied day and betake himself to prison. I
asked the young gentleman to do me the kindness to go to jail as soon as
he conveniently could, so that I might try to get in there and visit
him, and see what college captivity was like. He said he would appoint
the very first day he could spare.</p>
<p>His confinement was to endure twenty-four hours. He shortly chose his
day, and sent me word. I started immediately. When I reached the
University Place, I saw two gentlemen talking together, and, as they had
portfolios under their arms, I judged they were tutors or elderly
students; so I asked them in English to show me the college jail. I had
learned to take it for granted that anybody in Germany who knows
anything, knows English, so I had stopped afflicting people with my
German. These gentlemen seemed a trifle amused–and a trifle confused,
too–but one of them said he would walk around the corner with me and
show me the place. He asked me why I wanted to get in there, and I said
to see a friend–and for curiosity. He doubted if I would be admitted,
but volunteered to put in a word or two for me with the custodian.</p>
<p>He rang the bell, a door opened, and we stepped into a paved way and
then up into a small living-room, where we were received by a hearty and
good-natured German woman of fifty. She threw up her hands with a
surprised “ACH GOTT, HERR PROFESSOR!“ and exhibited a mighty deference
for my new acquaintance. By the sparkle in her eye I judged she was a
good deal amused, too. The “Herr Professor“ talked to her in German, and
I understood enough of it to know that he was bringing very plausible
reasons to bear for admitting me. They were successful. So the Herr
Professor received my earnest thanks and departed. The old dame got her
keys, took me up two or three flights of stairs, unlocked a door, and we
stood in the presence of the criminal. Then she went into a jolly and
eager description of all that had occurred downstairs, and what the Herr
Professor had said, and so forth and so on. Plainly, she regarded it as
quite a superior joke that I had waylaid a Professor and employed him in
so odd a service. But I wouldn’t have done it if I had known he was a
Professor; therefore my conscience was not disturbed.</p>
<p>Now the dame left us to ourselves. The cell was not a roomy one;
still it was a little larger than an ordinary prison cell. It had a
window of good size, iron-grated; a small stove; two wooden chairs; two
oaken tables, very old and most elaborately carved with names, mottoes,
faces, armorial bearings, etc.–the work of several generations of
imprisoned students; and a narrow wooden bedstead with a villainous
straw mattress, but no sheets, pillows, blankets, or coverlets–for these
the student must furnish at his own cost if he wants them. There was no
carpet, of course.</p>
<p>The ceiling was completely covered with names, dates, and monograms,
done with candle-smoke. The walls were thickly covered with pictures and
portraits (in profile), some done with ink, some with soot, some with a
pencil, and some with red, blue, and green chalks; and whenever an inch
or two of space had remained between the pictures, the captives had
written plaintive verses, or names and dates. I do not think I was ever
in a more elaborately frescoed apartment.</p>
<p>Against the wall hung a placard containing the prison laws. I made a
note of one or two of these. For instance: The prisoner must pay, for
the “privilege“ of entering, a sum equivalent to 20 cents of our money;
for the privilege of leaving, when his term had expired, 20 cents; for
every day spent in the prison, 12 cents; for fire and light, 12 cents a
day. The jailer furnishes coffee, mornings, for a small sum; dinners and
suppers may be ordered from outside if the prisoner chooses–and he is
allowed to pay for them, too.</p>
<p>Here and there, on the walls, appeared the names of American
students, and in one place the American arms and motto were displayed in
colored chalks.</p>
<p>With the help of my friend I translated many of the inscriptions.</p>
<p>Some of them were cheerful, others the reverse. I will give the
reader a few specimens:</p>
<p>“In my tenth semester (my best one), I am cast here through the
complaints of others. Let those who follow me take warning.“</p>
<p>“III TAGE OHNE GRUND ANGEBLICH AUS NEUGIERDE.“ Which is to say, he
had a curiosity to know what prison life was like; so he made a breach
in some law and got three days for it. It is more than likely that he
never had the same curiosity again.</p>
<p>(TRANSLATION.) “E. Glinicke, four days for being too eager a
spectator of a row.“</p>
<p>“F. Graf Bismarck–27-29, II, ’74.“ Which means that Count Bismarck,
son of the great statesman, was a prisoner two days in 1874.</p>
<p>(TRANSLATION.) “R. Diergandt–for Love–4 days.“ Many people in this
world have caught it heavier than for the same indiscretion.</p>
<p>This one is terse. I translate:</p>
<p>“Four weeks for MISINTERPRETED GALLANTRY.“ I wish the sufferer had
explained a little more fully. A four-week term is a rather serious
matter.</p>
<p>There were many uncomplimentary references, on the walls, to a
certain unpopular dignitary. One sufferer had got three days for not
saluting him. Another had “here two days slept and three nights lain
awake,“ on account of this same “Dr. K.“ In one place was a picture of
Dr. K. hanging on a gallows.</p>
<p>Here and there, lonesome prisoners had eased the heavy time by
altering the records left by predecessors. Leaving the name standing,
and the date and length of the captivity, they had erased the
description of the misdemeanor, and written in its place, in staring
capitals, “FOR THEFT!“ or “FOR MURDER!“ or some other gaudy crime. In
one place, all by itself, stood this blood-curdling word:</p>
<p>“Rache!“ [1]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Revenge!“</li>
</ol>
<p>There was no name signed, and no date. It was an inscription well
calculated to pique curiosity. One would greatly like to know the nature
of the wrong that had been done, and what sort of vengeance was wanted,
and whether the prisoner ever achieved it or not. But there was no way
of finding out these things.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a name was followed simply by the remark, “II days, for
disturbing the peace,“ and without comment upon the justice or injustice
of the sentence.</p>
<p>In one place was a hilarious picture of a student of the green cap
corps with a bottle of champagne in each hand; and below was the legend:
“These make an evil fate endurable.“</p>
<p>There were two prison cells, and neither had space left on walls or
ceiling for another name or portrait or picture. The inside surfaces of
the two doors were completely covered with CARTES DE VISITE of former
prisoners, ingeniously let into the wood and protected from dirt and
injury by glass.</p>
<p>I very much wanted one of the sorry old tables which the prisoners
had spent so many years in ornamenting with their pocket-knives, but red
tape was in the way. The custodian could not sell one without an order
from a superior; and that superior would have to get it from HIS
superior; and this one would have to get it from a higher one–and so on
up and up until the faculty should sit on the matter and deliver final
judgment. The system was right, and nobody could find fault with it; but
it did not seem justifiable to bother so many people, so I proceeded no
further. It might have cost me more than I could afford, anyway; for one
of those prison tables, which was at the time in a private museum in
Heidelberg, was afterward sold at auction for two hundred and fifty
dollars. It was not worth more than a dollar, or possibly a dollar and
half, before the captive students began their work on it. Persons who
saw it at the auction said it was so curiously and wonderfully carved
that it was worth the money that was paid for it.</p>
<p>Among them many who have tasted the college prison’s dreary
hospitality was a lively young fellow from one of the Southern states of
America, whose first year’s experience of German university life was
rather peculiar. The day he arrived in Heidelberg he enrolled his name
on the college books, and was so elated with the fact that his dearest
hope had found fruition and he was actually a student of the old and
renowned university, that he set to work that very night to celebrate
the event by a grand lark in company with some other students. In the
course of his lark he managed to make a wide breach in one of the
university’s most stringent laws. Sequel: before noon, next day, he was
in the college prison–booked for three months. The twelve long weeks
dragged slowly by, and the day of deliverance came at last. A great
crowd of sympathizing fellow-students received him with a rousing
demonstration as he came forth, and of course there was another grand
lark–in the course of which he managed to make a wide breach of the
CITY’S most stringent laws. Sequel: before noon, next day, he was safe
in the city lockup–booked for three months. This second tedious
captivity drew to an end in the course of time, and again a great crowd
of sympathizing fellow students gave him a rousing reception as he came
forth; but his delight in his freedom was so boundless that he could not
proceed soberly and calmly, but must go hopping and skipping and jumping
down the sleety street from sheer excess of joy. Sequel: he slipped and
broke his leg, and actually lay in the hospital during the next three
months!</p>
<p>When he at last became a free man again, he said he believed he would
hunt up a brisker seat of learning; the Heidelberg lectures might be
good, but the opportunities of attending them were too rare, the
educational process too slow; he said he had come to Europe with the
idea that the acquirement of an education was only a matter of time, but
if he had averaged the Heidelberg system correctly, it was rather a
matter of eternity.</p>
<p>APPENDIX D The Awful German Language</p>
<p>A little learning makes the whole world kin. –Proverbs xxxii, 7.</p>
<p>I went often to look at the collection of curiosities in Heidelberg
Castle, and one day I surprised the keeper of it with my German. I spoke
entirely in that language. He was greatly interested; and after I had
talked a while he said my German was very rare, possibly a “unique“; and
wanted to add it to his museum.</p>
<p>If he had known what it had cost me to acquire my art, he would also
have known that it would break any collector to buy it. Harris and I had
been hard at work on our German during several weeks at that time, and
although we had made good progress, it had been accomplished under great
difficulty and annoyance, for three of our teachers had died in the mean
time. A person who has not studied German can form no idea of what a
perplexing language it is.</p>
<p>Surely there is not another language that is so slipshod and
systemless, and so slippery and elusive to the grasp. One is washed
about in it, hither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at
last he thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a
rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech, he
turns over the page and reads, “Let the pupil make careful note of the
following EXCEPTIONS.“ He runs his eye down and finds that there are
more exceptions to the rule than instances of it. So overboard he goes
again, to hunt for another Ararat and find another quicksand. Such has
been, and continues to be, my experience. Every time I think I have got
one of these four confusing “cases“ where I am master of it, a seemingly
insignificant preposition intrudes itself into my sentence, clothed with
an awful and unsuspected power, and crumbles the ground from under me.
For instance, my book inquires after a certain bird–(it is always
inquiring after things which are of no sort of no consequence to
anybody): “Where is the bird?“ Now the answer to this question–according
to the book–is that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on
account of the rain. Of course no bird would do that, but then you must
stick to the book. Very well, I begin to cipher out the German for that
answer. I begin at the wrong end, necessarily, for that is the German
idea. I say to myself, “REGEN (rain) is masculine–or maybe it is
feminine–or possibly neuter–it is too much trouble to look now.
Therefore, it is either DER (the) Regen, or DIE (the) Regen, or DAS
(the) Regen, according to which gender it may turn out to be when I
look. In the interest of science, I will cipher it out on the hypothesis
that it is masculine. Very well–then THE rain is DER Regen, if it is
simply in the quiescent state of being MENTIONED, without enlargement or
discussion–Nominative case; but if this rain is lying around, in a kind
of a general way on the ground, it is then definitely located, it is
DOING SOMETHING–that is, RESTING (which is one of the German grammar’s
ideas of doing something), and this throws the rain into the Dative
case, and makes it DEM Regen. However, this rain is not resting, but is
doing something ACTIVELY,–it is falling–to interfere with the bird,
likely–and this indicates MOVEMENT, which has the effect of sliding it
into the Accusative case and changing DEM Regen into DEN Regen.“ Having
completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter, I answer up
confidently and state in German that the bird is staying in the
blacksmith shop “wegen (on account of) DEN Regen.“ Then the teacher lets
me softly down with the remark that whenever the word “wegen“ drops into
a sentence, it ALWAYS throws that subject into the GENITIVE case,
regardless of consequences–and therefore this bird stayed in the
blacksmith shop “wegen DES Regens.“</p>
<p>N.B.–I was informed, later, by a higher authority, that there was an
“exception“ which permits one to say “wegen DEN Regen“ in certain
peculiar and complex circumstances, but that this exception is not
extended to anything BUT rain.</p>
<p>There are ten parts of speech, and they are all troublesome. An
average sentence, in a German newspaper, is a sublime and impressive
curiosity; it occupies a quarter of a column; it contains all the ten
parts of speech–not in regular order, but mixed; it is built mainly of
compound words constructed by the writer on the spot, and not to be
found in any dictionary–six or seven words compacted into one, without
joint or seam–that is, without hyphens; it treats of fourteen or fifteen
different subjects, each enclosed in a parenthesis of its own, with here
and there extra parentheses, making pens with pens: finally, all the
parentheses and reparentheses are massed together between a couple of
king-parentheses, one of which is placed in the first line of the
majestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of
it–AFTER WHICH COMES THE VERB, and you find out for the first time what
the man has been talking about; and after the verb–merely by way of
ornament, as far as I can make out–the writer shovels in “HABEN SIND
GEWESEN GEHABT HAVEN GEWORDEN SEIN,“ or words to that effect, and the
monument is finished. I suppose that this closing hurrah is in the
nature of the flourish to a man’s signature–not necessary, but pretty.
German books are easy enough to read when you hold them before the
looking-glass or stand on your head–so as to reverse the
construction–but I think that to learn to read and understand a German
newspaper is a thing which must always remain an impossibility to a
foreigner.</p>
<p>Yet even the German books are not entirely free from attacks of the
Parenthesis distemper–though they are usually so mild as to cover only a
few lines, and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it
carries some meaning to your mind because you are able to remember a
good deal of what has gone before. Now here is a sentence from a popular
and excellent German novel–which a slight parenthesis in it. I will make
a perfectly literal translation, and throw in the parenthesis-marks and
some hyphens for the assistance of the reader–though in the original
there are no parenthesis-marks or hyphens, and the reader is left to
flounder through to the remote verb the best way he can:</p>
<p>“But when he, upon the street, the (in-satin-and-silk-covered-
now-very-unconstrained-after-the-newest-fashioned-dressed) government
counselor’s wife MET,“ etc., etc. [1]</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Wenn er aber auf der Strasse der in Sammt und Seide gehuellten jetz
sehr ungenirt nach der neusten mode gekleideten Regierungsrathin
begegnet.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is from THE OLD MAMSELLE’S SECRET, by Mrs. Marlitt. And that
sentence is constructed upon the most approved German model. You observe
how far that verb is from the reader’s base of operations; well, in a
German newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page; and I
have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting
preliminaries and parentheses for a column or two, they get in a hurry
and have to go to press without getting to the verb at all. Of course,
then, the reader is left in a very exhausted and ignorant state.</p>
<p>We have the Parenthesis disease in our literature, too; and one may
see cases of it every day in our books and newspapers: but with us it is
the mark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect,
whereas with the Germans it is doubtless the mark and sign of a
practiced pen and of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual
fog which stands for clearness among these people. For surely it is NOT
clearness–it necessarily can’t be clearness. Even a jury would have
penetration enough to discover that. A writer’s ideas must be a good
deal confused, a good deal out of line and sequence, when he starts out
to say that a man met a counselor’s wife in the street, and then right
in the midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching
people and makes them stand still until he jots down an inventory of the
woman’s dress. That is manifestly absurd. It reminds a person of those
dentists who secure your instant and breathless interest in a tooth by
taking a grip on it with the forceps, and then stand there and drawl
through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreaded jerk.
Parentheses in literature and dentistry are in bad taste.</p>
<p>The Germans have another kind of parenthesis, which they make by
splitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an
exciting chapter and the OTHER HALF at the end of it. Can any one
conceive of anything more confusing than that? These things are called
“separable verbs.“ The German grammar is blistered all over with
separable verbs; and the wider the two portions of one of them are
spread apart, the better the author of the crime is pleased with his
performance. A favorite one is REISTE AB–which means departed. Here is
an example which I culled from a novel and reduced to English:</p>
<p>“The trunks being now ready, he DE- after kissing his mother and
sisters, and once more pressing to his bosom his adored Gretchen, who,
dressed in simple white muslin, with a single tuberose in the ample
folds of her rich brown hair, had tottered feebly down the stairs, still
pale from the terror and excitement of the past evening, but longing to
lay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she
loved more dearly than life itself, PARTED.“</p>
<p>However, it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs. One
is sure to lose his temper early; and if he sticks to the subject, and
will not be warned, it will at last either soften his brain or petrify
it. Personal pronouns and adjectives are a fruitful nuisance in this
language, and should have been left out. For instance, the same sound,
SIE, means YOU, and it means SHE, and it means HER, and it means IT, and
it means THEY, and it means THEM. Think of the ragged poverty of a
language which has to make one word do the work of six–and a poor little
weak thing of only three letters at that. But mainly, think of the
exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is
trying to convey. This explains why, whenever a person says SIE to me, I
generally try to kill him, if a stranger.</p>
<p>Now observe the Adjective. Here was a case where simplicity would
have been an advantage; therefore, for no other reason, the inventor of
this language complicated it all he could. When we wish to speak of our
“good friend or friends,“ in our enlightened tongue, we stick to the one
form and have no trouble or hard feeling about it; but with the German
tongue it is different. When a German gets his hands on an adjective, he
declines it, and keeps on declining it until the common sense is all
declined out of it. It is as bad as Latin. He says, for instance:</p>
<p>SINGULAR</p>
<p>Nominative–Mein gutER Freund, my good friend. Genitives–MeinES GutEN
FreundES, of my good friend. Dative–MeinEM gutEN Freund, to my good
friend. Accusative–MeinEN gutEN Freund, my good friend.</p>
<p>PLURAL</p>
<p>N.–MeinE gutEN FreundE, my good friends. G.–MeinER gutEN FreundE, of
my good friends. D.–MeinEN gutEN FreundEN, to my good friends. A.–MeinE
gutEN FreundE, my good friends.</p>
<p>Now let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize those
variations, and see how soon he will be elected. One might better go
without friends in Germany than take all this trouble about them. I have
shown what a bother it is to decline a good (male) friend; well this is
only a third of the work, for there is a variety of new distortions of
the adjective to be learned when the object is feminine, and still
another when the object is neuter. Now there are more adjectives in this
language than there are black cats in Switzerland, and they must all be
as elaborately declined as the examples above suggested.
Difficult?–troublesome?–these words cannot describe it. I heard a
Californian student in Heidelberg say, in one of his calmest moods, that
he would rather decline two drinks than one German adjective.</p>
<p>The inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in
complicating it in every way he could think of. For instance, if one is
casually referring to a house, HAUS, or a horse, PFERD, or a dog, HUND,
he spells these words as I have indicated; but if he is referring to
them in the Dative case, he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary E and
spells them HAUSE, PFERDE, HUNDE. So, as an added E often signifies the
plural, as the S does with us, the new student is likely to go on for a
month making twins out of a Dative dog before he discovers his mistake;
and on the other hand, many a new student who could ill afford loss, has
bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them, because he
ignorantly bought that dog in the Dative singular when he really
supposed he was talking plural–which left the law on the seller’s side,
of course, by the strict rules of grammar, and therefore a suit for
recovery could not lie.</p>
<p>In German, all the Nouns begin with a capital letter. Now that is a
good idea; and a good idea, in this language, is necessarily conspicuous
from its lonesomeness. I consider this capitalizing of nouns a good
idea, because by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun
the minute you see it. You fall into error occasionally, because you
mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing, and waste a good
deal of time trying to dig a meaning out of it. German names almost
always do mean something, and this helps to deceive the student. I
translated a passage one day, which said that “the infuriated tigress
broke loose and utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest“ (Tannenwald).
When I was girding up my loins to doubt this, I found out that
Tannenwald in this instance was a man’s name.</p>
<p>Every noun has a gender, and there is no sense or system in the
distribution; so the gender of each must be learned separately and by
heart. There is no other way. To do this one has to have a memory like a
memorandum-book. In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has.
Think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip, and what
callous disrespect for the girl. See how it looks in print–I translate
this from a conversation in one of the best of the German Sunday-school
books:</p>
<p>“Gretchen. Wilhelm, where is the turnip?</p>
<p>“Wilhelm. She has gone to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Gretchen. Where is the accomplished and beautiful English
maiden?</p>
<p>“Wilhelm. It has gone to the opera.“</p>
<p>To continue with the German genders: a tree is male, its buds are
female, its leaves are neuter; horses are sexless, dogs are male, cats
are female–tomcats included, of course; a person’s mouth, neck, bosom,
elbows, fingers, nails, feet, and body are of the male sex, and his head
is male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it, and NOT
according to the sex of the individual who wears it–for in Germany all
the women either male heads or sexless ones; a person’s nose, lips,
shoulders, breast, hands, and toes are of the female sex; and his hair,
ears, eyes, chin, legs, knees, heart, and conscience haven’t any sex at
all. The inventor of the language probably got what he knew about a
conscience from hearsay.</p>
<p>Now, by the above dissection, the reader will see that in Germany a
man may THINK he is a man, but when he comes to look into the matter
closely, he is bound to have his doubts; he finds that in sober truth he
is a most ridiculous mixture; and if he ends by trying to comfort
himself with the thought that he can at least depend on a third of this
mess as being manly and masculine, the humiliating second thought will
quickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any
woman or cow in the land.</p>
<p>In the German it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of
the language, a Woman is a female; but a Wife (Weib) is not–which is
unfortunate. A Wife, here, has no sex; she is neuter; so, according to
the grammar, a fish is HE, his scales are SHE, but a fishwife is
neither. To describe a wife as sexless may be called under-description;
that is bad enough, but over-description is surely worse. A German
speaks of an Englishman as the ENGLAENDER; to change the sex, he adds
INN, and that stands for Englishwoman –ENGLAENDERINN. That seems
descriptive enough, but still it is not exact enough for a German; so he
precedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to
follow is feminine, and writes it down thus: “die Englaenderinn,“–which
means “the she-Englishwoman.“ I consider that that person is
over-described.</p>
<p>Well, after the student has learned the sex of a great number of
nouns, he is still in a difficulty, because he finds it impossible to
persuade his tongue to refer to things as “he“ and “she,“ and “him“ and
“her,“ which it has been always accustomed to refer to it as “it.“ When
he even frames a German sentence in his mind, with the hims and hers in
the right places, and then works up his courage to the utterance-point,
it is no use –the moment he begins to speak his tongue files the track
and all those labored males and females come out as “its.“ And even when
he is reading German to himself, he always calls those things “it,“
where as he ought to read in this way:</p>
<p>TALE OF THE FISHWIFE AND ITS SAD FATE [2]</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>I capitalize the nouns, in the German (and ancient English)
fashion.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is a bleak Day. Hear the Rain, how he pours, and the Hail, how he
rattles; and see the Snow, how he drifts along, and of the Mud, how deep
he is! Ah the poor Fishwife, it is stuck fast in the Mire; it has
dropped its Basket of Fishes; and its Hands have been cut by the Scales
as it seized some of the falling Creatures; and one Scale has even got
into its Eye. and it cannot get her out. It opens its Mouth to cry for
Help; but if any Sound comes out of him, alas he is drowned by the
raging of the Storm. And now a Tomcat has got one of the Fishes and she
will surely escape with him. No, she bites off a Fin, she holds her in
her Mouth–will she swallow her? No, the Fishwife’s brave Mother-dog
deserts his Puppies and rescues the Fin–which he eats, himself, as his
Reward. O, horror, the Lightning has struck the Fish-basket; he sets him
on Fire; see the Flame, how she licks the doomed Utensil with her red
and angry Tongue; now she attacks the helpless Fishwife’s Foot–she burns
him up, all but the big Toe, and even SHE is partly consumed; and still
she spreads, still she waves her fiery Tongues; she attacks the
Fishwife’s Leg and destroys IT; she attacks its Hand and destroys HER
also; she attacks the Fishwife’s Leg and destroys HER also; she attacks
its Body and consumes HIM; she wreathes herself about its Heart and IT
is consumed; next about its Breast, and in a Moment SHE is a Cinder; now
she reaches its Neck–He goes; now its Chin –IT goes; now its Nose–SHE
goes. In another Moment, except Help come, the Fishwife will be no more.
Time presses–is there none to succor and save? Yes! Joy, joy, with
flying Feet the she-Englishwoman comes! But alas, the generous
she-Female is too late: where now is the fated Fishwife? It has ceased
from its Sufferings, it has gone to a better Land; all that is left of
it for its loved Ones to lament over, is this poor smoldering Ash-heap.
Ah, woeful, woeful Ash-heap! Let us take him up tenderly, reverently,
upon the lowly Shovel, and bear him to his long Rest, with the Prayer
that when he rises again it will be a Realm where he will have one good
square responsible Sex, and have it all to himself, instead of having a
mangy lot of assorted Sexes scattered all over him in Spots.</p>
<hr />
<p>There, now, the reader can see for himself that this pronoun business
is a very awkward thing for the unaccustomed tongue. I suppose that in
all languages the similarities of look and sound between words which
have no similarity in meaning are a fruitful source of perplexity to the
foreigner. It is so in our tongue, and it is notably the case in the
German. Now there is that troublesome word VERMAEHLT: to me it has so
close a resemblance–either real or fancied–to three or four other words,
that I never know whether it means despised, painted, suspected, or
married; until I look in the dictionary, and then I find it means the
latter. There are lots of such words and they are a great torment. To
increase the difficulty there are words which SEEM to resemble each
other, and yet do not; but they make just as much trouble as if they
did. For instance, there is the word VERMIETHEN (to let, to lease, to
hire); and the word VERHEIRATHEN (another way of saying to marry). I
heard of an Englishman who knocked at a man’s door in Heidelberg and
proposed, in the best German he could command, to “verheirathen“ that
house. Then there are some words which mean one thing when you emphasize
the first syllable, but mean something very different if you throw the
emphasis on the last syllable. For instance, there is a word which means
a runaway, or the act of glancing through a book, according to the
placing of the emphasis; and another word which signifies to ASSOCIATE
with a man, or to AVOID him, according to where you put the emphasis–and
you can generally depend on putting it in the wrong place and getting
into trouble.</p>
<p>There are some exceedingly useful words in this language. SCHLAG, for
example; and ZUG. There are three-quarters of a column of SCHLAGS in the
dictionary, and a column and a half of ZUGS. The word SCHLAG means Blow,
Stroke, Dash, Hit, Shock, Clap, Slap, Time, Bar, Coin, Stamp, Kind,
Sort, Manner, Way, Apoplexy, Wood-cutting, Enclosure, Field,
Forest-clearing. This is its simple and EXACT meaning–that is to say,
its restricted, its fettered meaning; but there are ways by which you
can set it free, so that it can soar away, as on the wings of the
morning, and never be at rest. You can hang any word you please to its
tail, and make it mean anything you want to. You can begin with
SCHLAG-ADER, which means artery, and you can hang on the whole
dictionary, word by word, clear through the alphabet to SCHLAG-WASSER,
which means bilge-water–and including SCHLAG-MUTTER, which means
mother-in-law.</p>
<p>Just the same with ZUG. Strictly speaking, ZUG means Pull, Tug,
Draught, Procession, March, Progress, Flight, Direction, Expedition,
Train, Caravan, Passage, Stroke, Touch, Line, Flourish, Trait of
Character, Feature, Lineament, Chess-move, Organ-stop, Team, Whiff,
Bias, Drawer, Propensity, Inhalation, Disposition: but that thing which
it does NOT mean–when all its legitimate pennants have been hung on, has
not been discovered yet.</p>
<p>One cannot overestimate the usefulness of SCHLAG and ZUG. Armed just
with these two, and the word ALSO, what cannot the foreigner on German
soil accomplish? The German word ALSO is the equivalent of the English
phrase “You know,“ and does not mean anything at all–in TALK, though it
sometimes does in print. Every time a German opens his mouth an ALSO
falls out; and every time he shuts it he bites one in two that was
trying to GET out.</p>
<p>Now, the foreigner, equipped with these three noble words, is master
of the situation. Let him talk right along, fearlessly; let him pour his
indifferent German forth, and when he lacks for a word, let him heave a
SCHLAG into the vacuum; all the chances are that it fits it like a plug,
but if it doesn’t let him promptly heave a ZUG after it; the two
together can hardly fail to bung the hole; but if, by a miracle, they
SHOULD fail, let him simply say ALSO! and this will give him a moment’s
chance to think of the needful word. In Germany, when you load your
conversational gun it is always best to throw in a SCHLAG or two and a
ZUG or two, because it doesn’t make any difference how much the rest of
the charge may scatter, you are bound to bag something with THEM. Then
you blandly say ALSO, and load up again. Nothing gives such an air of
grace and elegance and unconstraint to a German or an English
conversation as to scatter it full of “Also’s“ or “You knows.“</p>
<p>In my note-book I find this entry:</p>
<p>July 1.–In the hospital yesterday, a word of thirteen syllables was
successfully removed from a patient–a North German from near Hamburg;
but as most unfortunately the surgeons had opened him in the wrong
place, under the impression that he contained a panorama, he died. The
sad event has cast a gloom over the whole community.</p>
<p>That paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about one of the
most curious and notable features of my subject–the length of German
words. Some German words are so long that they have a perspective.
Observe these examples:</p>
<p>Freundschaftsbezeigungen.</p>
<p>Dilettantenaufdringlichkeiten.</p>
<p>Stadtverordnetenversammlungen.</p>
<p>These things are not words, they are alphabetical processions. And
they are not rare; one can open a German newspaper at any time and see
them marching majestically across the page–and if he has any imagination
he can see the banners and hear the music, too. They impart a martial
thrill to the meekest subject. I take a great interest in these
curiosities. Whenever I come across a good one, I stuff it and put it in
my museum. In this way I have made quite a valuable collection. When I
get duplicates, I exchange with other collectors, and thus increase the
variety of my stock. Here rare some specimens which I lately bought at
an auction sale of the effects of a bankrupt bric-a-brac hunter:</p>
<p>Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen.</p>
<p>Alterthumswissenschaften.</p>
<p>Kinderbewahrungsanstalten.</p>
<p>Unabhaengigkeitserklaerungen.</p>
<p>Wiedererstellungbestrebungen.</p>
<p>Waffenstillstandsunterhandlungen.</p>
<p>Of course when one of these grand mountain ranges goes stretching
across the printed page, it adorns and ennobles that literary
landscape–but at the same time it is a great distress to the new
student, for it blocks up his way; he cannot crawl under it, or climb
over it, or tunnel through it. So he resorts to the dictionary for help,
but there is no help there. The dictionary must draw the line
somewhere–so it leaves this sort of words out. And it is right, because
these long things are hardly legitimate words, but are rather
combinations of words, and the inventor of them ought to have been
killed. They are compound words with the hyphens left out. The various
words used in building them are in the dictionary, but in a very
scattered condition; so you can hunt the materials out, one by one, and
get at the meaning at last, but it is a tedious and harassing business.
I have tried this process upon some of the above examples.
“Freundshaftsbezeigungen“ seems to be “Friendship demonstrations,“ which
is only a foolish and clumsy way of saying “demonstrations of
friendship.“ “Unabhaengigkeitserklaerungen“ seems to be
“Independencedeclarations,“ which is no improvement upon “Declarations
of Independence,“ so far as I can see.
“Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen“ seems to be
“General-statesrepresentativesmeetings,“ as nearly as I can get at it–a
mere rhythmical, gushy euphemism for “meetings of the legislature,“ I
judge. We used to have a good deal of this sort of crime in our
literature, but it has gone out now. We used to speak of a things as a
“never-to-be-forgotten“ circumstance, instead of cramping it into the
simple and sufficient word “memorable“ and then going calmly about our
business as if nothing had happened. In those days we were not content
to embalm the thing and bury it decently, we wanted to build a monument
over it.</p>
<p>But in our newspapers the compounding-disease lingers a little to the
present day, but with the hyphens left out, in the German fashion. This
is the shape it takes: instead of saying “Mr. Simmons, clerk of the
county and district courts, was in town yesterday,“ the new form put it
thus: “Clerk of the County and District Courts Simmons was in town
yesterday.“ This saves neither time nor ink, and has an awkward sound
besides. One often sees a remark like this in our papers: “MRS.
Assistant District Attorney Johnson returned to her city residence
yesterday for the season.“ That is a case of really unjustifiable
compounding; because it not only saves no time or trouble, but confers a
title on Mrs. Johnson which she has no right to. But these little
instances are trifles indeed, contrasted with the ponderous and dismal
German system of piling jumbled compounds together. I wish to submit the
following local item, from a Mannheim journal, by way of
illustration:</p>
<p>“In the daybeforeyesterdayshortlyaftereleveno’clock Night, the
inthistownstandingtavern called ‘The Wagoner’ was downburnt. When the
fire to the onthedownburninghouseresting Stork’s Nest reached, flew the
parent Storks away. But when the bytheraging, firesurrounded Nest ITSELF
caught Fire, straightway plunged the quickreturning Mother-Stork into
the Flames and died, her Wings over her young ones outspread.“</p>
<p>Even the cumbersome German construction is not able to take the
pathos out of that picture–indeed, it somehow seems to strengthen it.
This item is dated away back yonder months ago. I could have used it
sooner, but I was waiting to hear from the Father-stork. I am still
waiting.</p>
<p>“ALSO!“ If I had not shown that the German is a difficult language, I
have at least intended to do so. I have heard of an American student who
was asked how he was getting along with his German, and who answered
promptly: “I am not getting along at all. I have worked at it hard for
three level months, and all I have got to show for it is one solitary
German phrase–‘ZWEI GLAS’“ (two glasses of beer). He paused for a
moment, reflectively; then added with feeling: “But I’ve got that
SOLID!“</p>
<p>And if I have not also shown that German is a harassing and
infuriating study, my execution has been at fault, and not my intent. I
heard lately of a worn and sorely tried American student who used to fly
to a certain German word for relief when he could bear up under his
aggravations no longer–the only word whose sound was sweet and precious
to his ear and healing to his lacerated spirit. This was the word DAMIT.
It was only the SOUND that helped him, not the meaning; [3] and so, at
last, when he learned that the emphasis was not on the first syllable,
his only stay and support was gone, and he faded away and died.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>It merely means, in its general sense, “herewith.“</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that a description of any loud, stirring, tumultuous episode
must be tamer in German than in English. Our descriptive words of this
character have such a deep, strong, resonant sound, while their German
equivalents do seem so thin and mild and energyless. Boom, burst, crash,
roar, storm, bellow, blow, thunder, explosion; howl, cry, shout, yell,
groan; battle, hell. These are magnificent words; the have a force and
magnitude of sound befitting the things which they describe. But their
German equivalents would be ever so nice to sing the children to sleep
with, or else my awe-inspiring ears were made for display and not for
superior usefulness in analyzing sounds. Would any man want to die in a
battle which was called by so tame a term as a SCHLACHT? Or would not a
consumptive feel too much bundled up, who was about to go out, in a
shirt-collar and a seal-ring, into a storm which the bird-song word
GEWITTER was employed to describe? And observe the strongest of the
several German equivalents for explosion–AUSBRUCH. Our word Toothbrush
is more powerful than that. It seems to me that the Germans could do
worse than import it into their language to describe particularly
tremendous explosions with. The German word for hell–Hoelle–sounds more
like HELLY than anything else; therefore, how necessary chipper,
frivolous, and unimpressive it is. If a man were told in German to go
there, could he really rise to thee dignity of feeling insulted?</p>
<p>Having pointed out, in detail, the several vices of this language, I
now come to the brief and pleasant task of pointing out its virtues. The
capitalizing of the nouns I have already mentioned. But far before this
virtue stands another–that of spelling a word according to the sound of
it. After one short lesson in the alphabet, the student can tell how any
German word is pronounced without having to ask; whereas in our language
if a student should inquire of us, “What does B, O, W, spell?“ we should
be obliged to reply, “Nobody can tell what it spells when you set if off
by itself; you can only tell by referring to the context and finding out
what it signifies–whether it is a thing to shoot arrows with, or a nod
of one’s head, or the forward end of a boat.“</p>
<p>There are some German words which are singularly and powerfully
effective. For instance, those which describe lowly, peaceful, and
affectionate home life; those which deal with love, in any and all
forms, from mere kindly feeling and honest good will toward the passing
stranger, clear up to courtship; those which deal with outdoor Nature,
in its softest and loveliest aspects–with meadows and forests, and birds
and flowers, the fragrance and sunshine of summer, and the moonlight of
peaceful winter nights; in a word, those which deal with any and all
forms of rest, repose, and peace; those also which deal with the
creatures and marvels of fairyland; and lastly and chiefly, in those
words which express pathos, is the language surpassingly rich and
affective. There are German songs which can make a stranger to the
language cry. That shows that the SOUND of the words is correct–it
interprets the meanings with truth and with exactness; and so the ear is
informed, and through the ear, the heart.</p>
<p>The Germans do not seem to be afraid to repeat a word when it is the
right one. They repeat it several times, if they choose. That is wise.
But in English, when we have used a word a couple of times in a
paragraph, we imagine we are growing tautological, and so we are weak
enough to exchange it for some other word which only approximates
exactness, to escape what we wrongly fancy is a greater blemish.
Repetition may be bad, but surely inexactness is worse.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are people in the world who will take a great deal of trouble
to point out the faults in a religion or a language, and then go blandly
about their business without suggesting any remedy. I am not that kind
of person. I have shown that the German language needs reforming. Very
well, I am ready to reform it. At least I am ready to make the proper
suggestions. Such a course as this might be immodest in another; but I
have devoted upward of nine full weeks, first and last, to a careful and
critical study of this tongue, and thus have acquired a confidence in my
ability to reform it which no mere superficial culture could have
conferred upon me.</p>
<p>In the first place, I would leave out the Dative case. It confuses
the plurals; and, besides, nobody ever knows when he is in the Dative
case, except he discover it by accident–and then he does not know when
or where it was that he got into it, or how long he has been in it, or
how he is going to get out of it again. The Dative case is but an
ornamental folly–it is better to discard it.</p>
<p>In the next place, I would move the Verb further up to the front. You
may load up with ever so good a Verb, but I notice that you never really
bring down a subject with it at the present German range–you only
cripple it. So I insist that this important part of speech should be
brought forward to a position where it may be easily seen with the naked
eye.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I would import some strong words from the English tongue–to
swear with, and also to use in describing all sorts of vigorous things
in a vigorous ways. [4]</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>“Verdammt,“ and its variations and enlargements, are words which
have plenty of meaning, but the SOUNDS are so mild and ineffectual that
German ladies can use them without sin. German ladies who could not be
induced to commit a sin by any persuasion or compulsion, promptly rip
out one of these harmless little words when they tear their dresses or
don’t like the soup. It sounds about as wicked as our “My gracious.“
German ladies are constantly saying, “Ach! Gott!“ “Mein Gott!“ “Gott in
Himmel!“ “Herr Gott“ “Der Herr Jesus!“ etc. They think our ladies have
the same custom, perhaps; for I once heard a gentle and lovely old
German lady say to a sweet young American girl: “The two languages are
so alike–how pleasant that is; we say ‘Ach! Gott!’ you say
‘Goddamn.’“</li>
</ol>
<p>Fourthly, I would reorganizes the sexes, and distribute them
accordingly to the will of the creator. This as a tribute of respect, if
nothing else.</p>
<p>Fifthly, I would do away with those great long compounded words; or
require the speaker to deliver them in sections, with intermissions for
refreshments. To wholly do away with them would be best, for ideas are
more easily received and digested when they come one at a time than when
they come in bulk. Intellectual food is like any other; it is pleasanter
and more beneficial to take it with a spoon than with a shovel.</p>
<p>Sixthly, I would require a speaker to stop when he is done, and not
hang a string of those useless “haven sind gewesen gehabt haben geworden
seins“ to the end of his oration. This sort of gewgaws undignify a
speech, instead of adding a grace. They are, therefore, an offense, and
should be discarded.</p>
<p>Seventhly, I would discard the Parenthesis. Also the reparenthesis,
the re-reparenthesis, and the re-re-re-re-re-reparentheses, and likewise
the final wide-reaching all-enclosing king-parenthesis. I would require
every individual, be he high or low, to unfold a plain straightforward
tale, or else coil it and sit on it and hold his peace. Infractions of
this law should be punishable with death.</p>
<p>And eighthly, and last, I would retain ZUG and SCHLAG, with their
pendants, and discard the rest of the vocabulary. This would simplify
the language.</p>
<p>I have now named what I regard as the most necessary and important
changes. These are perhaps all I could be expected to name for nothing;
but there are other suggestions which I can and will make in case my
proposed application shall result in my being formally employed by the
government in the work of reforming the language.</p>
<p>My philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought
to learn English (barring spelling and pronouncing) in thirty hours,
French in thirty days, and German in thirty years. It seems manifest,
then, that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired. If
it is to remain as it is, it ought to be gently and reverently set aside
among the dead languages, for only the dead have time to learn it.</p>
<p>A FOURTH OF JULY ORATION IN THE GERMAN TONGUE, DELIVERED AT A BANQUET
OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CLUB OF STUDENTS BY THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK</p>
<p>Gentlemen: Since I arrived, a month ago, in this old wonderland, this
vast garden of Germany, my English tongue has so often proved a useless
piece of baggage to me, and so troublesome to carry around, in a country
where they haven’t the checking system for luggage, that I finally set
to work, and learned the German language. Also! Es freut mich dass dies
so ist, denn es muss, in ein hauptsaechlich degree, hoeflich sein, dass
man auf ein occasion like this, sein Rede in die Sprache des Landes
worin he boards, aussprechen soll. Dafuer habe ich, aus reinische
Verlegenheit–no, Vergangenheit–no, I mean Hoflichkeit–aus reinishe
Hoflichkeit habe ich resolved to tackle this business in the German
language, um Gottes willen! Also! Sie muessen so freundlich sein, und
verzeih mich die interlarding von ein oder zwei Englischer Worte, hie
und da, denn ich finde dass die deutsche is not a very copious language,
and so when you’ve really got anything to say, you’ve got to draw on a
language that can stand the strain.</p>
<p>Wenn haber man kann nicht meinem Rede Verstehen, so werde ich ihm
spaeter dasselbe uebersetz, wenn er solche Dienst verlangen wollen haben
werden sollen sein haette. (I don’t know what wollen haben werden sollen
sein haette means, but I notice they always put it at the end of a
German sentence–merely for general literary gorgeousness, I
suppose.)</p>
<p>This is a great and justly honored day–a day which is worthy of the
veneration in which it is held by the true patriots of all climes and
nationalities–a day which offers a fruitful theme for thought and
speech; und meinem Freunde–no, meinEN FreundEN–meinES FreundES–well,
take your choice, they’re all the same price; I don’t know which one is
right–also! ich habe gehabt haben worden gewesen sein, as Goethe says in
his Paradise Lost–ich–ich–that is to say–ich–but let us change cars.</p>
<p>Also! Die Anblich so viele Grossbrittanischer und Amerikanischer hier
zusammengetroffen in Bruderliche concord, ist zwar a welcome and
inspiriting spectacle. And what has moved you to it? Can the terse
German tongue rise to the expression of this impulse? Is it
Freundschaftsbezeigungenstadtverordneten-
versammlungenfamilieneigenthuemlichkeiten? Nein, o nein! This is a crisp
and noble word, but it fails to pierce the marrow of the impulse which
has gathered this friendly meeting and produced diese Anblick–eine
Anblich welche ist gut zu sehen–gut fuer die Augen in a foreign land and
a far country–eine Anblick solche als in die gewoehnliche Heidelberger
phrase nennt man ein “schoenes Aussicht!“ Ja, freilich natuerlich
wahrscheinlich ebensowohl! Also! Die Aussicht auf dem Koenigsstuhl mehr
groesser ist, aber geistlische sprechend nicht so schoen, lob’ Gott!
Because sie sind hier zusammengetroffen, in Bruderlichem concord, ein
grossen Tag zu feirn, whose high benefits were not for one land and one
locality, but have conferred a measure of good upon all lands that know
liberty today, and love it. Hundert Jahre vorueber, waren die Englaender
und die Amerikaner Feinde; aber heut sind sie herzlichen Freunde, Gott
sei Dank! May this good-fellowship endure; may these banners here
blended in amity so remain; may they never any more wave over opposing
hosts, or be stained with blood which was kindred, is kindred, and
always will be kindred, until a line drawn upon a map shall be able to
say: “THIS bars the ancestral blood from flowing in the veins of the
descendant!“</p>
<p>APPENDIX E Legend of the Castles</p>
<p>Called the “Swallow’s Nest“ and “The Brothers,“ as Condensed from the
Captain’s Tale</p>
<p>In the neighborhood of three hundred years ago the Swallow’s Nest and
the larger castle between it and Neckarsteinach were owned and occupied
by two old knights who were twin brothers, and bachelors. They had no
relatives. They were very rich. They had fought through the wars and
retired to private life–covered with honorable scars. They were honest,
honorable men in their dealings, but the people had given them a couple
of nicknames which were very suggestive–Herr Givenaught and Herr
Heartless. The old knights were so proud of these names that if a
burgher called them by their right ones they would correct them.</p>
<p>The most renowned scholar in Europe, at the time, was the Herr Doctor
Franz Reikmann, who lived in Heidelberg. All Germany was proud of the
venerable scholar, who lived in the simplest way, for great scholars are
always poor. He was poor, as to money, but very rich in his sweet young
daughter Hildegarde and his library. He had been all his life collecting
his library, book and book, and he lived it as a miser loves his hoarded
gold. He said the two strings of his heart were rooted, the one in his
daughter, the other in his books; and that if either were severed he
must die. Now in an evil hour, hoping to win a marriage portion for his
child, this simple old man had entrusted his small savings to a sharper
to be ventured in a glittering speculation. But that was not the worst
of it: he signed a paper–without reading it. That is the way with poets
and scholars; they always sign without reading. This cunning paper made
him responsible for heaps of things. The rest was that one night he
found himself in debt to the sharper eight thousand pieces of gold!–an
amount so prodigious that it simply stupefied him to think of it. It was
a night of woe in that house.</p>
<p>“I must part with my library–I have nothing else. So perishes one
heartstring,“ said the old man.</p>
<p>“What will it bring, father?“ asked the girl.</p>
<p>“Nothing! It is worth seven hundred pieces of gold; but by auction it
will go for little or nothing.“</p>
<p>“Then you will have parted with the half of your heart and the joy of
your life to no purpose, since so mighty of burden of debt will remain
behind.“</p>
<p>“There is no help for it, my child. Our darlings must pass under the
hammer. We must pay what we can.“</p>
<p>“My father, I have a feeling that the dear Virgin will come to our
help. Let us not lose heart.“</p>
<p>“She cannot devise a miracle that will turn NOTHING into eight
thousand gold pieces, and lesser help will bring us little peace.“</p>
<p>“She can do even greater things, my father. She will save us, I know
she will.“</p>
<p>Toward morning, while the old man sat exhausted and asleep in his
chair where he had been sitting before his books as one who watches by
his beloved dead and prints the features on his memory for a solace in
the aftertime of empty desolation, his daughter sprang into the room and
gently woke him, saying–</p>
<p>“My presentiment was true! She will save us. Three times has she
appeared to me in my dreams, and said, ‘Go to the Herr Givenaught, go to
the Herr Heartless, ask them to come and bid.’ There, did I not tell you
she would save us, the thrice blessed Virgin!“</p>
<p>Sad as the old man was, he was obliged to laugh.</p>
<p>“Thou mightest as well appeal to the rocks their castles stand upon
as to the harder ones that lie in those men’s breasts, my child. THEY
bid on books writ in the learned tongues!–they can scarce read their
own.“</p>
<p>But Hildegarde’s faith was in no wise shaken. Bright and early she
was on her way up the Neckar road, as joyous as a bird.</p>
<p>Meantime Herr Givenaught and Herr Heartless were having an early
breakfast in the former’s castle–the Sparrow’s Nest–and flavoring it
with a quarrel; for although these twins bore a love for each other
which almost amounted to worship, there was one subject upon which they
could not touch without calling each other hard names –and yet it was
the subject which they oftenest touched upon.</p>
<p>“I tell you,“ said Givenaught, “you will beggar yourself yet with
your insane squanderings of money upon what you choose to consider poor
and worthy objects. All these years I have implored you to stop this
foolish custom and husband your means, but all in vain. You are always
lying to me about these secret benevolences, but you never have managed
to deceive me yet. Every time a poor devil has been set upon his feet I
have detected your hand in it–incorrigible ass!“</p>
<p>“Every time you didn’t set him on his feet yourself, you mean. Where
I give one unfortunate a little private lift, you do the same for a
dozen. The idea of YOUR swelling around the country and petting yourself
with the nickname of Givenaught–intolerable humbug! Before I would be
such a fraud as that, I would cut my right hand off. Your life is a
continual lie. But go on, I have tried MY best to save you from
beggaring yourself by your riotous charities–now for the thousandth time
I wash my hands of the consequences. A maundering old fool! that’s what
you are.“</p>
<p>“And you a blethering old idiot!“ roared Givenaught, springing
up.</p>
<p>“I won’t stay in the presence of a man who has no more delicacy than
to call me such names. Mannerless swine!“</p>
<p>So saying, Herr Heartless sprang up in a passion. But some lucky
accident intervened, as usual, to change the subject, and the daily
quarrel ended in the customary daily living reconciliation. The
gray-headed old eccentrics parted, and Herr Heartless walked off to his
own castle.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Hildegarde was standing in the presence of Herr
Givenaught. He heard her story, and said–</p>
<p>“I am sorry for you, my child, but I am very poor, I care nothing for
bookish rubbish, I shall not be there.“</p>
<p>He said the hard words kindly, but they nearly broke poor
Hildegarde’s heart, nevertheless. When she was gone the old heartbreaker
muttered, rubbing his hands–</p>
<p>“It was a good stroke. I have saved my brother’s pocket this time, in
spite of him. Nothing else would have prevented his rushing off to
rescue the old scholar, the pride of Germany, from his trouble. The poor
child won’t venture near HIM after the rebuff she has received from his
brother the Givenaught.“</p>
<p>But he was mistaken. The Virgin had commanded, and Hildegarde would
obey. She went to Herr Heartless and told her story. But he said
coldly–</p>
<p>“I am very poor, my child, and books are nothing to me. I wish you
well, but I shall not come.“</p>
<p>When Hildegarde was gone, he chuckled and said–</p>
<p>“How my fool of a soft-headed soft-hearted brother would rage if he
knew how cunningly I have saved his pocket. How he would have flown to
the old man’s rescue! But the girl won’t venture near him now.“</p>
<p>When Hildegarde reached home, her father asked her how she had
prospered. She said–</p>
<p>“The Virgin has promised, and she will keep her word; but not in the
way I thought. She knows her own ways, and they are best.“</p>
<p>The old man patted her on the head, and smiled a doubting smile, but
he honored her for her brave faith, nevertheless.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Next day the people assembled in the great hall of the Ritter tavern,
to witness the auction–for the proprietor had said the treasure of
Germany’s most honored son should be bartered away in no meaner place.
Hildegarde and her father sat close to the books, silent and sorrowful,
and holding each other’s hands. There was a great crowd of people
present. The bidding began–</p>
<p>“How much for this precious library, just as it stands, all
complete?“ called the auctioneer.</p>
<p>“Fifty pieces of gold!“</p>
<p>“A hundred!“</p>
<p>“Two hundred.“</p>
<p>“Three!“</p>
<p>“Four!“</p>
<p>“Five hundred!“</p>
<p>“Five twenty-five.“</p>
<p>A brief pause.</p>
<p>“Five forty!“</p>
<p>A longer pause, while the auctioneer redoubled his persuasions.</p>
<p>“Five-forty-five!“</p>
<p>A heavy drag–the auctioneer persuaded, pleaded, implored–it was
useless, everybody remained silent–</p>
<p>“Well, then–going, going–one–two–“</p>
<p>“Five hundred and fifty!“</p>
<p>This in a shrill voice, from a bent old man, all hung with rags, and
with a green patch over his left eye. Everybody in his vicinity turned
and gazed at him. It was Givenaught in disguise. He was using a
disguised voice, too.</p>
<p>“Good!“ cried the auctioneer. “Going, going–one–two–“</p>
<p>“Five hundred and sixty!“</p>
<p>This, in a deep, harsh voice, from the midst of the crowd at the
other end of the room. The people near by turned, and saw an old man, in
a strange costume, supporting himself on crutches. He wore a long white
beard, and blue spectacles. It was Herr Heartless, in disguise, and
using a disguised voice.</p>
<p>“Good again! Going, going–one–“</p>
<p>“Six hundred!“</p>
<p>Sensation. The crowd raised a cheer, and some one cried out, “Go it,
Green-patch!“ This tickled the audience and a score of voices shouted,
“Go it, Green-patch!“</p>
<p>“Going–going–going–third and last call–one–two–“</p>
<p>“Seven hundred!“</p>
<p>“Huzzah!–well done, Crutches!“ cried a voice. The crowd took it up,
and shouted altogether, “Well done, Crutches!“</p>
<p>“Splendid, gentlemen! you are doing magnificently. Going, going–“</p>
<p>“A thousand!“</p>
<p>“Three cheers for Green-patch! Up and at him, Crutches!“</p>
<p>“Going–going–“</p>
<p>“Two thousand!“</p>
<p>And while the people cheered and shouted, “Crutches“ muttered, “Who
can this devil be that is fighting so to get these useless books?–But no
matter, he sha’n’t have them. The pride of Germany shall have his books
if it beggars me to buy them for him.“</p>
<p>“Going, going, going–“</p>
<p>“Three thousand!“</p>
<p>“Come, everybody–give a rouser for Green-patch!“</p>
<p>And while they did it, “Green-patch“ muttered, “This cripple is
plainly a lunatic; but the old scholar shall have his books,
nevertheless, though my pocket sweat for it.“</p>
<p>“Going–going–“</p>
<p>“Four thousand!“</p>
<p>“Huzza!“</p>
<p>“Five thousand!“</p>
<p>“Huzza!“</p>
<p>“Six thousand!“</p>
<p>“Huzza!“</p>
<p>“Seven thousand!“</p>
<p>“Huzza!“</p>
<p>“EIGHT thousand!“</p>
<p>“We are saved, father! I told you the Holy Virgin would keep her
word!“ “Blessed be her sacred name!“ said the old scholar, with emotion.
The crowd roared, “Huzza, huzza, huzza–at him again, Green-patch!“</p>
<p>“Going–going–“</p>
<p>“TEN thousand!“ As Givenaught shouted this, his excitement was so
great that he forgot himself and used his natural voice. He brother
recognized it, and muttered, under cover of the storm of cheers–</p>
<p>“Aha, you are there, are you, besotted old fool? Take the books, I
know what you’ll do with them!“</p>
<p>So saying, he slipped out of the place and the auction was at an end.
Givenaught shouldered his way to Hildegarde, whispered a word in her
ear, and then he also vanished. The old scholar and his daughter
embraced, and the former said, “Truly the Holy Mother has done more than
she promised, child, for she has give you a splendid marriage portion
–think of it, two thousand pieces of gold!“</p>
<p>“And more still,“ cried Hildegarde, “for she has give you back your
books; the stranger whispered me that he would none of them–‘the honored
son of Germany must keep them,’ so he said. I would I might have asked
his name and kissed his hand and begged his blessing; but he was Our
Lady’s angel, and it is not meet that we of earth should venture speech
with them that dwell above.“</p>
<p>APPENDIX F German Journals</p>
<p>The daily journals of Hamburg, Frankfort, Baden, Munich, and Augsburg
are all constructed on the same general plan. I speak of these because I
am more familiar with them than with any other German papers. They
contain no “editorials“ whatever; no “personals“–and this is rather a
merit than a demerit, perhaps; no funny-paragraph column; no
police-court reports; no reports of proceedings of higher courts; no
information about prize-fights or other dog-fights, horse-races,
walking-machines, yachting-contents, rifle-matches, or other sporting
matters of any sort; no reports of banquet speeches; no department of
curious odds and ends of floating fact and gossip; no “rumors“ about
anything or anybody; no prognostications or prophecies about anything or
anybody; no lists of patents granted or sought, or any reference to such
things; no abuse of public officials, big or little, or complaints
against them, or praises of them; no religious columns Saturdays, no
rehash of cold sermons Mondays; no “weather indications“; no “local
item“ unveiling of what is happening in town–nothing of a local nature,
indeed, is mentioned, beyond the movements of some prince, or the
proposed meeting of some deliberative body.</p>
<p>After so formidable a list of what one can’t find in a German daily,
the question may well be asked, What CAN be found in it? It is easily
answered: A child’s handful of telegrams, mainly about European national
and international political movements; letter-correspondence about the
same things; market reports. There you have it. That is what a German
daily is made of. A German daily is the slowest and saddest and
dreariest of the inventions of man. Our own dailies infuriate the
reader, pretty often; the German daily only stupefies him. Once a week
the German daily of the highest class lightens up its heavy columns–that
is, it thinks it lightens them up–with a profound, an abysmal, book
criticism; a criticism which carries you down, down, down into the
scientific bowels of the subject–for the German critic is nothing if not
scientific–and when you come up at last and scent the fresh air and see
the bonny daylight once more, you resolve without a dissenting voice
that a book criticism is a mistaken way to lighten up a German daily.
Sometimes, in place of the criticism, the first-class daily gives you
what it thinks is a gay and chipper essay–about ancient Grecian funeral
customs, or the ancient Egyptian method of tarring a mummy, or the
reasons for believing that some of the peoples who existed before the
flood did not approve of cats. These are not unpleasant subjects; they
are not uninteresting subjects; they are even exciting subjects –until
one of these massive scientists gets hold of them. He soon convinces you
that even these matters can be handled in such a way as to make a person
low-spirited.</p>
<p>As I have said, the average German daily is made up solely of
correspondences–a trifle of it by telegraph, the rest of it by mail.
Every paragraph has the side-head, “London,“ “Vienna,“ or some other
town, and a date. And always, before the name of the town, is placed a
letter or a sign, to indicate who the correspondent is, so that the
authorities can find him when they want to hang him. Stars, crosses,
triangles, squares, half-moons, suns –such are some of the signs used by
correspondents.</p>
<p>Some of the dailies move too fast, others too slowly. For instance,
my Heidelberg daily was always twenty-four hours old when it arrived at
the hotel; but one of my Munich evening papers used to come a full
twenty-four hours before it was due.</p>
<p>Some of the less important dailies give one a tablespoonful of a
continued story every day; it is strung across the bottom of the page,
in the French fashion. By subscribing for the paper for five years I
judge that a man might succeed in getting pretty much all of the
story.</p>
<p>If you ask a citizen of Munich which is the best Munich daily
journal, he will always tell you that there is only one good Munich
daily, and that it is published in Augsburg, forty or fifty miles away.
It is like saying that the best daily paper in New York is published out
in New Jersey somewhere. Yes, the Augsburg ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG is “the
best Munich paper,“ and it is the one I had in my mind when I was
describing a “first-class German daily“ above. The entire paper, opened
out, is not quite as large as a single page of the New York HERALD. It
is printed on both sides, of course; but in such large type that its
entire contents could be put, in HERALD type, upon a single page of the
HERALD–and there would still be room enough on the page for the
ZEITUNG’s “supplement“ and some portion of the ZEITUNG’s next day’s
contents.</p>
<p>Such is the first-class daily. The dailies actually printed in Munich
are all called second-class by the public. If you ask which is the best
of these second-class papers they say there is no difference; one is as
good as another. I have preserved a copy of one of them; it is called
the MUENCHENER TAGES-ANZEIGER, and bears date January 25, 1879.
Comparisons are odious, but they need not be malicious; and without any
malice I wish to compare this journals of other countries. I know of no
other way to enable the reader to “size“ the thing.</p>
<p>A column of an average daily paper in America contains from 1,800 to
2,500 words; the reading-matter in a single issue consists of from
25,000 to 50,000 words. The reading-matter in my copy of the Munich
journal consists of a total of 1,654 words –for I counted them. That
would be nearly a column of one of our dailies. A single issue of the
bulkiest daily newspaper in the world–the London TIMES–often contains
100,000 words of reading-matter. Considering that the DAILY ANZEIGER
issues the usual twenty-six numbers per month, the reading matter in a
single number of the London TIMES would keep it in “copy“ two months and
a half.</p>
<p>The ANZEIGER is an eight-page paper; its page is one inch wider and
one inch longer than a foolscap page; that is to say, the dimensions of
its page are somewhere between those of a schoolboy’s slate and a lady’s
pocket handkerchief. One-fourth of the first page is taken up with the
heading of the journal; this gives it a rather top-heavy appearance; the
rest of the first page is reading-matter; all of the second page is
reading-matter; the other six pages are devoted to advertisements.</p>
<p>The reading-matter is compressed into two hundred and five small-pica
lines, and is lighted up with eight pica headlines. The bill of fare is
as follows: First, under a pica headline, to enforce attention and
respect, is a four-line sermon urging mankind to remember that, although
they are pilgrims here below, they are yet heirs of heaven; and that
“When they depart from earth they soar to heaven.“ Perhaps a four-line
sermon in a Saturday paper is the sufficient German equivalent of the
eight or ten columns of sermons which the New-Yorkers get in their
Monday morning papers. The latest news (two days old) follows the
four-line sermon, under the pica headline “Telegrams“–these are
“telegraphed“ with a pair of scissors out of the AUGSBURGER ZEITUNG of
the day before. These telegrams consist of fourteen and two-thirds lines
from Berlin, fifteen lines from Vienna, and two and five-eights lines
from Calcutta. Thirty-three small-pica lines news in a daily journal in
a King’s Capital of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants is
surely not an overdose. Next we have the pica heading, “News of the
Day,“ under which the following facts are set forth: Prince Leopold is
going on a visit to Vienna, six lines; Prince Arnulph is coming back
from Russia, two lines; the Landtag will meet at ten o’clock in the
morning and consider an election law, three lines and one word over; a
city government item, five and one-half lines; prices of tickets to the
proposed grand Charity Ball, twenty-three lines–for this one item
occupies almost one-fourth of the entire first page; there is to be a
wonderful Wagner concert in Frankfurt-on-the-Main, with an orchestra of
one hundred and eight instruments, seven and one-half lines. That
concludes the first page. Eighty-five lines, altogether, on that page,
including three headlines. About fifty of those lines, as one perceives,
deal with local matters; so the reporters are not overworked.</p>
<p>Exactly one-half of the second page is occupied with an opera
criticism, fifty-three lines (three of them being headlines), and “Death
Notices,“ ten lines.</p>
<p>The other half of the second page is made up of two paragraphs under
the head of “Miscellaneous News.“ One of these paragraphs tells about a
quarrel between the Czar of Russia and his eldest son, twenty-one and a
half lines; and the other tells about the atrocious destruction of a
peasant child by its parents, forty lines, or one-fifth of the total of
the reading-matter contained in the paper.</p>
<p>Consider what a fifth part of the reading-matter of an American daily
paper issued in a city of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants
amounts to! Think what a mass it is. Would any one suppose I could so
snugly tuck away such a mass in a chapter of this book that it would be
difficult to find it again in the reader lost his place? Surely not. I
will translate that child-murder word for word, to give the reader a
realizing sense of what a fifth part of the reading-matter of a Munich
daily actually is when it comes under measurement of the eye:</p>
<p>“From Oberkreuzberg, January 21st, the DONAU ZEITUNG receives a long
account of a crime, which we shortened as follows: In Rametuach, a
village near Eppenschlag, lived a young married couple with two
children, one of which, a boy aged five, was born three years before the
marriage. For this reason, and also because a relative at Iggensbach had
bequeathed M400 (00) to the boy, the heartless father considered him in
the way; so the unnatural parents determined to sacrifice him in the
cruelest possible manner. They proceeded to starve him slowly to death,
meantime frightfully maltreating him–as the village people now make
known, when it is too late. The boy was shut in a hole, and when people
passed by he cried, and implored them to give him bread. His
long-continued tortures and deprivations destroyed him at last, on the
third of January. The sudden (sic) death of the child created suspicion,
the more so as the body was immediately clothed and laid upon the bier.
Therefore the coroner gave notice, and an inquest was held on the 6th.
What a pitiful spectacle was disclosed then! The body was a complete
skeleton. The stomach and intestines were utterly empty; they contained
nothing whatsoever. The flesh on the corpse was not as thick as the back
of a knife, and incisions in it brought not one drop of blood. There was
not a piece of sound skin the size of a dollar on the whole body;
wounds, scars, bruises, discolored extravasated blood, everywhere–even
on the soles of the feet there were wounds. The cruel parents asserted
that the boy had been so bad that they had been obliged to use severe
punishments, and that he finally fell over a bench and broke his neck.
However, they were arrested two weeks after the inquest and put in the
prison at Deggendorf.“</p>
<p>Yes, they were arrested “two weeks after the inquest.“ What a home
sound that has. That kind of police briskness rather more reminds me of
my native land than German journalism does.</p>
<p>I think a German daily journal doesn’t do any good to speak of, but
at the same time it doesn’t do any harm. That is a very large merit, and
should not be lightly weighted nor lightly thought of.</p>
<p>The German humorous papers are beautifully printed upon fine paper,
and the illustrations are finely drawn, finely engraved, and are not
vapidly funny, but deliciously so. So also, generally speaking, are the
two or three terse sentences which accompany the pictures. I remember
one of these pictures: A most dilapidated tramp is ruefully
contemplating some coins which lie in his open palm. He says: “Well,
begging is getting played out. Only about five marks (.25) for the whole
day; many an official makes more!“ And I call to mind a picture of a
commercial traveler who is about to unroll his samples:</p>
<p>MERCHANT (pettishly).–NO, don’t. I don’t want to buy anything!</p>
<p>DRUMMER.–If you please, I was only going to show you–</p>
<p>MERCHANT.–But I don’t wish to see them!</p>
<p>DRUMMER (after a pause, pleadingly).–But do you you mind letting ME
look at them! I haven’t seen them for three weeks!</p>

Lorde.</p>
<p>To those good-mannered and agreeable children Susie and Clara Clemens
this book is affectionately inscribed by their father.</p>
<p>I will set down a tale as it was told to me by one who had it of his
father, which latter had it of HIS father, this last having in like
manner had it of HIS father–and so on, back and still back, three
hundred years and more, the fathers transmitting it to the sons and so
preserving it. It may be history, it may be only a legend, a tradition.
It may have happened, it may not have happened: but it COULD have
happened. It may be that the wise and the learned believed it in the old
days; it may be that only the unlearned and the simple loved it and
credited it.</p>
