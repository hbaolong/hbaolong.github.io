<h4 id="chapter-1-when-wolves-ran-free-in-paris">CHAPTER 1 When Wolves
Ran Free in Paris</h4>
<p>I, THE SIEUR LOUIS DE CONTE, was born in Neufchateau, on the 6th of
January, 1410; that is to say, exactly two years before Joan of Arc was
born in Domremy. My family had fled to those distant regions from the
neighborhood of Paris in the first years of the century. In politics
they were Armagnacs–patriots; they were for our own French King, crazy
and impotent as he was. The Burgundian party, who were for the English,
had stripped them, and done it well. They took everything but my
father’s small nobility, and when he reached Neufchateau he reached it
in poverty and with a broken spirit. But the political atmosphere there
was the sort he liked, and that was something. He came to a region of
comparative quiet; he left behind him a region peopled with furies,
madmen, devils, where slaughter was a daily pastime and no man’s life
safe for a moment. In Paris, mobs roared through the streets nightly,
sacking, burning, killing, unmolested, uninterrupted. The sun rose upon
wrecked and smoking buildings, and upon mutilated corpses lying here,
there, and yonder about the streets, just as they fell, and stripped
naked by thieves, the unholy gleaners after the mob. None had the
courage to gather these dead for burial; they were left there to rot and
create plagues.</p>
<p>And plagues they did create. Epidemics swept away the people like
flies, and the burials were conducted secretly and by night, for public
funerals were not allowed, lest the revelation of the magnitude of the
plague’s work unman the people and plunge them into despair. Then came,
finally, the bitterest winter which had visited France in five hundred
years. Famine, pestilence, slaughter, ice, snow–Paris had all these at
once. The dead lay in heaps about the streets, and wolves entered the
city in daylight and devoured them.</p>
<p>Ah, France had fallen low–so low! For more than three quarters of a
century the English fangs had been bedded in her flesh, and so cowed had
her armies become by ceaseless rout and defeat that it was said and
accepted that the mere sight of an English army was sufficient to put a
French one to flight.</p>
<p>When I was five years old the prodigious disaster of Agincourt fell
upon France; and although the English King went home to enjoy his glory,
he left the country prostrate and a prey to roving bands of Free
Companions in the service of the Burgundian party, and one of these
bands came raiding through Neufchateau one night, and by the light of
our burning roof-thatch I saw all that were dear to me in this world
(save an elder brother, your ancestor, left behind with the court)
butchered while they begged for mercy, and heard the butchers laugh at
their prayers and mimic their pleadings. I was overlooked, and escaped
without hurt. When the savages were gone I crept out and cried the night
away watching the burning houses; and I was all alone, except for the
company of the dead and the wounded, for the rest had taken flight and
hidden themselves.</p>
<p>I was sent to Domremy, to the priest, whose housekeeper became a
loving mother to me. The priest, in the course of time, taught me to
read and write, and he and I were the only persons in the village who
possessed this learning.</p>
<p>At the time that the house of this good priest, Guillaume Fronte,
became my home, I was six years old. We lived close by the village
church, and the small garden of Joan’s parents was behind the church. As
to that family there were Jacques d’Arc the father, his wife Isabel
Romee; three sons–Jacques, ten years old, Pierre, eight, and Jean,
seven; Joan, four, and her baby sister Catherine, about a year old. I
had these children for playmates from the beginning. I had some other
playmates besides–particularly four boys: Pierre Morel, Etienne Roze,
Noel Rainguesson, and Edmond Aubrey, whose father was maire at that
time; also two girls, about Joan’s age, who by and by became her
favorites; one was named Haumetter, the other was called Little
Mengette. These girls were common peasant children, like Joan herself.
When they grew up, both married common laborers. Their estate was lowly
enough, you see; yet a time came, many years after, when no passing
stranger, howsoever great he might be, failed to go and pay his
reverence to those to humble old women who had been honored in their
youth by the friendship of Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>These were all good children, just of the ordinary peasant type; not
bright, of course–you would not expect that–but good-hearted and
companionable, obedient to their parents and the priest; and as they
grew up they became properly stocked with narrowness and prejudices got
at second hand from their elders, and adopted without reserve; and
without examination also–which goes without saying. Their religion was
inherited, their politics the same. John Huss and his sort might find
fault with the Church, in Domremy it disturbed nobody’s faith; and when
the split came, when I was fourteen, and we had three Popes at once,
nobody in Domremy was worried about how to choose among them–the Pope of
Rome was the right one, a Pope outside of Rome was no Pope at all. Every
human creature in the village was an Armagnac–a patriot–and if we
children hotly hated nothing else in the world, we did certainly hate
the English and Burgundian name and polity in that way.</p>
