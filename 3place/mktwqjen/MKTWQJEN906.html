1870-71. MARK TWAIN IN BUFFALO. MARRIAGE. THE BUFFALO EXPRESS.
“MEMORANDA.“ LECTURES. A NEW BOOK</h4>
<p>Samuel L. Clemens and Olivia Langdon were married in the Langdon home
at Elmira, February 2, 1870, and took up their residence in Buffalo in a
beautiful home, a wedding present from the bride’s father. The story of
their wedding, and the amusing circumstances connected with their
establishment in Buffalo, have been told elsewhere.–[Mark Twain: A
Biography, chap. lxxiv.]</p>
<p>Mark Twain now believed that he was through with lecturing. Two
letters to Redpath, his agent, express his comfortable condition.</p>
<p>To James Redpath, in Boston:</p>
<p>BUFFALO, March 22, 1890. DEAR RED,–I am not going to lecture any more
forever. I have got things ciphered down to a fraction now. I know just
about what it will cost us to live and I can make the money without
lecturing. Therefore old man, count me out. Your friend, S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>To James Redpath, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, N. Y. May 10, 1870. FRIEND REDPATH,–I guess I am out of the
field permanently.</p>
<p>Have got a lovely wife; a lovely house, bewitchingly furnished; a
lovely carriage, and a coachman whose style and dignity are simply
awe-inspiring–nothing less–and I am making more money than necessary –by
considerable, and therefore why crucify myself nightly on the platform.
The subscriber will have to be excused from the present season at
least.</p>
<p>Remember me to Nasby, Billings and Fall.–[Redpath’s partner in the
lecture lyceum.]–Luck to you! I am going to print your menagerie, Parton
and all, and make comments.</p>
<p>In next Galaxy I give Nasby’s friend and mine from Philadelphia (John
Quill, a literary thief) a “hyste.“ Yours always and after. MARK.</p>
<p>The reference to the Galaxy in the foregoing letter has to do with a
department called Memoranda, which he had undertaken to conduct for the
new magazine. This work added substantially to his income, and he
believed it would be congenial. He was allowed free hand to write and
print what he chose, and some of his best work at this time was
published in the new department, which he continued for a year.</p>
<p>Mark Twain now seemed to have his affairs well regulated. His mother
and sister were no longer far away in St. Louis. Soon after his marriage
they had, by his advice, taken up residence at Fredonia, New York, where
they could be easily visited from Buffalo.</p>
<p>Altogether, the outlook seemed bright to Mark Twain and his wife,
during the first months of their marriage. Then there came a change. In
a letter which Clemens wrote to his mother and sister we get the first
chapter of disaster.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens, and Mrs. Moffett, in Fredonia, N. Y.:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, N. Y. June 25, 1870. MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–We were
called here suddenly by telegram, 3 days ago. Mr. Langdon is very low.
We have well-nigh lost hope–all of us except Livy.</p>
<p>Mr. Langdon, whose hope is one of his most prominent characteristics,
says himself, this morning, that his recovery is only a possibility, not
a probability. He made his will this morning–that is, appointed
executors–nothing else was necessary. The household is sad enough
Charley is in Bavaria. We telegraphed Munroe andandandand Co. Paris, to
notify Charley to come home–they sent the message to Munich. Our message
left here at 8 in the morning and Charley’s answer arrived less than
eight hours afterward. He sailed immediately.</p>
<p>He will reach home two weeks from now. The whole city is troubled. As
I write (at the office,) a dispatch arrives from Charley who has reached
London, and will sail thence on 28th. He wants news. We cannot send him
any. Affectionately SAM.</p>
<p>P. S. I sent 00 to Fredonia Bank for Ma–It is in her name.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens, herself, was not in the best of health at this time,
but devotion to her father took her to his bedside, where she insisted
upon standing long, hard watches, the strain of which told upon her
severely. Meantime, work must go on; the daily demand of the newspaper
and the monthly call of the Memoranda could not go unheeded. Also, Bliss
wanted a new book, and met Mark Twain at Elmira to arrange for it. In a
letter to Orion we learn of this project.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, July 15, 1870 MY DEAR BRO.,–Per contract I must have another
600-page book ready for my publisher Jan. z, and I only began it today.
The subject of it is a secret, because I may possibly change it. But as
it stands, I propose to do up Nevada and Cal., beginning with the trip
across the country in the stage. Have you a memorandum of the route we
took–or the names of any of the Stations we stopped at? Do you remember
any of the scenes, names, incidents or adventures of the coach trip?–for
I remember next to nothing about the matter. Jot down a foolscap page of
items for me. I wish I could have two days’ talk with you.</p>
<p>I suppose I am to get the biggest copyright, this time, ever paid on
a subscription book in this country.</p>
<p>Give our love to Mollie.–Mr. Langdon is very low. Yr Bro SAM.</p>
<p>The “biggest copyright,“ mentioned in this letter, was a royalty of 7
1/2 per cent., which Bliss had agreed to pay, on the retail price of the
book. The book was Roughing It, though this title was not decided upon
until considerably later. Orion Clemens eagerly furnished a detailed
memorandum of the route of their overland journey, which brought this
enthusiastic acknowledgment:</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>BUF., 1870. DEAR BRO.,–I find that your little memorandum book is
going to be ever so much use to me, and will enable me to make quite a
coherent narrative of the Plains journey instead of slurring it over and
jumping 2,000 miles at a stride. The book I am writing will sell. In
return for the use of the little memorandum book I shall take the
greatest pleasure in forwarding to you the third ,000 which the
publisher of the forthcoming work sends me or the first ,000, I am not
particular–they will both be in the first quarterly statement of account
from the publisher. In great haste, Yr Obliged Bro. SAM.</p>
<p>Love to Mollie. We are all getting along tolerably well.</p>
<p>Mr. Langdon died early in August, and Mrs. Clemens returned to
Buffalo, exhausted in mind and body. If she hoped for rest now, in the
quiet of her own home, she was disappointed, as the two brief letters
that follow clearly show.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Moffett, in Fredonia, N. Y.:</p>
<p>BUFFALO, Aug. 31, 70. MY DEAR SISTER,–I know I ought to be thrashed
for not writing you, but I have kept putting it off. We get heaps of
letters every day; it is a comfort to have somebody like you that will
let us shirk and be patient over it. We got the book and I did think I
wrote a line thanking you for it-but I suppose I neglected it.</p>
<p>We are getting along tolerably well. Mother [Mrs. Langdon] is here,
and Miss Emma Nye. Livy cannot sleep since her father’s death–but I give
her a narcotic every night and make her. I am just as busy as I can be
–am still writing for the Galaxy and also writing a book like the
“Innocents“ in size and style. I have got my work ciphered down to days,
and I haven’t a single day to spare between this and the date which, by
written contract I am to deliver the M.S. of the book to the publisher.
—-In a hurry Affectionately SAM</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in St, Louis:</p>
<p>BUF. Sept. 9th, 1870. MY DEAR BRO,–O here! I don’t want to be
consulted at all about Tenn. I don’t want it even mentioned to me. When
I make a suggestion it is for you to act upon it or throw it aside, but
I beseech you never to ask my advice, opinion or consent about that
hated property. If it was because I felt the slightest personal interest
in the infernal land that I ever made a suggestion, the suggestion would
never be made.</p>
<p>Do exactly as you please with the land–always remember this–that so
trivial a percentage as ten per cent will never sell it.</p>
<p>It is only a bid for a somnambulist.</p>
<p>I have no time to turn round, a young lady visitor (schoolmate of
Livy’s) is dying in the house of typhoid fever (parents are in South
Carolina) and the premises are full of nurses and doctors and we are all
fagged out. Yrs. SAM.</p>
<p>Miss Nye, who had come to cheer her old schoolmate, had been
prostrated with the deadly fever soon after her arrival. Another period
of anxiety and nursing followed. Mrs. Clemens, in spite of her frail
health, devoted much time to her dying friend, until by the time the end
came she was herself in a precarious condition. This was at the end of
September. A little more than a month later, November 7th, her first
child, Langdon Clemens, was prematurely born. To the Rev. Joseph H.
Twichell and wife, of Hartford, Mark Twain characteristically announced
the new arrival.</p>
<p>To Rev. Joseph H. Twichell and wife, in Hartford, Conn.:</p>
<p>BUFFALO, Nov 12, ’70. DEAR UNCLE AND AUNT,–I came into the world on
the 7th inst., and consequently am about five days old, now. I have had
wretched health ever since I made my appearance. First one thing and
then another has kept me under the weather, and as a general thing I
have been chilly and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I am not corpulent, nor am I robust in any way. At birth I only
weighed 4 1/2 pounds with my clothes on–and the clothes were the chief
feature of the weight, too, I am obliged to confess. But I am doing
finely, all things considered. I was at a standstill for 3 days and a
half, but during the last 24 hours I have gained nearly an ounce,
avoirdupois.</p>
<p>They all say I look very old and venerable-and I am aware, myself,
that I never smile. Life seems a serious thing, what I have seen of
it–and my observation teaches me that it is made up mainly of hiccups,
unnecessary washings, and colic. But no doubt you, who are old, have
long since grown accustomed and reconciled to what seems to me such a
disagreeable novelty.</p>
<p>My father said, this morning, when my face was in repose and
thoughtful, that I looked precisely as young Edward Twichell of Hartford
used to look some is months ago–chin, mouth, forehead,
expression–everything.</p>
<p>My little mother is very bright and cheery, and I guess she is pretty
happy, but I don’t know what about. She laughs a great deal,
notwithstanding she is sick abed. And she eats a great deal, though she
says that is because the nurse desires it. And when she has had all the
nurse desires her to have, she asks for more. She is getting along very
well indeed.</p>
<p>My aunt Susie Crane has been here some ten days or two weeks, but
goes home today, and Granny Fairbanks of Cleveland arrives to take her
place. –[Mrs. Fairbanks, of the Quaker City excursion.] Very lovingly,
LANGDON CLEMENS.</p>
<p>P. S. Father said I had better write because you would be more
interested in me, just now, than in the rest of the family.</p>
<p>Clemens had made the acquaintance of the Rev. Joseph Hopkins Twichell
and his wife during his several sojourns in Hartford, in connection with
his book publication, and the two men had immediately become firm
friends. Twichell had come to Elmira in February to the wedding to
assist Rev. Thos. K. Beecher in the marriage ceremony. Joseph Twichell
was a devout Christian, while Mark Twain was a doubter, even a scoffer,
where orthodoxy was concerned, yet the sincerity and humanity of the two
men drew them together; their friendship was lifelong.</p>
<p>A second letter to Twichell, something more than a month later, shows
a somewhat improved condition in the Clemens household.</p>
<p>To Rev. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>BUF. Dec. 19th, 1870. DEAR J. H.,–All is well with us, I
believe–though for some days the baby was quite ill. We consider him
nearly restored to health now, however. Ask my brother about us–you will
find him at Bliss’s publishing office, where he is gone to edit Bliss’s
new paper–left here last Monday. Make his and his wife’s acquaintance.
Take Mrs. T. to see them as soon as they are fixed.</p>
<p>Livy is up, and the prince keeps her busy and anxious these latter
days and nights, but I am a bachelor up stairs and don’t have to jump up
and get the soothing syrup–though I would as soon do it as not, I assure
you. (Livy will be certain to read this letter.)</p>
<p>Tell Harmony (Mrs. T.) that I do hold the baby, and do it pretty
handily, too, although with occasional apprehensions that his loose head
will fall off. I don’t have to quiet him–he hardly ever utters a cry. He
is always thinking about something. He is a patient, good little
baby.</p>
<p>Smoke? I always smoke from 3 till 5 Sunday afternoons–and in New York
the other day I smoked a week, day and night. But when Livy is well I
smoke only those two hours on Sunday. I’m “boss“ of the habit, now, and
shall never let it boss me any more. Originally, I quit solely on Livy’s
account, (not that I believed there was the faintest reason in the
matter, but just as I would deprive myself of sugar in my coffee if she
wished it, or quit wearing socks if she thought them immoral,) and I
stick to it yet on Livy’s account, and shall always continue to do so,
without a pang. But somehow it seems a pity that you quit, for Mrs. T.
didn’t mind it if I remember rightly. Ah, it is turning one’s back upon
a kindly Providence to spurn away from us the good creature he sent to
make the breath of life a luxury as well as a necessity, enjoyable as
well as useful, to go and quit smoking when then ain’t any sufficient
excuse for it! Why, my old boy, when they use to tell me I would shorten
my life ten years by smoking, they little knew the devotee they were
wasting their puerile word upon–they little knew how trivial and
valueless I would regard a decade that had no smoking in it! But I won’t
persuade you, Twichell–I won’t until I see you again–but then we’ll
smoke for a week together, and then shut off again.</p>
<p>I would have gone to Hartford from New York last Saturday, but I got
so homesick I couldn’t. But maybe I’ll come soon.</p>
<p>No, Sir, catch me in the metropolis again, to get homesick.</p>
<p>I didn’t know Warner had a book out.</p>
<p>We send oceans and continents of love–I have worked myself down,
today. Yrs always MARK.</p>
<p>With his establishment in Buffalo, Clemens, as already noted, had
persuaded his sister, now a widow, and his mother, to settle in
Fredonia, not far away. Later, he had found a position for Orion, as
editor of a small paper which Bliss had established. What with these
several diversions and the sorrows and sicknesses of his own household,
we can readily imagine that literary work had been performed under
difficulties. Certainly, humorous writing under such disturbing
conditions could not have been easy, nor could we expect him to accept
an invitation to be present and make a comic speech at an agricultural
dinner, even though Horace Greeley would preside. However, he sent to
the secretary of the association a letter which might be read at the
gathering:</p>
<p>To A. B. Crandall, in Woodberry Falls, N. Y., to be read at an
agricultural dinner:</p>
<p>BUFFALO, Dec. 26, 1870. GENTLEMEN,–I thank you very much for your
invitation to the Agricultural dinner, and would promptly accept it and
as promptly be there but for the fact that Mr. Greeley is very busy this
month and has requested me to clandestinely continue for him in The
Tribune the articles “What I Know about Farming.“ Consequently the
necessity of explaining to the readers of that journal why buttermilk
cannot be manufactured profitably at 8 cents a quart out of butter that
costs 60 cents a pound compels my stay at home until the article is
written. With reiterated thanks, I am Yours truly, MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>In this letter Mark Twain made the usual mistake as to the title of
the Greeley farming series, “What I Know of Farming“ being the correct
form.</p>
<p>The Buffalo Express, under Mark Twain’s management, had become a sort
of repository for humorous efforts, often of an indifferent order. Some
of these things, signed by nom de plumes, were charged to Mark Twain.
When Bret Harte’s “Heathen Chinee“ devastated the country, and was so
widely parodied, an imitation of it entitled, “Three Aces,“ and signed
“Carl Byng,“ was printed in the Express. Thomas Bailey Aldrich, then
editor of Every Saturday, had not met Mark Twain, and, noticing the
verses printed in the exchanges over his signature, was one of those who
accepted them as Mark Twain’s work. He wrote rather an uncomplimentary
note in Every Saturday concerning the poem and its authorship,
characterizing it as a feeble imitation of Bret Harte’s “Heathen
Chinee.“ Clemens promptly protested to Aldrich, then as promptly
regretted having done so, feeling that he was making too much of a small
matter. Hurriedly he sent a second brief note.</p>
<p>To Thomas Bailey Aldrich, editor of “Every Saturday,“ Boston,
Massachusetts:</p>
<p>BUFFALO, Jan. 22, 1870. DEAR SIR,–Please do not publish the note I
sent you the other day about “Hy. Slocum’s“ plagiarism entitled “Three
Aces“–it is not important enough for such a long paragraph. Webb writes
me that he has put in a paragraph about it, too–and I have requested him
to suppress it. If you would simply state, in a line and a half under
“Literary Notes,“ that you mistook one “Hy. Slocum“ (no, it was one
“Carl Byng,“ I perceive) “Carl Byng“ for Mark Twain, and that it was the
former who wrote the plagiarism entitled “Three Aces,“ I think that
would do a fair justice without any unseemly display. But it is hard to
be accused of plagiarism–a crime I never have committed in my life. Yrs.
Truly MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>But this came too late. Aldrich replied that he could not be
prevented from doing him justice, as forty-two thousand copies of the
first note, with the editor’s apology duly appended, were already in
press. He would withdraw his apology in the next number of Every
Saturday, if Mark Twain said so. Mark Twain’s response this time assumed
the proportions of a letter.</p>
<p>To Thomas Bailey Aldrich, in Boston:</p>
<p>472 DELAWARE ST., BUFFALO, Jan. 28. DEAR MR. ALDRICH,–No indeed,
don’t take back the apology! Hang it, I don’t want to abuse a man’s
civility merely because he gives me the chance.</p>
<p>I hear a good deal about doing things on the “spur of the moment“ –I
invariably regret the things I do on the spur of the moment. That
disclaimer of mine was a case in point. I am ashamed every time I think
of my bursting out before an unconcerned public with that bombastic
pow-wow about burning publishers’ letters, and all that sort of
imbecility, and about my not being an imitator, etc. Who would find out
that I am a natural fool if I kept always cool and never let nature come
to the surface? Nobody.</p>
<p>But I did hate to be accused of plagiarizing Bret Harte, who trimmed
and trained and schooled me patiently until he changed me from an
awkward utterer of coarse grotesquenesses to a writer of paragraphs and
chapters that have found a certain favor in the eyes of even some of the
very decentest people in the land–and this grateful remembrance of mine
ought to be worth its face, seeing that Bret broke our long friendship a
year ago without any cause or provocation that I am aware of.</p>
<p>Well, it is funny, the reminiscences that glare out from murky
corners of one’s memory, now and then, without warning. Just at this
moment a picture flits before me: Scene–private room in Barnum’s
Restaurant, Virginia, Nevada; present, Artemus Ward, Joseph T. Goodman,
(editor and proprietor Daily “Enterprise“), and “Dan de Quille“ and
myself, reporters for same; remnants of the feast thin and scattering,
but such tautology and repetition of empty bottles everywhere visible as
to be offensive to the sensitive eye; time, 2.30 A.M.; Artemus thickly
reciting a poem about a certain infant you wot of, and interrupting
himself and being interrupted every few lines by poundings of the table
and shouts of “Splendid, by Shorzhe!“ Finally, a long, vociferous,
poundiferous and vitreous jingling of applause announces the conclusion,
and then Artemus: “Let every man ‘at loves his fellow man and ’preciates
a poet ’at loves his fellow man, stan’ up!–Stan’ up and drink health and
long life to Thomas Bailey Aldrich!–and drink it stanning!“ (On all
hands fervent, enthusiastic, and sincerely honest attempts to comply.)
Then Artemus: “Well–consider it stanning, and drink it just as ye are!“
Which was done.</p>
<p>You must excuse all this stuff from a stranger, for the present, and
when I see you I will apologize in full.</p>
<p>Do you know the prettiest fancy and the neatest that ever shot
through Harte’s brain? It was this: When they were trying to decide upon
a vignette for the cover of the Overland, a grizzly bear (of the arms of
the State of California) was chosen. Nahl Bras. carved him and the page
was printed, with him in it, looking thus: [Rude sketch of a grizzly
bear.]</p>
<p>As a bear, he was a success–he was a good bear–. But then, it was
objected, that he was an objectless bear–a bear that meant nothing in
particular, signified nothing,–simply stood there snarling over his
shoulder at nothing–and was painfully and manifestly a boorish and
ill-natured intruder upon the fair page. All hands said that–none were
satisfied. They hated badly to give him up, and yet they hated as much
to have him there when there was no paint to him. But presently Harte
took a pencil and drew these two simple lines under his feet and behold
he was a magnificent success!–the ancient symbol of California savagery
snarling at the approaching type of high and progressive Civilization,
the first Overland locomotive!: [Sketch of a small section of railway
track.]</p>
<p>I just think that was nothing less than inspiration itself.</p>
<p>Once more I apologize, and this time I do it “stanning!“ Yrs. Truly
SAML. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The “two simple lines,“ of course, were the train rails under the
bear’s feet, and completed the striking cover design of the Overland
monthly.</p>
<p>The brief controversy over the “Three Aces“ was the beginning of
along and happy friendship between Aldrich and Mark Twain. Howells,
Aldrich, Twichell, and Charles Dudley Warner–these were Mark Twain’s
intimates, men that he loved, each for his own special charm and
worth.</p>
<p>Aldrich he considered the most brilliant of living men.</p>
<p>In his reply to Clemens’s letter, Aldrich declared that he was glad
now that, for the sake of such a letter, he had accused him falsely, and
added:</p>
<p>“Mem. Always abuse people.</p>
<p>“When you come to Boston, if you do not make your presence manifest
to me, I’ll put in a !! in ‘Every Saturday’ to the effect that though
you are generally known as Mark Twain your favorite nom de plume is
‘Barry Gray.’“</p>
<p>Clemens did not fail to let Aldrich know when he was in Boston again,
and the little coterie of younger writers forgathered to give him
welcome.</p>
<p>Buffalo agreed with neither Mrs. Clemens nor the baby. What with
nursing and anguish of mind, Mark Twain found that he could do nothing
on the new book, and that he must give up his magazine department. He
had lost interest in his paper and his surroundings in general.
Journalism and authorship are poor yoke-mates. To Onion Clemens, at this
time editing Bliss’s paper at Hartford, he explained the situation.</p>
<p>To Onion Clemens, in Hartford:</p>
<p>BUFFALO, 4th 1871. MY DEAR BRO,–What I wanted of the “Liar“ Sketch,
was to work it into the California book–which I shall do. But day before
yesterday I concluded to go out of the Galaxy on the strength of it, so
I have turned it into the last Memoranda I shall ever write, and
published it as a “specimen chapter“ of my forthcoming book.</p>
<p>I have written the Galaxy people that I will never furnish them
another article long or short, for any price but 00.00 cash–and have
requested them not to ask me for contributions any more, even at that
price.</p>
<p>I hope that lets them out, for I will stick to that. Now do try and
leave me clear out of the ‘Publisher’ for the present, for I am
endangering my reputation by writing too much–I want to get out of the
public view for awhile.</p>
<p>I am still nursing Livy night and day and cannot write anything. I am
nearly worn out. We shall go to Elmira ten days hence (if Livy can
travel on a mattress then,) and stay there till I have finished the
California book–say three months. But I can’t begin work right away when
I get there–must have a week’s rest, for I have been through 30 days’
terrific siege.</p>
<p>That makes it after the middle of March before I can go fairly to
work –and then I’ll have to hump myself and not lose a moment. You and
Bliss just put yourselves in my place and you will see that my hands are
full and more than full.</p>
<p>When I told Bliss in N. Y. that I would write something for the
Publisher I could not know that I was just about to lose fifty days. Do
you see the difference it makes? Just as soon as ever I can, I will send
some of the book M.S. but right in the first chapter I have got to alter
the whole style of one of my characters and re-write him clear through
to where I am now. It is no fool of a job, I can tell you, but the book
will be greatly bettered by it. Hold on a few days–four or five–and I
will see if I can get a few chapters fixed to send to Bliss.</p>
<p>I have offered this dwelling house and the Express for sale, and when
we go to Elmira we leave here for good. I shall not select a new home
till the book is finished, but we have little doubt that Hartford will
be the place.</p>
<p>We are almost certain of that. Ask Bliss how it would be to ship our
furniture to Hartford, rent an upper room in a building and unbox it and
store it there where somebody can frequently look after it. Is not the
idea good? The furniture is worth 0,000 or 2,000 and must not be jammed
into any kind of a place and left unattended to for a year.</p>
<p>The first man that offers 5,000 for our house can take it–it cost
that. What are taxes there? Here, all bunched together–of all kinds,
they are 7 per cent–simply ruin.</p>
<p>The things you have written in the Publisher are tip-top. In haste,
Yr Bro SAM</p>
<p>There are no further letters until the end of April, by which time
the situation had improved. Clemens had sold his interest in the Express
(though at a loss), had severed his magazine connection, and was located
at Quarry Farm, on a beautiful hilltop above Elmira, the home of
Mrs. Clemens’s sister, Mrs. Theodore Crane. The pure air and rest of
that happy place, where they were to spend so many idyllic summers, had
proved beneficial to the sick ones, and work on the new book progressed
in consequence. Then Mark Twain’s old editor, “Joe“ Goodman, came from
Virginia City for a visit, and his advice and encouragement were of the
greatest value. Clemens even offered to engage Goodman on a salary, to
remain until he had finished his book. Goodman declined the salary, but
extended his visit, and Mark Twain at last seems to have found himself
working under ideal conditions. He jubilantly reports his progress.</p>
<p>To Elisha Bliss, in Hartford:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Monday. May 15th 1871 FRIEND BLISS,–Yrs rec’d enclosing check
for 03.35 The old “Innocents“ holds out handsomely.</p>
<p>I have MS. enough on hand now, to make (allowing for engravings)
about 400 pages of the book–consequently am two-thirds done. I intended
to run up to Hartford about the middle of the week and take it along;
because it has chapters in it that ought by all means to be in the
prospectus; but I find myself so thoroughly interested in my work, now
(a thing I have not experienced for months) that I can’t bear to lose a
single moment of the inspiration. So I will stay here and peg away as
long as it lasts. My present idea is to write as much more as I have
already written, and then cull from the mass the very best chapters and
discard the rest. I am not half as well satisfied with the first part of
the book as I am with what I am writing now. When I get it done I want
to see the man who will begin to read it and not finish it. If it falls
short of the “Innocents“ in any respect I shall lose my guess.</p>
<p>When I was writing the “Innocents“ my daily stunt was 30 pages of MS
and I hardly ever got beyond it; but I have gone over that nearly every
day for the last ten. That shows that I am writing with a red-hot
interest. Nothing grieves me now–nothing troubles me, nothing bothers me
or gets my attention–I don’t think of anything but the book, and I don’t
have an hour’s unhappiness about anything and don’t care two cents
whether school keeps or not. It will be a bully book. If I keep up my
present lick three weeks more I shall be able and willing to scratch out
half of the chapters of the Overland narrative–and shall do it.</p>
<p>You do not mention having received my second batch of MS, sent a week
or two ago–about 100 pages.</p>
<p>If you want to issue a prospectus and go right to canvassing, say the
word and I will forward some more MS–or send it by hand–special
messenger. Whatever chapters you think are unquestionably good, we will
retain of course, so they can go into a prospectus as well one time as
another. The book will be done soon, now. I have 1200 pages of MS
already written and am now writing 200 a week–more than that, in fact;
during the past week wrote 23 one day, then 30, 33, 35, 52, and 65.
–How’s that?</p>
<p>It will be a starchy book, and should be full of snappy pictures
–especially pictures worked in with the letterpress. The dedication will
be worth the price of the volume–thus:</p>
<p>To the Late Cain. This Book is Dedicated:</p>
<p>Not on account of respect for his memory, for it merits little
respect; not on account of sympathy with him, for his bloody deed placed
him without the pale of sympathy, strictly speaking: but out of a mere
human commiseration for him that it was his misfortune to live in a dark
age that knew not the beneficent Insanity Plea.</p>
<p>I think it will do. Yrs. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>P. S.–The reaction is beginning and my stock is looking up. I am
getting the bulliest offers for books and almanacs; am flooded with
lecture invitations, and one periodical offers me ,000 cash for 12
articles, of any length and on any subject, treated humorously or
otherwise.</p>
<p>The suggested dedication “to the late Cain“ may have been the
humoristic impulse of the moment. At all events, it did not
materialize.</p>
<p>Clemens’s enthusiasm for work was now such that he agreed with
Redpath to return to the platform that autumn, and he began at once
writing lectures. His disposal of the Buffalo paper had left him
considerably in debt, and platforming was a sure and quick method of
retrenchment. More than once in the years ahead Mark Twain would return
to travel and one-night stands to lift a burden of debt. Brief letters
to Redpath of this time have an interest and even a humor of their
own.</p>
