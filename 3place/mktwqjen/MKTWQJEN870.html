<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>We may now make a final footing-up of Mrs. Eddy, and see what she is,
in the fulness of her powers. She is</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Metaphysical College Pastor Emeritus; President;
Board of Directors; Board of Education; Board of Lectureships; Future
Board of Trustees, Proprietor of the Publishing-House and Periodicals;
Treasurer; Clerk; Proprietor of the Teachers; Proprietor of the
Lecturers; Proprietor of the Missionaries; Proprietor of the Readers;
Dictator of the Services; sole Voice of the Pulpit; Proprietor of the
Sanhedrin; Sole Proprietor of the Creed. (Copyrighted.); Indisputable
Autocrat of the Branch Churches, with their life and death in her hands;
Sole Thinker for The First Church (and the others); Sole and Infallible
Expounder of Doctrine, in life and in death; Sole permissible
Discoverer, Denouncer, Judge, and Executioner of Ostensible Hypnotists;
Fifty-handed God of Excommunication–with a thunderbolt in every hand;
Appointer and Installer of the Pastor of all the Churches–the Perpetual
Pastor-Universal, Science and Health, “the Comforter.“</p>
<p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>XThere she stands-painted by herself. No witness but herself has been
allowed to testify. She stands there painted by her acts, and decorated
by her words. When she talks, she has only a decorative value as a
witness, either for or against herself, for she deals mainly in
unsupported assertion; and in the rare cases where she puts forward a
verifiable fact she gets out of it a meaning which it refuses to furnish
to anybody else. Also, when she talks, she is unstable, she wanders, she
is incurably inconsistent; what she says to-day she contradicts
tomorrow.</p>
<p>But her acts are consistent. They are always faithful to her, they
never misinterpret her, they are a mirror which always reflects her
exactly, precisely, minutely, unerringly, and always the same, to date,
with only those progressive little natural changes in stature, dress,
complexion, mood, and carriage that mark–exteriorly–the march of the
years and record the accumulations of experience,
while–interiorly–through all this steady drift of evolution the one
essential detail, the commanding detail, the master detail of the
make-up remains as it was in the beginning, suffers no change and can
suffer none; the basis of the character; the temperament, the
disposition, that indestructible iron framework upon which the character
is built, and whose shape it must take, and keep, throughout life. We
call it a person’s nature.</p>
<p>The man who is born stingy can be taught to give liberally–with his
hands; but not with his heart. The man born kind and compassionate can
have that disposition crushed down out of sight by embittering
experience; but if it were an organ the post-mortem would find it still
in his corpse. The man born ambitious of power and glory may live long
without finding it out, but when the opportunity comes he will know,
will strike for the largest thing within the limit of his chances at the
time-constable, perhaps–and will be glad and proud when he gets it, and
will write home about it. But he will not stop with that start; his
appetite will come again; and by-and-by again, and yet again; and when
he has climbed to police commissioner it will at last begin to dawn upon
him that what his Napoleon soul wants and was born for is something away
higher up–he does not quite know what, but Circumstance and Opportunity
will indicate the direction and he will cut a road through and find
out.</p>
<p>I think Mrs. Eddy was born with a far-seeing business-eye, but did
not know it; and with a great organizing and executive talent, and did
not know it; and with a large appetite for power and distinction, and
did not know it. I think the reason that her make did not show up until
middle life was that she had General Grant’s luck–Circumstance and
Opportunity did not come her way when she was younger. The qualities
that were born in her had to wait for circumstance and opportunity–but
they were there: they were there to stay, whether they ever got a chance
to fructify or not. If they had come early, they would have found her
ready and competent. And they–not she–would have determined what they
would set her at and what they would make of her. If they had elected to
commission her as second-assistant cook in a bankrupt boarding-house, I
know the rest of it–I know what would have happened. She would have
owned the boarding-house within six months; she would have had the late
proprietor on salary and humping himself, as the worldly say; she would
have had that boarding-house spewing money like a mint; she would have
worked the servants and the late landlord up to the limit; she would
have squeezed the boarders till they wailed, and by some mysterious
quality born in her she would have kept the affections of certain of the
lot whose love and esteem she valued, and flung the others down the back
area; in two years she would own all the boarding-houses in the town, in
five all the boarding-houses in the State, in twenty all the hotels in
America, in forty all the hotels on the planet, and would sit at home
with her finger on a button and govern the whole combination as easily
as a bench-manager governs a dog-show.</p>
<p>It would be a grand thing to see, and I feel a kind of disappointment
–but never mind, a religion is better and larger; and there is more to
it. And I have not been steeping myself in Christian Science all these
weeks without finding out that the one sensible thing to do with a
disappointment is to put it out of your mind and think of something
cheerfuler.</p>
<p>We outsiders cannot conceive of Mrs. Eddy’s Christian Science
Religion as being a sudden and miraculous birth, but only as a growth
from a seed planted by circumstances, and developed stage by stage by
command and compulsion of the same force. What the stages were we cannot
know, but are privileged to guess. She may have gotten the
mental-healing idea from Quimby–it had been experimented with for ages,
and was no one’s special property. [For the present, for convenience’
sake, let us proceed upon the hypothesis that that was all she got of
him, and that she put up the rest of the assets herself. This will
strain us, but let us try it.] In each and all its forms and under all
its many names, mental healing had had limits, always, and they were
rather narrow ones –Mrs. Eddy, let us imagine, removed the fence,
abolished the frontiers. Not by expanding mental-healing, but by
absorbing its small bulk into the vaster bulk of Christian
Science–Divine Science, The Holy Ghost, the Comforter–which was a quite
different and sublimer force, and one which had long lain dormant and
unemployed.</p>
<p>The Christian Scientist believes that the Spirit of God (life and
love) pervades the universe like an atmosphere; that whoso will study
Science and Health can get from it the secret of how to inhale that
transforming air; that to breathe it is to be made new; that from the
new man all sorrow, all care, all miseries of the mind vanish away, for
that only peace, contentment and measureless joy can live in that divine
fluid; that it purifies the body from disease, which is a vicious
creation of the gross human mind, and cannot continue to exist in the
presence of the Immortal Mind, the renewing Spirit of God.</p>
<p>The Scientist finds this reasonable, natural, and not harder to
believe than that the disease germ, a creature of darkness, perishes
when exposed to the light of the great sun–a new revelation of profane
science which no one doubts. He reminds us that the actinic ray, shining
upon lupus, cures it–a horrible disease which was incurable fifteen
years ago, and had been incurable for ten million years before; that
this wonder, unbelievable by the physicians at first, is believed by
them now; and so he is tranquilly confident that the time is coming when
the world will be educated up to a point where it will comprehend and
grant that the light of the Spirit of God, shining unobstructed upon the
soul, is an actinic ray which can purge both mind and body from disease
and set them free and make them whole.</p>
<p>It is apparent, then, that in Christian Science it is not one man’s
mind acting upon another man’s mind that heals; that it is solely the
Spirit of God that heals; that the healer’s mind performs no office but
to convey that force to the patient; that it is merely the wire which
carries the electric fluid, so to speak, and delivers the message.
Therefore, if these things be true, mental-healing and Science-healing
are separate and distinct processes, and no kinship exists between
them.</p>
<p>To heal the body of its ills and pains is a mighty benefaction, but
in our day our physicians and surgeons work a thousand
miracles–prodigies which would have ranked as miracles fifty years
ago–and they have so greatly extended their domination over disease that
we feel so well protected that we are able to look with a good deal of
composure and absence of hysterics upon the claims of new competitors in
that field.</p>
<p>But there is a mightier benefaction than the healing of the body, and
that is the healing of the spirit–which is Christian Science’s other
claim. So far as I know, so far as I can find out, it makes it good.
Personally I have not known a Scientist who did not seem serene,
contented, unharassed. I have not found an outsider whose observation of
Scientists furnished him a view that differed from my own. Buoyant
spirits, comfort of mind, freedom from care these happinesses we all
have, at intervals; but in the spaces between, dear me, the black hours!
They have put a curse upon the life of every human being I have ever
known, young or old. I concede not a single exception. Unless it might
be those Scientists just referred to. They may have been playing a part
with me; I hope they were not, and I believe they were not.</p>
<p>Time will test the Science’s claim. If time shall make it good; if
time shall prove that the Science can heal the persecuted spirit of man
and banish its troubles and keep it serene and sunny and content–why,
then Mrs. Eddy will have a monument that will reach above the clouds.
For if she did not hit upon that imperial idea and evolve it and deliver
it, its discoverer can never be identified with certainty, now, I think.
It is the giant feature, it is the sun that rides in the zenith of
Christian Science, the auxiliary features are of minor consequence [Let
us still leave the large “if“ aside, for the present, and proceed as if
it had no existence.]</p>
<p>It is not supposable that Mrs. Eddy realized, at first, the size of
her plunder. (No, find–that is the word; she did not realize the size of
her find, at first.) It had to grow upon her, by degrees, in accordance
with the inalterable custom of Circumstance, which works by stages, and
by stages only, and never furnishes any mind with all the materials for
a large idea at one time.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Mrs. Eddy was probably interested merely in the
mental-healing detail, and perhaps mainly interested in it pecuniary,
for she was poor.</p>
<p>She would succeed in anything she undertook. She would attract
pupils, and her commerce would grow. She would inspire in patient and
pupil confidence in her earnestness, her history is evidence that she
would not fail of that.</p>
<p>There probably came a time, in due course, when her students began to
think there was something deeper in her teachings than they had been
suspecting–a mystery beyond mental-healing, and higher. It is
conceivable that by consequence their manner towards her changed little
by little, and from respectful became reverent. It is conceivable that
this would have an influence upon her; that it would incline her to
wonder if their secret thought–that she was inspired–might not be a
well-grounded guess. It is conceivable that as time went on the thought
in their minds and its reflection in hers might solidify into
conviction.</p>
<p>She would remember, then, that as a child she had been called, more
than once, by a mysterious voice–just as had happened to little Samuel.
(Mentioned in her Autobiography.) She would be impressed by that ancient
reminiscence, now, and it could have a prophetic meaning for her.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that the persuasive influences around her and
within her would give a new and powerful impulse to her philosophizings,
and that from this, in time, would result that great birth, the healing
of body and mind by the inpouring of the Spirit of God–the central and
dominant idea of Christian Science–and that when this idea came she
would not doubt that it was an inspiration direct from Heaven.</p>
