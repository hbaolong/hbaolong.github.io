<h4 id="chapter-xxxiv.">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h4>
<p>When Laura had been in Washington three months, she was still the
same person, in one respect, that she was when she first arrived
there–that is to say, she still bore the name of Laura Hawkins.
Otherwise she was perceptibly changed.–</p>
<p>She had arrived in a state of grievous uncertainty as to what manner
of woman she was, physically and intellectually, as compared with
eastern women; she was well satisfied, now, that her beauty was
confessed, her mind a grade above the average, and her powers of
fascination rather extraordinary. So she, was at ease upon those points.
When she arrived, she was possessed of habits of economy and not
possessed of money; now she dressed elaborately, gave but little thought
to the cost of things, and was very well fortified financially. She kept
her mother and Washington freely supplied with money, and did the same
by Col. Sellers –who always insisted upon giving his note for loans–with
interest; he was rigid upon that; she must take interest; and one of the
Colonel’s greatest satisfactions was to go over his accounts and note
what a handsome sum this accruing interest amounted to, and what a
comfortable though modest support it would yield Laura in case reverses
should overtake her.</p>
<p>In truth he could not help feeling that he was an efficient shield
for her against poverty; and so, if her expensive ways ever troubled him
for a brief moment, he presently dismissed the thought and said to
himself, “Let her go on–even if she loses everything she is still
safe–this interest will always afford her a good easy income.“</p>
<p>Laura was on excellent terms with a great many members of Congress,
and there was an undercurrent of suspicion in some quarters that she was
one of that detested class known as “lobbyists;“ but what belle could
escape slander in such a city? Fairminded people declined to condemn her
on mere suspicion, and so the injurious talk made no very damaging
headway. She was very gay, now, and very celebrated, and she might well
expect to be assailed by many kinds of gossip. She was growing used to
celebrity, and could already sit calm and seemingly unconscious, under
the fire of fifty lorgnettes in a theatre, or even overhear the low
voice “That’s she!“ as she passed along the street without betraying
annoyance.</p>
<p>The whole air was full of a vague vast scheme which was to eventuate
in filling Laura’s pockets with millions of money; some had one idea of
the scheme, and some another, but nobody had any exact knowledge upon
the subject. All that any one felt sure about, was that Laura’s landed
estates were princely in value and extent, and that the government was
anxious to get hold of them for public purposes, and that Laura was
willing to make the sale but not at all anxious about the matter and not
at all in a hurry. It was whispered that Senator Dilworthy was a
stumbling block in the way of an immediate sale, because he was resolved
that the government should not have the lands except with the
understanding that they should be devoted to the uplifting of the negro
race; Laura did not care what they were devoted to, it was said, (a
world of very different gossip to the contrary notwithstanding,) but
there were several other heirs and they would be guided entirely by the
Senator’s wishes; and finally, many people averred that while it would
be easy to sell the lands to the government for the benefit of the
negro, by resorting to the usual methods of influencing votes, Senator
Dilworthy was unwilling to have so noble a charity sullied by any taint
of corruption–he was resolved that not a vote should be bought. Nobody
could get anything definite from Laura about these matters, and so
gossip had to feed itself chiefly upon guesses. But the effect of it all
was, that Laura was considered to be very wealthy and likely to be
vastly more so in a little while. Consequently she was much courted and
as much envied: Her wealth attracted many suitors. Perhaps they came to
worship her riches, but they remained to worship her. Some of the
noblest men of the time succumbed to her fascinations. She frowned upon
no lover when he made his first advances, but by and by when she was
hopelessly enthralled, he learned from her own lips that she had formed
a resolution never to marry. Then he would go away hating and cursing
the whole sex, and she would calmly add his scalp to her string, while
she mused upon the bitter day that Col. Selby trampled her love and her
pride in the dust. In time it came to be said that her way was paved
with broken hearts.</p>
<p>Poor Washington gradually woke up to the fact that he too was an
intellectual marvel as well as his gifted sister. He could not conceive
how it had come about (it did not occur to him that the gossip about his
family’s great wealth had any thing to do with it). He could not account
for it by any process of reasoning, and was simply obliged to accept the
fact and give up trying to solve the riddle. He found himself dragged
into society and courted, wondered at and envied very much as if he were
one of those foreign barbers who flit over here now and then with a
self-conferred title of nobility and marry some rich fool’s absurd
daughter. Sometimes at a dinner party or a reception he would find
himself the centre of interest, and feel unutterably uncomfortable in
the discovery. Being obliged to say something, he would mine his brain
and put in a blast and when the smoke and flying debris had cleared away
the result would be what seemed to him but a poor little intellectual
clod of dirt or two, and then he would be astonished to see everybody as
lost in admiration as if he had brought up a ton or two of virgin gold.
Every remark he made delighted his hearers and compelled their applause;
he overheard people say he was exceedingly bright–they were chiefly
mammas and marriageable young ladies. He found that some of his good
things were being repeated about the town. Whenever he heard of an
instance of this kind, he would keep that particular remark in mind and
analyze it at home in private. At first he could not see that the remark
was anything better than a parrot might originate; but by and by he
began to feel that perhaps he underrated his powers; and after that he
used to analyze his good things with a deal of comfort, and find in them
a brilliancy which would have been unapparent to him in earlier days–and
then he would make a note, of that good thing and say it again the first
time he found himself in a new company. Presently he had saved up quite
a repertoire of brilliancies; and after that he confined himself to
repeating these and ceased to originate any more, lest he might injure
his reputation by an unlucky effort.</p>
<p>He was constantly having young ladies thrust upon his notice at
receptions, or left upon his hands at parties, and in time he began to
feel that he was being deliberately persecuted in this way; and after
that he could not enjoy society because of his constant dread of these
female ambushes and surprises. He was distressed to find that nearly
every time he showed a young lady a polite attention he was straightway
reported to be engaged to her; and as some of these reports got into the
newspapers occasionally, he had to keep writing to Louise that they were
lies and she must believe in him and not mind them or allow them to
grieve her.</p>
<p>Washington was as much in the dark as anybody with regard to the
great wealth that was hovering in the air and seemingly on the point of
tumbling into the family pocket. Laura would give him no satisfaction.
All she would say, was:</p>
<p>“Wait. Be patient. You will see.“</p>
<p>“But will it be soon, Laura?“</p>
<p>“It will not be very long, I think.“</p>
<p>“But what makes you think so?“</p>
<p>“I have reasons–and good ones. Just wait, and be patient.“</p>
<p>“But is it going to be as much as people say it is?“</p>
<p>“What do they say it is?“</p>
<p>“Oh, ever so much. Millions!“</p>
<p>“Yes, it will be a great sum.“</p>
<p>“But how great, Laura? Will it be millions?“</p>
<p>“Yes, you may call it that. Yes, it will be millions. There, now–does
that satisfy you?“</p>
<p>“Splendid! I can wait. I can wait patiently–ever so patiently. Once I
was near selling the land for twenty thousand dollars; once for thirty
thousand dollars; once after that for seven thousand dollars; and once
for forty thousand dollars–but something always told me not to do it.
What a fool I would have been to sell it for such a beggarly trifle! It
is the land that’s to bring the money, isn’t it Laura? You can tell me
that much, can’t you?“</p>
<p>“Yes, I don’t mind saying that much. It is the land.</p>
<p>“But mind–don’t ever hint that you got it from me. Don’t mention me
in the matter at all, Washington.“</p>
<p>“All right–I won’t. Millions! Isn’t it splendid! I mean to look
around for a building lot; a lot with fine ornamental shrubbery and all
that sort of thing. I will do it to-day. And I might as well see an
architect, too, and get him to go to work at a plan for a house. I don’t
intend to spare and expense; I mean to have the noblest house that money
can build.“ Then after a pause–he did not notice Laura’s smiles “Laura,
would you lay the main hall in encaustic tiles, or just in fancy
patterns of hard wood?“</p>
<p>Laura laughed a good old-fashioned laugh that had more of her former
natural self about it than any sound that had issued from her mouth in
many weeks. She said:</p>
<p>“You don’t change, Washington. You still begin to squander a fortune
right and left the instant you hear of it in the distance; you never
wait till the foremost dollar of it arrives within a hundred miles of
you,“ –and she kissed her brother good bye and left him weltering in his
dreams, so to speak.</p>
<p>He got up and walked the floor feverishly during two hours; and when
he sat down he had married Louise, built a house, reared a family,
married them off, spent upwards of eight hundred thousand dollars on
mere luxuries, and died worth twelve millions.</p>
