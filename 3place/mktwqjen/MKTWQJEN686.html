<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>A man may have no bad habits and have worse. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New
Calendar.</p>
<p>The starting point of this lecturing-trip around the world was Paris,
where we had been living a year or two.</p>
<p>We sailed for America, and there made certain preparations. This took
but little time. Two members of my family elected to go with me. Also a
carbuncle. The dictionary says a carbuncle is a kind of jewel. Humor is
out of place in a dictionary.</p>
<p>We started westward from New York in midsummer, with Major Pond to
manage the platform-business as far as the Pacific. It was warm work,
all the way, and the last fortnight of it was suffocatingly smoky, for
in Oregon and Columbia the forest fires were raging. We had an added
week of smoke at the seaboard, where we were obliged awhile for our
ship. She had been getting herself ashore in the smoke, and she had to
be docked and repaired.</p>
<p>We sailed at last; and so ended a snail-paced march across the
continent, which had lasted forty days.</p>
<p>We moved westward about mid-afternoon over a rippled and summer sea;
an enticing sea, a clean and cool sea, and apparently a welcome sea to
all on board; it certainly was to the distressful dustings and smokings
and swelterings of the past weeks. The voyage would furnish a
three-weeks holiday, with hardly a break in it. We had the whole Pacific
Ocean in front of us, with nothing to do but do nothing and be
comfortable. The city of Victoria was twinkling dim in the deep heart of
her smoke-cloud, and getting ready to vanish and now we closed the
field-glasses and sat down on our steamer chairs contented and at peace.
But they went to wreck and ruin under us and brought us to shame before
all the passengers. They had been furnished by the largest
furniture-dealing house in Victoria, and were worth a couple of
farthings a dozen, though they had cost us the price of honest chairs.
In the Pacific and Indian Oceans one must still bring his own deck-chair
on board or go without, just as in the old forgotten Atlantic
times–those Dark Ages of sea travel.</p>
<p>Ours was a reasonably comfortable ship, with the customary sea-going
fare –plenty of good food furnished by the Deity and cooked by the
devil. The discipline observable on board was perhaps as good as it is
anywhere in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The ship was not very well
arranged for tropical service; but that is nothing, for this is the rule
for ships which ply in the tropics. She had an over-supply of
cockroaches, but this is also the rule with ships doing business in the
summer seas–at least such as have been long in service. Our young
captain was a very handsome man, tall and perfectly formed, the very
figure to show up a smart uniform’s best effects. He was a man of the
best intentions and was polite and courteous even to courtliness. There
was a soft and finish about his manners which made whatever place he
happened to be in seem for the moment a drawing room. He avoided the
smoking room. He had no vices. He did not smoke or chew tobacco or take
snuff; he did not swear, or use slang or rude, or coarse, or indelicate
language, or make puns, or tell anecdotes, or laugh intemperately, or
raise his voice above the moderate pitch enjoined by the canons of good
form. When he gave an order, his manner modified it into a request.
After dinner he and his officers joined the ladies and gentlemen in the
ladies’ saloon, and shared in the singing and piano playing, and helped
turn the music. He had a sweet and sympathetic tenor voice, and used it
with taste and effect the music he played whist there, always with the
same partner and opponents, until the ladies’ bedtime. The electric
lights burned there as late as the ladies and their friends might
desire; but they were not allowed to burn in the smoking-room after
eleven. There were many laws on the ship’s statute book of course; but
so far as I could see, this and one other were the only ones that were
rigidly enforced. The captain explained that he enforced this one
because his own cabin adjoined the smoking-room, and the smell of
tobacco smoke made him sick. I did not see how our smoke could reach
him, for the smoking-room and his cabin were on the upper deck, targets
for all the winds that blew; and besides there was no crack of
communication between them, no opening of any sort in the solid
intervening bulkhead. Still, to a delicate stomach even imaginary smoke
can convey damage.</p>
<p>The captain, with his gentle nature, his polish, his sweetness, his
moral and verbal purity, seemed pathetically out of place in his rude
and autocratic vocation. It seemed another instance of the irony of
fate.</p>
<p>He was going home under a cloud. The passengers knew about his
trouble, and were sorry for him. Approaching Vancouver through a narrow
and difficult passage densely befogged with smoke from the forest fires,
he had had the ill-luck to lose his bearings and get his ship on the
rocks. A matter like this would rank merely as an error with you and me;
it ranks as a crime with the directors of steamship companies. The
captain had been tried by the Admiralty Court at Vancouver, and its
verdict had acquitted him of blame. But that was insufficient comfort. A
sterner court would examine the case in Sydney–the Court of Directors,
the lords of a company in whose ships the captain had served as mate a
number of years. This was his first voyage as captain.</p>
<p>The officers of our ship were hearty and companionable young men, and
they entered into the general amusements and helped the passengers pass
the time. Voyages in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are but pleasure
excursions for all hands. Our purser was a young Scotchman who was
equipped with a grit that was remarkable. He was an invalid, and looked
it, as far as his body was concerned, but illness could not subdue his
spirit. He was full of life, and had a gay and capable tongue. To all
appearances he was a sick man without being aware of it, for he did not
talk about his ailments, and his bearing and conduct were those of a
person in robust health; yet he was the prey, at intervals, of ghastly
sieges of pain in his heart. These lasted many hours, and while the
attack continued he could neither sit nor lie. In one instance he stood
on his feet twenty-four hours fighting for his life with these sharp
agonies, and yet was as full of life and cheer and activity the next day
as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>The brightest passenger in the ship, and the most interesting and
felicitous talker, was a young Canadian who was not able to let the
whisky bottle alone. He was of a rich and powerful family, and could
have had a distinguished career and abundance of effective help toward
it if he could have conquered his appetite for drink; but he could not
do it, so his great equipment of talent was of no use to him. He had
often taken the pledge to drink no more, and was a good sample of what
that sort of unwisdom can do for a man–for a man with anything short of
an iron will. The system is wrong in two ways: it does not strike at the
root of the trouble, for one thing, and to make a pledge of any kind is
to declare war against nature; for a pledge is a chain that is always
clanking and reminding the wearer of it that he is not a free man.</p>
<p>I have said that the system does not strike at the root of the
trouble, and I venture to repeat that. The root is not the drinking, but
the desire to drink. These are very different things. The one merely
requires will–and a great deal of it, both as to bulk and staying
capacity–the other merely requires watchfulness–and for no long time.
The desire of course precedes the act, and should have one’s first
attention; it can do but little good to refuse the act over and over
again, always leaving the desire unmolested, unconquered; the desire
will continue to assert itself, and will be almost sure to win in the
long run. When the desire intrudes, it should be at once banished out of
the mind. One should be on the watch for it all the time–otherwise it
will get in. It must be taken in time and not allowed to get a lodgment.
A desire constantly repulsed for a fortnight should die, then. That
should cure the drinking habit. The system of refusing the mere act of
drinking, and leaving the desire in full force, is unintelligent war
tactics, it seems to me. I used to take pledges–and soon violate them.
My will was not strong, and I could not help it. And then, to be tied in
any way naturally irks an otherwise free person and makes him chafe in
his bonds and want to get his liberty. But when I finally ceased from
taking definite pledges, and merely resolved that I would kill an
injurious desire, but leave myself free to resume the desire and the
habit whenever I should choose to do so, I had no more trouble. In five
days I drove out the desire to smoke and was not obliged to keep watch
after that; and I never experienced any strong desire to smoke again. At
the end of a year and a quarter of idleness I began to write a book, and
presently found that the pen was strangely reluctant to go. I tried a
smoke to see if that would help me out of the difficulty. It did. I
smoked eight or ten cigars and as many pipes a day for five months;
finished the book, and did not smoke again until a year had gone by and
another book had to be begun.</p>
<p>I can quit any of my nineteen injurious habits at any time, and
without discomfort or inconvenience. I think that the Dr. Tanners and
those others who go forty days without eating do it by resolutely
keeping out the desire to eat, in the beginning, and that after a few
hours the desire is discouraged and comes no more.</p>
<p>Once I tried my scheme in a large medical way. I had been confined to
my bed several days with lumbago. My case refused to improve. Finally
the doctor said,–</p>
<p>“My remedies have no fair chance. Consider what they have to fight,
besides the lumbago. You smoke extravagantly, don’t you?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“You take coffee immoderately?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And some tea?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“You eat all kinds of things that are dissatisfied with each other’s
company?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“You drink two hot Scotches every night?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Very well, there you see what I have to contend against. We can’t
make progress the way the matter stands. You must make a reduction in
these things; you must cut down your consumption of them considerably
for some days.“</p>
<p>“I can’t, doctor.“</p>
<p>“Why can’t you.“</p>
<p>“I lack the will-power. I can cut them off entirely, but I can’t
merely moderate them.“</p>
<p>He said that that would answer, and said he would come around in
twenty-four hours and begin work again. He was taken ill himself and
could not come; but I did not need him. I cut off all those things for
two days and nights; in fact, I cut off all kinds of food, too, and all
drinks except water, and at the end of the forty-eight hours the lumbago
was discouraged and left me. I was a well man; so I gave thanks and took
to those delicacies again.</p>
<p>It seemed a valuable medical course, and I recommended it to a lady.
She had run down and down and down, and had at last reached a point
where medicines no longer had any helpful effect upon her. I said I knew
I could put her upon her feet in a week. It brightened her up, it filled
her with hope, and she said she would do everything I told her to do. So
I said she must stop swearing and drinking, and smoking and eating for
four days, and then she would be all right again. And it would have
happened just so, I know it; but she said she could not stop swearing,
and smoking, and drinking, because she had never done those things. So
there it was. She had neglected her habits, and hadn’t any. Now that
they would have come good, there were none in stock. She had nothing to
fall back on. She was a sinking vessel, with no freight in her to throw
over lighten ship withal. Why, even one or two little bad habits could
have saved her, but she was just a moral pauper. When she could have
acquired them she was dissuaded by her parents, who were ignorant people
though reared in the best society, and it was too late to begin now. It
seemed such a pity; but there was no help for it. These things ought to
be attended to while a person is young; otherwise, when age and disease
come, there is nothing effectual to fight them with.</p>
<p>When I was a youth I used to take all kinds of pledges, and do my
best to keep them, but I never could, because I didn’t strike at the
root of the habit–the desire; I generally broke down within the month.
Once I tried limiting a habit. That worked tolerably well for a while. I
pledged myself to smoke but one cigar a day. I kept the cigar waiting
until bedtime, then I had a luxurious time with it. But desire
persecuted me every day and all day long; so, within the week I found
myself hunting for larger cigars than I had been used to smoke; then
larger ones still, and still larger ones. Within the fortnight I was
getting cigars made for me–on a yet larger pattern. They still grew and
grew in size. Within the month my cigar had grown to such proportions
that I could have used it as a crutch. It now seemed to me that a
one-cigar limit was no real protection to a person, so I knocked my
pledge on the head and resumed my liberty.</p>
<p>To go back to that young Canadian. He was a “remittance man,“ the
first one I had ever seen or heard of. Passengers explained the term to
me. They said that dissipated ne’er-do-wells belonging to important
families in England and Canada were not cast off by their people while
there was any hope of reforming them, but when that last hope perished
at last, the ne’er-do-well was sent abroad to get him out of the way. He
was shipped off with just enough money in his pocket–no, in the purser’s
pocket–for the needs of the voyage–and when he reached his destined port
he would find a remittance awaiting him there. Not a large one, but just
enough to keep him a month. A similar remittance would come monthly
thereafter. It was the remittance-man’s custom to pay his month’s board
and lodging straightway–a duty which his landlord did not allow him to
forget–then spree away the rest of his money in a single night, then
brood and mope and grieve in idleness till the next remittance came. It
is a pathetic life.</p>
<p>We had other remittance-men on board, it was said. At least they said
they were R. M.’s. There were two. But they did not resemble the
Canadian; they lacked his tidiness, and his brains, and his gentlemanly
ways, and his resolute spirit, and his humanities and generosities. One
of them was a lad of nineteen or twenty, and he was a good deal of a
ruin, as to clothes, and morals, and general aspect. He said he was a
scion of a ducal house in England, and had been shipped to Canada for
the house’s relief, that he had fallen into trouble there, and was now
being shipped to Australia. He said he had no title. Beyond this remark
he was economical of the truth. The first thing he did in Australia was
to get into the lockup, and the next thing he did was to proclaim
himself an earl in the police court in the morning and fail to prove
it.</p>
