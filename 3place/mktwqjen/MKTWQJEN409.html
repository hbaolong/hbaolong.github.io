<h4 id="chapter-26-under-fire">Chapter 26 Under Fire</h4>
<p>TALK began to run upon the war now, for we were getting down into the
upper edge of the former battle-stretch by this time. Columbus was just
behind us, so there was a good deal said about the famous battle of
Belmont. Several of the boat’s officers had seen active service in the
Mississippi war-fleet. I gathered that they found themselves sadly out
of their element in that kind of business at first, but afterward got
accustomed to it, reconciled to it, and more or less at home in it. One
of our pilots had his first war experience in the Belmont fight, as a
pilot on a boat in the Confederate service. I had often had a curiosity
to know how a green hand might feel, in his maiden battle, perched all
solitary and alone on high in a pilot house, a target for Tom, Dick and
Harry, and nobody at his elbow to shame him from showing the white
feather when matters grew hot and perilous around him; so, to me his
story was valuable–it filled a gap for me which all histories had left
till that time empty.</p>
<p>THE PILOT’S FIRST BATTLE</p>
<p>He said–</p>
<p>It was the 7th of November. The fight began at seven in the morning.
I was on the ‘R. H. W. Hill.’ Took over a load of troops from Columbus.
Came back, and took over a battery of artillery. My partner said he was
going to see the fight; wanted me to go along. I said, no, I wasn’t
anxious, I would look at it from the pilot-house. He said I was a
coward, and left.</p>
<p>That fight was an awful sight. General Cheatham made his men strip
their coats off and throw them in a pile, and said, ‘Now follow me to
hell or victory!’ I heard him say that from the pilot-house; and then he
galloped in, at the head of his troops. Old General Pillow, with his
white hair, mounted on a white horse, sailed in, too, leading his troops
as lively as a boy. By and by the Federals chased the rebels back, and
here they came! tearing along, everybody for himself and Devil take the
hindmost! and down under the bank they scrambled, and took shelter. I
was sitting with my legs hanging out of the pilot-house window. All at
once I noticed a whizzing sound passing my ear. Judged it was a bullet.
I didn’t stop to think about anything, I just tilted over backwards and
landed on the floor, and staid there. The balls came booming around.
Three cannon-balls went through the chimney; one ball took off the
corner of the pilot-house; shells were screaming and bursting all
around. Mighty warm times–I wished I hadn’t come. I lay there on the
pilot-house floor, while the shots came faster and faster. I crept in
behind the big stove, in the middle of the pilot-house. Presently a
minie-ball came through the stove, and just grazed my head, and cut my
hat. I judged it was time to go away from there. The captain was on the
roof with a red-headed major from Memphis–a fine-looking man. I heard
him say he wanted to leave here, but ‘that pilot is killed.’ I crept
over to the starboard side to pull the bell to set her back; raised up
and took a look, and I saw about fifteen shot holes through the window
panes; had come so lively I hadn’t noticed them. I glanced out on the
water, and the spattering shot were like a hailstorm. I thought best to
get out of that place. I went down the pilot-house guy, head first–not
feet first but head first–slid down–before I struck the deck, the
captain said we must leave there. So I climbed up the guy and got on the
floor again. About that time, they collared my partner and were bringing
him up to the pilot-house between two soldiers. Somebody had said I was
killed. He put his head in and saw me on the floor reaching for the
backing bells. He said, ‘Oh, hell, he ain’t shot,’ and jerked away from
the men who had him by the collar, and ran below. We were there until
three o’clock in the afternoon, and then got away all right.</p>
<p>The next time I saw my partner, I said, ‘Now, come out, be honest,
and tell me the truth. Where did you go when you went to see that
battle?’ He says, ‘I went down in the hold.’</p>
<p>All through that fight I was scared nearly to death. I hardly knew
anything, I was so frightened; but you see, nobody knew that but me.
Next day General Polk sent for me, and praised me for my bravery and
gallant conduct. I never said anything, I let it go at that. I judged it
wasn’t so, but it was not for me to contradict a general officer.</p>
<p>Pretty soon after that I was sick, and used up, and had to go off to
the Hot Springs. When there, I got a good many letters from commanders
saying they wanted me to come back. I declined, because I wasn’t well
enough or strong enough; but I kept still, and kept the reputation I had
made.</p>
<p>A plain story, straightforwardly told; but Mumford told me that that
pilot had ‘gilded that scare of his, in spots;’ that his subsequent
career in the war was proof of it.</p>
<p>We struck down through the chute of Island No. 8, and I went below
and fell into conversation with a passenger, a handsome man, with easy
carriage and an intelligent face. We were approaching Island No. 10, a
place so celebrated during the war. This gentleman’s home was on the
main shore in its neighborhood. I had some talk with him about the war
times; but presently the discourse fell upon ‘feuds,’ for in no part of
the South has the vendetta flourished more briskly, or held out longer
between warring families, than in this particular region. This gentleman
said–</p>
<p>‘There’s been more than one feud around here, in old times, but I
reckon the worst one was between the Darnells and the Watsons. Nobody
don’t know now what the first quarrel was about, it’s so long ago; the
Darnells and the Watsons don’t know, if there’s any of them living,
which I don’t think there is. Some says it was about a horse or a cow–
anyway, it was a little matter; the money in it wasn’t of no
consequence–none in the world–both families was rich. The thing could
have been fixed up, easy enough; but no, that wouldn’t do. Rough words
had been passed; and so, nothing but blood could fix it up after that.
That horse or cow, whichever it was, cost sixty years of killing and
crippling! Every year or so somebody was shot, on one side or the other;
and as fast as one generation was laid out, their sons took up the feud
and kept it a-going. And it’s just as I say; they went on shooting each
other, year in and year out–making a kind of a religion of it, you see
–till they’d done forgot, long ago, what it was all about. Wherever a
Darnell caught a Watson, or a Watson caught a Darnell, one of ’em was
going to get hurt–only question was, which of them got the drop on the
other. They’d shoot one another down, right in the presence of the
family. They didn’t hunt for each other, but when they happened to meet,
they puffed and begun. Men would shoot boys, boys would shoot men. A man
shot a boy twelve years old–happened on him in the woods, and didn’t
give him no chance. If he HAD ’a’ given him a chance, the boy’d ‘a’ shot
him. Both families belonged to the same church (everybody around here is
religious); through all this fifty or sixty years’ fuss, both tribes was
there every Sunday, to worship. They lived each side of the line, and
the church was at a landing called Compromise. Half the church and half
the aisle was in Kentucky, the other half in Tennessee. Sundays you’d
see the families drive up, all in their Sunday clothes, men, women, and
children, and file up the aisle, and set down, quiet and orderly, one
lot on the Tennessee side of the church and the other on the Kentucky
side; and the men and boys would lean their guns up against the wall,
handy, and then all hands would join in with the prayer and praise;
though they say the man next the aisle didn’t kneel down, along with the
rest of the family; kind of stood guard. I don’t know; never was at that
church in my life; but I remember that that’s what used to be said.</p>
<p>’Twenty or twenty-five years ago, one of the feud families caught a
young man of nineteen out and killed him. Don’t remember whether it was
the Darnells and Watsons, or one of the other feuds; but anyway, this
young man rode up–steamboat laying there at the time–and the first thing
he saw was a whole gang of the enemy. He jumped down behind a wood-pile,
but they rode around and begun on him, he firing back, and they
galloping and cavorting and yelling and banging away with all their
might. Think he wounded a couple of them; but they closed in on him and
chased him into the river; and as he swum along down stream, they
followed along the bank and kept on shooting at him; and when he struck
shore he was dead. Windy Marshall told me about it. He saw it. He was
captain of the boat.</p>
<p>‘Years ago, the Darnells was so thinned out that the old man and his
two sons concluded they’d leave the country. They started to take
steamboat just above No. 10; but the Watsons got wind of it; and they
arrived just as the two young Darnells was walking up the companion-way
with their wives on their arms. The fight begun then, and they never got
no further–both of them killed. After that, old Darnell got into trouble
with the man that run the ferry, and the ferry-man got the worst of it–
and died. But his friends shot old Darnell through and through–filled
him full of bullets, and ended him.’</p>
<p>The country gentleman who told me these things had been reared in
ease and comfort, was a man of good parts, and was college bred. His
loose grammar was the fruit of careless habit, not ignorance. This habit
among educated men in the West is not universal, but it is prevalent–
prevalent in the towns, certainly, if not in the cities; and to a degree
which one cannot help noticing, and marveling at. I heard a Westerner
who would be accounted a highly educated man in any country, say ‘never
mind, it DON’T MAKE NO DIFFERENCE, anyway.’ A life-long resident who was
present heard it, but it made no impression upon her. She was able to
recall the fact afterward, when reminded of it; but she confessed that
the words had not grated upon her ear at the time–a confession which
suggests that if educated people can hear such blasphemous grammar, from
such a source, and be unconscious of the deed, the crime must be
tolerably common–so common that the general ear has become dulled by
familiarity with it, and is no longer alert, no longer sensitive to such
affronts.</p>
<p>No one in the world speaks blemishless grammar; no one has ever
written it–NO one, either in the world or out of it (taking the
Scriptures for evidence on the latter point); therefore it would not be
fair to exact grammatical perfection from the peoples of the Valley; but
they and all other peoples may justly be required to refrain from
KNOWINGLY and PURPOSELY debauching their grammar.</p>
<p>I found the river greatly changed at Island No. 10. The island which
I remembered was some three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide,
heavily timbered, and lay near the Kentucky shore–within two hundred
yards of it, I should say. Now, however, one had to hunt for it with a
spy-glass. Nothing was left of it but an insignificant little tuft, and
this was no longer near the Kentucky shore; it was clear over against
the opposite shore, a mile away. In war times the island had been an
important place, for it commanded the situation; and, being heavily
fortified, there was no getting by it. It lay between the upper and
lower divisions of the Union forces, and kept them separate, until a
junction was finally effected across the Missouri neck of land; but the
island being itself joined to that neck now, the wide river is without
obstruction.</p>
<p>In this region the river passes from Kentucky into Tennessee, back
into Missouri, then back into Kentucky, and thence into Tennessee again.
So a mile or two of Missouri sticks over into Tennessee.</p>
<p>The town of New Madrid was looking very unwell; but otherwise
unchanged from its former condition and aspect. Its blocks of
frame-houses were still grouped in the same old flat plain, and
environed by the same old forests. It was as tranquil as formerly, and
apparently had neither grown nor diminished in size. It was said that
the recent high water had invaded it and damaged its looks. This was
surprising news; for in low water the river bank is very high there
(fifty feet), and in my day an overflow had always been considered an
impossibility. This present flood of 1882 Will doubtless be celebrated
in the river’s history for several generations before a deluge of like
magnitude shall be seen. It put all the unprotected low lands under
water, from Cairo to the mouth; it broke down the levees in a great many
places, on both sides of the river; and in some regions south, when the
flood was at its highest, the Mississippi was SEVENTY MILES wide! a
number of lives were lost, and the destruction of property was fearful.
The crops were destroyed, houses washed away, and shelterless men and
cattle forced to take refuge on scattering elevations here and there in
field and forest, and wait in peril and suffering until the boats put in
commission by the national and local governments and by newspaper
enterprise could come and rescue them. The properties of multitudes of
people were under water for months, and the poorer ones must have
starved by the hundred if succor had not been promptly
afforded.{footnote [For a detailed and interesting description of the
great flood, written on board of the New Orleans TIMES-DEMOCRAT’S
relief-boat, see Appendix A]} The water had been falling during a
considerable time now, yet as a rule we found the banks still under
water.</p>
