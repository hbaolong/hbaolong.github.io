<h4 id="chapter-xxxvi.">CHAPTER XXXVI.</h4>
<p>We have got so far east, now–a hundred and fifty-five degrees of
longitude from San Francisco–that my watch can not “keep the hang“ of
the time any more. It has grown discouraged, and stopped. I think it did
a wise thing. The difference in time between Sebastopol and the Pacific
coast is enormous. When it is six o’clock in the morning here, it is
somewhere about week before last in California. We are excusable for
getting a little tangled as to time. These distractions and distresses
about the time have worried me so much that I was afraid my mind was so
much affected that I never would have any appreciation of time again;
but when I noticed how handy I was yet about comprehending when it was
dinner-time, a blessed tranquillity settled down upon me, and I am
tortured with doubts and fears no more.</p>
<p>Odessa is about twenty hours’ run from Sebastopol, and is the most
northerly port in the Black Sea. We came here to get coal, principally.
The city has a population of one hundred and thirty-three thousand, and
is growing faster than any other small city out of America. It is a free
port, and is the great grain mart of this particular part of the world.
Its roadstead is full of ships. Engineers are at work, now, turning the
open roadstead into a spacious artificial harbor. It is to be almost
inclosed by massive stone piers, one of which will extend into the sea
over three thousand feet in a straight line.</p>
<p>I have not felt so much at home for a long time as I did when I
“raised the hill“ and stood in Odessa for the first time. It looked just
like an American city; fine, broad streets, and straight as well; low
houses, (two or three stories,) wide, neat, and free from any quaintness
of architectural ornamentation; locust trees bordering the sidewalks
(they call them acacias;) a stirring, business-look about the streets
and the stores; fast walkers; a familiar new look about the houses and
every thing; yea, and a driving and smothering cloud of dust that was so
like a message from our own dear native land that we could hardly
refrain from shedding a few grateful tears and execrations in the old
time-honored American way. Look up the street or down the street, this
way or that way, we saw only America! There was not one thing to remind
us that we were in Russia. We walked for some little distance, reveling
in this home vision, and then we came upon a church and a hack-driver,
and presto! the illusion vanished! The church had a slender-spired dome
that rounded inward at its base, and looked like a turnip turned upside
down, and the hackman seemed to be dressed in a long petticoat with out
any hoops. These things were essentially foreign, and so were the
carriages –but every body knows about these things, and there is no
occasion for my describing them.</p>
<p>We were only to stay here a day and a night and take in coal; we
consulted the guide-books and were rejoiced to know that there were no
sights in Odessa to see; and so we had one good, untrammeled holyday on
our hands, with nothing to do but idle about the city and enjoy
ourselves. We sauntered through the markets and criticised the fearful
and wonderful costumes from the back country; examined the populace as
far as eyes could do it; and closed the entertainment with an ice-cream
debauch. We do not get ice-cream every where, and so, when we do, we are
apt to dissipate to excess. We never cared any thing about ice-cream at
home, but we look upon it with a sort of idolatry now that it is so
scarce in these red-hot climates of the East.</p>
<p>We only found two pieces of statuary, and this was another blessing.
One was a bronze image of the Duc de Richelieu, grand-nephew of the
splendid Cardinal. It stood in a spacious, handsome promenade,
overlooking the sea, and from its base a vast flight of stone steps led
down to the harbor–two hundred of them, fifty feet long, and a wide
landing at the bottom of every twenty. It is a noble staircase, and from
a distance the people toiling up it looked like insects. I mention this
statue and this stairway because they have their story. Richelieu
founded Odessa –watched over it with paternal care–labored with a
fertile brain and a wise understanding for its best interests–spent his
fortune freely to the same end–endowed it with a sound prosperity, and
one which will yet make it one of the great cities of the Old
World–built this noble stairway with money from his own private
purse–and–. Well, the people for whom he had done so much, let him walk
down these same steps, one day, unattended, old, poor, without a second
coat to his back; and when, years afterwards, he died in Sebastopol in
poverty and neglect, they called a meeting, subscribed liberally, and
immediately erected this tasteful monument to his memory, and named a
great street after him. It reminds me of what Robert Burns’ mother said
when they erected a stately monument to his memory: “Ah, Robbie, ye
asked them for bread and they hae gi’en ye a stane.“</p>
<p>The people of Odessa have warmly recommended us to go and call on the
Emperor, as did the Sebastopolians. They have telegraphed his Majesty,
and he has signified his willingness to grant us an audience. So we are
getting up the anchors and preparing to sail to his watering-place. What
a scratching around there will be, now! what a holding of important
meetings and appointing of solemn committees!–and what a furbishing up
of claw-hammer coats and white silk neck-ties! As this fearful ordeal we
are about to pass through pictures itself to my fancy in all its dread
sublimity, I begin to feel my fierce desire to converse with a genuine
Emperor cooling down and passing away. What am I to do with my hands?
What am I to do with my feet? What in the world am I to do with
myself?</p>
