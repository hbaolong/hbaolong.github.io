SHEKELS</h4>
<p>“Did you do as I told you? Did you look up the Mexican Plug?“</p>
<p>“Yes, I made his acquaintance before night and got his
friendship.“</p>
<p>“I liked him. Did you?“</p>
<p>“Not at first. He took me for a reptile, and it troubled me, because
I didn’t know whether it was a compliment or not. I couldn’t ask him,
because it would look ignorant. So I didn’t say anything, and soon liked
him very well indeed. Was it a compliment, do you think?“</p>
<p>“Yes, that is what it was. They are very rare, the reptiles; very few
left, now-a-days.“</p>
<p>“Is that so? What is a reptile?“</p>
<p>“It is a plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium that hasn’t any
wings and is uncertain.“</p>
<p>“Well, it–it sounds fine, it surely does.“</p>
<p>“And it IS fine. You may be thankful you are one.“</p>
<p>“I am. It seems wonderfully grand and elegant for a person that is so
humble as I am; but I am thankful, I am indeed, and will try to live up
to it. It is hard to remember. Will you say it again, please, and say it
slow?“</p>
<p>“Plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium that hasn’t any wings
and is uncertain.“</p>
<p>“It is beautiful, anybody must grant it; beautiful, and of a noble
sound. I hope it will not make me proud and stuck-up–I should not like
to be that. It is much more distinguished and honorable to be a reptile
than a dog, don’t you think, Soldier?“</p>
<p>“Why, there’s no comparison. It is awfully aristocratic. Often a duke
is called a reptile; it is set down so, in history.“</p>
<p>“Isn’t that grand! Potter wouldn’t ever associate with me, but I
reckon he’ll be glad to when he finds out what I am.“</p>
<p>“You can depend upon it.“</p>
<p>“I will thank Mongrel for this. He is a very good sort, for a Mexican
Plug. Don’t you think he is?“</p>
<p>“It is my opinion of him; and as for his birth, he cannot help that.
We cannot all be reptiles, we cannot all be fossils; we have to take
what comes and be thankful it is no worse. It is the true
philosophy.“</p>
<p>“For those others?“</p>
<p>“Stick to the subject, please. Did it turn out that my suspicions
were right?“</p>
<p>“Yes, perfectly right. Mongrel has heard them planning. They are
after BB’s life, for running them out of Medicine Bow and taking their
stolen horses away from them.“</p>
<p>“Well, they’ll get him yet, for sure.“</p>
<p>“Not if he keeps a sharp look-out.“</p>
<p>“HE keep a sharp lookout! He never does; he despises them, and all
their kind. His life is always being threatened, and so it has come to
be monotonous.“</p>
<p>“Does he know they are here?“</p>
<p>“Oh yes, he knows it. He is always the earliest to know who comes and
who goes. But he cares nothing for them and their threats; he only
laughs when people warn him. They’ll shoot him from behind a tree the
first he knows. Did Mongrel tell you their plans?“</p>
<p>“Yes. They have found out that he starts for Fort Clayton day after
to-morrow, with one of his scouts; so they will leave to-morrow, letting
on to go south, but they will fetch around north all in good time.“</p>
<p>“Shekels, I don’t like the look of it.“</p>
