OF 1901, CHIEFLY TO TWICHELL. MARK TWAIN AS A REFORMER. SUMMER AT
SARANAC. ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT McKINLEY</h4>
<p>An editorial in the Louisville Courier-Journal, early in 1901, said:
“A remarkable transformation, or rather a development, has taken place
in Mark Twain. The genial humorist of the earlier day is now a reformer
of the vigorous kind, a sort of knight errant who does not hesitate to
break a lance with either Church or State if he thinks them interposing
on that broad highway over which he believes not a part but the whole of
mankind has the privilege of passing in the onward march of the
ages.“</p>
<p>Mark Twain had begun “breaking the lance“ very soon after his return
from Europe. He did not believe that he could reform the world, but at
least he need not withhold his protest against those things which
stirred his wrath. He began by causing the arrest of a cabman who had
not only overcharged but insulted him; he continued by writing openly
against the American policy in the Philippines, the missionary
propaganda which had resulted in the Chinese uprising and massacre, and
against Tammany politics. Not all of his efforts were in the line of
reform; he had become a sort of general spokesman which the public
flocked to hear, whatever the subject. On the occasion of a Lincoln
Birthday service at Carnegie Hall he was chosen to preside, and he was
obliged to attend more dinners than were good for his health. His
letters of this period were mainly written to his old friend Twichell,
in Hartford. Howells, who lived in New York, he saw with considerable
frequency.</p>
<p>In the letter which follows the medicine which Twichell was to take
was Plasmon, an English proprietary remedy in which Mark Twain had
invested–a panacea for all human ills which osteopathy could not
reach.</p>
<p>To Rev. Joseph Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>14 W. 10TH ST. Jan. 23, ’01. DEAR JOE,–Certainly. I used to take it
in my coffee, but it settled to the bottom in the form of mud, and I had
to eat it with a spoon; so I dropped the custom and took my 2
teaspoonfuls in cold milk after breakfast. If we were out of milk I
shoveled the dry powder into my mouth and washed it down with water. The
only essential is to get it down, the method is not important.</p>
<p>No, blame it, I can’t go to the Alumni dinner, Joe. It takes two
days, and I can’t spare the time. Moreover I preside at the Lincoln
birthday celebration in Carnegie Hall Feb. 11 and I must not make two
speeches so close together. Think of it–two old rebels functioning
there–I as President, and Watterson as Orator of the Day! Things have
changed somewhat in these 40 years, thank God.</p>
<p>Look here–when you come down you must be our guest–we’ve got a roomy
room for you, and Livy will make trouble if you go elsewhere. Come
straight to 14 West 10th.</p>
<p>Jan. 24. Livy says Amen to that; also, can you give us a day or two’s
notice, so the room will be sure to be vacant?</p>
<p>I’m going to stick close to my desk for a month, now, hoping to write
a small book. Ys Ever MARK</p>
<p>The letter which follows is a fair sample of Mark Twain’s private
violence on a subject which, in public print, he could only treat
effectively by preserving his good humor. When he found it necessary to
boil over, as he did, now and then, for relief, he always found a
willing audience in Twichell. The mention of his “Private Philosophy“
refers to ‘What Is Man?’, privately published in 1906; reissued by his
publishers in 1916.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>14 W. 10th Jan. 29, ’01. DEAR JOE,–I’m not expecting anything but
kicks for scoffing, and am expecting a diminution of my bread and butter
by it, but if Livy will let me I will have my say. This nation is like
all the others that have been spewed upon the earth–ready to shout for
any cause that will tickle its vanity or fill its pocket. What a hell of
a heaven it will be, when they get all these hypocrites assembled
there!</p>
<p>I can’t understand it! You are a public guide and teacher, Joe, and
are under a heavy responsibility to men, young and old; if you teach
your people–as you teach me–to hide their opinions when they believe the
flag is being abused and dishonored, lest the utterance do them and a
publisher a damage, how do you answer for it to your conscience? You are
sorry for me; in the fair way of give and take, I am willing to be a
little sorry for you.</p>
<p>However, I seem to be going counter to my own Private
Philosophy–which Livy won’t allow me to publish–because it would destroy
me. But I hope to see it in print before I die. I planned it 15 years
ago, and wrote it in ’98. I’ve often tried to read it to Livy, but she
won’t have it; it makes her melancholy. The truth always has that effect
on people. Would have, anyway, if they ever got hold of a rag of
it–Which they don’t.</p>
<p>You are supposing that I am supposing that I am moved by a Large
Patriotism, and that I am distressed because our President has blundered
up to his neck in the Philippine mess; and that I am grieved because
this great big ignorant nation, which doesn’t know even the A B C facts
of the Philippine episode, is in disgrace before the sarcastic
world–drop that idea! I care nothing for the rest–I am only distressed
and troubled because I am befouled by these things. That is all. When I
search myself away down deep, I find this out. Whatever a man feels or
thinks or does, there is never any but one reason for it–and that is a
selfish one.</p>
<p>At great inconvenience, and expense of precious time I went to the
chief synagogue the other night and talked in the interest of a charity
school of poor Jew girls. I know–to the finest, shades–the selfish ends
that moved me; but no one else suspects. I could give you the details if
I had time. You would perceive how true they are.</p>
<p>I’ve written another article; you better hurry down and help Livy
squelch it.</p>
<p>She’s out pottering around somewhere, poor housekeeping slave; and
Clara is in the hands of the osteopath, getting the bronchitis pulled
and hauled out of her. It was a bad attack, and a little disquieting. It
came day before yesterday, and she hasn’t sat up till this afternoon.
She is getting along satisfactorily, now. Lots of love to you all.
MARK</p>
<p>Mark Twain’s religion had to do chiefly with humanity in its present
incarnation, and concerned itself very little with any possible measure
of reward or punishment in some supposed court of the hereafter.
Nevertheless, psychic investigation always interested him, and he was
good-naturedly willing to explore, even hoping, perhaps, to be convinced
that individuality continues beyond death. The letter which follows
indicates his customary attitude in relation to spiritualistic research.
The experiments here mentioned, however, were not satisfactory.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Charles McQuiston:</p>
<p>DOBBS FERRY, N. Y. March 26, 1901. DEAR MRS. McQUISTON,–I have never
had an experience which moved me to believe the living can communicate
with the dead, but my wife and I have experimented in the matter when
opportunity offered and shall continue to do so.</p>
<p>I enclose a letter which came this morning–the second from the same
source. Mrs. K—-is a Missourian, and lately she discovered, by accident,
that she was a remarkable hypnotiser. Her best subject is a Missouri
girl, Miss White, who is to come here soon and sustain strictly
scientific tests before professors at Columbia University. Mrs. Clemens
and I intend to be present. And we shall ask the pair to come to our
house to do whatever things they can do. Meantime, if you thought well
of it, you might write her and arrange a meeting, telling her it is by
my suggestion and that I gave you her address.</p>
<p>Someone has told me that Mrs. Piper is discredited. I cannot be sure,
but I think it was Mr. Myers, President of the London Psychical Research
Society–we heard of his death yesterday. He was a spiritualist. I am
afraid he was a very easily convinced man. We visited two mediums whom
he and Andrew Lang considered quite wonderful, but they were quite
transparent frauds.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens corrects me: One of those women was a fraud, the other
not a fraud, but only an innocent, well-meaning, driveling vacancy.
Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>In Mark Twain’s Bermuda chapters entitled Idle Notes of an Idle
Excursion he tells of an old sea captain, one Hurricane Jones, who
explained biblical miracles in a practical, even if somewhat startling,
fashion. In his story of the prophets of Baal, for instance, the old
captain declared that the burning water was nothing more nor less than
petroleum. Upon reading the “notes,“ Professor Phelps of Yale wrote that
the same method of explaining miracles had been offered by Sir Thomas
Browne.</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be added that Captain Hurricane Jones also appears in
Roughing It, as Captain Ned Blakely.</p>
<p>To Professor William Lyon Phelps;</p>
<p>YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK, April 24, 1901. MY DEAR SIR,–I was not
aware that old Sir Thomas had anticipated that story, and I am much
obliged to you for furnishing me the paragraph. t is curious that the
same idea should leave entered two heads so unlike as the head of that
wise old philosopher and that of Captain Ned Wakeman, a splendidly
uncultured old sailor, but in his own opinion a thinker by divine right.
He was an old friend of mine of many years’ standing; I made two or
three voyages with him, and found him a darling in many ways. The
petroleum story was not told to me; he told it to Joe Twichell, who ran
across him by accident on a sea voyage where I think the two were the
only passengers. A delicious pair, and admirably mated, they took to
each other at once and became as thick as thieves. Joe was passing under
a fictitious name, and old Wakeman didn’t suspect that he was a parson;
so he gave his profanity full swing, and he was a master of that great
art. You probably know Twichell, and will know that that is a kind of
refreshment which he is very capable of enjoying. Sincerely yours, S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>For the summer Clemens and his family found a comfortable lodge in
the Adirondacks–a log cabin called “The Lair“–on Saranac Lake. Soon
after his arrival there he received an invitation to attend the
celebration of Missouri’s eightieth anniversary. He sent the following
letter:</p>
<p>To Edward L. Dimmitt, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>AMONG THE ADIRONDACK LAKES, July 19, 1901. DEAR MR. DIMMITT,–By an
error in the plans, things go wrong end first in this world, and much
precious time is lost and matters of urgent importance are fatally
retarded. Invitations which a brisk young fellow should get, and which
would transport him with joy, are delayed and impeded and obstructed
until they are fifty years overdue when they reach him.</p>
<p>It has happened again in this case.</p>
<p>When I was a boy in Missouri I was always on the lookout for
invitations but they always miscarried and went wandering through the
aisles of time; and now they are arriving when I am old and rheumatic
and can’t travel and must lose my chance.</p>
<p>I have lost a world of delight through this matter of delaying
invitations. Fifty years ago I would have gone eagerly across the world
to help celebrate anything that might turn up. IT would have made no
difference to me what it was, so that I was there and allowed a chance
to make a noise.</p>
<p>The whole scheme of things is turned wrong end to. Life should begin
with age and its privileges and accumulations, and end with youth and
its capacity to splendidly enjoy such advantages. As things are now,
when in youth a dollar would bring a hundred pleasures, you can’t have
it. When you are old, you get it and there is nothing worth buying with
it then.</p>
<p>It’s an epitome of life. The first half of it consists of the
capacity to enjoy without the chance; the last half consists of the
chance without the capacity.</p>
<p>I am admonished in many ways that time is pushing me inexorably
along. I am approaching the threshold of age; in 1977 I shall be 142.
This is no time to be flitting about the earth. I must cease from the
activities proper to youth and begin to take on the dignities and
gravities and inertia proper to that season of honorable senility which
is on its way and imminent as indicated above.</p>
<p>Yours is a great and memorable occasion, and as a son of Missouri I
should hold it a high privilege to be there and share your just pride in
the state’s achievements; but I must deny myself the indulgence, while
thanking you earnestly for the prized honor you have done me in asking
me to be present. Very truly yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>In the foregoing Mark Twain touches upon one of his favorite fancies:
that life should begin with old age and approach strong manhood, golden
youth, to end at last with pampered and beloved babyhood. Possibly he
contemplated writing a story with this idea as the theme, but He seems
never to have done so.</p>
<p>The reader who has followed these letters may remember Yung Wing, who
had charge of the Chinese educational mission in Hartford, and how Mark
Twain, with Twichell, called on General Grant in behalf of the mission.
Yung Wing, now returned to China, had conceived the idea of making an
appeal to the Government of the United States for relief of his starving
countrymen.</p>
<p>To J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>AMPERSAND, N. Y., July 28, ’01. DEAR JOE,–As you say, it is
impracticable–in my case, certainly. For me to assist in an appeal to
that Congress of land-thieves and liars would be to bring derision upon
it; and for me to assist in an appeal for cash to pass through the hands
of those missionaries out there, of any denomination, Catholic or
Protestant, wouldn’t do at all. They wouldn’t handle money which I had
soiled, and I wouldn’t trust them with it, anyway. They would devote it
to the relief of suffering–I know that–but the sufferers selected would
be converts. The missionary-utterances exhibit no humane feeling toward
the others, but in place of it a spirit of hate and hostility. And it is
natural; the Bible forbids their presence there, their trade is
unlawful, why shouldn’t their characters be of necessity in harmony
with–but never mind, let it go, it irritates me.</p>
<p>Later…. I have been reading Yung Wing’s letter again. It may be that
he is over-wrought by his sympathies, but it may not be so. There may be
other reasons why the missionaries are silent about the Shensi-2-year
famine and cannibalism. It may be that there are so few Protestant
converts there that the missionaries are able to take care of them. That
they are not likely to largely concern themselves about Catholic
converts and the others, is quite natural, I think.</p>
<p>That crude way of appealing to this Government for help in a cause
which has no money in it, and no politics, rises before me again in all
its admirable innocence! Doesn’t Yung Wing know us yet? However, he has
been absent since ’96 or ’97. We have gone to hell since then. Kossuth
couldn’t raise 30 cents in Congress, now, if he were back with his
moving Magyar-Tale.</p>
<p>I am on the front porch (lower one–main deck) of our little bijou of
a dwelling-house. The lake-edge (Lower Saranac) is so nearly under me
that I can’t see the shore, but only the water, small-pored with
rain-splashes–for there is a heavy down-pour. It is charmingly like
sitting snuggled up on a ship’s deck with the stretching sea all around
–but very much more satisfactory, for at sea a rain-storm is depressing,
while here of course the effect engendered is just a deep sense of
comfort and contentment. The heavy forest shuts us solidly in on three
sides there are no neighbors. There are beautiful little tan-colored
impudent squirrels about. They take tea, 5 p. m., (not invited) at the
table in the woods where Jean does my typewriting, and one of them has
been brave enough to sit upon Jean’s knee with his tail curved over his
back and munch his food. They come to dinner, 7 p. m., on the front
porch (not invited). They all have the one name–Blennerhasset, from
Burr’s friend–and none of them answers to it except when hungry.</p>
<p>We have been here since June 21st. For a little while we had some
warm days–according to the family’s estimate; I was hardly discommoded
myself. Otherwise the weather has been of the sort you are familiar with
in these regions: cool days and cool nights. We have heard of the hot
wave every Wednesday, per the weekly paper–we allow no dailies to
intrude. Last week through visitors also–the only ones we have had
–Dr. Root and John Howells.</p>
<p>We have the daily lake-swim; and all the tribe, servants included
(but not I) do a good deal of boating; sometimes with the guide,
sometimes without him–Jean and Clara are competent with the oars. If we
live another year, I hope we shall spend its summer in this house.</p>
<p>We have taken the Appleton country seat, overlooking the Hudson, at
Riverdale, 25 minutes from the Grand Central Station, for a year,
beginning Oct. 1, with option for another year. We are obliged to be
close to New York for a year or two.</p>
<p>Aug. 3rd. I go yachting a fortnight up north in a 20-knot boat 225
feet long, with the owner, (Mr. Rogers), Tom Reid, Dr. Rice, Col. A. G.
Paine and one or two others. Judge Howland would go, but can’t get away
from engagements; Professor Sloane would go, but is in the grip of an
illness. Come–will you go? If you can manage it, drop a post-card to me
c/o H.H. Rogers, 26 Broadway. I shall be in New York a couple of days
before we sail–July 31 or Aug. 1, perhaps the latter,–and I think I
shall stop at the Hotel Grosvenor, cor. 10th St and 5th ave.</p>
<p>We all send you and the Harmonies lots and gobs of love. MARK</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>AMPERSAND, N. Y., Aug. 28. DEAR JOE,–Just a word, to scoff at you,
with your extravagant suggestion that I read the biography of Phillips
Brooks–the very dullest book that has been printed for a century. Joe,
ten pages of Mrs. Cheney’s masterly biography of her fathers–no, five
pages of it–contain more meat, more sense, more literature, more
brilliancy, than that whole basketful of drowsy rubbish put together.
Why, in that dead atmosphere even Brooks himself is dull–he wearied me;
oh how he wearied me!</p>
<p>We had a noble good time in the Yacht, and caught a Chinese
missionary and drowned him. Love from us all to you all. MARK.</p>
<p>The assassination of President McKinley occurred September 6, 1901.
Such an event would naturally stir Mark Twain to comment on human nature
in general. His letter to Twichell is as individual as it is sound in
philosophy. At what period of his own life, or under what circumstances,
he made the long journey with tragic intent there is no means of knowing
now. There is no other mention of it elsewhere in the records that
survive him.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>AMPERSAND, Tuesday, (Sept. 10, 1901) DEAR JOE,–It is another off day,
but tomorrow I shall resume work to a certainty, and bid a long farewell
to letter-scribbling.</p>
<p>The news of the President looks decidedly hopeful, and we are all
glad, and the household faces are much improved, as to cheerfulness. Oh,
the talk in the newspapers! Evidently the Human Race is the same old
Human Race. And how unjust, and unreflectingly discriminating, the
talkers are. Under the unsettling effects of powerful emotion the
talkers are saying wild things, crazy things–they are out of themselves,
and do not know it; they are temporarily insane, yet with one voice they
declare the assassin sane–a man who has been entertaining fiery and
reason –debauching maggots in his head for weeks and months. Why, no one
is sane, straight along, year in and year out, and we all know it. Our
insanities are of varying sorts, and express themselves in varying forms
–fortunately harmless forms as a rule–but in whatever form they occur an
immense upheaval of feeling can at any time topple us distinctly over
the sanity-line for a little while; and then if our form happens to be
of the murderous kind we must look out–and so must the spectator.</p>
<p>This ass with the unpronounceable name was probably more insane than
usual this week or two back, and may get back upon his bearings by and
by, but he was over the sanity-border when he shot the President. It is
possible that it has taken him the whole interval since the murder of
the King of Italy to get insane enough to attempt the President’s life.
Without a doubt some thousands of men have been meditating the same act
in the same interval, but new and strong interests have intervened and
diverted their over-excited minds long enough to give them a chance to
settle, and tranquilize, and get back upon a healthy level again. Every
extraordinary occurrence unsettles the heads of hundreds of thousands of
men for a few moments or hours or days. If there had been ten kings
around when Humbert fell they would have been in great peril for a day
or more–and from men in whose presence they would have been quite safe
after the excess of their excitement had had an interval in which to
cool down. I bought a revolver once and travelled twelve hundred miles
to kill a man. He was away. He was gone a day. With nothing else to do,
I had to stop and think–and did. Within an hour–within half of it –I was
ashamed of myself–and felt unspeakably ridiculous. I do not know what to
call it if I was not insane. During a whole week my head was in a
turmoil night and day fierce enough and exhausting enough to upset a
stronger reason than mine.</p>
<p>All over the world, every day, there are some millions of men in that
condition temporarily. And in that time there is always a moment
–perhaps only a single one when they would do murder if their man was at
hand. If the opportunity comes a shade too late, the chances are that it
has come permanently too late. Opportunity seldom comes exactly at the
supreme moment. This saves a million lives a day in the world–for
sure.</p>
<p>No Ruler is ever slain but the tremendous details of it are
ravenously devoured by a hundred thousand men whose minds dwell,
unaware, near the temporary-insanity frontier–and over they go, now!
There is a day–two days–three–during which no Ruler would be safe from
perhaps the half of them; and there is a single moment wherein he would
not be safe from any of them, no doubt.</p>
<p>It may take this present shooting-case six months to breed another
ruler-tragedy, but it will breed it. There is at least one mind
somewhere which will brood, and wear, and decay itself to the
killing-point and produce that tragedy.</p>
<p>Every negro burned at the stake unsettles the excitable brain of
another one–I mean the inflaming details of his crime, and the lurid
theatricality of his exit do it–and the duplicate crime follows; and
that begets a repetition, and that one another one and so on. Every
lynching-account unsettles the brains of another set of excitable white
men, and lights another pyre–115 lynchings last year, 102 inside of 8
months this year; in ten years this will be habit, on these terms.</p>
<p>Yes, the wild talk you see in the papers! And from men who are sane
when not upset by overwhelming excitement. A U. S. Senator-Cullom–wants
this Buffalo criminal lynched! It would breed other lynchings–of men who
are not dreaming of committing murders, now, and will commit none if
Cullom will keep quiet and not provide the exciting cause.</p>
<p>And a District Attorney wants a law which shall punish with death
attempts upon a President’s life–this, mind you, as a deterrent. It
would have no effect–or the opposite one. The lunatic’s mind-space is
all occupied–as mine was–with the matter in hand; there is no room in it
for reflections upon what may happen to him. That comes after the
crime.</p>
<p>It is the noise the attempt would make in the world that would breed
the subsequent attempts, by unsettling the rickety minds of men who envy
the criminal his vast notoriety–his obscure name tongued by stupendous
Kings and Emperors–his picture printed everywhere, the trivialest
details of his movements, what he eats, what he drinks; how he sleeps,
what he says, cabled abroad over the whole globe at cost of fifty
thousand dollars a day–and he only a lowly shoemaker yesterday!–like the
assassin of the President of France–in debt three francs to his
landlady, and insulted by her–and to-day she is proud to be able to say
she knew him “as familiarly as you know your own brother,“ and glad to
stand till she drops and pour out columns and pages of her grandeur and
her happiness upon the eager interviewer.</p>
<p>Nothing will check the lynchings and ruler-murder but absolute
silence –the absence of pow-pow about them. How are you going to manage
that? By gagging every witness and jamming him into a dungeon for life;
by abolishing all newspapers; by exterminating all newspaper men; and by
extinguishing God’s most elegant invention, the Human Race. It is quite
simple, quite easy, and I hope you will take a day off and attend to it,
Joe. I blow a kiss to you, and am Lovingly Yours, MARK.</p>
<p>When the Adirondack summer ended Clemens settled for the winter in
the beautiful Appleton home at Riverdale-on-the-Hudson. It was a place
of wide-spreading grass and shade-a house of ample room. They were
established in it in time for Mark Twain to take an active interest in
the New York elections and assist a ticket for good government to defeat
Tammany Hall.</p>
