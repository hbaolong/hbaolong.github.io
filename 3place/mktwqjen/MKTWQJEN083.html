<h4 id="chapter-xvii.">CHAPTER XVII.</h4>
<p>At the end of our two days’ sojourn, we left Great Salt Lake City
hearty and well fed and happy–physically superb but not so very much
wiser, as regards the “Mormon question,“ than we were when we arrived,
perhaps. We had a deal more “information“ than we had before, of course,
but we did not know what portion of it was reliable and what was not–for
it all came from acquaintances of a day–strangers, strictly speaking. We
were told, for instance, that the dreadful “Mountain Meadows Massacre“
was the work of the Indians entirely, and that the Gentiles had meanly
tried to fasten it upon the Mormons; we were told, likewise, that the
Indians were to blame, partly, and partly the Mormons; and we were told,
likewise, and just as positively, that the Mormons were almost if not
wholly and completely responsible for that most treacherous and pitiless
butchery. We got the story in all these different shapes, but it was not
till several years afterward that Mrs. Waite’s book, “The Mormon
Prophet,“ came out with Judge Cradlebaugh’s trial of the accused parties
in it and revealed the truth that the latter version was the correct one
and that the Mormons were the assassins. All our “information“ had three
sides to it, and so I gave up the idea that I could settle the “Mormon
question“ in two days. Still I have seen newspaper correspondents do it
in one.</p>
<p>I left Great Salt Lake a good deal confused as to what state of
things existed there–and sometimes even questioning in my own mind
whether a state of things existed there at all or not. But presently I
remembered with a lightening sense of relief that we had learned two or
three trivial things there which we could be certain of; and so the two
days were not wholly lost. For instance, we had learned that we were at
last in a pioneer land, in absolute and tangible reality.</p>
<p>The high prices charged for trifles were eloquent of high freights
and bewildering distances of freightage. In the east, in those days, the
smallest moneyed denomination was a penny and it represented the
smallest purchasable quantity of any commodity. West of Cincinnati the
smallest coin in use was the silver five-cent piece and no smaller
quantity of an article could be bought than “five cents’ worth.“ In
Overland City the lowest coin appeared to be the ten-cent piece; but in
Salt Lake there did not seem to be any money in circulation smaller than
a quarter, or any smaller quantity purchasable of any commodity than
twenty-five cents’ worth. We had always been used to half dimes and
“five cents’ worth“ as the minimum of financial negotiations; but in
Salt Lake if one wanted a cigar, it was a quarter; if he wanted a chalk
pipe, it was a quarter; if he wanted a peach, or a candle, or a
newspaper, or a shave, or a little Gentile whiskey to rub on his corns
to arrest indigestion and keep him from having the toothache,
twenty-five cents was the price, every time. When we looked at the
shot-bag of silver, now and then, we seemed to be wasting our substance
in riotous living, but if we referred to the expense account we could
see that we had not been doing anything of the kind.</p>
<p>But people easily get reconciled to big money and big prices, and
fond and vain of both–it is a descent to little coins and cheap prices
that is hardest to bear and slowest to take hold upon one’s toleration.
After a month’s acquaintance with the twenty-five cent minimum, the
average human being is ready to blush every time he thinks of his
despicable five-cent days. How sunburnt with blushes I used to get in
gaudy Nevada, every time I thought of my first financial experience in
Salt Lake. It was on this wise (which is a favorite expression of great
authors, and a very neat one, too, but I never hear anybody say on this
wise when they are talking). A young half-breed with a complexion like a
yellow-jacket asked me if I would have my boots blacked. It was at the
Salt Lake House the morning after we arrived. I said yes, and he blacked
them. Then I handed him a silver five-cent piece, with the benevolent
air of a person who is conferring wealth and blessedness upon poverty
and suffering. The yellow-jacket took it with what I judged to be
suppressed emotion, and laid it reverently down in the middle of his
broad hand. Then he began to contemplate it, much as a philosopher
contemplates a gnat’s ear in the ample field of his microscope. Several
mountaineers, teamsters, stage-drivers, etc., drew near and dropped into
the tableau and fell to surveying the money with that attractive
indifference to formality which is noticeable in the hardy pioneer.
Presently the yellow-jacket handed the half dime back to me and told me
I ought to keep my money in my pocket-book instead of in my soul, and
then I wouldn’t get it cramped and shriveled up so!</p>
<p>What a roar of vulgar laughter there was! I destroyed the mongrel
reptile on the spot, but I smiled and smiled all the time I was
detaching his scalp, for the remark he made was good for an “Injun.“</p>
<p>Yes, we had learned in Salt Lake to be charged great prices without
letting the inward shudder appear on the surface–for even already we had
overheard and noted the tenor of conversations among drivers,
conductors, and hostlers, and finally among citizens of Salt Lake, until
we were well aware that these superior beings despised “emigrants.“ We
permitted no tell-tale shudders and winces in our countenances, for we
wanted to seem pioneers, or Mormons, half-breeds, teamsters,
stage-drivers, Mountain Meadow assassins–anything in the world that the
plains and Utah respected and admired–but we were wretchedly ashamed of
being “emigrants,“ and sorry enough that we had white shirts and could
not swear in the presence of ladies without looking the other way.</p>
<p>And many a time in Nevada, afterwards, we had occasion to remember
with humiliation that we were “emigrants,“ and consequently a low and
inferior sort of creatures. Perhaps the reader has visited Utah, Nevada,
or California, even in these latter days, and while communing with
himself upon the sorrowful banishment of these countries from what he
considers “the world,“ has had his wings clipped by finding that he is
the one to be pitied, and that there are entire populations around him
ready and willing to do it for him–yea, who are complacently doing it
for him already, wherever he steps his foot.</p>
<p>Poor thing, they are making fun of his hat; and the cut of his New
York coat; and his conscientiousness about his grammar; and his feeble
profanity; and his consumingly ludicrous ignorance of ores, shafts,
tunnels, and other things which he never saw before, and never felt
enough interest in to read about. And all the time that he is thinking
what a sad fate it is to be exiled to that far country, that lonely
land, the citizens around him are looking down on him with a blighting
compassion because he is an “emigrant“ instead of that proudest and
blessedest creature that exists on all the earth, a “FORTY-NINER.“</p>
<p>The accustomed coach life began again, now, and by midnight it almost
seemed as if we never had been out of our snuggery among the mail sacks
at all. We had made one alteration, however. We had provided enough
bread, boiled ham and hard boiled eggs to last double the six hundred
miles of staging we had still to do.</p>
<p>And it was comfort in those succeeding days to sit up and contemplate
the majestic panorama of mountains and valleys spread out below us and
eat ham and hard boiled eggs while our spiritual natures revelled
alternately in rainbows, thunderstorms, and peerless sunsets. Nothing
helps scenery like ham and eggs. Ham and eggs, and after these a pipe–an
old, rank, delicious pipe–ham and eggs and scenery, a “down grade,“ a
flying coach, a fragrant pipe and a contented heart–these make
happiness. It is what all the ages have struggled for.</p>
