<p>XSO THEY HANGED LUIGI</p>
<p>Dawson’s Landing had a week of repose, after the election, and it
needed it, for the frantic and variegated nightmare which had tormented
it all through the preceding week had left it limp, haggard, and
exhausted at the end. It got the week of repose because Angelo had the
legs, and was in too subdued a condition to want to go out and mingle
with an irritated community that had come to disgust and detest him
because there was such a lack of harmony between his morals, which were
confessedly excellent, and his methods of illustrating them, which were
distinctly damnable. The new city officers were sworn in on the
following Monday–at least all but Luigi. There was a complication in his
case. His election was conceded, but he could not sit in the board of
aldermen without his brother, and his brother could not sit there
because he was not a member. There seemed to be no way out of the
difficulty but to carry the matter into the courts, so this was resolved
upon.</p>
<p>The case was set for the Monday fortnight. In due course the time
arrived. In the mean time the city government had been at a standstill,
because with out Luigi there was a tie in the board of aldermen, whereas
with him the liquor interest–the richest in the political field–would
have one majority. But the court decided that Angelo could not sit in
the board with him, either in public or executive sessions, and at the
same time forbade the board to deny admission to Luigi, a fairly and
legally chosen alderman. The case was carried up and up from court to
court, yet still the same old original decision was confirmed every
time. As a result, the city government not only stood still, with its
hands tied, but everything it was created to protect and care for went a
steady gait toward rack and ruin. There was no way to levy a tax, so the
minor officials had to resign or starve; therefore they resigned. There
being no city money, the enormous legal expenses on both sides had to be
defrayed by private subscription. But at last the people came to their
senses, and said:</p>
<p>“Pudd’nhead was right at the start–we ought to have hired the
official half of that human phillipene to resign; but it’s too late now;
some of us haven’t got anything left to hire him with.“</p>
<p>“Yes, we have,“ said another citizen, “we’ve got this“–and he
produced a halter.</p>
<p>Many shouted: “That’s the ticket.“ But others said: “No–Count Angelo
is innocent; we mustn’t hang him.“</p>
<p>“Who said anything about hanging him? We are only going to hang the
other one.“</p>
<p>“Then that is all right–there is no objection to that.“</p>
<p>So they hanged Luigi. And so ends the history of “Those Extraordinary
Twins.“</p>
<p>FINAL REMARKS</p>
<p>As you see, it was an extravagant sort of a tale, and had no purpose
but to exhibit that monstrous “freak“ in all sorts of grotesque lights.
But when Roxy wandered into the tale she had to be furnished with
something to do; so she changed the children in the cradle; this
necessitated the invention of a reason for it; this, in turn, resulted
in making the children prominent personages–nothing could prevent it of
course. Their career began to take a tragic aspect, and some one had to
be brought in to help work the machinery; so Pudd’nhead Wilson was
introduced and taken on trial. By this time the whole show was being run
by the new people and in their interest, and the original show was
become side-tracked and forgotten; the twin-monster, and the heroine,
and the lads, and the old ladies had dwindled to inconsequentialities
and were merely in the way. Their story was one story, the new people’s
story was another story, and there was no connection between them, no
interdependence, no kinship. It is not practicable or rational to try to
tell two stories at the same time; so I dug out the farce and left the
tragedy.</p>
<p>The reader already knew how the expert works; he knows now how the
other kind do it.</p>

<p>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE</p>
<p>To arrive at a just estimate of a renowned man’s character one must
judge it by the standards of his time, not ours. Judged by the standards
of one century, the noblest characters of an earlier one lose much of
their luster; judged by the standards of to-day, there is probably no
illustrious man of four or five centuries ago whose character could meet
the test at all points. But the character of Joan of Arc is unique. It
can be measured by the standards of all times without misgiving or
apprehension as to the result. Judged by any of them, it is still
flawless, it is still ideally perfect; it still occupies the loftiest
place possible to human attainment, a loftier one than has been reached
by any other mere mortal.</p>
<p>When we reflect that her century was the brutalest, the wickedest,
the rottenest in history since the darkest ages, we are lost in wonder
at the miracle of such a product from such a soil. The contrast between
her and her century is the contrast between day and night. She was
truthful when lying was the common speech of men; she was honest when
honesty was become a lost virtue; she was a keeper of promises when the
keeping of a promise was expected of no one; she gave her great mind to
great thoughts and great purposes when other great minds wasted
themselves upon pretty fancies or upon poor ambitions; she was modest,
and fine, and delicate when to be loud and coarse might be said to be
universal; she was full of pity when a merciless cruelty was the rule;
she was steadfast when stability was unknown, and honorable in an age
which had forgotten what honor was; she was a rock of convictions in a
time when men believed in nothing and scoffed at all things; she was
unfailingly true to an age that was false to the core; she maintained
her personal dignity unimpaired in an age of fawnings and servilities;
she was of a dauntless courage when hope and courage had perished in the
hearts of her nation; she was spotlessly pure in mind and body when
society in the highest places was foul in both–she was all these things
in an age when crime was the common business of lords and princes, and
when the highest personages in Christendom were able to astonish even
that infamous era and make it stand aghast at the spectacle of their
atrocious lives black with unimaginable treacheries, butcheries, and
beastialities.</p>
<p>She was perhaps the only entirely unselfish person whose name has a
place in profane history. No vestige or suggestion of self-seeking can
be found in any word or deed of hers. When she had rescued her King from
his vagabondage, and set his crown upon his head, she was offered
rewards and honors, but she refused them all, and would take nothing.
All she would take for herself–if the King would grant it–was leave to
go back to her village home, and tend her sheep again, and feel her
mother’s arms about her, and be her housemaid and helper. The
selfishness of this unspoiled general of victorious armies, companion of
princes, and idol of an applauding and grateful nation, reached but that
far and no farther.</p>
<p>The work wrought by Joan of Arc may fairly be regarded as ranking any
recorded in history, when one considers the conditions under which it
was undertaken, the obstacles in the way, and the means at her disposal.
Caesar carried conquests far, but he did it with the trained and
confident veterans of Rome, and was a trained soldier himself; and
Napoleon swept away the disciplined armies of Europe, but he also was a
trained soldier, and the began his work with patriot battalions inflamed
and inspired by the miracle-working new breath of Liberty breathed upon
them by the Revolution–eager young apprentices to the splendid trade of
war, not old and broken men-at-arms, despairing survivors of an age-long
accumulation of monotonous defeats; but Joan of Arc, a mere child in
years, ignorant, unlettered, a poor village girl unknown and without
influence, found a great nation lying in chains, helpless and hopeless
under an alien domination, its treasury bankrupt, its soldiers
disheartened and dispersed, all spirit torpid, all courage dead in the
hearts of the people through long years of foreign and domestic outrage
and oppression, their King cowed, resigned to its fate, and preparing to
fly the country; and she laid her hand upon this nation, this corpse,
and it rose and followed her. She led it from victory to victory, she
turned back the tide of the Hundred Years’ War, she fatally crippled the
English power, and died with the earned title of DELIVERER OF FRANCE,
which she bears to this day.</p>
<p>And for all reward, the French King, whom she had crowned, stood
supine and indifferent, while French priests took the noble child, the
most innocent, the most lovely, the most adorable the ages have
produced, and burned her alive at the stake.</p>
<p>A PECULIARITY OF JOAN OF ARC’S HISTORY</p>
<p>The details of the life of Joan of Arc form a biography which is
unique among the world’s biographies in one respect: It is the only
story of a human life which comes to us under oath, the only one which
comes to us from the witness-stand. The official records of the Great
Trial of 1431, and of the Process of Rehabilitation of a quarter of a
century later, are still preserved in the National Archives of France,
and they furnish with remarkable fullness the facts of her life. The
history of no other life of that remote time is known with either the
certainty or the comprehensiveness that attaches to hers.</p>
<p>The Sieur Louis de Conte is faithful to her official history in his
Personal Recollections, and thus far his trustworthiness is
unimpeachable; but his mass of added particulars must depend for credit
upon his word alone.</p>
<p>THE TRANSLATOR.</p>
<p>THE SIEUR LOUIS DE CONTE</p>
<p>To his Great-Great-Grand Nephews and Nieces</p>
<p>This is the year 1492. I am eighty-two years of age. The things I am
going to tell you are things which I saw myself as a child and as a
youth.</p>
<p>In all the tales and songs and histories of Joan of Arc, which you
and the rest of the world read and sing and study in the books wrought
in the late invented art of printing, mention is made of me, the Sieur
Louis de Conte–I was her page and secretary, I was with her from the
beginning until the end.</p>
<p>I was reared in the same village with her. I played with her every
day, when we were little children together, just as you play with your
mates. Now that we perceive how great she was, now that her name fills
the whole world, it seems strange that what I am saying is true; for it
is as if a perishable paltry candle should speak of the eternal sun
riding in the heavens and say, “He was gossip and housemate to me when
we were candles together.“ And yet it is true, just as I say. I was her
playmate, and I fought at her side in the wars; to this day I carry in
my mind, fine and clear, the picture of that dear little figure, with
breast bent to the flying horse’s neck, charging at the head of the
armies of France, her hair streaming back, her silver mail plowing
steadily deeper and deeper into the thick of the battle, sometimes
nearly drowned from sight by tossing heads of horses, uplifted
sword-arms, wind-blow plumes, and intercepting shields. I was with her
to the end; and when that black day came whose accusing shadow will lie
always upon the memory of the mitered French slaves of England who were
her assassins, and upon France who stood idle and essayed no rescue, my
hand was the last she touched in life.</p>
<p>As the years and the decades drifted by, and the spectacle of the
marvelous child’s meteor flight across the war firmament of France and
its extinction in the smoke-clouds of the stake receded deeper and
deeper into the past and grew ever more strange, and wonderful, and
divine, and pathetic, I came to comprehend and recognize her at last for
what she was–the most noble life that was ever born into this world save
only One.</p>
