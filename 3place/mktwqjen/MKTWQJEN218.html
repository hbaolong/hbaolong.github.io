<h4 id="a-fine-old-man">A FINE OLD MAN</h4>
<p>John Wagner, the oldest man in Buffalo–one hundred and four years old
–recently walked a mile and a half in two weeks.</p>
<p>He is as cheerful and bright as any of these other old men that
charge around so persistently and tiresomely in the newspapers, and in
every way as remarkable.</p>
<p>Last November he walked five blocks in a rainstorm, without any
shelter but an umbrella, and cast his vote for Grant, remarking that he
had voted for forty-seven presidents–which was a lie.</p>
<p>His “second crop“ of rich brown hair arrived from New York yesterday,
and he has a new set of teeth coming from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>He is to be married next week to a girl one hundred and two years
old, who still takes in washing.</p>
<p>They have been engaged eighty years, but their parents persistently
refused their consent until three days ago.</p>
<p>John Wagner is two years older than the Rhode Island veteran, and yet
has never tasted a drop of liquor in his life–unless-unless you count
whisky.</p>
<p>SCIENCE V.S. LUCK–[Written about 1867.]</p>
<p>At that time, in Kentucky (said the Hon. Mr. K—–); the law was very
strict against what is termed “games of chance.“ About a dozen of the
boys were detected playing “seven up“ or “old sledge“ for money, and the
grand jury found a true bill against them. Jim Sturgis was retained to
defend them when the case came up, of course. The more he studied over
the matter, and looked into the evidence, the plainer it was that he
must lose a case at last–there was no getting around that painful fact.
Those boys had certainly been betting money on a game of chance. Even
public sympathy was roused in behalf of Sturgis. People said it was a
pity to see him mar his successful career with a big prominent case like
this, which must go against him.</p>
<p>But after several restless nights an inspired idea flashed upon
Sturgis, and he sprang out of bed delighted. He thought he saw his way
through. The next day he whispered around a little among his clients and
a few friends, and then when the case came up in court he acknowledged
the seven-up and the betting, and, as his sole defense, had the
astounding effrontery to put in the plea that old sledge was not a game
of chance! There was the broadest sort of a smile all over the faces of
that sophisticated audience. The judge smiled with the rest. But Sturgis
maintained a countenance whose earnestness was even severe. The opposite
counsel tried to ridicule him out of his position, and did not succeed.
The judge jested in a ponderous judicial way about the thing, but did
not move him. The matter was becoming grave. The judge lost a little of
his patience, and said the joke had gone far enough. Jim Sturgis said he
knew of no joke in the matter–his clients could not be punished for
indulging in what some people chose to consider a game of chance until
it was proven that it was a game of chance. Judge and counsel said that
would be an easy matter, and forthwith called Deacons Job, Peters,
Burke, and Johnson, and Dominies Wirt and Miggles, to testify; and they
unanimously and with strong feeling put down the legal quibble of
Sturgis by pronouncing that old sledge was a game of chance.</p>
<p>“What do you call it now?“ said the judge.</p>
<p>“I call it a game of science!“ retorted Sturgis; “and I’ll prove it,
too!“</p>
<p>They saw his little game.</p>
<p>He brought in a cloud of witnesses, and produced an overwhelming mass
of testimony, to show that old sledge was not a game of chance but a
game of science.</p>
<p>Instead of being the simplest case in the world, it had somehow
turned out to be an excessively knotty one. The judge scratched his head
over it awhile, and said there was no way of coming to a determination,
because just as many men could be brought into court who would testify
on one side as could be found to testify on the other. But he said he
was willing to do the fair thing by all parties, and would act upon any
suggestion Mr. Sturgis would make for the solution of the
difficulty.</p>
<p>Mr. Sturgis was on his feet in a second.</p>
<p>“Impanel a jury of six of each, Luck versus Science. Give them
candles and a couple of decks of cards. Send them into the jury-room,
and just abide by the result!“</p>
<p>There was no disputing the fairness of the proposition. The four
deacons and the two dominies were sworn in as the “chance“ jurymen, and
six inveterate old seven-up professors were chosen to represent the
“science“ side of the issue. They retired to the jury-room.</p>
<p>In about two hours Deacon Peters sent into court to borrow three
dollars from a friend. [Sensation.] In about two hours more Dominie
Miggles sent into court to borrow a “stake“ from a friend. [Sensation.]
During the next three or four hours the other dominie and the other
deacons sent into court for small loans. And still the packed audience
waited, for it was a prodigious occasion in Bull’s Corners, and one in
which every father of a family was necessarily interested.</p>
<p>The rest of the story can be told briefly. About daylight the jury
came in, and Deacon Job, the foreman, read the following:</p>
<p>VERDICT:</p>
<p>We, the jury in the case of the Commonwealth of Kentucky vs. John
Wheeler et al., have carefully considered the points of the case, and
tested the merits of the several theories advanced, and do hereby
unanimously decide that the game commonly known as old sledge or
seven-up is eminently a game of science and not of chance. In
demonstration whereof it is hereby and herein stated, iterated,
reiterated, set forth, and made manifest that, during the entire night,
the “chance“ men never won a game or turned a jack, although both feats
were common and frequent to the opposition; and furthermore, in support
of this our verdict, we call attention to the significant fact that the
“chance“ men are all busted, and the “science“ men have got the money.
It is the deliberate opinion of this jury, that the “chance“ theory
concerning seven-up is a pernicious doctrine, and calculated to inflict
untold suffering and pecuniary loss upon any community that takes stock
in it.</p>
<p>“That is the way that seven-up came to be set apart and
particularized in the statute-books of Kentucky as being a game not of
chance but of science, and therefore not punishable under the law,“ said
Mr. K—–. “That verdict is of record, and holds good to this day.“</p>
<p>THE LATE BENJAMIN FRANKLIN–[Written about 1870.]</p>
<p>[“Never put off till to-morrow what you can do day after to-morrow
just as well.“–B. F.]</p>
<p>This party was one of those persons whom they call Philosophers. He
was twins, being born simultaneously in two different houses in the city
of Boston. These houses remain unto this day, and have signs upon them
worded in accordance with the facts. The signs are considered well
enough to have, though not necessary, because the inhabitants point out
the two birthplaces to the stranger anyhow, and sometimes as often as
several times in the same day. The subject of this memoir was of a
vicious disposition, and early prostituted his talents to the invention
of maxims and aphorisms calculated to inflict suffering upon the rising
generation of all subsequent ages. His simplest acts, also, were
contrived with a view to their being held up for the emulation of boys
forever–boys who might otherwise have been happy. It was in this spirit
that he became the son of a soap-boiler, and probably for no other
reason than that the efforts of all future boys who tried to be anything
might be looked upon with suspicion unless they were the sons of
soap-boilers. With a malevolence which is without parallel in history,
he would work all day, and then sit up nights, and let on to be studying
algebra by the light of a smoldering fire, so that all other boys might
have to do that also, or else have Benjamin Franklin thrown up to them.
Not satisfied with these proceedings, he had a fashion of living wholly
on bread and water, and studying astronomy at meal-time–a thing which
has brought affliction to millions of boys since, whose fathers had read
Franklin’s pernicious biography.</p>
<p>His maxims were full of animosity toward boys. Nowadays a boy cannot
follow out a single natural instinct without tumbling over some of those
everlasting aphorisms and hearing from Franklin, on the spot. If he buys
two cents’ worth of peanuts, his father says, “Remember what Franklin
has said, my son–‘A grout a day’s a penny a year“’; and the comfort is
all gone out of those peanuts. If he wants to spin his top when he has
done work, his father quotes, “Procrastination is the thief of time.“ If
he does a virtuous action, he never gets anything for it, because
“Virtue is its own reward.“ And that boy is hounded to death and robbed
of his natural rest, because Franklin, said once, in one of his inspired
flights of malignity:</p>
<p>Early to bed and early to rise Makes a man healthy and wealthy and
wise.</p>
<p>As if it were any object to a boy to be healthy and wealthy and wise
on such terms. The sorrow that that maxim has cost me, through my
parents, experimenting on me with it, tongue cannot tell. The legitimate
result is my present state of general debility, indigence, and mental
aberration. My parents used to have me up before nine o’clock in the
morning sometimes when I was a boy. If they had let me take my natural
rest where would I have been now? Keeping store, no doubt, and respected
by all.</p>
<p>And what an adroit old adventurer the subject of this memoir was! In
order to get a chance to fly his kite on Sunday he used to hang a key on
the string and let on to be fishing for lightning. And a guileless
public would go home chirping about the “wisdom“ and the “genius“ of the
hoary Sabbath-breaker. If anybody caught him playing “mumblepeg“ by
himself, after the age of sixty, he would immediately appear to be
ciphering out how the grass grew–as if it was any of his business. My
grandfather knew him well, and he says Franklin was always fixed–always
ready. If a body, during his old age, happened on him unexpectedly when
he was catching flies, or making mud-pies, or sliding on a cellar door,
he would immediately look wise, and rip out a maxim, and walk off with
his nose in the air and his cap turned wrong side before, trying to
appear absent-minded and eccentric. He was a hard lot.</p>
<p>He invented a stove that would smoke your head off in four hours by
the clock. One can see the almost devilish satisfaction he took in it by
his giving it his name.</p>
<p>He was always proud of telling how he entered Philadelphia for the
first time, with nothing in the world but two shillings in his pocket
and four rolls of bread under his arm. But really, when you come to
examine it critically, it was nothing. Anybody could have done it.</p>
<p>To the subject of this memoir belongs the honor of recommending the
army to go back to bows and arrows in place of bayonets and muskets. He
observed, with his customary force, that the bayonet was very well under
some circumstances, but that he doubted whether it could be used with
accuracy at a long range.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin did a great many notable things for his country,
and made her young name to be honored in many lands as the mother of
such a son. It is not the idea of this memoir to ignore that or cover it
up. No; the simple idea of it is to snub those pretentious maxims of
his, which he worked up with a great show of originality out of truisms
that had become wearisome platitudes as early as the dispersion from
Babel; and also to snub his stove, and his military inspirations, his
unseemly endeavor to make himself conspicuous when he entered
Philadelphia, and his flying his kite and fooling away his time in all
sorts of such ways when he ought to have been foraging for soap-fat, or
constructing candles. I merely desired to do away with somewhat of the
prevalent calamitous idea among heads of families that Franklin acquired
his great genius by working for nothing, studying by moonlight, and
getting up in the night instead of waiting till morning like a
Christian; and that this program, rigidly inflicted, will make a
Franklin of every father’s fool. It is time these gentlemen were finding
out that these execrable eccentricities of instinct and conduct are only
the evidences of genius, not the creators of it. I wish I had been the
father of my parents long enough to make them comprehend this truth, and
thus prepare them to let their son have an easier time of it. When I was
a child I had to boil soap, notwithstanding my father was wealthy, and I
had to get up early and study geometry at breakfast, and peddle my own
poetry, and do everything just as Franklin did, in the solemn hope that
I would be a Franklin some day. And here I am.</p>
<p>MR. BLOKE’S ITEM–[Written about 1865.]</p>
<p>Our esteemed friend, Mr. John William Bloke, of Virginia City, walked
into the office where we are sub-editor at a late hour last night, with
an expression of profound and heartfelt suffering upon his countenance,
and, sighing heavily, laid the following item reverently upon the desk,
and walked slowly out again. He paused a moment at the door, and seemed
struggling to command his feelings sufficiently to enable him to speak,
and then, nodding his head toward his manuscript, ejaculated in a broken
voice, “Friend of mine–oh! how sad!“ and burst into tears. We were so
moved at his distress that we did not think to call him back and
endeavor to comfort him until he was gone, and it was too late. The
paper had already gone to press, but knowing that our friend would
consider the publication of this item important, and cherishing the hope
that to print it would afford a melancholy satisfaction to his sorrowing
heart, we stopped, the press at once and inserted it in our columns:</p>
<p>DISTRESSING ACCIDENT.–Last evening, about six o’clock, as Mr. William
Schuyler, an old and respectable citizen of South Park, was leaving his
residence to go down-town, as has been his usual custom for many years
with the exception only of a short interval in the spring of 1850,
during which he was confined to his bed by injuries received in
attempting to stop a runaway horse by thoughtlessly placing himself
directly in its wake and throwing up his hands and shouting, which if he
had done so even a single moment sooner, must inevitably have frightened
the animal still more instead of checking its speed, although disastrous
enough to himself as it was, and rendered more melancholy and
distressing by reason of the presence of his wife’s mother, who was
there and saw the sad occurrence notwithstanding it is at least likely,
though not necessarily so, that she should be reconnoitering in another
direction when incidents occur, not being vivacious and on the lookout,
as a general thing, but even the reverse, as her own mother is said to
have stated, who is no more, but died in the full hope of a glorious
resurrection, upwards of three years ago; aged eighty-six, being a
Christian woman and without guile, as it were, or property, in
consequence of the fire of 1849, which destroyed every single thing she
had in the world. But such is life. Let us all take warning by this
solemn occurrence, and let us endeavor so to conduct ourselves that when
we come to die we can do it. Let us place our hands upon our heart, and
say with earnestness and sincerity that from this day forth we will
beware of the intoxicating bowl.–‘First Edition of the Californian.’</p>
<p>The head editor has been in here raising the mischief, and tearing
his hair and kicking the furniture about, and abusing me like a
pickpocket. He says that every time he leaves me in charge of the paper
for half an hour I get imposed upon by the first infant or the first
idiot that comes along. And he says that that distressing item of
Mr. Bloke’s is nothing but a lot of distressing bash, and has no point
to it, and no sense in it, and no information in it, and that there was
no sort of necessity for stopping the press to publish it.</p>
<p>Now all this comes of being good-hearted. If I had been as
unaccommodating and unsympathetic as some people, I would have told
Mr. Bloke that I wouldn’t receive his communication at such a late hour;
but no, his snuffling distress touched my heart, and I jumped at the
chance of doing something to modify his misery. I never read his item to
see whether there was anything wrong about it, but hastily wrote the few
lines which preceded it, and sent it to the printers. And what has my
kindness done for me? It has done nothing but bring down upon me a storm
of abuse and ornamental blasphemy.</p>
<p>Now I will read that item myself, and see if there is any foundation
for all this fuss. And if there is, the author of it shall hear from
me.</p>
<p>I have read it, and I am bound to admit that it seems a little mixed
at a first glance. However, I will peruse it once more.</p>
<p>I have read it again, and it does really seem a good deal more mixed
than ever.</p>
<p>I have read it over five times, but if I can get at the meaning of it
I wish I may get my just deserts. It won’t bear analysis. There are
things about it which I cannot understand at all. It don’t say whatever
became of William Schuyler. It just says enough about him to get one
interested in his career, and then drops him. Who is William Schuyler,
anyhow, and what part of South Park did he live in, and if he started
down-town at six o’clock, did he ever get there, and if he did, did
anything happen to him? Is he the individual that met with the
“distressing accident“? Considering the elaborate circumstantiality of
detail observable in the item, it seems to me that it ought to contain
more information than it does. On the contrary, it is obscure and not
only obscure, but utterly incomprehensible. Was the breaking of
Mr. Schuyler’s leg, fifteen years ago, the “distressing accident“ that
plunged Mr. Bloke into unspeakable grief, and caused him to come up here
at dead of night and stop our press to acquaint the world with the
circumstance? Or did the “distressing accident“ consist in the
destruction of Schuyler’s mother-in-law’s property in early times? Or
did it consist in the death of that person herself three years ago
(albeit it does not appear that she died by accident)? In a word, what
did that “distressing accident“ consist in? What did that driveling ass
of a Schuyler stand in the wake of a runaway horse for, with his
shouting and gesticulating, if he wanted to stop him? And how the
mischief could he get run over by a horse that had already passed beyond
him? And what are we to take “warning“ by? And how is this extraordinary
chapter of incomprehensibilities going to be a “lesson“ to us? And,
above all, what has the intoxicating “bowl“ got to do with it, anyhow?
It is not stated that Schuyler drank, or that his wife drank, or that
his mother-in-law drank, or that the horse drank wherefore, then, the
reference to the intoxicating bowl? It does seem to me that if Mr. Bloke
had let the intoxicating bowl alone himself, he never would have got
into so much trouble about this exasperating imaginary accident. I have
read this. absurd item over and over again, with all its insinuating
plausibility, until my head swims; but I can make neither head nor tail
of it. There certainly seems to have been an accident of some kind or
other, but it is impossible to determine what the nature of it was, or
who was the sufferer by it. I do not like to do it, but I feel compelled
to request that the next time anything happens to one of Mr. Bloke’s
friends, he will append such explanatory notes to his account of it as
will enable me to find out what sort of an accident it was and whom it
happened to. I had rather all his friends should die than that I should
be driven to the verge of lunacy again in trying to cipher out the
meaning of another such production as the above.</p>
