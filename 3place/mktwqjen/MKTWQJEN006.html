<h4 id="chapter-v.">CHAPTER V.</h4>
<p>Taking it “by and large,“ as the sailors say, we had a pleasant ten
days’ run from New York to the Azores islands–not a fast run, for the
distance is only twenty-four hundred miles, but a right pleasant one in
the main. True, we had head winds all the time, and several stormy
experiences which sent fifty percent of the passengers to bed sick and
made the ship look dismal and deserted–stormy experiences that all will
remember who weathered them on the tumbling deck and caught the vast
sheets of spray that every now and then sprang high in air from the
weather bow and swept the ship like a thunder-shower; but for the most
part we had balmy summer weather and nights that were even finer than
the days. We had the phenomenon of a full moon located just in the same
spot in the heavens at the same hour every night. The reason of this
singular conduct on the part of the moon did not occur to us at first,
but it did afterward when we reflected that we were gaining about twenty
minutes every day because we were going east so fast–we gained just
about enough every day to keep along with the moon. It was becoming an
old moon to the friends we had left behind us, but to us Joshuas it
stood still in the same place and remained always the same.</p>
<p>Young Mr. Blucher, who is from the Far West and is on his first
voyage, was a good deal worried by the constantly changing “ship time.“
He was proud of his new watch at first and used to drag it out promptly
when eight bells struck at noon, but he came to look after a while as if
he were losing confidence in it. Seven days out from New York he came on
deck and said with great decision:</p>
<p>“This thing’s a swindle!“</p>
<p>“What’s a swindle?“</p>
<p>“Why, this watch. I bought her out in Illinois–gave 50 for her–and I
thought she was good. And, by George, she is good onshore, but somehow
she don’t keep up her lick here on the water–gets seasick may be. She
skips; she runs along regular enough till half-past eleven, and then,
all of a sudden, she lets down. I’ve set that old regulator up faster
and faster, till I’ve shoved it clear around, but it don’t do any good;
she just distances every watch in the ship, and clatters along in a way
that’s astonishing till it is noon, but them eight bells always gets in
about ten minutes ahead of her anyway. I don’t know what to do with her
now. She’s doing all she can–she’s going her best gait, but it won’t
save her. Now, don’t you know, there ain’t a watch in the ship that’s
making better time than she is, but what does it signify? When you hear
them eight bells you’ll find her just about ten minutes short of her
score sure.“</p>
<p>The ship was gaining a full hour every three days, and this fellow
was trying to make his watch go fast enough to keep up to her. But, as
he had said, he had pushed the regulator up as far as it would go, and
the watch was “on its best gait,“ and so nothing was left him but to
fold his hands and see the ship beat the race. We sent him to the
captain, and he explained to him the mystery of “ship time“ and set his
troubled mind at rest. This young man asked a great many questions about
seasickness before we left, and wanted to know what its characteristics
were and how he was to tell when he had it. He found out.</p>
<p>We saw the usual sharks, blackfish, porpoises, andandandandc., of
course, and by and by large schools of Portuguese men-of-war were added
to the regular list of sea wonders. Some of them were white and some of
a brilliant carmine color. The nautilus is nothing but a transparent web
of jelly that spreads itself to catch the wind, and has fleshy-looking
strings a foot or two long dangling from it to keep it steady in the
water. It is an accomplished sailor and has good sailor judgment. It
reefs its sail when a storm threatens or the wind blows pretty hard, and
furls it entirely and goes down when a gale blows. Ordinarily it keeps
its sail wet and in good sailing order by turning over and dipping it in
the water for a moment. Seamen say the nautilus is only found in these
waters between the 35th and 45th parallels of latitude.</p>
<p>At three o’clock on the morning of the twenty-first of June, we were
awakened and notified that the Azores islands were in sight. I said I
did not take any interest in islands at three o’clock in the morning.
But another persecutor came, and then another and another, and finally
believing that the general enthusiasm would permit no one to slumber in
peace, I got up and went sleepily on deck. It was five and a half
o’clock now, and a raw, blustering morning. The passengers were huddled
about the smoke-stacks and fortified behind ventilators, and all were
wrapped in wintry costumes and looking sleepy and unhappy in the
pitiless gale and the drenching spray.</p>
<p>The island in sight was Flores. It seemed only a mountain of mud
standing up out of the dull mists of the sea. But as we bore down upon
it the sun came out and made it a beautiful picture–a mass of green
farms and meadows that swelled up to a height of fifteen hundred feet
and mingled its upper outlines with the clouds. It was ribbed with
sharp, steep ridges and cloven with narrow canyons, and here and there
on the heights, rocky upheavals shaped themselves into mimic battlements
and castles; and out of rifted clouds came broad shafts of sunlight,
that painted summit, and slope and glen, with bands of fire, and left
belts of somber shade between. It was the aurora borealis of the frozen
pole exiled to a summer land!</p>
<p>We skirted around two-thirds of the island, four miles from shore,
and all the opera glasses in the ship were called into requisition to
settle disputes as to whether mossy spots on the uplands were groves of
trees or groves of weeds, or whether the white villages down by the sea
were really villages or only the clustering tombstones of cemeteries.
Finally we stood to sea and bore away for San Miguel, and Flores shortly
became a dome of mud again and sank down among the mists, and
disappeared. But to many a seasick passenger it was good to see the
green hills again, and all were more cheerful after this episode than
anybody could have expected them to be, considering how sinfully early
they had gotten up.</p>
<p>But we had to change our purpose about San Miguel, for a storm came
up about noon that so tossed and pitched the vessel that common sense
dictated a run for shelter. Therefore we steered for the nearest island
of the group–Fayal (the people there pronounce it Fy-all, and put the
accent on the first syllable). We anchored in the open roadstead of
Horta, half a mile from the shore. The town has eight thousand to ten
thousand inhabitants. Its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea of
fresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or more
attractive. It sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills which are
three hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefully cultivated clear
to their summits–not a foot of soil left idle. Every farm and every acre
is cut up into little square inclosures by stone walls, whose duty it is
to protect the growing products from the destructive gales that blow
there. These hundreds of green squares, marked by their black lava
walls, make the hills look like vast checkerboards.</p>
<p>The islands belong to Portugal, and everything in Fayal has
Portuguese characteristics about it. But more of that anon. A swarm of
swarthy, noisy, lying, shoulder-shrugging, gesticulating Portuguese
boatmen, with brass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts,
climbed the ship’s sides, and various parties of us contracted with them
to take us ashore at so much a head, silver coin of any country. We
landed under the walls of a little fort, armed with batteries of
twelve-and-thirty-two-pounders, which Horta considered a most formidable
institution, but if we were ever to get after it with one of our
turreted monitors, they would have to move it out in the country if they
wanted it where they could go and find it again when they needed it. The
group on the pier was a rusty one–men and women, and boys and girls, all
ragged and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education,
and profession beggars. They trooped after us, and never more while we
tarried in Fayal did we get rid of them. We walked up the middle of the
principal street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides and glared
upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession
to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the
elephant on his advertising trip from street to street. It was very
flattering to me to be part of the material for such a sensation. Here
and there in the doorways we saw women with fashionable Portuguese hoods
on. This hood is of thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same
stuff, and is a marvel of ugliness. It stands up high and spreads far
abroad, and is unfathomably deep. It fits like a circus tent, and a
woman’s head is hidden away in it like the man’s who prompts the singers
from his tin shed in the stage of an opera. There is no particle of
trimming about this monstrous capote, as they call it–it is just a
plain, ugly dead-blue mass of sail, and a woman can’t go within eight
points of the wind with one of them on; she has to go before the wind or
not at all. The general style of the capote is the same in all the
islands, and will remain so for the next ten thousand years, but each
island shapes its capotes just enough differently from the others to
enable an observer to tell at a glance what particular island a lady
hails from.</p>
<p>The Portuguese pennies, or reis (pronounced rays), are prodigious. It
takes one thousand reis to make a dollar, and all financial estimates
are made in reis. We did not know this until after we had found it out
through Blucher. Blucher said he was so happy and so grateful to be on
solid land once more that he wanted to give a feast–said he had heard it
was a cheap land, and he was bound to have a grand banquet. He invited
nine of us, and we ate an excellent dinner at the principal hotel. In
the midst of the jollity produced by good cigars, good wine, and
passable anecdotes, the landlord presented his bill. Blucher glanced at
it and his countenance fell. He took another look to assure himself that
his senses had not deceived him and then read the items aloud, in a
faltering voice, while the roses in his cheeks turned to ashes:</p>
<p>“‘Ten dinners, at 600 reis, 6,000 reis!’ Ruin and desolation!</p>
<p>“‘Twenty-five cigars, at 100 reis, 2,500 reis!’ Oh, my sainted
mother!</p>
<p>“‘Eleven bottles of wine, at 1,200 reis, 13,200 reis!’ Be with us
all!</p>
<p>“‘TOTAL, TWENTY-ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED REIS!’ The suffering
Moses! There ain’t money enough in the ship to pay that bill! Go–leave
me to my misery, boys, I am a ruined community.“</p>
<p>I think it was the blankest-looking party I ever saw. Nobody could
say a word. It was as if every soul had been stricken dumb. Wine glasses
descended slowly to the table, their contents untasted. Cigars dropped
unnoticed from nerveless fingers. Each man sought his neighbor’s eye,
but found in it no ray of hope, no encouragement. At last the fearful
silence was broken. The shadow of a desperate resolve settled upon
Blucher’s countenance like a cloud, and he rose up and said:</p>
<p>“Landlord, this is a low, mean swindle, and I’ll never, never stand
it. Here’s a hundred and fifty dollars, Sir, and it’s all you’ll
get–I’ll swim in blood before I’ll pay a cent more.“</p>
<p>Our spirits rose and the landlord’s fell–at least we thought so; he
was confused, at any rate, notwithstanding he had not understood a word
that had been said. He glanced from the little pile of gold pieces to
Blucher several times and then went out. He must have visited an
American, for when he returned, he brought back his bill translated into
a language that a Christian could understand–thus:</p>
<p>10 dinners, 6,000 reis, or . . ..00</p>
<p>25 cigars, 2,500 reis, or . . . 2.50</p>
<p>11 bottles wine, 13,200 reis, or 13.20</p>
<p>Total 21,700 reis, or . . . . 1.70</p>
<p>Happiness reigned once more in Blucher’s dinner party. More
refreshments were ordered.</p>
