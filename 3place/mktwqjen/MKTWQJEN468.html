<h4 id="chapter-xxv.">CHAPTER XXV.</h4>
<p>THE news was all over town in two minutes, and you could see the
people tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them
putting on their coats as they come. Pretty soon we was in the middle of
a crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The
windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say,
over a fence:</p>
<p>“Is it THEM?“</p>
<p>And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and
say:</p>
<p>“You bet it is.“</p>
<p>When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and
the three girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane WAS red-headed, but
that don’t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her
face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles
was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she jumped for
them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they HAD it!
Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet again at
last and have such good times.</p>
<p>Then the king he hunched the duke private–I see him do it–and then he
looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so
then him and the duke, with a hand across each other’s shoulder, and
t’other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there, everybody
dropping back to give them room, and all the talk and noise stopping,
people saying “Sh!“ and all the men taking their hats off and drooping
their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall. And when they got there
they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then
they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and
then they put their arms around each other’s necks, and hung their chins
over each other’s shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,
I never see two men leak the way they done. And, mind you, everybody was
doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything like
it. Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, and t’other on
t’other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the
coffin, and let on to pray all to themselves. Well, when it come to that
it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and everybody
broke down and went to sobbing right out loud–the poor girls, too; and
every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a word, and
kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand on their
head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running down, and
then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give the next
woman a show. I never see anything so disgusting.</p>
<p>Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and
works himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and
flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to
lose the diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long
journey of four thousand mile, but it’s a trial that’s sweetened and
sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he
thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother’s heart, because out
of their mouths they can’t, words being too weak and cold, and all that
kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he blubbers
out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to crying
fit to bust.</p>
<p>And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the
crowd struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their
might, and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church
letting out. Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and
hogwash I never see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and
bully.</p>
<p>Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his
nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the
family would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up
with the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying
yonder could speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that
was very dear to him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will
name the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.:–Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon
Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and
Dr. Robinson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.</p>
<p>Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town
a-hunting together–that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to
t’other world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was
away up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so they
all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to
him; and then they shook hands with the duke and didn’t say nothing, but
just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads
whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said
“Goo-goo–goo-goo-goo“ all the time, like a baby that can’t talk.</p>
<p>So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty
much everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of
little things that happened one time or another in the town, or to
George’s family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote him
the things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them out of
that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.</p>
<p>Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the
king he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house
and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard
(which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and land
(worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to
Harvey and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down
cellar. So these two frauds said they’d go and fetch it up, and have
everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle. We
shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they spilt
it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them yaller-boys.
My, the way the king’s eyes did shine! He slaps the duke on the shoulder
and says:</p>
<p>“Oh, THIS ain’t bully nor noth’n! Oh, no, I reckon not! Why, Billy,
it beats the Nonesuch, DON’T it?“</p>
<p>The duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them
through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the
king says:</p>
<p>“It ain’t no use talkin’; bein’ brothers to a rich dead man and
representatives of furrin heirs that’s got left is the line for you and
me, Bilge. Thish yer comes of trust’n to Providence. It’s the best way,
in the long run. I’ve tried ‘em all, and ther’ ain’t no better way.“</p>
<p>Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on
trust; but no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out
four hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king:</p>
<p>“Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
dollars?“</p>
<p>They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. Then
the duke says:</p>
<p>“Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake–I
reckon that’s the way of it. The best way’s to let it go, and keep still
about it. We can spare it.“</p>
<p>“Oh, shucks, yes, we can SPARE it. I don’t k’yer noth’n ‘bout
that–it’s the COUNT I’m thinkin’ about. We want to be awful square and
open and above-board here, you know. We want to lug this h-yer money up
stairs and count it before everybody–then ther’ ain’t noth’n suspicious.
But when the dead man says ther’s six thous’n dollars, you know, we
don’t want to–“</p>
<p>“Hold on,“ says the duke. “Le’s make up the deffisit,“ and he begun
to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.</p>
<p>“It’s a most amaz’n’ good idea, duke–you HAVE got a rattlin’ clever
head on you,“ says the king. “Blest if the old Nonesuch ain’t a heppin’
us out agin,“ and HE begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them
up.</p>
<p>It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and
clear.</p>
<p>“Say,“ says the duke, “I got another idea. Le’s go up stairs and
count this money, and then take and GIVE IT TO THE GIRLS.“</p>
<p>“Good land, duke, lemme hug you! It’s the most dazzling idea ‘at ever
a man struck. You have cert’nly got the most astonishin’ head I ever
see. Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther’ ain’t no mistake ’bout it. Let
’em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to–this ’ll lay ’em
out.“</p>
<p>When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the
king he counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a
pile–twenty elegant little piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and
licked their chops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the
king begin to swell himself up for another speech. He says:</p>
<p>“Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by
them that’s left behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done generous by
these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that’s left
fatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowed him knows that he
would a done MORE generous by ‘em if he hadn’t ben afeard o’ woundin’
his dear William and me. Now, WOULDN’T he? Ther’ ain’t no question ‘bout
it in MY mind. Well, then, what kind o’ brothers would it be that ‘d
stand in his way at sech a time? And what kind o’ uncles would it be
that ’d rob–yes, ROB–sech poor sweet lambs as these ’at he loved so at
sech a time? If I know William–and I THINK I do–he–well, I’ll jest ask
him.“ He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with
his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed a
while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning, and jumps for
the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy, and hugs him about
fifteen times before he lets up. Then the king says, “I knowed it; I
reckon THAT ’ll convince anybody the way HE feels about it. Here, Mary
Jane, Susan, Joanner, take the money–take it ALL. It’s the gift of him
that lays yonder, cold but joyful.“</p>
<p>Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke,
and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And everybody
crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of
them frauds, saying all the time:</p>
<p>“You DEAR good souls!–how LOVELY!–how COULD you!“</p>
<p>Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased
again, and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and
before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,
and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody
saying anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was
all busy listening. The king was saying–in the middle of something he’d
started in on–</p>
<p>“–they bein’ partickler friends o’ the diseased. That’s why they’re
invited here this evenin’; but tomorrow we want ALL to come–everybody;
for he respected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it’s fitten that
his funeral orgies sh’d be public.“</p>
<p>And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and
every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke
he couldn’t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,
“OBSEQUIES, you old fool,“ and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and
reaching it over people’s heads to him. The king he reads it and puts it
in his pocket, and says:</p>
<p>“Poor William, afflicted as he is, his HEART’S aluz right. Asks me to
invite everybody to come to the funeral–wants me to make ’em all
welcome. But he needn’t a worried–it was jest what I was at.“</p>
<p>Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca’m, and goes to dropping in
his funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.
And when he done it the third time he says:</p>
<p>“I say orgies, not because it’s the common term, because it ain’t
–obsequies bein’ the common term–but because orgies is the right term.
Obsequies ain’t used in England no more now–it’s gone out. We say orgies
now in England. Orgies is better, because it means the thing you’re
after more exact. It’s a word that’s made up out’n the Greek ORGO,
outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew JEESUM, to plant, cover up; hence
inTER. So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public funeral.“</p>
<p>He was the WORST I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed
right in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody says, “Why, DOCTOR!“
and Abner Shackleford says:</p>
<p>“Why, Robinson, hain’t you heard the news? This is Harvey Wilks.“</p>
<p>The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:</p>
<p>“Is it my poor brother’s dear good friend and physician? I–“</p>
<p>“Keep your hands off of me!“ says the doctor. “YOU talk like an
Englishman, DON’T you? It’s the worst imitation I ever heard. YOU Peter
Wilks’s brother! You’re a fraud, that’s what you are!“</p>
<p>Well, how they all took on! They crowded around the doctor and tried
to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey
’d showed in forty ways that he WAS Harvey, and knowed everybody by
name, and the names of the very dogs, and begged and BEGGED him not to
hurt Harvey’s feelings and the poor girl’s feelings, and all that. But
it warn’t no use; he stormed right along, and said any man that
pretended to be an Englishman and couldn’t imitate the lingo no better
than what he did was a fraud and a liar. The poor girls was hanging to
the king and crying; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on
THEM. He says:</p>
<p>“I was your father’s friend, and I’m your friend; and I warn you as a
friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing
to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew,
as he calls it. He is the thinnest kind of an impostor–has come here
with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres, and
you take them for PROOFS, and are helped to fool yourselves by these
foolish friends here, who ought to know better. Mary Jane Wilks, you
know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend, too. Now listen
to me; turn this pitiful rascal out–I BEG you to do it. Will you?“</p>
<p>Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! She
says:</p>
<p>“HERE is my answer.“ She hove up the bag of money and put it in the
king’s hands, and says, “Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for
me and my sisters any way you want to, and don’t give us no receipt for
it.“</p>
<p>Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the
hare-lip done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands and
stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his
head and smiled proud. The doctor says:</p>
<p>“All right; I wash MY hands of the matter. But I warn you all that a
time ’s coming when you’re going to feel sick whenever you think of this
day.“ And away he went.</p>
<p>“All right, doctor,“ says the king, kinder mocking him; “we’ll try
and get ’em to send for you;“ which made them all laugh, and they said
it was a prime good hit.</p>
