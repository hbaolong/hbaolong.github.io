<h4 id="chapter-xxxviii.">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h4>
<p>Prosperity is the best protector of principle. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s
New Calendar.</p>
<p>EVENING–11th. Sailed in the Rosetta. This is a poor old ship, and
ought to be insured and sunk. As in the ‘Oceana’, just so here:
everybody dresses for dinner; they make it a sort of pious duty. These
fine and formal costumes are a rather conspicuous contrast to the
poverty and shabbiness of the surroundings . . . . If you want a slice
of a lime at four o’clock tea, you must sign an order on the bar. Limes
cost 14 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>January 18th. We have been running up the Arabian Sea, latterly.
Closing up on Bombay now, and due to arrive this evening.</p>
<p>January 20th. Bombay! A bewitching place, a bewildering place, an
enchanting place–the Arabian Nights come again? It is a vast city;
contains about a million inhabitants. Natives, they are, with a slight
sprinkling of white people–not enough to have the slightest modifying
effect upon the massed dark complexion of the public. It is winter here,
yet the weather is the divine weather of June, and the foliage is the
fresh and heavenly foliage of June. There is a rank of noble great shade
trees across the way from the hotel, and under them sit groups of
picturesque natives of both sexes; and the juggler in his turban is
there with his snakes and his magic; and all day long the cabs and the
multitudinous varieties of costumes flock by. It does not seem as if one
could ever get tired of watching this moving show, this shining and
shifting spectacle . . . . In the great bazar the pack and jam of
natives was marvelous, the sea of rich-colored turbans and draperies an
inspiring sight, and the quaint and showy Indian architecture was just
the right setting for it. Toward sunset another show; this is the drive
around the sea-shore to Malabar Point, where Lord Sandhurst, the
Governor of the Bombay Presidency, lives. Parsee palaces all along the
first part of the drive; and past them all the world is driving; the
private carriages of wealthy Englishmen and natives of rank are manned
by a driver and three footmen in stunning oriental liveries–two of these
turbaned statues standing up behind, as fine as monuments. Sometimes
even the public carriages have this superabundant crew, slightly
modified–one to drive, one to sit by and see it done, and one to stand
up behind and yell–yell when there is anybody in the way, and for
practice when there isn’t. It all helps to keep up the liveliness and
augment the general sense of swiftness and energy and confusion and
pow-wow.</p>
<p>In the region of Scandal Point–felicitous name–where there are handy
rocks to sit on and a noble view of the sea on the one hand, and on the
other the passing and reprising whirl and tumult of gay carriages, are
great groups of comfortably-off Parsee women–perfect flower-beds of
brilliant color, a fascinating spectacle. Tramp, tramp, tramping along
the road, in singles, couples, groups, and gangs, you have the
working-man and the working-woman–but not clothed like ours. Usually the
man is a nobly-built great athlete, with not a rag on but his
loin-handkerchief; his color a deep dark brown, his skin satin, his
rounded muscles knobbing it as if it had eggs under it. Usually the
woman is a slender and shapely creature, as erect as a lightning-rod,
and she has but one thing on–a bright-colored piece of stuff which is
wound about her head and her body down nearly half-way to her knees, and
which clings like her own skin. Her legs and feet are bare, and so are
her arms, except for her fanciful bunches of loose silver rings on her
ankles and on her arms. She has jewelry bunched on the side of her nose
also, and showy clusterings on her toes. When she undresses for bed she
takes off her jewelry, I suppose. If she took off anything more she
would catch cold. As a rule she has a large shiney brass water jar of
graceful shape on her head, and one of her naked arms curves up and the
hand holds it there. She is so straight, so erect, and she steps with
such style, and such easy grace and dignity; and her curved arm and her
brazen jar are such a help to the picture indeed, our working-women
cannot begin with her as a road-decoration.</p>
<p>It is all color, bewitching color, enchanting color–everywhere all
around–all the way around the curving great opaline bay clear to
Government House, where the turbaned big native ‘chuprassies’ stand
grouped in state at the door in their robes of fiery red, and do most
properly and stunningly finish up the splendid show and make it
theatrically complete. I wish I were a ‘chuprassy’.</p>
<p>This is indeed India! the land of dreams and romance, of fabulous
wealth and fabulous poverty, of splendor and rags, of palaces and
hovels, of famine and pestilence, of genii and giants and Aladdin lamps,
of tigers and elephants, the cobra and the jungle, the country of a
hundred nations and a hundred tongues, of a thousand religions and two
million gods, cradle of the human race, birthplace of human speech,
mother of history, grandmother of legend, great-grandmother of
tradition, whose yesterdays bear date with the mouldering antiquities of
the rest of the nations–the one sole country under the sun that is
endowed with an imperishable interest for alien prince and alien
peasant, for lettered and ignorant, wise and fool, rich and poor, bond
and free, the one land that all men desire to see, and having seen once,
by even a glimpse, would not give that glimpse for the shows of all the
rest of the globe combined. Even now, after the lapse of a year, the
delirium of those days in Bombay has not left me, and I hope never will.
It was all new, no detail of it hackneyed. And India did not wait for
morning, it began at the hotel –straight away. The lobbies and halls
were full of turbaned, and fez’d and embroidered, cap’d, and barefooted,
and cotton-clad dark natives, some of them rushing about, others at rest
squatting, or sitting on the ground; some of them chattering with
energy, others still and dreamy; in the dining-room every man’s own
private native servant standing behind his chair, and dressed for a part
in the Arabian Nights.</p>
<p>Our rooms were high up, on the front. A white man–he was a burly
German –went up with us, and brought three natives along to see to
arranging things. About fourteen others followed in procession, with the
hand-baggage; each carried an article–and only one; a bag, in some
cases, in other cases less. One strong native carried my overcoat,
another a parasol, another a box of cigars, another a novel, and the
last man in the procession had no load but a fan. It was all done with
earnestness and sincerity, there was not a smile in the procession from
the head of it to the tail of it. Each man waited patiently, tranquilly,
in no sort of hurry, till one of us found time to give him a copper,
then he bent his head reverently, touched his forehead with his fingers,
and went his way. They seemed a soft and gentle race, and there was
something both winning and touching about their demeanor.</p>
<p>There was a vast glazed door which opened upon the balcony. It needed
closing, or cleaning, or something, and a native got down on his knees
and went to work at it. He seemed to be doing it well enough, but
perhaps he wasn’t, for the burly German put on a look that betrayed
dissatisfaction, then without explaining what was wrong, gave the native
a brisk cuff on the jaw and then told him where the defect was. It
seemed such a shame to do that before us all. The native took it with
meekness, saying nothing, and not showing in his face or manner any
resentment. I had not seen the like of this for fifty years. It carried
me back to my boyhood, and flashed upon me the forgotten fact that this
was the usual way of explaining one’s desires to a slave. I was able to
remember that the method seemed right and natural to me in those days, I
being born to it and unaware that elsewhere there were other methods;
but I was also able to remember that those unresented cuffings made me
sorry for the victim and ashamed for the punisher. My father was a
refined and kindly gentleman, very grave, rather austere, of rigid
probity, a sternly just and upright man, albeit he attended no church
and never spoke of religious matters, and had no part nor lot in the
pious joys of his Presbyterian family, nor ever seemed to suffer from
this deprivation. He laid his hand upon me in punishment only twice in
his life, and then not heavily; once for telling him a lie–which
surprised me, and showed me how unsuspicious he was, for that was not my
maiden effort. He punished me those two times only, and never any other
member of the family at all; yet every now and then he cuffed our
harmless slave boy, Lewis, for trifling little blunders and
awkwardnesses. My father had passed his life among the slaves from his
cradle up, and his cuffings proceeded from the custom of the time, not
from his nature. When I was ten years old I saw a man fling a lump of
iron-ore at a slaveman in anger, for merely doing something awkwardly–as
if that were a crime. It bounded from the man’s skull, and the man fell
and never spoke again. He was dead in an hour. I knew the man had a
right to kill his slave if he wanted to, and yet it seemed a pitiful
thing and somehow wrong, though why wrong I was not deep enough to
explain if I had been asked to do it. Nobody in the village approved of
that murder, but of course no one said much about it.</p>
<p>It is curious–the space-annihilating power of thought. For just one
second, all that goes to make the me in me was in a Missourian village,
on the other side of the globe, vividly seeing again these forgotten
pictures of fifty years ago, and wholly unconscious of all things but
just those; and in the next second I was back in Bombay, and that
kneeling native’s smitten cheek was not done tingling yet! Back to
boyhood–fifty years; back to age again, another fifty; and a flight
equal to the circumference of the globe-all in two seconds by the
watch!</p>
<p>Some natives–I don’t remember how many–went into my bedroom, now, and
put things to rights and arranged the mosquito-bar, and I went to bed to
nurse my cough. It was about nine in the evening. What a state of
things! For three hours the yelling and shouting of natives in the hall
continued, along with the velvety patter of their swift bare feet–what a
racket it was! They were yelling orders and messages down three flights.
Why, in the matter of noise it amounted to a riot, an insurrection, a
revolution. And then there were other noises mixed up with these and at
intervals tremendously accenting them–roofs falling in, I judged,
windows smashing, persons being murdered, crows squawking, and deriding,
and cursing, canaries screeching, monkeys jabbering, macaws blaspheming,
and every now and then fiendish bursts of laughter and explosions of
dynamite. By midnight I had suffered all the different kinds of shocks
there are, and knew that I could never more be disturbed by them, either
isolated or in combination. Then came peace–stillness deep and solemn
and lasted till five.</p>
<p>Then it all broke loose again. And who re-started it? The Bird of
Birds the Indian crow. I came to know him well, by and by, and be
infatuated with him. I suppose he is the hardest lot that wears
feathers. Yes, and the cheerfulest, and the best satisfied with himself.
He never arrived at what he is by any careless process, or any sudden
one; he is a work of art, and “art is long“; he is the product of
immemorial ages, and of deep calculation; one can’t make a bird like
that in a day. He has been reincarnated more times than Shiva; and he
has kept a sample of each incarnation, and fused it into his
constitution. In the course of his evolutionary promotions, his sublime
march toward ultimate perfection, he has been a gambler, a low comedian,
a dissolute priest, a fussy woman, a blackguard, a scoffer, a liar, a
thief, a spy, an informer, a trading politician, a swindler, a
professional hypocrite, a patriot for cash, a reformer, a lecturer, a
lawyer, a conspirator, a rebel, a royalist, a democrat, a practicer and
propagator of irreverence, a meddler, an intruder, a busybody, an
infidel, and a wallower in sin for the mere love of it. The strange
result, the incredible result, of this patient accumulation of all
damnable traits is, that be does not know what care is, he does not know
what sorrow is, he does not know what remorse is, his life is one long
thundering ecstasy of happiness, and he will go to his death untroubled,
knowing that he will soon turn up again as an author or something, and
be even more intolerably capable and comfortable than ever he was
before.</p>
<p>In his straddling wide forward-step, and his springy side-wise series
of hops, and his impudent air, and his cunning way of canting his head
to one side upon occasion, he reminds one of the American blackbird. But
the sharp resemblances stop there. He is much bigger than the blackbird;
and he lacks the blackbird’s trim and slender and beautiful build and
shapely beak; and of course his sober garb of gray and rusty black is a
poor and humble thing compared with the splendid lustre of the
blackbird’s metallic sables and shifting and flashing bronze glories.
The blackbird is a perfect gentleman, in deportment and attire, and is
not noisy, I believe, except when holding religious services and
political conventions in a tree; but this Indian sham Quaker is just a
rowdy, and is always noisy when awake–always chaffing, scolding,
scoffing, laughing, ripping, and cursing, and carrying on about
something or other. I never saw such a bird for delivering opinions.
Nothing escapes him; he notices everything that happens, and brings out
his opinion about it, particularly if it is a matter that is none of his
business. And it is never a mild opinion, but always violent–violent and
profane–the presence of ladies does not affect him. His opinions are not
the outcome of reflection, for he never thinks about anything, but
heaves out the opinion that is on top in his mind, and which is often an
opinion about some quite different thing and does not fit the case. But
that is his way; his main idea is to get out an opinion, and if he
stopped to think he would lose chances.</p>
<p>I suppose he has no enemies among men. The whites and Mohammedans
never seemed to molest him; and the Hindoos, because of their religion,
never take the life of any creature, but spare even the snakes and
tigers and fleas and rats. If I sat on one end of the balcony, the crows
would gather on the railing at the other end and talk about me; and edge
closer, little by little, till I could almost reach them; and they would
sit there, in the most unabashed way, and talk about my clothes, and my
hair, and my complexion, and probable character and vocation and
politics, and how I came to be in India, and what I had been doing, and
how many days I had got for it, and how I had happened to go unhanged so
long, and when would it probably come off, and might there be more of my
sort where I came from, and when would they be hanged,–and so on, and so
on, until I could not longer endure the embarrassment of it; then I
would shoo them away, and they would circle around in the air a little
while, laughing and deriding and mocking, and presently settle on the
rail and do it all over again.</p>
<p>They were very sociable when there was anything to eat–oppressively
so. With a little encouragement they would come in and light on the
table and help me eat my breakfast; and once when I was in the other
room and they found themselves alone, they carried off everything they
could lift; and they were particular to choose things which they could
make no use of after they got them. In India their number is beyond
estimate, and their noise is in proportion. I suppose they cost the
country more than the government does; yet that is not a light matter.
Still, they pay; their company pays; it would sadden the land to take
their cheerful voice out of it.</p>
