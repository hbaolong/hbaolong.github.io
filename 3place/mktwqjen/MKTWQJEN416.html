<h4 id="chapter-33-refreshments-and-ethics">Chapter 33 Refreshments and
Ethics</h4>
<p>IN regard to Island 74, which is situated not far from the former
Napoleon, a freak of the river here has sorely perplexed the laws of men
and made them a vanity and a jest. When the State of Arkansas was
chartered, she controlled ‘to the center of the river’–a most unstable
line. The State of Mississippi claimed ‘to the channel’–another shifty
and unstable line. No. 74 belonged to Arkansas. By and by a cut-off
threw this big island out of Arkansas, and yet not within Mississippi.
‘Middle of the river’ on one side of it, ‘channel’ on the other. That is
as I understand the problem. Whether I have got the details right or
wrong, this FACT remains: that here is this big and exceedingly valuable
island of four thousand acres, thrust out in the cold, and belonging to
neither the one State nor the other; paying taxes to neither, owing
allegiance to neither. One man owns the whole island, and of right is
‘the man without a country.’</p>
<p>Island 92 belongs to Arkansas. The river moved it over and joined it
to Mississippi. A chap established a whiskey shop there, without a
Mississippi license, and enriched himself upon Mississippi custom under
Arkansas protection (where no license was in those days required).</p>
<p>We glided steadily down the river in the usual privacy–steamboat or
other moving thing seldom seen. Scenery as always: stretch upon stretch
of almost unbroken forest, on both sides of the river; soundless
solitude. Here and there a cabin or two, standing in small openings on
the gray and grassless banks–cabins which had formerly stood a quarter
or half-mile farther to the front, and gradually been pulled farther and
farther back as the shores caved in. As at Pilcher’s Point, for
instance, where the cabins had been moved back three hundred yards in
three months, so we were told; but the caving banks had already caught
up with them, and they were being conveyed rearward once more.</p>
<p>Napoleon had but small opinion of Greenville, Mississippi, in the old
times; but behold, Napoleon is gone to the cat-fishes, and here is
Greenville full of life and activity, and making a considerable flourish
in the Valley; having three thousand inhabitants, it is said, and doing
a gross trade of ,500,000 annually. A growing town.</p>
<p>There was much talk on the boat about the Calhoun Land Company, an
enterprise which is expected to work wholesome results. Colonel Calhoun,
a grandson of the statesman, went to Boston and formed a syndicate which
purchased a large tract of land on the river, in Chicot County,
Arkansas–some ten thousand acres–for cotton-growing. The purpose is to
work on a cash basis: buy at first hands, and handle their own product;
supply their negro laborers with provisions and necessaries at a
trifling profit, say 8 or 10 per cent.; furnish them comfortable
quarters, etc., and encourage them to save money and remain on the
place. If this proves a financial success, as seems quite certain, they
propose to establish a banking-house in Greenville, and lend money at an
unburdensome rate of interest–6 per cent. is spoken of.</p>
<p>The trouble heretofore has been–I am quoting remarks of planters and
steamboatmen–that the planters, although owning the land, were without
cash capital; had to hypothecate both land and crop to carry on the
business. Consequently, the commission dealer who furnishes the money
takes some risk and demands big interest–usually 10 per cent., and
2{half} per cent. for negotiating the loan. The planter has also to buy
his supplies through the same dealer, paying commissions and profits.
Then when he ships his crop, the dealer adds his commissions, insurance,
etc. So, taking it by and large, and first and last, the dealer’s share
of that crop is about 25 per cent.’{footnote [‘But what can the State do
where the people are under subjection to rates of interest ranging from
18 to 30 per cent., and are also under the necessity of purchasing their
crops in advance even of planting, at these rates, for the privilege of
purchasing all their supplies at 100 per cent. profit?’–EDWARD
ATKINSON.]}</p>
<p>A cotton-planter’s estimate of the average margin of profit on
planting, in his section: One man and mule will raise ten acres of
cotton, giving ten bales cotton, worth, say, 00; cost of producing, say
50; net profit, 50, or 5 per acre. There is also a profit now from the
cotton-seed, which formerly had little value–none where much
transportation was necessary. In sixteen hundred pounds crude cotton
four hundred are lint, worth, say, ten cents a pound; and twelve hundred
pounds of seed, worth 2 or 3 per ton. Maybe in future even the stems
will not be thrown away. Mr. Edward Atkinson says that for each bale of
cotton there are fifteen hundred pounds of stems, and that these are
very rich in phosphate of lime and potash; that when ground and mixed
with ensilage or cotton-seed meal (which is too rich for use as fodder
in large quantities), the stem mixture makes a superior food, rich in
all the elements needed for the production of milk, meat, and bone.
Heretofore the stems have been considered a nuisance.</p>
<p>Complaint is made that the planter remains grouty toward the former
slave, since the war; will have nothing but a chill business relation
with him, no sentiment permitted to intrude, will not keep a ‘store’
himself, and supply the negro’s wants and thus protect the negro’s
pocket and make him able and willing to stay on the place and an
advantage to him to do it, but lets that privilege to some thrifty
Israelite, who encourages the thoughtless negro and wife to buy all
sorts of things which they could do without–buy on credit, at big
prices, month after month, credit based on the negro’s share of the
growing crop; and at the end of the season, the negro’s share belongs to
the Israelite,’ the negro is in debt besides, is discouraged,
dissatisfied, restless, and both he and the planter are injured; for he
will take steamboat and migrate, and the planter must get a stranger in
his place who does not know him, does not care for him, will fatten the
Israelite a season, and follow his predecessor per steamboat.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the Calhoun Company will show, by its humane and
protective treatment of its laborers, that its method is the most
profitable for both planter and negro; and it is believed that a general
adoption of that method will then follow.</p>
<p>And where so many are saying their say, shall not the barkeeper
testify? He is thoughtful, observant, never drinks; endeavors to earn
his salary, and WOULD earn it if there were custom enough. He says the
people along here in Mississippi and Louisiana will send up the river to
buy vegetables rather than raise them, and they will come aboard at the
landings and buy fruits of the barkeeper. Thinks they ‘don’t know
anything but cotton;’ believes they don’t know how to raise vegetables
and fruit–‘at least the most of them.’ Says ‘a nigger will go to H for a
watermelon’ (‘H’ is all I find in the stenographer’s report–means
Halifax probably, though that seems a good way to go for a watermelon).
Barkeeper buys watermelons for five cents up the river, brings them down
and sells them for fifty. ‘Why does he mix such elaborate and
picturesque drinks for the nigger hands on the boat?’ Because they won’t
have any other. ‘They want a big drink; don’t make any difference what
you make it of, they want the worth of their money. You give a nigger a
plain gill of half-a-dollar brandy for five cents–will he touch it?
No. Ain’t size enough to it. But you put up a pint of all kinds of
worthless rubbish, and heave in some red stuff to make it
beautiful–red’s the main thing–and he wouldn’t put down that glass to go
to a circus.’ All the bars on this Anchor Line are rented and owned by
one firm. They furnish the liquors from their own establishment, and
hire the barkeepers ‘on salary.’ Good liquors? Yes, on some of the
boats, where there are the kind of passengers that want it and can pay
for it. On the other boats? No. Nobody but the deck hands and firemen to
drink it. ‘Brandy? Yes, I’ve got brandy, plenty of it; but you don’t
want any of it unless you’ve made your will.’ It isn’t as it used to be
in the old times. Then everybody traveled by steamboat, everybody drank,
and everybody treated everybody else. ‘Now most everybody goes by
railroad, and the rest don’t drink.’ In the old times the barkeeper
owned the bar himself, ‘and was gay and smarty and talky and all jeweled
up, and was the toniest aristocrat on the boat; used to make ,000 on a
trip. A father who left his son a steamboat bar, left him a fortune. Now
he leaves him board and lodging; yes, and washing, if a shirt a trip
will do. Yes, indeedy, times are changed. Why, do you know, on the
principal line of boats on the Upper Mississippi, they don’t have any
bar at all! Sounds like poetry, but it’s the petrified truth.’</p>
