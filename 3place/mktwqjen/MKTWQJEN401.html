<h4 id="chapter-18-i-take-a-few-extra-lessons">Chapter 18 I Take a Few
Extra Lessons</h4>
<p>DURING the two or two and a half years of my apprenticeship, I served
under many pilots, and had experience of many kinds of steamboatmen and
many varieties of steamboats; for it was not always convenient for
Mr. Bixby to have me with him, and in such cases he sent me with
somebody else. I am to this day profiting somewhat by that experience;
for in that brief, sharp schooling, I got personally and familiarly
acquainted with about all the different types of human nature that are
to be found in fiction, biography, or history. The fact is daily borne
in upon me, that the average shore-employment requires as much as forty
years to equip a man with this sort of an education. When I say I am
still profiting by this thing, I do not mean that it has constituted me
a judge of men–no, it has not done that; for judges of men are born, not
made. My profit is various in kind and degree; but the feature of it
which I value most is the zest which that early experience has given to
my later reading. When I find a well-drawn character in fiction or
biography, I generally take a warm personal interest in him, for the
reason that I have known him before–met him on the river.</p>
<p>The figure that comes before me oftenest, out of the shadows of that
vanished time, is that of Brown, of the steamer ‘Pennsylvania’–the man
referred to in a former chapter, whose memory was so good and tiresome.
He was a middle-aged, long, slim, bony, smooth-shaven, horse-faced,
ignorant, stingy, malicious, snarling, fault hunting, mote-magnifying
tyrant. I early got the habit of coming on watch with dread at my heart.
No matter how good a time I might have been having with the off-watch
below, and no matter how high my spirits might be when I started aloft,
my soul became lead in my body the moment I approached the
pilot-house.</p>
<p>I still remember the first time I ever entered the presence of that
man. The boat had backed out from St. Louis and was ‘straightening
down;’ I ascended to the pilot-house in high feather, and very proud to
be semi- officially a member of the executive family of so fast and
famous a boat. Brown was at the wheel. I paused in the middle of the
room, all fixed to make my bow, but Brown did not look around. I thought
he took a furtive glance at me out of the corner of his eye, but as not
even this notice was repeated, I judged I had been mistaken. By this
time he was picking his way among some dangerous ‘breaks’ abreast the
woodyards; therefore it would not be proper to interrupt him; so I
stepped softly to the high bench and took a seat.</p>
<p>There was silence for ten minutes; then my new boss turned and
inspected me deliberately and painstakingly from head to heel for
about–as it seemed to me–a quarter of an hour. After which he removed
his countenance and I saw it no more for some seconds; then it came
around once more, and this question greeted me–</p>
<p>‘Are you Horace Bigsby’s cub?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>
<p>After this there was a pause and another inspection. Then–</p>
<p>‘What’s your name?’</p>
<p>I told him. He repeated it after me. It was probably the only thing
he ever forgot; for although I was with him many months he never
addressed himself to me in any other way than ‘Here!’ and then his
command followed.</p>
<p>‘Where was you born?’</p>
<p>‘In Florida, Missouri.’</p>
<p>A pause. Then–</p>
<p>‘Dern sight better staid there!’</p>
<p>By means of a dozen or so of pretty direct questions, he pumped my
family history out of me.</p>
<p>The leads were going now, in the first crossing. This interrupted the
inquest. When the leads had been laid in, he resumed–</p>
<p>‘How long you been on the river?’</p>
<p>I told him. After a pause–</p>
<p>‘Where’d you get them shoes?’</p>
<p>I gave him the information.</p>
<p>‘Hold up your foot!’</p>
<p>I did so. He stepped back, examined the shoe minutely and
contemptuously, scratching his head thoughtfully, tilting his high
sugar-loaf hat well forward to facilitate the operation, then
ejaculated, ‘Well, I’ll be dod derned!’ and returned to his wheel.</p>
<p>What occasion there was to be dod derned about it is a thing which is
still as much of a mystery to me now as it was then. It must have been
all of fifteen minutes–fifteen minutes of dull, homesick silence– before
that long horse-face swung round upon me again–and then, what a change!
It was as red as fire, and every muscle in it was working. Now came this
shriek–</p>
<p>‘Here!–You going to set there all day?’</p>
<p>I lit in the middle of the floor, shot there by the electric
suddenness of the surprise. As soon as I could get my voice I said,
apologetically:–‘I have had no orders, sir.’</p>
<p>‘You’ve had no ORDERS! My, what a fine bird we are! We must have
ORDERS! Our father was a GENTLEMAN–owned slaves–and we’ve been to
SCHOOL. Yes, WE are a gentleman, TOO, and got to have ORDERS! ORDERS, is
it? ORDERS is what you want! Dod dern my skin, I’LL learn you to swell
yourself up and blow around here about your dod-derned ORDERS! G’way
from the wheel!’ (I had approached it without knowing it.)</p>
<p>I moved back a step or two, and stood as in a dream, all my senses
stupefied by this frantic assault.</p>
<p>‘What you standing there for? Take that ice-pitcher down to the
texas- tender-come, move along, and don’t you be all day about it!’</p>
<p>The moment I got back to the pilot-house, Brown said–</p>
<p>‘Here! What was you doing down there all this time?’</p>
<p>‘I couldn’t find the texas-tender; I had to go all the way to the
pantry.’</p>
<p>‘Derned likely story! Fill up the stove.’</p>
<p>I proceeded to do so. He watched me like a cat. Presently he
shouted–</p>
<p>‘Put down that shovel! Deadest numskull I ever saw–ain’t even got
sense enough to load up a stove.’</p>
<p>All through the watch this sort of thing went on. Yes, and the
subsequent watches were much like it, during a stretch of months. As I
have said, I soon got the habit of coming on duty with dread. The moment
I was in the presence, even in the darkest night, I could feel those
yellow eyes upon me, and knew their owner was watching for a pretext to
spit out some venom on me. Preliminarily he would say–</p>
<p>‘Here! Take the wheel.’</p>
<p>Two minutes later–</p>
<p>‘WHERE in the nation you going to? Pull her down! pull her down!’</p>
<p>After another moment–</p>
<p>‘Say! You going to hold her all day? Let her go–meet her! meet
her!’</p>
<p>Then he would jump from the bench, snatch the wheel from me, and meet
her himself, pouring out wrath upon me all the time.</p>
<p>George Ritchie was the other pilot’s cub. He was having good times
now; for his boss, George Ealer, was as kindhearted as Brown wasn’t.
Ritchie had steeled for Brown the season before; consequently he knew
exactly how to entertain himself and plague me, all by the one
operation. Whenever I took the wheel for a moment on Ealer’s watch,
Ritchie would sit back on the bench and play Brown, with continual
ejaculations of ‘Snatch her! snatch her! Derndest mud-cat I ever saw!’
‘Here! Where you going NOW? Going to run over that snag?’ ‘Pull her
DOWN! Don’t you hear me? Pull her DOWN!’ ‘There she goes! JUST as I
expected! I TOLD you not to cramp that reef. G’way from the wheel!’</p>
<p>So I always had a rough time of it, no matter whose watch it was; and
sometimes it seemed to me that Ritchie’s good-natured badgering was
pretty nearly as aggravating as Brown’s dead-earnest nagging.</p>
<p>I often wanted to kill Brown, but this would not answer. A cub had to
take everything his boss gave, in the way of vigorous comment and
criticism; and we all believed that there was a United States law making
it a penitentiary offense to strike or threaten a pilot who was on duty.
However, I could IMAGINE myself killing Brown; there was no law against
that; and that was the thing I used always to do the moment I was abed.
Instead of going over my river in my mind as was my duty, I threw
business aside for pleasure, and killed Brown. I killed Brown every
night for months; not in old, stale, commonplace ways, but in new and
picturesque ones;–ways that were sometimes surprising for freshness of
design and ghastliness of situation and environment.</p>
<p>Brown was ALWAYS watching for a pretext to find fault; and if he
could find no plausible pretext, he would invent one. He would scold you
for shaving a shore, and for not shaving it; for hugging a bar, and for
not hugging it; for ‘pulling down’ when not invited, and for not pulling
down when not invited; for firing up without orders, and for waiting FOR
orders. In a word, it was his invariable rule to find fault with
EVERYTHING you did; and another invariable rule of his was to throw all
his remarks (to you) into the form of an insult.</p>
<p>One day we were approaching New Madrid, bound down and heavily laden.
Brown was at one side of the wheel, steering; I was at the other,
standing by to ‘pull down’ or ‘shove up.’ He cast a furtive glance at me
every now and then. I had long ago learned what that meant; viz., he was
trying to invent a trap for me. I wondered what shape it was going to
take. By and by he stepped back from the wheel and said in his usual
snarly way–</p>
<p>‘Here!–See if you’ve got gumption enough to round her to.’</p>
<p>This was simply BOUND to be a success; nothing could prevent it; for
he had never allowed me to round the boat to before; consequently, no
matter how I might do the thing, he could find free fault with it. He
stood back there with his greedy eye on me, and the result was what
might have been foreseen: I lost my head in a quarter of a minute, and
didn’t know what I was about; I started too early to bring the boat
around, but detected a green gleam of joy in Brown’s eye, and corrected
my mistake; I started around once more while too high up, but corrected
myself again in time; I made other false moves, and still managed to
save myself; but at last I grew so confused and anxious that I tumbled
into the very worst blunder of all–I got too far down before beginning
to fetch the boat around. Brown’s chance was come.</p>
<p>His face turned red with passion; he made one bound, hurled me across
the house with a sweep of his arm, spun the wheel down, and began to
pour out a stream of vituperation upon me which lasted till he was out
of breath. In the course of this speech he called me all the different
kinds of hard names he could think of, and once or twice I thought he
was even going to swear–but he didn’t this time. ‘Dod dern’ was the
nearest he ventured to the luxury of swearing, for he had been brought
up with a wholesome respect for future fire and brimstone.</p>
<p>That was an uncomfortable hour; for there was a big audience on the
hurricane deck. When I went to bed that night, I killed Brown in
seventeen different ways–all of them new.</p>
