<h4 id="chapter-vii.-toms-first-royal-dinner.">Chapter VII. Tom’s first
royal dinner.</h4>
<p>Somewhat after one in the afternoon, Tom resignedly underwent the
ordeal of being dressed for dinner. He found himself as finely clothed
as before, but everything different, everything changed, from his ruff
to his stockings. He was presently conducted with much state to a
spacious and ornate apartment, where a table was already set for one.
Its furniture was all of massy gold, and beautified with designs which
well-nigh made it priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto. The
room was half-filled with noble servitors. A chaplain said grace, and
Tom was about to fall to, for hunger had long been constitutional with
him, but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of Berkeley, who fastened a
napkin about his neck; for the great post of Diaperers to the Prince of
Wales was hereditary in this nobleman’s family. Tom’s cupbearer was
present, and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine. The
Taster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also, prepared to
taste any suspicious dish upon requirement, and run the risk of being
poisoned. He was only an ornamental appendage at this time, and was
seldom called upon to exercise his function; but there had been times,
not many generations past, when the office of taster had its perils, and
was not a grandeur to be desired. Why they did not use a dog or a
plumber seems strange; but all the ways of royalty are strange. My Lord
d’Arcy, First Groom of the Chamber, was there, to do goodness knows
what; but there he was–let that suffice. The Lord Chief Butler was
there, and stood behind Tom’s chair, overseeing the solemnities, under
command of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook, who stood
near. Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants beside these; but
they were not all in that room, of course, nor the quarter of them;
neither was Tom aware yet that they existed.</p>
<p>All those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to
remember that the prince was temporarily out of his head, and to be
careful to show no surprise at his vagaries. These ‘vagaries’ were soon
on exhibition before them; but they only moved their compassion and
their sorrow, not their mirth. It was a heavy affliction to them to see
the beloved prince so stricken.</p>
<p>Poor Tom ate with his fingers mainly; but no one smiled at it, or
even seemed to observe it. He inspected his napkin curiously, and with
deep interest, for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric, then
said with simplicity–</p>
<p>“Prithee, take it away, lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled.“</p>
<p>The Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner, and
without word or protest of any sort.</p>
<p>Tom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest, and asked
what they were, and if they were to be eaten; for it was only recently
that men had begun to raise these things in England in place of
importing them as luxuries from Holland. {1} His question was answered
with grave respect, and no surprise manifested. When he had finished his
dessert, he filled his pockets with nuts; but nobody appeared to be
aware of it, or disturbed by it. But the next moment he was himself
disturbed by it, and showed discomposure; for this was the only service
he had been permitted to do with his own hands during the meal, and he
did not doubt that he had done a most improper and unprincely thing. At
that moment the muscles of his nose began to twitch, and the end of that
organ to lift and wrinkle. This continued, and Tom began to evince a
growing distress. He looked appealingly, first at one and then another
of the lords about him, and tears came into his eyes. They sprang
forward with dismay in their faces, and begged to know his trouble. Tom
said with genuine anguish–</p>
<p>“I crave your indulgence: my nose itcheth cruelly. What is the custom
and usage in this emergence? Prithee, speed, for ’tis but a little time
that I can bear it.“</p>
<p>None smiled; but all were sore perplexed, and looked one to the other
in deep tribulation for counsel. But behold, here was a dead wall, and
nothing in English history to tell how to get over it. The Master of
Ceremonies was not present: there was no one who felt safe to venture
upon this uncharted sea, or risk the attempt to solve this solemn
problem. Alas! there was no Hereditary Scratcher. Meantime the tears had
overflowed their banks, and begun to trickle down Tom’s cheeks. His
twitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief. At last
nature broke down the barriers of etiquette: Tom lifted up an inward
prayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief to the
burdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself.</p>
<p>His meal being ended, a lord came and held before him a broad,
shallow, golden dish with fragrant rosewater in it, to cleanse his mouth
and fingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a
napkin for his use. Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two, then
raised it to his lips, and gravely took a draught. Then he returned it
to the waiting lord, and said–</p>
<p>“Nay, it likes me not, my lord: it hath a pretty flavour, but it
wanteth strength.“</p>
<p>This new eccentricity of the prince’s ruined mind made all the hearts
about him ache; but the sad sight moved none to merriment.</p>
<p>Tom’s next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table just
when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and with
uplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of beginning
the blessing. Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done a
thing unusual.</p>
<p>By his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private
cabinet, and left there alone to his own devices. Hanging upon hooks in
the oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel
armour, covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid in
gold. This martial panoply belonged to the true prince–a recent present
from Madam Parr the Queen. Tom put on the greaves, the gauntlets, the
plumed helmet, and such other pieces as he could don without assistance,
and for a while was minded to call for help and complete the matter, but
bethought him of the nuts he had brought away from dinner, and the joy
it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye him, and no Grand
Hereditaries to pester him with undesired services; so he restored the
pretty things to their several places, and soon was cracking nuts, and
feeling almost naturally happy for the first time since God for his sins
had made him a prince. When the nuts were all gone, he stumbled upon
some inviting books in a closet, among them one about the etiquette of
the English court. This was a prize. He lay down upon a sumptuous divan,
and proceeded to instruct himself with honest zeal. Let us leave him
there for the present.</p>
