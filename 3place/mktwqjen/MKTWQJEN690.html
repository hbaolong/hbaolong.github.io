<h4 id="chapter-v.">CHAPTER V.</h4>
<p>Noise proves nothing. Often a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles
as if she had laid an asteroid. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>WEDNESDAY, Sept. 11. In this world we often make mistakes of
judgment. We do not as a rule get out of them sound and whole, but
sometimes we do. At dinner yesterday evening-present, a mixture of
Scotch, English, American, Canadian, and Australasian folk–a discussion
broke out about the pronunciation of certain Scottish words. This was
private ground, and the non-Scotch nationalities, with one exception,
discreetly kept still. But I am not discreet, and I took a hand. I
didn’t know anything about the subject, but I took a hand just to have
something to do. At that moment the word in dispute was the word three.
One Scotchman was claiming that the peasantry of Scotland pronounced it
three, his adversaries claimed that they didn’t–that they pronounced it
‘thraw’. The solitary Scot was having a sultry time of it, so I thought
I would enrich him with my help. In my position I was necessarily quite
impartial, and was equally as well and as ill equipped to fight on the
one side as on the other. So I spoke up and said the peasantry
pronounced the word three, not thraw. It was an error of judgment. There
was a moment of astonished and ominous silence, then weather ensued. The
storm rose and spread in a surprising way, and I was snowed under in a
very few minutes. It was a bad defeat for me–a kind of Waterloo. It
promised to remain so, and I wished I had had better sense than to enter
upon such a forlorn enterprise. But just then I had a saving thought–at
least a thought that offered a chance. While the storm was still raging,
I made up a Scotch couplet, and then spoke up and said:</p>
<p>“Very well, don’t say any more. I confess defeat. I thought I knew,
but I see my mistake. I was deceived by one of your Scotch poets.“</p>
<p>“A Scotch poet! O come! Name him.“</p>
<p>“Robert Burns.“</p>
<p>It is wonderful the power of that name. These men looked doubtful–but
paralyzed, all the same. They were quite silent for a moment; then one
of them said–with the reverence in his voice which is always present in
a Scotchman’s tone when he utters the name.</p>
<p>“Does Robbie Burns say–what does he say?“</p>
<p>“This is what he says:</p>
<p>‘There were nae bairns but only three –Ane at the breast, twa at the
knee.’“</p>
<p>It ended the discussion. There was no man there profane enough,
disloyal enough, to say any word against a thing which Robert Burns had
settled. I shall always honor that great name for the salvation it
brought me in this time of my sore need.</p>
<p>It is my belief that nearly any invented quotation, played with
confidence, stands a good chance to deceive. There are people who think
that honesty is always the best policy. This is a superstition; there
are times when the appearance of it is worth six of it.</p>
<p>We are moving steadily southward-getting further and further down
under the projecting paunch of the globe. Yesterday evening we saw the
Big Dipper and the north star sink below the horizon and disappear from
our world. No, not “we,“ but they. They saw it–somebody saw it–and told
me about it. But it is no matter, I was not caring for those things, I
am tired of them, any way. I think they are well enough, but one doesn’t
want them always hanging around. My interest was all in the Southern
Cross. I had never seen that. I had heard about it all my life, and it
was but natural that I should be burning to see it. No other
constellation makes so much talk. I had nothing against the Big Dipper
–and naturally couldn’t have anything against it, since it is a citizen
of our own sky, and the property of the United States–but I did want it
to move out of the way and give this foreigner a chance. Judging by the
size of the talk which the Southern Cross had made, I supposed it would
need a sky all to itself.</p>
<p>But that was a mistake. We saw the Cross to-night, and it is not
large. Not large, and not strikingly bright. But it was low down toward
the horizon, and it may improve when it gets up higher in the sky. It is
ingeniously named, for it looks just as a cross would look if it looked
like something else. But that description does not describe; it is too
vague, too general, too indefinite. It does after a fashion suggest a
cross across that is out of repair–or out of drawing; not correctly
shaped. It is long, with a short cross-bar, and the cross-bar is canted
out of the straight line.</p>
<p>It consists of four large stars and one little one. The little one is
out of line and further damages the shape. It should have been placed at
the intersection of the stem and the cross-bar. If you do not draw an
imaginary line from star to star it does not suggest a cross–nor
anything in particular.</p>
<p>One must ignore the little star, and leave it out of the
combination–it confuses everything. If you leave it out, then you can
make out of the four stars a sort of cross–out of true; or a sort of
kite–out of true; or a sort of coffin-out of true.</p>
<p>Constellations have always been troublesome things to name. If you
give one of them a fanciful name, it will always refuse to live up to
it; it will always persist in not resembling the thing it has been named
for. Ultimately, to satisfy the public, the fanciful name has to be
discarded for a common-sense one, a manifestly descriptive one. The
Great Bear remained the Great Bear–and unrecognizable as such–for
thousands of years; and people complained about it all the time, and
quite properly; but as soon as it became the property of the United
States, Congress changed it to the Big Dipper, and now every body is
satisfied, and there is no more talk about riots. I would not change the
Southern Cross to the Southern Coffin, I would change it to the Southern
Kite; for up there in the general emptiness is the proper home of a
kite, but not for coffins and crosses and dippers. In a little while,
now–I cannot tell exactly how long it will be–the globe will belong to
the English-speaking race; and of course the skies also. Then the
constellations will be re-organized, and polished up, and re-named–the
most of them “Victoria,“ I reckon, but this one will sail thereafter as
the Southern Kite, or go out of business. Several towns and things, here
and there, have been named for Her Majesty already.</p>
<p>In these past few days we are plowing through a mighty Milky Way of
islands. They are so thick on the map that one would hardly expect to
find room between them for a canoe; yet we seldom glimpse one. Once we
saw the dim bulk of a couple of them, far away, spectral and dreamy
things; members of the Horne-Alofa and Fortuna. On the larger one are
two rival native kings–and they have a time together. They are
Catholics; so are their people. The missionaries there are French
priests.</p>
<p>From the multitudinous islands in these regions the “recruits“ for
the Queensland plantations were formerly drawn; are still drawn from
them, I believe. Vessels fitted up like old-time slavers came here and
carried off the natives to serve as laborers in the great Australian
province. In the beginning it was plain, simple man-stealing, as per
testimony of the missionaries. This has been denied, but not disproven.
Afterward it was forbidden by law to “recruit“ a native without his
consent, and governmental agents were sent in all recruiting vessels to
see that the law was obeyed–which they did, according to the recruiting
people; and which they sometimes didn’t, according to the missionaries.
A man could be lawfully recruited for a three-years term of service; he
could volunteer for another term if he so chose; when his time was up he
could return to his island. And would also have the means to do it; for
the government required the employer to put money in its hands for this
purpose before the recruit was delivered to him.</p>
<p>Captain Wawn was a recruiting ship-master during many years. From his
pleasant book one gets the idea that the recruiting business was quite
popular with the islanders, as a rule. And yet that did not make the
business wholly dull and uninteresting; for one finds rather frequent
little breaks in the monotony of it–like this, for instance:</p>
<p>“The afternoon of our arrival at Leper Island the schooner was lying
almost becalmed under the lee of the lofty central portion of the
island, about three-quarters of a mile from the shore. The boats were in
sight at some distance. The recruiter-boat had run into a small nook on
the rocky coast, under a high bank, above which stood a solitary hut
backed by dense forest. The government agent and mate in the second boat
lay about 400 yards to the westward.</p>
<p>“Suddenly we heard the sound of firing, followed by yells from the
natives on shore, and then we saw the recruiter-boat push out with a
seemingly diminished crew. The mate’s boat pulled quickly up, took her
in tow, and presently brought her alongside, all her own crew being more
or less hurt. It seems the natives had called them into the place on
pretence of friendship. A crowd gathered about the stern of the boat,
and several fellows even got into her. All of a sudden our men were
attacked with clubs and tomahawks. The recruiter escaped the first blows
aimed at him, making play with his fists until he had an opportunity to
draw his revolver. ‘Tom Sayers,’ a Mare man, received a tomahawk blow on
the head which laid the scalp open but did not penetrate his skull,
fortunately. ‘Bobby Towns,’ another Mare boatman, had both his thumbs
cut in warding off blows, one of them being so nearly severed from the
hand that the doctors had to finish the operation. Lihu, a Lifu boy, the
recruiter’s special attendant, was cut and pricked in various places,
but nowhere seriously. Jack, an unlucky Tanna recruit, who had been
engaged to act as boatman, received an arrow through his forearm, the
head of which–apiece of bone seven or eight inches long–was still in the
limb, protruding from both sides, when the boats returned. The recruiter
himself would have got off scot-free had not an arrow pinned one of his
fingers to the loom of the steering-oar just as they were getting off.
The fight had been short but sharp. The enemy lost two men, both shot
dead.“</p>
<p>The truth is, Captain Wawn furnishes such a crowd of instances of
fatal encounters between natives and French and English recruiting-crews
(for the French are in the business for the plantations of New
Caledonia), that one is almost persuaded that recruiting is not
thoroughly popular among the islanders; else why this bristling string
of attacks and bloodcurdling slaughter? The captain lays it all to
“Exeter Hall influence.“ But for the meddling philanthropists, the
native fathers and mothers would be fond of seeing their children carted
into exile and now and then the grave, instead of weeping about it and
trying to kill the kind recruiters.</p>
