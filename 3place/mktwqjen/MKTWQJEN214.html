<h4 id="disgraceful-persecution-of-a-boy">DISGRACEFUL PERSECUTION OF A
BOY</h4>
<p>In San Francisco, the other day, “A well-dressed boy, on his way to
Sunday-school, was arrested and thrown into the city prison for stoning
Chinamen.“</p>
<p>What a commentary is this upon human justice! What sad prominence it
gives to our human disposition to tyrannize over the weak! San Francisco
has little right to take credit to herself for her treatment of this
poor boy. What had the child’s education been? How should he suppose it
was wrong to stone a Chinaman? Before we side against him, along with
outraged San Francisco, let us give him a chance–let us hear the
testimony for the defense.</p>
<p>He was a “well-dressed“ boy, and a Sunday-school scholar, and
therefore the chances are that his parents were intelligent, well-to-do
people, with just enough natural villainy in their composition to make
them yearn after the daily papers, and enjoy them; and so this boy had
opportunities to learn all through the week how to do right, as well as
on Sunday.</p>
<p>It was in this way that he found out that the great commonwealth of
California imposes an unlawful mining-tax upon John the foreigner, and
allows Patrick the foreigner to dig gold for nothing–probably because
the degraded Mongol is at no expense for whisky, and the refined Celt
cannot exist without it.</p>
<p>It was in this way that he found out that a respectable number of the
tax-gatherers–it would be unkind to say all of them–collect the tax
twice, instead of once; and that, inasmuch as they do it solely to
discourage Chinese immigration into the mines, it is a thing that is
much applauded, and likewise regarded as being singularly facetious.</p>
<p>It was in this way that he found out that when a white man robs a
sluice-box (by the term white man is meant Spaniards, Mexicans,
Portuguese, Irish, Hondurans, Peruvians, Chileans, etc., etc.), they
make him leave the camp; and when a Chinaman does that thing, they hang
him.</p>
<p>It was in this way that he found out that in many districts of the
vast Pacific coast, so strong is the wild, free love of justice in the
hearts of the people, that whenever any secret and mysterious crime is
committed, they say, “Let justice be done, though the heavens fall,“ and
go straightway and swing a Chinaman.</p>
<p>It was in this way that he found out that by studying one half of
each day’s “local items,“ it would appear that the police of San
Francisco were either asleep or dead, and by studying the other half it
would seem that the reporters were gone mad with admiration of the
energy, the virtue, the high effectiveness, and the dare-devil
intrepidity of that very police-making exultant mention of how “the
Argus-eyed officer So-and-so“ captured a wretched knave of a Chinaman
who was stealing chickens, and brought him gloriously to the city
prison; and how “the gallant officer Such-and-such-a-one“ quietly kept
an eye on the movements of an “unsuspecting, almond-eyed son of
Confucius“ (your reporter is nothing if not facetious), following him
around with that far-off look. of vacancy and unconsciousness always so
finely affected by that inscrutable being, the forty-dollar policeman,
during a waking interval, and captured him at last in the very act of
placing his hands in a suspicious manner upon a paper of tacks, left by
the owner in an exposed situation; and how one officer performed this
prodigious thing, and another officer that, and another the other–and
pretty much every one of these performances having for a dazzling
central incident a Chinaman guilty of a shilling’s worth of crime, an
unfortunate, whose misdemeanor must be hurrahed into something enormous
in order to keep the public from noticing how many really important
rascals went uncaptured in the mean time, and how overrated those
glorified policemen actually are.</p>
<p>It was in this way that the boy found out that the legislature, being
aware that the Constitution has made America, an asylum for the poor and
the oppressed of all nations, and that, therefore, the poor and
oppressed who fly to our shelter must not be charged a disabling
admission fee, made a law that every Chinaman, upon landing, must be
vaccinated upon the wharf, and pay to the state’s appointed officer ten
dollars for the service, when there are plenty of doctors in San
Francisco who would be glad enough to do it for him for fifty cents.</p>
<p>It was in this way that the boy found out that a Chinaman had no
rights that any man was bound to respect; that he had no sorrows that
any man was bound to pity; that neither his life nor his liberty was
worth the purchase of a penny when a white man needed a scapegoat; that
nobody loved Chinamen, nobody befriended them, nobody spared them
suffering when it was convenient to inflict it; everybody, individuals,
communities, the majesty of the state itself, joined in hating, abusing,
and persecuting these humble strangers.</p>
<p>And, therefore, what could have been more natural than for this
sunny-hearted-boy, tripping along to Sunday-school, with his mind
teeming with freshly learned incentives to high and virtuous action, to
say to himself:</p>
<p>“Ah, there goes a Chinaman! God will not love me if I do not stone
him.“</p>
<p>And for this he was arrested and put in the city jail.</p>
<p>Everything conspired to teach him that it was a high and holy thing
to stone a Chinaman, and yet he no sooner attempts to do his duty than
he is punished for it–he, poor chap, who has been aware all his life
that one of the principal recreations of the police, out toward the Gold
Refinery, is to look on with tranquil enjoyment while the butchers of
Brannan Street set their dogs on unoffending Chinamen, and make them
flee for their lives.</p>
<p>–[I have many such memories in my mind, but am thinking just at
present of one particular one, where the Brannan Street butchers set
their dogs on a Chinaman who was quietly passing with a basket of
clothes on his head; and while the dogs mutilated his flesh, a butcher
increased the hilarity of the occasion by knocking some of the
Chinaman’s teeth down his throat with half a brick. This incident sticks
in my memory with a more malevolent tenacity, perhaps, on account of the
fact that I was in the employ of a San Francisco journal at the time,
and was not allowed to publish it because it might offend some of the
peculiar element that subscribed for the paper.]</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the tuition in the humanities which the entire
“Pacific coast“ gives its youth, there is a very sublimity of
incongruity in the virtuous flourish with which the good city fathers of
San Francisco proclaim (as they have lately done) that “The police are
positively ordered to arrest all boys, of every description and wherever
found, who engage in assaulting Chinamen.“</p>
<p>Still, let us be truly glad they have made the order, notwithstanding
its inconsistency; and let us rest perfectly confident the police are
glad, too. Because there is no personal peril in arresting boys,
provided they be of the small kind, and the reporters will have to laud
their performances just as loyally as ever, or go without items.</p>
<p>The new form for local items in San Francisco will now be: “The
ever-vigilant and efficient officer So-and-so succeeded, yesterday
afternoon, in arresting Master Tommy Jones, after a determined
resistance,“ etc., etc., followed by the customary statistics and final
hurrah, with its unconscious sarcasm: “We are happy in being able to
state that this is the forty-seventh boy arrested by this gallant
officer since the new ordinance went into effect. The most extraordinary
activity prevails in the police department. Nothing like it has been
seen since we can remember.“</p>
<p>THE JUDGE’S “SPIRITED WOMAN“</p>
<p>“I was sitting here,“ said the judge, “in this old pulpit, holding
court, and we were trying a big, wicked-looking Spanish desperado for
killing the husband of a bright, pretty Mexican woman. It was a lazy
summer day, and an awfully long one, and the witnesses were tedious.
None of us took any interest in the trial except that nervous, uneasy
devil of a Mexican woman because you know how they love and how they
hate, and this one had loved her husband with all her might, and now she
had boiled it all down into hate, and stood here spitting it at that
Spaniard with her eyes; and I tell you she would stir me up, too, with a
little of her summer lightning, occasionally. Well, I had my coat off
and my heels up, lolling and sweating, and smoking one of those cabbage
cigars the San Francisco people used to think were good enough for us in
those times; and the lawyers they all had their coats off, and were
smoking and whittling, and the witnesses the same, and so was the
prisoner. Well, the fact is, there warn’t any interest in a murder trial
then, because the fellow was always brought in ‘not guilty,’ the jury
expecting him to do as much for them some time; and, although the
evidence was straight and square against this Spaniard, we knew we could
not convict him without seeming to be rather high-handed and sort of
reflecting on every gentleman in the community; for there warn’t any
carriages and liveries then, and so the only ‘style’ there was, was to
keep your private graveyard. But that woman seemed to have her heart set
on hanging that Spaniard; and you’d ought to have seen how she would
glare on him a minute, and then look up at me in her pleading way, and
then turn and for the next five minutes search the jury’s faces, and by
and by drop her face in her hands for just a little while as if she was
most ready to give up; but out she’d come again directly, and be as live
and anxious as ever. But when the jury announced the verdict–Not
Guilty–and I told the prisoner he was acquitted and free to go, that
woman rose up till she appeared to be as tall and grand as a
seventy-four-gun ship, and says she:</p>
<p>“‘Judge, do I understand you to say that this man is not guilty that
murdered my husband without any cause before my own eyes and my little
children’s, and that all has been done to him that ever justice and the
law can do?’</p>
<p>“‘The same,’ says I.</p>
<p>“And then what do you reckon she did? Why, she turned on that
smirking Spanish fool like a wildcat, and out with a ‘navy’ and shot him
dead in open court!“</p>
<p>“That was spirited, I am willing to admit.“</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it, though?“ said the judge admiringly.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have missed it for anything. I adjourned court right on
the spot, and we put on our coats and went out and took up a collection
for her and her cubs, and sent them over the mountains to their friends.
Ah, she was a spirited wench!“</p>
