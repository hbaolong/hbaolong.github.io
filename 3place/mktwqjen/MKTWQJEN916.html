1877. TO BERMUDA WITH TWICHELL. PROPOSITION TO TH. NAST. THE WHITTIER
DINNER</h4>
<p>Mark Twain must have been too busy to write letters that winter.
Those that have survived are few and unimportant. As a matter of fact,
he was writing the play, “Ah Sin,“ with Bret Harte, and getting it ready
for production. Harte was a guest in the Clemens home while the play was
being written, and not always a pleasant one. He was full of
requirements, critical as to the ‘menage,’ to the point of sarcasm. The
long friendship between Clemens and Harte weakened under the strain of
collaboration and intimate daily intercourse, never to renew its old
fiber. It was an unhappy outcome of an enterprise which in itself was to
prove of little profit. The play, “Ah Sin,“ had many good features, and
with Charles T. Parsloe in an amusing Chinese part might have been made
a success, if the two authors could have harmoniously undertaken the
needed repairs. It opened in Washington in May, and a letter from
Parsloe, written at the moment, gives a hint of the situation.</p>
<p>From Charles T. Parsloe to S. L. Clemens:</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D. C. May 11th, 1877. MR. CLEMENS,–I forgot whether I
acknowledged receipt of check by telegram. Harte has been here since
Monday last and done little or nothing yet, but promises to have
something fixed by tomorrow morning. We have been making some
improvements among ourselves. The last act is weak at the end, and I do
hope Mr. Harte will have something for a good finish to the piece. The
other acts I think are all right, now.</p>
<p>Hope you have entirely recovered. I am not very well myself, the
excitement of a first night is bad enough, but to have the annoyance
with Harte that I have is too much for a beginner. I ain’t used to it.
The houses have been picking up since Tuesday Mr. Ford has worked well
and hard for us. Yours in, haste, CHAS. THOS. PARSLOE.</p>
<p>The play drew some good houses in Washington, but it could not hold
them for a run. Never mind what was the matter with it; perhaps a very
small change at the right point would have turned it into a fine
success. We have seen in a former letter the obligation which Mark Twain
confessed to Harte–a debt he had tried in many ways to repay–obtaining
for him a liberal book contract with Bliss; advancing him frequent and
large sums of money which Harte could not, or did not, repay; seeking to
advance his fortunes in many directions. The mistake came when he
introduced another genius into the intracacies of his daily life.
Clemens went down to Washington during the early rehearsals of “Ah
Sin.“</p>
<p>Meantime, Rutherford B. Hayes had been elected President, and Clemens
one day called with a letter of introduction from Howells, thinking to
meet the Chief Executive. His own letter to Howells, later, probably
does not give the real reason of his failure, but it will be amusing to
those who recall the erratic personality of George Francis Train. Train
and Twain were sometimes confused by the very unlettered; or
pretendedly, by Mark Twain’s friends.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>BALTIMORE, May 1, ’77. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Found I was not absolutely
needed in Washington so I only staid 24 hours, and am on my way home,
now. I called at the White House, and got admission to Col. Rodgers,
because I wanted to inquire what was the right hour to go and infest
the, President. It was my luck to strike the place in the dead waste and
middle of the day, the very busiest time. I perceived that Mr. Rodgers
took me for George Francis Train and had made up his mind not to let me
get at the President; so at the end of half an hour I took my letter of
introduction from the table and went away. It was a great pity all
round, and a great loss to the nation, for I was brim full of the
Eastern question. I didn’t get to see the President or the Chief
Magistrate either, though I had sort of a glimpse of a lady at a window
who resembled her portraits. Yrs ever, MARK.</p>
<p>Howells condoled with him on his failure to see the President, “but,“
he added, “if you and I had both been there, our combined skill would
have no doubt procured us to be expelled from the White House by Fred
Douglass. But the thing seems to be a complete failure as it was.“
Douglass at this time being the Marshal of Columbia, gives special point
to Howells’s suggestion.</p>
<p>Later, in May, Clemens took Twichell for an excursion to Bermuda. He
had begged Howells to go with them, but Howells, as usual, was full of
literary affairs. Twichell and Clemens spent four glorious days tramping
the length and breadth of the beautiful island, and remembered it always
as one of their happiest adventures. “Put it down as an Oasis!“ wrote
Twichell on his return, “I’m afraid I shall not see as green a spot
again soon. And it was your invention and your gift. And your company
was the best of it. Indeed, I never took more comfort in being with you
than on this journey, which, my boy, is saying a great deal.“</p>
<p>To Howells, Clemens triumphantly reported the success of the
excursion.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>FARMINGTON AVENUE, HARTFORD, May 29, 1877. Confound you, Joe Twichell
and I roamed about Bermuda day and night and never ceased to gabble and
enjoy. About half the talk was–“It is a burning shame that Howells isn’t
here.“ “Nobody could get at the very meat and marrow of this pervading
charm and deliciousness like Howells;“ “How Howells would revel in the
quaintness, and the simplicity of this people and the Sabbath repose of
this land.“ “What an imperishable sketch Howells would make of
Capt. West the whaler, and Capt. Hope with the patient, pathetic face,
wanderer in all the oceans for 42 years, lucky in none; coming home
defeated once more, now, minus his ship –resigned, uncomplaining, being
used to this.“ “What a rattling chapter Howells would make out of the
small boy Alfred, with his alert eye and military brevity and exactness
of speech; and out of the old landlady; and her sacred onions; and her
daughter; and the visiting clergyman; and the ancient pianos of Hamilton
and the venerable music in vogue there –and forty other things which we
shall leave untouched or touched but lightly upon, we not being worthy.“
“Dam Howells for not being here!“ (this usually from me, not
Twichell.)</p>
<p>O, your insufferable pride, which will have a fall some day! If you
had gone with us and let me pay the 0 which the trip and the board and
the various nicknacks and mementoes would cost, I would have picked up
enough droppings from your conversation to pay me 500 per cent profit in
the way of the several magazine articles which I could have written,
whereas I can now write only one or two and am therefore largely out of
pocket by your proud ways. Ponder these things. Lord, what a perfectly
bewitching excursion it was! I traveled under an assumed name and was
never molested with a polite attention from anybody. Love to you all.
Yrs ever MARK</p>
<p>Aldrich, meantime, had invited the Clemenses to Ponkapog during the
Bermuda absence, and Clemens hastened to send him a line expressing
regrets. At the close he said:</p>
<p>To T. B. Aldrich, in Ponkapog, Mass.:</p>
<p>FARMINGTON AVENUE, HARTFORD, June 3, 1877. Day after tomorrow we
leave for the hills beyond Elmira, N. Y. for the summer, when I shall
hope to write a book of some sort or other to beat the people with. A
work similar to your new one in the Atlantic is what I mean, though I
have not heard what the nature of that one is. Immoral, I suppose. Well,
you are right. Such books sell best, Howells says. Howells says he is
going to make his next book indelicate. He says he thinks there is money
in it. He says there is a large class of the young, in schools and
seminaries who–But you let him tell you. He has ciphered it all down to
a demonstration.</p>
<p>With the warmest remembrances to the pair of you Ever Yours SAMUEL L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Clemens would naturally write something about Bermuda, and began at
once, “Random Notes of an Idle Excursion,“ and presently completed four
papers, which Howells eagerly accepted for the Atlantic. Then we find
him plunging into another play, this time alone.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, June 27, 1877. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–If you should not like the
first 2 chapters, send them to me and begin with Chapter 3–or Part 3, I
believe you call these things in the magazine. I have finished No. 4.,
which closes the series, and will mail it tomorrow if I think of it. I
like this one, I liked the preceding one (already mailed to you some
time ago) but I had my doubts about 1 and 2. Do not hesitate to squelch
them, even with derision and insult.</p>
<p>Today I am deep in a comedy which I began this morning–principal
character, that old detective–I skeletoned the first act and wrote the
second, today; and am dog-tired, now. Fifty-four close pages of MS in 7
hours. Once I wrote 55 pages at a sitting–that was on the opening
chapters of the “Gilded Age“ novel. When I cool down, an hour from now,
I shall go to zero, I judge. Yrs ever, MARK.</p>
<p>Clemens had doubts as to the quality of the Bermuda papers, and with
some reason. They did not represent him at his best. Nevertheless, they
were pleasantly entertaining, and Howells expressed full approval of
them for Atlantic use. The author remained troubled.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, July 4,1877. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–It is splendid of you to say
those pleasant things. But I am still plagued with doubts about Parts 1
and 2. If you have any, don’t print. If otherwise, please make some cold
villain like Lathrop read and pass sentence on them. Mind, I thought
they were good, at first–it was the second reading that accomplished its
hellish purpose on me. Put them up for a new verdict. Part 4 has lain in
my pigeon-hole a good while, and when I put it there I had a Christian’s
confidence in 4 aces in it; and you can be sure it will skip toward
Connecticut tomorrow before any fatal fresh reading makes me draw my
bet.</p>
<p>I’ve piled up 151 MS pages on my comedy. The first, second and fourth
acts are done, and done to my satisfaction, too. Tomorrow and next day
will finish the 3rd act and the play. I have not written less than 30
pages any day since I began. Never had so much fun over anything in my
life-never such consuming interest and delight. (But Lord bless you the
second reading will fetch it!) And just think!–I had Sol Smith Russell
in my mind’s eye for the old detective’s part, and hang it he has gone
off pottering with Oliver Optic, or else the papers lie.</p>
<p>I read everything about the President’s doings there with
exultation.</p>
<p>I wish that old ass of a private secretary hadn’t taken me for George
Francis Train. If ignorance were a means of grace I wouldn’t trade that
gorilla’s chances for the Archbishop of Canterbury’s.</p>
<p>I shall call on the President again, by and by. I shall go in my war
paint; and if I am obstructed the nation will have the unusual spectacle
of a private secretary with a pen over one ear a tomahawk over the
other.</p>
<p>I read the entire Atlantic this time. Wonderful number. Mrs. Rose
Terry Cooke’s story was a ten-strike. I wish she would write 12 old-time
New England tales a year.</p>
<p>Good times to you all! Mind if you don’t run here for a few days you
will go to hence without having had a fore-glimpse of heaven.</p>
<p>MARK.</p>
<p>The play, “Ah Sin,“ that had done little enough in Washington, was
that summer given another trial by Augustin Daly, at the Fifth Avenue
Theater, New York, with a fine company. Clemens had undertaken to doctor
the play, and it would seem to have had an enthusiastic reception on the
opening night. But it was a summer audience, unspoiled by many
attractions. “Ah Sin“ was never a success in the New York season–never a
money-maker on the road.</p>
<p>The reference in the first paragraph of the letter that follows is to
the Bermuda chapters which Mark Twain was publishing simultaneously in
England and America.</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Aug 3,1877. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I have mailed one set of the
slips to London, and told Bentley you would print Sept. 15, in October
Atlantic, and he must not print earlier in Temple Bar. Have I got the
dates and things right?</p>
<p>I am powerful glad to see that No. 1 reads a nation sight better in
print than it did in MS. I told Bentley we’d send him the slips, each
time, 6 weeks before day of publication. We can do that can’t we? Two
months ahead would be still better I suppose, but I don’t know.</p>
<p>“Ah Sin“ went a-booming at the Fifth Avenue. The reception of Col.
Sellers was calm compared to it.</p>
<p>*The criticisms were just; the criticisms of the great New York
dailies are always just, intelligent, and square and
honest–notwithstanding, by a blunder which nobody was seriously to blame
for, I was made to say exactly the opposite of this in a newspaper some
time ago. Never said it at all, and moreover I never thought it. I could
not publicly correct it before the play appeared in New York, because
that would look as if I had really said that thing and then was moved by
fears for my pocket and my reputation to take it back. But I can correct
it now, and shall do it; for now my motives cannot be impugned. When I
began this letter, it had not occurred to me to use you in this
connection, but it occurs to me now. Your opinion and mine, uttered a
year ago, and repeated more than once since, that the candor and ability
of the New York critics were beyond question, is a matter which makes it
proper enough that I should speak through you at this time. Therefore if
you will print this paragraph somewhere, it may remove the impression
that I say unjust things which I do not think, merely for the pleasure
of talking.</p>
<p>There, now, Can’t you say–</p>
<p>“In a letter to Mr. Howells of the Atlantic Monthly, Mark Twain
describes the reception of the new comedy ‘Ali Sin,’ and then goes on to
say:“ etc.</p>
<p>Beginning at the star with the words, “The criticisms were just.“
Mrs. Clemens says, “Don’t ask that of Mr. Howells–it will be
disagreeable to him.“ I hadn’t thought of it, but I will bet two to one
on the correctness of her instinct. We shall see.</p>
<p>Will you cut that paragraph out of this letter and precede it with
the remarks suggested (or with better ones,) and send it to the Globe or
some other paper? You can’t do me a bigger favor; and yet if it is in
the least disagreeable, you mustn’t think of it. But let me know, right
away, for I want to correct this thing before it grows stale again. I
explained myself to only one critic (the World)–the consequence was a
noble notice of the play. This one called on me, else I shouldn’t have
explained myself to him.</p>
<p>I have been putting in a deal of hard work on that play in New York,
but it is full of incurable defects.</p>
<p>My old Plunkett family seemed wonderfully coarse and vulgar on the
stage, but it was because they were played in such an outrageously and
inexcusably coarse way. The Chinaman is killingly funny. I don’t know
when I have enjoyed anything as much as I did him. The people say there
isn’t enough of him in the piece. That’s a triumph–there’ll never be any
more of him in it.</p>
<p>John Brougham said, “Read the list of things which the critics have
condemned in the piece, and you have unassailable proofs that the play
contains all the requirements of success and a long life.“</p>
<p>That is true. Nearly every time the audience roared I knew it was
over something that would be condemned in the morning (justly, too) but
must be left in–for low comedies are written for the drawing-room, the
kitchen and the stable, and if you cut out the kitchen and the stable
the drawing-room can’t support the play by itself.</p>
<p>There was as much money in the house the first two nights as in the
first ten of Sellers. Haven’t heard from the third–I came away. Yrs
ever, MARK.</p>
<p>In a former letter we have seen how Mark Twain, working on a story
that was to stand as an example of his best work, and become one of his
surest claims to immortality (The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn),
displayed little enthusiasm in his undertaking. In the following letter,
which relates the conclusion of his detective comedy, we find him at the
other extreme, on very tiptoe with enthusiasm over something wholly
without literary value or dramatic possibility. One of the hall-marks of
genius is the inability to discriminate as to the value of its output.
“Simon Wheeler, Amateur Detective“ was a dreary, absurd, impossible
performance, as wild and unconvincing in incident and dialogue as
anything out of an asylum could well be. The title which he first chose
for it, “Balaam’s Ass,“ was properly in keeping with the general scheme.
Yet Mark Twain, still warm with the creative fever, had the fullest
faith in it as a work of art and a winner of fortune. It would never see
the light of production, of course. We shall see presently that the
distinguished playwright, Dion Boucicault, good-naturedly complimented
it as being better than “Ahi Sin.“ One must wonder what that skilled
artist really thought, and how he could do even this violence to his
conscience.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Wednesday P.M. (1877) MY DEAR HOWELLS,–It’s finished. I was
misled by hurried mis-paging. There were ten pages of notes, and over
300 pages of MS when the play was done. Did it in 42 hours, by the
clock; 40 pages of the Atlantic–but then of course it’s very “fat.“
Those are the figures, but I don’t believe them myself, because the
thing’s impossible.</p>
<p>But let that pass. All day long, and every day, since I finished (in
the rough) I have been diligently altering, amending, re-writing,
cutting down. I finished finally today. Can’t think of anything else in
the way of an improvement. I thought I would stick to it while the
interest was hot–and I am mighty glad I did. A week from now it will be
frozen–then revising would be drudgery. (You see I learned something
from the fatal blunder of putting “Ah Sin“ aside before it was
finished.)</p>
<p>She’s all right, now. She reads in two hours and 20 minutes and will
play not longer than 2 3/4 hours. Nineteen characters; 3 acts; (I
bunched 2 into 1.)</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will draw up an exhaustive synopsis to insert in the
printed title-page for copyrighting, and then on Friday or Saturday I go
to New York to remain a week or ten days and lay for an actor. Wish you
could run down there and have a holiday. ’Twould be fun.</p>
<p>My wife won’t have “Balaam’s Ass“; therefore I call the piece “Cap’n
Simon Wheeler, The Amateur Detective.“ Yrs MARK.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Aug. 29, 1877. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Just got your letter last
night. No, dern that article,–[One of the Bermuda chapters.]–it made me
cry when I read it in proof, it was so oppressively and ostentatiously
poor. Skim your eye over it again and you will think as I do. If Isaac
and the prophets of Baal can be doctored gently and made permissible, it
will redeem the thing: but if it can’t, let’s burn all of the articles
except the tail-end of it and use that as an introduction to the next
article–as I suggested in my letter to you of day before yesterday. (I
had this proof from Cambridge before yours came.)</p>
<p>Boucicault says my new play is ever so much better than “Ah Sin;“
says the Amateur detective is a bully character, too. An actor is
chawing over the play in New York, to see if the old Detective is suited
to his abilities. Haven’t heard from him yet.</p>
<p>If you’ve got that paragraph by you yet, and if in your judgment it
would be good to publish it, and if you absolutely would not mind doing
it, then I think I’d like to have you do it–or else put some other words
in my mouth that will be properer, and publish them. But mind, don’t
think of it for a moment if it is distasteful–and doubtless it is. I
value your judgment more than my own, as to the wisdom of saying
anything at all in this matter. To say nothing leaves me in an injurious
position –and yet maybe I might do better to speak to the men themselves
when I go to New York. This was my latest idea, and it looked wise.</p>
<p>We expect to leave here for home Sept. 4, reaching there the 8th–but
we may be delayed a week.</p>
<p>Curious thing. I read passages from my play, and a full synopsis, to
Boucicault, who was re-writing a play, which he wrote and laid aside 3
or 4 years ago. (My detective is about that age, you know.) Then he read
a passage from his play, where a real detective does some things that
are as idiotic as some of my old Wheeler’s performances. Showed me the
passages, and behold, his man’s name is Wheeler! However, his Wheeler is
not a prominent character, so we’ll not alter the names. My Wheeler’s
name is taken from the old jumping Frog sketch.</p>
<p>I am re-reading Ticknor’s diary, and am charmed with it, though I
still say he refers to too many good things when he could just as well
have told them. Think of the man traveling 8 days in convoy and familiar
intercourse with a band of outlaws through the mountain fastnesses of
Spain–he the fourth stranger they had encountered in thirty years–and
compressing this priceless experience into a single colorless paragraph
of his diary! They spun yarns to this unworthy devil, too.</p>
<p>I wrote you a very long letter a day or two ago, but Susy Crane
wanted to make a copy of it to keep, so it has not gone yet. It may go
today, possibly.</p>
<p>We unite in warm regards to you and yours. Yrs ever, MARK.</p>
<p>The Ticknor referred to in a former letter was Professor George
Ticknor, of Harvard College, a history-writer of distinction. On the
margin of the “Diary“ Mark Twain once wrote, “Ticknor is a Millet, who
makes all men fall in love with him.“ And adds: “Millet was the cause of
lovable qualities in people, and then he admired and loved those persons
for the very qualities which he (without knowing it) had created in
them. Perhaps it would be strictly truer of these two men to say that
they bore within them the divine something in whose presence the evil in
people fled away and hid itself, while all that was good in them came
spontaneously forward out of the forgotten walls and comers in their
systems where it was accustomed to hide.“</p>
<p>It is Frank Millet, the artist, he is speaking of–a knightly soul
whom all the Clemens household loved, and who would one day meet his
knightly end with those other brave men that found death together when
the Titanic went down.</p>
<p>The Clemens family was still at Quarry Farm at the end of August, and
one afternoon there occurred a startling incident which Mark Twain
thought worth setting down in practically duplicate letters to Howells
and to Dr. John Brown. It may be of interest to the reader to know that
John T. Lewis, the colored man mentioned, lived to a good old age–a
pensioner of the Clemens family and, in the course of time, of H. H.
Rogers. Howells’s letter follows. It is the “very long letter“ referred
to in the foregoing.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells and wife, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Aug. 25 ’77. MY DEAR HOWELLSES,–I thought I ought to make a
sort of record of it for further reference; the pleasantest way to do
that would be to write it to somebody; but that somebody would let it
leak into print and that we wish to avoid. The Howellses would be
safe–so let us tell the Howellses about it.</p>
<p>Day before yesterday was a fine summer day away up here on the
summit. Aunt Marsh and Cousin May Marsh were here visiting Susie Crane
and Livy at our farmhouse. By and by mother Langdon came up the hill in
the “high carriage“ with Nora the nurse and little Jervis (Charley
Langdon’s little boy)–Timothy the coachman driving. Behind these came
Charley’s wife and little girl in the buggy, with the new, young, spry,
gray horse–a high-stepper. Theodore Crane arrived a little later.</p>
<p>The Bay and Susy were on hand with their nurse, Rosa. I was on hand,
too. Susy Crane’s trio of colored servants ditto–these being Josie,
house-maid; Aunty Cord, cook, aged 62, turbaned, very tall, very broad,
very fine every way (see her portrait in “A True Story just as I Heard
It“ in my Sketches;) Chocklate (the laundress) (as the Bay calls her–she
can’t say Charlotte,) still taller, still more majestic of proportions,
turbaned, very black, straight as an Indian–age 24. Then there was the
farmer’s wife (colored) and her little girl, Susy.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it a good audience to get up an excitement before? Good
excitable, inflammable material?</p>
<p>Lewis was still down town, three miles away, with his two-horse
wagon, to get a load of manure. Lewis is the farmer (colored). He is of
mighty frame and muscle, stocky, stooping, ungainly, has a good manly
face and a clear eye. Age about 45–and the most picturesque of men, when
he sits in his fluttering work-day rags, humped forward into a bunch,
with his aged slouch hat mashed down over his ears and neck. It is a
spectacle to make the broken-hearted smile. Lewis has worked mighty hard
and remained mighty poor. At the end of each whole year’s toil he can’t
show a gain of fifty dollars. He had borrowed money of the Cranes till
he owed them 00 and he being conscientious and honest, imagine what it
was to him to have to carry this stubborn, helpless load year in and
year out.</p>
<p>Well, sunset came, and Ida the young and comely (Charley Langdon’s
wife) and her little Julia and the nurse Nora, drove out at the gate
behind the new gray horse and started down the long hill–the high
carriage receiving its load under the porte cochere. Ida was seen to
turn her face toward us across the fence and intervening lawn–Theodore
waved good-bye to her, for he did not know that her sign was a
speechless appeal for help.</p>
<p>The next moment Livy said, “Ida’s driving too fast down hill!“ She
followed it with a sort of scream, “Her horse is running away!“</p>
<p>We could see two hundred yards down that descent. The buggy seemed to
fly. It would strike obstructions and apparently spring the height of a
man from the ground.</p>
<p>Theodore and I left the shrieking crowd behind and ran down the hill
bare-headed and shouting. A neighbor appeared at his gate–a tenth of a
second too late! the buggy vanished past him like a thought. My last
glimpse showed it for one instant, far down the descent, springing high
in the air out of a cloud of dust, and then it disappeared. As I flew
down the road my impulse was to shut my eyes as I turned them to the
right or left, and so delay for a moment the ghastly spectacle of
mutilation and death I was expecting.</p>
<p>I ran on and on, still spared this spectacle, but saying to myself:
“I shall see it at the turn of the road; they never can pass that turn
alive.“ When I came in sight of that turn I saw two wagons there bunched
together–one of them full of people. I said, “Just so–they are staring
petrified at the remains.“</p>
<p>But when I got amongst that bunch, there sat Ida in her buggy and
nobody hurt, not even the horse or the vehicle. Ida was pale but serene.
As I came tearing down, she smiled back over her shoulder at me and
said, “Well, we’re alive yet, aren’t we?“ A miracle had been performed
–nothing else.</p>
<p>You see Lewis, the prodigious, humped upon his front seat, had been
toiling up, on his load of manure; he saw the frantic horse plunging
down the hill toward him, on a full gallop, throwing his heels as high
as a man’s head at every jump. So Lewis turned his team diagonally
across the road just at the “turn,“ thus making a V with the fence–the
running horse could not escape that, but must enter it. Then Lewis
sprang to the ground and stood in this V. He gathered his vast strength,
and with a perfect Creedmoor aim he seized the gray horse’s bit as he
plunged by and fetched him up standing!</p>
<p>It was down hill, mind you. Ten feet further down hill neither Lewis
nor any other man could have saved them, for they would have been on the
abrupt “turn,“ then. But how this miracle was ever accomplished at all,
by human strength, generalship and accuracy, is clean beyond my
comprehension–and grows more so the more I go and examine the ground and
try to believe it was actually done. I know one thing, well; if Lewis
had missed his aim he would have been killed on the spot in the trap he
had made for himself, and we should have found the rest of the remains
away down at the bottom of the steep ravine.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Theodore and I arrived opposite the house, with the
servants straggling after us, and shouted to the distracted group on the
porch, “Everybody safe!“</p>
<p>Believe it? Why how could they? They knew the road perfectly. We
might as well have said it to people who had seen their friends go over
Niagara.</p>
<p>However, we convinced them; and then, instead of saying something, or
going on crying, they grew very still–words could not express it, I
suppose.</p>
<p>Nobody could do anything that night, or sleep, either; but there was
a deal of moving talk, with long pauses between pictures of that flying
carriage, these pauses represented–this picture intruded itself all the
time and disjointed the talk.</p>
<p>But yesterday evening late, when Lewis arrived from down town he
found his supper spread, and some presents of books there, with very
complimentary writings on the fly-leaves, and certain very complimentary
letters, and more or less greenbacks of dignified denomination pinned to
these letters and fly-leaves,–and one said, among other things, (signed
by the Cranes) “We cancel 00 of your indebtedness to us,“ andandandandc.
andandandandc.</p>
<p>(The end thereof is not yet, of course, for Charley Langdon is West
and will arrive ignorant of all these things, today.)</p>
<p>The supper-room had been kept locked and imposingly secret and
mysterious until Lewis should arrive; but around that part of the house
were gathered Lewis’s wife and child, Chocklate, Josie, Aunty Cord and
our Rosa, canvassing things and waiting impatiently. They were all on
hand when the curtain rose.</p>
<p>Now, Aunty Cord is a violent Methodist and Lewis an implacable Dunker
–Baptist. Those two are inveterate religious disputants. The revealments
having been made Aunty Cord said with effusion–</p>
<p>“Now, let folks go on saying there ain’t no God! Lewis, the Lord sent
you there to stop that horse.“</p>
<p>Says Lewis:</p>
<p>“Then who sent the horse there in sich a shape?“</p>
<p>But I want to call your attention to one thing. When Lewis arrived
the other evening, after saving those lives by a feat which I think is
the most marvelous of any I can call to mind–when he arrived, hunched up
on his manure wagon and as grotesquely picturesque as usual, everybody
wanted to go and see how he looked. They came back and said he was
beautiful. It was so, too–and yet he would have photographed exactly as
he would have done any day these past 7 years that he has occupied this
farm.</p>
<p>Aug. 27. P. S. Our little romance in real life is happily and
satisfactorily completed. Charley has come, listened, acted–and now John
T. Lewis has ceased to consider himself as belonging to that class
called “the poor.“</p>
<p>It has been known, during some years, that it was Lewis’s purpose to
buy a thirty dollar silver watch some day, if he ever got where he could
afford it. Today Ida has given him a new, sumptuous gold Swiss
stem-winding stop-watch; and if any scoffer shall say, “Behold this
thing is out of character,“ there is an inscription within, which will
silence him; for it will teach him that this wearer aggrandizes the
watch, not the watch the wearer.</p>
<p>I was asked beforehand, if this would be a wise gift, and I said
“Yes, the very wisest of all;“ I know the colored race, and I know that
in Lewis’s eyes this fine toy will throw the other more valuable
testimonials far away into the shade. If he lived in England the Humane
Society would give him a gold medal as costly as this watch, and nobody
would say: “It is out of character.“ If Lewis chose to wear a town
clock, who would become it better?</p>
<p>Lewis has sound common sense, and is not going to be spoiled. The
instant he found himself possessed of money, he forgot himself in a plan
to make his old father comfortable, who is wretchedly poor and lives
down in Maryland. His next act, on the spot, was the proffer to the
Cranes of the 00 of his remaining indebtedness to them. This was put off
by them to the indefinite future, for he is not going to be allowed to
pay that at all, though he doesn’t know it.</p>
<p>A letter of acknowledgment from Lewis contains a sentence which
raises it to the dignity of literature:</p>
<p>“But I beg to say, humbly, that inasmuch as divine providence saw fit
to use me as a instrument for the saving of those presshious lives, the
honner conferd upon me was greater than the feat performed.“</p>
<p>That is well said. Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>Howells was moved to use the story in the. “Contributors’ Club,“ and
warned Clemens against letting it get into the newspapers. He declared
he thought it one of the most impressive things he had ever read. But
Clemens seems never to have allowed it to be used in any form. In its
entirety, therefore, it is quite new matter.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Sept. 19, 1877. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I don’t really see how the
story of the runaway horse could read well with the little details of
names and places and things left out. They are the true life of all
narrative. It wouldn’t quite do to print them at this time. We’ll talk
about it when you come. Delicacy–a sad, sad false delicacy–robs
literature of the best two things among its belongings. Family-circle
narrative and obscene stories. But no matter; in that better world which
I trust we are all going to I have the hope and belief that they will
not be denied us.</p>
<p>Say–Twichell and I had an adventure at sea, 4 months ago, which I did
not put in my Bermuda articles, because there was not enough to it. But
the press dispatches bring the sequel today, and now there’s plenty to
it. A sailless, wasteless, chartless, compassless, grubless old
condemned tub that has been drifting helpless about the ocean for 4
months and a half, begging bread and water like any other tramp, flying
a signal of distress permanently, and with 13 innocent, marveling
chuckleheaded Bermuda niggers on board, taking a Pleasure Excursion! Our
ship fed the poor devils on the 25th of last May, far out at sea and
left them to bullyrag their way to New York–and now they ain’t as near
New York as they were then by 250 miles! They have drifted 750 miles and
are still drifting in the relentless Gulf Stream! What a delicious
magazine chapter it would make–but I had to deny myself. I had to come
right out in the papers at once, with my details, so as to try to raise
the government’s sympathy sufficiently to have better succor sent them
than the cutter Colfax, which went a little way in search of them the
other day and then struck a fog and gave it up.</p>
<p>If the President were in Washington I would telegraph him.</p>
<p>When I hear that the “Jonas Smith“ has been found again, I mean to
send for one of those darkies, to come to Hartford and give me his
adventures for an Atlantic article.</p>
<p>Likely you will see my today’s article in the newspapers. Yrs ever,
MARK.</p>
<p>The revenue cutter Colfax went after the Jonas Smith, thinking there
was mutiny or other crime on board. It occurs to me now that, since
there is only mere suffering and misery and nobody to punish, it ceases
to be a matter which (a republican form of) government will feel
authorized to interfere in further. Dam a republican form of
government.</p>
<p>Clemens thought he had given up lecturing for good; he was prosperous
and he had no love for the platform. But one day an idea popped into his
head: Thomas Nast, the “father of the American cartoon,“ had delivered a
successful series of illustrated lectures –talks for which he made the
drawings as he went along. Mark Twain’s idea was to make a combination
with Nast. His letter gives us the plan in full.</p>
<p>To Thomas Nast, Morristown, N. J.:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, CONN. 1877. MY DEAR NAST,–I did not think I should ever
stand on a platform again until the time was come for me to say “I die
innocent.“ But the same old offers keep arriving. I have declined them
all, just as usual, though sorely tempted, as usual.</p>
<p>Now, I do not decline because I mind talking to an audience, but
because (1) traveling alone is so heartbreakingly dreary, and (2)
shouldering the whole show is such a cheer-killing responsibility.</p>
<p>Therefore, I now propose to you what you proposed to me in 1867, ten
years ago (when I was unknown) viz., that you stand on the platform and
make pictures, and I stand by you and blackguard the audience. I should
enormously enjoy meandering around (to big towns–don’t want to go to the
little ones) with you for company.</p>
<p>My idea is not to fatten the lecture agents and lyceums on the
spoils, but put all the ducats religiously into two equal piles, and say
to the artist and lecturer, “Absorb these.“</p>
<p>For instance–[Here follows a plan and a possible list of cities to be
visited. The letter continues]</p>
<p>Call the gross receipts 00,000 for four months and a half, and the
profit from 0,000 to 5,000 (I try to make the figures large enough, and
leave it to the public to reduce them.)</p>
<p>I did not put in Philadelphia because Pugh owns that town, and last
winter when I made a little reading-trip he only paid me 00 and
pretended his concert (I read fifteen minutes in the midst of a concert)
cost him a vast sum, and so he couldn’t afford any more. I could get up
a better concert with a barrel of cats.</p>
<p>I have imagined two or three pictures and concocted the accompanying
remarks to see how the thing would go. I was charmed.</p>
<p>Well, you think it over, Nast, and drop me a line. We should have
some fun. Yours truly, SAMUEL L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The plan came to nothing. Nast, like Clemens, had no special taste
for platforming, and while undoubtedly there would have been large
profits in the combination, the promise of the venture did not compel
his acceptance.</p>
<p>In spite of his distaste for the platform Mark Twain was always
giving readings and lectures, without charge, for some worthy Hartford
cause. He was ready to do what he could to help an entertainment along,
if he could do it in his own way–an original way, sometimes, and not
always gratifying to the committee, whose plans were likely to be
prearranged.</p>
<p>For one thing, Clemens, supersensitive in the matter of putting
himself forward in his own town, often objected to any special
exploitation of his name. This always distressed the committee, who saw
a large profit to their venture in the prestige of his fame. The
following characteristic letter was written in self-defense when, on one
such occasion, a committee had become sufficiently peevish to abandon a
worthy enterprise.</p>
<p>To an Entertainment Committee, in Hartford:</p>
<p>Nov. 9. E. S. SYKES, Esq:</p>
<p>Dr. SIR,–Mr. Burton’s note puts upon me all the blame of the
destruction of an enterprise which had for its object the succor of the
Hartford poor. That is to say, this enterprise has been dropped because
of the “dissatisfaction with Mr. Clemens’s stipulations.“ Therefore I
must be allowed to say a word in my defense.</p>
<p>There were two “stipulations“–exactly two. I made one of them; if the
other was made at all, it was a joint one, from the choir and me.</p>
<p>My individual stipulation was, that my name should be kept out of the
newspapers. The joint one was that sufficient tickets to insure a good
sum should be sold before the date of the performance should be set.
(Understand, we wanted a good sum–I do not think any of us bothered
about a good house; it was money we were after)</p>
<p>Now you perceive that my concern is simply with my individual
stipulation. Did that break up the enterprise?</p>
<p>Eugene Burton said he would sell 00 worth of the tickets
himself.–Mr. Smith said he would sell 00 or 00 worth himself. My plan
for Asylum Hill Church would have ensured 50 from that quarter.–All this
in the face of my “Stipulation.“ It was proposed to raise 000; did my
stipulation render the raising of 00 or 00 in a dozen churches
impossible?</p>
<p>My stipulation is easily defensible. When a mere reader or lecturer
has appeared 3 or 4 times in a town of Hartford’s size, he is a good
deal more than likely to get a very unpleasant snub if he shoves himself
forward about once or twice more. Therefore I long ago made up my mind
that whenever I again appeared here, it should be only in a minor
capacity and not as a chief attraction.</p>
<p>Now, I placed that harmless and very justifiable stipulation before
the committee the other day; they carried it to headquarters and it was
accepted there. I am not informed that any objection was made to it, or
that it was regarded as an offense. It seems late in the day, now, after
a good deal of trouble has been taken and a good deal of thankless work
done by the committees, to, suddenly tear up the contract and then turn
and bowl me down from long range as being the destroyer of it.</p>
<p>If the enterprise has failed because of my individual stipulation,
here you have my proper and reasonable reasons for making that
stipulation.</p>
<p>If it has failed because of the joint stipulation, put the blame
there, and let us share it collectively.</p>
<p>I think our plan was a good one. I do not doubt that Mr. Burton still
approves of it, too. I believe the objections come from other quarters,
and not from him. Mr. Twichell used the following words in last Sunday’s
sermon, (if I remember correctly):</p>
<p>“My hearers, the prophet Deuteronomy says this wise thing: ‘Though ye
plan a goodly house for the poor, and plan it with wisdom, and do take
off your coats and set to to build it, with high courage, yet shall the
croaker presently come, and lift up his voice, (having his coat on,) and
say, Verily this plan is not well planned–and he will go his way; and
the obstructionist will come, and lift up his voice, (having his coat
on,) and say, Behold, this is but a sick plan–and he will go his way;
and the man that knows it all will come, and lift up his voice, (having
his coat on,) and say, Lo, call they this a plan? then will he go his
way; and the places which knew him once shall know him no more forever,
because he was not, for God took him. Now therefore I say unto you,
Verily that house will not be budded. And I say this also: He that
waiteth for all men to be satisfied with his plan, let him seek eternal
life, for he shall need it.’“</p>
<p>This portion of Mr. Twichell’s sermon made a great impression upon
me, and I was grieved that some one had not wakened me earlier so that I
might have heard what went before.</p>
<p>S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Mr. Sykes (of the firm of Sykes andandandand Newton, the Allen House
Pharmacy) replied that he had read the letter to the committee and that
it had set those gentlemen right who had not before understood the
situation. “If others were as ready to do their part as yourself our
poor would not want assistance,“ he said, in closing.</p>
<p>We come now to an incident which assumes the proportions of an
episode-even of a catastrophe–in Mark Twain’s career. The disaster was
due to a condition noted a few pages earlier–the inability of genius to
judge its own efforts. The story has now become history –printed
history–it having been sympathetically told by Howells in My Mark Twain,
and more exhaustively, with a report of the speech that invited the
lightning, in a former work by the present writer.</p>
<p>The speech was made at John Greenleaf Whittier’s seventieth birthday
dinner, given by the Atlantic staff on the evening of December 17, 1877.
It was intended as a huge joke–a joke that would shake the sides of
these venerable Boston deities, Longfellow, Emerson, Holmes, and the
rest of that venerated group. Clemens had been a favorite at the
Atlantic lunches and dinners–a speech by him always an event. This time
he decided to outdo himself.</p>
<p>He did that, but not in the way he had intended. To use one of his
own metaphors, he stepped out to meet the rainbow and got struck by
lightning. His joke was not of the Boston kind or size. When its full
nature burst upon the company–when the ears of the assembled diners
heard the sacred names of Longfellow, Emerson, and Holmes lightly
associated with human aspects removed–oh, very far removed –from
Cambridge and Concord, a chill fell upon the diners that presently
became amazement, and then creeping paralysis. Nobody knew afterward
whether the great speech that he had so gaily planned ever came to a
natural end or not. Somebody–the next on the program–attempted to follow
him, but presently the company melted out of the doors and crept away
into the night.</p>
<p>It seemed to Mark Twain that his career had come to an end. Back in
Hartford, sweating and suffering through sleepless nights, he wrote
Howells his anguish.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>Sunday Night. 1877. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–My sense of disgrace does not
abate. It grows. I see that it is going to add itself to my list of
permanencies–a list of humiliations that extends back to when I was
seven years old, and which keep on persecuting me regardless of my
repentancies.</p>
<p>I feel that my misfortune has injured me all over the country;
therefore it will be best that I retire from before the public at
present. It will hurt the Atlantic for me to appear in its pages, now.
So it is my opinion and my wife’s that the telephone story had better be
suppressed. Will you return those proofs or revises to me, so that I can
use the same on some future occasion?</p>
<p>It seems as if I must have been insane when I wrote that speech and
saw no harm in it, no disrespect toward those men whom I reverenced so
much. And what shame I brought upon you, after what you said in
introducing me! It burns me like fire to think of it.</p>
<p>The whole matter is a dreadful subject–let me drop it here–at least
on paper. Penitently yrs, MARK.</p>
<p>Howells sent back a comforting letter. “I have no idea of dropping
you out of the Atlantic,“ he wrote; “and Mr. Houghton has still less, if
possible. You are going to help and not hurt us many a year yet, if you
will…. You are not going to be floored by it; there is more justice than
that, even in this world.“</p>
<p>Howells added that Charles Elliot Norton had expressed just the right
feeling concerning the whole affair, and that many who had not heard the
speech, but read the newspaper reports of it, had found it without
offense.</p>
<p>Clemens wrote contrite letters to Holmes, Emerson, and Longfellow,
and received most gracious acknowledgments. Emerson, indeed, had not
heard the speech: His faculties were already blurred by the mental mists
that would eventually shut him in. Clemens wrote again to Howells, this
time with less anguish.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Friday, 1877. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Your letter was a godsend;
and perhaps the welcomest part of it was your consent that I write to
those gentlemen; for you discouraged my hints in that direction that
morning in Boston–rightly, too, for my offense was yet too new, then.
Warner has tried to hold up our hands like the good fellow he is, but
poor Twichell could not say a word, and confessed that he would rather
take nearly any punishment than face Livy and me. He hasn’t been here
since.</p>
<p>It is curious, but I pitched early upon Mr. Norton as the very man
who would think some generous thing about that matter, whether he said
it or not. It is splendid to be a man like that–but it is given to few
to be.</p>
<p>I wrote a letter yesterday, and sent a copy to each of the three. I
wanted to send a copy to Mr. Whittier also, since the offense was done
also against him, being committed in his presence and he the guest of
the occasion, besides holding the well-nigh sacred place he does in his
people’s estimation; but I didn’t know whether to venture or not, and so
ended by doing nothing. It seemed an intrusion to approach him, and even
Livy seemed to have her doubts as to the best and properest way to do in
the case. I do not reverence Mr. Emerson less, but somehow I could
approach him easier.</p>
<p>Send me those proofs, if you have got them handy; I want to submit
them to Wylie; he won’t show them to anybody.</p>
<p>Had a very pleasant and considerate letter from Mr. Houghton, today,
and was very glad to receive it.</p>
<p>You can’t imagine how brilliant and beautiful that new brass fender
is, and how perfectly naturally it takes its place under the carved oak.
How they did scour it up before they sent it! I lied a good deal about
it when I came home–so for once I kept a secret and surprised Livy on a
Christmas morning!</p>
<p>I haven’t done a stroke of work since the Atlantic dinner; have only
moped around. But I’m going to try tomorrow. How could I ever have.</p>
<p>Ah, well, I am a great and sublime fool. But then I am God’s fool,
and all His works must be contemplated with respect.</p>
<p>Livy and I join in the warmest regards to you and yours, Yrs ever,
MARK.</p>
<p>Longfellow, in his reply, said: “I do not believe anybody was much
hurt. Certainly I was not, and Holmes tells me he was not. So I think
you may dismiss the matter from your mind without further remorse.“</p>
<p>Holmes wrote: “It never occurred to me for a moment to take offense,
