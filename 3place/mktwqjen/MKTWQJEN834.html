<h4 id="a-humane-word-from-satan">A HUMANE WORD FROM SATAN</h4>
<p>[The following letter, signed by Satan and purporting to come from
him, we have reason to believe was not written by him, but by Mark
Twain. –Editor.]</p>
<p>TO THE EDITOR OF HARPER’S WEEKLY:</p>
<p>Dear Sir and Kinsman,–Let us have done with this frivolous talk. The
American Board accepts contributions from me every year: then why
shouldn’t it from Mr. Rockefeller? In all the ages, three-fourths of the
support of the great charities has been conscience-money, as my books
will show: then what becomes of the sting when that term is applied to
Mr. Rockefeller’s gift? The American Board’s trade is financed mainly
from the graveyards. Bequests, you understand. Conscience-money.
Confession of an old crime and deliberate perpetration of a new one; for
deceased’s contribution is a robbery of his heirs. Shall the Board
decline bequests because they stand for one of these offenses every time
and generally for both?</p>
<p>Allow me to continue. The charge must persistently and resentfully
and remorselessly dwelt upon is that Mr. Rockefeller’s contribution is
incurably tainted by perjury–perjury proved against him in the courts.
IT MAKES US SMILE–down in my place! Because there isn’t a rich man in
your vast city who doesn’t perjure himself every year before the tax
board. They are all caked with perjury, many layers thick. Iron-clad, so
to speak. If there is one that isn’t, I desire to acquire him for my
museum, and will pay Dinosaur rates. Will you say it isn’t infraction of
the law, but only annual evasion of it? Comfort yourselves with that
nice distinction if you like –FOR THE PRESENT. But by and by, when you
arrive, I will show you something interesting: a whole hell-full of
evaders! Sometimes a frank law-breaker turns up elsewhere, but I get
those others every time.</p>
<p>To return to my muttons. I wish you to remember that my rich
perjurers are contributing to the American Board with frequency: it is
money filched from the sworn-off personal tax; therefore it is the wages
of sin; therefore it is my money; therefore it is <em>I</em> that
contribute it; and, finally, it is therefore as I have said: since the
Board daily accepts contributions from me, why should it decline them
from Mr. Rockefeller, who is as good as I am, let the courts say what
they may?</p>
<p>Satan.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION TO “THE NEW GUIDE OF THE CONVERSATION IN</p>
<p>PORTUGUESE AND ENGLISH“</p>
<p>by Pedro Carolino</p>
<p>In this world of uncertainties, there is, at any rate, one thing
which may be pretty confidently set down as a certainty: and that is,
that this celebrated little phrase-book will never die while the English
language lasts. Its delicious unconscious ridiculousness, and its
enchanting naivete, as are supreme and unapproachable, in their way, as
are Shakespeare’s sublimities. Whatsoever is perfect in its kind, in
literature, is imperishable: nobody can imitate it successfully, nobody
can hope to produce its fellow; it is perfect, it must and will stand
alone: its immortality is secure.</p>
<p>It is one of the smallest books in the world, but few big books have
received such wide attention, and been so much pondered by the grave and
learned, and so much discussed and written about by the thoughtful, the
thoughtless, the wise, and the foolish. Long notices of it have
appeared, from time to time, in the great English reviews, and in
erudite and authoritative philological periodicals; and it has been
laughed at, danced upon, and tossed in a blanket by nearly every
newspaper and magazine in the English-speaking world. Every scribbler,
almost, has had his little fling at it, at one time or another; I had
mine fifteen years ago. The book gets out of print, every now and then,
and one ceases to hear of it for a season; but presently the nations and
near and far colonies of our tongue and lineage call for it once more,
and once more it issues from some London or Continental or American
press, and runs a new course around the globe, wafted on its way by the
wind of a world’s laughter.</p>
<p>Many persons have believed that this book’s miraculous stupidities
were studied and disingenuous; but no one can read the volume carefully
through and keep that opinion. It was written in serious good faith and
deep earnestness, by an honest and upright idiot who believed he knew
something of the English language, and could impart his knowledge to
others. The amplest proof of this crops out somewhere or other upon each
and every page. There are sentences in the book which could have been
manufactured by a man in his right mind, and with an intelligent and
deliberate purposes to seem innocently ignorant; but there are other
sentences, and paragraphs, which no mere pretended ignorance could ever
achieve –nor yet even the most genuine and comprehensive ignorance, when
unbacked by inspiration.</p>
<p>It is not a fraud who speaks in the following paragraph of the
author’s Preface, but a good man, an honest man, a man whose conscience
is at rest, a man who believes he has done a high and worthy work for
his nation and his generation, and is well pleased with his
performance:</p>
<p>We expect then, who the little book (for the care what we wrote him,
and for her typographical correction) that may be worth the acceptation
of the studious persons, and especially of the Youth, at which we
dedicate him particularly.</p>
<p>One cannot open this book anywhere and not find richness. To prove
that this is true, I will open it at random and copy the page I happen
to stumble upon. Here is the result:</p>
<p>DIALOGUE 16</p>
<p>For To See the Town</p>
<p>Anothony, go to accompany they gentilsmen, do they see the town.</p>
<p>We won’t to see all that is it remarquable here.</p>
<p>Come with me, if you please. I shall not folget nothing what can to
merit your attention. Here we are near to cathedral; will you come in
there?</p>
<p>We will first to see him in oudside, after we shall go in there for
to look the interior.</p>
<p>Admire this master piece gothic architecture’s.</p>
<p>The chasing of all they figures is astonishing’ indeed.</p>
<p>The cupola and the nave are not less curious to see.</p>
<p>What is this palace how I see yonder?</p>
<p>It is the town hall.</p>
<p>And this tower here at this side?</p>
<p>It is the Observatory.</p>
<p>The bridge is very fine, it have ten arches, and is constructed of
free stone.</p>
<p>The streets are very layed out by line and too paved.</p>
<p>What is the circuit of this town?</p>
<p>Two leagues.</p>
<p>There is it also hospitals here?</p>
<p>It not fail them.</p>
<p>What are then the edifices the worthest to have seen?</p>
<p>It is the arsnehal, the spectacle’s hall, the Cusiomhouse, and the
Purse.</p>
<p>We are going too see the others monuments such that the public
pawnbroker’s office, the plants garden’s, the money office’s, the
library.</p>
<p>That it shall be for another day; we are tired.</p>
<p>DIALOGUE 17</p>
<p>To Inform One’self of a Person</p>
<p>How is that gentilman who you did speak by and by?</p>
<p>Is a German.</p>
<p>I did think him Englishman.</p>
<p>He is of the Saxony side.</p>
<p>He speak the french very well.</p>
<p>Tough he is German, he speak so much well italyan, french, spanish
and english, that among the Italyans, they believe him Italyan, he speak
the frenche as the Frenches himselves. The Spanishesmen believe him
Spanishing, and the Englishes, Englishman. It is difficult to enjoy well
so much several languages.</p>
<p>The last remark contains a general truth; but it ceases to be a truth
when one contracts it and apples it to an individual–provided that that
individual is the author of this book, Sehnor Pedro Carolino. I am sure
I should not find it difficult “to enjoy well so much several
languages“–or even a thousand of them–if he did the translating for me
from the originals into his ostensible English.</p>
