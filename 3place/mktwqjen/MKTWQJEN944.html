1906, TO VARIOUS PERSONS. THE FAREWELL LECTURE. A SECOND SUMMER IN
DUBLIN. BILLIARDS AND COPYRIGHT</h4>
<p>MARK TWAIN at “Pier Seventy,“ as he called it, paused to look
backward and to record some memoirs of his long, eventful past. The
Autobiography dictations begun in Florence were resumed, and daily he
traveled back, recalling long-ago scenes and all-but-forgotten places.
He was not without reminders. Now and again there came some message that
brought back the old days–the Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn days–or the
romance of the river that he never recalled other than with tenderness
and a tone of regret that it was gone. An invitation to the golden
wedding of two ancient friends moved and saddened him, and his answer to
it conveys about all the story of life.</p>
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Gordon:</p>
<p>21 FIFTH AVENUE, Jan. 24, ’06. DEAR GORDONS,–I have just received
your golden-wedding “At Home“ and am trying to adjust my focus to it and
realize how much it means. It is inconceivable! With a simple sweep it
carries me back over a stretch of time measurable only in astronomical
terms and geological periods. It brings before me Mrs. Gordon, young,
round-limbed, handsome; and with her the Youngbloods and their two
babies, and Laura Wright, that unspoiled little maid, that fresh flower
of the woods and the prairies. Forty-eight years ago!</p>
<p>Life was a fairy-tale, then, it is a tragedy now. When I was 43 and
John Hay 41 he said life was a tragedy after 40, and I disputed it.
Three years ago he asked me to testify again: I counted my graves, and
there was nothing for me to say.</p>
<p>I am old; I recognize it but I don’t realize it. I wonder if a person
ever really ceases to feel young–I mean, for a whole day at a time. My
love to you both, and to all of us that are left. MARK.</p>
<p>Though he used very little liquor of any kind, it was Mark Twain’s
custom to keep a bottle of Scotch whiskey with his collection of pipes
and cigars and tobacco on a little table by his bed-side. During
restless nights he found a small quantity of it conducive to sleep.
Andrew Carnegie, learning of this custom, made it his business to supply
Scotch of his own special importation. The first case came, direct from
Scotland. When it arrived Clemens sent this characteristic
acknowledgment.</p>
<p>To Andrew Carnegie, in Scotland:</p>
<p>21 FIFTH AVE. Feb. 10, ’06. DEAR ST. ANDREW,–The whisky arrived in
due course from over the water; last week one bottle of it was extracted
from the wood and inserted into me, on the instalment plan, with this
result: that I believe it to be the best, smoothest whisky now on the
planet. Thanks, oh, thanks: I have discarded Peruna.</p>
<p>Hoping that you three are well and happy and will be coming back
before the winter sets in. I am, Sincerely yours, MARK.</p>
<p>It must have been a small bottle to be consumed by him in a week, or
perhaps he had able assistance. The next brief line refers to the
manuscript of his article, “Saint Joan of Arc,“ presented to the museum
at Rouen.</p>
<p>To Edward E. Clarke:</p>
<p>21 FIFTH AVE., Feb., 1906. DEAR SIR,–I have found the original
manuscript and with great pleasure I transmit it herewith, also a
printed copy.</p>
<p>It is a matter of great pride to me to have any word of mine
concerning the world’s supremest heroine honored by a place in that
Museum. Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The series of letters which follows was prepared by Mark Twain and
General Fred Grant, mainly with a view of advertising the lecture that
Clemens had agreed to deliver for the benefit of the Robert Fulton
Monument Association. It was, in fact, to be Mark Twain’s “farewell
lecture,“ and the association had really proposed to pay him a thousand
dollars for it. The exchange of these letters, however, was never made
outside of Mark Twain’s bed-room. Propped against the pillows, pen in
hand, with General Grant beside him, they arranged the series with the
idea of publication. Later the plan was discarded, so that this pleasant
foolery appears here for the first, time.</p>
<p>PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL</p>
<p>(Correspondence)</p>
<p>Telegram</p>
<p>Army Headquarters (date) MARK TWAIN, New York,–Would you consider a
proposal to talk at Carnegie Hall for the benefit of the Robert Fulton
Monument Association, of which you are a Vice President, for a fee of a
thousand dollars? F. D. GRANT, President, Fulton Monument
Association.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Answer:</p>
<p>MAJOR-GENERAL F. D. GRANT, Army Headquarters,–I shall be glad to do
it, but I must stipulate that you keep the thousand dollars and add it
to the Monument fund as my contribution. CLEMENS.</p>
