<h4 id="chapter-5-i-want-to-be-a-cub-pilot">Chapter 5 I Want to be a
Cub-pilot</h4>
<p>MONTHS afterward the hope within me struggled to a reluctant death,
and I found myself without an ambition. But I was ashamed to go home. I
was in Cincinnati, and I set to work to map out a new career. I had been
reading about the recent exploration of the river Amazon by an
expedition sent out by our government. It was said that the expedition,
owing to difficulties, had not thoroughly explored a part of the country
lying about the head-waters, some four thousand miles from the mouth of
the river. It was only about fifteen hundred miles from Cincinnati to
New Orleans, where I could doubtless get a ship. I had thirty dollars
left; I would go and complete the exploration of the Amazon. This was
all the thought I gave to the subject. I never was great in matters of
detail. I packed my valise, and took passage on an ancient tub called
the ‘Paul Jones,’ for New Orleans. For the sum of sixteen dollars I had
the scarred and tarnished splendors of ‘her’ main saloon principally to
myself, for she was not a creature to attract the eye of wiser
travelers.</p>
<p>When we presently got under way and went poking down the broad Ohio,
I became a new being, and the subject of my own admiration. I was a
traveler! A word never had tasted so good in my mouth before. I had an
exultant sense of being bound for mysterious lands and distant climes
which I never have felt in so uplifting a degree since. I was in such a
glorified condition that all ignoble feelings departed out of me, and I
was able to look down and pity the untraveled with a compassion that had
hardly a trace of contempt in it. Still, when we stopped at villages and
wood-yards, I could not help lolling carelessly upon the railings of the
boiler deck to enjoy the envy of the country boys on the bank. If they
did not seem to discover me, I presently sneezed to attract their
attention, or moved to a position where they could not help seeing me.
And as soon as I knew they saw me I gaped and stretched, and gave other
signs of being mightily bored with traveling.</p>
<p>I kept my hat off all the time, and stayed where the wind and the sun
could strike me, because I wanted to get the bronzed and weather-beaten
look of an old traveler. Before the second day was half gone I
experienced a joy which filled me with the purest gratitude; for I saw
that the skin had begun to blister and peel off my face and neck. I
wished that the boys and girls at home could see me now.</p>
<p>We reached Louisville in time–at least the neighborhood of it. We
stuck hard and fast on the rocks in the middle of the river, and lay
there four days. I was now beginning to feel a strong sense of being a
part of the boat’s family, a sort of infant son to the captain and
younger brother to the officers. There is no estimating the pride I took
in this grandeur, or the affection that began to swell and grow in me
for those people. I could not know how the lordly steamboatman scorns
that sort of presumption in a mere landsman. I particularly longed to
acquire the least trifle of notice from the big stormy mate, and I was
on the alert for an opportunity to do him a service to that end. It came
at last. The riotous powwow of setting a spar was going on down on the
forecastle, and I went down there and stood around in the way–or mostly
skipping out of it–till the mate suddenly roared a general order for
somebody to bring him a capstan bar. I sprang to his side and said:
‘Tell me where it is–I’ll fetch it!’</p>
<p>If a rag-picker had offered to do a diplomatic service for the
Emperor of Russia, the monarch could not have been more astounded than
the mate was. He even stopped swearing. He stood and stared down at me.
It took him ten seconds to scrape his disjointed remains together again.
Then he said impressively: ‘Well, if this don’t beat hell!’ and turned
to his work with the air of a man who had been confronted with a problem
too abstruse for solution.</p>
<p>I crept away, and courted solitude for the rest of the day. I did not
go to dinner; I stayed away from supper until everybody else had
finished. I did not feel so much like a member of the boat’s family now
as before. However, my spirits returned, in installments, as we pursued
our way down the river. I was sorry I hated the mate so, because it was
not in (young) human nature not to admire him. He was huge and muscular,
his face was bearded and whiskered all over; he had a red woman and a
blue woman tattooed on his right arm,–one on each side of a blue anchor
with a red rope to it; and in the matter of profanity he was sublime.
When he was getting out cargo at a landing, I was always where I could
see and hear. He felt all the majesty of his great position, and made
the world feel it, too. When he gave even the simplest order, he
discharged it like a blast of lightning, and sent a long, reverberating
peal of profanity thundering after it. I could not help contrasting the
way in which the average landsman would give an order, with the mate’s
way of doing it. If the landsman should wish the gang-plank moved a foot
farther forward, he would probably say: ‘James, or William, one of you
push that plank forward, please;’ but put the mate in his place and he
would roar out: ‘Here, now, start that gang-plank for’ard! Lively, now!
WHAT’re you about! Snatch it! SNATCH it! There! there! Aft again! aft
again! don’t you hear me. Dash it to dash! are you going to SLEEP over
it! ’VAST heaving. ’Vast heaving, I tell you! Going to heave it clear
astern? WHERE’re you going with that barrel! FOR’ARD with it ’fore I
make you swallow it, you dash-dash-dash-DASHED split between a tired
mud-turtle and a crippled hearse-horse!’</p>
<p>I wished I could talk like that.</p>
<p>When the soreness of my adventure with the mate had somewhat worn
off, I began timidly to make up to the humblest official connected with
the boat–the night watchman. He snubbed my advances at first, but I
presently ventured to offer him a new chalk pipe; and that softened him.
So he allowed me to sit with him by the big bell on the hurricane deck,
and in time he melted into conversation. He could not well have helped
it, I hung with such homage on his words and so plainly showed that I
felt honored by his notice. He told me the names of dim capes and
shadowy islands as we glided by them in the solemnity of the night,
under the winking stars, and by and by got to talking about himself. He
seemed over-sentimental for a man whose salary was six dollars a week–
or rather he might have seemed so to an older person than I. But I drank
in his words hungrily, and with a faith that might have moved mountains
if it had been applied judiciously. What was it to me that he was soiled
and seedy and fragrant with gin? What was it to me that his grammar was
bad, his construction worse, and his profanity so void of art that it
was an element of weakness rather than strength in his conversation? He
was a wronged man, a man who had seen trouble, and that was enough for
me. As he mellowed into his plaintive history his tears dripped upon the
lantern in his lap, and I cried, too, from sympathy. He said he was the
son of an English nobleman–either an earl or an alderman, he could not
remember which, but believed was both; his father, the nobleman, loved
him, but his mother hated him from the cradle; and so while he was still
a little boy he was sent to ‘one of them old, ancient colleges’–he
couldn’t remember which; and by and by his father died and his mother
seized the property and ‘shook’ him as he phrased it. After his mother
shook him, members of the nobility with whom he was acquainted used
their influence to get him the position of ‘loblolly-boy in a ship;’ and
from that point my watchman threw off all trammels of date and locality
and branched out into a narrative that bristled all along with
incredible adventures; a narrative that was so reeking with bloodshed
and so crammed with hair-breadth escapes and the most engaging and
unconscious personal villainies, that I sat speechless, enjoying,
shuddering, wondering, worshipping.</p>
<p>It was a sore blight to find out afterwards that he was a low,
vulgar, ignorant, sentimental, half-witted humbug, an untraveled native
of the wilds of Illinois, who had absorbed wildcat literature and
appropriated its marvels, until in time he had woven odds and ends of
the mess into this yarn, and then gone on telling it to fledglings like
me, until he had come to believe it himself.</p>
