<h4 id="college-girls">COLLEGE GIRLS</h4>
<p>Five hundred undergraduates, under the auspices of the Woman’s
University Club, New York, welcomed Mr. Clemens as their guest, April 3,
1906, and gave him the freedom of the club, which the chairman explained
was freedom to talk individually to any girl present.</p>
<p>I’ve worked for the public good thirty years, so for the rest of my
life I shall work for my personal contentment. I am glad Miss Neron has
fed me, for there is no telling what iniquity I might wander into on an
empty stomach–I mean, an empty mind.</p>
<p>I am going to tell you a practical story about how once upon a time I
was blind–a story I should have been using all these months, but I never
thought about telling it until the other night, and now it is too late,
for on the nineteenth of this month I hope to take formal leave of the
platform forever at Carnegie Hall–that is, take leave so far as talking
for money and for people who have paid money to hear me talk. I shall
continue to infest the platform on these conditions–that there is nobody
in the house who has paid to hear me, that I am not paid to be heard,
and that there will be none but young women students in the audience.
[Here Mr. Clemens told the story of how he took a girl to the theatre
while he was wearing tight boots, which appears elsewhere in this
volume, and ended by saying: “And now let this be a lesson to you–I
don’t know what kind of a lesson; I’ll let you think it out.“]</p>
<p>GIRLS</p>
<p>In my capacity of publisher I recently received a manuscript from a
teacher which embodied a number of answers given by her pupils to
questions propounded. These answers show that the children had nothing
but the sound to go by–the sense was perfectly empty. Here are some of
their answers to words they were asked to define: Auriferous–pertaining
to an orifice; ammonia–the food of the gods; equestrian–one who asks
questions; parasite–a kind of umbrella; ipecaca–man who likes a good
dinner. And here is the definition of an ancient word honored by a great
party: Republican–a sinner mentioned in the Bible. And here is an
innocent deliverance of a zoological kind: “There are a good many
donkeys in the theological gardens.“ Here also is a definition which
really isn’t very bad in its way: Demagogue–a vessel containing beer and
other liquids. Here, too, is a sample of a boy’s composition on girls,
which, I must say, I rather like:</p>
<p>“Girls are very stuckup and dignified in their manner and behaveyour.
They think more of dress than anything and like to play with dowls and
rags. They cry if they see a cow in a far distance and are afraid of
guns. They stay at home all the time and go to church every Sunday. They
are al-ways sick. They are al-ways furry and making fun of boys hands
and they say how dirty. They cant play marbles. I pity them poor things.
They make fun of boys and then turn round and love them. I don’t belave
they ever kiled a cat or anything. They look out every nite and say,
‘Oh, a’nt the moon lovely!’–Thir is one thing I have not told and that
is they al-ways now their lessons bettern boys.“</p>
<p>THE LADIES</p>
<p>DELIVERED AT THE ANNIVERSARY FESTIVAL, 1872, OF THE SCOTTISH
CORPORATION OF LONDON</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens replied to the toast “The Ladies.“</p>
<p>I am proud, indeed, of the distinction of being chosen to respond to
this especial toast, to “The Ladies,“ or to women if you please, for
that is the preferable term, perhaps; it is certainly the older, and
therefore the more entitled to reverence. I have noticed that the Bible,
with that plain, blunt honesty which is such a conspicuous
characteristic of the Scriptures, is always particular to never refer to
even the illustrious mother of all mankind as a “lady,“ but speaks of
her as a woman. It is odd, but you will find it is so. I am peculiarly
proud of this honor, because I think that the toast to women is one
which, by right and by every rule of gallantry, should take precedence
of all others–of the army, of the navy, of even royalty itself–perhaps,
though the latter is not necessary in this day and in this land, for the
reason that, tacitly, you do drink a broad general health to all good
women when you drink the health of the Queen of England and the Princess
of Wales. I have in mind a poem just now which is familiar to you all,
familiar to everybody. And what an inspiration that was, and how
instantly the present toast recalls the verses to all our minds when the
most noble, the most gracious, the purest, and sweetest of all poets
says:</p>
<p>“Woman! O woman!—er Wom—-“</p>
<p>However, you remember the lines; and you remember how feelingly, how
daintily, how almost imperceptibly the verses raise up before you,
feature by feature, the ideal of a true and perfect woman; and how, as
you contemplate the finished marvel, your homage grows into worship of
the intellect that could create so fair a thing out of mere breath, mere
words. And you call to mind now, as I speak, how the poet, with stern
fidelity to the history of all humanity, delivers this beautiful child
of his heart and his brain over to the trials and sorrows that must come
to all, sooner or later, that abide in the earth, and how the pathetic
story culminates in that apostrophe–so wild, so regretful, so full of
mournful retrospection. The lines run thus:</p>
<p>“Alas!–alas!–a–alas! —-Alas!——–alas!“</p>
<p>–and so on. I do not remember the rest; but, taken together, it seems
to me that poem is the noblest tribute to woman that human genius has
ever brought forth–and I feel that if I were to talk hours I could not
do my great theme completer or more graceful justice than I have now
done in simply quoting that poet’s matchless words. The phases of the
womanly nature are infinite in their variety. Take any type of woman,
and you shall find in it something to respect, something to admire,
something to love. And you shall find the whole joining you heart and
hand. Who was more patriotic than Joan of Arc? Who was braver? Who has
given us a grander instance of self-sacrificing devotion? Ah! you
remember, you remember well, what a throb of pain, what a great tidal
wave of grief swept over us all when Joan of Arc fell at Waterloo. Who
does not sorrow for the loss of Sappho, the sweet singer of Israel? Who
among us does not miss the gentle ministrations, the softening
influences, the humble piety of Lucretia Borgia? Who can join in the
heartless libel that says woman is extravagant in dress when he can look
back and call to mind our simple and lowly mother Eve arrayed in her
modification of the Highland costume? Sir, women have been soldiers,
women have been painters, women have been poets. As long as language
lives the name of Cleopatra will live. And not because she conquered
George III.–but because she wrote those divine lines:</p>
<p>“Let dogs delight to bark and bite, For God hath made them so.“</p>
<p>The story of the world is adorned with the names of illustrious ones
of our own sex–some of, them sons of St. Andrew, too–Scott, Bruce,
Burns, the warrior Wallace, Ben Nevis–the gifted Ben Lomond, and the
great new Scotchman, Ben Disraeli.–[Mr. Benjamin Disraeli, at that time
Prime Minister of England, had just been elected Lord Rector of Glasgow
University, and had made a speech which gave rise to a world of
discussion]–Out of the great plains of history tower whole mountain
ranges of sublime women: the Queen of Sheba, Josephine, Semiramis,
Sairey Gamp; the list is endless–but I will not call the mighty roll,
the names rise up in your own memories at the mere suggestion, luminous
with the glory of deeds that cannot die, hallowed by the loving worship
of the good and the true of all epochs and all climes. Suffice it for
our pride and our honor that we in our day have added to it such names
as those of Grace Darling and Florence Nightingale. Woman is all that
she should be gentle, patient, longsuffering, trustful, unselfish, full
of generous impulses. It is her blessed mission to comfort the
sorrowing, plead for the erring, encourage the faint of purpose, succor
the distressed, uplift the fallen, befriend the friendless–in a word,
afford the healing of her sympathies and a home in her heart for all the
bruised and persecuted children that knock at its hospitable door. And
when I say, God bless her, there is none among us who has known the
ennobling affection of a wife, or the steadfast devotion of a mother but
in his heart will say, Amen!</p>
<p>WOMAN’S PRESS CLUB</p>
<p>On October 27, 1900, the New York Woman’s Press Club gave a tea in
Carnegie Hall. Mr. Clemens was the guest of honor.</p>
<p>If I were asked an opinion I would call this an ungrammatical nation.
There is no such thing as perfect grammar, and I don’t always speak good
grammar myself. But I have been foregathering for the past few days with
professors of American universities, and I’ve heard them all say things
like this: “He don’t like to do it.“ [There was a stir.] Oh, you’ll hear
that to-night if you listen, or, “He would have liked to have done it.“
You’ll catch some educated Americans saying that. When these men take
pen in hand they write with as good grammar as any. But the moment they
throw the pen aside they throw grammatical morals aside with it.</p>
<p>To illustrate the desirability and possibility of concentration, I
must tell you a story of my little six-year-old daughter. The governess
had been teaching her about the reindeer, and, as the custom was, she
related it to the family. She reduced the history of that reindeer to
two or three sentences when the governess could not have put it into a
page. She said: “The reindeer is a very swift animal. A reindeer once
drew a sled four hundred miles in two hours.“ She appended the comment:
“This was regarded as extraordinary.“ And concluded: “When that reindeer
was done drawing that sled four hundred miles in two hours it died.“</p>
<p>As a final instance of the force of limitations in the development of
concentration, I must mention that beautiful creature, Helen Keller,
whom I have known for these many years. I am filled with the wonder of
her knowledge, acquired because shut out from all distraction. If I
could have been deaf, dumb, and blind I also might have arrived at
something.</p>
<p>VOTES FOR WOMEN</p>
<p>AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE HEBREW TECHNICAL SCHOOL FOR GIRLS, HELD
IN THE TEMPLE EMMANUEL, JANUARY 20, 1901</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens was introduced by President Meyer, who said: “In one of
Mr. Clemens’s works he expressed his opinion of men, saying he had no
choice between Hebrew and Gentile, black men or white; to him all men
were alike. But I never could find that he expressed his opinion of
women; perhaps that opinion was so exalted that he could not express it.
We shall now be called to hear what he thinks of women.“</p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,–It is a small help that I can afford, but it is
just such help that one can give as coming from the heart through the
mouth. The report of Mr. Meyer was admirable, and I was as interested in
it as you have been. Why, I’m twice as old as he, and I’ve had so much
experience that I would say to him, when he makes his appeal for help:
“Don’t make it for to-day or to-morrow, but collect the money on the
spot.“</p>
<p>We are all creatures of sudden impulse. We must be worked up by
steam, as it were. Get them to write their wills now, or it may be too
late by -and-by. Fifteen or twenty years ago I had an experience I shall
never forget. I got into a church which was crowded by a sweltering and
panting multitude. The city missionary of our town–Hartford–made a
telling appeal for help. He told of personal experiences among the poor
in cellars and top lofts requiring instances of devotion and help. The
poor are always good to the poor. When a person with his millions gives
a hundred thousand dollars it makes a great noise in the world, but he
does not miss it; it’s the widow’s mite that makes no noise but does the
best work.</p>
<p>I remember on that occasion in the Hartford church the collection was
being taken up. The appeal had so stirred me that I could hardly wait
for the hat or plate to come my way. I had four hundred dollars in my
pocket, and I was anxious to drop it in the plate and wanted to borrow
more. But the plate was so long in coming my way that the fever-heat of
beneficence was going down lower and lower–going down at the rate of a
hundred dollars a minute. The plate was passed too late. When it finally
came to me, my enthusiasm had gone down so much that I kept my four
hundred dollars–and stole a dime from the plate. So, you see, time
sometimes leads to crime.</p>
<p>Oh, many a time have I thought of that and regretted it, and I adjure
you all to give while the fever is on you.</p>
<p>Referring to woman’s sphere in life, I’ll say that woman is always
right. For twenty-five years I’ve been a woman’s rights man. I have
always believed, long before my mother died, that, with her gray hairs
and admirable intellect, perhaps she knew as much as I did. Perhaps she
knew as much about voting as I.</p>
<p>I should like to see the time come when women shall help to make the
laws. I should like to see that whip-lash, the ballot, in the hands of
women. As for this city’s government, I don’t want to say much, except
that it is a shame–a shame; but if I should live twenty-five years
longer–and there is no reason why I shouldn’t–I think I’ll see women
handle the ballot. If women had the ballot to-day, the state of things
in this town would not exist.</p>
<p>If all the women in this town had a vote to-day they would elect a
mayor at the next election, and they would rise in their might and
change the awful state of things now existing here.</p>
<p>WOMAN-AN OPINION</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT AN EARLY BANQUET OF THE WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENTS’
CLUB</p>
<p>The twelfth toast was as follows: “Woman–The pride of any profession,
and the jewel of ours.“</p>
<p>MR. PRESIDENT,–I do not know why I should be singled out to receive
the greatest distinction of the evening–for so the office of replying to
the toast of woman has been regarded in every age. I do not know why I
have received his distinction, unless it be that I am a trifle less
homely than the other members of the club. But be this as it may,
Mr. President, I am proud of the position, and you could not have chosen
any one who would have accepted it more gladly, or labored with a
heartier good-will to do the subject justice than I–because, sir, I love
the sex. I love all the women, irrespective of age or color.</p>
<p>Human intellect cannot estimate what we owe to woman, sir. She sews
on our buttons; she mends our clothes; she ropes us in at the church
fairs; she confides in us; she tells us whatever she can find out about
the little private affairs of the neighbors; she gives us good advice,
and plenty of it; she soothes our aching brows; she bears our
children–ours as a general thing. In all relations of life, sir, it is
but a just and graceful tribute to woman to say of her that she is a
brick.</p>
<p>Wheresoever you place woman, sir–in whatever position or estate–she
is an ornament to the place she occupies, and a treasure to the world.
[Here Mr. Clemens paused, looked inquiringly at his hearers, and
remarked that the applause should come in at this point. It came in. He
resumed his eulogy.] Look at Cleopatra! look at Desdemona!–look at
Florence Nightingale!–look at Joan of Arc!–look at Lucretia Borgia!
[Disapprobation expressed.] Well [said Mr. Clemens, scratching his head,
doubtfully], suppose we let Lucretia slide. Look at Joyce Heth!–look at
Mother Eve! You need not look at her unless you want to, but [said
Mr. Clemens, reflectively, after a pause] Eve was ornamental, sir
–particularly before the fashions changed. I repeat, sir, look at the
illustrious names of history. Look at the Widow Machree!–look at Lucy
Stone!–look at Elizabeth Cady Stanton!–look at George Francis Train!
And, sir, I say it with bowed head and deepest veneration–look at the
mother of Washington! She raised a boy that could not tell a lie–could
not tell a lie! But he never had any chance. It might have been
different if he had belonged to the Washington Newspaper Correspondents’
Club.</p>
<p>I repeat, sir, that in whatever position you place a woman she is an
ornament to society and a treasure to the world. As a sweetheart, she
has few equals and no superiors; as a cousin, she is convenient; as a
wealthy grandmother with an incurable distemper, she is precious; as a
wetnurse, she has no equal among men.</p>
<p>What, sir, would the people of the earth be without woman? They would
be scarce, sir, almighty scarce. Then let us cherish her; let us protect
her; let us give her our support, our encouragement, our sympathy,
ourselves–if we get a chance.</p>
<p>But, jesting aside, Mr. President, woman is lovable, gracious, kind
of heart, beautiful–worthy of all respect, of all esteem, of all
deference. Not any here will refuse to drink her health right cordially
in this bumper of wine, for each and every one has personally known, and
loved, and honored the very best one of them all–his own mother.</p>
<p>ADVICE TO GIRLS</p>
<p>In 1907 a young girl whom Mr. Clemens met on the steamer Minnehaha
called him “grandpa,“ and he called her his granddaughter. She was
attending St. Timothy’s School, at Catonsville, Maryland, and
Mr. Clemens promised her to see her graduate. He accordingly made the
journey from New York on June 10, 1909, and delivered a short
address.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to tell you girls to do. Mr. Martin has told you
everything you ought to do, and now I must give you some don’ts.</p>
<p>There are three things which come to my mind which I consider
excellent advice:</p>
<p>First, girls, don’t smoke–that is, don’t smoke to excess. I am
seventy-three and a half years old, and have been smoking seventy-three
of them. But I never smoke to excess–that is, I smoke in moderation,
only one cigar at a time.</p>
<p>Second, don’t drink–that is, don’t drink to excess.</p>
<p>Third, don’t marry–I mean, to excess.</p>
<p>Honesty is the best policy. That is an old proverb; but you don’t
want ever to forget it in your journey through life.</p>
<p>TAXES AND MORALS</p>
<p>ADDRESS DELIVERED IN NEW YORK, JANUARY 22, 1906</p>
<p>At the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of Tuskeegee
Institute by Booker Washington, Mr. Choate presided, and in introducing
Mr. Clemens made fun of him because he made play his work, and that when
he worked hardest he did so lying in bed.</p>
<p>I came here in the responsible capacity of policeman to watch
Mr. Choate. This is an occasion of grave and serious importance, and it
seems necessary for me to be present, so that if he tried to work off
any statement that required correction, reduction, refutation, or
exposure, there would be a tried friend of the public to protect the
house. He has not made one statement whose veracity fails to tally
exactly with my own standard. I have never seen a person improve so.
This makes me thankful and proud of a country that can produce such
men–two such men. And all in the same country. We can’t be with you
always; we are passing away, and then–well, everything will have to
stop, I reckon. It is a sad thought. But in spirit I shall still be with
you. Choate, too–if he can.</p>
<p>Every born American among the eighty millions, let his creed or
destitution of creed be what it may, is indisputably a Christian–to this
degree that his moral constitution is Christian.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of Christian morals, one private and the other
public. These two are so distinct, so unrelated, that they are no more
akin to each other than are archangels and politicians. During three
hundred and sixty-three days in the year the American citizen is true to
his Christian private morals, and keeps undefiled the nation’s character
at its best and highest; then in the other two days of the year he
leaves his Christian private morals at home and carries his Christian
public morals to the tax office and the polls, and does the best he can
to damage and undo his whole year’s faithful and righteous work. Without
a blush he will vote for an unclean boss if that boss is his party’s
Moses, without compunction he will vote against the best man in the
whole land if he is on the other ticket. Every year in a number of
cities and States he helps put corrupt men in office, whereas if he
would but throw away his Christian public morals, and carry his
Christian private morals to the polls, he could promptly purify the
public service and make the possession of office a high and honorable
distinction.</p>
<p>Once a year he lays aside his Christian private morals and hires a
ferry-boat and piles up his bonds in a warehouse in New Jersey for three
days, and gets out his Christian public morals and goes to the tax
office and holds up his hands and swears he wishes he may never–never if
he’s got a cent in the world, so help him. The next day the list appears
in the papers–a column and a quarter of names, in fine print, and every
man in the list a billionaire and member of a couple of churches. I know
all those people. I have friendly, social, and criminal relations with
the whole lot of them. They never miss a sermon when they are so’s to be
around, and they never miss swearing-off day, whether they are so’s to
be around or not.</p>
<p>I used to be an honest man. I am crumbling. No–I have crumbled. When
they assessed me at 5,000 a fortnight ago I went out and tried to borrow
the money, and couldn’t; then when I found they were letting a whole
crop of millionaires live in New York at a third of the price they were
charging me I was hurt, I was indignant, and said: “This is the last
feather. I am not going to run this town all by myself.“ In that
moment–in that memorable moment–I began to crumble. In fifteen minutes
the disintegration was complete. In fifteen minutes I had become just a
mere moral sand-pile; and I lifted up my hand along with those seasoned
and experienced deacons and swore off every rag of personal property
I’ve got in the world, clear down to cork leg, glass eye, and what is
left of my wig.</p>
<p>Those tax officers were moved; they were profoundly moved. They had
long been accustomed to seeing hardened old grafters act like that, and
they could endure the spectacle; but they were expecting better things
of me, a chartered, professional moralist, and they were saddened.</p>
<p>I fell visibly in their respect and esteem, and I should have fallen
in my own, except that I had already struck bottom, and there wasn’t any
place to fall to.</p>
<p>At Tuskeegee they will jump to misleading conclusions from
insufficient evidence, along with Doctor Parkhurst, and they will
deceive the student with the superstition that no gentleman ever
swears.</p>
<p>Look at those good millionaires; aren’t they gentlemen? Well, they
swear. Only once in a year, maybe, but there’s enough bulk to it to make
up for the lost time. And do they lose anything by it? No, they don’t;
they save enough in three minutes to support the family seven years.
When they swear, do we shudder? No–unless they say “damn!“ Then we do.
It shrivels us all up. Yet we ought not to feel so about it, because we
all swear–everybody. Including the ladies. Including Doctor Parkhurst,
that strong and brave and excellent citizen, but superficially
educated.</p>
<p>For it is not the word that is the sin, it is the spirit back of the
word. When an irritated lady says “oh!“ the spirit back of it is “damn!“
and that is the way it is going to be recorded against her. It always
makes me so sorry when I hear a lady swear like that. But if she says
“damn,“ and says it in an amiable, nice way, it isn’t going to be
recorded at all.</p>
<p>The idea that no gentleman ever swears is all wrong; he can swear and
still be a gentleman if he does it in a nice and, benevolent and
affectionate way. The historian, John Fiske, whom I knew well and loved,
was a spotless and most noble and upright Christian gentleman, and yet
he swore once. Not exactly that, maybe; still, he–but I will tell you
about it.</p>
<p>One day, when he was deeply immersed in his work, his wife came in,
much moved and profoundly distressed, and said: “I am sorry to disturb
you, John, but I must, for this is a serious matter, and needs to be
attended to at once.“</p>
<p>Then, lamenting, she brought a grave accusation against their little
son. She said: “He has been saying his Aunt Mary is a fool and his Aunt
Martha is a damned fool.“ Mr. Fiske reflected upon the matter a minute,
then said: “Oh, well, it’s about the distinction I should make between
them myself.“</p>
<p>Mr. Washington, I beg you to convey these teachings to your great and
prosperous and most beneficent educational institution, and add them to
the prodigal mental and moral riches wherewith you equip your fortunate
proteges for the struggle of life.</p>
<p>TAMMANY AND CROKER</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens made his debut as a campaign orator on October 7, 1901,
advocating the election of Seth Low for Mayor, not as a Republican, but
as a member of the “Acorns,“ which he described as a “third party having
no political affiliation, but was concerned only in the selection of the
best candidates and the best member.“</p>
<p>Great Britain had a Tammany and a Croker a good while ago. This
Tammany was in India, and it began its career with the spread of the
English dominion after the Battle of Plassey. Its first boss was Clive,
a sufficiently crooked person sometimes, but straight as a yard stick
when compared with the corkscrew crookedness of the second boss, Warren
Hastings.</p>
<p>That old-time Tammany was the East India Company’s government, and
had its headquarters at Calcutta. Ostensibly it consisted of a Great
Council of four persons, of whom one was the Governor-General, Warren
Hastings; really it consisted of one person–Warren Hastings; for by
usurpation he concentrated all authority in himself and governed the
country like an autocrat.</p>
<p>Ostensibly the Court of Directors, sitting in London and representing
the vast interests of the stockholders, was supreme in authority over
the Calcutta Great Council, whose membership it appointed and removed at
pleasure, whose policies it dictated, and to whom it conveyed its will
in the form of sovereign commands; but whenever it suited Hastings, he
ignored even that august body’s authority and conducted the mighty
affairs of the British Empire in India to suit his own notions.</p>
<p>At his mercy was the daily bread of every official, every trader,
every clerk, every civil servant, big and little, in the whole huge
India Company’s machine, and the man who hazarded his bread by any
failure of subserviency to the boss lost it.</p>
<p>Now then, let the supreme masters of British India, the giant
corporation of the India Company of London, stand for the voters of the
city of New York; let the Great Council of Calcutta stand for Tammany;
let the corrupt and money-grubbing great hive of serfs which served
under the Indian Tammany’s rod stand for New York Tammany’s serfs; let
Warren Hastings stand for Richard Croker, and it seems to me that the
parallel is exact and complete. And so let us be properly grateful and
thank God and our good luck that we didn’t invent Tammany.</p>
<p>Edmund Burke, regarded by many as the greatest orator of all times,
conducted the case against Warren Hastings in that renowned trial which
lasted years, and which promises to keep its renown for centuries to
come. I wish to quote some of the things he said. I wish to imagine him
arraigning Mr. Croker and Tammany before the voters of New York City and
pleading with them for the overthrow of that combined iniquity of the
5th of November, and will substitute for “My Lords,“ read
“Fellow-Citizens“; for “Kingdom,“ read “City“; for “Parliamentary
Process,“ read “Political Campaign“; for “Two Houses,“ read “Two
Parties,“ and so it reads:</p>
<p>“Fellow–citizens, I must look upon it as an auspicious circumstance
to this cause, in which the honor of the city is involved, that from the
first commencement of our political campaign to this the hour of solemn
trial not the smallest difference of opinion has arisen, between the two
parties.</p>
<p>“You will see, in the progress of this cause, that there is not only
a long, connected, systematic series of misdemeanors, but an equally
connected system of maxims and principles invented to justify them. Upon
both of these you must judge.</p>
<p>“It is not only the interest of the city of New York, now the most
considerable part of the city of the Americans, which is concerned, but
the credit and honor of the nation itself will be decided by this
decision.“</p>
<p>At a later meeting of the Acorn Club, Mr. Clemens said:</p>
<p>Tammany is dead, and there’s no use in blackguarding a corpse.</p>
<p>The election makes me think of a story of a man who was dying. He had
only two minutes to live, so he sent for a clergyman and asked him,
“Where is the best place to go to?“ He was undecided about it. So the
minister told him that each place had its advantages–heaven for climate,
and hell for society.</p>
<p>MUNICIPAL CORRUPTION</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE CITY CLUB DINNER, JANUARY 4,1901</p>
<p>Bishop Potter told how an alleged representative of Tammany Hall
asked him in effect if he would cease his warfare upon the Police
Department if a certain captain and inspector were dismissed. He replied
that he would never be satisfied until the “man at the top“ and the
“system“ which permitted evils in the Police Department were
crushed.</p>
<p>The Bishop has just spoken of a condition of things which none of us
can deny, and which ought not to exist; that is, the lust of gain–a lust
which does not stop short of the penitentiary or the jail to accomplish
its ends. But we may be sure of one thing, and that is that this sort of
thing is not universal. If it were, this country would not be. You may
put this down as a fact: that out of every fifty men, forty-nine are
clean. Then why is it, you may ask, that the forty-nine don’t have
things the way they want them? I’ll tell you why it is. A good deal has
been said here to-night about what is to be accomplished by
organization. That’s just the thing. It’s because the fiftieth fellow
and his pals are organized and the other forty-nine are not that the
dirty one rubs it into the clean fellows every time.</p>
<p>You may say organize, organize, organize; but there may be so much
organization that it will interfere with the work to be done. The Bishop
here had an experience of that sort, and told all about it down-town the
other night. He was painting a barn–it was his own barn–and yet he was
informed that his work must stop; he was a non-union painter, and
couldn’t continue at that sort of job.</p>
<p>Now, all these conditions of which you complain should be remedied,
and I am here to tell you just how to do it. I’ve been a statesman
without salary for many years, and I have accomplished great and
widespread good. I don’t know that it has benefited anybody very much,
even if it was good; but I do know that it hasn’t harmed me very much,
and is hasn’t made me any richer.</p>
<p>We hold the balance of power. Put up your best men for office, and we
shall support the better one. With the election of the best man for
Mayor would follow the selection of the best man for Police Commissioner
and Chief of Police.</p>
<p>My first lesson in the craft of statesmanship was taken at an early
age. Fifty-one years ago I was fourteen years old, and we had a society
in the town I lived in, patterned after the Freemasons, or the Ancient
Order of United Farmers, or some such thing–just what it was patterned
after doesn’t matter. It had an inside guard and an outside guard, and a
past-grand warden, and a lot of such things, so as to give dignity to
the organization and offices to the members.</p>
<p>Generally speaking it was a pretty good sort of organization, and
some of the very best boys in the village, including–but I mustn’t get
personal on an occasion like this–and the society would have got along
pretty well had it not been for the fact that there were a certain
number of the members who could be bought. They got to be an infernal
nuisance. Every time we had an election the candidates had to go around
and see the purchasable members. The price per vote was paid in
doughnuts, and it depended somewhat on the appetites of the individuals
as to the price of the votes.</p>
<p>This thing ran along until some of us, the really very best boys in
the organization, decided that these corrupt practices must stop, and
for the purpose of stopping them we organized a third party. We had a
name, but we were never known by that name. Those who didn’t like us
called us the Anti-Doughnut party, but we didn’t mind that.</p>
<p>We said: “Call us what you please; the name doesn’t matter. We are
organized for a principle.“ By-and-by the election came around, and we
made a big mistake. We were triumphantly beaten. That taught us a
lesson. Then and there we decided never again to nominate anybody for
anything. We decided simply to force the other two parties in the
society to nominate their very best men. Although we were organized for
a principle, we didn’t care much about that. Principles aren’t of much
account anyway, except at election-time. After that you hang them up to
let them season.</p>
<p>The next time we had an election we told both the other parties that
we’d beat any candidates put up by any one of them of whom we didn’t
approve. In that election we did business. We got the man we wanted. I
suppose they called us the Anti-Doughnut party because they couldn’t buy
us with their doughnuts. They didn’t have enough of them. Most reformers
arrive at their price sooner or later, and I suppose we would have had
our price; but our opponents weren’t offering anything but doughnuts,
and those we spurned.</p>
<p>Now it seems to me that an Anti-Doughnut party is just what is wanted
in the present emergency. I would have the Anti-Doughnuts felt in every
city and hamlet and school district in this State and in the United
States. I was an Anti-Doughnut in my boyhood, and I’m an Anti-Doughnut
still. The modern designation is Mugwump. There used to be quite a
number of us Mugwumps, but I think I’m the only one left. I had a vote
this fall, and I began to make some inquiries as to what I had better do
with it.</p>
<p>I don’t know anything about finance, and I never did, but I know some
pretty shrewd financiers, and they told me that Mr. Bryan wasn’t safe on
any financial question. I said to myself, then, that it wouldn’t do for
me to vote for Bryan, and I rather thought–I know now–that McKinley
wasn’t just right on this Philippine question, and so I just didn’t vote
for anybody. I’ve got that vote yet, and I’ve kept it clean, ready to
deposit at some other election. It wasn’t cast for any wildcat financial
theories, and it wasn’t cast to support the man who sends our boys as
volunteers out into the Philippines to get shot down under a polluted
flag.</p>
<p>MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE ANNUAL DINNER OF THE ST. NICHOLAS SOCIETY, NEW YORK,
DECEMBER 6, 1900</p>
<p>Doctor Mackay, in his response to the toast “St. Nicholas,“ referred
to Mr. Clemens, saying:–“Mark Twain is as true a preacher of true
righteousness as any bishop, priest, or minister of any church to-day,
because he moves men to forget their faults by cheerful well-doing
instead of making them sour and morbid by everlastingly bending their
attention to the seamy and sober side of life.“</p>
<p>MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN OF THE ST. NICHOLAS SOCIETY,–These are,
indeed, prosperous days for me. Night before last, in a speech, the
Bishop of the Diocese of New York complimented me for my contribution to
theology, and to-night the Reverend Doctor Mackay has elected me to the
ministry. I thanked Bishop Potter then for his compliment, and I thank
Doctor Mackay now for that promotion. I think that both have discerned
in me what I long ago discerned, but what I was afraid the world would
never learn to recognize.</p>
<p>In this absence of nine years I find a great improvement in the city
of New York. I am glad to speak on that as a toast–“The City of New
York.“ Some say it has improved because I have been away. Others, and I
agree with them, say it has improved because I have come back. We must
judge of a city, as of a man, by its external appearances and by its
inward character. In externals the foreigner coming to these shores is
more impressed at first by our sky-scrapers. They are new to him. He has
not done anything of the sort since he built the tower of Babel. The
foreigner is shocked by them.</p>
<p>In the daylight they are ugly. They are–well, too chimneyfied and too
snaggy–like a mouth that needs attention from a dentist; like a cemetery
that is all monuments and no gravestones. But at night, seen from the
river where they are columns towering against the sky, all sparkling
with light, they are fairylike; they are beauty more satisfactory to the
soul and more enchanting than anything that man has dreamed of since the
Arabian nights. We can’t always have the beautiful aspect of things. Let
us make the most of our sights that are beautiful and let the others go.
When your foreigner makes disagreeable comments on New York by daylight,
float him down the river at night.</p>
<p>What has made these sky-scrapers possible is the elevator. The
cigar-box which the European calls a “lift“ needs but to be compared
with our elevators to be appreciated. The lift stops to reflect between
floors. That is all right in a hearse, but not in elevators. The
American elevator acts like the man’s patent purge–it worked. As the
inventor said, “This purge doesn’t waste any time fooling around; it
attends strictly to business.“</p>
<p>That New-Yorkers have the cleanest, quickest, and most admirable
system of street railways in the world has been forced upon you by the
abnormal appreciation you have of your hackman. We ought always to be
grateful to him for that service. Nobody else would have brought such a
system into existence for us. We ought to build him a monument. We owe
him one as much as we owe one to anybody. Let it be a tall one. Nothing
permanent, of course; build it of plaster, say. Then gaze at it and
realize how grateful we are–for the time being–and then pull it down and
throw it on the ash-heap. That’s the way to honor your public
heroes.</p>
<p>As to our streets, I find them cleaner than they used to be. I miss
those dear old landmarks, the symmetrical mountain ranges of dust and
dirt that used to be piled up along the streets for the wind and rain to
tear down at their pleasure. Yes, New York is cleaner than Bombay. I
realize that I have been in Bombay, that I now am in New York; that it
is not my duty to flatter Bombay, but rather to flatter New York.</p>
<p>Compared with the wretched attempts of London to light that city, New
York may fairly be said to be a well-lighted city. Why, London’s attempt
at good lighting is almost as bad as London’s attempt at rapid transit.
There is just one good system of rapid transit in London–the “Tube,“ and
that, of course, had been put in by Americans. Perhaps, after a while,
those Americans will come back and give New York also a good underground
system. Perhaps they have already begun. I have been so busy since I
came back that I haven’t had time as yet to go down cellar.</p>
<p>But it is by the laws of the city, it is by the manners of the city,
it is by the ideals of the city, it is by the customs of the city and by
the municipal government which all these elements correct, support, and
foster, by which the foreigner judges the city. It is by these that he
realizes that New York may, indeed, hold her head high among the cities
of the world. It is by these standards that he knows whether to class
the city higher or lower than the other municipalities of the world.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you have the best municipal government in the world–the
purest and the most fragrant. The very angels envy you, and wish they
could establish a government like it in heaven. You got it by a noble
fidelity to civic duty. You got it by stern and ever-watchful exertion
of the great powers with which you are charged by the rights which were
handed down to you by your forefathers, by your manly refusal to let
base men invade the high places of your government, and by instant
retaliation when any public officer has insulted you in the city’s name
by swerving in the slightest from the upright and full performance of
his duty. It is you who have made this city the envy of the cities of
the world. God will bless you for it–God will bless you for it. Why,
when you approach the final resting-place the angels of heaven will
gather at the gates and cry out:</p>
<p>“Here they come! Show them to the archangel’s box, and turn the
lime-light on them!“</p>
<p>CHINA AND THE PHILIPPINES</p>
<p>AT A DINNER GIVEN IN THE WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL, DECEMBER, 1900</p>
<p>Winston Spencer Churchill was introduced by Mr. Clemens.</p>
<p>For years I’ve been a self-appointed missionary to bring about the
union of America and the motherland. They ought to be united. Behold
America, the refuge of the oppressed from everywhere (who can pay fifty
dollars’ admission)–any one except a Chinaman–standing up for human
rights everywhere, even helping China let people in free when she wants
to collect fifty dollars upon them. And how unselfishly England has
wrought for the open door for all! And how piously America has wrought
for that open door in all cases where it was not her own!</p>
<p>Yes, as a missionary I’ve sung my songs of praise. And yet I think
that England sinned when she got herself into a war in South Africa
which she could have avoided, just as we sinned in getting into a
similar war in the Philippines. Mr. Churchill, by his father, is an
Englishman; by his mother he is an American–no doubt a blend that makes
the perfect man. England and America; yes, we are kin. And now that we
are also kin in sin, there is nothing more to be desired. The harmony is
complete, the blend is perfect.</p>
<p>THEORETICAL MORALS</p>
<p>The New Vagabonds Club of London, made up of the leading younger
literary men of the day, gave a dinner in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Clemens,
July 8, 1899.</p>
<p>It has always been difficult–leave that word difficult–not
exceedingly difficult, but just difficult, nothing more than that, not
the slightest shade to add to that–just difficult–to respond properly,
in the right phraseology, when compliments are paid to me; but it is
more than difficult when the compliments are paid to a better than I–my
wife.</p>
<p>And while I am not here to testify against myself–I can’t be expected
to do so, a prisoner in your own country is not admitted to do so–as to
which member of the family wrote my books, I could say in general that
really I wrote the books myself. My wife puts the facts in, and they
make it respectable. My modesty won’t suffer while compliments are being
paid to literature, and through literature to my family. I can’t get
enough of them.</p>
<p>I am curiously situated to-night. It so rarely happens that I am
introduced by a humorist; I am generally introduced by a person of grave
walk and carriage. That makes the proper background of gravity for
brightness. I am going to alter to suit, and haply I may say some
humorous things.</p>
<p>When you start with a blaze of sunshine and upburst of humor, when
you begin with that, the proper office of humor is to reflect, to put
you into that pensive mood of deep thought, to make you think of your
sins, if you wish half an hour to fly. Humor makes me reflect now
to-night, it sets the thinking machinery in motion. Always, when I am
thinking, there come suggestions of what I am, and what we all are, and
what we are coming to. A sermon comes from my lips always when I listen
to a humorous speech.</p>
<p>I seize the opportunity to throw away frivolities, to say something
to plant the seed, and make all better than when I came. In
Mr. Grossmith’s remarks there was a subtle something suggesting my
favorite theory of the difference between theoretical morals and
practical morals. I try to instil practical morals in the place of
theatrical–I mean theoretical; but as an addendum–an annex–something
added to theoretical morals.</p>
<p>When your chairman said it was the first time he had ever taken the
chair, he did not mean that he had not taken lots of other things; he
attended my first lecture and took notes. This indicated the man’s
disposition. There was nothing else flying round, so he took notes; he
would have taken anything he could get.</p>
<p>I can bring a moral to bear here which shows the difference between
theoretical morals and practical morals. Theoretical morals are the sort
you get on your mother’s knee, in good books, and from the pulpit. You
gather them in your head, and not in your heart; they are theory without
practice. Without the assistance of practice to perfect them, it is
difficult to teach a child to “be honest, don’t steal.“</p>
<p>I will teach you how it should be done, lead you into temptation,
teach you how to steal, so that you may recognize when you have stolen
and feel the proper pangs. It is no good going round and bragging you
have never taken the chair.</p>
<p>As by the fires of experience, so by commission of crime, you learn
real morals. Commit all the crimes, familiarize yourself with all sins,
take them in rotation (there are only two or three thousand of them),
stick to it, commit two or three every day, and by-and-by you will be
proof against them. When you are through you will be proof against all
sins and morally perfect. You will be vaccinated against every possible
commission of them. This is the only way.</p>
<p>I will read you a written statement upon the subject that I wrote
three years ago to read to the Sabbath-schools. [Here the lecturer
turned his pockets out, but without success.] No! I have left it at
home. Still, it was a mere statement of fact, illustrating the value of
practical morals produced by the commission of crime.</p>
<p>It was in my boyhood just a statement of fact, reading is only more
formal, merely facts, merely pathetic facts, which I can state so as to
be understood. It relates to the first time I ever stole a watermelon;
that is, I think it was the first time; anyway, it was right along there
somewhere.</p>
<p>I stole it out of a farmer’s wagon while he was waiting on another
customer. “Stole“ is a harsh term. I withdrew–I retired that watermelon.
I carried it to a secluded corner of a lumber-yard. I broke it open. It
was green–the greenest watermelon raised in the valley that year.</p>
<p>The minute I saw it was green I was sorry, and began to reflect
–reflection is the beginning of reform. If you don’t reflect when you
commit a crime then that crime is of no use; it might just as well have
been committed by some one else: You must reflect or the value is lost;
you are not vaccinated against committing it again.</p>
<p>I began to reflect. I said to myself: “What ought a boy to do who has
stolen a green watermelon? What would George Washington do, the father
of his country, the only American who could not tell a lie? What would
he do? There is only one right, high, noble thing for any boy to do who
has stolen a watermelon of that class he must make restitution; he must
restore that stolen property to its rightful owner.“ I said I would do
it when I made that good resolution. I felt it to be a noble, uplifting
obligation. I rose up spiritually stronger and refreshed. I carried that
watermelon back–what was left of it–and restored it to the farmer, and
made him give me a ripe one in its place.</p>
<p>Now you see that this constant impact of crime upon crime protects
you against further commission of crime. It builds you up. A man can’t
become morally perfect by stealing one or a thousand green watermelons,
but every little helps.</p>
<p>I was at a great school yesterday (St. Paul’s), where for four
hundred years they have been busy with brains, and building up England
by producing Pepys, Miltons, and Marlboroughs. Six hundred boys left to
nothing in the world but theoretical morality. I wanted to become the
professor of practical morality, but the high master was away, so I
suppose I shall have to go on making my living the same old way–by
adding practical to theoretical morality.</p>
<p>What are the glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome,
compared to the glory and grandeur and majesty of a perfected morality
such as you see before you?</p>
<p>The New Vagabonds are old vagabonds (undergoing the old sort of
reform). You drank my health; I hope I have not been unuseful. Take this
system of morality to your hearts. Take it home to your neighbors and
your graves, and I hope that it will be a long time before you arrive
there.</p>
