<h4 id="chapter-xli.">CHAPTER XLI.</h4>
<p>There is an old-time toast which is golden for its beauty. “When you
ascend the hill of prosperity may you not meet a friend.“ –Pudd’nhead
Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>The next picture that drifts across the field of my memory is one
which is connected with religious things. We were taken by friends to
see a Jain temple. It was small, and had many flags or streamers flying
from poles standing above its roof; and its little battlements supported
a great many small idols or images. Upstairs, inside, a solitary Jain
was praying or reciting aloud in the middle of the room. Our presence
did not interrupt him, nor even incommode him or modify his fervor. Ten
or twelve feet in front of him was the idol, a small figure in a sitting
posture. It had the pinkish look of a wax doll, but lacked the doll’s
roundness of limb and approximation to correctness of form and justness
of proportion. Mr. Gandhi explained every thing to us. He was delegate
to the Chicago Fair Congress of Religions. It was lucidly done, in
masterly English, but in time it faded from me, and now I have nothing
left of that episode but an impression: a dim idea of a religious belief
clothed in subtle intellectual forms, lofty and clean, barren of fleshly
grossnesses; and with this another dim impression which connects that
intellectual system somehow with that crude image, that inadequate idol
–how, I do not know. Properly they do not seem to belong together.
Apparently the idol symbolized a person who had become a saint or a god
through accessions of steadily augmenting holiness acquired through a
series of reincarnations and promotions extending over many ages; and
was now at last a saint and qualified to vicariously receive worship and
transmit it to heaven’s chancellery. Was that it?</p>
<p>And thence we went to Mr. Premchand Roychand’s bungalow, in Lovelane,
Byculla, where an Indian prince was to receive a deputation of the Jain
community who desired to congratulate him upon a high honor lately
conferred upon him by his sovereign, Victoria, Empress of India. She had
made him a knight of the order of the Star of India. It would seem that
even the grandest Indian prince is glad to add the modest title “Sir“ to
his ancient native grandeurs, and is willing to do valuable service to
win it. He will remit taxes liberally, and will spend money freely upon
the betterment of the condition of his subjects, if there is a
knighthood to be gotten by it. And he will also do good work and a deal
of it to get a gun added to the salute allowed him by the British
Government. Every year the Empress distributes knighthoods and adds guns
for public services done by native princes. The salute of a small prince
is three or four guns; princes of greater consequence have salutes that
run higher and higher, gun by gun,–oh, clear away up to eleven; possibly
more, but I did not hear of any above eleven-gun princes. I was told
that when a four-gun prince gets a gun added, he is pretty troublesome
for a while, till the novelty wears off, for he likes the music, and
keeps hunting up pretexts to get himself saluted. It may be that
supremely grand folk, like the Nyzam of Hyderabad and the Gaikwar of
Baroda, have more than eleven guns, but I don’t know.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the bungalow, the large hall on the ground floor
was already about full, and carriages were still flowing into the
grounds. The company present made a fine show, an exhibition of human
fireworks, so to speak, in the matters of costume and comminglings of
brilliant color. The variety of form noticeable in the display of
turbans was remarkable. We were told that the explanation of this was,
that this Jain delegation was drawn from many parts of India, and that
each man wore the turban that was in vogue in his own region. This
diversity of turbans made a beautiful effect.</p>
<p>I could have wished to start a rival exhibition there, of Christian
hats and clothes. I would have cleared one side of the room of its
Indian splendors and repacked the space with Christians drawn from
America, England, and the Colonies, dressed in the hats and habits of
now, and of twenty and forty and fifty years ago. It would have been a
hideous exhibition, a thoroughly devilish spectacle. Then there would
have been the added disadvantage of the white complexion. It is not an
unbearably unpleasant complexion when it keeps to itself, but when it
comes into competition with masses of brown and black the fact is
betrayed that it is endurable only because we are used to it. Nearly all
black and brown skins are beautiful, but a beautiful white skin is rare.
How rare, one may learn by walking down a street in Paris, New York, or
London on a week-day particularly an unfashionable street–and keeping
count of the satisfactory complexions encountered in the course of a
mile. Where dark complexions are massed, they make the whites look
bleached-out, unwholesome, and sometimes frankly ghastly. I could notice
this as a boy, down South in the slavery days before the war. The
splendid black satin skin of the South African Zulus of Durban seemed to
me to come very close to perfection. I can see those Zulus yet–’ricksha
athletes waiting in front of the hotel for custom; handsome and
intensely black creatures, moderately clothed in loose summer stuffs
whose snowy whiteness made the black all the blacker by contrast.
Keeping that group in my mind, I can compare those complexions with the
white ones which are streaming past this London window now:</p>
<p>A lady. Complexion, new parchment. Another lady. Complexion, old
parchment.</p>
<p>Another. Pink and white, very fine.</p>
<p>Man. Grayish skin, with purple areas.</p>
<p>Man. Unwholesome fish-belly skin.</p>
<p>Girl. Sallow face, sprinkled with freckles.</p>
<p>Old woman. Face whitey-gray.</p>
<p>Young butcher. Face a general red flush.</p>
<p>Jaundiced man–mustard yellow.</p>
<p>Elderly lady. Colorless skin, with two conspicuous moles.</p>
<p>Elderly man–a drinker. Boiled-cauliflower nose in a flabby face
veined with purple crinklings.</p>
<p>Healthy young gentleman. Fine fresh complexion.</p>
<p>Sick young man. His face a ghastly white.</p>
<p>No end of people whose skins are dull and characterless modifications
of the tint which we miscall white. Some of these faces are pimply; some
exhibit other signs of diseased blood; some show scars of a tint out of
a harmony with the surrounding shades of color. The white man’s
complexion makes no concealments. It can’t. It seemed to have been
designed as a catch-all for everything that can damage it. Ladies have
to paint it, and powder it, and cosmetic it, and diet it with arsenic,
and enamel it, and be always enticing it, and persuading it, and
pestering it, and fussing at it, to make it beautiful; and they do not
succeed. But these efforts show what they think of the natural
complexion, as distributed. As distributed it needs these helps. The
complexion which they try to counterfeit is one which nature restricts
to the few–to the very few. To ninety-nine persons she gives a bad
complexion, to the hundredth a good one. The hundredth can keep it–how
long? Ten years, perhaps.</p>
<p>The advantage is with the Zulu, I think. He starts with a beautiful
complexion, and it will last him through. And as for the Indian brown
–firm, smooth, blemishless, pleasant and restful to the eye, afraid of
no color, harmonizing with all colors and adding a grace to them all–I
think there is no sort of chance for the average white complexion
against that rich and perfect tint.</p>
<p>To return to the bungalow. The most gorgeous costume present were
worn by some children. They seemed to blaze, so bright were the colors,
and so brilliant the jewels strum over the rich materials. These
children were professional nautch-dancers, and looked like girls, but
they were boys, They got up by ones and twos and fours, and danced and
sang to an accompaniment of weird music. Their posturings and gesturings
were elaborate and graceful, but their voices were stringently raspy and
unpleasant, and there was a good deal of monotony about the tune.</p>
<p>By and by there was a burst of shouts and cheers outside and the
prince with his train entered in fine dramatic style. He was a stately
man, he was ideally costumed, and fairly festooned with ropes of gems;
some of the ropes were of pearls, some were of uncut great
emeralds–emeralds renowned in Bombay for their quality and value. Their
size was marvelous, and enticing to the eye, those rocks. A boy–a
princeling –was with the prince, and he also was a radiant
exhibition.</p>
<p>The ceremonies were not tedious. The prince strode to his throne with
the port and majesty–and the sternness–of a Julius Caesar coming to
receive and receipt for a back-country kingdom and have it over and get
out, and no fooling. There was a throne for the young prince, too, and
the two sat there, side by side, with their officers grouped at either
hand and most accurately and creditably reproducing the pictures which
one sees in the books–pictures which people in the prince’s line of
business have been furnishing ever since Solomon received the Queen of
Sheba and showed her his things. The chief of the Jain delegation read
his paper of congratulations, then pushed it into a beautifully engraved
silver cylinder, which was delivered with ceremony into the prince’s
hands and at once delivered by him without ceremony into the hands of an
officer. I will copy the address here. It is interesting, as showing
what an Indian prince’s subject may have opportunity to thank him for in
these days of modern English rule, as contrasted with what his ancestor
would have given them opportunity to thank him for a century and a half
ago–the days of freedom unhampered by English interference. A century
and a half ago an address of thanks could have been put into small
space. It would have thanked the prince–</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>For not slaughtering too many of his people upon mere
caprice;</p></li>
<li><p>For not stripping them bare by sudden and arbitrary tax levies,
and bringing famine upon them;</p></li>
<li><p>For not upon empty pretext destroying the rich and seizing their
property;</p></li>
<li><p>For not killing, blinding, imprisoning, or banishing the
relatives of the royal house to protect the throne from possible
plots;</p></li>
<li><p>For not betraying the subject secretly, for a bribe, into the
hands of bands of professional Thugs, to be murdered and robbed in the
prince’s back lot.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Those were rather common princely industries in the old times, but
they and some others of a harsh sort ceased long ago under English rule.
Better industries have taken their place, as this Address from the Jain
community will show:</p>
<p>“Your Highness,–We the undersigned members of the Jain community of
Bombay have the pleasure to approach your Highness with the expression
of our heartfelt congratulations on the recent conference on your
Highness of the Knighthood of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of
India. Ten years ago we had the pleasure and privilege of welcoming your
Highness to this city under circumstances which have made a memorable
epoch in the history of your State, for had it not been for a generous
and reasonable spirit that your Highness displayed in the negotiations
between the Palitana Durbar and the Jain community, the conciliatory
spirit that animated our people could not have borne fruit. That was the
first step in your Highness’s administration, and it fitly elicited the
praise of the Jain community, and of the Bombay Government. A decade of
your Highness’s administration, combined with the abilities, training,
and acquirements that your Highness brought to bear upon it, has justly
earned for your Highness the unique and honourable distinction–the
Knighthood of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India, which we
understand your Highness is the first to enjoy among Chiefs of your,
Highness’s rank and standing. And we assure your Highness that for this
mark of honour that has been conferred on you by Her Most Gracious
Majesty, the Queen-Empress, we feel no less proud than your Highness.
Establishment of commercial factories, schools, hospitals, etc., by your
Highness in your State has marked your Highness’s career during these
ten years, and we trust that your Highness will be spared to rule over
your people with wisdom and foresight, and foster the many reforms that
your Highness has been pleased to introduce in your State. We again
offer your Highness our warmest felicitations for the honour that has
been conferred on you. We beg to remain your Highness’s obedient
servants.“</p>
<p>Factories, schools, hospitals, reforms. The prince propagates that
kind of things in the modern times, and gets knighthood and guns for
it.</p>
<p>After the address the prince responded with snap and brevity; spoke a
moment with half a dozen guests in English, and with an official or two
in a native tongue; then the garlands were distributed as usual, and the
function ended.</p>
