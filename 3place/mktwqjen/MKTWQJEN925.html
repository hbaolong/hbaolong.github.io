1886-87. JANE CLEMENS’S ROMANCE. UNMAILED LETTERS, ETC.</h4>
<p>When Clemens had been platforming with Cable and returned to Hartford
for his Christmas vacation, the Warner and Clemens families had joined
in preparing for him a surprise performance of The Prince and the
Pauper. The Clemens household was always given to theatricals, and it
was about this time that scenery and a stage were prepared–mainly by the
sculptor Gerhardt–for these home performances, after which productions
of The Prince and the Pauper were given with considerable regularity to
audiences consisting of parents and invited friends. The subject is a
fascinating one, but it has been dwelt upon elsewhere.–[In Mark Twain: A
Biography, chaps. cliii and clx.]–We get a glimpse of one of these
occasions as well as of Mark Twain’s financial progress in the next
brief note.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells; in Boston:</p>
<p>Jan. 3, ’86. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–The date set for the Prince and Pauper
play is ten days hence–Jan. 13. I hope you and Pilla can take a train
that arrives here during the day; the one that leaves Boston toward the
end of the afternoon would be a trifle late; the performance would have
already begun when you reached the house.</p>
<p>I’m out of the woods. On the last day of the year I had paid out
82,000 on the Grant book and it was totally free from debt. Yrs ever
MARK.</p>
<p>Mark Twain’s mother was a woman of sturdy character and with a keen
sense of humor and tender sympathies. Her husband, John Marshall
Clemens, had been a man of high moral character, honored by all who knew
him, respected and apparently loved by his wife. No one would ever have
supposed that during all her years of marriage, and almost to her death,
she carried a secret romance that would only be told at last in the
weary disappointment of old age. It is a curious story, and it came to
light in this curious way:</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, May 19, ’86. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–….. Here’s a secret. A most
curious and pathetic romance, which has just come to light. Read these
things, but don’t mention them. Last fall, my old mother–then 82–took a
notion to attend a convention of old settlers of the Mississippi Valley
in an Iowa town. My brother’s wife was astonished; and represented to
her the hardships and fatigues of such a trip, and said my mother might
possibly not even survive them; and said there could be no possible
interest for her in such a meeting and such a crowd. But my mother
insisted, and persisted; and finally gained her point. They started; and
all the way my mother was young again with excitement, interest,
eagerness, anticipation. They reached the town and the hotel. My mother
strode with the same eagerness in her eye and her step, to the counter,
and said:</p>
<p>“Is Dr. Barrett of St. Louis, here?“</p>
<p>“No. He was here, but he returned to St. Louis this morning.“</p>
<p>“Will he come again?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>My mother turned away, the fire all gone from her, and said, “Let us
go home.“</p>
<p>They went straight back to Keokuk. My mother sat silent and thinking
for many days–a thing which had never happened before. Then one day she
said:</p>
<p>“I will tell you a secret. When I was eighteen, a young medical
student named Barrett lived in Columbia (Ky.) eighteen miles away; and
he used to ride over to see me. This continued for some time. I loved
him with my whole heart, and I knew that he felt the same toward me,
though no words had been spoken. He was too bashful to speak–he could
not do it. Everybody supposed we were engaged–took it for granted we
were–but we were not. By and by there was to be a party in a neighboring
town, and he wrote my uncle telling him his feelings, and asking him to
drive me over in his buggy and let him (Barrett) drive me back, so that
he might have that opportunity to propose. My uncle should have done as
he was asked, without explaining anything to me; but instead, he read me
the letter; and then, of course, I could not go–and did not. He
(Barrett) left the country presently, and I, to stop the clacking
tongues, and to show him that I did not care, married, in a pet. In all
these sixty-four years I have not seen him since. I saw in a paper that
he was going to attend that Old Settlers’ Convention. Only three hours
before we reached that hotel, he had been standing there!“</p>
<p>Since then, her memory is wholly faded out and gone; and now she
writes letters to the school-mates who had been dead forty years, and
wonders why they neglect her and do not answer.</p>
<p>Think of her carrying that pathetic burden in her old heart
sixty-four years, and no human being ever suspecting it! Yrs ever,
MARK.</p>
<p>We do not get the idea from this letter that those two long ago
sweethearts quarreled, but Mark Twain once spoke of their having done
so, and there may have been a disagreement, assuming that there was a
subsequent meeting. It does not matter, now. In speaking of it, Mark
Twain once said: “It is as pathetic a romance as any that has crossed
the field of my personal experience in a long lifetime.“–[When Mark
Twain: A Biography was written this letter had not come to light, and
the matter was stated there in accordance with Mark Twain’s latest
memory of it.]</p>
<p>Howells wrote: “After all, how poor and hackneyed all the inventions
are compared with the simple and stately facts. Who could have imagined
such a heart-break as that? Yet it went along with the fulfillment of
everyday duty and made no more noise than a grave under foot. I doubt if
fiction will ever get the knack of such things.“</p>
<p>Jane Clemens now lived with her son Orion and his wife, in Keokuk,
where she was more contented than elsewhere. In these later days her
memory had become erratic, her realization of events about her
uncertain, but there were times when she was quite her former self,
remembering clearly and talking with her old-time gaiety of spirit. Mark
Twain frequently sent her playful letters to amuse her, letters full of
such boyish gaiety as had amused her long years before. The one that
follows is a fair example. It was written after a visit which Clemens
and his family had paid to Keokuk.</p>
<p>To Jane Clemens, in Keokuk:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Aug. 7, ’86. DEAR MA,–I heard that Molly and Orion and Pamela
had been sick, but I see by your letter that they are much better now,
or nearly well. When we visited you a month ago, it seemed to us that
your Keokuk weather was pretty hot; Jean and Clara sat up in bed at
Mrs. McElroy’s and cried about it, and so did I; but I judge by your
letter that it has cooled down, now, so that a person is comparatively
comfortable, with his skin off. Well it did need cooling; I remember
that I burnt a hole in my shirt, there, with some ice cream that fell on
it; and Miss Jenkins told me they never used a stove, but cooked their
meals on a marble-topped table in the drawing-room, just with the
natural heat. If anybody else had told me, I would not have believed it.
I was told by the Bishop of Keokuk that he did not allow crying at
funerals, because it scalded the furniture. If Miss Jenkins had told me
that, I would have believed it. This reminds me that you speak of
Dr. Jenkins and his family as if they were strangers to me. Indeed they
are not. Don’t you suppose I remember gratefully how tender the doctor
was with Jean when she hurt her arm, and how quickly he got the pain out
of the hurt, whereas I supposed it was going to last at least an hour?
No, I don’t forget some things as easily as I do others.</p>
<p>Yes, it was pretty hot weather. Now here, when a person is going to
die, he is always in a sweat about where he is going to; but in Keokuk
of course they don’t care, because they are fixed for everything. It has
set me reflecting, it has taught me a lesson. By and by, when my health
fails, I am going to put all my affairs in order, and bid good-bye to my
friends here, and kill all the people I don’t like, and go out to Keokuk
and prepare for death.</p>
<p>They are all well in this family, and we all send love. Affly Your
Son SAM.</p>
<p>The ways of city officials and corporations are often past
understanding, and Mark Twain sometimes found it necessary to write
picturesque letters of protest. The following to a Hartford lighting
company is a fair example of these documents.</p>
<p>To a gas and electric-lighting company, in Hartford:</p>
<p>GENTLEMEN,–There are but two places in our whole street where lights
could be of any value, by any accident, and you have measured and
appointed your intervals so ingeniously as to leave each of those places
in the centre of a couple of hundred yards of solid darkness. When I
noticed that you were setting one of your lights in such a way that I
could almost see how to get into my gate at night, I suspected that it
was a piece of carelessness on the part of the workmen, and would be
corrected as soon as you should go around inspecting and find it out. My
judgment was right; it is always right, when you axe concerned. For
fifteen years, in spite of my prayers and tears, you persistently kept a
gas lamp exactly half way between my gates, so that I couldn’t find
either of them after dark; and then furnished such execrable gas that I
had to hang a danger signal on the lamp post to keep teams from running
into it, nights. Now I suppose your present idea is, to leave us a
little more in the dark.</p>
<p>Don’t mind us–out our way; we possess but one vote apiece, and no
rights which you are in any way bound to respect. Please take your
electric light and go to–but never mind, it is not for me to suggest;
you will probably find the way; and any way you can reasonably count on
divine assistance if you lose your bearings.</p>
<p>S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Frequently Clemens did not send letters of this sort after they were
written. Sometimes he realized the uselessness of such protest,
sometimes the mere writing of them had furnished the necessary relief,
and he put, the letter away, or into the wastebasket, and wrote
something more temperate, or nothing at all. A few such letters here
follow.</p>
<p>Clemens was all the time receiving application from people who wished
him to recommend one article or another; books, plays, tobacco, and what
not. They were generally persistent people, unable to accept a polite or
kindly denial. Once he set down some remarks on this particular phase of
correspondence. He wrote:</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>No doubt Mr. Edison has been offered a large interest in many and
many an electrical project, for the use of his name to float it withal.
And no doubt all men who have achieved for their names, in any line of
activity whatever, a sure market value, have been familiar with this
sort of solicitation. Reputation is a hall-mark: it can remove doubt
from pure silver, and it can also make the plated article pass for
pure.</p>
<p>And so, people without a hall-mark of their own are always trying to
get the loan of somebody else’s.</p>
<p>As a rule, that kind of a person sees only one side of the case. He
sees that his invention or his painting or his book is–apparently–a
trifle better than you yourself can do, therefore why shouldn’t you be
willing to put your hall-mark on it? You will be giving the purchaser
his full money’s worth; so who is hurt, and where is the harm? Besides,
are you not helping a struggling fellow-craftsman, and is it not your
duty to do that?</p>
<p>That side is plenty clear enough to him, but he can’t and won’t see
the other side, to-wit: that you are a rascal if you put your hall-mark
upon a thing which you did not produce yourself, howsoever good it may
be. How simple that is; and yet there are not two applicants in a
hundred who can, be made to see it.</p>
<p>When one receives an application of this sort, his first emotion is
an indignant sense of insult; his first deed is the penning of a sharp
answer. He blames nobody but that other person. That person is a very
base being; he must be; he would degrade himself for money, otherwise it
would not occur to him that you would do such a thing. But all the same,
that application has done its work, and taken you down in your own
estimation. You recognize that everybody hasn’t as high an opinion of
you as you have of yourself; and in spite of you there ensues an
interval during which you are not, in your own estimation as fine a bird
as you were before.</p>
<p>However, being old and experienced, you do not mail your sharp
letter, but leave it lying a day. That saves you. For by that time you
have begun to reflect that you are a person who deals in
exaggerations–and exaggerations are lies. You meant yours to be playful,
and thought you made them unmistakably so. But you couldn’t make them
playfulnesses to a man who has no sense of the playful and can see
nothing but the serious side of things. You rattle on quite playfully,
and with measureless extravagance, about how you wept at the tomb of
Adam; and all in good time you find to your astonishment that no end of
people took you at your word and believed you. And presently they find
out that you were not in earnest. They have been deceived; therefore,
(as they argue–and there is a sort of argument in it,) you are a
deceiver. If you will deceive in one way, why shouldn’t you in another?
So they apply for the use of your trade-mark. You are amazed and
affronted. You retort that you are not that kind of person. Then they
are amazed and affronted; and wonder “since when?“</p>
<p>By this time you have got your bearings. You realize that perhaps
there is a little blame on both sides. You are in the right frame, now.
So you write a letter void of offense, declining. You mail this one; you
pigeon-hole the other.</p>
<p>That is, being old and experienced, you do, but early in your career,
you don’t: you mail the first one.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>An enthusiast who had a new system of musical notation, wrote to me
and suggested that a magazine article from me, contrasting the
absurdities of the old system with the simplicities of his new one,
would be sure to make a “rousing hit.“ He shouted and shouted over the
marvels wrought by his system, and quoted the handsome compliments which
had been paid it by famous musical people; but he forgot to tell me what
his notation was like, or what its simplicities consisted in. So I could
not have written the article if I had wanted to–which I didn’t; because
I hate strangers with axes to grind. I wrote him a courteous note
explaining how busy I was–I always explain how busy I am–and casually
drooped this remark:</p>
<p>“I judge the X-X notation to be a rational mode of representing
music, in place of the prevailing fashion, which was the invention of an
idiot.“</p>
<p>Next mail he asked permission to print that meaningless remark. I
answered, no–courteously, but still, no; explaining that I could not
afford to be placed in the attitude of trying to influence people with a
mere worthless guess. What a scorcher I got, next mail! Such irony! such
sarcasm, such caustic praise of my superhonorable loyalty to the public!
And withal, such compassion for my stupidity, too, in not being able to
understand my own language. I cannot remember the words of this letter
broadside, but there was about a page used up in turning this idea round
and round and exposing it in different lights.</p>
<p>Unmailed Answer:</p>
<p>DEAR SIR,–What is the trouble with you? If it is your viscera, you
cannot have them taken out and reorganized a moment too soon. I mean, if
they are inside. But if you are composed of them, that is another
matter. Is it your brain? But it could not be your brain. Possibly it is
your skull: you want to look out for that. Some people, when they get an
idea, it pries the structure apart. Your system of notation has got in
there, and couldn’t find room, without a doubt that is what the trouble
is. Your skull was not made to put ideas in, it was made to throw
potatoes at. Yours Truly.</p>
<p>Mailed Answer:</p>
<p>DEAR SIR,–Come, come–take a walk; you disturb the children. Yours
Truly.</p>
<p>There was a day, now happily nearly over, when certain newspapers
made a practice of inviting men distinguished in any walk of life to
give their time and effort without charge to express themselves on some
subject of the day, or perhaps they were asked to send their favorite
passages in prose or verse, with the reasons why. Such symposiums were
“features“ that cost the newspapers only the writing of a number of
letters, stationery, and postage. To one such invitation Mark Twain
wrote two replies. They follow herewith:</p>
<p>Unmailed Answer:</p>
<p>DEAR SIR,–I have received your proposition–which you have imitated
from a pauper London periodical which had previously imitated the idea
of this sort of mendicancy from seventh-rate American journalism, where
it originated as a variation of the inexpensive “interview.“</p>
<p>Why do you buy Associated Press dispatches? To make your paper the
more salable, you answer. But why don’t you try to beg them? Why do you
discriminate? I can sell my stuff; why should I give it to you? Why
don’t you ask me for a shirt? What is the difference between asking me
for the worth of a shirt and asking me for the shirt itself? Perhaps you
didn’t know you were begging. I would not use that argument–it makes the
user a fool. The passage of poetry–or prose, if you will–which has taken
deepest root in my thought, and which I oftenest return to and dwell
upon with keenest no matter what, is this: That the proper place for
journalists who solicit literary charity is on the street corner with
their hats in their hands.</p>
<p>Mailed Answer:</p>
<p>DEAR SIR,–Your favor of recent date is received, but I am obliged by
press of work to decline.</p>
<p>The manager of a traveling theatrical company wrote that he had taken
the liberty of dramatizing Tom Sawyer, and would like also the use of
the author’s name–the idea being to convey to the public that it was a
Mark Twain play. In return for this slight favor the manager sent an
invitation for Mark Twain to come and see the play –to be present on the
opening night, as it were, at his (the manager’s) expense. He added that
if the play should be a go in the cities there might be some
“arrangement“ of profits. Apparently these inducements did not appeal to
Mark Twain. The long unmailed reply is the more interesting, but
probably the briefer one that follows it was quite as effective.</p>
<p>Unmailed Answer:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Sept. 8, ’87. DEAR SIR,–And so it has got around to you, at
last; and you also have “taken the liberty.“ You are No. 1365. When 1364
sweeter and better people, including the author, have “tried“ to
dramatize Tom Sawyer and did not arrive, what sort of show do you
suppose you stand? That is a book, dear sir, which cannot be dramatized.
One might as well try to dramatize any other hymn. Tom Sawyer is simply
a hymn, put into prose form to give it a worldly air.</p>
<p>Why the pale doubt that flitteth dim and nebulous athwart the
forecastle of your third sentence? Have no fears. Your piece will be a
Go. It will go out the back door on the first night. They’ve all done it
–the 1364. So will 1365. Not one of us ever thought of the simple device
of half-soling himself with a stove-lid. Ah, what suffering a little
hindsight would have saved us. Treasure this hint.</p>
<p>How kind of you to invite me to the funeral. Go to; I have attended a
thousand of them. I have seen Tom Sawyer’s remains in all the different
kinds of dramatic shrouds there are. You cannot start anything fresh.
Are you serious when you propose to pay my expence–if that is the
Susquehannian way of spelling it? And can you be aware that I charge a
hundred dollars a mile when I travel for pleasure? Do you realize that
it is 432 miles to Susquehanna? Would it be handy for you to send me the
3,200 first, so I could be counting it as I come along; because
railroading is pretty dreary to a sensitive nature when there’s nothing
sordid to buck at for Zeitvertreib.</p>
<p>Now as I understand it, dear and magnanimous 1365, you are going to
recreate Tom Sawyer dramatically, and then do me the compliment to put
me in the bills as father of this shady offspring. Sir, do you know that
this kind of a compliment has destroyed people before now? Listen.</p>
<p>Twenty-four years ago, I was strangely handsome. The remains of it
are still visible through the rifts of time. I was so handsome that
human activities ceased as if spellbound when I came in view, and even
inanimate things stopped to look–like locomotives, and district
messenger boys and so-on. In San Francisco, in the rainy season I was
often mistaken for fair weather. Upon one occasion I was traveling in
the Sonora region, and stopped for an hour’s nooning, to rest my horse
and myself. All the town came out to look. The tribes of Indians
gathered to look. A Piute squaw named her baby for me,–a voluntary
compliment which pleased me greatly. Other attentions were paid me. Last
of all arrived the president and faculty of Sonora University and
offered me the post of Professor of Moral Culture and the Dogmatic
Humanities; which I accepted gratefully, and entered at once upon my
duties. But my name had pleased the Indians, and in the deadly kindness
of their hearts they went on naming their babies after me. I tried to
stop it, but the Indians could not understand why I should object to so
manifest a compliment. The thing grew and grew and spread and spread and
became exceedingly embarrassing. The University stood it a couple of
years; but then for the sake of the college they felt obliged to call a
halt, although I had the sympathy of the whole faculty. The president
himself said to me, “I am as sorry as I can be for you, and would still
hold out if there were any hope ahead; but you see how it is: there are
a hundred and thirty-two of them already, and fourteen precincts to hear
from. The circumstance has brought your name into most wide and
unfortunate renown. It causes much comment–I believe that that is not an
over-statement. Some of this comment is palliative, but some of it –by
patrons at a distance, who only know the statistics without the
explanation,–is offensive, and in some cases even violent. Nine students
have been called home. The trustees of the college have been growing
more and more uneasy all these last months–steadily along with the
implacable increase in your census–and I will not conceal from you that
more than once they have touched upon the expediency of a change in the
Professorship of Moral Culture. The coarsely sarcastic editorial in
yesterday’s Alta, headed Give the Moral Acrobat a Rest–has brought
things to a crisis, and I am charged with the unpleasant duty of
receiving your resignation.“</p>
<p>I know you only mean me a kindness, dear 1365, but it is a most
deadly mistake. Please do not name your Injun for me. Truly Yours.</p>
<p>Mailed Answer:</p>
<p>NEW YORK, Sept. 8. 1887. DEAR SIR,–Necessarily I cannot assent to so
strange a proposition. And I think it but fair to warn you that if you
put the piece on the stage, you must take the legal consequences. Yours
respectfully, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Before the days of international copyright no American author’s books
were pirated more freely by Canadian publishers than those of Mark
Twain. It was always a sore point with him that these books, cheaply
printed, found their way into the United States, and were sold in
competition with his better editions. The law on the subject seemed to
be rather hazy, and its various interpretations exasperating. In the
next unmailed letter Mark Twain relieves himself to a misguided
official. The letter is worth reading today, if for no other reason, to
show the absurdity of copyright conditions which prevailed at that
time.</p>
<p>Unmailed Letter to H. C. Christiancy, on book Piracy:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Dec. 18, ’87. H. C. CHRISTIANCY, ESQ.</p>
<p>DEAR SIR,–As I understand it, the position of the U. S. Government is
this: If a person be captured on the border with counterfeit bonds in
his hands–bonds of the N. Y. Central Railway, for instance–the procedure
in his case shall be as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If the N. Y. C. have not previously filed in the several police
offices along the border, proof of ownership of the originals of the
bonds, the government officials must collect a duty on the counterfeits,
and then let them go ahead and circulate in this country.</p></li>
<li><p>But if there is proof already on file, then the N. Y. C. may pay
the duty and take the counterfeits.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But in no case will the United States consent to go without its share
of the swag. It is delicious. The biggest and proudest government on
earth turned sneak-thief; collecting pennies on stolen property, and
pocketing them with a greasy and libidinous leer; going into partnership
with foreign thieves to rob its own children; and when the child escapes
the foreigner, descending to the abysmal baseness of hanging on and
robbing the infant all alone by itself! Dear sir, this is not any more
respectable than for a father to collect toll on the forced prostitution
of his own daughter; in fact it is the same thing. Upon these terms,
what is a U. S. custom house but a “fence?“ That is all it is: a
legalized trader in stolen goods.</p>
<p>And this nasty law, this filthy law, this unspeakable law calls
itself a “regulation for the protection of owners of copyright!“ Can
sarcasm go further than that? In what way does it protect them?
Inspiration itself could not furnish a rational answer to that question.
Whom does it protect, then? Nobody, as far as I can see, but the foreign
thief –sometimes–and his fellow-footpad the U. S. government, all the
time. What could the Central Company do with the counterfeit bonds after
it had bought them of the star spangled banner Master-thief? Sell them
at a dollar apiece and fetch down the market for the genuine
hundred-dollar bond? What could I do with that 20-cent copy of “Roughing
It“ which the United States has collared on the border and is waiting to
release to me for cash in case I am willing to come down to its moral
level and help rob myself? Sell it at ten or fifteen cents–duty
added–and destroy the market for the original ,50 book? Who ever did
invent that law? I would like to know the name of that immortal
jackass.</p>
<p>Dear sir, I appreciate your courtesy in stretching your authority in
the desire to do me a kindness, and I sincerely thank you for it. But I
have no use for that book; and if I were even starving for it I would
not pay duty on in either to get it or suppress it. No doubt there are
ways in which I might consent to go into partnership with thieves and
fences, but this is not one of them. This one revolts the remains of my
self-respect; turns my stomach. I think I could companion with a
highwayman who carried a shot-gun and took many risks; yes, I think I
should like that if I were younger; but to go in with a big rich
government that robs paupers, and the widows and orphans of paupers and
takes no risk–why the thought just gags me.</p>
<p>Oh, no, I shall never pay any duties on pirated books of mine. I am
much too respectable for that–yet awhile. But here–one thing that
grovels me is this: as far as I can discover–while freely granting that
the U. S. copyright laws are far and away the most idiotic that exist
anywhere on the face of the earth–they don’t authorize the government to
admit pirated books into this country, toll or no toll. And so I think
that that regulation is the invention of one of those people–as a rule,
early stricken of God, intellectually–the departmental interpreters of
the laws, in Washington. They can always be depended on to take any
reasonably good law and interpret the common sense all out of it. They
can be depended on, every time, to defeat a good law, and make it
inoperative–yes, and utterly grotesque, too, mere matter for laughter
and derision. Take some of the decisions of the Post-office Department,
for instance–though I do not mean to suggest that that asylum is any
worse than the others for the breeding and nourishing of incredible
lunatics–I merely instance it because it happens to be the first to come
into my mind. Take that case of a few years ago where the P. M. General
suddenly issued an edict requiring you to add the name of the State
after Boston, New York, Chicago, andandandandc, in your superscriptions,
on pain of having your letter stopped and forwarded to the dead-letter
office; yes, and I believe he required the county, too. He made one
little concession in favor of New York: you could say “New York City,“
and stop there; but if you left off the “city,“ you must add “N. Y.“ to
your “New York.“ Why, it threw the business of the whole country into
chaos and brought commerce almost to a stand-still. Now think of that!
When that man goes to–to–well, wherever he is going to–we shan’t want
the microscopic details of his address. I guess we can find him.</p>
<p>Well, as I was saying, I believe that this whole paltry and
ridiculous swindle is a pure creation of one of those cabbages that used
to be at the head of one of those Retreats down there–Departments, you
know–and that you will find it so, if you will look into it. And
moreover–but land, I reckon we are both tired by this time. Truly Yours,
MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>XXVII</p>
<p>MISCELLANEOUS LETTERS OF 1887. LITERARY ARTICLES. PEACEFUL DAYS AT
THE FARM. FAVORITE READING. APOLOGY TO MRS. CLEVELAND, ETC.</p>
<p>We have seen in the preceding chapter how unknown aspirants in one
field or another were always seeking to benefit by Mark Twain’s
reputation. Once he remarked, “The symbol of the human race ought to be
an ax; every human being has one concealed about him somewhere.“ He
declared when a stranger called on him, or wrote to him, in nine cases
out of ten he could distinguish the gleam of the ax almost immediately.
The following letter is closely related to those of the foregoing
chapter, only that this one was mailed–not once, but many times, in some
form adapted to the specific applicant. It does not matter to whom it
was originally written, the name would not be recognized.</p>
<p>To Mrs. T. Concerning unearned credentials, etc.</p>
<p>HARTFORD, 1887. MY DEAR MADAM,–It is an idea which many people have
had, but it is of no value. I have seen it tried out many and many a
time. I have seen a lady lecturer urged and urged upon the public in a
lavishly complimentary document signed by Longfellow, Whittier, Holmes
and some others of supreme celebrity, but–there was nothing in her and
she failed. If there had been any great merit in her she never would
have needed those men’s help and (at her rather mature age,) would never
have consented to ask for it.</p>
<p>There is an unwritten law about human successes, and your sister must
bow to that law, she must submit to its requirements. In brief this law
is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>No occupation without an apprenticeship.</p></li>
<li><p>No pay to the apprentice.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This law stands right in the way of the subaltern who wants to be a
General before he has smelt powder; and it stands (and should stand) in
everybody’s way who applies for pay or position before he has served his
apprenticeship and proved himself. Your sister’s course is perfectly
plain. Let her enclose this letter to Maj. J. B. Pond, and offer to
lecture a year for 0 a week and her expenses, the contract to be
annullable by him at any time, after a month’s notice, but not
annullable by her at all. The second year, he to have her services, if
he wants them, at a trifle under the best price offered her by anybody
else.</p>
<p>She can learn her trade in those two years, and then be entitled to
remuneration–but she can not learn it in any less time than that, unless
she is a human miracle.</p>
<p>Try it, and do not be afraid. It is the fair and right thing. If she
wins, she will win squarely and righteously, and never have to blush.
Truly yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Howells wrote, in February, offering to get a publisher to take the
Library of Humor off Mark Twain’s hands. Howells had been paid
twenty-six hundred dollars for the work on it, and his conscience hurt
him when he reflected that the book might never be used. In this letter
he also refers to one of the disastrous inventions in which Clemens had
invested–a method of casting brass dies for stamping book-covers and
wall-paper. Howells’s purpose was to introduce something of the matter
into his next story. Mark Twain’s reply gives us a light on this
particular invention.</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Feb. 15, ’87. DEAR HOWELLS,–I was in New York five days
ago, and Webster mentioned the Library, and proposed to publish it a
year or a year and half hence. I have written him your proposition
to-day. (The Library is part of the property of the C. L. W.
andandandand Co. firm.)</p>
<p>I don’t remember what that technical phrase was, but I think you will
find it in any Cyclopedia under the head of “Brass.“ The thing I best
remember is, that the self-styled “inventor“ had a very ingenious way of
keeping me from seeing him apply his invention: the first appointment
was spoiled by his burning down the man’s shop in which it was to be
done, the night before; the second was spoiled by his burning down his
own shop the night before. He unquestionably did both of these things.
He really had no invention; the whole project was a blackmailing
swindle, and cost me several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The slip you sent me from the May “Study“ has delighted Mrs. Clemens
and me to the marrow. To think that thing might be possible to many; but
to be brave enough to say it is possible to you only, I certainly
believe. The longer I live the clearer I perceive how unmatchable, how
unapproachable, a compliment one pays when he says of a man “he has the
courage (to utter) his convictions.“ Haven’t you had reviewers talk Alps
to you, and then print potato hills?</p>
<p>I haven’t as good an opinion of my work as you hold of it, but I’ve
always done what I could to secure and enlarge my good opinion of it.
I’ve always said to myself, “Everybody reads it and that’s something–it
surely isn’t pernicious, or the most acceptable people would get pretty
tired of it.“ And when a critic said by implication that it wasn’t high
and fine, through the remark “High and fine literature is wine“ I
retorted (confidentially, to myself,) “yes, high and fine literature is
wine, and mine is only water; but everybody likes water.“</p>
<p>You didn’t tell me to return that proof-slip, so I have pasted it
into my private scrap-book. None will see it there. With a thousand
thanks. Ys Ever MARK.</p>
<p>Our next letter is an unmailed answer, but it does not belong with
the others, having been withheld for reasons of quite a different sort.
Jeanette Gilder, then of the Critic, was one of Mark Twain’s valued
friends. In the comment which he made, when it was shown to him
twenty-two years later, he tells us why he thinks this letter was not
sent. The name, “Rest-and-be-Thankful,“ was the official title given to
the summer place at Elmira, but it was more often known as “Quarry
Farm.“</p>
<p>To Jeannette Gilder (not mailed):</p>
<p>HARTFORD, May 14, ’87. MY DEAR MISS GILDER,–We shall spend the summer
at the same old place-the remote farm called “Rest-and-be-Thankful,“ on
top of the hills three miles from Elmira, N. Y. Your other question is
harder to answer. It is my habit to keep four or five books in process
of erection all the time, and every summer add a few courses of bricks
to two or three of them; but I cannot forecast which of the two or three
it is going to be. It takes seven years to complete a book by this
method, but still it is a good method: gives the public a rest. I have
been accused of “rushing into print“ prematurely, moved thereto by
greediness for money; but in truth I have never done that. Do you care
for trifles of information? (Well, then, “Tom Sawyer“ and “The Prince
and the Pauper“ were each on the stocks two or three years, and “Old
Times on the Mississippi“ eight.) One of my unfinished books has been on
the stocks sixteen years; another seventeen. This latter book could have
been finished in a day, at any time during the past five years. But as
in the first of these two narratives all the action takes place in
Noah’s ark, and as in the other the action takes place in heaven, there
seemed to be no hurry, and so I have not hurried. Tales of stirring
adventure in those localities do not need to be rushed to publication
lest they get stale by waiting. In twenty-one years, with all my time at
my free disposal I have written and completed only eleven books, whereas
with half the labor that a journalist does I could have written sixty in
that time. I do not greatly mind being accused of a proclivity for
rushing into print, but at the same time I don’t believe that the charge
is really well founded. Suppose I did write eleven books, have you
nothing to be grateful for? Go to—remember the forty-nine which I didn’t
write. Truly Yours S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Notes (added twenty-two years later):</p>
<p>Stormfield, April 30, 1909. It seems the letter was not sent. I
probably feared she might print it, and I couldn’t find a way to say so
without running a risk of hurting her. No one would hurt Jeannette
Gilder purposely, and no one would want to run the risk of doing it
unintentionally. She is my neighbor, six miles away, now, and I must ask
her about this ancient letter.</p>
<p>I note with pride and pleasure that I told no untruths in my unsent
answer. I still have the habit of keeping unfinished books lying around
years and years, waiting. I have four or five novels on hand at present
in a half-finished condition, and it is more than three years since I
have looked at any of them. I have no intention of finishing them. I
could complete all of them in less than a year, if the impulse should
come powerfully upon me: Long, long ago money-necessity furnished that
impulse once, (“Following the Equator“), but mere desire for money has
never furnished it, so far as I remember. Not even money-necessity was
able to overcome me on a couple of occasions when perhaps I ought to
have allowed it to succeed. While I was a bankrupt and in debt two
offers were made me for weekly literary contributions to continue during
a year, and they would have made a debtless man of me, but I declined
them, with my wife’s full approval, for I had known of no instance where
a man had pumped himself out once a week and failed to run “emptyings“
before the year was finished.</p>
<p>As to that “Noah’s Ark“ book, I began it in Edinburgh in 1873;–[This
is not quite correct. The “Noah’s Ark“ book was begun in Buffalo in
1870.] I don’t know where the manuscript is now. It was a Diary, which
professed to be the work of Shem, but wasn’t. I began it again several
months ago, but only for recreation; I hadn’t any intention of carrying
it to a finish –or even to the end of the first chapter, in fact.</p>
<p>As to the book whose action “takes place in Heaven.“ That was a small
thing, (“Captain Stormfield’s Visit to Heaven.“) It lay in my
pigeon-holes 40 years, then I took it out and printed it in Harper’s
Monthly last year. S. L. C.</p>
<p>In the next letter we get a pretty and peaceful picture of
“Rest-and-be-Thankful.“ These were Mark Twain’s balmy days. The
financial drain of the type-machine was heavy but not yet exhausting,
and the prospect of vast returns from it seemed to grow brighter each
day. His publishing business, though less profitable, was still
prosperous, his family life was ideal. How gratefully, then, he could
enter into the peace of that “perfect day.“</p>
<p>To Mrs. Orion Clemens, in Keokuk, Ia.:</p>
<p>ON THE HILL NEAR ELMIRA, July 10, ’87. DEAR MOLLIE,–This is a superb
Sunday for weather–very cloudy, and the thermometer as low as 65. The
city in the valley is purple with shade, as seen from up here at the
study. The Cranes are reading and loafing in the canvas-curtained
summer-house 50 yards away on a higher (the highest) point; the cats are
loafing over at “Ellerslie“ which is the children’s estate and
dwellinghouse in their own private grounds (by deed from Susie Crane) a
hundred yards from the study, amongst the clover and young oaks and
willows. Livy is down at the house, but I shall now go and bring her up
to the Cranes to help us occupy the lounges and hammocks–whence a great
panorama of distant hill and valley and city is seeable. The children
have gone on a lark through the neighboring hills and woods. It is a
perfect day indeed. With love to you all. SAM.</p>
<p>Two days after this letter was written we get a hint of what was the
beginning of business trouble–that is to say, of the failing health of
Charles L. Webster. Webster was ambitious, nervous, and not robust. He
had overworked and was paying the penalty. His trouble was neurasthenia,
and he was presently obliged to retire altogether from the business. The
“Sam and Mary“ mentioned were Samuel Moffet and his wife.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Pamela Moffett, in Fredonia, N. Y.</p>
<p>ELMIRA, July 12, ’87 MY DEAR SISTER,–I had no idea that Charley’s
case was so serious. I knew it was bad, and persistent, but I was not
aware of the full size of the matter.</p>
<p>I have just been writing to a friend in Hartford’ who treated what I
imagine was a similar case surgically last fall, and produced a
permanent cure. If this is a like case, Charley must go to him.</p>
<p>If relief fails there, he must take the required rest, whether the
business can stand it or not.</p>
<p>It is most pleasant to hear such prosperous accounts of Sam and Mary,
I do not see how Sam could well be more advantageously fixed. He can
grow up with that paper, and achieve a successful life.</p>
<p>It is not all holiday here with Susie and Clara this time. They have
to put in some little time every day on their studies. Jean thinks she
is studying too, but I don’t know what it is unless it is the horses;
she spends the day under their heels in the stables–and that is but a
continuation of her Hartford system of culture.</p>
<p>With love from us all to you all. Affectionately SAM.</p>
<p>Mark Twain had a few books that he read regularly every year or two.
Among these were ‘Pepys’s Diary’, Suetonius’s ‘Lives of the Twelve
Caesars’, and Thomas Carlyle’s ‘French Revolution’. He had a passion for
history, biography, and personal memoirs of any sort. In his early life
he had cared very little for poetry, but along in the middle eighties he
somehow acquired a taste for Browning and became absorbed in it. A
Browning club assembled as often as once a week at the Clemens home in
Hartford to listen to his readings of the master. He was an impressive
reader, and he carefully prepared himself for these occasions,
indicating by graduated underscorings, the exact values he wished to
give to words and phrases. Those were memorable gatherings, and they
must have continued through at least two winters. It is one of the
puzzling phases of Mark Twain’s character that, notwithstanding his
passion for direct and lucid expression, he should have found pleasure
in the poems of Robert Browning.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Aug. 22, ’87. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–How stunning are the changes
which age makes in a man while he sleeps. When I finished Carlyle’s
French Revolution in 1871, I was a Girondin; every time I have read it
since, I have read it differently being influenced and changed, little
by little, by life and environment (and Taine and St. Simon): and now I
lay the book down once more, and recognize that I am a Sansculotte!–And
not a pale, characterless Sansculotte, but a Marat. Carlyle teaches no
such gospel so the change is in me–in my vision of the evidences.</p>
<p>People pretend that the Bible means the same to them at 50 that it
did at all former milestones in their journey. I wonder how they can lie
so. It comes of practice, no doubt. They would not say that of Dickens’s
or Scott’s books. Nothing remains the same. When a man goes back to look
at the house of his childhood, it has always shrunk: there is no
instance of such a house being as big as the picture in memory and
imagination call for. Shrunk how? Why, to its correct dimensions: the
house hasn’t altered; this is the first time it has been in focus.</p>
<p>Well, that’s loss. To have house and Bible shrink so, under the
disillusioning corrected angle, is loss-for a moment. But there are
compensations. You tilt the tube skyward and bring planets and comets
and corona flames a hundred and fifty thousand miles high into the
field. Which I see you have done, and found Tolstoi. I haven’t got him
in focus yet, but I’ve got Browning . . . . Ys Ever MARK.</p>
<p>Mention has been made already of Mark Twain’s tendency to
absentmindedness. He was always forgetting engagements, or getting them
wrong. Once he hurried to an afternoon party, and finding the mistress
of the house alone, sat down and talked to her comfortably for an hour
or two, not remembering his errand at all. It was only when he reached
home that he learned that the party had taken place the week before. It
was always dangerous for him to make engagements, and he never seemed to
profit by sorrowful experience. We, however, may profit now by one of
his amusing apologies.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Grover Cleveland, in Washington:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Nov. 6, 1887. MY DEAR MADAM,–I do not know how it is in the
White House, but in this house of ours whenever the minor half of the
administration tries to run itself without the help of the major half it
gets aground. Last night when I was offered the opportunity to assist
you in the throwing open the Warner brothers superb benefaction in
Bridgeport to those fortunate women, I naturally appreciated the honor
done me, and promptly seized my chance. I had an engagement, but the
circumstances washed it out of my mind. If I had only laid the matter
before the major half of the administration on the spot, there would
have been no blunder; but I never thought of that. So when I did lay it
before her, later, I realized once more that it will not do for the
literary fraction of a combination to try to manage affairs which
properly belong in the office of the business bulk of it. I suppose the
President often acts just like that: goes and makes an impossible
promise, and you never find it out until it is next to impossible to
break it up and set things straight again. Well, that is just our way,
exactly-one half of the administration always busy getting the family
into trouble, and the other half busy getting it out again. And so we do
seem to be all pretty much alike, after all. The fact is, I had
forgotten that we were to have a dinner party on that Bridgeport date–I
thought it was the next day: which is a good deal of an improvement for
me, because I am more used to being behind a day or two than ahead. But
that is just the difference between one end of this kind of an
administration and the other end of it, as you have noticed,
yourself–the other end does not forget these things. Just so with a
funeral; if it is the man’s funeral, he is most always there, of course
–but that is no credit to him, he wouldn’t be there if you depended on
him to remember about it; whereas, if on the other hand–but I seem to
have got off from my line of argument somehow; never mind about the
funeral. Of course I am not meaning to say anything against funerals
–that is, as occasions–mere occasions–for as diversions I don’t think
they amount to much But as I was saying–if you are not busy I will look
back and see what it was I was saying.</p>
<p>I don’t seem to find the place; but anyway she was as sorry as ever
anybody could be that I could not go to Bridgeport, but there was no
help for it. And I, I have been not only sorry but very sincerely
ashamed of having made an engagement to go without first making sure
that I could keep it, and I do not know how to apologize enough for my
heedless breach of good manners. With the sincerest respect, S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Samuel Clemens was one of the very few authors to copyright a book in
England before the enactment of the international copyright law. As
early as 1872 he copyrighted ‘Roughing It’ in England, and piratical
publishers there respected his rights. Finally, in 1887, the inland
revenue office assessed him with income tax, which he very willingly
paid, instructing his London publishers, Chatto andandandand Windus, to
pay on the full amount he had received from them. But when the receipt
for his taxes came it was nearly a yard square with due postage of
considerable amount. Then he wrote:</p>
<p>To Mr. Chatto, of Chatto andandandand Windus, in London:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Dec. 5, ’87. MY DEAR CHATTO,–Look here, I don’t mind paying
the tax, but don’t you let the Inland Revenue Office send me any more
receipts for it, for the postage is something perfectly demoralizing. If
they feel obliged to print a receipt on a horse-blanket, why don’t they
hire a ship and send it over at their own expense?</p>
<p>Wasn’t it good that they caught me out with an old book instead of a
new one? The tax on a new book would bankrupt a body. It was my purpose
to go to England next May and stay the rest of the year, but I’ve found
that tax office out just in time. My new book would issue in March, and
they would tax the sale in both countries. Come, we must get up a
compromise somehow. You go and work in on the good side of those revenue
people and get them to take the profits and give me the tax. Then I will
come over and we will divide the swag and have a good time.</p>
<p>I wish you to thank Mr. Christmas for me; but we won’t resist. The
country that allows me copyright has a right to tax me. Sincerely Yours
S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Another English tax assessment came that year, based on the report
that it was understood that he was going to become an English resident,
and had leased Buckenham Hall, Norwich, for a year. Clemens wrote his
publishers: “I will explain that all that about Buckenham Hall was an
English newspaper’s mistake. I was not in England, and if I had been I
wouldn’t have been at Buckenham Hall, anyway, but at Buckingham Palace,
or I would have endeavored to find out the reason why.“ Clemens made
literature out of this tax experience. He wrote an open letter to Her
Majesty Queen Victoria. Such a letter has no place in this collection.
It was published in the “Drawer“ of Harper’s Magazine, December, 1887,
and is now included in the uniform edition of his works under the title
of, “A Petition to the Queen of England.“</p>
<p>From the following letter, written at the end of the year, we gather
that the type-setter costs were beginning to make a difference in the

<p>To Mrs. Moffett, in Fredonia:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Dec. 18, ’87. DEAR PAMELA,–will you take this 5 and buy
some candy or some other trifle for yourself and Sam and his wife to
remember that we remember you, by?</p>
<p>If we weren’t a little crowded this year by the typesetter, I’d send
a check large enough to buy a family Bible or some other useful thing
like that. However we go on and on, but the type-setter goes on
forever–at ,000 a month; which is much more satisfactory than was the
case the first seventeen months, when the bill only averaged ,000, and
promised to take a thousand years. We’ll be through, now, in 3 or 4
months, I reckon, and then the strain will let up and we can breathe
freely once more, whether success ensues or failure.</p>
<p>Even with a type-setter on hand we ought not to be in the least
scrimped –but it would take a long letter to explain why and who is to
blame.</p>
<p>All the family send love to all of you and best Christmas wishes for
your prosperity. Affectionately, SAM.</p>
<p>XXVIII</p>
