<h4 id="chapter-vi.">CHAPTER VI.</h4>
<p>We skip ten years and this history finds certain changes to
record.</p>
<p>Judge Hawkins and Col. Sellers have made and lost two or three
moderate fortunes in the meantime and are now pinched by poverty.
Sellers has two pairs of twins and four extras. In Hawkins’s family are
six children of his own and two adopted ones. From time to time, as
fortune smiled, the elder children got the benefit of it, spending the
lucky seasons at excellent schools in St. Louis and the unlucky ones at
home in the chafing discomfort of straightened circumstances.</p>
<p>Neither the Hawkins children nor the world that knew them ever
supposed that one of the girls was of alien blood and parentage: Such
difference as existed between Laura and Emily is not uncommon in a
family. The girls had grown up as sisters, and they were both too young
at the time of the fearful accident on the Mississippi to know that it
was that which had thrown their lives together.</p>
<p>And yet any one who had known the secret of Laura’s birth and had
seen her during these passing years, say at the happy age of twelve or
thirteen, would have fancied that he knew the reason why she was more
winsome than her school companion.</p>
<p>Philosophers dispute whether it is the promise of what she will be in
the careless school-girl, that makes her attractive, the undeveloped
maidenhood, or the mere natural, careless sweetness of childhood. If
Laura at twelve was beginning to be a beauty, the thought of it had
never entered her head. No, indeed. Her mind wad filled with more
important thoughts. To her simple school-girl dress she was beginning to
add those mysterious little adornments of ribbon-knots and ear-rings,
which were the subject of earnest consultations with her grown
friends.</p>
<p>When she tripped down the street on a summer’s day with her dainty
hands propped into the ribbon-broidered pockets of her apron, and elbows
consequently more or less akimbo with her wide Leghorn hat flapping down
and hiding her face one moment and blowing straight up against her fore
head the next and making its revealment of fresh young beauty; with all
her pretty girlish airs and graces in full play, and that sweet
ignorance of care and that atmosphere of innocence and purity all about
her that belong to her gracious time of life, indeed she was a vision to
warm the coldest heart and bless and cheer the saddest.</p>
<p>Willful, generous, forgiving, imperious, affectionate, improvident,
bewitching, in short–was Laura at this period. Could she have remained
there, this history would not need to be written. But Laura had grown to
be almost a woman in these few years, to the end of which we have now
come–years which had seen Judge Hawkins pass through so many trials.</p>
<p>When the judge’s first bankruptcy came upon him, a homely human angel
intruded upon him with an offer of ,500 for the Tennessee Land.
Mrs. Hawkins said take it. It was a grievous temptation, but the judge
withstood it. He said the land was for the children–he could not rob
them of their future millions for so paltry a sum. When the second
blight fell upon him, another angel appeared and offered ,000 for the
land. He was in such deep distress that he allowed his wife to persuade
him to let the papers be drawn; but when his children came into his
presence in their poor apparel, he felt like a traitor and refused to
sign.</p>
<p>But now he was down again, and deeper in the mire than ever. He paced
the floor all day, he scarcely slept at night. He blushed even to
acknowledge it to himself, but treason was in his mind–he was
meditating, at last, the sale of the land. Mrs. Hawkins stepped into the
room. He had not spoken a word, but he felt as guilty as if she had
caught him in some shameful act. She said:</p>
<p>“Si, I do not know what we are going to do. The children are not fit
to be seen, their clothes are in such a state. But there’s something
more serious still.–There is scarcely a bite in the house to eat“</p>
<p>“Why, Nancy, go to Johnson—-.“</p>
<p>“Johnson indeed! You took that man’s part when he hadn’t a friend in
the world, and you built him up and made him rich. And here’s the result
of it: He lives in our fine house, and we live in his miserable log
cabin. He has hinted to our children that he would rather they wouldn’t
come about his yard to play with his children,–which I can bear, and
bear easy enough, for they’re not a sort we want to associate with
much–but what I can’t bear with any quietness at all, is his telling
Franky our bill was running pretty high this morning when I sent him for
some meal –and that was all he said, too–didn’t give him the meal–turned
off and went to talking with the Hargrave girls about some stuff they
wanted to cheapen.“</p>
<p>“Nancy, this is astounding!“</p>
<p>“And so it is, I warrant you. I’ve kept still, Si, as long as ever I
could. Things have been getting worse and worse, and worse and worse,
every single day; I don’t go out of the house, I feel so down; but you
had trouble enough, and I wouldn’t say a word–and I wouldn’t say a word
now, only things have got so bad that I don’t know what to do, nor where
to turn.“ And she gave way and put her face in her hands and cried.</p>
<p>“Poor child, don’t grieve so. I never thought that of Johnson. I am
clear at my wit’s end. I don’t know what in the world to do. Now if
somebody would come along and offer ,000–Uh, if somebody only would come
along and offer ,000 for that Tennessee Land.“</p>
<p>“You’d sell it, S!“ said Mrs. Hawkins excitedly.</p>
<p>“Try me!“</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawkins was out of the room in a moment. Within a minute she was
back again with a business-looking stranger, whom she seated, and then
she took her leave again. Hawkins said to himself, “How can a man ever
lose faith? When the blackest hour comes, Providence always comes with
it–ah, this is the very timeliest help that ever poor harried devil had;
if this blessed man offers but a thousand I’ll embrace him like a
brother!“</p>
<p>The stranger said:</p>
<p>“I am aware that you own 75,000 acres, of land in East Tennessee, and
without sacrificing your time, I will come to the point at once. I am
agent of an iron manufacturing company, and they empower me to offer you
ten thousand dollars for that land.“</p>
<p>Hawkins’s heart bounded within him. His whole frame was racked and
wrenched with fettered hurrahs. His first impulse was to shout “Done!
and God bless the iron company, too!“</p>
<p>But a something flitted through his mind, and his opened lips uttered
nothing. The enthusiasm faded away from his eyes, and the look of a man
who is thinking took its place. Presently, in a hesitating, undecided
way, he said:</p>
<p>“Well, I–it don’t seem quite enough. That–that is a very valuable
property–very valuable. It’s brim full of iron-ore, sir–brim full of it!
And copper, coal,–everything–everything you can think of! Now, I’ll tell
you what I’ll, do. I’ll reserve everything except the iron, and I’ll
sell them the iron property for 5,000 cash, I to go in with them and own
an undivided interest of one-half the concern–or the stock, as you may
say. I’m out of business, and I’d just as soon help run the thing as
not. Now how does that strike you?“</p>
<p>“Well, I am only an agent of these people, who are friends of mine,
and I am not even paid for my services. To tell you the truth, I have
tried to persuade them not to go into the thing; and I have come square
out with their offer, without throwing out any feelers–and I did it in
the hope that you would refuse. A man pretty much always refuses another
man’s first offer, no matter what it is. But I have performed my duty,
and will take pleasure in telling them what you say.“</p>
<p>He was about to rise. Hawkins said,</p>
<p>“Wait a bit.“</p>
<p>Hawkins thought again. And the substance of his thought was: “This is
a deep man; this is a very deep man; I don’t like his candor; your
ostentatiously candid business man’s a deep fox–always a deep fox; this
man’s that iron company himself–that’s what he is; he wants that
property, too; I am not so blind but I can see that; he don’t want the
company to go into this thing–O, that’s very good; yes, that’s very good
indeed–stuff! he’ll be back here tomorrow, sure, and take my offer; take
it? I’ll risk anything he is suffering to take it now; here–I must mind
what I’m about. What has started this sudden excitement about iron? I
wonder what is in the wind? just as sure as I’m alive this moment,
there’s something tremendous stirring in iron speculation“ [here Hawkins
got up and began to pace the floor with excited eyes and with gesturing
hands]–“something enormous going on in iron, without the shadow of a
doubt, and here I sit mousing in the dark and never knowing anything
about it; great heaven, what an escape I’ve made! this underhanded
mercenary creature might have taken me up–and ruined me! but I have
escaped, and I warrant me I’ll not put my foot into–“</p>
<p>He stopped and turned toward the stranger; saying:</p>
<p>“I have made you a proposition, you have not accepted it, and I
desire that you will consider that I have made none. At the same time my
conscience will not allow me to–. Please alter the figures I named to
thirty thousand dollars, if you will, and let the proposition go to the
company–I will stick to it if it breaks my heart!“ The stranger looked
amused, and there was a pretty well defined touch of surprise in his
expression, too, but Hawkins never noticed it. Indeed he scarcely
noticed anything or knew what he was about. The man left; Hawkins flung
himself into a chair; thought a few moments, then glanced around, looked
frightened, sprang to the door—-</p>
<p>“Too late–too late! He’s gone! Fool that I am! always a fool! Thirty
thousand–ass that I am! Oh, why didn’t I say fifty thousand!“</p>
<p>He plunged his hands into his hair and leaned his elbows on his
knees, and fell to rocking himself back and forth in anguish.
Mrs. Hawkins sprang in, beaming:</p>
<p>“Well, Si?“</p>
<p>“Oh, con-found the con-founded–con-found it, Nancy. I’ve gone and
done it, now!“</p>
<p>“Done what Si for mercy’s sake!“</p>
<p>“Done everything! Ruined everything!“</p>
<p>“Tell me, tell me, tell me! Don’t keep a body in such suspense.
Didn’t he buy, after all? Didn’t he make an offer?“</p>
<p>Offer? He offered 0,000 for our land, and—-“</p>
<p>“Thank the good providence from the very bottom of my heart of
hearts! What sort of ruin do you call that, Si!“</p>
<p>“Nancy, do you suppose I listened to such a preposterous proposition?
No! Thank fortune I’m not a simpleton! I saw through the pretty scheme
in a second. It’s a vast iron speculation!–millions upon millions in it!
But fool as I am I told him he could have half the iron property for
thirty thousand–and if I only had him back here he couldn’t touch it for
a cent less than a quarter of a million!“</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawkins looked up white and despairing:</p>
<p>“You threw away this chance, you let this man go, and we in this
awful trouble? You don’t mean it, you can’t mean it!“</p>
<p>“Throw it away? Catch me at it! Why woman, do you suppose that man
don’t know what he is about? Bless you, he’ll be back fast enough
to-morrow.“</p>
<p>“Never, never, never. He never will comeback. I don’t know what is to
become of us. I don’t know what in the world is to become of us.“</p>
<p>A shade of uneasiness came into Hawkins’s face. He said:</p>
<p>“Why, Nancy, you–you can’t believe what you are saying.“</p>
<p>“Believe it, indeed? I know it, Si. And I know that we haven’t a cent
in the world, and we’ve sent ten thousand dollars a-begging.“</p>
<p>“Nancy, you frighten me. Now could that man–is it possible that I
–hanged if I don’t believe I have missed a chance! Don’t grieve, Nancy,
don’t grieve. I’ll go right after him. I’ll take–I’ll take–what a fool I
am!–I’ll take anything he’ll give!“</p>
<p>The next instant he left the house on a run. But the man was no
longer in the town. Nobody knew where he belonged or whither he had
gone. Hawkins came slowly back, watching wistfully but hopelessly for
the stranger, and lowering his price steadily with his sinking heart.
And when his foot finally pressed his own threshold, the value he held
the entire Tennessee property at was five hundred dollars–two hundred
down and the rest in three equal annual payments, without interest.</p>
<p>There was a sad gathering at the Hawkins fireside the next night. All
the children were present but Clay. Mr. Hawkins said:</p>
<p>“Washington, we seem to be hopelessly fallen, hopelessly involved. I
am ready to give up. I do not know where to turn–I never have been down
so low before, I never have seen things so dismal. There are many mouths
to feed; Clay is at work; we must lose you, also, for a little while, my
boy. But it will not be long–the Tennessee land—-“</p>
<p>He stopped, and was conscious of a blush. There was silence for a
moment, and then Washington–now a lank, dreamy-eyed stripling between
twenty-two and twenty-three years of age–said:</p>
<p>“If Col. Sellers would come for me, I would go and stay with him a
while, till the Tennessee land is sold. He has often wanted me to come,
ever since he moved to Hawkeye.“</p>
<p>“I’m afraid he can’t well come for you, Washington. From what I can
hear–not from him of course, but from others–he is not far from as bad
off as we are–and his family is as large, too. He might find something
for you to do, maybe, but you’d better try to get to him yourself,
Washington–it’s only thirty miles.“</p>
<p>“But how can I, father? There’s no stage or anything.“</p>
<p>“And if there were, stages require money. A stage goes from Swansea,
five miles from here. But it would be cheaper to walk.“</p>
<p>“Father, they must know you there, and no doubt they would credit you
in a moment, for a little stage ride like that. Couldn’t you write and
ask them?“</p>
<p>“Couldn’t you, Washington–seeing it’s you that wants the ride? And
what do you think you’ll do, Washington, when you get to Hawkeye? Finish
your invention for making window-glass opaque?“</p>
<p>“No, sir, I have given that up. I almost knew I could do it, but it
was so tedious and troublesome I quit it.“</p>
<p>“I was afraid of it, my boy. Then I suppose you’ll finish your plan
of coloring hen’s eggs by feeding a peculiar diet to the hen?“</p>
<p>“No, sir. I believe I have found out the stuff that will do it, but
it kills the hen; so I have dropped that for the present, though I can
take it up again some day when I learn how to manage the mixture
better.“</p>
<p>“Well, what have you got on hand–anything?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, three or four things. I think they are all good and can
all be done, but they are tiresome, and besides they require money. But
as soon as the land is sold—-“</p>
<p>“Emily, were you about to say something?“ said Hawkins.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. If you are willing, I will go to St. Louis. That will make
another mouth less to feed. Mrs. Buckner has always wanted me to
come.“</p>
<p>“But the money, child?“</p>
<p>“Why I think she would send it, if you would write her–and I know she
would wait for her pay till—-“</p>
<p>“Come, Laura, let’s hear from you, my girl.“</p>
<p>Emily and Laura were about the same age–between seventeen and
eighteen. Emily was fair and pretty, girlish and diffident–blue eyes and
light hair. Laura had a proud bearing, and a somewhat mature look; she
had fine, clean-cut features, her complexion was pure white and
contrasted vividly with her black hair and eyes; she was not what one
calls pretty –she was beautiful. She said:</p>
<p>“I will go to St. Louis, too, sir. I will find a way to get there. I
will make a way. And I will find a way to help myself along, and do what
I can to help the rest, too.“</p>
<p>She spoke it like a princess. Mrs. Hawkins smiled proudly and kissed
her, saying in a tone of fond reproof:</p>
<p>“So one of my girls is going to turn out and work for her living!
It’s like your pluck and spirit, child, but we will hope that we haven’t
got quite down to that, yet.“</p>
<p>The girl’s eyes beamed affection under her mother’s caress. Then she
straightened up, folded her white hands in her lap and became a splendid
ice-berg. Clay’s dog put up his brown nose for a little attention, and
got it. He retired under the table with an apologetic yelp, which did
not affect the iceberg.</p>
<p>Judge Hawkins had written and asked Clay to return home and consult
with him upon family affairs. He arrived the evening after this
conversation, and the whole household gave him a rapturous welcome. He
brought sadly needed help with him, consisting of the savings of a year
and a half of work–nearly two hundred dollars in money.</p>
<p>It was a ray of sunshine which (to this easy household) was the
earnest of a clearing sky.</p>
<p>Bright and early in the morning the family were astir, and all were
busy preparing Washington for his journey–at least all but Washington
himself, who sat apart, steeped in a reverie. When the time for his
departure came, it was easy to see how fondly all loved him and how hard
it was to let him go, notwithstanding they had often seen him go before,
in his St. Louis schooling days. In the most matter-of-course way they
had borne the burden of getting him ready for his trip, never seeming to
think of his helping in the matter; in the same matter-of-course way
Clay had hired a horse and cart; and now that the good-byes were ended
he bundled Washington’s baggage in and drove away with the exile.</p>
<p>At Swansea Clay paid his stage fare, stowed him away in the vehicle,
and saw him off. Then he returned home and reported progress, like a
committee of the whole.</p>
<p>Clay remained at home several days. He held many consultations with
his mother upon the financial condition of the family, and talked once
with his father upon the same subject, but only once. He found a change
in that quarter which was distressing; years of fluctuating fortune had
done their work; each reverse had weakened the father’s spirit and
impaired his energies; his last misfortune seemed to have left hope and
ambition dead within him; he had no projects, formed no plans–evidently
he was a vanquished man. He looked worn and tired. He inquired into
Clay’s affairs and prospects, and when he found that Clay was doing
pretty well and was likely to do still better, it was plain that he
resigned himself with easy facility to look to the son for a support;
and he said, “Keep yourself informed of poor Washington’s condition and
movements, and help him along all you can, Clay.“</p>
<p>The younger children, also, seemed relieved of all fears and
distresses, and very ready and willing to look to Clay for a livelihood.
Within three days a general tranquility and satisfaction reigned in the
household. Clay’s hundred and eighty or ninety, dollars had worked a
wonder. The family were as contented, now, and as free from care as they
could have been with a fortune. It was well that Mrs. Hawkins held the
purse otherwise the treasure would have lasted but a very little
while.</p>
<p>It took but a trifle to pay Hawkins’s outstanding obligations, for he
had always had a horror of debt.</p>
<p>When Clay bade his home good-bye and set out to return to the field
of his labors, he was conscious that henceforth he was to have his
father’s family on his hands as pensioners; but he did not allow himself
to chafe at the thought, for he reasoned that his father had dealt by
him with a free hand and a loving one all his life, and now that hard
fortune had broken his spirit it ought to be a pleasure, not a pain, to
work for him. The younger children were born and educated dependents.
They had never been taught to do anything for themselves, and it did not
seem to occur to them to make an attempt now.</p>
<p>The girls would not have been permitted to work for a living under
any circumstances whatever. It was a southern family, and of good blood;
