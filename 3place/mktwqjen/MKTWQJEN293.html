<h4 id="legend-of-sagenfeld-in-germany">LEGEND OF SAGENFELD, IN
GERMANY</h4>
<p>–[Left out of “A Tramp Abroad“ because its authenticity seemed
doubtful, and could not at that time be proved.–M. T.]</p>
<p>More than a thousand years ago this small district was a kingdom –a
little bit of a kingdom, a sort of dainty little toy kingdom, as one
might say. It was far removed from the jealousies, strifes, and turmoils
of that old warlike day, and so its life was a simple life, its people a
gentle and guileless race; it lay always in a deep dream of peace, a
soft Sabbath tranquillity; there was no malice, there was no envy, there
was no ambition, consequently there were no heart-burnings, there was no
unhappiness in the land.</p>
<p>In the course of time the old king died and his little son Hubert
came to the throne. The people’s love for him grew daily; he was so good
and so pure and so noble, that by and by his love became a passion,
almost a worship. Now at his birth the soothsayers had diligently
studied the stars and found something written in that shining book to
this effect:</p>
<p>In Hubert’s fourteenth year a pregnant event will happen; the animal
whose singing shall sound sweetest in Hubert’s ear shall save Hubert’s
life. So long as the king and the nation shall honor this animal’s race
for this good deed, the ancient dynasty shall not fail of an heir, nor
the nation know war or pestilence or poverty. But beware an erring
choice!</p>
<p>All through the king’s thirteenth year but one thing was talked of by
the soothsayers, the statesmen, the little parliament, and the general
people. That one thing was this: How is the last sentence of the
prophecy to be understood? What goes before seems to mean that the
saving animal will choose itself at the proper time; but the closing
sentence seems to mean that the king must choose beforehand, and say
what singer among the animals pleases him best, and that if he choose
wisely the chosen animal will save his life, his dynasty, his people,
but that if he should make “an erring choice“–beware!</p>
<p>By the end of the year there were as many opinions about this matter
as there had been in the beginning; but a majority of the wise and the
simple were agreed that the safest plan would be for the little king to
make choice beforehand, and the earlier the better. So an edict was sent
forth commanding all persons who owned singing creatures to bring them
to the great hall of the palace in the morning of the first day of the
new year. This command was obeyed. When everything was in readiness for
the trial, the king made his solemn entry with the great officers of the
crown, all clothed in their robes of state. The king mounted his golden
throne and prepared to give judgment. But he presently said:</p>
<p>“These creatures all sing at once; the noise is unendurable; no one
can choose in such a turmoil. Take them all away, and bring back one at
a time.“</p>
<p>This was done. One sweet warbler after another charmed the young
king’s ear and was removed to make way for another candidate. The
precious minutes slipped by; among so many bewitching songsters he found
it hard to choose, and all the harder because the promised penalty for
an error was so terrible that it unsettled his judgment and made him
afraid to trust his own ears. He grew nervous and his face showed
distress. His ministers saw this, for they never took their eyes from
him a moment. Now they began to say in their hearts:</p>
<p>“He has lost courage–the cool head is gone–he will err–he and his
dynasty and his people are doomed!“</p>
<p>At the end of an hour the king sat silent awhile, and then said:</p>
<p>“Bring back the linnet.“</p>
<p>The linnet trilled forth her jubilant music. In the midst of it the
king was about to uplift his scepter in sign of choice, but checked
himself and said:</p>
<p>“But let us be sure. Bring back the thrush; let them sing
together.“</p>
<p>The thrush was brought, and the two birds poured out their marvels of
song together. The king wavered, then his inclination began to settle
and strengthen–one could see it in his countenance. Hope budded in the
hearts of the old ministers, their pulses began to beat quicker, the
scepter began to rise slowly, when: There was a hideous interruption! It
was a sound like this–just at the door:</p>
<p>“Waw . . . he! waw . . . he! waw-he!-waw he!-waw-he!“</p>
<p>Everybody was sorely startled–and enraged at himself for showing
it.</p>
<p>The next instant the dearest, sweetest, prettiest little peasant-maid
of nine years came tripping in, her brown eyes glowing with childish
eagerness; but when she saw that august company and those angry faces
she stopped and hung her head and put her poor coarse apron to her eyes.
Nobody gave her welcome, none pitied her. Presently she looked up
timidly through her tears, and said:</p>
<p>“My lord the king, I pray you pardon me, for I meant no wrong. I have
no father and no mother, but I have a goat and a donkey, and they are
all in all to me. My goat gives me the sweetest milk, and when my dear
good donkey brays it seems to me there is no music like to it. So when
my lord the king’s jester said the sweetest singer among all the animals
should save the crown and nation, and moved me to bring him here–“</p>
<p>All the court burst into a rude laugh, and the child fled away
crying, without trying to finish her speech. The chief minister gave a
private order that she and her disastrous donkey be flogged beyond the
precincts of the palace and commanded to come within them no more.</p>
<p>Then the trial of the birds was resumed. The two birds sang their
best, but the scepter lay motionless in the king’s hand. Hope died
slowly out in the breasts of all. An hour went by; two hours, still no
decision. The day waned to its close, and the waiting multitudes outside
the palace grew crazed with anxiety and apprehension. The twilight came
on, the shadows fell deeper and deeper. The king and his court could no
longer see each other’s faces. No one spoke–none called for lights. The
great trial had been made; it had failed; each and all wished to hide
their faces from the light and cover up their deep trouble in their own
hearts.</p>
<p>Finally-hark! A rich, full strain of the divinest melody streamed
forth from a remote part of the hall the nightingale’s voice!</p>
<p>“Up!“ shouted the king, “let all the bells make proclamation to the
people, for the choice is made and we have not erred. King, dynasty, and
nation are saved. From henceforth let the nightingale be honored
throughout the land forever. And publish it among all the people that
whosoever shall insult a nightingale, or injure it, shall suffer death.
The king hath spoken.“</p>
<p>All that little world was drunk with joy. The castle and the city
blazed with bonfires all night long, the people danced and drank and
sang; and the triumphant clamor of the bells never ceased.</p>
<p>From that day the nightingale was a sacred bird. Its song was heard
in every house; the poets wrote its praises; the painters painted it;
its sculptured image adorned every arch and turret and fountain and
public building. It was even taken into the king’s councils; and no
grave matter of state was decided until the soothsayers had laid the
thing before the state nightingale and translated to the ministry what
it was that the bird had sung about it.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The young king was very fond of the chase. When the summer was come
he rode forth with hawk and hound, one day, in a brilliant company of
his nobles. He got separated from them by and by, in a great forest, and
took what he imagined a neat cut, to find them again; but it was a
mistake. He rode on and on, hopefully at first, but with sinking courage
finally. Twilight came on, and still he was plunging through a lonely
and unknown land. Then came a catastrophe. In the dim light he forced
his horse through a tangled thicket overhanging a steep and rocky
declivity. When horse and rider reached the bottom, the former had a
broken neck and the latter a broken leg. The poor little king lay there
suffering agonies of pain, and each hour seemed a long month to him. He
kept his ear strained to hear any sound that might promise hope of
rescue; but he heard no voice, no sound of horn or bay of hound. So at
last he gave up all hope, and said, “Let death come, for come it
must.“</p>
<p>Just then the deep, sweet song of a nightingale swept across the
still wastes of the night.</p>
<p>“Saved!“ the king said. “Saved! It is the sacred bird, and the
prophecy is come true. The gods themselves protected me from error in
the choice.“</p>
<p>He could hardly contain his joy; he could not word his gratitude.
Every few moments, now he thought he caught the sound of approaching
succor. But each time it was a disappointment; no succor came. The dull
hours drifted on. Still no help came–but still the sacred bird sang on.
He began to have misgivings about his choice, but he stifled them.
Toward dawn the bird ceased. The morning came, and with it thirst and
hunger; but no succor. The day waxed and waned. At last the king cursed
the nightingale.</p>
<p>Immediately the song of the thrush came from out the wood. The king
said in his heart, “This was the true-bird–my choice was false–succor
will come now.“</p>
<p>But it did not come. Then he lay many hours insensible. When he came
to himself, a linnet was singing. He listened with apathy. His faith was
gone. “These birds,“ he said, “can bring no help; I and my house and my
people are doomed.“ He turned him about to die; for he was grown very
feeble from hunger and thirst and suffering, and felt that his end was
near. In truth, he wanted to die, and be released from pain. For long
hours he lay without thought or feeling or motion. Then his senses
returned. The dawn of the third morning was breaking. Ah, the world
seemed very beautiful to those worn eyes. Suddenly a great longing to
live rose up in the lad’s heart, and from his soul welled a deep and
fervent prayer that Heaven would have mercy upon him and let him see his
home and his friends once more. In that instant a soft, a faint, a
far-off sound, but oh, how inexpressibly sweet to his waiting ear, came
floating out of the distance:</p>
<p>“Waw . . . he! waw . . . he! waw-he!–waw-he!–waw-he!“</p>
<p>“That, oh, that song is sweeter, a thousand times sweeter than the
voice of the nightingale, thrush, or linnet, for it brings not mere
hope, but certainty of succor; and now, indeed, am I saved! The sacred
singer has chosen itself, as the oracle intended; the prophecy is
fulfilled, and my life, my house, and my people are redeemed. The ass
shall be sacred from this day!“</p>
<p>The divine music grew nearer and nearer, stronger and stronger and
ever sweeter and sweeter to the perishing sufferer’s ear. Down the
declivity the docile little donkey wandered, cropping herbage and
singing as he went; and when at last he saw the dead horse and the
wounded king, he came and snuffed at them with simple and marveling
curiosity. The king petted him, and he knelt down as had been his wont
when his little mistress desired to mount. With great labor and pain the
lad drew himself upon the creature’s back, and held himself there by aid
of the generous ears. The ass went singing forth from the place and
carried the king to the little peasant-maid’s hut. She gave him her
pallet for a bed, refreshed him with goat’s milk, and then flew to tell
the great news to the first scouting-party of searchers she might
meet.</p>
<p>The king got well. His first act was to proclaim the sacredness and
inviolability of the ass; his second was to add this particular ass to
his cabinet and make him chief minister of the crown; his third was to
have all the statues and effigies of nightingales throughout his kingdom
destroyed, and replaced by statues and effigies of the sacred donkey;
and, his fourth was to announce that when the little peasant maid should
reach her fifteenth year he would make her his queen and he kept his
word.</p>
<p>Such is the legend. This explains why the moldering image of the ass
adorns all these old crumbling walls and arches; and it explains why,
during many centuries, an ass was always the chief minister in that
royal cabinet, just as is still the case in most cabinets to this day;
and it also explains why, in that little kingdom, during many centuries,
all great poems, all great speeches, all great books, all public
solemnities, and all royal proclamations, always began with these
stirring words:</p>
<p>“Waw . . . he! waw . . . he!–waw he! Waw-he!“</p>
