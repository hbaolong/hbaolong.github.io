<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>No one doubts–certainly not I–that the mind exercises a powerful
influence over the body. From the beginning of time, the sorcerer, the
interpreter of dreams, the fortune-teller, the charlatan, the quack, the
wild medicine-man, the educated physician, the mesmerist, and the
hypnotist have made use of the client’s imagination to help them in
their work. They have all recognized the potency and availability of
that force. Physicians cure many patients with a bread pill; they know
that where the disease is only a fancy, the patient’s confidence in the
doctor will make the bread pill effective.</p>
<p>Faith in the doctor. Perhaps that is the entire thing. It seems to
look like it. In old times the King cured the king’s evil by the touch
of the royal hand. He frequently made extraordinary cures. Could his
footman have done it? No–not in his own clothes. Disguised as the King,
could he have done it? I think we may not doubt it. I think we may feel
sure that it was not the King’s touch that made the cure in any
instance, but the patient’s faith in the efficacy of a King’s touch.
Genuine and remarkable cures have been achieved through contact with the
relics of a saint. Is it not likely that any other bones would have done
as well if the substitution had been concealed from the patient? When I
was a boy a farmer’s wife who lived five miles from our village had
great fame as a faith-doctor–that was what she called herself. Sufferers
came to her from all around, and she laid her hand upon them and said,
“Have faith –it is all that is necessary,“ and they went away well of
their ailments. She was not a religious woman, and pretended to no
occult powers. She said that the patient’s faith in her did the work.
Several times I saw her make immediate cures of severe toothaches. My
mother was the patient. In Austria there is a peasant who drives a great
trade in this sort of industry, and has both the high and the low for
patients. He gets into prison every now and then for practising without
a diploma, but his business is as brisk as ever when he gets out, for
his work is unquestionably successful and keeps his reputation high. In
Bavaria there is a man who performed so many great cures that he had to
retire from his profession of stage-carpentering in order to meet the
demand of his constantly increasing body of customers. He goes on from
year to year doing his miracles, and has become very rich. He pretends
to no religious helps, no supernatural aids, but thinks there is
something in his make-up which inspires the confidence of his patients,
and that it is this confidence which does the work, and not some
mysterious power issuing from himself.</p>
<p>Within the last quarter of a century, in America, several sects of
curers have appeared under various names and have done notable things in
the way of healing ailments without the use of medicines. There are the
Mind Cure the Faith Cure, the Prayer Cure, the Mental Science Cure, and
the Christian-Science Cure; and apparently they all do their miracles
with the same old, powerful instrument–the patient’s imagination.
Differing names, but no difference in the process. But they do not give
that instrument the credit; each sect claims that its way differs from
the ways of the others.</p>
<p>They all achieve some cures, there is no question about it; and the
Faith Cure and the Prayer Cure probably do no harm when they do no good,
since they do not forbid the patient to help out the cure with medicines
if he wants to; but the others bar medicines, and claim ability to cure
every conceivable human ailment through the application of their mental
forces alone. There would seem to be an element of danger here. It has
the look of claiming too much, I think. Public confidence would probably
be increased if less were claimed.</p>
<p>The Christian Scientist was not able to cure my stomach-ache and my
cold; but the horse-doctor did it. This convinces me that Christian
Science claims too much. In my opinion it ought to let diseases alone
and confine itself to surgery. There it would have everything its own
way.</p>
<p>The horse-doctor charged me thirty kreutzers, and I paid him; in
fact, I doubled it and gave him a shilling. Mrs. Fuller brought in an
itemized bill for a crate of broken bones mended in two hundred and
thirty-four places–one dollar per fracture.</p>
<p>“Nothing exists but Mind?“</p>
<p>“Nothing,“ she answered. “All else is substanceless, all else is
imaginary.“</p>
<p>I gave her an imaginary check, and now she is suing me for
substantial dollars. It looks inconsistent.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>Let us consider that we are all partially insane. It will explain us
to each other; it will unriddle many riddles; it will make clear and
simple many things which are involved in haunting and harassing
difficulties and obscurities now.</p>
<p>Those of us who are not in the asylum, and not demonstrably due
there, are nevertheless, no doubt, insane in one or two particulars. I
think we must admit this; but I think that we are otherwise
healthy-minded. I think that when we all see one thing alike, it is
evidence that, as regards that one thing, our minds are perfectly sound.
Now there are really several things which we do all see alike; things
which we all accept, and about which we do not dispute. For instance, we
who are outside of the asylum all agree that water seeks its level; that
the sun gives light and heat; that fire consumes; that fog is damp; that
six times six are thirty-six, that two from ten leaves eight; that eight
and seven are fifteen. These are, perhaps, the only things we are agreed
about; but, although they are so few, they are of inestimable value,
because they make an infallible standard of sanity. Whosoever accepts
them him we know to be substantially sane; sufficiently sane; in the
working essentials, sane. Whoever disputes a single one of them him we
know to be wholly insane, and qualified for the asylum.</p>
<p>Very well, the man who disputes none of them we concede to be
entitled to go at large. But that is concession enough. We cannot go any
further than that; for we know that in all matters of mere opinion that
same man is insane–just as insane as we are; just as insane as
Shakespeare was. We know exactly where to put our finger upon his
insanity: it is where his opinion differs from ours.</p>
<p>That is a simple rule, and easy to remember. When I, a thoughtful and
unblessed Presbyterian, examine the Koran, I know that beyond any
question every Mohammedan is insane; not in all things, but in religious
matters. When a thoughtful and unblessed Mohammedan examines the
Westminster Catechism, he knows that beyond any question I am
spiritually insane. I cannot prove to him that he is insane, because you
never can prove anything to a lunatic–for that is a part of his insanity
and the evidence of it. He cannot prove to me that I am insane, for my
mind has the same defect that afflicts his. All Democrats are insane,
but not one of them knows it; none but the Republicans and Mugwumps know
it. All the Republicans are insane, but only the Democrats and Mugwumps
can perceive it. The rule is perfect: in all matters of opinion our
adversaries are insane. When I look around me, I am often troubled to
see how many people are mad. To mention only a few:</p>
<p>The Atheist, The Theosophists, The Infidel, The Swedenborgians, The
Agnostic, The Shakers, The Baptist, The Millerites, The Methodist, The
Mormons, The Christian Scientist, The Laurence Oliphant Harrisites, The
Catholic, and the 115 Christian sects, the Presbyterian excepted, The
Grand Lama’s people, The Monarchists, The Imperialists, The 72
Mohammedan sects, The Democrats, The Republicans (but not the Mugwumps),
The Buddhist, The Blavatsky-Buddhist, The Mind-Curists, The
Faith-Curists, The Nationalist, The Mental Scientists, The Confucian,
The Spiritualist, The Allopaths, The 2000 East Indian sects, The
Homeopaths, The Electropaths, The Peculiar People, The–</p>
<p>But there’s no end to the list; there are millions of them! And all
insane; each in his own way; insane as to his pet fad or opinion, but
otherwise sane and rational. This should move us to be charitable
towards one another’s lunacies. I recognize that in his special belief
the Christian Scientist is insane, because he does not believe as I do;
but I hail him as my mate and fellow, because I am as insane as he
insane from his point of view, and his point of view is as authoritative
as mine and worth as much. That is to say, worth a brass farthing. Upon
a great religious or political question, the opinion of the dullest head
in the world is worth the same as the opinion of the brightest head in
the world–a brass farthing. How do we arrive at this? It is simple. The
affirmative opinion of a stupid man is neutralized by the negative
opinion of his stupid neighbor no decision is reached; the affirmative
opinion of the intellectual giant Gladstone is neutralized by the
negative opinion of the intellectual giant Newman–no decision is
reached. Opinions that prove nothing are, of course, without value any
but a dead person knows that much. This obliges us to admit the truth of
the unpalatable proposition just mentioned above–that, in disputed
matters political and religious, one man’s opinion is worth no more than
his peer’s, and hence it followers that no man’s opinion possesses any
real value. It is a humbling thought, but there is no way to get around
it: all opinions upon these great subjects are brass-farthing
opinions.</p>
<p>It is a mere plain, simple fact–as clear and as certain as that eight
and seven make fifteen. And by it we recognize that we are all insane,
as concerns those matters. If we were sane, we should all see a
political or religious doctrine alike; there would be no dispute: it
would be a case of eight and seven–just as it is in heaven, where all
are sane and none insane. There there is but one religion, one belief;
the harmony is perfect; there is never a discordant note.</p>
<p>Under protection of these preliminaries, I suppose I may now repeat
without offence that the Christian Scientist is insane. I mean him no
discourtesy, and I am not charging–nor even imagining–that he is insaner
than the rest of the human race. I think he is more picturesquely insane
than some of us. At the same time, I am quite sure that in one important
and splendid particular he is much saner than is the vast bulk of the
race.</p>
<p>Why is he insane? I told you before: it is because his opinions are
not ours. I know of no other reason, and I do not need any other; it is
the only way we have of discovering insanity when it is not violent. It
is merely the picturesqueness of his insanity that makes it more
interesting than my kind or yours. For instance, consider his “little
book“; the “little book“ exposed in the sky eighteen centuries ago by
the flaming angel of the Apocalypse, and handed down in our day to
Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy, of New Hampshire, and translated by her, word
for word, into English (with help of a polisher), and now published and
distributed in hundreds of editions by her at a clear profit per volume,
above cost, of seven hundred per cent.!–a profit which distinctly
belongs to the angel of the Apocalypse, and let him collect it if he
can; a “little book“ which the C.S. very frequently calls by just that
name, and always enclosed in quotation-marks to keep its high origin
exultantly in mind; a “little book“ which “explains“ and reconstructs
and new-paints and decorates the Bible, and puts a mansard roof on it
and a lightning-rod and all the other modern improvements; a “little
book“ which for the present affects to travel in yoke with the Bible and
be friendly to it, and within half a century will hitch the Bible in the
rear and thenceforth travel tandem, itself in the lead, in the coming
great march of Christian Scientism through the Protestant dominions of
the planet.</p>
