<h4 id="chapter-xii-what-the-wives-saved">Chapter XII [What the Wives
Saved]</h4>
<p>The RATHHAUS, or municipal building, is of the quaintest and most
picturesque Middle-Age architecture. It has a massive portico and steps,
before it, heavily balustraded, and adorned with life-sized rusty iron
knights in complete armor. The clock-face on the front of the building
is very large and of curious pattern. Ordinarily, a gilded angel strikes
the hour on a big bell with a hammer; as the striking ceases, a
life-sized figure of Time raises its hour-glass and turns it; two golden
rams advance and butt each other; a gilded cock lifts its wings; but the
main features are two great angels, who stand on each side of the dial
with long horns at their lips; it was said that they blew melodious
blasts on these horns every hour–but they did not do it for us. We were
told, later, than they blew only at night, when the town was still.</p>
<p>Within the RATHHAUS were a number of huge wild boars’ heads,
preserved, and mounted on brackets along the wall; they bore
inscriptions telling who killed them and how many hundred years ago it
was done. One room in the building was devoted to the preservation of
ancient archives. There they showed us no end of aged documents; some
were signed by Popes, some by Tilly and other great generals, and one
was a letter written and subscribed by Goetz von Berlichingen in
Heilbronn in 1519 just after his release from the Square Tower.</p>
<p>This fine old robber-knight was a devoutly and sincerely religious
man, hospitable, charitable to the poor, fearless in fight, active,
enterprising, and possessed of a large and generous nature. He had in
him a quality of being able to overlook moderate injuries, and being
able to forgive and forget mortal ones as soon as he had soundly
trounced the authors of them. He was prompt to take up any poor devil’s
quarrel and risk his neck to right him. The common folk held him dear,
and his memory is still green in ballad and tradition. He used to go on
the highway and rob rich wayfarers; and other times he would swoop down
from his high castle on the hills of the Neckar and capture passing
cargoes of merchandise. In his memoirs he piously thanks the Giver of
all Good for remembering him in his needs and delivering sundry such
cargoes into his hands at times when only special providences could have
relieved him. He was a doughty warrior and found a deep joy in battle.
In an assault upon a stronghold in Bavaria when he was only twenty-three
years old, his right hand was shot away, but he was so interested in the
fight that he did not observe it for a while. He said that the iron hand
which was made for him afterward, and which he wore for more than half a
century, was nearly as clever a member as the fleshy one had been. I was
glad to get a facsimile of the letter written by this fine old German
Robin Hood, though I was not able to read it. He was a better artist
with his sword than with his pen.</p>
<p>We went down by the river and saw the Square Tower. It was a very
venerable structure, very strong, and very ornamental. There was no
opening near the ground. They had to use a ladder to get into it, no
doubt.</p>
<p>We visited the principal church, also–a curious old structure, with a
towerlike spire adorned with all sorts of grotesque images. The inner
walls of the church were placarded with large mural tablets of copper,
bearing engraved inscriptions celebrating the merits of old Heilbronn
worthies of two or three centuries ago, and also bearing rudely painted
effigies of themselves and their families tricked out in the queer
costumes of those days. The head of the family sat in the foreground,
and beyond him extended a sharply receding and diminishing row of sons;
facing him sat his wife, and beyond her extended a low row of
diminishing daughters. The family was usually large, but the perspective
bad.</p>
<p>Then we hired the hack and the horse which Goetz von Berlichingen
used to use, and drove several miles into the country to visit the place
called WEIBERTREU–Wife’s Fidelity I suppose it means. It was a feudal
castle of the Middle Ages. When we reached its neighborhood we found it
was beautifully situated, but on top of a mound, or hill, round and
tolerably steep, and about two hundred feet high. Therefore, as the sun
was blazing hot, we did not climb up there, but took the place on trust,
and observed it from a distance while the horse leaned up against a
fence and rested. The place has no interest except that which is lent it
by its legend, which is a very pretty one–to this effect:</p>
<p>THE LEGEND</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, a couple of young dukes, brothers, took opposite
sides in one of the wars, the one fighting for the Emperor, the other
against him. One of them owned the castle and village on top of the
mound which I have been speaking of, and in his absence his brother came
with his knights and soldiers and began a siege. It was a long and
tedious business, for the people made a stubborn and faithful defense.
But at last their supplies ran out and starvation began its work; more
fell by hunger than by the missiles of the enemy. They by and by
surrendered, and begged for charitable terms. But the beleaguering
prince was so incensed against them for their long resistance that he
said he would spare none but the women and children–all men should be
put to the sword without exception, and all their goods destroyed. Then
the women came and fell on their knees and begged for the lives of their
husbands.</p>
<p>“No,“ said the prince, “not a man of them shall escape alive; you
yourselves shall go with your children into houseless and friendless
banishment; but that you may not starve I grant you this one grace, that
each woman may bear with her from this place as much of her most
valuable property as she is able to carry.“</p>
<p>Very well, presently the gates swung open and out filed those women
carrying their HUSBANDS on their shoulders. The besiegers, furious at
the trick, rushed forward to slaughter the men, but the Duke stepped
between and said:</p>
<p>“No, put up your swords–a prince’s word is inviolable.“</p>
<p>When we got back to the hotel, King Arthur’s Round Table was ready
for us in its white drapery, and the head waiter and his first
assistant, in swallow-tails and white cravats, brought in the soup and
the hot plates at once.</p>
<p>Mr. X had ordered the dinner, and when the wine came on, he picked up
a bottle, glanced at the label, and then turned to the grave, the
melancholy, the sepulchral head waiter and said it was not the sort of
wine he had asked for. The head waiter picked up the bottle, cast his
undertaker-eye on it and said:</p>
<p>“It is true; I beg pardon.“ Then he turned on his subordinate and
calmly said, “Bring another label.“</p>
<p>At the same time he slid the present label off with his hand and laid
it aside; it had been newly put on, its paste was still wet. When the
new label came, he put it on; our French wine being now turned into
German wine, according to desire, the head waiter went blandly about his
other duties, as if the working of this sort of miracle was a common and
easy thing to him.</p>
<p>Mr. X said he had not known, before, that there were people honest
enough to do this miracle in public, but he was aware that thousands
upon thousands of labels were imported into America from Europe every
year, to enable dealers to furnish to their customers in a quiet and
inexpensive way all the different kinds of foreign wines they might
require.</p>
<p>We took a turn around the town, after dinner, and found it fully as
interesting in the moonlight as it had been in the daytime. The streets
were narrow and roughly paved, and there was not a sidewalk or a
street-lamp anywhere. The dwellings were centuries old, and vast enough
for hotels. They widened all the way up; the stories projected further
and further forward and aside as they ascended, and the long rows of
lighted windows, filled with little bits of panes, curtained with
figured white muslin and adorned outside with boxes of flowers, made a
pretty effect. The moon was bright, and the light and shadow very
strong; and nothing could be more picturesque than those curving
streets, with their rows of huge high gables leaning far over toward
each other in a friendly gossiping way, and the crowds below drifting
through the alternating blots of gloom and mellow bars of moonlight.
Nearly everybody was abroad, chatting, singing, romping, or massed in
lazy comfortable attitudes in the doorways.</p>
<p>In one place there was a public building which was fenced about with
a thick, rusty chain, which sagged from post to post in a succession of
low swings. The pavement, here, was made of heavy blocks of stone. In
the glare of the moon a party of barefooted children were swinging on
those chains and having a noisy good time. They were not the first ones
who have done that; even their great-great-grandfathers had not been the
first to do it when they were children. The strokes of the bare feet had
worn grooves inches deep in the stone flags; it had taken many
generations of swinging children to accomplish that. Everywhere in the
town were the mold and decay that go with antiquity, and evidence of it;
but I do not know that anything else gave us so vivid a sense of the old
age of Heilbronn as those footworn grooves in the paving-stones.</p>
