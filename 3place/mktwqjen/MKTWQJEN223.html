<h4 id="chapter-v.">CHAPTER V.</h4>
<p>THE FRIGHTFUL CATASTROPHE.</p>
<p>The trial was at hand. All the great lords and barons of Brandenburgh
were assembled in the Hall of Justice in the ducal palace. No space was
left unoccupied where there was room for a spectator to stand or sit.
Conrad, clad in purple and ermine, sat in the premier’s chair, and on
either side sat the great judges of the realm. The old Duke had sternly
commanded that the trial of his daughter should proceed, without favor,
and then had taken to his bed broken-hearted. His days were numbered.
Poor Conrad had begged, as for his very life, that he might be spared
the misery of sitting in judgment upon his cousin’s crime, but it did
not avail.</p>
<p>The saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in Conrad’s
breast.</p>
<p>The gladdest was in his father’s. For, unknown to his daughter
“Conrad,“ the old Baron Klugenstein was come, and was among the crowd of
nobles, triumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house.</p>
<p>After the heralds had made due proclamation and the other
preliminaries had followed, the venerable Lord Chief justice said:</p>
<p>“Prisoner, stand forth!“</p>
<p>The unhappy princess rose and stood unveiled before the vast
multitude. The Lord Chief Justice continued:</p>
<p>“Most noble lady, before the great judges of this realm it hath been
charged and proven that out of holy wedlock your Grace hath given birth
unto a child; and by our ancient law the penalty is death, excepting in
one sole contingency, whereof his Grace the acting Duke, our good Lord
Conrad, will advertise you in his solemn sentence now; wherefore, give
heed.“</p>
<p>Conrad stretched forth the reluctant sceptre, and in the self-same
moment the womanly heart beneath his robe yearned pityingly toward the
doomed prisoner, and the tears came into his eyes. He opened his lips to
speak, but the Lord Chief Justice said quickly:</p>
<p>“Not there, your Grace, not there! It is not lawful to pronounce
judgment upon any of the ducal line SAVE FROM THE DUCAL THRONE!“</p>
<p>A shudder went to the heart of poor Conrad, and a tremor shook the
iron frame of his old father likewise. CONRAD HAD NOT BEEN CROWNED–dared
he profane the throne? He hesitated and turned pale with fear. But it
must be done. Wondering eyes were already upon him. They would be
suspicious eyes if he hesitated longer. He ascended the throne.
Presently he stretched forth the sceptre again, and said:</p>
<p>“Prisoner, in the name of our sovereign lord, Ulrich, Duke of
Brandenburgh, I proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon me.
Give heed to my words. By the ancient law of the land, except you
produce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner,
you must surely die. Embrace this opportunity–save yourself while yet
you may. Name the father of your child!“</p>
<p>A solemn hush fell upon the great court–a silence so profound that
men could hear their own hearts beat. Then the princess slowly turned,
with eyes gleaming with hate, and pointing her finger straight at
Conrad, said:</p>
<p>“Thou art the man!“</p>
<p>An appalling conviction of his helpless, hopeless peril struck a
chill to Conrad’s heart like the chill of death itself. What power on
earth could save him! To disprove the charge, he must reveal that he was
a woman; and for an uncrowned woman to sit in the ducal chair was death!
At one and the same moment, he and his grim old father swooned and fell
to, the ground.</p>
<p>[The remainder of this thrilling and eventful story will NOT be found
in this or any other publication, either now or at any future time.]</p>
<p>The truth is, I have got my hero (or heroine) into such a
particularly close place, that I do not see how I am ever going to get
him (or her) out of it again–and therefore I will wash my hands of the
whole business, and leave that person to get out the best way that
offers–or else stay there. I thought it was going to be easy enough to
straighten out that little difficulty, but it looks different now.</p>
<h2 id="petition-concerning-copyright">PETITION CONCERNING
COPYRIGHT</h2>
<p>TO THE HONORABLE THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN CONGRESS
ASSEMBLED:</p>
<p>Whereas, The Constitution guarantees equal rights to all, backed by
the Declaration of Independence; and</p>
<p>Whereas, Under our laws, the right of property in real estate is
perpetual; and</p>
<p>Whereas, Under our laws, the right of property in the literary result
of a citizen’s intellectual labor is restricted to forty-two years;
and</p>
<p>Whereas, Forty-two years seems an exceedingly just and righteous
term, and a sufficiently long one for the retention of property;</p>
<p>Therefore, Your petitioner, having the good of his country solely at
heart, humbly prays that “equal rights“ and fair and equal treatment may
be meted out to all citizens, by the restriction of rights in all
property, real estate included, to the beneficent term of forty-two
years. Then shall all men bless your honorable body and be happy. And
for this will your petitioner ever pray. MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>A PARAGRAPH NOT ADDED TO THE PETITION</p>
<p>The charming absurdity of restricting property-rights in books to
forty-two years sticks prominently out in the fact that hardly any man’s
books ever live forty-two years, or even the half of it; and so, for the
sake of getting a shabby advantage of the heirs of about one Scott or
Burns or Milton in a hundred years, the lawmakers of the “Great“
Republic are content to leave that poor little pilfering edict upon the
statute-books. It is like an emperor lying in wait to rob a Phenix’s
nest, and waiting the necessary century to get the chance.</p>
<h2 id="after-dinner-speech">AFTER-DINNER SPEECH</h2>
<p>[AT A FOURTH OF JULY GATHERING, IN LONDON, OF AMERICANS]</p>
<p>MR. CHAIRMAN AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: I thank you for the compliment
which has just been tendered me, and to show my appreciation of it I
will not afflict you with many words. It is pleasant to celebrate in
this peaceful way, upon this old mother soil, the anniversary of an
experiment which was born of war with this same land so long ago, and
wrought out to a successful issue by the devotion of our ancestors. It
has taken nearly a hundred years to bring the English and Americans into
kindly and mutually appreciative relations, but I believe it has been
accomplished at last. It was a great step when the two last
misunderstandings were settled by arbitration instead of cannon. It is
another great step when England adopts our sewing-machines without
claiming the invention–as usual. It was another when they imported one
of our sleeping-cars the other day. And it warmed my heart more than I
can tell, yesterday, when I witnessed the spectacle of an Englishman
ordering an American sherry cobbler of his own free will and accord–and
not only that but with a great brain and a level head reminding the
barkeeper not to forget the strawberries. With a common origin, a common
language, a common literature, a common religion and–common drinks, what
is longer needful to the cementing of the two nations together in a
permanent bond of brotherhood?</p>
<p>This is an age of progress, and ours is a progressive land. A great
and glorious land, too–a land which has developed a Washington, a
Franklin, a William M. Tweed, a Longfellow, a Motley, a Jay Gould, a
Samuel C. Pomeroy, a recent Congress which has never had its equal (in
some respects), and a United States Army which conquered sixty Indians
in eight months by tiring them out–which is much better than uncivilized
slaughter, God knows. We have a criminal jury system which is superior
to any in the world; and its efficiency is only marred by the difficulty
of finding twelve men every day who don’t know anything and can’t read.
And I may observe that we have an insanity plea that would have saved
Cain. I think I can say,–and say with pride, that we have some
legislatures that bring higher prices than any in the world.</p>
<p>I refer with effusion to our railway system, which consents to let us
live, though it might do the opposite, being our owners. It only
destroyed three thousand and seventy lives last year by collisions, and
twenty-seven thousand two hundred and sixty by running over heedless and
unnecessary people at crossings. The companies seriously regretted the
killing of these thirty thousand people, and went so far as to pay for
some of them–voluntarily, of course, for the meanest of us would not
claim that we possess a court treacherous enough to enforce a law
against a railway company. But, thank Heaven, the railway companies are
generally disposed to do the right and kindly thing without compulsion.
I know of an instance which greatly touched me at the time. After an
accident the company sent home the remains of a dear distant old
relative of mine in a basket, with the remark, “Please state what figure
you hold him at–and return the basket.“ Now there couldn’t be anything
friendlier than that.</p>
<p>But I must not stand here and brag all night. However, you won’t mind
a body bragging a little about his country on the fourth of July. It is
a fair and legitimate time to fly the eagle. I will say only one more
word of brag–and a hopeful one. It is this. We have a form of government
which gives each man a fair chance and no favor. With us no individual
is born with a right to look down upon his neighbor and hold him in
contempt. Let such of us as are not dukes find our consolation in that.
And we may find hope for the future in the fact that as unhappy as is
the condition of our political morality to-day, England has risen up out
of a far fouler since the days when Charles I. ennobled courtesans and
all political place was a matter of bargain and sale. There is hope for
us yet.</p>
<p>[At least the above is the speech which I was going to make, but our
minister, General Schenck, presided, and after the blessing, got up and
made a great long inconceivably dull harangue, and wound up by saying
that inasmuch as speech-making did not seem to exhilarate the guests
much, all further oratory would be dispensed with during the evening,
and we could just sit and talk privately to our elbow-neighbors and have
a good sociable time. It is known that in consequence of that remark
forty-four perfected speeches died in the womb. The depression, the
gloom, the solemnity that reigned over the banquet from that time forth
will be a lasting memory with many that were there. By that one
thoughtless remark General Schenck lost forty-four of the best friends
he had in England. More than one said that night, “And this is the sort
of person that is sent to represent us in a great sister empire!“]</p>
<h2 id="lionizing-murderers">LIONIZING MURDERERS</h2>
<p>I had heard so much about the celebrated fortune-teller Madame—–,
that I went to see her yesterday. She has a dark complexion naturally,
and this effect is heightened by artificial aids which cost her nothing.
She wears curls–very black ones, and I had an impression that she gave
their native attractiveness a lift with rancid butter. She wears a
reddish check handkerchief, cast loosely around her neck, and it was
plain that her other one is slow getting back from the wash. I presume
she takes snuff. At any rate, something resembling it had lodged among
the hairs sprouting from her upper lip. I know she likes garlic–I knew
that as soon as she sighed. She looked at me searchingly for nearly a
minute, with her black eyes, and then said:</p>
<p>“It is enough. Come!“</p>
<p>She started down a very dark and dismal corridor–I stepping close
after her. Presently she stopped, and said that, as the way was so
crooked and dark, perhaps she had better get a light. But it seemed
ungallant to allow a woman to put herself to so much trouble for me, and
so I said:</p>
<p>“It is not worth while, madam. If you will heave another sigh, I
think I can follow it.“</p>
<p>So we got along all right. Arrived at her official and mysterious
den, she asked me to tell her the date of my birth, the exact hour of
that occurrence, and the color of my grandmother’s hair. I answered as
accurately as I could. Then she said:</p>
<p>“Young man, summon your fortitude–do not tremble. I am about to
reveal the past.“</p>
<p>“Information concerning the future would be, in a general way,
more–“</p>
<p>“Silence! You have had much trouble, some joy, some good fortune,
some bad. Your great grandfather was hanged.“</p>
<p>“That is a l–“</p>
<p>“Silence! Hanged sir. But it was not his fault. He could not help
it.“</p>
<p>“I am glad you do him justice.“</p>
<p>“Ah–grieve, rather, that the jury did. He was hanged. His star
crosses yours in the fourth division, fifth sphere. Consequently you
will be hanged also.“</p>
<p>“In view of this cheerful–“</p>
<p>“I must have silence. Yours was not, in the beginning, a criminal
nature, but circumstances changed it. At the age of nine you stole
sugar. At the age of fifteen you stole money. At twenty you stole
horses. At twenty-five you committed arson. At thirty, hardened in
crime, you became an editor. You are now a public lecturer. Worse things
are in store for you. You will be sent to Congress. Next, to the
penitentiary. Finally, happiness will come again–all will be well–you
will be hanged.“</p>
<p>I was now in tears. It seemed hard enough to go to Congress; but to
be hanged–this was too sad, too dreadful. The woman seemed surprised at
my grief. I told her the thoughts that were in my mind. Then she
comforted me.</p>
<p>“Why, man,“ she said, “hold up your head–you have nothing to grieve
about. Listen.</p>
<p>–[In this paragraph the fortune-teller details the exact history of
the Pike-Brown assassination case in New Hampshire, from the succoring
and saving of the stranger Pike by the Browns, to the subsequent hanging
and coffining of that treacherous miscreant. She adds nothing, invents
nothing, exaggerates nothing (see any New England paper for November,
1869). This Pike-Brown case is selected merely as a type, to illustrate
a custom that prevails, not in New Hampshire alone, but in every state
in the Union–I mean the sentimental custom of visiting, petting,
glorifying, and snuffling over murderers like this Pike, from the day
they enter the jail under sentence of death until they swing from the
gallows. The following extract from the Temple Bar (1866) reveals the
fact that this custom is not confined to the United States.–“on December
31, 1841, a man named John Johnes, a shoemaker, murdered his sweetheart,
Mary Hallam, the daughter of a respectable laborer, at Mansfield, in the
county of Nottingham. He was executed on March 23, 1842. He was a man of
unsteady habits, and gave way to violent fits of passion. The girl
declined his addresses, and he said if he did not have her no one else
should. After he had inflicted the first wound, which was not
immediately fatal, she begged for her life, but seeing him resolved,
asked for time to pray. He said that he would pray for both, and
completed the crime. The wounds were inflicted by a shoemaker’s knife,
and her throat was cut barbarously. After this he dropped on his knees
some time, and prayed God to have mercy on two unfortunate lovers. He
made no attempt to escape, and confessed the crime. After his
imprisonment he behaved in a most decorous manner; he won upon the good
opinion of the jail chaplain, and he was visited by the Bishop of
Lincoln. It does not appear that he expressed any contrition for the
crime, but seemed to pass away with triumphant certainty that he was
going to rejoin his victim in heaven. He was visited by some pious and
benevolent ladies of Nottingham, some of whom declared he was a child of
God, if ever there was one. One of the ladies sent him a while camellia
to wear at his execution.“]</p>
<p>“You will live in New Hampshire. In your sharp need and distress the
Brown family will succor you–such of them as Pike the assassin left
alive. They will be benefactors to you. When you shall have grown fat
upon their bounty, and are grateful and happy, you will desire to make
some modest return for these things, and so you will go to the house
some night and brain the whole family with an ax. You will rob the dead
bodies of your benefactors, and disburse your gains in riotous living
among the rowdies and courtesans of Boston. Then you will, be arrested,
tried, condemned to be hanged, thrown into prison. Now is your happy
day. You will be converted–you will be converted just as soon as every
effort to compass pardon, commutation, or reprieve has failed–and
then!–Why, then, every morning and every afternoon, the best and purest
young ladies of the village will assemble in your cell and sing hymns.
This will show that assassination is respectable. Then you will write a
touching letter, in which you will forgive all those recent Browns. This
will excite the public admiration. No public can withstand magnanimity.
Next, they will take you to the scaffold, with great eclat, at the head
of an imposing procession composed of clergymen, officials, citizens
generally, and young ladies walking pensively two and two, and bearing
bouquets and immortelles. You will mount the scaffold, and while the
great concourse stand uncovered in your presence, you will read your
sappy little speech which the minister has written for you. And then, in
the midst of a grand and impressive silence, they will swing you into
per–Paradise, my son. There will not be a dry eye on the ground. You
will be a hero! Not a rough there but will envy you. Not a rough there
but will resolve to emulate you. And next, a great procession will
follow you to the tomb–will weep over your remains–the young ladies will
sing again the hymns made dear by sweet associations connected with the
jail, and, as a last tribute of affection, respect, and appreciation of
your many sterling qualities, they will walk two and two around your
bier, and strew wreaths of flowers on it. And lo! you are canonized.
Think of it, son-ingrate, assassin, robber of the dead, drunken brawler
among thieves and harlots in the slums of Boston one month, and the pet
of the pure and innocent daughters of the land the next! A bloody and
hateful devil–a bewept, bewailed, and sainted martyr–all in a month!
Fool!–so noble a fortune, and yet you sit here grieving!“</p>
<p>“No, madam,“ I said, “you do me wrong, you do, indeed. I am perfectly
satisfied. I did not know before that my great-grandfather was hanged,
but it is of no consequence. He has probably ceased to bother about it
by this time–and I have not commenced yet. I confess, madam, that I do
something in the way of editing and lecturing, but the other crimes you
mention have escaped my memory. Yet I must have committed them–you would
not deceive a stranger. But let the past be as it was, and let the
future be as it may–these are nothing. I have only cared for one thing.
I have always felt that I should be hanged some day, and somehow the
thought has annoyed me considerably; but if you can only assure me that
I shall be hanged in New Hampshire–“</p>
<p>“Not a shadow of a doubt!“</p>
<p>“Bless you, my benefactress!–excuse this embrace–you have removed a
great load from my breast. To be hanged in New Hampshire is happiness
–it leaves an honored name behind a man, and introduces him at once into
the best New Hampshire society in the other world.“</p>
<p>I then took leave of the fortune-teller. But, seriously, is it well
to glorify a murderous villain on the scaffold, as Pike was glorified in
New Hampshire? Is it well to turn the penalty for a bloody crime into a
reward? Is it just to do it? Is, it safe?</p>
<h2 id="a-new-crime">A NEW CRIME</h2>
<p>LEGISLATION NEEDED</p>
<p>This country, during the last thirty or forty years, has produced
some of the most remarkable cases of insanity of which there is any
mention in history. For instance, there was the Baldwin case, in Ohio,
twenty-two years ago. Baldwin, from his boyhood up, had been of a
vindictive, malignant, quarrelsome nature. He put a boy’s eye out once,
and never was heard upon any occasion to utter a regret for it. He did
many such things. But at last he did something that was serious. He
called at a house just after dark one evening, knocked, and when the
occupant came to the door, shot him dead, and then tried to escape, but
was captured. Two days before, he had wantonly insulted a helpless
cripple, and the man he afterward took swift vengeance upon with an
assassin bullet had knocked him down. Such was the Baldwin case. The
trial was long and exciting; the community was fearfully wrought up. Men
said this spiteful, bad-hearted villain had caused grief enough in his
time, and now he should satisfy the law. But they were mistaken; Baldwin
was insane when he did the deed–they had not thought of that. By the
argument of counsel it was shown that at half past ten in the morning on
the day of the murder, Baldwin became insane, and remained so for eleven
hours and a half exactly. This just covered the case comfortably, and he
was acquitted. Thus, if an unthinking and excited community had been
listened to instead of the arguments of counsel, a poor crazy creature
would have been held to a fearful responsibility for a mere freak of
madness. Baldwin went clear, and although his relatives and friends were
naturally incensed against the community for their injurious suspicions
and remarks, they said let it go for this time, and did not prosecute.
The Baldwins were very wealthy. This same Baldwin had momentary fits of
insanity twice afterward, and on both occasions killed people he had
grudges against. And on both these occasions the circumstances of the
killing were so aggravated, and the murders so seemingly heartless and
treacherous, that if Baldwin had not been insane he would have been
hanged without the shadow of a doubt. As it was, it required all his
political and family influence to get him clear in one of the cases, and
cost him not less than ten thousand dollars to get clear in the other.
One of these men he had notoriously been threatening to kill for twelve
years. The poor creature happened, by the merest piece of ill fortune,
to come along a dark alley at the very moment that Baldwin’s insanity
came upon him, and so he was shot in the back with a gun loaded with
slugs.</p>
<p>Take the case of Lynch Hackett, of Pennsylvania. Twice, in public, he
attacked a German butcher by the name of Bemis Feldner, with a cane, and
both times Feldner whipped him with his fists. Hackett was a vain,
wealthy, violent gentleman, who held his blood and family in high
esteem, and believed that a reverent respect was due to his great
riches. He brooded over the shame of his chastisement for two weeks, and
then, in a momentary fit of insanity, armed himself to the teeth, rode
into town, waited a couple of hours until he saw Feldner coming down the
street with his wife on his arm, and then, as the couple passed the
doorway in which he had partially concealed himself, he drove a knife
into Feldner’s neck, killing him instantly. The widow caught the limp
form and eased it to the earth. Both were drenched with blood. Hackett
jocosely remarked to her that as a professional butcher’s recent wife
she could appreciate the artistic neatness of the job that left her in
condition to marry again, in case she wanted to. This remark, and
another which he made to a friend, that his position in society made the
killing of an obscure citizen simply an “eccentricity“ instead of a
crime, were shown to be evidences of insanity, and so Hackett escaped
punishment. The jury were hardly inclined to accept these as proofs at
first, inasmuch as the prisoner had never been insane before the murder,
and under the tranquilizing effect of the butchering had immediately
regained his right mind; but when the defense came to show that a third
cousin of Hackett’s wife’s stepfather was insane, and not only insane,
but had a nose the very counterpart of Hackett’s, it was plain that
insanity was hereditary in the family, and Hackett had come by it by
legitimate inheritance.</p>
<p>Of course the jury then acquitted him. But it was a merciful
providence that Mrs. H.’s people had been afflicted as shown, else
Hackett would certainly have been hanged.</p>
<p>However, it is not possible to recount all the marvelous cases of
insanity that have come under the public notice in the last thirty or
forty years. There was the Durgin case in New Jersey three years ago.
The servant girl, Bridget Durgin, at dead of night, invaded her
mistress’s bedroom and carved the lady literally to pieces with a knife.
Then she dragged the body to the middle of the floor, and beat and
banged it with chairs and such things. Next she opened the feather beds,
and strewed the contents around, saturated everything with kerosene, and
set fire to the general wreck. She now took up the young child of the
murdered woman in her blood smeared hands and walked off, through the
snow, with no shoes on, to a neighbor’s house a quarter of a mile off,
and told a string of wild, incoherent stories about some men coming and
setting fire to the house; and then she cried piteously, and without
seeming to think there was anything suggestive about the blood upon her
hands, her clothing, and the baby, volunteered the remark that she was
afraid those men had murdered her mistress! Afterward, by her own
confession and other testimony, it was proved that the mistress had
always been kind to the girl, consequently there was no revenge in the
murder; and it was also shown that the girl took nothing away from the
burning house, not even her own shoes, and consequently robbery was not
the motive.</p>
<p>Now, the reader says, “Here comes that same old plea of insanity
again.“ But the reader has deceived himself this time. No such plea was
offered in her defense. The judge sentenced her, nobody persecuted the
governor with petitions for her pardon, and she was promptly hanged.</p>
<p>There was that youth in Pennsylvania, whose curious confession was
published some years ago. It was simply a conglomeration of incoherent
drivel from beginning to end; and so was his lengthy speech on the
scaffold afterward. For a whole year he was haunted with a desire to
disfigure a certain young woman, so that no one would marry her. He did
not love her himself, and did not want to marry her, but he did not want
anybody else to do it. He would not go anywhere with her, and yet was
opposed to anybody else’s escorting her. Upon one occasion he declined
to go to a wedding with her, and when she got other company, lay in wait
for the couple by the road, intending to make them go back or kill the
escort. After spending sleepless nights over his ruling desire for a
full year, he at last attempted its execution–that is, attempted to
disfigure the young woman. It was a success. It was permanent. In trying
to shoot her cheek (as she sat at the supper-table with her parents and
brothers and sisters) in such a manner as to mar its comeliness, one of
his bullets wandered a little out of the course, and she dropped dead.
To the very last moment of his life he bewailed the ill luck that made
her move her face just at the critical moment. And so he died,
apparently about half persuaded that somehow it was chiefly her own
fault that she got killed. This idiot was hanged. The plea, of insanity
was not offered.</p>
<p>Insanity certainly is on the increase in the world, and crime is
dying out. There are no longer any murders–none worth mentioning, at any
rate. Formerly, if you killed a man, it was possible that you were
insane–but now, if you, having friends and money, kill a mate, it is
evidence that you are a lunatic. In these days, too, if a person of good
family and high social standing steals anything, they call it
kleptomania, and send him to the lunatic asylum. If a person of high
standing squanders his fortune in dissipation, and closes his career
with strychnine or a bullet, “Temporary Aberration“ is what was the
trouble with him.</p>
<p>Is not this insanity plea becoming rather common? Is it not so common
that the reader confidently expects to see it offered in every criminal
case that comes before the courts? And is it not so cheap, and so
common, and often so trivial, that the reader smiles in derision when
the newspaper mentions it?</p>
<p>And is it not curious to note how very often it wins acquittal for
the prisoner? Of late years it does not seem possible for a man to so
conduct himself, before killing another man, as not to be manifestly
insane. If he talks about the stars, he is insane. If he appears nervous
and uneasy an hour before the killing, he is insane. If he weeps over a
great grief, his friends shake their heads, and fear that he is “not
right.“ If, an hour after the murder, he seems ill at ease, preoccupied,
and excited, he is, unquestionably insane.</p>
<p>Really, what we want now, is not laws against crime, but a law
against insanity. There is where the true evil lies.</p>
<h2 id="a-curious-dream">A CURIOUS DREAM</h2>
<p>CONTAINING A MORAL</p>
<p>Night before last I had a singular dream. I seemed to be sitting on a
doorstep (in no particular city perhaps) ruminating, and the time of
night appeared to be about twelve or one o’clock. The weather was balmy
and delicious. There was no human sound in the air, not even a footstep.
There was no sound of any kind to emphasize the dead stillness, except
the occasional hollow barking of a dog in the distance and the fainter
answer of a further dog. Presently up the street I heard a bony
clack-clacking, and guessed it was the castanets of a serenading party.
In a minute more a tall skeleton, hooded, and half clad in a tattered
and moldy shroud, whose shreds were flapping about the ribby latticework
of its person, swung by me with a stately stride and disappeared in the
gray gloom of the starlight. It had a broken and worm-eaten coffin on
its shoulder and a bundle of something in its hand. I knew what the
clack-clacking was then; it was this party’s joints working together,
and his elbows knocking against his sides as he walked. I may say I was
surprised. Before I could collect my thoughts and enter upon any
speculations as to what this apparition might portend, I heard another
one coming for I recognized his clack-clack. He had two-thirds of a
coffin on his shoulder, and some foot and head boards under his arm. I
mightily wanted, to peer under his hood and speak to him, but when he
turned and smiled upon me with his cavernous sockets and his projecting
grin as he went by, I thought I would not detain him. He was hardly gone
when I heard the clacking again, and another one issued from the shadowy
half-light. This one was bending under a heavy gravestone, and dragging
a shabby coffin after him by a string. When he got to me he gave me a
steady look for a moment or two, and then rounded to and backed up to
me, saying:</p>
<p>“Ease this down for a fellow, will you?“</p>
<p>I eased the gravestone down till it rested on the ground, and in
doing so noticed that it bore the name of “John Baxter Copmanhurst,“
with “May, 1839,“ as the date of his death. Deceased sat wearily down by
me, and wiped his os frontis with his major maxillary–chiefly from
former habit I judged, for I could not see that he brought away any
perspiration.</p>
<p>“It is too bad, too bad,“ said he, drawing the remnant of the shroud
about him and leaning his jaw pensively on his hand. Then he put his
left foot up on his knee and fell to scratching his anklebone absently
with a rusty nail which he got out of his coffin.</p>
<p>“What is too bad, friend?“</p>
<p>“Oh, everything, everything. I almost wish I never had died.“</p>
<p>“You surprise me. Why do you say this? Has anything gone wrong? What
is the matter?“</p>
<p>“Matter! Look at this shroud-rags. Look at this gravestone, all
battered up. Look at that disgraceful old coffin. All a man’s property
going to ruin and destruction before his eyes, and ask him if anything
is wrong? Fire and brimstone!“</p>
<p>“Calm yourself, calm yourself,“ I said. “It is too bad–it is
certainly too bad, but then I had not supposed that you would much mind
such matters situated as you are.“</p>
<p>“Well, my dear sir, I do mind them. My pride is hurt, and my comfort
is impaired–destroyed, I might say. I will state my case–I will put it
to you in such a way that you can comprehend it, if you will let me,“
said the poor skeleton, tilting the hood of his shroud back, as if he
were clearing for action, and thus unconsciously giving himself a jaunty
and festive air very much at variance with the grave character of his
position in life–so to speak–and in prominent contrast with his
distressful mood.</p>
<p>“Proceed,“ said I.</p>
<p>“I reside in the shameful old graveyard a block or two above you
here, in this street–there, now, I just expected that cartilage would
let go! –third rib from the bottom, friend, hitch the end of it to my
spine with a string, if you have got such a thing about you, though a
bit of silver wire is a deal pleasanter, and more durable and becoming,
if one keeps it polished–to think of shredding out and going to pieces
in this way, just on account of the indifference and neglect of one’s
posterity!“–and the poor ghost grated his teeth in a way that gave me a
wrench and a shiver –for the effect is mightily increased by the absence
of muffling flesh and cuticle. “I reside in that old graveyard, and have
for these thirty years; and I tell you things are changed since I first
laid this old tired frame there, and turned over, and stretched out for
a long sleep, with a delicious sense upon me of being done with bother,
and grief, and anxiety, and doubt, and fear, forever and ever, and
listening with comfortable and increasing satisfaction to the sexton’s
work, from the startling clatter of his first spadeful on my coffin till
it dulled away to the faint patting that shaped the roof of my new
home-delicious! My! I wish you could try it to-night!“ and out of my
reverie deceased fetched me a rattling slap with a bony hand.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, thirty years ago I laid me down there, and was happy. For
it was out in the country then–out in the breezy, flowery, grand old
woods, and the lazy winds gossiped with the leaves, and the squirrels
capered over us and around us, and the creeping things visited us, and
the birds filled the tranquil solitude with music. Ah, it was worth ten
years of a man’s life to be dead then! Everything was pleasant. I was in
a good neighborhood, for all the dead people that lived near me belonged
to the best families in the city. Our posterity appeared to think the
world of us. They kept our graves in the very best condition; the fences
were always in faultless repair, head-boards were kept painted or
whitewashed, and were replaced with new ones as soon as they began to
look rusty or decayed; monuments were kept upright, railings intact and
bright, the rose-bushes and shrubbery trimmed, trained, and free from
blemish, the walks clean and smooth and graveled. But that day is gone
by. Our descendants have forgotten us. My grandson lives in a stately
house built with money made by these old hands of mine, and I sleep in a
neglected grave with invading vermin that gnaw my shroud to build them
nests withal! I and friends that lie with me founded and secured the
prosperity of this fine city, and the stately bantling of our loves
leaves us to rot in a dilapidated cemetery which neighbors curse and
strangers scoff at. See the difference between the old time and this
–for instance: Our graves are all caved in now; our head-boards have
rotted away and tumbled down; our railings reel this way and that, with
one foot in the air, after a fashion of unseemly levity; our monuments
lean wearily, and our gravestones bow their heads discouraged; there be
no adornments any more–no roses, nor shrubs, nor graveled walks, nor
anything that is a comfort to the eye; and even the paintless old board
fence that did make a show of holding us sacred from companionship with
beasts and the defilement of heedless feet, has tottered till it
overhangs the street, and only advertises the presence of our dismal
resting-place and invites yet more derision to it. And now we cannot
hide our poverty and tatters in the friendly woods, for the city has
stretched its withering arms abroad and taken us in, and all that
remains of the cheer of our old home is the cluster of lugubrious forest
trees that stand, bored and weary of a city life, with their feet in our
coffins, looking into the hazy distance and wishing they were there. I
tell you it is disgraceful!</p>
<p>“You begin to comprehend–you begin to see how it is. While our
descendants are living sumptuously on our money, right around us in the
city, we have to fight hard to keep skull and bones together. Bless you,
there isn’t a grave in our cemetery that doesn’t leak not one. Every
time it rains in the night we have to climb out and roost in the trees
and sometimes we are wakened suddenly by the chilly water trickling down
the back of our necks. Then I tell you there is a general heaving up of
old graves and kicking over of old monuments, and scampering of old
skeletons for the trees! Bless me, if you had gone along there some such
nights after twelve you might have seen as many as fifteen of us
roosting on one limb, with our joints rattling drearily and the wind
wheezing through our ribs! Many a time we have perched there for three
or four dreary hours, and then come down, stiff and chilled through and
drowsy, and borrowed each other’s skulls to bail out our graves with–if
you will glance up in my mouth now as I tilt my head back, you can see
that my head-piece is half full of old dry sediment how top-heavy and
stupid it makes me sometimes! Yes, sir, many a time if you had happened
to come along just before the dawn you’d have caught us bailing out the
graves and hanging our shrouds on the fence to dry. Why, I had an
elegant shroud stolen from there one morning–think a party by the name
of Smith took it, that resides in a plebeian graveyard over yonder–I
think so because the first time I ever saw him he hadn’t anything on but
a check shirt, and the last time I saw him, which was at a social
gathering in the new cemetery, he was the best-dressed corpse in the
company–and it is a significant fact that he left when he saw me; and
presently an old woman from here missed her coffin–she generally took it
with her when she went anywhere, because she was liable to take cold and
bring on the spasmodic rheumatism that originally killed her if she
exposed herself to the night air much. She was named Hotchkiss–Anna
Matilda Hotchkiss–you might know her? She has two upper front teeth, is
tall, but a good deal inclined to stoop, one rib on the left side gone,
has one shred of rusty hair hanging from the left side of her head, and
one little tuft just above and a little forward of her right ear, has
her underjaw wired on one side where it had worked loose, small bone of
left forearm gone–lost in a fight has a kind of swagger in her gait and
a ‘gallus’ way of going with: her arms akimbo and her nostrils in the
air has been pretty free and easy, and is all damaged and battered up
till she looks like a queensware crate in ruins–maybe you have met
her?“</p>
<p>“God forbid!“ I involuntarily ejaculated, for somehow I was not
looking for that form of question, and it caught me a little off my
guard. But I hastened to make amends for my rudeness, and say, “I simply
meant I had not had the honor–for I would not deliberately speak
discourteously of a friend of yours. You were saying that you were
robbed–and it was a shame, too–but it appears by what is left of the
shroud you have on that it was a costly one in its day. How did–“</p>
<p>A most ghastly expression began to develop among the decayed features
and shriveled integuments of my guest’s face, and I was beginning to
grow uneasy and distressed, when he told me he was only working up a
deep, sly smile, with a wink in it, to suggest that about the time he
acquired his present garment a ghost in a neighboring cemetery missed
one. This reassured me, but I begged him to confine himself to speech
thenceforth, because his facial expression was uncertain. Even with the
most elaborate care it was liable to miss fire. Smiling should
especially be avoided. What he might honestly consider a shining success
was likely to strike me in a very different light. I said I liked to see
a skeleton cheerful, even decorously playful, but I did not think
smiling was a skeleton’s best hold.</p>
<p>“Yes, friend,“ said the poor skeleton, “the facts are just as I have
given them to you. Two of these old graveyards–the one that I resided in
and one further along have been deliberately neglected by our
descendants of to-day until there is no occupying them any longer. Aside
from the osteological discomfort of it–and that is no light matter this
rainy weather–the present state of things is ruinous to property. We
have got to move or be content to see our effects wasted away and
utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>“Now, you will hardly believe it, but it is true, nevertheless, that
there isn’t a single coffin in good repair among all my acquaintance–now
that is an absolute fact. I do not refer to low people who come in a
pine box mounted on an express-wagon, but I am talking about your
high-toned, silver-mounted burial-case, your monumental sort, that
travel under black plumes at the head of a procession and have choice of
cemetery lots –I mean folks like the Jarvises, and the Bledsoes and
Burlings, and such. They are all about ruined. The most substantial
people in our set, they were. And now look at them–utterly used up and
poverty-stricken. One of the Bledsoes actually traded his monument to a
late barkeeper for some fresh shavings to put under his head. I tell you
it speaks volumes, for there is nothing a corpse takes so much pride in
as his monument. He loves to read the inscription. He comes after a
while to believe what it says himself, and then you may see him sitting
on the fence night after night enjoying it. Epitaphs are cheap, and they
do a poor chap a world of good after he is dead, especially if he had
hard luck while he was alive. I wish they were used more. Now I don’t
complain, but confidentially I do think it was a little shabby in my
descendants to give me nothing but this old slab of a gravestone–and all
the more that there isn’t a compliment on it. It used to have:</p>
<p>‘GONE TO HIS JUST REWARD’</p>
<p>on it, and I was proud when I first saw it, but by and by I noticed
that whenever an old friend of mine came along he would hook his chin on
the railing and pull a long face and read along down till he came to
that, and then he would chuckle to himself and walk off, looking
satisfied and comfortable. So I scratched it off to get rid of those
fools. But a dead man always takes a deal of pride in his monument.
Yonder goes half a dozen of the Jarvises now, with the family monument
along. And Smithers and some hired specters went by with his awhile ago.
Hello, Higgins, good-by, old friend! That’s Meredith Higgins–died in ’44
–belongs to our set in the cemetery–fine old family–great-grand mother
was an Injun–I am on the most familiar terms with him he didn’t hear me
was the reason he didn’t answer me. And I am sorry, too, because I would
have liked to introduce you. You would admire him. He is the most
disjointed, sway-backed, and generally distorted old skeleton you ever
saw, but he is full of fun. When he laughs it sounds like rasping two
stones together, and he always starts it off with a cheery screech like
raking a nail across a window-pane. Hey, Jones! That is old Columbus
Jones–shroud cost four hundred dollars entire trousseau, including
monument, twenty-seven hundred. This was in the spring of ’26. It was
enormous style for those days. Dead people came all the way from the
Alleghanies to see his things–the party that occupied the grave next to
mine remembers it well. Now do you see that individual going along with
a piece of a head-board under his arm, one leg-bone below his knee gone,
and not a thing in the world on? That is Barstow Dalhousie, and next to
Columbus Jones he was the most sumptuously outfitted person that ever
entered our cemetery. We are all leaving. We cannot tolerate the
treatment we are receiving at the hands of our descendants. They open
new cemeteries, but they leave us to our ignominy. They mend the
streets, but they never mend anything that is about us or belongs to us.
Look at that coffin of mine–yet I tell you in its day it was a piece of
furniture that would have attracted attention in any drawing-room in
this city. You may have it if you want it–I can’t afford to repair it.
Put a new bottom in her, and part of a new top, and a bit of fresh
lining along the left side, and you’ll find her about as comfortable as
any receptacle of her species you ever tried. No thanks no, don’t
mention it you have been civil to me, and I would give you all the
property I have got before I would seem ungrateful. Now this
winding-sheet is a kind of a sweet thing in its way, if you would like
to–No? Well, just as you say, but I wished to be fair and liberal
there’s nothing mean about me. Good-by, friend, I must be going. I may
have a good way to go to-night –don’t know. I only know one thing for
certain, and that is that I am on the emigrant trail now, and I’ll never
sleep in that crazy old cemetery again. I will travel till I fiend
respectable quarters, if I have to hoof it to New Jersey. All the boys
are going. It was decided in public conclave, last night, to emigrate,
and by the time the sun rises there won’t be a bone left in our old
habitations. Such cemeteries may suit my surviving friends, but they do
not suit the remains that have the honor to make these remarks. My
opinion is the general opinion. If you doubt it, go and see how the
departing ghosts upset things before they started. They were almost
riotous in their demonstrations of distaste. Hello, here are some of the
Bledsoes, and if you will give me a lift with this tombstone I guess I
will join company and jog along with them–mighty respectable old family,
the Bledsoes, and used to always come out in six-horse hearses and all
that sort of thing fifty years ago when I walked these streets in
daylight. Good-by, friend.“</p>
<p>And with his gravestone on his shoulder he joined the grisly
procession, dragging his damaged coffin after him, for notwithstanding
he pressed it upon me so earnestly, I utterly refused his hospitality. I
suppose that for as much as two hours these sad outcasts went clacking
by, laden with their dismal effects, and all that time I sat pitying
them. One or two of the youngest and least dilapidated among them
inquired about midnight trains on the railways, but the rest seemed
unacquainted with that mode of travel, and merely asked about common
public roads to various towns and cities, some of which are not on the
map now, and vanished from it and from the earth as much as thirty years
ago, and some few of them never had existed anywhere but on maps, and
private ones in real-estate agencies at that. And they asked about the
condition of the cemeteries in these towns and cities, and about the
reputation the citizens bore as to reverence for the dead.</p>
<p>This whole matter interested me deeply, and likewise compelled my
sympathy for these homeless ones. And it all seeming real, and I not
knowing it was a dream, I mentioned to one shrouded wanderer an idea
that had entered my head to publish an account of this curious and very
sorrowful exodus, but said also that I could not describe it truthfully,
and just as it occurred, without seeming to trifle with a grave subject
and exhibit an irreverence for the dead that would shock and distress
their surviving friends. But this bland and stately remnant of a former
citizen leaned him far over my gate and whispered in my ear, and
said:</p>
<p>“Do not let that disturb you. The community that can stand such
graveyards as those we are emigrating from can stand anything a body can
say about the neglected and forsaken dead that lie in them.“</p>
<p>At that very moment a cock crowed, and the weird procession vanished
and left not a shred or a bone behind. I awoke, and found myself lying
with my head out of the bed and “sagging“ downward considerably–a
position favorable to dreaming dreams with morals in them, maybe, but
not poetry.</p>
<p>NOTE.–The reader is assured that if the cemeteries in his town are
kept in good order, this Dream is not leveled at his town at all, but is
leveled particularly and venomously at the next town.</p>
<h2 id="a-true-story">A TRUE STORY</h2>
<p>REPEATED WORD FOR WORD AS I HEARD IT–[Written about 1876]</p>
<p>It was summer-time, and twilight. We were sitting on the porch of the
farmhouse, on the summit of the hill, and “Aunt Rachel“ was sitting
respectfully below our level, on the steps-for she was our Servant, and
colored. She was of mighty frame and stature; she was sixty years old,
but her eye was undimmed and her strength unabated. She was a cheerful,
hearty soul, and it was no more trouble for her to laugh than it is for
a bird to sing. She was under fire now, as usual when the day was done.
That is to say, she was being chaffed without mercy, and was enjoying
it. She would let off peal after of laughter, and then sit with her face
in her hands and shake with throes of enjoyment which she could no
longer get breath enough to express. It such a moment as this a thought
occurred to me, and I said:</p>
<p>“Aunt Rachel, how is it that you’ve lived sixty years and never had
any trouble?“</p>
<p>She stopped quaking. She paused, and there was moment of silence. She
turned her face over her shoulder toward me, and said, without even a
smile her voice:</p>
<p>“Misto C—–, is you in ’arnest?“</p>
<p>It surprised me a good deal; and it sobered my manner and my speech,
too. I said:</p>
<p>“Why, I thought–that is, I meant–why, you can’t have had any trouble.
I’ve never heard you sigh, and never seen your eye when there wasn’t a
laugh in it.“</p>
<p>She faced fairly around now, and was full earnestness.</p>
<p>“Has I had any trouble? Misto C—–, I’s gwyne to tell you, den I leave
it to you. I was bawn down ‘mongst de slaves; I knows all ’bout slavery,
’case I ben one of ’em my own se’f. Well sah, my ole man–dat’s my
husban’–he was lov an’ kind to me, jist as kind as you is to yo’ own
wife. An’ we had chil’en–seven chil’en–an’ loved dem chil’en jist de
same as you loves yo’ chil’en. Dey was black, but de Lord can’t make
chil’en so black but what dey mother loves ‘em an’ wouldn’t give ’em up,
no, not for anything dat’s in dis whole world.</p>
<p>“Well, sah, I was raised in ole Fo’ginny, but mother she was raised
in Maryland; an’ my souls she was turrible when she’d git started! My
lan! but she’d make de fur fly! When she’d git into dem tantrums, she
always had one word dat she said. She’d straighten herse’f up an’ put
her fists in her hips an’ say, ‘I want you to understan’ dat I wa’n’t
bawn in the mash to be fool’ by trash! I’s one o’ de ole Blue Hen’s
Chickens, I is!’ ‘Ca’se you see, dat’s what folks dat’s bawn in Maryland
calls deyselves, an’ dey’s proud of it. Well, dat was her word. I don’t
ever forgit it, beca’se she said it so much, an’ beca’se she said it one
day when my little Henry tore his wris’ awful, and most busted ‘is head,
right up at de top of his forehead, an’ de niggers didn’t fly aroun’
fas’ enough to ‘tend to him. An’ when dey talk’ back at her, she up an’
she says, ‘Look-a-heah!’ she says, ‘I want you niggers to understan’ dat
I wa’n’t bawn in de mash be fool’ by trash! I’s one o’ de ole Blue Hen’s
chickens, I is!’ an’ den she clar’ dat kitchen an’ bandage’ up de chile
herse’f. So I says dat word, too, when I’s riled.</p>
<p>“Well, bymeby my ole mistis say she’s broke, an she got to sell all
de niggers on de place. An’ when I heah dat dey gwyne to sell us all off
at oction in Richmon’, oh, de good gracious! I know what dat mean!“</p>
<p>Aunt Rachel had gradually risen, while she warmed to her subject, and
now she towered above us, black against the stars.</p>
<p>“Dey put chains on us an’ put us on a stan’ as high as dis
po’ch–twenty foot high–an’ all de people stood aroun’, crowds ‘an’
crowds. An’ dey’d come up dah an’ look at us all roun’, an’ squeeze our
arm, an’ make us git up an’ walk, an’ den say, Dis one too ole,’ or ‘Dis
one lame,’ or ‘Dis one don’t ’mount to much.’ An’ dey sole my ole man,
an’ took him away, an’ dey begin to sell my chil’en an’ take dem away,
an’ I begin to cry; an’ de man say, ‘Shet up yo’ damn blubberin’,’ an’
hit me on de mouf wid his han’. An’ when de las’ one was gone but my
little Henry, I grab’ him clost up to my breas’ so, an’ I ris up an’
says, ‘You sha’nt take him away,’ I says; ‘I’ll kill de man dat tetch
him!’ I says. But my little Henry whisper an’ say ‘I gwyne to run away,
an’ den I work an’ buy yo’ freedom’ Oh, bless de chile, he always so
good! But dey got him–dey got him, de men did; but I took and tear de
clo’es mos’ off of ‘em an’ beat ‘em over de head wid my chain; an’ dey
give it to me too, but I didn’t mine dat.</p>
<p>“Well, dah was my ole man gone, an’ all my chil’en, all my seven
chil’en –an’ six of ‘em I hain’t set eyes on ag’in to dis day, an’ dat’s
twenty-two year ago las’ Easter. De man dat bought me b’long’ in
Newbern, an’ he took me dah. Well, bymeby de years roll on an’ de waw
come. My marster he was a Confedrit colonel, an’ I was his family’s
cook. So when de Unions took dat town dey all run away an’ lef’ me all
by myse’f wid de other niggers in dat mons’us big house. So de big Union
officers move in dah, an’ dey ask me would I cook for dem. ‘Lord bless
you,’ says I, ‘dat what I’s for.’</p>
<p>“Dey wa’n’t no small-fry officers, mine you, de was de biggest dey
is; an’ de way dey made dem sojers mosey roun’! De Gen’l he tole me to
boss dat kitchen; an’ he say, ‘If anybody come meddlin’ wid you, you
jist make ‘em walk chalk; don’t you be afeared,’ he say; ‘you’s ’mong
frens now.’</p>
<p>“Well, I thinks to myse’f, if my little Henry ever got a chance to
run away, he’d make to de Norf, o’ course. So one day I comes in dah
whar de big officers was, in de parlor, an’ I drops a kurtchy, so, an’ I
up an’ tole ‘em ’bout my Henry, dey a-listenin’ to my troubles jist de
same as if I was white folks; an’ I says, ‘What I come for is beca’se if
he got away and got up Norf whar you gemmen comes from, you might ’a’
seen him, maybe, an’ could tell me so as I could fine him ag’in; he was
very little, an’ he had a sk-yar on his lef’ wris’ an’ at de top of his
forehead.’ Den dey look mournful, an’ de Gen’l says, ‘How long sence you
los’ him?’ an’ I say, ‘Thirteen year. Den de Gen’l say, ’He wouldn’t be
little no mo’ now–he’s a man!’</p>
<p>“I never thought o’ dat befo’! He was only dat little feller to me
yit. I never thought ‘bout him growin’ up an’ bein’ big. But I see it
den. None o’ de gemmen had run acrost him, so dey couldn’t do nothin’
for me. But all dat time, do’ I didn’t know it, my Henry was run off to
de Norf, years an’ years, an’ he was a barber, too, an’ worked for
hisse’f. An’ bymeby, when de waw come he ups an’ he says: ‘I’s done
barberin’,’ he says, ‘I’s gwyne to fine my ole mammy, less’n she’s
dead.’ So he sole out an’ went to whar dey was recruitin’, an’ hired
hisse’f out to de colonel for his servant an’ den he went all froo de
battles everywhah, huntin’ for his ole mammy; yes, indeedy, he’d hire to
fust one officer an’ den another, tell he’d ransacked de whole Souf; but
you see I didn’t know nuffin ’bout dis. How was I gwyne to know it?</p>
<p>“Well, one night we had a big sojer ball; de sojers dah at Newbern
was always havin’ balls an’ carryin’ on. Dey had ‘em in my kitchen,
heaps o’ times, ‘ca’se it was so big. Mine you, I was down on sich
doin’s; beca’se my place was wid de officers, an’ it rasp me to have dem
common sojers cavortin’ roun’ in my kitchen like dat. But I alway’ stood
aroun’ an kep’ things straight, I did; an’ sometimes dey’d git my dander
up, an’ den I’d make ’em clar dat kitchen mine I tell you!</p>
<p>“Well, one night–it was a Friday night–dey comes a whole platoon f’m
a nigger ridgment da was on guard at de house–de house was head
quarters, you know-an’ den I was jist a-bilin’ mad? I was jist
a-boomin’! I swelled aroun’, an swelled aroun’; I jist was a-itchin’ for
‘em to do somefin for to start me. An’ dey was a-waltzin’ an a dancin’!
my but dey was havin’ a time! an I jist a-swellin’ an’ a-swellin’ up!
Pooty soon, ‘long comes sich a spruce young nigger a-sailin’ down de
room wid a yaller wench roun’ de wais’; an’ roun an’ roun’ an roun’ dey
went, enough to make a body drunk to look at ‘em; an’ when dey got
abreas’ o’ me, dey went to kin’ o’ balancin’ aroun’ fust on one leg an’
den on t’other, an’ smilin’ at my big red turban, an’ makin’ fun, an’ I
ups an’ says ‘Git along wid you!–rubbage!’ De young man’s face kin’ o’
changed, all of a sudden, for ‘bout a second but den he went to smilin’
ag’in, same as he was befo’. Well, ‘bout dis time, in comes some niggers
dat played music and b’long’ to de ban’, an’ dey never could git along
widout puttin’ on airs. An de very fust air dey put on dat night, I lit
into em! Dey laughed, an’ dat made me wuss. De res’ o’ de niggers got to
laughin’, an’ den my soul alive but I was hot! My eye was jist
a-blazin’! I jist straightened myself up so–jist as I is now, plum to de
ceilin’, mos’ –an’ I digs my fists into my hips, an’ I says,
‘Look-a-heah!’ I says, ‘I want you niggers to understan’ dat I wa’n’t
bawn in de mash to be fool’ by trash! I’s one o’ de ole Blue hen’s
Chickens, I is!‘–an’ den I see dat young man stan’ a-starin’ an’ stiff,
lookin’ kin’ o’ up at de ceilin’ like he fo’got somefin, an’ couldn’t
‘member it no mo’. Well, I jist march’ on dem niggers–so, lookin’ like a
gen’l–an’ dey jist cave’ away befo’ me an’ out at de do’. An’ as dis
young man a-goin’ out, I heah him say to another nigger, ‘Jim,’ he says,
‘you go ’long an’ tell de cap’n I be on han’ ‘bout eight o’clock in de
mawnin’; dey’s somefin on my mine,’ he says; ‘I don’t sleep no mo’ dis
night. You go ‘long,’ he says, ‘an’ leave me by my own se’f.’</p>
<p>“Dis was ‘bout one o’clock in de mawnin’. Well, ‘bout seven, I was up
an’ on han’, gittin’ de officers’ breakfast. I was a-stoopin’ down by de
stove jist so, same as if yo’ foot was de stove–an’ I’d opened de stove
do’ wid my right han’–so, pushin’ it back, jist as I pushes yo’ foot
–an’ I’d jist got de pan o’ hot biscuits in my han’ an’ was ‘bout to
raise up, when I see a black face come aroun’ under mine, an’ de eyes
a-lookin’ up into mine, jist as I’s a-lookin’ up clost under yo’ face
now; an’ I jist stopped right dah, an’ never budged! jist gazed an’
gazed so; an’ de pan begin to tremble, an’ all of a sudden I knowed! De
pan drop’ on de flo’ an’ I grab his lef’ han’ an’ shove back his
sleeve–jist so, as I’s doin’ to you–an’ den I goes for his forehead an’
push de hair back so, an’ ‘Boy!’ I says, ‘if you an’t my Henry, what is
you doin’ wid dis welt on yo’ wris’ an’ dat sk-yar on yo’ forehead? De
Lord God ob heaven be praise’, I got my own ag’in!’</p>
<p>“Oh no’ Misto C—–, I hain’t had no trouble. An’ no joy!“</p>
<p>THE SIAMESE TWINS–[Written about 1868.]</p>
<p>I do not wish to write of the personal habits of these strange
creatures solely, but also of certain curious details of various kinds
concerning them, which, belonging only to their private life, have never
crept into print. Knowing the Twins intimately, I feel that I am
peculiarly well qualified for the task I have taken upon myself.</p>
<p>The Siamese Twins are naturally tender and affectionate
indisposition, and have clung to each other with singular fidelity
throughout a long and eventful life. Even as children they were
inseparable companions; and it was noticed that they always seemed to
prefer each other’s society to that of any other persons. They nearly
always played together; and, so accustomed was their mother to this
peculiarity, that, whenever both of them chanced to be lost, she usually
only hunted for one of them –satisfied that when she found that one she
would find his brother somewhere in the immediate neighborhood. And yet
these creatures were ignorant and unlettered-barbarians themselves and
the offspring of barbarians, who knew not the light of philosophy and
science. What a withering rebuke is this to our boasted civilization,
with its quarrelings, its wranglings, and its separations of
brothers!</p>
<p>As men, the Twins have not always lived in perfect accord; but still
there has always been a bond between them which made them unwilling to
go away from each other and dwell apart. They have even occupied the
same house, as a general thing, and it is believed that they have never
failed to even sleep together on any night since they were born. How
surely do the habits of a lifetime become second nature to us! The Twins
always go to bed at the same time; but Chang usually gets up about an
hour before his brother. By an understanding between themselves, Chang
does all the indoor work and Eng runs all the errands. This is because
Eng likes to go out; Chang’s habits are sedentary. However, Chang always
goes along. Eng is a Baptist, but Chang is a Roman Catholic; still, to
please his brother, Chang consented to be baptized at the same time that
Eng was, on condition that it should not “count.“ During the war they
were strong partisans, and both fought gallantly all through the great
struggle–Eng on the Union side and Chang on the Confederate. They took
each other prisoners at Seven Oaks, but the proofs of capture were so
evenly balanced in favor of each, that a general army court had to be
assembled to determine which one was properly the captor and which the
captive. The jury was unable to agree for a long time; but the vexed
question was finally decided by agreeing to consider them both
prisoners, and then exchanging them. At one time Chang was convicted of
disobedience of orders, and sentenced to ten days in the guard-house,
but Eng, in spite of all arguments, felt obliged to share his
imprisonment, notwithstanding he himself was entirely innocent; and so,
to save the blameless brother from suffering, they had to discharge both
from custody–the just reward of faithfulness.</p>
<p>Upon one occasion the brothers fell out about something, and Chang
knocked Eng down, and then tripped and fell on him, whereupon both
clinched and began to beat and gouge each other without mercy. The
bystanders interfered, and tried to separate them, but they could not do
it, and so allowed them to fight it out. In the end both were disabled,
and were carried to the hospital on one and the same shutter.</p>
<p>Their ancient habit of going always together had its drawbacks when
they reached man’s estate, and entered upon the luxury of courting. Both
fell in love with the same girl. Each tried to steal clandestine
interviews with her, but at the critical moment the other would always
turn up. By and by Eng saw, with distraction, that Chang had won the
girl’s affections; and, from that day forth, he had to bear with the
agony of being a witness to all their dainty billing and cooing. But
with a magnanimity that did him infinite credit, he succumbed to his
fate, and gave countenance and encouragement to a state of things that
bade fair to sunder his generous heart-strings. He sat from seven every
evening until two in the morning, listening to the fond foolishness of
the two lovers, and to the concussion of hundreds of squandered
kisses–for the privilege of sharing only one of which he would have
given his right hand. But he sat patiently, and waited, and gaped, and
yawned, and stretched, and longed for two o’clock to come. And he took
long walks with the lovers on moonlight evenings–sometimes traversing
ten miles, notwithstanding he was usually suffering from rheumatism. He
is an inveterate smoker; but he could not smoke on these occasions,
because the young lady was painfully sensitive to the smell of tobacco.
Eng cordially wanted them married, and done with it; but although Chang
often asked the momentous question, the young lady could not gather
sufficient courage to answer it while Eng was by. However, on one
occasion, after having walked some sixteen miles, and sat up till nearly
daylight, Eng dropped asleep, from sheer exhaustion, and then the
question was asked and answered. The lovers were married. All acquainted
with the circumstance applauded the noble brother-in-law. His unwavering
faithfulness was the theme of every tongue. He had stayed by them all
through their long and arduous courtship; and when at last they were
married, he lifted his hands above their heads, and said with impressive
unction, “Bless ye, my children, I will never desert ye!“ and he kept
his word. Fidelity like this is all too rare in this cold world.</p>
<p>By and by Eng fell in love with his sister-in-law’s sister, and
married her, and since that day they have all lived together, night and
day, in an exceeding sociability which is touching and beautiful to
behold, and is a scathing rebuke to our boasted civilization.</p>
<p>The sympathy existing between these two brothers is so close and so
refined that the feelings, the impulses, the emotions of the one are
instantly experienced by the other. When one is sick, the other is sick;
when one feels pain, the other feels it; when one is angered, the
other’s temper takes fire. We have already seen with what happy facility
they both fell in love with the same girl. Now Chang is bitterly opposed
to all forms of intemperance, on principle; but Eng is the reverse–for,
while these men’s feelings and emotions are so closely wedded, their
reasoning faculties are unfettered; their thoughts are free. Chang
belongs to the Good Templars, and is a hard–working, enthusiastic
supporter of all temperance reforms. But, to his bitter distress, every
now and then Eng gets drunk, and, of course, that makes Chang drunk too.
This unfortunate thing has been a great sorrow to Chang, for it almost
destroys his usefulness in his favorite field of effort. As sure as he
is to head a great temperance procession Eng ranges up alongside of him,
prompt to the minute, and drunk as a lord; but yet no more dismally and
hopelessly drunk than his brother, who has not tasted a drop. And so the
two begin to hoot and yell, and throw mud and bricks at the Good
Templars; and, of course, they break up the procession. It would be
manifestly wrong to punish Chang for what Eng does, and, therefore, the
Good Templars accept the untoward situation, and suffer in silence and
sorrow. They have officially and deliberately examined into the matter,
and find Chang blameless. They have taken the two brothers and filled
Chang full of warm water and sugar and Eng full of whisky, and in
twenty-five minutes it was not possible to tell which was the drunkest.
Both were as drunk as loons–and on hot whisky punches, by the smell of
their breath. Yet all the while Chang’s moral principles were unsullied,
his conscience clear; and so all just men were forced to confess that he
was not morally, but only physically, drunk. By every right and by every
moral evidence the man was strictly sober; and, therefore, it caused his
friends all the more anguish to see him shake hands with the pump and
try to wind his watch with his night-key.</p>
<p>There is a moral in these solemn warnings–or, at least, a warning in
these solemn morals; one or the other. No matter, it is somehow. Let us
heed it; let us profit by it.</p>
<p>I could say more of an instructive nature about these interesting
beings, but let what I have written suffice.</p>
<p>Having forgotten to mention it sooner, I will remark in conclusion
that the ages of the Siamese Twins are respectively fifty-one and
fifty-three years.</p>
<p>SPEECH AT THE SCOTTISH BANQUET IN LONDON–[Written about 1872.]</p>
<p>On the anniversary festival of the Scottish Corporation of London on
Monday evening, in response to the toast of “The Ladies,“ MARK TWAIN
replied. The following is his speech as reported in the London
Observer:</p>
<p>I am proud, indeed, of the distinction of being chosen to respond to
this especial toast, to ‘The Ladies,’ or to women if you please, for
that is the preferable term, perhaps; it is certainly the older, and
therefore the more entitled to reverence [Laughter.] I have noticed that
the Bible, with that plain, blunt honesty which is such a conspicuous
characteristic of the Scriptures, is always particular to never refer to
even the illustrious mother of all mankind herself as a ‘lady,’ but
speaks of her as a woman, [Laughter.] It is odd, but you will find it is
so. I am peculiarly proud of this honor, because I think that the toast
to women is one which, by right and by every rule of gallantry, should
take precedence of all others–of the army, of the navy, of even royalty
itself perhaps, though the latter is not necessary in this day and in
this land, for the reason that, tacitly, you do drink a broad general
health to all good women when you drink the health of the Queen of
England and the Princess of Wales. [Loud cheers.] I have in mind a poem
just now which is familiar to you all, familiar to everybody. And what
an inspiration that was (and how instantly the present toast recalls the
verses to all our minds) when the most noble, the most gracious, the
purest, and sweetest of all poets says:</p>
<p>“Woman! O woman!–er– Wom–“</p>
<p>[Laughter.] However, you remember the lines; and you remember how
feelingly, how daintily, how almost imperceptibly the verses raise up
before you, feature by feature, the ideal of a true and perfect woman;
and how, as you contemplate the finished marvel, your homage grows into
worship of the intellect that could create so fair a thing out of mere
breath, mere words. And you call to mind now, as I speak, how the poet,
with stern fidelity to the history of all humanity, delivers this
beautiful child of his heart and his brain over to the trials and
sorrows that must come to all, sooner or later, that abide in the earth,
and how the pathetic story culminates in that apostrophe–so wild, so
regretful, so full of mournful retrospection. The lines run thus:</p>
<p>“Alas!–alas!–a–alas! —-Alas!——–alas!“</p>
<p>–and so on. [Laughter.] I do not remember the rest; but, taken
together, it seems to me that poem is the noblest tribute to woman that
human genius has ever brought forth–[laughter]–and I feel that if I were
to talk hours I could not do my great theme completer or more graceful
justice than I have now done in simply quoting that poet’s matchless
words. [Renewed laughter.] The phases of the womanly nature are infinite
in their variety. Take any type of woman, and you shall find in it
something to respect, something to admire, something to love. And you
shall find the whole joining you heart and hand. Who was more patriotic
than Joan of Arc? Who was braver? Who has given us a grander instance of
self-sacrificing devotion? Ah! you remember, you remember well, what a
throb of pain, what a great tidal wave of grief swept over us all when
Joan of Arc fell at Waterloo. [Much laughter.] Who does not sorrow for
the loss of Sappho, the sweet singer of Israel? [Laughter.] Who among us
does not miss the gentle ministrations, the softening influences, the
humble piety of Lucretia Borgia? [Laughter.] Who can join in the
heartless libel that says woman is extravagant in dress when he can look
back and call to mind our simple and lowly mother Eve arrayed in her
modification of the Highland costume. [Roars of laughter.] Sir, women
have been soldiers, women have been painters, women have been poets. As
long as language lives the name of Cleopatra will live.</p>
<p>And, not because she conquered George III. [laughter]–but because she
wrote those divine lines:</p>
<p>“Let dogs delight to bark and bite, For God hath made them so.“</p>
<p>[More laughter.] The story of the world is adorned with the names of
illustrious ones of our own sex–some of them sons of St. Andrew, too
–Scott, Bruce, Burns, the warrior Wallace, Ben Nevis–[laughter]–the
gifted Ben Lomond, and the great new Scotchman, Ben Disraeli. [Great
laughter.] Out of the great plains of history tower whole mountain
ranges of sublime women–the Queen of Sheba, Josephine, Semiramis, Sairey
Gamp; the list is endless–[laughter]–but I will not call the mighty
roll, the names rise up in your own memories at the mere suggestion,
luminous with the glory of deeds that cannot die, hallowed by the loving
worship of the good and the true of all epochs and all climes. [Cheers.]
Suffice it for our pride and our honor that we in our day have added to
it such names as those of Grace Darling and Florence Nightingale.
[Cheers.] Woman is all that she should be-gentle, patient, long
suffering, trustful, unselfish, full of generous impulses. It is her
blessed mission to comfort the sorrowing, plead for the erring,
encourage the faint of purpose, succor the distressed, uplift the
fallen, befriend the friendless in a word, afford the healing of her
sympathies and a home in her heart for all the bruised and persecuted
children of misfortune that knock at its hospitable door. [Cheers.] And
when I say, God bless her, there is none among us who has known the
ennobling affection of a wife, or the steadfast devotion of a mother,
but in his heart will say, Amen! [Loud and prolonged cheering.]</p>
<p>–[Mr. Benjamin Disraeli, at that time Prime Minister of England, had
just been elected Lord Rector of Glasgow University, and had made a
speech which gave rise to a world of discussion.]</p>
<h2 id="a-ghost-story">A GHOST STORY</h2>
<p>I took a large room, far up Broadway, in a huge old building whose
upper stories had been wholly unoccupied for years until I came. The
place had long been given up to dust and cobwebs, to solitude and
silence. I seemed groping among the tombs and invading the privacy of
the dead, that first night I climbed up to my quarters. For the first
time in my life a superstitious dread came over me; and as I turned a
dark angle of the stairway and an invisible cobweb swung its slazy woof
in my face and clung there, I shuddered as one who had encountered a
phantom.</p>
<p>I was glad enough when I reached my room and locked out the mold and
the darkness. A cheery fire was burning in the grate, and I sat down
before it with a comforting sense of relief. For two hours I sat there,
thinking of bygone times; recalling old scenes, and summoning
half-forgotten faces out of the mists of the past; listening, in fancy,
to voices that long ago grew silent for all time, and to once familiar
songs that nobody sings now. And as my reverie softened down to a sadder
and sadder pathos, the shrieking of the winds outside softened to a
wail, the angry beating of the rain against the panes diminished to a
tranquil patter, and one by one the noises in the street subsided, until
the hurrying footsteps of the last belated straggler died away in the
distance and left no sound behind.</p>
<p>The fire had burned low. A sense of loneliness crept over me. I arose
and undressed, moving on tiptoe about the room, doing stealthily what I
had to do, as if I were environed by sleeping enemies whose slumbers it
would be fatal to break. I covered up in bed, and lay listening to the
rain and wind and the faint creaking of distant shutters, till they
lulled me to sleep.</p>
<p>I slept profoundly, but how long I do not know. All at once I found
myself awake, and filled with a shuddering expectancy. All was still.
All but my own heart–I could hear it beat. Presently the bedclothes
began to slip away slowly toward the foot of the bed, as if some one
were pulling them! I could not stir; I could not speak. Still the
blankets slipped deliberately away, till my breast was uncovered. Then
with a great effort I seized them and drew them over my head. I waited,
listened, waited. Once more that steady pull began, and once more I lay
torpid a century of dragging seconds till my breast was naked again. At
last I roused my energies and snatched the covers back to their place
and held them with a strong grip. I waited. By and by I felt a faint
tug, and took a fresh grip. The tug strengthened to a steady strain–it
grew stronger and stronger. My hold parted, and for the third time the
blankets slid away. I groaned. An answering groan came from the foot of
the bed! Beaded drops of sweat stood upon my forehead. I was more dead
than alive. Presently I heard a heavy footstep in my room–the step of an
elephant, it seemed to me–it was not like anything human. But it was
moving from me–there was relief in that. I heard it approach the door
–pass out without moving bolt or lock–and wander away among the dismal
corridors, straining the floors and joists till they creaked again as it
passed–and then silence reigned once more.</p>
<p>When my excitement had calmed, I said to myself, “This is a
dream–simply a hideous dream.“ And so I lay thinking it over until I
convinced myself that it was a dream, and then a comforting laugh
relaxed my lips and I was happy again. I got up and struck a light; and
when I found that the locks and bolts were just as I had left them,
another soothing laugh welled in my heart and rippled from my lips. I
took my pipe and lit it, and was just sitting down before the fire,
when-down went the pipe out of my nerveless fingers, the blood forsook
my cheeks, and my placid breathing was cut short with a gasp! In the
ashes on the hearth, side by side with my own bare footprint, was
another, so vast that in comparison mine was but an infant’s! Then I had
had a visitor, and the elephant tread was explained.</p>
<p>I put out the light and returned to bed, palsied with fear. I lay a
long time, peering into the darkness, and listening.–Then I heard a
grating noise overhead, like the dragging of a heavy body across the
floor; then the throwing down of the body, and the shaking of my windows
in response to the concussion. In distant parts of the building I heard
the muffled slamming of doors. I heard, at intervals, stealthy footsteps
creeping in and out among the corridors, and up and down the stairs.
Sometimes these noises approached my door, hesitated, and went away
again. I heard the clanking of chains faintly, in remote passages, and
listened while the clanking grew nearer–while it wearily climbed the
stairways, marking each move by the loose surplus of chain that fell
with an accented rattle upon each succeeding step as the goblin that
bore it advanced. I heard muttered sentences; half-uttered screams that
seemed smothered violently; and the swish of invisible garments, the
rush of invisible wings. Then I became conscious that my chamber was
invaded–that I was not alone. I heard sighs and breathings about my bed,
and mysterious whisperings. Three little spheres of soft phosphorescent
light appeared on the ceiling directly over my head, clung and glowed
there a moment, and then dropped –two of them upon my face and one upon
the pillow. They, spattered, liquidly, and felt warm. Intuition told me
they had–turned to gouts of blood as they fell–I needed no light to
satisfy myself of that. Then I saw pallid faces, dimly luminous, and
white uplifted hands, floating bodiless in the air–floating a moment and
then disappearing. The whispering ceased, and the voices and the sounds,
anal a solemn stillness followed. I waited and listened. I felt that I
must have light or die. I was weak with fear. I slowly raised myself
toward a sitting posture, and my face came in contact with a clammy
hand! All strength went from me apparently, and I fell back like a
stricken invalid. Then I heard the rustle of a garment it seemed to pass
to the door and go out.</p>
<p>When everything was still once more, I crept out of bed, sick and
feeble, and lit the gas with a hand that trembled as if it were aged
with a hundred years. The light brought some little cheer to my spirits.
I sat down and fell into a dreamy contemplation of that great footprint
in the ashes. By and by its outlines began to waver and grow dim. I
glanced up and the broad gas-flame was slowly wilting away. In the same
moment I heard that elephantine tread again. I noted its approach,
nearer and nearer, along the musty halls, and dimmer and dimmer the
light waned. The tread reached my very door and paused–the light had
dwindled to a sickly blue, and all things about me lay in a spectral
twilight. The door did not open, and yet I felt a faint gust of air fan
my cheek, and presently was conscious of a huge, cloudy presence before
me. I watched it with fascinated eyes. A pale glow stole over the Thing;
gradually its cloudy folds took shape–an arm appeared, then legs, then a
body, and last a great sad face looked out of the vapor. Stripped of its
filmy housings, naked, muscular and comely, the majestic Cardiff Giant
loomed above me!</p>
<p>All my misery vanished–for a child might know that no harm could come
with that benignant countenance. My cheerful spirits returned at once,
and in sympathy with them the gas flamed up brightly again. Never a
lonely outcast was so glad to welcome company as I was to greet the
friendly giant. I said:</p>
<p>“Why, is it nobody but you? Do you know, I have been scared to death
for the last two or three hours? I am most honestly glad to see you. I
wish I had a chair–Here, here, don’t try to sit down in that thing–“</p>
<p>But it was too late. He was in it before I could stop him and down he
went–I never saw a chair shivered so in my life.</p>
<p>“Stop, stop, you’ll ruin ev–“</p>
<p>Too late again. There was another crash, and another chair was
resolved into its original elements.</p>
<p>“Confound it, haven’t you got any judgment at’ all? Do you want to
ruin all the furniture on the place? Here, here, you petrified
fool–“</p>
<p>But it was no use. Before I could arrest him he had sat down on the
bed, and it was a melancholy ruin.</p>
<p>“Now what sort of a way is that to do? First you come lumbering about
the place bringing a legion of vagabond goblins along with you to worry
me to death, and then when I overlook an indelicacy of costume which
would not be tolerated anywhere by cultivated people except in a
respectable theater, and not even there if the nudity were of your sex,
you repay me by wrecking all the furniture you can find to sit down on.
And why will you? You damage yourself as much as you do me. You have
broken off the end of your spinal column, and littered up the floor with
chips of your hams till the place looks like a marble yard. You ought to
be ashamed of yourself–you are big enough to know better.“</p>
<p>“Well, I will not break any more furniture. But what am I to do? I
have not had a chance to sit down for a century.“ And the tears came
into his eyes.</p>
<p>“Poor devil,“ I said, “I should not have been so harsh with you. And
you are an orphan, too, no doubt. But sit down on the floor here–nothing
else can stand your weight–and besides, we cannot be sociable with you
away up there above me; I want you down where I can perch on this high
counting-house stool and gossip with you face to face.“ So he sat down
on the floor, and lit a pipe which I gave him, threw one of my red
blankets over his shoulders, inverted my sitz-bath on his head, helmet
fashion, and made himself picturesque and comfortable. Then he crossed
his ankles, while I renewed the fire, and exposed the flat, honeycombed
bottoms of his prodigious feet to the grateful warmth.</p>
<p>“What is the matter with the bottom of your feet and the back of your
legs, that they are gouged up so?“</p>
<p>“Infernal chilblains–I caught them clear up to the back of my head,
roosting out there under Newell’s farm. But I love the place; I love it
as one loves his old home. There is no peace for me like the peace I
feel when I am there.“</p>
<p>We talked along for half an hour, and then I noticed that he looked
tired, and spoke of it.</p>
<p>“Tired?“ he said. “Well, I should think so. And now I will tell you
all about it, since you have treated me so well. I am the spirit of the
Petrified Man that lies across the street there in the museum. I am the
ghost of the Cardiff Giant. I can have no rest, no peace, till they have
given that poor body burial again. Now what was the most natural thing
for me to do, to make men satisfy this wish? Terrify them into it! haunt
the place where the body lay! So I haunted the museum night after night.
I even got other spirits to help me. But it did no good, for nobody ever
came to the museum at midnight. Then it occurred to me to come over the
way and haunt this place a little. I felt that if I ever got a hearing I
must succeed, for I had the most efficient company that perdition could
furnish. Night after night we have shivered around through these
mildewed halls, dragging chains, groaning, whispering, tramping up and
down stairs, till, to tell you the truth, I am almost worn out. But when
I saw a light in your room to-night I roused my energies again and went
at it with a deal of the old freshness. But I am tired out–entirely
fagged out. Give me, I beseech you, give me some hope!“ I lit off my
perch in a burst of excitement, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>“This transcends everything! everything that ever did occur! Why you
poor blundering old fossil, you have had all your trouble for nothing
–you have been haunting a plaster cast of yourself–the real Cardiff
Giant is in Albany!–[A fact. The original fraud was ingeniously and
fraudfully duplicated, and exhibited in New York as the “only genuine“
Cardiff Giant (to the unspeakable disgust of the owners of the real
colossus) at the very same time that the latter was drawing crowds at a
museum is Albany,]–Confound it, don’t you know your own remains?“</p>
<p>I never saw such an eloquent look of shame, of pitiable humiliation,
overspread a countenance before.</p>
<p>The Petrified Man rose slowly to his feet, and said:</p>
<p>“Honestly, is that true?“</p>
<p>“As true as I am sitting here.“</p>
<p>He took the pipe from his mouth and laid it on the mantel, then stood
irresolute a moment (unconsciously, from old habit, thrusting his hands
where his pantaloons pockets should have been, and meditatively dropping
his chin on his breast); and finally said:</p>
<p>“Well-I never felt so absurd before. The Petrified Man has sold
everybody else, and now the mean fraud has ended by selling its own
ghost! My son, if there is any charity left in your heart for a poor
friendless phantom like me, don’t let this get out. Think how you would
feel if you had made such an ass of yourself.“</p>
<p>I heard his stately tramp die away, step by step down the stairs and
out into the deserted street, and felt sorry that he was gone, poor
fellow –and sorrier still that he had carried off my red blanket and my
bath-tub.</p>

<p>“Oh, George, I do love you!“</p>
<p>“Bless your dear heart, Mary, I know that–why is your father so
obdurate?“</p>
<p>“George, he means well, but art is folly to him–he only understands
groceries. He thinks you would starve me.“</p>
<p>“Confound his wisdom–it savors of inspiration. Why am I not a
money-making bowelless grocer, instead of a divinely gifted sculptor
with nothing to eat?“</p>
<p>“Do not despond, Georgy, dear–all his prejudices will fade away as
soon as you shall have acquired fifty thousand dol–“</p>
<p>“Fifty thousand demons! Child, I am in arrears for my board!“</p>
