<h4 id="chapter-iii.-a-diamond-robbery">CHAPTER III. A DIAMOND
ROBBERY</h4>
<p>FROM that time out, we was with him ’most all the time, and one or
t’other of us slept in his upper berth. He said he had been so lonesome,
and it was such a comfort to him to have company, and somebody to talk
to in his troubles. We was in a sweat to find out what his secret was,
but Tom said the best way was not to seem anxious, then likely he would
drop into it himself in one of his talks, but if we got to asking
questions he would get suspicious and shet up his shell. It turned out
just so. It warn’t no trouble to see that he WANTED to talk about it,
but always along at first he would scare away from it when he got on the
very edge of it, and go to talking about something else. The way it come
about was this: He got to asking us, kind of indifferent like, about the
passengers down on deck. We told him about them. But he warn’t
satisfied; we warn’t particular enough. He told us to describe them
better. Tom done it. At last, when Tom was describing one of the
roughest and raggedest ones, he gave a shiver and a gasp and says:</p>
<p>“Oh, lordy, that’s one of them! They’re aboard sure–I just knowed it.
I sort of hoped I had got away, but I never believed it. Go on.“</p>
<p>Presently when Tom was describing another mangy, rough deck
passenger, he give that shiver again and says:</p>
<p>“That’s him!–that’s the other one. If it would only come a good black
stormy night and I could get ashore. You see, they’ve got spies on me.
They’ve got a right to come up and buy drinks at the bar yonder forrard,
and they take that chance to bribe somebody to keep watch on me–porter
or boots or somebody. If I was to slip ashore without anybody seeing me,
they would know it inside of an hour.“</p>
<p>So then he got to wandering along, and pretty soon, sure enough, he
was telling! He was poking along through his ups and downs, and when he
come to that place he went right along. He says:</p>
<p>“It was a confidence game. We played it on a julery-shop in
St. Louis. What we was after was a couple of noble big di’monds as big
as hazel-nuts, which everybody was running to see. We was dressed up
fine, and we played it on them in broad daylight. We ordered the
di’monds sent to the hotel for us to see if we wanted to buy, and when
we was examining them we had paste counterfeits all ready, and THEM was
the things that went back to the shop when we said the water wasn’t
quite fine enough for twelve thousand dollars.“</p>
<p>“Twelve-thousand-dollars!“ Tom says. “Was they really worth all that
money, do you reckon?“</p>
<p>“Every cent of it.“</p>
<p>“And you fellows got away with them?“</p>
<p>“As easy as nothing. I don’t reckon the julery people know they’ve
been robbed yet. But it wouldn’t be good sense to stay around St. Louis,
of course, so we considered where we’d go. One was for going one way,
one another, so we throwed up, heads or tails, and the Upper Mississippi
won. We done up the di’monds in a paper and put our names on it and put
it in the keep of the hotel clerk, and told him not to ever let either
of us have it again without the others was on hand to see it done; then
we went down town, each by his own self–because I reckon maybe we all
had the same notion. I don’t know for certain, but I reckon maybe we
had.“</p>
<p>“What notion?“ Tom says.</p>
<p>“To rob the others.“</p>
<p>“What–one take everything, after all of you had helped to get
it?“</p>
<p>“Cert’nly.“</p>
<p>It disgusted Tom Sawyer, and he said it was the orneriest,
low-downest thing he ever heard of. But Jake Dunlap said it warn’t
unusual in the profession. Said when a person was in that line of
business he’d got to look out for his own intrust, there warn’t nobody
else going to do it for him. And then he went on. He says:</p>
<p>“You see, the trouble was, you couldn’t divide up two di’monds
amongst three. If there’d been three–But never mind about that, there
warn’t three. I loafed along the back streets studying and studying. And
I says to myself, I’ll hog them di’monds the first chance I get, and
I’ll have a disguise all ready, and I’ll give the boys the slip, and
when I’m safe away I’ll put it on, and then let them find me if they
can. So I got the false whiskers and the goggles and this countrified
suit of clothes, and fetched them along back in a hand-bag; and when I
was passing a shop where they sell all sorts of things, I got a glimpse
of one of my pals through the window. It was Bud Dixon. I was glad, you
bet. I says to myself, I’ll see what he buys. So I kept shady, and
watched. Now what do you reckon it was he bought?“</p>
<p>“Whiskers?“ said I.</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Goggles?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Oh, keep still, Huck Finn, can’t you, you’re only just hendering all
you can. What WAS it he bought, Jake?“</p>
<p>“You’d never guess in the world. It was only just a screwdriver–just
a wee little bit of a screwdriver.“</p>
<p>“Well, I declare! What did he want with that?“</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought. It was curious. It clean stumped me. I says
to myself, what can he want with that thing? Well, when he come out I
stood back out of sight, and then tracked him to a second-hand slop-shop
and see him buy a red flannel shirt and some old ragged clothes–just the
ones he’s got on now, as you’ve described. Then I went down to the wharf
and hid my things aboard the up-river boat that we had picked out, and
then started back and had another streak of luck. I seen our other pal
lay in HIS stock of old rusty second-handers. We got the di’monds and
went aboard the boat.</p>
<p>“But now we was up a stump, for we couldn’t go to bed. We had to set
up and watch one another. Pity, that was; pity to put that kind of a
strain on us, because there was bad blood between us from a couple of
weeks back, and we was only friends in the way of business. Bad anyway,
seeing there was only two di’monds betwixt three men. First we had
supper, and then tramped up and down the deck together smoking till most
midnight; then we went and set down in my stateroom and locked the doors
and looked in the piece of paper to see if the di’monds was all right,
then laid it on the lower berth right in full sight; and there we set,
and set, and by-and-by it got to be dreadful hard to keep awake. At last
Bud Dixon he dropped off. As soon as he was snoring a good regular gait
that was likely to last, and had his chin on his breast and looked
permanent, Hal Clayton nodded towards the di’monds and then towards the
outside door, and I understood. I reached and got the paper, and then we
stood up and waited perfectly still; Bud never stirred; I turned the key
of the outside door very soft and slow, then turned the knob the same
way, and we went tiptoeing out onto the guard, and shut the door very
soft and gentle.</p>
<p>“There warn’t nobody stirring anywhere, and the boat was slipping
along, swift and steady, through the big water in the smoky moonlight.
We never said a word, but went straight up onto the hurricane-deck and
plumb back aft, and set down on the end of the sky-light. Both of us
knowed what that meant, without having to explain to one another. Bud
Dixon would wake up and miss the swag, and would come straight for us,
for he ain’t afeard of anything or anybody, that man ain’t. He would
come, and we would heave him overboard, or get killed trying. It made me
shiver, because I ain’t as brave as some people, but if I showed the
white feather–well, I knowed better than do that. I kind of hoped the
boat would land somers, and we could skip ashore and not have to run the
risk of this row, I was so scared of Bud Dixon, but she was an
upper-river tub and there warn’t no real chance of that.</p>
<p>“Well, the time strung along and along, and that fellow never come!
Why, it strung along till dawn begun to break, and still he never come.
‘Thunder,’ I says, ‘what do you make out of this?–ain’t it suspicious?’
‘Land!’ Hal says, ‘do you reckon he’s playing us?–open the paper!’ I
done it, and by gracious there warn’t anything in it but a couple of
little pieces of loaf-sugar! THAT’S the reason he could set there and
snooze all night so comfortable. Smart? Well, I reckon! He had had them
two papers all fixed and ready, and he had put one of them in place of
t’other right under our noses.</p>
<p>“We felt pretty cheap. But the thing to do, straight off, was to make
a plan; and we done it. We would do up the paper again, just as it was,
and slip in, very elaborate and soft, and lay it on the bunk again, and
let on WE didn’t know about any trick, and hadn’t any idea he was
a-laughing at us behind them bogus snores of his’n; and we would stick
by him, and the first night we was ashore we would get him drunk and
search him, and get the di’monds; and DO for him, too, if it warn’t too
risky. If we got the swag, we’d GOT to do for him, or he would hunt us
down and do for us, sure. But I didn’t have no real hope. I knowed we
could get him drunk–he was always ready for that–but what’s the good of
it? You might search him a year and never find–Well, right there I
catched my breath and broke off my thought! For an idea went ripping
through my head that tore my brains to rags–and land, but I felt gay and
good! You see, I had had my boots off, to unswell my feet, and just then
I took up one of them to put it on, and I catched a glimpse of the
heel-bottom, and it just took my breath away. You remember about that
puzzlesome little screwdriver?“</p>
<p>“You bet I do,“ says Tom, all excited.</p>
<p>“Well, when I catched that glimpse of that boot heel, the idea that
went smashing through my head was, I know where he’s hid the di’monds!
You look at this boot heel, now. See, it’s bottomed with a steel plate,
and the plate is fastened on with little screws. Now there wasn’t a
screw about that feller anywhere but in his boot heels; so, if he needed
a screwdriver, I reckoned I knowed why.“</p>
<p>“Huck, ain’t it bully!“ says Tom.</p>
<p>“Well, I got my boots on, and we went down and slipped in and laid
the paper of sugar on the berth, and sat down soft and sheepish and went
to listening to Bud Dixon snore. Hal Clayton dropped off pretty soon,
but I didn’t; I wasn’t ever so wide awake in my life. I was spying out
from under the shade of my hat brim, searching the floor for leather. It
took me a long time, and I begun to think maybe my guess was wrong, but
at last I struck it. It laid over by the bulkhead, and was nearly the
color of the carpet. It was a little round plug about as thick as the
end of your little finger, and I says to myself there’s a di’mond in the
nest you’ve come from. Before long I spied out the plug’s mate.</p>
<p>“Think of the smartness and coolness of that blatherskite! He put up
that scheme on us and reasoned out what we would do, and we went ahead
and done it perfectly exact, like a couple of pudd’nheads. He set there
and took his own time to unscrew his heelplates and cut out his plugs
and stick in the di’monds and screw on his plates again. He allowed we
would steal the bogus swag and wait all night for him to come up and get
drownded, and by George it’s just what we done! I think it was powerful
smart.“</p>
<p>“You bet your life it was!“ says Tom, just full of admiration.</p>
