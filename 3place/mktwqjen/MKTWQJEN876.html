<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>I had been having considerable trouble with my wings. The day after I
helped the choir I made a dash or two with them, but was not lucky.
First off, I flew thirty yards, and then fouled an Irishman and brought
him down–brought us both down, in fact. Next, I had a collision with a
Bishop–and bowled him down, of course. We had some sharp words, and I
felt pretty cheap, to come banging into a grave old person like that,
with a million strangers looking on and smiling to themselves.</p>
<p>I saw I hadn’t got the hang of the steering, and so couldn’t rightly
tell where I was going to bring up when I started. I went afoot the rest
of the day, and let my wings hang. Early next morning I went to a
private place to have some practice. I got up on a pretty high rock, and
got a good start, and went swooping down, aiming for a bush a little
over three hundred yards off; but I couldn’t seem to calculate for the
wind, which was about two points abaft my beam. I could see I was going
considerable to looard of the bush, so I worked my starboard wing slow
and went ahead strong on the port one, but it wouldn’t answer; I could
see I was going to broach to, so I slowed down on both, and lit. I went
back to the rock and took another chance at it. I aimed two or three
points to starboard of the bush–yes, more than that–enough so as to make
it nearly a head-wind. I done well enough, but made pretty poor time. I
could see, plain enough, that on a head-wind, wings was a mistake. I
could see that a body could sail pretty close to the wind, but he
couldn’t go in the wind’s eye. I could see that if I wanted to go
a-visiting any distance from home, and the wind was ahead, I might have
to wait days, maybe, for a change; and I could see, too, that these
things could not be any use at all in a gale; if you tried to run before
the wind, you would make a mess of it, for there isn’t anyway to shorten
sail–like reefing, you know–you have to take it ALL in–shut your
feathers down flat to your sides. That would LAND you, of course. You
could lay to, with your head to the wind–that is the best you could do,
and right hard work you’d find it, too. If you tried any other game, you
would founder, sure.</p>
<p>I judge it was about a couple of weeks or so after this that I
dropped old Sandy McWilliams a note one day–it was a Tuesday–and asked
him to come over and take his manna and quails with me next day; and the
first thing he did when he stepped in was to twinkle his eye in a sly
way, and say,–</p>
<p>“Well, Cap, what you done with your wings?“</p>
<p>I saw in a minute that there was some sarcasm done up in that rag
somewheres, but I never let on. I only says,–</p>
<p>“Gone to the wash.“</p>
<p>“Yes,“ he says, in a dry sort of way, “they mostly go to the wash
–about this time–I’ve often noticed it. Fresh angels are powerful neat.
When do you look for ’em back?“</p>
<p>“Day after to-morrow,“ says I.</p>
<p>He winked at me, and smiled.</p>
<p>Says I,–</p>
<p>“Sandy, out with it. Come–no secrets among friends. I notice you
don’t ever wear wings–and plenty others don’t. I’ve been making an ass
of myself–is that it?“</p>
<p>“That is about the size of it. But it is no harm. We all do it at
first. It’s perfectly natural. You see, on earth we jump to such foolish
conclusions as to things up here. In the pictures we always saw the
angels with wings on–and that was all right; but we jumped to the
conclusion that that was their way of getting around –and that was all
wrong. The wings ain’t anything but a uniform, that’s all. When they are
in the field–so to speak,–they always wear them; you never see an angel
going with a message anywhere without his wings, any more than you would
see a military officer presiding at a court-martial without his uniform,
or a postman delivering letters, or a policeman walking his beat, in
plain clothes. But they ain’t to FLY with! The wings are for show, not
for use. Old experienced angels are like officers of the regular
army–they dress plain, when they are off duty. New angels are like the
militia–never shed the uniform–always fluttering and floundering around
in their wings, butting people down, flapping here, and there, and
everywhere, always imagining they are attracting the admiring eye–well,
they just think they are the very most important people in heaven. And
when you see one of them come sailing around with one wing tipped up and
t’other down, you make up your mind he is saying to himself: ‘I wish
Mary Ann in Arkansaw could see me now. I reckon she’d wish she hadn’t
shook me.’ No, they’re just for show, that’s all–only just for
show.“</p>
<p>“I judge you’ve got it about right, Sandy,“ says I.</p>
<p>“Why, look at it yourself,“ says he. “YOU ain’t built for wings –no
man is. You know what a grist of years it took you to come here from the
earth–and yet you were booming along faster than any cannon-ball could
go. Suppose you had to fly that distance with your wings–wouldn’t
eternity have been over before you got here? Certainly. Well, angels
have to go to the earth every day –millions of them–to appear in visions
to dying children and good people, you know–it’s the heft of their
business. They appear with their wings, of course, because they are on
official service, and because the dying persons wouldn’t know they were
angels if they hadn’t wings–but do you reckon they fly with them? It
stands to reason they don’t. The wings would wear out before they got
half-way; even the pin-feathers would be gone; the wing frames would be
as bare as kite sticks before the paper is pasted on. The distances in
heaven are billions of times greater; angels have to go all over heaven
every day; could they do it with their wings alone? No, indeed; they
wear the wings for style, but they travel any distance in an instant by
WISHING. The wishing-carpet of the Arabian Nights was a sensible
idea–but our earthly idea of angels flying these awful distances with
their clumsy wings was foolish.</p>
<p>“Our young saints, of both sexes, wear wings all the time–blazing red
ones, and blue and green, and gold, and variegated, and rainbowed, and
ring-streaked-and-striped ones–and nobody finds fault. It is suitable to
their time of life. The things are beautiful, and they set the young
people off. They are the most striking and lovely part of their outfit–a
halo don’t BEGIN.“</p>
<p>“Well,“ says I, “I’ve tucked mine away in the cupboard, and I allow
to let them lay there till there’s mud.“</p>
<p>“Yes–or a reception.“</p>
<p>“What’s that?“</p>
<p>“Well, you can see one to-night if you want to. There’s a barkeeper
from Jersey City going to be received.“</p>
<p>“Go on–tell me about it.“</p>
<p>“This barkeeper got converted at a Moody and Sankey meeting, in New
York, and started home on the ferry-boat, and there was a collision and
he got drowned. He is of a class that think all heaven goes wild with
joy when a particularly hard lot like him is saved; they think all
heaven turns out hosannahing to welcome them; they think there isn’t
anything talked about in the realms of the blest but their case, for
that day. This barkeeper thinks there hasn’t been such another stir here
in years, as his coming is going to raise. –And I’ve always noticed this
peculiarity about a dead barkeeper–he not only expects all hands to turn
out when he arrives, but he expects to be received with a torchlight
procession.“</p>
<p>“I reckon he is disappointed, then.“</p>
<p>“No, he isn’t. No man is allowed to be disappointed here. Whatever he
wants, when he comes–that is, any reasonable and unsacrilegious thing–he
can have. There’s always a few millions or billions of young folks
around who don’t want any better entertainment than to fill up their
lungs and swarm out with their torches and have a high time over a
barkeeper. It tickles the barkeeper till he can’t rest, it makes a
charming lark for the young folks, it don’t do anybody any harm, it
don’t cost a rap, and it keeps up the place’s reputation for making all
comers happy and content.“</p>
<p>“Very good. I’ll be on hand and see them land the barkeeper.“</p>
<p>“It is manners to go in full dress. You want to wear your wings, you
know, and your other things.“</p>
<p>“Which ones?“</p>
<p>“Halo, and harp, and palm branch, and all that.“</p>
<p>“Well,“ says I, “I reckon I ought to be ashamed of myself, but the
fact is I left them laying around that day I resigned from the choir. I
haven’t got a rag to wear but this robe and the wings.“</p>
<p>“That’s all right. You’ll find they’ve been raked up and saved for
you. Send for them.“</p>
<p>“I’ll do it, Sandy. But what was it you was saying about
unsacrilegious things, which people expect to get, and will be
disappointed about?“</p>
<p>“Oh, there are a lot of such things that people expect and don’t get.
For instance, there’s a Brooklyn preacher by the name of Talmage, who is
laying up a considerable disappointment for himself. He says, every now
and then in his sermons, that the first thing he does when he gets to
heaven, will be to fling his arms around Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and
kiss them and weep on them. There’s millions of people down there on
earth that are promising themselves the same thing. As many as sixty
thousand people arrive here every single day, that want to run straight
to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and hug them and weep on them. Now mind
you, sixty thousand a day is a pretty heavy contract for those old
people. If they were a mind to allow it, they wouldn’t ever have
anything to do, year in and year out, but stand up and be hugged and
wept on thirty-two hours in the twenty-four. They would be tired out and
as wet as muskrats all the time. What would heaven be, to THEM? It would
be a mighty good place to get out of–you know that, yourself. Those are
kind and gentle old Jews, but they ain’t any fonder of kissing the
emotional highlights of Brooklyn than you be. You mark my words,
Mr. T.’s endearments are going to be declined, with thanks. There are
limits to the privileges of the elect, even in heaven. Why, if Adam was
to show himself to every new comer that wants to call and gaze at him
and strike him for his autograph, he would never have time to do
anything else but just that. Talmage has said he is going to give Adam
some of his attentions, as well as A., I. and J. But he will have to
change his mind about that.“</p>
<p>“Do you think Talmage will really come here?“</p>
<p>“Why, certainly, he will; but don’t you be alarmed; he will run with
his own kind, and there’s plenty of them. That is the main charm of
heaven–there’s all kinds here–which wouldn’t be the case if you let the
preachers tell it. Anybody can find the sort he prefers, here, and he
just lets the others alone, and they let him alone. When the Deity
builds a heaven, it is built right, and on a liberal plan.“</p>
<p>Sandy sent home for his things, and I sent for mine, and about nine
in the evening we begun to dress. Sandy says,–</p>
<p>“This is going to be a grand time for you, Stormy. Like as not some
of the patriarchs will turn out.“</p>
<p>“No, but will they?“</p>
<p>“Like as not. Of course they are pretty exclusive. They hardly ever
show themselves to the common public. I believe they never turn out
except for an eleventh-hour convert. They wouldn’t do it then, only
earthly tradition makes a grand show pretty necessary on that kind of an
occasion.“</p>
<p>“Do they an turn out, Sandy?“</p>
<p>“Who?–all the patriarchs? Oh, no–hardly ever more than a couple. You
will be here fifty thousand years–maybe more–before you get a glimpse of
all the patriarchs and prophets. Since I have been here, Job has been to
the front once, and once Ham and Jeremiah both at the same time. But the
finest thing that has happened in my day was a year or so ago; that was
Charles Peace’s reception –him they called ‘the Bannercross Murderer’–an
Englishman. There were four patriarchs and two prophets on the Grand
Stand that time –there hasn’t been anything like it since Captain Kidd
came; Abel was there–the first time in twelve hundred years. A report
got around that Adam was coming; well, of course, Abel was enough to
bring a crowd, all by himself, but there is nobody that can draw like
Adam. It was a false report, but it got around, anyway, as I say, and it
will be a long day before I see the like of it again. The reception was
in the English department, of course, which is eight hundred and eleven
million miles from the New Jersey line. I went, along with a good many
of my neighbors, and it was a sight to see, I can tell you. Flocks came
from all the departments. I saw Esquimaux there, and Tartars, Negroes,
Chinamen–people from everywhere. You see a mixture like that in the
Grand Choir, the first day you land here, but you hardly ever see it
again. There were billions of people; when they were singing or
hosannahing, the noise was wonderful; and even when their tongues were
still the drumming of the wings was nearly enough to burst your head,
for all the sky was as thick as if it was snowing angels. Although Adam
was not there, it was a great time anyway, because we had three
archangels on the Grand Stand–it is a seldom thing that even one comes
out.“</p>
<p>“What did they look like, Sandy?“</p>
<p>“Well, they had shining faces, and shining robes, and wonderful
rainbow wings, and they stood eighteen feet high, and wore swords, and
held their heads up in a noble way, and looked like soldiers.“</p>
<p>“Did they have halos?“</p>
<p>“No–anyway, not the hoop kind. The archangels and the upper-class
patriarchs wear a finer thing than that. It is a round, solid, splendid
glory of gold, that is blinding to look at. You have often seen a
patriarch in a picture, on earth, with that thing on –you remember
it?–he looks as if he had his head in a brass platter. That don’t give
you the right idea of it at all–it is much more shining and
beautiful.“</p>
<p>“Did you talk with those archangels and patriarchs, Sandy?“</p>
<p>“Who–<em>I</em>? Why, what can you be thinking about, Stormy? I ain’t
worthy to speak to such as they.“</p>
<p>“Is Talmage?“</p>
<p>“Of course not. You have got the same mixed-up idea about these
things that everybody has down there. I had it once, but I got over it.
Down there they talk of the heavenly King–and that is right–but then
they go right on speaking as if this was a republic and everybody was on
a dead level with everybody else, and privileged to fling his arms
around anybody he comes across, and be hail-fellow-well-met with all the
elect, from the highest down. How tangled up and absurd that is! How are
you going to have a republic under a king? How are you going to have a
republic at all, where the head of the government is absolute, holds his
place forever, and has no parliament, no council to meddle or make in
his affairs, nobody voted for, nobody elected, nobody in the whole
universe with a voice in the government, nobody asked to take a hand in
its matters, and nobody ALLOWED to do it? Fine republic, ain’t it?“</p>
<p>“Well, yes–it IS a little different from the idea I had–but I thought
I might go around and get acquainted with the grandees, anyway–not
exactly splice the main-brace with them, you know, but shake hands and
pass the time of day.“</p>
<p>“Could Tom, Dick and Harry call on the Cabinet of Russia and do
that?–on Prince Gortschakoff, for instance?“</p>
<p>“I reckon not, Sandy.“</p>
<p>“Well, this is Russia–only more so. There’s not the shadow of a
republic about it anywhere. There are ranks, here. There are viceroys,
princes, governors, sub-governors, sub-sub-governors, and a hundred
orders of nobility, grading along down from grand-ducal archangels,
stage by stage, till the general level is struck, where there ain’t any
titles. Do you know what a prince of the blood is, on earth?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Well, a prince of the blood don’t belong to the royal family
exactly, and he don’t belong to the mere nobility of the kingdom; he is
lower than the one, and higher than t’other. That’s about the position
of the patriarchs and prophets here. There’s some mighty high nobility
here–people that you and I ain’t worthy to polish sandals for–and THEY
ain’t worthy to polish sandals for the patriarchs and prophets. That
gives you a kind of an idea of their rank, don’t it? You begin to see
how high up they are, don’t you? just to get a two-minute glimpse of one
of them is a thing for a body to remember and tell about for a thousand
years. Why, Captain, just think of this: if Abraham was to set his foot
down here by this door, there would be a railing set up around that
foot-track right away, and a shelter put over it, and people would flock
here from all over heaven, for hundreds and hundreds of years, to look
at it. Abraham is one of the parties that Mr. Talmage, of Brooklyn, is
going to embrace, and kiss, and weep on, when he comes. He wants to lay
in a good stock of tears, you know, or five to one he will go dry before
he gets a chance to do it.“</p>
<p>“Sandy,“ says I, “I had an idea that <em>I</em> was going to be
equals with everybody here, too, but I will let that drop. It don’t
matter, and I am plenty happy enough anyway.“</p>
<p>“Captain, you are happier than you would be, the other way. These old
patriarchs and prophets have got ages the start of you; they know more
in two minutes than you know in a year. Did you ever try to have a
sociable improving-time discussing winds, and currents and variations of
compass with an undertaker?“</p>
<p>“I get your idea, Sandy. He couldn’t interest me. He would be an
ignoramus in such things–he would bore me, and I would bore him.“</p>
<p>“You have got it. You would bore the patriarchs when you talked, and
when they talked they would shoot over your head. By and by you would
say, ‘Good morning, your Eminence, I will call again’ –but you wouldn’t.
Did you ever ask the slush-boy to come up in the cabin and take dinner
with you?“</p>
<p>“I get your drift again, Sandy. I wouldn’t be used to such grand
people as the patriarchs and prophets, and I would be sheepish and
tongue-tied in their company, and mighty glad to get out of it. Sandy,
which is the highest rank, patriarch or prophet?“</p>
<p>“Oh, the prophets hold over the patriarchs. The newest prophet, even,
is of a sight more consequence than the oldest patriarch. Yes, sir, Adam
himself has to walk behind Shakespeare.“</p>
<p>“Was Shakespeare a prophet?“</p>
<p>“Of course he was; and so was Homer, and heaps more. But Shakespeare
and the rest have to walk behind a common tailor from Tennessee, by the
name of Billings; and behind a horse-doctor named Sakka, from
Afghanistan. Jeremiah, and Billings and Buddha walk together, side by
side, right behind a crowd from planets not in our astronomy; next come
a dozen or two from Jupiter and other worlds; next come Daniel, and
Sakka and Confucius; next a lot from systems outside of ours; next come
Ezekiel, and Mahomet, Zoroaster, and a knife-grinder from ancient Egypt;
then there is a long string, and after them, away down toward the
bottom, come Shakespeare and Homer, and a shoemaker named Marais, from
the back settlements of France.“</p>
<p>“Have they really rung in Mahomet and all those other heathens?“</p>
<p>“Yes–they all had their message, and they all get their reward. The
man who don’t get his reward on earth, needn’t bother–he will get it
here, sure.“</p>
<p>“But why did they throw off on Shakespeare, that way, and put him
away down there below those shoe-makers and horse-doctors and
knife-grinders–a lot of people nobody ever heard of?“</p>
<p>“That is the heavenly justice of it–they warn’t rewarded according to
their deserts, on earth, but here they get their rightful rank. That
tailor Billings, from Tennessee, wrote poetry that Homer and Shakespeare
couldn’t begin to come up to; but nobody would print it, nobody read it
but his neighbors, an ignorant lot, and they laughed at it. Whenever the
village had a drunken frolic and a dance, they would drag him in and
crown him with cabbage leaves, and pretend to bow down to him; and one
night when he was sick and nearly starved to death, they had him out and
crowned him, and then they rode him on a rail about the village, and
everybody followed along, beating tin pans and yelling. Well, he died
before morning. He wasn’t ever expecting to go to heaven, much less that
there was going to be any fuss made over him, so I reckon he was a good
deal surprised when the reception broke on him.“</p>
<p>“Was you there, Sandy?“</p>
<p>“Bless you, no!“</p>
<p>“Why? Didn’t you know it was going to come off?“</p>
<p>“Well, I judge I did. It was the talk of these realms–not for a day,
like this barkeeper business, but for twenty years before the man
died.“</p>
<p>“Why the mischief didn’t you go, then?“</p>
<p>“Now how you talk! The like of me go meddling around at the reception
of a prophet? A mudsill like me trying to push in and help receive an
awful grandee like Edward J. Billings? Why, I should have been laughed
at for a billion miles around. I shouldn’t ever heard the last of
it.“</p>
<p>“Well, who did go, then?“</p>
<p>“Mighty few people that you and I will ever get a chance to see,
Captain. Not a solitary commoner ever has the luck to see a reception of
a prophet, I can tell you. All the nobility, and all the patriarchs and
prophets–every last one of them–and all the archangels, and all the
princes and governors and viceroys, were there,–and NO small fry–not a
single one. And mind you, I’m not talking about only the grandees from
OUR world, but the princes and patriarchs and so on from ALL the worlds
that shine in our sky, and from billions more that belong in systems
upon systems away outside of the one our sun is in. There were some
prophets and patriarchs there that ours ain’t a circumstance to, for
rank and illustriousness and all that. Some were from Jupiter and other
worlds in our own system, but the most celebrated were three poets, Saa,
Bo and Soof, from great planets in three different and very remote
systems. These three names are common and familiar in every nook and
corner of heaven, clear from one end of it to the other –fully as well
known as the eighty Supreme Archangels, in fact –where as our Moses, and
Adam, and the rest, have not been heard of outside of our world’s little
corner of heaven, except by a few very learned men scattered here and
there–and they always spell their names wrong, and get the performances
of one mixed up with the doings of another, and they almost always
locate them simply IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, and think that is enough without
going into little details such as naming the particular world they are
from. It is like a learned Hindoo showing off how much he knows by
saying Longfellow lives in the United States–as if he lived all over the
United States, and as if the country was so small you couldn’t throw a
brick there without hitting him. Between you and me, it does gravel me,
the cool way people from those monster worlds outside our system snub
our little world, and even our system. Of course we think a good deal of
Jupiter, because our world is only a potato to it, for size; but then
there are worlds in other systems that Jupiter isn’t even a mustard-seed
to–like the planet Goobra, for instance, which you couldn’t squeeze
inside the orbit of Halley’s comet without straining the rivets.
Tourists from Goobra (I mean parties that lived and died there–natives)
come here, now and then, and inquire about our world, and when they find
out it is so little that a streak of lightning can flash clear around it
in the eighth of a second, they have to lean up against something to
laugh. Then they screw a glass into their eye and go to examining us, as
if we were a curious kind of foreign bug, or something of that sort. One
of them asked me how long our day was; and when I told him it was twelve
hours long, as a general thing, he asked me if people where I was from
considered it worth while to get up and wash for such a day as that.
That is the way with those Goobra people–they can’t seem to let a chance
go by to throw it in your face that their day is three hundred and
twenty-two of our years long. This young snob was just of age–he was six
or seven thousand of his days old–say two million of our years–and he
had all the puppy airs that belong to that time of life–that
turning-point when a person has got over being a boy and yet ain’t quite
a man exactly. If it had been anywhere else but in heaven, I would have
given him a piece of my mind. Well, anyway, Billings had the grandest
reception that has been seen in thousands of centuries, and I think it
will have a good effect. His name will be carried pretty far, and it
will make our system talked about, and maybe our world, too, and raise
us in the respect of the general public of heaven. Why, look
here–Shakespeare walked backwards before that tailor from Tennessee, and
scattered flowers for him to walk on, and Homer stood behind his chair
and waited on him at the banquet. Of course that didn’t go for much
THERE, amongst all those big foreigners from other systems, as they
hadn’t heard of Shakespeare or Homer either, but it would amount to
considerable down there on our little earth if they could know about it.
I wish there was something in that miserable spiritualism, so we could
send them word. That Tennessee village would set up a monument to
Billings, then, and his autograph would outsell Satan’s. Well, they had
grand times at that reception–a small-fry noble from Hoboken told me all
about it–Sir Richard Duffer, Baronet.“</p>
<p>“What, Sandy, a nobleman from Hoboken? How is that?“</p>
<p>“Easy enough. Duffer kept a sausage-shop and never saved a cent in
his life because he used to give all his spare meat to the poor, in a
quiet way. Not tramps,–no, the other sort–the sort that will starve
before they will beg–honest square people out of work. Dick used to
watch hungry-looking men and women and children, and track them home,
and find out all about them from the neighbors, and then feed them and
find them work. As nobody ever saw him give anything to anybody, he had
the reputation of being mean; he died with it, too, and everybody said
it was a good riddance; but the minute he landed here, they made him a
baronet, and the very first words Dick the sausage-maker of Hoboken
heard when he stepped upon the heavenly shore were, ‘Welcome, Sir
Richard Duffer!’ It surprised him some, because he thought he had
reasons to believe he was pointed for a warmer climate than this
one.“</p>
<p>All of a sudden the whole region fairly rocked under the crash of
eleven hundred and one thunder blasts, all let off at once, and Sandy
says,–</p>
<p>“There, that’s for the barkeep.“</p>
<p>I jumped up and says,–</p>
<p>“Then let’s be moving along, Sandy; we don’t want to miss any of this
thing, you know.“</p>
<p>“Keep your seat,“ he says; “he is only just telegraphed, that is
all.“</p>
<p>“How?“</p>
<p>“That blast only means that he has been sighted from the
signal-station. He is off Sandy Hook. The committees will go down to
meet him, now, and escort him in. There will be ceremonies and delays;
they won’t be coming up the Bay for a considerable time, yet. It is
several billion miles away, anyway.“</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> could have been a barkeeper and a hard lot just as well
as not,“ says I, remembering the lonesome way I arrived, and how there
wasn’t any committee nor anything.</p>
<p>“I notice some regret in your voice,“ says Sandy, “and it is natural
enough; but let bygones be bygones; you went according to your lights,
and it is too late now to mend the thing.“</p>
<p>“No, let it slide, Sandy, I don’t mind. But you’ve got a Sandy Hook
HERE, too, have you?“</p>
<p>“We’ve got everything here, just as it is below. All the States and
Territories of the Union, and all the kingdoms of the earth and the
islands of the sea are laid out here just as they are on the globe–all
the same shape they are down there, and all graded to the relative size,
only each State and realm and island is a good many billion times bigger
here than it is below. There goes another blast.“</p>
<p>“What is that one for?“</p>
<p>“That is only another fort answering the first one. They each fire
eleven hundred and one thunder blasts at a single dash–it is the usual
salute for an eleventh-hour guest; a hundred for each hour and an extra
one for the guest’s sex; if it was a woman we would know it by their
leaving off the extra gun.“</p>
<p>“How do we know there’s eleven hundred and one, Sandy, when they all
go off at once?–and yet we certainly do know.“</p>
<p>“Our intellects are a good deal sharpened up, here, in some ways, and
that is one of them. Numbers and sizes and distances are so great, here,
that we have to be made so we can FEEL them–our old ways of counting and
measuring and ciphering wouldn’t ever give us an idea of them, but would
only confuse us and oppress us and make our heads ache.“</p>
<p>After some more talk about this, I says: “Sandy, I notice that I
hardly ever see a white angel; where I run across one white angel, I
strike as many as a hundred million copper-colored ones–people that
can’t speak English. How is that?“</p>
<p>“Well, you will find it the same in any State or Territory of the
American corner of heaven you choose to go to. I have shot along, a
whole week on a stretch, and gone millions and millions of miles,
through perfect swarms of angels, without ever seeing a single white
one, or hearing a word I could understand. You see, America was occupied
a billion years and more, by Injuns and Aztecs, and that sort of folks,
before a white man ever set his foot in it. During the first three
hundred years after Columbus’s discovery, there wasn’t ever more than
one good lecture audience of white people, all put together, in
America–I mean the whole thing, British Possessions and all; in the
beginning of our century there were only 6,000,000 or 7,000,000–say
seven; 12,000,000 or 14,000,000 in 1825; say 23,000,000 in 1850;
40,000,000 in 1875. Our death-rate has always been 20 in 1000 per annum.
Well, 140,000 died the first year of the century; 280,000 the
twenty-fifth year; 500,000 the fiftieth year; about a million the
seventy-fifth year. Now I am going to be liberal about this thing, and
consider that fifty million whites have died in America from the
beginning up to to-day–make it sixty, if you want to; make it a hundred
million –it’s no difference about a few millions one way or t’other.
Well, now, you can see, yourself, that when you come to spread a little
dab of people like that over these hundreds of billions of miles of
American territory here in heaven, it is like scattering a ten-cent box
of homoeopathic pills over the Great Sahara and expecting to find them
again. You can’t expect us to amount to anything in heaven, and we
DON’T–now that is the simple fact, and we have got to do the best we can
with it. The learned men from other planets and other systems come here
and hang around a while, when they are touring around the Kingdom, and
then go back to their own section of heaven and write a book of travels,
and they give America about five lines in it. And what do they say about
us? They say this wilderness is populated with a scattering few hundred
thousand billions of red angels, with now and then a curiously
complected DISEASED one. You see, they think we whites and the
occasional nigger are Injuns that have been bleached out or blackened by
some leprous disease or other–for some peculiarly rascally SIN, mind
you. It is a mighty sour pill for us all, my friend–even the modestest
of us, let alone the other kind, that think they are going to be
received like a long-lost government bond, and hug Abraham into the
bargain. I haven’t asked you any of the particulars, Captain, but I
judge it goes without saying–if my experience is worth anything–that
there wasn’t much of a hooraw made over you when you arrived–now was
there?“</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it, Sandy,“ says I, coloring up a little; “I wouldn’t
have had the family see it for any amount you are a mind to name. Change
the subject, Sandy, change the subject.“</p>
<p>“Well, do you think of settling in the California department of
bliss?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I wasn’t calculating on doing anything really definite
in that direction till the family come. I thought I would just look
around, meantime, in a quiet way, and make up my mind. Besides, I know a
good many dead people, and I was calculating to hunt them up and swap a
little gossip with them about friends, and old times, and one thing or
another, and ask them how they like it here, as far as they have got. I
reckon my wife will want to camp in the California range, though,
because most all her departed will be there, and she likes to be with
folks she knows.“</p>
<p>“Don’t you let her. You see what the Jersey district of heaven is,
for whites; well, the Californian district is a thousand times worse. It
swarms with a mean kind of leather-headed mud-colored angels–and your
nearest white neighbor is likely to be a million miles away. WHAT A MAN
MOSTLY MISSES, IN HEAVEN, IS COMPANY –company of his own sort and color
and language. I have come near settling in the European part of heaven
once or twice on that account.“</p>
<p>“Well, why didn’t you, Sandy?“</p>
<p>“Oh, various reasons. For one thing, although you SEE plenty of
whites there, you can’t understand any of them, hardly, and so you go
about as hungry for talk as you do here. I like to look at a Russian or
a German or an Italian–I even like to look at a Frenchman if I ever have
the luck to catch him engaged in anything that ain’t indelicate–but
LOOKING don’t cure the hunger–what you want is talk.“</p>
<p>“Well, there’s England, Sandy–the English district of heaven.“</p>
<p>“Yes, but it is not so very much better than this end of the heavenly
domain. As long as you run across Englishmen born this side of three
hundred years ago, you are all right; but the minute you get back of
Elizabeth’s time the language begins to fog up, and the further back you
go the foggier it gets. I had some talk with one Langland and a man by
the name of Chaucer–old-time poets–but it was no use, I couldn’t quite
understand them, and they couldn’t quite understand me. I have had
letters from them since, but it is such broken English I can’t make it
out. Back of those men’s time the English are just simply foreigners,
nothing more, nothing less; they talk Danish, German, Norman French, and
sometimes a mixture of all three; back of THEM, they talk Latin, and
ancient British, Irish, and Gaelic; and then back of these come billions
and billions of pure savages that talk a gibberish that Satan himself
couldn’t understand. The fact is, where you strike one man in the
English settlements that you can understand, you wade through awful
swarms that talk something you can’t make head nor tail of. You see,
every country on earth has been overlaid so often, in the course of a
billion years, with different kinds of people and different sorts of
languages, that this sort of mongrel business was bound to be the result
in heaven.“</p>
<p>“Sandy,“ says I, “did you see a good many of the great people history
tells about?“</p>
<p>“Yes–plenty. I saw kings and all sorts of distinguished people.“</p>
<p>“Do the kings rank just as they did below?“</p>
<p>“No; a body can’t bring his rank up here with him. Divine right is a
good-enough earthly romance, but it don’t go, here. Kings drop down to
the general level as soon as they reach the realms of grace. I knew
Charles the Second very well–one of the most popular comedians in the
English section–draws first rate. There are better, of course–people
that were never heard of on earth –but Charles is making a very good
reputation indeed, and is considered a rising man. Richard the
Lion-hearted is in the prize-ring, and coming into considerable favor.
Henry the Eighth is a tragedian, and the scenes where he kills people
are done to the very life. Henry the Sixth keeps a religious-book
stand.“</p>
<p>“Did you ever see Napoleon, Sandy?“</p>
<p>“Often–sometimes in the Corsican range, sometimes in the French. He
always hunts up a conspicuous place, and goes frowning around with his
arms folded and his field-glass under his arm, looking as grand, gloomy
and peculiar as his reputation calls for, and very much bothered because
he don’t stand as high, here, for a soldier, as he expected to.“</p>
<p>“Why, who stands higher?“</p>
<p>“Oh, a LOT of people WE never heard of before–the shoemaker and
horse-doctor and knife-grinder kind, you know–clodhoppers from goodness
knows where that never handled a sword or fired a shot in their
lives–but the soldiership was in them, though they never had a chance to
show it. But here they take their right place, and Caesar and Napoleon
and Alexander have to take a back seat. The greatest military genius our
world ever produced was a brick-layer from somewhere back of Boston–died
during the Revolution–by the name of Absalom Jones. Wherever he goes,
crowds flock to see him. You see, everybody knows that if he had had a
chance he would have shown the world some generalship that would have
made all generalship before look like child’s play and ’prentice work.
But he never got a chance; he tried heaps of times to enlist as a
private, but he had lost both thumbs and a couple of front teeth, and
the recruiting sergeant wouldn’t pass him. However, as I say, everybody
knows, now, what he WOULD have been,–and so they flock by the million to
get a glimpse of him whenever they hear he is going to be anywhere.
Caesar, and Hannibal, and Alexander, and Napoleon are all on his staff,
and ever so many more great generals; but the public hardly care to look
at THEM when HE is around. Boom! There goes another salute. The
barkeeper’s off quarantine now.“</p>
<p>Sandy and I put on our things. Then we made a wish, and in a second
we were at the reception-place. We stood on the edge of the ocean of
space, and looked out over the dimness, but couldn’t make out anything.
Close by us was the Grand Stand–tier on tier of dim thrones rising up
toward the zenith. From each side of it spread away the tiers of seats
for the general public. They spread away for leagues and leagues–you
couldn’t see the ends. They were empty and still, and hadn’t a cheerful
look, but looked dreary, like a theatre before anybody comes–gas turned
down. Sandy says,–</p>
<p>“We’ll sit down here and wait. We’ll see the head of the procession
come in sight away off yonder pretty soon, now.“</p>
<p>Says I,–</p>
<p>“It’s pretty lonesome, Sandy; I reckon there’s a hitch somewheres.
Nobody but just you and me–it ain’t much of a display for the
barkeeper.“</p>
<p>“Don’t you fret, it’s all right. There’ll be one more gun-fire –then
you’ll see.“</p>
<p>In a little while we noticed a sort of a lightish flush, away off on
the horizon.</p>
<p>“Head of the torchlight procession,“ says Sandy.</p>
<p>It spread, and got lighter and brighter: soon it had a strong glare
like a locomotive headlight; it kept on getting brighter and brighter
till it was like the sun peeping above the horizon-line at sea–the big
red rays shot high up into the sky.</p>
<p>“Keep your eyes on the Grand Stand and the miles of seats–sharp!“
says Sandy, “and listen for the gun-fire.“</p>
<p>Just then it burst out, “Boom-boom-boom!“ like a million
thunderstorms in one, and made the whole heavens rock. Then there was a
sudden and awful glare of light all about us, and in that very instant
every one of the millions of seats was occupied, and as far as you could
see, in both directions, was just a solid pack of people, and the place
was all splendidly lit up! It was enough to take a body’s breath away.
Sandy says,–</p>
<p>“That is the way we do it here. No time fooled away; nobody
straggling in after the curtain’s up. Wishing is quicker work than
travelling. A quarter of a second ago these folks were millions of miles
from here. When they heard the last signal, all they had to do was to
wish, and here they are.“</p>
<p>The prodigious choir struck up,–</p>
<p>“We long to hear thy voice, To see thee face to face.“</p>
<p>It was noble music, but the uneducated chipped in and spoilt it, just
as the congregations used to do on earth.</p>
<p>The head of the procession began to pass, now, and it was a wonderful
sight. It swept along, thick and solid, five hundred thousand angels
abreast, and every angel carrying a torch and singing–the whirring
thunder of the wings made a body’s head ache. You could follow the line
of the procession back, and slanting upward into the sky, far away in a
glittering snaky rope, till it was only a faint streak in the distance.
The rush went on and on, for a long time, and at last, sure enough,
along comes the barkeeper, and then everybody rose, and a cheer went up
that made the heavens shake, I tell you! He was all smiles, and had his
halo tilted over one ear in a cocky way, and was the most
satisfied-looking saint I ever saw. While he marched up the steps of the
Grand Stand, the choir struck up,–</p>
<p>“The whole wide heaven groans, And waits to hear that voice.“</p>
<p>There were four gorgeous tents standing side by side in the place of
honor, on a broad railed platform in the centre of the Grand Stand, with
a shining guard of honor round about them. The tents had been shut up
all this time. As the barkeeper climbed along up, bowing and smiling to
everybody, and at last got to the platform, these tents were jerked up
aloft all of a sudden, and we saw four noble thrones of gold, all caked
with jewels, and in the two middle ones sat old white-whiskered men, and
in the two others a couple of the most glorious and gaudy giants, with
platter halos and beautiful armor. All the millions went down on their
knees, and stared, and looked glad, and burst out into a joyful kind of
murmurs. They said,–</p>
<p>“Two archangels!–that is splendid. Who can the others be?“</p>
<p>The archangels gave the barkeeper a stiff little military bow; the
two old men rose; one of them said, “Moses and Esau welcome thee!“ and
then all the four vanished, and the thrones were empty.</p>
<p>The barkeeper looked a little disappointed, for he was calculating to
hug those old people, I judge; but it was the gladdest and proudest
multitude you ever saw–because they had seen Moses and Esau. Everybody
was saying, “Did you see them?–I did–Esau’s side face was to me, but I
saw Moses full in the face, just as plain as I see you this minute!“</p>
<p>The procession took up the barkeeper and moved on with him again, and
the crowd broke up and scattered. As we went along home, Sandy said it
was a great success, and the barkeeper would have a right to be proud of
it forever. And he said we were in luck, too; said we might attend
receptions for forty thousand years to come, and not have a chance to
see a brace of such grand moguls as Moses and Esau. We found afterwards
that we had come near seeing another patriarch, and likewise a genuine
prophet besides, but at the last moment they sent regrets. Sandy said
there would be a monument put up there, where Moses and Esau had stood,
with the date and circumstances, and all about the whole business, and
travellers would come for thousands of years and gawk at it, and climb
over it, and scribble their names on it.</p>
