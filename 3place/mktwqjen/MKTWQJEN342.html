<h4 id="chapter-xlii-chillon-has-a-nice-roomy-dungeon">Chapter XLII
[Chillon has a Nice, Roomy Dungeon]</h4>
<p>Switzerland is simply a large, humpy, solid rock, with a thin skin of
grass stretched over it. Consequently, they do not dig graves, they
blast them out with power and fuse. They cannot afford to have large
graveyards, the grass skin is too circumscribed and too valuable. It is
all required for the support of the living.</p>
<p>The graveyard in Zermatt occupies only about one-eighth of an acre.
The graves are sunk in the living rock, and are very permanent; but
occupation of them is only temporary; the occupant can only stay till
his grave is needed by a later subject, he is removed, then, for they do
not bury one body on top of another. As I understand it, a family owns a
grave, just as it owns a house. A man dies and leaves his house to his
son–and at the same time, this dead father succeeds to his own father’s
grave. He moves out of the house and into the grave, and his predecessor
moves out of the grave and into the cellar of the chapel. I saw a black
box lying in the churchyard, with skull and cross-bones painted on it,
and was told that this was used in transferring remains to the
cellar.</p>
<p>In that cellar the bones and skulls of several hundred of former
citizens were compactly corded up. They made a pile eighteen feet long,
seven feet high, and eight feet wide. I was told that in some of the
receptacles of this kind in the Swiss villages, the skulls were all
marked, and if a man wished to find the skulls of his ancestors for
several generations back, he could do it by these marks, preserved in
the family records.</p>
<p>An English gentleman who had lived some years in this region, said it
was the cradle of compulsory education. But he said that the English
idea that compulsory education would reduce bastardy and intemperance
was an error–it has not that effect. He said there was more seduction in
the Protestant than in the Catholic cantons, because the confessional
protected the girls. I wonder why it doesn’t protect married women in
France and Spain?</p>
<p>This gentleman said that among the poorer peasants in the Valais, it
was common for the brothers in a family to cast lots to determine which
of them should have the coveted privilege of marrying, and his
brethren–doomed bachelors–heroically banded themselves together to help
support the new family.</p>
<p>We left Zermatt in a wagon–and in a rain-storm, too –for St. Nicholas
about ten o’clock one morning. Again we passed between those grass-clad
prodigious cliffs, specked with wee dwellings peeping over at us from
velvety green walls ten and twelve hundred feet high. It did not seem
possible that the imaginary chamois even could climb those precipices.
Lovers on opposite cliffs probably kiss through a spy-glass, and
correspond with a rifle.</p>
<p>In Switzerland the farmer’s plow is a wide shovel, which scrapes up
and turns over the thin earthy skin of his native rock–and there the man
of the plow is a hero. Now here, by our St. Nicholas road, was a grave,
and it had a tragic story. A plowman was skinning his farm one
morning–not the steepest part of it, but still a steep part–that is, he
was not skinning the front of his farm, but the roof of it, near the
eaves–when he absent-mindedly let go of the plow-handles to moisten his
hands, in the usual way; he lost his balance and fell out of his farm
backward; poor fellow, he never touched anything till he struck bottom,
fifteen hundred feet below. [1] We throw a halo of heroism around the
life of the soldier and the sailor, because of the deadly dangers they
are facing all the time. But we are not used to looking upon farming as
a heroic occupation. This is because we have not lived in
Switzerland.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This was on a Sunday.–M.T.</li>
</ol>
<p>From St. Nicholas we struck out for Visp–or Vispach–on foot. The
rain-storms had been at work during several days, and had done a deal of
damage in Switzerland and Savoy. We came to one place where a stream had
changed its course and plunged down a mountain in a new place, sweeping
everything before it. Two poor but precious farms by the roadside were
ruined. One was washed clear away, and the bed-rock exposed; the other
was buried out of sight under a tumbled chaos of rocks, gravel, mud, and
rubbish. The resistless might of water was well exemplified. Some
saplings which had stood in the way were bent to the ground, stripped
clean of their bark, and buried under rocky debris. The road had been
swept away, too.</p>
<p>In another place, where the road was high up on the mountain’s face,
and its outside edge protected by flimsy masonry, we frequently came
across spots where this masonry had carved off and left dangerous gaps
for mules to get over; and with still more frequency we found the
masonry slightly crumbled, and marked by mule-hoofs, thus showing that
there had been danger of an accident to somebody. When at last we came
to a badly ruptured bit of masonry, with hoof-prints evidencing a
desperate struggle to regain the lost foothold, I looked quite hopefully
over the dizzy precipice. But there was nobody down there.</p>
<p>They take exceedingly good care of their rivers in Switzerland and
other portions of Europe. They wall up both banks with slanting solid
stone masonry–so that from end to end of these rivers the banks look
like the wharves at St. Louis and other towns on the Mississippi
River.</p>
<p>It was during this walk from St. Nicholas, in the shadow of the
majestic Alps, that we came across some little children amusing
themselves in what seemed, at first, a most odd and original way–but it
wasn’t; it was in simply a natural and characteristic way. They were
roped together with a string, they had mimic alpenstocks and ice-axes,
and were climbing a meek and lowly manure-pile with a most
blood-curdling amount of care and caution. The “guide“ at the head of
the line cut imaginary steps, in a laborious and painstaking way, and
not a monkey budged till the step above was vacated. If we had waited we
should have witnessed an imaginary accident, no doubt; and we should
have heard the intrepid band hurrah when they made the summit and looked
around upon the “magnificent view,“ and seen them throw themselves down
in exhausted attitudes for a rest in that commanding situation.</p>
<p>In Nevada I used to see the children play at silver-mining. Of
course, the great thing was an accident in a mine, and there were two
“star“ parts; that of the man who fell down the mimic shaft, and that of
the daring hero who was lowered into the depths to bring him up. I knew
one small chap who always insisted on playing BOTH of these parts–and he
carried his point. He would tumble into the shaft and die, and then come
to the surface and go back after his own remains.</p>
<p>It is the smartest boy that gets the hero part everywhere; he is head
guide in Switzerland, head miner in Nevada, head bull-fighter in Spain,
etc.; but I knew a preacher’s son, seven years old, who once selected a
part for himself compared to which those just mentioned are tame and
unimpressive. Jimmy’s father stopped him from driving imaginary
horse-cars one Sunday–stopped him from playing captain of an imaginary
steamboat next Sunday–stopped him from leading an imaginary army to
battle the following Sunday–and so on. Finally the little fellow
said:</p>
<p>“I’ve tried everything, and they won’t any of them do. What CAN I
play?“</p>
<p>“I hardly know, Jimmy; but you MUST play only things that are
suitable to the Sabbath-day.“</p>
<p>Next Sunday the preacher stepped softly to a back-room door to see if
the children were rightly employed. He peeped in. A chair occupied the
middle of the room, and on the back of it hung Jimmy’s cap; one of his
little sisters took the cap down, nibbled at it, then passed it to
another small sister and said, “Eat of this fruit, for it is good.“ The
Reverend took in the situation–alas, they were playing the Expulsion
from Eden! Yet he found one little crumb of comfort. He said to himself,
“For once Jimmy has yielded the chief role–I have been wronging him, I
did not believe there was so much modesty in him; I should have expected
him to be either Adam or Eve.“ This crumb of comfort lasted but a very
little while; he glanced around and discovered Jimmy standing in an
imposing attitude in a corner, with a dark and deadly frown on his face.
What that meant was very plain–HE WAS IMPERSONATING THE DEITY! Think of
the guileless sublimity of that idea.</p>
<p>We reached Vispach at 8 P.M., only about seven hours out from
St. Nicholas. So we must have made fully a mile and a half an hour, and
it was all downhill, too, and very muddy at that. We stayed all night at
the Ho^tel de Soleil; I remember it because the landlady, the portier,
the waitress, and the chambermaid were not separate persons, but were
all contained in one neat and chipper suit of spotless muslin, and she
was the prettiest young creature I saw in all that region. She was the
landlord’s daughter. And I remember that the only native match to her I
saw in all Europe was the young daughter of the landlord of a village
inn in the Black Forest. Why don’t more people in Europe marry and keep
hotel?</p>
<p>Next morning we left with a family of English friends and went by
train to Brevet, and thence by boat across the lake to Ouchy
(Lausanne).</p>
<p>Ouchy is memorable to me, not on account of its beautiful situation
and lovely surroundings–although these would make it stick long in one’s
memory–but as the place where <em>I</em> caught the London TIMES
dropping into humor. It was NOT aware of it, though. It did not do it on
purpose. An English friend called my attention to this lapse, and cut
out the reprehensible paragraph for me. Think of encountering a grin
like this on the face of that grim journal:</p>
<p>ERRATUM.–We are requested by Reuter’s Telegram Company to correct an
erroneous announcement made in their Brisbane telegram of the 2d inst.,
published in our impression of the 5th inst., stating that “Lady Kennedy
had given birth to twins, the eldest being a son.“ The Company explain
that the message they received contained the words “Governor of
Queensland, TWINS FIRST SON.“ Being, however, subsequently informed that
Sir Arthur Kennedy was unmarried and that there must be some mistake, a
telegraphic repetition was at once demanded. It has been received today
(11th inst.) and shows that the words really telegraphed by Reuter’s
agent were “Governor Queensland TURNS FIRST SOD,“ alluding to the
Maryborough-Gympic Railway in course of construction. The words in
italics were mutilated by the telegraph in transmission from Australia,
and reaching the company in the form mentioned above gave rise to the
mistake.</p>
<p>I had always had a deep and reverent compassion for the sufferings of
the “prisoner of Chillon,“ whose story Byron had told in such moving
verse; so I took the steamer and made pilgrimage to the dungeons of the
Castle of Chillon, to see the place where poor Bonnivard endured his
dreary captivity three hundred years ago. I am glad I did that, for it
took away some of the pain I was feeling on the prisoner’s account. His
dungeon was a nice, cool, roomy place, and I cannot see why he should
have been dissatisfied with it. If he had been imprisoned in a
St. Nicholas private dwelling, where the fertilizer prevails, and the
goat sleeps with the guest, and the chickens roost on him and the cow
comes in and bothers him when he wants to muse, it would have been
another matter altogether; but he surely could not have had a very
cheerless time of it in that pretty dungeon. It has romantic
window-slits that let in generous bars of light, and it has tall, noble
columns, carved apparently from the living rock; and what is more, they
are written all over with thousands of names; some of them–like Byron’s
and Victor Hugo’s–of the first celebrity. Why didn’t he amuse himself
reading these names? Then there are the couriers and tourists–swarms of
them every day–what was to hinder him from having a good time with them?
I think Bonnivard’s sufferings have been overrated.</p>
<p>Next, we took the train and went to Martigny, on the way to Mont
Blanc. Next morning we started, about eight o’clock, on foot. We had
plenty of company, in the way of wagon-loads and mule-loads of
tourists–and dust. This scattering procession of travelers was perhaps a
mile long. The road was uphill–interminable uphill–and tolerably steep.
The weather was blisteringly hot, and the man or woman who had to sit on
a creeping mule, or in a crawling wagon, and broil in the beating sun,
was an object to be pitied. We could dodge among the bushes, and have
the relief of shade, but those people could not. They paid for a
conveyance, and to get their money’s worth they rode.</p>
<p>We went by the way of the Te^te Noir, and after we reached high
ground there was no lack of fine scenery. In one place the road was
tunneled through a shoulder of the mountain; from there one looked down
into a gorge with a rushing torrent in it, and on every hand was a
charming view of rocky buttresses and wooded heights. There was a
liberal allowance of pretty waterfalls, too, on the Te^te Noir
route.</p>
<p>About half an hour before we reached the village of Argentie`re a
vast dome of snow with the sun blazing on it drifted into view and
framed itself in a strong V-shaped gateway of the mountains, and we
recognized Mont Blanc, the “monarch of the Alps.“ With every step, after
that, this stately dome rose higher and higher into the blue sky, and at
last seemed to occupy the zenith.</p>
<p>Some of Mont Blanc’s neighbors–bare, light-brown, steeplelike
rocks–were very peculiarly shaped. Some were whittled to a sharp point,
and slightly bent at the upper end, like a lady’s finger; one monster
sugar-loaf resembled a bishop’s hat; it was too steep to hold snow on
its sides, but had some in the division.</p>
<p>While we were still on very high ground, and before the descent
toward Argentie`re began, we looked up toward a neighboring
mountain-top, and saw exquisite prismatic colors playing about some
white clouds which were so delicate as to almost resemble gossamer webs.
The faint pinks and greens were peculiarly beautiful; none of the colors
were deep, they were the lightest shades. They were bewitching
commingled. We sat down to study and enjoy this singular spectacle. The
tints remained during several minutes–fitting, changing, melting into
each other; paling almost away for a moment, then reflushing–a shifting,
restless, unstable succession of soft opaline gleams, shimmering over
that air film of white cloud, and turning it into a fabric dainty enough
to clothe an angel with.</p>
<p>By and by we perceived what those super-delicate colors, and their
continuous play and movement, reminded us of; it is what one sees in a
soap-bubble that is drifting along, catching changes of tint from the
objects it passes. A soap-bubble is the most beautiful thing, and the
most exquisite, in nature; that lovely phantom fabric in the sky was
suggestive of a soap-bubble split open, and spread out in the sun. I
wonder how much it would take to buy a soap-bubble, if there was only
one in the world? One could buy a hatful of Koh-i-Noors with the same
money, no doubt.</p>
<p>We made the tramp from Martigny to Argentie`re in eight hours. We
beat all the mules and wagons; we didn’t usually do that. We hired a
sort of open baggage-wagon for the trip down the valley to Chamonix, and
then devoted an hour to dining. This gave the driver time to get drunk.
He had a friend with him, and this friend also had had time to get
drunk.</p>
<p>When we drove off, the driver said all the tourists had arrived and
gone by while we were at dinner; “but,“ said he, impressively, “be not
disturbed by that–remain tranquil–give yourselves no uneasiness–their
dust rises far before us –rest you tranquil, leave all to me–I am the
king of drivers. Behold!“</p>
<p>Down came his whip, and away we clattered. I never had such a shaking
up in my life. The recent flooding rains had washed the road clear away
in places, but we never stopped, we never slowed down for anything. We
tore right along, over rocks, rubbish, gullies, open fields–sometimes
with one or two wheels on the ground, but generally with none. Every now
and then that calm, good-natured madman would bend a majestic look over
his shoulder at us and say, “Ah, you perceive? It is as I have said –I
am the king of drivers.“ Every time we just missed going to destruction,
he would say, with tranquil happiness, “Enjoy it, gentlemen, it is very
rare, it is very unusual –it is given to few to ride with the king of
drivers –and observe, it is as I have said, <em>I</em> am he.“</p>
<p>He spoke in French, and punctuated with hiccoughs. His friend was
French, too, but spoke in German–using the same system of punctuation,
however. The friend called himself the “Captain of Mont Blanc,“ and
wanted us to make the ascent with him. He said he had made more ascents
than any other man–forty seven–and his brother had made thirty-seven.
His brother was the best guide in the world, except himself–but he, yes,
observe him well–he was the “Captain of Mont Blanc“–that title belonged
to none other.</p>
<p>The “king“ was as good as his word–he overtook that long procession
of tourists and went by it like a hurricane. The result was that we got
choicer rooms at the hotel in Chamonix than we should have done if his
majesty had been a slower artist–or rather, if he hadn’t most
providentially got drunk before he left Argentie`re.</p>
