<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>Twelve days later.</p>
<p>Mother and child were lingering in the grip of the hideous disease.
Of hope for either there was little. The aged sisters looked white and
worn, but they would not give up their posts. Their hearts were
breaking, poor old things, but their grit was steadfast and
indestructible. All the twelve days the mother had pined for the child,
and the child for the mother, but both knew that the prayer of these
longings could not be granted. When the mother was told –on the first
day–that her disease was typhoid, she was frightened, and asked if there
was danger that Helen could have contracted it the day before, when she
was in the sick-chamber on that confession visit. Hester told her the
doctor had poo-pooed the idea. It troubled Hester to say it, although it
was true, for she had not believed the doctor; but when she saw the
mother’s joy in the news, the pain in her conscience lost something of
its force–a result which made her ashamed of the constructive deception
which she had practiced, though not ashamed enough to make her
distinctly and definitely wish she had refrained from it. From that
moment the sick woman understood that her daughter must remain away, and
she said she would reconcile herself to the separation the best she
could, for she would rather suffer death than have her child’s health
imperiled. That afternoon Helen had to take to her bed, ill. She grew
worse during the night. In the morning her mother asked after her:</p>
<p>“Is she well?“</p>
<p>Hester turned cold; she opened her lips, but the words refused to
come. The mother lay languidly looking, musing, waiting; suddenly she
turned white and gasped out:</p>
<p>“Oh, my God! what is it? is she sick?“</p>
<p>Then the poor aunt’s tortured heart rose in rebellion, and words
came:</p>
<p>“No–be comforted; she is well.“</p>
<p>The sick woman put all her happy heart in her gratitude:</p>
<p>“Thank God for those dear words! Kiss me. How I worship you for
saying them!“</p>
<p>Hester told this incident to Hannah, who received it with a rebuking
look, and said, coldly:</p>
<p>“Sister, it was a lie.“</p>
<p>Hester’s lips trembled piteously; she choked down a sob, and
said:</p>
<p>“Oh, Hannah, it was a sin, but I could not help it. I could not
endure the fright and the misery that were in her face.“</p>
<p>“No matter. It was a lie. God will hold you to account for it.“</p>
<p>“Oh, I know it, I know it,“ cried Hester, wringing her hands, “but
even if it were now, I could not help it. I know I should do it
again.“</p>
<p>“Then take my place with Helen in the morning. I will make the report
myself.“</p>
<p>Hester clung to her sister, begging and imploring.</p>
<p>“Don’t, Hannah, oh, don’t–you will kill her.“</p>
<p>“I will at least speak the truth.“</p>
<p>In the morning she had a cruel report to bear to the mother, and she
braced herself for the trial. When she returned from her mission, Hester
was waiting, pale and trembling, in the hall. She whispered:</p>
<p>“Oh, how did she take it–that poor, desolate mother?“</p>
<p>Hannah’s eyes were swimming in tears. She said:</p>
<p>“God forgive me, I told her the child was well!“</p>
<p>Hester gathered her to her heart, with a grateful “God bless you,
Hannah!“ and poured out her thankfulness in an inundation of worshiping
praises.</p>
<p>After that, the two knew the limit of their strength, and accepted
their fate. They surrendered humbly, and abandoned themselves to the
hard requirements of the situation. Daily they told the morning lie, and
confessed their sin in prayer; not asking forgiveness, as not being
worthy of it, but only wishing to make record that they realized their
wickedness and were not desiring to hide it or excuse it.</p>
<p>Daily, as the fair young idol of the house sank lower and lower, the
sorrowful old aunts painted her glowing bloom and her fresh young beauty
to the wan mother, and winced under the stabs her ecstasies of joy and
gratitude gave them.</p>
<p>In the first days, while the child had strength to hold a pencil, she
wrote fond little love-notes to her mother, in which she concealed her
illness; and these the mother read and reread through happy eyes wet
with thankful tears, and kissed them over and over again, and treasured
them as precious things under her pillow.</p>
<p>Then came a day when the strength was gone from the hand, and the
mind wandered, and the tongue babbled pathetic incoherences. this was a
sore dilemma for the poor aunts. There were no love-notes for the
mother. They did not know what to do. Hester began a carefully studied
and plausible explanation, but lost the track of it and grew confused;
suspicion began to show in the mother’s face, then alarm. Hester saw it,
recognized the imminence of the danger, and descended to the emergency,
pulling herself resolutely together and plucking victor from the open
jaws of defeat. In a placid and convincing voice she said:</p>
<p>“I thought it might distress you to know it, but Helen spent the
night at the Sloanes’. There was a little party there, and, although she
did not want to go, and you so sick, we persuaded her, she being young
and needing the innocent pastimes of youth, and we believing you would
approve. Be sure she will write the moment she comes.“</p>
<p>“How good you are, and how dear and thoughtful for us both! Approve?
Why, I thank you with all my heart. My poor little exile! Tell her I
want her to have every pleasure she can–I would not rob her of one. Only
let her keep her health, that is all I ask. Don’t let that suffer; I
could not bear it. How thankful I am that she escaped this infection–and
what a narrow risk she ran, Aunt Hester! Think of that lovely face all
dulled and burned with fever. I can’t bear the thought of it. Keep her
health. Keep her bloom! I can see her now, the dainty creature–with the
big, blue, earnest eyes; and sweet, oh, so sweet and gentle and winning!
Is she as beautiful as ever, dear Aunt Hester?“</p>
<p>“Oh, more beautiful and bright and charming than ever she was before,
if such a thing can be“–and Hester turned away and fumbled with the
medicine-bottles, to hide her shame and grief.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>After a little, both aunts were laboring upon a difficult and
baffling work in Helen’s chamber. Patiently and earnestly, with their
stiff old fingers, they were trying to forge the required note. They
made failure after failure, but they improved little by little all the
time. The pity of it all, the pathetic humor of it, there was none to
see; they themselves were unconscious of it. Often their tears fell upon
the notes and spoiled them; sometimes a single misformed word made a
note risky which could have been ventured but for that; but at last
Hannah produced one whose script was a good enough imitation of Helen’s
to pass any but a suspicious eye, and bountifully enriched it with the
petting phrases and loving nicknames that had been familiar on the
child’s lips from her nursery days. She carried it to the mother, who
took it with avidity, and kissed it, and fondled it, reading its
precious words over and over again, and dwelling with deep contentment
upon its closing paragraph:</p>
<p>“Mousie darling, if I could only see you, and kiss your eyes, and
feel your arms about me! I am so glad my practicing does not disturb
you. Get well soon. Everybody is good to me, but I am so lonesome
without you, dear mamma.“</p>
<p>“The poor child, I know just how she feels. She cannot be quite happy
without me; and I–oh, I live in the light of her eyes! Tell her she must
practice all she pleases; and, Aunt Hannah –tell her I can’t hear the
piano this far, nor hear dear voice when she sings: God knows I wish I
could. No one knows how sweet that voice is to me; and to think–some day
it will be silent! What are you crying for?“</p>
<p>“Only because–because–it was just a memory. When I came away she was
singing, ‘Loch Lomond.’ The pathos of it! It always moves me so when she
sings that.“</p>
<p>“And me, too. How heartbreakingly beautiful it is when some youthful
sorrow is brooding in her breast and she sings it for the mystic healing
it brings. . . . Aunt Hannah?“</p>
<p>“Dear Margaret?“</p>
<p>“I am very ill. Sometimes it comes over me that I shall never hear
that dear voice again.“</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t–don’t, Margaret! I can’t bear it!“</p>
<p>Margaret was moved and distressed, and said, gently:</p>
<p>“There–there–let me put my arms around you. Don’t cry. There–put your
cheek to mine. Be comforted. I wish to live. I will live if I can. Ah,
what could she do without me! . . . Does she often speak of me?–but I
know she does.“</p>
<p>“Oh, all the time–all the time!“</p>
<p>“My sweet child! She wrote the note the moment she came home?“</p>
<p>“Yes–the first moment. She would not wait to take off her
things.“</p>
<p>“I knew it. It is her dear, impulsive, affectionate way. I knew it
without asking, but I wanted to hear you say it. The petted wife knows
she is loved, but she makes her husband tell her so every day, just for
the joy of hearing it. . . . She used the pen this time. That is better;
the pencil-marks could rub out, and I should grieve for that. Did you
suggest that she use the pen?“</p>
<p>“Y–no–she–it was her own idea.“</p>
<p>The mother looked her pleasure, and said:</p>
<p>“I was hoping you would say that. There was never such a dear and
thoughtful child! . . . Aunt Hannah?“</p>
<p>“Dear Margaret?“</p>
<p>“Go and tell her I think of her all the time, and worship her.
Why–you are crying again. Don’t be so worried about me, dear; I think
there is nothing to fear, yet.“</p>
<p>The grieving messenger carried her message, and piously delivered it
to unheeding ears. The girl babbled on unaware; looking up at her with
wondering and startled eyes flaming with fever, eyes in which was no
light of recognition:</p>
<p>“Are you–no, you are not my mother. I want her–oh, I want her! She
was here a minute ago–I did not see her go. Will she come? will she come
quickly? will she come now? . . . There are so many houses . . . and
they oppress me so . . . and everything whirls and turns and whirls . .
. oh, my head, my head!“–and so she wandered on and on, in her pain,
flitting from one torturing fancy to another, and tossing her arms about
in a weary and ceaseless persecution of unrest.</p>
<p>Poor old Hannah wetted the parched lips and softly stroked the hot
brow, murmuring endearing and pitying words, and thanking the Father of
all that the mother was happy and did not know.</p>
