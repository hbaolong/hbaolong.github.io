<h4 id="speech-on-the-weather">SPEECH ON THE WEATHER</h4>
<p>AT THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY’S SEVENTY-FIRST ANNUAL DINNER, NEW YORK
CITY</p>
<p>The next toast was: “The Oldest Inhabitant–The Weather of New
England.“</p>
<p>Who can lose it and forget it? Who can have it and regret it?</p>
<p>Be interposes ’twixt us Twain. Merchant of Venice.</p>
<p>To this Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain) replied as follows:–</p>
<p>I reverently believe that the Maker who made us all makes everything
in New England but the weather. I don’t know who makes that, but I think
it must be raw apprentices in the weather-clerk’s factory who experiment
and learn how, in New England, for board and clothes, and then are
promoted to make weather for countries that require a good article, and
will take their custom elsewhere if they don’t get it. There is a
sumptuous variety about the New England weather that compels the
stranger’s admiration–and regret. The weather is always doing something
there; always attending strictly to business; always getting up new
designs and trying them on the people to see how they will go. But it
gets through more business in spring than in any other season. In the
spring I have counted one hundred and thirty-six different kinds of
weather inside of four-and-twenty hours. It was I that made the fame and
fortune of that man that had that marvelous collection of weather on
exhibition at the Centennial, that so astounded the foreigners. He was
going to travel all over the world and get specimens from all the
climes. I said, “Don’t you do it; you come to New England on a favorable
spring day.“ I told him what we could do in the way of style, variety,
and quantity. Well, he came and he made his collection in four days. As
to variety, why, he confessed that he got hundreds of kinds of weather
that he had never heard of before. And as to quantity–well, after he had
picked out and discarded all that was blemished in any way, he not only
had weather enough, but weather to spare; weather to hire out; weather
to sell; to deposit; weather to invest; weather to give to the poor. The
people of New England are by nature patient and forbearing, but there
are some things which they will not stand. Every year they kill a lot of
poets for writing about “Beautiful Spring.“ These are generally casual
visitors, who bring their notions of spring from somewhere else, and
cannot, of course, know how the natives feel about spring. And so the
first thing they know the opportunity to inquire how they feel has
permanently gone by. Old Probabilities has a mighty reputation for
accurate prophecy, and thoroughly well deserves it. You take up the
paper and observe how crisply and confidently he checks off what
to-day’s weather is going to be on the Pacific, down South, in the
Middle States, in the Wisconsin region. See him sail along in the joy
and pride of his power till he gets to New England, and then see his
tail drop. He doesn’t know what the weather is going to be in New
England. Well, he mulls over it, and by and by he gets out something
about like this: Probable northeast to southwest minds, varying to the
southward and westward and eastward, and points between, high and low
barometer swapping around from place to place; probable areas of rain,
snow, hail, and drought, succeeded or preceded by earthquakes, with
thunder and lightning. Then he jots down this postscript from his
wandering mind, to cover accidents: “But it is possible that the program
may be wholly changed in the mean time.“ Yes, one of the brightest gems
in the New England weather is the dazzling uncertainty of it. There is
only one thing certain about it: you are certain there is going to be
plenty of it–a perfect grand review; but you never can tell which end of
the procession is going to move first. You fix up for the drought; you
leave your umbrella in the house and sally out, and two to one you get
drowned. You make up your mind that the earthquake is due; you stand
from under, and take hold of something to steady yourself, and the first
thing you know you get struck by lightning. These are great
disappointments; but they can’t be helped. The lightning there is
peculiar; it is so convincing, that when it strikes a thing it doesn’t
leave enough of that thing behind for you to tell whether–Well, you’d
think it was something valuable, and a Congressman had been there. And
the thunder. When the thunder begins to merely tune up and scrape and
saw, and key up the instruments for the performance, strangers say,
“Why, what awful thunder you have here!“ But when the baton is raised
and the real concert begins, you’ll find that stranger down in the
cellar with his head in the ash-barrel. Now as to the size of the
weather in New England lengthways, I mean. It is utterly disproportioned
to the size of that little country. Half the time, when it is packed as
full as it can stick, you will see that New England weather sticking out
beyond the edges and projecting around hundreds and hundreds of miles
over the neighboring states. She can’t hold a tenth part of her weather.
You can see cracks all about where she has strained herself trying to do
it. I could speak volumes about the inhuman perversity of the New
England weather, but I will give but a single specimen. I like to hear
rain on a tin roof. So I covered part of my roof with tin, with an eye
to that luxury. Well, sir, do you think it ever rains on that tin? No,
sir; skips it every time. Mind, in this speech I have been trying merely
to do honor to the New England weather–no language could do it justice.
But, after all, there is at least one or two things about that weather
(or, if you please, effects produced, by it) which we residents would
not like to part with. If we hadn’t our bewitching autumn foliage, we
should still have to credit the weather with one feature which
compensates for all its bullying vagaries–the ice-storm: when a leafless
tree is clothed with ice from the bottom to the top–ice that is as
bright and clear as crystal; when every bough and twig is strung with
ice-beads, frozen dewdrops, and the whole tree sparkles cold and white,
like the Shah of Persia’s diamond plume. Then the wind waves the
branches and the sun comes out and turns all those myriads of beads and
drops to prisms that glow and burn and flash with all manner of colored
fires, which change and change again with inconceivable rapidity from
blue to red, from red to green, and green to gold–the tree becomes a
spraying fountain, a very explosion of dazzling jewels; and it stands
there the acme, the climax, the supremest possibility in art or nature,
of bewildering, intoxicating, intolerable magnificence. One cannot make
the words too strong.</p>
