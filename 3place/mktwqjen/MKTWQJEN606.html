<h4 id="chapter-8-why-the-scorners-relented">CHAPTER 8 Why the Scorners
Relented</h4>
<p>HUMAN NATURE is the same everywhere: it defies success, it has
nothing but scorn for defeat. The village considered that Joan had
disgraced it with her grotesque performance and its ridiculous failure;
so all the tongues were busy with the matter, and as bilious and bitter
as they were busy; insomuch that if the tongues had been teeth she would
not have survived her persecutions. Those persons who did not scold did
what was worse and harder to bear; for they ridiculed her, and mocked at
her, and ceased neither day nor night from their witticisms and jeerings
and laughter. Haumette and Little Mengette and I stood by her, but the
storm was too strong for her other friends, and they avoided her, being
ashamed to be seen with her because she was so unpopular, and because of
the sting of the taunts that assailed them on her account. She shed
tears in secret, but none in public. In public she carried herself with
serenity, and showed no distress, nor any resentment–conduct which
should have softened the feeling against her, but it did not. Her father
was so incensed that he could not talk in measured terms about her wild
project of going to the wars like a man. He had dreamed of her doing
such a thing, some time before, and now he remembered that dream with
apprehension and anger, and said that rather than see her unsex herself
and go away with the armies, he would require her brothers to drown her;
and that if they should refuse, he would do it with his own hands.</p>
<p>But none of these things shook her purpose in the least. Her parents
kept a strict watch upon her to keep her from leaving the village, but
she said her time was not yet; that when the time to go was come she
should know it, and then the keepers would watch in vain.</p>
<p>The summer wasted along; and when it was seen that her purpose
continued steadfast, the parents were glad of a chance which finally
offered itself for bringing her projects to an end through marriage. The
Paladin had the effrontery to pretend that she had engaged herself to
him several years before, and now he claimed a ratification of the
engagement.</p>
<p>She said his statement was not true, and refused to marry him. She
was cited to appear before the ecclesiastical court at Toul to answer
for her perversity; when she declined to have counsel, and elected to
conduct her case herself, her parents and all her ill-wishers rejoiced,
and looked upon her as already defeated. And that was natural enough;
for who would expect that an ignorant peasant-girl of sixteen would be
otherwise than frightened and tongue-tied when standing for the first
time in presence of the practised doctors of the law, and surrounded by
the cold solemnities of a court? Yet all these people were mistaken.
They flocked to Toul to see and enjoy this fright and embarrassment and
defeat, and they had their trouble for their pains. She was modest,
tranquil, and quite at her ease. She called no witnesses, saying she
would content herself with examining the witnesses for the prosecution.
When they had testified, she rose and reviewed their testimony in a few
words, pronounced it vague, confused, and of no force, then she placed
the Paladin again on the stand and began to search him. His previous
testimony went rag by rag to ruin under her ingenious hands, until at
last he stood bare, so to speak, he that had come so richly clothed in
fraud and falsehood. His counsel began an argument, but the court
declined to hear it, and threw out the case, adding a few words of grave
compliment for Joan, and referring to her as “this marvelous child.“</p>
<p>After this victory, with this high praise from so imposing a source
added, the fickle village turned again, and gave Joan countenance,
compliment, and peace. Her mother took her back to her heart, and even
her father relented and said he was proud of her. But the time hung
heavy on her hands, nevertheless, for the siege of Orleans was begun,
the clouds lowered darker and darker over France, and still her Voices
said wait, and gave her no direct commands. The winter set in, and wore
tediously along; but at last there was a change.</p>
