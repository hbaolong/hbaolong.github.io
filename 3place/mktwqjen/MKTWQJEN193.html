<h4 id="chapter-l.">CHAPTER L.</h4>
<p>It is impossible for the historian, with even the best intentions, to
control events or compel the persons of his narrative to act wisely or
to be successful. It is easy to see how things might have been better
managed; a very little change here and there would have made a very,
different history of this one now in hand.</p>
<p>If Philip had adopted some regular profession, even some trade, he
might now be a prosperous editor or a conscientious plumber, or an
honest lawyer, and have borrowed money at the saving’s bank and built a
cottage, and be now furnishing it for the occupancy of Ruth and himself.
Instead of this, with only a smattering of civil engineering, he is at
his mother’s house, fretting and fuming over his ill-luck, and the
hardness and, dishonesty of men, and thinking of nothing but how to get
the coal out of the Ilium hills.</p>
<p>If Senator Dilworthy had not made that visit to Hawkeye, the Hawkins
family and Col. Sellers would not now be dancing attendance upon
Congress, and endeavoring to tempt that immaculate body into one of
those appropriations, for the benefit of its members, which the members
find it so difficult to explain to their constituents; and Laura would
not be lying in the Tombs, awaiting her trial for murder, and doing her
best, by the help of able counsel, to corrupt the pure fountain of
criminal procedure in New York.</p>
<p>If Henry Brierly had been blown up on the first Mississippi steamboat
he set foot on, as the chances were that he would be, he and Col.
Sellers never would have gone into the Columbus Navigation scheme, and
probably never into the East Tennessee Land scheme, and he would not now
be detained in New York from very important business operations on the
Pacific coast, for the sole purpose of giving evidence to convict of
murder the only woman he ever loved half as much as he loves himself. If
Mr. Bolton had said the little word “no“ to Mr. Bigler, Alice Montague
might now be spending the winter in Philadelphia, and Philip also
(waiting to resume his mining operations in the spring); and Ruth would
not be an assistant in a Philadelphia hospital, taxing her strength with
arduous routine duties, day by day, in order to lighten a little the
burdens that weigh upon her unfortunate family.</p>
<p>It is altogether a bad business. An honest historian, who had
progressed thus far, and traced everything to such a condition of
disaster and suspension, might well be justified in ending his narrative
and writing –“after this the deluge.“ His only consolation would be in
the reflection that he was not responsible for either characters or
events.</p>
<p>And the most annoying thought is that a little money, judiciously
applied, would relieve the burdens and anxieties of most of these
people; but affairs seem to be so arranged that money is most difficult
to get when people need it most.</p>
<p>A little of what Mr. Bolton has weakly given to unworthy people would
now establish his family in a sort of comfort, and relieve Ruth of the
excessive toil for which she inherited no adequate physical vigor. A
little money would make a prince of Col. Sellers; and a little more
would calm the anxiety of Washington Hawkins about Laura, for however
the trial ended, he could feel sure of extricating her in the end. And
if Philip had a little money he could unlock the stone door in the
mountain whence would issue a stream of shining riches. It needs a
golden wand to strike that rock. If the Knobs University bill could only
go through, what a change would be wrought in the condition of most of
the persons in this history. Even Philip himself would feel the good
effects of it; for Harry would have something and Col. Sellers would
have something; and have not both these cautious people expressed a
determination to take an interest in the Ilium mine when they catch
their larks?</p>
<p>Philip could not resist the inclination to pay a visit to Fallkill.
He had not been at the Montague’s since the time he saw Ruth there, and
he wanted to consult the Squire about an occupation. He was determined
now to waste no more time in waiting on Providence, but to go to work at
something, if it were nothing better, than teaching in the Fallkill
Seminary, or digging clams on Hingham beach. Perhaps he could read law
in Squire Montague’s office while earning his bread as a teacher in the
Seminary.</p>
<p>It was not altogether Philip’s fault, let us own, that he was in this
position. There are many young men like him in American society, of his
age, opportunities, education and abilities, who have really been
educated for nothing and have let themselves drift, in the hope that
they will find somehow, and by some sudden turn of good luck, the golden
road to fortune. He was not idle or lazy, he had energy and a
disposition to carve his own way. But he was born into a time when all
young men of his age caught the fever of speculation, and expected to
get on in the world by the omission of some of the regular processes
which have been appointed from of old. And examples were not wanting to
encourage him. He saw people, all around him, poor yesterday, rich
to-day, who had come into sudden opulence by some means which they could
not have classified among any of the regular occupations of life. A war
would give such a fellow a career and very likely fame. He might have
been a “railroad man,“ or a politician, or a land speculator, or one of
those mysterious people who travel free on all rail-roads and
steamboats, and are continually crossing and recrossing the Atlantic,
driven day and night about nobody knows what, and make a great deal of
money by so doing. Probably, at last, he sometimes thought with a
whimsical smile, he should end by being an insurance agent, and asking
people to insure their lives for his benefit.</p>
<p>Possibly Philip did not think how much the attractions of Fallkill
were increased by the presence of Alice there. He had known her so long,
she had somehow grown into his life by habit, that he would expect the
pleasure of her society without thinking mach about it. Latterly he
never thought of her without thinking of Ruth, and if he gave the
subject any attention, it was probably in an undefined consciousness
that, he had her sympathy in his love, and that she was always willing
to hear him talk about it. If he ever wondered that Alice herself was
not in love and never spoke of the possibility of her own marriage, it
was a transient thought for love did not seem necessary, exactly, to one
so calm and evenly balanced and with so many resources in her
herself.</p>
<p>Whatever her thoughts may have been they were unknown to Philip, as
they are to these historians; if she was seeming to be what she was not,
and carrying a burden heavier than any one else carried, because she had
to bear it alone, she was only doing what thousands of women do, with a
self-renunciation and heroism, of which men, impatient and complaining,
have no conception. Have not these big babies with beards filled all
literature with their outcries, their griefs and their lamentations? It
is always the gentle sex which is hard and cruel and fickle and
implacable.</p>
<p>“Do you think you would be contented to live in Fallkill, and attend
the county Court?“ asked Alice, when Philip had opened the budget of his
new programme.</p>
<p>“Perhaps not always,“ said Philip, “I might go and practice in Boston
maybe, or go to Chicago.“</p>
<p>“Or you might get elected to Congress.“</p>
<p>Philip looked at Alice to see if she was in earnest and not chaffing
him. Her face was quite sober. Alice was one of those patriotic women in
the rural districts, who think men are still selected for Congress on
account of qualifications for the office.</p>
<p>“No,“ said Philip, “the chances are that a man cannot get into
congress now without resorting to arts and means that should render hint
unfit to go there; of course there are exceptions; but do you know that
I could not go into politics if I were a lawyer, without losing standing
somewhat in my profession, and without raising at least a suspicion of
my intentions and unselfishness? Why, it is telegraphed all over the
country and commented on as something wonderful if a congressman votes
honestly and unselfishly and refuses to take advantage of his position
to steal from the government.“</p>
<p>“But,“ insisted Alice, “I should think it a noble ambition to go to
congress, if it is so bad, and help reform it. I don’t believe it is as
corrupt as the English parliament used to be, if there is any truth in
the novels, and I suppose that is reformed.“</p>
<p>“I’m sure I don’t know where the reform is to begin. I’ve seen a
perfectly capable, honest man, time and again, run against an illiterate
trickster, and get beaten. I suppose if the people wanted decent members
of congress they would elect them. Perhaps,“ continued Philip with a
smile, “the women will have to vote.“</p>
<p>“Well, I should be willing to, if it were a necessity, just as I
would go to war and do what I could, if the country couldn’t be saved
otherwise,“ said Alice, with a spirit that surprised Philip, well as he
thought he knew her. “If I were a young gentleman in these times–“</p>
<p>Philip laughed outright. “It’s just what Ruth used to say, ‘if she
were a man.’ I wonder if all the young ladies are contemplating a change
of sex.“</p>
<p>“No, only a changed sex,“ retorted Alice; “we contemplate for the
most part young men who don’t care for anything they ought to care
for.“</p>
<p>“Well,“ said Philip, looking humble, “I care for some things, you and
Ruth for instance; perhaps I ought not to. Perhaps I ought to care for
Congress and that sort of thing.“</p>
<p>“Don’t be a goose, Philip. I heard from Ruth yesterday.“</p>
<p>“Can I see her letter?“</p>
<p>“No, indeed. But I am afraid her hard work is telling on her,
together with her anxiety about her father.“</p>
<p>“Do you think, Alice,“ asked Philip with one of those selfish
thoughts that are not seldom mixed with real love, “that Ruth prefers
her profession to–to marriage?“</p>
<p>“Philip,“ exclaimed Alice, rising to quit the room, and speaking
hurriedly as if the words were forced from her, “you are as blind as a
bat; Ruth would cut off her right hand for you this minute.“</p>
<p>Philip never noticed that Alice’s face was flushed and that her voice
was unsteady; he only thought of the delicious words he had heard. And
the poor girl, loyal to Ruth, loyal to Philip, went straight to her
room, locked the door, threw herself on the bed and sobbed as if her
heart world break. And then she prayed that her Father in Heaven would
give her strength. And after a time she was calm again, and went to her
bureau drawer and took from a hiding place a little piece of paper,
yellow with age. Upon it was pinned a four-leaved clover, dry and yellow
also. She looked long at this foolish memento. Under the clover leaf was
written in a school-girl’s hand–“Philip, June, 186-.“</p>
<p>Squire Montague thought very well of Philip’s proposal. It would have
been better if he had begun the study of the law as soon as he left
college, but it was not too late now, and besides he had gathered some
knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>“But,“ asked the Squire, “do you mean to abandon your land in
Pennsylvania?“ This track of land seemed an immense possible fortune to
this New England lawyer-farmer. Hasn’t it good timber, and doesn’t the
railroad almost touch it?“</p>
<p>“I can’t do anything with it now. Perhaps I can sometime.“</p>
<p>“What is your reason for supposing that there is coal there?“</p>
<p>“The opinion of the best geologist I could consult, my own
observation of the country, and the little veins of it we found. I feel
certain it is there. I shall find it some day. I know it. If I can only
keep the land till I make money enough to try again.“</p>
<p>Philip took from his pocket a map of the anthracite coal region, and
pointed out the position of the Ilium mountain which he had begun to
tunnel.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t it look like it?“</p>
<p>“It certainly does,“ said the Squire, very much interested. It is not
unusual for a quiet country gentleman to be more taken with such a
venture than a speculator who, has had more experience in its
uncertainty. It was astonishing how many New England clergymen, in the
time of the petroleum excitement, took chances in oil. The Wall street
brokers are said to do a good deal of small business for country
clergymen, who are moved no doubt with the laudable desire of purifying
the New York stock board.</p>
<p>“I don’t see that there is much risk,“ said the Squire, at length.
“The timber is worth more than the mortgage; and if that coal seam does
run there, it’s a magnificent fortune. Would you like to try it again in
the spring, Phil?“</p>
<p>Like to try it! If he could have a little help, he would work
himself, with pick and barrow, and live on a crust. Only give him one
more chance.</p>
<p>And this is how it came about that the cautious old Squire Montague
was drawn into this young fellow’s speculation, and began to have his
serene old age disturbed by anxieties and by the hope of a great stroke
of luck.</p>
<p>“To be sure, I only care about it for the boy,“ he said. The Squire
was like everybody else; sooner or later he must “take a chance.“</p>
<p>It is probably on account of the lack of enterprise in women that
they are not so fond of stock speculations and mine ventures as men. It
is only when woman becomes demoralized that she takes to any sort of
gambling. Neither Alice nor Ruth were much elated with the prospect of
Philip’s renewal of his mining enterprise.</p>
<p>But Philip was exultant. He wrote to Ruth as if his fortune were
already made, and as if the clouds that lowered over the house of Bolton
were already in the deep bosom of a coal mine buried. Towards spring he
went to Philadelphia with his plans all matured for a new campaign. His
enthusiasm was irresistible.</p>
<p>“Philip has come, Philip has come,“ cried the children, as if some
great good had again come into the household; and the refrain even sang
itself over in Ruth’s heart as she went the weary hospital rounds.
Mr. Bolton felt more courage than he had had in months, at the sight of
his manly face and the sound of his cheery voice.</p>
<p>Ruth’s course was vindicated now, and it certainly did not become
Philip, who had nothing to offer but a future chance against the visible
result of her determination and industry, to open an argument with her.
Ruth was never more certain that she was right and that she was
sufficient unto herself. She, may be, did not much heed the still small
voice that sang in her maiden heart as she went about her work, and
which lightened it and made it easy, “Philip has come.“</p>
<p>“I am glad for father’s sake,“ she said to Philip, that thee has
come. “I can see that he depends greatly upon what thee can do. He
thinks women won’t hold out long,“ added Ruth with the smile that Philip
never exactly understood.</p>
<p>“And aren’t you tired sometimes of the struggle?“</p>
<p>“Tired? Yes, everybody is tired I suppose. But it is a glorious
profession. And would you want me to be dependent, Philip?“</p>
<p>“Well, yes, a little,“ said Philip, feeling his way towards what he
wanted to say.</p>
<p>“On what, for instance, just now?“ asked Ruth, a little maliciously
Philip thought.</p>
<p>“Why, on—-“ he couldn’t quite say it, for it occurred to him that he
was a poor stick for any body to lean on in the present state of his
fortune, and that the woman before him was at least as independent as he
was.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean depend,“ he began again. “But I love you, that’s all.
Am I nothing–to you?“ And Philip looked a little defiant, and as if he
had said something that ought to brush away all the sophistries of
obligation on either side, between man and woman.</p>
<p>Perhaps Ruth saw this. Perhaps she saw that her own theories of a
certain equality of power, which ought to precede a union of two hearts,
might be pushed too far. Perhaps she had felt sometimes her own weakness
and the need after all of so dear a sympathy and so tender an interest
confessed, as that which Philip could give. Whatever moved her–the
riddle is as old as creation–she simply looked up to Philip and said in
a low voice, “Everything.“</p>
<p>And Philip clasping both her hands in his, and looking down into her
eyes, which drank in all his tenderness with the thirst of a true
woman’s nature–</p>
<p>“Oh! Philip, come out here,“ shouted young Eli, throwing the door
wide open.</p>
<p>And Ruth escaped away to her room, her heart singing again, and now
as if it would burst for joy, “Philip has come.“</p>
<p>That night Philip received a dispatch from Harry–“The trial begins
tomorrow.“</p>
<p>CHAPTER, LI</p>
<p>December 18–, found Washington Hawkins and Col. Sellers once more at
the capitol of the nation, standing guard over the University bill. The
former gentleman was despondent, the latter hopeful. Washington’s
distress of mind was chiefly on Laura’s account. The court would soon
sit to try her, case, he said, and consequently a great deal of ready
money would be needed in the engineering of it. The University bill was
sure to pass this, time, and that would make money plenty, but might not
the, help come too late? Congress had only just assembled, and delays
were to be feared.</p>
<p>“Well,“ said the Colonel, “I don’t know but you are more or less
right, there. Now let’s figure up a little on, the preliminaries. I
think Congress always tries to do as near right as it can, according to
its lights. A man can’t ask any fairer, than that. The first preliminary
it always starts out on, is, to clean itself, so to speak. It will
arraign two or three dozen of its members, or maybe four or five dozen,
for taking bribes to vote for this and that and the other bill last
winter.“</p>
<p>“It goes up into the dozens, does it?“</p>
<p>“Well, yes; in a free country likes ours, where any man can run for
Congress and anybody can vote for him, you can’t expect immortal purity
all the time–it ain’t in nature. Sixty or eighty or a hundred and fifty
people are bound to get in who are not angels in disguise, as young
Hicks the correspondent says; but still it is a very good average; very
good indeed. As long as it averages as well as that, I think we can feel
very well satisfied. Even in these days, when people growl so much and
the newspapers are so out of patience, there is still a very respectable
minority of honest men in Congress.“</p>
<p>“Why a respectable minority of honest men can’t do any good,
Colonel.“</p>
<p>“Oh, yes it can, too“</p>
<p>“Why, how?“</p>
<p>“Oh, in many ways, many ways.“</p>
<p>“But what are the ways?“</p>
<p>“Well–I don’t know–it is a question that requires time; a body can’t
answer every question right off-hand. But it does do good. I am
satisfied of that.“</p>
<p>“All right, then; grant that it does good; go on with the
preliminaries.“</p>
<p>“That is what I am coming to. First, as I said, they will try a lot
of members for taking money for votes. That will take four weeks.“</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s like last year; and it is a sheer waste of the time for
which the nation pays those men to work–that is what that is. And it
pinches when a body’s got a bill waiting.“</p>
<p>“A waste of time, to purify the fountain of public law? Well, I never
heard anybody express an idea like that before. But if it were, it would
still be the fault of the minority, for the majority don’t institute
these proceedings. There is where that minority becomes an obstruction
–but still one can’t say it is on the wrong side.–Well, after they have
finished the bribery cases, they will take up cases of members who have
bought their seats with money. That will take another four weeks.“</p>
<p>“Very good; go on. You have accounted for two-thirds of the
session.“</p>
<p>“Next they will try each other for various smaller irregularities,
like the sale of appointments to West Point cadetships, and that sort of
thing–mere trifling pocket-money enterprises that might better, be
passed over in silence, perhaps, but then one of our Congresses can
never rest easy till it has thoroughly purified itself of all
blemishes–and that is a thing to be applauded.“</p>
<p>“How long does it take to disinfect itself of these minor
impurities?“</p>
<p>“Well, about two weeks, generally.“</p>
<p>“So Congress always lies helpless in quarantine ten weeks of a
session. That’s encouraging. Colonel, poor Laura will never get any
benefit from our bill. Her trial will be over before Congress has half
purified itself.–And doesn’t it occur to you that by the time it has
expelled all its impure members there, may not be enough members left to
do business legally?“</p>
<p>“Why I did not say Congress would expel anybody.“</p>
<p>“Well won’t it expel anybody?“</p>
<p>“Not necessarily. Did it last year? It never does. That would not be
regular.“</p>
<p>“Then why waste all the session in that tomfoolery of trying
members?“</p>
<p>“It is usual; it is customary; the country requires it.“</p>
<p>“Then the country is a fool, I think.“</p>
<p>“Oh, no. The country thinks somebody is going to be expelled.“</p>
<p>“Well, when nobody is expelled, what does the country think
then?“</p>
<p>“By that time, the thing has strung out so long that the country is
sick and tired of it and glad to have a change on any terms. But all
that inquiry is not lost. It has a good moral effect.“</p>
<p>“Who does it have a good moral effect on?“</p>
<p>“Well–I don’t know. On foreign countries, I think. We have always
been under the gaze of foreign countries. There is no country in the
world, sir, that pursues corruption as inveterately as we do. There is
no country in the world whose representatives try each other as much as
ours do, or stick to it as long on a stretch. I think there is something
great in being a model for the whole civilized world, Washington“</p>
<p>“You don’t mean a model; you mean an example.“</p>
<p>“Well, it’s all the same; it’s just the same thing. It shows that a
man can’t be corrupt in this country without sweating for it, I can tell
you that.“</p>
<p>“Hang it, Colonel, you just said we never punish anybody for
villainous practices.“</p>
<p>“But good God we try them, don’t we! Is it nothing to show a
disposition to sift things and bring people to a strict account? I tell
you it has its effect.“</p>
<p>“Oh, bother the effect!–What is it they do do? How do they proceed?
You know perfectly well–and it is all bosh, too. Come, now, how do they
proceed?“</p>
<p>“Why they proceed right and regular–and it ain’t bosh, Washington, it
ain’t bosh. They appoint a committee to investigate, and that committee
hears evidence three weeks, and all the witnesses on one side swear that
the accused took money or stock or something for his vote. Then the
accused stands up and testifies that he may have done it, but he was
receiving and handling a good deal of money at the time and he doesn’t
remember this particular circumstance–at least with sufficient
distinctness to enable him to grasp it tangibly. So of course the thing
is not proven–and that is what they say in the verdict. They don’t
acquit, they don’t condemn. They just say, ‘Charge not proven.’ It
leaves the accused is a kind of a shaky condition before the country, it
purifies Congress, it satisfies everybody, and it doesn’t seriously hurt
anybody. It has taken a long time to perfect our system, but it is the
most admirable in the world, now.“</p>
<p>“So one of those long stupid investigations always turns out in that
lame silly way. Yes, you are correct. I thought maybe you viewed the
matter differently from other people. Do you think a Congress of ours
could convict the devil of anything if he were a member?“</p>
<p>“My dear boy, don’t let these damaging delays prejudice you against
Congress. Don’t use such strong language; you talk like a newspaper.
Congress has inflicted frightful punishments on its members–now you know
that. When they tried Mr. Fairoaks, and a cloud of witnesses proved him
to be–well, you know what they proved him to be–and his own testimony
and his own confessions gave him the same character, what did Congress
do then?–come!“</p>
<p>“Well, what did Congress do?“</p>
<p>“You know what Congress did, Washington. Congress intimated plainly
enough, that they considered him almost a stain upon their body; and
without waiting ten days, hardly, to think the thing over, the rose up
and hurled at him a resolution declaring that they disapproved of his
conduct! Now you know that, Washington.“</p>
<p>“It was a terrific thing–there is no denying that. If he had been
proven guilty of theft, arson, licentiousness, infanticide, and defiling
graves, I believe they would have suspended him for two days.“</p>
<p>“You can depend on it, Washington. Congress is vindictive, Congress
is savage, sir, when it gets waked up once. It will go to any length to
vindicate its honor at such a time.“</p>
<p>“Ah well, we have talked the morning through, just as usual in these
tiresome days of waiting, and we have reached the same old result; that
is to say, we are no better off than when we began. The land bill is
just as far away as ever, and the trial is closer at hand. Let’s give up
everything and die.“</p>
<p>“Die and leave the Duchess to fight it out all alone? Oh, no, that
won’t do. Come, now, don’t talk so. It is all going to come out right.
Now you’ll see.“</p>
<p>“It never will, Colonel, never in the world. Something tells me that.
I get more tired and more despondent every day. I don’t see any hope;
life is only just a trouble. I am so miserable, these days!“</p>
<p>The Colonel made Washington get up and walk the floor with him, arm
in arm. The good old speculator wanted to comfort him, but he hardly
knew how to go about it. He made many attempts, but they were lame; they
lacked spirit; the words were encouraging; but they were only words–he
could not get any heart into them. He could not always warm up, now,
with the old Hawkeye fervor. By and by his lips trembled and his voice
got unsteady. He said:</p>
<p>“Don’t give up the ship, my boy–don’t do it. The wind’s bound to
fetch around and set in our favor. I know it.“</p>
<p>And the prospect was so cheerful that he wept. Then he blew a
trumpet-blast that started the meshes of his handkerchief, and said in
almost his breezy old-time way:</p>
<p>“Lord bless us, this is all nonsense! Night doesn’t last always; day
has got to break some time or other. Every silver lining has a cloud
behind it, as the poet says; and that remark has always cheered me;
though –I never could see any meaning to it. Everybody uses it, though,
and everybody gets comfort out of it. I wish they would start something
fresh. Come, now, let’s cheer up; there’s been as good fish in the sea
as there are now. It shall never be said that Beriah Sellers –Come
in?“</p>
<p>It was the telegraph boy. The Colonel reached for the message and
devoured its contents:</p>
<p>“I said it! Never give up the ship! The trial’s, postponed till
February, and we’ll save the child yet. Bless my life, what lawyers
they, have in New-York! Give them money to fight with; and the ghost of
an excuse, and they: would manage to postpone anything in this world,
unless it might be the millennium or something like that. Now for work
again my boy. The trial will last to the middle of March, sure; Congress
ends the fourth of March. Within three days of the end of the session
they will be done putting through the preliminaries then they will be
ready for national business: Our bill will go through in forty-eight
hours, then, and we’ll telegraph a million dollar’s to the jury–to the
lawyers, I mean–and the verdict of the jury will be ‘Accidental murder
resulting from justifiable insanity’–or something to, that effect,
something to that effect.–Everything is dead sure, now. Come, what is
the matter? What are you wilting down like that, for? You mustn’t be a
girl, you know.“</p>
<p>“Oh, Colonel, I am become so used to troubles, so used to failures,
disappointments, hard luck of all kinds, that a little good news breaks
me right down. Everything has been so hopeless that now I can’t stand
good news at all. It is too good to be true, anyway. Don’t you see how
our bad luck has worked on me? My hair is getting gray, and many nights
I don’t sleep at all. I wish it was all over and we could rest. I wish
we could lie, down and just forget everything, and let it all be just a
dream that is done and can’t come back to trouble us any more. I am so
tired.“</p>
<p>“Ah, poor child, don’t talk like that-cheer up–there’s daylight
ahead. Don’t give, up. You’ll have Laura again, and–Louise, and your
mother, and oceans and oceans of money–and then you can go away, ever so
far away somewhere, if you want to, and forget all about this infernal
place. And by George I’ll go with you! I’ll go with you–now there’s my
word on it. Cheer up. I’ll run out and tell the friends the news.“</p>
<p>And he wrung Washington’s hand and was about to hurry away when his
companion, in a burst of grateful admiration said:</p>
<p>“I think you are the best soul and the noblest I ever knew, Colonel
Sellers! and if the people only knew you as I do, you would not be
tagging around here a nameless man–you would be in Congress.“</p>
<p>The gladness died out of the Colonel’s face, and he laid his hand
upon Washington’s shoulder and said gravely:</p>
<p>“I have always been a friend of your family, Washington, and I think
I have always tried to do right as between man and man, according to my
lights. Now I don’t think there has ever been anything in my conduct
that should make you feel Justified in saying a thing like that.“</p>
<p>He turned, then, and walked slowly out, leaving Washington abashed
and somewhat bewildered. When Washington had presently got his thoughts
into line again, he said to himself, “Why, honestly, I only meant to
compliment him–indeed I would not have hurt him for the world.“</p>
