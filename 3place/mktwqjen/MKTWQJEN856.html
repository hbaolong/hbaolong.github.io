XV–GENERAL ALISON TO MRS. DRAKE, THE COLONEL’S WIFE</h4>
<p>To return, now, to where I was, and tell you the rest. We shall never
know how she came to be there; there is no way to account for it. She
was always watching for black and shiny and spirited horses–watching,
hoping, despairing, hoping again; always giving chase and sounding her
call, upon the meagrest chance of a response, and breaking her heart
over the disappointment; always inquiring, always interested in
sales-stables and horse accumulations in general. How she got there must
remain a mystery.</p>
<p>At the point which I had reached in a preceding paragraph of this
account, the situation was as follows: two horses lay dying; the bull
had scattered his persecutors for the moment, and stood raging, panting,
pawing the dust in clouds over his back, when the man that had been
wounded returned to the ring on a remount, a poor blindfolded wreck that
yet had something ironically military about his bearing–and the next
moment the bull had ripped him open and his bowls were dragging upon the
ground: and the bull was charging his swarm of pests again. Then came
pealing through the air a bugle-call that froze my blood–“IT IS I,
SOLDIER–COME!“ I turned; Cathy was flying down through the massed
people; she cleared the parapet at a bound, and sped towards that
riderless horse, who staggered forward towards the remembered sound; but
his strength failed, and he fell at her feet, she lavishing kisses upon
him and sobbing, the house rising with one impulse, and white with
horror! Before help could reach her the bull was back again–</p>
<p>She was never conscious again in life. We bore her home, all mangled
and drenched in blood, and knelt by her and listened to her broken and
wandering words, and prayed for her passing spirit, and there was no
comfort–nor ever will be, I think. But she was happy, for she was far
away under another sky, and comrading again with her Rangers, and her
animal friends, and the soldiers. Their names fell softly and
caressingly from her lips, one by one, with pauses between. She was not
in pain, but lay with closed eyes, vacantly murmuring, as one who
dreams. Sometimes she smiled, saying nothing; sometimes she smiled when
she uttered a name–such as Shekels, or BB, or Potter. Sometimes she was
at her fort, issuing commands; sometimes she was careering over the
plain at the head of her men; sometimes she was training her horse; once
she said, reprovingly, “You are giving me the wrong foot; give me the
left–don’t you know it is good-bye?“</p>
<p>After this, she lay silent some time; the end was near. By-and-by she
murmured, “Tired . . . sleepy . . . take Cathy, mamma.“ Then, “Kiss me,
Soldier.“ For a little time, she lay so still that we were doubtful if
she breathed. Then she put out her hand and began to feel gropingly
about; then said, “I cannot find it; blow ‘taps.’“ It was the end.</p>
<p>End of A Horse’s Tale by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)</p>

<p>by Mark Twain</p>
<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>Book I of this volume occupies a quarter or a third of the volume,
and consists of matter written about four years ago, but not hitherto
published in book form. It contained errors of judgment and of fact. I
have now corrected these to the best of my ability and later
knowledge.</p>
<p>Book II was written at the beginning of 1903, and has not until now
appeared in any form. In it my purpose has been to present a
character-portrait of Mrs. Eddy, drawn from her own acts and words
solely, not from hearsay and rumor; and to explain the nature and scope
of her Monarchy, as revealed in the Laws by which she governs it, and
which she wrote herself.</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN NEW YORK. January, 1907.</p>
<p>BOOK I CHRISTIAN SCIENCE</p>
<p>“It is the first time since the dawn-days of Creation that a Voice
has gone crashing through space with such placid and complacent
confidence and command.“</p>
