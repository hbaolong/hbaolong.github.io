<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>THE TOURNAMENT</p>
<p>They were always having grand tournaments there at Camelot; and very
stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull-fights they were,
too, but just a little wearisome to the practical mind. However, I was
generally on hand–for two reasons: a man must not hold himself aloof
from the things which his friends and his community have at heart if he
would be liked–especially as a statesman; and both as business man and
statesman I wanted to study the tournament and see if I couldn’t invent
an improvement on it. That reminds me to remark, in passing, that the
very first official thing I did, in my administration–and it was on the
very first day of it, too–was to start a patent office; for I knew that
a country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab,
and couldn’t travel any way but sideways or backways.</p>
<p>Things ran along, a tournament nearly every week; and now and then
the boys used to want me to take a hand–I mean Sir Launcelot and the
rest–but I said I would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much government
machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going.</p>
<p>We had one tournament which was continued from day to day during more
than a week, and as many as five hundred knights took part in it, from
first to last. They were weeks gathering. They came on horseback from
everywhere; from the very ends of the country, and even from beyond the
sea; and many brought ladies, and all brought squires and troops of
servants. It was a most gaudy and gorgeous crowd, as to costumery, and
very characteristic of the country and the time, in the way of high
animal spirits, innocent indecencies of language, and happy-hearted
indifference to morals. It was fight or look on, all day and every day;
and sing, gamble, dance, carouse half the night every night. They had a
most noble good time. You never saw such people. Those banks of
beautiful ladies, shining in their barbaric splendors, would see a
knight sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the
thickness of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting, and
instead of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for
a better view; only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief, and
look ostentatiously broken-hearted, and then you could lay two to one
that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was afraid the public
hadn’t found it out.</p>
<p>The noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily, but I
didn’t mind it in the present circumstances, because it kept me from
hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day’s cripples. They
ruined an uncommon good old cross-cut saw for me, and broke the
saw-buck, too, but I let it pass. And as for my axe–well, I made up my
mind that the next time I lent an axe to a surgeon I would pick my
century.</p>
<p>I not only watched this tournament from day to day, but detailed an
intelligent priest from my Department of Public Morals and Agriculture,
and ordered him to report it; for it was my purpose by and by, when I
should have gotten the people along far enough, to start a newspaper.
The first thing you want in a new country, is a patent office; then work
up your school system; and after that, out with your paper. A newspaper
has its faults, and plenty of them, but no matter, it’s hark from the
tomb for a dead nation, and don’t you forget it. You can’t resurrect a
dead nation without it; there isn’t any way. So I wanted to sample
things, and be finding out what sort of reporter-material I might be
able to rake together out of the sixth century when I should come to
need it.</p>
<p>Well, the priest did very well, considering. He got in all the
details, and that is a good thing in a local item: you see, he had kept
books for the undertaker-department of his church when he was younger,
and there, you know, the money’s in the details; the more details, the
more swag: bearers, mutes, candles, prayers –everything counts; and if
the bereaved don’t buy prayers enough you mark up your candles with a
forked pencil, and your bill shows up all right. And he had a good knack
at getting in the complimentary thing here and there about a knight that
was likely to advertise–no, I mean a knight that had influence; and he
also had a neat gift of exaggeration, for in his time he had kept door
for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles.</p>
<p>Of course this novice’s report lacked whoop and crash and lurid
description, and therefore wanted the true ring; but its antique wording
was quaint and sweet and simple, and full of the fragrances and flavors
of the time, and these little merits made up in a measure for its more
important lacks. Here is an extract from it:</p>
<p>Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummorsum, knights of the
castle, encountered with Sir Aglovale and Sir Tor, and Sir Tor smote
down Sir Grummore Grummorsum to the earth. Then came Sir Carados of the
dolorous tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle, and there
encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Lamorak de Galis,
that were two brethren, and there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir
Carados, and either brake their spears unto their hands, and then Sir
Turquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote down other, horse
and all, to the earth, and either parties rescued other and horsed them
again. And Sir Arnold, and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle,
encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these four knights
encountered mightily, and brake their spears to their hands. Then came
Sir Pertolope from the castle, and there encountered with him Sir
Lionel, and there Sir Pertolope the green knight smote down Sir Lionel,
brother to Sir Launcelot. All this was marked by noble heralds, who bare
him best, and their names. Then Sir Bleobaris brake his spear upon Sir
Gareth, but of that stroke Sir Bleobaris fell to the earth. When Sir
Galihodin saw that, he bad Sir Gareth keep him, and Sir Gareth smote him
to the earth. Then Sir Galihud gat a spear to avenge his brother, and in
the same wise Sir Gareth served him, and Sir Dinadan and his brother La
Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le Disirous, and Sir Dodinas le
Savage; all these he bare down with one spear. When King Aswisance of
Ireland saw Sir Gareth fare so he marvelled what he might be, that one
time seemed green, and another time, at his again coming, he seemed
blue. And thus at every course that he rode to and fro he changed his
color, so that there might neither king nor knight have ready cognizance
of him. Then Sir Agwisance the King of Ireland encountered with Sir
Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him from his horse, saddle and all.
And then came King Carados of Scotland, and Sir Gareth smote him down
horse and man. And in the same wise he served King Uriens of the land of
Gore. And then there came in Six Bagdemagus, and Sir Gareth smote him
down horse and man to the earth. And Bagdemagus’s son Meliganus brake a
spear upon Sir Gareth mightily and knightly. And then Sir Galahault the
noble prince cried on high, Knight with the many colors, well hast thou
justed; now make thee ready that I may just with thee. Sir Gareth heard
him, and he gat a great spear, and so they encountered together, and
there the prince brake his spear; but Sir Gareth smote him upon the left
side of the helm, that he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down
had not his men recovered him. Truly, said King Arthur, that knight with
the many colors is a good knight. Wherefore the king called unto him Sir
Launcelot, and prayed him to encounter with that knight. Sir, said
Launcelot, I may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at this
time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and when a good knight
doth so well upon some day, it is no good knight’s part to let him of
his worship, and, namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great
labour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his quarrel is here this
day, and peradventure he is best beloved with this lady of all that be
here, for I see well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great
deeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me, this day he shall
have the honour; though it lay in my power to put him from it, I would
not.</p>
<p>There was an unpleasant little episode that day, which for reasons of
state I struck out of my priest’s report. You will have noticed that
Garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement. When I say Garry
I mean Sir Gareth. Garry was my private pet name for him; it suggests
that I had a deep affection for him, and that was the case. But it was a
private pet name only, and never spoken aloud to any one, much less to
him; being a noble, he would not have endured a familiarity like that
from me. Well, to proceed: I sat in the private box set apart for me as
the king’s minister. While Sir Dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter
the lists, he came in there and sat down and began to talk; for he was
always making up to me, because I was a stranger and he liked to have a
fresh market for his jokes, the most of them having reached that stage
of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while the other
person looks sick. I had always responded to his efforts as well as I
could, and felt a very deep and real kindness for him, too, for the
reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one particular anecdote
which I had heard oftenest and had most hated and most loathed all my
life, he had at least spared it me. It was one which I had heard
attributed to every humorous person who had ever stood on American soil,
from Columbus down to Artemus Ward. It was about a humorous lecturer who
flooded an ignorant audience with the killingest jokes for an hour and
never got a laugh; and then when he was leaving, some gray simpletons
wrung him gratefully by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing
they had ever heard, and “it was all they could do to keep from laughin’
right out in meetin’.“ That anecdote never saw the day that it was worth
the telling; and yet I had sat under the telling of it hundreds and
thousands and millions and billions of times, and cried and cursed all
the way through. Then who can hope to know what my feelings were, to
hear this armor-plated ass start in on it again, in the murky twilight
of tradition, before the dawn of history, while even Lactantius might be
referred to as “the late Lactantius,“ and the Crusades wouldn’t be born
for five hundred years yet? Just as he finished, the call-boy came; so,
haw-hawing like a demon, he went rattling and clanking out like a crate
of loose castings, and I knew nothing more. It was some minutes before I
came to, and then I opened my eyes just in time to see Sir Gareth fetch
him an awful welt, and I unconsciously out with the prayer, “I hope to
gracious he’s killed!“ But by ill-luck, before I had got half through
with the words, Sir Gareth crashed into Sir Sagramor le Desirous and
sent him thundering over his horse’s crupper, and Sir Sagramor caught my
remark and thought I meant it for <em>him</em>.</p>
<p>Well, whenever one of those people got a thing into his head, there
was no getting it out again. I knew that, so I saved my breath, and
offered no explanations. As soon as Sir Sagramor got well, he notified
me that there was a little account to settle between us, and he named a
day three or four years in the future; place of settlement, the lists
where the offense had been given. I said I would be ready when he got
back. You see, he was going for the Holy Grail. The boys all took a
flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was a several years’ cruise.
They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most
conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail
really was, and I don’t think any of them actually expected to find it,
or would have known what to do with it if he <em>had</em> run across it.
You see, it was just the Northwest Passage of that day, as you may say;
that was all. Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next
year relief expeditions went out to hunt for <em>them</em>. There was
worlds of reputation in it, but no money. Why, they actually wanted
<em>me</em> to put in! Well, I should smile.</p>
<p>CHAPTER</p>
<p>XBEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION</p>
<p>The Round Table soon heard of the challenge, and of course it was a
good deal discussed, for such things interested the boys. The king
thought I ought now to set forth in quest of adventures, so that I might
gain renown and be the more worthy to meet Sir Sagramor when the several
years should have rolled away. I excused myself for the present; I said
it would take me three or four years yet to get things well fixed up and
going smoothly; then I should be ready; all the chances were that at the
end of that time Sir Sagramor would still be out grailing, so no
valuable time would be lost by the postponement; I should then have been
in office six or seven years, and I believed my system and machinery
would be so well developed that I could take a holiday without its
working any harm.</p>
<p>I was pretty well satisfied with what I had already accomplished. In
various quiet nooks and corners I had the beginnings of all sorts of
industries under way–nuclei of future vast factories, the iron and steel
missionaries of my future civilization. In these were gathered together
the brightest young minds I could find, and I kept agents out raking the
country for more, all the time. I was training a crowd of ignorant folk
into experts–experts in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling.
These nurseries of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in
their obscure country retreats, for nobody was allowed to come into
their precincts without a special permit–for I was afraid of the
Church.</p>
<p>I had started a teacher-factory and a lot of Sunday-schools the first
thing; as a result, I now had an admirable system of graded schools in
full blast in those places, and also a complete variety of Protestant
congregations all in a prosperous and growing condition. Everybody could
be any kind of a Christian he wanted to; there was perfect freedom in
that matter. But I confined public religious teaching to the churches
and the Sunday-schools, permitting nothing of it in my other educational
buildings. I could have given my own sect the preference and made
everybody a Presbyterian without any trouble, but that would have been
to affront a law of human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as
various in the human family as are physical appetites, complexions, and
features, and a man is only at his best, morally, when he is equipped
with the religious garment whose color and shape and size most nicely
accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion, angularities, and
stature of the individual who wears it; and, besides, I was afraid of a
united Church; it makes a mighty power, the mightiest conceivable, and
then when it by and by gets into selfish hands, as it is always bound to
do, it means death to human liberty and paralysis to human thought.</p>
<p>All mines were royal property, and there were a good many of them.
They had formerly been worked as savages always work mines–holes grubbed
in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by hand, at the
rate of a ton a day; but I had begun to put the mining on a scientific
basis as early as I could.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made pretty handsome progress when Sir Sagramor’s
challenge struck me.</p>
<p>Four years rolled by–and then! Well, you would never imagine it in
the world. Unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in safe hands.
The despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect government. An
earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect earthly government, if
the conditions were the same, namely, the despot the perfectest
individual of the human race, and his lease of life perpetual. But as a
perishable perfect man must die, and leave his despotism in the hands of
an imperfect successor, an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of
government, it is the worst form that is possible.</p>
<p>My works showed what a despot could do with the resources of a
kingdom at his command. Unsuspected by this dark land, I had the
civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very nose! It
was fenced away from the public view, but there it was, a gigantic and
unassailable fact–and to be heard from, yet, if I lived and had luck.
There it was, as sure a fact and as substantial a fact as any serene
volcano, standing innocent with its smokeless summit in the blue sky and
giving no sign of the rising hell in its bowels. My schools and churches
were children four years before; they were grown-up now; my shops of
that day were vast factories now; where I had a dozen trained men then,
I had a thousand now; where I had one brilliant expert then, I had fifty
now. I stood with my hand on the cock, so to speak, ready to turn it on
and flood the midnight world with light at any moment. But I was not
going to do the thing in that sudden way. It was not my policy. The
people could not have stood it; and, moreover, I should have had the
Established Roman Catholic Church on my back in a minute.</p>
<p>No, I had been going cautiously all the while. I had had confidential
agents trickling through the country some time, whose office was to
undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees, and to gnaw a little at
this and that and the other superstition, and so prepare the way
gradually for a better order of things. I was turning on my light
one-candle-power at a time, and meant to continue to do so.</p>
<p>I had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom, and
they were doing very well. I meant to work this racket more and more, as
time wore on, if nothing occurred to frighten me. One of my deepest
secrets was my West Point–my military academy. I kept that most
jealously out of sight; and I did the same with my naval academy which I
had established at a remote seaport. Both were prospering to my
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Clarence was twenty-two now, and was my head executive, my right
hand. He was a darling; he was equal to anything; there wasn’t anything
he couldn’t turn his hand to. Of late I had been training him for
journalism, for the time seemed about right for a start in the newspaper
line; nothing big, but just a small weekly for experimental circulation
in my civilization-nurseries. He took to it like a duck; there was an
editor concealed in him, sure. Already he had doubled himself in one
way; he talked sixth century and wrote nineteenth. His journalistic
style was climbing, steadily; it was already up to the back settlement
Alabama mark, and couldn’t be told from the editorial output of that
region either by matter or flavor.</p>
<p>We had another large departure on hand, too. This was a telegraph and
a telephone; our first venture in this line. These wires were for
private service only, as yet, and must be kept private until a riper day
should come. We had a gang of men on the road, working mainly by night.
They were stringing ground wires; we were afraid to put up poles, for
they would attract too much inquiry. Ground wires were good enough, in
both instances, for my wires were protected by an insulation of my own
invention which was perfect. My men had orders to strike across country,
avoiding roads, and establishing connection with any considerable towns
whose lights betrayed their presence, and leaving experts in charge.
Nobody could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom, for nobody
ever went intentionally to any place, but only struck it by accident in
his wanderings, and then generally left it without thinking to inquire
what its name was. At one time and another we had sent out topographical
expeditions to survey and map the kingdom, but the priests had always
interfered and raised trouble. So we had given the thing up, for the
present; it would be poor wisdom to antagonize the Church.</p>
<p>As for the general condition of the country, it was as it had been
when I arrived in it, to all intents and purposes. I had made changes,
but they were necessarily slight, and they were not noticeable. Thus
far, I had not even meddled with taxation, outside of the taxes which
provided the royal revenues. I had systematized those, and put the
service on an effective and righteous basis. As a result, these revenues
were already quadrupled, and yet the burden was so much more equably
distributed than before, that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief,
and the praises of my administration were hearty and general.</p>
<p>Personally, I struck an interruption, now, but I did not mind it, it
could not have happened at a better time. Earlier it could have annoyed
me, but now everything was in good hands and swimming right along. The
king had reminded me several times, of late, that the postponement I had
asked for, four years before, had about run out now. It was a hint that
I ought to be starting out to seek adventures and get up a reputation of
a size to make me worthy of the honor of breaking a lance with Sir
Sagramor, who was still out grailing, but was being hunted for by
various relief expeditions, and might be found any year, now. So you see
I was expecting this interruption; it did not take me by surprise.</p>
