<h4 id="chapter-lxvii.">CHAPTER LXVII.</h4>
<p>First catch your Boer, then kick him. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New
Calendar.</p>
<p>Those latter days were days of bitter worry and trouble for the
harassed Reformers.</p>
<p>From Mrs. Hammond we learn that on the 31st (the day after
Johannesburg heard of the invasion), “The Reform Committee repudiates
Dr. Jameson’s inroad.“</p>
<p>It also publishes its intention to adhere to the Manifesto.</p>
<p>It also earnestly desires that the inhabitants shall refrain from
overt acts against the Boer government.</p>
<p>It also “distributes arms“ at the Court House, and furnishes horses
“to the newly-enrolled volunteers.“</p>
<p>It also brings a Transvaal flag into the committee-room, and the
entire body swear allegiance to it “with uncovered heads and upraised
arms.“</p>
<p>Also “one thousand Lee-Metford rifles have been given out“–to
rebels.</p>
<p>Also, in a speech, Reformer Lionel Phillips informs the public that
the Reform Committee Delegation has “been received with courtesy by the
Government Commission,“ and “been assured that their proposals shall be
earnestly considered.“ That “while the Reform Committee regretted
Jameson’s precipitate action, they would stand by him.“</p>
<p>Also the populace are in a state of “wild enthusiasm,“ and “46 can
scarcely be restrained; they want to go out to meet Jameson and bring
him in with triumphal outcry.“</p>
<p>Also the British High Commissioner has issued a damnifying
proclamation against Jameson and all British abettors of his game. It
arrives January 1st.</p>
<p>It is a difficult position for the Reformers, and full of hindrances
and perplexities. Their duty is hard, but plain:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>They have to repudiate the inroad, and stand by the
inroader.</p></li>
<li><p>They have to swear allegiance to the Boer government, and
distribute cavalry horses to the rebels.</p></li>
<li><p>They have to forbid overt acts against the Boer government, and
distribute arms to its enemies.</p></li>
<li><p>They have to avoid collision with the British government, but
still stand by Jameson and their new oath of allegiance to the Boer
government, taken, uncovered, in presence of its flag.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>They did such of these things as they could; they tried to do them
all; in fact, did do them all, but only in turn, not simultaneously. In
the nature of things they could not be made to simultane.</p>
<p>In preparing for armed revolution and in talking revolution, were the
Reformers “bluffing,“ or were they in earnest? If they were in earnest,
they were taking great risks–as has been already pointed out. A
gentleman of high position told me in Johannesburg that he had in his
possession a printed document proclaiming a new government and naming
its president–one of the Reform leaders. He said that this proclamation
had been ready for issue, but was suppressed when the raid collapsed.
Perhaps I misunderstood him. Indeed, I must have misunderstood him, for
I have not seen mention of this large incident in print anywhere.</p>
<p>Besides, I hope I am mistaken; for, if I am, then there is argument
that the Reformers were privately not serious, but were only trying to
scare the Boer government into granting the desired reforms.</p>
<p>The Boer government was scared, and it had a right to be. For if
Mr. Rhodes’s plan was to provoke a collision that would compel the
interference of England, that was a serious matter. If it could be shown
that that was also the Reformers’ plan and purpose, it would prove that
they had marked out a feasible project, at any rate, although it was one
which could hardly fail to cost them ruinously before England should
arrive. But it seems clear that they had no such plan nor desire. If,
when the worst should come to the worst, they meant to overthrow the
government, they also meant to inherit the assets themselves, no
doubt.</p>
<p>This scheme could hardly have succeeded. With an army of Boers at
their gates and 50,000 riotous blacks in their midst, the odds against
success would have been too heavy–even if the whole town had been armed.
With only 2,500 rifles in the place, they stood really no chance.</p>
<p>To me, the military problems of the situation are of more interest
than the political ones, because by disposition I have always been
especially fond of war. No, I mean fond of discussing war; and fond of
giving military advice. If I had been with Jameson the morning after he
started, I should have advised him to turn back. That was Monday; it was
then that he received his first warning from a Boer source not to
violate the friendly soil of the Transvaal. It showed that his invasion
was known. If I had been with him on Tuesday morning and afternoon, when
he received further warnings, I should have repeated my advice. If I had
been with him the next morning–New Year’s–when he received notice that
“a few hundred“ Boers were waiting for him a few miles ahead, I should
not have advised, but commanded him to go back. And if I had been with
him two or three hours later–a thing not conceivable to me–I should have
retired him by force; for at that time he learned that the few hundred
had now grown to 800; and that meant that the growing would go on
growing.</p>
<p>For,–by authority of Mr. Garrett, one knows that Jameson’s 600 were
only 530 at most, when you count out his native drivers, etc.; and that
the 530 consisted largely of “green“ youths, “raw young fellows,“ not
trained and war-worn British soldiers; and I would have told. Jameson
that those lads would not be able to shoot effectively from horseback in
the scamper and racket of battle, and that there would not be anything
for them to shoot at, anyway, but rocks; for the Boers would be behind
the rocks, not out in the open. I would have told him that 300 Boer
sharpshooters behind rocks would be an overmatch for his 500 raw young
fellows on horseback.</p>
<p>If pluck were the only thing essential to battle-winning, the English
would lose no battles. But discretion, as well as pluck, is required
when one fights Boers and Red Indians. In South Africa the Briton has
always insisted upon standing bravely up, unsheltered, before the hidden
Boer, and taking the results: Jameson’s men would follow the custom.
Jameson would not have listened to me–he would have been intent upon
repeating history, according to precedent. Americans are not acquainted
with the British-Boer war of 1881; but its history is interesting, and
could have been instructive to Jameson if he had been receptive. I will
cull some details of it from trustworthy sources mainly from “Russell’s
Natal.“ Mr. Russell is not a Boer, but a Briton. He is inspector of
schools, and his history is a text-book whose purpose is the instruction
of the Natal English youth.</p>
<p>After the seizure of the Transvaal and the suppression of the Boer
government by England in 1877, the Boers fretted for three years, and
made several appeals to England for a restoration of their liberties,
but without result. Then they gathered themselves together in a great
mass-meeting at Krugersdorp, talked their troubles over, and resolved to
fight for their deliverance from the British yoke. (Krugersdorp–the
place where the Boers interrupted the Jameson raid.) The little handful
of farmers rose against the strongest empire in the world. They
proclaimed martial law and the re-establishment of their Republic. They
organized their forces and sent them forward to intercept the British
battalions. This, although Sir Garnet Wolseley had but lately made
proclamation that “so long as the sun shone in the heavens,“ the
Transvaal would be and remain English territory. And also in spite of
the fact that the commander of the 94th regiment–already on the march to
suppress this rebellion–had been heard to say that “the Boers would turn
tail at the first beat of the big drum.“–[“South Africa As It Is,“ by F.
Reginald Statham, page 82. London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1897.]</p>
<p>Four days after the flag-raising, the Boer force which had been sent
forward to forbid the invasion of the English troops met them at
Bronkhorst Spruit–246 men of the 94th regiment, in command of a colonel,
the big drum beating, the band playing–and the first battle was fought.
It lasted ten minutes. Result:</p>
<p>British loss, more than 150 officers and men, out of the 246.
Surrender of the remnant.</p>
<p>Boer loss–if any–not stated.</p>
<p>They are fine marksmen, the Boers. From the cradle up, they live on
horseback and hunt wild animals with the rifle. They have a passion for
liberty and the Bible, and care for nothing else.</p>
<p>“General Sir George Colley, Lieutenant-Governor and
Commander-in-Chief in Natal, felt it his duty to proceed at once to the
relief of the loyalists and soldiers beleaguered in the different towns
of the Transvaal.“ He moved out with 1,000 men and some artillery. He
found the Boers encamped in a strong and sheltered position on high
ground at Laing’s Nek–every Boer behind a rock. Early in the morning of
the 28th January, 1881, he moved to the attack “with the 58th regiment,
commanded by Colonel Deane, a mounted squadron of 70 men, the 60th
Rifles, the Naval Brigade with three rocket tubes, and the Artillery
with six guns.“ He shelled the Boers for twenty minutes, then the
assault was delivered, the 58th marching up the slope in solid column.
The battle was soon finished, with this result, according to
Russell–</p>
<p>British loss in killed and wounded, 174.</p>
<p>Boer loss, “trifling.“</p>
<p>Colonel Deane was killed, and apparently every officer above the
grade of lieutenant was killed or wounded, for the 58th retreated to its
camp in command of a lieutenant. (“Africa as It Is.“)</p>
<p>That ended the second battle.</p>
<p>On the 7th of February General Colley discovered that the Boers were
flanking his position. The next morning he left his camp at Mount
Pleasant and marched out and crossed the Ingogo river with 270 men,
started up the Ingogo heights, and there fought a battle which lasted
from noon till nightfall. He then retreated, leaving his wounded with
his military chaplain, and in recrossing the now swollen river lost some
of his men by drowning. That was the third Boer victory. Result,
according to Mr. Russell–</p>
<p>British loss 150 out of 270 engaged.</p>
<p>Boer loss, 8 killed, 9 wounded–17.</p>
<p>There was a season of quiet, now, but at the end of about three weeks
Sir George Colley conceived the idea of climbing, with an infantry and
artillery force, the steep and rugged mountain of Amajuba in the night–a
bitter hard task, but he accomplished it. On the way he left about 200
men to guard a strategic point, and took about 400 up the mountain with
him. When the sun rose in the morning, there was an unpleasant surprise
for the Boers; yonder were the English troops visible on top of the
mountain two or three miles away, and now their own position was at the
mercy of the English artillery. The Boer chief resolved to retreat–up
that mountain. He asked for volunteers, and got them.</p>
<p>The storming party crossed the swale and began to creep up the
steeps, “and from behind rocks and bushes they shot at the soldiers on
the skyline as if they were stalking deer,“ says Mr. Russell. There was
“continuous musketry fire, steady and fatal on the one side, wild and
ineffectual on the other.“ The Boers reached the top, and began to put
in their ruinous work. Presently the British “broke and fled for their
lives down the rugged steep.“ The Boers had won the battle. Result in
killed and wounded, including among the killed the British General:</p>
<p>British loss, 226, out of 400 engaged.</p>
<p>Boer loss, 1 killed, 5 wounded.</p>
<p>That ended the war. England listened to reason, and recognized the
Boer Republic–a government which has never been in any really awful
danger since, until Jameson started after it with his 500 “raw young
fellows.“ To recapitulate:</p>
<p>The Boer farmers and British soldiers fought 4 battles, and the Boers
won them all. Result of the 4, in killed and wounded:</p>
<p>British loss, 700 men.</p>
<p>Boer loss, so far as known, 23 men.</p>
<p>It is interesting, now, to note how loyally Jameson and his several
trained British military officers tried to make their battles conform to
precedent. Mr. Garrett’s account of the Raid is much the best one I have
met with, and my impressions of the Raid are drawn from that.</p>
<p>When Jameson learned that near Krugersdorp he would find 800 Boers
waiting to dispute his passage, he was not in the least disturbed. He
was feeling as he had felt two or three days before, when he had opened
his campaign with a historic remark to the same purport as the one with
which the commander of the 94th had opened the Boer-British war of
fourteen years before. That Commander’s remark was, that the Boers
“would turn tail at the first beat of the big drum.“ Jameson’s was, that
with his “raw young fellows“ he could kick the (persons) of the Boers
“all round the Transvaal.“ He was keeping close to historic
precedent.</p>
<p>Jameson arrived in the presence of the Boers. They–according to
precedent–were not visible. It was a country of ridges, depressions,
rocks, ditches, moraines of mining-tailings–not even as favorable for
cavalry work as Laing’s Nek had been in the former disastrous days.
Jameson shot at the ridges and rocks with his artillery, just as General
Colley had done at the Nek; and did them no damage and persuaded no Boer
to show himself. Then about a hundred of his men formed up to charge the
ridge-according to the 58th’s precedent at the Nek; but as they dashed
forward they opened out in a long line, which was a considerable
improvement on the 58th’s tactics; when they had gotten to within 200
yards of the ridge the concealed Boers opened out on them and emptied 20
saddles. The unwounded dismounted and fired at the rocks over the backs
of their horses; but the return-fire was too hot, and they mounted
again, “and galloped back or crawled away into a clump of reeds for
cover, where they were shortly afterward taken prisoners as they lay
among the reeds. Some thirty prisoners were so taken, and during the
night which followed the Boers carried away another thirty killed and
wounded–the wounded to Krugersdorp hospital.“ Sixty per cent. of the
assaulted force disposed of–according to Mr. Garrett’s estimate.</p>
<p>It was according to Amajuba precedent, where the British loss was 226
out of about 400 engaged.</p>
<p>Also, in Jameson’s camp, that night, “there lay about 30 wounded or
otherwise disabled“ men. Also during the night “some 30 or 40 young
fellows got separated from the command and straggled through into
Johannesburg.“ Altogether a possible 150 men gone, out of his 530. His
lads had fought valorously, but had not been able to get near enough to
a Boer to kick him around the Transvaal.</p>
<p>At dawn the next morning the column of something short of 400 whites
resumed its march. Jameson’s grit was stubbornly good; indeed, it was
always that. He still had hopes. There was a long and tedious zigzagging
march through broken ground, with constant harassment from the Boers;
and at last the column “walked into a sort of trap,“ and the Boers
“closed in upon it.“ “Men and horses dropped on all sides. In the column
the feeling grew that unless it could burst through the Boer lines at
this point it was done for. The Maxims were fired until they grew too
hot, and, water failing for the cool jacket, five of them jammed and
went out of action. The 7-pounder was fired until only half an hour’s
ammunition was left to fire with. One last rush was made, and failed,
and then the Staats Artillery came up on the left flank, and the game
was up.“</p>
<p>Jameson hoisted a white flag and surrendered.</p>
<p>There is a story, which may not be true, about an ignorant Boer
farmer there who thought that this white flag was the national flag of
England. He had been at Bronkhorst, and Laing’s Nek, and Ingogo and
Amajuba, and supposed that the English did not run up their flag
excepting at the end of a fight.</p>
<p>The following is (as I understand it) Mr. Garrett’s estimate of
Jameson’s total loss in killed and wounded for the two days:</p>
<p>“When they gave in they were minus some 20 per cent. of combatants.
There were 76 casualties. There were 30 men hurt or sick in the wagons.
There were 27 killed on the spot or mortally wounded.“</p>
<p>Total, 133, out of the original 530. It is just 25 per
cent.–[However, I judge that the total was really 150; for the number of
wounded carried to Krugersdorp hospital was 53; not 30, as Mr. Garrett
reports it. The lady whose guest I was in Krugerdorp gave me the
figures. She was head nurse from the beginning of hostilities (Jan. 1)
until the professional nurses arrived, Jan. 8th. Of the 53, “Three or
four were Boers“; I quote her words.]–This is a large improvement upon
the precedents established at Bronkhorst, Laing’s Nek, Ingogo, and
Amajuba, and seems to indicate that Boer marksmanship is not so good now
as it was in those days. But there is one detail in which the
Raid-episode exactly repeats history. By surrender at Bronkhorst, the
whole British force disappeared from the theater of war; this was the
case with Jameson’s force.</p>
<p>In the Boer loss, also, historical precedent is followed with
sufficient fidelity. In the 4 battles named above, the Boer loss, so far
as known, was an average of 6 men per battle, to the British average
loss of 175. In Jameson’s battles, as per Boer official report, the Boer
loss in killed was 4. Two of these were killed by the Boers themselves,
by accident, the other by Jameson’s army–one of them intentionally, the
other by a pathetic mischance. “A young Boer named Jacobz was moving
forward to give a drink to one of the wounded troopers (Jameson’s) after
the first charge, when another wounded man, mistaking his intention;
shot him.“ There were three or four wounded Boers in the Krugersdorp
hospital, and apparently no others have been reported. Mr. Garrett, “on
a balance of probabilities, fully accepts the official version, and
thanks Heaven the killed was not larger.“</p>
<p>As a military man, I wish to point out what seems to me to be
military errors in the conduct of the campaign which we have just been
considering. I have seen active service in the field, and it was in the
actualities of war that I acquired my training and my right to speak. I
served two weeks in the beginning of our Civil War, and during all that
tune commanded a battery of infantry composed of twelve men. General
Grant knew the history of my campaign, for I told it him. I also told
him the principle upon which I had conducted it; which was, to tire the
enemy. I tired out and disqualified many battalions, yet never had a
casualty myself nor lost a man. General Grant was not given to paying
compliments, yet he said frankly that if I had conducted the whole war
much bloodshed would have been spared, and that what the army might have
lost through the inspiriting results of collision in the field would
have been amply made up by the liberalizing influences of travel.
Further endorsement does not seem to me to be necessary.</p>
<p>Let us now examine history, and see what it teaches. In the 4 battles
fought in 1881 and the two fought by Jameson, the British loss in
killed, wounded, and prisoners, was substantially 1,300 men; the Boer
loss, as far as is ascertainable, eras about 30 men. These figures show
that there was a defect somewhere. It was not in the absence of courage.
I think it lay in the absence of discretion. The Briton should have done
one thing or the other: discarded British methods and fought the Boer
with Boer methods, or augmented his own force until–using British
methods–it should be large enough to equalize results with the Boer.</p>
<p>To retain the British method requires certain things, determinable by
arithmetic. If, for argument’s sake, we allow that the aggregate of
1,716 British soldiers engaged in the 4 early battles was opposed by the
same aggregate of Boers, we have this result: the British loss of 700
and the Boer loss of 23 argues that in order to equalize results in
future battles you must make the British force thirty times as strong as
the Boer force. Mr. Garrett shows that the Boer force immediately
opposed to Jameson was 2,000, and that there were 6,000 more on hand by
the evening of the second day. Arithmetic shows that in order to make
himself the equal of the 8,000 Boers, Jameson should have had 240,000
men, whereas he merely had 530 boys. From a military point of view,
backed by the facts of history, I conceive that Jameson’s military
judgment was at fault.</p>
<p>Another thing.–Jameson was encumbered by artillery, ammunition, and
rifles. The facts of the battle show that he should have had none of
those things along. They were heavy, they were in his way, they impeded
his march. There was nothing to shoot at but rocks–he knew quite well
that there would be nothing to shoot at but rocks–and he knew that
artillery and rifles have no effect upon rocks. He was badly overloaded
with unessentials. He had 8 Maxims–a Maxim is a kind of Gatling, I
believe, and shoots about 500 bullets per minute; he had one 12
1/2-pounder cannon and two 7-pounders; also, 145,000 rounds of
ammunition. He worked the Maxims so hard upon the rocks that five of
them became disabled–five of the Maxims, not the rocks. It is believed
that upwards of 100,000 rounds of ammunition of the various kinds were
fired during the 21 hours that the battles lasted. One man killed. He
must have been much mutilated. It was a pity to bring those futile
Maxims along. Jameson should have furnished himself with a battery of
Pudd’nhead Wilson maxims instead, They are much more deadly than those
others, and they are easily carried, because they have no weight.</p>
<p>Mr. Garrett–not very carefully concealing a smile–excuses the
presence of the Maxims by saying that they were of very substantial use
because their sputtering disordered the aim of the Boers, and in that
way saved lives.</p>
<p>Three cannon, eight Maxims, and five hundred rifles yielded a result
which emphasized a fact which had already been established–that the
British system of standing out in the open to fight Boers who are behind
rocks is not wise, not excusable, and ought to be abandoned for
something more efficacious. For the purpose of war is to kill, not
merely to waste ammunition.</p>
<p>If I could get the management of one of those campaigns, I would know
what to do, for I have studied the Boer. He values the Bible above every
other thing. The most delicious edible in South Africa is “biltong.“ You
will have seen it mentioned in Olive Schreiner’s books. It is what our
plainsmen call “jerked beef.“ It is the Boer’s main standby. He has a
passion for it, and he is right.</p>
<p>If I had the command of the campaign I would go with rifles only, no
cumbersome Maxims and cannon to spoil good rocks with. I would move
surreptitiously by night to a point about a quarter of a mile from the
Boer camp, and there I would build up a pyramid of biltong and Bibles
fifty feet high, and then conceal my men all about. In the morning the
Boers would send out spies, and then the rest would come with a rush. I
would surround them, and they would have to fight my men on equal terms,
in the open. There wouldn’t be any Amajuba results.</p>
<p>–[Just as I am finishing this book an unfortunate dispute has sprung
up between Dr. Jameson and his officers, on the one hand, and Colonel
Rhodes on the other, concerning the wording of a note which Colonel
Rhodes sent from Johannesburg by a cyclist to Jameson just before
hostilities began on the memorable New Year’s Day. Some of the fragments
of this note were found on the battlefield after the fight, and these
have been pieced together; the dispute is as to what words the lacking
fragments contained. Jameson says the note promised him a reinforcement
of 300 men from Johannesburg. Colonel Rhodes denies this, and says he
merely promised to send out “some“ men “to meet you.“]</p>
<p>[It seems a pity that these friends should fall out over so little a
thing. If the 300 had been sent, what good would it have done? In 21
hours of industrious fighting, Jameson’s 530 men, with 8 Maxims, 3
cannon, and 145,000 rounds of ammunition, killed an aggregate of 1.
Boer. These statistics show that a reinforcement of 300 Johannesburgers,
armed merely with muskets, would have killed, at the outside, only a
little over a half of another Boer. This would not have saved the day.
It would not even have seriously affected the general result. The
figures show clearly, and with mathematical violence, that the only way
to save Jameson, or even give him a fair and equal chance with the
enemy, was for Johannesburg to send him 240 Maxims, 90 cannon, 600
carloads of ammunition, and 240,000 men. Johannesburg was not in a
position to do this. Johannesburg has been called very hard names for
not reinforcing Jameson. But in every instance this has been done by two
classes of persons–people who do not read history, and people, like
Jameson, who do not understand what it means, after they have read
it.]</p>
