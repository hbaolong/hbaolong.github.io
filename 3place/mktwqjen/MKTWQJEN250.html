<h4 id="the-approaching-epidemic">THE APPROACHING EPIDEMIC</h4>
<p>One calamity to which the death of Mr. Dickens dooms this country has
not awakened the concern to which its gravity entitles it. We refer to
the fact that the nation is to be lectured to death and read to death
all next winter, by Tom, Dick, and Harry, with poor lamented Dickens for
a pretext. All the vagabonds who can spell will afflict the people with
“readings“ from Pickwick and Copperfield, and all the insignificants who
have been ennobled by the notice of the great novelist or transfigured
by his smile will make a marketable commodity of it now, and turn the
sacred reminiscence to the practical use of procuring bread and butter.
The lecture rostrums will fairly swarm with these fortunates. Already
the signs of it are perceptible. Behold how the unclean creatures are
wending toward the dead lion and gathering to the feast:</p>
<p>“Reminiscences of Dickens.“ A lecture. By John Smith, who heard him
read eight times.</p>
<p>“Remembrances of Charles Dickens.“ A lecture. By John Jones, who saw
him once in a street car and twice in a barber shop.</p>
<p>“Recollections of Mr. Dickens.“ A lecture. By John Brown, who gained
a wide fame by writing deliriously appreciative critiques and rhapsodies
upon the great author’s public readings; and who shook hands with the
great author upon various occasions, and held converse with him several
times.</p>
<p>“Readings from Dickens.“ By John White, who has the great
delineator’s style and manner perfectly, having attended all his
readings in this country and made these things a study, always
practising each reading before retiring, and while it was hot from the
great delineator’s lips. Upon this occasion Mr. W. will exhibit the
remains of a cigar which he saw Mr. Dickens smoke. This Relic is kept in
a solid silver box made purposely for it.</p>
<p>“Sights and Sounds of the Great Novelist.“ A popular lecture. By John
Gray, who waited on his table all the time he was at the Grand Hotel,
New York, and still has in his possession and will exhibit to the
audience a fragment of the Last Piece of Bread which the lamented author
tasted in this country.</p>
<p>“Heart Treasures of Precious Moments with Literature’s Departed
Monarch.“ A lecture. By Miss Serena Amelia Tryphenia McSpadden, who
still wears, and will always wear, a glove upon the hand made sacred by
the clasp of Dickens. Only Death shall remove it.</p>
<p>“Readings from Dickens.“ By Mrs. J. O’Hooligan Murphy, who washed for
him.</p>
<p>“Familiar Talks with the Great Author.“ A narrative lecture. By John
Thomas, for two weeks his valet in America.</p>
<p>And so forth, and so on. This isn’t half the list. The man who has a
“Toothpick once used by Charles Dickens“ will have to have a hearing;
and the man who “once rode in an omnibus with Charles Dickens;“ and the
lady to whom Charles Dickens “granted the hospitalities of his umbrella
during a storm;“ and the person who “possesses a hole which once
belonged in a handkerchief owned by Charles Dickens.“ Be patient and
long-suffering, good people, for even this does not fill up the measure
of what you must endure next winter. There is no creature in all this
land who has had any personal relations with the late Mr. Dickens,
however slight or trivial, but will shoulder his way to the rostrum and
inflict his testimony upon his helpless countrymen. To some people it is
fatal to be noticed by greatness.</p>
