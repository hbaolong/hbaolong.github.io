<h4 id="chapter-xliii.">CHAPTER XLIII.</h4>
<p>Hunger is the handmaid of genius –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New
Calendar.</p>
<p>One day during our stay in Bombay there was a criminal trial of a
most interesting sort, a terribly realistic chapter out of the “Arabian
Nights,“ a strange mixture of simplicities and pieties and murderous
practicalities, which brought back the forgotten days of Thuggee and
made them live again; in fact, even made them believable. It was a case
where a young girl had been assassinated for the sake of her trifling
ornaments, things not worth a laborer’s day’s wages in America. This
thing could have been done in many other countries, but hardly with the
cold business-like depravity, absence of fear, absence of caution,
destitution of the sense of horror, repentance, remorse, exhibited in
this case. Elsewhere the murderer would have done his crime secretly, by
night, and without witnesses; his fears would have allowed him no peace
while the dead body was in his neighborhood; he would not have rested
until he had gotten it safe out of the way and hidden as effectually as
he could hide it. But this Indian murderer does his deed in the full
light of day, cares nothing for the society of witnesses, is in no way
incommoded by the presence of the corpse, takes his own time about
disposing of it, and the whole party are so indifferent, so phlegmatic,
that they take their regular sleep as if nothing was happening and no
halters hanging over them; and these five bland people close the episode
with a religious service. The thing reads like a Meadows-Taylor
Thug-tale of half a century ago, as may be seen by the official report
of the trial:</p>
<p>“At the Mazagon Police Court yesterday, Superintendent Nolan again
charged Tookaram Suntoo Savat Baya, woman, her daughter Krishni, and
Gopal Yithoo Bhanayker, before Mr. Phiroze Hoshang Dastur, Fourth
Presidency Magistrate, under sections 302 and 109 of the Code, with
having on the night of the 30th of December last murdered a Hindoo girl
named Cassi, aged 12, by strangulation, in the room of a chawl at
Jakaria Bunder, on the Sewriroad, and also with aiding and abetting each
other in the commission of the offense.</p>
<p>“Mr. F. A. Little, Public Prosecutor, conducted the case on behalf of
the Crown, the accused being undefended.</p>
<p>“Mr. Little applied under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure
Code to tender pardon to one of the accused, Krishni, woman, aged 22, on
her undertaking to make a true and full statement of facts under which
the deceased girl Cassi was murdered.</p>
<p>“The Magistrate having granted the Public Prosecutor’s application,
the accused Krishni went into the witness-box, and, on being examined by
Mr. Little, made the following confession:–I am a mill-hand employed at
the Jubilee Mill. I recollect the day (Tuesday); on which the body of
the deceased Cassi was found. Previous to that I attended the mill for
half a day, and then returned home at 3 in the afternoon, when I saw
five persons in the house, viz.: the first accused Tookaram, who is my
paramour, my mother, the second accused Baya, the accused Gopal, and two
guests named Ramji Daji and Annaji Gungaram. Tookaram rented the room of
the chawl situated at Jakaria Bunder-road from its owner, Girdharilal
Radhakishan, and in that room I, my paramour, Tookaram, and his younger
brother, Yesso Mahadhoo, live. Since his arrival in Bombay from his
native country Yesso came and lived with us. When I returned from the
mill on the afternoon of that day, I saw the two guests seated on a cot
in the veranda, and a few minutes after the accused Gopal came and took
his seat by their side, while I and my mother were seated inside the
room. Tookaram, who had gone out to fetch some ‘pan’ and betelnuts, on
his return home had brought the two guests with him. After returning
home he gave them ‘pan supari’. While they were eating it my mother came
out of the room and inquired of one of the guests, Ramji, what had
happened to his foot, when he replied that he had tried many remedies,
but they had done him no good. My mother then took some rice in her hand
and prophesied that the disease which Ramji was suffering from would not
be cured until he returned to his native country. In the meantime the
deceased Casi came from the direction of an out-house, and stood in
front on the threshold of our room with a ‘lota’ in her hand. Tookaram
then told his two guests to leave the room, and they then went up the
steps towards the quarry. After the guests had gone away, Tookaram
seized the deceased, who had come into the room, and he afterwards put a
waistband around her, and tied her to a post which supports a loft.
After doing this, he pressed the girl’s throat, and, having tied her
mouth with the ‘dhotur’ (now shown in Court), fastened it to the post.
Having killed the girl, Tookaram removed her gold head ornament and a
gold ‘putlee’, and also took charge of her ‘lota’. Besides these two
ornaments Cassi had on her person ear-studs a nose-ring, some silver
toe-rings, two necklaces, a pair of silver anklets and bracelets.
Tookaram afterwards tried to remove the silver amulets, the ear-studs,
and the nose-ring; but he failed in his attempt. While he was doing so,
I, my mother, and Gopal were present. After removing the two gold
ornaments, he handed them over to Gopal, who was at the time standing
near me. When he killed Cassi, Tookaram threatened to strangle me also
if I informed any one of this. Gopal and myself were then standing at
the door of our room, and we both were threatened by Tookaram. My
mother, Baya, had seized the legs of the deceased at the time she was
killed, and whilst she was being tied to the post. Cassi then made a
noise. Tookaram and my mother took part in killing the girl. After the
murder her body was wrapped up in a mattress and kept on the loft over
the door of our room. When Cassi was strangled, the door of the room was
fastened from the inside by Tookaram. This deed was committed shortly
after my return home from work in the mill. Tookaram put the body of the
deceased in the mattress, and, after it was left on the loft, he went to
have his head shaved by a barber named Sambhoo Raghoo, who lives only
one door away from me. My mother and myself then remained in the
possession of the information. I was slapped and threatened by my
paramour, Tookaram, and that was the only reason why I did not inform
any one at that time. When I told Tookaram that I would give information
of the occurrence, he slapped me. The accused Gopal was asked by
Tookaram to go back to his room, and he did so, taking away with him the
two gold ornaments and the ‘lota’. Yesso Mahadhoo, a brother-in-law of
Tookaram, came to the house and asked Taokaram why he was washing, the
water-pipe being just opposite. Tookaram replied that he was washing his
dhotur, as a fowl had polluted it. About 6 o’clock of the evening of
that day my mother gave me three pice and asked me to buy a cocoanut,
and I gave the money to Yessoo, who went and fetched a cocoanut and some
betel leaves. When Yessoo and others were in the room I was bathing,
and, after I finished my bath, my mother took the cocoanut and the betel
leaves from Yessoo, and we five went to the sea. The party consisted of
Tookaram, my mother, Yessoo, Tookaram’s younger brother, and myself. On
reaching the seashore, my mother made the offering to the sea, and
prayed to be pardoned for what we had done. Before we went to the sea,
some one came to inquire after the girl Cassi. The police and other
people came to make these inquiries both before and after we left the
house for the seashore. The police questioned my mother about the girl,
and she replied that Cassi had come to her door, but had left. The next
day the police questioned Tookaram, and he, too, gave a similar reply.
This was said the same night when the search was made for the girl.
After the offering was made to the sea, we partook of the cocoanut and
returned home, when my mother gave me some food; but Tookaram did not
partake of any food that night. After dinner I and my mother slept
inside the room, and Tookaram slept on a cot near his brother-in-law,
Yessoo Mahadhoo, just outside the door. That was not the usual place
where Tookaram slept. He usually slept inside the room. The body of the
deceased remained on the loft when I went to sleep. The room in which we
slept was locked, and I heard that my paramour, Tookaram, was restless
outside. About 3 o’clock the following morning Tookaram knocked at the
door, when both myself and my mother opened it. He then told me to go to
the steps leading to the quarry, and see if any one was about. Those
steps lead to a stable, through which we go to the quarry at the back of
the compound. When I got to the steps I saw no one there. Tookaram asked
me if any one was there, and I replied that I could see no one about. He
then took the body of the deceased from the loft, and having wrapped it
up in his saree, asked me to accompany him to the steps of the quarry,
and I did so. The ‘saree’ now produced here was the same. Besides the
‘saree’, there was also a ‘cholee’ on the body. He then carried the body
in his arms, and went up the steps, through the stable, and then to the
right hand towards a Sahib’s bungalow, where Tookaram placed the body
near a wall. All the time I and my mother were with him. When the body
was taken down, Yessoo was lying on the cot. After depositing the body
under the wall, we all returned home, and soon after 5 a.m. the police
again came and took Tookaram away. About an hour after they returned and
took me and my mother away. We were questioned about it, when I made a
statement. Two hours later I was taken to the room, and I pointed out
this waistband, the ‘dhotur’, the mattress, and the wooden post to
Superintendent Nolan and Inspectors Roberts and Rashanali, in the
presence of my mother and Tookaram. Tookaram killed the girl Cassi for
her ornaments, which he wanted for the girl to whom he was shortly going
to be married. The body was found in the same place where it was
deposited by Tookaram.“</p>
<p>The criminal side of the native has always been picturesque, always
readable. The Thuggee and one or two other particularly outrageous
features of it have been suppressed by the English, but there is enough
of it left to keep it darkly interesting. One finds evidence of these
survivals in the newspapers. Macaulay has a light-throwing passage upon
this matter in his great historical sketch of Warren Hastings, where he
is describing some effects which followed the temporary paralysis of
Hastings’ powerful government brought about by Sir Philip Francis and
his party:</p>
<p>“The natives considered Hastings as a fallen man; and they acted
after their kind. Some of our readers may have seen, in India, a cloud
of crows pecking a sick vulture to death–no bad type of what happens in
that country as often as fortune deserts one who has been great and
dreaded. In an instant all the sycophants, who had lately been ready to
lie for him, to forge for him, to pander for him, to poison for him,
hasten to purchase the favor of his victorious enemies by accusing him.
An Indian government has only to let it be understood that it wishes a
particular man to be ruined, and in twenty-four hours it will be
furnished with grave charges, supported by depositions so full and
circumstantial that any person unaccustomed to Asiatic mendacity would
regard them as decisive. It is well if the signature of the destined
victim is not counterfeited at the foot of some illegal compact, and if
some treasonable paper is not slipped into a hiding-place in his
house.“</p>
<p>That was nearly a century and a quarter ago. An article in one of the
chief journals of India (the Pioneer) shows that in some respects the
native of to-day is just what his ancestor was then. Here are niceties
of so subtle and delicate a sort that they lift their breed of rascality
to a place among the fine arts, and almost entitle it to respect:</p>
<p>“The records of the Indian courts might certainly be relied upon to
prove that swindlers as a class in the East come very close to, if they
do not surpass, in brilliancy of execution and originality of design the
most expert of their fraternity in Europe and America. India in especial
is the home of forgery. There are some particular districts which are
noted as marts for the finest specimens of the forger’s handiwork. The
business is carried on by firms who possess stores of stamped papers to
suit every emergency. They habitually lay in a store of fresh stamped
papers every year, and some of the older and more thriving houses can
supply documents for the past forty years, bearing the proper water-mark
and possessing the genuine appearance of age. Other districts have
earned notoriety for skilled perjury, a pre-eminence that excites a
respectful admiration when one thinks of the universal prevalence of the
art, and persons desirous of succeeding in false suits are ready to pay
handsomely to avail themselves of the services of these local experts as
witnesses.“</p>
<p>Various instances illustrative of the methods of these swindlers are
given. They exhibit deep cunning and total depravity on the part of the
swindler and his pals, and more obtuseness on the part of the victim
than one would expect to find in a country where suspicion of your
neighbor must surely be one of the earliest things learned. The favorite
subject is the young fool who has just come into a fortune and is trying
to see how poor a use he can put it to. I will quote one example:</p>
<p>“Sometimes another form of confidence trick is adopted, which is
invariably successful. The particular pigeon is spotted, and, his
acquaintance having been made, he is encouraged in every form of vice.
When the friendship is thoroughly established, the swindler remarks to
the young man that he has a brother who has asked him to lend him
Rs.10,000. The swindler says he has the money and would lend it; but, as
the borrower is his brother, he cannot charge interest. So he proposes
that he should hand the dupe the money, and the latter should lend it to
the swindler’s brother, exacting a heavy pre-payment of interest which,
it is pointed out, they may equally enjoy in dissipation. The dupe sees
no objection, and on the appointed day receives Rs.7,000 from the
swindler, which he hands over to the confederate. The latter is profuse
in his thanks, and executes a promissory note for Rs.10,000, payable to
bearer. The swindler allows the scheme to remain quiescent for a time,
and then suggests that, as the money has not been repaid and as it would
be unpleasant to sue his brother, it would be better to sell the note in
the bazaar. The dupe hands the note over, for the money he advanced was
not his, and, on being informed that it would be necessary to have his
signature on the back so as to render the security negotiable, he signs
without any hesitation. The swindler passes it on to confederates, and
the latter employ a respectable firm of solicitors to ask the dupe if
his signature is genuine. He admits it at once, and his fate is sealed.
A suit is filed by a confederate against the dupe, two accomplices being
made co-defendants. They admit their Signatures as indorsers, and the
one swears he bought the note for value from the dupe. The latter has no
defense, for no court would believe the apparently idle explanation of
the manner in which he came to endorse the note.“</p>
<p>There is only one India! It is the only country that has a monopoly
of grand and imposing specialties. When another country has a remarkable
thing, it cannot have it all to itself–some other country has a
duplicate. But India–that is different. Its marvels are its own; the
patents cannot be infringed; imitations are not possible. And think of
the size of them, the majesty of them, the weird and outlandish
character of the most of them!</p>
<p>There is the Plague, the Black Death: India invented it; India is the
cradle of that mighty birth.</p>
<p>The Car of Juggernaut was India’s invention.</p>
<p>So was the Suttee; and within the time of men still living eight
hundred widows willingly, and, in fact, rejoicingly, burned themselves
to death on the bodies of their dead husbands in a single year. Eight
hundred would do it this year if the British government would let
them.</p>
<p>Famine is India’s specialty. Elsewhere famines are inconsequential
incidents–in India they are devastating cataclysms; in one case they
annihilate hundreds; in the other, millions.</p>
<p>India had 2,000,000 gods, and worships them all. In religion all
other countries are paupers; India is the only millionaire.</p>
<p>With her everything is on a giant scale–even her poverty; no other
country can show anything to compare with it. And she has been used to
wealth on so vast a scale that she has to shorten to single words the
expressions describing great sums. She describes 100,000 with one word
–a ‘lahk’; she describes ten millions with one word–a ‘crore’.</p>
<p>In the bowels of the granite mountains she has patiently carved out
dozens of vast temples, and made them glorious with sculptured
colonnades and stately groups of statuary, and has adorned the eternal
walls with noble paintings. She has built fortresses of such magnitude
that the show-strongholds of the rest of the world are but modest little
things by comparison; palaces that are wonders for rarity of materials,
delicacy and beauty of workmanship, and for cost; and one tomb which men
go around the globe to see. It takes eighty nations, speaking eighty
languages, to people her, and they number three hundred millions.</p>
<p>On top of all this she is the mother and home of that wonder of
wonders caste–and of that mystery of mysteries, the satanic brotherhood
of the Thugs.</p>
<p>India had the start of the whole world in the beginning of things.
She had the first civilization; she had the first accumulation of
material wealth; she was populous with deep thinkers and subtle
intellects; she had mines, and woods, and a fruitful soil. It would seem
as if she should have kept the lead, and should be to-day not the meek
dependent of an alien master, but mistress of the world, and delivering
law and command to every tribe and nation in it. But, in truth, there
was never any possibility of such supremacy for her. If there had been
but one India and one language–but there were eighty of them! Where
there are eighty nations and several hundred governments, fighting and
quarreling must be the common business of life; unity of purpose and
policy are impossible; out of such elements supremacy in the world
cannot come. Even caste itself could have had the defeating effect of a
multiplicity of tongues, no doubt; for it separates a people into
layers, and layers, and still other layers, that have no community of
feeling with each other; and in such a condition of things as that,
patriotism can have no healthy growth.</p>
<p>It was the division of the country into so many States and nations
that made Thuggee possible and prosperous. It is difficult to realize
the situation. But perhaps one may approximate it by imagining the
States of our Union peopled by separate nations, speaking separate
languages, with guards and custom-houses strung along all frontiers,
plenty of interruptions for travelers and traders, interpreters able to
handle all the languages very rare or non-existent, and a few wars
always going on here and there and yonder as a further embarrassment to
commerce and excursioning. It would make intercommunication in a measure
ungeneral. India had eighty languages, and more custom-houses than cats.
No clever man with the instinct of a highway robber could fail to notice
what a chance for business was here offered. India was full of clever
men with the highwayman instinct, and so, quite naturally, the
brotherhood of the Thugs came into being to meet the long-felt want.</p>
<p>How long ago that was nobody knows-centuries, it is supposed. One of
the chiefest wonders connected with it was the success with which it
kept its secret. The English trader did business in India two hundred
years and more before he ever heard of it; and yet it was assassinating
its thousands all around him every year, the whole time.</p>
