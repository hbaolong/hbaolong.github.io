<h4 id="chapter-lii.">CHAPTER LII.</h4>
<p>The weeks drifted by monotonously enough, now. The “preliminaries“
continued to drag along in Congress, and life was a dull suspense to
Sellers and Washington, a weary waiting which might have broken their
hearts, maybe, but for the relieving change which they got out of am
occasional visit to New York to see Laura. Standing guard in Washington
or anywhere else is not an exciting business in time of peace, but
standing guard was all that the two friends had to do; all that was
needed of them was that they should be on hand and ready for any
emergency that might come up. There was no work to do; that was all
finished; this was but the second session of the last winter’s Congress,
and its action on the bill could have but one result–its passage. The
house must do its work over again, of course, but the same membership
was there to see that it did it.–The Senate was secure–Senator Dilworthy
was able to put all doubts to rest on that head. Indeed it was no secret
in Washington that a two-thirds vote in the Senate was ready and waiting
to be cast for the University bill as soon as it should come before that
body.</p>
<p>Washington did not take part in the gaieties of “the season,“ as he
had done the previous winter. He had lost his interest in such things;
he was oppressed with cares, now. Senator Dilworthy said to Washington
that an humble deportment, under punishment, was best, and that there
was but one way in which the troubled heart might find perfect repose
and peace. The suggestion found a response in Washington’s breast, and
the Senator saw the sign of it in his face.</p>
<p>From that moment one could find the youth with the Senator even
oftener than with Col. Sellers. When the statesman presided at great
temperance meetings, he placed Washington in the front rank of
impressive dignitaries that gave tone to the occasion and pomp to the
platform. His bald headed surroundings made the youth the more
conspicuous.</p>
<p>When the statesman made remarks in these meetings, he not
infrequently alluded with effect to the encouraging spectacle of one of
the wealthiest and most brilliant young favorites of society forsaking
the light vanities of that butterfly existence to nobly and
self-sacrificingly devote his talents and his riches to the cause of
saving his hapless fellow creatures from shame and misery here and
eternal regret hereafter. At the prayer meetings the Senator always
brought Washington up the aisle on his arm and seated him prominently;
in his prayers he referred to him in the cant terms which the Senator
employed, perhaps unconsciously, and mistook, maybe, for religion, and
in other ways brought him into notice. He had him out at gatherings for
the benefit of the negro, gatherings for the benefit of the Indian,
gatherings for the benefit of the heathen in distant lands. He had him
out time and again, before Sunday Schools, as an example for emulation.
Upon all these occasions the Senator made casual references to many
benevolent enterprises which his ardent young friend was planning
against the day when the passage of the University bill should make his
means available for the amelioration of the condition of the unfortunate
among his fellow men of all nations and all. climes. Thus as the weeks
rolled on Washington grew up, into an imposing lion once more, but a
lion that roamed the peaceful fields of religion and temperance, and
revisited the glittering domain of fashion no more. A great moral
influence was thus brought, to bear in favor of the bill; the weightiest
of friends flocked to its standard; its most energetic enemies said it
was useless to fight longer; they had tacitly surrendered while as yet
the day of battle was not come.</p>
