1872-73. MARK TWAIN IN ENGLAND. LONDON HONORS. ACQUAINTANCE WITH DR.
JOHN BROWN. A LECTURE TRIUMPH. “THE GILDED AGE“</h4>
<p>Clemens did, in fact, sail for England on the given date, and was
lavishly received there. All literary London joined in giving him a good
time. He had not as yet been received seriously by the older American
men of letters, but England made no question as to his title to first
rank. Already, too, they classified him as of the human type of Lincoln,
and reveled in him without stint. Howells writes: “In England, rank,
fashion, and culture rejoiced in him. Lord Mayors, Lord Chief justices,
and magnates of many kinds were his hosts.“</p>
<p>He was treated so well and enjoyed it all so much that he could not
write a book–the kind of book he had planned. One could not poke fun at
a country or a people that had welcomed him with open arms. He made
plenty of notes, at first, but presently gave up the book idea and
devoted himself altogether to having a good time.</p>
<p>He had one grievance–a publisher by the name of Hotten, a sort of
literary harpy, of which there were a great number in those days of
defective copyright, not merely content with pilfering his early work,
had reprinted, under the name of Mark Twain, the work of a mixed
assortment of other humorists, an offensive volume bearing the title,
Screamers and Eye-openers, by Mark Twain.</p>
<p>They besieged him to lecture in London, and promised him overflowing
houses. Artemus Ward, during his last days, had earned London by storm
with his platform humor, and they promised Mark Twain even greater
success. For some reason, however, he did not welcome the idea; perhaps
there was too much gaiety. To Mrs. Clemens he wrote:</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Hartford:</p>
<p>LONDON, Sep. 15, 1872. Livy, darling, everybody says
lecture-lecture-lecture–but I have not the least idea of doing
it–certainly not at present. Mr. Dolby, who took Dickens to America, is
coming to talk business to me tomorrow, though I have sent him word once
before, that I can’t be hired to talk here, because I have no time to
spare.</p>
<p>There is too much sociability–I do not get along fast enough with
work. Tomorrow I lunch with Mr. Toole and a Member of Parliament–Toole
is the most able Comedian of the day. And then I am done for a while. On
Tuesday I mean to hang a card to my keybox, inscribed–“Gone out of the
City for a week“–and then I shall go to work and work hard. One can’t be
caught in a hive of 4,000,000 people, like this.</p>
<p>I have got such a perfectly delightful razor. I have a notion to buy
some for Charley, Theodore and Slee–for I know they have no such razors
there. I have got a neat little watch-chain for Annie–0.</p>
<p>I love you my darling. My love to all of you. SAML.</p>
<p>That Mark Twain should feel and privately report something of his
triumphs we need not wonder at. Certainly he was never one to give
himself airs, but to have the world’s great literary center paying court
to him, who only ten years before had been penniless and unknown, and
who once had been a barefoot Tom Sawyer in Hannibal, was quite
startling. It is gratifying to find evidence of human weakness in the
following heart-to-heart letter to his publisher, especially in view of
the relating circumstances.</p>
<p>To Elisha Bliss, in Hartford:</p>
<p>LONDON, Sept. 28, 1872. FRIEND BLISS,–I have been received in a sort
of tremendous way, tonight, by the brains of London, assembled at the
annual dinner of the Sheriffs of London–mine being (between you and me)
a name which was received with a flattering outburst of spontaneous
applause when the long list of guests was called.</p>
<p>I might have perished on the spot but for the friendly support and
assistance of my excellent friend Sir John Bennett–and I want you to
paste the enclosed in a couple of the handsomest copies of the
“Innocents“ and “Roughing It,“ and send them to him. His address is</p>
<p>“Sir John Bennett, Cheapside, London.“ Yrs Truly S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The “relating circumstances“ were these: At the abovementioned dinner
there had been a roll-call of the distinguished guests present, and each
name had been duly applauded. Clemens, conversing in a whisper with his
neighbor, Sir John Bennett, did not give very close attention to the
names, applauding mechanically with the others.</p>
<p>Finally, a name was read that brought out a vehement hand-clapping.
Mark Twain, not to be outdone in cordiality, joined vigorously, and kept
his hands going even after the others finished. Then, remarking the
general laughter, he whispered to Sir John: “Whose name was that we were
just applauding?“</p>
<p>“Mark Twain’s.“</p>
<p>We may believe that the “friendly support“ of Sir John Bennett was
welcome for the moment. But the incident could do him no harm; the
diners regarded it as one of his jokes, and enjoyed him all the more for
it.</p>
<p>He was ready to go home by November, but by no means had he had
enough of England. He really had some thought of returning there
permanently. In a letter to Mrs. Crane, at Quarry Farm, he wrote:</p>
<p>“If you and Theodore will come over in the Spring with Livy and me,
and spend the summer you will see a country that is so beautiful that
you will be obliged to believe in Fairyland….. and Theodore can browse
with me among dusty old dens that look now as they looked five hundred
years ago; and puzzle over books in the British Museum that were made
before Christ was born; and in the customs of their public dinners, and
the ceremonies of every official act, and the dresses of a thousand
dignitaries, trace the speech and manners of all the centuries that have
dragged their lagging decades over England since the Heptarchy fell
asunder. I would a good deal rather live here if I could get the rest of
you over.“</p>
<p>In a letter home, to his mother and sister, we get a further picture
of his enjoyment.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett:</p>
<p>LONDON, Nov. 6, 1872. MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–I have been so
everlasting busy that I couldn’t write–and moreover I have been so
unceasingly lazy that I couldn’t have written anyhow. I came here to
take notes for a book, but I haven’t done much but attend dinners and
make speeches. But have had a jolly good time and I do hate to go away
from these English folks; they make a stranger feel entirely at home–and
they laugh so easily that it is a comfort to make after-dinner speeches
here. I have made hundreds of friends; and last night in the crush of
the opening of the New Guild-hall Library and Museum, I was surprised to
meet a familiar face every few steps. Nearly 4,000 people, of both
sexes, came and went during the evening, so I had a good opportunity to
make a great many new acquaintances.</p>
<p>Livy is willing to come here with me next April and stay several
months –so I am going home next Tuesday. I would sail on Saturday, but
that is the day of the Lord Mayor’s annual grand state dinner, when they
say 900 of the great men of the city sit down to table, a great many of
them in their fine official and court paraphernalia, so I must not miss
it. However, I may yet change my mind and sail Saturday. I am looking at
a fine Magic lantern which will cost a deal of money, and if I buy it
Sammy may come and learn to make the gas and work the machinery, and
paint pictures for it on glass. I mean to give exhibitions for
charitable purposes in Hartford, and charge a dollar a head. In a hurry,
Ys affly SAM.</p>
<p>He sailed November 12th on the Batavia, arriving in New York two
weeks later. There had been a presidential election in his absence.
General Grant had defeated Horace Greeley, a result, in some measure at
least, attributed to the amusing and powerful pictures of the
cartoonist, Thomas Nast. Mark Twain admired Greeley’s talents, but he
regarded him as poorly qualified for the nation’s chief executive. He
wrote:</p>
<p>To Th. Nast, in Morristown, N. J.:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Nov. 1872. Nast, you more than any other man have won a
prodigious victory for Grant–I mean, rather, for civilization and
progress. Those pictures were simply marvelous, and if any man in the
land has a right to hold his head up and be honestly proud of his share
in this year’s vast events that man is unquestionably yourself. We all
do sincerely honor you, and are proud of you. MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mark Twain was too busy at this time to write letters. His
success in England had made him more than ever popular in America, and
he could by no means keep up with the demands on him. In January he
contributed to the New York Tribune some letters on the Sandwich
Islands, but as these were more properly articles they do not seem to
belong here.</p>
<p>He refused to go on the lecture circuit, though he permitted Redpath
to book him for any occasional appearance, and it is due to one of these
special engagements that we have the only letter preserved from this
time. It is to Howells, and written with that exaggeration with which he
was likely to embellish his difficulties. We are not called upon to
believe that there were really any such demonstrations as those ascribed
to Warner and himself.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>FARMINGTON AVE, Hartford Feb. 27. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I am in a sweat
and Warner is in another. I told Redpath some time ago I would lecture
in Boston any two days he might choose provided they were consecutive
days–</p>
<p>I never dreamed of his choosing days during Lent since that was his
special horror–but all at once he telegraphs me, and hollers at me in
all manner of ways that I am booked for Boston March 5 of all days in
the year–and to make matters just as mixed and uncertain as possible, I
can’t find out to save my life whether he means to lecture me on the 6th
or not.</p>
<p>Warner’s been in here swearing like a lunatic, and saying he had
written you to come on the 4th,–and I said, “You leather-head, if I talk
in Boston both afternoon and evening March 5, I’ll have to go to Boston
the 4th,“–and then he just kicked up his heels and went off cursing
after a fashion I never heard of before.</p>
<p>Now let’s just leave this thing to Providence for 24 hours–you bet it
will come out all right. Yours ever MARK.</p>
<p>He was writing a book with Warner at this time–The Gilded Age –the
two authors having been challenged by their wives one night at dinner to
write a better book than the current novels they had been discussing
with some severity. Clemens already had a story in his mind, and Warner
agreed to collaborate in the writing. It was begun without delay.
Clemens wrote the first three hundred and ninety-nine pages, and read
there aloud to Warner, who took up the story at this point and continued
it through twelve chapters, after which they worked alternately, and
with great enjoyment. They also worked rapidly, and in April the story
was completed. For a collaboration by two men so different in
temperament and literary method it was a remarkable performance.</p>
<p>Another thing Mark Twain did that winter was to buy some land on
Farmington Avenue and begin the building of a home. He had by no means
given up returning to England, and made his plans to sail with
Mrs. Clemens and Susy in May. Miss Clara Spaulding, of Elmira –[Later
Mrs. John B. Stanchfield, of New York.]–a girlhood friend of
Mrs. Clemens–was to accompany them.</p>
<p>The Daily Graphic heard of the proposed journey, and wrote, asking
for a farewell word. His characteristic reply is the only letter of any
kind that has survived from that spring.</p>
<p>To the Editor of “The Daily Graphic,“ in New York City:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Apl. 17, 1873. ED. GRAPHIC,–Your note is received. If the
following two lines which I have cut from it are your natural
handwriting, then I understand you to ask me “for a farewell letter in
the name of the American people.“ Bless you, the joy of the American
people is just a little premature; I haven’t gone yet. And what is more,
I am not going to stay, when I do go.</p>
<p>Yes, it is true. I am only going to remain beyond the sea, six
months, that is all. I love stir and excitement; and so the moment the
spring birds begin to sing, and the lagging weariness of summer to
threaten, I grow restless, I get the fidgets; I want to pack off
somewhere where there’s something going on. But you know how that is–you
must have felt that way. This very day I saw the signs in the air of the
coming dullness, and I said to myself, “How glad I am that I have
already chartered a steamship!“ There was absolutely nothing in the
morning papers. You can see for yourself what the telegraphic headings
were:</p>
<p>BY TELEGRAPH</p>
<p>A Father Killed by His Son</p>
<p>A Bloody Fight in Kentucky</p>
<p>A Court House Fired, and Negroes Therein Shot while Escaping</p>
<p>A Louisiana Massacre</p>
<p>An Eight-year-old murderer Two to Three Hundred Men Roasted
Alive!</p>
<p>A Town in a State of General Riot</p>
<p>A Lively Skirmish in Indiana (and thirty other similar headings.)</p>
<p>The items under those headings all bear date yesterday, Apl. 16
(refer to your own paper)–and I give you my word of honor that that
string of commonplace stuff was everything there was in the telegraphic
columns that a body could call news. Well, said I to myself this is
getting pretty dull; this is getting pretty dry; there don’t appear to
be anything going on anywhere; has this progressive nation gone to
sleep? Have I got to stand another month of this torpidity before I can
begin to browse among the lively capitals of Europe?</p>
<p>But never mind-things may revive while I am away. During the last two
months my next-door neighbor, Chas. Dudley Warner, has dropped his
“Back-Log Studies,“ and he and I have written a bulky novel in
partnership. He has worked up the fiction and I have hurled in the
facts. I consider it one of the most astonishing novels that ever was
written. Night after night I sit up reading it over and over again and
crying. It will be published early in the Fall, with plenty of pictures.
Do you consider this an advertisement?–and if so, do you charge for such
things when a man is your friend? Yours truly, SAML. L. CLEMENS, “MARK
TWAIN,“</p>
<p>An amusing, even if annoying, incident happened about the time of
Mark Twain’s departure. A man named Chew related to Twichell a most
entertaining occurrence. Twichell saw great possibilities in it, and
suggested that Mark Twain be allowed to make a story of it, sharing the
profits with Chew. Chew agreed, and promised to send the facts,
carefully set down. Twichell, in the mean time, told the story to
Clemens, who was delighted with it and strongly tempted to write it at
once, while he was in the spirit, without waiting on Chew. Fortunately,
he did not do so, for when Chew’s material came it was in the form of a
clipping, the story having been already printed in some newspaper.
Chew’s knowledge of literary ethics would seem to have been slight. He
thought himself entitled to something under the agreement with Twichell.
Mark Twain, by this time in London, naturally had a different
opinion.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>LONDON, June 9, ’73. DEAR OLD JOE,–I consider myself wholly at
liberty to decline to pay Chew anything, and at the same time strongly
tempted to sue him into the bargain for coming so near ruining me. If he
hadn’t happened to send me that thing in print, I would have used the
story (like an innocent fool) and would straightway have been hounded to
death as a plagiarist. It would have absolutely destroyed me. I cannot
conceive of a man being such a hopeless ass (after serving as a
legislative reporter, too) as to imagine that I or any other literary
man in his senses would consent to chew over old stuff that had already
been in print. If that man weren’t an infant in swaddling clothes, his
only reply to our petition would have been, “It has been in print.“ It
makes me as mad as the very Old Harry every time I think of Mr. Chew and
the frightfully narrow escape I have had at his hands. Confound
Mr. Chew, with all my heart! I’m willing that he should have ten dollars
for his trouble of warming over his cold victuals–cheerfully willing to
that–but no more. If I had had him near when his letter came, I would
have got out my tomahawk and gone for him. He didn’t tell the story half
as well as you did, anyhow.</p>
<p>I wish to goodness you were here this moment–nobody in our parlor but
Livy and me,–and a very good view of London to the fore. We have a
luxuriously ample suite of apartments in the Langham Hotel, 3rd floor,
our bedroom looking straight up Portland Place and our parlor having a
noble array of great windows looking out upon both streets (Portland
Place and the crook that joins it to Regent Street.)</p>
<p>9 P.M. Full twilight–rich sunset tints lingering in the west.</p>
<p>I am not going to write anything–rather tell it when I get back. I
love you and Harmony, and that is all the fresh news I’ve got, anyway.
And I mean to keep that fresh all the time. Lovingly MARK.</p>
<p>P. S.–Am luxuriating in glorious old Pepy’s Diary, and smoking.</p>
