<h4 id="chapter-xxi.">CHAPTER XXI.</h4>
<p>O lift your natures up: Embrace our aims: work out your freedom.
Girls, Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed; Drink deep until the
habits of the slave, The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite And
slander, die. The Princess.</p>
<p>Whether medicine is a science, or only an empirical method of getting
a living out of the ignorance of the human race, Ruth found before her
first term was over at the medical school that there were other things
she needed to know quite as much as that which is taught in medical
books, and that she could never satisfy her aspirations without more
general culture.</p>
<p>“Does your doctor know any thing–I don’t mean about medicine, but
about things in general, is he a man of information and good sense?“
once asked an old practitioner. “If he doesn’t know any thing but
medicine the chance is he doesn’t know that:“</p>
<p>The close application to her special study was beginning to tell upon
Ruth’s delicate health also, and the summer brought with it only
weariness and indisposition for any mental effort.</p>
<p>In this condition of mind and body the quiet of her home and the
unexciting companionship of those about her were more than ever
tiresome.</p>
<p>She followed with more interest Philip’s sparkling account of his
life in the west, and longed for his experiences, and to know some of
those people of a world so different from here, who alternately amused
and displeased him. He at least was learning the world, the good and the
bad of it, as must happen to every one who accomplishes anything in
it.</p>
<p>But what, Ruth wrote, could a woman do, tied up by custom, and cast
into particular circumstances out of which it was almost impossible to
extricate herself? Philip thought that he would go some day and
extricate Ruth, but he did not write that, for he had the instinct to
know that this was not the extrication she dreamed of, and that she must
find out by her own experience what her heart really wanted.</p>
<p>Philip was not a philosopher, to be sure, but he had the old
fashioned notion, that whatever a woman’s theories of life might be, she
would come round to matrimony, only give her time. He could indeed
recall to mind one woman–and he never knew a nobler–whose whole soul was
devoted and who believed that her life was consecrated to a certain
benevolent project in singleness of life, who yielded to the touch of
matrimony, as an icicle yields to a sunbeam.</p>
<p>Neither at home nor elsewhere did Ruth utter any complaint, or admit
any weariness or doubt of her ability to pursue the path she had marked
out for herself. But her mother saw clearly enough her struggle with
infirmity, and was not deceived by either her gaiety or by the cheerful
composure which she carried into all the ordinary duties that fell to
her. She saw plainly enough that Ruth needed an entire change of scene
and of occupation, and perhaps she believed that such a change, with the
knowledge of the world it would bring, would divert Ruth from a course
for which she felt she was physically entirely unfitted.</p>
<p>It therefore suited the wishes of all concerned, when autumn came,
that Ruth should go away to school. She selected a large New England
Seminary, of which she had often heard Philip speak, which was attended
by both sexes and offered almost collegiate advantages of education.
Thither she went in September, and began for the second time in the year
a life new to her.</p>
<p>The Seminary was the chief feature of Fallkill, a village of two to
three thousand inhabitants. It was a prosperous school, with three
hundred students, a large corps of teachers, men and women, and with a
venerable rusty row of academic buildings on the shaded square of the
town. The students lodged and boarded in private families in the place,
and so it came about that while the school did a great deal to support
the town, the town gave the students society and the sweet influences of
home life. It is at least respectful to say that the influences of home
life are sweet.</p>
<p>Ruth’s home, by the intervention of Philip, was in a family–one of
the rare exceptions in life or in fiction–that had never known better
days. The Montagues, it is perhaps well to say, had intended to come
over in the Mayflower, but were detained at Delft Haven by the illness
of a child. They came over to Massachusetts Bay in another vessel, and
thus escaped the onus of that brevet nobility under which the successors
of the Mayflower Pilgrims have descended. Having no factitious weight of
dignity to carry, the Montagues steadily improved their condition from
the day they landed, and they were never more vigorous or prosperous
than at the date of this narrative. With character compacted by the
rigid Puritan discipline of more than two centuries, they had retained
its strength and purity and thrown off its narrowness, and were now
blossoming under the generous modern influences. Squire Oliver Montague,
a lawyer who had retired from the practice of his profession except in
rare cases, dwelt in a square old fashioned New England mansion a
quarter of a mile away from the green. It was called a mansion because
it stood alone with ample fields about it, and had an avenue of trees
leading to it from the road, and on the west commanded a view of a
pretty little lake with gentle slopes and nodding were now blossoming
under the generous modern influences. Squire Oliver Montague, a lawyer
who had retired from the practice of his profession except in rare
cases, dwelt in a square old fashioned New England groves. But it was
just a plain, roomy house, capable of extending to many guests an
unpretending hospitality.</p>
<p>The family consisted of the Squire and his wife, a son and a daughter
married and not at home, a son in college at Cambridge, another son at
the Seminary, and a daughter Alice, who was a year or more older than
Ruth. Having only riches enough to be able to gratify reasonable
desires, and yet make their gratifications always a novelty and a
pleasure, the family occupied that just mean in life which is so rarely
attained, and still more rarely enjoyed without discontent.</p>
<p>If Ruth did not find so much luxury in the house as in her own home,
there were evidences of culture, of intellectual activity and of a zest
in the affairs of all the world, which greatly impressed her. Every room
had its book-cases or book-shelves, and was more or less a library; upon
every table was liable to be a litter of new books, fresh periodicals
and daily newspapers. There were plants in the sunny windows and some
choice engravings on the walls, with bits of color in oil or
water-colors; the piano was sure to be open and strewn with music; and
there were photographs and little souvenirs here and there of foreign
travel. An absence of any “what-pots“ in the corners with rows of
cheerful shells, and Hindoo gods, and Chinese idols, and nests of use
less boxes of lacquered wood, might be taken as denoting a languidness
in the family concerning foreign missions, but perhaps unjustly.</p>
<p>At any rate the life of the world flowed freely into this hospitable
house, and there was always so much talk there of the news of the day,
of the new books and of authors, of Boston radicalism and New York
civilization, and the virtue of Congress, that small gossip stood a very
poor chance.</p>
<p>All this was in many ways so new to Ruth that she seemed to have
passed into another world, in which she experienced a freedom and a
mental exhilaration unknown to her before. Under this influence she
entered upon her studies with keen enjoyment, finding for a time all the
relaxation she needed, in the charming social life at the Montague
house.</p>
<p>It is strange, she wrote to Philip, in one of her occasional letters,
that you never told me more about this delightful family, and scarcely
mentioned Alice who is the life of it, just the noblest girl, unselfish,
knows how to do so many things, with lots of talent, with a dry humor,
and an odd way of looking at things, and yet quiet and even serious
often–one of your “capable“ New England girls. We shall be great
friends. It had never occurred to Philip that there was any thing
extraordinary about the family that needed mention. He knew dozens of
girls like Alice, he thought to himself, but only one like Ruth.</p>
<p>Good friends the two girls were from the beginning. Ruth was a study
to Alice; the product of a culture entirely foreign to her experience,
so much a child in some things, so much a woman in others; and Ruth in
turn, it must be confessed, probing Alice sometimes with her serious
grey eyes, wondered what her object in life was, and whether she had any
purpose beyond living as she now saw her. For she could scarcely
conceive of a life that should not be devoted to the accomplishment of
some definite work, and she had-no doubt that in her own case everything
else would yield to the professional career she had marked out.</p>
<p>“So you know Philip Sterling,“ said Ruth one day as the girls sat at
their sewing. Ruth never embroidered, and never sewed when she could
avoid it. Bless her.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, we are old friends. Philip used to come to Fallkill often
while he was in college. He was once rusticated here for a term.“</p>
<p>“Rusticated?“</p>
<p>“Suspended for some College scrape. He was a great favorite here.
Father and he were famous friends. Father said that Philip had no end of
nonsense in him and was always blundering into something, but he was a
royal good fellow and would come out all right.“</p>
<p>“Did you think he was fickle?“</p>
<p>“Why, I never thought whether he was or not,“ replied Alice looking
up. “I suppose he was always in love with some girl or another, as
college boys are. He used to make me his confidant now and then, and be
terribly in the dumps.“</p>
<p>“Why did he come to you?“ pursued Ruth you were younger than he.“</p>
<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. He was at our house a good deal. Once at a
picnic by the lake, at the risk of his own life, he saved sister Millie
from drowning, and we all liked to have him here. Perhaps he thought as
he had saved one sister, the other ought to help him when he was in
trouble. I don’t know.“</p>
<p>The fact was that Alice was a person who invited confidences, because
she never betrayed them, and gave abundant sympathy in return. There are
persons, whom we all know, to whom human confidences, troubles and
heart-aches flow as naturally its streams to a placid lake.</p>
<p>This is not a history of Fallkill, nor of the Montague family, worthy
as both are of that honor, and this narrative cannot be diverted into
long loitering with them. If the reader visits the village to-day, he
will doubtless be pointed out the Montague dwelling, where Ruth lived,
the cross-lots path she traversed to the Seminary, and the venerable
chapel with its cracked bell.</p>
<p>In the little society of the place, the Quaker girl was a favorite,
and no considerable social gathering or pleasure party was thought
complete without her. There was something in this seemingly transparent
and yet deep character, in her childlike gaiety and enjoyment of the
society about her, and in her not seldom absorption in herself, that
would have made her long remembered there if no events had subsequently
occurred to recall her to mind.</p>
<p>To the surprise of Alice, Ruth took to the small gaieties of the
village with a zest of enjoyment that seemed foreign to one who had
devoted her life to a serious profession from the highest motives. Alice
liked society well enough, she thought, but there was nothing exciting
in that of Fallkill, nor anything novel in the attentions of the
well-bred young gentlemen one met in it. It must have worn a different
aspect to Ruth, for she entered into its pleasures at first with
curiosity, and then with interest and finally with a kind of staid
abandon that no one would have deemed possible for her. Parties,
picnics, rowing-matches, moonlight strolls, nutting expeditions in the
October woods,–Alice declared that it was a whirl of dissipation. The
fondness of Ruth, which was scarcely disguised, for the company of
agreeable young fellows, who talked nothings, gave Alice opportunity for
no end of banter.</p>
<p>“Do you look upon them as I subjects, dear?“ she would ask.</p>
<p>And Ruth laughed her merriest laugh, and then looked sober again.
Perhaps she was thinking, after all, whether she knew herself.</p>
<p>If you should rear a duck in the heart of the Sahara, no doubt it
would swim if you brought it to the Nile.</p>
<p>Surely no one would have predicted when Ruth left Philadelphia that
she would become absorbed to this extent, and so happy, in a life so
unlike that she thought she desired. But no one can tell how a woman
will act under any circumstances. The reason novelists nearly always
fail in depicting women when they make them act, is that they let them
do what they have observed some woman has done at sometime or another.
And that is where they make a mistake; for a woman will never do again
what has been done before. It is this uncertainty that causes women,
considered as materials for fiction, to be so interesting to themselves
and to others.</p>
<p>As the fall went on and the winter, Ruth did not distinguish herself
greatly at the Fallkill Seminary as a student, a fact that apparently
gave her no anxiety, and did not diminish her enjoyment of a new sort of
power which had awakened within her.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII. In mid-winter, an event occurred of unusual interest to
the inhabitants of the Montague house, and to the friends of the young
ladies who sought their society.</p>
<p>This was the arrival at the Sassacua Hotel of two young gentlemen
from the west.</p>
<p>It is the fashion in New England to give Indian names to the public
houses, not that the late lamented savage knew how to keep a hotel, but
that his warlike name may impress the traveler who humbly craves shelter
there, and make him grateful to the noble and gentlemanly clerk if he is
allowed to depart with his scalp safe.</p>
<p>The two young gentlemen were neither students for the Fallkill
Seminary, nor lecturers on physiology, nor yet life assurance
solicitors, three suppositions that almost exhausted the guessing power
of the people at the hotel in respect to the names of “Philip Sterling
and Henry Brierly, Missouri,“ on the register. They were handsome enough
fellows, that was evident, browned by out-door exposure, and with a free
and lordly way about them that almost awed the hotel clerk himself.
Indeed, he very soon set down Mr. Brierly as a gentleman of large
fortune, with enormous interests on his shoulders. Harry had a way of
casually mentioning western investments, through lines, the freighting
business, and the route through the Indian territory to Lower
California, which was calculated to give an importance to his lightest
word.</p>
<p>“You’ve a pleasant town here, sir, and the most comfortable looking
hotel I’ve seen out of New York,“ said Harry to the clerk; “we shall
stay here a few days if you can give us a roomy suite of
apartments.“</p>
<p>Harry usually had the best of everything, wherever he went, as such
fellows always do have in this accommodating world. Philip would have
been quite content with less expensive quarters, but there was no
resisting Harry’s generosity in such matters.</p>
<p>Railroad surveying and real-estate operations were at a standstill
during the winter in Missouri, and the young men had taken advantage of
the lull to come east, Philip to see if there was any disposition in his
friends, the railway contractors, to give him a share in the Salt Lick
Union Pacific Extension, and Harry to open out to his uncle the
prospects of the new city at Stone’s Landing, and to procure
congressional appropriations for the harbor and for making Goose Run
navigable. Harry had with him a map of that noble stream and of the
harbor, with a perfect net-work of railroads centering in it, pictures
of wharves, crowded with steamboats, and of huge grain-elevators on the
bank, all of which grew out of the combined imaginations of Col. Sellers
and Mr. Brierly. The Colonel had entire confidence in Harry’s influence
with Wall street, and with congressmen, to bring about the consummation
of their scheme, and he waited his return in the empty house at Hawkeye,
feeding his pinched family upon the most gorgeous expectations with a
reckless prodigality.</p>
<p>“Don’t let ’em into the thing more than is necessary,“ says the
Colonel to Harry; “give ’em a small interest; a lot apiece in the
suburbs of the Landing ought to do a congressman, but I reckon you’ll
have to mortgage a part of the city itself to the brokers.“</p>
<p>Harry did not find that eagerness to lend money on Stone’s Landing in
Wall street which Col. Sellers had expected, (it had seen too many such
maps as he exhibited), although his uncle and some of the brokers looked
with more favor on the appropriation for improving the navigation of
Columbus River, and were not disinclined to form a company for that
purpose. An appropriation was a tangible thing, if you could get hold of
it, and it made little difference what it was appropriated for, so long
as you got hold of it.</p>
<p>Pending these weighty negotiations, Philip has persuaded Harry to
take a little run up to Fallkill, a not difficult task, for that young
man would at any time have turned his back upon all the land in the West
at sight of a new and pretty face, and he had, it must be confessed, a
facility in love making which made it not at all an interference with
the more serious business of life. He could not, to be sure, conceive
how Philip could be interested in a young lady who was studying
medicine, but he had no objection to going, for he did not doubt that
there were other girls in Fallkill who were worth a week’s
attention.</p>
<p>The young men were received at the house of the Montagues with the
hospitality which never failed there.</p>
<p>“We are glad to see you again,“ exclaimed the Squire heartily, “you
are welcome Mr. Brierly, any friend of Phil’s is welcome at our
house“</p>
<p>“It’s more like home to me, than any place except my own home,“ cried
Philip, as he looked about the cheerful house and went through a general
hand-shaking.</p>
<p>“It’s a long time, though, since you have been here to say so,“ Alice
said, with her father’s frankness of manner; “and I suspect we owe the
visit now to your sudden interest in the Fallkill Seminary.“</p>
<p>Philip’s color came, as it had an awkward way of doing in his
tell-tale face, but before he could stammer a reply, Harry came in
with,</p>
<p>“That accounts for Phil’s wish to build a Seminary at Stone’s
Landing, our place in Missouri, when Col. Sellers insisted it should be
a University. Phil appears to have a weakness for Seminaries.“</p>
<p>“It would have been better for your friend Sellers,“ retorted Philip,
“if he had had a weakness for district schools. Col. Sellers, Miss
Alice, is a great friend of Harry’s, who is always trying to build a
house by beginning at the top.“</p>
<p>“I suppose it’s as easy to build a University on paper as a Seminary,
and it looks better,“ was Harry’s reflection; at which the Squire
laughed, and said he quite agreed with him. The old gentleman understood
Stone’s Landing a good deal better than he would have done after an
hour’s talk with either of it’s expectant proprietors.</p>
<p>At this moment, and while Philip was trying to frame a question that
he found it exceedingly difficult to put into words, the door opened
quietly, and Ruth entered. Taking in the, group with a quick glance, her
eye lighted up, and with a merry smile she advanced and shook hands with
Philip. She was so unconstrained and sincerely cordial, that it made
that hero of the west feel somehow young, and very ill at ease.</p>
<p>For months and months he had thought of this meeting and pictured it
to himself a hundred times, but he had never imagined it would be like
this. He should meet Ruth unexpectedly, as she was walking alone from
the school, perhaps, or entering the room where he was waiting for her,
and she would cry “Oh! Phil,“ and then check herself, and perhaps blush,
and Philip calm but eager and enthusiastic, would reassure her by his
warm manner, and he would take her hand impressively, and she would look
up timidly, and, after his’ long absence, perhaps he would be permitted
to Good heavens, how many times he had come to this point, and wondered
if it could happen so. Well, well; he had never supposed that he should
be the one embarrassed, and above all by a sincere and cordial
welcome.</p>
<p>“We heard you were at the Sassacus House,“ were Ruth’s first words;
“and this I suppose is your friend?“</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon,“ Philip at length blundered out, “this is
Mr. Brierly of whom I have written you.“</p>
<p>And Ruth welcomed Harry with a friendliness that Philip thought was
due to his friend, to be sure, but which seemed to him too level with
her reception of himself, but which Harry received as his due from the
other sex.</p>
<p>Questions were asked about the journey and about the West, and the
conversation became a general one, until Philip at length found himself
talking with the Squire in relation to land and railroads and things he
couldn’t keep his mind on especially as he heard Ruth and Harry in an
animated discourse, and caught the words “New York,“ and “opera,“ and
“reception,“ and knew that Harry was giving his imagination full range
in the world of fashion.</p>
<p>Harry knew all about the opera, green room and all (at least he said
so) and knew a good many of the operas and could make very entertaining
stories of their plots, telling how the soprano came in here, and the
basso here, humming the beginning of their airs–tum-ti-tum-ti-ti
–suggesting the profound dissatisfaction of the basso recitative–down
–among–the–dead–men–and touching off the whole with an airy grace quite
captivating; though he couldn’t have sung a single air through to save
himself, and he hadn’t an ear to know whether it was sung correctly. All
the same he doted on the opera, and kept a box there, into which he
lounged occasionally to hear a favorite scene and meet his society
friends.</p>
<p>If Ruth was ever in the city he should be happy to place his box at
the disposal of Ruth and her friends. Needless to say that she was
delighted with the offer.</p>
<p>When she told Philip of it, that discreet young fellow only smiled,
and said that he hoped she would be fortunate enough to be in New York
some evening when Harry had not already given the use of his private box
to some other friend.</p>
<p>The Squire pressed the visitors to let him send for their trunks and
urged them to stay at his house, and Alice joined in the invitation, but
Philip had reasons for declining. They staid to supper, however, and in;
the evening Philip had a long talk apart with Ruth, a delightful hour to
him, in which she spoke freely of herself as of old, of her studies at
Philadelphia and of her plans, and she entered into his adventures and
prospects in the West with a genuine and almost sisterly interest; an
interest, however, which did not exactly satisfy Philip–it was too
general and not personal enough to suit him. And with all her freedom in
speaking of her own hopes, Philip could not, detect any reference to
himself in them; whereas he never undertook anything that he did not
think of Ruth in connection with it, he never made a plan that had not
reference to her, and he never thought of anything as complete if she
could not share it. Fortune, reputation these had no value to him except
in Ruth’s eyes, and there were times when it seemed to him that if Ruth
was not on this earth, he should plunge off into some remote wilderness
and live in a purposeless seclusion.</p>
<p>“I hoped,“ said Philip; “to get a little start in connection with
this new railroad, and make a little money, so that I could came east
and engage in something more suited to my tastes. I shouldn’t like to
live in the West. Would you?</p>
<p>“It never occurred to me whether I would or not,“ was the
unembarrassed reply. “One of our graduates went to Chicago, and has a
nice practice there. I don’t know where I shall go. It would mortify
mother dreadfully to have me driving about Philadelphia in a doctor’s
gig.“</p>
<p>Philip laughed at the idea of it. “And does it seem as necessary to
you to do it as it did before you came to Fallkill?“</p>
<p>It was a home question, and went deeper than Philip knew, for Ruth at
once thought of practicing her profession among the young gentlemen and
ladies of her acquaintance in the village; but she was reluctant to
admit to herself that her notions of a career had undergone any
change.</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t think I should come to Fallkill to practice, but I must
do something when I am through school; and why not medicine?“</p>
<p>Philip would like to have explained why not, but the explanation
would be of no use if it were not already obvious to Ruth.</p>
<p>Harry was equally in his element whether instructing Squire Montague
about the investment of capital in Missouri, the improvement of Columbus
River, the project he and some gentlemen in New York had for making a
shorter Pacific connection with the Mississippi than the present one; or
diverting Mrs. Montague with his experience in cooking in camp; or
drawing for Miss Alice an amusing picture of the social contrasts of New
England and the border where he had been. Harry was a very entertaining
fellow, having his imagination to help his memory, and telling his
stories as if he believed them–as perhaps he did. Alice was greatly
amused with Harry and listened so seriously to his romancing that he
exceeded his usual limits. Chance allusions to his bachelor
establishment in town and the place of his family on the Hudson, could
not have been made by a millionaire, more naturally.</p>
<p>“I should think,“ queried Alice, “you would rather stay in New York
than to try the rough life at the West you have been speaking of.“</p>
<p>“Oh, adventure,“ says Harry, “I get tired of New York. And besides I
got involved in some operations that I had to see through. Parties in
New York only last week wanted me to go down into Arizona in a big
diamond interest. I told them, no, no speculation for me. I’ve got my
interests in Missouri; and I wouldn’t leave Philip, as long as he stays
there.“</p>
<p>When the young gentlemen were on their way back to the hotel,
Mr. Philip, who was not in very good humor, broke out,</p>
<p>“What the deuce, Harry, did you go on in that style to the Montagues
for?“</p>
<p>“Go on?“ cried Harry. “Why shouldn’t I try to make a pleasant
evening? And besides, ain’t I going to do those things? What difference
does it make about the mood and tense of a mere verb? Didn’t uncle tell
me only last Saturday, that I might as well go down to Arizona and hunt
for diamonds? A fellow might as well make a good impression as a poor
one.“</p>
<p>“Nonsense. You’ll get to believing your own romancing by and by.“</p>
<p>“Well, you’ll see. When Sellers and I get that appropriation, I’ll
show you an establishment in town and another on the Hudson and a box at
the opera.“</p>
<p>“Yes, it will be like Col. Sellers’ plantation at Hawkeye. Did you
ever see that?“</p>
<p>“Now, don’t be cross, Phil. She’s just superb, that little woman. You
never told me.“</p>
<p>“Who’s just superb?“ growled Philip, fancying this turn of the
conversation less than the other.</p>
<p>“Well, Mrs. Montague, if you must know.“ And Harry stopped to light a
cigar, and then puffed on in silence. The little quarrel didn’t last
over night, for Harry never appeared to cherish any ill-will half a
second, and Philip was too sensible to continue a row about nothing; and
he had invited Harry to come with him.</p>
<p>The young gentlemen stayed in Fallkill a week, and were every day at
the Montagues, and took part in the winter gaieties of the village.
There were parties here and there to which the friends of Ruth and the
Montagues were of course invited, and Harry in the generosity of his
nature, gave in return a little supper at the hotel, very simple indeed,
with dancing in the hall, and some refreshments passed round. And Philip
found the whole thing in the bill when he came to pay it.</p>
<p>Before the week was over Philip thought he had a new light on the
character of Ruth. Her absorption in the small gaieties of the society
there surprised him. He had few opportunities for serious conversation
with her. There was always some butterfly or another flitting about, and
when Philip showed by his manner that he was not pleased, Ruth laughed
merrily enough and rallied him on his soberness–she declared he was
getting to be grim and unsocial. He talked indeed more with Alice than
with Ruth, and scarcely concealed from her the trouble that was in his
mind. It needed, in fact, no word from him, for she saw clearly enough
what was going forward, and knew her sex well enough to know there was
no remedy for it but time.</p>
<p>“Ruth is a dear girl, Philip, and has as much firmness of purpose as
ever, but don’t you see she has just discovered that she is fond of
society? Don’t you let her see you are selfish about it, is my
advice.“</p>
<p>The last evening they were to spend in Fallkill, they were at the
Montagues, and Philip hoped that he would find Ruth in a different mood.
But she was never more gay, and there was a spice of mischief in her eye
and in her laugh. “Confound it,“ said Philip to himself, “she’s in a
perfect twitter.“</p>
<p>He would have liked to quarrel with her, and fling himself out of the
house in tragedy style, going perhaps so far as to blindly wander off
miles into the country and bathe his throbbing brow in the chilling rain
of the stars, as people do in novels; but he had no opportunity. For
Ruth was as serenely unconscious of mischief as women can be at times,
and fascinated him more than ever with her little demurenesses and
half-confidences. She even said “Thee“ to him once in reproach for a
cutting speech he began. And the sweet little word made his heart beat
like a trip-hammer, for never in all her life had she said “thee“ to him
before.</p>
<p>Was she fascinated with Harry’s careless ‘bon homie’ and gay
assurance? Both chatted away in high spirits, and made the evening whirl
along in the most mirthful manner. Ruth sang for Harry, and that young
gentleman turned the leaves for her at the piano, and put in a bass note
now and then where he thought it would tell.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a merry evening, and Philip was heartily glad when it was
over, and the long leave-taking with the family was through with.</p>
<p>“Farewell Philip. Good night Mr. Brierly,“ Ruth’s clear voice sounded
after them as they went down the walk.</p>
<p>And she spoke Harry’s name last, thought Philip.</p>
