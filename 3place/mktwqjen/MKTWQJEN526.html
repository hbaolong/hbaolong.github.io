<h4 id="chapter-xli.">CHAPTER XLI.</h4>
<p>A POSTSCRIPT BY CLARENCE</p>
<p>I, Clarence, must write it for him. He proposed that we two go out
and see if any help could be accorded the wounded. I was strenuous
against the project. I said that if there were many, we could do but
little for them; and it would not be wise for us to trust ourselves
among them, anyway. But he could seldom be turned from a purpose once
formed; so we shut off the electric current from the fences, took an
escort along, climbed over the enclosing ramparts of dead knights, and
moved out upon the field. The first wounded mall who appealed for help
was sitting with his back against a dead comrade. When The Boss bent
over him and spoke to him, the man recognized him and stabbed him. That
knight was Sir Meliagraunce, as I found out by tearing off his helmet.
He will not ask for help any more.</p>
<p>We carried The Boss to the cave and gave his wound, which was not
very serious, the best care we could. In this service we had the help of
Merlin, though we did not know it. He was disguised as a woman, and
appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife. In this disguise, with
brown-stained face and smooth shaven, he had appeared a few days after
The Boss was hurt and offered to cook for us, saying her people had gone
off to join certain new camps which the enemy were forming, and that she
was starving. The Boss had been getting along very well, and had amused
himself with finishing up his record.</p>
<p>We were glad to have this woman, for we were short handed. We were in
a trap, you see–a trap of our own making. If we stayed where we were,
our dead would kill us; if we moved out of our defenses, we should no
longer be invincible. We had conquered; in turn we were conquered. The
Boss recognized this; we all recognized it. If we could go to one of
those new camps and patch up some kind of terms with the enemy–yes, but
The Boss could not go, and neither could I, for I was among the first
that were made sick by the poisonous air bred by those dead thousands.
Others were taken down, and still others. To-morrow–</p>
<p><em>To-morrow.</em> It is here. And with it the end. About midnight I
awoke, and saw that hag making curious passes in the air about The
Boss’s head and face, and wondered what it meant. Everybody but the
dynamo-watch lay steeped in sleep; there was no sound. The woman ceased
from her mysterious foolery, and started tip-toeing toward the door. I
called out:</p>
<p>“Stop! What have you been doing?“</p>
<p>She halted, and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction:</p>
<p>“Ye were conquerors; ye are conquered! These others are perishing
–you also. Ye shall all die in this place–every one–except <em>him</em>.
He sleepeth now–and shall sleep thirteen centuries. I am Merlin!“</p>
<p>Then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled
about like a drunken man, and presently fetched up against one of our
wires. His mouth is spread open yet; apparently he is still laughing. I
suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until the corpse turns
to dust.</p>
<p>The Boss has never stirred–sleeps like a stone. If he does not wake
to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is, and his body will
then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses of the cave where
none will ever find it to desecrate it. As for the rest of us–well, it
is agreed that if any one of us ever escapes alive from this place, he
will write the fact here, and loyally hide this Manuscript with The
Boss, our dear good chief, whose property it is, be he alive or
dead.</p>
<p>THE END OF THE MANUSCRIPT</p>
<p>FINAL P.S. BY M.T.</p>
<p>The dawn was come when I laid the Manuscript aside. The rain had
almost ceased, the world was gray and sad, the exhausted storm was
sighing and sobbing itself to rest. I went to the stranger’s room, and
listened at his door, which was slightly ajar. I could hear his voice,
and so I knocked. There was no answer, but I still heard the voice. I
peeped in. The man lay on his back in bed, talking brokenly but with
spirit, and punctuating with his arms, which he thrashed about,
restlessly, as sick people do in delirium. I slipped in softly and bent
over him. His mutterings and ejaculations went on. I spoke–merely a
word, to call his attention. His glassy eyes and his ashy face were
alight in an instant with pleasure, gratitude, gladness, welcome:</p>
<p>“Oh, Sandy, you are come at last–how I have longed for you! Sit by
me–do not leave me–never leave me again, Sandy, never again. Where is
your hand?–give it me, dear, let me hold it–there –now all is well, all
is peace, and I am happy again–<em>we</em> are happy again, isn’t it so,
Sandy? You are so dim, so vague, you are but a mist, a cloud, but you
are <em>here</em>, and that is blessedness sufficient; and I have your
hand; don’t take it away–it is for only a little while, I shall not
require it long…. Was that the child?… Hello-Central!… she doesn’t
answer. Asleep, perhaps? Bring her when she wakes, and let me touch her
hands, her face, her hair, and tell her good-bye…. Sandy! Yes, you are
there. I lost myself a moment, and I thought you were gone…. Have I been
sick long? It must be so; it seems months to me. And such dreams! such
strange and awful dreams, Sandy! Dreams that were as real as
reality–delirium, of course, but <em>so</em> real! Why, I thought the
king was dead, I thought you were in Gaul and couldn’t get home, I
thought there was a revolution; in the fantastic frenzy of these dreams,
I thought that Clarence and I and a handful of my cadets fought and
exterminated the whole chivalry of England! But even that was not the
strangest. I seemed to be a creature out of a remote unborn age,
centuries hence, and even <em>that</em> was as real as the rest! Yes, I
seemed to have flown back out of that age into this of ours, and then
forward to it again, and was set down, a stranger and forlorn in that
strange England, with an abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me
and you! between me and my home and my friends! between me and all that
is dear to me, all that could make life worth the living! It was awful
–awfuler than you can ever imagine, Sandy. Ah, watch by me, Sandy –stay
by me every moment–<em>don’t</em> let me go out of my mind again; death
is nothing, let it come, but not with those dreams, not with the torture
of those hideous dreams–I cannot endure <em>that</em> again….
Sandy?…“</p>
<p>He lay muttering incoherently some little time; then for a time he
lay silent, and apparently sinking away toward death. Presently his
fingers began to pick busily at the coverlet, and by that sign I knew
that his end was at hand with the first suggestion of the death-rattle
in his throat he started up slightly, and seemed to listen: then he
said:</p>
<p>“A bugle?… It is the king! The drawbridge, there! Man the
battlements!–turn out the–“</p>
<p>He was getting up his last “effect“; but he never finished it.</p>

<h2 id="the-american-claimant">THE AMERICAN CLAIMANT</h2>
<p>by Mark Twain</p>
<p>1892</p>
<p>EXPLANATORY</p>
<p>The Colonel Mulberry Sellers here re-introduced to the public is the
same person who appeared as Eschol Sellers in the first edition of the
tale entitled “The Gilded Age,“ years ago, and as Beriah Sellers in the
subsequent editions of the same book, and finally as Mulberry Sellers in
the drama played afterward by John T. Raymond.</p>
<p>The name was changed from Eschol to Beriah to accommodate an Eschol
Sellers who rose up out of the vasty deeps of uncharted space and
preferred his request–backed by threat of a libel suit–then went his way
appeased, and came no more. In the play Beriah had to be dropped to
satisfy another member of the race, and Mulberry was substituted in the
hope that the objectors would be tired by that time and let it pass
unchallenged. So far it has occupied the field in peace; therefore we
chance it again, feeling reasonably safe, this time, under shelter of
the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN. Hartford, 1891.</p>
<p>THE WEATHER IN THIS BOOK.</p>
<p>No weather will be found in this book. This is an attempt to pull a
book through without weather. It being the first attempt of the kind in
fictitious literature, it may prove a failure, but it seemed worth the
while of some dare-devil person to try it, and the author was in just
the mood.</p>
<p>Many a reader who wanted to read a tale through was not able to do it
because of delays on account of the weather. Nothing breaks up an
author’s progress like having to stop every few pages to fuss-up the
weather. Thus it is plain that persistent intrusions of weather are bad
for both reader and author.</p>
<p>Of course weather is necessary to a narrative of human experience.
That is conceded. But it ought to be put where it will not be in the
way; where it will not interrupt the flow of the narrative. And it ought
to be the ablest weather that can be had, not ignorant, poor-quality,
amateur weather. Weather is a literary specialty, and no untrained hand
can turn out a good article of it. The present author can do only a few
trifling ordinary kinds of weather, and he cannot do those very good. So
it has seemed wisest to borrow such weather as is necessary for the book
from qualified and recognized experts–giving credit, of course. This
weather will be found over in the back part of the book, out of the way.
See Appendix. The reader is requested to turn over and help himself from
time to time as he goes along.</p>
