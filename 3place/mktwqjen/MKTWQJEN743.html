<h4 id="chapter-lviii.">CHAPTER, LVIII.</h4>
<p>Make it a point to do something every day that you don’t want to do.
This is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty
without pain. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>It seems to be settled, now, that among the many causes from which
the Great Mutiny sprang, the main one was the annexation of the kingdom
of Oudh by the East India Company–characterized by Sir Henry Lawrence as
“the most unrighteous act that was ever committed.“ In the spring of
1857, a mutinous spirit was observable in many of the native garrisons,
and it grew day by day and spread wider and wider. The younger military
men saw something very serious in it, and would have liked to take hold
of it vigorously and stamp it out promptly; but they were not in
authority. Old-men were in the high places of the army–men who should
have been retired long before, because of their great age–and they
regarded the matter as a thing of no consequence. They loved their
native soldiers, and would not believe that anything could move them to
revolt. Everywhere these obstinate veterans listened serenely to the
rumbling of the volcanoes under them, and said it was nothing.</p>
<p>And so the propagators of mutiny had everything their own way. They
moved from camp to camp undisturbed, and painted to the native soldier
the wrongs his people were suffering at the hands of the English, and
made his heart burn for revenge. They were able to point to two facts of
formidable value as backers of their persuasions: In Clive’s day, native
armies were incoherent mobs, and without effective arms; therefore, they
were weak against Clive’s organized handful of well-armed men, but the
thing was the other way, now. The British forces were native; they had
been trained by the British, organized by the British, armed by the
British, all the power was in their hands–they were a club made by
British hands to beat out British brains with. There was nothing to
oppose their mass, nothing but a few weak battalions of British soldiers
scattered about India, a force not worth speaking of. This argument,
taken alone, might not have succeeded, for the bravest and best Indian
troops had a wholesome dread of the white soldier, whether he was weak
or strong; but the agitators backed it with their second and best point
prophecy–a prophecy a hundred years old. The Indian is open to prophecy
at all times; argument may fail to convince him, but not prophecy. There
was a prophecy that a hundred years from the year of that battle of
Clive’s which founded the British Indian Empire, the British power would
be overthrown and swept away by the natives.</p>
<p>The Mutiny broke out at Meerut on the 10th of May, 1857, and fired a
train of tremendous historical explosions. Nana Sahib’s massacre of the
surrendered garrison of Cawnpore occurred in June, and the long siege of
Lucknow began. The military history of England is old and great, but I
think it must be granted that the crushing of the Mutiny is the greatest
chapter in it. The British were caught asleep and unprepared. They were
a few thousands, swallowed up in an ocean of hostile populations. It
would take months to inform England and get help, but they did not
falter or stop to count the odds, but with English resolution and
English devotion they took up their task, and went stubbornly on with
it, through good fortune and bad, and fought the most unpromising fight
that one may read of in fiction or out of it, and won it thoroughly.</p>
<p>The Mutiny broke out so suddenly, and spread with such rapidity that
there was but little time for occupants of weak outlying stations to
escape to places of safety. Attempts were made, of course, but they were
attended by hardships as bitter as death in the few cases which were
successful; for the heat ranged between 120 and 138 in the shade; the
way led through hostile peoples, and food and water were hardly to be
had. For ladies and children accustomed to ease and comfort and plenty,
such a journey must have been a cruel experience. Sir G. O. Trevelyan
quotes an example:</p>
<p>“This is what befell Mrs. M—-, the wife of the surgeon at a certain
station on the southern confines of the insurrection. ‘I heard,’ she
says, ‘a number of shots fired, and, looking out, I saw my husband
driving furiously from the mess-house, waving his whip. I ran to him,
and, seeing a bearer with my child in his arms, I caught her up, and got
into the buggy. At the mess-house we found all the officers assembled,
together with sixty sepoys, who had remained faithful. We went off in
one large party, amidst a general conflagration of our late homes. We
reached the caravanserai at Chattapore the next morning, and thence
started for Callinger. At this point our sepoy escort deserted us. We
were fired upon by match-lockmen, and one officer was shot dead. We
heard, likewise, that the people had risen at Callinger, so we returned
and walked back ten miles that day. M—- and I carried the child
alternately. Presently Mrs. Smalley died of sunstroke. We had no food
amongst us. An officer kindly lent us a horse. We were very faint. The
Major died, and was buried; also the Sergeant-major and some women. The
bandsmen left us on the nineteenth of June. We were fired at again by
match-lockmen, and changed direction for Allahabad. Our party consisted
of nine gentlemen, two children, the sergeant and his wife. On the
morning of the twentieth, Captain Scott took Lottie on to his horse. I
was riding behind my husband, and she was so crushed between us. She was
two years old on the first of the month. We were both weak through want
of food and the effect of the sun. Lottie and I had no head covering.
M—- had a sepoy’s cap I found on the ground. Soon after sunrise we were
followed by villagers armed with clubs and spears. One of them struck
Captain Scott’s horse on the leg. He galloped off with Lottie, and my
poor husband never saw his child again. We rode on several miles,
keeping away from villages, and then crossed the river. Our thirst was
extreme. M—- had dreadful cramps, so that I had to hold him on the
horse. I was very uneasy about him. The day before I saw the drummer’s
wife eating chupatties, and asked her to give a piece to the child,
which she did. I now saw water in a ravine. The descent was steep, and
our only drinkingvessel was M—-’s cap. Our horse got water, and I bathed
my neck. I had no stockings, and my feet were torn and blistered. Two
peasants came in sight, and we were frightened and rode off. The
sergeant held our horse, and M—- put me up and mounted. I think he must
have got suddenly faint, for I fell and he over me, on the road, when
the horse started off. Some time before he said, and Barber, too, that
he could not live many hours. I felt he was dying before we came to the
ravine. He told me his wishes about his children and myself, and took
leave. My brain seemed burnt up. No tears came. As soon as we fell, the
sergeant let go the horse, and it went off; so that escape was cut off.
We sat down on the ground waiting for death. Poor fellow! he was very
weak; his thirst was frightful, and I went to get him water. Some
villagers came, and took my rupees and watch. I took off my
wedding-ring, and twisted it in my hair, and replaced the guard. I tore
off the skirt of my dress to bring water in, but was no use, for when I
returned my beloved’s eyes were fixed, and, though I called and tried to
restore him, and poured water into his mouth, it only rattled in his
throat. He never spoke to me again. I held him in my arms till he sank
gradually down. I felt frantic, but could not cry. I was alone. I bound
his head and face in my dress, for there was no earth to buy him. The
pain in my hands and feet was dreadful. I went down to the ravine, and
sat in the water on a stone, hoping to get off at night and look for
Lottie. When I came back from the water, I saw that they had not taken
her little watch, chain, and seals, so I tied them under my petticoat.
In an hour, about thirty villagers came, they dragged me out of the
ravine, and took off my jacket, and found the little chain. They then
dragged me to a village, mocking me all the way, and disputing as to
whom I was to belong to. The whole population came to look at me. I
asked for a bedstead, and lay down outside the door of a hut. They had a
dozen of cows, and yet refused me milk. When night came, and the village
was quiet, some old woman brought me a leafful of rice. I was too
parched to eat, and they gave me water. The morning after a neighboring
Rajah sent a palanquin and a horseman to fetch me, who told me that a
little child and three Sahibs had come to his master’s house. And so the
poor mother found her lost one, ’greatly blistered,’ poor little
creature. It is not for Europeans in India to pray that their flight be
not in the winter.“</p>
<p>In the first days of June the aged general, Sir Hugh Wheeler
commanding the forces at Cawnpore, was deserted by his native troops;
then he moved out of the fort and into an exposed patch of open flat
ground and built a four-foot mud wall around it. He had with him a few
hundred white soldiers and officers, and apparently more women and
children than soldiers. He was short of provisions, short of arms, short
of ammunition, short of military wisdom, short of everything but courage
and devotion to duty. The defense of that open lot through twenty-one
days and nights of hunger, thirst, Indian heat, and a never-ceasing
storm of bullets, bombs, and cannon-balls–a defense conducted, not by
the aged and infirm general, but by a young officer named Moore–is one
of the most heroic episodes in history. When at last the Nana found it
impossible to conquer these starving men and women with powder and ball,
he resorted to treachery, and that succeeded. He agreed to supply them
with food and send them to Allahabad in boats. Their mud wall and their
barracks were in ruins, their provisions were at the point of
exhaustion, they had done all that the brave could do, they had
conquered an honorable compromise,–their forces had been fearfully
reduced by casualties and by disease, they were not able to continue the
contest longer. They came forth helpless but suspecting no treachery,
the Nana’s host closed around them, and at a signal from a trumpet the
massacre began. About two hundred women and children were spared–for the
present–but all the men except three or four were killed. Among the
incidents of the massacre quoted by Sir G. O. Trevelyan, is this:</p>
<p>“When, after the lapse of some twenty minutes, the dead began to
outnumber the living;–when the fire slackened, as the marks grew few and
far between; then the troopers who had been drawn up to the right of the
temple plunged into the river, sabre between teeth, and pistol in hand.
Thereupon two half-caste Christian women, the wives of musicians in the
band of the Fifty-sixth, witnessed a scene which should not be related
at second-hand. ‘In the boat where I was to have gone,’ says
Mrs. Bradshaw, confirmed throughout by Mrs. Betts, ‘was the
school-mistress and twenty-two misses. General Wheeler came last in a
palkee. They carried him into the water near the boat. I stood close by.
He said, ’Carry me a little further towards the boat.’ But a trooper
said, ‘No, get out here.’ As the General got out of the palkee,
head-foremost, the trooper gave him a cut with his sword into the neck,
and he fell into the water. My son was killed near him. I saw it; alas!
alas! Some were stabbed with bayonets; others cut down. Little infants
were torn in pieces. We saw it; we did; and tell you only what we saw.
Other children were stabbed and thrown into the river. The schoolgirls
were burnt to death. I saw their clothes and hair catch fire. In the
water, a few paces off, by the next boat, we saw the youngest daughter
of Colonel Williams. A sepoy was going to kill her with his bayonet. She
said, ‘My father was always kind to sepoys.’ He turned away, and just
then a villager struck her on the head with a club, and she fell into
the water. These people likewise saw good Mr. Moncrieff, the clergyman,
take a book from his pocket that he never had leisure to open, and heard
him commence a prayer for mercy which he was not permitted to conclude.
Another deponent observed an European making for a drain like a scared
water-rat, when some boatmen, armed with cudgels, cut off his retreat,
and beat him down dead into the mud.“</p>
<p>The women and children who had been reserved from the massacre were
imprisoned during a fortnight in a small building, one story high–a
cramped place, a slightly modified Black Hole of Calcutta. They were
waiting in suspense; there was none who could foretaste their fate.
Meantime the news of the massacre had traveled far and an army of
rescuers with Havelock at its head was on its way–at least an army which
hoped to be rescuers. It was crossing the country by forced marches, and
strewing its way with its own dead men struck down by cholera, and by a
heat which reached 135 deg. It was in a vengeful fury, and it stopped
for nothing neither heat, nor fatigue, nor disease, nor human
opposition. It tore its impetuous way through hostile forces, winning
victory after victory, but still striding on and on, not halting to
count results. And at last, after this extraordinary march, it arrived
before the walls of Cawnpore, met the Nana’s massed strength, delivered
a crushing defeat, and entered.</p>
<p>But too late–only a few hours too late. For at the last moment the
Nana had decided upon the massacre of the captive women and children,
and had commissioned three Mohammedans and two Hindoos to do the work.
Sir G. O. Trevelyan says:</p>
<p>“Thereupon the five men entered. It was the short gloaming of
Hindostan–the hour when ladies take their evening drive. She who had
accosted the officer was standing in the doorway. With her were the
native doctor and two Hindoo menials. That much of the business might be
seen from the veranda, but all else was concealed amidst the interior
gloom. Shrieks and scuffing acquainted those without that the journeymen
were earning their hire. Survur Khan soon emerged with his sword broken
off at the hilt. He procured another from the Nana’s house, and a few
minutes after appeared again on the same errand. The third blade was of
better temper; or perhaps the thick of the work was already over. By the
time darkness had closed in, the men came forth and locked up the house
for the night. Then the screams ceased, but the groans lasted till
morning.</p>
<p>“The sun rose as usual. When he had been up nearly three hours the
five repaired to the scene of their labors over night. They were
attended by a few sweepers, who proceeded to transfer the contents of
the house to a dry well situated behind some trees which grew hard by.
‘The bodies,’ says one who was present throughout, ‘were dragged out,
most of them by the hair of the head. Those who had clothing worth
taking were stripped. Some of the women were alive. I cannot say how
many; but three could speak. They prayed for the sake of God that an end
might be put to their sufferings. I remarked one very stout woman, a
half-caste, who was severely wounded in both arms, who entreated to be
killed. She and two or three others were placed against the bank of the
cut by which bullocks go down in drawing water. The dead were first
thrown in. Yes: there was a great crowd looking on; they were standing
along the walls of the compound. They were principally city people and
villagers. Yes: there were also sepoys. Three boys were alive. They were
fair children. The eldest, I think, must have been six or seven, and the
youngest five years. They were running around the well (where else could
they go to?), and there was none to save them. No one said a word or
tried to save them.’</p>
<p>“At length the smallest of them made an infantile attempt to get
away. The little thing had been frightened past bearing by the murder of
one of the surviving ladies. He thus attracted the observation of a
native who flung him and his companions down the well.“</p>
<p>The soldiers had made a march of eighteen days, almost without rest,
to save the women and the children, and now they were too late–all were
dead and the assassin had flown. What happened then, Trevelyan hesitated
to put into words. “Of what took place, the less said is the
better.“</p>
<p>Then he continues:</p>
<p>“But there was a spectacle to witness which might excuse much. Those
who, straight from the contested field, wandered sobbing through the
rooms of the ladies’ house, saw what it were well could the outraged
earth have straightway hidden. The inner apartment was ankle-deep in
blood. The plaster was scored with sword-cuts; not high up as where men
have fought, but low down, and about the corners, as if a creature had
crouched to avoid the blow. Strips of dresses, vainly tied around the
handles of the doors, signified the contrivance to which feminine
despair had resorted as a means of keeping out the murderers. Broken
combs were there, and the frills of children’s trousers, and torn cuffs
and pinafores, and little round hats, and one or two shoes with burst
latchets, and one or two daguerreotype cases with cracked glasses. An
officer picked up a few curls, preserved in a bit of cardboard, and
marked ‘Ned’s hair, with love’; but around were strewn locks, some near
a yard in length, dissevered, not as a keepsake, by quite other
scissors.“</p>
<p>The battle of Waterloo was fought on the 18th of June, 1815. I do not
state this fact as a reminder to the reader, but as news to him. For a
forgotten fact is news when it comes again. Writers of books have the
fashion of whizzing by vast and renowned historical events with the
remark, “The details of this tremendous episode are too familiar to the
reader to need repeating here.“ They know that that is not true. It is a
low kind of flattery. They know that the reader has forgotten every
detail of it, and that nothing of the tremendous event is left in his
mind but a vague and formless luminous smudge. Aside from the desire to
flatter the reader, they have another reason for making the remark-two
reasons, indeed. They do not remember the details themselves, and do not
want the trouble of hunting them up and copying them out; also, they are
afraid that if they search them out and print them they will be scoffed
at by the book-reviewers for retelling those worn old things which are
familiar to everybody. They should not mind the reviewer’s jeer; he
doesn’t remember any of the worn old things until the book which he is
reviewing has retold them to him.</p>
<p>I have made the quoted remark myself, at one time and another, but I
was not doing it to flatter the reader; I was merely doing it to save
work. If I had known the details without brushing up, I would have put
them in; but I didn’t, and I did not want the labor of posting myself;
so I said, “The details of this tremendous episode are too familiar to
the reader to need repeating here.“ I do not like that kind of a lie;
still, it does save work.</p>
<p>I am not trying to get out of repeating the details of the Siege of
Lucknow in fear of the reviewer; I am not leaving them out in fear that
they would not interest the reader; I am leaving them out partly to save
work; mainly for lack of room. It is a pity, too; for there is not a
dull place anywhere in the great story.</p>
<p>Ten days before the outbreak (May 10th) of the Mutiny, all was serene
at Lucknow, the huge capital of Oudh, the kingdom which had recently
been seized by the India Company. There was a great garrison, composed
of about 7,000 native troops and between 700 and 800 whites. These white
soldiers and their families were probably the only people of their race
there; at their elbow was that swarming population of warlike natives, a
race of born soldiers, brave, daring, and fond of fighting. On high
ground just outside the city stood the palace of that great personage,
the Resident, the representative of British power and authority. It
stood in the midst of spacious grounds, with its due complement of
outbuildings, and the grounds were enclosed by a wall–a wall not for
defense, but for privacy. The mutinous spirit was in the air, but the
whites were not afraid, and did not feel much troubled.</p>
<p>Then came the outbreak at Meerut, then the capture of Delhi by the
mutineers; in June came the three-weeks leaguer of Sir Hugh Wheeler in
his open lot at Cawnpore–40 miles distant from Lucknow–then the
treacherous massacre of that gallant little garrison; and now the great
revolt was in full flower, and the comfortable condition of things at
Lucknow was instantly changed.</p>
<p>There was an outbreak there, and Sir Henry Lawrence marched out of
the Residency on the 30th of June to put it down, but was defeated with
heavy loss, and had difficulty in getting back again. That night the
memorable siege of the Residency–called the siege of Lucknow–began. Sir
Henry was killed three days later, and Brigadier Inglis succeeded him in
command.</p>
<p>Outside of the Residency fence was an immense host of hostile and
confident native besiegers; inside it were 480 loyal native soldiers,
730 white ones, and 500 women and children.</p>
<p>In those days the English garrisons always managed to hamper
themselves sufficiently with women and children.</p>
<p>The natives established themselves in houses close at hand and began
to rain bullets and cannon-balls into the Residency; and this they kept
up, night and day, during four months and a half, the little garrison
industriously replying all the time. The women and children soon became
so used to the roar of the guns that it ceased to disturb their sleep.
The children imitated siege and defense in their play. The women–with
any pretext, or with none–would sally out into the storm-swept grounds.
The defense was kept up week after week, with stubborn fortitude, in the
midst of death, which came in many forms–by bullet, small-pox, cholera,
and by various diseases induced by unpalatable and insufficient food, by
the long hours of wearying and exhausting overwork in the daily and
nightly battle in the oppressive Indian heat, and by the broken rest
caused by the intolerable pest of mosquitoes, flies, mice, rats, and
fleas.</p>
<p>Six weeks after the beginning of the siege more than one-half of the
original force of white soldiers was dead, and close upon three-fifths
of the original native force.</p>
<p>But the fighting went on just the same. The enemy mined, the English
counter-mined, and, turn about, they blew up each other’s posts. The
Residency grounds were honey-combed with the enemy’s tunnels. Deadly
courtesies were constantly exchanged–sorties by the English in the
night; rushes by the enemy in the night–rushes whose purpose was to
breach the walls or scale them; rushes which cost heavily, and always
failed.</p>
<p>The ladies got used to all the horrors of war–the shrieks of
mutilated men, the sight of blood and death. Lady Inglis makes this
mention in her diary:</p>
<p>“Mrs. Bruere’s nurse was carried past our door to-day, wounded in the
eye. To extract the bullet it was found necessary to take out the eye–a
fearful operation. Her mistress held her while it was performed.“</p>
<p>The first relieving force failed to relieve. It was under Havelock
and Outram; and arrived when the siege had been going on for three
months. It fought its desperate way to Lucknow, then fought its way
through the city against odds of a hundred to one, and entered the
Residency; but there was not enough left of it, then, to do any good. It
lost more men in its last fight than it found in the Residency when it
got in. It became captive itself.</p>
<p>The fighting and starving and dying by bullets and disease went
steadily on. Both sides fought with energy and industry. Captain Birch
puts this striking incident in evidence. He is speaking of the third
month of the siege:</p>
<p>“As an instance of the heavy firing brought to bear on our position
this month may be mentioned the cutting down of the upper story of a
brick building simply by musketry firring. This building was in a most
exposed position. All the shots which just missed the top of the rampart
cut into the dead wall pretty much in a straight line, and at length cut
right through and brought the upper story tumbling down. The upper
structure on the top of the brigade-mess also fell in. The Residency
house was a wreck. Captain Anderson’s post had long ago been knocked
down, and Innes’ post also fell in. These two were riddled with round
shot. As many as 200 were picked up by Colonel Masters.“</p>
<p>The exhausted garrison fought doggedly on all through the next month
October. Then, November 2d, news came Sir Colin Campbell’s relieving
force would soon be on its way from Cawnpore.</p>
<p>On the 12th the boom of his guns was heard.</p>
<p>On the 13th the sounds came nearer–he was slowly, but steadily,
cutting his way through, storming one stronghold after another.</p>
<p>On the 14th he captured the Martiniere College, and ran up the
British flag there. It was seen from the Residency.</p>
<p>Next he took the Dilkoosha.</p>
<p>On the 17th he took the former mess-house of the 32d regiment–a
fortified building, and very strong. “A most exciting, anxious day,“
writes Lady Inglis in her diary. “About 4 P.M., two strange officers
walked through our yard, leading their horses“–and by that sign she knew
that communication was established between the forces, that the relief
was real, this time, and that the long siege of Lucknow was ended.</p>
<p>The last eight or ten miles of Sir Colin Campbell’s march was through
seas of, blood. The weapon mainly used was the bayonet, the fighting was
desperate. The way was mile-stoned with detached strong buildings of
stone, fortified, and heavily garrisoned, and these had to be taken by
assault. Neither side asked for quarter, and neither gave it. At the
Secundrabagh, where nearly two thousand of the enemy occupied a great
stone house in a garden, the work of slaughter was continued until every
man was killed. That is a sample of the character of that devastating
march.</p>
<p>There were but few trees in the plain at that time, and from the
Residency the progress of the march, step by step, victory by victory,
could be noted; the ascending clouds of battle-smoke marked the way to
the eye, and the thunder of the guns marked it to the ear.</p>
<p>Sir Colin Campbell had not come to Lucknow to hold it, but to save
the occupants of the Residency, and bring them away. Four or five days
after his arrival the secret evacuation by the troops took place, in the
middle of a dark night, by the principal gate, (the Bailie Guard). The
two hundred women and two hundred and fifty children had been previously
removed. Captain Birch says:</p>
<p>“And now commenced a movement of the most perfect arrangement and
successful generalship–the withdrawal of the whole of the various
forces, a combined movement requiring the greatest care and skill.
First, the garrison in immediate contact with the enemy at the furthest
extremity of the Residency position was marched out. Every other
garrison in turn fell in behind it, and so passed out through the Bailie
Guard gate, till the whole of our position was evacuated. Then
Havelock’s force was similarly withdrawn, post by post, marching in rear
of our garrison. After them in turn came the forces of the
Commander-in-Chief, which joined on in the rear of Havelock’s force.
Regiment by regiment was withdrawn with–the utmost order and regularity.
The whole operation resembled the movement of a telescope. Stern silence
was kept, and the enemy took no alarm.“</p>
<p>Lady Inglis, referring to her husband and to General Sir James
Outram, sets down the closing detail of this impressive midnight
retreat, in darkness and by stealth, of this shadowy host through the
gate which it had defended so long and so well:</p>
<p>“At twelve precisely they marched out, John and Sir James Outram
remaining till all had passed, and then they took off their hats to the
Bailie Guard, the scene of as noble a defense as I think history will
ever have to relate.“</p>
