<h4 id="chapter-57-an-archangel">Chapter 57 An Archangel</h4>
<p>FROM St. Louis northward there are all the enlivening signs of the
presence of active, energetic, intelligent, prosperous, practical
nineteenth-century populations. The people don’t dream, they work. The
happy result is manifest all around in the substantial outside aspect of
things, and the suggestions of wholesome life and comfort that
everywhere appear.</p>
<p>Quincy is a notable example–a brisk, handsome, well-ordered city; and
now, as formerly, interested in art, letters, and other high things.</p>
<p>But Marion City is an exception. Marion City has gone backwards in a
most unaccountable way. This metropolis promised so well that the
projectors tacked ‘city’ to its name in the very beginning, with full
confidence; but it was bad prophecy. When I first saw Marion City,
thirty-five years ago, it contained one street, and nearly or quite six
houses. It contains but one house now, and this one, in a state of ruin,
is getting ready to follow the former five into the river. Doubtless
Marion City was too near to Quincy. It had another disadvantage: it was
situated in a flat mud bottom, below high-water mark, whereas Quincy
stands high up on the slope of a hill.</p>
<p>In the beginning Quincy had the aspect and ways of a model New
England town: and these she has yet: broad, clean streets, trim, neat
dwellings and lawns, fine mansions, stately blocks of commercial
buildings. And there are ample fair-grounds, a well kept park, and many
attractive drives; library, reading-rooms, a couple of colleges, some
handsome and costly churches, and a grand court-house, with grounds
which occupy a square. The population of the city is thirty thousand.
There are some large factories here, and manufacturing, of many sorts,
is done on a great scale.</p>
<p>La Grange and Canton are growing towns, but I missed Alexandria; was
told it was under water, but would come up to blow in the summer.</p>
<p>Keokuk was easily recognizable. I lived there in 1857–an
extraordinary year there in real-estate matters. The ‘boom’ was
something wonderful. Everybody bought, everybody sold–except widows and
preachers; they always hold on; and when the tide ebbs, they get left.
Anything in the semblance of a town lot, no matter how situated, was
salable, and at a figure which would still have been high if the ground
had been sodded with greenbacks.</p>
<p>The town has a population of fifteen thousand now, and is progressing
with a healthy growth. It was night, and we could not see details, for
which we were sorry, for Keokuk has the reputation of being a beautiful
city. It was a pleasant one to live in long ago, and doubtless has
advanced, not retrograded, in that respect.</p>
<p>A mighty work which was in progress there in my day is finished now.
This is the canal over the Rapids. It is eight miles long, three hundred
feet wide, and is in no place less than six feet deep. Its masonry is of
the majestic kind which the War Department usually deals in, and will
endure like a Roman aqueduct. The work cost four or five millions.</p>
<p>After an hour or two spent with former friends, we started up the
river again. Keokuk, a long time ago, was an occasional loafing-place of
that erratic genius, Henry Clay Dean. I believe I never saw him but
once; but he was much talked of when I lived there. This is what was
said of him–</p>
<p>He began life poor and without education. But he educated himself–on
the curbstones of Keokuk. He would sit down on a curbstone with his
book, careless or unconscious of the clatter of commerce and the tramp
of the passing crowds, and bury himself in his studies by the hour,
never changing his position except to draw in his knees now and then to
let a dray pass unobstructed; and when his book was finished, its
contents, however abstruse, had been burnt into his memory, and were his
permanent possession. In this way he acquired a vast hoard of all sorts
of learning, and had it pigeon-holed in his head where he could put his
intellectual hand on it whenever it was wanted.</p>
<p>His clothes differed in no respect from a ‘wharf-rat’s,’ except that
they were raggeder, more ill-assorted and inharmonious (and therefore
more extravagantly picturesque), and several layers dirtier. Nobody
could infer the master-mind in the top of that edifice from the edifice
itself.</p>
<p>He was an orator–by nature in the first place, and later by the
training of experience and practice. When he was out on a canvass, his
name was a lodestone which drew the farmers to his stump from fifty
miles around. His theme was always politics. He used no notes, for a
volcano does not need notes. In 1862, a son of Keokuk’s late
distinguished citizen, Mr. Claggett, gave me this incident concerning
Dean–</p>
<p>The war feeling was running high in Keokuk (in ’61), and a great mass
meeting was to be held on a certain day in the new Athenaeum. A
distinguished stranger was to address the house. After the building had
been packed to its utmost capacity with sweltering folk of both sexes,
the stage still remained vacant–the distinguished stranger had failed to
connect. The crowd grew impatient, and by and by indignant and
rebellious. About this time a distressed manager discovered Dean on a
curb-stone, explained the dilemma to him, took his book away from him,
rushed him into the building the back way, and told him to make for the
stage and save his country.</p>
<p>Presently a sudden silence fell upon the grumbling audience, and
everybody’s eyes sought a single point–the wide, empty, carpetless
stage. A figure appeared there whose aspect was familiar to hardly a
dozen persons present. It was the scarecrow Dean–in foxy shoes, down at
the heels; socks of odd colors, also ‘down;’ damaged trousers, relics of
antiquity, and a world too short, exposing some inches of naked ankle;
an unbuttoned vest, also too short, and exposing a zone of soiled and
wrinkled linen between it and the waistband; shirt bosom open; long
black handkerchief, wound round and round the neck like a bandage; bob-
tailed blue coat, reaching down to the small of the back, with sleeves
which left four inches of forearm unprotected; small, stiff-brimmed
soldier-cap hung on a corner of the bump of–whichever bump it was. This
figure moved gravely out upon the stage and, with sedate and measured
step, down to the front, where it paused, and dreamily inspected the
house, saying no word. The silence of surprise held its own for a
moment, then was broken by a just audible ripple of merriment which
swept the sea of faces like the wash of a wave. The figure remained as
before, thoughtfully inspecting. Another wave started– laughter, this
time. It was followed by another, then a third–this last one
boisterous.</p>
<p>And now the stranger stepped back one pace, took off his soldier-cap,
tossed it into the wing, and began to speak, with deliberation, nobody
listening, everybody laughing and whispering. The speaker talked on
unembarrassed, and presently delivered a shot which went home, and
silence and attention resulted. He followed it quick and fast, with
other telling things; warmed to his work and began to pour his words
out, instead of dripping them; grew hotter and hotter, and fell to
discharging lightnings and thunder–and now the house began to break into
applause, to which the speaker gave no heed, but went hammering straight
on; unwound his black bandage and cast it away, still thundering;
presently discarded the bob tailed coat and flung it aside, firing up
higher and higher all the time; finally flung the vest after the coat;
and then for an untimed period stood there, like another Vesuvius,
spouting smoke and flame, lava and ashes, raining pumice-stone and
cinders, shaking the moral earth with intellectual crash upon crash,
explosion upon explosion, while the mad multitude stood upon their feet
in a solid body, answering back with a ceaseless hurricane of cheers,
through a thrashing snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>‘When Dean came,’ said Claggett, ‘the people thought he was an
escaped lunatic; but when he went, they thought he was an escaped
archangel.’</p>
<p>Burlington, home of the sparkling Burdette, is another hill city; and
also a beautiful one; unquestionably so; a fine and flourishing city,
with a population of twenty-five thousand, and belted with busy
factories of nearly every imaginable description. It was a very sober
city, too–for the moment–for a most sobering bill was pending; a bill to
forbid the manufacture, exportation, importation, purchase, sale,
borrowing, lending, stealing, drinking, smelling, or possession, by
conquest, inheritance, intent, accident, or otherwise, in the State of
Iowa, of each and every deleterious beverage known to the human race,
except water. This measure was approved by all the rational people in
the State; but not by the bench of Judges.</p>
<p>Burlington has the progressive modern city’s full equipment of
devices for right and intelligent government; including a paid fire
department, a thing which the great city of New Orleans is without, but
still employs that relic of antiquity, the independent system.</p>
<p>In Burlington, as in all these Upper-River towns, one breathes a
go-ahead atmosphere which tastes good in the nostrils. An opera-house
has lately been built there which is in strong contrast with the shabby
dens which usually do duty as theaters in cities of Burlington’s
size.</p>
<p>We had not time to go ashore in Muscatine, but had a daylight view of
it from the boat. I lived there awhile, many years ago, but the place,
now, had a rather unfamiliar look; so I suppose it has clear outgrown
the town which I used to know. In fact, I know it has; for I remember it
as a small place–which it isn’t now. But I remember it best for a
lunatic who caught me out in the fields, one Sunday, and extracted a
butcher-knife from his boot and proposed to carve me up with it, unless
I acknowledged him to be the only son of the Devil. I tried to
compromise on an acknowledgment that he was the only member of the
family I had met; but that did not satisfy him; he wouldn’t have any
half-measures; I must say he was the sole and only son of the Devil–he
whetted his knife on his boot. It did not seem worth while to make
trouble about a little thing like that; so I swung round to his view of
the matter and saved my skin whole. Shortly afterward, he went to visit
his father; and as he has not turned up since, I trust he is there
yet.</p>
<p>And I remember Muscatine–still more pleasantly–for its summer
sunsets. I have never seen any, on either side of the ocean, that
equaled them. They used the broad smooth river as a canvas, and painted
on it every imaginable dream of color, from the mottled daintinesses and
delicacies of the opal, all the way up, through cumulative intensities,
to blinding purple and crimson conflagrations which were enchanting to
the eye, but sharply tried it at the same time. All the Upper
Mississippi region has these extraordinary sunsets as a familiar
spectacle. It is the true Sunset Land: I am sure no other country can
show so good a right to the name. The sunrises are also said to be
exceedingly fine. I do not know.</p>
