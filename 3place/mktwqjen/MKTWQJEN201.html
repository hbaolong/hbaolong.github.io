<h4 id="chapter-lix.">CHAPTER LIX.</h4>
<p>When Mr. Noble’s bombshell fell, in Senator Dilworthy’s camp, the
statesman was disconcerted for a moment. For a moment; that was all. The
next moment he was calmly up and doing. From the centre of our country
to its circumference, nothing was talked of but Mr. Noble’s terrible
revelation, and the people were furious. Mind, they were not furious
because bribery was uncommon in our public life, but merely because here
was another case. Perhaps it did not occur to the nation of good and
worthy people that while they continued to sit comfortably at home and
leave the true source of our political power (the “primaries,“) in the
hands of saloon-keepers, dog-fanciers and hod-carriers, they could go on
expecting “another“ case of this kind, and even dozens and hundreds of
them, and never be disappointed. However, they may have thought that to
sit at home and grumble would some day right the evil.</p>
<p>Yes, the nation was excited, but Senator Dilworthy was calm–what was
left of him after the explosion of the shell. Calm, and up and doing.
What did he do first? What would you do first, after you had tomahawked
your mother at the breakfast table for putting too much sugar in your
coffee? You would “ask for a suspension of public opinion.“ That is what
Senator Dilworthy did. It is the custom. He got the usual amount of
suspension. Far and wide he was called a thief, a briber, a promoter of
steamship subsidies, railway swindles, robberies of the government in
all possible forms and fashions. Newspapers and everybody else called
him a pious hypocrite, a sleek, oily fraud, a reptile who manipulated
temperance movements, prayer meetings, Sunday schools, public charities,
missionary enterprises, all for his private benefit. And as these
charges were backed up by what seemed to be good and sufficient,
evidence, they were believed with national unanimity.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Dilworthy made another move. He moved instantly to
Washington and “demanded an investigation.“ Even this could not pass
without, comment. Many papers used language to this effect:</p>
<p>“Senator Dilworthy’s remains have demanded an investigation. This
sounds fine and bold and innocent; but when we reflect that they demand
it at the hands of the Senate of the United States, it simply becomes
matter for derision. One might as well set the gentlemen detained in the
public prisons to trying each other. This investigation is likely to be
like all other Senatorial investigations–amusing but not useful. Query.
Why does the Senate still stick to this pompous word, ‘Investigation?’
One does not blindfold one’s self in order to investigate an
object.“</p>
<p>Mr. Dilworthy appeared in his place in the Senate and offered a
resolution appointing a committee to investigate his case. It carried,
of course, and the committee was appointed. Straightway the newspapers
said:</p>
<p>“Under the guise of appointing a committee to investigate the late
Mr. Dilworthy, the Senate yesterday appointed a committee to investigate
his accuser, Mr. Noble. This is the exact spirit and meaning of the
resolution, and the committee cannot try anybody but Mr. Noble without
overstepping its authority. That Dilworthy had the effrontery to offer
such a resolution will surprise no one, and that the Senate could
entertain it without blushing and pass it without shame will surprise no
one. We are now reminded of a note which we have received from the
notorious burglar Murphy, in which he finds fault with a statement of
ours to the effect that he had served one term in the penitentiary and
also one in the U. S. Senate. He says, ‘The latter statement is untrue
and does me great injustice.’ After an unconscious sarcasm like that,
further comment is unnecessary.“</p>
<p>And yet the Senate was roused by the Dilworthy trouble. Many speeches
were made. One Senator (who was accused in the public prints of selling
his chances of re-election to his opponent for 0,000 and had not yet
denied the charge) said that, “the presence in the Capital of such a
creature as this man Noble, to testify against a brother member of their
body, was an insult to the Senate.“</p>
<p>Another Senator said, “Let the investigation go on and let it make an
example of this man Noble; let it teach him and men like him that they
could not attack the reputation of a United States-Senator with
impunity.“</p>
<p>Another said he was glad the investigation was to be had, for it was
high time that the Senate should crush some cur like this man Noble, and
thus show his kind that it was able and resolved to uphold its ancient
dignity.</p>
<p>A by-stander laughed, at this finely delivered peroration; and
said:</p>
<p>“Why, this is the Senator who franked his, baggage home through the
mails last week-registered, at that. However, perhaps he was merely
engaged in ‘upholding the ancient dignity of the Senate,’–then.“</p>
<p>“No, the modern dignity of it,“ said another by-stander. “It don’t
resemble its ancient dignity but it fits its modern style like a
glove.“</p>
<p>There being no law against making offensive remarks about U. S.
Senators, this conversation, and others like it, continued without let
or hindrance. But our business is with the investigating committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Noble appeared before the Committee of the Senate; and testified
to the following effect:</p>
<p>He said that he was a member of the State legislature of the
Happy-Land-of-Canaan; that on the — day of —— he assembled himself
together at the city of Saint’s Rest, the capital of the State, along
with his brother legislators; that he was known to be a political enemy
of Mr. Dilworthy and bitterly opposed to his re-election; that
Mr. Dilworthy came to Saint’s Rest and reported to be buying pledges of
votes with money; that the said Dilworthy sent for him to come to his
room in the hotel at night, and he went; was introduced to
Mr. Dilworthy; called two or three times afterward at Dilworthy’s
request–usually after midnight; Mr. Dilworthy urged him to vote for him
Noble declined; Dilworthy argued; said he was bound to be elected, and
could then ruin him (Noble) if he voted no; said he had every railway
and every public office and stronghold of political power in the State
under his thumb, and could set up or pull down any man he chose; gave
instances showing where and how he had used this power; if Noble would
vote for him he would make him a Representative in Congress; Noble still
declined to vote, and said he did not believe Dilworthy was going to be
elected; Dilworthy showed a list of men who would vote for him–a
majority of the legislature; gave further proofs of his power by telling
Noble everything the opposing party had done or said in secret caucus;
claimed that his spies reported everything to him, and that–</p>
<p>Here a member of the Committee objected that this evidence was
irrelevant and also in opposition to the spirit of the Committee’s
instructions, because if these things reflected upon any one it was upon
Mr. Dilworthy. The chairman said, let the person proceed with his
statement–the Committee could exclude evidence that did not bear upon
the case.</p>
<p>Mr. Noble continued. He said that his party would cast him out if he
voted for Mr, Dilworthy; Dilwortby said that that would inure to his
benefit because he would then be a recognized friend of his
(Dilworthy’s) and he could consistently exalt him politically and make
his fortune; Noble said he was poor, and it was hard to tempt him so;
Dilworthy said he would fix that; he said, “Tell, me what you want, and
say you will vote for me;“ Noble could not say; Dilworthy said “I will
give you ,000.“</p>
<p>A Committee man said, impatiently, that this stuff was all outside
the case, and valuable time was being wasted; this was all, a plain
reflection upon a brother Senator. The Chairman said it was the quickest
way to proceed, and the evidence need have no weight.</p>
<p>Mr. Noble continued. He said he told Dilworthy that ,000 was not much
to pay for a man’s honor, character and everything that was worth
having; Dilworthy said he was surprised; he considered ,000 a
fortune–for some men; asked what Noble’s figure was; Noble said he could
not think 0,000 too little; Dilworthy said it was a great deal too much;
he would not do it for any other man, but he had conceived a liking for
Noble, and where he liked a man his heart yearned to help him; he was
aware that Noble was poor, and had a family to support, and that he bore
an unblemished reputation at home; for such a man and such a man’s
influence he could do much, and feel that to help such a man would be an
act that would have its reward; the struggles of the poor always touched
him; he believed that Noble would make a good use of this money and that
it would cheer many a sad heart and needy home; he would give the,
0,000; all he desired in return was that when the balloting began, Noble
should cast his vote for him and should explain to the legislature that
upon looking into the charges against Mr. Dilworthy of bribery,
corruption, and forwarding stealing measures in Congress he had found
them to be base calumnies upon a man whose motives were pure and whose
character was stainless; he then took from his pocket ,000 in bank bills
and handed them to Noble, and got another package containing ,000 out of
his trunk and gave to him also. He—-</p>
<p>A Committee man jumped up, and said:</p>
<p>“At last, Mr. Chairman, this shameless person has arrived at the
point. This is sufficient and conclusive. By his own confession he has
received a bribe, and did it deliberately.</p>
<p>“This is a grave offense, and cannot be passed over in silence, sir.
By the terms of our instructions we can now proceed to mete out to him
such punishment as is meet for one who has maliciously brought
disrespect upon a Senator of the United States. We have no need to hear
the rest of his evidence.“</p>
<p>The Chairman said it would be better and more regular to proceed with
the investigation according to the usual forms. A note would be made of
Mr. Noble’s admission.</p>
<p>Mr. Noble continued. He said that it was now far past midnight; that
he took his leave and went straight to certain legislators, told them
everything, made them count the money, and also told them of the
exposure he would make in joint convention; he made that exposure, as
all the world knew. The rest of the 0,000 was to be paid the day after
Dilworthy was elected.</p>
<p>Senator Dilworthy was now asked to take the stand and tell what he
knew about the man Noble. The Senator wiped his mouth with his
handkerchief, adjusted his white cravat, and said that but for the fact
that public morality required an example, for the warning of future
Nobles, he would beg that in Christian charity this poor misguided
creature might be forgiven and set free. He said that it was but too
evident that this person had approached him in the hope of obtaining a
bribe; he had intruded himself time and again, and always with moving
stories of his poverty. Mr. Dilworthy said that his heart had bled for
him–insomuch that he had several times been on the point of trying to
get some one to do something for him. Some instinct had told him from
the beginning that this was a bad man, an evil-minded man, but his
inexperience of such had blinded him to his real motives, and hence he
had never dreamed that his object was to undermine the purity of a
United States Senator. He regretted that it was plain, now, that such
was the man’s object and that punishment could not with safety to the
Senate’s honor be withheld. He grieved to say that one of those
mysterious dispensations of an inscrutable Providence which are decreed
from time to time by His wisdom and for His righteous, purposes, had
given this conspirator’s tale a color of plausibility,–but this would
soon disappear under the clear light of truth which would now be thrown
upon the case.</p>
<p>It so happened, (said the Senator,) that about the time in question,
a poor young friend of mine, living in a distant town of my State,
wished to establish a bank; he asked me to lend him the necessary money;
I said I had no, money just then, but world try to borrow it. The day
before the election a friend said to me that my election expenses must
be very large specially my hotel bills, and offered to lend me some
money. Remembering my young, friend, I said I would like a few thousands
now, and a few more by and by; whereupon he gave me two packages of
bills said to contain ,000 and ,000 respectively; I did not open the
packages or count the money; I did not give any note or receipt for the
same; I made no memorandum of the transaction, and neither did my
friend. That night this evil man Noble came troubling me again: I could
not rid myself of him, though my time was very precious. He mentioned my
young friend and said he was very anxious to have the 000 now to begin
his banking operations with, and could wait a while for the rest. Noble
wished to get the money and take it to him. I finally gave him the two
packages of bills; I took no note or receipt from him, and made no
memorandum of the matter. I no more look for duplicity and deception in
another man than I would look for it in myself. I never thought of this
man again until I was overwhelmed the next day by learning what a
shameful use he had made of the confidence I had reposed in him and the
money I had entrusted to his care. This is all, gentlemen. To the
absolute truth of every detail of my statement I solemnly swear, and I
call Him to witness who is the Truth and the loving Father of all whose
lips abhor false speaking; I pledge my honor as a Senator, that I have
spoken but the truth. May God forgive this wicked man as I do.</p>
<p>Mr. Noble–“Senator Dilworthy, your bank account shows that up to that
day, and even on that very day, you conducted all your financial
business through the medium of checks instead of bills, and so kept
careful record of every moneyed transaction. Why did you deal in bank
bills on this particular occasion?“</p>
<p>The Chairman–“The gentleman will please to remember that the
Committee is conducting this investigation.“</p>
<p>Mr. Noble–“Then will the Committee ask the question?“</p>
<p>The Chairman–“The Committee will–when it desires to know.“</p>
<p>Mr. Noble–“Which will not be daring this century perhaps.“</p>
<p>The Chairman–“Another remark like that, sir, will procure you the
attentions of the Sergeant-at-arms.“</p>
<p>Mr. Noble–“D–n the Sergeant-at-arms, and the Committee too!“</p>
<p>Several Committeemen–“Mr. Chairman, this is Contempt!“</p>
<p>Mr. Noble–“Contempt of whom?“</p>
<p>“Of the Committee! Of the Senate of the United States!“</p>
<p>Mr. Noble–“Then I am become the acknowledged representative of a
nation. You know as well as I do that the whole nation hold as much as
three-fifths of the United States Senate in entire
contempt.–Three-fifths of you are Dilworthys.“</p>
<p>The Sergeant-at-arms very soon put a quietus upon the observations of
the representative of the nation, and convinced him that he was not, in
the over-free atmosphere of his Happy-Land-of-Canaan:</p>
<p>The statement of Senator Dilworthy naturally carried conviction to
the minds of the committee.–It was close, logical, unanswerable; it bore
many internal evidences of its, truth. For instance, it is customary in
all countries for business men to loan large sums of money in bank bills
instead of checks. It is customary for the lender to make no memorandum
of the transaction. It is customary, for the borrower to receive the
money without making a memorandum of it, or giving a note or a receipt
for it’s use–the borrower is not likely to die or forget about it. It is
customary to lend nearly anybody money to start a bank with especially
if you have not the money to lend him and have to borrow it for the
purpose. It is customary to carry large sums of money in bank bills
about your person or in your trunk. It is customary to hand a large sure
in bank bills to a man you have just been introduced to (if he asks you
to do it,) to be conveyed to a distant town and delivered to another
party. It is not customary to make a memorandum of this transaction; it
is not customary for the conveyor to give a note or a receipt for the
money; it is not customary to require that he shall get a note or a
receipt from the man he is to convey it to in the distant town. It would
be at least singular in you to say to the proposed conveyor, “You might
be robbed; I will deposit the money in a bank and send a check for it to
my friend through the mail.“</p>
<p>Very well. It being plain that Senator Dilworthy’s statement was
rigidly true, and this fact being strengthened by his adding to it the
support of “his honor as a Senator,“ the Committee rendered a verdict of
“Not proven that a bribe had been offered and accepted.“ This in a
manner exonerated Noble and let him escape.</p>
<p>The Committee made its report to the Senate, and that body proceeded
to consider its acceptance. One Senator indeed, several
Senators–objected that the Committee had failed of its duty; they had
proved this man Noble guilty of nothing, they had meted out no
punishment to him; if the report were accepted, he would go forth free
and scathless, glorying in his crime, and it would be a tacit admission
that any blackguard could insult the Senate of the United States and
conspire against the sacred reputation of its members with impunity; the
Senate owed it to the upholding of its ancient dignity to make an
example of this man Noble –he should be crushed.</p>
<p>An elderly Senator got up and took another view of the case. This was
a Senator of the worn-out and obsolete pattern; a man still lingering
among the cobwebs of the past, and behind the spirit of the age. He said
that there seemed to be a curious misunderstanding of the case.
Gentlemen seemed exceedingly anxious to preserve and maintain the honor
and dignity of the Senate.</p>
<p>Was this to be done by trying an obscure adventurer for attempting to
trap a Senator into bribing him? Or would not the truer way be to find
out whether the Senator was capable of being entrapped into so shameless
an act, and then try him? Why, of course. Now the whole idea of the
Senate seemed to be to shield the Senator and turn inquiry away from
him. The true way to uphold the honor of the Senate was to have none but
honorable men in its body. If this Senator had yielded to temptation and
had offered a bribe, he was a soiled man and ought to be instantly
expelled; therefore he wanted the Senator tried, and not in the usual
namby-pamby way, but in good earnest. He wanted to know the truth of
this matter. For himself, he believed that the guilt of Senator
Dilworthy was established beyond the shadow of a doubt; and he
considered that in trifling with his case and shirking it the Senate was
doing a shameful and cowardly thing–a thing which suggested that in its
willingness to sit longer in the company of such a man, it was
acknowledging that it was itself of a kind with him and was therefore
not dishonored by his presence. He desired that a rigid examination be
made into Senator Dilworthy’s case, and that it be continued clear into
the approaching extra session if need be. There was no dodging this
thing with the lame excuse of want of time.</p>
<p>In reply, an honorable Senator said that he thought it would be as
well to drop the matter and accept the Committee’s report. He said with
some jocularity that the more one agitated this thing, the worse it was
for the agitator. He was not able to deny that he believed Senator
Dilworthy to be guilty–but what then? Was it such an extraordinary case?
For his part, even allowing the Senator to be guilty, he did not think
his continued presence during the few remaining days of the Session
would contaminate the Senate to a dreadful degree. [This humorous sally
was received with smiling admiration–notwithstanding it was not wholly
new, having originated with the Massachusetts General in the House a day
or two before, upon the occasion of the proposed expulsion of a member
for selling his vote for money.]</p>
<p>The Senate recognized the fact that it could not be contaminated by
sitting a few days longer with Senator Dilworthy, and so it accepted the
committee’s report and dropped the unimportant matter.</p>
<p>Mr. Dilworthy occupied his seat to the last hour of the session. He
said that his people had reposed a trust in him, and it was not for him
to desert them. He would remain at his post till he perished, if need
be.</p>
<p>His voice was lifted up and his vote cast for the last time, in
support of an ingenious measure contrived by the General from
Massachusetts whereby the President’s salary was proposed to be doubled
and every Congressman paid several thousand dollars extra for work
previously done, under an accepted contract, and already paid for once
and receipted for.</p>
<p>Senator Dilworthy was offered a grand ovation by his friends at home,
who said that their affection for him and their confidence in him were
in no wise impaired by the persecutions that had pursued him, and that
he was still good enough for them.</p>
<p>–[The ,000 left by Mr. Noble with his state legislature was placed in
safe keeping to await the claim of the legitimate owner. Senator
Dilworthy made one little effort through his protege the embryo banker
to recover it, but there being no notes of hand or, other memoranda to
support the claim, it failed. The moral of which is, that when one loans
money to start a bank with, one ought to take the party’s written
acknowledgment of the fact.]</p>
