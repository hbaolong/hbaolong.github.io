<h4 id="chapter-xvi.">CHAPTER XVI.</h4>
<p>There is a Moral sense, and there is an Immoral Sense. History shows
us that the Moral Sense enables us to perceive morality and how to avoid
it, and that the Immoral Sense enables us to perceive immorality and how
to enjoy it. -Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>Melbourne spreads around over an immense area of ground. It is a
stately city architecturally as well as in magnitude. It has an
elaborate system of cable-car service; it has museums, and colleges, and
schools, and public gardens, and electricity, and gas, and libraries,
and theaters, and mining centers, and wool centers, and centers of the
arts and sciences, and boards of trade, and ships, and railroads, and a
harbor, and social clubs, and journalistic clubs, and racing clubs, and
a squatter club sumptuously housed and appointed, and as many churches
and banks as can make a living. In a word, it is equipped with
everything that goes to make the modern great city. It is the largest
city of Australasia, and fills the post with honor and credit. It has
one specialty; this must not be jumbled in with those other things. It
is the mitred Metropolitan of the Horse-Racing Cult. Its race-ground is
the Mecca of Australasia. On the great annual day of sacrifice–the 5th
of November, Guy Fawkes’s Day–business is suspended over a stretch of
land and sea as wide as from New York to San Francisco, and deeper than
from the northern lakes to the Gulf of Mexico; and every man and woman,
of high degree or low, who can afford the expense, put away their other
duties and come. They begin to swarm in by ship and rail a fortnight
before the day, and they swarm thicker and thicker day after day, until
all the vehicles of transportation are taxed to their uttermost to meet
the demands of the occasion, and all hotels and lodgings are bulging
outward because of the pressure from within. They come a hundred
thousand strong, as all the best authorities say, and they pack the
spacious grounds and grandstands and make a spectacle such as is never
to be seen in Australasia elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is the “Melbourne Cup“ that brings this multitude together. Their
clothes have been ordered long ago, at unlimited cost, and without
bounds as to beauty and magnificence, and have been kept in concealment
until now, for unto this day are they consecrate. I am speaking of the
ladies’ clothes; but one might know that.</p>
<p>And so the grand-stands make a brilliant and wonderful spectacle, a
delirium of color, a vision of beauty. The champagne flows, everybody is
vivacious, excited, happy; everybody bets, and gloves and fortunes
change hands right along, all the time. Day after day the races go on,
and the fun and the excitement are kept at white heat; and when each day
is done, the people dance all night so as to be fresh for the race in
the morning. And at the end of the great week the swarms secure lodgings
and transportation for next year, then flock away to their remote homes
and count their gains and losses, and order next year’s Cup-clothes, and
then lie down and sleep two weeks, and get up sorry to reflect that a
whole year must be put in somehow or other before they can be wholly
happy again.</p>
<p>The Melbourne Cup is the Australasian National Day. It would be
difficult to overstate its importance. It overshadows all other holidays
and specialized days of whatever sort in that congeries of colonies.
Overshadows them? I might almost say it blots them out. Each of them
gets attention, but not everybody’s; each of them evokes interest, but
not everybody’s; each of them rouses enthusiasm, but not everybody’s; in
each case a part of the attention, interest, and enthusiasm is a matter
of habit and custom, and another part of it is official and perfunctory.
Cup Day, and Cup Day only, commands an attention, an interest, and an
enthusiasm which are universal–and spontaneous, not perfunctory. Cup Day
is supreme it has no rival. I can call to mind no specialized annual
day, in any country, which can be named by that large name–Supreme. I
can call to mind no specialized annual day, in any country, whose
approach fires the whole land with a conflagration of conversation and
preparation and anticipation and jubilation. No day save this one; but
this one does it.</p>
<p>In America we have no annual supreme day; no day whose approach makes
the whole nation glad. We have the Fourth of July, and Christmas, and
Thanksgiving. Neither of them can claim the primacy; neither of them can
arouse an enthusiasm which comes near to being universal. Eight grown
Americans out of ten dread the coming of the Fourth, with its
pandemonium and its perils, and they rejoice when it is gone–if still
alive. The approach of Christmas brings harassment and dread to many
excellent people. They have to buy a cart-load of presents, and they
never know what to buy to hit the various tastes; they put in three
weeks of hard and anxious work, and when Christmas morning comes they
are so dissatisfied with the result, and so disappointed that they want
to sit down and cry. Then they give thanks that Christmas comes but once
a year. The observance of Thanksgiving Day–as a function–has become
general of late years. The Thankfulness is not so general. This is
natural. Two-thirds of the nation have always had hard luck and a hard
time during the year, and this has a calming effect upon their
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>We have a supreme day–a sweeping and tremendous and tumultuous day, a
day which commands an absolute universality of interest and excitement;
but it is not annual. It comes but once in four years; therefore it
cannot count as a rival of the Melbourne Cup.</p>
<p>In Great Britain and Ireland they have two great days–Christmas and
the Queen’s birthday. But they are equally popular; there is no
supremacy.</p>
<p>I think it must be conceded that the position of the Australasian Day
is unique, solitary, unfellowed; and likely to hold that high place a
long time.</p>
<p>The next things which interest us when we travel are, first, the
people; next, the novelties; and finally the history of the places and
countries visited. Novelties are rare in cities which represent the most
advanced civilization of the modern day. When one is familiar with such
cities in the other parts of the world he is in effect familiar with the
cities of Australasia. The outside aspects will furnish little that is
new. There will be new names, but the things which they represent will
sometimes be found to be less new than their names. There may be shades
of difference, but these can easily be too fine for detection by the
incompetent eye of the passing stranger. In the larrikin he will not be
able to discover a new species, but only an old one met elsewhere, and
variously called loafer, rough, tough, bummer, or blatherskite,
according to his geographical distribution. The larrikin differs by a
shade from those others, in that he is more sociable toward the stranger
than they, more kindly disposed, more hospitable, more hearty, more
friendly. At least it seemed so to me, and I had opportunity to observe.
In Sydney, at least. In Melbourne I had to drive to and from the
lecture-theater, but in Sydney I was able to walk both ways, and did it.
Every night, on my way home at ten, or a quarter past, I found the
larrikin grouped in considerable force at several of the street corners,
and he always gave me this pleasant salutation:</p>
<p>“Hello, Mark!“</p>
<p>“Here’s to you, old chap!</p>
<p>“Say–Mark!–is he dead?“–a reference to a passage in some book of
mine, though I did not detect, at that time, that that was its source.
And I didn’t detect it afterward in Melbourne, when I came on the stage
for the first time, and the same question was dropped down upon me from
the dizzy height of the gallery. It is always difficult to answer a
sudden inquiry like that, when you have come unprepared and don’t know
what it means. I will remark here–if it is not an indecorum–that the
welcome which an American lecturer gets from a British colonial audience
is a thing which will move him to his deepest deeps, and veil his sight
and break his voice. And from Winnipeg to Africa, experience will teach
him nothing; he will never learn to expect it, it will catch him as a
surprise each time. The war-cloud hanging black over England and America
made no trouble for me. I was a prospective prisoner of war, but at
dinners, suppers, on the platform, and elsewhere, there was never
anything to remind me of it. This was hospitality of the right metal,
and would have been prominently lacking in some countries, in the
circumstances.</p>
<p>And speaking of the war-flurry, it seemed to me to bring to light the
unexpected, in a detail or two. It seemed to relegate the war-talk to
the politicians on both sides of the water; whereas whenever a
prospective war between two nations had been in the air theretofore, the
public had done most of the talking and the bitterest. The attitude of
the newspapers was new also. I speak of those of Australasia and India,
for I had access to those only. They treated the subject argumentatively
and with dignity, not with spite and anger. That was a new spirit, too,
and not learned of the French and German press, either before Sedan or
since. I heard many public speeches, and they reflected the moderation
of the journals. The outlook is that the English-speaking race will
dominate the earth a hundred years from now, if its sections do not get
to fighting each other. It would be a pity to spoil that prospect by
baffling and retarding wars when arbitration would settle their
differences so much better and also so much more definitely.</p>
<p>No, as I have suggested, novelties are rare in the great capitals of
modern times. Even the wool exchange in Melbourne could not be told from
the familiar stock exchange of other countries. Wool brokers are just
like stockbrokers; they all bounce from their seats and put up their
hands and yell in unison–no stranger can tell what–and the president
calmly says “Sold to Smith andandandand Co., threpence
farthing–next!“–when probably nothing of the kind happened; for how
should he know?</p>
<p>In the museums you will find acres of the most strange and
fascinating things; but all museums are fascinating, and they do so tire
your eyes, and break your back, and burn out your vitalities with their
consuming interest. You always say you will never go again, but you do
go. The palaces of the rich, in Melbourne, are much like the palaces of
the rich in America, and the life in them is the same; but there the
resemblance ends. The grounds surrounding the American palace are not
often large, and not often beautiful, but in the Melbourne case the
grounds are often ducally spacious, and the climate and the gardeners
together make them as beautiful as a dream. It is said that some of the
country seats have grounds–domains–about them which rival in charm and
magnitude those which surround the country mansion of an English lord;
but I was not out in the country; I had my hands full in town.</p>
<p>And what was the origin of this majestic city and its efflorescence
of palatial town houses and country seats? Its first brick was laid and
its first house built by a passing convict. Australian history is almost
always picturesque; indeed, it is so curious and strange, that it is
itself the chiefest novelty the country has to offer, and so it pushes
the other novelties into second and third place. It does not read like
history, but like the most beautiful lies. And all of a fresh new sort,
no mouldy old stale ones. It is full of surprises, and adventures, and
incongruities, and contradictions, and incredibilities; but they are all
true, they all happened.</p>
