<h4 id="chapter-lxviii.">CHAPTER LXVIII.</h4>
<p>None of us can have as many virtues as the fountain-pen, or half its
cussedness; but we can try. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>The Duke of Fife has borne testimony that Mr. Rhodes deceived him.
That is also what Mr. Rhodes did with the Reformers. He got them into
trouble, and then stayed out himself. A judicious man. He has always
been that. As to this there was a moment of doubt, once. It was when he
was out on his last pirating expedition in the Matabele country. The
cable shouted out that he had gone unarmed, to visit a party of hostile
chiefs. It was true, too; and this dare-devil thing came near fetching
another indiscretion out of the poet laureate. It would have been too
bad, for when the facts were all in, it turned out that there was a lady
along, too, and she also was unarmed.</p>
<p>In the opinion of many people Mr. Rhodes is South Africa; others
think he is only a large part of it. These latter consider that South
Africa consists of Table Mountain, the diamond mines, the Johannesburg
gold fields, and Cecil Rhodes. The gold fields are wonderful in every
way. In seven or eight years they built up, in a desert, a city of a
hundred thousand inhabitants, counting white and black together; and not
the ordinary mining city of wooden shanties, but a city made out of
lasting material. Nowhere in the world is there such a concentration of
rich mines as at Johannesburg. Mr. Bonamici, my manager there, gave me a
small gold brick with some statistics engraved upon it which record the
output of gold from the early days to July, 1895, and exhibit the
strides which have been made in the development of the industry; in 1888
the output was ,162,440; the output of the next five and a half years
was (total: 7,585,894); for the single year ending with June, 1895, it
was 5,553,700.</p>
<p>The capital which has developed the mines came from England, the
mining engineers from America. This is the case with the diamond mines
also. South Africa seems to be the heaven of the American scientific
mining engineer. He gets the choicest places, and keeps them. His salary
is not based upon what he would get in America, but apparently upon what
a whole family of him would get there.</p>
<p>The successful mines pay great dividends, yet the rock is not rich,
from a Californian point of view. Rock which yields ten or twelve
dollars a ton is considered plenty rich enough. It is troubled with base
metals to such a degree that twenty years ago it would have been only
about half as valuable as it is now; for at that time there was no
paying way of getting anything out of such rock but the coarser-grained
“free“ gold; but the new cyanide process has changed all that, and the
gold fields of the world now deliver up fifty million dollars’ worth of
gold per year which would have gone into the tailing-pile under the
former conditions.</p>
<p>The cyanide process was new to me, and full of interest; and among
the costly and elaborate mining machinery there were fine things which
were new to me, but I was already familiar with the rest of the details
of the gold-mining industry. I had been a gold miner myself, in my day,
and knew substantially everything that those people knew about it,
except how to make money at it. But I learned a good deal about the
Boers there, and that was a fresh subject. What I heard there was
afterwards repeated to me in other parts of South Africa. Summed
up–according to the information thus gained–this is the Boer:</p>
<p>He is deeply religious, profoundly ignorant, dull, obstinate,
bigoted, uncleanly in his habits, hospitable, honest in his dealings
with the whites, a hard master to his black servant, lazy, a good shot,
good horseman, addicted to the chase, a lover of political independence,
a good husband and father, not fond of herding together in towns, but
liking the seclusion and remoteness and solitude and empty vastness and
silence of the veldt; a man of a mighty appetite, and not delicate about
what he appeases it with–well-satisfied with pork and Indian corn and
biltong, requiring only that the quantity shall not be stinted; willing
to ride a long journey to take a hand in a rude all-night dance
interspersed with vigorous feeding and boisterous jollity, but ready to
ride twice as far for a prayer-meeting; proud of his Dutch and Huguenot
origin and its religious and military history; proud of his race’s
achievements in South Africa, its bold plunges into hostile and
uncharted deserts in search of free solitudes unvexed by the pestering
and detested English, also its victories over the natives and the
British; proudest of all, of the direct and effusive personal interest
which the Deity has always taken in its affairs. He cannot read, he
cannot write; he has one or two newspapers, but he is, apparently, not
aware of it; until latterly he had no schools, and taught his children
nothing, news is a term which has no meaning to him, and the thing
itself he cares nothing about. He hates to be taxed and resents it. He
has stood stock still in South Africa for two centuries and a half, and
would like to stand still till the end of time, for he has no sympathy
with Uitlander notions of progress. He is hungry to be rich, for he is
human; but his preference has been for riches in cattle, not in fine
clothes and fine houses and gold and diamonds. The gold and the diamonds
have brought the godless stranger within his gates, also contamination
and broken repose, and he wishes that they had never been
discovered.</p>
<p>I think that the bulk of those details can be found in Olive
Schreiner’s books, and she would not be accused of sketching the Boer’s
portrait with an unfair hand.</p>
<p>Now what would you expect from that unpromising material? What ought
you to expect from it? Laws inimical to religious liberty? Yes. Laws
denying, representation and suffrage to the intruder? Yes. Laws
unfriendly to educational institutions? Yes. Laws obstructive of gold
production? Yes. Discouragement of railway expansion? Yes. Laws heavily
taxing the intruder and overlooking the Boer? Yes.</p>
<p>The Uitlander seems to have expected something very different from
all that. I do not know why. Nothing different from it was rationally to
be expected. A round man cannot be expected to fit a square hole right
away. He must have time to modify his shape. The modification had begun
in a detail or two, before the Raid, and was making some progress. It
has made further progress since. There are wise men in the Boer
government, and that accounts for the modification; the modification of
the Boer mass has probably not begun yet. If the heads of the Boer
government had not been wise men they would have hanged Jameson, and
thus turned a very commonplace pirate into a holy martyr. But even their
wisdom has its limits, and they will hang Mr. Rhodes if they ever catch
him. That will round him and complete him and make him a saint. He has
already been called by all other titles that symbolize human grandeur,
and he ought to rise to this one, the grandest of all. It will be a
dizzy jump from where he is now, but that is nothing, it will land him
in good company and be a pleasant change for him.</p>
<p>Some of the things demanded by the Johannesburgers’ Manifesto have
been conceded since the days of the Raid, and the others will follow in
time, no doubt. It was most fortunate for the miners of Johannesburg
that the taxes which distressed them so much were levied by the Boer
government, instead of by their friend Rhodes and his Chartered Company
of highwaymen, for these latter take half of whatever their mining
victims find, they do not stop at a mere percentage. If the Johannesburg
miners were under their jurisdiction they would be in the poorhouse in
twelve months.</p>
<p>I have been under the impression all along that I had an unpleasant
paragraph about the Boers somewhere in my notebook, and also a pleasant
one. I have found them now. The unpleasant one is dated at an interior
village, and says–</p>
<p>“Mr. Z. called. He is an English Afrikander; is an old resident, and
has a Boer wife. He speaks the language, and his professional business
is with the Boers exclusively. He told me that the ancient Boer families
in the great region of which this village is the commercial center are
falling victims to their inherited indolence and dullness in the
materialistic latter-day race and struggle, and are dropping one by one
into the grip of the usurer–getting hopelessly in debt–and are losing
their high place and retiring to second and lower. The Boer’s farm does
not go to another Boer when he loses it, but to a foreigner. Some have
fallen so low that they sell their daughters to the blacks.“</p>
<p>Under date of another South African town I find the note which is
creditable to the Boers:</p>
<p>“Dr. X. told me that in the Kafir war 1,500 Kafirs took refuge in a
great cave in the mountains about 90 miles north of Johannesburg, and
the Boers blocked up the entrance and smoked them to death. Dr. X. has
been in there and seen the great array of bleached skeletons–one a woman
with the skeleton of a child hugged to her breast.“</p>
<p>The great bulk of the savages must go. The white man wants their
lands, and all must go excepting such percentage of them as he will need
to do his work for him upon terms to be determined by himself. Since
history has removed the element of guesswork from this matter and made
it certainty, the humanest way of diminishing the black population
should be adopted, not the old cruel ways of the past. Mr. Rhodes and
his gang have been following the old ways.–They are chartered to rob and
slay, and they lawfully do it, but not in a compassionate and Christian
spirit. They rob the Mashonas and the Matabeles of a portion of their
territories in the hallowed old style of “purchase!“ for a song, and
then they force a quarrel and take the rest by the strong hand. They rob
the natives of their cattle under the pretext that all the cattle in the
country belonged to the king whom they have tricked and assassinated.
They issue “regulations“ requiring the incensed and harassed natives to
work for the white settlers, and neglect their own affairs to do it.
This is slavery, and is several times worse than was the American
slavery which used to pain England so much; for when this Rhodesian
slave is sick, super-annuated, or otherwise disabled, he must support
himself or starve–his master is under no obligation to support him.</p>
<p>The reduction of the population by Rhodesian methods to the desired
limit is a return to the old-time slow-misery and lingering-death system
of a discredited time and a crude “civilization.“ We humanely reduce an
overplus of dogs by swift chloroform; the Boer humanely reduced an
overplus of blacks by swift suffocation; the nameless but right-hearted
Australian pioneer humanely reduced his overplus of aboriginal neighbors
by a sweetened swift death concealed in a poisoned pudding. All these
are admirable, and worthy of praise; you and I would rather suffer
either of these deaths thirty times over in thirty successive days than
linger out one of the Rhodesian twenty-year deaths, with its daily
burden of insult, humiliation, and forced labor for a man whose entire
race the victim hates. Rhodesia is a happy name for that land of piracy
and pillage, and puts the right stain upon it.</p>
<p>Several long journeys–gave us experience of the Cape Colony railways;
easy-riding, fine cars; all the conveniences; thorough cleanliness;
comfortable beds furnished for the night trains. It was in the first
days of June, and winter; the daytime was pleasant, the nighttime nice
and cold. Spinning along all day in the cars it was ecstasy to breathe
the bracing air and gaze out over the vast brown solitudes of the velvet
plains, soft and lovely near by, still softer and lovelier further away,
softest and loveliest of all in the remote distances, where dim
island-hills seemed afloat, as in a sea–a sea made of dream-stuff and
flushed with colors faint and rich; and dear me, the depth of the sky,
and the beauty of the strange new cloud-forms, and the glory of the
sunshine, the lavishness, the wastefulness of it! The vigor and
freshness and inspiration of the air and the sunwell, it was all just as
Olive Schreiner had made it in her books.</p>
<p>To me the veldt, in its sober winter garb, was surpassingly
beautiful. There were unlevel stretches where it was rolling and
swelling, and rising and subsiding, and sweeping superbly on and on, and
still on and on like an ocean, toward the faraway horizon, its pale
brown deepening by delicately graduated shades to rich orange, and
finally to purple and crimson where it washed against the wooded hills
and naked red crags at the base of the sky.</p>
<p>Everywhere, from Cape Town to Kimberley and from Kimberley to Port
Elizabeth and East London, the towns were well populated with tamed
blacks; tamed and Christianized too, I suppose, for they wore the dowdy
clothes of our Christian civilization. But for that, many of them would
have been remarkably handsome. These fiendish clothes, together with the
proper lounging gait, good-natured face, happy air, and easy laugh, made
them precise counterparts of our American blacks; often where all the
other aspects were strikingly and harmoniously and thrillingly African,
a flock of these natives would intrude, looking wholly out of place, and
spoil it all, making the thing a grating discord, half African and half
American.</p>
<p>One Sunday in King William’s Town a score of colored women came
mincing across the great barren square dressed–oh, in the last
perfection of fashion, and newness, and expensiveness, and showy mixture
of unrelated colors,–all just as I had seen it so often at home; and in
their faces and their gait was that languishing, aristocratic, divine
delight in their finery which was so familiar to me, and had always been
such a satisfaction to my eye and my heart. I seemed among old, old
friends; friends of fifty years, and I stopped and cordially greeted
them. They broke into a good-fellowship laugh, flashing their white
teeth upon me, and all answered at once. I did not understand a word
they said. I was astonished; I was not dreaming that they would answer
in anything but American.</p>
<p>The voices, too, of the African women, were familiar to me sweet and
musical, just like those of the slave women of my early days. I followed
a couple of them all over the Orange Free State–no, over its capital
–Bloemfontein, to hear their liquid voices and the happy ripple of their
laughter. Their language was a large improvement upon American. Also
upon the Zulu. It had no Zulu clicks in it; and it seemed to have no
angles or corners, no roughness, no vile s’s or other hissing sounds,
but was very, very mellow and rounded and flowing.</p>
<p>In moving about the country in the trains, I had opportunity to see a
good many Boers of the veldt. One day at a village station a hundred of
them got out of the third-class cars to feed.</p>
<p>Their clothes were very interesting. For ugliness of shapes, and for
miracles of ugly colors inharmoniously associated, they were a record.
The effect was nearly as exciting and interesting as that produced by
the brilliant and beautiful clothes and perfect taste always on view at
the Indian railway stations. One man had corduroy trousers of a faded
chewing gum tint. And they were new–showing that this tint did not come
by calamity, but was intentional; the very ugliest color I have ever
seen. A gaunt, shackly country lout six feet high, in battered gray
slouched hat with wide brim, and old resin-colored breeches, had on a
hideous brand-new woolen coat which was imitation tiger skin wavy broad
stripes of dazzling yellow and deep brown. I thought he ought to be
hanged, and asked the station-master if it could be arranged. He said
no; and not only that, but said it rudely; said it with a quite
unnecessary show of feeling. Then he muttered something about my being a
jackass, and walked away and pointed me out to people, and did
everything he could to turn public sentiment against me. It is what one
gets for trying to do good.</p>
<p>In the train that day a passenger told me some more about Boer life
out in the lonely veldt. He said the Boer gets up early and sets his
“niggers“ at their tasks (pasturing the cattle, and watching them);
eats, smokes, drowses, sleeps; toward evening superintends the milking,
etc.; eats, smokes, drowses; goes to bed at early candlelight in the
fragrant clothes he (and she) have worn all day and every week-day for
years. I remember that last detail, in Olive Schreiner’s “Story of an
African Farm.“ And the passenger told me that the Boers were justly
noted for their hospitality. He told me a story about it. He said that
his grace the Bishop of a certain See was once making a
business-progress through the tavernless veldt, and one night he stopped
with a Boer; after supper was shown to bed; he undressed, weary and worn
out, and was soon sound asleep; in the night he woke up feeling crowded
and suffocated, and found the old Boer and his fat wife in bed with him,
one on each side, with all their clothes on, and snoring. He had to stay
there and stand it–awake and suffering–until toward dawn, when sleep
again fell upon him for an hour. Then he woke again. The Boer was gone,
but the wife was still at his side.</p>
<p>Those Reformers detested that Boer prison; they were not used to
cramped quarters and tedious hours, and weary idleness, and early to
bed, and limited movement, and arbitrary and irritating rules, and the
absence of the luxuries which wealth comforts the day and the night
with. The confinement told upon their bodies and their spirits; still,
they were superior men, and they made the best that was to be made of
the circumstances. Their wives smuggled delicacies to them, which helped
to smooth the way down for the prison fare.</p>
<p>In the train Mr. B. told me that the Boer jail-guards treated the
black prisoners–even political ones–mercilessly. An African chief and
his following had been kept there nine months without trial, and during
all that time they had been without shelter from rain and sun. He said
that one day the guards put a big black in the stocks for dashing his
soup on the ground; they stretched his legs painfully wide apart, and
set him with his back down hill; he could not endure it, and put back
his hands upon the slope for a support. The guard ordered him to
withdraw the support and kicked him in the back. “Then,“ said Mr. B.,
“’the powerful black wrenched the stocks asunder and went for the guard;
a Reform prisoner pulled him off, and thrashed the guard himself.“</p>
