<h4 id="chapter-iv-student-life-the-laborious-beer-king">Chapter IV
Student Life [The Laborious Beer King]</h4>
<p>The summer semester was in full tide; consequently the most frequent
figure in and about Heidelberg was the student. Most of the students
were Germans, of course, but the representatives of foreign lands were
very numerous. They hailed from every corner of the globe–for
instruction is cheap in Heidelberg, and so is living, too. The
Anglo-American Club, composed of British and American students, had
twenty-five members, and there was still much material left to draw
from.</p>
<p>Nine-tenths of the Heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform; the
other tenth wore caps of various colors, and belonged to social
organizations called “corps.“ There were five corps, each with a color
of its own; there were white caps, blue caps, and red, yellow, and green
ones. The famous duel-fighting is confined to the “corps“ boys. The
“KNEIP“ seems to be a specialty of theirs, too. Kneips are held, now and
then, to celebrate great occasions, like the election of a beer king,
for instance. The solemnity is simple; the five corps assemble at night,
and at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer, out of
pint-mugs, as fast as possible, and each man keeps his own count–usually
by laying aside a lucifer match for each mud he empties. The election is
soon decided. When the candidates can hold no more, a count is
instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of pints is
proclaimed king. I was told that the last beer king elected by the
corps–or by his own capabilities–emptied his mug seventy-five times. No
stomach could hold all that quantity at one time, of course–but there
are ways of frequently creating a vacuum, which those who have been much
at sea will understand.</p>
<p>One sees so many students abroad at all hours, that he presently
begins to wonder if they ever have any working-hours. Some of them have,
some of them haven’t. Each can choose for himself whether he will work
or play; for German university life is a very free life; it seems to
have no restraints. The student does not live in the college buildings,
but hires his own lodgings, in any locality he prefers, and he takes his
meals when and where he pleases. He goes to bed when it suits him, and
does not get up at all unless he wants to. He is not entered at the
university for any particular length of time; so he is likely to change
about. He passes no examinations upon entering college. He merely pays a
trifling fee of five or ten dollars, receives a card entitling him to
the privileges of the university, and that is the end of it. He is now
ready for business–or play, as he shall prefer. If he elects to work, he
finds a large list of lectures to choose from. He selects the subjects
which he will study, and enters his name for these studies; but he can
skip attendance.</p>
<p>The result of this system is, that lecture-courses upon specialties
of an unusual nature are often delivered to very slim audiences, while
those upon more practical and every-day matters of education are
delivered to very large ones. I heard of one case where, day after day,
the lecturer’s audience consisted of three students–and always the same
three. But one day two of them remained away. The lecturer began as
usual–</p>
<p>“Gentlemen,“ –then, without a smile, he corrected himself,
saying–</p>
<p>“Sir,“ –and went on with his discourse.</p>
<p>It is said that the vast majority of the Heidelberg students are hard
workers, and make the most of their opportunities; that they have no
surplus means to spend in dissipation, and no time to spare for
frolicking. One lecture follows right on the heels of another, with very
little time for the student to get out of one hall and into the next;
but the industrious ones manage it by going on a trot. The professors
assist them in the saving of their time by being promptly in their
little boxed-up pulpits when the hours strike, and as promptly out again
when the hour finishes. I entered an empty lecture-room one day just
before the clock struck. The place had simple, unpainted pine desks and
benches for about two hundred persons.</p>
<p>About a minute before the clock struck, a hundred and fifty students
swarmed in, rushed to their seats, immediately spread open their
notebooks and dipped their pens in ink. When the clock began to strike,
a burly professor entered, was received with a round of applause, moved
swiftly down the center aisle, said “Gentlemen,“ and began to talk as he
climbed his pulpit steps; and by the time he had arrived in his box and
faced his audience, his lecture was well under way and all the pens were
going. He had no notes, he talked with prodigious rapidity and energy
for an hour–then the students began to remind him in certain
well-understood ways that his time was up; he seized his hat, still
talking, proceeded swiftly down his pulpit steps, got out the last word
of his discourse as he struck the floor; everybody rose respectfully,
and he swept rapidly down the aisle and disappeared. An instant rush for
some other lecture-room followed, and in a minute I was alone with the
empty benches once more.</p>
<p>Yes, without doubt, idle students are not the rule. Out of eight
hundred in the town, I knew the faces of only about fifty; but these I
saw everywhere, and daily. They walked about the streets and the wooded
hills, they drove in cabs, they boated on the river, they sipped beer
and coffee, afternoons, in the Schloss gardens. A good many of them wore
colored caps of the corps. They were finely and fashionably dressed,
their manners were quite superb, and they led an easy, careless,
comfortable life. If a dozen of them sat together and a lady or a
gentleman passed whom one of them knew and saluted, they all rose to
their feet and took off their caps. The members of a corps always
received a fellow-member in this way, too; but they paid no attention to
members of other corps; they did not seem to see them. This was not a
discourtesy; it was only a part of the elaborate and rigid corps
etiquette.</p>
<p>There seems to be no chilly distance existing between the German
students and the professor; but, on the contrary, a companionable
intercourse, the opposite of chilliness and reserve. When the professor
enters a beer-hall in the evening where students are gathered together,
these rise up and take off their caps, and invite the old gentleman to
sit with them and partake. He accepts, and the pleasant talk and the
beer flow for an hour or two, and by and by the professor, properly
charged and comfortable, gives a cordial good night, while the students
stand bowing and uncovered; and then he moves on his happy way homeward
with all his vast cargo of learning afloat in his hold. Nobody finds
fault or feels outraged; no harm has been done.</p>
<p>It seemed to be a part of corps etiquette to keep a dog or so, too. I
mean a corps dog–the common property of the organization, like the corps
steward or head servant; then there are other dogs, owned by
individuals.</p>
<p>On a summer afternoon in the Castle gardens, I have seen six students
march solemnly into the grounds, in single file, each carrying a bright
Chinese parasol and leading a prodigious dog by a string. It was a very
imposing spectacle. Sometimes there would be as many dogs around the
pavilion as students; and of all breeds and of all degrees of beauty and
ugliness. These dogs had a rather dry time of it; for they were tied to
the benches and had no amusement for an hour or two at a time except
what they could get out of pawing at the gnats, or trying to sleep and
not succeeding. However, they got a lump of sugar occasionally–they were
fond of that.</p>
<p>It seemed right and proper that students should indulge in dogs; but
everybody else had them, too–old men and young ones, old women and nice
young ladies. If there is one spectacle that is unpleasanter than
another, it is that of an elegantly dressed young lady towing a dog by a
string. It is said to be the sign and symbol of blighted love. It seems
to me that some other way of advertising it might be devised, which
would be just as conspicuous and yet not so trying to the
proprieties.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to suppose that the easy-going pleasure-seeking
student carries an empty head. Just the contrary. He has spent nine
years in the gymnasium, under a system which allowed him no freedom, but
vigorously compelled him to work like a slave. Consequently, he has left
the gymnasium with an education which is so extensive and complete, that
the most a university can do for it is to perfect some of its profounder
specialties. It is said that when a pupil leaves the gymnasium, he not
only has a comprehensive education, but he KNOWS what he knows–it is not
befogged with uncertainty, it is burnt into him so that it will stay.
For instance, he does not merely read and write Greek, but speaks it;
the same with the Latin. Foreign youth steer clear of the gymnasium; its
rules are too severe. They go to the university to put a mansard roof on
their whole general education; but the German student already has his
mansard roof, so he goes there to add a steeple in the nature of some
specialty, such as a particular branch of law, or diseases of the eye,
or special study of the ancient Gothic tongues. So this German attends
only the lectures which belong to the chosen branch, and drinks his beer
and tows his dog around and has a general good time the rest of the day.
He has been in rigid bondage so long that the large liberty of the
university life is just what he needs and likes and thoroughly
appreciates; and as it cannot last forever, he makes the most of it
while it does last, and so lays up a good rest against the day that must
see him put on the chains once more and enter the slavery of official or
professional life.</p>
