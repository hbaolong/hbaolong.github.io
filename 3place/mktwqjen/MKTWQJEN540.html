<h4 id="chapter-xiv.">CHAPTER XIV.</h4>
<p>So Tracy went home to supper. The odors in that supper room seemed
more strenuous and more horrible than ever before, and he was happy in
the thought that he was so soon to be free from them again. When the
supper was over he hardly knew whether he had eaten any of it or not,
and he certainly hadn’t heard any of the conversation. His heart had
been dancing all the time, his thoughts had been faraway from these
things, and in the visions of his mind the sumptuous appointments of his
father’s castle had risen before him without rebuke. Even the plushed
flunkey, that walking symbol of a sham inequality, had not been
unpleasant to his dreaming view. After the meal Barrow said,</p>
<p>“Come with me. I’ll give you a jolly evening.“</p>
<p>“Very good. Where are you going?“</p>
<p>“To my club.“</p>
<p>“What club is that?“</p>
<p>“Mechanics’ Debating Club.“</p>
<p>Tracy shuddered, slightly. He didn’t say anything about having
visited that place himself. Somehow he didn’t quite relish the memory of
that time. The sentiments which had made his former visit there so
enjoyable, and filled him with such enthusiasm, had undergone a gradual
change, and they had rotted away to such a degree that he couldn’t
contemplate another visit there with anything strongly resembling
delight. In fact he was a little ashamed to go; he didn’t want to go
there and find out by the rude impact of the thought of those people
upon his reorganized condition of mind, how sharp the change had been.
He would have preferred to stay away. He expected that now he should
hear nothing except sentiments which would be a reproach to him in his
changed mental attitude, and he rather wished he might be excused. And
yet he didn’t quite want to say that, he didn’t want to show how he did
feel, or show any disinclination to go, and so he forced himself to go
along with Barrow, privately purposing to take an early opportunity to
get away.</p>
<p>After the essayist of the evening had read his paper, the chairman
announced that the debate would now be upon the subject of the previous
meeting, “The American Press.“ It saddened the backsliding disciple to
hear this announcement. It brought up too many reminiscences. He wished
he had happened upon some other subject. But the debate began, and he
sat still and listened.</p>
<p>In the course of the discussion one of the speakers–a blacksmith
named Tompkins–arraigned all monarchs and all lords in the earth for
their cold selfishness in retaining their unearned dignities. He said
that no monarch and no son of a monarch, no lord and no son of a lord
ought to be able to look his fellow man in the face without shame. Shame
for consenting to keep his unearned titles, property, and privileges–at
the expense of other people; shame for consenting to remain, on any
terms, in dishonourable possession of these things, which represented
bygone robberies and wrongs inflicted upon the general people of the
nation. He said, “if there were a laid or the son of a lord here, I
would like to reason with him, and try to show him how unfair and how
selfish his position is. I would try to persuade him to relinquish it,
take his place among men on equal terms, earn the bread he eats, and
hold of slight value all deference paid him because of artificial
position, all reverence not the just due of his own personal
merits.“</p>
<p>Tracy seemed to be listening to utterances of his own made in talks
with his radical friends in England. It was as if some eavesdropping
phonograph had treasured up his words and brought them across the
Atlantic to accuse him with them in the hour of his defection and
retreat. Every word spoken by this stranger seemed to leave a blister on
Tracy’s conscience, and by the time the speech was finished he felt that
he was all conscience and one blister. This man’s deep compassion for
the enslaved and oppressed millions in Europe who had to bear with the
contempt of that small class above them, throned upon shining heights
whose paths were shut against them, was the very thing he had often
uttered himself. The pity in this man’s voice and words was the very
twin of the pity that used to reside in his own heart and come from his
own lips when he thought of these oppressed peoples.</p>
<p>The homeward tramp was accomplished in brooding silence. It was a
silence most grateful to Tracy’s feelings. He wouldn’t have broken it
for anything; for he was ashamed of himself all the way through to his
spine. He kept saying to himself:</p>
<p>“How unanswerable it all is–how absolutely unanswerable! It is
basely, degradingly selfish to keep those unearned honors, and–and–oh,
hang it, nobody but a cur–“</p>
<p>“What an idiotic damned speech that Tompkins made!“</p>
<p>This outburst was from Barrow. It flooded Tracy’s demoralized soul
with waters of refreshment. These were the darlingest words the poor
vacillating young apostate had ever heard–for they whitewashed his shame
for him, and that is a good service to have when you can’t get the best
of all verdicts, self-acquittal.</p>
<p>“Come up to my room and smoke a pipe, Tracy.“</p>
<p>Tracy had been expecting this invitation, and had had his declination
all ready: but he was glad enough to accept, now. Was it possible that a
reasonable argument could be made against that man’s desolating speech?
He was burning to hear Barrow try it. He knew how to start him, and keep
him going: it was to seem to combat his positions–a process effective
with most people.</p>
<p>“What is it you object to in Tompkins’s speech, Barrow?“</p>
<p>“Oh, the leaving out of the factor of human nature; requiring another
man to do what you wouldn’t do yourself.“</p>
<p>“Do you mean–“</p>
<p>“Why here’s what I mean; it’s very simple. Tompkins is a blacksmith;
has a family; works for wages; and hard, too–fooling around won’t
furnish the bread. Suppose it should turn out that by the death of
somebody in England he is suddenly an earl–income, half a million
dollars a year. What would he do?“</p>
<p>“Well, I–I suppose he would have to decline to–“</p>
<p>“Man, he would grab it in a second!“</p>
<p>“Do you really think he would?“</p>
<p>“Think?–I don’t think anything about it, I know it.“</p>
<p>“Why?“</p>
<p>“Because he’s not a fool.“</p>
<p>“So you think that if he were a fool, he–“</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. Fool or no fool, he would grab it. Anybody would.
Anybody that’s alive. And I’ve seen dead people that would get up and go
for it. I would myself.“</p>
<p>“This was balm, this was healing, this was rest and peace and
comfort.“</p>
<p>“But I thought you were opposed to nobilities.“</p>
<p>“Transmissible ones, yes. But that’s nothing. I’m opposed to
millionaires, but it would be dangerous to offer me the position.“</p>
<p>“You’d take it?“</p>
<p>“I would leave the funeral of my dearest enemy to go and assume its
burdens and responsibilities.“</p>
<p>Tracy thought a while, then said:</p>
<p>“I don’t know that I quite get the bearings of your position. You say
you are opposed to hereditary nobilities, and yet if you had the chance
you would–“</p>
<p>“Take one? In a minute I would. And there isn’t a mechanic in that
entire club that wouldn’t. There isn’t a lawyer, doctor, editor, author,
tinker, loafer, railroad president, saint-land, there isn’t a human
being in the United States that wouldn’t jump at the chance!“</p>
<p>“Except me,“ said Tracy softly.</p>
<p>“Except you!“ Barrow could hardly get the words out, his scorn so
choked him. And he couldn’t get any further than that form of words; it
seemed to dam his flow, utterly. He got up and came and glared upon
Tracy in a kind of outraged and unappeasable way, and said again,
“Except you!“ He walked around him–inspecting him from one point of view
and then another, and relieving his soul now and then by exploding that
formula at him; “Except you!“ Finally he slumped down into his chair
with the air of one who gives it up, and said:</p>
<p>“He’s straining his viscera and he’s breaking his heart trying to get
some low-down job that a good dog wouldn’t have, and yet wants to let on
that if he had a chance to scoop an earldom he wouldn’t do it. Tracy,
don’t put this kind of a strain on me. Lately I’m not as strong as I
was.“</p>
<p>“Well, I wasn’t meaning to put–a strain on you, Barrow, I was only
meaning to intimate that if an earldom ever does fall in my way–“</p>
<p>“There–I wouldn’t give myself any worry about that, if I was you. And
besides, I can settle what you would do. Are you any different from
me?“</p>
<p>“Well–no.“</p>
<p>“Are you any better than me?“</p>
<p>“O,–er–why, certainly not.“</p>
<p>“Are you as good? Come!“</p>
<p>“Indeed, I–the fact is you take me so suddenly–“</p>
<p>“Suddenly? What is there sudden about it? It isn’t a difficult
question is it? Or doubtful? Just measure us on the only fair lines–the
lines of merit–and of course you’ll admit that a journeyman chairmaker
that earns his twenty dollars a week, and has had the good and genuine
culture of contact with men, and care, and hardship, and failure, and
success, and downs and ups and ups and downs, is just a trifle the
superior of a young fellow like you, who doesn’t know how to do anything
that’s valuable, can’t earn his living in any secure and steady way,
hasn’t had any experience of life and its seriousness, hasn’t any
culture but the artificial culture of books, which adorns but doesn’t
really educate –come! if I wouldn’t scorn an earldom, what the devil
right have you to do it!“</p>
<p>Tracy dissembled his joy, though he wanted to thank the chair-maker
for that last remark. Presently a thought struck him, and he spoke up
briskly and said:</p>
<p>“But look here, I really can’t quite get the hang of your
notions–your, principles, if they are principles. You are inconsistent.
You are opposed to aristocracies, yet you’d take an earldom if you
could. Am I to understand that you don’t blame an earl for being and
remaining an earl?“</p>
<p>“I certainly don’t.“</p>
<p>“And you wouldn’t blame Tompkins, or yourself, or me, or anybody, for
accepting an earldom if it was offered?“</p>
<p>“Indeed I wouldn’t.“</p>
<p>“Well, then, who would you blame?“</p>
<p>“The whole nation–any bulk and mass of population anywhere, in any
country, that will put up with the infamy, the outrage, the insult of a
hereditary aristocracy which they can’t enter–and on absolutely free and
equal terms.“</p>
<p>“Come, aren’t you beclouding yourself with distinctions that are not
differences?“</p>
<p>“Indeed I am not. I am entirely clear-headed about this thing. If I
could extirpate an aristocratic system by declining its honors, then I
should be a rascal to accept them. And if enough of the mass would join
me to make the extirpation possible, then I should be a rascal to do
otherwise than help in the attempt.“</p>
<p>“I believe I understand–yes, I think I get the idea. You have no
blame for the lucky few who naturally decline to vacate the pleasant
nest they were born into, you only despise the all-powerful and stupid
mass of the nation for allowing the nest to exist.“</p>
<p>“That’s it, that’s it! You can get a simple thing through your head
if you work at it long enough.“</p>
<p>“Thanks.“</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it. And I’ll give you some sound advice: when you go
back; if you find your nation up and ready to abolish that hoary
affront, lend a hand; but if that isn’t the state of things and you get
a chance at an earldom, don’t you be a fool–you take it.“</p>
<p>Tracy responded with earnestness and enthusiasm:</p>
<p>“As I live, I’ll do it!“</p>
<p>Barrow laughed.</p>
<p>“I never saw such a fellow. I begin to think you’ve got a good deal
of imagination. With you, the idlest-fancy freezes into a reality at a
breath. Why, you looked, then, as if it wouldn’t astonish you if you did
tumble into an earldom.“</p>
<p>Tracy blushed. Barrow added: “Earldom! Oh, yes, take it, if it
offers; but meantime we’ll go on looking around, in a modest way, and if
you get a chance to superintend a sausage-stuffer at six or eight
dollars a week, you just trade off the earldom for a last year’s almanac
and stick to the sausage-stuffing,“</p>
