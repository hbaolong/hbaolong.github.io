<h4 id="chapter-vi.">CHAPTER VI.</h4>
<p>Our new conductor (just shipped) had been without sleep for twenty
hours. Such a thing was very frequent. From St. Joseph, Missouri, to
Sacramento, California, by stage-coach, was nearly nineteen hundred
miles, and the trip was often made in fifteen days (the cars do it in
four and a half, now), but the time specified in the mail contracts, and
required by the schedule, was eighteen or nineteen days, if I remember
rightly. This was to make fair allowance for winter storms and snows,
and other unavoidable causes of detention. The stage company had
everything under strict discipline and good system. Over each two
hundred and fifty miles of road they placed an agent or superintendent,
and invested him with great authority. His beat or jurisdiction of two
hundred and fifty miles was called a “division.“ He purchased horses,
mules harness, and food for men and beasts, and distributed these things
among his stage stations, from time to time, according to his judgment
of what each station needed. He erected station buildings and dug wells.
He attended to the paying of the station-keepers, hostlers, drivers and
blacksmiths, and discharged them whenever he chose. He was a very, very
great man in his “division“–a kind of Grand Mogul, a Sultan of the
Indies, in whose presence common men were modest of speech and manner,
and in the glare of whose greatness even the dazzling stage-driver
dwindled to a penny dip. There were about eight of these kings, all
told, on the overland route.</p>
<p>Next in rank and importance to the division-agent came the
“conductor.“ His beat was the same length as the agent’s–two hundred and
fifty miles. He sat with the driver, and (when necessary) rode that
fearful distance, night and day, without other rest or sleep than what
he could get perched thus on top of the flying vehicle. Think of it! He
had absolute charge of the mails, express matter, passengers and stage,
coach, until he delivered them to the next conductor, and got his
receipt for them.</p>
<p>Consequently he had to be a man of intelligence, decision and
considerable executive ability. He was usually a quiet, pleasant man,
who attended closely to his duties, and was a good deal of a gentleman.
It was not absolutely necessary that the division-agent should be a
gentleman, and occasionally he wasn’t. But he was always a general in
administrative ability, and a bull-dog in courage and determination
–otherwise the chieftainship over the lawless underlings of the overland
service would never in any instance have been to him anything but an
equivalent for a month of insolence and distress and a bullet and a
coffin at the end of it. There were about sixteen or eighteen conductors
on the overland, for there was a daily stage each way, and a conductor
on every stage.</p>
<p>Next in real and official rank and importance, after the conductor,
came my delight, the driver–next in real but not in apparent
importance–for we have seen that in the eyes of the common herd the
driver was to the conductor as an admiral is to the captain of the
flag-ship. The driver’s beat was pretty long, and his sleeping-time at
the stations pretty short, sometimes; and so, but for the grandeur of
his position his would have been a sorry life, as well as a hard and a
wearing one. We took a new driver every day or every night (for they
drove backward and forward over the same piece of road all the time),
and therefore we never got as well acquainted with them as we did with
the conductors; and besides, they would have been above being familiar
with such rubbish as passengers, anyhow, as a general thing. Still, we
were always eager to get a sight of each and every new driver as soon as
the watch changed, for each and every day we were either anxious to get
rid of an unpleasant one, or loath to part with a driver we had learned
to like and had come to be sociable and friendly with. And so the first
question we asked the conductor whenever we got to where we were to
exchange drivers, was always, “Which is him?“ The grammar was faulty,
maybe, but we could not know, then, that it would go into a book some
day. As long as everything went smoothly, the overland driver was well
enough situated, but if a fellow driver got sick suddenly it made
trouble, for the coach must go on, and so the potentate who was about to
climb down and take a luxurious rest after his long night’s siege in the
midst of wind and rain and darkness, had to stay where he was and do the
sick man’s work. Once, in the Rocky Mountains, when I found a driver
sound asleep on the box, and the mules going at the usual break-neck
pace, the conductor said never mind him, there was no danger, and he was
doing double duty–had driven seventy-five miles on one coach, and was
now going back over it on this without rest or sleep. A hundred and
fifty miles of holding back of six vindictive mules and keeping them
from climbing the trees! It sounds incredible, but I remember the
statement well enough.</p>
<p>The station-keepers, hostlers, etc., were low, rough characters, as
already described; and from western Nebraska to Nevada a considerable
sprinkling of them might be fairly set down as outlaws–fugitives from
justice, criminals whose best security was a section of country which
was without law and without even the pretence of it. When the
“division-agent“ issued an order to one of these parties he did it with
the full understanding that he might have to enforce it with a navy
six-shooter, and so he always went “fixed“ to make things go along
smoothly.</p>
<p>Now and then a division-agent was really obliged to shoot a hostler
through the head to teach him some simple matter that he could have
taught him with a club if his circumstances and surroundings had been
different. But they were snappy, able men, those division-agents, and
when they tried to teach a subordinate anything, that subordinate
generally “got it through his head.“</p>
<p>A great portion of this vast machinery–these hundreds of men and
coaches, and thousands of mules and horses–was in the hands of Mr. Ben
Holliday. All the western half of the business was in his hands. This
reminds me of an incident of Palestine travel which is pertinent here,
so I will transfer it just in the language in which I find it set down
in my Holy Land note-book:</p>
<p>No doubt everybody has heard of Ben Holliday–a man of prodigious
energy, who used to send mails and passengers flying across the
continent in his overland stage-coaches like a very whirlwind–two
thousand long miles in fifteen days and a half, by the watch! But this
fragment of history is not about Ben Holliday, but about a young New
York boy by the name of Jack, who traveled with our small party of
pilgrims in the Holy Land (and who had traveled to California in
Mr. Holliday’s overland coaches three years before, and had by no means
forgotten it or lost his gushing admiration of Mr. H.) Aged nineteen.
Jack was a good boy–a good-hearted and always well-meaning boy, who had
been reared in the city of New York, and although he was bright and knew
a great many useful things, his Scriptural education had been a good
deal neglected–to such a degree, indeed, that all Holy Land history was
fresh and new to him, and all Bible names mysteries that had never
disturbed his virgin ear.</p>
<p>Also in our party was an elderly pilgrim who was the reverse of Jack,
in that he was learned in the Scriptures and an enthusiast concerning
them. He was our encyclopedia, and we were never tired of listening to
his speeches, nor he of making them. He never passed a celebrated
locality, from Bashan to Bethlehem, without illuminating it with an
oration. One day, when camped near the ruins of Jericho, he burst forth
with something like this:</p>
<p>“Jack, do you see that range of mountains over yonder that bounds the
Jordan valley? The mountains of Moab, Jack! Think of it, my boy–the
actual mountains of Moab–renowned in Scripture history! We are actually
standing face to face with those illustrious crags and peaks–and for all
we know“ [dropping his voice impressively], “our eyes may be resting at
this very moment upon the spot WHERE LIES THE MYSTERIOUS GRAVE OF MOSES!
Think of it, Jack!“</p>
<p>“Moses who?“ (falling inflection).</p>
<p>“Moses who! Jack, you ought to be ashamed of yourself–you ought to be
ashamed of such criminal ignorance. Why, Moses, the great guide,
soldier, poet, lawgiver of ancient Israel! Jack, from this spot where we
stand, to Egypt, stretches a fearful desert three hundred miles in
extent–and across that desert that wonderful man brought the children of
Israel!–guiding them with unfailing sagacity for forty years over the
sandy desolation and among the obstructing rocks and hills, and landed
them at last, safe and sound, within sight of this very spot; and where
we now stand they entered the Promised Land with anthems of rejoicing!
It was a wonderful, wonderful thing to do, Jack! Think of it!“</p>
<p>“Forty years? Only three hundred miles? Humph! Ben Holliday would
have fetched them through in thirty-six hours!“</p>
<p>The boy meant no harm. He did not know that he had said anything that
was wrong or irreverent. And so no one scolded him or felt offended with
him–and nobody could but some ungenerous spirit incapable of excusing
the heedless blunders of a boy.</p>
<p>At noon on the fifth day out, we arrived at the “Crossing of the
South Platte,“ alias “Julesburg,“ alias “Overland City,“ four hundred
and seventy miles from St. Joseph–the strangest, quaintest, funniest
frontier town that our untraveled eyes had ever stared at and been
astonished with.</p>
