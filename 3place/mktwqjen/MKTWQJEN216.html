<h4 id="some-learned-fables-for-good-old-boys-and-girls">SOME LEARNED
FABLES, FOR GOOD OLD BOYS AND GIRLS</h4>
<p>IN THREE PARTS</p>
<p>PART FIRST</p>
<p>HOW THE ANIMALS OF THE WOOD SENT OUT A SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION</p>
<p>Once the creatures of the forest held a great convention and
appointed a commission consisting of the most illustrious scientists
among them to go forth, clear beyond the forest and out into the unknown
and unexplored world, to verify the truth of the matters already taught
in their schools and colleges and also to make discoveries. It was the
most imposing enterprise of the kind the nation had ever embarked in.
True, the government had once sent Dr. Bull Frog, with a picked crew, to
hunt for a northwesterly passage through the swamp to the right-hand
corner of the wood, and had since sent out many expeditions to hunt for
Dr. Bull Frog; but they never could find him, and so government finally
gave him up and ennobled his mother to show its gratitude for the
services her son had rendered to science. And once government sent Sir
Grass Hopper to hunt for the sources of the rill that emptied into the
swamp; and afterward sent out many expeditions to hunt for Sir Grass,
and at last they were successful–they found his body, but if he had
discovered the sources meantime, he did not let on. So government acted
handsomely by deceased, and many envied his funeral.</p>
<p>But these expeditions were trifles compared with the present one; for
this one comprised among its servants the very greatest among the
learned; and besides it was to go to the utterly unvisited regions
believed to lie beyond the mighty forest–as we have remarked before. How
the members were banqueted, and glorified, and talked about! Everywhere
that one of them showed himself, straightway there was a crowd to gape
and stare at him.</p>
<p>Finally they set off, and it was a sight to see the long procession
of dry-land Tortoises heavily laden with savants, scientific
instruments, Glow-Worms and Fire-Flies for signal service, provisions,
Ants and Tumble-Bugs to fetch and carry and delve, Spiders to carry the
surveying chain and do other engineering duty, and so forth and so on;
and after the Tortoises came another long train of ironclads–stately and
spacious Mud Turtles for marine transportation service; and from every
Tortoise and every Turtle flaunted a flaming gladiolus or other splendid
banner; at the head of the column a great band of Bumble-Bees,
Mosquitoes, Katy-Dids, and Crickets discoursed martial music; and the
entire train was under the escort and protection of twelve picked
regiments of the Army Worm.</p>
<p>At the end of three weeks the expedition emerged from the forest and
looked upon the great Unknown World. Their eyes were greeted with an
impressive spectacle. A vast level plain stretched before them, watered
by a sinuous stream; and beyond there towered up against the sky along
and lofty barrier of some kind, they did not know what. The Tumble-Bug
said he believed it was simply land tilted up on its edge, because he
knew he could see trees on it. But Professor Snail and the others
said:</p>
<p>“You are hired to dig, sir–that is all. We need your muscle, not your
brains. When we want your opinion on scientific matters, we will hasten
to let you know. Your coolness is intolerable, too–loafing about here
meddling with august matters of learning, when the other laborers are
pitching camp. Go along and help handle the baggage.“</p>
<p>The Tumble-Bug turned on his heel uncrushed, unabashed, observing to
himself, “If it isn’t land tilted up, let me die the death of the
unrighteous.“</p>
<p>Professor Bull Frog (nephew of the late explorer) said he believed
the ridge was the wall that inclosed the earth. He continued:</p>
<p>“Our fathers have left us much learning, but they had not traveled
far, and so we may count this a noble new discovery. We are safe for
renown now, even though our labors began and ended with this single
achievement. I wonder what this wall is built of? Can it be fungus?
Fungus is an honorable good thing to build a wall of.“</p>
<p>Professor Snail adjusted his field-glass and examined the rampart
critically. Finally he said:</p>
<p>“’The fact that it is not diaphanous convinces me that it is a dense
vapor formed by the calorification of ascending moisture
dephlogisticated by refraction. A few endiometrical experiments would
confirm this, but it is not necessary. The thing is obvious.“</p>
<p>So he shut up his glass and went into his shell to make a note of the
discovery of the world’s end, and the nature of it.</p>
<p>“Profound mind!“ said Professor Angle-Worm to Professor Field-Mouse;
“profound mind! nothing can long remain a mystery to that august
brain.“</p>
<p>Night drew on apace, the sentinel crickets were posted, the Glow-Worm
and Fire-Fly lamps were lighted, and the camp sank to silence and sleep.
After breakfast in the morning, the expedition moved on. About noon a
great avenue was reached, which had in it two endless parallel bars of
some kind of hard black substance, raised the height of the tallest Bull
Frog, above the general level. The scientists climbed up on these and
examined and tested them in various ways. They walked along them for a
great distance, but found no end and no break in them. They could arrive
at no decision. There was nothing in the records of science that
mentioned anything of this kind. But at last the bald and venerable
geographer, Professor Mud Turtle, a person who, born poor, and of a
drudging low family, had, by his own native force raised himself to the
headship of the geographers of his generation, said:</p>
<p>“’My friends, we have indeed made a discovery here. We have found in
a palpable, compact, and imperishable state what the wisest of our
fathers always regarded as a mere thing of the imagination. Humble
yourselves, my friends, for we stand in a majestic presence. These are
parallels of latitude!“</p>
<p>Every heart and every head was bowed, so awful, so sublime was the
magnitude of the discovery. Many shed tears.</p>
<p>The camp was pitched and the rest of the day given up to writing
voluminous accounts of the marvel, and correcting astronomical tables to
fit it. Toward midnight a demoniacal shriek was heard, then a clattering
and rumbling noise, and the next instant a vast terrific eye shot by,
with a long tail attached, and disappeared in the gloom, still uttering
triumphant shrieks.</p>
<p>The poor damp laborers were stricken to the heart with fright, and
stampeded for the high grass in a body. But not the scientists. They had
no superstitions. They calmly proceeded to exchange theories. The
ancient geographer’s opinion was asked. He went into his shell and
deliberated long and profoundly. When he came out at last, they all knew
by his worshiping countenance that he brought light. Said he:</p>
<p>“Give thanks for this stupendous thing which we have been permitted
to witness. It is the Vernal Equinox!“</p>
<p>There were shoutings and great rejoicings.</p>
<p>“But,“ said the Angle-Worm, uncoiling after reflection, “this is dead
summer-time.“</p>
<p>“Very well,“ said the Turtle, “we are far from our region; the season
differs with the difference of time between the two points.“</p>
<p>“Ah, true: True enough. But it is night. How should the sun pass in
the night?“</p>
<p>“In these distant regions he doubtless passes always in the night at
this hour.“</p>
<p>“Yes, doubtless that is true. But it being night, how is it that we
could see him?“</p>
<p>“It is a great mystery. I grant that. But I am persuaded that the
humidity of the atmosphere in these remote regions is such that
particles of daylight adhere to the disk and it was by aid of these that
we were enabled to see the sun in the dark.“</p>
<p>This was deemed satisfactory, and due entry was made of the
decision.</p>
<p>But about this moment those dreadful shriekings were heard again;
again the rumbling and thundering came speeding up out of the night; and
once more a flaming great eye flashed by and lost itself in gloom and
distance.</p>
<p>The camp laborers gave themselves up for lost. The savants were
sorely perplexed. Here was a marvel hard to account for. They thought
and they talked, they talked and they thought. Finally the learned and
aged Lord Grand-Daddy-Longlegs, who had been sitting in deep study, with
his slender limbs crossed and his stemmy arms folded, said:</p>
<p>“Deliver your opinions, brethren, and then I will tell my thought–for
I think I have solved this problem.“</p>
<p>“So be it, good your lordship,“ piped the weak treble of the wrinkled
and withered Professor Woodlouse, “for we shall hear from your
lordship’s lips naught but wisdom.“ [Here the speaker threw in a mess of
trite, threadbare, exasperating quotations from the ancient poets and
philosophers, delivering them with unction in the sounding grandeurs of
the original tongues, they being from the Mastodon, the Dodo, and other
dead languages.] “Perhaps I ought not to presume to meddle with matters
pertaining to astronomy at all, in such a presence as this, I who have
made it the business of my life to delve only among the riches of the
extinct languages and unearth the opulence of their ancient lore; but
still, as unacquainted as I am with the noble science of astronomy, I
beg with deference and humility to suggest that inasmuch as the last of
these wonderful apparitions proceeded in exactly the opposite direction
from that pursued by the first, which you decide to be the Vernal
Equinox, and greatly resembled it in all particulars, is it not
possible, nay certain, that this last is the Autumnal Equi–“</p>
<p>“O-o-o!“ “O-o-o! go to bed! go to bed!“ with annoyed derision from
everybody. So the poor old Woodlouse retreated out of sight, consumed
with shame.</p>
<p>Further discussion followed, and then the united voice of the
commission begged Lord Longlegs to speak. He said:</p>
<p>“Fellow-scientists, it is my belief that we have witnessed a thing
which has occurred in perfection but once before in the knowledge of
created beings. It is a phenomenon of inconceivable importance and
interest, view it as one may, but its interest to us is vastly
heightened by an added knowledge of its nature which no scholar has
heretofore possessed or even suspected. This great marvel which we have
just witnessed, fellow-savants (it almost takes my breath away), is
nothing less than the transit of Venus!“</p>
<p>Every scholar sprang to his feet pale with astonishment. Then ensued
tears, handshakings, frenzied embraces, and the most extravagant
jubilations of every sort. But by and by, as emotion began to retire
within bounds, and reflection to return to the front, the accomplished
Chief Inspector Lizard observed:</p>
<p>“But how is this? Venus should traverse the sun’s surface, not the
earth’s.“</p>
<p>The arrow went home. It earned sorrow to the breast of every apostle
of learning there, for none could deny that this was a formidable
criticism. But tranquilly the venerable Duke crossed his limbs behind
his ears and said:</p>
<p>“My friend has touched the marrow of our mighty discovery. Yes–all
that have lived before us thought a transit of Venus consisted of a
flight across the sun’s face; they thought it, they maintained it, they
honestly believed it, simple hearts, and were justified in it by the
limitations of their knowledge; but to us has been granted the
inestimable boon of proving that the transit occurs across the earth’s
face, for we have SEEN it!“</p>
<p>The assembled wisdom sat in speechless adoration of this imperial
intellect. All doubts had instantly departed, like night before the
lightning.</p>
<p>The Tumble-Bug had just intruded, unnoticed. He now came reeling
forward among the scholars, familiarly slapping first one and then
another on the shoulder, saying “Nice (’ic) nice old boy!“ and smiling a
smile of elaborate content. Arrived at a good position for speaking, he
put his left arm akimbo with his knuckles planted in his hip just under
the edge of his cut-away coat, bent his right leg, placing his toe on
the ground and resting his heel with easy grace against his left shin,
puffed out his aldermanic stomach, opened his lips, leaned his right
elbow on Inspector Lizard’s shoulder, and–</p>
<p>But the shoulder was indignantly withdrawn and the hard-handed son of
toil went to earth. He floundered a bit, but came up smiling, arranged
his attitude with the same careful detail as before, only choosing
Professor Dogtick’s shoulder for a support, opened his lips and–</p>
<p>Went to earth again. He presently scrambled up once more, still
smiling, made a loose effort to brush the dust off his coat and legs,
but a smart pass of his hand missed entirely, and the force of the
unchecked impulse stewed him suddenly around, twisted his legs together,
and projected him, limber and sprawling, into the lap of the Lord
Longlegs. Two or three scholars sprang forward, flung the low creature
head over heels into a corner, and reinstated the patrician, smoothing
his ruffled dignity with many soothing and regretful speeches. Professor
Bull Frog roared out:</p>
<p>“No more of this, sirrah Tumble-Bug! Say your say and then get you
about your business with speed! Quick–what is your errand? Come move off
a trifle; you smell like a stable; what have you been at?“</p>
<p>“Please (’ic!) please your worship I chanced to light upon a find.
But no m(e-uck!) matter ’bout that. There’s b(’ic !) been another find
which–beg pardon, your honors, what was that th(’ic!) thing that ripped
by here first?“</p>
<p>“It was the Vernal Equinox.“</p>
<p>“Inf(’ic!)fernal equinox. ’At’s all right. D(’ic !) Dunno him. What’s
other one?“</p>
<p>“The transit of Venus.</p>
<p>“G(‘ic !) Got me again. No matter. Las’ one dropped something.“</p>
<p>“Ah, indeed! Good luck! Good news! Quick what is it?“</p>
<p>“M(‘ic!) Mosey out ’n’ see. It’ll pay.“</p>
<p>No more votes were taken for four-and-twenty hours. Then the
following entry was made:</p>
<p>“The commission went in a body to view the find. It was found to
consist of a hard, smooth, huge object with a rounded summit surmounted
by a short upright projection resembling a section of a cabbage stalk
divided transversely. This projection was not solid, but was a hollow
cylinder plugged with a soft woody substance unknown to our region–that
is, it had been so plugged, but unfortunately this obstruction had been
heedlessly removed by Norway Rat, Chief of the Sappers and Miners,
before our arrival. The vast object before us, so mysteriously conveyed
from the glittering domains of space, was found to be hollow and nearly
filled with a pungent liquid of a brownish hue, like rainwater that has
stood for some time. And such a spectacle as met our view! Norway Rat
was perched upon the summit engaged in thrusting his tail into the
cylindrical projection, drawing it out dripping, permitting the
struggling multitude of laborers to suck the end of it, then straightway
reinserting it and delivering the fluid to the mob as before. Evidently
this liquor had strangely potent qualities; for all that partook of it
were immediately exalted with great and pleasurable emotions, and went
staggering about singing ribald songs, embracing, fighting, dancing,
discharging irruptions of profanity, and defying all authority. Around
us struggled a massed and uncontrolled mob–uncontrolled and likewise
uncontrollable, for the whole army, down to the very sentinels, were mad
like the rest, by reason of the drink. We were seized upon by these
reckless creatures, and within the hour we, even we, were
undistinguishable from the rest–the demoralization was complete and
universal. In time the camp wore itself out with its orgies and sank
into a stolid and pitiable stupor, in whose mysterious bonds rank was
forgotten and strange bedfellows made, our eyes, at the resurrection,
being blasted and our souls petrified with the incredible spectacle of
that intolerable stinking scavenger, the Tumble-Bug, and the illustrious
patrician my Lord Grand Daddy, Duke of Longlegs, lying soundly steeped
in sleep, and clasped lovingly in each other’s arms, the like whereof
hath not been seen in all the ages that tradition compasseth, and
doubtless none shall ever in this world find faith to master the belief
of it save only we that have beheld the damnable and unholy vision. Thus
inscrutable be the ways of God, whose will be done!</p>
<p>“This day, by order, did the engineer-in-chief, Herr Spider, rig the
necessary tackle for the overturning of the vast reservoir, and so its
calamitous contents were discharged in a torrent upon the thirsty earth,
which drank it up, and now there is no more danger, we reserving but a
few drops for experiment and scrutiny, and to exhibit to the king and
subsequently preserve among the wonders of the museum. What this liquid
is has been determined. It is without question that fierce and most
destructive fluid called lightning. It was wrested, in its container,
from its storehouse in the clouds, by the resistless might of the flying
planet, and hurled at our feet as she sped by. An interesting discovery
here results. Which is, that lightning, kept to itself, is quiescent; it
is the assaulting contact of the thunderbolt that releases it from
captivity, ignites its awful fires, and so produces an instantaneous
combustion and explosion which spread disaster and desolation far and
wide in the earth.“</p>
<p>After another day devoted to rest and recovery, the expedition
proceeded upon its way. Some days later it went into camp in a pleasant
part of the plain, and the savants sallied forth to see what they might
find. Their reward was at hand. Professor Bull Frog discovered a strange
tree, and called his comrades. They inspected it with profound interest.
It was very tall and straight, and wholly devoid of bark, limbs, or
foliage. By triangulation Lord Longlegs determined its altitude; Herr
Spider measured its circumference at the base and computed the
circumference at its top by a mathematical demonstration based upon the
warrant furnished by the uniform degree of its taper upward. It was
considered a very extraordinary find; and since it was a tree of a
hitherto unknown species, Professor Woodlouse gave it a name of a
learned sound, being none other than that of Professor Bull Frog
translated into the ancient Mastodon language, for it had always been
the custom with discoverers to perpetuate their names and honor
themselves by this sort of connection with their discoveries.</p>
<p>Now Professor Field-Mouse having placed his sensitive ear to the
tree, detected a rich, harmonious sound issuing from it. This surprising
thing was tested and enjoyed by each scholar in turn, and great was the
gladness and astonishment of all. Professor Woodlouse was requested to
add to and extend the tree’s name so as to make it suggest the musical
quality it possessed–which he did, furnishing the addition Anthem
Singer, done into the Mastodon tongue.</p>
<p>By this time Professor Snail was making some telescopic inspections.
He discovered a great number of these trees, extending in a single rank,
with wide intervals between, as far as his instrument would carry, both
southward and northward. He also presently discovered that all these
trees were bound together, near their tops, by fourteen great ropes, one
above another, which ropes were continuous, from tree to tree, as far as
his vision could reach. This was surprising. Chief Engineer Spider ran
aloft and soon reported that these ropes were simply a web hung thereby
some colossal member of his own species, for he could see its prey
dangling here and there from the strands, in the shape of mighty shreds
and rags that had a woven look about their texture and were no doubt the
discarded skins of prodigious insects which had been caught and eaten.
And then he ran along one of the ropes to make a closer inspection, but
felt a smart sudden burn on the soles of his feet, accompanied by a
paralyzing shock, wherefore he let go and swung himself to the earth by
a thread of his own spinning, and advised all to hurry at once to camp,
lest the monster should appear and get as much interested in the savants
as they were in him and his works. So they departed with speed, making
notes about the gigantic web as they went. And that evening the
naturalist of the expedition built a beautiful model of the colossal
spider, having no need to see it in order to do this, because he had
picked up a fragment of its vertebra by the tree, and so knew exactly
what the creature looked like and what its habits and its preferences
were by this simple evidence alone. He built it with a tail, teeth,
fourteen legs, and a snout, and said it ate grass, cattle, pebbles, and
dirt with equal enthusiasm. This animal was regarded as a very precious
addition to science. It was hoped a dead one might be found to stuff.
Professor Woodlouse thought that he and his brother scholars, by lying
hid and being quiet, might maybe catch a live one. He was advised to try
it. Which was all the attention that was paid to his suggestion. The
conference ended with the naming the monster after the naturalist, since
he, after God, had created it.</p>
<p>“And improved it, mayhap,“ muttered the Tumble-Bug, who was intruding
again, according to his idle custom and his unappeasable curiosity.</p>
<p>END OF PART FIRST</p>
<p>SOME LEARNED FABLES FOR GOOD OLD BOYS AND GIRLS</p>
<p>PART SECOND</p>
<p>HOW THE ANIMALS OF THE WOOD COMPLETED THEIR SCIENTIFIC LABORS</p>
<p>A week later the expedition camped in the midst of a collection of
wonderful curiosities. These were a sort of vast caverns of stone that
rose singly and in bunches out of the plain by the side of the river
which they had first seen when they emerged from the forest. These
caverns stood in long, straight rows on opposite sides of broad aisles
that were bordered with single ranks of trees. The summit of each cavern
sloped sharply both ways. Several horizontal rows of great square holes,
obstructed by a thin, shiny, transparent substance, pierced the frontage
of each cavern. Inside were caverns within caverns; and one might ascend
and visit these minor compartments by means of curious winding ways
consisting of continuous regular terraces raised one above another.
There were many huge, shapeless objects in each compartment which were
considered to have been living creatures at one time, though now the
thin brown skin was shrunken and loose, and rattled when disturbed.
Spiders were here in great number, and their cobwebs, stretched in all
directions and wreathing the great skinny dead together, were a pleasant
spectacle, since they inspired with life and wholesome cheer a scene
which would otherwise have brought to the mind only a sense of
forsakenness and desolation. Information was sought of these spiders,
but in vain. They were of a different nationality from those with the
expedition, and their language seemed but a musical, meaningless jargon.
They were a timid, gentle race, but ignorant, and heathenish worshipers
of unknown gods. The expedition detailed a great detachment of
missionaries to teach them the true religion, and in a week’s time a
precious work had been wrought among those darkened creatures, not three
families being by that time at peace with each other or having a settled
belief in any system of religion whatever. This encouraged the
expedition to establish a colony of missionaries there permanently, that
the work of grace might go on.</p>
<p>But let us not outrun our narrative. After close examination of the
fronts of the caverns, and much thinking and exchanging of theories, the
scientists determined the nature of these singular formations. They said
that each belonged mainly to the Old Red Sandstone period; that the
cavern fronts rose in innumerable and wonderfully regular strata high in
the air, each stratum about five frog-spans thick, and that in the
present discovery lay an overpowering refutation of all received
geology; for between every two layers of Old Red Sandstone reposed a
thin layer of decomposed limestone; so instead of there having been but
one Old Red Sandstone period there had certainly been not less than a
hundred and seventy-five! And by the same token it was plain that there
had also been a hundred and seventy-five floodings of the earth and
depositings of limestone strata! The unavoidable deduction from which
pair of facts was the overwhelming truth that the world, instead of
being only two hundred thousand years old, was older by millions upon
millions of years! And there was another curious thing: every stratum of
Old Red Sandstone was pierced and divided at mathematically regular
intervals by vertical strata of limestone. Up-shootings of igneous rock
through fractures in water formations were common; but here was the
first instance where water-formed rock had been so projected. It was a
great and noble discovery, and its value to science was considered to be
inestimable.</p>
<p>A critical examination of some of the lower strata demonstrated the
presence of fossil ants and tumble-bugs (the latter accompanied by their
peculiar goods), and with high gratification the fact was enrolled upon
the scientific record; for this was proof that these vulgar laborers
belonged to the first and lowest orders of created beings, though at the
same time there was something repulsive in the reflection that the
perfect and exquisite creature of the modern uppermost order owed its
origin to such ignominious beings through the mysterious law of
Development of Species.</p>
<p>The Tumble-Bug, overhearing this discussion, said he was willing that
the parvenus of these new times should find what comfort they might in
their wise-drawn theories, since as far as he was concerned he was
content to be of the old first families and proud to point back to his
place among the old original aristocracy of the land.</p>
<p>“Enjoy your mushroom dignity, stinking of the varnish of yesterday’s
veneering, since you like it,“ said he; “suffice it for the Tumble-Bugs
that they come of a race that rolled their fragrant spheres down the
solemn aisles of antiquity, and left their imperishable works embalmed
in the Old Red Sandstone to proclaim it to the wasting centuries as they
file along the highway of Time!“</p>
<p>“Oh, take a walk!“ said the chief of the expedition, with
derision.</p>
<p>The summer passed, and winter approached. In and about many of the
caverns were what seemed to be inscriptions. Most of the scientists said
they were inscriptions, a few said they were not. The chief philologist,
Professor Woodlouse, maintained that they were writings, done in a
character utterly unknown to scholars, and in a language equally
unknown. He had early ordered his artists and draftsmen to make
facsimiles of all that were discovered; and had set himself about
finding the key to the hidden tongue. In this work he had followed the
method which had always been used by decipherers previously. That is to
say, he placed a number of copies of inscriptions before him and studied
them both collectively and in detail. To begin with, he placed the
following copies together:</p>
<p>THE AMERICAN HOTEL. MEALS AT ALL HOURS. THE SHADES. NO SMOKING. BOATS
FOR HIRE CHEAP UNION PRAYER MEETING, 6 P.M. BILLIARDS. THE WATERSIDE
JOURNAL. THE A1 BARBER SHOP. TELEGRAPH OFFICE. KEEP OFF THE GRASS. TRY
BRANDRETH’S PILLS. COTTAGES FOR RENT DURING THE WATERING SEASON. FOR
SALE CHEAP. FOR SALE CHEAP. FOR SALE CHEAP. FOR SALE CHEAP.</p>
<p>At first it seemed to the professor that this was a sign-language,
and that each word was represented by a distinct sign; further
examination convinced him that it was a written language, and that every
letter of its alphabet was represented by a character of its own; and
finally he decided that it was a language which conveyed itself partly
by letters, and partly by signs or hieroglyphics. This conclusion was
forced upon him by the discovery of several specimens of the following
nature:</p>
<p>He observed that certain inscriptions were met with in greater
frequency than others. Such as “FOR SALE CHEAP“; “BILLIARDS“; “S.
T.–1860–X“; “KENO“; “ALE ON DRAUGHT.“ Naturally, then, these must be
religious maxims. But this idea was cast aside by and by, as the mystery
of the strange alphabet began to clear itself. In time, the professor
was enabled to translate several of the inscriptions with considerable
plausibility, though not to the perfect satisfaction of all the
scholars. Still, he made constant and encouraging progress.</p>
<p>Finally a cavern was discovered with these inscriptions upon it:</p>
<p>WATERSIDE MUSEUM. Open at All Hours. Admission 50 cents. WONDERFUL
COLLECTION OF WAX-WORKS, ANCIENT FOSSILS, ETC.</p>
<p>Professor Woodlouse affirmed that the word “Museum“ was equivalent to
the phrase “lumgath molo,“ or “Burial Place.“ Upon entering, the
scientists were well astonished. But what they saw may be best conveyed
in the language of their own official report:</p>
<p>“Erect, in a row, were a sort of rigid great figures which struck us
instantly as belonging to the long extinct species of reptile called
MAN, described in our ancient records. This was a peculiarly gratifying
discovery, because of late times it has become fashionable to regard
this creature as a myth and a superstition, a work of the inventive
imaginations of our remote ancestors. But here, indeed, was Man,
perfectly preserved, in a fossil state. And this was his burial place,
as already ascertained by the inscription. And now it began to be
suspected that the caverns we had been inspecting had been his ancient
haunts in that old time that he roamed the earth–for upon the breast of
each of these tall fossils was an inscription in the character
heretofore noticed. One read, ‘CAPTAIN KIDD THE PIRATE’; another, ‘QUEEN
VICTORIA’; another, ‘ABE LINCOLN’; another, ‘GEORGE WASHINGTON,’
etc.</p>
<p>“With feverish interest we called for our ancient scientific records
to discover if perchance the description of Man there set down would
tally with the fossils before us. Professor Woodlouse read it aloud in
its quaint and musty phraseology, to wit:</p>
<p>“‘In ye time of our fathers Man still walked ye earth, as by
tradition we know. It was a creature of exceeding great size, being
compassed about with a loose skin, sometimes of one color, sometimes of
many, the which it was able to cast at will; which being done, the hind
legs were discovered to be armed with short claws like to a mole’s but
broader, and ye forelegs with fingers of a curious slimness and a length
much more prodigious than a frog’s, armed also with broad talons for
scratching in ye earth for its food. It had a sort of feathers upon its
head such as hath a rat, but longer, and a beak suitable for seeking its
food by ye smell thereof. When it was stirred with happiness, it leaked
water from its eyes; and when it suffered or was sad, it manifested it
with a horrible hellish cackling clamor that was exceeding dreadful to
hear and made one long that it might rend itself and perish, and so end
its troubles. Two Mans being together, they uttered noises at each other
like this: “Haw-haw-haw–dam good, dam good,“ together with other sounds
of more or less likeness to these, wherefore ye poets conceived that
they talked, but poets be always ready to catch at any frantic folly,
God he knows. Sometimes this creature goeth about with a long stick ye
which it putteth to its face and bloweth fire and smoke through ye same
with a sudden and most damnable bruit and noise that doth fright its
prey to death, and so seizeth it in its talons and walketh away to its
habitat, consumed with a most fierce and devilish joy.’</p>
<p>“Now was the description set forth by our ancestors wonderfully
indorsed and confirmed by the fossils before us, as shall be seen. The
specimen marked ‘Captain Kidd’ was examined in detail. Upon its head and
part of its face was a sort of fur like that upon the tail of a horse.
With great labor its loose skin was removed, whereupon its body was
discovered to be of a polished white texture, thoroughly petrified. The
straw it had eaten, so many ages gone by, was still in its body,
undigested–and even in its legs.</p>
<p>“Surrounding these fossils were objects that would mean nothing to
the ignorant, but to the eye of science they were a revelation. They
laid bare the secrets of dead ages. These musty Memorials told us when
Man lived, and what were his habits. For here, side by side with Man,
were the evidences that he had lived in the earliest ages of creation,
the companion of the other low orders of life that belonged to that
forgotten time. Here was the fossil nautilus that sailed the primeval
seas; here was the skeleton of the mastodon, the ichthyosaurus, the
cave-bear, the prodigious elk. Here, also, were the charred bones of
some of these extinct animals and of the young of Man’s own species,
split lengthwise, showing that to his taste the marrow was a toothsome
luxury. It was plain that Man had robbed those bones of their contents,
since no tooth-mark of any beast was upon them albeit the Tumble-Bug
intruded the remark that ‘no beast could mark a bone with its teeth,
anyway.’ Here were proofs that Man had vague, groveling notions of art;
for this fact was conveyed by certain things marked with the
untranslatable words, ‘FLINT HATCHETS, KNIVES, ARROW–HEADS, AND BONE
ORNAMENTS OF PRIMEVAL MAN.’ Some of these seemed to be rude weapons
chipped out of flint, and in a secret place was found some more in
process of construction, with this untranslatable legend, on a thin,
flimsy material, lying by:</p>
<p>“‘Jones, if you don’t want to be discharged from the Musseum, make
the next primeaveal weppons more careful–you couldn’t even fool one of
these sleepy old syentific grannys from the Coledge with the last ones.
And mind you the animles you carved on some of the Bone Ornaments is a
blame sight too good for any primeaveal man that was ever
fooled.–Varnum, Manager.’</p>
<p>“Back of the burial place was a mass of ashes, showing that Man
always had a feast at a funeral–else why the ashes in such a place; and
showing, also, that he believed in God and the immortality of the soil
–else why these solemn ceremonies?</p>
<p>“To, sum up. We believe that Man had a written language. We know that
he indeed existed at one time, and is not a myth; also, that he was the
companion of the cave-bear, the mastodon, and other extinct species;
that he cooked and ate them and likewise the young of his own kind;
also, that he bore rude weapons, and knew something of art; that he
imagined he had a soul, and pleased himself with the fancy that it was
immortal. But let us not laugh; there may be creatures in existence to
whom we and our vanities and profundities may seem as ludicrous.“</p>
<p>END OF PART SECOND</p>
<p>SOME LEARNED FABLES FOR GOOD OLD BOYS AND GIRLS</p>
<p>PART THIRD</p>
<p>Near the margin of the great river the scientists presently found a
huge, shapely stone, with this inscription:</p>
<p>“In 1847, in the spring, the river overflowed its banks and covered
the whole township. The depth was from two to six feet. More than 900
head of cattle were lost, and many homes destroyed. The Mayor ordered
this memorial to be erected to perpetuate the event. God spare us the
repetition of it!“</p>
<p>With infinite trouble, Professor Woodlouse succeeded in making a
translation of this inscription, which was sent home, and straightway an
enormous excitement was created about it. It confirmed, in a remarkable
way, certain treasured traditions of the ancients. The translation was
slightly marred by one or two untranslatable words, but these did not
impair the general clearness of the meaning. It is here presented:</p>
<p>“One thousand eight hundred and forty-seven years ago, the (fires?)
descended and consumed the whole city. Only some nine hundred souls were
saved, all others destroyed. The (king?) commanded this stone to be set
up to . . . (untranslatable) . . . prevent the repetition of it.“</p>
<p>This was the first successful and satisfactory translation that had
been made of the mysterious character let behind him by extinct man, and
it gave Professor Woodlouse such reputation that at once every seat of
learning in his native land conferred a degree of the most illustrious
grade upon him, and it was believed that if he had been a soldier and
had turned his splendid talents to the extermination of a remote tribe
of reptiles, the king would have ennobled him and made him rich. And
this, too, was the origin of that school of scientists called
Manologists, whose specialty is the deciphering of the ancient records
of the extinct bird termed Man. [For it is now decided that Man was a
bird and not a reptile.] But Professor Woodlouse began and remained
chief of these, for it was granted that no translations were ever so
free from error as his. Others made mistakes he seemed incapable of it.
Many a memorial of the lost race was afterward found, but none ever
attained to the renown and veneration achieved by the “Mayoritish Stone“
it being so called from the word “Mayor“ in it, which, being translated
“King,“ “Mayoritish Stone“ was but another way of saying “King
Stone.“</p>
<p>Another time the expedition made a great “find.“ It was a vast round
flattish mass, ten frog-spans in diameter and five or six high.
Professor Snail put on his spectacles and examined it all around, and
then climbed up and inspected the top. He said:</p>
<p>“The result of my perlustration and perscontation of this
isoperimetrical protuberance is a belief at it is one of those rare and
wonderful creation left by the Mound Builders. The fact that this one is
lamellibranchiate in its formation, simply adds to its interest as being
possibly of a different kind from any we read of in the records of
science, but yet in no manner marring its authenticity. Let the
megalophonous grasshopper sound a blast and summon hither the
perfunctory and circumforaneous Tumble-Bug, to the end that excavations
may be made and learning gather new treasures.“</p>
<p>Not a Tumble-Bug could be found on duty, so the Mound was excavated
by a working party of Ants. Nothing was discovered. This would have been
a great disappointment, had not the venerable Longlegs explained the
matter. He said:</p>
<p>“It is now plain to me that the mysterious and forgotten race of
Mound Builders did not always erect these edifices as mausoleums, else
in this case, as in all previous cases, their skeletons would be found
here, along with the rude implements which the creatures used in life.
Is not this manifest?“</p>
<p>“True! true!“ from everybody.</p>
<p>“Then we have made a discovery of peculiar value here; a discovery
which greatly extends our knowledge of this creature in place of
diminishing it; a discovery which will add luster to the achievements of
this expedition and win for us the commendations of scholars everywhere.
For the absence of the customary relics here means nothing less than
this: The Mound Builder, instead of being the ignorant, savage reptile
we have been taught to consider him, was a creature of cultivation and
high intelligence, capable of not only appreciating worthy achievements
of the great and noble of his species, but of commemorating them!
Fellow-scholars, this stately Mound is not a sepulcher, it is a
monument!“</p>
<p>A profound impression was produced by this.</p>
<p>But it was interrupted by rude and derisive laughter–and the
Tumble-Bug appeared.</p>
<p>“A monument!“ quoth he. “A monument setup by a Mound Builder! Aye, so
it is! So it is, indeed, to the shrewd keen eye of science; but to an,
ignorant poor devil who has never seen a college, it is not a Monument,
strictly speaking, but is yet a most rich and noble property; and with
your worship’s good permission I will proceed to manufacture it into
spheres of exceedings grace and–“</p>
<p>The Tumble-Bug was driven away with stripes, and the draftsmen of the
expedition were set to making views of the Monument from different
standpoints, while Professor Woodlouse, in a frenzy of scientific zeal,
traveled all over it and all around it hoping to find an inscription.
But if there had ever been one, it had decayed or been removed by some
vandal as a relic.</p>
<p>The views having been completed, it was now considered safe to load
the precious Monument itself upon the backs of four of the largest
Tortoises and send it home to the king’s museum, which was done; and
when it arrived it was received with enormous Mat and escorted to its
future abiding-place by thousands of enthusiastic citizens, King
Bullfrog XVI. himself attending and condescending to sit enthroned upon
it throughout the progress.</p>
<p>The growing rigor of the weather was now admonishing the scientists
to close their labors for the present, so they made preparations to
journey homeward. But even their last day among the Caverns bore fruit;
for one of the scholars found in an out-of-the-way corner of the Museum
or “Burial Place“ a most strange and extraordinary thing. It was nothing
less than a double Man-Bird lashed together breast to breast by a
natural ligament, and labeled with the untranslatable words, “Siamese
Twins.“ The official report concerning this thing closed thus:</p>
<p>“Wherefore it appears that there were in old times two distinct
species of this majestic fowl, the one being single and the other
double. Nature has a reason for all things. It is plain to the eye of
science that the Double-Man originally inhabited a region where dangers
abounded; hence he was paired together to the end that while one part
slept the other might watch; and likewise that, danger being discovered,
there might always be a double instead of a single power to oppose it.
All honor to the mystery-dispelling eye of godlike Science!“</p>
<p>And near the Double Man-Bird was found what was plainly an ancient
record of his, marked upon numberless sheets of a thin white substance
and bound together. Almost the first glance that Professor Woodlouse
threw into it revealed this following sentence, which he instantly
translated and laid before the scientists, in a tremble, and it uplifted
every soul there with exultation and astonishment:</p>
<p>“In truth it is believed by many that the lower animals reason and
talk together.“</p>
<p>When the great official report of the expedition appeared, the above
sentence bore this comment:</p>
<p>“Then there are lower animals than Man! This remarkable passage can
mean nothing else. Man himself is extinct, but they may still exist.
What can they be? Where do they inhabit? One’s enthusiasm bursts all
bounds in the contemplation of the brilliant field of discovery and
investigation here thrown open to science. We close our labors with the
humble prayer that your Majesty will immediately appoint a commission
and command it to rest not nor spare expense until the search for this
hitherto unsuspected race of the creatures of God shall be crowned with
success.“</p>
<p>The expedition then journeyed homeward after its long absence and its
faithful endeavors, and was received with a mighty ovation by the whole
grateful country. There were vulgar, ignorant carpers, of course, as
there always are and always will be; and naturally one of these was the
obscene Tumble-Bug. He said that all he had learned by his travels was
that science only needed a spoonful of supposition to build a mountain
of demonstrated fact out of; and that for the future he meant to be
content with the knowledge that nature had made free to all creatures
and not go prying into the august secrets of the Deity.</p>
<p>MY LATE SENATORIAL SECRETARYSHIP–[Written about 1867.]</p>
<p>I am not a private secretary to a senator any more I now. I held the
berth two months in security and in great cheerfulness of spirit, but my
bread began to return from over the waters then–that is to say, my works
came back and revealed themselves. I judged it best to resign. The way
of it was this. My employer sent for me one morning tolerably early,
and, as soon as I had finished inserting some conundrums clandestinely
into his last great speech upon finance, I entered the presence. There
was something portentous in his appearance. His cravat was untied, his
hair was in a state of disorder, and his countenance bore about it the
signs of a suppressed storm. He held a package of letters in his tense
grasp, and I knew that the dreaded Pacific mail was in. He said:</p>
<p>“I thought you were worthy of confidence.“</p>
<p>I said, “Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>He said, “I gave you a letter from certain of my constituents in the
State of Nevada, asking the establishment of a post-office at Baldwin’s
Ranch, and told you to answer it, as ingeniously as you could, with
arguments which should persuade them that there was no real necessity
for as office at that place.“</p>
<p>I felt easier. “Oh, if that is all, sir, I did do that.“</p>
<p>“Yes, you did. I will read your answer for your own humiliation:</p>
<p>’WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 ’Messrs. Smith, Jones, and others.</p>
<p>‘GENTLEMEN: What the mischief do you suppose you want with a
post-office at Baldwin’s Ranch? It would not do you any good. If any
letters came there, you couldn’t read them, you know; and, besides, such
letters as ought to pass through, with money in them, for other
localities, would not be likely to get through, you must perceive at
once; and that would make trouble for us all. No, don’t bother about a
post-office in your camp. I have your best interests at heart, and feel
that it would only be an ornamental folly. What you want is a nice jail,
you know–a nice, substantial jail and a free school. These will be a
lasting benefit to you. These will make you really contented and happy.
I will move in the matter at once. ’Very truly, etc., Mark Twain, ’For
James W. N——, U. S. Senator.’</p>
<p>“That is the way you answered that letter. Those people say they will
hang me, if I ever enter that district again; and I am perfectly
satisfied they will, too.“</p>
<p>“Well, sir, I did not know I was doing any harm. I only wanted to
convince them.“</p>
<p>“Ah. Well, you did convince them, I make no manner of doubt. Now,
here is another specimen. I gave you a petition from certain gentlemen
of Nevada, praying that I would get a bill through Congress
incorporating the Methodist Episcopal Church of the State of Nevada. I
told you to say, in reply, that the creation of such a law came more
properly within the province of the state legislature; and to endeavor
to show them that, in the present feebleness of the religious element in
that new commonwealth, the expediency of incorporating the church was
questionable. What did you write?</p>
<p>“’WASHINGTON, Nov. 24.</p>
<p>“’Rev. John Halifax and others.</p>
<p>“‘GENTLEMEN: You will have to go to the state legislature about that
speculation of yours–Congress don’t know anything about religion. But
don’t you hurry to go there, either; because this thing you propose to
do out in that new country isn’t expedient–in fact, it is ridiculous.
Your religious people there are too feeble, in intellect, in morality,
in piety in everything, pretty much. You had better drop this–you can’t
make it work. You can’t issue stock on an incorporation like that–or if
you could, it would only keep you in trouble all the time. The other
denominations would abuse it, and “bear“ it, and “sell it short,“ and
break it down. They would do with it just as they would with one of your
silver-mines out there–they would try to make all the world believe it
was “wildcat.“ You ought not to do anything that is calculated to bring
a sacred thing into disrepute. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves
that is what I think about it. You close your petition with the words:
“And we will ever pray.“ I think you had better you need to do it.

<p>“That luminous epistle finishes me with the religious element among
my constituents. But that my political murder might be made sure, some
evil instinct prompted me to hand you this memorial from the grave
company of elders composing the board of aldermen of the city of San
Francisco, to try your hand upon a, memorial praying that the city’s
right to the water-lots upon the city front might be established by law
of Congress. I told you this was a dangerous matter to move in. I told
you to write a non-committal letter to the aldermen–an ambiguous
letter–a letter that should avoid, as far as possible, all real
consideration and discussion of the water-lot question. If there is any
feeling left in you–any shame–surely this letter you wrote, in obedience
to that order, ought to evoke it, when its words fall upon your
ears:</p>
<p>’WASHINGTON, Nov. 27</p>
<p>’The Honorable Board of Aldermen, etc.</p>
<p>’GENTLEMEN: George Washington, the revered Father of his Country, is
dead. His long and brilliant career is closed, alas! forever. He was
greatly respected in this section of the country, and his untimely
decease cast a gloom over the whole community. He died on the 14th day
of December, 1799. He passed peacefully away from the scene of his
honors and his great achievements, the most lamented hero and the best
beloved that ever earth hath yielded unto Death. At such a time as this,
you speak of water-lots! what a lot was his!</p>
<p>’What is fame! Fame is an accident. Sir Isaac Newton discovered an
apple falling to the ground–a trivial discovery, truly, and one which a
million men had made before him–but his parents were influential, and so
they tortured that small circumstance into something wonderful, and, lo!
the simple world took up the shout and, in almost the twinkling of an
eye, that man was famous. Treasure these thoughts.</p>

come now, let it be complete. Let it be complete–let this last of your
performances, which I am about to read, make a finality of it. I am a

Humboldt, asking that the post route from Indian Gulch to Shakespeare
Gap and intermediate points be changed partly to the old Mormon trail.
But I told you it was a delicate question, and warned you to deal with
it deftly–to answer it dubiously, and leave them a little in the dark.
And your fatal imbecility impelled you to make this disastrous reply. I
should think you would stop your ears, if you are not dead to all

succeed in some measure or otherwise, because the place where the route
leaves the Lassen Meadows, over beyond where those two Shawnee chiefs,
Dilapidated Vengeance and Biter-of-the-Clouds, were scalped last winter,
this being the favorite direction to some, but others preferring
something else in consequence of things, the Mormon trail leaving
Mosby’s at three in the morning, and passing through Jaw bone Flat to
Blucher, and then down by Jug-Handle, the road passing to the right of
it, and naturally leaving it on the right, too, and Dawson’s on the left
of the trail where it passes to the left of said Dawson’s and onward
thence to Tomahawk, thus making the route cheaper, easier of access to
all who can get at it, and compassing all the desirable objects so
considered by others, and, therefore, conferring the most good upon the
greatest number, and, consequently, I am encouraged to hope we shall.

information upon the subject, from time to time, as you may desire it
and the Post-office Department be enabled to furnish it to me. “’Very

enough.“</p>
<p>“Du–leave the house! I am a ruined man. Those Humboldt savages never
will forgive me for tangling their brains up with this inhuman letter. I

<p>I regarded that as a sort of covert intimation that my service could
be dispensed with, and so I resigned. I never will be a private
secretary to a senator again. You can’t please that kind of people. They
don’t know anything. They can’t appreciate a party’s efforts.</p>
<p>A FASHION ITEM–[Written about 1867.]</p>
<p>At General G—-’s reception the other night, the most fashionably
dressed lady was Mrs. G. C. She wore a pink satin dress, plain in front
but with a good deal of rake to it–to the train, I mean; it was said to
be two or three yards long. One could see it creeping along the floor
some little time after the woman was gone. Mrs. C. wore also a white
bodice, cut bias, with Pompadour sleeves, flounced with ruches; low
neck, with the inside handkerchief not visible, with white kid gloves.
She had on a pearl necklace, which glinted lonely, high up the midst of
that barren waste of neck and shoulders. Her hair was frizzled into a
tangled chaparral, forward of her ears, aft it was drawn together, and
compactly bound and plaited into a stump like a pony’s tail, and
furthermore was canted upward at a sharp angle, and ingeniously
supported by a red velvet crupper, whose forward extremity was made fast
with a half-hitch around a hairpin on the top of her head. Her whole top
hamper was neat and becoming. She had a beautiful complexion when she
first came, but it faded out by degrees in an unaccountable way.
However, it is not lost for good. I found the most of it on my shoulder
afterward. (I stood near the door when she squeezed out with the
throng.) There were other ladies present, but I only took notes of one
as a specimen. I would gladly enlarge upon the subject were I able to do
it justice.</p>
