<h4 id="general-washingtons-negro-body-servant">GENERAL WASHINGTON’S
NEGRO BODY-SERVANT</h4>
<p>A Biographical Sketch</p>
<p>The stirring part of this celebrated colored man’s life properly
began with his death–that is to say, the notable features of his
biography began with the first time he died. He had been little heard of
up to that time, but since then we have never ceased to hear of him; we
have never ceased to hear of him at stated, unfailing intervals. His was
a most remarkable career, and I have thought that its history would make
a valuable addition to our biographical literature. Therefore, I have
carefully collated the materials for such a work, from authentic
sources, and here present them to the public. I have rigidly excluded
from these pages everything of a doubtful character, with the object in
view of introducing my work into the schools for the instruction of the
youth of my country.</p>
<p>The name of the famous body-servant of General Washington was George.
After serving his illustrious master faithfully for half a century, and
enjoying throughout his long term his high regard and confidence, it
became his sorrowful duty at last to lay that beloved master to rest in
his peaceful grave by the Potomac. Ten years afterward –in 1809–full of
years and honors, he died himself, mourned by all who knew him. The
Boston GAZETTE of that date thus refers to the event:</p>
<p>George, the favorite body-servant of the lamented Washington, died in
Richmond, Va., last Tuesday, at the ripe age of 95 years. His intellect
was unimpaired, and his memory tenacious, up to within a few minutes of
his decease. He was present at the second installation of Washington as
President, and also at his funeral, and distinctly remembered all the
prominent incidents connected with those noted events.</p>
<p>From this period we hear no more of the favorite body-servant of
General Washington until May, 1825, at which time he died again. A
Philadelphia paper thus speaks of the sad occurrence:</p>
<p>At Macon, Ga., last week, a colored man named George, who was the
favorite body-servant of General Washington, died at the advanced age of
95 years. Up to within a few hours of his dissolution he was in full
possession of all his faculties, and could distinctly recollect the
second installation of Washington, his death and burial, the surrender
of Cornwallis, the battle of Trenton, the griefs and hardships of Valley
Forge, etc. Deceased was followed to the grave by the entire population
of Macon.</p>
<p>On the Fourth of July, 1830, and also of 1834 and 1836, the subject
of this sketch was exhibited in great state upon the rostrum of the
orator of the day, and in November of 1840 he died again. The St. Louis
REPUBLICAN of the 25th of that month spoke as follows:</p>
<p>“ANOTHER RELIC OF THE REVOLUTION GONE.“</p>
<p>“George, once the favorite body-servant of General Washington, died
yesterday at the house of Mr. John Leavenworth in this city, at the
venerable age of 95 years. He was in the full possession of his
faculties up to the hour of his death, and distinctly recollected the
first and second installations and death of President Washington, the
surrender of Cornwallis, the battles of Trenton and Monmouth, the
sufferings of the patriot army at Valley Forge, the proclamation of the
Declaration of Independence, the speech of Patrick Henry in the Virginia
House of Delegates, and many other old-time reminiscences of stirring
interest. Few white men die lamented as was this aged negro. The funeral
was very largely attended.“</p>
<p>During the next ten or eleven years the subject of this sketch
appeared at intervals at Fourth-of-July celebrations in various parts of
the country, and was exhibited upon the rostrum with flattering success.
But in the fall of 1855 he died again. The California papers thus speak
of the event:</p>
<p>ANOTHER OLD HERO GONE</p>
<p>Died, at Dutch Flat, on the 7th of March, George (once the
confidential body-servant of General Washington), at the great age of 95
years. His memory, which did not fail him till the last, was a wonderful
storehouse of interesting reminiscences. He could distinctly recollect
the first and second installations and death of President Washington,
the surrender of Cornwallis, the battles of Trenton and Monmouth, and
Bunker Hill, the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence, and
Braddock’s defeat. George was greatly respected in Dutch Flat, and it is
estimated that there were 10,000 people present at his funeral.</p>
<p>The last time the subject of this sketch died was in June, 1864; and
until we learn the contrary, it is just to presume that he died
permanently this time. The Michigan papers thus refer to the sorrowful
event:</p>
<p>ANOTHER CHERISHED REMNANT OF THE REVOLUTION GONE</p>
<p>George, a colored man, and once the favorite body-servant of George
Washington, died in Detroit last week, at the patriarchal age of 95
years. To the moment of his death his intellect was unclouded, and he
could distinctly remember the first and second installations and death
of Washington, the surrender of Cornwallis, the battles of Trenton and
Monmouth, and Bunker Hill, the proclamation of the Declaration of
Independence, Braddock’s defeat, the throwing over of the tea in Boston
harbor, and the landing of the Pilgrims. He died greatly respected, and
was followed to the grave by a vast concourse of people.</p>
<p>The faithful old servant is gone! We shall never see him more until
he turns up again. He has closed his long and splendid career of
dissolution, for the present, and sleeps peacefully, as only they sleep
who have earned their rest. He was in all respects a remarkable man. He
held his age better than any celebrity that has figured in history; and
the longer he lived the stronger and longer his memory grew. If he lives
to die again, he will distinctly recollect the discovery of America.</p>
<p>The above resume of his biography I believe to be substantially
correct, although it is possible that he may have died once or twice in
obscure places where the event failed of newspaper notoriety. One fault
I find in all the notices of his death I have quoted, and this ought to
be correct. In them he uniformly and impartially died at the age of 95.
This could not have been. He might have done that once, or maybe twice,
but he could not have continued it indefinitely. Allowing that when he
first died, he died at the age of 95, he was 151 years old when he died
last, in 1864. But his age did not keep pace with his recollections.
When he died the last time, he distinctly remembered the landing of the
Pilgrims, which took place in 1620. He must have been about twenty years
old when he witnessed that event, wherefore it is safe to assert that
the body-servant of General Washington was in the neighborhood of two
hundred and sixty or seventy years old when he departed this life
finally.</p>
<p>Having waited a proper length of time, to see if the subject of his
sketch had gone from us reliably and irrevocably, I now publish his
biography with confidence, and respectfully offer it to a mourning
nation.</p>
<p>P.S.–I see by the papers that this imfamous old fraud has just died
again, in Arkansas. This makes six times that he is known to have died,
and always in a new place. The death of Washington’s body-servant has
ceased to be a novelty; it’s charm is gone; the people are tired of it;
let it cease. This well-meaning but misguided negro has not put six
different communities to the expense of burying him in state, and has
swindled tens of thousands of people into following him to the grave
under the delusion that a select and peculiar distinction was being
conferred upon them. Let him stay buried for good now; and let that
newspaper suffer the severest censure that shall ever, in all the future
time, publish to the world that General Washington’s favorite colored
body-servant has died again.</p>
