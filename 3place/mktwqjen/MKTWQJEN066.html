<h4 id="chapter-v.">CHAPTER V.</h4>
<p>THE FRIGHTFUL CATASTROPHE.</p>
<p>The trial was at hand. All the great lords and barons of Brandenburgh
were assembled in the Hall of Justice in the ducal palace. No space was
left unoccupied where there was room for a spectator to stand or sit.
Conrad, clad in purple and ermine, sat in the premier’s chair, and on
either side sat the great judges of the realm. The old Duke had sternly
commanded that the trial of his daughter should proceed, without favor,
and then had taken to his bed broken-hearted. His days were numbered.
Poor Conrad had begged, as for his very life, that he might be spared
the misery of sitting in judgment upon his cousin’s crime, but it did
not avail.</p>
<p>The saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in Conrad’s
breast.</p>
<p>The gladdest was in his father’s. For, unknown to his daughter
“Conrad,“ the old Baron Klugenstein was come, and was among the crowd of
nobles, triumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house.</p>
<p>After the heralds had made due proclamation and the other
preliminaries had followed, the venerable Lord Chief justice said:</p>
<p>“Prisoner, stand forth!“</p>
<p>The unhappy princess rose and stood unveiled before the vast
multitude. The Lord Chief Justice continued:</p>
<p>“Most noble lady, before the great judges of this realm it hath been
charged and proven that out of holy wedlock your Grace hath given birth
unto a child; and by our ancient law the penalty is death, excepting in
one sole contingency, whereof his Grace the acting Duke, our good Lord
Conrad, will advertise you in his solemn sentence now; wherefore, give
heed.“</p>
<p>Conrad stretched forth the reluctant sceptre, and in the self-same
moment the womanly heart beneath his robe yearned pityingly toward the
doomed prisoner, and the tears came into his eyes. He opened his lips to
speak, but the Lord Chief Justice said quickly:</p>
<p>“Not there, your Grace, not there! It is not lawful to pronounce
judgment upon any of the ducal line SAVE FROM THE DUCAL THRONE!“</p>
<p>A shudder went to the heart of poor Conrad, and a tremor shook the
iron frame of his old father likewise. CONRAD HAD NOT BEEN CROWNED–dared
he profane the throne? He hesitated and turned pale with fear. But it
must be done. Wondering eyes were already upon him. They would be
suspicious eyes if he hesitated longer. He ascended the throne.
Presently he stretched forth the sceptre again, and said:</p>
<p>“Prisoner, in the name of our sovereign lord, Ulrich, Duke of
Brandenburgh, I proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon me.
Give heed to my words. By the ancient law of the land, except you
produce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner,
you must surely die. Embrace this opportunity–save yourself while yet
you may. Name the father of your child!“</p>
<p>A solemn hush fell upon the great court–a silence so profound that
men could hear their own hearts beat. Then the princess slowly turned,
with eyes gleaming with hate, and pointing her finger straight at
Conrad, said:</p>
<p>“Thou art the man!“</p>
<p>An appalling conviction of his helpless, hopeless peril struck a
chill to Conrad’s heart like the chill of death itself. What power on
earth could save him! To disprove the charge, he must reveal that he was
a woman; and for an uncrowned woman to sit in the ducal chair was death!
At one and the same moment, he and his grim old father swooned and fell
to, the ground.</p>
<p>[The remainder of this thrilling and eventful story will NOT be found
in this or any other publication, either now or at any future time.]</p>
<p>The truth is, I have got my hero (or heroine) into such a
particularly close place, that I do not see how I am ever going to get
him (or her) out of it again–and therefore I will wash my hands of the
whole business, and leave that person to get out the best way that
offers–or else stay there. I thought it was going to be easy enough to
straighten out that little difficulty, but it looks different now.</p>
<p>[If Harper’s Weekly or the New York Tribune desire to copy these
initial chapters into the, reading columns of their valuable journals,
just as they do the opening chapters of Ledger and New York Weekly
novels, they are at liberty to do so at the usual rates, provided they
“trust.“]</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN</p>
<p>End of A Burlesque Autobiography by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)</p>
<h2 id="roughing-it">ROUGHING IT</h2>
<p>by Mark Twain</p>
<p>1880</p>
<p>TO CALVIN H. HIGBIE, Of California, an Honest Man, a Genial Comrade,
and a Steadfast Friend. THIS BOOK IS INSCRIBED By the Author, In Memory
of the Curious Time When We Two WERE MILLIONAIRES FOR TEN DAYS.</p>
<h2 id="roughing-it-1">ROUGHING IT</h2>
<p>BY MARK TWAIN. (SAMUEL L. CLEMENS.)</p>
<p>PREFATORY.</p>
<p>This book is merely a personal narrative, and not a pretentious
history or a philosophical dissertation. It is a record of several years
of variegated vagabondizing, and its object is rather to help the
resting reader while away an idle hour than afflict him with
metaphysics, or goad him with science. Still, there is information in
the volume; information concerning an interesting episode in the history
of the Far West, about which no books have been written by persons who
were on the ground in person, and saw the happenings of the time with
their own eyes. I allude to the rise, growth and culmination of the
silver-mining fever in Nevada -a curious episode, in some respects; the
only one, of its peculiar kind, that has occurred in the land; and the
only one, indeed, that is likely to occur in it.</p>
<p>Yes, take it all around, there is quite a good deal of information in
the book. I regret this very much; but really it could not be helped:
information appears to stew out of me naturally, like the precious ottar
of roses out of the otter. Sometimes it has seemed to me that I would
give worlds if I could retain my facts; but it cannot be. The more I
calk up the sources, and the tighter I get, the more I leak wisdom.
Therefore, I can only claim indulgence at the hands of the reader, not
justification.</p>
