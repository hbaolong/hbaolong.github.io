<h4 id="about-magnanimous-incident-literature">ABOUT
MAGNANIMOUS-INCIDENT LITERATURE</h4>
<p>All my life, from boyhood up, I have had the habit of reading a
certain set of anecdotes, written in the quaint vein of The World’s
ingenious Fabulist, for the lesson they taught me and the pleasure they
gave me. They lay always convenient to my hand, and whenever I thought
meanly of my kind I turned to them, and they banished that sentiment;
whenever I felt myself to be selfish, sordid, and ignoble I turned to
them, and they told me what to do to win back my self-respect. Many
times I wished that the charming anecdotes had not stopped with their
happy climaxes, but had continued the pleasing history of the several
benefactors and beneficiaries. This wish rose in my breast so
persistently that at last I determined to satisfy it by seeking out the
sequels of those anecdotes myself. So I set about it, and after great
labor and tedious research accomplished my task. I will lay the result
before you, giving you each anecdote in its turn, and following it with
its sequel as I gathered it through my investigations.</p>
<p>THE GRATEFUL POODLE</p>
<p>One day a benevolent physician (who had read the books) having found
a stray poodle suffering from a broken leg, conveyed the poor creature
to his home, and after setting and bandaging the injured limb gave the
little outcast its liberty again, and thought no more about the matter.
But how great was his surprise, upon opening his door one morning, some
days later, to find the grateful poodle patiently waiting there, and in
its company another stray dog, one of whose legs, by some accident, had
been broken. The kind physician at once relieved the distressed animal,
nor did he forget to admire the inscrutable goodness and mercy of God,
who had been willing to use so humble an instrument as the poor outcast
poodle for the inculcating of, etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>SEQUEL</p>
<p>The next morning the benevolent physician found the two dogs, beaming
with gratitude, waiting at his door, and with them two other
dogs-cripples. The cripples were speedily healed, and the four went
their way, leaving the benevolent physician more overcome by pious
wonder than ever. The day passed, the morning came. There at the door
sat now the four reconstructed dogs, and with them four others requiring
reconstruction. This day also passed, and another morning came; and now
sixteen dogs, eight of them newly crippled, occupied the sidewalk, and
the people were going around. By noon the broken legs were all set, but
the pious wonder in the good physician’s breast was beginning to get
mixed with involuntary profanity. The sun rose once more, and exhibited
thirty-two dogs, sixteen of them with broken legs, occupying the
sidewalk and half of the street; the human spectators took up the rest
of the room. The cries of the wounded, the songs of the healed brutes,
and the comments of the onlooking citizens made great and inspiring
cheer, but traffic was interrupted in that street. The good physician
hired a couple of assistant surgeons and got through his benevolent work
before dark, first taking the precaution to cancel his
church-membership, so that he might express himself with the latitude
which the case required.</p>
<p>But some things have their limits. When once more the morning dawned,
and the good physician looked out upon a massed and far-reaching
multitude of clamorous and beseeching dogs, he said, “I might as well
acknowledge it, I have been fooled by the books; they only tell the
pretty part of the story, and then stop. Fetch me the shotgun; this
thing has gone along far enough.“</p>
<p>He issued forth with his weapon, and chanced to step upon the tail of
the original poodle, who promptly bit him in the leg. Now the great and
good work which this poodle had been engaged in had engendered in him
such a mighty and augmenting enthusiasm as to turn his weak head at last
and drive him mad. A month later, when the benevolent physician lay in
the death-throes of hydrophobia, he called his weeping friends about
him, and said:</p>
<p>“Beware of the books. They tell but half of the story. Whenever a
poor wretch asks you for help, and you feel a doubt as to what result
may flow from your benevolence, give yourself the benefit of the doubt
and kill the applicant.“</p>
<p>And so saying he turned his face to the wall and gave up the
ghost.</p>
<p>THE BENEVOLENT AUTHOR</p>
<p>A poor and young literary beginner had tried in vain to get his
manuscripts accepted. At last, when the horrors of starvation were
staring him in the face, he laid his sad case before a celebrated
author, beseeching his counsel and assistance. This generous man
immediately put aside his own matters and proceeded to peruse one of the
despised manuscripts. Having completed his kindly task, he shook the
poor young man cordially by the hand, saying, “I perceive merit in this;
come again to me on Monday.“ At the time specified, the celebrated
author, with a sweet smile, but saying nothing, spread open a magazine
which was damp from the press. What was the poor young man’s
astonishment to discover upon the printed page his own article. “How can
I ever,“ said he, falling upon his knees and bursting into tears,
“testify my gratitude for this noble conduct!“</p>
<p>The celebrated author was the renowned Snodgrass; the poor young
beginner thus rescued from obscurity and starvation was the afterward
equally renowned Snagsby. Let this pleasing incident admonish us to turn
a charitable ear to all beginners that need help.</p>
<p>SEQUEL</p>
<p>The next week Snagsby was back with five rejected manuscripts. The
celebrated author was a little surprised, because in the books the young
struggler had needed but one lift, apparently. However, he plowed
through these papers, removing unnecessary flowers and digging up some
acres of adjective stumps, and then succeeded in getting two of the
articles accepted.</p>
<p>A week or so drifted by, and the grateful Snagsby arrived with
another cargo. The celebrated author had felt a mighty glow of
satisfaction within himself the first time he had successfully
befriended the poor young struggler, and had compared himself with the
generous people in the books with high gratification; but he was
beginning to suspect now that he had struck upon something fresh in the
noble-episode line. His enthusiasm took a chill. Still, he could not
bear to repulse this struggling young author, who clung to him with such
pretty simplicity and trustfulness.</p>
<p>Well, the upshot of it all was that the celebrated author presently
found himself permanently freighted with the poor young beginner. All
his mild efforts to unload this cargo went for nothing. He had to give
daily counsel, daily encouragement; he had to keep on procuring magazine
acceptances, and then revamping the manuscripts to make them
presentable. When the young aspirant got a start at last, he rode into
sudden fame by describing the celebrated author’s private life with such
a caustic humor and such minuteness of blistering detail that the book
sold a prodigious edition, and broke the celebrated author’s heart with
mortification. With his latest gasp he said, “Alas, the books deceived
me; they do not tell the whole story. Beware of the struggling young
author, my friends. Whom God sees fit to starve, let not man
presumptuously rescue to his own undoing.“</p>
<p>THE GRATEFUL HUSBAND</p>
<p>One day a lady was driving through the principal street of a great
city with her little boy, when the horses took fright and dashed madly
away, hurling the coachman from his box and leaving the occupants of the
carnage paralyzed with terror. But a brave youth who was driving a
grocery-wagon threw himself before the plunging animals, and succeeded
in arresting their flight at the peril of his own.–[This is probably a
misprint.–M. T.]–The grateful lady took his number, and upon arriving at
her home she related the heroic act to her husband (who had read the
books), who listened with streaming eyes to the moving recital, and who,
after returning thanks, in conjunction with his restored loved ones, to
Him who suffereth not even a sparrow to fall to the ground unnoticed,
sent for the brave young person, and, placing a check for five hundred
dollars in his hand, said, “Take this as a reward for your noble act,
William Ferguson, and if ever you shall need a friend, remember that
Thompson McSpadden has a grateful heart.“ Let us learn from this that a
good deed cannot fail to benefit the doer, however humble he may be.</p>
<p>SEQUEL</p>
<p>William Ferguson called the next week and asked Mr. McSpadden to use
his influence to get him a higher employment, he feeling capable of
better things than driving a grocer’s wagon. Mr. McSpadden got him an
underclerkship at a good salary.</p>
<p>Presently William Ferguson’s mother fell sick, and William–Well, to
cut the story short, Mr. McSpadden consented to take her into his house.
Before long she yearned for the society of her younger children; so Mary
and Julia were admitted also, and little Jimmy, their brother. Jimmy had
a pocket knife, and he wandered into the drawing-room with it one day,
alone, and reduced ten thousand dollars’ worth of furniture to an
indeterminable value in rather less than three-quarters of an hour. A
day or two later he fell down-stairs and broke his neck, and seventeen
of his family’s relatives came to the house to attend the funeral. This
made them acquainted, and they kept the kitchen occupied after that, and
likewise kept the McSpaddens busy hunting-up situations of various sorts
for them, and hunting up more when they wore these out. The old woman
drank a good deal and swore a good deal; but the grateful McSpaddens
knew it was their duty to reform her, considering what her son had done
for them, so they clave nobly to their generous task. William came often
and got decreasing sums of money, and asked for higher and more
lucrative employments–which the grateful McSpadden more or less promptly
procured for him. McSpadden consented also, after some demur, to fit
William for college; but when the first vacation came and the hero
requested to be sent to Europe for his health, the persecuted McSpadden
rose against the tyrant and revolted. He plainly and squarely refused.
William Ferguson’s mother was so astounded that she let her gin-bottle
drop, and her profane lips refused to do their office. When she
recovered she said in a half-gasp, “Is this your gratitude? Where would
your wife and boy be now, but for my son?“</p>
<p>William said, “Is this your gratitude? Did I save your wife’s life or
not? Tell me that!“</p>
<p>Seven relations swarmed in from the kitchen and each said, “And this
is his gratitude!“</p>
<p>William’s sisters stared, bewildered, and said, “And this is his
grat–“ but were interrupted by their mother, who burst into tears and
exclaimed,</p>
<p>“To think that my sainted little Jimmy threw away his life in the
service of such a reptile!“</p>
<p>Then the pluck of the revolutionary McSpadden rose to the occasion,
and he replied with fervor, “Out of my house, the whole beggarly tribe
of you! I was beguiled by the books, but shall never be beguiled again
–once is sufficient for me.“ And turning to William he shouted, “Yes,
you did save my, wife’s life, and the next man that does it shall die in
his tracks!“</p>
<p>Not being a clergyman, I place my text at the end of my sermon
instead of at the beginning. Here it is, from Mr. Noah Brooks’s
Recollections of President Lincoln in Scribners Monthly:</p>
<p>J. H. Hackett, in his part of Falstaff, was an actor who gave
Mr. Lincoln great delight. With his usual desire to signify to others
his sense of obligation, Mr. Lincoln wrote a genial little note to the
actor expressing his pleasure at witnessing his performance.
Mr. Hackett, in reply, sent a book of some sort; perhaps it was one of
his own authorship. He also wrote several notes to the President. One
night, quite late, when the episode had passed out of my mind, I went to
the white House in answer to a message. Passing into the President’s
office, I noticed, to my surprise, Hackett sitting in the anteroom as if
waiting for an audience. The President asked me if any one was outside.
On being told, he said, half sadly, “Oh, I can’t see him, I can’t see
him; I was in hopes he had gone away.“ Then he added, “Now this just
illustrates the difficulty of having pleasant friends and acquaintances
in this place. You know how I liked Hackett as an actor, and how I wrote
to tell him so. He sent me that book, and there I thought the matter
would end. He is a master of his place in the profession, I suppose, and
well fixed in it; but just because we had a little friendly
correspondence, such as any two men might have, he wants something. What
do you suppose he wants?“ I could not guess, and Mr. Lincoln added,
“well, he wants to be consul to London. Oh, dear!“</p>
<p>I will observe, in conclusion, that the William Ferguson incident
occurred, and within my personal knowledge–though I have changed the
nature of the details, to keep William from recognizing himself in
it.</p>
<p>All the readers of this article have in some sweet and gushing hour
of their lives played the role of Magnanimous-Incident hero. I wish I
knew how many there are among them who are willing to talk about that
episode and like to be reminded of the consequences that flowed from
it.</p>
