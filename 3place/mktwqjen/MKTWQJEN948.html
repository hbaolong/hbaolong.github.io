OF 1910. LAST TRIP TO BERMUDA. LETTERS TO PAINE. THE LAST LETTER</h4>
<p>Mark Twain had returned from a month’s trip to Bermuda a few days
before Jean died. Now, by his physician’s advice, he went back to those
balmy islands. He had always loved them, since his first trip there with
Twichell thirty-three years earlier, and at “Bay House,“ the residence
of Vice-Consul Allen, where he was always a welcome guest, he could have
the attentions and care and comforts of a home. Taking Claude, the
butler, as his valet, he sailed January 5th, and presently sent back a
letter in which he said, “Again I am leading the ideal life, and am
immeasurably content.“</p>
<p>By his wish, the present writer and his family were keeping the
Stormfield house open for him, in order that he might be able to return
to its comforts at any time. He sent frequent letters–one or two by each
steamer–but as a rule they did not concern matters of general interest.
A little after his arrival, however, he wrote concerning an incident of
his former visit–a trivial matter–but one which had annoyed him. I had
been with him in Bermuda on the earlier visit, and as I remember it,
there had been some slight oversight on his part in the matter of
official etiquette–something which doubtless no one had noticed but
himself.</p>
<p>To A. B. Paine, in Redding:</p>
<p>BAY HOUSE, Jan. 11, 1910.</p>
<p>DEAR PAINE,–. . . There was a military lecture last night at the
Officer’s Mess, prospect, and as the lecturer honored me with a special
and urgent invitation and said he wanted to lecture to me particularly,
I being “the greatest living master of the platform-art,“ I naturally
packed Helen and her mother into the provided carriage and went.</p>
<p>As soon as we landed at the door with the crowd the Governor came to
me at once and was very cordial, and apparently as glad to see me as he
said he was. So that incident is closed. And pleasantly and entirely
satisfactorily. Everything is all right, now, and I am no longer in a
clumsy and awkward situation.</p>
<p>I “met up“ with that charming Colonel Chapman, and other officers of
the regiment, and had a good time.</p>
<p>Commandant Peters of the “Carnegie“ will dine here tonight and
arrange a private visit for us to his ship, the crowd to be denied
access. Sincerely Yours, S. L. C.</p>
<p>“Helen“ of this letter was Mr. and Mrs. Allen’s young daughter, a
favorite companion of his walks and drives. “Loomis“ and “Lark,“
mentioned in the letters which follow, were Edward E. Loomis–his nephew
by marriage–named by Mark Twain as one of the trustees of his estate,
and Charles T. Lark, Mark Twain’s attorney.</p>
<p>To A. B. Paine, in Redding:</p>
<p>HAMILTON, Jan. 21, ’10. DEAR PAINE,–Thanks for your letter, and for
its contenting news of the situation in that foreign and far-off and
vaguely-remembered country where you and Loomis and Lark and other
beloved friends are.</p>
<p>I have a letter from Clara this morning. She is solicitous, and wants
me well and watchfully taken care of. My, she ought to see Helen and her
parents and Claude administer that trust!</p>
<p>Also she says: “I hope to hear from you or Mr. Paine very soon.“</p>
<p>I am writing her, and I know you will respond to your part of her
prayer. She is pretty desolate now, after Jean’s emancipation–the only
kindness God ever did that poor unoffending child in all her hard life.
Ys ever S. L. C.</p>
<p>Send Clara a copy of Howells’s gorgeous letter. I want a copy of my
article that he is speaking of.</p>
<p>The “gorgeous letter“ was concerning Mark Twain’s article, “The
Turning-point in My Life“ which had just appeared in one of the Harper
publications. Howells wrote of it, “While your wonderful words are warm
in my mind yet, I want to tell you what you know already: that you never
wrote anything greater, finer, than that turning-point paper of
yours.“</p>
<p>From the early Bermuda letters we may gather that Mark Twain’s days
were enjoyable enough, and that his malady was not giving him serious
trouble, thus far. Near the end of January he wrote: “Life continues
here the same as usual. There isn’t a flaw in it. Good times, good home,
tranquil contentment all day and every day, without a break. I shouldn’t
know how to go about bettering my situation.“ He did little in the way
of literary work, probably finding neither time nor inclination for it.
When he wrote at all it was merely to set down some fanciful drolleries
with no thought of publication.</p>
<p>To Prof. William Lyon Phelps, Yale College:</p>
<p>HAMILTON, March 12. DEAR PROFESSOR PHELPS,–I thank you ever so much
for the book–[Professor Phelps’s Essays on Modern Novelists.]–which I
find charming–so charming indeed, that I read it through in a single
night, and did not regret the lost night’s sleep. I am glad if I deserve
what you have said about me: and even if I don’t I am proud and well
contented, since you think I deserve it.</p>
<p>Yes, I saw Prof. Lounsbury, and had a most pleasant time with him. He
ought to have staid longer in this little paradise–partly for his own
sake, but mainly for mine.</p>
<p>I knew my poor Jean had written you. I shall not have so dear and
sweet a secretary again.</p>
<p>Good health to you, and all good fortune attend you. Sincerely yours,
S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>He would appear to have written not many letters besides those to
Mrs. Gabrilowitsch and to Stormfield, but when a little girl sent him a
report of a dream, inspired by reading The Prince and the Pauper, he
took the time and trouble to acknowledge it, realizing, no doubt, that a
line from him would give the child happiness.</p>
<p>To Miss Sulamith, in New York:</p>
<p>“BAY HOUSE,“ BERMUDA, March 21, 1910. DEAR MISS SULAMITH,–I think it
is a remarkable dream for a girl of 13 to have dreamed, in fact for a
person of any age to have dreamed, because it moves by regular grade and
sequence from the beginning to the end, which is not the habit of
dreams. I think your report of it is a good piece of work, a clear and
effective statement of the vision.</p>
<p>I am glad to know you like the “Prince and the Pauper“ so well and I
believe with you that the dream is good evidence of that liking. I think
I may say, with your sister that I like myself best when I am serious.
Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Through February, and most of March, letters and reports from him
were about the same. He had begun to plan for his return, and concerning
amusements at Stormfield for the entertainment of the neighbors, and for
the benefit of the library which he had founded soon after his arrival
in Redding. In these letters he seldom mentioned the angina pains that
had tortured him earlier. But once, when he sent a small photograph of
himself, it seemed to us that his face had become thin and that he had
suffered. Certainly his next letter was not reassuring.</p>
<p>To A. B. Paine, in Redding:</p>
<p>DEAR PAINE,–We must look into the magic-lantern business. Maybe the
modern lantern is too elaborate and troublesome for back-settlement use,
but we can inquire. We must have some kind of a show at “Stormfield“ to
entertain the countryside with.</p>
<p>We are booked to sail in the “Bermudian“ April 23rd, but don’t tell
anybody, I don’t want it known. I may have to go sooner if the pain in
my breast doesn’t mend its ways pretty considerably. I don’t want to die
here for this is an unkind place for a person in that condition. I
should have to lie in the undertaker’s cellar until the ship would
remove me and it is dark down there and unpleasant.</p>
<p>The Colliers will meet me on the pier and I may stay with them a week
or two before going home. It all depends on the breast pain–I don’t want
to die there. I am growing more and more particular about the place.
With love, S. L. C.</p>
<p>This letter had been written by the hand of his “secretary,“ Helen
Allen: writing had become an effort to him. Yet we did not suspect how
rapidly the end was approaching and only grew vaguely alarmed. A week
later, however, it became evident that his condition was critical.</p>
<p>DEAR PAINE,–. . . . I have been having a most uncomfortable time for
the past 4 days with that breast-pain, which turns out to be an
affection of the heart, just as I originally suspected. The news from
New York is to the effect that non-bronchial weather has arrived there
at last, therefore if I can get my breast trouble in traveling condition
I may sail for home a week or two earlier than has heretofore been
proposed: Yours as ever S. L. CLEMENS, (per H. S. A.)</p>
<p>In this letter he seems to have forgotten that his trouble had been
pronounced an affection of the heart long before he left America, though
at first it had been thought that it might be gastritis. The same mail
brought a letter from Mr. Allen explaining fully the seriousness of his
condition. I sailed immediately for Bermuda, arriving there on the 4th
of April. He was not suffering at the moment, though the pains came now
with alarming frequency and violence. He was cheerful and brave. He did
not complain. He gave no suggestion of a man whose days were nearly
ended.</p>
<p>A part of the Stormfield estate had been a farm, which he had given
to Jean Clemens, where she had busied herself raising some live stock
and poultry. After her death he had wished the place to be sold and the
returns devoted to some memorial purpose. The sale had been made during
the winter and the price received had been paid in cash. I found him
full of interest in all affairs, and anxious to discuss the memorial
plan. A day or two later he dictated the following letter-the last he
would ever send.</p>
<p>It seemed fitting that this final word from one who had so long given
happiness to the whole world should record a special gift to his
neighbors.</p>
<p>To Charles T. Lark, in New York:</p>
<p>HAMILTON, BERMUDA. April 6, 1910. DEAR MR. LARK,–I have told Paine
that I want the money derived from the sale of the farm, which I had
given, but not conveyed, to my daughter Jean, to be used to erect a
building for the Mark Twain Library of Redding, the building to be
called the Jean L. Clemens Memorial Building.</p>
<p>I wish to place the money ,000.00 in the hands of three trustees,
–Paine and two others: H. A. Lounsbury and William E. Hazen, all of
Redding, these trustees to form a building Committee to decide on the
size and plan of the building needed and to arrange for and supervise
the work in such a manner that the fund shall amply provide for the
building complete, with necessary furnishings, leaving, if possible, a
balance remaining, sufficient for such repairs and additional
furnishings as may be required for two years from the time of
completion.</p>
<p>Will you please draw a document covering these requirements and have
it ready by the time I reach New York (April 14th). Very sincerely, S.
L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>We sailed on the 12th of April, reaching New York on the 14th, as he
had planned. A day or two later, Mr. and Mrs. Gabrilowitsch, summoned
from Italy by cable, arrived. He suffered very little after reaching
Stormfield, and his mind was comparatively clear up to the last day. On
the afternoon of April 21st he sank into a state of coma, and just at
sunset he died. Three days later, at Elmira, New York, he was laid
beside Mrs. Clemens and those others who had preceded him.</p>
<p>THE LAST DAY AT STORMFIELD</p>
<p>By BLISS CARMAN.</p>
<p>At Redding, Connecticut, The April sunrise pours Over the hardwood
ridges Softening and greening now In the first magic of Spring.</p>
<p>The wild cherry-trees are in bloom, The bloodroot is white underfoot,
The serene early light flows on, Touching with glory the world, And
flooding the large upper room Where a sick man sleeps. Slowly he opens
his eyes, After long weariness, smiles, And stretches arms overhead,
While those about him take heart.</p>
<p>With his awakening strength, (Morning and spring in the air, The
strong clean scents of earth, The call of the golden shaft, Ringing
across the hills) He takes up his heartening book, Opens the volume and
reads, A page of old rugged Carlyle, The dour philosopher Who looked
askance upon life, Lurid, ironical, grim, Yet sound at the core. But
weariness returns; He lays the book aside With his glasses upon the bed,
And gladly sleeps. Sleep, Blessed abundant sleep, Is all that he
needs.</p>
<p>And when the close of day Reddens upon the hills And washes the room
with rose, In the twilight hush The Summoner comes to him Ever so
gently, unseen, Touches him on the shoulder; And with the departing sun
Our great funning friend is gone.</p>
<p>How he has made us laugh! A whole generation of men Smiled in the joy
of his wit. But who knows whether he was not Like those deep jesters of
old Who dwelt at the courts of Kings, Arthur’s, Pendragon’s, Lear’s,
Plying the wise fool’s trade, Making men merry at will, Hiding their
deeper thoughts Under a motley array,– Keen-eyed, serious men, Watching
the sorry world, The gaudy pageant of life, With pity and wisdom and
love?</p>
<p>Fearless, extravagant, wild, His caustic merciless mirth Was leveled
at pompous shams. Doubt not behind that mask There dwelt the soul of a
man, Resolute, sorrowing, sage, As sure a champion of good As ever rode
forth to fray.</p>
<p>Haply–who knows?–somewhere In Avalon, Isle of Dreams, In vast
contentment at last, With every grief done away, While Chaucer and
Shakespeare wait, And Moliere hangs on his words, And Cervantes not far
off Listens and smiles apart, With that incomparable drawl He is jesting
with Dagonet now.</p>
