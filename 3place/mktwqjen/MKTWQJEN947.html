1909. TO HOWELLS AND OTHERS. LIFE AT STORMFIELD. COPYRIGHT EXTENSION.
DEATH OF JEAN CLEMENS</h4>
<p>Clemens remained at Stormfield all that winter. New York was sixty
miles away and he did not often care to make the journey. He was
constantly invited to this or that public gathering, or private party,
but such affairs had lost interest for him. He preferred the quiet of
his luxurious home with its beautiful outlook, while for entertainment
he found the billiard afternoons sufficient. Guests came from the city,
now and again, for week-end visits, and if he ever was restless or
lonely he did not show it.</p>
<p>Among the invitations that came was one from General O. O. Howard
asking him to preside at a meeting to raise an endowment fund for a
Lincoln Memorial University at Cumberland Gap, Tennessee. Closing his
letter, General Howard said, “Never mind if you did fight on the other
side.“</p>
<p>To General O. O. Howard:</p>
<p>STORMFIELD, REDDING, CONNECTICUT, Jan, 12, ’09. DEAR GENERAL
HOWARD,–You pay me a most gratifying compliment in asking me to preside,
and it causes me very real regret that I am obliged to decline, for the
object of the meeting appeals strongly to me, since that object is to
aid in raising the 00,000 Endowment Fund for Lincoln Memorial
University. The Endowment Fund will be the most fitting of all the
memorials the country will dedicate to the memory of Lincoln, serving,
as it will, to uplift his very own people.</p>
<p>I hope you will meet with complete success, and I am sorry I cannot
be there to witness it and help you rejoice. But I am older than people
think, and besides I live away out in the country and never stir from
home, except at geological intervals, to fill left-over engagements in
mesozoic times when I was younger and indiscreeter.</p>
<p>You ought not to say sarcastic things about my “fighting on the other
side.“ General Grant did not act like that. General Grant paid me
compliments. He bracketed me with Zenophon–it is there in his Memoirs
for anybody to read. He said if all the confederate soldiers had
followed my example and adopted my military arts he could never have
caught enough of them in a bunch to inconvenience the Rebellion. General
Grant was a fair man, and recognized my worth; but you are prejudiced,
and you have hurt my feelings. But I have an affection for you, anyway.
MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>One of Mark Twain’s friends was Henniker-Heaton, the so-called
“Father of Penny Postage“ between England and America. When, after long
years of effort, he succeeded in getting the rate established, he at
once bent his energies in the direction of cheap cable service and a
letter from him came one day to Stormfield concerning his new plans.
This letter happened to be over-weight, which gave Mark Twain a chance
for some amusing exaggerations at his expense.</p>
<p>To Henniker-Heaton, in London:</p>
<p>STORMFIELD, REDDING, CONNECTICUT, Jan. 18, 1909. DEAR
HENNIKER-HEATON,–I do hope you will succeed to your heart’s desire in
your cheap-cablegram campaign, and I feel sure you will. Indeed your
cheap-postage victory, achieved in spite of a quarter-century of
determined opposition, is good and rational prophecy that you will.
Wireless, not being as yet imprisoned in a Chinese wall of private cash
and high-placed and formidable influence, will come to your aid and make
your new campaign briefer and easier than the other one was.</p>
<p>Now then, after uttering my serious word, am I privileged to be
frivolous for a moment? When you shall have achieved cheap telegraphy,
are you going to employ it for just your own selfish profit and other
people’s pecuniary damage, the way you are doing with your cheap
postage? You get letter-postage reduced to 2 cents an ounce, then you
mail me a 4-ounce letter with a 2-cent stamp on it, and I have to pay
the extra freight at this end of the line. I return your envelope for
inspection. Look at it. Stamped in one place is a vast “T,“ and under it
the figures “40,“ and under those figures appears an “L,“ a sinister and
suspicious and mysterious L. In another place, stamped within a circle,
in offensively large capitals, you find the words “DUE 8 CENTS.“
Finally, in the midst of a desert space up nor-noreastard from that
circle you find a figure “3“ of quite unnecessarily aggressive and
insolent magnitude–and done with a blue pencil, so as to be as
conspicuous as possible. I inquired about these strange signs and
symbols of the postman. He said they were P. O. Department signals for
his instruction.</p>
<p>“Instruction for what?“</p>
<p>“To get extra postage.“</p>
<p>“Is it so? Explain. Tell me about the large T and the 40.</p>
<p>“It’s short for Take 40–or as we postmen say, grab 40“</p>
<p>Go on, please, while I think up some words to swear with.“</p>
<p>“Due 8 means, grab 8 more.“</p>
<p>“Continue.“</p>
<p>“The blue-pencil 3 was an afterthought. There aren’t any stamps for
afterthoughts; the sums vary, according to inspiration, and they whirl
in the one that suggests itself at the last moment. Sometimes they go
several times higher than this one. This one only means hog 3 cents
more. And so if you’ve got 51 cents about you, or can borrow it–“</p>
<p>“Tell me: who gets this corruption?“</p>
<p>“Half of it goes to the man in England who ships the letter on short
postage, and the other half goes to the P.O.D. to protect cheap postage
from inaugurating a deficit.“</p>
<p>“——————-“</p>
<p>“I can’t blame you; I would say it myself in your place, if these
ladies were not present. But you see I’m only obeying orders, I can’t
help myself.“</p>
<p>“Oh, I know it; I’m not blaming you. Finally, what does that L stand
for?“</p>
<p>“Get the money, or give him L. It’s English, you know.“</p>
<p>“Take it and go. It’s the last cent I’ve got in the world–.“</p>
<p>After seeing the Oxford pageant file by the grand stand, picture
after picture, splendor after splendor, three thousand five hundred
strong, the most moving and beautiful and impressive and
historically-instructive show conceivable, you are not to think I would
miss the London pageant of next year, with its shining host of 15,000
historical English men and women dug from the misty books of all the
vanished ages and marching in the light of the sun–all alive, and
looking just as they were used to look! Mr. Lascelles spent yesterday
here on the farm, and told me all about it. I shall be in the middle of
my 75th year then, and interested in pageants for personal and
prospective reasons.</p>
<p>I beg you to give my best thanks to the Bath Club for the offer of
its hospitalities, but I shall not be able to take advantage of it,
because I am to be a guest in a private house during my stay in London.
Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>It was in 1907 that Clemens had seen the Oxford Pageant–during the
week when he had been awarded his doctor’s degree. It gave him the
greatest delight, and he fully expected to see the next one, planned for
1910.</p>
<p>In the letter to Howells which follows we get another glimpse of Mark
Twain’s philosophy of man, the irresponsible machine.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in New York:</p>
<p>STORMFIELD, REDDING, CONN., Jan. 18, ’09. DEAR HOWELLS,–I have to
write a line, lazy as I am, to say how your Poe article delighted me;
and to say that I am in agreement with substantially all you say about
his literature. To me his prose is unreadable–like Jane Austin’s. No,
there is a difference. I could read his prose on salary, but not Jane’s.
Jane is entirely impossible. It seems a great pity that they allowed her
to die a natural death.</p>
<p>Another thing: you grant that God and circumstances sinned against
Poe, but you also grant that he sinned against himself–a thing which he
couldn’t do and didn’t do.</p>
<p>It is lively up here now. I wish you could come. Yrs ever, MARK</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in New York:</p>
<p>STORMFIELD, REDDING, CONNECTICUT, 3 in the morning, Apl. 17, ’09.
[Written with pencil]. My pen has gone dry and the ink is out of reach.
Howells, Did you write me day-before-day before yesterday, or did I
dream it? In my mind’s eye I most vividly see your hand-write on a
square blue envelop in the mailpile. I have hunted the house over, but
there is no such letter. Was it an illusion?</p>
<p>I am reading Lowell’s letter, and smoking. I woke an hour ago and am
reading to keep from wasting the time. On page 305, vol. I. I have just
margined a note:</p>
<p>“Young friend! I like that! You ought to see him now.“</p>
<p>It seemed startlingly strange to hear a person call you young. It was
a brick out of a blue sky, and knocked me groggy for a moment. Ah me,
the pathos of it is, that we were young then. And he–why, so was he, but
he didn’t know it. He didn’t even know it 9 years later, when we saw him
approaching and you warned me, saying, “Don’t say anything about age–he
has just turned fifty, and thinks he is old and broods over it.“</p>
<p>[Well, Clara did sing! And you wrote her a dear letter.]</p>
<p>Time to go to sleep. Yours ever, MARK.</p>
<p>To Daniel Kiefer:</p>
<p>[No date.] DANL KIEFER ESQ. DEAR SIR,–I should be far from willing to
have a political party named after me.</p>
<p>I would not be willing to belong to a party which allowed its members
to have political aspirations or to push friends forward for political
preferment. Yours very truly, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The copyright extension, for which the author had been working so
long, was granted by Congress in 1909, largely as the result of that
afternoon in Washington when Mark Twain had “received“ in “Uncle Joe“
Cannon’s private room, and preached the gospel of copyright until the
daylight faded and the rest of the Capitol grew still. Champ Clark was
the last to linger that day and they had talked far into the dusk. Clark
was powerful, and had fathered the bill. Now he wrote to know if it was
satisfactory.</p>
<p>To Champ Clark, in Washington:</p>
<p>STORMFIELD, REDDING, CONN., June 5, ’09. DEAR CHAMP CLARK–Is the new
copyright law acceptable to me? Emphatically, yes! Clark, it is the only
sane, and clearly defined, and just and righteous copyright law that has
ever existed in the United States. Whosoever will compare it with its
predecessors will have no trouble in arriving at that decision.</p>
<p>The bill which was before the committee two years ago when I was down
there was the most stupefying jumble of conflicting and apparently
irreconcilable interests that was ever seen; and we all said “the case
is hopeless, absolutely hopeless–out of this chaos nothing can be
built.“ But we were in error; out of that chaotic mass this excellent
bill has been instructed; the warring interests have been reconciled,
and the result is as comely and substantial a legislative edifice as
lifts its domes and towers and protective lightning rods out of the
statute book, I think. When I think of that other bill, which even the
Deity couldn’t understand, and of this one which even I can understand,
I take off my hat to the man or men who devised this one. Was it R. U.
Johnson? Was it the Author’s League? Was it both together? I don’t know,
but I take off my hat, anyway. Johnson has written a valuable article
about the new law–I enclose it.</p>
<p>At last–at last and for the first time in copyright history we are
ahead of England! Ahead of her in two ways: by length of time and by
fairness to all interests concerned. Does this sound like shouting? Then
I must modify it: all we possessed of copyright-justice before the
fourth of last March we owed to England’s initiative. Truly Yours, S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Because Mark Twain amused himself with certain aspects of Christian
Science, and was critical of Mrs. Eddy, there grew up a wide impression
that he jeered at the theory of mental healing; when, as a matter of
fact, he was one of its earliest converts, and never lost faith in its
power. The letter which follows is an excellent exposition of his
attitude toward the institution of Christian Science and the founder of
the church in America.</p>
<p>To J. Wylie Smith, Glasgow, Scotland:</p>
<p>“STORMFIELD,“ August 7, 1909 DEAR SIR,–My view of the matter has not
changed. To wit, that Christian Science is valuable; that it has just
the same value now that it had when Mrs. Eddy stole it from Quimby; that
its healing principle (its most valuable asset) possesses the same force
now that it possessed a million years ago before Quimby was born; that
Mrs. Eddy. . . organized that force, and is entitled to high credit for
that. Then, with a splendid sagacity she hitched it to. . . a religion,
the surest of all ways to secure friends for it, and support. In a fine
and lofty way –figuratively speaking–it was a tramp stealing a ride on
the lightning express. Ah, how did that ignorant village-born peasant
woman know the human being so well? She has no more intellect than a
tadpole–until it comes to business then she is a marvel! Am I sorry I
wrote the book? Most certainly not. You say you have 500 (converts) in
Glasgow. Fifty years from now, your posterity will not count them by the
hundred, but by the thousand. I feel absolutely sure of this. Very truly
yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Clemens wrote very little for publication that year, but he enjoyed
writing for his own amusement, setting down the things that boiled, or
bubbled, within him: mainly chapters on the inconsistencies of human
deportment, human superstition and human creeds. The “Letters from the
Earth“ referred to in the following, were supposed to have been written
by an immortal visitant from some far realm to a friend, describing the
absurdities of mankind. It is true, as he said, that they would not do
for publication, though certainly the manuscript contains some of his
mgt delicious writing. Miss Wallace, to whom the next letter is written,
had known Mark Twain in Bermuda, and, after his death, published a
dainty volume entitled Mark Twain in the Happy Island.</p>
<p>“STORMFIELD,“ REDDING, CONNECTICUT, Nov. 13, ’09. DEAR BETSY,–I’ve
been writing “Letters from the Earth,“ and if you will come here and see
us I will–what? Put the MS in your hands, with the places to skip
marked? No. I won’t trust you quite that far. I’ll read messages to you.
This book will never be published–in fact it couldn’t be, because it
would be felony to soil the mails with it, for it has much Holy
Scripture in it of the kind that . . . can’t properly be read aloud,
except from the pulpit and in family worship. Paine enjoys it, but Paine
is going to be damned one of these days, I suppose.</p>
<p>The autumn splendors passed you by? What a pity. I wish you had been
here. It was beyond words! It was heaven and hell and sunset and
rainbows and the aurora all fused into one divine harmony, and you
couldn’t look at it and keep the tears back. All the hosannahing strong
gorgeousnesses have gone back to heaven and hell and the pole, now, but
no matter; if you could look out of my bedroom window at this moment,
you would choke up; and when you got your voice you would say: This is
not real, this is a dream. Such a singing together, and such a
whispering together, and such a snuggling together of cosy soft colors,
and such kissing and caressing, and such pretty blushing when the sun
breaks out and catches those dainty weeds at it–you remember that
weed-garden of mine?–and then–then the far hills sleeping in a dim blue
trance–oh, hearing about it is nothing, you should be here to see
it.</p>
<p>Good! I wish I could go on the platform and read. And I could, if it
could be kept out of the papers. There’s a charity-school of 400 young
girls in Boston that I would give my ears to talk to, if I had some
more; but–oh, well, I can’t go, and it’s no use to grieve about it.</p>
<p>This morning Jean went to town; also Paine; also the butler; also
Katy; also the laundress. The cook and the maid, and the boy and the
roustabout and Jean’s coachman are left–just enough to make it lonesome,
because they are around yet never visible. However, the Harpers are
sending Leigh up to play billiards; therefore I shall survive.
Affectionately, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Early in June that year, Clemens had developed unmistakable symptoms
of heart trouble of a very serious nature. It was angina pectoris, and
while to all appearances he was as well as ever and usually felt so, he
was periodically visited by severe attacks of acute “breast pains“
which, as the months passed, increased in frequency and severity. He was
alarmed and distressed–not on his own account, but because of his
daughter Jean–a handsome girl, who had long been subject to epileptic
seizures. In case of his death he feared that Jean would be without
permanent anchorage, his other daughter, Clara–following her marriage to
Ossip Gabrilowitsch in October –having taken up residence abroad.</p>
<p>This anxiety was soon ended. On the morning of December 24th, jean
Clemens was found dead in her apartment. She was not drowned in her
bath, as was reported, but died from heart exhaustion, the result of her
malady and the shock of cold water. [Questionable diagnosis! D.W.]</p>
<p>The blow to her father was terrible, but heavy as it was, one may
perhaps understand that her passing in that swift, painless way must
have afforded him a measure of relief.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Gabrilowitsch, in Europe:</p>
<p>REDDING, CONN., Dec. 29, ’09. O, Clara, Clara dear, I am so glad she
is out of it and safe–safe! I am not melancholy; I shall never be
melancholy again, I think. You see, I was in such distress when I came
to realize that you were gone far away and no one stood between her and
danger but me–and I could die at any moment, and then–oh then what would
become of her! For she was wilful, you know, and would not have been
governable.</p>
<p>You can’t imagine what a darling she was, that last two or three
days; and how fine, and good, and sweet, and noble-and joyful, thank
Heaven! –and how intellectually brilliant. I had never been acquainted
with Jean before. I recognized that.</p>
<p>But I mustn’t try to write about her–I can’t. I have already poured
my heart out with the pen, recording that last day or two.</p>
<p>I will send you that–and you must let no one but Ossip read it.</p>
<p>Good-bye. I love you so! And Ossip. FATHER.</p>
<p>The writing mentioned in the last paragraph was his article ‘The
Death of Jean,’ his last serious writing, and one of the world’s most
beautiful examples of elegiac prose.–[Harper’s Magazine, Dec., 1910,]
and later in the volume, ‘What Is Man and Other Essays.’</p>
