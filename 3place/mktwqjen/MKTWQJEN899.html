<h4 id="letters-1864-66.-san-francisco-and-hawaii">LETTERS 1864-66. SAN
FRANCISCO AND HAWAII</h4>
<p>Life on the Comstock came to an end for Mark Twain in May, 1864. It
was the time of The Flour Sack Sanitary Fund, the story of which he has
told in Roughing It. He does not, however, refer to the troubles which
this special fund brought upon himself. Coming into the Enterprise
office one night, after a gay day of “Fund“ celebration, Clemens wrote,
for next day’s paper, a paragraph intended to be merely playful, but
which proved highly offending to certain ladies concerned with the
flour-sack enterprise. No files of the paper exist today, so we cannot
judge of the quality of humor that stirred up trouble.</p>
<p>The trouble, however, was genuine enough, Virginia’s rival paper
seized upon the chance to humiliate its enemy, and presently words were
passed back and forth until nothing was left to write but a challenge.
The story of this duel, which did not come off, has been quite fully
told elsewhere, both by Mark Twain and the present writer; but the
following letter–a revelation of his inner feelings in the matter of his
offense–has never before been published.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Cutler, in Carson City:</p>
<p>VIRGINIA, May 23rd, 1864. MRS. W. K. CUTLER:</p>
<p>MADAM,–I address a lady in every sense of the term. Mrs. Clemens has
informed me of everything that has occurred in Carson in connection with
that unfortunate item of mine about the Sanitary Funds accruing from the
ball, and from what I can understand, you are almost the only lady in
your city who has understood the circumstances under which my fault was
committed, or who has shown any disposition to be lenient with me. Had
the note of the ladies been properly worded, I would have published an
ample apology instantly–and possibly I might even have done so anyhow,
had that note arrived at any other time–but it came at a moment when I
was in the midst of what ought to have been a deadly quarrel with the
publishers of the Union, and I could not come out and make public
apologies to any one at such a time. It is bad policy to do it even now
(as challenges have already passed between myself and a proprietor of
the Union, and the matter is still in abeyance,) but I suppose I had
better say a word or two to show the ladies that I did not wilfully and
maliciously do them a wrong.</p>
<p>But my chief object, Mrs. Cutler, in writing you this note (and you
will pardon the liberty I have taken,) was to thank you very kindly and
sincerely for the consideration you have shown me in this matter, and
for your continued friendship for Mollie while others are disposed to
withdraw theirs on account of a fault for which I alone am responsible.
Very truly yours, SAM. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The matter did not end with the failure of the duel. A very strict
law had just been passed, making it a felony even to send or accept a
challenge. Clemens, on the whole, rather tired of Virginia City and
Carson, thought it a good time to go across the mountains to San
Francisco. With Steve Gillis, a printer, of whom he was very fond –an
inveterate joker, who had been more than half responsible for the
proposed duel, and was to have served as his second–he took the stage
one morning, and in due time was in the California metropolis, at work
on the Morning Call.</p>
<p>Clemens had been several times in San Francisco, and loved the place.
We have no letter of that summer, the first being dated several months
after his arrival. He was still working on the Call when it was written,
and contributing literary articles to the Californian, of which Bret
Harte, unknown to fame, was editor. Harte had his office just above the
rooms of the Call, and he and Clemens were good friends. San Francisco
had a real literary group that, for a time at least, centered around the
offices of the Golden Era. In a letter that follows Clemens would seem
to have scorned this publication, but he was a frequent contributor to
it at one period. Joaquin Miller was of this band of literary pioneers;
also Prentice Mulford, Charles Warren Stoddard, Fitzhugh Ludlow, and
Orpheus C. Kerr.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>Sept. 25, 1864. MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–You can see by my picture
that this superb climate agrees with me. And it ought, after living
where I was never out of sight of snow peaks twenty-four hours during
three years. Here we have neither snow nor cold weather; fires are never
lighted, and yet summer clothes are never worn–you wear spring clothing
the year round.</p>
<p>Steve Gillis, who has been my comrade for two years, and who came
down here with me, is to be married, in a week or two, to a very pretty
girl worth 30,000 in her own right–and then I shall be alone again,
until they build a house, which they will do shortly.</p>
<p>We have been here only four months, yet we have changed our lodgings
five times, and our hotel twice. We are very comfortably fixed where we
are, now, and have no fault to find with the rooms or with the people–we
are the only lodgers in a well-to-do private family, with one grown
daughter and a piano in the parlor adjoining our room. But I need a
change, and must move again. I have taken rooms further down the street.
I shall stay in this little quiet street, because it is full of gardens
and shrubbery, and there are none but dwelling houses in it.</p>
<p>I am taking life easy, now, and I mean to keep it up for awhile. I
don’t work at night any more. I told the “Call“ folks to pay me 5 a week
and let me work only in daylight. So I get up at ten every morning, and
quit work at five or six in the afternoon. You ask if I work for
greenbacks? Hardly. What do you suppose I could do with greenbacks
here?</p>
<p>I have engaged to write for the new literary paper–the “Californian“
–same pay I used to receive on the “Golden Era“–one article a week,
fifty dollars a month. I quit the “Era,“ long ago. It wasn’t high-toned
enough. The “Californian“ circulates among the highest class of the
community, and is the best weekly literary paper in the United States
–and I suppose I ought to know.</p>
<p>I work as I always did–by fits and starts. I wrote two articles last
night for the Californian, so that lets me out for two weeks. That would
be about seventy-five dollars, in greenbacks, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Been down to San Jose (generally pronounced Sannozay–emphasis on last
syllable)–today fifty miles from here, by railroad. Town of 6,000
inhabitants, buried in flowers and shrubbery. The climate is finer than
ours here, because it is not so close to the ocean, and is protected
from the winds by the coast range.</p>
<p>I had an invitation today, to go down on an excursion to San Luis
Obispo, and from thence to the city of Mexico, to be gone six or eight
weeks, or possibly longer, but I could not accept, on account of my
contract to act as chief mourner or groomsman at Steve’s wedding.</p>
<p>I have triumphed. They refused me and other reporters some
information at a branch of the Coroner’s office–Massey’s undertaker
establishment, a few weeks ago. I published the wickedest article on
them I ever wrote in my life, and you can rest assured we got all the
information we wanted after that.</p>
<p>By the new census, San Francisco has a population of 130,000. They
don’t count the hordes of Chinamen. Yrs aftly, SAM.</p>
<p>I send a picture for Annie, and one for Aunt Ella–that is, if she
will have it.</p>
<p>Relations with the Call ceased before the end of the year, though not
in the manner described in Roughing It. Mark Twain loved to make fiction
of his mishaps, and to show himself always in a bad light. As a matter
of fact, he left the Call with great willingness, and began immediately
contributing a daily letter to the Enterprise, which brought him a
satisfactory financial return.</p>
<p>In the biographical sketch with which this volume opens, and more
extendedly elsewhere, has been told the story of the trouble growing out
of the Enterprise letters, and of Mark Twain’s sojourn with James Gillis
in the Tuolumne Hills. Also how, in the frowsy hotel at Angel’s Camp, he
heard the frog anecdote that would become the corner-stone of his fame.
There are no letters of this period–only some note-book entries. It is
probable that he did not write home, believing, no doubt, that he had
very little to say.</p>
<p>For more than a year there is not a line that has survived. Yet it
had been an important year; the jumping frog story, published in New
York, had been reprinted East and West, and laughed over in at least a
million homes. Fame had not come to him, but it was on the way.</p>
<p>Yet his outlook seems not to have been a hopeful one.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 20, 1866. MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–I do not
know what to write; my life is so uneventful. I wish I was back there
piloting up and down the river again. Verily, all is vanity and little
worth–save piloting.</p>
<p>To think that, after writing many an article a man might be excused
for thinking tolerably good, those New York people should single out a
villainous backwoods sketch to compliment me on! “Jim Smiley and His
Jumping Frog“–a squib which would never have been written but to please
Artemus Ward, and then it reached New York too late to appear in his
book.</p>
<p>But no matter. His book was a wretchedly poor one, generally
speaking, and it could be no credit to either of us to appear between
its covers.</p>
<p>This paragraph is from the New York correspondence of the San
Francisco Alta:</p>
<p>(Clipping pasted in.)</p>
<p>“Mark Twain’s story in the Saturday Press of November 18th, called
‘Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog,’ has set all New York in a roar, and
he may be said to have made his mark. I have been asked fifty times
about it and its author, and the papers are copying it far and near. It
is voted the best thing of the day. Cannot the Californian afford to
keep Mark all to itself? It should not let him scintillate so widely
without first being filtered through the California press.“</p>
<p>The New York publishing house of Carleton andandandand Co. gave the
sketch to the Saturday Press when they found it was too late for the
book.</p>
<p>Though I am generally placed at the head of my breed of scribblers in
this part of the country, the place properly belongs to Bret Harte, I
think, though he denies it, along with the rest. He wants me to club a
lot of old sketches together with a lot of his, and publish a book. I
wouldn’t do it, only he agrees to take all the trouble. But I want to
know whether we are going to make anything out of it, first. However, he
has written to a New York publisher, and if we are offered a bargain
that will pay for a month’s labor we will go to work and prepare the
volume for the press. Yours affy, SAM.</p>
<p>Bret Harte and Clemens had by this time quit the Californian,
expecting to contribute to Eastern periodicals. Clemens, however, was
not yet through with Coast journalism. There was much interest just at
this time in the Sandwich Islands, and he was selected by the foremost
Sacramento paper to spy out the islands and report aspects and
conditions there. His letters home were still infrequent, but this was
something worth writing.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, March 5th, 1866. MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–I start to
do Sandwich Islands day after tomorrow, (I suppose Annie is geographer
enough by this time to find them on the map), in the steamer “Ajax.“ We
shall arrive there in about twelve days. My friends seem determined that
I shall not lack acquaintances, for I only decided today to go, and they
have already sent me letters of introduction to everybody down there
worth knowing. I am to remain there a month and ransack the islands, the
great cataracts and the volcanoes completely, and write twenty or thirty
letters to the Sacramento Union–for which they pay me as much money as I
would get if I staid at home.</p>
<p>If I come back here I expect to start straight across the continent
by way of the Columbia river, the Pend d’Oreille Lakes, through Montana
and down the Missouri river,–only 200 miles of land travel from San
Francisco to New Orleans. Goodbye for the present. Yours, SAM.</p>
<p>His home letters from the islands are numerous enough; everything
there being so new and so delightful that he found joy in telling of it;
also, he was still young enough to air his triumphs a little, especially
when he has dined with the Grand Chamberlain and is going to visit the
King!</p>
<p>The languorous life of the islands exactly suited Mask Twain. All his
life he remembered them–always planning to return, some day, to stay
there until he died. In one of his note-books he wrote: “Went with
Mr. Dam to his cool, vine-shaded home; no care-worn or eager, anxious
faces in this land of happy contentment. God, what a contrast with
California and the Washoe!“</p>
<p>And again:</p>
<p>“Oh, Islands there are on the face of the deep Where the leaves never
fade and the skies never weep.“</p>
<p>The letters tell the story of his sojourn, which stretched itself
into nearly five months.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>HONOLULU, SANDWICH ISLANDS, April 3, 1866. MY DEAR MOTHER AND
SISTER,–I have been here two or three weeks, and like the beautiful
tropical climate better and better. I have ridden on horseback all over
this island (Oahu) in the meantime, and have visited all the ancient
battle-fields and other places of interest. I have got a lot of human
bones which I took from one of these battle-fields–I guess I will bring
you some of them. I went with the American Minister and took dinner this
evening with the King’s Grand Chamberlain, who is related to the royal
family, and although darker than a mulatto, he has an excellent English
education and in manners is an accomplished gentleman. The dinner was as
ceremonious as any I ever attended in California–five regular courses,
and five kinds of wine and one of brandy. He is to call for me in the
morning with his carriage, and we will visit the King at the palace–both
are good Masons–the King is a Royal Arch Mason. After dinner tonight
they called in the “singing girls,“ and we had some beautiful music;
sung in the native tongue.</p>
<p>The steamer I came here in sails tomorrow, and as soon as she is gone
I shall sail for the other islands of the group and visit the great
volcano–the grand wonder of the world. Be gone two months. Yrs. SAM.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>WAILUKU SUGAR PLANTATION, ISLAND OF MAUI, H. I., May 4,1866. MY DEAR
MOTHER AND SISTER,–11 O’clock at night.–This is the infernalist darkest
country, when the moon don’t shine; I stumbled and fell over my horse’s
lariat a minute ago and hurt my leg, so I must stay here tonight.</p>
<p>I got the same leg hurt last week; I said I hadn’t got hold of a
spirited horse since I had been on the island, and one of the
proprietors loaned me a big vicious colt; he was altogether too
spirited; I went to tighten the cinch before mounting him, when he let
out with his left leg (?) and kicked me across a ten-acre lot. A native
rubbed and doctored me so well that I was able to stand on my feet in
half an hour. It was then half after four and I had an appointment to go
seven miles and get a girl and take her to a card party at five.</p>
<p>I have been clattering around among the plantations for three weeks,
now, and next week I am going to visit the extinct crater of Mount
Haleakala –the largest in the world; it is ten miles to the foot of the
mountain; it rises 10,000 feet above the valley; the crater is 29 miles
in circumference and 1,000 feet deep. Seen from the summit, the city of
St. Louis would look like a picture in the bottom of it.</p>
<p>As soon as I get back from Haleakala (pronounced Hally-ekka-lah) I
will sail for Honolulu again and thence to the Island of Hawaii
(pronounced Hah-wy-ye,) to see the greatest active volcano in the
world–that of Kilauea (pronounced Kee-low-way-ah)–and from thence back
to San Francisco–and then, doubtless, to the States. I have been on this
trip two months, and it will probably be two more before I get back to
California. Yrs affy SAM.</p>
<p>He was having a glorious time–one of the most happy, carefree
adventures of his career. No form of travel or undertaking could
discountenance Mark Twain at thirty.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Orion Clemens, in Carson City:</p>
<p>HONOLULU, May 22, 1866. MY DEAR SISTER,–I have just got back from a
sea voyage–from the beautiful island of Maui, I have spent five weeks
there, riding backwards and forwards among the sugar plantations–looking
up the splendid scenery and visiting the lofty crater of Haleakala. It
has been a perfect jubilee to me in the way of pleasure.</p>
<p>I have not written a single line, and have not once thought of
business, or care or human toil or trouble or sorrow or weariness. Few
such months come in a lifetime.</p>
<p>I set sail again, a week hence, for the island of Hawaii, to see the
great active volcano of Kilauea. I shall not get back here for four or
five weeks, and shall not reach San Francisco before the latter part of
July.</p>
<p>So it is no use to wait for me to go home. Go on yourselves.</p>
<p>If I were in the east now, I could stop the publication of a
piratical book which has stolen some of my sketches.</p>
<p>It is late-good-bye, Mollie, Yr Bro SAM.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>HONOLULU, SANDWICH ISLANDS, June 21,1866. MY DEAR MOTHER AND
SISTER,–I have just got back from a hard trip through the Island of
Hawaii, begun on the 26th of May and finished on the 18th of June–only
six or seven days at sea–all the balance horse-back, and the hardest
mountain road in the world. I staid at the volcano about a week and
witnessed the greatest eruption that has occurred for years. I lived
well there. They charge a day for board, and a dollar or two extra for
guides and horses. I had a pretty good time. They didn’t charge me
anything. I have got back sick–went to bed as soon as I arrived
here–shall not be strong again for several days yet. I rushed too fast.
I ought to have taken five or six weeks on that trip.</p>
<p>A week hence I start for the Island of Kauai, to be gone three weeks
and then I go back to California.</p>
<p>The Crown Princess is dead and thousands of natives cry and wail and
dance and dance for the dead, around the King’s Palace all night and
every night. They will keep it up for a month and then she will be
buried.</p>
<p>Hon. Anson Burlingame, U. S. Minister to China, and Gen. Van
Valkenburgh, Minister to Japan, with their families and suites, have
just arrived here en route. They were going to do me the honor to call
on me this morning, and that accounts for my being out of bed now. You
know what condition my room is always in when you are not around–so I
climbed out of bed and dressed and shaved pretty quick and went up to
the residence of the American Minister and called on them.
Mr. Burlingame told me a good deal about Hon. Jere Clemens and that
Virginia Clemens who was wounded in a duel. He was in Congress years
with both of them. Mr. B. sent for his son, to introduce him–said he
could tell that frog story of mine as well as anybody. I told him I was
glad to hear it for I never tried to tell it myself without making a
botch of it. At his request I have loaned Mr. Burlingame pretty much
everything I ever wrote. I guess he will be an almighty wise man by the
time he wades through that lot.</p>
<p>If the New United States Minister to the Sandwich Islands (Hon. Edwin
McCook,) were only here now, so that I could get his views on this new
condition of Sandwich Island politics, I would sail for California at
once. But he will not arrive for two weeks yet and so I am going to
spend that interval on the island of Kauai.</p>
<p>I stopped three days with Hon. Mr. Cony, Deputy Marshal of the
Kingdom, at Hilo, Hawaii, last week and by a funny circumstance he knew
everybody that I ever knew in Hannibal and Palmyra. We used to sit up
all night talking and then sleep all day. He lives like a Prince.
Confound that Island! I had a streak of fat and a streak of lean all
over it–got lost several times and had to sleep in huts with the natives
and live like a dog.</p>
<p>Of course I couldn’t speak fifty words of the language. Take it
altogether, though, it was a mighty hard trip. Yours Affect. SAM.</p>
<p>Burlingame and Van Valkenburgh were on their way to their posts, and
their coming to the islands just at this time proved a most important
circumstance to Mark Twain. We shall come to this presently, in a
summary of the newspaper letters written to the Union. June 27th he
wrote to his mother and sister a letter, only a fragment of which
survives, in which he tells of the arrival in Honolulu of the survivors
of the ship Hornet, burned on the line, and of his securing the first
news report of the lost vessel.</p>
<p>Part of a letter to Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in
St. Louis:</p>
<p>HONOLULU, June 27, 1866 . . . . with a gill of water a day to each
man. I got the whole story from the third mate and two of the sailors.
If my account gets to the Sacramento Union first, it will be published
first all over the United States, France, England, Russia and
Germany–all over the world; I may say. You will see it. Mr. Burlingame
went with me all the time, and helped me question the men–throwing away
invitations to dinner with the princes and foreign dignitaries, and
neglecting all sorts of things to accommodate me. You know how I
appreciate that kind of thing–especially from such a man, who is
acknowledged to have no superior in the diplomatic circles of the world,
and obtained from China concessions in favor of America which were
refused to Sir Frederick Bruce and Envoys of France and Russia until
procured for them by Burlingame himself–which service was duly
acknowledged by those dignitaries. He hunted me up as soon as he came
here, and has done me a hundred favors since, and says if I will come to
China in the first trip of the great mail steamer next January and make
his house in Pekin my home, he will afford me facilities that few men
can have there for seeing and learning. He will give me letters to the
chiefs of the great Mail Steamship Company which will be of service to
me in this matter. I expect to do all this, but I expect to go to the
States first–and from China to the Paris World’s Fair.</p>
<p>Don’t show this letter. Yours affly SAM.</p>
<p>P. S. The crown Princess of this Kingdom will be buried tomorrow with
great ceremony–after that I sail in two weeks for California.</p>
<p>This concludes Mark Twain’s personal letters from the islands. Of his
descriptive news letters there were about twenty, and they were regarded
by the readers of the Union as distinctly notable. Re-reading those old
letters to-day it is not altogether easy to understand why. They were
set in fine nonpareil type, for one thing, which present-day eyes simply
refuse at any price, and the reward, by present-day standards, is not
especially tempting.</p>
<p>The letters began in the Union with the issue of April the 16th,
1866. The first–of date March 18th–tells of the writer’s arrival at
Honolulu. The humor in it is not always of a high order; it would hardly
pass for humor today at all. That the same man who wrote the Hawaiian
letters in 1866 (he was then over thirty years old) could, two years
later, have written that marvelous book, the Innocents Abroad, is a
phenomenon in literary development.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian letters, however, do show the transition stage between
the rough elemental humor of the Comstock and the refined and subtle
style which flowered in the Innocents Abroad. Certainly Mark Twain’s
genius was finding itself, and his association with the refined and
cultured personality of Anson Burlingame undoubtedly aided in that
discovery. Burlingame pointed out his faults to him, and directed him to
a better way. No more than that was needed at such a time to bring about
a transformation.</p>
<p>The Sandwich Islands letters, however, must have been precisely
adapted to their audience–a little more refined than the log Comstock, a
little less subtle than the Atlantic public–and they added materially to
his Coast prestige. But let us consider a sample extract from the first
Sandwich Islands letter:</p>
<p>Our little band of passengers were as well and thoughtfully cared for
by the friends they left weeping upon the wharf, as ever were any
similar body of pilgrims. The traveling outfit conferred upon me began
with a naval uniform, continued with a case of wine, a small assortment
of medicinal liquors and brandy, several boxes of cigars, a bunch of
matches, a fine-toothed comb, and a cake of soap, and ended with a pair
of socks. (N. B. I gave the soap to Brown, who bit into it, and then.
shook his head and said that, as a general thing, he liked to prospect
curious, foreign dishes, and find out what they were made of, but he
couldn’t go that, and threw it overboard.)</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible to imagine humor in this extract, yet it is a
fair sample of the entire letter.</p>
<p>He improves in his next, at least, in description, and gives us a
picture of the crater. In this letter, also, he writes well and
seriously, in a prophetic strain, of the great trade that is to be
established between San Francisco and Hawaii, and argues for a line of
steamers between the ports, in order that the islands might be populated
by Americans, by which course European trade in that direction could be
superseded. But the humor in this letter, such as it is, would scarcely
provoke a smile to-day.</p>
<p>As the letters continue, he still urges the fostering of the island
trade by the United States, finds himself impressed by the work of the
missionaries, who have converted cannibals to Christians, and gives
picturesque bits of the life and scenery.</p>
<p>Hawaii was then dominated chiefly by French and English; though the
American interests were by no means small.</p>
<p>Extract from letter No. 4:</p>
<p>Cap. Fitch said “There’s the king. That’s him in the buggy. I know
him as far as I can see him.“</p>
<p>I had never seen a king, and I naturally took out a note-book and put
him down: “Tall, slender, dark, full-bearded; green frock-coat, with
lapels and collar bordered with gold band an inch wide; plug hat, broad
gold band around it; royal costume looks too much like livery; this man
is not as fleshy as I thought he was.“</p>
<p>I had just got these notes when Cap. Fitch discovered that he’d got
hold of the wrong king, or rather, that he’d got hold of the king’s
driver, or a carriage driver of one of the nobility. The king wasn’t
present at all. It was a great disappointment to me. I heard afterwards
that the comfortable, easy-going king, Kamehameha V., had been seen
sitting on a barrel on the wharf, the day before, fishing. But there was
no consolation in that. That did not restore me my lost king.</p>
<p>This has something of the flavor of the man we were to know later;
the quaint, gentle resignation to disappointment which is one of the
finest touches in his humor.</p>
<p>Further on he says: “I had not shaved since I left San Francisco. As
soon as I got ashore I hunted up a striped pole, and shortly found one.
I always had a yearning to be a king. This may never be, I suppose, but,
at any rate, it will always be a satisfaction to me to know that, if I
am not a king, I am the next thing to it. I have been shaved by the
king’s barber.“</p>
<p>Honolulu was a place of cats. He saw cats of every shade and variety.
He says: “I saw cats–tomcats, Mary-Ann cats, bobtailed cats, blind cats,
one-eyed cats, wall-eyed cats, cross-eyed cats, gray cats, black cats,
white cats, yellow cats, striped cats, spotted cats, tame cats, wild
cats, singed cats, individual cats, groups of cats, platoons of cats,
companies of cats, armies of cats, multitudes of cats, millions of cats,
and all of them sleek, fat, and lazy, and sound asleep.“ Which
illustrates another characteristic of the humor we were to know
later–the humor of grotesque exaggeration, in which he was always
strong.</p>
<p>He found the islands during his periods of inaction conducive to
indolence. “If I were not so fond of looking into the rich mass of green
leaves,“ he says, “that swathe the stately tamarind right before my
door, I would idle less, and write more, I think.“</p>
<p>The Union made good use of his letters. Sometimes it printed them on
the front page. Evidently they were popular from the beginning. The
Union was a fine, handsome paper–beautiful in its minute typography, and
in its press-work; more beautiful than most papers of to-day, with their
machine-set type, their vulgar illustrations, and their chain-lightning
presses. A few more extracts:</p>
<p>“The only cigars here are those trifling, insipid, tasteless,
flavorless things they call Manilas–ten for twenty-five cents–and it
would take a thousand of them to be worth half the money. After you have
smoked about thirty-five dollars’ worth of them in the forenoon, you
feel nothing but a desperate yearning to go out somewhere and take a
smoke.“</p>
<p>“Captains and ministers form about half the population. The third
fourth is composed of Kanakas and mercantile foreigners and their
families. The final fourth is made up of high officers of the Hawaiian
government, and there are just about enough cats to go round.“</p>
<p>In No. 6, April the 2d, he says: “An excursion to Diamond Head, and
the king’s cocoanut grove, was planned to-day, at 4.30 P. M., the party
to consist of half a dozen gentlemen and three ladies. They all started
at the appointed hour except myself. Somebody remarked that it was
twenty minutes past five o’clock, and that woke me up. It was a
fortunate circumstance that Cap. Phillips was there with his ‘turn-out,’
as he calls his top buggy that Cap. Cook brought here in 1778, and a
horse that was here when Cap. Cook came.“</p>
<p>This bit has something the savor of his subsequent work, but, as a
rule, the humor compares poorly with that which was to come later.</p>
<p>In No. 7 he speaks of the natives singing American songs–not always
to his comfort. “Marching Through Georgia“ was one of their favorite
airs. He says: “If it had been all the same to Gen. Sherman, I wish he
had gone around by the way of the Gulf of Mexico, instead of marching
through Georgia.“</p>
