<h4 id="chapter-xlii.">CHAPTER XLII.</h4>
<p>Each person is born to one possession which outvalues all his
others–his last breath. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>Toward midnight, that night, there was another function. This was a
Hindoo wedding–no, I think it was a betrothal ceremony. Always before,
we had driven through streets that were multitudinous and tumultuous
with picturesque native life, but now there was nothing of that. We
seemed to move through a city of the dead. There was hardly a suggestion
of life in those still and vacant streets. Even the crows were silent.
But everywhere on the ground lay sleeping natives-hundreds and hundreds.
They lay stretched at full length and tightly wrapped in blankets, beads
and all. Their attitude and their rigidity counterfeited death. The
plague was not in Bombay then, but it is devastating the city now. The
shops are deserted, now, half of the people have fled, and of the
remainder the smitten perish by shoals every day. No doubt the city
looks now in the daytime as it looked then at night. When we had pierced
deep into the native quarter and were threading its narrow dim lanes, we
had to go carefully, for men were stretched asleep all about and there
was hardly room to drive between them. And every now and then a swarm of
rats would scamper across past the horses’ feet in the vague light–the
forbears of the rats that are carrying the plague from house to house in
Bombay now. The shops were but sheds, little booths open to the street;
and the goods had been removed, and on the counters families were
sleeping, usually with an oil lamp present. Recurrent dead watches, it
looked like.</p>
<p>But at last we turned a corner and saw a great glare of light ahead.
It was the home of the bride, wrapped in a perfect conflagration of
illuminations,–mainly gas-work designs, gotten up specially for the
occasion. Within was abundance of brilliancy–flames, costumes, colors,
decorations, mirrors–it was another Aladdin show.</p>
<p>The bride was a trim and comely little thing of twelve years, dressed
as we would dress a boy, though more expensively than we should do it,
of course. She moved about very much at her ease, and stopped and talked
with the guests and allowed her wedding jewelry to be examined. It was
very fine. Particularly a rope of great diamonds, a lovely thing to look
at and handle. It had a great emerald hanging to it.</p>
<p>The bridegroom was not present. He was having betrothal festivities
of his own at his father’s house. As I understood it, he and the bride
were to entertain company every night and nearly all night for a week or
more, then get married, if alive. Both of the children were a little
elderly, as brides and grooms go, in India–twelve; they ought to have
been married a year or two sooner; still to a, stranger twelve seems
quite young enough.</p>
<p>A while after midnight a couple of celebrated and high-priced
nautch-girls appeared in the gorgeous place, and danced and sang. With
them were men who played upon strange instruments which made uncanny
noises of a sort to make one’s flesh creep. One of these instruments was
a pipe, and to its music the girls went through a performance which
represented snake charming. It seemed a doubtful sort of music to charm
anything with, but a native gentleman assured me that snakes like it and
will come out of their holes and listen to it with every evidence of
refreshment And gratitude. He said that at an entertainment in his
grounds once, the pipe brought out half a dozen snakes, and the music
had to be stopped before they would be persuaded to go. Nobody wanted
their company, for they were bold, familiar, and dangerous; but no one
would kill them, of course, for it is sinful for a Hindoo to kill any
kind of a creature.</p>
<p>We withdrew from the festivities at two in the morning. Another
picture, then–but it has lodged itself in my memory rather as a
stage-scene than as a reality. It is of a porch and short flight of
steps crowded with dark faces and ghostly-white draperies flooded with
the strong glare from the dazzling concentration of illuminations; and
midway of the steps one conspicuous figure for accent–a turbaned giant,
with a name according to his size: Rao Bahadur Baskirao Balinkanje
Pitale, Vakeel to his Highness the Gaikwar of Baroda. Without him the
picture would not have been complete; and if his name had been merely
Smith, he wouldn’t have answered. Close at hand on house-fronts on both
sides of the narrow street were illuminations of a kind commonly
employed by the natives –scores of glass tumblers (containing tapers)
fastened a few in inches apart all over great latticed frames, forming
starry constellations which showed out vividly against their black back
grounds. As we drew away into the distance down the dim lanes the
illuminations gathered together into a single mass, and glowed out of
the enveloping darkness like a sun.</p>
<p>Then again the deep silence, the skurrying rats, the dim forms
stretched every-where on the ground; and on either hand those open
booths counterfeiting sepulchres, with counterfeit corpses sleeping
motionless in the flicker of the counterfeit death lamps. And now, a
year later, when I read the cablegrams I seem to be reading of what I
myself partly saw–saw before it happened–in a prophetic dream, as it
were. One cablegram says, “Business in the native town is about
suspended. Except the wailing and the tramp of the funerals. There is
but little life or movement. The closed shops exceed in number those
that remain open.“ Another says that 325,000 of the people have fled the
city and are carrying the plague to the country. Three days later comes
the news, “The population is reduced by half.“ The refugees have carried
the disease to Karachi; “220 cases, 214 deaths.“ A day or two later, “52
fresh cases, all of which proved fatal.“</p>
<p>The plague carries with it a terror which no other disease can
excite; for of all diseases known to men it is the deadliest–by far the
deadliest. “Fifty-two fresh cases–all fatal.“ It is the Black Death
alone that slays like that. We can all imagine, after a fashion, the
desolation of a plague-stricken city, and the stupor of stillness broken
at intervals by distant bursts of wailing, marking the passing of
funerals, here and there and yonder, but I suppose it is not possible
for us to realize to ourselves the nightmare of dread and fear that
possesses the living who are present in such a place and cannot get
away. That half million fled from Bombay in a wild panic suggests to us
something of what they were feeling, but perhaps not even they could
realize what the half million were feeling whom they left stranded
behind to face the stalking horror without chance of escape. Kinglake
was in Cairo many years ago during an epidemic of the Black Death, and
he has imagined the terrors that creep into a man’s heart at such a time
and follow him until they themselves breed the fatal sign in the armpit,
and then the delirium with confused images, and home-dreams, and reeling
billiard-tables, and then the sudden blank of death:</p>
<p>“To the contagionist, filled as he is with the dread of final causes,
having no faith in destiny, nor in the fixed will of God, and with none
of the devil-may-care indifference which might stand him instead of
creeds–to such one, every rag that shivers in the breeze of a
plague-stricken city has this sort of sublimity. If by any terrible
ordinance he be forced to venture forth, be sees death dangling from
every sleeve; and, as he creeps forward, he poises his shuddering limbs
between the imminent jacket that is stabbing at his right elbow and the
murderous pelisse that threatens to mow him clean down as it sweeps
along on his left. But most of all he dreads that which most of all he
should love–the touch of a woman’s dress; for mothers and wives,
hurrying forth on kindly errands from the bedsides of the dying, go
slouching along through the streets more willfully and less courteously
than the men. For a while it may be that the caution of the poor
Levantine may enable him to avoid contact, but sooner or later, perhaps,
the dreaded chance arrives; that bundle of linen, with the dark tearful
eyes at the top of it, that labors along with the voluptuous clumsiness
of Grisi –she has touched the poor Levantine with the hem of her sleeve!
From that dread moment his peace is gone; his mind for ever hanging upon
the fatal touch invites the blow which he fears; he watches for the
symptoms of plague so carefully, that sooner or later they come in
truth. The parched mouth is a sign–his mouth is parched; the throbbing
brain–his brain does throb; the rapid pulse–he touches his own wrist
(for he dares not ask counsel of any man lest he be deserted), he
touches his wrist, and feels how his frighted blood goes galloping out
of his heart. There is nothing but the fatal swelling that is wanting to
make his sad conviction complete; immediately, he has an odd feel under
the arm–no pain, but a little straining of the skin; he would to God it
were his fancy that were strong enough to give him that sensation; this
is the worst of all. It now seems to him that he could be happy and
contented with his parched mouth, and his throbbing brain, and his rapid
pulse, if only he could know that there were no swelling under the left
arm; but dares he try?–in a moment of calmness and deliberation he dares
not; but when for a while he has writhed under the torture of suspense,
a sudden strength of will drives him to seek and know his fate; he
touches the gland, and finds the skin sane and sound but under the
cuticle there lies a small lump like a pistol-bullet, that moves as he
pushes it. Oh! but is this for all certainty, is this the sentence of
death? Feel the gland of the other arm. There is not the same lump
exactly, yet something a little like it. Have not some people glands
naturally enlarged?–would to heaven he were one! So he does for himself
the work of the plague, and when the Angel of Death thus courted does
indeed and in truth come, he has only to finish that which has been so
well begun; he passes his fiery hand over the brain of the victim, and
lets him rave for a season, but all chance-wise, of people and things
once dear, or of people and things indifferent. Once more the poor
fellow is back at his home in fair Provence, and sees the sundial that
stood in his childhood’s garden–sees his mother, and the long-since
forgotten face of that little dear sister–(he sees her, he says, on a
Sunday morning, for all the church bells are ringing); he looks up and
down through the universe, and owns it well piled with bales upon bales
of cotton, and cotton eternal–so much so that he feels–he knows–he
swears he could make that winning hazard, if the billiard-table would
not slant upwards, and if the cue were a cue worth playing with; but it
is not–it’s a cue that won’t move–his own arm won’t move–in short,
there’s the devil to pay in the brain of the poor Levantine; and
perhaps, the next night but one he becomes the ‘life and the soul’ of
some squalling jackal family, who fish him out by the foot from his
shallow and sandy grave.“</p>
