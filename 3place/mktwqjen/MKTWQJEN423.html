<h4 id="chapter-40-castles-and-culture">Chapter 40 Castles and
Culture</h4>
<p>BATON ROUGE was clothed in flowers, like a bride–no, much more so;
like a greenhouse. For we were in the absolute South now–no
modifications, no compromises, no half-way measures. The magnolia-trees
in the Capitol grounds were lovely and fragrant, with their dense rich
foliage and huge snow-ball blossoms. The scent of the flower is very
sweet, but you want distance on it, because it is so powerful. They are
not good bedroom blossoms–they might suffocate one in his sleep. We were
certainly in the South at last; for here the sugar region begins, and
the plantations–vast green levels, with sugar-mill and negro quarters
clustered together in the middle distance–were in view. And there was a
tropical sun overhead and a tropical swelter in the air.</p>
<p>And at this point, also, begins the pilot’s paradise: a wide river
hence to New Orleans, abundance of water from shore to shore, and no
bars, snags, sawyers, or wrecks in his road.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott is probably responsible for the Capitol building;
for it is not conceivable that this little sham castle would ever have
been built if he had not run the people mad, a couple of generations
ago, with his medieval romances. The South has not yet recovered from
the debilitating influence of his books. Admiration of his fantastic
heroes and their grotesque ‘chivalry’ doings and romantic juvenilities
still survives here, in an atmosphere in which is already perceptible
the wholesome and practical nineteenth-century smell of cotton-factories
and locomotives; and traces of its inflated language and other windy
humbuggeries survive along with it. It is pathetic enough, that a
whitewashed castle, with turrets and things–materials all ungenuine
within and without, pretending to be what they are not–should ever have
been built in this otherwise honorable place; but it is much more
pathetic to see this architectural falsehood undergoing restoration and
perpetuation in our day, when it would have been so easy to let dynamite
finish what a charitable fire began, and then devote this restoration-
money to the building of something genuine.</p>
<p>Baton Rouge has no patent on imitation castles, however, and no
monopoly of them. Here is a picture from the advertisement of the
‘Female Institute’ of Columbia; Tennessee. The following remark is from
the same advertisement–</p>
<p>‘The Institute building has long been famed as a model of striking
and beautiful architecture. Visitors are charmed with its resemblance to
the old castles of song and story, with its towers, turreted walls, and
ivy-mantled porches.’</p>
<p>Keeping school in a castle is a romantic thing; as romantic as
keeping hotel in a castle.</p>
<p>By itself the imitation castle is doubtless harmless, and well
enough; but as a symbol and breeder and sustainer of maudlin Middle-Age
romanticism here in the midst of the plainest and sturdiest and
infinitely greatest and worthiest of all the centuries the world has
seen, it is necessarily a hurtful thing and a mistake.</p>
<p>Here is an extract from the prospectus of a Kentucky ‘Female
College.’ Female college sounds well enough; but since the phrasing it
in that unjustifiable way was done purely in the interest of brevity, it
seems to me that she-college would have been still better–because
shorter, and means the same thing: that is, if either phrase means
anything at all–</p>
<p>‘The president is southern by birth, by rearing, by education, and by
sentiment; the teachers are all southern in sentiment, and with the
exception of those born in Europe were born and raised in the south.
Believing the southern to be the highest type of civilization this
continent has seen, the young ladies are trained according to the
southern ideas of delicacy, refinement, womanhood, religion, and
propriety; hence we offer a first-class female college for the south and
solicit southern patronage.’</p>
<p>{footnote (long one) [Illustrations of it thoughtlessly omitted by
the advertiser:</p>
<p>KNOXVILLE, Tenn., October 19.–This morning a few minutes after ten
o’clock, General Joseph A. Mabry, Thomas O’Connor, and Joseph A. Mabry,
Jr., were killed in a shooting affray. The difficulty began yesterday
afternoon by General Mabry attacking Major O’Connor and threatening to
kill him. This was at the fair grounds, and O’Connor told Mabry that it
was not the place to settle their difficulties. Mabry then told O’Connor
he should not live. It seems that Mabry was armed and O’Connor was not.
The cause of the difficulty was an old feud about the transfer of some
property from Mabry to O’Connor. Later in the afternoon Mabry sent word
to O’Connor that he would kill him on sight. This morning Major O’Connor
was standing in the door of the Mechanics’ National Bank, of which he
was president. General Mabry and another gentleman walked down Gay
Street on the opposite side from the bank. O’Connor stepped into the
bank, got a shot gun, took deliberate aim at General Mabry and fired.
Mabry fell dead, being shot in the left side. As he fell O’Connor fired
again, the shot taking effect in Mabry’s thigh. O’Connor then reached
into the bank and got another shot gun. About this time Joseph A. Mabry,
Jr., son of General Mabry, came rushing down the street, unseen by
O’Connor until within forty feet, when the young man fired a pistol, the
shot taking effect in O’Connor’s right breast, passing through the body
near the heart. The instant Mabry shot, O’Connor turned and fired, the
load taking effect in young Mabry’s right breast and side. Mabry fell
pierced with twenty buckshot, and almost instantly O’Connor fell dead
without a struggle. Mabry tried to rise, but fell back dead. The whole
tragedy occurred within two minutes, and neither of the three spoke
after he was shot. General Mabry had about thirty buckshot in his body.
A bystander was painfully wounded in the thigh with a buckshot, and
another was wounded in the arm. Four other men had their clothing
pierced by buckshot. The affair caused great excitement, and Gay Street
was thronged with thousands of people. General Mabry and his son Joe
were acquitted only a few days ago of the murder of Moses Lusby and Don
Lusby, father and son, whom they killed a few weeks ago. Will Mabry was
killed by Don Lusby last Christmas. Major Thomas O’Connor was President
of the Mechanics’ National Bank here, and was the wealthiest man in the
State.–ASSOCIATED PRESS TELEGRAM.</p>
<p>One day last month, Professor Sharpe, of the Somerville, Tenn.,
Female College, ‘a quiet and gentlemanly man,’ was told that his
brother-in- law, a Captain Burton, had threatened to kill him. Burton, t
seems, had already killed one man and driven his knife into another. The
Professor armed himself with a double-barreled shot gun, started out in
search of his brother-in-law, found him playing billiards in a saloon,
and blew his brains out. The ‘Memphis Avalanche’ reports that the
Professor’s course met with pretty general approval in the community;
knowing that the law was powerless, in the actual condition of public
sentiment, to protect him, he protected himself.</p>
<p>About the same time, two young men in North Carolina quarreled about
a girl, and ‘hostile messages’ were exchanged. Friends tried to
reconcile them, but had their labor for their pains. On the 24th the
young men met in the public highway. One of them had a heavy club in his
hand, the other an ax. The man with the club fought desperately for his
life, but it was a hopeless fight from the first. A well-directed blow
sent his club whirling out of his grasp, and the next moment he was a
dead man.</p>
<p>About the same time, two ‘highly connected’ young Virginians, clerks
in a hardware store at Charlottesville, while ‘skylarking,’ came to
blows. Peter Dick threw pepper in Charles Roads’s eyes; Roads demanded
an apology; Dick refused to give it, and it was agreed that a duel was
inevitable, but a difficulty arose; the parties had no pistols, and it
was too late at night to procure them. One of them suggested that
butcher-knives would answer the purpose, and the other accepted the
suggestion; the result was that Roads fell to the floor with a gash in
his abdomen that may or may not prove fatal. If Dick has been arrested,
the news has not reached us. He ‘expressed deep regret,’ and we are told
by a Staunton correspondent of the PHILADELPHIA PRESS that ‘every effort
has been made to hush the matter up.’–EXTRACTS FROM THE PUBLIC
JOURNALS.]}</p>
<p>What, warder, ho! the man that can blow so complacent a blast as
that, probably blows it from a castle.</p>
<p>From Baton Rouge to New Orleans, the great sugar plantations border
both sides of the river all the way, and stretch their league-wide
levels back to the dim forest-walls of bearded cypress in the rear.
Shores lonely no longer. Plenty of dwellings all the way, on both banks–
standing so close together, for long distances, that the broad river
lying between the two rows, becomes a sort of spacious street. A most
home-like and happy-looking region. And now and then you see a pillared
and porticoed great manor-house, embowered in trees. Here is testimony
of one or two of the procession of foreign tourists that filed along
here half a century ago. Mrs. Trollope says–</p>
<p>‘The unbroken flatness of the banks of the Mississippi continued
unvaried for many miles above New Orleans; but the graceful and
luxuriant palmetto, the dark and noble ilex, and the bright orange, were
everywhere to be seen, and it was many days before we were weary of
looking at them.’</p>
<p>Captain Basil Hall–</p>
<p>’The district of country which lies adjacent to the Mississippi, in
the lower parts of Louisiana, is everywhere thickly peopled by sugar
planters, whose showy houses, gay piazzas, trig gardens, and numerous
slave-villages, all clean and neat, gave an exceedingly thriving air to
the river scenery.</p>
<p>All the procession paint the attractive picture in the same way. The
descriptions of fifty years ago do not need to have a word changed in
order to exactly describe the same region as it appears to-day–except as
to the ‘trigness’ of the houses. The whitewash is gone from the negro
cabins now; and many, possibly most, of the big mansions, once so
shining white, have worn out their paint and have a decayed, neglected
look. It is the blight of the war. Twenty-one years ago everything was
trim and trig and bright along the ‘coast,’ just as it had been in 1827,
as described by those tourists.</p>
<p>Unfortunate tourists! People humbugged them with stupid and silly
lies, and then laughed at them for believing and printing the same. They
told Mrs. Trollope that the alligators–or crocodiles, as she calls them–
were terrible creatures; and backed up the statement with a blood-
curdling account of how one of these slandered reptiles crept into a
squatter cabin one night, and ate up a woman and five children. The
woman, by herself, would have satisfied any ordinarily-impossible
alligator; but no, these liars must make him gorge the five children
besides. One would not imagine that jokers of this robust breed would be
sensitive–but they were. It is difficult, at this day, to understand,
and impossible to justify, the reception which the book of the grave,
honest, intelligent, gentle, manly, charitable, well-meaning Capt. Basil
Hall got.</p>
