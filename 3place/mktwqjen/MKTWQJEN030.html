<h4 id="chapter-xxix.">CHAPTER XXIX.</h4>
<p>The ship is lying here in the harbor of Naples–quarantined. She has
been here several days and will remain several more. We that came by
rail from Rome have escaped this misfortune. Of course no one is allowed
to go on board the ship, or come ashore from her. She is a prison, now.
The passengers probably spend the long, blazing days looking out from
under the awnings at Vesuvius and the beautiful city–and in swearing.
Think of ten days of this sort of pastime!–We go out every day in a boat
and request them to come ashore. It soothes them. We lie ten steps from
the ship and tell them how splendid the city is; and how much better the
hotel fare is here than any where else in Europe; and how cool it is;
and what frozen continents of ice cream there are; and what a time we
are having cavorting about the country and sailing to the islands in the
Bay. This tranquilizes them.</p>
<p>ASCENT OF VESUVIUS.</p>
<p>I shall remember our trip to Vesuvius for many a day–partly because
of its sight-seeing experiences, but chiefly on account of the fatigue
of the journey. Two or three of us had been resting ourselves among the
tranquil and beautiful scenery of the island of Ischia, eighteen miles
out in the harbor, for two days; we called it “resting,“ but I do not
remember now what the resting consisted of, for when we got back to
Naples we had not slept for forty-eight hours. We were just about to go
to bed early in the evening, and catch up on some of the sleep we had
lost, when we heard of this Vesuvius expedition. There was to be eight
of us in the party, and we were to leave Naples at midnight. We laid in
some provisions for the trip, engaged carriages to take us to
Annunciation, and then moved about the city, to keep awake, till twelve.
We got away punctually, and in the course of an hour and a half arrived
at the town of Annunciation. Annunciation is the very last place under
the sun. In other towns in Italy the people lie around quietly and wait
for you to ask them a question or do some overt act that can be charged
for–but in Annunciation they have lost even that fragment of delicacy;
they seize a lady’s shawl from a chair and hand it to her and charge a
penny; they open a carriage door, and charge for it–shut it when you get
out, and charge for it; they help you to take off a duster–two cents;
brush your clothes and make them worse than they were before–two cents;
smile upon you–two cents; bow, with a lick-spittle smirk, hat in hand
–two cents; they volunteer all information, such as that the mules will
arrive presently–two cents–warm day, sir–two cents–take you four hours
to make the ascent–two cents. And so they go. They crowd you –infest
you–swarm about you, and sweat and smell offensively, and look sneaking
and mean, and obsequious. There is no office too degrading for them to
perform, for money. I have had no opportunity to find out any thing
about the upper classes by my own observation, but from what I hear said
about them I judge that what they lack in one or two of the bad traits
the canaille have, they make up in one or two others that are worse. How
the people beg!–many of them very well dressed, too.</p>
<p>I said I knew nothing against the upper classes by personal
observation. I must recall it! I had forgotten. What I saw their bravest
and their fairest do last night, the lowest multitude that could be
scraped up out of the purlieus of Christendom would blush to do, I
think. They assembled by hundreds, and even thousands, in the great
Theatre of San Carlo, to do–what? Why, simply, to make fun of an old
woman–to deride, to hiss, to jeer at an actress they once worshipped,
but whose beauty is faded now and whose voice has lost its former
richness. Every body spoke of the rare sport there was to be. They said
the theatre would be crammed, because Frezzolini was going to sing. It
was said she could not sing well, now, but then the people liked to see
her, anyhow. And so we went. And every time the woman sang they hissed
and laughed–the whole magnificent house–and as soon as she left the
stage they called her on again with applause. Once or twice she was
encored five and six times in succession, and received with hisses when
she appeared, and discharged with hisses and laughter when she had
finished–then instantly encored and insulted again! And how the
high-born knaves enjoyed it! White-kidded gentlemen and ladies laughed
till the tears came, and clapped their hands in very ecstacy when that
unhappy old woman would come meekly out for the sixth time, with
uncomplaining patience, to meet a storm of hisses! It was the cruelest
exhibition–the most wanton, the most unfeeling. The singer would have
conquered an audience of American rowdies by her brave, unflinching
tranquillity (for she answered encore after encore, and smiled and bowed
pleasantly, and sang the best she possibly could, and went bowing off,
through all the jeers and hisses, without ever losing countenance or
temper:) and surely in any other land than Italy her sex and her
helplessness must have been an ample protection to her–she could have
needed no other. Think what a multitude of small souls were crowded into
that theatre last night. If the manager could have filled his theatre
with Neapolitan souls alone, without the bodies, he could not have
cleared less than ninety millions of dollars. What traits of character
must a man have to enable him to help three thousand miscreants to hiss,
and jeer, and laugh at one friendless old woman, and shamefully
humiliate her? He must have all the vile, mean traits there are. My
observation persuades me (I do not like to venture beyond my own
personal observation,) that the upper classes of Naples possess those
traits of character. Otherwise they may be very good people; I can not
say.</p>
<p>ASCENT OF VESUVIUS–CONTINUED.</p>
<p>In this city of Naples, they believe in and support one of the
wretchedest of all the religious impostures one can find in Italy–the
miraculous liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius. Twice a year the
priests assemble all the people at the Cathedral, and get out this vial
of clotted blood and let them see it slowly dissolve and become liquid
–and every day for eight days, this dismal farce is repeated, while the
priests go among the crowd and collect money for the exhibition. The
first day, the blood liquefies in forty-seven minutes–the church is
crammed, then, and time must be allowed the collectors to get around:
after that it liquefies a little quicker and a little quicker, every
day, as the houses grow smaller, till on the eighth day, with only a few
dozens present to see the miracle, it liquefies in four minutes.</p>
<p>And here, also, they used to have a grand procession, of priests,
citizens, soldiers, sailors, and the high dignitaries of the City
Government, once a year, to shave the head of a made-up Madonna–a
stuffed and painted image, like a milliner’s dummy–whose hair
miraculously grew and restored itself every twelve months. They still
kept up this shaving procession as late as four or five years ago. It
was a source of great profit to the church that possessed the remarkable
effigy, and the ceremony of the public barbering of her was always
carried out with the greatest possible eclat and display–the more the
better, because the more excitement there was about it the larger the
crowds it drew and the heavier the revenues it produced–but at last a
day came when the Pope and his servants were unpopular in Naples, and
the City Government stopped the Madonna’s annual show.</p>
<p>There we have two specimens of these Neapolitans–two of the silliest
possible frauds, which half the population religiously and faithfully
believed, and the other half either believed also or else said nothing
about, and thus lent themselves to the support of the imposture. I am
very well satisfied to think the whole population believed in those
poor, cheap miracles–a people who want two cents every time they bow to
you, and who abuse a woman, are capable of it, I think.</p>
<p>ASCENT OF VESUVIUS–CONTINUED.</p>
<p>These Neapolitans always ask four times as much money as they intend
to take, but if you give them what they first demand, they feel ashamed
of themselves for aiming so low, and immediately ask more. When money is
to be paid and received, there is always some vehement jawing and
gesticulating about it. One can not buy and pay for two cents’ worth of
clams without trouble and a quarrel. One “course,“ in a two-horse
carriage, costs a franc–that is law–but the hackman always demands more,
on some pretence or other, and if he gets it he makes a new demand. It
is said that a stranger took a one-horse carriage for a course –tariff,
half a franc. He gave the man five francs, by way of experiment. He
demanded more, and received another franc. Again he demanded more, and
got a franc–demanded more, and it was refused. He grew vehement –was
again refused, and became noisy. The stranger said, “Well, give me the
seven francs again, and I will see what I can do“–and when he got them,
he handed the hackman half a franc, and he immediately asked for two
cents to buy a drink with. It may be thought that I am prejudiced.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am. I would be ashamed of myself if I were not.</p>
<p>ASCENT OF VESUVIUS–CONTINUED.</p>
<p>Well, as I was saying, we got our mules and horses, after an hour and
a half of bargaining with the population of Annunciation, and started
sleepily up the mountain, with a vagrant at each mule’s tail who
pretended to be driving the brute along, but was really holding on and
getting himself dragged up instead. I made slow headway at first, but I
began to get dissatisfied at the idea of paying my minion five francs to
hold my mule back by the tail and keep him from going up the hill, and
so I discharged him. I got along faster then.</p>
<p>We had one magnificent picture of Naples from a high point on the
mountain side. We saw nothing but the gas lamps, of course–two-thirds of
a circle, skirting the great Bay–a necklace of diamonds glinting up
through the darkness from the remote distance–less brilliant than the
stars overhead, but more softly, richly beautiful–and over all the great
city the lights crossed and recrossed each other in many and many a
sparkling line and curve. And back of the town, far around and abroad
over the miles of level campagna, were scattered rows, and circles, and
clusters of lights, all glowing like so many gems, and marking where a
score of villages were sleeping. About this time, the fellow who was
hanging on to the tail of the horse in front of me and practicing all
sorts of unnecessary cruelty upon the animal, got kicked some fourteen
rods, and this incident, together with the fairy spectacle of the lights
far in the distance, made me serenely happy, and I was glad I started to
Vesuvius.</p>
<p>ASCENT OF MOUNT VESUVIUS–CONTINUED.</p>
<p>This subject will be excellent matter for a chapter, and tomorrow or
next day I will write it.</p>
