<h4 id="chapter-28-joan-foretells-her-doom">CHAPTER 28 Joan Foretells
Her Doom</h4>
<p>THE TROOPS must have a rest. Two days would be allowed for this.</p>
<p>The morning of the 14th I was writing from Joan’s dictation in a
small room which she sometimes used as a private office when she wanted
to get away from officials and their interruptions. Catherine Boucher
came in and sat down and said:</p>
<p>“Joan, dear, I want you to talk to me.“</p>
<p>“Indeed, I am not sorry for that, but glad. What is in your
mind?“</p>
<p>“This. I scarcely slept last night, for thinking of the dangers you
are running. The Paladin told me how you made the duke stand out of the
way when the cannon-balls were flying all about, and so saved his
life.“</p>
<p>“Well, that was right, wasn’t it?“</p>
<p>“Right? Yes; but you stayed there yourself. Why will you do like
that? It seems such a wanton risk.“</p>
<p>“Oh, no, it was not so. I was not in any danger.“</p>
<p>“How can you say that, Joan, with those deadly things flying all
about you?“</p>
<p>Joan laughed, and tried to turn the subject, but Catherine persisted.
She said:</p>
<p>“It was horribly dangerous, and it could not be necessary to stay in
such a place. And you led an assault again. Joan, it is tempting
Providence. I want you to make me a promise. I want you to promise me
that you will let others lead the assaults, if there must be assaults,
and that you will take better care of yourself in those dreadful
battles. Will you?“</p>
<p>But Joan fought away from the promise and did not give it. Catherine
sat troubled and discontented awhile, then she said:</p>
<p>“Joan, are you going to be a soldier always? These wars are so
long–so long. They last forever and ever and ever.“</p>
<p>There was a glad flash in Joan’s eye as she cried:</p>
<p>“This campaign will do all the really hard work that is in front of
it in the next four days. The rest of it will be gentler–oh, far less
bloody. Yes, in four days France will gather another trophy like the
redemption of Orleans and make her second long step toward freedom!“</p>
<p>Catherine started (and do did I); then she gazed long at Joan like
one in a trance, murmuring “four days–four days,“ as if to herself and
unconsciously. Finally she asked, in a low voice that had something of
awe in it:</p>
<p>“Joan, tell me–how is it that you know that? For you do know it, I
think.“</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said Joan, dreamily, “I know–I know. I shall strike–and strike
again. And before the fourth day is finished I shall strike yet again.“
She became silent. We sat wondering and still. This was for a whole
minute, she looking at the floor and her lips moving but uttering
nothing. Then came these words, but hardly audible: “And in a thousand
years the English power in France will not rise up from that blow.“</p>
<p>It made my flesh creep. It was uncanny. She was in a trance again–I
could see it–just as she was that day in the pastures of Domremy when
she prophesied about us boys in the war and afterward did not know that
she had done it. She was not conscious now; but Catherine did not know
that, and so she said, in a happy voice:</p>
<p>“Oh, I believe it, I believe it, and I am so glad! Then you will come
back and bide with us all your life long, and we will love you so, and
honor you!“</p>
<p>A scarcely perceptible spasm flitted across Joan’s face, and the
dreamy voice muttered:</p>
<p>“Before two years are sped I shall die a cruel death!“</p>
<p>I sprang forward with a warning hand up. That is why Catherine did
not scream. She was going to do that–I saw it plainly. Then I whispered
her to slip out of the place, and say nothing of what had happened. I
said Joan was asleep–asleep and dreaming. Catherine whispered back, and
said:</p>
<p>“Oh, I am so grateful that it is only a dream! It sounded like
prophecy.“ And she was gone.</p>
<p>Like prophecy! I knew it was prophecy; and I sat down crying, as
knowing we should lose her. Soon she started, shivering slightly, and
came to herself, and looked around and saw me crying there, and jumped
out of her chair and ran to me all in a whirl of sympathy and
compassion, and put her hand on my head, and said:</p>
<p>“My poor boy! What is it? Look up and tell me.“</p>
<p>I had to tell her a lie; I grieved to do it, but there was no other
way. I picked up an old letter from my table, written by Heaven knows
who, about some matter Heaven knows what, and told her I had just gotten
it from Pere Fronte, and that in it it said the children’s Fairy Tree
had been chopped down by some miscreant or other, and– I got no further.
She snatched the letter from my hand and searched it up and down and all
over, turning it this way and that, and sobbing great sobs, and the
tears flowing down her cheeks, and ejaculating all the time, “Oh, cruel,
cruel! how could any be so heartless? Ah, poor Arbre Fee de Bourlemont
gone–and we children loved it so! Show me the place where it says
it!“</p>
<p>And I, still lying, showed her the pretended fatal words on the
pretended fatal page, and she gazed at them through her tears, and said
she could see herself that they were hateful, ugly words–they “had the
very look of it.“</p>
<p>Then we heard a strong voice down the corridor announcing:</p>
<p>“His majesty’s messenger–with despatches for her Excellency the
Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of France!“</p>
<p>29 Fierce Talbot Reconsiders</p>
<p>I KNEW she had seen the wisdom of the Tree. But when? I could not
know. Doubtless before she had lately told the King to use her, for that
she had but one year left to work in. It had not occurred to me at the
time, but the conviction came upon me now that at that time she had
already seen the Tree. It had brought her a welcome message; that was
plain, otherwise she could not have been so joyous and light-hearted as
she had been these latter days. The death-warning had nothing dismal
about it for her; no, it was remission of exile, it was leave to come
home.</p>
<p>Yes, she had seen the Tree. No one had taken the prophecy to heart
which she made to the King; and for a good reason, no doubt; no one
wanted to take it to heart; all wanted to banish it away and forget it.
And all had succeeded, and would go on to the end placid and
comfortable. All but me alone. I must carry my awful secret without any
to help me. A heavy load, a bitter burden; and would cost me a daily
heartbreak. She was to die; and so soon. I had never dreamed of that.
How could I, and she so strong and fresh and young, and every day
earning a new right to a peaceful and honored old age? For at that time
I though old age valuable. I do not know why, but I thought so. All
young people think it, I believe, they being ignorant and full of
superstitions. She had seen the Tree. All that miserable night those
ancient verses went floating back and forth through my brain:</p>
<p>And when, in exile wand’ring, we Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of
thee, Oh, rise upon our sight!</p>
<p>But at dawn the bugles and the drums burst through the dreamy hush of
the morning, and it was turn out all! mount and ride. For there was red
work to be done.</p>
<p>We marched to Meung without halting. There we carried the bridge by
assault, and left a force to hold it, the rest of the army marching away
next morning toward Beaugency, where the lion Talbot, the terror of the
French, was in command. When we arrived at that place, the English
retired into the castle and we sat down in the abandoned town.</p>
<p>Talbot was not at the moment present in person, for he had gone away
to watch for and welcome Fastolfe and his reinforcement of five thousand
men.</p>
<p>Joan placed her batteries and bombarded the castle till night. Then
some news came: Richemont, Constable of France, this long time in
disgrace with the King, largely because of the evil machinations of La
Tremouille and his party, was approaching with a large body of men to
offer his services to Joan–and very much she needed them, now that
Fastolfe was so close by. Richemont had wanted to join us before, when
we first marched on Orleans; but the foolish King, slave of those paltry
advisers of his, warned him to keep his distance and refused all
reconciliation with him.</p>
<p>I go into these details because they are important. Important because
they lead up to the exhibition of a new gift in Joan’s extraordinary
mental make-up–statesmanship. It is a sufficiently strange thing to find
that great quality in an ignorant country-girl of seventeen and a half,
but she had it.</p>
<p>Joan was for receiving Richemont cordially, and so was La Hire and
the two young Lavals and other chiefs, but the Lieutenant-General,
d’Alencon, strenuously and stubbornly opposed it. He said he had
absolute orders from the King to deny and defy Richemont, and that if
they were overridden he would leave the army. This would have been a
heavy disaster, indeed. But Joan set herself the task of persuading him
that the salvation of France took precedence of all minor things–even
the commands of a sceptered ass; and she accomplished it. She persuaded
him to disobey the King in the interest of the nation, and to be
reconciled to Count Richemont and welcome him. That was statesmanship;
and of the highest and soundest sort. Whatever thing men call great,
look for it in Joan of Arc, and there you will find it.</p>
<p>In the early morning, June 17th, the scouts reported the approach of
Talbot and Fastolfe with Fastolfe’s succoring force. Then the drums beat
to arms; and we set forth to meet the English, leaving Richemont and his
troops behind to watch the castle of Beaugency and keep its garrison at
home. By and by we came in sight of the enemy. Fastolfe had tried to
convince Talbot that it would be wisest to retreat and not risk a battle
with Joan at this time, but distribute the new levies among the English
strongholds of the Loire, thus securing them against capture; then be
patient and wait–wait for more levies from Paris; let Joan exhaust her
army with fruitless daily skirmishing; then at the right time fall upon
her in resistless mass and annihilate her. He was a wise old experienced
general, was Fastolfe. But that fierce Talbot would hear of no delay. He
was in a rage over the punishment which the Maid had inflicted upon him
at Orleans and since, and he swore by God and Saint George that he would
have it out with her if he had to fight her all alone. So Fastolfe
yielded, though he said they were now risking the loss of everything
which the English had gained by so many years’ work and so many hard
knocks.</p>
<p>The enemy had taken up a strong position, and were waiting, in order
of battle, with their archers to the front and a stockade before
them.</p>
<p>Night was coming on. A messenger came from the English with a rude
defiance and an offer of battle. But Joan’s dignity was not ruffled, her
bearing was not discomposed. She said to the herald:</p>
<p>“Go back and say it is too late to meet to-night; but to-morrow,
please God and our Lady, we will come to close quarters.“</p>
<p>The night fell dark and rainy. It was that sort of light steady rain
which falls so softly and brings to one’s spirit such serenity and
peace. About ten o’clock D’Alencon, the Bastard of Orleans, La Hire,
Pothon of Saintrailles, and two or three other generals came to our
headquarters tent, and sat down to discuss matters with Joan. Some
thought it was a pity that Joan had declined battle, some thought not.
Then Pothon asked her why she had declined it. She said:</p>
<p>“There was more than one reason. These English are ours–they cannot
get away from us. Wherefore there is no need to take risks, as at other
times. The day was far spent. It is good to have much time and the fair
light of day when one’s force is in a weakened state–nine hundred of us
yonder keeping the bridge of Meung under the Marshal de Rais, fifteen
hundred with the Constable of France keeping the bridge and watching the
castle of Beaugency.“</p>
<p>Dunois said:</p>
<p>“I grieve for this decision, Excellency, but it cannot be helped. And
the case will be the same the morrow, as to that.“</p>
<p>Joan was walking up and down just then. She laughed her affectionate,
comrady laugh, and stopping before that old war-tiger she put her small
hand above his head and touched one of his plumes, saying:</p>
<p>“Now tell me, wise man, which feather is it that I touch?“</p>
<p>“In sooth, Excellency, that I cannot.“</p>
<p>“Name of God, Bastard, Bastard! you cannot tell me this small thing,
yet are bold to name a large one–telling us what is in the stomach of
the unborn morrow: that we shall not have those men. Now it is my
thought that they will be with us.“</p>
<p>That made a stir. All wanted to know why she thought that. But La
Hire took the word and said:</p>
<p>“Let be. If she thinks it, that is enough. It will happen.“</p>
<p>Then Pothon of Santrailles said:</p>
<p>“There were other reasons for declining battle, according to the
saying of your Excellency?“</p>
<p>“Yes. One was that we being weak and the day far gone, the battle
might not be decisive. When it is fought it must be decisive. And it
shall be.“</p>
<p>“God grant it, and amen. There were still other reasons?“</p>
<p>“One other–yes.“ She hesitated a moment, then said: “This was not the
day. To-morrow is the day. It is so written.“</p>
<p>They were going to assail her with eager questionings, but she put up
her hand and prevented them. Then she said:</p>
<p>“It will be the most noble and beneficent victory that God has
vouchsafed for France at any time. I pray you question me not as to
whence or how I know this thing, but be content that it is so.“</p>
<p>There was pleasure in every face, and conviction and high confidence.
A murmur of conversation broke out, but that was interrupted by a
messenger from the outposts who brought news–namely, that for an hour
there had been stir and movement in the English camp of a sort unusual
at such a time and with a resting army, he said. Spies had been sent
under cover of the rain and darkness to inquire into it. They had just
come back and reported that large bodies of men had been dimly made out
who were slipping stealthily away in the direction of Meung.</p>
<p>The generals were very much surprised, as any might tell from their
faces.</p>
<p>“It is a retreat,“ said Joan.</p>
<p>“It has that look,“ said D’Alencon.</p>
<p>“It certainly has,“ observed the Bastard and La Hire.</p>
<p>“It was not to be expected,“ said Louis de Bourbon, “but one can
divine the purpose of it.“</p>
<p>“Yes,“ responded Joan. “Talbot has reflected. His rash brain has
cooled. He thinks to take the bridge of Meung and escape to the other
side of the river. He knows that this leaves his garrison of Beaugency
at the mercy of fortune, to escape our hands if it can; but there is no
other course if he would avoid this battle, and that he also knows. But
he shall not get the bridge. We will see to that.“</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said D’Alencon, “we must follow him, and take care of that
matter. What of Beaugency?“</p>
<p>“Leave Beaugency to me, gentle duke; I will have it in two hours, and
at no cost of blood.“</p>
<p>“It is true, Excellency. You will but need to deliver this news there
and receive the surrender.“</p>
<p>“Yes. And I will be with you at Meung with the dawn, fetching the
Constable and his fifteen hundred; and when Talbot knows that Beaugency
has fallen it will have an effect upon him.“</p>
<p>“By the mass, yes!“ cried La Hire. “He will join his Meung garrison
to his army and break for Paris. Then we shall have our bridge force
with us again, along with our Beaugency watchers, and be stronger for
our great day’s work by four-and-twenty hundred able soldiers, as was
here promised within the hour. Verily this Englishman is doing our
errands for us and saving us much blood and trouble. Orders,
Excellency–give us orders!“</p>
<p>“They are simple. Let the men rest three hours longer. At one o’clock
the advance-guard will march, under our command, with Pothon of
Saintrailles as second; the second division will follow at two under the
Lieutenant-General. Keep well in the rear of the enemy, and see to it
that you avoid an engagement. I will ride under guard to Beaugency and
make so quick work there that Ii and the Constable of France will join
you before dawn with his men.“</p>
<p>She kept her word. Her guard mounted and we rode off through the
puttering rain, taking with us a captured English officer to confirm
Joan’s news. We soon covered the journey and summoned the castle.
Richard Guetin, Talbot’s lieutenant, being convinced that he and his
five hundred men were left helpless, conceded that it would be useless
to try to hold out. He could not expect easy terms, yet Joan granted
them nevertheless. His garrison could keep their horses and arms, and
carry away property to the value of a silver mark per man. They could go
whither they pleased, but must not take arms against France again under
ten days.</p>
<p>Before dawn we were with our army again, and with us the Constable
and nearly all his men, for we left only a small garrison in Beaugency
castle. We heard the dull booming of cannon to the front, and knew that
Talbot was beginning his attack on the bridge. But some time before it
was yet light the sound ceased and we heard it no more.</p>
<p>Guetin had sent a messenger through our lines under a safe-conduct
given by Joan, to tell Talbot of the surrender. Of course this
poursuivant had arrived ahead of us. Talbot had held it wisdom to turn
now and retreat upon Paris. When daylight came he had disappeared; and
with him Lord Scales and the garrison of Meung.</p>
<p>What a harvest of English strongholds we had reaped in those three
days!–strongholds which had defied France with quite cool confidence and
plenty of it until we came.</p>
<p>30 The Red Field of Patay</p>
<p>WHEN THE morning broke at last on that forever memorable 18th of
June, thee was no enemy discoverable anywhere, as I have said. But that
did not trouble me. I knew we should find him, and that we should strike
him; strike him the promised blow–the one from which the English power
in France would not rise up in a thousand years, as Joan had said in her
trance.</p>
<p>The enemy had plunged into the wide plains of La Beauce–a roadless
waste covered with bushes, with here and there bodies of forest trees–a
region where an army would be hidden from view in a very little while.
We found the trail in the soft wet earth and followed it. It indicated
an orderly march; no confusion, no panic.</p>
<p>But we had to be cautious. In such a piece of country we could walk
into an ambush without any trouble. Therefore Joan sent bodies of
cavalry ahead under La Hire, Pothon, and other captains, to feel the
way. Some of the other officers began to show uneasiness; this sort of
hide-and-go-seek business troubled them and made their confidence a
little shaky. Joan divined their state of mind and cried out
impetuously:</p>
<p>“Name of God, what would you? We must smite these English, and we
will. They shall not escape us. Though they were hung to the clouds we
would get them!“</p>
<p>By and by we were nearing Patay; it was about a league away. Now at
this time our reconnaissance, feeling its way in the bush, frightened a
deer, and it went bounding away and was out of sight in a moment. Then
hardly a minute later a dull great shout went up in the distance toward
Patay. It was the English soldiery. They had been shut up in a garrison
so long on moldy food that they could not keep their delight to
themselves when this fine fresh meat came springing into their midst.
Poor creature, it had wrought damage to a nation which loved it well.
For the French knew where the English were now, whereas the English had
no suspicion of where the French were.</p>
<p>La Hire halted where he was, and sent back the tidings. Joan was
radiant with joy. The Duke d’Alencon said to her:</p>
<p>“Very well, we have found them; shall we fight them?“</p>
<p>“Have you good spurs, prince?“</p>
<p>“Why? Will they make us run away?“</p>
<p>“Nenni, en nom de Dieu! These English are ours–they are lost. They
will fly. Who overtakes them will need good spurs. Forward–close
up!“</p>
<p>By the time we had come up with La Hire the English had discovered
our presence. Talbot’s force was marching in three bodies. First his
advance-guard; then his artillery; then his battle-corps a good way in
the rear. He was now out of the bush and in a fair open country. He at
once posted his artillery, his advance-guard, and five hundred picked
archers along some hedges where the French would be obliged to pass, and
hoped to hold this position till his battle-corps could come up. Sir
John Fastolfe urged the battle-corps into a gallop. Joan saw her
opportunity and ordered La Hire to advance–which La Hire promptly did,
launching his wild riders like a storm-wind, his customary fashion.</p>
<p>The duke and the Bastard wanted to follow, but Joan said:</p>
<p>“Not yet–wait.“</p>
<p>So they waited–impatiently, and fidgeting in their saddles. But she
was ready–gazing straight before her, measuring, weighing,
calculating–by shades, minutes, fractions of minutes, seconds–with all
her great soul present, in eye, and set of head, and noble pose of
body–but patient, steady, master of herself–master of herself and of the
situation.</p>
<p>And yonder, receding, receding, plumes lifting and falling, lifting
and falling, streamed the thundering charge of La Hire’s godless crew,
La Hire’s great figure dominating it and his sword stretched aloft like
a flagstaff.</p>
<p>“Oh, Satan and his Hellions, see them go!“ Somebody muttered it in
deep admiration.</p>
<p>And now he was closing up–closing up on Fastolfe’s rushing corps.</p>
<p>And now he struck it–struck it hard, and broke its order. It lifted
the duke and the Bastard in their saddles to see it; and they turned,
trembling with excitement, to Joan, saying:</p>
<p>“Now!“</p>
<p>But she put up her hand, still gazing, weighing, calculating, and
said again:</p>
<p>“Wait–not yet.“</p>
<p>Fastolfe’s hard-driven battle-corps raged on like an avalanche toward
the waiting advance-guard. Suddenly these conceived the idea that it was
flying in panic before Joan; and so in that instant it broke and swarmed
away in a mad panic itself, with Talbot storming and cursing after
it.</p>
<p>Now was the golden time. Joan drove her spurs home and waved the
advance with her sword. “Follow me!“ she cried, and bent her head to her
horse’s neck and sped away like the wind!</p>
<p>We went down into the confusion of that flying rout, and for three
long hours we cut and hacked and stabbed. At last the bugles sang
“Halt!“</p>
<p>The Battle of Patay was won.</p>
<p>Joan of Arc dismounted, and stood surveying that awful field, lost in
thought. Presently she said:</p>
<p>“The praise is to God. He has smitten with a heavy hand this day.“
After a little she lifted her face, and looking afar off, said, with the
manner of one who is thinking aloud, “In a thousand years–a thousand
years–the English power in France will not rise up from this blow.“ She
stood again a time thinking, then she turned toward her grouped
generals, and there was a glory in her face and a noble light in her
eye; and she said:</p>
<p>“Oh, friends, friends, do you know?–do you comprehend? France is on
the way to be free!“</p>
<p>“And had never been, but for Joan of Arc!“ said La Hire, passing
before her and bowing low, the other following and doing likewise; he
muttering as he went, “I will say it though I be damned for it.“ Then
battalion after battalion of our victorious army swung by, wildly
cheering. And they shouted, “Live forever, Maid of Orleans, live
forever!“ while Joan, smiling, stood at the salute with her sword.</p>
<p>This was not the last time I saw the Maid of Orleans on the red field
of Patay. Toward the end of the day I came upon her where the dead and
dying lay stretched all about in heaps and winrows; our men had mortally
wounded an English prisoner who was too poor to pay a ransom, and from a
distance she had seen that cruel thing done; and had galloped to the
place and sent for a priest, and now she was holding the head of her
dying enemy in her lap, and easing him to his death with comforting soft
words, just as his sister might have done; and the womanly tears running
down her face all the time. [1]</p>
<p>[1] Lord Ronald Gower (Joan of Arc, p. 82) says: “Michelet discovered
this story in the deposition of Joan of Arc’s page, Louis de Conte, who
was probably an eye-witness of the scene.“ This is true. It was a part
of the testimony of the author of these “Personal Recollections of Joan
of Arc,“ given by him in the Rehabilitation proceedings of 1456.

<p>31 France Begins to Live Again</p>
<p>JOAN HAD said true: France was on the way to be free.</p>
<p>The war called the Hundred Years’ War was very sick to-day. Sick on
its English side–for the very first time since its birth, ninety-one
years gone by.</p>
<p>Shall we judge battles by the numbers killed and the ruin wrought? Or
shall we not rather judge them by the results which flowed from them?
Any one will say that a battle is only truly great or small according to
its results. Yes, any one will grant that, for it is the truth.</p>
<p>Judged by results, Patay’s place is with the few supremely great and
imposing battles that have been fought since the peoples of the world
first resorted to arms for the settlement of their quarrels. So judged,
it is even possible that Patay has no peer among that few just
mentioned, but stand alone, as the supremest of historic conflicts. For
when it began France lay gasping out the remnant of an exhausted life,
her case wholly hopeless in the view of all political physicians; when
it ended, three hours later, she was convalescent. Convalescent, and
nothing requisite but time and ordinary nursing to bring her back to
perfect health. The dullest physician of them all could see this, and
there was none to deny it.</p>
<p>Many death-sick nations have reached convalescence through a series
of battles, a procession of battles, a weary tale of wasting conflicts
stretching over years, but only one has reached it in a single day and
by a single battle. That nation is France, and that battle Patay.</p>
<p>Remember it and be proud of it; for you are French, and it is the
stateliest fact in the long annals of your country. There it stands,
with its head in the clouds! And when you grow up you will go on
pilgrimage to the field of Patay, and stand uncovered in the presence
of–what? A monument with its head in the clouds? Yes. For all nations in
all times have built monuments on their battle-fields to keep green the
memory of the perishable deed that was wrought there and of the
perishable name of him who wrought it; and will France neglect Patay and
Joan of Arc? Not for long. And will she build a monument scaled to their
rank as compared with the world’s other fields and heroes? Perhaps–if
there be room for it under the arch of the sky.</p>
<p>But let us look back a little, and consider certain strange and
impressive facts. The Hundred Years’ War began in 1337. It raged on and
on, year after year and year after year; and at last England stretched
France prone with that fearful blow at Crecy. But she rose and struggled
on, year after year, and at last again she went down under another
devastating blow–Poitiers. She gathered her crippled strength once more,
and the war raged on, and on, and still on, year after year, decade
after decade. Children were born, grew up, married, died–the war raged
on; their children in turn grew up, married, died–the war raged on;
their children, growing, saw France struck down again; this time under
the incredible disaster of Agincourt–and still the war raged on, year
after year, and in time these children married in their turn.</p>
<p>France was a wreck, a ruin, a desolation. The half of it belonged to
England, with none to dispute or deny the truth; the other half belonged
to nobody–in three months would be flying the English flag; the French
King was making ready to throw away his crown and flee beyond the
seas.</p>
<p>Now came the ignorant country-maid out of her remote village and
confronted this hoary war, this all-consuming conflagration that had
swept the land for three generations. Then began the briefest and most
amazing campaign that is recorded in history. In seven weeks it was
finished. In seven weeks she hopelessly crippled that gigantic war that
was ninety-one years old. At Orleans she struck it a staggering blow; on
the field of Patay she broke its back.</p>
<p>Think of it. Yes, one can do that; but understand it? Ah, that is
another matter; none will ever be able to comprehend that stupefying
marvel.</p>
<p>Seven weeks–with her and there a little bloodshed. Perhaps the most
of it, in any single fight, at Patay, where the English began six
thousand strong and left two thousand dead upon the field. It is said
and believed that in three battles alone–Crecy, Poitiers, and
Agincourt–near a hundred thousand Frenchmen fell, without counting the
thousand other fights of that long war. The dead of that war make a
mournful long list–an interminable list. Of men slain in the field the
count goes by tens of thousands; of innocent women and children slain by
bitter hardship and hunger it goes by that appalling term, millions.</p>
<p>It was an ogre, that war; an ogre that went about for near a hundred
years, crunching men and dripping blood from its jaws. And with her
little hand that child of seventeen struck him down; and yonder he lies
stretched on the field of Patay, and will not get up any more while this
old world lasts.</p>
<p>32 The Joyous News Flies Fast</p>
<p>THE GREAT news of Patay was carried over the whole of France in
twenty hours, people said. I do not know as to that; but one thing is
sure, anyway: the moment a man got it he flew shouting and glorifying
God and told his neighbor; and that neighbor flew with it to the next
homestead; and so on and so on without resting the word traveled; and
when a man got it in the night, at what hour soever, he jumped out of
his bed and bore the blessed message along. And the joy that went with
it was like the light that flows across the land when an eclipse is
receding from the face of the sun; and, indeed, you may say that France
had lain in an eclipse this long time; yes, buried in a black gloom
which these beneficent tidings were sweeping away now before the onrush
of their white splendor.</p>
<p>The news beat the flying enemy to Yeuville, and the town rose against
its English masters and shut the gates against their brethren. It flew
to Mont Pipeau, to Saint Simon, and to this, that, and the other English
fortress; and straightway the garrison applied the torch and took to the
fields and the woods. A detachment of our army occupied Meung and
pillaged it.</p>
<p>When we reached Orleans that tow was as much as fifty times insaner
with joy than we had ever seen it before–which is saying much. Night had
just fallen, and the illuminations were on so wonderful a scale that we
seemed to plow through seas of fire; and as to the noise–the hoarse
cheering of the multitude, the thundering of cannon, the clash of
bells–indeed, there was never anything like it. And everywhere rose a
new cry that burst upon us like a storm when the column entered the
gates, and nevermore ceased: “Welcome to Joan of Arc–way for the SAVIOR
OF FRANCE!“ And there was another cry: “Crecy is avenged! Poitiers is
avenged! Agincourt is avenged!–Patay shall live forever!“</p>
<p>Mad? Why, you never could imagine it in the world. The prisoners were
in the center of the column. When that came along and the people caught
sight of their masterful old enemy Talbot, that had made them dance so
long to his grim war-music, you may imagine what the uproar was like if
you can, for I can not describe it. They were so glad to see him that
presently they wanted to have him out and hang him; so Joan had him
brought up to the front to ride in her protection. They made a striking
pair.</p>
<p>33 Joan’s Five Great Deeds</p>
<p>YES, ORLEANS was in a delirium of felicity. She invited the King, and
made sumptuous preparations to receive him, but–he didn’t come. He was
simply a serf at that time, and La Tremouille was his master. Master and
serf were visiting together at the master’s castle of
Sully-sur-Loire.</p>
<p>At Beaugency Joan had engaged to bring about a reconciliation between
the Constable Richemont and the King. She took Richemont to
Sully-sur-Loire and made her promise good.</p>
<p>The great deeds of Joan of Arc are five:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Raising of the Siege.</p></li>
<li><p>The Victory of Patay.</p></li>
<li><p>The Reconciliation at Sully-sur-Loire.</p></li>
<li><p>The Coronation of the King.</p></li>
<li><p>The Bloodless March.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We shall come to the Bloodless March presently (and the Coronation).
It was the victorious long march which Joan made through the enemy’s
country from Gien to Rheims, and thence to the gates of Paris, capturing
every English town and fortress that barred the road, from the beginning
of the journey to the end of it; and this by the mere force of her name,
and without shedding a drop of blood–perhaps the most extraordinary
campaign in this regard in history–this is the most glorious of her
military exploits.</p>
<p>The Reconciliation was one of Joan’s most important achievements. No
one else could have accomplished it; and, in fact, no one else of high
consequence had any disposition to try. In brains, in scientific
warfare, and in statesmanship the Constable Richemont was the ablest man
in France. His loyalty was sincere; his probity was above suspicion–(and
it made him sufficiently conspicuous in that trivial and conscienceless
Court).</p>
<p>In restoring Richemont to France, Joan made thoroughly secure the
successful completion of the great work which she had begun. She had
never seen Richemont until he came to her with his little army. Was it
not wonderful that at a glance she should know him for the one man who
could finish and perfect her work and establish it in perpetuity? How
was it that that child was able to do this? It was because she had the
“seeing eye,“ as one of our knights had once said. Yes, she had that
great gift–almost the highest and rarest that has been granted to man.
Nothing of an extraordinary sort was still to be done, yet the remaining
work could not safely be left to the King’s idiots; for it would require
wise statesmanship and long and patient though desultory hammering of
the enemy. Now and then, for a quarter of a century yet, there would be
a little fighting to do, and a handy man could carry that on with small
disturbance to the rest of the country; and little by little, and with
progressive certainty, the English would disappear from France.</p>
<p>And that happened. Under the influence of Richemont the King became
at a later time a man–a man, a king, a brave and capable and determined
soldier. Within six years after Patay he was leading storming parties
himself; fighting in fortress ditches up to his waist in water, and
climbing scaling-ladders under a furious fire with a pluck that would
have satisfied even Joan of Arc. In time he and Richemont cleared away
all the English; even from regions where the people had been under their
mastership for three hundred years. In such regions wise and careful
work was necessary, for the English rule had been fair and kindly; and
men who have been ruled in that way are not always anxious for a
change.</p>
<p>Which of Joan’s five chief deeds shall we call the chiefest? It is my
thought that each in its turn was that. This is saying that, taken as a
whole, they equalized each other, and neither was then greater than its
mate.</p>
<p>Do you perceive? Each was a stage in an ascent. To leave out one of
them would defeat the journey; to achieve one of them at the wrong time
and in the wrong place would have the same effect.</p>
<p>Consider the Coronation. As a masterpiece of diplomacy, where can you
find its superior in our history? Did the King suspect its vast
importance? No. Did his ministers? No. Did the astute Bedford,
representative of the English crown? No. An advantage of incalculable
importance was here under the eyes of the King and of Bedford; the King
could get it by a bold stroke, Bedford could get it without an effort;
but, being ignorant of its value, neither of them put forth his hand. Of
all the wise people in high office in France, only one knew the
priceless worth of this neglected prize–the untaught child of seventeen,
Joan of Arc–and she had known it from the beginning as an essential
detail of her mission.</p>
<p>How did she know it? It was simple: she was a peasant. That tells the
whole story. She was of the people and knew the people; those others
moved in a loftier sphere and knew nothing much about them. We make
little account of that vague, formless, inert mass, that mighty
underlying force which we call “the people“–an epithet which carries
contempt with it. It is a strange attitude; for at bottom we know that
the throne which the people support stands, and that when that support
is removed nothing in this world can save it.</p>
<p>Now, then, consider this fact, and observe its importance. Whatever
the parish priest believes his flock believes; they love him, they
revere him; he is their unfailing friend, their dauntless protector,
their comforter in sorrow, their helper in their day of need; he has
their whole confidence; what he tells them to do, that they will do,
with a blind and affectionate obedience, let it cost what it may. Add
these facts thoughtfully together, and what is the sum? This: The parish
priest governs the nation. What is the King, then, if the parish priest
withdraws his support and deny his authority? Merely a shadow and no
King; let him resign.</p>
<p>Do you get that idea? Then let us proceed. A priest is consecrated to
his office by the awful hand of God, laid upon him by his appointed
representative on earth. That consecration is final; nothing can undo
it, nothing can remove it. Neither the Pope nor any other power can
strip the priest of his office; God gave it, and it is forever sacred
and secure. The dull parish knows all this. To priest and parish,
whatsoever is anointed of God bears an office whose authority can no
longer be disputed or assailed. To the parish priest, and to his
subjects the nation, an uncrowned king is a similitude of a person who
has been named for holy orders but has not been consecrated; he has no
office, he has not been ordained, another may be appointed to his place.
In a word, an uncrowned king is a doubtful king; but if God appoint him
and His servant the Bishop anoint him, the doubt is annihilated; the
priest and the parish are his loyal subjects straightway, and while he
lives they will recognize no king but him.</p>
<p>To Joan of Arc, the peasant-girl, Charles VII. was no King until he
was crowned; to her he was only the Dauphin; that is to say, the heir.
If I have ever made her call him King, it was a mistake; she called him
the Dauphin, and nothing else until after the Coronation. It shows you
as in a mirror–for Joan was a mirror in which the lowly hosts of France
were clearly reflected–that to all that vast underlying force called
“the people,“ he was no King but only Dauphin before his crowning, and
was indisputably and irrevocably King after it.</p>
<p>Now you understand what a colossal move on the political chess-board
the Coronation was. Bedford realized this by and by, and tried to patch
up his mistake by crowning his King; but what good could that do? None
in the world.</p>
<p>Speaking of chess, Joan’s great acts may be likened to that game.
Each move was made in its proper order, and it as great and effective
because it was made in its proper order and not out of it. Each, at the
time made, seemed the greatest move; but the final result made them all
recognizable as equally essential and equally important. This is the
game, as played:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Joan moves to Orleans and Patay–check.</p></li>
<li><p>Then moves the Reconciliation–but does not proclaim check, it
being a move for position, and to take effect later.</p></li>
<li><p>Next she moves the Coronation–check.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, the Bloodless March–check.</p></li>
<li><p>Final move (after her death), the reconciled Constable Richemont
to the French King’s elbow–checkmate.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>34 The Jests of the Burgundians</p>
<p>THE CAMPAIGN of the Loire had as good as opened the road to Rheims.
There was no sufficient reason now why the Coronation should not take
place. The Coronation would complete the mission which Joan had received
from heaven, and then she would be forever done with war, and would fly
home to her mother and her sheep, and never stir from the hearthstone
and happiness any more. That was her dream; and she could not rest, she
was so impatient to see it fulfilled. She became so possessed with this
matter that I began to lose faith in her two prophecies of her early
death–and, of course, when I found that faith wavering I encouraged it
to waver all the more.</p>
<p>The King was afraid to start to Rheims, because the road was
mile-posted with English fortresses, so to speak. Joan held them in
light esteem and not things to be afraid of in the existing modified
condition of English confidence.</p>
<p>And she was right. As it turned out, the march to Rheims was nothing
but a holiday excursion: Joan did not even take any artillery along, she
was so sure it would not be necessary. We marched from Gien twelve
thousand strong. This was the 29th of June. The Maid rode by the side of
the King; on his other side was the Duke d’Alencon. After the duke
followed three other princes of the blood. After these followed the
Bastard of Orleans, the Marshal de Boussac, and the Admiral of France.
After these came La Hire, Saintrailles, Tremouille, and a long
procession of knights and nobles.</p>
<p>We rested three days before Auxerre. The city provisioned the army,
and a deputation waited upon the King, but we did not enter the
place.</p>
<p>Saint-Florentin opened its gates to the King.</p>
<p>On the 4th of July we reached Saint-Fal, and yonder lay Troyes before
us–a town which had a burning interest for us boys; for we remembered
how seven years before, in the pastures of Domremy, the Sunflower came
with his black flag and brought us the shameful news of the Treaty of
Troyes–that treaty which gave France to England, and a daughter of our
royal line in marriage to the Butcher of Agincourt. That poor town was
not to blame, of course; yet we flushed hot with that old memory, and
hoped there would be a misunderstanding here, for we dearly wanted to
storm the place and burn it. It was powerfully garrisoned by English and
Burgundian soldiery, and was expecting reinforcements from Paris. Before
night we camped before its gates and made rough work with a sortie which
marched out against us.</p>
<p>Joan summoned Troyes to surrender. Its commandant, seeing that she
had no artillery, scoffed at the idea, and sent her a grossly insulting
reply. Five days we consulted and negotiated. No result. The King was
about to turn back now and give up. He was afraid to go on, leaving this
strong place in his rear. Then La Hire put in a word, with a slap in it
for some of his Majesty’s advisers:</p>
<p>“The Maid of Orleans undertook this expedition of her own motion; and
it is my mind that it is her judgment that should be followed here, and
not that of any other, let him be of whatsoever breed and standing he
may.“</p>
<p>There was wisdom and righteousness in that. So the King sent for the
Maid, and asked her how she thought the prospect looked. She said,
without any tone of doubt or question in her voice:</p>
<p>“In three days’ time the place is ours.“</p>
<p>The smug Chancellor put in a word now:</p>
<p>“If we were sure of it we would wait her six days.“</p>
<p>“Six days, forsooth! Name of God, man, we will enter the gates
to-morrow!“</p>
<p>Then she mounted, and rode her lines, crying out:</p>
<p>“Make preparation–to your work, friends, to your work! We assault at
dawn!“</p>
<p>She worked hard that night, slaving away with her own hands like a
common soldier. She ordered fascines and fagots to be prepared and
thrown into the fosse, thereby to bridge it; and in this rough labor she
took a man’s share.</p>
<p>At dawn she took her place at the head of the storming force and the
bugles blew the assault. At that moment a flag of truce was flung to the
breeze from the walls, and Troyes surrendered without firing a shot.</p>
<p>The next day the King with Joan at his side and the Paladin bearing
her banner entered the town in state at the head of the army. And a
goodly army it was now, for it had been growing ever bigger and bigger
from the first.</p>
<p>And now a curious thing happened. By the terms of the treaty made
with the town the garrison of English and Burgundian soldiery were to be
allowed to carry away their “goods“ with them. This was well, for
otherwise how would they buy the wherewithal to live? Very well; these
people were all to go out by the one gate, and at the time set for them
to depart we young fellows went to that gate, along with the Dwarf, to
see the march-out. Presently here they came in an interminable file, the
foot-soldiers in the lead. As they approached one could see that each
bore a burden of a bulk and weight to sorely tax his strength; and we
said among ourselves, truly these folk are well off for poor common
soldiers. When they were come nearer, what do you think? Every rascal of
them had a French prisoner on his back! They were carrying away their
“goods,“ you see–their property–strictly according to the permission
granted by the treaty.</p>
<p>Now think how clever that was, how ingenious. What could a body say?
what could a body do? For certainly these people were within their
right. These prisoners were property; nobody could deny that. My dears,
if those had been English captives, conceive of the richness of that
booty! For English prisoners had been scarce and precious for a hundred
years; whereas it was a different matter with French prisoners. They had
been over-abundant for a century. The possessor of a French prisoner did
not hold him long for ransom, as a rule, but presently killed him to
save the cost of his keep. This shows you how small was the value of
such a possession in those times. When we took Troyes a calf was worth
thirty francs, a sheep sixteen, a French prisoner eight. It was an
enormous price for those other animals–a price which naturally seems
incredible to you. It was the war, you see. It worked two ways: it made
meat dear and prisoners cheap.</p>
<p>Well, here were these poor Frenchmen being carried off. What could we
do? Very little of a permanent sort, but we did what we could. We sent a
messenger flying to Joan, and we and the French guards halted the
procession for a parley–to gain time, you see. A big Burgundian lost his
temper and swore a great oath that none should stop him; he would go,
and would take his prisoner with him. But we blocked him off, and he saw
that he was mistaken about going–he couldn’t do it. He exploded into the
maddest cursings and revilings, then, and, unlashing his prisoner from
his back, stood him up, all bound and helpless; then drew his knife, and
said to us with a light of sarcasting triumph in his eye:</p>
<p>“I may not carry him away, you say–yet he is mine, none will dispute
it. Since I may not convey him hence, this property of mine, there is
another way. Yes, I can kill him; not even the dullest among you will
question that right. Ah, you had not thought of that–vermin!“</p>
<p>That poor starved fellow begged us with his piteous eyes to save him;
then spoke, and said he had a wife and little children at home. Think
how it wrung our heartstrings. But what could we do? The Burgundian was
within his right. We could only beg and plead for the prisoner. Which we
did. And the Burgundian enjoyed it. He stayed his hand to hear more of
it, and laugh at it. That stung. Then the Dwarf said:</p>
<p>“Prithee, young sirs, let me beguile him; for when a matter requiring
permission is to the fore, I have indeed a gift in that sort, as any
will tell you that know me well. You smile; and that is punishment for
my vanity; and fairly earned, I grant you. Still, if I may toy a little,
just a little–“ saying which he stepped to the Burgundian and began a
fair soft speech, all of goodly and gentle tenor; and in the midst he
mentioned the Maid; and was going on to say how she out of her good
heart would prize and praise this compassionate deed which he was about
to– It was as far as he got. The Burgundian burst into his smooth
oration with an insult leveled at Joan of Arc. We sprang forward, but
the Dwarf, his face all livid, brushed us aside and said, in a most
grave and earnest way:</p>
<p>“I crave your patience. Am not I her guard of honor? This is my
affair.“</p>
<p>And saying this he suddenly shot his right hand out and gripped the
great Burgundian by the throat, and so held him upright on his feet.
“You have insulted the Maid,“ he said; “and the Maid is France. The
tongue that does that earns a long furlough.“</p>
<p>One heard the muffled cracking of bones. The Burgundian’s eyes began
to protrude from their sockets and stare with a leaden dullness at
vacancy. The color deepened in his face and became an opaque purple. His
hands hung down limp, his body collapsed with a shiver, every muscle
relaxed its tension and ceased from its function. The Dwarf took away
his hand and the column of inert mortality sank mushily to the
ground.</p>
<p>We struck the bonds from the prisoner and told him he was free. His
crawling humbleness changed to frantic joy in a moment, and his ghastly
fear to a childish rage. He flew at that dead corpse and kicked it, spat
in its face, danced upon it, crammed mud into its mouth, laughing,
jeering, cursing, and volleying forth indecencies and bestialities like
a drunken fiend. It was a thing to be expected; soldiering makes few
saints. Many of the onlookers laughed, others were indifferent, none was
surprised. But presently in his mad caperings the freed man capered
within reach of the waiting file, and another Burgundian promptly
slipped a knife through his neck, and down he went with a death-shriek,
his brilliant artery blood spurting ten feet as straight and bright as a
ray of light. There was a great burst of jolly laughter all around from
friend and foe alike; and thus closed one of the pleasantest incidents
of my checkered military life.</p>
<p>And now came Joan hurrying, and deeply troubled. She considered the
claim of the garrison, then said:</p>
<p>“You have right upon your side. It is plain. It was a careless word
to put in the treaty, and covers too much. But ye may not take these
poor men away. They are French, and I will not have it. The King shall
ransom them, every one. Wait till I send you word from him; and hurt no
hair of their heads; for I tell you, I who speak, that that would cost
you very dear.“</p>
<p>That settled it. The prisoners were safe for one while, anyway. Then
she rode back eagerly and required that thing of the King, and would
listen to no paltering and no excuses. So the King told her to have her
way, and she rode straight back and bought the captives free in his name
and let them go.</p>
<p>35 The Heir of France is Crowned</p>
<p>IT WAS here hat we saw again the Grand Master of the King’s
Household, in whose castle Joan was guest when she tarried at Chinon in
those first days of her coming out of her own country. She made him
Bailiff of Troyes now by the King’s permission.</p>
<p>And now we marched again; Chalons surrendered to us; and there by
Chalons in a talk, Joan, being asked if she had no fears for the future,
said yes, one–treachery. Who would believe it? who could dream it? And
yet in a sense it was prophecy. Truly, man is a pitiful animal.</p>
<p>We marched, marched, kept on marching; and at last, on the 16th of
July, we came in sight of our goal, and saw the great cathedraled towers
of Rheims rise out of the distance! Huzza after huzza swept the army
from van to rear; and as for Joan of Arc, there where she sat her horse
gazing, clothed all in white armor, dreamy, beautiful, and in her face a
deep, deep joy, a joy not of earth, oh, she was not flesh, she was a
spirit! Her sublime mission was closing–closing in flawless triumph.
To-morrow she could say, “It is finished–let me go free.“</p>
<p>We camped, and the hurry and rush and turmoil of the grand
preparations began. The Archbishop and a great deputation arrived; and
after these came flock after flock, crowd after crowd, of citizens and
country-folk, hurrahing, in, with banners and music, and flowed over the
camp, one rejoicing inundation after another, everybody drunk with
happiness. And all night long Rheims was hard at work, hammering away,
decorating the town, building triumphal arches and clothing the ancient
cathedral within and without in a glory of opulent splendors.</p>
<p>We moved betimes in the morning; the coronation ceremonies would
begin at nine and last five hours. We were aware that the garrison of
English and Burgundian soldiers had given up all thought of resisting
the Maid, and that we should find the gates standing hospitably open and
the whole city ready to welcome us with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>It was a delicious morning, brilliant with sunshine, but cool and
fresh and inspiring. The army was in great form, and fine to see, as it
uncoiled from its lair fold by fold, and stretched away on the final
march of the peaceful Coronation Campaign.</p>
<p>Joan, on her black horse, with the Lieutenant-General and the
personal staff grouped about her, took post for a final review and a
good-by; for she was not expecting to ever be a soldier again, or ever
serve with these or any other soldiers any more after this day. The army
knew this, and believed it was looking for the last time upon the
girlish face of its invincible little Chief, its pet, its pride, its
darling, whom it had ennobled in its private heart with nobilities of
its own creation, call her “Daughter of God,“ “Savior of France,“
“Victory’s Sweetheart,“ “The Page of Christ,“ together with still softer
titles which were simply naive and frank endearments such as men are
used to confer upon children whom they love. And so one saw a new thing
now; a thing bred of the emotion that was present there on both sides.
Always before, in the march-past, the battalions had gone swinging by in
a storm of cheers, heads up and eyes flashing, the drums rolling, the
bands braying p’ans of victory; but now there was nothing of that. But
for one impressive sound, one could have closed his eyes and imagined
himself in a world of the dead. That one sound was all that visited the
ear in the summer stillness–just that one sound–the muffled tread of the
marching host. As the serried masses drifted by, the men put their right
hands up to their temples, palms to the front, in military salute,
turning their eyes upon Joan’s face in mute God-bless-you and farewell,
and keeping them there while they could. They still kept their hands up
in reverent salute many steps after they had passed by. Every time Joan
put her handkerchief to her eyes you could see a little quiver of
emotion crinkle along the faces of the files.</p>
<p>The march-past after a victory is a thing to drive the heart mad with
jubilation; but this one was a thing to break it.</p>
<p>We rode now to the King’s lodgings, which was the Archbishop’s
country palace; and he was presently ready, and we galloped off and took
position at the head of the army. By this time the country-people were
arriving in multitudes from every direction and massing themselves on
both sides of the road to get sight of Joan–just as had been done every
day since our first day’s march began. Our march now lay through the
grassy plain, and those peasants made a dividing double border for that
plain. They stretched right down through it, a broad belt of bright
colors on each side of the road; for every peasant girl and woman in it
had a white jacket on her body and a crimson skirt on the rest of her.
Endless borders made of poppies and lilies stretching away in front of
us–that is what it looked like. And that is the kind of lane we had been
marching through all these days. Not a lane between multitudinous
flowers standing upright on their stems–no, these flowers were always
kneeling; kneeling, these human flowers, with their hands and faces
lifted toward Joan of Arc, and the grateful tears streaming down. And
all along, those closest to the road hugged her feet and kissed them and
laid their wet cheeks fondly against them. I never, during all those
days, saw any of either sex stand while she passed, nor any man keep his
head covered. Afterward in the Great Trial these touching scenes were
used as a weapon against her. She had been made an object of adoration
by the people, and this was proof that she was a heretic–so claimed that
unjust court.</p>
<p>As we drew near the city the curving long sweep of ramparts and
towers was gay with fluttering flags and black with masses of people;
and all the air was vibrant with the crash of artillery and gloomed with
drifting clouds of smoke. We entered the gates in state and moved in
procession through the city, with all the guilds and industries in
holiday costume marching in our rear with their banners; and all the
route was hedged with a huzzaing crush of people, and all the windows
were full and all the roofs; and from the balconies hung costly stuffs
of rich colors; and the waving of handkerchiefs, seen in perspective
through a long vista, was like a snowstorm.</p>
<p>Joan’s name had been introduced into the prayers of the Church–an
honor theretofore restricted to royalty. But she had a dearer honor and
an honor more to be proud of, from a humbler source: the common people
had had leaden medals struck which bore her effigy and her escutcheon,
and these they wore as charms. One saw them everywhere.</p>
<p>From the Archbishop’s Palace, where we halted, and where the King and
Joan were to lodge, the King sent to the Abbey Church of St. Remi, which
was over toward the gate by which we had entered the city, for the
Sainte Ampoule, or flask of holy oil. This oil was not earthly oil; it
was made in heaven; the flask also. The flask, with the oil in it, was
brought down from heaven by a dove. It was sent down to St. Remi just as
he was going to baptize King Clovis, who had become a Christian. I know
this to be true. I had known it long before; for Pere Fronte told me in
Domremy. I cannot tell you how strange and awful it made me feel when I
saw that flask and knew I was looking with my own eyes upon a thing
which had actually been in heave, a thing which had been seen by angels,
perhaps; and by God Himself of a certainty, for He sent it. And I was
looking upon it–I. At one time I could have touched it. But I was
afraid; for I could not know but that God had touched it. It is most
probable that He had.</p>
<p>From this flask Clovis had been anointed; and from it all the kings
of France had been anointed since. Yes, ever since the time of Clovis,
and that was nine hundred years. And so, as I have said, that flask of
holy oil was sent for, while we waited. A coronation without that would
not have been a coronation at all, in my belief.</p>
<p>Now in order to get the flask, a most ancient ceremonial had to be
gone through with; otherwise the Abb, of St. Remi, hereditary guardian
in perpetuity of the oil, would not deliver it. So, in accordance with
custom, the King deputed five great nobles to ride in solemn state and
richly armed and accoutered, they and their steeds, to the Abbey Church
as a guard of honor to the Archbishop of Rheims and his canons, who were
to bear the King’s demand for the oil. When the five great lords were
ready to start, they knelt in a row and put up their mailed hands before
their faces, palm joined to palm, and swore upon their lives to conduct
the sacred vessel safely, and safely restore it again to the Church of
St. Remi after the anointing of the King. The Archbishop and his
subordinates, thus nobly escorted, took their way to St. Remi. The
Archbishop was in grand costume, with his miter on his head and his
cross in his hand. At the door of St. Remi they halted and formed, to
receive the holy vial. Soon one heard the deep tones of the organ and of
chanting men; then one saw a long file of lights approaching through the
dim church. And so came the Abbot, in his sacerdotal panoply, bearing
the vial, with his people following after. He delivered it, with solemn
ceremonies, to the Archbishop; then the march back began, and it was
most impressive; for it moved, the whole way, between two multitudes of
men and women who lay flat upon their faces and prayed in dumb silence
and in dread while that awful thing went by that had been in heaven.</p>
<p>This August company arrived at the great west door of the cathedral;
and as the Archbishop entered a noble anthem rose and filled the vast
building. The cathedral was packed with people–people in thousands. Only
a wide space down the center had been kept free. Down this space walked
the Archbishop and his canons, and after them followed those five
stately figures in splendid harness, each bearing his feudal banner–and
riding!</p>
<p>Oh, that was a magnificent thing to see. Riding down the cavernous
vastness of the building through the rich lights streaming in long rays
from the pictured windows–oh, there was never anything so grand!</p>
<p>They rode clear to the choir–as much as four hundred feet from the
door, it was said. Then the Archbishop dismissed them, and they made
deep obeisance till their plumes touched their horses’ necks, then made
those proud prancing and mincing and dancing creatures go backward all
the way to the door–which was pretty to see, and graceful; then they
stood them on their hind-feet and spun them around and plunged away and
disappeared.</p>
<p>For some minutes there was a deep hush, a waiting pause; a silence so
profound that it was as if all those packed thousands there were steeped
in dreamless slumber–why, you could even notice the faintest sounds,
like the drowsy buzzing of insects; then came a mighty flood of rich
strains from four hundred silver trumpets, and then, framed in the
pointed archway of the great west door, appeared Joan and the King. They
advanced slowly, side by side, through a tempest of welcome–explosion
after explosion of cheers and cries, mingled with the deep thunders of
the organ and rolling tides of triumphant song from chanting choirs.
Behind Joan and the King came the Paladin and the Banner displayed; and
a majestic figure he was, and most proud and lofty in his bearing, for
he knew that the people were marking him and taking note of the gorgeous
state dress which covered his armor.</p>
<p>At his side was the Sire d’Albret, proxy for the Constable of France,
bearing the Sword of State.</p>
<p>After these, in order of rank, came a body royally attired
representing the lay peers of France; it consisted of three princes of
the blood, and La Tremouille and the young De Laval brothers.</p>
<p>These were followed by the representatives of the ecclesiastical
peers–the Archbishop of Rheims, and the Bishops of Laon, Chalons,
Orleans, and one other.</p>
<p>Behind these came the Grand Staff, all our great generals and famous
names, and everybody was eager to get a sight of them. Through all the
din one could hear shouts all along that told you where two of them
were: “Live the Bastard of Orleans!“ “Satan La Hire forever!“</p>
<p>The August procession reached its appointed place in time, and the
solemnities of the Coronation began. They were long and imposing–with
prayers, and anthems, and sermons, and everything that is right for such
occasions; and Joan was at the King’s side all these hours, with her
Standard in her hand. But at last came the grand act: the King took the
oath, he was anointed with the sacred oil; a splendid personage,
followed by train-bearers and other attendants, approached, bearing the
Crown of France upon a cushion, and kneeling offered it. The King seemed
to hesitate–in fact, did hesitate; for he put out his hand and then
stopped with it there in the air over the crown, the fingers in the
attitude of taking hold of it. But that was for only a moment–though a
moment is a notable something when it stops the heartbeat of twenty
thousand people and makes them catch their breath. Yes, only a moment;
then he caught Joan’s eye, and she gave him a look with all the joy of
her thankful great soul in it; then he smiled, and took the Crown of
France in his hand, and right finely and right royally lifted it up and
set it upon his head.</p>
<p>Then what a crash there was! All about us cries and cheers, and the
chanting of the choirs and groaning of the organ; and outside the
clamoring of the bells and the booming of the cannon. The fantastic
dream, the incredible dream, the impossible dream of the peasant-child
stood fulfilled; the English power was broken, the Heir of France was
crowned.</p>
<p>She was like one transfigured, so divine was the joy that shone in
her face as she sank to her knees at the King’s feet and looked up at
him through her tears. Her lips were quivering, and her words came soft
and low and broken:</p>
<p>“Now, O gentle King, is the pleasure of God accomplished according to
His command that you should come to Rheims and receive the crown that
belongeth of right to you, and unto none other. My work which was given
me to do is finished; give me your peace, and let me go back to my
mother, who is poor and old, and has need of me.“</p>
<p>The King raised her up, and there before all that host he praised her
great deeds in most noble terms; and there he confirmed her nobility and
titles, making her the equal of a count in rank, and also appointed a
household and officers for her according to her dignity; and then he
said:</p>
<p>“You have saved the crown. Speak–require–demand; and whatsoever grace
you ask it shall be granted, though it make the kingdom poor to meet
it.“</p>
<p>Now that was fine, that was royal. Joan was on her knees again
straightway, and said:</p>
<p>“Then, O gentle King, if out of your compassion you will speak the
word, I pray you give commandment that my village, poor and hard pressed
by reason of war, may have its taxes remitted.“</p>
<p>“It is so commanded. Say on.“</p>
<p>“That is all.“</p>
<p>“All? Nothing but that?“</p>
<p>“It is all. I have no other desire.“</p>
<p>“But that is nothing–less than nothing. Ask–do not be afraid.“</p>
<p>“Indeed, I cannot, gentle King. Do not press me. I will not have
aught else, but only this alone.“</p>
<p>The King seemed nonplussed, and stood still a moment, as if trying to
comprehend and realize the full stature of this strange unselfishness.
Then he raised his head and said:</p>
<p>“Who has won a kingdom and crowned its King; and all she asks and all
she will take is this poor grace–and even this is for others, not for
herself. And it is well; her act being proportioned to the dignity of
one who carries in her head and heart riches which outvalue any that any
King could add, though he gave his all. She shall have her way. Now,
therefore, it is decreed that from this day forth Domremy, natal village
of Joan of Arc, Deliverer of France, called the Maid of Orleans, is
freed from all taxation forever.“ Whereat the silver horns blew a
jubilant blast.</p>
<p>There, you see, she had had a vision of this very scene the time she
was in a trance in the pastures of Domremy and we asked her to name to
boon she would demand of the King if he should ever chance to tell her
she might claim one. But whether she had the vision or not, this act
showed that after all the dizzy grandeurs that had come upon her, she
was still the same simple, unselfish creature that she was that day.</p>
<p>Yes, Charles VII. remitted those taxes “forever.“ Often the gratitude
of kings and nations fades and their promises are forgotten or
deliberately violated; but you, who are children of France, should
remember with pride that France has kept this one faithfully.
Sixty-three years have gone by since that day. The taxes of the region
wherein Domremy lies have been collected sixty-three times since then,
and all the villages of that region have paid except that one–Domremy.
The tax-gatherer never visits Domremy. Domremy has long ago forgotten
what that dread sorrow-sowing apparition is like. Sixty-three tax-books
have been filed meantime, and they lie yonder with the other public
records, and any may see them that desire it. At the top of every page
in the sixty-three books stands the name of a village, and below that
name its weary burden of taxation is figured out and displayed; in the
case of all save one. It is true, just as I tell you. In each of the
sixty-three books there is a page headed “Domremi,“ but under that name
not a figure appears. Where the figures should be, there are three words
written; and the same words have been written every year for all these
years; yes, it is a blank page, with always those grateful words
lettered across the face of it–a touching memorial. Thus:</p>
<p>__________________________________ | | | DOMREMI | | | |</p>
<p>RIEN–LA PUCELLE | |__________________________________|</p>
<p>“NOTHING–THE MAID OF ORLEANS.“</p>
<p>How brief it is; yet how much it says! It is the nation speaking. You
have the spectacle of that unsentimental thing, a Government, making
reverence to that name and saying to its agent, “Uncover, and pass on;
it is France that commands.“ Yes, the promise has been kept; it will be
kept always; “forever“ was the King’s word. [1] At two o’clock in the
afternoon the ceremonies of the Coronation came at last to an end; then
the procession formed once more, with Joan and the King at its head, and
took up its solemn march through the midst of the church, all
instruments and all people making such clamor of rejoicing noises as
was, indeed, a marvel to hear. An so ended the third of the great days
of Joan’s life. And how close together they stand–May 8th, June 18th,
July 17th!</p>
<p>[1] IT was faithfully kept during three hundred and sixty years and
more; then the over-confident octogenarian’s prophecy failed. During the
tumult of the French Revolution the promise was forgotten and the grace
withdrawn. It has remained in disuse ever since. Joan never asked to be
remembered, but France has remembered her with an inextinguishable love
and reverence; Joan never asked for a statue, but France has lavished
them upon her; Joan never asked for a church for Domremy, but France is
building one; Joan never asked for saintship, but even that is
impending. Everything which Joan of Arc did not ask for has been given
her, and with a noble profusion; but the one humble little thing which
she did ask for and get has been taken away from her. There is something
infinitely pathetic about this. France owes Domremy a hundred years of
taxes, and could hardly find a citizen within her borders who would vote
against the payment of the debt. – NOTE BY THE TRANSLATOR.</p>
<p>36 Joan Hears News from Home</p>
<p>WE MOUNTED and rode, a spectacle to remember, a most noble display of
rich vestments and nodding plumes, and as we moved between the banked
multitudes they sank down all along abreast of us as we advanced, like
grain before the reaper, and kneeling hailed with a rousing welcome the
consecrated King and his companion the Deliverer of France. But by and
by when we had paraded about the chief parts of the city and were come
near to the end of our course, we being now approaching the Archbishop’s
palace, one saw on the right, hard by the inn that is called the Zebra,
a strange t–two men not kneeling but standing! Standing in the front
rank of the kneelers; unconscious, transfixed, staring. Yes, and clothed
in the coarse garb of the peasantry, these two. Two halberdiers sprang
at them in a fury to teach them better manners; but just as they seized
them Joan cried out “Forbear!“ and slid from her saddle and flung her
arms about one of those peasants, calling him by all manner of endearing
names, and sobbing. For it was her father; and the other was her uncle,
Laxart.</p>
<p>The news flew everywhere, and shouts of welcome were raised, and in
just one little moment those two despised and unknown plebeians were
become famous and popular and envied, and everybody was in a fever to
get sight of them and be able to say, all their lives long, that they
had seen the father of Joan of Arc and the brother of her mother. How
easy it was for her to do miracles like to this! She was like the sun;
on whatsoever dim and humble object her rays fell, that thing was
straightway drowned in glory.</p>
<p>All graciously the King said:</p>
<p>“Bring them to me.“</p>
<p>And she brought them; she radiant with happiness and affection, they
trembling and scared, with their caps in their shaking hands; and there
before all the world the King gave them his hand to kiss, while the
people gazed in envy and admiration; and he said to old D’Arc:</p>
<p>“Give God thanks for that you are father to this child, this
dispenser of immortalities. You who bear a name that will still live in
the mouths of men when all the race of kings has been forgotten, it is
not meet that you bare your head before the fleeting fames and dignities
of a day–cover yourself!“ And truly he looked right fine and princely
when he said that. Then he gave order that the Bailly of Rheims be
brought; and when he was come, and stood bent low and bare, the King
said to him, “These two are guests of France;“ and bade him use them
hospitably.</p>
<p>I may as well say now as later, that Papa D’Arc and Laxart were
stopping in that little Zebra inn, and that there they remained. Finer
quarters were offered them by the Bailly, also public distinctions and
brave entertainment; but they were frightened at these projects, they
being only humble and ignorant peasants; so they begged off, and had
peace. They could not have enjoyed such things. Poor souls, they did not
even know what to do with their hands, and it took all their attention
to keep from treading on them. The Bailly did the best he could in the
circumstances. He made the innkeeper place a whole floor at their
disposal, and told him to provide everything they might desire, and
charge all to the city. Also the Bailly gave them a horse apiece and
furnishings; which so overwhelmed them with pride and delight and
astonishment that they couldn’t speak a word; for in their lives they
had never dreamed of wealth like this, and could not believe, at first,
that the horses were real and would not dissolve to a mist and blow
away. They could not unglue their minds from those grandeurs, and were
always wrenching the conversation out of its groove and dragging the
matter of animals into it, so that they could say “my horse“ here, and
“my horse“ there and yonder and all around, and taste the words and lick
their chops over them, and spread their legs and hitch their thumbs in
their armpits, and feel as the good God feels when He looks out on His
fleets of constellations plowing the awful deeps of space and reflects
with satisfaction that they are His–all His. Well, they were the
happiest old children one ever saw, and the simplest.</p>
<p>The city gave a grand banquet to the King and Joan in mid-afternoon,
and to the Court and the Grand Staff; and about the middle of it Pere
D’Arc and Laxart were sent for, but would not venture until it was
promised that they might sit in a gallery and be all by themselves and
see all that was to be seen and yet be unmolested. And so they sat there
and looked down upon the splendid spectacle, and were moved till the
tears ran down their cheeks to see the unbelievable honors that were
paid to their small darling, and how naively serene and unafraid she sat
there with those consuming glories beating upon her.</p>
<p>But at last her serenity was broken up. Yes, it stood the strain of
the King’s gracious speech; and of D’Alencon’s praiseful words, and the
Bastard’s; and even La Hire’s thunder-blast, which took the place by
storm; but at last, as I have said, they brought a force to bear which
was too strong for her. For at the close the King put up his hand to
command silence, and so waited, with his hand up, till every sound was
dead and it was as if one could almost the stillness, so profound it
was. Then out of some remote corner of that vast place there rose a
plaintive voice, and in tones most tender and sweet and rich came
floating through that enchanted hush our poor old simple song “L’Arbre
Fee Bourlemont!“ and then Joan broke down and put her face in her hands
and cried. Yes, you see, all in a moment the pomps and grandeurs
dissolved away and she was a little child again herding her sheep with
the tranquil pastures stretched about her, and war and wounds and blood
and death and the mad frenzy and turmoil of battle a dream. Ah, that
shows you the power of music, that magician of magicians, who lifts his
wand and says his mysterious word and all things real pass away and the
phantoms of your mind walk before you clothed in flesh.</p>
<p>That was the King’s invention, that sweet and dear surprise. Indeed,
he had fine things hidden away in his nature, though one seldom got a
glimpse of them, with that scheming Tremouille and those others always
standing in the light, and he so indolently content to save himself fuss
and argument and let them have their way.</p>
<p>At the fall of night we the Domremy contingent of the personal staff
were with the father and uncle at the inn, in their private parlor,
brewing generous drinks and breaking ground for a homely talk about
Domremy and the neighbors, when a large parcel arrived from Joan to be
kept till she came; and soon she came herself and sent her guard away,
saying she would take one of her father’s rooms and sleep under his
roof, and so be at home again. We of the staff rose and stood, as was
meet, until she made us sit. Then she turned and saw that the two old
men had gotten up too, and were standing in an embarrassed and
unmilitary way; which made her want to laugh, but she kept it in, as not
wishing to hurt them; and got them to their seats and snuggled down
between them, and took a hand of each of them upon her knees and nestled
her own hands in them, and said:</p>
<p>“Now we will nave no more ceremony, but be kin and playmates as in
other times; for I am done with the great wars now, and you two will
take me home with you, and I shall see–“ She stopped, and for a moment
her happy face sobered, as if a doubt or a presentiment had flitted
through her mind; then it cleared again, and she said, with a passionate
yearning, “Oh, if the day were but come and we could start!“</p>
<p>The old father was surprised, and said:</p>
<p>“Why, child, are you in earnest? Would you leave doing these wonders
that make you to be praised by everybody while there is still so much
glory to be won; and would you go out from this grand comradeship with
princes and generals to be a drudging villager again and a nobody? It is
not rational.“</p>
<p>“No,“ said the uncle, Laxart, “it is amazing to hear, and indeed not
understandable. It is a stranger thing to hear her say she will stop the
soldiering that it was to hear her say she would begin it; and I who
speak to you can say in all truth that that was the strangest word that
ever I had heard till this day and hour. I would it could be
explained.“</p>
<p>“It is not difficult,“ said Joan. “I was not ever fond of wounds and
suffering, nor fitted by my nature to inflict them; and quarrelings did
always distress me, and noise and tumult were against my liking, my
disposition being toward peace and quietness, and love for all things
that have life; and being made like this, how could I bear to think of
wars and blood, and the pain that goes with them, and the sorrow and
mourning that follow after? But by his angels God laid His great
commands upon me, and could I disobey? I did as I was bid. Did He
command me to do many things? No; only two: to raise the siege of
Orleans, and crown the King at Rheims. The task is finished, and I am
free. Has ever a poor soldier fallen in my sight, whether friend or foe,
and I not felt the pain in my own body, and the grief of his home-mates
in my own heart? No, not one; and, oh, it is such bliss to know that my
release is won, and that I shall not any more see these cruel things or
suffer these tortures of the mind again! Then why should I not go to my
village and be as I was before? It is heaven! and ye wonder that I
desire it. Ah, ye are men–just men! My mother would understand.“</p>
<p>They didn’t quite know what to say; so they sat still awhile, looking
pretty vacant. Then old D’Arc said:</p>
<p>“Yes, your mother–that is true. I never saw such a woman. She
worries, and worries, and worries; and wakes nights, and lies so,
thinking–that is, worrying; worrying about you. And when the night
storms go raging along, she moans and says, ‘Ah, God pity her, she is
out in this with her poor wet soldiers.’ And when the lightning glares
and the thunder crashes she wrings her hands and trembles, saying, ’It
is like the awful cannon and the flash, and yonder somewhere she is
riding down upon the spouting guns and I not there to protect her.“</p>
<p>“Ah, poor mother, it is pity, it is pity!“</p>
<p>“Yes, a most strange woman, as I have noticed a many times. When
there is news of a victory and all the village goes mad with pride and
joy, she rushes here and there in a maniacal frenzy till she finds out
the one only thing she cares to know–that you are safe; then down she
goes on her knees in the dirt and praises God as long as there is any
breath left in her body; and all on your account, for she never mentions
the battle once. And always she says, ‘Now it is over–now France is
saved–now she will come home’–and always is disappointed and goes about
mourning.“</p>
<p>“Don’t, father! it breaks my heart. I will be so good to her when I
get home. I will do her work for her, and be her comfort, and she shall
not suffer any more through me.“</p>
<p>There was some more talk of this sort, then Uncle Laxart said:</p>
<p>“You have done the will of God, dear, and are quits; it is true, and
none may deny it; but what of the King? You are his best soldier; what
if he command you to stay?“</p>
<p>That was a crusher–and sudden! It took Joan a moment or two to
recover from the shock of it; then she said, quite simply and
resignedly:</p>
<p>“The King is my Lord; I am his servant.“ She was silent and
thoughtful a little while, then she brightened up and said, cheerily,
“But let us drive such thoughts away–this is no time for them. Tell me
about home.“</p>
<p>So the two old gossips talked and talked; talked about everything and
everybody in the village; and it was good to hear. Joan out of her
kindness tried to get us into the conversation, but that failed, of
course. She was the Commander-in-Chief, we were nobodies; her name was
the mightiest in France, we were invisible atoms; she was the comrade of
princes and heroes, we of the humble and obscure; she held rank above
all Personages and all Puissances whatsoever in the whole earth, by
right of baring her commission direct from God. To put it in one word,
she was JOAN OF ARC–and when that is said, all is said. To us she was
divine. Between her and us lay the bridgeless abyss which that word
implies. We could not be familiar with her. No, you can see yourselves
that that would have been impossible.</p>
<p>And yet she was so human, too, and so good and kind and dear and
loving and cheery and charming and unspoiled and unaffected! Those are
all the words I think of now, but they are not enough; no, they are too
few and colorless and meager to tell it all, or tell the half. Those
simple old men didn’t realize her; they couldn’t; they had never known
any people but human beings, and so they had no other standard to
measure her by. To them, after their first little shyness had worn off,
she was just a girl–that was all. It was amazing. It made one shiver,
sometimes, to see how calm and easy and comfortable they were in her
presence, and hear them talk to her exactly as they would have talked to
any other girl in France.</p>
<p>Why, that simple old Laxart sat up there and droned out the most
tedious and empty tale one ever heard, and neither he nor Papa D’Arc
ever gave a thought to the badness of the etiquette of it, or ever
suspected that that foolish tale was anything but dignified and valuable
history. There was not an atom of value in it; and whilst they thought
it distressing and pathetic, it was in fact not pathetic at all, but
actually ridiculous. At least it seemed so to me, and it seems so yet.
Indeed, I know it was, because it made Joan laugh; and the more
sorrowful it got the more it made her laugh; and the Paladin said that
he could have laughed himself if she had not been there, and Noel
Rainguesson said the same. It was about old Laxart going to a funeral
there at Domremy two or three weeks back. He had spots all over his face
and hands, and he got Joan to rub some healing ointment on them, and
while she was doing it, and comforting him, and trying to say pitying
things to him, he told her how it happened. And first he asked her if
she remembered that black bull calf that she left behind when she came
away, and she said indeed she did, and he was a dear, and she loved him
so, and was he well?–and just drowned him in questions about that
creature. And he said it was a young bull now, and very frisky; and he
was to bear a principal hand at a funeral; and she said, “The bull?“ and
he said, “No, myself“; but said the bull did take a hand, but not
because of his being invited, for he wasn’t; but anyway he was away over
beyond the Fairy Tree, and fell asleep on the grass with his Sunday
funeral clothes on, and a long black rag on his hat and hanging down his
back; and when he woke he saw by the sun how late it was, and not a
moment to lose; and jumped up terribly worried, and saw the young bull
grazing there, and thought maybe he could ride part way on him and gain
time; so he tied a rope around the bull’s body to hold on by, and put a
halter on him to steer with, and jumped on and started; but it was all
new to the bull, and he was discontented with it, and scurried around
and bellowed and reared and pranced, and Uncle Laxart was satisfied, and
wanted to get off and go by the next bull or some other way that was
quieter, but he didn’t dare try; and it was getting very warm for him,
too, and disturbing and wearisome, and not proper for Sunday; but by and
by the bull lost all his temper, and went tearing down the slope with
his tail in the air and blowing in the most awful way; and just in the
edge of the village he knocked down some beehives, and the bees turned
out and joined the excursion, and soared along in a black cloud that
nearly hid those other two from sight, and prodded them both, and jabbed
them and speared them and spiked them, and made them bellow and shriek,
and shriek and bellow; and here they came roaring through the village
like a hurricane, and took the funeral procession right in the center,
and sent that section of it sprawling, and galloped over it, and the
rest scattered apart and fled screeching in every direction, every
person with a layer of bees on him, and not a rag of that funeral left
but the corpse; and finally the bull broke for the river and jumped in,
and when they fished Uncle Laxart out he was nearly drowned, and his
face looked like a pudding with raisins in it. And then he turned
around, this old simpleton, and looked a long time in a dazed way at
Joan where she had her face in a cushion, dying, apparently, and
says:</p>
<p>“What do you reckon she is laughing at?“</p>
<p>And old D’Arc stood looking at her the same way, sort of absently
scratching his head; but had to give it up, and said he didn’t
know–“must have been something that happened when we weren’t
noticing.“</p>
<p>Yes, both of those old people thought that that tale was pathetic;
whereas to my mind it was purely ridiculous, and not in any way valuable
to any one. It seemed so to me then, and it seems so to me yet. And as
for history, it does not resemble history; for the office of history is
to furnish serious and important facts that teach; whereas this strange
and useless event teaches nothing; nothing that I can see, except not to
ride a bull to a funeral; and surely no reflecting person needs to be
taught that.</p>
<p>37 Again to Arms</p>
<p>NOW THESE were nobles, you know, by decree of the King!–these
precious old infants. But they did not realize it; they could not be
called conscious of it; it was an abstraction, a phantom; to them it had
no substance; their minds could not take hold of it. No, they did not
bother about their nobility; they lived in their horses. The horses were
solid; they were visible facts, and would make a mighty stir in Domremy.
Presently something was said about the Coronation, and old D’Arc said it
was going to be a grand thing to be able to say, when they got home,
that they were present in the very town itself when it happened. Joan
looked troubled, and said:</p>
<p>“Ah, that reminds me. You were here and you didn’t send me word. In
the town, indeed! Why, you could have sat with the other nobles, and ben
welcome; and could have looked upon the crowning itself, and carried
that home to tell. Ah, why did you use me so, and send me no word?“</p>
<p>The old father was embarrassed, now, quite visibly embarrassed, and
had the air of one who does not quite know what to say. But Joan was
looking up in his face, her hands upon his shoulders–waiting. He had to
speak; so presently he drew her to his breast, which was heaving with
emotion; and he said, getting out his words with difficulty:</p>
<p>“There, hide your face, child, and let your old father humble himself
and make his confession. I–I–don’t you see, don’t you understand?–I
could not know that these grandeurs would not turn your young head–it
would be only natural. I might shame you before these great per–“</p>
<p>“Father!“</p>
<p>“And then I was afraid, as remembering that cruel thing I said once
in my sinful anger. Oh, appointed of God to be a soldier, and the
greatest in the land! and in my ignorant anger I said I would drown you
with my own hands if you unsexed yourself and brought shame to your name
and family. Ah, how could I ever have said it, and you so good and dear
and innocent! I was afraid; for I was guilty. You understand it now, my
child, and you forgive?“</p>
<p>Do you see? Even that poor groping old land-crab, with his skull full
of pulp, had pride. Isn’t it wonderful? And more–he had conscience; he
had a sense of right and wrong, such as it was; he was able to find
remorse. It looks impossible, it looks incredible, but it is not. I
believe that some day it will be found out that peasants are people.
Yes, beings in a great many respects like ourselves. And I believe that
some day they will find this out, too–and then! Well, then I think they
will rise up and demand to be regarded as part of the race, and that by
consequence there will be trouble. Whenever one sees in a book or in a
king’s proclamation those words “the nation,“ they bring before us the
upper classes; only those; we know no other “nation“; for us and the
kings no other “nation“ exists. But from the day that I saw old D’Arc
the peasant acting and feeling just as I should have acted and felt
myself, I have carried the conviction in my heart that our peasants are
not merely animals, beasts of burden put here by the good God to produce
food and comfort for the “nation,“ but something more and better. You
look incredulous. Well, that is your training; it is the training of
everybody; but as for me, I thank that incident for giving me a better
light, and I have never forgotten it.</p>
<p>Let me see–where was I? One’s mind wanders around here and there and
yonder, when one is old. I think I said Joan comforted him. Certainly,
that is what she would do–there was no need to say that. She coaxed him
and petted him and caressed him, and laid the memory of that old hard
speech of his to rest. Laid it to rest until she should be dead. Then he
would remember it again–yes, yes! Lord, how those things sting, and
burn, and gnaw–the things which we did against the innocent dead! And we
say in our anguish, “If they could only come back!“ Which is all very
well to say, but, as far as I can see, it doesn’t profit anything. In my
opinion the best way is not to do the thing in the first place. And I am
not alone in this; I have heard our two knights say the same thing; and
a man there in Orleans–no, I believe it was at Beaugency, or one of
those places–it seems more as if it was at Beaugency than the
others–this man said the same thing exactly; almost the same words; a
dark man with a cast in his eye and one leg shorter than the other. His
name was–was–it is singular that I can’t call that man’s name; I had it
in my mind only a moment ago, and I know it begins with–no, I don’t
remember what it begins with; but never mind, let it go; I will think of
it presently, and then I will tell you.</p>
<p>Well, pretty soon the old father wanted to know how Joan felt when
she was in the thick of a battle, with the bright blades hacking and
flashing all around her, and the blows rapping and slatting on her
shield, and blood gushing on her from the cloven ghastly face and broken
teeth of the neighbor at her elbow, and the perilous sudden back surge
of massed horses upon a person when the front ranks give way before a
heavy rush of the enemy, and men tumble limp and groaning out of saddles
all around, and battle-flags falling from dead hands wipe across one’s
face and hide the tossing turmoil a moment, and in the reeling and
swaying and laboring jumble one’s horse’s hoofs sink into soft
substances and shrieks of pain respond, and presently–panic! rush!
swarm! flight! and death and hell following after! And the old fellow
got ever so much excited; and strode up and down, his tongue going like
a mill, asking question after question and never waiting for an answer;
and finally he stood Joan up in the middle of the room and stepped off
and scanned her critically, and said:</p>
<p>“No–I don’t understand it. You are so little. So little and slender.
When you had your armor on, to-day, it gave one a sort of notion of it;
but in these pretty silks and velvets, you are only a dainty page, not a
league-striding war-colossus, moving in clouds and darkness and
breathing smoke and thunder. I would God I might see you at it and go
tell your mother! That would help her sleep, poor thing! Here–teach me
the arts of the soldier, that I may explain them to her.“</p>
<p>And she did it. She gave him a pike, and put him through the manual
of arms; and made him do the steps, too. His marching was incredibly
awkward and slovenly, and so was his drill with the pike; but he didn’t
know it, and was wonderfully pleased with himself, and mightily excited
and charmed with the ringing, crisp words of command. I am obliged to
say that if looking proud and happy when one is marching were
sufficient, he would have been the perfect soldier.</p>
<p>And he wanted a lesson in sword-play, and got it. But of course that
was beyond him; he was too old. It was beautiful to see Joan handle the
foils, but the old man was a bad failure. He was afraid of the things,
and skipped and dodged and scrambled around like a woman who has lost
her mind on account of the arrival of a bat. He was of no good as an
exhibition. But if La Hire had only come in, that would have been
another matter. Those two fenced often; I saw them many times. True,
Joan was easily his master, but it made a good show for all that, for La
Hire was a grand swordsman. What a swift creature Joan was! You would
see her standing erect with her ankle-bones together and her foil arched
over her head, the hilt in one hand and the button in the other–the old
general opposite, bent forward, left hand reposing on his back, his foil
advanced, slightly wiggling and squirming, his watching eye boring
straight into hers–and all of a sudden she would give a spring forward,
and back again; and there she was, with the foil arched over her head as
before. La Hire had been hit, but all that the spectator saw of it was a
something like a thin flash of light in the air, but nothing distinct,
nothing definite.</p>
<p>We kept the drinkables moving, for that would please the Bailly and
the landlord; and old Laxart and D’Arc got to feeling quite comfortable,
but without being what you could call tipsy. They got out the presents
which they had been buying to carry home–humble things and cheap, but
they would be fine there, and welcome. And they gave to Joan a present
from Pere Fronte and one from her mother–the one a little leaden image
of the Holy Virgin, the other half a yard of blue silk ribbon; and she
was as pleased as a child; and touched, too, as one could see plainly
enough. Yes, she kissed those poor things over and over again, as if
they had been something costly and wonderful; and she pinned the Virgin
on her doublet, and sent for her helmet and tied the ribbon on that;
first one way, then another; then a new way, then another new way; and
with each effort perching the helmet on her hand and holding it off this
way and that, and canting her head to one side and then the other,
examining the effect, as a bird does when it has got a new bug. And she
said she could almost wish she was going to the wars again; for then she
would fight with the better courage, as having always with her something
which her mother’s touch had blessed.</p>
<p>Old Laxart said he hoped she would go to the wars again, but home
first, for that all the people there were cruel anxious to see her–and
so he went on:</p>
<p>“They are proud of you, dear. Yes, prouder than any village ever was
of anybody before. And indeed it is right and rational; for it is the
first time a village has ever had anybody like you to be proud of and
call its own. And it is strange and beautiful how they try to give your
name to every creature that has a sex that is convenient. It is but half
a year since you began to be spoken of and left us, and so it is
surprising to see how many babies there are already in that region that
are named for you. First it was just Joan; then it was Joan-Orleans;
then Joan-Orleans-Beaugency-Patay; and now the next ones will have a lot
of towns and the Coronation added, of course. Yes, and the animals the
same. They know how you love animals, and so they try to do you honor
and show their love for you by naming all those creatures after you;
insomuch that if a body should step out and call “Joan of Arc–come!“
there would be a landslide of cats and all such things, each supposing
it was the one wanted, and all willing to take the benefit of the doubt,
anyway, for the sake of the food that might be on delivery. The kitten
you left behind–the last stray you fetched home–bears you name, now, and
belongs to Pere Fronte, and is the pet and pride of the village; and
people have come miles to look at it and pet it and stare at it and
wonder over it because it was Joan of Arc’s cat. Everybody will tell you
that; and one day when a stranger threw a stone at it, not knowing it
was your cat, the village rose against him as one man and hanged him!
And but for Pere Fronte–“</p>
<p>There was an interruption. It was a messenger from the King, bearing
a note for Joan, which I read to her, saying he had reflected, and had
consulted his other generals, and was obliged to ask her to remain at
the head of the army and withdraw her resignation. Also, would she come
immediately and attend a council of war? Straightway, at a little
distance, military commands and the rumble of drums broke on the still
night, and we knew that her guard was approaching.</p>
<p>Deep disappointment clouded her face for just one moment and no
more–it passed, and with it the homesick girl, and she was Joan of Arc,
Commander-in-Chief again, and ready for duty.</p>
<p>38 The King Cries “Forward!“</p>
<p>IN MY double quality of page and secretary I followed Joan to the
council. She entered that presence with the bearing of a grieved
goddess. What was become of the volatile child that so lately was
enchanted with a ribbon and suffocated with laughter over the distress
of a foolish peasant who had stormed a funeral on the back of a
bee-stung bull? One may not guess. Simply it was gone, and had left no
sign. She moved straight to the council-table, and stood. Her glance
swept from face to face there, and where it fell, these lit it as with a
torch, those it scorched as with a brand. She knew where to strike. She
indicated the generals with a nod, and said:</p>
<p>“My business is not with you. You have not craved a council of war.“
Then she turned toward the King’s privy council, and continued: “No; it
is with you. A council of war! It is amazing. There is but one thing to
do, and only one, and lo, ye call a council of war! Councils of war have
no value but to decide between two or several doubtful courses. But a
council of war when there is only one course? Conceive of a man in a
boat and his family in the water, and he goes out among his friends to
ask what he would better do? A council of war, name of God! To determine
what?“</p>
<p>She stopped, and turned till her eyes rested upon the face of La
Tremouille; and so she stood, silent, measuring him, the excitement in
all faces burning steadily higher and higher, and all pulses beating
faster and faster; then she said, with deliberation:</p>
<p>“Every sane man–whose loyalty is to his King and not a show and a
pretense–knows that there is but one rational thing before us–the march
upon Paris!“</p>
<p>Down came the fist of La Hire with an approving crash upon the table.
La Tremouille turned white with anger, but he pulled himself firmly
together and held his peace. The King’s lazy blood was stirred and his
eye kindled finely, for the spirit of war was away down in him
somewhere, and a frank, bold speech always found it and made it tingle
gladsomely. Joan waited to see if the chief minister might wish to
defend his position; but he was experienced and wise, and not a man to
waste his forces where the current was against him. He would wait; the
King’s private ear would be at his disposal by and by.</p>
<p>That pious fox the Chancellor of France took the word now. He washed
his soft hands together, smiling persuasively, and said to Joan:</p>
<p>“Would it be courteous, your Excellency, to move abruptly from here
without waiting for an answer from the Duke of Burgundy? You may not
know that we are negotiating with his Highness, and that there is likely
to be a fortnight’s truce between us; and on his part a pledge to
deliver Paris into our hands without the cost of a blow or the fatigue
of a march thither.“</p>
<p>Joan turned to him and said, gravely:</p>
<p>“This is not a confessional, my lord. You were not obliged to expose
that shame here.“</p>
<p>The Chancellor’s face reddened, and he retorted:</p>
<p>“Shame? What is there shameful about it?“</p>
<p>Joan answered in level, passionless tones:</p>
<p>“One may describe it without hunting far for words. I knew of this
poor comedy, my lord, although it was not intended that I should know.
It is to the credit of the devisers of it that they tried to conceal
it–this comedy whose text and impulse are describable in two words.“</p>
<p>The Chancellor spoke up with a fine irony in his manner:</p>
<p>“Indeed? And will your Excellency be good enough to utter them?“</p>
<p>“Cowardice and treachery!“</p>
<p>The fists of all the generals came down this time, and again the
King’s eye sparkled with pleasure. The Chancellor sprang to his feet and
appealed to his Majesty:</p>
<p>“Sire, I claim your protection.“</p>
<p>But the King waved him to his seat again, saying:</p>
<p>“Peace. She had a right to be consulted before that thing was
undertaken, since it concerned war as well as politics. It is but just
that she be heard upon it now.“</p>
<p>The Chancellor sat down trembling with indignation, and remarked to
Joan:</p>
<p>“Out of charity I will consider that you did not know who devised
this measure which you condemn in so candid language.“</p>
<p>“Save your charity for another occasion, my lord,“ said Joan, as
calmly as before. “Whenever anything is done to injure the interests and
degrade the honor of France, all but the dead know how to name the two
conspirators-in-chief–“</p>
<p>“Sir, sire! this insinuation–“</p>
<p>“It is not an insinuation, my lord,“ said Joan, placidly, “it is a
charge. I bring it against the King’s chief minister and his
Chancellor.“</p>
<p>Both men were on their feet now, insisting that the King modify
Joan’s frankness; but he was not minded to do it. His ordinary councils
were stale water–his spirit was drinking wine, now, and the taste of it
was good. He said:</p>
<p>“Sit–and be patient. What is fair for one must in fairness be allowed
the other. Consider–and be just. When have you two spared her? What dark
charges and harsh names have you withheld when you spoke of her?“ Then
he added, with a veiled twinkle in his eyes, “If these are offenses I
see no particular difference between them, except that she says her hard
things to your faces, whereas you say yours behind her back.“</p>
<p>He was pleased with that neat shot and the way it shriveled those two
people up, and made La Hire laugh out loud and the other generals softly
quake and chuckle. Joan tranquilly resumed:</p>
<p>“From the first, we have been hindered by this policy of
shilly-shally; this fashion of counseling and counseling and counseling
where no counseling is needed, but only fighting. We took Orleans on the
8th of May, and could have cleared the region round about in three days
and saved the slaughter of Patay. We could have been in Rheims six weeks
ago, and in Paris now; and would see the last Englishman pass out of
France in half a year. But we struck no blow after Orleans, but went off
into the country–what for? Ostensibly to hold councils; really to give
Bedford time to send reinforcements to Talbot–which he did; and Patay
had to be fought. After Patay, more counseling, more waste of precious
time. Oh, my King, I would that you would be persuaded!“ She began to
warm up, now. “Once more we have our opportunity. If we rise and strike,
all is well. Bid me march upon Paris. In twenty days it shall be yours,
and in six months all France! Here is half a year’s work before us; if
this chance be wasted, I give you twenty years to do it in. Speak the
word, O gentle King–speak but the one–“</p>
<p>“I cry you mercy!“ interrupted the Chancellor, who saw a dangerous
enthusiasm rising in the King’s face. “March upon Paris? Does your
Excellency forget that the way bristles with English strongholds?“</p>
<p>“That for your English strongholds!“ and Joan snapped her fingers
scornfully. “Whence have we marched in these last days? From Gien. And
whither? To Rheims. What bristled between? English strongholds. What are
they now? French ones–and they never cost a blow!“ Here applause broke
out from the group of generals, and Joan had to pause a moment to let it
subside. “Yes, English strongholds bristled before us; now French ones
bristle behind us. What is the argument? A child can read it. The
strongholds between us and Paris are garrisoned by no new breed of
English, but by the same breed as those others–with the same fears, the
same questionings, the same weaknesses, the same disposition to see the
heavy hand of God descending upon them. We have but to march!–on the
instant–and they are ours, Paris is ours, France is ours! Give the word,
O my King, command your servant to–“</p>
<p>“Stay!“ cried the Chancellor. “It would be madness to put our affront
upon his Highness the Duke of Burgundy. By the treaty which we have
every hope to make with him–“</p>
<p>“Oh, the treaty which we hope to make with him! He has scorned you
for years, and defied you. Is it your subtle persuasions that have
softened his manners and beguiled him to listen to proposals? No; it was
blows!–the blows which we gave him! That is the only teaching that that
sturdy rebel can understand. What does he care for wind? The treaty
which we hope to make with him–alack! He deliver Paris! There is no
pauper in the land that is less able to do it. He deliver Paris! Ah, but
that would make great Bedford smile! Oh, the pitiful pretext! the blind
can see that this thin pour-parler with its fifteen-day truce has no
purpose but to give Bedford time to hurry forward his forces against us.
More treachery–always treachery! We call a council of war–with nothing
to council about; but Bedford calls no council to teach him what our
course is. He knows what he would do in our place. He would hang his
traitors and march upon Paris! O gentle King, rouse! The way is open,
Paris beckons, France implores, Speak and we–“</p>
<p>“Sire, it is madness, sheer madness! Your Excellency, we cannot, we
must not go back from what we have done; we have proposed to treat, we
must treat with the Duke of Burgundy.“</p>
<p>“And we will!“ said Joan.</p>
<p>“Ah? How?“</p>
<p>“At the point of the lance!“</p>
<p>The house rose, to a man–all that had French hearts–and let go a
crack of applause–and kept it up; and in the midst of it one heard La
Hire growl out: “At the point of the lance! By God, that is music!“ The
King was up, too, and drew his sword, and took it by the blade and
strode to Joan and delivered the hilt of it into her hand, saying:</p>
<p>“There, the King surrenders. Carry it to Paris.“</p>
<p>And so the applause burst out again, and the historical council of
war that has bred so many legends was over.</p>
