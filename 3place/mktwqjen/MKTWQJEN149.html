<h4 id="chapter-v.">CHAPTER V.</h4>
<p>Il veut faire secher de la neige au four et la vendre pour du sel
blanc.</p>
<p>When the Boreas backed away from the land to continue her voyage up
the river, the Hawkinses were richer by twenty-four hours of experience
in the contemplation of human suffering and in learning through honest
hard work how to relieve it. And they were richer in another way also.
In the early turmoil an hour after the explosion, a little black-eyed
girl of five years, frightened and crying bitterly, was struggling
through the throng in the Boreas’ saloon calling her mother and father,
but no one answered. Something in the face of Mr. Hawkins attracted her
and she came and looked up at him; was satisfied, and took refuge with
him. He petted her, listened to her troubles, and said he would find her
friends for her. Then he put her in a state-room with his children and
told them to be kind to her (the adults of his party were all busy with
the wounded) and straightway began his search.</p>
<p>It was fruitless. But all day he and his wife made inquiries, and
hoped against hope. All that they could learn was that the child and her
parents came on board at New Orleans, where they had just arrived in a
vessel from Cuba; that they looked like people from the Atlantic States;
that the family name was Van Brunt and the child’s name Laura. This was
all. The parents had not been seen since the explosion. The child’s
manners were those of a little lady, and her clothes were daintier and
finer than any Mrs. Hawkins had ever seen before.</p>
<p>As the hours dragged on the child lost heart, and cried so piteously
for her mother that it seemed to the Hawkinses that the moanings and the
wailings of the mutilated men and women in the saloon did not so strain
at their heart-strings as the sufferings of this little desolate
creature. They tried hard to comfort her; and in trying, learned to love
her; they could not help it, seeing how she clung, to them and put her
arms about their necks and found-no solace but in their kind eyes and
comforting words: There was a question in both their hearts–a question
that rose up and asserted itself with more and more pertinacity as the
hours wore on–but both hesitated to give it voice–both kept silence
–and–waited. But a time came at last when the matter would bear delay no
longer. The boat had landed, and the dead and the wounded were being
conveyed to the shore. The tired child was asleep in the arms of
Mrs. Hawkins. Mr. Hawkins came into their presence and stood without
speaking. His eyes met his wife’s; then both looked at the child–and as
they looked it stirred in its sleep and nestled closer; an expression of
contentment and peace settled upon its face that touched the
mother-heart; and when the eyes of husband and wife met again, the
question was asked and answered.</p>
<p>When the Boreas had journeyed some four hundred miles from the time
the Hawkinses joined her, a long rank of steamboats was sighted, packed
side by side at a wharf like sardines, in a box, and above and beyond
them rose the domes and steeples and general architectural confusion of
a city–a city with an imposing umbrella of black smoke spread over it.
This was St. Louis. The children of the Hawkins family were playing
about the hurricane deck, and the father and mother were sitting in the
lee of the pilot house essaying to keep order and not greatly grieved
that they were not succeeding.</p>
<p>“They’re worth all the trouble they are, Nancy.“</p>
<p>“Yes, and more, Si.“</p>
<p>“I believe you! You wouldn’t sell one of them at a good round
figure?“</p>
<p>“Not for all the money in the bank, Si.“</p>
<p>“My own sentiments every time. It is true we are not rich–but still
you are not sorry—you haven’t any misgivings about the additions?“</p>
<p>“No. God will provide“</p>
<p>“Amen. And so you wouldn’t even part with Clay? Or Laura!“</p>
<p>“Not for anything in the world. I love them just the same as I love
my own: They pet me and spoil me even more than the others do, I think.
I reckon we’ll get along, Si.“</p>
<p>“Oh yes, it will all come out right, old mother. I wouldn’t be afraid
to adopt a thousand children if I wanted to, for there’s that Tennessee
Land, you know–enough to make an army of them rich. A whole army, Nancy!
You and I will never see the day, but these little chaps will. Indeed
they will. One of these days it will be the rich Miss Emily Hawkins–and
the wealthy Miss Laura Van Brunt Hawkins–and the Hon. George Washington
Hawkins, millionaire–and Gov. Henry Clay Hawkins, millionaire! That is
the way the world will word it! Don’t let’s ever fret about the
children, Nancy–never in the world. They’re all right. Nancy, there’s
oceans and oceans of money in that land–mark my words!“</p>
<p>The children had stopped playing, for the moment, and drawn near to
listen. Hawkins said:</p>
<p>“Washington, my boy, what will you do when you get to be one of the
richest men in the world?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know, father. Sometimes I think I’ll have a balloon and go
up in the air; and sometimes I think I’ll have ever so many books; and
sometimes I think I’ll have ever so many weathercocks and water-wheels;
or have a machine like that one you and Colonel Sellers bought; and
sometimes I think I’ll have–well, somehow I don’t know–somehow I ain’t
certain; maybe I’ll get a steamboat first.“</p>
<p>“The same old chap!–always just a little bit divided about
things.–And what will you do when you get to be one of the richest men
in the world, Clay?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know, sir. My mother–my other mother that’s gone away–she
always told me to work along and not be much expecting to get rich, and
then I wouldn’t be disappointed if I didn’t get rich. And so I reckon
it’s better for me to wait till I get rich, and then by that time maybe
I’ll know what I’ll want–but I don’t now, sir.“</p>
<p>“Careful old head!–Governor Henry Clay Hawkins!–that’s what you’ll
be, Clay, one of these days. Wise old head! weighty old head! Go on,
now, and play–all of you. It’s a prime lot, Nancy; as the Obedstown folk
say about their hogs.“</p>
<p>A smaller steamboat received the Hawkinses and their fortunes, and
bore them a hundred and thirty miles still higher up the Mississippi,
and landed them at a little tumble-down village on the Missouri shore in
the twilight of a mellow October day.</p>
<p>The next morning they harnessed up their team and for two days they
wended slowly into the interior through almost roadless and uninhabited
forest solitudes. And when for the last time they pitched their tents,
metaphorically speaking, it was at the goal of their hopes, their new
home.</p>
<p>By the muddy roadside stood a new log cabin, one story high–the
store; clustered in the neighborhood were ten or twelve more cabins,
some new, some old.</p>
<p>In the sad light of the departing day the place looked homeless
enough. Two or three coatless young men sat in front of the store on a
dry-goods box, and whittled it with their knives, kicked it with their
vast boots, and shot tobacco-juice at various marks. Several ragged
negroes leaned comfortably against the posts of the awning and
contemplated the arrival of the wayfarers with lazy curiosity. All these
people presently managed to drag themselves to the vicinity of the
Hawkins’ wagon, and there they took up permanent positions, hands in
pockets and resting on one leg; and thus anchored they proceeded to look
and enjoy. Vagrant dogs came wagging around and making inquiries of
Hawkins’s dog, which were not satisfactory and they made war on him in
concert. This would have interested the citizens but it was too many on
one to amount to anything as a fight, and so they commanded the peace
and the foreign dog coiled his tail and took sanctuary under the wagon.
Slatternly negro girls and women slouched along with pails deftly
balanced on their heads, and joined the group and stared. Little half
dressed white boys, and little negro boys with nothing whatever on but
tow-linen shirts with a fine southern exposure, came from various
directions and stood with their hands locked together behind them and
aided in the inspection. The rest of the population were laying down
their employments and getting ready to come, when a man burst through
the assemblage and seized the new-comers by the hands in a frenzy of
welcome, and exclaimed–indeed almost shouted:</p>
<p>“Well who could have believed it! Now is it you sure enough–turn
around! hold up your heads! I want to look at you good! Well, well,
well, it does seem most too good to be true, I declare! Lord, I’m so
glad to see you! Does a body’s whole soul good to look at you! Shake
hands again! Keep on shaking hands! Goodness gracious alive. What will
my wife say?–Oh yes indeed, it’s so!–married only last week–lovely,
perfectly lovely creature, the noblest woman that ever–you’ll like her,
Nancy! Like her? Lord bless me you’ll love her–you’ll dote on her
–you’ll be twins! Well, well, well, let me look at you again! Same old
–why bless my life it was only jest this very morning that my wife says,
‘Colonel’–she will call me Colonel spite of everything I can do–she says
‘Colonel, something tells me somebody’s coming!’ and sure enough here
you are, the last people on earth a body could have expected. Why she’ll
think she’s a prophetess–and hanged if I don’t think so too –and you
know there ain’t any, country but what a prophet’s an honor to, as the
proverb says. Lord bless me and here’s the children, too! Washington,
Emily, don’t you know me? Come, give us a kiss. Won’t I fix you,
though!–ponies, cows, dogs, everything you can think of that’ll delight
a child’s heart-and–Why how’s this? Little strangers? Well you won’t be
any strangers here, I can tell you. Bless your souls we’ll make you
think you never was at home before–’deed and ’deed we will, I can tell
you! Come, now, bundle right along with me. You can’t glorify any hearth
stone but mine in this camp, you know–can’t eat anybody’s bread but
mine–can’t do anything but just make yourselves perfectly at home and
comfortable, and spread yourselves out and rest! You hear me! Here–Jim,
Tom, Pete, Jake, fly around! Take that team to my place–put the wagon in
my lot–put the horses under the shed, and get out hay and oats and fill
them up! Ain’t any hay and oats? Well get some–have it charged to
me–come, spin around, now! Now, Hawkins, the procession’s ready; mark
time, by the left flank, forward-march!“</p>
<p>And the Colonel took the lead, with Laura astride his neck, and the
newly-inspired and very grateful immigrants picked up their tired limbs
with quite a spring in them and dropped into his wake.</p>
<p>Presently they were ranged about an old-time fire-place whose blazing
logs sent out rather an unnecessary amount of heat, but that was no
matter-supper was needed, and to have it, it had to be cooked. This
apartment was the family bedroom, parlor, library and kitchen, all in
one. The matronly little wife of the Colonel moved hither and thither
and in and out with her pots and pans in her hands’, happiness in her
heart and a world of admiration of her husband in her eyes. And when at
last she had spread the cloth and loaded it with hot corn bread, fried
chickens, bacon, buttermilk, coffee, and all manner of country luxuries,
Col. Sellers modified his harangue and for a moment throttled it down to
the orthodox pitch for a blessing, and then instantly burst forth again
as from a parenthesis and clattered on with might and main till every
stomach in the party was laden with all it could carry. And when the
new-comers ascended the ladder to their comfortable feather beds on the
second floor–to wit the garret–Mrs. Hawkins was obliged to say:</p>
<p>“Hang the fellow, I do believe he has gone wilder than ever, but
still a body can’t help liking him if they would–and what is more, they
don’t ever want to try when they see his eyes and hear him talk.“</p>
<p>Within a week or two the Hawkinses were comfortably domiciled in a
new log house, and were beginning to feel at home. The children were put
to school; at least it was what passed for a school in those days: a
place where tender young humanity devoted itself for eight or ten hours
a day to learning incomprehensible rubbish by heart out of books and
reciting it by rote, like parrots; so that a finished education
consisted simply of a permanent headache and the ability to read without
stopping to spell the words or take breath. Hawkins bought out the
village store for a song and proceeded to reap the profits, which
amounted to but little more than another song.</p>
<p>The wonderful speculation hinted at by Col. Sellers in his letter
turned out to be the raising of mules for the Southern market; and
really it promised very well. The young stock cost but a trifle, the
rearing but another trifle, and so Hawkins was easily persuaded to
embark his slender means in the enterprise and turn over the keep and
care of the animals to Sellers and Uncle Dan’l.</p>
<p>All went well: Business prospered little by little. Hawkins even
built a new house, made it two full stories high and put a lightning rod
on it. People came two or three miles to look at it. But they knew that
the rod attracted the lightning, and so they gave the place a wide berth
in a storm, for they were familiar with marksmanship and doubted if the
lightning could hit that small stick at a distance of a mile and a half
oftener than once in a hundred and fifty times. Hawkins fitted out his
house with “store“ furniture from St. Louis, and the fame of its
magnificence went abroad in the land. Even the parlor carpet was from
St. Louis–though the other rooms were clothed in the “rag“ carpeting of
the country. Hawkins put up the first “paling“ fence that had ever
adorned the village; and he did not stop there, but whitewashed it. His
oil-cloth window-curtains had noble pictures on them of castles such as
had never been seen anywhere in the world but on window-curtains.
Hawkins enjoyed the admiration these prodigies compelled, but he always
smiled to think how poor and, cheap they were, compared to what the
Hawkins mansion would display in a future day after the Tennessee Land
should have borne its minted fruit. Even Washington observed, once, that
when the Tennessee Land was sold he would have a “store“ carpet in his
and Clay’s room like the one in the parlor. This pleased Hawkins, but it
troubled his wife. It did not seem wise, to her, to put one’s entire
earthly trust in the Tennessee Land and never think of doing any
work.</p>
<p>Hawkins took a weekly Philadelphia newspaper and a semi-weekly
St. Louis journal–almost the only papers that came to the village,
though Godey’s Lady’s Book found a good market there and was regarded as
the perfection of polite literature by some of the ablest critics in the
place. Perhaps it is only fair to explain that we are writing of a by
gone age–some twenty or thirty years ago. In the two newspapers referred
to lay the secret of Hawkins’s growing prosperity. They kept him
informed of the condition of the crops south and east, and thus he knew
which articles were likely to be in demand and which articles were
likely to be unsalable, weeks and even months in advance of the simple
folk about him. As the months went by he came to be regarded as a
wonderfully lucky man. It did not occur to the citizens that brains were
at the bottom of his luck.</p>
<p>His title of “Squire“ came into vogue again, but only for a season;
for, as his wealth and popularity augmented, that title, by
imperceptible stages, grew up into “Judge;“ indeed’ it bade fair to
swell into “General“ bye and bye. All strangers of consequence who
visited the village gravitated to the Hawkins Mansion and became guests
of the “Judge.“</p>
<p>Hawkins had learned to like the people of his section very much. They
were uncouth and not cultivated, and not particularly industrious; but
they were honest and straightforward, and their virtuous ways commanded
respect. Their patriotism was strong, their pride in the flag was of the
old fashioned pattern, their love of country amounted to idolatry.
Whoever dragged the national honor in the dirt won their deathless
hatred. They still cursed Benedict Arnold as if he were a personal
friend who had broken faith–but a week gone by.</p>
