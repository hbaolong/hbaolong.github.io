<h4 id="chapter-xlix.">CHAPTER XLIX.</h4>
<p>“We’ve struck it!“</p>
<p>This was the announcement at the tent door that woke Philip out of a
sound sleep at dead of night, and shook all the sleepiness out of him in
a trice.</p>
<p>“What! Where is it? When? Coal? Let me see it. What quality is it?“
were some of the rapid questions that Philip poured out as he hurriedly
dressed. “Harry, wake up, my boy, the coal train is coming. Struck it,
eh? Let’s see?“</p>
<p>The foreman put down his lantern, and handed Philip a black lump.
There was no mistake about it, it was the hard, shining anthracite, and
its freshly fractured surface, glistened in the light like polished
steel. Diamond never shone with such lustre in the eyes of Philip.</p>
<p>Harry was exuberant, but Philip’s natural caution found expression in
his next remark.</p>
<p>“Now, Roberts, you are sure about this?“</p>
<p>“What–sure that it’s coal?“</p>
<p>“O, no, sure that it’s the main vein.“</p>
<p>“Well, yes. We took it to be that“</p>
<p>“Did you from the first?“</p>
<p>“I can’t say we did at first. No, we didn’t. Most of the indications
were there, but not all of them, not all of them. So we thought we’d
prospect a bit.“</p>
<p>“Well?“</p>
<p>“It was tolerable thick, and looked as if it might be the vein–looked
as if it ought to be the vein. Then we went down on it a little. Looked
better all the time.“</p>
<p>“When did you strike it?“</p>
<p>“About ten o’clock.“</p>
<p>“Then you’ve been prospecting about four hours.“</p>
<p>“Yes, been sinking on it something over four hours.“</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you couldn’t go down very far in four hours–could
you?“</p>
<p>“O yes–it’s a good deal broke up, nothing but picking and gadding
stuff.“</p>
<p>“Well, it does look encouraging, sure enough–but then the lacking
indications–“</p>
<p>“I’d rather we had them, Mr. Sterling, but I’ve seen more than one
good permanent mine struck without ’em in my time.“</p>
<p>“Well, that is encouraging too.“</p>
<p>“Yes, there was the Union, the Alabama and the Black Mohawk–all good,
sound mines, you know–all just exactly like this one when we first
struck them.“</p>
<p>“Well, I begin to feel a good deal more easy. I guess we’ve really
got it. I remember hearing them tell about the Black Mohawk.“</p>
<p>“I’m free to say that I believe it, and the men all think so too.
They are all old hands at this business.“</p>
<p>“Come Harry, let’s go up and look at it, just for the comfort of it,“
said Philip. They came back in the course of an hour, satisfied and
happy.</p>
<p>There was no more sleep for them that night. They lit their pipes,
put a specimen of the coal on the table, and made it a kind of loadstone
of thought and conversation.</p>
<p>“Of course,“ said Harry, “there will have to be a branch track built,
and a ‘switch-back’ up the hill.“</p>
<p>“Yes, there will be no trouble about getting the money for that now.
We could sell-out tomorrow for a handsome sum. That sort of coal doesn’t
go begging within a mile of a rail-road. I wonder if Mr. Bolton’ would
rather sell out or work it?“</p>
<p>“Oh, work it,“ says Harry, “probably the whole mountain is coal now
you’ve got to it.“</p>
<p>“Possibly it might not be much of a vein after all,“ suggested
Philip.</p>
<p>“Possibly it is; I’ll bet it’s forty feet thick. I told you. I knew
the sort of thing as soon as I put my eyes on it.“</p>
<p>Philip’s next thought was to write to his friends and announce their
good fortune. To Mr. Bolton he wrote a short, business letter, as calm
as he could make it. They had found coal of excellent quality, but they
could not yet tell with absolute certainty what the vein was. The
prospecting was still going on. Philip also wrote to Ruth; but though
this letter may have glowed, it was not with the heat of burning
anthracite. He needed no artificial heat to warm his pen and kindle his
ardor when he sat down to write to Ruth. But it must be confessed that
the words never flowed so easily before, and he ran on for an hour
disporting in all the extravagance of his imagination. When Ruth read
it, she doubted if the fellow had not gone out of his senses. And it was
not until she reached the postscript that she discovered the cause of
the exhilaration. “P. S.–We have found coal.“</p>
<p>The news couldn’t have come to Mr. Bolton in better time. He had
never been so sorely pressed. A dozen schemes which he had in hand, any
one of which might turn up a fortune, all languished, and each needed
just a little more, money to save that which had been invested. He
hadn’t a piece of real estate that was not covered with mortgages, even
to the wild tract which Philip was experimenting on, and which had, no
marketable value above the incumbrance on it.</p>
<p>He had come home that day early, unusually dejected.</p>
<p>“I am afraid,“ he said to his wife, “that we shall have to give up
our house. I don’t care for myself, but for thee and the children.“</p>
<p>“That will be the least of misfortunes,“ said Mrs. Bolton,
cheerfully, “if thee can clear thyself from debt and anxiety, which is
wearing thee out, we can live any where. Thee knows we were never
happier than when we were in a much humbler home.“</p>
<p>“The truth is, Margaret, that affair of Bigler and Small’s has come
on me just when I couldn’t stand another ounce. They have made another
failure of it. I might have known they would; and the sharpers, or
fools, I don’t know which, have contrived to involve me for three times
as much as the first obligation. The security is in my hands, but it is
good for nothing to me. I have not the money to do anything with the
contract.“</p>
<p>Ruth heard this dismal news without great surprise. She had long felt
that they were living on a volcano, that might go in to active operation
at any hour. Inheriting from her father an active brain and the courage
to undertake new things, she had little of his sanguine temperament
which blinds one to difficulties and possible failures. She had little
confidence in the many schemes which had been about to lift her father
out of all his embarrassments and into great wealth, ever since she was
a child; as she grew older, she rather wondered that they were as
prosperous as they seemed to be, and that they did not all go to smash
amid so many brilliant projects. She was nothing but a woman, and did
not know how much of the business prosperity of the world is only a,
bubble of credit and speculation, one scheme helping to float another
which is no better than it, and the whole liable to come to naught and
confusion as soon as the busy brain that conceived them ceases its power
to devise, or when some accident produces a sudden panic.</p>
<p>“Perhaps, I shall be the stay of the family, yet,“ said Ruth, with an
approach to gaiety; “When we move into a little house in town, will thee
let me put a little sign on the door: DR. RUTH BOLTON?“</p>
<p>“Mrs. Dr. Longstreet, thee knows, has a great income.“</p>
<p>“Who will pay for the sign, Ruth?“ asked Mr. Bolton.</p>
<p>A servant entered with the afternoon mail from the office. Mr. Bolton
took his letters listlessly, dreading to open them. He knew well what
they contained, new difficulties, more urgent demands fox money.</p>
<p>“Oh, here is one from Philip. Poor fellow. I shall feel his
disappointment as much as my own bad luck. It is hard to bear when one
is young.“</p>
<p>He opened the letter and read. As he read his face lightened, and he
fetched such a sigh of relief, that Mrs. Bolton and Ruth both
exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Read that,“ he cried, “Philip has found coal!“</p>
<p>The world was changed in a moment. One little sentence had done it.
There was no more trouble. Philip had found coal. That meant relief.
That meant fortune. A great weight was taken off, and the spirits of the
whole household rose magically. Good Money! beautiful demon of Money,
what an enchanter thou art! Ruth felt that she was of less consequence
in the household, now that Philip had found Coal, and perhaps she was
not sorry to feel so.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton was ten years younger the next morning. He went into the
city, and showed his letter on change. It was the sort of news his
friends were quite willing to listen to. They took a new interest in
him. If it was confirmed, Bolton would come right up again. There would
be no difficulty about his getting all the money he wanted. The money
market did not seem to be half so tight as it was the day before.
Mr. Bolton spent a very pleasant day in his office, and went home
revolving some new plans, and the execution of some projects he had long
been prevented from entering upon by the lack of money.</p>
<p>The day had been spent by Philip in no less excitement. By daylight,
with Philip’s letters to the mail, word had gone down to Ilium that coal
had been found, and very early a crowd of eager spectators had come up
to see for themselves.</p>
<p>The “prospecting“ continued day and night for upwards of a week, and
during the first four or five days the indications grew more and more
promising, and the telegrams and letters kept Mr. Bolton duly posted.
But at last a change came, and the promises began to fail with alarming
rapidity. In the end it was demonstrated without the possibility of a
doubt that the great “find“ was nothing but a worthless seam.</p>
<p>Philip was cast down, all the more so because he had been so foolish
as to send the news to Philadelphia before he knew what he was writing
about. And now he must contradict it. “It turns out to be only a mere
seam,“ he wrote, “but we look upon it as an indication of better further
in.“</p>
<p>Alas! Mr. Bolton’s affairs could not wait for “indications.“ The
future might have a great deal in store, but the present was black and
hopeless. It was doubtful if any sacrifice could save him from ruin. Yet
sacrifice he must make, and that instantly, in the hope of saving
something from the wreck of his fortune.</p>
<p>His lovely country home must go. That would bring the most ready
money. The house that he had built with loving thought for each one of
his family, as he planned its luxurious apartments and adorned it; the
grounds that he had laid out, with so much delight in following the
tastes of his wife, with whom the country, the cultivation of rare trees
and flowers, the care of garden and lawn and conservatories were a
passion almost; this home, which he had hoped his children would enjoy
long after he had done with it, must go.</p>
<p>The family bore the sacrifice better than he did. They declared in
fact –women are such hypocrites–that they quite enjoyed the city (it was
in August) after living so long in the country, that it was a thousand
tunes more convenient in every respect; Mrs. Bolton said it was a relief
from the worry of a large establishment, and Ruth reminded her father
that she should have had to come to town anyway before long.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton was relieved, exactly as a water-logged ship is lightened
by throwing overboard the most valuable portion of the cargo–but the
leak was not stopped. Indeed his credit was injured instead of helped by
the prudent step be had taken. It was regarded as a sure evidence of his
embarrassment, and it was much more difficult for him to obtain help
than if he had, instead of retrenching, launched into some new
speculation.</p>
<p>Philip was greatly troubled, and exaggerated his own share in the
bringing about of the calamity.</p>
<p>“You must not look at it so!“ Mr. Bolton wrote him. “You have neither
helped nor hindered–but you know you may help by and by. It would have
all happened just so, if we had never begun to dig that hole. That is
only a drop. Work away. I still have hope that something will occur to
relieve me. At any rate we must not give up the mine, so long as we have
any show.“</p>
<p>Alas! the relief did not come. New misfortunes came instead. When the
extent of the Bigler swindle was disclosed there was no more hope that
Mr. Bolton could extricate himself, and he had, as an honest man, no
resource except to surrender all his property for the benefit of his
creditors.</p>
<p>The Autumn came and found Philip working with diminished force but
still with hope. He had again and again been encouraged by good
“indications,“ but he had again and again been disappointed. He could
not go on much longer, and almost everybody except himself had thought
it was useless to go on as long as he had been doing.</p>
<p>When the news came of Mr. Bolton’s failure, of course the work
stopped. The men were discharged, the tools were housed, the hopeful
noise of pickman and driver ceased, and the mining camp had that
desolate and mournful aspect which always hovers over a frustrated
enterprise.</p>
<p>Philip sat down amid the ruins, and almost wished he were buried in
them. How distant Ruth was now from him, now, when she might need him
most. How changed was all the Philadelphia world, which had hitherto
stood for the exemplification of happiness and prosperity.</p>
<p>He still had faith that there was coal in that mountain. He made a
picture of himself living there a hermit in a shanty by the tunnel,
digging away with solitary pick and wheelbarrow, day after day and year
after year, until he grew gray and aged, and was known in all that
region as the old man of the mountain. Perhaps some day–he felt it must
be so some day–he should strike coal. But what if he did? Who would be
alive to care for it then? What would he care for it then? No, a man
wants riches in his youth, when the world is fresh to him. He wondered
why Providence could not have reversed the usual process, and let the
majority of men begin with wealth and gradually spend it, and die poor
when they no longer needed it.</p>
<p>Harry went back to the city. It was evident that his services were no
longer needed. Indeed, he had letters from his uncle, which he did not
read to Philip, desiring him to go to San Francisco to look after some
government contracts in the harbor there.</p>
<p>Philip had to look about him for something to do; he was like Adam;
the world was all before him whereto choose. He made, before he went
elsewhere, a somewhat painful visit to Philadelphia, painful but yet not
without its sweetnesses. The family had never shown him so much
affection before; they all seemed to think his disappointment of more
importance than their own misfortune. And there was that in Ruth’s
manner–in what she gave him and what she withheld–that would have made a
hero of a very much less promising character than Philip Sterling.</p>
<p>Among the assets of the Bolton property, the Ilium tract was sold,
and Philip bought it in at the vendue, for a song, for no one cared to
even undertake the mortgage on it except himself. He went away the owner
of it, and had ample time before he reached home in November, to
calculate how much poorer he was by possessing it.</p>
