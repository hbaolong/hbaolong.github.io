<h4 id="chapter-xxxv.">CHAPTER XXXV.</h4>
<p>AN ENCOUNTER IN THE DARK</p>
<p>London–to a slave–was a sufficiently interesting place. It was merely
a great big village; and mainly mud and thatch. The streets were muddy,
crooked, unpaved. The populace was an ever flocking and drifting swarm
of rags, and splendors, of nodding plumes and shining armor. The king
had a palace there; he saw the outside of it. It made him sigh; yes, and
swear a little, in a poor juvenile sixth century way. We saw knights and
grandees whom we knew, but they didn’t know us in our rags and dirt and
raw welts and bruises, and wouldn’t have recognized us if we had hailed
them, nor stopped to answer, either, it being unlawful to speak with
slaves on a chain. Sandy passed within ten yards of me on a mule–hunting
for me, I imagined. But the thing which clean broke my heart was
something which happened in front of our old barrack in a square, while
we were enduring the spectacle of a man being boiled to death in oil for
counterfeiting pennies. It was the sight of a newsboy–and I couldn’t get
at him! Still, I had one comfort–here was proof that Clarence was still
alive and banging away. I meant to be with him before long; the thought
was full of cheer.</p>
<p>I had one little glimpse of another thing, one day, which gave me a
great uplift. It was a wire stretching from housetop to housetop.
Telegraph or telephone, sure. I did very much wish I had a little piece
of it. It was just what I needed, in order to carry out my project of
escape. My idea was to get loose some night, along with the king, then
gag and bind our master, change clothes with him, batter him into the
aspect of a stranger, hitch him to the slave-chain, assume possession of
the property, march to Camelot, and–</p>
<p>But you get my idea; you see what a stunning dramatic surprise I
would wind up with at the palace. It was all feasible, if I could only
get hold of a slender piece of iron which I could shape into a
lock-pick. I could then undo the lumbering padlocks with which our
chains were fastened, whenever I might choose. But I never had any luck;
no such thing ever happened to fall in my way. However, my chance came
at last. A gentleman who had come twice before to dicker for me, without
result, or indeed any approach to a result, came again. I was far from
expecting ever to belong to him, for the price asked for me from the
time I was first enslaved was exorbitant, and always provoked either
anger or derision, yet my master stuck stubbornly to it–twenty-two
dollars. He wouldn’t bate a cent. The king was greatly admired, because
of his grand physique, but his kingly style was against him, and he
wasn’t salable; nobody wanted that kind of a slave. I considered myself
safe from parting from him because of my extravagant price. No, I was
not expecting to ever belong to this gentleman whom I have spoken of,
but he had something which I expected would belong to me eventually, if
he would but visit us often enough. It was a steel thing with a long pin
to it, with which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together
in front. There were three of them. He had disappointed me twice,
because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project
entirely safe; but this time I succeeded; I captured the lower clasp of
the three, and when he missed it he thought he had lost it on the
way.</p>
<p>I had a chance to be glad about a minute, then straightway a chance
to be sad again. For when the purchase was about to fail, as usual, the
master suddenly spoke up and said what would be worded thus –in modern
English:</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’m tired supporting these two for no
good. Give me twenty-two dollars for this one, and I’ll throw the other
one in.“</p>
<p>The king couldn’t get his breath, he was in such a fury. He began to
choke and gag, and meantime the master and the gentleman moved away
discussing.</p>
<p>“An ye will keep the offer open–“</p>
<p>“’Tis open till the morrow at this hour.“</p>
<p>“Then I will answer you at that time,“ said the gentleman, and
disappeared, the master following him.</p>
<p>I had a time of it to cool the king down, but I managed it. I
whispered in his ear, to this effect:</p>
<p>“Your grace <em>will</em> go for nothing, but after another fashion.
And so shall I. To-night we shall both be free.“</p>
<p>“Ah! How is that?“</p>
<p>“With this thing which I have stolen, I will unlock these locks and
cast off these chains to-night. When he comes about nine-thirty to
inspect us for the night, we will seize him, gag him, batter him, and
early in the morning we will march out of this town, proprietors of this
caravan of slaves.“</p>
<p>That was as far as I went, but the king was charmed and satisfied.
That evening we waited patiently for our fellow-slaves to get to sleep
and signify it by the usual sign, for you must not take many chances on
those poor fellows if you can avoid it. It is best to keep your own
secrets. No doubt they fidgeted only about as usual, but it didn’t seem
so to me. It seemed to me that they were going to be forever getting
down to their regular snoring. As the time dragged on I got nervously
afraid we shouldn’t have enough of it left for our needs; so I made
several premature attempts, and merely delayed things by it; for I
couldn’t seem to touch a padlock, there in the dark, without starting a
rattle out of it which interrupted somebody’s sleep and made him turn
over and wake some more of the gang.</p>
<p>But finally I did get my last iron off, and was a free man once more.
I took a good breath of relief, and reached for the king’s irons. Too
late! in comes the master, with a light in one hand and his heavy
walking-staff in the other. I snuggled close among the wallow of
snorers, to conceal as nearly as possible that I was naked of irons; and
I kept a sharp lookout and prepared to spring for my man the moment he
should bend over me.</p>
<p>But he didn’t approach. He stopped, gazed absently toward our dusky
mass a minute, evidently thinking about something else; then set down
his light, moved musingly toward the door, and before a body could
imagine what he was going to do, he was out of the door and had closed
it behind him.</p>
<p>“Quick!“ said the king. “Fetch him back!“</p>
<p>Of course, it was the thing to do, and I was up and out in a moment.
But, dear me, there were no lamps in those days, and it was a dark
night. But I glimpsed a dim figure a few steps away. I darted for it,
threw myself upon it, and then there was a state of things and lively!
We fought and scuffled and struggled, and drew a crowd in no time. They
took an immense interest in the fight and encouraged us all they could,
and, in fact, couldn’t have been pleasanter or more cordial if it had
been their own fight. Then a tremendous row broke out behind us, and as
much as half of our audience left us, with a rush, to invest some
sympathy in that. Lanterns began to swing in all directions; it was the
watch gathering from far and near. Presently a halberd fell across my
back, as a reminder, and I knew what it meant. I was in custody. So was
my adversary. We were marched off toward prison, one on each side of the
watchman. Here was disaster, here was a fine scheme gone to sudden
destruction! I tried to imagine what would happen when the master should
discover that it was I who had been fighting him; and what would happen
if they jailed us together in the general apartment for brawlers and
petty law-breakers, as was the custom; and what might–</p>
<p>Just then my antagonist turned his face around in my direction, the
freckled light from the watchman’s tin lantern fell on it, and, by
George, he was the wrong man!</p>
