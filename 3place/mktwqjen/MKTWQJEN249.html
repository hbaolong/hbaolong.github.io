<h4 id="a-royal-compliment">A ROYAL COMPLIMENT</h4>
<p>The latest report about the Spanish crown is, that it will now be
offered to Prince Alfonso, the second son of the King of Portugal, who
is but five years of age. The Spaniards have hunted through all the
nations of Europe for a King. They tried to get a Portuguese in the
person of Dom-Luis, who is an old ex-monarch; they tried to get an
Italian, in the person of Victor Emanuel’s young son, the Duke of Genoa;
they tried to get a Spaniard, in the person of Espartero, who is an
octogenarian. Some of them desired a French Bourbon, Montpensier; some
of them a Spanish Bourbon, the Prince of Asturias; some of them an
English prince, one of the sons of Queen Victoria. They have just tried
to get the German Prince Leopold; but they have thought it better to
give him up than take a war along with him. It is a long time since we
first suggested to them to try an American ruler. We can offer them a
large number of able and experienced sovereigns to pick from–men skilled
in statesmanship, versed in the science of government, and adepts in all
the arts of administration–men who could wear the crown with dignity and
rule the kingdom at a reasonable expense.</p>
<p>There is not the least danger of Napoleon threatening them if they
take an American sovereign; in fact, we have no doubt he would be
pleased to support such a candidature. We are unwilling to mention
names–though we have a man in our eye whom we wish they had in
theirs.–New York Tribune.</p>
<p>It would be but an ostentation of modesty to permit such a pointed
reference to myself to pass unnoticed. This is the second time that ‘The
Tribune’ (no doubt sincerely looking to the best interests of Spain and
the world at large) has done me the great and unusual honour to propose
me as a fit person to fill the Spanish throne. Why ‘The Tribune’ should
single me out in this way from the midst of a dozen Americans of higher
political prominence, is a problem which I cannot solve. Beyond a
somewhat intimate knowledge of Spanish history and a profound veneration
for its great names and illustrious deeds, I feel that I possess no
merit that should peculiarly recommend me to this royal distinction. I
cannot deny that Spanish history has always been mother’s milk to me. I
am proud of every Spanish achievement, from Hernando Cortes’s victory at
Thermopylae down to Vasco Nunez de Balboa’s discovery of the Atlantic
ocean; and of every splendid Spanish name, from Don Quixote and the Duke
of Wellington down to Don Caesar de Bazan. However, these little graces
of erudition are of small consequence, being more showy than
serviceable.</p>
<p>In case the Spanish sceptre is pressed upon me–and the indications
unquestionably are that it will be–I shall feel it necessary to have
certain things set down and distinctly understood beforehand. For
instance: My salary must be paid quarterly in advance. In these
unsettled times it will not do to trust. If Isabella had adopted this
plan, she would be roosting on her ancestral throne to-day, for the
simple reason that her subjects never could have raised three months of
a royal salary in advance, and of course they could not have discharged
her until they had squared up with her. My salary must be paid in gold;
when greenbacks are fresh in a country, they are too fluctuating. My
salary has got to be put at the ruling market rate; I am not going to
cut under on the trade, and they are not going to trail me a long way
from home and then practise on my ignorance and play me for a royal
North Adams Chinaman, by any means. As I understand it, imported kings
generally get five millions a year and house-rent free. Young George of
Greece gets that. As the revenues only yield two millions, he has to
take the national note for considerable; but even with things in that
sort of shape he is better fixed than he was in Denmark, where he had to
eternally stand up because he had no throne to sit on, and had to give
bail for his board, because a royal apprentice gets no salary there
while he is learning his trade. England is the place for that. Fifty
thousand dollars a year Great Britain pays on each royal child that is
born, and this is increased from year to year as the child becomes more
and more indispensable to his country. Look at Prince Arthur. At first
he only got the usual birth-bounty; but now that he has got so that he
can dance, there is simply no telling what wages he gets.</p>
<p>I should have to stipulate that the Spanish people wash more and
endeavour to get along with less quarantine. Do you know, Spain keeps
her ports fast locked against foreign traffic three-fourths of each
year, because one day she is scared about the cholera, and the next
about the plague, and next the measles, next the hooping cough, the
hives, and the rash? but she does not mind leonine leprosy and
elephantiasis any more than a great and enlightened civilisation minds
freckles. Soap would soon remove her anxious distress about foreign
distempers. The reason arable land is so scarce in Spain is because the
people squander so much of it on their persons, and then when they die
it is improvidently buried with them.</p>
<p>I should feel obliged to stipulate that Marshal Serrano be reduced to
the rank of constable, or even roundsman. He is no longer fit to be City
Marshal. A man who refused to be king because he was too old and feeble,
is ill qualified to help sick people to the station-house when they are
armed and their form of delirium tremens is of the exuberant and
demonstrative kind.</p>
<p>I should also require that a force be sent to chase the late Queen
Isabella out of France. Her presence there can work no advantage to
Spain, and she ought to be made to move at once; though, poor thing, she
has been chaste enough heretofore–for a Spanish woman.</p>
<p>I should also require that–</p>
<p>I am at this moment authoritatively informed that “The Tribune“ did
not mean me, after all. Very well, I do not care two cents.</p>
