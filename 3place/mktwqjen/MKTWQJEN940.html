OF 1902. RIVERDALE. YORK HARBOR. ILLNESS OF MRS. CLEMENS</h4>
<p>The year 1902 was an eventful one for Mark Twain. In April he
received a degree of LL.D. from the University of Missouri and returned
to his native State to accept it. This was his last journey to the
Mississippi River. During the summer Mrs. Clemens’s health broke down
and illnesses of one sort or another visited other members of the
family. Amid so much stress and anxiety Clemens had little time or
inclination for work. He wrote not many letters and mainly somber ones.
Once, by way of diversion, he worked out the idea of a curious
club–which he formed–its members to be young girls–girls for the most
part whom he had never seen. They were elected without their consent
from among those who wrote to him without his consent, and it is not
likely that any one so chosen declined membership. One selection from
his letters to the French member, Miss Helene Picard, of St.-Die,
France, will explain the club and present a side of Mask Twain somewhat
different from that found in most of his correspondence.</p>
<p>To Miss Picard, in St.-Die, France:</p>
<p>RIVERDALE-ON-THE-HUDSON, February 22, 1902. DEAR MISS HELENE,–If you
will let me call you so, considering that my head is white and that I
have grownup daughters. Your beautiful letter has given me such deep
pleasure! I will make bold to claim you for a friend and lock you up
with the rest of my riches; for I am a miser who counts his spoil every
day and hoards it secretly and adds to it when he can, and is grateful
to see it grow.</p>
<p>Some of that gold comes, like yourself, in a sealed package, and I
can’t see it and may never have the happiness; but I know its value
without that, and by what sum it increases my wealth.</p>
<p>I have a Club, a private Club, which is all my own. I appoint the
Members myself, and they can’t help themselves, because I don’t allow
them to vote on their own appointment and I don’t allow them to resign!
They are all friends whom I have never seen (save one), but who have
written friendly letters to me.</p>
<p>By the laws of my Club there can be only one Member in each country,
and there can be no male Member but myself. Some day I may admit males,
but I don’t know–they are capricious and inharmonious, and their ways
provoke me a good deal. It is a matter which the Club shall decide.</p>
<p>I have made four appointments in the past three or four months: You
as Member for France, a young Highland girl as Member for Scotland, a
Mohammedan girl as Member for Bengal, and a dear and bright young niece
of mine as Member for the United States–for I do not represent a country
myself, but am merely Member at Large for the Human Race.</p>
<p>You must not try to resign, for the laws of the Club do not allow
that. You must console yourself by remembering that you are in the best
of company; that nobody knows of your membership except myself–that no
Member knows another’s name, but only her country; that no taxes are
levied and no meetings held (but how dearly I should like to attend
one!).</p>
<p>One of my Members is a Princess of a royal house, another is the
daughter of a village book-seller on the continent of Europe. For the
only qualification for Membership is intellect and the spirit of good
will; other distinctions, hereditary or acquired, do not count.</p>
<p>May I send you the Constitution and Laws of the Club? I shall be so
pleased if I may. It is a document which one of my daughters typewrites
for me when I need one for a new Member, and she would give her eyebrows
to know what it is all about, but I strangle her curiosity by saying:
“There are much cheaper typewriters than you are, my dear, and if you
try to pry into the sacred mysteries of this Club one of your
prosperities will perish sure.“</p>
<p>My favorite? It is “Joan of Arc.“ My next is “Huckleberry Finn,“ but
the family’s next is “The Prince and the Pauper.“ (Yes, you are right –I
am a moralist in disguise; it gets me into heaps of trouble when I go
thrashing around in political questions.)</p>
<p>I wish you every good fortune and happiness and I thank you so much
for your letter. Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Early in the year Clemens paid a visit to Twichell in Hartford, and
after one of their regular arguments on theology and the moral
accountability of the human race, arguments that had been going on
between them for more than thirty years–Twichell lent his visitor
Freedom of the Will, by Jonathan Edwards, to read on the way home. The
next letter was the result.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>RIVERDALE-ON-THE-HUDSON. Feb. ‘02. DEAR JOE,–“After
compliments.“–[Meaning “What a good time you gave me; what a happiness
it was to be under your roof again; etc., etc.“ See opening sentence of
all translations of letters passing between Lord Roberts and Indian
princes and rulers.]–From Bridgeport to New York; thence to home; and
continuously until near midnight I wallowed and reeked with Jonathan in
his insane debauch; rose immediately refreshed and fine at 10 this
morning, but with a strange and haunting sense of having been on a three
days’ tear with a drunken lunatic. It is years since I have known these
sensations. All through the book is the glaze of a resplendent intellect
gone mad–a marvelous spectacle. No, not all through the book–the drunk
does not come on till the last third, where what I take to be Calvinism
and its God begins to show up and shine red and hideous in the glow from
the fires of hell, their only right and proper adornment. By God I was
ashamed to be in such company.</p>
<p>Jonathan seems to hold (as against the Arminian position) that the
Man (or his Soul or his Will) never creates an impulse itself, but is
moved to action by an impulse back of it. That’s sound!</p>
<p>Also, that of two or more things offered it, it infallibly chooses
the one which for the moment is most pleasing to ITSELF. Perfectly
correct! An immense admission for a man not otherwise sane.</p>
<p>Up to that point he could have written chapters III and IV of my
suppressed “Gospel.“ But there we seem to separate. He seems to concede
the indisputable and unshakable dominion of Motive and Necessity (call
them what he may, these are exterior forces and not under the man’s
authority, guidance or even suggestion)–then he suddenly flies the logic
track and (to all seeming) makes the man and not these exterior forces
responsible to God for the man’s thoughts, words and acts. It is frank
insanity.</p>
<p>I think that when he concedes the autocratic dominion of Motive and
Necessity he grants, a third position of mine–that a man’s mind is a
mere machine–an automatic machine–which is handled entirely from the
outside, the man himself furnishing it absolutely nothing: not an ounce
of its fuel, and not so much as a bare suggestion to that exterior
engineer as to what the machine shall do, nor how it shall do it nor
when.</p>
<p>After that concession, it was time for him to get alarmed and
shirk–for he was pointing straight for the only rational and possible
next-station on that piece of road the irresponsibility of man to
God.</p>
<p>And so he shirked. Shirked, and arrived at this handsome result:</p>
<p>Man is commanded to do so-and-so. It has been ordained from the
beginning of time that some men shan’t and others can’t.</p>
<p>These are to be blamed: let them be damned.</p>
<p>I enjoy the Colonel very much, and shall enjoy the rest of him with
an obscene delight. Joe, the whole tribe shout love to you and yours!
MARK.</p>
<p>We have not heard of Joe Goodman since the trying days of ’90 and
’91, when he was seeking to promote the fortunes of the type-setting
machine. Goodman, meantime, who had in turn been miner, printer,
publisher, and farmer; had been devoting his energies and genius to
something entirely new: he had been translating the prehistoric Mayan
inscriptions of Yucatan, and with such success that his work was
elaborately published by an association of British scientists. In due
time a copy of this publication came to Clemens, who was full of
admiration of the great achievement.</p>
<p>To J. T. Goodman, in California:</p>
<p>RIVERDALE-ON-THE-HUDSON, June 13, ’02. DEAR JOE,–I am lost in
reverence and admiration! It is now twenty-four hours that I have been
trying to cool down and contemplate with quiet blood this extraordinary
spectacle of energy, industry, perseverance, pluck, analytical genius,
penetration, this irruption of thunders and fiery splendors from a fair
and flowery mountain that nobody had supposed was a sleeping volcano,
but I seem to be as excited as ever. Yesterday I read as much as half of
the book, not understanding a word but enchanted nevertheless–partly by
the wonder of it all, the study, the erudition, the incredible labor,
the modesty, the dignity, the majestic exclusiveness of the field and
its lofty remoteness from things and contacts sordid and mean and
earthy, and partly by the grace and beauty and limpidity of the book’s
unsurpassable English. Science, always great and worshipful, goes often
in hodden grey, but you have clothed her in garments meet for her high
degree.</p>
<p>You think you get “poor pay“ for your twenty years? No, oh no. You
have lived in a paradise of the intellect whose lightest joys were
beyond the reach of the longest purse in Christendom, you have had daily
and nightly emancipation from the world’s slaveries and gross interests,
you have received a bigger wage than any man in the land, you have
dreamed a splendid dream and had it come true, and to-day you could not
afford to trade fortunes with anybody–not even with another scientist,
for he must divide his spoil with his guild, whereas essentially the
world you have discovered is your own and must remain so.</p>
<p>It is all just magnificent, Joe! And no one is prouder or gladder
than Yours always MARK.</p>
<p>At York Harbor, Maine, where they had taken a cottage for the
summer–a pretty place, with Howells not far distant, at Kittery
Point–Mrs. Clemens’s health gave way. This was at a period when
telegraphic communication was far from reliable. The old-time Western
Union had fallen from grace; its “system“ no longer justified the best
significance of that word. The new day of reorganization was coming, and
it was time for it. Mark Twain’s letter concerning the service at York
Harbor would hardly be warranted today, but those who remember
conditions of that earlier time will agree that it was justified then,
and will appreciate its satire.</p>
<p>To the President of The Western Union, in New York:</p>
<p>“THE PINES“ YORK HARBOR, MAINE. DEAR SIR,–I desire to make a
complaint, and I bring it to you, the head of the company, because by
experience I know better than to carry it to a subordinate.</p>
<p>I have been here a month and a half, and by testimony of friends,
reinforced by personal experience I now feel qualified to claim as an
established fact that the telegraphic service here is the worst in the
world except that Boston.</p>
<p>These services are actually slower than was the New York and Hartford
service in the days when I last complained to you–which was fifteen or
eighteen years ago, when telegraphic time and train time between the
mentioned points was exactly the same, to-wit, three hours and a half.
Six days ago–it was that raw day which provoked so much comment–my
daughter was on her way up from New York, and at noon she telegraphed me
from New Haven asking that I meet her with a cloak at Portsmouth. Her
telegram reached me four hours and a quarter later–just 15 minutes too
late for me to catch my train and meet her.</p>
<p>I judge that the telegram traveled about 200 miles. It is the best
telegraphic work I have seen since I have been here, and I am mentioning
it in this place not as a complaint but as a compliment. I think a
compliment ought always to precede a complaint, where one is possible,
because it softens resentment and insures for the complaint a courteous
and gentle reception.</p>
<p>Still, there is a detail or two connected with this matter which
ought perhaps to be mentioned. And now, having smoothed the way with the
compliment, I will venture them. The head corpse in the York Harbor
office sent me that telegram altho (1) he knew it would reach me too
late to be of any value; (2) also, that he was going to send it to me by
his boy; (3) that the boy would not take the trolley and come the 2
miles in 12 minutes, but would walk; (4) that he would be two hours and
a quarter on the road; (5) and that he would collect 25 cents for
transportation, for a telegram which the he knew to be worthless before
he started it. From these data I infer that the Western Union owes me 75
cents; that is to say, the amount paid for combined wire and land
transportation –a recoup provided for in the printed paragraph which
heads the telegraph-blank.</p>
<p>By these humane and Christian stages we now arrive at the complaint
proper. We have had a grave case of illness in the family, and a
relative was coming some six hundred miles to help in the sick-room
during the convalescing period. It was an anxious time, of course, and I
wrote and asked to be notified as to the hour of the expected arrival of
this relative in Boston or in York Harbor. Being afraid of the
telegraph–which I think ought not to be used in times of hurry and
emergency–I asked that the desired message be brought to me by some
swift method of transportation. By the milkman, if he was coming this
way. But there are always people who think they know more than you do,
especially young people; so of course the young fellow in charge of this
lady used the telegraph. And at Boston, of all places! Except York
Harbor.</p>
<p>The result was as usual; let me employ a statelier and exacter term,
and say, historical.</p>
<p>The dispatch was handed to the h. c. of the Boston office at 9 this
morning. It said, “Shall bring A. S. to you eleven forty-five this
morning.“ The distance traveled by the dispatch is forty or fifty miles,
I suppose, as the train-time is five minutes short of two hours, and the
trains are so slow that they can’t give a W. U. telegram two hours and
twenty minutes start and overtake it.</p>
<p>As I have said, the dispatch was handed in at Boston at 9. The
expected visitors left Boston at 9.40, and reached my house at 12 noon,
beating the telegram 2 solid hours, and 5 minutes over.</p>
<p>The boy brought the telegram. It was bald-headed with age, but still
legible. The boy was prostrate with travel and exposure, but still
alive, and I went out to condole with him and get his last wishes and
send for the ambulance. He was waiting to collect transportation before
turning his passing spirit to less serious affairs. I found him
strangely intelligent, considering his condition and where he is getting
his training. I asked him at what hour the telegram was handed to the h.
c. in Boston. He answered brightly, that he didn’t know.</p>
<p>I examined the blank, and sure enough the wary Boston h. c. had
thoughtfully concealed that statistic. I asked him at what hour it had
started from Boston. He answered up as brightly as ever, and said he
didn’t know.</p>
<p>I examined the blank, and sure enough the Boston h. c. had left that
statistic out in the cold, too. In fact it turned out to be an official
concealment–no blank was provided for its exposure. And none required by
the law, I suppose. “It is a good one-sided idea,“ I remarked; “They can
take your money and ship your telegram next year if they want to–you’ve
no redress. The law ought to extend the privilege to all of us.“</p>
<p>The boy looked upon me coldly.</p>
<p>I asked him when the telegram reached York Harbor. He pointed to some
figures following the signature at the bottom of the blank–“12.14.“ I
said it was now 1.45 and asked–</p>
<p>“Do you mean that it reached your morgue an hour and a half ago?“</p>
<p>He nodded assent.</p>
<p>“It was at that time half an hour too late to be of any use to me, if
I wanted to go and meet my people–which was the case–for by the wording
of the message you can see that they were to arrive at the station at
11.45. Why did, your h. c. send me this useless message? Can’t he read?
Is he dead?“</p>
<p>“It’s the rules.“</p>
<p>“No, that does not account for it. Would he have sent it if it had
been three years old, I in the meantime deceased, and he aware of
it?“</p>
<p>The boy didn’t know.</p>
<p>“Because, you know, a rule which required him to forward to the
cemetery to-day a dispatch due three years ago, would be as good a rule
as one which should require him to forward a telegram to me to-day which
he knew had lost all its value an hour or two before he started it. The
construction of such a rule would discredit an idiot; in fact an idiot
–I mean a common ordinary Christian idiot, you understand–would be
ashamed of it, and for the sake of his reputation wouldn’t make it. What
do you think?“</p>
<p>He replied with much natural brilliancy that he wasn’t paid for
thinking.</p>
<p>This gave me a better opinion of the commercial intelligence
pervading his morgue than I had had before; it also softened my feelings
toward him, and also my tone, which had hitherto been tinged with
bitterness.</p>
<p>“Let bygones be bygones,“ I said, gently, “we are all erring
creatures, and mainly idiots, but God made us so and it is dangerous to
criticise.“ Sincerely S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>One day there arrived from Europe a caller with a letter of
introduction from Elizabeth, Queen of Rumania, better known as Carmen
Sylva. The visitor was Madam Hartwig, formerly an American girl,
returning now, because of reduced fortunes, to find profitable
employment in her own land. Her husband, a man of high principle, had
declined to take part in an “affair of honor,“ as recognized by the
Continental code; hence his ruin. Elizabeth of Rumania was one of the
most loved and respected of European queens and an author of
distinction. Mark Twain had known her in Vienna. Her letter to him and
his own letter to the public (perhaps a second one, for its date is two
years later) follow herewith.</p>
<p>From Carmen Sylva to Mark Twain:</p>
<p>BUCAREST, May 9, 1902. HONORED MASTER,–If I venture to address you on
behalf of a poor lady, who is stranded in Bucarest I hope not to be too
disagreeable.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartwig left America at the age of fourteen in order to learn to
sing which she has done thoroughly. Her husband had quite a brilliant
situation here till he refused to partake ‘dans une afaire onereuse’, so
it seems. They haven’t a penny and each of them must try to find a
living. She is very nice and pleasant and her school is so good that she
most certainly can give excellent singing lessons.</p>
<p>I beg your pardon for being a bore to one I so deeply love and
admire, to whom I owe days and days of forgetfulness of self and
troubles and the intensest of all joys: Hero-worship! People don’t
always realize what a happiness that is! God bless you for every
beautiful thought you poured into my tired heart and for every smile on
a weary way!</p>
<p>CARMEN SYLVA.</p>
<p>From Mark Twain to the Public:</p>
<p>Nov. 16, ’04. TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,–I desire to recommend Madame
Hartwig to my friends and the public as a teacher of singing and as a
concert-vocalist. She has lived for fifteen years at the court of
Roumania, and she brought with her to America an autograph letter in
which her Majesty the Queen of Roumania cordially certified her to me as
being an accomplished and gifted singer and teacher of singing, and
expressed a warm hope that her professional venture among us would meet
with success; through absence in Europe I have had no opportunity to
test the validity of the Queen’s judgment in the matter, but that
judgment is the utterance of an entirely competent authority–the best
that occupies a throne, and as good as any that sits elsewhere, as the
musical world well knows–and therefore back it without hesitation, and
endorse it with confidence.</p>
<p>I will explain that the reason her Majesty tried to do her friend a
friendly office through me instead of through someone else was, not that
I was particularly the right or best person for the office, but because
I was not a stranger. It is true that I am a stranger to some of the
monarchs–mainly through their neglect of their opportunities–but such is
not the case in the present instance. The latter fact is a high
compliment to me, and perhaps I ought to conceal it. Some people
would.</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens’s improvement was scarcely perceptible. It was not until
October that they were able to remove her to Riverdale, and then only in
a specially arranged invalid-car. At the end of the long journey she was
carried to her room and did not leave it again for many months.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>RIVERDALE, N. Y., Oct. 31, ’02. DEAR JOE,–It is ten days since Susy
[Twichell] wrote that you were laid up with a sprained shoulder, since
which time we have had no news about it. I hope that no news is good
news, according to the proverb; still, authoritative confirmation of it
will be gladly received in this family, if some of you will furnish it.
Moreover, I should like to know how and where it happened. In the
pulpit, as like as not, otherwise you would not be taking so much pains
to conceal it. This is not a malicious suggestion, and not a
personally-invented one: you told me yourself, once, that you threw
artificial power and impressiveness into places in your sermons where
needed, by “banging the bible“–(your own words.) You have reached a time
of life when it is not wise to take these risks. You would better jump
around. We all have to change our methods as the infirmities of age
creep upon us. Jumping around will be impressive now, whereas before you
were gray it would have excited remark.</p>
<p>Poor Livy drags along drearily. It must be hard times for that
turbulent spirit. It will be a long time before she is on her feet
again. It is a most pathetic case. I wish I could transfer it to myself.
Between ripping and raging and smoking and reading, I could get a good
deal of a holiday out of it.</p>
<p>Clara runs the house smoothly and capably. She is discharging a
trial-cook today and hiring another. A power of love to you all!

<p>Such was the state of Mrs. Clemens’s health that visitors were
excluded from the sick room, and even Clemens himself was allowed to see
her no more than a few moments at a time. These brief, precious visits
were the chief interests of his long days. Occasionally he was allowed
to send her a few lines, reporting his occupations, and these she was
sometimes permitted to answer. Only one of his notes has been preserved,
written after a day, now rare, of literary effort. Its signature, the
letter Y, stands for “Youth,“ always her name for him.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens:</p>
<p>DEAR HEART,–I’ve done another full day’s work, and finished before 4.
I have been reading and dozing since and would have had a real sleep a
few minutes ago but for an incursion to bring me a couple of unimportant
letters. I’ve stuck to the bed all day and am getting back my lost
ground. Next time I will be strictly careful and make my visit very
short–just a kiss and a rush. Thank you for your dear, dear note; you
who are my own and only sweetheart. Sleep well! Y.</p>
