<h4 id="chapter-v.">CHAPTER V.</h4>
<p>It were a weariness to follow in detail the leaps and bounds the
Foster fictitious finances took from this time forth. It was marvelous,
it was dizzying, it was dazzling. Everything Aleck touched turned to
fairy gold, and heaped itself glittering toward the firmament. Millions
upon millions poured in, and still the mighty stream flowed thundering
along, still its vast volume increased. Five millions –ten
millions–twenty–thirty–was there never to be an end?</p>
<p>Two years swept by in a splendid delirium, the intoxicated Fosters
scarcely noticing the flight of time. They were now worth three hundred
million dollars; they were in every board of directors of every
prodigious combine in the country; and still as time drifted along, the
millions went on piling up, five at a time, ten at a time, as fast as
they could tally them off, almost. The three hundred double itself–then
doubled again–and yet again–and yet once more.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hundred millions!</p>
<p>The business was getting a little confused. It was necessary to take
an account of stock, and straighten it out. The Fosters knew it, they
felt it, they realized that it was imperative; but they also knew that
to do it properly and perfectly the task must be carried to a finish
without a break when once it was begun. A ten-hours’ job; and where
could THEY find ten leisure hours in a bunch? Sally was selling pins and
sugar and calico all day and every day; Aleck was cooking and washing
dishes and sweeping and making beds all day and every day, with none to
help, for the daughters were being saved up for high society. The
Fosters knew there was one way to get the ten hours, and only one. Both
were ashamed to name it; each waited for the other to do it. Finally
Sally said:</p>
<p>“Somebody’s got to give in. It’s up to me. Consider that I’ve named
it–never mind pronouncing it out aloud.“</p>
<p>Aleck colored, but was grateful. Without further remark, they fell.
Fell, and–broke the Sabbath. For that was their only free ten-hour
stretch. It was but another step in the downward path. Others would
follow. Vast wealth has temptations which fatally and surely undermine
the moral structure of persons not habituated to its possession.</p>
<p>They pulled down the shades and broke the Sabbath. With hard and
patient labor they overhauled their holdings and listed them. And a
long-drawn procession of formidable names it was! Starting with the
Railway Systems, Steamer Lines, Standard Oil, Ocean Cables, Diluted
Telegraph, and all the rest, and winding up with Klondike, De Beers,
Tammany Graft, and Shady Privileges in the Post-office Department.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hundred millions, and all safely planted in Good Things,
gilt-edged and interest-bearing. Income, 20,000,000 a year. Aleck
fetched a long purr of soft delight, and said:</p>
<p>“Is it enough?“</p>
<p>“It is, Aleck.“</p>
<p>“What shall we do?“</p>
<p>“Stand pat.“</p>
<p>“Retire from business?“</p>
<p>“That’s it.“</p>
<p>“I am agreed. The good work is finished; we will take a long rest and
enjoy the money.“</p>
<p>“Good! Aleck!“</p>
<p>“Yes, dear?“</p>
<p>“How much of the income can we spend?“</p>
<p>“The whole of it.“</p>
<p>It seemed to her husband that a ton of chains fell from his limbs. He
did not say a word; he was happy beyond the power of speech.</p>
<p>After that, they broke the Sabbaths right along as fast as they
turned up. It is the first wrong step that counts. Every Sunday they put
in the whole day, after morning service, on inventions –inventions of
ways to spend the money. They got to continuing this delicious
dissipation until past midnight; and at every seance Aleck lavished
millions upon great charities and religious enterprises, and Sally
lavished like sums upon matters to which (at first) he gave definite
names. Only at first. Later the names gradually lost sharpness of
outline, and eventually faded into “sundries,“ thus becoming
entirely–but safely–undescriptive. For Sally was crumbling. The placing
of these millions added seriously and most uncomfortably to the family
expenses–in tallow candles. For a while Aleck was worried. Then, after a
little, she ceased to worry, for the occasion of it was gone. She was
pained, she was grieved, she was ashamed; but she said nothing, and so
became an accessory. Sally was taking candles; he was robbing the store.
It is ever thus. Vast wealth, to the person unaccustomed to it, is a
bane; it eats into the flesh and bone of his morals. When the Fosters
were poor, they could have been trusted with untold candles. But now
they–but let us not dwell upon it. From candles to apples is but a step:
Sally got to taking apples; then soap; then maple-sugar; then canned
goods; then crockery. How easy it is to go from bad to worse, when once
we have started upon a downward course!</p>
<p>Meantime, other effects had been milestoning the course of the
Fosters’ splendid financial march. The fictitious brick dwelling had
given place to an imaginary granite one with a checker-board mansard
roof; in time this one disappeared and gave place to a still grander
home–and so on and so on. Mansion after mansion, made of air, rose,
higher, broader, finer, and each in its turn vanished away; until now in
these latter great days, our dreamers were in fancy housed, in a distant
region, in a sumptuous vast palace which looked out from a leafy summit
upon a noble prospect of vale and river and receding hills steeped in
tinted mists –and all private, all the property of the dreamers; a
palace swarming with liveried servants, and populous with guests of fame
and power, hailing from all the world’s capitals, foreign and
domestic.</p>
<p>This palace was far, far away toward the rising sun, immeasurably
remote, astronomically remote, in Newport, Rhode Island, Holy Land of
High Society, ineffable Domain of the American Aristocracy. As a rule
they spent a part of every Sabbath–after morning service –in this
sumptuous home, the rest of it they spent in Europe, or in dawdling
around in their private yacht. Six days of sordid and plodding fact life
at home on the ragged edge of Lakeside and straitened means, the seventh
in Fairlyand–such had been their program and their habit.</p>
<p>In their sternly restricted fact life they remained as of old
–plodding, diligent, careful, practical, economical. They stuck loyally
to the little Presbyterian Church, and labored faithfully in its
interests and stood by its high and tough doctrines with all their
mental and spiritual energies. But in their dream life they obeyed the
invitations of their fancies, whatever they might be, and howsoever the
fancies might change. Aleck’s fancies were not very capricious, and not
frequent, but Sally’s scattered a good deal. Aleck, in her dream life,
went over to the Episcopal camp, on account of its large official
titles; next she became High-church on account of the candles and shows;
and next she naturally changed to Rome, where there were cardinals and
more candles. But these excursions were a nothing to Sally’s. His dream
life was a glowing and continuous and persistent excitement, and he kept
every part of it fresh and sparkling by frequent changes, the religious
part along with the rest. He worked his religions hard, and changed them
with his shirt.</p>
<p>The liberal spendings of the Fosters upon their fancies began early
in their prosperities, and grew in prodigality step by step with their
advancing fortunes. In time they became truly enormous. Aleck built a
university or two per Sunday; also a hospital or two; also a Rowton
hotel or so; also a batch of churches; now and then a cathedral; and
once, with untimely and ill-chosen playfulness, Sally said, “It was a
cold day when she didn’t ship a cargo of missionaries to persuade
unreflecting Chinamen to trade off twenty-four carat Confucianism for
counterfeit Christianity.“</p>
<p>This rude and unfeeling language hurt Aleck to the heart, and she
went from the presence crying. That spectacle went to his own heart, and
in his pain and shame he would have given worlds to have those unkind
words back. She had uttered no syllable of reproach –and that cut him.
Not one suggestion that he look at his own record –and she could have
made, oh, so many, and such blistering ones! Her generous silence
brought a swift revenge, for it turned his thoughts upon himself, it
summoned before him a spectral procession, a moving vision of his life
as he had been leading it these past few years of limitless prosperity,
and as he sat there reviewing it his cheeks burned and his soul was
steeped in humiliation. Look at her life–how fair it was, and tending
ever upward; and look at his own–how frivolous, how charged with mean
vanities, how selfish, how empty, how ignoble! And its trend–never
upward, but downward, ever downward!</p>
<p>He instituted comparisons between her record and his own. He had
found fault with her–so he mused–HE! And what could he say for himself?
When she built her first church what was he doing? Gathering other blase
multimillionaires into a Poker Club; defiling his own palace with it;
losing hundreds of thousands to it at every sitting, and sillily vain of
the admiring notoriety it made for him. When she was building her first
university, what was he doing? Polluting himself with a gay and
dissipated secret life in the company of other fast bloods,
multimillionaires in money and paupers in character. When she was
building her first foundling asylum, what was he doing? Alas! When she
was projecting her noble Society for the Purifying of the Sex, what was
he doing? Ah, what, indeed! When she and the W. C. T. U. and the Woman
with the Hatchet, moving with resistless march, were sweeping the fatal
bottle from the land, what was he doing? Getting drunk three times a
day. When she, builder of a hundred cathedrals, was being gratefully
welcomed and blest in papal Rome and decorated with the Golden Rose
which she had so honorably earned, what was he doing? Breaking the bank
at Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>He stopped. He could go no farther; he could not bear the rest. He
rose up, with a great resolution upon his lips: this secret life should
be revealing, and confessed; no longer would he live it clandestinely,
he would go and tell her All.</p>
<p>And that is what he did. He told her All; and wept upon her bosom;
wept, and moaned, and begged for her forgiveness. It was a profound
shock, and she staggered under the blow, but he was her own, the core of
her heart, the blessing of her eyes, her all in all, she could deny him
nothing, and she forgave him. She felt that he could never again be
quite to her what he had been before; she knew that he could only
repent, and not reform; yet all morally defaced and decayed as he was,
was he not her own, her very own, the idol of her deathless worship? She
said she was his serf, his slave, and she opened her yearning heart and
took him in.</p>
