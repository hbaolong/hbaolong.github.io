<h4 id="stirring-times-in-austria">STIRRING TIMES IN AUSTRIA</h4>
<p>I. THE GOVERNMENT IN THE FRYING-PAN.</p>
<p>Here in Vienna in these closing days of 1897 one’s blood gets no
chance to stagnate. The atmosphere is brimful of political electricity.
All conversation is political; every man is a battery, with brushes
overworn, and gives out blue sparks when you set him going on the common
topic. Everybody has an opinion, and lets you have it frank and hot, and
out of this multitude of counsel you get merely confusion and despair.
For no one really understands this political situation, or can tell you
what is going to be the outcome of it.</p>
<p>Things have happened here recently which would set any country but
Austria on fire from end to end, and upset the Government to a
certainty; but no one feels confident that such results will follow
here. Here, apparently, one must wait and see what will happen, then he
will know, and not before; guessing is idle; guessing cannot help the
matter. This is what the wise tell you; they all say it; they say it
every day, and it is the sole detail upon which they all agree.</p>
<p>There is some approach to agreement upon another point: that there
will be no revolution. Men say: ‘Look at our history, revolutions have
not been in our line; and look at our political map, its construction is
unfavourable to an organised uprising, and without unity what could a
revolt accomplish? It is disunion which has held our empire together for
centuries, and what it has done in the past it may continue to do now
and in the future.’</p>
<p>The most intelligible sketch I have encountered of this
unintelligible arrangement of things was contributed to the ‘Traveller’s
Record’ by Mr. Forrest Morgan, of Hartford, three years ago. He
says:</p>
<p>‘The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy is the patchwork-quilt, the Midway
Plaisance, the national chain-gang of Europe; a state that is not a
nation, but a collection of nations, some with national memories and
aspirations and others without, some occupying distinct provinces almost
purely their own, and others mixed with alien races, but each with a
different language, and each mostly holding the others foreigners as
much as if the link of a common government did not exist. Only one of
its races even now comprises so much as one-fourth of the whole, and not
another so much as one-sixth; and each has remained for ages as
unchanged in isolation, however mingled together in locality, as
globules of oil in water. There is nothing else in the modern world that
is nearly like it, though there have been plenty in past ages; it seems
unreal and impossible even though we know it is true; it violates all
our feeling as to what a country should be in order to have a right to
exist; and it seems as though it was too ramshackle to go on holding
together any length of time. Yet it has survived, much in its present
shape, two centuries of storms that have swept perfectly unified
countries from existence and others that have brought it to the verge of
ruin, has survived formidable European coalitions to dismember it, and
has steadily gained force after each; forever changing in its exact
make-up, losing in the West but gaining in the East, the changes leave
the structure as firm as ever, like the dropping off and adding on of
logs in a raft, its mechanical union of pieces showing all the vitality
of genuine national life.’</p>
<p>That seems to confirm and justify the prevalent Austrian faith that
in this confusion of unrelated and irreconcilable elements, this
condition of incurable disunion, there is strength–for the Government.
Nearly every day some one explains to me that a revolution would not
succeed here. ‘It couldn’t, you know. Broadly speaking, all the nations
in the empire hate the Government–but they all hate each other too, and
with devoted and enthusiastic bitterness; no two of them can combine;
the nation that rises must rise alone; then the others would joyfully
join the Government against her, and she would have just a fly’s chance
against a combination of spiders. This Government is entirely
independent. It can go its own road, and do as it pleases; it has
nothing to fear. In countries like England and America, where there is
one tongue and the public interests are common, the Government must take
account of public opinion; but in Austria-Hungary there are nineteen
public opinions–one for each state. No–two or three for each state,
since there are two or three nationalities in each. A Government cannot
satisfy all these public opinions; it can only go through the motions of
trying. This Government does that. It goes through the motions, and they
do not succeed; but that does not worry the Government much.’</p>
<p>The next man will give you some further information. ‘The Government
has a policy–a wise one–and sticks to it. This policy is–tranquillity:
keep this hive of excitable nations as quiet as possible; encourage them
to amuse themselves with things less inflammatory that politics. To this
end it furnishes them an abundance of Catholic priests to teach them to
be docile and obedient, and to be diligent in acquiring ignorance about
things here below, and knowledge about the kingdom of heaven, to whose
historic delights they are going to add the charm of their society
by-and-by; and further–to this same end–it cools off the newspapers
every morning at five o’clock, whenever warm events are happening.’
There is a censor of the press, and apparently he is always on duty and
hard at work. A copy of each morning paper is brought to him at five
o’clock. His official wagons wait at the doors of the newspaper offices
and scud to him with the first copies that come from the press. His
company of assistants read every line in these papers, and mark
everything which seems to have a dangerous look; then he passes final
judgment upon these markings. Two things conspire to give to the results
a capricious and unbalanced look: his assistants have diversified
notions as to what is dangerous and what isn’t; he can’t get time to
examine their criticisms in much detail; and so sometimes the very same
matter which is suppressed in one paper fails to be damned in another
one, and gets published in full feather and unmodified. Then the paper
in which it was suppressed blandly copies the forbidden matter into its
evening edition–provokingly giving credit and detailing all the
circumstances in courteous and inoffensive language–and of course the
censor cannot say a word.</p>
<p>Sometimes the censor sucks all the blood out of a newspaper and
leaves it colourless and inane; sometimes he leaves it undisturbed, and
lets it talk out its opinions with a frankness and vigour hardly to be
surpassed, I think, in the journals of any country. Apparently the
censor sometimes revises his verdicts upon second thought, for several
times lately he has suppressed journals after their issue and partial
distribution. The distributed copies are then sent for by the censor and
destroyed. I have two of these, but at the time they were sent for I
could not remember what I had done with them.</p>
<p>If the censor did his work before the morning edition was printed, he
would be less of an inconvenience than he is; but, of course, the papers
cannot wait many minutes after five o’clock to get his verdict; they
might as well go out of business as do that; so they print and take
their chances. Then, if they get caught by a suppression, they must
strike out the condemned matter and print the edition over again. That
delays the issue several hours, and is expensive besides. The Government
gets the suppressed edition for nothing. If it bought it, that would be
joyful, and would give great satisfaction. Also, the edition would be
larger. Some of the papers do not replace the condemned paragraphs with
other matter; they merely snatch they out and leave blanks
behind–mourning blanks, marked ‘Confiscated’.</p>
<p>The Government discourages the dissemination of newspaper information
in other ways. For instance, it does not allow newspapers to be sold on
the streets: therefore the newsboy is unknown in Vienna. And there is a
stamp duty of nearly a cent upon each copy of a newspaper’s issue. Every
American paper that reaches me has a stamp upon it, which has been
pasted there in the post-office or downstairs in the hotel office; but
no matter who put it there, I have to pay for it, and that is the main
thing. Sometimes friends send me so many papers that it takes all I can
earn that week to keep this Government going.</p>
<p>I must take passing notice of another point in the Government’s
measures for maintaining tranquillity. Everybody says it does not like
to see any individual attain to commanding influence in the country,
since such a man can become a disturber and an inconvenience. ‘We have
as much talent as the other nations,’ says the citizen, resignedly, and
without bitterness, ’but for the sake of the general good of the
country, we are discouraged from making it over-conspicuous; and not
only discouraged, but tactfully and skillfully prevented from doing it,
if we show too much persistence. Consequently we have no renowned men;
in centuries we have seldom produced one–that is, seldom allowed one to
produce himself. We can say to-day what no other nation of first
importance in the family of Christian civilisations can say–that there
exists no Austrian who has made an enduring name for himself which is
familiar all around the globe.</p>
<p>Another helper toward tranquillity is the army. It is as pervasive as
the atmosphere. It is everywhere. All the mentioned creators, promoters,
and preservers of the public tranquillity do their several shares in the
quieting work. They make a restful and comfortable serenity and
reposefulness. This is disturbed sometimes for a little while: a mob
assembles to protest against something; it gets noisy –noisier–still
noisier–finally too noisy; then the persuasive soldiery comes charging
down upon it, and in a few minutes all is quiet again, and there is no
mob.</p>
<p>There is a Constitution and there is a Parliament. The House draws
its membership of 425 deputies from the nineteen or twenty states
heretofore mentioned. These men represent peoples who speak eleven
different languages. That means eleven distinct varieties of jealousies,
hostilities, and warring interests. This could be expected to furnish
forth a parliament of a pretty inharmonious sort, and make legislation
difficult at times–and it does that. The Parliament is split up into
many parties–the Clericals, the Progressists, the German Nationalists,
the Young Czechs, the Social Democrats, the Christian Socialists, and
some others–and it is difficult to get up working combinations among
them. They prefer to fight apart sometimes.</p>
<p>The recent troubles have grown out of Count Badeni’s necessities. He
could not carry on his Government without a majority vote in the House
at his back, and in order to secure it he had to make a trade of some
sort. He made it with the Czechs–the Bohemians. The terms were not easy
for him: he must issue an ordinance making the Czech tongue the official
language in Bohemia in place of the German. This created a storm. All
the Germans in Austria were incensed. In numbers they form but a fourth
part of the empire’s population, but they urge that the country’s public
business should be conducted in one common tongue, and that tongue a
world language–which German is.</p>
<p>However, Badeni secured his majority. The German element in
Parliament was apparently become helpless. The Czech deputies were
exultant.</p>
<p>Then the music began. Badeni’s voyage, instead of being smooth, was
disappointingly rough from the start. The Government must get the
Ausgleich through. It must not fail. Badeni’s majority was ready to
carry it through; but the minority was determined to obstruct it and
delay it until the obnoxious Czech-language measure should be
shelved.</p>
<p>The Ausgleich is an Adjustment, Arrangement, Settlement, which holds
Austria and Hungary together. It dates from 1867, and has to be renewed
every ten years. It establishes the share which Hungary must pay toward
the expenses of the imperial Government. Hungary is a kingdom (the
Emperor of Austria is its King), and has its own Parliament and
governmental machinery. But it has no foreign office, and it has no
army–at least its army is a part of the imperial army, is paid out of
the imperial treasury, and is under the control of the imperial war
office.</p>
<p>The ten-year arrangement was due a year ago, but failed to connect.
At least completely. A year’s compromise was arranged. A new arrangement
must be effected before the last day of this year. Otherwise the two
countries become separate entities. The Emperor would still be King of
Hungary–that is, King of an independent foreign country. There would be
Hungarian custom-houses on the Austrian border, and there would be a
Hungarian army and a Hungarian foreign office. Both countries would be
weakened by this, both would suffer damage.</p>
<p>The Opposition in the House, although in the minority, had a good
weapon to fight with in the pending Ausgleich. If it could delay the
Ausgleich a few weeks, the Government would doubtless have to withdraw
the hated language ordinance or lose Hungary.</p>
<p>The Opposition began its fight. Its arms were the Rules of the House.
It was soon manifest that by applying these Rules ingeniously it could
make the majority helpless, and keep it so as long as it pleased. It
could shut off business every now and then with a motion to adjourn. It
could require the ayes and noes on the motion, and use up thirty minutes
on that detail. It could call for the reading and verification of the
minutes of the preceding meeting, and use up half a day in that way. It
could require that several of its members be entered upon the list of
permitted speakers previously to the opening of a sitting; and as there
is no time-limit, further delays could thus be accomplished.</p>
<p>These were all lawful weapons, and the men of the Opposition
(technically called the Left) were within their rights in using them.
They used them to such dire purpose that all parliamentary business was
paralysed. The Right (the Government side) could accomplish nothing.
Then it had a saving idea. This idea was a curious one. It was to have
the President and the Vice-Presidents of the Parliament trample the
Rules under foot upon occasion!</p>
<p>This, for a profoundly embittered minority constructed out of fire
and gun-cotton! It was time for idle strangers to go and ask leave to
look down out of a gallery and see what would be the result of it.</p>
<ol start="2" type="I">
<li>A MEMORABLE SITTING.</li>
</ol>
<p>And now took place that memorable sitting of the House which broke
two records. It lasted the best part of two days and a night, surpassing
by half an hour the longest sitting known to the world’s previous
parliamentary history, and breaking the long-speech record with
Dr. Lecher’s twelve-hour effort, the longest flow of unbroken talk that
ever came out of one mouth since the world began.</p>
<p>At 8.45 on the evening of the 28th of October, when the House had
been sitting a few minutes short of ten hours, Dr. Lecher was granted
the floor. It was a good place for theatrical effects. I think that no
other Senate House is so shapely as this one, or so richly and showily
decorated. Its plan is that of an opera-house. Up toward the straight
side of it–the stage side–rise a couple of terraces of desks for the
ministry, and the official clerks or secretaries–terraces thirty feet
long, and each supporting about half a dozen desks with spaces between
them. Above these is the President’s terrace, against the wall. Along it
are distributed the proper accommodations for the presiding officer and
his assistants. The wall is of richly coloured marble highly polished,
its paneled sweep relieved by fluted columns and pilasters of
distinguished grace and dignity, which glow softly and frostily in the
electric light. Around the spacious half-circle of the floor bends the
great two-storied curve of the boxes, its frontage elaborately
ornamented and sumptuously gilded. On the floor of the House the 425
desks radiate fanwise from the President’s tribune.</p>
<p>The galleries are crowded on this particular evening, for word has
gone about that the Ausgleich is before the House; that the President,
Ritter von Abrahamowicz, has been throttling the Rules; that the
Opposition are in an inflammable state in consequence, and that the
night session is likely to be of an exciting sort.</p>
<p>The gallery guests are fashionably dressed, and the finery of the
women makes a bright and pretty show under the strong electric light.
But down on the floor there is no costumery.</p>
<p>The deputies are dressed in day clothes; some of the clothes neat and
trim, others not; there may be three members in evening dress, but not
more. There are several Catholic priests in their long black gowns, and
with crucifixes hanging from their necks. No member wears his hat. One
may see by these details that the aspects are not those of an evening
sitting of an English House of Commons, but rather those of a sitting of
our House of Representatives.</p>
<p>In his high place sits the President, Abrahamowicz, object of the
Opposition’s limitless hatred. He is sunk back in the depths of his
arm-chair, and has his chin down. He brings the ends of his spread
fingers together, in front of his breast, and reflectively taps them
together, with the air of one who would like to begin business, but must
wait, and be as patient as he can. It makes you think of Richelieu. Now
and then he swings his head up to the left or to the right and answers
something which some one has bent down to say to him. Then he taps his
fingers again. He looks tired, and maybe a trifle harassed. He is a
gray-haired, long, slender man, with a colourless long face, which, in
repose, suggests a death-mask; but when not in repose is tossed and
rippled by a turbulent smile which washes this way and that, and is not
easy to keep up with–a pious smile, a holy smile, a saintly smile, a
deprecating smile, a beseeching and supplicating smile; and when it is
at work the large mouth opens, and the flexible lips crumple, and
unfold, and crumple again, and move around in a genial and persuasive
and angelic way, and expose large glimpses of the teeth; and that
interrupts the sacredness of the smile and gives it momentarily a mixed
worldly and political and satanic cast. It is a most interesting face to
watch. And then the long hands and the body–they furnish great and
frequent help to the face in the business of adding to the force of the
statesman’s words.</p>
<p>To change the tense. At the time of which I have just been speaking
the crowds in the galleries were gazing at the stage and the pit with
rapt interest and expectancy. One half of the great fan of desks was in
effect empty, vacant; in the other half several hundred members were
bunched and jammed together as solidly as the bristles in a brush; and
they also were waiting and expecting. Presently the Chair delivered this
utterance:</p>
<p>‘Dr. Lecher has the floor.’</p>
<p>Then burst out such another wild and frantic and deafening clamour as
has not been heard on this planet since the last time the Comanches
surprised a white settlement at night. Yells from the Left,
counter-yells from the Right, explosions of yells from all sides at
once, and all the air sawed and pawed and clawed and cloven by a
writhing confusion of gesturing arms and hands. Out of the midst of this
thunder and turmoil and tempest rose Dr. Lecher, serene and collected,
and the providential length of his enabled his head to show out of it.
He began his twelve-hour speech. At any rate, his lips could be seen to
move, and that was evidence. On high sat the President, imploring order,
with his long hands put together as in prayer, and his lips visibly but
not hearably speaking. At intervals he grasped his bell and swung it up
and down with vigour, adding its keen clamour to the storm weltering
there below.</p>
<p>Dr. Lecher went on with his pantomime speech, contented, untroubled.
Here and there and now and then powerful voices burst above the din, and
delivered an ejaculation that was heard. Then the din ceased for a
moment or two, and gave opportunity to hear what the Chair might answer;
then the noise broke out again. Apparently the President was being
charged with all sorts of illegal exercises of power in the interest of
the Right (the Government side): among these, with arbitrarily closing
an Order of Business before it was finished; with an unfair distribution
of the right to the floor; with refusal of the floor, upon quibble and
protest, to members entitled to it; with stopping a speaker’s speech
upon quibble and protest; and with other transgressions of the Rules of
the House. One of the interrupters who made himself heard was a young
fellow of slight build and neat dress, who stood a little apart from the
solid crowd and leaned negligently, with folded arms and feet crossed,
against a desk. Trim and handsome; strong face and thin features; black
hair roughed up; parsimonious moustache; resonant great voice, of good
tone and pitch. It is Wolf, capable and hospitable with sword and
pistol; fighter of the recent duel with Count Badeni, the head of the
Government. He shot Badeni through the arm and then walked over in the
politest way and inspected his game, shook hands, expressed regret, and
all that. Out of him came early this thundering peal, audible above the
storm:</p>
<p>‘I demand the floor. I wish to offer a motion.’</p>
<p>In the sudden lull which followed, the President answered,
‘Dr. Lecher has the floor.’</p>
<p>Wolf. ‘I move the close of the sitting!’</p>
<p>P. ‘Representative Lecher has the floor.’ [Stormy outburst from the
Left–that is, the Opposition.]</p>
<p>Wolf. ‘I demand the floor for the introduction of a formal notion.
[Pause]. Mr. President, are you going to grant it, or not? [Crash of
approval from the Left.] I will keep on demanding the floor till I get
it.’</p>
<p>P. ‘I call Representative Wolf to order. Dr. Lecher has the
floor.’</p>
<p>Wolf. ‘Mr. President, are you going to observe the Rules of this
House?’ [Tempest of applause and confused ejaculations from the Left–a
boom and roar which long endured, and stopped all business for the time
being.]</p>
<p>Dr. von Pessler. ‘By the Rules motions are in order, and the Chair
must put them to vote.’</p>
<p>For answer the President (who is a Pole–I make this remark in
passing) began to jangle his bell with energy at the moment that that
wild pandemonium of voices broke out again.</p>
<p>Wolf (hearable above the storm). ‘Mr. President, I demand the floor.
We intend to find out, here and now, which is the hardest, a Pole’s
skull or a German’s!’</p>
<p>This brought out a perfect cyclone of satisfaction from the Left. In
the midst of it someone again moved an Adjournment. The President
blandly answered that Dr. Lecher had the floor. Which was true; and he
was speaking, too, calmly, earnestly, and argumentatively; and the
official stenographers had left their places and were at his elbows
taking down his words, he leaning and orating into their ears–a most
curious and interesting scene.</p>
<p>Dr. von Pessler (to the Chair). ‘Do not drive us to extremities!’</p>
<p>The tempest burst out again: yells of approval from the Left,
catcalls and ironical laughter from the Right. At this point a new and
most effective noise-maker was pressed into service. Each desk has an
extension, consisting of a removable board eighteen inches long, six
wide, and a half-inch thick. A member pulled one of these out and began
to belabour the top of his desk with it. Instantly other members
followed suit, and perhaps you can imagine the result. Of all
conceivable rackets it is the most ear-splitting, intolerable, and
altogether fiendish.</p>
<p>The persecuted President leaned back in his chair, closed his eyes,
clasped his hands in his lap, and a look of pathetic resignation crept
over his long face. It is the way a country schoolmaster used to look in
days long past when he had refused his school a holiday and it had risen
against him in ill-mannered riot and violence and insurrection. Twice a
motion to adjourn had been offered–a motion always in order in other
Houses, and doubtless so in this one also. The President had refused to
put these motions. By consequence, he was not in a pleasant place now,
and was having a right hard time. Votes upon motions, whether carried or
defeated, could make endless delay, and postpone the Ausgleich to next
century.</p>
<p>In the midst of these sorrowful circumstances and this hurricane of
yells and screams and satanic clatter of desk-boards, Representative
Dr. Kronawetter unfeelingly reminds the Chair that a motion has been
offered, and adds: ‘Say yes, or no! What do you sit there for, and give
no answer?’</p>
<p>P. ‘After I have given a speaker the floor, I cannot give it to
another. After Dr. Lecher is through, I will put your motion.’ [Storm of
indignation from the Left.]</p>
<p>Wolf (to the Chair). ‘Thunder and lightning! look at the Rule
governing the case!’</p>
<p>Kronawetter. ‘I move the close of the sitting! And I demand the ayes
and noes!’</p>
<p>Dr. Lecher. ‘Mr. President, have I the floor?’</p>
<p>P. ‘You have the floor.’</p>
<p>Wolf (to the Chair, in a stentorian voice which cleaves its way
through the storm). ‘It is by such brutalities as these that you drive
us to extremities! Are you waiting till someone shall throw into your
face the word that shall describe what you are bringing about?[1]
[Tempest of insulted fury from the Right.] Is that what you are waiting
for, old Grayhead?’ [Long-continued clatter of desk-boards from the
Left, with shouts of ‘The vote! the vote!’ An ironical shout from the
Right, ‘Wolf is boss!’]</p>
<p>Wolf keeps on demanding the floor for his motion. At length–</p>
<p>P. ‘I call Representative Wolf to order! Your conduct is unheard of,
sir! You forget that you are in a parliament; you must remember where
you are, sir.’ [Applause from the Right. Dr. Lecher is still peacefully
speaking, the stenographers listening at his lips.]</p>
<p>Wolf (banging on his desk with his desk-board). ‘I demand the floor
for my motion! I won’t stand this trampling of the Rules under foot–no,
not if I die for it! I will never yield. You have got to stop me by
force. Have I the floor?’</p>
<p>P. ‘Representative Wolf, what kind of behaviour is this? I call you
to order again. You should have some regard for your dignity.’</p>
<p>Dr. Lecher speaks on. Wolf turns upon him with an offensive
innuendo.</p>
<p>Dr. Lecher. ‘Mr. Wolf, I beg you to refrain from that sort of
suggestions.’ [Storm of hand-clapping from the Right.]</p>
<p>This was applause from the enemy, for Lecher himself, like Wolf, was
an Obstructionist.</p>
<p>Wolf growls to Lecher, ‘You can scribble that applause in your
album!’</p>
<p>P. ‘Once more I call Representative Wolf to order! Do not forget that
you are a Representative, sir!’</p>
<p>Wolf (slam-banging with his desk-board). ‘I will force this matter!
Are you going to grant me the floor, or not?’</p>
<p>And still the sergeant-at-arms did not appear. It was because there
wasn’t any. It is a curious thing, but the Chair has no effectual means
of compelling order.</p>
<p>After some more interruptions:</p>
<p>Wolf (banging with his board). ‘I demand the floor. I will not
yield!’</p>
<p>P. ‘I have no recourse against Representative Wolf. In the presence
of behaviour like this it is to be regretted that such is the case.’ [A
shout from the Right, ‘Throw him out!’]</p>
<p>It is true he had no effective recourse. He had an official called an
‘Ordner,’ whose help he could invoke in desperate cases, but apparently
the Ordner is only a persuader, not a compeller. Apparently he is a
sergeant-at-arms who is not loaded; a good enough gun to look at, but
not valuable for business.</p>
<p>For another twenty or thirty minutes Wolf went on banging with his
board and demanding his rights; then at last the weary President
threatened to summon the dread order-maker. But both his manner and his
words were reluctant. Evidently it grieved him to have to resort to this
dire extremity. He said to Wolf, ‘If this goes on, I shall feel obliged
to summon the Ordner, and beg him to restore order in the House.’</p>
<p>Wolf. ‘I’d like to see you do it! Suppose you fetch in a few
policemen too! [Great tumult.] Are you going to put my motion to
adjourn, or not?’</p>
<p>Dr. Lecher continues his speech. Wolf accompanies him with his
board-clatter.</p>
<p>The President despatches the Ordner, Dr. Lang (himself a deputy), on
his order-restoring mission. Wolf, with his board uplifted for defence,
confronts the Ordner with a remark which Boss Tweed might have
translated into ‘Now let’s see what you are going to do about it!’
[Noise and tumult all over the House.]</p>
<p>Wolf stands upon his rights, and says he will maintain them until he
is killed in his tracks. Then he resumes his banging, the President
jangles his bell and begs for order, and the rest of the House augments
the racket the best it can.</p>
<p>Wolf. ‘I require an adjournment, because I find myself personally
threatened. [Laughter from the Right.] Not that I fear for myself; I am
only anxious about what will happen to the man who touches me.’</p>
<p>The Ordner. ‘I am not going to fight with you.’</p>
<p>Nothing came of the efforts of the angel of peace, and he presently
melted out of the scene and disappeared. Wolf went on with his noise and
with his demands that he be granted the floor, resting his board at
intervals to discharge criticisms and epithets at the Chair. Once he
reminded the Chairman of his violated promise to grant him (Wolf) the
floor, and said, ‘Whence I came, we call promise-breakers rascals!’ And
he advised the Chairman to take his conscience to bed with him and use
it as a pillow. Another time he said that the Chair was making itself
ridiculous before all Europe. In fact, some of Wolf’s language was
almost unparliamentary. By-and-by he struck the idea of beating out a
tune with his board. Later he decided to stop asking for the floor, and
to confer it upon himself. And so he and Dr. Lecher now spoke at the
same time, and mingled their speeches with the other noises, and nobody
heard either of them. Wolf rested himself now and then from
speech-making by reading, in his clarion voice, from a pamphlet.</p>
<p>I will explain that Dr. Lecher was not making a twelve-hour speech
for pastime, but for an important purpose. It was the Government’s
intention to push the Ausgleich through its preliminary stages in this
one sitting (for which it was the Order of the Day), and then by vote
refer it to a select committee. It was the Majority’s scheme–as charged
by the Opposition–to drown debate upon the bill by pure noise–drown it
out and stop it. The debate being thus ended, the vote upon the
reference would follow–with victory for the Government. But into the
Government’s calculations had not entered the possibility of a
single-barrelled speech which should occupy the entire time-limit of the
setting, and also get itself delivered in spite of all the noise.
Goliath was not expecting David. But David was there; and during twelve
hours he tranquilly pulled statistical, historical, and argumentative
pebbles out of his scrip and slung them at the giant; and when he was
done he was victor, and the day was saved.</p>
<p>In the English House an obstructionist has held the floor with
Bible-readings and other outside matters; but Dr. Lecher could not have
that restful and recuperative privilege–he must confine himself strictly
to the subject before the House. More than once, when the President
could not hear him because of the general tumult, he sent persons to
listen and report as to whether the orator was speaking to the subject
or not.</p>
<p>The subject was a peculiarly difficult one, and it would have
troubled any other deputy to stick to it three hours without exhausting
his ammunition, because it required a vast and intimate
knowledge–detailed and particularised knowledge–of the commercial,
railroading, financial, and international banking relations existing
between two great sovereignties, Hungary and the Empire. But Dr. Lecher
is President of the Board of Trade of his city of Brunn, and was master
of the situation. His speech was not formally prepared. He had a few
notes jotted down for his guidance; he had his facts in his head; his
heard was in his work; and for twelve hours he stood there, undisturbed
by the clamour around him, and with grace and ease and confidence poured
out the riches of his mind, in closely reasoned arguments, clothed in
eloquent and faultless phrasing.</p>
<p>He is a young man of thirty-seven. He is tall and well-proportioned,
and has cultivated and fortified his muscle by mountain-climbing. If he
were a little handsomer he would sufficiently reproduce for me the
Chauncey Depew of the great New England dinner nights of some years ago;
he has Depew’s charm of manner and graces of language and delivery.</p>
<p>There was but one way for Dr. Lecher to hold the floor–he must stay
on his legs. If he should sit down to rest a moment, the floor would be
taken from him by the enemy in the Chair. When he had been talking three
or four hours he himself proposed an adjournment, in order that he might
get some rest from his wearing labours; but he limited his motion with
the condition that if it was lost he should be allowed to continue his
speech, and if it was carried he should have the floor at the next
sitting. Wolf was now appeased, and withdrew his own
thousand-times-offered motion, and Dr. Lecher’s was voted upon–and lost.
So he went on speaking.</p>
<p>By one o’clock in the morning, excitement and noise-making had tired
out nearly everybody but the orator. Gradually the seats of the Right
underwent depopulation; the occupants had slipped out to the
refreshment-rooms to eat and drink, or to the corridors to chat. Some
one remarked that there was no longer a quorum present, and moved a call
of the House. The Chair (Vice-President Dr. Kramarz) refused to put it
to vote. There was a small dispute over the legality of this ruling, but
the Chair held its ground.</p>
<p>The Left remained on the battle-field to support their champion. He
went steadily on with his speech; and always it was strong, virile,
felicitous, and to the point. He was earning applause, and this enabled
his party to turn that fact to account. Now and then they applauded him
a couple of minutes on a stretch, and during that time he could stop
speaking and rest his voice without having the floor taken from him.</p>
<p>At a quarter to two a member of the Left demanded that Dr. Lecher be
allowed a recess for rest, and said that the Chairman was ‘heartless.’
Dr. Lecher himself asked for ten minutes. The Chair allowed him five.
Before the time had run out Dr. Lecher was on his feet again.</p>
<p>Wolf burst out again with a motion to adjourn. Refused by the Chair.
Wolf said the whole Parliament wasn’t worth a pinch of powder. The Chair
retorted that that was true in a case where a single member was able to
make all parliamentary business impossible. Dr. Lecher continued his
speech.</p>
<p>The members of the Majority went out by detachments from time to time
and took naps upon sofas in the reception-rooms; and also refreshed
themselves with food and drink–in quantities nearly unbelievable–but the
Minority stayed loyally by their champion. Some distinguished deputies
of the Majority stayed by him too, compelled thereto by admiration of
his great performance. When a man has been speaking eight hours, is it
conceivable that he can still be interesting, still fascinating? When
Dr. Lecher had been speaking eight hours he was still compactly
surrounded by friends who would not leave him, and by foes (of all
parties) who could not; and all hung enchanted and wondering upon his
words, and all testified their admiration with constant and cordial
outbursts of applause. Surely this was a triumph without precedent in
history.</p>
<p>During the twelve-hour effort friends brought to the orator three
glasses of wine, four cups of coffee, and one glass of beer–a most
stingy re-enforcement of his wasting tissues, but the hostile Chair
would permit no addition to it. But, no matter, the Chair could not beat
that man. He was a garrison holding a fort, and was not to be starved
out.</p>
<p>When he had been speaking eight hours his pulse was 72; when he had
spoken twelve, it was 100.</p>
<p>He finished his long speech in these terms, as nearly as a
permissibly free translation can convey them:</p>
<p>’I will now hasten to close my examination of the subject. I conceive
that we of the Left have made it clear to the honourable gentlemen of
the other side of the House that we are stirred by no intemperate
enthusiasm for this measure in its present shape….</p>
<p>’What we require, and shall fight for with all lawful weapons, is a
formal, comprehensive, and definitive solution and settlement of these
vexed matters. We desire the restoration of the earlier condition of
things; the cancellation of all this incapable Government’s pernicious
trades with Hungary; and then–release from the sorry burden of the
Badeni ministry!</p>
<p>‘I voice the hope–I know not if it will be fulfilled–I voice the deep
and sincere and patriotic hope that the committee into whose hands this
bill will eventually be committed will take its stand upon high ground,
and will return the Ausgleich-Provisorium to this House in a form which
shall make it the protector and promoter alike of the great interests
involved and of the honour of our fatherland.’ After a pause, turning
towards the Government benches: ‘But in any case, gentlemen of the
Majority, make sure of this: henceforth, as before, you find us at our
post. The Germans of Austria will neither surrender nor die!’</p>
<p>Then burst a storm of applause which rose and fell, rose and fell,
burst out again and again and again, explosion after explosion,
hurricane after hurricane, with no apparent promise of ever coming to an
end; and meantime the whole Left was surging and weltering about the
champion, all bent upon wringing his hand and congratulating him and
glorifying him.</p>
<p>Finally he got away, and went home and ate five loaves and twelve
baskets of fish, read the morning papers, slept three hours, took a
short drive, then returned to the House, and sat out the rest of the
thirty-three-hour session.</p>
<p>To merely stand up in one spot twelve hours on a stretch is a feat
which very few men could achieve; to add to the task the utterance of a
hundred thousand words would be beyond the possibilities of the most of
those few; to superimpose the requirement that the words should be put
into the form of a compact, coherent, and symmetrical oration would
probably rule out the rest of the few, bar Dr. Lecher.</p>
<p>III.–CURIOUS PARLIAMENTARY ETIQUETTE.</p>
<p>In consequence of Dr. Lecher’s twelve-hour speech and the other
obstructions furnished by the Minority, the famous thirty-three-hour
sitting of the House accomplished nothing. The Government side had made
a supreme effort, assisting itself with all the helps at hand, both
lawful and unlawful, yet had failed to get the Ausgleich into the hands
of a committee. This was a severe defeat. The Right was mortified, the
Left jubilant.</p>
<p>Parliament was adjourned for a week–to let the members cool off,
perhaps–a sacrifice of precious time; for but two months remained in
which to carry the all-important Ausgleich to a consummation.</p>
<p>If I have reported the behaviour of the House intelligibly, the
reader has been surprised by it, and has wondered whence these
law-makers come and what they are made of; and he has probably supposed
that the conduct exhibited at the Long Sitting was far out of the
common, and due to special excitement and irritation. As to the make-up
of the House, it is this: the deputies come from all the walks of life
and from all the grades of society. There are princes, counts, barons,
priests, peasants, mechanics, labourers, lawyers, judges, physicians,
professors, merchants, bankers, shopkeepers. They are religious men,
they are earnest, sincere, devoted, and they hate the Jews. The title of
Doctor is so common in the House that one may almost say that the deputy
who does not bear it is by that reason conspicuous. I am assured that it
is not a self-granted title, and not an honorary one, but an earned one;
that in Austria it is very seldom conferred as a mere compliment; that
in Austria the degrees of Doctor of Music, Doctor of Philosophy, and so
on, are not conferred by the seats of learning; and so, when an Austrian
is called Doctor, it means that he is either a lawyer or a physician,
and that he is not a self-educated man, but is college-bred, and has
been diplomaed for merit.</p>
<p>That answers the question of the constitution of the House. Now as to
the House’s curious manners. The manners exhibited by this convention of
Doctors were not at that time being tried as a wholly new experiment. I
will go back to a previous sitting in order to show that the deputies
had already had some practice.</p>
<p>There had been an incident. The dignity of the House had been wounded
by improprieties indulged in in its presence by a couple of the members.
This matter was placed in the hands of a committee to determine where
the guilt lay and the degree of it, and also to suggest the punishment.
The chairman of the committee brought in his report. By this it appeared
that in the course of a speech, Deputy Schrammel said that religion had
no proper place in the public schools–it was a private matter. Whereupon
Deputy Gregorig shouted, ‘How about free love!’</p>
<p>To this, Deputy Iro flung out this retort: ‘Soda-water at the
Wimberger!’</p>
<p>This appeared to deeply offend Deputy Gregorig, who shouted back at
Iro, ‘You cowardly blatherskite, say that again!’</p>
<p>The committee had sat three hours. Gregorig had apologised. Iro
explained that he didn’t say anything about soda-water at the Wimberger.
He explained in writing, and was very explicit: ‘I declare upon my word
of honour that I did not say the words attributed to me.’</p>
<p>Unhappily for his word of honour, it was proved by the official
stenographers and by the testimony of several deputies that he did say
them.</p>
<p>The committee did not officially know why the apparently
inconsequential reference to soda-water at the Wimberger should move
Deputy Gregorig to call the utterer of it a cowardly blatherskite;
still, after proper deliberation, it was of the opinion that the House
ought to formally censure the whole business. This verdict seems to have
been regarded as sharply severe. I think so because Deupty Dr. Lueger,
Burgermeister of Vienna, felt it a duty to soften the blow to his friend
Gregorig by showing that the soda-water remark was not so innocuous as
it might look; that, indeed, Gregorig’s tough retory was justifiable–and
he proceeded to explain why. He read a number of scandalous post-cards
which he intimated had proceeded from Iro, as indicated by the
handwriting, though they were anonymous. Some of them were posted to
Gregorig at his place of business and could have been read by all his
subordinates; the others were posted to Gregorig’s wife. Lueger did not
say–but everybody knew –that the cards referred to a matter of town
gossip which made Mr. Gregorig a chief actor in a tavern scene where
siphon-squirting played a prominent and humorous part, and wherein women
had a share.</p>
<p>There were several of the cards; more than several, in fact; no fewer
than five were sent in one day. Dr. Lueger read some of them, and
described others. Some of them had pictures on them; one a picture of a
hog with a monstrous snout, and beside it a squirting soda-siphon; below
it some sarcastic doggerel.</p>
<p>Gregorig dealt in shirts, cravats, etc. One of the cards bore these
words: ‘Much-respected Deputy and collar-sewer–or stealer.’</p>
<p>Another: ‘Hurrah for the Christian-Social work among the
women-assemblages! Hurrah for the soda-squirter!’ Comment by Dr. Lueger:
‘I cannot venture to read the rest of that one, nor the signature,
either.’</p>
<p>Another: ‘Would you mind telling me if….’ Comment by Dr. Lueger: ‘The
rest of it is not properly readable.’</p>
<p>To Deputy Gregorig’s wife: ‘Much-respected Madam Gregorig,–The
undersigned desires an invitation to the next soda-squirt.’ Comment by
Dr. Lueger: ‘Neither the rest of the card nor the signature can I
venture to read to the House, so vulgar are they.’</p>
<p>The purpose of this card–to expose Gregorig to his family–was
repeated in others of these anonymous missives.</p>
<p>The House, by vote, censured the two improper deputies.</p>
<p>This may have had a modifying effect upon the phraseology of the
membership for a while, and upon its general exuberance also, but it was
not for long. As has been seen, it had become lively once more on the
night of the Long Sitting. At the next sitting after the long one there
was certainly no lack of liveliness. The President was persistently
ignoring the Rules of the House in the interest of the government side,
and the Minority were in an unappeasable fury about it. The ceaseless
din and uproar, the shouting and stamping and desk-banging, were
deafening, but through it all burst voices now and then that made
themselves heard. Some of the remarks were of a very candid sort, and I
believe that if they had been uttered in our House of Representatives
they would have attracted attention. I will insert some samples here.
Not in their order, but selected on their merits:</p>
<p>Mr. Mayreder (to the President). ‘You have lied! You conceded the
floor to me; make it good, or you have lied!’</p>
<p>Mr. Glockner (to the President). ‘Leave! Get out!’</p>
<p>Wolf (indicating the President). ‘There sits a man to whom a certain
title belongs!’</p>
<p>Unto Wolf, who is continuously reading, in a powerful voice, from a
newspaper, arrive these personal remarks from the Majority: ‘Oh, shut
your mouth!’ ‘Put him out!’ ‘Out with him!’ Wolf stops reading a moment
to shout at Dr. Lueger, who has the floor but cannot get a hearing,
‘Please, Betrayer of the People, begin!’</p>
<p>Dr. Lueger, ‘Meine Herren–’ [‘Oho!’ and groans.]</p>
<p>Wolf. ‘That’s the holy light of the Christian Socialists!’</p>
<p>Mr. Kletzenbauer (Christian Socialist). ‘Dam–nation! Are you ever
going to quiet down?’</p>
<p>Wolf discharges a galling remark at Mr. Wohlmeyer.</p>
<p>Wohlmeyer (responding). ‘You Jew, you!’</p>
<p>There is a moment’s lull, and Dr. Lueger begins his speech. Graceful,
handsome man, with winning manners and attractive bearing, a bright and
easy speaker, and is said to know how to trim his political sails to
catch any favouring wind that blows. He manages to say a few words, then
the tempest overwhelms him again.</p>
<p>Wolf stops reading his paper a moment to say a drastic thing about
Lueger and his Christian-Social pieties, which sets the C.S.S. in a sort
of frenzy.</p>
<p>Mr. Vielohlawek. ‘You leave the Christian Socialists alone, you
word-of-honour-breaker! Obstruct all you want to, but you leave them
alone! You’ve no business in this House; you belong in a gin-mill!’</p>
<p>Mr. Prochazka. ‘In a lunatic-asylum, you mean!’</p>
<p>Vielohlawek. ‘It’s a pity that such man should be leader of the
Germans; he disgraces the German name!’</p>
<p>Dr. Scheicher. ‘It’s a shame that the like of him should insult
us.’</p>
<p>Strohbach (to Wolf). ‘Contemptible cub–we will bounce thee out of
this!’ [It is inferable that the ‘thee’ is not intended to indicate
affection this time, but to re-enforce and emphasise Mr. Storhbach’s
scorn.]</p>
<p>Dr. Scheicher. ‘His insults are of no consequence. He wants his ears
boxed.’</p>
<p>Dr. Lueger (to Wolf). ‘You’d better worry a trifle over your Iro’s
word of honour. You are behaving like a street arab.’</p>
<p>Dr. Scheicher. ‘It is infamous!’</p>
<p>Dr. Lueger. ‘And these shameless creatures are the leaders of the
German People’s Party!’</p>
<p>Meantime Wolf goes whooping along with his newspaper readings in
great contentment.</p>
<p>Dr. Pattai. ‘Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You haven’t the floor!’</p>
<p>Strohbach. ‘The miserable cub!’</p>
<p>Dr. Lueger (to Wolf, raising his voice strenuously above the storm).
‘You are a wholly honourless street brat!’ [A voice, ‘Fire the
rapscallion out!’ But Wolf’s soul goes marching noisily on, just the
same.]</p>
<p>Schonerer (vast and muscular, and endowed with the most powerful
voice in the Reichsrath; comes ploughing down through the standing
crowds, red, and choking with anger; halts before Deputy Wohlmeyer,
grabs a rule and smashes it with a blow upon a desk, threatens
Wohlmeyer’s face with his fist, and bellows out some personalities, and
a promise). ‘Only you wait–we’ll teach you!’ [A whirlwind of offensive
retorts assails him from the band of meek and humble Christian
Socialists compacted around their leader, that distinguished religious
expert, Dr. Lueger, Burgermeister of Vienna. Our breath comes in excited
gasps now, and we are full of hope. We imagine that we are back fifty
years ago in the Arkansas Legislature, and we think we know what is
going to happen, and are glad we came, and glad we are up in the
gallery, out of the way, where we can see the whole thing and yet not
have to supply any of the material for the inquest. However, as it turns
out, our confidence is abused, our hopes are misplaced.]</p>
<p>Dr. Pattai (wildly excited). ‘You quiet down, or we shall turn
ourselves loose! There will be cuffing of ears!’</p>
<p>Prochazka (in a fury). ‘No–not ear boxing, but genuine blows!’</p>
<p>Vieholawek. ‘I would rather take my hat off to a Jew than to
Wolf!’</p>
<p>Strohbach (to Wolf). ‘Jew flunky! Here we have been fighting the Jews
for ten years, and now you are helping them to power again. How much do
you get for it?’</p>
<p>Holansky. ‘What he wants is a strait-jacket!’</p>
<p>Wolf continues his reading. It is a market report now.</p>
<p>Remark flung across the House to Schonerer: ‘Die Grossmutter auf dem
Misthaufen erzeugt worden!’</p>
<p>It will be judicious not to translate that. Its flavour is pretty
high, in any case, but it becomes particularly gamy when you remember
that the first gallery was well stocked with ladies.</p>
<p>Apparently it was a great hit. It fetched thunders of joyous
enthusiasm out of the Christian Socialists, and in their rapture they
flung biting epithets with wasteful liberality at specially detested
members of the Opposition; among others, this one at Schonerer, ‘Bordell
in der Krugerstrasse!’ Then they added these words, which they whooped,
howled, and also even sand, in a deep-voiced chorus: ‘Schmul Leeb Kohn!
Schmul Leeb Kohn! Schmul Leeb Kohn!’ and made it splendidly audible
above the banging of desk-boards and the rest of the roaring cyclone of
fiendish noises. [A gallery witticism comes flitting by from mouth to
mouth around the great curve: ‘The swan-song of Austrian representative
government!’ You can note its progress by the applausive smiles and nods
it gets as it skims along.]</p>
<p>Kletzenbauer. ‘Holofernes, where is Judith?’ [Storm of laughter.]</p>
<p>Gregorig (the shirt-merchant). ‘This Wolf-Theatre is costing 6,000
florins!’</p>
<p>Wolf (with sweetness). ‘Notice him, gentlemen; it is Mr. Gregorig.’
[Laughter.]</p>
<p>Vieholawek (to Wolf). ‘You Judas!’</p>
<p>Schneider. ‘Brothel-knight!’</p>
<p>Chorus of Voices. ‘East-German offal tub!’</p>
<p>And so the war of epithets crashes along, with never-diminishing
energy, for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The ladies in the gallery were learning. That was well; for by-and-by
ladies will form a part of the membership of all the legislatures in the
world; as soon as they can prove competency they will be admitted. At
present, men only are competent to legislate; therefore they look down
upon women, and would feel degraded if they had to have them for
colleagues in their high calling.</p>
<p>Wolf is yelling another market report now.</p>
<p>Gessman. ‘Shut up, infamous louse-brat!’</p>
<p>During a momentary lull Dr. Lueger gets a hearing for three sentences
of his speech. The demand and require that the President shall suppress
the four noisiest members of the Opposition.</p>
<p>Wolf (with a that-settles-it toss of the head). ‘The shifty trickster
of Vienna has spoken!’</p>
<p>Iro belonged to Schonerer’s party. The word-of-honour incident has
given it a new name. Gregorig is a Christian Socialist, and hero of the
post-cards and the Wimberger soda-squirting incident. He stands vast and
conspicuous, and conceited and self-satisfied, and roosterish and
inconsequential, at Lueger’s elbow, and is proud and cocky to be in such
a great company. He looks very well indeed; really majestic, and aware
of it. He crows out his little empty remark, now and then, and looks as
pleased as if he had been delivered of the Ausgleich. Indeed, he does
look notably fine. He wears almost the only dress vest on the floor; it
exposes a continental spread of white shirt-front; his hands are posed
at ease in the lips of his trousers pockets; his head is tilted back
complacently; he is attitudinising; he is playing to the gallery.
However, they are all doing that. It is curious to see. Men who only
vote, and can’t make speeches, and don’t know how to invent witty
ejaculations, wander about the vacated parts of the floor, and stop in a
good place and strike attitudes–attitudes suggestive of weighty thought,
mostly–and glance furtively up at the galleries to see how it works; or
a couple will come together and shake hands in an artificial way, and
laugh a gay manufactured laugh, and do some constrained and
self-conscious attitudinising; and they steal glances at the galleries
to see if they are getting notice. It is like a scene on the
stage–by-play by minor actors at the back while the stars do the great
work at the front. Even Count Badeni attitudinises for a moment; strikes
a reflective Napoleonic attitude of fine picturesqueness–but soon thinks
better of it and desists. There are two who do not attitudinise–poor
harried and insulted President Abrahamowicz, who seems wholly miserable,
and can find no way to put in the dreary time but by swinging his bell
and discharging occasional remarks which nobody can hear; and a resigned
and patient priest, who sits lonely in a great vacancy on Majority
territory and munches an apple.</p>
<p>Schonerer uplifts his fog-horn of a voice and shakes the roof with an
insult discharged at the Majority.</p>
<p>Dr. Lueger. ‘The Honourless Party would better keep still here!’</p>
<p>Gregorig (the echo, swelling out his shirt-front). ‘Yes, keep quiet,
pimp!’</p>
<p>Schonerer (to Lueger). ‘Political mountebank!’</p>
<p>Prochazka (to Schonerer). ‘Drunken clown!’</p>
<p>During the final hour of the sitting many happy phrases were
distributed through the proceedings. Among them were these–and they are
strikingly good ones:</p>
<p>‘Blatherskite!’</p>
<p>‘Blackguard!’</p>
<p>‘Scoundrel!’</p>
<p>‘Brothel-daddy!’</p>
<p>This last was the contribution of Dr. Gessman, and gave great
satisfaction. And deservedly. It seems to me that it was one of the most
sparkling things that was said during the whole evening.</p>
<p>At half-past two in the morning the House adjourned. The victory was
with the Opposition. No; not quite that. The effective part of it was
snatched away from them by an unlawful exercise of Presidential force
–another contribution toward driving the mistreated Minority out of
their minds.</p>
<p>At other sittings of the parliament, gentlemen of the Opposition,
shaking their fists toward the President, addressed him as ‘Polish Dog’.
At one sitting an angry deputy turned upon a colleague and shouted,
‘———-!’</p>
<p>You must try to imagine what it was. If I should offer it even in the
original it would probably not get by the editor’s blue pencil; to offer
a translation would be to waste my ink, of course. This remark was
frankly printed in its entirety by one of the Vienna dailies, but the
others disguised the toughest half of it with stars.</p>
<p>If the reader will go back over this chapter and gather its array of
extraordinary epithets into a bunch and examine them, he will marvel at
two things: how this convention of gentlemen could consent to use such
gross terms; and why the users were allowed to get out the place alive.
There is no way to understand this strange situation. If every man in
the House were a professional blackguard, and had his home in a sailor
boarding-house, one could still not understand it; for, although that
sort do use such terms, they never take them. These men are not
professional blackguards; they are mainly gentlemen, and educated; yet
they use the terms, and take them too. They really seem to attach no
consequence to them. One cannot say that they act like schoolboys; for
that is only almost true, not entirely. Schoolboys blackguard each other
fiercely, and by the hour, and one would think that nothing would ever
come of it but noise; but that would be a mistake. Up to a certain limit
the result would be noise only, but, that limit overstepped, trouble
would follow right away. There are certain phrases–phrases of a peculiar
character–phrases of the nature of that reference to Schonerer’s
grandmother, for instance–which not even the most spiritless schoolboy
in the English-speaking world would allow to pass unavenged. One
difference between schoolboys and the law-makers of the Reichsrath seems
to be that the law-makers have no limit, no danger-line. Apparently they
may call each other what they please, and go home unmutilated.</p>
<p>Now, in fact, they did have a scuffle on two occasions, but it was
not on account of names called. There has been no scuffle where that was
the cause.</p>
<p>It is not to be inferred that the House lacks a sense of honour
because it lacks delicacy. That would be an error. Iro was caught in a
lie, and it profoundly disgraced him. The House cut him, turned its back
upon him. He resigned his seat; otherwise he would have been expelled.
But it was lenient with Gregorig, who had called Iro a cowardly
blatherskite in debate. It merely went through the form of mildly
censuring him. That did not trouble Gregorig.</p>
<p>The Viennese say of themselves that they are an easy-going,
pleasure-loving community, making the best of life, and not taking it
very seriously. Nevertheless, they are grieved about the ways of their
Parliament, and say quite frankly that they are ashamed. They claim that
the low condition of the parliament’s manners is new, not old. A
gentleman who was at the head of the government twenty years ago
confirms this, and says that in his time the parliament was orderly and
well-behaved. An English gentleman of long residence here endorses this,
and says that a low order of politicians originated the present forms of
questionable speech on the stump some years ago, and imported them into
the parliament.[2] However, some day there will be a Minister of
Etiquette and a sergeant-at-arms, and then things will go better. I mean
if parliament and the Constitution survive the present storm.</p>
<p>IV.–THE HISTORIC CLIMA</p>
<p>XDuring the whole of November things went from bad to worse. The
all-important Ausgleich remained hard aground, and could not be sparred
off. Badeni’s government could not withdraw the Language Ordinance and
keep its majority, and the Opposition could not be placated on easier
terms. One night, while the customary pandemonium was crashing and
thundering along at its best, a fight broke out. It was a surging,
struggling, shoulder-to-shoulder scramble. A great many blows were
struck. Twice Schonerer lifted one of the heavy ministerial fauteuils
–some say with one hand–and threatened members of the Majority with it,
but it was wrenched away from him; a member hammered Wolf over the head
with the President’s bell, and another member choked him; a professor
was flung down and belaboured with fists and choked; he held up an open
penknife as a defence against the blows; it was snatched from him and
flung to a distance; it hit a peaceful Christian Socialist who wasn’t
doing anything, and brought blood from his hand. This was the only blood
drawn. The men who got hammered and choked looked sound and well next
day. The fists and the bell were not properly handled, or better results
would have been apparent. I am quite sure that the fighters were not in
earnest.</p>
<p>On Thanksgiving Day the sitting was a history-making one. On that day
the harried, bedevilled, and despairing government went insane. In order
to free itself from the thraldom of the Opposition it committed this
curiously juvenile crime; it moved an important change of the Rules of
the House, forbade debate upon the motion, put it to a stand-up vote
instead of ayes and noes, and then gravely claimed that it had been
adopted; whereas, to even the dullest witness–if I without immodesty may
pretend to that place–it was plain that nothing legitimately to be
called a vote had been taken at all.</p>
<p>I think that Saltpeter never uttered a truer thing than when he said,
‘Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.’ Evidently the
government’s mind was tottering when this bald insults to the House was
the best way it could contrive for getting out of the frying-pan.</p>
<p>The episode would have been funny if the matter at stake had been a
trifle; but in the circumstances it was pathetic. The usual storm was
raging in the House. As usual, many of the Majority and the most of the
Minority were standing up–to have a better chance to exchange epithets
and make other noises. Into this storm Count Falkenhayn entered, with
his paper in his hand; and at once there was a rush to get near him and
hear him read his motion. In a moment he was walled in by listeners. The
several clauses of his motion were loudly applauded by these allies, and
as loudly disapplauded–if I may invent a word–by such of the Opposition
as could hear his voice. When he took his seat the President promptly
put the motion–persons desiring to vote in the affirmative, stand up!
The House was already standing up; had been standing for an hour; and
before a third of it had found out what the President had been saying,
he had proclaimed the adoption of the motion! And only a few heard that.
In fact, when that House is legislating you can’t tell it from artillery
practice.</p>
<p>You will realise what a happy idea it was to side-track the lawful
ayes and noes and substitute a stand-up vote by this fact: that a little
later, when a deputation of deputies waited upon the President and asked
him if he was actually willing to claim that that measure had been
passed, he answered, ‘Yes–and unanimously.’ It shows that in effect the
whole House was on its feet when that trick was sprung.</p>
<p>The ‘Lex Falkenhayn,’ thus strangely born, gave the President power
to suspend for three days any deputy who should continue to be
disorderly after being called to order twice, and it also placed at his
disposal such force as might be necessary to make the suspension
effective. So the House had a sergeant-at-arms at last, and a more
formidable one, as to power, than any other legislature in Christendom
had ever possessed. The Lex Falkenhayn also gave the House itself
authority to suspend members for thirty days.</p>
<p>On these terms the Ausgleich could be put through in an
hour–apparently. The Opposition would have to sit meek and quiet, and
stop obstructing, or be turned into the street, deputy after deputy,
leaving the Majority an unvexed field for its work.</p>
<p>Certainly the thing looked well. The government was out of the
frying-pan at last. It congratulated itself, and was almost girlishly
happy. Its stock rose suddenly from less than nothing to a premium. It
confessed to itself, with pride, that its Lex Falkenhayn was a
master-stroke–a work of genius.</p>
<p>However, there were doubters–men who were troubled, and believed that
a grave mistake had been made. It might be that the Opposition was
crushed, and profitably for the country, too; but the manner of it–the
manner of it! That was the serious part. It could have far-reaching
results; results whose gravity might transcend all guessing. It might be
the initial step toward a return to government by force, a restoration
of the irresponsible methods of obsolete times.</p>
<p>There were no vacant seats in the galleries next day. In fact,
standing-room outside the building was at a premium. There were crowds
there, and a glittering array of helmeted and brass-buttoned police, on
foot and on horseback, to keep them from getting too much excited. No
one could guess what was going to happen, but every one felt that
something was going to happen, and hoped he might have a chance to see
it, or at least get the news of it while it was fresh.</p>
<p>At noon the House was empty–for I do not count myself. Half an hour
later the two galleries were solidly packed, the floor still empty.
Another half-hour later Wolf entered and passed to his place; then other
deputies began to stream in, among them many forms and faces grown
familiar of late. By one o’clock the membership was present in full
force. A band of Socialists stood grouped against the ministerial desks,
in the shadow of the Presidential tribune. It was observable that these
official strongholds were now protected against rushes by bolted gates,
and that these were in ward of servants wearing the House’s livery. Also
the removable desk-boards had been taken away, and nothing left for
disorderly members to slat with.</p>
<p>There was a pervading, anxious hush–at least what stood very well for
a hush in that House. It was believed by many that the Opposition was
cowed, and that there would be no more obstruction, no more noise. That
was an error.</p>
<p>Presently the President entered by the distant door to the right,
followed by Vice-President Fuchs, and the two took their way down past
the Polish benches toward the tribune. Instantly the customary storm of
noises burst out, and rose higher and higher, and wilder and wilder, and
really seemed to surpass anything that had gone before it in that place.
The President took his seat and begged for order, but no one could hear
him. His lips moved–one could see that; he bowed his body forward
appealingly, and spread his great hand eloquently over his breast–one
could see that; but as concerned his uttered words, he probably could
not hear them himself. Below him was that crowd of two dozen Socialists
glaring up at him, shaking their fists at him, roaring imprecations and
insulting epithets at him. This went on for some time. Suddenly the
Socialists burst through the gates and stormed up through the
ministerial benches, and a man in a red cravat reached up and snatched
the documents that lay on the President’s desk and flung them abroad.
The next moment he and his allies were struggling and fighting with the
half-dozen uniformed servants who were there to protect the new gates.
Meantime a detail of Socialists had swarmed up the side steps and
overflowed the President and the Vice, and were crowding and shouldering
and shoving them out of the place. They crowded them out, and down the
steps and across the House, past the Polish benches; and all about them
swarmed hostile Poles and Czechs, who resisted them. One could see fists
go up and come down, with other signs and shows of a heady fight; then
the President and the Vice disappeared through the door of entrance, and
the victorious Socialists turned and marched back, mounted the tribune,
flung the President’s bell and his remaining papers abroad, and then
stood there in a compact little crowd, eleven strong, and held the place
as if it were a fortress. Their friends on the floor were in a frenzy of
triumph, and manifested it in their deafening way. The whole House was
on its feet, amazed and wondering.</p>
<p>It was an astonishing situation, and imposingly dramatic. Nobody had
looked for this. The unexpected had happened. What next? But there can
be no next; the play is over; the grand climax is reached; the
possibilities are exhausted; ring down the curtain.</p>
<p>Not yet. That distant door opens again. And now we see what history
will be talking of five centuries hence: a uniformed and helmeted
battalion of bronzed and stalwart men marching in double file down the
floor of the House–a free parliament profaned by an invasion of brute
force!</p>
<p>It was an odious spectacle–odious and awful. For one moment it was an
unbelievable thing–a thing beyond all credibility; it must be a
delusion, a dream, a nightmare. But no, it was real–pitifully real,
shamefully real, hideously real. These sixty policemen had been
soldiers, and they went at their work with the cold unsentimentality of
their trade. They ascended the steps of the tribune, laid their hands
upon the inviolable persons of the representatives of a nation, and
dragged and tugged and hauled them down the steps and out at the door;
then ranged themselves in stately military array in front of the
ministerial estrade, and so stood.</p>
<p>It was a tremendous episode. The memory of it will outlast all the
thrones that exist to-day. In the whole history of free parliaments the
like of it had been seen but three times before. It takes its imposing
place among the world’s unforgettable things. It think that in my
lifetime I have not twice seen abiding history made before my eyes, but
I know that I have seen it once.</p>
<p>Some of the results of this wild freak followed instantly. The Badeni
government came down with a crash; there was a popular outbreak or two
in Vienna; there were three or four days of furious rioting in Prague,
followed by the establishing there of martial law; the Jews and Germans
were harried and plundered, and their houses destroyed; in other
Bohemian towns there was rioting–in some cases the Germans being the
rioters, in others the Czechs–and in all cases the Jew had to roast, no
matter which side he was on. We are well along in December now;[3] the
next new Minister-President has not been able to patch up a peace among
the warring factions of the parliament, therefore there is no use in
calling it together again for the present; public opinion believes that
parliamentary government and the Constitution are actually threatened
with extinction, and that the permanency of the monarchy itself is a not
absolutely certain thing!</p>
<p>Yes, the Lex Falkenhayn was a great invention, and did what was
claimed for it–it got the government out of the frying-pan.</p>
<p>[1] That is, revolution.</p>
<p>[2] ‘In that gracious bygone time when a mild and good-tempered
spirit was the atmosphere of our House, when the manner of our speakers
was studiously formal and academic, and the storms and explosions of
to-day were wholly unknown,’ etc.–Translation of the opening remark of a
leading article in this morning’s ‘Neue Freie Presse,’ December 11.</p>
<p>[3] It is the 9th.–M.T.</p>
<p>PRIVATE HISTORY OF THE ‘JUMPING FROG’ STORY</p>
<p>Five or six years ago a lady from Finland asked me to tell her a
story in our Negro dialect, so that she could get an idea of what that
variety of speech was like. I told her one of Hopkinson Smith’s Negro
stories, and gave her a copy of ‘Harper’s Monthly’ containing it. She
translated it for a Swedish newspaper, but by an oversight named me as
the author of it instead of Smith. I was very sorry for that, because I
got a good lashing in the Swedish press, which would have fallen to his
share but for that mistake; for it was shown that Boccaccio had told
that very story, in his curt and meagre fashion, five hundred years
before Smith took hold of it and made a good and tellable thing out of
it.</p>
<p>I have always been sorry for Smith. But my own turn has come now. A
few weeks ago Professor Van Dyke, of Princeton, asked this question:</p>
<p>‘Do you know how old your “Jumping Frog“ story is?’</p>
<p>And I answered:</p>
<p>‘Yes–forty-five years. The thing happened in Calaveras County, in the
spring of 1849.’</p>
<p>‘No; it happened earlier–a couple of thousand years earlier; it is a
Greek story.’</p>
<p>I was astonished–and hurt. I said:</p>
<p>‘I am willing to be a literary thief if it has been so ordained; I am
even willing to be caught robbing the ancient dead alongside of
Hopkinson Smith, for he is my friend and a good fellow, and I think
would be as honest as any one if he could do it without occasioning
remark; but I am not willing to antedate his crimes by fifteen hundred
years. I must ask you to knock off part of that.’</p>
<p>But the professor was not chaffing: he was in earnest, and could not
abate a century. He offered to get the book and send it to me and the
Cambridge text-book containing the English translation also. I thought I
would like the translation best, because Greek makes me tired. January
30th he sent me the English version, and I will presently insert it in
this article. It is my ‘Jumping Frog’ tale in every essential. It is not
strung out as I have strung it out, but it is all there.</p>
<p>To me this is very curious and interesting. Curious for several
reasons. For instance:</p>
<p>I heard the story told by a man who was not telling it to his hearers
as a thing new to them, but as a thing which they had witnessed and
would remember. He was a dull person, and ignorant; he had no gift as a
story-teller, and no invention; in his mouth this episode was merely
history–history and statistics; and the gravest sort of history, too; he
was entirely serious, for he was dealing with what to him were austere
facts, and they interested him solely because they were facts; he was
drawing on his memory, not his mind; he saw no humour in his tale,
neither did his listeners; neither he nor they ever smiled or laughed;
in my time I have not attended a more solemn conference. To him and to
his fellow gold-miners there were just two things in the story that were
worth considering. One was the smartness of its hero, Jim Smiley, in
taking the stranger in with a loaded frog; and the other was Smiley’s
deep knowledge of a frog’s nature–for he knew (as the narrator asserted
and the listeners conceded) that a frog likes shot and is already ready
to eat it. Those men discussed those two points, and those only. They
were hearty in their admiration of them, and none of the party was aware
that a first-rate story had been told in a first-rate way, and that it
brimful of a quality whose presence they never suspected–humour.</p>
<p>Now, then, the interesting question is, did the frog episode happen
in Angel’s Camp in the spring of ’49, as told in my hearing that day in
the fall of 1865? I am perfectly sure that it did. I am also sure that
its duplicate happened in Boeotia a couple of thousand years ago. I
think it must be a case of history actually repeating itself, and not a
case of a good story floating down the ages and surviving because too
good to be allowed to perish.</p>
<p>I would now like to have the reader examine the Greek story and the
story told by the dull and solemn Californian, and observe how exactly
alike they are in essentials.</p>
<p>[Translation.]</p>
<p>THE ATHENIAN AND THE FROG.[1]</p>
<p>An Athenian once fell in with a Boeotian who was sitting by the
road-side looking at a frog. Seeing the other approach, the Boeotian
said his was a remarkable frog, and asked if he would agree to start a
contest of frogs, on condition that he whose frog jumped farthest should
receive a large sum of money. The Athenian replied that he would if the
other would fetch him a frog, for the lake was near. To this he agreed,
and when he was gone the Athenian took the frog, and, opening its mouth,
poured some stones into its stomach, so that it did not indeed seem
larger than before, but could not jump. The Boeotian soon returned with
the other frog, and the contest began. The second frog first was
pinched, and jumped moderately; then they pinched the Boeotian frog. And
he gathered himself for a leap, and used the utmost effort, but he could
not move his body the least. So the Athenian departed with the money.
When he was gone the Boeotian, wondering what was the matter with the
frog, lifted him up and examined him. And being turned upside down, he
opened his mouth and vomited out the stones.</p>
<p>And here is the way it happened in California:</p>
<p>FROM ‘THE CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG OF CALAVERAS COUNTY’</p>
<p>Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers and chicken cocks, and
tom-cats, and all of them kind of things, till you couldn’t rest, and
you couldn’t fetch nothing for him to bet on but he’d match you. He
ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal’lated to
educate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in
his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn
him, too. He’d give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you’d
see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut–see him turn one
summerset, or maybe a couple if he got a good start, and come down
flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of
ketching flies, and kep’him in practice so constant, that he’d nail a
fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted
was education, and he could do ‘most anything–and I believe him. Why,
I’ve seen him set Dan’l Webster down here on this flor–Dan’l Webster was
the name of the frog–and sing out, ’Flies, Dan’l, flies!’ and quicker’n
you could wink he’d spring straight up and snake a fly off’n the counter
there, and flop down on the floor ag’in as solid as a gob of mud, and
fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as
indifferent as if he hadn’t no idea he’d been doin’ any more’n any frog
might do. You never see a frog so modest and straightfor’ard as he was,
for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on
a dead level, he could get over more ground at one straddle than any
animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong
suit, you understand; and when it came to that, Smiley would ante up
money on him as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his
frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had travelled and been
everywheres all said he laid over any frog that ever they see.</p>
<p>Well, Smiley kep’ the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to
fetch him down-town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller–a
stranger in the camp, he was–come acrost him with his box, and says:</p>
<p>‘What might it be that you’ve got in the box?’</p>
<p>And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, ‘It might be a parrot, or
it might be a canary, maybe, but it’s ain’t–it’s only just a frog.’</p>
<p>And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round
this way and that, and says, ‘H’m–so ’tis. Well, what’s he good
for?’</p>
<p>‘Well,’ Smiley says, easy and careless, ‘he’s good enough for one
thing, I should judge–he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.’</p>
<p>The feller took the box again and took another long, particular look,
and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, ‘Well,’ he says,
‘I don’t see no p’ints about that frog that’s any better’n any other
frog.’</p>
<p>‘Maybe you don’t,’ Smiley says. ‘Maybe you understand frogs and maybe
you don’t understand ’em; maybe you’ve had experience, and maybe you
ain’t only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I’ve got my opinion, and I’ll
resk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras
County.’</p>
<p>And the feller studies a minute, and then says, kinder sad like,
‘Well, I’m only a stranger here, and I ain’t got no frog, but if I had a
frog I’d bet you.’</p>
<p>And then Smiley says: ‘That’s all right–that’s all right; if you’ll
hold my box a minute, I’ll go and get you a frog.’ And so the feller
took the box and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley’s and set
down to wait.</p>
<p>So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself, and
then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon
and filled him full of quail shot–filled him pretty near up to his
chin–and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped
around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog and
fetched him in and give him to this feller, and says:</p>
<p>‘Now, if you’re ready, set him alongside of Dan’l, with his fore-paws
just even with Dan’l’s, and I’ll give the word.’ Then he says, ‘One
–two–three–git!’ and him and the feller touched up the frogs from
behind, and the new frog hopped off lively; but Dan’l give a heave, and
hysted up his shoulders–so–like a Frenchman, but it warn’t no use–he
couldn’t budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn’t no
more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised,
and he was disgusted, too, but he didn’t have no idea what the matter
was, of course.</p>
<p>The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out
at the door he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder–so–at Dan’l,
and says again, very deliberate: ‘Well,’ he says, ‘I don’t see no p’ints
about that frog that’s any better’n any other frog.’</p>
<p>Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan’l a long
time, and at last he says, ‘I do wonder what in the nation that frog
throw’d off for–I wonder if there ain’t something the matter with him
–he ’pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.’ And he ketched Dan’l by the
nape of the neck, and hefted him, and says, ‘Why, blame my cats if he
don’t weigh five pound!’ and turned him upside down, and he belched out
a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the
maddest man–he set the frog down and took out after that feeler, but he
never ketched him.</p>
<p>The resemblances are deliciously exact. There you have the wily
Boeotain and the wily Jim Smiley waiting–two thousand years apart–and
waiting, each equipped with his frog and ‘laying’ for the stranger. A
contest is proposed–for money. The Athenian would take a chance ‘if the
other would fetch him a frog’; the Yankee says: ‘I’m only a stranger
here, and I ain’t got a frog; but if I had a frog I’d bet you.’ The wily
Boeotian and the wily Californian, with that vast gulf of two thousand
years between, retire eagerly and go frogging in the marsh; the Athenian
and the Yankee remain behind and work a best advantage, the one with
pebbles, the other with shot. Presently the contest began. In the one
case ‘they pinched the Boeotian frog’; in the other, ‘him and the feller
touched up the frogs from behind.’ The Boeotian frog ‘gathered himself
for a leap’ (you can just see him!), but ‘could not move his body in the
least’; the Californian frog ‘give a heave, but it warn’t no use–he
couldn’t budge.’ In both the ancient and the modern cases the strangers
departed with the money. The Boeotian and the Californian wonder what is
the matter with their frogs; they lift them and examine; they turn them
upside down and out spills the informing ballast.</p>
<p>Yes, the resemblances are curiously exact. I used to tell the story
of the ‘Jumping Frog’ in San Francisco, and presently Artemus Ward came
along and wanted it to help fill out a little book which he was about to
publish; so I wrote it out and sent it to his publisher, Carleton; but
Carleton thought the book had enough matter in it, so he gave the story
to Henry Clapp as a present, and Clapp put it in his ‘Saturday Press,’
and it killed that paper with a suddenness that was beyond praise. At
least the paper died with that issue, and none but envious people have
ever tried to rob me of the honour and credit of killing it. The
‘Jumping Frog’ was the first piece of writing of mine that spread itself
through the newspapers and brought me into public notice. Consequently,
the ‘Saturday Press’ was a cocoon and I the worm in it; also, I was the
gay-coloured literary moth which its death set free. This simile has
been used before.</p>
<p>Early in ‘66 the ’Jumping Frog’ was issued in book form, with other
sketches of mine. A year or two later Madame Blanc translated it into
French and published it in the ‘Revue des Deux Mondes,’ but the result
was not what should have been expected, for the ‘Revue’ struggled along
and pulled through, and is alive yet. I think the fault must have been
in the translation. I ought to have translated it myself. I think so
because I examined into the matter and finally retranslated the sketch
from the French back into English, to see what the trouble was; that is,
to see just what sort of a focus the French people got upon it. Then the
mystery was explained. In French the story is too confused and chaotic
and unreposeful and ungrammatical and insane; consequently it could only
cause grief and sickness–it could not kill. A glance at my retranslation
will show the reader that this must be true.</p>
<p>[My Retranslation.]</p>
<p>THE FROG JUMPING OF THE COUNTY OF CALAVERAS</p>
<p>Eh bien! this Smiley nourished some terriers a rats, and some cocks
of combat, and some cats, and all sorts of things: and with his rage of
betting one no had more of repose. He trapped one day a frog and him
imported with him (et l’emporta chez lui) saying that he pretended to
make his education. You me believe if you will, but during three months
he not has nothing done but to him apprehend to jump (apprendre a
sauter) in a court retired of her mansion (de sa maison). And I you
respond that he have succeeded. He him gives a small blow by behind, and
the instant after you shall see the frog turn in the air like a
grease-biscuit, make one summersault, sometimes two, when she was well
started, and refall upon his feet like a cat. He him had accomplished in
the art of to gobble the flies (gober des mouches), and him there
exercised continually–so well that a fly at the most far that she
appeared was a fly lost. Smiley had custom to say that all which lacked
to a frog it was the education, but with the education she could do
nearly all–and I him believe. Tenez, I him have seen pose Daniel Webster
there upon this plank–Daniel Webster was the name of the frog–and to him
sing, ‘Some flies, Daniel, some flies!’–in a fash of the eye Daniel had
bounded and seized a fly here upon the counter, then jumped anew at the
earth, where he rested truly to himself scratch the head with his
behind-foot, as if he no had not the least idea of his superiority.
Never you not have seen frog as modest, as natural, sweet as she was.
And when he himself agitated to jump purely and simply upon plain earth,
she does more ground in one jump than any beast of his species than you
can know.</p>
<p>To jump plain–this was his strong. When he himself agitated for that
Smiley multiplied the bests upon her as long as there to him remained a
red. It must to know, Smiley was monstrously proud of his frog, and he
of it was right, for some men who were travelled, who had all seen, said
that they to him would be injurious to him compare to another frog.
Smiley guarded Daniel in a little box latticed which he carried bytimes
to the village for some bet.</p>
<p>One day an individual stranger at the camp him arrested with his box
and him said:</p>
<p>‘What is this that you have then shut up there within?’</p>
<p>Smiley said, with an air indifferent:</p>
<p>‘That could be a paroquet, or a syringe (ou un serin), but this no is
nothing of such, it not is but a frog.’</p>
<p>The individual it took, it regarded with care, it turned from one
side and from the other, then he said:</p>
<p>‘Tiens! in effect!–At what is she good?’</p>
<p>‘My God!’ responded Smiley, always with an air disengaged, ‘she is
good for one thing, to my notice (a mon avis), she can better in jumping
(elle peut batter en sautant) all frogs of the county of Calaveras.’</p>
<p>The individual retook the box, it examined of new longly, and it
rendered to Smiley in saying with an air deliberate:</p>
<p>‘Eh bien! I no saw not that that frog had nothing of better than each
frog.’ (Je ne vois pas que cette grenouille ait rien de mieux qu’aucune
grenouille.) [If that isn’t grammar gone to seed, then I count myself no
judge.–M.T.]</p>
<p>‘Possible that you not it saw not,’ said Smiley; ‘possible that
you–you comprehend frogs; possible that you not you there comprehend
nothing; possible that you had of the experience, and possible that you
not be but an amateur. Of all manner (de toute maniere) I bet forty
dollars that she batter in jumping no matter which frog of the country
of Calaveras.’</p>
<p>The individual reflected a second, and said like sad:</p>
<p>‘I not am but a stranger here, I no have not a frog; but if I of it
had one, I would embrace the bet.’</p>
<p>‘Strong, well!’ respond Smiley; ‘nothing of more facility. If you
will hold my box a minute, I go you to search a frog (j’irai vous
chercher.)’</p>
<p>Behold, then, the individual who guards the box, who puts his forty
dollars upon those of Smiley, and who attends (et qui attendre). He
attended enough longtimes, reflecting all solely. And figure you that he
takes Daniel, him opens the mouth by force and with a teaspoon him fills
with shot of the hunt, even him fills just to the chin, then he him puts
by the earth. Smiley during these times was at slopping in a swamp.
Finally he trapped (attrape) a frog, him carried to that individual, and
said:</p>
<p>‘Now if you be ready, put him all against Daniel, with their
before-feet upon the same line, and I give the signal’–then he added:
‘One, two three–advance!’</p>
<p>Him and the individual touched their frogs by behind, and the frog
new put to jump smartly, but Daniel himself lifted ponderously, exhalted
the shoulders thus, like a Frenchman–to what good? He could not budge,
he is planted solid like a church, he not advance no more than if one
him had put at the anchor.</p>
<p>Smiley was surprised and disgusted, but he not himself doubted not of
the turn being intended (mais il ne se doutait pas du tour bien
entendre). The indidivual empocketed the silver, himself with it went,
and of it himself in going is that he no gives not a jerk of thumb over
the shoulder–like that–at the poor Daniel, in saying with his air
deliberate–(L’individu empoche l’argent, s’en va et en s’en allant
est-ce qu’il ne donne pas un coup de pouce pas-dessus l’epaule, comme
ca, au pauvre Daniel, en disant de son air delibere).</p>
<p>‘Eh bien! I no see not that that frog has nothing of better than
another.’</p>
<p>Smiley himself scratched longtimes the head, the eyes fixed upon
Daniel, until that which at last he said:</p>
<p>‘I me demand how the devil it makes itself that this beast has
refused. Is it that she had something? One would believe that she is
stuffed.’</p>
<p>He grasped Daniel by the skin of the neck, him lifted and said:</p>
<p>‘The wolf me bite if he no weigh not five pounds.’</p>
<p>He him reversed and the unhappy belched two handfuls of shot (et le
malheureux, etc.). When Smiley recognised how it was, he was like mad.
He deposited his frog by the earth and ran after that individual, but he
not him caught never.</p>
<p>It may be that there are people who can translate better than I can,
but I am not acquainted with them.</p>
<p>So ends the private and public history of the Jumping Frog of
Calaveras County, an incident which has this unique feature about
it–that it is both old and new, a ‘chestnut’ and not a ‘chestnut;’ for
it was original when it happened two thousand years ago, and was again
original when it happened in California in our own time.</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>London, July, 1900.–Twice, recently, I have been asked this
question:</p>
<p>‘Have you seen the Greek version of the “Jumping Frog“?’</p>
<p>And twice I have answered–‘No.’</p>
<p>‘Has Professor Van Dyke seen it?’</p>
<p>‘I suppose so.’</p>
<p>‘Then you supposition is at fault.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>‘Because there isn’t any such version.’</p>
<p>‘Do you mean to intimate that the tale is modern, and not borrowed
from some ancient Greek book.’</p>
<p>‘Yes. It is not permissible for any but the very young and innocent
to be so easily beguiled as you and Van Dyke have been.’</p>
<p>‘Do you mean that we have fallen a prey to our ignorance and
simplicity?’</p>
<p>‘Yes. Is Van Dyke a Greek scholar?’</p>
<p>‘I believe so.’</p>
<p>‘Then he knew where to find the ancient Greek version if one existed.
Why didn’t he look? Why did he jump to conclusions?’</p>
<p>‘I don’t know. And was it worth the trouble, anyway?’</p>
<p>As it turns out, now, it was not claimed that the story had been
translated from the Greek. It had its place among other uncredited
stories, and was there to be turned into Greek by students of that
language. ‘Greek Prose Composition’–that title is what made the
confusion. It seemed to mean that the originals were Greek. It was not
well chosen, for it was pretty sure to mislead.</p>
<p>Thus vanishes the Greek Frog, and I am sorry: for he loomed fine and
grand across the sweep of the ages, and I took a great pride in him.</p>

<p>MY MILITARY CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>You have heard from a great many people who did something in the war;
is it not fair and right that you listen a little moment to one who
started out to do something in it, but didn’t? Thousands entered the
war, got just a taste of it, and then stepped out again, permanently.
These, by their very numbers, are respectable, and are therefore
entitled to a sort of voice–not a loud one, but a modest one; not a
boastful one, but an apologetic one. They ought not to be allowed much
space among better people–people who did something–I grant that; but
they ought at least to be allowed to state why they didn’t do anything,
and also to explain the process by which they didn’t do anything. Surely
this kind of light must have a sort of value.</p>
<p>Out West there was a good deal of confusion in men’s minds during the
first months of the great trouble–a good deal of unsettledness, of
leaning first this way, then that, then the other way. It was hard for
us to get our bearings. I call to mind an instance of this. I was
piloting on the Mississippi when the news came that South Carolina had
gone out of the Union on December 20, 1860. My pilot-mate was a New
Yorker. He was strong for the Union; so was I. But he would not listen
to me with any patience; my loyalty was smirched, to his eye, because my
father had owned slaves. I said, in palliation of this dark fact, that I
had heard my father say, some years before he died, that slavery was a
great wrong, and that he would free the solitary Negro he then owned if
he could think it right to give away the property of the family when he
was so straitened in means. My mate retorted that a mere impulse was
nothing–anybody could pretend to a good impulse; and went on decrying my
Unionism and libelling my ancestry. A month later the secession
atmosphere had considerably thickened on the Lower Mississippi, and I
became a rebel; so did he. We were together in New Orleans, January 26,
when Louisiana went out of the Union. He did his full share of the rebel
shouting, but was bitterly opposed to letting me do mine. He said that I
came of bad stock–of a father who had been willing to set slaves free.
In the following summer he was piloting a Federal gun-boat and shouting
for the Union again, and I was in the Confederate army. I held his note
for some borrowed money. He was one of the most upright men I ever knew;
but he repudiated that note without hesitation, because I was a rebel,
and the son of a man who had owned slaves.</p>
<p>In that summer–of 1861–the first wash of the wave of war broke upon
the shores of Missouri. Our State was invaded by the Union forces. They
took possession of St. Louis, Jefferson Barracks, and some other points.
The Governor, Claib Jackson, issued his proclamation calling out fifty
thousand militia to repel the invader.</p>
<p>I was visiting in the small town where my boyhood had been spent
–Hannibal, Marion County. Several of us got together in a secret place
by night and formed ourselves into a military company. One Tom Lyman, a
young fellow of a good deal of spirit but of no military experience, was
made captain; I was made second lieutenant. We had no first lieutenant;
I do not know why; it was long ago. There were fifteen of us. By the
advice of an innocent connected with the organisation, we called
ourselves the Marion Rangers. I do not remember that any one found fault
with the name. I did not; I thought it sounded quite well. The young
fellow who proposed this title was perhaps a fair sample of the kind of
stuff we were made of. He was young, ignorant, good-natured,
well-meaning, trivial, full of romance, and given to reading chivalric
novels and singing forlorn love-ditties. He had some pathetic little
nickel-plated aristocratic instincts, and detested his name, which was
Dunlap; detested it, partly because it was nearly as common in that
region as Smith, but mainly because it had a plebeian sound to his ear.
So he tried to ennoble it by writing it in this way: d’Unlap. That
contented his eye, but left his ear unsatisfied, for people gave the new
name the same old pronunciation–emphasis on the front end of it. He then
did the bravest thing that can be imagined–a thing to make one shiver
when one remembers how the world is given to resenting shams and
affectations; he began to write his name so: d’Un Lap. And he waited
patiently through the long storm of mud that was flung at this work of
art, and he had his reward at last; for he lived to see that name
accepted, and the emphasis put where he wanted it, by people who had
known him all his life, and to whom the tribe of Dunlaps had been as
familiar as the rain and the sunshine for forty years. So sure of
victory at last is the courage that can wait. He said he had found, by
consulting some ancient French chronicles, that the name was rightly and
originally written d’Un Lap; and said that if it were translated into
English it would mean Peterson: Lap, Latin or Greek, he said, for stone
or rock, same as the French Pierre, that is to say, Peter; d’, of or
from; un, a or one; hence d’Un Lap, of or from a stone or a Peter; that
is to say, one who is the son of a stone, the son of a Peter–Peterson.
Our militia company were not learned, and the explanation confused them;
so they called him Peterson Dunlap. He proved useful to us in his way;
he named our camps for us, and he generally struck a name that was ‘no
slouch,’ as the boys said.</p>
<p>That is one sample of us. Another was Ed Stevens, son of the town
jeweller,–trim-built, handsome, graceful, neat as a cat; bright,
educated, but given over entirely to fun. There was nothing serious in
life to him. As far as he was concerned, this military expedition of
ours was simply a holiday. I should say that about half of us looked
upon it in the same way; not consciously, perhaps, but unconsciously. We
did not think; we were not capable of it. As for myself, I was full of
unreasoning joy to be done with turning out of bed at midnight and four
in the morning, for a while; grateful to have a change, new scenes, new
occupations, a new interest. In my thoughts that was as far as I went; I
did not go into the details; as a rule one doesn’t at twenty-five.</p>
<p>Another sample was Smith, the blacksmith’s apprentice. This vast
donkey had some pluck, of a slow and sluggish nature, but a soft heart;
at one time he would knock a horse down for some impropriety, and at
another he would get homesick and cry. However, he had one ultimate
credit to his account which some of us hadn’t: he stuck to the war, and
was killed in battle at last.</p>
<p>Jo Bowers, another sample, was a huge, good-natured, flax-headed
lubber; lazy, sentimental, full of harmless brag, a grumbler by nature;
an experienced, industrious, ambitious, and often quite picturesque
liar, and yet not a successful one, for he had had no intelligent
training, but was allowed to come up just any way. This life was serious
enough to him, and seldom satisfactory. But he was a good fellow,
anyway, and the boys all liked him. He was made orderly sergeant;
Stevens was made corporal.</p>
<p>These samples will answer–and they are quite fair ones. Well, this
herd of cattle started for the war. What could you expect of them? They
did as well as they knew how, but really what was justly to be expected
of them? Nothing, I should say. That is what they did.</p>
<p>We waited for a dark night, for caution and secrecy were necessary;
then, toward midnight, we stole in couples and from various directions
to the Griffith place, beyond the town; from that point we set out
together on foot. Hannibal lies at the extreme south-eastern corner of
Marion County, on the Mississippi River; our objective point was the
hamlet of New London, ten miles away, in Ralls County.</p>
<p>The first hour was all fun, all idle nonsense and laughter. But that
could not be kept up. The steady trudging came to be like work; the play
had somehow oozed out of it; the stillness of the woods and the
sombreness of the night began to throw a depressing influence over the
spirits of the boys, and presently the talking died out and each person
shut himself up in his own thoughts. During the last half of the second
hour nobody said a word.</p>
<p>Now we approached a log farm-house where, according to report, there
was a guard of five Union soldiers. Lyman called a halt; and there, in
the deep gloom of the overhanging branches, he began to whisper a plan
of assault upon that house, which made the gloom more depressing than it
was before. It was a crucial moment; we realised, with a cold
suddenness, that here was no jest–we were standing face to face with
actual war. We were equal to the occasion. In our response there was no
hesitation, no indecision: we said that if Lyman wanted to meddle with
those soldiers, he could go ahead and do it; but if he waited for us to
follow him, he would wait a long time.</p>
<p>Lyman urged, pleaded, tried to shame us, but it had no effect. Our
course was plain, our minds were made up: we would flank the farmhouse
–go out around. And that is what we did. We turned the position.</p>
<p>We struck into the woods and entered upon a rough time, stumbling
over roots, getting tangled in vines, and torn by briers. At last we
reached an open place in a safe region, and sat down, blown and hot, to
cool off and nurse our scratches and bruises. Lyman was annoyed, but the
rest of us were cheerful; we had flanked the farm-house, we had made our
first military movement, and it was a success; we had nothing to fret
about, we were feeling just the other way. Horse-play and laughing began
again; the expedition was become a holiday frolic once more.</p>
<p>Then we had two more hours of dull trudging and ultimate silence and
depression; then, about dawn, we straggled into New London, soiled,
heel-blistered, fagged with our little march, and all of us except
Stevens in a sour and raspy humour and privately down on the war. We
stacked our shabby old shot-guns in Colonel Ralls’s barn, and then went
in a body and breakfasted with that veteran of the Mexican War.
Afterwards he took us to a distant meadow, and there in the shade of a
tree we listened to an old-fashioned speech from him, full of gunpowder
and glory, full of that adjective-piling, mixed metaphor, and windy
declamation which was regarded as eloquence in that ancient time and
that remote region; and then he swore us on the Bible to be faithful to
the State of Missouri and drive all invaders from her soil, no matter
whence they might come or under what flag they might march. This mixed
us considerably, and we could not make out just what service we were
embarked in; but Colonel Ralls, the practised politician and
phrase-juggler, was not similarly in doubt; he knew quite clearly that
he had invested us in the cause of the Southern Confederacy. He closed
the solemnities by belting around me the sword which his neighbour,
colonel Brown, had worn at Buena Vista and Molino del Rey; and he
accompanied this act with another impressive blast.</p>
<p>Then we formed in line of battle and marched four miles to a shady
and pleasant piece of woods on the border of the far-reached expanses of
a flowery prairie. It was an enchanting region for war–our kind of
war.</p>
<p>We pierced the forest about half a mile, and took up a strong
position, with some low, rocky, and wooded hills behind us, and a
purling, limpid creek in front. Straightway half the command were in
swimming, and the other half fishing. The ass with the French name gave
this position a romantic title, but it was too long, so the boys
shortened and simplified it to Camp Ralls.</p>
<p>We occupied an old maple-sugar camp, whose half-rotted troughs were
still propped against the trees. A long corn-crib served for sleeping
quarters for the battalion. On our left, half a mile away, was Mason’s
farm and house; and he was a friend to the cause. Shortly after noon the
farmers began to arrive from several directions, with mules and horses
for our use, and these they lent us for as long as the war might last,
which they judged would be about three months. The animals were of all
sizes, all colours, and all breeds. They were mainly young and frisky,
and nobody in the command could stay on them long at a time; for we were
town boys, and ignorant of horsemanship. The creature that fell to my
share was a very small mule, and yet so quick and active that it could
throw me without difficulty; and it did this whenever I got on it. Then
it would bray–stretching its neck out, laying its ears back, and
spreading its jaws till you could see down to its works. It was a
disagreeable animal, in every way. If I took it by the bridle and tried
to lead it off the grounds, it would sit down and brace back, and no one
could budge it. However, I was not entirely destitute of military
resources, and I did presently manage to spoil this game; for I had seen
many a steam-boat aground in my time, and knew a trick or two which even
a grounded mule would be obliged to respect. There was a well by the
corn-crib; so I substituted thirty fathom of rope for the bridle, and
fetched him home with the windlass.</p>
<p>I will anticipate here sufficiently to say that we did learn to ride,
after some days’ practice, but never well. We could not learn to like
our animals; they were not choice ones, and most of them had annoying
peculiarities of one kind or another. Stevens’s horse would carry him,
when he was not noticing, under the huge excrescences which form on the
trunks of oak-trees, and wipe him out of the saddle; in this way Stevens
got several bad hurts. Sergeant Bowers’s horse was very large and tall,
with slim, long legs, and looked like a railroad bridge. His size
enabled him to reach all about, and as far as he wanted to, with his
head; so he was always biting Bowers’s legs. On the march, in the sun,
Bowers slept a good deal; and as soon as the horse recognised that he
was asleep he would reach around and bite him on the leg. His legs were
black and blue with bites. This was the only thing that could ever make
him swear, but this always did; whenever the horse bit him he always
swore, and of course Stevens, who laughed at everything, laughed at
this, and would even get into such convulsions over it as to lose his
balance and fall off his horse; and then Bowers, already irritated by
the pain of the horse-bite, would resent the laughter with hard
language, and there would be a quarrel; so that horse made no end of
trouble and bad blood in the command.</p>
<p>However, I will get back to where I was–our first afternoon in the
sugar-camp. The sugar-troughs came very handy as horse-troughs, and we
had plenty of corn to fill them with. I ordered Sergeant Bowers to feed
my mule; but he said that if I reckoned he went to war to be dry-nurse
to a mule, it wouldn’t take me very long to find out my mistake. I
believed that this was insubordination, but I was full of uncertainties
about everything military, and so I let the thing pass, and went and
ordered Smith, the blacksmith’s apprentice, to feed the mule; but he
merely gave me a large, cold, sarcastic grin, such as an ostensibly
seven-year-old horse gives you when you lift his lip and find he is
fourteen, and turned his back on me. I then went to the captain, and
asked if it was not right and proper and military for me to have an
orderly. He said it was, but as there was only one orderly in the corps,
it was but right that he himself should have Bowers on his staff. Bowers
said he wouldn’t serve on anybody’s staff; and if anybody thought he
could make him, let him try it. So, of course, the thing had to be
dropped; there was no other way.</p>
<p>Next, nobody would cook; it was considered a degradation; so we had
no dinner. We lazied the rest of the pleasant afternoon away, some
dozing under the trees, some smoking cob-pipes and talking sweethearts
and war, some playing games. By late supper-time all hands were
famished; and to meet the difficulty all hands turned to, on an equal
footing, and gathered wood, built fires, and cooked the meal. Afterward
everything was smooth for a while; then trouble broke out between the
corporal and the sergeant, each claiming to rank the other. Nobody knew
which was the higher office; so Lyman had to settle the matter by making
the rank of both officers equal. The commander of an ignorant crew like
that has many troubles and vexations which probably do not occur in the
regular army at all. However, with the song-singing and yarn-spinning
around the camp-fire, everything presently became serene again; and
by-and-by we raked the corn down level in one end of the crib, and all
went to bed on it, tying a horse to the door, so that he would neigh if
any one tried to get in.[1]</p>
<p>We had some horsemanship drill every forenoon; then, afternoons, we
rode off here and there in squads a few miles, and visited the farmers’
girls, and had a youthful good time, and got an honest good dinner or
supper, and then home again to camp, happy and content.</p>
<p>For a time, life was idly delicious, it was perfect; there was
nothing to mar it. Then came some farmers with an alarm one day. They
said it was rumoured that the enemy were advancing in our direction,
from over Hyde’s prairie. The result was a sharp stir among us, and
general consternation. It was a rude awakening from our pleasant trance.
The rumour was but a rumour–nothing definite about it; so, in the
confusion, we did not know which way to retreat. Lyman was for not
retreating at all, in these uncertain circumstances; but he found that
if he tried to maintain that attitude he would fare badly, for the
command were in no humour to put up with insubordination. So he yielded
the point and called a council of war–to consist of himself and the
three other officers; but the privates made such a fuss about being left
out, that we had to allow them to remain, for they were already present,
and doing the most of the talking too. The question was, which way to
retreat; but all were so flurried that nobody seemed to have even a
guess to offer. Except Lyman. He explained in a few calm words, that
inasmuch as the enemy were approaching from over Hyde’s prairie, our
course was simple: all we had to do was not to retreat toward him; any
other direction would answer our needs perfectly. Everybody saw in a
moment how true this was, and how wise; so Lyman got a great many
compliments. It was now decided that we should fall back upon Mason’s
farm.</p>
<p>It was after dark by this time, and as we could not know how soon the
enemy might arrive, it did not seem best to try to take the horses and
things with us; so we only took the guns and ammunition, and started at
once. The route was very rough and hilly and rocky, and presently the
night grew very black and rain began to fall; so we had a troublesome
time of it, struggling and stumbling along in the dark; and soon some
person slipped and fell, and then the next person behind stumbled over
him and fell, and so did the rest, one after the other; and then Bowers
came with the keg of powder in his arms, whilst the command were all
mixed together, arms and legs, on the muddy slope; and so he fell, of
course, with the keg, and this started the whole detachment down the
hill in a body, and they landed in the brook at the bottom in a pile,
and each that was undermost pulling the hair and scratching and biting
those that were on top of him; and those that were being scratched and
bitten, scratching and biting the rest in their turn, and all saying
they would die before they would ever go to war again if they ever got
out of this brook this time, and the invader might rot for all they
cared, and the country along with them–and all such talk as that, which
was dismal to hear and take part in, in such smothered, low voices, and
such a grisly dark place and so wet, and the enemy maybe coming any
moment.</p>
<p>The keg of powder was lost, and the guns too; so the growling and
complaining continued straight along whilst the brigade pawed around the
pasty hillside and slopped around in the brook hunting for these things;
consequently we lost considerable time at this; and then we heard a
sound, and held our breath and listened, and it seemed to be the enemy
coming, though it could have been a cow, for it had a cough like a cow;
but we did not wait, but left a couple of guns behind and struck out for
Mason’s again as briskly as we could scramble along in the dark. But we
got lost presently among the rugged little ravines, and wasted a deal of
time finding the way again, so it was after nine when we reached Mason’s
stile at last; and then before we could open our mouths to give the
countersign, several dogs came bounding over the fence, with great riot
and noise, and each of them took a soldier by the slack of his trousers
and began to back away with him. We could not shoot the dogs without
endangering the persons they were attached to; so we had to look on,
helpless, at what was perhaps the most mortifying spectacle of the civil
war. There was light enough, and to spare, for the Masons had now run
out on the porch with candles in their hands. The old man and his son
came and undid the dogs without difficulty, all but Bowers’s; but they
couldn’t undo his dog, they didn’t know his combination; he was of the
bull kind, and seemed to be set with a Yale time-lock; but they got him
loose at last with some scalding water, of which Bowers got his share
and returned thanks. Peterson Dunlap afterwards made up a fine name for
this engagement, and also for the night march which preceded it, but
both have long ago faded out of my memory.</p>
<p>We now went into the house, and they began to ask us a world of
questions, whereby it presently came out that we did not know anything
concerning who or what we were running from; so the old gentleman made
himself very frank, and said we were a curious breed of soldiers, and
guessed we could be depended on to end up the war in time, because no
Government could stand the expense of the shoe-leather we should cost it
trying to follow us around. ‘Marion Rangers! good name, b’gosh!’ said
he. And wanted to know why we hadn’t had a picket-guard at the place
where the road entered the prairie, and why we hadn’t sent out a
scouting party to spy out the enemy and bring us an account of his
strength, and so on, before jumping up and stampeding out of a strong
position upon a mere vague rumour–and so on, and so forth, till he made
us all fell shabbier than the dogs had done, and not half so
enthusiastically welcome. So we went to bed shamed and low-spirited;
except Stevens. Soon Stevens began to devise a garment for Bowers which
could be made to automatically display his battle-scars to the grateful,
or conceal them from the envious, according to his occasions; but Bowers
was in no humour for this, so there was a fight, and when it was over
Stevens had some battle-scars of his own to think about.</p>
<p>Then we got a little sleep. But after all we had gone through, our
activities were not over for the night; for about two o’clock in the
morning we heard a shout of warning from down the lane, accompanied by a
chorus from all the dogs, and in a moment everybody was up and flying
around to find out what the alarm was about. The alarmist was a horseman
who gave notice that a detachment of Union soldiers was on its way from
Hannibal with orders to capture and hang any bands like ours which it
could find, and said we had no time to lose. Farmer Mason was in a
flurry this time, himself. He hurried us out of the house with all
haste, and sent one of his negroes with us to show us where to hide
ourselves and our tell-tale guns among the ravines half a mile away. It
was raining heavily.</p>
<p>We struck down the lane, then across some rocky pasture-land which
offered good advantages for stumbling; consequently we were down in the
mud most of the time, and every time a man went down he blackguarded the
war, and the people who started it, and everybody connected with it, and
gave himself the master dose of all for being so foolish as to go into
it. At last we reached the wooded mouth of a ravine, and there we
huddled ourselves under the streaming trees, and sent the negro back
home. It was a dismal and heart-breaking time. We were like to be
drowned with the rain, deafened with the howling wind and the booming
thunder, and blinded by the lightning. It was indeed a wild night. The
drenching we were getting was misery enough, but a deeper misery still
was the reflection that the halter might end us before we were a day
older. A death of this shameful sort had not occurred to us as being
among the possibilities of war. It took the romance all out of the
campaign, and turned our dreams of glory into a repulsive nightmare. As
for doubting that so barbarous an order had been given, not one of us
did that.</p>
<p>The long night wore itself out at last, and then the negro came to us
with the news that the alarm had manifestly been a false one, and that
breakfast would soon be ready. Straightway we were light-hearted again,
and the world was bright, and life as full of hope and promise as ever
–for we were young then. How long ago that was! Twenty-four years.</p>
<p>The mongrel child of philology named the night’s refuse Camp
Devastation, and no soul objected. The Masons gave us a Missouri country
breakfast, in Missourian abundance, and we needed it: hot biscuits; hot
‘wheat bread’ prettily criss-crossed in a lattice pattern on top; hot
corn pone; fried chicken; bacon, coffee, eggs, milk, buttermilk,
etc.;–and the world may be confidently challenged to furnish the equal
to such a breakfast, as it is cooked in the South.</p>
<p>We stayed several days at Mason’s; and after all these years the
memory of the dullness, the stillness and lifelessness of that
slumberous farm-house still oppresses my spirit as with a sense of the
presence of death and mourning. There was nothing to do, nothing to
think about; there was no interest in life. The male part of the
household were away in the fields all day, the women were busy and out
of our sight; there was no sound but the plaintive wailing of a
spinning-wheel, forever moaning out from some distant room–the most
lonesome sound in nature, a sound steeped and sodden with homesickness
and the emptiness of life. The family went to bed about dark every
night, and as we were not invited to intrude any new customs, we
naturally followed theirs. Those nights were a hundred years long to
youths accustomed to being up till twelve. We lay awake and miserable
till that hour every time, and grew old and decrepit waiting through the
still eternities for the clock-strikes. This was no place for town boys.
So at last it was with something very like joy that we received news
that the enemy were on our track again. With a new birth of the old
warrior spirit, we sprang to our places in line of battle and fell back
on Camp Ralls.</p>
<p>Captain Lyman had taken a hint from Mason’s talk, and he now gave
ordered that our camp should be guarded against surprise by the posting
of pickets. I was ordered to place a picket at the forks of the road in
Hyde’s prairie. Night shut down black and threatening. I told Sergeant
Bowers to go out to that place and stay till midnight; and, just as I
was expecting, he said he wouldn’t do it. I tried to get others to go,
but all refused. Some excused themselves on account of the weather; but
the rest were frank enough to say they wouldn’t go in any kind of
weather. This kind of thing sounds odd now, and impossible, but it
seemed a perfectly natural thing to do. There were scores of little
camps scattered over Missouri where the same thing was happening. These
camps were composed of young men who had been born and reared to a
sturdy independence, and who did not know what it meant to be ordered
around by Tom, Dick, and Harry, whom they had known familiarly all their
lives, in the village or on the farm. It is quite within the
probabilities that this same thing was happening all over the South.
James Redpath recognised the justice of this assumption, and furnished
the following instance in support of it. During a short stay in East
Tennessee he was in a citizen colonel’s tent one day, talking, when a
big private appeared at the door, and without salute or other
circumlocution said to the colonel:</p>
<p>‘Say, Jim, I’m a-goin’ home for a few days.’</p>
<p>‘What for?’</p>
<p>‘Well, I hain’t b’en there for a right smart while, and I’d like to
see how things is comin’ on.’</p>
<p>‘How long are you going to be gone?’</p>
<p>‘’Bout two weeks.’</p>
<p>‘Well don’t be gone longer than that; and get back sooner if you
can.’</p>
<p>That was all, and the citizen officer resumed his conversation where
the private had broken it off. This was in the first months of the war,
of course. The camps in our part of Missouri were under
Brigadier-General Thomas H. Harris. He was a townsman of ours, a
first-rate fellow, and well liked; but we had all familiarly known him
as the sole and modest-salaried operator in our telegraph office, where
he had to send about one dispatch a week in ordinary times, and two when
there was a rush of business; consequently, when he appeared in our
midst one day, on the wing, and delivered a military command of some
sort, in a large military fashion, nobody was surprised at the response
which he got from the assembled soldiery:</p>
<p>‘Oh, now, what’ll you take to don’t, Tom Harris!’</p>
<p>It was quite the natural thing. One might justly imagine that we were
hopeless material for war. And so we seemed, in our ignorant state; but
there were those among us who afterward learned the grim trade; learned
to obey like machines; became valuable soldiers; fought all through the
war, and came out at the end with excellent records. One of the very
boys who refused to go out on picket duty that night, and called me an
ass for thinking he would expose himself to danger in such a foolhardy
way, had become distinguished for intrepidity before he was a year
older.</p>
<p>I did secure my picket that night–not by authority, but by diplomacy.
I got Bowers to go, by agreeing to exchange ranks with him for the time
being, and go along and stand the watch with him as his subordinate. We
stayed out there a couple of dreary hours in the pitchy darkness and the
rain, with nothing to modify the dreariness but Bowers’s monotonous
growlings at the war and the weather; then we began to nod, and
presently found it next to impossible to stay in the saddle; so we gave
up the tedious job, and went back to the camp without waiting for the
relief guard. We rode into camp without interruption or objection from
anybody, and the enemy could have done the same, for there were no
sentries. Everybody was asleep; at midnight there was nobody to send out
another picket, so none was sent. We never tried to establish a watch at
night again, as far as I remember, but we generally kept a picket out in
the daytime.</p>
<p>In that camp the whole command slept on the corn in the big
corn-crib; and there was usually a general row before morning, for the
place was full of rats, and they would scramble over the boys’ bodies
and faces, annoying and irritating everybody; and now and then they
would bite some one’s toe, and the person who owned the toe would start
up and magnify his English and begin to throw corn in the dark. The ears
were half as heavy as bricks, and when they struck they hurt. The
persons struck would respond, and inside of five minutes every man would
be locked in a death-grip with his neighbour. There was a grievous deal
of blood shed in the corn-crib, but this was all that was spilt while I
was in the war. No, that is not quite true. But for one circumstance it
would have been all. I will come to that now.</p>
<p>Our scares were frequent. Every few days rumours would come that the
enemy were approaching. In these cases we always fell back on some other
camp of ours; we never stayed where we were. But the rumours always
turned out to be false; so at last even we began to grow indifferent to
them. One night a negro was sent to our corn-crib with the same old
warning: the enemy was hovering in our neighbourhood. We all said let
him hover. We resolved to stay still and be comfortable. It was a fine
warlike resolution, and no doubt we all felt the stir of it in our veins
–for a moment. We had been having a very jolly time, that was full of
horse-play and school-boy hilarity; but that cooled down now, and
presently the fast-waning fire of forced jokes and forced laughs died
out altogether, and the company became silent. Silent and nervous. And
soon uneasy–worried–apprehensive. We had said we would stay, and we were
committed. We could have been persuaded to go, but there was nobody
brave enough to suggest it. An almost noiseless movement presently began
in the dark, by a general and unvoiced impulse. When the movement was
completed, each man knew that he was not the only person who had crept
to the front wall and had his eye at a crack between the logs. No, we
were all there; all there with our hearts in our throats, and staring
out toward the sugar-troughs where the forest foot-path came through. It
was late, and there was a deep woodsy stillness everywhere. There was a
veiled moonlight, which was only just strong enough to enable us to mark
the general shape of objects. Presently a muffled sound caught our ears,
and we recognised it as the hoof-beats of a horse or horses. And right
away a figure appeared in the forest path; it could have been made of
smoke, its mass had so little sharpness of outline. It was a man on
horseback; and it seemed to me that there were others behind him. I got
hold of a gun in the dark, and pushed it through a crack between the
logs, hardly knowing what I was doing, I was so dazed with fright.
Somebody said ‘Fire!’ I pulled the trigger. I seemed to see a hundred
flashes and hear a hundred reports, then I saw the man fall down out of
the saddle. My first feeling was of surprised gratification; my first
impulse was an apprentice-sportsman’s impulse to run and pick up his
game. Somebody said, hardly audibly, ‘Good–we’ve got him!–wait for the
rest.’ But the rest did not come. There was not a sound, not the whisper
of a leaf; just perfect stillness; an uncanny kind of stillness, which
was all the more uncanny on account of the damp, earthy, late-night
smells now rising and pervading it. Then, wondering, we crept stealthily
out, and approached the man. When we got to him the moon revealed him
distinctly. He was lying on his back, with his arms abroad; his mouth
was open and his chest heaving with long gasps, and his white
shirt-front was all splashed with blood. The thought shot through me
that I was a murderer; that I had killed a man–a man who had never done
me any harm. That was the coldest sensation that ever went through my
marrow. I was down by him in a moment, helplessly stroking his forehead;
and I would have given anything then–my own life freely–to make him
again what he had been five minutes before. And all the boys seemed to
be feeling in the same way; they hung over him, full of pitying
interest, and tried all they could to help him, and said all sorts of
regretful things. They had forgotten all about the enemy; they thought
only of this one forlorn unit of the foe. Once my imagination persuaded
me that the dying man gave me a reproachful look out of his shadowy
eyes, and it seemed to me that I would rather he had stabbed me than
done that. He muttered and mumbled like a dreamer in his sleep, about
his wife and child; and I thought with a new despair, ‘This thing that I
have done does not end with him; it falls upon them too, and they never
did me any harm, any more than he.’</p>
<p>In a little while the man was dead. He was killed in war; killed in
fair and legitimate war; killed in battle, as you might say; and yet he
was as sincerely mourned by the opposing force as if he had been their
brother. The boys stood there a half hour sorrowing over him, and
recalling the details of the tragedy, and wondering who he might be, and
if he were a spy, and saying that if it were to do over again they would
not hurt him unless he attacked them first. It soon came out that mine
was not the only shot fired; there were five others–a division of the
guilt which was a grateful relief to me, since it in some degree
lightened and diminished the burden I was carrying. There were six shots
fired at once; but I was not in my right mind at the time, and my heated
imagination had magnified my one shot into a volley.</p>
<p>The man was not in uniform, and was not armed. He was a stranger in
the country; that was all we ever found out about him. The thought of
him got to preying upon me every night; I could not get rid of it. I
could not drive it away, the taking of that unoffending life seemed such
a wanton thing. And it seemed an epitome of war; that all war must be
just that–the killing of strangers against whom you feel no personal
animosity; strangers whom, in other circumstances, you would help if you
found them in trouble, and who would help you if you needed it. My
campaign was spoiled. It seemed to me that I was not rightly equipped
for this awful business; that war was intended for men, and I for a
child’s nurse. I resolved to retire from this avocation of sham
soldiership while I could save some remnant of my self-respect. These
morbid thoughts clung to me against reason; for at bottom I did not
believe I had touched that man. The law of probabilities decreed me
guiltless of his blood; for in all my small experience with guns I had
never hit anything I had tried to hit, and I knew I had done my best to
hit him. Yet there was no solace in the thought. Against a diseased
imagination, demonstration goes for nothing.</p>
<p>The rest of my war experience was of a piece with what I have already
told of it. We kept monotonously falling back upon one camp or another,
and eating up the country–I marvel now at the patience of the farmers
and their families. They ought to have shot us; on the contrary, they
were as hospitably kind and courteous to us as if we had deserved it. In
one of these camps we found Ab Grimes, an Upper Mississippi pilot, who
afterwards became famous as a dare-devil rebel spy, whose career
bristled with desperate adventures. The look and style of his comrades
suggested that they had not come into the war to play, and their deeds
made good the conjecture later. They were fine horsemen and good
revolver-shots; but their favourite arm was the lasso. Each had one at
his pommel, and could snatch a man out of the saddle with it every time,
on a full gallop, at any reasonable distance.</p>
<p>In another camp the chief was a fierce and profane old blacksmith of
sixty, and he had furnished his twenty recruits with gigantic home-made
bowie-knives, to be swung with the two hands, like the machetes of the
Isthmus. It was a grisly spectacle to see that earnest band practising
their murderous cuts and slashes under the eye of that remorseless old
fanatic.</p>
<p>The last camp which we fell back upon was in a hollow near the
village of Florida, where I was born–in Monroe County. Here we were
warned, one day, that a Union colonel was sweeping down on us with a
whole regiment at his heels. This looked decidedly serious. Our boys
went apart and consulted; then we went back and told the other companies
present that the war was a disappointment to us and we were going to
disband. They were getting ready, themselves, to fall back on some place
or other, and were only waiting for General Tom Harris, who was expected
to arrive at any moment; so they tried to persuade us to wait a little
while, but the majority of us said no, we were accustomed to falling
back, and didn’t need any of Tom Harris’s help; we could get along
perfectly well without him and save time too. So about half of our
fifteen, including myself, mounted and left on the instant; the others
yielded to persuasion and stayed–stayed through the war.</p>
<p>An hour later we met General Harris on the road, with two or three
people in his company–his staff, probably, but we could not tell; none
of them was in uniform; uniforms had not come into vogue among us yet.
Harris ordered us back; but we told him there was a Union colonel coming
with a whole regiment in his wake, and it looked as if there was going
to be a disturbance; so we had concluded to go home. He raged a little,
but it was of no use; our minds were made up. We had done our share; had
killed one man, exterminated one army, such as it was; let him go and
kill the rest, and that would end the war. I did not see that brisk
young general again until last year; then he was wearing white hair and
whiskers.</p>
<p>In time I came to know that Union colonel whose coming frightened me
out of the war and crippled the Southern cause to that extent–General
Grant. I came within a few hours of seeing him when he was as unknown as
I was myself; at a time when anybody could have said, ‘Grant?–Ulysses S.
Grant? I do not remember hearing the name before.’ It seems difficult to
realise that there was once a time when such a remark could be
rationally made; but there was, and I was within a few miles of the
place and the occasion too, though proceeding in the other
direction.</p>
<p>The thoughtful will not throw this war-paper of mine lightly aside as
being valueless. It has this value: it is a not unfair picture of what
went on in many and many a militia camp in the first months of the
rebellion, when the green recruits were without discipline, without the
steadying and heartening influence or trained leaders; when all their
circumstances were new and strange, and charged with exaggerated
terrors, and before the invaluable experience of actual collision in the
field had turned them from rabbits into soldiers. If this side of the
picture of that early day has not before been put into history, then
history has been to that degree incomplete, for it had and has its
rightful place there. There was more Bull Run material scattered through
the early camps of this country than exhibited itself at Bull Run. And
yet it learned its trade presently, and helped to fight the great
battles later. I could have become a soldier myself, if I had waited. I
had got part of it learned; I knew more about retreating than the man
that invented retreating.</p>
<p>[1] It was always my impression that that was what the horse was
there for, and I know that it was also the impression of at least one
other of the command, for we talked about it at the time, and admired
the military ingenuity of the device; but when I was out West three
years ago I was told by Mr. A. G. Fuqua, a member of our company, that
the horse was his, that the leaving him tied at the door was a matter of
mere forgetfulness, and that to attribute it to intelligent invention
was to give him quite too much credit. In support of his position, he
called my attention to the suggestive fact that the artifice was not
employed again. I had not thought of that before.</p>
