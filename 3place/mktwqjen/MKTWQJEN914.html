FROM HARTFORD, 1875. MUCH CORRESPONDENCE WITH HOWELLS</h4>
<p>Orion Clemens had kept his job with Bliss only a short time. His
mental make-up was such that it was difficult for him to hold any
position long. He meant to do well, but he was unfortunate in his
efforts. His ideas were seldom practical, his nature was yielding and
fickle. He had returned to Keokuk presently, and being convinced there
was a fortune in chickens, had prevailed upon his brother to purchase
for him a little farm not far from the town. But the chicken business
was not lively and Orion kept the mail hot with manuscripts and
propositions of every sort, which he wanted his brother to take under
advisement.</p>
<p>Certainly, to Mark Twain Orion Clemens was a trial. The letters of
the latter show that scarcely one of them but contains the outline of
some rainbow-chasing scheme, full of wild optimism, and the certainty
that somewhere just ahead lies the pot of gold. Only, now and then,
there is a letter of abject humiliation and complete surrender, when
some golden vision, some iridescent soap-bubble, had vanished at his
touch. Such depression did not last; by sunrise he was ready with a new
dream, new enthusiasm, and with a new letter inviting his “brother
Sam’s“ interest and investment. Yet, his fear of incurring his brother’s
displeasure was pitiful, regardless of the fact that he constantly
employed the very means to insure that result. At one time Clemens made
him sign a sworn agreement that he would not suggest any plan or scheme
of investment for the period of twelve months. Orion must have kept this
agreement. He would have gone to the stake before he would have violated
an oath, but the stake would have probably been no greater punishment
than his sufferings that year.</p>
<p>On the whole, Samuel Clemens was surprisingly patient and considerate
with Orion, and there was never a time that he was not willing to help.
Yet there were bound to be moments of exasperation; and once, when his
mother, or sister, had written, suggesting that he encourage his
brother’s efforts, he felt moved to write at considerable freedom.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and Mrs. Moffett, in Fredonia, N. Y.:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Sunday, 1875. MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,–I Saw Gov. Newell
today and he said he was still moving in the matter of Sammy’s
appointment–[As a West Point cadet.]–and would stick to it till he got a
result of a positive nature one way or the other, but thus far he did
not know whether to expect success or defeat.</p>
<p>Ma, whenever you need money I hope you won’t be backward about saying
so –you can always have it. We stint ourselves in some ways, but we have
no desire to stint you. And we don’t intend to, either.</p>
<p>I can’t “encourage“ Orion. Nobody can do that, conscientiously, for
the reason that before one’s letter has time to reach him he is off on
some new wild-goose chase. Would you encourage in literature a man who,
the older he grows the worse he writes? Would you encourage Orion in the
glaring insanity of studying law? If he were packed and crammed full of
law, it would be worthless lumber to him, for his is such a capricious
and ill-regulated mind that he would apply the principles of the law
with no more judgment than a child of ten years. I know what I am
saying. I laid one of the plainest and simplest of legal questions
before Orion once, and the helpless and hopeless mess he made of it was
absolutely astonishing. Nothing aggravates me so much as to have Orion
mention law or literature to me.</p>
<p>Well, I cannot encourage him to try the ministry, because he would
change his religion so fast that he would have to keep a traveling agent
under wages to go ahead of him to engage pulpits and board for him.</p>
<p>I cannot conscientiously encourage him to do anything but potter
around his little farm and put in his odd hours contriving new and
impossible projects at the rate of 365 a year–which is his customary
average. He says he did well in Hannibal! Now there is a man who ought
to be entirely satisfied with the grandeurs, emoluments and activities
of a hen farm–</p>
<p>If you ask me to pity Orion, I can do that. I can do it every day and
all day long. But one can’t “encourage“ quick-silver, because the
instant you put your finger on it it isn’t there. No, I am saying too
much–he does stick to his literary and legal aspirations; and he
naturally would select the very two things which he is wholly and
preposterously unfitted for. If I ever become able, I mean to put Orion
on a regular pension without revealing the fact that it is a pension.
That is best for him. Let him consider it a periodical loan, and pay
interest out of the principal. Within a year’s time he would be looking
upon himself as a benefactor of mine, in the way of furnishing me a good
permanent investment for money, and that would make him happy and
satisfied with himself. If he had money he would share with me in a
moment and I have no disposition to be stingy with him. Affly SAM. Livy
sends love.</p>
<p>The New Orleans plan was not wholly dead at this time. Howells wrote
near the end of January that the matter was still being debated, now and
then, but was far from being decided upon. He hoped to go somewhere with
Mrs. Howells for a brief time in March, he said. Clemens, in haste,
replied:</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Jan. 26, 1875. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–When Mrs. Clemens read your
letter she said: “Well, then, wherever they go, in March, the direction
will be southward and so they must give us a visit on the way.“ I do not
know what sort of control you may be under, but when my wife speaks as
positively as that, I am not in the habit of talking back and getting
into trouble. Situated as I am, I would not be able to understand, now,
how you could pass by this town without feeling that you were running a
wanton risk and doing a daredevil thing. I consider it settled that you
are to come in March, and I would be sincerely sorry to learn that you
and Mrs. Howells feel differently about it.</p>
<p>The piloting material has been uncovering itself by degrees, until it
has exposed such a huge hoard to my view that a whole book will be
required to contain it if I use it. So I have agreed to write the book
for Bliss. –[The book idea was later given up for the time being.]–I
won’t be able to run the articles in the Atlantic later than the
September number, for the reason that a subscription book issued in the
fall has a much larger sale than if issued at any other season of the
year. It is funny when I reflect that when I originally wrote you and
proposed to do from 6 to 9 articles for the magazine, the vague thought
in my mind was that 6 might exhaust the material and 9 would be pretty
sure to do it. Or rather it seems to me that that was my thought–can’t
tell at this distance. But in truth 9 chapters don’t now seem to more
than open up the subject fairly and start the yarn to wagging.</p>
<p>I have been sick a-bed several days, for the first time in 21 years.
How little confirmed invalids appreciate their advantages. I was able to
read the English edition of the Greville Memoirs through without
interruption, take my meals in bed, neglect all business without a pang,
and smoke 18 cigars a day. I try not to look back upon these 21 years
with a feeling of resentment, and yet the partialities of Providence do
seem to me to be slathered around (as one may say) without that gravity
and attention to detail which the real importance of the matter would
seem to suggest. Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>The New Orleans idea continued to haunt the letters. The thought of
drifting down the Mississippi so attracted both Clemens and Howells,
that they talked of it when they met, and wrote of it when they were
separated. Howells, beset by uncertainties, playfully tried to put the
responsibility upon his wife. Once he wrote: “She says in the noblest
way, ‘Well, go to New Orleans, if you want to so much’ (you know the
tone). I suppose it will do if I let you know about the middle of
February?“</p>
<p>But they had to give it up in the end. Howells wrote that he had been
under the weather, and on half work the whole winter. He did not feel
that he had earned his salary, he said, or that he was warranted in
taking a three weeks’ pleasure trip. Clemens offered to pay all the
expenses of the trip, but only indefinite postponement followed. It
would be seven years more before Mark Twain would return to the river,
and then not with Howells.</p>
<p>In a former chapter mention has been made of Charles Warren Stoddard,
whom Mark Twain had known in his California days. He was fond of
Stoddard, who was a facile and pleasing writer of poems and descriptive
articles. During the period that he had been acting as Mark Twain’s
secretary in London, he had taken pleasure in collecting for him the
news reports of the celebrated Tichborn Claimant case, then in the
English courts. Clemens thought of founding a story on it, and did, in
fact, use the idea, though ‘The American Claimant,’ which he wrote years
later, had little or no connection with the Tichborn episode.</p>
<p>To C. W. Stoddard:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Feb. 1, 1875. DEAR CHARLEY,–All right about the Tichborn
scrapbooks; send them along when convenient. I mean to have the
Beecher-Tilton trial scrap-book as a companion…..</p>
<p>I am writing a series of 7-page articles for the Atlantic at 0 a
page; but as they do not pay anybody else as much as that, I do not
complain (though at the same time I do swear that I am not content.)
However the awful respectability of the magazine makes up.</p>
<p>I have cut your articles about San Marco out of a New York paper (Joe
Twichell saw it and brought it home to me with loud admiration,) and
sent it to Howells. It is too bad to fool away such good literature in a
perishable daily journal.</p>
<p>Do remember us kindly to Lady Hardy and all that rare family–my wife
and I so often have pleasant talks about them. Ever your friend, SAML.
L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The price received by Mark Twain for the Mississippi papers, as
quoted in this letter, furnishes us with a realizing sense of the
improvement in the literary market, with the advent of a flood of cheap
magazines and the Sunday newspaper. The Atlantic page probably contained
about a thousand words, which would make his price average, say, two
cents per word. Thirty years later, when his fame was not much more
extended, his pay for the same matter would have been fifteen times as
great, that is to say, at the rate of thirty cents per word. But in that
early time there were no Sunday magazines–no literary magazines at all
except the Atlantic, and Harpers, and a few fashion periodicals.
Probably there were news-stands, but it is hard to imagine what they
must have looked like without the gay pictorial cover-femininity that
to-day pleases and elevates the public and makes author and artist
affluent.</p>
<p>Clemens worked steadily on the river chapters, and Howells was always
praising him and urging him to go on. At the end of January he wrote:
“You’re doing the science of piloting splendidly. Every word’s
interesting. And don’t you drop the series ’til you’ve got every bit of
anecdote and reminiscence into it.“</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Feb. 10, 1875. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Your praises of my
literature gave me the solidest gratification; but I never did have the
fullest confidence in my critical penetration, and now your verdict on
S—–has knocked what little I did have gully-west! I didn’t enjoy his
gush, but I thought a lot of his similes were ever so vivid and good.
But it’s just my luck; every time I go into convulsions of admiration
over a picture and want to buy it right away before I’ve lost the
chance, some wretch who really understands art comes along and damns it.
But I don’t mind. I would rather have my ignorance than another man’s
knowledge, because I have got so much more of it.</p>
<p>I send you No. 5 today. I have written and re-written the first half
of it three different times, yesterday and today, and at last
Mrs. Clemens says it will do. I never saw a woman so hard to please
about things she doesn’t know anything about. Yours ever, MARK.</p>
<p>Of course, the reference to his wife’s criticism in this is tenderly
playful, as always–of a pattern with the severity which he pretends for
her in the next.</p>
<p>To Mrs. W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>1875 DEAR MRS. HOWELLS,–Mrs. Clemens is delighted to get the
pictures, and so am I. I can perceive in the group, that Mr. Howells is
feeling as I so often feel, viz: “Well, no doubt I am in the wrong,
though I do not know how or where or why–but anyway it will be safest to
look meek, and walk circumspectly for a while, and not discuss the
thing.“ And you look exactly as Mrs. Clemens does after she has said,
“Indeed I do not wonder that you can frame no reply: for you know only
too well, that your conduct admits of no excuse, palliation or
argument–none!“</p>
<p>I shall just delight in that group on account of the good old human
domestic spirit that pervades it–bother these family groups that put on
a state aspect to get their pictures taken in.</p>
<p>We want a heliotype made of our eldest daughter. How soft and rich
and lovely the picture is. Mr. Howells must tell me how to proceed in
the matter. Truly Yours SAM. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>In the next letter we have a picture of Susy–[This spelling of the
name was adopted somewhat later and much preferred. It appears as
“Susie“ in most of the earlier letters.]–Clemens’s third birthday,
certainly a pretty picture, and as sweet and luminous and tender today
as it was forty years ago-as it will be a hundred years hence, if these
lines should survive that long. The letter is to her uncle Charles
Langdon, the “Charlie“ of the Quaker City. “Atwater“ was associated with
the Langdon coal interests in Elmira. “The play“ is, of course, “The
Gilded Age.“</p>
<p>To Charles Langdon, in Elmira:</p>
<p>Mch. 19, 1875. DEAR CHARLIE,–Livy, after reading your letter, used
her severest form of expression about Mr. Atwater–to wit: She did not
“approve“ of his conduct. This made me shudder; for it was equivalent to
Allie Spaulding’s saying “Mr. Atwater is a mean thing;“ or Rev. Thomas
Beecher’s saying “Damn that Atwater,“ or my saying “I wish Atwater was
three hundred million miles in—-!“</p>
<p>However, Livy does not often get into one of these furies, God be
thanked.</p>
<p>In Brooklyn, Baltimore, Washington, Cincinnati, St. Louis and
Chicago, the play paid me an average of nine hundred dollars a week. In
smaller towns the average is 00 to 00.</p>
<p>This is Susie’s birth-day. Lizzie brought her in at 8.30 this morning
(before we were up) hooded with a blanket, red curl-papers in her hair,
a great red japonica, in one hand (for Livy) and a yellow rose-bud
nestled in violets (for my buttonhole) in the other–and she looked
wonderfully pretty. She delivered her memorials and received her
birth-day kisses. Livy laid her japonica, down to get a better “holt“
for kissing-which Susie presently perceived, and became thoughtful: then
said sorrowfully, turning the great deeps of her eyes upon her mother:
“Don’t you care for you wow?“</p>
<p>Right after breakfast we got up a rousing wood fire in the main hall
(it is a cold morning) illuminated the place with a rich glow from all
the globes of the newell chandelier, spread a bright rug before the
fire, set a circling row of chairs (pink ones and dove-colored) and in
the midst a low invalid-table covered with a fanciful cloth and laden
with the presents–a pink azalia in lavish bloom from Rosa; a gold
inscribed Russia-leather bible from Patrick and Mary; a gold ring
(inscribed) from “Maggy Cook;“ a silver thimble (inscribed with motto
and initials) from Lizzie; a rattling mob of Sunday clad dolls from Livy
and Annie, and a Noah’s Ark from me, containing 200 wooden animals such
as only a human being could create and only God call by name without
referring to the passenger list. Then the family and the seven servants
assembled there, and Susie and the “Bay“ arrived in state from above,
the Bay’s head being fearfully and wonderfully decorated with a
profusion of blazing red flowers and overflowing cataracts of
lycopodium. Wee congratulatory notes accompanied the presents of the
servants. I tell you it was a great occasion and a striking and cheery
group, taking all the surroundings into account and the wintry aspect
outside.</p>
<p>(Remainder missing.)</p>
<p>There was to be a centennial celebration that year of the battles of
Lexington and Concord, and Howells wrote, urging Clemens and his wife to
visit them and attend it. Mrs. Clemens did not go, and Clemens and
Howells did not go, either–to the celebration. They had their own ideas
about getting there, but found themselves unable to board the thronged
train at Concord, and went tramping about in the cold and mud, hunting a
conveyance, only to return at length to the cheer of the home, defeated
and rather low in spirits.</p>
<p>Twichell, who went on his own hook, had no such difficulties. To
Howells, Mark Twain wrote the adventures of this athletic and strenuous
exponent of the gospel.</p>
<p>The “Winnie“ mentioned in this letter was Howells’s daughter
Winifred. She had unusual gifts, but did not live to develop them.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>FARMINGTON AVENUE, HARTFORD. Apl. 23, 1875. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I’ve got
Mrs. Clemens’s picture before me, and hope I shall not forget to send it
with this.</p>
<p>Joe Twichell preached morning and evening here last Sunday; took
midnight train for Boston; got an early breakfast and started by rail at
7.30 A. M. for Concord; swelled around there until 1 P. M., seeing
everything; then traveled on top of a train to Lexington; saw everything
there; traveled on top of a train to Boston, (with hundreds in company)
deluged with dust, smoke and cinders; yelled and hurrahed all the way
like a schoolboy; lay flat down to dodge numerous bridges, and sailed
into the depot, howling with excitement and as black as a chimney-sweep;
got to Young’s Hotel at 7 P. M.; sat down in reading-room and
immediately fell asleep; was promptly awakened by a porter who supposed
he was drunk; wandered around an hour and a half; then took 9 P. M.
train, sat down in smoking car and remembered nothing more until
awakened by conductor as the train came into Hartford at 1.30 A. M.
Thinks he had simply a glorious time–and wouldn’t have missed the
Centennial for the world. He would have run out to see us a moment at
Cambridge, but was too dirty. I wouldn’t have wanted him there–his
appalling energy would have been an insufferable reproach to mild
adventurers like you and me.</p>
<p>Well, he is welcome to the good time he had–I had a deal better one.
My narrative has made Mrs. Clemens wish she could have been there.–When
I think over what a splendid good sociable time I had in your house I
feel ever so thankful to the wise providence that thwarted our several
ably-planned and ingenious attempts to get to Lexington. I am coming
again before long, and then she shall be of the party.</p>
<p>Now you said that you and Mrs. Howells could run down here nearly any
Saturday. Very well then, let us call it next Saturday, for a “starter.“
Can you do that? By that time it will really be spring and you won’t
freeze. The birds are already out; a small one paid us a visit
yesterday. We entertained it and let it go again, Susie protesting.</p>
<p>The spring laziness is already upon me–insomuch that the spirit
begins to move me to cease from Mississippi articles and everything else
and give myself over to idleness until we go to New Orleans. I have one
article already finished, but somehow it doesn’t seem as proper a
chapter to close with as the one already in your hands. I hope to get in
a mood and rattle off a good one to finish with–but just now all my
moods are lazy ones.</p>
<p>Winnie’s literature sings through me yet! Surely that child has one
of these “futures“ before her.</p>
<p>Now try to come–will you?</p>
<p>With the warmest regards of the two of us– Yrs ever, S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens sent a note to Mrs. Howells, which will serve as a
pendant to the foregoing.</p>
<p>From Mrs. Clemens to Mrs. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>MY DEAR MRS. HOWELLS,–Don’t dream for one instant that my not getting
a letter from you kept me from Boston. I am too anxious to go to let
such a thing as that keep me.</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens did have such a good time with you and Mr. Howells. He
evidently has no regret that he did not get to the Centennial. I was
driven nearly distracted by his long account of Mr. Howells and his
wanderings. I would keep asking if they ever got there, he would never
answer but made me listen to a very minute account of everything that
they did. At last I found them back where they started from.</p>
<p>If you find misspelled words in this note, you will remember my
infirmity and not hold me responsible. Affectionately yours, LIVY L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>In spite of his success with the Sellers play and his itch to follow
it up, Mark Twain realized what he believed to be his literary
limitations. All his life he was inclined to consider himself wanting in
the finer gifts of character-shading and delicate portrayal. Remembering
Huck Finn, and the rare presentation of Joan of Arc, we may not
altogether agree with him. Certainly, he was never qualified to
delineate those fine artificialities of life which we are likely to
associate with culture, and perhaps it was something of this sort that
caused the hesitation confessed in the letter that follows. Whether the
plan suggested interested Howells or not we do not know. In later years
Howells wrote a novel called The Story of a Play; this may have been its
beginning.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>FARMINGTON AVENUE, HARTFORD, Apl. 26, 1875. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–An actor
named D. H. Harkins has been here to ask me to put upon paper a 5-act
play which he has been mapping out in his mind for 3 or 4 years. He sat
down and told me his plot all through, in a clear, bright way, and I was
a deal taken with it; but it is a line of characters whose fine shading
and artistic development requires an abler hand than mine; so I easily
perceived that I must not make the attempt. But I liked the man, and
thought there was a good deal of stuff in him; and therefore I wanted
his play to be written, and by a capable hand, too. So I suggested you,
and said I would write and see if you would be willing to undertake it.
If you like the idea, he will call upon you in the course of two or
three weeks and describe his plot and his characters. Then if it doesn’t
strike you favorably, of course you can simply decline; but it seems to
me well worth while that you should hear what he has to say. You could
also “average“ him while he talks, and judge whether he could play your
priest–though I doubt if any man can do that justice.</p>
<p>Shan’t I write him and say he may call? If you wish to communicate
directly with him instead, his address is “Larchmont Manor, Westchester
Co., N. Y.“</p>
<p>Do you know, the chill of that 19th of April seems to be in my bones
yet? I am inert and drowsy all the time. That was villainous weather for
a couple of wandering children to be out in. Ys ever MARK.</p>
<p>The sinister typewriter did not find its way to Howells for nearly a
year. Meantime, Mark Twain had refused to allow the manufacturers to
advertise his ownership. He wrote to them:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, March 19, 1875. Please do not use my name in any way.
Please do not even divulge the fact that I own a machine. I have
entirely stopped using the typewriter, for the reason that I never could
write a letter with it to anybody without receiving a request by return
mail that I would not only describe the machine, but state what progress
I had made in the use of it, etc., etc. I don’t like to write letters,
and so I don’t want people to know I own this curiosity-breeding little
joker.</p>
<p>Three months later the machine was still in his possession. Bliss had
traded a twelve-dollar saddle for it, but apparently showed little
enthusiasm in his new possession.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>June 25, 1875. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I told Patrick to get some carpenters
and box the machine and send it to you–and found that Bliss had sent for
the machine and earned it off.</p>
<p>I have been talking to you and writing to you as if you were present
when I traded the machine to Bliss for a twelve-dollar saddle worth 5
(cheating him outrageously, of course–but conscience got the upper hand
again and I told him before I left the premises that I’d pay for the
saddle if he didn’t like the machine–on condition that he donate said
machine to a charity)</p>
<p>This was a little over five weeks ago–so I had long ago concluded
that Bliss didn’t want the machine and did want the saddle–wherefore I
jumped at the chance of shoving the machine off onto you, saddle or no
saddle so I got the blamed thing out of my sight.</p>
<p>The saddle hangs on Tara’s walls down below in the stable, and the
machine is at Bliss’s grimly pursuing its appointed mission, slowly and
implacably rotting away another man’s chances for salvation.</p>
<p>I have sent Bliss word not to donate it to a charity (though it is a
pity to fool away a chance to do a charity an ill turn,) but to let me
know when he has got his dose, because I’ve got another candidate for
damnation. You just wait a couple of weeks and if you don’t see the
Type-Writer come tilting along toward Cambridge with an unsatisfied
appetite in its eye, I lose my guess.</p>
<p>Don’t you be mad about this blunder, Howells–it only comes of a bad
memory, and the stupidity which is inseparable from true genius. Nothing
intentionally criminal in it. Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>It was November when Howells finally fell under the baleful influence
of the machine. He wrote:</p>
<p>“The typewriter came Wednesday night, and is already beginning to
have its effect on me. Of course, it doesn’t work: if I can persuade
some of the letters to get up against the ribbon they won’t get down
again without digital assistance. The treadle refuses to have any part
or parcel in the performance; and I don’t know how to get the roller to
turn with the paper. Nevertheless I have begun several letters to My
d-a-r lemans, as it prefers to spell your respected name, and I don’t
despair yet of sending you something in its beautiful handwriting–after
I’ve had a man out from the agent’s to put it in order. It’s fascinating
in the meantime, and it wastes my time like an old friend.“</p>
<p>The Clemens family remained in Hartford that summer, with the
exception of a brief season at Bateman’s Point, R. I., near Newport. By
this time Mark Twain had taken up and finished the Tom Sawyer story
begun two years before. Naturally he wished Howells to consider the
MS.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, July 5th, 1875. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I have finished the story
and didn’t take the chap beyond boyhood. I believe it would be fatal to
do it in any shape but autobiographically–like Gil Blas. I perhaps made
a mistake in not writing it in the first person. If I went on, now, and
took him into manhood, he would just like like all the one-horse men in
literature and the reader would conceive a hearty contempt for him. It
is not a boy’s book, at all. It will only be read by adults. It is only
written for adults.</p>
<p>Moreover the book is plenty long enough as it stands. It is about 900
pages of MS, and may be 1000 when I shall have finished “working up“
vague places; so it would make from 130 to 150 pages of the Atlantic
–about what the Foregone Conclusion made, isn’t it?</p>
<p>I would dearly like to see it in the Atlantic, but I doubt if it
would pay the publishers to buy the privilege, or me to sell it. Bret
Harte has sold his novel (same size as mine, I should say) to Scribner’s
Monthly for ,500 (publication to begin in September, I think,) and he
gets a royalty of 7 1/2 per cent from Bliss in book form afterwards. He
gets a royalty of ten per cent on it in England (issued in serial
numbers) and the same royalty on it in book form afterwards, and is to
receive an advance payment of five hundred pounds the day the first
No. of the serial appears. If I could do as well, here, and there, with
mine, it might possibly pay me, but I seriously doubt it though it is
likely I could do better in England than Bret, who is not widely known
there.</p>
<p>You see I take a vile, mercenary view of things–but then my household
expenses are something almost ghastly.</p>
<p>By and by I shall take a boy of twelve and run him on through life
(in the first person) but not Tom Sawyer–he would not be a good
character for it.</p>
<p>I wish you would promise to read the MS of Tom Sawyer some time, and
see if you don’t really decide that I am right in closing with him as a
boy –and point out the most glaring defects for me. It is a tremendous
favor to ask, and I expect you to refuse and would be ashamed to expect
you to do otherwise. But the thing has been so many months in my mind
that it seems a relief to snake it out. I don’t know any other person
whose judgment I could venture to take fully and entirely. Don’t
hesitate about saying no, for I know how your time is taxed, and I would
have honest need to blush if you said yes.</p>
<p>Osgood and I are “going for“ the puppy G—- on infringement of
trademark. To win one or two suits of this kind will set literary folks
on a firmer bottom. I wish Osgood would sue for stealing Holmes’s poem.
Wouldn’t it be gorgeous to sue R—- for petty larceny? I will promise to
go into court and swear I think him capable of stealing pea-nuts from a
blind pedlar. Yrs ever, CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Of course Howells promptly replied that he would read the story,
adding: “You’ve no idea what I may ask you to do for me, some day. I’m
sorry that you can’t do it for the Atlantic, but I succumb. Perhaps you
will do Boy No. 2 for us.“ Clemens, conscience-stricken, meantime,
hastily put the MS. out of reach of temptation.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>July 13, 1875 MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Just as soon as you consented I
realized all the atrocity of my request, and straightway blushed and
weakened. I telegraphed my theatrical agent to come here and carry off
the MS and copy it.</p>
<p>But I will gladly send it to you if you will do as follows: dramatize
it, if you perceive that you can, and take, for your remuneration, half
of the first 000 which I receive for its representation on the stage.
You could alter the plot entirely, if you chose. I could help in the
work, most cheerfully, after you had arranged the plot. I have my eye
upon two young girls who can play “Tom“ and “Huck.“ I believe a good
deal of a drama can be made of it. Come–can’t you tackle this in the odd
hours of your vacation? or later, if you prefer?</p>
<p>I do wish you could come down once more before your holiday. I’d give
anything! Yrs ever, MARK.</p>
<p>Howells wrote that he had no time for the dramatization and urged
Clemens to undertake it himself. He was ready to read the story,
whenever it should arrive. Clemens did not hurry, however, The
publication of Tom Sawyer could wait. He already had a book in press–the
volume of Sketches New and Old, which he had prepared for Bliss several
years before.</p>
<p>Sketches was issued that autumn, and Howells gave it a good notice
–possibly better than it deserved.</p>
<p>Considered among Mark Twain’s books to-day, the collection of
sketches does not seem especially important. With the exception of the
frog story and the “True Story“ most of those included–might be spared.
Clemens himself confessed to Howells that He wished, when it was too
late, that he had destroyed a number of them. The book, however, was
distinguished in a special way: it contains Mark Twain’s first utterance
in print on the subject of copyright, a matter in which he never again
lost interest. The absurdity and injustice of the copyright laws both
amused and irritated him, and in the course of time he would be largely
instrumental in their improvement. In the book his open petition to
Congress that all property rights, as well as literary ownership, should
be put on the copyright basis and limited to a “beneficent term of
forty-two years,“ was more or less of a joke, but, like so many of Mark
Twain’s jokes, it was founded on reason and justice.</p>
<p>He had another idea, that was not a joke: an early plan in the
direction of international copyright. It was to be a petition signed by
the leading American authors, asking the United States to declare itself
to be the first to stand for right and justice by enacting laws against
the piracy of foreign books. It was a rather utopian scheme, as most
schemes for moral progress are, in their beginning. It would not be
likely ever to reach Congress, but it would appeal to Howells and his
Cambridge friends. Clemens wrote, outlining his plan of action.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Sept. 18, 1875. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–My plan is this–you are to
get Mr. Lowell and Mr. Longfellow to be the first signers of my
copyright petition; you must sign it yourself and get Mr. Whittier to do
likewise. Then Holmes will sign–he said he would if he didn’t have to
stand at the head. Then I’m fixed. I will then put a gentlemanly chap
under wages and send him personally to every author of distinction in
the country, and corral the rest of the signatures. Then I’ll have the
whole thing lithographed (about a thousand copies) and move upon the
President and Congress in person, but in the subordinate capacity of a
party who is merely the agent of better and wiser men–men whom the
country cannot venture to laugh at.</p>
<p>I will ask the President to recommend the thing in his message (and
if he should ask me to sit down and frame the paragraph for him I should
blush –but still I would frame it.)</p>
<p>Next I would get a prime leader in Congress: I would also see that
votes enough to carry the measure were privately secured before the bill
was offered. This I would try through my leader and my friends
there.</p>
<p>And then if Europe chose to go on stealing from us, we would say with
noble enthusiasm, “American lawmakers do steal but not from foreign
authors–Not from foreign authors!“</p>
<p>You see, what I want to drive into the Congressional mind is the
simple fact that the moral law is “Thou shalt not steal“–no matter what
Europe may do.</p>
<p>I swear I can’t see any use in robbing European authors for the
benefit of American booksellers, anyway.</p>
<p>If we can ever get this thing through Congress, we can try making
copyright perpetual, some day. There would be no sort of use in it,
since only one book in a hundred millions outlives the present copyright
term–no sort of use except that the writer of that one book have his
rights–which is something.</p>
<p>If we only had some God in the country’s laws, instead of being in
such a sweat to get Him into the Constitution, it would be better all
around.</p>
<p>The only man who ever signed my petition with alacrity, and said that
the fact that a thing was right was all-sufficient, was
Rev. Dr. Bushnell.</p>
<p>I have lost my old petition, (which was brief) but will draft and
enclose another–not in the words it ought to be, but in the substance. I
want Mr. Lowell to furnish the words (and the ideas too,) if he will do
it.</p>
<p>Say–Redpath beseeches me to lecture in Boston in November–telegraphs
that Beecher’s and Nast’s withdrawal has put him in the tightest kind of
a place. So I guess I’ll do that old “Roughing It“ lecture over again in
November and repeat it 2 or 3 times in New York while I am at it.</p>
<p>Can I take a carriage after the lecture and go out and stay with you
that night, provided you find at that distant time that it will not
inconvenience you? Is Aldrich home yet? With love to you all Yrs ever,
S. L. C.</p>
<p>Of course the petition never reached Congress. Holmes’s comment that
governments were not in the habit of setting themselves up as high moral
examples, except for revenue, was shared by too many others. The
petition was tabled, but Clemens never abandoned his purpose and lived
to see most of his dream fulfilled. Meantime, Howells’s notice of the
Sketches appeared in the Atlantic, and brought grateful acknowledgment
from the author.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Oct. 19, 1875. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–That is a perfectly superb
notice. You can easily believe that nothing ever gratified me so much
before. The newspaper praises bestowed upon the “Innocents Abroad“ were
large and generous, but somehow I hadn’t confidence in the critical
judgement of the parties who furnished them. You know how that is,
yourself, from reading the newspaper notices of your own books. They
gratify a body, but they always leave a small pang behind in the shape
of a fear that the critic’s good words could not safely be depended upon
as authority. Yours is the recognized critical Court of Last Resort in
this country; from its decision there is no appeal; and so, to have
gained this decree of yours before I am forty years old, I regard as a
thing to be right down proud of. Mrs. Clemens says, “Tell him I am just
as grateful to him as I can be.“ (It sounds as if she were grateful to
you for heroically trampling the truth under foot in order to praise me
but in reality it means that she is grateful to you for being bold
enough to utter a truth which she fully believes all competent people
know, but which none has heretofore been brave enough to utter.) You
see, the thing that gravels her is that I am so persistently glorified
as a mere buffoon, as if that entirely covered my case–which she denies
with venom.</p>
<p>The other day Mrs. Clemens was planning a visit to you, and so I am
waiting with a pleasurable hope for the result of her deliberations. We
are expecting visitors every day, now, from New York; and afterward some
are to come from Elmira. I judge that we shall then be free to go
Bostonward. I should be just delighted; because we could visit in
comfort, since we shouldn’t have to do any shopping–did it all in New
York last week, and a tremendous pull it was too.</p>
<p>Mrs. C. said the other day, “We will go to Cambridge if we have to
walk; for I don’t believe we can ever get the Howellses to come here
again until we have been there.“ I was gratified to see that there was
one string, anyway, that could take her to Cambridge. But I will do her
the justice to say that she is always wanting to go to Cambridge,
independent of the selfish desire to get a visit out of you by it. I
want her to get started, now, before children’s diseases are fashionable
again, because they always play such hob with visiting arrangements.
With love to you all Yrs Ever S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Mark Twain’s trips to Boston were usually made alone. Women require
more preparation to go visiting, and Mrs. Clemens and Mrs. Howells seem
to have exchanged visits infrequently. For Mark Twain, perhaps, it was
just as well that his wife did not always go with him; his
absent-mindedness and boyish ingenuousness often led him into
difficulties which Mrs. Clemens sometimes found embarrassing. In the
foregoing letter they were planning a visit to Cambridge. In the one
that follows they seem to have made it–with certain results, perhaps not
altogether amusing at the moment.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>Oct. 4, ’75. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–We had a royal good time at your house,
and have had a royal good time ever since, talking about it, both
privately and with the neighbors.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens’s bodily strength came up handsomely under that cheery
respite from household and nursery cares. I do hope that Mrs. Howells’s
didn’t go correspondingly down, under the added burden to her cares and
responsibilities. Of course I didn’t expect to get through without
committing some crimes and hearing of them afterwards, so I have taken
the inevitable lashings and been able to hum a tune while the punishment
went on. I “caught it“ for letting Mrs. Howells bother and bother about
her coffee when it was “a good deal better than we get at home.“ I
“caught it“ for interrupting Mrs. C. at the last moment and losing her
the opportunity to urge you not to forget to send her that MS when the
printers are done with it. I “caught it“ once more for personating that
drunken Col. James. I “caught it“ for mentioning that Mr. Longfellow’s
picture was slightly damaged; and when, after a lull in the storm, I
confessed, shame-facedly, that I had privately suggested to you that we
hadn’t any frames, and that if you wouldn’t mind hinting to
Mr. Houghton, andandandandc., andandandandc., andandandandc., the Madam
was simply speechless for the space of a minute. Then she said:</p>
<p>“How could you, Youth! The idea of sending Mr. Howells, with his
sensitive nature, upon such a repulsive er–“</p>
<p>“Oh, Howells won’t mind it! You don’t know Howells. Howells is a man
who–“ She was gone. But George was the first person she stumbled on in
the hall, so she took it out of George. I was glad of that, because it
saved the babies.</p>
<p>I’ve got another rattling good character for my novel! That great
work is mulling itself into shape gradually.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens sends love to Mrs. Howells–meantime she is diligently
laying up material for a letter to her. Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>The “George“ of this letter was Mark Twain’s colored butler, a valued
and even beloved member of the household–a most picturesque character,
who “one day came to wash windows,“ as Clemens used to say, “and
remained eighteen years.“ The fiction of Mrs. Clemens’s severity he
always found amusing, because of its entire contrast with the reality of
her gentle heart.</p>
<p>Clemens carried the Tom Sawyer MS. to Boston himself and placed it in
Howells’s hands. Howells had begged to be allowed to see the story, and
Mrs. Clemens was especially anxious that he should do so. She had doubts
as to certain portions of it, and had the fullest faith in Howells’s
opinion.</p>
<p>It was a gratifying one when it came. Howells wrote: “I finished
reading Tom Sawyer a week ago, sitting up till one A.M. to get to the
end, simply because it was impossible to leave off. It’s altogether the
best boy’s story I ever read. It will be an immense success. But I think
you ought to treat it explicitly as a boy’s story. Grown-ups will enjoy
it just as much if you do; and if you should put it forth as a study of
boy character from the grown-up point of view, you give the wrong key to
it…. The adventures are enchanting. I wish I had been on that island.
The treasure-hunting, the loss in the cave–it’s all exciting and
splendid. I shouldn’t think of publishing this story serially. Give me a
hint when it’s to be out, and I’ll start the sheep to jumping in the
right places“–meaning that he would have an advance review ready for
publication in the Atlantic, which was a leader of criticism in
America.</p>
<p>Mark Twain was writing a great deal at this time. Howells was always
urging him to send something to the Atlantic, declaring a willingness to
have his name appear every month in their pages, and Clemens was
generally contributing some story or sketch. The “proof“ referred to in
the next letter was of one of these articles.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Nov. 23, ’75. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Herewith is the proof. In
spite of myself, how awkwardly I do jumble words together; and how often
I do use three words where one would answer–a thing I am always trying
to guard against. I shall become as slovenly a writer as Charles Francis
Adams, if I don’t look out. (That is said in jest; because of course I
do not seriously fear getting so bad as that. I never shall drop so far
toward his and Bret Harte’s level as to catch myself saying “It must
have been wiser to have believed that he might have accomplished it if
he could have felt that he would have been supported by those who should
have andandandandc. andandandandc. andandandandc.“) The reference to
Bret Harte reminds me that I often accuse him of being a deliberate
imitator of Dickens; and this in turn reminds me that I have charged
unconscious plagiarism upon Charley Warner; and this in turn reminds me
that I have been delighting my soul for two weeks over a bran new and
ingenious way of beginning a novel–and behold, all at once it flashes
upon me that Charley Warner originated the idea 3 years ago and told me
about it! Aha! So much for self-righteousness! I am well repaid. Here
are 108 pages of MS, new and clean, lying disgraced in the waste paper
basket, and I am beginning the novel over again in an unstolen way. I
would not wonder if I am the worst literary thief in the world, without
knowing it.</p>
<p>It is glorious news that you like Tom Sawyer so well. I mean to see
to it that your review of it shall have plenty of time to appear before
the other notices. Mrs. Clemens decides with you that the book should
issue as a book for boys, pure and simple–and so do I. It is surely the
correct idea. As to that last chapter, I think of just leaving it off
and adding nothing in its place. Something told me that the book was
done when I got to that point–and so the strong temptation to put Huck’s
life at the Widow’s into detail, instead of generalizing it in a
paragraph was resisted. Just send Sawyer to me by express–I enclose
money for it. If it should get lost it will be no great matter.</p>
<p>Company interfered last night, and so “Private Theatricals“ goes over
till this evening, to be read aloud. Mrs. Clemens is mad, but the story
will take that all out. This is going to be a splendid winter night for
fireside reading, anyway.</p>
<p>I am almost at a dead stand-still with my new story, on account of
the misery of having to do it all over again. We–all send love to
you–all. Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>The “story“ referred to may have been any one of several begun by him
at this time. His head was full of ideas for literature of every sort.
Many of his beginnings came to nothing, for the reason that he started
wrong, or with no definitely formed plan. Others of his literary
enterprises were condemned by his wife for their grotesqueness or for
the offense they might give in one way or another, however worthy the
intention behind them. Once he wrote a burlesque on family history “The
Autobiography of a Damned Fool.“ “Livy wouldn’t have it,“ he said later,
“so I gave it up.“ The world is indebted to Mark Twain’s wife for the
check she put upon his fantastic or violent impulses. She was his
public, his best public–clearheaded and wise. That he realized this, and
was willing to yield, was by no means the least of his good fortunes. We
may believe that he did not always yield easily, and perhaps sometimes
only out of love for her. In the letter which he wrote her on her
thirtieth birthday we realize something of what she had come to mean in
his life.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens on her Thirtieth Birthday:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, November 27, 1875. Livy darling, six years have gone by
since I made my first great success in life and won you, and thirty
years have passed since Providence made preparation for that happy
success by sending you into the world. Every day we live together adds
to the security of my confidence, that we can never any more wish to be
separated than that we can ever imagine a regret that we were ever
joined. You are dearer to me to-day, my child, than you were upon the
last anniversary of this birth-day; you were dearer then than you were a
year before–you have grown more and more dear from the first of those
anniversaries, and I do not doubt that this precious progression will
continue on to the end.</p>
<p>Let us look forward to the coming anniversaries, with their age and
their gray hairs without fear and without depression, trusting and
believing that the love we bear each other will be sufficient to make
them blessed.</p>
<p>So, with abounding affection for you and our babies, I hail this day
that brings you the matronly grace and dignity of three decades!</p>
<p>Always Yours S. L. C.</p>
