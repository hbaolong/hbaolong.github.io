<h4 id="chapter-xlix.">CHAPTER XLIX.</h4>
<p>He had had much experience of physicians, and said “the only way to
keep your health is to eat what you don’t want, drink what; you don’t
like, and do what you’d druther not.“ –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New
Calendar.</p>
<p>It was a long journey–two nights, one day, and part of another day,
from Bombay eastward to Allahabad; but it was always interesting, and it
was not fatiguing. At first the, night travel promised to be fatiguing,
but that was on account of pyjamas. This foolish night-dress consists of
jacket and drawers. Sometimes they are made of silk, sometimes of a
raspy, scratchy, slazy woolen material with a sandpaper surface. The
drawers are loose elephant-legged and elephant-waisted things, and
instead of buttoning around the body there is a drawstring to produce
the required shrinkage. The jacket is roomy, and one buttons it in
front. Pyjamas are hot on a hot night and cold on a cold night–defects
which a nightshirt is free from. I tried the pyjamas in order to be in
the fashion; but I was obliged to give them up, I couldn’t stand them.
There was no sufficient change from day-gear to night-gear. I missed the
refreshing and luxurious sense, induced by the night-gown, of being
undressed, emancipated, set free from restraints and trammels. In place
of that, I had the worried, confined, oppressed, suffocated sense of
being abed with my clothes on. All through the warm half of the night
the coarse surfaces irritated my skin and made it feel baked and
feverish, and the dreams which came in the fitful flurries of slumber
were such as distress the sleep of the damned, or ought to; and all
through the cold other half of the night I could get no time for sleep
because I had to employ it all in stealing blankets. But blankets are of
no value at such a time; the higher they are piled the more effectively
they cork the cold in and keep it from getting out. The result is that
your legs are ice, and you know how you will feel by and by when you are
buried. In a sane interval I discarded the pyjamas, and led a rational
and comfortable life thenceforth.</p>
<p>Out in the country in India, the day begins early. One sees a plain,
perfectly flat, dust-colored and brick-yardy, stretching limitlessly
away on every side in the dim gray light, striped everywhere with
hard-beaten narrow paths, the vast flatness broken at wide intervals by
bunches of spectral trees that mark where villages are; and along all
the paths are slender women and the black forms of lanky naked men
moving, to their work, the women with brass water-jars on their heads,
the men carrying hoes. The man is not entirely naked; always there is a
bit of white rag, a loin-cloth; it amounts to a bandage, and is a white
accent on his black person, like the silver band around the middle of a
pipe-stem. Sometimes he also wears a fluffy and voluminous white turban,
and this adds a second accent. He then answers properly to Miss Gordon
Cumming’s flash-light picture of him–as a person who is dressed in “a
turban and a pocket handkerchief.“</p>
<p>All day long one has this monotony of dust-colored dead levels and
scattering bunches of trees and mud villages. You soon realize that
India is not beautiful; still there is an enchantment about it that is
beguiling, and which does not pall. You cannot tell just what it is that
makes the spell, perhaps, but you feel it and confess it, nevertheless.
Of course, at bottom, you know in a vague way that it is history; it is
that that affects you, a haunting sense of the myriads of human lives
that have blossomed, and withered, and perished here, repeating and
repeating and repeating, century after century, and age after age, the
barren and meaningless process; it is this sense that gives to this
forlorn, uncomely land power to speak to the spirit and make friends
with it; to, speak to it with a voice bitter with satire, but eloquent
with melancholy. The deserts of Australia and the ice-barrens of
Greenland have no speech, for they have no venerable history; with
nothing to tell of man and his vanities, his fleeting glories and his
miseries, they have nothing wherewith to spiritualize their ugliness and
veil it with a charm.</p>
<p>There is nothing pretty about an Indian village–a mud one–and I do
not remember that we saw any but mud ones on that long flight to
Allahabad. It is a little bunch of dirt-colored mud hovels jammed
together within a mud wall. As a rule, the rains had beaten down parts
of some of the houses, and this gave the village the aspect of a
mouldering and hoary ruin. I believe the cattle and the vermin live
inside the wall; for I saw cattle coming out and cattle going in; and
whenever I saw a villager, he was scratching. This last is only
circumstantial evidence, but I think it has value. The village has a
battered little temple or two, big enough to hold an idol, and with
custom enough to fat-up a priest and keep him comfortable. Where there
are Mohammedans there are generally a few sorry tombs outside the
village that have a decayed and neglected look. The villages interested
me because of things which Major Sleeman says about them in his
books–particularly what he says about the division of labor in them. He
says that the whole face of India is parceled out into estates of
villages; that nine-tenths of the vast population of the land consist of
cultivators of the soil; that it is these cultivators who inhabit the
villages; that there are certain “established“ village
servants–mechanics and others who are apparently paid a wage by the
village at large, and whose callings remain in certain families and are
handed down from father to son, like an estate. He gives a list of these
established servants: Priest, blacksmith, carpenter, accountant,
washerman, basketmaker, potter, watchman, barber, shoemaker, brazier,
confectioner, weaver, dyer, etc. In his day witches abounded, and it was
not thought good business wisdom for a man to marry his daughter into a
family that hadn’t a witch in it, for she would need a witch on the
premises to protect her children from the evil spells which would
certainly be cast upon them by the witches connected with the
neighboring families.</p>
<p>The office of midwife was hereditary in the family of the
basket-maker. It belonged to his wife. She might not be competent, but
the office was hers, anyway. Her pay was not high–25 cents for a boy,
and half as much for a girl. The girl was not desired, because she would
be a disastrous expense by and by. As soon as she should be old enough
to begin to wear clothes for propriety’s sake, it would be a disgrace to
the family if she were not married; and to marry her meant financial
ruin; for by custom the father must spend upon feasting and
wedding-display everything he had and all he could borrow–in fact,
reduce himself to a condition of poverty which he might never more
recover from.</p>
<p>It was the dread of this prospective ruin which made the killing of
girl-babies so prevalent in India in the old days before England laid
the iron hand of her prohibitions upon the piteous slaughter. One may
judge of how prevalent the custom was, by one of Sleeman’s casual
electrical remarks, when he speaks of children at play in villages–where
girl-voices were never heard!</p>
<p>The wedding-display folly is still in full force in India, and by
consequence the destruction of girl-babies is still furtively practiced;
but not largely, because of the vigilance of the government and the
sternness of the penalties it levies.</p>
<p>In some parts of India the village keeps in its pay three other
servants: an astrologer to tell the villager when he may plant his crop,
or make a journey, or marry a wife, or strangle a child, or borrow a
dog, or climb a tree, or catch a rat, or swindle a neighbor, without
offending the alert and solicitous heavens; and what his dream means, if
he has had one and was not bright enough to interpret it himself by the
details of his dinner; the two other established servants were the
tiger-persuader and the hailstorm discourager. The one kept away the
tigers if he could, and collected the wages anyway, and the other kept
off the hailstorms, or explained why he failed. He charged the same for
explaining a failure that he did for scoring a success. A man is an
idiot who can’t earn a living in India.</p>
<p>Major Sleeman reveals the fact that the trade union and the boycott
are antiquities in India. India seems to have originated everything. The
“sweeper“ belongs to the bottom caste; he is the lowest of the low–all
other castes despise him and scorn his office. But that does not trouble
him. His caste is a caste, and that is sufficient for him, and so he is
proud of it, not ashamed. Sleeman says:</p>
<p>“It is perhaps not known to many of my countrymen, even in India,
that in every town and city in the country the right of sweeping the
houses and streets is a monopoly, and is supported entirely by the pride
of castes among the scavengers, who are all of the lowest class. The
right of sweeping within a certain range is recognized by the caste to
belong to a certain member; and if any other member presumes to sweep
within that range, he is excommunicated–no other member will smoke out
of his pipe or drink out of his jug; and he can get restored to caste
only by a feast to the whole body of sweepers. If any housekeeper within
a particular circle happens to offend the sweeper of that range, none of
his filth will be removed till he pacifies him, because no other sweeper
will dare to touch it; and the people of a town are often more
tyrannized over by these people than by any other.“</p>
<p>A footnote by Major Sleeman’s editor, Mr. Vincent Arthur Smith, says
that in our day this tyranny of the sweepers’ guild is one of the many
difficulties which bar the progress of Indian sanitary reform. Think of
this:</p>
<p>“The sweepers cannot be readily coerced, because no Hindoo or
Mussulman would do their work to save his life, nor will he pollute
himself by beating the refractory scavenger.“</p>
<p>They certainly do seem to have the whip-hand; it would be difficult
to imagine a more impregnable position. “The vested rights described in
the text are so fully recognized in practice that they are frequently
the subject of sale or mortgage.“</p>
<p>Just like a milk-route; or like a London crossing-sweepership. It is
said that the London crossing-sweeper’s right to his crossing is
recognized by the rest of the guild; that they protect him in its
possession; that certain choice crossings are valuable property, and are
saleable at high figures. I have noticed that the man who sweeps in
front of the Army and Navy Stores has a wealthy South African
aristocratic style about him; and when he is off his guard, he has
exactly that look on his face which you always see in the face of a man
who has is saving up his daughter to marry her to a duke.</p>
<p>It appears from Sleeman that in India the occupation of
elephant-driver is confined to Mohammedans. I wonder why that is. The
water-carrier (‘bheestie’) is a Mohammedan, but it is said that the
reason of that is, that the Hindoo’s religion does not allow him to
touch the skin of dead kine, and that is what the water-sack is made of;
it would defile him. And it doesn’t allow him to eat meat; the animal
that furnished the meat was murdered, and to take any creature’s life is
a sin. It is a good and gentle religion, but inconvenient.</p>
<p>A great Indian river, at low water, suggests the familiar anatomical
picture of a skinned human body, the intricate mesh of interwoven
muscles and tendons to stand for water-channels, and the archipelagoes
of fat and flesh inclosed by them to stand for the sandbars. Somewhere
on this journey we passed such a river, and on a later journey we saw in
the Sutlej the duplicate of that river. Curious rivers they are; low
shores a dizzy distance apart, with nothing between but an enormous
acreage of sand-flats with sluggish little veins of water dribbling
around amongst them; Saharas of sand, smallpox-pitted with footprints
punctured in belts as straight as the equator clear from the one shore
to the other (barring the channel-interruptions)–a dry-shod ferry, you
see. Long railway bridges are required for this sort of rivers, and
India has them. You approach Allahabad by a very long one. It was now
carrying us across the bed of the Jumna, a bed which did not seem to
have been slept in for one while or more. It wasn’t all river-bed–most
of it was overflow ground.</p>
<p>Allahabad means “City of God.“ I get this from the books. From a
printed curiosity–a letter written by one of those brave and confident
Hindoo strugglers with the English tongue, called a “babu“–I got a more
compressed translation: “Godville.“ It is perfectly correct, but that is
the most that can be said for it.</p>
<p>We arrived in the forenoon, and short-handed; for Satan got left
behind somewhere that morning, and did not overtake us until after
nightfall. It seemed very peaceful without him. The world seemed asleep
and dreaming.</p>
<p>I did not see the native town, I think. I do not remember why; for an
incident connects it with the Great Mutiny, and that is enough to make
any place interesting. But I saw the English part of the city. It is a
town of wide avenues and noble distances, and is comely and alluring,
and full of suggestions of comfort and leisure, and of the serenity
which a good conscience buttressed by a sufficient bank account gives.
The bungalows (dwellings) stand well back in the seclusion and privacy
of large enclosed compounds (private grounds, as we should say) and in
the shade and shelter of trees. Even the photographer and the prosperous
merchant ply their industries in the elegant reserve of big compounds,
and the citizens drive in thereupon their business occasions. And not in
cabs–no; in the Indian cities cabs are for the drifting stranger; all
the white citizens have private carriages; and each carriage has a flock
of white-turbaned black footmen and drivers all over it. The vicinity of
a lecture-hall looks like a snowstorm,–and makes the lecturer feel like
an opera. India has many names, and they are correctly descriptive. It
is the Land of Contradictions, the Land of Subtlety and Superstition,
the Land of Wealth and Poverty, the Land of Splendor and Desolation, the
Land of Plague and Famine, the Land of the Thug and the Poisoner, and of
the Meek and the Patient, the Land of the Suttee, the Land of the
Unreinstatable Widow, the Land where All Life is Holy, the Land of
Cremation, the Land where the Vulture is a Grave and a Monument, the
Land of the Multitudinous Gods; and if signs go for anything, it is the
Land of the Private Carriage.</p>
<p>In Bombay the forewoman of a millinery shop came to the hotel in her
private carriage to take the measure for a gown–not for me, but for
another. She had come out to India to make a temporary stay, but was
extending it indefinitely; indeed, she was purposing to end her days
there. In London, she said, her work had been hard, her hours long; for
economy’s sake she had had to live in shabby rooms and far away from the
shop, watch the pennies, deny herself many of the common comforts of
life, restrict herself in effect to its bare necessities, eschew cabs,
travel third-class by underground train to and from her work, swallowing
coal-smoke and cinders all the way, and sometimes troubled with the
society of men and women who were less desirable than the smoke and the
cinders. But in Bombay, on almost any kind of wages, she could live in
comfort, and keep her carriage, and have six servants in place of the
woman-of-all-work she had had in her English home. Later, in Calcutta, I
found that the Standard Oil clerks had small one-horse vehicles, and did
no walking; and I was told that the clerks of the other large concerns
there had the like equipment. But to return to Allahabad.</p>
<p>I was up at dawn, the next morning. In India the tourist’s servant
does not sleep in a room in the hotel, but rolls himself up head and
ears in his blanket and stretches himself on the veranda, across the
front of his master’s door, and spends the night there. I don’t believe
anybody’s servant occupies a room. Apparently, the bungalow servants
sleep on the veranda; it is roomy, and goes all around the house. I
speak of menservants; I saw none of the other sex. I think there are
none, except child-nurses. I was up at dawn, and walked around the
veranda, past the rows of sleepers. In front of one door a Hindoo
servant was squatting, waiting for his master to call him. He had
polished the yellow shoes and placed them by the door, and now he had
nothing to do but wait. It was freezing cold, but there he was, as
motionless as a sculptured image, and as patient. It troubled me. I
wanted to say to him, “Don’t crouch there like that and freeze; nobody
requires it of you; stir around and get warm.“ But I hadn’t the words. I
thought of saying ‘jeldy jow’, but I couldn’t remember what it meant, so
I didn’t say it. I knew another phrase, but it wouldn’t come to my mind.
I moved on, purposing to dismiss him from my thoughts, but his bare legs
and bare feet kept him there. They kept drawing me back from the sunny
side to a point whence I could see him. At the end of an hour he had not
changed his attitude in the least degree. It was a curious and
impressive exhibition of meekness and patience, or fortitude or
indifference, I did not know which. But it worried me, and it was
spoiling my morning. In fact, it spoiled two hours of it quite
thoroughly. I quitted this vicinity, then, and left him to punish
himself as much as he might want to. But up to that time the man had not
changed his attitude a hair. He will always remain with me, I suppose;
his figure never grows vague in my memory. Whenever I read of Indian
resignation, Indian patience under wrongs, hardships, and misfortunes,
he comes before me. He becomes a personification, and stands for India
in trouble. And for untold ages India in trouble has been pursued with
the very remark which I was going to utter but didn’t, because its
meaning had slipped me: “Jeddy jow!“ (“Come, shove along!“)</p>
<p>Why, it was the very thing.</p>
<p>In the early brightness we made a long drive out to the Fort. Part of
the way was beautiful. It led under stately trees and through groups of
native houses and by the usual village well, where the picturesque gangs
are always flocking to and fro and laughing and chattering; and this
time brawny men were deluging their bronze bodies with the limpid water,
and making a refreshing and enticing show of it; enticing, for the sun
was already transacting business, firing India up for the day. There was
plenty of this early bathing going on, for it was getting toward
breakfast time, and with an unpurified body the Hindoo must not eat.</p>
<p>Then we struck into the hot plain, and found the roads crowded with
pilgrims of both sexes, for one of the great religious fairs of India
was being held, just beyond the Fort, at the junction of the sacred
rivers, the Ganges and the Jumna. Three sacred rivers, I should have
said, for there is a subterranean one. Nobody has seen it, but that
doesn’t signify. The fact that it is there is enough. These pilgrims had
come from all over India; some of them had been months on the way,
plodding patiently along in the heat and dust, worn, poor, hungry, but
supported and sustained by an unwavering faith and belief; they were
supremely happy and content, now; their full and sufficient reward was
at hand; they were going to be cleansed from every vestige of sin and
corruption by these holy waters which make utterly pure whatsoever thing
they touch, even the dead and rotten. It is wonderful, the power of a
faith like that, that can make multitudes upon multitudes of the old and
weak and the young and frail enter without hesitation or complaint upon
such incredible journeys and endure the resultant miseries without
repining. It is done in love, or it is done in fear; I do not know which
it is. No matter what the impulse is, the act born of it is beyond
imagination marvelous to our kind of people, the cold whites. There are
choice great natures among us that could exhibit the equivalent of this
prodigious self-sacrifice, but the rest of us know that we should not be
equal to anything approaching it. Still, we all talk self-sacrifice, and
this makes me hope that we are large enough to honor it in the
Hindoo.</p>
<p>Two millions of natives arrive at this fair every year. How many
start, and die on the road, from age and fatigue and disease and scanty
nourishment, and how many die on the return, from the same causes, no
one knows; but the tale is great, one may say enormous. Every twelfth
year is held to be a year of peculiar grace; a greatly augmented volume
of pilgrims results then. The twelfth year has held this distinction
since the remotest times, it is said. It is said also that there is to
be but one more twelfth year–for the Ganges. After that, that holiest of
all sacred rivers will cease to be holy, and will be abandoned by the
pilgrim for many centuries; how many, the wise men have not stated. At
the end of that interval it will become holy again. Meantime, the data
will be arranged by those people who have charge of all such matters,
the great chief Brahmins. It will be like shutting down a mint. At a
first glance it looks most unbrahminically uncommercial, but I am not
disturbed, being soothed and tranquilized by their reputation. “Brer fox
he lay low,“ as Uncle Remus says; and at the judicious time he will
spring something on the Indian public which will show that he was not
financially asleep when he took the Ganges out of the market.</p>
<p>Great numbers of the natives along the roads were bringing away holy
water from the rivers. They would carry it far and wide in India and
sell it. Tavernier, the French traveler (17th century), notes that
Ganges water is often given at weddings, “each guest receiving a cup or
two, according to the liberality of the host; sometimes 2,000 or 3,000
rupees’ worth of it is consumed at a wedding.“</p>
<p>The Fort is a huge old structure, and has had a large experience in
religions. In its great court stands a monolith which was placed there
more than 2,000 years ago to preach (Budhism) by its pious inscription;
the Fort was built three centuries ago by a Mohammedan Emperor–a
resanctification of the place in the interest of that religion. There is
a Hindoo temple, too, with subterranean ramifications stocked with
shrines and idols; and now the Fort belongs to the English, it contains
a Christian Church. Insured in all the companies.</p>
<p>From the lofty ramparts one has a fine view of the sacred rivers.
They join at that point–the pale blue Jumna, apparently clean and clear,
and the muddy Ganges, dull yellow and not clean. On a long curved spit
between the rivers, towns of tents were visible, with a multitude of
fluttering pennons, and a mighty swarm of pilgrims. It was a troublesome
place to get down to, and not a quiet place when you arrived; but it was
interesting. There was a world of activity and turmoil and noise, partly
religious, partly commercial; for the Mohammedans were there to curse
and sell, and the Hindoos to buy and pray. It is a fair as well as a
religious festival. Crowds were bathing, praying, and drinking the
purifying waters, and many sick pilgrims had come long journeys in
palanquins to be healed of their maladies by a bath; or if that might
not be, then to die on the blessed banks and so make sure of heaven.
There were fakeers in plenty, with their bodies dusted over with ashes
and their long hair caked together with cow-dung; for the cow is holy
and so is the rest of it; so holy that the good Hindoo peasant frescoes
the walls of his hut with this refuse, and also constructs ornamental
figures out of it for the gracing of his dirt floor. There were seated
families, fearfully and wonderfully painted, who by attitude and
grouping represented the families of certain great gods. There was a
holy man who sat naked by the day and by the week on a cluster of iron
spikes, and did not seem to mind it; and another holy man, who stood all
day holding his withered arms motionless aloft, and was said to have
been doing it for years. All of these performers have a cloth on the
ground beside them for the reception of contributions, and even the
poorest of the people give a trifle and hope that the sacrifice will be
blessed to him. At last came a procession of naked holy people marching
by and chanting, and I wrenched myself away.</p>
