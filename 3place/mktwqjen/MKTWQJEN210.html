<h4 id="to-raise-poultry">TO RAISE POULTRY</h4>
<p>–[Being a letter written to a Poultry Society that had conferred a
complimentary membership upon the author. Written about 1870.]</p>
<p>Seriously, from early youth I have taken an especial interest in the
subject of poultry-raising, and so this membership touches a ready
sympathy in my breast. Even as a schoolboy, poultry-raising was a study
with me, and I may say without egotism that as early as the age of
seventeen I was acquainted with all the best and speediest methods of
raising chickens, from raising them off a roost by burning lucifer
matches under their noses, down to lifting them off a fence on a frosty
night by insinuating the end of a warm board under their heels. By the
time I was twenty years old, I really suppose I had raised more poultry
than any one individual in all the section round about there. The very
chickens came to know my talent by and by. The youth of both sexes
ceased to paw the earth for worms, and old roosters that came to crow,
“remained to pray,“ when I passed by.</p>
<p>I have had so much experience in the raising of fowls that I cannot
but think that a few hints from me might be useful to the society. The
two methods I have already touched upon are very simple, and are only
used in the raising of the commonest class of fowls; one is for summer,
the other for winter. In the one case you start out with a friend along
about eleven o’clock’ on a summer’s night (not later, because in some
states –especially in California and Oregon–chickens always rouse up
just at midnight and crow from ten to thirty minutes, according to the
ease or difficulty they experience in getting the public waked up), and
your friend carries with him a sack. Arrived at the henroost (your
neighbor’s, not your own), you light a match and hold it under first one
and then another pullet’s nose until they are willing to go into that
bag without making any trouble about it. You then return home, either
taking the bag with you or leaving it behind, according as circumstances
shall dictate. N. B.–I have seen the time when it was eligible and
appropriate to leave the sack behind and walk off with considerable
velocity, without ever leaving any word where to send it.</p>
<p>In the case of the other method mentioned for raising poultry, your
friend takes along a covered vessel with a charcoal fire in it, and you
carry a long slender plank. This is a frosty night, understand. Arrived
at the tree, or fence, or other henroost (your own if you are an idiot),
you warm the end of your plank in your friend’s fire vessel, and then
raise it aloft and ease it up gently against a slumbering chicken’s
foot. If the subject of your attentions is a true bird, he will
infallibly return thanks with a sleepy cluck or two, and step out and
take up quarters on the plank, thus becoming so conspicuously accessory
before the fact to his own murder as to make it a grave question in our
minds as it once was in the mind of Blackstone, whether he is not really
and deliberately, committing suicide in the second degree. [But you
enter into a contemplation of these legal refinements subsequently not
then.]</p>
<p>When you wish to raise a fine, large, donkey voiced Shanghai rooster,
you do it with a lasso, just as you would a bull. It is because he must
choked, and choked effectually, too. It is the only good, certain way,
for whenever he mentions a matter which he is cordially interested in,
the chances are ninety-nine in a hundred that he secures somebody else’s
immediate attention to it too, whether it day or night.</p>
<p>The Black Spanish is an exceedingly fine bird and a costly one.
Thirty-five dollars is the usual figure and fifty a not uncommon price
for a specimen. Even its eggs are worth from a dollar to a dollar and a
half apiece, and yet are so unwholesome that the city physician seldom
or never orders them for the workhouse. Still I have once or twice
procured as high as a dozen at a time for nothing, in the dark of the
moon. The best way to raise the Black Spanish fowl is to go late in the
evening and raise coop and all. The reason I recommend this method is
that, the birds being so valuable, the owners do not permit them to
roost around promiscuously, they put them in a coop as strong as a
fireproof safe and keep it in the kitchen at night. The method I speak
of is not always a bright and satisfying success, and yet there are so
many little articles of vertu about a kitchen, that if you fail on the
coop you can generally bring away something else. I brought away a nice
steel trap one night, worth ninety cents.</p>
<p>But what is the use in my pouring out my whole intellect on this
subject? I have shown the Western New York Poultry Society that they
have taken to their bosom a party who is not a spring chicken by any
means, but a man who knows all about poultry, and is just as high up in
the most efficient methods of raising it as the president of the
institution himself. I thank these gentlemen for the honorary membership
they have conferred upon me, and shall stand at all times ready and
willing to testify my good feeling and my official zeal by deeds as well
as by this hastily penned advice and information. Whenever they are
ready to go to raising poultry, let them call for me any evening after
eleven o’clock.</p>
<p>EXPERIENCE OF THE McWILLIAMSES WITH MEMBRANOUS CROUP</p>
<p>[As related to the author of this book by Mr. McWilliams, a pleasant
New York gentleman whom the said author met by chance on a journey.]</p>
<p>Well, to go back to where I was before I digressed to explain to you
how that frightful and incurable disease, membranous croup,[Diphtheria
D.W.] was ravaging the town and driving all mothers mad with terror, I
called Mrs. McWilliams’s attention to little Penelope, and said:</p>
<p>“Darling, I wouldn’t let that child be chewing that pine stick if I
were you.“</p>
<p>“Precious, where is the harm in it?“ said she, but at the same time
preparing to take away the stick for women cannot receive even the most
palpably judicious suggestion without arguing it, that is married
women.</p>
<p>I replied:</p>
<p>“Love, it is notorious that pine is the least nutritious wood that a
child can eat.“</p>
<p>My wife’s hand paused, in the act of taking the stick, and returned
itself to her lap. She bridled perceptibly, and said:</p>
<p>“Hubby, you know better than that. You know you do. Doctors all say
that the turpentine in pine wood is good for weak back and the
kidneys.“</p>
<p>“Ah–I was under a misapprehension. I did not know that the child’s
kidneys and spine were affected, and that the family physician had
recommended–“</p>
<p>“Who said the child’s spine and kidneys were affected?“</p>
<p>“My love, you intimated it.“</p>
<p>“The idea! I never intimated anything of the kind.“</p>
<p>“Why, my dear, it hasn’t been two minutes since you said–“</p>
<p>“Bother what I said! I don’t care what I did say. There isn’t any
harm in the child’s chewing a bit of pine stick if she wants to, and you
know it perfectly well. And she shall chew it, too. So there, now!“</p>
<p>“Say no more, my dear. I now see the force of your reasoning, and I
will go and order two or three cords of the best pine wood to-day. No
child of mine shall want while I–“</p>
<p>“Oh, please go along to your office and let me have some peace. A
body can never make the simplest remark but you must take it up and go
to arguing and arguing and arguing till you don’t know what you are
talking about, and you never do.“</p>
<p>“Very well, it shall be as you say. But there is a want of logic in
your last remark which–“</p>
<p>However, she was gone with a flourish before I could finish, and had
taken the child with her. That night at dinner she confronted me with a
face a white as a sheet:</p>
<p>“Oh, Mortimer, there’s another! Little Georgi Gordon is taken.“</p>
<p>“Membranous croup?“</p>
<p>“Membranous croup.“</p>
<p>“Is there any hope for him?“</p>
<p>“None in the wide world. Oh, what is to be come of us!“</p>
<p>By and by a nurse brought in our Penelope to say good night and offer
the customary prayer at the mother’s knee. In the midst of “Now I lay me
down to sleep,“ she gave a slight cough! My wife fell back like one
stricken with death. But the next moment she was up and brimming with
the activities which terror inspires.</p>
<p>She commanded that the child’s crib be removed from the nursery to
our bedroom; and she went along to see the order executed. She took me
with her, of course. We got matters arranged with speed. A cot-bed was
put up in my wife’s dressing room for the nurse. But now Mrs. McWilliams
said we were too far away from the other baby, and what if he were to
have the symptoms in the night–and she blanched again, poor thing.</p>
<p>We then restored the crib and the nurse to the nursery and put up a
bed for ourselves in a room adjoining.</p>
<p>Presently, however, Mrs. McWilliams said suppose the baby should
catch it from Penelope? This thought struck a new panic to her heart,
and the tribe of us could not get the crib out of the nursery again fast
enough to satisfy my wife, though she assisted in her own person and
well-nigh pulled the crib to pieces in her frantic hurry.</p>
<p>We moved down-stairs; but there was no place there to stow the nurse,
and Mrs. McWilliams said the nurse’s experience would be an inestimable
help. So we returned, bag and baggage, to our own bedroom once more, and
felt a great gladness, like storm-buffeted birds that have found their
nest again.</p>
<p>Mrs. McWilliams sped to the nursery to see how things were going on
there. She was back in a moment with a new dread. She said:</p>
<p>“What can make Baby sleep so?“</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>“Why, my darling, Baby always sleeps like a graven image.“</p>
<p>“I know. I know; but there’s something peculiar about his sleep now.
He seems to–to–he seems to breathe so regularly. Oh, this is
dreadful.“</p>
<p>“But, my dear, he always breathes regularly.“</p>
<p>“Oh, I know it, but there’s something frightful about it now. His
nurse is too young and inexperienced. Maria shall stay there with her,
and be on hand if anything happens.“</p>
<p>“That is a good idea, but who will help you?“</p>
<p>“You can help me all I want. I wouldn’t allow anybody to do anything
but myself, anyhow, at such a time as this.“</p>
<p>I said I would feel mean to lie abed and sleep, and leave her to
watch and toil over our little patient all the weary night. But she
reconciled me to it. So old Maria departed and took up her ancient
quarters in the nursery.</p>
<p>Penelope coughed twice in her sleep.</p>
<p>“Oh, why don’t that doctor come! Mortimer, this room is too warm.
This room is certainly too warm. Turn off the register-quick!“</p>
<p>I shut it off, glancing at the thermometer at the same time, and
wondering to myself if 70 was too warm for a sick child.</p>
<p>The coachman arrived from down-town now with the news that our
physician was ill and confined to his bed. Mrs. McWilliams turned a dead
eye upon me, and said in a dead voice:</p>
<p>“There is a Providence in it. It is foreordained. He never was sick
before. Never. We have not been living as we ought to live, Mortimer.
Time and time again I have told you so. Now you see the result. Our
child will never get well. Be thankful if you can forgive yourself; I
never can forgive myself.“</p>
<p>I said, without intent to hurt, but with heedless choice of words,
that I could not see that we had been living such an abandoned life.</p>
<p>“Mortimer! Do you want to bring the judgment upon Baby, too!“</p>
<p>Then she began to cry, but suddenly exclaimed:</p>
<p>“The doctor must have sent medicines!“</p>
<p>I said:</p>
<p>“Certainly. They are here. I was only waiting for you to give me a
chance.“</p>
<p>“Well do give them to me! Don’t you know that every moment is
precious now? But what was the use in sending medicines, when he knows
that the disease is incurable?“</p>
<p>I said that while there was life there was hope.</p>
<p>“Hope! Mortimer, you know no more what you are talking about than the
child unborn. If you would–As I live, the directions say give one
teaspoonful once an hour! Once an hour!–as if we had a whole year before
us to save the child in! Mortimer, please hurry. Give the poor perishing
thing a tablespoonful, and try to be quick!“</p>
<p>“Why, my dear, a tablespoonful might–“</p>
<p>“Don’t drive me frantic! . . . There, there, there, my precious, my
own; it’s nasty bitter stuff, but it’s good for Nelly–good for mother’s
precious darling; and it will make her well. There, there, there, put
the little head on mamma’s breast and go to sleep, and pretty soon–oh, I
know she can’t live till morning! Mortimer, a tablespoonful every
half-hour will–Oh, the child needs belladonna, too; I know she does–and
aconite. Get them, Mortimer. Now do let me have my way. You know nothing
about these things.“</p>
<p>We now went to bed, placing the crib close to my wife’s pillow. All
this turmoil had worn upon me, and within two minutes I was something
more than half asleep. Mrs. McWilliams roused me:</p>
<p>“Darling, is that register turned on?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“I thought as much. Please turn it on at once. This room is
cold.“</p>
<p>I turned it on, and presently fell asleep again. I was aroused once
more:</p>
<p>“Dearie, would you mind moving the crib to your side of the bed? It
is nearer the register.“</p>
<p>I moved it, but had a collision with the rug and woke up the child. I
dozed off once more, while my wife quieted the sufferer. But in a little
while these words came murmuring remotely through the fog of my
drowsiness:</p>
<p>“Mortimer, if we only had some goose grease–will you ring?“</p>
<p>I climbed dreamily out, and stepped on a cat, which responded with a
protest and would have got a convincing kick for it if a chair had not
got it instead.</p>
<p>“Now, Mortimer, why do you want to turn up the gas and wake up the
child again?“</p>
<p>“Because I want to see how much I am hurt, Caroline.“</p>
<p>“Well, look at the chair, too–I have no doubt it is ruined. Poor cat,
suppose you had–“</p>
<p>“Now I am not going to suppose anything about the cat. It never would
have occurred if Maria had been allowed to remain here and attend to
these duties, which are in her line and are not in mine.“</p>
<p>“Now, Mortimer, I should think you would be ashamed to make a remark
like that. It is a pity if you cannot do the few little things I ask of
you at such an awful time as this when our child–“</p>
<p>“There, there, I will do anything you want. But I can’t raise anybody
with this bell. They’re all gone to bed. Where is the goose grease?“</p>
<p>“On the mantelpiece in the nursery. If you’ll step there and speak to
Maria–“</p>
<p>I fetched the goose grease and went to sleep again. Once more I was
called:</p>
<p>“Mortimer, I so hate to disturb you, but the room is still too cold
for me to try to apply this stuff. Would you mind lighting the fire? It
is all ready to touch a match to.“</p>
<p>I dragged myself out and lit the fire, and then sat down
disconsolate.</p>
<p>“Mortimer, don’t sit there and catch your death of cold. Come to
bed.“</p>
<p>As I was stepping in she said:</p>
<p>“But wait a moment. Please give the child some more of the
medicine.“</p>
<p>Which I did. It was a medicine which made a child more or less
lively; so my wife made use of its waking interval to strip it and
grease it all over with the goose oil. I was soon asleep once more, but
once more I had to get up.</p>
<p>“Mortimer, I feel a draft. I feel it distinctly. There is nothing so
bad for this disease as a draft. Please move the crib in front of the
fire.“</p>
<p>I did it; and collided with the rug again, which I threw in the fire.
Mrs. McWilliams sprang out of bed and rescued it and we had some words.
I had another trifling interval of sleep, and then got up, by request,
and constructed a flax-seed poultice. This was placed upon the child’s
breast and left there to do its healing work.</p>
<p>A wood-fire is not a permanent thing. I got up every twenty minutes
and renewed ours, and this gave Mrs. McWilliams the opportunity to
shorten the times of giving the medicines by ten minutes, which was a
great satisfaction to her. Now and then, between times, I reorganized
the flax-seed poultices, and applied sinapisms and other sorts of
blisters where unoccupied places could be found upon the child. Well,
toward morning the wood gave out and my wife wanted me to go down cellar
and get some more. I said:</p>
<p>“My dear, it is a laborious job, and the child must be nearly warm
enough, with her extra clothing. Now mightn’t we put on another layer of
poultices and–“</p>
<p>I did not finish, because I was interrupted. I lugged wood up from
below for some little time, and then turned in and fell to snoring as
only a man can whose strength is all gone and whose soul is worn out.
Just at broad daylight I felt a grip on my shoulder that brought me to
my senses suddenly. My wife was glaring down upon me and gasping. As
soon as she could command her tongue she said:</p>
<p>“It is all over! All over! The child’s perspiring! What shall we
do?“</p>
<p>“Mercy, how you terrify me! I don’t know what we ought to do. Maybe
if we scraped her and put her in the draft again–“</p>
<p>“Oh, idiot! There is not a moment to lose! Go for the doctor. Go
yourself. Tell him he must come, dead or alive.“</p>
<p>I dragged that poor sick man from his bed and brought him. He looked
at the child and said she was not dying. This was joy unspeakable to me,
but it made my wife as mad as if he had offered her a personal affront.
Then he said the child’s cough was only caused by some trifling
irritation or other in the throat. At this I thought my wife had a mind
to show him the door. Now the doctor said he would make the child cough
harder and dislodge the trouble. So he gave her something that sent her
into a spasm of coughing, and presently up came a little wood splinter
or so.</p>
<p>“This child has no membranous croup,“ said he. “She has been chewing
a bit of pine shingle or something of the kind, and got some little
slivers in her throat. They won’t do her any hurt.“</p>
<p>“No,“ said I, “I can well believe that. Indeed, the turpentine that
is in them is very good for certain sorts of diseases that are peculiar
to children. My wife will tell you so.“</p>
<p>But she did not. She turned away in disdain and left the room; and
since that time there is one episode in our life which we never refer
to. Hence the tide of our days flows by in deep and untroubled
serenity.</p>
<p>[Very few married men have such an experience as McWilliams’s, and so
the author of this book thought that maybe the novelty of it would give
it a passing interest to the reader.]</p>
