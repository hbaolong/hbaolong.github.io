<h4 id="chapter-3-all-aflame-with-love-of-france">CHAPTER 3 All Aflame
with Love of France</h4>
<p>SPEAKING of this matter reminds me of many incidents, many things
that I could tell, but I think I will not try to do it now. It will be
more to my present humor to call back a little glimpse of the simple and
colorless good times we used to have in our village homes in those
peaceful days–especially in the winter. In the summer we children were
out on the breezy uplands with the flocks from dawn till night, and then
there was noisy frolicking and all that; but winter was the cozy time,
winter was the snug time. Often we gathered in old Jacques d’Arc’s big
dirt-floored apartment, with a great fire going, and played games, and
sang songs, and told fortunes, and listened to the old villagers tell
tales and histories and lies and one thing and another till twelve
o’clock at night.</p>
<p>One winter’s night we were gathered there–it was the winter that for
years afterward they called the hard winter–and that particular night
was a sharp one. It blew a gale outside, and the screaming of the wind
was a stirring sound, and I think I may say it was beautiful, for I
think it is great and fine and beautiful to hear the wind rage and storm
and blow its clarions like that, when you are inside and comfortable.
And we were. We had a roaring fire, and the pleasant spit-spit of the
snow and sleet falling in it down the chimney, and the yarning and
laughing and singing went on at a noble rate till about ten o’clock, and
then we had a supper of hot porridge and beans, and meal cakes with
butter, and appetites to match.</p>
<p>Little Joan sat on a box apart, and had her bowl and bread on another
one, and her pets around her helping. She had more than was usual of
them or economical, because all the outcast cats came and took up with
her, and homeless or unlovable animals of other kinds heard about it and
came, and these spread the matter to the other creatures, and they came
also; and as the birds and the other timid wild things of the woods were
not afraid of her, but always had an idea she was a friend when they
came across her, and generally struck up an acquaintance with her to get
invited to the house, she always had samples of those breeds in stock.
She was hospitable to them all, for an animal was an animal to her, and
dear by mere reason of being an animal, no matter about its sort or
social station; and as she would allow of no cages, no collars, no
fetters, but left the creatures free to come and go as they liked, that
contented them, and they came; but they didn’t go, to any extent, and so
they were a marvelous nuisance, and made Jacques d’Arc swear a good
deal; but his wife said God gave the child the instinct, and knew what
He was doing when He did it, therefore it must have its course; it would
be no sound prudence to meddle with His affairs when no invitation had
been extended. So the pets were left in peace, and here they were, as I
have said, rabbits, birds, squirrels, cats, and other reptiles, all
around the child, and full of interest in her supper, and helping what
they could. There was a very small squirrel on her shoulder, sitting up,
as those creatures do, and turning a rocky fragment of prehistoric
chestnut-cake over and over in its knotty hands, and hunting for the
less indurated places, and giving its elevated bushy tail a flirt and
its pointed ears a toss when it found one–signifying thankfulness and
surprise–and then it filed that place off with those two slender front
teeth which a squirrel carries for that purpose and not for ornament,
for ornamental they never could be, as any will admit that have noticed
them.</p>
<p>Everything was going fine and breezy and hilarious, but then there
came an interruption, for somebody hammered on the door. It was one of
those ragged road-stragglers–the eternal wars kept the country full of
them. He came in, all over snow, and stamped his feet, and shook, and
brushed himself, and shut the door, and took off his limp ruin of a hat,
and slapped it once or twice against his leg to knock off its fleece of
snow, and then glanced around on the company with a pleased look upon
his thin face, and a most yearning and famished one in his eye when it
fell upon the victuals, and then he gave us a humble and conciliatory
salutation, and said it was a blessed thing to have a fire like that on
such a night, and a roof overhead like this, and that rich food to eat,
and loving friends to talk with–ah, yes, this was true, and God help the
homeless, and such as must trudge the roads in this weather.</p>
<p>Nobody said anything. The embarrassed poor creature stood there and
appealed to one face after the other with his eyes, and found no welcome
in any, the smile on his own face flickering and fading and perishing,
meanwhile; then he dropped his gaze, the muscles of his face began to
twitch, and he put up his hand to cover this womanish sign of
weakness.</p>
<p>“Sit down!“</p>
<p>This thunder-blast was from old Jacques d’Arc, and Joan was the
object of it. The stranger was startled, and took his hand away, and
there was Joan standing before him offering him her bowl of porridge.
The man said:</p>
<p>“God Almighty bless you, my darling!“ and then the tears came, and
ran down his cheeks, but he was afraid to take the bowl.</p>
<p>“Do you hear me? Sit down, I say!“</p>
<p>There could not be a child more easy to persuade than Joan, but this
was not the way. Her father had not the art; neither could he learn it.
Joan said:</p>
<p>“Father, he is hungry; I can see it.“</p>
<p>“Let him work for food, then. We are being eaten out of house and
home by his like, and I have said I would endure it no more, and will
keep my word. He has the face of a rascal anyhow, and a villain. Sit
down, I tell you!“</p>
<p>“I know not if he is a rascal or no, but he is hungry, father, and
shall have my porridge–I do not need it.“</p>
<p>“If you don’t obey me I’ll– Rascals are not entitled to help from
honest people, and no bite nor sup shall they have in this house.
Joan!“</p>
<p>She set her bowl down on the box and came over and stood before her
scowling father, and said:</p>
<p>“Father, if you will not let me, then it must be as you say; but I
would that you would think–then you would see that it is not right to
punish one part of him for what the other part has done; for it is that
poor stranger’s head that does the evil things, but it is not his head
that is hungry, it is his stomach, and it has done no harm to anybody,
but is without blame, and innocent, not having any way to do a wrong,
even if it was minded to it. Please let–“</p>
<p>“What an idea! It is the most idiotic speech I ever heard.“</p>
<p>But Aubrey, the maire, broke in, he being fond of an argument, and
having a pretty gift in that regard, as all acknowledged. Rising in his
place and leaning his knuckles upon the table and looking about him with
easy dignity, after the manner of such as be orators, he began, smooth
and persuasive:</p>
<p>“I will differ with you there, gossip, and will undertake to show the
company“–here he looked around upon us and nodded his head in a
confident way–“that there is a grain of sense in what the child has
said; for look you, it is of a certainty most true and demonstrable that
it is a man’s head that is master and supreme ruler over his whole body.
Is that granted? Will any deny it?“ He glanced around again; everybody
indicated assent. “Very well, then; that being the case, no part of the
body is responsible for the result when it carries out an order
delivered to it by the head; ergo, the head is alone responsible for
crimes done by a man’s hands or feet or stomach–do you get the idea? am
I right thus far?“ Everybody said yes, and said it with enthusiasm, and
some said, one to another, that the maire was in great form to-night and
at his very best–which pleased the maire exceedingly and made his eyes
sparkle with pleasure, for he overheard these things; so he went on in
the same fertile and brilliant way. “Now, then, we will consider what
the term responsibility means, and how it affects the case in point.
Responsibility makes a man responsible for only those things for which
he is properly responsible“–and he waved his spoon around in a wide
sweep to indicate the comprehensive nature of that class of
responsibilities which render people responsible, and several exclaimed,
admiringly, “He is right!–he has put that whole tangled thing into a
nutshell–it is wonderful!“ After a little pause to give the interest
opportunity to gather and grow, he went on: “Very good. Let us suppose
the case of a pair of tongs that falls upon a man’s foot, causing a
cruel hurt. Will you claim that the tongs are punishable for that? The
question is answered; I see by your faces that you would call such a
claim absurd. Now, why is it absurd? It is absurd because, there being
no reasoning faculty–that is to say, no faculty of personal command–in a
pair of togs, personal responsibility for the acts of the tongs is
wholly absent from the tongs; and, therefore, responsibility being
absent, punishment cannot ensue. Am I right?“ A hearty burst of applause
was his answer. “Now, then, we arrive at a man’s stomach. Consider how
exactly, how marvelously, indeed, its situation corresponds to that of a
pair of tongs. Listen–and take careful note, I beg you. Can a man’s
stomach plan a murder? No. Can it plan a theft? No. Can it plan an
incendiary fire? No. Now answer me–can a pair of tongs?“ (There were
admiring shouts of “No!“ and “The cases are just exact!“ and “Don’t he
do it splendid!“) “Now, then, friends and neighbors, a stomach which
cannot plan a crime cannot be a principal in the commission of it–that
is plain, as you see. The matter is narrowed down by that much; we will
narrow it further. Can a stomach, of its own motion, assist at a crime?
The answer is no, because command is absent, the reasoning faculty is
absent, volition is absent–as in the case of the tongs. We perceive now,
do we not, that the stomach is totally irresponsible for crimes
committed, either in whole or in part, by it?“ He got a rousing cheer
for response. “Then what do we arrive at as our verdict? Clearly this:
that there is no such thing in this world as a guilty stomach; that in
the body of the veriest rascal resides a pure and innocent stomach;
that, whatever it’s owner may do, it at least should be sacred in our
eyes; and that while God gives us minds to think just and charitable and
honorable thoughts, it should be, and is, our privilege, as well as our
duty, not only to feed the hungry stomach that resides in a rascal,
having pity for its sorrow and its need, but to do it gladly,
gratefully, in recognition of its sturdy and loyal maintenance of its
purity and innocence in the midst of temptation and in company so
repugnant to its better feelings. I am done.“</p>
<p>Well, you never saw such an effect! They rose–the whole house rose–an
clapped, and cheered, and praised him to the skies; and one after
another, still clapping and shouting, they crowded forward, some with
moisture in their eyes, and wrung his hands, and said such glorious
things to him that he was clear overcome with pride and happiness, and
couldn’t say a word, for his voice would have broken, sure. It was
splendid to see; and everybody said he had never come up to that speech
in his life before, and never could do it again. Eloquence is a power,
there is no question of that. Even old Jacques d’Arc was carried away,
for once in his life, and shouted out:</p>
<p>“It’s all right, Joan–give him the porridge!“</p>
<p>She was embarrassed, and did not seem to know what to say, and so
didn’t say anything. It was because she had given the man the porridge
long ago and he had already eaten it all up. When she was asked why she
had not waited until a decision was arrived at, she said the man’s
stomach was very hungry, and it would not have been wise to wait, since
she could not tell what the decision would be. Now that was a good and
thoughtful idea for a child.</p>
<p>The man was not a rascal at all. He was a very good fellow, only he
was out of luck, and surely that was no crime at that time in France.
Now that his stomach was proved to be innocent, it was allowed to make
itself at home; and as soon as it was well filled and needed nothing
more, the man unwound his tongue and turned it loose, and it was really
a noble one to go. He had been in the wars for years, and the things he
told and the way he told them fired everybody’s patriotism away up high,
and set all hearts to thumping and all pulses to leaping; then, before
anybody rightly knew how the change was made, he was leading us a
sublime march through the ancient glories of France, and in fancy we saw
the titanic forms of the twelve paladins rise out of the mists of the
past and face their fate; we heard the tread of the innumerable hosts
sweeping down to shut them in; we saw this human tide flow and ebb, ebb
and flow, and waste away before that little band of heroes; we saw each
detail pass before us of that most stupendous, most disastrous, yet most
adored and glorious day in French legendary history; here and there and
yonder, across that vast field of the dead and dying, we saw this and
that and the other paladin dealing his prodigious blows with weary arm
and failing strength, and one by one we saw them fall, till only one
remained–he that was without peer, he whose name gives name to the Song
of Songs, the song which no Frenchman can hear and keep his feelings
down and his pride of country cool; then, grandest and pitifulest scene
of all, we saw his own pathetic death; and out stillness, as we sat with
parted lips and breathless, hanging upon this man’s words, gave us a
sense of the awful stillness that reigned in that field of slaughter
when that last surviving soul had passed.</p>
<p>And now, in this solemn hush, the stranger gave Joan a pat or two on
the head and said:</p>
<p>“Little maid–whom God keep!–you have brought me from death to life
this night; now listen: here is your reward,“ and at that supreme time
for such a heart-melting, soul-rousing surprise, without another word he
lifted up the most noble and pathetic voice that was ever heard, and
began to pour out the great Song of Roland!</p>
<p>Think of that, with a French audience all stirred up and ready. Oh,
where was your spoken eloquence now! what was it to this! How fine he
looked, how stately, how inspired, as he stood there with that mighty
chant welling from his lips and his heart, his whole body transfigured,
and his rags along with it.</p>
<p>Everybody rose and stood while he sang, and their faces glowed and
their eyes burned; and the tears came and flowed don their cheeks and
their forms began to sway unconsciously to the swing of the song, and
their bosoms to heave and pant; and moanings broke out, and deep
ejaculations; and when the last verse was reached, and Roland lay dying,
all alone, with his face to the field and to his slain, lying there in
heaps and winrows, and took off and held up his gauntlet to God with his
failing hand, and breathed his beautiful prayer with his paling pips,
all burst out in sobs and wailings. But when the final great note died
out and the song was done, they all flung themselves in a body at the
singer, stark mad with love of him and love of France and pride in her
great deeds and old renown, and smothered him with their embracings; but
Joan was there first, hugged close to his breast, and covering his face
with idolatrous kisses.</p>
<p>The storm raged on outside, but that was no matter; this was the
stranger’s home now, for as long as he might please.</p>
