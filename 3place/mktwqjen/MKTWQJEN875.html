<h4 id="chapter-x.">CHAPTER X.</h4>
<p>We may take that up now.</p>
<p>It is not a single if, but a several-jointed one; not an oyster, but
a vertebrate.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Did Mrs. Eddy borrow from Quimby the Great Idea, or only the
little one, the old-timer, the ordinary mental-healing-healing by
“mortal“ mind?</p></li>
<li><p>If she borrowed the Great Idea, did she carry it away in her
head, or in manuscript?</p></li>
<li><p>Did she hit upon the Great Idea herself? By the Great Idea I
mean, of course, the conviction that the Force involved was still
existent, and could be applied now just as it was applied by Christ’s
Disciples and their converts, and as successfully. 4. Did she
philosophize it, systematize it, and write it down in a book?</p></li>
<li><p>Was it she, and not another, that built a new Religion upon the
book and organized it?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I think No. 5 can be answered with a Yes, and dismissed from the
controversy. And I think that the Great Idea, great as it was, would
have enjoyed but a brief activity, and would then have gone to sleep
again for some more centuries, but for the perpetuating impulse it got
from that organized and tremendous force.</p>
<p>As for Nos. 1, 2, and 4, the hostiles contend that Mrs. Eddy got the
Great Idea from Quimby and carried it off in manuscript. But their
testimony, while of consequence, lacks the most important detail; so far
as my information goes, the Quimby manuscript has not been produced. I
think we cannot discuss No. 1 and No. 2 profitably. Let them go.</p>
<p>For me, No. 3 has a mild interest, and No. 4 a violent one.</p>
<p>As regards No. 3, Mrs. Eddy was brought up, from the cradle, an
old-time, boiler-iron, Westminster-Catechism Christian, and knew her
Bible as well as Captain Kydd knew his, “when he sailed, when he
sailed,“ and perhaps as sympathetically. The Great Idea had struck a
million Bible-readers before her as being possible of resurrection and
application–it must have struck as many as that, and been cogitated,
indolently, doubtingly, then dropped and forgotten–and it could have
struck her, in due course. But how it could interest her, how it could
appeal to her–with her make this a thing that is difficult to
understand.</p>
<p>For the thing back of it is wholly gracious and beautiful: the power,
through loving mercifulness and compassion, to heal fleshly ills and
pains and grief–all–with a word, with a touch of the hand! This power
was given by the Saviour to the Disciples, and to all the converted.
All–every one. It was exercised for generations afterwards. Any
Christian who was in earnest and not a make-believe, not a policy
–Christian, not a Christian for revenue only, had that healing power,
and could cure with it any disease or any hurt or damage possible to
human flesh and bone. These things are true, or they are not. If they
were true seventeen and eighteen and nineteen centuries ago it would be
difficult to satisfactorily explain why or how or by what argument that
power should be nonexistent in Christians now.</p>
<p>To wish to exercise it could occur to Mrs. Eddy–but would it?</p>
<p>Grasping, sordid, penurious, famishing for everything she sees–money,
power, glory–vain, untruthful, jealous, despotic, arrogant, insolent,
pitiless where thinkers and hypnotists are concerned, illiterate,
shallow, incapable of reasoning outside of commercial lines,
immeasurably selfish–</p>
<p>Of course the Great Idea could strike her, we have to grant that, but
why it should interest her is a question which can easily overstrain the
imagination and bring on nervous prostration, or something like that,
and is better left alone by the judicious, it seems to me–</p>
<p>Unless we call to our help the alleged other side of Mrs. Eddy’s make
and character the side which her multitude of followers see, and
sincerely believe in. Fairness requires that their view be stated here.
It is the opposite of the one which I have drawn from Mrs. Eddy’s
history and from her By-laws. To her followers she is this:</p>
<p>Patient, gentle, loving, compassionate, noble hearted, unselfish,
sinless, widely cultured, splendidly equipped mentally, a profound
thinker, an able writer, a divine personage, an inspired messenger whose
acts are dictated from the Throne, and whose every utterance is the
Voice of God.</p>
<p>She has delivered to them a religion which has revolutionized their
lives, banished the glooms that shadowed them, and filled them and
flooded them with sunshine and gladness and peace; a religion which has
no hell; a religion whose heaven is not put off to another time, with a
break and a gulf between, but begins here and now, and melts into
eternity as fancies of the waking day melt into the dreams of sleep.</p>
<p>They believe it is a Christianity that is in the New Testament; that
it has always been there, that in the drift of ages it was lost through
disuse and neglect, and that this benefactor has found it and given it
back to men, turning the night of life into day, its terrors into myths,
its lamentations into songs of emancipation and rejoicing.</p>
<p>There we have Mrs. Eddy as her followers see her. She has lifted them
out of grief and care and doubt and fear, and made their lives
beautiful; she found them wandering forlorn in a wintry wilderness, and
has led them to a tropic paradise like that of which the poet sings:</p>
<p>“O, islands there are on the face of the deep Where the leaves never
fade and the skies never weep.“</p>
<p>To ask them to examine with a microscope the character of such a
benefactor; to ask them to examine it at all; to ask them to look at a
blemish which another person believes he has found in it–well, in their
place could you do it? Would you do it? Wouldn’t you be ashamed to do
it? If a tramp had rescued your child from fire and death, and saved its
mother’s heart from breaking, could you see his rags? Could you smell
his breath? Mrs. Eddy has done more than that for these people.</p>
<p>They are prejudiced witnesses. To the credit of human nature it is
not possible that they should be otherwise. They sincerely believe that
Mrs. Eddy’s character is pure and perfect and beautiful, and her history
without stain or blot or blemish. But that does not settle it. They
sincerely believe she did not borrow the Great Idea from Quimby, but hit
upon it herself. It may be so, and it could be so. Let it go–there is no
way to settle it. They believe she carried away no Quimby manuscripts.
Let that go, too–there is no way to settle it. They believe that she,
and not another, built the Religion upon the book, and organized it. I
believe it, too.</p>
<p>Finally, they believe that she philosophized Christian Science,
explained it, systematized it, and wrote it all out with her own hand in
the book Science and Health.</p>
<p>I am not able to believe that. Let us draw the line there. The known
and undisputed products of her pen are a formidable witness against her.
They do seem to me to prove, quite clearly and conclusively, that
writing, upon even simple subjects, is a difficult labor for her: that
she has never been able to write anything above third-rate English; that
she is weak in the matter of grammar; that she has but a rude and dull
sense of the values of words; that she so lacks in the matter of
literary precision that she can seldom put a thought into words that
express it lucidly to the reader and leave no doubts in his mind as to
whether he has rightly understood or not; that she cannot even draught a
Preface that a person can fully comprehend, nor one which can by any art
be translated into a fully understandable form; that she can seldom
inject into a Preface even single sentences whose meaning is
uncompromisingly clear–yet Prefaces are her specialty, if she has
one.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy’s known and undisputed writings are very limited in bulk;
they exhibit no depth, no analytical quality, no thought above school
composition size, and but juvenile ability in handling thoughts of even
that modest magnitude. She has a fine commercial ability, and could
govern a vast railway system in great style; she could draught a set of
rules that Satan himself would say could not be improved on–for devilish
effectiveness–by his staff; but we know, by our excursions among the
Mother-Church’s By-laws, that their English would discredit the deputy
baggage-smasher. I am quite sure that Mrs. Eddy cannot write well upon
any subject, even a commercial one.</p>
<p>In the very first revision of Science and Health (1883), Mrs. Eddy
wrote a Preface which is an unimpeachable witness that the rest of the
book was written by somebody else. I have put it in the Appendix along
with a page or two taken from the body of the book, and will ask the
reader to compare the labored and lumbering and confused gropings of
this Preface with the easy and flowing and direct English of the other
exhibit, and see if he can believe that the one hand and brain produced
both.</p>
<p>And let him take the Preface apart, sentence by sentence, and
searchingly examine each sentence word by word, and see if he can find
half a dozen sentences whose meanings he is so sure of that he can
rephrase them–in words of his own–and reproduce what he takes to be
those meanings. Money can be lost on this game. I know, for I am the one
that lost it.</p>
<p>Now let the reader turn to the excerpt which I have made from the
chapter on “Prayer“ (last year’s edition of Science and Health), and
compare that wise and sane and elevated and lucid and compact piece of
work with the aforesaid Preface, and with Mrs. Eddy’s poetry concerning
the gymnastic trees, and Minerva’s not yet effete sandals, and the
wreaths imported from Erudition’s bower for the decoration of Plymouth
Rock, and the Plague-spot and Bacilli, and my other exhibits (turn back
to my Chapters I. and II.) from the Autobiography, and finally with the
late Communication concerning me, and see if he thinks anybody’s
affirmation, or anybody’s sworn testimony, or any other testimony of any
imaginable kind would ever be likely to convince him that Mrs. Eddy
wrote that chapter on Prayer.</p>
<p>I do not wish to impose my opinion on any one who will not permit it,
but such as it is I offer it here for what it is worth. I cannot
believe, and I do not believe, that Mrs. Eddy originated any of the
thoughts and reasonings out of which the book Science and Health is
constructed; and I cannot believe, and do not believe that she ever
wrote any part of that book.</p>
<p>I think that if anything in the world stands proven, and well and
solidly proven, by unimpeachable testimony–the treacherous testimony of
her own pen in her known and undisputed literary productions–it is that
Mrs. Eddy is not capable of thinking upon high planes, nor of reasoning
clearly nor writing intelligently upon low ones.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as–in my belief–the very first editions of the book Science
and Health were far above the reach of Mrs. Eddy’s mental and literary
abilities, I think she has from the very beginning been claiming as her
own another person’s book, and wearing as her own property laurels
rightfully belonging to that person–the real author of Science and
Health. And I think the reason–and the only reason–that he has not
protested is because his work was not exposed to print until after he
was safely dead.</p>
<p>That with an eye to business, and by grace of her business talent,
she has restored to the world neglected and abandoned features of the
Christian religion which her thousands of followers find gracious and
blessed and contenting, I recognize and confess; but I am convinced that
every single detail of the work except just that one–the delivery of the
Product to the world–was conceived and performed by another.</p>
<p>APPENDIX A</p>
<p>ORIGINAL FIRST PREFACE TO SCIENCE AND HEALTH</p>
<p>There seems a Christian necessity of learning God’s power and purpose
to heal both mind and body. This thought grew out of our early seeking
Him in all our ways, and a hopeless as singular invalidism that drugs
increased instead of diminished, and hygiene benefited only for a
season. By degrees we have drifted into more spiritual latitudes of
thought, and experimented as we advanced until demonstrating fully the
power of mind over the body. About the year 1862, having heard of a
mesmerist in Portland who was treating the sick by manipulation, we
visited him; he helped us for a time, then we relapsed somewhat. After
his decease, and a severe casualty deemed fatal by skilful physicians,
we discovered that the Principle of all healing and the law that governs
it is God, a divine Principle, and a spiritual not material law, and
regained health.</p>
<p>It was not an individual or mortal mind acting upon another so-called
mind that healed us. It was the glorious truths of Christian Science
that we discovered as we neared that verge of so-called material life
named death; yea, it was the great Shekinah, the spirit of Life, Truth,
and Love illuminating our understanding of the action and might of
Omnipotence! The old gentleman to whom we have referred had some very
advanced views on healing, but he was not avowedly religious neither
scholarly. We interchanged thoughts on the subject of healing the sick.
I restored some patients of his that he failed to heal, and left in his
possession some manuscripts of mine containing corrections of his
desultory pennings, which I am informed at his decease passed into the
hands of a patient of his, now residing in Scotland. He died in 1865 and
left no published works. The only manuscript that we ever held of his,
longer than to correct it, was one of perhaps a dozen pages, most of
which we had composed. He manipulated the sick; hence his ostensible
method of healing was physical instead of mental.</p>
<p>We helped him in the esteem of the public by our writings, but never
knew of his stating orally or in writing that he treated his patients
mentally; never heard him give any directions to that effect; and have
it from one of his patients, who now asserts that he was the founder of
mental healing, that he never revealed to anyone his method. We refer to
these facts simply to refute the calumnies and false claims of our
enemies, that we are preferring dishonest claims to the discovery and
founding at this period of Metaphysical Healing or Christian
Science.</p>
<p>The Science and laws of a purely mental healing and their method of
application through spiritual power alone, else a mental argument
against disease, are our own discovery at this date. True, the Principle
is divine and eternal, but the application of it to heal the sick had
been lost sight of, and required to be again spiritually discerned and
its science discovered, that man might retain it through the
understanding. Since our discovery in 1866 of the divine science of
Christian Healing, we have labored with tongue and pen to found this
system. In this endeavor every obstacle has been thrown in our path that
the envy and revenge of a few disaffected students could devise. The
superstition and ignorance of even this period have not failed to
contribute their mite towards misjudging us, while its Christian
advancement and scientific research have helped sustain our feeble
efforts.</p>
<p>Since our first Edition of Science and Health, published in 1875, two
of the aforesaid students have plagiarized and pirated our works. In the
issues of E. J. A., almost exclusively ours, were thirteen paragraphs,
without credit, taken verbatim from our books.</p>
<p>Not one of our printed works was ever copied or abstracted from the
published or from the unpublished writings of anyone. Throughout our
publications of Metaphysical Healing or Christian Science, when writing
or dictating them, we have given ourselves to contemplation wholly apart
from the observation of the material senses: to look upon a copy would
have distracted our thoughts from the subject before us. We were seldom
able to copy our own compositions, and have employed an amanuensis for
the last six years. Every work that we have had published has been
extemporaneously written; and out of fifty lectures and sermons that we
have delivered the last year, forty-four have been extemporaneous. We
have distributed many of our unpublished manuscripts; loaned to one of
our youngest students, R. K——–y, between three and four hundred pages,
of which we were sole author–giving him liberty to copy but not to
publish them.</p>
<p>Leaning on the sustaining Infinite with loving trust, the trials of
to-day grow brief, and to-morrow is big with blessings.</p>
<p>The wakeful shepherd, tending his flocks, beholds from the mountain’s
top the first faint morning beam ere cometh the risen day. So from
Soul’s loftier summits shines the pale star to prophet-shepherd, and it
traverses night, over to where the young child lies, in cradled
obscurity, that shall waken a world. Over the night of error dawn the
morning beams and guiding star of Truth, and “the wise men“ are led by
it to Science, which repeats the eternal harmony that it reproduced, in
proof of immortality. The time for thinkers has come; and the time for
revolutions, ecclesiastical and civil, must come. Truth, independent of
doctrines or time-honored systems, stands at the threshold of history.
Contentment with the past, or the cold conventionality of custom, may no
longer shut the door on science; though empires fall, “He whose right it
is shall reign.“ Ignorance of God should no longer be the stepping-stone
to faith; understanding Him, “whom to know aright is Life eternal,“ is
the only guaranty of obedience.</p>
<p>This volume may not open a new thought, and make it at once familiar.
It has the sturdy task of a pioneer, to hack away at the tall oaks and
cut the rough granite, leaving future ages to declare what it has done.
We made our first discovery of the adaptation of metaphysics to the
treatment of disease in the winter of 1866; since then we have tested
the Principle on ourselves and others, and never found it to fail to
prove the statements herein made of it. We must learn the science of
Life, to reach the perfection of man. To understand God as the Principle
of all being, and to live in accordance with this Principle, is the
Science of Life. But to reproduce this harmony of being, the error of
personal sense must yield to science, even as the science of music
corrects tones caught from the ear, and gives the sweet concord of
sound. There are many theories of physic and theology, and many calls in
each of their directions for the right way; but we propose to settle the
question of “What is Truth?“ on the ground of proof, and let that method
of healing the sick and establishing Christianity be adopted that is
found to give the most health and to make the best Christians; science
will then have a fair field, in which case we are assured of its triumph
over all opinions and beliefs. Sickness and sin have ever had their
doctors; but the question is, Have they become less because of them? The
longevity of our antediluvians would say, No! and the criminal records
of today utter their voices little in favor of such a conclusion. Not
that we would deny to Caesar the things that are his, but that we ask
for the things that belong to Truth; and safely affirm, from the
demonstrations we have been able to make, that the science of man
understood would have eradicated sin, sickness, and death, in a less
period than six thousand years. We find great difficulties in starting
this work right. Some shockingly false claims are already made to a
metaphysical practice; mesmerism, its very antipodes, is one of them.
Hitherto we have never, in a single instance of our discovery, found the
slightest resemblance between mesmerism and metaphysics. No especial
idiosyncrasy is requisite to acquire a knowledge of metaphysical
healing; spiritual sense is more important to its discernment than the
intellect; and those who would learn this science without a high moral
standard of thought and action, will fail to understand it until they go
up higher. Owing to our explanations constantly vibrating between the
same points, an irksome repetition of words must occur; also the use of
capital letters, genders, and technicalities peculiar to the science.
Variety of language, or beauty of diction, must give place to close
analysis and unembellished thought. “Hoping all things, enduring all
things,“ to do good to our enemies, to bless them that curse us, and to
bear to the sorrowing and the sick consolation and healing, we commit
these pages to posterity.</p>
<p>MARY BAKER G. EDDY.</p>
<p>APPENDIX B</p>
<p>The Gospel narratives bear brief testimony even to the life of our
great Master. His spiritual noumenon and phenomenon, silenced
portraiture. Writers, less wise than the Apostles, essayed in the
Apocryphal New Testament, a legendary and traditional history of the
early life of Jesus. But Saint Paul summarized the character of Jesus as
the model of Christianity, in these words: “Consider Him who endured
such contradictions of sinners against Himself. Who for the joy that was
set before Him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down
at the right hand of the throne of God.“</p>
<p>It may be that the mortal life battle still wages, and must continue
till its involved errors are vanquished by victory-bringing Science; but
this triumph will come! God is over all. He alone is our origin, aim,
and Being. The real man is not of the dust, nor is he ever created
through the flesh; for his father and mother are the one Spirit, and his
brethren are all the children of one parent, the eternal Good.</p>
<p>Any kind of literary composition was excessively difficult for
Mrs. Eddy. She found it grinding hard work to dig out anything to say.
She realized, at the above stage in her life, that with all her trouble
she had not been able to scratch together even material enough for a
child’s Autobiography, and also that what she had secured was in the
main not valuable, not important, considering the age and the fame of
the person she was writing about; and so it occurred to her to attempt,
in that paragraph, to excuse the meagreness and poor quality of the
feast she was spreading, by letting on that she could do ever so much
better if she wanted to, but was under constraint of Divine etiquette.
To feed with more than a few indifferent crumbs a plebeian appetite for
personal details about Personages in her class was not the correct
thing, and she blandly points out that there is Precedent for this
reserve. When Mrs. Eddy tries to be artful–in literature–it is generally
after the manner of the ostrich; and with the ostrich’s luck. Please try
to find the connection between the two paragraphs.–M. T.</p>
<p>APPENDIX C</p>
<p>The following is the spiritual signification of the Lord’s
Prayer:</p>
<p>Principle, eternal and harmonious, Nameless and adorable
Intelligence, Thou art ever present and supreme. And when this supremacy
of Spirit shall appear, the dream of matter will disappear. Give us the
understanding of Truth and Love. And loving we shall learn God, and
Truth will destroy all error. And lead us unto the Life that is Soul,
and deliver us from the errors of sense, sin, sickness, and death, For
God is Life, Truth, and Love for ever. –Science and Health, edition of
1881.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this one is distinctly superior to the one that
was inspired for last year’s edition. It is strange, but to my mind
plain, that inspiring is an art which does not improve with practice.–M.
T.</p>
<p>APPENDIX D</p>
<p>“For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this
mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not
doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith
shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say
unto you, What things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye
receive them, and ye shall have them.</p>
<p>“Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask Him.“
–CHRIST JESUS.</p>
<p>The prayer that reclaims the sinner and heals the sick, is an
absolute faith that all things are possible to God–a spiritual
understanding of Him–an unselfed love. Regardless of what another may
say or think on this subject, I speak from experience. This prayer,
combined with self-sacrifice and toil, is the means whereby God has
enabled me to do what I have done for the religion and health of
mankind.</p>
<p>Thoughts unspoken are not unknown to the divine Mind. Desire is
prayer; and no less can occur from trusting God with our desires, that
they may be moulded and exalted before they take form in audible word,
and in deeds.</p>
<p>What are the motives for prayer? Do we pray to make ourselves better,
or to benefit those that hear us; to enlighten the Infinite, or to be
heard of men? Are we benefited by praying? Yes, the desire which goes
forth hungering after righteousness is blessed of our Father, and it
does not return unto us void.</p>
<p>God is not moved by the breath of praise to do more than He has
already done; nor can the Infinite do less than bestow all good, since
He is unchanging Wisdom and Love. We can do more for ourselves by humble
fervent petitions; but the All-loving does not grant them simply on the
ground of lip-service, for He already knows all.</p>
<p>Prayer cannot change the Science of Being, but it does bring us into
harmony with it. Goodness reaches the demonstration of Truth. A request
that another may work for us never does our work. The habit of pleading
with the divine Mind, as one pleads with a human being, perpetuates the
belief in God as humanly circumscribed–an error which impedes spiritual
growth.</p>
<p>God is Love. Can we ask Him to be more? God is Intelligence. Can we
inform the infinite Mind, or tell Him anything He does not already
comprehend? Do we hope to change perfection? Shall we plead for more at
the open fount, which always pours forth more than we receive? The
unspoken prayer does bring us nearer the Source of all existence and
blessedness.</p>
<p>Asking God to be God is a “vain repetition.“ God is “the same
yesterday, and to-day, and forever“; and He who is immutably right will
do right, without being reminded of His province. The wisdom of man is
not sufficient to warrant him in advising God.</p>
<p>Who would stand before a blackboard, and pray the principle of
mathematics to work out the problem? The rule is already established,
and it is our task to work out the solution. Shall we ask the divine
Principle of all goodness to do His own work? His work is done; and we
have only to avail ourselves of God’s rule, in order to receive the
blessing thereof.</p>
<p>The divine Being must be reflected by man–else man is not the image
and likeness of the patient, tender, and true, the one “altogether
lovely“; but to understand God is the work of eternity, and demands
absolute concentration of thought and energy.</p>
<p>How empty are our conceptions of Deity! We admit theoretically that
God is good, omnipotent, omnipresent, infinite, and then we try to give
information to this infinite Mind; and plead for unmerited pardon, and a
liberal outpouring of benefactions. Are we really grateful for the good
already received? Then we shall avail ourselves of the blessings we
have, and thus be fitted to receive more. Gratitude is much more than a
verbal expression of thanks Action expresses more gratitude than
speech.</p>
<p>If we are ungrateful for Life, Truth, and Love, and yet return thanks
to God for all blessings, we are insincere; and incur the sharp censure
our Master pronounces on hypocrites. In such a case the only acceptable
prayer is to put the finger on the lips and remember our blessings.
While the heart is far from divine Truth and Love, we cannot conceal the
ingratitude of barren lives, for God knoweth all things.</p>
<p>What we most need is the prayer of fervent desire for growth in
grace, expressed in patience, meekness, love, and good deeds. To keep
the commandments of our Master and follow his example, is our proper
debt to Him, and the only worthy evidence of our gratitude for all He
has done. Outward worship is not of itself sufficient to express loyal
and heartfelt gratitude, since He has said: “If ye love Me, keep My
Commandments.“</p>
<p>The habitual struggle to be always good, is unceasing prayer. Its
motives are made manifest in the blessings they bring–which, if not
acknowledged in audible words, attest our worthiness to be made
partakers of Love.</p>
<p>Simply asking that we may love God will never make us love Him; but
the longing to be better and holier–expressed in daily watchfulness, and
in striving to assimilate more of the divine character–this will mould
and fashion us anew, until we awake in His likeness. We reach the
Science of Christianity through demonstration of the divine nature; but
in this wicked world goodness will “be evil spoken of,“ and patience
must work experience.</p>
<p>Audible prayer can never do the works of spiritual understanding,
which regenerates; but silent prayer, watchfulness, and devout
obedience, enable us to follow Jesus’ example. Long prayers,
ecclesiasticism, and creeds, have clipped the divine pinions of Love,
and clad religion in human robes. They materialize worship, hinder the
Spirit, and keep man from demonstrating his power over error.</p>
<p>Sorrow for wrong-doing is but one step towards reform, and the very
easiest step. The next and great step required by Wisdom is the test of
our sincerity–namely, reformation. To this end we are placed under the
stress of circumstances. Temptation bids us repeat the offence, and woe
comes in return for what is done. So it will ever be, till we learn that
there is no discount in the law of justice, and that we must pay “the
uttermost farthing.“ The measure ye mete “shall be measured to you
again,“ and it will be full “and running over.“</p>
<p>Saints and sinners get their full award, but not always in this
world. The followers of Christ drank His cup. Ingratitude and
persecution filled it to the brim; but God pours the riches of His love
into the understanding and affections, giving us strength according to
our day. Sinners flourish “like a green bay-tree“; but, looking farther,
the Psalmist could see their end–namely, the destruction of sin through
suffering.</p>
<p>Prayer is sometimes used, as a confessional to cancel sin. This error
impedes true religion. Sin is forgiven, only as it is destroyed by
Christ-Truth and Life If prayer nourishes the belief that sin is
cancelled, and that man is made better by merely praying, it is an evil.
He grows worse who continues in sin because he thinks himself
forgiven.</p>
<p>An apostle says that the Son of God (Christ) came to “destroy the
works of the devil.“ We should follow our divine Exemplar, and seek the
destruction of all evil works, error and disease included. We cannot
escape the penalty due for sin. The Scriptures say, that if we deny
Christ, “He also will deny us.“</p>
<p>The divine Love corrects and governs man. Men may pardon, but this
divine Principle alone reforms the sinner. God is not separate from the
wisdom He bestows. The talents He gives we must improve. Calling on Him
to forgive our work, badly done or left undone, implies the vain
supposition that we have nothing to do but to ask pardon, and that
afterwards we shall be free to repeat the offence.</p>
<p>To cause suffering, as the result of sin, is the means of destroying
sin. Every supposed pleasure in sin will furnish more than its
equivalent of pain, until belief in material life and sin is destroyed.
To reach heaven, the harmony of Being, we must understand the divine
Principle of Being.</p>
<p>“God is Love.“ More than this we cannot ask; higher we cannot look;
farther we cannot go. To suppose that God forgives or punishes sin,
according as His mercy is sought or unsought, is to misunderstand Love
and make prayer the safety-valve for wrong-doing.</p>
<p>Jesus uncovered and rebuked sin before He cast it out. Of a sick
woman He said that Satan had bound her; and to Peter He said, “Thou art
an offense unto me.“ He came teaching and showing men how to destroy
sin, sickness, and death. He said of the fruitless tree, “It is hewn
down.“</p>
<p>It is believed by many that a certain magistrate, who lived in the
time of Jesus, left this record: “His rebuke is fearful.“ The strong
language of our Master confirms this description.</p>
<p>The only civil sentence which He had for error was, “Get thee behind
Me, Satan.“ Still stronger evidence that Jesus’ reproof was pointed and
pungent is in His own words–showing the necessity for such forcible
utterance, when He cast out devils and healed the sick and sinful. The
relinquishment of error deprives material sense of its false claims.</p>
<p>Audible prayer is impressive; it gives momentary solemnity and
elevation to thought; but does it produce any lasting benefit? Looking
deeply into these things, we find that “a zeal . . . not according to
knowledge,“ gives occasion for reaction unfavorable to spiritual growth,
sober resolve, and wholesome perception of God’s requirements. The
motives for verbal prayer may embrace too much love of applause to
induce or encourage Christian sentiment.</p>
<p>Physical sensation, not Soul, produces material ecstasy, and
emotions. If spiritual sense always guided men at such times, there
would grow out of those ecstatic moments a higher experience and a
better life, with more devout self-abnegation, and purity. A
self-satisfied ventilation of fervent sentiments never makes a
Christian. God is not influenced by man. The “divine ear“ is not an
auditorial nerve. It is the all-hearing and all-knowing Mind, to whom
each want of man is always known, and by whom it will be supplied.</p>
<p>The danger from audible prayer is, that it may lead us into
temptation. By it we may become involuntary hypocrites, uttering desires
which are not real, and consoling ourselves in the midst of sin, with
the recollection that we have prayed over it–or mean to ask forgiveness
at some later day. Hypocrisy is fatal to religion.</p>
<p>A wordy prayer may afford a quiet sense of self-justification, though
it makes the sinner a hypocrite. We never need despair of an honest
heart, but there is little hope for those who only come spasmodically
face to face with their wickedness, and then seek to hide it. Their
prayers are indexes which do not correspond with their character. They
hold secret fellowship with sin; and such externals are spoken of by
Jesus as “like unto whited sepulchres . . . full of all
uncleanness.“</p>
<p>If a man, though apparently fervent and prayerful, is impure, and
therefore insincere, what must be the comment upon him? If he had
reached the loftiness of his prayer, there would be no occasion for such
comment. If we feel the aspiration, humility, gratitude, and love which
our words express–this God accepts; and it is wise not to try to deceive
ourselves or others, for “there is nothing covered that shall not be
revealed.“ Professions and audible prayers are like charity in one
respect–they “cover a multitude of sins.“ Praying for humility, with
whatever fervency of expression, does not always mean a desire for it.
If we turn away from the poor, we are not ready to receive the reward of
Him who blesses the poor. We confess to having a very wicked heart, and
ask that it may be laid bare before us; but do we not already know more
of this heart than we are willing to have our neighbor see?</p>
<p>We ought to examine ourselves, and learn what is the affection and
purpose of the heart; for this alone can show us what we honestly are.
If a friend informs us of a fault, do we listen to the rebuke patiently,
and credit what is said? Do we not rather give thanks that we are “not
as other men?“ During many years the author has been most grateful for
merited rebuke. The sting lies in unmerited censure–in the falsehood
which does no one any good.</p>
<p>The test of all prayer lies in the answer to these questions: Do we
love our neighbor better because of this asking? Do we pursue the old
selfishness, satisfied with having prayed for something better, though
we give no evidence of the sincerity of our requests by living
consistently with our prayer? If selfishness has given place to
kindness, we shall regard our neighbor unselfishly, and bless them that
curse us; but we shall never meet this great duty by simply asking that
it may be done. There is a cross to be taken up, before we can enjoy the
fruition of our hope and faith.</p>
<p>Dost thou “love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy mind?“ This command includes much–even the
surrender of all merely material sensation, affection, and worship. This
is the El Dorado of Christianity. It involves the Science of Life, and
recognizes only the divine control of Spirit, wherein Soul is our
master, and material sense and human will have no place.</p>
<p>Are you willing to leave all for Christ, for Truth, and so be counted
among sinners? No! Do you really desire to attain this point? No! Then
why make long prayers about it, and ask to be Christians, since you care
not to tread in the footsteps of our dear Master? If unwilling to follow
His example, wherefore pray with the lips that you may be partakers of
His nature? Consistent prayer is the desire to do right. Prayer means
that we desire to, and will, walk in the light so far as we receive it,
even though with bleeding footsteps, and waiting patiently on the Lord,
will leave our real desires to be rewarded by Him.</p>
<p>The world must grow to the spiritual understanding of prayer. If good
enough to profit by Jesus’ cup of earthly sorrows, God will sustain us
under these sorrows. Until we are thus divinely qualified, and willing
to drink His cup, millions of vain repetitions will never pour into
prayer the unction of Spirit, in demonstration of power, and “with signs
following.“ Christian Science reveals a necessity for overcoming the
world, the flesh and evil, and thus destroying all error.</p>
<p>Seeking is not sufficient. It is striving which enables us to enter.
Spiritual attainments open the door to a higher understanding of the
divine Life.</p>
<p>One of the forms of worship in Thibet is to carry a praying-machine
through the streets, and stop at the doors to earn a penny by grinding
out a prayer; whereas civilization pays for clerical prayers, in lofty
edifices. Is the difference very great, after all?</p>
<p>Experience teaches us that we do not always receive the blessings we
ask for in prayer.</p>
<p>There is some misapprehension of the source and means of all goodness
and blessedness, or we should certainly receive what we ask for. The
Scriptures say: “Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye
may consume it upon your lusts.“ What we desire and ask for it is not
always best for us to receive. In this case infinite Love will not grant
the request. Do you ask Wisdom to be merciful and not punish sin? Then
“ye ask amiss.“ Without punishment, sin would multiply. Jesus’ prayer,
“forgive us our debts,“ specified also the terms of forgiveness. When
forgiving the adulterous woman He said, “Go, and sin no more.“</p>
<p>A magistrate sometimes remits the penalty, but this may be no moral
benefit to the criminal; and at best, it only saves him from one form of
punishment. The moral law, which has the right to acquit or condemn,
always demands restitution, before mortals can “go up higher.“ Broken
law brings penalty, in order to compel this progress.</p>
<p>Mere legal pardon (and there is no other, for divine Principle never
pardons our sins or mistakes till they are corrected) leaves the
offender free to repeat the offense; if, indeed, he has not already
suffered sufficiently from vice to make him turn from it with loathing.
Truth bestows no pardon upon error, but wipes it out in the most
effectual manner. Jesus suffered for our sins, not to annul the divine
sentence against an individual’s sin, but to show that sin must bring
inevitable suffering.</p>
<p>Petitions only bring to mortals the results of their own faith. We
know that a desire for holiness is requisite in order to gain it; but if
we desire holiness above all else, we shall sacrifice everything for it.
We must be willing to do this, that we may walk securely in the only
practical road to holiness. Prayer alone cannot change the unalterable
Truth, or give us an understanding of it; but prayer coupled with a
fervent habitual desire to know and do the will of God will bring us
into all Truth. Such a desire has little need of audible expression. It
is best expressed in thought and life.</p>
<p>APPENDIX E</p>
<p>Reverend Heber Newton on Christian Science:</p>
<p>To begin, then, at the beginning, Christian Science accepts the work
of healing sickness as an integral part of the discipleship of Jesus
Christ. In Christ it finds, what the Church has always recognized,
theoretically, though it has practically ignored the fact–the Great
Physician. That Christ healed the sick, we none of us question. It
stands plainly upon the record. This ministry of healing was too large a
part of His work to be left out from any picture of that life. Such
service was not an incident of His career–it was an essential element of
that career. It was an integral factor in His mission. The Evangelists
leave us no possibility of confusion on this point. Co-equal with his
work of instruction and inspiration was His work of healing.</p>
<p>The records make it equally clear that the Master laid His charge
upon His disciples to do as He had done. “When He had called unto Him
His twelve disciples, He gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast
them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.“
In sending them forth, “He commanded them, saying, . . . As ye go,
preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse
the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons.“</p>
<p>That the twelve disciples undertook to do the Master’s work of
healing, and that they, in their measure, succeeded, seems beyond
question. They found in themselves the same power that the Master found
in Himself, and they used it as He had used His power. The record of The
Acts of the Apostles, if at all trustworthy history, shows that they,
too, healed the sick.</p>
<p>Beyond the circle of the original twelve, it is equally clear that
the early disciples believed themselves charged with the same mission,
and that they sought to fulfil it. The records of the early Church make
it indisputable that powers of healing were recognized as among the
gifts of the Spirit. St. Paul’s letters render it certain that these
gifts were not a privilege of the original twelve, merely, but that they
were the heritage into which all the disciples entered.</p>
<p>Beyond the era of the primitive Church, through several generations,
the early Christians felt themselves called to the same ministry of
healing, and enabled with the same secret of power. Through wellnigh
three centuries, the gifts of healing appear to have been, more or less,
recognized and exercised in the Church. Through those generations,
however, there was a gradual disuse of this power, following upon a
failing recognition of its possession. That which was originally the
rule became the exception. By degrees, the sense of authority and power
to heal passed out from the consciousness of the Church. It ceased to be
a sign of the indwelling Spirit. For fifteen centuries, the recognition
of this authority and power has been altogether exceptional. Here and
there, through the history of these centuries, there have been those who
have entered into this belief of their own privilege and duty, and have
used the gift which they recognized. The Church has never been left
without a line of witnesses to this aspect of the discipleship of
Christ. But she has come to accept it as the normal order of things that
what was once the rule in the Christian Church should be now only the
exception. Orthodoxy has framed a theory of the words of Jesus to
account for this strange departure of His Church from them. It teaches
us to believe that His example was not meant to be followed, in this
respect, by all His disciples. The power of healing which was in Him was
a purely exceptional power. It was used as an evidence of His divine
mission. It was a miraculous gift. The gift of working miracles was not
bestowed upon His Church at large. His original disciples, the twelve
apostles, received this gift, as a necessity of the critical epoch of
Christianity –the founding of the Church. Traces of the power lingered
on, in weakening activity, until they gradually ceased, and the normal
condition of the Church was entered upon, in which miracles are no
longer possible.</p>
<p>We accept this, unconsciously, as the true state of things in
Christianity. But it is a conception which will not bear a moment’s
examination. There is not the slightest suggestion upon record that
Christ set any limit to this charge which He gave His disciples. On the
contrary, there are not lacking hints that He looked for the possession
and exercise of this power wherever His spirit breathed in men.</p>
<p>Even if the concluding paragraph of St. Mark’s Gospel were a later
appendix, it may none the less have been a faithful echo of words of the
Master, as it certainly is a trustworthy record of the belief of the
early Christians as to the thought of Jesus concerning His followers. In
that interesting passage, Jesus, after His death, appeared to the
eleven, and formally commissioned them, again, to take up His work in
the world; bidding them, “Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel
to every creature.“ “And these signs,“ He tells them, “shall follow them
that believe“–not the apostles only, but “them that believe,“ without
limit of time; “in My name they shall cast out devils . . . they shall
lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.“ The concluding discourse
to the disciples, recorded in the Gospel according to St. John, affirms
the same expectation on the part of Jesus; emphasizing it in His solemn
way: “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on Me, the works
that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he
do.“</p>
<p>APPENDIX F</p>
<p>Few will deny that an intelligence apart from man formed and governs
the spiritual universe and man; and this intelligence is the eternal
Mind, and neither matter nor man created this intelligence and divine
Principle; nor can this Principle produce aught unlike itself. All that
we term sin, sickness, and death is comprised in the belief of matter.
The realm of the real is spiritual; the opposite of Spirit is matter;
and the opposite of the real is unreal or material. Matter is an error
of statement, for there is no matter. This error of premises leads to
error of conclusion in every statement of matter as a basis. Nothing we
can say or believe regarding matter is true, except that matter is
unreal, simply a belief that has its beginning and ending.</p>
<p>The conservative firm called matter and mind God never formed. The
unerring and eternal Mind destroys this imaginary copartnership, formed
only to be dissolved in a manner and at a period unknown. This
copartnership is obsolete. Placed under the microscope of metaphysics
matter disappears. Only by understanding there are not two, matter and
mind, is a logical and correct conclusion obtained by either one.
Science gathers not grapes of thorns or figs of thistles. Intelligence
never produced non-intelligence, such as matter: the immortal never
produced mortality, good never resulted in evil. The science of Mind
shows conclusively that matter is a myth. Metaphysics are above physics,
and drag not matter, or what is termed that, into one of its premises or
conclusions. Metaphysics resolves things into thoughts, and exchanges
the objects of sense for the ideas of Soul. These ideas are perfectly
tangible and real to consciousness, and they have this advantage–they
are eternal. Mind and its thoughts comprise the whole of God, the
universe, and of man. Reason and revelation coincide with this
statement, and support its proof every hour, for nothing is harmonious
or eternal that is not spiritual: the realization of this will bring out
objects from a higher source of thought; hence more beautiful and
immortal.</p>
<p>The fact of spiritualization produces results in striking contrast to
the farce of materialization: the one produces the results of chastity
and purity, the other the downward tendencies and earthward gravitation
of sensualism and impurity.</p>
<p>The exalting and healing effects of metaphysics show their fountain.
Nothing in pathology has exceeded the application of metaphysics.
Through mind alone we have prevented disease and preserved health. In
cases of chronic and acute diseases, in their severest forms, we have
changed the secretions, renewed structure, and restored health; have
elongated shortened limbs, relaxed rigid muscles, made cicatrized joints
supple; restored carious bones to healthy conditions, renewed that which
is termed the lost substance of the lungs; and restored healthy
organizations where disease was organic instead of functional.</p>
<p>MRS. EDDY IN ERROR</p>
<p>I feel almost sure that Mrs. Eddy’s inspiration–works are getting out
of repair. I think so because they made some errors in a statement which
she uttered through the press on the 17th of January. Not large ones,
perhaps, still it is a friend’s duty to straighten such things out and
get them right when he can. Therefore I will put my other duties aside
for a moment and undertake this helpful service. She said as
follows:</p>
<p>“In view of the circulation of certain criticisms from the pen of
Mark Twain, I submit the following statement:</p>
<p>“It is a fact, well understood, that I begged the students who first
gave me the endearing appellative ‘mother’ not to name me thus. But,
without my consent, that word spread like wildfire. I still must think
the name is not applicable to me. I stand in relation to this century as
a Christian discoverer, founder, and leader. I regard self-deification
as blasphemous; I may be more loved, but I am less lauded, pampered,
provided for, and cheered than others before me–and wherefore? Because
Christian Science is not yet popular, and I refuse adulation.</p>
<p>“My visit to the Mother-Church after it was built and dedicated
pleased me, and the situation was satisfactory. The dear members wanted
to greet me with escort and the ringing of bells, but I declined, and
went alone in my carriage to the church, entered it, and knelt in thanks
upon the steps of its altar. There the foresplendor of the beginnings of
truth fell mysteriously upon my spirit. I believe in one Christ, teach
one Christ, know of but one Christ. I believe in but one incarnation,
one Mother Mary, and know I am not that one, and never claimed to be. It
suffices me to learn the Science of the Scriptures relative to this
subject.</p>
<p>“Christian Scientists have no quarrel with Protestants, Catholics, or
any other sect. They need to be understood as following the divine
Principle God, Love and not imagined to be unscientific worshippers of a
human being.</p>
<p>“In the aforesaid article, of which I have seen only extracts, Mark
Twain’s wit was not wasted In certain directions. Christian Science
eschews divine rights in human beings. If the individual governed human
consciousness, my statement of Christian Science would be disproved, but
to understand the spiritual idea is essential to demonstrate Science and
its pure monotheism–one God, one Christ, no idolatry, no human
propaganda. Jesus taught and proved that what feeds a few feeds all. His
life-work subordinated the material to the spiritual, and He left this
legacy of truth to mankind. His metaphysics is not the sport of
philosophy, religion, or Science; rather it is the pith and finale of
them all.</p>
<p>“I have not the inspiration or aspiration to be a first or second
Virgin-Mother–her duplicate, antecedent, or subsequent. What I am
remains to be proved by the good I do. We need much humility, wisdom,
and love to perform the functions of foreshadowing and foretasting
heaven within us. This glory is molten in the furnace of
affliction.“</p>
<p>She still thinks the name of Our Mother not applicable to her; and
she is also able to remember that it distressed her when it was
conferred upon her, and that she begged to have it suppressed. Her
memory is at fault here. If she will take her By-laws, and refer to
Section 1 of Article XXII., written with her own hand–she will find that
she has reserved that title to herself, and is so pleased with it, and
so–may we say jealous?–about it, that she threatens with excommunication
any sister Scientist who shall call herself by it. This is that Section
1:</p>
<p>“The Title of Mother. In the year 1895 loyal Christian Scientists had
given to the author of their text-book, the Founder of Christian
Science, the individual, endearing term of Mother. Therefore, if a
student of Christian Science shall apply this title, either to herself
or to others, except as the term for kinship according to the flesh, it
shall be regarded by the Church as an indication of disrespect for their
Pastor Emeritus, and unfitness to be a member of the Mother-Church.“</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is herself the Mother-Church–its powers and authorities are
in her possession solely–and she can abolish that title whenever it may
please her to do so. She has only to command her people, wherever they
may be in the earth, to use it no more, and it will never be uttered
again. She is aware of this.</p>
<p>It may be that she “refuses adulation“ when she is not awake, but
when she is awake she encourages it and propagates it in that museum
called “Our Mother’s Room,“ in her Church in Boston. She could abolish
that institution with a word, if she wanted to. She is aware of that. I
will say a further word about the museum presently.</p>
<p>Further down the column, her memory is unfaithful again:</p>
<p>“I believe in . . . but one Mother Mary, and know I am not that one,
and never claimed to be.“</p>
<p>At a session of the National Christian Science Association, held in
the city of New York on the 27th of May, 1890, the secretary was
“instructed to send to our Mother greetings and words of affection from
her assembled children.“</p>
<p>Her telegraphic response was read to the Association at next day’s
meeting:</p>
<p>“All hail! He hath filled the hungry with good things and the sick
hath He not sent empty away.–MOTHER MARY.“</p>
<p>Which Mother Mary is this one? Are there two? If so, she is both of
them; for, when she signed this telegram in this satisfied and
unprotesting way, the Mother-title which she was going to so strenuously
object to, and put from her with humility, and seize with both hands,
and reserve as her sole property, and protect her monopoly of it with a
stern By-law, while recognizing with diffidence that it was “not
applicable“ to her (then and to-day)–that Mother–title was not yet born,
and would not be offered to her until five years later. The date of the
above “Mother Mary“ is 1890; the “individual, endearing title of Mother“
was given her “in 1895“–according to her own testimony. See her By-law
quoted above.</p>
<p>In his opening Address to that Convention of 1890, the President
recognized this Mary–our Mary-and abolished all previous ones. He
said:</p>
<p>“There is but one Moses, one Jesus; and there is but one Mary.“</p>
<p>The confusions being now dispersed, we have this clarified
result:</p>
<p>Were had been a Moses at one time, and only one; there had been a
Jesus at one time, and only one; there is a Mary and “only one.“ She is
not a Has Been, she is an Is–the “Author of Science and Health; and we
cannot ignore her.“</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In 1890, there was but one Mother Mary. The President said so. 2.
Mrs. Eddy was that one. She said so, in signing the telegram. 3.
Mrs. Eddy was not that one for she says so, in her Associated Press
utterance of January 17th. 4. And has “never claimed to be that
one“–unless the signature to the telegram is a claim.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus it stands proven and established that she is that Mary and
isn’t, and thought she was and knows she wasn’t. That much is clear.</p>
<p>She is also “The Mother,“ by the election of 1895, and did not want
the title, and thinks it is not applicable to her, end will
excommunicate any one that tries to take it away from her. So that is
clear.</p>
<p>I think that the only really troublesome confusion connected with
these particular matters has arisen from the name Mary. Much vexation,
much misunderstanding, could have been avoided if Mrs. Eddy had used
some of her other names in place of that one. “Mother Mary“ was certain
to stir up discussion. It would have been much better if she had signed
the telegram “Mother Baker“; then there would have been no Biblical
competition, and, of course, that is a thing to avoid. But it is not too
late, yet.</p>
<p>I wish to break in here with a parenthesis, and then take up this
examination of Mrs. Eddy’s Claim of January 17th again.</p>
<p>The history of her “Mother Mary“ telegram–as told to me by one who
ought to be a very good authority–is curious and interesting. The
telegram ostensibly quotes verse 53 from the “Magnificat,“ but really
makes some pretty formidable changes in it. This is St. Luke’s
version:</p>
<p>“He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He hath
sent empty away.“</p>
<p>This is “Mother Mary’s“ telegraphed version:</p>
<p>“He hath filled the hungry with good things, and the sick hath He not
sent empty away.“</p>
<p>To judge by the Official Report, the bursting of this bombshell in
that massed convention of trained Christians created no astonishment,
since it caused no remark, and the business of the convention went
tranquilly on, thereafter, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Did those people detect those changes? We cannot know. I think they
must have noticed them, the wording of St. Luke’s verse being as
familiar to all Christians as is the wording of the Beatitudes; and I
think that the reason the new version provoked no surprise and no
comment was, that the assemblage took it for a “Key“–a spiritualized
explanation of verse 53, newly sent down from heaven through Mrs. Eddy.
For all Scientists study their Bibles diligently, and they know their
Magnificat. I believe that their confidence in the authenticity of
Mrs. Eddy’s inspirations is so limitless and so firmly established that
no change, however violent, which she might make in a Bible text could
disturb their composure or provoke from them a protest.</p>
<p>Her improved rendition of verse 53 went into the convention’s report
and appeared in a New York paper the next day. The (at that time)
Scientist whom I mentioned a minute ago, and who had not been present at
the convention, saw it and marvelled; marvelled and was
indignant–indignant with the printer or the telegrapher, for making so
careless and so dreadful an error. And greatly distressed, too; for, of
course, the newspaper people would fall foul of it, and be sarcastic,
and make fun of it, and have a blithe time over it, and be properly
thankful for the chance. It shows how innocent he was; it shows that he
did not know the limitations of newspaper men in the matter of Biblical
knowledge. The new verse 53 raised no insurrection in the press; in
fact, it was not even remarked upon; I could have told him the boys
would not know there was anything the matter with it. I have been a
newspaper man myself, and in those days I had my limitations like the
others.</p>
<p>The Scientist hastened to Concord and told Mrs. Eddy what a
disastrous mistake had been made, but he found to his bewilderment that
she was tranquil about it, and was not proposing to correct it. He was
not able to get her to promise to make a correction. He asked her
secretary if he had heard aright when the telegram was dictated to him;
the secretary said he had, and took the filed copy of it and verified
its authenticity by comparing it with the stenographic notes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy did make the correction, two months later, in her official
organ. It attracted no attention among the Scientists; and, naturally,
none elsewhere, for that periodical’s circulation was practically
confined to disciples of the cult.</p>
<p>That is the tale as it was told to me by an ex-Scientist. Verse 53
–renovated and spiritualized–had a narrow escape from a tremendous
celebrity. The newspaper men would have made it as famous as the
assassination of Caesar, but for their limitations.</p>
<p>To return to the Claim. I find myself greatly embarrassed by
Mrs. Eddy’s remark: “I regard self-deification as blasphemous.“ If she
is right about that, I have written a half-ream of manuscript this past
week which I must not print, either in the book which I am writing, or
elsewhere: for it goes into that very matter with extensive elaboration,
citing, in detail, words and acts of Mrs. Eddy’s which seem to me to
prove that she is a faithful and untiring worshipper of herself, and has
carried self-deification to a length which has not been before ventured
in ages. If ever. There is not room enough in this chapter for that
Survey, but I can epitomize a portion of it here.</p>
<p>With her own untaught and untrained mind, and without outside help,
she has erected upon a firm and lasting foundation the most minutely
perfect, and wonderful, and smoothly and exactly working, and best
safe-guarded system of government that has yet been devised in the
world, as I believe, and as I am sure I could prove if I had room for my
documentary evidences here.</p>
<p>It is a despotism (on this democratic soil); a sovereignty more
absolute than the Roman Papacy, more absolute than the Russian Czarship;
it has not a single power, not a shred of authority, legislative or
executive, which is not lodged solely in the sovereign; all its dreams,
its functions, its energies, have a single object, a single reason for
existing, and only the one–to build to the sky the glory of the
sovereign, and keep it bright to the end of time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is the sovereign; she devised that great place for herself,
she occupies that throne.</p>
<p>In 1895, she wrote a little primer, a little body of autocratic laws,
called the Manual of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, and put
those laws in force, in permanence. Her government is all there; all in
that deceptively innocent-looking little book, that cunning little
devilish book, that slumbering little brown volcano, with hell in its
bowels. In that book she has planned out her system, and classified and
defined its purposes and powers.</p>
<p>MAIN PARTS OF THE MACHINE</p>
<p>A Supreme Church. At Boston. Branch Churches. All over the world One
Pastor for the whole of them: to wit, her book, Science and Health. Term
of the book’s office–forever.</p>
<p>In every C.S. pulpit, two “Readers,“ a man and a woman. No talkers,
no preachers, in any Church-readers only. Readers of the Bible and her
books–no others. No commentators allowed to write or print.</p>
<p>A Church Service. She has framed it–for all the C.S. Churches
–selected its readings, its prayers, and the hymns to be used, and has
appointed the order of procedure. No changes permitted.</p>
<p>A Creed. She wrote it. All C.S. Churches must subscribe to it. No
other permitted.</p>
<p>A Treasury. At Boston. She carries the key.</p>
<p>A C.S. Book–Publishing House. For books approved by her. No others
permitted.</p>
<p>Journals and Magazines. These are organs of hers, and are controlled
by her.</p>
<p>A College. For teaching C.S.</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTION OF THE MACHINE’S POWERS AND DIGNITIES</p>
<p>Supreme Church. Pastor Emeritus–Mrs. Eddy. Board of Directors. Board
of Education. Board of Finance. College Faculty. Various Committees.
Treasurer. Clerk. First Members (of the Supreme Church). Members of the
Supreme Church.</p>
<p>It looks fair, it looks real, but it is all a fiction.</p>
<p>Even the little “Pastor Emeritus“ is a fiction. Instead of being
merely an honorary and ornamental official, Mrs. Eddy is the only
official in the entire body that has the slightest power. In her Manual,
she has provided a prodigality of ways and forms whereby she can rid
herself of any functionary in the government whenever she wants to. The
officials are all shadows, save herself; she is the only reality. She
allows no one to hold office more than a year–no one gets a chance to
become over-popular or over-useful, and dangerous. “Excommunication“ is
the favorite penalty-it is threatened at every turn. It is evidently the
pet dread and terror of the Church’s membership.</p>
<p>The member who thinks, without getting his thought from Mrs. Eddy
before uttering it, is banished permanently. One or two kinds of sinners
can plead their way back into the fold, but this one, never. To think–in
the Supreme Church–is the New Unpardonable Sin.</p>
<p>To nearly every severe and fierce rule, Mrs. Eddy adds this rivet:
“This By-law shall not be changed without the consent of the Pastor
Emeritus.“</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy is the entire Supreme Church, in her own person, in the
matter of powers and authorities.</p>
<p>Although she has provided so many ways of getting rid of
unsatisfactory members and officials, she was still afraid she might
have left a life-preserver lying around somewhere, therefore she devised
a rule to cover that defect. By applying it, she can excommunicate (and
this is perpetual again) every functionary connected with the Supreme
Church, and every one of the twenty-five thousand members of that
Church, at an hour’s notice–and do it all by herself without anybody’s
help.</p>
<p>By authority of this astonishing By-law, she has only to say a person
connected with that Church is secretly practicing hypnotism or
mesmerism; whereupon, immediate excommunication, without a hearing, is
his portion! She does not have to order a trial and produce evidence–her
accusation is all that is necessary.</p>
<p>Where is the Pope? and where the Czar? As the ballad says:</p>
<p>“Ask of the winds that far away With fragments strewed the sea!“</p>
<p>The Branch Church’s pulpit is occupied by two “Readers.“ Without them
the Branch Church is as dead as if its throat had been cut. To have
control, then, of the Readers, is to have control of the Branch
Churches. Mrs. Eddy has that control–a control wholly without limit, a
control shared with no one.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>No Reader can be appointed to any Church in the Christian Science
world without her express approval.</p></li>
<li><p>She can summarily expel from his or her place any Reader, at home
or abroad, by a mere letter of dismissal, over her signature, and
without furnishing any reason for it, to either the congregation or the
Reader.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus she has as absolute control over all Branch Churches as she has
over the Supreme Church. This power exceeds the Pope’s.</p>
<p>In simple truth, she is the only absolute sovereign in all
Christendom. The authority of the other sovereigns has limits, hers has
none, none whatever. And her yoke does not fret, does not offend. Many
of the subjects of the other monarchs feel their yoke, and are restive
under it; their loyalty is insincere. It is not so with this one’s human
property; their loyalty is genuine, earnest, sincere, enthusiastic. The
sentiment which they feel for her is one which goes out in sheer
perfection to no other occupant of a throne; for it is love, pure from
doubt, envy, exaction, fault-seeking, a love whose sun has no spot–that
form of love, strong, great, uplifting, limitless, whose vast
proportions are compassable by no word but one, the prodigious word,
Worship. And it is not as a human being that her subjects worship her,
but as a supernatural one, a divine one, one who has comradeship with
God, and speaks by His voice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy has herself created all these personal grandeurs and
autocracies–with others which I have not (in this article) mentioned.
They place her upon an Alpine solitude and supremacy of power and
spectacular show not hitherto attained by any other self-seeking
enslaver disguised in the Christian name, and they persuade me that,
although she may regard “self-deification as blasphemous,“ she is as
fond of it as I am of pie.</p>
<p>She knows about “Our Mother’s Room“ in the Supreme Church in Boston
–above referred to–for she has been in it. In a recently published North
American Review article, I quoted a lady as saying Mrs. Eddy’s portrait
could be seen there in a shrine, lit by always-burning lights, and that
C.S. disciples came and worshiped it. That remark hurt the feelings of
more than one Scientist. They said it was not true, and asked me to
correct it. I comply with pleasure. Whether the portrait was there four
years ago or not, it is not there now, for I have inquired. The only
object in the shrine now, and lit by electrics–and worshiped–is an
oil-portrait of the horse-hair chair Mrs. Eddy used to sit in when she
was writing Science and Health! It seems to me that adulation has struck
bottom, here.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eddy knows about that. She has been there, she has seen it, she
has seen the worshippers. She could abolish that sarcasm with a word.
She withholds the word. Once more I seem to recognize in her exactly the
same appetite for self-deification that I have for pie. We seem to be
curiously alike; for the love of self-deification is really only the
spiritual form of the material appetite for pie, and nothing could be
more strikingly Christian-Scientifically “harmonious.“</p>
<p>I note this phrase:</p>
<p>“Christian Science eschews divine rights in human beings.“</p>
<p>“Rights“ is vague; I do not know what it means there. Mrs. Eddy is
not well acquainted with the English language, and she is seldom able to
say in it what she is trying to say. She has no ear for the exact word,
and does not often get it. “Rights.“ Does it mean “honors?“
“attributes?“</p>
<p>“Eschews.“ This is another umbrella where there should be a torch; it
does not illumine the sentence, it only deepens the shadows. Does she
mean “denies?“ “refuses?“ “forbids?“ or something in that line? Does she
mean:</p>
<p>“Christian Science denies divine honors to human beings?“ Or:</p>
<p>“Christian Science refuses to recognize divine attributes in human
beings?“ Or:</p>
<p>“Christian Science forbids the worship of human beings?“</p>
<p>The bulk of the succeeding sentence is to me a tunnel, but, when I
emerge at this end of it, I seem to come into daylight. Then I seem to
understand both sentences–with this result:</p>
<p>“Christian Science recognizes but one God, forbids the worship of
human beings, and refuses to recognize the possession of divine
attributes by any member of the race.“</p>
<p>I am subject to correction, but I think that that is about what
Mrs. Eddy was intending to convey. Has her English–which is always
difficult to me–beguiled me into misunderstanding the following remark,
which she makes (calling herself “we,“ after an old regal fashion of
hers) in her preface to her Miscellaneous Writings?</p>
<p>“While we entertain decided views as to the best method for elevating
the race physically, morally, and spiritually, and shall express these
views as duty demands, we shall claim no especial gift from our divine
organ, no supernatural power.“</p>
<p>Was she meaning to say:</p>
<p>“Although I am of divine origin and gifted with supernatural power, I
shall not draw upon these resources in determining the best method of
elevating the race?“</p>
<p>If she had left out the word “our,“ she might then seem to say:</p>
<p>“I claim no especial or unusual degree of divine origin–“</p>
<p>Which is awkward–most awkward; for one either has a divine origin or
hasn’t; shares in it, degrees of it, are surely impossible. The idea of
crossed breeds in cattle is a thing we can entertain, for we are used to
it, and it is possible; but the idea of a divine mongrel is
unthinkable.</p>
<p>Well, then, what does she mean? I am sure I do not know, for certain.
It is the word “our“ that makes all the trouble. With the “our“ in, she
is plainly saying “my divine origin.“ The word “from“ seems to be
intended to mean “on account of.“ It has to mean that or nothing, if
“our“ is allowed to stay. The clause then says:</p>
<p>“I shall claim no especial gift on account of my divine origin.“</p>
<p>And I think that the full sentence was intended to mean what I have
already suggested:</p>
<p>“Although I am of divine origin, and gifted with supernatural power,
I shall not draw upon these resources in determining the best method of
elevating the race.“</p>
<p>When Mrs. Eddy copyrighted that Preface seven years ago, she had long
been used to regarding herself as a divine personage. I quote from
Mr. F. W. Peabody’s book:</p>
<p>“In the Christian Science Journal for April, 1889, when it was her
property, and published by her, it was claimed for her, and with her
sanction, that she was equal with Jesus, and elaborate effort was made
to establish the claim.“</p>
<p>“Mrs. Eddy has distinctly authorized the claim in her behalf, that
she herself was the chosen successor to and equal of Jesus.“</p>
<p>The following remark in that April number, quoted by Mr. Peabody,
indicates that her claim had been previously made, and had excited
“horror“ among some “good people“:</p>
<p>“Now, a word about the horror many good people have of our making the
Author of Science and Health ‘equal with Jesus.’“</p>
<p>Surely, if it had excited horror in Mrs. Eddy also, she would have
published a disclaimer. She owned the paper; she could say what she
pleased in its columns. Instead of rebuking her editor, she lets him
rebuke those “good people“ for objecting to the claim.</p>
<p>These things seem to throw light upon those words, “our [my] divine
origin.“</p>
<p>It may be that “Christian Science eschews divine rights in human
beings,“ and forbids worship of any but “one God, one Christ“; but, if
that is the case, it looks as if Mrs. Eddy is a very unsound Christian
Scientist, and needs disciplining. I believe she has a serious malady
–“self-deification“; and that it will be well to have one of the experts
demonstrate over it.</p>
<p>Meantime, let her go on living–for my sake. Closely examined,
painstakingly studied, she is easily the most interesting person on the
planet, and, in several ways, as easily the most extraordinary woman
that was ever born upon it.</p>
<p>P.S.–Since I wrote the foregoing, Mr. McCrackan’s article appeared
(in the March number of the North American Review). Before his article
appeared–that is to say, during December, January, and February–I had
written a new book, a character-portrait of Mrs. Eddy, drawn from her
own acts and words, and it was then–together with the three brief
articles previously published in the North American Review–ready to be
delivered to the printer for issue in book form. In that book, by
accident and good luck, I have answered the objections made by
Mr. McCrackan to my views, and therefore do not need to add an answer
here. Also, in it I have corrected certain misstatements of mine which
he has noticed, and several others which he has not referred to. There
are one or two important matters of opinion upon which he and I are not
in disagreement; but there are others upon which we must continue to
disagree, I suppose; indeed, I know we must; for instance, he believes
Mrs. Eddy wrote Science and Health, whereas I am quite sure I can
convince a person unhampered by predilections that she did not.</p>
<p>As concerns one considerable matter I hope to convert him. He
believes Mrs. Eddy’s word; in his article he cites her as a witness, and
takes her testimony at par; but if he will make an excursion through my
book when it comes out, and will dispassionately examine her testimonies
as there accumulated, I think he will in candor concede that she is by a
large percentage the most erratic and contradictory and untrustworthy
witness that has occupied the stand since the days of the lamented
Ananias.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the hostiles reject and repudiate all the
pretensions of Christian Science Christianity. They affirm that it has
added nothing new to Christianity; that it can do nothing that
Christianity could not do and was not doing before Christian Science was
born.</p>
<p>In that case is there no field for the new Christianity, no
opportunity for usefulness, precious usefulness, great and distinguished
usefulness? I think there is. I am far from being confident that it can
fill it, but I will indicate that unoccupied field–without charge–and if
it can conquer it, it will deserve the praise and gratitude of the
Christian world, and will get it, I am sure.</p>
<p>The present Christianity makes an excellent private Christian, but
its endeavors to make an excellent public one go for nothing,
substantially.</p>
<p>This is an honest nation–in private life. The American Christian is a
straight and clean and honest man, and in his private commerce with his
fellows can be trusted to stand faithfully by the principles of honor
and honesty imposed upon him by his religion. But the moment he comes
forward to exercise a public trust he can be confidently counted upon to
betray that trust in nine cases out of ten, if “party loyalty“ shall
require it.</p>
<p>If there are two tickets in the field in his city, one composed of
honest men and the other of notorious blatherskites and criminals, he
will not hesitate to lay his private Christian honor aside and vote for
the blatherskites if his “party honor“ shall exact it. His Christianity
is of no use to him and has no influence upon him when he is acting in a
public capacity. He has sound and sturdy private morals, but he has no
public ones. In the last great municipal election in New York, almost a
complete one-half of the votes representing 3,500,000 Christians were
cast for a ticket that had hardly a man on it whose earned and proper
place was outside of a jail. But that vote was present at church next
Sunday the same as ever, and as unconscious of its perfidy as if nothing
had happened.</p>
<p>Our Congresses consist of Christians. In their private life they are
true to every obligation of honor; yet in every session they violate
them all, and do it without shame; because honor to party is above honor
to themselves. It is an accepted law of public life that in it a man may
soil his honor in the interest of party expediency–must do it when party
expediency requires it. In private life those men would bitterly
resent–and justly–any insinuation that it would not be safe to leave
unwatched money within their reach; yet you could not wound their
feelings by reminding them that every time they vote ten dollars to the
pension appropriation nine of it is stolen money and they the marauders.
They have filched the money to take care of the party; they believe it
was right to do it; they do not see how their private honor is affected;
therefore their consciences are clear and at rest. By vote they do
wrongful things every day, in the party interest, which they could not
be persuaded to do in private life. In the interest of party expediency
they give solemn pledges, they make solemn compacts; in the interest of
party expediency they repudiate them without a blush. They would not
dream of committing these strange crimes in private life.</p>
<p>Now then, can Christian Science introduce the Congressional Blush?
There are Christian Private Morals, but there are no Christian Public
Morals, at the polls, or in Congress or anywhere else–except here and
there and scattered around like lost comets in the solar system. Can
Christian Science persuade the nation and Congress to throw away their
public morals and use none but their private ones henceforth in all
their activities, both public and private?</p>
<p>I do not think so; but no matter about me: there is the field–a grand
one, a splendid one, a sublime one, and absolutely unoccupied. Has
Christian Science confidence enough in itself to undertake to enter in
and try to possess it?</p>
<p>Make the effort, Christian Science; it is a most noble cause, and it
might succeed. It could succeed. Then we should have a new literature,
with romances entitled, How To Be an Honest Congressman Though a
Christian; How To Be a Creditable Citizen Though a Christian.</p>

<h2 id="extract-from-captain-stormfields-visit-to-heaven">EXTRACT FROM
CAPTAIN STORMFIELD’S VISIT TO HEAVEN</h2>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>Well, when I had been dead about thirty years I begun to get a little
anxious. Mind you, had been whizzing through space all that time, like a
comet. LIKE a comet! Why, Peters, I laid over the lot of them! Of course
there warn’t any of them going my way, as a steady thing, you know,
because they travel in a long circle like the loop of a lasso, whereas I
was pointed as straight as a dart for the Hereafter; but I happened on
one every now and then that was going my way for an hour or so, and then
we had a bit of a brush together. But it was generally pretty one-sided,
because I sailed by them the same as if they were standing still. An
ordinary comet don’t make more than about 200,000 miles a minute. Of
course when I came across one of that sort–like Encke’s and Halley’s
comets, for instance–it warn’t anything but just a flash and a vanish,
you see. You couldn’t rightly call it a race. It was as if the comet was
a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch. But after I got outside
of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that
was something LIKE. WE haven’t got any such comets–ours don’t begin. One
night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and
trim, and the wind in my favor–I judged I was going about a million
miles a minute–it might have been more, it couldn’t have been less–when
I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard
bow. By his stern lights I judged he was bearing about
northeast-and-by-north-half-east. Well, it was so near my course that I
wouldn’t throw away the chance; so I fell off a point, steadied my helm,
and went for him. You should have heard me whiz, and seen the electric
fur fly! In about a minute and a half I was fringed out with an
electrical nimbus that flamed around for miles and miles and lit up all
space like broad day. The comet was burning blue in the distance, like a
sickly torch, when I first sighted him, but he begun to grow bigger and
bigger as I crept up on him. I slipped up on him so fast that when I had
gone about 150,000,000 miles I was close enough to be swallowed up in
the phosphorescent glory of his wake, and I couldn’t see anything for
the glare. Thinks I, it won’t do to run into him, so I shunted to one
side and tore along. By and by I closed up abreast of his tail. Do you
know what it was like? It was like a gnat closing up on the continent of
America. I forged along. By and by I had sailed along his coast for a
little upwards of a hundred and fifty million miles, and then I could
see by the shape of him that I hadn’t even got up to his waistband yet.
Why, Peters, WE don’t know anything about comets, down here. If you want
to see comets that ARE comets, you’ve got to go outside of our solar
system –where there’s room for them, you understand. My friend, I’ve
seen comets out there that couldn’t even lay down inside the ORBITS of
our noblest comets without their tails hanging over.</p>
<p>Well, I boomed along another hundred and fifty million miles, and got
up abreast his shoulder, as you may say. I was feeling pretty fine, I
tell you; but just then I noticed the officer of the deck come to the
side and hoist his glass in my direction. Straight off I heard him sing
out–“Below there, ahoy! Shake her up, shake her up! Heave on a hundred
million billion tons of brimstone!“</p>
<p>“Ay-ay, sir!“</p>
<p>“Pipe the stabboard watch! All hands on deck!“</p>
<p>“Ay-ay, sir!“</p>
<p>“Send two hundred thousand million men aloft to shake out royals and
sky-scrapers!“</p>
<p>“Ay-ay, sir!“</p>
<p>“Hand the stuns’ls! Hang out every rag you’ve got! Clothe her from
stem to rudder-post!“</p>
<p>“Ay-ay, sir!“</p>
<p>In about a second I begun to see I’d woke up a pretty ugly customer,
Peters. In less than ten seconds that comet was just a blazing cloud of
red-hot canvas. It was piled up into the heavens clean out of sight–the
old thing seemed to swell out and occupy all space; the sulphur smoke
from the furnaces–oh, well, nobody can describe the way it rolled and
tumbled up into the skies, and nobody can half describe the way it
smelt. Neither can anybody begin to describe the way that monstrous
craft begun to crash along. And such another powwow–thousands of
bo’s’n’s whistles screaming at once, and a crew like the populations of
a hundred thousand worlds like ours all swearing at once. Well, I never
heard the like of it before.</p>
<p>We roared and thundered along side by side, both doing our level
best, because I’d never struck a comet before that could lay over me,
and so I was bound to beat this one or break something. I judged I had
some reputation in space, and I calculated to keep it. I noticed I
wasn’t gaining as fast, now, as I was before, but still I was gaining.
There was a power of excitement on board the comet. Upwards of a hundred
billion passengers swarmed up from below and rushed to the side and
begun to bet on the race. Of course this careened her and damaged her
speed. My, but wasn’t the mate mad! He jumped at that crowd, with his
trumpet in his hand, and sung out–</p>
<p>“Amidships! amidships, you! {1} or I’ll brain the last idiot of
you!“</p>
<p>Well, sir, I gained and gained, little by little, till at last I went
skimming sweetly by the magnificent old conflagration’s nose. By this
time the captain of the comet had been rousted out, and he stood there
in the red glare for’ard, by the mate, in his shirt-sleeves and
slippers, his hair all rats’ nests and one suspender hanging, and how
sick those two men did look! I just simply couldn’t help putting my
thumb to my nose as I glided away and singing out:</p>
<p>“Ta-ta! ta-ta! Any word to send to your family?“</p>
<p>Peters, it was a mistake. Yes, sir, I’ve often regretted that–it was
a mistake. You see, the captain had given up the race, but that remark
was too tedious for him–he couldn’t stand it. He turned to the mate, and
says he–</p>
<p>“Have we got brimstone enough of our own to make the trip?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“Sure?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir–more than enough.“</p>
<p>“How much have we got in cargo for Satan?“</p>
<p>“Eighteen hundred thousand billion quintillions of kazarks.“</p>
<p>“Very well, then, let his boarders freeze till the next comet comes.
Lighten ship! Lively, now, lively, men! Heave the whole cargo
overboard!“</p>
<p>Peters, look me in the eye, and be calm. I found out, over there,
that a kazark is exactly the bulk of a HUNDRED AND SIXTY-NINE WORLDS
LIKE OURS! They hove all that load overboard. When it fell it wiped out
a considerable raft of stars just as clean as if they’d been candles and
somebody blowed them out. As for the race, that was at an end. The
minute she was lightened the comet swung along by me the same as if I
was anchored. The captain stood on the stern, by the after-davits, and
put his thumb to his nose and sung out–</p>
<p>“Ta-ta! ta-ta! Maybe YOU’VE got some message to send your friends in
the Everlasting Tropics!“</p>
<p>Then he hove up his other suspender and started for’ard, and inside
of three-quarters of an hour his craft was only a pale torch again in
the distance. Yes, it was a mistake, Peters–that remark of mine. I don’t
reckon I’ll ever get over being sorry about it. I’d ‘a’ beat the bully
of the firmament if I’d kept my mouth shut.</p>
<p>But I’ve wandered a little off the track of my tale; I’ll get back on
my course again. Now you see what kind of speed I was making. So, as I
said, when I had been tearing along this way about thirty years I begun
to get uneasy. Oh, it was pleasant enough, with a good deal to find out,
but then it was kind of lonesome, you know. Besides, I wanted to get
somewhere. I hadn’t shipped with the idea of cruising forever. First
off, I liked the delay, because I judged I was going to fetch up in
pretty warm quarters when I got through; but towards the last I begun to
feel that I’d rather go to–well, most any place, so as to finish up the
uncertainty.</p>
<p>Well, one night–it was always night, except when I was rushing by
some star that was occupying the whole universe with its fire and its
glare–light enough then, of course, but I necessarily left it behind in
a minute or two and plunged into a solid week of darkness again. The
stars ain’t so close together as they look to be. Where was I? Oh yes;
one night I was sailing along, when I discovered a tremendous long row
of blinking lights away on the horizon ahead. As I approached, they
begun to tower and swell and look like mighty furnaces. Says I to
myself–</p>
<p>“By George, I’ve arrived at last–and at the wrong place, just as I
expected!“</p>
<p>Then I fainted. I don’t know how long I was insensible, but it must
have been a good while, for, when I came to, the darkness was all gone
and there was the loveliest sunshine and the balmiest, fragrantest air
in its place. And there was such a marvellous world spread out before
me–such a glowing, beautiful, bewitching country. The things I took for
furnaces were gates, miles high, made all of flashing jewels, and they
pierced a wall of solid gold that you couldn’t see the top of, nor yet
the end of, in either direction. I was pointed straight for one of these
gates, and a-coming like a house afire. Now I noticed that the skies
were black with millions of people, pointed for those gates. What a roar
they made, rushing through the air! The ground was as thick as ants with
people, too–billions of them, I judge.</p>
<p>I lit. I drifted up to a gate with a swarm of people, and when it was
my turn the head clerk says, in a business-like way–</p>
<p>“Well, quick! Where are you from?“</p>
<p>“San Francisco,“ says I.</p>
<p>“San Fran–WHAT?“ says he.</p>
<p>“San Francisco.“</p>
<p>He scratched his head and looked puzzled, then he says–</p>
<p>“Is it a planet?“</p>
<p>By George, Peters, think of it! “PLANET?“ says I; “it’s a city. And
moreover, it’s one of the biggest and finest and–“</p>
<p>“There, there!“ says he, “no time here for conversation. We don’t
deal in cities here. Where are you from in a GENERAL way?“</p>
<p>“Oh,“ I says, “I beg your pardon. Put me down for California.“</p>
<p>I had him AGAIN, Peters! He puzzled a second, then he says, sharp and
irritable–</p>
<p>“I don’t know any such planet–is it a constellation?“</p>
<p>“Oh, my goodness!“ says I. “Constellation, says you? No–it’s a
State.“</p>
<p>“Man, we don’t deal in States here. WILL you tell me where you are
from IN GENERAL–AT LARGE, don’t you understand?“</p>
<p>“Oh, now I get your idea,“ I says. “I’m from America,–the United
States of America.“</p>
<p>Peters, do you know I had him AGAIN? If I hadn’t I’m a clam! His face
was as blank as a target after a militia shooting-match. He turned to an
under clerk and says–</p>
<p>“Where is America? WHAT is America?“</p>
<p>The under clerk answered up prompt and says–</p>
<p>“There ain’t any such orb.“</p>
<p>“ORB?“ says I. “Why, what are you talking about, young man? It ain’t
an orb; it’s a country; it’s a continent. Columbus discovered it; I
reckon likely you’ve heard of HIM, anyway. America–why, sir,
America–“</p>
<p>“Silence!“ says the head clerk. “Once for all,
where–are–you–FROM?“</p>
<p>“Well,“ says I, “I don’t know anything more to say–unless I lump
things, and just say I’m from the world.“</p>
<p>“Ah,“ says he, brightening up, “now that’s something like! WHAT
world?“</p>
<p>Peters, he had ME, that time. I looked at him, puzzled, he looked at
me, worried. Then he burst out–</p>
<p>“Come, come, what world?“</p>
<p>Says I, “Why, THE world, of course.“</p>
<p>“THE world!“ he says. “H’m! there’s billions of them! . . .
Next!“</p>
<p>That meant for me to stand aside. I done so, and a sky-blue man with
seven heads and only one leg hopped into my place. I took a walk. It
just occurred to me, then, that all the myriads I had seen swarming to
that gate, up to this time, were just like that creature. I tried to run
across somebody I was acquainted with, but they were out of
acquaintances of mine just then. So I thought the thing all over and
finally sidled back there pretty meek and feeling rather stumped, as you
may say.</p>
<p>“Well?“ said the head clerk.</p>
<p>“Well, sir,“ I says, pretty humble, “I don’t seem to make out which
world it is I’m from. But you may know it from this–it’s the one the
Saviour saved.“</p>
<p>He bent his head at the Name. Then he says, gently–</p>
<p>“The worlds He has saved are like to the gates of heaven in number
–none can count them. What astronomical system is your world in?
–perhaps that may assist.“</p>
<p>“It’s the one that has the sun in it–and the moon–and Mars“–he shook
his head at each name–hadn’t ever heard of them, you see –“and
Neptune–and Uranus–and Jupiter–“</p>
<p>“Hold on!“ says he–“hold on a minute! Jupiter . . . Jupiter . . .
Seems to me we had a man from there eight or nine hundred years ago–but
people from that system very seldom enter by this gate.“ All of a sudden
he begun to look me so straight in the eye that I thought he was going
to bore through me. Then he says, very deliberate, “Did you come
STRAIGHT HERE from your system?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,“ I says–but I blushed the least little bit in the world
when I said it.</p>
<p>He looked at me very stern, and says–</p>
<p>“That is not true; and this is not the place for prevarication. You
wandered from your course. How did that happen?“</p>
<p>Says I, blushing again–</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, and I take back what I said, and confess. I raced a
little with a comet one day–only just the least little bit–only the
tiniest lit–“</p>
<p>“So–so,“ says he–and without any sugar in his voice to speak of.</p>
<p>I went on, and says–</p>
<p>“But I only fell off just a bare point, and I went right back on my
course again the minute the race was over.“</p>
<p>“No matter–that divergence has made all this trouble. It has brought
you to a gate that is billions of leagues from the right one. If you had
gone to your own gate they would have known all about your world at once
and there would have been no delay. But we will try to accommodate you.“
He turned to an under clerk and says–</p>
<p>“What system is Jupiter in?“</p>
<p>“I don’t remember, sir, but I think there is such a planet in one of
the little new systems away out in one of the thinly worlded corners of
the universe. I will see.“</p>
<p>He got a balloon and sailed up and up and up, in front of a map that
was as big as Rhode Island. He went on up till he was out of sight, and
by and by he came down and got something to eat and went up again. To
cut a long story short, he kept on doing this for a day or two, and
finally he came down and said he thought he had found that solar system,
but it might be fly-specks. So he got a microscope and went back. It
turned out better than he feared. He had rousted out our system, sure
enough. He got me to describe our planet and its distance from the sun,
and then he says to his chief–</p>
<p>“Oh, I know the one he means, now, sir. It is on the map. It is
called the Wart.“</p>
<p>Says I to myself, “Young man, it wouldn’t be wholesome for you to go
down THERE and call it the Wart.“</p>
<p>Well, they let me in, then, and told me I was safe forever and
wouldn’t have any more trouble.</p>
<p>Then they turned from me and went on with their work, the same as if
they considered my case all complete and shipshape. I was a good deal
surprised at this, but I was diffident about speaking up and reminding
them. I did so hate to do it, you know; it seemed a pity to bother them,
they had so much on their hands. Twice I thought I would give up and let
the thing go; so twice I started to leave, but immediately I thought
what a figure I should cut stepping out amongst the redeemed in such a
rig, and that made me hang back and come to anchor again. People got to
eying me –clerks, you know–wondering why I didn’t get under way. I
couldn’t stand this long–it was too uncomfortable. So at last I plucked
up courage and tipped the head clerk a signal. He says–</p>
<p>“What! you here yet? What’s wanting?“</p>
<p>Says I, in a low voice and very confidential, making a trumpet with
my hands at his ear–</p>
<p>“I beg pardon, and you mustn’t mind my reminding you, and seeming to
meddle, but hain’t you forgot something?“</p>
<p>He studied a second, and says–</p>
<p>“Forgot something? . . . No, not that I know of.“</p>
<p>“Think,“ says I.</p>
<p>He thought. Then he says–</p>
<p>“No, I can’t seem to have forgot anything. What is it?“</p>
<p>“Look at me,“ says I, “look me all over.“</p>
<p>He done it.</p>
<p>“Well?“ says he.</p>
<p>“Well,“ says I, “you don’t notice anything? If I branched out amongst
the elect looking like this, wouldn’t I attract considerable
attention?–wouldn’t I be a little conspicuous?“</p>
<p>“Well,“ he says, “I don’t see anything the matter. What do you
lack?“</p>
<p>“Lack! Why, I lack my harp, and my wreath, and my halo, and my
hymn-book, and my palm branch–I lack everything that a body naturally
requires up here, my friend.“</p>
<p>Puzzled? Peters, he was the worst puzzled man you ever saw. Finally
he says–</p>
<p>“Well, you seem to be a curiosity every way a body takes you. I never
heard of these things before.“</p>
<p>I looked at the man awhile in solid astonishment; then I says–</p>
<p>“Now, I hope you don’t take it as an offence, for I don’t mean any,
but really, for a man that has been in the Kingdom as long as I reckon
you have, you do seem to know powerful little about its customs.“</p>
<p>“Its customs!“ says he. “Heaven is a large place, good friend. Large
empires have many and diverse customs. Even small dominions have, as you
doubtless know by what you have seen of the matter on a small scale in
the Wart. How can you imagine I could ever learn the varied customs of
the countless kingdoms of heaven? It makes my head ache to think of it.
I know the customs that prevail in those portions inhabited by peoples
that are appointed to enter by my own gate–and hark ye, that is quite
enough knowledge for one individual to try to pack into his head in the
thirty-seven millions of years I have devoted night and day to that
study. But the idea of learning the customs of the whole appalling
expanse of heaven–O man, how insanely you talk! Now I don’t doubt that
this odd costume you talk about is the fashion in that district of
heaven you belong to, but you won’t be conspicuous in this section
without it.“</p>
<p>I felt all right, if that was the case, so I bade him good-day and
left. All day I walked towards the far end of a prodigious hall of the
office, hoping to come out into heaven any moment, but it was a mistake.
That hall was built on the general heavenly plan–it naturally couldn’t
be small. At last I got so tired I couldn’t go any farther; so I sat
down to rest, and begun to tackle the queerest sort of strangers and ask
for information, but I didn’t get any; they couldn’t understand my
language, and I could not understand theirs. I got dreadfully lonesome.
I was so down-hearted and homesick I wished a hundred times I never had
died. I turned back, of course. About noon next day, I got back at last
and was on hand at the booking-office once more. Says I to the head
clerk–</p>
<p>“I begin to see that a man’s got to be in his own Heaven to be
happy.“</p>
<p>“Perfectly correct,“ says he. “Did you imagine the same heaven would
suit all sorts of men?“</p>
<p>“Well, I had that idea–but I see the foolishness of it. Which way am
I to go to get to my district?“</p>
<p>He called the under clerk that had examined the map, and he gave me
general directions. I thanked him and started; but he says–</p>
<p>“Wait a minute; it is millions of leagues from here. Go outside and
stand on that red wishing-carpet; shut your eyes, hold your breath, and
wish yourself there.“</p>
<p>“I’m much obliged,“ says I; “why didn’t you dart me through when I
first arrived?“</p>
<p>“We have a good deal to think of here; it was your place to think of
it and ask for it. Good-by; we probably sha’n’t see you in this region
for a thousand centuries or so.“</p>
<p>“In that case, o revoor,“ says I.</p>
<p>I hopped onto the carpet and held my breath and shut my eyes and
wished I was in the booking-office of my own section. The very next
instant a voice I knew sung out in a business kind of a way–</p>
<p>“A harp and a hymn-book, pair of wings and a halo, size 13, for Cap’n
Eli Stormfield, of San Francisco!–make him out a clean bill of health,
and let him in.“</p>
<p>I opened my eyes. Sure enough, it was a Pi Ute Injun I used to know
in Tulare County; mighty good fellow–I remembered being at his funeral,
which consisted of him being burnt and the other Injuns gauming their
faces with his ashes and howling like wildcats. He was powerful glad to
see me, and you may make up your mind I was just as glad to see him, and
feel that I was in the right kind of a heaven at last.</p>
<p>Just as far as your eye could reach, there was swarms of clerks,
running and bustling around, tricking out thousands of Yanks and
Mexicans and English and Arabs, and all sorts of people in their new
outfits; and when they gave me my kit and I put on my halo and took a
look in the glass, I could have jumped over a house for joy, I was so
happy. “Now THIS is something like!“ says I. “Now,“ says I, “I’m all
right–show me a cloud.“</p>
<p>Inside of fifteen minutes I was a mile on my way towards the
cloud-banks and about a million people along with me. Most of us tried
to fly, but some got crippled and nobody made a success of it. So we
concluded to walk, for the present, till we had had some wing
practice.</p>
<p>We begun to meet swarms of folks who were coming back. Some had harps
and nothing else; some had hymn-books and nothing else; some had nothing
at all; all of them looked meek and uncomfortable; one young fellow
hadn’t anything left but his halo, and he was carrying that in his hand;
all of a sudden he offered it to me and says–</p>
<p>“Will you hold it for me a minute?“</p>
<p>Then he disappeared in the crowd. I went on. A woman asked me to hold
her palm branch, and then SHE disappeared. A girl got me to hold her
harp for her, and by George, SHE disappeared; and so on and so on, till
I was about loaded down to the guards. Then comes a smiling old
gentleman and asked me to hold HIS things. I swabbed off the
perspiration and says, pretty tart–</p>
<p>“I’ll have to get you to excuse me, my friend,–<em>I</em> ain’t no
hat-rack.“</p>
<p>About this time I begun to run across piles of those traps, lying in
the road. I just quietly dumped my extra cargo along with them. I looked
around, and, Peters, that whole nation that was following me were loaded
down the same as I’d been. The return crowd had got them to hold their
things a minute, you see. They all dumped their loads, too, and we went
on.</p>
<p>When I found myself perched on a cloud, with a million other people,
I never felt so good in my life. Says I, “Now this is according to the
promises; I’ve been having my doubts, but now I am in heaven, sure
enough.“ I gave my palm branch a wave or two, for luck, and then I
tautened up my harp-strings and struck in. Well, Peters, you can’t
imagine anything like the row we made. It was grand to listen to, and
made a body thrill all over, but there was considerable many tunes going
on at once, and that was a drawback to the harmony, you understand; and
then there was a lot of Injun tribes, and they kept up such another
war-whooping that they kind of took the tuck out of the music. By and by
I quit performing, and judged I’d take a rest. There was quite a nice
mild old gentleman sitting next me, and I noticed he didn’t take a hand;
I encouraged him, but he said he was naturally bashful, and was afraid
to try before so many people. By and by the old gentleman said he never
could seem to enjoy music somehow. The fact was, I was beginning to feel
the same way; but I didn’t say anything. Him and I had a considerable
long silence, then, but of course it warn’t noticeable in that place.
After about sixteen or seventeen hours, during which I played and sung a
little, now and then –always the same tune, because I didn’t know any
other–I laid down my harp and begun to fan myself with my palm branch.
Then we both got to sighing pretty regular. Finally, says he–</p>
<p>“Don’t you know any tune but the one you’ve been pegging at all
day?“</p>
<p>“Not another blessed one,“ says I.</p>
<p>“Don’t you reckon you could learn another one?“ says he.</p>
<p>“Never,“ says I; “I’ve tried to, but I couldn’t manage it.“</p>
<p>“It’s a long time to hang to the one–eternity, you know.“</p>
<p>“Don’t break my heart,“ says I; “I’m getting low-spirited enough
already.“</p>
<p>After another long silence, says he–</p>
<p>“Are you glad to be here?“</p>
<p>Says I, “Old man, I’ll be frank with you. This AIN’T just as near my
idea of bliss as I thought it was going to be, when I used to go to
church.“</p>
<p>Says he, “What do you say to knocking off and calling it half a
day?“</p>
<p>“That’s me,“ says I. “I never wanted to get off watch so bad in my
life.“</p>
<p>So we started. Millions were coming to the cloud-bank all the time,
happy and hosannahing; millions were leaving it all the time, looking
mighty quiet, I tell you. We laid for the new-comers, and pretty soon
I’d got them to hold all my things a minute, and then I was a free man
again and most outrageously happy. Just then I ran across old Sam
Bartlett, who had been dead a long time, and stopped to have a talk with
him. Says I–</p>
<p>“Now tell me–is this to go on forever? Ain’t there anything else for
a change?“</p>
<p>Says he–</p>
<p>“I’ll set you right on that point very quick. People take the
figurative language of the Bible and the allegories for literal, and the
first thing they ask for when they get here is a halo and a harp, and so
on. Nothing that’s harmless and reasonable is refused a body here, if he
asks it in the right spirit. So they are outfitted with these things
without a word. They go and sing and play just about one day, and that’s
the last you’ll ever see them in the choir. They don’t need anybody to
tell them that that sort of thing wouldn’t make a heaven–at least not a
heaven that a sane man could stand a week and remain sane. That
cloud-bank is placed where the noise can’t disturb the old inhabitants,
and so there ain’t any harm in letting everybody get up there and cure
himself as soon as he comes.</p>
<p>“Now you just remember this–heaven is as blissful and lovely as it
can be; but it’s just the busiest place you ever heard of. There ain’t
any idle people here after the first day. Singing hymns and waving palm
branches through all eternity is pretty when you hear about it in the
pulpit, but it’s as poor a way to put in valuable time as a body could
contrive. It would just make a heaven of warbling ignoramuses, don’t you
see? Eternal Rest sounds comforting in the pulpit, too. Well, you try it
once, and see how heavy time will hang on your hands. Why, Stormfield, a
man like you, that had been active and stirring all his life, would go
mad in six months in a heaven where he hadn’t anything to do. Heaven is
the very last place to come to REST in,–and don’t you be afraid to bet
on that!“</p>
<p>Says I–</p>
<p>“Sam, I’m as glad to hear it as I thought I’d be sorry. I’m glad I
come, now.“</p>
<p>Says he–</p>
<p>“Cap’n, ain’t you pretty physically tired?“</p>
<p>Says I–</p>
<p>“Sam, it ain’t any name for it! I’m dog-tired.“</p>
<p>“Just so–just so. You’ve earned a good sleep, and you’ll get it.
You’ve earned a good appetite, and you’ll enjoy your dinner. It’s the
same here as it is on earth–you’ve got to earn a thing, square and
honest, before you enjoy it. You can’t enjoy first and earn afterwards.
But there’s this difference, here: you can choose your own occupation,
and all the powers of heaven will be put forth to help you make a
success of it, if you do your level best. The shoe-maker on earth that
had the soul of a poet in him won’t have to make shoes here.“</p>
<p>“Now that’s all reasonable and right,“ says I. “Plenty of work, and
the kind you hanker after; no more pain, no more suffering–“</p>
<p>“Oh, hold on; there’s plenty of pain here–but it don’t kill. There’s
plenty of suffering here, but it don’t last. You see, happiness ain’t a
THING IN ITSELF–it’s only a CONTRAST with something that ain’t pleasant.
That’s all it is. There ain’t a thing you can mention that is happiness
in its own self–it’s only so by contrast with the other thing. And so,
as soon as the novelty is over and the force of the contrast dulled, it
ain’t happiness any longer, and you have to get something fresh. Well,
there’s plenty of pain and suffering in heaven–consequently there’s
plenty of contrasts, and just no end of happiness.“</p>
<p>Says I, “It’s the sensiblest heaven I’ve heard of yet, Sam, though
it’s about as different from the one I was brought up on as a live
princess is different from her own wax figger.“</p>
<p>Along in the first months I knocked around about the Kingdom, making
friends and looking at the country, and finally settled down in a pretty
likely region, to have a rest before taking another start. I went on
making acquaintances and gathering up information. I had a good deal of
talk with an old bald-headed angel by the name of Sandy McWilliams. He
was from somewhere in New Jersey. I went about with him, considerable.
We used to lay around, warm afternoons, in the shade of a rock, on some
meadow-ground that was pretty high and out of the marshy slush of his
cranberry-farm, and there we used to talk about all kinds of things, and
smoke pipes. One day, says I–</p>
<p>“About how old might you be, Sandy?“</p>
<p>“Seventy-two.“</p>
<p>“I judged so. How long you been in heaven?“</p>
<p>“Twenty-seven years, come Christmas.“</p>
<p>“How old was you when you come up?“</p>
<p>“Why, seventy-two, of course.“</p>
<p>“You can’t mean it!“</p>
<p>“Why can’t I mean it?“</p>
<p>“Because, if you was seventy-two then, you are naturally ninety-nine
now.“</p>
<p>“No, but I ain’t. I stay the same age I was when I come.“</p>
<p>“Well,“ says I, “come to think, there’s something just here that I
want to ask about. Down below, I always had an idea that in heaven we
would all be young, and bright, and spry.“</p>
<p>“Well, you can be young if you want to. You’ve only got to wish.“</p>
<p>“Well, then, why didn’t you wish?“</p>
<p>“I did. They all do. You’ll try it, some day, like enough; but you’ll
get tired of the change pretty soon.“</p>
<p>“Why?“</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll tell you. Now you’ve always been a sailor; did you ever
try some other business?“</p>
<p>“Yes, I tried keeping grocery, once, up in the mines; but I couldn’t
stand it; it was too dull–no stir, no storm, no life about it; it was
like being part dead and part alive, both at the same time. I wanted to
be one thing or t’other. I shut up shop pretty quick and went to
sea.“</p>
<p>“That’s it. Grocery people like it, but you couldn’t. You see you
wasn’t used to it. Well, I wasn’t used to being young, and I couldn’t
seem to take any interest in it. I was strong, and handsome, and had
curly hair,–yes, and wings, too!–gay wings like a butterfly. I went to
picnics and dances and parties with the fellows, and tried to carry on
and talk nonsense with the girls, but it wasn’t any use; I couldn’t take
to it–fact is, it was an awful bore. What I wanted was early to bed and
early to rise, and something to DO; and when my work was done, I wanted
to sit quiet, and smoke and think–not tear around with a parcel of giddy
young kids. You can’t think what I suffered whilst I was young.“</p>
<p>“How long was you young?“</p>
<p>“Only two weeks. That was plenty for me. Laws, I was so lonesome! You
see, I was full of the knowledge and experience of seventy-two years;
the deepest subject those young folks could strike was only a-b-c to me.
And to hear them argue–oh, my! it would have been funny, if it hadn’t
been so pitiful. Well, I was so hungry for the ways and the sober talk I
was used to, that I tried to ring in with the old people, but they
wouldn’t have it. They considered me a conceited young upstart, and gave
me the cold shoulder. Two weeks was a-plenty for me. I was glad to get
back my bald head again, and my pipe, and my old drowsy reflections in
the shade of a rock or a tree.“</p>
<p>“Well,“ says I, “do you mean to say you’re going to stand still at
seventy-two, forever?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know, and I ain’t particular. But I ain’t going to drop back
to twenty-five any more–I know that, mighty well. I know a sight more
than I did twenty-seven years ago, and I enjoy learning, all the time,
but I don’t seem to get any older. That is, bodily –my mind gets older,
and stronger, and better seasoned, and more satisfactory.“</p>
<p>Says I, “If a man comes here at ninety, don’t he ever set himself
back?“</p>
<p>“Of course he does. He sets himself back to fourteen; tries it a
couple of hours, and feels like a fool; sets himself forward to twenty;
it ain’t much improvement; tries thirty, fifty, eighty, and finally
ninety–finds he is more at home and comfortable at the same old figure
he is used to than any other way. Or, if his mind begun to fail him on
earth at eighty, that’s where he finally sticks up here. He sticks at
the place where his mind was last at its best, for there’s where his
enjoyment is best, and his ways most set and established.“</p>
<p>“Does a chap of twenty-five stay always twenty-five, and look
it?“</p>
<p>“If he is a fool, yes. But if he is bright, and ambitious and
industrious, the knowledge he gains and the experiences he has, change
his ways and thoughts and likings, and make him find his best pleasure
in the company of people above that age; so he allows his body to take
on that look of as many added years as he needs to make him comfortable
and proper in that sort of society; he lets his body go on taking the
look of age, according as he progresses, and by and by he will be bald
and wrinkled outside, and wise and deep within.“</p>
<p>“Babies the same?“</p>
<p>“Babies the same. Laws, what asses we used to be, on earth, about
these things! We said we’d be always young in heaven. We didn’t say HOW
young–we didn’t think of that, perhaps–that is, we didn’t all think
alike, anyway. When I was a boy of seven, I suppose I thought we’d all
be twelve, in heaven; when I was twelve, I suppose I thought we’d all be
eighteen or twenty in heaven; when I was forty, I begun to go back; I
remember I hoped we’d all be about THIRTY years old in heaven. Neither a
man nor a boy ever thinks the age he HAS is exactly the best one–he puts
the right age a few years older or a few years younger than he is. Then
he makes that ideal age the general age of the heavenly people. And he
expects everybody TO STICK at that age–stand stock-still–and expects
them to enjoy it!–Now just think of the idea of standing still in
heaven! Think of a heaven made up entirely of hoop-rolling,
marble-playing cubs of seven years!–or of awkward, diffident,
sentimental immaturities of nineteen!–or of vigorous people of thirty,
healthy-minded, brimming with ambition, but chained hand and foot to
that one age and its limitations like so many helpless galley-slaves!
Think of the dull sameness of a society made up of people all of one age
and one set of looks, habits, tastes and feelings. Think how superior to
it earth would be, with its variety of types and faces and ages, and the
enlivening attrition of the myriad interests that come into pleasant
collision in such a variegated society.“</p>
<p>“Look here,“ says I, “do you know what you’re doing?“</p>
<p>“Well, what am I doing?“</p>
<p>“You are making heaven pretty comfortable in one way, but you are
playing the mischief with it in another.“</p>
<p>“How d’you mean?“</p>
<p>“Well,“ I says, “take a young mother that’s lost her child, and–“</p>
<p>“Sh!“ he says. “Look!“</p>
<p>It was a woman. Middle-aged, and had grizzled hair. She was walking
slow, and her head was bent down, and her wings hanging limp and droopy;
and she looked ever so tired, and was crying, poor thing! She passed
along by, with her head down, that way, and the tears running down her
face, and didn’t see us. Then Sandy said, low and gentle, and full of
pity:</p>
<p>“SHE’S hunting for her child! No, FOUND it, I reckon. Lord, how she’s
changed! But I recognized her in a minute, though it’s twenty-seven
years since I saw her. A young mother she was, about twenty two or four,
or along there; and blooming and lovely and sweet? oh, just a flower!
And all her heart and all her soul was wrapped up in her child, her
little girl, two years old. And it died, and she went wild with grief,
just wild! Well, the only comfort she had was that she’d see her child
again, in heaven –‘never more to part,’ she said, and kept on saying it
over and over, ‘never more to part.’ And the words made her happy; yes,
they did; they made her joyful, and when I was dying, twenty-seven years
ago, she told me to find her child the first thing, and say she was
coming–‘soon, soon, VERY soon, she hoped and believed!’“</p>
<p>“Why, it’s pitiful, Sandy.“</p>
<p>He didn’t say anything for a while, but sat looking at the ground,
thinking. Then he says, kind of mournful:</p>
<p>“And now she’s come!“</p>
<p>“Well? Go on.“</p>
<p>“Stormfield, maybe she hasn’t found the child, but <em>I</em> think
she has. Looks so to me. I’ve seen cases before. You see, she’s kept
that child in her head just the same as it was when she jounced it in
her arms a little chubby thing. But here it didn’t elect to STAY a
child. No, it elected to grow up, which it did. And in these
twenty-seven years it has learned all the deep scientific learning there
is to learn, and is studying and studying and learning and learning more
and more, all the time, and don’t give a damn for anything BUT learning;
just learning, and discussing gigantic problems with people like
herself.“</p>
<p>“Well?“</p>
<p>“Stormfield, don’t you see? Her mother knows CRANBERRIES, and how to
tend them, and pick them, and put them up, and market them; and not
another blamed thing! Her and her daughter can’t be any more company for
each other NOW than mud turtle and bird o’ paradise. Poor thing, she was
looking for a baby to jounce; <em>I</em> think she’s struck a
disapp’intment.“</p>
<p>“Sandy, what will they do–stay unhappy forever in heaven?“</p>
<p>“No, they’ll come together and get adjusted by and by. But not this
year, and not next. By and by.“</p>
