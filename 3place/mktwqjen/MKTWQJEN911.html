are exceedingly scarce through all this period. Mark Twain, now on his
second visit to London, was literally overwhelmed with honors and
entertainment; his rooms at the Langham were like a court. Such men as
Robert Browning, Turgenieff, Sir John Millais, and Charles Kingsley
hastened to call. Kingsley and others gave him dinners. Mrs. Clemens to
her sister wrote: “It is perfectly discouraging to try to write
you.“</h4>
<p>The continuous excitement presently told on her. In July all further
engagements were canceled, and Clemens took his little family to
Scotland, for quiet and rest. They broke the journey at York, and it was
there that Mark Twain wrote the only letter remaining from this
time.</p>
<p>Part of a letter to Mrs. Jervis Langdon, of Elmira, N. Y.:</p>
<p>For the present we shall remain in this queer old walled town, with
its crooked, narrow lanes, that tell us of their old day that knew no
wheeled vehicles; its plaster-and-timber dwellings, with upper stories
far overhanging the street, and thus marking their date, say three
hundred years ago; the stately city walls, the castellated gates, the
ivy-grown, foliage-sheltered, most noble and picturesque ruin of
St. Mary’s Abbey, suggesting their date, say five hundred years ago, in
the heart of Crusading times and the glory of English chivalry and
romance; the vast Cathedral of York, with its worn carvings and quaintly
pictured windows, preaching of still remoter days; the outlandish names
of streets and courts and byways that stand as a record and a memorial,
all these centuries, of Danish dominion here in still earlier times; the
hint here and there of King Arthur and his knights and their bloody
fights with Saxon oppressors round about this old city more than
thirteen hundred years gone by; and, last of all, the melancholy old
stone coffins and sculptured inscriptions, a venerable arch and a hoary
tower of stone that still remain and are kissed by the sun and caressed
by the shadows every day, just as the sun and the shadows have kissed
and caressed them every lagging day since the Roman Emperor’s soldiers
placed them here in the times when Jesus the Son of Mary walked the
streets of Nazareth a youth, with no more name or fame than the
Yorkshire boy who is loitering down this street this moment.</p>
<p>Their destination was Edinburgh, where they remained a month.
Mrs. Clemens’s health gave way on their arrival there, and her husband,
knowing the name of no other physician in the place, looked up Dr. John
Brown, author of Rab and His Friends, and found in him not only a
skilful practitioner, but a lovable companion, to whom they all became
deeply attached. Little Susy, now seventeen months old, became his
special favorite. He named her Megalops, because of her great eyes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens regained her strength and they returned to London.
Clemens, still urged to lecture, finally agreed with George Dolby to a
week’s engagement, and added a promise that after taking his wife and
daughter back to America he would return immediately for a more extended
course. Dolby announced him to appear at the Queen’s Concert Rooms,
Hanover Square, for the week of October 13-18, his lecture to be the old
Sandwich Islands talk that seven years before had brought him his first
success. The great hall, the largest in London, was thronged at each
appearance, and the papers declared that Mark Twain had no more than
“whetted the public appetite“ for his humor. Three days later, October
1873, Clemens, with his little party, sailed for home. Half-way across
the ocean he wrote the friend they had left in Scotland:</p>
<p>To Dr. John Brown, in Edinburgh:</p>
<p>MID-ATLANTIC, Oct. 30, 1873. OUR DEAR FRIEND THE DOCTOR,–We have
plowed a long way over the sea, and there’s twenty-two hundred miles of
restless water between us, now, besides the railway stretch. And yet you
are so present with us, so close to us that a span and a whisper would
bridge the distance.</p>
<p>The first three days were stormy, and wife, child, maid, and Miss
Spaulding were all sea-sick 25 hours out of the 24, and I was sorry I
ever started. However, it has been smooth, and balmy, and sunny and
altogether lovely for a day or two now, and at night there is a broad
luminous highway stretching over the sea to the moon, over which the
spirits of the sea are traveling up and down all through the secret
night and having a genuine good time, I make no doubt.</p>
<p>Today they discovered a “collie“ on board! I find (as per
advertisement which I sent you) that they won’t carry dogs in these
ships at any price. This one has been concealed up to this time. Now his
owner has to pay L10 or heave him overboard. Fortunately the doggie is a
performing doggie and the money will be paid. So after all it was just
as well you didn’t intrust your collie to us.</p>
<p>A poor little child died at midnight and was buried at dawn this
morning –sheeted and shotted, and sunk in the middle of the lonely ocean
in water three thousand fathoms deep. Pity the poor mother. With our
love. S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Mark Twain was back in London, lecturing again at the Queen’s Concert
Rooms, after barely a month’s absence. Charles Warren Stoddard, whom he
had known in California, shared his apartment at the Langham, and acted
as his secretary–a very necessary office, for he was besieged by callers
and bombarded with letters.</p>
<p>He remained in London two months, lecturing steadily at Hanover
Square to full houses. It is unlikely that there is any other platform
record to match it. One letter of this period has been preserved. It is
written to Twichell, near the end of his engagement.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>LONDON, Jan. 5 1874. MY DEAR OLD JOE,–I knew you would be likely to
graduate into an ass if I came away; and so you have–if you have stopped
smoking. However, I have a strong faith that it is not too late, yet,
and that the judiciously managed influence of a bad example will fetch
you back again.</p>
<p>I wish you had written me some news–Livy tells me precious little.
She mainly writes to hurry me home and to tell me how much she respects
me: but she’s generally pretty slow on news. I had a letter from her
along with yours, today, but she didn’t tell me the book is out.
However, it’s all right. I hope to be home 20 days from today, and then
I’ll see her, and that will make up for a whole year’s dearth of news. I
am right down grateful that she is looking strong and “lovelier than
ever.“ I only wish I could see her look her level best, once–I think it
would be a vision.</p>
<p>I have just spent a good part of this day browsing through the Royal
Academy Exhibition of Landseer’s paintings. They fill four or five great
salons, and must number a good many hundreds. This is the only
opportunity ever to see them, because the finest of them belong to the
queen and she keeps them in her private apartments. Ah, they’re
wonderfully beautiful! There are such rich moonlights and dusks in “The
Challenge“ and “The Combat;“ and in that long flight of birds across a
lake in the subdued flush of sunset (or sunrise–for no man can ever tell
tother from which in a picture, except it has the filmy morning mist
breathing itself up from the water). And there is such a grave
analytical profundity in the faces of “The Connoisseurs;“ and such
pathos in the picture of the fawn suckling its dead mother, on a snowy
waste, with only the blood in the footprints to hint that she is not
asleep. And the way he makes animals absolute flesh and blood–insomuch
that if the room were darkened ever so little and a motionless living
animal placed beside a painted one, no man could tell which was
which.</p>
<p>I interrupted myself here, to drop a line to Shirley Brooks and
suggest a cartoon for Punch. It was this. In one of the Academy salons
(in the suite where these pictures are), a fine bust of Landseer stands
on a pedestal in the centre of the room. I suggest that some of
Landseer’s best known animals be represented as having come down out of
their frames in the moonlight and grouped themselves about the bust in
mourning attitudes.</p>
<p>Well, old man, I am powerful glad to hear from you and shall be
powerful glad to see you and Harmony. I am not going to the provinces
because I cannot get halls that are large enough. I always felt cramped
in Hanover Square Rooms, but I find that everybody here speaks with awe
and respect of that prodigious place, and wonder that I could fill it so
long.</p>
<p>I am hoping to be back in 20 days, but I have so much to go home to
and enjoy with a jubilant joy, that it seems hardly possible that it can
ever come to pass in so uncertain a world as this.</p>
<p>I have read the novel–[The Gilded Age, published during his absence,
December, 1873.]–here, and I like it. I have made no inquiries about it,
though. My interest in a book ceases with the printing of it. With a
world of love, SAML.</p>
