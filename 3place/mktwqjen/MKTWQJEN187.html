<h4 id="chapter-xliv.">CHAPTER XLIV.</h4>
<p>“It’s easy enough for another fellow to talk,“ said Harry,
despondingly, after he had put Philip in possession of his view of the
case. “It’s easy enough to say ‘give her up,’ if you don’t care for her.
What am I going to do to give her up?“</p>
<p>It seemed to Harry that it was a situation requiring some active
measures. He couldn’t realize that he had fallen hopelessly in love
without some rights accruing to him for the possession of the object of
his passion. Quiet resignation under relinquishment of any thing he
wanted was not in his line. And when it appeared to him that his
surrender of Laura would be the withdrawal of the one barrier that kept
her from ruin, it was unreasonable to expect that he could see how to
give her up.</p>
<p>Harry had the most buoyant confidence in his own projects always; he
saw everything connected with himself in a large way and in rosy lines.
This predominance of the imagination over the judgment gave that
appearance of exaggeration to his conversation and to his communications
with regard to himself, which sometimes conveyed the impression that he
was not speaking the truth. His acquaintances had been known to say that
they invariably allowed a half for shrinkage in his statements, and held
the other half under advisement for confirmation.</p>
<p>Philip in this case could not tell from Harry’s story exactly how
much encouragement Laura had given him, nor what hopes he might justly
have of winning her. He had never seen him desponding before. The “brag“
appeared to be all taken out of him, and his airy manner only asserted
itself now and then in a comical imitation of its old self.</p>
<p>Philip wanted time to look about him before he decided what to do. He
was not familiar with Washington, and it was difficult to adjust his
feelings and perceptions to its peculiarities. Coming out of the sweet
sanity of the Bolton household, this was by contrast the maddest Vanity
Fair one could conceive. It seemed to him a feverish, unhealthy
atmosphere in which lunacy would be easily developed. He fancied that
everybody attached to himself an exaggerated importance, from the fact
of being at the national capital, the center of political influence, the
fountain of patronage, preferment, jobs and opportunities.</p>
<p>People were introduced to each other as from this or that state, not
from cities or towns, and this gave a largeness to their representative
feeling. All the women talked politics as naturally and glibly as they
talk fashion or literature elsewhere. There was always some exciting
topic at the Capitol, or some huge slander was rising up like a
miasmatic exhalation from the Potomac, threatening to settle no one knew
exactly where. Every other person was an aspirant for a place, or, if he
had one, for a better place, or more pay; almost every other one had
some claim or interest or remedy to urge; even the women were all
advocates for the advancement of some person, and they violently
espoused or denounced this or that measure as it would affect some
relative, acquaintance or friend.</p>
<p>Love, travel, even death itself, waited on the chances of the dies
daily thrown in the two Houses, and the committee rooms there. If the
measure went through, love could afford to ripen into marriage, and
longing for foreign travel would have fruition; and it must have been
only eternal hope springing in the breast that kept alive numerous old
claimants who for years and years had besieged the doors of Congress,
and who looked as if they needed not so much an appropriation of money
as six feet of ground. And those who stood so long waiting for success
to bring them death were usually those who had a just claim.</p>
<p>Representing states and talking of national and even international
affairs, as familiarly as neighbors at home talk of poor crops and the
extravagance of their ministers, was likely at first to impose upon
Philip as to the importance of the people gathered here.</p>
<p>There was a little newspaper editor from Phil’s native town, the
assistant on a Peddletonian weekly, who made his little annual joke
about the “first egg laid on our table,“ and who was the menial of every
tradesman in the village and under bonds to him for frequent “puffs,“
except the undertaker, about whose employment he was recklessly
facetious. In Washington he was an important man, correspondent, and
clerk of two house committees, a “worker“ in politics, and a confident
critic of every woman and every man in Washington. He would be a consul
no doubt by and by, at some foreign port, of the language of which he
was ignorant–though if ignorance of language were a qualification he
might have been a consul at home. His easy familiarity with great men
was beautiful to see, and when Philip learned what a tremendous
underground influence this little ignoramus had, he no longer wondered
at the queer appointments and the queerer legislation.</p>
<p>Philip was not long in discovering that people in Washington did not
differ much from other people; they had the same meannesses,
generosities, and tastes: A Washington boarding house had the odor of a
boarding house the world over.</p>
<p>Col. Sellers was as unchanged as any one Philip saw whom he had known
elsewhere. Washington appeared to be the native element of this man. His
pretentions were equal to any he encountered there. He saw nothing in
its society that equalled that of Hawkeye, he sat down to no table that
could not be unfavorably contrasted with his own at home; the most airy
scheme inflated in the hot air of the capital only reached in magnitude
some of his lesser fancies, the by-play of his constructive
imagination.</p>
<p>“The country is getting along very well,“ he said to Philip, “but our
public men are too timid. What we want is more money. I’ve told Boutwell
so. Talk about basing the currency on gold; you might as well base it on
pork. Gold is only one product. Base it on everything! You’ve got to do
something for the West. How am I to move my crops? We must have
improvements. Grant’s got the idea. We want a canal from the James River
to the Mississippi. Government ought to build it.“</p>
<p>It was difficult to get the Colonel off from these large themes when
he was once started, but Philip brought the conversation round to Laura
and her reputation in the City.</p>
<p>“No,“ he said, “I haven’t noticed much. We’ve been so busy about this
University. It will make Laura rich with the rest of us, and she has
done nearly as much as if she were a man. She has great talent, and will
make a big match. I see the foreign ministers and that sort after her.
Yes, there is talk, always will be about a pretty woman so much in
public as she is. Tough stories come to me, but I put’em away. ’Taint
likely one of Si Hawkins’s children would do that–for she is the same as
a child of his. I told her, though, to go slow,“ added the Colonel, as
if that mysterious admonition from him would set everything right.</p>
<p>“Do you know anything about a Col. Selby?“</p>
<p>“Know all about him. Fine fellow. But he’s got a wife; and I told
him, as a friend, he’d better sheer off from Laura. I reckon he thought
better of it and did.“</p>
<p>But Philip was not long in learning the truth. Courted as Laura was
by a certain class and still admitted into society, that, nevertheless,
buzzed with disreputable stories about her, she had lost character with
the best people. Her intimacy with Selby was open gossip, and there were
winks and thrustings of the tongue in any group of men when she passed
by. It was clear enough that Harry’s delusion must be broken up, and
that no such feeble obstacle as his passion could interpose would turn
Laura from her fate. Philip determined to see her, and put himself in
possession of the truth, as he suspected it, in order to show Harry his
folly.</p>
<p>Laura, after her last conversation with Harry, had a new sense of her
position. She had noticed before the signs of a change in manner towards
her, a little less respect perhaps from men, and an avoidance by women.
She had attributed this latter partly to jealousy of her, for no one is
willing to acknowledge a fault in himself when a more agreeable motive
can be found for the estrangement of his acquaintances. But now, if
society had turned on her, she would defy it. It was not in her nature
to shrink. She knew she had been wronged, and she knew that she had no
remedy.</p>
<p>What she heard of Col. Selby’s proposed departure alarmed her more
than anything else, and she calmly determined that if he was deceiving
her the second time it should be the last. Let society finish the
tragedy if it liked; she was indifferent what came after. At the first
opportunity, she charged Selby with his intention to abandon her. He
unblushingly denied it.</p>
<p>He had not thought of going to Europe. He had only been amusing
himself with Sellers’ schemes. He swore that as soon as she succeeded
with her bill, he would fly with her to any part of the world.</p>
<p>She did not quite believe him, for she saw that he feared her, and
she began to suspect that his were the protestations of a coward to gain
time. But she showed him no doubts.</p>
<p>She only watched his movements day by day, and always held herself
ready to act promptly.</p>
<p>When Philip came into the presence of this attractive woman, he could
not realize that she was the subject of all the scandal he had heard.
She received him with quite the old Hawkeye openness and cordiality, and
fell to talking at once of their little acquaintance there; and it
seemed impossible that he could ever say to her what he had come
determined to say. Such a man as Philip has only one standard by which
to judge women.</p>
<p>Laura recognized that fact no doubt. The better part of her woman’s
nature saw it. Such a man might, years ago, not now, have changed her
nature, and made the issue of her life so different, even after her
cruel abandonment. She had a dim feeling of this, and she would like now
to stand well with him. The spark of truth and honor that was left in
her was elicited by his presence. It was this influence that governed
her conduct in this interview.</p>
<p>“I have come,“ said Philip in his direct manner, “from my friend
Mr. Brierly. You are not ignorant of his feeling towards you?“</p>
<p>“Perhaps not.“</p>
<p>“But perhaps you do not know, you who have so much admiration, how
sincere and overmastering his love is for you?“ Philip would not have
spoken so plainly, if he had in mind anything except to draw from Laura
something that would end Harry’s passion.</p>
<p>“And is sincere love so rare, Mr. Sterling?“ asked Laura, moving her
foot a little, and speaking with a shade of sarcasm.</p>
<p>“Perhaps not in Washington,“ replied Philip,–tempted into a similar
tone. “Excuse my bluntness,“ he continued, “but would the knowledge of
his love; would his devotion, make any difference to you in your
Washington life?“</p>
<p>“In respect to what?“ asked Laura quickly.</p>
<p>“Well, to others. I won’t equivocate–to Col. Selby?“</p>
<p>Laura’s face flushed with anger, or shame; she looked steadily at
Philip and began,</p>
<p>“By what right, sir,–“</p>
<p>“By the right of friendship,“ interrupted Philip stoutly. “It may
matter little to you. It is everything to him. He has a Quixotic notion
that you would turn back from what is before you for his sake. You
cannot be ignorant of what all the city is talking of.“ Philip said this
determinedly and with some bitterness.</p>
<p>It was a full minute before Laura spoke. Both had risen, Philip as if
to go, and Laura in suppressed excitement. When she spoke her voice was
very unsteady, and she looked down.</p>
<p>“Yes, I know. I perfectly understand what you mean. Mr. Brierly is
nothing–simply nothing. He is a moth singed, that is all–the trifler
with women thought he was a wasp. I have no pity for him, not the least.
You may tell him not to make a fool of himself, and to keep away. I say
this on your account, not his. You are not like him. It is enough for me
that you want it so. Mr. Sterling,“ she continued, looking up; and there
were tears in her eyes that contradicted the hardness of her language,
“you might not pity him if you knew my history; perhaps you would not
wonder at some things you hear. No; it is useless to ask me why it must
be so. You can’t make a life over–society wouldn’t let you if you
would–and mine must be lived as it is. There, sir, I’m not offended; but
it is useless for you to say anything more.“</p>
<p>Philip went away with his heart lightened about Harry, but profoundly
saddened by the glimpse of what this woman might have been. He told
Harry all that was necessary of the conversation–she was bent on going
her own way, he had not the ghost of a chance–he was a fool, she had
said, for thinking he had.</p>
<p>And Harry accepted it meekly, and made up his own mind that Philip
didn’t know much about women.</p>
