<h4 id="chapter-xv.">CHAPTER XV.</h4>
<p>Truth is stranger than fiction–to some people, but I am measurably
familiar with it. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged
to stick to possibilities; Truth isn’t. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New
Calendar.</p>
<p>The air was balmy and delicious, the sunshine radiant; it was a
charming excursion. In the course of it we came to a town whose odd name
was famous all over the world a quarter of a century ago–Wagga-Wagga.
This was because the Tichborne Claimant had kept a butcher-shop there.
It was out of the midst of his humble collection of sausages and tripe
that he soared up into the zenith of notoriety and hung there in the
wastes of space a time, with the telescopes of all nations leveled at
him in unappeasable curiosity–curiosity as to which of the two
long-missing persons he was: Arthur Orton, the mislaid roustabout of
Wapping, or Sir Roger Tichborne, the lost heir of a name and estates as
old as English history. We all know now, but not a dozen people knew
then; and the dozen kept the mystery to themselves and allowed the most
intricate and fascinating and marvelous real-life romance that has ever
been played upon the world’s stage to unfold itself serenely, act by
act, in a British court by the long and laborious processes of judicial
development.</p>
<p>When we recall the details of that great romance we marvel to see
what daring chances truth may freely take in constructing a tale, as
compared with the poor little conservative risks permitted to fiction.
The fiction-artist could achieve no success with the materials of this
splendid Tichborne romance.</p>
<p>He would have to drop out the chief characters; the public would say
such people are impossible. He would have to drop out a number of the
most picturesque incidents; the public would say such things could never
happen. And yet the chief characters did exist, and the incidents did
happen.</p>
<p>It cost the Tichborne estates 00,000 to unmask the Claimant and drive
him out; and even after the exposure multitudes of Englishmen still
believed in him. It cost the British Government another 00,000 to
convict him of perjury; and after the conviction the same old multitudes
still believed in him; and among these believers were many educated and
intelligent men; and some of them had personally known the real Sir
Roger. The Claimant was sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment. When he got
out of prison he went to New York and kept a whisky saloon in the Bowery
for a time, then disappeared from view.</p>
<p>He always claimed to be Sir Roger Tichborne until death called for
him. This was but a few months ago–not very much short of a generation
since he left Wagga-Wagga to go and possess himself of his estates. On
his death-bed he yielded up his secret, and confessed in writing that he
was only Arthur Orton of Wapping, able seaman and butcher–that and
nothing more. But it is scarcely to be doubted that there are people
whom even his dying confession will not convince. The old habit of
assimilating incredibilities must have made strong food a necessity in
their case; a weaker article would probably disagree with them.</p>
<p>I was in London when the Claimant stood his trial for perjury. I
attended one of his showy evenings in the sumptuous quarters provided
for him from the purses of his adherents and well-wishers. He was in
evening dress, and I thought him a rather fine and stately creature.
There were about twenty-five gentlemen present; educated men, men moving
in good society, none of them commonplace; some of them were men of
distinction, none of them were obscurities. They were his cordial
friends and admirers. It was “Sir Roger,“ always “Sir Roger,“ on all
hands; no one withheld the title, all turned it from the tongue with
unction, and as if it tasted good.</p>
<p>For many years I had had a mystery in stock. Melbourne, and only
Melbourne, could unriddle it for me. In 1873 I arrived in London with my
wife and young child, and presently received a note from Naples signed
by a name not familiar to me. It was not Bascom, and it was not Henry;
but I will call it Henry Bascom for convenience’s sake. This note, of
about six lines, was written on a strip of white paper whose end-edges
were ragged. I came to be familiar with those strips in later years.
Their size and pattern were always the same. Their contents were usually
to the same effect: would I and mine come to the writer’s country-place
in England on such and such a date, by such and such a train, and stay
twelve days and depart by such and such a train at the end of the
specified time? A carriage would meet us at the station.</p>
<p>These invitations were always for a long time ahead; if we were in
Europe, three months ahead; if we were in America, six to twelve months
ahead. They always named the exact date and train for the beginning and
also for the end of the visit.</p>
<p>This first note invited us for a date three months in the future. It
asked us to arrive by the 4.10 p.m. train from London, August 6th. The
carriage would be waiting. The carriage would take us away seven days
later-train specified. And there were these words: “Speak to Tom
Hughes.“</p>
<p>I showed the note to the author of “Tom Brown at Rugby,“ and be said:
“Accept, and be thankful.“</p>
<p>He described Mr. Bascom as being a man of genius, a man of fine
attainments, a choice man in every way, a rare and beautiful character.
He said that Bascom Hall was a particularly fine example of the stately
manorial mansion of Elizabeth’s days, and that it was a house worth
going a long way to see–like Knowle; that Mr. B. was of a social
disposition; liked the company of agreeable people, and always had
samples of the sort coming and going.</p>
<p>We paid the visit. We paid others, in later years–the last one in
1879. Soon after that Mr. Bascom started on a voyage around the world in
a steam yacht–a long and leisurely trip, for he was making collections,
in all lands, of birds, butterflies, and such things.</p>
<p>The day that President Garfield was shot by the assassin Guiteau, we
were at a little watering place on Long Island Sound; and in the mail
matter of that day came a letter with the Melbourne post-mark on it. It
was for my wife, but I recognized Mr. Bascom’s handwriting on the
envelope, and opened it. It was the usual note–as to paucity of
lines–and was written on the customary strip of paper; but there was
nothing usual about the contents. The note informed my wife that if it
would be any assuagement of her grief to know that her husband’s
lecture-tour in Australia was a satisfactory venture from the beginning
to the end, he, the writer, could testify that such was the case; also,
that her husband’s untimely death had been mourned by all classes, as
she would already know by the press telegrams, long before the reception
of this note; that the funeral was attended by the officials of the
colonial and city governments; and that while he, the writer, her friend
and mine, had not reached Melbourne in time to see the body, he had at
least had the sad privilege of acting as one of the pall-bearers.
Signed, “Henry Bascom.“</p>
<p>My first thought was, why didn’t he have the coffin opened? He would
have seen that the corpse was an imposter, and he could have gone right
ahead and dried up the most of those tears, and comforted those
sorrowing governments, and sold the remains and sent me the money.</p>
<p>I did nothing about the matter. I had set the law after living
lecture doubles of mine a couple of times in America, and the law had
not been able to catch them; others in my trade had tried to catch their
impostor-doubles and had failed. Then where was the use in harrying a
ghost? None–and so I did not disturb it. I had a curiosity to know about
that man’s lecture-tour and last moments, but that could wait. When I
should see Mr. Bascom he would tell me all about it. But he passed from
life, and I never saw him again.. My curiosity faded away.</p>
<p>However, when I found that I was going to Australia it revived. And
naturally: for if the people should say that I was a dull, poor thing
compared to what I was before I died, it would have a bad effect on
business. Well, to my surprise the Sydney journalists had never heard of
that impostor! I pressed them, but they were firm–they had never heard
of him, and didn’t believe in him.</p>
<p>I could not understand it; still, I thought it would all come right
in Melbourne. The government would remember; and the other mourners. At
the supper of the Institute of Journalists I should find out all about
the matter. But no–it turned out that they had never heard of it.</p>
<p>So my mystery was a mystery still. It was a great disappointment. I
believed it would never be cleared up–in this life–so I dropped it out
of my mind.</p>
<p>But at last! just when I was least expecting it—-</p>
<p>However, this is not the place for the rest of it; I shall come to
the matter again, in a far-distant chapter.</p>
