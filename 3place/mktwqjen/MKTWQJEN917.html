FROM EUROPE, 1878-79. TRAMPING WITH TWICHELL. WRITING A NEW TRAVEL BOOK.
LIFE IN MUNICH</h4>
<p>Whether the unhappy occurrence at the Whittier dinner had anything to
do with Mark Twain’s resolve to spend a year or two in Europe cannot be
known now. There were other good reasons for going, one in particular
being a demand for another book of travel. It was also true, as he
explains in a letter to his mother, that his days were full of
annoyances, making it difficult for him to work. He had a tendency to
invest money in almost any glittering enterprise that came along, and at
this time he was involved in the promotion of a variety of patent rights
that brought him no return other than assessment and vexation.</p>
<p>Clemens’s mother was by this time living with her son Onion and his
wife, in Iowa.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens, in Keokuk, Iowa:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Feb. 17, 1878 MY DEAR MOTHER,–I suppose I am the worst
correspondent in the whole world; and yet I grow worse and worse all the
time. My conscience blisters me for not writing you, but it has ceased
to abuse me for not writing other folks.</p>
<p>Life has come to be a very serious matter with me. I have a badgered,
harassed feeling, a good part of my time. It comes mainly of business
responsibilities and annoyances, and the persecution of kindly letters
from well meaning strangers–to whom I must be rudely silent or else put
in the biggest half of my time bothering over answers. There are other
things also that help to consume my time and defeat my projects. Well,
the consequence is, I cannot write a book at home. This cuts my income
down. Therefore, I have about made up my mind to take my tribe and fly
to some little corner of Europe and budge no more until I shall have
completed one of the half dozen books that lie begun, up stairs. Please
say nothing about this at present.</p>
<p>We propose to sail the 11th of April. I shall go to Fredonia to meet
you, but it will not be well for Livy to make that trip I am afraid.
However, we shall see. I will hope she can go.</p>
<p>Mr. Twichell has just come in, so I must go to him. We are all well,
and send love to you all. Affly, SAM.</p>
<p>He was writing few letters at this time, and doing but little work.
There were always many social events during the winter, and what with
his European plans and a diligent study of the German language, which
the entire family undertook, his days and evenings were full enough.
Howells wrote protesting against the European travel and berating him
for his silence:</p>
<p>“I never was in Berlin and don’t know any family hotel there. I
should be glad I didn’t, if it would keep you from going. You deserve to
put up at the Sign of the Savage in Vienna. Really, it’s a great blow to
me to hear of that prospected sojourn. It’s a shame. I must see you,
somehow, before you go. I’m in dreadfully low spirits about it.</p>
<p>“I was afraid your silence meant something wicked.“</p>
<p>Clemens replied promptly, urging a visit to Hartford, adding a
postscript for Mrs. Howells, characteristic enough to warrant
preservation.</p>
<p>P. S. to Mrs. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>Feb. ’78. DEAR MRS. HOWELLS. Mrs. Clemens wrote you a letter, and
handed it to me half an hour ago, while I was folding mine to
Mr. Howells. I laid that letter on this table before me while I added
the paragraph about R,’s application. Since then I have been hunting and
swearing, and swearing and hunting, but I can’t find a sign of that
letter. It is the most astonishing disappearance I ever heard of.
Mrs. Clemens has gone off driving–so I will have to try and give you an
idea of her communication from memory. Mainly it consisted of an urgent
desire that you come to see us next week, if you can possibly manage it,
for that will be a reposeful time, the turmoil of breaking up beginning
the week after. She wants you to tell her about Italy, and advise her in
that connection, if you will. Then she spoke of her plans–hers, mind
you, for I never have anything quite so definite as a plan. She proposes
to stop a fortnight in (confound the place, I’ve forgotten what it was,)
then go and live in Dresden till sometime in the summer; then retire to
Switzerland for the hottest season, then stay a while in Venice and put
in the winter in Munich. This program subject to modifications according
to circumstances. She said something about some little by-trips here and
there, but they didn’t stick in my memory because the idea didn’t charm
me.</p>
<p>(They have just telephoned me from the Courant office that Bayard
Taylor and family have taken rooms in our ship, the Holsatia, for the
11th April.)</p>
<p>Do come, if you possibly can!–and remember and don’t forget to avoid
letting Mrs. Clemens find out I lost her letter. Just answer her the
same as if you had got it. Sincerely yours S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The Howellses came, as invited, for a final reunion before the
breaking up. This was in the early half of March; the Clemenses were to
sail on the 11th of the following month.</p>
<p>Orion Clemens, meantime, had conceived a new literary idea and was
piling in his MS. as fast as possible to get his brother’s judgment on
it before the sailing-date. It was not a very good time to send MS., but
Mark Twain seems to have read it and given it some consideration. “The
Journey in Heaven,“ of his own, which he mentions, was the story
published so many years later under the title of “Captain Stormfield’s
Visit to Heaven.“ He had began it in 1868, on his voyage to San
Francisco, it having been suggested by conversations with Capt. Ned
Wakeman, of one of the Pacific steamers. Wakeman also appears in
‘Roughing It,’ Chap. L, as Capt. Ned Blakely, and again in one of the
“Rambling Notes of an Idle Excursion,“ as “Captain Hurricane Jones.“</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in Keokuk:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Mch. 23, 1878. MY DEAR BRO.,–Every man must learn his
trade–not pick it up. God requires that he learn it by slow and painful
processes. The apprentice-hand, in black-smithing, in medicine, in
literature, in everything, is a thing that can’t be hidden. It always
shows.</p>
<p>But happily there is a market for apprentice work, else the
“Innocents Abroad“ would have had no sale. Happily, too, there’s a wider
market for some sorts of apprentice literature than there is for the
very best of journey-work. This work of yours is exceedingly crude, but
I am free to say it is less crude than I expected it to be, and
considerably better work than I believed you could do, it is too crude
to offer to any prominent periodical, so I shall speak to the N. Y.
Weekly people. To publish it there will be to bury it. Why could not
same good genius have sent me to the N. Y. Weekly with my apprentice
sketches?</p>
<p>You should not publish it in book form at all–for this reason: it is
only an imitation of Verne–it is not a burlesque. But I think it may be
regarded as proof that Verne cannot be burlesqued.</p>
<p>In accompanying notes I have suggested that you vastly modify the
first visit to hell, and leave out the second visit altogether. Nobody
would, or ought to print those things. You are not advanced enough in
literature to venture upon a matter requiring so much practice. Let me
show you what a man has got to go through:</p>
<p>Nine years ago I mapped out my “Journey in Heaven.“ I discussed it
with literary friends whom I could trust to keep it to themselves.</p>
<p>I gave it a deal of thought, from time to time. After a year or more
I wrote it up. It was not a success. Five years ago I wrote it again,
altering the plan. That MS is at my elbow now. It was a considerable
improvement on the first attempt, but still it wouldn’t do–last year and
year before I talked frequently with Howells about the subject, and he
kept urging me to do it again.</p>
<p>So I thought and thought, at odd moments and at last I struck what I
considered to be the right plan! Mind I have never altered the ideas,
from the first–the plan was the difficulty. When Howells was here last,
I laid before him the whole story without referring to my MS and he
said: “You have got it sure this time. But drop the idea of making mere
magazine stuff of it. Don’t waste it. Print it by itself–publish it
first in England–ask Dean Stanley to endorse it, which will draw some of
the teeth of the religious press, and then reprint in America.“ I doubt
my ability to get Dean Stanley to do anything of the sort, but I shall
do the rest–and this is all a secret which you must not divulge.</p>
<p>Now look here–I have tried, all these years, to think of some way of
“doing“ hell too–and have always had to give it up. Hell, in my book,
will not occupy five pages of MS I judge–it will be only covert hints, I
suppose, and quickly dropped, I may end by not even referring to it.</p>
<p>And mind you, in my opinion you will find that you can’t write up
hell so it will stand printing. Neither Howells nor I believe in hell or
the divinity of the Savior, but no matter, the Savior is none the less a
sacred Personage, and a man should have no desire or disposition to
refer to him lightly, profanely, or otherwise than with the profoundest
reverence.</p>
<p>The only safe thing is not to introduce him, or refer to him at all,
I suspect. I have entirely rewritten one book 3 (perhaps 4.) times,
changing the plan every time–1200 pages of MS. wasted and burned–and
shall tackle it again, one of these years and maybe succeed at last.
Therefore you need not expect to get your book right the first time. Go
to work and revamp or rewrite it. God only exhibits his thunder and
lightning at intervals, and so they always command attention. These are
God’s adjectives. You thunder and lightning too much; the reader ceases
to get under the bed, by and by.</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins will send you and Ma your checks when we are gone. But
don’t write him, ever, except a single line in case he forgets the
checks–for the man is driven to death with work.</p>
<p>I see you are half promising yourself a monthly return for your book.
In my experience, previously counted chickens never do hatch. How many
of mine I have counted! and never a one of them but failed! It is much
better to hedge disappointment by not counting.–Unexpected money is a
delight. The same sum is a bitterness when you expected more.</p>
<p>My time in America is growing mighty short. Perhaps we can manage in
this way: Imprimis, if the N. Y. Weekly people know that you are my
brother, they will turn that fact into an advertisement–a thing of value
to them, but not to you and me. This must be prevented. I will write
them a note to say you have a friend near Keokuk, Charles S. Miller, who
has a MS for sale which you think is a pretty clever travesty on Verne;
and if they want it they might write to him in your care. Then if any
correspondence ensues between you and them, let Mollie write for you and
sign your name–your own hand writing representing Miller’s. Keep
yourself out of sight till you make a strike on your own merits there is
no other way to get a fair verdict upon your merits.</p>
<p>Later-I’ve written the note to Smith, and with nothing in it which he
can use as an advertisement. I’m called–Good bye-love to you both.</p>
<p>We leave here next Wednesday for Elmira: we leave there Apl. 9 or
10–and sail 11th Yr Bro. SAM.</p>
<p>In the letter that follows the mention of Annie and Sam refers, of
course, to the children of Mrs. Moffett, who had been, Pamela Clemens.
They were grown now, and Annie Moffett was married to Charles L.
Webster, who later was to become Mark Twain’s business partner. The
Moffetts and Websters were living in Fredonia at this time, and Clemens
had been to pay them a good-by visit. The Taylor dinner mentioned was a
farewell banquet given to Bayard Taylor, who had been appointed Minister
to Germany, and was to sail on the ship with Mark Twain. Mark Twain’s
mother was visiting in Fredonia when this letter was written.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens, in Fredonia:</p>
<p>Apr. 7, ’78. MY DEAR MOTHER,–I have told Livy all about Annie’s
beautiful house, and about Sam and Charley, and about Charley’s
ingenious manufactures and his strong manhood and good promise, and how
glad I am that he and Annie married. And I have told her about Annie’s
excellent house-keeping, also about the great Bacon conflict; (I told
you it was a hundred to one that neither Livy nor the European powers
had heard of that desolating struggle.)</p>
<p>And I have told her how beautiful you are in your age and how bright
your mind is with its old-time brightness, and how she and the children
would enjoy you. And I have told her how singularly young Pamela is
looking, and what a fine large fellow Sam is, and how ill the lingering
syllable “my“ to his name fits his port and figure.</p>
<p>Well, Pamela, after thinking it over for a day or so, I came near
inquiring about a state-room in our ship for Sam, to please you, but my
wiser former resolution came back to me. It is not for his good that he
have friends in the ship. His conduct in the Bacon business shows that
he will develop rapidly into a manly man as soon as he is cast loose
from your apron strings.</p>
<p>You don’t teach him to push ahead and do and dare things for himself,
but you do just the reverse. You are assisted in your damaging work by
the tyrannous ways of a village–villagers watch each other and so make
cowards of each other. After Sam shall have voyaged to Europe by
himself, and rubbed against the world and taken and returned its cuffs,
do you think he will hesitate to escort a guest into any whisky-mill in
Fredonia when he himself has no sinful business to transact there? No,
he will smile at the idea. If he avoids this courtesy now from
principle, of course I find no fault with it at all–only if he thinks it
is principle he may be mistaken; a close examination may show it is only
a bowing to the tyranny of public opinion.</p>
<p>I only say it may–I cannot venture to say it will. Hartford is not a
large place, but it is broader than to have ways of that sort. Three or
four weeks ago, at a Moody and Sankey meeting, the preacher read a
letter from somebody “exposing“ the fact that a prominent clergyman had
gone from one of those meetings, bought a bottle of lager beer and drank
it on the premises (a drug store.)</p>
<p>A tempest of indignation swept the town. Our clergymen and everybody
else said the “culprit“ had not only done an innocent thing, but had
done it in an open, manly way, and it was nobody’s right or business to
find fault with it. Perhaps this dangerous latitude comes of the fact
that we never have any temperance “rot“ going on in Hartford.</p>
<p>I find here a letter from Orion, submitting some new matter in his
story for criticism. When you write him, please tell him to do the best
he can and bang away. I can do nothing further in this matter, for I
have but 3 days left in which to settle a deal of important business and
answer a bushel and a half of letters. I am very nearly tired to
death.</p>
<p>I was so jaded and worn, at the Taylor dinner, that I found I could
not remember 3 sentences of the speech I had memorized, and therefore
got up and said so and excused myself from speaking. I arrived here at 3
o’clock this morning. I think the next 3 days will finish me. The idea
of sitting down to a job of literary criticism is simply ludicrous.</p>
<p>A young lady passenger in our ship has been placed under Livy’s
charge. Livy couldn’t easily get out of it, and did not want to, on her
own account, but fully expected I would make trouble when I heard of it.
But I didn’t. A girl can’t well travel alone, so I offered no objection.
She leaves us at Hamburg. So I’ve got 6 people in my care, now–which is
just 6 too many for a man of my unexecutive capacity. I expect nothing
else but to lose some of them overboard.</p>
<p>We send our loving good-byes to all the household and hope to see you
again after a spell. Affly Yrs. SAM.</p>
<p>There are no other American letters of this period. The Clemens
party, which included Miss Clara Spaulding, of Elmira, sailed as
planned, on the Holsatia, April 11, 1878. As before stated, Bayard
Taylor was on the ship; also Murat Halstead and family. On the eve of
departure, Clemens sent to Howells this farewell word:</p>
<p>“And that reminds me, ungrateful dog that I am, that I owe as much to
your training as the rude country job-printer owes to the city boss who
takes him in hand and teaches him the right way to handle his art. I was
talking to Mrs. Clemens about this the other day, and grieving because I
never mentioned it to you, thereby seeming to ignore it, or to be
unaware of it. Nothing that has passed under your eye needs any revision
before going into a volume, while all my other stuff does need so
much.“</p>
<p>A characteristic tribute, and from the heart.</p>
<p>The first European letter came from Frankfort, a rest on their way to
Heidelberg.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>FRANKFORT ON THE MAIN, May 4, 1878. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I only propose
to write a single line to say we are still around. Ah, I have such a
deep, grateful, unutterable sense of being “out of it all.“ I think I
foretaste some of the advantages of being dead. Some of the joy of it. I
don’t read any newspapers or care for them. When people tell me England
has declared war, I drop the subject, feeling that it is none of my
business; when they tell me Mrs. Tilton has confessed and Mr. B. denied,
I say both of them have done that before, therefore let the worn stub of
the Plymouth white-wash brush be brought out once more, and let the
faithful spit on their hands and get to work again regardless of me–for
I am out of it all.</p>
<p>We had 2 almost devilish weeks at sea (and I tell you Bayard Taylor
is a really lovable man–which you already knew) then we staid a week in
the beautiful, the very beautiful city of Hamburg; and since then we
have been fooling along, 4 hours per day by rail, with a courier,
spending the other 20 in hotels whose enormous bedchambers and private
parlors are an overpowering marvel to me: Day before yesterday, in
Cassel, we had a love of a bedroom ,31 feet long, and a parlor with 2
sofas, 12 chairs, a writing desk and 4 tables scattered around, here and
there in it. Made of red silk, too, by George.</p>
<p>The times and times I wish you were along! You could throw some fun
into the journey; whereas I go on, day by day, in a smileless state of
solemn admiration.</p>
<p>What a paradise this is! What clean clothes, what good faces, what
tranquil contentment, what prosperity, what genuine freedom, what superb
government. And I am so happy, for I am responsible for none of it. I am
only here to enjoy. How charmed I am when I overhear a German word which
I understand. With love from us 2 to you 2.</p>
<p>MARK.</p>
<p>P. S. We are not taking six days to go from Hamburg to Heidelberg
because we prefer it. Quite on the contrary. Mrs. Clemens picked up a
dreadful cold and sore throat on board ship and still keeps them in
stock–so she could only travel 4 hours a day. She wanted to dive
straight through, but I had different notions about the wisdom of it. I
found that 4 hours a day was the best she could do. Before I forget it,
our permanent address is Care Messrs. Koester andandandand Co., Backers,
Heidelberg. We go there tomorrow.</p>
<p>Poor Susy! From the day we reached German soil, we have required Rosa
to speak German to the children–which they hate with all their souls.
The other morning in Hanover, Susy came to us (from Rosa, in the
nursery) and said, in halting syllables, “Papa, vie viel uhr ist
es?“–then turned with pathos in her big eyes, and said, “Mamma, I wish
Rosa was made in English.“</p>
<p>(Unfinished)</p>
<p>Frankfort was a brief halting-place, their destination being
Heidelberg. They were presently located there in the beautiful Schloss
hotel, which overlooks the old castle with its forest setting, the
flowing Neckar, and the distant valley of the Rhine. Clemens, who had
discovered the location, and loved it, toward the end of May reported to
Howells his felicities.</p>
<p>Part of letter to W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>SCHLOSS-HOTEL HEIDELBERG, Sunday, a. m., May 26, 1878. MY DEAR
HOWELLS,–….divinely located. From this airy porch among the shining
groves we look down upon Heidelberg Castle, and upon the swift Neckar,
and the town, and out over the wide green level of the Rhine valley–a
marvelous prospect. We are in a Cul-de-sac formed of hill-ranges and
river; we are on the side of a steep mountain; the river at our feet is
walled, on its other side, (yes, on both sides,) by a steep and wooded
mountain-range which rises abruptly aloft from the water’s edge;
portions of these mountains are densely wooded; the plain of the Rhine,
seen through the mouth of this pocket, has many and peculiar charms for
the eye.</p>
<p>Our bedroom has two great glass bird-cages (enclosed balconies) one
looking toward the Rhine valley and sunset, the other looking up the
Neckar cul-de-sac, and naturally we spend nearly all our time in these
–when one is sunny the other is shady. We have tables and chairs in
them; we do our reading, writing, studying, smoking and suppering in
them.</p>
<p>The view from these bird-cages is my despair. The pictures change
from one enchanting aspect to another in ceaseless procession, never
keeping one form half an hour, and never taking on an unlovely one.</p>
<p>And then Heidelberg on a dark night! It is massed, away down there,
almost right under us, you know, and stretches off toward the valley.
Its curved and interlacing streets are a cobweb, beaded thick with
lights–a wonderful thing to see; then the rows of lights on the arched
bridges, and their glinting reflections in the water; and away at the
far end, the Eisenbahnhof, with its twenty solid acres of glittering
gas-jets, a huge garden, as one may say, whose every plant is a
flame.</p>
<p>These balconies are the darlingest things. I have spent all the
morning in this north one. Counting big and little, it has 256 panes of
glass in it; so one is in effect right out in the free sunshine, and yet
sheltered from wind and rain–and likewise doored and curtained from
whatever may be going on in the bedroom. It must have been a noble
genius who devised this hotel. Lord, how blessed is the repose, the
tranquillity of this place! Only two sounds; the happy clamor of the
birds in the groves, and the muffled music of the Neckar, tumbling over
the opposing dykes. It is no hardship to lie awake awhile, nights, for
this subdued roar has exactly the sound of a steady rain beating upon a
roof. It is so healing to the spirit; and it bears up the thread of
one’s imaginings as the accompaniment bears up a song.</p>
<p>While Livy and Miss Spaulding have been writing at this table, I have
sat tilted back, near by, with a pipe and the last Atlantic, and read
Charley Warner’s article with prodigious enjoyment. I think it is
exquisite. I think it must be the roundest and broadest and completest
short essay he has ever written. It is clear, and compact, and
charmingly done.</p>
<p>The hotel grounds join and communicate with the Castle grounds; so we
and the children loaf in the winding paths of those leafy vastnesses a
great deal, and drink beer and listen to excellent music.</p>
<p>When we first came to this hotel, a couple of weeks ago, I pointed to
a house across the river, and said I meant to rent the centre room on
the 3d floor for a work-room. Jokingly we got to speaking of it as my
office; and amused ourselves with watching “my people“ daily in their
small grounds and trying to make out what we could of their dress,
andandandandc., without a glass. Well, I loafed along there one day and
found on that house the only sign of the kind on that side of the river:
“Moblirte Wohnung zu Vermiethen!“ I went in and rented that very room
which I had long ago selected. There was only one other room in the
whole double-house unrented.</p>
<p>(It occurs to me that I made a great mistake in not thinking to
deliver a very bad German speech, every other sentence pieced out with
English, at the Bayard Taylor banquet in New York. I think I could have
made it one of the features of the occasion.)–[He used this plan at a
gathering of the American students in Heidelberg, on July 4th, with
great effect; so his idea was not wasted.]</p>
<p>We left Hartford before the end of March, and I have been idle ever
since. I have waited for a call to go to work–I knew it would come.
Well, it began to come a week ago; my note-book comes out more and more
frequently every day since; 3 days ago I concluded to move my manuscript
over to my den. Now the call is loud and decided at last. So tomorrow I
shall begin regular, steady work, and stick to it till middle of July or
1st August, when I look for Twichell; we will then walk about Germany 2
or 3 weeks, and then I’ll go to work again–(perhaps in Munich.)</p>
<p>We both send a power of love to the Howellses, and we do wish you
were here. Are you in the new house? Tell us about it. Yrs Ever
MARK.</p>
<p>There has been no former mention in the letters of the coming of
Twichell; yet this had been a part of the European plan. Mark Twain had
invited his walking companion to make a tramp with him through Europe,
as his guest. Material for the new book would grow faster with Twichell
as a companion; and these two in spite of their widely opposed views
concerning Providence and the general scheme of creation, were wholly
congenial comrades. Twichell, in Hartford, expecting to receive the
final summons to start, wrote: “Oh, my! do you realize, Mark, what a
symposium it is to be? I do. To begin with, I am thoroughly tired, and
the rest will be worth everything. To walk with you and talk with you
for weeks together–why, it’s my dream of luxury.“</p>
<p>August 1st brought Twichell, and the friends set out without delay on
a tramp through the Black Forest, making short excursions at first, but
presently extending them in the direction of Switzerland. Mrs. Clemens
and the others remained in Heidelberg, to follow at their leisure. To
Mrs. Clemens her husband sent frequent reports of their wanderings. It
will be seen that their tramp did not confine itself to pedestrianism,
though they did, in fact, walk a great deal, and Mark Twain in a note to
his mother declared, “I loathe all travel, except on foot.“ The reports
to Mrs. Clemens follow:</p>
