<h4 id="chapter-xxxvii.">CHAPTER XXXVII.</h4>
<p>It was somewhere in the neighborhood of Mono Lake that the marvellous
Whiteman cement mine was supposed to lie. Every now and then it would be
reported that Mr. W. had passed stealthily through Esmeralda at dead of
night, in disguise, and then we would have a wild excitement–because he
must be steering for his secret mine, and now was the time to follow
him. In less than three hours after daylight all the horses and mules
and donkeys in the vicinity would be bought, hired or stolen, and half
the community would be off for the mountains, following in the wake of
Whiteman. But W. would drift about through the mountain gorges for days
together, in a purposeless sort of way, until the provisions of the
miners ran out, and they would have to go back home. I have known it
reported at eleven at night, in a large mining camp, that Whiteman had
just passed through, and in two hours the streets, so quiet before,
would be swarming with men and animals. Every individual would be trying
to be very secret, but yet venturing to whisper to just one neighbor
that W. had passed through. And long before daylight–this in the dead of
Winter–the stampede would be complete, the camp deserted, and the whole
population gone chasing after W.</p>
<p>The tradition was that in the early immigration, more than twenty
years ago, three young Germans, brothers, who had survived an Indian
massacre on the Plains, wandered on foot through the deserts, avoiding
all trails and roads, and simply holding a westerly direction and hoping
to find California before they starved, or died of fatigue. And in a
gorge in the mountains they sat down to rest one day, when one of them
noticed a curious vein of cement running along the ground, shot full of
lumps of dull yellow metal. They saw that it was gold, and that here was
a fortune to be acquired in a single day. The vein was about as wide as
a curbstone, and fully two thirds of it was pure gold. Every pound of
the wonderful cement was worth well-nigh 00.</p>
<p>Each of the brothers loaded himself with about twenty-five pounds of
it, and then they covered up all traces of the vein, made a rude drawing
of the locality and the principal landmarks in the vicinity, and started
westward again. But troubles thickened about them. In their wanderings
one brother fell and broke his leg, and the others were obliged to go on
and leave him to die in the wilderness. Another, worn out and starving,
gave up by and by, and laid down to die, but after two or three weeks of
incredible hardships, the third reached the settlements of California
exhausted, sick, and his mind deranged by his sufferings. He had thrown
away all his cement but a few fragments, but these were sufficient to
set everybody wild with excitement. However, he had had enough of the
cement country, and nothing could induce him to lead a party thither. He
was entirely content to work on a farm for wages. But he gave Whiteman
his map, and described the cement region as well as he could and thus
transferred the curse to that gentleman–for when I had my one accidental
glimpse of Mr. W. in Esmeralda he had been hunting for the lost mine, in
hunger and thirst, poverty and sickness, for twelve or thirteen years.
Some people believed he had found it, but most people believed he had
not. I saw a piece of cement as large as my fist which was said to have
been given to Whiteman by the young German, and it was of a seductive
nature. Lumps of virgin gold were as thick in it as raisins in a slice
of fruit cake. The privilege of working such a mine one week would be
sufficient for a man of reasonable desires.</p>
<p>A new partner of ours, a Mr. Higbie, knew Whiteman well by sight, and
a friend of ours, a Mr. Van Dorn, was well acquainted with him, and not
only that, but had Whiteman’s promise that he should have a private hint
in time to enable him to join the next cement expedition. Van Dorn had
promised to extend the hint to us. One evening Higbie came in greatly
excited, and said he felt certain he had recognized Whiteman, up town,
disguised and in a pretended state of intoxication. In a little while
Van Dorn arrived and confirmed the news; and so we gathered in our cabin
and with heads close together arranged our plans in impressive
whispers.</p>
<p>We were to leave town quietly, after midnight, in two or three small
parties, so as not to attract attention, and meet at dawn on the
“divide“ overlooking Mono Lake, eight or nine miles distant. We were to
make no noise after starting, and not speak above a whisper under any
circumstances. It was believed that for once Whiteman’s presence was
unknown in the town and his expedition unsuspected. Our conclave broke
up at nine o’clock, and we set about our preparation diligently and with
profound secrecy. At eleven o’clock we saddled our horses, hitched them
with their long riatas (or lassos), and then brought out a side of
bacon, a sack of beans, a small sack of coffee, some sugar, a hundred
pounds of flour in sacks, some tin cups and a coffee pot, frying pan and
some few other necessary articles. All these things were “packed“ on the
back of a led horse–and whoever has not been taught, by a Spanish adept,
to pack an animal, let him never hope to do the thing by natural
smartness. That is impossible. Higbie had had some experience, but was
not perfect. He put on the pack saddle (a thing like a saw-buck), piled
the property on it and then wound a rope all over and about it and under
it, “every which way,“ taking a hitch in it every now and then, and
occasionally surging back on it till the horse’s sides sunk in and he
gasped for breath–but every time the lashings grew tight in one place
they loosened in another. We never did get the load tight all over, but
we got it so that it would do, after a fashion, and then we started, in
single file, close order, and without a word. It was a dark night. We
kept the middle of the road, and proceeded in a slow walk past the rows
of cabins, and whenever a miner came to his door I trembled for fear the
light would shine on us an excite curiosity. But nothing happened. We
began the long winding ascent of the canyon, toward the “divide,“ and
presently the cabins began to grow infrequent, and the intervals between
them wider and wider, and then I began to breathe tolerably freely and
feel less like a thief and a murderer. I was in the rear, leading the
pack horse. As the ascent grew steeper he grew proportionately less
satisfied with his cargo, and began to pull back on his riata
occasionally and delay progress. My comrades were passing out of sight
in the gloom. I was getting anxious. I coaxed and bullied the pack horse
till I presently got him into a trot, and then the tin cups and pans
strung about his person frightened him and he ran. His riata was wound
around the pummel of my saddle, and so, as he went by he dragged me from
my horse and the two animals traveled briskly on without me. But I was
not alone–the loosened cargo tumbled overboard from the pack horse and
fell close to me. It was abreast of almost the last cabin.</p>
<p>A miner came out and said:</p>
<p>“Hello!“</p>
<p>I was thirty steps from him, and knew he could not see me, it was so
very dark in the shadow of the mountain. So I lay still. Another head
appeared in the light of the cabin door, and presently the two men
walked toward me. They stopped within ten steps of me, and one said:</p>
<p>“Sh! Listen.“</p>
<p>I could not have been in a more distressed state if I had been
escaping justice with a price on my head. Then the miners appeared to
sit down on a boulder, though I could not see them distinctly enough to
be very sure what they did. One said:</p>
<p>“I heard a noise, as plain as I ever heard anything. It seemed to be
about there–“</p>
<p>A stone whizzed by my head. I flattened myself out in the dust like a
postage stamp, and thought to myself if he mended his aim ever so little
he would probably hear another noise. In my heart, now, I execrated
secret expeditions. I promised myself that this should be my last,
though the Sierras were ribbed with cement veins. Then one of the men
said:</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what! Welch knew what he was talking about when he
said he saw Whiteman to-day. I heard horses–that was the noise. I am
going down to Welch’s, right away.“</p>
<p>They left and I was glad. I did not care whither they went, so they
went. I was willing they should visit Welch, and the sooner the
better.</p>
<p>As soon as they closed their cabin door my comrades emerged from the
gloom; they had caught the horses and were waiting for a clear coast
again. We remounted the cargo on the pack horse and got under way, and
as day broke we reached the “divide“ and joined Van Dorn. Then we
journeyed down into the valley of the Lake, and feeling secure, we
halted to cook breakfast, for we were tired and sleepy and hungry. Three
hours later the rest of the population filed over the “divide“ in a long
procession, and drifted off out of sight around the borders of the
Lake!</p>
<p>Whether or not my accident had produced this result we never knew,
but at least one thing was certain–the secret was out and Whiteman would
not enter upon a search for the cement mine this time. We were filled
with chagrin.</p>
<p>We held a council and decided to make the best of our misfortune and
enjoy a week’s holiday on the borders of the curious Lake. Mono, it is
sometimes called, and sometimes the “Dead Sea of California.“ It is one
of the strangest freaks of Nature to be found in any land, but it is
hardly ever mentioned in print and very seldom visited, because it lies
away off the usual routes of travel and besides is so difficult to get
at that only men content to endure the roughest life will consent to
take upon themselves the discomforts of such a trip. On the morning of
our second day, we traveled around to a remote and particularly wild
spot on the borders of the Lake, where a stream of fresh, ice-cold water
entered it from the mountain side, and then we went regularly into camp.
We hired a large boat and two shot-guns from a lonely ranchman who lived
some ten miles further on, and made ready for comfort and recreation. We
soon got thoroughly acquainted with the Lake and all its
peculiarities.</p>
