<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>Now came great news! Stunning news–joyous news, in fact. It came from
a neighboring state, where the family’s only surviving relative lived.
It was Sally’s relative–a sort of vague and indefinite uncle or second
or third cousin by the name of Tilbury Foster, seventy and a bachelor,
reputed well off and corresponding sour and crusty. Sally had tried to
make up to him once, by letter, in a bygone time, and had not made that
mistake again. Tilbury now wrote to Sally, saying he should shortly die,
and should leave him thirty thousand dollars, cash; not for love, but
because money had given him most of his troubles and exasperations, and
he wished to place it where there was good hope that it would continue
its malignant work. The bequest would be found in his will, and would be
paid over. PROVIDED, that Sally should be able to prove to the executors
that he had TAKEN NO NOTICE OF THE GIFT BY SPOKEN WORD OR BY LETTER, HAD
MADE NO INQUIRIES CONCERNING THE MORIBUND’S PROGRESS TOWARD THE
EVERLASTING TROPICS, AND HAD NOT ATTENDED THE FUNERAL.</p>
<p>As soon as Aleck had partially recovered from the tremendous emotions
created by the letter, she sent to the relative’s habitat and subscribed
for the local paper.</p>
<p>Man and wife entered into a solemn compact, now, to never mention the
great news to any one while the relative lived, lest some ignorant
person carry the fact to the death-bed and distort it and make it appear
that they were disobediently thankful for the bequest, and just the same
as confessing it and publishing it, right in the face of the
prohibition.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day Sally made havoc and confusion with his
books, and Aleck could not keep her mind on her affairs, not even take
up a flower-pot or book or a stick of wood without forgetting what she
had intended to do with it. For both were dreaming.</p>
<p>“Thir-ty thousand dollars!“</p>
<p>All day long the music of those inspiring words sang through those
people’s heads.</p>
<p>From his marriage-day forth, Aleck’s grip had been upon the purse,
and Sally had seldom known what it was to be privileged to squander a
dime on non-necessities.</p>
<p>“Thir-ty thousand dollars!“ the song went on and on. A vast sum, an
unthinkable sum!</p>
<p>All day long Aleck was absorbed in planning how to invest it, Sally
in planning how to spend it.</p>
<p>There was no romance-reading that night. The children took themselves
away early, for their parents were silent, distraught, and strangely
unentertaining. The good-night kisses might as well have been impressed
upon vacancy, for all the response they got; the parents were not aware
of the kisses, and the children had been gone an hour before their
absence was noticed. Two pencils had been busy during that
hour–note-making; in the way of plans. It was Sally who broke the
stillness at last. He said, with exultation:</p>
<p>“Ah, it’ll be grand, Aleck! Out of the first thousand we’ll have a
horse and a buggy for summer, and a cutter and a skin lap-robe for
winter.“</p>
<p>Aleck responded with decision and composure–</p>
<p>“Out of the CAPITAL? Nothing of the kind. Not if it was a
million!“</p>
<p>Sally was deeply disappointed; the glow went out of his face.</p>
<p>“Oh, Aleck!“ he said, reproachfully. “We’ve always worked so hard and
been so scrimped: and now that we are rich, it does seem–“</p>
<p>He did not finish, for he saw her eye soften; his supplication had
touched her. She said, with gentle persuasiveness:</p>
<p>“We must not spend the capital, dear, it would not be wise. Out of
the income from it–“</p>
<p>“That will answer, that will answer, Aleck! How dear and good you
are! There will be a noble income and if we can spend that–“</p>
<p>“Not ALL of it, dear, not all of it, but you can spend a part of it.
That is, a reasonable part. But the whole of the capital –every penny of
it–must be put right to work, and kept at it. You see the reasonableness
of that, don’t you?“</p>
<p>“Why, ye-s. Yes, of course. But we’ll have to wait so long. Six
months before the first interest falls due.“</p>
<p>“Yes–maybe longer.“</p>
<p>“Longer, Aleck? Why? Don’t they pay half-yearly?“</p>
<p>“THAT kind of an investment–yes; but I sha’n’t invest in that
way.“</p>
<p>“What way, then?“</p>
<p>“For big returns.“</p>
<p>“Big. That’s good. Go on, Aleck. What is it?“</p>
<p>“Coal. The new mines. Cannel. I mean to put in ten thousand. Ground
floor. When we organize, we’ll get three shares for one.“</p>
<p>“By George, but it sounds good, Aleck! Then the shares will be worth
–how much? And when?“</p>
<p>“About a year. They’ll pay ten per cent. half yearly, and be worth
thirty thousand. I know all about it; the advertisement is in the
Cincinnati paper here.“</p>
<p>“Land, thirty thousand for ten–in a year! Let’s jam in the whole
capital and pull out ninety! I’ll write and subscribe right now
–tomorrow it maybe too late.“</p>
<p>He was flying to the writing-desk, but Aleck stopped him and put him
back in his chair. She said:</p>
<p>“Don’t lose your head so. WE mustn’t subscribe till we’ve got the
money; don’t you know that?“</p>
<p>Sally’s excitement went down a degree or two, but he was not wholly
appeased.</p>
<p>“Why, Aleck, we’ll HAVE it, you know–and so soon, too. He’s probably
out of his troubles before this; it’s a hundred to nothing he’s
selecting his brimstone-shovel this very minute. Now, I think–“</p>
<p>Aleck shuddered, and said:</p>
<p>“How CAN you, Sally! Don’t talk in that way, it is perfectly
scandalous.“</p>
<p>“Oh, well, make it a halo, if you like, <em>I</em> don’t care for his
outfit, I was only just talking. Can’t you let a person talk?“</p>
<p>“But why should you WANT to talk in that dreadful way? How would you
like to have people talk so about YOU, and you not cold yet?“</p>
<p>“Not likely to be, for ONE while, I reckon, if my last act was giving
away money for the sake of doing somebody a harm with it. But never mind
about Tilbury, Aleck, let’s talk about something worldly. It does seem
to me that that mine is the place for the whole thirty. What’s the
objection?“</p>
<p>“All the eggs in one basket–that’s the objection.“</p>
<p>“All right, if you say so. What about the other twenty? What do you
mean to do with that?“</p>
<p>“There is no hurry; I am going to look around before I do anything
with it.“</p>
<p>“All right, if your mind’s made up,“ signed Sally. He was deep in
thought awhile, then he said:</p>
<p>“There’ll be twenty thousand profit coming from the ten a year from
now. We can spend that, can we, Aleck?“</p>
<p>Aleck shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, dear,“ she said, “it won’t sell high till we’ve had the first
semi-annual dividend. You can spend part of that.“</p>
<p>“Shucks, only THAT–and a whole year to wait! Confound it, I–“</p>
<p>“Oh, do be patient! It might even be declared in three months –it’s
quite within the possibilities.“</p>
<p>“Oh, jolly! oh, thanks!“ and Sally jumped up and kissed his wife in
gratitude. “It’ll be three thousand–three whole thousand! how much of it
can we spend, Aleck? Make it liberal!–do, dear, that’s a good
fellow.“</p>
<p>Aleck was pleased; so pleased that she yielded to the pressure and
conceded a sum which her judgment told her was a foolish extravagance –a
thousand dollars. Sally kissed her half a dozen times and even in that
way could not express all his joy and thankfulness. This new access of
gratitude and affection carried Aleck quite beyond the bounds of
prudence, and before she could restrain herself she had made her darling
another grant–a couple of thousand out of the fifty or sixty which she
meant to clear within a year of the twenty which still remained of the
bequest. The happy tears sprang to Sally’s eyes, and he said:</p>
<p>“Oh, I want to hug you!“ And he did it. Then he got his notes and sat
down and began to check off, for first purchase, the luxuries which he
should earliest wish to secure.
“Horse–buggy–cutter–lap-robe–patent-leathers–dog–plug-hat
–church-pew–stem-winder–new teeth–SAY, Aleck!“</p>
<p>“Well?“</p>
<p>“Ciphering away, aren’t you? That’s right. Have you got the twenty
thousand invested yet?“</p>
<p>“No, there’s no hurry about that; I must look around first, and
think.“</p>
<p>“But you are ciphering; what’s it about?“</p>
<p>“Why, I have to find work for the thirty thousand that comes out of
the coal, haven’t I?“</p>
<p>“Scott, what a head! I never thought of that. How are you getting
along? Where have you arrived?“</p>
<p>“Not very far–two years or three. I’ve turned it over twice; once in
oil and once in wheat.“</p>
<p>“Why, Aleck, it’s splendid! How does it aggregate?“</p>
<p>“I think–well, to be on the safe side, about a hundred and eighty
thousand clear, though it will probably be more.“</p>
<p>“My! isn’t it wonderful? By gracious! luck has come our way at last,
after all the hard sledding, Aleck!“</p>
<p>“Well?“</p>
<p>“I’m going to cash in a whole three hundred on the missionaries –what
real right have we care for expenses!“</p>
<p>“You couldn’t do a nobler thing, dear; and it’s just like your
generous nature, you unselfish boy.“</p>
<p>The praise made Sally poignantly happy, but he was fair and just
enough to say it was rightfully due to Aleck rather than to himself,
since but for her he should never have had the money.</p>
<p>Then they went up to bed, and in their delirium of bliss they forgot
and left the candle burning in the parlor. They did not remember until
they were undressed; then Sally was for letting it burn; he said they
could afford it, if it was a thousand. But Aleck went down and put it
out.</p>
<p>A good job, too; for on her way back she hit on a scheme that would
turn the hundred and eighty thousand into half a million before it had
had time to get cold.</p>
