<h4 id="chapter-xxix-looking-west-for-sunrise">Chapter XXIX [Looking
West for Sunrise]</h4>
<p>He kept his word. We heard his horn and instantly got up. It was dark
and cold and wretched. As I fumbled around for the matches, knocking
things down with my quaking hands, I wished the sun would rise in the
middle of the day, when it was warm and bright and cheerful, and one
wasn’t sleepy. We proceeded to dress by the gloom of a couple sickly
candles, but we could hardly button anything, our hands shook so. I
thought of how many happy people there were in Europe, Asia, and
America, and everywhere, who were sleeping peacefully in their beds, and
did not have to get up and see the Rigi sunrise–people who did not
appreciate their advantage, as like as not, but would get up in the
morning wanting more boons of Providence. While thinking these thoughts
I yawned, in a rather ample way, and my upper teeth got hitched on a
nail over the door, and while I was mounting a chair to free myself,
Harris drew the window-curtain, and said:</p>
<p>“Oh, this is luck! We shan’t have to go out at all –yonder are the
mountains, in full view.“</p>
<p>That was glad news, indeed. It made us cheerful right away. One could
see the grand Alpine masses dimly outlined against the black firmament,
and one or two faint stars blinking through rifts in the night. Fully
clothed, and wrapped in blankets, and huddled ourselves up, by the
window, with lighted pipes, and fell into chat, while we waited in
exceeding comfort to see how an Alpine sunrise was going to look by
candlelight. By and by a delicate, spiritual sort of effulgence spread
itself by imperceptible degrees over the loftiest altitudes of the snowy
wastes–but there the effort seemed to stop. I said, presently:</p>
<p>“There is a hitch about this sunrise somewhere. It doesn’t seem to
go. What do you reckon is the matter with it?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It appears to hang fire somewhere. I never saw a
sunrise act like that before. Can it be that the hotel is playing
anything on us?“</p>
<p>“Of course not. The hotel merely has a property interest in the sun,
it has nothing to do with the management of it. It is a precarious kind
of property, too; a succession of total eclipses would probably ruin
this tavern. Now what can be the matter with this sunrise?“</p>
<p>Harris jumped up and said:</p>
<p>“I’ve got it! I know what’s the matter with it! We’ve been looking at
the place where the sun SET last night!“</p>
<p>“It is perfectly true! Why couldn’t you have thought of that sooner?
Now we’ve lost another one! And all through your blundering. It was
exactly like you to light a pipe and sit down to wait for the sun to
rise in the west.“</p>
<p>“It was exactly like me to find out the mistake, too. You never would
have found it out. I find out all the mistakes.“</p>
<p>“You make them all, too, else your most valuable faculty would be
wasted on you. But don’t stop to quarrel, now–maybe we are not too late
yet.“</p>
<p>But we were. The sun was well up when we got to the
exhibition-ground.</p>
<p>On our way up we met the crowd returning–men and women dressed in all
sorts of queer costumes, and exhibiting all degrees of cold and
wretchedness in their gaits and countenances. A dozen still remained on
the ground when we reached there, huddled together about the scaffold
with their backs to the bitter wind. They had their red guide-books open
at the diagram of the view, and were painfully picking out the several
mountains and trying to impress their names and positions on their
memories. It was one of the saddest sights I ever saw.</p>
<p>Two sides of this place were guarded by railings, to keep people from
being blown over the precipices. The view, looking sheer down into the
broad valley, eastward, from this great elevation–almost a perpendicular
mile–was very quaint and curious. Counties, towns, hilly ribs and
ridges, wide stretches of green meadow, great forest tracts, winding
streams, a dozen blue lakes, a block of busy steamboats–we saw all this
little world in unique circumstantiality of detail–saw it just as the
birds see it–and all reduced to the smallest of scales and as sharply
worked out and finished as a steel engraving. The numerous toy villages,
with tiny spires projecting out of them, were just as the children might
have left them when done with play the day before; the forest tracts
were diminished to cushions of moss; one or two big lakes were dwarfed
to ponds, the smaller ones to puddles–though they did not look like
puddles, but like blue teardrops which had fallen and lodged in slight
depressions, conformable to their shapes, among the moss-beds and the
smooth levels of dainty green farm-land; the microscopic steamboats
glided along, as in a city reservoir, taking a mighty time to cover the
distance between ports which seemed only a yard apart; and the isthmus
which separated two lakes looked as if one might stretch out on it and
lie with both elbows in the water, yet we knew invisible wagons were
toiling across it and finding the distance a tedious one. This beautiful
miniature world had exactly the appearance of those “relief maps“ which
reproduce nature precisely, with the heights and depressions and other
details graduated to a reduced scale, and with the rocks, trees, lakes,
etc., colored after nature.</p>
<p>I believed we could walk down to Waeggis or Vitznau in a day, but I
knew we could go down by rail in about an hour, so I chose the latter
method. I wanted to see what it was like, anyway. The train came along
about the middle of the afternoon, and an odd thing it was. The
locomotive-boiler stood on end, and it and the whole locomotive were
tilted sharply backward. There were two passenger-cars, roofed, but wide
open all around. These cars were not tilted back, but the seats were;
this enables the passenger to sit level while going down a steep
incline.</p>
<p>There are three railway-tracks; the central one is cogged; the
“lantern wheel“ of the engine grips its way along these cogs, and pulls
the train up the hill or retards its motion on the down trip. About the
same speed–three miles an hour–is maintained both ways. Whether going up
or down, the locomotive is always at the lower end of the train. It
pushes in the one case, braces back in the other. The passenger rides
backward going up, and faces forward going down.</p>
<p>We got front seats, and while the train moved along about fifty yards
on level ground, I was not the least frightened; but now it started
abruptly downstairs, and I caught my breath. And I, like my neighbors,
unconsciously held back all I could, and threw my weight to the rear,
but, of course, that did no particular good. I had slidden down the
balusters when I was a boy, and thought nothing of it, but to slide down
the balusters in a railway-train is a thing to make one’s flesh creep.
Sometimes we had as much as ten yards of almost level ground, and this
gave us a few full breaths in comfort; but straightway we would turn a
corner and see a long steep line of rails stretching down below us, and
the comfort was at an end. One expected to see the locomotive pause, or
slack up a little, and approach this plunge cautiously, but it did
nothing of the kind; it went calmly on, and went it reached the
jumping-off place it made a sudden bow, and went gliding smoothly
downstairs, untroubled by the circumstances.</p>
<p>It was wildly exhilarating to slide along the edge of the precipices,
after this grisly fashion, and look straight down upon that far-off
valley which I was describing a while ago.</p>
<p>There was no level ground at the Kaltbad station; the railbed was as
steep as a roof; I was curious to see how the stop was going to be
managed. But it was very simple; the train came sliding down, and when
it reached the right spot it just stopped–that was all there was “to
it“–stopped on the steep incline, and when the exchange of passengers
and baggage had been made, it moved off and went sliding down again. The
train can be stopped anywhere, at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>There was one curious effect, which I need not take the trouble to
describe–because I can scissor a description of it out of the railway
company’s advertising pamphlet, and save my ink:</p>
<p>“On the whole tour, particularly at the Descent, we undergo an
optical illusion which often seems to be incredible. All the shrubs, fir
trees, stables, houses, etc., seem to be bent in a slanting direction,
as by an immense pressure of air. They are all standing awry, so much
awry that the chalets and cottages of the peasants seem to be tumbling
down. It is the consequence of the steep inclination of the line. Those
who are seated in the carriage do not observe that they are doing down a
declivity of twenty to twenty-five degrees (their seats being adapted to
this course of proceeding and being bent down at their backs). They
mistake their carriage and its horizontal lines for a proper measure of
the normal plain, and therefore all the objects outside which really are
in a horizontal position must show a disproportion of twenty to
twenty-five degrees declivity, in regard to the mountain.“</p>
<p>By the time one reaches Kaltbad, he has acquired confidence in the
railway, and he now ceases to try to ease the locomotive by holding
back. Thenceforth he smokes his pipe in serenity, and gazes out upon the
magnificent picture below and about him with unfettered enjoyment. There
is nothing to interrupt the view or the breeze; it is like inspecting
the world on the wing. However–to be exact–there is one place where the
serenity lapses for a while; this is while one is crossing the
Schnurrtobel Bridge, a frail structure which swings its gossamer frame
down through the dizzy air, over a gorge, like a vagrant
spider-strand.</p>
<p>One has no difficulty in remembering his sins while the train is
creeping down this bridge; and he repents of them, too; though he sees,
when he gets to Vitznau, that he need not have done it, the bridge was
perfectly safe.</p>
<p>So ends the eventual trip which we made to the Rigi-Kulm to see an
Alpine sunrise.</p>
