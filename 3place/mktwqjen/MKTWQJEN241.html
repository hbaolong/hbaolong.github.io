<h4 id="a-mysterious-visit">A MYSTERIOUS VISIT</h4>
<p>The first notice that was taken of me when I “settled down“ recently
was by a gentleman who said he was an assessor, and connected with the
U. S. Internal Revenue Department. I said I had never heard of his
branch of business before, but I was very glad to see him all the same.
Would he sit down? He sat down. I did not know anything particular to
say, and yet I felt that people who have arrived at the dignity of
keeping house must be conversational, must be easy and sociable in
company. So, in default of anything else to say, I asked him if he was
opening his shop in our neighborhood.</p>
<p>He said he was. [I did not wish to appear ignorant, but I had hoped
he would mention what he had for sale.]</p>
<p>I ventured to ask him “How was trade?“ And he said “So-so.“</p>
<p>I then said we would drop in, and if we liked his house as well as
any other, we would give him our custom.</p>
<p>He said he thought we would like his establishment well enough to
confine ourselves to it–said he never saw anybody who would go off and
hunt up another man in his line after trading with him once.</p>
<p>That sounded pretty complacent, but barring that natural expression
of villainy which we all have, the man looked honest enough.</p>
<p>I do not know how it came about exactly, but gradually we appeared to
melt down and run together, conversationally speaking, and then
everything went along as comfortably as clockwork.</p>
<p>We talked, and talked, and talked–at least I did; and we laughed, and
laughed, and laughed–at least he did. But all the time I had my presence
of mind about me–I had my native shrewdness turned on “full head,“ as
the engineers say. I was determined to find out all about his business
in spite of his obscure answers–and I was determined I would have it out
of him without his suspecting what I was at. I meant to trap him with a
deep, deep ruse. I would tell him all about my own business, and he
would naturally so warm to me during this seductive burst of confidence
that he would forget himself, and tell me all about his affairs before
he suspected what I was about. I thought to myself, My son, you little
know what an old fox you are dealing with. I said:</p>
<p>“Now you never would guess what I made lecturing this winter and last
spring?“</p>
<p>“No–don’t believe I could, to save me. Let me see–let me see. About
two thousand dollars, maybe? But no; no, sir, I know you couldn’t have
made that much. Say seventeen hundred, maybe?“</p>
<p>“Ha! ha! I knew you couldn’t. My lecturing receipts for last spring
and this winter were fourteen thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars.
What do you think of that?“</p>
<p>“Why, it is amazing-perfectly amazing. I will make a note of it. And
you say even this wasn’t all?“</p>
<p>“All! Why bless you, there was my income from the Daily Warwhoop for
four months–about–about–well, what should you say to about eight
thousand dollars, for instance?“</p>
<p>“Say! Why, I should say I should like to see myself rolling in just
such another ocean of affluence. Eight thousand! I’ll make a note of it.
Why man!–and on top of all this am I to understand that you had still
more income?“</p>
<p>“Ha! ha! ha! Why, you’re only in the suburbs of it, so to speak.
There’s my book, The Innocents Abroad price .50 to , according to the
binding. Listen to me. Look me in the eye. During the last four months
and a half, saying nothing of sales before that, but just simply during
the four months and a half, we’ve sold ninety-five thousand copies of
that book. Ninety-five thousand! Think of it. Average four dollars a
copy, say. It’s nearly four hundred thousand dollars, my son. I get
half.“</p>
<p>“The suffering Moses! I’ll set that down. Fourteen-seven-fifty
–eight–two hundred. Total, say–well, upon my word, the grand total is
about two hundred and thirteen or fourteen thousand dollars! Is that
possible?“</p>
<p>“Possible! If there’s any mistake it’s the other way. Two hundred and
fourteen thousand, cash, is my income for this year if I know how to
cipher.“</p>
<p>Then the gentleman got up to go. It came over me most uncomfortably
that maybe I had made my revelations for nothing, besides being
flattered into stretching them considerably by the stranger’s astonished
exclamations. But no; at the last moment the gentleman handed me a large
envelope, and said it contained his advertisement; and that I would find
out all about his business in it; and that he would be happy to have my
custom-would, in fact, be proud to have the custom of a man of such
prodigious income; and that he used to think there were several wealthy
men in the city, but when they came to trade with him he discovered that
they barely had enough to live on; and that, in truth, it had been such
a weary, weary age since he had seen a rich man face to face, and talked
to him, and touched him with his hands, that he could hardly refrain
from embracing me–in fact, would esteem it a great favor if I would let
him embrace me.</p>
<p>This so pleased me that I did not try to resist, but allowed this
simple-hearted stranger to throw his arms about me and weep a few
tranquilizing tears down the back of my neck. Then he went his way.</p>
<p>As soon as he was gone I opened his advertisement. I studied it
attentively for four minutes. I then called up the cook, and said:</p>
<p>“Hold me while I faint! Let Marie turn the griddle-cakes.“</p>
<p>By and by, when I came to, I sent down to the rum-mill on the corner
and hired an artist by the week to sit up nights and curse that
stranger, and give me a lift occasionally in the daytime when I came to
a hard place.</p>
<p>Ah, what a miscreant he was! His “advertisement“ was nothing in the
world but a wicked tax-return–a string of impertinent questions about my
private affairs, occupying the best part of four fools-cap pages of fine
print-questions, I may remark, gotten up with such marvelous ingenuity
that the oldest man in the world couldn’t understand what the most of
them were driving at–questions, too, that were calculated to make a man
report about four times his actual income to keep from swearing to a
falsehood. I looked for a loophole, but there did not appear to be any.
Inquiry No. 1 covered my case as generously and as amply as an umbrella
could cover an ant-hill:</p>
<p>What were your profits, during the past year, from any trade,
business, or vocation, wherever carried on?</p>
<p>And that inquiry was backed up by thirteen others of an equally
searching nature, the most modest of which required information as to
whether I had committed any burglary or highway robbery, or, by any
arson or other secret source of emolument had acquired property which
was not enumerated in my statement of income as set opposite to inquiry
No. 1.</p>
<p>It was plain that that stranger had enabled me to make a goose of
myself. It was very, very plain; and so I went out and hired another
artist. By working on my vanity, the stranger had seduced me into
declaring an income of two hundred and fourteen thousand dollars. By
law, one thousand dollars of this was exempt from income tax–the only
relief I could see, and it was only a drop in the ocean. At the legal
five per cent., I must pay to the government the sum of ten thousand six
hundred and fifty dollars, income tax!</p>
<p>[I may remark, in this place, that I did not do it.]</p>
<p>I am acquainted with a very opulent man, whose house is a palace,
whose table is regal, whose outlays are enormous, yet a man who has no
income, as I have often noticed by the revenue returns; and to him I
went for advice in my distress. He took my dreadful exhibition of
receipts, he put on his glasses, he took his pen, and presto!–I was a
pauper! It was the neatest thing that ever was. He did it simply by
deftly manipulating the bill of “DEDUCTIONS.“ He set down my “State,
national, and municipal taxes“ at so much; my “losses by shipwreck;
fire, etc.,“ at so much; my “losses on sales of real estate“–on “live
stock sold“–on “payments for rent of homestead“–on “repairs,
improvements, interest“–on “previously taxed salary as an officer of the
United States army, navy, revenue service,“ and other things. He got
astonishing “deductions“ out of each and every one of these matters–each
and every one of them. And when he was done he handed me the paper, and
I saw at a glance that during the year my income, in the way of profits,
had been one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars and forty cents.</p>
<p>“Now,“ said he, “the thousand dollars is exempt by law. What you want
to do is to go and swear this document in and pay tax on the two hundred
and fifty dollars.“</p>
<p>[While he was making this speech his little boy Willie lifted a
two-dollar greenback out of his vest pocket and vanished with it, and I
would wager; anything that if my stranger were to call on that little
boy to-morrow he would make a false return of his income.]</p>
<p>“Do you,“ said I, “do you always work up the ‘deductions’ after this
fashion in your own case, sir?“</p>
<p>“Well, I should say so! If it weren’t for those eleven saving clauses
under the head of ‘Deductions’ I should be beggared every year to
support this hateful and wicked, this extortionate and tyrannical
government.“</p>
<p>This gentleman stands away up among the very best of the solid men of
the city–the men of moral weight, of commercial integrity, of
unimpeachable, social spotlessness–and so I bowed to his example. I went
down to the revenue office, and under the accusing eyes of my old
visitor I stood up and swore to lie after lie, fraud after fraud,
villainy after villainy, till my soul was coated inches and inches thick
with perjury, and my self-respect gone for ever and ever.</p>
<p>But what of it? It is nothing more than thousands of the richest and
proudest, and most respected, honored, and courted men in America do
every year. And so I don’t care. I am not ashamed. I shall simply, for
the present, talk little and eschew fire-proof gloves, lest I fall into
certain dreadful habits irrevocably.</p>
