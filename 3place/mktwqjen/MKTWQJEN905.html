<h4 id="letters-1868-70.-courtship-and-the-innocents-abroad">LETTERS
1868-70. COURTSHIP, AND “THE INNOCENTS ABROAD“</h4>
<p>The story of Mark Twain’s courtship has been fully told in the
completer story of his life; it need only be briefly sketched here as a
setting for the letters of this period. In his letter of January 8th we
note that he expects to go to Elmira for a few days as soon as he has
time.</p>
<p>But he did not have time, or perhaps did not receive a pressing
invitation until he had returned with his MS. from California. Then,
through young Charles Langdon, his Quaker City shipmate, he was invited
to Elmira. The invitation was given for a week, but through a
subterfuge–unpremeditated, and certainly fair enough in a matter of
love-he was enabled to considerably prolong his visit. By the end of his
stay he had become really “like one of the family,“ though certainly not
yet accepted as such. The fragmentary letter that follows reflects
something of his pleasant situation. The Mrs. Fairbanks mentioned in
this letter had been something more than a “shipmother“ to Mark Twain.
She was a woman of fine literary taste, and Quaker City correspondent
for her husband’s paper, the Cleveland Herald. She had given Mark Twain
sound advice as to his letters, which he had usually read to her, and
had in no small degree modified his early natural tendency to
exaggeration and outlandish humor. He owed her much, and never failed to
pay her tribute.</p>
<p>Part of a letter to Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, N.Y. Aug. 26, 1868. DEAR FOLKS,–You see I am
progressing–though slowly. I shall be here a week yet maybe two–for
Charlie Langdon cannot get away until his father’s chief business man
returns from a journey–and a visit to Mrs. Fairbanks, at Cleveland,
would lose half its pleasure if Charlie were not along. Moulton of
St. Louis ought to be there too. We three were Mrs. F’s “cubs,“ in the
Quaker City. She took good care that we were at church regularly on
Sundays; at the 8-bells prayer meeting every night; and she kept our
buttons sewed on and our clothing in order–and in a word was as busy and
considerate, and as watchful over her family of uncouth and unruly cubs,
and as patient and as long-suffering, withal, as a natural mother. So we
expect…..</p>
<p>Aug. 25th. Didn’t finish yesterday. Something called me away. I am
most comfortably situated here. This is the pleasantest family I ever
knew. I only have one trouble, and that is they give me too much thought
and too much time and invention to the object of making my visit pass
delightfully. It needs—-</p>
<p>Just how and when he left the Langdon home the letters do not record.
Early that fall he began a lecture engagement with James Redpath,
proprietor of the Boston Lyceum Bureau, and his engagements were often
within reach of Elmira. He had a standing invitation now to the Langdon
home, and the end of the week often found him there. Yet when at last he
proposed for the hand of Livy Langdon the acceptance was by no means
prompt. He was a favorite in the Langdon household, but his suitability
as a husband for the frail and gentle daughter was questioned.</p>
<p>However, he was carrying everything, just then, by storm. The largest
houses everywhere were crowded to hear him. Papers spoke of him as the
coming man of the age, people came to their doors to see him pass. There
is but one letter of this period, but it gives us the picture.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>CLEVELAND, Nov. 20, 1868. DEAR FOLKS,–I played against the Eastern
favorite, Fanny Kemble, in Pittsburgh, last night. She had 200 in her
house, and I had upwards of 1,500. All the seats were sold (in a driving
rain storm, 3 days ago,) as reserved seats at 25 cents extra, even those
in the second and third tiers–and when the last seat was gone the box
office had not been open more than 2 hours. When I reached the theatre
they were turning people away and the house was crammed, 150 or 200
stood up, all the evening.</p>
<p>I go to Elmira tonight. I am simply lecturing for societies, at 00 a
pop. Yrs SAM.</p>
<p>It would be difficult for any family to refuse relationship with one
whose star was so clearly ascending, especially when every inclination
was in his favor, and the young lady herself encouraged his suit. A
provisional engagement was presently made, but it was not finally
ratified until February of the following year. Then in a letter from one
of his lecture points he tells his people something of his
happiness.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>LOCKPORT, N. Y. Feb. 27, 1868. DEAR FOLKS,–I enclose 0 for Ma. I
thought I was getting ahead of her little assessments of 5 a month, but
find I am falling behind with her instead, and have let her go without
money. Well, I did not mean to do it. But you see when people have been
getting ready for months in a quiet way to get married, they are bound
to grow stingy, and go to saving up money against that awful day when it
is sure to be needed. I am particularly anxious to place myself in a
position where I can carry on my married life in good shape on my own
hook, because I have paddled my own canoe so long that I could not be
satisfied now to let anybody help me–and my proposed father-in-law is
naturally so liberal that it would be just like him to want to give us a
start in life. But I don’t want it that way. I can start myself. I don’t
want any help. I can run this institution without any outside
assistance, and I shall have a wife who will stand by me like a soldier
through thick and thin, and never complain. She is only a little body,
but she hasn’t her peer in Christendom. I gave her only a plain gold
engagement ring, when fashion imperatively demands a two-hundred dollar
diamond one, and told her it was typical of her future lot–namely, that
she would have to flourish on substantials rather than luxuries. (But
you see I know the girl–she don’t care anything about luxuries.) She is
a splendid girl. She spends no money but her usual year’s allowance, and
she spends nearly every cent of that on other people. She will be a good
sensible little wife, without any airs about her. I don’t make
intercession for her beforehand and ask you to love her, for there isn’t
any use in that–you couldn’t help it if you were to try.</p>
<p>I warn you that whoever comes within the fatal influence of her
beautiful nature is her willing slave for evermore. I take my affidavit
on that statement. Her father and mother and brother embrace and pet her
constantly, precisely as if she were a sweetheart, instead of a blood
relation. She has unlimited power over her father, and yet she never
uses it except to make him help people who stand in need of help….</p>
<p>But if I get fairly started on the subject of my bride, I never shall
get through–and so I will quit right here. I went to Elmira a little
over a week ago, and staid four days and then had to go to New York on
business.</p>
<p>………………….</p>
<p>No further letters have been preserved until June, when he is in
Elmira and with his fiancee reading final proofs on the new book. They
were having an idyllic good time, of course, but it was a useful time,
too, for Olivia Langdon had a keen and refined literary instinct, and
the Innocents Abroad, as well as Mark Twain’s other books, are better
to-day for her influence.</p>
<p>It has been stated that Mark Twain loved the lecture platform, but
from his letters we see that even at this early date, when he was at the
height of his first great vogue as a public entertainer, he had no love
for platform life. Undoubtedly he rejoiced in the brief periods when he
was actually before his audience and could play upon it with his master
touch, but the dreary intermissions of travel and broken sleep were too
heavy a price to pay.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis</p>
<p>ELMIRA, June 4. (1868) DEAR FOLKS,–Livy sends you her love and loving
good wishes, and I send you mine. The last 3 chapters of the book came
tonight–we shall read it in the morning and then thank goodness, we are
done.</p>
<p>In twelve months (or rather I believe it is fourteen,) I have earned
just eighty dollars by my pen–two little magazine squibs and one
newspaper letter–altogether the idlest, laziest 14 months I ever spent
in my life. And in that time my absolute and necessary expenses have
been scorchingly heavy–for I have now less than three thousand six
hundred dollars in bank out of the eight or nine thousand I have made
during those months, lecturing. My expenses were something frightful
during the winter. I feel ashamed of my idleness, and yet I have had
really no inclination to do anything but court Livy. I haven’t any other
inclination yet. I have determined not to work as hard traveling, any
more, as I did last winter, and so I have resolved not to lecture
outside of the 6 New England States next winter. My Western course would
easily amount to 0,000, but I would rather make 2 or 3 thousand in New
England than submit again to so much wearing travel. (I have promised to
talk ten nights for a thousand dollars in the State of New York,
provided the places are close together.) But after all if I get located
in a newspaper in a way to suit me, in the meantime, I don’t want to
lecture at all next winter, and probably shan’t. I most cordially hate
the lecture field. And after all, I shudder to think that I may never
get out of it.</p>
<p>In all conversations with Gough, and Anna Dickinson, Nasby, Oliver
Wendell Holmes, Wendell Phillips and the other old stagers, I could not
observe that they ever expected or hoped to get out of the business. I
don’t want to get wedded to it as they are. Livy thinks we can live on a
very moderate sum and that we’ll not need to lecture. I know very well
that she can live on a small allowance, but I am not so sure about
myself. I can’t scare her by reminding her that her father’s family
expenses are forty thousand dollars a year, because she produces the
documents at once to show that precious little of this outlay is on her
account. But I must not commence writing about Livy, else I shall never
stop. There isn’t such another little piece of perfection in the world
as she is.</p>
<p>My time is become so short, now, that I doubt if I get to California
this summer. If I manage to buy into a paper, I think I will visit you a
while and not go to Cal. at all. I shall know something about it after
my next trip to Hartford. We all go there on the 10th–the whole family
–to attend a wedding, on the 17th. I am offered an interest in a
Cleveland paper which would pay me ,300 to ,500 a year, and a salary
added of ,000. The salary is fair enough, but the interest is not large
enough, and so I must look a little further. The Cleveland folks say
they can be induced to do a little better by me, and urge me to come out
and talk business. But it don’t strike me–I feel little or no
inclination to go.</p>
<p>I believe I haven’t anything else to write, and it is bed-time. I
want to write to Orion, but I keep putting it off–I keep putting
everything off. Day after day Livy and I are together all day long and
until 10 at night, and then I feel dreadfully sleepy. If Orion will bear
with me and forgive me I will square up with him yet. I will even let
him kiss Livy.</p>
<p>My love to Mollie and Annie and Sammie and all. Good-bye.
Affectionately, SAM.</p>
<p>It is curious, with his tendency to optimism and general expansion of
futures, that he says nothing of the possible sales of the new book, or
of his expectations in that line. It was issued in July, and by June the
publishers must have had promising advance orders from their canvassers;
but apparently he includes none of these chickens in his financial
forecast. Even when the book had been out a full month, and was being
shipped at the rate of several hundreds a day, he makes no reference to
it in a letter to his sister, other than to ask if she has not received
a copy. This, however, was a Mark Twain peculiarity. Writing was his
trade; the returns from it seldom excited him. It was only when he
drifted into strange and untried fields that he began to chase rainbows,
to blow iridescent bubbles, and count unmined gold.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>BUFFALO, Aug. 20, 1869. MY DEAR SISTER,–I have only time to write a
line. I got your letter this morning and mailed it to Livy. She will be
expecting me tonight and I am sorry to disappoint her so, but then I
couldn’t well get away. I will go next Saturday.</p>
<p>I have bundled up Livy’s picture and will try and recollect to mail
it tomorrow. It is a porcelaintype and I think you will like it.</p>
<p>I am sorry I never got to St. Louis, because I may be too busy to go,
for a long time. But I have been busy all the time and St. Louis is
clear out of the way, and remote from the world and all ordinary routes
of travel. You must not place too much weight upon this idea of moving
the capital from Washington. St. Louis is in some respects a better
place for it than Washington, though there isn’t more than a toss-up
between the two after all. One is dead and the other in a trance.
Washington is in the centre of population and business, while St. Louis
is far removed from both. And you know there is no geographical centre
any more. The railroads and telegraph have done away with all that. It
is no longer a matter of sufficient importance to be gravely considered
by thinking men. The only centres, now, are narrowed down to those of
intelligence, capital and population. As I said before Washington is the
nearest to those and you don’t have to paddle across a river on ferry
boats of a pattern popular in the dark ages to get to it, nor have to
clamber up vilely paved hills in rascally omnibuses along with a herd of
all sorts of people after you are there. Secondly, the removal of the
capital is one of those old, regular, reliable dodges that are the
bread-and meat of back country congressmen. It is agitated every year.
It always has been, it always will be; It is not new in any respect.
Thirdly. The Capitol has cost 0,000,000 already and lacks a good deal of
being finished, yet. There are single stones in the Treasury building
(and a good many of them) that cost twenty-seven thousand dollars
apiece–and millions were spent in the construction of that and the
Patent Office and the other great government buildings. To move to
St. Louis, the country must throw away a hundred millions of capital
invested in those buildings, and go right to work to spend a hundred
millions on new buildings in St. Louis. Shall we ever have a Congress, a
majority of whose members are hopelessly insane? Probably not. But it is
possible –unquestionably such a thing is possible. Only I don’t believe
it will happen in our time; and I am satisfied the capital will not be
moved until it does happen. But if St. Louis would donate the ground and
the buildings, it would be a different matter. No, Pamela, I don’t see
any good reason to believe you or I will ever see the capital moved.</p>
<p>I have twice instructed the publishers to send you a book–it was the
first thing I did–long before the proofs were finished. Write me if it
is not yet done.</p>
<p>Livy says we must have you all at our marriage, and I say we can’t.
It will be at Christmas or New Years, when such a trip across the
country would be equivalent to murder andandandand arson andandandand
everything else.–And it would cost five hundred dollars–an amount of
money she don’t know the value of now, but will before a year is gone.
She grieves over it, poor little rascal, but it can’t be helped. She
must wait awhile, till I am firmly on my legs, andandandand then she
shall see you. She says her father and mother will invite you just as
soon as the wedding date is definitely fixed, anyway–andandandand she
thinks that’s bound to settle it. But the ice andandandand snow,
andandandand the long hard journey, andandandand the injudiciousness of
laying out any money except what we are obliged to part with while we
are so much in debt, settles the case differently. For it is a debt.</p>
<p>…..Mr. Langdon is just as good as bound for 5,000 for me, and has
already advanced half of it in cash. I wrote and asked whether I had
better send him my note, or a due-bill, or how he would prefer to have
the indebtedness made of record and he answered every other topic in the
letter pleasantly but never replied to that at all. Still, I shall give
my note into the hands of his business agent here, and pay him the
interest as it falls due. We must “go slow.“ We are not in the Cleveland
Herald. We are a hundred thousand times better off, but there isn’t so
much money in it.</p>
<p>(Remainder missing.)</p>
<p>In spite of the immediate success of his book–a success the like of
which had scarcely been known in America-Mark Twain held himself to be,
not a literary man, but a journalist: He had no plans for another book;
as a newspaper owner and editor he expected, with his marriage, to
settle down and devote the rest of his life to journalism. The paper was
the Buffalo Express; his interest in it was one-third–the purchase
price, twenty-five thousand dollars, of which he had paid a part, Jervis
Langdon, his future father-in-law, having furnished cash and security
for the remainder. He was already in possession in August, but he was
not regularly in Buffalo that autumn, for he had agreed with Redpath to
deliver his Quaker City lecture, and the tour would not end until a
short time before his wedding-day, February 2, 1870.</p>
<p>Our next letter hardly belongs in this collection; as it was
doubtless written with at least the possibility of publication in view.
But it is too amusing, too characteristic of Mark Twain, to be omitted.
It was sent in response to an invitation from the New York Society of
California Pioneers to attend a banquet given in New York City, October
13, 1869, and was, of course, read to the assembled diners.</p>
<p>To the New York Society of California Pioneers, in New York City:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, October 11, 1869. GENTLEMEN,–Circumstances render it out of
my power to take advantage of the invitation extended to me through
Mr. Simonton, and be present at your dinner at New York. I regret this
very much, for there are several among you whom I would have a right to
join hands with on the score of old friendship, and I suppose I would
have a sublime general right to shake hands with the rest of you on the
score of kinship in California ups and downs in search of fortune.</p>
<p>If I were to tell some of my experience, you would recognize
California blood in me; I fancy the old, old story would sound familiar,
no doubt. I have the usual stock of reminiscences. For instance: I went
to Esmeralda early. I purchased largely in the “Wide West,“
“Winnemucca,“ and other fine claims, and was very wealthy. I fared
sumptuously on bread when flour was 00 a barrel and had beans for dinner
every Sunday, when none but bloated aristocrats could afford such
grandeur. But I finished by feeding batteries in a quartz mill at 5 a
week, and wishing I was a battery myself and had somebody to feed me. My
claims in Esmeralda are there yet. I suppose I could be persuaded to
sell.</p>
<p>I went to Humboldt District when it was new; I became largely
interested in the “Alba Nueva“ and other claims with gorgeous names, and
was rich again–in prospect. I owned a vast mining property there. I
would not have sold out for less than 00,000 at that time. But I will
now. Finally I walked home–200 miles partly for exercise, and partly
because stage fare was expensive. Next I entered upon an affluent career
in Virginia City, and by a judicious investment of labor and the capital
of friends, became the owner of about all the worthless wild cat mines
there were in that part of the country. Assessments did the business for
me there. There were a hundred and seventeen assessments to one
dividend, and the proportion of income to outlay was a little against
me. My financial barometer went down to 32 Fahrenheit, and the
subscriber was frozen out.</p>
<p>I took up extensions on the main lead-extensions that reached to
British America, in one direction, and to the Isthmus of Panama in the
other–and I verily believe I would have been a rich man if I had ever
found those infernal extensions. But I didn’t. I ran tunnels till I
tapped the Arctic Ocean, and I sunk shafts till I broke through the roof
of perdition; but those extensions turned up missing every time. I am
willing to sell all that property and throw in the improvements.</p>
<p>Perhaps you remember that celebrated “North Ophir?“ I bought that
mine. It was very rich in pure silver. You could take it out in lumps as
large as a filbert. But when it was discovered that those lumps were
melted half dollars, and hardly melted at that, a painful case of
“salting“ was apparent, and the undersigned adjourned to the poorhouse
again.</p>
<p>I paid assessments on “Hale and Norcross“ until they sold me out, and
I had to take in washing for a living–and the next month that infamous
stock went up to ,000 a foot.</p>
<p>I own millions and millions of feet of affluent silver leads in
Nevada –in fact the entire undercrust of that country nearly, and if
Congress would move that State off my property so that I could get at
it, I would be wealthy yet. But no, there she squats–and here am I.
Failing health persuades me to sell. If you know of any one desiring a
permanent investment, I can furnish one that will have the virtue of
being eternal.</p>
<p>I have been through the California mill, with all its “dips, spurs
and angles, variations and sinuosities.“ I have worked there at all the
different trades and professions known to the catalogues. I have been
everything, from a newspaper editor down to a cow-catcher on a
locomotive, and I am encouraged to believe that if there had been a few
more occupations to experiment on, I might have made a dazzling success
at last, and found out what mysterious designs Providence had in
creating me.</p>
<p>But you perceive that although I am not a Pioneer, I have had a
sufficiently variegated time of it to enable me to talk Pioneer like a
native, and feel like a Forty-Niner. Therefore, I cordially welcome you
to your old-remembered homes and your long deserted firesides, and close
this screed with the sincere hope that your visit here will be a happy
one, and not embittered by the sorrowful surprises that absence and
lapse of years are wont to prepare for wanderers; surprises which come
in the form of old friends missed from their places; silence where
familiar voices should be; the young grown old; change and decay
everywhere; home a delusion and a disappointment; strangers at
hearthstone; sorrow where gladness was; tears for laughter; the
melancholy-pomp of death where the grace of life has been!</p>
<p>With all good wishes for the Returned Prodigals, and regrets that I
cannot partake of a small piece of the fatted calf (rare and no gravy,)
I am yours, cordially, MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>In the next letter we find him in the midst of a sort of confusion of
affairs, which, in one form or another, would follow him throughout the
rest of his life. It was the price of his success and popularity,
combined with his general gift for being concerned with a number of
things, and a natural tendency for getting into hot water, which becomes
more evident as the years and letters pass in review. Orion Clemens, in
his attempt to save money for the government, had employed methods and
agents which the officials at Washington did not understand, and refused
to recognize. Instead of winning the credit and commendation he had
expected, he now found himself pursued by claims of considerable
proportions. The “land“ referred to is the Tennessee tract, the heritage
which John Clemens had provided for his children. Mark Twain had long
since lost faith in it, and was not only willing, but eager to renounce
his rights.</p>
<p>“Nasby“ is, of course, David R. Locke, of the Toledo Blade, whose
popularity at this time both as a lecturer and writer was very great.
Clemens had met him here and there on their platform tour, and they had
become good friends. Clemens, in fact, had once proposed to Nasby a
joint trip to the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>The California idea had been given up, but both Mark Twain and Nasby
found engagements enough, and sufficient profit east of the Mississippi.
Boston was often their headquarters that winter (’69 and ’70), and they
were much together. “Josh Billings,“ another of Redpath’s lecturers, was
likewise often to be found in the Lyceum offices. There is a photograph
of Mark Twain, Nasby, and Josh Billings together.</p>
<p>Clemens also, that winter, met William Dean Howells, then in the
early days of his association with the Atlantic Monthly. The two men, so
widely different, became firm friends at sight, and it was to Howells in
the years to come that Mark Twain would write more letters, and more
characteristic letters, than to any other living man. Howells had
favorably reviewed ‘The Innocents Abroad,’ and after the first moment of
their introduction had passed Clemens said: “When I read that review of
yours I felt like the woman who said that she was so glad that her baby
had come white.“ It was not the sort of thing that Howells would have
said, but it was the sort of thing that he could understand and
appreciate from Mark Twain.</p>
<p>In company with Nasby Clemens, that season, also met Oliver Wendell
Holmes. Later he had sent Holmes a copy of his book and received a
pleasantly appreciative reply. “I always like,“ wrote Holmes, “to hear
what one of my fellow countrymen, who is not a Hebrew scholar, or a
reader of hiero-glyphics, but a good-humored traveler with a pair of
sharp, twinkling Yankee (in the broader sense) eyes in his head, has to
say about the things that learned travelers often make unintelligible,
and sentimental ones ridiculous or absurd …. I hope your booksellers
will sell a hundred thousand copies of your travels.“ A wish that was
realized in due time, though it is doubtful if Doctor Holmes or any one
else at the moment believed that a book of that nature and price (it was
.50 a copy) would ever reach such a sale.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</p>
<p>BOSTON, Nov. 9, 1869. MY DEAR SISTER,–Three or four letters just
received from home. My first impulse was to send Orion a check on my
publisher for the money he wants, but a sober second thought suggested
that if he has not defrauded the government out of money, why pay,
simply because the government chooses to consider him in its debt? No:
Right is right. The idea don’t suit me. Let him write the Treasury the
state of the case, and tell them he has no money. If they make his
sureties pay, then I will make the sureties whole, but I won’t pay a
cent of an unjust claim. You talk of disgrace. To my mind it would be
just as disgraceful to allow one’s self to be bullied into paying that
which is unjust.</p>
<p>Ma thinks it is hard that Orion’s share of the land should be swept
away just as it is right on the point (as it always has been) of
becoming valuable. Let her rest easy on that point. This letter is his
ample authority to sell my share of the land immediately and appropriate
the proceeds–giving no account to me, but repaying the amount to Ma
first, or in case of her death, to you or your heirs, whenever in the
future he shall be able to do it. Now, I want no hesitation in this
matter. I renounce my ownership from this date, for this purpose,
provided it is sold just as suddenly as he can sell it.</p>
<p>In the next place–Mr. Langdon is old, and is trying hard to withdraw
from business and seek repose. I will not burden him with a purchase
–but I will ask him to take full possession of a coal tract of the land
without paying a cent, simply conditioning that he shall mine and throw
the coal into market at his own cost, and pay to you and all of you what
he thinks is a fair portion of the profits accruing–you can do as you
please with the rest of the land. Therefore, send me (to Elmira,)
information about the coal deposits so framed that he can comprehend the
matter and can intelligently instruct an agent how to find it and go to
work.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I appear for the first time before a Boston audience
–4,000 critics–and on the success of this matter depends my future
success in New England. But I am not distressed. Nasby is in the same
boat. Tonight decides the fate of his brand-new lecture. He has just
left my room–been reading his lecture to me–was greatly depressed. I
have convinced him that he has little to fear.</p>
<p>I get just about five hundred more applications to lecture than I can
possibly fill–and in the West they say “Charge all you please, but
come.“ I shan’t go West at all. I stop lecturing the 22d of January,
sure. But I shall talk every night up to that time. They flood me with
high-priced invitations to write for magazines and papers, and
publishers besiege me to write books. Can’t do any of these things.</p>
<p>I am twenty-two thousand dollars in debt, and shall earn the money
and pay it within two years–and therefore I am not spending any money
except when it is necessary.</p>
<p>I had my life insured for 0,000 yesterday (what ever became of
Mr. Moffett’ s life insurance?) “for the benefit of my natural
heirs“–the same being my mother, for Livy wouldn’t claim it, you may be
sure of that. This has taken 00 out of my pocket which I was going to
send to Ma. But I will send her some, soon. Tell Orion to keep a stiff
upper lip–when the worst comes to the worst I will come forward. Must
talk in Providence, R. I., tonight. Must leave now. I thank Mollie and
Orion and the rest for your letters, but you see how I am pushed–ought
to have 6 clerks. Affectionately, SAM.</p>
<p>By the end of January, 1870 more than thirty thousand copies of the
Innocents had been sold, and in a letter to his publisher the author
expressed his satisfaction.</p>
<p>To Elisha Bliss, in Hartford:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Jan. 28 ’70. FRIEND BLISS,–….. Yes, I am satisfied with the
way you are running the book. You are running it in staving, tip-top,
first-class style. I never wander into any corner of the country but I
find that an agent has been there before me, and many of that community
have read the book. And on an average about ten people a day come and
hunt me up to thank me and tell me I’m a benefactor! I guess this is a
part of the programme we didn’t expect in the first place.</p>
<p>I think you are rushing this book in a manner to be proud of; and you
will make the finest success of it that has ever been made with a
subscription book, I believe. What with advertising, establishing
agencies, andandandandc., you have got an enormous lot of machinery
under way and hard at work in a wonderfully short space of time. It is
easy to see, when one travels around, that one must be endowed with a
deal of genuine generalship in order to maneuvre a publication whose
line of battle stretches from end to end of a great continent, and whose
foragers and skirmishers invest every hamlet and besiege every village
hidden away in all the vast space between.</p>
<p>I’ll back you against any publisher in America, Bliss–or elsewhere.
Yrs as ever CLEMENS.</p>
<p>There is another letter written just at this time which of all
letters must not be omitted here. Only five years earlier Mark Twain,
poor, and comparatively unknown, had been carrying water while Jim
Gillis and Dick Stoker washed out the pans of dirt in search of the gold
pocket which they did not find. Clemens must have received a letter from
Gillis referring to some particular occasion, but it has disappeared;
the reply, however, always remained one of James Gillis’s treasured
possessions.</p>
<p>To James Gillis, in his cabin on Jackass Hill, Tuolumne Co.,
California:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, N.Y. Jan. 26, ‘70. DEAR JIM,–I remember that old night just
as well! And somewhere among my relics I have your remembrance stored
away. It makes my heart ache yet to call to mind some of those days.
Still, it shouldn’t–for right in the depths of their poverty and their
pocket-hunting vagabondage lay the germ of my coming good fortune. You
remember the one gleam of jollity that shot across our dismal sojourn in
the rain and mud of Angels’ Camp I mean that day we sat around the
tavern stove and heard that chap tell about the frog and how they filled
him with shot. And you remember how we quoted from the yarn and laughed
over it, out there on the hillside while you and dear old Stoker panned
and washed. I jotted the story down in my note-book that day, and would
have been glad to get ten or fifteen dollars for it–I was just that
blind. But then we were so hard up! I published that story, and it
became widely known in America, India, China, England–and the reputation
it made for me has paid me thousands and thousands of dollars since.
Four or five months ago I bought into the Express (I have ordered it
sent to you as long as you live–and if the book keeper sends you any
bills, you let me hear of it.) I went heavily in debt never could have
dared to do that, Jim, if we hadn’t heard the jumping Frog story that
day.</p>
<p>And wouldn’t I love to take old Stoker by the hand, and wouldn’t I
love to see him in his great specialty, his wonderful rendition of
“Rinalds“ in the “Burning Shame!“ Where is Dick and what is he doing?
Give him my fervent love and warm old remembrances.</p>
<p>A week from today I shall be married to a girl even better, and
lovelier than the peerless “Chapparal Quails.“ You can’t come so far,
Jim, but still I cordially invite you to come, anyhow–and I invite Dick,
too. And if you two boys were to land here on that pleasant occasion, we
would make you right royally welcome. Truly your friend, SAML L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>P. S. “California plums are good, Jim–particularly when they are
stewed.“</p>
<p>Steve Gillis, who sent a copy of his letter to the writer, added:
“Dick Stoker–dear, gentle unselfish old Dick-died over three years ago,
aged 78. I am sure it will be a melancholy pleasure to Mark to know that
Dick lived in comfort all his later life, sincerely loved and respected
by all who knew him. He never left Jackass Hill. He struck a pocket
years ago containing enough not only to build himself a comfortable
house near his old cabin, but to last him, without work, to his painless
end. He was a Mason, and was buried by the Order in Sonora.</p>
<p>“The ‘Quails’–the beautiful, the innocent, the wild little Quails
–lived way out in the Chapparal; on a little ranch near the Stanislaus
River, with their father and mother. They were famous for their beauty
and had many suitors.“</p>
<p>The mention of “California plums“ refers to some inedible fruit which
Gillis once, out of pure goodness of heart, bought of a poor wandering
squaw, and then, to conceal his motive, declared that they were
something rare and fine, and persisted in eating them, though even when
stewed they nearly choked him.</p>
