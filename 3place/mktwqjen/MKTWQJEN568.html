<h4 id="chapter-xiii.-going-for-toms-pipe">CHAPTER XIII. GOING FOR TOM’S
PIPE:</h4>
<p>BY AND BY we left Jim to float around up there in the neighborhood of
the pyramids, and we clumb down to the hole where you go into the
tunnel, and went in with some Arabs and candles, and away in there in
the middle of the pyramid we found a room and a big stone box in it
where they used to keep that king, just as the man in the Sunday-school
said; but he was gone, now; somebody had got him. But I didn’t take no
interest in the place, because there could be ghosts there, of course;
not fresh ones, but I don’t like no kind.</p>
<p>So then we come out and got some little donkeys and rode a piece, and
then went in a boat another piece, and then more donkeys, and got to
Cairo; and all the way the road was as smooth and beautiful a road as
ever I see, and had tall date-pa’ms on both sides, and naked children
everywhere, and the men was as red as copper, and fine and strong and
handsome. And the city was a curiosity. Such narrow streets–why, they
were just lanes, and crowded with people with turbans, and women with
veils, and everybody rigged out in blazing bright clothes and all sorts
of colors, and you wondered how the camels and the people got by each
other in such narrow little cracks, but they done it–a perfect jam, you
see, and everybody noisy. The stores warn’t big enough to turn around
in, but you didn’t have to go in; the storekeeper sat tailor fashion on
his counter, smoking his snaky long pipe, and had his things where he
could reach them to sell, and he was just as good as in the street, for
the camel-loads brushed him as they went by.</p>
<p>Now and then a grand person flew by in a carriage with fancy dressed
men running and yelling in front of it and whacking anybody with a long
rod that didn’t get out of the way. And by and by along comes the Sultan
riding horseback at the head of a procession, and fairly took your
breath away his clothes was so splendid; and everybody fell flat and
laid on his stomach while he went by. I forgot, but a feller helped me
to remember. He was one that had a rod and run in front.</p>
<p>There was churches, but they don’t know enough to keep Sunday; they
keep Friday and break the Sabbath. You have to take off your shoes when
you go in. There was crowds of men and boys in the church, setting in
groups on the stone floor and making no end of noise–getting their
lessons by heart, Tom said, out of the Koran, which they think is a
Bible, and people that knows better knows enough to not let on. I never
see such a big church in my life before, and most awful high, it was; it
made you dizzy to look up; our village church at home ain’t a
circumstance to it; if you was to put it in there, people would think it
was a drygoods box.</p>
<p>What I wanted to see was a dervish, because I was interested in
dervishes on accounts of the one that played the trick on the
camel-driver. So we found a lot in a kind of a church, and they called
themselves Whirling Dervishes; and they did whirl, too. I never see
anything like it. They had tall sugar-loaf hats on, and linen
petticoats; and they spun and spun and spun, round and round like tops,
and the petticoats stood out on a slant, and it was the prettiest thing
I ever see, and made me drunk to look at it. They was all Moslems, Tom
said, and when I asked him what a Moslem was, he said it was a person
that wasn’t a Presbyterian. So there is plenty of them in Missouri,
though I didn’t know it before.</p>
<p>We didn’t see half there was to see in Cairo, because Tom was in such
a sweat to hunt out places that was celebrated in history. We had a most
tiresome time to find the granary where Joseph stored up the grain
before the famine, and when we found it it warn’t worth much to look at,
being such an old tumble-down wreck; but Tom was satisfied, and made
more fuss over it than I would make if I stuck a nail in my foot. How he
ever found that place was too many for me. We passed as much as forty
just like it before we come to it, and any of them would ‘a’ done for
me, but none but just the right one would suit him; I never see anybody
so particular as Tom Sawyer. The minute he struck the right one he
reconnized it as easy as I would reconnize my other shirt if I had one,
but how he done it he couldn’t any more tell than he could fly; he said
so himself.</p>
<p>Then we hunted a long time for the house where the boy lived that
learned the cadi how to try the case of the old olives and the new ones,
and said it was out of the Arabian Nights, and he would tell me and Jim
about it when he got time. Well, we hunted and hunted till I was ready
to drop, and I wanted Tom to give it up and come next day and git
somebody that knowed the town and could talk Missourian and could go
straight to the place; but no, he wanted to find it himself, and nothing
else would answer. So on we went. Then at last the remarkablest thing
happened I ever see. The house was gone–gone hundreds of years ago–every
last rag of it gone but just one mud brick. Now a person wouldn’t ever
believe that a backwoods Missouri boy that hadn’t ever been in that town
before could go and hunt that place over and find that brick, but Tom
Sawyer done it. I know he done it, because I see him do it. I was right
by his very side at the time, and see him see the brick and see him
reconnize it. Well, I says to myself, how DOES he do it? Is it
knowledge, or is it instink?</p>
<p>Now there’s the facts, just as they happened: let everybody explain
it their own way. I’ve ciphered over it a good deal, and it’s my opinion
that some of it is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink. The
reason is this: Tom put the brick in his pocket to give to a museum with
his name on it and the facts when he went home, and I slipped it out and
put another brick considerable like it in its place, and he didn’t know
the difference–but there was a difference, you see. I think that settles
it–it’s mostly instink, not knowledge. Instink tells him where the exact
PLACE is for the brick to be in, and so he reconnizes it by the place
it’s in, not by the look of the brick. If it was knowledge, not instink,
he would know the brick again by the look of it the next time he seen
it–which he didn’t. So it shows that for all the brag you hear about
knowledge being such a wonderful thing, instink is worth forty of it for
real unerringness. Jim says the same.</p>
<p>When we got back Jim dropped down and took us in, and there was a
young man there with a red skullcap and tassel on and a beautiful silk
jacket and baggy trousers with a shawl around his waist and pistols in
it that could talk English and wanted to hire to us as guide and take us
to Mecca and Medina and Central Africa and everywheres for a half a
dollar a day and his keep, and we hired him and left, and piled on the
power, and by the time we was through dinner we was over the place where
the Israelites crossed the Red Sea when Pharaoh tried to overtake them
and was caught by the waters. We stopped, then, and had a good look at
the place, and it done Jim good to see it. He said he could see it all,
now, just the way it happened; he could see the Israelites walking along
between the walls of water, and the Egyptians coming, from away off
yonder, hurrying all they could, and see them start in as the Israelites
went out, and then when they was all in, see the walls tumble together
and drown the last man of them. Then we piled on the power again and
rushed away and huvvered over Mount Sinai, and saw the place where Moses
broke the tables of stone, and where the children of Israel camped in
the plain and worshiped the golden calf, and it was all just as
interesting as could be, and the guide knowed every place as well as I
knowed the village at home.</p>
<p>But we had an accident, now, and it fetched all the plans to a
standstill. Tom’s old ornery corn-cob pipe had got so old and swelled
and warped that she couldn’t hold together any longer, notwithstanding
the strings and bandages, but caved in and went to pieces. Tom he didn’t
know WHAT to do. The professor’s pipe wouldn’t answer; it warn’t
anything but a mershum, and a person that’s got used to a cob pipe knows
it lays a long ways over all the other pipes in this world, and you
can’t git him to smoke any other. He wouldn’t take mine, I couldn’t
persuade him. So there he was.</p>
<p>He thought it over, and said we must scour around and see if we could
roust out one in Egypt or Arabia or around in some of these countries,
but the guide said no, it warn’t no use, they didn’t have them. So Tom
was pretty glum for a little while, then he chirked up and said he’d got
the idea and knowed what to do. He says:</p>
<p>“I’ve got another corn-cob pipe, and it’s a prime one, too, and
nearly new. It’s laying on the rafter that’s right over the kitchen
stove at home in the village. Jim, you and the guide will go and get it,
and me and Huck will camp here on Mount Sinai till you come back.“</p>
<p>“But, Mars Tom, we couldn’t ever find de village. I could find de
pipe, ‘case I knows de kitchen, but my lan’, we can’t ever find de
village, nur Sent Louis, nur none o’ dem places. We don’t know de way,
Mars Tom.“</p>
<p>That was a fact, and it stumped Tom for a minute. Then he said:</p>
<p>“Looky here, it can be done, sure; and I’ll tell you how. You set
your compass and sail west as straight as a dart, till you find the
United States. It ain’t any trouble, because it’s the first land you’ll
strike the other side of the Atlantic. If it’s daytime when you strike
it, bulge right on, straight west from the upper part of the Florida
coast, and in an hour and three quarters you’ll hit the mouth of the
Mississippi–at the speed that I’m going to send you. You’ll be so high
up in the air that the earth will be curved considerable–sorter like a
washbowl turned upside down–and you’ll see a raft of rivers crawling
around every which way, long before you get there, and you can pick out
the Mississippi without any trouble. Then you can follow the river north
nearly, an hour and three quarters, till you see the Ohio come in; then
you want to look sharp, because you’re getting near. Away up to your
left you’ll see another thread coming in–that’s the Missouri and is a
little above St. Louis. You’ll come down low then, so as you can examine
the villages as you spin along. You’ll pass about twenty-five in the
next fifteen minutes, and you’ll recognize ours when you see it–and if
you don’t, you can yell down and ask.“</p>
<p>“Ef it’s dat easy, Mars Tom, I reckon we kin do it–yassir, I knows we
kin.“</p>
<p>The guide was sure of it, too, and thought that he could learn to
stand his watch in a little while.</p>
<p>“Jim can learn you the whole thing in a half an hour,“ Tom said.
“This balloon’s as easy to manage as a canoe.“</p>
<p>Tom got out the chart and marked out the course and measured it, and
says:</p>
<p>“To go back west is the shortest way, you see. It’s only about seven
thousand miles. If you went east, and so on around, it’s over twice as
far.“ Then he says to the guide, “I want you both to watch the tell-tale
all through the watches, and whenever it don’t mark three hundred miles
an hour, you go higher or drop lower till you find a storm-current
that’s going your way. There’s a hundred miles an hour in this old thing
without any wind to help. There’s two-hundred-mile gales to be found,
any time you want to hunt for them.“</p>
<p>“We’ll hunt for them, sir.“</p>
<p>“See that you do. Sometimes you may have to go up a couple of miles,
and it’ll be p’ison cold, but most of the time you’ll find your storm a
good deal lower. If you can only strike a cyclone–that’s the ticket for
you! You’ll see by the professor’s books that they travel west in these
latitudes; and they travel low, too.“</p>
<p>Then he ciphered on the time, and says–</p>
<p>“Seven thousand miles, three hundred miles an hour–you can make the
trip in a day–twenty-four hours. This is Thursday; you’ll be back here
Saturday afternoon. Come, now, hustle out some blankets and food and
books and things for me and Huck, and you can start right along. There
ain’t no occasion to fool around–I want a smoke, and the quicker you
fetch that pipe the better.“</p>
<p>All hands jumped for the things, and in eight minutes our things was
out and the balloon was ready for America. So we shook hands good-bye,
and Tom gave his last orders:</p>
<p>“It’s 10 minutes to 2 P.M. now, Mount Sinai time. In 24 hours you’ll
be home, and it’ll be 6 to-morrow morning, village time. When you strike
the village, land a little back of the top of the hill, in the woods,
out of sight; then you rush down, Jim, and shove these letters in the
post-office, and if you see anybody stirring, pull your slouch down over
your face so they won’t know you. Then you go and slip in the back way
to the kitchen and git the pipe, and lay this piece of paper on the
kitchen table, and put something on it to hold it, and then slide out
and git away, and don’t let Aunt Polly catch a sight of you, nor nobody
else. Then you jump for the balloon and shove for Mount Sinai three
hundred miles an hour. You won’t have lost more than an hour. You’ll
start back at 7 or 8 A.M., village time, and be here in 24 hours,
arriving at 2 or 3 P.M., Mount Sinai time.“</p>
<p>Tom he read the piece of paper to us. He had wrote on it:</p>
<p>“THURSDAY AFTERNOON. Tom Sawyer the Erro-nort sends his love to Aunt
Polly from Mount Sinai where the Ark was, and so does Huck Finn, and she
will get it to-morrow morning half-past six.“ *</p>
<p>[* This misplacing of the Ark is probably Huck’s error, not
Tom’s.–M.T.]</p>
<p>“That’ll make her eyes bulge out and the tears come,“ he says. Then
he says:</p>
<p>“Stand by! One–two–three–away you go!“</p>
<p>And away she DID go! Why, she seemed to whiz out of sight in a
second.</p>
<p>Then we found a most comfortable cave that looked out over the whole
big plain, and there we camped to wait for the pipe.</p>
<p>The balloon come hack all right, and brung the pipe; but Aunt Polly
had catched Jim when he was getting it, and anybody can guess what
happened: she sent for Tom. So Jim he says:</p>
<p>“Mars Tom, she’s out on de porch wid her eye sot on de sky a-layin’
for you, en she say she ain’t gwyne to budge from dah tell she gits hold
of you. Dey’s gwyne to be trouble, Mars Tom, ’deed dey is.“</p>
<p>So then we shoved for home, and not feeling very gay, neither.</p>
<p>END.</p>
<p>End of Tom Sawyer Abroad, by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)</p>
<h2 id="the-tragedy-of-puddnhead-wilson">THE TRAGEDY OF PUDD’NHEAD
WILSON</h2>
<p>by Mark Twain</p>
<p>A WHISPER TO THE READER</p>
<p>There is no character, howsoever good and fine, but it can be
destroyed by ridicule, howsoever poor and witless. Observe the ass, for
instance: his character is about perfect, he is the choicest spirit
among all the humbler animals, yet see what ridicule has brought him to.
Instead of feeling complimented when we are called an ass, we are left
in doubt.</p>
<p>–Pudd’nhead Wilson’s Calendar</p>
<p>A person who is ignorant of legal matters is always liable to make
mistakes when he tries to photograph a court scene with his pen; and so
I was not willing to let the law chapters in this book go to press
without first subjecting them to rigid and exhausting revision and
correction by a trained barrister–if that is what they are called. These
chapters are right, now, in every detail, for they were rewritten under
the immediate eye of William Hicks, who studied law part of a while in
southwest Missouri thirty-five years ago and then came over here to
Florence for his health and is still helping for exercise and board in
Macaroni Vermicelli’s horse-feed shed, which is up the back alley as you
turn around the corner out of the Piazza del Duomo just beyond the house
where that stone that Dante used to sit on six hundred years ago is let
into the wall when he let on to be watching them build Giotto’s
campanile and yet always got tired looking as Beatrice passed along on
her way to get a chunk of chestnut cake to defend herself with in case
of a Ghibelline outbreak before she got to school, at the same old stand
where they sell the same old cake to this day and it is just as light
and good as it was then, too, and this is not flattery, far from it. He
was a little rusty on his law, but he rubbed up for this book, and those
two or three legal chapters are right and straight, now. He told me so
himself.</p>
<p>Given under my hand this second day of January, 1893, at the Villa
Viviani, village of Settignano, three miles back of Florence, on the
hills–the same certainly affording the most charming view to be found on
this planet, and with it the most dreamlike and enchanting sunsets to be
found in any planet or even in any solar system–and given, too, in the
swell room of the house, with the busts of Cerretani senators and other
grandees of this line looking approvingly down upon me, as they used to
look down upon Dante, and mutely asking me to adopt them into my family,
which I do with pleasure, for my remotest ancestors are but spring
chickens compared with these robed and stately antiques, and it will be
a great and satisfying lift for me, that six hundred years will.</p>
<p>Mark Twain.</p>
