<h4 id="chapter-xxv-hunted-by-the-little-chamois">Chapter XXV [Hunted by
the Little Chamois]</h4>
<p>Next morning we left in the train for Switzerland, and reached
Lucerne about ten o’clock at night. The first discovery I made was that
the beauty of the lake had not been exaggerated. Within a day or two I
made another discovery. This was, that the lauded chamois is not a wild
goat; that it is not a horned animal; that it is not shy; that it does
not avoid human society; and that there is no peril in hunting it. The
chamois is a black or brown creature no bigger than a mustard seed; you
do not have to go after it, it comes after you; it arrives in vast herds
and skips and scampers all over your body, inside your clothes; thus it
is not shy, but extremely sociable; it is not afraid of man, on the
contrary, it will attack him; its bite is not dangerous, but neither is
it pleasant; its activity has not been overstated –if you try to put
your finger on it, it will skip a thousand times its own length at one
jump, and no eye is sharp enough to see where it lights. A great deal of
romantic nonsense has been written about the Swiss chamois and the
perils of hunting it, whereas the truth is that even women and children
hunt it, and fearlessly; indeed, everybody hunts it; the hunting is
going on all the time, day and night, in bed and out of it. It is poetic
foolishness to hunt it with a gun; very few people do that; there is not
one man in a million who can hit it with a gun. It is much easier to
catch it than it is to shoot it, and only the experienced chamois-hunter
can do either. Another common piece of exaggeration is that about the
“scarcity“ of the chamois. It is the reverse of scarce. Droves of one
hundred million chamois are not unusual in the Swiss hotels. Indeed,
they are so numerous as to be a great pest. The romancers always dress
up the chamois-hunter in a fanciful and picturesque costume, whereas the
best way to hunt this game is to do it without any costume at all. The
article of commerce called chamois-skin is another fraud; nobody could
skin a chamois, it is too small. The creature is a humbug in every way,
and everything which has been written about it is sentimental
exaggeration. It was no pleasure to me to find the chamois out, for he
had been one of my pet illusions; all my life it had been my dream to
see him in his native wilds some day, and engage in the adventurous
sport of chasing him from cliff to cliff. It is no pleasure to me to
expose him, now, and destroy the reader’s delight in him and respect for
him, but still it must be done, for when an honest writer discovers an
imposition it is his simple duty to strip it bare and hurl it down from
its place of honor, no matter who suffers by it; any other course would
render him unworthy of the public confidence.</p>
<p>Lucerne is a charming place. It begins at the water’s edge, with a
fringe of hotels, and scrambles up and spreads itself over two or three
sharp hills in a crowded, disorderly, but picturesque way, offering to
the eye a heaped-up confusion of red roofs, quaint gables, dormer
windows, toothpick steeples, with here and there a bit of ancient
embattled wall bending itself over the ridges, worm-fashion, and here
and there an old square tower of heavy masonry. And also here and there
a town clock with only one hand–a hand which stretches across the dial
and has no joint in it; such a clock helps out the picture, but you
cannot tell the time of day by it. Between the curving line of hotels
and the lake is a broad avenue with lamps and a double rank of low shade
trees. The lake-front is walled with masonry like a pier, and has a
railing, to keep people from walking overboard. All day long the
vehicles dash along the avenue, and nurses, children, and tourists sit
in the shade of the trees, or lean on the railing and watch the schools
of fishes darting about in the clear water, or gaze out over the lake at
the stately border of snow-hooded mountains peaks. Little pleasure
steamers, black with people, are coming and going all the time; and
everywhere one sees young girls and young men paddling about in fanciful
rowboats, or skimming along by the help of sails when there is any wind.
The front rooms of the hotels have little railed balconies, where one
may take his private luncheon in calm, cool comfort and look down upon
this busy and pretty scene and enjoy it without having to do any of the
work connected with it.</p>
<p>Most of the people, both male and female, are in walking costume, and
carry alpenstocks. Evidently, it is not considered safe to go about in
Switzerland, even in town, without an alpenstock. If the tourist forgets
and comes down to breakfast without his alpenstock he goes back and gets
it, and stands it up in the corner. When his touring in Switzerland is
finished, he does not throw that broomstick away, but lugs it home with
him, to the far corners of the earth, although this costs him more
trouble and bother than a baby or a courier could. You see, the
alpenstock is his trophy; his name is burned upon it; and if he has
climbed a hill, or jumped a brook, or traversed a brickyard with it, he
has the names of those places burned upon it, too. Thus it is his
regimental flag, so to speak, and bears the record of his achievements.
It is worth three francs when he buys it, but a bonanza could not
purchase it after his great deeds have been inscribed upon it. There are
artisans all about Switzerland whose trade it is to burn these things
upon the alpenstock of the tourist. And observe, a man is respected in
Switzerland according to his alpenstock. I found I could get no
attention there, while I carried an unbranded one. However, branding is
not expected, so I soon remedied that. The effect upon the next
detachment of tourists was very marked. I felt repaid for my
trouble.</p>
<p>Half of the summer horde in Switzerland is made up of English people;
the other half is made up of many nationalities, the Germans leading and
the Americans coming next. The Americans were not as numerous as I had
expected they would be.</p>
<p>The seven-thirty table d’ho^te at the great Schweitzerhof furnished a
mighty array and variety of nationalities, but it offered a better
opportunity to observe costumes than people, for the multitude sat at
immensely long tables, and therefore the faces were mainly seen in
perspective; but the breakfasts were served at small round tables, and
then if one had the fortune to get a table in the midst of the
assemblage he could have as many faces to study as he could desire. We
used to try to guess out the nationalities, and generally succeeded
tolerably well. Sometimes we tried to guess people’s names; but that was
a failure; that is a thing which probably requires a good deal of
practice. We presently dropped it and gave our efforts to less difficult
particulars. One morning I said:</p>
<p>“There is an American party.“</p>
<p>Harris said:</p>
<p>“Yes–but name the state.“</p>
<p>I named one state, Harris named another. We agreed upon one thing,
however–that the young girl with the party was very beautiful, and very
tastefully dressed. But we disagreed as to her age. I said she was
eighteen, Harris said she was twenty. The dispute between us waxed warm,
and I finally said, with a pretense of being in earnest:</p>
<p>“Well, there is one way to settle the matter–I will go and ask
her.“</p>
<p>Harris said, sarcastically, “Certainly, that is the thing to do. All
you need to do is to use the common formula over here: go and say, ‘I’m
an American!’ Of course she will be glad to see you.“</p>
<p>Then he hinted that perhaps there was no great danger of my venturing
to speak to her.</p>
<p>I said, “I was only talking–I didn’t intend to approach her, but I
see that you do not know what an intrepid person I am. I am not afraid
of any woman that walks. I will go and speak to this young girl.“</p>
<p>The thing I had in my mind was not difficult. I meant to address her
in the most respectful way and ask her to pardon me if her strong
resemblance to a former acquaintance of mine was deceiving me; and when
she should reply that the name I mentioned was not the name she bore, I
meant to beg pardon again, most respectfully, and retire. There would be
no harm done. I walked to her table, bowed to the gentleman, then turned
to her and was about to begin my little speech when she exclaimed:</p>
<p>“I KNEW I wasn’t mistaken–I told John it was you! John said it
probably wasn’t, but I knew I was right. I said you would recognize me
presently and come over; and I’m glad you did, for I shouldn’t have felt
much flattered if you had gone out of this room without recognizing me.
Sit down, sit down–how odd it is–you are the last person I was ever
expecting to see again.“</p>
<p>This was a stupefying surprise. It took my wits clear away, for an
instant. However, we shook hands cordially all around, and I sat down.
But truly this was the tightest place I ever was in. I seemed to vaguely
remember the girl’s face, now, but I had no idea where I had seen it
before, or what named belonged with it. I immediately tried to get up a
diversion about Swiss scenery, to keep her from launching into topics
that might betray that I did not know her, but it was of no use, she
went right along upon matters which interested her more:</p>
<p>“Oh dear, what a night that was, when the sea washed the forward
boats away–do you remember it?“</p>
<p>“Oh, DON’T I!“ said I–but I didn’t. I wished the sea had washed the
rudder and the smoke-stack and the captain away–then I could have
located this questioner.</p>
<p>“And don’t you remember how frightened poor Mary was, and how she
cried?“</p>
<p>“Indeed I do!“ said I. “Dear me, how it all comes back!“</p>
<p>I fervently wished it WOULD come back–but my memory was a blank. The
wise way would have been to frankly own up; but I could not bring myself
to do that, after the young girl had praised me so for recognizing her;
so I went on, deeper and deeper into the mire, hoping for a chance clue
but never getting one. The Unrecognizable continued, with vivacity:</p>
<p>“Do you know, George married Mary, after all?“</p>
<p>“Why, no! Did he?“</p>
<p>“Indeed he did. He said he did not believe she was half as much to
blame as her father was, and I thought he was right. Didn’t you?“</p>
<p>“Of course he was. It was a perfectly plain case. I always said
so.“</p>
<p>“Why, no you didn’t!–at least that summer.“</p>
<p>“Oh, no, not that summer. No, you are perfectly right about that. It
was the following winter that I said it.“</p>
<p>“Well, as it turned out, Mary was not in the least to blame –it was
all her father’s fault–at least his and old Darley’s.“</p>
<p>It was necessary to say something–so I said:</p>
<p>“I always regarded Darley as a troublesome old thing.“</p>
<p>“So he was, but then they always had a great affection for him,
although he had so many eccentricities. You remember that when the
weather was the least cold, he would try to come into the house.“</p>
<p>I was rather afraid to proceed. Evidently Darley was not a man–he
must be some other kind of animal–possibly a dog, maybe an elephant.
However, tails are common to all animals, so I ventured to say:</p>
<p>“And what a tail he had!“</p>
<p>“ONE! He had a thousand!“</p>
<p>This was bewildering. I did not quite know what to say, so I only
said:</p>
<p>“Yes, he WAS rather well fixed in the matter of tails.“</p>
<p>“For a negro, and a crazy one at that, I should say he was,“ said
she.</p>
<p>It was getting pretty sultry for me. I said to myself, “Is it
possible she is going to stop there, and wait for me to speak? If she
does, the conversation is blocked. A negro with a thousand tails is a
topic which a person cannot talk upon fluently and instructively without
more or less preparation. As to diving rashly into such a vast
subject–“</p>
<p>But here, to my gratitude, she interrupted my thoughts by saying:</p>
<p>“Yes, when it came to tales of his crazy woes, there was simply no
end to them if anybody would listen. His own quarters were comfortable
enough, but when the weather was cold, the family were sure to have his
company–nothing could keep him out of the house. But they always bore it
kindly because he had saved Tom’s life, years before. You remember
Tom?</p>
<p>“Oh, perfectly. Fine fellow he was, too.“</p>
<p>“Yes he was. And what a pretty little thing his child was!“</p>
<p>“You may well say that. I never saw a prettier child.“</p>
<p>“I used to delight to pet it and dandle it and play with it.“</p>
<p>“So did I.“</p>
<p>“You named it. What WAS that name? I can’t call it to mind.“</p>
<p>It appeared to me that the ice was getting pretty thin, here. I would
have given something to know what the child’s was. However, I had the
good luck to think of a name that would fit either sex–so I brought it
out:</p>
<p>“I named it Frances.“</p>
<p>“From a relative, I suppose? But you named the one that died, too–one
that I never saw. What did you call that one?“</p>
<p>I was out of neutral names, but as the child was dead and she had
never seen it, I thought I might risk a name for it and trust to luck.
Therefore I said:</p>
<p>“I called that one Thomas Henry.“</p>
<p>She said, musingly:</p>
<p>“That is very singular … very singular.“</p>
<p>I sat still and let the cold sweat run down. I was in a good deal of
trouble, but I believed I could worry through if she wouldn’t ask me to
name any more children. I wondered where the lightning was going to
strike next. She was still ruminating over that last child’s title, but
presently she said:</p>
<p>“I have always been sorry you were away at the time–I would have had
you name my child.“</p>
<p>“YOUR child! Are you married?“</p>
<p>“I have been married thirteen years.“</p>
<p>“Christened, you mean.“</p>
<p>`“No, married. The youth by your side is my son.“</p>
<p>“It seems incredible–even impossible. I do not mean any harm by it,
but would you mind telling me if you are any over eighteen?–that is to
say, will you tell me how old you are?“</p>
<p>“I was just nineteen the day of the storm we were talking about. That
was my birthday.“</p>
<p>That did not help matters, much, as I did not know the date of the
storm. I tried to think of some non-committal thing to say, to keep up
my end of the talk, and render my poverty in the matter of reminiscences
as little noticeable as possible, but I seemed to be about out of
non-committal things. I was about to say, “You haven’t changed a bit
since then“–but that was risky. I thought of saying, “You have improved
ever so much since then“–but that wouldn’t answer, of course. I was
about to try a shy at the weather, for a saving change, when the girl
slipped in ahead of me and said:</p>
<p>“How I have enjoyed this talk over those happy old times –haven’t
you?“</p>
<p>“I never have spent such a half-hour in all my life before!“ said I,
with emotion; and I could have added, with a near approach to truth,
“and I would rather be scalped than spend another one like it.“ I was
holily grateful to be through with the ordeal, and was about to make my
good-bys and get out, when the girl said:</p>
<p>“But there is one thing that is ever so puzzling to me.“</p>
<p>“Why, what is that?“</p>
<p>“That dead child’s name. What did you say it was?“</p>
<p>Here was another balmy place to be in: I had forgotten the child’s
name; I hadn’t imagined it would be needed again. However, I had to
pretend to know, anyway, so I said:</p>
<p>“Joseph William.“</p>
<p>The youth at my side corrected me, and said:</p>
<p>“No, Thomas Henry.“</p>
<p>I thanked him–in words–and said, with trepidation:</p>
<p>“O yes–I was thinking of another child that I named–I have named a
great many, and I get them confused–this one was named Henry
Thompson–“</p>
<p>“Thomas Henry,“ calmly interposed the boy.</p>
<p>I thanked him again–strictly in words–and stammered out:</p>
<p>“Thomas Henry–yes, Thomas Henry was the poor child’s name. I named
him for Thomas–er–Thomas Carlyle, the great author, you know–and
Henry–er–er–Henry the Eight. The parents were very grateful to have a
child named Thomas Henry.“</p>
<p>“That makes it more singular than ever,“ murmured my beautiful
friend.</p>
<p>“Does it? Why?“</p>
<p>“Because when the parents speak of that child now, they always call
it Susan Amelia.“</p>
<p>That spiked my gun. I could not say anything. I was entirely out of
verbal obliquities; to go further would be to lie, and that I would not
do; so I simply sat still and suffered –sat mutely and resignedly there,
and sizzled–for I was being slowly fried to death in my own blushes.
Presently the enemy laughed a happy laugh and said:</p>
<p>“I HAVE enjoyed this talk over old times, but you have not. I saw
very soon that you were only pretending to know me, and so as I had
wasted a compliment on you in the beginning, I made up my mind to punish
you. And I have succeeded pretty well. I was glad to see that you knew
George and Tom and Darley, for I had never heard of them before and
therefore could not be sure that you had; and I was glad to learn the
names of those imaginary children, too. One can get quite a fund of
information out of you if one goes at it cleverly. Mary and the storm,
and the sweeping away of the forward boats, were facts–all the rest was
fiction. Mary was my sister; her full name was Mary ——. NOW do you
remember me?“</p>
<p>“Yes,“ I said, “I do remember you now; and you are as hard-headed as
you were thirteen years ago in that ship, else you wouldn’t have
punished me so. You haven’t change your nature nor your person, in any
way at all; you look as young as you did then, you are just as beautiful
as you were then, and you have transmitted a deal of your comeliness to
this fine boy. There–if that speech moves you any, let’s fly the flag of
truce, with the understanding that I am conquered and confess it.“</p>
<p>All of which was agreed to and accomplished, on the spot. When I went
back to Harris, I said:</p>
<p>“Now you see what a person with talent and address can do.“</p>
<p>“Excuse me, I see what a person of colossal ignorance and simplicity
can do. The idea of your going and intruding on a party of strangers,
that way, and talking for half an hour; why I never heard of a man in
his right mind doing such a thing before. What did you say to them?“</p>
<p>I never said any harm. I merely asked the girl what her name
was.“</p>
<p>“I don’t doubt it. Upon my word I don’t. I think you were capable of
it. It was stupid in me to let you go over there and make such an
exhibition of yourself. But you know I couldn’t really believe you would
do such an inexcusable thing. What will those people think of us? But
how did you say it?–I mean the manner of it. I hope you were not
abrupt.“</p>
<p>“No, I was careful about that. I said, ‘My friend and I would like to
know what your name is, if you don’t mind.’“</p>
<p>“No, that was not abrupt. There is a polish about it that does you
infinite credit. And I am glad you put me in; that was a delicate
attention which I appreciate at its full value. What did she do?“</p>
<p>“She didn’t do anything in particular. She told me her name.“</p>
<p>“Simply told you her name. Do you mean to say she did not show any
surprise?“</p>
<p>“Well, now I come to think, she did show something; maybe it was
surprise; I hadn’t thought of that–I took it for gratification.“</p>
<p>“Oh, undoubtedly you were right; it must have been gratification; it
could not be otherwise than gratifying to be assaulted by a stranger
with such a question as that. Then what did you do?“</p>
<p>“I offered my hand and the party gave me a shake.“</p>
<p>“I saw it! I did not believe my own eyes, at the time. Did the
gentleman say anything about cutting your throat?“</p>
<p>“No, they all seemed glad to see me, as far as I could judge.“</p>
<p>“And do you know, I believe they were. I think they said to
themselves, ‘Doubtless this curiosity has got away from his keeper–let
us amuse ourselves with him.’ There is no other way of accounting for
their facile docility. You sat down. Did they ASK you to sit down?“</p>
<p>“No, they did not ask me, but I suppose they did not think of
it.“</p>
<p>“You have an unerring instinct. What else did you do? What did you
talk about?“</p>
<p>“Well, I asked the girl how old she was.“</p>
<p>“UNdoubtedly. Your delicacy is beyond praise. Go on, go on–don’t mind
my apparent misery–I always look so when I am steeped in a profound and
reverent joy. Go on–she told you her age?“</p>
<p>“Yes, she told me her age, and all about her mother, and her
grandmother, and her other relations, and all about herself.“</p>
<p>“Did she volunteer these statistics?“</p>
<p>“No, not exactly that. I asked the questions and she answered
them.“</p>
<p>“This is divine. Go on–it is not possible that you forgot to inquire
into her politics?“</p>
<p>“No, I thought of that. She is a democrat, her husband is a
republican, and both of them are Baptists.“</p>
<p>“Her husband? Is that child married?“</p>
<p>“She is not a child. She is married, and that is her husband who is
there with her.“</p>
<p>“Has she any children.“</p>
<p>“Yes–seven and a half.“</p>
<p>“That is impossible.“</p>
<p>“No, she has them. She told me herself.“</p>
<p>“Well, but seven and a HALF? How do you make out the half? Where does
the half come in?“</p>
<p>“There is a child which she had by another husband –not this one but
another one–so it is a stepchild, and they do not count in full
measure.“</p>
<p>“Another husband? Has she another husband?“</p>
<p>“Yes, four. This one is number four.“</p>
<p>“I don’t believe a word of it. It is impossible, upon its face. Is
that boy there her brother?“</p>
<p>“No, that is her son. He is her youngest. He is not as old as he
looked; he is only eleven and a half.“</p>
<p>“These things are all manifestly impossible. This is a wretched
business. It is a plain case: they simply took your measure, and
concluded to fill you up. They seem to have succeeded. I am glad I am
not in the mess; they may at least be charitable enough to think there
ain’t a pair of us. Are they going to stay here long?“</p>
<p>“No, they leave before noon.“</p>
<p>“There is one man who is deeply grateful for that. How did you find
out? You asked, I suppose?“</p>
<p>“No, along at first I inquired into their plans, in a general way,
and they said they were going to be here a week, and make trips round
about; but toward the end of the interview, when I said you and I would
tour around with them with pleasure, and offered to bring you over and
introduce you, they hesitated a little, and asked if you were from the
same establishment that I was. I said you were, and then they said they
had changed their mind and considered it necessary to start at once and
visit a sick relative in Siberia.“</p>
<p>“Ah, me, you struck the summit! You struck the loftiest altitude of
stupidity that human effort has ever reached. You shall have a monument
of jackasses’ skulls as high as the Strasburg spire if you die before I
do. They wanted to know I was from the same ‘establishment’ that you
hailed from, did they? What did they mean by ‘establishment’?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know; it never occurred to me to ask.“</p>
<p>“Well <em>I</em> know– they meant an asylum– an IDIOT asylum, do you
understand? So they DO think there’s a pair of us, after all. Now what
do you think of yourself?“</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know. I didn’t know I was doing any harm; I didn’t
MEAN to do any harm. They were very nice people, and they seemed to like
me.“</p>
<p>Harris made some rude remarks and left for his bedroom –to break some
furniture, he said. He was a singularly irascible man; any little thing
would disturb his temper.</p>
<p>I had been well scorched by the young woman, but no matter, I took it
out on Harris. One should always “get even“ in some way, else the sore
place will go on hurting.</p>
