1883, TO HOWELLS AND OTHERS. A GUEST OF THE MARQUIS OF LORNE. THE
HISTORY GAME. A PLAY BY HOWELLS AND MARK TWAIN</h4>
<p>Mark Twain, in due season, finished the Mississippi book and placed
it in Osgood’s hands for publication. It was a sort of partnership
arrangement in which Clemens was to furnish the money to make the book,
and pay Osgood a percentage for handling it. It was, in fact, the
beginning of Mark Twain’s adventures as a publisher.</p>
<p>Howells was not as happy in Florence as he had hoped to be. The
social life there overwhelmed him. In February he wrote: “Our two months
in Florence have been the most ridiculous time that ever even
half-witted people passed. We have spent them in chasing round after
people for whom we cared nothing, and being chased by them. My story
isn’t finished yet, and what part of it is done bears the fatal marks of
haste and distraction. Of course, I haven’t put pen to paper yet on the
play. I wring my hands and beat my breast when I think of how these
weeks have been wasted; and how I have been forced to waste them by the
infernal social circumstances from which I couldn’t escape.“</p>
<p>Clemens, now free from the burden of his own book, was light of heart
and full of ideas and news; also of sympathy and appreciation. Howells’s
story of this time was “A Woman’s Reason.“ Governor Jewell, of this
letter, was Marshall Jewell, Governor of Connecticut from 1871 to 1873.
Later, he was Minister to Russia, and in 1874 was United States
Postmaster-General.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Florence:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, March 1st, 1883. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–We got ourselves ground
up in that same mill, once, in London, and another time in Paris. It is
a kind of foretaste of hell. There is no way to avoid it except by the
method which you have now chosen. One must live secretly and cut himself
utterly off from the human race, or life in Europe becomes an unbearable
burden and work an impossibility. I learned something last night, and
maybe it may reconcile me to go to Europe again sometime. I attended one
of the astonishingly popular lectures of a man by the name of Stoddard,
who exhibits interesting stereopticon pictures and then knocks the
interest all out of them with his comments upon them. But all the world
go there to look and listen, and are apparently well satisfied. And they
ought to be fully satisfied, if the lecturer would only keep still, or
die in the first act. But he described how retired tradesmen and farmers
in Holland load a lazy scow with the family and the household effects,
and then loaf along the waterways of the low countries all the summer
long, paying no visits, receiving none, and just lazying a heavenly life
out in their own private unpestered society, and doing their literary
work, if they have any, wholly uninterrupted. If you had hired such a
boat and sent for us we should have a couple of satisfactory books ready
for the press now with no marks of interruption, vexatious wearinesses,
and other hellishnesses visible upon them anywhere. We shall have to do
this another time. We have lost an opportunity for the present. Do you
forget that Heaven is packed with a multitude of all nations and that
these people are all on the most familiar how-the-hell-are-you footing
with Talmage swinging around the circle to all eternity hugging the
saints and patriarchs and archangels, and forcing you to do the same
unless you choose to make yourself an object of remark if you refrain?
Then why do you try to get to Heaven? Be warned in time.</p>
<p>We have all read your two opening numbers in the Century, and
consider them almost beyond praise. I hear no dissent from this verdict.
I did not know there was an untouched personage in American life, but I
had forgotten the auctioneer. You have photographed him accurately.</p>
<p>I have been an utterly free person for a month or two; and I do not
believe I ever so greatly appreciated and enjoyed–and realized the
absence of the chains of slavery as I do this time. Usually my first
waking thought in the morning is, “I have nothing to do to-day, I belong
to nobody, I have ceased from being a slave.“ Of course the highest
pleasure to be got out of freedom, and having nothing to do, is labor.
Therefore I labor. But I take my time about it. I work one hour or four
as happens to suit my mind, and quit when I please. And so these days
are days of entire enjoyment. I told Clark the other day, to jog along
comfortable and not get in a sweat. I said I believed you would not be
able to enjoy editing that library over there, where you have your own
legitimate work to do and be pestered to death by society besides;
therefore I thought if he got it ready for you against your return, that
that would be best and pleasantest.</p>
<p>You remember Governor Jewell, and the night he told about Russia,
down in the library. He was taken with a cold about three weeks ago, and
I stepped over one evening, proposing to beguile an idle hour for him
with a yarn or two, but was received at the door with whispers, and the
information that he was dying. His case had been dangerous during that
day only and he died that night, two hours after I left. His taking off
was a prodigious surprise, and his death has been most widely and
sincerely regretted. Win. E. Dodge, the father-in-law of one of Jewell’s
daughters, dropped suddenly dead the day before Jewell died, but Jewell
died without knowing that. Jewell’s widow went down to New York, to
Dodge’s house, the day after Jewell’s funeral, and was to return here
day before yesterday, and she did–in a coffin. She fell dead, of heart
disease, while her trunks were being packed for her return home.
Florence Strong, one of Jewell’s daughters, who lives in Detroit,
started East on an urgent telegram, but missed a connection somewhere,
and did not arrive here in time to see her father alive. She was his
favorite child, and they had always been like lovers together. He always
sent her a box of fresh flowers once a week to the day of his death; a
custom which he never suspended even when he was in Russia. Mrs. Strong
had only just reached her Western home again when she was summoned to
Hartford to attend her mother’s funeral.</p>
<p>I have had the impulse to write you several times. I shall try to
remember better henceforth.</p>
<p>With sincerest regards to all of you, Yours as ever, MARK.</p>
<p>Mark Twain made another trip to Canada in the interest of copyright
–this time to protect the Mississippi book. When his journey was
announced by the press, the Marquis of Lorne telegraphed an invitation
inviting him to be his guest at Rideau Hall, in Ottawa. Clemens
accepted, of course, and was handsomely entertained by the daughter of
Queen Victoria and her husband, then Governor-General of Canada.</p>
<p>On his return to Hartford he found that Osgood had issued a curious
little book, for which Clemens had prepared an introduction. It was an
absurd volume, though originally issued with serious intent, its title
being The New Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese and English.’–[The
New Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese and English, by Pedro
Caxolino, with an introduction by Mark Twain. Osgood, Boston, 1883.
]–Evidently the “New Guide“ was prepared by some simple Portuguese soul
with but slight knowledge of English beyond that which could be obtained
from a dictionary, and his literal translation of English idioms are
often startling, as, for instance, this one, taken at random:</p>
<p>“A little learneds are happies enough for to may to satisfy their
fancies on the literature.“</p>
<p>Mark Twain thought this quaint book might amuse his royal hostess,
and forwarded a copy in what he considered to be the safe and proper
form.</p>
<p>To Col. De Winton, in Ottawa, Canada:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, June 4, ’83. DEAR COLONEL DE WINTON,–I very much want to
send a little book to her Royal Highness–the famous Portuguese phrase
book; but I do not know the etiquette of the matter, and I would not
wittingly infringe any rule of propriety. It is a book which I perfectly
well know will amuse her “some at most“ if she has not seen it before,
and will still amuse her “some at least,“ even if she has inspected it a
hundred times already. So I will send the book to you, and you who know
all about the proper observances will protect me from indiscretion, in
case of need, by putting the said book in the fire, and remaining as
dumb as I generally was when I was up there. I do not rebind the thing,
because that would look as if I thought it worth keeping, whereas it is
only worth glancing at and casting aside.</p>
<p>Will you please present my compliments to Mrs. De Winton and
Mrs. Mackenzie?–and I beg to make my sincere compliments to you, also,
for your infinite kindnesses to me. I did have a delightful time up
there, most certainly. Truly yours S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>P. S. Although the introduction dates a year back, the book is only
just now issued. A good long delay.</p>
<p>S. L. C.</p>
<p>Howells, writing from Venice, in April, manifested special interest
in the play project: “Something that would run like Scheherazade, for a
thousand and one nights,“ so perhaps his book was going better. He
proposed that they devote the month of October to the work, and inclosed
a letter from Mallory, who owned not only a religious paper, The
Churchman, but also the Madison Square Theater, and was anxious for a
Howells play. Twenty years before Howells had been Consul to Venice, and
he wrote, now: “The idea of my being here is benumbing and silencing. I
feel like the Wandering Jew, or the ghost of the Cardiff giant.“</p>
<p>He returned to America in July. Clemens sent him word of welcome,
with glowing reports of his own undertakings. The story on which he was
piling up MS. was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, begun seven years
before at Quarry Farm. He had no great faith in it then, and though he
had taken it up again in 1880, his interest had not lasted to its
conclusion. This time, however, he was in the proper spirit, and the
story would be finished.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, July 20, ’83. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–We are desperately glad you
and your gang are home again–may you never travel again, till you go
aloft or alow. Charley Clark has gone to the other side for a run–will
be back in August. He has been sick, and needed the trip very much.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens had a long and wasting spell of sickness last Spring,
but she is pulling up, now. The children are booming, and my health is
ridiculous, it’s so robust, notwithstanding the newspaper
misreports.</p>
<p>I haven’t piled up MS so in years as I have done since we came here
to the farm three weeks and a half ago. Why, it’s like old times, to
step right into the study, damp from the breakfast table, and sail right
in and sail right on, the whole day long, without thought of running
short of stuff or words.</p>
<p>I wrote 4000 words to-day and I touch 3000 and upwards pretty often,
and don’t fall below 1600 any working day. And when I get fagged out, I
lie abed a couple of days and read and smoke, and then go it again for 6
or 7 days. I have finished one small book, and am away along in a big
433 one that I half-finished two or three years ago. I expect to
complete it in a month or six weeks or two months more. And I shall like
it, whether anybody else does or not.</p>
<p>It’s a kind of companion to Tom Sawyer. There’s a raft episode from
it in second or third chapter of life on the Mississippi…..</p>
<p>I’m booming, these days–got health and spirits to waste–got an
overplus; and if I were at home, we would write a play. But we must do
it anyhow by and by.</p>
<p>We stay here till Sep. 10; then maybe a week at Indian Neck for sea
air, then home.</p>
<p>We are powerful glad you are all back; and send love according.</p>
<p>Yrs Ever MARK</p>
<p>To Onion Clemens and family, in Keokuk, Id.:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, July 22, ’83. Private.</p>
<p>DEAR MA AND ORION AND MOLLIE,–I don’t know that I have anything new
to report, except that Livy is still gaining, and all the rest of us
flourishing. I haven’t had such booming working-days for many years. I
am piling up manuscript in a really astonishing way. I believe I shall
complete, in two months, a book which I have been fooling over for 7
years. This summer it is no more trouble to me to write than it is to
lie.</p>
<p>Day before yesterday I felt slightly warned to knock off work for one
day. So I did it, and took the open air. Then I struck an idea for the
instruction of the children, and went to work and carried it out. It
took me all day. I measured off 817 feet of the road-way in our farm
grounds, with a foot-rule, and then divided it up among the English
reigns, from the Conqueror down to 1883, allowing one foot to the year.
I whittled out a basket of little pegs and drove one in the ground at
the beginning of each reign, and gave it that King’s name–thus:</p>
<p>I measured all the reigns exactly as many feet to the reign as there
were years in it. You can look out over the grounds and see the little
pegs from the front door–some of them close together, like Richard II,
Richard Cromwell, James II, andandandandc; and some prodigiously wide
apart, like Henry III, Edward III, George III, andandandandc. It gives
the children a realizing sense of the length or brevity of a reign.
Shall invent a violent game to go with it.</p>
<p>And in bed, last night, I invented a way to play it indoors–in a far
more voluminous way, as to multiplicity of dates and events–on a
cribbage board.</p>
<p>Hello, supper’s ready. Love to all. Good bye. SAML.</p>
<p>Onion Clemens would naturally get excited over the idea of the game
and its commercial possibilities. Not more so than his brother, however,
who presently employed him to arrange a quantity of historical data
which the game was to teach. For a season, indeed, interest in the game
became a sort of midsummer madness which pervaded the two households, at
Keokuk and at Quarry Farm. Howells wrote his approval of the idea of
“learning history by the running foot,“ which was a pun, even if
unintentional, for in its out-door form it was a game of speed as well
as knowledge.</p>
<p>Howells adds that he has noticed that the newspapers are exploiting
Mark Twain’s new invention of a history game, and we shall presently see
how this happened.</p>
<p>Also, in this letter, Howells speaks of an English nobleman to whom
he has given a letter of introduction. “He seemed a simple, quiet,
gentlemanly man, with a good taste in literature, which he evinced by
going about with my books in his pockets, and talking of yours.“</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>MY DEAR HOWELLS,–How odd it seems, to sit down to write a letter with
the feeling that you’ve got time to do it. But I’m done work, for this
season, and so have got time. I’ve done two seasons’ work in one, and
haven’t anything left to do, now, but revise. I’ve written eight or nine
hundred MS pages in such a brief space of time that I mustn’t name the
number of days; I shouldn’t believe it myself, and of course couldn’t
expect you to. I used to restrict myself to 4 or 5 hours a day and 5
days in the week, but this time I’ve wrought from breakfast till 5.15
p.m. six days in the week; and once or twice I smouched a Sunday when
the boss wasn’t looking. Nothing is half so good as literature hooked on
Sunday, on the sly.</p>
<p>I wrote you and Twichell on the same night, about the game, and was
appalled to get a note from him saying he was going to print part of my
letter, and was going to do it before I could get a chance to forbid it.
I telegraphed him, but was of course too late.</p>
<p>If you haven’t ever tried to invent an indoor historical game, don’t.
I’ve got the thing at last so it will work, I guess, but I don’t want
any more tasks of that kind. When I wrote you, I thought I had it;
whereas I was only merely entering upon the initiatory difficulties of
it. I might have known it wouldn’t be an easy job, or somebody would
have invented a decent historical game long ago–a thing which nobody had
done. I think I’ve got it in pretty fair shape–so I have caveated
it.</p>
<p>Earl of Onston–is that it? All right, we shall be very glad to
receive them and get acquainted with them. And much obliged to you, too.
There’s plenty of worse people than the nobilities. I went up and spent
a week with the Marquis and the Princess Louise, and had as good a time
as I want.</p>
<p>I’m powerful glad you are all back again; and we will come up there
if our little tribe will give us the necessary furlough; and if we can’t
get it, you folks must come to us and give us an extension of time. We
get home Sept. 11.</p>
<p>Hello, I think I see Waring coming!</p>
<p>Good-by-letter from Clark, which explains for him.</p>
<p>Love to you all from the CLEMENSES.</p>
<p>No–it wasn’t Waring. I wonder what the devil has become of that man.
He was to spend to-day with us, and the day’s most gone, now.</p>
<p>We are enjoying your story with our usual unspeakableness; and I’m
right glad you threw in the shipwreck and the mystery–I like it.
Mrs. Crane thinks it’s the best story you’ve written yet. We–but we
always think the last one is the best. And why shouldn’t it be? Practice
helps.</p>
<p>P. S. I thought I had sent all our loves to all of you, but
Mrs. Clemens says I haven’t. Damn it, a body can’t think of everything;
but a woman thinks you can. I better seal this, now–else there’ll be
more criticism.</p>
<p>I perceive I haven’t got the love in, yet. Well, we do send the love
of all the family to all the Howellses. S. L. C.</p>
<p>There had been some delay and postponement in the matter of the play
which Howells and Clemens agreed to write. They did not put in the
entire month of October as they had planned, but they did put in a
portion of that month, the latter half, working out their old idea. In
the end it became a revival of Colonel Sellers, or rather a caricature
of that gentle hearted old visionary. Clemens had always complained that
the actor Raymond had never brought out the finer shades of Colonel
Sellers’s character, but Raymond in his worst performance never belied
his original as did Howells and Clemens in his dramatic revival. These
two, working together, let their imaginations run riot with disastrous
results. The reader can judge something of this himself, from The
American Claimant the book which Mark Twain would later build from the
play.</p>
<p>But at this time they thought it a great triumph. They had “cracked
their sides“ laughing over its construction, as Howells once said, and
they thought the world would do the same over its performance. They
decided to offer it to Raymond, but rather haughtily, indifferently,
because any number of other actors would be waiting for it.</p>
<p>But this was a miscalculation. Raymond now turned the tables. Though
favorable to the idea of a new play, he declared this one did not
present his old Sellers at all, but a lunatic. In the end he returned
the MS. with a brief note. Attempts had already been made to interest
other actors, and would continue for some time.</p>
