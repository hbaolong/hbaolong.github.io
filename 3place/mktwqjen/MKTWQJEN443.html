<h4 id="chapter-60-speculations-and-conclusions">Chapter 60 Speculations
and Conclusions</h4>
<p>WE reached St. Paul, at the head of navigation of the Mississippi,
and there our voyage of two thousand miles from New Orleans ended. It is
about a ten-day trip by steamer. It can probably be done quicker by
rail. I judge so because I know that one may go by rail from St. Louis
to Hannibal–a distance of at least a hundred and twenty miles–in seven
hours. This is better than walking; unless one is in a hurry.</p>
<p>The season being far advanced when we were in New Orleans, the roses
and magnolia blossoms were falling; but here in St. Paul it was the
snow, In New Orleans we had caught an occasional withering breath from
over a crater, apparently; here in St. Paul we caught a frequent
benumbing one from over a glacier, apparently.</p>
<p>But I wander from my theme. St. Paul is a wonderful town. It is put
together in solid blocks of honest brick and stone, and has the air of
intending to stay. Its post-office was established thirty-six years ago;
and by and by, when the postmaster received a letter, he carried it to
Washington, horseback, to inquire what was to be done with it. Such is
the legend. Two frame houses were built that year, and several persons
were added to the population. A recent number of the leading St. Paul
paper, the ‘Pioneer Press,’ gives some statistics which furnish a vivid
contrast to that old state of things, to wit: Population, autumn of the
present year (1882), 71,000; number of letters handled, first half of
the year, 1,209,387; number of houses built during three- quarters of
the year, 989; their cost, ,186,000. The increase of letters over the
corresponding six months of last year was fifty per cent. Last year the
new buildings added to the city cost above ,500,000. St. Paul’s strength
lies in her commerce–I mean his commerce. He is a manufacturing city, of
course–all the cities of that region are–but he is peculiarly strong in
the matter of commerce. Last year his jobbing trade amounted to upwards
of 2,000,000.</p>
<p>He has a custom-house, and is building a costly capitol to replace
the one recently burned–for he is the capital of the State. He has
churches without end; and not the cheap poor kind, but the kind that the
rich Protestant puts up, the kind that the poor Irish ‘hired-girl’
delights to erect. What a passion for building majestic churches the
Irish hired-girl has. It is a fine thing for our architecture but too
often we enjoy her stately fanes without giving her a grateful thought.
In fact, instead of reflecting that ‘every brick and every stone in this
beautiful edifice represents an ache or a pain, and a handful of sweat,
and hours of heavy fatigue, contributed by the back and forehead and
bones of poverty,’ it is our habit to forget these things entirely, and
merely glorify the mighty temple itself, without vouchsafing one
praiseful thought to its humble builder, whose rich heart and withered
purse it symbolizes.</p>
<p>This is a land of libraries and schools. St. Paul has three public
libraries, and they contain, in the aggregate, some forty thousand
books. He has one hundred and sixteen school-houses, and pays out more
than seventy thousand dollars a year in teachers’ salaries.</p>
<p>There is an unusually fine railway station; so large is it, in fact,
that it seemed somewhat overdone, in the matter of size, at first; but
at the end of a few months it was perceived that the mistake was
distinctly the other way. The error is to be corrected.</p>
<p>The town stands on high ground; it is about seven hundred feet above
the sea level. It is so high that a wide view of river and lowland is
offered from its streets.</p>
<p>It is a very wonderful town indeed, and is not finished yet. All the
streets are obstructed with building material, and this is being
compacted into houses as fast as possible, to make room for more–for
other people are anxious to build, as soon as they can get the use of
the streets to pile up their bricks and stuff in.</p>
<p>How solemn and beautiful is the thought, that the earliest pioneer of
civilization, the van-leader of civilization, is never the steamboat,
never the railroad, never the newspaper, never the Sabbath-school, never
the missionary–but always whiskey! Such is the case. Look history over;
you will see. The missionary comes after the whiskey–I mean he arrives
after the whiskey has arrived; next comes the poor immigrant, with ax
and hoe and rifle; next, the trader; next, the miscellaneous rush; next,
the gambler, the desperado, the highwayman, and all their kindred in sin
of both sexes; and next, the smart chap who has bought up an old grant
that covers all the land; this brings the lawyer tribe; the vigilance
committee brings the undertaker. All these interests bring the
newspaper; the newspaper starts up politics and a railroad; all hands
turn to and build a church and a jail–and behold, civilization is
established for ever in the land. But whiskey, you see, was the van-
leader in this beneficent work. It always is. It was like a foreigner–
and excusable in a foreigner–to be ignorant of this great truth, and
wander off into astronomy to borrow a symbol. But if he had been
conversant with the facts, he would have said–</p>
<p>Westward the Jug of Empire takes its way.</p>
<p>This great van-leader arrived upon the ground which St. Paul now
occupies, in June 1837. Yes, at that date, Pierre Parrant, a Canadian,
built the first cabin, uncorked his jug, and began to sell whiskey to
the Indians. The result is before us.</p>
<p>All that I have said of the newness, briskness, swift progress,
wealth, intelligence, fine and substantial architecture, and general
slash and go, and energy of St. Paul, will apply to his near neighbor,
Minneapolis–with the addition that the latter is the bigger of the two
cities.</p>
<p>These extraordinary towns were ten miles apart, a few months ago, but
were growing so fast that they may possibly be joined now, and getting
along under a single mayor. At any rate, within five years from now
there will be at least such a substantial ligament of buildings
stretching between them and uniting them that a stranger will not be
able to tell where the one Siamese twin leaves off and the other begins.
Combined, they will then number a population of two hundred and fifty
thousand, if they continue to grow as they are now growing. Thus, this
center of population at the head of Mississippi navigation, will then
begin a rivalry as to numbers, with that center of population at the
foot of it–New Orleans.</p>
<p>Minneapolis is situated at the falls of St. Anthony, which stretch
across the river, fifteen hundred feet, and have a fall of eighty-two
feet–a waterpower which, by art, has been made of inestimable value,
business-wise, though somewhat to the damage of the Falls as a
spectacle, or as a background against which to get your photograph
taken.</p>
<p>Thirty flouring-mills turn out two million barrels of the very
choicest of flour every year; twenty sawmills produce two hundred
million feet of lumber annually; then there are woolen mills, cotton
mills, paper and oil mills; and sash, nail, furniture, barrel, and other
factories, without number, so to speak. The great flouring-mills here
and at St. Paul use the ‘new process’ and mash the wheat by rolling,
instead of grinding it.</p>
<p>Sixteen railroads meet in Minneapolis, and sixty-five passenger
trains arrive and depart daily. In this place, as in St. Paul,
journalism thrives. Here there are three great dailies, ten weeklies,
and three monthlies.</p>
<p>There is a university, with four hundred students–and, better still,
its good efforts are not confined to enlightening the one sex. There are
sixteen public schools, with buildings which cost 00,000; there are six
thousand pupils and one hundred and twenty-eight teachers. There are
also seventy churches existing, and a lot more projected. The banks
aggregate a capital of ,000,000, and the wholesale jobbing trade of the
town amounts to 0,000,000 a year.</p>
<p>Near St. Paul and Minneapolis are several points of interest–Fort
Snelling, a fortress occupying a river-bluff a hundred feet high; the
falls of Minnehaha, White-bear Lake, and so forth. The beautiful falls
of Minnehaha are sufficiently celebrated–they do not need a lift from
me, in that direction. The White-bear Lake is less known. It is a lovely
sheet of water, and is being utilized as a summer resort by the wealth
and fashion of the State. It has its club-house, and its hotel, with the
modern improvements and conveniences; its fine summer residences; and
plenty of fishing, hunting, and pleasant drives. There are a dozen minor
summer resorts around about St. Paul and Minneapolis, but the White-bear
Lake is the resort. Connected with White-bear Lake is a most idiotic
Indian legend. I would resist the temptation to print it here, if I
could, but the task is beyond my strength. The guide-book names the
preserver of the legend, and compliments his ‘facile pen.’ Without
further comment or delay then, let us turn the said facile pen loose
upon the reader–</p>
<p>A LEGEND OF WHITE-BEAR LAKE.</p>
<p>Every spring, for perhaps a century, or as long as there has been a
nation of red men, an island in the middle of White-bear Lake has been
visited by a band of Indians for the purpose of making maple sugar.</p>
<p>Tradition says that many springs ago, while upon this island, a young
warrior loved and wooed the daughter of his chief, and it is said, also,
the maiden loved the warrior. He had again and again been refused her
hand by her parents, the old chief alleging that he was no brave, and
his old consort called him a woman!</p>
<p>The sun had again set upon the ‘sugar-bush,’ and the bright moon rose
high in the bright blue heavens, when the young warrior took down his
flute and went out alone, once more to sing the story of his love, the
mild breeze gently moved the two gay feathers in his head-dress, and as
he mounted on the trunk of a leaning tree, the damp snow fell from his
feet heavily. As he raised his flute to his lips, his blanket slipped
from his well-formed shoulders, and lay partly on the snow beneath. He
began his weird, wild love-song, but soon felt that he was cold, and as
he reached back for his blanket, some unseen hand laid it gently on his
shoulders; it was the hand of his love, his guardian angel. She took her
place beside him, and for the present they were happy; for the Indian
has a heart to love, and in this pride he is as noble as in his own
freedom, which makes him the child of the forest. As the legend runs, a
large white-bear, thinking, perhaps, that polar snows and dismal winter
weather extended everywhere, took up his journey southward. He at length
approached the northern shore of the lake which now bears his name,
walked down the bank and made his way noiselessly through the deep heavy
snow toward the island. It was the same spring ensuing that the lovers
met. They had left their first retreat, and were now seated among the
branches of a large elm which hung far over the lake. (The same tree is
still standing, and excites universal curiosity and interest.) For fear
of being detected, they talked almost in a whisper, and now, that they
might get back to camp in good time and thereby avoid suspicion, they
were just rising to return, when the maiden uttered a shriek which was
heard at the camp, and bounding toward the young brave, she caught his
blanket, but missed the direction of her foot and fell, bearing the
blanket with her into the great arms of the ferocious monster. Instantly
every man, woman, and child of the band were upon the bank, but all
unarmed. Cries and wailings went up from every mouth. What was to be
done’? In the meantime this white and savage beast held the breathless
maiden in his huge grasp, and fondled with his precious prey as if he
were used to scenes like this. One deafening yell from the lover warrior
is heard above the cries of hundreds of his tribe, and dashing away to
his wigwam he grasps his faithful knife, returns almost at a single
bound to the scene of fear and fright, rushes out along the leaning tree
to the spot where his treasure fell, and springing with the fury of a
mad panther, pounced upon his prey. The animal turned, and with one
stroke of his huge paw brought the lovers heart to heart, but the next
moment the warrior, with one plunge of the blade of his knife, opened
the crimson sluices of death, and the dying bear relaxed his hold.</p>
<p>That night there was no more sleep for the band or the lovers, and as
the young and the old danced about the carcass of the dead monster, the
gallant warrior was presented with another plume, and ere another moon
had set he had a living treasure added to his heart. Their children for
many years played upon the skin of the white-bear–from which the lake
derives its name–and the maiden and the brave remembered long the
fearful scene and rescue that made them one, for Kis-se-me-pa and Ka-go-
ka could never forget their fearful encounter with the huge monster that
came so near sending them to the happy hunting-ground.</p>
<p>It is a perplexing business. First, she fell down out of the tree–she
and the blanket; and the bear caught her and fondled her–her and the
blanket; then she fell up into the tree again–leaving the blanket;
meantime the lover goes war-whooping home and comes back ‘heeled,’
climbs the tree, jumps down on the bear, the girl jumps down after him–
apparently, for she was up the tree–resumes her place in the bear’s arms
along with the blanket, the lover rams his knife into the bear, and
saves–whom, the blanket? No–nothing of the sort. You get yourself all
worked up and excited about that blanket, and then all of a sudden, just
when a happy climax seems imminent you are let down flat–nothing saved
but the girl. Whereas, one is not interested in the girl; she is not the
prominent feature of the legend. Nevertheless, there you are left, and
there you must remain; for if you live a thousand years you will never
know who got the blanket. A dead man could get up a better legend than
this one. I don’t mean a fresh dead man either; I mean a man that’s been
dead weeks and weeks.</p>
<p>We struck the home-trail now, and in a few hours were in that
astonishing Chicago–a city where they are always rubbing the lamp, and
fetching up the genii, and contriving and achieving new impossibilities.
It is hopeless for the occasional visitor to try to keep up with
Chicago–she outgrows his prophecies faster than he can make them. She is
always a novelty; for she is never the Chicago you saw when you passed
through the last time. The Pennsylvania road rushed us to New York
without missing schedule time ten minutes anywhere on the route; and
there ended one of the most enjoyable five-thousand-mile journeys I have
ever had the good fortune to make.</p>
<p>APPENDIX A</p>
<p>(FROM THE NEW ORLEANS TIMES DEMOCRAT OF MARCH 29, 1882.)</p>
<p>VOYAGE OF THE TIMES-DEMOCRAT’S RELIEF BOAT THROUGH THE INUNDATED
REGIONS</p>
<p>IT was nine o’clock Thursday morning when the ‘Susie’ left the
Mississippi and entered Old River, or what is now called the mouth of
the Red. Ascending on the left, a flood was pouring in through and over
the levees on the Chandler plantation, the most northern point in Pointe
Coupee parish. The water completely covered the place, although the
levees had given way but a short time before. The stock had been
gathered in a large flat-boat, where, without food, as we passed, the
animals were huddled together, waiting for a boat to tow them off. On
the right-hand side of the river is Turnbull’s Island, and on it is a
large plantation which formerly was pronounced one of the most fertile
in the State. The water has hitherto allowed it to go scot-free in usual
floods, but now broad sheets of water told only where fields were. The
top of the protecting levee could be seen here and there, but nearly all
of it was submerged.</p>
<p>The trees have put on a greener foliage since the water has poured
in, and the woods look bright and fresh, but this pleasant aspect to the
eye is neutralized by the interminable waste of water. We pass mile
after mile, and it is nothing but trees standing up to their branches in
water. A water-turkey now and again rises and flies ahead into the long
avenue of silence. A pirogue sometimes flits from the bushes and crosses
the Red River on its way out to the Mississippi, but the sad- faced
paddlers never turn their heads to look at our boat. The puffing of the
boat is music in this gloom, which affects one most curiously. It is not
the gloom of deep forests or dark caverns, but a peculiar kind of solemn
silence and impressive awe that holds one perforce to its recognition.
We passed two negro families on a raft tied up in the willows this
morning. They were evidently of the well-to-do class, as they had a
supply of meal and three or four hogs with them. Their rafts were about
twenty feet square, and in front of an improvised shelter earth had been
placed, on which they built their fire.</p>
<p>The current running down the Atchafalaya was very swift, the
Mississippi showing a predilection in that direction, which needs only
to be seen to enforce the opinion of that river’s desperate endeavors to
find a short way to the Gulf. Small boats, skiffs, pirogues, etc., are
in great demand, and many have been stolen by piratical negroes, who
take them where they will bring the greatest price. From what was told
me by Mr. C. P. Ferguson, a planter near Red River Landing, whose place
has just gone under, there is much suffering in the rear of that place.
The negroes had given up all thoughts of a crevasse there, as the upper
levee had stood so long, and when it did come they were at its mercy. On
Thursday a number were taken out of trees and off of cabin roofs and
brought in, many yet remaining.</p>
<p>One does not appreciate the sight of earth until he has traveled
through a flood. At sea one does not expect or look for it, but here,
with fluttering leaves, shadowy forest aisles, house-tops barely
visible, it is expected. In fact a grave-yard, if the mounds were above
water, would be appreciated. The river here is known only because there
is an opening in the trees, and that is all. It is in width, from Fort
Adams on the left bank of the Mississippi to the bank of Rapides Parish,
a distance of about sixty miles. A large portion of this was under
cultivation, particularly along the Mississippi and back of the Red.
When Red River proper was entered, a strong current was running directly
across it, pursuing the same direction as that of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>After a run of some hours, Black River was reached. Hardly was it
entered before signs of suffering became visible. All the willows along
the banks were stripped of their leaves. One man, whom your
correspondent spoke to, said that he had had one hundred and fifty head
of cattle and one hundred head of hogs. At the first appearance of water
he had started to drive them to the high lands of Avoyelles, thirty-five
miles off, but he lost fifty head of the beef cattle and sixty hogs.
Black River is quite picturesque, even if its shores are under water. A
dense growth of ash, oak, gum, and hickory make the shores almost
impenetrable, and where one can get a view down some avenue in the
trees, only the dim outlines of distant trunks can be barely
distinguished in the gloom.</p>
<p>A few miles up this river, the depth of water on the banks was fully
eight feet, and on all sides could be seen, still holding against the
strong current, the tops of cabins. Here and there one overturned was
surrounded by drift-wood, forming the nucleus of possibly some future
island.</p>
<p>In order to save coal, as it was impossible to get that fuel at any
point to be touched during the expedition, a look-out was kept for a
wood-pile. On rounding a point a pirogue, skilfully paddled by a youth,
shot out, and in its bow was a girl of fifteen, of fair face, beautiful
black eyes, and demure manners. The boy asked for a paper, which was
thrown to him, and the couple pushed their tiny craft out into the swell
of the boat.</p>
<p>Presently a little girl, not certainly over twelve years, paddled out
in the smallest little canoe and handled it with all the deftness of an
old voyageur. The little one looked more like an Indian than a white
child, and laughed when asked if she were afraid. She had been raised in
a pirogue and could go anywhere. She was bound out to pick willow leaves
for the stock, and she pointed to a house near by with water three
inches deep on the floors. At its back door was moored a raft about
thirty feet square, with a sort of fence built upon it, and inside of
this some sixteen cows and twenty hogs were standing. The family did not
complain, except on account of losing their stock, and promptly brought
a supply of wood in a flat.</p>
<p>From this point to the Mississippi River, fifteen miles, there is not
a spot of earth above water, and to the westward for thirty-five miles
there is nothing but the river’s flood. Black River had risen during
Thursday, the 23rd, 1{three-quarters} inches, and was going up at night
still. As we progress up the river habitations become more frequent, but
are yet still miles apart. Nearly all of them are deserted, and the
out-houses floated off. To add to the gloom, almost every living thing
seems to have departed, and not a whistle of a bird nor the bark of the
squirrel can be heard in this solitude. Sometimes a morose gar will
throw his tail aloft and disappear in the river, but beyond this
everything is quiet–the quiet of dissolution. Down the river floats now
a neatly whitewashed hen-house, then a cluster of neatly split fence-
rails, or a door and a bloated carcass, solemnly guarded by a pair of
buzzards, the only bird to be seen, which feast on the carcass as it
bears them along. A picture-frame in which there was a cheap lithograph
of a soldier on horseback, as it floated on told of some hearth invaded
by the water and despoiled of this ornament.</p>
<p>At dark, as it was not prudent to run, a place alongside the woods
was hunted and to a tall gum-tree the boat was made fast for the
night.</p>
<p>A pretty quarter of the moon threw a pleasant light over forest and
river, making a picture that would be a delightful piece of landscape
study, could an artist only hold it down to his canvas. The motion of
the engines had ceased, the puffing of the escaping steam was stilled,
and the enveloping silence closed upon us, and such silence it was!
Usually in a forest at night one can hear the piping of frogs, the hum
of insects, or the dropping of limbs; but here nature was dumb. The dark
recesses, those aisles into this cathedral, gave forth no sound, and
even the ripplings of the current die away.</p>
<p>At daylight Friday morning all hands were up, and up the Black we
started. The morning was a beautiful one, and the river, which is
remarkably straight, put on its loveliest garb. The blossoms of the haw
perfumed the air deliciously, and a few birds whistled blithely along
the banks. The trees were larger, and the forest seemed of older growth
than below. More fields were passed than nearer the mouth, but the same
scene presented itself–smoke-houses drifting out in the pastures, negro
quarters anchored in confusion against some oak, and the modest
residence just showing its eaves above water. The sun came up in a glory
of carmine, and the trees were brilliant in their varied shades of
green. Not a foot of soil is to be seen anywhere, and the water is
apparently growing deeper and deeper, for it reaches up to the branches
of the largest trees. All along, the bordering willows have been denuded
of leaves, showing how long the people have been at work gathering this
fodder for their animals. An old man in a pirogue was asked how the
willow leaves agreed with his cattle. He stopped in his work, and with
an ominous shake of his head replied: ‘Well, sir, it ’s enough to keep
warmth in their bodies and that’s all we expect, but it’s hard on the
hogs, particularly the small ones. They is dropping off powerful fast.
But what can you do? It ’s all we’ve got.’</p>
<p>At thirty miles above the mouth of Black River the water extends from
Natchez on the Mississippi across to the pine hills of Louisiana, a
distance of seventy-three miles, and there is hardly a spot that is not
ten feet under it. The tendency of the current up the Black is toward
the west. In fact, so much is this the case, the waters of Red River
have been driven down from toward the Calcasieu country, and the waters
of the Black enter the Red some fifteen miles above the mouth of the
former, a thing never before seen by even the oldest steamboatmen. The
water now in sight of us is entirely from the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Up to Trinity, or rather Troy, which is but a short distance below,
the people have nearly all moved out, those remaining having enough for
their present personal needs. Their cattle, though, are suffering and
dying off quite fast, as the confinement on rafts and the food they get
breeds disease.</p>
<p>After a short stop we started, and soon came to a section where there
were many open fields and cabins thickly scattered about. Here were seen
more pictures of distress. On the inside of the houses the inmates had
built on boxes a scaffold on which they placed the furniture. The bed-
posts were sawed off on top, as the ceiling was not more than four feet
from the improvised floor. The buildings looked very insecure, and
threatened every moment to float off. Near the houses were cattle
standing breast high in the water, perfectly impassive. They did not
move in their places, but stood patiently waiting for help to come. The
sight was a distressing one, and the poor creatures will be sure to die
unless speedily rescued. Cattle differ from horses in this peculiar
quality. A horse, after finding no relief comes, will swim off in search
of food, whereas a beef will stand in its tracks until with exhaustion
it drops in the water and drowns.</p>
<p>At half-past twelve o’clock a hail was given from a flat-boat inside
the line of the bank. Rounding to we ran alongside, and General York
stepped aboard. He was just then engaged in getting off stock, and
welcomed the ‘Times-Democrat’ boat heartily, as he said there was much
need for her. He said that the distress was not exaggerated in the
least. People were in a condition it was difficult even for one to
imagine. The water was so high there was great danger of their houses
being swept away. It had already risen so high that it was approaching
the eaves, and when it reaches this point there is always imminent risk
of their being swept away. If this occurs, there will be great loss of
life. The General spoke of the gallant work of many of the people in
their attempts to save their stock, but thought that fully twenty-five
per cent. had perished. Already twenty-five hundred people had received
rations from Troy, on Black River, and he had towed out a great many
cattle, but a very great quantity remained and were in dire need. The
water was now eighteen inches higher than in 1874, and there was no land
between Vidalia and the hills of Catahoula.</p>
<p>At two o’clock the ‘Susie’ reached Troy, sixty-five miles above the
mouth of Black River. Here on the left comes in Little River; just
beyond that the Ouachita, and on the right the Tensas. These three
rivers form the Black River. Troy, or a portion of it, is situated on
and around three large Indian mounds, circular in shape, which rise
above the present water about twelve feet. They are about one hundred
and fifty feet in diameter, and are about two hundred yards apart. The
houses are all built between these mounds, and hence are all flooded to
a depth of eighteen inches on their floors.</p>
<p>These elevations, built by the aborigines, hundreds of years ago, are
the only points of refuge for miles. When we arrived we found them
crowded with stock, all of which was thin and hardly able to stand up.
They were mixed together, sheep, hogs, horses, mules, and cattle. One of
these mounds has been used for many years as the grave-yard, and to-day
we saw attenuated cows lying against the marble tomb-stones, chewing
their cud in contentment, after a meal of corn furnished by General
York. Here, as below, the remarkable skill of the women and girls in the
management of the smaller pirogues was noticed. Children were paddling
about in these most ticklish crafts with all the nonchalance of
adepts.</p>
<p>General York has put into operation a perfect system in regard to
furnishing relief. He makes a personal inspection of the place where it
is asked, sees what is necessary to be done, and then, having two boats
chartered, with flats, sends them promptly to the place, when the cattle
are loaded and towed to the pine hills and uplands of Catahoula. He has
made Troy his headquarters, and to this point boats come for their
supply of feed for cattle. On the opposite side of Little River, which
branches to the left out of Black, and between it and the Ouachita, is
situated the town of Trinity, which is hourly threatened with
destruction. It is much lower than Troy, and the water is eight and nine
feet deep in the houses. A strong current sweeps through it, and it is
remarkable that all of its houses have not gone before. The residents of
both Troy and Trinity have been cared for, yet some of their stock have
to be furnished with food.</p>
<p>As soon as the ‘Susie’ reached Troy, she was turned over to General
York, and placed at his disposition to carry out the work of relief more
rapidly. Nearly all her supplies were landed on one of the mounds to
lighten her, and she was headed down stream to relieve those below. At
Tom Hooper’s place, a few miles from Troy, a large flat, with about
fifty head of stock on board, was taken in tow. The animals were fed,
and soon regained some strength. To-day we go on Little River, where the
suffering is greatest.</p>
<p>DOWN BLACK RIVER</p>
<p>Saturday Evening, March 25.</p>
<p>We started down Black River quite early, under the direction of
General York, to bring out what stock could be reached. Going down river
a flat in tow was left in a central locality, and from there men poled
her back in the rear of plantations, picking up the animals wherever
found. In the loft of a gin-house there were seventeen head found, and
after a gangway was built they were led down into the flat without
difficulty. Taking a skiff with the General, your reporter was pulled up
to a little house of two rooms, in which the water was standing two feet
on the floors. In one of the large rooms were huddled the horses and
cows of the place, while in the other the Widow Taylor and her son were
seated on a scaffold raised on the floor. One or two dug-outs were
drifting about in the roam ready to be put in service at any time. When
the flat was brought up, the side of the house was cut away as the only
means of getting the animals out, and the cattle were driven on board
the boat. General York, in this as in every case, inquired if the family
desired to leave, informing them that Major Burke, of ‘The
Times-Democrat,’ has sent the ‘Susie’ up for that purpose. Mrs. Taylor
said she thanked Major Burke, but she would try and hold out. The
remarkable tenacity of the people here to their homes is beyond all
comprehension. Just below, at a point sixteen miles from Troy,
information was received that the house of Mr. Tom Ellis was in danger,
and his family were all in it. We steamed there immediately, and a sad
picture was presented. Looking out of the half of the window left above
water, was Mrs. Ellis, who is in feeble health, whilst at the door were
her seven children, the oldest not fourteen years. One side of the house
was given up to the work animals, some twelve head, besides hogs. In the
next room the family lived, the water coming within two inches of the
bed-rail. The stove was below water, and the cooking was done on a fire
on top of it. The house threatened to give way at any moment: one end of
it was sinking, and, in fact, the building looked a mere shell. As the
boat rounded to, Mr. Ellis came out in a dug-out, and General York told
him that he had come to his relief; that ‘The Times-Democrat’ boat was
at his service, and would remove his family at once to the hills, and on
Monday a flat would take out his stock, as, until that time, they would
be busy. Notwithstanding the deplorable situation himself and family
were in, Mr. Ellis did not want to leave. He said he thought he would
wait until Monday, and take the risk of his house falling. The children
around the door looked perfectly contented, seeming to care little for
the danger they were in. These are but two instances of the many. After
weeks of privation and suffering, people still cling to their houses and
leave only when there is not room between the water and the ceiling to
build a scaffold on which to stand. It seemed to be incomprehensible,
yet the love for the old place was stronger than that for safety.</p>
<p>After leaving the Ellis place, the next spot touched at was the
Oswald place. Here the flat was towed alongside the gin-house where
there were fifteen head standing in water; and yet, as they stood on
scaffolds, their heads were above the top of the entrance. It was found
impossible to get them out without cutting away a portion of the front;
and so axes were brought into requisition and a gap made. After much
labor the horses and mules were securely placed on the flat.</p>
<p>At each place we stop there are always three, four, or more dug-outs
arriving, bringing information of stock in other places in need.
Notwithstanding the fact that a great many had driven a part of their
stock to the hills some time ago, there yet remains a large quantity,
which General York, who is working with indomitable energy, will get
landed in the pine hills by Tuesday.</p>
<p>All along Black River the ‘Susie’ has been visited by scores of
planters, whose tales are the repetition of those already heard of
suffering and loss. An old planter, who has lived on the river since
1844, said there never was such a rise, and he was satisfied more than
one quarter of the stock has been lost. Luckily the people cared first
for their work stock, and when they could find it horses and mules were
housed in a place of safety. The rise which still continues, and was two
inches last night, compels them to get them out to the hills; hence it
is that the work of General York is of such a great value. From daylight
to late at night he is going this way and that, cheering by his kindly
words and directing with calm judgment what is to be done. One
unpleasant story, of a certain merchant in New Orleans, is told all
along the river. It appears for some years past the planters have been
dealing with this individual, and many of them had balances in his
hands. When the overflow came they wrote for coffee, for meal, and, in
fact, for such little necessities as were required. No response to these
letters came, and others were written, and yet these old customers, with
plantations under water, were refused even what was necessary to sustain
life. It is needless to say he is not popular now on Back River.</p>
<p>The hills spoken of as the place of refuge for the people and stock
on Black River are in Catahoula parish, twenty-four miles from Black
River.</p>
<p>After filling the flat with cattle we took on board the family of T.
S. Hooper, seven in number, who could not longer remain in their
dwelling, and we are now taking them up Little River to the hills.</p>
<p>THE FLOOD STILL RISING</p>
<p>Troy: March 27, 1882, noon.</p>
<p>The flood here is rising about three and a half inches every
twenty-four hours, and rains have set in which will increase this.
General York feels now that our efforts ought to be directed towards
saving life, as the increase of the water has jeopardized many houses.
We intend to go up the Tensas in a few minutes, and then we will return
and go down Black River to take off families. There is a lack of steam
transportation here to meet the emergency. The General has three boats
chartered, with flats in tow, but the demand for these to tow out stock
is greater than they can meet with promptness. All are working night and
day, and the ‘Susie’ hardly stops for more than an hour anywhere. The
rise has placed Trinity in a dangerous plight, and momentarily it is
expected that some of the houses will float off. Troy is a little
higher, yet all are in the water. Reports have come in that a woman and
child have been washed away below here, and two cabins floated off.
Their occupants are the same who refused to come off day before
yesterday. One would not believe the utter passiveness of the
people.</p>
<p>As yet no news has been received of the steamer ‘Delia,’ which is
supposed to be the one sunk in yesterday’s storm on Lake Catahoula. She
is due here now, but has not arrived. Even the mail here is most
uncertain, and this I send by skiff to Natchez to get it to you. It is
impossible to get accurate data as to past crops, etc., as those who
know much about the matter have gone, and those who remain are not well
versed in the production of this section.</p>
<p>General York desires me to say that the amount of rations formerly
sent should be duplicated and sent at once. It is impossible to make any
estimate, for the people are fleeing to the hills, so rapid is the rise.
The residents here are in a state of commotion that can only be
appreciated when seen, and complete demoralization has set in,</p>
<p>If rations are drawn for any particular section hereabouts, they
would not be certain to be distributed, so everything should be sent to
Troy as a center, and the General will have it properly disposed of. He
has sent for one hundred tents, and, if all go to the hills who are in
motion now, two hundred will be required.</p>
<p>APPENDIX B</p>
<p>THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISSION</p>
<p>THE condition of this rich valley of the Lower Mississippi,
immediately after and since the war, constituted one of the disastrous
effects of war most to be deplored. Fictitious property in slaves was
not only righteously destroyed, but very much of the work which had
depended upon the slave labor was also destroyed or greatly impaired,
especially the levee system.</p>
<p>It might have been expected by those who have not investigated the
subject, that such important improvements as the construction and
maintenance of the levees would have been assumed at once by the several
States. But what can the State do where the people are under subjection
to rates of interest ranging from 18 to 30 per cent., and are also under
the necessity of pledging their crops in advance even of planting, at
these rates, for the privilege of purchasing all of their supplies at
100 per cent. profit?</p>
<p>It has needed but little attention to make it perfectly obvious that
the control of the Mississippi River, if undertaken at all, must be
undertaken by the national government, and cannot be compassed by
States. The river must be treated as a unit; its control cannot be
compassed under a divided or separate system of administration.</p>
<p>Neither are the States especially interested competent to combine
among themselves for the necessary operations. The work must begin far
up the river; at least as far as Cairo, if not beyond; and must be
conducted upon a consistent general plan throughout the course of the
river.</p>
<p>It does not need technical or scientific knowledge to comprehend the
elements of the case if one will give a little time and attention to the
subject, and when a Mississippi River commission has been constituted,
as the existing commission is, of thoroughly able men of different walks
in life, may it not be suggested that their verdict in the case should
be accepted as conclusive, so far as any a priori theory of construction
or control can be considered conclusive?</p>
<p>It should be remembered that upon this board are General Gilmore,
General Comstock, and General Suter, of the United States Engineers;
Professor Henry Mitchell (the most competent authority on the question
of hydrography), of the United States Coast Survey; B. B. Harrod, the
State Engineer of Louisiana; Jas. B. Eads, whose success with the
jetties at New Orleans is a warrant of his competency, and Judge Taylor,
of Indiana.</p>
<p>It would be presumption on the part of any single man, however
skilled, to contest the judgment of such a board as this.</p>
<p>The method of improvement proposed by the commission is at once in
accord with the results of engineering experience and with observations
of nature where meeting our wants. As in nature the growth of trees and
their proneness where undermined to fall across the slope and support
the bank secures at some points a fair depth of channel and some degree
of permanence, so in the project of the engineer the use of timber and
brush and the encouragement of forest growth are the main features. It
is proposed to reduce the width where excessive by brushwood dykes, at
first low, but raised higher and higher as the mud of the river settles
under their shelter, and finally slope them back at the angle upon which
willows will grow freely. In this work there are many details connected
with the forms of these shelter dykes, their arrangements so as to
present a series of settling basins, etc., a description of which would
only complicate the conception. Through the larger part of the river
works of contraction will not be required, but nearly all the banks on
the concave side of the beds must be held against the wear of the
stream, and much of the opposite banks defended at critical points. The
works having in view this conservative object may be generally
designated works of revetment; and these also will be largely of
brushwood, woven in continuous carpets, or twined into wire-netting.
This veneering process has been successfully employed on the Missouri
River; and in some cases they have so covered themselves with sediments,
and have become so overgrown with willows, that they may be regarded as
permanent. In securing these mats rubble-stone is to be used in small
quantities, and in some instances the dressed slope between high and low
river will have to be more or less paved with stone.</p>
<p>Any one who has been on the Rhine will have observed operations not
unlike those to which we have just referred; and, indeed, most of the
rivers of Europe flowing among their own alluvia have required similar
treatment in the interest of navigation and agriculture.</p>
<p>The levee is the crowning work of bank revetment, although not
necessarily in immediate connection. It may be set back a short distance
from the revetted bank; but it is, in effect, the requisite parapet. The
flood river and the low river cannot be brought into register, and
compelled to unite in the excavation of a single permanent channel,
without a complete control of all the stages; and even the abnormal rise
must be provided against, because this would endanger the levee, and
once in force behind the works of revetment would tear them also
away.</p>
<p>Under the general principle that the local slope of a river is the
result and measure of the resistance of its bed, it is evident that a
narrow and deep stream should have less slope, because it has less
frictional surface in proportion to capacity; i.e., less perimeter in
proportion to area of cross section. The ultimate effect of levees and
revetments confining the floods and bringing all the stages of the river
into register is to deepen the channel and let down the slope. The first
effect of the levees is to raise the surface; but this, by inducing
greater velocity of flow, inevitably causes an enlargement of section,
and if this enlargement is prevented from being made at the expense of
the banks, the bottom must give way and the form of the waterway be so
improved as to admit this flow with less rise. The actual experience
with levees upon the Mississippi River, with no attempt to hold the
banks, has been favorable, and no one can doubt, upon the evidence
furnished in the reports of the commission, that if the earliest levees
had been accompanied by revetment of banks, and made complete, we should
have to-day a river navigable at low water, and an adjacent country safe
from inundation.</p>
<p>Of course it would be illogical to conclude that the constrained
river can ever lower its flood slope so as to make levees unnecessary,
but it is believed that, by this lateral constraint, the river as a
conduit may be so improved in form that even those rare floods which
result from the coincident rising of many tributaries will find vent
without destroying levees of ordinary height. That the actual capacity
of a channel through alluvium depends upon its service during floods has
been often shown, but this capacity does not include anomalous, but
recurrent, floods.</p>
<p>It is hardly worth while to consider the projects for relieving the
Mississippi River floods by creating new outlets, since these
sensational propositions have commended themselves only to unthinking
minds, and have no support among engineers. Were the river bed cast-
iron, a resort to openings for surplus waters might be a necessity; but
as the bottom is yielding, and the best form of outlet is a single deep
channel, as realizing the least ratio of perimeter to area of cross
section, there could not well be a more unphilosophical method of
treatment than the multiplication of avenues of escape.</p>
<p>In the foregoing statement the attempt has been made to condense in
as limited a space as the importance of the subject would permit, the
general elements of the problem, and the general features of the
proposed method of improvement which has been adopted by the Mississippi
River Commission.</p>
<p>The writer cannot help feeling that it is somewhat presumptuous on
his part to attempt to present the facts relating to an enterprise which
calls for the highest scientific skill; but it is a matter which
interests every citizen of the United States, and is one of the methods
of reconstruction which ought to be approved. It is a war claim which
implies no private gain, and no compensation except for one of the cases
of destruction incident to war, which may well be repaired by the people
of the whole country.</p>
<p>EDWARD ATKINSON.</p>
<p>Boston: April 14, 1882.</p>
<p>APPENDIX C</p>
<p>RECEPTION OF CAPTAIN BASIL HALL’S BOOK IN THE UNITED STATES</p>
<p>HAVING now arrived nearly at the end of our travels, I am induced,
ere I conclude, again to mention what I consider as one of the most
remarkable traits in the national character of the Americans; namely,
their exquisite sensitiveness and soreness respecting everything said or
written concerning them. Of this, perhaps, the most remarkable example I
can give is the effect produced on nearly every class of readers by the
appearance of Captain Basil Hall’s ‘Travels in North America.’ In fact,
it was a sort of moral earthquake, and the vibration it occasioned
through the nerves of the republic, from one corner of the Union to the
other, was by no means over when I left the country in July 1831, a
couple of years after the shock.</p>
<p>I was in Cincinnati when these volumes came out, but it was not till
July 1830, that I procured a copy of them. One bookseller to whom I
applied told me that he had had a few copies before he understood the
nature of the work, but that, after becoming acquainted with it, nothing
should induce him to sell another. Other persons of his profession must,
however, have been less scrupulous; for the book was read in city, town,
village, and hamlet, steamboat, and stage-coach, and a sort of war-whoop
was sent forth perfectly unprecedented in my recollection upon any
occasion whatever.</p>
<p>An ardent desire for approbation, and a delicate sensitiveness under
censure, have always, I believe, been considered as amiable traits of
character; but the condition into which the appearance of Captain Hall’s
work threw the republic shows plainly that these feelings, if carried to
excess, produce a weakness which amounts to imbecility.</p>
<p>It was perfectly astonishing to hear men who, on other subjects, were
of some judgment, utter their opinions upon this. I never heard of any
instance in which the commonsense generally found in national criticism
was so overthrown by passion. I do not speak of the want of justice, and
of fair and liberal interpretation: these, perhaps, were hardly to be
expected. Other nations have been called thin-skinned, but the citizens
of the Union have, apparently, no skins at all; they wince if a breeze
blows over them, unless it be tempered with adulation. It was not,
therefore, very surprising that the acute and forcible observations of a
traveler they knew would be listened to should be received testily. The
extraordinary features of the business were, first, the excess of the
rage into which they lashed themselves; and, secondly, the puerility of
the inventions by which they attempted to account for the severity with
which they fancied they had been treated.</p>
<p>Not content with declaring that the volumes contained no word of
truth, from beginning to end (which is an assertion I heard made very
nearly as often as they were mentioned), the whole country set to work
to discover the causes why Captain Hall had visited the United States,
and why he had published his book.</p>
<p>I have heard it said with as much precision and gravity as if the
statement had been conveyed by an official report, that Captain Hall had
been sent out by the British Government expressly for the purpose of
checking the growing admiration of England for the Government of the
United States,–that it was by a commission from the treasury he had
come, and that it was only in obedience to orders that he had found
anything to object to.</p>
<p>I do not give this as the gossip of a coterie; I am persuaded that it
is the belief of a very considerable portion of the country. So deep is
the conviction of this singular people that they cannot be seen without
being admired, that they will not admit the possibility that any one
should honestly and sincerely find aught to disapprove in them or their
country.</p>
<p>The American Reviews are, many of them, I believe, well known in
England; I need not, therefore, quote them here, but I sometimes
wondered that they, none of them, ever thought of translating Obadiah’s
curse into classic American; if they had done so, on placing (he, Basil
Hall) between brackets, instead of (he, Obadiah) it would have saved
them a world of trouble.</p>
<p>I can hardly describe the curiosity with which I sat down at length
to peruse these tremendous volumes; still less can I do justice to my
surprise at their contents. To say that I found not one exaggerated
statement throughout the work is by no means saying enough. It is
impossible for any one who knows the country not to see that Captain
Hall earnestly sought out things to admire and commend. When he praises,
it is with evident pleasure; and when he finds fault, it is with evident
reluctance and restraint, excepting where motives purely patriotic urge
him to state roundly what it is for the benefit of his country should be
known.</p>
<p>In fact, Captain Hall saw the country to the greatest possible
advantage. Furnished, of course, with letters of introduction to the
most distinguished individuals, and with the still more influential
recommendation of his own reputation, he was received in full drawing-
room style and state from one end of the Union to the other. He saw the
country in full dress, and had little or no opportunity of judging of it
unhouselled, unanointed, unannealed, with all its imperfections on its
head, as I and my family too often had.</p>
<p>Captain Hall had certainly excellent opportunities of making himself
acquainted with the form of the government and the laws; and of
receiving, moreover, the best oral commentary upon them, in conversation
with the most distinguished citizens. Of these opportunities he made
excellent use; nothing important met his eye which did not receive that
sort of analytical attention which an experienced and philosophical
traveler alone can give. This has made his volumes highly interesting
and valuable; but I am deeply persuaded, that were a man of equal
penetration to visit the United States with no other means of becoming
acquainted with the national character than the ordinary working-day
intercourse of life, he would conceive an infinitely lower idea of the
moral atmosphere of the country than Captain Hall appears to have done;
and the internal conviction on my mind is strong, that if Captain Hall
had not placed a firm restraint on himself, he must have given
expression to far deeper indignation than any he has uttered against
many points in the American character, with which he shows from other
circumstances that he was well acquainted. His rule appears to have been
to state just so much of the truth as would leave on the mind of his
readers a correct impression, at the least cost of pain to the sensitive
folks he was writing about. He states his own opinions and feelings, and
leaves it to be inferred that he has good grounds for adopting them; but
he spares the Americans the bitterness which a detail of the
circumstances would have produced.</p>
<p>If any one chooses to say that some wicked antipathy to twelve
millions of strangers is the origin of my opinion, I must bear it; and
were the question one of mere idle speculation, I certainly would not
court the abuse I must meet for stating it. But it is not so.</p>
<p>. . . . . . .</p>
<p>The candor which he expresses, and evidently feels, they mistake for
irony, or totally distrust; his unwillingness to give pain to persons
from whom he has received kindness, they scornfully reject as
affectation, and although they must know right well, in their own secret
hearts, how infinitely more they lay at his mercy than he has chosen to
betray; they pretend, even to themselves, that he has exaggerated the
bad points of their character and institutions; whereas, the truth is,
that he has let them off with a degree of tenderness which may be quite
suitable for him to exercise, however little merited; while, at the same
time, he has most industriously magnified their merits, whenever he
could possibly find anything favorable.</p>
<p>APPENDIX D</p>
<p>THE UNDYING HEAD</p>
<p>IN a remote part of the North lived a man and his sister, who had
never seen a human being. Seldom, if ever, had the man any cause to go
from home; for, as his wants demanded food, he had only to go a little
distance from the lodge, and there, in some particular spot, place his
arrows, with their barbs in the ground. Telling his sister where they
had been placed, every morning she would go in search, and never fail of
finding each stuck through the heart of a deer. She had then only to
drag them into the lodge and prepare their food. Thus she lived till she
attained womanhood, when one day her brother, whose name was Iamo, said
to her: ‘Sister, the time is at hand when you will be ill. Listen to my
advice. If you do not, it will probably be the cause of my death. Take
the implements with which we kindle our fires. Go some distance from our
lodge and build a separate fire. When you are in want of food, I will
tell you where to find it. You must cook for yourself, and I will for
myself. When you are ill, do not attempt to come near the lodge, or
bring any of the utensils you use. Be sure always to fasten to your belt
the implements you need, for you do not know when the time will come. As
for myself, I must do the best I can.’ His sister promised to obey him
in all he had said.</p>
<p>Shortly after, her brother had cause to go from home. She was alone
in her lodge, combing her hair. She had just untied the belt to which
the implements were fastened, when suddenly the event, to which her
brother had alluded, occurred. She ran out of the lodge, but in her
haste forgot the belt. Afraid to return, she stood for some time
thinking. Finally, she decided to enter the lodge and get it. For,
thought she, my brother is not at home, and I will stay but a moment to
catch hold of it. She went back. Running in suddenly, she caught hold of
it, and was coming out when her brother came in sight. He knew what was
the matter. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘did I not tell you to take care. But now you
have killed me.’ She was going on her way, but her brother said to her,
‘What can you do there now. The accident has happened. Go in, and stay
where you have always stayed. And what will become of you? You have
killed me.’</p>
<p>He then laid aside his hunting-dress and accoutrements, and soon
after both his feet began to turn black, so that he could not move.
Still he directed his sister where to place the arrows, that she might
always have food. The inflammation continued to increase, and had now
reached his first rib; and he said: ‘Sister, my end is near. You must do
as I tell you. You see my medicine-sack, and my war-club tied to it. It
contains all my medicines, and my war-plumes, and my paints of all
colors. As soon as the inflammation reaches my breast, you will take my
war-club. It has a sharp point, and you will cut off my head. When it is
free from my body, take it, place its neck in the sack, which you must
open at one end. Then hang it up in its former place. Do not forget my
bow and arrows. One of the last you will take to procure food. The
remainder, tie in my sack, and then hang it up, so that I can look
towards the door. Now and then I will speak to you, but not often.’ His
sister again promised to obey.</p>
<p>In a little time his breast was affected. ‘Now,’ said he, ‘take the
club and strike off my head.’ She was afraid, but he told her to muster
courage. ‘Strike,’ said he, and a smile was on his face. Mustering all
her courage, she gave the blow and cut off the head. ‘Now,’ said the
head, ‘place me where I told you.’ And fearfully she obeyed it in all
its commands. Retaining its animation, it looked around the lodge as
usual, and it would command its sister to go in such places as it
thought would procure for her the flesh of different animals she needed.
One day the head said: ‘The time is not distant when I shall be freed
from this situation, and I shall have to undergo many sore evils. So the
superior manito decrees, and I must bear all patiently.’ In this
situation we must leave the head.</p>
<p>In a certain part of the country was a village inhabited by a
numerous and warlike band of Indians. In this village was a family of
ten young men–brothers. It was in the spring of the year that the
youngest of these blackened his face and fasted. His dreams were
propitious. Having ended his fast, he went secretly for his brothers at
night, so that none in the village could overhear or find out the
direction they intended to go. Though their drum was heard, yet that was
a common occurrence. Having ended the usual formalities, he told how
favorable his dreams were, and that he had called them together to know
if they would accompany him in a war excursion. They all answered they
would. The third brother from the eldest, noted for his oddities, coming
up with his war-club when his brother had ceased speaking, jumped up.
‘Yes,’ said he, ‘I will go, and this will be the way I will treat those
I am going to fight;’ and he struck the post in the center of the lodge,
and gave a yell. The others spoke to him, saying: ‘Slow, slow,
Mudjikewis, when you are in other people’s lodges.’ So he sat down.
Then, in turn, they took the drum, and sang their songs, and closed with
a feast. The youngest told them not to whisper their intention to their
wives, but secretly to prepare for their journey. They all promised
obedience, and Mudjikewis was the first to say so.</p>
<p>The time for their departure drew near. Word was given to assemble on
a certain night, when they would depart immediately. Mudjikewis was loud
in his demands for his moccasins. Several times his wife asked him the
reason. ‘Besides,’ said she, ‘you have a good pair on.’ ‘Quick, quick,’
said he, ‘since you must know, we are going on a war excursion; so be
quick.’ He thus revealed the secret. That night they met and started.
The snow was on the ground, and they traveled all night, lest others
should follow them. When it was daylight, the leader took snow and made
a ball of it, then tossing it into the air, he said: ‘It was in this way
I saw snow fall in a dream, so that I could not be tracked.’ And he told
them to keep close to each other for fear of losing themselves, as the
snow began to fall in very large flakes. Near as they walked, it was
with difficulty they could see each other. The snow continued falling
all that day and the following night, so it was impossible to track
them.</p>
<p>They had now walked for several days, and Mudjikewis was always in
the rear. One day, running suddenly forward, he gave the SAW-SAW-
QUAN,{footnote [War-whoop.]} and struck a tree with his war-club, and it
broke into pieces as if struck with lightning. ‘Brothers,’ said he,
‘this will be the way I will serve those we are going to fight.’ The
leader answered, ‘Slow, slow, Mudjikewis, the one I lead you to is not
to be thought of so lightly.’ Again he fell back and thought to himself:
‘What! what! who can this be he is leading us to?’ He felt fearful and
was silent. Day after day they traveled on, till they came to an
extensive plain, on the borders of which human bones were bleaching in
the sun. The leader spoke: ‘They are the bones of those who have gone
before us. None has ever yet returned to tell the sad tale of their
fate.’ Again Mudjikewis became restless, and, running forward, gave the
accustomed yell. Advancing to a large rock which stood above the ground,
he struck it, and it fell to pieces. ‘See, brothers,’ said he, ‘thus
will I treat those whom we are going to fight.’ ‘Still, still,’ once
more said the leader; ‘he to whom I am leading you is not to be compared
to the rock.’</p>
<p>Mudjikewis fell back thoughtful, saying to himself: ‘I wonder who
this can be that he is going to attack;’ and he was afraid. Still they
continued to see the remains of former warriors, who had been to the
place where they were now going, some of whom had retreated as far back
as the place where they first saw the bones, beyond which no one had
ever escaped. At last they came to a piece of rising ground, from which
they plainly distinguished, sleeping on a distant mountain, a mammoth
bear.</p>
<p>The distance between them was very great, but the size of the animal
caused him to be plainly seen. ‘There,’ said the leader, ‘it is he to
whom I am leading you; here our troubles will commence, for he is a
mishemokwa and a manito. It is he who has that we prize so dearly
(i.e. wampum), to obtain which, the warriors whose bones we saw,
sacrificed their lives. You must not be fearful: be manly. We shall find
him asleep.’ Then the leader went forward and touched the belt around
the animal’s neck. ‘This,’ said he, ‘is what we must get. It contains
the wampum.’ Then they requested the eldest to try and slip the belt
over the bear’s head, who appeared to be fast asleep, as he was not in
the least disturbed by the attempt to obtain the belt. All their efforts
were in vain, till it came to the one next the youngest. He tried, and
the belt moved nearly over the monster’s head, but he could get it no
farther. Then the youngest one, and the leader, made his attempt, and
succeeded. Placing it on the back of the oldest, he said, ‘Now we must
run,’ and off they started. When one became fatigued with its weight,
another would relieve him. Thus they ran till they had passed the bones
of all former warriors, and were some distance beyond, when looking
back, they saw the monster slowly rising. He stood some time before he
missed his wampum. Soon they heard his tremendous howl, like distant
thunder, slowly filling all the sky; and then they heard him speak and
say, ‘Who can it be that has dared to steal my wampum? earth is not so
large but that I can find them;’ and he descended from the hill in
pursuit. As if convulsed, the earth shook with every jump he made. Very
soon he approached the party. They, however, kept the belt, exchanging
it from one to another, and encouraging each other; but he gained on
them fast. ‘Brothers,’ said the leader, ‘has never any one of you, when
fasting, dreamed of some friendly spirit who would aid you as a
guardian?’ A dead silence followed. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘fasting, I dreamed
of being in danger of instant death, when I saw a small lodge, with
smoke curling from its top. An old man lived in it, and I dreamed he
helped me; and may it be verified soon,’ he said, running forward and
giving the peculiar yell, and a howl as if the sounds came from the
depths of his stomach, and what is called CHECAUDUM. Getting upon a
piece of rising ground, behold! a lodge, with smoke curling from its
top, appeared. This gave them all new strength, and they ran forward and
entered it. The leader spoke to the old man who sat in the lodge,
saying, ‘Nemesho, help us; we claim your protection, for the great bear
will kill us.’ ‘Sit down and eat, my grandchildren,’ said the old man.
‘Who is a great manito?’ said he. ‘There is none but me; but let me
look,’ and he opened the door of the lodge, when, lo! at a little
distance he saw the enraged animal coming on, with slow but powerful
leaps. He closed the door. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘he is indeed a great manito:
my grandchildren, you will be the cause of my losing my life; you asked
my protection, and I granted it; so now, come what may, I will protect
you. When the bear arrives at the door, you must run out of the other
door of the lodge.’ Then putting his hand to the side of the lodge where
he sat, he brought out a bag which he opened. Taking out two small black
dogs, he placed them before him. ‘These are the ones I use when I
fight,’ said he; and he commenced patting with both hands the sides of
one of them, and he began to swell out, so that he soon filled the lodge
by his bulk; and he had great strong teeth. When he attained his full
size he growled, and from that moment, as from instinct, he jumped out
at the door and met the bear, who in another leap would have reached the
lodge. A terrible combat ensued. The skies rang with the howls of the
fierce monsters. The remaining dog soon took the field. The brothers, at
the onset, took the advice of the old man, and escaped through the
opposite side of the lodge. They had not proceeded far before they heard
the dying cry of one of the dogs, and soon after of the other. ‘Well,’
said the leader, ‘the old man will share their fate: so run; he will
soon be after us.’ They started with fresh vigor, for they had received
food from the old man: but very soon the bear came in sight, and again
was fast gaining upon them. Again the leader asked the brothers if they
could do nothing for their safety. All were silent. The leader, running
forward, did as before. ‘I dreamed,’ he cried, ‘that, being in great
trouble, an old man helped me who was a manito; we shall soon see his
lodge.’ Taking courage, they still went on. After going a short distance
they saw the lodge of the old manito. They entered immediately and
claimed his protection, telling him a manito was after them. The old
man, setting meat before them, said: ‘Eat! who is a manito? there is no
manito but me; there is none whom I fear;’ and the earth trembled as the
monster advanced. The old man opened the door and saw him coming. He
shut it slowly, and said: ‘Yes, my grandchildren, you have brought
trouble upon me.’ Procuring his medicine-sack, he took out his small
war-clubs of black stone, and told the young men to run through the
other side of the lodge. As he handled the clubs, they became very
large, and the old man stepped out just as the bear reached the door.
Then striking him with one of the clubs, it broke in pieces; the bear
stumbled. Renewing the attempt with the other war-club, that also was
broken, but the bear fell senseless. Each blow the old man gave him
sounded like a clap of thunder, and the howls of the bear ran along till
they filled the heavens.</p>
<p>The young men had now run some distance, when they looked back. They
could see that the bear was recovering from the blows. First he moved
his paws, and soon they saw him rise on his feet. The old man shared the
fate of the first, for they now heard his cries as he was torn in
pieces. Again the monster was in pursuit, and fast overtaking them. Not
yet discouraged, the young men kept on their way; but the bear was now
so close, that the leader once more applied to his brothers, but they
could do nothing. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘my dreams will soon be exhausted;
after this I have but one more.’ He advanced, invoking his guardian
spirit to aid him. ‘Once,’ said he, ‘I dreamed that, being sorely
pressed, I came to a large lake, on the shore of which was a canoe,
partly out of water, having ten paddles all in readiness. Do not fear,’
he cried, ‘we shall soon get it.’ And so it was, even as he had said.
Coming to the lake, they saw the canoe with ten paddles, and immediately
they embarked. Scarcely had they reached the center of the lake, when
they saw the bear arrive at its borders. Lifting himself on his hind
legs, he looked all around. Then he waded into the water; then losing
his footing he turned back, and commenced making the circuit of the
lake. Meantime the party remained stationary in the center to watch his
movements. He traveled all around, till at last he came to the place
from whence he started. Then he commenced drinking up the water, and
they saw the current fast setting in towards his open mouth. The leader
encouraged them to paddle hard for the opposite shore. When only a short
distance from land, the current had increased so much, that they were
drawn back by it, and all their efforts to reach it were in vain.</p>
<p>Then the leader again spoke, telling them to meet their fates
manfully. ‘Now is the time, Mudjikewis,’ said he, ‘to show your prowess.
Take courage and sit at the bow of the canoe; and when it approaches his
mouth, try what effect your club will have on his head.’ He obeyed, and
stood ready to give the blow; while the leader, who steered, directed
the canoe for the open mouth of the monster.</p>
<p>Rapidly advancing, they were just about to enter his mouth, when
Mudjikewis struck him a tremendous blow on the head, and gave the SAW-
SAW-QUAN. The bear’s limbs doubled under him, and he fell, stunned by
the blow. But before Mudjikewis could renew it, the monster disgorged
all the water he had drank, with a force which sent the canoe with great
velocity to the opposite shore. Instantly leaving the canoe, again they
fled, and on they went till they were completely exhausted. The earth
again shook, and soon they saw the monster hard after them. Their
spirits drooped, and they felt discouraged. The leader exerted himself,
by actions and words, to cheer them up; and once more he asked them if
they thought of nothing, or could do nothing for their rescue; and, as
before, all were silent. ‘Then,’ he said, ‘this is the last time I can
apply to my guardian spirit. Now, if we do not succeed, our fates are
decided.’ He ran forward, invoking his spirit with great earnestness,
and gave the yell. ‘We shall soon arrive,’ said he to his brothers, ‘at
the place where my last guardian spirit dwells. In him I place great
confidence. Do not, do not be afraid, or your limbs will be fear-bound.
We shall soon reach his lodge. Run, run,’ he cried.</p>
<p>Returning now to Iamo, he had passed all the time in the same
condition we had left him, the head directing his sister, in order to
procure food, where to place the magic arrows, and speaking at long
intervals. One day the sister saw the eyes of the head brighten, as if
with pleasure. At last it spoke. ‘Oh, sister,’ it said, ‘in what a
pitiful situation you have been the cause of placing me! Soon, very
soon, a party of young men will arrive and apply to me for aid; but
alas! How can I give what I would have done with so much pleasure?
Nevertheless, take two arrows, and place them where you have been in the
habit of placing the others, and have meat prepared and cooked before
they arrive. When you hear them coming and calling on my name, go out
and say, “Alas! it is long ago that an accident befell him. I was the
cause of it.“ If they still come near, ask them in, and set meat before
them. And now you must follow my directions strictly. When the bear is
near, go out and meet him. You will take my medicine-sack, bows and
arrows, and my head. You must then untie the sack, and spread out before
you my paints of all colors, my war-eagle feathers, my tufts of dried
hair, and whatever else it contains. As the bear approaches, you will
take all these articles, one by one, and say to him, “This is my
deceased brother’s paint,“ and so on with all the other articles,
throwing each of them as far as you can. The virtues contained in them
will cause him to totter; and, to complete his destruction, you will
take my head, and that too you will cast as far off as you can, crying
aloud, “See, this is my deceased brother’s head.“ He will then fall
senseless. By this time the young men will have eaten, and you will call
them to your assistance. You must then cut the carcass into pieces, yes,
into small pieces, and scatter them to the four winds; for, unless you
do this, he will again revive.’ She promised that all should be done as
he said. She had only time to prepare the meat, when the voice of the
leader was heard calling upon Iamo for aid. The woman went out and said
as her brother had directed. But the war party being closely pursued,
came up to the lodge. She invited them in, and placed the meat before
them. While they were eating, they heard the bear approaching. Untying
the medicine-sack and taking the head, she had all in readiness for his
approach. When he came up she did as she had been told; and, before she
had expended the paints and feathers, the bear began to totter, but,
still advancing, came close to the woman. Saying as she was commanded,
she then took the head, and cast it as far from her as she could. As it
rolled along the ground, the blood, excited by the feelings of the head
in this terrible scene, gushed from the nose and mouth. The bear,
tottering, soon fell with a tremendous noise. Then she cried for help,
and the young men came rushing out, having partially regained their
strength and spirits.</p>
<p>Mudjikewis, stepping up, gave a yell and struck him a blow upon the
head. This he repeated, till it seemed like a mass of brains, while the
others, as quick as possible, cut him into very small pieces, which they
then scattered in every direction. While thus employed, happening to
look around where they had thrown the meat, wonderful to behold, they
saw starting up and turning off in every direction small black bears,
such as are seen at the present day. The country was soon overspread
with these black animals. And it was from this monster that the present
race of bears derived their origin.</p>
<p>Having thus overcome their pursuer, they returned to the lodge. In
the meantime, the woman, gathering the implements she had used, and the
head, placed them again in the sack. But the head did not speak again,
probably from its great exertion to overcome the monster.</p>
<p>Having spent so much time and traversed so vast a country in their
flight, the young men gave up the idea of ever returning to their own
country, and game being plenty, they determined to remain where they now
were. One day they moved off some distance from the lodge for the
purpose of hunting, having left the wampum with the woman. They were
very successful, and amused themselves, as all young men do when alone,
by talking and jesting with each other. One of them spoke and said, ‘We
have all this sport to ourselves; let us go and ask our sister if she
will not let us bring the head to this place, as it is still alive. It
may be pleased to hear us talk, and be in our company. In the meantime
take food to our sister.’ They went and requested the head. She told
them to take it, and they took it to their hunting-grounds, and tried to
amuse it, but only at times did they see its eyes beam with pleasure.
One day, while busy in their encampment, they were unexpectedly attacked
by unknown Indians. The skirmish was long contested and bloody; many of
their foes were slain, but still they were thirty to one. The young men
fought desperately till they were all killed. The attacking party then
retreated to a height of ground, to muster their men, and to count the
number of missing and slain. One of their young men had stayed away,
and, in endeavoring to overtake them, came to the place where the head
was hung up. Seeing that alone retain animation, he eyed it for some
time with fear and surprise. However, he took it down and opened the
sack, and was much pleased to see the beautiful feathers, one of which
he placed on his head.</p>
<p>Starting off, it waved gracefully over him till he reached his party,
when he threw down the head and sack, and told them how he had found it,
and that the sack was full of paints and feathers. They all looked at
the head and made sport of it. Numbers of the young men took the paint
and painted themselves, and one of the party took the head by the hair
and said–</p>
<p>‘Look, you ugly thing, and see your paints on the faces of
warriors.’</p>
<p>But the feathers were so beautiful, that numbers of them also placed
them on their heads. Then again they used all kinds of indignity to the
head, for which they were in turn repaid by the death of those who had
used the feathers. Then the chief commanded them to throw away all
except the head. ‘We will see,’ said he, ‘when we get home, what we can
do with it. We will try to make it shut its eyes.’</p>
<p>When they reached their homes they took it to the council-lodge, and
hung it up before the fire, fastening it with raw hide soaked, which
would shrink and become tightened by the action of the fire. ‘We will
then see,’ they said, ‘if we cannot make it shut its eyes.’</p>
<p>Meantime, for several days, the sister had been waiting for the young
men to bring back the head; till, at last, getting impatient, she went
in search of it. The young men she found lying within short distances of
each other, dead, and covered with wounds. Various other bodies lay
scattered in different directions around them. She searched for the head
and sack, but they were nowhere to be found. She raised her voice and
wept, and blackened her face. Then she walked in different directions,
till she came to the place from whence the head had been taken. Then she
found the magic bow and arrows, where the young men, ignorant of their
qualities, had left them. She thought to herself that she would find her
brother’s head, and came to a piece of rising ground, and there saw some
of his paints and feathers. These she carefully put up, and hung upon
the branch of a tree till her return.</p>
<p>At dusk she arrived at the first lodge of a very extensive village.
Here she used a charm, common among Indians when they wish to meet with
a kind reception. On applying to the old man and woman of the lodge, she
was kindly received. She made known her errand. The old man promised to
aid her, and told her the head was hung up before the council-fire, and
that the chiefs of the village, with their young men, kept watch over it
continually. The former are considered as manitoes. She said she only
wished to see it, and would be satisfied if she could only get to the
door of the lodge. She knew she had not sufficient power to take it by
force. ‘Come with me,’ said the Indian, ‘I will take you there.’ They
went, and they took their seats near the door. The council-lodge was
filled with warriors, amusing themselves with games, and constantly
keeping up a fire to smoke the head, as they said, to make dry meat.
They saw the head move, and not knowing what to make of it, one spoke
and said: ‘Ha! ha! It is beginning to feel the effects of the smoke.’
The sister looked up from the door, and her eyes met those of her
brother, and tears rolled down the cheeks of the head. ‘Well,’ said the
chief, ‘I thought we would make you do something at last. Look! look at
it–shedding tears,’ said he to those around him; and they all laughed
and passed their jokes upon it. The chief, looking around, and observing
the woman, after some time said to the man who came with her: ‘Who have
you got there? I have never seen that woman before in our village.’
‘Yes,’ replied the man, ‘you have seen her; she is a relation of mine,
and seldom goes out. She stays at my lodge, and asked me to allow her to
come with me to this place.’ In the center of the lodge sat one of those
young men who are always forward, and fond of boasting and displaying
themselves before others. ‘Why,’ said he, ‘I have seen her often, and it
is to this lodge I go almost every night to court her.’ All the others
laughed and continued their games. The young man did not know he was
telling a lie to the woman’s advantage, who by that means escaped.</p>
<p>She returned to the man’s lodge, and immediately set out for her own
country. Coming to the spot where the bodies of her adopted brothers
lay, she placed them together, their feet toward the east. Then taking
an ax which she had, she cast it up into the air, crying out, ‘Brothers,
get up from under it, or it will fall on you.’ This she repeated three
times, and the third time the brothers all arose and stood on their
feet.</p>
<p>Mudjikewis commenced rubbing his eyes and stretching himself. ‘Why,’
said he, ‘I have overslept myself.’ ‘No, indeed,’ said one of the
others, ‘do you not know we were all killed, and that it is our sister
who has brought us to life?’ The young men took the bodies of their
enemies and burned them. Soon after, the woman went to procure wives for
them, in a distant country, they knew not where; but she returned with
ten young women, which she gave to the ten young men, beginning with the
eldest. Mudjikewis stepped to and fro, uneasy lest he should not get the
one he liked. But he was not disappointed, for she fell to his lot. And
they were well matched, for she was a female magician. They then all
moved into a very large lodge, and their sister told them that the women
must now take turns in going to her brother’s head every night, trying
to untie it. They all said they would do so with pleasure. The eldest
made the first attempt, and with a rushing noise she fled through the
air.</p>
<p>Toward daylight she returned. She had been unsuccessful, as she
succeeded in untying only one of the knots. All took their turns
regularly, and each one succeeded in untying only one knot each time.
But when the youngest went, she commenced the work as soon as she
reached the lodge; although it had always been occupied, still the
Indians never could see any one. For ten nights now, the smoke had not
ascended, but filled the lodge and drove them out. This last night they
were all driven out, and the young woman carried off the head.</p>
<p>The young people and the sister heard the young woman coming high
through the air, and they heard her saying: ‘Prepare the body of our
brother.’ And as soon as they heard it, they went to a small lodge where
the black body of Iamo lay. His sister commenced cutting the neck part,
from which the neck had been severed. She cut so deep as to cause it to
bleed; and the others who were present, by rubbing the body and applying
medicines, expelled the blackness. In the meantime, the one who brought
it, by cutting the neck of the head, caused that also to bleed.</p>
<p>As soon as she arrived, they placed that close to the body, and, by
aid of medicines and various other means, succeeded in restoring Iamo to
all his former beauty and manliness. All rejoiced in the happy
termination of their troubles, and they had spent some time joyfully
together, when Iamo said: ‘Now I will divide the wampum,’ and getting
the belt which contained it, he commenced with the eldest, giving it in
equal portions. But the youngest got the most splendid and beautiful, as
the bottom of the belt held the richest and rarest.</p>
<p>They were told that, since they had all once died, and were restored
to life, they were no longer mortal, but spirits, and they were assigned
different stations in the invisible world. Only Mudjikewis’s place was,
however, named. He was to direct the west wind, hence generally called
Kebeyun, there to remain for ever. They were commanded, as they had it
in their power, to do good to the inhabitants of the earth, and,
forgetting their sufferings in procuring the wampum, to give all things
with a liberal hand. And they were also commanded that it should also be
held by them sacred; those grains or shells of the pale hue to be
emblematic of peace, while those of the darker hue would lead to evil
and war.</p>
<p>The spirits then, amid songs and shouts, took their flight to their
respective abodes on high; while Iamo, with his sister Iamoqua,
descended into the depths below.</p>

<p>IN this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: the Missouri
