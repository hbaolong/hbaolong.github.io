<h4 id="my-first-literary-venture">MY FIRST LITERARY VENTURE</h4>
<p>I was a very smart child at the age of thirteen–an unusually smart
child, I thought at the time. It was then that I did my first newspaper
scribbling, and most unexpectedly to me it stirred up a fine sensation
in the community. It did, indeed, and I was very proud of it, too. I was
a printer’s “devil,“ and a progressive and aspiring one. My uncle had me
on his paper (the Weekly Hannibal journal, two dollars a year in advance
–five hundred subscribers, and they paid in cordwood, cabbages, and
unmarketable turnips), and on a lucky summer’s day he left town to be
gone a week, and asked me if I thought I could edit one issue of the
paper judiciously. Ah! didn’t I want to try! Higgins was the editor on
the rival paper. He had lately been jilted, and one night a friend found
an open note on the poor fellow’s bed, in which he stated that he could
not longer endure life and had drowned himself in Bear Creek. The friend
ran down there and discovered Higgins wading back to shore. He had
concluded he wouldn’t. The village was full of it for several days, but
Higgins did not suspect it. I thought this was a fine opportunity. I
wrote an elaborately wretched account of the whole matter, and then
illustrated it with villainous cuts engraved on the bottoms of wooden
type with a jackknife–one of them a picture of Higgins wading out into
the creek in his shirt, with a lantern, sounding the depth of the water
with a walking-stick. I thought it was desperately funny, and was
densely unconscious that there was any moral obliquity about such a
publication. Being satisfied with this effort I looked around for other
worlds to conquer, and it struck me that it would make good, interesting
matter to charge the editor of a neighboring country paper with a piece
of gratuitous rascality and “see him squirm.“</p>
<p>I did it, putting the article into the form of a parody on the
“Burial of Sir John Moore“–and a pretty crude parody it was, too.</p>
<p>Then I lampooned two prominent citizens outrageously–not because they
had done anything to deserve, but merely because I thought it was my
duty to make the paper lively.</p>
<p>Next I gently touched up the newest stranger–the lion of the day, the
gorgeous journeyman tailor from Quincy. He was a simpering coxcomb of
the first water, and the “loudest“ dressed man in the state. He was an
inveterate woman-killer. Every week he wrote lushy “poetry“ for the
journal, about his newest conquest. His rhymes for my week were headed,
“To MARY IN H–l,“ meaning to Mary in Hannibal, of course. But while
setting up the piece I was suddenly riven from head to heel by what I
regarded as a perfect thunderbolt of humor, and I compressed it into a
snappy footnote at the bottom–thus: “We will let this thing pass, just
this once; but we wish Mr. J. Gordon Runnels to understand distinctly
that we have a character to sustain, and from this time forth when he
wants to commune with his friends in h–l, he must select some other
medium than the columns of this journal!“</p>
<p>The paper came out, and I never knew any little thing attract so much
attention as those playful trifles of mine.</p>
<p>For once the Hannibal Journal was in demand–a novelty it had not
experienced before. The whole town was stirred. Higgins dropped in with
a double-barreled shotgun early in the forenoon. When he found that it
was an infant (as he called me) that had done him the damage, he simply
pulled my ears and went away; but he threw up his situation that night
and left town for good. The tailor came with his goose and a pair of
shears; but he despised me, too, and departed for the South that night.
The two lampooned citizens came with threats of libel, and went away
incensed at my insignificance. The country editor pranced in with a
war-whoop next day, suffering for blood to drink; but he ended by
forgiving me cordially and inviting me down to the drug store to wash
away all animosity in a friendly bumper of “Fahnestock’s Vermifuge.“ It
was his little joke. My uncle was very angry when he got back
–unreasonably so, I thought, considering what an impetus I had given the
paper, and considering also that gratitude for his preservation ought to
have been uppermost in his mind, inasmuch as by his delay he had so
wonderfully escaped dissection, tomahawking, libel, and getting his head
shot off.</p>
<p>But he softened when he looked at the accounts and saw that I had
actually booked the unparalleled number of thirty-three new subscribers,
and had the vegetables to show for it, cordwood, cabbage, beans, and
unsalable turnips enough to run the family for two dears!</p>
<p>HOW THE AUTHOR WAS SOLD IN NEWARK–[Written about 1869.]</p>
<p>It is seldom pleasant to tell on oneself, but some times it is a sort
of relief to a man to make a confession. I wish to unburden my mind now,
and yet I almost believe that I am moved to do it more because I long to
bring censure upon another man than because I desire to pour balm upon
my wounded heart. (I don’t know what balm is, but I believe it is the
correct expression to use in this connection–never having seen any
balm.) You may remember that I lectured in Newark lately for the young
gentlemen of the—–Society? I did at any rate. During the afternoon of
that day I was talking with one of the young gentlemen just referred to,
and he said he had an uncle who, from some cause or other, seemed to
have grown permanently bereft of all emotion. And with tears in his
eyes, this young man said, “Oh, if I could only see him laugh once more!
Oh, if I could only see him weep!“ I was touched. I could never
withstand distress.</p>
<p>I said: “Bring him to my lecture. I’ll start him for you.“</p>
<p>“Oh, if you could but do it! If you could but do it, all our family
would bless you for evermore–for he is so very dear to us. Oh, my
benefactor, can you make him laugh? can you bring soothing tears to
those parched orbs?“</p>
<p>I was profoundly moved. I said: “My son, bring the old party round. I
have got some jokes in that lecture that will make him laugh if there is
any laugh in him; and if they miss fire, I have got some others that
will make him cry or kill him, one or the other.“ Then the young man
blessed me, and wept on my neck, and went after his uncle. He placed him
in full view, in the second row of benches, that night, and I began on
him. I tried him with mild jokes, then with severe ones; I dosed him
with bad jokes and riddled him with good ones; I fired old stale jokes
into him, and peppered him fore and aft with red-hot new ones; I warmed
up to my work, and assaulted him on the right and left, in front and
behind; I fumed and sweated and charged and ranted till I was hoarse and
sick and frantic and furious; but I never moved him once–I never started
a smile or a tear! Never a ghost of a smile, and never a suspicion of
moisture! I was astounded. I closed the lecture at last with one
despairing shriek–with one wild burst of humor, and hurled a joke of
supernatural atrocity full at him!</p>
<p>Then I sat down bewildered and exhausted.</p>
<p>The president of the society came up and bathed my head with cold
water, and said: “What made you carry on so toward the last?“</p>
<p>I said: “I was trying to make that confounded old fool laugh, in the
second row.“</p>
<p>And he said: “Well, you were wasting your time, because he is deaf
and dumb, and as blind as a badger!“</p>
<p>Now, was that any way for that old man’s nephew to impose on a
stranger and orphan like me? I ask you as a man and brother, if that was
any way for him to do?</p>
<p>THE OFFICE BORE–[Written about 1869]</p>
<p>He arrives just as regularly as the clock strikes nine in the
morning. And so he even beats the editor sometimes, and the porter must
leave his work and climb two or three pairs of stairs to unlock the
“Sanctum“ door and let him in. He lights one of the office pipes–not
reflecting, perhaps, that the editor may be one of those “stuck-up“
people who would as soon have a stranger defile his tooth-brush as his
pipe-stem. Then he begins to loll–for a person who can consent to loaf
his useless life away in ignominious indolence has not the energy to sit
up straight. He stretches full length on the sofa awhile; then draws up
to half length; then gets into a chair, hangs his head back and his arms
abroad, and stretches his legs till the rims of his boot-heels rest upon
the floor; by and by sits up and leans forward, with one leg or both
over the arm of the chair. But it is still observable that with all his
changes of position, he never assumes the upright or a fraudful
affectation of dignity. From time to time he yawns, and stretches, and
scratches himself with a tranquil, mangy enjoyment, and now and then he
grunts a kind of stuffy, overfed grunt, which is full of animal
contentment. At rare and long intervals, however, he sighs a sigh that
is the eloquent expression of a secret confession, to wit “I am useless
and a nuisance, a cumberer of the earth.“ The bore and his comrades–for
there are usually from two to four on hand, day and night–mix into the
conversation when men come in to see the editors for a moment on
business; they hold noisy talks among themselves about politics in
particular, and all other subjects in general–even warming up, after a
fashion, sometimes, and seeming to take almost a real interest in what
they are discussing. They ruthlessly call an editor from his work with
such a remark as: “Did you see this, Smith, in the Gazette?“ and proceed
to read the paragraph while the sufferer reins in his impatient pen and
listens; they often loll and sprawl round the office hour after hour,
swapping anecdotes and relating personal experiences to each other
–hairbreadth escapes, social encounters with distinguished men, election
reminiscences, sketches of odd characters, etc. And through all those
hours they never seem to comprehend that they are robbing the editors of
their time, and the public of journalistic excellence in next day’s
paper. At other times they drowse, or dreamily pore over exchanges, or
droop limp and pensive over the chair-arms for an hour. Even this solemn
silence is small respite to the editor, for the next uncomfortable thing
to having people look over his shoulders, perhaps, is to have them sit
by in silence and listen to the scratching of his pen. If a body desires
to talk private business with one of the editors, he must call him
outside, for no hint milder than blasting-powder or nitroglycerin would
be likely to move the bores out of listening-distance. To have to sit
and endure the presence of a bore day after day; to feel your cheerful
spirits begin to sink as his footstep sounds on the stair, and utterly
vanish away as his tiresome form enters the door; to suffer through his
anecdotes and die slowly to his reminiscences; to feel always the
fetters of his clogging presence; to long hopelessly for one single
day’s privacy; to note with a shudder, by and by, that to contemplate
his funeral in fancy has ceased to soothe, to imagine him undergoing in
strict and fearful detail the tortures of the ancient Inquisition has
lost its power to satisfy the heart, and that even to wish him millions
and millions and millions of miles in Tophet is able to bring only a
fitful gleam of joy; to have to endure all this, day after day, and week
after week, and month after month, is an affliction that transcends any
other that men suffer. Physical pain is pastime to it, and hanging a
pleasure excursion.</p>
