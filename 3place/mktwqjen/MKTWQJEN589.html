<p>Doom</p>
<p>He is useless on top of the ground; he ought to be under it,
inspiring the cabbages.</p>
<p>–Pudd’nhead Wilson’s Calendar</p>
<p>APRIL 1. This is the day upon which we are reminded of what we are on
the other three hundred and sixty-four.</p>
<p>–Pudd’nhead Wilson’s Calendar</p>
<p>Wilson put on enough clothes for business purposes and went to work
under a high pressure of steam. He was awake all over. All sense of
weariness had been swept away by the invigorating refreshment of the
great and hopeful discovery which he had made. He made fine and accurate
reproductions of a number of his “records,“ and then enlarged them on a
scale of ten to one with his pantograph. He did these pantograph
enlargements on sheets of white cardboard, and made each individual line
of the bewildering maze of whorls or curves or loops which consisted of
the “pattern“ of a “record“ stand out bold and black by reinforcing it
with ink. To the untrained eye the collection of delicate originals made
by the human finger on the glass plates looked about alike; but when
enlarged ten times they resembled the markings of a block of wood that
has been sawed across the grain, and the dullest eye could detect at a
glance, and at a distance of many feet, that no two of the patterns were
alike. When Wilson had at last finished his tedious and difficult work,
he arranged his results according to a plan in which a progressive order
and sequence was a principal feature; then he added to the batch several
pantograph enlargements which he had made from time to time in bygone
years.</p>
<p>The night was spent and the day well advanced now. By the time he had
snatched a trifle of breakfast, it was nine o’clock, and the court was
ready to begin its sitting. He was in his place twelve minutes later
with his “records.“</p>
<p>Tom Driscoll caught a slight glimpse of the records, and nudged his
nearest friend and said, with a wink, “Pudd’nhead’s got a rare eye to
business–thinks that as long as he can’t win his case it’s at least a
noble good chance to advertise his window palace decorations without any
expense.“ Wilson was informed that his witnesses had been delayed, but
would arrive presently; but he rose and said he should probably not have
occasion to make use of their testimony. [An amused murmur ran through
the room: “It’s a clean backdown! he gives up without hitting a lick!“]
Wilson continued: “I have other testimony–and better. [This compelled
interest, and evoked murmurs of surprise that had a detectable
ingredient of disappointment in them.] If I seem to be springing this
evidence upon the court, I offer as my justification for this, that I
did not discover its existence until late last night, and have been
engaged in examining and classifying it ever since, until half an hour
ago. I shall offer it presently; but first I wish to say a few
preliminary words.</p>
<p>“May it please the court, the claim given the front place, the claim
most persistently urged, the claim most strenuously and I may even say
aggressively and defiantly insisted upon by the prosecution is this–that
the person whose hand left the bloodstained fingerprints upon the handle
of the Indian knife is the person who committed the murder.“ Wilson
paused, during several moments, to give impressiveness to what he was
about to say, and then added tranquilly, “WE GRANT THAT CLAIM.“</p>
<p>It was an electrical surprise. No one was prepared for such an
admission. A buzz of astonishment rose on all sides, and people were
heard to intimate that the overworked lawyer had lost his mind. Even the
veteran judge, accustomed as he was to legal ambushes and masked
batteries in criminal procedure, was not sure that his ears were not
deceiving him, and asked counsel what it was he had said. Howard’s
impassive face betrayed no sign, but his attitude and bearing lost
something of their careless confidence for a moment. Wilson resumed:</p>
<p>“We not only grant that claim, but we welcome it and strongly endorse
it. Leaving that matter for the present, we will now proceed to consider
other points in the case which we propose to establish by evidence, and
shall include that one in the chain in its proper place.“</p>
<p>He had made up his mind to try a few hardy guesses, in mapping out
his theory of the origin and motive of the murder–guesses designed to
fill up gaps in it–guesses which could help if they hit, and would
probably do no harm if they didn’t.</p>
<p>“To my mind, certain circumstances of the case before the court seem
to suggest a motive for the homicide quite different from the one
insisted on by the state. It is my conviction that the motive was not
revenge, but robbery. It has been urged that the presence of the accused
brothers in that fatal room, just after notification that one of them
must take the life of Judge Driscoll or lose his own the moment the
parties should meet, clearly signifies that the natural instinct of
self-preservation moved my clients to go there secretly and save Count
Luigi by destroying his adversary.</p>
<p>“Then why did they stay there, after the deed was done? Mrs. Pratt
had time, although she did not hear the cry for help, but woke up some
moments later, to run to that room–and there she found these men
standing and making no effort to escape. If they were guilty, they ought
to have been running out of the house at the same time that she was
running to that room. If they had had such a strong instinct toward
self-preservation as to move them to kill that unarmed man, what had
become of it now, when it should have been more alert than ever. Would
any of us have remained there? Let us not slander our intelligence to
that degree.</p>
<p>“Much stress has been laid upon the fact that the accused offered a
very large reward for the knife with which this murder was done; that no
thief came forward to claim that extraordinary reward; that the latter
fact was good circumstantial evidence that the claim that the knife had
been stolen was a vanity and a fraud; that these details taken in
connection with the memorable and apparently prophetic speech of the
deceased concerning that knife, and the finally discovery of that very
knife in the fatal room where no living person was found present with
the slaughtered man but the owner of the knife and his brother, form an
indestructible chain of evidence which fixed the crime upon those
unfortunate strangers.</p>
<p>“But I shall presently ask to be sworn, and shall testify that there
was a large reward offered for the THIEF, also; and it was offered
secretly and not advertised; that this fact was indiscreetly
mentioned–or at least tacitly admitted–in what was supposed to be safe
circumstances, but may NOT have been. The thief may have been present
himself. [Tom Driscoll had been looking at the speaker, but dropped his
eyes at this point.] In that case he would retain the knife in his
possession, not daring to offer it for sale, or for pledge in a
pawnshop. [There was a nodding of heads among the audience by way of
admission that this was not a bad stroke.] I shall prove to the
satisfaction of the jury that there WAS a person in Judge Driscoll’s
room several minutes before the accused entered it. [This produced a
strong sensation; the last drowsy head in the courtroom roused up now,
and made preparation to listen.] If it shall seem necessary, I will
prove by the Misses Clarkson that they met a veiled person–ostensibly a
woman–coming out of the back gate a few minutes after the cry for help
was heard. This person was not a woman, but a man dressed in woman’s
clothes.“ Another sensation. Wilson had his eye on Tom when he hazarded
this guess, to see what effect it would produce. He was satisfied with
the result, and said to himself, “It was a success–he’s hit!“</p>
<p>The object of that person in that house was robbery, not murder. It
is true that the safe was not open, but there was an ordinary cashbox on
the table, with three thousand dollars in it. It is easily supposable
that the thief was concealed in the house; that he knew of this box, and
of its owner’s habit of counting its contents and arranging his accounts
at night–if he had that habit, which I do not assert, of course–that he
tried to take the box while its owner slept, but made a noise and was
seized, and had to use the knife to save himself from capture; and that
he fled without his booty because he heard help coming.</p>
<p>“I have now done with my theory, and will proceed to the evidences by
which I propose to try to prove its soundness.“ Wilson took up several
of his strips of glass. When the audience recognized these familiar
mementos of Pudd’nhead’s old time childish “puttering“ and folly, the
tense and funereal interest vanished out of their faces, and the house
burst into volleys of relieving and refreshing laughter, and Tom chirked
up and joined in the fun himself; but Wilson was apparently not
disturbed. He arranged his records on the table before him, and
said:</p>
<p>“I beg the indulgence of the court while I make a few remarks in
explanation of some evidence which I am about to introduce, and which I
shall presently ask to be allowed to verify under oath on the witness
stand. Every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave
certain physical marks which do not change their character, and by which
he can always be identified–and that without shade of doubt or question.
These marks are his signature, his physiological autograph, so to speak,
and this autograph can not be counterfeited, nor can he disguise it or
hide it away, nor can it become illegible by the wear and mutations of
time. This signature is not his face–age can change that beyond
recognition; it is not his hair, for that can fall out; it is not his
height, for duplicates of that exist; it is not his form, for duplicates
of that exist also, whereas this signature is each man’s very own–there
is no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the globe! [The
audience were interested once more.]</p>
<p>“This autograph consists of the delicate lines or corrugations with
which Nature marks the insides of the hands and the soles of the feet.
If you will look at the balls of your fingers–you that have very sharp
eyesight–you will observe that these dainty curving lines lie close
together, like those that indicate the borders of oceans in maps, and
that they form various clearly defined patterns, such as arches,
circles, long curves, whorls, etc., and that these patterns differ on
the different fingers. [Every man in the room had his hand up to the
light now, and his head canted to one side, and was minutely
scrutinizing the balls of his fingers; there were whispered ejaculations
of “Why, it’s so–I never noticed that before!“] The patterns on the
right hand are not the same as those on the left. [Ejaculations of “Why,
that’s so, too!“] Taken finger for finger, your patterns differ from
your neighbor’s. [Comparisons were made all over the house–even the
judge and jury were absorbed in this curious work.] The patterns of a
twin’s right hand are not the same as those on his left. One twin’s
patters are never the same as his fellow twin’s patters–the jury will
find that the patterns upon the finger balls of the twins’ hands follow
this rule. [An examination of the twins’ hands was begun at once.] You
have often heard of twins who were so exactly alike that when dressed
alike their own parents could not tell them apart. Yet there was never a
twin born in to this world that did not carry from birth to death a sure
identifier in this mysterious and marvelous natal autograph. That once
known to you, his fellow twin could never personate him and deceive
you.“</p>
<p>Wilson stopped and stood silent. Inattention dies a quick and sure
death when a speaker does that. The stillness gives warning that
something is coming. All palms and finger balls went down now, all
slouching forms straightened, all heads came up, all eyes were fastened
upon Wilson’s face. He waited yet one, two, three moments, to let his
pause complete and perfect its spell upon the house; then, when through
the profound hush he could hear the ticking of the clock on the wall, he
put out his hand and took the Indian knife by the blade and held it
aloft where all could see the sinister spots upon its ivory handle; then
he said, in a level and passionless voice:</p>
<p>“Upon this haft stands the assassin’s natal autograph, written in the
blood of that helpless and unoffending old man who loved you and whom
you all loved. There is but one man in the whole earth whose hand can
duplicate that crimson sign“–he paused and raised his eyes to the
pendulum swinging back and forth–“and please God we will produce that
man in this room before the clock strikes noon!“</p>
<p>Stunned, distraught, unconscious of its own movement, the house half
rose, as if expecting to see the murderer appear at the door, and a
breeze of muttered ejaculations swept the place. “Order in the
court!–sit down!“ This from the sheriff. He was obeyed, and quiet
reigned again. Wilson stole a glance at Tom, and said to himself, “He is
flying signals of distress now; even people who despise him are pitying
him; they think this is a hard ordeal for a young fellow who has lost
his benefactor by so cruel a stroke–and they are right.“ He resumed his
speech:</p>
<p>“For more than twenty years I have amused my compulsory leisure with
collecting these curious physical signatures in this town. At my house I
have hundreds upon hundreds of them. Each and every one is labeled with
name and date; not labeled the next day or even the next hour, but in
the very minute that the impression was taken. When I go upon the
witness stand I will repeat under oath the things which I am now saying.
I have the fingerprints of the court, the sheriff, and every member of
the jury. There is hardly a person in this room, white or black, whose
natal signature I cannot produce, and not one of them can so disguise
himself that I cannot pick him out from a multitude of his fellow
creatures and unerringly identify him by his hands. And if he and I
should live to be a hundred I could still do it. [The interest of the
audience was steadily deepening now.]</p>
<p>“I have studied some of these signatures so much that I know them as
well as the bank cashier knows the autograph of his oldest customer.
While I turn my back now, I beg that several persons will be so good as
to pass their fingers through their hair, and then press them upon one
of the panes of the window near the jury, and that among them the
accused may set THEIR finger marks. Also, I beg that these
experimenters, or others, will set their fingers upon another pane, and
add again the marks of the accused, but not placing them in the same
order or relation to the other signatures as before–for, by one chance
in a million, a person might happen upon the right marks by pure
guesswork, ONCE, therefore I wish to be tested twice.“</p>
<p>He turned his back, and the two panes were quickly covered with
delicately lined oval spots, but visible only to such persons as could
get a dark background for them–the foliage of a tree, outside, for
instance. Then upon call, Wilson went to the window, made his
examination, and said:</p>
<p>“This is Count Luigi’s right hand; this one, three signatures below,
is his left. Here is Count Angelo’s right; down here is his left. Now
for the other pane: here and here are Count Luigi’s, here and here are
his brother’s.“ He faced about. “Am I right?“</p>
<p>A deafening explosion of applause was the answer. The bench said:</p>
<p>“This certainly approaches the miraculous!“</p>
<p>Wilson turned to the window again and remarked, pointing with his
finger:</p>
<p>“This is the signature of Mr. Justice Robinson. [Applause.] This, of
Constable Blake. [Applause.] This of John Mason, juryman. [Applause.]
This, of the sheriff. [Applause.] I cannot name the others, but I have
them all at home, named and dated, and could identify them all by my
fingerprint records.“</p>
<p>He moved to his place through a storm of applause–which the sheriff
stopped, and also made the people sit down, for they were all standing
and struggling to see, of course. Court, jury, sheriff, and everybody
had been too absorbed in observing Wilson’s performance to attend to the
audience earlier.</p>
<p>“Now then,“ said Wilson, “I have here the natal autographs of the two
children–thrown up to ten times the natural size by the pantograph, so
that anyone who can see at all can tell the markings apart at a glance.
We will call the children A and B. Here are A’s finger marks, taken at
the age of five months. Here they are again taken at seven months. [Tom
started.] They are alike, you see. Here are B’s at five months, and also
at seven months. They, too, exactly copy each other, but the patterns
are quite different from A’s, you observe. I shall refer to these again
presently, but we will turn them face down now.</p>
<p>“Here, thrown up ten sizes, are the natal autographs of the two
persons who are here before you accused of murdering Judge Driscoll. I
made these pantograph copies last night, and will so swear when I go
upon the witness stand. I ask the jury to compare them with the finger
marks of the accused upon the windowpanes, and tell the court if they
are the same.“</p>
<p>He passed a powerful magnifying glass to the foreman.</p>
<p>One juryman after another took the cardboard and the glass and made
the comparison. Then the foreman said to the judge:</p>
<p>“Your honor, we are all agreed that they are identical.“</p>
<p>Wilson said to the foreman:</p>
<p>“Please turn that cardboard face down, and take this one, and compare
it searchingly, by the magnifier, with the fatal signature upon the
knife handle, and report your finding to the court.“</p>
<p>Again the jury made minute examinations, and again reported:</p>
<p>“We find them to be exactly identical, your honor.“</p>
<p>Wilson turned toward the counsel for the prosecution, and there was a
clearly recognizable note of warning in his voice when he said:</p>
<p>“May it please the court, the state has claimed, strenuously and
persistently, that the bloodstained fingerprints upon that knife handle
were left there by the assassin of Judge Driscoll. You have heard us
grant that claim, and welcome it.“ He turned to the jury: “Compare the
fingerprints of the accused with the fingerprints left by the
assassin–and report.“</p>
<p>The comparison began. As it proceeded, all movement and all sound
ceased, and the deep silence of an absorbed and waiting suspense settled
upon the house; and when at last the words came, “THEY DO NOT EVEN
RESEMBLE,“ a thundercrash of applause followed and the house sprang to
its feet, but was quickly repressed by official force and brought to
order again. Tom was altering his position every few minutes now, but
none of his changes brought repose nor any small trifle of comfort. When
the house’s attention was become fixed once more, Wilson said gravely,
indicating the twins with a gesture:</p>
<p>“These men are innocent–I have no further concern with them. [Another
outbreak of applause began, but was promptly checked.] We will now
proceed to find the guilty. [Tom’s eyes were starting from their
sockets–yes, it was a cruel day for the bereaved youth, everybody
thought.] We will return to the infant autographs of A and B. I will ask
the jury to take these large pantograph facsimilies of A’s marked five
months and seven months. Do they tally?“</p>
<p>The foreman responded: “Perfectly.“</p>
<p>“Now examine this pantograph, taken at eight months, and also marked
A. Does it tally with the other two?“</p>
<p>The surprised response was:</p>
<p>“NO–THEY DIFFER WIDELY!“</p>
<p>“You are quite right. Now take these two pantographs of B’s
autograph, marked five months and seven months. Do they tally with each
other?“</p>
<p>“Yes–perfectly.“</p>
<p>“Take this third pantograph marked B, eight months. Does it tally
with B’s other two?“</p>
<p>“BY NO MEANS!“</p>
<p>“Do you know how to account for those strange discrepancies? I will
tell you. For a purpose unknown to us, but probably a selfish one,
somebody changed those children in the cradle.“</p>
<p>This produced a vast sensation, naturally; Roxana was astonished at
this admirable guess, but not disturbed by it. To guess the exchange was
one thing, to guess who did it quite another. Pudd’nhead Wilson could do
wonderful things, no doubt, but he couldn’t do impossible ones. Safe?
She was perfectly safe. She smiled privately.</p>
<p>“Between the ages of seven months and eight months those children
were changed in the cradle“–he made one of this effect–collecting
pauses, and added–“and the person who did it is in this house!“</p>
<p>Roxy’s pulses stood still! The house was thrilled as with an electric
shock, and the people half rose as if to seek a glimpse of the person
who had made that exchange. Tom was growing limp; the life seemed oozing
out of him. Wilson resumed:</p>
<p>“A was put into B’s cradle in the nursery; B was transferred to the
kitchen and became a Negro and a slave [Sensation–confusion of angry
ejaculations]–but within a quarter of an hour he will stand before you
white and free! [Burst of applause, checked by the officers.] From seven
months onward until now, A has still been a usurper, and in my finger
record he bears B’s name. Here is his pantograph at the age of twelve.
Compare it with the assassin’s signature upon the knife handle. Do they
tally?“</p>
<p>The foreman answered:</p>
<p>“TO THE MINUTEST DETAIL!“</p>
<p>Wilson said, solemnly:</p>
<p>“The murderer of your friend and mine–York Driscoll of the generous
hand and the kindly spirit–sits in among you. Valet de Chambre, Negro
and slave–falsely called Thomas a Becket Driscoll–make upon the window
the fingerprints that will hang you!“</p>
<p>Tom turned his ashen face imploring toward the speaker, made some
impotent movements with his white lips, then slid limp and lifeless to
the floor.</p>
<p>Wilson broke the awed silence with the words:</p>
<p>“There is no need. He has confessed.“</p>
<p>Roxy flung herself upon her knees, covered her face with her hands,
and out through her sobs the words struggled:</p>
<p>“De Lord have mercy on me, po’ misasble sinner dat I is!“</p>
<p>The clock struck twelve.</p>
<p>The court rose; the new prisoner, handcuffed, was removed.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>It is often the case that the man who can’t tell a lie thinks he is
the best judge of one.</p>
<p>–Pudd’nhead Wilson’s Calendar</p>
<p>OCTOBER 12, THE DISCOVERY. It was wonderful to find America, but it
would have been more wonderful to miss it.</p>
<p>–Pudd’nhead Wilson’s Calendar</p>
<p>The town sat up all night to discuss the amazing events of the day
and swap guesses as to when Tom’s trial would begin. Troop after troop
of citizens came to serenade Wilson, and require a speech, and shout
themselves hoarse over every sentence that fell from his lips–for all
his sentences were golden, now, all were marvelous. His long fight
against hard luck and prejudice was ended; he was a made man for good.
And as each of these roaring gangs of enthusiasts marched away, some
remorseful member of it was quite sure to raise his voice and say:</p>
<p>“And this is the man the likes of us have called a pudd’nhead for
more than twenty years. He has resigned from that position,
friends.“</p>
<p>“Yes, but it isn’t vacant–we’re elected.“</p>
<p>The twins were heroes of romance, now, and with rehabilitated
reputations. But they were weary of Western adventure, and straightway
retired to Europe.</p>
<p>Roxy’s heart was broken. The young fellow upon whom she had inflicted
twenty-three years of slavery continued the false heir’s pension of
thirty-five dollars a month to her, but her hurts were too deep for
money to heal; the spirit in her eye was quenched, her martial bearing
departed with it, and the voice of her laughter ceased in the land. In
her church and its affairs she found her only solace.</p>
<p>The real heir suddenly found himself rich and free, but in a most
embarrassing situation. He could neither read nor write, and his speech
was the basest dialect of the Negro quarter. His gait, his attitudes,
his gestures, his bearing, his laugh–all were vulgar and uncouth; his
manners were the manners of a slave. Money and fine clothes could not
mend these defects or cover them up; they only made them more glaring
and the more pathetic. The poor fellow could not endure the terrors of
the white man’s parlor, and felt at home and at peace nowhere but in the
kitchen. The family pew was a misery to him, yet he could nevermore
enter into the solacing refuge of the “nigger gallery“–that was closed
to him for good and all. But we cannot follow his curious fate
further–that would be a long story.</p>
<p>The false heir made a full confession and was sentenced to
imprisonment for life. But now a complication came up. The Percy
Driscoll estate was in such a crippled shape when its owner died that it
could pay only sixty percent of its great indebtedness, and was settled
at that rate. But the creditors came forward now, and complained that
inasmuch as through an error for which THEY were in no way to blame the
false heir was not inventoried at the time with the rest of the
property, great wrong and loss had thereby been inflicted upon them.
They rightly claimed that “Tom“ was lawfully their property and had been
so for eight years; that they had already lost sufficiently in being
deprived of his services during that long period, and ought not to be
required to add anything to that loss; that if he had been delivered up
to them in the first place, they would have sold him and he could not
have murdered Judge Driscoll; therefore it was not that he had really
committed the murder, the guilt lay with the erroneous inventory.
Everybody saw that there was reason in this. Everybody granted that if
“Tom“ were white and free it would be unquestionably right to punish
him–it would be no loss to anybody; but to shut up a valuable slave for
life–that was quite another matter.</p>
<p>As soon as the Governor understood the case, he pardoned Tom at once,
and the creditors sold him down the river.</p>
<p>Author’s Note to THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS</p>
<p>A man who is not born with the novel-writing gift has a troublesome
time of it when he tries to build a novel. I know this from experience.
He has no clear idea of his story; in fact he has no story. He merely
has some people in his mind, and an incident or two, also a locality,
and he trusts he can plunge those people into those incidents with
interesting results. So he goes to work. To write a novel? No–that is a
thought which comes later; in the beginning he is only proposing to tell
a little tale, a very little tale, a six-page tale. But as it is a tale
which he is not acquainted with, and can only find out what it is by
listening as it goes along telling itself, it is more than apt to go on
and on and on till it spreads itself into a book. I know about this,
because it has happened to me so many times.</p>
<p>And I have noticed another thing: that as the short tale grows into
the long tale, the original intention (or motif) is apt to get abolished
and find itself superseded by a quite different one. It was so in the
case of a magazine sketch which I once started to write–a funny and
fantastic sketch about a prince and a pauper; it presently assumed a
grave cast of its own accord, and in that new shape spread itself out
into a book. Much the same thing happened with PUDD’NHEAD WILSON. I had
a sufficiently hard time with that tale, because it changed itself from
a farce to a tragedy while I was going along with it–a most embarrassing
circumstance. But what was a great deal worse was, that it was not one
story, but two stories tangled together; and they obstructed and
interrupted each other at every turn and created no end of confusion and
annoyance. I could not offer the book for publication, for I was afraid
it would unseat the reader’s reason, I did not know what was the matter
with it, for I had not noticed, as yet, that it was two stories in one.
It took me months to make that discovery. I carried the manuscript back
and forth across the Atlantic two or three times, and read it and
studied over it on shipboard; and at last I saw where the difficulty
lay. I had no further trouble. I pulled one of the stories out by the
roots, and left the other–a kind of literary Caesarean operation.</p>
<p>Would the reader care to know something about the story which I
pulled out? He has been told many a time how the born-and-trained
novelist works; won’t he let me round and complete his knowledge by
telling him how the jackleg does it?</p>
<p>Originally the story was called THOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS. I meant to
make it very short. I had seen a picture of a youthful Italian
“freak“–or “freaks“–which was–or which were–on exhibition in our
cities–a combination consisting of two heads and four arms joined to a
single body and a single pair of legs–and I thought I would write an
extravagantly fantastic little story with this freak of nature for
hero–or heroes–a silly young miss for heroine, and two old ladies and
two boys for the minor parts. I lavishly elaborated these people and
their doings, of course. But the take kept spreading along and spreading
along, and other people got to intruding themselves and taking up more
and more room with their talk and their affairs. Among them came a
stranger named Pudd’nhead Wilson, and woman named Roxana; and presently
the doings of these two pushed up into prominence a young fellow named
Tom Driscoll, whose proper place was away in the obscure background.
Before the book was half finished those three were taking things almost
entirely into their own hands and working the whole tale as a private
venture of their own–a tale which they had nothing at all to do with, by
rights.</p>
<p>When the book was finished and I came to look around to see what had
become of the team I had originally started out with–Aunt Patsy Cooper,
Aunt Betsy Hale, and two boys, and Rowena the lightweight heroine–they
were nowhere to be seen; they had disappeared from the story some time
or other. I hunted about and found them–found them stranded, idle,
forgotten, and permanently useless. It was very awkward. It was awkward
all around, but more particularly in the case of Rowena, because there
was a love match on, between her and one of the twins that constituted
the freak, and I had worked it up to a blistering heat and thrown in a
quite dramatic love quarrel, wherein Rowena scathingly denounced her
betrothed for getting drunk, and scoffed at his explanation of how it
had happened, and wouldn’t listen to it, and had driven him from her in
the usual “forever“ way; and now here she sat crying and brokenhearted;
for she had found that he had spoken only the truth; that is was not he,
but the other of the freak that had drunk the liquor that made him
drunk; that her half was a prohibitionist and had never drunk a drop in
his life, and altogether tight as a brick three days in the week, was
wholly innocent of blame; and indeed, when sober, was constantly doing
all he could to reform his brother, the other half, who never got any
satisfaction out of drinking, anyway, because liquor never affected him.
Yes, here she was, stranded with that deep injustice of hers torturing
her poor torn heart.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to do with her. I was as sorry for her as anybody
could be, but the campaign was over, the book was finished, she was
sidetracked, and there was no possible way of crowding her in, anywhere.
I could not leave her there, of course; it would not do. After spreading
her out so, and making such a to-do over her affairs, it would be
absolutely necessary to account to the reader for her. I thought and
thought and studied and studied; but I arrived at nothing. I finally saw
plainly that there was really no way but one–I must simply give her the
grand bounce. It grieved me to do it, for after associating with her so
much I had come to kind of like her after a fashion, notwithstanding
things and was so nauseatingly sentimental. Still it had to be done. So
at the top of Chapter XVII I put a “Calendar“ remark concerning July the
Fourth, and began the chapter with this statistic:</p>
<p>“Rowena went out in the backyard after supper to see the fireworks
and fell down the well and got drowned.“</p>
<p>It seemed abrupt, but I thought maybe the reader wouldn’t notice it,
because I changed the subject right away to something else. Anyway it
loosened up Rowena from where she was stuck and got her out of the way,
and that was the main thing. It seemed a prompt good way of weeding out
people that had got stalled, and a plenty good enough way for those
others; so I hunted up the two boys and said, “They went out back one
night to stone the cat and fell down the well and got drowned.“ Next I
searched around and found old Aunt Patsy and Aunt Betsy Hale where they
were around, and said, “They went out back one night to visit the sick
and fell down the well and got drowned.“ I was going to drown some
others, but I gave up the idea, partly because I believed that if I kept
that up it would arouse attention, and perhaps sympathy with those
people, and partly because it was not a large well and would not hold
any more anyway.</p>
<p>Still the story was unsatisfactory. Here was a set of new characters
who were become inordinately prominent and who persisted in remaining so
to the end; and back yonder was an older set who made a large noise and
a great to-do for a little while and then suddenly played out utterly
and fell down the well. There was a radical defect somewhere, and I must
search it out and cure it.</p>
<p>The defect turned out to be the one already spoken of–two stories in
one, a farce and a tragedy. So I pulled out the farce and left the
tragedy. This left the original team in, but only as mere names, not as
characters. Their prominence was wholly gone; they were not even worth
drowning; so I removed that detail. Also I took the twins apart and made
two separate men of them. They had no occasion to have foreign names
now, but it was too much trouble to remove them all through, so I left
them christened as they were and made no explanation.</p>
<p>End of The Tragedy of Pudd’nhead Wilson by Mark Twain (Samuel
