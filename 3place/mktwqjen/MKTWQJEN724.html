<h4 id="chapter-xxxix.">CHAPTER XXXIX.</h4>
<p>By trying we can easily learn to endure adversity. Another man’s, I
mean. –Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>You soon find your long-ago dreams of India rising in a sort of vague
and luscious moonlight above the horizon-rim of your opaque
consciousness, and softly lighting up a thousand forgotten details which
were parts of a vision that had once been vivid to you when you were a
boy, and steeped your spirit in tales of the East. The barbaric
gorgeousnesses, for instance; and the princely titles, the sumptuous
titles, the sounding titles,–how good they taste in the mouth! The Nizam
of Hyderabad; the Maharajah of Travancore; the Nabob of Jubbelpore; the
Begum of Bhopal; the Nawab of Mysore; the Rance of Gulnare; the Ahkoond
of Swat’s; the Rao of Rohilkund; the Gaikwar of Baroda. Indeed, it is a
country that runs richly to name. The great god Vishnu has 108–108
special ones–108 peculiarly holy ones–names just for Sunday use only. I
learned the whole of Vishnu’s 108 by heart once, but they wouldn’t stay;
I don’t remember any of them now but John W.</p>
<p>And the romances connected with, those princely native houses–to this
day they are always turning up, just as in the old, old times. They were
sweating out a romance in an English court in Bombay a while before we
were there. In this case a native prince, 16 1/2 years old, who has been
enjoying his titles and dignities and estates unmolested for fourteen
years, is suddenly haled into court on the charge that he is rightfully
no prince at all, but a pauper peasant; that the real prince died when
two and one-half years old; that the death was concealed, and a peasant
child smuggled into the royal cradle, and that this present incumbent
was that smuggled substitute. This is the very material that so many
oriental tales have been made of.</p>
<p>The case of that great prince, the Gaikwar of Baroda, is a reversal
of the theme. When that throne fell vacant, no heir could be found for
some time, but at last one was found in the person of a peasant child
who was making mud pies in a village street, and having an innocent good
time. But his pedigree was straight; he was the true prince, and he has
reigned ever since, with none to dispute his right.</p>
<p>Lately there was another hunt for an heir to another princely house,
and one was found who was circumstanced about as the Gaikwar had been.
His fathers were traced back, in humble life, along a branch of the
ancestral tree to the point where it joined the stem fourteen
generations ago, and his heirship was thereby squarely established. The
tracing was done by means of the records of one of the great Hindoo
shrines, where princes on pilgrimage record their names and the date of
their visit. This is to keep the prince’s religious account straight,
and his spiritual person safe; but the record has the added value of
keeping the pedigree authentic, too.</p>
<p>When I think of Bombay now, at this distance of time, I seem to have
a kaleidoscope at my eye; and I hear the clash of the glass bits as the
splendid figures change, and fall apart, and flash into new forms,
figure after figure, and with the birth of each new form I feel my skin
crinkle and my nerve-web tingle with a new thrill of wonder and delight.
These remembered pictures float past me in a sequence of contracts;
following the same order always, and always whirling by and disappearing
with the swiftness of a dream, leaving me with the sense that the
actuality was the experience of an hour, at most, whereas it really
covered days, I think.</p>
<p>The series begins with the hiring of a “bearer“–native man-servant–a
person who should be selected with some care, because as long as he is
in your employ he will be about as near to you as your clothes.</p>
<p>In India your day may be said to begin with the “bearer’s“ knock on
the bedroom door, accompanied by a formula of, words–a formula which is
intended to mean that the bath is ready. It doesn’t really seem to mean
anything at all. But that is because you are not used to “bearer“
English. You will presently understand.</p>
<p>Where he gets his English is his own secret. There is nothing like it
elsewhere in the earth; or even in paradise, perhaps, but the other
place is probably full of it. You hire him as soon as you touch Indian
soil; for no matter what your sex is, you cannot do without him. He is
messenger, valet, chambermaid, table-waiter, lady’s maid, courier–he is
everything. He carries a coarse linen clothes-bag and a quilt; he sleeps
on the stone floor outside your chamber door, and gets his meals you do
not know where nor when; you only know that he is not fed on the
premises, either when you are in a hotel or when you are a guest in a,
private house. His wages are large–from an Indian point of view–and he
feeds and clothes himself out of them. We had three of him in two and a
half months. The first one’s rate was thirty rupees a month that is to
say, twenty-seven cents a day; the rate of the others, Rs. 40 (40
rupees) a month. A princely sum; for the native switchman on a railway
and the native servant in a private family get only Rs. 7 per month, and
the farm-hand only 4. The two former feed and clothe themselves and
their families on their .90 per month; but I cannot believe that the
farmhand has to feed himself on his .08. I think the farm probably feeds
him, and that the whole of his wages, except a trifle for the priest, go
to the support of his family. That is, to the feeding of his family; for
they live in a mud hut, hand-made, and, doubtless, rent-free, and they
wear no clothes; at least, nothing more than a rag. And not much of a
rag at that, in the case of the males. However, these are handsome times
for the farm-hand; he was not always the child of luxury that he is now.
The Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, in a recent official
utterance wherein he was rebuking a native deputation for complaining of
hard times, reminded them that they could easily remember when a
farm-hand’s wages were only half a rupee (former value) a month–that is
to say, less than a cent a day; nearly .90 a year. If such a wage-earner
had a good deal of a family–and they all have that, for God is very good
to these poor natives in some ways–he would save a profit of fifteen
cents, clean and clear, out of his year’s toil; I mean a frugal, thrifty
person would, not one given to display and ostentation. And if he owed
3.50 and took good care of his health, he could pay it off in ninety
years. Then he could hold up his head, and look his creditors in the
face again.</p>
<p>Think of these facts and what they mean. India does not consist of
cities. There are no cities in India–to speak of. Its stupendous
population consists of farm-laborers. India is one vast farm–one almost
interminable stretch of fields with mud fences between. . . Think of the
above facts; and consider what an incredible aggregate of poverty they
place before you.</p>
<p>The first Bearer that applied, waited below and sent up his
recommendations. That was the first morning in Bombay. We read them
over; carefully, cautiously, thoughtfully. There was not a fault to find
with them–except one; they were all from Americans. Is that a slur? If
it is, it is a deserved one. In my experience, an American’s
recommendation of a servant is not usually valuable. We are too
good-natured a race; we hate to say the unpleasant thing; we shrink from
speaking the unkind truth about a poor fellow whose bread depends upon
our verdict; so we speak of his good points only, thus not scrupling to
tell a lie–a silent lie–for in not mentioning his bad ones we as good as
say he hasn’t any. The only difference that I know of between a silent
lie and a spoken one is, that the silent lie is a less respectable one
than the other. And it can deceive, whereas the other can’t–as a rule.
We not only tell the silent lie as to a servant’s faults, but we sin in
another way: we overpraise his merits; for when it comes to writing
recommendations of servants we are a nation of gushers. And we have not
the Frenchman’s excuse. In France you must give the departing servant a
good recommendation; and you must conceal his faults; you have no
choice. If you mention his faults for the protection of the next
candidate for his services, he can sue you for damages; and the court
will award them, too; and, moreover, the judge will give you a sharp
dressing-down from the bench for trying to destroy a poor man’s
character, and rob him of his bread. I do not state this on my own
authority, I got it from a French physician of fame and repute–a man who
was born in Paris, and had practiced there all his life. And he said
that he spoke not merely from common knowledge, but from exasperating
personal experience.</p>
<p>As I was saying, the Bearer’s recommendations were all from American
tourists; and St. Peter would have admitted him to the fields of the
blest on them–I mean if he is as unfamiliar with our people and our ways
as I suppose he is. According to these recommendations, Manuel X. was
supreme in all the arts connected with his complex trade; and these
manifold arts were mentioned–and praised-in detail. His English was
spoken of in terms of warm admiration–admiration verging upon rapture. I
took pleased note of that, and hoped that some of it might be true.</p>
<p>We had to have some one right away; so the family went down stairs
and took him a week on trial; then sent him up to me and departed on
their affairs. I was shut up in my quarters with a bronchial cough, and
glad to have something fresh to look at, something new to play with.
Manuel filled the bill; Manuel was very welcome. He was toward fifty
years old, tall, slender, with a slight stoop–an artificial stoop, a
deferential stoop, a stoop rigidified by long habit–with face of
European mould; short hair intensely black; gentle black eyes, timid
black eyes, indeed; complexion very dark, nearly black in fact; face
smooth-shaven. He was bareheaded and barefooted, and was never otherwise
while his week with us lasted; his clothing was European, cheap, flimsy,
and showed much wear.</p>
<p>He stood before me and inclined his head (and body) in the pathetic
Indian way, touching his forehead with the finger–ends of his right
hand, in salute. I said:</p>
<p>“Manuel, you are evidently Indian, but you seem to have a Spanish
name when you put it all together. How is that?“</p>
<p>A perplexed look gathered in his face; it was plain that he had not
understood–but he didn’t let on. He spoke back placidly.</p>
<p>“Name, Manuel. Yes, master.“</p>
<p>“I know; but how did you get the name?“</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, I suppose. Think happen so. Father same name, not
mother.“</p>
<p>I saw that I must simplify my language and spread my words apart, if
I would be understood by this English scholar.</p>
<p>“Well–then–how–did–your–father–get–his name?“</p>
<p>“Oh, he,“–brightening a little–“he Christian–Portygee; live in Goa; I
born Goa; mother not Portygee, mother native-high-caste Brahmin–Coolin
Brahmin; highest caste; no other so high caste. I high-caste Brahmin,
too. Christian, too, same like father; high-caste Christian Brahmin,
master–Salvation Army.“</p>
<p>All this haltingly, and with difficulty. Then he had an inspiration,
and began to pour out a flood of words that I could make nothing of; so
I said:</p>
<p>“There–don’t do that. I can’t understand Hindostani.“</p>
<p>“Not Hindostani, master–English. Always I speaking English sometimes
when I talking every day all the time at you.“</p>
<p>“Very well, stick to that; that is intelligible. It is not up to my
hopes, it is not up to the promise of the recommendations, still it is
English, and I understand it. Don’t elaborate it; I don’t like
elaborations when they are crippled by uncertainty of touch.“</p>
<p>“Master?“</p>
<p>“Oh, never mind; it was only a random thought; I didn’t expect you to
understand it. How did you get your English; is it an acquirement, or
just a gift of God?“</p>
<p>After some hesitation–piously:</p>
<p>“Yes, he very good. Christian god very good, Hindoo god very good,
too. Two million Hindoo god, one Christian god–make two million and one.
All mine; two million and one god. I got a plenty. Sometime I pray all
time at those, keep it up, go all time every day; give something at
shrine, all good for me, make me better man; good for me, good for my
family, dam good.“</p>
<p>Then he had another inspiration, and went rambling off into fervent
confusions and incoherencies, and I had to stop him again. I thought we
had talked enough, so I told him to go to the bathroom and clean it up
and remove the slops–this to get rid of him. He went away, seeming to
understand, and got out some of my clothes and began to brush them. I
repeated my desire several times, simplifying and re-simplifying it, and
at last he got the idea. Then he went away and put a coolie at the work,
and explained that he would lose caste if he did it himself; it would be
pollution, by the law of his caste, and it would cost him a deal of fuss
and trouble to purify himself and accomplish his rehabilitation. He said
that that kind of work was strictly forbidden to persons of caste, and
as strictly restricted to the very bottom layer of Hindoo society–the
despised ‘Sudra’ (the toiler, the laborer). He was right; and apparently
the poor Sudra has been content with his strange lot, his insulting
distinction, for ages and ages–clear back to the beginning of things, so
to speak. Buckle says that his name–laborer–is a term of contempt; that
it is ordained by the Institutes of Menu (900 B.C.) that if a Sudra sit
on a level with his superior he shall be exiled or branded–[Without
going into particulars I will remark that as a rule they wear no
clothing that would conceal the brand.–M. T.]. . . ; if he speak
contemptuously of his superior or insult him he shall suffer death; if
he listen to the reading of the sacred books he shall have burning oil
poured in his ears; if he memorize passages from them he shall be
killed; if he marry his daughter to a Brahmin the husband shall go to
hell for defiling himself by contact with a woman so infinitely his
inferior; and that it is forbidden to a Sudra to acquire wealth. “The
bulk of the population of India,“ says Bucklet–[Population to-day,
300,000,000.] –“is the Sudras–the workers, the farmers, the creators of
wealth.“</p>
<p>Manuel was a failure, poor old fellow. His age was against him. He
was desperately slow and phenomenally forgetful. When he went three
blocks on an errand he would be gone two hours, and then forget what it
was he went for. When he packed a trunk it took him forever, and the
trunk’s contents were an unimaginable chaos when he got done. He
couldn’t wait satisfactorily at table–a prime defect, for if you haven’t
your own servant in an Indian hotel you are likely to have a slow time
of it and go away hungry. We couldn’t understand his English; he
couldn’t understand ours; and when we found that he couldn’t understand
his own, it seemed time for us to part. I had to discharge him; there
was no help for it. But I did it as kindly as I could, and as gently. We
must part, said I, but I hoped we should meet again in a better world.
It was not true, but it was only a little thing to say, and saved his
feelings and cost me nothing.</p>
<p>But now that he was gone, and was off my mind and heart, my spirits
began to rise at once, and I was soon feeling brisk and ready to go out
and have adventures. Then his newly-hired successor flitted in, touched
his forehead, and began to fly around here, there, and everywhere, on
his velvet feet, and in five minutes he had everything in the room
“ship-shape and Bristol fashion,“ as the sailors say, and was standing
at the salute, waiting for orders. Dear me, what a rustler he was after
the slumbrous way of Manuel, poor old slug! All my heart, all my
affection, all my admiration, went out spontaneously to this frisky
little forked black thing, this compact and compressed incarnation of
energy and force and promptness and celerity and confidence, this smart,
smily, engaging, shiney-eyed little devil, feruled on his upper end by a
gleaming fire-coal of a fez with a red-hot tassel dangling from it. I
said, with deep satisfaction–</p>
<p>“You’ll suit. What is your name?“</p>
<p>He reeled it mellowly off.</p>
<p>“Let me see if I can make a selection out of it–for business uses, I
mean; we will keep the rest for Sundays. Give it to me in
installments.“</p>
<p>He did it. But there did not seem to be any short ones, except
Mousawhich suggested mouse. It was out of character; it was too soft,
too quiet, too conservative; it didn’t fit his splendid style. I
considered, and said–</p>
<p>“Mousa is short enough, but I don’t quite like it. It seems colorless
–inharmonious–inadequate; and I am sensitive to such things. How do you
think Satan would do?“</p>
<p>“Yes, master. Satan do wair good.“</p>
<p>It was his way of saying “very good.“</p>
<p>There was a rap at the door. Satan covered the ground with a single
skip; there was a word or two of Hindostani, then he disappeared. Three
minutes later he was before me again, militarily erect, and waiting for
me to speak first.</p>
<p>“What is it, Satan?“</p>
<p>“God want to see you.“</p>
<p>“Who?“</p>
<p>“God. I show him up, master?“</p>
<p>“Why, this is so unusual, that–that–well, you see indeed I am so
unprepared–I don’t quite know what I do mean. Dear me, can’t you
explain? Don’t you see that this is a most ex—-“</p>
<p>“Here his card, master.“</p>
<p>Wasn’t it curious–and amazing, and tremendous, and all that? Such a
personage going around calling on such as I, and sending up his card,
like a mortal–sending it up by Satan. It was a bewildering collision of
the impossibles. But this was the land of the Arabian Nights, this was
India! and what is it that cannot happen in India?</p>
<p>We had the interview. Satan was right–the Visitor was indeed a God in
the conviction of his multitudinous followers, and was worshiped by them
in sincerity and humble adoration. They are troubled by no doubts as to
his divine origin and office. They believe in him, they pray to him,
they make offerings to him, they beg of him remission of sins; to them
his person, together with everything connected with it, is sacred; from
his barber they buy the parings of his nails and set them in gold, and
wear them as precious amulets.</p>
<p>I tried to seem tranquilly conversational and at rest, but I was not.
Would you have been? I was in a suppressed frenzy of excitement and
curiosity and glad wonder. I could not keep my eyes off him. I was
looking upon a god, an actual god, a recognized and accepted god; and
every detail of his person and his dress had a consuming interest for
me. And the thought went floating through my head, “He is
worshiped–think of it–he is not a recipient of the pale homage called
compliment, wherewith the highest human clay must make shift to be
satisfied, but of an infinitely richer spiritual food: adoration,
worship!–men and women lay their cares and their griefs and their broken
hearts at his feet; and he gives them his peace; and they go away
healed.“</p>
<p>And just then the Awful Visitor said, in the simplest way–“There is a
feature of the philosophy of Huck Finn which“–and went luminously on
with the construction of a compact and nicely-discriminated literary
verdict.</p>
<p>It is a land of surprises–India! I had had my ambitions–I had hoped,
and almost expected, to be read by kings and presidents and emperors–but
I had never looked so high as That. It would be false modesty to pretend
that I was not inordinately pleased. I was. I was much more pleased than
I should have been with a compliment from a man.</p>
<p>He remained half an hour, and I found him a most courteous and
charming gentleman. The godship has been in his family a good while, but
I do not know how long. He is a Mohammedan deity; by earthly rank he is
a prince; not an Indian but a Persian prince. He is a direct descendant
of the Prophet’s line. He is comely; also young–for a god; not forty,
perhaps not above thirty-five years old. He wears his immense honors
with tranquil brace, and with a dignity proper to his awful calling. He
speaks English with the ease and purity of a person born to it. I think
I am not overstating this. He was the only god I had ever seen, and I
was very favorably impressed. When he rose to say good-bye, the door
swung open and I caught the flash of a red fez, and heard these words,
reverently said–</p>
