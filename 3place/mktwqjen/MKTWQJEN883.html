<h4 id="letter-vii">LETTER VII</h4>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, 18–. DEAR CHING FOO: I was glad enough when my case
came up. An hour’s experience had made me as tired of the police court
as of the dungeon. I was not uneasy about the result of the trial, but
on the contrary felt that as soon as the large auditory of Americans
present should hear how that the rowdies had set the dogs on me when I
was going peacefully along the street, and how, when I was all torn and
bleeding, the officers arrested me and put me in jail and let the
rowdies go free, the gallant hatred of oppression which is part of the
very flesh and blood of every American would be stirred to its utmost,
and I should be instantly set at liberty. In truth I began to fear for
the other side. There in full view stood the ruffians who had misused
me, and I began to fear that in the first burst of generous anger
occasioned by the revealment of what they had done, they might be
harshly handled, and possibly even banished the country as having
dishonoured her and being no longer worthy to remain upon her sacred
soil.</p>
<p>The official interpreter of the court asked my name, and then spoke
it aloud so that all could hear. Supposing that all was now ready, I
cleared my throat and began–in Chinese, because of my imperfect
English:</p>
<p>“Hear, O high and mighty mandarin, and believe! As I went about my
peaceful business in the street, behold certain men set a dog on me,
and–</p>
<p>“Silence!“</p>
<p>It was the judge that spoke. The interpreter whispered to me that I
must keep perfectly still. He said that no statement would be received
from me–I must only talk through my lawyer.</p>
<p>I had no lawyer. In the early morning a police court lawyer (termed,
in the higher circles of society, a “shyster“) had come into our den in
the prison and offered his services to me, but I had been obliged to go
without them because I could not pay in advance or give security. I told
the interpreter how the matter stood. He said I must take my chances on
the witnesses then. I glanced around, and my failing confidence
revived.</p>
<p>“Call those four Chinamen yonder,“ I said. “They saw it all. I
remember their faces perfectly. They will prove that the white men set
the dog on me when I was not harming them.“</p>
<p>“That won’t work,“ said he. “In this country white men can testify
against Chinamen all they want to, but Chinamen ain’t allowed to testify
against white men!“</p>
<p>What a chill went through me! And then I felt the indignant blood
rise to my cheek at this libel upon the Home of the Oppressed, where all
men are free and equal–perfectly equal–perfectly free and perfectly
equal. I despised this Chinese-speaking Spaniard for his mean slander of
the land that was sheltering and feeding him. I sorely wanted to sear
his eyes with that sentence from the great and good American Declaration
of Independence which we have copied in letters of gold in China and
keep hung up over our family altars and in our temples–I mean the one
about all men being created free and equal.</p>
<p>But woe is me, Ching Foo, the man was right. He was right, after all.
There were my witnesses, but I could not use them. But now came a new
hope. I saw my white friend come in, and I felt that he had come there
purposely to help me. I may almost say I knew it. So I grew easier. He
passed near enough to me to say under his breath, “Don’t be afraid,“ and
then I had no more fear. But presently the rowdies recognised him and
began to scowl at him in no friendly way, and to make threatening signs
at him. The two officers that arrested me fixed their eyes steadily on
his; he bore it well, but gave in presently, and dropped his eyes. They
still gazed at his eyebrows, and every time he raised his eyes he
encountered their winkless stare–until after a minute or two he ceased
to lift his head at all. The judge had been giving some instructions
privately to some one for a little while, but now he was ready to resume
business. Then the trial so unspeakably important to me, and freighted
with such prodigious consequence to my wife and children, began,
progressed, ended, was recorded in the books, noted down by the
newspaper reporters, and forgotten by everybody but me–all in the little
space of two minutes!</p>
<p>“Ah Song Hi, Chinaman. Officers O’Flannigan and O’Flaherty,
witnesses. Come forward, Officer O’Flannigan.“</p>
<p>OFFICER–“He was making a disturbance in Kearny street.“</p>
<p>JUDGE–“Any witnesses on the other side?“ No response. The white
friend raised his eyes encountered Officer O’Flaherty’s–blushed a
little–got up and left the courtroom, avoiding all glances and not
taking his own from the floor.</p>
<p>JUDGE–“Give him five dollars or ten days.“</p>
<p>In my desolation there was a glad surprise in the words; but it
passed away when I found that he only meant that I was to be fined five
dollars or imprisoned ten days longer in default of it.</p>
<p>There were twelve or fifteen Chinamen in our crowd of prisoners,
charged with all manner of little thefts and misdemeanors, and their
cases were quickly disposed of, as a general thing. When the charge came
from a policeman or other white man, he made his statement and that was
the end of it, unless the Chinaman’s lawyer could find some white person
to testify in his client’s behalf, for, neither the accused Chinaman nor
his countrymen being allowed to say anything, the statement of the
officers or other white person was amply sufficient to convict. So, as I
said, the Chinamen’s cases were quickly disposed of, and fines and
imprisonment promptly distributed among them. In one or two of the cases
the charges against Chinamen were brought by Chinamen themselves, and in
those cases Chinamen testified against Chinamen, through the
interpreter; but the fixed rule of the court being that the
preponderance of testimony in such cases should determine the prisoner’s
guilt or innocence, and there being nothing very binding about an oath
administered to the lower orders of our people without the ancient
solemnity of cutting off a chicken’s head and burning some yellow paper
at the same time, the interested parties naturally drum up a cloud of
witnesses who are cheerfully willing to give evidence without ever
knowing anything about the matter in hand. The judge has a custom of
rattling through with as much of this testimony as his patience will
stand, and then shutting off the rest and striking an average.</p>
<p>By noon all the business of the court was finished, and then several
of us who had not fared well were remanded to prison; the judge went
home; the lawyers, and officers, and spectators departed their several
ways, and left the uncomely court-room to silence, solitude, and
Stiggers, the newspaper reporter, which latter would now write up his
items (said an ancient Chinaman to me), in the which he would praise all
the policemen indiscriminately and abuse the Chinamen and dead
people.</p>
