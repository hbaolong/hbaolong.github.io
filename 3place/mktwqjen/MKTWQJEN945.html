<p>DEAR MR. CLEMENS,–You have the thanks of the Association, and the
terms shall be as you say. But why give all of it? Why not reserve a
portion –why should you do this work wholly without compensation? Truly
yours FRED. D. GRANT.</p>
<p>MAJOR GENERAL GRANT, Army Headquarters.</p>
<p>DEAR GENERAL,–Because I stopped talking for pay a good many years
ago, and I could not resume the habit now without a great deal of
personal discomfort. I love to hear myself talk, because I get so much
instruction and moral upheaval out of it, but I lose the bulk of this
joy when I charge for it. Let the terms stand.</p>
<p>General, if I have your approval, I wish to use this good occasion to
retire permanently from the platform. Truly yours S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>DEAR MR. CLEMENS,–Certainly. But as an old friend, permit me to say,
Don’t do that. Why should you?–you are not old yet. Yours truly, FRED D.
GRANT.</p>
<p>DEAR GENERAL,–I mean the pay-platform; I shan’t retire from the
gratis-platform until after I am dead and courtesy requires me to keep
still and not disturb the others.</p>
<p>What shall I talk about? My idea is this: to instruct the audience
about Robert Fulton, and….. Tell me–was that his real name, or was it
his nom de plume? However, never mind, it is not important–I can skip
it, and the house will think I knew all about it, but forgot. Could you
find out for me if he was one of the Signers of the Declaration, and
which one? But if it is any trouble, let it alone, I can skip it. Was he
out with Paul Jones? Will you ask Horace Porter? And ask him if he
brought both of them home. These will be very interesting facts, if they
can be established. But never mind, don’t trouble Porter, I can
establish them anyway. The way I look at it, they are historical
gems–gems of the very first water.</p>
<p>Well, that is my idea, as I have said: first, excite the audience
with a spoonful of information about Fulton, then quiet down with a
barrel of illustration drawn by memory from my books–and if you don’t
say anything the house will think they never heard of it before, because
people don’t really read your books, they only say they do, to keep you
from feeling bad. Next, excite the house with another spoonful of
Fultonian fact, then tranquilize them again with another barrel of
illustration. And so on and so on, all through the evening; and if you
are discreet and don’t tell them the illustrations don’t illustrate
anything, they won’t notice it and I will send them home as
well-informed about Robert Fulton as I am myself. Don’t be afraid; I
know all about audiences, they believe everything you say, except when
you are telling the truth. Truly yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>P.S. Mark all the advertisements “Private and Confidential,“
otherwise the people will not read them. M. T.</p>
<p>DEAR MR. CLEMENS,–How long shall you talk? I ask in order that we may
be able to say when carriages may be called. Very Truly yours, HUGH
GORDON MILLER, Secretary.</p>
<p>DEAR MR. MILLER,–I cannot say for sure. It is my custom to keep on
talking till I get the audience cowed. Sometimes it takes an hour and
fifteen minutes, sometimes I can do it in an hour. Sincerely yours, S.
L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Mem. My charge is 2 boxes free. Not the choicest–sell the choicest,
and give me any 6-seat boxes you please. S. L. C.</p>
<p>I want Fred Grant (in uniform) on the stage; also the rest of the
officials of the Association; also other distinguished people–all the
attractions we can get. Also, a seat for Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine, who
may be useful to me if he is near me and on the front. S. L. C.</p>
<p>The seat chosen for the writer of these notes was to be at the front
of the stage in order that the lecturer might lean over now and then and
pretend to be asking information concerning Fulton. I was not entirely
happy in the thought of this showy honor, and breathed more freely when
this plan was abandoned and the part assigned to General Grant.</p>
<p>The lecture was given in Carnegie Hall, which had been gayly
decorated for the occasion. The house was more than filled, and a great
sum of money was realized for the fund.</p>
<p>It was that spring that Gorky and Tchaikowski, the Russian
revolutionists, came to America hoping to arouse interest in their
cause. The idea of the overthrow of the Russian dynasty was pleasant to
Mark Twain. Few things would have given him greater comfort than to have
known that a little more than ten years would see the downfall of
Russian imperialism. The letter which follows was a reply to an
invitation from Tchaikowski, urging him to speak at one of the
meetings.</p>
<p>DEAR MR. TCHAIKOWSKI,–I thank you for the honor of the invitation,
but I am not able to accept it, because on Thursday evening I shall be
presiding at a meeting whose object is to find remunerative work for
certain classes of our blind who would gladly support themselves if they
had the opportunity.</p>
<p>My sympathies are with the Russian revolution, of course. It goes
without saying. I hope it will succeed, and now that I have talked with
you I take heart to believe it will. Government by falsified promises;
by lies, by treacheries, and by the butcher-knife for the aggrandizement
of a single family of drones and its idle and vicious kin has been borne
quite long enough in Russia, I should think, and it is to be hoped that
the roused nation, now rising in its strength, will presently put an end
to it and set up the republic in its place. Some of us, even of the
white headed, may live to see the blessed day when Czars and Grand Dukes
will be as scarce there as I trust they are in heaven. Most sincerely
yours, MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>There came another summer at Dublin, New Hampshire, this time in the
fine Upton residence on the other slope of Monadnock, a place of equally
beautiful surroundings, and an even more extended view. Clemens was at
this time working steadily on his so-called Autobiography, which was not
that, in fact, but a series of remarkable chapters, reminiscent,
reflective, commentative, written without any particular sequence as to
time or subject-matter. He dictated these chapters to a stenographer,
usually in the open air, sitting in a comfortable rocker or pacing up
and down the long veranda that faced a vast expanse of wooded slope and
lake and distant blue mountains. It became one of the happiest
occupations of his later years.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Maine:</p>
<p>DUBLIN, Sunday, June 17, ’06. DEAR HOWELLS,–….. The dictating goes
lazily and pleasantly on. With intervals. I find that I have been at it,
off and on, nearly two hours a day for 155 days, since Jan. 9. To be
exact I’ve dictated 75 hours in 80 days and loafed 75 days. I’ve added
60,000 words in the month that I’ve been here; which indicates that I’ve
dictated during 20 days of that time–40 hours, at an average of 1,500
words an hour. It’s a plenty, and I am satisfied.</p>
<p>There’s a good deal of “fat“ I’ve dictated, (from Jan. 9) 210,000
words, and the “fat“ adds about 50,000 more.</p>
<p>The “fat“ is old pigeon-holed things, of the years gone by, which I
or editors didn’t das’t to print. For instance, I am dumping in the
little old book which I read to you in Hartford about 30 years ago and
which you said “publish–and ask Dean Stanley to furnish an introduction;
he’ll do it.“ (“Captain Stormfield’s Visit to Heaven.“) It reads quite
to suit me, without altering a word, now that it isn’t to see print
until I am dead.</p>
<p>To-morrow I mean to dictate a chapter which will get my heirs and
assigns burnt alive if they venture to print it this side of 2006
A.D.–which I judge they won’t. There’ll be lots of such chapters if I
live 3 or 4 years longer. The edition of A.D. 2006 will make a stir when
it comes out. I shall be hovering around taking notice, along with other
dead pals. You are invited. MARK.</p>
<p>His tendency to estimate the measure of the work he was doing, and
had completed, must have clung to him from his old printer days.</p>
<p>The chapter which was to get his heirs and assigns burned alive was
on the orthodox God, and there was more than one such chapter. In the
next letter he refers to two exquisite poems by Howells, and the writer
of these notes recalls his wonderful reading of them aloud. ‘In Our
Town’ was a collection of short stories then recently issued by William
Allen White. Howells had recommended them.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Maine:</p>
<p>21 FIFTH AVE., Tuesday Eve. DEAR HOWELLS,–It is lovely of you to say
those beautiful things–I don’t know how to thank you enough. But I love
you, that I know.</p>
<p>I read “After the Wedding“ aloud and we felt all the pain of it and
the truth. It was very moving and very beautiful–would have been
over-comingly moving, at times, but for the haltings and pauses
compelled by the difficulties of MS–these were a protection, in that
they furnished me time to brace up my voice, and get a new start. Jean
wanted to keep the MS for another reading-aloud, and for “keeps,“ too, I
suspected, but I said it would be safest to write you about it.</p>
<p>I like “In Our Town,“ particularly that Colonel, of the Lookout
Mountain Oration, and very particularly pages 212-16. I wrote and told
White so.</p>
<p>After “After the Wedding“ I read “The Mother“ aloud and sounded its
human deeps with your deep-sea lead. I had not read it before, since it
was first published.</p>
<p>I have been dictating some fearful things, for 4 successive
mornings–for no eye but yours to see until I have been dead a century–if
then. But I got them out of my system, where they had been festering for
years–and that was the main thing. I feel better, now.</p>
<p>I came down today on business–from house to house in 12 1/2 hours,
and expected to arrive dead, but am neither tired nor sleepy. Yours as
always MARK.</p>
<p>To William Allen White, in Emporia, Kans.:</p>
<p>DUBLIN, NEW HAMPSHIRE, June 24, 1906. DEAR MR. WHITE,–Howells told me
that “In Our Town“ was a charming book, and indeed it is. All of it is
delightful when read one’s self, parts of it can score finely when
subjected to the most exacting of tests–the reading aloud. Pages 197 and
216 are of that grade. I have tried them a couple of times on the
family, and pages 212 and 216 are qualified to fetch any house of any
country, caste or color, endowed with those riches which are denied to
no nation on the planet–humor and feeling.</p>
<p>Talk again–the country is listening. Sincerely yours, S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Witter Bynner, the poet, was one of the editors of McClure’s Magazine
at this time, but was trying to muster the courage to give up routine
work for verse-making and the possibility of poverty. Clemens was fond
of Bynner and believed in his work. He did not advise him, however, to
break away entirely from a salaried position–at least not immediately;
but one day Bynner did so, and reported the step he had taken, with some
doubt as to the answer he would receive.</p>
<p>To Witter Bynner, in New York:</p>
<p>DUBLIN, Oct. 5, 1906. DEAR POET,–You have certainly done right for
several good reasons; at least, of them, I can name two:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>With your reputation you can have your freedom and yet earn your
living. 2. if you fall short of succeeding to your wish, your reputation
will provide you another job. And so in high approval I suppress the
scolding and give you the saintly and fatherly pat instead. MARK
TWAIN.</li>
</ol>
<p>On another occasion, when Bynner had written a poem to Clara Clemens,
her father pretended great indignation that the first poem written by
Bynner to any one in his household should not be to him, and threatened
revenge. At dinner shortly after he produced from his pocket a slip of
paper on which he had set down what he said was “his only poem.“ He read
the lines that follow:</p>
<p>“Of all sad words of tongue or pen, The saddest are these: It might
have been. Ah, say not so! as life grows longer, leaner, thinner, We
recognize, O God, it might have Bynner!“</p>
<p>He returned to New York in October and soon after was presented by
Mrs. H. H. Rogers with a handsome billiard-table.</p>
<p>He had a passion for the game, but had played comparatively little
since the old Hartford days of fifteen years before, when a group of his
friends used to assemble on Friday nights in the room at the top of the
house for long, strenuous games and much hilarity. Now the old fever all
came back; the fascinations of the game superseded even his interest in
the daily dictations.</p>
<p>To Mrs. H. H. Rogers, in New York:</p>
<p>21 FIFTH AVENUE, Monday, Nov., 1906. DEAR MRS. ROGERS,–The billiard
table is better than the doctors. It is driving out the heartburn in a
most promising way. I have a billiardist on the premises, and I walk not
less than ten miles every day with the cue in my hand. And the walking
is not the whole of the exercise, nor the most health-giving part of it,
I think. Through the multitude of the positions and attitudes it brings
into play every muscle in the body and exercises them all.</p>
<p>The games begin right after luncheon, daily, and continue until
midnight, with 2 hours’ intermission for dinner and music. And so it is
9 hours’ exercise per day, and 10 or 12 on Sunday. Yesterday and last
night it was 12–and I slept until 8 this morning without waking. The
billiard table, as a Sabbath breaker can beat any coal-breaker in
Pennsylvania, and give it 30 in, the game. If Mr. Rogers will take to
daily billiards he can do without doctors and the massageur, I
think.</p>
<p>We are really going to build a house on my farm, an hour and a half
from New York. It is decided. It is to be built by contract, and is to
come within 5,000. With love and many thanks. S. L. C.</p>
<p>P.S. Clara is in the sanitarium–till January 28 when her western
concert tour will begin. She is getting to be a mighty competent singer.
You must know Clara better; she is one of the very finest and completest
and most satisfactory characters I have ever met. Others knew it before,
but I have always been busy with other matters.</p>
<p>The “billiardist on the premises“ was the writer of these notes, who,
earlier in the year, had become his biographer, and, in the course of
time, his daily companion and friend. The farm mentioned was one which
he had bought at Redding, Connecticut, where, later, he built the house
known as “Stormfield.“</p>
<p>Henry Mills Alden, for nearly forty years editor of Harper’s
Magazine, arrived at his seventieth birthday on November 11th that year,
and Harper andandandand Brothers had arranged to give him a great dinner
in the offices of Franklin Square, where, for half a century, he had
been an active force. Mark Twain, threatened with a cold, and knowing
the dinner would be strenuous, did not feel able to attend, so wrote a
letter which, if found suitable, could be read at the gathering.</p>
<p>To Mr. Henry Alden:</p>
<p>ALDEN,–dear and ancient friend–it is a solemn moment. You have now
reached the age of discretion. You have been a long time arriving. Many
years ago you docked me on an article because the subject was too old;
later, you docked me on an article because the subject was too new;
later still, you docked me on an article because the subject was betwixt
and between. Once, when I wrote a Letter to Queen Victoria, you did not
put it in the respectable part of the Magazine, but interred it in that
potter’s field, the Editor’s Drawer. As a result, she never answered it.
How often we recall, with regret, that Napoleon once shot at a magazine
editor and missed him and killed a publisher. But we remember, with
charity, that his intentions were good.</p>
<p>You will reform, now, Alden. You will cease from these economies, and
you will be discharged. But in your retirement you will carry with you
the admiration and earnest good wishes of the oppressed and toiling
scribes. This will be better than bread. Let this console you when the
bread fails.</p>
<p>You will carry with you another thing, too–the affection of the
scribes; for they all love you in spite of your crimes. For you bear a
kind heart in your breast, and the sweet and winning spirit that charms
away all hostilities and animosities, and makes of your enemy your
friend and keeps him so. You have reigned over us thirty-six years, and,
please God, you shall reign another thirty-six–“and peace to Mahmoud on
his golden throne!“ Always yours MARK</p>
<p>A copyright bill was coming up in Washington and a delegation of
authors went down to work for it. Clemens was not the head of the
delegation, but he was the most prominent member of it, as well as the
most useful. He invited the writer to accompany him, and elsewhere I
have told in detail the story of that excursion,–[See Mark Twain; A
Biography, chap. ccli,]–which need be but briefly touched upon here.</p>
<p>His work was mainly done aside from that of the delegation. They had
him scheduled for a speech, however, which he made without notes and
with scarcely any preparation. Meantime he had applied to Speaker Cannon
for permission to allow him on the floor of the House, where he could
buttonhole the Congressmen. He was not eligible to the floor without
having received the thanks of Congress, hence the following letter:</p>
<p>To Hon. Joseph Cannon, House of Representatives:</p>
<p>Dec. 7, 1906. DEAR UNCLE JOSEPH,–Please get me the thanks of the
Congress–not next week but right away. It is very necessary. Do
accomplish this for your affectionate old friend right away; by
persuasion, if you can, by violence if you must, for it is imperatively
necessary that I get on the floor for two or three hours and talk to the
members, man by man, in behalf of the support, encouragement and
protection of one of the nation’s most valuable assets and
industries–its literature. I have arguments with me, also a barrel, with
liquid in it.</p>
<p>Give me a chance. Get me the thanks of Congress. Don’t wait for
others; there isn’t time. I have stayed away and let Congress alone for
seventy-one years and I am entitled to thanks. Congress knows it
perfectly well and I have long felt hurt that this quite proper and
earned expression of gratitude has been merely felt by the House and
never publicly uttered. Send me an order on the Sergeant-at-Arms quick.
When shall I come? With love and a benediction. MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>This was mainly a joke. Mark Twain did not expect any “thanks,“ but
he did hope for access to the floor, which once, in an earlier day, had
been accorded him. We drove to the Capitol and he delivered his letter
to “Uncle Joe“ by hand. “Uncle Joe“ could not give him the privilege of
the floor; the rules had become more stringent. He declared they would
hang him if he did such a thing. He added that he had a private room
down-stairs, where Mark Twain might establish headquarters, and that he
would assign his colored servant, Neal, of long acquaintanceship with
many of the members, to pass the word that Mark Twain was receiving.</p>
<p>The result was a great success. All that afternoon members of
Congress poured into the Speaker’s room and, in an atmosphere blue with
tobacco smoke, Mark Twain talked the gospel of copyright to his heart’s
content.</p>
<p>The bill did not come up for passage that session, but Mark Twain
lived to see his afternoon’s lobbying bring a return. In 1909, Champ
Clark, and those others who had gathered around him that afternoon,
passed a measure that added fourteen years to the copyright term.</p>
<p>The next letter refers to a proposed lobby of quite a different
sort.</p>
<p>To Helen Keller, in Wrentham, Mass.:</p>
<p>21 FIFTH AVENUE, Dec. 23, ’06. DEAR HELEN KELLER,–. . . You say, “As
a reformer, you know that ideas must be driven home again and
again.“</p>
<p>Yes, I know it; and by old experience I know that speeches and
documents and public meetings are a pretty poor and lame way of
accomplishing it. Last year I proposed a sane way–one which I had
practiced with success for a quarter of a century–but I wasn’t expecting
it to get any attention, and it didn’t.</p>
<p>Give me a battalion of 200 winsome young girls and matrons, and let
me tell them what to do and how to do it, and I will be responsible for
shining results. If I could mass them on the stage in front of the
audience and instruct them there, I could make a public meeting take
hold of itself and do something really valuable for once. Not that the
real instruction would be done there, for it wouldn’t; it would be
previously done privately, and merely repeated there.</p>
<p>But it isn’t going to happen–the good old way will be stuck to:
there’ll be a public meeting: with music, and prayer, and a wearying
report, and a verbal description of the marvels the blind can do, and 17
speeches–then the call upon all present who are still alive, to
contribute. This hoary program was invented in the idiot asylum, and
will never be changed. Its function is to breed hostility to good
causes.</p>
<p>Some day somebody will recruit my 200–my dear beguilesome Knights of
the Golden Fleece–and you will see them make good their ominous
name.</p>
<p>Mind, we must meet! not in the grim and ghastly air of the platform,
mayhap, but by the friendly fire–here at 21. Affectionately your friend,
S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>They did meet somewhat later that winter in the friendly parlors of
No. 21, and friends gathered in to meet the marvelous blind girl and to
pay tribute to Miss Sullivan (Mrs. Macy) for her almost incredible
achievement.</p>
