<h4 id="chapter-xviii.">CHAPTER XVIII.</h4>
<p>At eight in the morning we reached the remnant and ruin of what had
been the important military station of “Camp Floyd,“ some forty-five or
fifty miles from Salt Lake City. At four P.M. we had doubled our
distance and were ninety or a hundred miles from Salt Lake. And now we
entered upon one of that species of deserts whose concentrated
hideousness shames the diffused and diluted horrors of Sahara–an
“alkali“ desert. For sixty-eight miles there was but one break in it. I
do not remember that this was really a break; indeed it seems to me that
it was nothing but a watering depot in the midst of the stretch of
sixty-eight miles. If my memory serves me, there was no well or spring
at this place, but the water was hauled there by mule and ox teams from
the further side of the desert. There was a stage station there. It was
forty-five miles from the beginning of the desert, and twenty-three from
the end of it.</p>
<p>We plowed and dragged and groped along, the whole live-long night,
and at the end of this uncomfortable twelve hours we finished the
forty-five-mile part of the desert and got to the stage station where
the imported water was. The sun was just rising. It was easy enough to
cross a desert in the night while we were asleep; and it was pleasant to
reflect, in the morning, that we in actual person had encountered an
absolute desert and could always speak knowingly of deserts in presence
of the ignorant thenceforward. And it was pleasant also to reflect that
this was not an obscure, back country desert, but a very celebrated one,
the metropolis itself, as you may say. All this was very well and very
comfortable and satisfactory–but now we were to cross a desert in
daylight. This was fine–novel–romantic–dramatically adventurous –this,
indeed, was worth living for, worth traveling for! We would write home
all about it.</p>
<p>This enthusiasm, this stern thirst for adventure, wilted under the
sultry August sun and did not last above one hour. One poor little
hour–and then we were ashamed that we had “gushed“ so. The poetry was
all in the anticipation–there is none in the reality. Imagine a vast,
waveless ocean stricken dead and turned to ashes; imagine this solemn
waste tufted with ash-dusted sage-bushes; imagine the lifeless silence
and solitude that belong to such a place; imagine a coach, creeping like
a bug through the midst of this shoreless level, and sending up tumbled
volumes of dust as if it were a bug that went by steam; imagine this
aching monotony of toiling and plowing kept up hour after hour, and the
shore still as far away as ever, apparently; imagine team, driver, coach
and passengers so deeply coated with ashes that they are all one
colorless color; imagine ash-drifts roosting above moustaches and
eyebrows like snow accumulations on boughs and bushes. This is the
reality of it.</p>
<p>The sun beats down with dead, blistering, relentless malignity; the
perspiration is welling from every pore in man and beast, but scarcely a
sign of it finds its way to the surface–it is absorbed before it gets
there; there is not the faintest breath of air stirring; there is not a
merciful shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament; there is not a
living creature visible in any direction whither one searches the blank
level that stretches its monotonous miles on every hand; there is not a
sound–not a sigh–not a whisper–not a buzz, or a whir of wings, or
distant pipe of bird–not even a sob from the lost souls that doubtless
people that dead air. And so the occasional sneezing of the resting
mules, and the champing of the bits, grate harshly on the grim
stillness, not dissipating the spell but accenting it and making one
feel more lonesome and forsaken than before.</p>
<p>The mules, under violent swearing, coaxing and whip-cracking, would
make at stated intervals a “spurt,“ and drag the coach a hundred or may
be two hundred yards, stirring up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled
back, enveloping the vehicle to the wheel-tops or higher, and making it
seem afloat in a fog. Then a rest followed, with the usual sneezing and
bit-champing. Then another “spurt“ of a hundred yards and another rest
at the end of it. All day long we kept this up, without water for the
mules and without ever changing the team. At least we kept it up ten
hours, which, I take it, is a day, and a pretty honest one, in an alkali
desert. It was from four in the morning till two in the afternoon. And
it was so hot! and so close! and our water canteens went dry in the
middle of the day and we got so thirsty! It was so stupid and tiresome
and dull! and the tedious hours did lag and drag and limp along with
such a cruel deliberation! It was so trying to give one’s watch a good
long undisturbed spell and then take it out and find that it had been
fooling away the time and not trying to get ahead any! The alkali dust
cut through our lips, it persecuted our eyes, it ate through the
delicate membranes and made our noses bleed and kept them bleeding–and
truly and seriously the romance all faded far away and disappeared, and
left the desert trip nothing but a harsh reality–a thirsty, sweltering,
longing, hateful reality!</p>
<p>Two miles and a quarter an hour for ten hours–that was what we
accomplished. It was hard to bring the comprehension away down to such a
snail-pace as that, when we had been used to making eight and ten miles
an hour. When we reached the station on the farther verge of the desert,
we were glad, for the first time, that the dictionary was along, because
we never could have found language to tell how glad we were, in any sort
of dictionary but an unabridged one with pictures in it. But there could
not have been found in a whole library of dictionaries language
sufficient to tell how tired those mules were after their twenty-three
mile pull. To try to give the reader an idea of how thirsty they were,
would be to “gild refined gold or paint the lily.“</p>
<p>Somehow, now that it is there, the quotation does not seem to fit–but
no matter, let it stay, anyhow. I think it is a graceful and attractive
thing, and therefore have tried time and time again to work it in where
it would fit, but could not succeed. These efforts have kept my mind
distracted and ill at ease, and made my narrative seem broken and
disjointed, in places. Under these circumstances it seems to me best to
leave it in, as above, since this will afford at least a temporary
respite from the wear and tear of trying to “lead up“ to this really apt
and beautiful quotation.</p>
