1890, CHIEFLY TO JOS. T. GOODMAN. THE GREAT MACHINE ENTERPRISE</h4>
<p>Dr. John Brown’s son, whom Mark Twain and his wife had known in 1873
as “Jock,“ sent copies of Dr. John Brown and His Sister Isabella, by E.
T. McLaren. It was a gift appreciated in the Clemens home.</p>
<p>To Mr. John Brown, in Edinburgh, Scotland:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Feby 11, 1890. DEAR MR. BROWN,–Both copies came, and we are
reading and re-reading the one, and lending the other, to old time
adorers of “Rab and his Friends.“ It is an exquisite book; the
perfection of literary workmanship. It says in every line, “Don’t look
at me, look at him“–and one tries to be good and obey; but the charm of
the painter is so strong that one can’t keep his entire attention on the
developing portrait, but must steal side-glimpses of the artist, and try
to divine the trick of her felicitous brush. In this book the doctor
lives and moves just as he was. He was the most extensive slave-holder
of his time, and the kindest; and yet he died without setting one of his
bondmen free. We all send our very, very kindest regards. Sincerely
yours S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>If Mark Twain had been less interested in the type-setting machine he
might possibly have found a profit that winter in the old Sellers play,
which he had written with Howells seven years before. The play had
eventually been produced at the Lyceum Theatre in New York, with A. P.
Burbank in the leading role, and Clemens and Howells as financial
backers. But it was a losing investment, nor did it pay any better when
Clemens finally sent Burbank with it on the road. Now, however, James A.
Herne, a well-known actor and playwright, became interested in the idea,
after a discussion of the matter with Howells, and there seemed a
probability that with changes made under Herne’s advisement the play
might be made sensible and successful.</p>
<p>But Mark Twain’s greater interest was now all in the type-machine,
and certainly he had no money to put into any other venture. His next
letter to Goodman is illuminating–the urgency of his need for funds
opposed to that conscientiousness which was one of the most positive
forces of Mark Twain’s body spiritual. The Mr. Arnot of this letter was
an Elmira capitalist.</p>
<p>To Jos. T. Goodman, in California:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, March 31, ’90. DEAR JOE,–If you were here, I should say,
“Get you to Washington and beg Senator Jones to take the chances and put
up about ten or “–no, I wouldn’t. The money would burn a hole in my
pocket and get away from me if the furnisher of it were proceeding upon
merely your judgment and mine and without other evidence. It is too much
of a responsibility.</p>
<p>But I am in as close a place to-day as ever I was; ,000 due for the
last month’s machine-expenses, and the purse empty. I notified Mr. Arnot
a month ago that I should want ,000 to-day, and his check arrived last
night; but I sent it back to him, because when he bought of me on the
9th of December I said that I would not draw upon him for 3 months, and
that before that date Senator Jones would have examined the machine and
approved, or done the other thing. If Jones should arrive here a week or
ten days from now (as he expects to do,) and should not approve, and
shouldn’t buy any royalties, my deal with Arnot would not be
symmetrically square, and then how could I refund? The surest way was to
return his check.</p>
<p>I have talked with the madam, and here is the result. I will go down
to the factory and notify Paige that I will scrape together ,000 to meet
the March and April expenses, and will retire on the 30th of April and
return the assignment to him if in the meantime I have not found
financial relief.</p>
<p>It is very rough; for the machine does at last seem perfect, and just
a bird to go! I think she’s going to be good for 8,000 ems an hour in
the hands of a good ordinary man after a solid year’s practice. I may be
in error, but I most solidly believe it.</p>
<p>There’s an improved Mergenthaler in New York; Paige and Davis and I
watched it two whole afternoons. With the love of us all, MARK.</p>
<p>Arnot wrote Clemens urging him to accept the check for five thousand
dollars in this moment of need. Clemens was probably as sorely tempted
to compromise with his conscience as he had ever been in his life, but
his resolution field firm.</p>
<p>To M. H. Arnot, in Elmira, N. Y.:</p>
<p>MR. M. H. ARNOT</p>
<p>DEAR SIR,–No–no, I could not think of taking it, with you
unsatisfied; and you ought not to be satisfied until you have made
personal examination of the machine and had a consensus of testimony of
disinterested people, besides. My own perfect knowledge of what is
required of such a machine, and my perfect knowledge of the fact that
this is the only machine that can meet that requirement, make it
difficult for me to realize that a doubt is possible to less well-posted
men; and so I would have taken your money without thinking, and thus
would have done a great wrong to you and a great one to myself. And now
that I go back over the ground, I remember that where I said I could get
along 3 months without drawing on you, that delay contemplated a visit
from you to the machine in the interval, and your satisfaction with its
character and prospects. I had forgotten all that. But I remember it
now; and the fact that it was not “so nominated in the bond“ does not
alter the case or justify me in making my call so prematurely. I do not
know that you regarded all that as a part of the bargain–for you were
thoroughly and magnanimously unexacting–but I so regarded it,
notwithstanding I have so easily managed to forget all about it.</p>
<p>You so gratified me, and did me so much honor in bonding yourself to
me in a large sum, upon no evidence but my word and with no protection
but my honor, that my pride in that is much stronger than my desire to
reap a money advantage from it.</p>
<p>With the sincerest appreciation I am Truly yours S L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>P. S. I have written a good many words and yet I seem to have failed
to say the main thing in exact enough language–which is, that the
transaction between us is not complete and binding until you shall have
convinced yourself that the machine’s character and prospects are
satisfactory.</p>
<p>I ought to explain that the grippe delayed us some weeks, and that we
have since been waiting for Mr. Jones. When he was ready, we were not;
and now we have been ready more than a month, while he has been kept in
Washington by the Silver bill. He said the other day that to venture out
of the Capitol for a day at this time could easily chance to hurt him if
the bill came up for action, meantime, although it couldn’t hurt the
bill, which would pass anyway. Mrs. Jones said she would send me two or
three days’ notice, right after the passage of the bill, and that they
would follow as soon as I should return word that their coming would not
inconvenience us. I suppose I ought to go to New York without waiting
for Mr. Jones, but it would not be wise to go there without money.</p>
<p>The bill is still pending.</p>
<p>The Mergenthaler machine, like the Paige, was also at this time in
the middle stages of experimental development. It was a slower machine,
but it was simpler, less expensive, occupied less room. There was not so
much about it to get out of order; it was not so delicate, not so human.
These were immense advantages.</p>
<p>But no one at this time could say with certainty which typesetter
would reap the harvest of millions. It was only sure that at least one
of them would, and the Mergenthaler people were willing to trade stock
for stock with the Paige company in order to insure financial success
for both, whichever won. Clemens, with a faith that never faltered,
declined this offer, a decision that was to cost him millions.</p>
<p>Winter and spring had gone and summer had come, but still there had
been no financial conclusion with Jones, Mackay, and the other rich
Californians who were to put up the necessary million for the machine’s
manufacture. Goodman was spending a large part of his time traveling
back and forth between California and Washington, trying to keep
business going at both ends. Paige spent most of his time working out
improvements for the type-setter, delicate attachments which complicated
its construction more and more.</p>
<p>To Joe T. Goodman, in Washington:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, June 22, ’90. DEAR JOE,–I have been sitting by the machine
2 hours, this afternoon, and my admiration of it towers higher than
ever. There is no sort of mistake about it, it is the Big Bonanza. In
the 2 hours, the time lost by type-breakage was 3 minutes.</p>
<p>This machine is totally without a rival. Rivalry with it is
impossible. Last Friday, Fred Whitmore (it was the 28th day of his
apprenticeship on the machine) stacked up 49,700 ems of solid nonpareil
in 8 hours, and the type-breaking delay was only 6 minutes for the
day.</p>
<p>I claim yet, as I have always claimed, that the machine’s market
(abroad and here together,) is today worth 50,000,000 without saying
anything about the doubling and trebling of this sum that will follow
within the life of the patents. Now here is a queer fact: I am one of
the wealthiest grandees in America–one of the Vanderbilt gang, in
fact–and yet if you asked me to lend you a couple of dollars I should
have to ask you to take my note instead.</p>
<p>It makes me cheerful to sit by the machine: come up with Mrs. Goodman
and refresh yourself with a draught of the same. Ys ever MARK.</p>
<p>The machine was still breaking the types now and then, and no doubt
Paige was itching to take it to pieces, and only restrained by force
from doing so. He was never thoroughly happy unless he was taking the
machine apart or setting it up again. Finally, he was allowed to go at
it–a disasterous permission, for it was just then that Jones decided to
steal a day or two from the Silver Bill and watch the type-setter in
operation. Paige already had it in parts when this word came from
Goodman, and Jones’s visit had to be called off. His enthusiasm would
seem to have weakened from that day. In July, Goodman wrote that both
Mackay and Jones had become somewhat diffident in the matter of huge
capitalization. He thought it partly due, at least, to “the fatal delays
that have sicklied over the bloom of original enthusiasm.“ Clemens
himself went down to Washington and perhaps warmed Jones with his
eloquence; at least, Jones seemed to have agreed to make some effort in
the matter a qualified promise, the careful word of a wary politician
and capitalist. How many Washington trips were made is not certain, but
certainly more than one. Jones would seem to have suggested forms of
contracts, but if he came to the point of signing any there is no
evidence of it to-day.</p>
<p>Any one who has read Mark Twain’s, “A Connecticut Yankee in King
Arthur’s Court,“ has a pretty good idea of his opinion of kings in
general, and tyrants in particular. Rule by “divine right,“ however
liberal, was distasteful to him; where it meant oppression it stirred
him to violence. In his article, “The Czar’s Soliloquy,“ he gave himself
loose rein concerning atrocities charged to the master of Russia, and in
a letter which he wrote during the summer of 1890, he offered a hint as
to remedies. The letter was written by editorial request, but was never
mailed. Perhaps it seemed too openly revolutionary at the moment.</p>
<p>Yet scarcely more than a quarter of a century was needed to make it
“timely.“ Clemens and his family were spending some weeks in the
Catskills when it was written.</p>
<p>An unpublished letter on the Czar.</p>
<p>ONTEORA, 1890. TO THE EDITOR OF FREE RUSSIA,–I thank you for the
compliment of your invitation to say something, but when I ponder the
bottom paragraph on your first page, and then study your statement on
your third page, of the objects of the several Russian
liberation-parties, I do not quite know how to proceed. Let me quote
here the paragraph referred to:</p>
<p>“But men’s hearts are so made that the sight of one voluntary victim
for a noble idea stirs them more deeply than the sight of a crowd
submitting to a dire fate they cannot escape. Besides, foreigners could
not see so clearly as the Russians how much the Government was
responsible for the grinding poverty of the masses; nor could they very
well realize the moral wretchedness imposed by that Government upon the
whole of educated Russia. But the atrocities committed upon the
defenceless prisoners are there in all their baseness, concrete and
palpable, admitting of no excuse, no doubt or hesitation, crying out to
the heart of humanity against Russian tyranny. And the Tzar’s
Government, stupidly confident in its apparently unassailable position,
instead of taking warning from the first rebukes, seems to mock this
humanitarian age by the aggravation of brutalities. Not satisfied with
slowly killing its prisoners, and with burying the flower of our young
generation in the Siberian desserts, the Government of Alexander III.
resolved to break their spirit by deliberately submitting them to a
regime of unheard-of brutality and degradation.“</p>
<p>When one reads that paragraph in the glare of George Kennan’s
revelations, and considers how much it means; considers that all earthly
figures fail to typify the Czar’s government, and that one must descend
into hell to find its counterpart, one turns hopefully to your statement
of the objects of the several liberation-parties–and is disappointed.
Apparently none of them can bear to think of losing the present hell
entirely, they merely want the temperature cooled down a little.</p>
<p>I now perceive why all men are the deadly and uncompromising enemies
of the rattlesnake: it is merely because the rattlesnake has not speech.
Monarchy has speech, and by it has been able to persuade men that it
differs somehow from the rattlesnake, has something valuable about it
somewhere, something worth preserving, something even good and high and
fine, when properly “modified,“ something entitling it to protection
from the club of the first comer who catches it out of its hole. It
seems a most strange delusion and not reconcilable with our superstition
that man is a reasoning being. If a house is afire, we reason
confidently that it is the first comer’s plain duty to put the fire out
in any way he can –drown it with water, blow it up with dynamite, use
any and all means to stop the spread of the fire and save the rest of
the city. What is the Czar of Russia but a house afire in the midst of a
city of eighty millions of inhabitants? Yet instead of extinguishing
him, together with his nest and system, the liberation-parties are all
anxious to merely cool him down a little and keep him.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this is illogical–idiotic, in fact. Suppose you
had this granite-hearted, bloody-jawed maniac of Russia loose in your
house, chasing the helpless women and little children–your own. What
would you do with him, supposing you had a shotgun? Well, he is loose in
your house-Russia. And with your shotgun in your hand, you stand trying
to think up ways to “modify“ him.</p>
<p>Do these liberation-parties think that they can succeed in a project
which has been attempted a million times in the history of the world and
has never in one single instance been successful–the “modification“ of a
despotism by other means than bloodshed? They seem to think they can. My
privilege to write these sanguinary sentences in soft security was
bought for me by rivers of blood poured upon many fields, in many lands,
but I possess not one single little paltry right or privilege that come
to me as a result of petition, persuasion, agitation for reform, or any
kindred method of procedure. When we consider that not even the most
responsible English monarch ever yielded back a stolen public right
until it was wrenched from them by bloody violence, is it rational to
suppose that gentler methods can win privileges in Russia?</p>
<p>Of course I know that the properest way to demolish the Russian
throne would be by revolution. But it is not possible to get up a
revolution there; so the only thing left to do, apparently, is to keep
the throne vacant by dynamite until a day when candidates shall decline
with thanks. Then organize the Republic. And on the whole this method
has some large advantages; for whereas a revolution destroys some lives
which cannot well be spared, the dynamite way doesn’t. Consider this:
the conspirators against the Czar’s life are caught in every rank of
life, from the low to the high. And consider: if so many take an active
part, where the peril is so dire, is this not evidence that the
sympathizers who keep still and do not show their hands, are countless
for multitudes? Can you break the hearts of thousands of families with
the awful Siberian exodus every year for generations and not eventually
cover all Russia from limit to limit with bereaved fathers and mothers
and brothers and sisters who secretly hate the perpetrator of this
prodigious crime and hunger and thirst for his life? Do you not believe
that if your wife or your child or your father was exiled to the mines
of Siberia for some trivial utterances wrung from a smarting spirit by
the Czar’s intolerable tyranny, and you got a chance to kill him and did
not do it, that you would always be ashamed to be in your own society
the rest of your life? Suppose that that refined and lovely Russian lady
who was lately stripped bare before a brutal soldiery and whipped to
death by the Czar’s hand in the person of the Czar’s creature had been
your wife, or your daughter or your sister, and to-day the Czar should
pass within reach of your hand, how would you feel–and what would you
do? Consider, that all over vast Russia, from boundary to boundary, a
myriad of eyes filled with tears when that piteous news came, and
through those tears that myriad of eyes saw, not that poor lady, but
lost darlings of their own whose fate her fate brought back with new
access of grief out of a black and bitter past never to be forgotten or
forgiven.</p>
<p>If I am a Swinburnian–and clear to the marrow I am–I hold human
nature in sufficient honor to believe there are eighty million mute
Russians that are of the same stripe, and only one Russian family that
isn’t.</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>Type-setter matters were going badly. Clemens still had faith in
Jones, and he had lost no grain of faith in the machine. The money
situation, however, was troublesome. With an expensive establishment,
and work of one sort or another still to be done on the machine, his
income would not reach. Perhaps Goodman had already given up hope, for
he does not seem to have returned from California after the next letter
was written–a colorless letter –in which we feel a note of resignation.
The last few lines are sufficient.</p>
<p>To Joe T. Goodman, in California:</p>
<p>DEAR JOE,–…… I wish you could get a day off and make those two or
three Californians buy those privileges, for I’m going to need money
before long.</p>
<p>I don’t know where the Senator is; but out on the Coast I reckon.</p>
<p>I guess we’ve got a perfect machine at last. We never break a type,
now, and the new device for enabling the operator to touch the last
letters and justify the line simultaneously works, to a charm. With love
to you both, MARK</p>
<p>The year closed gloomily enough. The type-setter seemed to be
perfected, but capital for its manufacture was not forthcoming. The
publishing business of Charles L. Webster andandandand Co. was returning
little or no profit. Clemens’s mother had died in Keokuk at the end of
October, and his wife’s mother, in Elmira a month later. Mark Twain,
writing a short business letter to his publishing manager, Fred J. Ball,
closed it: “Merry Xmas to you!–and I wish to God I could have one myself
before I die.“</p>
