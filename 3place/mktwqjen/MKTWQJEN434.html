<h4 id="chapter-51-reminiscences">Chapter 51 Reminiscences</h4>
<p>WE left for St. Louis in the ‘City of Baton Rouge,’ on a delightfully
hot day, but with the main purpose of my visit but lamely accomplished.
I had hoped to hunt up and talk with a hundred steamboatmen, but got so
pleasantly involved in the social life of the town that I got nothing
more than mere five-minute talks with a couple of dozen of the
craft.</p>
<p>I was on the bench of the pilot-house when we backed out and
‘straightened up’ for the start–the boat pausing for a ‘good ready,’ in
the old-fashioned way, and the black smoke piling out of the chimneys
equally in the old-fashioned way. Then we began to gather momentum, and
presently were fairly under way and booming along. It was all as natural
and familiar–and so were the shoreward sights–as if there had been no
break in my river life. There was a ‘cub,’ and I judged that he would
take the wheel now; and he did. Captain Bixby stepped into the pilot-
house. Presently the cub closed up on the rank of steamships. He made me
nervous, for he allowed too much water to show between our boat and the
ships. I knew quite well what was going to happen, because I could date
back in my own life and inspect the record. The captain looked on,
during a silent half-minute, then took the wheel himself, and crowded
the boat in, till she went scraping along within a hand-breadth of the
ships. It was exactly the favor which he had done me, about a quarter of
a century before, in that same spot, the first time I ever steamed out
of the port of New Orleans. It was a very great and sincere pleasure to
me to see the thing repeated–with somebody else as victim.</p>
<p>We made Natchez (three hundred miles) in twenty-two hours and a half–
much the swiftest passage I have ever made over that piece of water.</p>
<p>The next morning I came on with the four o’clock watch, and saw
Ritchie successfully run half a dozen crossings in a fog, using for his
guidance the marked chart devised and patented by Bixby and himself.
This sufficiently evidenced the great value of the chart.</p>
<p>By and by, when the fog began to clear off, I noticed that the
reflection of a tree in the smooth water of an overflowed bank, six
hundred yards away, was stronger and blacker than the ghostly tree
itself. The faint spectral trees, dimly glimpsed through the shredding
fog, were very pretty things to see.</p>
<p>We had a heavy thunder-storm at Natchez, another at Vicksburg, and
still another about fifty miles below Memphis. They had an old-fashioned
energy which had long been unfamiliar to me. This third storm was
accompanied by a raging wind. We tied up to the bank when we saw the
tempest coming, and everybody left the pilot-house but me. The wind bent
the young trees down, exposing the pale underside of the leaves; and
gust after gust followed, in quick succession, thrashing the branches
violently up and down, and to this side and that, and creating swift
waves of alternating green and white according to the side of the leaf
that was exposed, and these waves raced after each other as do their
kind over a wind-tossed field of oats. No color that was visible
anywhere was quite natural–all tints were charged with a leaden tinge
from the solid cloud-bank overhead. The river was leaden; all distances
the same; and even the far-reaching ranks of combing white-caps were
dully shaded by the dark, rich atmosphere through which their swarming
legions marched. The thunder-peals were constant and deafening;
explosion followed explosion with but inconsequential intervals between,
and the reports grew steadily sharper and higher-keyed, and more trying
to the ear; the lightning was as diligent as the thunder, and produced
effects which enchanted the eye and sent electric ecstasies of mixed
delight and apprehension shivering along every nerve in the body in
unintermittent procession. The rain poured down in amazing volume; the
ear-splitting thunder-peals broke nearer and nearer; the wind increased
in fury and began to wrench off boughs and tree-tops and send them
sailing away through space; the pilot-house fell to rocking and
straining and cracking and surging, and I went down in the hold to see
what time it was.</p>
<p>People boast a good deal about Alpine thunderstorms; but the storms
which I have had the luck to see in the Alps were not the equals of some
which I have seen in the Mississippi Valley. I may not have seen the
Alps do their best, of course, and if they can beat the Mississippi, I
don’t wish to.</p>
<p>On this up trip I saw a little towhead (infant island) half a mile
long, which had been formed during the past nineteen years. Since there
was so much time to spare that nineteen years of it could be devoted to
the construction of a mere towhead, where was the use, originally, in
rushing this whole globe through in six days? It is likely that if more
time had been taken, in the first place, the world would have been made
right, and this ceaseless improving and repairing would not be necessary
now. But if you hurry a world or a house, you are nearly sure to find
out by and by that you have left out a towhead, or a broom-closet, or
some other little convenience, here and there, which has got to be
supplied, no matter how much expense and vexation it may cost.</p>
<p>We had a succession of black nights, going up the river, and it was
observable that whenever we landed, and suddenly inundated the trees
with the intense sunburst of the electric light, a certain curious
effect was always produced: hundreds of birds flocked instantly out from
the masses of shining green foliage, and went careering hither and
thither through the white rays, and often a song-bird tuned up and fell
to singing. We judged that they mistook this superb artificial day for
the genuine article. We had a delightful trip in that thoroughly well-
ordered steamer, and regretted that it was accomplished so speedily. By
means of diligence and activity, we managed to hunt out nearly all the
old friends. One was missing, however; he went to his reward, whatever
it was, two years ago. But I found out all about him. His case helped me
to realize how lasting can be the effect of a very trifling occurrence.
When he was an apprentice-blacksmith in our village, and I a schoolboy,
a couple of young Englishmen came to the town and sojourned a while; and
one day they got themselves up in cheap royal finery and did the Richard
III swordfight with maniac energy and prodigious powwow, in the presence
of the village boys. This blacksmith cub was there, and the histrionic
poison entered his bones. This vast, lumbering, ignorant, dull-witted
lout was stage-struck, and irrecoverably. He disappeared, and presently
turned up in St. Louis. I ran across him there, by and by. He was
standing musing on a street corner, with his left hand on his hip, the
thumb of his right supporting his chin, face bowed and frowning, slouch
hat pulled down over his forehead–imagining himself to be Othello or
some such character, and imagining that the passing crowd marked his
tragic bearing and were awestruck.</p>
<p>I joined him, and tried to get him down out of the clouds, but did
not succeed. However, he casually informed me, presently, that he was a
member of the Walnut Street theater company–and he tried to say it with
indifference, but the indifference was thin, and a mighty exultation
showed through it. He said he was cast for a part in Julius Caesar, for
that night, and if I should come I would see him. IF I should come! I
said I wouldn’t miss it if I were dead.</p>
<p>I went away stupefied with astonishment, and saying to myself, ‘How
strange it is! WE always thought this fellow a fool; yet the moment he
comes to a great city, where intelligence and appreciation abound, the
talent concealed in this shabby napkin is at once discovered, and
promptly welcomed and honored.’</p>
<p>But I came away from the theater that night disappointed and
offended; for I had had no glimpse of my hero, and his name was not in
the bills. I met him on the street the next morning, and before I could
speak, he asked–</p>
<p>‘Did you see me?’</p>
<p>‘No, you weren’t there.’</p>
<p>He looked surprised and disappointed. He said–</p>
<p>‘Yes, I was. Indeed I was. I was a Roman soldier.’</p>
<p>‘Which one?’</p>
<p>‘Why didn’t you see them Roman soldiers that stood back there in a
rank, and sometimes marched in procession around the stage?’</p>
<p>‘Do you mean the Roman army?–those six sandaled roustabouts in
nightshirts, with tin shields and helmets, that marched around treading
on each other’s heels, in charge of a spider-legged consumptive dressed
like themselves?’</p>
<p>‘That’s it! that’s it! I was one of them Roman soldiers. I was the
next to the last one. A half a year ago I used to always be the last
one; but I’ve been promoted.’</p>
<p>Well, they told me that that poor fellow remained a Roman soldier to
the last–a matter of thirty-four years. Sometimes they cast him for a
‘speaking part,’ but not an elaborate one. He could be trusted to go and
say, ‘My lord, the carriage waits,’ but if they ventured to add a
sentence or two to this, his memory felt the strain and he was likely to
miss fire. Yet, poor devil, he had been patiently studying the part of
Hamlet for more than thirty years, and he lived and died in the belief
that some day he would be invited to play it!</p>
<p>And this is what came of that fleeting visit of those young
Englishmen to our village such ages and ages ago! What noble horseshoes
this man might have made, but for those Englishmen; and what an
inadequate Roman soldier he DID make!</p>
<p>A day or two after we reached St. Louis, I was walking along Fourth
Street when a grizzly-headed man gave a sort of start as he passed me,
then stopped, came back, inspected me narrowly, with a clouding brow,
and finally said with deep asperity–</p>
<p>‘Look here, HAVE YOU GOT THAT DRINK YET?’</p>
<p>A maniac, I judged, at first. But all in a flash I recognized him. I
made an effort to blush that strained every muscle in me, and answered
as sweetly and winningly as ever I knew how–</p>
<p>‘Been a little slow, but am just this minute closing in on the place
where they keep it. Come in and help.’</p>
<p>He softened, and said make it a bottle of champagne and he was
agreeable. He said he had seen my name in the papers, and had put all
his affairs aside and turned out, resolved to find me or die; and make
me answer that question satisfactorily, or kill me; though the most of
his late asperity had been rather counterfeit than otherwise.</p>
<p>This meeting brought back to me the St. Louis riots of about thirty
years ago. I spent a week there, at that time, in a boarding-house, and
had this young fellow for a neighbor across the hall. We saw some of the
fightings and killings; and by and by we went one night to an armory
where two hundred young men had met, upon call, to be armed and go forth
against the rioters, under command of a military man. We drilled till
about ten o’clock at night; then news came that the mob were in great
force in the lower end of the town, and were sweeping everything before
them. Our column moved at once. It was a very hot night, and my musket
was very heavy. We marched and marched; and the nearer we approached the
seat of war, the hotter I grew and the thirstier I got. I was behind my
friend; so, finally, I asked him to hold my musket while I dropped out
and got a drink. Then I branched off and went home. I was not feeling
any solicitude about him of course, because I knew he was so well armed,
now, that he could take care of himself without any trouble. If I had
had any doubts about that, I would have borrowed another musket for him.
I left the city pretty early the next morning, and if this grizzled man
had not happened to encounter my name in the papers the other day in
St. Louis, and felt moved to seek me out, I should have carried to my
grave a heart-torturing uncertainty as to whether he ever got out of the
riots all right or not. I ought to have inquired, thirty years ago; I
know that. And I would have inquired, if I had had the muskets; but, in
the circumstances, he seemed better fixed to conduct the investigations
than I was.</p>
<p>One Monday, near the time of our visit to St. Louis, the ‘Globe-
Democrat’ came out with a couple of pages of Sunday statistics, whereby
it appeared that 119,448 St. Louis people attended the morning and
evening church services the day before, and 23,102 children attended
Sunday-school. Thus 142,550 persons, out of the city’s total of 400,000
population, respected the day religious-wise. I found these statistics,
in a condensed form, in a telegram of the Associated Press, and
preserved them. They made it apparent that St. Louis was in a higher
state of grace than she could have claimed to be in my time. But now
that I canvass the figures narrowly, I suspect that the telegraph
mutilated them. It cannot be that there are more than 150,000 Catholics
in the town; the other 250,000 must be classified as Protestants. Out of
these 250,000, according to this questionable telegram, only 26,362
attended church and Sunday-school, while out of the 150,000 Catholics,
116,188 went to church and Sunday-school.</p>
