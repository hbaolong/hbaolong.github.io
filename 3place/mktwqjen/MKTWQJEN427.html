<h4 id="chapter-44-city-sights">Chapter 44 City Sights</h4>
<p>THE old French part of New Orleans–anciently the Spanish part–bears
no resemblance to the American end of the city: the American end which
lies beyond the intervening brick business-center. The houses are massed
in blocks; are austerely plain and dignified; uniform of pattern, with
here and there a departure from it with pleasant effect; all are
plastered on the outside, and nearly all have long, iron-railed verandas
running along the several stories. Their chief beauty is the deep, warm,
varicolored stain with which time and the weather have enriched the
plaster. It harmonizes with all the surroundings, and has as natural a
look of belonging there as has the flush upon sunset clouds. This
charming decoration cannot be successfully imitated; neither is it to be
found elsewhere in America.</p>
<p>The iron railings are a specialty, also. The pattern is often
exceedingly light and dainty, and airy and graceful–with a large cipher
or monogram in the center, a delicate cobweb of baffling, intricate
forms, wrought in steel. The ancient railings are hand-made, and are now
comparatively rare and proportionately valuable. They are become
BRIC-A-BRAC.</p>
<p>The party had the privilege of idling through this ancient quarter of
New Orleans with the South’s finest literary genius, the author of ‘the
Grandissimes.’ In him the South has found a masterly delineator of its
interior life and its history. In truth, I find by experience, that the
untrained eye and vacant mind can inspect it, and learn of it, and judge
of it, more clearly and profitably in his books than by personal contact
with it.</p>
<p>With Mr. Cable along to see for you, and describe and explain and
illuminate, a jog through that old quarter is a vivid pleasure. And you
have a vivid sense as of unseen or dimly seen things–vivid, and yet
fitful and darkling; you glimpse salient features, but lose the fine
shades or catch them imperfectly through the vision of the imagination:
a case, as it were, of ignorant near-sighted stranger traversing the rim
of wide vague horizons of Alps with an inspired and enlightened long-
sighted native.</p>
<p>We visited the old St. Louis Hotel, now occupied by municipal
offices. There is nothing strikingly remarkable about it; but one can
say of it as of the Academy of Music in New York, that if a broom or a
shovel has ever been used in it there is no circumstantial evidence to
back up the fact. It is curious that cabbages and hay and things do not
grow in the Academy of Music; but no doubt it is on account of the
interruption of the light by the benches, and the impossibility of
hoeing the crop except in the aisles. The fact that the ushers grow
their buttonhole- bouquets on the premises shows what might be done if
they had the right kind of an agricultural head to the
establishment.</p>
<p>We visited also the venerable Cathedral, and the pretty square in
front of it; the one dim with religious light, the other brilliant with
the worldly sort, and lovely with orange-trees and blossomy shrubs; then
we drove in the hot sun through the wilderness of houses and out on to
the wide dead level beyond, where the villas are, and the water wheels
to drain the town, and the commons populous with cows and children;
passing by an old cemetery where we were told lie the ashes of an early
pirate; but we took him on trust, and did not visit him. He was a pirate
with a tremendous and sanguinary history; and as long as he preserved
unspotted, in retirement, the dignity of his name and the grandeur of
his ancient calling, homage and reverence were his from high and low;
but when at last he descended into politics and became a paltry
alderman, the public ‘shook’ him, and turned aside and wept. When he
died, they set up a monument over him; and little by little he has come
into respect again; but it is respect for the pirate, not the alderman.
To-day the loyal and generous remember only what he was, and charitably
forget what he became.</p>
<p>Thence, we drove a few miles across a swamp, along a raised shell
road, with a canal on one hand and a dense wood on the other; and here
and there, in the distance, a ragged and angular-limbed and moss-bearded
cypress, top standing out, clear cut against the sky, and as quaint of
form as the apple-trees in Japanese pictures–such was our course and the
surroundings of it. There was an occasional alligator swimming
comfortably along in the canal, and an occasional picturesque colored
person on the bank, flinging his statue-rigid reflection upon the still
water and watching for a bite.</p>
<p>And by-and-bye we reached the West End, a collection of hotels of the
usual light summer-resort pattern, with broad verandas all around, and
the waves of the wide and blue Lake Pontchartrain lapping the
thresholds. We had dinner on a ground-veranda over the water–the chief
dish the renowned fish called the pompano, delicious as the less
criminal forms of sin.</p>
<p>Thousands of people come by rail and carriage to West End and to
Spanish Fort every evening, and dine, listen to the bands, take strolls
in the open air under the electric lights, go sailing on the lake, and
entertain themselves in various and sundry other ways.</p>
<p>We had opportunities on other days and in other places to test the
pompano. Notably, at an editorial dinner at one of the clubs in the
city. He was in his last possible perfection there, and justified his
fame. In his suite was a tall pyramid of scarlet cray-fish–large ones;
as large as one’s thumb–delicate, palatable, appetizing. Also deviled
whitebait; also shrimps of choice quality; and a platter of small soft-
shell crabs of a most superior breed. The other dishes were what one
might get at Delmonico’s, or Buckingham Palace; those I have spoken of
can be had in similar perfection in New Orleans only, I suppose.</p>
<p>In the West and South they have a new institution–the Broom Brigade.
It is composed of young ladies who dress in a uniform costume, and go
through the infantry drill, with broom in place of musket. It is a very
pretty sight, on private view. When they perform on the stage of a
theater, in the blaze of colored fires, it must be a fine and
fascinating spectacle. I saw them go through their complex manual with
grace, spirit, and admirable precision. I saw them do everything which a
human being can possibly do with a broom, except sweep. I did not see
them sweep. But I know they could learn. What they have already learned
proves that. And if they ever should learn, and should go on the war-
path down Tchoupitoulas or some of those other streets around there,
those thoroughfares would bear a greatly improved aspect in a very few
minutes. But the girls themselves wouldn’t; so nothing would be really
gained, after all.</p>
<p>The drill was in the Washington Artillery building. In this building
we saw many interesting relics of the war. Also a fine oil-painting
representing Stonewall Jackson’s last interview with General Lee. Both
men are on horseback. Jackson has just ridden up, and is accosting Lee.
The picture is very valuable, on account of the portraits, which are
authentic. But, like many another historical picture, it means nothing
without its label. And one label will fit it as well as another–</p>
<p>First Interview between Lee and Jackson.</p>
<p>Last Interview between Lee and Jackson.</p>
<p>Jackson Introducing Himself to Lee.</p>
<p>Jackson Accepting Lee’s Invitation to Dinner.</p>
<p>Jackson Declining Lee’s Invitation to Dinner–with Thanks.</p>
<p>Jackson Apologizing for a Heavy Defeat.</p>
<p>Jackson Reporting a Great Victory.</p>
<p>Jackson Asking Lee for a Match.</p>
<p>It tells ONE story, and a sufficient one; for it says quite plainly
and satisfactorily, ‘Here are Lee and Jackson together.’ The artist
would have made it tell that this is Lee and Jackson’s last interview if
he could have done it. But he couldn’t, for there wasn’t any way to do
it. A good legible label is usually worth, for information, a ton of
significant attitude and expression in a historical picture. In Rome,
people with fine sympathetic natures stand up and weep in front of the
celebrated ‘Beatrice Cenci the Day before her Execution.’ It shows what
a label can do. If they did not know the picture, they would inspect it
unmoved, and say, ‘Young girl with hay fever; young girl with her head
in a bag.’</p>
<p>I found the half-forgotten Southern intonations and elisions as
pleasing to my ear as they had formerly been. A Southerner talks music.
At least it is music to me, but then I was born in the South. The
educated Southerner has no use for an r, except at the beginning of a
word. He says ‘honah,’ and ‘dinnah,’ and ‘Gove’nuh,’ and ‘befo’ the
waw,’ and so on. The words may lack charm to the eye, in print, but they
have it to the ear. When did the r disappear from Southern speech, and
how did it come to disappear? The custom of dropping it was not borrowed
from the North, nor inherited from England. Many Southerners–most
Southerners– put a y into occasional words that begin with the k sound.
For instance, they say Mr. K’yahtah (Carter) and speak of playing
k’yahds or of riding in the k’yahs. And they have the pleasant
custom–long ago fallen into decay in the North–of frequently employing
the respectful ‘Sir.’ Instead of the curt Yes, and the abrupt No, they
say ‘Yes, Suh’, ‘No, Suh.’</p>
<p>But there are some infelicities. Such as ‘like’ for ‘as,’ and the
addition of an ‘at’ where it isn’t needed. I heard an educated gentleman
say, ‘Like the flag-officer did.’ His cook or his butler would have
said, ‘Like the flag-officer done.’ You hear gentlemen say, ‘Where have
you been at?’ And here is the aggravated form–heard a ragged street Arab
say it to a comrade: ‘I was a-ask’n’ Tom whah you was a-sett’n’ at.’ The
very elect carelessly say ‘will’ when they mean ‘shall’; and many of
them say, ‘I didn’t go to do it,’ meaning ‘I didn’t mean to do it.’ The
Northern word ‘guess’–imported from England, where it used to be common,
and now regarded by satirical Englishmen as a Yankee original–is but
little used among Southerners. They say ‘reckon.’ They haven’t any
‘doesn’t’ in their language; they say ‘don’t’ instead. The unpolished
often use ‘went’ for ‘gone.’ It is nearly as bad as the Northern ‘hadn’t
ought.’ This reminds me that a remark of a very peculiar nature was made
here in my neighborhood (in the North) a few days ago: ‘He hadn’t ought
to have went.’ How is that? Isn’t that a good deal of a triumph? One
knows the orders combined in this half- breed’s architecture without
inquiring: one parent Northern, the other Southern. To-day I heard a
schoolmistress ask, ‘Where is John gone?’ This form is so common–so
nearly universal, in fact–that if she had used ‘whither’ instead of
‘where,’ I think it would have sounded like an affectation.</p>
<p>We picked up one excellent word–a word worth traveling to New Orleans
to get; a nice limber, expressive, handy word–‘lagniappe.’ They
pronounce it lanny-yap. It is Spanish–so they said. We discovered it at
the head of a column of odds and ends in the Picayune, the first day;
heard twenty people use it the second; inquired what it meant the third;
adopted it and got facility in swinging it the fourth. It has a
restricted meaning, but I think the people spread it out a little when
they choose. It is the equivalent of the thirteenth roll in a ‘baker’s
dozen.’ It is something thrown in, gratis, for good measure. The custom
originated in the Spanish quarter of the city. When a child or a servant
buys something in a shop–or even the mayor or the governor, for aught I
know–he finishes the operation by saying–</p>
<p>‘Give me something for lagniappe.’</p>
<p>The shopman always responds; gives the child a bit of licorice-root,
gives the servant a cheap cigar or a spool of thread, gives the
governor–I don’t know what he gives the governor; support, likely.</p>
<p>When you are invited to drink, and this does occur now and then in
New Orleans–and you say, ‘What, again?–no, I’ve had enough;’ the other
party says, ‘But just this one time more–this is for lagniappe.’ When
the beau perceives that he is stacking his compliments a trifle too
high, and sees by the young lady’s countenance that the edifice would
have been better with the top compliment left off, he puts his ‘I beg
pardon–no harm intended,’ into the briefer form of ‘Oh, that’s for
lagniappe.’ If the waiter in the restaurant stumbles and spills a gill
of coffee down the back of your neck, he says ‘For lagniappe, sah,’ and
gets you another cup without extra charge.</p>
