<h4 id="john-chinaman-in-new-york">JOHN CHINAMAN IN NEW YORK</h4>
<p>As I passed along by one of those monster American tea stores in New
York, I found a Chinaman sitting before it acting in the capacity of a
sign. Everybody that passed by gave him a steady stare as long as their
heads would twist over their shoulders without dislocating their necks,
and a group had stopped to stare deliberately.</p>
<p>Is it not a shame that we, who prate so much about civilization and
humanity, are content to degrade a fellow-being to such an office as
this? Is it not time for reflection when we find ourselves willing to
see in such a being matter for frivolous curiosity instead of regret and
grave reflection? Here was a poor creature whom hard fortune had exiled
from his natural home beyond the seas, and whose troubles ought to have
touched these idle strangers that thronged about him; but did it?
Apparently not. Men calling themselves the superior race, the race of
culture and of gentle blood, scanned his quaint Chinese hat, with peaked
roof and ball on top, and his long queue dangling down his back; his
short silken blouse, curiously frogged and figured (and, like the rest
of his raiment, rusty, dilapidated, and awkwardly put on); his blue
cotton, tight-legged pants, tied close around the ankles; and his clumsy
blunt-toed shoes with thick cork soles; and having so scanned him from
head to foot, cracked some unseemly joke about his outlandish attire or
his melancholy face, and passed on. In my heart I pitied the friendless
Mongol. I wondered what was passing behind his sad face, and what
distant scene his vacant eye was dreaming of. Were his thoughts with his
heart, ten thousand miles away, beyond the billowy wastes of the
Pacific? among the ricefields and the plumy palms of China? under the
shadows of remembered mountain peaks, or in groves of bloomy shrubs and
strange forest trees unknown to climes like ours? And now and then,
rippling among his visions and his dreams, did he hear familiar laughter
and half-forgotten voices, and did he catch fitful glimpses of the
friendly faces of a bygone time? A cruel fate it is, I said, that is
befallen this bronzed wanderer. In order that the group of idlers might
be touched at least by the words of the poor fellow, since the appeal of
his pauper dress and his dreary exile was lost upon them, I touched him
on the shoulder and said:</p>
<p>“Cheer up–don’t be downhearted. It is not America that treats you in
this way, it is merely one citizen, whose greed of gain has eaten the
humanity out of his heart. America has a broader hospitality for the
exiled and oppressed. America and Americans are always ready to help the
unfortunate. Money shall be raised–you shall go back to China you shall
see your friends again. What wages do they pay you here?“</p>
<p>“Divil a cint but four dollars a week and find meself; but it’s aisy,
barrin’ the troublesome furrin clothes that’s so expinsive.“</p>
<p>The exile remains at his post. The New York tea merchants who need
picturesque signs are not likely to run out of Chinamen.</p>
<p>HOW I EDITED AN AGRICULTURAL PAPER–[Written abort 1870.]</p>
<p>I did not take temporary editorship of an agricultural paper without
misgivings. Neither would a landsman take command of a ship without
misgivings. But I was in circumstances that made the salary an object.
The regular editor of the paper was going off for a holiday, and I
accepted the terms he offered, and took his place.</p>
<p>The sensation of being at work again was luxurious, and I wrought all
the week with unflagging pleasure. We went to press, and I waited a day
with some solicitude to see whether my effort was going to attract any
notice. As I left the office, toward sundown, a group of men and boys at
the foot of the stairs dispersed with one impulse, and gave me
passageway, and I heard one or two of them say: “That’s him!“ I was
naturally pleased by this incident. The next morning I found a similar
group at the foot of the stairs, and scattering couples and individuals
standing here and there in the street and over the way, watching me with
interest. The group separated and fell back as I approached, and I heard
a man say, “Look at his eye!“ I pretended not to observe the notice I
was attracting, but secretly I was pleased with it, and was purposing to
write an account of it to my aunt. I went up the short flight of stairs,
and heard cheery voices and a ringing laugh as I drew near the door,
which I opened, and caught a glimpse of two young rural-looking men,
whose faces blanched and lengthened when they saw me, and then they both
plunged through the window with a great crash. I was surprised.</p>
<p>In about half an hour an old gentleman, with a flowing beard and a
fine but rather austere face, entered, and sat down at my invitation. He
seemed to have something on his mind. He took off his hat and set it on
the floor, and got out of it a red silk handkerchief and a copy of our
paper.</p>
<p>He put the paper on his lap, and while he polished his spectacles
with his handkerchief he said, “Are you the new editor?“</p>
<p>I said I was.</p>
<p>“Have you ever edited an agricultural paper before?“</p>
<p>“No,“ I said; “this is my first attempt.“</p>
<p>“Very likely. Have you had any experience in agriculture
practically?“</p>
<p>“No; I believe I have not.“</p>
<p>“Some instinct told me so,“ said the old gentleman, putting on his
spectacles, and looking over them at me with asperity, while he folded
his paper into a convenient shape. “I wish to read you what must have
made me have that instinct. It was this editorial. Listen, and see if it
was you that wrote it:</p>
<p>“‘Turnips should never be pulled, it injures them. It is much better
to send a boy up and let him shake the tree.’</p>
<p>“Now, what do you think of that? for I really suppose you wrote
it?“</p>
<p>“Think of it? Why, I think it is good. I think it is sense. I have no
doubt that every year millions and millions of bushels of turnips are
spoiled in this township alone by being pulled in a half-ripe condition,
when, if they had sent a boy up to shake the tree–“</p>
<p>“Shake your grandmother! Turnips don’t grow on trees!“</p>
<p>“Oh, they don’t, don’t they? Well, who said they did? The language
was intended to be figurative, wholly figurative. Anybody that knows
anything will know that I meant that the boy should shake the vine.“</p>
<p>Then this old person got up and tore his paper all into small shreds,
and stamped on them, and broke several things with his cane, and said I
did not know as much as a cow; and then went–out and banged the door
after him, and, in short, acted in such a way that I fancied he was
displeased about something. But not knowing what the trouble was, I
could not be any help to him.</p>
<p>Pretty soon after this a long, cadaverous creature, with lanky locks
hanging down to his shoulders, and a week’s stubble bristling from the
hills and valleys of his face, darted within the door, and halted,
motionless, with finger on lip, and head and body bent in listening
attitude. No sound was heard.</p>
<p>Still he listened. No sound. Then he turned the key in the door, and
came elaborately tiptoeing toward me till he was within long reaching
distance of me, when he stopped and, after scanning my face with intense
interest for a while, drew a folded copy of our paper from his bosom,
and said:</p>
<p>“There, you wrote that. Read it to me–quick! Relieve me. I
suffer.“</p>
<p>I read as follows; and as the sentences fell from my lips I could see
the relief come, I could see the drawn muscles relax, and the anxiety go
out of the face, and rest and peace steal over the features like the
merciful moonlight over a desolate landscape:</p>
<p>The guano is a fine bird, but great care is necessary in rearing it.
It should not be imported earlier than June or later than September. In
the winter it should be kept in a warm place, where it can hatch out its
young.</p>
<p>It is evident that we are to have a backward season for grain.
Therefore it will be well for the farmer to begin setting out his
corn-stalks and planting his buckwheat cakes in July instead of
August.</p>
<p>Concerning the pumpkin. This berry is a favorite with the natives of
the interior of New England, who prefer it to the gooseberry for the
making of fruit-cake, and who likewise give it the preference over the
raspberry for feeding cows, as being more filling and fully as
satisfying. The pumpkin is the only esculent of the orange family that
will thrive in the North, except the gourd and one or two varieties of
the squash. But the custom of planting it in the front yard with the
shrubbery is fast going out of vogue, for it is now generally conceded
that, the pumpkin as a shade tree is a failure.</p>
<p>Now, as the warm weather approaches, and the ganders begin to
spawn–</p>
<p>The excited listener sprang toward me to shake hands, and said:</p>
<p>“There, there–that will do. I know I am all right now, because you
have read it just as I did, word, for word. But, stranger, when I first
read it this morning, I said to myself, I never, never believed it
before, notwithstanding my friends kept me under watch so strict, but
now I believe I am crazy; and with that I fetched a howl that you might
have heard two miles, and started out to kill somebody–because, you
know, I knew it would come to that sooner or later, and so I might as
well begin. I read one of them paragraphs over again, so as to be
certain, and then I burned my house down and started. I have crippled
several people, and have got one fellow up a tree, where I can get him
if I want him. But I thought I would call in here as I passed along and
make the thing perfectly certain; and now it is certain, and I tell you
it is lucky for the chap that is in the tree. I should have killed him
sure, as I went back. Good-by, sir, good-by; you have taken a great load
off my mind. My reason has stood the strain of one of your agricultural
articles, and I know that nothing can ever unseat it now. Good-by,
sir.“</p>
<p>I felt a little uncomfortable about the cripplings and arsons this
person had been entertaining himself with, for I could not help feeling
remotely accessory to them. But these thoughts were quickly banished,
for the regular editor walked in! [I thought to myself, Now if you had
gone to Egypt as I recommended you to, I might have had a chance to get
my hand in; but you wouldn’t do it, and here you are. I sort of expected
you.]</p>
<p>The editor was looking sad and perplexed and dejected.</p>
<p>He surveyed the wreck which that old rioter and those two young
farmers had made, and then said “This is a sad business–a very sad
business. There is the mucilage-bottle broken, and six panes of glass,
and a spittoon, and two candlesticks. But that is not the worst. The
reputation of the paper is injured–and permanently, I fear. True, there
never was such a call for the paper before, and it never sold such a
large edition or soared to such celebrity; but does one want to be
famous for lunacy, and prosper upon the infirmities of his mind? My
friend, as I am an honest man, the street out here is full of people,
and others are roosting on the fences, waiting to get a glimpse of you,
because they think you are crazy. And well they might after reading your
editorials. They are a disgrace to journalism. Why, what put it into
your head that you could edit a paper of this nature? You do not seem to
know the first rudiments of agriculture. You speak of a furrow and a
harrow as being the same thing; you talk of the moulting season for
cows; and you recommend the domestication of the pole-cat on account of
its playfulness and its excellence as a ratter! Your remark that clams
will lie quiet if music be played to them was superfluous–entirely
superfluous. Nothing disturbs clams. Clams always lie quiet. Clams care
nothing whatever about music. Ah, heavens and earth, friend! if you had
made the acquiring of ignorance the study of your life, you could not
have graduated with higher honor than you could to-day. I never saw
anything like it. Your observation that the horse-chestnut as an article
of commerce is steadily gaining in favor is simply calculated to destroy
this journal. I want you to throw up your situation and go. I want no
more holiday–I could not enjoy it if I had it. Certainly not with you in
my chair. I would always stand in dread of what you might be going to
recommend next. It makes me lose all patience every time I think of your
discussing oyster-beds under the head of ‘Landscape Gardening.’ I want
you to go. Nothing on earth could persuade me to take another holiday.
Oh! why didn’t you tell me you didn’t know anything about
agriculture?“</p>
<p>“Tell you, you corn-stalk, you cabbage, you son of a cauliflower?
It’s the first time I ever heard such an unfeeling remark. I tell you I
have been in the editorial business going on fourteen years, and it is
the first time I ever heard of a man’s having to know anything in order
to edit a newspaper. You turnip! Who write the dramatic critiques for
the second-rate papers? Why, a parcel of promoted shoemakers and
apprentice apothecaries, who know just as much about good acting as I do
about good farming and no more. Who review the books? People who never
wrote one. Who do up the heavy leaders on finance? Parties who have had
the largest opportunities for knowing nothing about it. Who criticize
the Indian campaigns? Gentlemen who do not know a war-whoop from a
wigwam, and who never have had to run a foot-race with a tomahawk, or
pluck arrows out of the several members of their families to build the
evening camp-fire with. Who write the temperance appeals, and clamor
about the flowing bowl? Folks who will never draw another sober breath
till they do it in the grave. Who edit the agricultural papers, you–yam?
Men, as a general thing, who fail in the poetry line, yellow-colored
novel line, sensation, drama line, city-editor line, and finally fall
back on agriculture as a temporary reprieve from the poorhouse. You try
to tell me anything about the newspaper business! Sir, I have been
through it from Alpha to Omaha, and I tell you that the less a man knows
the bigger the noise he makes and the higher the salary he commands.
Heaven knows if I had but been ignorant instead of cultivated, and
impudent instead of diffident, I could have made a name for myself in
this cold, selfish world. I take my leave, sir. Since I have been
treated as you have treated me, I am perfectly willing to go. But I have
done my duty. I have fulfilled my contract as far as I was permitted to
do it. I said I could make your paper of interest to all classes–and I
have. I said I could run your circulation up to twenty thousand copies,
and if I had had two more weeks I’d have done it. And I’d have given you
the best class of readers that ever an agricultural paper had–not a
farmer in it, nor a solitary individual who could tell a watermelon-tree
from a peach-vine to save his life. You are the loser by this rupture,
not me, Pie-plant. Adios.“</p>
<p>I then left.</p>
