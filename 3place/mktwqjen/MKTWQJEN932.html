1893, TO MR. HALL, MRS. CLEMENS, AND OTHERS. FLORENCE. BUSINESS
TROUBLES. “PUDD’NHEAD WILSON.“ “JOAN OF ARC.“ AT THE PLAYERS, NEW
YORK</h4>
<p>The reader may have suspected that young Mr. Hall in New York was
having his troubles. He was by this time one-third owner in the business
of Charles L. Webster andandandand Co., as well as its general manager.
The business had been drained of its capital one way and another-partly
by the publication of unprofitable books; partly by the earlier demands
of the typesetter, but more than all by the manufacturing cost and
agents’ commissions demanded by L. A. L.; that is to say, the eleven
large volumes constituting the Library of American Literature, which
Webster had undertaken to place in a million American homes. There was
plenty of sale for it–indeed, that was just the trouble; for it was sold
on payments–small monthly payments–while the cost of manufacture and the
liberal agents’ commissions were cash items, and it would require a
considerable period before the dribble of collections would swell into a
tide large enough to satisfy the steady outflow of expense. A sale of
twenty-five sets a day meant prosperity on paper, but unless capital
could be raised from some other source to make and market those books
through a period of months, perhaps even years, to come, it meant
bankruptcy in reality. It was Hall’s job, with Clemens to back him, to
keep their ship afloat on these steadily ebbing financial waters. It was
also Hall’s affair to keep Mark Twain cheerful, to look pleasant
himself, and to show how they were steadily getting rich because orders
were pouring in, though a cloud that resembled bankruptcy loomed always
a little higher upon the horizon. If Hall had not been young and an
optimist, he would have been frightened out of his boots early in the
game. As it was, he made a brave steady fight, kept as cheerful and
stiff an upper lip as possible, always hoping that something would
happen–some grand sale of his other books, some unexpected inflow from
the type-setter interests–anything that would sustain his ship until the
L. A. L. tide should turn and float it into safety.</p>
<p>Clemens had faith in Hall and was fond of him. He never found fault
with him; he tried to accept his encouraging reports at their face
value. He lent the firm every dollar of his literary earnings not
absolutely needed for the family’s support; he signed new notes; he
allowed Mrs. Clemens to put in such remnants of her patrimony as the
type-setter had spared.</p>
<p>The situation in 1893 was about as here outlined. The letters to Hall
of that year are frequent and carry along the story. To any who had
formed the idea that Mark Twain was irascible, exacting, and
faultfinding, they will perhaps be a revelation.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>FLORENCE, Jan. 1, ’93. DEAR MR. HALL,–Yours of Dec. 19 is to hand,
and Mrs. Clemens is deeply distressed, for she thinks I have been
blaming you or finding fault with you about something. But most surely
that cannot be. I tell her that although I am prone to write hasty and
regrettable things to other people, I am not a bit likely to write such
things to you. I can’t believe I have done anything so ungrateful. If I
have, pile coals of fire on my head, for I deserve it!</p>
<p>I wonder if my letter of credit isn’t an encumbrance? Do you have to
deposit the whole amount it calls for? If that is so, it is an
encumbrance, and we must withdraw it and take the money out of soak. I
have never made drafts upon it except when compelled, because I thought
you deposited nothing against it, and only had to put up money that I
drew upon it; that therefore the less I drew the easier it would be for
you.</p>
<p>I am dreadfully sorry I didn’t know it would be a help to you to let
my monthly check pass over a couple of months. I could have stood that
by drawing what is left of Mrs. Clemens’s letter of credit, and we would
have done it cheerfully.</p>
<p>I will write Whitmore to send you the “Century“ check for ,000, and
you can collect Mrs. Dodge’s ,000 (Whitmore has power of attorney which
I think will enable him to endorse it over to you in my name.) If you
need that ,000 put it in the business and use it, and send Whitmore the
Company’s note for a year. If you don’t need it, turn it over to
Mr. Halsey and let him invest it for me.</p>
<p>I’ve a mighty poor financial head, and I may be all wrong–but tell me
if I am wrong in supposing that in lending my own firm money at 6 per
cent I pay 4 of it myself and so really get only a per cent? Now don’t
laugh if that is stupid.</p>
<p>Of course my friend declined to buy a quarter interest in the L. A.
L. for 00,000. I judged he would. I hoped he would offer 00,000, but he
didn’t. If the cholera breaks out in America, a few months hence, we
can’t borrow or sell; but if it doesn’t we must try hard to raise
00,000. I wish we could do it before there is a cholera scare.</p>
<p>I have been in bed two or three days with a cold, but I got up an
hour ago, and I believe I am all right again.</p>
<p>How I wish I had appreciated the need of 00,000 when I was in New
York last summer! I would have tried my best to raise it. It would make
us able to stand 1,000 sets of L. A. L. per month, but not any more, I
guess.</p>
<p>You have done magnificently with the business, and we must raise the
money somehow, to enable you to reap the reward of all that labor.
Sincerely Yours S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>“Whitmore,“ in this letter, was F. G. Whitmore, of Hartford, Mark
Twain’s financial agent. The money due from Mrs. Dodge was a balance on
Tom Sawyer Abroad, which had been accepted by St. Nicholas. Mr. Halsey
was a down-town broker.</p>
<p>Clemens, who was growing weary of the constant demands of L. A. L.,
had conceived the idea that it would be well to dispose of a portion of
it for enough cash to finance its manufacture.</p>
<p>We don’t know who the friend was to whom he offered a quarter
interest for the modest sum of two hundred thousand dollars. But in the
next letter we discover designs on a certain very canny Scotchman of
Skibo.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>FLORENCE, Jan. 28, ’92. DEAR MR. HALL,–I want to throw out a
suggestion and see what you think of it. We have a good start, and solid
ground under us; we have a valuable reputation; our business
organization is practical, sound and well-devised; our publications are
of a respect-worthy character and of a money-breeding species. Now then
I think that the association with us of some one of great name and with
capital would give our business a prodigious impetus–that phrase is not
too strong.</p>
<p>As I look at it, it is not money merely that is needed; if that were
all, the firm has friends enough who would take an interest in a paying
venture; we need some one who has made his life a success not only from
a business standpoint, but with that achievement back of him, has been
great enough to make his power felt as a thinker and a literary man. It
is a pretty usual thing for publishers to have this sort of partners.
Now you see what a power Carnegie is, and how far his voice reaches in
the several lines I speak of. Do you know him? You do by correspondence
or purely business talks about his books–but personally, I mean? so that
it would not be an intrusion for you to speak to him about this desire
of mine–for I would like you to put it before him, and if you fail to
interest him in it, you will probably get at least some valuable
suggestions from him. I’ll enclose a note of introduction–you needn’t
use it if you don’t need to. Yours S. L. C.</p>
<p>P. S. Yes, I think I have already acknowledged the Dec. ,000 and the
Jan. 00–and if another 00 was mailed 3 days ago there’s no hiatus.</p>
<p>I think I also reminded you that the new letter of credit does not
cover the unexpended balance of the old one but falls considerably short
of it.</p>
<p>Do your best with Carnegie, and don’t wait to consider any of my
intermediate suggestions or talks about our raising half of the 00,000
ourselves. I mean, wait for nothing. To make my suggestion available I
should have to go over and see Arnot, and I don’t want to until I can
mention Carnegie’s name to him as going in with us.</p>
<p>My book is type-written and ready for print–“Pudd’nhead Wilson-a
Tale.“ (Or, “Those Extraordinary Twins,“ if preferable.)</p>
<p>It makes 82,500 words–12,000 more than Huck Finn. But I don’t know
what to do with it. Mrs. Clemens thinks it wouldn’t do to go to the Am.
Pub. Co. or anywhere outside of our own house; we have no subscription
machinery, and a book in the trade is a book thrown away, as far as
money-profit goes. I am in a quandary. Give me a lift out of it.</p>
<p>I will mail the book to you and get you to examine it and see if it
is good or if it is bad. I think it is good, and I thought the Claimant
bad, when I saw it in print; but as for real judgment, I think I am
destitute of it.</p>
<p>I am writing a companion to the Prince and Pauper, which is half done
and will make 200,000 words; and I have had the idea that if it were
gotten up in handsome style, with many illustrations and put at a high
enough price maybe the L. A. L. canvassers would take it and run it with
that book. Would they? It could be priced anywhere from up to 0,
according to how it was gotten up, I suppose.</p>
<p>I don’t want it to go into a magazine. S. L. C.</p>
<p>I am having several short things type-“writered.“ I will send them to
you presently. I like the Century and Harper’s, but I don’t know that I
have any business to object to the Cosmopolitan if they pay as good
rates. I suppose a man ought to stick to one magazine, but that may be
only superstition. What do you think? S. L. C.</p>
<p>“The companion to The Prince and the Pauper,“ mentioned in this
letter, was the story of Joan of Arc, perhaps the most finished of Mark
Twain’s literary productions. His interest in Joan had been first
awakened when, as a printer’s apprentice in Hannibal, he had found
blowing along the street a stray leaf from some printed story of her
life. That fragment of history had pictured Joan in prison, insulted and
mistreated by ruffians. It had aroused all the sympathy and indignation
in the boy, Sam Clemens; also, it had awakened his interest in history,
and, indeed, in all literature.</p>
<p>His love for the character of Joan had grown with the years, until in
time he had conceived the idea of writing her story. As far back as the
early eighties he had collected material for it, and had begun to make
the notes. One thing and another had interfered, and he had found no
opportunity for such a story. Now, however, in Florence, in the ancient
villa, and in the quiet garden, looking across the vineyards and olive
groves to the dream city along the Arno, he felt moved to take up the
tale of the shepherd girl of France, the soldier maid, or, as he called
her, “The noble child, the most innocent, the most lovely, the most
adorable the ages have produced.“ His surroundings and background would
seem to have been perfect, and he must have written with considerable
ease to have completed a hundred thousand words in a period of not more
than six weeks.</p>
<p>Perhaps Hall did not even go to see Carnegie; at all events nothing
seems to have come of the idea. Once, at a later time, Mask Twain
himself mentioned the matter to Carnegie, and suggested to him that it
was poor financiering to put all of one’s eggs into one basket, meaning
into iron. But Carnegie answered, “That’s a mistake; put all your eggs
into one basket and watch that basket.“</p>
<p>It was March when Clemens felt that once more his presence was
demanded in America. He must see if anything could be realized from the
type-setter or L. A. L.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>March 13, ’93. DEAR MR. HALL,–I am busy getting ready to sail the
22d, in the Kaiser Wilhelm II.</p>
<p>I send herewith 2 magazine articles.</p>
<p>The Story contains 3,800 to 4,000 words.</p>
<p>The “Diary“ contains 3,800 words.</p>
<p>Each would make about 4 pages of the Century.</p>
<p>The Diary is a gem, if I do say it myself that shouldn’t.</p>
<p>If the Cosmopolitan wishes to pay 00 for either of them or ,200 for
both, gather in the check, and I will use the money in America instead
of breaking into your treasury.</p>
<p>If they don’t wish to trade for either, send the articles to the
Century, without naming a price, and if their check isn’t large enough I
will call and abuse them when I come.</p>
<p>I signed and mailed the notes yesterday. Yours S. L. C.</p>
<p>Clemens reached New York on the 3d of April and made a trip to
Chicago, but accomplished nothing, except to visit the World’s Fair and
be laid up with a severe cold. The machine situation had not progressed.
The financial stringency of 1893 had brought everything to a standstill.
The New York bank would advance Webster andandandand Co. no more money.
So disturbed were his affairs, so disordered was everything, that
sometimes he felt himself as one walking amid unrealities. A fragment of
a letter to Mrs. Crane conveys this:</p>
<p>“I dreamed I was born and grew up and was a pilot on the Mississippi
and a miner and a journalist in Nevada and a pilgrim in the Quaker City,
and had a wife and children and went to live in a villa at Florence–and
this dream goes on and on and sometimes seems so real that I almost
believe it is real. I wonder if it is? But there is no way to tell, for
if one applies tests they would be part of the dream, too, and so would
simply aid the deceit. I wish I knew whether it is a dream or real.“</p>
<p>He saw Warner, briefly, in America; also Howells, now living in New
York, but he had little time for visiting. On May 13th he sailed again
for Europe on the Kaiser Wilhelm II. On the night before sailing he sent
Howells a good-by word.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in New York City:</p>
<p>MURRAY HILL HOTEL, NEW YORE, May 12, 1893. Midnight. DEAR HOWELLS–I
am so sorry I missed you.</p>
<p>I am very glad to have that book for sea entertainment, and I thank
you ever so much for it.</p>
<p>I’ve had a little visit with Warner at last; I was getting afraid I
wasn’t going to have a chance to see him at all. I forgot to tell you
how thoroughly I enjoyed your account of the country printing office,
and how true it all was and how intimately recognizable in all its
details. But Warner was full of delight over it, and that reminded me,
and I am glad, for I wanted to speak of it.</p>
<p>You have given me a book; Annie Trumbull has sent me her book; I
bought a couple of books; Mr. Hall gave me a choice German book; Laflan
gave me two bottles of whisky and a box of cigars–I go to sea nobly
equipped.</p>
<p>Good-bye and all good fortune attend you and yours–and upon you all I
leave my benediction. MARK.</p>
<p>Mention has already been made of the Ross home being very near to
Viviani, and the association of the Ross and Clemens families. There was
a fine vegetable garden on the Ross estate, and it was in the interest
of it that the next letter was written to the Secretary of
Agriculture.</p>
<p>To Hon. J. Sterling Morton, in Washington, D. C.: Editorial
Department Century Magazine, Union Square,</p>
<p>NEW YORK, April 6, 1893. TO THE HON. J. STERLING MORTON,–Dear Sir:
Your petitioner, Mark Twain, a poor farmer of Connecticut–indeed, the
poorest one there, in the opinion of many-desires a few choice breeds of
seed corn (maize), and in return will zealously support the
Administration in all ways honorable and otherwise.</p>
<p>To speak by the card, I want these things to hurry to Italy to an
English lady. She is a neighbor of mine outside of Florence, and has a
great garden and thinks she could raise corn for her table if she had
the right ammunition. I myself feel a warm interest in this enterprise,
both on patriotic grounds and because I have a key to that garden, which
I got made from a wax impression. It is not very good soil, still I
think she can grow enough for one table and I am in a position to select
the table. If you are willing to aid and abet a countryman (and Gilder
thinks you are,) please find the signature and address of your
petitioner below.</p>
<p>Respectfully and truly yours. MARK TWAIN,</p>
<p>67 Fifth Avenue, New York.</p>
<p>P. S.–A handful of choice (Southern) watermelon seeds would
pleasantly add to that lady’s employments and give my table a
corresponding lift.</p>
<p>His idea of business values had moderated considerably by the time he
had returned to Florence. He was not hopeless yet, but he was clearly a
good deal disheartened–anxious for freedom.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>FLORENCE May 30, ’93 DEAR MR. HALL,–You were to cable me if you sold
any machine royalties –so I judge you have not succeeded.</p>
<p>This has depressed me. I have been looking over the past year’s
letters and statements and am depressed still more.</p>
<p>I am terribly tired of business. I am by nature and disposition
unfitted for it and I want to get out of it. I am standing on the Mount
Morris volcano with help from the machine a long way off–doubtless a
long way further off than the Connecticut Co. imagines.</p>
<p>Now here is my idea for getting out.</p>
<p>The firm owes Mrs. Clemens and me–I do not know quite how much, but
it is about 70,000 or 75,000, I suppose (I make this guess from the
documents here, whose technicalities confuse me horribly.)</p>
<p>The firm owes other sums, but there is stock and cash assets to cover
the entire indebtedness and 16,679.20 over. Is that it? In addition we
have the L. A. L. plates and copyright, worth more than 30,000–is that
correct?</p>
<p>That is to say, we have property worth about 50,000 above
indebtedness, I suppose–or, by one of your estimates, 00,000? The
greater part of the first debts to me is in notes paying 6 percent. The
rest (the old 0,000 or whatever it is) pays no interest.</p>
<p>Now then, will Harper or Appleton, or Putnam give me 00,000 for those
debts and my two-thirds interest in the firm? (The firm of course taking
the Mount Morris and all such obligations off my hands and leaving me
clear of all responsibility.)</p>
<p>I don’t want much money. I only want first class notes–00,000 worth
of them at 6 per cent, payable monthly;–yearly notes, renewable annually
for 3 years, with ,000 of the principal payable at the beginning and
middle of each year. After that, the notes renewable annually and
(perhaps) a larger part of the principal payable semi-annually.</p>
<p>Please advise me and suggest alterations and emendations of the above
scheme, for I need that sort of help, being ignorant of business and not
able to learn a single detail of it.</p>
<p>Such a deal would make it easy for a big firm to pour in a big cash
capital and jump L. A. L. up to enormous prosperity. Then your one-third
would be a fortune–and I hope to see that day!</p>
<p>I enclose an authority to use with Whitmore in case you have sold any
royalties. But if you can’t make this deal don’t make any. Wait a little
and see if you can’t make the deal. Do make the deal if you possibly
can. And if any presence shall be necessary in order to complete it I
will come over, though I hope it can be done without that.</p>
<p>Get me out of business!</p>
<p>And I will be yours forever gratefully, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>My idea is, that I am offering my 2/3 of L. A. L. and the business
for thirty or forty thousand dollars. Is that it?</p>
<p>P. S. S. The new firm could retain my books and reduce them to a 10
percent royalty. S. L. C.</p>
<p>To Rev. Jos. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>VILLA VIVIANI, SETTIGNANO (FLORENCE) June 9, ’93. DEAR JOE,–The sea
voyage set me up and I reached here May 27 in tolerable
condition–nothing left but weakness, cough all gone.</p>
<p>Old Sir Henry Layard was here the other day, visiting our neighbor
Janet Ross, daughter of Lady Duff Gordon, and since then I have been
reading his account of the adventures of his youth in the far East. In a
footnote he has something to say about a sailor which I thought might
interest you–viz:</p>
<p>“This same quartermaster was celebrated among the English in
Mesopotamia for an entry which he made in his log-book-after a perilous
storm; ‘The windy and watery elements raged. Tears and prayers was had
recourse to, but was of no manner of use. So we hauled up the anchor and
got round the point.’“</p>
<p>There–it isn’t Ned Wakeman; it was before his day.</p>
<p>With love, MARK.</p>
<p>They closed Villa Viviani in June and near the end of the month
arrived in Munich in order that Mrs. Clemens might visit some of the
German baths. The next letter is written by her and shows her deep
sympathy with Hall in his desperate struggle. There have been few more
unselfish and courageous women in history than Mark Twain’s wife.</p>
<p>From Mrs. Clemens to Mr. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>June 27th 1893 MUNICH. DEAR MR. HALL,–Your letter to Mr. Clemens of
June 16th has just reached here; as he has gone to Berlin for Clara I am
going to send you just a line in answer to it.</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens did not realize what trouble you would be in when his
letter should reach you or he would not have sent it just then. I hope
you will not worry any more than you can help. Do not let our interests
weigh on you too heavily. We both know you will, as you always have,
look in every way to the best interests of all.</p>
<p>I think Mr. Clemens is right in feeling that he should get out of
business, that he is not fitted for it; it worries him too much.</p>
<p>But he need be in no haste about it, and of course, it would be the
very farthest from his desire to imperil, in the slightest degree, your
interests in order to save his own.</p>
<p>I am sure that I voice his wish as well as mine when I say that he
would simply like you to bear in mind the fact that he greatly desires
to be released from his present anxiety and worry, at a time when it
shall not endanger your interest or the safety of the business.</p>
<p>I am more sorry than I can express that this letter of Mr. Clemens’
should have reached you when you were struggling under such terrible
pressure. I hope now that the weight is not quite so heavy. He would not
have written you about the money if he had known that it was an
inconvenience for you to send it. He thought the book-keeper whose duty
it is to forward it had forgotten.</p>
<p>We can draw on Mr. Langdon for money for a few weeks until things are
a little easier with you. As Mr. Clemens wrote you we would say “do not
send us any more money at present“ if we were not afraid to do so. I
will say, however, do not trouble yourself if for a few weeks you are
not able to send the usual amount.</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens and I have the greatest possible desire, not to increase
in any way your burdens, and sincerely wish we might aid you.</p>
<p>I trust my brother may be able, in his talk with you, to throw some
helpful light on the situation.</p>
<p>Hoping you will see a change for the better and begin to reap the
fruit of your long and hard labor. Believe me Very Cordially yours
OLIVIA L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Hall, naturally, did not wish to be left alone with the business. He
realized that his credit would suffer, both at the bank and with the
public, if his distinguished partner should retire. He wrote, therefore,
proposing as an alternate that they dispose of the big subscription set
that was swamping them. It was a good plan–if it would work–and we find
Clemens entering into it heartily.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>MUNICH, July 3, ’93. DEAR MR. HALL,–You make a suggestion which has
once or twice flitted dimly through my mind heretofore to wit, sell L.
A. L.</p>
<p>I like that better than the other scheme, for it is no doubt
feasible, whereas the other is perhaps not.</p>
<p>The firm is in debt, but L. A. L. is free–and not only free but has
large money owing to it. A proposition to sell that by itself to a big
house could be made without embarrassment we merely confess that we
cannot spare capital from the rest of the business to run it on the huge
scale necessary to make it an opulent success.</p>
<p>It will be selling a good thing–for somebody; and it will be getting
rid of a load which we are clearly not able to carry. Whoever buys will
have a noble good opening–a complete equipment, a well organized
business, a capable and experienced manager, and enterprise not
experimental but under full sail, and immediately able to pay 50 per
cent a year on every dollar the publisher shall actually invest in it–I
mean in making and selling the books.</p>
<p>I am miserably sorry to be adding bothers and torments to the
over-supply which you already have in these hideous times, but I feel so
troubled, myself, considering the dreary fact that we are getting deeper
and deeper in debt and the L. A. L. getting to be a heavier and heavier
burden all the time, that I must bestir myself and seek a way of
relief.</p>
<p>It did not occur to me that in selling out I would injure you–for
that I am not going to do. But to sell L. A. L. will not injure you it
will put you in better shape. Sincerely Yours S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>July 8, ’92. DEAR MR. HALL,–I am sincerely glad you are going to sell
L. A. L. I am glad you are shutting off the agents, and I hope the fatal
book will be out of our hands before it will be time to put them on
again. With nothing but our non-existent capital to work with the book
has no value for us, rich a prize as it will be to any competent house
that gets it.</p>
<p>I hope you are making an effort to sell before you discharge too many
agents, for I suppose the agents are a valuable part of the
property.</p>
<p>We have been stopping in Munich for awhile, but we shall make a break
for some country resort in a few days now. Sincerely Yours S. L. C.</p>
<p>July 8 P. S. No, I suppose I am wrong in suggesting that you wait a
moment before discharging your L. A. L. agents–in fact I didn’t mean
that. I judge your only hope of salvation is in discharging them all at
once, since it is their commissions that threaten to swamp us. It is
they who have eaten up the 4,000 I left with you in such a brief time,
no doubt.</p>
<p>I feel panicky.</p>
<p>I think the sale might be made with better advantage, however, now,
than later when the agents have got out of the purchaser’s reach. S. L.
C.</p>
<p>P. S. No monthly report for many months.</p>
<p>Those who are old enough to remember the summer of 1893 may recall it
as a black financial season. Banks were denying credit, businesses were
forced to the wall. It was a poor time to float any costly enterprise.
The Chicago company who was trying to build the machines made little
progress. The book business everywhere was bad. In a brief note
following the foregoing letters Clemens wrote Hall:</p>
<p>“It is now past the middle of July and no cablegram to say the
machine is finished. We are afraid you are having miserable days and
worried nights, and we sincerely wish we could relieve you, but it is
all black with us and we don’t know any helpful thing to say or do.“</p>
<p>He inclosed some kind of manuscript proposition for John Brisben
Walker, of the Cosmopolitan, with the comment: “It is my ingenious
scheme to protect the family against the alms-house for one more
year–and after that–well, goodness knows! I have never felt so desperate
in my life–and good reason, for I haven’t got a penny to my name, and
Mrs. Clemens hasn’t enough laid up with Langdon to keep us two
months.“</p>
<p>It was like Mark Twain, in the midst of all this turmoil, to project
an entirely new enterprise; his busy mind was always visioning success
in unusual undertakings, regardless of immediate conditions and the
steps necessary to achievement.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>July 26, ’93. DEAR MR. HALL,–….. I hope the machine will be finished
this month; but it took me four years and cost me 00,000 to finish the
other machine after it was apparently entirely complete and setting type
like a house-afire.</p>
<p>I wonder what they call “finished.“ After it is absolutely perfect it
can’t go into a printing-office until it has had a month’s wear, running
night and day, to get the bearings smooth, I judge.</p>
<p>I may be able to run over about mid-October. Then if I find you
relieved of L. A. L. we will start a magazine inexpensive, and of an
entirely unique sort. Arthur Stedman and his father editors of it.
Arthur could do all the work, merely submitting it to his father for
approval.</p>
<p>The first number should pay–and all subsequent ones–25 cents a
number. Cost of first number (20,000 copies) ,000. Give most of them
away, sell the rest. Advertising and other expenses–cost unknown. Send
one to all newspapers–it would get a notice–favorable, too.</p>
<p>But we cannot undertake it until L. A. L, is out of the way. With our
hands free and some capital to spare, we could make it hum.</p>
<p>Where is the Shelley article? If you have it on hand, keep it and I
will presently tell you what to do with it.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to tell me. Yours Sincerely S. L. C.</p>
<p>The Shelley article mentioned in this letter was the “Defense of
Harriet Sheller,“ one of the very best of his essays. How he could have
written this splendid paper at a time of such distraction passes
comprehension. Furthermore, it is clear that he had revised, indeed
rewritten, the long story of Pudd’nhead Wilson.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>July 30, ’93. DEAR MR. HALL,–This time “Pudd’nhead Wilson“ is a
success! Even Mrs. Clemens, the most difficult of critics, confesses it,
and without reserves or qualifications. Formerly she would not consent
that it be published either before or after my death. I have pulled the
twins apart and made two individuals of them; I have sunk them out of
sight, they are mere flitting shadows, now, and of no importance; their
story has disappeared from the book. Aunt Betsy Hale has vanished
wholly, leaving not a trace behind; aunt Patsy Cooper and her daughter
Rowena have almost disappeared–they scarcely walk across the stage. The
whole story is centered on the murder and the trial; from the first
chapter the movement is straight ahead without divergence or side-play
to the murder and the trial; everything that is done or said or that
happens is a preparation for those events. Therefore, 3 people stand up
high, from beginning to end, and only 3–Pudd’nhead, “Tom“ Driscoll, and
his nigger mother, Roxana; none of the others are important, or get in
the way of the story or require the reader’s attention. Consequently,
the scenes and episodes which were the strength of the book formerly are
stronger than ever, now.</p>
<p>When I began this final reconstruction the story contained 81,500
words, now it contains only 58,000. I have knocked out everything that
delayed the march of the story–even the description of a Mississippi
steamboat. There’s no weather in, and no scenery–the story is stripped
for flight!</p>
<p>Now, then what is she worth? The amount of matter is but 3,000 words
short of the American Claimant, for which the syndicate paid 2,500.
There was nothing new in that story, but the finger-prints in this one
is virgin ground–absolutely fresh, and mighty curious and interesting to
everybody.</p>
<p>I don’t want any more syndicating–nothing short of 0,000, anyway, and
that I can’t get–but won’t you see how much the Cosmopolitan will
stand?</p>
<p>Do your best for me, for I do not sleep these nights, for visions of
the poor-house.</p>
<p>This in spite of the hopeful tone of yours of 11th to Langdon (just
received) for in me hope is very nearly expiring. Everything does look
so blue, so dismally blue!</p>
<p>By and by I shall take up the Rhone open-boat voyage again, but not
now –we are going to be moving around too much. I have torn up some of
it, but still have 15,000 words that Mrs. Clemens approves of, and that
I like. I may go at it in Paris again next winter, but not unless I know
I can write it to suit me.</p>
<p>Otherwise I shall tackle Adam once more, and do him in a kind of a
friendly and respectful way that will commend him to the Sunday schools.
I’ve been thinking out his first life-days to-day and framing his
childish and ignorant impressions and opinions for him.</p>
<p>Will ship Pudd’nhead in a few days. When you get it cable</p>
<p>Mark Twain Care Brownship, London Received.</p>
<p>I mean to ship “Pudd’nhead Wilson“ to you-say, tomorrow. It’ll
furnish me hash for awhile I reckon. I am almost sorry it is finished;
it was good entertainment to work at it, and kept my mind away from
things.</p>
<p>We leave here in about ten days, but the doctors have changed our
plans again. I think we shall be in Bohemia or thereabouts till near the
end of September, then go to Paris and take a rest. Yours Sincerely S.
L. C.</p>
<p>P. S. Mrs. Clemens has come in since, and read your letter and is
deeply distressed. She thinks that in some letter of mine I must have
reproached you. She says it is wonderful that you have kept the ship
afloat in this storm that has seen fleets and fleets go down; that from
what she learns of the American business-situation from her home letters
you have accomplished a marvel in the circumstances, and that she cannot
bear to have a word said to you that shall voice anything but praise and
the heartiest appreciation–and not the shadow of a reproach will she
allow.</p>
<p>I tell her I didn’t reproach you and never thought of such a thing.
And I said I would break open my letter and say so.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens says I must tell you not to send any money for a month
or two–so that you may be afforded what little relief is in our power.
All right–I’m willing; (this is honest) but I wish Brer Chatto would
send along his little yearly contribution. I dropped him a line about
another matter a week ago–asked him to subscribe for the Daily News for
me–you see I wanted to remind him in a covert way that it was pay-up
time–but doubtless I directed the letter to you or some one else, for I
don’t hear from him and don’t get any Daily News either.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>Aug. 6, ’93. DEAR MR. HALL,–I am very sorry–it was thoughtless in me.
Let the reports go. Send me once a month two items, and two only:</p>
<p>Cash liabilities–(so much) Cash assets–(so much)</p>
<p>I can perceive the condition of the business at a glance, then, and
that will be sufficient.</p>
<p>Here we never see a newspaper, but even if we did I could not come
anywhere near appreciating or correctly estimating the tempest you have
been buffeting your way through–only the man who is in it can do that
–but I have tried not to burden you thoughtlessly or wantonly. I have
been wrought and unsettled in mind by apprehensions, and that is a thing
that is not helpable when one is in a strange land and sees his
resources melt down to a two months’ supply and can’t see any sure
daylight beyond. The bloody machine offered but a doubtful outlook–and
will still offer nothing much better for a long time to come; for when
Davis’s “three weeks“ is up there’s three months’ tinkering to follow I
guess. That is unquestionably the boss machine of the world, but is the
toughest one on prophets, when it is in an incomplete state, that has
ever seen the light. Neither Davis nor any other man can foretell with
any considerable approach to certainty when it will be ready to get down
to actual work in a printing office.</p>
<p>[No signature.]</p>
<p>Three days after the foregoing letter was written he wrote,
briefly:</p>
<p>“Great Scott but it’s a long year-for you and me! I never knew the
almanac to drag so. At least since I was finishing that other
machine.</p>
<p>“I watch for your letters hungrily–just as I used to watch for the
cablegram saying the machine’s finished; but when ‘next week certainly’
swelled into ‘three weeks sure’ I recognized the old familiar tune I
used to hear so much. Ward don’t know what sick-heartedness is–but he is
in a way to find out.“</p>
<p>Always the quaint form of his humor, no matter how dark the way. We
may picture him walking the floor, planning, scheming, and
smoking–always smoking–trying to find a way out. It was not the kind of
scheming that many men have done under the circumstances; not scheming
to avoid payment of debts, but to pay them.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>Aug. 14, ’93 DEAR MR. HALL,–I am very glad indeed if you and
Mr. Langdon are able to see any daylight ahead. To me none is visible. I
strongly advise that every penny that comes in shall be applied to
paying off debts. I may be in error about this, but it seems to me that
we have no other course open. We can pay a part of the debts owing to
outsiders–none to the Clemenses. In very prosperous times we might
regard our stock and copyrights as assets sufficient, with the money
owing to us, to square up and quit even, but I suppose we may not hope
for such luck in the present condition of things.</p>
<p>What I am mainly hoping for, is to save my royalties. If they come
into danger I hope you will cable me, so that I can come over and try to
save them, for if they go I am a beggar.</p>
<p>I would sail to-day if I had anybody to take charge of my family and
help them through the difficult journeys commanded by the doctors. I may
be able to sail ten days hence; I hope so, and expect so.</p>
<p>We can never resurrect the L. A. L. I would not spend any more money
on that book. You spoke, a while back, of trying to start it up again as
a preparation to disposing of it, but we are not in shape to venture
that, I think. It would require more borrowing, and we must not do that.
Yours Sincerely S. L. C.</p>
<p>Aug. 16. I have thought, and thought, but I don’t seem to arrive in
any very definite place. Of course you will not have an instant’s safety
until the bank debts are paid. There is nothing to be thought of but to
hand over every penny as fast as it comes in–and that will be slow
enough! Or could you secure them by pledging part of our cash assets
and–</p>
<p>I am coming over, just as soon as I can get the family moved and
settled. S. L. C.</p>
<p>Two weeks following this letter he could endure the suspense no
longer, and on August 29th sailed once more for America. In New York,
Clemens settled down at the Players Club, where he could live cheaply,
and undertook some literary work while he was casting about for ways and
means to relieve the financial situation. Nothing promising occurred,
until one night at the Murray Hill Hotel he was introduced by
Dr. Clarence C. Rice to Henry H. Rogers, of the Standard Oil group of
financiers. Rogers had a keen sense of humor and had always been a great
admirer of Mark Twain’s work. It was a mirthful evening, and certainly
an eventful one in Mark Twain’s life. A day or two later Doctor Rice
asked the millionaire to interest himself a little in Clemens’s business
affairs, which he thought a good deal confused. Just what happened is
not remembered now, but from the date of the next letter we realize that
a discussion of the matter by Clemens and Rogers must have followed
pretty promptly.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Europe:</p>
<p>Oct. 18, ’93. DEAR, DEAR SWEETHEART,–I don’t seem to get even half a
chance to write you, these last two days, and yet there’s lots to
say.</p>
<p>Apparently everything is at last settled as to the giveaway of L. A.
L., and the papers will be signed and the transfer made to-morrow
morning.</p>
<p>Meantime I have got the best and wisest man in the whole Standard Oil
group of mufti-millionaires a good deal interested in looking into the
type-setter (this is private, don’t mention it.) He has been searching
into that thing for three weeks, and yesterday he said to me, “I find
the machine to be all you represented it–I have here exhaustive reports
from my own experts, and I know every detail of its capacity, its
immense value, its construction, cost, history, and all about its
inventor’s character. I know that the New York Co. and the Chicago
Co. are both stupid, and that they are unbusinesslike people, destitute
of money and in a hopeless boggle.“</p>
<p>Then he told me the scheme he had planned, then said: “If I can
arrange with these people on this basis–it will take several weeks to
find out –I will see to it that they get the money they need. Then the
thing will move right along and your royalties will cease to be waste
paper. I will post you the minute my scheme fails or succeeds. In the
meantime, you stop walking the floor. Go off to the country and try to
be gay. You may have to go to walking again, but don’t begin till I tell
you my scheme has failed.“ And he added: “Keep me posted always as to
where you are–for if I need you and can use you–I want to know where to
put my hand on you.“</p>
<p>If I should even divulge the fact that the Standard Oil is merely
talking remotely about going into the type-setter, it would send my
royalties up.</p>
<p>With worlds and worlds of love and kisses to you all, SAML.</p>
<p>With so great a burden of care shifted to the broad financial
shoulders of H. H. Rogers, Mark Twain’s spirits went ballooning, soaring
toward the stars. He awoke, too, to some of the social gaieties about
him, and found pleasure in the things that in the hour of his gloom had
seemed mainly mockery. We find him going to a Sunday evening at
Howells’s, to John Mackay’s, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Paris:</p>
<p>Dec. 2, ’93. LIVY DARLING,–Last night at John Mackay’s the dinner
consisted of soup, raw oysters, corned beef and cabbage, and something
like a custard. I ate without fear or stint, and yet have escaped all
suggestion of indigestion. The men present were old gray
Pacific-coasters whom I knew when I and they were young and not gray.
The talk was of the days when we went gypsying a long time ago–thirty
years. Indeed it was a talk of the dead. Mainly that. And of how they
looked, and the harum-scarum things they did and said. For there were no
cares in that life, no aches and pains, and not time enough in the day
(and three-fourths of the night) to work off one’s surplus vigor and
energy. Of the mid-night highway robbery joke played upon me with
revolvers at my head on the windswept and desolate Gold Hill Divide, no
witness is left but me, the victim. All the friendly robbers are gone.
These old fools last night laughed till they cried over the particulars
of that old forgotten crime.</p>
<p>John Mackay has no family here but a pet monkey–a most affectionate
and winning little devil. But he makes trouble for the servants, for he
is full of curiosity and likes to take everything out of the drawers and
examine it minutely; and he puts nothing back. The examinations of
yesterday count for nothing to-day–he makes a new examination every day.
But he injures nothing.</p>
<p>I went with Laffan to the Racquet Club the other night and played,
billiards two hours without starting up any rheumatism. I suppose it was
all really taken out of me in Berlin.</p>
<p>Richard Harding Davis spoke yesterday of Clara’s impersonations at
Mrs. Van Rensselaer’s here and said they were a wonderful piece of
work.</p>
<p>Livy dear, I do hope you are comfortable, as to quarters and food at
the Hotel Brighton. But if you’re not don’t stay there. Make one more
effort–don’t give it up. Dear heart, this is from one who loves you
–which is Saml.</p>
<p>It was decided that Rogers and Clemens should make a trip to Chicago
to investigate personally the type-setter situation there. Clemens
reports the details of the excursion to Mrs. Clemens in a long
subdivided letter, most of which has no general interest and is here
omitted. The trip, as a whole, would seem to have been satisfactory. The
personal portions of the long Christmas letter may properly be
preserved.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Paris:</p>
<p>THE PLAYERS, Xmas, 1893. No. 1. Merry Xmas, my darling, and all my
darlings! I arrived from Chicago close upon midnight last night, and
wrote and sent down my Christmas cablegram before undressing: “Merry
Xmas! Promising progress made in Chicago.“ It would get to the telegraph
office toward 8 this morning and reach you at luncheon.</p>
<p>I was vaguely hoping, all the past week, that my Xmas cablegram would
be definite, and make you all jump with jubilation; but the thought
always intruded itself, “You are not going out there to negotiate with a
man, but with a louse. This makes results uncertain.“</p>
<p>I was asleep as Christmas struck upon the clock at mid night, and
didn’t wake again till two hours ago. It is now half past 10 Xmas
morning; I have had my coffee and bread, and shan’t get out of bed till
it is time to dress for Mrs. Laflan’s Christmas dinner this
evening–where I shall meet Bram Stoker and must make sure about that
photo with Irving’s autograph. I will get the picture and he will attend
to the rest. In order to remember and not forget–well, I will go there
with my dress coat wrong side out; it will cause remark and then I shall
remember.</p>
<p>No. 2 and 3. I tell you it was interesting! The Chicago campaign, I
mean. On the way out Mr. Rogers would plan out the campaign while I
walked the floor and smoked and assented. Then he would close it up with
a snap and drop it and we would totally change the subject and take up
the scenery, etc.</p>
<p>(Here follows the long detailed report of the Chicago conference, of
interest only to the parties directly concerned.)</p>
<p>No. 4. We had nice tripe, going and coming. Mr. Rogers had
telegraphed the Pennsylvania Railroad for a couple of sections for us in
the fast train leaving at 2 p. m. the 22nd. The Vice President
telegraphed back that every berth was engaged (which was not true–it
goes without saying) but that he was sending his own car for us. It was
mighty nice and comfortable. In its parlor it had two sofas, which could
become beds at night. It had four comfortably-cushioned cane arm-chairs.
It had a very nice bedroom with a wide bed in it; which I said I would
take because I believed I was a little wider than Mr. Rogers–which
turned out to be true; so I took it. It had a darling back-porch–railed,
roofed and roomy; and there we sat, most of the time, and viewed the
scenery and talked, for the weather was May weather, and the soft
dream-pictures of hill and river and mountain and sky were clear and
away beyond anything I have ever seen for exquisiteness and
daintiness.</p>
<p>The colored waiter knew his business, and the colored cook was a
finished artist. Breakfasts: coffee with real cream; beefsteaks,
sausage, bacon, chops, eggs in various ways, potatoes in various–yes,
and quite wonderful baked potatoes, and hot as fire. Dinners–all manner
of things, including canvas-back duck, apollinaris, claret, champagne,
etc.</p>
<p>We sat up chatting till midnight, going and coming; seldom read a
line, day or night, though we were well fixed with magazines, etc.; then
I finished off with a hot Scotch and we went to bed and slept till
9.30a.m. I honestly tried to pay my share of hotel bills, fees, etc.,
but I was not allowed–and I knew the reason why, and respected the
motive. I will explain when I see you, and then you will understand.</p>
<p>We were 25 hours going to Chicago; we were there 24 hours; we were 30
hours returning. Brisk work, but all of it enjoyable. We insisted on
leaving the car at Philadelphia so that our waiter and cook (to whom
Mr. R. gave 0 apiece,) could have their Christmas-eve at home.</p>
<p>Mr. Rogers’s carriage was waiting for us in Jersey City and deposited
me at the Players. There–that’s all. This letter is to make up for the
three letterless days. I love you, dear heart, I love you all. SAML.</p>
