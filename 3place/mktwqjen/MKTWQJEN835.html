<h4 id="advice-to-little-girls">ADVICE TO LITTLE GIRLS</h4>
<p>Good little girls ought not to make mouths at their teachers for
every trifling offense. This retaliation should only be resorted to
under peculiarly aggravated circumstances.</p>
<p>If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust, while one of
your more fortunate little playmates has a costly China one, you should
treat her with a show of kindness nevertheless. And you ought not to
attempt to make a forcible swap with her unless your conscience would
justify you in it, and you know you are able to do it.</p>
<p>You ought never to take your little brother’s “chewing-gum“ away from
him by main force; it is better to rope him in with the promise of the
first two dollars and a half you find floating down the river on a
grindstone. In the artless simplicity natural to this time of life, he
will regard it as a perfectly fair transaction. In all ages of the world
this eminently plausible fiction has lured the obtuse infant to
financial ruin and disaster.</p>
<p>If at any time you find it necessary to correct your brother, do not
correct him with mud–never, on any account, throw mud at him, because it
will spoil his clothes. It is better to scald him a little, for then you
obtain desirable results. You secure his immediate attention to the
lessons you are inculcating, and at the same time your hot water will
have a tendency to move impurities from his person, and possibly the
skin, in spots.</p>
<p>If your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to reply that you
won’t. It is better and more becoming to intimate that you will do as
she bids you, and then afterward act quietly in the matter according to
the dictates of your best judgment.</p>
<p>You should ever bear in mind that it is to your kind parents that you
are indebted for your food, and for the privilege of staying home from
school when you let on that you are sick. Therefore you ought to respect
their little prejudices, and humor their little whims, and put up with
their little foibles until they get to crowding you too much.</p>
<p>Good little girls always show marked deference for the aged. You
ought never to “sass“ old people unless they “sass“ you first.</p>
<p>POST-MORTEM POETRY [1]</p>
<p>In Philadelphia they have a custom which it would be pleasant to see
adopted throughout the land. It is that of appending to published
death-notices a little verse or two of comforting poetry. Any one who is
in the habit of reading the daily Philadelphia LEDGER must frequently be
touched by these plaintive tributes to extinguished worth. In
Philadelphia, the departure of a child is a circumstance which is not
more surely followed by a burial than by the accustomed solacing poesy
in the PUBLIC LEDGER. In that city death loses half its terror because
the knowledge of its presence comes thus disguised in the sweet drapery
of verse. For instance, in a late LEDGER I find the following (I change
the surname):</p>
<p>DIED</p>
<p>Hawks.–On the 17th inst., Clara, the daughter of Ephraim and Laura
Hawks, aged 21 months and 2 days.</p>
<p>That merry shout no more I hear, No laughing child I see, No little
arms are around my neck, No feet upon my knee;</p>
<p>No kisses drop upon my cheek, These lips are sealed to me. Dear Lord,
how could I give Clara up To any but to Thee?</p>
<p>A child thus mourned could not die wholly discontented. From the
LEDGER of the same date I make the following extract, merely changing
the surname, as before:</p>
<p>Becket.–On Sunday morning, 19th inst., John P., infant son of George
and Julia Becket, aged 1 year, 6 months, and 15 days.</p>
<p>That merry shout no more I hear, No laughing child I see, No little
arms are round my neck, No feet upon my knee;</p>
<p>No kisses drop upon my cheek; These lips are sealed to me. Dear Lord,
how could I give Johnnie up To any but to Thee?</p>
<p>The similarity of the emotions as produced in the mourners in these
two instances is remarkably evidenced by the singular similarity of
thought which they experienced, and the surprising coincidence of
language used by them to give it expression.</p>
<p>In the same journal, of the same date, I find the following (surname
suppressed, as before):</p>
<p>Wagner.–On the 10th inst., Ferguson G., the son of William L. and
Martha Theresa Wagner, aged 4 weeks and 1 day.</p>
<p>That merry shout no more I hear, No laughing child I see, No little
arms are round my neck, No feet upon my knee;</p>
<p>No kisses drop upon my cheek, These lips are sealed to me. Dear Lord,
how could I give Ferguson up To any but to Thee?</p>
<p>It is strange what power the reiteration of an essentially poetical
thought has upon one’s feelings. When we take up the LEDGER and read the
poetry about little Clara, we feel an unaccountable depression of the
spirits. When we drift further down the column and read the poetry about
little Johnnie, the depression and spirits acquires and added emphasis,
and we experience tangible suffering. When we saunter along down the
column further still and read the poetry about little Ferguson, the word
torture but vaguely suggests the anguish that rends us.</p>
<p>In the LEDGER (same copy referred to above) I find the following (I
alter surname, as usual):</p>
<p>Welch.–On the 5th inst., Mary C. Welch, wife of William B. Welch, and
daughter of Catharine and George W. Markland, in the 29th year of her
age.</p>
<p>A mother dear, a mother kind, Has gone and left us all behind. Cease
to weep, for tears are vain, Mother dear is out of pain.</p>
<p>Farewell, husband, children dear, Serve thy God with filial fear, And
meet me in the land above, Where all is peace, and joy, and love.</p>
<p>What could be sweeter than that? No collection of salient facts
(without reduction to tabular form) could be more succinctly stated than
is done in the first stanza by the surviving relatives, and no more
concise and comprehensive program of farewells, post-mortuary general
orders, etc., could be framed in any form than is done in verse by
deceased in the last stanza. These things insensibly make us wiser and
tenderer, and better. Another extract:</p>
<p>Ball.–On the morning of the 15th inst., Mary E., daughter of John and
Sarah F. Ball.</p>
<p>’Tis sweet to rest in lively hope That when my change shall come
Angels will hover round my bed, To waft my spirit home.</p>
<p>The following is apparently the customary form for heads of
families:</p>
<p>Burns.–On the 20th inst., Michael Burns, aged 40 years.</p>
<p>Dearest father, thou hast left us, Hear thy loss we deeply feel; But
’tis God that has bereft us, He can all our sorrows heal.</p>
<p>Funeral at 2 o’clock sharp.</p>
<p>There is something very simple and pleasant about the following,
which, in Philadelphia, seems to be the usual form for consumptives of
long standing. (It deplores four distinct cases in the single copy of
the LEDGER which lies on the Memoranda editorial table):</p>
<p>Bromley.–On the 29th inst., of consumption, Philip Bromley, in the
50th year of his age.</p>
<p>Affliction sore long time he bore, Physicians were in vain– Till God
at last did hear him mourn, And eased him of his pain.</p>
<p>That friend whom death from us has torn, We did not think so soon to
part; An anxious care now sinks the thorn Still deeper in our bleeding
heart.</p>
<p>This beautiful creation loses nothing by repetition. On the contrary,
the oftener one sees it in the LEDGER, the more grand and awe-inspiring
it seems.</p>
<p>With one more extract I will close:</p>
<p>Doble.–On the 4th inst., Samuel Pervil Worthington Doble, aged 4
days.</p>
<p>Our little Sammy’s gone, His tiny spirit’s fled; Our little boy we
loved so dear Lies sleeping with the dead.</p>
<p>A tear within a father’s eye, A mother’s aching heart, Can only tell
the agony How hard it is to part.</p>
<p>Could anything be more plaintive than that, without requiring further
concessions of grammar? Could anything be likely to do more toward
reconciling deceased to circumstances, and making him willing to go?
Perhaps not. The power of song can hardly be estimated. There is an
element about some poetry which is able to make even physical suffering
and death cheerful things to contemplate and consummations to be
desired. This element is present in the mortuary poetry of Philadelphia
degree of development.</p>
<p>The custom I have been treating of is one that should be adopted in
all the cities of the land.</p>
<p>It is said that once a man of small consequence died, and the Rev. T.
K. Beecher was asked to preach the funeral sermon –a man who abhors the
lauding of people, either dead or alive, except in dignified and simple
language, and then only for merits which they actually possessed or
possess, not merits which they merely ought to have possessed. The
friends of the deceased got up a stately funeral. They must have had
misgivings that the corpse might not be praised strongly enough, for
they prepared some manuscript headings and notes in which nothing was
left unsaid on that subject that a fervid imagination and an unabridged
dictionary could compile, and these they handed to the minister as he
entered the pulpit. They were merely intended as suggestions, and so the
friends were filled with consternation when the minister stood in the
pulpit and proceeded to read off the curious odds and ends in ghastly
detail and in a loud voice! And their consternation solidified to
petrification when he paused at the end, contemplated the multitude
reflectively, and then said, impressively:</p>
<p>“The man would be a fool who tried to add anything to that. Let us
pray!“</p>
<p>And with the same strict adhesion to truth it can be said that the
man would be a fool who tried to add anything to the following
transcendent obituary poem. There is something so innocent, so
guileless, so complacent, so unearthly serene and self-satisfied about
this peerless “hog-wash,“ that the man must be made of stone who can
read it without a dulcet ecstasy creeping along his backbone and
quivering in his marrow. There is no need to say that this poem is
genuine and in earnest, for its proofs are written all over its face. An
ingenious scribbler might imitate it after a fashion, but Shakespeare
himself could not counterfeit it. It is noticeable that the country
editor who published it did not know that it was a treasure and the most
perfect thing of its kind that the storehouses and museums of literature
could show. He did not dare to say no to the dread poet–for such a poet
must have been something of an apparition–but he just shoveled it into
his paper anywhere that came handy, and felt ashamed, and put that
disgusted “Published by Request“ over it, and hoped that his subscribers
would overlook it or not feel an impulse to read it:</p>
<p>(Published by Request)</p>
<p>LINES</p>
<p>Composed on the death of Samuel and Catharine Belknap’s children</p>
<p>by M. A. Glaze</p>
<p>Friends and neighbors all draw near, And listen to what I have to
say; And never leave your children dear When they are small, and go
away.</p>
<p>But always think of that sad fate, That happened in year of ’63; Four
children with a house did burn, Think of their awful agony.</p>
<p>Their mother she had gone away, And left them there alone to stay;
The house took fire and down did burn; Before their mother did
return.</p>
<p>Their piteous cry the neighbors heard, And then the cry of fire was
given; But, ah! before they could them reach, Their little spirits had
flown to heaven.</p>
<p>Their father he to war had gone, And on the battle-field was slain;
But little did he think when he went away, But what on earth they would
meet again.</p>
<p>The neighbors often told his wife Not to leave his children there,
Unless she got some one to stay, And of the little ones take care.</p>
<p>The oldest he was years not six, And the youngest only eleven months
old, But often she had left them there alone, As, by the neighbors, I
have been told.</p>
<p>How can she bear to see the place. Where she so oft has left them
there, Without a single one to look to them, Or of the little ones to
take good care.</p>
<p>Oh, can she look upon the spot, Whereunder their little burnt bones
lay, But what she thinks she hears them say, ‘’Twas God had pity, and
took us on high.’</p>
<p>And there may she kneel down and pray, And ask God her to forgive;
And she may lead a different life While she on earth remains to
live.</p>
<p>Her husband and her children too, God has took from pain and woe. May
she reform and mend her ways, That she may also to them go.</p>
<p>And when it is God’s holy will, O, may she be prepared To meet her
God and friends in peace, And leave this world of care.</p>
