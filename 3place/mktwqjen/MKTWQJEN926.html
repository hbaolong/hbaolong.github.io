A YALE DEGREE. WORK ON “THE YANKEE.“ ON INTERVIEWING, ETC.</h4>
<p>Mark Twain received his first college degree when he was made Master
of Arts by Yale, in June, 1888. Editor of the Courant, Charles H.
Clarke, was selected to notify him of his new title. Clarke was an old
friend to whom Clemens could write familiarly.</p>
<p>To Charles H. Clarke, in Hartford:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, July 2, ’88. MY DEAR CHARLES,–Thanks for your thanks, and for
your initiation intentions. I shall be ready for you. I feel mighty
proud of that degree; in fact, I could squeeze the truth a little closer
and say vain of it. And why shouldn’t I be?–I am the only literary
animal of my particular subspecies who has ever been given a degree by
any College in any age of the world, as far as I know. Sincerely Yours
S. L. Clemens M. A.</p>
<p>Reply: Charles H. Clarke to S. L Clemens:</p>
<p>MY DEAR FRIEND, You are “the only literary animal of your particular
subspecies“ in existence and you’ve no cause for humility in the fact.
Yale has done herself at least as much credit as she has done you, and
“Don’t you forget it.“ C. H. C.</p>
<p>With the exception of his brief return to the river in 1882. Mark
Twain had been twenty-seven years away from pilots and piloting.
Nevertheless, he always kept a tender place in his heart for the old
times and for old river comrades. Major “Jack“ Downing had been a
Mississippi pilot of early days, but had long since retired from the
river to a comfortable life ashore, in an Ohio town. Clemens had not
heard from him for years when a letter came which invited the following
answer.</p>
<p>To Major “Jack“ Downing, in Middleport Ohio:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, N. Y.[no month] 1888. DEAR MAJOR,–And has it come to this
that the dead rise up and speak? For I supposed that you were dead, it
has been so long since I heard your name.</p>
<p>And how young you’ve grown! I was a mere boy when I knew you on the
river, where you had been piloting for 35 years, and now you are only a
year and a half older than I am! I mean to go to Hot Springs myself and
get 30 or 40 years knocked off my age. It’s manifestly the place that
Ponce de Leon was striking for, but the poor fellow lost the trail.</p>
<p>Possibly I may see you, for I shall be in St. Louis a day or two in
November. I propose to go down the river and “note the changes“ once
more before I make the long crossing, and perhaps you can come there.
Will you? I want to see all the boys that are left alive.</p>
<p>And so Grant Marsh, too, is flourishing yet? A mighty good fellow,
and smart too. When we were taking that wood flat down to the Chambers,
which was aground, I soon saw that I was a perfect lubber at piloting
such a thing. I saw that I could never hit the Chambers with it, so I
resigned in Marsh’s favor, and he accomplished the task to my
admiration. We should all have gone to the mischief if I had remained in
authority. I always had good judgement, more judgement than talent, in
fact.</p>
<p>No; the nom de plume did not originate in that way. Capt. Sellers
used the signature, “Mark Twain,“ himself, when he used to write up the
antiquities in the way of river reminiscences for the New Orleans
Picayune. He hated me for burlesquing them in an article in the True
Delta; so four years later when he died, I robbed the corpse–that is I
confiscated the nom de plume. I have published this vital fact 3,000
times now. But no matter, it is good practice; it is about the only fact
that I can tell the same way every time. Very glad, indeed, to hear from
you Major, and shall be gladder still to see you in November.</p>
<p>Truly yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>He did not make the journey down the river planned for that year. He
had always hoped to make another steamboat trip with Bixby, but one
thing and another interfered and he did not go again.</p>
<p>Authors were always sending their books to Mark Twain to read, and no
busy man was ever more kindly disposed toward such offerings, more
generously considerate of the senders. Louis Pendleton was a young
unknown writer in 1888, but Clemens took time to read his story
carefully, and to write to him about it a letter that cost precious
time, thought, and effort. It must have rejoiced the young man’s heart
to receive a letter like that, from one whom all young authors held
supreme.</p>
<p>To Louis Pendleton, in Georgia:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, N. Y., Aug. 4, ’88. MY DEAR SIR,–I found your letter an hour
ago among some others which had lain forgotten a couple of weeks, and I
at once stole time enough to read Ariadne. Stole is the right word, for
the summer “Vacation“ is the only chance I get for work; so, no minute
subtracted from work is borrowed, it is stolen. But this time I do not
repent. As a rule, people don’t send me books which I can thank them
for, and so I say nothing–which looks uncourteous. But I thank you.
Ariadne is a beautiful and satisfying story; and true, too–which is the
best part of a story; or indeed of any other thing. Even liars have to
admit that, if they are intelligent liars; I mean in their private [the
word conscientious written but erased] intervals. (I struck that word
out because a man’s private thought can never be a lie; what he thinks,
is to him the truth, always; what he speaks–but these be
platitudes.)</p>
<p>If you want me to pick some flaws–very well–but I do it unwillingly.
I notice one thing–which one may notice also in my books, and in all
books whether written by man or God: trifling carelessness of statement
or Expression. If I think that you meant that she took the lizard from
the water which she had drawn from the well, it is evidence–it is almost
proof–that your words were not as clear as they should have been. True,
it is only a trifling thing; but so is mist on a mirror. I would have
hung the pail on Ariadne’s arm. You did not deceive me when you said
that she carried it under her arm, for I knew she didn’t; still it was
not your right to mar my enjoyment of the graceful picture. If the pail
had been a portfolio, I wouldn’t be making these remarks. The engraver
of a fine picture revises, and revises, and revises–and then revises,
and revises, and revises; and then repeats. And always the charm of that
picture grows, under his hand. It was good enough before–told its story,
and was beautiful. True: and a lovely girl is lovely, with freckles; but
she isn’t at her level best with them.</p>
<p>This is not hypercriticism; you have had training enough to know
that.</p>
<p>So much concerning exactness of statement. In that other not-small
matter–selection of the exact single word–you are hard to catch. Still,
I should hold that Mrs. Walker considered that there was no occasion for
concealment; that “motive“ implied a deeper mental search than she
expended on the matter; that it doesn’t reflect the attitude of her mind
with precision. Is this hypercriticism? I shan’t dispute it. I only say,
that if Mrs. Walker didn’t go so far as to have a motive, I had to
suggest that when a word is so near the right one that a body can’t
quite tell whether it is or isn’t, it’s good politics to strike it out
and go for the Thesaurus. That’s all. Motive may stand; but you have
allowed a snake to scream, and I will not concede that that was the best
word.</p>
<p>I do not apologize for saying these things, for they are not said in
the speck-hunting spirit, but in the spirit of want-to-help-if-I-can.
They would be useful to me if said to me once a month, they may be
useful to you, said once.</p>
<p>I save the other stories for my real vacation–which is nine months
long, to my sorrow. I thank you again. Truly Yours S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>In the next letter we get a sidelight on the type-setting machine,
the Frankenstein monster that was draining their substance and holding
out false hopes of relief and golden return. The program here outlined
was one that would continue for several years yet, with the end always
in sight, but never quite attained.</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens, in Keokuk, Ia.:</p>
<p>Oct. 3, ’88. Private.</p>
<p>Saturday 29th, by a closely calculated estimate, there were 85 days’
work to do on the machine.</p>
<p>We can use 4 men, but not constantly. If they could work constantly
it would complete the machine in 21 days, of course. They will all be on
hand and under wages, and each will get in all the work there is
opportunity for, but by how much they can reduce the 85 days toward the
21 days, nobody can tell.</p>
<p>To-day I pay Pratt andandandand Whitney 0,000. This squares back
indebtedness and everything to date. They began about May or April or
March 1886–along there somewhere, and have always kept from a dozen to
two dozen master-hands on the machine.</p>
<p>That outgo is done; 4 men for a month or two will close up that leak
and caulk it. Work on the patents is also kind of drawing toward a
conclusion.</p>
<p>Love to you both. All well here.</p>
<p>And give our love to Ma if she can get the idea.</p>
<p>SAM.</p>
<p>Mark Twain that year was working pretty steadily on ‘The Yankee at
King Arthur’s Court’, a book which he had begun two years before. He had
published nothing since the Huck Finn story, and his company was badly
in need of a new book by an author of distinction. Also it was highly
desirable to earn money for himself; wherefore he set to work to finish
the Yankee story. He had worked pretty steadily that summer in his
Elmira study, but on his return to Hartford found a good deal of
confusion in the house, so went over to Twichell’s, where carpenter work
was in progress. He seems to have worked there successfully, though what
improvement of conditions he found in that numerous, lively household,
over those at home it would be difficult to say.</p>
<p>To Theodore W. Crane, at Quarry Farm, Elmira, N. Y.</p>
<p>Friday, Oct.,5, ’88. DEAR THEO,–I am here in Twichell’s house at
work, with the noise of the children and an army of carpenters to help.
Of course they don’t help, but neither do they hinder. It’s like a
boiler-factory for racket, and in nailing a wooden ceiling onto the room
under me the hammering tickles my feet amazingly sometimes, and jars my
table a good deal; but I never am conscious of the racket at all, and I
move my feet into position of relief without knowing when I do it. I
began here Monday morning, and have done eighty pages since. I was so
tired last night that I thought I would lie abed and rest, to-day; but I
couldn’t resist. I mean to try to knock off tomorrow, but it’s doubtful
if I do. I want to finish the day the machine finishes, and a week ago
the closest calculations for that indicated Oct. 22–but experience
teaches me that their calculations will miss fire, as usual.</p>
<p>The other day the children were projecting a purchase, Livy and I to
furnish the money–a dollar and a half. Jean discouraged the idea. She
said: “We haven’t got any money. Children, if you would think, you would
remember the machine isn’t done.“</p>
<p>It’s billiards to-night. I wish you were here. With love to you both
S. L. C.</p>
<p>P. S. I got it all wrong. It wasn’t the children, it was Marie. She
wanted a box of blacking, for the children’s shoes. Jean reproved her
–and said:</p>
<p>“Why, Marie, you mustn’t ask for things now. The machine isn’t
done.“</p>
<p>S. L. C.</p>
<p>The letter that follows is to another of his old pilot friends, one
who was also a schoolmate, Will Bowen, of Hannibal. There is today no
means of knowing the occasion upon which this letter was written, but it
does not matter; it is the letter itself that is of chief value.</p>
<p>To Will Bowen, in Hannibal, Mo.:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Nov 4, ’88. DEAR WILL,–I received your letter yesterday
evening, just as I was starting out of town to attend a wedding, and so
my mind was privately busy, all the evening, in the midst of the
maelstrom of chat and chaff and laughter, with the sort of reflections
which create themselves, examine themselves, and continue themselves,
unaffected by surroundings –unaffected, that is understood, by the
surroundings, but not uninfluenced by them. Here was the near presence
of the two supreme events of life: marriage, which is the beginning of
life, and death which is the end of it. I found myself seeking chances
to shirk into corners where I might think, undisturbed; and the most I
got out of my thought, was this: both marriage and death ought to be
welcome: the one promises happiness, doubtless the other assures it. A
long procession of people filed through my mind–people whom you and I
knew so many years ago–so many centuries ago, it seems like-and these
ancient dead marched to the soft marriage music of a band concealed in
some remote room of the house; and the contented music and the dreaming
shades seemed in right accord with each other, and fitting. Nobody else
knew that a procession of the dead was passing though this noisy swarm
of the living, but there it was, and to me there was nothing uncanny
about it; Rio, they were welcome faces to me. I would have liked to
bring up every creature we knew in those days–even the dumb animals–it
would be bathing in the fabled Fountain of Youth.</p>
<p>We all feel your deep trouble with you; and we would hope, if we
might, but your words deny us that privilege. To die one’s self is a
thing that must be easy, and of light consequence, but to lose a part of
one’s self –well, we know how deep that pang goes, we who have suffered
that disaster, received that wound which cannot heal. Sincerely your
friend S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>His next is of quite a different nature. Evidently the typesetting
conditions had alarmed Orion, and he was undertaking some economies with
a view of retrenchment. Orion was always reducing economy to science.
Once, at an earlier date, he recorded that he had figured his personal
living expenses down to sixty cents a week, but inasmuch as he was then,
by his own confession, unable to earn the sixty cents, this particular
economy was wasted. Orion was a trial, certainly, and the explosion that
follows was not without excuse. Furthermore, it was not as bad as it
sounds. Mark Twain’s rages always had an element of humor in them, a
fact which no one more than Orion himself would appreciate. He preserved
this letter, quietly noting on the envelope, “Letter from Sam, about
ma’s nurse.“</p>
