<h4 id="chapter-iv.-the-princes-troubles-begin.">Chapter IV. The
Prince’s troubles begin.</h4>
<p>After hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince
was at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself. As long as he
had been able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and
royally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very
entertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was
no longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere.
He looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality. He was
within the city of London–that was all he knew. He moved on, aimlessly,
and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by were
infrequent. He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed then
where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed on,
and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered houses
in it, and a prodigious church. He recognised this church. Scaffoldings
were about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was undergoing
elaborate repairs. The prince took heart at once–he felt that his
troubles were at an end, now. He said to himself, “It is the ancient
Grey Friars’ Church, which the king my father hath taken from the monks
and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children, and
new-named it Christ’s Church. Right gladly will they serve the son of
him who hath done so generously by them–and the more that that son is
himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this day,
or ever shall be.“</p>
<p>He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running,
jumping, playing at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting
themselves, and right noisily, too. They were all dressed alike, and in
the fashion which in that day prevailed among serving-men and
’prentices{1}–that is to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat
black cap about the size of a saucer, which was not useful as a
covering, it being of such scanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental;
from beneath it the hair fell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead,
and was cropped straight around; a clerical band at the neck; a blue
gown that fitted closely and hung as low as the knees or lower; full
sleeves; a broad red belt; bright yellow stockings, gartered above the
knees; low shoes with large metal buckles. It was a sufficiently ugly
costume.</p>
<p>The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said
with native dignity–</p>
<p>“Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth
speech with him.“</p>
<p>A great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said–</p>
<p>“Marry, art thou his grace’s messenger, beggar?“</p>
<p>The prince’s face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his
hip, but there was nothing there. There was a storm of laughter, and one
boy said–</p>
<p>“Didst mark that? He fancied he had a sword–belike he is the prince
himself.“</p>
<p>This sally brought more laughter. Poor Edward drew himself up proudly
and said–</p>
<p>“I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my
father’s bounty to use me so.“</p>
<p>This was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified. The youth who had
first spoken, shouted to his comrades–</p>
<p>“Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace’s princely father, where
be your manners? Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence
to his kingly port and royal rags!“</p>
<p>With boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did
mock homage to their prey. The prince spurned the nearest boy with his
foot, and said fiercely–</p>
<p>“Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!“</p>
<p>Ah, but this was not a joke–this was going beyond fun. The laughter
ceased on the instant, and fury took its place. A dozen shouted–</p>
<p>“Hale him forth! To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond! Where be the
dogs? Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!“</p>
<p>Then followed such a thing as England had never seen before–the
sacred person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian
hands, and set upon and torn by dogs.</p>
<p>As night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down
in the close-built portion of the city. His body was bruised, his hands
were bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud. He wandered on
and on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint he
could hardly drag one foot after the other. He had ceased to ask
questions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of
information. He kept muttering to himself, “Offal Court–that is the
name; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I
drop, then am I saved–for his people will take me to the palace and
prove that I am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have
mine own again.“ And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment by
those rude Christ’s Hospital boys, and he said, “When I am king, they
shall not have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books;
for a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the
heart. I will keep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day’s
lesson be not lost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning
softeneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity.“ {1}</p>
<p>The lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a
raw and gusty night set in. The houseless prince, the homeless heir to
the throne of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze of
squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were
massed together.</p>
<p>Suddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said–</p>
<p>“Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing
home, I warrant me! If it be so, an’ I do not break all the bones in thy
lean body, then am I not John Canty, but some other.“</p>
<p>The prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned
shoulder, and eagerly said–</p>
<p>“Oh, art HIS father, truly? Sweet heaven grant it be so–then wilt
thou fetch him away and restore me!“</p>
<p>“HIS father? I know not what thou mean’st; I but know I am THY
father, as thou shalt soon have cause to–“</p>
<p>“Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!–I am worn, I am wounded, I can
bear no more. Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich
beyond thy wildest dreams. Believe me, man, believe me!–I speak no lie,
but only the truth!–put forth thy hand and save me! I am indeed the
Prince of Wales!“</p>
<p>The man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and
muttered–</p>
<p>“Gone stark mad as any Tom o’ Bedlam!“–then collared him once more,
and said with a coarse laugh and an oath, “But mad or no mad, I and thy
Gammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or
I’m no true man!“</p>
<p>With this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and
disappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of
human vermin.</p>
