<h4 id="chapter-ii.">CHAPTER II.</h4>
<p>The little newspaper which Aleck had subscribed for was a Thursday
sheet; it would make the trip of five hundred miles from Tilbury’s
village and arrive on Saturday. Tilbury’s letter had started on Friday,
more than a day too late for the benefactor to die and get into that
week’s issue, but in plenty of time to make connection for the next
output. Thus the Fosters had to wait almost a complete week to find out
whether anything of a satisfactory nature had happened to him or not. It
was a long, long week, and the strain was a heavy one. The pair could
hardly have borne it if their minds had not had the relief of wholesome
diversion. We have seen that they had that. The woman was piling up
fortunes right along, the man was spending them –spending all his wife
would give him a chance at, at any rate.</p>
<p>At last the Saturday came, and the WEEKLY SAGAMORE arrived.
Mrs. Eversly Bennett was present. She was the Presbyterian parson’s
wife, and was working the Fosters for a charity. Talk now died a sudden
death–on the Foster side. Mrs. Bennett presently discovered that her
hosts were not hearing a word she was saying; so she got up, wondering
and indignant, and went away. The moment she was out of the house, Aleck
eagerly tore the wrapper from the paper, and her eyes and Sally’s swept
the columns for the death-notices. Disappointment! Tilbury was not
anywhere mentioned. Aleck was a Christian from the cradle, and duty and
the force of habit required her to go through the motions. She pulled
herself together and said, with a pious two-per-cent. trade
joyousness:</p>
<p>“Let us be humbly thankful that he has been spared; and–“</p>
<p>“Damn his treacherous hide, I wish–“</p>
<p>“Sally! For shame!“</p>
<p>“I don’t care!“ retorted the angry man. “It’s the way YOU feel, and
if you weren’t so immorally pious you’d be honest and say so.“</p>
<p>Aleck said, with wounded dignity:</p>
<p>“I do not see how you can say such unkind and unjust things. There is
no such thing as immoral piety.“</p>
<p>Sally felt a pang, but tried to conceal it under a shuffling attempt
to save his case by changing the form of it–as if changing the form
while retaining the juice could deceive the expert he was trying to
placate. He said:</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean so bad as that, Aleck; I didn’t really mean immoral
piety, I only meant–meant–well, conventional piety, you know; er–shop
piety; the–the–why, YOU know what I mean. Aleck–the–well, where you put
up that plated article and play it for solid, you know, without
intending anything improper, but just out of trade habit, ancient
policy, petrified custom, loyalty to–to–hang it, I can’t find the right
words, but YOU know what I mean, Aleck, and that there isn’t any harm in
it. I’ll try again. You see, it’s this way. If a person–“</p>
<p>“You have said quite enough,“ said Aleck, coldly; “let the subject be
dropped.“</p>
<p>“I’M willing,“ fervently responded Sally, wiping the sweat from his
forehead and looking the thankfulness he had no words for. Then,
musingly, he apologized to himself. “I certainly held threes –I KNOW
it–but I drew and didn’t fill. That’s where I’m so often weak in the
game. If I had stood pat–but I didn’t. I never do. I don’t know
enough.“</p>
<p>Confessedly defeated, he was properly tame now and subdued. Aleck
forgave him with her eyes.</p>
<p>The grand interest, the supreme interest, came instantly to the front
again; nothing could keep it in the background many minutes on a
stretch. The couple took up the puzzle of the absence of Tilbury’s
death-notice. They discussed it every which way, more or less hopefully,
but they had to finish where they began, and concede that the only
really sane explanation of the absence of the notice must be–and without
doubt was–that Tilbury was not dead. There was something sad about it,
something even a little unfair, maybe, but there it was, and had to be
put up with. They were agreed as to that. To Sally it seemed a strangely
inscrutable dispensation; more inscrutable than usual, he thought; one
of the most unnecessary inscrutable he could call to mind, in fact–and
said so, with some feeling; but if he was hoping to draw Aleck he
failed; she reserved her opinion, if she had one; she had not the habit
of taking injudicious risks in any market, worldly or other.</p>
<p>The pair must wait for next week’s paper–Tilbury had evidently
postponed. That was their thought and their decision. So they put the
subject away and went about their affairs again with as good heart as
they could.</p>
<p>Now, if they had but known it, they had been wronging Tilbury all the
time. Tilbury had kept faith, kept it to the letter; he was dead, he had
died to schedule. He was dead more than four days now and used to it;
entirely dead, perfectly dead, as dead as any other new person in the
cemetery; dead in abundant time to get into that week’s SAGAMORE, too,
and only shut out by an accident; an accident which could not happen to
a metropolitan journal, but which happens easily to a poor little
village rag like the SAGAMORE. On this occasion, just as the editorial
page was being locked up, a gratis quart of strawberry ice-water arrived
from Hostetter’s Ladies and Gents Ice-Cream Parlors, and the stickful of
rather chilly regret over Tilbury’s translation got crowded out to make
room for the editor’s frantic gratitude.</p>
<p>On its way to the standing-galley Tilbury’s notice got pied.
Otherwise it would have gone into some future edition, for WEEKLY
SAGAMORES do not waste “live“ matter, and in their galleys “live“ matter
is immortal, unless a pi accident intervenes. But a thing that gets pied
is dead, and for such there is no resurrection; its chance of seeing
print is gone, forever and ever. And so, let Tilbury like it or not, let
him rave in his grave to his fill, no matter–no mention of his death
would ever see the light in the WEEKLY SAGAMORE.</p>
