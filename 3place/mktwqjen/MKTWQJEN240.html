<h4 id="a-curious-pleasure-excursion">A CURIOUS PLEASURE EXCURSION</h4>
<p>–[Published at the time of the “Comet Scare“ in the summer of
1874]</p>
<p>[We have received the following advertisement, but, inasmuch as it
concerns a matter of deep and general interest, we feel fully justified
in inserting it in our reading-columns. We are confident that our
conduct in this regard needs only explanation, not apology.–Ed., N. Y.
Herald.]</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>This is to inform the public that in connection with Mr. Barnum I
have leased the comet for a term, of years; and I desire also to solicit
the public patronage in favor of a beneficial enterprise which we have
in view.</p>
<p>We propose to fit up comfortable, and even luxurious, accommodations
in the comet for as many persons as will honor us with their patronage,
and make an extended excursion among the heavenly bodies. We shall
prepare 1,000,000 state-rooms in the tail of the comet (with hot and
cold water, gas, looking-glass, parachute, umbrella, etc., in each), and
shall construct more if we meet with a sufficiently generous
encouragement. We shall have billiard-rooms, card-rooms, music-rooms,
bowling-alleys and many spacious theaters and free libraries; and on the
main deck we propose to have a driving park, with upward of 100,000
miles of roadway in it. We shall publish daily newspapers also.</p>
<p>DEPARTURE OF THE COMET</p>
<p>The comet will leave New York at 10 P.M. on the 20th inst., and
therefore it will be desirable that the passengers be on board by eight
at the latest, to avoid confusion in getting under way. It is not known
whether passports will be necessary or not, but it is deemed best that
passengers provide them, and so guard against all contingencies. No dogs
will be allowed on board. This rule has been made in deference to the
existing state of feeling regarding these animals, and will be strictly
adhered to. The safety of the passengers will in all ways be jealously
looked to. A substantial iron railing will be put up all around the
comet, and no one will be allowed to go to the edge and look over unless
accompanied by either my partner or myself.</p>
<p>THE POSTAL SERVICE</p>
<p>will be of the completest character. Of course the telegraph, and the
telegraph only, will be employed; consequently friends occupying
state-rooms 20,000,000 and even 30,000,000 miles apart will be able to
send a message and receive a reply inside of eleven days. Night messages
will be half-rate. The whole of this vast postal system will be under
the personal superintendence of Mr. Hale of Maine. Meals served at all
hours. Meals served in staterooms charged extra.</p>
<p>Hostility is not apprehended from any great planet, but we have
thought it best to err on the safe side, and therefore have provided a
proper number of mortars, siege-guns, and boarding-pikes. History shows
that small, isolated communities, such as the people of remote islands,
are prone to be hostile to strangers, and so the same may be the case
with</p>
<p>THE INHABITANTS OF STARS</p>
<p>of the tenth or twentieth magnitude. We shall in no case wantonly
offend the people of any star, but shall treat all alike with urbanity
and kindliness, never conducting ourselves toward an asteroid after a
fashion which we could not venture to assume toward Jupiter or Saturn. I
repeat that we shall not wantonly offend any star; but at the same time
we shall promptly resent any injury that may be done us, or any
insolence offered us, by parties or governments residing in any star in
the firmament. Although averse to the shedding of blood, we shall still
hold this course rigidly and fearlessly, not only toward single stars,
but toward constellations. We shall hope to leave a good impression of
America behind us in every nation we visit, from Venus to Uranus. And,
at all events, if we cannot inspire love we shall at least compel
respect for our country wherever we go. We shall take with us, free of
charge,</p>
<p>A GREAT FORCE OF MISSIONARIES,</p>
<p>and shed the true light upon all the celestial orbs which, physically
aglow, are yet morally in darkness. Sunday-schools will be established
wherever practicable. Compulsory education will also be introduced.</p>
<p>The comet will visit Mars first, and proceed to Mercury, Jupiter,
Venus, and Saturn. Parties connected with the government of the District
of Columbia and with the former city government of New York, who may
desire to inspect the rings, will be allowed time and every facility.
Every star of prominent magnitude will be visited, and time allowed for
excursions to points of interest inland.</p>
<p>THE DOG STAR</p>
<p>has been stricken from the program. Much time will be spent in the
Great Bear, and, indeed, in every constellation of importance. So, also,
with the Sun and Moon and the Milky Pay, otherwise the Gulf Stream of
the Skies. Clothing suitable for wear in the sun should be provided. Our
program has been so arranged that we shall seldom go more than
100,000,000 of miles at a time without stopping at some star. This will
necessarily make the stoppages frequent and preserve the interest of the
tourist. Baggage checked through to any point on the route. Parties
desiring to make only a part of the proposed tour, and thus save
expense, may stop over at any star they choose and wait for the return
voyage.</p>
<p>After visiting all the most celebrated stars and constellations in
our system and personally, inspecting the remotest sparks that even the
most powerful telescope can now detect in the firmament, we shall
proceed with good heart upon</p>
<p>A STUPENDOUS VOYAGE</p>
<p>of discovery among the countless whirling worlds that make turmoil in
the mighty wastes of space that stretch their solemn solitudes, their
unimaginable vastness billions upon billions of miles away beyond the
farthest verge of telescopic vision, till by comparison the little
sparkling vault we used to gaze at on Earth shall seem like a remembered
phosphorescent flash of spangles which some tropical voyager’s prow
stirred into life for a single instant, and which ten thousand miles of
phosphorescent seas and tedious lapse of time had since diminished to an
incident utterly trivial in his recollection. Children occupying seats
at the first table will be charged full fare.</p>
<p>FIRST-CLASS FARE</p>
<p>from the Earth to Uranus, including visits to the Sun and Moon and
all the principal planets on the route, will be charged at the low rate
of for every 50,000,000 miles of actual travel. A great reduction will
be made where parties wish to make the round trip. This comet is new and
in thorough repair and is now on her first voyage. She is confessedly
the fastest on the line. She makes 20,000,000 miles a day, with her
present facilities; but, with a picked American crew and good weather,
we are confident we can get 40,000,000 out of her. Still, we shall never
push her to a dangerous speed, and we shall rigidly prohibit racing with
other comets. Passengers desiring to diverge at any point or return will
be transferred to other comets. We make close connections at all
principal points with all reliable lines. Safety can be depended upon.
It is not to be denied that the heavens are infested with</p>
<p>OLD RAMSHACKLE COMETS</p>
<p>that have not been inspected or overhauled in 10,000 years, and which
ought long ago to have been destroyed or turned into hail-barges, but
with these we have no connection whatever. Steerage passengers not
allowed abaft the main hatch.</p>
<p>Complimentary round-trip tickets have been tendered to General
Butler, Mr. Shepherd, Mr. Richardson, and other eminent gentlemen, whose
public services have entitled them to the rest and relaxation of a
voyage of this kind. Parties desiring to make the round trip will have
extra accommodation. The entire voyage will be completed, and the
passengers landed in New York again, on the 14th of December, 1991. This
is, at least, forty years quicker than any other comet can do it in.
Nearly all the back-pay members contemplate making the round trip with
us in case their constituents will allow them a holiday. Every harmless
amusement will be allowed on board, but no pools permitted on the run of
the comet –no gambling of any kind. All fixed stars will be respected by
us, but such stars as seem, to need fixing we shall fix. If it makes
trouble, we shall be sorry, but firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Coggia having leased his comet to us, she will no longer be
called by his name, but by my partner’s. N. B.–Passengers by paying
double fare will be entitled to a share in all the new stars, suns,
moons, comets, meteors, and magazines of thunder and lightning we may
discover. Patent-medicine people will take notice that</p>
<p>WE CARRY BULLETIN-BOARDS</p>
<p>and a paint-brush along for use in the constellations, and are open
to terms. Cremationists are reminded that we are going straight to–some
hot places–and are open to terms. To other parties our enterprise is a
pleasure excursion, but individually we mean business. We shall fly our
comet for all it is worth.</p>
<p>FOR FURTHER PARTICULARS,</p>
<p>or for freight or passage, apply on board, or to my partner, but not
to me, since I do not take charge of the comet until she is under way.
It is necessary, at a time like this, that my mind should not be
burdened with small business details.</p>
<p>MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR–[Written about 1870.]</p>
<p>A few months ago I was nominated for Governor of the great state of
New York, to run against Mr. John T. Smith and Mr. Blank J. Blank on an
independent ticket. I somehow felt that I had one prominent advantage
over these gentlemen, and that was–good character. It was easy to see by
the newspapers that if ever they had known what it was to bear a good
name, that time had gone by. It was plain that in these latter years
they had become familiar with all manner of shameful crimes. But at the
very moment that I was exalting my advantage and joying in it in secret,
there was a muddy undercurrent of discomfort “riling“ the deeps of my
happiness, and that was–the having to hear my name bandied about in
familiar connection with those of such people. I grew more and more
disturbed. Finally I wrote my grandmother about it. Her answer came
quick and sharp. She said:</p>
<p>You have never done one single thing in all your life to be ashamed
of–not one. Look at the newspapers–look at them and comprehend what sort
of characters Messrs. Smith and Blank are, and then see if you are
willing to lower yourself to their level and enter a public canvass with
them.</p>
<p>It was my very thought! I did not sleep a single moment that night.
But, after all, I could not recede.</p>
<p>I was fully committed, and must go on with the fight. As I was
looking listlessly over the papers at breakfast I came across this
paragraph, and I may truly say I never was so confounded before.</p>
<p>PERJURY.–Perhaps, now that Mr. Mark Twain is before the people as a
candidate for Governor, he will condescend to explain how he came to be
convicted of perjury by thirty-four witnesses in Wakawak, Cochin China,
in 1863, the intent of which perjury being to rob a poor native widow
and her helpless family of a meager plantain-patch, their only stay and
support in their bereavement and desolation. Mr. Twain owes it to
himself, as well as to the great people whose suffrages he asks, to
clear this matter up. Will he do it?</p>
<p>I thought I should burst with amazement! Such a cruel, heartless
charge! I never had seen Cochin China! I never had heard of Wakawak! I
didn’t know a plantain-patch from a kangaroo! I did not know what to do.
I was crazed and helpless. I let the day slip away without doing
anything at all. The next morning the same paper had this–nothing
more:</p>
<p>SIGNIFICANT.–Mr. Twain, it will be observed, is suggestively silent
about the Cochin China perjury.</p>
<p>[Mem.–During the rest of the campaign this paper never referred to me
in any other way than as “the infamous perjurer Twain.“]</p>
<p>Next came the Gazette, with this:</p>
<p>WANTED TO KNOW.–Will the new candidate for Governor deign to explain
to certain of his fellow-citizens (who are suffering to vote for him!)
the little circumstance of his cabin-mates in Montana losing small
valuables from time to time, until at last, these things having been
invariably found on Mr. Twain’s person or in his “trunk“ (newspaper he
rolled his traps in), they felt compelled to give him a friendly
admonition for his own good, and so tarred and feathered him, and rode
him on a rail; and then advised him to leave a permanent vacuum in the
place he usually occupied in the camp. Will he do this?</p>
<p>Could anything be more deliberately malicious than that? For I never
was in Montana in my life.</p>
<p>[After this, this journal customarily spoke of me as, “Twain, the
Montana Thief.“]</p>
<p>I got to picking up papers apprehensively–much as one would lift a
desired blanket which he had some idea might have a rattlesnake under
it. One day this met my eye:</p>
<p>THE LIE NAILED.–By the sworn affidavits of Michael O’Flanagan, Esq.,
of the Five Points, and Mr. Snub Rafferty and Mr. Catty Mulligan, of
Water Street, it is established that Mr. Mark Twain’s vile statement
that the lamented grandfather of our noble standard-bearer, Blank J.
Blank, was hanged for highway robbery, is a brutal and gratuitous LIE,
without a shadow of foundation in fact. It is disheartening to virtuous
men to see such shameful means resorted to to achieve political success
as the attacking of the dead in their graves, and defiling their honored
names with slander. When we think of the anguish this miserable
falsehood must cause the innocent relatives and friends of the deceased,
we are almost driven to incite an outraged and insulted public to
summary and unlawful vengeance upon the traducer. But no! let us leave
him to the agony of a lacerated conscience (though if passion should get
the better of the public, and in its blind fury they should do the
traducer bodily injury, it is but too obvious that no jury could convict
and no court punish the perpetrators of the deed).</p>
<p>The ingenious closing sentence had the effect of moving me out of bed
with despatch that night, and out at the back door also, while the
“outraged and insulted public“ surged in the front way, breaking
furniture and windows in their righteous indignation as they came, and
taking off such property as they could carry when they went. And yet I
can lay my hand upon the Book and say that I never slandered Mr. Blank’s
grandfather. More: I had never even heard of him or mentioned him up to
that day and date.</p>
<p>[I will state, in passing, that the journal above quoted from always
referred to me afterward as “Twain, the Body-Snatcher.“]</p>
<p>The next newspaper article that attracted my attention was the
following:</p>
<p>A SWEET CANDIDATE.–Mr. Mark Twain, who was to make such a blighting
speech at the mass-meeting of the Independents last night, didn’t come
to time! A telegram from his physician stated that he had been knocked
down by a runaway team, and his leg broken in two places–sufferer lying
in great agony, and so forth, and so forth, and a lot more bosh of the
same sort. And the Independents tried hard to swallow the wretched
subterfuge, and pretend that they did not know what was the real reason
of the absence of the abandoned creature whom they denominate their
standard-bearer. A certain man was seen to reel into Mr. Twain’s hotel
last night in a state of beastly intoxication. It is the imperative duty
of the Independents to prove that this besotted brute was not Mark Twain
himself. We have them at last! This is a case that admits of no
shirking. The voice of the people demands in thunder tones, “WHO WAS
THAT MAN?“</p>
<p>It was incredible, absolutely incredible, for a moment, that it was
really my name that was coupled with this disgraceful suspicion. Three
long years had passed over my head since I had tasted ale, beer, wine or
liquor or any kind.</p>
<p>[It shows what effect the times were having on me when I say that I
saw myself, confidently dubbed “Mr. Delirium Tremens Twain“ in the next
issue of that journal without a pang–notwithstanding I knew that with
monotonous fidelity the paper would go on calling me so to the very
end.]</p>
<p>By this time anonymous letters were getting to be an important part
of my mail matter. This form was common:</p>
<p>How about that old woman you kiked of your premises which was beging.
POL. PRY.</p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p>There is things which you Have done which is unbeknowens to anybody
but me. You better trot out a few dots, to yours truly, or you’ll hear
through the papers from HANDY ANDY.</p>
<p>This is about the idea. I could continue them till the reader was
surfeited, if desirable.</p>
<p>Shortly the principal Republican journal “convicted“ me of wholesale
bribery, and the leading Democratic paper “nailed“ an aggravated case of
blackmailing to me.</p>
<p>[In this way I acquired two additional names: “Twain the Filthy
Corruptionist“ and “Twain the Loathsome Embracer.“]</p>
<p>By this time there had grown to be such a clamor for an “answer“ to
all the dreadful charges that were laid to me that the editors and
leaders of my party said it would be political ruin for me to remain
silent any longer. As if to make their appeal the more imperative, the
following appeared in one of the papers the very next day:</p>
<p>BEHOLD THE MAN!–The independent candidate still maintains silence.
Because he dare not speak. Every accusation against him has been amply
proved, and they have been indorsed and reindorsed by his own eloquent
silence, till at this day he stands forever convicted. Look upon your
candidate, Independents! Look upon the Infamous Perjurer! the Montana
Thief! the Body-Snatcher! Contemplate your incarnate Delirium Tremens!
your Filthy Corruptionist! your Loathsome Embracer! Gaze upon him–ponder
him well–and then say if you can give your honest votes to a creature
who has earned this dismal array of titles by his hideous crimes, and
dares not open his mouth in denial of any one of them!</p>
<p>There was no possible way of getting out of it, and so, in deep
humiliation, I set about preparing to “answer“ a mass of baseless
charges and mean and wicked falsehoods. But I never finished the task,
for the very next morning a paper came out with a new horror, a fresh
malignity, and seriously charged me with burning a lunatic asylum with
all its inmates, because it obstructed the view from my house. This
threw me into a sort of panic. Then came the charge of poisoning my
uncle to get his property, with an imperative demand that the grave
should be opened. This drove me to the verge of distraction. On top of
this I was accused of employing toothless and incompetent old relatives
to prepare the food for the foundling’ hospital when I warden. I was
wavering–wavering. And at last, as a due and fitting climax to the
shameless persecution that party rancor had inflicted upon me, nine
little toddling children, of all shades of color and degrees of
raggedness, were taught to rush onto the platform at a public meeting,
and clasp me around the legs and call me PA!</p>
<p>I gave it up. I hauled down my colors and surrendered. I was not
equal to the requirements of a Gubernatorial campaign in the state of
New York, and so I sent in my withdrawal from the candidacy, and in
bitterness of spirit signed it, “Truly yours, once a decent man, but
now</p>
