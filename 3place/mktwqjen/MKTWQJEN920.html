OF 1880, CHIEFLY TO HOWELLS. “THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER.“ MARK TWAIN
MUGWUMP SOCIETY</h4>
<p>The book of travel,–[A Tramp Abroad.]–which Mark Twain had hoped to
finish in Paris, and later in Elmira, for some reason would not come to
an end. In December, in Hartford, he was still working on it, and he
would seem to have finished it, at last, rather by a decree than by any
natural process of authorship. This was early in January, 1880. To
Howells he reports his difficulties, and his drastic method of ending
them.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Jan. 8, ’80. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Am waiting for Patrick to
come with the carriage. Mrs. Clemens and I are starting (without the
children) to stay indefinitely in Elmira. The wear and tear of settling
the house broke her down, and she has been growing weaker and weaker for
a fortnight. All that time–in fact ever since I saw you–I have been
fighting a life-and-death battle with this infernal book and hoping to
get done some day. I required 300 pages of MS, and I have written near
600 since I saw you–and tore it all up except 288. This I was about to
tear up yesterday and begin again, when Mrs. Perkins came up to the
billiard room and said, “You will never get any woman to do the thing
necessary to save her life by mere persuasion; you see you have wasted
your words for three weeks; it is time to use force; she must have a
change; take her home and leave the children here.“</p>
<p>I said, “If there is one death that is painfuller than another, may I
get it if I don’t do that thing.“</p>
<p>So I took the 288 pages to Bliss and told him that was the very last
line I should ever write on this book. (A book which required 2600 pages
of MS, and I have written nearer four thousand, first and last.)</p>
<p>I am as soary (and flighty) as a rocket, to-day, with the unutterable
joy of getting that Old Man of the Sea off my back, where he has been
roosting for more than a year and a half. Next time I make a contract
before writing the book, may I suffer the righteous penalty and be
burnt, like the injudicious believer.</p>
<p>I am mighty glad you are done your book (this is from a man who,
above all others, feels how much that sentence means) and am also mighty
glad you have begun the next (this is also from a man who knows the
felicity of that, and means straightway to enjoy it.) The Undiscovered
starts off delightfully–I have read it aloud to Mrs. C. and we vastly
enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Well, time’s about up–must drop a line to Aldrich. Yrs ever,
MARK.</p>
<p>In a letter which Mark Twain wrote to his brother Orion at this
period we get the first hint of a venture which was to play an
increasingly important part in the Hartford home and fortunes during the
next ten or a dozen years. This was the type-setting machine investment,
which, in the end, all but wrecked Mark Twain’s finances. There is but a
brief mention of it in the letter to Orion, and the letter itself is not
worth preserving, but as references to the “machine“ appear with
increasing frequency, it seems proper to record here its first mention.
In the same letter he suggests to his brother that he undertake an
absolutely truthful autobiography, a confession in which nothing is to
be withheld. He cites the value of Casanova’s memories, and the
confessions of Rousseau. Of course, any literary suggestion from
“Brother Sam“ was gospel to Orion, who began at once piling up
manuscript at a great rate.</p>
<p>Meantime, Mark Twain himself, having got ‘A Tramp Abroad’ on the
presses, was at work with enthusiasm on a story begun nearly three years
before at Quarry Farm-a story for children-its name, as he called it
then, “The Little Prince and The Little Pauper.“ He was presently
writing to Howells his delight in the new work.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>HARTFORD, Mch. 11, ’80. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–…..I take so much pleasure
in my story that I am loth to hurry, not wanting to get it done. Did I
ever tell you the plot of it? It begins at 9 a.m., Jan. 27, 1547,
seventeen and a half hours before Henry VIII’s death, by the swapping of
clothes and place, between the prince of Wales and a pauper boy of the
same age and countenance (and half as much learning and still more
genius and imagination) and after that, the rightful small King has a
rough time among tramps and ruffians in the country parts of Kent,
whilst the small bogus King has a gilded and worshipped and dreary and
restrained and cussed time of it on the throne–and this all goes on for
three weeks–till the midst of the coronation grandeurs in Westminster
Abbey, Feb. 20, when the ragged true King forces his way in but cannot
prove his genuineness–until the bogus King, by a remembered incident of
the first day is able to prove it for him–whereupon clothes are changed
and the coronation proceeds under the new and rightful conditions.</p>
<p>My idea is to afford a realizing sense of the exceeding severity of
the laws of that day by inflicting some of their penalties upon the King
himself and allowing him a chance to see the rest of them applied to
others–all of which is to account for certain mildnesses which
distinguished Edward VI’s reign from those that preceded and followed
it.</p>
<p>Imagine this fact–I have even fascinated Mrs. Clemens with this yarn
for youth. My stuff generally gets considerable damning with faint
praise out of her, but this time it is all the other way. She is become
the horseleech’s daughter and my mill doesn’t grind fast enough to suit
her. This is no mean triumph, my dear sir.</p>
<p>Last night, for the first time in ages, we went to the theatre–to see
Yorick’s Love. The magnificence of it is beyond praise. The language is
so beautiful, the passion so fine, the plot so ingenious, the whole
thing so stirring, so charming, so pathetic! But I will clip from the
Courant –it says it right.</p>
<p>And what a good company it is, and how like live people they all
acted! The “thee’s“ and the “thou’s“ had a pleasant sound, since it is
the language of the Prince and the Pauper. You’ve done the country a
service in that admirable work…. Yrs Ever, MARK.</p>
<p>The play, “Yorick’s Love,“ mentioned in this letter, was one which
Howells had done for Lawrence Barrett.</p>
<p>Onion Clemens, meantime, was forwarding his manuscript, and for once
seems to have won his brother’s approval, so much so that Mark Twain was
willing, indeed anxious, that Howells should run the “autobiography“ in
the Atlantic. We may imagine how Onion prized the words of commendation
which follow:</p>
<p>To Orion Clemens:</p>
<p>May 6, ’80. MY DEAR BROTHER,–It is a model autobiography.</p>
<p>Continue to develop your character in the same gradual inconspicuous
and apparently unconscious way. The reader, up to this time, may have
his doubts, perhaps, but he can’t say decidedly, “This writer is not
such a simpleton as he has been letting on to be.“ Keep him in that
state of mind. If, when you shall have finished, the reader shall say,
“The man is an ass, but I really don’t know whether he knows it or not,“
your work will be a triumph.</p>
<p>Stop re-writing. I saw places in your last batch where re-writing had
done formidable injury. Do not try to find those places, else you will
mar them further by trying to better them. It is perilous to revise a
book while it is under way. All of us have injured our books in that
foolish way.</p>
<p>Keep in mind what I told you–when you recollect something which
belonged in an earlier chapter, do not go back, but jam it in where you
are. Discursiveness does not hurt an autobiography in the least.</p>
<p>I have penciled the MS here and there, but have not needed to make
any criticisms or to knock out anything.</p>
<p>The elder Bliss has heart disease badly, and thenceforth his life
hangs upon a thread. Yr Bro SAM.</p>
<p>But Howells could not bring himself to print so frank a confession as
Orion had been willing to make. “It wrung my heart,“ he said, “and I
felt haggard after I had finished it. The writer’s soul is laid bare; it
is shocking.“ Howells added that the best touches in it were those which
made one acquainted with the writer’s brother; that is to say, Mark
Twain, and that these would prove valuable material hereafter–a true
prophecy, for Mark Twain’s early biography would have lacked most of its
vital incident, and at least half of its background, without those
faithful chapters, fortunately preserved. Had Onion continued, as he
began, the work might have proved an important contribution to
literature, but he went trailing off into by-paths of theology and
discussion where the interest was lost. There were, perhaps, as many as
two thousand pages of it, which few could undertake to read.</p>
<p>Mark Twain’s mind was always busy with plans and inventions, many of
them of serious intent, some semi-serious, others of a purely whimsical
character. Once he proposed a “Modest Club,“ of which the first and main
qualification for membership was modesty. “At present,“ he wrote, “I am
the only member; and as the modesty required must be of a quite
aggravated type, the enterprise did seem for a time doomed to stop dead
still with myself, for lack of further material; but upon reflection I
have come to the conclusion that you are eligible. Therefore, I have
held a meeting and voted to offer you the distinction of membership. I
do not know that we can find any others, though I have had some thought
of Hay, Warner, Twichell, Aldrich, Osgood, Fields, Higginson, and a few
more –together with Mrs. Howells, Mrs. Clemens, and certain others of
the sex.“</p>
<p>Howells replied that the only reason he had for not joining the
Modest Club was that he was too modest–too modest to confess his
modesty. “If I could get over this difficulty I should like to join, for
I approve highly of the Club and its object…. It ought to be given an
annual dinner at the public expense. If you think I am not too modest
you may put my name down and I will try to think the same of you.
Mrs. Howells applauded the notion of the club from the very first. She
said that she knew one thing: that she was modest enough, anyway. Her
manner of saying it implied that the other persons you had named were
not, and created a painful impression in my mind. I have sent your
letter and the rules to Hay, but I doubt his modesty. He will think he
has a right to belong to it as much as you or I; whereas, other people
ought only to be admitted on sufferance.“</p>
<p>Our next letter to Howells is, in the main, pure foolery, but we get
in it a hint what was to become in time one of Mask Twain’s strongest
interests, the matter of copyright. He had both a personal and general
interest in the subject. His own books were constantly pirated in
Canada, and the rights of foreign authors were not respected in America.
We have already seen how he had drawn a petition which Holmes, Lowell,
Longfellow, and others were to sign, and while nothing had come of this
plan he had never ceased to formulate others. Yet he hesitated when he
found that the proposed protection was likely to work a hardship to
readers of the poorer class. Once he wrote: “My notions have mightily
changed lately…. I can buy a lot of the copyright classics, in paper, at
from three to thirty cents apiece. These things must find their way into
the very kitchens and hovels of the country….. And even if the treaty
will kill Canadian piracy, and thus save me an average of ,000 a year, I
am down on it anyway, and I’d like cussed well to write an article
opposing the treaty.“</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Belmont, Mass.:</p>
<p>Thursday, June 6th, 1880. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–There you stick, at
Belmont, and now I’m going to Washington for a few days; and of course,
between you and Providence that visit is going to get mixed, and you’ll
have been here and gone again just about the time I get back. Bother it
all, I wanted to astonish you with a chapter or two from Orion’s latest
book–not the seventeen which he has begun in the last four months, but
the one which he began last week.</p>
<p>Last night, when I went to bed, Mrs. Clemens said, “George didn’t
take the cat down to the cellar–Rosa says he has left it shut up in the
conservatory.“ So I went down to attend to Abner (the cat.) About 3 in
the morning Mrs. C. woke me and said, “I do believe I hear that cat in
the drawing-room–what did you do with him?“ I answered up with the
confidence of a man who has managed to do the right thing for once, and
said “I opened the conservatory doors, took the library off the alarm,
and spread everything open, so that there wasn’t any obstruction between
him and the cellar.“ Language wasn’t capable of conveying this woman’s
disgust. But the sense of what she said, was, “He couldn’t have done any
harm in the conservatory–so you must go and make the entire house free
to him and the burglars, imagining that he will prefer the coal-bins to
the drawing-room. If you had had Mr. Howells to help you, I should have
admired but not been astonished, because I should know that together you
would be equal to it; but how you managed to contrive such a stately
blunder all by yourself, is what I cannot understand.“</p>
<p>So, you see, even she knows how to appreciate our gifts.</p>
<p>Brisk times here.–Saturday, these things happened: Our neighbor Chas.
Smith was stricken with heart disease, and came near joining the
majority; my publisher, Bliss, ditto, ditto; a neighbor’s child died;
neighbor Whitmore’s sixth child added to his five other cases of
measles; neighbor Niles sent for, and responded; Susie Warner down,
abed; Mrs. George Warner threatened with death during several hours; her
son Frank, whilst imitating the marvels in Barnum’s circus bills, thrown
from his aged horse and brought home insensible: Warner’s friend Max
Yortzburgh, shot in the back by a locomotive and broken into 32 distinct
pieces and his life threatened; and Mrs. Clemens, after writing all
these cheerful things to Clara Spaulding, taken at midnight, and if the
doctor had not been pretty prompt the contemplated Clemens would have
called before his apartments were ready.</p>
<p>However, everybody is all right, now, except Yortzburg, and he is
mending–that is, he is being mended. I knocked off, during these
stirring times, and don’t intend to go to work again till we go away for
the Summer, 3 or 6 weeks hence. So I am writing to you not because I
have anything to say, but because you don’t have to answer and I need
something to do this afternoon…..</p>
<p>I have a letter from a Congressman this morning, and he says Congress
couldn’t be persuaded to bother about Canadian pirates at a time like
this when all legislation must have a political and Presidential
bearing, else Congress won’t look at it. So have changed my mind and my
course; I go north, to kill a pirate. I must procure repose some way,
else I cannot get down to work again.</p>
<p>Pray offer my most sincere and respectful approval to the
President–is approval the proper word? I find it is the one I most value
here in the household and seldomest get.</p>
<p>With our affection to you both. Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>It was always dangerous to send strangers with letters of
introduction to Mark Twain. They were so apt to arrive at the wrong
time, or to find him in the wrong mood. Howells was willing to risk it,
and that the result was only amusing instead of tragic is the best proof
of their friendship.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Belmont, Mass.:</p>
<p>June 9, ’80. Well, old practical joker, the corpse of Mr. X—-has been
here, and I have bedded it and fed it, and put down my work during 24
hours and tried my level best to make it do something, or say something,
or appreciate something–but no, it was worse than Lazarus. A
kind-hearted, well-meaning corpse was the Boston young man, but lawsy
bless me, horribly dull company. Now, old man, unless you have great
confidence in Mr. X’s judgment, you ought to make him submit his article
to you before he prints it. For only think how true I was to you: Every
hour that he was here I was saying, gloatingly, “O G– d— you, when you
are in bed and your light out, I will fix you“ (meaning to kill him)….,
but then the thought would follow–“ No, Howells sent him–he shall be
spared, he shall be respected he shall travel hell-wards by his own
route.“</p>
<p>Breakfast is frozen by this time, and Mrs. Clemens correspondingly
hot. Good bye. Yrs ever, MARK.</p>
<p>“I did not expect you to ask that man to live with you,“ Howells
answered. “What I was afraid of was that you would turn him out of
doors, on sight, and so I tried to put in a good word for him. After
this when I want you to board people, I’ll ask you. I am sorry for your
suffering. I suppose I have mostly lost my smell for bores; but yours is
preternaturally keen. I shall begin to be afraid I bore you. (How does
that make you feel?)“</p>
<p>In a letter to Twichell–a remarkable letter–when baby Jean Clemens
was about a month old, we get a happy hint of conditions at Quarry Farm,
and in the background a glimpse of Mark Twain’s unfailing tragic
reflection.</p>
<p>To Rev. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>QUARRY FARM, Aug. 29 [’80]. DEAR OLD JOE,–Concerning Jean Clemens, if
anybody said he “didn’t see no pints about that frog that’s any better’n
any other frog,“ I should think he was convicting himself of being a
pretty poor sort of observer…. I will not go into details; it is not
necessary; you will soon be in Hartford, where I have already hired a
hall; the admission fee will be but a trifle.</p>
<p>It is curious to note the change in the stock-quotation of the
Affection Board brought about by throwing this new security on the
market. Four weeks ago the children still put Mamma at the head of the
list right along, where she had always been. But now:</p>
<p>Jean Mamma Motley [a cat] Fraulein [another] Papa</p>
<p>That is the way it stands, now Mamma is become No. 2; I have dropped
from No. 4., and am become No. 5. Some time ago it used to be nip and
tuck between me and the cats, but after the cats “developed“ I didn’t
stand any more show.</p>
<p>I’ve got a swollen ear; so I take advantage of it to lie abed most of
the day, and read and smoke and scribble and have a good time. Last
evening Livy said with deep concern, “O dear, I believe an abscess is
forming in your ear.“</p>
<p>I responded as the poet would have done if he had had a cold in the
head–</p>
<p>“Tis said that abscess conquers love, But O believe it not.“</p>
<p>This made a coolness.</p>
<p>Been reading Daniel Webster’s Private Correspondence. Have read a
hundred of his diffuse, conceited, “eloquent,“ bathotic (or bathostic)
letters written in that dim (no, vanished) Past when he was a student;
and Lord, to think that this boy who is so real to me now, and so
booming with fresh young blood and bountiful life, and sappy cynicisms
about girls, has since climbed the Alps of fame and stood against the
sun one brief tremendous moment with the world’s eyes upon him, and
then–f-z-t-! where is he? Why the only long thing, the only real thing
about the whole shadowy business is the sense of the lagging dull and
hoary lapse of time that has drifted by since then; a vast empty level,
it seems, with a formless spectre glimpsed fitfully through the smoke
and mist that lie along its remote verge.</p>
<p>Well, we are all getting along here first-rate; Livy gains strength
daily, and sits up a deal; the baby is five weeks old and–but no more of
this; somebody may be reading this letter 80 years hence. And so, my
friend (you pitying snob, I mean, who are holding this yellow paper in
your hand in 1960,) save yourself the trouble of looking further; I know
how pathetically trivial our small concerns will seem to you, and I will
not let your eye profane them. No, I keep my news; you keep your
compassion. Suffice it you to know, scoffer and ribald, that the little
child is old and blind, now, and once more toothless; and the rest of us
are shadows, these many, many years. Yes, and your time cometh!</p>
<p>MARK.</p>
<p>At the Farm that year Mark Twain was working on The Prince and the
Pauper, and, according to a letter to Aldrich, brought it to an end
September 19th. It is a pleasant letter, worth preserving. The book by
Aldrich here mentioned was ‘The Stillwater Tragedy.’</p>
<p>To T. B. Aldrich, in Ponkapog, Mass.:</p>
<p>ELMIRA, Sept. 15, ’80. MY DEAR ALDRICH,–Thank you ever so much for
the book–I had already finished it, and prodigiously enjoyed it, in the
periodical of the notorious Howells, but it hits Mrs. Clemens just
right, for she is having a reading holiday, now, for the first time in
same months; so between-times, when the new baby is asleep and
strengthening up for another attempt to take possession of this place,
she is going to read it. Her strong friendship for you makes her think
she is going to like it.</p>
<p>I finished a story yesterday, myself. I counted up and found it
between sixty and eighty thousand words–about the size of your book. It
is for boys and girls–been at work at it several years, off and on.</p>
<p>I hope Howells is enjoying his journey to the Pacific. He wrote me
that you and Osgood were going, also, but I doubted it, believing he was
in liquor when he wrote it. In my opinion, this universal applause over
his book is going to land that man in a Retreat inside of two months. I
notice the papers say mighty fine things about your book, too. You ought
to try to get into the same establishment with Howells. But applause
does not affect me–I am always calm–this is because I am used to it.</p>
<p>Well, good-bye, my boy, and good luck to you. Mrs. Clemens asks me to
send her warmest regards to you and Mrs. Aldrich–which I do, and add
those of Yrs ever MARK.</p>
<p>While Mark Twain was a journalist in San Francisco, there was a
middle-aged man named Soule, who had a desk near him on the Morning
Call. Soule was in those days highly considered as a poet by his
associates, most of whom were younger and less gracefully poetic. But
Soule’s gift had never been an important one. Now, in his old age, he
found his fame still local, and he yearned for wider recognition. He
wished to have a volume of poems issued by a publisher of recognized
standing. Because Mark Twain had been one of Soule’s admirers and a warm
friend in the old days, it was natural that Soule should turn to him
now, and equally natural that Clemens should turn to Howells.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>Sunday, Oct. 2 ’80. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–Here’s a letter which I wrote
you to San Francisco the second time you didn’t go there…. I told Soule
he needn’t write you, but simply send the MS. to you. O dear, dear, it
is dreadful to be an unrecognized poet. How wise it was in Charles
Warren Stoddard to take in his sign and go for some other calling while
still young.</p>
<p>I’m laying for that Encyclopedical Scotchman–and he’ll need to lock
the door behind him, when he comes in; otherwise when he hears my
proposed tariff his skin will probably crawl away with him. He is
accustomed to seeing the publisher impoverish the author–that spectacle
must be getting stale to him–if he contracts with the undersigned he
will experience a change in that programme that will make the enamel
peel off his teeth for very surprise–and joy. No, that last is what
Mrs. Clemens thinks–but it’s not so. The proposed work is growing,
mightily, in my estimation, day by day; and I’m not going to throw it
away for any mere trifle. If I make a contract with the canny Scot, I
will then tell him the plan which you and I have devised (that of taking
in the humor of all countries)–otherwise I’ll keep it to myself, I
think. Why should we assist our fellowman for mere love of God? Yrs ever
MARK.</p>
<p>One wishes that Howells might have found value enough in the verses
of Frank Soule to recommend them to Osgood. To Clemens he wrote: “You
have touched me in regard to him, and I will deal gently with his
poetry. Poor old fellow! I can imagine him, and how he must have to
struggle not to be hard or sour.“</p>
<p>The verdict, however, was inevitable. Soule’s graceful verses proved
to be not poetry at all. No publisher of standing could afford to give
them his imprint.</p>
<p>The “Encyclopedical Scotchman“ mentioned in the preceding letter was
the publisher Gebbie, who had a plan to engage Howells and Clemens to
prepare some sort of anthology of the world’s literature. The idea came
to nothing, though the other plan mentioned–for a library of humor–in
time grew into a book.</p>
<p>Mark Twain’s contracts with Bliss for the publication of his books on
the subscription plan had been made on a royalty basis, beginning with 5
per cent. on ‘The Innocents Abroad’ increasing to 7 per cent. on
‘Roughing It,’ and to 10 per cent. on later books. Bliss had held that
these later percentages fairly represented one half the profits.
Clemens, however, had never been fully satisfied, and his brother Onion
had more than once urged him to demand a specific contract on the
half-profit basis. The agreement for the publication of ‘A Tramp Abroad’
was made on these terms. Bliss died before Clemens received his first
statement of sales. Whatever may have been the facts under earlier
conditions, the statement proved to Mark Twain’s satisfaction; at least,
that the half-profit arrangement was to his advantage. It produced
another result; it gave Samuel Clemens an excuse to place his brother
Onion in a position of independence.</p>
<p>To Onion Clemens, in Keokuk, Iowa:</p>
<p>Sunday, Oct 24 ’80. MY DEAR BRO.,–Bliss is dead. The aspect of the
balance-sheet is enlightening. It reveals the fact, through my present
contract, (which is for half the profits on the book above actual cost
of paper, printing and binding,) that I have lost considerably by all
this nonsense–sixty thousand dollars, I should say–and if Bliss were
alive I would stay with the concern and get it all back; for on each new
book I would require a portion of that back pay; but as it is (this in
the very strictest confidence,) I shall probably go to a new publisher 6
or 8 months hence, for I am afraid Frank, with his poor health, will
lack push and drive.</p>
<p>Out of the suspicions you bred in me years ago, has grown this
result, –to wit, that I shall within the twelvemonth get 0,000 out of
this “Tramp“ instead Of 0,000. Twenty thousand dollars, after taxes and
other expenses are stripped away, is worth to the investor about 5 a
month–so I shall tell Mr. Perkins to make your check that amount per
month, hereafter, while our income is able to afford it. This ends the
loan business; and hereafter you can reflect that you are living not on
borrowed money but on money which you have squarely earned, and which
has no taint or savor of charity about it–and you can also reflect that
the money you have been receiving of me all these years is interest
charged against the heavy bill which the next publisher will have to
stand who gets a book of mine.</p>
<p>Jean got the stockings and is much obliged; Mollie wants to know whom
she most resembles, but I can’t tell; she has blue eyes and brown hair,
and three chins, and is very fat and happy; and at one time or another
she has resembled all the different Clemenses and Langdons, in turn,
that have ever lived.</p>
<p>Livy is too much beaten out with the baby, nights, to write, these
times; and I don’t know of anything urgent to say, except that a basket
full of letters has accumulated in the 7 days that I have been whooping
and cursing over a cold in the head–and I must attack the pile this very
minute. With love from us Y aff SAM 5 enclosed.</p>
<p>On the completion of The Prince and Pauper story, Clemens had
naturally sent it to Howells for consideration. Howells wrote: “I have
read the two P’s and I like it immensely, it begins well and it ends
well.“ He pointed out some things that might be changed or omitted, and
added: “It is such a book as I would expect from you, knowing what a
bottom of fury there is to your fun.“ Clemens had thought somewhat of
publishing the story anonymously, in the fear that it would not be
accepted seriously over his own signature.</p>
<p>The “bull story“ referred to in the next letter is the one later used
in the Joan of Arc book, the story told Joan by “Uncle Laxart,“ how he
rode a bull to a funeral.</p>
<p>To W. D. Howells, in Boston:</p>
<p>Xmas Eve, 1880. MY DEAR HOWELLS,–I was prodigiously delighted with
what you said about the book–so, on the whole, I’ve concluded to publish
intrepidly, instead of concealing the authorship. I shall leave out that
bull story.</p>
<p>I wish you had gone to New York. The company was small, and we had a
first-rate time. Smith’s an enjoyable fellow. I liked Barrett, too. And
the oysters were as good as the rest of the company. It was worth going
there to learn how to cook them.</p>
<p>Next day I attended to business–which was, to introduce Twichell to
Gen. Grant and procure a private talk in the interest of the Chinese
Educational Mission here in the U. S. Well, it was very funny. Joe had
been sitting up nights building facts and arguments together into a
mighty and unassailable array and had studied them out and got them by
heart–all with the trembling half-hearted hope of getting Grant to add
his signature to a sort of petition to the Viceroy of China; but Grant
took in the whole situation in a jiffy, and before Joe had more than
fairly got started, the old man said: “I’ll write the Viceroy a Letter
–a separate letter–and bring strong reasons to bear upon him; I know him
well, and what I say will have weight with him; I will attend to it
right away. No, no thanks–I shall be glad to do it–it will be a labor of
love.“</p>
<p>So all Joe’s laborious hours were for naught! It was as if he had
come to borrow a dollar, and been offered a thousand before he could
unfold his case….</p>
<p>But it’s getting dark. Merry Christmas to all of you. Yrs Ever,
MARK.</p>
<p>The Chinese Educational Mission, mentioned in the foregoing, was a
thriving Hartford institution, projected eight years before by a Yale
graduate named Yung Wing. The mission was now threatened, and Yung Wing,
knowing the high honor in which General Grant was held in China,
believed that through him it might be saved. Twichell, of course, was
deeply concerned and naturally overjoyed at Grant’s interest. A day or
two following the return to Hartford, Clemens received a letter from
General Grant, in which he wrote: “Li Hung Chang is the most powerful
and most influential Chinaman in his country. He professed great
friendship for me when I was there, and I have had assurances of the
same thing since. I hope, if he is strong enough with his government,
that the decision to withdraw the Chinese students from this country may
be changed.“</p>
<p>But perhaps Li Hung Chang was experiencing one of his partial
eclipses just then, or possibly he was not interested, for the Hartford
Mission did not survive.</p>
