1894. A WINTER IN NEW YORK. BUSINESS FAILURE. END OF THE MACHINE</h4>
<p>The beginning of the new year found Mark Twain sailing buoyantly on a
tide of optimism. He believed that with H. H. Rogers as his financial
pilot he could weather safely any storm or stress. He could divert
himself, or rest, or work, and consider his business affairs with
interest and amusement, instead of with haggard anxiety. He ran over to
Hartford to see an amateur play; to Boston to give a charity reading; to
Fair Haven to open the library which Mr. Rogers had established there;
he attended gay dinners, receptions, and late studio parties, acquiring
the name of the “Belle of New York.“ In the letters that follow we get
the echo of some of these things. The Mrs. Rice mentioned in the next
brief letter was the wife of Dr. Clarence C. Rice, who had introduced H.
H. Rogers to Mark Twain.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Paris:</p>
<p>Jan. 12, ’94 Livy darling, I came down from Hartford yesterday with
Kipling, and he and Hutton and I had the small smoking compartment to
ourselves and found him at last at his ease, and not shy. He was very
pleasant company indeed. He is to be in the city a week, and I wish I
could invite him to dinner, but it won’t do. I should be interrupted by
business, of course. The construction of a contract that will suit
Paige’s lawyer (not Paige) turns out to be very difficult. He is
embarrassed by earlier advice to Paige, and hates to retire from it and
stultify himself. The negotiations are being conducted, by means of
tedious long telegrams and by talks over the long-distance telephone. We
keep the wires loaded.</p>
<p>Dear me, dinner is ready. So Mrs. Rice says.</p>
<p>With worlds of love, SAML.</p>
<p>Clemens and Oliver Wendell Holmes had met and become friends soon
after the publication of Innocents Abroad, in 1869. Now, twenty-five
years later, we find a record of what without doubt was their last
meeting. It occurred at the home of Mrs. James T. Field.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Paris:</p>
<p>BOSTON, Jan. 25, ’94. Livy darling, I am caught out worse this time
than ever before, in the matter of letters. Tuesday morning I was smart
enough to finish and mail my long letter to you before breakfast–for I
was suspecting that I would not have another spare moment during the
day. It turned out just so.</p>
<p>In a thoughtless moment I agreed to come up here and read for the
poor. I did not reflect that it would cost me three days. I could not
get released. Yesterday I had myself called at 8 and ran out to
Mr. Rogers’s house at 9, and talked business until half past 10; then
caught 11 o’clock train and arrived here at 6; was shaven and dressed by
7 and ready for dinner here in Mrs. Field’s charming house.</p>
<p>Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes never goes out now (he is in his 84th
year,) but he came out this time-said he wanted to “have a time“ once
more with me.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fields said Aldrich begged to come and went away crying because
she wouldn’t let him. She allowed only her family (Sarah Orne Jewett and
sister) to be present, because much company would overtax
Dr. Holmes.</p>
<p>Well, he was just delightful! He did as brilliant and beautiful
talking (and listening) as ever he did in his life, I guess. Fields and
Jewett said he hadn’t been in such splendid form in years. He had
ordered his carriage for 9.</p>
<p>The coachman sent in for him at 9; but he said, “Oh, nonsense!–leave
glories and grandeurs like these? Tell him to go away and come in an
hour!“</p>
<p>At 10 he was called for again, and Mrs. Fields, getting uneasy, rose,
but he wouldn’t go–and so we rattled ahead the same as ever. Twice more
Mrs. Fields rose, but he wouldn’t go–and he didn’t go till half past 10
–an unwarrantable dissipation for him in these days. He was prodigiously
complimentary about some of my books, and is having Pudd’nhead read to
him. I told him you and I used the Autocrat as a courting book and
marked it all through, and that you keep it in the sacred green box with
the love letters, and it pleased him.</p>
<p>Good-bye, my dear darling, it is 15 minutes to dinner and I’m not
dressed yet. I have a reception to-night and will be out very late at
that place and at Irving’s Theatre where I have a complimentary box. I
wish you were all here. SAML.</p>
<p>In the next letter we meet James J. Corbett–“Gentleman Jim,“ as he
was sometimes called–the champion pugilist of that day.</p>
<p>The Howells incident so amusingly dramatized will perhaps be more
appreciated if the reader remembers that Mark Twain himself had at
intervals been a mind-healing enthusiast. Indeed, in spite of his
strictures on Mrs. Eddy, his interest in the subject of mind-cure
continued to the end of his life.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Paris:</p>
<p>Sunday, 9.30 a. m. Livy dear, when we got out to the house last
night, Mrs. Rogers, who is up and around, now, didn’t want to go down
stairs to dinner, but Mr. R. persuaded her and we had a very good time
indeed. By 8 o’clock we were down again and bought a fifteen-dollar box
in the Madison Square Garden (Rogers bought it, not I,) then he went and
fetched Dr. Rice while I (went) to the Players and picked up two
artists–Reid and Simmons–and thus we filled 5 of the 6 seats. There was
a vast multitude of people in the brilliant place. Stanford White came
along presently and invited me to go to the World-Champion’s dressing
room, which I was very glad to do. Corbett has a fine face and is modest
and diffident, besides being the most perfectly and beautifully
constructed human animal in the world. I said:</p>
<p>“You have whipped Mitchell, and maybe you will whip Jackson in
June–but you are not done, then. You will have to tackle me.“</p>
<p>He answered, so gravely that one might easily have thought him in
earnest:</p>
<p>“No–I am not going to meet you in the ring. It is not fair or right
to require it. You might chance to knock me out, by no merit of your
own, but by a purely accidental blow; and then my reputation would be
gone and you would have a double one. You have got fame enough and you
ought not to want to take mine away from me.“</p>
<p>Corbett was for a long time a clerk in the Nevada Bank in San
Francisco.</p>
<p>There were lots of little boxing matches, to entertain the crowd:
then at last Corbett appeared in the ring and the 8,000 people present
went mad with enthusiasm. My two artists went mad about his form. They
said they had never seen anything that came reasonably near equaling its
perfection except Greek statues, and they didn’t surpass it.</p>
<p>Corbett boxed 3 rounds with the middle-weight Australian champion–oh,
beautiful to see!–then the show was over and we struggled out through a
perfect wash of humanity. When we reached the street I found I had left
my arctics in the box. I had to have them, so Simmons said he would go
back and get them, and I didn’t dissuade him. I couldn’t see how he was
going to make his way a single yard into that solid oncoming wave of
people–yet he must plow through it full 50 yards. He was back with the
shoes in 3 minutes!</p>
<p>How do you reckon he accomplished that miracle? By saying:</p>
<p>“Way, gentlemen, please–coming to fetch Mr. Corbett’s overshoes.“</p>
<p>The word flew from mouth to mouth, the Red Sea divided, and Simmons
walked comfortably through and back, dry shod. Simmons (this was
revealed to me under seal of secrecy by Reid) is the hero of “Gwen,“ and
he and Gwen’s author were once engaged to marry. This is “fire-escape“
Simmons, the inveterate talker, you know: “Exit–in case of Simmons.“</p>
<p>I had an engagement at a beautiful dwelling close to the Players for
10.30; I was there by 10.45. Thirty cultivated and very musical ladies
and gentlemen present–all of them acquaintances and many of them
personal friends of mine. That wonderful Hungarian Band was there (they
charge 00 for an evening.) Conversation and Band until midnight; then a
bite of supper; then the company was compactly grouped before me and I
told about Dr. B. E. Martin and the etchings, and followed it with the
Scotch-Irish Christening. My, but the Martin is a darling story! Next,
the head tenor from the Opera sang half a dozen great songs that set the
company wild, yes, mad with delight, that nobly handsome young Damrosch
accompanying on the piano.</p>
<p>Just a little pause–then the Band burst out into an explosion of
weird and tremendous dance music, a Hungarian celebrity and his wife
took the floor–I followed; I couldn’t help it; the others drifted in,
one by one, and it was Onteora over again.</p>
<p>By half past 4 I had danced all those people down–and yet was not
tired; merely breathless. I was in bed at 5, and asleep in ten minutes.
Up at 9 and presently at work on this letter to you. I think I wrote
until 2 or half past. Then I walked leisurely out to Mr. Rogers’s (it is
called 3 miles but it is short of it) arriving at 3.30, but he was out
–to return at 5.30–(and a person was in, whom I don’t particularly like)
–so I didn’t stay, but dropped over and chatted with the Howellses until
6.</p>
<p>First, Howells and I had a chat together. I asked about Mrs. H. He
said she was fine, still steadily improving, and nearly back to her old
best health. I asked (as if I didn’t know):</p>
<p>“What do you attribute this strange miracle to?“</p>
<p>“Mind-cure–simply mind-cure.“</p>
<p>“Lord, what a conversion! You were a scoffer three months ago.“</p>
<p>“I? I wasn’t.“</p>
<p>“You were. You made elaborate fun of me in this very room.“</p>
<p>“I did not, Clemens.“</p>
<p>“It’s a lie, Howells, you did.“</p>
<p>I detailed to him the conversation of that time–with the stately
argument furnished by Boyesen in the fact that a patient had actually
been killed by a mind-curist; and Howells’s own smart remark that when
the mind-curist is done with you, you have to call in a “regular“ at
last because the former can’t procure you a burial permit.</p>
<p>At last he gave in–he said he remembered that talk, but had now been
a mind-curist so long it was difficult for him to realize that he had
ever been anything else.</p>
<p>Mrs. H. came skipping in, presently, the very person, to a dot, that
she used to be, so many years ago.</p>
<p>Mrs. H. said: “People may call it what they like, but it is just
hypnotism, and that’s all it is–hypnotism pure and simple. Mind-cure!
–the idea! Why, this woman that cured me hasn’t got any mind. She’s a
good creature, but she’s dull and dumb and illiterate and–“</p>
<p>“Now Eleanor!“</p>
<p>“I know what I’m talking about!–don’t I go there twice a week? And
Mr. Clemens, if you could only see her wooden and satisfied face when
she snubs me for forgetting myself and showing by a thoughtless remark
that to me weather is still weather, instead of being just an
abstraction and a superstition–oh, it’s the funniest thing you ever saw!
A-n-d-when she tilts up her nose-well, it’s–it’s–Well it’s that kind of
a nose that–“</p>
<p>“Now Eleanor!–the woman is not responsible for her nose–“ and so-on
and so-on. It didn’t seem to me that I had any right to be having this
feast and you not there.</p>
<p>She convinced me before she got through, that she and William James
are right–hypnotism and mind-cure are the same thing; no difference
between them. Very well; the very source, the very center of hypnotism
is Paris. Dr. Charcot’s pupils and disciples are right there and ready
to your hand without fetching poor dear old Susy across the stormy sea.
Let Mrs. Mackay (to whom I send my best respects), tell you whom to go
to to learn all you need to learn and how to proceed. Do, do it, honey.
Don’t lose a minute.</p>
<p>…..At 11 o’clock last night Mr. Rogers said:</p>
<p>“I am able to feel physical fatigue–and I feel it now. You never show
any, either in your eyes or your movements; do you ever feel any?“</p>
<p>I was able to say that I had forgotten what that feeling was like.
Don’t you remember how almost impossible it was for me to tire myself at
the Villa? Well, it is just so in New York. I go to bed unfatigued at 3,
I get up fresh and fine six hours later. I believe I have taken only one
daylight nap since I have been here.</p>
<p>When the anchor is down, then I shall say:</p>
<p>“Farewell–a long farewell–to business! I will never touch it
again!“</p>
<p>I will live in literature, I will wallow in it, revel in it, I will
swim in ink! Joan of Arc–but all this is premature; the anchor is not
down yet.</p>
<p>To-morrow (Tuesday) I will add a P. S. if I’ve any to add; but,
whether or no, I must mail this to morrow, for the mail steamer goes
next day.</p>
<p>5.30 p. m. Great Scott, this is Tuesday! I must rush this letter into
the mail instantly.</p>
<p>Tell that sassy Ben I’ve got her welcome letter, and I’ll write her
as soon as I get a daylight chance. I’ve most time at night, but I’d
druther write daytimes. SAML.</p>
<p>The Reid and Simmons mentioned in the foregoing were Robert Reid and
Edward Simmons, distinguished painter–the latter a brilliant, fluent,
and industrious talker. The title; “Fire-escape Simmons,“ which Clemens
gives him, originated when Oliver Herford, whose quaint wit has so long
delighted New-Yorkers, one day pinned up by the back door of the Players
the notice: “Exit in case of Simmons.“ Gwen, a popular novel of that
day, was written by Blanche Willis Howard.</p>
<p>“Jamie“ Dodge, in the next letter, was the son of Mrs. Mary Mapes
Dodge, editor of St. Nicholas.</p>
<p>To Clara Clemens, in Paris:</p>
<p>MR. ROGERS’S OFFICE, Feb. 5, ’94. Dear Benny–I was intending to
answer your letter to-day, but I am away down town, and will simply
whirl together a sentence or two for good-fellowship. I have bought
photographs of Coquelin and Jane Hading and will ask them to sign them.
I shall meet Coquelin tomorrow night, and if Hading is not present I
will send her picture to her by somebody.</p>
<p>I am to breakfast with Madame Nordica in a few days, and meantime I
hope to get a good picture of her to sign. She was of the breakfast
company yesterday, but the picture of herself which she signed and gave
me does not do her majestic beauty justice.</p>
<p>I am too busy to attend to the photo-collecting right, because I have
to live up to the name which Jamie Dodge has given me–the “Belle of New
York“–and it just keeps me rushing. Yesterday I had engagements to
breakfast at noon, dine at 3, and dine again at 7. I got away from the
long breakfast at 2 p. m., went and excused myself from the 3 o’clock
dinner, then lunched with Mrs. Dodge in 58th street, returned to the
Players and dressed, dined out at 9, and was back at Mrs. Dodge’s at 10
p. m. where we had magic-lantern views of a superb sort, and a lot of
yarns until an hour after midnight, and got to bed at 2 this morning –a
good deal of a gain on my recent hours. But I don’t get tired; I sleep
as sound as a dead person, and always wake up fresh and strong –usually
at exactly 9.</p>
<p>I was at breakfast lately where people of seven separate
nationalities sat and the seven languages were going all the time. At my
side sat a charming gentleman who was a delightful and active talker,
and interesting. He talked glibly to those folks in all those seven
languages and still had a language to spare! I wanted to kill him, for
very envy.</p>
<p>I greet you with love and kisses. PAPA.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Paris:</p>
<p>Feb.–. Livy dear, last night I played billiards with Mr. Rogers until
11, then went to Robert Reid’s studio and had a most delightful time
until 4 this morning. No ladies were invited this time. Among the people
present were–</p>
<p>Coquelin; Richard Harding Davis; Harrison, the great out-door
painter; Wm. H. Chase, the artist; Bettini, inventor of the new
phonograph. Nikola Tesla, the world-wide illustrious electrician; see
article about him in Jan. or Feb. Century. John Drew, actor; James
Barnes, a marvelous mimic; my, you should see him! Smedley the artist;
Zorn the artist; Zogbaum the artist; Reinhart the artist; Metcalf the
artist; Ancona, head tenor at the Opera;</p>
<p>Oh, a great lot of others. Everybody there had done something and was
in his way famous.</p>
<p>Somebody welcomed Coquelin in a nice little French speech; John Drew
did the like for me in English, and then the fun began. Coquelin did
some excellent French monologues–one of them an ungrammatical Englishman
telling a colorless historiette in French. It nearly killed the fifteen
or twenty people who understood it.</p>
<p>I told a yarn, Ancona sang half a dozen songs, Barnes did his darling
imitations, Harding Davis sang the hanging of Danny Deever, which was of
course good, but he followed it with that most fascinating (for what
reason I don’t know) of all Kipling’s poems, “On the Road to Mandalay,“
sang it tenderly, and it searched me deeper and charmed me more than the
Deever.</p>
<p>Young Gerrit Smith played some ravishing dance music and we all
danced about an hour. There couldn’t be a pleasanter night than that one
was. Some of those people complained of fatigue but I don’t seem to know
what the sense of fatigue is.</p>
<p>Coquelin talks quite good English now. He said:</p>
<p>“I have a brother who has the fine mind–ah, a charming and delicate
fancy, and he knows your writings so well, and loves them–and that is
the same with me. It will stir him so when I write and tell him I have
seen you!“</p>
<p>Wasn’t that nice? We talked a good deal together. He is as winning as
his own face. But he wouldn’t sign that photograph for Clara. “That? No!
She shall have a better one. I will send it to you.“</p>
<p>He is much driven, and will forget it, but Reid has promised to get
the picture for me, and I will try and keep him reminded.</p>
<p>Oh, dear, my time is all used up and your letters are not
answered.</p>
<p>Mama, dear, I don’t go everywhere–I decline most things. But there
are plenty that I can’t well get out of.</p>
<p>I will remember what you say and not make my yarning too common.</p>
<p>I am so glad Susy has gone on that trip and that you are trying the
electric. May you both prosper. For you are mighty dear to me and in my
thoughts always. SAML.</p>
<p>The affairs of the Webster Publishing Company were by this time
getting into a very serious condition indeed. The effects of the panic
of the year before could not be overcome. Creditors were pressing their
claims and profits were negligible. In the following letter we get a
Mark Twain estimate of the great financier who so cheerfully was willing
to undertake the solving of Mark Twain’s financial problems.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Paris:</p>
<p>THE PLAYERS, Feb. 15, ’94. 11.30 p. m. Livy darling, Yesterday I
talked all my various matters over with Mr. Rogers and we decided that
it would be safe for me to leave here the 7th of March, in the New York.
So his private secretary, Miss Harrison, wrote and ordered a berth for
me and then I lost no time in cabling you that I should reach
Southampton March 14, and Paris the 15th. Land, but it made my pulses
leap, to think I was going to see you again!….. One thing at a time. I
never fully laid Webster’s disastrous condition before Mr. Rogers until
to-night after billiards. I did hate to burden his good heart and
over-worked head with it, but he took hold with avidity and said it was
no burden to work for his friends, but a pleasure. We discussed it from
various standpoints, and found it a sufficiently difficult problem to
solve; but he thinks that after he has slept upon it and thought it over
he will know what to suggest.</p>
<p>You must not think I am ever rude with Mr. Rogers, I am not. He is
not common clay, but fine–fine and delicate–and that sort do not call
out the coarsenesses that are in my sort. I am never afraid of wounding
him; I do not need to watch myself in that matter. The sight of him is
peace.</p>
<p>He wants to go to Japan–it is his dream; wants to go with me–which
means, the two families–and hear no more about business for awhile, and
have a rest. And he needs it. But it is like all the dreams of all busy
men–fated to remain dreams.</p>
<p>You perceive that he is a pleasant text for me. It is easy to write
about him. When I arrived in September, lord how black the prospect was
–how desperate, how incurably desperate! Webster and Co had to have a
small sum of money or go under at once. I flew to Hartford–to my
friends–but they were not moved, not strongly interested, and I was
ashamed that I went. It was from Mr. Rogers, a stranger, that I got the
money and was by it saved. And then–while still a stranger–he set
himself the task of saving my financial life without putting upon me (in
his native delicacy) any sense that I was the recipient of a charity, a
benevolence–and he has accomplished that task; accomplished it at a cost
of three months of wearing and difficult labor. He gave that time to
me–time which could not be bought by any man at a hundred thousand
dollars a month–no, nor for three times the money.</p>
<p>Well, in the midst of that great fight, that long and admirable
fight, George Warner came to me and said:</p>
<p>“There is a splendid chance open to you. I know a man–a prominent man
–who has written a book that will go like wildfire; a book that arraigns
the Standard Oil fiends, and gives them unmitigated hell, individual by
individual. It is the very book for you to publish; there is a fortune
in it, and I can put you in communication with the author.“</p>
<p>I wanted to say:</p>
<p>“The only man I care for in the world; the only man I would give a
damn for; the only man who is lavishing his sweat and blood to save me
and mine from starvation and shame, is a Standard Oil fiend. If you know
me, you know whether I want the book or not.“</p>
<p>But I didn’t say that. I said I didn’t want any book; I wanted to get
out of the publishing business and out of all business, and was here for
that purpose and would accomplish it if I could.</p>
<p>But there’s enough. I shall be asleep by 3, and I don’t need much
sleep, because I am never drowsy or tired these days. Dear, dear Susy my
strength reproaches me when I think of her and you, my darling.</p>
<p>SAML.</p>
<p>But even so able a man as Henry Rogers could not accomplish the
impossible. The affairs of the Webster Company were hopeless, the
business was not worth saving. By Mr. Rogers’s advice an assignment was
made April, 18, 1894. After its early spectacular success less than ten
years had brought the business to failure. The publication of the Grant
memoirs had been its only great achievement.</p>
<p>Clemens would seem to have believed that the business would resume,
and for a time Rogers appears to have comforted him in his hope, but we
cannot believe that it long survived. Young Hall, who had made such a
struggle for its salvation, was eager to go on, but he must presently
have seen the futility of any effort in that direction.</p>
<p>Of course the failure of Mark Twain’s firm made a great stir in the
country, and it is easy to understand that loyal friends would rally in
his behalf.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Clemens, in Paris:</p>
<p>April 22, ’94. Dear old darling, we all think the creditors are going
to allow us to resume business; and if they do we shall pull through and
pay the debts. I am prodigiously glad we made an assignment. And also
glad that we did not make it sooner. Earlier we should have made a poor
showing; but now we shall make a good one.</p>
<p>I meet flocks of people, and they all shake me cordially by the hand
and say “I was so sorry to hear of the assignment, but so glad you did
it. It was around, this long time, that the concern was tottering, and
all your friends were afraid you would delay the assignment too
long.“</p>
<p>John Mackay called yesterday, and said, “Don’t let it disturb you,
Sam –we all have to do it, at one time or another; it’s nothing to be
ashamed of.“</p>
<p>One stranger out in New York State sent me a dollar bill and thought
he would like to get up a dollar-subscription for me. And Poultney
Bigelow’s note came promptly, with his check for ,000. I had been
meeting him every day at the Club and liking him better and better all
the time. I couldn’t take his money, of course, but I thanked him
cordially for his good will.</p>
<p>Now and then a good and dear Joe Twichell or Susy Warner condoles
with me and says “Cheer up–don’t be downhearted,“ and some other friend
says, “I am glad and surprised to see how cheerful you are and how
bravely you stand it“–and none of them suspect what a burden has been
lifted from me and how blithe I am inside. Except when I think of you,
dear heart–then I am not blithe; for I seem to see you grieving and
ashamed, and dreading to look people in the face. For in the thick of
the fight there is cheer, but you are far away and cannot hear the drums
nor see the wheeling squadrons. You only seem to see rout, retreat, and
dishonored colors dragging in the dirt–whereas none of these things
exist. There is temporary defeat, but no dishonor–and we will march
again. Charley Warner said to-day, “Sho, Livy isn’t worrying. So long as
she’s got you and the children she doesn’t care what happens. She knows
it isn’t her affair.“ Which didn’t convince me.</p>
<p>Good bye my darling, I love you and all of the kids–and you can tell
Clara I am not a spitting gray kitten. SAML.</p>
<p>Clemens sailed for Europe as soon as his affairs would permit him to
go. He must get settled where he could work comfortably. Type-setter
prospects seemed promising, but meantime there was need of funds.</p>
<p>He began writing on the ship, as was his habit, and had completed his
article on Fenimore Cooper by the time he reached London. In August we
find him writing to Mr. Rogers from Etretat, a little Norman
watering-place.</p>
<p>To H. H. Rogers, in New York:</p>
<p>ETRETAT, (NORMANDIE) CHALET DES ABRIS Aug. 25, ’94. DEAR MR.
ROGERS,–I find the Madam ever so much better in health and strength. The
air is superb and soothing and wholesome, and the Chalet is remote from
noise and people, and just the place to write in. I shall begin work
this afternoon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens is in great spirits on, account of the benefit which she
has received from the electrical treatment in Paris and is bound to take
it up again and continue it all the winter, and of course I am perfectly
willing. She requires me to drop the lecture platform out of my mind and
go straight ahead with Joan until the book is finished. If I should have
to go home for even a week she means to go with me–won’t consent to be
separated again–but she hopes I won’t need to go.</p>
<p>I tell her all right, “I won’t go unless you send, and then I
must.“</p>
<p>She keeps the accounts; and as she ciphers it we can’t get crowded
for money for eight months yet. I didn’t know that. But I don’t know
much anyway. Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The reader may remember that Clemens had written the first half of
his Joan of Arc book at the Villa Viviani, in Florence, nearly two years
before. He had closed the manuscript then with the taking of Orleans,
and was by no means sure that he would continue the story beyond that
point. Now, however, he was determined to reach the tale’s tragic
conclusion.</p>
<p>To H. H. Rogers, in New York:</p>
<p>ETRETAT, Sunday, Sept. 9, ’94. DEAR MR. ROGERS, I drove the quill too
hard, and I broke down–in my head. It has now been three days since I
laid up. When I wrote you a week ago I had added 10,000 words or
thereabout to Joan. Next day I added 1,500 which was a proper enough
day’s work though not a full one; but during Tuesday and Wednesday I
stacked up an aggregate of 6,000 words–and that was a very large
mistake. My head hasn’t been worth a cent since.</p>
<p>However, there’s a compensation; for in those two days I reached and
passed–successfully–a point which I was solicitous about before I ever
began the book: viz., the battle of Patay. Because that would naturally
be the next to the last chapter of a work consisting of either two books
or one. In the one case one goes right along from that point (as I shall
do now); in the other he would add a wind-up chapter and make the book
consist of Joan’s childhood and military career alone.</p>
<p>I shall resume work to-day; and hereafter I will not go at such an
intemperate’ rate. My head is pretty cobwebby yet.</p>
<p>I am hoping that along about this time I shall hear that the machine
is beginning its test in the Herald office. I shall be very glad indeed
to know the result of it. I wish I could be there. Sincerely yours S. L.
CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Rouen, where Joan met her martyrdom, was only a short distance away,
and they halted there en route to Paris, where they had arranged to
spend the winter. The health of Susy Clemens was not good, and they
lingered in Rouen while Clemens explored the old city and incidentally
did some writing of another sort. In a note to Mr. Rogers he said: “To
put in my odd time I am writing some articles about Paul Bourget and his
Outre-Mer chapters–laughing at them and at some of our oracular owls who
find them important. What the hell makes them important, I should like
to know!“</p>
<p>He was still at Rouen two weeks later and had received encouraging
news from Rogers concerning the type-setter, which had been placed for
trial in the office of the Chicago Herald. Clemens wrote: “I can hardly
keep from sending a hurrah by cable. I would certainly do it if I wasn’t
superstitious.“ His restraint, though wise, was wasted the end was
near.</p>
<p>To H. H. Rogers, in New York:</p>
<p>169 RUE DE L’UNIVERSITE, PARIS, Dec. 22; ’94. DEAR MR. ROGERS,–I
seemed to be entirely expecting your letter, and also prepared and
resigned; but Lord, it shows how little we know ourselves and how easily
we can deceive ourselves. It hit me like a thunder-clap. It knocked
every rag of sense out of my head, and I went flying here and there and
yonder, not knowing what I was doing, and only one clearly defined
thought standing up visible and substantial out of the crazy storm-drift
that my dream of ten years was in desperate peril, and out of the 60,000
or 90,000 projects for its rescue that came floating through my skull,
not one would hold still long enough for me to examine it and size it
up. Have you ever been like that? Not so much so, I reckon.</p>
<p>There was another clearly defined idea–I must be there and see it
die. That is, if it must die; and maybe if I were there we might hatch
up some next-to-impossible way to make it take up its bed and take a
walk.</p>
<p>So, at the end of four hours I started, still whirling and walked
over to the rue Scribe–4 P. M.–and asked a question or two and was told
I should be running a big risk if I took the 9 P. M. train for London
and Southampton; “better come right along at 6.52 per Havre special and
step aboard the New York all easy and comfortable.“ Very! and I about
two miles from home, with no packing done.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to me that none of these salvation-notions that were
whirl-winding through my head could be examined or made available unless
at least a month’s time could be secured. So I cabled you, and said to
myself that I would take the French steamer tomorrow (which will be
Sunday).</p>
<p>By bedtime Mrs. Clemens had reasoned me into a fairly rational and
contented state of mind; but of course it didn’t last long. So I went on
thinking–mixing it with a smoke in the dressing room once an hour–until
dawn this morning. Result–a sane resolution; no matter what your answer
to my cable might be, I would hold still and not sail until I should get
an answer to this present letter which I am now writing, or a cable
answer from you saying “Come“ or “Remain.“</p>
<p>I have slept 6 hours, my pond has clarified, and I find the sediment
of my 70,000 projects to be of this character:</p>
<p>[Several pages of suggestions for reconstructing the machine
follow.]</p>
<p>Don’t say I’m wild. For really I’m sane again this morning.</p>
<p>………………….</p>
<p>I am going right along with Joan, now, and wait untroubled till I
hear from you. If you think I can be of the least use, cable me “Come.“
I can write Joan on board ship and lose no time. Also I could discuss my
plan with the publisher for a deluxe Joan, time being an object, for
some of the pictures could be made over here cheaply and quickly, but
would cost much time and money in America.</p>
<p>………………….</p>
<p>If the meeting should decide to quit business Jan. 4, I’d like to
have Stoker stopped from paying in any more money, if Miss Harrison
doesn’t mind that disagreeable job. And I’ll have to write them, too, of
course. With love, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The “Stoker“ of this letter was Bram Stoker, long associated with Sir
Henry Irving. Irving himself had also taken stock in the machine. The
address, 169 Rue de l’Universite, whence these letters are written, was
the beautiful studio home of the artist Pomroy which they had taken for
the winter.</p>
<p>To H. H. Rogers, in New York:</p>
<p>169 RUE DE L’UNIVERSITE, PARIS, Dec. 27, ’94. DEAR MR.
ROGERS,–Notwithstanding your heart is “old and hard,“ you make a body
choke up. I know you “mean every word you say“ and I do take it “in the
same spirit in which you tender it.“ I shall keep your regard while we
two live–that I know; for I shall always remember what you have done for
me, and that will insure me against ever doing anything that could
forfeit it or impair it. I am 59 years old; yet I never had a friend
before who put out a hand and tried to pull me ashore when he found me
in deep waters.</p>
<p>It is six days or seven days ago that I lived through that despairing
day, and then through a night without sleep; then settled down next day
into my right mind (or thereabouts,) and wrote you. I put in the rest of
that day till 7 P. M. plenty comfortably enough writing a long chapter
of my book; then went to a masked ball blacked up as Uncle Remus, taking
Clara along; and we had a good time. I have lost no day since and
suffered no discomfort to speak of, but drove my troubles out of my mind
and had good success in keeping them out–through watchfulness. I have
done a good week’s work and put the book a good way ahead in the Great
Trial, which is the difficult part which requires the most thought and
carefulness. I cannot see the end of the Trial yet, but I am on the
road. I am creeping surely toward it.</p>
<p>“Why not leave them all to me.“ My business bothers? I take you by
the hand! I jump at the chance!</p>
<p>I ought to be ashamed and I am trying my best to be ashamed–and yet I
do jump at the chance in spite of it. I don’t want to write Irving and I
don’t want to write Stoker. It doesn’t seem as if I could. But I can
suggest something for you to write them; and then if you see that I am
unwise, you can write them something quite different. Now this is my
idea:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>To return Stoker’s 00 to him and keep his stock.</p></li>
<li><p>And tell Irving that when luck turns with me I will make good to
him what the salvage from the dead Co. fails to pay him of his
00.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>P. S. Madam says No, I must face the music. So I enclose my effort to
be used if you approve, but not otherwise.</p>
<p>There! Now if you will alter it to suit your judgment and bang away,
I shall be eternally obliged.</p>
<p>We shall try to find a tenant for our Hartford house; not an easy
matter, for it costs heavily to live in. We can never live in it again;
though it would break the family’s hearts if they could believe it.</p>
<p>Nothing daunts Mrs. Clemens or makes the world look black to
her–which is the reason I haven’t drowned myself.</p>
<p>We all send our deepest and warmest greetings to you and all of yours
and a Happy New Year! S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Enclosure:</p>
<p>MY DEAR STOKER,–I am not dating this because it is not to be mailed
at present.</p>
<p>When it reaches you it will mean that there is a hitch in my
machine-enterprise–a hitch so serious as to make it take to itself the
aspect of a dissolved dream. This letter, then, will contain cheque for
the 00 which you have paid. And will you tell Irving for me–I can’t get
up courage enough to talk about this misfortune myself, except to you,
whom by good luck I haven’t damaged yet that when the wreckage presently
floats ashore he will get a good deal of his 00 back; and a dab at a
time I will make up to him the rest.</p>
<p>I’m not feeling as fine as I was when I saw you there in your home.
Please remember me kindly to Mrs. Stoker. I gave up that London
lecture-project entirely. Had to–there’s never been a chance since to
find the time. Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
