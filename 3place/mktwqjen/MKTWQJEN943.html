OF 1905. TO TWICHELL, MR. DUNEKA AND OTHERS. POLITICS AND HUMANITY. A
SUMMER AT DUBLIN. MARK TWAIN AT 70</h4>
<p>In 1884 Mark Twain had abandoned the Republican Party to vote for
Cleveland. He believed the party had become corrupt, and to his last day
it was hard for him to see anything good in Republican policies or
performance. He was a personal friend of Thedore Roosevelt’s but, as we
have seen in a former letter, Roosevelt the politician rarely found
favor in his eyes. With or without justification, most of the
President’s political acts invited his caustic sarcasm and unsparing
condemnation. Another letter to Twichell of this time affords a fair
example.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>Feb. 16, ’05. DEAR JOE,–I knew I had in me somewhere a definite
feeling about the President if I could only find the words to define it
with. Here they are, to a hair–from Leonard Jerome: “For twenty years I
have loved Roosevelt the man and hated Roosevelt the statesman and
politician.“</p>
<p>It’s mighty good. Every time, in 25 years, that I have met Roosevelt
the man, a wave of welcome has streaked through me with the hand-grip;
but whenever (as a rule) I meet Roosevelt the statesman and politician,
I find him destitute of morals and not respectworthy. It is plain that
where his political self and his party self are concerned he has nothing
resembling a conscience; that under those inspirations he is naively
indifferent to the restraints of duty and even unaware of them; ready to
kick the Constitution into the back yard whenever it gets in the way;
and whenever he smells a vote, not only willing but eager to buy it,
give extravagant rates for it and pay the bill not out of his own pocket
or the party’s, but out of the nation’s, by cold pillage. As per Order
78 and the appropriation of the Indian trust funds.</p>
<p>But Roosevelt is excusable–I recognize it and (ought to) concede it.
We are all insane, each in his own way, and with insanity goes
irresponsibility. Theodore the man is sane; in fairness we ought to keep
in mind that Theodore, as statesman and politician, is insane and
irresponsible.</p>
<p>Do not throw these enlightenments aside, but study them, let them
raise you to higher planes and make you better. You taught me in my
callow days, let me pay back the debt now in my old age out of a
thesaurus with wisdom smelted from the golden ores of experience. Ever
yours for sweetness and light MARK.</p>
<p>The next letter to Twichell takes up politics and humanity in
general, in a manner complimentary to neither. Mark Twain was never
really a pessimist, but he had pessimistic intervals, such as come to
most of us in life’s later years, and at such times he let himself go
without stint concerning “the damned human race,“ as he called it,
usually with a manifest sense of indignation that he should be a member
of it. In much of his later writing –A Mysterious Stranger for
example–he said his say with but small restraint, and certainly in his
purely intellectual moments he was likely to be a pessimist of the most
extreme type, capably damning the race and the inventor of it. Yet, at
heart, no man loved his kind more genuinely, or with deeper compassion,
than Mark Twain, perhaps for its very weaknesses. It was only that he
had intervals –frequent intervals, and rather long ones–when he did not
admire it, and was still more doubtful as to the ways of providence.</p>
<p>To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:</p>
<p>March 14, ’05. DEAR JOE,–I have a Puddn’head maxim:</p>
<p>“When a man is a pessimist before 48 he knows too much; if he is an
optimist after it, he knows too little.“</p>
<p>It is with contentment, therefore, that I reflect that I am better
and wiser than you. Joe, you seem to be dealing in “bulks,“ now; the
“bulk“ of the farmers and U. S. Senators are “honest.“ As regards
purchase and sale with money? Who doubts it? Is that the only measure of
honesty? Aren’t there a dozen kinds of honesty which can’t be measured
by the money-standard? Treason is treason–and there’s more than one form
of it; the money-form is but one of them. When a person is disloyal to
any confessed duty, he is plainly and simply dishonest, and knows it;
knows it, and is privately troubled about it and not proud of himself.
Judged by this standard–and who will challenge the validity of it?–there
isn’t an honest man in Connecticut, nor in the Senate, nor anywhere
else. I do not even except myself, this time.</p>
<p>Am I finding fault with you and the rest of the populace? No–I assure
you I am not. For I know the human race’s limitations, and this makes it
my duty–my pleasant duty–to be fair to it. Each person in it is honest
in one or several ways, but no member of it is honest in all the ways
required by–by what? By his own standard. Outside of that, as I look at
it, there is no obligation upon him.</p>
<p>Am I honest? I give you my word of honor (private) I am not. For
seven years I have suppressed a book which my conscience tells me I
ought to publish. I hold it a duty to publish it. There are other
difficult duties which I am equal to, but I am not equal to that one.
Yes, even I am dishonest. Not in many ways, but in some. Forty-one, I
think it is. We are certainly all honest in one or several ways–every
man in the world–though I have reason to think I am the only one whose
black-list runs so light. Sometimes I feel lonely enough in this lofty
solitude.</p>
<p>Yes, oh, yes, I am not overlooking the “steady progress from age to
age of the coming of the kingdom of God and righteousness.“ “From age to
age“–yes, it describes that giddy gait. I (and the rocks) will not live
to see it arrive, but that is all right–it will arrive, it surely will.
But you ought not to be always ironically apologizing for the Deity. If
that thing is going to arrive, it is inferable that He wants it to
arrive; and so it is not quite kind of you, and it hurts me, to see you
flinging sarcasms at the gait of it. And yet it would not be fair in me
not to admit that the sarcasms are deserved. When the Deity wants a
thing, and after working at it for “ages and ages“ can’t show even a
shade of progress toward its accomplishment, we–well, we don’t laugh,
but it is only because we dasn’t. The source of “righteousness“–is in
the heart? Yes. And engineered and directed by the brain? Yes. Well,
history and tradition testify that the heart is just about what it was
in the beginning; it has undergone no shade of change. Its good and evil
impulses and their consequences are the same today that they were in Old
Bible times, in Egyptian times, in Greek times, in Middle Age times, in
Twentieth Century times. There has been no change.</p>
<p>Meantime, the brain has undergone no change. It is what it always
was. There are a few good brains and a multitude of poor ones. It was so
in Old Bible times and in all other times–Greek, Roman, Middle Ages and
Twentieth Century. Among the savages–all the savages–the average brain
is as competent as the average brain here or elsewhere. I will prove it
to you, some time, if you like. And there are great brains among them,
too. I will prove that also, if you like.</p>
<p>Well, the 19th century made progress–the first progress after “ages
and ages“–colossal progress. In what? Materialities. Prodigious
acquisitions were made in things which add to the comfort of many and
make life harder for as many more. But the addition to righteousness? Is
that discoverable? I think not. The materialities were not invented in
the interest of righteousness; that there is more righteousness in the
world because of them than there, was before, is hardly demonstrable, I
think. In Europe and America, there is a vast change (due to them) in
ideals–do you admire it? All Europe and all America, are feverishly
scrambling for money. Money is the supreme ideal–all others take tenth
place with the great bulk of the nations named. Money-lust has always
existed, but not in the history of the world was it ever a craze, a
madness, until your time and mine. This lust has rotted these nations;
it has made them hard, sordid, ungentle, dishonest, oppressive.</p>
<p>Did England rise against the infamy of the Boer war? No–rose in favor
of it. Did America rise against the infamy of the Phillipine war? No
–rose in favor of it. Did Russia rise against the infamy of the present
war? No–sat still and said nothing. Has the Kingdom of God advanced in
Russia since the beginning of time?</p>
<p>Or in Europe and America, considering the vast backward step of the
money-lust? Or anywhere else? If there has been any progress toward
righteousness since the early days of Creation–which, in my ineradicable
honesty, I am obliged to doubt–I think we must confine it to ten per
cent of the populations of Christendom, (but leaving, Russia, Spain and
South America entirely out.) This gives us 320,000,000 to draw the ten
per cent from. That is to say, 32,000,000 have advanced toward
righteousness and the Kingdom of God since the “ages and ages“ have been
flying along, the Deity sitting up there admiring. Well, you see it
leaves 1,200,000,000 out of the race. They stand just where they have
always stood; there has been no change.</p>
<p>N. B. No charge for these informations. Do come down soon, Joe. With
love, MARK.</p>
<p>St. Clair McKelway, of The Brooklyn Eagle, narrowly escaped injuries
in a railway accident, and received the following. Clemens and McKelway
were old friends.</p>
<p>To St. Clair McKelway, in Brooklyn:</p>
<p>21 FIFTH AVE. Sunday Morning. April 30, 1905. DEAR McKELWAY, Your
innumerable friends are grateful, most grateful.</p>
<p>As I understand the telegrams, the engineer of your train had never
seen a locomotive before. Very well, then, I am once more glad that
there is an Ever-watchful Providence to foresee possible results and
send Ogdens and McIntyres along to save our friends.</p>
<p>The Government’s Official report, showing that our railways killed
twelve hundred persons last year and injured sixty thousand convinces me
that under present conditions one Providence is not enough to properly
and efficiently take care of our railroad business. But it is
characteristically American–always trying to get along short-handed and
save wages.</p>
<p>I am helping your family congratulate themselves, and am your friend
as always. S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Clemens did not spend any more summers at Quarry Farm. All its
associations were beautiful and tender, but they could only sadden him.
The life there had been as of another world, sunlit, idyllic, now
forever vanished. For the summer of 1905 he leased the Copley Green
house at Dublin, New Hampshire, where there was a Boston colony of
writing and artistic folk, including many of his long-time friends.
Among them was Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who wrote a hearty
letter of welcome when he heard the news. Clemens replied in kind.</p>
<p>To Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, in Boston:</p>
<p>21 FIFTH AVE. Sunday, March 26, z9o.5. DEAR COL. HIGGINSON,–I early
learned that you would be my neighbor in the Summer and I rejoiced,
recognizing in you and your family a large asset. I hope for frequent
intercourse between the two households. I shall have my youngest
daughter with me. The other one will go from the rest-cure in this city
to the rest-cure in Norfolk Conn and we shall not see her before autumn.
We have not seen her since the middle of October.</p>
<p>Jean (the youngest daughter) went to Dublin and saw the house and
came back charmed with it. I know the Thayers of old–manifestly there is
no lack of attractions up there. Mrs. Thayer and I were shipmates in a
wild excursion perilously near 40 years ago.</p>
<p>You say you “send with this“ the story. Then it should be here but it
isn’t, when I send a thing with another thing, the other thing goes but
the thing doesn’t, I find it later–still on the premises. Will you look
it up now and send it?</p>
<p>Aldrich was here half an hour ago, like a breeze from over the
fields, with the fragrance still upon his spirit. I am tired of waiting
for that man to get old. Sincerely yours, S. L. C.</p>
<p>Mark Twain was in his seventieth year, old neither in mind nor body,
but willing to take life more quietly, to refrain from travel and gay
events. A sort of pioneers’ reunion was to be held on the Pacific Coast,
and a letter from Robert Fulton, of Reno, Nevada, invited Clemens to
attend. He did not go, but he sent a letter that we may believe was the
next best thing to those who heard it read.</p>
<p>To Robert Fulton, in Reno, Nevada:</p>
<p>IN THE MOUNTAINS, May 24, 1905. DEAR MR. FULTON,–I remember, as if it
were yesterday, that when I disembarked from the overland stage in front
of the Ormsby in Carson City in August, 1861, I was not expecting to be
asked to come again. I was tired, discouraged, white with alkali dust,
and did not know anybody; and if you had said then, “Cheer up, desolate
stranger, don’t be down-hearted–pass on, and come again in 1905,“ you
cannot think how grateful I would have been and how gladly I would have
closed the contract. Although I was not expecting to be invited, I was
watching out for it, and was hurt and disappointed when you started to
ask me and changed it to, “How soon are you going away?“</p>
<p>But you have made it all right, now, the wound is closed. And so I
thank you sincerely for the invitation; and with you, all Reno, and if I
were a few years younger I would accept it, and promptly. I would go. I
would let somebody else do the oration, but, as for me, I would talk
–just talk. I would renew my youth; and talk–and talk–and talk –and have
the time of my life! I would march the unforgotten and unforgettable
antiques by, and name their names, and give them reverent
Hailand-farewell as they passed: Goodman, McCarthy, Gillis, Curry,
Baldwin, Winters, Howard, Nye, Stewart; Neely Johnson, Hal Clayton,
North, Root,–and my brother, upon whom be peace!–and then the
desperadoes, who made life a joy and the “Slaughter-house“ a precious
possession: Sam Brown, Farmer Pete, Bill Mayfield, Six-fingered Jake,
Jack Williams and the rest of the crimson discipleship–and so on and so
on. Believe me, I would start a resurrection it would do you more good
to look at than the next one will, if you go on the way you are doing
now.</p>
<p>Those were the days! those old ones. They will come no more. Youth
will come no more. They were so full to the brim with the wine of life;
there have been no others like them. It chokes me up to think of them.
Would you like me to come out there and cry? It would not beseem my
white head.</p>
<p>Good-bye. I drink to you all. Have a good time–and take an old man’s
blessing. MARK TWAIN.</p>
<p>A few days later he was writing to H. H. Bancroft, of San Francisco,
who had invited him for a visit in event of his coming to the Coast.
Henry James had just been there for a week and it was hoped that Howells
would soon follow.</p>
<p>To H. H. Bancroft, in San Francisco:</p>
<p>UP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, May 27, 1905. DEAR MR. BANCROFT,–I thank you
sincerely for the tempting hospitalities which you offer me, but I have
to deny myself, for my wandering days are over, and it is my desire and
purpose to sit by the fire the rest of my remnant of life and indulge
myself with the pleasure and repose of work –work uninterrupted and
unmarred by duties or excursions.</p>
<p>A man who like me, is going to strike 70 on the 30th of next November
has no business to be flitting around the way Howells does–that
shameless old fictitious butter fly. (But if he comes, don’t tell him I
said it, for it would hurt him and I wouldn’t brush a flake of powder
from his wing for anything. I only say it in envy of his indestructible
youth, anyway. Howells will be 88 in October.) With thanks again,
Sincerely yours, S. L. C.</p>
<p>Clemens found that the air of the New Hampshire hills agreed with him
and stimulated him to work. He began an entirely new version of The
Mysterious Stranger, of which he already had a bulky and nearly finished
manuscript, written in Vienna. He wrote several hundred pages of an
extravaganza entitled, Three Thousand Years Among the Microbes, and
then, having got his superabundant vitality reduced (it was likely to
expend itself in these weird mental exploits), he settled down one day
and wrote that really tender and beautiful idyl, Eve’s Diary, which he
had begun, or at least planned, the previous summer at Tyringham. In a
letter to Mr. Frederick A. Duneka, general manager of Harper
andandandand Brothers, he tells something of the manner of the story;
also his revised opinion of Adam’s Diary, written in ’93, and originally
published as a souvenir of Niagara Falls.</p>
<p>To Frederick A. Duneka, in New York:</p>
<p>DUBLIN, July 16, ’05. DEAR MR. DUNEKA,–I wrote Eve’s Diary, she using
Adam’s Diary as her (unwitting and unconscious) text, of course, since
to use any other text would have been an imbecility–then I took Adam’s
Diary and read it. It turned my stomach. It was not literature; yet it
had been literature once–before I sold it to be degraded to an
advertisement of the Buffalo Fair. I was going to write and ask you to
melt the plates and put it out of print.</p>
<p>But this morning I examined it without temper, and saw that if I
abolished the advertisement it would be literature again.</p>
<p>So I have done it. I have struck out 700 words and inserted 5 MS
pages of new matter (650 words), and now Adam’s Diary is dam good–sixty
times as good as it ever was before.</p>
<p>I believe it is as good as Eve’s Diary now–no, it’s not quite that
good, I guess, but it is good enough to go in the same cover with Eve’s.
I’m sure of that.</p>
<p>I hate to have the old Adam go out any more–don’t put it on the
presses again, let’s put the new one in place of it; and next Xmas, let
us bind Adam and Eve in one cover. They score points against each
other–so, if not bound together, some of the points would not be
perceived…..</p>
<p>P. S. Please send another Adam’s Diary, so that I can make 2 revised
copies. Eve’s Diary is Eve’s love-Story, but we will not name it that.
Yrs ever, MARK.</p>
<p>The peace-making at Portsmouth between Japan and Russia was not
satisfactory to Mark Twain, who had fondly hoped there would be no peace
until, as he said, “Russian liberty was safe. One more battle would have
abolished the waiting chains of millions upon millions of unborn
Russians and I wish it could have been fought.“ He set down an
expression of his feelings for the Associated Press, and it invited many
letters. Charles Francis Adams wrote, “It attracted my attention because
it so exactly expresses the views I have myself all along
entertained.“</p>
<p>Clemens was invited by Colonel George Harvey to dine with the Russian
emissaries, Baron Rosen and Sergius Witte. He declined, but his telegram
so pleased Witte that he asked permission to publish it, and announced
that he would show it to the Czar.</p>
<p>Telegram. To Col. George Harvey, in New York:</p>
<p>TO COLONEL HARVEY,–I am still a cripple, otherwise I should be more
than glad of this opportunity to meet the illustrious magicians who came
here equipped with nothing but a pen, and with it have divided the
honors of the war with the sword. It is fair to presume that in thirty
centuries history will not get done admiring these men who attempted
what the world regarded as impossible and achieved it.</p>
<p>Witte would not have cared to show the Czar the telegram in its
original form, which follows.</p>
<p>Telegram (unsent). To Col. George Harvey, in New York:</p>
<p>TO COLONEL HARVEY,–I am still a cripple, otherwise I should be more
than glad of this opportunity to meet those illustrious magicians who
with the pen have annulled, obliterated, and abolished every high
achievement of the Japanese sword and turned the tragedy of a tremendous
war into a gay and blithesome comedy. If I may, let me in all respect
and honor salute them as my fellow-humorists, I taking third place, as
becomes one who was not born to modesty, but by diligence and hard work
is acquiring it. MARK.</p>
<p>Nor still another unsent form, perhaps more characteristic than
either of the foregoing.</p>
<p>Telegram (unsent). To Col. George Harvey, in New York:</p>
<p>DEAR COLONEL,–No, this is a love-feast; when you call a lodge of
sorrow send for me. MARK.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Crane, Quarry Farm:</p>
<p>DUBLIN, Sept. 24, ’05. Susy dear, I have had a lovely dream. Livy,
dressed in black, was sitting up in my bed (here) at my right and
looking as young and sweet as she used to do when she was in health. She
said: “what is the name of your sweet sister?“ I said, “Pamela.“ “Oh,
yes, that is it, I thought it was–“ (naming a name which has escaped me)
“Won’t you write it down for me?“ I reached eagerly for a pen and
pad–laid my hands upon both–then said to myself, “It is only a dream,“
and turned back sorrowfully and there she was, still. The conviction
flamed through me that our lamented disaster was a dream, and this a
reality. I said, “How blessed it is, how blessed it is, it was all a
dream, only a dream!“ She only smiled and did not ask what dream I
meant, which surprised me. She leaned her head against mine and I kept
saying, “I was perfectly sure it was a dream, I never would have
believed it wasn’t.“</p>
<p>I think she said several things, but if so they are gone from my
memory. I woke and did not know I had been dreaming. She was gone. I
wondered how she could go without my knowing it, but I did not spend any
thought upon that, I was too busy thinking of how vivid and real was the
dream that we had lost her and how unspeakably blessed it was to find
that it was not true and that she was still ours and with us. S. L.
C.</p>
<p>One day that summer Mark Twain received a letter from the actress,
Minnie Maddern Fiske, asking him to write something that would aid her
in her crusade against bull-fighting. The idea appealed to him; he
replied at once.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Fiske:</p>
<p>DEAR MRS. FISKE,–I shall certainly write the story. But I may not get
it to suit me, in which case it will go in the fire. Later I will try
again–and yet again–and again. I am used to this. It has taken me twelve
years to write a short story–the shortest one I ever wrote, I
think.–[Probably “The Death Disk.“]–So do not be discouraged; I will
stick to this one in the same way. Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>He did not delay in his beginning, and a few weeks later was sending
word to his publisher about it.</p>
<p>To Frederick A. Duneka, in New York:</p>
<p>Oct. 2, ’05. DEAR MR. DUNEKA,–I have just finished a short story
which I “greatly admire,“ and so will you–“A Horse’s Tale“–about 15,000
words, at a rough guess. It has good fun in it, and several characters,
and is lively. I shall finish revising it in a few days or more, then
Jean will type it.</p>
<p>Don’t you think you can get it into the Jan. and Feb. numbers and
issue it as a dollar booklet just after the middle of Jan. when you
issue the Feb. number?</p>
<p>It ought to be ably illustrated.</p>
<p>Why not sell simultaneous rights, for this once, to the Ladies’ Home
Journal or Collier’s, or both, and recoup yourself?–for I would like to
get it to classes that can’t afford Harper’s. Although it doesn’t
preach, there’s a sermon concealed in it. Yr sincerely, MARK.</p>
<p>Five days later he added some rather interesting facts concerning the
new story.</p>
<p>To F. A. Duneka, in New York:</p>
<p>Oct. 7, 1906. [’05] DEAR MR. DUNEKA,–….. I’ve made a poor guess as to
number of words. I think there must be 20,000. My usual page of MS.
contains about 130 words; but when I am deeply interested in my work and
dead to everything else, my hand-writing shrinks and shrinks until
there’s a great deal more than 130 on a page–oh, yes, a deal more. Well,
I discover, this morning, that this tale is written in that small
hand.</p>
<p>This strong interest is natural, for the heroine is my daughter,
Susy, whom we lost. It was not intentional–it was a good while before I
found it out.</p>
<p>So I am sending you her picture to use–and to reproduce with
photographic exactness the unsurpassable expression and all. May you
find an artist who has lost an idol!</p>
<p>Take as good care of the picture as you can and restore it to me when
I come.</p>
<p>I hope you will illustrate this tale considerably. Not humorous
pictures. No. When they are good (or bad) one’s humor gets no chance to
play surprises on the reader. A humorous subject illustrated seriously
is all right, but a humorous artist is no fit person for such work. You
see, the humorous writer pretends to absolute seriousness (when he knows
his trade) then for an artist–to step in and give his calculated gravity
all away with a funny picture–oh, my land! It gives me the dry gripes
just to think of it. It would be just about up to the average comic
artist’s intellectual level to make a funny picture of the horse kicking
the lungs out of a trader. Hang it, the remark is funny–because the
horse is not aware of it but the fact is not humorous, it is tragic and
it is no subject for a humorous picture.</p>
<p>Could I be allowed to sit in judgment upon the pictures before they
are accepted–at least those in which Cathy may figure?</p>
<p>This is not essential. It is but a suggestion, and it is hereby
withdrawn, if it would be troublesome or cause delay.</p>
<p>I hope you will reproduce the cat-pile, full page. And save the photo
for me in as good condition as possible. When Susy and Clara were little
tots those cats had their profoundest worship, and there is no duplicate
of this picture. These cats all had thundering names, or inappropriate
ones–furnished by the children with my help. One was named Buffalo
Bill.</p>
<p>Are you interested in coincidences?</p>
<p>After discovering, about the middle of the book, that Cathy was Susy
Clemens, I put her picture with my MS., to be reproduced. After the book
was finished it was discovered that Susy had a dim model of Soldier Boy
in her arms; I had forgotten all about that toy.</p>
<p>Then I examined the cat-picture and laid it with the MS. for
introduction; but it was not until yesterday that I remembered that one
of the cats was named Buffalo Bill. Sincerely yours, MARK.</p>
<p>The reference in this letter to shrinkage of his hand-writing with
the increasing intensity of his interest, and the consequent addition of
the number of words to the page, recalls another fact, noted by
Mr. Duneka, viz.: that because of his terse Anglo-Saxon diction, Mark
Twain could put more words on a magazine page than any other writer. It
is hardly necessary to add that he got more force into what he put on
the page for the same reason.</p>
<p>There was always a run of reporters at Mark Twain’s New York home.
His opinion was sought for on every matter of public interest, and
whatever happened to him in particular was considered good for at least
half a column of copy, with his name as a catch-line at the top. When it
was learned that he was to spend the summer in New Hampshire, the
reporters had all wanted to find out about it. Now that the summer was
ending, they began to want to know how he had liked it, what work he had
done and what were his plans for another year. As they frequently
applied to his publishers for these details it was finally suggested to
him that he write a letter furnishing the required information. His
reply, handed to Mr. Duneka, who was visiting him at the moment, is full
of interest.</p>
<p>Mem. for Mr. Duneka:</p>
<p>DUBLIN, Oct. 9, 1905. …..As to the other matters, here are the
details.</p>
<p>Yes, I have tried a number of summer homes, here and in Europe
together.</p>
<p>Each of these homes had charms of its own; charms and delights of its
own, and some of them–even in Europe had comforts. Several of them had
conveniences, too. They all had a “view.“</p>
<p>It is my conviction that there should always be some water in a view
–a lake or a river, but not the ocean, if you are down on its level. I
think that when you are down on its level it seldom inflames you with an
ecstasy which you could not get out of a sand-flat. It is like being on
board ship, over again; indeed it is worse than that, for there’s three
months of it. On board ship one tires of the aspects in a couple of
days, and quits looking. The same vast circle of heaving humps is spread
around you all the time, with you in the centre of it and never gaining
an inch on the horizon, so far as you can see; for variety, a flight of
flying-fish, mornings; a flock of porpoises throwing summersaults
afternoons; a remote whale spouting, Sundays; occasional phosphorescent
effects, nights; every other day a streak of black smoke trailing along
under the horizon; on the one single red letter day, the illustrious
iceberg. I have seen that iceberg thirty-four times in thirty-seven
voyages; it is always the same shape, it is always the same size, it
always throws up the same old flash when the sun strikes it; you may set
it on any New York door-step of a June morning and light it up with a
mirror-flash; and I will engage to recognize it. It is artificial, and
it is provided and anchored out by the steamer companies. I used to like
the sea, but I was young then, and could easily get excited over any
kind of monotony, and keep it up till the monotonies ran out, if it was
a fortnight.</p>
<p>Last January, when we were beginning to inquire about a home for this
summer, I remembered that Abbott Thayer had said, three years before,
that the New Hampshire highlands was a good place. He was right–it was a
good place. Any place that is good for an artist in paint is good for an
artist in morals and ink. Brush is here, too; so is Col. T. W.
Higginson; so is Raphael Pumpelly; so is Mr. Secretary Hitchcock; so is
Henderson; so is Learned; so is Summer; so is Franklin MacVeigh; so is
Joseph L. Smith; so is Henry Copley Greene, when I am not occupying his
house, which I am doing this season. Paint, literature, science,
statesmanship, history, professorship, law, morals,–these are all
represented here, yet crime is substantially unknown.</p>
<p>The summer homes of these refugees are sprinkled, a mile apart, among
the forest-clad hills, with access to each other by firm smooth country
roads which are so embowered in dense foliage that it is always twilight
in there, and comfortable. The forests are spider-webbed with these good
roads, they go everywhere; but for the help of the guide-boards, the
stranger would not arrive anywhere.</p>
<p>The village–Dublin–is bunched together in its own place, but a good
telephone service makes its markets handy to all those outliars. I have
spelt it that way to be witty. The village executes orders on, the
Boston plan–promptness and courtesy.</p>
<p>The summer homes are high-perched, as a rule, and have contenting
outlooks. The house we occupy has one. Monadnock, a soaring double hump,
rises into the sky at its left elbow–that is to say, it is close at
hand. From the base of the long slant of the mountain the valley spreads
away to the circling frame of the hills, and beyond the frame the
billowy sweep of remote great ranges rises to view and flows, fold upon
fold, wave upon wave, soft and blue and unwordly, to the horizon fifty
miles away. In these October days Monadnock and the valley and its
framing hills make an inspiring picture to look at, for they are
sumptuously splashed and mottled and be-torched from sky-line to
sky-line with the richest dyes the autumn can furnish; and when they lie
flaming in the full drench of the mid-afternoon sun, the sight affects
the spectator physically, it stirs his blood like military music.</p>
<p>These summer homes are commodious, well built, and well
furnished–facts which sufficiently indicate that the owners built them
to live in themselves. They have furnaces and wood fireplaces, and the
rest of the comforts and conveniences of a city home, and can be
comfortably occupied all the year round.</p>
<p>We cannot have this house next season, but I have secured
Mrs. Upton’s house which is over in the law and science quarter, two or
three miles from here, and about the same distance from the art,
literary, and scholastic groups. The science and law quarter has needed
improving, this good while.</p>
<p>The nearest railway-station is distant something like an hour’s
drive; it is three hours from there to Boston, over a branch line. You
can go to New York in six hours per branch lines if you change cars
every time you think of it, but it is better to go to Boston and stop
over and take the trunk line next day, then you do not get lost.</p>
<p>It is claimed that the atmosphere of the New Hampshire highlands is
exceptionally bracing and stimulating, and a fine aid to hard and
continuous work. It is a just claim, I think. I came in May, and wrought
35 successive days without a break. It is possible that I could not have
done it elsewhere. I do not know; I have not had any disposition to try
it, before. I think I got the disposition out of the atmosphere, this
time. I feel quite sure, in fact, that that is where it came from.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to confess what an intolerable pile of manuscript I
ground out in the 35 days, therefore I will keep the number of words to
myself. I wrote the first half of a long tale–“The Adventures of a
Microbe“ and put it away for a finish next summer, and started another
long tale–“The Mysterious Stranger;“ I wrote the first half of it and
put it with the other for a finish next summer. I stopped, then. I was
not tired, but I had no books on hand that needed finishing this year
except one that was seven years old. After a little I took that one up
and finished it. Not for publication, but to have it ready for revision
next summer.</p>
<p>Since I stopped work I have had a two months’ holiday. The summer has
been my working time for 35 years; to have a holiday in it (in America)
is new for me. I have not broken it, except to write “Eve’s Diary“ and
“A Horse’s Tale“–short things occupying the mill 12 days.</p>
<p>This year our summer is 6 months long and ends with November and the
flight home to New York, but next year we hope and expect to stretch it
another month and end it the first of December.</p>
<p>[No signature.]</p>
<p>The fact that he was a persistent smoker was widely known, and many
friends and admirers of Mark Twain sent him cigars, most of which he
could not use, because they were too good. He did not care for Havana
cigars, but smoked the fragrant, inexpensive domestic tobacco with
plenty of “pep“ in it, as we say today. Now and then he had an
opportunity to head off some liberal friend, who wrote asking permission
to contribute to his cigar collection, as instance the following.</p>
<p>To Rev. L. M. Powers, in Haverhill, Mass.:</p>
<p>Nov. 9, 1905. DEAR MR. POWERS,–I should accept your hospitable offer
at once but for the fact I couldn’t do it and remain honest. That is to
say if I allowed you to send me what you believe to be good cigars it
would distinctly mean that I meant to smoke them, whereas I should do
nothing of the kind. I know a good cigar better than you do, for I have
had 60 years experience.</p>
<p>No, that is not what I mean; I mean I know a bad cigar better than
anybody else; I judge by the price only; if it costs above 5 cents I
know it to be either foreign or half-foreign, and unsmokeable. By me. I
have many boxes of Havana cigars, of all prices from 20 cts apiece up to
1.66 apiece; I bought none of them, they were all presents, they are an
accumulation of several years. I have never smoked one of them and never
shall, I work them off on the visitor. You shall have a chance when you
come.</p>
<p>Pessimists are born not made; optimists are born not made; but no man
is born either pessimist wholly or optimist wholly, perhaps; he is
pessimistic along certain lines and optimistic along certain others.
That is my case. Sincerely yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>In spite of all the fine photographs that were made of him, there
recurred constantly among those sent him to be autographed a print of
one which, years before, Sarony had made and placed on public sale. It
was a good photograph, mechanically and even artistically, but it did
not please Mark Twain. Whenever he saw it he recalled Sarony with
bitterness and severity. Once he received an inquiry concerning it, and
thus feelingly expressed himself.</p>
<p>To Mr. Row (no address):</p>
<p>21 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK, November 14, 1905. DEAR MR. ROW,–That
alleged portrait has a private history. Sarony was as much of an
enthusiast about wild animals as he was about photography; and when Du
Chaillu brought the first Gorilla to this country in 1819 he came to me
in a fever of excitement and asked me if my father was of record and
authentic. I said he was; then Sarony, without any abatement of his
excitement asked if my grandfather also was of record and authentic. I
said he was. Then Sarony, with still rising excitement and with joy
added to it, said he had found my great grandfather in the person of the
gorilla, and had recognized him at once by his resemblance to me. I was
deeply hurt but did not reveal this, because I knew Saxony meant no
offense for the gorilla had not done him any harm, and he was not a man
who would say an unkind thing about a gorilla wantonly. I went with him
to inspect the ancestor, and examined him from several points of view,
without being able to detect anything more than a passing resemblance.
“Wait,“ said Sarony with confidence, “let me show you.“ He borrowed my
overcoat–and put it on the gorilla. The result was surprising. I saw
that the gorilla while not looking distinctly like me was exactly what
my great grand father would have looked like if I had had one. Sarong
photographed the creature in that overcoat, and spread the picture about
the world. It has remained spread about the world ever since. It turns
up every week in some newspaper somewhere or other. It is not my
favorite, but to my exasperation it is everybody else’s. Do you think
you could get it suppressed for me? I will pay the limit. Sincerely
yours, S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>The year 1905 closed triumphantly for Mark Twain. The great
“Seventieth Birthday“ dinner planned by Colonel George Harvey is
remembered to-day as the most notable festival occasion in New York
literary history. Other dinners and ovations followed. At seventy he had
returned to the world, more beloved, more honored than ever before.</p>
