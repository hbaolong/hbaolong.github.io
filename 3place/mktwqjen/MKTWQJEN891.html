<h4 id="san-francisco-earthquake">SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE</h4>
<p>After the address at the Robert Fulton Fund meeting, June 19, 1906,
Mr. Clemens talked to the assembled reporters about the San Francisco
earthquake.</p>
<p>I haven’t been there since 1868, and that great city of San Francisco
has grown up since my day. When I was there she had one hundred and
eighteen thousand people, and of this number eighteen thousand were
Chinese. I was a reporter on the Virginia City Enterprise in Nevada in
1862, and stayed there, I think, about two years, when I went to San
Francisco and got a job as a reporter on The Call. I was there three or
four years.</p>
<p>I remember one day I was walking down Third Street in San Francisco.
It was a sleepy, dull Sunday afternoon, and no one was stirring.
Suddenly as I looked up the street about three hundred yards the whole
side of a house fell out. The street was full of bricks and mortar. At
the same time I was knocked against the side of a house, and stood there
stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>I thought it was an earthquake. Nobody else had heard anything about
it and no one said earthquake to me afterward, but I saw it and I wrote
it. Nobody else wrote it, and the house I saw go into the street was the
only house in the city that felt it. I’ve always wondered if it wasn’t a
little performance gotten up for my especial entertainment by the nether
regions.</p>
<p>CHARITY AND ACTORS</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE ACTORS’ FUND FAIR IN THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE, NEW
YORK, MAY 6, 1907</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens, in his white suit, formally declared the fair open.
Mr. Daniel Frohman, in introducing Mr. Clemens, said:</p>
<p>“We intend to make this a banner week in the history of the Fund,
which takes an interest in every one on the stage, be he actor, singer,
dancer, or workman. We have spent more than 0,000 during the past year.
Charity covers a multitude of sins, but it also reveals a multitude of
virtues. At the opening of the former fair we had the assistance of
Edwin Booth and Joseph Jefferson. In their place we have to-day that
American institution and apostle of wide humanity–Mark Twain.“</p>
<p>As Mr. Frohman has said, charity reveals a multitude of virtues. This
is true, and it is to be proved here before the week is over.
Mr. Frohman has told you something of the object and something of the
character of the work. He told me he would do this–and he has kept his
word! I had expected to hear of it through the newspapers. I wouldn’t
trust anything between Frohman and the newspapers–except when it’s a
case of charity!</p>
<p>You should all remember that the actor has been your benefactor many
and many a year. When you have been weary and downcast he has lifted
your heart out of gloom and given you a fresh impulse. You are all under
obligation to him. This is your opportunity to be his benefactor–to help
provide for him in his old age and when he suffers from infirmities.</p>
<p>At this fair no one is to be persecuted to buy. If you offer a
twenty-dollar bill in payment for a purchase of you will receive 9 in
change. There is to be no robbery here. There is to be no creed here –no
religion except charity. We want to raise 50,000–and that is a great
task to attempt.</p>
<p>The President has set the fair in motion by pressing the button in
Washington. Now your good wishes are to be transmuted into cash.</p>
<p>By virtue of the authority in me vested I declare the fair open. I
call the ball game. Let the transmuting begin!</p>
<p>RUSSIAN REPUBLIC</p>
<p>The American auxiliary movement to aid the cause of freedom in Russia
was launched on the evening of April 11, 1906, at the Club A house, 3
Fifth Avenue, with Mr. Clemens and Maxim Gorky as the principal
spokesmen. Mr. Clemens made an introductory address, presenting
Mr. Gorky.</p>
<p>If we can build a Russian republic to give to the persecuted people
of the Tsar’s domain the same measure of freedom that we enjoy, let us
go ahead and do it. We need not discuss the methods by which that
purpose is to be attained. Let us hope that fighting will be postponed
or averted for a while, but if it must come–</p>
<p>I am most emphatically in sympathy with the movement, now on foot in
Russia, to make that country free. I am certain that it will be
successful, as it deserves to be. Any such movement should have and
deserves our earnest and unanimous co-operation, and such a petition for
funds as has been explained by Mr. Hunter, with its just and powerful
meaning, should have the utmost support of each and every one of us.
Anybody whose ancestors were in this country when we were trying to free
ourselves from oppression, must sympathize with those who now are trying
to do the same thing in Russia.</p>
<p>The parallel I have just drawn only goes to show that it makes no
difference whether the oppression is bitter or not; men with red, warm
blood in their veins will not endure it, but will seek to cast it off.
If we keep our hearts in this matter Russia will be free.</p>
<p>RUSSIAN SUFFERERS</p>
<p>On December 18, 1905, an entertainment was given at the Casino for
the benefit of the Russian sufferers. After the performance Mr. Clemens
spoke.</p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,–It seems a sort of cruelty to inflict upon an
audience like this our rude English tongue, after we have heard that
divine speech flowing in that lucid Gallic tongue.</p>
<p>It has always been a marvel to me–that French language; it has always
been a puzzle to me. How beautiful that language is. How expressive it
seems to be. How full of grace it is.</p>
<p>And when it comes from lips like those, how eloquent and how liquid
it is. And, oh, I am always deceived–I always think I am going to
understand it.</p>
<p>Oh, it is such a delight to me, such a delight to me, to meet Madame
Bernhardt, and laugh hand to hand and heart to heart with her.</p>
<p>I have seen her play, as we all have, and oh, that is divine; but I
have always wanted to know Madame Bernhardt herself–her fiery self. I
have wanted to know that beautiful character.</p>
<p>Why, she is the youngest person I ever saw, except myself–for I
always feel young when I come in the presence of young people.</p>
<p>I have a pleasant recollection of an incident so many years ago–when
Madame Bernhardt came to Hartford, where I lived, and she was going to
play and the tickets were three dollars, and there were two lovely women
–a widow and her daughter–neighbors of ours, highly cultivated ladies
they were; their tastes were fine and elevated, but they were very poor,
and they said “Well, we must not spend six dollars on a pleasure of the
mind, a pleasure of the intellect; we must spend it, if it must go at
all, to furnish to somebody bread to eat.“</p>
<p>And so they sorrowed over the fact that they had to give up that
great pleasure of seeing Madame Bernhardt, but there were two neighbors
equally highly cultivated and who could not afford bread, and those
good-hearted Joneses sent that six dollars–deprived themselves of it–and
sent it to those poor Smiths to buy bread with. And those Smiths took it
and bought tickets with it to see Madame Bernhardt.</p>
<p>Oh yes, some people have tastes and intelligence also.</p>
<p>Now, I was going to make a speech–I supposed I was, but I am not. It
is late, late; and so I am going to tell a story; and there is this
advantage about a story, anyway, that whatever moral or valuable thing
you put into a speech, why, it gets diffused among those involuted
sentences and possibly your audience goes away without finding out what
that valuable thing was that you were trying to confer upon it; but,
dear me, you put the same jewel into a story and it becomes the keystone
of that story, and you are bound to get it–it flashes, it flames, it is
the jewel in the toad’s head–you don’t overlook that.</p>
<p>Now, if I am going to talk on such a subject as, for instance, the
lost opportunity–oh, the lost opportunity. Anybody in this house who has
reached the turn of life–sixty, or seventy, or even fifty, or along
there–when he goes back along his history, there he finds it mile-stoned
all the way with the lost opportunity, and you know how pathetic that
is.</p>
<p>You younger ones cannot know the full pathos that lies in those words
–the lost opportunity; but anybody who is old, who has really lived and
felt this life, he knows the pathos of the lost opportunity.</p>
<p>Now, I will tell you a story whose moral is that, whose lesson is
that, whose lament is that.</p>
<p>I was in a village which is a suburb of New Bedford several years ago
–well, New Bedford is a suburb of Fair Haven, or perhaps it is the other
way; in any case, it took both of those towns to make a great centre of
the great whaling industry of the first half of the nineteenth century,
and I was up there at Fair Haven some years ago with a friend of
mine.</p>
<p>There was a dedication of a great town-hall, a public building, and
we were there in the afternoon. This great building was filled, like
this great theatre, with rejoicing villagers, and my friend and I
started down the centre aisle. He saw a man standing in that aisle, and
he said “Now, look at that bronzed veteran–at that mahogany-faced man.
Now, tell me, do you see anything about that man’s face that is
emotional? Do you see anything about it that suggests that inside that
man anywhere there are fires that can be started? Would you ever imagine
that that is a human volcano?“</p>
<p>“Why, no,“ I said, “I would not. He looks like a wooden Indian in
front of a cigar store.“</p>
<p>“Very well,“ said my friend, “I will show you that there is emotion
even in that unpromising place. I will just go to that man and I will
just mention in the most casual way an incident in his life. That man is
getting along toward ninety years old. He is past eighty. I will mention
an incident of fifty or sixty years ago. Now, just watch the effect, and
it will be so casual that if you don’t watch you won’t know when I do
say that thing–but you just watch the effect.“</p>
<p>He went on down there and accosted this antiquity, and made a remark
or two. I could not catch up. They were so casual I could not recognize
which one it was that touched that bottom, for in an instant that old
man was literally in eruption and was filling the whole place with
profanity of the most exquisite kind. You never heard such accomplished
profanity. I never heard it also delivered with such eloquence.</p>
<p>I never enjoyed profanity as I enjoyed it then–more than if I had
been uttering it myself. There is nothing like listening to an
artist–all his passions passing away in lava, smoke, thunder, lightning,
and earthquake.</p>
<p>Then this friend said to me: “Now, I will tell you about that. About
sixty years ago that man was a young fellow of twenty-three, and had
just come home from a three years’ whaling voyage. He came into that
village of his, happy and proud because now, instead of being chief
mate, he was going to be master of a whaleship, and he was proud and
happy about it.</p>
<p>“Then he found that there had been a kind of a cold frost come upon
that town and the whole region roundabout; for while he had been away
the Father Mathew temperance excitement had come upon the whole region.
Therefore, everybody had taken the pledge; there wasn’t anybody for
miles and miles around that had not taken the pledge.</p>
<p>“So you can see what a solitude it was to this young man, who was
fond of his grog. And he was just an outcast, because when they found he
would not join Father Mathew’s Society they ostracized him, and he went
about that town three weeks, day and night, in utter loneliness–the only
human being in the whole place who ever took grog, and he had to take it
privately.</p>
<p>“If you don’t know what it is to be ostracized, to be shunned by your
fellow-man, may you never know it. Then he recognized that there was
something more valuable in this life than grog, and that is the
fellowship of your fellow-man. And at last he gave it up, and at nine
o’clock one night he went down to the Father Mathew Temperance Society,
and with a broken heart he said: ‘Put my name down for membership in
this society.’</p>
<p>“And then he went away crying, and at earliest dawn the next morning
they came for him and routed him out, and they said that new ship of his
was ready to sail on a three years’ voyage. In a minute he was on board
that ship and gone.</p>
<p>“And he said–well, he was not out of sight of that town till he began
to repent, but he had made up his mind that he would not take a drink,
and so that whole voyage of three years was a three years’ agony to that
man because he saw all the time the mistake he had made.</p>
<p>“He felt it all through; he had constant reminders of it, because the
crew would pass him with their grog, come out on the deck and take it,
and there was the torturous Smell of it.</p>
<p>“He went through the whole, three years of suffering, and at last
coming into port it was snowy, it was cold, he was stamping through the
snow two feet deep on the deck and longing to get home, and there was
his crew torturing him to the last minute with hot grog, but at last he
had his reward. He really did get to shore at fast, and jumped and ran
and bought a jug and rushed to the society’s office, and said to the
secretary:</p>
<p>“‘Take my name off your membership books, and do it right away! I
have got a three years’ thirst on.’</p>
<p>“And the secretary said: ‘It is not necessary. You were
blackballed!’“</p>
<p>WATTERSON AND TWAIN AS REBELS</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE CELEBRATION OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN’S 92D BIRTHDAY
ANNIVERSARY, CARNEGIE HALL, FEBRUARY 11, 1901, TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE
LINCOLN MEMORIAL UNIVERSITY AT CUMBERLAND GAP, TENN.</p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,–The remainder of my duties as presiding
chairman here this evening are but two–only two. One of them is easy,
and the other difficult. That is to say, I must introduce the orator,
and then keep still and give him a chance. The name of Henry Watterson
carries with it its own explanation. It is like an electric light on top
of Madison Square Garden; you touch the button and the light flashes up
out of the darkness. You mention the name of Henry Watterson, and your
minds are at once illuminated with the splendid radiance of his fame and
achievements. A journalist, a soldier, an orator, a statesman, a rebel.
Yes, he was a rebel; and, better still, now he is a reconstructed
rebel.</p>
<p>It is a curious circumstance, a circumstance brought about without
any collusion or prearrangement, that he and I, both of whom were rebels
related by blood to each other, should be brought here together this
evening bearing a tribute in our hands and bowing our heads in reverence
to that noble soul who for three years we tried to destroy. I don’t know
as the fact has ever been mentioned before, but it is a fact,
nevertheless. Colonel Watterson and I were both rebels, and we are blood
relations. I was a second lieutenant in a Confederate company for a
while–oh, I could have stayed on if I had wanted to. I made myself felt,
I left tracks all around the country. I could have stayed on, but it was
such weather. I never saw such weather to be out-of-doors in, in all my
life.</p>
<p>The Colonel commanded a regiment, and did his part, I suppose, to
destroy the Union. He did not succeed, yet if he had obeyed me he would
have done so. I had a plan, and I fully intended to drive General Grant
into the Pacific Ocean–if I could get transportation. I told Colonel
Watterson about it. I told him what he had to do. What I wanted him to
do was to surround the Eastern army and wait until I came up. But he was
insubordinate; he stuck on some quibble of military etiquette about a
second lieutenant giving orders to a colonel or something like that. And
what was the consequence? The Union was preserved. This is the first
time I believe that that secret has ever been revealed.</p>
<p>No one outside of the family circle, I think, knew it before; but
there the facts are. Watterson saved the Union; yes, he saved the Union.
And yet there he sits, and not a step has been taken or a movement made
toward granting him a pension. That is the way things are done. It is a
case where some blushing ought to be done. You ought to blush, and I
ought to blush, and he–well, he’s a little out of practice now.</p>
<p>ROBERT FULTON FUND</p>
<p>ADDRESS MADE ON THE EVENING OF APRIL 19, 1906</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens had been asked to address the association by
Gen. Frederick D. Grant, president. He was offered a fee of ,000, but
refused it, saying:</p>
<p>“I shall be glad to do it, but I must stipulate that you keep the
,000, and add it to the Memorial Fund as my contribution to erect a
monument in New York to the memory of the man who applied steam to
navigation.“</p>
<p>At this meeting Mr. Clemens made this formal announcement from the
platform:</p>
<p>“This is my last appearance on the paid platform. I shall not retire
from the gratis platform until I am buried, and courtesy will compel me
to keep still and not disturb the others. Now, since I must, I shall say
good-bye. I see many faces in this audience well known to me. They are
all my friends, and I feel that those I don’t know are my friends, too.
I wish to consider that you represent the nation, and that in saying
good-bye to you I am saying good-bye to the nation. In the great name of
humanity, let me say this final word: I offer an appeal in behalf of
that vast, pathetic multitude of fathers, mothers, and helpless little
children. They were sheltered and happy two days ago. Now they are
wandering, forlorn, hopeless, and homeless, the victims of a great
disaster. So I beg of you, I beg of you, to open your hearts and open
your purses and remember San Francisco, the smitten city.“</p>
<p>I wish to deliver a historical address. I’ve been studying the
history of—er–a–let me see–a [then he stopped in confusion, and walked
over to Gen. Fred D. Grant, who sat at the head of the platform. He
leaned over an a whisper, and then returned to the front of the stage
and continued]. Oh yes! I’ve been studying Robert Fulton. I’ve been
studying a biographical sketch of Robert Fulton, the inventor of–er–a
–let’s see–ah yes, the inventor of the electric telegraph and the Morse
sewing–machine. Also, I understand he invented the air–diria–pshaw! I
have it at last–the dirigible balloon. Yes, the dirigible–but it is a
difficult word, and I don’t see why anybody should marry a couple of
words like that when they don’t want to be married at all and are likely
to quarrel with each other all the time. I should put that couple of
words under the ban of the United States Supreme Court, under its
decision of a few days ago, and take ’em out and drown ’em.</p>
<p>I used to know Fulton. It used to do me good to see him dashing
through tile town on a wild broncho.</p>
<p>And Fulton was born in—er–a–Well, it doesn’t make much difference
where he was born, does it? I remember a man who came to interview me
once, to get a sketch of my life. I consulted with a friend–a practical
man–before he came, to know how I should treat him.</p>
<p>“Whenever you give the interviewer a fact,“ he said, “give him
another fact that will contradict it. Then he’ll go away with a jumble
that he can’t use at all. Be gentle, be sweet, smile like an idiot–just
be natural.“ That’s what my friend told me to do, and I did it.</p>
<p>“Where were you born?“ asked the interviewer.</p>
<p>“Well-er-a,“ I began, “I was born in Alabama, or Alaska, or the
Sandwich Islands; I don’t know where, but right around there somewhere.
And you had better put it down before you forget it.“</p>
<p>“But you weren’t born in all those places,“ he said.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve offered you three places. Take your choice. They’re all
at the same price.“</p>
<p>“How old are you?“ he asked.</p>
<p>“I shall be nineteen in June,“ I said.</p>
<p>“Why, there’s such a discrepancy between your age and your looks,“ he
said.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s nothing,“ I said, “I was born discrepantly.“</p>
<p>Then we got to talking about my brother Samuel, and he told me my
explanations were confusing.</p>
<p>“I suppose he is dead,“ I said. “Some said that he was dead and some
said that he wasn’t.“</p>
<p>“Did you bury him without knowing whether he was dead or not?“ asked
the reporter.</p>
<p>“There was a mystery,“ said I. “We were twins, and one day when we
were two weeks old–that is, he was one week old, and I was one week
old–we got mixed up in the bath-tub, and one of us drowned. We never
could tell which. One of us had a strawberry birthmark on the back of
his hand. There it is on my hand. This is the one that was drowned.
There’s no doubt about it.</p>
<p>“Where’s the mystery?“ he said.</p>
<p>“Why, don’t you see how stupid it was to bury the wrong twin?“ I
answered. I didn’t explain it any more because he said the explanation
confused him. To me it is perfectly plain.</p>
<p>But, to get back to Fulton. I’m going along like an old man I used to
know who used to start to tell a story about his grandfather. He had an
awfully retentive memory, and he never finished the story, because he
switched off into something else. He used to tell about how his
grandfather one day went into a pasture, where there was a ram. The old
man dropped a silver dime in the grass, and stooped over to pick it up.
The ram was observing him, and took the old man’s action as an
invitation.</p>
<p>Just as he was going to finish about the ram this friend of mine
would recall that his grandfather had a niece who had a glass eye. She
used to loan that glass eye to another lady friend, who used it when she
received company. The eye didn’t fit the friend’s face, and it was
loose. And whenever she winked it would turn aver.</p>
<p>Then he got on the subject of accidents, and he would tell a story
about how he believed accidents never happened.</p>
<p>“There was an Irishman coming down a ladder with a hod of bricks,“ he
said, “and a Dutchman was standing on the ground below. The Irishman
fell on the Dutchman and killed him. Accident? Never! If the Dutchman
hadn’t been there the Irishman would have been killed. Why didn’t the
Irishman fall on a dog which was next, to the Dutchman? Because the dog
would have seen him coming.“</p>
<p>Then he’d get off from the Dutchman to an uncle named Reginald
Wilson. Reginald went into a carpet factory one day, and got twisted
into the machinery’s belt. He went excursioning around the factory until
he was properly distributed and was woven into sixty-nine yards of the
best three-ply carpet. His wife bought the carpet, and then she erected
a monument to his memory. It read:</p>
<p>Sacred to the memory of sixty-nine yards of the best three-ply carpet
containing the mortal remainders of</p>
<p>REGINALD WILSON</p>
<p>Go thou and do likewise</p>
<p>And so an he would ramble about telling the story of his grandfather
until we never were told whether he found the ten-cent piece or whether
something else happened.</p>
<p>FULTON DAY, JAMESTOWN</p>
<p>ADDRESS DELIVERED SEPTEMBER 23, 1907</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Governor Ellyson, of Virginia, in introducing Mr. Clemens,
said:</p>
<p>“The people have come here to bring a tribute of affectionate
recollection for the man who has contributed so much to the progress of
the world and the happiness of mankind.“ As Mr. Clemens came down to the
platform the applause became louder and louder, until Mr. Clemens held
out his hand for silence. It was a great triumph, and it was almost a
minute after the applause ceased before Mr. Clemens could speak. He
attempted it once, and when the audience noticed his emotion, it cheered
again loudly.</p>
<p>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,–I am but human, and when you, give me a
reception like that I am obliged to wait a little while I get my voice.
When you appeal to my head, I don’t feel it; but when you appeal to my
heart, I do feel it.</p>
<p>We are here to celebrate one of the greatest events of American
history, and not only in American history, but in the world’s
history.</p>
<p>Indeed it was–the application of steam by Robert Fulton.</p>
<p>It was a world event–there are not many of them. It is peculiarly an
American event, that is true, but the influence was very broad in
effect. We should regard this day as a very great American holiday. We
have not many that are exclusively American holidays. We have the Fourth
of July, which we regard as an American holiday, but it is nothing of
the kind. I am waiting for a dissenting voice. All great efforts that
led up to the Fourth of July were made, not by Americans, but by English
residents of America, subjects of the King of England.</p>
<p>They fought all the fighting that was done, they shed and spilt all
the blood that was spilt, in securing to us the invaluable liberties
which are incorporated in the Declaration of Independence; but they were
not Americans. They signed the Declaration of Independence; no
American’s name is signed to that document at all. There never was an
American such as you and I are until after the Revolution, when it had
all been fought out and liberty secured, after the adoption of the
Constitution, and the recognition of the Independence of America by all
powers.</p>
<p>While we revere the Fourth of July–and let us always revere it, and
the liberties it conferred upon us–yet it was not an American event, a
great American day.</p>
<p>It was an American who applied that steam successfully. There are not
a great many world events, and we have our full share. The telegraph,
telephone, and the application of steam to navigation–these are great
American events.</p>
<p>To-day I have been requested, or I have requested myself, not to
confine myself to furnishing you with information, but to remind you of
things, and to introduce one of the nation’s celebrants.</p>
<p>Admiral Harrington here is going to tell you all that I have left
untold. I am going to tell you all that I know, and then he will follow
up with such rags and remnants as he can find, and tell you what he
knows.</p>
<p>No doubt you have heard a great deal about Robert Fulton and the
influences that have grown from his invention, but the little steamboat
is suffering neglect.</p>
<p>You probably do not know a great deal about that boat. It was the
most important steamboat in the world. I was there and saw it. Admiral
Harrington was there at the time. It need not surprise you, for he is
not as old as he looks. That little boat was interesting in every way.
The size of it. The boat was one [consults Admiral], he said ten feet
long. The breadth of that boat [consults Admiral], two hundred feet. You
see, the first and most important detail is the length, then the
breadth, and then the depth; the depth of that boat was [consults again]
–the Admiral says it was a flat boat. Then her tonnage–you know nothing
about a boat until you know two more things: her speed and her tonnage.
We know the speed she made. She made four miles—and sometimes five
miles. It was on her initial trip, on, August 11, 1807, that she made
her initial trip, when she went from [consults Admiral] Jersey City–to
Chicago. That’s right. She went by way of Albany. Now comes the tonnage
of that boat. Tonnage of a boat means the amount of displacement;
displacement means the amount of water a vessel can shove in a day. The
tonnage of man is estimated by the amount of whiskey he can displace in
a day.</p>
<p>Robert Fulton named the ‘Clermont’ in honor of his bride, that is,
Clermont was the name of the county-seat.</p>
<p>I feel that it surprises you that I know so much. In my remarks of
welcome of Admiral Harrington I am not going to give him compliments.
Compliments always embarrass a man. You do not know anything to say. It
does not inspire you with words. There is nothing you can say in answer
to a compliment. I have been complimented myself a great many times, and
they always embarrass me–I always feel that they have not said
enough.</p>
<p>The Admiral and myself have held public office, and were associated
together a great deal a friendly way in the time of Pocahontas. That
incident where Pocahontas saves the life of Smith from her father,
Powhatan’s club, was gotten up by the Admiral and myself to advertise
Jamestown.</p>
<p>At that time the Admiral and myself did not have the facilities of
advertising that you have.</p>
<p>I have known Admiral Harrington in all kinds of situations–in public
service, on the platform, and in the chain-gang now and then–but it was
a mistake. A case of mistaken identity. I do not think it is at all a
necessity to tell you Admiral Harrington’s public history. You know that
it is in the histories. I am not here to tell you anything about his
public life, but to expose his private life.</p>
<p>I am something of a poet. When the great poet laureate, Tennyson,
died, and I found that the place was open, I tried to get it–but I did
not get it. Anybody can write the first line of a poem, but it is a very
difficult task to make the second line rhyme with the first. When I was
down in Australia there were two towns named Johnswood and Par-am. I
made this rhyme:</p>
<p>“The people of Johnswood are pious and good; The people of Par-am
they don’t care a—-.“</p>
<p>I do not want to compliment Admiral Harrington, but as long as such
men as he devote their lives to the public service the credit of the
country will never cease. I will say that the same high qualities, the
same moral and intellectual attainments, the same graciousness of
manner, of conduct, of observation, and expression have caused Admiral
Harrington to be mistaken for me–and I have been mistaken for him.</p>
<p>A mutual compliment can go no further, and I now have the honor and
privilege of introducing to you Admiral Harrington.</p>
<p>LOTOS CLUB DINNER IN HONOR OF MARK TWAIN</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE FIRST FORMAL DINNER IN THE NEW CLUB-HOUSE, NOVEMBER
11, 1893</p>
<p>In introducing the guest of the evening, Mr. Lawrence said:</p>
<p>“To-night the old faces appear once more amid new surroundings. The
place where last we met about the table has vanished, and to-night we
have our first Lotos dinner in a home that is all our own. It is
peculiarly fitting that the board should now be spread in honor of one
who has been a member of the club for full a score of years, and it is a
happy augury for the future that our fellow-member whom we assemble to
greet should be the bearer of a most distinguished name in the world of
letters; for the Lotos Club is ever at its best when paying homage to
genius in literature or in art. Is there a civilized being who has not
heard the name of Mark Twain? We knew him long years ago, before he came
out of the boundless West, brimful of wit and eloquence, with no
reverence for anything, and went abroad to educate the untutored
European in the subtleties of the American joke. The world has looked on
and applauded while he has broken many images. He has led us in
imagination all over the globe. With him as our guide we have traversed
alike the Mississippi and the Sea of Galilee. At his bidding we have
laughed at a thousand absurdities. By a laborious process of reasoning
he has convinced us that the Egyptian mummies are actually dead. He has
held us spellbound upon the plain at the foot of the great Sphinx, and
we have joined him in weeping bitter tears at the tomb of Adam. To-night
we greet him in the flesh. What name is there in literature that can be
likened to his? Perhaps some of the distinguished gentlemen about this
table can tell us, but I know of none. Himself his only parallel!“</p>
<p>MR. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN, AND MY FELLOW-MEMBERS OF THE LOTOS CLUB,–I
have seldom in my lifetime listened to compliments so felicitously
phrased or so well deserved. I return thanks for them from a full heart
and an appreciative spirit, and I will say this in self-defence: While I
am charged with having no reverence for anything, I wish to say that I
have reverence for the man who can utter such truths, and I also have a
deep reverence and a sincere one for a club that can do such justice to
me. To be the chief guest of such a club is something to be envied, and
if I read your countenances rightly I am envied. I am glad to see this
club in such palatial quarters. I remember it twenty years ago when it
was housed in a stable.</p>
<p>Now when I was studying for the ministry there were two or three
things that struck my attention particularly. At the first banquet
mentioned in history that other prodigal son who came back from his
travels was invited to stand up and have his say. They were all there,
his brethren, David and Goliath, and–er, and if he had had such
experience as I have had he would have waited until those other people
got through talking. He got up and testified to all his failings. Now if
he had waited before telling all about his riotous living until the
others had spoken he might not have given himself away as he did, and I
think that I would give myself away if I should go on. I think I’d
better wait until the others hand in their testimony; then if it is
necessary for me to make an explanation, I will get up and explain, and
if I cannot do that, I’ll deny it happened.</p>
<p>Later in the evening Mr. Clemens made another speech, replying to a
fire of short speeches by Charles Dudley Warner, Charles A. Dana, Seth
Low, General Porter, and many others, each welcoming the guest of
honor.</p>
<p>I don’t see that I have a great deal to explain. I got off very well,
considering the opportunities that these other fellows had. I don’t see
that Mr. Low said anything against me, and neither did Mr. Dana.
However, I will say that I never heard so many lies told in one evening
as were told by Mr. McKelway–and I consider myself very capable; but
even in his case, when he got through, I was gratified by finding how
much he hadn’t found out. By accident he missed the very things that I
didn’t want to have said, and now, gentlemen, about Americanism.</p>
<p>I have been on the continent of Europe for two and a half years. I
have met many Americans there, some sojourning for a short time only,
others making protracted stays, and it has been very gratifying to me to
find that nearly all preserved their Americanism. I have found they all
like to see the Flag fly, and that their hearts rise when they see the
Stars and Stripes. I met only one lady who had forgotten the land of her
birth and glorified monarchical institutions.</p>
<p>I think it is a great thing to say that in two and a half years I met
only one person who had fallen a victim to the shams–I think we may call
them shams–of nobilities and of heredities. She was entirely lost in
them. After I had listened to her for a long time, I said to her: “At
least you must admit that we have one merit. We are not like the
Chinese, who refuse to allow their citizens who are tired of the country
to leave it. Thank God, we don’t!“</p>
<p>COPYRIGHT</p>
<p>With Mr. Howells, Edward Everett Hale, Thomas Nelson Page, and a
number of other authors, Mr. Clemens appeared before the committee
December 6, 1906. The new Copyright Bill contemplated an author’s
copyright for the term of his life and for fifty years thereafter,
applying also for the benefit of artists, musicians, and others, but the
authors did most of the talking. F. D. Millet made a speech for the
artists, and John Philip Sousa for the musicians.</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens was the last speaker of the day, and its chief feature.
He made a speech, the serious parts of which created a strong
impression, and the humorous parts set the Senators and Representatives
in roars of laughter.</p>
<p>I have read this bill. At least I have read such portions as I could
understand. Nobody but a practised legislator can read the bill and
thoroughly understand it, and I am not a practised legislator.</p>
<p>I am interested particularly and especially in the part of the bill
which concerns my trade. I like that extension of copyright life to the
author’s life and fifty years afterward. I think that would satisfy any
reasonable author, because it would take care of his children. Let the
grandchildren take care of themselves. That would take care of my
daughters, and after that I am not particular. I shall then have long
been out of this struggle, independent of it, indifferent to it.</p>
<p>It isn’t objectionable to me that all the trades and professions in
the United States are protected by the bill. I like that. They are all
important and worthy, and if we can take care of them under the
Copyright law I should like to see it done. I should like to see oyster
culture added, and anything else.</p>
<p>I am aware that copyright must have a limit, because that is required
by the Constitution of the United States, which sets aside the earlier
Constitution, which we call the decalogue. The decalogue says you shall
not take away from any man his profit. I don’t like to be obliged to use
the harsh term. What the decalogue really says is, “Thou shaft not
steal,“ but I am trying to use more polite language.</p>
<p>The laws of England and America do take it away, do select but one
class, the people who create the literature of the land. They always
talk handsomely about the literature of the land, always what a fine,
great, monumental thing a great literature is, and in the midst of their
enthusiasm they turn around and do what they can to discourage it.</p>
<p>I know we must have a limit, but forty-two years is too much of a
limit. I am quite unable to guess why there should be a limit at all to
the possession of the product of a man’s labor. There is no limit to
real estate.</p>
<p>Doctor Bale has suggested that a man might just as well, after
discovering a coal-mine and working it forty-two years, have the
Government step in and take it away.</p>
<p>What is the excuse? It is that the author who produced that book has
had the profit of it long enough, and therefore the Government takes a
profit which does not belong to it and generously gives it to the
88,000,000 of people. But it doesn’t do anything of the kind. It merely
takes the author’s property, takes his children’s bread, and gives the
publisher double profit. He goes on publishing the book and as many of
his confederates as choose to go into the conspiracy do so, and they
rear families in affluence.</p>
<p>And they continue the enjoyment of those ill-gotten gains generation
after generation forever, for they never die. In a few weeks or months
or years I shall be out of it, I hope under a monument. I hope I shall
not be entirely forgotten, and I shall subscribe to the monument myself.
But I shall not be caring what happens if there are fifty years left of
my copyright. My copyright produces annually a good deal more than I can
use, but my children can use it. I can get along; I know a lot of
trades. But that goes to my daughters, who can’t get along as well as I
can because I have carefully raised them as young ladies, who don’t know
anything and can’t do anything. I hope Congress will extend to them the
charity which they have failed to get from me.</p>
<p>Why, if a man who is not even mad, but only strenuous–strenuous about
race-suicide–should come to me and try to get me to use my large
political and ecclesiastical influence to get a bill passed by this
Congress limiting families to twenty-two children by one mother, I
should try to calm him down. I should reason with him. I should say to
him, “Leave it alone. Leave it alone and it will take care of itself.
Only one couple a year in the United States can reach that limit. If
they have reached that limit let them go right on. Let them have all the
liberty they want. In restricting that family to twenty-two children you
are merely conferring discomfort and unhappiness on one family per year
in a nation of 88,000,000, which is not worth while.“</p>
<p>It is the very same with copyright. One author per year produces a
book which can outlive the forty-two-year limit; that’s all. This nation
can’t produce two authors a year that can do it; the thing is
demonstrably impossible. All that the limited copyright can do is to
take the bread out of the mouths of the children of that one author per
year.</p>
<p>I made an estimate some years ago, when I appeared before a committee
of the House of Lords, that we had published in this country since the
Declaration of Independence 220,000 books. They have all gone. They had
all perished before they were ten years old. It is only one book in 1000
that can outlive the forty-two year limit. Therefore why put a limit at
all? You might as well limit the family to twenty-two children.</p>
<p>If you recall the Americans in the nineteenth century who wrote books
that lived forty-two years you will have to begin with Cooper; you can
follow with Washington Irving, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Edgar Allan Poe,
and there you have to wait a long time. You come to Emerson, and you
have to stand still and look further. You find Howells and T. B.
Aldrich, and then your numbers begin to run pretty thin, and you
question if you can name twenty persons in the United States who–in a
whole century have written books that would live forty-two years. Why,
you could take them all and put them on one bench there [pointing]. Add
the wives and children and you could put the result on, two or three
more benches.</p>
<p>One hundred persons–that is the little, insignificant crowd whose
bread-and-butter is to be taken away for what purpose, for what profit
to anybody? You turn these few books into the hands of the pirate and of
the legitimate publisher, too, and they get the profit that should have
gone to the wife and children.</p>
<p>When I appeared before that committee of the House of Lords the
chairman asked me what limit I would propose. I said, “Perpetuity.“ I
could see some resentment in his manner, and he said the idea was
illogical, for the reason that it has long ago been decided that there
can be no such thing as property in ideas. I said there was property in
ideas before Queen Anne’s time; they had perpetual copyright. He said,
“What is a book? A book is just built from base to roof on ideas, and
there can be no property in it.“</p>
<p>I said I wished he could mention any kind of property on this planet
that had a pecuniary value which was not derived from an idea or
ideas.</p>
<p>He said real estate. I put a supposititious case, a dozen Englishmen
who travel through South Africa and camp out, and eleven of them see
nothing at all; they are mentally blind. But there is one in the party
who knows what this harbor means and what the lay of the land means. To
him it means that some day a railway will go through here, and there on
that harbor a great city will spring up. That is his idea. And he has
another idea, which is to go and trade his last bottle of Scotch whiskey
and his last horse-blanket to the principal chief of that region and buy
a piece of land the size of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>That was the value of an idea that the day would come when the Cape
to Cairo Railway would be built.</p>
<p>Every improvement that is put upon the real estate is the result of
an idea in somebody’s head. The skyscraper is another idea; the railroad
is another; the telephone and all those things are merely symbols which
represent ideas. An andiron, a wash-tub, is the result of an idea that
did not exist before.</p>
<p>So if, as that gentleman said, a book does consist solely of ideas,
that is the best argument in the world that it is property, and should
not be under any limitation at all. We don’t ask for that. Fifty years
from now we shall ask for it.</p>
<p>I hope the bill will pass without any deleterious amendments. I do
seem to be extraordinarily interested in a whole lot of arts and things
that I have got nothing to do with. It is a part of my generous, liberal
nature; I can’t help it. I feel the same sort of charity to everybody
that was manifested by a gentleman who arrived at home at two o’clock in
the morning from the club and was feeling so perfectly satisfied with
life, so happy, and so comfortable, and there was his house weaving,
weaving, weaving around. He watched his chance, and by and by when the
steps got in his neighborhood he made a jump and climbed up and got on
the portico.</p>
<p>And the house went on weaving and weaving and weaving, but he watched
the door, and when it came around his way he plunged through it. He got
to the stairs, and when he went up on all fours the house was so
unsteady that he could hardly make his way, but at last he got to the
top and raised his foot and put it on the top step. But only the toe
hitched on the step, and he rolled down and fetched up on the bottom
step, with his arm around the newel-post, and he said:</p>
<p>“God pity the poor sailors out at sea on a night like this.“</p>
<p>IN AID OF THE BLIND</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE NEW YORK ASSOCIATION FOR PROMOTING
THE INTERESTS OF THE BLIND AT THE WALDORF ASTORIA, MARCH 29, 1906</p>
<p>If you detect any awkwardness in my movements and infelicities in my
conduct I will offer the explanation that I never presided at a meeting
of any kind before in my life, and that I do find it out of my line. I
supposed I could do anything anybody else could, but I recognize that
experience helps, and I do feel the lack of that experience. I don’t
feel as graceful and easy as I ought to be in order to impress an
audience. I shall not pretend that I know how to umpire a meeting like
this, and I shall just take the humble place of the Essex band.</p>
<p>There was a great gathering in a small New England town, about
twenty-five years ago. I remember that circumstance because there was
something that happened at that time. It was a great occasion. They
gathered in the militia and orators and everybody from all the towns
around. It was an extraordinary occasion.</p>
<p>The little local paper threw itself into ecstasies of admiration and
tried to do itself proud from beginning to end. It praised the orators,
the militia, and all the bands that came from everywhere, and all this
in honest country newspaper detail, but the writer ran out of adjectives
toward the end. Having exhausted his whole magazine of praise and
glorification, he found he still had one band left over. He had to say
something about it, and he said: “The Essex band done the best it
could.“</p>
<p>I am an Essex band on this occasion, and I am going to get through as
well as inexperience and good intentions will enable me. I have got all
the documents here necessary to instruct you in the objects and
intentions of this meeting and also of the association which has called
the meeting. But they are too voluminous. I could not pack those
statistics into my head, and I had to give it up. I shall have to just
reduce all that mass of statistics to a few salient facts. There are too
many statistics and figures for me. I never could do anything with
figures, never had any talent for mathematics, never accomplished
anything in my efforts at that rugged study, and to-day the only
mathematics I know is multiplication, and the minute I get away up in
that, as soon as I reach nine times seven–</p>
<p>[Mr. Clemens lapsed into deep thought for a moment. He was trying to
figure out nine times seven, but it was a hopeless task, and he turned
to St. Clair McKelway, who sat near him. Mr. McKelway whispered the
answer, and the speaker resumed:]</p>
<p>I’ve got it now. It’s eighty-four. Well, I can get that far all right
with a little hesitation. After that I am uncertain, and I can’t manage
a statistic.</p>
<p>“This association for the–“</p>
<p>[Mr. Clemens was in another dilemma. Again he was obliged to turn to
Mr. McKelway.]</p>
<p>Oh yes, for promoting the interests of the blind. It’s a long name.
If I could I would write it out for you and let you take it home and
study it, but I don’t know how to spell it. And Mr. Carnegie is down in
Virginia somewhere. Well, anyway, the object of that association which
has been recently organized, five months ago, in fact, is in the hands
of very, very energetic, intelligent, and capable people, and they will
push it to success very surely, and all the more surely if you will give
them a little of your assistance out of your pockets.</p>
<p>The intention, the purpose, is to search out all the blind and find
work for them to do so that they may earn, their own bread. Now it is
dismal enough to be blind–it is dreary, dreary life at best, but it can
be largely ameliorated by finding something for these poor blind people
to do with their hands. The time passes so heavily that it is never day
or night with them, it is always night, and when they have to sit with
folded hands and with nothing to do to amuse or entertain or employ
their minds, it is drearier and drearier.</p>
<p>And then the knowledge they have that they must subsist on charity,
and so often reluctant charity, it would renew their lives if they could
have something to do with their hands and pass their time and at the
same time earn their bread, and know the sweetness of the bread which is
the result of the labor of one’s own hands. They need that cheer and
pleasure. It is the only way you can turn their night into day, to give
them happy hearts, the only thing you can put in the place of the
blessed sun. That you can do in the way I speak of.</p>
<p>Blind people generally who have seen the light know what it is to
miss the light. Those who have gone blind since they were twenty years
old –their lives are unendingly dreary. But they can be taught to use
their hands and to employ themselves at a great many industries. That
association from which this draws its birth in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
has taught its blind to make many things. They make them better than
most people, and more honest than people who have the use of their eyes.
The goods they make are readily salable. People like them. And so they
are supporting themselves, and it is a matter of cheer, cheer. They pass
their time now not too irksomely as they formerly did.</p>
<p>What this association needs and wants is 5,000. The figures are set
down, and what the money is for, and there is no graft in it or I would
not be here. And they hope to beguile that out of your pockets, and you
will find affixed to the programme an opportunity, that little blank
which you will fill out and promise so much money now or to-morrow or
some time. Then, there is another opportunity which is still better, and
that is that you shall subscribe an annual sum.</p>
<p>I have invented a good many useful things in my time, but never
anything better than that of getting money out of people who don’t want
to part with it. It is always for good objects, of course. This is the
plan: When you call upon a person to contribute to a great and good
object, and you think he should furnish about ,000, he disappoints you
as like as not. Much the best way to work him to supply that thousand
dollars is to split it into parts and contribute, say a hundred dollars
a year, or fifty, or whatever the sum maybe. Let him contribute ten or
twenty a year. He doesn’t feel that, but he does feel it when you call
upon him to contribute a large amount. When you get used to it you would
rather contribute than borrow money.</p>
<p>I tried it in Helen Keller’s case. Mr. Hutton wrote me in 1896 or
1897 when I was in London and said: “The gentleman who has been so
liberal in taking care of Helen Keller has died without making provision
for her in his will, and now they don’t know what to do.“ They were
proposing to raise a fund, and he thought 0,000 enough to furnish an
income of 400 or 500 a year for the support of that wonderful girl and
her wonderful teacher, Miss Sullivan, now Mrs. Macy. I wrote to
Mr. Hutton and said: “Go on, get up your fund. It will be slow, but if
you want quick work, I propose this system,“ the system I speak of, of
asking people to contribute such and such a sum from year to year and
drop out whenever they please, and he would find there wouldn’t be any
difficulty, people wouldn’t feel the burden of it. And he wrote back
saying he had raised the 400 a year indefinitely by that system in, a
single afternoon. We would like to do something just like that to-night.
We will take as many checks as you care to give. You can leave your
donations in the big room outside.</p>
<p>I knew once what it was to be blind. I shall never forget that
experience. I have been as blind as anybody ever was for three or four
hours, and the sufferings that I endured and the mishaps and the
accidents that are burning in my memory make my sympathy rise when I
feel for the blind and always shall feel. I once went to Heidelberg on
an excursion. I took a clergyman along with me, the Rev. Joseph
Twichell, of Hartford, who is still among the living despite that fact.
I always travel with clergymen when I can. It is better for them, it is
better for me. And any preacher who goes out with me in stormy weather
and without a lightning rod is a good one. The Reverend Twichell is one
of those people filled with patience and endurance, two good ingredients
for a man travelling with me, so we got along very well together. In
that old town they have not altered a house nor built one in 1500 years.
We went to the inn and they placed Twichell and me in a most colossal
bedroom, the largest I ever saw or heard of. It was as big as this
room.</p>
<p>I didn’t take much notice of the place. I didn’t really get my
bearings. I noticed Twichell got a German bed about two feet wide, the
kind in which you’ve got to lie on your edge, because there isn’t room
to lie on your back, and he was way down south in that big room, and I
was way up north at the other end of it, with a regular Sahara in
between.</p>
<p>We went to bed. Twichell went to sleep, but then he had his
conscience loaded and it was easy for him to get to sleep. I couldn’t
get to sleep. It was one of those torturing kinds of lovely summer
nights when you hear various kinds of noises now and then. A mouse away
off in the southwest. You throw things at the mouse. That encourages the
mouse. But I couldn’t stand it, and about two o’clock I got up and
thought I would give it up and go out in the square where there was one
of those tinkling fountains, and sit on its brink and dream, full of
romance.</p>
<p>I got out of bed, and I ought to have lit a candle, but I didn’t
think of it until it was too late. It was the darkest place that ever
was. There has never been darkness any thicker than that. It just lay in
cakes.</p>
<p>I thought that before dressing I would accumulate my clothes. I pawed
around in the dark and found everything packed together on the floor
except one sock. I couldn’t get on the track of that sock. It might have
occurred to me that maybe it was in the wash. But I didn’t think of
that. I went excursioning on my hands and knees. Presently I thought, “I
am never going to find it; I’ll go back to bed again.“ That is what I
tried to do during the next three hours. I had lost the bearings of that
bed. I was going in the wrong direction all the time. By-and-by I came
in collision with a chair and that encouraged me.</p>
<p>It seemed to me, as far as I could recollect, there was only a chair
here and there and yonder, five or six of them scattered over this
territory, and I thought maybe after I found that chair I might find the
next one. Well, I did. And I found another and another and another. I
kept going around on my hands and knees, having those sudden collisions,
and finally when I banged into another chair I almost lost my temper.
And I raised up, garbed as I was, not for public exhibition, right in
front of a mirror fifteen or sixteen feet high.</p>
<p>I hadn’t noticed the mirror; didn’t know it was there. And when I saw
myself in the mirror I was frightened out of my wits. I don’t allow any
ghosts to bite me, and I took up a chair and smashed at it. A million
pieces. Then I reflected. That’s the way I always do, and it’s
unprofitable unless a man has had much experience that way and has clear
judgment. And I had judgment, and I would have had to pay for that
mirror if I hadn’t recollected to say it was Twichell who broke it.</p>
<p>Then I got down, on my hands and knees and went on another exploring
expedition.</p>
<p>As far as I could remember there were six chairs in that Oklahoma,
and one table, a great big heavy table, not a good table to hit with
your head when rushing madly along. In the course of time I collided
with thirty-five chairs and tables enough to stock that dining-room out
there. It was a hospital for decayed furniture, and it was in a worse
condition when I got through with it. I went on and on, and at last got
to a place where I could feel my way up, and there was a shelf. I knew
that wasn’t in the middle of the room. Up to that time I was afraid I
had gotten out of the city.</p>
<p>I was very careful and pawed along that shelf, and there was a
pitcher of water about a foot high, and it was at the head of Twichell’s
bed, but I didn’t know it. I felt that pitcher going and I grabbed at
it, but it didn’t help any and came right down in Twichell’s face and
nearly drowned him. But it woke him up. I was grateful to have company
on any terms. He lit a match, and there I was, way down south when I
ought to have been back up yonder. My bed was out of sight it was so far
away. You needed a telescope to find it. Twichell comforted me and I
scrubbed him off and we got sociable.</p>
<p>But that night wasn’t wasted. I had my pedometer on my leg. Twichell
and I were in a pedometer match. Twichell had longer legs than I. The
only way I could keep up was to wear my pedometer to bed. I always walk
in my sleep, and on this occasion I gained sixteen miles on him. After
all, I never found that sock. I never have seen it from that day to
this. But that adventure taught me what it is to be blind. That was one
of the most serious occasions of my whole life, yet I never can speak of
it without somebody thinking it isn’t serious. You try it and see how
serious it is to be as the blind are and I was that night.</p>
<p>[Mr. Clemens read several letters of regret. He then introduced
Joseph H. Choate, saying:]</p>
<p>It is now my privilege to present to you Mr. Choate. I don’t have to
really introduce him. I don’t have to praise him, or to flatter him. I
could say truly that in the forty-seven years I have been familiarly
acquainted with him he has always been the handsomest man America has
ever produced. And I hope and believe he will hold the belt forty-five
years more. He has served his country ably, faithfully, and brilliantly.
He stands at the summit, at the very top in the esteem and regard of his
countrymen, and if I could say one word which would lift him any higher
in his countrymen’s esteem and affection, I would say that word whether
it was true or not.</p>
<p>DR. MARK TWAIN, FARMEOPATH</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE ANNUAL DINNER OF THE NEW YORK POST-GRADUATE MEDICAL
SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL, JANUARY 21, 1909</p>
<p>The president, Dr. George N. Miller, in introducing Mr. Clemens,
referred to his late experience with burglars.</p>
<p>GENTLEMEN AND DOCTORS,–I am glad to be among my own kind to-night. I
was once a sharpshooter, but now I practise a much higher and equally as
deadly a profession. It wasn’t so very long ago that I became a member
of your cult, and for the time I’ve been in the business my record is
one that can’t be scoffed at.</p>
<p>As to the burglars, I am perfectly familiar with these people. I have
always had a good deal to do with burglars–not officially, but through
their attentions to me. I never suffered anything at the hands of a
burglar. They have invaded my house time and time again. They never got
anything. Then those people who burglarized our house in September–we
got back the plated ware they took off, we jailed them, and I have been
sorry ever since. They did us a great service they scared off all the
servants in the place.</p>
<p>I consider the Children’s Theatre, of which I am president, and the
Post-Graduate Medical School as the two greatest institutions in the
country. This school, in bringing its twenty thousand physicians from
all parts of the country, bringing them up to date, and sending them
back with renewed confidence, has surely saved hundreds of thousands of
lives which otherwise would have been lost.</p>
<p>I have been practising now for seven months. When I settled on my
farm in Connecticut in June I found the Community very thinly
settled–and since I have been engaged in practice it has become more
thinly settled still. This gratifies me, as indicating that I am making
an impression on my community. I suppose it is the same with all of
you.</p>
<p>I have always felt that I ought to do something for you, and so I
organized a Redding (Connecticut) branch of the Post-Graduate School. I
am only a country farmer up there, but I am doing the best I can.</p>
<p>Of course, the practice of medicine and surgery in a remote country
district has its disadvantages, but in my case I am happy in a division
of responsibility. I practise in conjunction with a horse-doctor, a
sexton, and an undertaker. The combination is air-tight, and once a man
is stricken in our district escape is impossible for him.</p>
<p>These four of us–three in the regular profession and the fourth an
undertaker–are all good men. There is Bill Ferguson, the Redding
undertaker. Bill is there in every respect. He is a little lukewarm on
general practice, and writes his name with a rubber stamp. Like my old
Southern, friend, he is one of the finest planters anywhere.</p>
<p>Then there is Jim Ruggles, the horse-doctor. Ruggles is one of the
best men I have got. He also is not much on general medicine, but he is
a fine horse-doctor. Ferguson doesn’t make any money off him.</p>
<p>You see, the combination started this way. When I got up to Redding
and had become a doctor, I looked around to see what my chances were for
aiding in, the great work. The first thing I did was to determine what
manner of doctor I was to be. Being a Connecticut farmer, I naturally
consulted my farmacopia, and at once decided to become a farmeopath.</p>
<p>Then I got circulating about, and got in touch with Ferguson and
Ruggles. Ferguson joined readily in my ideas, but Ruggles kept saying
that, while it was all right for an undertaker to get aboard, he
couldn’t see where it helped horses.</p>
<p>Well, we started to find out what was the trouble with the community,
and it didn’t take long to find out that there was just one disease, and
that was race-suicide. And driving about the country-side I was told by
my fellow-farmers that it was the only rational human and valuable
disease. But it is cutting into our profits so that we’ll either have to
stop it or we’ll have to move.</p>
<p>We’ve had some funny experiences up there in Redding. Not long ago a
fellow came along with a rolling gait and a distressed face. We asked
him what was the matter. We always hold consultations on every case, as
there isn’t business enough for four. He said he didn’t know, but that
he was a sailor, and perhaps that might help us to give a diagnosis. We
treated him for that, and I never saw a man die more peacefully.</p>
<p>That same afternoon my dog Tige treed an African gentleman. We
chained up the dog, and then the gentleman came down and said he had
appendicitis. We asked him if he wanted to be cut open, and he said yes,
that he’d like to know if there was anything in it. So we cut him open
and found nothing in him but darkness. So we diagnosed his case as
infidelity, because he was dark inside. Tige is a very clever dog, and
aids us greatly.</p>
<p>The other day a patient came to me and inquired if I was old Doctor
Clemens–</p>
<p>As a practitioner I have given a great deal of my attention to
Bright’s disease. I have made some rules for treating it that may be
valuable. Listen:</p>
<p>Rule 1. When approaching the bedside of one whom an all-wise
President –I mean an all-wise Providence–well, anyway, it’s the same
thing–has seen fit to afflict with disease–well, the rule is simple,
even if it is old-fashioned.</p>
<p>Rule 2. I’ve forgotten just what it is, but–</p>
<p>Rule 3. This is always indispensable: Bleed your patient.</p>
<p>MISSOURI UNIVERSITY SPEECH</p>
<p>ADDRESS DELIVERED JUNE 4, 1902, AT COLUMBIA, MO.</p>
<p>When the name of Samuel L. Clemens was called the humorist stepped
forward, put his hand to his hair, and apparently hesitated. There was a
dead silence for a moment. Suddenly the entire audience rose and stood
in silence. Some one began to spell out the word Missouri with an
interval between the letters. All joined in. Then the house again became
silent. Mr. Clemens broke the spell:</p>
<p>As you are all standing [he drawled in his characteristic voice], I
guess, I suppose I had better stand too.</p>
<p>[Then came a laugh and loud cries for a speech. As the great humorist
spoke of his recent visit to Hannibal, his old home, his voice
trembled.]</p>
<p>You cannot know what a strain it was on my emotions [he said]. In
fact, when I found myself shaking hands with persons I had not seen for
fifty years and looking into wrinkled faces that were so young and
joyous when I last saw them, I experienced emotions that I had never
expected, and did not know were in me. I was profoundly moved anal
saddened to think that this was the last time, perhaps, that I would
ever behold those kind old faces and dear old scenes of childhood.</p>
<p>[The humorist then changed to a lighter mood, and for a time the
audience was in a continual roar of laughter. He was particularly amused
at the eulogy on himself read by Gardiner Lathrop in conferring the
degree.] He has a fine opportunity to distinguish himself [said
Mr. Clemens] by telling the truth about me.</p>
<p>I have seen it stated in print that as a boy I had been guilty of
stealing peaches, apples, and watermelons. I read a story to this effect
very closely not long ago, and I was convinced of one thing, which was
that the man who wrote it was of the opinion that it was wrong to steal,
and that I had not acted right in doing so. I wish now, however, to make
an honest statement, which is that I do not believe, in all my checkered
career, I stole a ton of peaches.</p>
<p>One night I stole–I mean I removed–a watermelon from a wagon while
the owner was attending to another customer. I crawled off to a secluded
spot, where I found that it was green. It was the greenest melon in the
Mississippi Valley. Then I began to reflect. I began to be sorry. I
wondered what George Washington would have done had he been in my place.
I thought a long time, and then suddenly felt that strange feeling which
comes to a man with a good resolution, and I took up that watermelon and
took it back to its owner. I handed him the watermelon and told him to
reform. He took my lecture much to heart, and, when he gave me a good
one in place of the green melon, I forgave him.</p>
<p>I told him that I would still be a customer of his, and that I
cherished no ill-feeling because of the incident–that would remain green
in my memory.</p>
<p>BUSINESS</p>
<p>The alumni of Eastman College gave their annual banquet, March 30,
1901, at the Y. M. C. A. Building. Mr. James G. Cannon, of the Fourth
National Bank, made the first speech of the evening, after which
Mr. Clemens was introduced by Mr. Bailey as the personal friend of Tom
Sawyer, who was one of the types of successful business men.</p>
<p>MR. CANNON has furnished me with texts enough to last as slow a
speaker as myself all the rest of the night. I took exception to the
introducing of Mr. Cannon as a great financier, as if he were the only
great financier present. I am a financier. But my methods are not the
same as Mr. Cannon’s.</p>
<p>I cannot say that I have turned out the great business man that I
thought I was when I began life. But I am comparatively young yet, and
may learn. I am rather inclined to believe that what troubled me was
that I got the big-head early in the game. I want to explain to you a
few points of difference between the principles of business as I see
them and those that Mr. Cannon believes in.</p>
<p>He says that the primary rule of business success is loyalty to your
employer. That’s all right–as a theory. What is the matter with loyalty
to yourself? As nearly as I can understand Mr. Cannon’s methods, there
is one great drawback to them. He wants you to work a great deal.
Diligence is a good thing, but taking things easy is much more-restful.
My idea is that the employer should be the busy man, and the employee
the idle one. The employer should be the worried man, and the employee
the happy one. And why not? He gets the salary. My plan is to get
another man to do the work for me. In that there’s more repose. What I
want is repose first, last, and all the time.</p>
<p>Mr. Cannon says that there are three cardinal rules of business
success; they are diligence, honesty, and truthfulness. Well, diligence
is all right. Let it go as a theory. Honesty is the best policy–when
there is money in it. But truthfulness is one of the most dangerous–why,
this man is misleading you.</p>
<p>I had an experience to-day with my wife which illustrates this. I was
acknowledging a belated invitation to another dinner for this evening,
which seemed to have been sent about ten days ago. It only reached me
this morning. I was mortified at the discourtesy into which I had been
brought by this delay, and wondered what was being thought of me by my
hosts. As I had accepted your invitation, of course I had to send
regrets to my other friends.</p>
<p>When I started to write this note my wife came up and stood looking
over my shoulder. Women always want to know what is going on. Said she
“Should not that read in the third person?“ I conceded that it should,
put aside what I was writing, and commenced over again. That seemed to
satisfy her, and so she sat down and let me proceed. I then–finished my
first note–and so sent what I intended. I never could have done this if
I had let my wife know the truth about it. Here is what I wrote:</p>
<p>TO THE OHIO SOCIETY,–I have at this moment received a most kind
invitation (eleven days old) from Mr. Southard, president; and a like
one (ten days old) from Mr. Bryant, president of the Press Club. I thank
the society cordially for the compliment of these invitations, although
I am booked elsewhere and cannot come.</p>
<p>But, oh, I should like to know the name of the Lightning Express by
which they were forwarded; for I owe a friend a dozen chickens, and I
believe it will be cheaper to send eggs instead, and let them develop on
the road. Sincerely yours, Mark TWAIN.</p>
<p>I want to tell you of some of my experiences in business, and then I
will be in a position to lay down one general rule for the guidance of
those who want to succeed in business. My first effort was about
twenty-five years ago. I took hold of an invention–I don’t know now what
it was all about, but some one came to me tend told me it was a good
thing, and that there was lots of money in it. He persuaded me to invest
5,000, and I lived up to my beliefs by engaging a man to develop it. To
make a long story short, I sunk 0,000 in it.</p>
<p>Then I took up the publication of a book. I called in a publisher and
said to him: “I want you to publish this book along lines which I shall
lay down. I am the employer, and you are the employee. I am going to
show them some new kinks in the publishing business. And I want you to
draw on me for money as you go along,“ which he did. He drew on me for
6,000. Then I asked him to take the book and call it off. But he refused
to do that.</p>
<p>My next venture was with a machine for doing something or other. I
knew less about that than I did about the invention. But I sunk 70,000
in the business, and I can’t for the life of me recollect what it was
the machine was to do.</p>
<p>I was still undismayed. You see, one of the strong points about my
business life was that I never gave up. I undertook to publish General
Grant’s book, and made 40,000 in six months. My axiom is, to succeed in
business: avoid my example.</p>
<p>CARNEGIE THE BENEFACTOR</p>
<p>At the dinner given in honor of Andrew Carnegie by the Lotos Club,
March 17, 1909, Mr. Clemens appeared in a white suit from head to feet.
He wore a white double-breasted coat, white trousers, and white shoes.
The only relief was a big black cigar, which he confidentially informed
the company was not from his usual stack bought at per barrel.</p>
<p>The State of Missouri has for its coat of arms a barrel-head with two
Missourians, one on each side of it, and mark the motto–“United We
Stand, Divided We Fall.“ Mr. Carnegie, this evening, has suffered from
compliments. It is interesting to hear what people will say about a man.
Why, at the banquet given by this club in my honor, Mr. Carnegie had the
inspiration for which the club is now honoring him. If Dunfermline
contributed so much to the United States in contributing Mr. Carnegie,
what would have happened if all Scotland had turned out? These
Dunfermline folk have acquired advantages in coming to America.</p>
<p>Doctor McKelway paid the top compliment, the cumulation, when he said
of Mr. Carnegie:</p>
<p>“There is a man who wants to pay more taxes than he is charged.“
Richard Watson Gilder did very well for a poet. He advertised his
magazine. He spoke of hiring Mr. Carnegie–the next thing he will be
trying to hire me.</p>
<p>If I undertook–to pay compliments I would do it stronger than any
others have done it, for what Mr. Carnegie wants are strong compliments.
Now, the other side of seventy, I have preserved, as my chiefest virtue,
modesty.</p>
<p>ON POETRY, VERACITY, AND SUICIDE</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT A DINNER OF THE MANHATTAN DICKENS FELLOWSHIP, NEW YORK
CITY, FEBRUARY 7, 1906</p>
<p>This dinner was in commemoration of the ninety-fourth anniversary of
the birth of Charles Dickens. On an other occasion Mr. Clemens told the
same story with variations and a different conclusion to the University
Settlement Society.</p>
<p>I always had taken an interest in young people who wanted to become
poets. I remember I was particularly interested in one budding poet when
I was a reporter. His name was Butter.</p>
<p>One day he came to me and said, disconsolately, that he was going to
commit suicide–he was tired of life, not being able to express his
thoughts in poetic form. Butter asked me what I thought of the idea.</p>
<p>I said I would; that it was a good idea. “You can do me a friendly
turn. You go off in a private place and do it there, and I’ll get it
all. You do it, and I’ll do as much for you some time.“</p>
<p>At first he determined to drown himself. Drowning is so nice and
clean, and writes up so well in a newspaper.</p>
<p>But things ne’er do go smoothly in weddings, suicides, or courtships.
Only there at the edge of the water, where Butter was to end himself,
lay a life-preserver–a big round canvas one, which would float after the
scrap-iron was soaked out of it.</p>
<p>Butter wouldn’t kill himself with the life-preserver in sight, and so
I had an idea. I took it to a pawnshop, and [soaked] it for a revolver:
The pawnbroker didn’t think much of the exchange, but when I explained
the situation he acquiesced. We went up on top of a high building, and
this is what happened to the poet:</p>
<p>He put the revolver to his forehead and blew a tunnel straight
through his head. The tunnel was about the size of your finger. You
could look right through it. The job was complete; there was nothing in
it.</p>
<p>Well, after that that man never could write prose, but he could write
poetry. He could write it after he had blown his brains out. There is
lots of that talent all over the country, but the trouble is they don’t
develop it.</p>
<p>I am suffering now from the fact that I, who have told the truth a
good many times in my life, have lately received more letters than
anybody else urging me to lead a righteous life. I have more friends who
want to see me develop on a high level than anybody else.</p>
<p>Young John D. Rockefeller, two weeks ago, taught his Bible class all
about veracity, and why it was better that everybody should always keep
a plentiful supply on hand. Some of the letters I have received suggest
that I ought to attend his class and learn, too. Why, I know
Mr. Rockefeller, and he is a good fellow. He is competent in many ways
to teach a Bible class, but when it comes to veracity he is only
thirty-five years old. I’m seventy years old. I have been familiar with
veracity twice as long as he.</p>
<p>And the story about George Washington and his little hatchet has also
been suggested to me in these letters–in a fugitive way, as if I needed
some of George Washington and his hatchet in my constitution. Why, dear
me, they overlook the real point in that story. The point is not the one
that is usually suggested, and you can readily see that.</p>
<p>The point is not that George said to his father, “Yes, father, I cut
down the cheery-tree; I can’t tell a lie,“ but that the little boy–only
seven years old–should have his sagacity developed under such
circumstances. He was a boy wise beyond his years. His conduct then was
a prophecy of later years. Yes, I think he was the most remarkable man
the country ever produced-up to my time, anyway.</p>
<p>Now then, little George realized that circumstantial evidence was
against him. He knew that his father would know from the size of the
chips that no full-grown hatchet cut that tree down, and that no man
would have haggled it so. He knew that his father would send around the
plantation and inquire for a small boy with a hatchet, and he had the
wisdom to come out and confess it. Now, the idea that his father was
overjoyed when he told little George that he would rather have him cut
down, a thousand cheery-trees than tell a lie is all nonsense. What did
he really mean? Why, that he was absolutely astonished that he had a son
who had the chance to tell a lie and didn’t.</p>
<p>I admire old George–if that was his name–for his discernment. He knew
when he said that his son couldn’t tell a lie that he was stretching it
a good deal. He wouldn’t have to go to John D. Rockefeller’s Bible class
to find that out. The way the old George Washington story goes down it
doesn’t do anybody any good. It only discourages people who can tell a
lie.</p>
<p>WELCOME HOME</p>
<p>ADDRESS AT THE DINNER IN HIS HONOR AT THE LOTOS CLUB, NOVEMBER 10,
1900</p>
<p>In August, 1895, just before sailing for Australia, Mr. Clemens
issued the following statement:</p>
<p>“It has been reported that I sacrificed, for the benefit of the
creditors, the property of the publishing firm whose financial backer I
was, and that I am now lecturing for my own benefit.</p>
<p>“This is an error. I intend the lectures, as well as the property,
for the creditors. The law recognizes no mortgage on a man’s brains, and
a merchant who has given up all he has may take advantage of the laws of
insolvency and may start free again for himself. But I am not a business
man, and honor is a harder master than the law. It cannot compromise for
less than one hundred cents on a dollar, and its debts are never
outlawed.</p>
<p>“I had a two-thirds interest in the publishing firm whose capital I
furnished. If the firm had prospered I would have expected to collect
two-thirds of the profits. As it is, I expect to pay all the debts. My
partner has no resources, and I do not look for assistance to my wife,
whose contributions in cash from her own means have nearly equalled the
claims of all the creditors combined. She has taken nothing; on the
contrary, she has helped and intends to help me to satisfy the
obligations due to the rest of the creditors.</p>
<p>“It is my intention to ask my creditors to accept that as a legal
discharge, and trust to my honor to pay the other fifty per cent. as
fast as I can earn it. From my reception thus far on my lecturing tour,
I am confident that if I live I can pay off the last debt within four
years.</p>
<p>“After which, at the age of sixty-four, I can make a fresh and
unincumbered start in life. I am going to Australia, India, and South
Africa, and next year I hope to make a tour of the great cities of the
United States.“</p>
<p>I thank you all out of my heart for this fraternal welcome, and it
seems almost too fine, almost too magnificent, for a humble Missourian
such as I am, far from his native haunts on the banks of the
Mississippi; yet my modesty is in a degree fortified by observing that I
am not the only Missourian who has been honored here to-night, for I see
at this very table-here is a Missourian [indicating Mr. McKelway], and
there is a Missourian [indicating Mr. Depew], and there is another
Missourian–and Hendrix and Clemens; and last but not least, the greatest
Missourian of them all–here he sits–Tom Reed, who has always concealed
his birth till now. And since I have been away I know what has been
happening in his case: he has deserted politics, and now is leading a
creditable life. He has reformed, and God prosper him; and I judge, by a
remark which he made up-stairs awhile ago, that he had found a new
business that is utterly suited to his make and constitution, and all he
is doing now is that he is around raising the average of personal
beauty.</p>
<p>But I am grateful to the president for the kind words which he has
said of me, and it is not for me to say whether these praises were
deserved or not. I prefer to accept them just as they stand, without
concerning myself with the statistics upon which they have been built,
but only with that large matter, that essential matter, the
good-fellowship, the kindliness, the magnanimity, and generosity that
prompted their utterance. Well, many things have happened since I sat
here before, and now that I think of it, the president’s reference to
the debts which were left by the bankrupt firm of Charles L. Webster
andandandand Co. gives me an opportunity to say a word which I very much
wish to say, not for myself, but for ninety-five men and women whom I
shall always hold in high esteem and in pleasant remembrance–the
creditors of that firm. They treated me well; they treated me
handsomely. There were ninety-six of them, and by not a finger’s weight
did ninety-five of them add to the burden of that time for me.
Ninety-five out of the ninety-six–they didn’t indicate by any word or
sign that they were anxious about their money. They treated me well, and
I shall not forget it; I could not forget it if I wanted to. Many of
them said, “Don’t you worry, don’t you hurry“; that’s what they said.
Why, if I could have that kind of creditors always, and that experience,
I would recognize it as a personal loss to be out of debt. I owe those
ninety-five creditors a debt of homage, and I pay it now in such measure
as one may pay so fine a debt in mere words. Yes, they said that very
thing. I was not personally acquainted with ten of them, and yet they
said, “Don’t you worry, and don’t you hurry.“ I know that phrase by
heart, and if all the other music should perish out of the world it
would still sing to me. I appreciate that; I am glad to say this word;
people say so much about me, and they forget those creditors. They were
handsomer than I was–or Tom Reed.</p>
<p>Oh, you have been doing many things in this time that I have been
absent; you have done lots of things, some that are well worth
remembering, too. Now, we have fought a righteous war since I have gone,
and that is rare in history–a righteous war is so rare that it is almost
unknown in history; but by the grace of that war we set Cuba free, and
we joined her to those three or four nations that exist on this earth;
and we started out to set those poor Filipinos free, too, and why, why,
why that most righteous purpose of ours has apparently miscarried I
suppose I never shall know.</p>
<p>But we have made a most creditable record in China in these days–our
sound and level-headed administration has made a most creditable record
over there, and there are some of the Powers that cannot say that by any
means. The Yellow Terror is threatening this world to-day. It is looming
vast and ominous on that distant horizon. I do not know what is going to
be the result of that Yellow Terror, but our government has had no hand
in evoking it, and let’s be happy in that and proud of it.</p>
<p>We have nursed free silver, we watched by its cradle; we have done
the best we could to raise that child, but those pestiferous Republicans
have –well, they keep giving it the measles every chance they get, and
we never shall raise that child. Well, that’s no matter–there’s plenty
of other things to do, and we must think of something else. Well, we
have tried a President four years, criticised him and found fault with
him the whole time, and turned around a day or two ago with votes enough
to spare to elect another. O consistency! consistency! thy name–I don’t
know what thy name is–Thompson will do–any name will do–but you see
there is the fact, there is the consistency. Then we have tried for
governor an illustrious Rough Rider, and we liked him so much in that
great office that now we have made him Vice-President–not in order that
that office shall give him distinction, but that he may confer
distinction upon that office. And it’s needed, too–it’s needed. And now,
for a while anyway, we shall not be stammering and embarrassed when a
stranger asks us, “What is the name of the Vice-President?“ This one is
known; this one is pretty well known, pretty widely known, and in some
quarters favorably. I am not accustomed to dealing in these fulsome
compliments, and I am probably overdoing it a little; but–well, my old
affectionate admiration for Governor Roosevelt has probably betrayed me
into the complimentary excess; but I know him, and you know him; and if
you give him rope enough–I mean if–oh yes, he will justify that
compliment; leave it just as it is. And now we have put in his place
Mr. Odell, another Rough Rider, I suppose; all the fat things go to that
profession now. Why, I could have been a Rough Rider myself if I had
known that this political Klondike was going to open up, and I would
have been a Rough Rider if I could have gone to war on an automobile but
not on a horse! No, I know the horse too well; I have known the horse in
war and in peace, and there is no place where a horse is comfortable.
The horse has too many caprices, and he is too much given to initiative.
He invents too many new ideas. No, I don’t want anything to do with a
horse.</p>
<p>And then we have taken Chauncey Depew out of a useful and active life
and made him a Senator–embalmed him, corked him up. And I am not
grieving. That man has said many a true thing about me in his time, and
I always said something would happen to him. Look at that [pointing to
Mr. Depew] gilded mummy! He has made my life a sorrow to me at many a
banquet on both sides of the ocean, and now he has got it. Perish the
hand that pulls that cork!</p>
<p>All these things have happened, all these things have come to pass,
while I have been away, and it just shows how little a Mugwump can be
missed in a cold, unfeeling world, even when he is the last one that is
left –a GRAND OLD PARTY all by himself. And there is another thing that
has happened, perhaps the most imposing event of them all: the
institution called the Daughters of the–Crown–the Daughters of the Royal
Crown–has established itself and gone into business. Now, there’s an
American idea for you; there’s an idea born of God knows what kind of
specialized insanity, but not softening of the brain–you cannot soften a
thing that doesn’t exist–the Daughters of the Royal Crown! Nobody
eligible but American descendants of Charles II. Dear me, how the fancy
product of that old harem still holds out!</p>
<p>Well, I am truly glad to foregather with you again, and partake of
the bread and salt of this hospitable house once more. Seven years ago,
when I was your guest here, when I was old and despondent, you gave me
the grip and the word that lift a man up and make him glad to be alive;
and now I come back from my exile young again, fresh and alive, and
ready to begin life once more, and your welcome puts the finishing touch
upon my restored youth and makes it real to me, and not a gracious dream
that must vanish with the morning. I thank you.</p>
<p>AN UNDELIVERED SPEECH</p>
<p>The steamship St. Paul was to have been launched from Cramp’s
shipyard in Philadelphia on March 25, 1895. After the launching a
luncheon was to nave been given, at which Mr. Clemens was to make a
speech. Just before the final word was given a reporter asked
Mr. Clemens for a copy of his speech to be delivered at the luncheon. To
facilitate the work of the reporter he loaned him a typewritten copy of
the speech. It happened, however, that when the blocks were knocked away
the big ship refused to budge, and no amount of labor could move her an
inch. She had stuck fast upon the ways. As a result, the launching was
postponed for a week or two; but in the mean time Mr. Clemens had gone
to Europe. Years after a reporter called on Mr. Clemens and submitted
the manuscript of the speech, which was as follows:</p>
<p>Day after to-morrow I sail for England in a ship of this line, the
Paris. It will be my fourteenth crossing in three years and a half.
Therefore, my presence here, as you see, is quite natural, quite
commercial. I am interested in ships. They interest me more now than
hotels do. When a new ship is launched I feel a desire to go and see if
she will be good quarters for me to live in, particularly if she belongs
to this line, for it is by this line that I have done most of my
ferrying.</p>
<p>People wonder why I go so much. Well, I go partly for my health,
partly to familiarize myself with the road. I have gone over the same
road so many times now that I know all the whales that belong along the
route, and latterly it is an embarrassment to me to meet them, for they
do not look glad to see me, but annoyed, and they seem to say: “Here is
this old derelict again.“</p>
<p>Earlier in life this would have pained me and made me ashamed, but I
am older now, and when I am behaving myself, and doing right, I do not
care for a whale’s opinion about me. When we are young we generally
estimate an opinion by the size of the person that holds it, but later
we find that that is an uncertain rule, for we realize that there are
times when a hornet’s opinion disturbs us more than an emperor’s.</p>
<p>I do not mean that I care nothing at all for a whale’s opinion, for
that would be going to too great a length. Of course, it is better to
have the good opinion of a whale than his disapproval; but my position
is that if you cannot have a whale’s good opinion, except at some
sacrifice of principle or personal dignity, it is better to try to live
without it. That is my idea about whales.</p>
<p>Yes, I have gone over that same route so often that I know my way
without a compass, just by the waves. I know all the large waves and a
good many of the small ones. Also the sunsets. I know every sunset and
where it belongs just by its color. Necessarily, then, I do not make the
passage now for scenery. That is all gone by.</p>
<p>What I prize most is safety, and in, the second place swift transit
and handiness. These are best furnished, by the American line, whose
watertight compartments have no passage through them; no doors to be
left open, and consequently no way for water to get from one of them to
another in time of collision. If you nullify the peril which collisions
threaten you with, you nullify the only very serious peril which attends
voyages in the great liners of our day, and makes voyaging safer than
staying at home.</p>
<p>When the Paris was half-torn to pieces some years ago, enough of the
Atlantic ebbed and flowed through one end of her, during her long agony,
to sink the fleets of the world if distributed among them; but she
floated in perfect safety, and no life was lost. In time of collision
the rock of Gibraltar is not safer than the Paris and other great ships
of this line. This seems to be the only great line in the world that
takes a passenger from metropolis to metropolis without the intervention
of tugs and barges or bridges–takes him through without breaking bulk,
so to speak.</p>
<p>On the English side he lands at a dock; on the dock a special train
is waiting; in an hour and three-quarters he is in, London. Nothing
could be handier. If your journey were from a sand-pit on our side to a
lighthouse on the other, you could make it quicker by other lines, but
that is not the case. The journey is from the city of New York to the
city of London, and no line can do that journey quicker than this one,
nor anywhere near as conveniently and handily. And when the passenger
lands on our side he lands on the American side of the river, not in the
provinces. As a very learned man said on the last voyage (he is head
quartermaster of the New York land garboard streak of the middle
watch)</p>
<p>“When we land a passenger on the American side there’s nothing betwix
him and his hotel but hell and the hackman.“</p>
<p>I am glad, with you and the nation, to welcome the new ship. She is
another pride, another consolation, for a great country whose mighty
fleets have all vanished, and which has almost forgotten, what it is to
fly its flag to sea. I am not sure as to which St. Paul she is named
for. Some think it is the one that is on the upper Mississippi, but the
head quartermaster told me it was the one that killed Goliath. But it is
not important. No matter which it is, let us give her hearty welcome and
godspeed.</p>
