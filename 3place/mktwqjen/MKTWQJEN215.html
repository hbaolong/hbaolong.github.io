<h4 id="information-wanted">INFORMATION WANTED</h4>
<p>“WASHINGTON, December 10, 1867.</p>
<p>“Could you give me any information respecting such islands, if any,
as the government is going to purchase?“</p>
<p>It is an uncle of mine that wants to know. He is an industrious man
and well disposed, and wants to make a living in an honest, humble way,
but more especially he wants to be quiet. He wishes to settle down, and
be quiet and unostentatious. He has been to the new island St. Thomas,
but he says he thinks things are unsettled there. He went there early
with an attache of the State Department, who was sent down with money to
pay for the island. My uncle had his money in the same box, and so when
they went ashore, getting a receipt, the sailors broke open the box and
took all the money, not making any distinction between government money,
which was legitimate money to be stolen, and my uncle’s, which was his
own private property, and should have been respected. But he came home
and got some more and went back. And then he took the fever. There are
seven kinds of fever down there, you know; and, as his blood was out of
order by reason of loss of sleep and general wear and tear of mind, he
failed to cure the first fever, and then somehow he got the other six.
He is not a kind of man that enjoys fevers, though he is well meaning
and always does what he thinks is right, and so he was a good deal
annoyed when it appeared he was going to die.</p>
<p>But he worried through, and got well and started a farm. He fenced it
in, and the next day that great storm came on and washed the most of it
over to Gibraltar, or around there somewhere. He only said, in his
patient way, that it was gone, and he wouldn’t bother about trying to
find out where it went to, though it was his opinion it went to
Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Then he invested in a mountain, and started a farm up there, so as to
be out of the way when the sea came ashore again. It was a good
mountain, and a good farm, but it wasn’t any use; an earthquake came the
next night and shook it all down. It was all fragments, you know, and so
mixed up with another man’s property that he could not tell which were
his fragments without going to law; and he would not do that, because
his main object in going to St. Thomas was to be quiet. All that he
wanted was to settle down and be quiet.</p>
<p>He thought it all over, and finally he concluded to try the low
ground again, especially as he wanted to start a brickyard this time. He
bought a flat, and put out a hundred thousand bricks to dry preparatory
to baking them. But luck appeared to be against him. A volcano shoved
itself through there that night, and elevated his brickyard about two
thousand feet in the air. It irritated him a good deal. He has been up
there, and he says the bricks are all baked right enough, but he can’t
get them down. At first, he thought maybe the government would get the
bricks down for him, because since government bought the island, it
ought to protect the property where a man has invested in good faith;
but all he wants is quiet, and so he is not going to apply for the
subsidy he was thinking about.</p>
<p>He went back there last week in a couple of ships of war, to prospect
around the coast for a safe place for a farm where he could be quiet;
but a great “tidal wave“ came, and hoisted both of the ships out into
one of the interior counties, and he came near losing his life. So he
has given up prospecting in a ship, and is discouraged.</p>
<p>Well, now he don’t know what to do. He has tried Alaska; but the
bears kept after him so much, and kept him so much on the jump, as it
were, that he had to leave the country. He could not be quiet there with
those bears prancing after him all the time. That is how he came to go
to the new island we have bought–St. Thomas. But he is getting to think
St. Thomas is not quiet enough for a man of his turn of mind, and that
is why he wishes me to find out if government is likely to buy some more
islands shortly. He has heard that government is thinking about buying
Porto Rico. If that is true, he wishes to try Porto Rico, if it is a
quiet place. How is Porto Rico for his style of man? Do you think the
government will buy it?</p>
