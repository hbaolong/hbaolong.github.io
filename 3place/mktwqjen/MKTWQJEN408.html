<h4 id="chapter-25-from-cairo-to-hickman">Chapter 25 From Cairo to
Hickman</h4>
<p>THE scenery, from St. Louis to Cairo–two hundred miles–is varied and
beautiful. The hills were clothed in the fresh foliage of spring now,
and were a gracious and worthy setting for the broad river flowing
between. Our trip began auspiciously, with a perfect day, as to breeze
and sunshine, and our boat threw the miles out behind her with
satisfactory despatch.</p>
<p>We found a railway intruding at Chester, Illinois; Chester has also a
penitentiary now, and is otherwise marching on. At Grand Tower, too,
there was a railway; and another at Cape Girardeau. The former town gets
its name from a huge, squat pillar of rock, which stands up out of the
water on the Missouri side of the river–a piece of nature’s fanciful
handiwork–and is one of the most picturesque features of the scenery of
that region. For nearer or remoter neighbors, the Tower has the Devil’s
Bake Oven–so called, perhaps, because it does not powerfully resemble
anybody else’s bake oven; and the Devil’s Tea Table–this latter a great
smooth-surfaced mass of rock, with diminishing wine-glass stem, perched
some fifty or sixty feet above the river, beside a beflowered and
garlanded precipice, and sufficiently like a tea-table to answer for
anybody, Devil or Christian. Away down the river we have the Devil’s
Elbow and the Devil’s Race-course, and lots of other property of his
which I cannot now call to mind.</p>
<p>The Town of Grand Tower was evidently a busier place than it had been
in old times, but it seemed to need some repairs here and there, and a
new coat of whitewash all over. Still, it was pleasant to me to see the
old coat once more. ‘Uncle’ Mumford, our second officer, said the place
had been suffering from high water, and consequently was not looking its
best now. But he said it was not strange that it didn’t waste white-
wash on itself, for more lime was made there, and of a better quality,
than anywhere in the West; and added–‘On a dairy farm you never can get
any milk for your coffee, nor any sugar for it on a sugar plantation;
and it is against sense to go to a lime town to hunt for white-wash.’ In
my own experience I knew the first two items to be true; and also that
people who sell candy don’t care for candy; therefore there was
plausibility in Uncle Mumford’s final observation that ‘people who make
lime run more to religion than whitewash.’ Uncle Mumford said, further,
that Grand Tower was a great coaling center and a prospering place.</p>
<p>Cape Girardeau is situated on a hillside, and makes a handsome
appearance. There is a great Jesuit school for boys at the foot of the
town by the river. Uncle Mumford said it had as high a reputation for
thoroughness as any similar institution in Missouri! There was another
college higher up on an airy summit–a bright new edifice, picturesquely
and peculiarly towered and pinnacled–a sort of gigantic casters, with
the cruets all complete. Uncle Mumford said that Cape Girardeau was the
Athens of Missouri, and contained several colleges besides those already
mentioned; and all of them on a religious basis of one kind or another.
He directed my attention to what he called the ‘strong and pervasive
religious look of the town,’ but I could not see that it looked more
religious than the other hill towns with the same slope and built of the
same kind of bricks. Partialities often make people see more than really
exists.</p>
<p>Uncle Mumford has been thirty years a mate on the river. He is a man
of practical sense and a level head; has observed; has had much
experience of one sort and another; has opinions; has, also, just a
perceptible dash of poetry in his composition, an easy gift of speech, a
thick growl in his voice, and an oath or two where he can get at them
when the exigencies of his office require a spiritual lift. He is a mate
of the blessed old-time kind; and goes gravely damning around, when
there is work to the fore, in a way to mellow the ex-steamboatman’s
heart with sweet soft longings for the vanished days that shall come no
more. ‘GIT up there you! Going to be all day? Why d’n’t you SAY you was
petrified in your hind legs, before you shipped!’</p>
<p>He is a steady man with his crew; kind and just, but firm; so they
like him, and stay with him. He is still in the slouchy garb of the old
generation of mates; but next trip the Anchor Line will have him in
uniform–a natty blue naval uniform, with brass buttons, along with all
the officers of the line–and then he will be a totally different style
of scenery from what he is now.</p>
<p>Uniforms on the Mississippi! It beats all the other changes put
together, for surprise. Still, there is another surprise–that it was not
made fifty years ago. It is so manifestly sensible, that it might have
been thought of earlier, one would suppose. During fifty years, out
there, the innocent passenger in need of help and information, has been
mistaking the mate for the cook, and the captain for the barber–and
being roughly entertained for it, too. But his troubles are ended now.
And the greatly improved aspect of the boat’s staff is another advantage
achieved by the dress-reform period.</p>
<p>Steered down the bend below Cape Girardeau. They used to call it
‘Steersman’s Bend;’ plain sailing and plenty of water in it, always;
about the only place in the Upper River that a new cub was allowed to
take a boat through, in low water.</p>
<p>Thebes, at the head of the Grand Chain, and Commerce at the foot of
it, were towns easily rememberable, as they had not undergone
conspicuous alteration. Nor the Chain, either–in the nature of things;
for it is a chain of sunken rocks admirably arranged to capture and kill
steamboats on bad nights. A good many steamboat corpses lie buried
there, out of sight; among the rest my first friend the ‘Paul Jones;’
she knocked her bottom out, and went down like a pot, so the historian
told me–Uncle Mumford. He said she had a gray mare aboard, and a
preacher. To me, this sufficiently accounted for the disaster; as it
did, of course, to Mumford, who added–</p>
<p>‘But there are many ignorant people who would scoff at such a matter,
and call it superstition. But you will always notice that they are
people who have never traveled with a gray mare and a preacher. I went
down the river once in such company. We grounded at Bloody Island; we
grounded at Hanging Dog; we grounded just below this same Commerce; we
jolted Beaver Dam Rock; we hit one of the worst breaks in the
’Graveyard’ behind Goose Island; we had a roustabout killed in a fight;
we burnt a boiler; broke a shaft; collapsed a flue; and went into Cairo
with nine feet of water in the hold–may have been more, may have been
less. I remember it as if it were yesterday. The men lost their heads
with terror. They painted the mare blue, in sight of town, and threw the
preacher overboard, or we should not have arrived at all. The preacher
was fished out and saved. He acknowledged, himself, that he had been to
blame. I remember it all, as if it were yesterday.’</p>
<p>That this combination–of preacher and gray mare–should breed
calamity, seems strange, and at first glance unbelievable; but the fact
is fortified by so much unassailable proof that to doubt is to dishonor
reason. I myself remember a case where a captain was warned by numerous
friends against taking a gray mare and a preacher with him, but
persisted in his purpose in spite of all that could be said; and the
same day–it may have been the next, and some say it was, though I think
it was the same day–he got drunk and fell down the hatchway, and was
borne to his home a corpse. This is literally true.</p>
<p>No vestige of Hat Island is left now; every shred of it is washed
away. I do not even remember what part of the river it used to be in,
except that it was between St. Louis and Cairo somewhere. It was a bad
region– all around and about Hat Island, in early days. A farmer who
lived on the Illinois shore there, said that twenty-nine steamboats had
left their bones strung along within sight from his house. Between
St. Louis and Cairo the steamboat wrecks average one to the mile;–two
hundred wrecks, altogether.</p>
<p>I could recognize big changes from Commerce down. Beaver Dam Rock was
out in the middle of the river now, and throwing a prodigious ‘break;’
it used to be close to the shore, and boats went down outside of it. A
big island that used to be away out in mid-river, has retired to the
Missouri shore, and boats do not go near it any more. The island called
Jacket Pattern is whittled down to a wedge now, and is booked for early
destruction. Goose Island is all gone but a little dab the size of a
steamboat. The perilous ‘Graveyard,’ among whose numberless wrecks we
used to pick our way so slowly and gingerly, is far away from the
channel now, and a terror to nobody. One of the islands formerly called
the Two Sisters is gone entirely; the other, which used to lie close to
the Illinois shore, is now on the Missouri side, a mile away; it is
joined solidly to the shore, and it takes a sharp eye to see where the
seam is–but it is Illinois ground yet, and the people who live on it
have to ferry themselves over and work the Illinois roads and pay
Illinois taxes: singular state of things!</p>
<p>Near the mouth of the river several islands were missing–washed away.
Cairo was still there–easily visible across the long, flat point upon
whose further verge it stands; but we had to steam a long way around to
get to it. Night fell as we were going out of the ‘Upper River’ and
meeting the floods of the Ohio. We dashed along without anxiety; for the
hidden rock which used to lie right in the way has moved up stream a
long distance out of the channel; or rather, about one county has gone
into the river from the Missouri point, and the Cairo point has ‘made
down’ and added to its long tongue of territory correspondingly. The
Mississippi is a just and equitable river; it never tumbles one man’s
farm overboard without building a new farm just like it for that man’s
neighbor. This keeps down hard feelings.</p>
<p>Going into Cairo, we came near killing a steamboat which paid no
attention to our whistle and then tried to cross our bows. By doing some
strong backing, we saved him; which was a great loss, for he would have
made good literature.</p>
<p>Cairo is a brisk town now; and is substantially built, and has a city
look about it which is in noticeable contrast to its former estate, as
per Mr. Dickens’s portrait of it. However, it was already building with
bricks when I had seen it last–which was when Colonel (now General)
Grant was drilling his first command there. Uncle Mumford says the
libraries and Sunday-schools have done a good work in Cairo, as well as
the brick masons. Cairo has a heavy railroad and river trade, and her
situation at the junction of the two great rivers is so advantageous
that she cannot well help prospering.</p>
<p>When I turned out, in the morning, we had passed Columbus, Kentucky,
and were approaching Hickman, a pretty town, perched on a handsome hill.
Hickman is in a rich tobacco region, and formerly enjoyed a great and
lucrative trade in that staple, collecting it there in her warehouses
from a large area of country and shipping it by boat; but Uncle Mumford
says she built a railway to facilitate this commerce a little more, and
he thinks it facilitated it the wrong way–took the bulk of the trade out
of her hands by ‘collaring it along the line without gathering it at her
doors.’</p>
