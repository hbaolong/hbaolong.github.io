<h4 id="chapter-iii.">CHAPTER III.</h4>
<p>It is more trouble to make a maxim than it is to do right.
–Pudd’nhead Wilson’s New Calendar.</p>
<p>On the seventh day out we saw a dim vast bulk standing up out of the
wastes of the Pacific and knew that that spectral promontory was Diamond
Head, a piece of this world which I had not seen before for twenty-nine
years. So we were nearing Honolulu, the capital city of the Sandwich
Islands–those islands which to me were Paradise; a Paradise which I had
been longing all those years to see again. Not any other thing in the
world could have stirred me as the sight of that great rock did.</p>
<p>In the night we anchored a mile from shore. Through my port I could
see the twinkling lights of Honolulu and the dark bulk of the
mountain-range that stretched away right and left. I could not make out
the beautiful Nuuana valley, but I knew where it lay, and remembered how
it used to look in the old times. We used to ride up it on horseback in
those days –we young people–and branch off and gather bones in a sandy
region where one of the first Kamehameha’s battles was fought. He was a
remarkable man, for a king; and he was also a remarkable man for a
savage. He was a mere kinglet and of little or no consequence at the
time of Captain Cook’s arrival in 1788; but about four years afterward
he conceived the idea of enlarging his sphere of influence. That is a
courteous modern phrase which means robbing your neighbor–for your
neighbor’s benefit; and the great theater of its benevolences is Africa.
Kamehameha went to war, and in the course of ten years he whipped out
all the other kings and made himself master of every one of the nine or
ten islands that form the group. But he did more than that. He bought
ships, freighted them with sandal wood and other native products, and
sent them as far as South America and China; he sold to his savages the
foreign stuffs and tools and utensils which came back in these ships,
and started the march of civilization. It is doubtful if the match to
this extraordinary thing is to be found in the history of any other
savage. Savages are eager to learn from the white man any new way to
kill each other, but it is not their habit to seize with avidity and
apply with energy the larger and nobler ideas which he offers them. The
details of Kamehameha’s history show that he was always hospitably ready
to examine the white man’s ideas, and that he exercised a tidy
discrimination in making his selections from the samples placed on
view.</p>
<p>A shrewder discrimination than was exhibited by his son and
successor, Liholiho, I think. Liholiho could have qualified as a
reformer, perhaps, but as a king he was a mistake. A mistake because he
tried to be both king and reformer. This is mixing fire and gunpowder
together. A king has no proper business with reforming. His best policy
is to keep things as they are; and if he can’t do that, he ought to try
to make them worse than they are. This is not guesswork; I have thought
over this matter a good deal, so that if I should ever have a chance to
become a king I would know how to conduct the business in the best
way.</p>
<p>When Liholiho succeeded his father he found himself possessed of an
equipment of royal tools and safeguards which a wiser king would have
known how to husband, and judiciously employ, and make profitable. The
entire country was under the one scepter, and his was that scepter.
There was an Established Church, and he was the head of it. There was a
Standing Army, and he was the head of that; an Army of 114 privates
under command of 27 Generals and a Field Marshal. There was a proud and
ancient Hereditary Nobility. There was still one other asset. This was
the tabu–an agent endowed with a mysterious and stupendous power, an
agent not found among the properties of any European monarch, a tool of
inestimable value in the business. Liholiho was headmaster of the tabu.
The tabu was the most ingenious and effective of all the inventions that
has ever been devised for keeping a people’s privileges satisfactorily
restricted.</p>
<p>It required the sexes to live in separate houses. It did not allow
people to eat in either house; they must eat in another place. It did
not allow a man’s woman-folk to enter his house. It did not allow the
sexes to eat together; the men must eat first, and the women must wait
on them. Then the women could eat what was left–if anything was left–and
wait on themselves. I mean, if anything of a coarse or unpalatable sort
was left, the women could have it. But not the good things, the fine
things, the choice things, such as pork, poultry, bananas, cocoanuts,
the choicer varieties of fish, and so on. By the tabu, all these were
sacred to the men; the women spent their lives longing for them and
wondering what they might taste like; and they died without finding
out.</p>
<p>These rules, as you see, were quite simple and clear. It was easy to
remember them; and useful. For the penalty for infringing any rule in
the whole list was death. Those women easily learned to put up with
shark and taro and dog for a diet when the other things were so
expensive.</p>
<p>It was death for any one to walk upon tabu’d ground; or defile a
tabu’d thing with his touch; or fail in due servility to a chief; or
step upon the king’s shadow. The nobles and the King and the priests
were always suspending little rags here and there and yonder, to give
notice to the people that the decorated spot or thing was tabu, and
death lurking near. The struggle for life was difficult and chancy in
the islands in those days.</p>
<p>Thus advantageously was the new king situated. Will it be believed
that the first thing he did was to destroy his Established Church, root
and branch? He did indeed do that. To state the case figuratively, he
was a prosperous sailor who burnt his ship and took to a raft. This
Church was a horrid thing. It heavily oppressed the people; it kept them
always trembling in the gloom of mysterious threatenings; it slaughtered
them in sacrifice before its grotesque idols of wood and stone; it cowed
them, it terrorized them, it made them slaves to its priests, and
through the priests to the king. It was the best friend a king could
have, and the most dependable. To a professional reformer who should
annihilate so frightful and so devastating a power as this Church,
reverence and praise would be due; but to a king who should do it, could
properly be due nothing but reproach; reproach softened by sorrow;
sorrow for his unfitness for his position.</p>
<p>He destroyed his Established Church, and his kingdom is a republic
today, in consequence of that act.</p>
<p>When he destroyed the Church and burned the idols he did a mighty
thing for civilization and for his people’s weal–but it was not
“business.“ It was unkingly, it was inartistic. It made trouble for his
line. The American missionaries arrived while the burned idols were
still smoking. They found the nation without a religion, and they
repaired the defect. They offered their own religion and it was gladly
received. But it was no support to arbitrary kingship, and so the kingly
power began to weaken from that day. Forty-seven years later, when I was
in the islands, Kainehameha V. was trying to repair Liholiho’s blunder,
and not succeeding. He had set up an Established Church and made himself
the head of it. But it was only a pinchbeck thing, an imitation, a
bauble, an empty show. It had no power, no value for a king. It could
not harry or burn or slay, it in no way resembled the admirable machine
which Liholiho destroyed. It was an Established Church without an
Establishment; all the people were Dissenters.</p>
<p>Long before that, the kingship had itself become but a name, a show.
At an early day the missionaries had turned it into something very much
like a republic; and here lately the business whites have turned it into
something exactly like it.</p>
<p>In Captain Cook’s time (1778), the native population of the islands
was estimated at 400,000; in 1836 at something short of 200,000, in 1866
at 50,000; it is to-day, per census, 25,000. All intelligent people
praise Kamehameha I. and Liholiho for conferring upon their people the
great boon of civilization. I would do it myself, but my intelligence is
out of repair, now, from over-work.</p>
<p>When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was acquainted
with a young American couple who had among their belongings an
attractive little son of the age of seven–attractive but not practicably
companionable with me, because he knew no English. He had played from
his birth with the little Kanakas on his father’s plantation, and had
preferred their language and would learn no other. The family removed to
America a month after I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boy
began to lose his Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelve
be hadn’t a word of Kanaka left; the language had wholly departed from
his tongue and from his comprehension. Nine years later, when he was
twenty-one, I came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New York,
and the mother told me about an adventure which her son had been having.
By trade he was now a professional diver. A passenger boat had been
caught in a storm on the lake, and had gone down, carrying her people
with her. A few days later the young diver descended, with his armor on,
and entered the berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the foot of the
companionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim water.
Presently something touched him on the shoulder, and he turned and found
a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and seemingly inspecting him
inquiringly. He was paralyzed with fright. His entry had disturbed the
water, and now he discerned a number of dim corpses making for him and
wagging their heads and swaying their bodies like sleepy people trying
to dance. His senses forsook him, and in that condition he was drawn to
the surface. He was put to bed at home, and was soon very ill. During
some days he had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a
time; and while they lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly; and
Kanaka only. He was still very ill, and he talked to me in that tongue;
but I did not understand it, of course. The doctor-books tell us that
cases like this are not uncommon. Then the doctors ought to study the
cases and find out how to multiply them. Many languages and things get
mislaid in a person’s head, and stay mislaid for lack of this
remedy.</p>
<p>Many memories of my former visit to the islands came up in my mind
while we lay at anchor in front of Honolulu that night. And
pictures–pictures pictures–an enchanting procession of them! I was
impatient for the morning to come.</p>
<p>When it came it brought disappointment, of course. Cholera had broken
out in the town, and we were not allowed to have any communication with
the shore. Thus suddenly did my dream of twenty-nine years go to ruin.
Messages came from friends, but the friends themselves I was not to have
any sight of. My lecture-hall was ready, but I was not to see that,
either.</p>
<p>Several of our passengers belonged in Honolulu, and these were sent
ashore; but nobody could go ashore and return. There were people on
shore who were booked to go with us to Australia, but we could not
receive them; to do it would cost us a quarantine-term in Sydney. They
could have escaped the day before, by ship to San Francisco; but the
bars had been put up, now, and they might have to wait weeks before any
ship could venture to give them a passage any whither. And there were
hardships for others. An elderly lady and her son, recreation-seekers
from Massachusetts, had wandered westward, further and further from
home, always intending to take the return track, but always concluding
to go still a little further; and now here they were at anchor before
Honolulu positively their last westward-bound indulgence–they had made
up their minds to that–but where is the use in making up your mind in
this world? It is usually a waste of time to do it. These two would have
to stay with us as far as Australia. Then they could go on around the
world, or go back the way they had come; the distance and the
accommodations and outlay of time would be just the same, whichever of
the two routes they might elect to take. Think of it: a projected
excursion of five hundred miles gradually enlarged, without any
elaborate degree of intention, to a possible twenty-four thousand.
However, they were used to extensions by this time, and did not mind
this new one much.</p>
<p>And we had with us a lawyer from Victoria, who had been sent out by
the Government on an international matter, and he had brought his wife
with him and left the children at home with the servants and now what
was to be done? Go ashore amongst the cholera and take the risks? Most
certainly not. They decided to go on, to the Fiji islands, wait there a
fortnight for the next ship, and then sail for home. They couldn’t
foresee that they wouldn’t see a homeward-bound ship again for six
weeks, and that no word could come to them from the children, and no
word go from them to the children in all that time. It is easy to make
plans in this world; even a cat can do it; and when one is out in those
remote oceans it is noticeable that a cat’s plans and a man’s are worth
about the same. There is much the same shrinkage in both, in the matter
of values.</p>
<p>There was nothing for us to do but sit about the decks in the shade
of the awnings and look at the distant shore. We lay in luminous blue
water; shoreward the water was green-green and brilliant; at the shore
itself it broke in a long white ruffle, and with no crash, no sound that
we could hear. The town was buried under a mat of foliage that looked
like a cushion of moss. The silky mountains were clothed in soft, rich
splendors of melting color, and some of the cliffs were veiled in
slanting mists. I recognized it all. It was just as I had seen it long
before, with nothing of its beauty lost, nothing of its charm
wanting.</p>
<p>A change had come, but that was political, and not visible from the
ship. The monarchy of my day was gone, and a republic was sitting in its
seat. It was not a material change. The old imitation pomps, the fuss
and feathers, have departed, and the royal trademark–that is about all
that one could miss, I suppose. That imitation monarchy, was grotesque
enough, in my time; if it had held on another thirty years it would have
been a monarchy without subjects of the king’s race.</p>
<p>We had a sunset of a very fine sort. The vast plain of the sea was
marked off in bands of sharply-contrasted colors: great stretches of
dark blue, others of purple, others of polished bronze; the billowy
mountains showed all sorts of dainty browns and greens, blues and
purples and blacks, and the rounded velvety backs of certain of them
made one want to stroke them, as one would the sleek back of a cat. The
long, sloping promontory projecting into the sea at the west turned dim
and leaden and spectral, then became suffused with pink–dissolved itself
in a pink dream, so to speak, it seemed so airy and unreal. Presently
the cloud-rack was flooded with fiery splendors, and these were copied
on the surface of the sea, and it made one drunk with delight to look
upon it.</p>
<p>From talks with certain of our passengers whose home was Honolulu,
and from a sketch by Mrs. Mary H. Krout, I was able to perceive what the
Honolulu of to-day is, as compared with the Honolulu of my time. In my
time it was a beautiful little town, made up of snow-white wooden
cottages deliciously smothered in tropical vines and flowers and trees
and shrubs; and its coral roads and streets were hard and smooth, and as
white as the houses. The outside aspects of the place suggested the
presence of a modest and comfortable prosperity–a general prosperity
–perhaps one might strengthen the term and say universal. There were no
fine houses, no fine furniture. There were no decorations. Tallow
candles furnished the light for the bedrooms, a whale-oil lamp furnished
it for the parlor. Native matting served as carpeting. In the parlor one
would find two or three lithographs on the walls–portraits as a rule:
Kamehameha IV., Louis Kossuth, Jenny Lind; and may be an engraving or
two: Rebecca at the Well, Moses smiting the rock, Joseph’s servants
finding the cup in Benjamin’s sack. There would be a center table, with
books of a tranquil sort on it: The Whole Duty of Man, Baxter’s Saints’
Rest, Fox’s Martyrs, Tupper’s Proverbial Philosophy, bound copies of The
Missionary Herald and of Father Damon’s Seaman’s Friend. A melodeon; a
music stand, with ‘Willie, We have Missed You’, ‘Star of the Evening’,
‘Roll on Silver Moon’, ‘Are We Most There’, ‘I Would not Live Alway’,
and other songs of love and sentiment, together with an assortment of
hymns. A what-not with semi-globular glass paperweights, enclosing
miniature pictures of ships, New England rural snowstorms, and the like;
sea-shells with Bible texts carved on them in cameo style; native
curios; whale’s tooth with full-rigged ship carved on it. There was
nothing reminiscent of foreign parts, for nobody had been abroad. Trips
were made to San Francisco, but that could not be called going abroad.
Comprehensively speaking, nobody traveled.</p>
<p>But Honolulu has grown wealthy since then, and of course wealth has
introduced changes; some of the old simplicities have disappeared. Here
is a modern house, as pictured by Mrs. Krout:</p>
<p>“Almost every house is surrounded by extensive lawns and gardens
enclosed by walls of volcanic stone or by thick hedges of the brilliant
hibiscus.</p>
<p>“The houses are most tastefully and comfortably furnished; the floors
are either of hard wood covered with rugs or with fine Indian matting,
while there is a preference, as in most warm countries, for rattan or
bamboo furniture; there are the usual accessories of bric-a-brac,
pictures, books, and curios from all parts of the world, for these
island dwellers are indefatigable travelers.</p>
<p>“Nearly every house has what is called a lanai. It is a large
apartment, roofed, floored, open on three sides, with a door or a draped
archway opening into the drawing-room. Frequently the roof is formed by
the thick interlacing boughs of the hou tree, impervious to the sun and
even to the rain, except in violent storms. Vines are trained about the
sides–the stephanotis or some one of the countless fragrant and
blossoming trailers which abound in the islands. There are also curtains
of matting that may be drawn to exclude the sun or rain. The floor is
bare for coolness, or partially covered with rugs, and the lanai is
prettily furnished with comfortable chairs, sofas, and tables loaded
with flowers, or wonderful ferns in pots.</p>
<p>“The lanai is the favorite reception room, and here at any social
function the musical program is given and cakes and ices are served;
here morning callers are received, or gay riding parties, the ladies in
pretty divided skirts, worn for convenience in riding astride, –the
universal mode adopted by Europeans and Americans, as well as by the
natives.</p>
<p>“The comfort and luxury of such an apartment, especially at a
seashore villa, can hardly be imagined. The soft breezes sweep across
it, heavy with the fragrance of jasmine and gardenia, and through the
swaying boughs of palm and mimosa there are glimpses of rugged
mountains, their summits veiled in clouds, of purple sea with the white
surf beating eternally against the reefs, whiter still in the yellow
sunlight or the magical moonlight of the tropics.“</p>
<p>There: rugs, ices, pictures, lanais, worldly books, sinful
bric-a-brac fetched from everywhere. And the ladies riding astride.
These are changes, indeed. In my time the native women rode astride, but
the white ones lacked the courage to adopt their wise custom. In my time
ice was seldom seen in Honolulu. It sometimes came in sailing vessels
from New England as ballast; and then, if there happened to be a
man-of-war in port and balls and suppers raging by consequence, the
ballast was worth six hundred dollars a ton, as is evidenced by
reputable tradition. But the ice-machine has traveled all over the
world, now, and brought ice within everybody’s reach. In Lapland and
Spitzbergen no one uses native ice in our day, except the bears and the
walruses.</p>
<p>The bicycle is not mentioned. It was not necessary. We know that it
is there, without inquiring. It is everywhere. But for it, people could
never have had summer homes on the summit of Mont Blanc; before its day,
property up there had but a nominal value. The ladies of the Hawaiian
capital learned too late the right way to occupy a horse–too late to get
much benefit from it. The riding-horse is retiring from business
everywhere in the world. In Honolulu a few years from now he will be
only a tradition.</p>
<p>We all know about Father Damien, the French priest who voluntarily
forsook the world and went to the leper island of Molokai to labor among
its population of sorrowful exiles who wait there, in slow-consuming
misery, for death to cone and release them from their troubles; and we
know that the thing which he knew beforehand would happen, did happen:
that he became a leper himself, and died of that horrible disease. There
was still another case of self-sacrifice, it appears. I asked after
“Billy“ Ragsdale, interpreter to the Parliament in my time–a half-white.
He was a brilliant young fellow, and very popular. As an interpreter he
would have been hard to match anywhere. He used to stand up in the
Parliament and turn the English speeches into Hawaiian and the Hawaiian
speeches into English with a readiness and a volubility that were
astonishing. I asked after him, and was told that his prosperous career
was cut short in a sudden and unexpected way, just as he was about to
marry a beautiful half-caste girl. He discovered, by some nearly
invisible sign about his skin, that the poison of leprosy was in him.
The secret was his own, and might be kept concealed for years; but he
would not be treacherous to the girl that loved him; he would not marry
her to a doom like his. And so he put his affairs in order, and went
around to all his friends and bade them good-bye, and sailed in the
leper ship to Molokai. There he died the loathsome and lingering death
that all lepers die.</p>
<p>In this place let me insert a paragraph or two from “The Paradise of
the Pacific“ (Rev. H. H. Gowen)–</p>
<p>“Poor lepers! It is easy for those who have no relatives or friends
among them to enforce the decree of segregation to the letter, but who
can write of the terrible, the heart-breaking scenes which that
enforcement has brought about?</p>
<p>“A man upon Hawaii was suddenly taken away after a summary arrest,
leaving behind him a helpless wife about to give birth to a babe. The
devoted wife with great pain and risk came the whole journey to
Honolulu, and pleaded until the authorities were unable to resist her
entreaty that she might go and live like a leper with her leper
husband.</p>
<p>“A woman in the prime of life and activity is condemned as an
incipient leper, suddenly removed from her home, and her husband returns
to find his two helpless babes moaning for their lost mother.</p>
<p>“Imagine it! The case of the babies is hard, but its bitterness is a
trifle–less than a trifle–less than nothing–compared to what the mother
must suffer; and suffer minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day,
month by month, year by year, without respite, relief, or any abatement
of her pain till she dies.</p>
<p>“One woman, Luka Kaaukau, has been living with her leper husband in
the settlement for twelve years. The man has scarcely a joint left, his
limbs are only distorted ulcerated stumps, for four years his wife has
put every particle of food into his mouth. He wanted his wife to abandon
his wretched carcass long ago, as she herself was sound and well, but
Luka said that she was content to remain and wait on the man she loved
till the spirit should be freed from its burden.</p>
<p>“I myself have known hard cases enough:–of a girl, apparently in full
health, decorating the church with me at Easter, who before Christmas is
taken away as a confirmed leper; of a mother hiding her child in the
mountains for years so that not even her dearest friends knew that she
had a child alive, that he might not be taken away; of a respectable
white man taken away from his wife and family, and compelled to become a
dweller in the Leper Settlement, where he is counted dead, even by the
insurance companies.“</p>
<p>And one great pity of it all is, that these poor sufferers are
innocent. The leprosy does not come of sins which they committed, but of
sins committed by their ancestors, who escaped the curse of leprosy!</p>
<p>Mr. Gowan has made record of a certain very striking circumstance.
Would you expect to find in that awful Leper Settlement a custom worthy
to be transplanted to your own country? They have one such, and it is
inexpressibly touching and beautiful. When death sets open the
prison-door of life there, the band salutes the freed soul with a burst
of glad music!</p>
