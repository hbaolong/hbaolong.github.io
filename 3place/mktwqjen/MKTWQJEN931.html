1892, CHIEFLY TO MR. HALL AND MRS. CRANE. IN BERLIN, MENTONE,
BAD-NAUHEIM, FLORENCE</h4>
<p>Mark Twain was the notable literary figure in Berlin that winter, the
center of every great gathering. He was entertained by the Kaiser, and
shown many special attentions by Germans of every rank. His books were
as well known in Berlin as in New York, and at court assemblies and
embassies he was always a chief center of interest.</p>
<p>He was too popular for his own good; the gaiety of the capital told
on him. Finally, one night, after delivering a lecture in a hot room, he
contracted a severe cold, driving to a ball at General von Versen’s, and
a few days later was confined to his bed with pneumonia. It was not a
severe attack, but it was long continued. He could write some letters
and even work a little, but he was not allowed to leave his bed for many
weeks, a condition which he did not find a hardship, for no man ever
enjoyed the loose luxury of undress and the comfort of pillows more than
Mark Twain. In a memorandum of that time he wrote: “I am having a
booming time all to myself.“</p>
<p>Meantime, Hall, in America, was sending favorable reports of the
publishing business, and this naturally helped to keep up his spirits.
He wrote frequently to Hall, of course, but the letters for the most
part are purely of a business nature and of little interest to the
general reader.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>HOTEL ROYAL, BERLIN, Feb. 12. DEAR MR. HALL,–Daly wants to get the
stage rights of the “American Claimant.“ The foundation from which I
wrote the story is a play of the same name which has been in A. P.
Burbank’s hands 5 or 6 years. That play cost me some money (helping
Burbank stage it) but has never brought me any. I have written Burbank
(Lotos Club) and asked him to give me back his rights in the old play so
that I can treat with Daly and utilize this chance to even myself up.
Burbank is a lovely fellow, and if he objects I can’t urge him. But you
run in at the Lotos and see him; and if he relinquishes his claim, then
I would like you to conduct the business with Daly; or have Whitford or
some other lawyer do it under your supervision if you prefer.</p>
<p>This morning I seem to have rheumatism in my right foot.</p>
<p>I am ordered south by the doctor and shall expect to be well enough
to start by the end of this month.</p>
<p>[No signature.]</p>
<p>It is curious, after Clemens and Howells had tried so hard and so
long to place their “Sellers“ Play, that now, when the story appeared in
book form, Augustin Daly should have thought it worth dramatizing. Daly
and Clemens were old friends, and it would seem that Daly could hardly
have escaped seeing the play when it was going the rounds. But perhaps
there is nothing more mysterious in the world than the ways and wants of
theatrical managers. The matter came to nothing, of course, but the fact
that Daly should have thought a story built from an old discarded play
had a play in it seems interesting.</p>
<p>Clemens and his wife were advised to leave the cold of Berlin as soon
as he was able to travel. This was not until the first of March, when,
taking their old courier, Joseph Very, they left the children in good
hands and journeyed to the south of France.</p>
<p>To Susy Clemens, in Berlin:</p>
<p>MENTONE, Mch 22, ’92. SUSY DEAR,–I have been delighted to note your
easy facility with your pen and proud to note also your literary
superiorities of one kind and another–clearness of statement,
directness, felicity of expression, photographic ability in setting
forth an incident–style–good style–no barnacles on it in the way of
unnecessary, retarding words (the Shipman scrapes off the barnacles when
he wants his racer to go her best gait and straight to the buoy.) You
should write a letter every day, long or short –and so ought I, but I
don’t.</p>
<p>Mamma says, tell Clara yes, she will have to write a note if the fan
comes back mended.</p>
<p>We couldn’t go to Nice to-day–had to give it up, on various accounts
–and this was the last chance. I am sorry for Mamma–I wish she could
have gone. She got a heavy fall yesterday evening and was pretty stiff
and lame this morning, but is working it off trunk packing.</p>
<p>Joseph is gone to Nice to educate himself in Kodaking–and to get the
pictures mounted which Mamma thinks she took here; but I noticed she
didn’t take the plug out, as a rule. When she did, she took nine
pictures on top of each other–composites. With lots of love. PAPA.</p>
<p>In the course of their Italian wanderings they reached Florence,
where they were so comfortable and well that they decided to engage a
villa for the next winter. Through Prof. Willard Fiske, they discovered
the Villa Viviani, near Settignano, an old palace beautifully located on
the hilltops east of Florence, commanding a wonderful view of the
ancient city. Clemens felt that he could work there, and time proved
that he was right.</p>
<p>For the summer, however, they returned to Germany, and located at
Bad-Nauheim. Clemens presently decided to make a trip to America to give
some personal attention to business matters. For one thing, his
publishing-house, in spite of prosperity, seemed constantly to be
requiring more capital, and then a Chicago company had been persuaded by
Paige to undertake the manufacture of the type-setter. It was the
beginning of a series of feverish trips which he would make back and
forth across the ocean during the next two years.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>BAD-NAUHEIM, June 11, ’92. Saturday. DEAR MR. HALL,–If this arrives
before I do, let it inform you that I am leaving Bremen for New York
next Tuesday in the “Havel.“</p>
<p>If you can meet me when the ship arrives, you can help me to get away
from the reporters; and maybe you can take me to your own or some other
lodgings where they can’t find me.</p>
<p>But if the hour is too early or too late for you, I shall obscure
myself somewhere till I can come to the office.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely S. L. C.</p>
<p>Nothing of importance happened in America. The new Paige company had
a factory started in Chicago and expected to manufacture fifty machines
as a beginning. They claimed to have capital, or to be able to command
it, and as the main control had passed from Clemens’s hands, he could do
no more than look over the ground and hope for the best. As for the
business, about all that he could do was to sign certain notes necessary
to provide such additional capital as was needed, and agree with Hall
that hereafter they would concentrate their efforts and resist further
temptation in the way of new enterprise. Then he returned to Bad-Nauheim
and settled down to literature. This was the middle of July, and he must
have worked pretty steadily, for he presently had a variety of MSS.
ready to offer.</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>Aug. 10, ’92. DEAR MR. HALT,–I have dropped that novel I wrote you
about, because I saw a more effective way of using the main episode–to
wit: by telling it through the lips of Huck Finn. So I have started Huck
Finn and Tom Sawyer (still 15 years old) and their friend the freed
slave Jim around the world in a stray balloon, with Huck as narrator,
and somewhere after the end of that great voyage he will work in the
said episode and then nobody will suspect that a whole book has been
written and the globe circumnavigated merely to get that episode in an
effective (and at the same time apparently unintentional) way. I have
written 12,000 words of this narrative, and find that the humor flows as
easily as the adventures and surprises–so I shall go along and make a
book of from 50,000 to 100,000 words.</p>
<p>It is a story for boys, of course, and I think will interest any boy
between 8 years and 80.</p>
<p>When I was in New York the other day Mrs. Dodge, editor of
St. Nicholas, wrote and, offered me ,000 for (serial right) a story for
boys 50,000 words long. I wrote back and declined, for I had other
matter in my mind, then.</p>
<p>I conceive that the right way to write a story for boys is to write
so that it will not only interest boys but will also strongly interest
any man who has ever been a boy. That immensely enlarges the
audience.</p>
<p>Now this story doesn’t need to be restricted to a Childs magazine–it
is proper enough for any magazine, I should think, or for a syndicate. I
don’t swear it, but I think so.</p>
<p>Proposed title of the story, “New Adventures of Huckleberry
Finn.“</p>
<p>[No signature.]</p>
<p>The “novel“ mentioned in the foregoing was The Extraordinary Twins, a
story from which Pudd’nhead Wilson would be evolved later. It was a
wildly extravagant farce–just the sort of thing that now and then Mark
Twain plunged into with an enthusiasm that had to work itself out and
die a natural death, or mellow into something worth while. Tom Sawyer
Abroad, as the new Huck story was finally called, was completed and
disposed of to St. Nicholas for serial publication.</p>
<p>The Twichells were in Europe that summer, and came to Bad-Nauheim.
The next letter records a pleasant incident. The Prince of Wales of that
day later became King Edward VII.</p>
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Orion Clemens, in Keokuk, Iowa.:</p>
<p>Private. BAD-NAUHEIM, Aug. 23, ’92. DEAR ORION AND MOLLIE,–(“Private“
because no newspaper-man or other gossip must get hold of it)</p>
<p>Livy is getting along pretty well, and the doctor thinks another
summer here will cure her.</p>
<p>The Twichell’s have been here four days and we have had good times
with them. Joe and I ran over to Homburg, the great pleasure resort,
Saturday, to dine with some friends, and in the morning I went walking
in the promenade and met the British Ambassador to the Court of Berlin,
and he introduced me to the Prince of Wales, and I found him a most
unusually comfortable and unembarrassing Englishman to talk with–quick
to see the obscurest point, and equipped with a laugh which is
spontaneous and catching. Am invited by a near friend of his to meet him
at dinner day after tomorrow, and there could be a good time, but the
brass band will smash the talk and spoil everything.</p>
<p>We are expecting to move to Florence ten or twelve days hence, but if
this hot weather continues we shall wait for cooler. I take Clara to
Berlin for the winter-music, mainly, with German and French added. Thus
far, Jean is our only glib French scholar.</p>
<p>We all send love to you all and to Pamela and Sam’s family, and
Annie.</p>
<p>SAM</p>
<p>Clemens and family left Bad-Nauheim for Italy by way of Switzerland.
In September Mrs. Clemens’s sister, Mrs. Crane, who had been with them
in Europe during the first year, had now returned to America.
Mrs. Clemens had improved at the baths, though she had by no means
recovered her health. We get a general report of conditions from the
letter which Clemens wrote Mrs. Crane from Lucerne, Switzerland, where
the party rested for several days. The “Phelps“ mentioned in this letter
was William Walter Phelps, United States Minister to Germany. The Phelps
and Clemens families had been much associated in Berlin. “Mason“ was
Frank Mason, Consul General at Frankfort, and in later years at Paris.
“Charlie and Ida“ were Charles and Mrs. Langdon, of Elmira.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Crane, in Elmira, N. Y.:</p>
<p>LUCERNE, Sept. 18, ’92. DEAR AUNT SUE,–Imagine how I felt to find
that you had actually gone off without filling my traveling ink stand
which you gave me! I found it out yesterday. Livy advised me to write
you about it.</p>
<p>I have been driving this pen hard. I wrote 280 pages on a yarn called
“Tom Sawyer Abroad,“ then took up the “Twins“ again, destroyed the last
half of the manuscript and re-wrote it in another form, and am going to
continue it and finish it in Florence. “Tom Sawyer“ seems rather pale to
the family after the extravagances of the Twins, but they came to like
it after they got used to it.</p>
<p>We remained in Nauheim a little too long. If we had left there four
or five days earlier we should have made Florence in 3 days; but by the
time we got started Livy had got smitten with what we feared might be
erysipelas–greatly swollen neck and face, and unceasing headaches. We
lay idle in Frankfort 4 days, doctoring. We started Thursday and made
Bale. Hard trip, because it was one of those trains that gets tired
every seven minutes and stops to rest three quarters of an hour. It took
us 3 1/2 hours to get here, instead of the regulation 2.20. We reached
here Friday evening and will leave tomorrow (Tuesday) morning. The rest
has made the headaches better. We shall pull through to Milan tomorrow
if possible. Next day we shall start at 10 a. m., and try to make
Bologna, 5 hours. Next day (Thursday) Florence, D. V. Next year we will
walk, for these excursions have got to be made over again. I’ve got
seven trunks, and I undertook to be courier because I meant to express
them to Florence direct, but we were a couple of days too late. All
continental roads had issued a peremptory order that no baggage should
travel a mile except in the company of the owner. (All over Europe
people are howling; they are separated from their baggage and can’t get
it forwarded to them) I have to re-ship my trunks every day. It is very
amusing–uncommonly so. There seemed grave doubts about our being able to
get these trunks over the Italian frontier, but I’ve got a very handsome
note from the Frankfort Italian Consul General addressed to all Italian
Customs Officers, and we shall get through if anybody does.</p>
<p>The Phelpses came to Frankfort and we had some great times–dinner at
his hotel, the Masons, supper at our inn–Livy not in it. She was merely
allowed a glimpse, no more. Of course, Phelps said she was merely
pretending to be ill; was never looking so well and fine.</p>
<p>The children are all right. They paddle around a little, and drive-so
do we all. Lucerne seems to be pretty full of tourists. The Fleulen boat
went out crowded yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The Paris Herald has created a public interest by inoculating one of
its correspondents with cholera. A man said yesterday he wished to God
they would inoculate all of them. Yes, the interest is quite general and
strong, and much hope is felt.</p>
<p>Livy says, I have said enough bad things, and better send all our
loves to you and Charley and Ida and all the children and shut up. Which
I do –and shut up. S. L. C.</p>
<p>They reached Florence on the 26th, and four days later we find
Clemens writing again to Mrs. Crane, detailing everything at length.
Little comment on this letter is required; it fully explains itself.
Perhaps a word of description from one of his memoranda will not be out
of place. Of the villa he wrote: “It is a plain, square building, like a
box, and is painted light green and has green window-shutters. It stands
in a commanding position on the artificial terrace of liberal
dimensions, which is walled around with masonry. From the walls the
vineyards and olive groves of the estate slant away toward the valley….
Roses overflow the retaining walls and the battered and mossy stone urn
on the gate-post, in pink and yellow cataracts, exactly as they do on
the drop-curtains in the theaters. The house is a very fortress for
strength.“</p>
<p>The Mrs. Ross in this letter was Janet Ross, daughter of Lady Duff
Gordon, remembered to-day for her Egyptian letters. The Ross castle was
but a little distance away.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Crane, in Elmira:</p>
<p>VILLA VIVIANI, SETTIGNANO, FLORENCE. Sept. 30, 1892 DEAR SUE,–We have
been in the house several days, and certainly it is a beautiful
place,–particularly at this moment, when the skies are a deep leaden
color, the domes of Florence dim in the drizzling rain, and occasional
perpendicular coils of lightning quivering intensely in the black sky
about Galileo’s Tower. It is a charming panorama, and the most
conspicuous towers and domes down in the city look to-day just as they
looked when Boccaccio and Dante used to contemplate them from this
hillock five and six hundred years ago.</p>
<p>The Mademoiselle is a great help to Livy in the housekeeping, and is
a cheery and cheerful presence in the house. The butler is equipped with
a little French, and it is this fact that enables the house to go–but it
won’t go well until the family get some sort of facility with the
Italian tongue, for the cook, the woman-of-all-work and the coachman
understand only that. It is a stubborn and devilish language to learn,
but Jean and the others will master it. Livy’s German Nauheim girl is
the worst off of anybody, as there is no market for her tongue at all
among the help.</p>
<p>With the furniture in and the curtains up the house is very pretty,
and not unhomelike. At mid-night last night we heard screams up
stairs–Susy had set the lofty window curtains afire with a candle. This
sounds kind of frightful, whereas when you come to think of it, a
burning curtain or pile of furniture hasn’t any element of danger about
it in this fortress. There isn’t any conceivable way to burn this house
down, or enable a conflagration on one floor to climb to the next.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ross laid in our wood, wine and servants for us, and they are
excellent. She had the house scoured from Cellar to rook the curtains
washed and put up, all beds pulled to pieces, beaten, washed and put
together again, and beguiled the Marchese into putting a big porcelain
stove in the vast central hall. She is a wonderful woman, and we don’t
quite see how or when we should have gotten under way without her.</p>
<p>Observe our address above–the post delivers letters daily at the
house.</p>
<p>Even with the work and fuss of settling the house Livy has
improved–and the best is yet to come. There is going to be absolute
seclusion here –a hermit life, in fact. We (the rest of us) shall run
over to the Ross’s frequently, and they will come here now and then and
see Livy –that is all. Mr. Fiske is away–nobody knows where–and the work
on his house has been stopped and his servants discharged. Therefore we
shall merely go Rossing–as far as society is concerned–shan’t circulate
in Florence until Livy shall be well enough to take a share in it.</p>
<p>This present house is modern. It is not much more than two centuries
old; but parts of it, and also its foundations are of high antiquity.
The fine beautiful family portraits–the great carved ones in the large
ovals over the doors of the big hall–carry one well back into the past.
One of them is dated 1305–he could have known Dante, you see. Another is
dated 1343–he could have known Boccaccio and spent his afternoons in
Fiesole listening to the Decameron tales. Another is dated 1463 –he
could have met Columbus…..</p>
<p>Evening. The storm thundered away until night, and the rain came down
in floods. For awhile there was a partial break, which furnished about
such a sunset as will be exhibited when the Last Day comes and the
universe tumbles together in wreck and ruin. I have never seen anything
more spectacular and impressive.</p>
<p>One person is satisfied with the villa, anyway. Jean prefers it to
all Europe, save Venice. Jean is eager to get at the Italian tongue
again, now, and I see that she has forgotten little or nothing of what
she learned of it in Rome and Venice last spring.</p>
<p>I am the head French duffer of the family. Most of the talk goes over
my head at the table. I catch only words, not phrases. When Italian
comes to be substituted I shall be even worse off than I am now, I
suppose.</p>
<p>This reminds me that this evening the German girl said to Livy, “Man
hat mir gesagt loss Sie una candella verlaught habe“–unconsciously
dropping in a couple of Italian words, you see. So she is going to join
the polyglots, too, it appears. They say it is good entertainment to
hear her and the butler talk together in their respective tongues,
piecing out and patching up with the universal sign-language as they go
along. Five languages in use in the house (including the
sign-language-hardest-worked of them all) and yet with all this opulence
of resource we do seem to have an uncommonly tough time making ourselves
understood.</p>
<p>What we lack is a cat. If we only had Germania! That was the most
satisfactory all-round cat I have seen yet. Totally ungermanic in the
raciness of his character and in the sparkle of his mind and the
spontaneity of his movements. We shall not look upon his like
again….</p>

<p>Clemens got well settled down to work presently. He found the
situation, the climate, the background, entirely suited to literary
production, and in a little while he had accomplished more than at any
other time since his arrival in Europe. From letters to Mrs. Crane and
to Mr. Hall we learn something of his employments and his
satisfaction.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Crane, in Elmira:</p>
<p>VILLA VIVIANI SETTIGNANO, FLORENCE. Oct. 22, ’92. DEAR SUE,–We are
getting wonted. The open fires have driven away the cold and the doubt,
and now a cheery spirit pervades the place. Livy and the Kings and
Mademoiselle having been taking their tea a number of times, lately, on
the open terrace with the city and the hills and the sunset for company.
I stop work, a few minutes, as a rule, when the sun gets down to the
hilltops west of Florence, and join the tea-group to wonder and exclaim.
There is always some new miracle in the view, a new and exquisite
variation in the show, a variation which occurs every 15 minutes between
dawn and night. Once early in the morning, a multitude of white villas
not before perceived, revealed themselves on the far hills; then we
recognized that all those great hills are snowed thick with them, clear
to the summit.</p>
<p>The variety of lovely effects, the infinitude of change, is something
not to be believed by any who has not seen it. No view that I am
acquainted with in the world is at all comparable to this for delicacy,
charm, exquisiteness, dainty coloring, and bewildering rapidity of
change. It keeps a person drunk with pleasure all the time. Sometimes
Florence ceases to be substantial, and becomes just a faint soft dream,
with domes and towers of air, and one is persuaded that he might blow it
away with a puff of his breath.</p>
<p>Livy is progressing admirably. This is just the place for her.</p>
<p>[Remainder missing.]</p>
<p>To Fred J. Hall, in New York:</p>
<p>Dec. 12, ’92. DEAR MR. HALL,–November check received.</p>
<p>I have lent the Californian’s Story to Arthur Stedman for his Author
Club Book, so your suggestion that my new spring-book bear that name
arrives too late, as he probably would not want us to use that story in
a book of ours until the Author book had had its run. That is for him to
decide –and I don’t want him hampered at all in his decision. I, for my
part, prefer the “,000,000 Banknote and Other Stories“ by Mark Twain as
a title, but above my judgment I prefer yours. I mean this–it is not
taffy.</p>
<p>I told Arthur to leave out the former squib or paragraph and use only
the Californian’s Story. Tell him this is because I am going to use that
in the book I am now writing.</p>
<p>I finished “Those Extraordinary Twins“ night before last makes 60 or
80,000 words–haven’t counted.</p>
<p>The last third of it suits me to a dot. I begin, to-day, to entirely
recast and re-write the first two-thirds–new plan, with two minor
characters, made very prominent, one major character cropped out, and
the Twins subordinated to a minor but not insignificant place.</p>
<p>The minor character will now become the chiefest, and I will name the
story after him–“Puddn’head Wilson.“</p>
<p>Merry Xmas to you, and great prosperity and felicity!</p>
<p>S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
