<h4 id="dan-murphy">DAN MURPHY</h4>
<p>One of the saddest things that ever came under my notice (said the
banker’s clerk) was there in Corning, during the war. Dan Murphy
enlisted as a private, and fought very bravely. The boys all liked him,
and when a wound by and by weakened him down till carrying a musket was
too heavy work for him, they clubbed together and fixed him up as a
sutler. He made money then, and sent it always to his wife to bank for
him. She was a washer and ironer, and knew enough by hard experience to
keep money when she got it. She didn’t waste a penny. On the contrary,
she began to get miserly as her bank account grew. She grieved to part
with a cent, poor creature, for twice in her hard-working life she had
known what it was to be hungry, cold, friendless, sick, and without a
dollar in the world, and she had a haunting dread of suffering so again.
Well, at last Dan died; and the boys, in testimony of their esteem and
respect for him, telegraphed to Mrs. Murphy to know if she would like to
have him embalmed and sent home, when you know the usual custom was to
dump a poor devil like him into a shallow hole, and then inform his
friends what had become of him. Mrs. Murphy jumped to the conclusion
that it would only cost two or three dollars to embalm her dead husband,
and so she telegraphed “Yes.“ It was at the “wake“ that the bill for
embalming arrived and was presented to the widow. She uttered a wild,
sad wail, that pierced every heart, and said: “Sivinty-foive dollars for
stoofhn’ Dan, blister their sowls! Did thim divils suppose I was goin’
to stairt a Museim, that I’d be dalin’ in such expinsive
curiassities!“</p>
<p>The banker’s clerk said there was not a dry eye in the house.</p>
<p>THE “TOURNAMENT“ IN A. D. 1870</p>
<p>Lately there appeared an item to this effect, and the same went the
customary universal round of the press:</p>
<p>A telegraph station has just been established upon the traditional
site of the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>As a companion to that, nothing fits so aptly and so perfectly as
this:</p>
<p>Brooklyn has revived the knightly tournament of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell which is the most startling, the idea of that
highest achievement of human genius and intelligence, the telegraph,
prating away about the practical concerns of the world’s daily life in
the heart and home of ancient indolence, ignorance, and savagery, or the
idea of that happiest expression of the brag, vanity, and mock-heroics
of our ancestors, the “tournament,“ coming out of its grave to flaunt
its tinsel trumpery and perform its “chivalrous“ absurdities in the high
noon of the nineteenth century, and under the patronage of a great,
broad-awake city and an advanced civilisation.</p>
<p>A “tournament“ in Lynchburg is a thing easily within the
comprehension of the average mind; but no commonly gifted person can
conceive of such a spectacle in Brooklyn without straining his powers.
Brooklyn is part and parcel of the city of New York, and there is hardly
romance enough in the entire metropolis to re-supply a Virginia “knight“
with “chivalry,“ in case he happened to run out of it. Let the reader
calmly and dispassionately picture to himself “lists“ in Brooklyn;
heralds, pursuivants, pages, garter king-at-arms–in Brooklyn; the
marshalling of the fantastic hosts of “chivalry“ in slashed doublets,
velvet trunks, ruffles, and plumes–in Brooklyn; mounted on omnibus and
livery-stable patriarchs, promoted, and referred to in cold blood as
“steeds,“ “destriers,“ and “chargers,“ and divested of their friendly,
humble names these meek old “Jims“ and “Bobs“ and “Charleys,“ and
renamed “Mohammed,“ “Bucephalus,“ and “Saladin“–in Brooklyn; mounted
thus, and armed with swords and shields and wooden lances, and cased in
paste board hauberks, morions, greaves, and gauntlets, and addressed as
“Sir“ Smith, and “Sir“ Jones, and bearing such titled grandeurs as “The
Disinherited Knight,“ the “Knight of Shenandoah,“ the “Knight of the
Blue Ridge,“ the “Knight of Maryland,“ and the “Knight of the Secret
Sorrow“–in Brooklyn; and at the toot of the horn charging fiercely upon
a helpless ring hung on a post, and prodding at it in trepidly with
their wooden sticks, and by and by skewering it and cavorting back to
the judges’ stand covered with glory this in Brooklyn; and each noble
success like this duly and promptly announced by an applauding toot from
the herald’s horn, and “the band playing three bars of an old circus
tune“–all in Brooklyn, in broad daylight. And let the reader remember,
and also add to his picture, as follows, to wit: when the show was all
over, the party who had shed the most blood and overturned and hacked to
pieces the most knights, or at least had prodded the most muffin-rings,
was accorded the ancient privilege of naming and crowning the Queen of
Love and Beauty–which naming had in reality been done for, him by the
“cut-and-dried“ process, and long in advance, by a committee of ladies,
but the crowning he did in person, though suffering from loss of blood,
and then was taken to the county hospital on a shutter to have his
wounds dressed–these curious things all occurring in Brooklyn, and no
longer ago than one or two yesterdays. It seems impossible, and yet it
is true.</p>
<p>This was doubtless the first appearance of the “tournament“ up here
among the rolling-mills and factories, and will probably be the last. It
will be well to let it retire permanently to the rural districts of
Virginia, where, it is said, the fine mailed and plumed, noble-natured,
maiden-rescuing, wrong-redressing, adventure-seeking knight of romance
is accepted and believed in by the peasantry with pleasing simplicity,
while they reject with scorn the plain, unpolished verdict whereby
history exposes him as a braggart, a ruffian, a fantastic vagabond; and
an ignoramus.</p>
<p>All romance aside, what shape would our admiration of the heroes of
Ashby de la Zouch be likely to take, in this practical age, if those
worthies were to rise up and come here and perform again the chivalrous
deeds of that famous passage of arms? Nothing but a New York jury and
the insanity plea could save them from hanging, from the amiable
Bois-Guilbert and the pleasant Front-de-Boeuf clear down to the nameless
ruffians that entered the riot with unpictured shields and did their
first murder and acquired their first claim to respect that day. The
doings of the so-called “chivalry“ of the Middle Ages were absurd
enough, even when they were brutally and bloodily in earnest, and when
their surroundings of castles and donjons, savage landscapes and
half-savage peoples, were in keeping; but those doings gravely
reproduced with tinsel decorations and mock pageantry, by bucolic
gentlemen with broomstick lances, and with muffin-rings to represent the
foe, and all in the midst of the refinement and dignity of a
carefully-developed modern civilisation, is absurdity gone crazy.</p>
<p>Now, for next exhibition, let us have a fine representation of one of
those chivalrous wholesale butcheries and burnings of Jewish women and
children, which the crusading heroes of romance used to indulge in in
their European homes, just before starting to the Holy Land, to seize
and take to their protection the Sepulchre and defend it from
“pollution.“</p>
