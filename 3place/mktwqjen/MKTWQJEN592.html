<h4 id="chapter-ii.">CHAPTER II.</h4>
<p>ANGELO IS BLUE</p>
<p>[After breakfast the whole village crowded in, and there was a grand
reception in honor of the twins; and at the close of it the gifted
“freak“ captured everybody’s admiration by sitting down at the piano and
knocking out a classic four-handed piece in great style. Then the judge
took it–or them–driving in his buggy and showed off his village.]</p>
<p>All along the streets the people crowded the windows and stared at
the amazing twins. Troops of small boys flocked after the buggy, excited
and yelling. At first the dogs showed no interest. They thought they
merely saw three men in a buggy–a matter of no consequence; but when
they found out the facts of the case, they altered their opinion pretty
radically, and joined the boys, expressing their minds as they came.
Other dogs got interested; indeed, all the dogs. It was a spirited sight
to see them come leaping fences, tearing around corners, swarming out of
every bystreet and alley. The noise they made was something beyond
belief –or praise. They did not seem to be moved by malice but only by
prejudice, the common human prejudice against lack of conformity. If the
twins turned their heads, they broke and fled in every direction, but
stopped at a safe distance and faced about; and then formed and came on
again as soon as the strangers showed them their back. Negroes and
farmers’ wives took to the woods when the buggy came upon them suddenly,
and altogether the drive was pleasant and animated, and a refreshment
all around.</p>
<p>[It was a long and lively drive. Angelo was a Methodist, Luigi was a
Free-thinker. The judge was very proud of his Freethinkers’ Society,
which was flourishing along in a most prosperous way and already had two
members–himself and the obscure and neglected Pudd’nhead Wilson. It was
to meet that evening, and he invited Luigi to join; a thing which Luigi
was glad to do, partly because it would please himself, and partly
because it would gravel Angelo.]</p>
<p>They had now arrived at the widow’s gate, and the excursion was
ended. The twins politely expressed their obligations for the pleasant
outing which had been afforded them; to which the judge bowed his
thanks, and then said he would now go and arrange for the Free-thinkers’
meeting, and would call for Count Luigi in the evening.</p>
<p>“For you also, dear sir,“ he added hastily, turning to Angelo and
bowing. “In addressing myself particularly to your brother, I was not
meaning to leave you out. It was an unintentional rudeness, I assure
you, and due wholly to accident–accident and preoccupation. I beg you to
forgive me.“</p>
<p>His quick eye had seen the sensitive blood mount into Angelo’s face,
betraying the wound that had been inflicted. The sting of the slight had
gone deep, but the apology was so prompt, and so evidently sincere, that
the hurt was almost immediately healed, and a forgiving smile testified
to the kindly judge that all was well again.</p>
<p>Concealed behind Angelo’s modest and unassuming exterior, and
unsuspected by any but his intimates, was a lofty pride, a pride of
almost abnormal proportions, indeed, and this rendered him ever the prey
of slights; and although they were almost always imaginary ones, they
hurt none the less on that account. By ill fortune judge Driscoll had
happened to touch his sorest point, i.e., his conviction that his
brother’s presence was welcomer everywhere than his own; that he was
often invited, out of mere courtesy, where only his brother was wanted,
and that in a majority of cases he would not be included in an
invitation if he could be left out without offense. A sensitive nature
like this is necessarily subject to moods; moods which traverse the
whole gamut of feeling; moods which know all the climes of emotion, from
the sunny heights of joy to the black abysses of despair. At times, in
his seasons of deepest depressions, Angelo almost wished that he and his
brother might become segregated from each other and be separate
individuals, like other men. But of course as soon as his mind cleared
and these diseased imaginings passed away, he shuddered at the repulsive
thought, and earnestly prayed that it might visit him no more. To be
separate, and as other men are! How awkward it would seem; how
unendurable. What would he do with his hands, his arms? How would his
legs feel? How odd, and strange, and grotesque every action, attitude,
movement, gesture would be. To sleep by himself, eat by himself, walk by
himself–how lonely, how unspeakably lonely! No, no, any fate but that.
In every way and from every point, the idea was revolting.</p>
<p>This was of course natural; to have felt otherwise would have been
unnatural. He had known no life but a combined one; he had been familiar
with it from his birth; he was not able to conceive of any other as
being agreeable, or even bearable. To him, in the privacy of his secret
thoughts, all other men were monsters, deformities: and during
three-fourths of his life their aspect had filled him with what promised
to be an unconquerable aversion. But at eighteen his eye began to take
note of female beauty; and little by little, undefined longings grew up
in his heart, under whose softening influences the old stubborn aversion
gradually diminished, and finally disappeared. Men were still
monstrosities to him, still deformities, and in his sober moments he had
no desire to be like them, but their strange and unsocial and uncanny
construction was no longer offensive to him.</p>
<p>This had been a hard day for him, physically and mentally. He had
been called in the morning before he had quite slept off the effects of
the liquor which Luigi had drunk; and so, for the first half-hour had
had the seedy feeling, and languor, the brooding depression, the
cobwebby mouth and druggy taste that come of dissipation and are so ill
a preparation for bodily or intellectual activities; the long violent
strain of the reception had followed; and this had been followed, in
turn, by the dreary sight-seeing, the judge’s wearying explanations and
laudations of the sights, and the stupefying clamor of the dogs. As a
congruous conclusion, a fitting end, his feelings had been hurt, a
slight had been put upon him. He would have been glad to forego dinner
and betake himself to rest and sleep, but he held his peace and said no
word, for he knew his brother, Luigi, was fresh, unweary, full of life,
spirit, energy; he would have scoffed at the idea of wasting valuable
time on a bed or a sofa, and would have refused permission.</p>
