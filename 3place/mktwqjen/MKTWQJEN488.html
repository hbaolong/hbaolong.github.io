<h4 id="chapter-i.">CHAPTER I.</h4>
<p>SIR DINADAN THE HUMORIST</p>
<p>It seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully
told; but then I had heard it only once, and that makes a difference; it
was pleasant to the others when it was fresh, no doubt.</p>
<p>Sir Dinadan the Humorist was the first to awake, and he soon roused
the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality. He tied
some metal mugs to a dog’s tail and turned him loose, and he tore around
and around the place in a frenzy of fright, with all the other dogs
bellowing after him and battering and crashing against everything that
came in their way and making altogether a chaos of confusion and a most
deafening din and turmoil; at which every man and woman of the multitude
laughed till the tears flowed, and some fell out of their chairs and
wallowed on the floor in ecstasy. It was just like so many children. Sir
Dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep from telling
over and over again, to weariness, how the immortal idea happened to
occur to him; and as is the way with humorists of his breed, he was
still laughing at it after everybody else had got through. He was so set
up that he concluded to make a speech –of course a humorous speech. I
think I never heard so many old played-out jokes strung together in my
life. He was worse than the minstrels, worse than the clown in the
circus. It seemed peculiarly sad to sit here, thirteen hundred years
before I was born, and listen again to poor, flat, worm-eaten jokes that
had given me the dry gripes when I was a boy thirteen hundred years
afterwards. It about convinced me that there isn’t any such thing as a
new joke possible. Everybody laughed at these antiquities –but then they
always do; I had noticed that, centuries later. However, of course the
scoffer didn’t laugh–I mean the boy. No, he scoffed; there wasn’t
anything he wouldn’t scoff at. He said the most of Sir Dinadan’s jokes
were rotten and the rest were petrified. I said “petrified“ was good; as
I believed, myself, that the only right way to classify the majestic
ages of some of those jokes was by geologic periods. But that neat idea
hit the boy in a blank place, for geology hadn’t been invented yet.
However, I made a note of the remark, and calculated to educate the
commonwealth up to it if I pulled through. It is no use to throw a good
thing away merely because the market isn’t ripe yet.</p>
<p>Now Sir Kay arose and began to fire up on his history-mill with me
for fuel. It was time for me to feel serious, and I did. Sir Kay told
how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians, who all wore the
same ridiculous garb that I did–a garb that was a work of enchantment,
and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt by human hands. However
he had nullified the force of the enchantment by prayer, and had killed
my thirteen knights in a three hours’ battle, and taken me prisoner,
sparing my life in order that so strange a curiosity as I was might be
exhibited to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court. He
spoke of me all the time, in the blandest way, as “this prodigious
giant,“ and “this horrible sky-towering monster,“ and “this tusked and
taloned man-devouring ogre“, and everybody took in all this bosh in the
naivest way, and never smiled or seemed to notice that there was any
discrepancy between these watered statistics and me. He said that in
trying to escape from him I sprang into the top of a tree two hundred
cubits high at a single bound, but he dislodged me with a stone the size
of a cow, which “all-to brast“ the most of my bones, and then swore me
to appear at Arthur’s court for sentence. He ended by condemning me to
die at noon on the 21st; and was so little concerned about it that he
stopped to yawn before he named the date.</p>
<p>I was in a dismal state by this time; indeed, I was hardly enough in
my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as to how I
had better be killed, the possibility of the killing being doubted by
some, because of the enchantment in my clothes. And yet it was nothing
but an ordinary suit of fifteen-dollar slop-shops. Still, I was sane
enough to notice this detail, to wit: many of the terms used in the most
matter-of-fact way by this great assemblage of the first ladies and
gentlemen in the land would have made a Comanche blush. Indelicacy is
too mild a term to convey the idea. However, I had read “Tom Jones,“ and
“Roderick Random,“ and other books of that kind, and knew that the
highest and first ladies and gentlemen in England had remained little or
no cleaner in their talk, and in the morals and conduct which such talk
implies, clear up to a hundred years ago; in fact clear into our own
nineteenth century–in which century, broadly speaking, the earliest
samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable in English
history–or in European history, for that matter–may be said to have made
their appearance. Suppose Sir Walter, instead of putting the
conversations into the mouths of his characters, had allowed the
characters to speak for themselves? We should have had talk from Rebecca
and Ivanhoe and the soft lady Rowena which would embarrass a tramp in
our day. However, to the unconsciously indelicate all things are
delicate. King Arthur’s people were not aware that they were indecent
and I had presence of mind enough not to mention it.</p>
<p>They were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were
mightily relieved, at last, when old Merlin swept the difficulty away
for them with a common-sense hint. He asked them why they were so
dull–why didn’t it occur to them to strip me. In half a minute I was as
naked as a pair of tongs! And dear, dear, to think of it: I was the only
embarrassed person there. Everybody discussed me; and did it as
unconcernedly as if I had been a cabbage. Queen Guenever was as naively
interested as the rest, and said she had never seen anybody with legs
just like mine before. It was the only compliment I got–if it was a
compliment.</p>
<p>Finally I was carried off in one direction, and my perilous clothes
in another. I was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon, with
some scant remnants for dinner, some moldy straw for a bed, and no end
of rats for company.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>AN INSPIRATION</p>
<p>I was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake
long.</p>
<p>When I next came to myself, I seemed to have been asleep a very long
time. My first thought was, “Well, what an astonishing dream I’ve had! I
reckon I’ve waked only just in time to keep from being hanged or drowned
or burned or something…. I’ll nap again till the whistle blows, and then
I’ll go down to the arms factory and have it out with Hercules.“</p>
<p>But just then I heard the harsh music of rusty chains and bolts, a
light flashed in my eyes, and that butterfly, Clarence, stood before me!
I gasped with surprise; my breath almost got away from me.</p>
<p>“What!“ I said, “you here yet? Go along with the rest of the dream!
scatter!“</p>
<p>But he only laughed, in his light-hearted way, and fell to making fun
of my sorry plight.</p>
<p>“All right,“ I said resignedly, “let the dream go on; I’m in no
hurry.“</p>
<p>“Prithee what dream?“</p>
<p>“What dream? Why, the dream that I am in Arthur’s court–a person who
never existed; and that I am talking to you, who are nothing but a work
of the imagination.“</p>
<p>“Oh, la, indeed! and is it a dream that you’re to be burned
to-morrow? Ho-ho–answer me that!“</p>
<p>The shock that went through me was distressing. I now began to reason
that my situation was in the last degree serious, dream or no dream; for
I knew by past experience of the lifelike intensity of dreams, that to
be burned to death, even in a dream, would be very far from being a
jest, and was a thing to be avoided, by any means, fair or foul, that I
could contrive. So I said beseechingly:</p>
<p>“Ah, Clarence, good boy, only friend I’ve got,–for you <em>are</em>
my friend, aren’t you?–don’t fail me; help me to devise some way of
escaping from this place!“</p>
<p>“Now do but hear thyself! Escape? Why, man, the corridors are in
guard and keep of men-at-arms.“</p>
<p>“No doubt, no doubt. But how many, Clarence? Not many, I hope?“</p>
<p>“Full a score. One may not hope to escape.“ After a pause
–hesitatingly: “and there be other reasons–and weightier.“</p>
<p>“Other ones? What are they?“</p>
<p>“Well, they say–oh, but I daren’t, indeed daren’t!“</p>
<p>“Why, poor lad, what is the matter? Why do you blench? Why do you
tremble so?“</p>
<p>“Oh, in sooth, there is need! I do want to tell you, but–“</p>
<p>“Come, come, be brave, be a man–speak out, there’s a good lad!“</p>
<p>He hesitated, pulled one way by desire, the other way by fear; then
he stole to the door and peeped out, listening; and finally crept close
to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his fearful news in a
whisper, and with all the cowering apprehension of one who was venturing
upon awful ground and speaking of things whose very mention might be
freighted with death.</p>
<p>“Merlin, in his malice, has woven a spell about this dungeon, and
there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate enough
to essay to cross its lines with you! Now God pity me, I have told it!
Ah, be kind to me, be merciful to a poor boy who means thee well; for an
thou betray me I am lost!“</p>
<p>I laughed the only really refreshing laugh I had had for some time;
and shouted:</p>
<p>“Merlin has wrought a spell! <em>Merlin</em>, forsooth! That cheap
old humbug, that maundering old ass? Bosh, pure bosh, the silliest bosh
in the world! Why, it does seem to me that of all the childish, idiotic,
chuckle-headed, chicken-livered superstitions that ev –oh, damn
Merlin!“</p>
<p>But Clarence had slumped to his knees before I had half finished, and
he was like to go out of his mind with fright.</p>
<p>“Oh, beware! These are awful words! Any moment these walls may
crumble upon us if you say such things. Oh call them back before it is
too late!“</p>
<p>Now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to
thinking. If everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely afraid
of Merlin’s pretended magic as Clarence was, certainly a superior man
like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive some way to take advantage
of such a state of things. I went on thinking, and worked out a plan.
Then I said:</p>
<p>“Get up. Pull yourself together; look me in the eye. Do you know why
I laughed?“</p>
<p>“No–but for our blessed Lady’s sake, do it no more.“</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll tell you why I laughed. Because I’m a magician
myself.“</p>
<p>“Thou!“ The boy recoiled a step, and caught his breath, for the thing
hit him rather sudden; but the aspect which he took on was very, very
respectful. I took quick note of that; it indicated that a humbug didn’t
need to have a reputation in this asylum; people stood ready to take him
at his word, without that. I resumed.</p>
<p>“I’ve know Merlin seven hundred years, and he–“</p>
<p>“Seven hun–“</p>
<p>“Don’t interrupt me. He has died and come alive again thirteen times,
and traveled under a new name every time: Smith, Jones, Robinson,
Jackson, Peters, Haskins, Merlin–a new alias every time he turns up. I
knew him in Egypt three hundred years ago; I knew him in India five
hundred years ago–he is always blethering around in my way, everywhere I
go; he makes me tired. He don’t amount to shucks, as a magician; knows
some of the old common tricks, but has never got beyond the rudiments,
and never will. He is well enough for the provinces–one-night stands and
that sort of thing, you know–but dear me, <em>he</em> oughtn’t to set up
for an expert–anyway not where there’s a real artist. Now look here,
Clarence, I am going to stand your friend, right along, and in return
you must be mine. I want you to do me a favor. I want you to get word to
the king that I am a magician myself–and the Supreme Grand
High-yu-Muck-amuck and head of the tribe, at that; and I want him to be
made to understand that I am just quietly arranging a little calamity
here that will make the fur fly in these realms if Sir Kay’s project is
carried out and any harm comes to me. Will you get that to the king for
me?“</p>
<p>The poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me. It
was pitiful to see a creature so terrified, so unnerved, so demoralized.
But he promised everything; and on my side he made me promise over and
over again that I would remain his friend, and never turn against him or
cast any enchantments upon him. Then he worked his way out, staying
himself with his hand along the wall, like a sick person.</p>
<p>Presently this thought occurred to me: how heedless I have been! When
the boy gets calm, he will wonder why a great magician like me should
have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place; he will put
this and that together, and will see that I am a humbug.</p>
<p>I worried over that heedless blunder for an hour, and called myself a
great many hard names, meantime. But finally it occurred to me all of a
sudden that these animals didn’t reason; that <em>they</em> never put
this and that together; that all their talk showed that they didn’t know
a discrepancy when they saw it. I was at rest, then.</p>
<p>But as soon as one is at rest, in this world, off he goes on
something else to worry about. It occurred to me that I had made another
blunder: I had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with a threat–I
intending to invent a calamity at my leisure; now the people who are the
readiest and eagerest and willingest to swallow miracles are the very
ones who are hungriest to see you perform them; suppose I should be
called on for a sample? Suppose I should be asked to name my calamity?
Yes, I had made a blunder; I ought to have invented my calamity first.
“What shall I do? what can I say, to gain a little time?“ I was in
trouble again; in the deepest kind of trouble…</p>
<p>“There’s a footstep!–they’re coming. If I had only just a moment to
think…. Good, I’ve got it. I’m all right.“</p>
<p>You see, it was the eclipse. It came into my mind in the nick of
time, how Columbus, or Cortez, or one of those people, played an eclipse
as a saving trump once, on some savages, and I saw my chance. I could
play it myself, now, and it wouldn’t be any plagiarism, either, because
I should get it in nearly a thousand years ahead of those parties.</p>
<p>Clarence came in, subdued, distressed, and said:</p>
<p>“I hasted the message to our liege the king, and straightway he had
me to his presence. He was frighted even to the marrow, and was minded
to give order for your instant enlargement, and that you be clothed in
fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so great; but then came Merlin
and spoiled all; for he persuaded the king that you are mad, and know
not whereof you speak; and said your threat is but foolishness and idle
vaporing. They disputed long, but in the end, Merlin, scoffing, said,
‘Wherefore hath he not <em>named</em> his brave calamity? Verily it is
because he cannot.’ This thrust did in a most sudden sort close the
king’s mouth, and he could offer naught to turn the argument; and so,
reluctant, and full loth to do you the discourtesy, he yet prayeth you
to consider his perplexed case, as noting how the matter stands, and
name the calamity–if so be you have determined the nature of it and the
time of its coming. Oh, prithee delay not; to delay at such a time were
to double and treble the perils that already compass thee about. Oh, be
thou wise–name the calamity!“</p>
<p>I allowed silence to accumulate while I got my impressiveness
together, and then said:</p>
<p>“How long have I been shut up in this hole?“</p>
<p>“Ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent. It is 9 of the
morning now.“</p>
<p>“No! Then I have slept well, sure enough. Nine in the morning now!
And yet it is the very complexion of midnight, to a shade. This is the
20th, then?“</p>
<p>“The 20th–yes.“</p>
<p>“And I am to be burned alive to-morrow.“ The boy shuddered.</p>
<p>“At what hour?“</p>
<p>“At high noon.“</p>
<p>“Now then, I will tell you what to say.“ I paused, and stood over
that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence; then, in a voice
deep, measured, charged with doom, I began, and rose by dramatically
graded stages to my colossal climax, which I delivered in as sublime and
noble a way as ever I did such a thing in my life: “Go back and tell the
king that at that hour I will smother the whole world in the dead
blackness of midnight; I will blot out the sun, and he shall never shine
again; the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack of light and warmth,
and the peoples of the earth shall famish and die, to the last man!“</p>
<p>I had to carry the boy out myself, he sunk into such a collapse. I
handed him over to the soldiers, and went back.</p>
