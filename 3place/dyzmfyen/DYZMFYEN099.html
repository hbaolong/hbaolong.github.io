<h4 id="corpus-based-results">7.1.1　Corpus-based Results</h4>
<p>In the corpus,I put the 15 selected films’ dual language subtitles;
the total number is 19,081 pairs,and the following table shows the
frequency of popular expressions that appeared in each of the 15
selected animation films:</p>
<p>Screenshot 15</p>
<p>(A sample calculation in ParaConc)</p>
<p>The above screenshot illustrates the way of calculating the frequency
of the use of popular expressions in the 15 selected films.Similar to
the method of calculating traditional expressions in the last chapter,I
gave the label “PE” (the abbreviation for popular expression) to each of
the translated subtitles which involve the use of popular
expressions,and then put them into a ParaConc,the frequency is
displayed.After getting all the data of the 15 selected films,I make the
following table to record all the data:</p>
<p>Table 8</p>
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>In the above figure,firstly,the film Rio 1 indicates the highest
frequency of using popular expressions in translation; however,the film
The Smurfs 1 shows the lowest frequency of using popular expressions
among the 15 selected films.Secondly,the films which have the top five
highest frequency of use of popular expressions in their translation
have three points in common: a) all of these films have over 1,200 pairs
of bilingual subtitles,except one with 954; b) all of these films used
popular translation expressions in about 29% of the total number of
translated subtitles; c) all of the films are relative newly released
films compared with the rest of the selected films.(The Smurfs 2 and
Turbo are from 2013; Madagascar 3 is from 2012; Rio 1,Alpha and Omega
are from 2011.)</p>
<p>The reasons for applying popular expressions may vary.I checked the
data of these films and finds that the original English subtitles are
commonly short and simple,so that there will be not much chance to use
these typical expressions in translation.However,when I select the
series of The Smurfs 1 and 2 to compare,I find that the frequency of
using popular expressions in The Smurfs 2 is dramatically increased.</p>
<p>Besides,the tendency of using popular expressions in English-Chinese
subtitle translation now exists in three series of released films
(including the above mentioned The Smurfs series) out of five in the 15
selected films as:</p>
<p>Table 9</p>
<p>Although the other two series of films Cars 1 and 2,Rio 1 and 2
showed the reverse situation,the difference value of the frequency
between them was very small,unlike that of the above three series of
films.In the above three series of films,the increasing tendency to use
popular expressions in subtitle translation has mostly shown a dramatic
increase; this closely reflects the other linguistic phenomena that have
appeared in recent years in China.With the development of the high-tech
informational media,particularly the Internet,Chinese people create more
and more popular expressions in modern Chinese,and widely use these
up-to-date expressions in their daily life.In these collected data,I
find that the use of this type of expression becomes more and more
frequent.In the five series of films,most of the series of films show
this tendency,considering the similar characters,story lines and
plots.The phenomenon of the increasing frequency of using popular
expressions can validate the research hypothesis in this study
concerning the extent to which the use of popular expressions in E-C
subtitle translation is effective.The online grades in the next section
to the series of films can also prove this point.Then,in the rest of
four films,Frozen,Alpha and Omega,The Croods and Turbo,there are three
out of four films that show a high frequency of using popular
expressions in their subtitle translation (around 30%); the common point
among them is all of these films are the recent three years’ released
films.Concurrently,in the past three years in China,people pay more and
more attention to the creation of popular language and prefer to use it
in daily life.They regard the use of this kind of language is a kind of
fashion and an easier way to communicate with young people.Therefore,the
increasing frequency of using popular language in subtitle translation
in English-language exported animation films in China can be seen as a
kind of attitude to shorten the distance between the film and its target
audience; it is,therefore,effective in arousing the audience’s interests
in these films.This high-frequency use of popular expressions in the
given data also highlights how the choices and preferences of the
subtitlers and subtitling companies of these films can keep up with
language development.</p>
<p>However,because the content of the narratives is different and the
number and type of screen characters is not same,it cannot necessarily
be argued that the more culturally loaded expressions (including
traditional ones and popular ones) are used,the more expressive and
multi-layered a film is.Nevertheless,to use evocative culturally loaded
expressions like popular ones wherever appropriate and possible in a
given animated film is surely the correct choice,because this language
has a stronger resonance for the audience,especially the young
audience,because this is the real language they use in daily
communication with their friends; these expressions echo what they have
regularly heard and used.This sort of language will elicit more of a
response from audiences than dryer,more literal and less evocative
translation approaches,a perspective reiterated by the responses of the
questionnaire respondents.</p>
<p>Taking into account that Rio 1 was the first film in an established
franchise and The Smurfs 1 was a relatively unknown quantity to Chinese
audiences,this does raise the question of how important the quality of
the translated language might be in influencing the acceptance of a film
in a foreign market,in particular the extent to which the use of
culturally loaded expressions (including the type of traditional
expressions discussed in last chapter) in E-C subtitling will affect the
popularity of the film.</p>
<p>However,some contradictory phenomena also appear in this graph.Frozen
received the highest approval rating from netizens,(on the basis of
information from the following three websites in next section);
however,the graph shows that its use of popular expressions is the
second lowest frequency.Considering other elements such as the
storyline,the film type (this is a musical film),the characters (the
main characters are two girls),it is arguable that the approval rating
by online voters will be influenced by these other elements as well.As
far as the subtitling is concerned,I evaluated the Chinese translated
subtitles,and there is rarely a problem or inaccuracy in them,the only
flaw being the repetitive Chinese phrasing in some places which makes
some of the subtitling unnecessarily long.Compared with the film Rio
1,the film which had the highest frequency of using popular
expressions,the story line of Frozen is relatively simple; as a musical
animated film,nearly every main character has one or two songs to
perform in the film.For some audience,frequent episodes may slightly
interference in the process of watching a film; Frozen has fewer main
characters than those in Rio 1.Furthermore,Rio 1 used popular
expressions in over 33% of its subtitles — the highest frequency out of
the films featuring this method in their subtitling — it did also occupy
first place in the ranking of films as evaluated by Internet users (see
the chart in the next section).Its ranking of the most popular film
suggests that the quality of the translated language in subtitles is an
inevitable criterion in evaluating a film; the quality of the translated
language does arguably affect the reception of a film.Regardless of a
film’s overall budget,if one of its individual components is
demonstrably weak compared with the others,then a viewer’s enjoyment of
the film will probably be compromised.Especially in translated films,if
the language component — the translated subtitles — are not good enough
with many translation mistakes or missed translations in many frames,the
popularity of this translated film must be influenced,because some of
the audience will not comprehend the film without getting enough
information from the translated subtitles.For the audience members who
have a certain level of English,it will be exasperating when they watch
the inappropriate translations.</p>
