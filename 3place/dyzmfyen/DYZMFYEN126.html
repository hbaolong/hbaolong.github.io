<p>1.Interview with Professor Huang Libo in April 2014 via email</p>
<p>Brief Introduction to the Interviewee</p>
<p>Professor Huang is based in the School of English of Xi’an
International Studies University.His main interest is the study of
corpus-based translation studies.</p>
<p>Interview Topic</p>
<p>How to collate an appropriate corpus for this research</p>
<p>Scholar’s Suggestions</p>
<p>Professor Huang’s reply mainly covers: 1) suggestion on attending a
relevant training course or workshop; 2) searching online in order to
find a useful corpus to be referenced by the researcher.</p>
<p>Transcription</p>
<p>Q = questions asked by the researcher; A = answers from Professor
Huang</p>
<p>Q: Dear Professor,I am happy to write this letter to you! I am a
first year PhD student in the University of Salford.I am now undertaking
research on the discussion of translated animation film subtitling.I
plan to use a corpus as the primary research tool in my research in
order to analyse the translation strategies and issues from a selection
of 15 animation films.I would like to ask for your advice on choosing a
proper type of corpus.Thank you very much for your help!</p>
<p>A: Dear Ms.Jin,thank you for your letter! Since you are just starting
your study,I recommend you to learn the main types of corpus in
translation studies first.Every year,in Beijing and Shanghai,there will
be relevant summer courses or training for learners.You may want to join
in one or two of these studies to gain a basic understanding of
corpus.You may also search online or buy access to the online library of
Beijing International Studies University to see their recent constructed
Chinese-English parallel corpus.This may give you some useful help.I
wish you good luck in your study!</p>
<p>2.Interview with Professor Liang Maocheng and Dr.Xu Jiajin,8 July
2014,Beijing,China</p>
<p>Brief Introduction to the Interviewees</p>
<p>Professor Liang Maocheng is a teacher,researcher and professor at
Beijing International Studies University.His study interests are corpus
linguistics,computer languages,second language acquisition and language
comparison.</p>
<p>Dr.Xu Jiajin is a researcher at the same university in Beijing,whose
study interests are applied linguistics,corpus linguistics and
corpusbased discourse construction.</p>
<p>Interview Topic</p>
<p>Suggestions that practical scholars in the field of corpus study can
offer to the researcher in order to construct a parallel corpus for this
specific study.</p>
<p>In order to seek an effective and innovative research methodology for
the current research,the researcher referenced relevant papers and books
on the study field of AVT and she found that the tendency within
translation studies research has been towards applying a corpus in
recent years.However,the use of this method in subtitle translation is
seldom.Then the researcher obtained permission from her supervisors to
attend a summer course on the topic of corpus in translation studies.On
this course,the researcher learned about different types of corpora and
got to know their different functions from the teaching of the two
famous scholars in the area of corpus study.Besides listening to the
course content,the research got the chance to interview the two scholars
in order to get suggestions on choosing the applicable type of corpus in
her specific research.</p>
<p>Scholars’ Suggestions</p>
<p>In the course of the conversation about how to construct a suitable
corpus for this specific study,the interviewees offered a great deal of
useful advice,which enabled the researcher to build up her own corpus in
a purposeful and focused way.The main elements of this advice were as
follows: firstly,they encouraged the researcher to seek practical input
from the Shanghai Translated Film Studio,the official company for
translating exported films into China; secondly,they recommended naming
this specific corpus as a “selfbuilt parallel corpus for a special
purpose”,in view of the usage and scale of the corpus; thirdly,in the
next phase of the research work,they encouraged the researcher to
continue inputting more data into the corpus in order to obtain more
effective and objective data results; lastly,they recommended
transforming the data results into value measurements with a practical
application to help real-world subtitlers produce subtitles of a more
effective and reliable quality.</p>
<p>Transcription</p>
<p>Q = questions asked by the researcher; A1 = answers from Professor
Liang; A2 = answers from Dr.Xu</p>
<p>Q1: Good afternoon,Professor Liang,Dr.Xu.Thank you for accepting this
interview.Could you please briefly introduce yourselves first?</p>
<p>A1: Good afternoon.Thank you for your invitation.I am the keynote
speaker on this summer course.I am a teacher at Beijing International
Studies University.In recent years,Dr.Xu and I joined a research group
on the topic of corpus study in linguistics and translation Studies.On
this summer course,we will introduce the main types of applicable corpus
in language studies and will help you to find out the appropriate type
of corpus for your specific studies.</p>
<p>A2: Good afternoon.I am happy to accept this interview.I was invited
to attend the teaching of this summer course because of my particular
experience in building up corpora for the language studies’ purposes.I
am a team member in the research group of corpus studies in the
University of Beijing International Studies.Professor Liang is my
colleague.</p>
<p>Q2: Thank you.After attending the first day of this course,I found
that the use of corpus in language studies is very important and
helpful.To discuss the use in translation studies,what are the main
types of corpora?</p>
<p>A1: According to the current situation in China,there are three main
types of corpora in translation studies: 1) corpora for English
learners; 2) parallel corpora and 3) English corpora for special
purposes.</p>
<p>A2: Yes,I agree with Professor Liang.And we will introduce these
types of corpora in the following days of the course.If time permits,we
will give you a chance to take a look of the corpus we just built up in
the last year,which is called the Chinese-English parallel corpus.</p>
<p>Q3: I am now doing research on the topic of animation film subtitling
translation.I need to compare the original subtitles with their
corresponding released translations.So,I would like to ask your
suggestions for finding an appropriate corpus to use in my study.</p>
<p>A1: Film subtitling translation is a new tendency in translation
studies in China.It is a good point,I think.Since you need to do many
comparative works,I recommend you to use a parallel
corpus.Unfortunately,however,there is no English-Chinese film subtitling
parallel corpus at this moment,so you probably need to build up your own
corpus for your own specific purposes.</p>
<p>A2: I also recommend you to search for relevant parallel corpora,both
in China and in the West.The big one built up by the University of
Lancaster will be worth referencing.The review of these corpora may also
help you to identify applicable software in building up the parallel
corpus.Maybe your special purpose corpus will be enlarged one day by
other scholars and this kind of corpus will be well developed in
China.</p>
<p>Q4: Thank you very much for your suggestions and encouragement! I
will try my best to accomplish this meaningful and hopeful task.Do you
have any suggestions on collecting effective data? I am worried about
collecting unofficial data from the Internet.</p>
<p>A1: This is an important concern.Since you are based in Shanghai,you
may apply to visit the Shanghai Translated Film Studio,one of biggest
translating films companies in China,which may offer you something
useful.</p>
<p>A2: You may also search on some official websites like
Sheshou,Douban,iqiyi.They are legal websites and relatively
reliable.</p>
<p>Q: Thank you very much for all your suggestions and your time! Your
advice is very helpful! Many thanks!</p>
<p>A: You are welcome!</p>
<p>3.Interview with Ms.He Dan,15 September 2015,Shanghai,China Brief
Introduction to the Interviewee</p>
<p>Ms.He Dan works at Shanghai University of Sport; she is a teacher in
the School of Arts and Media.Her study interests are
film-making,photographing and film editing.She is a practical film-maker
with over seven years’ experience.</p>
<p>Interview Topic</p>
<p>How many Chinese characters are suitable for an audience to read in
one line of a film subtitle?</p>
<p>Scholar’s Suggestions</p>
<p>“The acceptable and readable length should be around 18 to 23
characters in each frame of a film; then,if divided into two lines,no
more than 18 characters in a single line.However,when the subtitle is
over 18 Chinese characters,the subtitler needs to make a line and a half
to put in the whole content.Furthermore,the maximum number of subtitle
lines in one frame should be no more than two”.</p>
<p>Transcription</p>
<p>Q = questions asked by the researcher; A = answers from Ms.He</p>
<p>Q: Hi,Ms.He.Thank you for agreeing to this interview! Could you
please introduce yourself?</p>
<p>A: Hello,Ms.Jin.My name is He Dan,a young teacher in the Department
of Sports Media of Shanghai University of Sport.I mainly teach
film-making and photography courses.</p>
<p>Q: I know you also have practical experiences in making films at our
university,such as every year’s New Year’s Gala and interviews with
popular teachers of Shanghai University of Sport.</p>
<p>A: Yes.I started this work when I was a sophomore at this
university.</p>
<p>Q: As of this year,you have over five years’ experience in making
films.Do you also make subtitles for your films?</p>
<p>A: Yes.Each film-maker on our team can do every job when making a
film.Making subtitles is one of the important parts of our
postproduction.</p>
<p>Q: Ok.I would like to ask for your advice about the ideal length of
Chinese subtitles in a single line.</p>
<p>A: Ok,when I was a student,I learned from a textbook that the
acceptable and readable length should be around 18 to 23 characters in
each frame of a film.And in the context of my practical work,I agree
with this referenced range of numbers.However,I always try to make my
subtitles brief and simple.</p>
<p>Q: Fine.I also find that subtitlers sometimes use two lines to show a
long subtitle,do you think that is applicable?</p>
<p>A: According to my experience,if divided into two lines,no more than
18 characters in a single line.However,when the subtitle is over 18
Chinese characters,the subtitler needs to make a line and a half to put
in the whole content.Furthermore,the maximum number of subtitle lines in
one frame should be no more than two.</p>
<p>Q: Ok,I see.Thank you very much for your help!</p>
<p>A: I am happy to give you help.</p>
<p>4.Interview with Ms.Bunny Martin and Mr.Roy Loveday,25
October,2016,Surrey,UK</p>
<p>Brief Introduction to the Interviewees</p>
<p>Ms.Bunny Martin is a project director and a trainer in a youth
centre.She is also a practical film-maker with over 15 years’ work
experience.She also trains young people in making animation films during
their school vacations in a local community centre.</p>
<p>Mr.Roy Loveday is an audiovisual engineer and a manager in a
cinema.He has over 10 years’ work experience in animation filmmaking.He
is also a trainer in a local community centre.</p>
<p>Interview Topic</p>
<p>How many English characters/words are suitable for an audience to
read in one line of a film subtitle?</p>
<p>Scholars’ Suggestions</p>
<p>Ms.Martin suggests no more than 15 words in a single-line subtitle
and emphasizes the fact that it is important to put humour into the
subtitles in order to give the audience a sense of fun.The use of
slang,Bible stories and popular expressions are primary cultural memes
in subtitles.</p>
<p>Mr.Loveday suggests the ideal length of a single-line subtitle is
about 11 English words.When making animation films,he prefers to use
colloquial expressions in order to make the subtitle brief and
simple.</p>
<p>Practitioners’ Suggestions</p>
<p>For the first question,the two practitioners have different
ideas.However,both practitioners emphasized that the readability among
the audience is their standard when creating subtitles.</p>
<p>The second question asked about investigating the cultural components
in the source language.If these are noticed by the producer,when the
subtitlers translate the subtitles in to the target language,the
translation of culturally specific terms in the source culture should
not be neglected.The answers from the interviewees validate another of
the hypotheses outlined in this book; therefore,an awareness of cultural
components is essential in the subtitle translation.</p>
<p>Transcription</p>
<p>Q = questions asked by the researcher; A1 = answers from Ms.Martin;
A2 = answers from Mr.Loveday</p>
<p>Q1: Good afternoon,Ms.Martin,Mr.Loveday! Thank you for taking part in
this interview.I am a PhD student studying translated animation film
subtitling.May I ask you to give a brief selfintroduction first?</p>
<p>A1: Good afternoon,Ms.Jin.I am glad to take part in this interview.My
name is Bunny,I am a project director in a youth centre and have been a
practical film-maker for over 15 years.I also train young people in
animation film-making with Roy.As you see,we are now preparing the new
run of training for the coming week.</p>
<p>A2: Good afternoon! Thank you for your interview! My name is Roy,I am
Bunny’s colleague.I will later teach animation film making to a group of
young people.I am also a manager in a cinema and an audiovisual
engineer.I have over 10 years’ experience in animation film-making.</p>
<p>Q2: Thank you both.Since you are doing animation film making and
training,I would like to ask you about your experience of making
subtitles.Please talk about the ideal length of a single-line subtitle
in English.</p>
<p>A1: No more than 40 characters with spaces and punctuations.My own
estimation about the number of English words in a single-line subtitle
should be around 15 maximum.However,I should emphasize that my
estimation should only be a reference for experienced subtitlers,as they
ought to judge its validity visually according to their own
experience.Otherwise,subtitlers need to follow the regulation of 40
English characters in each single line strictly.</p>
<p>A2: Based on my experience,taking the factor of the age of the
audience in animation films into account,I advise the ideal length of a
single-line English subtitle to be within 11 words.</p>
<p>Q3: Do you prefer to use slang and English humour in your
animations?</p>
<p>A1: Yes,I like to use colloquial expressions and some typical English
expressions in subtitles.I think these can make people have more fun,and
make the language more approachable and similar to their real-life
language.</p>
<p>A2: Yes,I agree with Bunny.The use of typical local expressions can
attract audiences.In the making of animation films,I also encourage my
trainees to make subtitles by themselves.These young people prefer to
use oral and authentic language they are using in their real life.This
makes the animations vivid and real.By the way,I guess the translation
of English subtitles should try to keep the original language features
for the target audience,then they will know us more.</p>
<p>Q4: Yes,thank you for your suggestions.I agree with you.The use of
typical expressions in a language is one way to deliver the original
culture.The subtitlers should try their best to use authentic
expressions as much as possible.Since an animation film is typically an
entertaining and humorous film genre,the subtitles in this kind of film
need to be simple and colloquial.Yes,for translators of
subtitling,keeping the original humour is meaningful but changeable.We
are not always keeping everything as in the original; we need to keep a
balance between the audience’s ability to comprehend and the loyalty to
the original author of the film.Thank you for your time!</p>
<p>A1 and 2: You are welcome!</p>
<p>5.Interview with three subtitlers from the Shanghai Translated Film
Studio in September 2015,Shanghai,China</p>
<p>Brief Introduction to the Interviewees</p>
<p>The subtitlers were happy to share their working experiences with the
current researcher; they wished the following comments to be anonymously
recorded,because they regard their work as team efforts.</p>
<p>Mr.A is aged 37 years and has worked as a subtitle translator for 11
years since he received a master’s degree from university.</p>
<p>Mr.B is aged 48 years and is a team leader of a subtitle translation
group.He has a habit of paying attention to the grades and comments from
netizens on their translated films.</p>
<p>Ms.C is about 30 years of age; she is a young subtitler,but has over
five years of experience.Her experience helps her to be quickminded and
highly efficient in her subtitling translation work.</p>
<p>Interview Topic</p>
<p>Discussing awareness regarding the use of Chinese traditional
expressions and popular expressions in the subtitlers’ work,related to
their own work experience.</p>
<p>Practitioners’ Suggestions</p>
<p>The practitioners recommend using culturally loaded expressions such
as traditional expressions and popular expressions in subtitle
translation.On the one hand,they hope that the use of these types of
expressions makes foreign films more approachable to Chinese audiences;
on the other hand,they believe this is a way to develop and inherit
Chinese culture.The three practical subtitlers have different ways of
learning and collecting up-to-date popular expressions,always keeping an
eye on the quality of their translation.They believe the use of
culturally loaded expressions makes their translated film more
satisfying.</p>
<p>Transcription</p>
<p>Q = questions asked by the researcher; A1 = answers from Mr.A; A2 =
answers from Mr.B; A3 = answers from Ms.C</p>
<p>Q1: Good morning! Thank you for accepting this interview.I am a PhD
student in the field of subtitle translation in animation films.My
interview question is,do you agree with the use of culturally loaded
expressions,such as traditional expressions and popular expressions in
film subtitle translation,e.g.,idioms,vernacular words and popular
Internet expressions?</p>
<p>A1: Good morning.I am happy to talk about my experience.Yes.I think
it is an effective factor to use culturally loaded expressions in my
translation.</p>
<p>A2: Yes,I also pay attention to the use of these typical
expressions.I think these language expressions make the translation
vivid and real.</p>
<p>A3: For English animation films,most of the subtitles are dialogues
and episodes.The use of these expressions can help me to find solutions
to translate in an oral and sometimes rhythmic way.</p>
<p>Q2: Thanks.Can you please share with me your experience of learning
and using these types of expressions?</p>
<p>A1: I began using traditional Chinese expressions in 2005,which was
my second year of working in this company.I carried out a survey in
certain cinemas,finding that audiences had a more enjoyable experience
when they read and heard Chinese traditional expressions in a foreign
film.From that time,in order to meet the audience’s preference,I began
to notice the use of such kinds of expressions.For young audiences,they
are in the process of learning Chinese idioms and archaisms in school,so
when we use these expressions in animation film translation,they may
feel that the film is accessible.And for us adults,we have language
customs in terms of using traditional expressions,such as idioms in our
daily communication,so the use of this type of expression in translated
subtitles is greatly acceptable.Thanks to Baidu [the biggest online
search engine in China],in the process of my translating,Baidu helps me
to immediately correct and confirm some expressions I am uncertain
of.</p>
<p>A2: I always try my best to use traditional expressions and popular
expressions in my translation as much as possible.One more advantage I
found besides the one Mr.A just mentioned is that the use of idioms can
make shorter and more vivid translations than direct translations.And
the use of popular expressions makes the overall translation more
localized.We now have a new tendency in film translation,which is
localization,which seeks to make the translation more like local
language and closer to the local culture.I agree with this tendency.Film
products are commercials,and part of our duty; we should make sure our
translation is welcomed by the audience.I also have a habit of looking
at online feedback from audiences about translated film
subtitles,concluding that the turning point in the development of
translated film subtitling occurred with Garfield [2005].</p>
<p>A3: I always have two particular reference books by my side when
working: 300 Ancient Chinese Poems [by Zeng Guoli,published in 2010 by
the Publishing House of Jiangsu Province] and Chinese Idiom Stories [by
the Shanghai People’s Fine Arts Publishing House in 1952,published in
2007).Although these two books belong to the teenage reader group in
China,they are very helpful in my practical work.I think they are
suitable for me because my translation style pursues simple but
effective expressions.</p>
<p>Q3: Thank you very much for your invaluable shared experience!</p>
<p>A1,2 and 3: You are welcome!</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>In the answer from the second interviewee,there is a mention of the
turning point in the history of translated animation films in China.This
turning point is the translation of the 2005 film Garfield.Starting with
this translated animation film,more and more scholars,practitioners and
netizens have become aware of the use of typical expressions from
popular language.The researcher carried out an investigation into this
specific historic turning point in order to find more evidence to
certify the importance of using popular expressions in current animation
film translation.</p>
<p>According to the research,in this film,the translated subtitles
comprised more than 34 per cent of expressions,which were culturally
loaded Chinese words,including traditional expressions and popular
Internet words.Over 32 per cent (2,810 out of 8,769) of netizens (net
citizens) stated that they had noticed these expressions,while 60 per
cent (168 out of 281) indicated their preference for these kinds of
expressions.</p>
<p>It also needs to be mentioned here that the researcher searched
online,on reputable Chinese academic websites,such as
www.lunwenqikan.net and www.cnki.net,where she found 23 papers from the
past five years,which discussed the translation in Garfield,in which the
two main discussion points were traditional expressions and popular
Internet expressions.For instance,in Xiao Cong’s dissertation
(2012:33),he emphasized the success of using culturally loaded
expressions in the subtitling of Garfield 2.Meanwhile,for Tian Weijun
(2013:39),the purpose of subtitle translation is to help the target
audience comprehend the film,so the culturally loaded expressions with
some specific strategies in the subtitling may have positive effects on
enabling the target audience to understand the purpose.Meanwhile,Wang
Yuwei (2008: 36) pointed out that “a good quality of subtitling
translation can definitely help the exported film win popularity in its
foreign markets”.</p>
<p>Further Opinions Indirectly Made by More Practitioners</p>
<p>Besides the three teammates’ practical comments,the leaders of the
team,all of whom are famous subtitlers in this company,expressed similar
ideas in their interview at the Shanghai ACME Translation Co.Ltd.The
team leader,Mr.Gu Qiyong,along with his teammates,finished the subtitle
translation of Garfield 2.His idea of putting many popular expressions
into the film translation made this film’s subtitling a hot topic at
that time in China.Audiences commented that “this translation of the
film really moved the inner heart of the audience” (Gu Qiyong,cited in
Wang Xiaojing 2012).However,he also emphasized the “degree” of using
this kind of expression in subtitle translation.He worried that the
excessive use of this kind of expression will also arouse the dislike of
the audience.Another practical subtitler named Lu Yaorong shared her
experience of subtitling,stating that subtitling should obey the
original meaning of the language and culture,such that subtitlers are
not required to rewrite or recreate too drastically.They should find an
equivalent as much as possible,or consider how to use culturally loaded
expressions to highlight meaning in the subtitling.</p>
<p>6.Interview with Professor Xiao Weiqing and Professor Wang Kun,25
June 2015,Taiwan</p>
<p>Brief Introduction to the Interviewees</p>
<p>Professor Xiao works at Shanghai International Studies
University,whose main interest is audiovisual translation.She is one of
the famous keynote speakers in the series of summer courses in
translation studies at her university.</p>
<p>Professor Wang works at Shaanxi Technology University,whose main
interest is translation studies from the perspective of intercultural
communication.</p>
<p>Topic</p>
<p>High-graded animation films and the component of the quality of
subtitling in these films.</p>
<p>Scholars’ Main Opinions</p>
<p>Based on her opinions and experience,Professor Xiao from Shanghai
International Studies University,whose main interest is audiovisual
translation,said that higher-marked animation films in the Chinese
market are bound to be of good quality when it comes to the translated
subtitles.Audiences will probably rely for the most part on the
translated subtitles to comprehend unfamiliar cultural elements in a
film,such as the names of some characters,the customs and some of the
humour.If the subtitlers neglect the translation of these culturally
loaded expressions,the film may lose some of its
impact.Meanwhile,Professor Wang,who works at Shannxi Technology
University,shared her research results with the current researcher,both
of whom had conducted a questionnaire survey with cinema audiences.For
her part,she found that,in her investigated film types,animation films
will attract more young people in the age range of 15-30 years
old.Moreover,this age range will pay more attention to the quality of
the translated films when they watch exported English-language films and
the quality of the language when they watch Chinese imported films.This
age range also places an emphasis on the importance of using culturally
loaded expressions in the film subtitles,because they considered that
this kind of expression can make the translated films more acceptable to
the target markets and elicit a spectator’s sense of familiarity with
well-established national cultural-linguistic patterns.Moreover,because
they are generally a group of citizens in China,who received or are
receiving a good education,they have a high expectation about the
quality of the language in a film.And because their daily lives are
characterized by online activities,they are the sort of active
participants to grade the films they watch,writing down their personal
comments online on certain websites and expressing their own feelings
about the films they have watched.According to these investigations,the
researcher can now conclude that the grades and the specific comments in
the mentioned websites arguably show the importance of the quality of
subtitling to a film,as well as the fact that culturally loaded
expressions are able to increase an audiences’ satisfaction with a
film.</p>
<p>Transcription</p>
<p>Q = questions asked by the researcher; A1 = answers from Professor
Xiao; A2 = answers from Professor Wang</p>
<p>Q1: Good afternoon,Professor Xiao and Professor Wang.I am happy to
meet you in Taiwan.Taiwan is beautiful; it is my first time to come to
here.Is this your first time here?</p>
<p>A1: No,I’ve been here once for casual traveling.I like this beautiful
island as well.And this time is more meaningful for me because I can
share my study with my peers like you two.</p>
<p>A2: Yes,this is the first time I have been here.Ms.Jin,did you know
we arrived here on the same flight?</p>
<p>Q2: Really? How amazing.We took the same flight to attend the same
conference and share similar study interests! And Professor Xiao,I
actually met you and talked with you once on the 2013 summer course at
your university.</p>
<p>A1: Yes.I remembered.You told me that you just started your PhD study
in Britain,and asked me if your research topic was effective.</p>
<p>A2: Yes.I saw you in the passengers’ waiting area in Xianyang
International Airport.</p>
<p>Q3: I am very appreciative that I can meet you two for a second time
at this conference.This will be very helpful for my research study.May I
ask,what is the importance of the quality of translation in translated
animation films?</p>
<p>A1: I have been teaching on a translation course by using audiovisual
materials for over five years.According to my observation,the quality of
the translated subtitles is a key point when my students discuss the
quality of a film.Because they are English major students,studying and
analysing the quality of the translated subtitles is also a part of
their main task.They may pay more attention to this aspect,rather than
the aspects of story line,frames or music.</p>
<p>A2: I am always accompanied by my 11-year-old son when I watch
animation films at the cinema.For the two types of translated animation
films in China,the original English audio but translated Chinese
subtitled ones and the translated Chinese audio and visual ones,I always
choose the first type for the purpose of improving my son’s English
proficiency.</p>
<p>I think the audiences of my son’s age will rely on the translated
subtitles to understand the film,so it is important to make a good
quality translation in subtitles for this type of audience.For
me,because of my major and the difficulty level of the subtitles in
animation films,I usually comprehend the film by listening; the
translated subtitles are less important to me.However,I may also have an
interest in reading these subtitles because of my profession; I always
want to check the accuracy of the translated subtitles.</p>
<p>Q4: Yes.Different types of audiences may have different degrees of
needs when using the translated subtitles.In my study,I also like to
investigate the opinions expressed in the majority of translated
animation films in China.Do you have suggestions on the majority group
of this genre of films?</p>
<p>A1: According to my previous questionnaire survey,the majority of
audiences for English translated animation films comprise young
people,the age group of my college students.And over 90% of my students
are fans of this genre of films.They may also habitually write their
comments about the quality of the films they watch on relevant websites
or online forums.</p>
<p>A2: I also conducted a similar survey with my students in three
cinemas.The result was that this kind of film may attract more young
people in the 15-30 age range compared with other types of translated
films in the Chinese market.When I interviewed some of my students,their
general view was that they think that translated animation films are
always funny and interesting,that the main characters are adorable and
that these films always educate people or encourage people in life.They
also like this kind of film because it is a good way to practise their
English listening comprehension and improve their ability of
English-Chinese interpretation.Most young people will choose to watch
the animation films with the original English audio soundtrack but with
translated Chinese subtitles.</p>
<p>Q5: Thank you.My last question is about whether you think the use of
traditional expressions,such as idioms and archaisms,and the use of
popular expressions,such as slang and popular Internet words,are helpful
for emphasizing the importance of cultural components in subtitle
translations?</p>
<p>A1: Yes.I agree that these kinds of culturally loaded expressions
should be used as much as possible in film translation.They can make the
translation more vivid and attractive to the audience.Most English
animation films are interesting and funny,so I think the use of popular
expressions may keep or imitate the original humour to a good degree.For
the use of traditional expressions,as you mentioned,idioms and archaisms
embody Chinese traditional culture,while their unique word formation can
help subtitlers to make more succinct subtitles.</p>
<p>A2: Yes,I agree too.We have a language custom of using idioms and
popular Internet memes in our daily life.The use of these expressions in
film translation is an authentic way of translation for the target
audience.</p>
<p>Q6: Thank you very much,both of you! Your comments and experiences
will be invaluable to my research.</p>
<p>A1 and 2: You are welcome!</p>
