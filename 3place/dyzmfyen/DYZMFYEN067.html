<h4 id="key-points-of-carrying-out-the-questionnaire">4.5.1　Key Points
of Carrying Out the Questionnaire</h4>
<ol type="a">
<li>Ethical Considerations</li>
</ol>
<p>Ethical considerations play an inevitable role in all research
studies,while all researchers must consider the ethics related to their
studies.“In research,the ends do not justify the means,and the
researchers must not put their need to carry out a study above their
responsibility to maintain the well-being of the study
participants.Research studies are built on trust between a researcher
and the participants,and researchers has a responsibility to behave in a
trustworthy manner,just as they expect participants to” (Gay 2006:
73).</p>
<p>Furthermore,research that is contingent on the contribution of human
subjects ought to require even more careful pre-consideration given that
research participants may experience stress,anxiety,and a great number
of other consequences (Robinson 2011: 194).For this particular research
project,it is necessary to ensure that both ethical and legal issues are
considered throughout the research process,with particular consideration
given to the type of respondents involved (that is,undergraduate
students mostly majoring in English).</p>
<p>First of all,the key ethical issues in research are involved with the
participants’ right to give informed consent and enjoy freedom from harm
(Gay 2006: 74).Otherwise,collecting information from participants is
regarded as unethical.Therefore,at the beginning of the research
process,I am committed to explaining and informing all the participants
of the overall purpose of her study and the stepby-step procedures of
participation.The related written documents about the research
purpose,the detailed participation process,and the proof of Ethical
Approval from the Ethical Research Committee at the University of
Salford is to be provided to all participants; all the related documents
with official signatures are in Appendix 3.To make sure that all the
participants fully understand and are acquainted with the study
requirements and purposes,as well as ensure that they avoid any
risks,anonymity and confidentiality issues will underpin every stage of
the questionnaire process: its completion,its submission,the data
analysis and the production of the research findings.This is taken as a
basic requirement by ethical research boards and committees as well as
the UK’s Data Protection Act (1998).In so doing,I am responsible for
keeping participants’ identities anonymous and reminding them not to
sign their names on the questionnaire at the beginning or at the end of
their answers.In my final report,I generally ought to be able to
identify the group of participants,their education background
information,age range,etc.Within qualitative research,aspects of the
participants’ individuality,such as their likeness and voice,are not
critical given the general nature of questionnaires as a quantitative
research tool.Therefore,issues regarding anonymity,the explanation of
the research,how to keep all data confidential,the use of these data in
the step of research findings is explained to all participants at the
beginning of the questionnaire so that the research meets the basic
requirements of informed consent.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Preparation</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to meet the requirements of the Ethical Research Committee
at the University of Salford,as well as the UK’s Data Protection Act
(1998),it was necessary to provide the following information to all the
respondents before asking them to answer the questionnaire; this was
indispensable in order to ensure their comprehension and
support.First,it was necessary to outline the research topic and its
objectives,and the project’s academic context to the respondents.</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>Research Topic</li>
</ol>
<p>The current research topic is called “A Comparative Analysis of Film
Subtitle Translation from English in Chinese:A Case Study of 15 Popular
Animation Films”.The research aims to test three research hypotheses,as
well as discuss the main issues and effective solutions related to the
subtitling of the sample film Despicable Me 1 from the perspective of
cultural awareness.</p>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>Academic Context</li>
</ol>
<p>AVT is a new area of study within translation studies.Scholars from
Western countries were the first to undertake theoretical work regarding
translation.Examples include Jorge Diaz-Cintas’s discussion about the
application of descriptive translation studies (DTS) and Even-Zohar’s
polysystem theory in relation to the field of AVT (2004).In
addition,scholars in the field of subtitle translation,such as Henrik
Gottlieb,have proposed 10 translation strategies appropriate to AVT.This
research project builds on the aforementioned theoretical work by
scoping and interrogating further issues and strategic possibilities for
movie caption translation between English and Chinese.The research
expectations are to define common issues for,and identify,effective
translation strategies to improve the quality of translation work in the
context of movie subtitles.However,the intrinsic problems that
complicate such translation work — given that English and Chinese belong
to two different language families — are also taken into account.In
other words,arriving at an “equivalent” translation between these two
languages may be more difficult to achieve than that between English and
a language from the same or similar language family.Moreover,the huge
cultural divide between the East and West means that there are always
significant challenges in delivering information from the Source Text
(ST) to the Target Text (TT).Thus,the realistic contribution of this
research project will be to set out the common issues and develop
suitable strategies in the English/Chinese movie caption translating
process and,more broadly,to extend the theory of subtitle translation
into this very specific cultural-linguistic context.Firstly,this
research aims to examine the advantages of applying traditional Chinese
expressions (idioms,archaisms) and those of applying popular expressions
(popular language in networks,new words,loaning words and dialects) as
culturally loaded expressions in English-Chinese subtitling.Moreover,the
use of these two kinds of expressions while be combined with appropriate
translation strategies (four strategies according to Gottlieb),and
another two novel strategies used in subtitling in the last five
years).Then,as a research result,I will design a measuring scale by
referencing the data results from my research study.The measuring scale
will be improved and completed by continuously collecting more data for
my corpus.Detailed discussion about how to develop this theory by
analysing the main issues in the present data and studying effective
translation strategies will be provided in a later part of this
chapter.</p>
<p>Secondly,it was important to explain to the students that the reason
for inviting them to answer a questionnaire was to obtain firsthand
information to enable the researcher to shed light on the two questions
mentioned above and also,ultimately,to improve the quality of subtitles
that millions of other spectators read when they watch a foreign
language film.The students were told that their selection as
participants was based on the reasonable assumptions that: they form
part of the potential audience for these translated films; they possess
a good level of knowledge in E-C translation; they would also be
familiar with the use of traditional Chinese expressions (such as idioms
and archaisms) and popular expressions (such as vernacular and language
made popular in networks).In addition,the purpose of the questionnaire
was to test whether the discussed translation strategies were more
effective in engaging the audience’s visual attention
and,furthermore,whether the Chinese language peculiarities of
idioms,archaisms and popular expressions were welcomed by the
audience.As such,it was explained that the questionnaire would be in
three parts: the first part consisted of 15 paired-choice questions
about two alternative translations marked as “A” and “B”.The second part
consisted of multiple choice questions whose purpose was to calibrate
audience preferences towards the use of culturally loaded Chinese
words.The last part of the questionnaire was an open question that
invited suggestions from the students as spectators for E-C subtitling;
here,the participants were invited to write down their own suggestions
to improve the translations of these aforementioned films.</p>
<p>Lastly,it was necessary to give the students instructions about the
process of answering the questionnaire.The expected time for completing
the questionnaire was 30 minutes and it would be completed
anonymously.In answering all the questions in this questionnaire,it was
anticipated that the students would refer to the experience and
knowledge that they had acquired on their translation and interpretation
courses over a two-year period,and share their personal viewpoints on
the translated subtitles of recently released animation films.The
students would personally place their questionnaires into an envelope
and put them into a pre-prepared box at the front of the classroom
before they left.I would analyse the collected data in the second stage
of her work.The electronic data would be password-protected and all hard
copies of the completed questionnaire would be stored in a locked filing
cabinet.The source of the data would be generically described as
“undergraduates from Shanghai University of Sport and Fudan
University”.Moreover,I reiterated my appreciation to all the
participants and emphasized to them that,with their help,the data from
the questionnaires would make an important contribution to the
development of this research project.Furthermore,the findings of this
research would be made available to film subtitling companies in order
to improve the subtitles of films that the participants and many other
spectators from different generations watch.</p>
