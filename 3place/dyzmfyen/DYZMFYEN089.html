<h4 id="several-issues-appearing-in-the-current-data">6.2.2　Several
Issues Appearing in the Current Data</h4>
<p>According to the data from ParaConc,the researcher found that there
are inappropriate uses of traditional expressions in the subtitle
translations of the selected 15 films:</p>
<p>Table 6</p>
<p>As the above chart shows,in Despicable Me 2,there are three
translated subtitles involving inappropriate traditional expressions;
the recommended translations are given by the researcher as follows:</p>
<p>00:12:34,462 to 00:12:36,633</p>
<p>Ah,pins and needles! (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>啊，抓心挠肝啊！（Released translation）</p>
<p>Ah,so worried! (Back translation)</p>
<p>Suggestions： For “pins and needles”，there is a standard translation
to it — “如坐针毡” （seems to sit on the pins and needles/ thorns）； it
is also an idiom in Chinese，which means someone is very anxious about
something or somebody.To adhere to the most important criterion in
translation，“如坐针毡” is more faithful to the original dialogue and
appropriate to its context； there is no need to use another idiom with
a similar meaning.</p>
<p>00:13:50,038 to 00:13:53,759</p>
<p>Um,recently,an entire top-secret lab (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>最近一个高级机密实验室（Released translation）</p>
<p>disappeared from the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>从北极圈莫名消失了（Released translation）</p>
<p>Um,recently,an entire top-secret lab disappeared inexplicably from
the Arctic Circle (Back translation).</p>
<p>Suggestions： This a two-line subtitle in the film，which indicates
that the subtitler opted against using a single-line subtitle to convey
the same information on grounds of length.In this situation，it is
better to avoid using an expansion strategy in translation.In the given
released translation，“莫名” are the added words from the original
subtitle.Meaning “inexplicable”，or “sometimes”，these characters can be
an abbreviation of the Chinese idiom “莫名其妙”，which means “to have no
idea about something or make somebody feel confused and
discombobulated”.However，in this specific subtitle，the original word
“disappeared” has equivalence in Chinese，that is，“消失”，which can
fully explain the original meaning，meaning that the use of “莫名消失”
is not necessary.Another important criterion in translation，“to be
brief and simple”，is also important.</p>
<p>00:52:02,995 to 00:52:06,293</p>
<p>You know,tear it up,see what happens! (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>打破常规，顺其自然！（Released translation）</p>
<p>Breaking the rules,let it be! (Back translation)</p>
<p>Suggestions： In the film，according to the context，“tear it up” is
the speaker’s suggestion to change the original plan.Therefore，the
translation should be equivalent to “tear up the original plan”.“Plan”
is a more generic word，unlike “rules”，which are more serious and need
to be strictly followed to avoid breaking the law or committing a
crime.However，“plan” can be an individual plan，such that when it is
changed，it will not hurt others.Similarly，in Chinese，“plan” and
“rules” have standard equivalent expressions： “计划” and
“法律”，“条规”.Therefore，translating “tear it up” into “打破计划” or
“改变计划” will retain the original meaning to an acceptable degree.</p>
<p>In Frozen,there are two translated subtitles,which feature
inappropriately used traditional expressions.</p>
<p>00:02:00,171 to 00:02:03,574</p>
<p>This icy force both foul and fair.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>冰雪的力量让人难以忍受但绝对公平。（Released translation）</p>
<p>This icy force is both oppressive and extremely fair.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>Suggestions： This subtitle is one of the lyrics in the song at the
beginning of the film.A suggested translation，in consideration of the
ideal length，is “冰雪的力量既冷酷又公正” （This icy force both cruel
and fair）.Firstly，the researcher chose two two-character expressions
to replace the given two idioms in order to make the length shorter；
secondly，“难以忍受” meaning “oppressive”，is an indirect expression of
the original word “foul”.However，“冷酷” meaning “cruel”，is much closer
to the original word.Thirdly，the use of four-character idioms is an
expansion of the original text — “绝对公平” compares with
“公平”，although it sounds more serious given the speaker’s
attitude，such that a degree of expression is not necessary in the given
context.In order to maintain a balance between the two adjectives，as
used in the original text，“公平” is matched with “冷酷”，meaning that
the number of characters retains the same rhythm as its correlative
lyrics.</p>
<p>00:07:24,997 to 00:07:30,941</p>
<p>But she won’t remember I have powers? (Original translation)</p>
<p>她不会记得我有魔力？（Released translation）</p>
<p>She won’t remember I have magic powers? (Back translation)</p>
<p>It’s for the best.(Original translation)</p>
<p>这是为了防患未然。（Released translation）</p>
<p>It’s for nipping the bud.(Back translation)</p>
<p>Suggestions： The underlined idiom is the released translation of the
original text，“for the best”.“防患未然” is commonly used to refer to
preventing something dangerous from happening.According to the context
of the film，the speaker is stating that “she wants to protect her
sister from being hurt by her magic”，because the speaker’s magic power
may hurt her unintentionally.From this point of view，the translation is
correct.However，the equivalent meaning of “for the best” in Chinese，is
“出于好意”.In terms of the whole subtitle，a simpler and shorter
translation could be “这是为她好” （It’s good for her）.This translation
is，on the one hand，a brief colloquial expression； on the other
hand，unlike idioms，which sound like official and formal language，it
expresses the elder sister’s sincere concern for and protection towards
her younger sister.Then，in Alpha and Omega，there is one imperfect use
of traditional expressions in the released translation：</p>
<p>00:19:20,185 to 00:19:22,483</p>
<p>Tails and ears are falling off,literally.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>尾巴和耳朵一日不如一日，真的。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Tail and ears become worse and worse day by day,literally.</p>
<p>(Back translation)</p>
<p>Suggestions： In this film，the main character is a wolf； in the
original subtitle “tails and ears are falling off” naturally shows the
wolf becomes old or unhealthy or upset.Therefore，the subtitler tries to
use the Chinese archaism “一日不如一日” to explain the indicated meaning
of the original text.However，I think the direct translation of this
specific subtitle can make the translated meaning more vivid and
graphic： “尾巴和耳朵都开始耷拉了” （tails and ears are falling
off）.“耷拉” is a colloquial expression to describe something
drooping.From this example，the use of traditional expressions is not
always better than the direct translation； the subtitler needs to think
over and compare the functions of each of the translation methods in
order to make the translation better.</p>
<p>In Turbo，the subtitler uses a difficult idiom in the translated
subtitle.The main difficulty for mainstream audiences here involves the
use of the last two characters of this idiom： “轩轾” （high and
low），because they are ancient words which are rarely found within
modern Chinese usage.</p>
<p>00:06:07,460 to 00:06:08,490</p>
<p>They’re neck and neck! (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>他们难分轩轾。（Released translation）</p>
<p>They’re difficult to tell the high or low.(Back translation)</p>
<p>Suggestions： Although this is a correct idiom with which to
translate the original text，the last two characters in the idiom are
rarely used in modern Chinese.Another idiom that may be better to use
here because of its simple characters is： “难分高低” （Difficult to
tell the high or low）.Compared with “轩轾”，“高低” is a more common
idiom within everyday life in China； therefore，the latter is more
comprehensible and acceptable to mainstream audiences.</p>
<p>In Madagascar 1,there is an idiom used in the translated subtitle
with the same problem as the above:</p>
<p>00:14:26,150 to 00:14:31,670</p>
<p>We make a great team.The two of us.— We sure do.No doubt about it!
(Original translation)</p>
<p>我们是一个伟大的团队。我们俩。—当然。毋庸置疑！</p>
<p>(Released translation)</p>
<p>We are a great team.We two.—We sure are.No doubt about it! (Back
translation)</p>
<p>Suggestions： The use of “毋庸置疑” is correct for expressing the
original meaning of “no doubt about it”； however，the four characters
in this idiom are difficult and complex.This idiom is commonly used in
literary texts as a formal written term.Another idiom with a similar
meaning，but which is composed of relatively simple
characters，“毫无疑问”，is more suitable for use in a subtitle
translation in this kind of a situation or context.</p>
<p>Again,in Madagascar 1,another use of a traditional idiom does not
appropriately express the original meaning of the text:</p>
<p>00:54:36,050 to 00:54:39,530</p>
<p>It’s like billions and billions of helicopters.(Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>像是许许多多的直升机。 （Released translation）</p>
<p>It’s like lots of helicopters.(Back translation)</p>
<p>Suggestions： From the back translation，it is clear that “lots of”
and “billions and billions” do not express the same degree in
quantitative terms.Therefore，the suggested translation of the original
phrase is “数以亿计的” （direct translation） or “无数的”
（uncountable），which is closer to the original meaning.</p>
<p>In Cars 1,there is one inappropriate translation in a subtitle as a
consequence of using a traditional expression:</p>
<p>00:08:04,030 to 00:08:06,890</p>
<p>He’s got it in the bag.Call in the dogs and put out the fire!
(Original translation)</p>
<p>他的冠军已经手到擒来了。可以把拉拉队叫出来欢呼了吧！（Released
translation）</p>
<p>He’s nearly got the champion already.Call in the dogs and put out the
fire! (Back translation)</p>
<p>Suggestions： The given translation explained the meaning of the
original text； however，there is another traditional expression in
Chinese，which is a direct match for the original pattern of “got it in
the bag”： “冠军已是他的囊中之物”.The underlined word is an idiom，with
the first character “囊” from ancient Chinese language，meaning a bag or
a pocket.This could be a complete translation of the original text，with
the corresponding word of “bag”.Therefore，“手到擒来” is weaker than
“囊中之物” in this translation.</p>
<p>The last imperfection in the selected data of the 15 films,in terms
of using traditional expressions in a translated subtitle,is found in
Cars 2:</p>
<p>00:56:09,756 to 00:56:12,919</p>
<p>A wise car hears one word and understands two.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>一辆聪明的汽车总是善于察言观色。（Released translation）</p>
<p>A wise car always carefully watches what people are doing and
saying.(Back translation)</p>
<p>Suggestions： From the back translation，it is clear that this
Chinese idiom involves two aspects — doing and saying — the behaviour
and the remarks.However，the original text only conveys the meaning of
“saying something” with one direct meaning and an indicated meaning as
well.Therefore，the correct translation could be： “听话听音”； this
comes from a Chinese folk adage “听锣听声，听话听音”，which means
“listen for the meaning behind somebody’s words”.This is considered to
have a similar meaning to “hears one word and understands two” in the
original text.</p>
<p>Generally,according to the investigation into the corpus data,I found
that the majority of the released translated subtitles involving the use
of traditional expressions are appropriate,as they are more interesting
in terms of expression and more acceptable in terms of culture.</p>
<p>In addition,I also examined and compared the five-film series in
turn,finding that the total number of subtitles and the frequency of the
use of traditional expressions mainly increased as each series
progressed.Among the 15 selected films,Madagascar 3 not only has the
highest frequency concerning the use of traditional expressions in the
translated subtitles (see the chart in the previous section,p.178),but
is also considered overall to have the highest quality when using
traditional expressions in 133 out of a total of 1,293 translated
subtitles.</p>
<p>To sum up,traditional expressions,such as Chinese idioms and
archaisms (two main types of traditional expression appearing in the
given data,according to the investigation),can reflect traditional
Chinese culture.Furthermore,in modern Chinese language use,these two
types of traditional expression not only appear in written form,but also
in the everyday colloquialisms of the general public.It is arguable that
the use of these two types of traditional expression generally mirrors
Chinese people’s language custom as they conduct their daily
life.Therefore,the use of traditional expressions in foreign film
subtitle translation is an effective way to make the translated
subtitles more interesting and acceptable,as well as to attract more
people to watch the films.</p>
<p>Then,in terms of assessing audiences’ attitudes towards the use of
traditional expressions,I carried out a more detailed investigation by
using a questionnaire.In the next section,I will describe and discuss
the data result from the questionnaire survey.</p>
