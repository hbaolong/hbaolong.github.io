<h4 id="data-analysis-on-related-short-lnterviews">5.1　Data Analysis on
Related Short lnterviews</h4>
<p>In the past three years,I encountered these interviewees in different
academic contexts,such as international conferences,study workshops and
internships.The different scholars and practitioners expressed different
viewpoints.In the following chapters on data analysis,I will describe
these useful encounters where there is relevance to one of the specific
hypotheses.</p>
<p>Before comparing the length difference between the Chinese translated
subtitle and the corresponding original English dialogue,the ideal
length of any kind of language subtitles should be evaluated based on
the effectiveness of the subtitles.It is obvious that Chinese subtitles
and English subtitles will have different length standards because of
their different natures.</p>
<p>From the point of view of film producing,theorists and practitioners
have varied criteria when it comes to the ideal length of subtitles.For
example,as in the previous chapter of literature review
mentioned,similar with Zhang and Wang’s recommendation of “no more than
14 Chinese characters per line” (2012:139),Xiang pointed out that the
number of Chinese characters in each film subtitle line should be 14-15
(with spaces and punctuations); however,the number of English characters
is 40 (with spaces and punctuations) (2014: 306).According to the
knowledge of “character”,one Chinese word equates to one character,while
different words of English will be composed of a different number of
letters.Therefore,when calculating the number of English subtitles,it is
not possible to calculate by the unit of words,but by the unit of
letters.In other words,40 characters may involve a different number of
English words,but a certain number of letters.However,some practitioners
with different working experiences had different ideas concerning a
standard number for the ideal length of single-lined subtitles.He in her
answer of “How many Chinese characters in one line in a film subtitle is
suitable for an audience to read?”:</p>
<p>The acceptable and readable length should be around 18 to 23
characters on each frame of a film.Then,if divided into lines,no more
than 18 characters in a single line.However,when the subtitle is over 18
Chinese characters long,the subtitler needs to create a line and a half
to put in the whole content.Furthermore,the maximum number of subtitle
lines on one frame should be no more than two.</p>
<p>Another practitioner,Liu is the Associate President of the Shanghai
Translated Film Studio.In one of his interviews,he recommended that
subtitlers make a single-line subtitle within a limit of 13 Chinese
characters,since this length of a subtitle will make the audience feel
“comfortable”.As well as the investigation into the ideal length of
Chinese subtitles,the researcher also reviewed the ideal length of
English subtitles in order to make an effective comparison and
reference.When the original English is translated into Chinese,the
original length can help the subtitler to estimate the length of the
translation,such that it is obvious that a smaller difference in length
from the original text will be more acceptable.Thus,for the theory of
the standard length of English subtitles,besides the idea proposed by
Xiang,I interviewed two practitioners in the study of producing
animation works in the UK.</p>
<p>Bunny Martin trains young people in making animation films as part of
their school vocations.During the talk with Martin，I asked the question
about the ideal length of a single-line subtitle in English，Martin
replying that it should be “no more than 40 characters （with spaces and
punctuations）”.This is completely in line with the theory presented by
Xiang in his （2014） book《实用电影摄制手册》 （Practical Film-making
Handbook）.Moreover，she also gave her own estimation of a single-lined
number of English words as around 15 as its maximum.The ideal number of
words she gave is the same as Yang （2012，cited in Yang 2014： 174）：
“the perfect length for a single-line subtitle is no more than 15
English words and no more than two lines on one frame”.However，she
emphasized that her estimation should only be a reference to experienced
subtitlers，who may judge its validity visually according to their own
experience； otherwise，subtitlers need to follow the regulation of 40
English characters in each single line strictly.Another practitioner is
Martin’s colleague，Roy Loveday，when taking the age of the audience in
animation films into account，advised the ideal length of a single-line
English subtitle to be within 11 words.</p>
<p>To sum up,the general opinions about the first hypothesis concerning
the ideal length of a single-line subtitle in English and in Chinese are
two-fold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Some interviewees insist on acting in accordance with the
corresponding theories,for examples,Xiang (2014),Zhang and Wang
(2012).As they think this is the best way to guarantee that the
subtitles meet the mechanical requirements as a key component of film
products,whether or not the film is English language,Chinese language or
translated.Furthermore,different kinds of language versions should have
differing ideal numbers of words or characters according to their
different language peculiarities.Besides,while some of them emphasized
that one frame of a film should have,at most,two-line
subtitles,subtitlers should consider making a longer subtitle into one
and a half lines or two short lines in a frame,otherwise,the subtitles
will not be fully read or understood by the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>Some practitioners’ ideas may differ from the above interviewees
as well as differ among themselves.Their views on ideal length are as
follows: 18-25 Chinese characters in a single line,13 Chinese characters
at the most,15 characters would be fine.For English words,their ideals
are similar: around 15 words.They all agree that,because of the
characteristics of animation films,the dialogues in the films are always
simple and brief,such that the expected English original text should
generally be short.The estimation concerning the Chinese translated
subtitles is that they should not be too long,but the length of a
Chinese translated subtitle might be greater than the corresponding
original text in English,when considering many other kinds of
factors,such as cultural differences,language family differences and
oral expression differences.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Different scholars and practitioners in varied working situations
stated different understandings on the ideal length of subtitles in
English and in Chinese.According to the interviewees’ answers,the ideal
length of a Chinese subtitle is between 13 and 25 characters; the ideal
length of an English subtitle is 13-15 words.It can therefore be said
that Chinese subtitles are normally greater than English subtitles in
their original difference of word formations.With this in mind,in the
following section,I will estimate the possible lengths of Chinese
translated subtitles and the corresponding English original subtitles in
animation films,after which I will test whether the former subtitles are
generally greater than the latter ones.If yes,what is the average length
difference between them according to the data? If not,what are the
factors that inhibit the estimation? Moreover,in order to inform the
future practice of subtitle translation work on animation films,what is
the ideal length of Chinese translated subtitles that I can suggest to
other practitioners?</p>
