the Effectiveness of Using Popular Expressions in E-C Subtitle
Translation</h4>
<p>Alongside the traditional expressions described in the last
chapter,the researcher regards traditional expressions and popular
expressions as forms of culturally loaded words in the subtitle
translations of the 15 films.In contrast with traditional expressions
(representative of traditional culture),popular expressions (as
explained in the previous section) embody the language tendency in
modern Chinese,as it contains elements of Internet memes (more examples
will be discussed in Section 7.3),newly created words (examples will be
given in the following section),and reinterpreted idioms and archaisms
(e.g.,see example no.19).Therefore,popular expressions represent the
modern cultural iteration of the Chinese language; unlike traditional
expressions,which are concerned with monoculturalism,popular expressions
reflect the multiculturalism of today’s China (e.g.,loanwords,internet
memes,dialects and colloquialism).In the following section,the
effectiveness of using popular expressions in the translation of film
subtitles will be presented in relation to the 15 animated films by
comparing them with direct translations and highlighting the application
of any specific translation strategies.My observations concerning the
examples are intended to verify the positive function of the use of
popular expressions in the given data.</p>
<p>① 00:07:19,410 to 00:07:21,240</p>
<p>Very funny.Real mature.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>好笑。有够成熟。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Very funny.Mature enough.(Back translation)</p>
<p>非常有趣。真的成熟。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Very funny.Real mature.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Rio 1,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： Two popular expressions are found in the released
translation.One is the translation for the first sentence.In oral
Chinese，“好笑” means very funny or interesting.Compared with the direct
translation，although “非常有趣” looks more symmetrical in structure，it
involves a more serious tone of voice，unlike “好笑”，which sounds more
relaxed and informal.Moreover，when considering the ideal length，the
released translation is 50% shorter than the direct one.The other use of
popular expression is “有够”： compared with “好笑”，this expression
does not originally emanate from oral Chinese language； rather it is
believed that this expression comes from the language customs of
Cantonese and means “very”.It is a tendency that some expressions in
Cantonese have been integrated into Mandarin after the pro-reform
policies introduced in China since 1978.With more and more communication
between Hong Kong and mainland China，including Hong Kong films being
distributed on the mainland，it has become fashionable for mainland
Chinese to imitate the language customs of Cantonese and integrate them
into their daily language because of the humour and wit they
contain.Therefore，this kind of loaned expression has become part of
modern Chinese language.To this extent，the use of the popular
expression “有够” in the translated subtitle does indeed make the
translation more interesting than its direct translation.</p>
<p>② 00:07:40,400 to 00:07:41,420</p>
<p>Classy.(Original translation)</p>
<p>亮瞎。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Too shiny to look at it directly.(Back translation)</p>
<p>非常漂亮。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Very pretty.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Rio 1,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： This example also comes from Rio 1，which is the film
that has the highest frequency of using popular expressions among the 15
selected.Furthermore，the subtitler of Rio 1 gives the impression that
using humorous popular expressions is their style of translating.“亮瞎”
literally means “bright” or “blinding”.The indicated meaning of this
word is similar to the English expression about something or someone
being too bright，even blinding，to look at directly.However，in modern
Chinese，this kind of exaggerated description is always used to praise
the beautiful physical appearance of someone or something，with “亮瞎”
regarded as the highest level of describing beauty.Therefore，“亮瞎”
will make the receiver happier than “非常漂亮”.In addition，in common
with the above example，although “非常漂亮” is symmetrical in
structure，“亮瞎” has the advantage of being 50% shorter in length.</p>
<p>③ 00:10:16,826 to 00:10:18,202</p>
<p>Awesome! (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>哇，帅呆了！（Released translation）</p>
<p>Wow,so handsome that it makes me dumbfounded! (Back translation)</p>
<p>（这一球）太帅了！（Direct translation）</p>
<p>(This shoot) is rock! (Back translation)</p>
<p>④00:10:24,333 to 00:10:26,752</p>
<p>Busted.Time to go.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>妈妈生气了。快闪。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Mum is angry.Quickly go.(Back translation)</p>
<p>妈妈生气了。该走了。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Mum is angry.Time to go.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Rio 2,2014)</p>
<p>Observations： Compared with the former example，if “亮瞎” is
generally used to describe a girl who is beautiful，“帅呆” in this
example，as a relative expression，can be normally used to describe a
boy who is handsome.Furthermore，the use of “呆” indicates that he is
“so handsome that it makes me dumbfounded”.In the specific subtitle，it
refers to the highest possible praise one can give to someone who scores
a goal in a ball game.</p>
<p>In Example 4，the subtitler uses another popular expression in the
translation of “time to go”： “快闪” （“快” means to be quick or
fast，while “闪” means to leave quickly or in a flash）.The indicated
meaning of “快闪” not only means “go quickly” but also that someone did
something wrong in order to avoid being punished，that is，they escaped
quickly.As this indicated meaning is relevant to the given context in
this film，the use of this popular expression is effective in conveying
this indication to the audience.Generally，it is supposed that the Rio
film series continues the translation style involving humour by using
these kinds of popular expression.</p>
<p>⑤ 00:06:01,018 to 00:06:05,114</p>
<p>La la la la la la,this is so wrong! (Original translation)</p>
<p>啦啦啦啦啦，这有点不靠谱！（Released translation）</p>
<p>La la la la la la,this is not reliable! (Back translation)</p>
<p>啦啦啦啦啦，这有点不对劲！（Direct translation）</p>
<p>La la la la la la,this is so wrong! (Back translation)</p>
<p>(The Smurfs 1,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： “不靠谱” in Chinese originally refers to an
instrumentalist who is so skilled that they do not need to refer to any
musical score when performing.The last character is the core word in
this expression，meaning “musical score”.However，the first word “不”
involves the privative meaning “no”，while “靠” is a shortened version
of the expression “依靠”，meaning “rely on”.But，in today’s Chinese，the
meaning of the core character “谱” in the term “不靠谱” has been changed
into “reliable”，while the remaining two characters retain their
original meaning.Therefore，the current meaning of the term “不靠谱” is
unreliable or unrealistic.In this specific subtitle，as the speaker
thinks something is not right，he says，“This is so wrong！” The
subtitler has translated “wrong” as “不靠谱” for one of two reasons：
one is that this expression is found in colloquial language in Chinese
and refers to the speaker’s sceptical attitude towards something； the
other is that，compared with the direct translation，“不对劲”，which
also involves a negative attitude towards something，and is also a
colloquial expression，“不靠谱” also shows the speaker’s despicable or
reckless attitude.In the context of the film，although the evil wizard
is the smurfs’ enemy，the brave smurfs are unafraid of his
threat.Hence，in order to highlight this motif，“不靠谱” is more
relevant.</p>
<p>⑥ 00:21:45,879 to 00:21:50,724</p>
<p>No.No! Oh,my goodness! Oh,my gosh! (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>不，不，噢，天哪！噢，我的神啊！（Released translation）</p>
<p>No.No! Oh,my goodness! Oh,my god! (Back translation)</p>
<p>噢，不，不，天哪！噢，天哪！（Direct translation）</p>
<p>No.No! Oh,my goodness! Oh,my gosh! (Back translation)</p>
<p>(The Smurfs 1,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： In this example，the expressions “my goodness” and “my
gosh” both indicate a sigh of emotion on the speaker’s part； there is
almost no difference between them.Similarly，in Chinese，“天哪” and
“我的神啊” share the same meaning.Therefore，it is confirmed that，in
the direct translation，the translation of “天哪” appears
twice.However，the subtitler of the released translation has chosen
“我的神啊”，rather than to use the same term twice with two layers of
intention： that is，to avoid repetition by using synonyms to explain
one meaning in one subtitle，and that “我的神啊” is a popular catch
phrase from a well-known 2006 television series，My Own Swordsman，in
China.The leading protagonist’s pet phrase is “我的神啊”： people felt
that this expression sounded funny when the protagonist concerned utters
it to show all her sighs of emotion in her dialect，such that more and
more people begin to imitate her by using this expression in their daily
communications.The subtitler arguably uses this expression in order to
make audiences experience more fun in this film.</p>
<p>⑦ 00:28:49,677 to 00:28:51,054</p>
<p>Over here! Get him! (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>快来！搞定他！（Released translation）</p>
<p>Over here! Defeat him! (Back translation)</p>
<p>快来！打倒他！（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Over here! Beat him up! (Back translation)</p>
<p>(The Smurfs 1,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： This is one more example，which is selected from The
Smurfs 1，whereby the subtitler of this film built up their translation
style by using this kind of popular expression in order to make it
amusing and engaging.“搞定” represents a new type of colloquial language
in Mandarin used by young people.This term originates from a slang form
of Cantonese，which indicates approval of the speaker when they
accomplish something thought of as difficult or big.On some
occasions，“to搞定somebody” indicates that the speaker believes their
opponent is weak such that they look down on their opponent’s
ability，saying “to搞定them” （to defeat them easily）.In this specific
translated subtitle，this kind of indication exists.Therefore，“搞定”
shows more confidence than the use of “打倒” in the direct
translation.</p>

<p>Look on the bright side Zuba.After I defeat you and take over as
alpha lion,(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar 2,2009)</p>
<p>Observations： In this example，“瞧瞧” is representative of a typical
vernacular phrase in Chinese.The difference between written form and
colloquial form of some verbs，such as “看” （to look），“听” （to
listen），“说” （to say） and “闻” （to smell），is solely used as
written language （e.g.，“看”）； verbs as oral language are repeatedly
used （e.g.，“看看”： see Examples b and c）.In the released
translation，the repeated character of “瞧瞧” is synonymous with
“看看”，both of which mean “to have a look” or “to see”.Moreover，when
comparing“瞧瞧” with “看看”，the former is even more informal than the
latter in terms of tone of voice.As we know，film subtitles mostly
involve the dialogue that happens among characters； therefore，when
translating foreign films into Chinese，this kind of typical Chinese
vernacular phrase is inevitable.Besides，another kind of formation of
this type of Chinese vernacular phrase could be a general form in the
translation into Chinese： “瞧一瞧” or “看一看”.There could be one more
character “一” （one） in between the two repeated characters.Although
this kind of formation is common and acceptable in oral Chinese，when it
comes to film subtitle translations，the shorter the translation，the
better choice in most cases.</p>
<p>⑨ 00:03:01,430 to 00:03:03,760</p>
<p>Hi.Holy moly.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>嗨。我的亲娘哎。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Hi.My biological mother.(Back translation)</p>
<p>嗨。我的天啊。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Hi.Holy moly.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(The Smurfs 2,2013)</p>
<p>Observations： In the released translation，the subtitler uses the
popular expression “我的亲娘”，which comes from the collection of
popular expressions selected from the 2011 CCTV Spring Festival Gala
（www.hinews.cn/news/system/2011/02/03/011964099.shtml）.Popular
expressions，which appear in every CCTV Spring Festival Gala，are
collected and presented in multimedia formats via the Internet and text
messages to smartphones to people.It has become fashionable in China to
use these kinds of expression.Typically，these popular expressions from
the afore-mentioned gala are generally humorous and witty，complemented
by exaggerated performances，which leave a deep impression on
audiences.According to the investigation into the data，I found that the
use of such popular expressions also appears in other selected films
（more examples will be given in the latter section of this
chapter）.</p>

<p>Hey friends,thanks.(Back translation)</p>
<p>谢谢大家。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Thanks everyone.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar 1,2005)</p>
<p>Observations： In this film series，because the main characters —
such as Alex （the lion） and Marty （the zebra） — appear in the first
to the third instalments，the way they refer to each other and their
styles of speaking persist as well.Therefore，in the three
instalments，the same translation “伙计” appears in the released
translation.This is worth recommending to the future subtitler of any
film series，because this is an effective strategy to provide audiences
of the first instalment with a reassuring，familiar continuity as they
watch the subsequent instalments.From the perspective of
psychology，people will find it easier to accept what is familiar，as a
manifestation of continuity，as opposed to encountering
unsettling，unfamiliar phenomena.Furthermore，“伙计” was originally used
to describe a partner or an employee of a private company in olden
times.Now，it has become an oral expression，which is mainly used in
Northern China，mostly among male friends.It is an appropriate
translation of the concerned film subtitles because the main roles，Alex
and Marty，are respectively a male lion and a male zebra in this film
series.This explains the function and degree to which they call each
“brothers”； “伙计” shows a close relationship among male friends.For
female friends，they also use two specific expressions to show their
close friendship： “姐妹” （sisters） and “闺蜜” （bosom female
friends）.In modern Chinese，“伙计” and “闺蜜” are more popular than
“兄弟” and “姐妹” when used to show the relations among young people.In
recent years，people have even invented another new
word，namely，“男闺蜜” （male bosom friend），to describe a close
friendship between a boy and a girl.Their relationship belongs to the
degree of being closer than common friends，but less than couples.These
appellations represent a culture and the accompanying language custom of
a certain era.Therefore，when these expressions are used in film
subtitle translations，they symbolize the language custom of the
specific era.</p>
<p>00:05:13,390 to 00:05:16,140</p>
<p>Yeah,they’re probably bored out of their minds! (Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>没错，可能他们正无聊到爆呢！（Released translation）</p>
<p>Exactly,they probably feel extremely bored! (Back translation)</p>
<p>是的，他们很可能无聊得发狂呢！（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Yeah,they’re probably bored out of their minds! (Back
translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar 3,2012)</p>
<p>Observations： The two underlined expressions share the same meaning
in English，that is，they mean “bored out of their minds”.However，in
“无聊到爆”，the literal meaning of the last character，“爆”，is
“explode”； here，in this specific sentence，it means that the degree of
boredom felt by the speaker is at the extreme； furthermore，“爆”，as a
popular expression，means that somebody’s mood or emotion is approaching
the most extreme.This belongs to a kind of exaggerated description in
Chinese.Young people prefer to use these kinds of exaggerated expression
in their language； similar expressions were also discussed in
previously observed examples，such as “亮瞎” （extremely beautiful） and
“帅呆” （extremely handsome）.In the direct
translation，however，“无聊得发狂” is considered as translating every
word of the original expression more equally，although the tone of voice
when using “无聊得发狂” is weaker than “无聊到爆”.</p>

<p>(Madagascar 2,2009)</p>
<p>Observations： In the above example，the subtitler uses two popular
expressions in the translation.These two expressions belong to new
colloquial words found in Chinese； their prototypes are “英俊”
（handsome） and “时髦，新潮” （stylish）（in this context，it
specifically refers to a hair style）.Compared with these two written
forms，the use of “帅” and “酷” more often appear in oral language and
are briefer.</p>

<p>我还是觉得他太炫耀了。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>I still think he is kind of a show off.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar 2,2009)</p>
<p>Observations： The use of “显摆” involves dialect from Northern China
and has become widely used in colloquial language in modern
Chinese，usually to describe somebody who always sings their own
praises.In the direct translation，“炫耀” is the written and formal
expression of“show off”.Both of these expressions in Chinese are
negative words,in common with the original function of the phrase in
English.</p>

<p>醒醒！太阳都升起来了！（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Wake up! Rise and shine! (Back translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar 1,2005)</p>
<p>Observations： In the released translation of this subtitle，the
subtitler uses a well-known Chinese phrase，“太阳晒屁股啦”.It is a
humorous way to persuade someone to get up quickly because it is nearly
late morning.In oral communication，this expression is usually used by
parents to their children.</p>

<p>哇噢。难道你不是一道小阳光？（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Wow.Aren’t you just a little ray of sunshine? (Back translati on)</p>
<p>(Turbo,2013)</p>
<p>Observations： At first，from the direct translation，it can clearly
be seen that the subtitler of the released translation uses free
translation to explain the real meaning of the sentence.If the direct
translation had been used，the audience may have felt confused or
experienced difficulty in understanding this subtitle.Secondly，the
released translation of this subtitle uses an ironic tone of voice in
order to strengthen the speaker’s unpleasant reaction to the former
comment towards her from others.According to the context，someone shows
a negative attitude of the main character Turbo towards a snail’s
participation in a racing competition.He does not believe a snail can
win the race.Therefore，when he utters some negative words when asking
Turbo to give up the race，Turbo responds by using this sentence.In
Chinese，it is a custom to use a reversing expression to protest against
others’ negative or unsporting attitude.Therefore，although
“你真会说话啊” means “you are really putting in a good word for me”，its
real meaning is “you are not really saying anything good about me” or
“you are not really encouraging me”.In addition，because this is a kind
of ironic expression to show people’s unhappiness or dissatisfaction
about someone else’s words，in Chinese，it always ends with an
exclamation rather than a question mark.However，in this specific
example，in order to follow the original context，the subtitler
continues with the use of a question mark in their translation.</p>

<p>我们快死了！（Direct translation）</p>
<p>We’re going to die! (Back translation)</p>
<p>(Alpha and Omega,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： In the released translation，the use of “完蛋” is an
oral expression meaning “to die”.In Chinese，since “死” is a taboo
word，people are all afraid of facing death； they create varied
expressions to indicate this direct word.As in English，“to die” also
has its euphemistic alternatives： “to pass away” or “to go to
heaven”.The equivalences of these two euphemistic expressions in Chinese
are “去世” （formal word） and “上天堂” （for good people，while
“下地狱” is used for bad people，as it means “go to hell”）.</p>

<p>我刚刚在想什么呢？（Direct translation）</p>
<p>What was I thinking? (Back translation)</p>
<p>(Alpha and Omega,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： “大脑短路” is a humorous way to dismiss someone’s
sudden thoughts.Compared with the direct translation，“大脑短路” can
explain the indicated meaning of this speaker； however，the direct
translation is not able to convey this indication.Therefore，this is an
effective translation of the specific subtitle.</p>

<p>这就是你花钱让我带你来的那个地方。（Direct translation）Right where
you paid me to bring you.（Back translation）</p>
<p>(Cars 2,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： The translation of “fire” is “解雇” （to dismiss
somebody from employment） in Chinese.This expression is formal and
usually used in formal documentation （e.g.，a contract） as written
language.However，in modern language，“炒鱿鱼” （“to fry cuttlefish” in
direct meaning，but “to fire somebody” in indication） is more informal
and humorous.In this released translation （Example 18），the subtitler
uses the abbreviated expression “炒鱿鱼”，“炒”，because this expression
is more often used in oral Chinese.Then，in the final series of Season
2，I found the antonym of the expression “炒”： “雇” （to hire，to
employ）.The formal form of this expression in written Chinese is
“雇用”； in the released translation （Example 19），the use of
“雇”，same as the use of “炒”，is more informal and often used in oral
Chinese.</p>

<p>This time,I’m going to make sure you stay dead! (Back

<p>(Cars 2,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： Generally，the translation of Cars 2 is found to be
humorous with many exaggerated expressions，such as “为他骄傲得要死”
（meaning the highest degree of feeling proud of someone），“爽翻天”
（meaning something is so good that it makes people feel crazy） and
“死彻底” （its literal meaning is “to die thoroughly”，while，in the
given film context，this expression means “to make sure someone has no
chance of winning a race”）.However，the use of this expression
highlights the speaker’s exaggerated attitude towards making opponents
fail.Usually，these exaggerated descriptions are used in oral Chinese in
order to strengthen the speaker’s tone of voice and show their strong
emotion.In English，the equivalence of this kind of expression is “dead
+ adjective” or even “damned + adjective”.</p>

<p>任何新事物都不好，好奇心也不好。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Anything new is bad.Curiosity is bad.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(The Croods,2013)</p>
<p>Observations： From the back translation of the released
translation，it is clear that the subtitler uses a well-known Western
saying to translate the second sentence，“curiosity killed the cat”；
“好奇害死猫” is the word-for-word translation for this saying.As in the
previous observations regarding certain examples，I concluded that
absorbing various foreign language terms into modern Chinese suggests
language development tendency.There should be a certain number of
Chinese people who are interested in Western literature and know this
saying very well.However，“好奇害死猫” has become popular because of the
film entitled as《好奇害死猫》 （Curiosity Kills the Cat）（2006）.This
film enjoyed strong box office receipts while the leading actress
received a nomination in the 2006 Golden Horse Awards （one out of the
three highest awards among Chinese film competitions）.With the
popularity of this film，“好奇害死猫” has become a popular expression in
Chinese people’s daily communication.Moreover，the subtitler also
considers the balance of the two sentences in this subtitle，making
their translation of these two sentences symmetrical in structure，as
well as rhyming when reading.</p>

<p>I’ve had an offer of employment elsewhere.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>别人向我抛来了橄榄枝。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Someone else threw me the olive branch.(Back translation)</p>
<p>别家给我发来了工作机会。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>I’ve had an offer of employment elsewhere.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Despicable Me 2,2014)</p>
<p>Observations： The released translation used “抛来了橄榄枝” to
describe receiving an offer of employment.This is also a kind of loan
expression，which is used according to a new definition in modern
Chinese.This expression originates from a Western Bible story，in which
the green colour of the olive branch means “life” and the olive branch
symbolizes “hope”.Normally，extending an olive branch to someone or some
country refers to “to seek peaceful relations with each
other”.However，in modern Chinese，there is one more indication，which
is to give a job opportunity to somebody.Compared with the direct
translation，the use of “抛来了橄榄枝” to describe receiving a job
opportunity means that the receiver probably feels satisfied with this
potential job and feels happy about the salary and other conditions.</p>

<p>I don’t care.Beat it! (Original subtitle)</p>

<p>I don’t care.Get out of here! (Back translation)</p>
<p>我不管。走开！（Direct translation）</p>
<p>I don’t care.Beat it! (Back translation)</p>
<p>(Despicable Me 1,2010)</p>
<p>Observations： Strictly speaking，the expression of “滚” is a kind of
taboo expression in film translation，which the subtitler is better off
avoiding.However，the use of this word can appropriately indicate the
speaker’s personality.As previously introduced by this film，the leading
role Gru is man who “has villainy in his blood” （cited from Dru’s line
in Despicable Me 3，2017），who is unfriendly to others.When the girls
introduce themselves，and try to sell cockles to him，he simply replies
that he does not care about them and rudely asks them to quickly leave
his front door.Therefore，the speaker’s strongest tone of voice and
ruthless attitude could only be indicated by using such an unpleasant
expression.</p>

<p>夏日大甩卖。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Big summer big sale.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Frozen,2014)</p>
<p>Observations： In the released translation，the use of “跳楼大甩卖”
is a kind of exaggeration，since the word-for-word meaning of this
expression is the breakdown price that forces the owner to leap to their
death.It is known that a businessman is always smarter than the
customers： they know the real bottom price of their selling products；
the so-called “breakdown” price is never the real breakdown price，while
the purpose of labelling like this is to gain a good sale.But the use of
this kind of exaggerated expression in the film subtitle makes an
audience experience more fun than with regard to its direct
translation.</p>

<p>Dear customer,that’s no good.See…(Back translation)</p>
<p>亲爱的顾客，这可不好。明白吗……（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Dear customer,that’s no good.See…(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Frozen,2014)</p>
<p>Observations： “客官” is a polite way of addressing customers in the
style of Chinese archaisms.However，I categorize this expression in this
specific subtitle as a form of popular expression because，in modern
Chinese，especially among young people，using ancient forms of address
is preferred，rather than the corresponding modern terms，in order to
make something sound amusing.In this released translation，the subtitler
is regarded as having this kind of intention in their translation as
well.In order to attract a bigger audience，especially from among the
main consumers of translated animation films，that is，young
people，imitating their language custom is a necessary
strategy.However，the subtitler should be aware of this style when
applying it to the whole film translation to ensure consistency and
integrity.</p>
<p>All in all,with the observations concerning the corpus data of the 15
selected films,the researcher found that the use of different types of
popular expression in subtitle translations is inevitable.These
expressions make the data more humorous in terms of language and more
impressive in terms of current Chinese culture.As a rapidly developing
country,China has become open and multicultural; the language tendency
reflects this change by embodying the following popular expression
formats: 1) vernacular phrases or dialects,e.g.,Cantonese; 2) new
definition of old terms; 3) loan phrases from different cultures
e.g.,Japanese; 4) Internet language (including those taken from popular
films,television series,famous people’s remarks and the CCTV Spring
Festival Gala); 5) the exaggerated way of using expressions in Chinese
(including using taboo terms).However,these varied and colourful
expressions make the modern Chinese language more popular; when these
typical expressions,which embody the new era in China,are used in
translated films,they define the era depicted by these
films.Currently,in some Chinese universities,film translation has become
part of the curriculum for English major students.For these
students,translation using popular and traditional expressions may help
them to better understand the development of Chinese,the development of
E-C translation and the development of China.</p>
<p>However,using each traditional expression or popular Internet
expression in E-C subtitling is not a “go as you please” process;
subtitlers should consider if his use of these sometimes peculiar
expressions is technically and reasonably correct and
acceptable.Therefore,the consideration and selection of appropriate
translation strategies which can help to convey these expressions are
justified.</p>
