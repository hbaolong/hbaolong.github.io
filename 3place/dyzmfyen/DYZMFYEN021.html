<h4 id="avt-study-in-china">2.5.3　AVT Study in China</h4>
<p>Compared with the development of Literary Translation in China,the
study of AVT has not historically been a major branch in translation
studies because of the aforementioned reasons.No systemic theories have
been constructed as a result.However,in the short history of the
development of AVT study in China,three leading figures are worthy of
introduction.</p>
<p>Qian has over 1，000 AVT works to his name as a translation
practitioner.Many of his works are well known in China，such as for the
popular American TV series Growing Pains and The Thorn Birds.In 2000，he
published an article entitled《影视翻译——翻译园地中愈来愈重要的领域》
（“AVT study： Its growing importance within translation studies”）.He
stated that the translation of film is an important and creative
activity.It is not only a means of exhibiting foreign cultures but a
direct way of introducing local culture to the world.Translators ought
to take the cultural elements，film industry values，audience
psychology，and social effect into consideration.In order to bring about
an equivalent translation，they need to be faithful to the original
content，and fully understand the inherent cultural differences.</p>
<p>Appealing to relevant scholars and practitioners to put more effort
into the study of AVT,his article concluded that there are five features
of language in AVT products;
namely,comprehensive,audio,instantaneous,informal and non-annotated.At
first,AVT products should be regarded as comprehensive works of
arts,because an audience can obtain both audio and visual
information.Secondly,AVT products differ from literary works given the
audio features involved.Thirdly,because subtitles and dialogue emerge on
the screen instantaneously,the translated subtitles should be equally
instantaneous as well.Next,audiences have to comprehend immediately if
the verbal language in AVT products is instantaneous.Consequently,it
makes the language in AVT informal in its expression.In other words,the
subtitle translation should be simple and easily understood by the
average audience.Last but not least,in contrast to literary
translation,AVT translation cannot be annotated because of its time and
spatial constraints.</p>
<p>Moreover,informed by his rich experience as a translation
practitioner,he drew attention to seven features of translation
technique in this article.The first is to help audiences work out
objectively; the second is to emphasize the synchronism of the subtitles
and actors’ lip movements; the third is to make subtitles match film
pictures,with translators encouraged to introduce a pause in subtitles
if there is a pause in any character’s dialogue; the fourth is that
translators need to consider whether it is necessary to include an
annotation in instances involving non-verbal language,such as gestures
by the actors; the fifth is that translators have to make sure their
translation is an equal transfer in terms of both language and culture;
the sixth is that translators have to think about difficult language
points,such as puns and jokes; and,finally,the seventh is that the
translated version should be simple and easily understood by the average
audience.Amongst the translation principles of
“faithfulness,comprehensiveness and aesthetics” (Yan,1898 cited in Zhang
2009: 64),Qian has stated that “comprehensiveness” is the most important
criterion for him,because the readable information from the translated
subtitles is the main concern of the audience.</p>
<p>More recently，scholars have discussed Qian’s definitions of AVT
language features more widely and deeply.These include Du who wrote a
chapter entitled “影视翻译的特殊性” （“The Specialty of AVT”） in his
（2013） book，《基础影视翻译与研究》 （Basic AVT Study）； and，Zhang
in the （2011）
article《影视语言的特点及〈爱丽丝梦游仙境〉中文配音翻译赏析》 （“AVT
language features and an analysis on the dubbing of Alice’s Adventures
in Wonderland”）.Some scholars have considered Qian’s seven features of
technique in relation to their own study areas； for example，Zhang’s
（2013） article，《中外电影英文字幕的翻译的异同分析》 （“The difference
between Chinese and English subtitle translation”），emphasized the
importance of cultural awareness in AVT works in his explanation of
Qian’s seven features of practical techniques.He discussed the highly
frequent use of Skopos，functionalism，or other types of
“audience-centred” theories as representing the mainstream in AVT study
in China.He also suggested that the strategies of direct
translation，free translation and condensation are effective in the
context of AVT.While I agree with “audience-centred” theories，compared
with Even-Zohar’s polysystem theory，the latter is more considerate to
the various influence factors of AVT products （this theory will be
discussed in more detail in the later part of this chapter as the
theoretical framework of this study）.</p>
<p>Overall,Qian’s five features of AVT language and seven practical
techniques have offered a younger generation of scholars an invaluable
foundation on which to build their own study.</p>
<p>Ma’s specialism is translation and intercultural communications
studies.He has nearly 30 years’ experience as a practitioner in
AVT.Amongst his practical works，his translation for programs such as
“正大剧场” （“Zhengda Theatre”） and “国际影院” （“International Film
Theatre”） on CCTV，as well as his translations for over 50 TV series
（about 600 episodes in total） helped him win the “Feitian Prize”，a
competition for dubbed films.In 1997，he published an article called
《论影视翻译的基本原则》 （“A discussion on the basic features of AVT”）
in his university’s academic journal.In this article，Ma listed five
basic features of AVT based on his professional knowledge and extensive
practical experience.The five features are： colloquial，personalized
verbal language，emotional，lip-sync and popular.Moreover，in another
article （2003），he re-emphasized these five features in a deeper way
by referring to copious practical examples.</p>
<p>In 2011，12 out of 78 articles were focused on the perspective of
cultural awareness.In her article published in 《时代文学》 （Times
Literature），under the title of《影视翻译的跨文化探析》 （“The study of
audiovisual translation from the perspective of intercultural
study”），from the perspective of intercultural communication，she
defined the concept of “Intercultural Interpretation” as a means by
which to use relevant methods and theories in the study of intercultural
communication to solve difficulties in AVT.The main concerns in her
study are the importance of equivalent “information transfer” between
the source and target languages，and the use of the “target
audiencecentred” translation method.Hu regarded “translation” as a kind
of intercultural activity，stating that language，culture，and
translation are three elements that cannot be separated.I agree with
this opinion and believe that these three elements are the essentials of
subtitle translation.Moreover，in this article，Hu talked about the main
features of film language as being colloquial，simple and
characterized，cultural，partial，and limits in time and space.</p>
<p>The linguistic peculiarities in both the original language and the
target language should be studied in the first instance.For
Ma,conclusions about film language features are made more from the
perspective of mechanic considerations,while Hu emphasizes the need for
more awareness of cultural components.In this study,since the focus is
on language and culture,Hu’s conclusion needs to be explained in more
detail.In my understanding,these features can be explained as in the
following:</p>
<p>Colloquial</p>
<p>Most films focus on telling a story through a series of interactions
involving the main characters.The interactions are always conducted
through dialogue.Therefore,the language within the dialogue is commonly
recognized as colloquial in its expression.</p>
<p>Simplicity</p>
<p>As most communication is by colloquial language,language in common
narrative films should be simple and easy to comprehend.</p>
<p>Characterization</p>
<p>With different roles and characters in a film,the manner of spoken as
well as non-verbal languages (e.g.,body language) may
differ.Therefore,performances may vary according to the difference in
characterization,including use of language.</p>
<p>Culture</p>
<p>Cultural elements may appear anywhere in a film,and language is a key
conduit for the communication of culturally significant information
(Kramsch 1998: 35).</p>
<p>Partiality</p>
<p>Film translation normally appears in the form of subtitles or
dubbing.In both these forms,language transfer is part of the process
that has to be brought together with the movie pictures,voicing and
other elements before the full translated product can be presented to
the audience.</p>
<p>Limits in Time and Space</p>
<p>As subtitles cannot be isolated by other components in a film
product,they are limited by time and space constraints.On the one
hand,they cannot remain in a fixed place in the same way as the words in
a book or other printed literature.When the image or setting in a given
film sequence changes,the subtitles should unavoidably be changed – that
is the nature of their temporal aspect.Similar to this,the nature of a
subtitle’s spatial aspect also needs to be considered when the
translator determines the length of each piece of translated
subtitle.</p>
<p>In June 2005，Ma published the book《影视译制概论》 （The Theory of
Audiovisual Translation） with the help of his university publishing
house.In this book，which is considered to be an important work in the
area of AVT study within China in recent years，Ma analysed the essence
of AVT，explained the concept of translated films and discussed the
nature of translated films and their meanings in relation to
sociocultural development.He further stated in this book his
understanding of the principles of film translation，as well as offering
solutions to some of the problems that occurred in his practical
experience.From the perspectives of Communication，the second coding
theory，Semiology，Hermeneutics，and Aesthetics，amongst others，Ma
offered his various criticisms and analyses of the theory of AVT.</p>
<p>Building on Ma’s five AVT principles,postgraduate students and other
young scholars have developed their own case studies in this subject
area.For instance,in his (2011) dissertation entitled Film Subtitle
Translation with the Perspective of Functionalism —A Case Study of Gong
Fu Panda,Zhang discussed the translation strategies used by the fansubs
(e.g.,expansion,explanation) and explained the benefits in using popular
Internet words and frequently used terms (hot words).As I presume that
these popular expressions are used in the released subtitle translation
as well,I will operationalize the chosen methodologies to test my
findings in the discussion and data analysis chapters.</p>
<p>Another leading figure in the area of AVT in China is Zhang，who
specializes in translation theories and practice and the study of AVT.He
has also been responsible for translating over 300 episodes of TV series
including 《神探亨特》 （Hunter），《欲望号街车》 （A Streetcar Named
Desire） and《安娜·卡列尼娜》 （Анна Каренина）.</p>
<p>In 1998，Zhang defined language in AVT as possessing two distinctive
features — instantaneous and popular — in his article entitled
《影视翻译初探》 （“The first exploration of AVT”），which was published
in the renowned academic journal，《中国翻译》 （Chinese Translators
Journal）.In this article，Zhang highlighted the differences between AVT
and literary translation，as well as explaining his understanding of the
nature，principles and techniques of AVT.In addition，he emphasized the
important role that cultural elements play in AVT and，by analysing
practical examples，discussed methods especially for translating
puns.</p>
<p>The younger generation of AVT scholars has often referred to Zhang’s
definition of AVT language features in their own research.One example
would be Zheng’s （2011） Master’s degree
dissertation，《从德国功能翻译理论探析电影字幕翻译》 （Film Subtitle
Translation from the Perspective of German Functionalism），in which she
combined the ideas of Zhang and Qian’s definition of AVT language
features，and located them within her discussion by analysing specific
examples.Taking the features of AVT language as her foundation，she
discussed translation strategies used from the perspective of German
Functionalism.According to her conclusion，AVT language features，such
as colloquial or instantaneous features，are inevitable given the
specific characteristics of AVT products.Translators should be vigilant
about the presence of these characteristics in their work in order to
ensure that every element of an AVT product is synchronized so that the
finished product is both accurate and acceptable to audiences.</p>
<p>The above three scholars have become well known in the area of AVT in
China as a consequence of their considerable experience as practitioners
and insights in AVT practice and research.More recent scholars have in
turn built their own research work on the foundations of these
pioneers，and in turn made their own unique contributions to the
discussion of AVT，its features and principles，in a broader and deeper
way.Li （2001） analysed the characteristics of subtitle translation and
identified relevant strategies in his published
article，《字幕翻译策略》 （“Subtitling strategies”）.Discussing his own
practical experience from the perspective of text translation theory，he
offered solutions for addressing the constraints on time and space in
AVT，and also emphasized the features of AVT language and the impact of
cultural factors in subtitle translation.In conclusion，he stated that
subtitle translation should offer the audience as much information as
effectively possible within the limited time and spatial conditions that
exist.</p>
<p>In Zhao’s article《译制片翻译中的四对主要矛盾》 （“Four pairs of
conflicts in translated movies”），she analysed a number of actual
practitioner experiences and concluded that there are four pairs of
conflict in AVT： 1） between the shape of the character’s mouth and the
context； 2） between the order of language speaking and the pictures；
3） foreignization and domestication； and，4） transliteration and free
translation.She offered her own solutions for solving these
problems，emphasizing the strategies of synchronization，coherence and
cultural images in the process.The first two conflicts in her study
belong to the category of mechanics and techniques，while the last two
conflicts refer to the translation methods and strategies that are
considered to be widely used in film translation.Other than the way in
which one language is translated into another，the method of
transferring one culture into another is also concerned.</p>
<p>Other scholars have focused their studies from other
perspectives,such as linguistics,translation studies and cultural
studies,such as Wang who in 2013 explored translation strategies for
jokes,slang,vulgarity,court language,figures etc.In the West,scholars
have also applied certain translation theories to the study of AVT.The
main theories are relevance theory,Skopos theory,descriptive translation
and interdisciplinary studies.The same is true in China,where scholars
have usually combined these theories and applied them to their research
into AVT.They have also focused on the discussion of Lefevere’s power
controlling theory and Venuti’s domestication theory (Gambier 2008:
25).For instance,Wang (2007) focused on the combination of Skopos theory
and functionalism in explaining the features of AVT.According to
Wang,translators ought to select the most useful information from the
original dialogue,and then translate it into the target language.This
suggestion first guides the subtitlers towards an understanding of the
original text so that they can then be in a position to select the
essential meaning of the original text,thereby expressing it in the
target language.Given the mechanical limitations of film subtitles,I
agree with this suggestion.However,decimation or deletion is not
applicable in film translation,since an extreme approach will render the
translation non-understandable.</p>
<p>Translation is regarded as “an act of intercultural communication
rather than simply inter-linguistic” (Cintas,in Orero ed.2004:
31).Through the social organization of talk,culture is constructed
across day-to-day dialogues; therefore,the term “cultural awareness” has
been defined as sensitivity to the impact of culturally-induced
behaviour on language use and communication (Kramsch 1998: 51; Tomalin
and Stempleski,1993: 5).When considering the translation of foreign
films,we may have to raise awareness of cultural information in order to
make the audience comprehend the movie appropriately.With this in
mind,the use of key analysed memes may help the film translators improve
the quality of their work.As a consequence,the researcher will focus on
the differences between Western and Chinese culture in my book with a
view to improving the accuracy in E-C subtitling films and effectiveness
in making the subtitles compatible in Chinese culture.</p>
<p>In the past few years,scholars have begun to study AVT from the
perspective of cultural studies.Foreign films,for example,as a carrier
of culture,have introduced target audiences to different cultures.In
response,some scholars have discussed the impact of cultural elements in
AVT work,while others have undertaken AVT research from the viewpoint of
intercultural communication.Zhao and Liu have instead focused on the
methods of subtitling,by analysing the use of literal translation,free
translation,and condensed translation,and explaining their effective
functions in translating languages and cultures present in film
dialogues.Chai (2001) has also discussed some techniques that can be
applied when dealing with cultural differences in subtitling,such as
rebuilding (to express the original in the subtitlers’ own words,to
transfer the original culture to the target culture by filling in the
cultural gaps); polishing (to modify the translated subtitle so that it
reflects accuracy of language and acceptability of culture) and
transferring (to successfully transfer languages and
cultures).Meanwhile,Gong (2008) has drawn attention to
condensation,literal translation,domestication and abstraction in
solving cultural transference problems.Increasing awareness of cultural
elements in subtitle translation is a study trend both in the West and
in China,which is a reflection of increasing globalization.The
strategies mentioned by Chai and Gong set up a clear framework for the
use of appropriate strategies in subtitle translation from the
perspective of cultural awareness.That said,they only proposed a very
limited number of strategies.</p>
<p>Although the study of AVT in China developed much later than in the
West,increasing numbers of Chinese scholars are now devoting themselves
to this study field,often following a certain degree of personal
achievement in both practical work and theoretical
systematizing.Although young Chinese scholars appreciate the
achievements made in both the West and China,the gap between China and
Western countries is still wide.The next step for the study of AVT in
China,then,should be the systematic construction of theories by Chinese
scholars,alongside the promotion of the study of AVT in a more
diversified and interdisciplinary way.In this research,I hope to
identify the features of subtitle translation in E-C animation films,as
well as discuss effective translation strategies.These contributions
will hopefully strengthen AVT study pursuits in China,at both a
theoretical and practical level.</p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2013，a keyword search for “audiovisual
translation/subtitling” conducted with the primary academic online
reference source in China，cnki.net，returned over 60 articles on this
subject in each of the last five years.Till this year，more and more
scholars （about 1，600 articles） have begun to study this subject in a
disciplinary way.For example，some scholars have undertaken their work
from the perspective of cultural difference or intercultural
communication.In 2012，there were 6 out of 64 papers on this
subject，while，in 2013，there were 12 out of 72 papers looking into
it.Other scholars have focused on the discussion of effective
translation strategies from the perspective of Reception
Aesthetics，Poetics，Psychology，or Ecological Aesthetics.In 2013，in
her article entitled《从接受美学的角度看影视字幕翻译》 （“The study of
audiovisual subtitle translation from the perspective of reception
aesthetics”），Wu pointed out that the target audience’s reception ought
to be at the centre of subtitle translation.Translators need to provide
the target audience with the same level of appreciation as that for the
source audience.Although the language preference of the receptors is a
key when evaluating the quality of a subtitle translation，it is not the
only criterion.Besides，the linguistic features of the translated
language，the receptor’s literacy level and the cultural difference are
all important factors in subtitle translation.The hypotheses established
in this study are mainly focused on all the above factors in order to
obtain more productive research results.Further，some scholars have
discussed their views on the translation of certain common Chinese
expressions，such as idioms and archaisms.As these expressions always
refer to ancient Chinese sayings or moral stories，I am minded that they
can embody traditional Chinese culture to some degree.Liu （2010）
states that Nord’s “function plus loyalty” theory is feasible in the
translation of Chinese archaisms.In her opinion，in the process of
translating archaisms，translators need to be aware of the
transformation of the source meaning.Although the case study in this
book focuses on E-C translation，I believe the idea of keeping the
original meaning in the course of translating is applicable in E-C
translation as well.Therefore，in my research，in the translation of E-C
subtitles involving the use of archaisms，I also need to make sure that
the original meaning in English is not changed.Cheng （2011） discusses
the use of Nida’s dynamic equivalence theory，Toury’s “translated
text-centred” theory，and Venuti’s foreignization and domestication in
the translation of Chinese idioms.In turn，she refers to the strategies
of literal translation，expansion，condensation，annotation in the
translation of Chinese idioms.In subtitle translations，however，in view
of the mechanical limits，literal translation and condensation may be
more appropriate than the other two methods （I will discuss this matter
in detail in the data analysis and discussion chapters）.</p>
