id="observations-on-the-used-strategies-and-popular-expressions">7.2.1　Observations
on the Used Strategies and Popular Expressions</h4>
<p>According to the collected data,in the 15 selected animated films,on
average,over 28% of subtitles are translated by using popular Internet
expressions.More specifically,in different situations and in order to
meet different needs,the subtitlers also used certain translation
strategies,such as localization,globalization and transfer,in order to
use popular expressions based on their own knowledge.In the following
pairs of subtitles,I explain the use of popular expressions in
details.</p>
<p>① 00:01:57,030 to 00:02:02,200</p>
<p>“I am making my own irresistible creation,the Smurfette.”</p>
<p>(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>“我要造一个属于自己的秘密武器，蓝妹妹。”</p>
<p>(Released translation)</p>
<p>“I will make my own secret weapon,Smurfette.” (Back translation)</p>
<p>“我要制造一个属于自己的别人不可抵御的创造发明，蓝妹妹。” （Direct
translation）</p>
<p>“I am creating my own secret weapon,the Smurfette.” (Back
translation)</p>
<p>(The Smurfs 2,2013)</p>
<p>Observation： As we can see，“秘密武器” in English means “secret
weapon”.Here，the subtitler translated the phrase as “irresistible
creation” by using the substitute word “秘密武器”.Taken in
context，“Smurfette” is essentially a weapon or tool that the wizard
originally created to catch the Smurf family.Therefore，the translation
of “武器” is positive.Furthermore，“秘密武器” is a more popular
expression than the direct translation of “irresistible
creation”，“不可抵御的创造/发明”.To compare these two
translations，people are more frequently used to the word “秘密武器”
when they describe something that will be revealed soon，so using this
word will be more attractive or of interest to the target audience.In
the film context，a Smurfette will be a unique character for the male
Smurfs in a family，as everyone will treat their younger sister
carefully and gently.Given her beautiful physical appearance （blonde
hair，tender characteristics），everyone in the Smurf family will accept
her unquestioningly，without reserve.In turn，the wizard will take
advantage of her in order to get to his own evil way.The subtitler used
“秘密武器” to fully convey this scenario to the audience.The strategy in
this particular translation of “秘密武器” is localization，because it
belongs to the daily vocabulary in today’s China.</p>
<p>I also noticed a further tendency,comparing the period before 2011
and the period after 2011.The translation of animation films in the last
10 years has seen a clear change,namely,that more recent films feature
popular language in networks in their translated subtitles.The
percentage of use of popular language in networks before 2011 was,on
average,26%; after 2011,it increased,on average,to 31%.</p>
<p>② 00:02:24,390 to00:02:25,980</p>
<p>She’s a Frankensmurf?</p>
<p>Yes.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>她是个科学怪精灵吗？（原词Frankenstein科学怪人）</p>
<p>没错。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Is she a maverick smurfette in science?</p>
<p>Yes.(Back translation)</p>
<p>她是科学怪才/作法自毙的人？</p>
<p>是的。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>She’s a Frankenstein/maverick genius in science.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>(The Smurfs 2,2013)</p>
<p>Observation： The translation strategies in this translated subtitle
is globalization，paraphrase and transfer.“Frankenstein” originally
referred to a distinguished scientist who created something deadly，with
the consequence that he killed himself with his creation.But，in
2004，the word “Frankenstein”，which was used as the title of a thriller
film，was translated as “科学怪人” in the Chinese version.Given the
popularity of this film，the original subtitle used transfer and
paraphrase to create the new word “Frankensmurf”.This is a new compound
word inspired by the recently released film.“Franken” is derived from
“Frankenstein”； when “smurf” is added，a new word “Frankensmurf” is
created，which is a more situational word in this film.The translator
understood the significance of the original subtitle，and he/she
consequently translated this word as “科学怪精灵”，as well as providing
a note to the audience to explain that the source of the word
“Frankensmurf” is “Frankenstein”.This is a more considerate translation
strategy as mentioned in the researcher’s earlier discussion.A note or
footnote can give more explanation or information to the reader or
audience.This is regarded as useful and effective in an AVT study
situation and can also be used in subtitling.But given the concerns
about the mechanical limits，the use of footnotes to explain concepts
that frequently occur in subtitling is not encouraged.However，in the
case of the above example，the researcher believes that it is
necessary.Audiences will quickly make sense of the word “科学怪精灵” due
to this judicious reminder.This word also exemplifies the effectiveness
of using popular language by the strategies of globalization paraphrase
and transfer.</p>
<p>③ 00:08:30,459 to 00:08:32,507</p>
<p>Time to smurf some magic.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>这是见证魔法的时刻。（Released translation）</p>
<p>It’s time to see the magic.(Back translation)</p>
<p>这是使用蓝精灵魔法的时间。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>It’s time to use smurf magic.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(The Smurfs 1,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： Chinese audiences know that the sentence pattern of
“见证……的时刻” became familiar from 2009 onwards，when a young magician
called Liu Qian appeared at the CCTV Spring Festival Gala.From that
year，his prologue in subsequent appearances at the Spring Festival Gala
has remained the same： “It’s time to see amazing things！” In
turn，this catchphrase has become popular.Here，the subtitler was
obviously influenced by this popular expression and translated “Time to
smurf some magic” by using the strategy of localization.</p>
<p>④ 00:07:15,410 to 00:07:19,210</p>
<p>Well,well,if it isn’t my favourite nerd bird.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>这可不是我最爱的宅鸟。（Released translation）</p>
<p>This is not what my favourite home bird.(Back translation)</p>
<p>唔，唔，这还是我最爱的那个呆鸟吗？（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Well,well,if it is my favourite nerd bird? (Back translation)</p>
<p>(Rio 1,2011)</p>
<p>Observation： In Chinese，the original equivalent of “nerd” is
“呆子”，which is similar to the expression to describe someone who “lags
in response” or “only focuses on his/her own study or other
business，but with no response to other things”.“宅”，in popular
language，means someone who “prefers to stay at home，not take part in
any outdoor activities”.This kind of person is called “宅男宅女”，which
means “male and female nerd”.This popular expression was introduced in
2008，which is originally comes from Japanese，belongs to loan word.In
some instances，“宅” is negative word，showing the speaker’s scornful
attitude.In most situations，however，this is a neutral word，which
simply explains someone’s lifestyle.The subtitler，when translating
“nerd bird” as “宅鸟”，may have sought two layers of meanings.One would
be to show that this character is introverted，then to convey this layer
of meaning，the use of “宅” is localization； while the other layer of
meaning to “宅鸟” would be to show that the character is something of a
narrow minded bird，who is more like a pet rather than a wild avian
（one example to verify this estimation or this indication that exists
in the film is the character，Blu，who is a scarlet macaw who is unable
to fly in the beginning of the film），therefore，this layer of meaning
is displayed by the strategy of transfer，and coincidently，in
Chinese，“宅” as a popular adjective word，also has the meaning of
“disjointed from the same kind”.Therefore，given these two
indications，the use of “宅” is better than “呆”.And because of the
modern meaning of “宅” in current Chinese language，the use of this
popular expression is more interesting than the direct translation of
“呆” with the strategy of localization.</p>
<p>⑤ 00:10:00,970 to 00:10:04,460</p>
<p>It was very nice of you to stop in and squawk around.(Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>谢谢你跑来说鸟话。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to speak bird’s language.(Back translation)</p>
<p>你真好，能来制止一切还有在这儿乱叫。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>It’s very nice of you to stop in and squawk around.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>(Rio 1,2011)</p>
<p>Observation： “说鸟话” in Chinese popular colloquial language firstly
means “to speak birds’ language”，which is to say that someone knows how
to communicate with birds.However，in its second meaning，the most
frequently used meaning in real life，it is not a complimentary
word，because it means “talk nonsense”.According to the film
context，the subtitler cleverly used this dual connotation to not only
translate the meaning of the expression，but also to effectively express
the real mood of the speaker.The use of strategies in this translation
is also localization and transfer as the above example of 4.</p>
<p>⑥ 00:17:44,971 to 00:17:46,436</p>
<p>You’re gorgeous.Wait,what? (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>你看起来帅呆了。等等，我在说什么？（Released translation）</p>
<p>You look so handsome.Wait,what am I saying? (Back Translation)</p>
<p>你真帅。等等，什么？（Direct translation）</p>
<p>You are so handsome.Wait,what? (Back translation)</p>
<p>(Frozen,2013)</p>
<p>Observation： “帅” is an adjective to describe someone who is very
handsome or someone’s behaviour，actions or words as wonderful.As this
concerns praise or admiration，it is a complimentary word.In the film
context，this word can express the original meaning of
“gorgeous”.Moreover，“帅” plus “呆了” corresponds to another phrase in
Chinese，“酷毙了”.Both of these phrases can also take the form of short
sentences； however，the functions are the same.“呆了” and “毙了” are
used after an adjective in order to strengthen the degree of the
speaking voice.A similar meaning in English is “so，very，or
extremely”.The form of “an adjective +呆了/毙了” is a popular language
form among young people.They prefer to use this word formation in their
oral communication in online chat rooms as well as in daily
life.Therefore，by using this formation in subtitling with localization
strategy，the subtitler can make the film more meaningful and verbally
striking to a young audience.</p>
<p>⑦</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>00:26:41,419 to00:26:47,225</li>
</ol>
<p>Anna,what do you know about true love?</p>
<p>More than you.All you know is how to shut people out.(Original
subtitles)</p>
<p>安娜，你懂什么叫做真爱？</p>
<p>比你懂，你总是拒人于千里之外。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Anna,what do you know about true love?</p>
<p>More than you.You are always arrogant and unapproachable to
others.(Back translation)</p>
<p>安娜，你知道什么是真爱吗？</p>
<p>比你懂的多。你只知道怎么拒绝别人。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Anna,what do you know about true love?</p>
<p>More than you know.All you know is how to shut people out.(Back
translation)</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>00:27:19,478 to 00:27:21,255</li>
</ol>
<p>No.Why? Why do you shut me out?! (Original translation)</p>
<p>不！为什么？为什么要拒我于千里之外？（Released translation）</p>
<p>No.Why? Why do you treat so arrogant? (Back translation)</p>
<p>不。为什么？你为什么不理我？（Direct translation）</p>
<p>No.Why? Why do you shut me out? (Back translation)</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>00:27:21,256 to 00:27:23,068</li>
</ol>
<p>Why do you shut the world out?! (Original translation)</p>
<p>为什么你要拒世界于千里之外？（Released translation）</p>
<p>Why do you so arrogant to the whole world? (Back translation)</p>
<p>为什么你谁都不搭理？（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Why do you shut others out? (Back translation)</p>
<p>(Frozen,2013)</p>
<p>Observation： In these three subtitles，the subtitler translated the
phrase “shut somebody out” into “拒于千里之外” on three
occasions.Firstly，“拒于千里之外” is a sentence originally taken from an
ancient idiom story by Mencius.The original meaning of “拒于千里之外” in
the idiom story is to “be arrogant or unapproachable”.Moreover，the
voice of “拒于千里之外” is much stronger than “不搭理”，which expresses
extreme discontent on the part of the receiver.Secondly，in Chinese
young people’s language，because they prefer to speak in an exaggerated
tone，they will prefer to use “拒于千里之外” to express their
unhappiness and dejection in response to other people’s
arrogant，indifferent attitudes.Gradually，this kind of Chinese
traditional expression has become part of young people’s popular
language with some degree of deformation.</p>
<p>⑧</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>00:03:12,777 to 00:03:14,612</li>
</ol>
<p>This could be awesome! (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>这一定会很炫的！（Released translation）</p>
<p>This could be glaring! (Back translation)</p>
<p>这一定是棒极了！（Direct translation）</p>
<p>This could be so cool!(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Rio 2,2014)</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>00:37:26,490 to 00:37:28,170</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m loving San Diego,this place is off to Shizam! (Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>我爱圣地亚哥，这地方实在太炫了。（Released translation）</p>
<p>我爱圣地亚哥，这地方实在太棒了。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>I’m loving San Diego,this place is so cool! (Back translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar 1,2005)</p>
<p>Observation： “炫” is a typical popular language form with the
strategy of localization，which is frequently used in current social
situations，networks and mobile text messages.In most cases，this word
means “awesome，gorgeous or terrific”.The original meaning of this word
in Chinese describes something or someone looking glaring because of
its/his own radiance.</p>
<p>⑨ 00:06:23,342 to 00:06:24,635</p>
<p>FREAKS! (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>怪咖！（Released translation）</p>
<p>怪人！（Direct translation）</p>
<p>FREAKS! (Back translation)</p>
<p>(Rio 2,2014)</p>
<p>Observation： The difference between “怪咖” and “怪人” is that the
former is colloquial language from Taiwan，while the latter is
Mandarin.In current China，given the rapid development of information
technology and a more open policy in tourism，trade and
education，Chinese people on the mainland have increasingly established
ties with people in Taiwan and Hong Kong.With the increasing number of
Taiwanese and Hong Kongese television series，variety shows and films
being broadcast to the mainland，more and more people have become
acquainted with and mastered local expressions from these areas.“咖”
means a kind of people，with the adjective in front of “咖” defining
“the kind of people”.For instance，“怪咖” means a person who is
strange，odd and always presents abnormal behaviours.In another
example，when the adjective is changed to “大” （meaning “big”），and
the word is “大咖”，the meaning will refer to “a famous person or a
person who has notable influence or an important position in a
particular field”.Therefore，this word now becomes a popular expression
in modern Chinese，and with the strategy of localization and transfer is
used in this subtitle translation.</p>
<p>⑩ 00:04:02,860 to 00:04:06,780</p>
<p>You guys.You’ve both made and ruined my day.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>大伙儿，你们今天真是让我欢喜让我忧。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Everybody,you’ve let me up and down today.(Back translation)</p>
<p>你们这伙人。你们让我今天又开心又烦恼。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>You guys.You’ve made me happy and sad today.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar,2012)</p>
<p>Observation： “让我欢喜让我忧” is the name of a famous Chinese pop
song by Zhou Huajian，a well-known Taiwanese singer who was born in Hong
Kong.Although this pop song was released in 1991，it is still
universally popular in today’s China.In KTVs，karaoke venues which are
one of the Chinese people’s preferred entertainment places，this song is
easily in the top 30 of KTV system selections.Therefore，since the
subtitler has artfully used this expression in his subtitling，this
could be an attraction to a Chinese audience.</p>
<p>00:05:05,223 to 00:05: 10,150</p>
<p>FYI,your dog has been leaving little bombs all over my yard.(Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>提醒你一下，你家的狗在我家院子里到处丢炸弹/扔地雷。（Released
translation）</p>
<p>Just remind you,your dog poo poo everywhere in my garden.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>(Despicable Me 1,2010)</p>
<p>Observation： The highlighted pattern is a kind of humorous
expression to express the unpleasant behaviour of the neighbour’s dog in
Gru’s garden （the main character）.In Chinese，it is a popular
expression which uses “炸弹”，“地雷” as a vivid metaphor to describe the
dog’s poo is rebarbative and foul.This is also a veiled expression of
the speaker who shows his unpleasantness regarding this matter.Although
compared with its direct meaning of “poo poo”，“拉屎” only explains the
meaning of the original terms，but cannot deliver the degree of the
unpleasant mood of the speaker.Another intention of the subtitler in
translating this term into the highlighted words is to find common
ground with the daily language most young people use in their real
life.This is a skill aimed at making the audience feel the riotous fun
of the film subtitles.Besides，“拉屎” in Chinese，is not a polite
expression，it should be avoided in everyday social exchanges，and
therefore，the subtitler may have considered its impact in the
translation as well.Generally，although the number of words in
“丢炸弹/扔地雷” is one word more than the direct translation of
“拉屎”，for the above three advantages，the strategies of expansion and
localization in this subtitle are approved.Generally，these typical
examples are the illustration of the collected data regarding the use of
popular expressions in E-C animation film’s subtitle translation.There
were mainly three underlying strategies applied by the subtitlers：
localization，globalization and transfer.By using these strategies，the
popular expressions can make the translated subtitles more effective and
interesting.However，it is a considerable requirement in terms of the
ability of subtitlers； they should have a good knowledge of both source
and target languages and cultures.</p>
