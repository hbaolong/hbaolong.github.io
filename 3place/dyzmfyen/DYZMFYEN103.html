on the Translation of Names in Modern Chinese</h4>
<p>In the last chapter,from the point of view of the comparison between
the lengths of the two languages’ subtitles,I discussed the transfer of
the names of the characters or those of some places and landmarks form
the original subtitles to the translated ones.In this section,from
another perspective — the effectiveness of the translation strategies —
I will take these names to discuss the feasibility of using several
strategies in order to make the translation in this category of words
accepted by modern Chinese language users.Subtitlers sometimes translate
certain original expressions in a direct manner,such as by copying the
original place or character names and placing them into the translated
version directly,so that the translated subtitles in this case are mixed
with Chinese and English: this is an effect that characterizes
globalization.Furthermore,because the names of places or characters
usually have no intrinsic,specific meanings or rarely involve puns,such
translations can be carried out without any substantial loss of
meaning.This kind of linguistic “globalization” is commonly acceptable
to a Chinese target audience.Thus,one social phenomenon in today’s
China,which needs to be introduced here,concerns the current education
level of the Chinese people,which is much higher than that of their
ancestors in the last century.More and more families realize that the
English language,being a very important international language,is often
a vehicle for globalization.Therefore,the learning of English has been
given a key role in the education of China’s younger
generations.Consequently,the original English names for many well-known
places,or common names for people,ought not to be unknown to a typical
modern Chinese audience.Take the following subtitles from Despicable Me
1 as an example:In the 10 examples above,there are different names for
certain characters in the film,as well as famous places and landmarks
from around the world.Simply transferring these names into the
translated subtitles represents a developing tendency in the practice of
film subtitling because of globalization.Given that the main audience
for these films comprises young people,a certain level of knowledge of
other countries can be assumed,such that understanding of these original
names should not be an obstacle in the process of watching and
understanding a film.Even in the worst-case scenario where someone has
no knowledge about English people’s names,wellknown places or
landmarks,understanding the main idea of the film should not be affected
in practice.In Chapter 2 “Literature Review”,I discussed some scholars’
different opinions on the translation of proper nouns.I suggest to keep
the characters’ names of the original text; there will admittedly be an
element of loss for the Chinese audience,as the guttural,somewhat ugly
sound of “Gru” (not a standard name in English) may not be
recognized,and the same applies to the reassuring normality of the name
“Fred” and the slightly sophisticated effect of using the mathematical
term “vector” for a person’s name (the son of the Evil’s bank,his
original name is Victor).That said the pictures in the film can
effectively make up for these limitations.For example,Gru’s strong
accent reflects his non-English name.Therefore,in most cases,the
translation of characters’ names is not necessary unless subtitlers
prefer to explain the original meaning of these names in more detail in
order to help the audience to better understand the personalities of the
name bearers.On these occasions,the readable length and the audience
reception should be the preconditions.</p>
<p>① 00:02:50,500 to 00:02:53,100</p>
<p>Outrage in Egypt tonight as it was discovered</p>
<p>② 00:02:53,150 to 00:02:56,100</p>
<p>That the Great Pyramid of Giza had been stolen.</p>
<p>③ 00:04:47,500 to 00:04:49,000</p>
<p>Morning,Gru!</p>
<p>④ 00:04:52,000 to 00:04:53,000</p>
<p>Hello,Fred.</p>
<p>⑤ 00:09:14,300 to 00:09:20,100</p>
<p>Well,we stole the Times Square Jumbotron!</p>
<p>⑥ 00:09:31,900 to 00:09:35,000</p>
<p>We stole the Statue of Liberty</p>
<p>⑦ 00:09:36,400 to 00:09:39,500</p>
<p>…the small one from Las Vegas.</p>
<p>⑧ 00:09:40,000 to 00:09:43,000</p>
<p>And I won’t even mention the Eiffel Tower!</p>
<p>⑨ 00:15:57,400 to 00:15:59,999</p>
<p>Vector! That’s me.</p>
<p>(Despicable Me 1,2010)</p>
<p>What might be gained from changing these names into Chinese would be
lost through problems of visual and narrative continuity later in the
film，especially if the characters’ original names appear on
screen.However，for places or landmarks，subtitlers would be better
translating them by using standard or accepted Chinese characters，for
example，for “Eiffel Tower”，the standard translation should be
“艾菲尔铁塔”，but not other characters with the same pronunciation in
Chinese，such as “爱飞儿铁塔”.Otherwise，this kind of careless
translation will cause confusion among a typical audience.However，if
the Chinese translation is much longer than the original English
content，something that would take a subtitle beyond its recommended
length，the transcription of original English names into the Chinese
translated subtitle is recommended.In this kind of translation，the
translation strategies of “globalization” and “transcription” should be
used in the context of this target audience.If these two techniques are
applied judiciously to subtitling，taking into account the linguistic
ability of the target audience，they make the translation
communicative，such that the target audience feel that these translated
subtitles are readable and thus easier to understand.If the names of
globally famous landmarks and phenomena are transcribed，the level of
“intercultural communication” that would be achieved will outweigh the
risk of audiences not understanding a subtitle’s content because of the
exoticism of the references.</p>
