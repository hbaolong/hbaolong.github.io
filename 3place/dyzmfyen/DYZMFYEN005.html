<h4 id="motivation-of-the-study">1.1　Motivation of the Study</h4>
<p>With the increasing pace of globalization,both cultural clashes and
cultural integration are inevitable occurrences.Although globalization
can sometimes result in dominant cultures prevailing in regions that are
less influential economically and culturally,more balanced forms of
intercultural communication can facilitate greater mutual comprehension
between nations,fostering tolerance and cooperation.Film products,as a
means of intercultural communication,undoubtedly play a significant role
in helping people from the world’s different regions to understand each
other’s philosophies,traditions and value systems.The visual clarity of
films conveys aspects of a given culture with an immediacy and
accessibility that few other art forms possess.In this exchange
activity,although the role of film subtitlers is extremely important,it
has frequently been undervalued in the process of translating and
distributing films for consumption by audiences abroad.At times,the
preparation of accurate,high-quality subtitles,which convey the essence
of the source culture in a meaningful,evocative way for the target
culture,requires a level of expenditure that film distributors are
unwilling to meet.All too frequently,the reception of a film as a
cultural product in another country is negatively affected by subtitles
who fail in their task concerning intercultural communication.</p>
<p>In 2013,I met with Gottlieb at an international translation studies
conference held in Zhuhai,China.In the course of talking with him about
my study interests in English-Chinese subtitling,I realized that the 10
strategies discussed by Gottlieb,in the context of his own practical
experience,are not always applicable to English-Chinese subtitling
(hereafter,I will use the abbreviation of E-C subtitling in the rest of
the book).Thus,Gottlieb recommended me to build upon the foundations of
his own research and develop more effective strategies in relation to my
study interests,as this would be inevitably helpful to the younger
generation of scholars in developing a broader range of theoretical
frameworks.</p>
<p>The issue of cultural components in film translation is set against
the background of globalization.According to Manning and
Shackford-Bradley (2010),“film can be a vehicle for critiquing and
resisting the master narrative that has controlled discussions of the
economic and cultural changes that define globalization” (p.36).In the
process of globalization,citizens around the world can transcend their
national boundaries and unify under a single “society” that functions
collectively,not only in economic and technological aspects but also in
cultural terms by sharing ways of life,religion and literary works.As a
form of intercultural communication channel,film has the capacity to
highlight various activities,civilizations and living conditions of
human beings around the world.At the highest level of
globalization,films exercise a significant role in the dissemination of
culture.Therefore,when foreign films are imported into China,or when
Chinese films are exported to the rest of the world,ensuring the quality
of AVT work,including subtitles and dubbing,is
critical.Moreover,successfully transferring any cultural phenomenon that
may pervade a whole film is also necessary within AVT.</p>
<p>Cultural elements are increasingly a concern for a growing body of
scholars engaged in subtitling research.For example,at a conference held
at Stirling University,UK,in 2015,Garcia emphasized the importance of
cultural differences in the study of subtitling.Furthermore,at an
international workshop for the training of practical translators,Gavela
gave a lecture on the topic of translation colloquialisms,in which she
explained her case study on the subtitling of animation films by
discussing,in particular,the influence of cultural difference between
English and Spanish upon subtitling.Thanks to the work of these two
Spanish academics,I have acquired knowledge relevant to intercultural
communication in subtitle translation.</p>
<p>Successful intercultural communication has the potential to
accelerate globalization,as well as facilitate a better understanding
between people from different countries and with different national
identities.As such,the challenge for me in researching English to
Chinese AVT,particularly in the area of subtitling,is to help promote
intercultural communication between people from English-speaking
countries and China.Thus,identifying effective ways for improving
subtitle translation quality is inevitable and important.</p>
