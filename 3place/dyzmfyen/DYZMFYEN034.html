<h4 id="polysystem-theory-and-application">3.2　Polysystem Theory and
Application</h4>
<p>I have previously stated that AVT is not only concerned with
effective translation between the source and the target languages.It is
also important to pay significant attention to the myriad layers of
meaning beyond the words.In common with other types of literature-based
product,films and television series can be seen to be a kind of system
within a certain ideology and cultural context.AVT not only involves the
language elements of the target language,but is also affected by the
political,economic,social,and cultural factors of the target country.In
response,Western scholars devised the theoretical framework for the
study of AVT by using Even-Zohar’s polysystem.</p>
<p>The term polysystem was coined by Even-Zohar in a series of papers
written in the 1970s,with their English language versions published
around 1978.(1978a,1978b) “It refers to a group of semiotic systems that
co-exist dynamically within a particular cultural sphere.It is
characterised by continuous changes and internal oppositions,whose main
aim is to occupy the centre position in the system,and it is regulated
by socio-historic norms” (Diaz-Cintas 2004: 22-23).</p>
<p>Karamitroglou (2000) applied Even-Zohar’s theory to his study of
foreign programmes broadcast to a Greek child audience and the ways in
which these programmes were subtitled.He discussed the norms of AVT,such
as the producer (programme distributor,agent,translator,subtitler,and
dubber),the product,the receptor (the potential audience),and the
audio-visual format and so on.According to his research,he was able to
conclude that there were myriad mutually dependent factors that affected
and influenced the translation format of these foreign programmes for
children.These include: the type of programme,the artistic input,the
distinctive features of the source language,scheduling
constraints,marketing strategies,the age of the audience,the audience’s
literacy (reading capability).These elements are the components of a
film polysystem.For subtitlers,all these elements ought to be the
aspects that they have to bear in mind in the process of translating
and,moreover,the most effective translation strategies may achieve
optimal results from the most efficient outputs.</p>
<p>Within this study,I focus on 15 English language animation films that
have been translated into Chinese.On distribution into the Chinese
market,these films achieved the highest box office receipts within their
schedule.All of these animation films possess discernible moral values
within their narratives,lovely and bright colourful images,and
excellence in translated subtitles and dubbing,as well as having
attracted the most significant audience from young people who are
well-educated.Although I intend to develop these observations in the
next section,one can already see that the components of a film
polysystem that broadly applies to all these 15 animations.Therefore,the
current study focuses on potential strategies used by a subtitler to
achieve a better quality of subtitling when they are aware of the inner
logical framework of the film polysystem.</p>
<p>Research has already been published in the context of a related theme
of investigation.In his paper,“In search of a theoretical framework for
the study of audiovisual translation”,Diaz-Cintas pointed out that:</p>
<p>Polysystem is sufficiently flexible to allow us to talk of a film
poly in Spain or in any other country.The film polysystem is made up of
the national products and the translated ones — dubbed or subtitled —
and deals with the relationships that are established among all of
them.This new approach to translation allows for the translated work to
be studied as a product in itself that is integrated in the target
polysystem.(2004: 23)</p>
<p>In Diaz-Cintas’ opinion,the reason why AVT experienced some
deficiencies during the early period of studying the topic was because
most of the study was undertaken from a linguistic perspective,and
therefore scholars neglected or did not pay sufficient attention to
other essential factors,such as social,cultural and industrial
questions.He therefore surmised that applying the polysystem to the
field of AVT should be manifold: “Firstly,it blurs the boundaries
between high and low culture,allowing the reclamation of social
activities that have been traditionally marginalised in the academic
exchange e.g.thrillers or in our case,AVT as opposed to literary or
poetry translation.Secondly,it helps to broaden the research horizon
since it underlines the need to incorporate the translated works in the
study of cinematography of any country” (ibid: 23).</p>
<p>However,Diaz-Cintas also discussed the two main limits of polysystem
in the use of AVT.Firstly,Even-Zohar mentioned the primary position and
secondary position of the elements in polysystem.According to his
division,the ones in the primary position are innovative; the ones in
the secondary position show a more conservative character (1978a:
117-127).Taking the example of his own country,Diaz-Cintas explained
that Even-Zohar’s two conceptions are not always appropriate to the
practical film products market in Spain (2004: 23).</p>
<p>In China,foreign films are not always inventive,while domestic films
show no evidence of a more conservative character.Moreover,Diaz-Cintas
prefers “multimedia”,“audiovisual”,or “screen” translation polysystem
rather than “film polysystem” or “cinematographic polysystem”,because he
tries to encompass all products from the audiovisual world.In this
book,although I only focus on the subtitling of film products,Cintas’
point of view is still relevant.</p>
<p>To sum up,in the study of AVT,polysystem offers a fundamental
framework for the translation of film products beyond the words alone.In
particular,when one regards this theory as a universal theory of
culture,it can instruct the study of cultural awareness in film
subtitling by explaining the economic,social,religious,moral and
political factors of a society.Because film subtitles encompass various
social semiotics,and given that people’s communicative activities are
driven by these semiotics,target audiences are able to understand the
lives and values of people featured in the original film with the aid of
subtitling.</p>
<p>In this research,I regard subtitle translation as a system that is
composed of language features in the E-C translation,the transfer of two
cultures,receptors (literacy levels,daily language preference),the
features of bilingual subtitles (lengths,expressions),and the type of
film.The following diagram shows the connection between each factor and
its counterparts in the present research:</p>
