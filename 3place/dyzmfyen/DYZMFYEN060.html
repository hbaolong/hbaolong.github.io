<h4 id="constructing-a-parallel-corpus">4.2.2　Constructing a Parallel
Corpus</h4>
<p>The corpus requires special apparatus (such as computer
terminals,computer programmes or bespoke software) that need to be
described as a part of the strategy for conducting research (ibid:
82).In this research,I have chosen three software packages to evaluate
these hypotheses: namely,UltraEdit,Microsoft Excel and ParaConc to work
out the specific research results.</p>
<p>Screenshot 1</p>
<p>UltraEdit’s text editing features make editing lists and columns an
intuitive experience,not the exercise in tedium it used to be.With
features like multi-caret editing,column/block editing and
multiselect,it is a simple text editor when I want it to be and a
multi-cursor power editor when you need it to be.Since UltraEdit can
identify all kinds of subtitle files,it is suitable for this
research.The use of this software is simple: when you drag any kind of
the above-mentioned type of subtitle file to the UltraEdit,the bilingual
subtitle pairs appear with automatically labelled serial numbers.Then I
only need simple arithmetic skills to obtain the total number of
subtitle pairs in a film.What is more,when I select and click on a
particular line of subtitle,UltraEdit can tell the numbers of words in
this specific line.Since the first hypothesis in this research is about
the testing of the length difference between the translated subtitles
and their corresponding original subtitles,UltraEdit can help to work
out each line of subtitle first,then put these data into Microsoft
Excel,such that the result of length difference can be calculated by a
manual set-up format such as “A-B=X”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,Microsoft Excel is arguably the most suitable tool for
collating statistics amongst commonly used computer software.In order to
assemble all the language data from the selected 15 films,Excel will
naturally be the appropriate option for this activity.Moreover,its
feature of “properties” helped me tailor Excel to meet her own specific
requirements in the collation of statistics.For example,in order to
calculate the length difference between the original English text and
the subtitles translated into Chinese,I am able to create “remark I”
with the name of “the length difference” in one additional column and
use the preset formula as “sub (A,B)” (sub is one of the preset
functions in Excel) to get the desired result.A more detailed
description of the use of Excel in the collection of data in the corpus
of this study is given in the following section of this
chapter.Inevitably,since the research is concerned with E-C
subtitling,the main limitations and appropriate translation strategies
consequently become the key investigating objectives.According to the
classification of the main types of corpora in translation studies,a
parallel corpus that compares the original text with the translated
subtitles is the most suitable.Therefore,Microsoft Excel and UltraEdit
can help me to test the first hypothesis about the length difference as
well as being a preparation to the next step of testing the second and
third hypotheses about the use of culturally loaded expressions in
Chinese translated subtitles.</p>
<p>Lastly,the software of ParaConc is “a bilingual or multilingual
concordancer that can be used in contrastive analyses,language
learning,and translation studies/training” (http://www.paraconc.com/).In
this research,I plan to test the frequency of the use of traditional
expressions as well as the frequency of the use of popular expressions
in the E-C animation films’ subtitle translation.The results of these
frequencies can help me to identify my second and third hypotheses
concerning whether the use of these two types of expressions can make
the translated subtitles of English animation films more attractive
among Chinese audiences and among young people in particular.</p>
<p>After identifying the most suitable software to build up the specific
corpus for this research,the detailed application procedures are as
follows:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Chosen Linguistic Data</li>
</ol>
<p>The chosen texts constitute the first element in a corpus.In this
study,15 English language texts and their corresponding Chinese language
subtitles are brought together in a parallel corpus as the linguistic
data.These data are classified respectively in terms of the types of
traditional expressions and popular expressions.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Collecting Data</li>
</ol>
<p>Before establishing the corpus,with the recommendation by Huang,I had
the chance to talk with two scholars,Liang and Xu,during a summer course
I attended in 2014.These two scholars are wellknown professionals in the
field of corpus study in China.</p>
<p>In the course of the conversation about how to construct a suitable
corpus for this specific study,they offered a great deal of useful
advice that enabled the researcher to build up her corpus in a
purposeful and focused way.The main elements of this advice were as
follows: firstly,they encouraged the researcher to seek practical input
from the Shanghai Translated Film Studio,the official company for
translating exported films in China; secondly,they recommended naming
this specific corpus as a “self-built parallel corpus for a special
purpose”,in view of the usage and scale of the corpus; thirdly,in the
next phase of the research work,they encouraged the researcher to
continue inputting more data into the corpus in order to obtain more
effective and objective data results; lastly,they recommended
transforming the data results into value measurements with a practical
application to help real-world subtitlers produce subtitles of a more
effective and reliable quality.</p>
<p>Given that the research objective is animation film subtitles,most of
the raw linguistic data are spoken language rather than written
language.Therefore,the source of these raw language materials is the
films’ dialogues.Yang and Tang (2014: 174) advised to download all the
relevant materials from the Sheshou website.This website is free of
charge and offers bilingual subtitles (English and Chinese) of almost
all the animated films released in China in the last 15 years or
so.Therefore,the first raw materials for this research were the
downloaded text-based film dialogues.When I inputted the names of the
films on the website,specifying “E-C bilingual subtitles” as the key
search request,she obtained two main subtitle categories from this
website.One category was originally in PDF or CAJ format,while the other
was in SSA or SRT format.In the search of the 15 selected film
subtitles,most of them are in SRT format; I needed to transfer this
format into plain text versions.Then,the previously introduced UltraEdit
helps to open each type of the mentioned format of subtitle documents as
the following example shows:</p>
<p>Screenshot 2</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>Aligning the Bilingual Subtitles</li>
</ol>
<p>The alignment of dual languages in a corpus is useful to researchers
as an efficient means of collecting data.This technology helps
researchers align bilingual materials with the same meaning in the
source and translated texts with its algorithm.The units of alignment
are varied: namely,passage alignment,sentence alignment,phrase
alignment,word alignment and even character alignment.The smaller the
unit is,the most linguistic the information it offers.However,in this
research project,because I want to verify my study hypotheses about the
impact of cultural elements in subtitling,I have chosen to undertake
sentence aligning.Sentence aligning can help me to observe the length
difference between the source subtitle and the target subtitle.As the
above UltraEdit sample shows,after the aligning of each pair of
subtitles in the unit of sentence is accomplished,the use of Microsoft
Excel can help to fulfil the further calculation.Moreover,the aligning
in the sentence unit can also help me to test the frequency of the use
of two kinds of culturally loaded expressions in my second and third
hypotheses; therefore,the use of UltraEdit in this research is an
appropriate choice.Besides,as a way of preparation and backup,I can also
keep the raw materials in the form of “time code + original English
original subtitle + Chinese translated subtitle” in 15 UltraEdit files
as well.The advantages of taking this preparatory step are as follows:
the time code helped the researcher to self-evaluate after finishing the
task; I could check any pair or pairs of bilingual subtitles in terms of
their synchronism,which means that only the frames match the
subtitles,resulting in the audience being able to see the synchronism of
pictures and dialogues.Then,putting the translated subtitles and the
source subtitles into two lines,as well as locating them in the form of
“text-align left”,helped the researcher to see the length difference
between each pair immediately.The edition of Microsoft Excel in the
corpus involves 15 files,each of which contains one particular set of
film subtitles.The other edition of the Word document in the corpus also
involves 15 files,as well as backup files separately containing the 15
selected film subtitles.</p>
<p>The following examples show a sample is kept in three kinds of
software: the UltraEditor,Excel and Notepad:</p>
<p>Screenshot 3</p>
<p>Screenshot 4</p>
<p>Screenshot 5</p>
<p>Take the third pair of subtitles as an example.The time code shows
that the dialogue started at the first minute and 31 seconds of the
film,with the first subtitle lasting about two seconds,while there are
seven words in the original subtitle and three characters in the
translated subtitle.In a visual sense,because the structure of Chinese
characters is relatively compact and independent,the length difference
between the bilingual subtitles is not very obvious.But because the
different word formations,Chinese characters look more complex than
English characters; therefore,I estimate the reading time of Chinese
subtitles should be longer than that of English ones.</p>
<p>As the description above explains,the software of UltraEdit and
Microsoft Excel can help me realize my testing of the first
hypothesis,that is,the length comparison between each pair of Chinese
translated subtitles and its corresponding English original text.Then,in
order to test and calculate the frequency of two typical expressions in
Chinese translated subtitles,that is,traditional expression and popular
expression,another two hypotheses need to be tested,which concern
whether these two types of expressions are effective in making the
translated subtitles more attractive and interesting to audiences,and to
identify the strategies used behind these expressions.In the
process,another software package “paraconc”,is available to assist me in
obtaining results about the “frequency” of each type of expression in
the collected data.As the following example shows,I put the label “TE”
(traditional expression) and “PE” (popular expression) at the end of
each translated subtitle which is relevant to traditional expression
or/and popular expression,then put the whole text of one film’s data
into paraconc; the subtitles which are labelled will be shown in serial
numbers.</p>
