<h4 id="early-period-of-studies">2.4.1　Early Period of Studies</h4>
<p>Western scholars began studying film translation in the late 1950s
and into the early 1960s from the perspective of translation
studies.“Tradition et cinema”,the first academic article on this
topic,was published in 1956 in the periodical Le Linguiste/De
Taalkundige.This was followed in 1960 with the publication of an article
entitled “Cinéma et traduction” in a special edition of Babel,a
well-known academic journal dedicated to translation studies.These
papers were generally considered as Western scholars’ first attempt at
opening up a new concept in the field of translation studies,namely,AVT
studies.</p>
<p>In 1974,the first article that particularly focused on subtitling was
written by Dollerup and published in Babel.Entitled “On subtitles in
television programs”,this article analysed and defined the error types
the translators did and that arise in the course of subtitle translation
of TV programmes from English into Danish: 1) mishearing;2) misread or
overlooked a word or part of a message; 3) dyslexic reading error;
4)construed the meaning of an English word from the translator’s
knowledge of other English words; 5) the meaning from the
extralinguistic context; 6) failure to identify and understand
neologisms,idiosyncrasies and,possibly,ad hoc formations;7)
mistranslating the idioms; 8) failure to get the gist of the meaning
revealed in translations; 9) did not use common sense to translate the
original text; 10) a few words and terms were “translated” into
nonexistent Danish ones; 11) the failure to choose the correct
equivalent when one word in the source language covers (or splits up
into) two or more in the target language (1974: 200-202).Although these
mistakes talked up by Dollerup occur in the context of English-Danish
translation,they can be found in E-C translation as
well.Moreover,Dollerup was not only the first person who particularly
discussed the above research issue,but was also the first to establish
the importance of subtitling in the context of foreign language learning
and teaching.Film subtitles as a means of foreign language pedagogy have
attracted the interest of scholars such as Danan (1991),Gottlieb (1992)
and Xiao (2010; 2012).All of them have discussed effective ways of using
AVT products in classroom teaching and learning.Studying from the
perspective of foreign language pedagogy,however,is still in its infancy
within film translation study; as such,more systematic and specific
research is needed.In 1976,Fodor published his book,Film Dubbing:
Phonetic,Semiotic,Esthetic and Psychological Aspects.In it,Fodor
discussed the idea of “synchronization” in voice,characterization and
performance in the process of film translation,suggesting that this
technique might help the translated film appear more natural and result
in higher audience satisfaction.He also argued that it was impossible to
make film translation perfect in every aspect given variable factors
such as how body language changes with different cultural
backgrounds,customs and languages,etc.(1976: 82) Furthermore,Fodor
explained the different meanings behind certain kinds of body language
in various cultures and discussed the variety of visual effects that
were produced by different angles in film shooting.Although Fodor’s
approach focused on dubbing rather than subtitling in film
translation,his contribution is still worthy of consideration in the
study of film subtitle translation,because subtitling also relates to
the abovementioned factors and elements in its nature.Overall,Fodor was
the first to study film dubbing translation from diversified
perspectives such as psychology,linguistics,semiology and aesthetics.His
allround study offered a foundation to the subsequent construction of
film translation theories in the West.The research points discussed by
Fodor prompt me to consider subtitle translation as a multicomponent
task,which involves the receptor’s language preference,effective
strategies and intercultural factors.These elements may determine
whether the translation is linguistically correct and culturally
acceptable.</p>
<p>In his (1982) article,“Les sous-titres…un mal necessaire”,Marleau
largely discussed the techniques of subtitle type-setting as well as
analysing the issues in film subtitle translation from its
technological,linguistic,psychological and artistic angles.He stated
that the problems relate to composition,as well as being the first to
draw attention to the economic factors in film subtitle
translation,along with emphasizing the importance of teamwork when
producing highquality translated films.In his study,the mechanical
limits,economic factor and social value are all components that the
translator should be aware of in the process of subtitling.Like Fodor,he
noticed the subtitle translation is not isolated or simplistic in
nature; it should involve the concerns of subtitle drafting
skills,linguistic knowledge,the receptor’s language preference and the
ability to accept the source culture,as well as the recognition of
social surroundings and knowledge of performing arts.Since it is
imperative that all the necessary techniques are used and knowledge
applied,Marleau suggested that translating a film needs a group of
people to work together.In my opinion,the subtitle translator should
have a certain level of skill and knowledge in order produce readable
translated subtitles,which can meet the basic mechanical requirement
(for example,to decide the number of lines in each frame or; to make the
effective length of translated subtitles),as well as the overarching
requirement of translation (for example,to make the translated subtitles
correct in terms of language and acceptable in terms of culture).In
turn,the translator should pass his draft work to other teamworkers to
modify the composition of translated subtitles,align the subtitles with
the corresponding frames,or setting or embellishing the frames.</p>
<p>In the same year,Titford,in his book Subtitling: Constrained
Translation,introduced his celebrated idea of “constrained translation”
by considering film as a means of constrained media.For him,subtitling
was “constrained” because it needs to meet the requirement of
“synchronization” with dubbing and moving pictures.Subsequent to
Titford’s theory,scholars such as Asensio,Kelly and Gallardo located the
concept of “constrained translation” within their later practice of film
subtitle translation.As a researcher of subtitling,I agree with
Titford’s consideration,because subtitling unavoidably encounters
limitations along the lines of the aforementioned unique character of
audiovisual materials.In this research,the limits of the mechanical arts
in translating Chinese subtitles and original English subtitles are also
mentioned.Considerations of the proper length of translated Chinese
subtitles and original subtitles are reflected in the first
hypothesis.Before starting to compare the length difference between each
pair of translated subtitles and its corresponding original text,I
conducted two interviews and read relative literature to identify the
acceptable numbers of words in each line of a subtitle in both Chinese
and English.</p>
