<h4 id="period-in-which-avt-study-flourished">2.4.2　Period in which AVT
Study Flourished</h4>
<p>The year 1987 can be regarded as the start of a flourishing period
for AVT Study in the West.The symbolic event was a conference held by
the European Broadcasting Union on the subject of dubbing and subtitling
which took place in Stockholm.After this conference,a number of other
conferences as well as publications on film translation were
organized.</p>
<p>In an article for Babel entitled “Translation and mass communication:
film and TV translation as evidence of cultural dynamics”,Delabastita
(1989) focused on cultural elements within AVT.Based on his early study
of descriptive translation studies (DTS) and pun translation,his
emphasis on “the norms that underlie translation behaviour” motivated
other scholars in this area.I agree with the importance of cultural
components in AVT.In the translated films,the transfer between two
cultures is inevitable in the process of subtitle translation,since
“language reflects and affects culture; they are human inventions.They
are two dimensions of each other,interrelated and inseparable” (Fantini
ed.1997: 4).In this study,two types of culturally loaded expressions
(introduced in the abstract as traditional expressions and popular
expressions) in the translated Chinese subtitles in the given data
highlight the relationship between language and culture.In turn,the
standards for ensuring the quality of subtitling should be
linguistically correct and culturally accepted.</p>
<p>Since 1990,more and more scholars have contributed their talents and
efforts to the study of film translation,typified by Luyken’s
collaboration with other scholars in the publication of the
book,Overcoming Language Barriers in TV: Dubbing and Subtitling for the
European Audience.(1993) This book offered a great deal to the study of
AVT at the time of publication.In it,Luyken stated that it was necessary
to undertake classified study on various translation modes.He also
analysed different translation methods that can be applied in various
kinds of language transfer in films.Using a large amount of data that
was collected from translated European films,costs and audience
preferences helped this book become influential in its field.Luyken
pointed out that,unlike literary translation,subtitle translation is
restricted by time and space.As such,subtitlers should consider the
readable length of translated subtitles first.An awareness of cultural
elements is also important in the process of translation because
cultural ignorance may result in undertranslation.In this research,I
will take the consideration of the readable length as my first
hypothesis.Besides referencing the standard length of Chinese subtitles
and that of English subtitles,I also consider the regularity of E-C
subtitling in the selected animation films.Cultural elements are also
reflected in my second and third hypotheses.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards,in 1992,Ivarsson published his book,Subtitling for
the Media: A Handbook of an Art.This book was regarded as the first
authoritative work on the study of subtitle translation.In the
book,Ivarsson explicitly introduced the developing history of subtitle
translation and,informed by his rich practical experience as a subtitle
translator,he recorded his own understanding of subtitle translation
techniques and strategies.In 1998,Ivarsson published the second edition
of this book with the help of Carroll,simply renaming the book
Subtitling,and addressing more topical subtitle translation strategies
that were being used in new media technologies such as digital
technology.In so doing,Carroll and Ivarsson established “Practice
Guidelines for Successful Subtitle Translation”.However,as these
guidelines were limited by the scope of the study area,culture and
language,they were too general in terms of offering suggestions and
solutions to possible problems that the translator might meet in his or
her practical work.Nonetheless,in terms of the development of AVT study
in the West,Ivarsson’s two books are still considered as the foundation
for the development of Europebased AVT study.</p>
<p>After 1995,AVT study in the West developed at a much faster rate with
scholars carrying out more research on this subject,especially European
scholars.The most influential amongst them are
Gambier,Gottlieb,Karamitroglou,Ivarsson,Chaume and Diaz-Cintas.In the
next section,their studies’ value and limits are reviewed.</p>
<p>One of the leading figures in the study field of AVT,Gambier has
attended and presided over almost all conferences on the subject of AVT
studies as well as having written books and edited a great number of
academic journals.In his written work,he has classified the types of
subtitle translation modes,discussed feasible translation strategies and
approached the acceptance of subtitle translation.In 2001,Gambier and
Gottlieb published a collection of symposium papers under the
title,(Multi) Media Translation: Concepts,Practices and Research.This
collection brought together 26 articles on various topics relating to
multimedia translation from two famous conferences.Most of these
articles discuss subtitling.The article authors provided different
research perspectives on the strategies of subtitling,including James’
emphasis on quality control in subtitling,Diaz -Cintas’ discussion on
certain factors in the quality of subtitling,and Ceron’s focus on
punctuation in subtitling.In 2003,in his book,Screen Transadaptation:
Perception and Reception,Gambier discussed the political impact on
languages used in film translation.</p>
<p>Gottlieb can be said to be one of the pioneers in translation studies
who are concerned with subtitling.He has studied subtitle translation
from a linguistic perspective.His main contribution to this field of
study can be summarized as subtitle translation strategies:
“expansion,paraphrase,transfer,imitation,transcription,dislocation,condensation,decimation,deletion
and resignation” (1992: 166) (Typology will be explained in details in
the next chapter) as well as subtitle translation as a means of foreign
language pedagogy.In 1992,he published an article entitled “Subtitling:
a new university discipline” (Dollerup 1992).He defined the term
“subtitle” in five respects: 1) written,2) additive (e.g.,new verbal
material is added in the form of subtitles),3) immediate,4)
synchronous,and 5) polymedial (e.g.,at least two channels are employed)
forms of translation.(ibid: 162) A subtitle,according to
Gottlieb,functions as a special translation form in writing that needs
to include additional information for enhanced understanding by the
target audience.It appears in the lower part of the screen
immediately,and should be synchronous with audiovisual pictures and the
characters’ performance (1992: 161).For Gottlieb,subtitle translation
differs from other kinds of translation because it is limited by
technical factors and situational contexts.Gottlieb classified the
constraints of subtitle translation into two categories:
formal/quantitative and textual/qualitative (ibid: 164).The former
category deals with the physical limitations of subtitle translation;
the latter,however,places an emphasis upon synchronism between
characters’ dialogue and the moving image when subtitling.</p>
<p>According to Gottlieb,the acceptable time period for a subtitle to
remain on screen is about two to three seconds,as it gives the audience
enough time to read the subtitle.In the case of the English language,the
recommended length for a subtitle is no more than 35 letters; for
Chinese,however,the maximum is estimated at less than 15 characters
(Wang 2014:306) or the ideal length of a Chinese subtitle is 11-15
characters (Li and Bo 2005: 46).The words in subtitles have the feature
of instantaneity: they are unlike words in books and,as such,the
audience may not get a chance to reread them.So,the expectations for
subtitling are much greater than for other types of translation.</p>
<p>Over the past decade,AVT study has developed rapidly in European
countries,while more and more international academic conferences and
organizations are emerging related to this subject.Most scholars emanate
from northern European countries where the leading topic is subtitle
translation rather than dubbing translation.In turn,the main themes of
the aforementioned conferences are always concerned with the study of
subtitle translation.For instance,in February 2004,an international
conference was held in London entitled “Language Transfer on
Screen”.Over 100 scholars submitted and discussed their articles at this
conference.Meanwhile,in October 2005,another international conference
took place at the University of Bologna,Italy,on the topic of “Between
text and images: the latest film translation study”.Moreover,the
international “Languages and Media” conference,which is held every two
years in Berlin,regularly brings together a great number of AVT
researchers and scholars for the purpose of exchanging information
with,and learning from,each other.</p>
<p>The International Federation of Translators (officially known as
Fédération Internationale des Traducteurs,or FIT) was the first academic
organization to understand the importance of AVT study.In 1987,they
established a committee called “Media Translators and Interpreters” at
the FIT World Congress,particularly to explore developing issues in
Media Translation.Meanwhile,in 1995,the European Association for Studies
in Screen Translations (ESIST) was set up and soon became the most
influential academic organization for AVT studies in Europe.Prompted by
the observation that AVT was not receiving enough attention from
existing scholars,ESIST was established by 16 university teachers,drawn
from 10 different European countries,all of whom were interested in the
study of AVT.Since its establishment the association has sought to
emphasize and improve the development of study in this area,with the
purpose of offering an opportunity to scholars,teachers,students,and
audiovisual translators to communicate with each other,and discuss the
pedagogies and practicalities of AVT.</p>
<p>In recent years,publishers such as St.Jerome and John Benjamins have
printed a number of Diaz-Cintas’ works as well as collaborations with
other scholars These publications include Media for All: Subtitling for
the Deaf,Audio Description,and Sign Language (2007),The Didactics of
Audiovisual Translation (2008),Audiovisual Translation; Language
Transfer on Screen (2009),New Trends in Audiovisual Translation
(2009),and Insights into Audiovisual Translation and Media Accessibility
(2010).In addition,in 2007,Diaz-Cintas collaborated on the
textbook,Audiovisual Translation: Subtitling (Translation Practices
Explained),with Remael.This book has since been widely recognized in a
number of European countries as the first textbook of Subtitle
Translation and includes assorted DVD materials as well.In his
works,Cintas emphasized the importance of cultural elements when
translating films and creating other types of AV products.</p>
<p>In New Trends in Audiovisual Translation (2009),Cintas and other
leading experts in the field of AVT discussed innovative and
interdisciplinary topics that offered new insights into the study of
AVT.In a highly convincing way,it discussed some of the main linguistic
and cultural challenges that translators encounter when translating
films and other audiovisual productions.In the first part of this
work,he collated papers that shared the common thread of looking at AVT
from the perspective of cultural awareness.Experts from different
countries discussed their own specific studies from the viewpoint of
cultural differences.For instance,in his article “Subtitling against the
current: Danish concepts,English minds”,Gottlieb discussed the
strategies used in the subtitling of extralinguistic,culturally specific
references and discovered that the genre of film plays a part in some
cases of subtitle translation.Within subtitle translation between
Chinese and English,the current researcher found that the genre of film
plays an important role to a certain extent.For example,when subtitling
a documentary film about the life of ethnically diverse people in
Southwest China,the subtitler may mainly use the strategies of
cross-cultural awareness in their translation process.Meanwhile,when
translating an English comedy film into Chinese,the subtitler may employ
vernacular expressions in Chinese found on the internet in order to
attract more audience.Pettit,in her article “Connecting cultures:
Cultural transfer in subtitling and dubbing”,investigated the specific
problems that relate to cultural features embedded within audiovisual
products.From within her particular study area,she examined how cultural
transfer is carried out between English and French in two AVT modes from
the perspective of pragmatics and semiotics.Pettit’s view of “cultural
transfer” in AVT subtitling is consistent with former scholars who
consider that “language is a part of culture” and emphasized the
importance of culturally loaded words in subtitling.</p>
<p>When considering E-C subtitle translation,I will also emphasize the
importance of “cultural awareness” in the process of translation,because
film products,as a form of cultural product,will inevitably be involved
in cultural discourse.</p>
<p>In 2009,Cintas also edited a collection of symposium papers entitled
Audiovisual Translation: Language Transfer on Screen,with
Anderman.Included in this collection of papers were two on the topic of
subtitling.These contributions offered a detailed view of translation
modes used in audiovisual media.In “Subtitling for the DVD
Industry”,Georgakopoulou discussed the rapid development of the DVD
market and the rise in subtitling within the international market.She
explained several constraints that are generally inherent in subtitling
along with discussing subtitling from English into other languages in
particular.She analysed data from the European Captioning Institute
(ECI),a UK-based subtitling company and one of the global leaders in
multilingual DVD subtitling.Georgakopoulou’s main contribution was to
point out the potential of subtitling offered by the “template”,a file
containing the master (sub) titles in English that is subsequently the
foundation for translation into all languages in a given
project.However,the understanding of “centralization” in this article
only reflected the viewpoint of a company manager,not that of AVT
professionals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,in “Subtitling Norms in Greece and Spain”,Sokoli focused on
norms in the choices made by subtitlers,as manifested in the translated
films themselves.In response,she proposed bringing in an evaluative
element as her contribution to the evolution of DTS.The following table
shows the summary of her found norms (p.202):</p>
<p>Her findings from the corpus offer a useful document in her discussed
languages.Meanwhile,regarding E-C subtitle translations,her concern for
technique constraints,the expectancy norms of clarity and
understanding,the professional norm of preference for simple words and
uncomplicated structures are worth referencing and studying.In the
second hypothesis of this research,the use of traditional expressions
(e.g.,Chinese idioms,archaisms) in E-C subtitle translation is accepted
as an effective way for shortening the length of a translated
subtitle,and for it to be displayed in a simple structure.The expected
third hypothesis will explore the use of popular expressions
(e.g.,popular language in social networks,neologisms) in making the
translated subtitle understandable and meeting the language preference
of young people (the main audience for translated animation films in
China).</p>
<p>However,the link between globalization and subtitling is her
weakness.Furthermore,in “Amateur Subtitling on the Internet”,Bogucki
assessed the available criteria (e.g.,there should be no more than two
lines in subtitles) for quality assessment and their application to AVT
by taking a film as a study sample.As for E-C subtitle translation,the
readable number of lines is also considered to be “no more than two
lines on one frame” (Yang 2012 cited in Yang 2014:174).Therefore,in this
research,the readable length (the ideal numbers of words or characters)
for a translated subtitle will be discussed in relation to single-line
subtitles.</p>
<p>In summary,as a leading figure amongst current experts in
AVT,Diaz-Cintas has made a considerable contribution to the discussion
of translation strategies and modes from diversified and
multidisciplinary perspectives such as linguistics,pragmatics,semiotics
and cultural studies.Although his research has subsequently inspired
other scholars,none of them are native Chinese speakers,and therefore
his achievements have limitations for Chinese scholars.In recent
years,more and more scholars have taken up the study of AVT,while young
academics have conducted doctoral research into AVT and Subtitling.In
2013,Altahri investigated the problems and strategies involved in Arabic
subtitling of the cultural references in the Harry Potter film series.He
specifically analysed different types of cultural factor,such as names
of people,mythological creatures,magical objects,place names,foods,and
neologisms,which are considered to be the basic elements in a film.His
conclusion was that there was a complexity of cultural,ideological and
technical aspects,all of which has had a significant impact on
subtitlers,and that the concern of cultural factors in AVT is
necessary,especially when translating from English to Arabic given that
the cultural backgrounds in these two languages are very different.His
analysis shows that the Arabic subtitlers tend to use more strategies as
intercultural communication,globalization,and localization in dealing
with cultural references.Although his research focused on the
transference of English into Arabic at the levels of language and
culture,it still has relevance to this current study because of its
focus on subtitling from the perspective of cultural awareness.His
discussion of names of characters and places,proper nouns and
translation strategies from the perspective of cultural awareness,such
as globalization and localization,are new insights that are relevant to
the current study.Besides making selections from Gottlieb’s typology,the
consideration of globalization and localization forms part of my
discussion about effective strategies in E-C subtitle translation.</p>
<p>It is clear that the work undertaken by scholars in Western countries
that the study of AVT in the West has developed in a diversified and
interdisciplinary way.Over 50 years ago,scholars began to carry out
research on the topic of AVT in response to the invention of TV and
films.In order to broaden the overseas market and attract more
audiences,subtitle translation emerged as a new discipline in the film
producing sector.Therefore,scholars and practitioners began to identify
effective strategies in producing better quality translated products.In
the past 20 years,experts in different European countries have carried
out their own research in AVT from more varied perspectives.Some of them
have investigated the strategies and typologies of translation modes
from the viewpoint of linguistics; some of them have carried out their
study from the perspective of cultural studies; and some have preferred
to undertake research by considering the up-to-date forms of media,such
as mobile and digital video.Moreover,study in this area has entered a
boom period due to an increasing number of AVT academic committees being
established,international conferences,and academic journals.</p>
<p>There are more and more scholars,practitioners,practical subtitle
translators,university teachers and postgraduate students interested in
this subject.Their research and achievements have offered other
countries like China,which are in the early stages of studying
AVT,innumerable invaluable ideas and information.The following section
provides an historical overview of the development of AVT in
China,followed by a detailed comparison and,finally,suggestions for
promoting the study of AVT in China.</p>
