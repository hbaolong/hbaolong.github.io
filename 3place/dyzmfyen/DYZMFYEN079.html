<h4 id="data-analysis">5.3.1　Data Analysis</h4>
<p>The 15 pairs of bilingual subtitles in this film are composed of the
first part of the questionnaire; see Part I below:</p>
<p>Result of Part I</p>
<p>Related to the first hypothesis,the above content can be plain data
as well.From the numbers of words labelled in each pair,it is obvious
that all of the 15 Chinese translated subtitles are greater in length
than the corresponding English text.Within these 15 pairs of subtitles,I
found that two pairs of released Chinese translated subtitles can be
improved and become shorter than the current given ones.The following
discussion on each of these pairs of subtitles illustrates a better way
of translating these subtitles.</p>
<p>For the first pair:</p>
<p>Outrage in Egypt tonight as it was discovered that the Great Pyramid
of Giza had been stolen.(17 words) (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>今晚埃及爆出特大新闻——吉萨金字塔被人偷了。（19 characters）（Released
translation）</p>
<p>(Back translation: Tonight,Egypt announced huge news — someone has
stolen the Great Pyramid of Giza.)</p>
<p>Observations： Option C gives respondents a chance to recommend their
own translation.One respondent gave his translation thus：
“吉萨金字塔发现被盗！愤怒席卷埃及！（更符合新闻语言）（It was found that
the Great Pyramid of Giza was stolen！ Outrage all over the
Egypt！）（More like news language）”.As the respondent，himself
labelled his translation as being more akin to news
language，therefore，this translation accords with the background of
this subtitle： this subtitle appears on the screen when it was
reporting the news.I agree this translation is better than the released
one because the respondent separated the original subtitle into two
short sentences，using the passive voice and an exclamation mark in the
first sentence in order to imitate a journalist’s voice and tone for
emphasizing the news as being appalling to the whole country.The
translation of the second short sentence was also finished with an
exclamation mark in order to strengthen the emphasis.The use of media
phrasing makes the translation brief and even shorter than the released
one.Therefore，the translation from this respondent is innovative on
account of its use of incisive media phrasing.</p>
<p>For the other subtitle in Question 7,the original text has 10
words,while the corresponding original text has 13 words.Although,in
line with the previous review about the ideal length of a single-line
subtitle,10 original words and 13 translated words are ideal,I still
think there is a better way to translate this subtitle,which not only
makes the translated subtitle shorter than the current length but also
makes the language more appropriate.</p>
<p>They’re saying he makes all other villains look lame.(10 words)
(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>他们都说跟他相比，其他坏蛋都算是太菜了。（22 characters）（Released
translation）</p>
<p>(Back translation: They all said,compared with him,other badass are
rookies.)</p>
<p>Observations： There are three expansions and one popular expression
in the given translated subtitle.The word “都” is an emphasis in order
to show the speaker’s “admiration” to “him”，that is，Vector，the main
protagonist of the film.The background information is that Vector has
stolen a pyramid，which shocked the whole world，with people regarding
him as the number one thief in the world，while other criminals are much
more inferior to him.Then the subtitler translated the following
sentence pattern separately by using a comma to divide the subtitle into
two parts： the first pattern “跟他相比” （compared with him） and the
second pattern “其他坏蛋”in the translation； the purpose here in
separating these two patterns was to complete the expression in
Chinese.However，I also considered “他让其他所有坏蛋都显得很菜” （he
makes all other villains look lame）.This translation has nine
characters，which is shorter than the given one and can be considered as
a more applicable translation.Therefore，the given translation with
expansion is not necessary in this case.</p>
<p>In the second part of the questionnaire，there are five multiple
choice questions.The second question asks about the length of translated
subtitles： “Do you think the length of Chinese translated subtitles is
readable？” A high number of respondents，90 out of 97 （93%），agreed
that the length of the official subtitling was readable，5% agreed
partly and only 2% of respondents said they could not read the
subtitling in time.This was a significant result because the majority of
students showed their capacity to read the Chinese subtitles at an
adequate speed，assisted by their aural comprehension skills in
English.For some reason，a minority of students said that they sometimes
felt it was difficult to follow the subtitling，with 2% of the others
feeling that it was hard to keep up in time.The reasons may vary： some
students’ listening skills in English may not be developed enough to
follow the soundtrack in the film’s original language，others’ reading
speed may not be fast enough，and some of them may simply be unable to
keep up with the subtitling because of poor eyesight.However，this
result generally reflects the practical English level of this group of
respondents.According to the requirement to the graduates in English
majors in university level of education background，Chinese Education
Bureau requests their English vocabulary to be more than 8，000 words
[《英语专业四、八级词汇表》Vocabulary of Test for English Majors （TEM）
Band 4 and Band 8] and their reading speed to be more than 120 words per
minute （Ye Changqing 2016： 36）.As each frame in a film averagely
takes 2-3 seconds，the average reading speed of English original
subtitles of these respondents is theoretically 4-6 words，and as the
data of Despicable Me 1 shows，its average length of English original
subtitles is 7.13 words，I think the result of this question is
reasonable.Moreover，in the selected 15 films，Madagascar 1 has the
greatest length in English original subtitles as 7.63 words； I consider
that the majority of respondents and the similar level of other Chinese
audiences may be able to get adequate information not only the Chinese
translated subtitles but also the English original subtitles among the
selected films.In other words，their comprehension of the selected films
will be generally successful.</p>
<p>The main finding of this section is that people from a young age
group generally find that the current lengths of subtitles in Chinese
are appropriate and readable in the timeframe allowed.The inference from
the 7% (5% +2%) who have difficulty in following the subtitles in
Chinese is that subtitling companies should continue to ensure that
subtitles are concise and do not extend them beyond their current
standard lengths.</p>
<p>Then Part 3 of the questionnaire is an open-ended question: “In your
opinion,what have been the main problems and weaknesses that have
emerged in the subtitles of recently released animation films?” I
collated and categorized the main elements or the keywords from the 97
participants’ responses,as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Table 4</p>
<p>In order to see each proportion of the six influencing factors,I
generated the above form to a bar chart in Excel:</p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<p>As the above charts show,six main elements or keywords were found in
the 97 correctly completed questionnaires.These were: cultural barriers;
the speed of the original subtitles — fast; the different ways of
thinking in English and Chinese; proper nouns; translation quality;
and,the story of the film.Amongst these elements,different ways of
thinking in English and Chinese is also a kind of cultural
barriers.“Proper nouns” and “the story of the film” also require the
audience to possess a certain level of cultural knowledge.Therefore,we
can see that 46% of respondents directly reported that the main problem
in the current crop of animation films concerns cultural barriers.To
eliminate this kind of obstacle,the subtitlers need to add extra
information or explanations to help the audience.However,in
practice,with the limited time that a viewer has for reading film
subtitles,subtitles that are overlong will not be readable.In the
earlier evaluation of the lengths of two versions of subtitles and the
length difference between the two tested languages in this current
research,the researcher recommends that the number of characters within
a Chinese translated subtitle should be within 23 characters,and that
the average value of difference between the two language subtitles
should be around 2.33.Indeed,64% of the 97 respondents specifically felt
that the problem is about different ways of thinking in English and
Chinese.As the largest one of the six factors that were cited by the
respondents,it means this factor is the main factor to consider during
the process of subtitling.From the perspective of translation
studies,the most effective and best quality translations are those that
convey original English thoughts and concepts into the Chinese target
culture.In this process,translators and subtitlers even need to rewrite
aspects of the original work and this makes the language proficiency and
cultural awareness of a translator an important requirement.</p>
<p>Apart from these issues relating to cultural difference,“the speed of
the original subtitles” was a notable problem for 43% of
respondents.From a teaching perspective,this is significant because the
respondents were in the senior year of an English major programme.</p>
<p>Therefore,the discovery that nearly half of them think that the speed
of the subtitles,prepared for commercial animated films by professional
subtitling companies,is too fast suggests that their aural comprehension
skills in English are not sufficient to assist them in following the
subtitles in Chinese.This is the logical inference,bearing in mind their
responses to the second question of Section 2,where 90% of the
respondents felt that the length of the official subtitles in Chinese
was appropriate.On the one hand,it might be argued that more needs to be
done to improve the language skills of students of English at all
levels,because it is well documented that the speed of subtitles,as well
as dubbing,is consistent with authentic verbal communication in real
life.Animated films in English are appropriate learning materials for
these students to foster their professional abilities and language
skills,and the comprehension problems alluded to by an elite group of
language students at a Chinese university shed light on the scale of the
initiatives that will be required to improve the foreign language skills
of the population as a whole.Lastly,the element of “translation quality”
should also include the criterion concerning the ideal length as one of
the standards when one comments on the quality of the translated
subtitles.</p>
<p>Generally,for the subtitles with cultural elements,the cultural
barriers should be overcome by the subtitlers.A useful method is to give
much more in terms of explanations; however,the degree to which cultural
information in subtitling is enlarged is a key challenge for
subtitlers.They have to consider the readable length of the subtitle
and,at the same time,make their translation acceptable to the target
culture.Given that nearly half of the respondents had difficulty with
“the speed of the original subtitles”,this confirms that most of them
prefer to read Chinese translated subtitles,with 90% responding to
Question 2 in Part 2 that they find the current length of the released
translated subtitles acceptable.However,considering that they are young
adult people with a higher level of education in China,I think that the
current length may have more possibilities to be improved.In other
words,if the expression in the translated subtitles is studied more
carefully,the length may be shortened or the characters changed to
involve more simplified spellings,thereby enabling an audience with a
wider range of education levels to have better understand the translated
subtitles.The “different ways of thinking in English and Chinese” is
another factor that may also influence the length difference between
these two versions of subtitles because of the different customs in
terms of expressions.For example,in terms of formal expressions,the
Chinese approach to a noun phrase is “attribute+noun”,while the English
form of expression is normally “the+noun+of+noun”.Lastly,“translation
quality” is a general concept,which indicates whether the translation is
acceptable or not.Typically,the levels of acceptance may involve one of
the following: 1) if an average audience can make sense of the
translated subtitles,they will agree that the translation quality of the
subtitles is good; 2) an audience with a good educational background in
English,e.g.,young people who are college students,will read the
translated subtitles and,if they find them to be understandable and
accurate,they will think the translation quality of subtitles is
good.The length of the translated subtitle is,of course,included in this
general idea.In other words,the length of the translated subtitles is an
important criterion when creating translated subtitles.</p>
<p>The following section will examine the factors that determine whether
translated subtitles are of an acceptable length.</p>
