<h4 id="data-analysis-on-the-questionnaire">6.3　Data Analysis on the
Questionnaire</h4>
<p>As described in the previous introduction in the last chapter,the
questionnaire was answered by 100 young adults who are considered to be
the main audience for English-language animation films in the Chinese
market.There are 97 answers that proved to be effective and usable,with
the results from each part of the questionnaire shown in the following
table:</p>
<p>Questionnaire on Issues and Strategies of Movie Caption Translation
Between English and Chinese</p>
<p>Among the 15 selected pairs of subtitles in Part I,three translated
subtitles use traditional expressions; they are Questions 2,3,4 and 12
(highlighted in the above chart).</p>
<p>For Question 2,the original text is: “And replaced by a giant
inflatable replica.There is panic throughout the globe as countries and
citizens try to protect their beloved landmarks.” The released
translation is A,while B is the direct translation without using any
traditional expressions.</p>
<p>A）取而代之的竟然是一个巨大的充气仿制品。此事已引起全球恐慌，各国人民都力求保护各自的国家瑰宝。</p>
<p>(condensation,transcription)</p>
<p>(Back translation: It has been replaced by a huge inflatable
imitation,which has caused global panic,with people in different
countries trying to protect their own national treasures)</p>
<p>B）而且用了一个巨大的充气金字塔来取代它。此事让全球各国和人民恐慌，他们试图要保护自己的国家地标。</p>
<p>(Back translation: A huge inflatable pyramid has replaced the stolen
one.This has made the whole world feel panic,with people trying to
protect their own national landmarks.)</p>
<ol start="3" type="A">
<li>Your own translation: __________________________</li>
</ol>
<p>Observations： The data result of this question is that 87 out of 97
people （90%） chose option A，while 10 out of 97 （10%） chose Option
B； no one offered his/her own translation in Box C.It shows that the
majority of respondents chose the answer involving the use of
traditional Chinese expressions or idioms （all the underlined
items）.Although the lengths of these two versions are similar，the
result suggests that，in line with the younger generation’s speaking
habits，the use of idioms is preferred because they are more vivid and
readable.According to my opinion，using traditional expressions with
four-character words makes the whole translation more readable and
comprehensible.Visually，“取而代之” （replaced by） is shorter than
“用……来取代它” （replaced by using “…”） in the sentence structure.The
same function occurs in the use of “全球恐慌” in the second sentence
pattern.What is more，this translation pattern is fully equal to the
original text of “global panic”.For the third expression of “力求保护”
（try one’s best to protect），it expresses the strong determination to
search for the thief by the speaker than the use of common word
“试图找出” in the translation of B.Lastly，for the last
word，“landmarks”，the translation in A is “国家瑰宝” and the
translation in B is “国家地标”.The former one is a more artistic
description of national historical interest and belongs to traditional
expressions in Chinese； however，“国家地标” is the direct translation.I
think the latter translation is correct literally，but “地标” is an
abbreviation for “标志性建筑物” （symbolic constructions），which
belongs to academic expressions in the knowledge category of geography
and history： not every person can immediately comprehend the meaning of
“国家地标” in one or two seconds.Therefore，“国家瑰宝” is easier to make
sense of in the very short time period.</p>
<p>For Question 3,the original subtitle was “leaving everyone to wonder
if the world’s villains are responsible for this heinous crime” whereas
the given translated Chinese subtitles were:</p>
<p>D）大家都在猜测是哪个世界级的大坏蛋做了如此十恶不赦的坏事。</p>
<p>(Back translation: Everyone is guessing who will be the world’s
villains to do such heinous bad thing) [Paraphrase,localization].)</p>
<p>E）让所有人都想不到究竟是这世界上的哪个坏蛋要对这可恶的罪行负责？</p>
<p>(Back translation: No one can think out who is the villain in the
world should pay responsibility to this hateful crime?)</p>
<p>Observations： The data result for this question is that 67 out of 97
（69%） respondents chose A，while 29 people chose B； one other
provided his/her own translation in Box C.The word “heinous” is
paraphrased as a Chinese idiom，“十恶不赦”.However，Option B uses a
rhetorical question to emphasize people’s comments on this theft.I agree
with the use of this idiom in this translation，because “十恶不赦” is
used to describe the evilest person in people’s eyes，their crime cannot
be forgivable.The using of this idiom can vividly express people’s
outrage over the theft of their national landmark.Thus，although the
result shows that the majority still preferred the use of Chinese
traditional expressions and certain equivalences in translated
subtitles，others noticed the importance of the speaking tone in
expressing personal attitude or comments on some points.One respondent
translated this subtitle as：
“所有人都在猜测是哪个殿堂级恶棍会对此滔天大罪负责？” （Everybody is
guessing which of the highest-ranking villains is responsible for this
heinous crime.） In this specific translation，the first underlined
words belong to the other typical expression，which the researcher
thinks is beneficial in subtitle translation between English and
Chinese—popular expressions.These expressions will be discussed later in
the next chapter.The second expression of “滔天大罪” is a Chinese idiom
which means serious crimes.Although technically speaking，the degree of
the crime of “十恶不赦” is higher than that of “滔天大罪”，the latter
expression is also a correct translation in this subtitle； the
researcher also agrees with this translation.</p>
<p>The next question in Part I is Question 4.The subtitle was for an
interlude song with the lyric,“I’m having a bad,bad day.It’s about time
that I get my way.Steamrolling whatever I see.Freeze ray! Freeze ray!
Freeze ray! I’m having a bad,bad day.If you take it personal,that’s
okay.Watch,this is so fun to see.Despicable me.” The alternative
translations were as follows:</p>
<p>F）今天我心情很坏很坏，于是现在火力全开，眼前的一切全都碾烂。冷冻光线！冷冻光线！冷冻光线！今天我心情很坏很坏，你要因此恨我我也不会介怀。看好了，这可不好玩。因为我是个大坏蛋。（Dislocation）</p>
<p>(Back translation: Today,I feel very bad,very bad,so now I am totally
on fire,fire.I will destroy all the things in my eyes.Freeze ray! Freeze
ray! Freeze ray! Today I feel very bad,very bad,if you hate me because
of this,I won’t mind.Look carefully,this is not fun.Because I am a big
bad guy.)</p>
<p>G）今天是糟糕，糟糕，糟糕的一天。现在是随心所欲的时候了。碾碎我看见的一切。冷冻射线！冷冻射线！冷冻射线！今天是糟糕，糟糕，糟糕的一天。你要觉得这是我的事，那好吧。小心，这看着很好玩。卑鄙的我。</p>
<p>(Back translation: Today is a bad,bad,bad day.Now is the time to “go
as you-please”.I will crush all that I see.Freeze ray! Freeze ray!
Freeze ray! Today is bad,bad,bad day.If you think it is my own
business,it is okay.Watch out,this looks funny.Despicable me.)</p>
<p>Observations： Participants gave different responses to this
question.Only 44 out of 97 （45per cent） people chose option A，the
official subtitling，while 53 out of 97 （55%） people chose option
B，the direct translation.I am minded to infer that the reason why more
people chose the second option rather than the first is because the
expression in the second translation is more readable in rhyme.That said
the first translation is marked as a “dislocation”，which is a strategy
recommended by Gottlieb and，for me，applicable to the translation of
songs and poetry （see a more detailed discussion on this point in
3.5.6，pp.103-106）.However，there is still over a half of respondents
showed their preference for the second natural translation.However，from
the perspective of using traditional expressions，the above two
translations both used varied types of traditional expressions.In the
first released translation，the first bold pattern “很坏很坏” is a kind
of traditional expression in Chinese.It is a repetitive adjective
meaning “very，very bad”； the second traditional expression is a
Chinese idiom “火力全开”，which means using full power to fight.Then the
word “介怀” is an expression of Chinese archaism，which means “to bear
in mind or to remember by heart”.The use of this word makes the
translation more like a literary translation.And because this
translation is the translation to a pattern of a song in the film，the
rhyme can be shown by this traditional expression as well.In option
B，the translation is mostly word-for-word translation.There is one
Chinese idiom in this translation “随心所欲”，which equally means
“go-as-you-please”，and is a good use of traditional expression as
well.</p>
<p>For the 12th question,the subtitle was “Okay,I wasn’t going to tell
you about this yet,but I have been working on something very big!
Something that will blow this pyramid thing out of the water!” The
alternatives in Chinese were:</p>
<p>H）好吧，我当时还不想说其实我正在策划一项大工程！金字塔那事跟它根本没法比！（Paraphrase）</p>
<p>(Back translation: Ok,I wasn’t willing to tell you about this yet,but
I have been planning a big project! The pyramid thing is a piece a cake
compared to this project.)</p>
<p>I）好吧，我那时没打算跟你们说，我正在做一件大事！这件事将把金字塔的事打得落花流水。</p>
<p>(Back translation: Ok,I wasn’t going to tell you this yet,but I am
doing a big thing! This thing will shatter the pyramid thing to
pieces.)</p>
<p>Observations： The collected data for this question showed that the
absolute majority of respondents preferred A （95 out of 97 people，or
98%），while only two chose B.Technically，the first subtitled
translation uses 36 Chinese characters，whereas the second has 40
characters.Given the limits of space and time，subtitles the shorter the
better.Secondly，the underlined pattern in the first instance of
subtitling is closer to authentic oral language in Chinese，while the
expression is made stronger by using “根本没法比” than
“把……打得落花流水”，which is a traditional expression in
Chinese.Moreover，according to its literal
meaning，“把……打得落花流水”，the researcher concludes that it is more
appropriate for use in a situation involving a war or
competition，rather than to compare size or influence between two
things.Take，for
example，中国军队把日本侵略者打得落花流水，他们最终投降了。（Back
translation： The Chinese army crushed the Japanese invaders into
pieces，so that they finally surrendered）.Meanwhile，for
“根本没法比”，we might say “红队和蓝队的实力根本没法比！” （The strength
of the red team does not really compare with that of the blue
team！）.The meaning of these words is that the blue team has more
absolute strength needed to win a game when it competes with the red
team.Therefore，the first instance of subtitling is more appropriate
than the second one in the given context.</p>
<p>Then,in Part II of the questionnaire,I asked five more specific
questions and offered options for the respondents to choose.The third
question is concerned with the expression of translated subtitles from
the perspective of linguistic peculiarities and figures of speech: “Do
you like translations that make use of traditional Chinese
expressions,such as idioms,proverbs,sentences from ancient poems or
archaisms?” 85% (82 out of 97) of respondents believed that the use of
traditional Chinese expressions was effective and useful.The remaining
15% answered more conservatively,stating that,to some degree,the use of
devices such as traditional Chinese expressions and figures of speech
functioned.This result correlated with the results from the first
section of this questionnaire,given that a clear majority of respondents
preferred the evocative language resulting from the translation
strategies used in the option A subtitles,as opposed to the minority of
respondents who chose option B in 5 out of 15 questions in the first
section.Both of these two results show that culturally loaded
expressions in E-C subtitling are preferred by a majority of a typical
animated film audience.These expressions may be more attractive to the
audience because they feel the subtitles engaging with their own culture
and customs.Again,my hypothesis about the effectiveness of using
traditional and established Chinese expressions in E-C subtitling was
verified.</p>
<p>Then,in the last question in Part II of the questionnaire,I highlight
the use of traditional expressions and popular expressions as well in
the selected data.I would like to measure the respondents’ awareness and
approval of the use of this typical expression as culturally loaded ones
in subtitle translation between English and Chinese.Since the result
also involves another category of expression,the popular expression,the
data analysis on this specific question will be discussed later in the
next chapter concerning the discussion of the use of popular
expressions.</p>
<p>Lastly,in Part III,the last part of the questionnaire,the researcher
asks an open question: “In your opinion,what have been the main problems
and weaknesses that have emerged in the subtitles of recently released
animation films?” Among the summarized six keywords (have already
discussed in Chapter 4,cultural barriers,the different ways of thinking
in English and Chinese,proper nouns and translation quality are all
factors that can be dealt with by using specific traditional expressions
and strategies.For example,the first two elements concern cultural
exchange.If the subtitlers notice the cultural differences between the
source culture and the target culture,the use of traditional expressions
will be their one of concerns.Because traditional expressions in Chinese
are commonly used in real life,people won’t feel strange when they see
these expressions in the translated subtitles of a foreign
film.Conversely,they may feel acceptable when they see a film,these
translations with the use of Chinese traditional expressions may help
them better understand the film.Moreover,like the use of fourcharacter
idioms,the translated subtitles may be visually shorter,brief and
readable.Then,for the element of proper nouns,if the subtitler can find
fairly equivalent traditional expressions to translate certain patterns
of subtitles,from the perspective of translation aesthetics the
translated subtitles will be more artistic.Lastly,with regard to the
translation quality,the researcher thinks it is a general concept that
is relevant to all aspects of language translation in subtitles.If the
audience prefer translations that feature traditional expressions,this
will become one factor or criterion for judging the quality of subtitle
translation,given that the majority of those watching these translated
animation films comprises young people who have a good level of English
and use Chinese idioms and archaisms in their daily language.They may
think that the use of traditional expressions in subtitle translations
is idiomatic and closer to their own life.</p>
