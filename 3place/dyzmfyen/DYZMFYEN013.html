<h4 id="avt">2.2　AVT</h4>
<p>AVT emphasizes audiovisual dimensions of the communicative
mode.Unlike communication through other approach,such as printed
materials,audiovisual communication implies that both the aural and the
visual channels through acoustic and optical waves are simultaneously
utilized (Delabastita,1989: 196).AVT,then,stresses that supplying a
translation is contingent on meeting the needs of these channels
(Karamitroglou 2000: 2).</p>
<p>In June 2012,during an interview with visiting Dong,Diaz-Cintas was
asked which terms in his view were the most appropriate in defining the
current study area: Film Translation,Multimedia Translation,Screen
Translation or AVT.He replied,“I prefer to use ‘audiovisual
translation’,because audiovisual translation is not only about the types
of program but it also emphasizes the communication between the
translated products and the audience”.With this in mind,“audio” refers
to the information on the soundtrack,while “visual” refers to the
moving; when taken together,they should be regarded as communication
channels.Furthermore,“AVT” is a concept that is wide enough to encompass
all translation products including DVDs,films,TV programmes,and online
and mobile videos.In the history of media development,film is the main
type of translated product because it was the one that was invented
first.Therefore,in the beginning,scholars referred to this particular
type of study in terms of “Cinema Translation”.However,with the rapid
development of technology,more and more types of media have been
created.In response to this changing landscape,scholars have more
recently preferred to use the broader term “AVT”.Meanwhile,since the
late 1990s,practitioners have focused more on areas such as
“accessibility”,which is concerned with subtitling for the deaf,and the
hard-of-hearing (SDH) and audio description (AD) for the blind and the
partially sighted.In the light of this tendency,the development of AVT
has quickly diversified,with Diaz-Cintas,as one of its leading
practitioners,publishing invaluable articles and books on the topic.</p>
<p>Orero believes that “technological developments which have changed
paper oriented society towards media oriented society have also made
Audiovisual Translation the most dynamic field of Translation
Studies.”(2004: VIII)For example,in the last decade,scholars in this
area focused their attention on the study of TV subtitle translation,but
now turning their attention on subtitling in mobile videos as well as
ways in which new techniques can help them in the pursuit of better
translation strategies,such as eye-tracking and scrolling.According to
this research,there are five possible areas that can be referred to for
the purposes of examining AVT: screenplay,film adaption,audience
design,and pragmatics and poly-system theory.</p>
<p>Scholars in the West have widely and rapidly developed the study of
AVT in the last 10 years,even though the respective research
perspectives have varied.Some of them have described their studies in
terms of being based on a new means of AVT technology.Examples include
Brauna and Orero’s (2010) article,“Audio description with audio
subtitling: an emergent modality of audiovisual localization”,published
in Perspectives; and O’Hagan’s (2003) article,“Can language technology
respond to the subtitler’s dilemma? — A preliminary study”.Others have
been inclined towards cultural awareness in AVT; for example,in his
(2007) article,“Cultural interchangeability: the effects of substituting
cultural references in subtitling”,also published in
Perspectives,Pedersen discussed the interchangeability of cultural
elements in subtitling and explained the possibility of “cultural
substitution” in subtitle translation.Some,meanwhile,have given
subjective reasons behind the influences upon the quality of subtitling;
for example,in her 2008 survey-based article,“Subtitling 8 Mile in three
languages: translation problems and translator
licence”,Taivalkoski-Shilov argued that more attention should be paid to
the requirements not only of translators,but also of local managers and
subtitling coordinators in the pursuit of quality in subtitling.Using
the findings from her survey,which was based on the comparison of
Finnish,French and Russian subtitled versions of the sample film,8
Mile,the author concluded that the strict policies of some local offices
of the film’s distributor may have been an obstacle to the quality of
subtitling in certain countries.In her 2002 article,“Subtitling wit: The
case of ridicule”,Vanderschelden chose translation examples that were
focused on style,register,play on words,humour and cultural
references.In the training of subtitlers,shifting their attention
towards cultural elements and cultural components will help them make
target subtitles more acceptable to the audience.In this current
research,the importance of cultural differences found within E-C
subtitling is also the key discussion point.In the process,I will try to
identify effective strategies for subtitling by analysing the impact of
cultural differences upon subtitling.</p>
<p>In 2013,Perspectives published a special issue entitled “Corpus
Linguistics and Audiovisual Translation: In search of an integrated
approach”.In this issue,12 articles were published whose keywords were
“Corpus-based”,“Dubbing” and “Audiovisual Translation”.The authors of
these articles discussed their own research into using,and understanding
of,corpus in AVT study,the effective strategies of AVT translation from
English into their native language,cultural awareness in AVT
translation.However,when searching under “corpus-based” and “E-C
animation film subtitling”,very few studies were found.In the current
study,I will construct a parallel corpus to collect and analyse
translated Chinese subtitles and their corresponding original English
texts for the purposes of comparing the results with my research
hypotheses.</p>
