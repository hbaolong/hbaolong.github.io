<h4 id="data-analysis-on-corpus">5.2　Data Analysis on Corpus</h4>
<p>In the following stage,I need to collect data using UltraEdit and
analyse the data by using the calculating function of Microsoft Excel,as
the main means of her corpus,in order to evaluate the average length of
each of the subtitles (both of English and Chinese) in the 15 films,as
well as the average length difference between the Chinese translated
subtitles and their corresponding English original text in order to
establish whether the first of my hypotheses is positive or not.</p>
<p>In the last chapter,it was discussed that in the sample data,there
were sixty pairs extracted in a sample,the maximum value being 11 words
and the minimum value being -4 (minus four).Therefore,the average value
of difference in the 60 pairs was about 2.69.Then in this stage of the
research,I expanded the research objectives to all the subtitle pairs in
the 15 selected films.The total number of the pairs is 19,081,and
according to the comparison of these pairs,I obtained a relatively more
objective result than the “2.69” words difference from the sample 60
pairs.Her investigation procedure is as follows:Regarding the use of
Microsoft Excel,I firstly tested the length difference between two
language-versioned subtitles,as indicated in the Screenshot below:</p>
<p>Screenshot 11</p>
<p>(Subtitle pairs from The Croods,2013)</p>
<p>The subtitle pairs in each of the 15 films are collected into 15
separate Excel spreadsheets.As the above example shows,the first column
in light grey represents the set of Chinese translated subtitles; they
are ordered automatically by Excel,while the serials number shows the
total number of the translated subtitles.The second column in dark grey
shows the set of corresponding English original subtitles in this
film.Next to this is the character/word number for each single line of
subtitling.The colours show the corresponding relations.</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel helped me to calculate the numbers of these bilingual
subtitles as well as to work out the average value of English original
subtitles and that of their corresponding Chinese translated
subtitles,and then it obtained the average value of difference between
these two languages.By comparing the number of English words in each
part of the original text with the number of Chinese words in each
target subtitle on the spreadsheet,it is evident that Chinese
expressions are generally longer than English expressions; see the
following chart:In order to show the data result more clearly,I used the
generating function of Excel:</p>
<p>Screenshot 12</p>
<p>(Subtitle pairs from The Croods,2013)</p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>The line graph is more explicit than the Excel form: the dark grey
line represents the number of characters in the Chinese translated
subtitles of the 20 subtitles,the maximum number is about 23 characters
in Chinese,and the minimum value is 1,but in most cases of these twenty
pairs,when I worked out the centre shaft,the average length of the
Chinese subtitles is about 12 (11.79) numbers; however,the English
subtitles were characterized by a maximum value of around 15 and a
minimum value of 1 as the black line illustrates,and its centre shaft
runs through the number of 8 (8.32).It is a similar result to that shown
by the sample data in the last chapter.With the same way showed as the
above,I put all the bilingual subtitles of each film into one Microsoft
Excel,then by analysing all the date of 15 selected films,I found that
the Chinese translated subtitles are averagely longer than the English
original subtitles in these 15 selected films.</p>
<p>This result shows the effectiveness of her first hypothesis: the
lengths of Chinese translated subtitles are,on average,greater than
those of their corresponding English original subtitles.</p>
<p>Table 3</p>
<p>In the earlier section of this chapter,I introduced advice given to
her by theorists and practitioners about the ideal length of a
singleline subtitle in Chinese as well as in English.The standard length
of a single-line Chinese subtitle should be about 15 characters,while an
English subtitle should be within 40 characters or 15 words.The corpus
collection and analysis helped me to evaluate the chosen data,with the
result that the data are able to meet the above standards.Hence,this
strongly suggests that the official translated subtitles provided for
the released films are broadly effective.What is more,the result also
indicates that the subtitlers of the above released translated films are
aware of appropriate lengths for subtitles in their translation work,and
shows that the language and dialogue used in English animation films are
mainly brief and simple.From the above chart,the largest average value
for a single-line Chinese subtitle is to be found in Madagascar 1,with
11 characters,compared with the above-mentioned standard length in
Chinese of 13-23 characters per line).In other words,as the average
length is less than 13 characters for all the selected films,their
Chinese translated subtitles can be said to be of acceptable length.As
long as audiences have completed primary education (acquiring a
vocabulary of 2,500 words or so),such subtitles will not pose a problem
to them.As shown in the last column in the above chart,the Chinese
translated subtitles are generally greater in length than the original
dialogue in English.Among the selected animation films,the average
length difference between the translated Chinese subtitles and their
corresponding original texts range from 1.63 to 3.82 characters/words.In
Rio 1,the average length difference is 1.63,which shows that the
translated Chinese subtitles in this film have a similar length to the
original English subtitles.In the later data analysis chapter on the use
of traditional expressions and popular expressions,I found that one
reason is that the high-frequency use of these typical expressions (the
use of traditional expressions is 4.51%,which is higher than for most of
the selected films,while the use of popular expressions is 33.14%,which
is also higher than for the rest of the selected films) makes the
average length difference small (I will explain this phenomenon in
detail in the next two chapters).For example:</p>
<p>① Everyone here is on fire.5 (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>万物热情如火。6 （Released translation）（involves in the use of
idiom which is underlined）</p>
<p>Everything has high enthusiasm.(Back translation)</p>
<p>② and we’re not big on travel.7 (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>也不爱出远门。6 （Released translation）</p>
<p>And do not like on travel.(Back translation)</p>
<p>However,in Frozen,the average difference is 3.82.When evaluating the
translated subtitles and their corresponding original English texts,I
found that the highest average length difference in this film’s subtitle
translations could be determined by the presence of two songs in the
film subtitles: Frozen Heart and Let It Go.In order to explain the lines
of the songs,as well as to reflect the rhyme of the translated
lyrics,the subtitler used the strategy of expansion,meaning that the
total number of characters in the translated Chinese version is much
bigger than for the other selected films.For example:</p>
<p>① Born of cold and winter air,6 (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>它来自寒冷的冬天。8（Released translation）</p>
<p>it comes from cold winter,(Back translation)</p>
<p>② and mountain rain combining.4 (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>裹挟着山中的雨滴。8 （Released translation）</p>
<p>covered with rain drops from mountain (Back translation)</p>
<p>In general,this result proves that my first hypothesis in this study
is positive.</p>
<p>Furthermore,in the process of calculating the figures,I also recorded
the following subtitle translation phenomena:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In Turbo,there are two overlong subtitles with over 30 characters in
the Chinese version; they provide expositional information about the
story and the racing car competition.</li>
</ol>
<p>As for the first phenomenon,I concluded that,in original English
language films,English as the source language is not a very wellknown
language among the target Chinese audience.It is necessary,then,to add
several brief pieces of background information to help the audience
understand more about the characters and plots.However,if the length is
too long,the subtitles will effectively become unreadable.As analysed
before,the acceptable and readable length of a single-line Chinese
subtitle should be within 25 (as the maximum) characters; a single-line
subtitle with 31 characters will not be fully readable by ordinary
people in practice.Hence,the translation in the following two subtitles
in Turbo is less likely to be successful:</p>
<p>Translated
subtitle：让我们回到印第安纳波利斯500英里大赛的角逐现场（世界三大汽车赛事之一，简称印第500）。（37
characters）</p>
<p>Original subtitle: And we’re back at the final stretch of the
Indianapolis 500.</p>
<p>Observations: In the translated subtitle,the subtitler added a
bracket to explain the background information of the film’s setting.This
is important information; however,in order to meet the requirement of
mechanical limits of producing film subtitles,the translated subtitle
could be shorter as follows:</p>
<p>1）让我们回到这世界三大汽车赛之一的印第500比赛现场！（23
characters）</p>
<p>(Back translation: And we’re back at one of the world’s three biggest
car competitions — the Indianapolis 500.)</p>
<p>2）让我们回到世界汽车大赛之印第500英里赛的现场！（21 characters）</p>
<p>(Back translation: And we’re back at the world’s famous car
competition — the Indianapolis 500.)</p>
<p>For the first recommended translation,I directly rewrote the original
text,but provided the audience with full information about the
classification and the abbreviated name of the cars competition.This
avoids the repetitive nature of the expression used in the released
translated subtitle.As the length of the alternative translation is
shortened to 23 characters,this falls within the allowable length
according to the related subtitle theories and the recommendations of
professional subtitlers.</p>
<p>For the second recommended translation,I carried out one more
abbreviation to the original text,compared with the given released
translation.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>In Rio 1,the average number of Chinese characters in a single line
is eight,which is one character less than the average number in a
subtitle in English.This is the only result that is different from the
other data results from the other 14 films.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding this phenomenon,compared with the overlong subtitles in
Turbo,the occasional use of 24 characters in a single-line subtitle is
acceptable; however,the use of specialized terms will likely be an
obstacle preventing comprehension among some sections of the
audience,such as young primary students or others who lack specialized
knowledge; for example,terms such as “nitrous oxide”
(Turbo),“Odontophorus gujanensis” (Rio 2) and “oil pressure” (Cars
2).</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>In The Smurfs 1,the majority of conversations occur among several
characters,compared with two-character dialogue; therefore,the
translation of the subtitles in these sequences is potentially more
difficult and complex.</li>
</ol>
<p>Concerning this third phenomenon，when group conversations occur in
subtitle translation，the subtitlers have to pay close attention to the
length of the translated subtitles，for on the one hand，the translated
subtitles should match each of the speakers appearing in the frame
synchronously，while on the other hand，specific ways to make each
speaker’s words or expressions different from each other could help the
audience to follow the original story and multi-character dialogue more
easily.Therefore，in the translation of these subtitles，the subtitlers
can use a variety of translated expressions to make each character’s
speech more personalized.For example，in The Smurfs film
series，different smurfs have different personalities and their names
are given with reference to their various personalities，such as
Clumsy，Vanity and Smooth.In the released translation，these names are
translated in terms of equivalent meaning，while the form of expression
meets the custom by which Chinese parents give their children
nicknames，that is，by using reiteratives of “笨笨” （Clumsy） “靓靓”
（Vanity） and “滑滑” （Smooth）.Then，in order to show their different
personalities，the subtitlers translated their words in terms of the
respective features.For example，when translating the words for
Clumsy，simple and funny expressions were used； however，when
translating the words for Smooth，smart expressions were employed.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>In Cars 1 and 2 and Turbo,a common difficulty in the translation is
the high frequency of using mechanical terms related to autos.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally,the translated Chinese versions of these terms are longer
than the original expressions.Moreover,for some less familiar terms,the
subtitler had to add a short explanation to them in a bracket after
these terms.This makes the translated subtitles even longer than their
supposed length.For example:</p>
<p>Translated
subtitle：柠檬？（对缺陷品汽车的统称）—是啊，那些天生就带缺陷的汽车，总是这里坏那里坏的。</p>
<p>Original subtitle: Lemon? — Yeah.Cars that don’t ever work right.</p>
<p>Observations: In the translated subtitle,the subtitler explained that
“lemon” does not refer here to the original meaning of the fruit,but it
is a mechanical term related to autos; it refers to the defective
cars.Similarly,in The Smurfs 2,there is a subtitle which has 24
characters in the line because it involves the translation of some
specialized terms:</p>
<p>Translated
subtitle：这是一个有机的、无麸质、富含抗氧化剂的阿萨伊浆果蛋糕。</p>
<p>Original subtitle: This is an organic,gluten-free,antioxidantrich
acai berry cake.</p>
<p>In the translated subtitle，there are four expressions that are the
translation of specialized words.Because the released translation
completely translated the original subtitle by using equivalence to
render the four original attributes，this translation is considered as a
faithful translation.Moreover，although the length is longer than the
average length of the whole number of translated subtitles in this
film，24 characters in this line is within the limitation of 25
characters per line.However，as regards this specific subtitle，the
researcher thinks another translation might be acceptable as
well：这是一个纯天然、很健康的阿萨伊浆果蛋糕。（18 characters）（Back
translation： This is a pure nature，very healthy acai berry cake）.</p>
<p>In my translation,I avoid the translation of the first three
specialized terms of nutritional science.In fact,the basic information
to be conveyed to the common audience in this subtitle is that this is a
healthy fruit cake,because this type of story is a fairy tale,not a
scientific report.Considering the practical function of this subtitle,it
is not necessary to translate it in a scientific way.Therefore,the
advantages of the recommended translation are: a) to offer the audience
a general explanation of the features of acai berry cake; b) to shorten
the length of the released translation.However,in some places,if
cultural differences exist,the extra information becomes necessary.Take
the following from The Smurfs 2,for instance:</p>
<p>① Translated subtitle：那是蓝蓝吗？—他可真大呀。</p>
<p>Original subtitle: Is that Blue? — He’s huge.</p>
<p>西方传说：小孩子都是由鹳鸟送到父母那里的，蓝精灵也是被鹳鸟带到村庄去的。
（Extra information）</p>
<p>② Translated subtitle：哪个鹳如果被他骑着肯定要累死了。Original
subtitle： I wouldn’t want to be the stork that brought that guy.</p>
<p>Observations: Between subtitle pairs ① and ②,the subtitler added one
line of extra information to explain a Western tale,namely,that children
are delivered to their parents by storks,as are Smurfs.This added
information is necessary,because in order to understand the next
subtitle,②,the target audience should know the background story about
the storks.</p>
<p>However,fortunately,the above phenomena seldom appeared in the films
under examination,and consequently,the rarity of these phenomena does
not affect the overall quality of the translated film subtitles.But the
film subtitlers should note the differences in length between English
and Chinese expression.They can check their translation work by
referencing the average value of difference between the subtitles’
lengths in the two versions.According to Table 2,subtitles which have
more than 3 characters’ difference could be considered too brief in
translated Chinese to explain or transfer the meaning of the original
English subtitles completely; consequently,the audience would not
understand the meaning of the subtitle because of the loss of necessary
information.</p>
<p>For the other subtitles which have less than 3 characters’
difference,which may constitute a very long subtitle in the Chinese
translated version,even though the longer subtitle may offer more
detailed information to the audience,because of the space and time
limits in watching film subtitles,these translations become far less
readable.</p>
<p>As a result,intercultural communication between the audience and the
film cannot successfully happen.Only one exception can make the second
phenomenon workable; this is when translation course teachers use the
films as a teaching resource.They will need to use “the slow play” and
“pause” buttons frequently in their teaching to give students enough
time to finish reading the information in the subtitles.In this case,the
detailed explanations in the subtitles become part of a more
substantial,successful knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>To sum up,the readable length for a film subtitle is an important
technical concern in the process of making films.In the translation
between English and Chinese,the characteristics of Chinese characters
mean that translated Chinese subtitles mainly need more space,but not
necessarily more words than the original English ones.From a visual
sense,Chinese subtitles look longer and require more time to be read;
therefore,the subtitlers should be aware of this difference when
pursuing the creation of readable Chinese subtitles in their translation
work.One suggestion could be that,when subtitlers meet some long
subtitles,they can use Chinese idioms or use the translation strategies
of transcription,transfer,condensation,paraphrase to shorten the length
of their translated subtitles.The use of Chinese idioms in the
translation of E-C subtitles can effectively condense the length of the
translated subtitle,compared with the corresponding literal
translation.The use of transcription and transfer for proper nouns can
also effectively shorten the length of the translated subtitles.For
example:</p>
<p>① Yeah,it’s all about swagger.You got to puff out that chest!</p>
<p>帅气最重要，你要抬头挺胸！ 11 （Released translation involves in the
use of one new word and one idiom）</p>
<p>The most important is to be cool.You need rise your head and chest
out.(Back translation)</p>
<p>对，要很张扬的样子。你得挺起你的胸脯！16 （Direct translation）</p>
<p>Yeah,it’s all about swagger.You got to puff out that chest! (Back
translation)</p>
<p>② So,Dr.Monteiro…(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>所以，蒙特罗博士…… 7 （Released translation）</p>
<p>So,Dr.Monteiro…(Back translation)</p>
<p>所以，Monteiro博士…… 5 （Suggested translation with the strategy of
transfer to the original English name of the character）</p>
<p>So,Dr.Monteiro…(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Rio 1,2011)</p>
<p>I will discuss the effectiveness of these strategies with more
detailed examples in the next two chapters.</p>
