<h4 id="what-is-about-despicable-me-1">3.4.2　What Is About Despicable
Me 1</h4>
<p>Despicable Me 1 is about a super-villain called Gru,who adopts three
girls from an orphanage,and his rival villain called Vector.When Gru
discovers that Vector has stolen the Great Pyramid of Giza,Gru plans an
even bigger crime — to steal the Moon.But Gru is finally transformed
into a kind person because of his new life with his three adopted
daughters.The theme of this film is that humans are essentially kind
because a bad man can be reformed by “niceness”,just like innocent
children.</p>
<p>Besides,there are many cultural elements that appear in the
film.Among these cultural factors are well-known landmarks around the
world,such as the Great Pyramid of Giza,which is located in Egypt.It is
reasonable to assume that there is global recognition of landmarks such
as this,while others may not be as universally known and understood;
examples include:</p>
<p>• Gru lives in an American suburban neighbourhood surrounded by white
picket fences and flowering rose bushes,which can be argued to represent
an idyllic representation of American society.</p>
<p>• Gru wants to steal the moon in order to prove to his mother that he
is the best super-villain in the world.His mother’s dialogue is spoken
by English actress Julie Andrews,who is known for the matriarchal roles
of the eponymous nanny in Mary Poppins and Maria in The Sound of
Music,both Hollywood films.</p>
<p>• Gru tries to get a loan from the Bank of Evil.On screen,the sign
over the bank’s entrance also states “Formerly Lehman Brothers”.In
2008,the American banking giant,Lehman Brothers,filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy,an event widely accepted as a major contributing factor to
the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>• The Bank of Evil building shares similarities to the Ministry of
Magic as depicted in the Harry Potter film series,both in the style of
the pillars in the lobby,and using toilets as a method of entry.</p>
<p>• Towards the end of the film,there is a dance recital featuring a
section of the classical Russian ballet,Swan Lake.</p>
<p>In subtitle translations，these cultural elements need to be
transferred in order to deliver as much as of the source culture as
possible to the target audience.For well-known landmarks or places like
the Great Pyramid of Giza，subtitlers may only use the traditional
translation involving standard Chinese characters： “吉萨大金字塔”
（吉萨） is the standard transliteration into Chinese，while “大金字塔”
is the literal translation of “the Great Pyramid”.Besides，with the
rapid development of globalization，I will also discuss another
up-todate way of translating the names of famous places，landmarks and
commonly used people’s names in the discussion chapter in detail.</p>
<p>For the above-mentioned cultural elements,such as the Western style
of living,the identify of the dubber,the financial crisis,references to
other popular stories or films,and famous ballet music,subtitlers need
to use different methods to translate these elements if they are
embedded in the original English subtitles.</p>
<p>For examples,in the dialogue between Gru and his neighbour:</p>
<p>00:04:53,050 to 00:04:56,000</p>
<p>FYI,your dog has been leaving little bombs (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>你的狗老是在我的院子里丢炸弹（Released translation）</p>
<p>Your dog has been leaving little bombs (Back translation)</p>
<p>00:04:56,050 to 00:05:00,050</p>
<p>all over my yard and I don’t appreciate it.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>我不喜欢它这样。（Released translation）</p>
<p>all over my yard and I don’t appreciate it.(Back translation)</p>
<p>Gru refers to his yard,which in turn refers to the Western style of
living,that is,many Western people live in a house with a yard.For this
example,the literal translation of “yard” can provide direct information
on a Western-style house to the target audience.</p>
<p>Regarding a famous dubber,I am minded that,unless the original
subtitle refers to their identity,there is no need to add this
information to the translated subtitles.In Despicable Me 1,Julie Andrews
was invited to dub the voice of Gru’s mother.I suppose the reason for
this might could be because she is associated with matriarchal roles and
may leave the audience with an impression of a strict mother.So,in order
to show how Gru is constrained by his mother and how much he would like
to prove himself to her,the film director invited Andrews to dub her
voice.If the way in which the original subtitles about Gru’s mother were
translated emphasized her characteristics,such that the target audience
recognize how strict a mother she is,the subtitlers succeed with their
translation.</p>
<p>As for the reference to the “Lehman Brothers”,subtitlers could have
added a short note to explain what this means.Brief information can help
a target audience to better understand the corresponding picture in the
film.</p>
<p>For cultural elements,such as classic plots in other famous films and
world-famous artworks,subtitlers can use the method of adding a brief
note in the lower part of the screen when the corresponding picture
appears in order to remind the audience of the provenances of these
elements.</p>
<p>However,subtitlers should ensure that the length of the added note is
readable.I have referenced and analysed the readable length of subtitles
both in Chinese and in English in the literature review.To add a note to
explain some cultural element is a kind of “expansion” in subtitling.But
the words in subtitles have the feature of instantaneity: they are
unlike those in books and,as such,the audience may not get a chance to
reread them.Even with such a small number of examples from Despicable Me
1,it can be argued that the main challenge facing AVT subtitling is to
convey meaning effectively and comprehensively within the technical
constraints of film subtitles.Therefore,the strategies that can be used
in subtitling,especially E-C animation filmsr,need to be discussed.</p>
<p>In the literature review,I referred to Gottlieb’s typology,which is
considered to be the most complete set of subtitle translation
strategies,albeit in the context of subtitle translations between
English and Danish.In the following sections,I use my analysis of the
subtitling in Despicable Me 1 in order to identify feasible strategies
from Gottlieb’s typology and explain the limits of other strategies.</p>
