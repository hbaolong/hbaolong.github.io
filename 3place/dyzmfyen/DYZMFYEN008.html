id="theoretical-framework-and-methodologies-of-this-research">1.4　Theoretical
Framework and Methodologies of This Research</h4>
<p>In reviewing the development AVT studies both in European countries
and in China,I found that every theoretical framework should have its
own model and paradigm.The function of the paradigm is usually to
certify,deduce or demonstrate whether the system is reasonable as a
whole,as well as whether it is consistent with each component.At the
same time,this paradigm can help users to elucidate,deepen and develop
these theoretical frameworks in order to identify the most efficient and
objective translation method in human communication.There ought to be no
exceptions where E-C translation is concerned.As such,I seek to pursue
an effective theoretical framework,coupled with efficacious translation
strategies,in E-C film subtitling from the perspective of cultural
difference.</p>
<p>My reason for highlighting Even-Zohar’s (1978) polysystem theory is
that I consider the subtitle translation of English animation films as a
“polysystem”,in which the features of the translated Chinese subtitles
(besides its natural features,the receptor’s language preference and
literacy level should also be considered) are present.Further,the
comparison between the target language and original language,as well as
effective strategies,is a factor within the polysystem.Moreover,in
reference to Gottlieb’s (1992) typology,I selected and analysed four
effective strategies in E-C subtitle translation,as well as discussed
two newer and feasible strategies,with a view to improving the quality
of Chinese subtitle translations for English animation films.</p>
<p>The methods used in this research may reflect a broadly qualitative
approach to the research.The primary method is a self-built parallel
corpus.I have chosen the corpus method because it is considered to be
“an influential empirical research model” in translation studies and “a
resource for evaluating translation” (Ma and Miao 2009: 336).In the
early stage of this current research,I contacted Huang,one of the most
highly regarded scholars in the field of corpus-based studies based in
China,by email in order to ask for advice.On his advice,I attended a
summer course in Beijing in 2015 given by Liang and Xu (these three
scholars’ suggestions will be explained later in the book; the interview
transcripts and related information about them can be found in Appendix
V).Inspired by these professionals’ advice and the content of the summer
course,I established my preliminary ideas for establishing a corpus for
my particular research,namely,to build up a corpus,which serves to
investigate E-C film subtitling from the perspective of “translation
universals” within the corpus translation,consists of 15 popular English
language feature-length animations translated for the mainstream Chinese
market.Its construction allows the original text to be compared
alongside the translated subtitles.By using the software of
UltraEdit,Paraconc,Excel and its automatically generated charts,I have
obtained clear and reliable data,which assist me in the completion of
this research and its findings.The self-built parallel corpus (the
complete corpus is in Appendix VI) contains 19,081 pairs of bilingual
subtitles from the 15 selected animation films; the corpus is also
designed to be expandable in the context of future studies,which might
seek to develop a bigger corpus and uncover more findings in this field
of study.However,in the current corpus,I dealt with the following: 1) to
align each pair of subtitles; 2) to calculate the length of each
subtitle; 3) to calculate the frequency of the use of traditional
expressions; 4) to calculate the frequency of the use of popular
expressions.Then,I obtained the following results from the corpus:1) the
length difference between each subtitle pair (the original English pair
and the corresponding translated Chinese pair); 2) the frequency of the
use of traditional expressions; 3) the frequency of the use of popular
expressions.In turn,these research results confirmed my three
hypotheses: 1) the length of the translated Chinese subtitles is
generally greater than the corresponding original English ones; 2) the
frequency of the use of traditional expressions,the degree of the film
popularity and the performance of the film ticket sales are in direct
proportion to each other; 3) the frequency of the use of popular
expressions,the degree of the film popularity and the performance of the
film ticket sales are in direct proportion to each other.In other
words,the results for 2 and 3 confirm that the use of these two tested
expressions is effective at improving the quality of the released
subtitle translation.Then,in the further step,I analysed the subtitle
pairs that involve the use of common and popular expressions,identified
several types of issues in the given data and made suggestions for
improving imperfectly translated subtitles.</p>
<p>I have also chosen to incorporate a questionnaire exercise into the
project (The complete questionnaire form is in Appendix I),which I use
as a supplementary method.According to Mackey and Gass (2005: 92),a
questionnaire can help researchers obtain first-hand data from
appropriately selected groups.For this project,the functions of the
questionnaire are further identified: 1) the “imperfections”/issues in
the translation of the 15 selected animations’ subtitles; 2) possible
explanations for these “imperfections”/issues; and 3) whether I proposed
“translation strategies” might enhance the quality of AVT,and E-C in
particular,in the future.The use of the questionnaire helped me to
identify pertinent issues more clearly,as well as determine effective
strategies for improving translation quality.</p>
<p>In addition,in order to support the above methods and to confirm the
validity of the research hypotheses,several interviews (the complete
record of interviews is in Appendix III) with several scholars and
practitioners may become another kind of qualitative evidence.These
interviews helped me to collect detailed answers relevant to the
specific research hypotheses.</p>
