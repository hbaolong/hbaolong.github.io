<h4 id="rationale-of-corpus">4.2.1　Rationale of Corpus</h4>
<p>Toury emphasizes the significance of empirical research by suggesting
that:</p>
<p>the introduction of empirical methods proved to be a true landmark in
the evolution of the discipline…and the greatest contribution of
experimentation lies precisely in its potential for shedding new light
on the interdependencies of all factors which may act as constraints on
translation and on the effects of these interdependencies on the
process,its products,and the functions which any of them may serve in
the recipient culture,and in increasing their predicative
capacity.(1995: 221-222)</p>
<p>Ma and Miao explain that an empirical model of translation studies
should be improved through the observation,description and analysis of
phenomena in translation,which not only leads to the empirical
accumulation of knowledge,but also makes translation studies descriptive
and multidisciplinary (2009: 336).Within current translation studies,an
increasing number of scholars have shown interest in carrying out
research into such issues as “translation universals” using corpus
translation.From 1993 onwards,corpus linguistics has developed rapidly
thanks to scholars such as Baker,Laviosa,Shlesinger and Zanettin et
al.all of whom began to use corpora as a tool to investigate translation
at both a descriptive and practical level (Baker 1993,Laviosa
1998,Shlesinger 1998,Zanettin et al.2007).</p>
<p>In current manifestations of translation research,there are four
types of electronic corpora that are specifically useful:
namely,parallel corpora,comparable corpora,monolingual corpora,and
multilingual corpora.</p>
<p>According to Baker,corpora applied in translation studies refer to
“collections of texts held in machine-readable form and capable of being
analysed automatically or semi-automatically in a variety of ways”
(1995: 225).</p>
<p>Corpus-based translation studies is a newly developed field based on
the theories of corpus linguistics,linguistics and translation
studies,and mainly focuses on investigating authentic bilingual language
data by using computer applications to analyse and calculate probability
and statistics.According to Wang,“the development of corpusbased study
and bilingual corpora in particular,may help Descriptive Translation
Studies develop in a deeper way” (2006: 6).</p>
<p>Baker is considered to have been the first scholar to introduce the
corpus as a research method in translation studies.She applied the
research method of corpus linguistics study to the collection of a great
deal of authentic translation materials,and in turn she described the
nature of translation and even established many regulations and norms of
translation.Baker pointed out that,with the development of corpus-based
translation studies,scholars may use the comparison of the original
language text and the translated language text to explain the
communication role of the translated text in the nature of translating
(1993: 243).Baker’s idea led scholars to certify,modify and clarify the
nature of translation in order to better describe the nature of
translation.</p>
<p>Baker divided the corpora of translation studies into three main
types: parallel corpora,multilingual corpora and comparable corpora
according to different study purposes (1995: 230).Parallel corpora
highlight the differences between the original text and the translated
text at the level of lexis,sentences or paragraphs.The second type of
corpora is multilingual corpus.It is normally a collection of two or
more versions of text; they are all original texts as opposed to
translated ones.This type of data collection can be regarded as a kind
of pure “parallel corpora” that offers information to scholars and
enables them to tell the difference in writing styles between each
text,and helps them to set up criteria to evaluate the quality of
translation.Last but not least,comparable corpora refer to two
independent collections of texts in the same language; for example,texts
originally produced in a given language (English),and texts translated
into the same language (English).Scholars can test their theoretical
hypotheses through vast computer-stored collections of comparable
texts,which can easily reveal the distinctive linguistic features of
translated texts.They can also offer learners a better comprehension,not
only of target but also of source texts,allowing them to compare
language and cultures in terminology,phraseology and textual
conventions.Comparable corpora may help scholars to indicate the
universality of translation.It is clear that the application of corpora
not only supplies translation scholars with empirical research tools to
investigate the nature of translation and describe the features of
translated texts,but it also provides practical translators with an
invaluable tool in their practical work.</p>
<p>According to Ma and Miao,</p>
<p>parallel corpora consist of original texts and their translated
texts.They can be used to provide information on specific language-pair
translational behaviour,to positcertain equivalence relationship between
lexical items or syntactical structures in the two languages
concerned,or to explore the phenomenon of translationese.They can also
offer translation learners the possibility to observe what strategies
translators appear to privilege,and to learn how to overcome specific
translation problems based on their observation.(2009: 356)</p>
<p>The acknowledged advantage of corpus is its “data-driven feature
[that] helps researchers conduct their investigation from the bottom
up,using concrete facts to make generalizations about languages”,which
can be tested repeatedly in order to avoid subjectivity and randomness
in the process of study (Baker,1996: 186).In particular,the use of
corpus in translation studies,such as in relation to film subtitling,can
enable researchers to find some peculiar semantic features,differences
in the style of the texts or language customs,differences in the length
between the original versions and the translated
manifestations,co-occurrence,coherence,and even the distinctive features
of using punctuation within the translation.However,the disadvantages
are also obvious.On the one hand,the data collection process is labour
and time intensive.Any researcher copiously needs to transfer the format
of the selected texts in order to meet the requirements for collecting
data in the corpus.On the other hand,most scholars tend to proceed with
their research from the top down in order to find evidence in support of
their abstract hypotheses (ibid: 186).Therefore,the use of corpus
requires the researchers’ patience and intelligence.I think with full
preparation works,these difficulties are resolvable.</p>
<p>The development of parallel corpus studies in European countries is
at a mature stage.Meanwhile,in China,the study of corpus linguistics and
corpus translation has developed very rapidly in the last 10 years.The
most common types of corpus undergoing development are general
corpus,specialized corpus,synchronic corpus,diachronic corpus,and
learner corpus (Liang et al.2013: 4-5).Although some of these corpora
can be found online (e.g.,http://mtgroup1ict1ac1cn/corpus),these corpora
rarely meet the needs of language scholars because of the limited data
that is available to the public.Moreover,instances of E-C parallel
corpora are even rarer,particularly in relation to the subtitling of
animation films.</p>
<p>In this research,I have opted to set up a self-built corpus in order
to compare the original subtitles and the translated subtitles in my
selection of 15 feature length animation films.The purpose behind this
discussion of suitable translation strategies is to take a scientific
approach with a view to identifying “subtitling universals”,particularly
in relation to E-C subtitling.</p>
<p>In the introduction chapter of this book,I explained my research
purpose and hypotheses.I plan to test and evaluate all of these
hypotheses using the chosen methodologies.The self-built corpus will
help to evaluate the effectiveness of the first hypothesis (about the
length difference between the translated Chinese subtitles and their
corresponding English original texts) and analyse the proportions of the
use of traditional expressions and popular expressions in the data.</p>
