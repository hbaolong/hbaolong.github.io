<h4 id="data-result-of-lnterviews">6.4　Data Result of lnterviews</h4>
<p>Moreover,from September 2015 to March 2016,I carried out a series of
fact-finding visits and interviews at Shanghai Translated Film
Studio,which is the second biggest official translated film workshop in
China.In the course of this investigation,I reviewed translated
subtitles of films from the past five years and interviewed three active
subtitlers.When discussing awareness regarding the use of Chinese
traditional expressions in the subtitlers’ work,each of them related
details of their own working experience.Although they are happy to share
their working experiences for the benefit of the current research,they
would like the following comments to be anonymously recorded; because
they thought their works are team work,they prefer to be anonymous in
this book.Their specific comments are as follows:</p>
<p>One said he began using this kind of expression in 2005,which was his
second year of working in this company.He carried out a survey in
certain cinemas,finding that audiences had a more enjoyable experience
when they read and heard Chinese traditional expressions in a foreign
film.The second subtitler had collected online feedback from audiences
about translated film subtitles,concluding that the turning point in the
development of translated film subtitling occurred with Garfield
(2005).In this film,the translated subtitles comprised more than 34% of
expressions that were culturally loaded Chinese words,including
traditional expressions and popular Internet words (one kind of popular
expressions which will be discussed in the next chapter).Over 32% (2,810
out of 8,769) of netizens (net citizens) stated that they had noticed
these expressions,while 60% (168 out of 281) indicated their preference
for these kinds of expressions.</p>
<p>It also needs to be mentioned here that the researcher searched
online,on reputable Chinese academic websites such as
www.lunwenqikan.net and www.cnki.net,where she found 23 papers from the
past five years,which discussed the translation in Garfield,whereby the
two main discussion points were traditional expressions and popular
Internet expressions.For instance,in Xiao’s dissertation (2012: 33),he
emphasized the success of using culturally loaded expressions in
subtitling of Garfield 2; in Tian’s view (2013: 39),the purpose of
subtitle translation is to help the target audience comprehend the
film,so the culturally loaded expressions in the target
language,together with some specific strategies in the subtitling may
have a positive effect in terms of helping the target audience to better
understand the film.</p>
<p>For example,as manifestations of culturally loaded words,Chinese
idioms help the expression to be symmetrical in structure,as
demonstrated in the following:</p>
<p>Same difference,I rule,yes? (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>大同小异，我说了算，对吧？（Released translation）</p>
<p>Same difference,I rule,right? (Back translation)</p>
<p>The underlined idiom explains the expression of “same difference” and
makes the structure symmetrical.Moreover,for Chinese audiences,the use
of Chinese idioms may make watching foreign films more culturally
acceptable,because the use of such idioms often occurs in their everyday
life.Indeed,Wang (2008: 36) pointed out that “a good quality of subtitle
translation can definitely help the exported film win popularity in its
foreign markets”.The other subtitler said that she always has two
particular reference books by her side when she is working: 300 Chinese
Ancient Poems (by Zeng,published in 2010 by the Publishing House of
Jiangsu Province) and Chinese Idiom Stories (by the Shanghai People’s
Fine Arts Publishing House,from 1952,published in 2007).She said
that,although these two books belong to the teenage reader group in
China,they are very helpful in her practical work.She thinks they are
suitable for her because her translation style pursues simple but
effective expressions.</p>
<p>Besides the three teammates’ practical comments,the leaders of the
team,famous subtitlers in this company,expressed ideas similar to those
of their team members once they accepted an interview from Shanghai ACME
Translation Co.Ltd.The team leader,Gu,together with his
teammates,finished the subtitle translation of Garfield 2.His idea of
putting many popular expressions (this type of expression will be
discussed in the next chapter) into the film translation made this film
subtitling become a hot topic at that time in China.According to
Gu,audiences have commented that “this translation of the film really
moved the audience to the bottom of their heart” (Gu,cited in Wang
2012).However,he also emphasized the “degree” of this kind of expression
being used in subtitle translation.He was worried that the excessive use
of this kind of expression would also arouse the dislike of the
audience.Another practical subtitler named Lu shared her experience of
subtitling as: the subtitling should obey the original meaning of the
language and culture; the subtitlers need not to do too much rewriting
or recreating.They should find the equivalence as much as possible,and
then consider how to insert the culturally loaded expressions to
highlight the subtitling.</p>
<p>Generally,for the second hypothesis in this research,the interviewees
discussed their understanding of the use of traditional expressions in
subtitle translation.Some of them had already noticed the importance of
using traditional expressions in their translation by certain specific
strategies.For instance,one scholar mentioned the use of traditional
expressions,such as Chinese idioms,which can make the translated
subtitle shorter; this is a typical manifestation of the strategy of
condensation.Others think that the expansion involved in using Chinese
archaisms can offer more information to the audience,but that the
subtitlers should be more careful when using such expansion: on the one
hand,they have to consider the length limits problems; on the other,they
need to ensure that the use of these traditional expressions is
appropriate when transferring one culture to another,because misusing
them in an inappropriate place may influence the delivery of the source
culture.Therefore,my suggestion in this context is to use traditional
expressions when subtitling,because this reflects current professional
practice and elicits audience satisfaction; the subtitling is
appropriate to the audience,while the translation is made more
acceptable and meaningful to the target culture.As such,the use of
traditional expressions is necessary.</p>
<p>Thus,the questionnaire survey and the above interviews help me
collect concrete data for my research.As for the second hypothesis,in
the next section I plan to discuss the importance of using traditional
expressions in subtitle translations of English and Chinese.</p>
<p>In the next section,more specific examples will be collected from the
different 15 selected films.I will observe them and discuss the
imperfections of the translations in order to suggest the effective ways
of using traditional expressions to improve the quality of Chinese
translated subtitles.</p>
