<h4 id="further-evaluation-of-the-corpus-data-results">7.4　Further
Evaluation of the Corpus Data Results</h4>
<p>In order to further test the relations between the use of these
expressions and the popularity of the films,I collect some evidence from
the Internet.According to the findings of this study,these 15 films all
used culturally loaded expressions in their translation from English
into Chinese; later,when they were released to the public,they gained
praise with regard to their language quality.I collected the grades to
the 15 selected films from three different popular websites (please see
the examples as the three screenshots below),all of which have
significant community of netizens and are approved websites in
China.</p>
<p>Screenshot 16</p>
<p>(http://www.iqiyi.com/)</p>
<p>The first website to be introduced is called “Aiqiyi”
(iQIYI.COM),which is the Pinyin name of this website.This website is an
approved website in Beijing.According to the Senior Vice President of
iQIYI,Yang Xianghua (Donews 2015),there were over 10 million iQIYI club
members in 2015.In the context of this current research project,it is
arguable that the bigger the number of the club members,and the more
people there are to grade films,the more reliable and objective the
results are likely to be for me to reference because of the large sample
of opinions involved.</p>
<p>Screenshot 17</p>
<p>(https://movie.douban.com/)</p>
<p>The second selected website was registered and approved in Beijing in
2005.According to its official data,by 2013,it had over 200 million club
members.The scale of its membership is so great that it offers me
relatively objective data results on the grades for each released
film.</p>
<p>Screenshot 18</p>
<p>(http://v.qq.com/)</p>
<p>Last but not least is Tencent,which is one of the biggest Internet
service providers in China.Established in 1998 by Ma Huateng and four
other people,its service types include different kinds of social
media,such as Internet software (QQ,QQ Space),mobile apps
(WeChat,Tencent News),which are now used widely by Chinese people in
their daily life,meaning that it is difficult to obtain precise data on
its members.Therefore,the participants on this website are theoretically
considered as the most significant in terms of numbers among the three
chosen websites.</p>
<p>I collected grades for the 15 selected films in her study,and then
calculated the average values for each film in order to see if the
translated language quality can influence the grade of each film.Grades
for the same film were compared among these three websites,with the
average values showing a relatively objective result as follows:</p>
<p>Table 11</p>
<p>According to the above data,the film Rio 1 got the highest average
grade among the 15 films in the three biggest official websites.Then the
second highest is Madagascar 3.It is an associated fact that Rio 1 is
the film with the highest frequency of using popular expressions in the
translated subtitles,while Madagascar 3 is the film with the highest
frequency of using traditional expressions in the translated
subtitles.Therefore,I assume that the use of two such kinds of
culturally loaded expressions in E-C subtitle translation may appeal to
the audience.However,the use of these two types of expression in the E-C
subtitle translation of animation films may affect the overall quality
of the subtitle translation,but it is not the decisive factor when it
comes to the overall translation quality.See the grade for the film
Turbo; although this film earned a place in the top five highest ticket
sales in its year of release,the netizens gave a relatively lower grade
to this film.The reasons may be varied,because a good quality film is
composed of many kinds of factors and elements.From this research,the
use of typical Chinese culturally loaded expressions in subtitle
translation is,at least,positive from the perspective of intercultural
communication.</p>
<p>Moreover,as the following curve graph shows,there are three curves
representing the grades on each of the three official websites
respectively.According to their trends,it shows that the grades for the
15 selected films on the three official websites are similar;
therefore,this consistency indicates a certain accuracy and precision
across these grades.In other words,they are reliable and valuable data
for this current research.</p>
<p>Figure 6</p>
<p>On the above websites,after registering as members,viewers have the
chance to give grades to the films they watch,whether they saw them at
the cinema or online.Since these three websites are officially approved
in China,the English-language films on their website contain the
officially released translation.These websites encourage their customers
to mark all the films they release.See the following screenshot:</p>
<p>Screenshot 19</p>
<p>The upper circle marks the place where the audience grades the films
they have watched,while the lower circle shows the two ways in which to
add more detailed comments or suggestions to these films.With one click
in the orange-coloured area,more detailed directions about how to grade
a film is given.The main areas that the participants should consider
while grading are: story,picture,language,music and theme.These are
appropriate criteria,which correspond to the important components of
film quality,according to Jia (2010: 185),Mtime (website) and Douban
(website).Since the highest possible grade is 10 points,each criterion
carries a maximum of two points,so that participants can give a grade
from 0 to 2 for each area; the overall grade equals the total for all
the five phases.Therefore,the 15 selected films received a good grade in
the film ranking list on average,since most of them received over 7.0
points.The high grades given by a significant number of netizens suggest
that these films are of a good overall quality.What is more,considering
that these films are all foreign films,the translation of the subtitles
should shoulder more importance compare with home produced
films.Audiences of foreign films may pay more attention to the quality
of the translated subtitles no matter if their English level is good or
not.Because,for people with a good level of English,their English
comprehension is good,their own English ability is good,and they may
have a corresponding expectation regarding the translation of the
subtitles.Therefore,for this kind of audience,when they mark the
film,the language criterion may have more relevance for them; however,as
for the audiences whose English is not good enough,they may totally rely
on the translated subtitles.If the quality of the subtitles is not good
enough,they will be influenced in understanding the film.Therefore,the
quality of the translated subtitles may also be key criterion when they
mark the film.Above these two phases of reversing consideration,the
researcher can put forward a tentative hypothesis that the higher graded
films may have a better quality of subtitling.</p>
<p>In order to verify the tentative research result,I,firstly,read and
calculated the specific comments from the netizens who took part in the
grading online.Over 32% (2,810 out of 8,769) of netizens (net citizens)
commented on the point of subtitling quality.The keywords used to
comment on the meaning behind the subtitling translation are
“funny”,“popular Internet words” and “the use of idioms”.They noticed
the use of culturally loaded expressions and there were 60% (1,680 out
of 2,810) of participants who indicated their preference for these kinds
of expressions.The second point in favour of this hypothesis is from two
scholars and practitioners of subtitle translation.The discussion with
these two scholars helped me to collect reliable effective qualitative
data to further verify my third hypothesis.</p>
