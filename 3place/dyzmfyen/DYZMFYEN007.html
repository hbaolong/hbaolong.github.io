<h4 id="research-hypothesesdata-and-objectives">1.3　Research
Hypotheses,Data and Objectives</h4>
<p>Hypotheses</p>
<p>From the perspectives of language peculiarities and cultural
differences,I will carry out the study in relation to the following: 1)
the visual difference between translated Chinese subtitles and their
corresponding original texts; 2) the features of the translated Chinese
subtitles in terms of both linguistics and cultural
difference.Therefore,in order to identify the feature differences
between the target language and the original language,the research
hypotheses are: 1) that the length of film subtitles translated into
Chinese is generally greater than the corresponding original English
texts; 2) that effective translation is contingent on the use of
traditional expressions (e.g.,Chinese idioms and archaisms) within the
translated subtitles; and 3) that effective translation is contingent on
the use of popular expressions (e.g.,popular language in networks,new
words,loaning words,dialects) within the translated subtitles.</p>
<p>Data</p>
<p>The primary data for this research are 15 animation films with the
total number of 19,081 subtitle pairs,which I have selected on the basis
that they were the most popular film releases in the Chinese translated
animation film market in the last decade.They all enjoyed higher ticket
sales than others released at the same time.The data in the study
contain both English and Chinese subtitles for these animations within a
self-built parallel corpus.In so doing,I have compartmentalized the key
cultural elements that might influence the quality of AVT
(E-C),linguistically and culturally,while aiming to discuss the most
effective strategies in the practice of AVT.The main cultural elements
are the names of characters,names of places,food,historical
figures,Chinese idioms and archaisms,customs,and contemporary
vernacular,such as language popularized networks.In the analysis,each
cultural element is collected from the original data and classified into
different categories.Each category is discussed in detail.The
descriptive method of analysis for these cultural elements is critical
for my identification of effective typologies from the perspective of
cultural awareness.</p>
<p>As stated in the previous section,the 15 animation films were
selected as a result of being the top five highest grossing English
animation films over the same year of release in the Chinese market,as
well as pulling in the largest audiences.Moreover,in narrative
terms,they all provide an uplifting theme with regard to all cultural
elements in the story centring on the main characters’
personalities,places,storylines,plots etc.The bilingual subtitles in
these films highlight the main obstacles,which,according to this
study,face practitioners of E-C subtitling.A list of the 15 films and
their bilingual titles are provided in the following table below:</p>
<p>Table 1</p>
<p>Building on the findings of pioneering scholars,I have chosen to
concentrate on subtitling,an audiovisual mode,found in 15 popular
animation films.The criteria for inclusion in my selection of these 15
films are:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>These are all imported original English animations films released
in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) (Version type: translated
Chinese subtitles and original English dubbing).</p></li>
<li><p>The years of release of these films are all after 2005.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of these 15 films was in the top five for the highest ticket
sales in the year it was released according to the data of the official
website (http://58921.com/).</p></li>
<li><p>I watched these films as a mainstream spectator and parent at the
cinema and an observer of Fengxing (http://www.fun.tv/),one of the most
popular video websites in China,which has more than 700 million
users.</p></li>
<li><p>That animation films are increasingly popular because of the
uplifting themes they explore.For example,the film Despicable Me 1 tells
the story of a notorious supervillain,Gru,who initially adopts three
orphaned girls to facilitate his criminal
objectives.Eventually,however,the girls’ innocence arouses true love in
Gru towards them,such that,by the end of the film,he assumes a sincerer
paternal role.The film’s theme of the redemption of a character whose
better qualities finally emerged resonated with audiences and moved
them.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The objective behind this study is to make the following
contributions to knowledge:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>To construct a corpus of 15 popular English language animated
films,which were subtitled into Chinese,by calculating the collected
data in order to find out the exact proportions of the use of typical
expressions,as well as those of popular expressions.I feel that this
number of films would be sufficient in order to identify the main
strategies and current practices of Chinese subtitlers.This analysis of
15 key films ought to serve as a useful basis for more extensive studies
in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>To deepen current AVT theory and develop,through testing,an
appropriate theoretical framework,which will enhance the effectiveness
of the subtitling of E-C animation films; for example,the development of
effective translation strategies and the effectiveness of using
culturally loaded expressions (traditional expressions,such as Chinese
idioms,archaisms,popular expressions used in social networks; neologisms
evolving out of everyday life situations).</p></li>
<li><p>To discuss and analyse the use of culturally loaded expressions
in the form of traditional expressions as well as popular expressions;
in short,the use of modes of language,which are underpinned by an
awareness of cultural elements and forms.This will include identifying
pertinent phenomena in the released translations for the selected 15
animation films and how they could be improved.</p></li>
