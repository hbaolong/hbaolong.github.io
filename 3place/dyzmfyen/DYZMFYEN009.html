<h4 id="significance-of-the-study">1.5　Significance of the Study</h4>
<p>AVT is a new area of study within translation studies.Scholars from
Western countries were the first to undertake theoretical work regarding
translation.Examples include Even-Zohar’s polysystem theory (1978) in
relation to the field of AVT (Karamitroglou,2000).Meanwhile,scholars
from the field of subtitle translation,such as Gottlieb,have proposed
translation strategies in the area of AVT.I intend to build on and
develop these theoretical precedents in order to highlight common
approaches and identify effective strategies relating to E-C film
subtitling.However,the challenges facing a project of this kind can be
anticipated from the very beginning,not least in light of the fact that
English and Chinese belong to different language families;
therefore,finding an “equivalent” translation between these two
languages is much more difficult than two languages from the same
family.Moreover,there are always considerable challenges when delivering
information from source text to target text because of the huge culture
gap between orient and occident.Thus,the realistic contribution of this
book will be to elevate the discussion of common issues and suitable
strategies in the process of E-C film subtitling,as well as extending
the theory into a new area.</p>
<p>What is novel about this research is that it seeks to provide
subtitlers with effective and referable strategies in order to improve
the quality of subtitling,particularly in relation to animation films in
English.There are three kinds of significance that this research should
successfully accomplish.</p>
<p>In the first instance,given that subtitling is a new branch in
audiovisual study,the related theoretical foundations are still in the
process of being constructed.According to the existing body of work
within the literature review,the achievements to date in this
field,especially in the study of E-C subtitle translation of animation
films,are very limited.I made a series of findings through the current
research,findings from which hypotheses could be developed,which may,in
turn,provides new points of reference in the study of E-C subtitle
translation of animation films.It is envisaged that this study will make
a useful contribution to the field of AVT in a Chinese context,as well
as inform future work by other scholars.In addition,it will hopefully
inspire the much broader,but nonetheless related,research interests of
other scholars.</p>
<p>Another significance of this study concerns the commercial
benefits.It is arguable that animated films are primarily commercial
products within a market place.Producers and sponsors of a film regard
income generation as their main objective.In light of the rapid economic
growth in the last century,every country is in the business of gaining a
foothold in the international market for all of its respective
products.Film,as a main form of entertainment,is welcomed by most people
into their daily lives.As such,best practice in subtitling is a critical
factor if imported films are to enjoy the best box office receipts in a
distribution schedule.Concerning English language animation films,which
are exported into the Chinese market,the most significant audience
constituency is inevitably going to be young people.They represent the
demographic group that is likely to have benefited from a higher level
of education and they are more adept at learning new
cultures.Hence,their expectations for a translated film are higher than
those of the rest of the general public.To satisfy the greater needs of
this particular audience,the burden on subtitlers is correspondingly
heavier.As such,the quality of subtitling is critical to retaining a
young audience for English language animation films.During this research
project,I organized a session during which 100 college students,aged
21-24 years and majoring in English,completed her specially designed
questionnaire.The main reasons for choosing this group of people as the
subjects for this exercise are as follows: firstly,people in this age
range are considered to be one of the main audience groups for English
language animation films in China (according to the researcher’s
previous research into the audience composition for English language
animation films); secondly,college students should have a good level of
English proficiency due to their educational background,meaning that
they ought to be able to answer a series of technical questions centring
on their preferences for certain translation strategies.</p>
<p>Thirdly,as an intercultural communication tool,exported films can be
a country’s “business card” to the world.Therefore,the translation of
subtitles is a critical factor in this regard given that the quality of
the translation will directly influence the accuracy in conveying the
original information in a film.If the subtitling can help the target
audience better or even fully comprehend the theme of a film,this in
turn ought to enable the target audience to correctly appreciate the
culture embedded in it at the same time.For example,Monsters University
(2013) was introduced to Chinese audiences in August 2013.It depicts the
American way of making friends in a university,as based on mutual
tolerance and embracing difference,along with an emphasis on the
importance of individual development in a higher education
setting.However,in Chinese culture,the traditional and expected way of
making friends is to be modest and prudent,while seeking out
like-mindedness.Therefore,in the process of watching the film,the target
audience may easily notice the cultural differences.The film’s subtitle
translators may also have their own perspective on the cultural
differences on display,or even choose different methods of translation
to meet the varying needs of the different groups of audience.For
example,for the general public,some kind of introduction to the original
culture ought to be appropriate through the strategies of
paraphrase,transfer,localization etc.,which can help with
understanding,while,at the same time,providing an opportunity to
introduce American campus culture to young Chinese people.The audience
ought to gain an intuitive insight into aspects of American university
life,such as how to survive and make friends on campus.During the course
of the current research,I analysed 15 commercially successful English
language animation films,concluding that the more popular the film
became,the more cultural elements could be found in the subtitling,such
as more diverse characters,wittier dialogues and richer
plots.Moreover,when subtitling involves the translation of cultural
differences,several specific kinds of translation strategy need to be
used to convey particular expressions.Details of these types of
expressions and translation strategies will be explained and discussed
in each of the corresponding chapters of this book.</p>
<p>In light of the three types of significance outlined above,I am
persuaded that the remit of this project is significant,such that its
findings ought to make a meaningful academic contribution at both a
theoretical and practical level.</p>
