<h4 id="description-of-the-questionnaire">4.5.2　Description of the
Questionnaire</h4>
<p>Based on the introduction of research hypotheses and research
purposes in the previous chapters,the questionnaire is considered as
supplementary to the results emanating from the corpus.According to the
data analysis for the sample film in the corpus,I am able to identify
the following three phenomena: 1) the length of the translated Chinese
subtitles is often longer than their equivalent in the original English
text: there are on average 2.69 more words in Chinese than in English;
2) about 60% of subtitles are translated by using different translation
strategies; 3) about 17% out of the aforementioned 60% of subtitles are
translated using traditional Chinese expressions,such as
idioms,archaisms as well as some modern expressions,such as popular
language in networks and new words.This syntagmatic patterning in texts
has shown that “the coselection of syntax and lexis often involves not
just one word but a series of them” (Francis 1993: 143).</p>
<p>Therefore,the questionnaire is designed as follows:In the first
section,I offer the respondents 15 paired-choice questions about
two-version translations marked as “A” and “B”.The related content is
taken from the sample film Despicable Me 1,with all the A choices taken
from the film’s public release and which the researcher has downloaded
from the official website of Sheshou.All the translations are regarded
as a better quality of translation with regard to certain translation
strategies.This relates to earlier discussion about the four translation
strategies from Gottlieb’s typology that are applicable to E-C
translation,known as transfer,transcription,paraphrase and
condensation.Moreover,two additional strategies known as globalization
and localization are also considered within the context of considering
the film as a form of commercial product.In the process of making films
for commercial purposes within international markets,globalization and
localization are interactional with each other (O’Hagan and Ashworth
2002: 66).Therefore,I have deliberately selected two or three subtitles
that deploy each strategy in order to observe whether the respondents’
preferences are the same as those of the translator of the sample
film,or not.Meanwhile,all the B choices are a literal or word-for-word
translation of the original text did by me.The method of translation in
the B choices generally uses a similar equivalence to the corresponding
original in order to achieve an optimal translation.Since the
respondents are undergraduates majoring in English,they should be
expected to have a higher level of competence in both the English
language and E-C translation ability.Therefore,the expected result of
this section is that most respondents should prefer A rather than B.</p>
<p>However,the respondents are also given the opportunity to state their
own translation at C,if they believe that they can provide a better
translation than the given two choices.Generally speaking,the purpose of
the first section in the questionnaire is to check whether the use of
strategies is acknowledged and actively considered as important in the
production of an optimal quality of subtitling,and E-C in
particular.</p>
<p>The function of the second section of the questionnaire is to help me
identify more specific and detailed information or evidence to further
validate the findings from the first section.Respondents are offered
five multiple choice questions.</p>
<p>For the first question,respondents are asked: “In the most recent
four years of your life at university,how often have you been to the
cinema to see cartoon films?” Based on the demographic make-up of
animation film audiences in the last five years,the researcher has
presumed that young people between the ages of 18 and 24 ought to form
the majority of the audience for this kind of film.The purpose of the
first question is to investigate whether this assumption is correct or
not.Moreover,confirmation of what makes up the majority of the audience
is intended to help me to qualify whether this group of respondents is
ideally suited to the current study.</p>
<p>The second question is: “Do you think the length of the
Chinesetranslated subtitles is readable?” The wording reflects the fact
that,in the corpus-based data analysis,the researcher expects to find
that the translated subtitles are always longer than the original
ones.That said,it should be considered that,under the mechanical
constraints of film screen lines,the subtitler has to bear in mind the
acceptable length of subtitles in each line.</p>
<p>Of course,Chinese characters are different from English because they
are hieroglyphic and,therefore,normally demand more reading time from
the audience than those reading alphabetic writing,such as
English.Hence,for translation from English into Chinese,the subtitler
needs to pay more attention to the expression of Chinese.Given the
practical limits inherent in this question,this is expected to elicit a
viewpoint on recently translated Chinese subtitles from the
respondents.If the response is mostly positive,it shows that the
released translation is good in terms of quality.If their response is
mostly negative,however,this suggests the need for a greater emphasis in
using translation strategies,such as condensation and substitution,in
the process of translating.</p>
<p>The next question is concerned with the expression of translated
subtitles from the perspective of linguistic peculiarities.The
participants are asked: “Do you prefer translations that make use of
traditional Chinese expressions such as idioms,proverbs,sentences from
ancient poems or archaisms?” In so doing,I provide examples within the
questionnaire in order to focus the respondents’ perspective on this
with consideration of the professional level attained by these
respondents.</p>
<p>If the participants believe that the use of typical Chinese
expressions helps make the film more attractive to them,this position
then becomes the precondition by which the researcher will develop
further suggestions for subtitling in the ensuing chapter.However,if the
answer to this question is generally negative or indecisive,further
research ought then to be conducted in order to establish whether an
emphasis on the use of particular Chinese forms of expression in
subtitling is necessary or not.</p>
<p>In the same vein,take the following question: “Do you like
translations that make use of modern Chinese expressions such as spoken
vernacular language made popular on the Internet?” With regard to spoken
Chinese,language scholars confirm topical linguistic expressions that
are used in common parlance on an annual basis.This is a mechanism by
which the masses become acquainted with the most topically authentic
communication between the Chinese people,especially amongst the younger
generations.Moreover,more and more middle-aged people and even senior
citizens choose to pay attention to this kind of contemporary language
and its expressions in order to better communicate with and understand
young people.</p>
<p>Therefore,the use of this type of language ought to be welcomed in
subtitling as well.If the selected group of respondents agree with this
opinion,further discussion concerning the application of this type of
expression in subtitling is necessitated and meaningful.Conversely,if
there is disagreement,other solutions ought to be tested.</p>
<p>The last question in the second section is: “Do you think the use of
traditional and modern Chinese expressions requires subtitlers’
awareness of cultural difference?” To this end,I again supply some
examples with a simple explanation of their corresponding cultural
points,the purpose of which is to calibrate how far the respondents
realize the function of these expressions and to invite them to share
their viewpoints on the importance of the contribution made by Chinese
cultural elements to subtitling.As the respondents are all English
language learners,they may have a certain awareness of the culture being
“translated” in the context of their education and reflexive
experience.That said,it is hoped that the questionnaire facilitates a
range of “authentic” responses that challenge any preconceptions or
assumptions particularly on the researcher’s part.</p>
<p>The last section of the questionnaire is an open-ended question: “In
your opinion,what have been the main problems and weaknesses that have
emerged in the subtitles of recently released cartoon films?” I include
a list of the names of her selected films with a print-out of 60 pairs
of bilingual subtitles from the sample film in order to help respondents
answer this question.Apart from the questions I ask them in the first
two sections of the questionnaire,it is expected that the respondents
will offer their own findings within the limitations of the animation
films.Their contribution should offer evidence relevant to my hypotheses
as well as prompt more thinking around the research topic.</p>
