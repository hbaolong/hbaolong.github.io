id="observations-and-suggestions-regarding-the-use-of-traditional-expressions">6.2.1　Observations
and Suggestions Regarding the Use of Traditional Expressions</h4>
<p>After collecting all the translated subtitles using traditional
expressions from the 15 selected films with the help of ParaConc,I
categorized the data in two ways: where using traditional expressions in
these data is demonstrably effective,and where using traditional
expressions is inappropriate by comparing with their original texts.</p>
<p>For the first category,as released translated products,the majority
of these 935 translated subtitles have a satisfactory level of
translation by using effective traditional expressions rather than
direct translation.The following examples are representative of using
effective traditional expressions in the corpus data.</p>
<p>By comparison with the literal translation (direct translation
method) (without using any other strategies),all of the released
translated subtitles in each of the 15 animated films clearly show the
benefits of using traditional expressions in this context:</p>
<p>① 7700:07:00,202 to00:07:05,382</p>
<p>I simply can’t stop thinking about the miserable beasts,every single
minute of every single day.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>我只是老想那些小东西，每时每刻都情不自禁。（Released
Translation）</p>
<p>I always think about those little things,every single minute of every
single day,I can’t stop thinking.(Back translation)</p>
<p>我忍不住总是想着那些可怜的小东西，每时每刻都在想着。（Direct
translation）</p>
<p>I just can’t stop thinking about those poor little things,every
single minute of every single day I am thinking.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(The Smurfs 1,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： 1） The length is 19 characters vs.24 characters.2）
“情不自禁” is an idiom，meaning it has a stronger resonance and is a
more literary expression in the Chinese language than
“忍不住总是”，although both of them mean “can’t help doing
something”.</p>
<p>② 00:14:27,872 to 00:14:32,616</p>
<p>I won’t be alone.I can’t wait to meet everyone.(Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>我再不会孤独，我迫不及待想见到大家。 （Released translation）</p>
<p>I won’t be alone.I can’t wait to meet everyone.(Back translation)</p>
<p>我不再感到孤独，我等不及要见到大家。 （Direct translation）</p>
<p>I won’t feel alone any longer.I can’t wait to see everyone.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>(Frozen,2013)</p>
<p>Observations： Although the two translations regarding this pair have
the same length，“迫不及待”is an idiom，which is both a written and more
formal expression than “等不及”.Moreover，because “迫” means “very much
or extremely want to do something”，this idiom more idiomatic than
“等不及”.</p>
<p>③ 00:23:21,132 to 00:23:23,629</p>
<p>Three of them pretended I was invisible.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>其中有三个当我是隐形人。（Released translation）</p>
<p>(Transfer: from an adjective into a noun)</p>
<p>Three of them pretended me as an invisible man.(Back translation)</p>
<p>他们中有三人当我是隐形的。 （Direct translation）</p>
<p>Three of them pretended I was an invisible man.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Frozen,2013)</p>
<p>Observations: In this pair,the subtitler changed the last word from
an adjective to a noun,while keeping the original meaning of the source
language.In Chinese,the noun form of this word is more common than its
adjective counterpart when used to describe a person.As this change is
more like an expression used in reallife situations,this will make the
audience feel it is closer to their everyday language.The research would
consider this change to be a manifestation of transfer,one of Gottlieb’s
suggested translation strategies in subtitling.</p>
<p>④ 00:03:04,711 to 00:03:07,441</p>
<p>No doubt you’ll be a clever Omega.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>毫无疑问你将是个聪明的Omega。 （Released translation）</p>
<p>No doubt you’ll be a clever Omega.(Back translation)</p>
<p>你一定会成为一个聪明的人，Omega。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>You will definitely be a clever man,Omega.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Alpha and Omega,2010)</p>
<p>Observations： The function of “no doubt” in the original sentence is
to strengthen the voice of the expression，such that it means “surely”
or “definitely”.The released translation used to translate this phrase
was “毫无疑问”，which is an equal transfer in between the two languages
because “毫无疑问” in Chinese means the same as “no doubt” in
English.However，the direct translation of “一定” means</p>
<p>“surely” or “definitely”,which is a correct translation,but is less
vivid in terms of a literal description.</p>
<p>⑤ 00:07:43,356 to 00:07:45,017</p>
<p>You can’t just snake it out from under us.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>你不能像那样冲出来打草惊蛇。（Released
translation）（transcription，condensation）</p>
<p>You can’t just rush out like that and sneak it from under us.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>你不能从我们眼皮底下抢走她。（Direct translation）You can’t pull her
out from under us.（Back translation）</p>
<p>(Alpha and Omega,2010)</p>
<p>Observations： The researcher assumed that the subtitler of this film
was inspired to use “打草惊蛇” for the original word “snake”.The direct
translation is actually more faithful to the original meaning of “sneak
it from under us”； however，“打草惊蛇” is also suitable in terms of
this language situation，given that the subtitler found an idiom that
not only has the same meaning as the word “snake”，but also matches the
meaning in the original phrase.This translation strategy is artfully
combined transcription and condensation.I think it should be encouraged
in today’s subtitling work because it can better reflect the subtitler’s
strong knowledge of the Chinese language and their competence in
transferring meanings between two languages.</p>
<p>⑥ 00:17:12,524 to 00:17:15,459</p>
<p>Wow.This is a new feeling.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>哇，一笑倾城啊。 （Released translation）（Substitute）</p>
<p>Wow.A single smile could overthrow a city.(The underlined translation
is the direct back translation of the above idiom)</p>
<p>(Back translation)</p>
<p>哇，这次感觉不一样啊。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Wow.This is a different feeling.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Alpha and Omega,2010)</p>
<p>Observations： In this original subtitle，“a new feeling” means “a
different feeling from the last time”.The subtitler uses the
substitution strategy to translate it into “一笑倾城”.This idiom
originally described an ancient beauty’s smile，which captivated an
entire city.The background story is similar to that about Helen of
Troy.Meanwhile，in current Chinese language，people can describe any
beautiful girl’s sweet and charming smile by using this idiom，except
when such a smile has some negative consequence.So，in this
translation，“一笑倾城” can be regarded as flattering because，despite
the lack of context，we can still understand the “new feeling” to be
positive in terms of its objective.</p>
<p>⑦ 00:17:22,001 to 00:17:25,801</p>
<p>When you yelled,“Hey”,I thought you cinched it right there.(Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>你说“你好”的时候我觉得你把握十足呢。（Released translation）</p>
<p>When you said “Hello”,I thought you were very confident of
success.(Back translation)</p>
<p>你喊着“嘿”的时候，我以为你对此是很有把握的。</p>
<p>(Direct translation)</p>
<p>When you yelled “Hey”,I supposed you were very sure about that.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>(Alpha and Omega,2010)</p>
<p>Observations： Except for the length preponderance，the characters
“十足” represent a more vivid description than “很有” in Chinese；
although，in English，both mean “very” or “fairly”.Moreover，when this
expression is read or spoken out loud，the expression “把握十足” is more
evocative.Sometimes，in order to give the subtitle a more impressive
literary effect，or to make the expression more indicative of the social
position of the character，the translation should be more focused on
eliciting this sort of awareness from the reader.In this subtitle，the
speaker uttered this sentence with a tone of ridicule，meaning that
“把握十足” is a better way of indicating this mode of expression.</p>
<p>⑧ 00:04:06,787 to 00:04:08,587</p>
<p>…we do this as a family.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>……像一家人那样齐心协力。（Released translation）（Addition）</p>
<p>…we do this as a family does shoulder to shoulder.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>……像一家人一样做事。 （Direct translation）</p>
<p>…we do this as a family.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(The Croods,2013)</p>
<p>Observations： In the released translation，“齐心协力” represents an
addition.The original English subtitle has no equivalence for this
word，but the indicative meaning of “to do this as a family” is
obvious： we should unite.“齐心协力” means “make a concerted effort” and
“shoulder to shoulder”.Moreover，this idiom can be explained as a
translation of the word “do”，the purpose of which is to make the
translated subtitle more detailed，yet easier to understand.</p>
<p>⑨ 00:11:08,170 to 00:11:09,970</p>
<p>Never not be afraid.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>(Although this is not correct English,in the film,the speaker is a
senior person,who is a conservative father,always afraid that his
children might get hurt in the outside world.As such,he keeps warning
them about the dangers of the outside world.Here,he changes the saying
“Never be afraid” into “Never NOT be afraid” in order to strengthen his
emphasis on the danger of the outside world to his children.)</p>
<p>千万不要什么都无所畏惧。（Released translation）</p>
<p>Never be too fearless.(Back translation)</p>
<p>永远不要不害怕。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Never be too fearless.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(The Croods,2013)</p>
<p>Observations： The original subtitle is a sentence starting with the
word “never”，which suggests that the speaker is offering a warning or
making an attempt at persuasion.Therefore，when translating this
sentence，an assertive word is needed.“千万不要” and “无所畏惧” are both
assertive words in Chinese.Although the released translation is hardly
any longer than the direct translation，the researcher agrees with the
released version in this case.That is to say，in translation work，we
should sometimes follow this rule： “choose the lesser of two
evils”.However，we still need to make sure that the length is within an
acceptable limit.</p>
<p>⑩ 00:02:19,280 to 00:02:21,860</p>
<p>…Stay focused,try to run my race.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>……全神贯注跑我的比赛。（Released translation）</p>
<p>…Stay focused,try to run my race.(Back translation)</p>
<p>……保持注意力集中，好好参加我的比赛。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>…Stay focused,try to run my race.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Turbo,2013)</p>
<p>Observations： The idiom “全神贯注” is concise and comprehensive in
terms of explaining “stay focused” in this context.The preference for
using an idiom，instead of a simple expression，is a recent
tendency，which has evolved in the last three years in the world of film
translation work.Based on the findings in her corpus，the researcher
observed that，as mentioned in Section 6.1.1，the use of idioms，rather
than straightforward explanations of the original subtitles，have
increased sharply in translated films since 2010.This suggests that
subtitlers are paying more attention to the way their work can
facilitate the reception of language and culture by film viewers.</p>
<p>01:01:35,300 to 01:01:39,900</p>
<p>I don’t like this book.This is going on forever.(Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>我讨厌这本书。没完没了的。（Released translation）</p>
<p>I hate this book.This is endless.(Back translation)</p>
<p>我不喜欢这本书。这书一直往下继续，看不到结尾。</p>
<p>(Direct translation)</p>
<p>I hate this book.This is going on forever,can’t see the ending.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>(Despicable Me 1,2010)</p>
<p>Observations： In the released translation，the subtitler uses the
idiom “没完没了” to explain the speaker’s second sentence in the
original subtitle.This is a wise decision，given that，in Chinese，this
idiom indicates an impatient attitude towards something or somebody.This
reflects the attitude of the speaker in the film as well： when he began
living with his adopted daughters，Gru lacked patience as a parent
because he was unable to settle down in his new role as a father.But his
inner heart is enduringly still kind，such that in the second instalment
of the film series，he is seen to be a better dad and even a real one
than in the first： he protects the oldest daughter when she wants to
accept the dance invitation from a boy； he sends his daughters back
home as soon as he realized the party is dangerous.Compared with the
released translation，the direct translation of this subtitle is more
like a narration； it cannot convey the indicated impatient attitude of
the speaker.</p>
<p>⑩00:38:05,617 to 00:38:09,077</p>
<p>Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken? (Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>谁会对可爱的小鸡下此狠手？（Released Translation）</p>
<p>Who would do such a ruthless thing to a cute little chicken like
this? (Back translation)</p>
<p>谁会对这样可爱的小鸡做这种事呢？（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken? (Back
translation)</p>
<p>(Despicable Me 2,2014)</p>
<p>Observations： Similar to the previous example，the traditional
expression“下此狠手” is a Chinese archaism，which refers to doing
ruthless things to somebody or something （in this case，a
chicken），such as bullying or inflicting punishment or
revenge.However，the direct translation cannot express the nature of
“such a thing”.Although the audience can understand it in relation to
the context of the film，the use of this archaism further emphasizes the
cruel nature of “such a thing”.</p>
<p>00:01:13,820 to 00:01:16,050</p>
<p>I’m faster than fast.Quicker than quick.(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>疾上加疾，快上加快。（Released Translation）</p>
<p>I’m faster than fast.Quicker than quick.(Back translation)</p>
<p>我会越来越快，越来越快的。 （Direct translation）</p>
<p>I’m faster than fast.Faster than fast.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Cars 1,2006)</p>
<p>Observations： The released translation is considered better than the
direct translation because of the use of “疾” and “快” in the given
archaism.These two characters are synonyms，both of them meaning “fast
and quick”.Given that the original dialogue refers to synonyms for
“fast” and “quick”，the use of “疾” and “快” is fully appropriate in the
translated subtitle.This is what the direct translation cannot
embody.</p>
<p>00:13:54,070 to 00:13:57,096</p>
<p>Big oil.It costs a fortune.Pollution is getting worse.(Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>石油巨头，很有钱。污染日趋严重了。（Released Translation）</p>
<p>Big oil.It costs a fortune.Pollution is getting worse.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>石油巨头。很大一笔钱。污染越来越严重。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Big oil.It costs a fortune.Pollution is getting worse.(Back
translation)</p>
<p>(Cars 2,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： The idiom in the released translation has the same
meaning as the pattern “越来越严重” in the direct
translation.However，with regard to the aesthetics of
translation，“日趋严重” is more idiomatic and somewhat shorter than
“越来越严重”.Generally speaking，in consideration of the mechanical
limits，if a traditional expression can shorten the length of the
translated subtitle，its use is recommended.</p>
<p>00:11:16,980 to 00:11:21,780</p>
<p>…you don’t know anything about life outside of the zoo?</p>
<p>(Original subtitle)</p>
<p>……对动物园外的世界一无所知？（Released translation）</p>
<p>…you don’t know anything about life outside of the zoo?</p>
<p>(Back translation)</p>
<p>……你对动物园以外的生活什么都不知道？（Direct translation）</p>
<p>…you don’t know anything about life outside of the zoo?</p>
<p>(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar 1,2005)</p>
<p>Observations： Again，using the idiom “一无所知” not only makes the
translation shorter than the direct translation，but also emphasizes the
speaker’s assertive tone of voice.The background setting for this
subtitle concerns the protagonist，Alex the lion，who is growing up in a
zoo； he has no idea about the world beyond the zoo，although he is
curious about it.He asks his friends whether they share his curiosity
and，if not，why do they not feel any regret.As such，the use of
“一无所知” can better emphasize the fact that Alex has a strong desire
to go outside，while this idiom also indicates he is going to be in
danger on the basis that he knows nothing about the world beyond the
zoo.From this point of view，the use of this idiom also has the function
of “sowing the seeds” of his future life and the challenges it will
entail.</p>
<p>00:17:38,770 to 00:17:41,720</p>
<p>You don’t bite the hand that feeds you.—I know that’s right.(Original
subtitle)</p>
<p>你不能恩将仇报。—那是对的。（Released translation）</p>
<p>You don’t bite the hand that feeds you / requite kindness with
enmity.—I know that’s right.(Back translation)</p>
<p>你不能咬曾经喂养你的双手/用敌意回报善意。—我知道那是对的。（Direct
translation）</p>
<p>You don’t bite the hand that feeds you/ requite kindness with
enmity.— I know that’s right.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar 1,2005)</p>
<p>Observations： In the Youdao English-Chinese dictionary
（http：//dict.youdao.com），the sayings “don’t bite the hands that feed
you” and “requite enmity with kindness” are said to share the same
meaning as “恩将仇报”.However，the direct translation is a word-for-word
translation of the English expressions.Although the meanings of the
direct translation are also easy to comprehend by the readers or
audiences，both “咬曾经喂养你的双手” and “用敌意回报善意” are equal in
length.</p>
<p>00:01:25,561 to 00:01:27,792</p>
<p>You just amuse yourself,don’t you? (Original subtitle)</p>
<p>你就是自娱自乐，是吧？（Released translation）</p>
<p>You just amuse yourself,don’t you? (Back translation)</p>
<p>你就是娱乐自己，是不是？（Direct translation）</p>
<p>You just amuse yourself,don’t you? (Back translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar 2,2009)</p>
<p>Observations： Although both the released translation and the direct
translation involve four characters to explain the original pattern of
“amuse yourself” （“自娱自乐” and “娱乐自己”），the idiom “自娱自乐” is
orderly in terms of structure.Moreover，according to Song （2012），the
use of idioms is a language custom found in Chinese people’s everyday
life； therefore，when there is an equivalent Chinese idiom to explain a
particular piece of original dialogue，this Chinese idiom should be used
as a priority.This is considered，in translation terms，as a way of
“killing two birds with one stone”： the shorter the length of the
idiom，the more easily understood it will be from the perspective of
cultural awareness.</p>

<p>又是一败涂地的一天。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Another day bites the dust.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Madagascar 3,2012)</p>
<p>Observations： According to the context，Alex is hoping to be taken
home by the penguins.However，when he hears that the penguins are not
coming yet，he feels disappointed，saying，“Another day bites the
dust”.In the released translation，the subtitler chooses to use
“大失所望” to explain Alex’s great disappointment.However，in the direct
translation，although “一败涂地” is a dictionary definition for “bites
the dust”，it cannot fully convey Alex’s sad and hopeless mood.That
said，“一败涂地” is more often used to describe “someone having fully
failed to do something”，as it emphasizes one’s actions rather than
desires.Thus，“大失所望” is much closer to the original expression.In
addition，the subtitler’s choice of using “大失所望”，rather than
“一败涂地”，indicates that they did think over their options and finally
chose the one that better reveals the speaker’s internal thoughts.</p>

<p>(Madagascar 3,2012)</p>
<p>Observations: In the previous section,according to the data
results,the researcher concluded that the subtitler for Madagascar 3
uses traditional expressions in 133 out of 1,293 translated
subtitles.This is the highest frequency in terms of using traditional
expressions among the 15 selected film translations.When investigating
this specific film,I found that these 133 translated subtitles generally
use appropriate traditional expressions to make the overall translation
of the film more funny and interesting.These two examples are
representatives of this translation method.</p>
<p>These two subtitles appear successively in the film when Marty
（Alex’s friend，the zebra） looks at the King of Versailles and is
greatly shocked by the king’s flamboyant attire.The two released
translations here use not only a Chinese archaism and an idiom （in
bold），but the tone of voice and the sentence patterns，which are
underlined，reflect the way in which popular expressions are used in
Chinese.On the one hand，“惊天地泣鬼神” is an archaism，whose original
meaning is “someone’s behaviour moved the whole universe”，which is
often used to describe a great dedication or devotion to something
meaningful，while “面目全非” means “looks being ruined out of all
recognition”.However，in today’s Chinese language，when people describe
something or somebody good or bad to an unbelievable degree，they may
choose these two expressions to explain their point of views with
exaggeration.This is a humorous way to say someone is ugly to the extent
of “惊天地泣鬼神” or “面目全非”.In addition，in the second
example，“最最” and “……掌” are two other popular expressions used in the
released translation.In Chinese colloquial language，the times of
repeatedly used “最” show the varied degrees of the described thing or
person.The more the “最”，the greater the extent is.In modern
Chinese，there are commonly three ways in which to use “最”，meaning
“very”： “最最” and “最最最” respectively meaning “very，very” and
“very，very，very”.Similarly，in informal English，these three ways of
using “very” also exist； therefore，“最最” is also appropriate for this
specific translation in which the king’s extravagant appearance is being
described.Another expression，“面目全非掌”，is one created by the
subtitler.In Chinese，“……掌” originally referred to a kind of Chinese
martial arts，which the Wushu masters learned in order to defeat
opponents.The subtitler combines the idiom “面目全非” with “……掌” in
order to emphasize the fact that the king’s dress sense is
unappealing.In popular expression，the antonym of “面目全非掌” is
“还我漂漂拳”，which appears in a very famous comedy，Flirting Scholar
（1993），made by Stephen Chow，a well-known Hong Kong film
director.“还我漂漂拳” means “a box that can make the receiver get back
her beautiful face”.Coincidently，“拳” is another kind of Chinese
martial arts gesture； therefore，I suppose that the subtitler of this
film might have taken their inspiration from Stephen Chow.Using this
familiar expression，then，may make the Chinese audience for Madagascar
3 feel more engaged with this foreign film.</p>

<p>And that lecture about “saving the blue parrots.” (Back

<p>还有整套的“拯救物种”的说辞。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>And those remarks about “saving the species”.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(Rio 1,2011)</p>
<p>Observations： The background information to this subtitle concerns
the fact that the ornithologist Tulio convinced Linda，the owner of a
blue parrot，to bring her bird Blu to meet another blue
parrot，Jewel，in order to continue and save this rare species of
parrot.However，these two parrots were stolen by a gang of
smugglers.Therefore，Linda complains that Tulio’s concern about “saving
the species” has now put her bird in danger.In the released
translation，“长篇大论” may indicate that Tulio has gone to great
lengths to convince Linda to make the decision he wants her
to.However，although the direct translation explains the original
subtitle，it does not properly convey Linda’s complaining response as
vividly as the released translation with the idiom “长篇大论”.</p>

<p>没有你的表演，它什么都不是。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>Without your performance,it’s nothing.</p>
<p>(Rio 2,2014)</p>
<p>Observations： In the released translation，the use of traditional
expression involves the idiom “一文不值”，which originally comes from
the archaism “最可悲年少科名，弄得一文不值”，meaning “the most
regrettable thing is that having passed the imperial examination in your
youth is worthless now”.In modern Chinese，“一文不值” is still used to
describe something that has become worthless because of some contrived
reason.In this subtitle，the use of this idiom is to emphasize “your
performance” as being more important than the play or the producer of
this play （Shakespeare）.In the film context，this represents a kind of
acceptance and compliment between friends.Compared with the released
translation，the direct translation is acceptable； however，regarding
the tone of voice，the use of the idiom “一文不值” is stronger，as it
expresses a higher level of compliment from the speaker to the
receiver.</p>

<p>用爱和善良，一次全面的大转变。（Direct translation）</p>
<p>With love and kindness,a complete makeover.(Back translation)</p>
<p>(The Smurfs 2,2013)</p>
<p>Observations： According to the context，this subtitle is describing
a significant change of a particular smurfette.She was originally
created by the bad wizard and sent to the smurfs in order to ruin their
life and capture them all for the wizard.However，the smurfs’ father
discovered her kind side and helped her to change into a real smurf，who
has love and kindness for others.The subtitler’s use of “洗心革面” is
better than the direct translation of “makeover” because “洗心革面”
refers to “someone who changes from being evil to an angel”.The literal
meaning of this idiom is “to cleanse the heart and reform the
image”.However，“大转变” is only able to explain someone or something
that is greatly changed，without being specific about the nature of the
change （e.g.，good to bad，bad to good，colour，size and form）.</p>

translation)</p>
<p>当年没人认识，现在来得势不可挡。（Direct translation） after being
unintentionally discovered in New York.（Back translation）</p>
<p>(The Smurfs 2,2013)</p>
<p>Observations： This is a longer subtitle than the average length of
subtitles in general.Therefore，the original subtitle is divided into
two lines.Given the inverse sentence orders in English and Chinese，the
original subtitle pairs appear staggered and dissymmetric.This is
clearer when observing the original dialogue in one line： “This
mysterious master has gone from unknown to unstoppable after a surprise
discovery in New York”.Its released translation is
“自从在纽约意外被发现后，这位神秘的大师一炮而红，当年名不见经传的他如今已名声大振。”，in
which the subtitler uses three traditional expressions in order to make
the translation more vivid and make the tone of voice more
assertive.“一炮而红” is an idiom that refers to somebody or something
that has become well-known or popular in a very short time.This idiom
comes from an ancient custom，when people referred to the success
following the debut of an actor at the Chinese opera as
“一炮而红”.Additionally，“炮” refers to “firecrackers”，which，again in
ancient times，were regarded as a symbol of good luck and prosperity；
therefore，“一炮而红” means becoming famous after one
performance”.“名不见经传” is an archaism meaning an “unknown but
mysterious person or thing”，while “名声大振” is another idiom meaning
“rise to fame”.Besides，the direct translation is：
“自从在纽约意外被发现后，这位神秘的大师一夜蹿红，当年没人认识，现在来得势不可挡。”
In this translation，one traditional expression and one popular
expression are used.“一夜蹿红” and “一炮而红” share a similar
meaning.However，unlike “一炮而红”，“一夜蹿红” is not an idiom，but a
popular expression found in modern Chinese，which mean “someone who
becomes a star overnight”.Although this expression may also explain the
original subtitle，it places more emphasis on the speed （“very short
time”），unlike “一炮而红”，which places more emphasis on the process of
becoming famous.According to the context of the film，“一炮而红” is more
relevant to the speaker’s point of view than “一夜蹿红”.The other
expression references — “势不可挡”，which is a traditional idiom meaning
“unstoppable”.Therefore，it can be regarded as an acceptable translation
of the original expression.</p>
<p>To sum up,from the above given examples,it is clear that the use of
traditional expressions in the data has generally three main
advantages:</p>
<p>Firstly,the length of the translated subtitles involving traditional
expressions is shorter than the ones without such expressions.This is an
applicable method in subtitle translation from the perspective of
mechanical limits in space and time.According to the data,Chinese idioms
are the most frequently used types of traditional expression.Given the
feature of word formation,the use of Chinese idioms generally condenses
the expected length of the translated subtitles; therefore,using them
within E-C subtitle translation can make the length of the translated
subtitles more readable.</p>
<p>Secondly,direct translation always delivers the original meaning in a
literal sense; however,the function of the use of traditional
expressions can make the translated subtitles look more literary and
evocative.The use of traditional expressions in subtitle translations is
considered as an “audience-centred” method because it involves
translations that are closer to the real-life language that is familiar
to the target audience.</p>
<p>Thirdly,from the perspective of cultural awareness,the use of
traditional expressions in E-C subtitle translation is unquestionably a
way to “shorten the distance” between the film and the target
audience.This is also a way to make the translation localized in order
to ensure that the intercultural communication between the film and the
audience is successful.</p>
<p>However,how difficult is it to use traditional expressions in the
process of translating? This requires the subtitlers’ practical
experience and high-level language and cultural knowledge to lay the
foundation.Any excessive or inadequate use of traditional expressions
will make the overall quality of subtitle translation imperfect.</p>
