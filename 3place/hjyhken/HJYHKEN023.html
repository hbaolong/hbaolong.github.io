<h4 id="appendix-a.-notes">Appendix A. Notes</h4>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Alberti, Leon Battista, The Use and Abuse of Books, translated by
Renée Watkins, Waveland Press, 1999.</p>
<p>So how do you fix schools? The key to the answer may be college. When
you go to (a good) college, most of the problems I describe get fixed.
So the solution may come from asking, how do you make life for teenage
nerds more like college life?</p>
<p>Home-schooling offers an immediate solution, but it probably isn’t
the optimal one. Why don’t parents home-school their kids all the way
through college? Because college offers opportunities home-schooling
can’t duplicate? So could high school if it were done right.</p>
<p>Chapter 2</p>
<p>Johnson wrote in the preface to his Shakespeare:</p>
<p>“He has long outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the
test of literary merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from
personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many
years been lost; and every topick of merriment or motive of sorrow,
which the modes of artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the
scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and
competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships and his
enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor
supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor
gratify malignity, but are read without any other reason than the desire
of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as pleasure is
obtained….“</p>
<p>The worst thing photography did to painting may have been to kill the
best day job. Most of the great painters in history supported themselves
by painting portraits. Soon after the invention of photography they were
undercut by hacks who worked from photographs. (This method is also
easier on the sitter.) The class of technically skilled painters then
more or less disappeared, and the role of skill in the price of painting
was superseded by brand (which also depends greatly on photography, or,
more precisely, on photographs reproduced in books and magazines).</p>
<p>Microsoft discourages employees from contributing to open source
projects, even in their spare time. But so many of the best hackers work
on open source projects now that the main effect of this policy may be
to make it hard for them to hire first-rate programmers.</p>
<p>What you learn about programming in college is like what you learn
about books or clothes: what bad taste you had in high school.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of applied empathy. At Viaweb, if we couldn’t
decide between two alternatives, we’d ask, what would our competitors
hate most? At one point a competitor added a feature to their software
that was basically useless, but since it was one of few they had that we
didn’t, they made much of it in the trade press. We could have tried to
explain that the feature was useless, but we decided it would annoy our
competitor more if we just implemented it ourselves, so we hacked
together our own version that afternoon.</p>
<p>Except text editors and compilers. Hackers don’t need empathy to
design these, because they are themselves typical users.</p>
<p>Well, almost. They overshot the available RAM somewhat, causing much
disk swapping, but this could be fixed by buying an additional disk
drive.</p>
<p>Abelson, Harold, and Gerald Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs, MIT Press, 1985.</p>
<p>The way to make programs easy to read is not to stuff them with
comments. I would take Abelson and Sussman’s rule a step further.
Programming languages should be designed to express algorithms, and only
incidentally to tell computers how to execute them. A good programming
language ought to be better for explaining software than English. You
should only need comments when there is some kind of kludge you need to
warn readers about, just as on a road there are only arrows on parts
with unexpectedly sharp curves.</p>
<p>Chapter 3</p>
<p>The Inquisition probably never intended to carry out their threat of
torture. But that was because Galileo made it clear he would do whatever
they asked. If he had refused, they would not simply have backed down.
Not long before they had burnt the philosopher Giordano Bruno when he
proved intransigent.</p>
<p>Many organizations obligingly publish lists of what you can’t say
within them. Unfortunately these lists are usually both incomplete,
because there are things so shocking they don’t even anticipate anyone
saying them, and at the same time so general that they couldn’t possibly
be enforced literally. It’s a rare university speech code that would
not, taken literally, forbid Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Kundel, H. L., C. F. Nodine, and E. A. Krupinski, “Searching for lung
nodules: Visual dwell indicates locations of false-positive and
false-negative decisions,“ Investigative Radiology, 24 (1989),
472-478.</p>
<p>The verb “diff “ is computer jargon, but it’s the only word with
exactly the sense I want. See Glossary.</p>
<p>It may seem from this that I am some kind of moral relativist. Far
from it. I think that “judgmental“ is one of the labels used in our time
to suppress discussion, and that our attempts to be “non-judgmental“
will seem to future eras one of the most comical things about us.</p>
<p>This makes the world confusing to kids, since what they see disagrees
with what they’re told. I could never understand why, for example,
Portuguese “explorers“ had started to work their way along the coast of
Africa. In fact, they were after slaves.</p>
<p>De Azurara, Gomes Eannes, Chronicle of the Discovery of Guinea, in
Almeida (ed.), Conquests and Discoveries of Henry the Navigator, George
Allen andandandand Unwin, 1936.</p>
<p>The kids soon learn these words from their friends, but they know
they’re not supposed to use them. So for a while you have a state of
affairs like something from a musical comedy, where the parents use
these words among their peers, but never in front of the children, and
the children use the words among their peers, but never in front of
their parents.</p>
<p>Viaweb’s logo was a solid red circle with a white V in the middle.
After we’d been using it for a while, I remember thinking, you know,
this is a really powerful symbol, a red circle. Red is arguably the most
basic color, and the circle the most basic shape. Together they had such
visual punch. Why didn’t more American companies have a red circle as
their logo? Ahh, yes….</p>
<p>The fear is far the stronger of the two forces. Sometimes when I hear
someone use the word “gyp“ I tell them, with a serious expression, that
one can’t use that word anymore because it’s considered disparaging to
Romani (aka Gypsies). In fact dictionaries disagree about its etymology.
But the reaction to this joke is nearly always one of slightly terrified
compliance. There is something about fashion, in clothing or ideas, that
takes away people’s confidence: when they learn something new, they feel
it was something they should have known already.</p>
<p>This is the one overt example in this essay of something you can’t
say. It violates the principal taboo of university life. Within
universities it’s an unspoken axiom that all areas of study are
intellectually equal. No doubt this axiom helps things run more
smoothly. But when you consider what an astonishing coincidence it would
require for it to be true, and how convenient it would be for everyone
to treat it as true even if it weren’t, how can you not question it?</p>
<p>Particularly when you consider some of the corollaries it forces you
to accept. For example, it would mean that there could not be ups and
downs within an individual field. Unless all fields were oscillating in
sync. (You really have to stretch to save this one.)</p>
<p>And then, what do you do about universities that have departments
like Culinary Arts or Sports Management? If you accept this axiom, how
far does it extend? Do you really want to find yourself defending the
position that differential geometry is no harder than cooking?</p>
<p>Presumably, within the industry, such thoughts would be considered
“negative.“ Another label, much like “defeatist.“ Never mind that, one
should ask, are they true or not? Indeed, the measure of a healthy
organization is probably the degree to which negative thoughts are
allowed. In places where great work is being done, the attitude usually
seems to be critical and sarcastic rather than “positive“ and
“supportive.“ The people I know who do great work think that they suck,
but that everyone else sucks more.</p>

1991.</p>
<p>Healy, Patrick, “Summers hits ‘anti-Semitic’ actions,“ Boston Globe,
20 September 2002.</p>
<p>“Tinkerers’ champion,“ The Economist, 20 June 2002.</p>
<p>By this I mean you’d have to become a professional controversialist,
not that Noam Chomsky’s opinions = what you can’t say. If you actually
said the things you can’t say, you’d shock conservatives and liberals
about equally—just as, if you went back to Victorian England in a time
machine, your ideas would shock Whigs and Tories about equally.</p>

2003.</p>

2000.</p>
<p>Some tribes avoid “wrong“ as judgmental, and instead use more
neutral-sounding euphemisms like “negative“ or “destructive.“</p>
<p>Chapter 4</p>
<p>I planned to learn how to pick locks too. But not just out of
intellectual curiosity. When I was about halfway through grad school,
the clever but truculent corps of undergrad hackers who used to
administer all the computers were replaced by a professional system
administrator who used to go home at 5 o’clock and leave the machine
room door locked. If a computer got wedged, one was expected to wait
till morning to reboot it. A completely impractical plan, since at that
time we often didn’t even start working till 5 PM. Fortunately, in Aiken
Lab (since demolished) there was a gap between the floors, and a
trapdoor right over the system administrator’s office. When we needed
the machine room key, we’d drop in through the ceiling and get it out of
his desk drawer.</p>
<p>One night at about 3 AM as I was climbing down onto the sysadmin’s
desk, earsplitting alarms went off all through the building. “Fuck,“ I
thought (sorry for the profanity, but I clearly remember thinking that),
“they’ve wired the place.“ I was out of that building in about thirty
seconds. I scurried home (through a drenching rainstorm), trying to look
nonchalant, but to my guilty conscience every car looked like a Crown
Victoria. When I showed up at the Lab the next day I was already
rehearsing my defense, but there was no ominous email waiting for me. It
turned out the alarms had been set off by lightning during the
storm.</p>
<p>It’s not just the content of products that’s increasingly software.
As manufacturing becomes more automated, designs become software
too.</p>
<p>I would gladly volunteer my name for this curve. Calling it something
will make the idea stick better.</p>
<p>Chapter 5</p>
<p>Realizing that much of the money is in the services, companies
building lightweight clients have usually tried to combine the hardware
with an online service. This approach has not worked well, partly
because you need two different kinds of companies to build consumer
electronics and to run an online service, and partly because users hate
the idea. Giving away the handle and making money on the blades may work
for Gillette, but a razor is a smaller commitment than a web
terminal.</p>
<p>Cell phone handset makers are satisfied to sell hardware without
trying to capture the service revenue as well. That should probably be
the model for Internet clients too. If someone just sold a nice-looking
little box with a web browser that you could use to connect through any
ISP, every technophobe in the country would buy one.</p>
<p>Security always depends more on not screwing up than any design
decision, but the nature of server-based software will make developers
pay more attention to not screwing up. Compromising a server could cause
such damage that ASPs (who want to stay in business) are likely to be
careful about security.</p>
<p>In 1995, when we started Viaweb, Java applets were supposed to be the
technology everyone was going to use to develop server-based
applications. Applets seemed to us an old-fashioned idea. Download
programs to run on the client? Simpler just to go all the way and run
the programs on the server. We wasted little time on applets, but
countless other startups must have been lured into this tar pit. Few
seem to have escaped alive.</p>
<p>This point is due to Trevor Blackwell, who adds, “The cost of writing
software goes up more than linearly with its size. Perhaps this is
mainly due to fixing old bugs, and the cost can be more linear if all
bugs are found quickly.“</p>
<p>The hardest kind of bug to find may be a variant of compound bug
where one bug happens to compensate for another. When you fix one bug,
the other becomes visible. But it will seem as if the fix is at fault,
since that was the last thing you changed.</p>
<p>Within Viaweb we once had a contest to describe the worst thing about
our software. Two customer support people tied for first prize with
entries I still shiver to recall. We fixed both problems
immediately.</p>
<p>Robert Morris wrote the ordering system, which shoppers used to place
orders. Trevor Blackwell wrote the image generator and the manager,
which merchants used to retrieve orders, view statistics, configure
domain names, etc. I wrote the editor, which merchants used to build
their sites. The ordering system and image generator were written in C
and C++, the manager mostly in Perl, and the editor in Common Lisp.</p>
<p>I’m using “exponentially“ in the colloquial sense here. Properly it
should be “polynomially.“</p>
<p>Price discrimination is so pervasive that I was surprised to find it
was outlawed in the US by the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936. This law does
not appear to be vigorously enforced.</p>
<p>In No Logo, Naomi Klein says that clothing brands favored by “urban
youth“ do not try too hard to prevent shoplifting because in their
target market the shoplifters are also the fashion leaders.</p>
<p>Companies often wonder what to outsource and what not to. One
possible answer: outsource any job that’s not directly exposed to
competitive pressure, because outsourcing it will thereby expose it to
competitive pressure. (I mean “outsource“ in the sense of hiring another
company to do it, not the more specific sense of hiring an overseas
company.)</p>
<p>The two guys were Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston. Dan wrote a
prototype in Basic in a couple days, then over the course of the next
year they worked together (mostly at night) to make a more powerful
version written in 6502 machine language. Dan was at Harvard Business
School at the time and Bob nominally had a day job writing software.
“There was no great risk in doing a business,“ Bob told me. “If it
failed it failed. No big deal.“</p>
<p>It’s not quite as easy as I make it sound. It took a long time for
word of mouth to get going, and we didn’t get a lot of press coverage
until we hired Schwartz Communications, probably the best high-tech PR
firm in the business, for 6,000/month (plus some warrants). However, it
was true that the only significant channel was our own web site.</p>
<p>If the Mac was so great, why did it lose? Cost, again. Microsoft
concentrated on the software business and unleashed a swarm of cheap
component suppliers on Apple hardware. It did not help, either, that
suits took over during a critical period. (And it hasn’t lost yet. If
Apple were to grow the iPod into a cell phone with a web browser,
Microsoft would be in big trouble.)</p>
<p>One thing that would help web-based applications, and help keep the
next generation of software from being overshadowed by Microsoft, would
be a good open source browser. A small, fast browser would be a great
thing in itself, and would encourage companies to build little web
appliances.</p>
<p>Best of all, a good open source browser could cause HTTP and HTML to
continue to evolve (as e.g. Perl has). Remember when every release of
Netscape added new features to HTML? Why did that have to stop?</p>
<p>It would help web-based applications greatly to be able to
distinguish between selecting a link and following it; all you’d need to
do this would be a trivial enhancement of HTTP, to allow multiple URLs
in a request. Cascading menus would also be good.</p>
<p>If you want to change the world, write a new Mosaic. Think it’s too
late? In 1998 a lot of people thought it was too late to launch a new
search engine, but Google proved them wrong. There is always room for
something new if it is significantly better.</p>
<p>Trevor Blackwell, who probably knows more about this from personal
experience than anyone, writes:</p>
<p>“I would go farther in saying that because server-based software is
so hard on the programmers, it causes a fundamental economic shift away
from large companies. It requires the kind of intensity and dedication
from programmers that they will only be willing to provide when it’s
their own company. Software companies can hire skilled people to work in
a not-too-demanding environment, and can hire unskilled people to endure
hardships, but they can’t hire highly skilled people to bust their
asses. Since capital is no longer needed, big companies have little to
bring to the table.“</p>
<p>I would not even use Javascript, if I were you; Viaweb didn’t. Most
of the Javascript I see on the Web isn’t necessary, and much of it
breaks. And when you start to be able to browse actual web pages on your
cell phone or PDA (or toaster), who knows if they’ll even support
it?</p>
<p>Chapter 6</p>
<p>One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is
uninterruptability. Different kinds of work have different time quanta.
Someone proofreading a manuscript could probably be interrupted every
fifteen minutes with little loss of productivity. But the time quantum
for hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load a problem
into your head. So the cost of having someone from personnel call you
about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.</p>
<p>This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they turn from
their screen to answer your question. Inside their heads a giant house
of cards is tottering.</p>
<p>The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers from
starting hard projects. This is why they tend to work late at night, and
why it’s next to impossible to write great software in a cubicle (except
late at night).</p>
<p>One great advantage of startups is that they don’t yet have any of
the people who interrupt you. There is no personnel department, and thus
no form nor anyone to call you about it.</p>
<p>Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be 20 or
30 times as productive as those working for large companies, executives
at large companies will naturally wonder, how could I get the people
working for me to do that? The answer is simple: pay them to.</p>
<p>Internally most companies are run like Communist states. If you
believe in free markets, why not turn your company into one?</p>
<p>Hypothesis: A company will be maximally profitable when each employee
is paid in proportion to the wealth they generate.</p>
<p>Until recently even governments sometimes didn’t grasp the
distinction between money and wealth. Adam Smith (Wealth of Nations,
v:i) mentions several that tried to preserve their “wealth“ by
forbidding the export of gold or silver. But having more of the medium
of exchange would not make a country richer; if you have more money
chasing the same amount of material wealth, the only result is higher
prices.</p>
<p>There are many senses of the word “wealth,“ not all of them material.
I’m not trying to make a deep philosophical point here about which is
the true kind. I’m writing about one specific, rather technical sense of
the word “wealth.“ What people will give you money for. This is an
interesting sort of wealth to study, because it is the kind that
prevents you from starving. And what people will give you money for
depends on them, not you.</p>
<p>When you’re starting a business, it’s easy to slide into thinking
that customers want what you do. During the Internet Bubble I talked to
a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was starting an “outdoor
portal.“ You know what kind of business you should start if you like the
outdoors? One to recover data from crashed hard disks.</p>
<p>What’s the connection? None at all. Which is precisely my point. If
you want to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not
starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any plan that
centers on things you like doing.</p>
<p>That is where your idea of what’s valuable is least likely to
coincide with other people’s.</p>
<p>In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone else
microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to the
environment. While environmental costs should be taken into account,
they don’t make wealth a zero-sum game. For example, if you repair a
machine that’s broken because a part has come unscrewed, you create
wealth with no environmental cost.</p>
<p>Many people feel confused and depressed in their early twenties. Life
seemed so much more fun in college. Well, of course it was. Don’t be
fooled by the surface similarities. You’ve gone from guest to servant.
It’s possible to have fun in this new world. Among other things, you now
get to go behind the doors that say “authorized personnel only.“ But the
change is a shock at first, and all the worse if you’re not consciously
aware of it.</p>
<p>When VCs asked us how long it would take another startup to duplicate
our software, we used to reply that they probably wouldn’t be able to at
all. I think this made us seem naive, or liars.</p>
<p>Few technologies have one clear inventor. So as a rule, if you know
the “inventor“ of something (the telephone, the assembly line, the
airplane, the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their company
made money from it, and the company’s PR people worked hard to spread
the story. If you don’t know who invented something (the automobile, the
television, the computer, the jet engine, the laser), it’s because other
companies made all the money.</p>
<p>This is a good plan for life in general. If you have two choices,
choose the harder. If you’re trying to decide whether to go out running
or sit home and watch TV, go running. Probably the reason this trick
works so well is that when you have two choices and one is harder, the
only reason you’re even considering the other is laziness. You know in
the back of your mind what’s the right thing to do, and this trick
merely forces you to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>It is probably no accident that the middle class first appeared in
northern Italy and the low countries, where there were no strong central
governments. These two regions were the richest of their time and became
the twin centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated. If they
no longer play that role, it is because other places, like the United
States, have been truer to the principles they discovered.</p>
<p>It may indeed be a sufficient condition. But if so, why didn’t the
Industrial Revolution happen earlier? Two possible (and not
incompatible) answers: (a) It did. The Industrial Revolution was one in
a series. (b) Because in medieval towns, monopolies and guild
regulations initially slowed the development of new means of
production.</p>
<p>Chapter 7</p>
<p>Part of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some of
those most vocal on the subject of wealth—university students, heirs,
professors, politicians, and journalists—have the least experience
creating it. (This phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has
overheard conversations about sports in a bar.)</p>
<p>Students are mostly still on the parental dole, and have not stopped
to think about where that money comes from. Heirs will be on the
parental dole for life. Professors and politicians live within socialist
eddies of the economy, at one remove from the creation of wealth, and
are paid a flat rate regardless of how hard they work. And journalists
as part of their professional code segregate themselves from the
revenue-collecting half of the businesses they work for (the ad sales
department). Many of these people never come face to face with the fact
that the money they receive represents wealth—wealth that, except in the
case of journalists, someone else created earlier. They live in a world
in which income is doled out by a central authority according to some
abstract notion of fairness (or randomly, in the case of heirs), rather
than given by other people in return for something they wanted, so it
may seem to them unfair that things don’t work the same in the rest of
the economy.</p>
<p>(Some professors do create a great deal of wealth for society. But
the money they’re paid isn’t a quid pro quo. It’s more in the nature of
an investment.)</p>
<p>When one reads about the origins of the Fabian Society, it sounds
like something cooked up by the high-minded Edwardian child-heroes of
Edith Nesbit’s The Wouldbegoods.</p>
<p>According to a study by the Corporate Library, the median total
compensation, including salary, bonus, stock grants, and the exercise of
stock options, of SandandandandP 500 CEOs in 2002 was .65 million.
According to Sports Illustrated, the average NBA player’s salary during
the 2002-03 season was .54 million, and the Average major league
baseball player’s salary at the start of the 2003 season was .56
million. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the mean annual
wage in the US in 2002 was 5,560.</p>
<p>In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems to
have been about 2,000 sestertii (e.g. Horace, Sat. ii.7.43). A servant
girl cost 600 (Martial vi.66), while Columella (iii.3.8) says that a
skilled vine-dresser was worth 8,000. A doctor, P. Decimus Eros Merula,
paid 50,000 sestertii for his freedom ( Dessau, Inscriptiones 7812).
Seneca (Ep. xxvii.7) reports that one Calvisius Sabinus paid 100,000
sestertii apiece for slaves learned in the Greek classics. Pliny (Hist.
Nat. vii.39) says that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time
was 700,000 sestertii, for the linguist (and presumably teacher)
Daphnis, but that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their
own freedom.</p>
<p>Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices. An ordinary
laborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae. Xenophon (Mem. ii.5)
mentions prices ranging from 50 to 6,000 drachmae (for the manager of a
silver mine).</p>

<p>Eratosthenes (276-195 BC) used shadow lengths in different cities to
estimate the Earth’s circumference. He was off by only about 2%.</p>
<p>No, and Windows, respectively.</p>
<p>One of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and reality is
the valuation of hard work. In the Daddy Model, hard work is in itself
deserving. In reality, wealth is measured by what one delivers, not how
much effort it costs. If I paint someone’s house, the owner shouldn’t
pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush.</p>
<p>It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy Model
that it is unfair when someone works hard and doesn’t get paid much. To
help clarify the matter, get rid of everyone else and put our worker on
a desert island, hunting and gathering fruit. If he’s bad at it he’ll
work very hard and not end up with much food. Is this unfair? Who is
being unfair to him?</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the tenacity of the Daddy Model may be the
dual meaning of “distribution.“ When economists talk about “distribution
of income,“ they mean statistical distribution. But when you use the
phrase frequently, you can’t help associating it with the other sense of
the word (as in e.g. “distribution of alms“), and thereby subconsciously
seeing wealth as something that flows from some central tap. The word
“regressive“ as applied to tax rates has a similar effect, at least on
me; how can anything regressive be good?</p>
<p>“From the beginning of the reign Thomas Lord Roos was an assiduous
courtier of the young Henry VIII and was soon to reap the rewards. In
1525 he was made a Knight of the Garter and given the Earldom of
Rutland. In the thirties his support of the breach with Rome, his zeal
in crushing the Pilgrimage of Grace, and his readiness to vote the
death-penalty in the succession of spectacular treason trials that
punctuated Henry’s erratic matrimonial progress made him an obvious
candidate for grants of monastic property.“</p>

<p>William Cecil and his son Robert were each in turn the most powerful
minister of the crown, and both used their position to amass fortunes
among the largest of their times. Robert in particular took bribery to
the point of treason. “As Secretary of State and the leading advisor to
King James on foreign policy, [he] was a special recipient of favour,
being offered large bribes by the Dutch not to make peace with Spain,
and large bribes by Spain to make peace.“ (Stone, op. cit., p. 17.)</p>
<p>Though Balzac made a lot of money from writing, he was notoriously
improvident and was troubled by debts all his life.</p>
<p>A Timex will gain or lose about .5 seconds per day. The most accurate
mechanical watch, the Patek Philippe 10 Day Tourbillon, is rated at -1.5
to +2 seconds. Its retail price is about 20,000.</p>
<p>If asked to choose which was more expensive, a well-preserved 1989
Lincoln Town Car ten-passenger limousine (,000) or a 2004 Mercedes S600
sedan (22,000), the average Edwardian might well guess wrong.</p>
<p>To say anything meaningful about income trends, you have to talk
about real income, or income as measured in what it can buy. But the
usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the growth in
wealth over time, because it depends on a consumer price index created
by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are only locally
accurate, and that don’t include the prices of new inventions until they
become so common that their prices stabilize.</p>
<p>So while we might think it was very much better to live in a world
with antibiotics or air travel or an electric power grid than without,
real income statistics calculated in the usual way will prove to us that
we are only slightly richer for having these things.</p>
<p>Another approach would be to ask, if you were going back to the year
x in a time machine, how much would you have to spend on trade goods to
make your fortune? For example, if you were going back to 1970 it would
certainly be less than 00, because the processing power you can get for
00 today would have been worth at least 50 million in 1970. The function
goes asymptotic fairly quickly, because for times over a hundred years
or so you could get all you needed in present-day trash. In 1800 an
empty plastic drink bottle with a screw top would have seemed a miracle
of workmanship.</p>
<p>Some will say this amounts to the same thing, because the rich have
better opportunities for education. That’s a valid point. It is still
possible, to a degree, to buy your kids’ way into top colleges by
sending them to private schools that in effect hack the college
admissions process.</p>
<p>According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education
Statistics, about 1.7% of American kids attend private, non-sectarian
schools. At Princeton, 36% of the class of 2007 came from such schools.
(Interestingly, the number At Harvard is significantly lower, about
28%.) Obviously this is a huge loophole. It does at least seem to be
closing, not widening.</p>
<p>Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson
from the example of computer security, and instead of just assuming that
their system can’t be hacked, measure the degree to which it is.</p>
<p>Chapter 8</p>
<p>Some of the essays in this book have been rewritten, but except for
translating the probability calculations from Lisp code into
mathematical notation, I left this one alone. So a few things in it are
no longer true. Few spams contain the word “click“ now. But the
algorithm still works. A slightly improved version catches about 99.6%
of current spam. For more on filtering see paulgraham.com.</p>
<p>In 2002 the lowest rate seemed to be about 00 to send a million
spams. That’s very cheap, 1/50th of a cent per spam. But filtering out
95% of spam, for example, would increase the spammers’ cost to reach a
given audience by a factor of 20. Few can have margins big enough to
absorb that.</p>

<p>Sullivan actually said “form ever follows function,“ but I think the
usual misquotation is closer to what modernist architects meant.</p>
<p>The engine of the Wright Flyer weighed 152 lbs. and generated 12 hp.
The F414-GE-400 jet engine used in the F-18 weighs 2,445 lbs. and
generates 22,000 lbs. of thrust. Assuming 1 lb. thrust = 1 hp., it
delivers about 114 times as much power per weight.</p>
<p>Current Intel processors, meanwhile, deliver about 1700 times the
processing power of those available 30 years ago.</p>

<p>Chapter 10</p>
<p>The most common way of breaking into computers takes advantage of
some idiosyncrasies of C. In C, when you set aside a chunk of memory (a
buffer) for some input you’re expecting, it gets allocated next to the
memory containing the return address of the currently running code. The
return address is the location in memory of the code that’s going to be
executed when the current code is done. It is, in effect, the next thing
on the computer’s to-do list.</p>
<p>So if someone wants to break into your computer, and they guess
you’re using a 256-byte buffer to store some kind of input, then by
sending just over 256 bytes they can overwrite the return address. When
the current code is done, control will pass to whatever location in
memory they’ve specified. And the location they’ll usually specify will
be the beginning of the buffer, which they’ve just filled up with the
machine language program of their choice. Bingo: their program is now
running on your computer.</p>
<p>In higher-level languages this would be impossible, but in C,
whenever you take input from outside and don’t check the length, you’ve
created a security hole. An attack that exploits such a hole is called a
buffer overflow attack. There are other ways to get control of a
computer in a buffer overflow attack, but overwriting the return address
is the classic method.</p>
<p>Curiously, airline hijackings are also buffer overflow attacks. In an
ordinary airliner, passengers and cockpit are adjacent, just as data and
code are adjacent in a C program. By overflowing into the cockpit,
hijackers in effect promote themselves from data to code.</p>
<p>Note to hackers: this is merely a metaphor. Do not attempt to drive a
Yugo with a jet engine bolted to the roof.</p>
<p>Arguably, the Yugojet phenomenon is not new. Fortran also owes its
popularity largely to its libraries.</p>

<p>Chapter 11</p>
<p>I believe Lisp Machine Lisp was the first language to embody the
principle that declarations (except those of dynamic variables) were
merely optimization advice, and would not change the meaning of a
correct program. Common Lisp seems to have been the first to state this
explicitly.</p>
<p>Chapter 12</p>
<p>Viaweb at first had two parts: the editor, written in Common Lisp,
which people used to build their sites, and the ordering system, written
in C, which handled orders. The first version was mostly Lisp, because
the ordering system was small.</p>
<p>In January 2003, Yahoo released a new version of the editor written
in C++ and Perl. But to translate this program into C++ they literally
had to write a Lisp interpreter: the source files of all the
page-generating templates are still, as far as I know, Lisp code. (See
Green spun’s Tenth Rule, Section 13.7.)</p>
<p>Robert says I didn’t need to be secretive, because even if our
competitors had known we were using Lisp, they wouldn’t have understood
why: “If they were that smart they’d already be programming in
Lisp.“</p>
<p>All languages are equally powerful in the sense of being
Turing-equivalent, but that’s not the sense of the word programmers care
about. (No one wants to program a Turing machine.) The kind of power
programmers care about may not be formally definable, but one way to
explain it would be to say that it refers to features you could only get
in the less powerful language by writing an interpreter for the more
powerful language in it. If language A has an operator for removing
spaces from strings and language B doesn’t, that probably doesn’t make A
more powerful, because you can probably write a subroutine to do it in
B. But if A supports, say, recursion, and B doesn’t, that’s not likely
to be something you can fix by writing library functions.</p>
<p>Or possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top. It’s not the shape
that matters here but the idea that there is at least a partial
order.</p>
<p>It is a bit misleading to treat macros as a separate feature. In
practice their usefulness is greatly enhanced by other Lisp features
like lexical closures and rest parameters.</p>
<p>As a result, comparisons of programming languages either take the
form of Religious wars or undergraduate textbooks so determinedly
neutral that they’re really works of anthropology. People who value
their peace, or want tenure, avoid the topic. But the question is only
half a religious one; there is something there worth studying,
especially if you want to design new languages.</p>

<p>After putting this essay online I got an apparently genuine email

<p>The IBM 704 CPU was about the size of a refrigerator, but a lot
heavier. The CPU weighed 3150 pounds, and the 4K of RAM was in a

<p>A hello-world program is a program that does nothing but print the
words “Hello, world!“ In Java you’d write:</p>
<p>public class Hello {</p>
<p>public static void main(String[] args) {</p>
<p>System.out.println(“Hello, world!“);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Someone who has never written a program probably looks at this and
wonders, why do you need to say so much to get the the computer to print
a message? Curiously, the reaction of experienced programmers is
identical.</p>
<p>In When the Air Hits Your Brain, neurosurgeon Frank Vertosick
recounts a conversation in which his chief resident, Gary, talks about
the difference between surgeons and internists (“fleas“):</p>
<p>Gary and I ordered a large pizza and found an open booth. The chief
lit a cigarette. “Look at those goddamn fleas, jabbering about some
disease they’ll see once in their lifetimes. That’s the trouble with
fleas, they only like the bizarre stuff. They hate their bread and
butter cases. That’s the difference between us and the fucking fleas.
See, we love big juicy lumbar disc herniations, but they hate
hypertension. . . . “</p>
<p>It’s hard to think of a lumbar disc herniation as juicy (except
literally). But I think I know what they mean. I’ve often had a juicy
bug to track down. Someone who’s not a programmer would find it hard to
imagine that there could be pleasure in a bug. Surely it’s better if
everything just works. And yet there is undeniably a grim satisfaction
in hunting down certain sorts of bugs.</p>
