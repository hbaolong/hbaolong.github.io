<h4 id="chapter-13.-revenge-of-the-nerds">Chapter 13. Revenge of the
Nerds</h4>
<p>In the software business there is an ongoing struggle between the
pointy-headed academics, and another equally formidable force, the
pointy-haired bosses. I believe everyone knows who the pointy-haired
boss is.1 I think most people in the technology world not only recognize
this cartoon character, but know the actual person in their company that
he is modelled upon.</p>
<p>The pointy-haired boss miraculously combines two qualities that are
common by themselves, but rarely seen together: (a) he knows nothing
whatsoever about technology, and (b) he has very strong opinions about
it.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, you need to write a piece of software. The
pointy-haired boss has no idea how this software has to work and can’t
tell one programming language from another, and yet he knows what
language you should write it in. Exactly. He thinks you should write it
in Java.</p>
<p>Why does he think this? Let’s take a look inside the brain of the
pointy-haired boss. What he’s thinking is something like this. Java is a
standard. I know it must be, because I read about it in the press all
the time. Since it is a standard, I won’t get in trouble for using it.
And that also means there will always be lots of Java programmers, so if
those working for me now quit, as programmers working for me
mysteriously always do, I can easily replace them.</p>
<p>Well, this doesn’t sound that unreasonable. But it’s all based on one
unspoken assumption, and that assumption turns out to be false. The
pointy-haired boss believes that all programming languages are pretty
much equivalent. If that were true, he would be right on target. If
languages are all equivalent, sure, use whatever language everyone else
is using.</p>
<p>But all languages are not equivalent, and I think I can prove this to
you without even getting into the differences between them. If you asked
the pointy-haired boss in 1992 what language software should be written
in, he would have answered with as little hesitation as he does today.
Software should be written in C++. But if languages are all equivalent,
why should the pointy-haired boss’s opinion ever change? In fact, why
should the developers of Java have even bothered to create a new
language?</p>
<p>Presumably, if you create anew language, it’s because you think it’s
better in some way than what people already had. And in fact, Gosling
makes it clear in the first Java white paper that Java was designed to
fix some problems with C++. So there you have it: languages are not all
equivalent. If you follow the trail through the pointy-haired boss’s
brain to Java and then back through Java’s history to its origins, you
end up holding an idea that contradicts the assumption you started
with.</p>
<p>So, who’s right? James Gosling, or the pointy-haired boss? Not
surprisingly, Gosling is right. Some languages are better, for certain
problems, than others. And you know, that raises some interesting
questions. Java was designed to be better, for certain problems, than
C++. What problems? When is Java better and when is C++? Are there
situations where other languages are better than either of them?</p>
<p>Once you start considering this question, you’ve opened a real can of
worms. If the pointy-haired boss had to think about the problem in its
full complexity, it would make his head explode. As long as he considers
all languages equivalent, all he has to do is choose the one that seems
to have the most momentum, and since that’s more a question of fashion
than technology, even he can probably get the right answer. But if
languages vary, he suddenly has to solve two simultaneous equations,
trying to find an optimal balance between two things he knows nothing
about: the relative suitability of the twenty or so leading languages
for the problem he needs to solve, and the odds of finding programmers,
libraries, etc. for each. If that’s what’s on the other side of the
door, it is no surprise that the pointy-haired boss doesn’t want to open
it.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of believing that all programming languages are
equivalent is that it’s not true. But the advantage is that it makes
your life a lot simpler. And I think that’s the main reason the idea is
so widespread. It is a comfortable idea.</p>
<p>We know that Java must be pretty good, because it is the cool, new
programming language. Or is it? If you look at the world of programming
languages from a distance, it looks like Java is the latest thing. (From
far enough away, all you can see is the large, flashing billboard paid
for by Sun.) But if you look at this world up close, you find there are
degrees of coolness. Within the hacker subculture, there is another
language called Perl that is considered a lot cooler than Java.
Slashdot, for example, is generated by Perl. I don’t think you would
find those guys using Java Server Pages. But there is another, newer
language, called Python, whose users tend to look down on Perl, and
another called Ruby that some see as the heir apparent of Python.</p>
<p>If you look at these languages in order, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby,
you notice an interesting pattern. At least, you notice this pattern if
you are a Lisp hacker. Each one is progressively more like Lisp. Python
copies even features that many Lisp hackers consider to be mistakes. And
if you’d shown people Ruby in 1975 and described it as a dialect of Lisp
with syntax, no one would have argued with you. Programming languages
have almost caught up with 1958.</p>
<p>Catching Up with Math</p>
<p>What I mean is that Lisp was first discovered by John McCarthy in
1958, and popular programming languages are only now catching up with
the ideas he developed then.</p>
<p>Now, how could that be true? Isn’t computer technology something that
changes very rapidly? In1958, computers were refrigerator-sized
behemoths with the processing power of a wristwatch.2 How could any
technology that old even be relevant, let alone superior to the latest
developments?</p>
<p>Figure 13-1. IBM 704, Lawrence Livermore, 1956.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you how. It’s because Lisp was not really designed to be a
programming language, at least not in the sense we mean today. What we
mean by a programming language is something we use to tell a computer
what to do. McCarthy did eventually intend to develop a programming
language in this sense, but the Lisp we actually ended up with was based
on something separate that he did as a theoretical exercise—an effort to
define a more convenient alternative to the Turing machine. As McCarthy
said later,</p>
<p>Another way to show that Lisp was neater than Turing machines was to
write a universal Lisp function and show that it is briefer and more
comprehensible than the description of a universal Turing machine. This
was the Lisp function eval…, which computes the value of a Lisp
expression….Writing eval required inventing a notation representing Lisp
functions as Lisp data, and such a notation was devised for the purposes
of the paper with no thought that it would be used to express Lisp
programs in practice.</p>
<p>Figure 13-2. Alpha nerd: John McCarthy.</p>
<p>But in late1958, Steve Russell,3 one of McCarthy’s grad students,
looked at this definition of eval and realized that if he translated it
into machine language, the result would be a Lisp interpreter.</p>
<p>This was a big surprise at the time. Here is what McCarthy said about
it later:</p>
<p>Steve Russell said, look, why don’t I program this eval…, and I said
to him, ho, ho, you’re confusing theory with practice, this eval is
intended for reading, not for computing. But he went ahead and did it.
That is, he compiled the eval in my paper into[IBM] 704machine code,
fixing bugs, and then advertised this as a Lisp interpreter, which it
certainly was. So at that point Lisp had essentially the form that it
has today….</p>
<p>Suddenly, in a matter of weeks, McCarthy found his theoretical
exercise transformed into an actual programming language—and a more
powerful one than he had intended.</p>
<p>So the short explanation of why this 1950s language is not obsolete
is that it was not technology but math, and math doesn’t get stale. The
right thing to compare Lisp to is not 1950s hardware but the Quick sort
algorithm, which was discovered in 1960 and is still the fastest
general-purpose sort.</p>
<p>There is one other language still surviving from the 1950s, Fortran,
and it represents the opposite approach to language design. Lisp was a
piece of theory that unexpectedly got turned into a programming
language. Fortran was developed intentionally as a programming language,
but what we would now consider a very low-level one.</p>
<p>Fortran I, the language that was developed in 1956, was a very
different animal from present-day Fortran. Fortran I was pretty much
assembly language with math. In some ways it was less powerful than more
recent assembly languages; there were no subroutines, for example, only
branches. Present-day Fortran is now arguably closer to Lisp than to
Fortran I.</p>
<p>Lisp and Fortran were the trunks of two separate evolutionary trees,
one rooted in math and one rooted in machine architecture. These two
trees have been converging ever since. Lisp started out powerful, and
over the next twenty years got fast. So-called mainstream languages
started out fast, and over the next forty years gradually got more
powerful, until now the most advanced of them are fairly close to Lisp.
Close, but they are still missing a few things.</p>
<p>What Made Lisp Different</p>
<p>When it was first developed, Lisp embodied nine new ideas. Some of
these we now take for granted, others are only seen in more advanced
languages, and two are still unique to Lisp. The nine ideas are, in
order of their adoption by the mainstream,</p>
<p>Conditionals. A conditional is an if-then-else construct. We take
these for granted now, but Fortran I didn’t have them. It had only a
conditional go to closely based on the underlying machine
instruction.</p>
<p>A function type. In Lisp, functions are a data type just like
integers or strings. They have a literal representation, can be stored
in variables, can be passed as arguments, and so on.</p>
<p>Recursion. Lisp was the first high-level language to support
recursive functions.4</p>
<p>Dynamic typing. In Lisp, all variables are effectively pointers.
Values are what have types, not variables, and assigning values to
variables means copying pointers, not what they point to.</p>
<p>Garbage-collection.</p>
<p>Programs composed of expressions. Lisp programs are trees of
expressions, each of which returns a value. This is in contrast to
Fortran and most succeeding languages, which distinguish between
expressions and statements.</p>
<p>This distinction was natural in Fortran I because you could not nest
statements. So while you needed expressions for math to work, there was
no point in making anything else return a value, because there could not
be anything waiting for it.</p>
<p>This limitation went away with the arrival of block-structured
languages, but by then it was too late. The distinction between
expressions and statements was entrenched. It spread from Fortran into
Algol and then to both their descendants.</p>
<p>A symbol type. Symbols are effectively pointers to strings stored in
a hash table. So you can test equality by comparing a pointer, instead
of comparing each character.</p>
<p>A notation for code using trees of symbols and constants.</p>
<p>The whole language there all the time. There is no real distinction
between read-time, compile-time, and runtime. You can compile or run
code while reading, read or run code while compiling, and read or
compile code at runtime.</p>
<p>Running code at read-time lets users reprogram Lisp’s syntax; running
code at compile-time is the basis of macros; compiling at runtime is the
basis of Lisp’s use as an extension language in programs like Emacs; and
reading at runtime enables programs to communicate using s-expressions,
an idea recently reinvented as XML.5</p>
<p>When Lisp first appeared, these ideas were far removed from ordinary
programming practice, which was dictated largely by the hardware
available in the late 1950s. Over time, the default language, embodied
in a succession of popular languages, has gradually evolved toward Lisp.
Ideas 1-5 are now widespread. Number 6 is starting to appear in the
mainstream. Python has a form of 7, though there doesn’t seem to be any
syntax for it.</p>
<p>As for number 8, this may be the most interesting of the lot. Ideas
8and 9 only became part of Lisp by accident, because Steve Russell
implemented something McCarthy had never intended to be implemented. And
yet these ideas turn out to be responsible for both Lisp’s strange
appearance and its most distinctive features. Lisp looks strange not so
much because it has a strange syntax as because it has no syntax; you
express programs directly in the parse trees that get built behind the
scenes when other languages are parsed, and these trees are made of
lists, which are Lisp data structures.</p>
<p>Expressing the language in its own data structures turns out to be a
very powerful feature. Ideas 8 and 9 together mean that you can write
programs that write programs. That may sound like a bizarre idea, but
it’s an everyday thing in Lisp. The most common way to do it is with
something called a macro.</p>
<p>The term “macro“ does not mean in Lisp what it means in other
languages. A Lisp macro can be anything from an abbreviation to a
compiler for a new language. If you really want to understand Lisp, or
just expand your programming horizons, I would learn more about
macros.</p>
<p>Macros (in the Lisp sense) are still, as far as I know, unique to
Lisp. This is partly because in order to have macros you probably have
to make your language look as strange as Lisp. It may also be because if
you do add that final increment of power, you can no longer claim to
have invented a new language, but only a new dialect of Lisp.</p>
<p>I mention this mostly as a joke, but it is quite true. If you define
a language that has car, cdr, cons, quote, cond, atom, eq, and a
notation for functions expressed as lists, then you can build all the
rest of Lisp out of it. That is in fact the defining quality of Lisp: it
was in order to make this so that McCarthy gave Lisp the shape it
has.</p>
<p>Where Languages Matter</p>
<p>Even if Lisp does represent a kind of limit that mainstream languages
are approaching asymptotically, does that mean you should actually use
it to write software? How much do you lose by using a less powerful
language? Isn’t it wiser, sometimes, not to be at the very edge of
innovation? And isn’t popularity to some extent its own justification?
Isn’t the pointy-haired boss right, for example, to want to use a
language for which he can easily hire programmers?</p>
<p>There are, of course, projects where the choice of programming
language doesn’t matter much. As a rule, the more demanding the
application, the more leverage you get from using a powerful language.
But plenty of projects are not demanding at all. Most programming
probably consists of writing little glue programs, and for little glue
programs you can use any language that you’re already familiar with and
that has good libraries for whatever you need to do. If you just need to
feed data from one Windows app to another, sure, use Visual Basic.</p>
<p>You can write little glue programs in Lisp too (I use it as a desktop
calculator), but the biggest win for languages like Lisp is at the other
end of the spectrum, where you need to write sophisticated programs to
solve hard problems in the face of fierce competition. A good example is
the airline fare search program that ITA Software licenses to Orbitz.
These guys entered a market already dominated by two big, entrenched
competitors, Travelocity and Expedia, and seem to have just humiliated
them technologically.</p>
<p>The core of ITA’s application is a 200,000-line Common Lisp program
that searches many orders of magnitude more possibilities than their
competitors, who apparently are still using mainframe-era programming
techniques. I have never seen any of ITA’s code, but according to one of
their top hackers they use a lot of macros, and I am not surprised to
hear it.</p>
<p>Centripetal Forces</p>
<p>I’m not saying there is no cost to using uncommon technologies. The
pointy-haired boss is not completely mistaken to worry about this. But
because he doesn’t understand the risks, he tends to magnify them.</p>
<p>I can think of three problems that could arise from using less common
languages. Your programs might not work well with programs written in
other languages. You might have fewer libraries at your disposal. And
you might have trouble hiring programmers.</p>
<p>How big a problem is each of these? The importance of the first
varies depending on whether you have control over the whole system. If
you’re writing software that has to run on a remote user’s machine on
top of a buggy, proprietary operating system (I mention no names), there
may be advantages to writing your application in the same language as
the OS. But if you control the whole system and have the source code of
all the parts, as ITA presumably does, you can use whatever languages
you want. If any incompatibility arises, you can fix it yourself.</p>
<p>In server-based applications you can get away with using the most
advanced technologies, and I think this is the main cause of what
Jonathan Erickson calls the “programming language renaissance.“ This is
why we even hear about new languages like Perl and Python. We’re not
hearing about these languages because people are using them to write
Windows apps, but because people are using them on servers. And as
software shifts off the desktop and onto servers (a future even
Microsoft seems resigned to), there will be less and less pressure to
use middle-of-the-road technologies.</p>
<p>As for libraries, their importance also depends on the application.
For less demanding problems, the availability of libraries can outweigh
the intrinsic power of the language. Where is the breakeven point? Hard
to say exactly, but wherever it is, it is short of anything you’d be
likely to call an application. If a company considers it self to be in
the software business, and they’re writing an application that will be
one of their products, then it will probably involve several hackers and
take at least six months to write. In a project of that size, powerful
languages probably start to outweigh the convenience of pre-existing
libraries.</p>
<p>The third worry of the pointy-haired boss, the difficulty of hiring
programmers, I think is a red herring. How many hackers do you need to
hire, after all? Surely by now we all know that software is best
developed by teams of less than ten people. And you shouldn’t have
trouble hiring hackers on that scale for any language anyone has ever
heard of. If you can’t find ten Lisp hackers, then your company is
probably based in the wrong city for developing software.</p>
<p>In fact, choosing a more powerful language probably decreases the
size of the team you need, because (a) if you use a more powerful
language, you probably won’t need as many hackers, and (b) hackers who
work in more advanced languages are likely to be smarter.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that you won’t get a lot of pressure to use what are
perceived as “standard“ technologies. At Via web we raised some eyebrows
among VCs and potential acquirers by using Lisp. But we also raised
eyebrows by using generic Intel boxes as servers instead of “industrial
strength“ servers like Suns, for using a then-obscure open source Unix
called FreeBSD instead of a real commercial OS like Windows NT, for
ignoring a supposed e-commerce standard called SET that no one now even
remembers, and so on.</p>
<p>You can’t let the suits make technical decisions for you. Did it
alarm potential acquirers that we used Lisp? Some, slightly, but if we
hadn’t used Lisp, we wouldn’t have been able to write the software that
made them want to buy us. What seemed like an anomaly to them was in
fact cause and effect.</p>
<p>If you start a startup, don’t design your product to please VCs or
potential acquirers. Design your product to please the users. If you win
the users, everything else will follow. And if you don’t, no one will
care how comfortingly orthodox your technology choices were.</p>
<p>The Cost of Being Average</p>
<p>How much do you lose by using a less powerful language? There is
actually some data out there about that.</p>
<p>The most convenient measure of power is probably code size. The point
of high-level languages is to give you bigger abstractions—bigger
bricks, as it were, so you don’t need as many to build a wall of a given
size. So the more powerful the language, the shorter the program (not
simply in characters, of course, but in distinct elements).</p>
<p>How does a more powerful language enable you to write shorter
programs? One technique you can use, if the language will let you, is
something called bottom-up programming. Instead of simply writing your
application in the base language, you build on top of the base language
a language for writing programs like yours, then write your program in
it. The combined code can be much shorter than if you had written your
whole program in the base language—indeed, this is how most compression
algorithms work. A bottom-up program should be easier to modify as well,
because in many cases the language layer won’t have to change at
all.</p>
<p>Code size is important, because the time it takes to write a program
depends mostly on its length. If your program would be three times as
long in another language, it will take three times as long to write—and
you can’t get around this by hiring more people, because beyond a
certain size new hires are actually a net lose. Fred Brooks described
this phenomenon in his famous book The Mythical Man-Month, and
everything I’ve seen has tended to confirm what he said.</p>
<p>So how much shorter are your programs if you write them in Lisp? Most
of the numbers I’ve heard for Lisp versus C, for example, have been
around 7-10x. But a recent article about ITA in New Architect magazine
said that “one line of Lisp can replace 20 lines of C,“ and since this
article was full of quotes from ITA’s president, I assume they got this
number from ITA.6 If so then we can put some faith in it; ITA’s software
includes a lot of C and C++ as well as Lisp, so they are speaking from
experience.</p>
<p>My guess is that these multiples aren’t even constant. I think they
increase when you face harder problems and also when you have smarter
programmers. A really good hacker can squeeze more out of better
tools.</p>
<p>As one data point on the curve, at any rate, if you were to compete
with ITA and chose to write your software in C, they would be able to
develop software twenty times faster than you. If you spent a year on a
new feature, they’d be able to duplicate it in less than three weeks.
Whereas if they spent just three months developing something new, it
would be five years before you had it too.</p>
<p>And you know what? That’s the best-case scenario. When you talk about
code-size ratios, you’re implicitly assuming that you can actually write
the program in the weaker language. But in fact there are limits on what
programmers can do. If you’re trying to solve a hard problem with a
language that’s too low-level, you reach a point where there is just too
much to keep in your head at once.</p>
<p>So when I say it would take ITA’s imaginary competitor five years to
duplicate something ITA could write in Lisp in three months, I mean five
years if nothing goes wrong. In fact, the way things work in most
companies, any development project that would take five years is likely
never to get finished at all.</p>
<p>I admit this is an extreme case. ITA’s hackers seem to be unusually
smart, and C is a pretty low-level language. But in a competitive
market, even a differential of two or three to one would be enough to
guarantee that you’d always be behind.</p>
<p>A Recipe</p>
<p>This is the kind of possibility that the pointy-haired boss doesn’t
even want to think about. And so most of them don’t. Because, you know,
when it comes down to it, the pointy-haired boss doesn’t mind if his
company gets their ass kicked, so long as no one can prove it’s his
fault. The safest plan for him personally is to stick close to the
center of the herd.</p>
<p>Within large organizations, the phrase used to describe this approach
is “industry best practice.“ Its purpose is to shield the pointy-haired
boss from responsibility: if he chooses something that is “industry best
practice,“ and the company loses, he can’t be blamed. He didn’t choose,
the industry did.</p>
<p>I believe this term was originally used to describe accounting
methods and so on. What it means, roughly, is don’t do anything weird.
And in accounting that’s probably a good idea. The terms “cutting-edge“
and “accounting“ do not sound good together. But when you import this
criterion into decisions about technology, you start to get the wrong
answers.</p>
<p>Technology often should be cutting-edge. In programming languages, as
Erann Gat has pointed out, what “industry best practice“ actually gets
you is not the best, but merely the average. When a decision causes you
to develop software at a fraction of the rate of more aggressive
competitors, “best practice“ does not really seem the right name for
it.</p>
<p>So here we have two pieces of information that I think are very
valuable. In fact, I know it from my own experience. Number 1, languages
vary in power. Number 2, most managers deliberately ignore this. Between
them, these two facts are literally a recipe for making money. ITA is an
example of this recipe in action. If you want to win in a software
business, just take on the hardest problem you can find, use the most
powerful language you can get, and wait for your competitors’
pointy-haired bosses to revert to the mean.</p>
