<h4 id="chapter-7.-mind-the-gap">Chapter 7. Mind the Gap</h4>
<p>When people care enough about something to do it well, those who do
it best tend to be far better than everyone else. There’s a huge gap
between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like Borgognone. You see
the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the average writer of
detective novels. A top-ranked professional chess player could play ten
thousand games against an ordinary club player without losing once.</p>
<p>Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very
specialized skill. But for some reason we treat this skill differently.
No one complains when a few people surpass all the rest at playing chess
or writing novels, but when a few people make more money than the rest,
we get editorials saying this is wrong.</p>
<p>Why? The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other
skill. What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is making
money?</p>
<p>I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different:
the misleading model of wealth we learn as children; the disreputable
way in which, till recently, most fortunes were accumulated; and the
worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for society. As
far as I can tell, the first is mistaken, the second outdated, and the
third empirically false. Could it be that, in a modern democracy,
variation in income is actually a sign of health?</p>
<p>The Daddy Model of Wealth</p>
<p>When I was five I thought electricity was created by electric
sockets. I didn’t realize there were power plants out there generating
it. Likewise, it doesn’t occur to most kids that wealth is something
that has to be generated. It seems to be something that flows from
parents.</p>
<p>Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it, children
tend to misunderstand wealth. They confuse it with money. They think
that there is a fixed amount of it. And they think of it as something
that’s distributed by authorities (and so should be distributed
equally), rather than something that has to be created (and might be
created unequally).</p>
<p>In fact, wealth is not money. Money is just a convenient way of
trading one form of wealth for another. Wealth is the underlying
stuff—the goods and services we buy. When you travel to a rich or poor
country, you don’t have to look at people’s bank accounts to tell which
kind you’re in. You can see wealth—in buildings and streets, in the
clothes and the health of the people.</p>
<p>Where does wealth come from? People make it. This was easier to grasp
when most people lived on farms, and made many of the things they wanted
with their own hands. Then you could see in the house, the herds, and
the granary the wealth that each family created. It was obvious then too
that the wealth of the world was not a fixed quantity that had to be
shared out, like slices of a pie. If you wanted more wealth, you could
make it.</p>
<p>This is just as true today, though few of us create wealth directly
for ourselves (except for a few vestigial domestic tasks). Mostly we
create wealth for other people in exchange for money, which we then
trade for the forms of wealth we want.1</p>
<p>Because kids are unable to create wealth, whatever they have has to
be given to them. And when wealth is something you’re given, then of
course it seems that it should be distributed equally.2 As in most
families it is. The kids see to that. “Unfair,“ they cry, when one
sibling gets more than another.</p>
<p>In the real world, you can’t keep living off your parents. If you
want something, you either have to make it, or do something of
equivalent value for someone else, in order to get them to give you
enough money to buy it. In the real world, wealth is (except for a few
specialists like thieves and speculators) something you have to create,
not something that’s distributed by Daddy. And since the ability and
desire to create it vary from person to person, it’s not made
equally.</p>
<p>You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who
make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. Top
actors make a lot more money than B-list actors. The B-list actors might
be almost as charismatic, but when people go to the theater and look at
the list of movies playing, they want that extra oomph that the big
stars have.</p>
<p>Doing what people want is not the only way to get money, of course.
You could also rob banks, or solicit bribes, or establish a monopoly.
Such tricks account for some variation in wealth, and indeed for some of
the biggest individual fortunes, but they are not the root cause of
variation in income. The root cause of variation in income, as Occam’s
Razor implies, is the same as the root cause of variation in every other
human skill.</p>
<p>In the United States, the CEO of a large public company makes about
100 times as much as the average person.3 Basketball players make about
128 times as much, and baseball players 72 times as much. Editorials
quote this kind of statistic with horror. But I have no trouble
imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive as another.
In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending
on their skills.4 And that’s without considering motivation, or the
extra leverage in productivity that you can get from modern
technology.</p>
<p>Editorials about athletes’ or CEOs’ salaries remind me of early
Christian writers, arguing from first principles about whether the Earth
was round, when they could just walk outside and check.5 How much
someone’s work is worth is not a policy question. It’s something the
market already determines.</p>
<p>“Are they really worth 100 of us?“ editorialists ask. Depends on what
you mean by worth. If you mean worth in the sense of what people will
pay for their skills, the answer is yes, apparently.</p>
<p>A few CEOs’ incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing. But are there
not others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate?
Steve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline. And not
merely in the way a turnaround specialist does, by cutting costs; he had
to decide what Apple’s next products should be. Few others could have
done it. And regardless of the case with CEOs, it’s hard to see how
anyone could argue that the salaries of professional basketball players
don’t reflect supply and demand.</p>
<p>It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really
generate so much more wealth than another. The key to this mystery is to
revisit that question, are they really worth 100 of us? Would a
basketball team trade one of their players for 100 random people? What
would Apple’s next product look like if you replaced Steve Jobs with a
committee of 100 random people?6 These things don’t scale linearly.
Perhaps the CEO or the professional athlete has only ten times (whatever
that means) the skill and determination of an ordinary person. But it
makes all the difference that it’s concentrated in one individual.</p>
<p>When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid,
what are we really saying? In a free market, prices are determined by
what buyers want. People like baseball more than poetry, so baseball
players make more than poets. To say that a certain kind of work is
underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want the wrong
things.</p>
<p>Well, of course people want the wrong things. It seems odd to be
surprised by that. And it seems even odder to say that it’s unjust that
certain kinds of work are underpaid.7 Then you’re saying that it’s
unjust that people want the wrong things. It’s lamentable that people
prefer reality TV and corndogs to Shakespeare and steamed vegetables,
but unjust? That seems like saying that blue is heavy, or that up is
circular.</p>
<p>The appearance of word “unjust“ here is the unmistakable spectral
signature of the Daddy Model. Why else would this idea occur in this odd
context? Whereas if the speaker were still operating on the Daddy Model,
and saw wealth as something that flowed from a common source and had to
be shared out, rather than something generated by doing what other
people wanted, this is exactly what you’d get on noticing that some
people made much more than others.</p>
<p>When we talk about “unequal distribution of income,“ we should also
ask, where does that income come from?8 Who made the wealth it
represents? Because to the extent that income varies simply according to
how much wealth people create, the distribution may be unequal, but it’s
hardly unjust.</p>
<p>Stealing It</p>
<p>The second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth
alarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulate a
fortune was to steal it: in pastoral societies by cattle raiding; in
agricultural societies by appropriating others’ estates in times of war,
and taxing them in times of peace.</p>
<p>In conflicts, those on the winning side would receive the estates
confiscated from the losers. In England in the 1060s, when William the
Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo-Saxon nobles to
his followers, the conflict was military. By the 1530s, when Henry VIII
distributed the estates of the monasteries to his followers,9 it was
mostly political. But the principle was the same. Indeed, the same
principle is at work now in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>In more organized societies, like China, the ruler and his officials
used taxation instead of confiscation. But here too we see the same
principle: the way to get rich was not to create wealth, but to serve a
ruler powerful enough to appropriate it.</p>
<p>This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class.
Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor
poor, but originally they were a distinct group. In a feudal society,
there are just two classes: a warrior aristocracy, and the serfs who
work their estates. The middle class were a new, third group who lived
in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade.</p>
<p>Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries, petty nobles and former
serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful enough to
ignore the local feudal lords.10 Like serfs, the middle class made a
living largely by creating wealth. (In port cities like Genoa and Pisa,
they also engaged in piracy.) But unlike serfs they had an incentive to
create a lot of it. Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master.
There was not much point in making more than you could hide. Whereas the
independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they
created.</p>
<p>Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, society as a
whole started to get richer very rapidly. Nearly everything we have was
created by the middle class. Indeed, the other two classes have
effectively disappeared in industrial societies, and their names been
given to either end of the middle class. (In the original sense of the
word, Bill Gates is middle class.)</p>
<p>But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation
definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich. In
England, at least, corruption only became unfashionable (and in fact
only started to be called “corruption“) when there started to be other,
faster ways to get rich.</p>
<p>Seventeenth-century England was much like the third world today, in
that government office was a recognized route to wealth. The great
fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would now call
corruption than from commerce.11 By the nineteenth century that had
changed. There continued to be bribes, as there still are everywhere,
but politics had by then been left to men who were driven more by vanity
than greed. Technology had made it possible to create wealth faster than
you could steal it. The prototypical rich man of the nineteenth century
was not a courtier but an industrialist.</p>
<p>With the rise of the middle class, wealth stopped being a zero sum
game. Jobs and Wozniak didn’t have to make us poor to make themselves
rich. Quite the opposite: they created things that made our lives
materially richer. They had to, or we wouldn’t have paid for them.</p>
<p>But since for most of the world’s history the main route to wealth
was to steal it, we tend to be suspicious of rich people. Idealistic
undergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child’s model of
wealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past. It is a case of the
mistaken meeting the outdated.</p>
<p>“Behind every great fortune, there is a crime,“ Balzac wrote. Except
he didn’t. What he actually said was that a great fortune With no
apparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed that it
had been forgotten. If we were talking about Europe in 1000, or most of
the third world today, the standard misquotation would be spot on. But
Balzac lived in nineteenth-century France, where the Industrial
Revolution was well advanced. He knew you could make a fortune without
stealing it. After all, he did himself, as a popular novelist.12</p>
<p>Only a few countries (by no coincidence, the richest ones) have
reached this stage. In most, corruption still has the upper hand. In
most, the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it. And so when we
see increasing differences in income in a rich country, there is a
tendency to worry that it’s sliding back toward becoming another
Venezuela. I think the opposite is happening. I think you’re seeing a
country a full step ahead of Venezuela.</p>
<p>The Lever of Technology</p>
<p>Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor? It will
certainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive.
That’s the whole point of technology. With a tractor an energetic farmer
could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with a team of
horses. But only if he mastered a new kind of farming.</p>
<p>I’ve seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time. In
high school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at
Baskin-Robbins. This was the only kind of work available at the time.
Now high school kids could write software or design web sites. But only
some of them will; the rest will still be scooping ice cream.</p>
<p>I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it
possible for me to buy a computer of my own. Within months I was using
it to make money as a freelance programmer. A few years before, I
couldn’t have done this. A few years before, there was no such thing as
a freelance programmer. But Apple painters created wealth, in the form
of powerful, inexpensive computers, and programmers immediately set to
work using it to create more.</p>
<p>As this example suggests, the rate at which technology increases our
productive capacity is probably polynomial, rather than linear. So we
should expect to see ever-increasing variation in individual
productivity as time goes on. Will that increase the gap between rich
and the poor? Depends which gap you mean.</p>
<p>Technology should increase the gap in income, but it seems to
decrease other gaps. A hundred years ago, the rich led a different kind
of life from ordinary people. They lived in houses full of servants,
wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes, and travelled about in carriages
drawn by teams of horses which themselves required their own houses and
servants. Now, thanks to technology, the rich live more like the average
person.</p>
<p>Cars are a good example of why. It’s possible to buy expensive,
handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. But there is
not much point. Companies make more money by building a large number of
ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones. So a company making
a mass-produced car can afford to spend a lot more on its design. If you
buy a custom-made car, something will always be breaking. The only point
of buying one now is to advertise that you can.</p>
<p>Or consider watches. Fifty years ago, by spending a lot of money on a
watch you could get better performance. When watches had mechanical
movements, expensive watches kept better time. Not any more. Since the
invention of the quartz movement, an ordinary Timex is more accurate
than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.13
Indeed, as with expensive cars, if you’re determined to spend a lot of
money on a watch, you have to put up with some inconvenience to do it:
as well as keeping worse time, mechanical watches have to be wound.</p>
<p>The only thing technology can’t cheapen is brand. Which is precisely
why we hear ever more about it. Brand is the residue left as the
substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate. But what label
you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having it versus
not having it. In 1900, if you kept a carriage, no one asked what year
or brand it was. If you had one, you were rich. And if you weren’t rich,
you took the omnibus or walked. Now even the poorest Americans drive
cars, and it is only because we’re so well trained by advertising that
we can even recognize the especially expensive ones.14</p>
<p>The same pattern has played out in industry after industry. If there
is enough demand for something, technology will make it cheap enough to
sell in large volumes,15 and the mass-produced versions will be, if not
better, at least more convenient. And there is nothing the rich like
more than convenience. The rich people I know drive the same cars, wear
the same clothes, have the same kind of furniture, and eat the same
foods as my other friends. Their houses are in different neighborhoods,
or if in the same neighborhood are different sizes, but within them life
is similar. The houses are made using the same construction techniques
and contain much the same objects. It’s inconvenient to do something
expensive and custom.</p>
<p>The rich spend their time more like everyone else too. Bertie Wooster
seems long gone. Now, most people who are rich enough not to work do
anyway. It’s not just social pressure that makes them; idleness is
lonely and demoralizing.</p>
<p>Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years
ago. The novels and etiquette manuals of that period read now like
descriptions of some strange tribal society. “With respect to the
continuance of friendships. . . “ hints Mrs. Beeton’s Book of Household
Management (1880), “it may be found necessary, in some cases, for a
mistress to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility of a household,
many of those commenced in the earlier part of her life.“ A woman who
married a rich man was expected to drop friends who didn’t. You’d seem a
barbarian if you behaved that way today. You’d also have a very boring
life. People still tend to segregate themselves somewhat, but much more
on the basis of education than wealth.16</p>
<p>Materially and socially, technology seems to be decreasing the gap
between the rich and the poor, not increasing it. If Lenin walked around
the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco, he’d think
communism had won. Everyone would be wearing the same clothes, have the
same kind of office (or rather, cubicle) with the same furnishings, and
address one another by their first names instead of by honorifics.
Everything would seem exactly as he’d predicted, until he looked at
their bank accounts. Oops.</p>
<p>Is it a problem if technology increases that gap? It doesn’t seem to
be so far. As it increases the gap in income, it seems to decrease most
other gaps.</p>
<p>Alternative to an Axiom</p>
<p>One often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would
increase the income gap between rich and poor. As if it were an axiom
that this would be bad. It might be true that increased variation in
income would be bad, but I don’t see how we can say it’s axiomatic.</p>
<p>Indeed, it may even be false, in industrial democracies. In a society
of serfs and warlords, certainly, variation in income is a sign of an
underlying problem. But serfdom is not the only cause of variation in
income. A 747 pilot doesn’t make 40 times as much as a checkout clerk
because he is a warlord who somehow holds her in thrall. His skills are
simply much more valuable.</p>
<p>I’d like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society,
increasing variation in income is a sign of health. Technology seems to
increase the variation in productivity at faster than linear rates. If
we don’t see corresponding variation in income, there are three possible
explanations: (a) that technical innovation has stopped, (b) that the
people who would create the most wealth aren’t doing it, or (c) that
they aren’t getting paid for it.</p>
<p>I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad. If you
disagree, try living for a year using only the resources available to
the average Frankish nobleman in 800, and report back to us. (I’ll be
generous and not send you back to the stone age.)</p>
<p>The only option, if you’re going to have an increasingly prosperous
society without increasing variation in income, seems to be (c), that
people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it. That Jobs
and Wozniak, for example, will cheerfully work 20- hour days to produce
the Apple computer for a society that allows them, after taxes, to keep
just enough of their income to match what they would have made working 9
to 5 at a big company.</p>
<p>Will people create wealth if they can’t get paid for it? Only if it’s
fun. People will write operating systems for free. But they won’t
install them, or take support calls, or train customers to use them. And
at least 90% of the work that even the highest tech companies do is of
this second, unedifying kind.</p>
<p>All the un fun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a
society that confiscates private fortunes. We can confirm this
empirically. Suppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due
to a nearby fan. You turn the fan off, and the noise stops. You turn the
fan back on, and the noise starts again. Off, quiet. On, noise. In the
absence of other information, it would seem the noise is caused by the
fan.</p>
<p>At various times and places in history, whether you could accumulate
a fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off. Northern Italy
in 800, off (warlords would steal it). Northern Italy in 1100, on.
Central France in 1100, off (still feudal). England in 1800, on. England
in 1974, off (98% tax on investment income). United States in 1974, on.
We’ve even had a twin study: West Germany, on; East Germany, off. In
every case, the creation of wealth seems to appear and disappear like
the noise of a fan as you switch on and off the prospect of keeping
it.</p>
<p>There is some momentum involved. It probably takes at least a
generation to turn people into East Germans (luckily for England). But
if it were merely a fan we were studying, without all the extra baggage
that comes from the controversial topic of wealth, no one would have any
doubt that the fan was causing the noise.</p>
<p>If you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private
fortunes, as feudal rulers used to do, or by taxing them away, as some
modern governments have done, the result always seems to be the same.
Society as a whole ends up poorer.</p>
<p>If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially much
better off than I am now, but was among the poorest, or in one where I
was the richest, but much worse off than I am now, I’d take the first
option. If I had children, it would arguably be immoral not to. It’s
absolute poverty you want to avoid, not relative poverty. If, as the
evidence so far implies, you have to have one or the other in your
society, take relative poverty.</p>
<p>You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending
their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do to get
rich. I’m not talking about the trickle-down effect here. I’m not saying
that if you let Henry Ford get rich, he’ll hire you as a waiter at his
next party. I’m saying that he’ll make you a tractor to replace your
horse.</p>
