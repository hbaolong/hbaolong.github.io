<h4 id="preface">Preface</h4>
<p>This book is an attempt to explain to the world at large what goes on
in the world of computers. So it’s not just for programmers. For
example, Chapter 6 is about how to get rich. I believe this is a topic
of general interest.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that a lot of the people getting rich in the
last thirty years have been programmers. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry
Ellison. Why? Why programmers, rather than civil engineers or
photographers or actuaries? “How to Make Wealth“ explains why.</p>
<p>The money in software is one instance of a more general trend, and
that trend is the theme of this book. This is the Computer Age. It was
supposed to be the Space Age, or the Atomic Age. But those were just
names invented by PR people. Computers have had far more effect on the
form of our lives than space travel or nuclear technology.</p>
<p>Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is
gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into one. So has
your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car has more processing power in it
than a room-sized mainframe had in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias,
newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the
Internet. So if you want to understand where we are, and where we’re
going, it will help if you understand what’s going on inside the heads
of hackers.</p>
<p>Hackers? Aren’t those the people who break into computers? Among
outsiders, that’s what the word means. But within the computer world,
expert programmers refer to themselves as hackers. And since the purpose
of this book is to explain how things really are in our world, I decided
it was worth the risk to use the words we use.</p>
<p>The earlier chapters answer questions we have probably all thought
about. What makes a startup succeed? Will technology create a gap
between those who understand it and those who don’t? What do programmers
do? Why do kids who can’t master high school end up as some of the most
powerful people in the world? Will Microsoft take over the Internet?
What to do about spam?</p>
<p>Several later chapters are about something most people outside the
computer world haven’t thought about: programming languages. Why should
you care about programming languages? Because if you want to understand
hacking, this is the thread to follow—just as, if you wanted to
understand the technology of 1880, steam engines were the thread to
follow.</p>
<p>Computer programs are all just text. And the language you choose
determines what you can say. Programming languages are what programmers
think in.</p>
<p>Naturally, this has a big effect on the kind of thoughts they have.
And you can see it in the software they write. Orbitz, the travel web
site, managed to break into a market dominated by two very formidable
competitors: Sabre, who owned electronic reservations for decades, and
Microsoft. How on earth did Orbitz pull this off? Largely by using a
better programming language.</p>
<p>Programmers tend to be divided into tribes by the languages they use.
More even than by the kinds of programs they write. And so it’s
considered bad manners to say that one language is better than another.
But no language designer can afford to believe this polite fiction. What
I have to say about programming languages may upset a lot of people, but
I think there is no better way to understand hacking.</p>
<p>Some might wonder about “What You Can’t Say“ (Chapter 3). What does
that have to do with computers? The fact is, hackers are obsessed with
free speech. Slashdot, the New York Times of hacking, has a whole
section about it. I think most Slashdot readers take this for granted.
But Plane andandandand Pilot doesn’t have a section about free
speech.</p>
<p>Why do hackers care so much about free speech? Partly, I think,
because innovation is so important in software, and innovation and
heresy are practically the same thing. Good hackers develop a habit of
questioning everything. You have to when you work on machines made of
words that are as complex as a mechanical watch and a thousand times the
size.</p>
<p>But I think that misfits and iconoclasts are also more likely to
become hackers. The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West,
where you can think anything you want, if you’re willing to risk the
consequences.</p>
<p>And this book, if I’ve done what I intended, is an intellectual
Western. I wouldn’t want you to read it in a spirit of duty, thinking,
“Well, these nerds do seem to be taking over the world. I suppose I’d
better understand what they’re doing, so I’m not blindsided by whatever
they cook up next.“ If you like ideas, this book ought to be fun. Though
hackers generally look dull on the outside, the insides of their heads
are surprisingly interesting places.</p>
