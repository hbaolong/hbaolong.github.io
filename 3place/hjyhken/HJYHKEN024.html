<ul>
<li>glossary,英 [ˈɡlɒsəri] 美 [ˈɡlɑːsəri]
n. 词汇表，术语表；专门词典</li>
</ul>
<p>abstract</p>
<p>Hiding details. When a language is more abstract, you can write
programs using a smaller number of (individually more powerful)
operations.</p>
<p>Ada</p>
<p>An object-oriented language designed by a committee for the DoD in
the late 1970s. Turned out about like you would expect.</p>
<p>AI, artificial intelligence</p>
<p>A general term for several kinds of work that attempt to make
machines think. The more mathematical have had some success (e.g. in
computer vision).</p>
<p>Algol</p>
<p>A programming language initially designed in 1958 by a committee
(bad) of very smart (good) people. Rarely used to write programs, but
had a great influence on succeeding languages.</p>
<p>algorithm</p>
<p>A method for doing something. Recipes are examples of algorithms.</p>
<p>alphanumeric characters</p>
<p>Letters and digits.</p>
<p>API</p>
<p>Application Program Interface. The list of commands an operating
system or library will accept from applications.</p>
<p>APL</p>
<p>An extremely succinct language designed in the early 1960s by Ken
Iverson. Used especially in numerical applications. Its modern
descendant is J.</p>
<p>application</p>
<p>A program that is not infrastructure. E.g. a word processor, but not
an operating system. Not a precise term.</p>
<p>Arc</p>
<p>A vaporware Lisp dialect.</p>
<p>array</p>
<p>What in school you called a matrix: an n-dimensional collection of
numbered pigeonholes for storing data.</p>
<p>ASP</p>
<p>Application Service Provider. A company that lets you use software on
their computers via a network, as opposed to installing and running the
software on your own computer.</p>
<p>assembly language</p>
<p>A more programmer-friendly form of machine language. The commands are
the same but you can use more convenient names.</p>
<p>BandandandandD language</p>
<p>Bondage andandandand discipline language. A language that makes the
programmer follow strict rules.</p>
<p>bandwidth</p>
<p>The rate at which a connection can transmit data.</p>
<p>Bayesian</p>
<p>Using Bayes’s Rule, which says how to combine statistical
evidence.</p>
<p>binary</p>
<p>When used with an article (e.g. “a binary“), object code. When used
without an article, a way of representing numbers in base 2 instead of
the more familiar base 10. Successive digits (starting from the right)
represent powers of two instead of powers of ten. So 101, in binary,
represents the number we write as 5 in decimal. Most computers represent
data in binary, because it’s easier to design circuits with two states
(on or off) than ten.</p>
<p>bit manipulation</p>
<p>Performing simple transformations to large areas of a computer’s
memory. For example, moving a window on the screen.</p>
<p>bloatcode</p>
<p>A programmer who makes programs longer than they should be.</p>
<p>block-structured</p>
<p>Describes a language in which programs have subsidiary parts instead
of simply being a list of commands.</p>
<p>Blub Paradox</p>
<p>The inability to understand the power of programming languages more
powerful than the ones you’re used to thinking in.</p>
<p>bottom-up programming</p>
<p>A style of programming that works from the other direction than the
earlier top-down style. Instead of subdividing a task down into smaller
units, you build a “language“ of ideas up toward your task. The two
techniques can be combined.</p>
<p>bound</p>
<p>Constrained by a particular resource. E.g. I/O-bound, memory-bound,
CPU-bound.</p>
<p>branch</p>
<p>A machine language goto command.</p>
<p>Brooks’s Hypothesis</p>
<p>That the number of lines of code programmers can produce per day is
constant, regardless of the of the language they’re using.</p>
<p>bug</p>
<p>A mistake in a program. Predates computers; in the early twentieth
century it was common to speak of “ironing out the bugs“ in a Broadway
play.</p>
<p>buffer</p>
<p>A segment of memory used to hold a sequence of data the program
expects as input, or is accumulating for output.</p>
<p>buffer overflow attack</p>
<p>See Notes.</p>
<p>byte code</p>
<p>Any language like machine language, but not of any specific computer.
Because byte code is like machine language, it is easy to write a byte
code interpreter, which reads byte code programs and executes the
corresponding machine language commands.</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>A beautifully simple language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the
early 1970s. Widely used in infrastructure like operating systems and
routers.</p>
<p>C++</p>
<p>An attempt to add object-oriented capabilities to C, designed by
Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983. Popular because its syntax is like C’s, and
it can be intermixed with C programs.</p>
<p>CGI script</p>
<p>Common Gateway Interface script. A program that a web server runs
when it needs to compute something (e.g. search results) rather than
just sending you a pre-existing web page. The key limitation of CGI
scripts is that they generate only one page before terminating, rather
than remaining in memory and having an ongoing conversation with the
user, like desktop software.</p>
<p>checksum</p>
<p>A way of summing up all the information in a file to get one number
that can be used to identify it. One (not very good) way to calculate a
checksum, for example, would be to use the number of characters.</p>
<p>circular definition</p>
<p>See infinite loop.</p>
<p>class</p>
<p>In object-oriented programming, a data type.</p>
<p>click trail</p>
<p>The series of HTTP requests sent to a web server by one specific
user. Usually equates to the series of web pages they visited.</p>
<p>client</p>
<p>A computer or device that submits requests to a server.</p>
<p>Cobol</p>
<p>A primitive language designed in the early 1960s for use in business
applications. Only recently succeeded by Java as the most popular
language.</p>
<p>code</p>
<p>When unqualified, source code.</p>
<p>collocated</p>
<p>Located, especially at an ISP.</p>
<p>comment</p>
<p>Part of a program that is ignored by the computer. Usually inserted
as an annotation for human readers.</p>
<p>Common Lisp</p>
<p>A popular dialect of Lisp designed by a committee in the 1980s.</p>
<p>compiler</p>
<p>A program that translates programs written in a more powerful,
succinct language (a high-level language) into the simpler commands
(machine language) that the computer hardware understands. See also:
interpreter.</p>
<p>complexity</p>
<p>The time complexity of an algorithm is how fast the time required to
complete it grows as the size of the input grows. For example, if you
have to search a room for a specific person by looking at each in turn,
the time required to find him will be proportionate to the number of
people. Such an algorithm is called O (n), meaning it takes time
proportionate to n, the size of the data. Whereas if you wanted to find
the two people in the room who looked most like siblings, you’d probably
take time proportionate to the square of the number of people, because
you might have to compare every pair, and the number of pairs is the
square of the number of people. Such an algorithm is O (n 2).</p>
<p>conditional</p>
<p>A high-level language expression (or statement) in which different
code is executed depending on whether or not some condition is true. For
example: if it is sunny, then go for a walk, otherwise stay inside and
read.</p>
<p>content-based filtering</p>
<p>Filtering email based on what it says, rather than, for example,
where on the Internet it came from.</p>
<p>CPU</p>
<p>Central Processing Unit. The part of a computer, usually now a single
chip, where computations are carried out. The concept is growing
blurred, because there are now processors within e.g. graphics cards and
hard disks.</p>
<p>crash</p>
<p>When a bug causes an operating system or application to stop working.
Or, when applied to hard disks, a hardware malfunction.</p>
<p>cruft</p>
<p>Debris.</p>
<p>cycle</p>
<p>The minimum time required to execute a machine instruction. A
computer with a clock speed of 1 GHz has a billion cycles per second,
meaning it can execute up to a billion machine instructions per
second.</p>
<p>DARPA</p>
<p>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Has funded much of the
computer research in the United States.</p>
<p>data structure</p>
<p>A format for data with multiple parts. For example, you could use one
consisting of a pair of numbers to represent points on a graph.</p>
<p>data type</p>
<p>A category of data that a language can deal with. Typical data types
include integers (1), floating-point numbers, which in school you called
decimals (1.234), and character strings (“monster“).</p>
<p>dynamic typing</p>
<p>The opposite of static typing.</p>
<p>debugging</p>
<p>Finding and fixing mistakes in a program.</p>
<p>declaration</p>
<p>An element of a program that is more of a description than a command.
The most common are type declarations, where you say what type of values
a variable may have.</p>
<p>deprecated</p>
<p>Said of practices supported by a standard whose authors now wish they
had not allowed them.</p>
<p>design war</p>
<p>A competition where the best design wins, rather than e.g. marketing
or control of sales outlets.</p>
<p>device driver</p>
<p>Component of an operating system that knows how to talk to a specific
device, like a printer.</p>
<p>diff</p>
<p>An unselective and microscopically thorough comparison between two
versions of something. From the Unix diff utility, which compares
files.</p>
<p>embedded language</p>
<p>A language defined within another language, usually for a specific
kind of problem. For example, if you define a series of commands for
manipulating images, you can start to think of them as a language for
manipulating images. See bottom-up programming.</p>
<p>end user</p>
<p>Euphemism for unsophisticated user.</p>
<p>environment</p>
<p>Software to help in writing programs, e.g. editors and profilers.</p>
<p>expression</p>
<p>A quantum of code that when executed yields a value. E.g. the
expression 2+3 will yield 5.</p>
<p>field</p>
<p>One of the parts of a data structure.</p>
<p>file</p>
<p>A sequence of characters or binary digits, usually stored on
disk.</p>
<p>Fortran</p>
<p>A programming language widely used for numerical applications.
Originally designed by a group at IBM in 1956, it has evolved greatly
since.</p>
<p>FreeBSD</p>
<p>An open source dialect of Unix.</p>
<p>freeware</p>
<p>Software distributed for free.</p>
<p>function</p>
<p>A subroutine that, when called, yields a value, which becomes the
value of the call. In some languages, functions are a data type.</p>
<p>garbage collection</p>
<p>Recovering memory that is no longer needed by a program
automatically, instead of requiring the programmer to explicitly (and
often mistakenly) declare when he is finished using it.</p>
<p>glue program</p>
<p>A program to sequence or move data between applications.</p>
<p>goto</p>
<p>A command that transfers control to another part of a program.
Because there is no mechanism for returning to a goto, as there is to a
subroutine call, programs that use gotos tend to become spaghetti. Rare
now.</p>
<p>Greenspun’s Tenth Rule</p>
<p>“Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc
informally-specified bug-ridden slow implementation of half of Common
Lisp.“</p>
<p>hack</p>
<p>A solution that somehow breaks the rules. Can be either good or
bad.</p>
<p>hacker</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A good programmer. (2) Someone who breaks into computers.</li>
</ol>
<p>hash table</p>
<p>A data structure like a database in which you can store chunks of
data under individual keys and later retrieve the data stored under a
given key.</p>
<p>headers</p>
<p>The part at the top of an email containing information about it. The
average user sees only the From, To, Date, Subject, and Cc lines, but
there are others describing e.g. the path the email took.</p>
<p>heuristic</p>
<p>Rule of thumb.</p>
<p>high-level</p>
<p>Substantially more abstract than machine language.</p>
<p>HTML</p>
<p>HyperText Markup Language. The notation used to express web
pages.</p>
<p>HTTP</p>
<p>HyperText Transfer Protocol. The protocol that web browsers and
servers use to communicate with one another.</p>
<p>indented</p>
<p>Like an outline, source code is indented to show its structure. When
code says to do a list of things n times, for example, the list of
things is usually indented to show that it’s within a loop. In most
languages indentation is something you add to make programs easier to
read, but in some (e.g. Python) it is significant, meaning it affects
the behavior of the program.</p>
<p>infinite loop</p>
<p>See circular definition.</p>
<p>interpreter</p>
<p>Like a compiler, an interpreter accepts programs written in a
high-level language, but instead of translating the whole program into
machine language and then running that, the interpreter examines the
program one piece at a time and executes the corresponding machine
language commands.</p>
<p>inner loop</p>
<p>Part of a program that gets executed particularly often.</p>
<p>instrument</p>
<p>To modify a program to keep track of everything it does, so that if
it’s slow or uses too much memory, you can find out why.</p>
<p>Intel box</p>
<p>A computer with an Intel processor.</p>
<p>I/O</p>
<p>Input and output. Usually, printing and reading characters or binary
data.</p>
<p>IT</p>
<p>Information Technology. Computer infrastructure, or the people in
charge of maintaining it. Term used mainly in big or non technical
companies.</p>
<p>Java</p>
<p>An attempt at a better C++ by James Gosling. Originally called Oak,
it was renamed Java by Sun when they adopted it in the hope of inserting
a Sun-controlled layer between operating systems and applications. That
didn’t work, but Java is popular anyway, partly due to Sun’s huge
marketing effort, and partly because there is demand for a better
C++.</p>
<p>Javascript</p>
<p>A scripting language for web browsers designed by Brendan Eich. It
has no intrinsic connection to Java, which is in most ways inferior.
Unduly maligned because it is used mainly to do cheesy things on web
sites.</p>
<p>kludge</p>
<p>A bad hack. (Rhymes with stooge.)</p>
<p>larval startup</p>
<p>A startup in the earliest phase, when the potential founders are not
sure they want to start a company.</p>
<p>legacy software</p>
<p>Software an organization still needs, which is not written the way
they wish it were, and which they can’t afford to or don’t dare to
rewrite.</p>
<p>lexical closure</p>
<p>A function that refers to a variable defined not within it, but in
the surrounding code. The accumulator generators on Section 13.7 yield
closures.</p>
<p>LFSP</p>
<p>Language for Smart People. A language that puts power over
safety.</p>
<p>library</p>
<p>A collection of existing code for performing a specific task.</p>
<p>Linux</p>
<p>An open source dialect of Unix. Called GNU Linux by the fastidious,
because while the kernel (the innermost part) was written by Linus
Torvalds, more of the code comes from Richard Stallman’s GNU
Project.</p>
<p>Lisp</p>
<p>A family of languages deriving from one John McCarthy discovered in
the late 1950s. The two best known dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme.
Recent open source languages contain increasing amounts of Lisp DNA.</p>
<p>list</p>
<p>A series of pieces of data, often of varying types, which can be
joined together like trains to make bigger lists.</p>
<p>literal representation</p>
<p>A way of referring directly to data in a high-level language. In most
languages, the literal representation of five is 5. (The expression 2+3
has the same value, but is not a literal representation.)</p>
<p>low-level</p>
<p>Less abstract; allowing only simple commands, like machine
language.</p>
<p>machine instruction</p>
<p>One machine language command.</p>
<p>machine language</p>
<p>The list of commands a processor knows how to obey. Also, a sequence
of such commands.</p>
<p>macro</p>
<p>A program that generates programs. The means for doing this vary
between languages, so a “macro“ in one language may mean something much
more powerful than in another.</p>
<p>mainframe</p>
<p>A big computer based on designs from the 1960s and 70s.</p>
<p>math envy</p>
<p>The worry that one is not as smart as mathematicians, especially when
manifested in work with a gratuitously mathematical flavor.</p>
<p>metacircular</p>
<p>When the interpreter of a language is written in that language. More
a technique for describing languages than implementing them.</p>
<p>method</p>
<p>In object-oriented programming, a subroutine considered as a property
of some class of things. For example, the area method of the circle
class might be a subroutine for calculating the areas of circles.</p>
<p>module</p>
<p>A group of subroutines and variables considered as a unit. Generally
only specifically noted ones are accessible to code outside the
module.</p>
<p>Moore’s Law</p>
<p>The official version of Moore’s Lawis that the number of transistors
on a chip doubles every two years. But most people use the term to mean
that processors get twice as fast every 18 months. Arguably more
business plan than law, because Gordon Moore was a founder of Intel.</p>
<p>number crunching</p>
<p>Performing straightforward operations on large amounts of numerical
data.</p>
<p>object</p>
<p>A term with many meanings. In the most general sense, an instance of
a data type. E.g. a particular string, or a particular integer.</p>
<p>object code</p>
<p>Machine language, as the output of a compiler.</p>
<p>OO, object-oriented</p>
<p>A way of organizing programs so that the code for performing a
certain task on different classes of data is broken up into separate
pieces (methods) for each. See Section 10.7.</p>
<p>Occam’s Razor</p>
<p>That one should prefer the simpler of two theories.</p>
<p>open source</p>
<p>Software whose source code is freely distributed and can be modified
by anyone, usually on the condition that the modifications also be made
freely available. Linux and FreeBSD are well-known open source operating
systems.</p>
<p>orthogonal</p>
<p>Independent of one another and therefore combinable in many ways.
Classic Lego is more orthogonal than a plastic model kit.</p>
<p>OS, operating system</p>
<p>The program that controls the running of other programs. Unix,
FreeBSD, Linux, OSX, and the Windows family are operating systems.</p>
<p>optimization</p>
<p>Changing a program to make it more efficient.</p>
<p>parallel computer</p>
<p>A computer whose hardware can perform multiple computations
simultaneously. Not a sharply delineated category, because all modern

the square or cube of x. The resulting curve gets steeper over time.</p>
<p>portable</p>
<p>Able to be moved to new hardware. Programs written in high-level

<p>A program that watches your program while it’s running and tells you
which parts consume most resources. See inner loop.</p>
<p>pseudocode</p>
<p>A language for expressing algorithms “on paper“ rather than to
computers. Arguably, this whole concept is an artifact of using

<p>An open source language developed by Guido van Rossum. Strongly
object-oriented in flavor, it is seen by fans as a cleaner alternative
to Perl.</p>
<p>QA</p>
<p>Quality Assurance. In software, people who detect and catalog
bugs.</p>
<p>recursive</p>

Yukihiro “matz“ Matsumoto.</p>
<p>scan</p>
<p>To look at a series of characters and divide it up into tokens.</p>
<p>Scheme</p>
<p>An elegant but prim dialect of Lisp designed by Guy Steele and Gerry
Sussman in 1975.</p>

usage is meaningless.</p>
<p>server</p>
<p>A computer on a net work that responds to requests from other
computers.</p>
<p>SETI@home</p>

<p>A theoretical machine that can be in some set of possible states,
with connections between states when certain conditions are true.</p>
<p>statement</p>
<p>A quantum of code that does not yield a value. To be any use it must
thus have some effect, e.g. print something. Arguably, this whole
concept is a mistake; in some languages there are only expressions.</p>
<p>static typing</p>
<p>A language is statically typed if the type of value that every
variable can have has to be known at the time the program is
written.</p>
<p>string</p>
<p>A sequence of characters, usually denoted “like this“.</p>
<p>subroutine</p>
<p>A distinct chunk of code. When at some point in a program you want to
run this code, you call it, and when the subroutine is finished, control
returns to the point where the call occurred. In a cookbook, a recipe
for making icing might be a subroutine of a cake recipe, and the call
might be “make icing using the recipe on page x.“</p>

<p>symbol</p>
<p>A data type whose instances are tokens. Like strings except (a) a
symbol is a single unit, not a sequence of characters, and (b) there is
generally only one symbol with a given name, whereas there might be
several strings containing the same characters.</p>
<p>syntax</p>
<p>The form used to express the ideas in a program. To give x the value
10, different languages might say x=10, x&lt;-10,or (=x 10).</p>
<p>system administrator</p>
<p>Someone who installs computer hardware and software and keeps
networks running properly.</p>
<p>system administrator disease</p>
<p>The implicit belief by system administrators that the infrastructure
they oversee is an end in itself, rather than a tool there for users.
More generally, the attitude that customers are a nuisance, rather than
the reason your job exists. Endemic in jobs not exposed to
competition.</p>
<p>throwaway program</p>
<p>A program written to satisfy some temporary need.</p>
<p>token</p>
<p>A sequence of characters as one unit. A more general term for
“word.“</p>

conversation with the language, as you do with Unix, rather than simply
compiling programs and then running them.</p>
<p>tree</p>
<p>A data structure each instance of which can refer to two or more
other instances. For example, a family tree.</p>
<p>Turing-complete</p>
<p>A language is Turing-complete if any program written in it can be
translated into a Turing machine program and vice versa. All programming
languages are Turing-complete, meaning they are all (in a theoretical
sense) equivalent in power. Aka Turing-equivalent.</p>
<p>Turing machine</p>
<p>A simple imaginary computer whose properties are used to prove
theorems about computation. It is currently believed that you can’t get
anything more powerful, in the sense that you can’t define a computer
whose programs couldn’t be translated into Turing machine programs. But
no one can say for sure, because “computer“ isn’t formally defined.</p>

<p>Data type.</p>
<p>UDP</p>
<p>A protocol for broadcasting information on networks.</p>
<p>UI</p>
<p>User Interface.</p>
<p>Unix</p>
<p>The operating system from which most current ones derive. The term is
used both generically and is a trademark of a company that ended up with
the rights to an early variant. Originally developed at Bell Labs by Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>vector</p>
<p>A one dimensional array; a sequence.</p>
<p>uptime</p>
<p>Percentage of time a computer, particularly a server, is doing what
it is supposed to. Also, the time since a computer last crashed.</p>
<p>URL</p>
<p>Uniform Resource Locator. The address of a web page. More precisely,
a request to a web server, usually for a web page, but possibly to run a
program (e.g. a web search).</p>
<p>vaporware</p>
<p>Software that is talked about but not yet available.</p>
<p>VC, venture capitalist</p>
<p>One who supplies money to start or refinance a company in return for
some of the stock.</p>

<p>The very first version of something, with the implication that it
will be incomplete or broken.</p>
<p>VT100</p>
<p>A popular computer terminal in the 1980s.</p>

<p>A server that responds to HTTP requests.</p>
<p>wedged</p>
<p>In an unresponsive state. Said especially of servers.</p>
<p>wysiwyg</p>

processor where what you see on the screen looks like the page that will
come out of your printer.</p>
