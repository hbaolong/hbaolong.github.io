<h4 id="chapter-4.-good-bad-attitude">Chapter 4. Good Bad Attitude</h4>
<p>To the popular press, “hacker“ means someone who breaks into
computers. Among programmers it means a good programmer. But the two
meanings are connected. To programmers, “hacker“ connotes mastery in the
most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he
wants—whether the computer wants to or not.</p>
<p>To add to the confusion, the noun “hack“ also has two senses. It can
be either a compliment or an insult. It’s called a hack when you do
something in an ugly way. But when you do something so clever that you
somehow beat the system, that’s also called a hack. The word is used
more often in the former than the latter sense, probably because ugly
solutions are more common than brilliant ones.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the two senses of “hack“ are also connected. Ugly
and imaginative solutions have something in common: they both break the
rules. And there is a gradual continuum between rule breaking that’s
merely ugly (using duct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule
breaking that is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean
space).</p>
<p>Hacking predates computers. When he was working on the Manhattan
Project, Richard Feynman used to amuse himself by breaking into safes
containing secret documents. This tradition continues today. When we
were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too much time
around MIT had his own lock picking kit.1 (He now runs a hedge fund, a
not unrelated enterprise.)</p>
<p>It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would want to
do such things. Another friend of mine once got in trouble with the
government for breaking into computers. This had only recently been
declared a crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative
technique didn’t work. Police investigation apparently begins with a
motive. The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex, revenge.
Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on the FBI’s list.
Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to them.</p>
<p>Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers’ general attitude of
disobedience. But that disobedience is a byproduct of the qualities that
make them good programmers. They may laugh at the CEO when he talks in
generic corporate new speech, but they also laugh at someone who tells
them a certain problem can’t be solved. Suppress one, and you suppress
the other.</p>
<p>This attitude is sometimes affected. Sometimes young programmers
notice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to adopt some of
their own in order to seem smarter. The fake version is not merely
annoying; the prickly attitude of these posers can actually slow the
process of innovation.</p>
<p>But even factoring in their annoying eccentricities, the disobedient
attitude of hackers is a net win. I wish its advantages were better
understood.</p>
<p>For example, I suspect people in Hollywood are simply mystified by
hackers’ attitudes toward copyrights. They are a perennial topic of
heated discussion on Slashdot. But why should people who program
computers be so concerned about copyrights, of all things?</p>
<p>Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent copying. Show
any hacker a lock and his first thought is how to pick it. But there is
a deeper reason that hackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and
patents. They see increasingly aggressive measures to protect
“intellectual property“ as a threat to the intellectual freedom they
need to do their job. And they are right.</p>
<p>It is by poking about inside current technology that hackers get
ideas for the next generation. No thanks, intellectual homeowners may
say, we don’t need any outside help. But they’re wrong. The next
generation of computer technology has often—perhaps more often than
not—been developed by outsiders. In 1977 there was no doubt some group
within IBM developing what they expected to be the next generation of
business computer. They were mistaken. The next generation of business
computer was being developed on entirely different lines by two
long-haired guys called Steve in a garage in Los Altos. At about the
same time, the powers that be were cooperating to develop the official
next generation operating system, Multics. But two guys who thought
Multics excessively complex went off and wrote their own. They gave it a
name that was a joking reference to Multics: Unix.</p>
<p>Figure 4-1. Jobs and Wozniak with a circumvention device, 1975.</p>
<p>The latest intellectual property laws impose unprecedented
restrictions on the sort of poking around that leads to new ideas. In
the past, a competitor might use patents to prevent you from selling a
copy of something they made, but they couldn’t prevent you from taking
one apart to see how it worked. The latest laws make this a crime. How
are we to develop new technology if we can’t study current technology to
figure out how to improve it?</p>
<p>Ironically, hackers have brought this on themselves. Computers are
responsible for the problem. The control systems inside machines used to
be physical: gears and levers and cams. Increasingly, the brains (and
thus the value) of products is in software.2 And by this I mean software
in the general sense: i.e. data. A song on an LP is physically stamped
into the plastic. A song on an iPod’s disk is merely stored on it.</p>
<p>Data is by definition easy to copy. And the Internet makes copies
easy to distribute. So it is no wonder companies are afraid. But, as so
often happens, fear has clouded their judgement. The government has
responded with draconian laws to protect intellectual property. They
probably mean well. But they may not realize that such laws will do more
harm than good.</p>
<p>Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws? If I were a
legislator, I’d be interested in this mystery—for the same reason that,
if I were a farmer and suddenly heard a lot of squawking coming from my
hen house one night, I’d want to go out and investigate. Hackers are not
stupid, and unanimity is very rare in this world. So if they’re all
squawking, perhaps there is something amiss.</p>
<p>Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America, will
actually harm it? Think about it. There is something very American about
Feynman breaking into safes during the Manhattan Project. It’s hard to
imagine the authorities having a sense of humor about such things over
in Germany at that time. Maybe it’s not a coincidence.</p>
<p>Hackers are unruly. That is the essence of hacking. And it is also
the essence of American-ness. It is no accident that Silicon Valley is
in America, and not France, or Germany, or England, or Japan. In those
countries, people color inside the lines.</p>
<p>I lived for a while in Florence. But after I’d been there a few
months I realized that what I’d been unconsciously hoping to find there
was back in the place I’d just left. The reason Florence is famous is
that in 1450, it was New York. In 1450 it was filled with the kind of
turbulent and ambitious people you find now in America. (So I went back
to America.)</p>
<p>It is greatly to America’s advantage that it is a congenial
atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness—that it is a home not just
for the smart, but for smart-alecks. And hackers are invariably
smart-alecks. If we had a national holiday, it would be April 1st. It
says a great deal about our work that we use the same word for a
brilliant or a horribly cheesy solution. When we cook one up we’re not
always 100% sure which kind it is. But as long as it has the right sort
of wrongness, that’s a promising sign. It’s odd that people think of
programming as precise and methodical. Computers are precise and
methodical. Hacking is something you do with a gleeful laugh.</p>
<p>In our world some of the most characteristic solutions are not far
removed from practical jokes. IBM was no doubt rather surprised by the
consequences of the licensing deal for DOS, just as the hypothetical
“adversary“ must be when Michael Rabin solves a problem by redefining it
as one that’s easier to solve.</p>
<p>Smart-alecks have to develop a keen sense of how much they can get
away with. And lately hackers have sensed a change in the atmosphere.
Lately hackerliness seems rather frowned upon.</p>
<p>To hackers the recent contraction in civil liberties seems especially
ominous. That must also mystify outsiders. Why should we care especially
about civil liberties? Why programmers, more than dentists or salesmen
or landscapers?</p>
<p>Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate.
Civil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaint American
tradition. Civil liberties make countries rich. If you made a graph of
GNP per capita vs. civil liberties, you’d notice a definite trend. Could
civil liberties really be a cause, rather than just an effect? I think
so. I think a society in which people can do and say what they want will
also tend to be one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather
than those sponsored by the most influential people. Authoritarian
countries become corrupt; corrupt countries become poor; and poor
countries are weak. It seems to me there is a Laffer curve for
government power, just as for tax revenues. 3 At least, it seems likely
enough that it would be stupid to try the experiment and find out.
Unlike high tax rates, you can’t repeal totalitarianism if it turns out
to be a mistake.</p>
<p>This is why hackers worry. The government spying on people doesn’t
literally make programmers write worse code. It just leads eventually to
a world in which bad ideas will win. And because this is so important to
hackers, they’re especially sensitive to it. They can sense
totalitarianism approaching from a distance, as animals can sense an
approaching thunderstorm.</p>
<p>It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures intended to
protect national security and intellectual property turned out to be a
missile aimed right at what makes America successful. But it would not
be the first time that measures taken in an atmosphere of panic had the
opposite of the intended effect.</p>
<p>There is such a thing as American-ness. There’s nothing like living
abroad to teach you that. And if you want to know whether something will
nurture or squash this quality, it would be hard to find a better focus
group than hackers, because they come closest of any group I know to
embodying it. Closer, probably, than the men running our government, who
for all their talk of patriotism remind me more of Richelieu or Mazarin
than Thomas Jefferson or George Washington.</p>
<p>When you read what the founding fathers had to say for themselves,
they sound more like hackers. “The spirit of resistance to government,“
Jefferson wrote, “is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish it
always to be kept alive.“</p>
<p>Imagine an American president saying that today. Like the remarks of
an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of the the founding fathers
have embarrassed generations of their less confident successors. They
remind us where we come from. They remind us that it is the people who
break rules that are the source of America’s wealth and power.</p>
<p>Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be obeyed.
But be careful what you ask for. You might get it.</p>
