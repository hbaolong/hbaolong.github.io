<h4 id="the-practice-of-skills">1. THE PRACTICE OF SKILLS</h4>
<p>THE exact sciences are a set of formulae which have a bearing on
experience. We have seen that in accrediting this bearing, we must rely
to varying degrees on our powers of personal knowing. I shall now try to
elucidate the structure of such personal acts further, by analysing the
forces engaged in them. Science is operated by the skill of the
scientist and it is through the exercise of his skill that he shapes his
scientific knowledge. We may grasp, therefore, the nature of the
scientist’s personal participation by examining the structure of
skills.</p>
<p>I shall take as my clue for this investigation the well-known fact
that the aim of a skilful performance is achieved by the observance of a
set of rules which are not known as such to the person following them.
For example, the decisive factor by which the swimmer keeps himself
afloat is the manner by which he regulates his respiration; he keeps his
buoyancy at an increased level by refraining from emptying his lungs
when breathing out and by inflating them more than usual when breathing
in: yet this is not generally known to swimmers. A well-known scientist,
who in his youth had to support himself by giving swimming lessons, told
me how puzzled he was when he tried to discover what made him swim;
whatever he tried to do in the water, he always kept afloat.</p>
<p>Again, from my interrogations of physicists, engineers and bicycle
manufacturers, I have come to the conclusion that the principle by which
the cyclist keeps his balance is not generally known. The rule observed
by the cyclist is this. When he starts falling to the right he turns the
handlebars to the right, so that the course of the bicycle is deflected
along a curve towards the right. This results in a centrifugal force
pushing the cyclist to the left and offsets the gravitational force
dragging him down to the right. This manœuvre presently throws the
cyclist out of balance to the left, which he counteracts by turning the
handlebars to the left; and so he continues to keep himself in balance
by winding along a series of appropriate curvatures. A simple analysis
shows that for a given angle of unbalance the curvature of each winding
is inversely proportional to the square of the speed at which the
cyclist is proceeding.</p>
<p>But does this tell us exactly how to ride a bicycle? No. You
obviously cannot adjust the curvature of your bicycle’s path in
proportion to the ratio of your unbalance over the square of your speed;
and if you could you would fall off the machine, for there are a number
of other factors to be taken into account in practice which are left out
in the formulation of this rule. Rules of art can be useful, but they do
not determine the practice of an art; they are maxims, which can serve
as a guide to an art only if they can be integrated into the practical
knowledge of the art. They cannot replace this knowledge.</p>
