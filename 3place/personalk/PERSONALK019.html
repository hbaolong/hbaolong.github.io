<h4 id="destructive-analysis">2. DESTRUCTIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
<p>The fact that skills cannot be fully accounted for in terms of their
particulars may lead to serious difficulties in judging whether or not a
skilful performance is genuine. The extensive controversy on the ‘touch’
of pianists may serve as an example. Musicians regard it as a glaringly
obvious fact that the sounding of a note on the piano can be done in
different ways, depending on the ‘touch’ of the pianist. To acquire the
right touch is the endeavour of every learner, and the mature artist
counts its possession among his chief accomplishments. A pianist’s touch
is prized alike by the public and by his pupils: it has a great value in
money. Yet when the process of sounding a note on the piano is analysed,
it appears difficult to account for the existence of ‘touch’. When a key
is depressed, a hammer is set in motion which hits a string. The hammer
is pushed by the depressed key only for a short distance and is thereby
flung into free motion, which is eventually stopped by the chord.
Therefore, it is argued, the effect of the hammer on the chord is fully
determined by the speed of the hammer in free motion at the moment when
it hits the chord. As this speed varies, the note of the chord will
sound more or less loudly. This may be accompanied by changes in colour,
etc., owing to concurrent changes in the composition of overtones, but
it should make no difference in what manner the hammer acquired any
particular speed. Accordingly, there could be no difference as between
tyro and virtuoso in the tone of the notes which they strike on a given
piano; one of the most valued qualities of the pianist’s performance
would be utterly discredited. Such is indeed the conclusion you find in
standard textbooks like Jeans’ Science and Music (1937) and A. Wood’s
Physics of Music (1944). Yet this result relies erroneously on an
incomplete analysis of the pianist’s skill. This has been demonstrated
(to my satisfaction) by J. Baron and J. Hollo, who called attention to
the noise that the depression of a key makes when all chords are removed
from a piano.1 This noise can be varied while the speed imparted to the
hammer remains unaltered. The noise mingles with the note sounded by the
hammer on the chord and modifies its quality, and this seems to account
in principle for the pianist’s capacity to control the tone of the piano
by the art of his touch.</p>
<p>This example should stand for many others which teach the same
lesson; namely that to deny the feasibility of something that is alleged
to have been done or the possibility of an event that is supposed to
have been observed, merely because we cannot understand in terms of our
hitherto accepted framework how it could have been done or could have
happened, may often result in explaining away quite genuine practices or
experiences. Yet this method of criticism is indispensable, and without
its constant exercise no scientist or technician could keep a steady
course among the many spurious observations which he has to set aside
unexplained every day.</p>
<p>Destructive analysis remains also an indispensable weapon against
superstition and specious practices. Take for example homeopathy. In
this case the efficacity of an alleged art, still widely practised
today, can be wholly refuted, in my opinion, by a mere analysis of its
claims. Medicinal substances used homeopathically can be shown, on the
evidence of homeopathic prescriptions, to be diluted to concentrations
as low as, or below that, in which they are present in ordinary food and
drinking water; it seems impossible that an additional spoonful of them
administered in a similar dilution would be medically effective.</p>
<p>A desperate situation may arise if a new skill, the efficacy of which
is open to doubt, is given a false interpretation by its discoverers.
This is illustrated by the tragic failures of the pioneers of hypnotism
during the century from Mesmer to Braid. The critics of Mesmer and later
of Elliotson found it easy to demonstrate that the manipulations which
these men said they were performing were in themselves ineffectual.
Elliotson had expounded a whole system of laws governing the alleged
transmission of animal magnetism. He claimed that the magnetism of a
glass of water, the drinking of which caused cataleptic trance, could be
graded by dipping one finger into it, or two fingers, or the whole hand.
Another ‘law’ declared that mucous surfaces of the subject, like those
of the tongue or the eyeball, were capable of receiving a greater
mesmeric stimulus than the skin. Later Elliotson announced that gold and
nickel were more sensitive to mesmeric influences than base metals like
lead. All this was nonsense and was easily proved to be nonsense. And
since the assumption had not yet dawned upon anyone that hypnotic
suggestion was the effective agent of Mesmerism, the conclusion seemed
inevitable that Elliotson’s subjects were impostors, who were either
deluding him or colluding with him.2 In vain did Elliotson bitterly
appeal: ’I have given details of 76 painless operations in the name of
common sense and humanity, what more is wanted?’3 Not until the concept
of hypnosis was established as a framework for the facts, could these
facts be eventually admitted to be true. Indeed, whenever truth and
error are amalgamated in a coherent system of conceptions, the
destructive analysis of the system can lead to correct conclusions only
when supplemented by new discoveries. But there exists no rule for
making fresh discoveries or inventing truer conceptions, and hence there
can be no rule, either, for avoiding the uncertainty of destructive
analysis.</p>
<p>A process similar to that of the critique of Mesmerism, but without
its obvious miscarriages, has been continuously fostered during the past
decades by technical research laboratories. Great industries, like the
tanneries, the potteries or steel mills, like the breweries and the
whole range of textile manufactures, as well as agriculture in its
numberless branches, have realized in these days that they were carrying
on their activities in the manner of an art without any clear knowledge
of the constituent detailed operations. When modern scientific research
was applied to these traditional industries it was faced in the first
place with the task of discovering what actually was going on there and
how it was that it produced the goods. This situation was penetratingly
recognized from the start as early as 1920 by W. L. Balls for the
scientific study of cotton spinning.4 The hitherto accepted practice of
spinning Balls described as ‘a thing in itself, scarcely related to
physical knowledge at all’, so that ‘most of the initial decade’s work
on the part of the scientist will have to be spent merely in defining
what the spinner knows’. This prediction was confirmed to me by Dr. F.
C. Toy, then Director of the Shirley Institute, the world’s leading
cotton research laboratory.5 The attempt to analyse scientifically the
established industrial arts has everywhere led to similar results.
Indeed even in the modern industries the indefinable knowledge is still
an essential part of technology. I have myself watched in Hungary a new,
imported machine for blowing electric lamp bulbs, the exact counterpart
of which was operating successfully in Germany, failing for a whole year
to produce a single flawless bulb.</p>
