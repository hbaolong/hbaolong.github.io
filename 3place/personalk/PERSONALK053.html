<h4 id="communication">2. COMMUNICATION</h4>
<p>In my chapter on Articulation I have restricted myself to the
intellectual advantages which a solitary individual may conceivably
derive from the use of language. This restriction will now be abandoned
and with it also the restriction to the declaratory mode and descriptive
use of language.</p>
<p>My argument has, of course, repeatedly overflowed already from the
descriptive to the interactive and expressive uses of language. The
affirmation of a scientific theory was seen to convey an appreciation of
its beauty and all the statements of mathematics were seen to carry a
whole gamut of delicate aesthetic appreciations. And again, the
operational principles of technology and the formal demonstrations of
mathematics were seen to be rules of a successful action which could be
most appositely cast in the imperative form, even though they were being
considered so far only in their solitary use.</p>
<p>The expressive and imperative components of descriptive language
become more marked when declarations of fact are used for purposes of
interpersonal communication. Communication is a form of address, calling
someone’s attention to its message and to its speaker. Yet the
possibility of communicating information to others is already
foreshadowed in the mere descriptive powers of language. A small set of
consistently used symbols which, owing to their peculiar manageability,
enable us to think about their subject matter more swiftly in terms of
its symbolic representation, can be used to carry information to other
people if they can use this representation as we do. This can happen
only if speakers and listeners have heard the terms used in similar
circumstances, and have derived from these experiences the same relation
between the symbols and the recurrent features (or functions) which they
represent. Both speakers and listeners must also have found the symbols
in question manageable, as otherwise they could not have acquired any
fluency in their use.</p>
<p>I believe that even though people may conceivably misunderstand any
particular words addressed to them, they can, as a rule, convey
information to each other reliably enough by speech. For I think that
the tacit judgments involved in the process of denotation do tend to
coincide between different people and that different people also tend to
find the same set of symbols manageable for the purpose of skilfully
reorganizing their knowledge.1 Let me develop this belief now in a wider
context.</p>
<p>The interpersonal coincidence of tacit judgments is primordially
continuous with the mute interaction of powerful emotions. The sexual
embrace wordlessly communicates an intense mutual satisfaction. Animals
which rear their young establish between parent and offspring a mutual
satisfaction, coloured by dominance and submission. A baby smiles back
at a smiling adult and is frightened into crying by a frowning
countenance, without any practical experience of their corresponding
dispositions.2 Judging by Piaget’s observation, the companionship of
children in play is so close, that they insufficiently realize the
distinction between themselves and their playmates. They react in an
‘autistic’ manner, which may appear selfless or egocentric, depending on
whether one regards them as losing themselves or as appropriating the
person of the others. The conviviality of gregarious animals, of which I
shall speak later, seems akin to this.</p>
<p>Diffuse emotional conviviality merges imperceptibly into the
transmission of specific experiences in the kind of physical sympathy
which overcomes the onlooker at the sight of another’s sharp suffering.
One has specially to train oneself in order to stand the sight of a
surgical operation. Even experienced doctors may faint or get sick at
the sight of a deep incision in the eye of a patient. Sadism is the
transmutation of transmitted pangs into pleasurable excitement; it is a
masochistic sharing of another man’s torment and is known to be
associated with masochism in the subject. Even the most determined
criminals are liable to be effected by physical compassion. It is on
record that when the head of the Gestapo, Himmler, desiring to test the
technique of extermination at first hand, ordered the killing of a
hundred Jews in his presence, he came near to fainting at the sight. In
spite of deliberate training to merciless cruelty, upheld by a firm
conviction of its rightness, the horrible sight of their deeds proved a
serious difficulty to the persons charged with mass exterminations and
it was in order to reduce this ‘seelische Belastung’, that the gas
chamber method was eventually adopted.3</p>
<p>Knowledge (as distinct from a single experience) is transmitted on a
primordial level from one generation of animals to the next by an
imitative process which students of animal behaviour call mimesis.4 But
communication at this level is not readily distinguishable from the
actions determined by the inheritance of instincts. A true transmission
of knowledge stemming from conviviality takes place when an animal
shares in the intelligent effort which another animal is making in its
presence. There are telling photographs by W. Köhler of chimpanzees
watching a fellow animal’s attempt to perform a difficult feat and
revealing by their gestures that they participate in another’s efforts.
Such interpersonal transmission seems at work whenever animals learn
something by example, which they obviously do when a trick invented by a
more intelligent chimpanzee is immediately taken up by another, who
would never have been able to think of it on his own. Köhler, giving
instances of this process, convincingly asserts that it is no blind
parrot-like imitation, but a genuine transmission of an intellectual
performance from one animal to another: a real communication of
knowledge on the inarticulate level.5</p>
<p>All arts are learned by intelligently imitating the way they are
practised by other persons in whom the learner places his confidence. To
know a language is an art, carried on by tacit judgments and the
practice of unspeciliable skills. The child’s way of learning to speak
from his adult guardians is therefore akin to the young mammal’s and
young bird’s mimetic responses to its nurturing, protecting and guiding
seniors. The tacit coefficients of speech are transmitted by
inarticulate communications, passing from an authoritative person to a
trusting pupil, and the power of speech to convey communication depends
on the effectiveness of this mimetic transmission.</p>
<p>Spoken communication is the successful application by two persons of
the linguistic knowledge and skill acquired by such apprenticeship, one
person wishing to transmit, the other to receive, information. Relying
on what each has learnt, the speaker confidently utters words and the
listener confidently interprets them, while they mutually rely on each
other’s correct use and understanding of these words. A true
communication will take place if, and only if, these combined
assumptions of authority and trust are in fact justified.</p>
<p>We become aware of the precariousness of these conditions when they
are grossly unfulfilled, as in the conversation of children, who, as
Piaget says, ‘fail to understand one another . . . because they think
that they do understand one another’;6 while at the same time ‘the words
spoken are not thought of from the point of view of the person spoken
to, and the latter . . . selects them according to his own interest, and
distorts them in favour of previously formed conceptions’.7 As writers,
speakers and listeners, we know the perils of such vagaries and are
constantly on the alert against them. Speaking and writing is an ever
renewed struggle to be both apposite and intelligible, and every word
that is finally uttered is a confession of our incapacity to do better;
but each time we have finished saying something and let it stand, we
tacitly imply also that this says what we mean and should mean it
therefore also to the listener or reader. Though these ubiquitous tacit
endorsements of our words may always turn out to be mistaken, we must
accept this risk if we are ever to say anything.</p>
