<h4 id="existential-aspects-of-commitment">8. EXISTENTIAL ASPECTS OF
COMMITMENT</h4>
<p>The enactment of commitment consists in self-compulsion with
universal intent through the interaction of two levels: a higher self,
which claims to be more judicious, taking control over a less judicious
lower self. Selfreliance, which supports us to meet the indeterminate
contingencies of commitment, has a similar structure; it makes us ready
to suppress a routine operation of the mind in favour of a novel
impulse. Self-compulsion and self-reliance both issue in acts of assent
by which we definitively dispose of ourselves. The change may be large
or small: a comprehensive conversion, or no more than a slight
modification of our interpretative framework. The depth of the cognitive
commitment may be measured in either case by the ensuing change of our
outlook.</p>
<p>The hazards of such existential changes cannot be probed or
delimited. If we believe—as I do—that it is incumbent on us to take
these chances, we do so in the hope that the universe is sufficiently
intelligible to justify this undertaking. The company of great
scientists whom we acknowledge lends us courage. We draw confidence from
the splendour of a thousand minds to which we pay homage. Yet this
confidence will be cheap and vain if it keeps its eyes fixed on stories
of success—though they be the success of martyrs. For the normal outcome
of a daring commitment is failure. Or worse still, it may be the success
of a vast error; the kind of error which, like the Big Lie, is
irresistibly persuasive, since it sweeps away all existing criteria of
validity and resets them in its own support, exactly as a great truth
does when overthrowing big lies and great errors. A fiduciary philosophy
does not eliminate doubt, but (like Christianity) says that we should
hold on to what we truly believe, even when realizing the absurdly
remote chances of this enterprise, trusting the unfathomable intimations
that call upon us to do so.</p>
<p>But if an active mental process, aiming at universality, can turn out
to have been altogether mistaken, can we still say that in it the
subject has risen to the level of the personal by reaching out to
reality? Though a Zande witch doctor arguing in terms of the
poison-oracle is clearly a rational person, his rationality is
altogether deluded. His intellectual system may gain a limited
justification within a society which it supplies with a form of
leadership and the means for deciding disputes, however unjustly. But as
an interpretation of natural experience it is false.</p>
<p>To this I shall reply by distinguishing between a competent line of
thought, which may be erroneous, and mental processes that are
altogether illusory and incompetent. The latter I would class for the
moment with passive mental states, as purely subjective.13 Admittedly,
the range within which I acknowledge mental activity as competent and
beyond which I reject it as superstition, fatuity, extravagance,
madness, or mere twaddle, is determined by my own interpretative
framework. And different systems of acknowledged competence are
separated by a logical gap, across which they threaten each other by
their persuasive passions. They are contesting each other’s mental
existence.</p>
<p>Such conflicts will take place within ourselves when we hesitate at
the brink of being converted from one such system to another. This
happens on a minor scale when we discredit the irresistible testimony of
our eyes by classing something seen as an optical illusion. We see two
adjacent circular segments as different in size, and we know that even
animals see them the same way, yet we keep rejecting this universally
compelling observation on the grounds that the segments are
geometrically congruent. However, in other instances the conflict may be
decided in favour of our perceptive faculties, as when the impressionist
painters decided to accept the testimony of the eye, which sees shadows
coloured merely by contrast to their coloured neighbourhood. For some
time the public refused to recognize this manner of representation and
rejected their paintings as shocking and absurd; but after a while they
agreed to see as the impressionists saw and accepted their colouring as
correct. Or consider the change in musical sensibility resulting from
the introduction of the equal-temperament scale. It is first known to
have been used in Hamburg about 1690; and Bach used it in his
compositions for the clavichord. In 1852 Helmholtz could still write of
the ‘hellish row’ resulting from its use in organ-building; whereas
forty years later Planck, as he tells us in his autobiography,
discovered that the tempered scale was ‘positively more pleasing to the
human ear, under all circumstances, than the “natural”, untempered
scale’.14 In all such cases sense experience is found to conform to, or
deviate from, certain norms. The person himself may be conscious of such
a deficiency, and strive for a more correct experience.15</p>
<p>The case of the impressionists has numerous counterparts in the field
of appetites. Peter the Great had to force his courtiers on peril of
their lives to smoke cigars, by which he hoped to Westernize their
outlook; and many of us have to pass through a similar ordeal under
compulsion by fashion, before we acquire some new taste to which we then
become wholly addicted. In a conflict between our appetitive and our
intelligent person we may side with one side or the other. Desire and
emotion may educate our intelligence, as they do when we grow up to
sexual maturity and parenthood; and the reverse may happen when we
control and refashion our appetites in conformity to social custom. As
we identify ourselves in turn with one level of our person or another,
we feel passively subjected to the activities of the one which we do not
acknowledge for the time being. When Penfield stimulates electrically in
the brain the motion of a limb or the evocation of an image, the patient
does not feel that he is carrying out the motion or recollecting the
image.16 The same sense of passivity accompanies the splitting of
personality when a hypnotized subject carries out a post-hypnotic
injunction. From his own experience under hypnosis Bleuler has likened
post-hypnotic compulsion to the way we yield to reflex urges, like
sneezing or coughing.17 Each person within an individual may become a
liability to another and may mould it to its commitments or be moulded
by it in reverse. We may prefer to identify ourselves with the person on
the higher level, but this is not invariably the case, and our choice
between the levels is part of our ultimate commitment at any particular
moment.</p>
