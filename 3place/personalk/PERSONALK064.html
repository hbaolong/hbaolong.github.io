<h4 id="the-temptation-of-the-intellectuals">13. THE TEMPTATION OF THE
INTELLECTUALS</h4>
<p>The moral appeal of a declared contempt for moral scruples is
explained here in terms of a moral inversion. An analogous explanation
will resolve yet another paradox: the fact that Stalin’s regime was
acclaimed by eminent Western writers and painters whose very works were
condemned and suppressed by that regime. And indeed—as Czeslaw Milosz
has shown—its appeal was actually due in part to its proclaimed disgust
with modern art and literature, and to its determination to make all
cultural pursuits subservient to the state. Milosz records from his own
experience in Poland that these sentiments and policies formed part of
the temptation offered by Marxism to the Polish intellectuals.36</p>
<p>To understand this we must consider, first, that unmasking and
impregnating—the negative and positive operations of Marxism—can be
applied to every form of thought in the transition from Capitalism to
Socialism. Just as the bourgeois ideals of freedom and democracy are
unmasked, while a party-dictatorship is endowed instead with the quality
of being intrinsically free and democratic, so also bourgeois art and
literature are unmasked, and the glorification of Socialism is endowed
instead with the values of art and literature. All cultural life is
subjected to a similar transformation, which surrenders it totally to
the interests of the Socialist state at the discretion of its absolute
rulers. This process accords with the logic of inversion. But this fact
does not explain altogether why such an inversion has appealed to a
notable number of intellectuals in free countries, pursuing vocations
which totalitarianism discredits and suppresses.</p>
<p>A first clue to this enigma is suggested by the word ‘unmasking’.
Socialism was not alone in rebelling against bourgeois domination in the
nineteenth century, nor was scientism the only weapon for attacking
bourgeois ideals. Allied to these was a general alienation of the
intellectuals. The joint effects of the romantic and scientific
movements engendered a modern cultural nihilism which repudiated the
existing society as comprehensively as Marxism did. This happened when
the excessive moral aspirations of modern man were disappointed by the
normal complacency, selfishness and hypocrisy of man, and these
shortcomings were accounted for by interpreting morality as something
which people obey only if they cannot evade it. Once more—as in
Marxism—moral nihilism is the mark here of exceptionally strong moral
passions. Turgenev portrayed this in the student Bazarov, the literary
archetype of philosophic nihilism.</p>
<p>Though philosophic nihilists were radical individualists, they
naturally tended to sympathize with revolutionary movements aiming at
the total destruction of society. Even so, the fact that many of them
would go so far as to give their fervent support to totalitarian
governments hostile to their own vocation as intellectuals, still
remains to be explained. It can be understood only in its historical
setting.</p>
<p>We must acknowledge that personal nihilism has served for a century
as an inspiration to literature and philosophy, both by itself and by
provoking a reaction to itself. A loathing of bourgeois society, a
rebellious immoralism and despair, have been prevailing themes of great
fiction, poetry and philosophy on the continent of Europe since the
middle of the nineteenth century. Anti-philistinism, which bred the
modern bohemian, has also stimulated in him a fierce originality which
has renewed the fine arts by a profusion of masterpieces unsurpassed in
any previous period of history.</p>
<p>But these triumphs left their authors mortified by self-doubt. Their
hatred of the established culture had spread (as in Marxism) into an
attack on the very status of man and of human thought. Peer Gynt, at the
end of his pilgrimage of pretences, recognizes himself in the image of
an onion: leaf after leaf of self-dramatization is peeled off, leaving
nothing at the core. The bourgeois encyclopaedists Bouvard and Pécuchet
lose themselves in a labyrinth of inanities. Musil’s ‘Man Without
Properties’ has ceased to be, for he thinks about life instead of living
it. The futile regress of ‘thoughts, thoughts, about thoughts, thoughts
about thoughts about thoughts’ exhausts Sartre’s Mathieu in L’Age de
Raison; yet a totally unreflecting man like the ‘Stranger’ of Camus is
equally cut off from reality, imprisoned in his private world. The
destruction of all meaning in La Nausée is the ultimate point of this
progression.</p>
<p>We can then no longer say anything in good faith, and all rational
action becomes a lifeless banality; violence alone is still honest, but
only gratuitous violence is authentic action. Having arrived at this
stage, the modern intellectual will include himself in his nauseated
contempt for the moral and cultural futility of his time. Having
rendered the universe utterly meaningless, he himself dissolves in a
universal wasteland.</p>
<p>If the intellectual is now attacked from the flank by Marxist
unmaskers, who will lump him together with the bourgeoisie, his position
is very precarious. His own growing consciousness of living in a
spiritual desert tends to re-echo the Marxian analysis of his own art
and science as mere super-structures of a contemptible Capitalism.
Moreover, any resistance to this attack would tend to prove its justice
by forcing him into partnership with the bourgeoisie, and it would also
threaten to deprive him of that anti-bourgeois status on which his
self-respect is founded. This dilemma suffices by itself to account for
the surrender of men like Sartre, Picasso and Bernal, to a philosophy
which denied the very existence of their intellectual pursuits; the more
so, since—under the protection of their own bourgeois governments—they
could happily continue to cultivate these pursuits for the time
being.</p>
<p>And here we reach the turning point. The philosophic nihilist’s
hidden moral passions are always available for political action if this
can be based on nihilistic assumptions. He can safely indulge his moral
passions by accepting the intrinsic righteousness of an unscrupulous
revolutionary power. Injected into the engines of violence, his humane
aspirations can at last expand without danger of self-doubt and his
whole person responds joyfully to a civic home of such acid-proof
quality. At last, he is engaged, he is safe.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the artist or scientist will still find it difficult to
accept the dreary cultural aims of a Communist dictatorship as the true
fulfilment of his vocation. Yet he may try to overcome his revulsion for
reasons that are not altogether base. For he is relieved thereby from
belonging to ‘the dying culture of a rotten society’ or from not
belonging to any society. He may also feel that a subservient role in a
Communist society can be only temporary. For ultimately, the triumph of
Historic Necessity must fulfil the needs of the mind as those of the
body; and even in the meantime, often no more is demanded of him than an
occasional lip-service to the official cultural policy.</p>
<p>Besides, the temptation is great to replace the standards which the
artist has set himself, by an objective rightness immanent in historic
necessity. Such rightness will appear self-evident. For within a
dynamo-objective coupling, a power may prove its historic necessity by
the mere fact of its victory, and a cultural standard ordained by such a
power must appear inherently right. Its teachings could be doubted only
by breaking up the fundamental dynamo-objective coupling on which the
whole Communist universe rests. These teachings, therefore, offer a firm
framework to the intellectual’s yearning for objective standards safe
against self-doubt.37</p>
