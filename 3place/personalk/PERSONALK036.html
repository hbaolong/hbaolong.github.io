<h4 id="understanding-logical-operations">10. UNDERSTANDING LOGICAL
OPERATIONS</h4>
<p>When we find our bearings by aid of a map we gain an understanding of
the region represented by the map, and from this conception we can
derive an indefinite number of itineraries. We are conscious of our
mastery of the region without attending focally either to the map or to
the landmarks around us; for our knowledge of these particulars enters
subsidiarily into a conception comprising jointly both the map and the
area that it represents. We find our way about the country by
reorganizing this conception so as to reveal the particular itineraries
in which we are interested. Such a conceptual decision, not induced by
new experience, but by a new kind of interest in what we know already,
is a speculative act of a kind prefigured primordially in rats running
mazes. It is a recognition of alternative part-whole relations of the
kind achieved by learning of type C.</p>
<p>Though the conceptual reorganization in question is based on
articulation, it is itself informal. Yet it may require a mental effort
and might be said to solve a problem. If so, it is a process of
deductive inference, as it leads to a new conception wholly implied by
our original conception, yet different from it. Such deduction, being
informal, is predominantly irreversible; but it can be acknowledged as
reversible to the extent to which it follows fixed rules of procedure,
be they focally known or not.</p>
<p>The process of reorganizing a conception for drawing new inferences
from it can be formalized, by accepting as inferential operations
certain rules for manipulating the symbols representing a state of
affairs. Although such manipulations are symbolic, they denote not a
state of affairs, but the transformation of one conception of a state of
affairs into another conception of it that is implied in the first. They
evoke the conceptual transformation which they symbolize in the same way
as a descriptive term like ‘cat’ evokes the conception for which it
stands. The tacit component of a formalized process of reasoning is
broadly analogous to that of a denotation. It conveys both our
understanding of the formal manipulations, and our acceptance of them as
right.</p>
<p>It may be thought that the difficulty of understanding a formalized
chain of reasoning, as for example a mathematical proof, lies in its
unfamiliar symbolism. But a verbal sentence may be as difficult to
understand as any mathematical formula. Take the sentence constructed by
Professor Findlay71 to paraphrase verbally the result of Gödel’s (first)
theorem. It runs:</p>
<p>We cannot prove the statement which is arrived at by substituting for
the variable in the statement form ‘We cannot prove the statement which
is arrived at by substituting for the variable in the statement form Y
the name of the statement form in question’ the name of the statement
form in question.</p>
<p>When you substitute for the variable Y the name of the statement form
in question which is the text in quotes, you see that Findlay’s sentence
says of itself that it cannot be demonstrated, and that hence the
sentence is true, just as a Gödelian sentence is true if it cannot be
demonstrated.</p>
<p>Even with this explanation to aid them, most people may read
Findlay’s sentence twenty times over without making head or tail of it;
indeed, it may never convey any meaning to them, for they keep losing
track of the process of comprehension by which it would make sense.
Natural aptitude and training make all the difference in this matter.
Lord Russell, to whom I showed Findlay’s text in the summer of 1949,
took in its meaning at a glance.</p>
<p>No one can be convinced by a proof which he does not understand, and
to learn up a mathematical proof which has not convinced us adds nothing
to our knowledge of mathematics. Indeed, no teacher will be satisfied
with imparting a chain of formulae connected by formal operations as
constituting a mathematical proof, and no student of mathematics should
be satisfied with memorizing such sequences. To look at a mathematical
proof by merely verifying each consecutive step—says Poincaré—is like
watching a game of chess, noting only that each step obeys the rules of
chess. The least that is required is a grasp of the logical sequence as
a purposeful procedure: what Poincaré describes as ‘the something which
constitutes the unity of the demonstration’.72 It is this
‘something’—perhaps in the form of an outline embodying the main steps
in the proof—for which the student will grope, if baffled by a sequence
of operations which convey no sense to him, and it is again this
outline, embodying the general principle or general structure of the
mathematical proof, which will be remembered when the details of the
proof are forgotten. I can still recall the general procedure followed
in evaluating the wave equation of a hydrogen atom on which I lectured
about ten years ago, though I could no longer write down any part of the
actual demonstration; and this comprehensive recollection satisfies me
that I still understand wave mechanics, and sustains in me the
conviction of its cogency. On the other hand, though I have repeatedly
gone over all the consecutive steps in the formal proof of Gödel’s
aforementioned theorem, they have conveyed nothing to me, for I have not
been able to grasp their sequence as a whole.</p>
<p>Even among mathematicians an argument which seems entirely convincing
to one person may not even be comprehensible to another.73 Hence the
striving to remove any occasion for the exercise of personal judgment by
a strict formalization of the deductive sciences; a striving which can
now be seen to aim at defeating itself. For the meaning of a formalism
lies in our subsidiary awareness of it within a conceptual focus
sustained in terms of this formalism, and is necessarily absent
therefore in operations carried out on symbols seen quite impersonally,
as objects. This limiting case is adumbrated when the complete
formalization of a proof is attempted in mathematics: the gain in
exactitude, resulting from a stricter elimination of ambiguities, is
accompanied by a loss in clarity and intelligibility.74</p>
<p>I have suggested that the formal operation of symbols conveys the
conception of a logical entailment, even as the word ‘cat’ conveys the
conception of a cat. But while the subject-matter denoted by a
mathematical proof is less tangible than a cat, a proof does more than
denote its subject matter: it brings it about. As the second operational
principle of language is set in motion, we pass on from the making of
signs to the devising of a formal process, which first contrives what it
subsequently conveys. This contriving is guided by the specific purpose
of establishing a particular implication and compelling its acceptance.
It endorses this purpose as worthy of a great effort, and sets up
standards of economy and beauty for the manner of its achievement. We
have here a far more elaborate sequence of purposive actions than that
involved in the naming of recurrent features of experience; it is a
linguistic operation in the stricter sense of an ingenious
contrivance.</p>
