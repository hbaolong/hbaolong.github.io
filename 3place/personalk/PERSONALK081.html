<h4 id="equivalence-of-belief-and-doubt">2. EQUIVALENCE OF BELIEF AND
DOUBT</h4>
<p>We may speak of doubt in a very wide sense. A moment of hesitancy
such as may be observed in the behaviour of any animal possessing a
glimmer of intelligence, could be described as doubt. A marksman taking
aim may be in doubt until he pulls the trigger. The renewed attempts of
a poet to get a line right are filled with such hesitations.6 A measure
of such tacit doubt is present in all articulate forms of intelligence
within the act of assertion, throughout its many variants. It is the
only kind of doubt that applies to the acceptance of an articulate
framework as a dwelling place, and it controls therefore at their source
the range and manner of our mental existence. But before examining this
deeper doubt I shall deal briefly with explicit forms of doubt: that is,
the questioning of explicit statements of fact either asserted by others
or previously asserted by ourselves.</p>
<p>The first point in my critique of doubt will be to show that the
doubting of any explicit statement merely implies an attempt to deny the
belief expressed by the statement, in favour of other beliefs which are
not doubted for the time being.</p>
<p>Suppose somebody says ‘I believe p’ where p stands for ‘planets move
along elliptic orbits’, or else for ‘all men are mortal’. And I reply ‘I
doubt p’ This may be taken to mean that I contradict p, which could be
expressed by ‘I believe not-p’. Alternatively, I may be merely objecting
to the assertion of p as true, by denying that there are sufficient
grounds to choose between p or not-p. This may be expressed by saying ‘I
believe p is not proven’. We may call the first type of doubt
‘contradictory’ and the second ‘agnostic’.</p>
<p>It is immediately apparent that an expression of contradictory doubt
‘I believe not-p’ is of the same character as the affirmation ‘I believe
p’ which it calls in question. For between p and not-p there is no other
difference than that they refer to different matters of fact. ‘I believe
not-p’ could stand for the allegation that planets move along orbits
which are not elliptical.</p>
<p>The history of science offers many illustrations for the logical
equivalence of affirmation and contradiction. In mathematics a problem
may often be set for a time in the positive form and then turned round
into its opposite, namely to prove the impossibility of finding a
solution for it. The squaring of the circle and the trisection of an
angle by aid of ruler and compass were both inverted after a time in
that sense; these constructions have been proved to be impossible. In
mechanics, centuries of misplaced ingenuity having been spent on solving
the problem of perpetual motion, eventually the impossibility of
constructing such a machine was established as a fundamental law of
nature. The Second and Third Laws of Thermodynamics, the theory of
Chemical Elements, the Principles of Relativity and of Indeterminacy, as
well as the Pauli Principle, were all formulated in terms of negations.
Eddington based his whole system of nature on the assumption of a series
of impossibilities. In all these cases the difference between a positive
statement and the denial of a positive statement is merely a matter of
wording, and the acceptance and rejection of either form of allegation
are both decided by similar tests.</p>
<p>Agnostic doubt is somewhat more complex, as it is composed of two
halves of which the second is not always clearly implied. The first half
of an agnostic doubt is a contradictory doubt, which can be either
temporary or final. A temporary agnostic doubt (‘I believe p is not
proven’) leaves open the possibility that p may yet be demonstrated in
future; while in its final form (‘I believe p cannot be proven’)
agnostic doubt denies that p can ever be demonstrated. But neither of
these denials alleges, strictly speaking, anything concerning the
credibility of p, and hence they represent only a first and so far
inconclusive part of agnostic doubt.</p>
<p>There are, in fact, various instances in which the first half of
agnostic doubt is raised without prejudice to the credibility of the
affirmation that is called in doubt. Suppose we want to consider the
possibility of forming a deductive system with p as one of its axioms.
For this it would be necessary that p should be consistent with the
other axioms and independent of them; which means that neither p nor
not-p should be provable within the proposed system of axioms when set
out short of p itself. If this has been successfully demonstrated, we
are at liberty to include p as one of our axioms, or else reject it,
depending on reasons which in general will be quite independent of the
demonstration in question. Only the Gödelian sentence which affirms its
own undecidability within a given formal system emerges as true, once
its undecidability has been demonstrated. Not so otherwise. Take, for
example, the proof given by Gauss that the Fifth Postulate of Euclid
cannot be derived from his first four Postulates: it served as a
justification for considering the Fifth Postulate as optional and
replacing it by newly invented non-Euclidean alternatives.</p>
<p>Yet even though in such cases the agnostic suspension of belief in
respect to a particular statement says nothing about its credibility, it
still has a fiduciary content. It implies the acceptance of certain
beliefs concerning the possibilities of proof. Kant’s demand that, in
pure mathematics, unless we know, we must abstain from all acts of
judgment, would therefore make agnostic doubt itself untenable. For this
demand is based on affirming ‘I believe p is not proven’ or ‘not
provable’, which implies the acceptance of some not strictly indubitable
framework within which p can be said to be proven or not-proven,
provable or not-provable. Kant would of course not have recognized this
contradiction, since he held that the foundations of mathematics,
including the axioms of Euclid, were indubitable a priori; but this view
has proved to be mistaken.</p>
<p>We shall presently explore the scope of agnostic doubt further in the
natural sciences, the law courts and in religious matters.</p>
