<h4 id="administration-of-individual-culture">7. ADMINISTRATION OF
INDIVIDUAL CULTURE</h4>
<p>We shall start with the condition of thought in a free society, and
let the advancement of science serve as our principal example for the
cultivation of individual thought to which independent status is
accorded by society.</p>
<p>The organization of the scientific process is determined, in the
first place, by the fact that modern science is so vast that any single
person can properly understand only a small section of it. The Royal
Society has eight sub-committees for the election of Fellows, each of
which has a separate field of research allotted to it. One of these
fields, for example, is mathematics; but individual mathematicians are
further specialized and are competent to deal only with a small part of
mathematics. It is a rare mathematician—we are told—who fully
understands more than half a dozen out of fifty papers presented to a
mathematical congress. ’The very language in which most of the other
forty-four are presented goes clear over the head of the man who follows
the six reports nearest his own speciality.’15 Adding to this evidence
my own experience in chemistry and physics, it seems to me that the
situation may be similar for all major scientific provinces, so that any
single scientist may be competent to judge at first hand only about one
hundredth of the total current output of science.</p>
<p>Yet this group of persons—the scientists—administer jointly the
advancement and dissemination of science. They do so though the control
of university premisses, academic appointments, research grants,
scientific journals and the awarding of academic degrees which qualify
their recipients as teachers, technical or medical practitioners, and
opens to them the possibility of academic appointment. Moreover, by
controlling the advancement and dissemination of science, this same
group of persons, the scientists, actually establish the current meaning
of the term ‘science’, determine what should be accepted as science, and
establish also the current meaning of the term ‘scientist’ and decide
that they themselves and those designated by themselves as their
successors should be recognized as such. The cultivation of science by
society relies on the public acceptance of these decisions as to what
science is and who are scientists.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to take this consensus for granted when we are
partners to it. It is commonly regarded as the obvious outcome of the
fact that you could repeat and confirm any observation recorded by
science. But the affirmation of this supposed fact is actually but
another manner of expressing our adherence to the consensus in question.
For we never do repeat any appreciable part of the observations of
science. And besides, we know perfectly well that if we tried to do this
and failed (as we mostly would), we would quite rightly ascribe our
failure to our lack of skill. We should keep in mind also that even if
we could reliably repeat the facts recorded by science, this would still
not justify our acceptance of the generalizations which science bases on
these facts, and would still less warrant the anterior selection of
these particular facts as subjects of scientific observation. We should
also take into account that even the truth of a generalization does not
establish it as a part of science, since the reliability of an
affirmation is only one of the three coefficients composing the
scientific value of a statement. The consensus which accepts as science
what it declares to be science endorses the scientific value of it as
graded on the threefold scale of reliability, systematic interest, and
intrinsic interest.</p>
<p>We see, therefore, that the consensus of scientific opinion goes far
beyond an agreement concerning a common experience. It is a joint
appraisal of an intellectual domain, of which each consenting
participant can properly understand and judge only a very small
fraction. One may well wonder how such an agreement can ever be
reasonably established. I think the underlying principle is this. Each
scientist watches over an area comprising his own field and some
adjoining strips of territory, over which neighbouring specialists can
also form reliable first-hand judgments. Suppose now that work done on
the speciality of B can be reliably judged by A and C; that of C by B
and D; that of D by C and E; and so on. If then each of these groups of
neighbours agrees in respect to their standards, then the standards on
which A, B and C agree will be the same on which B, C and D agree, and
on which also C, D and E agree, and so on, throughout the whole realm of
science. This mutual adjustment of standards occurs of course along a
whole network of lines which offers a multitude of cross-checks for the
adjustments made along each separate line; and the system is amply
supplemented also by somewhat less certain judgments made by scientists
directly on professionally more distant achievements of exceptional
merit. Yet its operation continues to be based essentially on the
‘transitiveness’ of neighbouring appraisals—much as a marching column is
kept in step by each man’s keeping in step with those next to him.</p>
<p>By this consensus scientists form a continuous line—or rather a
continuous network—of critics, whose scrutiny upholds the same minimum
level of scientific value in all publications accredited by scientists.
More than that: by a similar reliance of each on his immediate neighbour
they even make sure that the distinction of scientific work above this
minimum level, and right up to the highest degrees of excellence, is
measured by equivalent standards throughout the various branches of
science. The rightness of these comparative appreciations is vital to
science, for they guide the distribution of men and subsidies between
the different lines of study, and they determine, in particular, the
crucial decisions by which recognition and assistance are granted to new
departures in science or else withheld from them. Though it is
admittedly easy to find instances in which this appreciation has proved
mistaken, or at least sadly belated, we should acknowledge that we can
speak of ‘science’ as a definite and on the whole authoritative body of
systematic knowledge only to the extent to which we believe that these
decisions are predominantly correct. Otherwise, scientific institutions
would no longer serve the advancement of science but bring about its
progressive mutilation. The title of ‘scientist’ (mutually granted to
each other by persons thereby called ‘scientists’) would then gradually
cease to carry its true meaning, and so would the word ‘science’ as used
by these persons in description of their own pursuits.</p>
<p>Let me expand this. Suppose for a moment that all scientists were
charlatans, as some certainly are; or, to make the assumption more
plausible, that they were all self-deluded like Lysenko, or else either
dishonest or forced to conform to the views of people who are themselves
either dishonest or self-deluded, as Lysenko’s followers mostly were. Or
suppose that standards of scientific reliability and significance were
generally so debased as they are even now in some parts of the world; or
going a step beyond this, that the natural sciences were replaced
altogether by the occult sciences based on cabalistic methods. There
might still exist a consensus between the various specialists
acknowledging each other as scientists, and mutually acknowledging also
the validity and significance of their respective domains of
pseudo-science, and the public might be deluded by their joint
assurances to accept what they call ‘science’ as science. But clearly,
if I knew what lay behind such a consensus, I should regard it as a
consensus of rogues and fools, deceiving both each other and their
public—the result of an accident or a conspiracy, and in either case
devoid of any true significance.</p>
<p>Of course, even a consensus on a single common experience might be
illusory, and if we accredit it, we do so on certain assumptions about
the nature of this shared experience. But the consensus which mutually
recognized scientific specialists achieve by relying on each other, and
the further consensus of the public with the agreed judgment of this
body of specialists, imply assumptions of a more far-reaching kind.
Scientists must assume that the various domains of science are so
coherent that the scientific value of work done by the several
specialists within a multitude of separate provinces is in fact
assessable by essentially similar standards; and that they (the
scientists) can and will actually so supervise each other’s assessments
across the boundaries of their particular specialities, that they may
continue safely to trust each other—even through the passage of
succeeding generations—to apply these similar standards everywhere.
Moreover, the public must share these assumptions if it is to grant
confidence—as it does—to the whole body of science, of which it hardly
knows anything at all, and to accept unseen—as we may hope it will—the
future pronouncements not only of living scientists, but even of those
of their successors to be accredited one day as scientists by the
scientific opinion of the day.</p>
<p>We have here the assumptions of a cultural ideal: the ideal of a
highly differentiated intellectual life pursued collectively; or more
precisely, of a cultural élite actively conducting such an intellectual
life within a society responsive to the intellectual passions of this
élite. The acceptance of these assumptions seals a pact of mutual
confidence within the community of scientists and seals the dedication
of society as a whole to the support of their scientific pursuits. This
dedication takes effect in the establishment of scientific institutions,
set up for the advancement of science and for its dissemination
throughout society under the authority of scientific opinion. Anyone who
integrally belongs to the society in question will share thereby its
cultural dedication and the assumptions which underlie this
dedication.</p>
<p>The contrast in which I have set this scientific consensus with the
specious coherence of a company of frauds or fools has shown that I
share the assumptions underlying this consensus. My unqualified use of
accreditive terms like ‘scientific standards’ and ‘scientific values’ in
formulating these assumptions had already implied that I subscribed to
what I was describing. I believe that tacit endorsements of this kind
are unavoidable in referring to beliefs and valuations which one shares,
and I shall return to this fact later on. Meanwhile, let me add that in
subscribing to the assumptions and passions shared by a society in the
cultivation of science I also lend—to this extent—my support to such a
society. Any sociology which accredits the beliefs on which a society is
founded forms a justification of this society. And if the writer is a
member of the society in question, his sociology is a declaration of
loyalty to it. Indeed, consistency requires that in the affirmation of
socially shared values our declarations should agree with our
participation in any social activities based on the assumed validity of
these affirmations.16 Yet it is precisely this consistency which renders
the universal intent of such declarations suspect, since it shows that
they lend support to established powers, after having been instilled in
us by the very society which they vindicate. This dilemma will
reappear—for reasons adumbrated in the previous section—even more
acutely in the realm of civic thought.</p>
<p>Let me generalize meanwhile what I have said of the cultivation of
science to the cultivation of other kinds of individual thought, though,
conforming to the plan of this book, I can again cast only a cursory
glance at these provinces of thought.</p>
<p>The administration of the humanities, the arts, or of the practice of
various religions are all entrusted, like that of science, to a chain of
authoritative specialists. The position and power of these may be
institutionally established, as it is in the churches, or it may depend
entirely on the respect in which they are held by their admirers and
followers, as is the case with poets or painters. In all these domains
there is much greater divergence of views than there is between
scientists. Most countries of the Western type include different
religious bodies. Moreover, apart from religion (but not excluding
theology), the culture of our time is predominantly a cult of
innovation. The arts, like the sciences, are most alive in the process
of renewing themselves; fame is earned in the arts, as in science, by
creativity. But artistic originality involves as a rule more
comprehensive changes of outlook than does originality in science, and
tends to produce therefore more pronounced divisions of opinion between
the innovator seeking to establish his authority, and the leaders of
previously established art. Accordingly, rival schools of thought, which
in science are infrequent and transitory, are essential to a vigorous
cultivation of modern art. And of course, even apart from this, the arts
are not, and never can become, systematically coherent after the fashion
of sciences. There can, therefore, exist no such clear division of
labour between different kinds of artists, nor such firm consensus of
opinion among them, as we have within the community of scientific
specialists.</p>
<p>A cultural élite may be publicly subsidized or dependent on private
earnings. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century scholarship and
literary pursuits were largely the occupation of wealthy people, living
on their private incomes. Today, however, few members of the cultural
élite belong to that class and intellectual life depends correspondingly
to a greater extent on the material support given to a creative minority
by the mass of non-creative citizens. This raises the question whether,
in paying for cultural pursuits, society is fulfilling an obligation to
enlarge its intellectual possessions by the standards of its creative
leaders, or is merely hiring these persons for the purpose of serving
either its own amusement or some civic interest, like the moral and
political edification of the people.</p>
<p>We can reply to this by recalling our answer to the equivalent
question in respect to the advancement of science (p. 183). No important
discovery can be made in science by anyone who does not believe that
science is important in itself, and likewise no society which has no
sense for scientific values can cultivate science successfully. The same
applies to all cultural life: a society may be said to have a cultural
life only to the extent to which it respects cultural excellence. As in
science, this appreciation can rarely be the expression of a first-hand
judgment. The humanities, the arts, the various religions, are all
extensive and highly differentiated aggregates of which no one can fully
understand and judge more than a tiny fraction. Yet each of us respects
very much larger areas of these cultural domains. I know for example
that Dante’s Divine Comedy is a great poem though I have read very
little of it, and I respect Beethoven’s genius though I am almost deaf
to music. These are genuine second-hand appreciations, formed in the
same way in which scientists appreciate the whole of science and in
which the public follows suit. Indirect appreciations of this kind are,
again, the roots through which society as a whole nurtures cultural
life. By following their chosen intellectual leaders, the non-experts
can even participate up to a point in the works of these leaders and
beyond this in the whole range of culture accredited by them.17</p>
<p>The folklore of primitive societies does not run into millions of
volumes and is not subject to continuous innovations. Hence their
cultural life does not require a legion of experts to administer it and
much of it can be shared at first hand by everybody. Popular art and
religious life is shared also in modern societies, but this is a small
part of modern culture. Therefore, a modern society which does not
accept cultural guidance from a set of authoritative individuals cuts
itself off from any culture living within its borders. Its philistinism,
deaf to original thought, renders its intellectuals homeless in their
own country.</p>
<p>In the Western type of modern society the authority of science is
firmly established through the educational system, but all other
cultural authorities have to fight for public response and also contest
their position against strong rivals. Members of the public may shift
their allegiance from one leader to his opponent; they may change from
the camp of an academician to that of some innovator, be converted to
religion or abandon their faith, drop out of any particular movement and
join another. Sanity forbids such shifts to be very frequent, and even
so their scope is limited to choices between potential leaders. They
still leave the guidance of thought to a small number of individuals,
popularly accepted and rewarded as leaders of certain recognized
cultural domains. Our society may be said to possess a single culture to
the extent to which our cultural leaders harmoniously supplement each
other; and to this extent these leaders may be said to uphold the common
intellectual standards of our society: both in their own work and by
guiding the public appreciation of culture and enjoining society to
fulfil its cultural obligations.</p>
<p>Owing to the clash between different philosophies, religious or
artistic movements, adherents of one persuasion may refuse to recognize
any intellectual merit in those of a rival persuasion, calling them
cranks, frauds or fools. People will differ accordingly also in their
use of such professional descriptions as ‘composer’, ‘poet’, ‘painter’,
‘priest’ and in that of accreditive terms like ‘expert’, ‘reputable’ or
‘distinguished’, applied to persons claiming to be composers, poets,
etc. Yet the fact that most rival leaders share the same status in a
pluralistic society demonstrates a measure of consensus in according
some intellectual merit to most of them. This implies also the
acknowledgment of a process of thought underlying all these rival
affirmations: of a process guided throughout by standards which, though
manifestly disparate, are descended from a common inheritance of values
and beliefs. This belief in an autonomous process of coherent thought is
(as in science) the fundamental condition for the social cultivation of
thought, guided by its own standards and prompted by its own
passions.</p>
