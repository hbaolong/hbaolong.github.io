<h4 id="learning-and-induction">7. LEARNING AND INDUCTION</h4>
<p>A learning experiment is a teaching experiment. We must start it by
judging the animal to be ignorant in certain respects and by trusting
that after certain experiences, for which we shall offer it an
opportunity, its behaviour will reveal that it has—or has not—acquired
the knowledge which it should properly derive from these experiences. If
we eventually come to believe that it has acquired this knowledge and
that it has acquired it by the experience in question, we shall call
this ‘learning’; while if we deny this achievement, we shall say that
the animal has failed or that our teaching was inadequate.</p>
<p>Psychologists would almost unanimously reject such a definition
today; in the first place, I think, because it is teleological. But that
this is unjustified can be shown easily, in respect of strict
behaviourism which describes its subjects as machines, and a fortiori
for other schools of psychology. A machine is defined by operational
principles which achieve an acknowledged purpose.52 That is why the
McCullough-Pitts model of the nervous system, or C. L. Hull’s robot
representing the process of learning, are machines, while the solar
system is not. And this is why psychology differs from astronomy; it
does not describe events related to no purpose, but analyses a certain
class of achievements believed to be mental. The result is a system of
rightness, which depends on certain not normative elements for its
success or failure.53</p>
<p>Since the success of learning consists in the acquisition of
knowledge, a mechanical theory of learning can be represented as the
operations of a machine drawing correct inferences from observable
facts. Such machines have been devised in principle, and their mechanism
closely resembles that which many behaviourists, following Thorndike,
have attributed to the process of learning in animals. The machine is
designed to produce a series of random responses to a given state of
affairs until it finally hits on the right response, which it henceforth
invariably reiterates on every similar occasion.</p>
<p>Any machine that is to represent learning presupposes a theory of
acquiring knowledge and a theory of knowledge itself. The machine which
I have just mentioned assumes that in spite of the incessant changes
sweeping through the world, identifiable states of affairs keep
recurring and can actually be recognized as such both by the animal and
the observer; and that there are right responses to such identifiable
occasions which can be reiterated, so that the responses too are
identifiable. We have seen before (p. 81) that a belief in the existence
of identifiable things, to which we can respond by identifiable actions,
underlies the process of denotation and that it justifies the kind of
induction which underlies the descriptive sciences. This justification
can be readily extended further to other processes of inductive
reasoning by interpreting a learned response ‘If A then do X’ as saying
likewise ‘If A, then expect B’ The learning machine is then seen to
operate by the kind of random accumulation of observations which,
according to the currently predominant conception of the scientific
method, results by chance in the discovery of the constant conjunctions
known to science.</p>
<p>But I must digress here briefly in order to keep clear the tracks
along which this enquiry is proceeding. Granted that the study of
learning is an appreciation of an animal’s behaviour by the standards of
inductive logic, the following question arises. I have separated earlier
on our acknowledgment of a deductive inference from the study of the
psychological process which embodies it and may interfere with it
(pp. 332–4). Hence it may seem questionable whether, in the study of
learning, the acknowledgment of rightness which accounts for the success
of learning and accredits its achievements with universal intent, may be
lumped together with the study of the conditions and shortcomings of
learning. My answer is that the distinction in question is sharply
pronounced only in the case of highly formalized logical operations. It
becomes blurred and should be allowed to lapse altogether, when
rightness is achieved according to vague maxims which are effective only
when applied with exceptional skill and understanding. Such, I believe,
is the case for inductive inferences. The analysis of such operational
principles is so closely interwoven with a study of the conditions under
which they can operate or fail to operate, that the two aspects of the
subject must be treated jointly.54 Thus in spite of the logical and
epistemological affirmations contained in the theory of learning, we
shall accept it wholly as a branch of psychology and authorize this
branch to study—as all biology does—certain achievements ascribed to
living beings.</p>
<p>Looking then at the psychology of learning as a study of empirical
inference, we can assess its current methods and results by recalling
our earlier critique of the philosophic theories of empirical inference.
Since such inference can be formalized only superficially, any rules
laid down for carrying out empirical inferences must be highly
ambiguous. Hence a machine designed to carry out such inferences can
present but a clumsy imitation of actual processes of inference. A
psychology of learning which strives for objectivity by representing the
process of learning in terms of a formalized inductive logic can
likewise achieve, therefore, only a semblance of its aim. It will have
(1) to curtail its subject matter to the crudest forms of learning and
(2) to exploit at the same time the ambiguity of its supposedly
impersonal terms, so that they will appear to apply to the performances
of a living being which are covertly kept in mind.</p>
<p>I shall illustrate both these points from the otherwise distinguished
work of C. L. Hull, whose method has exercised a profound influence on
psychologists since the publication of The Principles of Behavior in
1943.55 The treatise opens with the definition of a stimulus by the
example of a light ray entering the eye. This (it says) is the stimulus
S. But later—halfway through the work—it is admitted that there is
always an indefinite variety of stimuli impinging on the animal’s sense
organs, and hence there is no such thing as the stimulus S. At this
stage ‘attention’ is mentioned in quotation marks, as a loan from
introspection which we must ignore, and the role of ‘attention’ is
replaced forthwith by a previously established habit which is supposed
to have been acquired by the very process—involving the alleged
objective predominance of a single stimulus—which had just been
abandoned as fallacious. Actually, the animal’s role in directing its
own attention remains unacknowledged and unaccounted for; as it is found
missing also from all formalized theories of induction. This deficiency
reappears with even more far-reaching consequences in Hull’s analysis of
discrimination. This opens by defining generalization as the capacity to
respond in a similar manner to similar stimuli, and observes then that
if the response to the similar stimulus remains repeatedly unrewarded it
will cease to elicit the response, so that as a result of this, the
animal discriminates between the two similar stimuli. This theory is an
application of induction ‘by agreement and difference’ as laid down by
J. S. Mill, and it suffers from the same shortcomings. Since no
ingenuity is supposed to be involved on the part of the animal (which
functions as an automaton) there is no limit set either to its powers of
induction—provided that its sense organs are adequate to the task.
Hence, if a dog were consistently offered food whenever it was shown the
radiogram of diseased lungs and no food when shown the radiogram of
healthy lungs, it should learn to diagnose pulmonary diseases. An
objectivist theory of learning leads to the same absurdities as an
objectivist theory of induction: since it has no place for heuristic
powers it cannot account for their obvious limitations. And, of course,
it likewise fails to account for such heuristic powers as even rats do
manifest—as when Lashley’s mutilated rats produced entirely new motor
patterns for running a maze which they had learned before as intact
animals.56</p>
<p>Yet all these oversimplifications fail to achieve their purpose. For
even the most elaborate objectivist nomenclature cannot conceal the
teleological character of learning and the normative intention of its
study. Its supposedly objective terms still do not refer to purposeless
facts but to well functioning things. Something is a ‘stimulus’ only if
it succeeds in stimulating. And though ‘responses’ may be meaningless in
themselves, the state of affairs called ‘reinforcement’ functions as
such by converting at least one particular response into a sign or a
means to an end. Moreover, the result of a series of successful
reinforcements is, by definition, a habit whick the experimenter deems
right. So even the most rigidly formalized theory of learning does lay
down a system of rightness for the purpose of assessing and interpreting
the rationality of the animal’s behaviour.</p>
<p>Besides, the behaviourist vocabulary of learning, intelligence, etc.,
would be unintelligible to us but for our convivial understanding of the
animals under observation. It is a mere pseudo-substitution, which
relies for its meaning entirely on our familiarity with the conceptions
it is trying to replace. This applies even to the most liberal and
creative behaviourism, that of E. C. Tolman, and to the logical
behaviourism of Gilbert Ryle which I now propose to criticize from this
point of view.</p>
<p>Tolman assumes that what is commonly called the observation of a
mental state is additional to an observation of its manifestations.
Hence he declares (as others of this school have done before) that ‘all
that can ever actually be observed in fellow human beings . . . is
behavior’,57 and concludes that any reference to mental states is
unnecessary. Ryle argues, on the contrary, that there is no mind as
distinct from its workings and that it is meaningless to refer to it as
such.58 Both conclusions fail to take into account that a focal
observation of the particulars by which a person’s mind manifests itself
is something different from a subsidiary awareness of these particulars
within a focal observation of the mind. Owing to the absence of this
distinction, both psychological and logical behaviourism miscarry.</p>
<p>Take first the latter. The focal observation of the workings of
someone’s mind dissolves our knowledge of his mind, so that in this
sense these workings are certainly not his mind. On the other hand, a
comprehensive awareness of these workings constitutes an observation (or
reading) of the mind, which may appear to vindicate Professor Ryle, but
does not in fact do so. For Ryle does not have the conception of
subsidiary awareness, and his identification of the mind with its
workings can therefore only mean that the two are identical in the usual
sense, i.e. as focally observed facts, which is false.</p>
<p>The fundamental postulate of Tolman’s behaviourism collapses in
either formulation. For it is not possible to keep track of a mind’s
workings except by comprehending them, so that a focal observation of
the particulars of intelligent behaviour is impossible. And if, on the
contrary, we observe these particulars comprehensively, we are in fact
focussing not on the behaviour, but on the mind of which they are the
workings. We are reading the mind at work in these particulars.</p>
<p>Such is the convivial relation which serves as the channel of all
psychological observations, and within which all the terms of psychology
must be interpreted. It is the same relation in which we have observed
the active and perceptive centre of animals and have seen, at the level
of learning, the animal committing its whole person to an effort of
rational inference. It is the relation in which we take an interest in a
fellow-being for its own sake and appreciate its achievements by
standards set for it by ourselves. We shall see presently that this
conviviality comprises at a further stage, when the other person rises
above ourselves, an acceptance of another’s iudgment of ourselves.</p>
