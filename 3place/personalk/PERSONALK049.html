<h4 id="axiomatization-of-mathematics">11. AXIOMATIZATION OF
MATHEMATICS</h4>
<p>Once more we are brought up against the image of a living science,
groping its way towards the satisfaction of the intellectual passions
upholding its values. We see it originating thousands of venturesome
guesses which had long obsessed their authors until they laboriously
brought them to the test of completion, and often battled for them
against protracted objections, until they finally gained their
established places in the textbooks. And again we see the curious
contrast between this image and the ideal of casting the result of this
heuristic process—and by implication any further continuation of it—into
a strictly formalized system of axioms and symbolic operations. Indeed,
for mathematics this ideal was not left to be pursued by philosophers,
as was the case in the natural sciences, but was included in the
endeavour towards an ever greater generality and rigour inherent in the
pursuit of mathematics itself.79</p>
<p>As such it does not concern us here. But we must ask—as we did in the
case of the natural sciences—what the logical position of this system of
formal premisses is and, in particular, on what grounds we accept it as
valid. The answer to both questions follows closely what has been said
about the axiomatization of the natural sciences. When certain undefined
terms, axioms and symbolic operations are established as the logical
antecedents of mathematics, these are based on the prior assumption that
mathematics is true. Our acceptance of what is logically anterior is
based on our prior acceptance of what is logically derivative, as being
implied in our acceptance of the latter.</p>
<p>Axiomatization has indeed proved a powerful method in the pursuit of
greater generality and rigour in all deductive sciences. But it has not
supplied a formalized organon for the process of future discovery. Nor
has it become the supreme arbiter in deciding controversial issues in
mathematics. It is not necessary to show in this case—as we did for
natural science—why this is so, for it has been demonstrably established
that apart from fairly elementary problems which in a sense are trivial,
there cannot exist a method which would always lead in a finite number
of steps to the solution of a problem, nor is there any formal procedure
that can tell us what problem would be thus decidable.80 This conclusion
could have been partly anticipated from the fact that major steps in
mathematics often involve conceptual decisions which can by their very
nature never be rigorously proved right.</p>
<p>We can now turn to the paradox of a mathematics based on a system of
axioms which are not regarded as self-evident and indeed cannot be known
to be mutually consistent. To apply the utmost ingenuity and the most
rigorous care to prove the theorems of logic or mathematics, while the
premisses of these inferences are cheerfully accepted, without any
grounds being given for doing so, as ‘unproven asserted formulae’, might
seem altogether absurd. It reminds one of the clown who solemnly sets up
in the middle of the arena two gateposts with a securely locked gate
between them, pulls out a large bunch of keys, and laboriously selects
one which opens the lock, then passes through the gate and carefully
locks it after himself—while all the while the whole arena lies open on
either side of the gateposts where he could go round them unhindered. A
fully axiom-atized deductive system is like a carefully locked gate in
the midst of an infinite empty area. If the acceptance of any proof
requires the acceptance without proof of some presuppositions from which
the proof is ultimately derived, it follows that the principle of
rejecting any unproven statement in mathematics implies also the
rejection of all proven statements and therefore of all mathematics.</p>
<p>The solution lies in rejecting the rule which denies acceptance to
unproven statements, by admitting that our belief in logically anterior
maxims of mathematical procedure is based on our previous acceptance of
this procedure as valid. And let us remember once more that logical
antecedents derived from the prior acceptance of their consequents are
necessarily less certain than the consequents. It is clearly
unreasonable, therefore, to regard these antecedents as the grounds on
which we accept their consequents.</p>
<p>We should declare instead candidly that we dwell on mathematics and
affirm its statements for the sake of its intellectual beauty, which
betokens the reality of its conceptions and the truth of its assertions.
For if this passion were extinct, we would cease to understand
mathematics; its conceptions would dissolve and its proofs carry no
conviction. Mathematics would become pointless and would lose itself in
a welter of insignificant tautologies and of Heath Robinson operations,
from which it could no longer be distinguished.</p>
<p>Mathematics has once already fallen into oblivion by becoming
incomprehensible. After the death of Apollonius in 205 B.C. there
occurred a break in the oral tradition which alone made the mathematical
texts of the Greeks intelligible to students.81 This was probably due in
part to a growing distrust of mathematics, owing to its conflict with
the conception of number at the point where it led to magnitudes like
which could not be expressed in terms of integers. In our own time
Godel’s theorem of uncertainty might conceivably erode confidence,
likewise, in our own mathematics. And other influences might deepen this
distrust. Ideological utilitarianism censures Archimedes today for
speaking lightly of his own practical inventions and his passion for
intellectual beauty, which he expressed by desiring his grave to be
marked by his most brilliant geometrical theorem, is dismissed as an
aberration. This movement would discredit the core of mathematics, which
is its intellectual beauty. The transmission of mathematics has today
been rendered more precarious than ever by the fact that no single
mathematician can fully understand any longer more than a tiny fraction
of mathematics. Modern mathematics can be kept alive only by a large
number of mathematicians cultivating different parts of the same system
of values: a community which can be kept coherent only by the passionate
vigilance of universities, journals and meetings, fostering these values
and imposing the same respect for them on all mathematicians.82 Such a
far-flung structure is highly vulnerable and, once broken, impossible to
restore. Its ruins would bury modern mathematics in an oblivion more
complete and lasting than that which enveloped Greek mathematics
twenty-two centuries ago.</p>
