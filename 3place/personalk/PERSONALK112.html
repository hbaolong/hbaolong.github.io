<h4 id="learning">6. LEARNING</h4>
<p>In this rapid survey of the ascending stages of biological knowledge
I must disregard many aspects of the subject. I shall proceed now to
reflect on our knowledge of learning, without taking into account the
component due to learning in the animal’s capacity for primitive action
and perception. I shall also leave out altogether the domain of
ethology, and concentrate on the psychology of learning, based on animal
experiments. I shall take advantage of my earlier treatment of this
subject by using mainly examples already mentioned there.</p>
<p>Take first experiments with the discrimination box. Here the
psychologist places the animal in a situation which constitutes a
problem for the satisfaction of some of its major drives, usually
hunger. A process of learning will originate from this arrangement only
if (1) the animal recognizes the problem and responds to it, and if (2)
this problem demands an appreciable measure of ingenuity, but not more
than the animal in fact possesses. The limited alternatives offered to
the animal force it to respond (if it responds at all) in a manner that
can be classed as correct or false. Moreover, the experiment is so
devised that the animal’s choice between a correct and a false response
has to be made at a particular point in time and space. The narrowness
of the experimental situation tends to key up the animal’s state of
perplexity at a choice point, to a tension which is not likely to be
reached in the wider circumstances of nature. Thus the laboratory both
intensifies and spotlights the moments of heuristic effort by which the
animal’s active centre rises to the performance of an intelligent
judgment.</p>
<p>I have given evidence for this before, which I shall presently expand
further. Meanwhile let me recall that we have identified sign-learning
with a process of inductive inference.42 The question: How does an
animal learn to recognize a sign? (or if the reflex language is
preferred, How is an animal conditioned to a particular stimulus?) is
therefore essentially akin to the epistemological question: how can
correct generalizations be drawn from experience? The fact that the
animal is generalizing about events engineered by ourselves does not
distinguish it from us in this respect, since as subjects both the
animal and we ourselves are faced with events beyond our control.43</p>
<p>But there are certain differences. Epistemology reflects on knowledge
which we ourselves believe we possess; the psychologist studies
knowledge which he believes to have been acquired by another individual
and studies also the shortcomings of such knowledge. No knowledge,
whether our own or that of a rat, is fully specifiable; but the fact
that we must rely on recognizing the rat’s knowledge, or ignorance, from
our own knowledge of the rat’s behaviour, involves an additional enquiry
and an additional unspecifiability. Let me add also that (in view of the
fact that in animal experiments the achievement of learning must always
manifest itself in appropriate behaviour) I shall subsume here, for
brevity, trick-learning under sign-learning, except when the trick is
manifestly contrived from known elements, as in Köhler’s experiments on
apes.44 I shall also admit fully, from the start, the presence of latent
learning in all types of learning, though in some cases it is found
almost lacking.</p>
<p>We can now run through the various alternative outcomes of learning
experiments.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We consider that learning has been fully achieved only if,
judging by the animal’s behaviour, we believe that it has formed a
generalization which we consider to be the correct solution to its
problem. In experiments of the type used by Guthrie, in which learning
is achieved by pure accident, the ensuing generalization will usually
contain many irrelevant elements. (The animal may be said to be mistaken
then in the sense in which primitive man is, who does not know clearly
whether it is his axe, or the incantation by which he accompanies its
strokes, that fells the tree.) A correct generalization must be free of
such errors. It should offer a sufficient understanding of the
problematic situation for establishing the necessary conditions of
success.</p></li>
<li><p>Clever Hans, faced with a blackboard which meant nothing to him,
found a solution to the problem of obtaining the reward offered by the
experimenter, by watching the man’s behaviour while he, Hans, was
tapping the ground. This generalization may be regarded as subjectively
correct, as it was the most reasonable that could be established within
the range of the animal’s competence. We may similarly regard as
subjectively correct the generalization by which red-green colour blind
people distinguish by means of secondary signs the two kinds of
colouring. The forming of false ‘initial hypotheses’ (‘turn always to
the right’, or ‘always to the left’, or ‘alternately right and left’)
may be also classed in this category. 45</p></li>
<li><p>Lashley and Franz (1917), experimenting with a ‘problem box’,
observed that a rat which accidentally opened the box by a fall from the
roof of the restraining cage, attempted to repeat this feat fifty times
in vain before the method was abandoned.46 This rat had formed a
mistaken generalization.</p></li>
<li><p>Rats with extensive cerebral destruction never learn anything. In
a maze they move about at random. Rats suffering from experimental
neurosis behave obsessively.47 These animals form no
generalizations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The four grades according to which we classified reasonable action
and perception reappear here in the classification of empirical
inferences. We have (1) objectively reasonable inference, (2) reasonable
error, (3) subjectively reasonable inference, and (4) unreason, i.e. no
inference. And once more, each of these grades assesses the subject’s
performances by standards set for it by the observer, from his own
understanding of the problem he has set to it.</p>
<p>But we notice also, proceeding from (4) to (1), a hardening of the
claims to universality, combined with a quickening of the heuristic
impulse, and as a joint result of these a more emphatic act of
commitment. This threefold shift of emphasis could already be noticed
when passing from consummatory action to perception. It has been
actually anticipated already in Parts Two and Three by the linking of
learning to problem-solving. For a problem is the intimation of a hidden
rational relationship which is felt to be accessible by an heuristic
effort, and the discovery of which may be accompanied, even in animals,
by the lively enjoyment of their own ingenuity. By searching for such a
hidden relation and by its eventual joyful acceptance, the animal
reaches out towards something more objectively satisfying than food or
sex, and in this sense the ensuing commitment becomes more radical.
Egocentric desire gives way to personal assertion; the corruptible puts
on incorruption.</p>
<p>I have given evidence before of the emotional upheaval which
accompanies the mental reorganization necessary for crossing the logical
gap that separates a problem from its solution. I have pointed out that
the depth of this upheaval corresponds to the force of personal judgment
required to supplement the inadequate clues on which a decision is being
based. Experiments producing a nervous breakdown in animals lay bare in
the simplest possible terms both the tension of this choosing power, and
the limits within which this tension is bearable.</p>
<p>In Pavlov’s classical investigations a dog was first trained to
accept a circle, or a nearly circular ellipse, as a sign for immediately
forthcoming food and a flat ellipse as a sign for ‘no food just now’.48
The hungry animal watching the different signs was found committing
itself—as the variations in the secretion of its saliva showed—to the
two alternative expectations which these two signs justified. So long as
the signs of opposite significance were widely different—the ellipse
being either very flat or nearly circular—the dogs reacted to them
without developing symptoms of nervous strain. But when the hungry
animal was repeatedly shown intermediate shapes, its behaviour underwent
a profound change. It turned wild and angrily strained and snapped to
set itself free. At the same time it had lost all its powers of
discrimination and was giving false reactions to signs to which it had
been perfectly conditioned before. After a while the animal would fall
into abnormal listlessness and refuse to react altogether to any of the
formerly established signs.</p>
<p>Previously I derived the presence of intellectual passions in animals
from the way they rejoice in performing a new trick, regardless of its
material result. We may now observe, similarly, that Pavlov’s dogs were
affected by their incapacity to distinguish between the signs of Food or
No Food, far more than their care for food would warrant. We may take
this to prove that they were labouring under an effort to discriminate,
and that, as the problem facing them was made increasingly difficult,
this effort eventually exhausted, or temporarily overstrained and
paralysed, their powers of rational control.</p>
<p>The extent of this damage shows the depth to which the animal’s
person is involved even in such an elementary heuristic effort. The
animal disintegrates emotionally, as well as intellectually. The
neurotic dog which can only snarl or sulk ceases to be a companion to
us. And we realize then, if we had not done so before, that the
intelligence of the animal and our appreciation of it was convivial: it
formed a link between his person and ours.</p>
<p>Pavlov has observed that the experimental neurosis of dogs can be
healed by presenting the animals for a while with signs of a clearly
distinguishable kind and accompanying these consistently with the offer
of food, or the reverse. The successful solution of these simple
problems seems to restore an animal’s self-confidence, much as
occupational therapy helps to restore the shattered personality of the
neurotic.49</p>
<p>A manifest proof that an animal’s capacity for straining its powers
of rational inference is linked to the very core of its emotional and
intellectual personality, was discovered by Jacobsen in 1934.50 He found
that chimpanzees who were liable to nervous breakdown when subjected to
excessive mental strain, were rendered safe against such ill-effects if
their frontal lobes were severed or eliminated. Though the animal’s
ability to solve problems is noticeably impaired, its intellectual
frustrations cease to worry it and no longer endanger its balance of
mind.51 Soon after this discovery, Edgar Moniz showed that a similar
operation, when performed on patients suffering from melancholia, may
relieve their depression, and that it markedly reduces at the same time
the depth of their personality, rendering them crude, improvident and
grossly inconsiderate. The chimpanzee’s capacity intensely to worry
about a problem is thus seen to be akin to man’s capacity for
self-control, guided by a sense of responsibility.</p>
