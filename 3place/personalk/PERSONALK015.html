<h4 id="randomness-and-significant-pattern">2. RANDOMNESS AND
SIGNIFICANT PATTERN</h4>
<p>But the conceptions introduced so far are yet insufficiently rooted
in their subject matter. We must correct this now by shifting our
attention to the nature of randomness and of significant patterns. We
can sum up the conclusions of the last chapter in these terms, as
follows. Statements of probability can be made about random systems and
about significantly ordered systems in so far as these are affected by
interaction with random systems. Though intimations of significant order
may be rendered uncertain by random disturbances, such heuristic
surmises remain essentially different from the act of guessing the
outcome of a random event. We can reformulate in this sense also the
lessons reached so far on the subject of Chance and Order in this
chapter. Randomness alone can never produce a significant pattern, for
it consists in the absence of any such pattern; and we must not treat
the configuration of a random event as a significant pattern, whether by
attributing to it fictitiously a distinctiveness that it does not
possess, as in the case of the scattered pebbles, or by granting it
erroneously a specious significance, such as the fulfilment of a
horoscope.2</p>
<p>Probability statements are therefore always based on an anterior
knowledge of randomness. But how can wc tell that certain aggregates are
disposed at random, or that certain events are occurring at random? My
answer to this question will have to be postponed until much later. But
I shall anticipate it here by asserting my belief that random systems
exist and can be recognized as such, though it is logically impossible
to give any precise definition of randomness.</p>
<p>Indeed, I shall suggest that the contrast between identifiable
objects and their accidental surroundings which underlies all acts of
visual perception can be expressed in these terms. When the eye divides
the field of vision into ‘figure’ and ‘background’, it prepares to see
the figure retain its identity while moving forward, backward or
sideways against a background which, by contrast, is essentially at rest
and retains its background character even while undergoing an indefinite
variety of changes. No feature of the background may be linked in an
orderly manner to the figure. Hence all relations of the background
features to the figure must be random, and this will be best safeguarded
if the background is random in itself. Similarly, a process
unambiguously determined by an ordering principle, such as the motion of
the planets round the sun, can be said to constitute a closed system of
events only to the extent to which its relations to other objects and
events are found to be purely random. Any entity—whether an object or
determinate process—will be the more clearly set off against its
background, the more amply its internal particulars show steadiness and
regularity—combined with an amply confirmed absence of any co-variance
between these particulars and those of the background.3</p>
<p>We may even grade the intensity of coherent existence on this scale.
Owing to its more significant internal structure a human being is a more
substantial entity than a pebble. The difference can be appreciated by
comparing the sciences of anatomy and physiology with the range of
interest offered by the structure of a particular type of pebble. Every
kind of human knowing, ranging from perception to scientific
observation, includes an appreciation both of order contrasted to
randomness and of the degree of this order. We have seen that
information theory ascribes in fact a numerical value to the degree of
order present in an ordered system forming a message.</p>
<p>A solid object bombarded by the random elements of the medium forming
its background will itself be set into random motion. The Brownian
movement of microscopic particles caused by the thermal motion of the
surrounding molecules exemplifies this principle. The calculus of
probability applies pre-eminently to the Brownian movement of
symmetrical solids. A perfectly unbiassed die, resting on one of its six
sides, will occasionally be tumbled over by an exceptionally violent
Brownian shock. We can then say that the chances of the die resting on
any particular side are equal The randomness of the impacts to which the
die is subject transposes the orderliness of its cubic symmetry into the
identical frequency of its six alternative stable positions.4 Such
dynamic interaction between order and randomness is a necessary and
sufficient condition for the applicability of probability statements to
mechanical systems. We shall see later that it is also an ultimate
condition, not reducible to any more fundamental terms.5</p>
<p>An ordering principle can be extrinsic, as in the case of a message
or any other artefact, or intrinsic, as shown in the ordered coherence
of a solid body and in any stable configuration, whether static or
dynamic. I shall now describe three imaginary experiments which reveal
the characteristic behaviour of both kinds of ordered systems under
random impacts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Take a large number of perfect dice resting on a plane surface
and all showing the same face—say a one—on top. The orderliness of these
dice is purely extrinsic. Prolonged Brownian motion will destroy this
orderliness and ultimately produce a state of maximum disorder, in which
all faces will show on top with nearly the same frequency.</p></li>
<li><p>Take a similar set of dice showing the one on top, but let them
be biassed in favour of showing a six on top. This shall be contrived by
weighting the upper half of the dice so that when they are turned round
to show the six on top their potential energy shall decrease by ΔE.
Prolonged Brownian motion acting at low temperatures, where ΔE kT, (k =
Boltzman’s constant, T = absolute temperature) will cause a
rearrangement in the sense that most dice will show a six on top. This
is a stable pattern due to an intrinsic (dynamic) ordering
principle.</p></li>
<li><p>Having produced the dynamically stable pattern we increase the
temperature so that kT ΔE. Prolonged Brownian motion will destroy this
pattern once more and produce instead the same kind of random aggregate
as in experiment (1), with all faces showing on top with nearly the same
frequency.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Experiment 2 shows that random impulses may release the operation of
forces which tend to produce a stable pattern. Where such a dynamic
ordering principle is lacking, as in Experiment 1, the existing order is
destroyed in the long run even by the weakest random impulses. But
random impulses of a sufficient strength as applied in Experiment 3 will
destroy likewise any dynamically stable order, even though this order
came into existence originally by the impact of random impulses of
lesser intensity.6</p>
<p>Communication theory has computed the blurring of a message by
background noises. This illustrates Experiment 1, i.e. the purely
destructive effect of random impulses on a meaningful artefact.
Experiment 2 can be illustrated by the annealing of a piece of
cold-worked metal. The atomic pattern, shattered by hammering or
rolling, spontaneously re-crystallizes under the influence of moderate
heating. But heating to higher temperatures once more disorganizes the
crystalline pattern; when its temperature is raised beyond its melting
point, the metal fuses and finally evaporates. Thus Experiment 3 follows
on Experiment 2.</p>
<p>This model represents in principle the whole sweep of statistical
thermodynamics and kinetics and generalizes at the same time the laws of
thermal motion to any random impacts.7 It also extends the range of
ordering principles and thereby includes information theory. By a
further generalization we shall take in later also the principles
ordering the growth and functioning, as well as the reproduction and
evolution, of living beings, which will substantiate the critique of
natural selection at which I have hinted already.</p>
<p>For the moment, it is enough to recognize here that, in affirming
these fundamental laws of nature, we accredit our capacity for knowing
randomness from order in nature and that this distinction cannot be
based on considerations of numerical probabilities, since the calculus
of probabilities presupposes, on the contrary, our capacity to
understand and recognize randomness in nature.</p>
