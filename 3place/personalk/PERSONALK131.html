<li><p>Mesmer (1734–1815) was denounced as an impostor; Esdaile
(1808–59) carried out about 300 major operations painlessly under
mesmeric trance in India, but neither in India nor in Great Britain
could he get medical journals to print accounts of his work. His results
were explained by the assumption that natives liked to be operated upon
and tried to please Esdaile. In England in 1842 W. S. Ward amputated a
leg painlessly under mesmeric trance and reported the case to the Royal
Medical and Chirurgical Society. ‘The Society however refused to
believe. Marshall Hall, the pioneer in the study of reflex action, urged
that the patient must have been an impostor, and the note of the paper’s
having been read was stricken from the minutes of the Society . . .
Eight years later, Marshall Hail informed the Society that the patient
had confessed to an imposition, but that the source of his information
was indirect and confidential. The patient, however, then signed a
declaration that the operation had been painless.’ Elliotson (1791–1868)
was Professor of Medicine in the University College, London, founder of
University College Hospital, practised mesmerism there, mainly for
therapeutical purposes, until in 1837 the Council of University College
forbade this practice, whereupon he resigned his chair. (This account is
based on and the quotations are from E. Boring, History of Experimental
Psychology, New York, 2nd edn., 1950. It is supported in greater detail
in respect to Elliotson’s career in Harley Williams, Doctors Differ,
London, 1946. See Part One, ch. 4, p. 52 above.)</p></li>

Reality, London, 1955, p. 61.</p></li>
<li><p>Although I should not venture to declare that my argument in the
present section agrees entirely with the views of any one theological
writer, I find my own conception of the scope and method of a
progressive Protestant theology confirmed by many passages in the
writings of Paul Tillich. See, for example, his Systematic Theology, 1,
London, 1953, p. 130: ‘Science, psychology, and history are allies of
theology in the fight against the supranaturalistic distortions of
genuine revelation. Scientific and historical criticism protect
revelation; they cannot dissolve it, for revelation belongs to a
dimension of reality for which scientific and historical analysis are
inadequate. Revelation is the manifestation of the depth of reason and
the ground of being. It points to the mystery of existence and to our
ultimate concern. It is independent of what science and history say
about the conditions in which it appears; and it cannot make science and
history dependent on itself. No conflict between different dimensions of
reality is possible. Reason receives revelation in ecstasy and miracles;
but reason is not destroyed by revelation, just as revelation is not
emptied by reason.’ Or on ‘the dynamics of revelation’ (ibid., p. 140):
‘It is true that “Jesus Christ . . . the same yesterday, today and
forever” is the immovable point of reference in all periods of church
history. But the act of referring is never the same, since new
generations with new potentialities of reception enter the correlation
and transform it.’ On the other hand (p. 144): ‘Knowledge of revelation,
although it is mediated primarily through historical events, does not
imply factual assertion, and it is therefore not exposed to critical
analysis by historical research. Its truth is to be judged by criteria
which lie within the dimension of revelatory knowledge.’</p></li>

p. 179. The effect of self-condemnation in eliciting Communist
confessions was first described by Arthur Koestler in Darkness at Noon.
Since the accounts of some former prisoners have failed to confirm
Koestler’s theory, I have discussed the matter at some length with
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Ignotus, who broadly endorsed the theory from their
own extensive experience. The resistance of Communist prisoners against
the accusations made against them is much reduced by their continued
acceptance of Marxism-Leninism, and some prisoners go so far as utterly
to doubt their own reason rather than to call in question the judgment
of the Party.</p></li>

two alternative systems of scientific explanation are separated by a
logical gap and thus give rise to passionate controversy in science. See

<li><p>Other examples of this procedure in which its result subsequently
proved erroneous were given before in sec. 4. of this chapter to
illustrate the equivalence of belief and doubt.</p></li>
<li><p>The wise neglect of awkward facts may be of value even for the
development of the deductive sciences. Greek mathematicians allowed
themselves to be discouraged from developing algebra by the
impossibility of representing the ratio of two incommensurable line
segments in terms of whole numbers. B. L. Van der Waerden (Science
Awakening, Groningen, 1954, p. 266) says that ‘it does honour to Greek
mathematics that it adhered inexorably to such logical consistency’. But
had their successors been as exacting in their logical scruples,
mathematics would have died of its own rigor.</p></li>
