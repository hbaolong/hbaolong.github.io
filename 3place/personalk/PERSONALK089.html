<h4 id="the-stability-of-scientific-beliefs">10. THE STABILITY OF
SCIENTIFIC BELIEFS</h4>
<p>We do not share the beliefs of Azande in the power of poison-oracles,
and we reject a great many of their other beliefs, discarding mystical
conceptions and replacing them by naturalistic explanations. But we may
yet deny that our rejection of Zande superstitions is the outcome of any
general principle of doubt.</p>
<p>For the stability of the naturalistic system which we currently
accept instead rests on the same logical structure. Any contradiction
between a particular scientific notion and the facts of experience will
be explained by other scientific notions; there is a ready reserve of
possible scientific hypotheses available to explain any conceivable
event. Secured by its circularity and defended further by its
epicyclical reserves, science may deny, or at least cast aside as of no
scientific interest, whole ranges of experience which to the
unscientific mind appear both massive and vital.28</p>
<p>The restrictions of the scientific outlook which I summed up as
objectivism have been recurrent themes throughout this book. My attempt
to break out of this highly stabilized framework and to enter avenues of
legitimate access to reality from which objectivism debars us will be
presently pursued further. At the moment I only wish to give some
illustrations to show how, within science itself the stability of
theories against experience is maintained by epicyclical reserves which
suppress alternative conceptions in the germ; a procedure which in
retrospect will appear right in some instances and wrong in others.</p>
<p>The theory of electrolytic dissociation proposed in 1887 by Arrhenius
assumed a chemical equilibrium between the dissociated and the
undissociated forms of an electrolyte in solution. From the very start,
the measurements showed that this was true only for weak electrolytes
like acetic acid, but not for the very prominent group of strong
electrolytes, like common salt or sulphuric acid. For more than thirty
years the discrepancies were carefully measured and tabulated in
textbooks, yet no one thought of calling in question the theory which
they so flagrantly contradicted. Scientists were satisfied with speaking
of the ‘anomalies of strong electrolytes’, without doubting for a moment
that their behaviour was in fact governed by the law that they failed to
obey. I can still remember my own amazement when, about 1919, I first
heard the idea mooted that the anomalies were to be regarded as a
refutation of the equilibrium postulated by Arrhenius and to be
explained by a different theory. Not until this alternative conception
(based on the mutual electrostatic interaction of the ions) was
successfully elaborated in detail, was the previous theory generally
abandoned.</p>
<p>Contradictions to current scientific conceptions are often disposed
of by calling them ‘anomalies’; this is the handiest assumption in the
epicyclical reserve of any theory. We have seen how Azande make use of
similar excuses to meet the inconsistencies of poison-oracles. In
science this process has often proved brilliantly justified, when
subsequent revisions of the adverse evidence or a deepening of the
original theory explained the anomalies. The modification of Arrhenius’s
theory for strong electrolytes is a case in point.</p>
<p>Another example may illustrate how a series of observations which at
one time were held to be important scientific facts, were a few years
later completely discredited and committed to oblivion, without ever
having been disproved or indeed newly tested, simply because the
conceptual framework of science had meanwhile so altered that the facts
no longer appeared credible. Towards the end of the last century
numerous observations were reported by H. B. Baker29 on the power of
intensive drying to stop some normally extremely rapid chemical
reactions and to reduce the rate of evaporation of a number of commonly
used chemicals. Baker went on publishing further instances of this
drying effect for more than thirty years.30 A large number of allegedly
allied phenomena were reported from Holland by Smits31 and Some very
striking demonstrations of it came from Germany.32 H. B. Baker could
render his samples unreactive sometimes only by drying them for periods
up to three years; so when some authors failed to reproduce his results
it was reasonable to assume that they had not achieved the same degree
of desiccation. Consequently, there was little doubt at the time that
the observed effects of intensive drying were true and that they
reflected a fundamental feature of all chemical change.</p>
<p>Today these experiments, which aroused so much interest from 1900 to
1930, are almost forgotten. Textbooks of chemistry which thoughtlessly
go on compiling published data still record Baker’s observations in
detail, merely adding that their validity ‘is not yet certainly
established’,33 or that ‘some (of his) findings are disputed by later
workers, but the technique is difficult’.34 But active scientists no
longer take any interest in these phenomena, for in view of their
present understanding of chemical processes they are convinced that most
of them must have been spurious, and that, if some were real, they were
likely to have been due to trivial causes.35 This being so, our attitude
towards these experiments is now similar to that of Azande towards
Evans-Pritchard’s suggestion of trying out the effects of oracle-poison
without an accompanying incantation. We shrug our shoulders and refuse
to waste our time on such obviously fruitless enquiries. The process of
selecting facts for our attention is indeed the same in science as among
Azande; but I believe that science is often right in its application of
it, while Azande are quite wrong when using it for protecting their
superstitions.36</p>
<p>I conclude that what earlier philosophers have alluded to by speaking
of coherence as the criterion of truth is only a criterion of stability.
It may equally stabilize an erroneous or a true view of the universe.
The attribution of truth to any particular stable alternative is a
fiduciary act which cannot be analysed in non-committal terms. I shall
return to this point in my next chapter. At the moment it only serves to
make it clear that there exists no principle of doubt the operation of
which will discover for us which of two systems of implicit beliefs is
true—except in the sense that we will admit decisive evidence against
the one we do not believe to be true, and not against the other. Once
more, the admission of doubt proves here to be as clearly an act of
belief as does the non-admission of doubt.</p>
