<h4 id="objectivity-and-modern-physics">4. OBJECTIVITY AND MODERN
PHYSICS</h4>
<p>We cannot truly account for our acceptance of such theories without
endorsing our acknowledgement of a beauty that exhilarates and a
profundity that entrances us. Yet the prevailing conception of science,
based on the disjunction of subjectivity and objectivity, seeks—and must
seek at all costs—to eliminate from science such passionate, personal,
human appraisals of theories, or at least to minimize their function to
that of a negligible by-play. For modern man has set up as the ideal of
knowledge the conception of natural science as a set of statements which
is ‘objective’ in the sense that its substance is entirely determined by
observation, even while its presentation may be shaped by convention.
This conception, stemming from a craving rooted in the very depths of
our culture, would be shattered if the intuition of rationality in
nature had to be acknowledged as a justifiable and indeed essential part
of scientific theory. That is why scientific theory is represented as a
mere economical description of facts; or as embodying a conventional
policy for drawing empirical inferences; or as a working hypothesis,
suited to man’s practical convenience—interpretations that all
deliberately overlook the rational core of science.</p>
<p>That is why, also, if the existence of this rational core yet
reasserts itself, its offensiveness is covered up by a set of
euphemisms, a kind of decent understatement like that used in Victorian
times when legs were called limbs—a bowdlerization which we may observe,
for example, in the attempts to replace ‘rationality’ by ‘simplicity’.
It is legitimate, of course, to regard simplicity as a mark of
rationality, and to pay tribute to any theory as a triumph of
simplicity. But great theories are rarely simple in the ordinary sense
of the term. Both quantum mechanics and relativity are very difficult to
understand; it takes only a few minutes to memorize the facts accounted
for by relativity, but years of study may not suffice to master the
theory and see these facts in its context. Hermann Weyl lets the cat out
of the bag by saying: ‘the required simplicity is not necessarily the
obvious one but we must let nature train us to recognize the true inner
simplicity.’15 In other words, simplicity in science can be made
equivalent to rationality only if ‘simplicity’ is used in a special
sense known solely by scientists. We understand the meaning of the term
‘simple’ only by recalling the meaning of the term ‘rational’ or
‘reasonable’ or ‘such that we ought to assent to it’, which the term
‘simple’ was supposed to replace. The term ‘simplicity’ functions then
merely as a disguise for another meaning than its own. It is used for
smuggling an essential quality into our appreciation of a scientific
theory, which a mistaken conception of objectivity forbids us openly to
acknowledge.</p>
<p>What has just been said of ‘simplicity’ applies equally to ‘symmetry’
and ‘economy’. They are contributing elements in the excellence of a
theory, but can account for its merit only if the meanings of these
terms are stretched far beyond their usual scope, so as to include the
much deeper qualities which make the scientists rejoice in a vision like
that of relativity. They must stand for those peculiar intellectual
harmonies which reveal, more profoundly and permanently than any
sense-experience, the presence of objective truth.</p>
<p>I shall call this practice a pseudo-substitution. It is used to play
down man’s real and indispensable intellectual powers for the sake of
maintaining an ‘objectivist’ framework which in fact cannot account for
them. It works by defining scientific merit in terms of its relatively
trivial features, and making these function then in the same way as the
true terms which they are supposed to replace.</p>
<p>Other areas of science will illustrate even more effectively these
indispensable intellectual powers, and their passionate participation in
the act of knowing. It is to these powers and to this participation that
I am referring in the title of this book as ‘Personal Knowledge’. We
shall find Personal Knowledge manifested in the appreciation of
probability and of order in the exact sciences, and see it at work even
more extensively in the way the descriptive sciences rely on skills and
connoisseurship. At all these points the act of knowing includes an
appraisal; and this personal coefficient, which shapes all factual
knowledge, bridges in doing so the disjunction between subjectivity and
objectivity. It implies the claim that man can transcend his own
subjectivity by striving passionately to fulfil his personal obligations
to universal standards.</p>
