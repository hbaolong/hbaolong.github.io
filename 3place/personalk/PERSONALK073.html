<h4 id="assertions-of-fact">6. ASSERTIONS OF FACT</h4>
<p>Denis de Rougemont has remarked that man alone among animals can lie.
It may be more accurate to say that man can deceive others most
effectively, because he alone can tell them a falsehood. Every
conceivable assertion of fact can be made in good faith or as a lie. The
statement remains the same in both cases, but its tacit components are
different. A truthful statement commits the speaker to a belief in what
he has asserted: he embarks in it on an open sea of limitless
implications. An untruthful statement withholds this belief, launching a
leaking vessel for others to board and sink in it.</p>
<p>Unless an assertion of fact is accompanied by some heuristic or
persuasive feeling, it is a mere form of words saying nothing. Any
attempt to eliminate this personal coefficient, by laying down precise
rules for making or testing assertions of fact, is condemned to futility
from the start. For we can derive rules of observation and verification
only from examples of factual statements that we have accepted as true
before we knew these rules; and in the end the application of our rules
will necessarily fall back once more on factual observations, the
acceptance of which is an act of personal judgment, unguided by any
explicit rules. And besides, the application of such rules must rely all
the time on the guidance of our own personal judgment. This argument
formally confirms the participation of the speaker in any sincere
statement of fact.</p>
<p>How can we take this coefficient into account in our conception of
the truth? What can we mean by saying that a factual statement is
true?</p>
<p>An articulate assertion is composed of two parts: a sentence
conveying the content of what is asserted and a tacit act by which this
sentence is asserted.3 The articulate assertion can be tested by
separating its two parts and tentatively cancelling the act of
assertion, while the unasserted sentence is being confronted with
experience. If as a result of this test we decide to renew the act of
assertion, the two parts are reunited and the sentence is reasserted.
This reassertion may be made explicit by saying that the originally
asserted sentence is true.</p>
<p>The act of assertion itself does not, of course, consist of two
parts—one tacit, the other articulate—of which the first can be
cancelled while the second, now unasserted, can be tested by
confrontation with the facts. It is an act of tacit comprehension, which
relies altogether on the self-satisfaction of the person who performs
it. It can be repeated, improved or cancelled, but not tested or said to
be true, in the sense in which a factual statement can be tested and
said to be true.</p>
<p>Therefore, if ‘p is true’ expresses my assertion or reassertion of
the sentence p, then ‘p is true’ cannot be said to be true or false in
the sense in which a factual sentence can. ‘p is true’ declares that I
identify myself with the content of the factual sentence p, and this
identification is something I am doing, and not a fact that I am
observing. The expression ‘p is true’ is therefore not itself a sentence
but merely the assertion of (an otherwise unasserted) sentence, the
sentence p. To say that ‘p is true’ is to underwrite a commitment or to
sign an acceptance, in a sense akin to the commercial meaning of such
acts. Hence we cannot assert the expression ‘p is true’, any more than
we can endorse our own signature; only a sentence can be asserted, not
an action.</p>
<p>The misleading form of the expression ‘p is true’ which disguises an
act of commitment in the form of a sentence stating a fact leads to
logical paradoxes. If the assertion of the sentence p has to be followed
up by saying ‘p is true’ and ‘p is true’ is itself a sentence, then this
sentence brings in its sequel ‘“p is true” is true’ and so on,
indefinitely. This insatiable regress does not arise, if we realize that
‘p is true’ is not a sentence.</p>
<p>The Paradox of the Liar is eliminated on similar grounds. We may
write this paradox in the form: ‘the sentence on top of page 10 of this
book is false’, in which the word ‘sentence’ designates (as we discover
by looking up the top of page 10) ‘the sentence on top of page 10 of
this book is false’. Denote the sentence just quoted by p; then p is
true if and only if the sentence on top of page 10 of this book is
false, i.e. p is true if and only if p is false. But if ‘p is false’
merely declares that the speaker denies acceptance to p then ‘p is
false’ is not a sentence and the paradox does not arise, for there is
then no sentence to be found on top of page 10 of the book in
question.</p>
<p>The fact that we can eliminate an infinite regress and a notorious
self-contradiction, by reinterpreting the expressions ‘p is true’ and ‘p
is false’ as expressing an act of assertion or doubt, substantially
strengthens this interpretation. By generalizing our distinction between
the confident use of language for primary purposes, and the class of
expressions which merely endorse our confidence in what we have said, a
whole range of persistent philosophic problems can be eliminated.4</p>
