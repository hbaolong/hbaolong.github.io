<h4 id="commitment">10. COMMITMENT</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Cf. p. 171.</p></li>
<li><p>Bertrand Russell, The Problems of Philosophy, 4th edn., London,
1919, p. 202: ‘. . . a belief is true when there is a corresponding
fact, and is false when there is no corresponding fact’. Cf. Human
Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits, London, 1948, pp. 164–70. p. 170:
‘Every belief which is not merely an impulse to action is in the nature
of a picture, combined with a yes-feeling or a no-feeling; in the case
of a yes-feeling it is “true” if there is a fact having to the picture
the kind of similarity that a prototype has to an image; in the case of
a no-feeling it is “true” if there is no such fact. A belief which is
not true is called “false”. This is a definition of “truth” and
“falsehood”.’</p></li>
<li><p>R. B. Braithwaite, Scientific Explanation, Cambridge, 1953.
pp. 278 ff.</p></li>
<li><p>The following examples may illustrate the vagueness of this
position. F. Waismann, ‘Verifiability’, in A. Flew, Logic and Language,
I (Oxford, 1951), pp. 142–3: ‘The way we single out one particular law
from infinitely many possible ones shows that in our theoretical
construction of reality we are guided by certain principles—regulative
principles as we may call them. If I were asked what these principles
are, I should tentatively list the following: (1) Simplicity or
economy—the demand that the laws should be as simple as possible. (2)
Demands suggested by the requirements of the symbolism we use—for
instance, that the graph should represent an analytic function so as to
lend itself readily to the carrying out of certain mathematical
operations such as differentiation. (3) Aesthetic principles
(“mathematical harmony” as envisaged by Pythagoras, Kepler, Einstein)
though it is difficult to say what they are. (4) A principle which so
regulates the formation of our concepts that as many alternatives as
possible become decidable. This tendency is embodied in the whole
structure of Aristotelian logic, especially in the law of excluded
middle. (5) There is a further factor elusive and most difficult to pin
down: a mere tone of thought which, though not explicitly stated,
permeates the air of a historical period and inspires its leading
figures. It is a sort of field organizing and directing the ideas of an
age . . .’ Or Cf. H. Feigl on ‘Induction and Probability’ (H. Feigl and
W. Sellars, Readings in Philosophical Analysis, New York, 1949, p. 302);
where it is argued that there is no problem of induction because the
principle of induction is not a proposition at all, but ‘a principle of
procedure, a regulative maxim, an operational rule’. This is also the
conclusion of Bertrand Russell’s Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits
(London, 1948, Part Six, ch. 2), where the premisses of science turn out
to be a set of pre-suppositions neither empirical nor logically
necessary. I have criticized this vagueness before (on p. 113). Explicit
premisses of science are maxims, that can be acknowledged as such only
as part of a commitment endorsing the scientist’s vision of reality
(pp. 160–70 above).</p></li>
<li><p>The medieval principle of saving the phemonena by a theory
without commitment to its truth was, as we have seen, rejected by Kepler
on these very grounds (p. 146).</p></li>
<li><p>In France, during the revolutionary period, judges were obliged
to refer back to the legislature all matters not covered by statute, but
this practice was abolished in 1804. Subsequently, the doctrine gained
general acceptance that courts of law are competent to decide every case
brought before them, by applying the Code in conjunction with the legal
principles embodied in the Code. (Cf. J. W. Jones, Historical
Introduction to the Theory of the Law, Oxford, 1940.)</p></li>
<li><p>In Freud’s terms the subjective person is the appetitive id,
controlled by the prudent ego. The responsible person is explained away
by Freud as the outcome of interiorized social pressures, actuated from
inside by the super-ego. This interpretation overlooks the fact that a
responsible personhood, which curbs both the id and the ego, may at the
same time rebel against the ruling orthodoxy, and that this is precisely
where its presence is most impressively manifested. To accept moral
conscience as the interiorization of social pressure renders nonsensical
the very idea of respect being paid, or even due, by society to the
conscience of its members. A super-ego cannot be free, and to demand
liberty for it would be farcical. As to the Freudian interpretation of
intellectual passions as a sublimation of appetite drives, it leaves
unaccounted for everything that distinguishes science and art from the
instincts of which these are supposed to be sublimates. ‘Sublimation’ is
a circumlocution which relies for its meaning entirely on our previous
understanding of the things which it is supposed to explain.</p></li>
<li><p>Salvador de Madariaga, in his Christopher Columbus (London,
1939), argues the case for Columbus’ having seen, and surreptitiously
copied, Toscanelli’s map during his stay in Portugal. He also describes
Columbus’ reliance on the Apocryphal writer Esdras, who believed that
the world is ‘six parts dry land and one part sea’. ‘Toscanelli, for
Colon,’ Madariaga writes, ‘was on the way to truth, but as he had not
read Esdras his plan still required mariners, not used to losing sight
of land, to navigate 130° of 62-1/2 miles, i.e. 8125 miles over unknown
seas. Colon, through his study of Esdras, “knew” that the distance was
only 2550 miles’ (p. 101).</p></li>
<li><p>Cf. e.g. E. S. and F. R. Robinson, General Psychology, Chicago,
1926, p. 242 (cornice and steps). R. H. Wheeler, Science of Psychology,
1929, London, p. 358 (‘the falling cube’ and ‘vase and faces’).</p></li>
<li><p>This aspect of decision making was first formalized by A. Wald,
Annals of Mathem. Statistics, 16 (1945), p. 117, The simplest case is
that a null hypothesis H0 is to be tested by collecting random samples.
At each new test a threefold decision is to be made, namely (1) to
accept H0 or (2) to reject H0 or (3) to continue the experiment. You fix
a value α for the maximum tolerable probability of rejecting H0 though
H0 is true. You go on testing till the actual probability of committing
this error falls below α. If you pre-assign an unreasonably small value
for α you are incurring unreasonable costs in time and effort; if you
fix α at zero you maximize unreason.</p></li>

Grund von Dressurversuchen’, Lotos, 67/8 (1916–20), p. 168.</p></li>
<li><p>This class is subdivided in Part Four, by separating mere
incoherence from systematically pursued misinterpretations.</p></li>
<li><p>Sir James Jeans, Science and Music, Cambridge, 1937, pp. 184–5,
quotes Helmholtz as saying, ‘When I go from my justly intoned harmonium
to a grand pianoforte, every note of the latter sounds false and
disturbing. . . . On the organ, it is considered inevitable that, when
the mixture stops are played in full chords, a hellish row must ensue,
and organists have submitted to their fate. Now this is mainly due to
equal temperament, because every chord furnishes at once both
equally-tempered and justly-intoned fifths and thirds, and the result is
a restless blurred confusion of sounds.’ Cf. Max Planck, Scientific
Autobiography and Other Papers, London, 1950, pp. 26–7: ‘. . . Even in a
harmonic major triad, the natural third sounds feeble and inexpressive
in comparison with the tempered third. Indubitably, this fact can be
ascribed ultimately to a habituation through years and
generations.’</p></li>

training of perceptual judgment, see Eleanor J. Gibson, ‘Improvement in
Perceptual Judgments as a Function of Controlled Practice or Training’,
Psychological Bulletin, 1 (1953), pp. 401–31. Mrs. Gibson’s report
recounts ample experimental evidence of the improvement of sensuous
discrimination by training.</p></li>
