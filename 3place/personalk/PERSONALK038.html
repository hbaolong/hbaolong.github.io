<h4 id="mathematical-heuristics">12. MATHEMATICAL HEURISTICS</h4>
<p>There are three major fields of knowledge in which discoveries are
possible: natural science, technology and mathematics. I have referred
to examples from each of these fields to illustrate the anticipatory
powers which guide discovery. These are clearly quite similar in all
three cases. Yet the efforts of philosophers have been almost wholly
concentrated on the process of empirical discovery which underlies the
natural sciences—i.e. on an attempt to define and justify the process of
induction, while by contrast, nobody seems to have tried to define and
justify the process by which technical innovations are made, as for
example when a new machine is invented. The process of discovery in
mathematics had received some attention, and has recently been attacked
both from the logical and psychological point of view, but neither
approach has raised any epistemological questions parallel to those so
sedulously pursued for centuries in connection with empirical induction.
It seems to me that any serious attempt to analyse the process of
discovery should be sufficiently general to apply to all three fields of
systematic knowledge, and I should like to contribute to this programme
here by identifying and acknowledging the powers on which we rely in
solving mathematical problems. I shall exclude for the moment the
history of major discoveries which involve modifications in the
foundations of mathematics and shall attend only to the type of problems
that are set to students in teaching them mathematics. Since the
solution of these problems is not known to the student, the process of
finding it bears the marks of a discovery, even though it involves no
fundamental change of outlook.</p>
<p>The fact that the teaching of mathematics relies to a large extent on
practice shows that even this most highly formalized branch of knowledge
can be acquired only by developing an art. This is true not only of
mathematics and formal logic, but equally also of all mathematical
sciences, like mechanics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics and the
mathematical branches of engineering; you cannot master any of these
subjects without working out concrete problems in them. The skill you
strive for in all these cases is that of converting a language, which
you so far had assimilated only receptively, into an effective tool for
handling new subjects—and more particularly in mathematics, for solving
problems.</p>
<p>Since the solving of mathematical problems is a heuristic act which
leaps across a logical gap, any rules that can be laid down for its
guidance can be but vague maxims, the interpretation of which must rely
on the very art to which they apply. We shall see that such is indeed
the case.82</p>
<p>The simplest heuristic effort is to search for an object you have
mislaid. When I am looking for my fountain pen I know what I expect to
find; I can name it and describe it. Though I know much more about my
fountain pen than I can ever recall, I do not know exactly where I left
it; but the pen is clearly known to me and I know also that it is
somewhere within a certain region though I do not know where. I have
much less knowledge of the thing I am looking for when I am searching
for a word to fit into a crossword puzzle. This time I know only that
the missing word has a certain number of letters and designates, for
example, something that is badly needed in the Sahara or flows out of a
central chimney. These characteristics are merely clues to a word that I
definitely do not know: clues from which I must try to gain an
intimation of what the unknown word may be. Again, a name which I know
well but cannot recall at the moment, lies somewhere halfway between
these two cases. It is more closely present to my mind than the unknown
solution of a crossword puzzle, but less closely perhaps than the
mislaid fountain pen and its unknown location. Mathematical problems are
in the class of crossword puzzles, for to solve such a problem we must
find (or construct) something that we have never seen before, with the
given data serving us as clues to it.</p>
<p>A problem may admit of a systematic solution. By ransacking my flat
inch by inch, I may make sure of eventually finding my fountain pen
which I know to be somewhere in it. I might solve a chess problem by
trying out mechanically all combinations of possible moves and
countermoves. Systematic methods apply also to many mathematical
problems, though usually they are far too laborious to be carried out in
practice.83 It is clear that any such systematic operation would reach a
solution without crossing a logical gap and would not constitute a
heuristic act.84</p>
<p>The difference between the two kinds of problem solving, the
systematic and the heuristic, reappears in the fact that while a
systematic operation is a wholly deliberate act, a heuristic process is
a combination of active and passive stages. A deliberate heuristic
activity is performed during the stage of Preparation. If this is
followed by a period of Incubation, nothing is done and nothing happens
on the level of consciousness during this time. The advent of a happy
thought (whether following immediately from Preparation or only after an
interval of Incubation) is the fruit of the investigator’s earlier
efforts, but not in itself an action on his part; it just happens to
him. And again, the testing of the ‘happy thought’ by a former process
of Verification is another deliberate action of the investigator. Even
so, the decisive act of discovery must have occurred before this, at the
moment when the happy thought emerged.</p>
<p>Though the solution of a problem is something we have never met
before, yet in the heuristic process it plays a part similar to the
mislaid fountain pen or the forgotten name which we know quite well. We
are looking for it as if it were there, pre-existent. Problems set to
students are of course known to have a solution; but the belief that
there exists a hidden solution which we may be able to find is essential
also in envisaging and working at a never yet solved problem. It
determines also the manner in which the ‘happy thought’ eventually
presents itself as something inherently satisfying. It is not one among
a great many ideas to be pondered upon at leisure, but one which carries
conviction from the start. We shall see in a moment, from a closer
analysis of this process, that this is a necessary consequence of the
way a heuristic striving evokes its own consummation.</p>
<p>A problem is an intellectual desire (a ‘quasi-need’ in K. Lewin’s
terminology) and like every desire it postulates the existence of
something that can satisfy it; in the case of a problem its satisfier is
its solution. As all desire stimulates the imagination to dwell on the
means of satisfying it, and is stirred up in its turn by the play of the
imagination it has fostered, so also by taking interest in a problem we
start speculating about its possible solution and in doing so become
further engrossed in the problem.</p>
<p>Obsession with one’s problem is in fact the mainspring of all
inventive power. Asked by his pupils in jest what they should do to
become ‘a Pavlov’, the master answered in all seriousness: ’Get up in
the morning with your problem before you. Breakfast with it. Go to the
laboratory with it. Eat your lunch with it. Keep it before you after
dinner. Go to bed with it in your mind. Dream about it.’85 It is this
unremitting preoccupation with his problem that lends to genius its
proverbial capacity for taking infinite pains. And the intensity of our
preoccupation with a problem generates also our power for reorganizing
our thoughts successfully, both during the hours of search and
afterwards, during a period of rest.86</p>
<p>But what is the object of this intensive preoccupation? How can we
concentrate our attention on something we don’t know? Yet this is
precisely what we are told to do: ‘Look at the unknown!’—says
Polya—’Look at the end. Remember your aim. Do not lose sight of what is
required. Keep in mind what you are working for. Look at the unknown.
Look at the conclusion.’87 No advice could be more emphatic.</p>
<p>The seeming paradox is resolved by the fact that even though we have
never met the solution, we have a conception of it in the same sense as
we have a conception of a forgotten name. By directing our attention on
a focus in which we are subsidiarily aware of all the particulars that
remind us of the forgotten name, we form a conception of it; and
likewise, by fixing our attention on a focus in which we are
subsidiarily aware of the data by which the solution of a problem is
determined, we form a conception of this solution. The admonition to
look at the unknown really means that we should look at the known data,
but not in themselves, rather as clues to the unknown; as pointers to it
and parts of it. We should strive persistently to feel our way towards
an understanding of the manner in which these known particulars hang
together, both mutually and with the unknown. By such intimations do we
make sure that the unknown is really there, essentially determined by
what is known about it, and able to satisfy all the demands made on it
by the problem.</p>
<p>All our conceptions have heuristic powers; they are ever ready to
identify novel instances of experience by modifying themselves so as to
comprise them. The practice of skills is inventive; by concentrating our
purpose on the achievement of success we evoke ever new capacities in
ourselves. A problem partakes of both these types of endeavour. It is a
conception of something we are striving for. It is an intellectual
desire for crossing a logical gap on the other side of which lies the
unknown, fully marked out by our conception of it, though as yet never
seen in itself. The search for a solution consists in casting about with
this purpose in mind. This we do by performing two operations which must
always be tried jointly. We must (1) set out the problem in suitable
symbols and continuously reorganize its representation with a view to
eliciting some new suggestive aspects of it, and concurrently (2)
ransack our memory for any similar problem of which the solution is
known.88 The scope of these two operations will usually be limited by
the student’s technical facility for transforming the given data in
different ways, and by the range of germane theorems with which he is
acquainted. But his success will depend ultimately on his capacity for
sensing the presence of yet unrevealed logical relations between the
conditions of the problem, the theorems known to him, and the unknown
solution he is looking for. Unless his casting about is guided by a
reliable sense of growing proximity to the solution, he will make no
progress towards it. Conjectures made at random, even though following
the best rules of heuristics, would be hopelessly inept and totally
fruitless.</p>
<p>The process of solving a mathematical problem continues to depend,
therefore, at every stage on the same ability to anticipate a hidden
potentiality which will enable the student first to see a problem and
then to set out to solve it. Polya has compared a mathematical discovery
consisting of a whole chain of consecutive steps with an arch, where
every stone depends for its stability on the presence of others, and he
pointed out the paradox that the stones are in fact put in one at a
time. Again, the paradox is resolved by the fact that each successive
step of the incomplete solution is upheld by the heuristic anticipation
which originally evoked its invention: by the feeling that its emergence
has narrowed further the logical gap of the problem.</p>
<p>The growing sense of approaching to the solution of a problem can be
commonly experienced, as I said above, when we grope for a forgotten
name. We all know the exciting sense of increasing proximity to the
missing word, which we may confidently express by saying: ‘I shall
remember it in a moment’ and perhaps later ‘It is on the tip of my
tongue’. The expectation expressed by such words is often confirmed by
the event. I believe that we should likewise acknowledge our capacity
both to sense the accessibility of a hidden inference from given
premises, and to invent transformations of the premises which increase
the accessibility of the hidden inference. We should recognize that this
foreknowledge biasses our guesses in the right direction, so that their
probability of hitting the mark, which would otherwise be zero, becomes
so high that we can definitely rely on it simply on the ground of a
student’s intelligence; or for higher performances, on the ground of the
special gifts possessed by the professional mathematician.</p>
<p>The feeling that the logical gap separating us from the solution of a
problem has been reduced, means that less work should remain to be done
for solving it. It may also mean that the rest of the solution will be
comparatively easy, or that it may present itself without further effort
on our part, after a period of repose. The fact that our intellectual
strivings make effective progress during a period of Incubation without
any effort on our part is in line with the latent character of all
knowledge. As we continuously know a great many things without always
thinking of them, so we naturally also keep on desiring or fearing all
manner of things without always thinking of them. We know how a set
purpose may automatically result in action later on, as when we go to
bed resolved to wake up at a certain hour. Post-hypnotic suggestions can
set going latent processes which compulsively result after a number of
hours in the performance requested of the subject.89 Mrs. Zeigarnik has
shown that unfinished tasks continue likewise to preoccupy us
unconsciously; their memory persists after finished tasks are
forgotten.90 The fact that the tension set up by the unfinished task
continues to make progress towards its fulfilment, is shown by the well
known experience of athletes that a period of rest following on a spell
of intensive training produces an improvement of skill. The spontaneous
success of the search for a forgotten name or for the solution of a
problem, after a period of quiescence, falls in line with this
experience.</p>
<p>These antecedents explain also the manner in which the final success
of problem solving will suddenly set in. For each step—whether
spontaneous or contrived—that brings us nearer to the solution,
increases our premonition of the solution’s proximity and brings a more
concentrated effort to bear on a reduced logical gap. The last stage of
the solution may therefore be frequently achieved in a self-accelerating
manner and the final discovery may be upon us in a flash.</p>
<p>I have said that our heuristic cravings imply, like our bodily
appetites, the existence of something which has the properties required
to satisfy us, and that the intimations which guide our striving express
this belief. But the satisfier of our craving has in this case no bodily
existence; it is not a hidden object, but an idea never yet conceived.
We hope that as we work at the problem this idea will come to us,
whether all at once or bit by bit; and only if we believe that this
solution exists can we passionately search for it and evoke from
ourselves heuristic steps towards its discovery. Therefore, as it
emerges in response to our search for something we believe to be there,
discovery, or supposed discovery, will always come to us with the
conviction of its being true. It arrives accredited in advance by the
heuristic craving which evoked it.</p>
<p>The most daring feats of originality are still subject to this law:
they must be performed on the assumption that they origina nothing, but
merely reveal what is there. And their triumph confirms this assumption,
for what has been found bears the mark of reality in being pregnant with
yet unforeseeable implications. Mathematical heuristics, though aiming
at conceptual reorganization without reference to new experience, once
more exemplifies in its own terms that an intellectual striving entails
its conviction of anticipating reality. It illustrates also how this
conviction finds itself confirmed by the eventual solution, which
‘solves’ precisely because it successfully claims to reveal an aspect of
reality. And we can see once more also, how the whole process of
discovery and confirmation ultimately relies on our own accrediting of
our own vision of reality.</p>
<p>To start working on a mathematical problem, we reach for pencil and
paper, and throughout the stage of Preparation we keep trying out ideas
on paper in terms of symbolic operations. If this does not lead straight
to success, we may have to think the whole matter over again, and may
perhaps see the solution revealed unexpectedly much later in a moment of
Illumination. Actually, however, such a flash of triumph usually offers
no final solution, but only the envisagement of a solution which has yet
to be tested. In the verification or working out of the solution we must
again rely therefore on explicit symbolic operations. Thus both the
first active steps undertaken to solve a problem and the final garnering
of the solution rely effectively on computations and other symbolic
operations, while the more informal act by which the logical gap is
crossed lies between these two formal procedures. However, the intuitive
powers of the investigator are always dominant and decisive. Good
mathematicians are usually found capable of carrying out computations
quickly and reliably, for unless they command this technique they may
fail to make their ingenuity effective—but their ingenuity itself lies
in producing ideas. Hadamard says that he used to make more mistakes in
calculation than his own pupils, but that he more quickly discovered
them because the result did not look right; it is almost as if by his
computations he had been merely drawing a portrait of his conceptually
prefigured conclusions.91 Gauss is widely quoted as having said: ‘I have
had my solutions for a long time but I do not yet know how I am to
arrive at them.’ Though the quotation may be doubtful it remains well
said.92 A situation of this kind certainly prevails every time we
discover what we believe to be the solution to a problem. At that moment
we have the vision of a solution which looks right and which we are
therefore confident to prove right.93</p>
<p>The manner in which the mathematician works his way towards
discovery, by shifting his confidence from intuition to computation and
back again from computation to intuition, while never releasing his hold
on either of the two, represents in miniature the whole range of
operations by which articulation disciplines and expands the reasoning
powers of man. This alternation is asymmetrical, for a formal step can
be valid only by virtue of our tacit confirmation of it. Moreover, a
symbolic formalism is itself but an embodiment of our antecedent
unformalized powers—an instrument skilfully contrived by our
inarticulate selves for the purpose of relying on it as our external
guide. The interpretation of primitive terms and axioms is therefore
predominantly inarticulate, and so is the process of their expansion and
re-interpretation which underlies the progress of mathematics. The
alternation between the intuitive and the formal depends on tacit
affirmations, both at the beginning and at the end of each chain of
formal reasoning.</p>
