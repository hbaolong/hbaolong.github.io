<h4 id="order">3. ORDER</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A small probability of all chance events having happened exactly
as they did, arises from fictitiously attributing significance to the
precise way in which the events happened. An important instance of this
fallacy has gained currency under the authority of Sir Ronald Fisher
(see his ‘Retrospect of Criticisms of Natural Selection’ in Huxley,
Hardy and Ford, Evolution as a Process, London, 1954, pp. 91–2), who
used it in defence of the theory of natural selection against the
objection that the probability of the evolutionary process having
occurred by random mutations is prohibitively small. He argues that by
the same token the chances of any man having descended through a
thousand ancestral generations could be rejected as much too improbable,
since the probability of one ancestral individual having a descendant in
the thousandth succeeding generation can be shown to be infinitesimal.
However, nothing distinctive is known about the thousandth ancestor of a
man, and the question as to the probability of his having descended from
any particular ancestor is therefore without foundation. The degree of
chance involved in the chain of procreation, which produced any
particular individual, is the probability of any member of the
thousandth ancestral generation producing a descendant in our own day.
And this probability is—in the light of Sir Ronald Fisher’s own
calculations—quite enough. I have illustrated the principles involved
here by the example of the pebbles in the station garden at Abergele.
One may reasonably ask what the probability was for the pebbles having
arranged themselves by chance to form an English sentence, but it is
unreasonable to ask what the chances were for them to become scattered
in a particular way; for when they are scattered at random they do not
form a pattern. The theory of natural selection claims to explain the
formation of certain significant patterns and not the formation of a
particular random collocation of atoms.</p></li>
<li><p>The conception of a significant pattern used in this chapter
excludes the orderly distribution of averages; the reasons for assigning
these random features to an essentially different class will be
explained in chapter 13.</p></li>
<li><p>In designing an experiment we must try to discriminate against
irrelevant features by making sure that they vary at random. In
agricultural experiments sites may be assigned by the tossing of a coin.
(R. A. Fisher, The Design of Experiments, London, 1935, p. 48.)</p></li>
<li><p>Thus we arrive first at the definition of alternative
probabilities and secondly at an identification of these with relative
frequencies. All attempts at deriving, on the contrary, alternative
probabilities from relative frequencies have turned out to be logically
unsound, for the statements of frequencies are themselves probability
statements. This objection would be met if frequencies could be defined
in unambiguous terms, but that is self-contradictory (see Part Four,
ch. 13). For a more detailed presentation of the following argument see
my paper ‘On Biassed Coins and Related Subjects’ in Zs. f. Phys. Chem.
(1958).</p></li>
<li><p>See Part Four, ch. 13, p. 15.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment 3 shows that the effect of a bias tends to disappear
at higher temperatures, and will vanish correspondingly also under the
effect of more violent shaking. Note that the energy Et required for
causing a die to tumble over should always be large compared with ΔE, so
that even at the higher temperatures KT may be kept well below Et. We
should have Et kT ΔE; and this should apply correspondingly also to the
conditions of ‘more violent shaking’. Otherwise the die will keep
rolling all the time.</p></li>
<li><p>The principal scope of thermodynamics lies in variable
combinations between the operations of ordering principles according to
Experiment 2 and of the counteracting randomizing effect of thermal
motion as exemplified in Experiment 3. But these combinations may be
disregarded for our present purpose.</p></li>

numbers of individuals with alternative inheritable characters (1866)
was similarly confirmed by the genic structure of chromosomes about half
a century later.</p></li>
