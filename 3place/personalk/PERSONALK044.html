<h4 id="the-premisses-of-science">6. THE PREMISSES OF SCIENCE</h4>
<p>At this point we may enquire how far the controversial principles in
question may be regarded as the premisses of science. Can science be
said to rest on specifiable presuppositions, be it on rules of correct
procedure or on substantial beliefs about the nature of things? I shall
put the matter first in the light of my own views, based on reflections
of the kind made in the course of the foregoing survey. We have seen how
perilously poised is the balance between the intrinsic claims of a
subject matter, and the passion for exactitude and coherence, e.g. in
the scientific study of sentient beings; how the tendency towards a
universal mechanistic conception of things may threaten completely to
denature our image of man. We have seen other examples too, in the work
of Kepler and Einstein, to show how the most powerful visions of
scientific truth may reveal later elements of fundamental error. I have
mentioned a series of great speculative discoveries which eloquently
testified to the veridical powers of intellectual beauty, and have shown
at the same time how frequently such discoveries may remain unrecognized
by the most expert judges, and that no one—not even their authors—can
even remotely discern at first what they imply. The delicate character
of the criteria which characterize scientific value was brought home
further by the great scientific controversies of the past. We have seen
that the outcome of these controversies—together with the result of
other upheavals in science—have laid down these criteria for us today,
though in the last resort it still remains for us to decide how far we
shall accept or modify these interpretations. For in the history of
science, as in that of all other human activities, it falls finally to
him who tells their story, to endorse or revise all previous assessments
of their outcome—while simultaneously responding to contemporary issues
unthought of before. Traditions are transmitted to us from the past, but
they are our own interpretations of the past, at which we have arrived
within the context of our own immediate problems.</p>
<p>The general criteria of scientific value to be derived from the
historic instances I have considered, may be tentatively regarded as a
fair sample of the premisses of science. Copernicus and his opponents;
Kepler and Einstein; Laplace and John Dalton; Hegel and Bode; de Broglie
and Dirac; van’t Hoff and Kolbe; Liebig and Pasteur; Elliotson and
Braid; Freud, Eddington, Rhine and Lysenko; all these and countless
other scientists, or persons claiming to be scientists, have held
certain allegedly ‘scientific’ beliefs about the nature of things and
the proper method and purpose of scientific enquiry. These beliefs and
valuations have indicated to their adherents the kind of questions which
seem reasonable and interesting to explore. They have recommended the
kind of conceptions and relations that should be upheld as plausible,
even when some evidence seemed to contradict them; or which, on the
contrary, should be rejected as unlikely, even though there was evidence
which seemed to favour them and which could not be readily explained on
other grounds.</p>
<p>The rules of scientific procedure which we adopt, and the scientific
beliefs and valuations which we hold, are mutually determined. For we
proceed according to what we expect to be the case and we shape our
anticipations in accordance with the success which our methods of
procedure have met with. Beliefs and valuations have accordingly
functioned as joint premisses in the pursuit of scientific enquiries.
But how exactly should they be defined in this relation? We might be
inclined to acknowledge as its premisses the general views and purposes
bearing on a future scientific enquiry. But ‘premiss’ is a logical
category: it refers to an affirmation which is logically anterior to
that of which it is the premiss. Accordingly, the general views and
purposes implicit in the achievement and establishment of a scientific
discovery are its premisses, even though these views and purposes may no
longer be quite the same as those held before the investigation was
first seriously thought of. This paradoxical sense seems to be the only
one in which we can envisage any premisses of science. But let me first
elaborate the same principle briefly in respect to everyday
knowledge.</p>
<p>Natural science deals with facts borrowed largely from common
experience. The methods by which we establish facts in everyday life are
therefore logically anterior to the special premisses of science, and
should be included in a full statement of these premisses. The standards
of intellectual satisfaction which urge and guide our eyes to gather
what there is to see, and which guide our thoughts also to shape our
conception of things—the beliefs about the nature of things transmitted
by our everyday descriptive language—all these form part of the
premisses of science, even though we must allow for the revision of
these standards and beliefs within science. On the other hand, the
assumption of persistent features in nature is certainly not a
sufficient premiss for the establishment of natural science. It gives us
grounds for referring to facts and for thinking of the universe as an
aggregate of facts. But factuality is not science. Only a comparatively
few peculiar facts are scientific facts, while the enormous rest are
without scientific interest. Hence principles like that of the
Uniformity of Nature (J. S. Mill), or that of Limited Variety (J. M.
Keynes), which may account for factuality, cannot account by themselves
for natural science. Astrology and magic rely as much on the Uniformity
of Nature or on its Limited Variety as do the natural sciences, even
though science repudiates the facts alleged by astrologers and medicine
men.</p>
<p>I have said that the premisses of science are tacitly observed in the
practice of scientific pursuits and in the acceptance of their results
as true. This is true also of the Uniformity of Nature or of its Limited
Variety. Indeed, it is only by our common acquaintance with facts, which
either persist for a while on a single occasion, or keep recurring at
different places and times, that we can appreciate what is meant by
Uniformity or Limited Variety in Nature. These conceptions would be
quite unintelligible to us if we lived in a gaseous universe, in which
no circumscribed or recurrent facts could ever be discerned. The logical
premisses of factuality are not known to us or believed by us before we
start establishing facts, but are recognized on the contrary by
reflecting on the way we establish facts. Our acceptance of facts which
make sense of the clues offered by experience to our eyes and ears must
be presupposed first, and the premisses underlying this process of
making sense must be deduced from this afterwards. Since the process of
discovering the logical antecedent from an analysis of its logical
derivate cannot fail to introduce a measure of uncertainty, the
knowledge of this antecedent will always be less certain than that of
its consequent. We do not believe in the existence of facts because of
our anterior and securer belief in any explicit logical presuppositions
of such a belief; but on the contrary, we believe in certain explicit
presuppositions of factuality only because we have discovered that they
are implied in our belief in the existence of facts.</p>
<p>The same peculiar logical structure will be seen to apply to the more
specific premisses of science and indeed, far beyond these, to the
logical antecedents of all informal mental processes, some of which
enter into every rational act of man. The simplest illustration of this
structure is given in the practice of skills like swimming, cycling or
playing the piano; to recall my analysis of them will strip the
foregoing formulation of its paradoxical features. Swimming may be said
to presuppose the principle of keeping afloat by retaining an excessive
residue of air in the lungs; and we can state certain operational
principles of cycling and piano playing which can likewise be regarded
as the premisses underlying these performances. But we have seen that we
achieve and practise these skills without any antecedent focal knowledge
of their premisses. Indeed, the premisses of a skill cannot be
discovered focally prior to its performance, nor even understood if
explicitly stated by others, before we ourselves have experienced its
performance, whether by watching it or by engaging in it ourselves. In
performing a skill we are therefore acting on certain premisses of which
we are focally ignorant, but which we know subsidiarily as part of our
mastery of that skill, and which we may get to know focally by analysing
the way we achieve success (or what we believe to be success) in the
skill in question. The rules of success which we thus derive can help us
to improve our skill and to teach it to others—but only if these
principles are first re-integrated into the art of which they are the
maxims. For though no art can be exercised according to its explicit
rules, such rules can be of great assistance to an art if observed
subsidiarily within the context of its skilful performance.45</p>
<p>We can accordingly amend our previous formulation as follows. The
logical antecedents of an informal mental process like fact finding, or
more particularly, the finding of a fact of science, come to be known
subsidiarily in the very act of their application; but they can become
known focally only later, from an analysis of their application, and,
once focally known, they can be applied by re-integration to guide
subsidiarily improved performances of the process.</p>
<p>The first step towards establishing the premisses of a mental
achievement like science—or music, or law, etc.—is, therefore, to
acknowledge its authentic instances. We do not accept every allegation
of a fact as true, nor can we acknowledge every intended contribution to
science, or music, or law, as part of true science, or music, or law.
The question, which ‘facts’ are facts, what ‘science’ is science, what
‘music’ is music, what ‘law’ is law, may indeed be highly controversial.
In order to elucidate the assumptions underlying the establishment of
facts, and particularly of the facts of science, we must take a stand on
such doubtful issues. For we must reflect on facts and parts of science
which we acknowledge as valid, or at least on facts and parts of science
which we regard as competently alleged, even if not validly established.
I would accept, for example, the statement that according to the facts
as known to Kepler the number of planets was six, though this is not the
fact according to our own knowledge; and I acknowledge Pythagorean
speculations as part of Kepler’s scientific work, even though I do not
believe them to be correct; while at the same time I reject Kepler’s
horoscopes and all his astrology as incompetent, both as statements of
fact and as scientific work.</p>
<p>Any attempt to define the body of science more closely comes up
against the fact that the knowledge comprised by science is not known to
any single person. Indeed, nobody knows more than a tiny fragment of
science well enough to judge its validity and value at first hand. For
the rest he has to rely on views accepted at second hand on the
authority of a community of people accredited as scientists. But this
accrediting depends in its turn on a complex organization. For each
member of the community can judge at first hand only a small number of
his fellow members, and yet eventually each is accredited by all. What
happens is that each recognizes as scientists a number of others by whom
he is recognized as such in return, and these relations form chains
which transmit these mutual recognitions at second hand through the
whole community. This is how each member becomes directly or indirectly
accredited by all. The system extends into the past. Its members
recognize the same set of persons as their masters and derive from this
allegiance a common tradition, of which each carries on a particular
strand.</p>
<p>This analysis of the scientific consensus will be carried further in
the next chapter, on Conviviality. Suffice it here to say that anyone
who speaks of science in the current sense and with the usual approval,
accepts this organized consensus as determining what is ‘scientific’ and
what ‘unscientific’. Every great scientific controversy tends therefore
to turn into a dispute between the established authorities and a
pretender (Elliotson, Kiitzing, Rhine, Freud, van’t Hoff, Lysenko, etc.)
who is as yet denied the status of a scientist, at least with respect to
the work under discussion.</p>
<p>These pretenders do not deny the authority of scientific opinion in
general, but merely appeal against its authority in a particular detail
and seek to modify its teachings in respect of that detail. Indeed,
every thoughtful submission to authority is qualified by some, however
slight, opposition to it. The position is similar—and closely linked—to
that already stated in respect to tradition. When I speak of science I
acknowledge both its tradition and its organized authority, and I deny
that anyone who wholly rejects these can be said to be a scientist, or
have any proper understanding and appreciation of science. Consequently,
nothing that I—who accept the traditions and authority of science—may
say about science can mean anything to such a person, and this holds
also in reverse. Yet I do not enter this commitment unconditionally, as
shown by the fact that I refuse to follow both the tradition and
authority of science in its pursuit of the objectivist ideal in
psychology and sociology. I accept the existing scientific opinion as a
competent authority, but not as a supreme authority, for identifying the
subject matter called ‘science’.</p>
<p>This distinction is implicit in the remarks I have just made about
Kepler. It is indispensable to any survey of the historic progress of
science. For to limit the term science to propositions which we regard
as valid, and the premisses of science to what we consider to be its
true premisses, is to mutilate our subject matter. A reasonable
conception of science must include conflicting views within science and
admit of changes in the fundamental beliefs and values of scientists. To
acknowledge a person as a scientist—and even as a very great
scientist—is merely to acknowledge him as competent in science, which
admits the possibility that he was, or is, in many ways mistaken.</p>
<p>I may observe then, as I have done already, that the modern physical
sciences went through three stages, each of which had its own scientific
values and its corresponding vision of ultimate reality. Scientists of
the first period believed in a system of numbers and geometrical
figures, the next in one of mechanically constrained masses, the last in
systems of mathematical invariances. In attaching themselves to the
pursuit of these successive fundamental guesses about the nature of
things, the intellectual passions of scientists underwent profound
changes—changes similar in extent, and perhaps even not unrelated, to
those which the appreciation of visual arts underwent from the Byzantine
mosaics to the works of the Impressionists and from these to Surrealism.
But there was a similar transcendence of an enduring passion in both
cases. Granted that many of the arguments of Copernicus, Galileo and
Kepler, and even of Newton, Lavoisier and Dalton, seem misguided today,
and that their presuppositions have led to conclusions which we now
consider to be false; and granted also that these giants of the past, if
they returned today, might not readily accept relativity and quantum
mechanics as satisfying systems of science; yet so much of earlier
science has remained true, and has even revealed as true ever more of
its deeper implications, that the pioneers of science have kept growing
through the centuries in our respect. In this sense then science
embraces a consistent pursuit of gradually changing, and—I believe—on
the whole, evermore enlightened and elevated intellectual
aspirations.</p>
<p>Such is the general framework within which the pursuit of science can
be defined and the assumptions underlying its achievements identified.
This perspective will have to be considerably widened—as I shall show in
Part Four—to include the biological sciences; the inclusion of
psychology and sociology would raise further, sharply controversial
questions which I shall touch upon only in passing.</p>
<p>So much for the breadth of the field. I can only hint at the kind of
detail into which any substantial investigation of the premisses
underlying scientific discovery and verification would have to go.
Perhaps it would have to examine above all the great discoveries
made—particularly in this century—by scientists speculatively pursuing
some specific guesses at a rational interpretation of nature; it would
have to consider how obscure and controversial some of these
speculations appeared at first; how many similar speculations were in
fact empty or mistaken; and yet how astoundingly true and deeply
prophetic some of them proved in several famous instances. Exceptional
sensibility would be needed in order to discover what general ideas
about the nature of things have guided these remarkable guesses. But
even so, such an account would only reveal the premisses of past
scientific achievements. The actual premisses of science, at the moment
of writing, are present only in the yet unformed discoveries maturing in
the minds of scientific investigators intent on their work. The visitor
to the research school of a great master—whose intuitive apprehensions
can filter through, even though imperfectly, to an inner circle of
collaborators—may dimly discern the premisses of prospective discoveries
by the way the collaborators talk about their work. We can get no closer
to the current premisses of science.</p>
<p>We have now before us a true image of science in the process of
emerging from initial vagueness and conjecture to greater precision and
certainty. It is here, in the course of discovery and verification, that
the premisses of science exercise their guidance over the judgment of
scientists. It is obvious that no formulation of these premisses ever
proposed (or yet to be proposed) would have enabled a person lacking the
special gifts and training of a scientist, competently to decide any of
the serious uncertainties that have arisen in the various controversial
or doubtful issues I have mentioned. Indeed, when we try to apply any of
these formulations for deciding a great question in science, we find
that they prove ambiguous precisely to the extent of allowing both
alternatives to be equally arguable.</p>
<p>Take Mach’s principle of ‘mental economy’, according to which science
is the simplest description or the most convenient summary of the facts.
Imagine the puzzled examiners of de Broglie’s doctoral thesis having
recourse to this criterion as to the scientific value of the work. How
could they? Most of the facts which the theory eventually was found to
describe were yet undiscovered. They would have had to limit themselves
to the facts known to be described by the theory. Should they have
arranged a competition to determine whether the new theory was simpler,
in the sense that it would make it easier to memorize these facts or to
teach them in schools; or that the theory could be written down in a
smaller space or in a more familiar vocabulary? The idea is farcical.
What they had to decide first and last was whether this work was a
substantial discovery or a mere jeu-d’esprit. This would decide also
whether it was the scientifically simplest description of the facts. For
as a mere conceit it was a fancifully far-fetched way of looking at
things; while as a true statement, it was an amazingly simple short-cut
to vast new perspectives.</p>
<p>Or apply the concept of ‘simplicity’ to the controversy about Rhine’s
experiments on card guessing. Extra-sensory perception is of course the
simplest explanation for them, if you are prepared to believe in
extrasensory perception. Yet most scientists today would prefer some
other explanation, however complicated, if only it lay within the scope
of hitherto known physical interactions. To them it appears more
‘economical’ not to introduce a new principle if we can possibly manage
with those already accepted; and they are even prepared to disregard
Rhine’s observations until such time as these can be fitted into the
existing framework of natural laws. Again, the question of simplicity of
description, in the ordinary sense of the word ‘simple’, plays, and can
play, no part whatsoever in the controversy. On the contrary, in
whatever way the issue is finally decided, this will determine what will
be the simpler explanation in the scientific sense.</p>
<p>This ambiguity of the term ‘simple’ within Mach’s formula follows
from the fact which I stated before,46 namely that it functions here as
a pseudo-substitute for ‘true’. In consequence, the answer to the
question what is simple in a given case must always be exactly as
doubtful as the answer to the question what is true in the same case.
The same ambiguity will adhere to other pseudo-substitutes for truth,
like the pragmatist criterion that a theory ‘works’. This ambiguity is
revealed in the same way as that of ‘simplicity’, if we apply
practicality in place of simplicity as a criterion of such doubtful or
controversial issues as de Broglie’s thesis or Rhine’s experiments. The
same test will yield similar results in respect to the criterion of
fruitfulness, of which I have already shown how grotesquely it mimics
the functions of truth.</p>
<p>I have said before (p. 161) that the premisses of science determine
the methods of its pursuit and vice versa. Yet the enquiry into
scientific procedure has in fact been conducted on separate and much
more systematic lines. Its aim has been the discovery of some strictly
formulated rule by which valid general propositions can be derived from
available empirical observations. One such scheme, based on the process
of collecting evidence which will increase the probability of an
empirical proposition to the point of practical certainty, I have fully
discussed and criticized in ch. 2. The additional material collected in
the present chapter should enable me to re-formulate that criticism, and
apply it also to all attempts made to formulate the process of induction
on the lines of J. S. Mill’s principles of Agreement and Difference.</p>
<p>Specific rules of empirical inference claim (a) to proceed by a
prescribed operation from clues to discovery or at least (b) to show how
to verify, or at the very least (c) how to falsify, an empirical
proposition according to some such rules. Claim (a) must be rejected in
view of the demonstrable fact that discovery is separated by a logical
gap from the grounds on which it is made. It is, as I said before, a
travesty of the scientific method to conceive of it as an automatic
process depending on the speed of piling up evidence for hypotheses
chosen at random (Part One, ch. 2, p. 30). The history of the great
scientific controversies teaches us now that claims (b) and (c) are
equally unfounded.</p>
<p>The reasons are similar to those I used for criticizing terms like
‘simple’ as a substitute for ‘true’. All formal rules of scientific
procedure must prove ambiguous, for they will be interpreted quite
differently, according to the particular conceptions about the nature of
things by which the scientist is guided. And his chances for reaching
true and important conclusions will depend decisively on the correctness
and penetration of these conceptions. We have seen that there is a type
of empirical discovery that is achieved without any process of
induction. De Broglie’s wave theory, the Copernican system and the
theory of Relativity, were all found by pure speculation guided by
criteria of internal rationality. The triumph of the Michelson-Morley
experiment, despite its giving the wrong result, the tragic sacrifice of
D. C. Miller’s professional life to the pursuit of purely empirical
tests of a great theoretical vision, are sardonic comments on the
supposed supremacy of experiment over theory. Admittedly, other
controversies, like those of fermentation, hypnotism and extra-sensory
perception, seem to centre altogether on questions of factual evidence.
But looking at these disputes more closely it appears that the two sides
do not accept the same ‘facts’ as facts, and still less the same
‘evidence’ as evidence. These terms are ambiguous precisely to the
extent to which the two opposing opinions differ. For within two
different conceptual frameworks the same range of experience takes the
shape of different facts and different evidence. Indeed, one side may
disregard some of the evidence altogether in the confident expectation
that it will somehow turn out to be false. I shall give further
illustrations of this power of scientific theory over scientific facts
in a later chapter (Part Three, ch. 9, ‘A Critique of Doubt’).</p>
<p>We should also remember that the rules of induction have lent their
support throughout the ages to beliefs that are contrary to those of
science. Astrology has been sustained for 3000 years by empirical
evidence confirming the predictions of horoscopes. This represents the
longest chain of historically known empirical generalizations. For many
prehistoric centuries the theories embodied in magic and witchcraft
appeared to be strikingly confirmed by events in the eyes of those who
believed in magic and witchcraft. Lecky47 rightly points out that the
destruction of belief in witchcraft during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries was achieved in the face of an overwhelming, and still rapidly
growing, body of evidence for its reality. Those who denied that witches
existed did not attempt to explain this evidence at all, but
successfully urged that it be disregarded. Glanvill, who was one of the
founders of the Royal Society, not unreasonably denounced this method as
unscientific, on the ground of the professed empiricism of contemporary
science. Some of the unexplained evidence for witchcraft was indeed
buried for good, and only struggled painfully to light two centuries
later when it was eventually recognized as the manifestation of hypnotic
powers.</p>
<p>Moreover, a whole realm of more familiar facts has been overlooked by
philosophers who strove to justify science by ascribing a unique
reliability to the inductive method.48 Constant conjunction would lead
to absurd predictions all over the enormous range of processes the
course of which is determined by decay or the satiation of appetites.
Our expectation of life does not increase with the number of days we
have survived. On the contrary, the experience of living through the
next 24 hours is much less likely to recur after it has happened 30,000
consecutive times than after only 1000 times. Attempts to train a horse
to do without food will break down precisely after the longest series of
successes; and the certainty of amusing an audience by one’s favourite
joke does not increase indefinitely with the number of its successful
repetitions. It is true that in conditioning experiments animals tend to
expect that an event which is repeatedly preceded by a sign will recur
after the sign is given again; but when children are asked to guess in a
random sequence of red and green lights appearing in two parallel rows
which of the two will come out next, they will expect that it will be
the one which has so far occurred fewer times.49 We can easily imagine a
universe in which all recurrences would be limited in number, so that
new recurrences would invariably become steadily less likely with the
number of their previous occurrences.</p>
<p>The decisive reason why such obviously inadequate formulations of the
principles of science were accepted by men of great intellectual
distinction lies in a desperate craving to represent scientific
knowledge as impersonal. We have seen that this is achieved by two
alternative recipes: (1) by describing science in terms of some
secondary feature (simplicity, economy, practicality, fruitfulness,
etc.), and (2) by setting up some formal model in terms of probabilities
or constant conjunctions. In both cases the scientist would be left
uncommitted; in the first because he would say nothing more than a
telephone directory, in the second because he would have a machine to
speak for him, impersonally. Since the latter solution still leaves over
the personal act of accrediting the machine, this act may be played down
on the lines of recipe I by describing it as a mere ‘policy’. But to
justify a scientific procedure by its practical advantage as a policy,
is to conceal the fact that this advantage is expected to accrue only
because we hold certain beliefs about the nature of things which make
this expectation reasonable.</p>
<p>I shall presently (p. 191) have more to say on the curious logical
dilemma in which any formal axiomatization of science (or mathematics)
leads itself ad absurdum. At the moment I only wish to explain how the
paramount desire for impersonal knowledge could succeed in rendering
plausible such flagrantly inadequate formulations of science as given
either by recipe 1 or 2. We owe this immense power for self-deception to
the operation of the ubiquitous tacit coefficient by which alone we can
apply any articulate terms to a subject matter described by them. These
powers enable us to evoke our conception of a complex ineffable subject
matter with which we are familiar, by even the roughest sketch of any of
its specifiable features. A scientist can accept, therefore, the most
inadequate and misleading formulation of his own scientific principles
without ever realizing what is being said, because he automatically
supplements it by his tacit knowledge of what science really is, and
thus makes the formulation ring true.</p>
<p>Since this process is essential to the mechanism of
pseudo-substitution, to which I ascribe some importance as an instrument
of a misguided critical philosophy, I shall digress on it a little
further. A most dramatic instance of self-deception, caused by the
intervention of the inarticulate powers of the observer, occurred in the
case of Clever Hans: the horse which could tap out with his hoofs the
answer to all kinds of mathematical problems, written out on a
blackboard in front of him. Incredulous experts from all relevant
branches of knowledge came and tested him severely, only to confirm
again and again his unfailing intellectual powers. But at last Mr. Oskar
Pfungst had the idea of asking the horse a question to which he,
Pfungst, did not know the answer. This time the horse went on tapping
and tapping indefinitely, without rhyme or reason. It turned out that
all the severely sceptical experts had involuntarily and unknowingly
signalled to the horse to stop tapping at the point where they—knowing
the right answer—expected him to stop.50 This is how they made the
answers invariably come out right; and this is exactly also how
philosophers make their descriptions of science, or their formalized
procedures of scientific inference, come out right. They never use them
to decide any open scientific problem, whether past or present, but
apply them to scientific generalizations which they regard as
indubitably established.51 This belief eliminates all the ambiguities
which the formal procedures of constant conjunction—or of the
progressive confirmation of hypotheses according to their increasing
probability—leave open, and thus makes either process give invariably
the right result. And again, you can successfully conceal from yourself
the unaccountable fact that you are absolutely convinced of (say) the
law of gravitation, by calling it a mere working hypothesis, or a
shorthand description of the facts, etc. For a belief which can be
touched by no shadow of a doubt remains unaffected by such
understatements. So these formulae can be safely uttered to appease a
strictly empiricist conscience. It is only when we are confronted with
the anxious dilemma of a live scientific issue, that the ambiguity of
the formal processes and of the various attenuated criteria of
scientific truth becomes apparent, and leaves us without effective
guidance.52</p>
<p>These formal criteria can of course function legitimately as maxims
of scientific value and scientific procedure. To every change in
scientific value, from Kepler to Laplace and from Laplace to Einstein,
there has corresponded a change in scientific method, which can be
formulated in changing maxims of procedure. We have seen such
legislation occurring in the past as the outcome of great controversies
and upheavals in science. They have formed the scientific tradition
which it falls to us ultimately to interpret within the context of our
own controversial issues.</p>
<p>Such is, in effect, the legitimate purpose and meaning of exploring
the logical antecedents of science. But this meaning is obscured by any
attempt at formulating these antecedents as the axiomatic
presuppositions of empirical inference. What such postulates can say is
not in itself convincing, nor indeed clearly comprehensible. They derive
their meaning and convincing power from our anterior belief in a body of
natural sciences which appears to imply their validity, and only as we
become imbued with the knowledge of natural science and learn to apply
its methods to new problems, can we learn to appreciate these postulates
as guiding principles on which we rely.</p>
<p>If we fail to realize that the logical antecedents of science are
internal to science, they will inevitably appear as propositions
accepted prior to the pursuit of science. If we then reflect on them and
find that they are not logically inescapable, we are faced with the
insoluble problem of finding a justification for them. The problem is
insoluble, for it seeks an explanation for a non-existent state of
affairs. Nobody has ever affirmed the presuppositions of science by
themselves. The discoveries of science have been achieved by the
passionately sustained efforts of succeeding generations of great men,
who overwhelmed the whole of modern humanity by the power of their
convictions. Thus has our scientific outlook been moulded, of which
these logical rules give a highly attenuated summary. If we ask why we
accept this summary, the answer lies in the body of knowledge of which
they are the summary. We must reply by recalling the way each of us has
come to accept that knowledge and the reasons for which we continue to
do so. Science will appear then as a vast system of beliefs, deeply
rooted in our history and cultivated today by a specially organized part
of our society. We shall see that science is not established by the
acceptance of a formula, but is part of our mental life, shared out for
cultivation among many thousands of specialized scientists throughout
the world, and shared receptively, at second hand, by many millions. And
we shall realize that any sincere account of the reasons for which we
too share in this mental life must necessarily be given as part of this
life.</p>
<p>Science is a system of beliefs to which we are committed. Such a
system cannot be accounted for either from experience as seen within a
different system, or by reason without any experience. Yet this does not
signify that we are free to take it or leave it, but simply reflects the
fact that it is a system of beliefs to which we are committed and which
therefore cannot be represented in non-committal terms. In leading up to
this position, the logical analysis of science decisively reveals its
own limitations and points beyond itself in the direction of a fiduciary
formulation of science, to which I propose to move on at a later stage
of this enquiry.</p>
