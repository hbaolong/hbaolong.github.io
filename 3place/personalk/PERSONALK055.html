<h4 id="pure-conviviality">4. PURE CONVIVIALITY</h4>
<p>The sentiments of trust and the persuasive passions by which the
transmission of our articulate heritage is kept flowing, bring us back
once more to the primitive sentiments of fellowship that exist previous
to articulation among all groups of men and even among animals. Evidence
of the primordial character of such conviviality and of the lively
emotions engendered and gratified by its interplay is supplied by the
experience both of animals and men.</p>
<p>A newly hatched chicken soon learns to join the flock around its
mother and to seek protection under her wings. This educational process
goes on so swiftly that it normally escapes notice, but it is clearly
revealed by the experiment of letting a chicken grow up in isolation.
When the chicken brought up in solitude is released after a fortnight,
and brought together with its sisters and brothers, which have formed a
flock around their mother, it behaves in a frantic manner. It pecks
wildly at its fellow chicks and runs around terror-stricken.9 We may say
therefore that the earliest inter-personal interaction between chickens
affects their emotions towards each other. They usually succeed in
developing a rationally balanced emotional life, which would be stunted
and deranged by artificial isolation.</p>
<p>The emotional comfort which chickens seem to enjoy when brought up in
a flock is not unrelated to the bodily satisfaction of shared warmth and
protection, but it is yet distinct from the pleasure cf mere
drive-satisfaction which an animal enjoys in finding food and shelter. A
hungry dog will jump about and bark when its meal is approaching and
this excitement has emotional colouring, but the companionship afforded
by a dog to a man, by which it may vitally participate in his existence,
is rooted in richer and more disinterested passions. Indeed, a dog will
attach its affection to a master who plays with it, goes for walks with
it and generally shows interest in it, rather than to the person who
feeds it.10 The comprehensive scope of convivial relations has been
expressed by Köhler in the aphorism that a solitary chimpanzee is not a
chimpanzee. All its physical needs are satisfied, yet it languishes
through emotional starvation. It lacks that sharing and interplay of
life between fellow animals, the manifold forms of which are reflected
in a whole gamut of varied sentiments.</p>
<p>Companionship among men is often sustained and enjoyed in silence.
Mr. Utterson, in Stevenson’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, puts off any
business, however important, to take his regular walk with his friend
Mr. Richard Enfield, during which neither of them pronounces a single
word. But conviviality is usually made effective by a more deliberate
sharing of experience, and most commonly by conversation. The exchange
of greetings and of conventional remarks is an articulation of
companionship, and every articulate address of one person to another
makes some contribution to their conviviality, in the sense of their
reaching out to each other and sharing each other’s lives. Pure
conviviality, that is, the cultivation of good fellowship, predominates
in many acts of communication; indeed, the main reason for which people
talk to each other is a desire for company.11 The torment of solitary
confinement is that it deprives one not of information but of
conversation, however uninformative.</p>
<p>The fostering of good fellowship within small groups of people living
together, be it as families, as school-fellows, as shipmates, as fellow
members of a congregation or of a workshop or office team, is a direct
contribution to the fulfilment of man’s purpose and duty as a social
being. But the process is also of practical use in making the joint
activities of the group more effective. Naval commanders know that the
crew of a happy ship will fight well. Industrial psychologists have
observed that the output of a workshop increases when its operatives
find pleasure in each other’s company.12 Many are the instances in which
the improvement of conviviality is deliberately advanced for the sake of
such advantageous results; and this offers, further confirmation of the
substantial character that we have ascribed to the feelings of
companionship.</p>
<p>It also forms a transition to a second kind of pure conviviality:
from the sharing of experience to a participation in joint activities.
Such cooperation is usually incidental to a purpose jointly aimed at,
but it becomes purely convivial in the joint performance of a ritual. By
fully participating in a ritual, the members of a group affirm the
community of their existence, and at the same time identify the life of
their group with that of antecedent groups, from whom the ritual has
descended to them Every ritual act of a group is to this extent a
reconciliation within the group and a re-establishment of continuity
with its own history as a group. It affirms the convivial existence of
the group as transcending the individual, both in the present and
through times past. The occasions for these emotional reaffirmations are
anniversary dates or the recurrent changes by which the group undergoes
reconstitution. Its coherence is renewed ritually to the annual rhythm
of the seasons, or else when the occurrence of death, birth, marriage,
or other alterations of status, are solemnly consecrated in traditional
terms.13</p>
<p>Since rituals are a celebration of convivial existence they incur the
hostility of individualism, which denies value to group life as a form
of being, not accessible to the isolated individual. Ritual is
deprecated also both by the utilitarian on the grounds of serving no
tangible purpose, and by the romantic (the emotionalist brother of the
utilitarian) for suppressing people’s genuine spontaneous feelings, in
favour of the standardized public emotions which they are forced
insincerely to pretend to share. Traditionalism is even more
fundamentally discredited by reflecting on the fact that the solemnity
to which we surrender in performing a ritual is of man’s own making. We
seem both to generate it and submit to it as something external to us,
and in doing so we seem to dupe ourselves and deceive our fellows. We
see reappear here the internal insecurity of self-set standards, in the
fuller range of their social setting.</p>
