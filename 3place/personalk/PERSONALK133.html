<h4 id="the-logic-of-achievement">11. THE LOGIC OF ACHIEVEMENT</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In the case of pharmacology and other areas where science and
technology overlap (see Part Two, ch. 6, p. 179), the operational
principles in question overlap with the laws of nature which are the
conditions of their practicability. Even so, the action of an
operational principle can always be distinguished from a natural law by
its instrumental context. It is an action; which as such can succeed or
fail.</p></li>
<li><p>I have pointed out before (Part Two, ch. 6, p. 161) that the
rules of scientific procedure on which we rely, and the scientific
beliefs and valuations which we hold, are mutually determined, and also
(Part Two, ch. 6, p. 184) that mathematics can be equally affiliated to
natural science or technology. We have seen later that the truth of a
factual sentence is equivalent to the rightness of its assertion. But
these interrelations, which could be traced back to the structure of
perception and the exploratory activities of the lower animals, are
intrinsic to the process of acquiring knowledge. They represent the
universal interpenetration of sensing and groping (see Part One, ch. 4,
pp. 55–6), and not the duality of an operational principle contrasted
with the medium in which it is incorporated.</p></li>
<li><p>Logical machines were discussed earlier in Part Three, ch. 8,
p. 261.</p></li>
<li><p>Cf. e.g. Jean Piaget, Logic and Psychology, Manchester,
1953.</p></li>
<li><p>P. 74.</p></li>
<li><p>Pp. 316–17.</p></li>
<li><p>P. 62.</p></li>
<li><p>Pp. 96–7.</p></li>
<li><p>I have given ample evidence that such comprehensive questions are
decided by our vision of the general nature of things, and that the
guidance of such a vision is indispensable to science. (see p. 135). But
since the fiduciary character of such general conceptions is rarely
acknowledged, I shall quote here two statements by K. S. Lashley in
respect to my present subject matter. Speaking for the assembled members
of the Hixon Symposium of 1948 on cerebral mechanisms in behaviour,
Professor Lashley declared: (1) ‘Our common meeting ground is the faith
to which we all subscribe, I believe, that the phenomena of behavior and
of mind are ultimately describable in the concepts of the mathematical
and physical sciences’ (p. 112), and later, speaking only for himself:
(2) ‘I am coming more and more to the conviction that the rudiments of
every human behavioral mechanism will be found far down in the
evolutionary scale and also represented even in primitive activities of
the nervous, system. If there exist, in human cerebral action, processes
which seem fundamentally different or inexplicable in terms of our
present construct of the elementary physiology of integration, then it
is probable that that construct is incomplete or mistaken, even for the
levels of behavior to which it is applied’ (Cerebral Mechanisms in
Behavior: The Hixon Symposium, ed. L1. A. Jeffress, New York and London,
1951, p. 135). While I fully endorse the necessity of such fiduciary
statements and also accept the principle of continuity (2) as propounded
by K. S. Lashley, I do not share his belief (1) that mind can be
represented in terms of physics and chemistry. Not even a machine can be
thus represented.</p></li>
<li><p>See pp. 263–4 and 312.</p></li>
<li><p>See p. 124.</p></li>
<li><p>K. S. Lashley, Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence, Chicago, 1929,
pp. 136 ff. See also ibid., p. 99.</p></li>
<li><p>At this level equipotentiality is invariably a discovery of the
means to a predetermined end. Its generalization to intellectual
comprehension, and to the whole field of heuristics beyond that,
transcends this limitation on grounds of the continuity between groping
and sensing.</p></li>
<li><p>W. v. Buddenbrock, Biologisches Zentralblatt, 1921, 41,
41–8.</p></li>
<li><p>A. Bethe, Handbuch der normalen und pathologischen Physiologie,
1931, 15 (Zweite H.), 1175–1220.</p></li>
<li><p>K. S. Lashley, in the Hixon Symposium of 1951 (p. 124), concurs
in Bethe’s argument. Bethe’s work has been followed up extensively by E.
v. Holst (see particularly Die Naturwissenschaften, 37 (1950), 464–76)
in an attempt to lend greater precision to Bethe’s dynamic conception of
muscular co-ordination. Paul Weiss has proved the absence of
anatomically fixed co-ordinative paths in the central nervous system by
showing that the co-ordination of muscles remains unaffected when these
are attached to nerve fibres belonging to an arbitrary assortment of
neurons. For this fact and other supporting evidence see Analysis of
Development, ed. B. H. Willier, P. A. Weiss and V. Hamburger,
Philadelphia and London, 1955, ‘Neurogenesis’, by Paul Weiss,
p. 388.</p></li>
<li><p>Recent experiments carried out in the laboratory of Paul Weiss
(Proc. Nat. Acad. U.S.A., 42 (1956), 819) have strikingly expanded the
domain of equipotential reorganization. Embryonic skin-, cartilage- or
kidney-tissue was subjected to complete dissociation into separate
freely floating cells. It was found that cells from any one of these
tissues, thrown together at random, proliferated in cultures to form
higher stages of the tissue in question; thus producing respectively
feather germs, kidney tubules or a cartilage of a characteristic
type.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We may add also that the powers of morphogenetic integration have
long since been acknowledged by some investigators as essentially akin
to the powers of comprehension, to which Gestalt psychology has directed
our attention. The concluding paragraph of the Silliman Lectures
delivered in 1938 by the great master of experimental embryology, Hans
Spemann, expresses this eloquently. ‘There still remains an explanation
(he writes) which I believe I owe the reader. Again and again terms have
been used which point not to physical but to mental analogies. This was
meant to be more than a poetical metaphor. It was meant to express my
conviction that the suitable reaction of a germ fragment, endowed with
the most diverse potencies, in an embryonic “field”, its behavior in a
definite “situation”, is not a common chemical reaction, but that these
processes of development, like all vital processes, are comparable, in
the way they are connected, to nothing we know in such a degree as to
those vital processes of which we have the most intimate knowledge,
viz. the mental ones. It was to express my opinion that, even laying
aside all philosophical conclusions, merely for the interest of exact
research, we ought not to miss the chance given to us by our position
between the two worlds. Here and there this intuition is dawning at
present. On the way to the high new goal I hope to have made a few steps
with these experiments’ (Hans Spemann, Embryonic Development and
Induction, New Haven, 1933, p. 371. I have taken the liberty of
replacing in 11. 3 and 13 the word ‘psychical’ by ‘mental’, the
equivalent of the German ‘seelisch’ which, I believe, Spemann had in
mind).</p>

<li><p>Examples of such functional stability despite anatomical lesions
were given in the foregoing section. The discovery that even extensive
brain ablations produce little reduction in the intelligent performances
of animals is due to K. S. Lashley (Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence,
Chicago, 1929). Objections against the digital computer model were
raised at the Hixon Symposium (1951) on these and partly similar
grounds, by K. S. Lashley, Paul Weiss, Ralph Gerard and Lorente de Nó.
(But no one dissented from the fundamental belief, for which I quoted K.
S. Lashley above on p. 335, that thinking beings are automata.)</p></li>
