<h4 id="three-aspects-of-stability">9. THREE ASPECTS OF STABILITY</h4>
<p>The resistance of an idiom of belief against the impact of adverse
evidence may be regarded under three headings, each of which is
illustrated by the manner in which Azande retain their beliefs in the
face of situations which in our view should invalidate them. Analogous
cases can be adduced from other systems of beliefs.</p>
<p>The stability of Zande beliefs is due, in the first place, to the
fact that objections to them can be met one by one. This power of a
system of implicit beliefs to defeat valid objections one by one is due
to the circularity of such systems. By this I mean that the convincing
power possessed by the interpretation of any particular new topic in
terms of such a conceptual framework is based on past applications of
the same framework to a great number of other topics not now under
consideration, while if any of these other topics were questioned now,
their interpretation in its turn would similarly rely for support on the
interpretation of all the others. Evans-Pritchard observes this for
Zande beliefs in mystical notions. ’The contradiction between experience
and one mystical notion is explained by reference to other mystical
notions.’22</p>
<p>So long as each doubt is defeated in its turn, its effect is to
strengthen the fundamental convictions against which it was raised. ’Let
the reader consider (writes Evans-Pritchard) any argument that would
utterly demolish all Zande claims for the power of the oracle. If it
were translated into Zande modes of thought it would serve to support
their entire structure of belief.’23 Thus the circularity of a
conceptual system tends to reinforce itself by every contact with a
fresh topic.</p>
<p>The circularity of the theory of the universe embodied in any
particular language is manifested in an elementary fashion by the
existence of a dictionary of the language. If you doubt, for example,
that a particular English noun, verb, adjective or adverb has any
meaning in English, an English dictionary dispels this doubt by a
definition using other nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, the
meaningfulness of which is not doubted for the moment. Enquiries of this
kind will increasingly confirm us in the use of a language.</p>
<p>Remember also what we have found about the axiomatization of
mathematics; namely that it merely declares the beliefs implied in the
practice of mathematical reasoning. The axiomatized system is therefore
circular: our anterior acceptance of mathematics lends authority to its
axioms, from which we then deduce in turn all mathematical
demonstrations. The division of mathematical formulae, or of the
asserted sentences of any deductive system, into axioms and theorems is
indeed largely conventional, for we can usually replace some or all of
the axioms by theorems and derive from these the previous axioms as
theorems. Every assertion of a deductive system can be demonstrated by,
or else shown to be implied as axioms of, the others. Therefore, if we
doubt each assertion in its turn each is found confirmed by circularity,
and the refutation of each consecutive doubt results in strengthening
our belief in the system as a whole.</p>
<p>Circularity operates by divided roles when a number of persons
holding the same set of pre-suppositions mutually confirm each other’s
interpretation of experience. Take the following story of a South
African explorer, L. Magyar, collected by Lévy-Brühl who regards it as
typical.24 Two African natives, S. and K., went to the wood to gather
honey. S. found four big trees full of honey, whilst K. could find only
one. K. went home bewailing his ill luck, while S. had been so
fortunate. Meanwhile S., having returned to the wood to bring away the
honey, was attacked by a lion and torn to pieces.</p>
<p>The relatives of the lion’s victim at once went to the soothsayer to
discover who was responsible for his death. The soothsayer consults the
oracle several times and declares that K., jealous of S.’s rich harvest
of honey, assumed the form of a lion in order to avenge himself. The
accused denied his guilt strenuously and the chieftain ordered the
matter to be settled by the ordeal of poison. ‘Matters then followed
their usual course’—says the explorer’s account—’the ordeal was
unfavourable to the accused, he confessed and succumbed to torture. . .
. The accusation appears quite natural to the soothsayer who formulates
it, the prince who orders the trial by ordeal, the crowd of bystanders
and to K. himself who had been transformed into a lion, in fact to
everybody except the European who happens to be present.’25</p>
<p>It is clear to us that K. had not actually experienced turning into a
lion and tearing S. to pieces, and so at first he denied having done so.
But he is confronted with an overwhelming case against himself. The
interpretative framework which he shares with his accusers does not
include the conception of accidental death; if a man is devoured by a
lion there must be some effective reason behind it, such as the envy of
a rival. This makes him an obvious suspect and when the oracle, which he
has always trusted, confirms the suspicion, he can no longer resist the
evidence of his guilt and he confesses having turned into a lion and
having devoured S. This closes the circle of the argument and confirms
the magical framework in which it was conducted, and it thus enhances
the powers of this framework for assimilating the next case which will
come under its purview.</p>
<p>Communists who have experienced the procedure which leads to
confessions in Russian sabotage trials have described a similar
circularity. The prisoner will usually resist the accusation to start
with, but when it is persistently borne in upon him from all sides by
the examining magistrate and by the evidence extorted from his former
associates, he begins to give way to the convincing power of the case
against himself.26 On the grounds on which he had habitually condemned
others he tends now to condemn himself—and thus close the circle which
once more confirms these grounds and makes them stronger than ever for
the next occasion.</p>
<p>A second aspect of stability arises from an automatic expansion of
the circle in which an interpretative system operates. It readily
supplies elaborations of the system which will cover almost any
conceivable eventuality, however embarrassing this may appear at first
sight. Scientific theories which possess this self-expanding capacity
are sometimes described as epicyclical, in allusion to the epicycles
that were used in the Ptolemaic and Copernican theory to represent
planetary motions in terms of uniform circular motions. All major
interpretative frameworks have an epicyclical structure which supplies a
reserve of subsidiary explanations for difficult situations. The
epicyclical character of Zande beliefs was shown above by the ready
availability of eight different subsidiary assumptions for explaining a
point-blank self-contradiction in two consecutive answers of an
oracle.</p>
<p>The stability of Zande beliefs is manifested, thirdly, in the way it
denies to any rival conception the ground in which it might take root.
Experiences which support it could be adduced only one by one. But a new
conception, e.g. that of natural causation, which would take the place
of Zande superstitution, could be established only by a whole series of
relevant instances, and such evidence cannot accumulate in the minds of
people if each of them is disregarded in its turn for lack of the
concept which would lend significance to it. The behaviour of Azande
whom Evans-Pritchard tried to convince that benge was a natural poison
which owed none of its effectiveness to the incantations customarily
accompanying its administration, illustrates the kind of contemptuous
indifference with which we normally regard things of which we have no
conception. ‘We feel neither curiosity nor wonder’, writes William
James, ‘concerning things so far beyond us that we have no concepts to
refer them to or standards by which to measure them.’ The Feugians in
Darwin’s voyage, he recalls, wondered at the small boats, but paid no
attention to the big ship lying at anchor in front of them.27 A more
recent instance of this occurred when Igor Gouzenko, cypher clerk of the
Soviet Embassy in Canada, tried in vain for two days in succession
(September 5th and 6th, 1945) to attract attention to the documents
concerning Soviet atomic espionage which he was showing round in Ottawa
at the risk of his life.</p>
<p>This third defence mechanism of implicit beliefs may be called the
principle of suppressed nucleation. It is complementary to the
operations of circularity and self-expansion. While these protect an
existing system of beliefs against doubts arising from any adverse piece
of evidence, suppressed nucleation prevents the germination of any
alternative concepts on the basis of any such evidence.</p>
<p>Circularity, combined with a readily available reserve of epicyclical
elaborations and the consequent suppression in the germ of any rival
conceptual development, lends a degree of stability to a conceptual
framework which we may describe as the measure of its completeness. We
may acknowledge the completeness or comprehensiveness of a language and
the system of conceptions conveyed by it—as we do in respect to Azande
beliefs in witchcraft—without in any way implying that the system is
correct.</p>
