<h4 id="randomness-an-example-of-emergence">3. RANDOMNESS, AN EXAMPLE OF
EMERGENCE</h4>
<p>But emergence begins already in the inanimate domain, as can be seen
from the relation of randomness to the particulars of the random system.
Many years of fruitless endeavour have proved that it is impossible to
define the probabilities derived from the random character of a system
by the microscopic details of the system. This should encourage us to
align randomness with other comprehensive features which are
unspecifiable in terms of their particulars; and the analogy between
these various cases will strengthen the concept of emergence as being
that which they have in common.9</p>
<p>The shuffling of a pack of cards is a process of emergence. Card
players think they know how to produce a well shuffled pack of cards,
and writers on probability tend to agree that we may talk of such a pack
of cards.10 But we can produce a well shuffled pack only if we do not
know how we do it. For if we knew the details of the process of
shuffling, we would know the final arrangement of the cards, so that the
pack would no longer be in a random state and no statistical statements
could be made about the chances of pulling out a particular card from
it. This holds generally. If I knew exactly the conditions of a throw of
dice I could predict the result, but could no longer guess it. I could
say nothing about the statistical properties of dice from a description
which would tell me the result of future throws made by a machine.</p>
<p>I call this a case of emergence, for we can know the randomness of a
system, yet cannot know it in terms of a more detailed knowledge of the
system. Our knowledge of this emergent quality, randomness, is in fact
destroyed by observing the particulars which determine the system below
the emergent level. Moreover, randomness, as an emergent quality, offers
a possibility for a new system of manipulations. In the case of a
wellshuffled pack of cards or an unbiassed dice, these consist in
estimating the chances of alternative events and betting accordingly on
their outcome.</p>
<p>In science the most important random system is the molecular motion
in a gas. For the better part of the past hundred years mathematical
physicists have tried to specify the randomness of a gaseous molecular
aggregate in terms of its mechanical particulars. But this is logically
impossible. If we knew exactly the position and velocity of each
molecule (within the limits of wave mechanics) we could only predict the
behaviour of the molecules, but not the comprehensive features defined
by randomness. Two comprehensive features of a gas which determine its
condition are its temperature and pressure. The gas can be said to have
a definite temperature and a definite pressure only if we assume that
its molecules are in random motion; an assumption which is incompatible
with our knowing the configuration of molecular motions in the
gas.11</p>
<p>It could be objected that from the detailed knowledge of all the
molecules in a gas we could calculate what a thermometer, or a gauge,
would show at different places in the gas. We may be able to predict
such readings. But the results would mean nothing unless they could be
assumed to originate from a random condition of the gas.</p>
<p>For this we would have to fall back on a manner of stirring—like the
shuffling by which cards are randomized. And if we trusted ourselves
with the capacity of randomizing also several separate parts of a gas,
we could also establish differences in temperature and pressure between
them and predict that these differences would be equalized by a process
of self randomization inherent in a system of particles in random
motion. These processes would be irreversible, since it would be
contrary to our assumption of randomness that a random aggregate should
sort itself out—except by occasional fluctuations—into a less random
state, unless compelled by inner forces or external intervention.</p>
<p>Randomization may be unsuccessful; a trace of order may always remain
undestroyed.12 In this sense randomness may be regarded as an
achievement. In any case, as a comprehensive feature, randomness is
subject to the logic of achievement. We can identify this logic here
with the logic of emergence. The emergent form of existence is
identified by our comprehensive judgment of it, which judgment accredits
thereby, indirectly, a correlated context of properties, and of problems
and manipulations, all of which presuppose the emergent form of
existence and serve to elaborate its reality. This entire emergent
system (consisting in the present case of randomness and probabilities,
of averages, temperatures and pressures, of irreversible processes and
thermal fluctuations, etc.) is unspecifiable in terms of its detailed
particulars. But the particulars have a bearing on higher-level
features. If the molecular motion in a gas is known to be random, we can
evaluate from its particulars the temperature, pressure, entropy, etc.
of the gas.</p>
<p>It is clear in this case also that unspecifiability is not simply
ignorance. It has been frequently pointed out that you cannot identify a
random system if you know nothing about it; I obviously cannot say that
a sequence of numbers is random, if I do not know it to be random. But
this holds even conversely. I can tell (from the nature of irrational
numbers) that the sequence of digits in is not random, though I may not
know anything else about it; while on the other hand I may be familiar
with the derivation of the number π and yet affirm that the sequence of
its digits is random. For statistical tests have shown that the first
2000 digits of π follow no recognizable pattern,13 except of course that
of being derived by a computation of π, which is too cumbersome to be
carried out mentally. In the case of π we can also tell for once fairly
well what it is that we must know and what we must not know in order to
identify randomness. The principle by which π is computed identifies the
random number π, but any actual computation of π would destroy the
randomness.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics does not affect the argument either in respect of a
well shuffled pack of cards, or of the throws of dice, or of a gas
conceived as an aggregate of molecules chasing around at random. Its
wording would merely have to be changed by replacing the ‘laws of
mechanics’ everywhere by the ‘laws of quantum mechanics’. This will make
no difference for packs of cards or for dice and little difference for
gases other than hydrogen, for the laws of quantum mechanics coincide
with those of mechanics for reasonably heavy particles. However, to be
precise, the classical predictions of positions and velocities would
have to be replaced by predictions of the probability distribution of
positions and velocities.14</p>
