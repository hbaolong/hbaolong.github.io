<h4 id="religious-doubt">7. RELIGIOUS DOUBT</h4>
<p>The belief in the efficacy of doubt as a solvent of error was
sustained primarily—from Hume to Russell—by scepticism about religious
dogma and the dislike of religious bigotry. This has been the dominant
passion of critical thought for centuries, in the course of which it has
completely transformed man’s outlook on the universe. It must,
accordingly, form the main subject of my critique of doubt. I shall
limit the argument to religious doubts in respect of the Christian
faith, picking up the thread from the point reached in my chapter on
Intellectual Passions.</p>
<p>Religion, considered as an act of worship, is an indwelling rather
than an affirmation. God cannot be observed, any more than truth or
beauty can be observed. He exists in the sense that He is to be
worshipped and obeyed, but not otherwise; not as a fact—any more than
truth, beauty or justice exist as facts. All these, like God, are things
which can be apprehended only in serving them. The words ‘God exists’
are not, therefore, a statement of fact, such as ‘snow is white’, but an
accreditive statement, such as ‘“snow is white” is true’, and this
determines the kind of doubt to which the statement ‘God exists’ can be
subjected.14 For since ‘“snow is white” is true’ stands for an
a-critical act of assertion made by the speaker, it is not a descriptive
sentence and cannot be the subject of explicit doubt. It can merely be
uttered with varying degrees of confidence, and what its assertion may
lack in perfect assurance might then be regarded as the doubt attached
by the speaker to his own assertion. This would be a tacit doubt, an
inarticulate hesitancy, like that of a marksman dubiously pulling the
trigger, and the words ‘God exists’ can also be doubted only in the
sense of a tacit hesitancy.</p>
<p>But this formulation somewhat exaggerates the sharpness of the
distinction between acts of faith which imply (in a sense yet to be
explored) the existence of God, and the meaning of the words ‘God
exists’. It is true that these words form no part of worship and can
mean nothing beyond the endorsement of an act of faith by which the
speaker has surrendered to God, yet it is not possible to separate this
act of acceptance as sharply from that which it accepts, as we can the
acceptance of factual statements from the accepted statements.</p>
<p>We shall turn for guidance instead, therefore, to the more general
relationship which obtains between our tacit powers of comprehension and
the spoken words and empirical particulars controlled by our
comprehension. (See Part Two, ch. 5, p. 92.) This will lead us back to
the conception of religious worship as a heuristic vision and align
religion in turn also with the great intellectual systems, such as
mathematics, fiction and the fine arts, which are validated by becoming
happy dwelling places of the human mind. We shall see then that in spite
of its a-critical character, the force of religious conviction does
depend on factual evidence and can be affected by doubt concerning
certain facts. Let me develop this programme.</p>
<p>In the chapter on Intellectual Passions I have described the
Christian faith as a passionate heuristic impulse which has no prospect
of consummation. A heuristic impulse is never without a sense of its
possible inadequacy, and what it lacks in absolute assurance may be
described as its inherent doubt. But the sense of inadequacy inherent in
the Christian faith goes beyond this, for it is part of the Christian
faith that its striving can never reach an endpoint at which, having
gained its desired result, its continuation would become unnecessary. A
Christian who reached his spiritual endpoint in this life would have
ceased to be a Christian. A sense of its own imperfection is essential
to his faith. ‘Faith embraces itself and the doubt about itself,’ writes
Tillich.15</p>
<p>Yet according to the Christian faith this inherent dubiety of the
true faith is sinful and this sin is an ineradicable source of anguish.
Take away doubt, sin and anguish, and Christian faith turns into a
caricature of itself. It becomes a set of inaccurate, often false and
largely meaningless statements, accompanied by conventional gestures and
complacent moralizing. This is the forbidden endpoint of all Christian
endeavour: its relapse into emptiness.</p>
<p>A heuristic impulse can live only in the pursuit of its proper
enquiry. The Christian enquiry is worship. The words of prayer and
confession, the actions of the ritual, the lesson, the sermon, the
church itself, are the clues of the worshipper’s striving towards God.
They guide his feelings of contrition and gratitude and his craving for
the divine presence, while keeping him safe from distracting
thoughts.</p>
<p>As a framework expressing its acceptance of itself as a dwelling
place of the passionate search for God, religious worship can say
nothing that is true or false. Words of prayer are addressed to God, and
while other parts of the service speak of God, they are mostly
declarations of interpersonal relations—such as the praise of God. Some
parts of worship, like the credo, admittedly make theological
assertions, and the lessons from the Bible are couched in plainly
narrative language. But the accent of the credo lies on the words: ‘I
believe’ which emotionally endorse worship, while the extracts from the
Bible are not quoted in the course of a Christian religious service in
order to convey information, but as starting points for teachings that
sustain the faith. All such statements function as subsidiaries to
worship.</p>
<p>But the doctrines of theology and the records of the Bible are also
taught in themselves. Can their statements then be said to be true or
false and be subjected to explicit doubt? The answer is neither yes nor
no, and it can be given here only in outline.</p>
<p>Only a Christian who stands in the service of his faith can
understand Christian theology and only he can enter into the religious
meaning of the Bible. Theology and the Bible together form the context
of worship and must be understood in their bearing on it; but we shall
see that this bearing is different in the two cases.</p>
<p>A theological statement, like ‘God exists’, may be little more than
the endorsement of an act of worship in descriptive terms; something
like saying ‘“Snow is white” is true’ after having confidently said
‘Snow is white’. To this extent the expression ‘God exists’ is
a-critical and not explicitly dubitable. But theology as a whole is an
intricate study of momentous problems. It is a theory of religious
knowledge and a corresponding ontology of the things thus known. As
such, theology reveals, or tries to reveal, the implications of
religious worship, and it can be said to be true or false, but only as
regards its adequacy in formulating and purifying a pre-existing
religious faith. While theological attempts to prove the existence of
God are as absurd as philosophical attempts to prove the premisses of
mathematics or the principles of empirical inference, theology pursued
as an axiomatization of the Christian faith has an important analytic
task. Though its results can be understood only by practising
Christians, it can greatly help them to understand what they are
practising.</p>
<p>Theological accounts of God must, of course, appear meaningless and
often blatantly self-contradictory if taken to claim validity within the
universe of observable experience. Such a result is inevitable, whenever
a language that is apposite to one subject matter is used with reference
to another altogether different matter. The comparatively modest attempt
to describe atomic processes in terms of classical electro-magnetics and
mechanics has led to self-contradictions which appeared no less
intolerable until we eventually got accustomed to them. Today physicists
enjoy these apparent absurdities which they alone can comprehend, even
as Tertullian seems to have enjoyed the startling paradoxes of his
faith. Far from raising doubts in my mind concerning the rationality of
Christian beliefs, the paradoxes of Christianity will serve me as
examples for an analogous framing and stabilizing of other beliefs by
which man strives to satisfy his own self-set standards.</p>
<p>Theology comprises biblical exegesis and the principles of biblical
exegesis, and in this context it deals also with the question which I
have set myself here, namely how religious faith depends on observable
facts, or—more precisely—on the truth or falsity of statements
concerning observable facts. I shall therefore have to trespass now for
a short stretch on the domain of theology.</p>
<p>I have described Christian religious service as a framework of clues
which are apt to induce a passionate search for God. I have spoken of
the tacit act of comprehension which originates faith from such clues.
The capacity for such skilful religious knowing seems universal, at
least in children. Once acquired, the skill is hardly ever lost, but it
is rarely mastered at an advanced age without some previous training in
childhood. Divine service can mean nothing to a person completely
lacking the skill of religious knowing.</p>
<p>The power of a framework composed of words and gestures to elicit its
own religious comprehension in a receptive person will depend partly on
the non-religious significance of its elements. The framework must
impress a child or an unbeliever in the first place by the appeal made
by its dogma, its narratives, its morality and its ritual exercise,
before these have been religiously comprehended by him. Historical
evidence confirming some decisive event recorded by the Gospels will,
therefore, augment the strength of Christian teaching. And conversely,
Biblical criticism and the progress of science which weakened or
destroyed the extra-religious plausibility of many Biblical narratives
and discredited the supposed magical powers of some Christian ritual,
were bound to shake a faith implemented by the assertion of such
teachings and the performance of such rituals. Modern theology has
accepted these attacks as its guide for re-interpreting and
consolidating the Christian faith in a truer form. In the following I
shall try to state this result in my own terms.16</p>
<p>Let us take in for this purpose the whole of experience,
including—but extending of course far beyond—the reading of the Bible,
and let us observe its religious effects on a person’s mind in the
process of his conversion. All this experience, which so far is still
non-religious, may supply the mind with clues to the Christian faith,
even as all kinds of knowledge, whether culled from scientific books or
obtained by direct observation, may serve as clues for a scientific
outlook. Both kinds of comprehension establish their own heuristic
vision which asserts no specific fact. They are forms of highly personal
knowledge which subsidiarily comprise a set of relatively impersonal
experiences. This relation of factual clues to a heuristic vision is
similar to the relation of factual experience to mathematics and to
works of art. The analogy brings religious faith into line with these
great articulate systems which are also based on experience, but which
the mind can yet inhabit without asserting any definite empirical facts.
External experience is indispensable both to mathematics and art, as
their theme, but to a person prepared to inhabit their framework,
mathematics or art convey their own internal thought, and it is for the
sake of this internal experience that his mind accepts their framework
as its dwelling place.</p>
<p>Religion stands in a similar relation to non-religious experience.
Secular experiences are its raw material: religion uses such experience
as its theme for building up its own universe. The universe of every
great articulate system is constructed by elaborating and transmuting
one particular aspect of anterior experience: the Christian faith
elaborates and renders effective the supernatural aspect of anterior
experience in terms of its own internal experience. The convert enters
into the articulate framework of worship and doctrine by surrendering to
the religious ecstasy which their system evokes and accredits thereby
its validity. This is again analogous to the process of validation by
which men learn to enjoy and pursue mathematics or to contemplate with
pleasure—and sometimes even produce—works of art.17</p>
<p>I have shown how natural science, mathematics and technology mutually
interpenetrate each other. All the arts are similarly interwoven; while
the arts and the methods of science penetrate each other in the domain
of the humanities. Religion has even more comprehensive affinities: it
can transpose all intellectual experiences into its own universe, and
has also served, in reverse, most other intellectual systems as their
theme. The relation of Christianity to natural experience, in which we
are interested here, is but one thread in this network of mutual
penetrations.</p>
<p>The two kinds of findings, the religious and the natural, by-pass
each other in the same way as the findings of law courts by-pass
ordinary experience. The acceptance of the Christian faith does not
express the assertion of observable facts and consequently you cannot
prove or disprove Christianity by experiments or factual records. Let me
apply this to the belief in miracles. Ever since the attacks of
philosophers like Bayle and Hume on the credibility of miracles,
rationalists have urged that the acknowledgment of miracles must rest on
the strength of factual evidence. But actually, the contrary is true: if
the conversion of water into wine or the resuscitation of the dead could
be experimentally verified, this would strictly disprove their
miraculous nature. Indeed, to the extent to which any event can be
established in the terms of natural science, it belongs to the natural
order of things. However monstrous and surprising it may be, once it has
been fully established as an observable fact, the event ceases to be
regarded as supernatural. Recent biological suggestions, for example,
that virgin birth might take place in exceptional circumstances would,
if accepted as the explanation of the birth of Christ, not confirm, but
totally destroy the doctrine of the Virgin Birth. It is illogical to
attempt the proof of the supernatural by natural tests, for these can
only establish the natural aspects of an event and can never represent
it as supernatural. Observation may supply us with rich clues for our
belief in God; but any scientifically convincing observation of God
would turn religious worship into an idolatrous adoration of a mere
object, or natural person.</p>
<p>Of course, an event which has in fact never taken place can have no
supernatural significance; and whether it has taken place or not must be
established by factual evidence. Hence the religious force of biblical
criticism, shaking or, alternatively, corroborating certain facts which
form the main themes of Christianity. But evidence that a fact has not
occurred may sometimes leave largely unimpaired the religious truth
conveyed by a narrative describing its occurrence. The book of Genesis
and its great pictorial illustrations, like the frescoes of
Michelangelo, remain a far more intelligent account of the nature and
origin of the universe than the representation of the world as a chance
collocation of atoms. For the biblical cosmology continues to
express—however inadequately—the significance of the fact that the world
exists and that man has emerged from it, while the scientific picture
denies any meaning to the world, and indeed ignores all our most vital
experience of this world. The assumption that the world has some meaning
which is linked to our own calling as the only morally responsible
beings in the world, is an important example of the supernatural aspect
of experience which Christian interpretations of the universe explore
and develop. In Chapter 13, I shall show how we can arrive by continuous
stages from the scientific study of evolution to its interpretation as a
clue to God.</p>
<p>Christianity is a progressive enterprise. Our vastly enlarged
perspectives of knowledge should open up fresh vistas of religious
faith. The Bible, and the Pauline doctrine in particular, may be still
pregnant with unsuspected lessons; and the greater precision and more
conscious flexibility of modern thought, shown by the new physics and
the logico-philosophic movements of our age, may presently engender
conceptual reforms which will renew and clarify, on the grounds of
modern extra-religious experience, man’s relation to God. An era of
great religious discoveries may lie before us.</p>
<p>Let me sum up my conclusions about religious doubt before going
further. The Christian faith can be attacked by doubt in two ways. Its
internal evidence can be doubted in the sense in which conceptual
innovations in mathematics or novel works of art can be held to be
unsound. We may refuse, or at least hesitate, to enter on the mental
life which they offer, either for want of appreciation for it or—more
forcibly—for fear of losing our hold on reality. A similar kind of doubt
applies to every heuristic vision: we are always conscious of some
hazard attached to it. This kind of doubt is the hesitancy of an
acceptance. Our reluctance to accept the habitation offered to our minds
may be craven or wise, and so we may prove eventually to have been dull
or rash. Yet we can apply to our action no test of the kind to which we
can appeal for proving or disproving an explicit declaratory statement.
There is therefore no possibility either for doubting what we do (or
declare we do) in the sense in which an explicit statement can be
doubted. Our doubt must remain intrinsic to a mental act of our own.</p>
<p>It is also part of the Christian faith that its striving is
unfulfillable. It must always remain painfully conscious of its inherent
dubiety. But since this is part of the faith, it does not derogate from
it. Yet this indispensable internal dubiety of the Christian faith can
be increased, even to the point of destroying our faith altogether, by
explicit critical tests of the articulate framework on which we rely for
deploying our faith. For the power of this framework to induce its own
comprehension in terms of a surrender to God depends to an important
extent on the convincing power of the statements which are its elements,
in the same way as the power of a set of clues for inducing a heuristic
vision based on these clues will depend on the reliability of the facts
used as clues. Doubts directed against the clues as facts may thus shake
the internal evidence of the system relying on them. Explicit doubts may
intensify the intrinsic doubts of our acceptance to the point of
converting it into a complete rejection.</p>
<p>The weakening of religious beliefs under the impact of advancing
historical and scientific knowledge during the past 300 years
represents, therefore, a case in which the effect of doubt was
substantial. It destroyed the religious meaning of things without fully
compensating for this loss by a different meaning, and the total volume
of belief, from which all meaning flows, was effectively reduced. If the
universe were in fact meaningless, the destruction of religious beliefs
would have been fully justified. Since I do not believe that the
universe is meaningless, I can admit only that the rejection of religion
was reasonable in view of the grounds on which religious doctrines were
asserted at the time. Today we should be grateful for the prolonged
attacks made by rationalists on religion for forcing us to renew the
grounds of the Christian faith. But this does not remotely justify the
acknowledgment of doubt as the universal solvent of error which will
leave truth untouched behind. For all truth is but the external pole of
belief, and to destroy all belief would be to deny all truth. Though
religious beliefs are often formulated more dogmatically than other
beliefs, this is not essential. The extensive dogmatic framework of
Christianity arose from ingenious efforts, sustained through many
centuries, to axiomatize the faith already practised by Christians. In
view of the high imaginative and emotional powers by which Christian
beliefs control the whole person and relate him to the universe, the
specification of these beliefs is much more colourful than are the
axioms of arithmetic or the premisses of natural science. But they
belong to the same class of statements, performing kindred fiduciary
functions.</p>
<p>We owe our mental existence predominantly to works of art, morality,
religious worship, scientific theory and other articulate systems which
we accept as our dwelling place and as the soil of our mental
development. Objectivism has totally falsified our conception of truth,
by exalting what we can know and prove, while covering up with ambiguous
utterances all that we know and cannot prove, even though the latter
knowledge underlies, and must ultimately set its seal to, all that we
can prove. In trying to restrict our minds to the few things that are
demonstrable, and therefore explicitly dubitable, it has overlooked the
a-critical choices which determine the whole being of our minds and has
rendered us incapable of acknowledging these vital choices.</p>
