<h4 id="matters-of-fact">15. MATTERS OF FACT</h4>
<p>We see now that throughout my previous text, in which I spoke
confidently of such things as science and art as forming part of our
culture, and of law and morality preserving justice and decency, I have
been begging some decisive questions. I was referring to ‘bourgeois’
science, ‘bourgeois’ art, and generally ‘bourgeois’ culture, law,
morality, justice, etc., which are not acknowledged as genuine science,
art, culture, law, morality, justice, etc. by their Marxist-Stalinist
critics, but are condemned by them as corrupt, objectivist, idealist,
cosmopolitan, formalist or undemocratic. They deny the whole set of
standards which I took for granted when speaking of science, art,
culture, law and morality, and reduce the intellectual and moral
passions upholding these standards, which I have agreed to share, to the
status of an illusory subjectivity. The instability of these standards
in the light of critical reflection is to them no source of anxiety but
of triumphant satisfaction. The consummation of this instability, which
looms to me as the final self-destruction of the human mind, would be to
them but the final unmasking of my idealistic deceptions. Within a
society based on Dialectical Materialism, the forces of coercion,
anchored to the centre of a supreme power, become in fact the agents of
valid appreciation. If, then, standards are seen to be upheld by force,
this no longer makes them appear questionable but marks them instead
with the stamp of authenticity.</p>
<p>Nor does this process of mental inversion stop here altogether. It
inevitably undermines the very conception of facts—of ordinary matters
of fact. Remember that the overwhelming part of our factual beliefs are
held at second hand through trusting others; and that in the great
majority of cases our trust is placed in the authority of certain
persons, either by virtue of their public office or as our chosen
intellectual leaders. The establishment of public facts outside science
is entrusted, in free societies, to newspapers, parliaments, and law
courts. Their fact-finding is continuous with that of sociologists,
historians, and scientists, and is granted strong presumptive credit
also by the whole of society, even though there are always dubious cases
in which rival affirmation will compete for public acceptance. As in
science, this system of shared beliefs relies on a chain of overlapping
areas, within each of which a few authoritative persons can keep watch
over each other’s integrity and their sense of what is important. A
society affiliated to such a network of mutual confidence may be said to
maintain a certain standard of ‘factuality’—provided that one accepts
its methods of fact-finding.40</p>
<p>We know, of course, that even people whose conceptions of the nature
of things otherwise coincide, may be fundamentally divided in respect to
the reality of certain facts. Antagonists on either side of a great
scientific controversy do not accept the same facts as real and
significant. A society believing in magic, witchcraft and oracles, will
agree on a whole system of facts which modern men regard as fictitious.
Similar logical gaps could be found between standards of factuality
prevailing in different periods of European history. But I will keep
here to the effects of contemporary political dynamics on the
accrediting of matters of fact.</p>
<p>The widely extended network of mutual trust, on which the factual
consensus of a free society depends, is fragile. Any conflict which
sharply divides people will tend to destroy their mutual trust and make
universal agreement on facts bearing on the conflict difficult to
achieve. In France the Third Republic was shaken to its foundations by a
question of fact: the question whether Captain Dreyfus had written the
‘bordereau’. In Britain the dispute over the genuineness of the
‘Zinoviev Letter’, as in the U.S. the trial of Alger Hiss, aroused
popular conflicts which made it impossible to agree universally on the
facts of these matters.</p>
<p>Such temporary and partial failures of factuality may of course be
excused as passing excesses of political passion. But under
totalitarianism we can see factuality reduced to the extent of allowing
the State to fashion public facts almost at will, as it suits its own
interests. These powers to spread falsehoods are due to some extent
simply to the government’s monopoly of public utterances, backed by
terror; but such coercive powers do not account for the currency gained
by these falsehoods abroad. Any willing acceptance of these facts is
evidence of a persuasiveness of their own, which must be assumed to be
effective also in gaining currency for them within the territories under
coercion. This indicates a corruption of the very principles of factual
evidence, involving a wholesale shift of the usual presumptions which
underlie the process of fact-finding. It is only when our sense of
reality has already been gravely impaired by such a shift, that we
become receptive to downright clumsy falsifications.</p>
<p>A modern revolutionary government aiming at the total renewal of
society inevitably sets off this change by severing all ties with its
opponents. Whoever is not its unconditional supporter is held to be its
mortal enemy. The dictatorship thus creates a situation in which any
dissenter must in fact become its mortal enemy, and this justifies
unlimited suspicion. When all open dissent is eliminated, disaffection
can manifest itself only in trifles, and hence the secret police must be
allowed to construe trifles as potential conspiratorial acts. The
presuppositions of such investigations become analogous to those
governing the Freudian analysis of a neurotic. On the assumption of an
Oedipus complex, the patient’s every word and action, whether uttered or
unspoken, done or undone (and even events in which he became involved by
accident), can be interpreted as expressing his hidden hostility to his
father. Similarly, once you assume that any trifles may be interpreted
as a sign of disaffection which, in its turn, may be construed into an
act of high treason, the methods of fact-finding practised in Stalin’s
prisons will appear to have been altogether appropriate to the purpose.
Even the exercise of physical pressure bordering on torture will become
inevitable—for the same reasons which made torture indispensable to the
Inquisition. Accusations concerning a man’s hidden intentions cannot be
regarded as firmly established unless the accused eventually admits
them, and for this he must be morally, intellectually and physically
broken. The extorted confessions of others confront those still
resisting pressure with an increased persuasive force and thus extend
further the fictitious universe established by violence or
sophistry.</p>
<p>This process of fashioning public facts in the interests of the state
will naturally receive support from a scholarship conceived as a
political weapon. Historians will supplement accusations of recent
subversive activities by suitably re-interpreting the part played by the
accused at earlier times of history. Stories which otherwise might seem
fantastic will be rendered plausible in view of the ruling party’s
conspiratorial experience. There is nothing absurd in accusing a veteran
communist of having always been in the pay of the police, since a
Malinovsky, for many years Lenin’s most trusted fellow conspirator and
leader of the Bolshevik fraction in the Duma, could turn out later to
have been a police spy during all that time.41</p>
<p>In every modern country, national prejudice tends to obfuscate the
establishment of public facts of political interest. In a free society
this tendency is counteracted by the rivalry of opinions, which will
maintain a universe of true facts so long as people can mutually trust
each other to observe a proper level of factuality in drawing their
conclusions from contradictory arguments. The élite of a modern
revolutionary party is trained, on the contrary, to exercise its
political bias to the utmost. ‘Its members’ whole education’ (writes
Hannah Arendt) ’is aimed at abolishing their capacity for distinguishing
between truth and fiction. Their superiority consists in the ability
immediately to dissolve every statement of fact into a declaration of
purpose.’42 Such dynamism, backed up by terror, would suffice by itself
to loosen the roots in reality of all officially alleged facts, and to
separate revolutionary opinion by a logical gap from that of their
opponents. Yet this propaganda would remain comparatively ineffectual,
but for the parallel effects of terror and secrecy in creating
situations which lend colour to every conceivable suspicion. At this
point facts relevant to politics cease altogether to exist, in the sense
that one can only choose between either accepting no facts, or accepting
some at one’s pleasure on manifestly insufficient evidence.</p>
<p>My own insistence on the reality of facts in public life implies
therefore that I am speaking from inside a free society to which I give
my allegiance,43 just as my insistence on the independent status of
science, art and morality implies such participation and allegiance.</p>
