<h4 id="the-powers-of-articulate-thought">4. THE POWERS OF ARTICULATE
THOUGHT</h4>
<p>The following examples should illustrate the immense range of mental
powers generated by the simple machinery of denoting, reorganizing and
reading, and should show at the same time that though our powers of
thought be ever so much enhanced by the use of symbols, they still
operate ultimately within the same medium of unformalized intelligence
which we share with the animals.</p>
<p>The use of a geographical map for finding one’s way offers, for this
exceptionally simple case, a rough numerical estimate of the inferential
powers derived from a suitably arranged representation of experience. A
rough map of England can be drawn by marking by dots on a sheet of paper
the geographical positions of the 200 largest English towns, the
Cartesian co-ordinates of each dot being chosen in a constant proportion
to the longitude and latitude of one town, and each dot having the name
of the corresponding town printed below it. From such a map we can read
off at a glance the itineraries by which we can get about from any town
to any other, so that our original input of 400 positional data (200
longitudes and 200 latitudes) thus yields itineraries. Actually, the
information derived from mapping will be much ampler even than this.
Each itinerary will comprise on the average some fifty places, amounting
to about a million items, that is 2500 times the input.</p>
<p>The original catalogue of 200 towns, listing their longitudes and
latitudes, would be comparatively useless, for it does not represent
their mutual position in a way which the eye can readily take in. We may
regard the transposition of the catalogue into the shape of a map as a
formal operation carried out on its data, to be followed by the informal
operation of reading off a variety of itineraries from the map.
Similarly, the reports coming in during the air battles over England
(1940) were continuously pictured at Air Force Command on a large table,
offering thereby to the Supreme Commander a representation of the
changing situation which he could grasp far better than the reports
themselves. We know how the mere plotting of a series of numerical data
on paper in the form of a graph, may reveal functional relationships
quite unsuspected from our knowledge of the original figures. An example
of this is the graphic representation of time-tables used for the
direction of railroad traffic, which shows immediately the places and
times at which trains overtake or meet each other, a piece of
information which is not easily deduced from ordinary time-tables.</p>
<p>In all these instances of the enhancement of our intellectual powers
by suitable symbolization, it is clear that the mere manipulation of
symbols does not in itself supply any new information, but is effective
only because it assists the inarticulate mental powers exercised by
reading off their result. This may not be so obvious for the process of
deriving new information by means of mathematical computations; but it
is true all the same here too. Supposing we know that Paul is one year
less than twice the age of Peter, while the difference between their
ages is four, and we want to find the ages of each. We have first to set
out the situation symbolically; age of Paul x, age of Peter y, and x =
2y—1; x—y = 4. Then we operate on the symbols and obtain x = 9, y = 5;
which is finally read out as: Paul is aged 9 and Peter is aged 5.
However crudely mechanical this procedure may be, its performance does
require a measure of controlling intelligence. The original situation of
Peter and Paul must be understood and the problem involved in it clearly
recognized; then its symbolic representation, including the subsequent
operations, has to be correctly performed and the result correctly
interpreted. All of this requires intelligence, and it is in the course
of these tacit feats of intelligence that the formal operations utilized
in the process are accredited and their result accepted by the person
carrying them out.</p>
<p>The operations of the few simple principles illustrated here can in
fact account (in terms of the first approximation defined on page 70)
for the expansion of human intelligence from the basic types of
inarticulate learning observed in animals to the articulate domains of
engineering, of the natural sciences and of pure mathematics.</p>
<p>Take first the natural sciences, both of the exact and the
descriptive kind. The numerical denotation of experience, followed by
computations yielding new information, can be expanded into the logical
machinery of the exact sciences by including in our computation the use
of a formula representing a law of nature. I have already dealt at some
length with the exact empirical sciences as a system of formalisms in
Part One and shall return to the subject in the next chapter.</p>
<p>To the descriptive sciences, like zoology and botany, we can advance,
as has been hinted already, from a more primitive level of articulation,
relying only on rudimentary or at any rate quite informal logical
operations. These sciences are an expansion of ordinary speech by the
addition of a scientific nomenclature, while the symbolic operation on
which they mainly rely is the systematic accumulation of recorded
knowledge, and the rearranging and reconsidering of these records from
new points of view.</p>
<p>Yet even here the process of articulation has rendered immensely
effective assistance to our native mnemonic powers. Man is not much
superior to a rat in finding his way in a maze; and it is not clear that
he possesses in other ways either much greater native intelligence than
the animal for reorganizing remembered experiences. But the bare unaided
memory of animals can only collect scraps of information,
unsystematically; nor could man do much better, but for the power of
systematization dependent on speech. And even so, not until the
invention of printing enormously speeded up the reproduction of records
and made them much more compendious, could descriptive zoology and
botany expand from the Aristotelian and medieval natural history
covering a few hundred types to a systematic science comprising millions
of species.</p>
<p>Decisive assistance is rendered to memory by the compilation of
manageable records also in the great domains of humanistic scholarship
such as history, literature and law, to which I may refer in passing,
though my programme has excluded for the time being the class of
interpersonal articulation to which these branches of scholarship
belong. Their progress depends altogether on the expansion of printed
records derived from the renewed exploration of primary sources, which
themselves are largely printed records or printed literary works. Books
setting out such information concisely and libraries which make the
books readily accessible are decisive in enlarging the opportunities of
such scholarship.</p>
<p>Allied to the mnemonic services of articulation is their capacity for
assisting the speculative imagination of the inventor. The inventor’s
sketchbook is his laboratory. There is a standard experiment to test
inventiveness, in which a person is confronted with two ropes hanging
from the ceiling and almost reaching to the floor, the points of
suspension being so far apart that while holding the end of either rope
in one hand you cannot reach the other rope as it hangs straight down.26
The task is to tie the two ends of the ropes together. People who failed
to discover how to do this, readily found the solution when they drew a
picture on paper of the arrangement set up in front of them.
Articulation pictures the essentials of a situation on a reduced scale,
which lends itself more easily to imaginative manipulation than the
ungainly original; it thereby makes possible a science of
engineering.</p>
<p>Thus the joint application of the two operational principles of
language can be seen to expand speech into the texts of science and
technology. But the invention of suitable symbols and their manipulation
according to fixed rules can transcend altogether the task of dealing
with matters of experience. Processes of inference, conducted by
symbolic operations, can be carried out without reference to actually
counted or measured entities, and such inferences may be interesting.
Hence pure mathematics is possible.</p>
<p>Like chessmen, the symbols of pure mathematics stand not, or not
necessarily, for anything denoted by them, but primarily for the use
that can be made of them according to known rules. The mathematical
symbol embodies the conception of its operability, just as a bishop or a
knight in chess embodies the conception of the moves of which it is
capable. The invention of new mathematical symbols which can be used in
a more interesting or practically more effective manner has been going
on through the centuries. The conception of numbers is present already
in animals, but, by successive symbolic inventions, man has developed it
far beyond its original range of six to eight integers. The advent of
positional notation, of arabic numerals, of the zero sign and the
decimal point, have facilitated the invention of arithmetical operations
which have both greatly enriched our notion of numbers, and made the
practical application of numbers for counting and measuring more
powerful.</p>
<p>A notation invented by one mathematician may suggest to another some
interesting variation of the corresponding conception. Laplace remarks
how fortunate was Descartes’ notation of the exponent of a power in
stimulating speculations about the possibility of other than positive
integer powers.27 Some questions of number theory had long remained
unapproachable On account of the forbidding labour of the computations
required to explore them, until the construction of electronic computers
speeded up these manipulations many thousand times. Thus the progress of
mathematics depends greatly on the invention of expressive and easily
manipulable symbols for the representation of mathematical
conceptions.</p>
<p>The rise of formal logic resembles the advances made in pure
mathematics by the advent of happy symbolic innovations. Logical symbols
allow us to state clearly such complex sentences as would be quite
incomprehensible in ordinary language. The range of manageable
grammatical structures being thus vastly increased, we can also perform
in these terms feats of deductive argument which could not conceivably
be attempted otherwise. This has opened up a new domain of inferences of
such ingenuity and profundity as to be worth serious cultivation for its
own sake.</p>
<p>The surprisingly varied terms in which systems of algebra or geometry
can be interpreted, demonstrate the tenuousness of their denotative
functions. They do not refer to particular things and may be altogether
empty categories, well defined, but applying to nothing. Thus the
infinite set ℵ counts all numbers, the next larger infinite sets ℵ1 and
ℵ2 count respectively all geometrical points and all conceivable curves,
but the sets ℵ3, ℵ4 . . . etc. are infinitely larger than any set of
objects so far conceived, and so they apply to nothing definite at
all—without being disqualified thereby as mathematical entities. These
self-contained systems of pure mathematics may tell us something which
is important, without primarily referring to anything outside
themselves. Thus the second operational principle of articulation
predominates here altogether over the first. Indeed, mathematics deploys
the highest powers of this principle and testifies to our pleasure in
exercising these powers. Of this intellectual passion, which is
essential to mathematics, I shall say more in the next chapter.</p>
<p>We have now before us the following sequence of sciences relying
decreasingly on the first and increasingly on the second operational
principle of language: (1) the descriptive sciences, (2) the exact
sciences, (3) the deductive sciences. It is a sequence of increasing
formalization and symbolic manipulation, combined with decreasing
contact with experience. Higher degrees of formalization make the
statements of science more precise, its inferences more impersonal and
correspondingly more ‘reversible’; but every step towards this ideal is
achieved by a progressive sacrifice of content. The immense wealth of
living shapes governed by the descriptive sciences is narrowed down to
bare pointer-readings for the purpose of the exact sciences, and
experience vanishes altogether from our direct sight as we pass on to
pure mathematics.</p>
<p>There is a corresponding variation in the tacit coefficient of
speech. In order to describe experience more fully language must be less
precise. But greater imprecision brings more effectively into play the
powers of inarticulate judgment required to resolve the ensuing
indeterminacy of speech. So it is our personal participation that
governs the richness of concrete experience to which our speech can
refer. Only by the aid of this tacit coefficient could we ever say
anything at all about experience—a conclusion I have reached already by
showing that the process of denotation is itself unformalizable.</p>
