<h4 id="the-educated-mind">8. THE EDUCATED MIND</h4>
<p>By the time these pages appear in print, Donald Kellogg may have
completed his studies at a university. He may be on his way to becoming
a capable doctor, lawyer or clergyman, destined perhaps to become an
authority on medicine, law or theology, or even a pioneer whose
greatness will only dawn on generations yet to come—while Gua the
chimpanzee, his playmate and intellectual rival until the age of a year
and a half, will never have got beyond the stage of intelligence which
they both reached as infants. Donald has acquired all his superior
knowledge by the exercise of inarticulate powers—exceeding those of Gua
mainly in the capacity for combining the practical, observational and
interpretative endowments which they both shared—for setting in motion
the operational principles of speech, of print and of other linguistic
symbols, and perhaps even enlarging this heritage of knowledge by
discoveries of his own.</p>
<p>Knowledge acquired by education may be of various kinds. It may be
medical knowledge, legal knowledge, etc., or simply the general
knowledge of an educated person. We are clearly aware of the extent and
special character of our knowledge, even though focally aware of hardly
any of its innumerable items. Of these particulars we are aware only in
terms of our mastery of the subject of which they form part. This sense
of mastery is similar in kind to the inarticulate knowledge of knowing
one’s way about a complex topography, but its range is enhanced by the
aid of verbal and other linguistic pointers, the peculiar manageability
of which enables us to keep track of an immense amount of experience and
to rest assured of having access, when required, to many of its
countless particulars. Consciousness of our education resides
ultimately, therefore, in our conceptual powers, whether applied
directly to experience or mediated by a system of linguistic references.
Education is latent knowledge, of which we are aware subsidiarily in our
sense of intellectual power based on this knowledge.</p>
<p>The power of our conceptions lies in identifying new instances of
certain things that we know. This function of our conceptual framework
is akin to that of our perceptive framework, which enables us to see
ever new objects as such, and to that of our appetites, which enables us
to recognize ever new things as satisfying to them. It appears likewise
akin to the power of practical skills, ever keyed up to meet new
situations. We may comprise this whole set of faculties—our conceptions
and skills, our perceptual framework and our drives—in one comprehensive
power of anticipation.</p>
<p>Owing to the unceasing changes which at every moment manifestly renew
the state of things throughout the world, our anticipations must always
meet things that are to some extent novel and unprecedented. Thus we
find ourselves relying jointly on our anticipations and on our capacity
ever to re-adapt these to novel and unprecedented situations. This is
true in the exercise of skills, in the shaping of our perception and
even in the satisfaction of appetites; every time our existing framework
deals with an event anticipated by it, it has to modify itself to some
extent accordingly. And this is even more true of the educated mind; the
capacity continually to enrich and enliven its own conceptual framework
by assimilating new experience is the mark of an intelligent
personality. Thus our sense of possessing intellectual control over a
range of things, always combines an anticipation of meeting certain
things of this kind which will be novel in some unspecifiable respects,
with a reliance on ourselves to interpret them successfully by
appropriately modifying our framework of anticipations.</p>
<p>This is no truism, but the very heart of our subject. The oddity of
our thoughts in being much deeper than we know and in disclosing their
major import unexpectedly to later minds, has been acknowledged in my
first chapter as a token of objectivity. Copernicus anticipated in part
the discoveries of Kepler and Newton, because the rationality of his
system was an intimation of a reality incompletely revealed to his eyes.
Similarly, John Dalton (and long before him the numerous precursors of
his atomic theory) beheld and described the dim outline of a reality
which modern atomic physics has since disclosed in precisely discernible
particulars. We know also that mathematical conceptions often disclose
their deeper significance only to later generations, by revealing yet
unsuspected implications or undergoing a surprising generalization.
Moreover, a mathematical formalism may be operated in ever new,
uncovenanted ways, and force on our hesitant minds the expression of a
novel conception. These major intellectual feats demonstrate on a large
scale the powers which I have claimed for all our conceptions, namely of
making sense beyond any specifiable expectations in respect to
unprecedented situations.</p>
<p>Why do we entrust the life and guidance of our thoughts to our
conceptions? Because we believe that their manifest rationality is due
to their being in contact with domains of reality, of which they have
grasped one aspect. This is why the Pygmalion at work in us when we
shape a conception is ever prepared to seek guidance from his own
creation; and yet, in reliance on his contact with reality, is ready to
re-shape his creation, even while he accepts its guidance. We grant
authority over ourselves to the conceptions which we have accepted,
because we acknowledge them as intimations—derived from the contact we
make through them with reality—of an indefinite sequence of novel future
occasions, which we may hope to master by developing these conceptions
further, relying on our own judgment in its continued contact with
reality. The paradox of self-set standards is re-cast here into that of
our subjective self-confidence in claiming to recognize an objective
reality. This brings nearer by a great step the final conception of
truth within which I shall seek to establish my balance of mind. But let
me proceed with the subject on hand a little further for the moment.</p>
