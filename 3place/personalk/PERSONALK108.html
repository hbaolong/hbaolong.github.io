<h4 id="trueness-to-type">2. TRUENESS TO TYPE</h4>
<p>The lowest manifestation of individual life—but not the least
wonderful—is its manner of appearance, in shapely forms, ruled by
specific standards. The meaning of such harmonious being and our
appreciation of its significance are two allied forms of life. For the
appreciation of harmonious beings is, just like the enjoyment of a work
of art, itself a harmonious being. Our contemplation of living beings
finds a justification in itself—a justification derived from the
significance which it accords to the living beings that it contemplates,
as beings in themselves.</p>
<p>There is a science—a descriptive science—which undertakes the
classification of living beings according to shapes. This most ancient
form of botany and zoology goes today by the technical name of
taxonomy.2 The basic performance of the taxonomist is actually practised
every day without any scientific aid, whenever we identify a cat, a
primrose or a man. Even animals have this capacity, and can exercise it
even in respect of a species which has normally no vital interest for
them, whether as a menace or as a quarry. Lorenz found that young birds
who fix their filial sentiments on a human being will show the same
attitude towards all members of the human race.3</p>
<p>Common Law makes the crime of murder, and punishment for murder,
dependent on the human shape of the individual whose death has been
caused. It demands that through all its variations—caused by differences
of age and race, by malformations and mutilations, or by ravaging
disease—we should always identify the presence of the human shape. Nor
does this demand seem excessive, since no case is known in which an
accused has pleaded failure to recognize the human shape of an
individual he had killed.</p>
<p>Yet it would seem impossible to devise a definition which would
unambiguously specify the range over which human shape may, and beyond
which it may not, vary; and it is certain that those who recognize this
shape are not in possession of any such explicit definition. Instead,
they have exercised their art of knowing by forming a conception of the
human shape. They have trusted themselves to identify noticeably
different instances of what—in spite of these differences—they judge to
be the same features, and to discriminate in other cases between things
which, in spite of some similarities, they judge to be instances of
different features. Sustained by the belief that a human type exists,
they have continued to build up their conception of it by noticing human
beings as instances of this type. In doing this, they have practised the
kind of power used for generating a focal awareness of a comprehensive
entity from a subsidiary awareness of its parts.</p>
<p>I have already acknowledged my belief in the competence of this power
of personal knowing, and said that it will be found to predominate in
the descriptive sciences. I have endorsed especially our competence for
classifying things—and living beings in particular—according to criteria
which we believe to be rational, and to expect that the classes thus
formed will prove real in the future, by revealing an indefinite range
of uncovenanted common properties.4</p>
<p>Let me repeat now also that, by acknowledging that a specimen is
normal, the biologist appraises an achievement on a scale of merit that
he had set up for the specimen in question. This process is similar to
the appreciation of individual crystals as specimens of the
crystallographic class to which they are thought to belong. But even
apart from the important fact that its objects have a centre of
individuality, biology differs from crystallography in that the
biologist’s standards are empirical. They are not deduced from a single
highly generalized assumption, based on a summary experience of the
specimens in question, but are shaped piecemeal by a series of
conceptual decisions, made by a close observation of every new specimen
to be subsumed under the species to which it is thought to belong.5 Thus
every time a specimen is appraised, the standards of normality are
somewhat modified so as to make them approximate more closely to what is
truly normal for the species.6 These standards are themselves subject to
appraisal by the biologist. He will regard some species as well-defined,
others as uncertain or altogether spurious. He will apply similar
standards also to supra-specific groupings, such as genera, families,
orders, classes; and he will apply them to the entire classificatory
systems of which these form part.</p>
<p>The most important difference of value lies here between an
artificial and a natural classification. The Linnean classification of
plants according to the number and arrangement of stamens and carpels
was excellent for the practical purpose of discriminating species and
filing away specimens. But it was an artificial system, elegant, but
lacking in real scientific beauty. Linnaeus knew that this system was
not natural, and laboured relentlessly to replace it by one that would
reveal the true kinship between species according to their nature.
Linnaeus believed species to be immutably fixed;7 yet he clearly
appreciated the deeper significance of a Natural Classification, the
discovery of which he thought the Alpha and Omega of Systematic Botany.
He said that while artificial systems serve to distinguish one plant
from another, natural systems serve to teach the nature of plants.8</p>
<p>The effort made by Linnaeus himself to establish natural
classifications both for plants and animals was successfully resumed
about half a century later by A. P. de Candolle for plants, and by
Lamarck and Cuvier for animals. Subsequent work has enormously expanded,
but not changed fundamentally, the principles of these natural
classifications; indeed, the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species
in 1859 revealed a deeper meaning of this system than its authors had
ever clearly envisaged. The hierarchy of the two kingdoms of plants and
animals, with their subordinate Classes, Orders, Families, Genera and
Species, was reinterpreted here as the branches of a family tree, the
successive stages of which could be verified by paleontology.</p>
<p>Some idea of the size and complexity of this system may be gleaned
from the estimates of the number of species into which our contemporary
fauna and flora are divided, and the number of classes formed by these
species. A standard textbook published in 1953 estimates that there are
1,120,000 known species of animals,9 forming 30 phyla and 68 classes;10
while G. N. Jones estimated in 1951 the number of known plant species at
350,000.11</p>
<p>One might expect to find this grandiose achievement celebrated
wherever biology—the science of animals and plants—is taught and
cherished. But no; classical taxonomy has almost ceased to count as a
science. The explanation seems to lie in a change in the valuation of
knowledge. It is due to a steadily mounting distaste for certain forms
of knowing and being; a growing reluctance to credit ourselves with the
capacity for personal knowing, and a corresponding unwillingness to
recognize the reality of the unspecifiable entities established by such
knowing.12</p>
<p>For taxonomy is based on connoisseurship. The nature of this faculty
can be best recognized in a great naturalist who displayed it to a high
degree. Take Sir Joseph Hooker. In 1859 he brought together and
published evidence of nearly 8000 species of flowering plants in
Australia, more than 7000 of which he himself had collected, seen and
catalogued.13 The 8000 generic entities which Hooker derived from the
individual specimens coming under his notice, have been recognized as
valid in the vast majority of cases by subsequent observations of
botanists. Of Hooker’s special gifts it was said: ’Few, if indeed any,
have ever known or will ever know plants as he did. . . . He knew his
plants personally.’14</p>
<p>More recently, C. F. A. Pantin has described how a new species of
worm is discovered</p>
<p>by a peculiar feeling of discomfort that something is not quite
right, followed by a sudden detection of the error and simultaneous
realization that it is highly significant—‘It is a Rhynchodemus all
right, but it is not bilineatus—it is an entirely new species!’</p>
<p>Pantin calls this mode of identification an ‘aesthetic recognition’
by contrast to a systematic recognition based on key features. He shows
that the former predominates in field work.15</p>
<p>Once a species is established it is usually defined by the presence
of certain distinctive key features. But these key features themselves
are variable in shape, and hence reference to them represents once more
a claim to the identification of a typical shape in its variable
instances. This was made clear at the Fifth International Botanical
Congress, held in Cambridge in 1930, partly for the purpose of finding a
definition for a species. The features of plants are characterized by
different authors as ‘ovate, oval, patent, hirsute, ciliate . . .’ but
these authors may have quite different attributes in mind, said A. J.
Wilmott. ’The lanceolate of Linnaeus (he continued) is very different
from that of Lindley. . . . No two of my colleagues draw the same form
of lanceolate.’16 The knowledge of key features is invaluable as a maxim
for the identification of specimens, but like all maxims it is useful
only to those who possess the art of applying it.17</p>
<p>But the exercise of such exceptional skill weakens the position of
the scientist today in the eyes of scientific opinion and tends to
depreciate both his knowledge and its subject matter. The exceptionally
high degree of connoisseurship required for establishing a species,
combined with the enormous extension of the domain over which it is to
be exercised and the comparative shallowness of the knowledge thus
acquired, lays the taxonomist open to the charge of indulging in merely
subjective imaginings. When members of the Fifth International Botanical
Congress declared that ‘the concept of most species must rest on the
judgment and experience of the individual taxonomist’,18 they invited
this criticism. Reflecting on this discussion on the definition of a
species, S. C. Harland recalled how in Fanny’s First Play, by Bernard
Shaw, the dramatic critic replies to the question whether the play was a
good play, that if the play was by a good author, then it was a good
play. ‘The situation would appear to be somewhat similar’, writes
Harland, ’in regard to what constitutes a species.’19</p>
<p>I would suggest that the answer lies behind the Shavian joke itself.
Just as plays written by good writers are, as a rule (though, of course,
not always) good plays, so species described by good systematists are as
a rule good species. In other words: owing to their acknowledged skill,
good playwrights and good systematists alike enjoy considerable
authority. This is conspicuous for both kinds of authors, because the
rules by which they work and by which their work is judged are extremely
delicate and altogether unspecifiable. Only if you refuse to accept any
such highly unspecifiable knowledge, so that you renounce altogether the
possibility of knowing a good play or a good species—and wipe out
thereby the very conception of a good playwright or a good
systematist—can you repudiate also the authority of any such
persons.</p>
<p>Of course, the widespread distaste for the inexactitude of systematic
morphology, which Professor Harland expresses here, issues in no demand
for denying the existence of different animals and plants of typical
shapes and structures. Professor Harland (and other scientists
expressing similar tendencies) would only wish to recast the concept of
species in the more impersonal terms of genetics. Thus defined, a
species (a ‘geno-species’) would be formed by a world population of an
organism, where there is—or is at least believed to be—a potentiality
for an exchange of chromosomal material throughout the entire
population.20 However, the genetic investigation of a population
presupposes its morphological distinctness. The task of observing the
process and the outcome of interbreeding within a given population is
difficult enough and often quite impracticable for the vast majority of
known morphological species. To undertake genetic experiments
irrespective of morphological differences, with the intention of
establishing from these alone the boundaries of specificity, would be
absurd. It has certainly never been contemplated.</p>
<p>The same is true of all other tests that have been recently suggested
with a view to placing taxonomy on more objective foundations. Thanks to
the work of I. Manton, cytology has yielded very interesting corrections
and amplifications of the morphological system of ferns.21 But, once
more, the range of such tests is comparatively limited, and above all,
it has to rely on the existing morphological system for its
guidance.</p>
<p>It all comes down to this. If you want to bring order into the
multitude of animals and plants on earth, you must first of all look at
them. Many thousands of millions of insects are crawling, swimming,
burrowing and hopping all over the world and they fall into about
800,000 species. To apply any kind of test for identifying and
discriminating these teeming multitudes, without paying attention to
their characteristic shapes and markings, would be obviously
impossible.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody has suggested this. Projects for the application of
additional, and in particular more objective, taxonomic tests, have all
set themselves their tasks within the existing morphological system.
They propose to amend it or merely to understand it better, by bringing
to bear on the existing system the methods of other branches of biology,
whether the more objective tests of genetics and cytology, or the
descriptive methods of anatomy, physiology, histology, ecology, phyto-
and zoo-geography, etc. This would certainly not abolish Natural History
in favour of a system based on objective tests. Yet the deprecation of
the original conception of Natural History as a contemplative, rather
than an analytical, achievement persist throughout modern biology.22</p>
<p>Not that the joy of seeing animals and plants and of entering into
their forms of existence, by carefully studying their shapes and
behaviour, is extinct among the naturalists of our time. Far from it;
listen to K. Z. Lorenz:</p>
<p>I confidently assert (he writes) that no man, even if he were endowed
with a superhuman patience, could physically bring himself to stare at
fishes, birds or mammals, as persistently as is necessary in order to
take stock of the behaviour patterns of a species, unless his eyes were
bound to the object of his observation in that spellbound gaze which is
not motivated by any conscious effort to gain knowledge, but by that
mysterious charm that the beauty of living creatures works on some of
us!23</p>
<p>Indeed, biology remains the study of living beings, deriving its
value ultimately from the intrinsic interest of living things—a general
human interest which Natural History has immensely widened and deepened.
Experimental studies made on animals and plants remain meaningless,
except through their bearing on animals and plants as known to us by
ordinary experience and through Natural History.</p>
<p>Of course, the scientific study of a subject matter may justifiably
destroy our interest in it if it proves that the matter is in fact
illusory. Astronomy, which started in Babylonian times as part of
astrology, eventually proved astrology to be illusory; and the study of
chemistry, originally initiated within the framework of alchemy, finally
discredited and replaced alchemy. If experimental biology could
discredit the existence of animals and plants—or at least prove that
their alleged typical shapes and their systematic classifications are
illusory—in the sense in which the shapes of constellations are
illusory—then experimental biology might indeed supersede Natural
History and be studied for its own sake, without bearing on Natural
History. To aim at this would no doubt be foolish, but at least it would
be consistent. Instead, we meet with the typical device of modern
intellectual prevarication, first systematized by Kant in his regulative
principles. Knowledge that we hold to be true and also vital to us, is
made light of, because we cannot account for its acceptance in terms of
a critical philosophy. We then feel entitled to continue using that
knowledge, even while flattering our sense of intellectual superiority
by disparaging it. And we actually go on, firmly relying on this
despised knowledge to guide and lend meaning to our more exact
enquiries, while pretending that these alone come up to our standards of
scientific stringency.</p>
<p>If consistently carried out, the denial of contemplative value in
science would cut off biology from the intellectual passions from which
it takes its origin, and could not stop short of denying altogether
scientific reality to the beings in which life manifests itself. Of
course, biology may continue to flourish vigorously (as other branches
of science have done) by wisely disregarding its own professed
philosophy. But we shall see, as we proceed further, that this cannot be
altogether relied upon.</p>
