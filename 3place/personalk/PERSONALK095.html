<h4 id="the-structure-of-commitment-i">5. THE STRUCTURE OF COMMITMENT:
I</h4>
<p>We have seen that the thought of truth implies a desire for it, and
is to that extent personal. But since such a desire is for something
impersonal, this personal motive has an impersonal intention. We avoid
these seeming contradictions by accepting the framework of commitment,
in which the personal and the universal mutually require each other.
Here the personal comes into existence by asserting universal intent,
and the universal is constituted by being accepted as the impersonal
term of this personal commitment.</p>
<p>Such a commitment enacts the paradox of dedication. In it a person
asserts his rational independence by obeying the dictates of his own
conscience, that is, of obligations laid down for himself by himself.
Luther defined the situation by declaring, ‘Here I stand and cannot
otherwise’. These words could have been uttered by a Galileo, a Harvey
or an Elliotson, and they are equally implied in the stand made by any
pioneer of art, thought, action or faith. Any devotion entails an act of
self-compulsion.</p>
<p>We can watch the mechanism of commitment operating on a minor scale,
and yet revealing all its characteristic features, in the way a judge
decides a novel case. His discretion extends over the possible
alternatives left open to him by the existing explicit framework of the
law, and within this area he must exercise his personal judgment. But
the law does not admit that it fails to cover any conceivable case.6 By
seeking the right decision the judge must find the law, supposed to be
existing—though as yet unknown. This is why eventually his decision
becomes binding as law. The judge’s discretion is thus narrowed down to
zero by the stranglehold of his own universal intent—by the power of his
responsibility over himself. This is his independence. It consists in
keeping himself wholly responsible to the interests of justice,
excluding any subjectivity, whether of fear or favour. Judicial
independence has been secured, where it exists, by centuries of
passionate resistance to intimidation and corruption; for justice is an
intellectual passion seeking satisfaction of itself, by inspiring and
ruling men’s lives.</p>
<p>While compulsion by force or by neurotic obsession excludes
responsibility, compulsion by universal intent establishes
responsibility. The strain of this responsibility is the greater—other
things being equal—the wider the range of alternatives left open to
choice and the more conscientious the person responsible for the
decision. While the choices in question are open to arbitrary egocentric
decisions, a craving for the universal sustains a constructive effort
and narrows down this discretion to the point where the agent making the
decision finds that he cannot do otherwise. The freedom of the
subjective person to do as he pleases is overruled by the freedom of the
responsible person to act as he must.7</p>
<p>The course of scientific discovery resembles the process of reaching
a difficult judicial decision—and the analogy throws light on a crucial
issue of the theory of knowledge. Discovery stands in the same contrast
to a routine survey, as does a novel court decision to the routine
administration of law. In both cases the innovator has a wide discretion
of choice, because he has no fixed rules to rely on, and the range of
his discretion determines the measure of his personal responsibility. In
both cases a passionate search for a solution that is regarded as
potentially pre-existing, narrows down discretion to zero and issues at
the same time in an innovation claiming universal acceptance. In both
cases the original mind takes a decision on grounds which are
insufficient to minds lacking similar powers of creative judgment. The
active scientific investigator stakes bit by bit his whole professional
life on a series of such decisions and this day-to-day gamble represents
his most responsible activity. The same is true of the judge, with the
difference, of course, that the risk is borne here mainly by the parties
to the case and by the society which has entrusted itself to the
interpretation of its laws by the courts.</p>
<p>I have described before the principle which determines heuristic
choices in the process of scientific research as a sense of growing
proximity to a hidden truth, like that which guides us in groping for a
forgotten name. Within the framework of commitment this determining
force reappears now as a sense of responsibility exercised with
universal intent. Scientific intuition is evoked by a strenuous groping
towards an unknown achievement, believed to be hidden and yet
accessible. Therefore, though every choice in a heuristic process is
indeterminate in the sense of being an entirely personal judgment, in
those who exercise such judgment competently it is completely determined
by their responsibility in respect to the situation confronting them. In
so far as they are acting responsibly, their personal participation in
drawing their own conclusions is completely compensated for by the fact
that they are submitting to the universal status of the hidden reality
which they are trying to approach. Accidents may sometimes bring
about—or prevent—discovery, but research does not rely on accident: the
continuously renewed risks of failure normally incurred at every
heuristic step are taken without ever acting at random. Responsible
action excludes randomness, even as it suppresses egocentric
arbitrariness.</p>
<p>Yet the explorer gambles for indefinite stakes. Columbus sailed out
to find a Western route to the Indies; he failed and after repeating his
voyage three times to prove that he had reached the Indies, he died in
shame. Still, Columbus did not merely blunder into America. He was wrong
in accepting on the evidence of the prophecies of Esdras and,
presumably, of Toscanelli’s map, that the westward distance of the
Indies from Spain was only about twice that of the Azores, but he was
right in concluding that the East could be reached from the West.8 He
staked his life and reputation on what appear now to be insufficient
grounds for an unattainable prize, but he won another prize instead, far
greater than he was ever to realize. He had committed himself to a
belief which we now recognize as a small distorted fragment of the
truth, but which impelled him to make a move in the right direction.
Such wide uncertainties of its aims are attached to every great
scientific enquiry. They are implicit in the looseness of the hold which
a daring anticipation of reality has upon it. I have described before
how the scientist must strike a balance between the opposite hazards of
caution and daring—either of which might waste his gifts—so as to make
the best use of these gifts. Scientists who rely on themselves to decide
on this in a responsible manner—and their supporters who in their turn
rely on them—believe that this is feasible, and I agree with them. I
have implied this at the opening of this chapter by declaring my belief
that, in spite of the appalling hazards, I am called upon to search for
the truth and state my findings. My confident description of the
heuristic commitment of scientists endorses here a similar belief, held
by men of science pursuing their researches.</p>
<p>The science of today serves as a heuristic guide for its own further
development. It conveys a conception about the nature of things which
suggests to the enquiring mind an inexhaustible range of surmises. The
experience of Columbus, who so fatefully misjudged his own discovery, is
inherent to some extent in all discovery. The implications of new
knowledge can never be known at its birth. For it speaks of something
real, and to attribute reality to something is to express the belief
that its presence will yet show up in an indefinite number of
unpredictable ways.</p>
<p>An empirical statement is true to the extent to which it reveals an
aspect of reality, a reality largely hidden to us, and existing
therefore independently of our knowing it. By trying to say something
that is true about a reality believed to be existing independently of
our knowing it, all assertions of fact necessarily carry universal
intent. Our claim to speak of reality serves thus as the external
anchoring of our commitment in making a factual statement.</p>
<p>The framework of commitment is now established in outline for this
particular case. The enquiring scientist’s intimations of a hidden
reality are personal. They are his own beliefs, which—owing to his
originality—as yet he alone holds. Yet they are not a subjective state
of mind, but convictions held with universal intent, and heavy with
arduous projects. It was he who decided what to believe, yet there is no
arbitrariness in his decision. For he arrived at his conclusions by the
utmost exercise of responsibility. He has reached responsible beliefs,
born of necessity, and not changeable at will. In a heuristic
commitment, affirmation, surrender and legislation are fused into a
single thought, bearing on a hidden reality.</p>
<p>To accept commitment as the only relation in which we can believe
something to be true, is to abandon all efforts to find strict criteria
of truth and strict procedures for arriving at the truth. A result
obtained by applying strict rules mechanically, without committing
anyone personally, can mean nothing to anybody. Desisting henceforth
from the vain pursuit of a formalized scientific method, commitment
accepts in its place the person of the scientist as the agent
responsible for conducting and accrediting scientific discoveries. The
scientist’s procedure is of course methodical. But his methods are but
the maxims of an art which he applies in his own original way to the
problem of his own choice. Discovery forms part of the art of knowing;
it can be studied by precept and example, but its higher performances
require peculiar native gifts appropriate to particular subjects. Every
factual statement embodies some measure of responsible judgment as the
personal pole of the commitment in which it is affirmed.</p>
<p>We meet here once more the position which the Logic of Affirmation
assigned to the intelligent person, who was defined there as the centre
of unspecifiable intelligent operations. I shall show in Part Four that
this is actually what we know as the mind of a person, when meeting and
conversing with somebody. His mind is the focus which we look at by
attending subsidiarily to the utterances and actions unspecifiably
co-ordinated by his mind. Since the structure of commitment includes the
logic of assent, it necessarily confirms this logic; yet it is worth
noting that by relying on this logic my fundamental belief implies a
belief in the existence of minds as centres of unspecifiable intelligent
operations.</p>
<p>While the logic of assent merely showed that assent is an a-critical
act, ‘commitment’ was introduced from the start as a framework in which
assent can be responsible, as distinct from merely egocentric or random.
The centre of tacit assent was elevated to the seat of responsible
judgment. It was granted thereby the faculty of exercising discretion,
subject to obligations accepted and fulfilled by itself with universal
intent. A responsible decision is reached, then, in the knowledge that
we have overruled by it conceivable alternatives, for reasons that are
not fully specifiable. Hence to accept the framework of commitment as
the only situation in which sincere affirmations can be made, is to
accredit in advance (if anything is ever to be affirmed) affirmations
against which objections can be raised that cannot be refuted. It allows
us to commit ourselves on evidence which, but for the weight of our own
personal judgment, would admit of other conclusions. We may firmly
believe what we might conceivably doubt; and may hold to be true what
might conceivably be false.</p>
<p>We reach here the decisive issue of the theory of knowledge.
Throughout this book I have persistently followed one single endeavour.
I have tried to demonstrate that into every act of knowing there enters
a tacit and passionate contribution of the person knowing what is being
known, and that this coefficient is no mere imperfection, but a
necessary component of all knowledge. All this evidence turns into a
demonstration of the utter baselessness of all alleged knowledge, unless
we can wholeheartedly uphold our own convictions, even when we know that
we might withhold our assent from them. I must yet face this issue more
fully.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>THE STRUCTURE OF COMMITMENT; II</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me return to fundamentals. In the theory of commitment the main
division lies between experiences that are merely suffered or enjoyed
and others that are actively entered upon. Convulsions or other
incoherent motions are not activities, but everything that tends towards
an achievement, whether it involves bodily motions or merely thought, is
to be classed as an activity. Only an activity can go wrong, and all
activity incurs the risk of failure. To believe something is a mental
act: you can neither believe nor disbelieve a passive experience. It
follows that you can only believe something that might be false. This is
my argument in a nutshell; I shall now elaborate it in some detail.</p>
<p>In a widest sense every process of life, even in plants, is an
activity that might miscarry. But as I am concerned here only with the
way truth is found, I shall limit myself to the conscious achievement of
knowledge. Even so, I shall have to supplement now what I have said in
the previous section about scientific discovery, by describing how
knowledge is acquired at lower levels, namely by perception and
inarticulate learning. This will include all active ‘epicritical’
knowing, but exclude purely passive, ‘proto-pathic’ awareness, which I
am classing as subjective.</p>
<p>Any act of factual knowing presupposes somebody who believes he knows
what is being believed to be known. This person is taking a risk in
asserting something, at least tacitly, about something believed to be
real outside himself. Any presumed contact with reality inevitably
claims universality. If I, left alone in the world, and knowing myself
to be alone, should believe in a fact, I would still claim universal
acceptance for it. Every act of factual knowing has the structure of a
commitment.</p>
<p>Since the two poles of commitment, the personal and the universal,
are correlative, we may expect them to arise simultaneously from an
antecedent state of selfless subjectivity. That is in fact how the
child’s early intellectual development has been described by
psychologists. The early behaviour of children suggests that they cannot
distinguish between fact and fiction, or between their own person and
another. They live in a world of their own making, which they believe to
be shared by everybody else. This stage of infancy has been called
‘autistic’ by Bleuler and ‘ego-centric’ by Piaget; but the blurred
distinction between self and non-self, which underlies the child’s state
of mind here, might as well be described as ‘selfless’. So long, or in
so far, as the external and internal worlds of a person do not interfere
with each other, there can be no conflict between them and hence no
attempt can be made to avoid such a conflict by discovering a correct
interpretation of the world. Nor can any risk be taken in the pursuit of
such a discovery. Only as we become divided from the world, can we
achieve a personhood capable of committing itself consciously to beliefs
concerning the world, and incurring thereby a fiduciary hazard. Autistic
day-dreaming can then give way to acts of deliberate judgment.</p>
<p>The person that emerges at this level of commitment is only the ego,
exercising discrimination, though lacking as yet responsible judgment.
But we shall see later that even at this level an individual can be
puzzled by a problem, to the point of suffering a nervous breakdown. His
whole person is involved in his commitment; the effort of reaching out
to reality involves, even here, compulsion of oneself to make oneself
conform to reality.</p>
<p>Perception usually goes on automatically, but sometimes situations
may present themselves in which all the senses are strained to the
utmost in order to discriminate between two or more alternatives. If we
then decide to see things in one particular way, we blot out any
alternative vision of them for the moment. Experimental psychology
provides examples of ambiguities between which our perception can decide
at will. A flight of steps can be seen alternatively as an overhanging
cornice. We may see two people facing each other on either side of a
picture, or alternatively, a vase standing in the middle of the
picture.9 The eye may be able to switch at will from one way of seeing
such a picture to the other, but cannot keep its interpretation
suspended between the two. The only way to avoid being committed in
either way, is to close one’s eyes. This corresponds to the conclusion
reached before in my critique of doubt; to avoid believing one must stop
thinking.</p>
<p>So we see that even a primitive tacit act like perception may operate
deliberately in search of the truth over an area of discretion, within
which it overrules even more primitive, i.e. less discriminating, mental
propensities. There is, indeed, complete continuity between a perceptive
judgment and the process by which we establish responsible convictions
in the course of scientific research. The assent which shapes knowledge
is fully determined in both cases by competent mental efforts overruling
arbitrariness. The result may be erroneous, but it is the best that can
be done in the circumstances. Since every factual assertion is
conceivably mistaken, it is also conceivably corrigible, but a competent
judgment cannot be improved by the person who is making it at the moment
of making it, since he is already doing his best in making it.</p>
<p>We cannot evade this logical necessity by suggesting that the mental
act should be postponed until its grounds have been more fully
considered. For every deliberate mental act has to decide its own
timing. The risks of further hesitation must be weighed against the
risks of acting hastily. The balance of the two must be left to be
derived from the circumstances, as known to the person making up his
mind. Hence an agent exercising a mental act competently with a view to
the existing circumstances cannot, at the moment of acting, correct it
as to its timing any more than as to its content.10 To postpone mental
decisions on account of their conceivable fallibility would necessarily
block all decisions for ever, and pile up the hazards of hesitation to
infinity. It would amount to voluntary mental stupor. Stupor alone can
eliminate both belief and error.</p>
<p>Strict scepticism should deny itself the possibility of advocating
its own doctrine, since its consistent practice would preclude the use
of language, the meaning of which is subject to all the notorious
pitfalls of inductive reasoning. But strict scepticism could yet teach
an ideal which it admits to be unattainable. Or the sceptic may excuse
the imperfections of his scepticism by invoking the protection of
regulative principles, which he professes to follow without accepting
them to be true. He may thus retain his sense of intellectual
superiority over others who—like myself—profess their fiduciary
commitments without pretending that these are only temporary
imperfections.</p>
<p>I shall not argue with the sceptic. It would not be consistent with
my own views if I expected him to abandon a complete system of beliefs
on account of any particular series of difficulties. Besides, by this
time it should be clear how far-reaching are in my own opinion the
changes in outlook that are required in order to establish a stable
alternative to the objectivist position. I cannot hope to do more in
this book than to exhibit a possibility which like-minded people may
wish to explore.</p>
<p>I shall go on, therefore, to repeat my fundamental belief that, in
spite of the hazards involved, I am called upon to search for the truth
and state my findings. To accept commitment as the framework within
which we may believe something to be true, is to circumscribe the
hazards of belief. It is to establish the conception of competence which
authorizes a fiduciary choice made and timed, to the best of the acting
person’s ability, as a deliberate and yet necessary choice. The paradox
of self-set standards is eliminated, for in a competent mental act the
agent does not do as he pleases, but compels himself forcibly to act as
he believes he must. He can do no more, and he would evade his calling
by doing less. The possibility of error is a necessary element of any
belief bearing on reality, and to withhold belief on the grounds of such
a hazard is to break off all contact with reality. The outcome of a
competent fiduciary act may, admittedly, vary from one person to
another, but since the differences are not due to any arbitrariness on
the part of the individuals, each retains justifiably his universal
intent. As each hopes to capture an aspect of reality, they may all hope
that their findings will eventually coincide or supplement each
other.</p>
<p>Therefore, though every person may believe something different to be
true, there is only one truth. This can be substantiated as follows. The
function of the word ‘true’ is to complete such utterances as ‘“p” is
true’, which are equivalent to an act of assent of the form ‘I believe
p’. The question, whether a particular fact is true, e.g. whether
Dreyfus did write the bordereau, challenges a person to such an act.
Unless such a challenge is addressed to me—be it by other people or by
myself—the question whether this fact is true does not arise for me.
Questions and answers exchanged between other people on this matter are
to me merely facts about these people, and not about the matter in
question. The only sense in which I can speak of the facts of the matter
is by making up my own mind about them. In doing so I may rely on an
existing consensus, as a clue to the truth, or else may dissent from it,
for my own reasons. In either case my answer will be made with universal
intent, saying what I believe to be the truth, and what the consensus
ought therefore to be. This is the only sense in which I can speak of
the truth, and though I am the only person who can speak of it in this
sense, this is what I mean by the truth. To ask what I would believe to
be the true facts of a matter, if I were somebody else, means simply to
ask what somebody else would believe them to be. This kind of question
is interesting, and will yet be discussed later, but it is clearly not a
question concerning the facts of the matter.</p>
<p>This position is not solipsistic, since it is based on a belief in an
external reality and implies the existence of other persons who can
likewise approach the same reality. Nor is it relativistic This is
already apparent from the previous paragraph, but may be stated in more
formal terms as follows. The concept of commitment postulates that there
is no difference, except in emphasis, between saying ‘I believe p’ or
‘“p” is true’. Both utterances emphatically put into words that I am
confidently asserting p, as a fact. This is something I am doing in the
act of uttering the words in question, and is quite different from my
reporting that I have done this in the past, or that somebody else has
either done this or is doing it now. If I report ‘I believed p’ or ‘X
believes p’ I am not committing myself in respect to p and hence no
utterance linking ‘p’ to ‘true’ corresponds to these reports; they issue
in no assertion of the sentence p as true, be it in relation to my own
past or to other people’s beliefs. There remains therefore only one
truth to speak about.</p>
<p>This is as far as I can take now this question of relativism.</p>
