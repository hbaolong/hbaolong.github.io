<h4 id="living-machinery">4. LIVING MACHINERY</h4>
<p>Both plants and animals have a great many ingenious devices within
their bodies which are used for the benefit of the organism. Animals,
operating more energetically than plants, are much richer in them.
Claims for hundreds of patents could be found by describing the rational
interaction of the animal’s organs in the service of its various
interests. The operational principles defined by such patents would be
the principles of animal physiology.</p>
<p>I have analysed in the previous chapter our knowledge of machines.
They can be recognized as such only by first guessing, at least
approximately, what they are for and how they work. Their operational
principles can then be specified further by technological
investigations. Physics and chemistry can establish the conditions for
their successful operation and account for possible failures, but a
complete specification of a machine in physico-chemical terms would
dissolve altogether our knowledge of the machine.36</p>
<p>The logic of engineering applies also to physiology, but with some
modifications. The organs of the body are more complex and variable than
the parts of a machine, and their functions are also less clearly
specifiable. While considerable connoisseurship may be required to judge
the shape of a good air-screw and to diagnose any possible defect of it,
the skill needed for judging the shape of a heart and its possible
malformations is more delicate. A knowledge of the shape and location of
the organs in the whole variety of animals known to zoology forms a vast
body of morphological information; it is a descriptive science.
Moreover, any particular function can be performed in a great many ways.
In breathing, for example, the two sides of the chest, the diaphragm,
and the muscles of the neck may be used in variable co-ordinations. This
reduces the specifiability of a living performance as compared with that
of a machine and contributes once more to the descriptive character of
physiology.</p>
<p>Thus in physiology, the twofold unspecifiability of organized shapes
and of the processes occurring within them is added to the inherent
unspecifiability attached to operational principles in general, and to
this extent the logic of physiology differs from that of engineering.
Otherwise we have the same set of relations in both cases. The study of
an organ must begin with an attempt to guess what it is for and how it
works. Only then can it proceed further by combined physiological and
physico-chemical enquiries, both being conducted with a bearing on the
purposive physiological framework which they help to elucidate. Any
attempt to conduct physico-chemical investigations of a living being
irrespective of physiological assumptions will lead as a rule to
meaningless results; and any attempt to replace physiology altogether by
a physico-chemical chart of the living organism would completely
dissolve any understanding of the organism.37</p>
<p>Of course, living machinery has a purpose only in the interest of the
living individual as appraised by the observer. But it must possess this
purpose. Organs and their functions exist only in their bearing on the
presumed interest of the living individual. All physiology is
teleological, and in this sense we may speak here also of reasons and
causes. We say that the reason for having valves in the circulatory
system is to prevent the regurgitation of the blood; while we ascribe
the causes of any regurgitation, occurring in spite of these, to an
insufficiency of the valves owing to malformation or disease. Physiology
is a system of rules of rightness, and as such can account only for
health. Accordingly, we do not enquire into the causes of health—any
more than into the causes of a mathematical proof; but we do enquire
into the causes of disease, as we do into the causes of a mathematical
error.</p>
<p>Once more, as in morphology and morphogenesis, the existence of every
living being is acknowledged as an aim in itself; however nasty a flea
or liver fluke may be to us, we recognize the rational functioning of
its organs in their own interest. The purely scientific interest of
physiology depends, therefore, ultimately on the passions which make us
pursue Natural History. It relies on the passions which account for the
importance which we attribute to a living being in itself; on its
intrinsic interest, and on our contemplation of it as it is—and as it
ought to be.</p>
<p>According to the current theory of evolution all living machinery has
come into existence by accident and is found in existence only because
it has conferred on the individual living beings, of which it forms
part, competitive advantages which have secured the survival of their
kind. This conception of evolution (to which I shall yet return in
detail) would eliminate any true achievement from the phylogenesis of
living beings; but even so this would not affect the teleological
character of their machinelike equipment, which is logically inherent in
the conception of jointly functioning organs.</p>
