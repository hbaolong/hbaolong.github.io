<h4 id="the-magic-of-marxism">11. THE MAGIC OF MARXISM</h4>
<p>The propagandistic appeal of Marxism is the most interesting case of
(what might be called) the moral force of immorality. For it is the most
precisely formulated system having such a paradoxical appeal, and this
self-contradiction actually seems to supply the main impulse of the
Marxian movement. Isaiah Berlin, in his biography of Marx, shows him in
the act of exercising his propagandistic genius by means of this
self-contradictory principle—a prophetic idealism spurning all reference
to ideals:</p>
<p>The manuscripts of the numerous manifestos, professions of faith and
programmes of action to which he appended his name, still bear the
strokes of the pen and the fierce marginal comments, with which he
sought to obliterate all references to eternal justice, the equality of
man, the rights of individuals or nations, the liberty of conscience,
the fight for civilization, and other such phrases which were the stock
in trade . . . of the democratic movements of his time; he looked upon
these as so much worthless cant, indicating confusion of thought and
ineffectiveness in action.26</p>
<p>And indeed, it is not in spite of this contempt for justice, equality
and liberty, but because of it that Soviet Russia is accepted by many as
the true champion of these same ideals in the fight against the very
nations openly professing them. As Hannah Arendt has rightly observed
’Bolshevik assurances inside and outside Russia that they do not
recognize ordinary moral standards, have become a mainstay of Communist
propaganda. . . .’27</p>
<p>Why should so contradictory a doctrine carry such supreme convincing
power? The answer is, I believe, that it enables the modern mind,
tortured by moral self-doubt, to indulge its moral passions in terms
which also satisfy its passion for ruthless objectivity. Marxism,
through its philosophy of ‘dialectical materialism’, conjures away the
contradiction between the high moral dynamism of our age and our stern
critical passion which demands that we see human affairs objectively,
i.e. as a mechanistic process in the Laplacean manner. These antinomies,
which make the liberal mind stagger and fumble, are the joy and strength
of Marxism: for the more inordinate our moral aspirations and the more
completely amoral our objectivist outlook, the more powerful is a
combination in which these contradictory principles mutually reinforce
each other.</p>
<p>Marxism achieves this sophisticated union by a primitive mental
operation which Levy Brühl has called ‘participation’.28 For primitive
thought, in a lion tearing a villager to pieces there participates the
man’s envious neighbour; plagues and fatalities are always endowed with
the evil intentions of someone who sent them. The higher religions
sometimes interpret misfortunes as God’s retribution for past offences.
More recently, historicism has replaced God by an Historic Necessity,
credited with the easier (if even more inscrutable) role of achieving
what is historically fitting. In each case we have an active principle
immanent in a manifest event; the relation between the immanent and the
manifest being the same as between a purpose and its fulfilment, except
that the connection is here either supernatural or otherwise left
undefined.</p>
<p>To this general type of operation—and in particular its modern
variant, historicism—Marxism adds two features which greatly enhance its
scope and convincing power. First, the active principle in this case is
an aggregate of limitless moral demands, demands which have suddenly
spread all over the globe, finding response even among millions of
people who hitherto had lived in immemorial acceptance of exploitation
and squalor—while at the same time, a strictly ‘scientific’ verdict is
invoked to identify the events which are to realize and fulfil these
demands. Secondly, the mechanism of Marxism is amplified by working in
two opposite and yet mutually correlated directions. In a class society
it is material interests which are regarded as immanent in moral
aspirations: while in a socialist state the opposite holds: morality is
immanent in the material interests of the proletariat.</p>
<p>This duality may look like yet another paradoxical feature of
Marxism, but actually it can be seen to arise directly from the process
by which immanent principles are injected into manifest events. To see
this happening you must imagine that you are filled from the start—as
Marx was—with a passion for Socialism and a horror of Capitalism.
Looking in this light on the ideals of liberty, justice, brotherhood,
you will observe, for example, that the Code Napoléon, based on these
principles, was supremely effective in destroying the feudal order and
in opening the way for the bourgeoisie with its system of private
enterprise throughout Europe. You will also note that it has remained
the guardian of the capitalist order ever since. Bourgeois ideals will
appear, therefore, as a mere superstructure of capitalism, in its
opposition both to a feudalism whose rule it has subverted and to the
proletariat, whose enslavement it tries to perpetuate. Bourgeois
interests will appear to be immanent in bourgeois moral ideals. This is
the first kind of immanence, the negative branch of Marxism.</p>
<p>Think now, on the other hand, of Socialist revolutionary action. You
are filled with a passionate desire to see the workers overthrow
Capitalism and establish a realm of liberty, justice and brotherhood.
But you cannot demand this in the name of liberty, justice and
brotherhood, for you despise such emotional phrases. So you must convert
Socialism from a Utopia into a Science. You do so by affirming that the
appropriation of the means of production by ‘the proletariat’ will
release a new flow of wealth now entrammelled by Capitalism. This
affirmation satisfies the moral aspirations of Socialism, and is
accepted therefore as a scientific truth by those filled with these
aspirations. Moral passions are thereby cast in the form of a scientific
affirmation. This is the second kind of immanence, the positive branch
of Marxism. By covering them with a scientific disguise it protects
moral sentiments against being deprecated as mere emotionalism and gives
them at the same time a sense of scientific certainty; while on the
other hand it impregnates material ends with the fervour of moral
passions.</p>
<p>One can now see that both branches of Marxism operate by denying to
morality any intrinsic force of its own and that they yet both appeal in
this very act to moral passions. In the first case we are presented with
an analysis of bourgeois ideals in terms of immanent bourgeois
interests, and because the hidden motivation of this analysis is a
condemnation of capitalism, the analysis turns into an unmasking of
bourgeois hypocrisy. Since this analysis of moral claims in terms of
material interests applies quite generally, it might be thought to
discredit also the moral motives of those who do the unmasking. But
these motives are safe against unmasking, since they remain undeclared.
Indeed, acting through the unmasking of bourgeois ideologies, they
arouse powerful moral passions in others—without ever pronouncing any
moral judgment. Their propagandistic effect is achieved precisely by
enunciating the unmasking in purely scientific terms, which are thus
immune against suspicion of a moralizing purpose.</p>
<p>These supposedly scientific assertions are, of course, accepted only
because they satisfy certain moral passions. We have here a
self-confirmatory reverberation between the theory of bourgeois
ideologies and the concealed motives which underlie it. This is the
characteristic structure of what I shall call a dynamo-objective
coupling. Alleged scientific assertions, which are accepted as such
because they satisfy moral passions, will excite these passions further,
and thus lend increased convincing power to the scientific affirmations
in question—and so on, indefinitely. Moreover, such a dynamo-objective
coupling is also potent in its own defence. Any criticism of its
scientific part is rebutted by the moral passions behind it, while any
moral objections to it are coldly brushed aside by invoking the
inexorable verdict of its scientific findings. Each of the two
components, the dynamic and the objective, takes it in turn to draw
attention away from the other when it is under attack.</p>
<p>We can see that this structure underlies also a logical fallacy
exposed by the academic critics of Marxism, and explains why the fallacy
survives its exposure. The critics say that no political programme can
be derived from the Marxian prediction of the inevitable destruction of
Capitalism at the hands of the proletariat. For it is senseless to
enlist fighters for a battle which is said to be already decided; while
if the battle is not yet decided, you cannot predict its issue.29 But
within a dynamo-objective coupling, the logical objection against using
a historical prediction as an appeal to fight for the certain outcome of
history no longer arises. For the prediction is accepted only because we
believe that the Socialist cause is just; and this implies that
Socialist action is right. The prediction implies therefore a call to
action.</p>
<p>But there is more to be added here. If our sense of bad faith merely
caused us to disguise our thirst for righteousness in the erudite terms
of a specious sociology, the masquerade would perhaps be merely pitiful.
Unfortunately, moral passions undergo a fateful change when decked out
as scientific statements. I have hinted at this change already when
saying that any moral objection against Marxist action can be brushed
aside by pointing to its ‘scientific’ correctness. We can see what has
happened here: when transposed into equivalent scientific affirmations,
the moral motive of Socialism was torn from its original moral context.
It became an isolated passion, inaccessible to moral considerations.
This is fanaticism—a fanaticism fixed upon the materialistic equivalents
of the original moral passion, that is upon ‘the interests of the
working class’ or, more precisely, upon the coercive powers of those who
are held to represent the interests of the working class. It is a
fanatical cult of power.</p>
<p>This explains not only the deliberate unscrupulousness of modern
totalitarianism, but also the moral appeal of its declared resolve to
act unscrupulously. For this resolve is taken to certify that its power
embodies righteousness, and may therefore acknowledge no higher
obligation than that of defending its own supremacy, which it must do at
all costs. Those who rule in its name are entitled to scorn mercy and
honesty, not simply for reasons of expediency (as Machiavelli would
already have allowed them to do) but on account of their moral
superiority over the emotionalism, hypocrisy, and general woolliness of
their moralizing opponents. Thus sceptics who deny with contempt the
reality of all moral motivations will rally fanatically to the moral
support of naked power.</p>
<p>Once accepted, Marxism eliminates the eternally menacing discrepancy
between the universalist claims of morality and its actual dependence on
power and profit. Marxism does so by denying to morality its claims qua
morality, while offering it instead an immanent form of operation within
a specified political force. Universality is to be achieved by this
inherently righteous force through its inevitable conquest of the
world.</p>
<p>We see then that Marxism is falsely accused of materialism: its
materialism is a disguise for its moral purpose. It is true that by
their materialistic disguise these aspirations are torn out of their
moral context, and are harnessed to the service of material
aggrandizement and political violence. But this does not transform the
underlying Socialist dynamics into a desire for comfort. The fervour of
social enterprise has remained the emotional justification of Communist
governments. Hence their persistent efforts to fill all economic
activities with high moral significance; hence their gigantomania, their
neglect of the most desperate popular needs—e.g. for better housing—in
favour of ornate skyscrapers and underground marble halls; hence their
whole curious economic system which revels in production and shies away
from consumption. We in the West watch hopefully for every sign of true
materialism in Soviet Russia. For if the regime once really consented to
pursue material advantages, it would have lost its fanaticism; love of
comfort may be ignoble, but one may trust it to be accommodating.</p>
<p>The moral appeal of immorality has been effective also in other mass
movements of our time. Meinecke had detected an early form of it in
Pan-Germanism, and Hitler’s rise has confirmed that diagnosis in a
diabolically complete way. Hitler greatly profited from the Bolshevik
example, but his movement was rooted primarily in German Romantic
nihilism. This doctrine taught that an outstanding individual is a law
unto himself and may, as a statesman, unscrupulously impose his will on
the rest of the world, and that a nation has likewise the right and the
duty to fulfil its ‘historic destiny’ irrespective of moral obligations.
Such teachings contradict the universal claim of morality, just as the
Marxist-mechanistic image of man does. They identify morality with the
self-fulfilment of the individual or the nation, and this emotionally
charged utilitarianism can unite with a fierce patriotism all the
inordinate social hopes of our age. It was able eventually, therefore,
to embody both in the aim of a German world government under Hitler.</p>
<p>The immanence of great moral passions in Hitler’s programme explains
the strong moral appeal which it made by its very unscrupulousness—for
example to many members of the German Youth Movement.30 Whenever
fanaticism combines with cynicism we must suspect a dynamo-objective
coupling, and its presence is confirmed if we find that cynicism is
making a moral appeal. Hitler’s frenzy was primarily evil, but its
appeal to the German youth was moral: they accepted evil actions as a
moral duty. Their response was determined by the same convictions which
Marx had held about the nature of moral motives in public life. They
believed that such motives were mere rationalizations of power, and that
power alone was real. Hence their disgust of moralizing, and their moral
passion for unscrupulous violence.</p>
<p>In a tentative study published some years ago, I called this
principle a ‘moral inversion’.31 Such inversion can, of course, never be
completely realized. No regime, however fanatical, can act without
accepting any overt moral restraints. I have referred to this already in
describing the way naked power is bound to support—and at the same time
to limit—itself by the exercise of persuasion. On the other hand, an
element of moral inversion may be thought to be operating in every harsh
exercise of power. If ‘hard cases make bad law’, then it would seem that
the best government must occasionally commit injustices. This is true,
but occasional concessions to expediency leave unimpaired the moral
principles from which they deviate—just as the principles of moral
inversion are not denied by the mere fact that occasional concessions
are made to overt morality.</p>
