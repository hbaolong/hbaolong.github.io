<h4 id="operational-principles-of-language">3. OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF
LANGUAGE</h4>
<p>I shall now try to define the main principles by which language
becomes the instrument for the tremendous feats of articulation.</p>
<p>There are three main kinds of utterances, namely: (1) expressions of
feeling, (2) appeals to other persons, (3) statements of fact. To each
of these there corresponds a different function of language. The
transition from the tacit to the articulate which I am envisaging here
is restricted to the indicative forms of speech, as used for statements
of fact.16</p>
<p>Admittedly, language is primarily and always interpersonal and in
some degree impassioned; exclusively so in emotional expression
(passionate communication) and imperative speech (action by speech),
while even in declaratory statements of fact there is some purpose (to
communicate) and passion (to express belief). In fact, it is precisely
the ingredient of personal passion inherent in and necessary to even the
least personal forms of speech which my argument seeks to exhibit. But
the peculiar intellectual powers conferred by articulation can be
recognized more clearly if we disregard this possibility for the moment,
and attend principally to the bare indicative solitary use of
language.17 Even so, language should be taken from the start to include
writing, mathematics, graphs and maps, diagrams and pictures; in short,
all forms of symbolic representation which are used as language in the
sense defined by the subsequent description of the linguistic
process.18</p>
<p>The operational principles of language which account for the entire
intellectual superiority of men over animals seem to be twofold. The
first controls the process of linguistic representation, the second the
operation of symbols to assist the process of thought. Each principle
can be demonstrated by taking its advantages to an extreme and obviously
absurd limit of perfection, and thus exhibiting the necessity of a
restraint which had thereby been left out of account.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Suppose you wanted to improve a language by increasing its richness
indefinitely. We can get an idea of the enormous number of printed or
written words that could be formed by different combinations of phonemes
or letters, by envisaging the fact that from an alphabet of 23 letters
we could construct 238, i.e. about one hundred thousand million
eight-letter code words. This should allow us to replace each different
sentence ever printed in the English language by a different printed
word, so that this code word (which would function as a verb) would
cover what that sentence asserts. This millionfold enrichment of the
English language would completely destroy it; not only because nobody
could remember so many words, but for the more important reason that
they would be meaningless. For the meaning of a word is formed and
manifested by its repeated usage, and the vast majority of our
eight-letter code words would be used only once or at any rate too
rarely to acquire and express a definite meaning. It follows that a
language must be poor enough to allow the same words to be used a
sufficient number of times. We may call this the Law of Poverty.19</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, if ten thousand words must do duty for making ten thousand
million statements, this can be achieved only if we can form
combinations of words so that they jointly express an intended meaning.
A fixed vocabulary of sufficient poverty must therefore be used within
some fixed modes of combination, which always have the same meaning.
Only grammatically ordered word clusters can say with a limited
vocabulary the immense variety of things that are apposite to the range
of known experience.20</p>
<p>The Laws of Poverty and Grammar do not exhaust the first operational
principle of language. They refer to words, but words are not words
unless they are both identifiably repeated and consistently used. Thus,
underlying the Laws of Poverty and Grammar, we have two further
requirements: the Laws of Iteration and Consistency.</p>
<p>In order that words may be identifiably repeated in different spoken
or written sentences, phonemes and letters must be repeatable. They must
be chosen for and defined by some feature possessing the kind of
distinctiveness which Gestalt-psychology has described as prägnanz and
which I have acknowledged before, in Part One, together with other types
of order, by contrasting it with random configurations. The process of
repeating or identifying words (whether in speech or writing) can of
course never be quite free from hazards, whence arise verbal errors
which may falsify history21 or lead to permanent changes in linguistic
usage.22 Mispronunciations and the confusion of similar words are (or at
least were until recently) the stock-in-trade of music halls for making
fun of less educated people. Phonemes, scripts and words are good if
they reduce these hazards by their distinctive gestalt.23</p>
<p>If their identifiable shape distinguishes words from shapeless
utterances, like groans or squeaks, their consistent use distinguishes
them from clearly repeatable utterances—like tunes—which have no
consistent use for conveying an expression, an appeal or a statement.
Only when repeatable utterances are used consistently can they have a
definite meaning, and utterances without definite meaning are not
language. The poverty of language can fulfil its denotative functions
only if utterances are both repeatable and consistent.</p>
<p>‘Consistency’ is a deliberately imprecise term designating an
unspecifiable quality. Since the world, like a kaleidoscope, never
exactly repeats any previous situation (and indeed, if it did we would
not know it, as we would have no means of telling that time had passed
in between), we can achieve consistency only by identifying manifestly
different situations in respect to some particular feature, and this
requires a series of personal judgments. First, we must decide what
variations of our experience are irrelevant to the identification of
this recurrent feature, as forming no part of it, i.e. we must
discriminate against its random background. Secondly, we must decide
what variations should be accepted as normal changes in the appearance
of this identifiable feature, or should be taken, on the contrary, to
discredit this feature altogether as a recurrent element of experience.
Thus the Laws of Poverty and Consistency imply that every time we use a
word for denoting something, we perform and accredit our performance of
an act of generalization and that, correspondingly, the use of such a
word is taken to designate a class to which we attribute a substantial
character.</p>
<p>Moreover, by being prepared to speak in our language on future
occasions, we anticipate its applicability to future experiences, which
we expect to be identifiable in terms of the natural classes accredited
by our language. These expectations form a theory of the universe, which
we keep testing continuously as we go on talking about things. So long
as we feel that our language classifies things well, we remain satisfied
that it is right and we continue to accept the theory of the universe
implied in our language as true.</p>
<p>The nature of this universal theory which we accept by using a
language can be more clearly understood as follows. Of the 2000–3000
English words in common usage today, each occurs on the average a
hundred million times in the daily intercourse of people throughout
Britain and the United States. In a library of a million volumes using a
vocabulary of 30,000 words, the same words will recur on the average
more than a million times. A particular vocabulary of nouns, adjectives,
verbs and adverbs, thus appears to constitute a theory of all subjects
that can be talked about, in the sense of postulating that these
subjects are all constituted of comparatively few recurrent features, to
which the nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs refer.24 Such a theory is
somewhat similar to that of chemical compounds. Chemistry alleges that
the millions of different compounds are composed of a small number—about
a hundred—of persistent and identical chemical elements. Since each
element has a name and characteristic symbol attached to it, we can
write down the composition of any compound in terms of the elements
which it contains. This corresponds to writing down a sentence in the
words of a certain language. The parallel can be pushed still further.
We may regard the system of brackets used for specifying the internal
structure of a compound of given composition, as analogous to
grammatical constructions which indicate the internal relations between
the things denoted by the words composing a sentence.</p>
<p>To talk about things, we have seen, is to apply the theory of the
universe implied by our language to the particulars of which we speak.
Such talk is therefore continuous with the process described in Part
One, by which the theories of the exact sciences are brought to bear on
experience. But the connection is still closer with the descriptive
sciences to be treated later in Part Four. To classify things in terms
of features for which we have names, as we do in talking about things,
requires the same kind of connoisseurship as the naturalist must have
for identifying specimens of plants or animals. Thus the art of speaking
precisely, by applying a rich vocabulary exactly, resembles the delicate
discrimination practised by the expert taxonomist.</p>
<p>The lesson derived in Part One from reflecting on the application of
the exact sciences to experience can be extended now as follows. We have
seen that in all applications of a formalism to experience there is an
indeterminacy involved, which must be resolved by the observer on the
ground of unspecifiable criteria. Now we may say further that the
process of applying language to things is also necessarily unformalized:
that it is inarticulate. Denotation, then, is an art, and whatever we
say about things assumes our endorsement of our own skill in practising
this art. This personal coefficient of all affirmations inherent in the
use of language will be presently reconsidered in the wider context of
ineffable knowledge and ineffable thought.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The second operational principle of language can be discovered from
the absurdity of taking to its limit another manner of perfecting
language. I can best exemplify this by the process of mapping. A map is
the more accurate the nearer its scale approaches unity, but if it were
to reach unity and represent the features of a landscape in their
natural size, it would become useless, since it would be about as
difficult to find one’s way on the map as in the region represented by
it. We may conclude that linguistic symbols must be of reasonable size,
or more generally that they must consist of easily manageable objects.
The manageable size of printed language enables a single shelf holding
the Encyclopaedia Britannica to contain information ranging over all the
largest and the most minute objects in existence. Language can assist
thought only to the extent to which its symbols can be reproduced,
stored up, transported, re-arranged, and thus more easily pondered, than
the things which they denote. Churches and pyramids are symbols but they
are not language because they cannot be easily reproduced or handled. We
may call this requirement the Law of Manageability.</li>
</ol>
<p>This requirement has been anticipated already to some extent, by
assuming that we can utter the same designation on repeated occasions
and that we can compose a great number of different sentences by putting
together the same words according to certain rules. But the services of
manageability go far beyond this in enlarging the intellectual powers of
man.</p>
<p>In the most general terms, the principle of manageability consists in
devising a representation of experience which reveals new aspects of it.
This principle can be put into operation simply by writing down or
otherwise uttering a designation of an experience, from which we can
directly read off novel features of it. Alternatively, the manageability
of symbols may include their capacity to be manipulated according to
rules acknowledged as symbolic operations, or else merely to be handled
informally, as when we turn the pages of a book in order to reconsider
its subject.</p>
<p>These services of manageability to thought can all be described as
taking place in three stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Primary denotation.</p></li>
<li><p>Its reorganization.</p></li>
<li><p>The reading of the result.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Stages 2 and 3 are merged into one when reorganization occurs
mentally by a novel reading of the primary denotation.</p>
<p>Each of the three stages may be relatively trivial or else may
require various grades of ingenuity up to that of genius (of which I
shall treat later). Furthermore, the process of reorganization may be
taken to include the transposition of the primary denotation into
another set of symbols, as when numerical observations are represented
by graphs or verbal statements by equations, a process which may also
require considerable ingenuity.</p>
<p>We have seen that in the process of latent learning, described as
Type C, animals reorganize their memories of experience mentally. It
appears now that the intellectual superiority of man is due
predominantly to an extension of this power by the representation of
experience in terms of manageable symbols which he can reorganize,
either formally or mentally, for the purpose of yielding new
information. This enormously increased power of reinterpretation is of
course ultimately based on that relatively slight superiority of the
tacit powers which constitute our gift of speech. To speak is to
contrive signs, to observe their fitness, and to interpret their
alternative relations; though the animal possesses each of these three
faculties, he cannot combine them.25</p>
