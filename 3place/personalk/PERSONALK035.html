<h4 id="the-re-interpretation-of-language">9. THE RE-INTERPRETATION OF
LANGUAGE</h4>
<p>I have shown that the educated mind relies for most of its knowledge
on verbal clues. It follows, then, that its conceptual framework will be
developed mostly by listening or speaking, and that its conceptual
decisions will usually entail also a decision to understand or use words
in a novel fashion. In any case, every use of language to describe
experience in a changing world applies language to a somewhat
unprecedented instance of its subject matter, and thus somewhat modifies
both the meaning of language and the structure of our conceptual
framework.52 I implied this already, when I spoke of denotation as an
art (p. 81), and likened the lifelong process by which the meaning of
words is established to that by which we interpret and re-interpret our
sensory clues (pp. 98–100). These hints can now be consolidated and
developed, within a fuller analysis of the way in which the reiteration
of linguistic utterances with reference to identifiable occasions
carries with it a change of their meaning, each time we either listen to
speech or utter it ourselves.</p>
<p>The re-interpretation of language can take place at a number of
different levels. (1) The child learning to speak practises it
receptively. (2) Poets, scientists or scholars can propose linguistic
innovations, and teach others to use them. (3) Re-interpretation takes
place also at an intermediate level in the everyday use of language
which modifies it imperceptibly, without any conscious effort at
innovation.</p>
<p>I shall deal with all three of these cases in turn; but I must first
pick up yet another thread which may serve us as a guide here. Piaget
has described the subsumption of a new instance under a previously
accepted conception as a process of assimilation; while he describes as
adaptation the formation of new or modified conceptions for the purpose
of dealing with novel experience.53 I shall use these terms to describe
the two associated movements by which we both apply and re-shape our
conceptions at the same time; for I regard this combination as essential
to all conceptual decisions, even though one of the two characters may
predominate in any particular case.</p>
<p>The distinction between assimilation of experience by a fixed
interpretative framework and the adaptation of such a framework to
comprise the lessons of a new experience, gains a new and more precise
meaning when the framework in question is articulate. The first
represents the ideal of using language impersonally, according to strict
rules; the second relies on a personal intervention of the speaker, for
changing the rules of language to fit new occasions. The first is a
routine performance, the second a heuristic act. A paradigm of the first
is counting, which leaves its interpretative framework—the numbers used
in counting—quite unchanged; the ideal of the second is found in the
originality of poetic phrasing or of new mathematical notations covering
new conceptions. Ideally, the first is strictly reversible, while the
second is essentially irreversible. For to modify our idiom is to modify
the frame of reference within which we shall henceforth interpret our
experience; it is to modify ourselves. In contrast to a formal procedure
which we can recapitulate at will and trace back to its premises, it
entails a conversion to new premises not accessible by any strict
argument from those previously held. It is a decision, originating in
our own personal judgment, to modify the premises of our judgment, and
thus to modify our intellectual existence, so as to become more
satisfying to ourselves.</p>
<p>But again, this urge to satisfy ourselves is not purely egocentric.
Our craving for greater clarity and coherence, both in our speech and in
the experience of which we speak, seeks a solution to a problem, a
solution on which we may henceforth rely. It tries to discover something
and to establish it firmly. We seek self-satisfaction here only as a
token of what should be universally satisfying. The modification of our
intellectual identity is entered upon in the hope of achieving thereby
closer contact with reality. We take a plunge only in order to gain a
firmer foothold. The intimations of this prospective contact are
conjectural and may prove false, but they are not therefore mere guesses
like betting on a throw of dice. For the capacity for making discoveries
is not a kind of gambler’s luck. It depends on natural ability, fostered
by training and guided by intellectual effort. It is akin to artistic
achievement and like it is unspecifiable, but far from accidental or
arbitrary.</p>
<p>This is the sense in which I called denotation an art. To learn a
language or to modify its meaning is a tacit, irreversible, heuristic
feat; it is a transformation of our intellectual life, originating in
our own desire for greater clarity and coherence, and yet sustained by
the hope of coming by it into closer touch with reality. Indeed, any
modification of an anticipatory framework, whether conceptual,
perceptual or appetitive, is an irreversible heuristic act, which
transforms our ways of thinking, seeing and appreciating in the hope of
attuning our understanding, perception or sensuality more closely to
what is true and right. Though each of these non-linguistic adaptations
will affect our language, I shall continue to deal here only with the
interaction between modifications of the conceptual and linguistic
frameworks, to which I referred at the opening of this section.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first of the three levels on which I have proposed to illustrate
the re-interpretation of language is that of the child learning to
speak. Its early guesswork may appear floundering and foolish to adults,
but the conjectural character of linguistic usage which it reveals is
necessarily inherent in all speech and remains inherent in ours to the
end. A child will point at the washing fluttering in the wind and call
it ‘weather’, and call the pegs fastening the washing ‘small weather’,
and the windmill ‘big weather’. Such infantile false generalizations in
guessing the meaning of words are known as ‘childish verbalism’,54 but
the mistakes persisting in adult life are quite similar. Few people seem
to know, for example, that the common adjective ‘arch’ means ‘cunning’
or ‘playfully roguish’. Even exceptionally well educated persons may
tell you that it means ‘oily’, ‘ingratiating’, ‘ironical’, or
‘pretending to be aristocratic’. For some years past the Readers Digest
has published every week a different list of ten words known to most
people, asking the reader to identify, out of three classes mentioned,
that to which the notion designated by each word belongs; and rarely
does anyone get the whole list right. We have a comparatively safe
knowledge of the most frequently used words, but this assured vocabulary
is surrounded by a swarm of half-understood expressions which we hardly
ever venture to use at all. This hesitation reflects a sense of
intellectual uneasiness, which induces us to grope for greater clarity
and coherence.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have already expressed my belief that we must credit ourselves with
the capacity for appraising the inadequacy of our own articulation
(p. 91). I shall now claim this capacity myself for saying that verbal
mistakes go hand in hand with misunderstandings of the subject matter by
which we feel puzzled. A child who uses the same word ‘weather’ for
rain, clothespegs and windmills, has an unsatisfying and hence unstable
conception of weather in which all these disparate things are
amalgamated. I can still remember a puzzling conception I had as a
child, in which buns and luggage were fused together, in view of the
fact that I could not distinguish between the German words ‘Gebäck’ and
‘Gepäck’, which applied to the two respectively. Dylan Thomas tells how
he fused in childhood the two meanings of ‘front’, designating the
entrance to the house and the battlefields in France,55 and wondered at
the curious consequences flowing from this hybridization. Rarer words
like ‘epicene’ or ‘cynosure’ evoke in most of us confused and uncertain
conceptions combining disjointed clues, borrowed mostly from the meaning
of similarly sounding words. Scholars continue to conjecture on
precisely what conceptions are covered by such Greek terms as ‘arete’
and ‘sophrosyne’; their guesses are guided by criteria of fitness
similar to those on which the child relies in its fumblings to
understand speech.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Confusion may prevail for a long time also in some branch of the
natural sciences, and be finally resolved only in conjunction with a
clarification of terms. The atomic theory of chemistry was established
by John Dalton in 1808 and generally accepted almost at once. Yet for
about fifty years, in which the theory was universally applied, its
meaning remained obscure. It came as a revelation to scientists when in
1858 Cannizaro distinguished precisely the three closely related
conceptions of atomic weight; molecular weight and equivalent weight
(weight per valence), which had been used until then in an
indeterminately interchangeable manner. The appositeness of Cannizaro’s
interpretative framework brought new clarity and coherence into our
understanding of chemistry. Such clarification is irreversible; it is as
difficult tc reconstruct today the confused conceptions which chemists
used during the previous half century (and which for example induced
Dalton to reject Avogadro’s Law as contrary to the atomic theory of
chemistry), as it is to be baffled once more by a puzzle after having
discovered its solution. Remember also how, during almost a century
after the first appearance of Mesmer, men of science felt that they had
either to accept the false claims of ‘animal magnetism’, or reject all
the evidence in its favour as illusory or fraudulent, until at last
Braid resolved the false dilemma by suggesting the new conception of
‘hypnotism’.56 Great pioneers of hypnotism, like Elliotson, had fallen
tragic victims to the confusion previously prevailing, for lack of a
conceptual framework in which their discoveries could be separated from
specious and untenable admixtures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cannizaro and Braid made conceptual discoveries, which they
consolidated by an improvement of language; their better understanding
of their subject matter enabled them to speak about it more appositely.
Such linguistic innovation is linked to the shaping of new conceptions
in the same way as the learning of an established language is linked to
the acquiring of current conceptions of its subject matter. As in the
case of childish verbalism, the confusions of which we have seen
examples in the natural sciences consist in a deficiency of intellectual
control, which causes uneasiness, and is remediable by conceptual and
linguistic reform.</p>
<p>I must digress here briefly to consider more closely the process by
which confusion is eliminated in these different cases and others
related to them. The falling apart of text and meaning, whether in the
child or in the scientist, is the sign of a problematic state of mind.
The seat of such confusion is always conceptual. There is independent
evidence from the study of animals that confusion can arise on the
purely inarticulate level.57 Human confusion may be verbal, in the sense
that it could not be produced without the use of language: a man
speculating on the possibility of predicting his own actions is puzzled
in a way no chimpanzee can be. Yet his perplexity is similar to that in
which he would be involved by speculating on the possibility of lifting
himself by his own shoe-laces; though this perplexity could be
experienced inarticulately by a child or a chimpanzee trying to lift
itself up in this manner.</p>
<p>When a child confuses homonyms or fuses the meanings of
similarsounding words, or when it is perplexed by verbally formulated
problems the answer to which it has long known how to find in practice,
its use of language is obscuring what had previously been clear to its
tacit understanding. Such childish sophistication can be cured by
teaching children to understand and use speech in accordance with their
anterior inarticulate understanding of the subject-matter. Modern
analytic philosophy has demonstrated that this may hold also in
philosophy. Philosophic problems may sometimes be dissolved by defining
the meaning of their terms in accordance with our unsophisticated
understanding of their subject matter.</p>
<p>But purely speculative problems are not always so fruitless.
Speculations about lifting oneself by one’s own shoelaces, for example,
coincide essentially with speculations on mechanical devices of
perpetual motion, which were resolved only by the discovery of
mechanics, to which they effectively contributed. The paradox raised by
Einstein as a schoolboy about the behaviour of light in a laboratory
moving with the speed of light, was resolved only by Einstein’s reform
of the concept of simultaneity, and his conjoint establishment of
special relativity. The fundamental part played by various logical and
semantic paradoxes in stimulating the recent conceptual development in
logic is equally notorious. I believe that the solution of philosophic
puzzles, like that raised by the question whether we can predict our own
actions, may also lead to important conceptual discoveries.58 In fact,
my present book rests on precisely these grounds; I am attempting to
resolve by conceptual reform the apparent self-contradiction entailed in
believing what I might conceivably doubt.</p>
<p>I have suggested before (p. 95) that when text and meaning fall apart
we must choose whether to</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><ol type="a">
<li>Correct the meaning of the text.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Re-interpret the text.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Re-interpret experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Dismiss the text as meaningless.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Case (1a) is now seen to cover both the receptive process by which we
improve our knowledge of a language, and the elimination of verbal
puzzles by a stricter control of language, as practised by modern
philosophy. Combinations of (1b) and (2) are exemplified by conceptual
discoveries in science; analogous discoveries, not referring to
experience, are possible in mathematics, to which I shall yet return.
The dismissal of a text as meaningless, and of the problem raised by it
as a pseudoproblem (Case (3)), may result from the philosophic
clarification of its terms (Case (1a)).</p>
<p>Every one of these choices involves the shaping of meaning in the
light of our standards of clarity and reason. Such a choice constitutes
a heuristic act which may display the highest degree of originality.
This I have illustrated just now by recalling the examples of Cannizaro
and Braid. But I want also to mention again the case of Ernst Mach, who
denounced as meaningless Newton’s ‘absolute space’: a conception which
the discovery of relativity later proved to be not meaningless but
false.59 For this error recalls others of its kind. When Poincaré said
that a proportionate change in the linear dimensions of all solid bodies
would be unobservable, and therefore empty of meaning,60 he overlooked a
host of consequences arising from the corresponding change in the
relation of volumes and sizes. For a time it was thought that the
Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction was essentially unobservable,61 which is
false. The paradox of the Liar was long regarded as a mere sophism,
without importance in logic,62 in which it was later recognized as a
fundamental problem. The interpretative act by which a question is
dismissed as a pseudoproblem is inevitably fraught with all the risks of
a heuristic decision.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Language is continuously re-interpreted in its everyday use without
the sharp spur of any acute problem, and some kindred questions of
nomenclature are usually settled in a similarly smooth fashion in
science. The general principle which governs these occasions has already
been stated; I shall re-assert it now as follows. In this changing
world, our anticipatory powers have always to deal with a somewhat
unprecedented situation, and they can do so in general only by
undergoing some measure of adaptation. More particularly: since every
occasion on which a word is used is in some degree different from every
previous occasion, we should expect that the meaning of a word will be
modified in some degree on every such occasion. For example, since no
owl is exactly like any other, to say ‘This is an owl’, a statement
which ostensibly says something about the bird in front of us, also says
something new about the term ‘owl’, that is, about owls in general.</li>
</ol>
<p>This raises an awkward question. Can we safely sanction the practice
of adapting the meaning of words so that what we say shall be true? If
we can say of an unprecedented owl, belonging perhaps to a new species:
‘This is an owl’, using this designation in an appropriately modified
sense, why should we not equally well say of an owl: ‘This is a
sparrow’, meaning a new kind of sparrow, not known so far by that name?
Indeed, why should we ever say one thing rather than another, and not
pick our descriptive terms at random? Or alternatively, if our terms are
to be defined by conformity to their present applications, would any
statement say more than ‘this is this’, which is clearly useless?</p>
<p>I shall try to answer this by an illustration from the exact
sciences. When heavy hydrogen (deuterium) was discovered by Urey in
1932, it was described by him as a new isotope of hydrogen. At a
discussion held by the Royal Society in 1934 the discoverer of isotopy,
Frederic Soddy, objected to this on the grounds that he had originally
defined the isotopes of an element as chemically inseparable from each
other, and heavy hydrogen was chemically separable from light
hydrogen.63 No attention was paid to this protest and a new meaning of
the term ‘isotope’ was tacitly accepted instead. The new meaning allowed
heavy hydrogen to be included among the isotopes of hydrogen, in spite
of its unprecedented property of being chemically separable from its
fellow isotopes. Thus the statement ‘There exists an element deuterium
which is an isotope of hydrogen’ was accepted in a sense which
re-defined the term isotope, so that this statement, which otherwise
would be false, became true. The new conception abandoned a previously
accepted criterion of isotopy as superficial, and relied instead only on
the identity of nuclear charges in isotopes.</p>
<p>Our identification of deuterium as an isotope of hydrogen thus
affirms two things: (1) that there exists in the case of hydrogen and
deuterium an instance of a new kind of chemical separability, pertaining
to two elements of equal nuclear charge, (2) that these elements are to
be regarded as isotopes in spite of their separability, merely on the
grounds of their equal nuclear change. The new observations referred to
in (1) necessitated the conceptual and linguistic reforms decreed in
(2). They rendered the linguistic rule ‘all “isotopes” are chemically
inseparable’ untenable, and compelled its replacement by a new usage
reflecting the truer conception of isotopy derived from these
observations. For to retain the original conception of isotopy, by which
the chemical differences between light and heavy hydrogen would be
classed with the chemical differences between two elements filling
different places of the periodic system, would have been misleading to
the point of absurdity. This demonstrates the principle which must guide
us when adapting the meaning of words, so that what we say shall be
true: the corresponding conceptual decisions must be right—their implied
allegations true.</p>
<p>Thus we call a new kind of owl an owl, rather than a sparrow, because
the modification of the conception of owls by which we include the bird
in question as an instance of ‘owls’ makes sense; while a modification
of our conception of sparrows, by which we would include this bird as an
instance of ‘sparrows’, makes nonsense. The former conceptual decision
is right and its implications true, in the same sense in which the
decision to accept deuterium and hydrogen as isotopes in a modified
sense of this term, is right and its implications true. Similarly, in
both cases—of owls and of isotopes—the alternative decisions are wrong
and their implications untrue. There is only this difference between the
two cases: that the adaptation of the isotope concept to accommodate the
observations on deuterium and hydrogen can be specified in terms of an
amendment to the definition of isotopy, while the adaptations of a
morphological concept like that of ‘owl’, by which it is made to include
novel specimens, can usually not be so specified. I shall expand these
observations in Part Four within a wider context.</p>
<p>The adaptation of our conceptions and of the corresponding use of
language to new things that we identify as new variants of known kinds
of things is achieved subsidiarily, while our attention is focussed on
making sense of a situation in front of us. Thus we do this in the same
way in which we keep modifying, subsidiarily, our interpretation of
sensory clues by striving for clear and coherent perceptions, or
enlarging our skill without focally knowing how by practising them in
ever new situations. The meaning of speech thus keeps changing in the
act of groping for words without our being focally aware of the change,
and our gropings invest words in this manner with a fund of
unspecifiable connotations. Languages are the product of man’s groping
for words in the process of making new conceptual decisions, to be
conveyed by words.64</p>
<p>Different languages are alternative conclusions, arrived at by the
secular gropings of different groups of people at different periods of
history. They sustain alternative conceptual frameworks, interpreting
all things that can be talked about in terms of somewhat different
allegedly recurrent features. The confident use of the nouns, verbs,
adjectives and adverbs, invented and endowed with meaning by a
particular sequence of groping generations, expresses their particular
theory of the nature of things.65 In learning to speak, every child
accepts a culture constructed on the premises of the traditional
interpretation of the universe, rooted in the idiom of the group to
which it was born, and every intellectual effort of the educated mind
will be made within this frame of reference. Man’s whole intellectual
life would be thrown away should this interpretative framework be wholly
false; he is rational only to the extent to which the conceptions to
which he is committed are true. The use of the word ‘true’ in the
preceding sentence is part of a process of re-defining the meaning of
truth, so as to make it truer in its own modified sense.</p>
<p>Different vocabularies for the interpretation of things divide men
into groups which cannot understand each other’s way of seeing things
and of acting upon them. For different idioms determine different
patterns of possible emotions and actions. If, and only if, we believe
in witches may we burn people as witches; if, and only if, we believe in
God will we build churches; if we believe in master races we may
exterminate Jews and Poles; if in class war, we may join the Communist
Party; if in guilt, we may feel remorse and punish offenders; if in
guilt-complexes, we may apply psychoanalysis instead; and so on.</p>
<p>Modern writers have rebelled against the power exercised by words
over our thoughts, and have expressed this by deprecating words as mere
conventions, established for the sake of convenient communication. This
is just as misleading as to say that the theory of relativity is chosen
for convenience. We may properly ascribe convenience only to a minor
advantage in the pursuit of a major purpose. It is nonsense, for
example, to compare the convenience of interpreting sudden death in the
idiom of witchcraft with the convenience of using instead a medical
terminology, or to compare the convenience of describing political
opponents as such, with that of calling them spies, monsters, enemies of
the people, etc. Our choice of language is a matter of truth or error,
of right or wrong—of life or death.</p>
<p>The understatement that language is a set of convenient symbols used
according to the conventional rules of a ‘language game’ originates in
the tradition of nominalism, which teaches that general terms are merely
names designating certain collections of objects—a doctrine which, in
spite of the difficulties admittedly attached to it, is accepted today
by most writers in England and America, in abhorrence of its
metaphysical alternatives. The question how the same term can apply to a
series of indeterminately variable particulars is avoided by admitting
that terms have an ‘open texture’.66 ‘Open’ terms, however, lack any
definite meaning; they may mean anything, unless some intervention is
admitted which is competent to control the range of their meaning. My
own view admits this controlling principle by accrediting the speaker’s
sense of fitness for judging that his words express the reality he seeks
to express. Without this, words having an open texture are totally
meaningless, and any text written in such words is meaningless. Refusing
to make this admission, the nominalist has either to refrain from
enquiring how such words can be applied, except arbitrarily, to
experience; or else to invoke a set of vague regulative
principles—without asking on what authority these rules are to be
accepted and how they can be applied, unless arbitrarily, in view of
their own vagueness.67 All these deficiencies are overlooked in an
overriding desire to avoid reference to metaphysical notions or at least
to cover these up under a cloak of nominalist respectability.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the study of linguistic rules is used as a
pseudosubstitute for the study of the things referred to in its terms.
For example, Wittgenstein says, ‘“I don’t know whether I am in pain or
not” is not a significant proposition.68 But the experience of
pediatricians shows that children are often in doubt whether they are in
pain or are uncomfortable for other reasons. Thus the pseudo-character
of the substitution becomes apparent here because the implied statement
is mistaken. Had Wittgenstein said. ‘It is in the nature of pain that I
can always tell whether I feel it or not’ he would have been mistaken in
fact. By using the pseudo-substitute: Tt is contrary to accepted usage
to speak of pain whether I feel it or not’, he said something true which
was irrelevant to the nature of pain, about which he was actually
mistaken.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, disagreements on the nature of things cannot be
expressed as disagreements about the existing use of words. Whether an
alleged machine of perpetual motion is such a machine or not cannot be
decided by studying the use of the terms in question. Whether the law is
but ‘the will of the stronger’ or ‘the command of the sovereign’ or . .
. etc., cannot be decided by linguistic investigations, which are
irrelevant to the issue. These controversial questions can be attended
to only if we use language as it exists to direct our attention to its
subject matter and not the other way around, selecting instances of
relevant cases to direct our attention to our use of language. ‘Grammar’
is precisely the total of linguistic rules which can be observed by
using a language without attending to the things referred to. The
purpose of the philosophic pretence of being merely concerned with
grammar is to contemplate and analyse reality, while denying the act of
doing so.69</p>
<p>There are of course ‘Scheinprobleme’, and none of these could have
arisen without the use of language. Newton could not have formulated his
axioms on time and space without talking about absolute rest. But the
conception of absolute rest was not suggested by any abuse of language,
nor could it be eliminated by reference to ordinary experience and
everyday usage, for it was actually rooted in these. Nor were Mach’s
speculations unavailing for being misguided by Newton’s conceptual
error; for they raised a problem which led to a great discovery.</p>
<p>I suggest that we should be more frank in facing our situation and
acknowledge our own faculties for recognizing real entities, the
designations of which form a rational vocabulary. I believe that a
classification made according to rational criteria should form groups of
things which we may expect to have an indefinite number of properties in
common, and that accordingly the terms designating such classes will
have an intension referring to an indefinite range of uncovenanted
common properties shared by the members of a class. The ampler the
intensions of a key feature, the more rational should be as a rule the
identification of things in its terms and the more truly should such
classification reveal the nature of the classified objects; while
classifications made according to terms having no intension should be
rejected as purely artificial, unreal, nonsensical; unless indeed they
are designed purely for convenience as, e.g., an alphabetic register of
words.</p>
<p>This belief in our capacity for conceiving objective classifications
may be acknowledged here on the ground of its continuity with my
previous endorsement of personal knowledge and of the personal
coefficient of articulation in a great variety of aspects—even though
the kind of personally grounded objectivity which it entails must still
remain unelucidated at this stage. I shall go on therefore to elaborate
this belief further.</p>
<p>There are three successively deeper strata of intensions, of which
the first comprises the readily specifiable properties which a class of
things are known to share apart from their common key-feature; such
manifest intension forms the patent evidence for the reality of the
classification. The second stratum comprises the known but not readily
specifiable properties which these things share. The range of such
properties subsumed under a term is the measure to which its analysis
may lead to a deeper understanding of the things it designates. Words of
great human significance accumulate through the centuries an
unfathomable fund of subsidiarily known connotations, which we can bring
partly into focus by reflecting on the use of such words—in the same way
as we may recognize the characteristic elements of a physiognomy, or the
tricks conducive to a skill—by a process of analytic reflection. Hence
the fruitfulness of a Socratic enquiry into the meaning of words like
‘justice’ or ‘truth’ or ‘courage’, etc.</p>
<p>Understood in these terms, definition is a formalization of meaning
which reduces its informal elements and partly replaces them by a formal
operation (the reference to the definiens). This formalization will be
incomplete also in the sense that the definiens can be understood only
by those conversant with the definiendum. Even so, the definition may
still throw new light on the definiendum, in the way a guiding maxim
illuminates the practice of an art, though its application must rely on
the practical knowledge of the art. Such definitions (like ‘causation is
necessary succession’, ‘life is continuous adaptation’) are, if true and
new, analytic discoveries. Such discoveries are among the most important
tasks of philosophy.</p>
<p>To take cognizance focally of a subsidiary element of a comprehension
is a new experience, and an act which is usually hazardous. The
conclusion thus reached is in the nature of an explanation. We see
combined here the characteristics of an empirical observation with those
of an analytic proposition. This is due ultimately to the fact that the
dichotomy between analytic propositions that are necessary, and
synthetic statements that are contingent, no longer holds when we can
know the same thing in two different ways which cannot be transposed
into each other by logical operations, but can be identified only by an
enquiry of the Socratic type.</p>
<p>Such an enquiry must be guided by the fact that to speak of
‘justice’, ‘truth’, ‘courage’, etc., is but a performance based on our
understanding of the subject matter of these terms. Only if we are
confident that we can identify what is just, true or courageous, can we
reasonably undertake to analyse our own practice of applying the terms
‘justice’, ‘truth’ or ‘courage’, and hope that such an analysis will
reveal to us more clearly what is just, true or courageous.</p>
<p>It is the same as if we studied the motions involved in using a
hammer effectively with a view to improving our hammering. For this we
must wield a hammer as efficiently as we can, even while watching our
motions to discover the best way of hammering. Similarly, we must use
the word ‘justice’, and use it as correctly and thoughtfully as we can,
while watching ourselves doing it, if we want to analyse the conditions
under which the word properly applies. We must look, intently and
discriminatingly, through the term ‘justice’ at justice itself, this
being the proper use of the term ‘justice’, the use which we want to
define. To look instead at the word ‘justice’ would only destroy its
meaning. Besides, to study the recurrence of the word ‘justice’ as a
mere noise in its repeated occurrence in appropriate situations is
impossible, for only the meaningful use of the term can indicate to us
what situations we are to look at.</p>
<p>Speaking more generally: in order to analyse the use of a descriptive
term we must use it for the purpose of contemplating its subject matter,
and an analysis of this contemplation will inevitably extend to the
contemplated object. It will thus amount to an analysis of the
conception by which we are jointly aware both of the term and the
subject matter, or more precisely, to an analysis of the particulars
covered by this conception: from which we may derive both a more
rational use of the term and a better understanding of the things which
it designates.</p>
<p>The third and deepest level of intensions is formed by the
indeterminate range of anticipations expressed by designating something.
When we believe that we have truly designated something real, we expect
that it may yet manifest its effectiveness in an indefinite and perhaps
wholly unexpected manner. This intension comprises a range of properties
which only future discoveries may reveal—confirming thereby the
rightness of the conception conveyed by our term.70</p>
<p>I have already affirmed that these indeterminate anticipatory powers
of an apposite vocabulary are due to its contacts with reality. We may
extend the conception of reality implied here to account also for the
capacity of formal speculations to raise new problems and lead on to new
discoveries. A new mathematical conception may be said to have reality
if its assumption leads to a wide range of new interesting ideas.
Geometries based on alternatives to Euclid’s postulate of parallels were
explored by Saccheri a century before Lobatschevski, but he failed to
realize that they could be true. It was only the range of interesting
ideas developed by Lobatschevski and Bolyai from non-Euclidean
assumptions that eventually convinced a reluctant public. They had then
to admit that such conceptions had the same degree of reality as had
hitherto been ascribed to Euclid’s system. We may extend this conception
of reality to the arts, by recalling for example E. M. Forster’s
distinction between ‘flat’ and ‘round’ personages in a novel. A
character is called flat if its actions are almost wholly predictable,
while we say that a character is round if it can ‘convincingly surprise’
the reader. The fruitfulness of a new mathematical conception betokens
its superior reality; and so, in a novel, does the internal spontaneity
by which a ‘round’ personage may unexpectedly reveal new features which
nevertheless flow from its original character, and are therefore
convincing.</p>
<p>We come up here once more against the paradox of our selfreliance in
seeking contact with a reality of which we believe that it will yet
manifest itself in unexpected ways. This paradox we must carry forward
unrelieved until we find a balance to it within the framework of
commitment.</p>
