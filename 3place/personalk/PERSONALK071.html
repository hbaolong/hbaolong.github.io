<h4 id="precision">4. PRECISION</h4>
<p>I have also said before that we must accept the risks of semantic
indeterminacy, since only words of indeterminate meaning can have a
bearing on reality and that for meeting this hazard we must credit
ourselves with the ability to perceive such bearing.2 This decision
would eliminate precision of meaning as an ideal, and raise the question
in what sense (if any) we may apply the term ‘precise’ or ‘imprecise’ to
the meaning of a descriptive term.</p>
<p>I suggest that the term ‘precise’ is applicable to a descriptive word
in the same way as to a measured quantity, a map, or any other
description, in so far as the word appears to match experience.
Precision or imprecision is a property that can be predicated of a
designation when it is tested by matching it against something which is
not a designation, but is the situation on which the designation
bears.</p>
<p>This test itself cannot be tested in the same sense. It is a tacit
performance, and as such lacks the duality which makes the confrontation
and the matching of two things—the designation and the
designate—logically possible. Therefore, when we say of a descriptive
term that it is precise, we declare the result of a test which itself
cannot be said to be precise in the same sense. Of course, the
application of the term ‘precise’ might once more be said to be precise,
or imprecise, when we confront it with the test from which it was
derived; but this second confrontation would have to rely once more on a
personal appraisal which cannot be said to be precise in the sense in
which a description can be. The precision of a word will ultimately
always rely, therefore, on a test which is not precise in the same sense
as the word is said to be.</p>
<p>The indefinite and futile regress on which we enter when asking
whether the application of the term ‘precise’ is itself precise,
suggests that such a question should be avoided by denying to the word
‘precise’ the character of a descriptive term. When we say that a word
is precise (or apt, or fitting, or clear, or expressive), we approve of
an act of our own which we have found satisfying while carrying it out.
We are satisfied by something we do in the same way as when we make
sense of blurred sights or faint noises; or when we find our way or
recover our balance. We properly declare the outcome of this personal
comprehension of our own, by saying that a word which we are using is
precise. The indefinite regress arises only when we disguise this
announcement of our self-satisfaction as a descriptive term designating
a property of another descriptive term.</p>
<p>We shall avoid this fallacy by fully acknowledging that only a
speaker or listener can mean something by a word, and a word in itself
can mean nothing. When the act of meaning is thus brought home to a
person exercising his understanding of things by the use of words which
describe them, the possibility of performing the act of meaning
according to strict criteria appears logically meaningless. For any
strictly formal operation would be impersonal and could not therefore
convey the speaker’s personal commitment. The analysis of the term
‘precise’ applied to descriptive terms which can mean something real
only if they are not strictly precise, reveals therefore the
self-reliant act of the speaker uttering the term and assessing its
precision.</p>
