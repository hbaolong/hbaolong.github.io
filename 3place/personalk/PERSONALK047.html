<h4 id="mathematics">9. MATHEMATICS</h4>
<p>Natural science is an expansion of observing; technology, of
contriving; mathematics, of understanding. I have illustrated
inarticulate understanding in animals by the way they know their way
about a complex topography. Another illustration of it, taken from human
experience, was that of an engineer grasping how the parts of a machine
fit together and function jointly. A process of understanding is carried
out articulately by operations which transform a given set of formulae
into another set of formulae, implied in the first, or by a construction
which transforms a geometrical figure into another, determined by the
first. The result can be expressed either as a law, such as the laws of
number theory and the theorems of geometry, or as a rule of procedure,
such as we have for solving equations or for constructing geometrical
figures from given elements. In the first case mathematics appears as a
set of declaratory sentences resembling natural science, in the second
as a set of recipes resembling technology. But these declaratory
sentences record no observations concerning specific objects of nature,
and the recipes disclose no operational principles for achieving any
specific material advantage. Both the affirmations of mathematical
formulae and the recipes given in mathematical proofs deal with
conceptions which may have no specific bearing on experience. Valid
formulae acknowledge the identity of two alternative aspects of the same
conception, while proofs induce the identification of two such
alternatives. The first can be said to be true or false like the
statements of natural science; the second to be successful or
unsuccessful (right or wrong) like the operational principles of
technology. But both are merely articulate means of reorganizing the
conceptions of which they speak: one stating the result of the
reorganization, the other prescribing the procedure for achieving
it.</p>
<p>Accordingly, mathematics can be equally well affiliated either to
natural science or technology. Physics and mathematics coincide when
mechanics is transposed into a four-dimensional non-Euclidean geometry,
and when three-dimensional geometry is regarded as comprising the metric
relations of rigid solids. The conception of integers is part of physics
in so far as it affirms the existence of permanently discrete objects;
while on the other hand, mathematical operations can form part of
automatic technical processes and a strictly formalized technology may
be regarded as part of mathematics.67 Mathematical symbolism and
mathematical operations thus show themselves appropriate to the exercise
of intellectual control both over things and manipulations, but the
instances to which they apply are so varied as to leave extremely little
of any particular experience attached to the mathematical framework
controlling them. Even elementary mathematics denotes conceptions and
operations of great generality, and these conceptions are further
attenuated by mathematical inventiveness, which keeps extending the
conceptual framework of mathematics ever further beyond its original
contacts with experience.</p>
<p>This process is principally guided by two closely related cravings.
The first strives for ever greater generality. Descartes’ triumph in
discovering that the theorems of analytical geometry were but an
illustration of algebra elevated the human mind into a region where
numbers and diagrams were merged in a common harmonious understanding.
Since then mathematics has made innumerable further strides towards
generalization. Moreover, aspirations for greater generality frequently
entail demands for greater rigorousness—the second craving that guides
mathematical invention. Euclid had not hesitated to construct an
equilateral triangle by connecting the point at which two circles
intersect with the centres of the two circles. But once lines were
defined, by a generalization of arithmetic as point-sets, it seemed no
longer obvious that two circles crossing each other had a point of
intersection. Contrary to traditional common sense, curves could now be
conceived as discontinuous at every point. Modern set theory has thus
raised new critical scruples in geometry, and by satisfying these
scruples it has established more exacting standards of geometrical
proof.68</p>
<p>We have seen the importance of conceptual reforms in the natural
sciences, and they play their part also in technology. But in
mathematics they take on a new power: they create a universe of
discourse which is interesting in itself. This is (as I have said
before) like inventing a game by the creation of entirely new concepts,
the symbols of which denote nothing but that they are the proper
subjects for certain operations.</p>
<p>The imaginative acts by which mathematics creates the object of its
own discourse are acceptable only if something interesting can be said
about these objects that is not immediately apparent from their original
definition.69 I have said this before in extending the concept of
reality to mathematics and recalled there how Lobatschesvky’s assumption
that a multiplicity of parallels to one straight line can be drawn
through one point outside it, eventually carried conviction to
mathematicians because it could be shown to involve a whole system of
noteworthy implications. In algebra we have a striking instance of this
process in the imaginary roots of negative numbers, first defined as
such in the sixteenth century (Cardan, Bombelli), the justification of
which remained questionable until the discovery of their far-reaching
functions in the calculus of complex numbers (the sums of real and
imaginary numbers) by Gauss in the nineteenth century. Some further
examples will be mentioned later.</p>
<p>No sharp distinction can be drawn between mathematical theories which
apply to external objects, and mathematical inventions which are
interesting only in themselves, for there is always a possibility that a
mathematical theorem may prove applicable to experience some time. Yet
the fact that this is not necessarily true, and indeed appears very
unlikely for the far greater part of mathematics, is a distinctive
feature of this science.70 Not being primarily concerned with
foretelling what is going to happen, or with contriving what anyone
wished to happen, but merely with understanding exactly how alternative
aspects of a certain set of conceptions are logically connected,
mathematics can extend its subject matter indefinitely by conceiving new
problems of this sort, without any reference to experience. New
conceptions are thus consolidated, as their wider implications and more
extensive operability come into view, and this pursuit perpetuates
itself by throwing up ever new opportunities for further conceptual
innovations.</p>
<p>It now appears that the logical structure of this process is not
quite that of inventing a game, but rather that of the continued
invention of a game in the very course of playing the game. This kind of
game-inventing is akin to the writing of a novel, and the parallel is
indeed quite close up to a point. There never was a person called
Sherlock Holmes, nor even a person like Sherlock Holmes. Yet this
character was well defined by the description of his consistent
behaviour in a series of fictitious situations. Once Conan Doyle had
composed a few good stories with Sherlock Holmes as their hero, the
image of the detective—however absurd in itself—was clearly fixed for
the purposes of any further such stories. The main difference between a
fictitious mathematical entity, like a complex number, and a fantastic
character like Sherlock Holmes, lies in the greater hold which the
latter has on our imagination. It is due to the far richer sensuous
elements entering into the conception of Sherlock Holmes. That is why we
acquire an image and not merely a conception of the detective.</p>
