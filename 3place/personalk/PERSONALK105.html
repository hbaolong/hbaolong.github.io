<h4 id="explanations-of-equipotentiality">6. EXPLANATIONS OF
EQUIPOTENTIALITY</h4>
<p>Many contemporary scientists insist that all intelligent behaviour is
based on a machinery which, in organisms possessing a nervous system,
operates on the principles of digital computers. This is the
McCulloch-Pitts theory of neural network. It shows that a suitable
linkage of neural circuits can account for the responses given by an
intelligent person to the stimuli impinging on his sensory organs.
Adherents of this theory go so far as to assert that even the
discoveries of Kepler and Darwin are but the output of a computing
machine capable of solving a very great number of simultaneous
equations. To represent Kepler and Darwin (and presumably also
Shakespeare and Beethoven) as automata is, according to K. Z. Lorenz who
puts forward this view, imperative for ‘the inductive research worker
who does not believe in miracles’.18 I have dealt with this theory in
the previous section.</p>
<p>Others have criticized the digital computer model on the grounds that
it does not account for the great resilience of the nervous system under
the effects of widespread injuries. One would, indeed, hardly expect
such a delicate machinery so promptly to resume its functions—often in a
novel manner—when large parts of it are excised, its peripheral network
cut through at essential points, or some of its effector organs
amputated.19</p>
<p>A radical alternative to the digital computer as the operational
principle of the neural network has long been advanced by W. Kohler in
the form of his principle of ‘isomorphism’. Köhler points to certain
orderly physical systems which can be described in two alternative
terms: one referring directly to their comprehensive orderly features,
the other stating the dynamic conditions underlying this orderly state.
Thus Kepler’s laws describe directly certain comprehensive orderly
features of the solar system, which can be shown to be but a
manifestation of interactions based on Newtonian dynamics. The principle
of isomorphism assumes that the neural traces of stimuli interact
likewise in accordance with some dynamic laws of physics or chemistry,
thus giving rise to an orderly configuration inside the nervous system:
a configuration which has all the comprehensive features of the objects
from which the stimuli originated. The excitation of this orderly
condition within our central nervous system is supposed to make us aware
of all the relations entering into the gestalt of the objects
confronting us. Thus, for example, the cortical counterpart of a square
is supposed to have all the structural properties of a square and enable
us thereby to respond to any of these properties.20</p>
<p>From this principle it would follow that the whole of
mathematics—whether known or yet to be discovered—is latent in the
neural traces arising in a man’s brain when he looks at the axioms of
Principia Mathematica. and that the physico-chemical equilibration of
these traces should be capable of producing a cerebral counterpart (a
coded script) comprising this entire body of mathematics. However, if
per incredibile, any such equilibration existed, it could certainly not
be based on the physico-chemical interaction of neural traces.</p>
<p>Köhler’s theory is also logically defective in failing to account for
the external manifestations of thought. It does not tell us how the
duplication of an external gestalt inside the brain will produce any
overt responses corresponding to itself—and a moment’s reflection shows
that it is indeed just as difficult to account for the formation of an
appropriate response to a cerebral gestalt as for a similar response to
the original gestalt outside the body. In order to satisfy us in this
respect, isomorphism would have to be supplemented by an effector
mechanism, for which so far the only principle suggested is that of the
computer which we have seen to be inadequate. Köhler’s theory,
therefore, leaves the problem of intelligent behaviour where it stood
before.</p>
<p>But the idea of equilibration as an ordering principle has wider
implications, presenting a more general problem. The predominant school
of biologists regard the persistent achievement of the same typical form
from a variety of embryonic cell-combinations as a process of
equilibration. They assume that the physico-chemical interaction of
every part with every other part of the developing embryonic fragment
brings about each time the same overall configuration.</p>
<p>Though I have already shown that isomorphism is untenable as a theory
of conceptual understanding or of intelligent behaviour, I shall
nevertheless momentarily accept it for the sake of the following
argument as an explanation for our sensory awareness of gestalt. The
sensory shaping of gestalt is then on a par with morphogenesis, as an
ordering process in which the comprehensive physico-chemical
interactions of the parts are supposed to produce orderly entities. The
question is: whether any such equipotential processes, leading to
comprehensive achievements of rightness, can in fact ever be represented
in terms of physico-chemical equilibration.</p>
<p>My answer to this at this stage, is as follows. (1) Where science and
technology overlap, operational principles overlap with certain laws of
nature (see p. 331 above), and in the same sense a physiological
function may conceivably coincide with certain laws of physics and
chemistry. Yet both in the case of technology and physiology something
is being achieved which neither physics nor chemistry can define.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>The seeing of a pattern or a shape is such an achievement. A
process of physico-chemical equilibration is indifferent to the success
or failure of gestalt seeing and therefore cannot express the difference
between illusion and knowledge, or represent the effort made by the
subject to avoid error and achieve knowledge. Morphogenesis is the
formation of right shapes, a process which may succeed or fail. A
physical-chemical explanation would not account for these alternatives,
it would merely shift the problem back to the rightness of the
conditions from which the process started.</p></li>
<li><p>All questions raised by psychology and morphogenesis are rooted
in our interest in mental activities and embryonic development. Studies
of physical-chemical processes can never take the place of these
interests; they can belong to psychology or embryology only to the
extent to which they have a bearing on anterior interests arising within
these sciences. Physical and chemical knowledge can form part of biology
only in its bearing on previously established biological shapes and
functions: a complete physical and chemical topography of a frog would
tell us nothing about it as a frog, unless we knew it previously as a
frog. In this sense both psychology and morphogenesis would remain
unspecifiable in terms of physics and chemistry even if the mechanistic
assumptions, which I have admitted here for the sake of argument, were
fulfilled. I shall illustrate this in the next chapter in respect of
morphogenesis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the moment we establish the following lessons. Living beings
function according to two always interwoven principles, namely as
machines and by ‘regulation’. Machine-like functions operate ideally by
fixed structures; the ideal case of regulation is an equipotential
integration of all parts in a joint performance. Both kinds of
performances are defined by rules of rightness and these refer in either
case to a comprehensive biotic entity. But there is this difference.
Machine-like functions are ideally defined by precise operational
principles, while the rightness of a regulative achievement can be
expressed only in gestalt-like terms. One’s comprehension of a machine
is, accordingly, analytical, while one’s appraisal of regulation is a
purely skilful knowing, a connoisseurship. Yet both kinds of
performances have it in common that their rightness cannot be specified
in the more impersonal terms of physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>The suggestion made in the foregoing Section 5, that equipotential
processes are a primordial form of originality, will be taken up later
in the chapter dealing with Evolution.</p>
