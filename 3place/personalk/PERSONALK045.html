<h4 id="passions-private-and-public">7. PASSIONS, PRIVATE AND
PUBLIC</h4>
<p>I have described before the passionate preoccupation with a problem
which alone can elicit discovery, and the protracted struggles against
doubts of its significance and validity by which its announcement is
often followed. Such a struggle, in which the ardour of discovery is
transformed into a craving to convince, is clearly a process of
verification in which the act of making sure of one’s own claims is
coupled with the effort of getting them accepted by others.</p>
<p>Yet as we pursue scientific discoveries through their consecutive
publication on their way to the textbooks, which eventually assures
their reception as part of established knowledge by successive
generations of students, and through these by the general public, we
observe that the intellectual passions aroused by them appear gradually
toned down to a faint echo of their discoverer’s first excitement at the
moment of Illumination. A theory like that of relativity continues to
attract the interest of ever new students and laymen by intimations of
its beauty yet hidden to their understanding: a beauty which is
rediscovered every time a new mind apprehends the theory. And it is
still for the sake of this remote and inaccessible beauty, and not for
its few useful formulae (which could be memorized in a minute), that
relativity continues to be valued as an intellectual triumph and
accepted as a great truth. All true appreciation of science by the
public continues to depend on the appreciation of such beauty—even
though sensed only at second hand; it offers an indirect tribute to the
values that the multitude have been taught to entrust to a group of men
whose cultural guidance they have accepted. Though the torrent widening
towards the ocean no longer breaks new paths, the intellectual passions
which had urged on the discoverer still pulsate in the common valuation
of science.</p>
<p>A transition takes place here from a heuristic act to the routine
teaching and learning of its results, and eventually to the mere holding
of these as known and true, in the course of which the personal
participation of the knower is altogether transformed. The impulse which
in the original heuristic act was a violent irreversible self-conversion
of the investigator and may have been followed by an almost equally
tempestuous process of converting others, is first repeated as a milder
version of itself in the eventual acceptance of the discovery by the
public, and will thus assume finally a form in which all dynamic quality
is lost. Personal participation changes from an impetuous pouring out of
oneself into channels of untried assumptions, into a confident holding
of certain conclusions as part of one’s interpretative framework. The
driving power of originality is reduced to a static personal
polarization of knowledge; the intellectual effort which led to
discovery and guided its verification is transformed into the force of a
conviction which holds it to be true—in exactly the same way as the
effort of acquiring a skill is transformed into a sense of its mastery.
This kind of emotional cascade could be detected on parallel lines over
many different domains of knowledge which are originally shaped by
pioneers and subsequently held by their successors. But I shall postpone
this analysis of apprenticeship, and turn now to a comparison of the
affirmative functions of our bodily emotions with those of our
intellectual passions.</p>
<p>Not all emotions have a sufficiently pointed bearing on something
outside the person moved by them to imply an affirmation. Languor,
vivacity or restlessness, anxiety (as distinct from fear), drunken
hilarity are all pervasive changes of personality that imply no
affirmation on the part of the person affected by them about anything
outside himself. But we find the same pointed character that
intellectual passions invariably possess in the force of drives, the
lure of lust, the grip of fear. We have indeed acknowledged such drives
before as the most primitive manifestations of the active principle by
which we grasp knowledge and hold it.</p>
<p>Yes, hunger, sex and fear are the motives of quests pursued with
passion, and these quests seek to discover the means to satisfy their
motives by consummatory acts like eating, copulation or flight; and
hence it follows also that the gratification of appetites is a manner of
verification—the proof of the pudding which is in the eating. Yet we
must allow for the possibility of the pudding’s being poisoned, and not
consider that everything that an animal swallows is proper food for it.
While we shall hold that animals are competent to choose their food, we
shall not deem their choice infallible.</p>
<p>The parallel with intellectual passions is clear, and so is the
contrast to them. As the pursuit of our drives implies the supposition
that there exist objects which we have reason to desire or to fear, so
similarly, all passions animating and shaping discovery imply a belief
in the possibility of a knowledge of which these passions declare the
value; and again, in accrediting these passions with the power to
recognize the truth, we do not assume their infallibility—since no rule
of scientific procedure is certain of finding the truth and avoiding
error—but we accept their competence. Our intellectual passions,
however, differ essentially from the cravings and emotions which we
share with the animals. The satisfaction of these terminates the
situation which evoked them. Discovery likewise terminates the problem
from which it started, but it leaves behind knowledge, which gratifies a
passion similar to that which sustained the craving for discovery. Thus
intellectual passions perpetuate themselves by their fulfilment.</p>
<p>This distinctive quality of intellectual passions is largely due to
the fact that they are attached to an articulate framework. A scientist
seeks to discover a satisfying theory, and when he has found it, he can
enjoy its excellence permanently. The intellectual passion which
animates the student to grapple with the difficulties of mathematical
physics is gratified when he feels at last that he understands it, but
it is the resulting sense of mastery that gives him permanent
intellectual satisfaction. While the purely intellectual joy of the
animal who has contrived a trick already shows the same enduring
quality, the articulate powers of man can extend the range of such joys
to whole systems of cultural gratification.</p>
<p>This wider perspective brings us back to the fact that scientific
value must be justified as part of a human culture extending over the
arts, laws and religions of man, all contrived likewise by the use of
language. For this great articulate edifice of passionate thought has
been reared by the force of the passions to which its erection offered
creative scope, and its lasting fabric continues to foster and gratify
these same passions. Young men and women brought up in this culture
accept it by pouring their minds into its fabric, and so live the
emotions which it teaches them to feel. They transmit these emotions in
their turn to succeeding generations, on whose responding fervour the
edifice relies for its continued existence.</p>
<p>By contrast to the satisfaction of appetites, the enjoyment of
culture creates no scarcity in the objects of offering gratification,
but secures and ever widens their availability to others. Those who
obtain such goods increase their universal supply and teach others to
enjoy them by practising what they were taught. The pupil submits to
what he acquires and improves himself by its standards.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the social lore which satisfied our intellectual
passions is not merely desired as a source of gratification; it is
listened to as a voice which commands respect. Yielding to our
intellectual passions, we desire to become more satisfying to ourselves,
and accept an obligation to educate ourselves by the standards which our
passions have set to ourselves. In this sense these passions are public,
not private: they delight in cherishing something external to us, for
its own sake. Here is indeed the fundamental difference between
appetites and mental interests. We must admit that both are sustained by
passions and must ultimately rely on standards which we set to
ourselves. For even though intellectual standards are acquired by
education, while our appetitive tastes are predominantly innate, both
may deviate from current custom; and even when they conform to it, they
must both ultimately be accredited by ourselves. But while appetites are
guided by standards of private satisfaction, a passion for mental
excellence believes itself to be fulfilling universal obligations.</p>
<p>This distinction is vital to the existence of culture. If it is
repudiated, all cultural life becomes subordinated in principle to the
demand of our appetites and of the public authorities responsible for
the advancement of material welfare. I shall deal with this situation
further when defining the relation of pure science to technology.</p>
