<h4 id="relativity">3. RELATIVITY</h4>
<p>The story of relativity is a complicated one, owing to the currency
of a number of historical fictions. The chief of these can be found in
every textbook of physics. It tells you that relativity was conceived by
Einstein in 1905 in order to account for the negative result of the
Michelson-Morley experiment, carried out in Cleveland eighteen years
earlier, in 1887. Michelson and Morley are alleged to have found that
the speed of light measured by a terrestrial observer was the same in
whatever direction the signal was sent out. That was surprising, for one
would have expected that the observer would catch up to some extent with
signals sent out in the direction in which the earth was moving, so that
the speed would appear slower in this direction, while the observer
would move away from the signal sent out in the opposite direction, so
that the speed would then appear faster. The situation is easily
understood if we imagine the extreme case that we are moving in the
direction of the signal exactly at the speed of light. Light would
appear to remain in a fixed position, its speed being zero, while of
course at the same time a signal sent out in the opposite direction
would move away from us at twice the speed of light.</p>
<p>The experiment is supposed to have shown no trace of such an effect
due to terrestrial motion, and so—the textbook story goes on—Einstein
undertook to account for this by a new conception of space and time,
according to which we could expect invariably to observe the same value
for the speed of light, whether we are at rest or in motion. So
Newtonian space, which is ‘necessarily at rest without reference to any
external object’, and the corresponding distinction between bodies in
absolute motion and bodies at absolute rest, were abandoned and a
framework set up in which only the relative motion of bodies could be
expressed.</p>
<p>But the historical facts are different. Einstein had speculated
already as a schoolboy, at the age of sixteen, on the curious
consequences that would occur if an observer pursued and kept pace with
a light signal sent out by him. His autobiography reveals that he
discovered relativity</p>
<p>after ten years’ reflection . . . from a paradox upon which I had
already hit at the age of sixteen: If I pursue a beam of light with the
velocity c (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam
of light as a spatially oscillatory electromagnetic field at rest.
However, there seems to be no such thing, whether on the basis of
experience or according to Maxwell’s equations. From the very beginning
it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of
such an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same
laws as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest.6</p>
<p>There is no mention here of the Michelson-Morley experiment. Its
findings were, on the basis of pure speculation, rationally intuited by
Einstein before he had ever heard about it. To make sure of this, I
addressed an enquiry to the late Professor Einstein, who confirmed the
fact that ‘the Michelson-Morley experiment had a negligible effect on
the discovery of relativity’.7</p>
<p>Actually, Einstein’s original paper announcing the Special Theory of
Relativity (1905) gave little grounds for the current misconception
concerning the origins of his discovery. It opens with a long paragraph
referring to the anomalies in the electrodynamics of moving media,
mentioning in particular the lack of symmetry in its treatment, on the
one hand, of a wire with current flowing through it moving relative to a
magnet at rest, and on the other of a magnet moving relative to the same
electric current at rest. It then goes on to say that ’similar examples,
as well as the unsuccessful attempts to observe the relative motion of
the earth in respect to the medium of light lead to the conjecture that,
as in mechanics, so also in electrodynamics, absolute rest is not
observable. . . .’8 The usual textbook account of relativity as a
theoretical response to the Michelson-Morley experiment is an invention.
It is the product of a philosophical prejudice. When Einstein discovered
rationality in nature, unaided by any observation that had not been
available for at least fifty years before, our positivistic textbooks
promptly covered up the scandal by an appropriately embellished account
of his discovery.</p>
<p>There is an aspect of this story that is even more curious. For the
programme which Einstein carried out was largely prefigured by he very
positivist conception of science which his own achievement so flagrantly
refuted. It was formulated explicitly by Ernst Mach, who, as we have
seen, had first advanced the conception of science as a timetable or
telephone directory. He had extensively criticized Newton’s definition
of space and absolute rest on the grounds that it said nothing that
could be tested by experience. He condemned this as dogmatic, since it
went beyond experience, and as meaningless, since it pointed to nothing
that could conceivably be tested by experience.9 Mach urged that
Newtonian dynamics should be reformulated so as to avoid referring to
any movement of bodies except as the relative motion of bodies with
respect to each other, and Einstein acknowledged the ‘profound
influence’ which Mach’s book exercised on him as a boy and subsequently
on his discovery of relativity.10 Yet if Mach had been right in saying
that Newton’s conception of space as absolute rest was
meaningless—because it said nothing that could be proven true or
false—then Einstein’s rejection of Newtonian space could have made no
difference to what we hold to be true or false. It could not have led to
the discovery of any new facts. Actually, Mach was quite wrong: he
forgot about the propagation of light and did not realize that in this
connection Newton’s conception of space was far from untestable.
Einstein, who realized this, showed that the Newtonian conception of
space was not meaningless but false.</p>
<p>Mach’s great merit lay in possessing an intimation of a mechanical
universe in which Newton’s assumption of a single point at absolute rest
was eliminated. His was a super-Copernican vision, totally at variance
with our habitual experience. For every object we perceive is set off by
us instinctively against a background which is taken to be at rest. To
set aside this urge of our senses, which Newton had embodied in his
axiom of an ‘absolute space’ said to be ‘inscrutable and immovable’, was
a tremendous step towards a theory grounded in reason and transcending
the senses. Its power lay precisely in that appeal to rationality which
Mach wished to eliminate from the foundations of science. No wonder
therefore that he advanced it on false grounds, attacking Newton for
making an empty statement and overlooking the fact that—far from being
empty—the statement was false. Thus Mach prefigured the great theoretic
vision of Einstein, sensing its inherent rationality, even while trying
to exorcise the very capacity of the human mind by which he gained this
insight.</p>
<p>But there yet remains an almost ludicrous part of the story to be
told. The Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887, which Einstein mentions
in support of his theory and which the textbooks have since falsely
enshrined as the crucial evidence which compelled him to formulate it,
actually did not give the result required by relativity! It admittedly
substantiated its authors’ claim that the relative motion of the earth
and the ‘ether’ did not exceed a quarter of the earth’s orbital
velocity. But the actually observed effect was not negligible; or has,
at any rate, not been proved negligible up to this day. The presence of
a positive effect in the observations of Michel-son and Morley was
pointed out first by W. M. Hicks in 190211 and was later evaluated by D.
C. Miller as corresponding to an ‘ether-drift’ of eight to nine
kilometres per second. Moreover, an effect of the same magnitude was
reproduced by D. C. Miller and his collaborators in a long series of
experiments extending from 1902 to 1926, in which they repeated the
Michelson-Morley experiment with new, more accurate apparatus, many
thousands of times.</p>
<p>The layman, taught to revere scientists for their absolute respect
for the observed facts, and for the judiciously detached and purely
provisional manner in which they hold scientific theories (always ready
to abandon a theory at the sight of any contradictory evidence), might
well have thought that, at Miller’s announcement of this overwhelming
evidence of a ‘positive effect’ in his presidential address to the
American Physical Society on December 29th, 1925, his audience would
have instantly abandoned the theory of relativity. Or, at the very
least, that scientists—wont to look down from the pinnacle of their
intellectual humility upon the rest of dogmatic mankind—might suspend
judgment in this matter until Miller’s results could be accounted for
without impairing the theory of relativity. But no: by that time they
had so well closed their minds to any suggestion which threatened the
new rationality achieved by Einstein’s world-picture, that it was almost
impossible for them to think again in different terms. Little attention
was paid to the experiments, the evidence being set aside in the hope
that it would one day turn out to be wrong.12</p>
<p>The experience of D. C. Miller demonstrates quite plainly the
hollow-ness of the assertion that science is simply based on experiments
which anybody can repeat at will. It shows that any critical
verification of a scientific statement requires the same powers for
recognizing rationality in nature as does the process of scientific
discovery, even though it exercises these at a lower level. When
philosophers analyse the verification of scientific laws, they
invariably choose as specimens such laws as are not in doubt, and thus
inevitably overlook the intervention of these powers. They are
describing the practical demonstration of scientific law, and not its
critical verification. As a result we are given an account of the
scientific method which, having left out the process of discovery on the
grounds that it follows no definite method.13 overlooks the process of
verification as well, by referring only to examples where no real
verification takes place.</p>
<p>At the time that Miller announced his results, relativity had yet
made few predictions that could be confirmed by experiment. Its
empirical support lay mainly in a number of already known observations.
The account which the new theory gave of these known phenomena was
considered rational, since it derived them from one single convincingly
rational principle. It was the same as when Newton’s comprehensive
account of Kepler’s Three Laws, of the moon’s period and of terrestrial
gravitation—in terms of a general theory of universal gravitation—was
immediately given a position of surpassing authority, even before any
predictions had been deduced from it. It was this inherent rational
excellence of relativity which moved Max Born, despite the strong
empirical emphasis of his accounts of science, to salute as early as
1920 ‘the grandeur, the boldness, and the directness of the thought’ of
relativity, which made the world-picture of science ‘more beautiful and
grander’.14</p>
<p>Since then, the passing years have brought wide and precise
confirmation of at least one formula of relativity; probably the only
formula ever sent sprawling across the cover of Time magazine. The
reduction of mass (m) by the loss of energy (e) accompanying nuclear
transformation has been repeatedly shown to confirm the relation e ==
c2, where c is the velocity of light. But such verifications of
relativity are but confirmations of the original judgment of Einstein
and his followers, who committed themselves to the theory long before
these verifications. And they are an even more remarkable justification
of the earlier strivings of Ernst Mach for a more rational foundation of
mechanics, setting out a programme for relativity at a time when no
avenues could yet be seen towards this objective.</p>
<p>The beauty and power inherent in the rationality of contemporary
physics is, as I have said, of a novel kind. When classical physics
superseded the Pythagorean tradition, mathematical theory was reduced to
a mere instrument for computing the mechanical motions which were
supposed to underlie all natural phenomena. Geometry also stood outside
nature, claiming to offer an a priori analysis of Euclidean space, which
was regarded as the scene of all natural phenomena but not thought to be
involved in them. Relativity, and subsequently quantum mechanics and
modern physics generally, have moved back towards a mathematical
conception of reality. Essential features of the theory of relativity
were anticipated as mathematical problems by Riemann in his development
of non-Euclidean geometry; while its further elaboration relied on the
powers of the hitherto purely speculative tensor calculus, which by a
fortunate accident Einstein got to know from a mathematician in Z¨rich.
Similarly, Max Born happened to find the matrix calculus ready to hand
for the development of Heisenberg’s quantum mechanics, which could
otherwise never have reached concrete conclusions. These examples could
be multiplied. By them, modern physics has demonstrated the power of the
human mind to discover and exhibit a rationality which governs nature,
before ever approaching the field of experience in which previously
discovered mathematical harmonies were to be revealed as empirical
facts.</p>
<p>Thus relativity has restored, up to a point, the blend of geometry
and physics which Pythagorean thought had first naively taken for
granted. We now realize that Euclidean geometry, which until the advent
of general relativity was taken to represent experience correctly,
referred only to comparatively superficial aspects of physical reality.
It gave an idealization of the metric relations of rigid bodies and
elaborated these exhaustively, while ignoring entirely the masses of the
bodies and the forces acting on them. The opportunity to expand geometry
so as to include the laws of dynamics was offered by its generalization
into many-dimensional and non-Euclidean space, and this was accomplished
by work in pure mathematics, before any empirical investigation of these
results could even be imagined. Minkowski took the first step in 1908 by
presenting a geometry which expressed the special theory of relativity,
and which included classical dynamics as a limiting case. The laws of
physical dynamics now appeared as geometrical theorems of a
four-dimensional non-Euclidean space. Subsequent investigation by
Einstein led, by a further generalization of this type of geometry, to
the general theory of relativity, its postulates being so chosen as to
produce invariant expressions with regard to all frames of reference
assumed to be physically equivalent. As a result of these postulates,
the trajectories of masses follow geodetics, and light is propagated
along zero lines. When the laws of physics thus appear as particular
instances of geometrical theorems, we may infer that the confidence
placed in physical theory owes much to its possessing the same kind of
excellence from which pure geometry and pure mathematics in general
derive their interest, and for the sake of which they are
cultivated.</p>
