<h4 id="universal-doubt">11. UNIVERSAL DOUBT</h4>
<p>What meaning can we attach in this light to a principle of universal
doubt? So long as the reconsideration of any single belief is undertaken
against an overwhelming background of unquestioned beliefs, the beliefs
forming this background cannot simultaneously be alleged to be doubtful.
Though every element of our belief can conceivably be confronted in its
turn with all the rest, it is inconceivable that all should be subject
simultaneously to this operation. But this is not to say that a system
of beliefs can never be doubted as a whole. Euclidean geometry was
called in question as a whole and reduced to an optional status by the
establishment of non-Euclidean geometry. We might conceivably feel
inclined to reconsider one day our acceptance of mathematics as a whole.
I have admitted already that the decline of religious faith entailed a
genuine reduction in the volume of our beliefs.</p>
<p>Such speculations may serve to indicate a meaning of universal doubt
which is free from self-contradiction. We may imagine an indefinite
extension of the process of abandoning hitherto accepted systems of
articulation, together with the theories formulated in these terms or
implied in our use of them. This kind of doubt might eventually lead to
the relinquishing, without compensation, of all existing means of
articulation. It would make us forget all hitherto used idioms and
dissolve all concepts which these idioms conveyed. Our articulate
intellectual life, which operates by the handling of denotable concepts,
would thus be reduced to abeyance for the time being.</p>
<p>Such an interpretation of universal doubt would certainly be
repudiated by the adherents of the principle of doubt, but I can see no
grounds on which they can dissent from it. This is the only manner of
doubting which could truly liberate our minds from uncritically acquired
preconceived beliefs. If we cannot accept the justification of holding
beliefs uncritically, then our only logical alternative is to wipe out
all such preconceived beliefs. And if this proves difficult in practice,
we must at least recognize it as our ideal of perfection. We must accept
the virgin mind, bearing the imprint of no authority, as the model of
intellectual integrity.</p>
<p>At the risk of labouring the obvious, it should be made quite clear
what exactly is implied in this assumption of a mind which could shape
its judgment on all questions without any preconceived opinions. It
cannot mean the mind of a newborn child, since this yet lacks sufficient
intelligence to grasp any problems and discover any solutions for them.
A virgin mind must be allowed to mature until the age at which it
reaches its full natural powers of intelligence, but would have to be
kept unshaped until then by any kind of education. It must be taught no
language, for speech can be acquired only a-critically, and the practice
of speech in one particular language carries with it the acceptance of
the particular theory of the universe postulated by that language.</p>
<p>An entirely untutored maturing of the mind would, however, result in
a state of imbecility. The emotional and appetitive impulses that are
inherent in animal life will of course pour into such channels as are
available to them. In the absence of a rational conceptual framework to
guide them, their manifestation will not be sceptically restrained but
frantic and inchoate. We have observed this already in animals well
below the human level. I have mentioned how chickens brought up in
isolation were perplexed and behaved confusedly, reflecting desperate
consternation, when confronted for the first time with other
chicks.37</p>
<p>Yet even such dumb creatures would not be prevented from forming
conceptions which seriously prejudiced a critical detachment. We have
seen already how the mind actively participates in our sensory awareness
of things (p. 97). Sometimes this way of seeing things is mistaken, and
such instinctive error may gravely hamper the progress of philosophy and
science. The contrast between a body ‘at rest’ and ‘in motion’ is
compelling in all visual perception. We see the earth at absolute rest,
with the sun, the moon and the stars swinging round it as their centre.
The geocentric world view has a firm support in our most primitive
perceptive prejudices. Indeed, even in Newtonian mechanics, the solar
system was regarded in its turn as fixed, with the rest of the universe
moving around it; and this prejudice was finally discarded only in
Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Today the Newtonian framework
is condemned as the product of uncritical thought; yet its error can be
traced back to the lowest level of visual perception and would therefore
be committed even by children raised among wolves or nursed to maturity
in the solitude of an incubator.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the ideal of a virgin mind is to be pursued to its
logical limit, we have to face the fact that every perception of things,
particularly by our eyes, involves implications about the nature of
things which could be false. Whether we see an object as black or white
is not determined by the amount of light it sends into our eye. Snow
seen at dusk appears white, a dinner jacket seen in sunshine appears
black, though the jacket in this case sends more light into the eyes
than the snow. It is said that black is black and white is white—yet
whether we see an object as black or white is decisively affected by the
whole context in which the light from the object reaches our eyes. The
way we embody this context in our perception of the colours, sizes,
distances and shapes of the perceived object is determined by our innate
physiological inclinations and their subsequent development under the
influence of our experience. My perceptions today as an adult are
different from those which I had as a new-born baby, and much of this
difference is due to the functioning of convergence, adaptation and
other more complex sensory processes, which are performed according to
principles which may be wrong. But if all these functions could be
eliminated by training myself to look at things again with unperceiving
eyes, letting their images sweep across my retina, like a motion picture
which is continuously slipping through the gate of the projecting
lantern, I would not feel assured of gaining access thereby to a core of
indubitable virgin data. I should merely be blotting out my eyesight,
just as fakirs do when they go into a trance with open eyes. Nor could I
recover my powers of perception by some critically controlled process,
but only by an effort to see again by using my eyes with all their
complex equipment, helped by the postural adjustment of my head and
combined with the awareness of sound, touch and the exploratory motions
of my body—following a process which embodies a whole system of
implications to which I must a-critically commit myself for the time
being. While we can reduce the sum of our conscious acceptances to
varying degrees, and even to nil, by reducing ourselves to a state of
stupor, any given range of awareness seems to involve a correspondingly
extensive set of a-critically accepted beliefs.</p>
<p>Thus the programme of comprehensive doubt collapses and reveals by
its failure the fiduciary rootedness of all rationality.</p>
<p>I do not suggest, of course, that those who advocate philosophic
doubt as a general solvent of error and a cure for all fanaticism would
desire to bring up children without any rational guidance or contemplate
any other scheme of universal hebetation. I am only saying that this
would be what their principles demand. What they actually want is not
expressed but concealed by their declared principles. They want their
own beliefs to be taught to children and accepted by everybody, for they
are convinced that this would save the world from error and strife. In
his Conway Lecture of 1922, republished in 1941, Bertrand Russell
revealed this in a single sentence. After condemning both Bolshevism and
clericalism as two opposite dogmatic teachings, which should both be
combated by philosophic doubt, he sums up by saying: Thus rational doubt
alone, if it could be generated, would suffice to introduce the
Millennium.’ 38 The author’s intention is clear: he intends to spread
certain doubts which he believes to be justified. He does not want us to
believe the doctrines of the Catholic Church, which he denies and
dislikes, and he also wants us to resist Lenin’s teaching of unbridled
revolutionary violence. These disbeliefs are recommended as ‘rational
doubts’. Philosophic doubt is thus kept on the leash and prevented from
calling in question anything that the septic believes in, or from
approving of any doubt that he does not share. The Inquisition’s charge
against Galileo was based on doubt: they accused him of ‘rashness’. The
Pope’s Encyclical ‘Humani Generis’, issued in 1950, continues its
opposition to science on the same lines, by warning Catholics that
evolution is still an unproven hypothesis. Yet no philosophic sceptic
would side with the Inquisition against the Copernican system or with
Pope Pius XII against Darwinism, Lenin and his successors have
elaborated a form of Marxism which doubts the reality of almost
everything that Bertrand Russell and other rationalists teach us to
respect, but these doubts, like those of the Inquisition, are not
endorsed by Western rationalists, presumably because they are not
‘rational doubts’. Since the sceptic does not consider it rational to
doubt what he himself believes, the advocacy of ‘rational doubt’ is
merely the sceptic’s way of advocating his own beliefs. Russell’s
previously quoted sentence should therefore read: ‘The acceptance of
rational beliefs such as my own would suffice to introduce the
Millennium.’ Rationalism expressed in this form would renounce its
illusory principle of doubt and face up to its own fiduciary
foundations.</p>
<p>In the times of Montaigne and Voltaire, rationalism identified itself
with doubt of the supernatural, and rationalists called this ‘doubt’ as
opposed to ‘belief’. This practice was excusable at the time, since the
beliefs held by rationalists—for example, in the supremacy of reason,
and in science as an application of reason to nature—had not yet been
effectively challenged by scepticism. In propagating their own beliefs
the early rationalists were opposing traditional authority on so wide a
front that they could well regard themselves as radical sceptics. But
the beliefs of rationalism have since been effectively called in
question by the revolutionary doctrines of Marxism and Nazism. It is
absurd to oppose such doctrines now on the ground of scepticism. For
they gained their present ascendancy only recently by a sweeping
rejection of Western tradition, and it is rationalism which today relies
on tradition—the tradition of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries—against them. It should also have become clear by this time
that the beliefs transmitted by this now imperilled tradition are by no
means self-evident. Modern fanaticism is rooted in an extreme scepticism
which can only be strengthened, not shaken, by further doses of
universal doubt.</p>
