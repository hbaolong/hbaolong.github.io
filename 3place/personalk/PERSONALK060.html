<h4 id="naked-power">9. NAKED POWER</h4>
<p>But let us remember the facts of power and material ends. Though men
be harmoniously guided by their agreed convictions, they must yet form a
government to enforce their purpose. Civic culture can flourish only
thanks to physical coercion. It is sown in corruption. We must expose
now the instability of our moral beliefs in face of this fact.</p>
<p>It may be that strictly speaking nobody can be forced to do anything.
During the past wars and revolutions many prisoners have endured
tortures of utmost cruelty, steadfastly refusing to betray secrets
entrusted to them or to give false evidence against innocent persons.
When some yielded to torture combined with ‘brainwashing’, this may have
meant an enforced change of personality, such as is achieved by drugs,
by brain surgery or by treatments which induce a neurosis or psychosis—a
change which it is not in the nature of man’s will to resist. Yet we
have to admit all the same that most men can be induced to bend their
will and reluctantly to obey commands given under sufficiently serious
threats: a yielding which may properly be said to be compelled by
force.</p>
<p>Indeed, all commands issued with some kind of threat behind them are
to this extent coercive, and laws must be effectively coercive, since
otherwise they create injustices by rewarding the law-breakers at the
expense of the law-abiders. While it is not inconceivable that laws may
be enforced by mere moral disapproval, we need not consider such a
remote possibility, particularly since it would hardly alter our
conclusion that coercion is both possible and indispensable in human
society.</p>
<p>It is commonly assumed that power cannot be exercised without some
voluntary support, as for example by a faithful praetorian guard.22 I do
not think this is true, for it seems that some dictators were feared by
everybody; for example, towards the end of his rule everyone feared
Stalin. It is, in fact, easy to see that a single individual might well
exercise command over a multitude of men without appreciable voluntary
support on the part of any of them. If in a group of men each believes
that all the others will obey the commands of a person claiming to be
their common superior, all will obey this person as their superior. For
each will fear that if he disobeyed him, the others would punish his
disobedience at the superior’s command, and so all are forced to obey by
the mere supposition of the others’ continued obedience, without any
voluntary support being given to the superior by any member of the
group. Each member of the group would even feel compelled to report any
signs of dissatisfaction among his comrades, for he would fear that any
complaint made in his presence might be a test applied to him by an
agent provocateur and that he would be punished if he failed to report
such subversive utterances. Thus the members of the group might be kept
so distrustful of each other, that they would express even in private
only sentiments of loyalty towards a superior whom they all hated in
secret. The stability of such naked power increases with the size of the
group under its control, for a disaffected nucleus which might be formed
locally by a lucky crystallization of mutual trust among a small number
of personal associates, would be overawed and paralysed by the vast
surrounding masses of people whom they would assume to be still loyal to
the dictator. Hence it is easier to keep control by force of a vast
country than of the crew of a single ship in mid-ocean. And hence also
it is the standard tactics of an insurrection to spread the rumour that
insurrections have broken out already in other places.</p>
<p>This principle of naked power seems indubitably real and effective.
It is difficult to imagine any exercise of power that is quite free from
a coefficient of this kind, and a regime of terror may well rely
preponderantly on this principle. At the same time, no continued
exercise of supreme power is likely to consist merely in coercion. For
no ruler (this side of sanity) could go on commanding his subjects
without some public purpose in mind, nor his subjects go on living by
his orders without accepting this purpose to some extent, and no
dictator (unless mad) would forgo the measure of popularity which such
inclination towards rational conduct would gain for his regime. We may
expect, in fact, that no dictator will fail to use his coercive powers
for inculcating loyalty to himself in his subjects. For if everybody can
be convinced to some extent that it is right to obey and wrong to resist
his power, incipient disaffection will be discouraged by a sense of
being wrong; and if it is manifested in spite of this, its voice may be
silenced by the mere weight of social disapprobation. A claim to
legitimacy is a most formidable instrument of power. Even men like
Hitler and Stalin, who had perfected to the utmost the machinery of
naked power, have never ceased to supplement it by a flow of public
self-justification.23</p>
<p>Attempts at self-justification will involve the acceptance of a
measure of consistency in the wielding of power, according to rules and
policies which might be regarded as reasonable by the governed. The more
reasonable the rules appear to be, the more assured will be the
government which imposed them, but also the more restricted will become
in consequence the range of its decisions. Indeed, any argument—however
mendacious and absurd—that naked power might invoke in its own support,
necessarily accredits some widely acceptable principles on which the
argument rests. The conversations of Stalin and Hitler reveal that, in
spite of their cynicism, they were convinced of the rightness of their
despotic rule and that, except while engaged in some specific piece of
treachery, they interpreted the world in terms not very different from
those used in their own propaganda.24</p>
<p>People under totalitarian dictatorship may bitterly dislike their
rulers. But so long as these effectively prevent the formation of an
independent intellectual leadership, even a universal repudiation of the
official orthodoxy will produce no alternative movement of thought. In
consequence, official ideologies will frequently be used automatically
by people for the current interpretation of events, even though they do
not support these ideologies. Totalitarianism has clearly demonstrated
that no modern culture—whether individual or civic—can survive, except
by the operation of authoritative institutions.</p>
