<h4 id="commitment">8. COMMITMENT</h4>
<p>We are faced here with the general principle by which our beliefs are
anchored in ourselves. Hammers and probes can be replaced by
intellectual tools; think of any interpretative framework and
particularly of the formalism of the exact sciences. I am not speaking
of the specific assertions which fill the textbooks, but of the
suppositions which underlie the method by which these assertions are
arrived at. We assimilate most of these pre-suppositions by learning to
speak of things in a certain language, in which there are names for
various kinds of objects, names by which objects can be classified,
making such distinctions as between past and present, living and dead,
healthy and sick, and thousands of others. Our language includes the
numerals and the elements of geometry, and it refers in these terms to
laws of nature whence we can pass on to the roots of these laws in
scientific observations and experiments.</p>
<p>The curious thing is that we have no clear knowledge of what our
presuppositions are and when we try to formulate them they appear quite
unconvincing. I have illustrated already in my chapter on probability
how ambiguous and question-begging are all statements of the scientific
method. I suggest now that the supposed pre-suppositions of science are
so futile because the actual foundations of our scientific beliefs
cannot be asserted at all. When we accept a certain set of
pre-suppositions and use them as our interpretative framework, we may be
said to dwell in them as we do in our own body. Their uncritical
acceptance for the time being consists in a process of assimilation by
which we identify ourselves with them. They are not asserted and cannot
be asserted, for assertion can be made only within a framework with
which we have identified ourselves for the time being; as they are
themselves our ultimate framework, they are essentially
inarticulable.11</p>
<p>It is by his assimilation of the framework of science that the
scientist makes sense of experience. This making sense of experience is
a skilful act which impresses the personal participation of the
scientist on the resultant knowledge. It includes the skill of carrying
out correctly the measurements which verify scientific predictions or
the observations by which scientific classifications are applied. And it
includes also connoisseurship, by which the scientist appreciates a
mathematical theory in the abstract—such as the theory of space groups
was until 1912—and equally, the appositeness of such a theory to the
appraisal of observed specimens, for which the theory of space groups
has served since the discovery of the diffraction of X-Rays by crystals
in 1912.</p>
<p>The tracing of personal knowledge to its roots in the subsidiary
awareness of our body as merged in our focal awareness of external
objects, reveals not only the logical structure of personal knowledge
but also its dynamic sources. I have analysed previously the beliefs
which are implied in using an object as a tool. In the new scheme which
I have just drawn up of the process by which an external thing is given
a meaning by being made to form an extension of ourselves, these beliefs
are transposed into more active intentions which draw on our whole
person. In this sense I should say that an object is transformed into a
tool by a purposive effort envisaging an operational field in respect of
which the object guided by our efforts shall function as an extension of
our body. My reliance on it for some end makes an object into a tool,
even though it may not achieve that end. The burning of a man’s nail
pairings for the purpose of bewitching him is an instrumental action
based on a mistaken integration of supposed means to supposed ends.
Similarly, to pronounce a magic formula, to utter a curse or give a
blessing, are verbal actions into which the speaker, confident in their
efficacy, pours meaning. Conversely, where the ends are achieved by
means which are not intended to produce that result, these means have no
instrumental character. If a rat accidentally depresses a lever which
releases a food pellet it has not used it as a tool; only after the rat
has learned to use it for that purpose does the lever become its tool.
Buytendijk has described (as others have done in less detail before him)
the radical change in the behaviour of a rat when it has learned to run
a maze.12 The animal ceases to explore the details of the walls and
corners on its way and attends to these now merely as signposts. It
seems to have lost its focal awareness of them and developed instead a
subsidiary awareness of them which now forms part of the pursuit of its
purpose.</p>
<p>I have said that a tool is only one example of the merging of a thing
in a whole (or a gestalt) in which it is assigned a subsidiary function
and a meaning in respect to something that has our focal attention. I
generalized this structural analysis to include the recognition of signs
as indications of subsequent events and the process of establishing
symbols for things which they shall signify. We may apply to these cases
also what has just been said about a tool. Like the tool, the sign or
the symbol can be conceived as such only in the eyes of a person who
relies on them to achieve or to signify something. This reliance is a
personal commitment which is involved in all acts of intelligence by
which we integrate some things subsidiarily to the centre of our focal
attention. Every act of personal assimilation by which we make a thing
form an extension of ourselves through our subsidiary awareness of it,
is a commitment of ourselves; a manner of disposing of ourselves.</p>
<p>But the context of purpose and commitment, as found inherent in the
personal contribution of the knower to his knowledge, yet lacks dynamic
character. The pouring out of ourselves into the particulars given by
experience so as to make sense of them for some purpose or in some other
coherent context, is not achieved effortlessly. Take the way we acquire
the use of a tool or a probe. If, as seeing men, we are blindfolded, we
cannot find our way about with a stick as skilfully as a blind man does
who has practised it for a long time. We can feel that the stick hits
something from time to time but cannot correlate these events. We can
learn to do this only by an intelligent effort at constructing a
coherent perception of the things hit by the stick. We then gradually
cease to feel a series of jerks in our fingers as such—as we still do in
our first clumsy trials—but experience them as the presence of obstacles
of certain hardness and shape, placed at a certain distance, at the
point of our stick. We may say, more generally, that by the effort by
which I concentrate on my chosen plane of operation I succeed in
absorbing all the elements of the situation of which I might otherwise
be aware in themselves, so that I become aware of them now in terms of
the operational results achieved through their use.</p>
<p>When the new interpretation of the shocks in our fingers is achieved
in terms of the objects touched by the stick, we may be said to carry
out unconsciously the process of interpreting the shocks. And again, in
practical terms, as we learn to handle a hammer, a tennis racket or a
motor car in terms of the situation which we are striving to master, we
become unconscious of the actions by which we achieve this result. This
lapse into unconsciousness is accompanied by a newly acquired
consciousness of the experiences in question, on the operational plane.
It is misleading, therefore, to describe this as the mere result of
repetition; it is a structural change achieved by a repeated mental
effort aiming at the instrumentaliza-tion of certain things and actions
in the service of some purpose.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>UNSPECIFIABILITY</li>
</ol>
<p>We can now answer the problem of unspecifiability with which I
started on this examination of skills. If a set of particulars which
have subsided into our subsidiary awareness lapses altogether from our
consciousness, we may end up by forgetting about them altogether and may
lose sight of them beyond recall. In this sense they may have become
unspecifiable. However, this seems only a minor reason for
unspecifiability, which is accounted for essentially by a somewhat
different, if closely related process.</p>
<p>A mental effort has a heuristic effect: it tends to incorporate any
available elements of the situation which are helpful for its purpose.
Köhler has described this for the case of a practical effort, made by an
ape in the presence of an object which may serve as a tool. The animal’s
insight, he says, reorganizes its field of vision so that the useful
object meets his eye as a tool. We may add that this will hold not only
of objects which are made use of as tools, but also of the performer’s
own muscular actions which may subserve his purpose. If these actions
are experienced only subsidiarily, in terms of an achievement to which
they contribute, its performance may select from them those which the
performer finds helpful, without ever knowing these as they would appear
to him when considered in themselves. This is the usual process of
unconscious trial and error by which we feel our way to success and may
continue to improve on our success without specifiably knowing how we do
it—for we never meet the causes of our success as identifiable things
which can be described in terms of classes of which such things are
members. This is how you invent a method of swimming without knowing
that it consists in regulating your breath in a particular manner, or
discover the principle of cycling without realizing that it consists in
the adjustment of your momentary direction and velocity, so as to
counteract continuously your momentary accidental unbalance. Hence the
practical discovery of a wide range of not consciously known rules of
skill and connoisseurship which comprise important technical processes
that can rarely be completely specified, and even then only as a result
of extensive scientific research.</p>
<p>The unspecifiability of the process by which we thus feel our way
forward accounts for the possession by humanity of an immense mental
domain, not only of knowledge but of manners, of laws and of the many
different arts which man knows how to use, comply with, enjoy or live
by, without specifiably knowing their contents. Each single step in
acquiring this domain was due to an effort which wént beyond the
hitherto assured capacity of some person making it, and by his
subsequent realization and maintenance of his success. It relied on an
act of groping which originally passed the understanding of its agent
and of which he has ever since remained only subsidiarily aware, as part
of a complex achievement.</p>
<p>All these curious properties and implications of personal knowledge
go back to what I have previously described as its logical
unspecifiability; that is to the disorganizing effect caused by
switching our attention to the parts of a whole. We can now appreciate
this effect too in dynamic terms.</p>
<p>Since we originally gained control over the parts in question in
terms of their contribution to a reasonable result, they have never been
known and were still less willed in themselves, and therefore to
transpose a significant whole into the terms of its constituent elements
is to transpose it into terms deprived of any purpose or meaning. Such
dismemberment leaves us with the bare, relatively objective facts, which
had formed the clues for a supervening personal fact. It is a
destructive analysis of personal knowledge in terms of the underlying
relatively objective knowledge.</p>
<p>I have described the effort which we put into acquiring the art of
knowing as the attempt to assimilate certain particulars as extensions
of our body, so that by becoming imbued with our subsidiary awareness
they may form a coherent focal entity. This is an action, but one that
has always an element of passivity in it. We can assimilate an object as
a tool if we believe it to be actually useful to our purposes and the
same holds for the relation of meaning to what is meant and the relation
of the parts to a whole. The act of personal knowing can sustain these
relations only because the acting person believes that they are
apposite: that he has not made them but discovered them. The effort of
knowing is thus guided by a sense of obligation towards the truth: by an
effort to submit to reality.</p>
<p>Moreover, since every act of personal knowing appreciates the
coherence of certain particulars, it implies also submission to certain
standards of coherence. While the athlete or the dancer putting forward
their best, act as critics of their own performances, connoisseurs are
acknowledged as critics of the goodness of specimens. All personal
knowing appraises what it knows by a standard set to itself.</p>
