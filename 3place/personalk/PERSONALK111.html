<h4 id="action-and-perception">5. ACTION AND PERCEPTION</h4>
<p>I have surveyed so far the being, the growing and the functioning of
organisms as subject matters of knowledge. These vegetative manners of
living are common to plants and animals; yet they are usually more
striking and better known in animals, and hence I took my examples from
zoology. The examination of biology as a knowledge of action and
perception, to which I shall now proceed, will apply exclusively to the
study of animals. Action will be taken here to differ, by being
deliberate, from the mere functioning of organs. This assumes the
prompting of a conscious motive which I shall call a drive.38 The term
‘perception’ will be applied here in its usual sense, to designate the
process of getting to know an external object by the impression made by
it on our senses. Disregarding thus the earlier stage of protopathic
sentience, I shall envisage perception from the start as consciously
discriminating, even though not yet capable of strenuous deliberation.
This stage corresponds about to the transition by which human beings
emerge from childish autism and recognize the world outside as a field
of hazardous doing and knowing.</p>
<p>At the level of being, of growing, or of functioning, an individual
could fail through being abnormal, malformed or diseased. The active,
perceiving person has two more possibilities for going wrong, namely,
subjectivity and error; and again, it falls to the observer to
appreciate the rightness which is impaired by these shortcomings. You
cannot observe deliberate action or perception except by legislating for
it in these respects.</p>
<p>Take the feeding of a higher animal as an example of conscious
action. This may be defined as the ingestion of food. But since we
recognize as ‘food’ only materials which we believe to be nutritive, or
at least not deleterious to the animal, it falls to us to this extent to
determine what is right feeding. This is often far from obvious. When a
sheep eats the wool off the back of another sheep, or cattle eat bones,
the uninstructed may object to this as an aberration, but physiologists
approve of it as a compensation for certain mineral deficiencies in the
animal’s diet. Yet not everything that animals eat is nutritive or even
wholesome. It is easy to poison animals by arsenic or strychnine, or to
deceive them as the angler does by his fly. Rats will drink saccharine
solution, which has no nutritive value, and captive apes eat their
faeces, which seem to be quite useless as food. In all these cases it is
the observer’s judgment which appraises what is right and what is wrong
feeding.</p>
<p>The nature of this judgment is qualified by the fact that feeding is
normally actuated by a drive. The dog-lover is painfully conscious of
his dog’s hunger when it whines for food; the rat’s enjoyment of a sweet
taste is the only reason that can be found for its feeding on a solution
of saccharine. In recognizing this we acknowledge the presence of a
rational centre in the animal, to which we attribute both its correct
and its mistaken decisions. In this sense we shall deprecate the
drinking of a saccharine solution in a rat, as offering a purely
subjective satisfaction, and class the swallowing of an angler’s fly by
a fish as a reasonable error in an otherwise altogether rational way of
feeding. On the other hand, we shall deny to a maniac devouring paper or
sand any degree of rationality; this kind of false feeding will be
classed as a meaningless act. It is a compulsive pathological process,
endured by the diseased mind and as such to be classed with purely
passive bodily malformations.</p>
<p>The process of perception has a similar logical structure. An object
approaching the eye is seen as constant, so long as a certain
relationship prevails between the effort of accommodation and the size
of the retinal image. More precisely, we are jointly aware of the
retinal image and of the adaptive effort, as well as of certain
relations of the two, while both are undergoing a change, in terms of
the constant size of an object seen at variable distances. The observer
of this process of perception will regard it as a correct performance if
he himself endorses the affirmations implied in it, namely that the
object did in fact remain of constant size. But it may happen, as in the
experiments of Ames already mentioned, that unnoticed by the subject,
the observer alters the size of the object—a rubber-ball—by inflating
it. We have seen that the subject may then increase his accommodation as
if the object were approaching him and become aware of this increased
effort in its conjunction with an increased retinal image, by seeing the
swelling object as coming nearer at constant size. In this case the
seeing of a constant size may be regarded as a reasonable error. On the
other hand, if the effort required for a certain measure of
accommodation is increased by atropin poisoning, an approaching object
will be seen shrinking to a tiny size and the reduction of its size will
make it appear farther off; but owing to our knowledge that this cannot
be true we shall know this anomalous appearance to be deceptive.39 We
shall regard it then as a subjective experience of the perceiving person
which is rational from his own point of view, but not otherwise.40 And
again, we know of hallucinations, the falsity of which cannot be
accounted for either by subjective rationality or reasonable error; they
are devoid of reason.</p>
<p>We have met here some primitive forms of commitment, and biology has
been revealed as an appreciation of commitment. To swallow something in
the hope that it may be wholesome is clearly a commitment, and so is
every act of seeing things in one particular way. I have suggested
before that in a generalized sense commitment may be acknowledged even
at the vegetative level, since it is of the essence of a living organism
that each part relies for its function, and for its very meaning as part
of the organism, on the presence and proper functioning of a number of
other parts.41 In this sense our knowledge of the normal growth,
functioning and being of the organism is an appraisal of its primordial
commitments which accredits their success. Commitment may then be graded
by steps of increasing consciousness; namely, from primordial,
vegetative commitment of a centre of being, function and growth, to
primitive commitment of the active-perceptive centre, and hence further
again, to responsible commitments of the consciously deliberating
person. The aphorism that biology is life reflecting on itself now
acquires a fuller meaning. Biology is a responsible commitment which
appraises other commitments. In its usual narrower sense, biology is a
responsible commitment which appraises primordial and primitive
commitments. But I shall break through the limitation implied in this
formulation and proceed presently to consider the appraisal of
responsible commitments (which includes the justification of my own
convictions) as the extension of an ascending series of biological
observations beyond biology, into a domain that may be called
‘ultrabiology’.</p>
<p>I have dealt before with the molar features that characterize the
vegetative level; let me now sum up the new features that are added to
these on the active-perceptive level. They are sentience of motive and
knowledge; an effort to do right and know truly; a belief that there
exists an independent reality which makes these endeavours meaningful,
and a sense for the consequent hazards.</p>
<p>On the morphological and vegetative level we had only two classes of
appraisal: namely normality and abnormality: health or disease. The
intervention of sentience enlarges our scale to four significant
classes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>a correct satisfaction of normal standards,</p></li>
<li><p>a mistaken satisfaction of normal standards,</p></li>
<li><p>action or perception satisfying subjective, illusory
standards,</p></li>
<li><p>mental derangement issuing in meaningless reactions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first three kinds of appraisals are those of a normal individual,
the fourth case is pathological. This classification shows that the
presence in a living being of sentience, purposive action and the
knowing of external things elevates our knowledge of the living being
into a critical meeting of it. By including a critique of the handling
and the knowing of things by its subjects, biology becomes
three-storied. Our personal knowing becomes then the perceiving of an
actively intended meaning, which we are trying both to understand and to
judge with a view to the facts on which it bears. It is, in fact, the
reception of a convivial communication, subject to its critical
appraisal by ourselves.</p>
<p>Our understanding of the hungry animal choosing its food, or of an
animal on the alert listening, watching and reacting to what it notices,
is an act of personal knowing similar in its structure to the animal’s
own personal act which our knowing of it appraises. And accordingly, our
knowledge of the active-perceptive animal would dissolve altogether if
we replaced it by our focal knowledge of its several manifestations.
Only by being aware of these particulars subsidiarily, in relation to a
focal awareness of the animal as an individual, can we know what the
animal is doing and knowing. Besides, when the subsidiary particulars of
a comprehensive entity are as highly complex and variable as in these
cases, attempts to specify them can do no more than highlight some
features, the meaning of which will continue to depend on an
unspecifiable background that we only know within our understanding of
the entity in question. In other words, the meaning of an animal’s
actions can be understood only by reading the particulars of its actions
(or by reading its mind in terms of these actions) and not by observing
the actions themselves as we may observe inanimate processes.</p>
<p>Behaviourists teach that in observing an animal we must refrain above
all from trying to imagine what we would do if placed in the animal’s
position. I suggest, on the contrary, that nothing at all could be known
about an animal that would be of the slightest interest to physiology,
and still less to psychology, except by following the opposite maxim of
identifying ourselves with a centre of action in the animal and
criticizing its performance by standards set up for it by ourselves.</p>
