<h4 id="thought-and-speech.-i.-text-and-meaning">5. THOUGHT AND SPEECH.
I. TEXT AND MEANING</h4>
<p>These recurrent suggestions regarding the participation of the tacit
in the process of articulation must remain obscure until we define the
process by which the tacit co-operates with the explicit, the personal
with the formal. But we are not yet ready for a frontal attack on this
question. We must examine first three characteristic areas in which the
relation between speech and thought varies from one extreme type to an
opposite extreme, through the intermediary of a balanced type, lying
midway between them. These three areas are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The area where the tacit predominates to the extent that
articulation is virtually impossible; we may call this the ineffable
domain.</p></li>
<li><p>The area where the tacit component is the information conveyed by
easily intelligible speech, so that the tacit is co-extensive with the
text of which it carries the meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>The area in which the tacit and the formal fall apart, since the
speaker does not know, or quite know, what he is talking about. There
are two extremely different cases of this, namely (a) an ineptitude of
speech, owing to which articulation encumbers the tacit work of thought;
(b) symbolic operations that outrun our understanding and thus
anticipate novel modes of thought. Both (a) and (b) may be said to form
part of the domain of sophistication.</p></li>
<li><p>When I speak of ineffable knowledge, this should be taken
literally and not as a designation of mystic experience, to which I do
not wish to refer at this stage. Even so my attempt to speak of the
ineffable may be thought to be logically meaningless,28 or
alternatively, to offend against the Cartesian doctrine of ‘clear and
distinct ideas’ which the early Wittgenstein transposed into terms of
semantics in his aphorism: ‘Of what cannot be said’—i.e. said exactly,
as a sentence in natural science—‘thereof one must be silent’.29 The
answer to both objections lies ready in the mass of observations
presented in Part One and in the foregoing sections of Part Two, which
have demonstrated everywhere the limits of formalization. These
observations show that strictly speaking nothing that we know can be
said precisely;30 and so what I call ‘ineffable’ may simply mean
something that I know and can describe even less precisely than usual,
or even only very vaguely. It is not difficult to recall such ineffable
experiences, and philosophic objections to doing so invoke quixotic
standards of valid meaning which, if rigorously practised, would reduce
us all to voluntary imbecility. This will become clearer as we proceed
to perform what such objections would condemn as meaningless or
impossible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What I shall say of ineffability will in fact cover largely the same
ground which I have previously traversed for the demonstration of the
unspecifiability of personal knowledge; the difference being that I
shall now regard the unspecifiable part of knowledge as the residue left
unsaid by a defective articulation. Such defectiveness is common and
often glaring. I may ride a bicycle and say nothing, or pick out my
macintosh among twenty others and say nothing. Though I cannot say
clearly how I ride a bicycle nor how I recognize my macintosh (for I
don’t know it clearly), yet this will not prevent me from saying that I
know how to ride a bicycle and how to recognize my macintosh. For I know
that I know perfectly well how to do such things, though I know the
particulars of what I know only in an instrumental manner and am focally
quite ignorant of them; so that I may say that I know these matters even
though I cannot tell clearly, or hardly at all, what it is that I
know.</p>
<p>Subsidiary or instrumental knowledge, as I have defined it, is not
known in itself but is known in terms of something focally known, to the
quality of which it contributes; and to this extent it is unspecifiable.
Analysis may bring subsidiary knowledge into focus and formulate it as a
maxim or as a feature in a physiognomy, but such specification is in
general not exhaustive. Although the expert diagnostician, taxonomist
and cotton-classer can indicate their clues and formulate their maxims,
they know many more things than they can tell, knowing them only in
practice, as instrumental particulars, and not explicitly, as objects.
The knowledge of such particulars is therefore ineffable, and the
pondering of a judgment in terms of such particulars is an ineffable
process of thought. This applies equally to con-noisseurship as the art
of knowing and to skills as the art of doing, wherefore both can be
taught only by aid of practical example and never solely by precept.</p>
<p>But the relationship of the particulars jointly forming a whole may
be ineffable, even though all the particulars are explicitly
specifiable. The subject matter of topographic anatomy is such an
ineffable relationship and will serve us as an example to illustrate the
principle of this type of ineffability.</p>
<p>The medical student first learns a list of bones, arteries, nerves,
and viscera which constitutes systematic anatomy. This is hard on the
memory, but mostly presents no difficulty to the understanding, for the
characteristic parts of the body can usually be clearly identified by
diagrams. The major difficulty in the understanding, and hence in the
teaching of anatomy, arises in respect to the intricate
three-dimensional network of organs closely packed inside the body, of
which no diagram can give an adequate representation. Even dissection,
which lays bare a region and its organs by removing the parts overlaying
it, does not demonstrate more than one aspect of that region. It is left
to the imagination to reconstruct from such experience the
three-dimensional picture of the exposed area as it existed in the
unopened body, and to explore mentally its connections with adjoining
unexposed areas around it and below it.</p>
<p>The kind of topographic knowledge which an experienced surgeon
possesses of the regions on which he operates is therefore ineffable
knowledge. In saying this, I disregard altogether the act of personal
knowing involved in forming the conceptions of normal anatomy from a
great number of actual instances which vary in detail. Let all human
bodies be taken as absolutely identical, and let it be assumed that we
have unlimited time and patience for mapping out the internal organs of
the body. Let the body be cut for this purpose into a thousand thin
slices and each cross section be depicted in detail; and let us even
grant for full measure that, by a superhuman feat of cramming, a student
could memorize precisely the picture of all the thousand cross sections.
He would know a set of data which fully determine the spatial
arrangement of the organs in the body; yet he would not know that
spatial arrangement itself. Indeed, the cross-sections which he knows
would be incomprehensible and useless to him, until he could interpret
them in the light of this so far unknown arrangement; while on the other
hand, had he achieved this topographic understanding, he could derive an
indefinite amount of further new and significant information from his
understanding, just as one reads off itineraries from a map. Such
processes of inference, which may involve sustained efforts of
intelligence, are ineffable thoughts.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of the powers of mapping, of which we have here an
extreme case, set in already the moment we pass from the mapping of
objects lying on a plane to objects on a curved surface. We can map the
whole surface of the earth on a flat sheet of paper only in the form of
a distorted projection, while its representation by a globe is clumsy
and shows only one hemisphere at a time. This inadequacy is increased to
the level of an impossibility when we come to an intricate
three-dimensional arrangement of closely packed opaque objects. Diagrams
or demonstrations of instructive aspects of the aggregate will now
merely offer clues to its understanding, while understanding itself must
be achieved by a difficult act of personal insight, the result of which
must remain inarticulate.31</p>
<p>We have now two inadequacies of articulation before us; different and
yet closely related. When I am riding a bicycle or picking out my
macintosh, I do not know the particulars of my knowledge and therefore
cannot tell what they are; when on the other hand I know the topography
of a complex three-dimensional aggregate, I know and could describe its
particulars, but cannot describe their spatial interrelations. The
limitations of articulation are correspondingly different in the two
cases. When arts of knowing are explained by maxims, these never
disclose fully the subsidiarily known particulars of the art, so that
the powers of articulation are already restricted at this stage. No such
limitation is imposed on the articulation of a spatial topography, the
particulars of which are fully accessible. The difficulty lies here
entirely in the subsequent integration of the particulars, and the
inadequacy of articulation consists altogether in the fact that the
latter process is left without formal guidance. The degree of
intelligence required from the student to perform the act of insight
which ultimately conveys to him the knowledge of the topography, offers
here a measure of the limitations of the articulation representing this
topography.</p>
<p>This ineffable domain of skilful knowing is continuous in its
inarticulateness with the knowledge possessed by animals and infants,
who, as we have seen, also possess the capacity for reorganizing their
inarticulate knowledge and using it as an interpretative framework. The
anatomist exploring by dissection a complex topography is in fact using
his intelligence very much like a rat running a maze; and since he
cannot tell any more than the rat what he gets to know in this way, his
understanding of topographic anatomy remains similar in this respect as
well to that which rats acquire of a maze. We may say in general that by
acquiring a skill, whether muscular or intellectual, we achieve an
understanding which we cannot put into words and which is continuous
with the inarticulate faculties of animals.</p>
<p>What I understand in this manner has a meaning for me, and it has
this meaning in itself, and not as a sign has a meaning when denoting an
object. I have called this earlier on an existential meaning.32 Since
animals have no language which could denote anything, we may describe
all meaning of the kind that is understood by animals as existential.
The learning of signs, which is the first step towards denotation, would
then be only a special case of existential meaning, but when we come to
a deliberately chosen system of signs, constituting a language, we must
admit that these have a denotative meaning which is not inherent in a
fixed context of things or actions.33</p>
<p>Now that I have spoken at some length of the ineffable, it is easier
to see why this is neither impossible nor self-contradictory. To assert
that I have knowledge which is ineffable is not to deny that I can speak
of it, but only that I can speak of it adequately, the assertion itself
being an appraisal of this inadequacy. Reflections of the kind that I
made a moment ago, when recalling the particular contents of our
knowledge which we cannot adequately specify, have served to
substantiate the inadequacy of our articulation for the cases in
question. Such reflections must of course appeal ultimately to the very
sense of inadequacy which they intend to justify. They do not try to
eliminate, but only to evoke more vividly our sense of inadequate
representation, by persevering in the direction of greater precision and
reflecting on the ultimate failure of this attempt.</p>
<p>I believe that we should accredit in ourselves the capacity for
appraising our own articulation. Indeed, all our strivings towards
precision imply our reliance on such a capacity. To deny or even doubt
our possession of it would discredit any effort to express ourselves
correctly, and the very conception of words as consistently used
utterances would dissolve if we failed to accredit this capacity. This
does not imply that this capacity is infallible, but merely that we are
competent to exercise it and must ultimately rely on our exercise of it.
This we must admit if we are to speak at all, which I believe to be
incumbent on us to do.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Having acknowledged our own capacity to distinguish what we know
from what we may be saying about it, we are free to distinguish also
between hearing a message and knowing what it conveys to us.34 We may
recall in this connection once more how, having just read a letter, I no
longer knew in what language it was written, though I knew its content
precisely.35 The knowledge that I had acquired was the meaning of the
message. This kind of knowledge, or meaning, resembles in its tacitness
the kinds of knowledge that I have described as ineffable, but differs
from them profoundly by its verbal origin. While I read the letter, I
was consciously aware both of its text and of the meaning of the text,
but my awareness of the text was merely instrumental to that of the
meaning, so that the text was transparent in respect to its meaning.
After putting the letter down, I lost my conscious awareness of the
text, but remained subsidiarily aware of it in terms of my inarticulate
knowledge of its content.36 Tacit knowledge is manifestly present,
therefore, not only when it exceeds the powers of articulation, but even
when it exactly coincides with them, as it does when we have acquired it
a moment before by listening to or reading a text.37</li>
</ol>
<p>Even while listening to speech or reading a text, our focal attention
is directed towards the meaning of the words, and not towards the words
as sounds or as marks on paper. Indeed, to say that we read or listen to
a text, and do not merely see it or hear it, is precisely to imply that
we are attending focally to what is indicated by the words seen or heard
and not to these words themselves.</p>
<p>But words convey nothing except by a previously acquired meaning,
which may be somewhat modified by their present use, but will not as a
rule have been first discovered on this occasion. In any case, our
knowledge of the things denoted by words will have been largely acquired
by experience, in the same way as animals come to know things, while the
words will have acquired their meaning by previously designating such
experience, either when uttered by others in our presence or when used
by ourselves. Therefore, when I receive information by reading a letter
and when I ponder the message of the letter, I am subsidiarily aware not
only of its text, but also of all the past occasions by which I have
come to understand the words of the text, and the whole range of this
subsidiary awareness is presented focally in terms of the message. This
message or meaning, on which attention is now focussed, is not something
tangible: it is the conception evoked by the text. The conception in
question is the focus of our attention, in terms of which we attend
subsidiarily both to the text and to the objects indicated by the text.
Thus the meaning of a text resides in a focal comprehension of all the
relevant instrumentally known particulars, just as the purpose of an
action resides in the co-ordinated innervation of its instrumentally
used particulars. This is what we mean by saying that we read a text,
and why we do not say that we observe it.</p>
<p>While focal awareness is necessarily conscious, subsidiary awareness
may vary over all degrees of consciousness. When reading a text or
listening to speech we have a completely conscious subsidiary awareness
of it, even while we remain consciously aware of the text also in terms
of its message, to which we keep attending focally. The relation between
words and thought is the same, therefore, whether we have the words
consciously in mind or not. This will allow us to agree with Révész38
that ‘wordless’ thought can be, and often is, founded on language,
without agreeing at the same time to disqualify all ineffable mental
processes as lacking the character of thought. Further comments on this
point will follow.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>I have shown a domain in which both knowledge and thought are of
necessity predominantly tacit, and then a second domain in which the
tacit, on which our attention is focussed, is the meaning of speech to
which we are listening or have just listened.39 The domain of
sophistication, on which we now enter, is formed by not fully understood
symbolic operations which can be</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>a fumbling, to be corrected later by our tacit
understanding</p></li>
<li><p>a pioneering, to be followed up later by our tacit understanding.
More precisely speaking, we should say that we are referring in both
these cases to a state of mental uneasiness due to the feeling that our
tacit thoughts do not agree with our symbolic operations, so that we
have to decide on which of the two we should rely and which we should
correct in the light of the other.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first of these two types of disagreement occurs when children
learn to speak. They often show themselves encumbered rather than
assisted by their new articulate equipment, the operations of which they
have not yet fully mastered. Piaget has observed how often children find
verbal problems intractable, though they know, and have known for a long
time, how to solve the practical problems corresponding to them. He
concludes that all the operations of logic must be learned all over
again on the verbal plane of thought.40</p>
<p>Although the gains made by casting our thoughts into articulate terms
eventually outweigh by far these initial disadvantages, there will
always remain certain chances of error—and even of grave error—which
arise from our very adoption of an articulate interpretative framework.
This risk is therefore inherent in the exercise of all higher forms of
human reason. Animals can make mistakes; rabbits fall into traps, fish
rise to the angler’s fly, and such errors may be fatal. But animals are
exempt from the errors due to elaborate systems of false interpretation,
which can be established only in verbal terms. Animism, belief in
witchcraft, oracles and taboos prevail universally among primitive
people, and a tendency towards kindred superstitions can be found also
in childhood. When superstition is superseded by philosophy and
theology, or by mathematics and natural science, we become involved once
more in new systems of fallacies from which our practice of mathematics,
science, philosophy or theology can never be strictly free. The mind
which entrusts itself to the operation of symbols acquires an
intellectual tool of boundless power; but its use makes the mind liable
to perils the range of which seems also unlimited. The gap between the
tacit and the articulate tends to produce everywhere a cleavage between
sound common sense and dubious sophistication, from which the animal is
quite free.</p>
<p>The linguistic school of philosophy aims at eliminating such
uncertainties by bringing the use of words under stricter control. But
you cannot benefit from the formalization of thought, unless you allow
the formalism which you have adopted to function according to its own
operational principles, and to this extent you must abandon yourself to
this functioning and risk being led into error. Remember how various new
kinds of numbers—irrational, negative, imaginary, transfinite—were
produced as a result of extending familiar mathematical operations into
unexplored regions, and how these numbers, after having first been
repudiated as meaningless, were eventually accepted as denoting
important new mathematical conceptions. Such spectacular gains, achieved
by the speculative use of mathematical notations for purposes not
originally entertained, remind us that the major fruitfulness of a
formalism may be revealed in its entirely uncovenanted functions,
precisely at points where the peril seems greatest of its drifting into
absurdity. Gödel has shown that the scope of mathematical formulae is
indeterminate, in the sense that we cannot decide within a deductive
system like arithmetic whether any set of axioms comprising the system
are consistent or mutually contradictory.41 We must commit ourselves to
the risk of talking complete nonsense, if we are to say anything at all
within any such system.</p>
<p>This is true also for ordinary language applying to matters of
experience. It contains descriptive terms, each of which implies a
generalization affirming the stable or otherwise recurrent nature of
some feature to which it refers, and these testimonies to the reality of
a set of recurrent features constitute, as we have seen (p. 80), a
theory of the universe which is amplified by the grammatical rules
according to which the terms can be combined to form meaningful
sentences. So far as this universal theory is true, it will be found to
anticipate, like other true theories, much more knowledge than was
possessed or even surmised by its originators. We may recall as a crude
model of this how even a small map multiplies a thousandfold the
original input of information; and add to this that, actually, the
number of meaningful and interesting questions one could study by means
of such a map is much greater and not wholly foreseeable. Much less can
we control in advance the myriads of arrangements in which nouns,
adjectives, verbs and adverbs can be meaningfully combined to form new
affirmations or questions, thus developing, as we shall see, the meaning
of the words themselves ever further in these new contexts. Verbal
speculation may therefore reveal an inexhaustible fund of true knowledge
and new substantial problems, just as it may also produce pieces of mere
sophistry.</p>
<p>How shall we distinguish between the two? The question cannot be
fully answered at this stage; but from what has been already said, we
can see, at least in outline, by what method the decision will have to
be reached. Three things will have to be borne in mind: the text, the
conception suggested by it, and the experience on which this may bear.
Our judgment operates by trying to adjust these three to each other. The
outcome cannot be predicted from the previous use of language, for it
may involve a decision to correct, or otherwise to modify, the use of
language. On the other hand, we may decide instead to persist in our
previous usage and to reinterpret experience in terms of some novel
conception suggested by our text, or at least to envisage new problems
leading on to a reinterpretation of experience. And in the third place,
we may decide to dismiss the text as altogether meaningless.</p>
<p>Thus to speak a language is to commit ourselves to the double
indeterminacy due to our reliance both on its formalism and on our own
continued reconsideration of this formalism in its bearing on
experience. For just as, owing to the ultimately tacit character of all
our knowledge, we remain ever unable to say all that we know, so also,
in view of the tacit character of meaning, we can never quite know what
is implied in what we say.42</p>
