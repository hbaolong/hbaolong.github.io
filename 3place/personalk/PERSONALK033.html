<h4 id="thought-and-speech.-ii.-conceptual-decisions">7. THOUGHT AND
SPEECH. II. CONCEPTUAL DECISIONS</h4>
<p>We may now begin to recognize the nature of the tacit faculty which
accounts in the last resort for all the increase in knowledge achieved
by articulation, and the nature of the urge to exercise it. We have seen
this faculty revealed in somewhat different ways in all three
characteristic relations between thought and speech. In the ineffable
domain it made sense of the scanty clues conveyed by speech; in
listening to a readily intelligible text and remembering its message,
the conception grasped by it formed the focus of our attention; and
lastly, it was seen to be the centre of operations for readjusting the
tacit and the formal components of thought, which had fallen apart by a
process of sophistication. The faculty on which we relied in all these
situations was our power for comprehending a text and the things to
which the text refers, within a conception which is the meaning of the
text.</p>
<p>We have seen how the urge to look out for clues and to make sense of
them is ever alert in our eyes and ears, and in our fears and desires.
The urge to understand experience, together with the language referring
to experience, is clearly an extension of this primordial striving for
intellectual control. The shaping of our conceptions is impelled to move
from obscurity to clarity and from incoherence to comprehension, by an
intellectual discomfort similar to that by which our eyes are impelled
to make clear and coherent the things we see. In both cases we pick out
clues which seem to suggest a context in which they make sense as its
subsidiary particulars.</p>
<p>This may resolve the paradox that we intellectually owe so much to
articulation, even though the focus of all articulation is conceptual,
with language playing only a subsidiary part in this focus. For since
the conceptions conveyed by speech, when speech is properly understood,
make us aware both of the way our speech refers to certain things and of
the way these things are constituted in themselves, we can never learn
to speak except by learning to know what is meant by speech. So that
even while our thoughts are of things and not of language, we are aware
of language in all thinking (so far as our thinking surpasses that of
the animals) and can neither have these thoughts without language, nor
understand language without understanding the things to which we attend
in such thoughts.</p>
<p>An illustration—akin to that of topographic anatomy by which we
exemplified the ineffable—may exhibit this dual movement of
comprehension in learning a language. Think of a medical student
attending a course in the X-ray diagnosis of pulmonary diseases. He
watches in a darkened room shadowy traces on a fluorescent screen placed
against a patient’s chest, and hears the radiologist commenting to his
assistants, in technical language, on the significant features of these
shadows. At first the student is completely puzzled. For he can see in
the X-ray picture of a chest only the shadows of the heart and the ribs,
with a few spidery blotches between them. The experts seem to be
romancing about figments of their imagination; he can see nothing that
they are talking about. Then as he goes on listening for a few weeks,
looking carefully at ever new pictures of different cases, a tentative
understanding will dawn on him; he will gradually forget about the ribs
and begin to see the lungs. And eventually, if he perseveres
intelligently, a rich panorama of significant details will be revealed
to him: of physiological variations and pathological changes, of scars,
of chronic infections and signs of acute disease. He has entered a new
world. He still sees only a fraction of what the experts can see, but
the pictures are definitely making sense now and so do most of the
comments made on them. He is about to grasp what he is being taught; it
has clicked. Thus, at the very moment when he has learned the language
of pulmonary radiology, the student will also have learned to understand
pulmonary radiograms. The two can only happen together. Both halves of
the problem set to us by an unintelligible text, referring to an
unintelligible subject, jointly guide our efforts to solve them, and
they are solved eventually together by discovering a conception which
comprises a joint understanding of both the words and the things.</p>
<p>But this duality of speech and knowledge is asymmetrical, in a sense
anticipated on the inarticulate level, in the distinction (apparent
already in the learning of animals) between knowledge and the
performances based on knowledge. We have seen there that the acquisition
of the type of knowledge called latent learning can be manifested by an
indefinite range of performances, depending on the situation with which
the animal is confronted after his training. Indeed, once it has learned
something new, the animal’s every subsequent reaction may be affected to
some extent by its previously acquired knowledge: a fact which is known
as the transfer of learning. And it is easy to see that knowledge, even
when acquired verbally, has a ‘latent’ character; to express it in words
is a performance based on our possession of such latent knowledge.</p>
<p>Take the knowledge of medicine. While the correct use of medical
terms cannot be achieved in itself, without the knowledge of medicine, a
great deal of medicine can be remembered even after one has forgotten
the use of medical terms. Having changed my profession and moved from
Hungary to England, I have forgotten most of the medical terms I learned
in Hungary and have acquired no others in place of them; yet I shall
never again view—for example—a pulmonary radiogram in such a totally
uncomprehending manner as I did before I was trained in radiology. The
knowledge of medicine is retained, just as the message of a letter is
remembered, even after the text which had conveyed either kind of
knowledge has passed beyond recall. To speak of this message, or of
medical matters, is therefore a performance based on knowledge, and it
is indeed only one of an indefinite range of conceivable performances by
which such knowledge can be manifested. We grope for words to tell what
we know and our words hang together by these roots. ‘The true artists of
speech’, writes Vossler,50‘remain always conscious of the metaphorical
character of language. They go on correcting and supplementing one
metaphor by another, allowing their words to contradict each other and
attending only to the unity and certainty of their thought.’ Humphrey51
rightly aligns the capacity to express knowledge in an unlimited variety
of spoken terms, with the capacity of a rat to manifest its knowledge of
a maze in an unlimited number of different actions.</p>
