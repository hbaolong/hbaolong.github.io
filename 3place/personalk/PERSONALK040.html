<h4 id="scientific-value">2. SCIENTIFIC VALUE</h4>
<p>From the start of this book I have had occasion, in various contexts,
to refer to the overwhelming elation felt by scientists at the moment of
discovery, an elation of a kind which only a scientist can feel and
which science alone can evoke in him. In the very first chapter I quoted
the famous passage in which Kepler announced the discovery of his Third
Law: ’. . . nothing holds me; I will indulge my sacred fury . . .’1 The
outbreak of such emotions in the course of discovery is well known, but
they are not thought to affect the outcome of discovery. Science is
regarded as objectively established in spite of its passionate origins.
It should be clear by this time that I dissent from that belief; and I
have now come to the point at which I want to deal explicitly with
passions in science. I want to show that scientific passions are no mere
psychological by-product, but have a logical function which contributes
an indispensable element to science. They respond to an essential
quality in a scientific statement and may accordingly be said to be
right or wrong, depending on whether we acknowledge or deny the presence
of that quality in it.</p>
<p>What is this quality? Passions charge objects with emotions, making
them repulsive or attractive; positive passions affirm that something is
precious. The excitement of the scientist making a discovery is an
intellectual passion, telling that something is intellectually precious
and, more particularly, that it is precious to science. And this
affirmation forms part of science. The words of Kepler which I quoted
were not a statement of fact, but neither were they merely a report of
Kepler’s personal feelings. They asserted as a valid affirmation of
science something else than a fact: namely the scientific interest of
certain facts, the facts just discovered by Kepler. They affirmed,
indeed, that these facts are of immense scientific interest and will be
so regarded as long as knowledge lasts. Nor was Kepler deceived in this
majestic sentiment. The passing centuries have paid their cumulative
tribute to his vision, and so, I believe, will the centuries yet to
come.</p>
<p>The function which I attribute here to scientific passion is that of
distinguishing between demonstrable facts which are of scientific
interest, and those which are not. Only a tiny fraction of all knowable
facts are of interest to scientists, and scientific passion serves also
as a guide in the assessment of what is of higher and what of lesser
interest; what is great in science, and what relatively slight. I want
to show that this appreciation depends ultimately on a sense of
intellectual beauty; that it is an emotional response which can never be
dispassionately defined, any more than we can dispassionately define the
beauty of a work of art or the excellence of a noble action.</p>
<p>Scientific discovery reveals new knowledge, but the new vision which
accompanies it is not knowledge. It is less than knowledge, for it is a
guess; but it is more than knowledge, for it is a foreknowledge of
things yet unknown and at present perhaps inconceivable. Our vision of
the general nature of things is our guide for the interpretation of all
future experience. Such guidance is indispensable. Theories of the
scientific method which try to explain the establishment of scientific
truth by any purely objective formal procedure are doomed to failure.
Any process of enquiry unguided by intellectual passions would
inevitably spread out into a desert of trivialities. Our vision of
reality, to which our sense of scientific beauty responds, must suggest
to us the kind of questions that it should be reasonable and interesting
to explore. It should recommend the kind of conceptions and empirical
relations that are intrinsically plausible and which should therefore be
upheld, even when some evidence seems to contradict them, and tell us
also, on the other hand, what empirical connections to reject as
specious, even though there is evidence for them—evidence that we may as
yet be unable to account for on any other assumptions. In fact, without
a scale of interest and plausibility based on a vision of reality,
nothing can be discovered that is of value to science; and only our
grasp of scientific beauty, responding to the evidence of our senses,
can evoke this vision.</p>
<p>We shall get a firmer hold on this concept of scientific value by
representing it as the joint outcome of three contributing factors. An
affirmation will be acceptable as part of science, and will be the more
valuable to science, the more it possesses:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>certainty (accuracy)</p></li>
<li><p>systematic relevance (profundity)</p></li>
<li><p>intrinsic interest.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two of these criteria are inherently scientific, the third
is extrascientific.</p>
<p>The three criteria apply jointly, so that deficiency in one is
largely compensated for by excellence in the others. Take for example
the evolution of species. Neo-Darwinism is firmly accredited and highly
regarded by science, though there is little direct evidence for it,
because it beautifully fits into a mechanistic system of the universe
and bears on a subject—the origin of man—which is of the utmost
intrinsic interest. In other cases we see great accuracy of facts
compensating for comparative lack of systematic relevance or intrinsic
interest. Manne Siegbahn was awarded the Nobel prize in physics for a
greatly increased accuracy in measuring the wave length of certain X-ray
spectra, though his results revealed little that is otherwise
interesting. Yet there is a limit to the appreciation of accurate facts.
Professor T. W. Richards was awarded the Nobel prize in 1914 for a very
accurate determination of atomic weights, and his results have never
been contested. Yet in 1932 Frederick Soddy could write of this kind of
measurement that it appears now ‘of as little interest and significance
as the determination of the average weight of a collection of bottles,
some of them full and some of them more or less empty’.2 It had been
realized meanwhile that the value of atomic weights results from the
accidental proportion in which the constituent isotopes happen to be
present in the elements as found in nature. A magnitude that had seemed
to characterize a deep seated feature of the universe, had turned out to
have no such bearing. Though factually correct it had proved deceptive,
because—contrary to expectation—it did not correspond to anything
substantial in nature. When the exact atomic weight of an element ceased
to be of interest to science, what had seemed important turned out to be
trivial.</p>
<p>Though not definable in precise terms, scientific value can as a rule
be reliably assessed. Its appraisal is required and depended upon every
day in the process of advancing and disseminating science. Referees
consulted by journals have to judge whether the scientific interest of a
contribution would justify the expense of its publication. Others have
to decide whether the award of a research grant is worth while.
Scientists must be able to recognize what is manifestly trivial, just as
what is manifestly false. When the distinguished German physicist
Friedrich Kohlrausch (1840–1910) declared, in a discussion about the
aims of natural science, that he would be pleased to determine
accurately the speed of water running through the gutter,3 he was
talking nonsense. He completely misjudged the nature of scientific
value; for the accuracy of an observation does not in itself make it
valuable to science.</p>
<p>The foolish promise made by Kohlrausch was of course not his true
intention. He was merely expounding a false theory of science more
consistently than is usual; relying on it, no doubt, that—as Hume
said—the errors of philosophy are only ridiculous and its extravagances
do not influence our lives.4 But in doing so, he demonstrated
involuntarily that such absurd conclusions can be avoided—without
inconsistency—only by abandoning altogether the ideal of a strictly
objective science.</p>
<p>It is often said that science (unlike history) is concerned only with
regularities and not with unique events. This is true only up to the
point covered already by my two first criteria. An event is regular if
it is either reproducible or predictably recurrent. The reproducibility
of a fact makes its observation exceptionally reliable, while its
recurrence reveals that it forms part of a natural system. Indeed,
systematic interest can outweigh even complete absence of regularity.
Tycho Brahe’s observation in 1572 of a new fixed star of exceptional
brightness was of the greatest interest to science, for it tended to
invalidate the Aristotelian system of an unchangeable empyrean.5
Similarly, Wöhler’s synthesis of urea in 1828 weakened the traditional
belief in the uniqueness of living matter. Nor did the scientific
interest in the discovery of a living coelacanth depend on the prospect
of finding a recurrent supply of such animals, but lay in the great
systematic interest of that species as a common ancestor of all the land
vertebrates. Discoveries like these are valued for the breadth of their
implications, even though they establish no new general laws. They offer
something more vague and also more profound; namely, a truer
understanding of a large domain of experience. Generality is indeed but
an aspect of profundity in science, and profundity itself, as we shall
see, but an intimation that we are making a new, more extensive contact
with reality.</p>
<p>The difference between scientific and historical interest, moreover,
arises, not from the uniqueness of historical events but from their
interpersonal appeal, of which I shall speak later. The historical
interest of past events depends, like the scientific interest of facts,
on their bearing on a scholarly context: in this case the context of
history. Admittedly, the appeal which this context makes to the
historian is again interpersonal and thus different from the claim made
by a mathematical theory on the attention of the scientist.6</p>
<p>A great many facts are unanimously regarded by scientists as
irrelevant to science, while in respect to some they differ. Pasteur, in
his memoir on spontaneous generation, presented to the French Academy in
1860, relates how Biot and Dumas discouraged him from undertaking work
on such a subject.7 Today, only very few scientists consider it worth
while to test the facts of extra-sensory perception or of psychokinesis,
since most of them would regard this as a waste of time and an improper
use of their professional facilities. It is the normal practice of
scientists to ignore evidence which appears incompatible with the
accepted system of scientific knowledge, in the hope that it will
eventually prove false or irrelevant. The wise neglect of such evidence
prevents scientific laboratories from being plunged forever into a
turmoil of incoherent and futile efforts to verify false allegations.
But there is, unfortunately, no rule by which to avoid the risk of
occasionally disregarding thereby true evidence which conflicts (or
seems to conflict) with the current teachings of science. During the
eighteenth century the French Academy of Science stubbornly denied the
evidence for the fall of meteorites, which seemed massively obvious to
everybody else. Their opposition to the superstitious beliefs which a
popular tradition attached to such heavenly intervention blinded them to
the facts in question.8</p>
<p>As the two criteria of right perception—namely sharpness of contour
and reasonableness of the image—combine in determining what the eye will
see, so the claims of the two first criteria of scientific value, which
I have called ‘certainty’ and ‘systematic relevance’, combine in
determining the scientific value of a fact. Just as the eye sees details
that are not there if they fit in with the sense of the picture, or
overlooks them if they make no sense, so also very little inherent
certainty will suffice to secure the highest scientific value to an
alleged fact, if only it fits in with a great scientific generalization,
while the most stubborn facts will be set aside if there is no place for
them in the established framework of science.</p>
<p>There is rivalry and compensation also between the intrinsic interest
of a subject matter, which I have listed as the third variable in
determining scientific value, and the first two, i.e. accuracy and
systematic relevance. In science, as in ordinary perception, our
attention is attracted by things that are useful or dangerous to us,
even though they present themselves less distinctly and coherently. This
sets up a competition between practical and theoretical interests, with
which I shall deal more fully when defining the relation of science to
technology. But things are also interesting in themselves, and their
intrinsic interest varies greatly. Living animals are more interesting
than their dead bodies; a dog more interesting than a fly; a man more
interesting than a dog. In man himself his moral life is more
interesting than his digestion; and, again, in human society the most
interesting subjects are politics and history, which are the theatres of
great moral decisions—while, at the same time, closely interwoven with
these human concerns, there is great intrinsic interest also in the
subjects which affect man’s contemplation of the universe and his
conception of himself, his origin and destiny.</p>
<p>The subjects which are most interesting in themselves do not lend
themselves best to accurate observation and systematic study. But the
two kinds of gradings can compensate for each other over a wide range of
disciplines, in which they combine in variable proportions, and thus
uphold throughout a steady level of scientific value. The supreme
exactitude and scientific coherence of physics compensate for the
comparative dullness of its inanimate subject matter, while the
scientific value of biology is maintained at the same level as that of
physics by the greater intrinsic interest of the living things studied,
though the treatment is much less exact and coherent. The Freudian
system is perhaps not wholly accepted by science, yet its enormous
influence, based on its scientific claims, shows clearly that even a
largely conjectural and rather vague doctrine may gain great scientific
interest if it deals with man’s morality and happiness. Marxism,
equipped with only the flimsiest scientific characteristics, has become
a force of destiny, by dealing with politics in a manner claiming to be
scientific.</p>
<p>In relying for its own interest on the antecedent interest of its
subject matter, science must accept to an important extent the
pre-scientific conception of these subject matters. The existence of
animals was not discovered by zoologists, nor that of plants by
botanists, and the scientific value of zoology and botany is but an
extension of man’s pre-scientific interest in animals and plants.
Psychologists must know from ordinary experience what human intelligence
is, before they can devise tests for measuring it scientifically, and
should they measure instead something that ordinary experience does not
recognize as intelligence, they would be constructing a new subject
matter which could no longer claim the intrinsic interest attached to
that which they originally chose to study. Admittedly, the pursuits of
biology, medicine, psychology and the social sciences, may rectify our
everyday conceptions of plants and animals, and even of man and society;
but we must set against any such modification its effect on the interest
by which the study of the original subject matter had been prompted and
justified. If the scientific virtues of exact observation and strict
correlation of data are given absolute preference for the treatment of a
subject matter which disintegrates when represented in such terms, the
result will be irrelevant to the subject matter and probably of no
interest at all.9</p>
<p>The paradigm of a conception of science pursuing the ideal of
absolute detachment by representing the world in terms of its exactly
determined particulars was formulated by Laplace. An intelligence which
knew at one moment of time—wrote Laplace—’all the forces by which nature
is animated and the respective positions of the entities which compose
it, . . . would embrace in the same formula the movements of the largest
bodies in the universe and those of the lightest atom: nothing would be
uncertain for it, and the future, like the past, would be present to its
eyes.’10 Such a mind would possess a complete scientific knowledge of
the universe.11</p>
<p>This ideal of universal knowledge is mistaken, since it substitutes
for the subjects in which we are interested a set of data which tell us
nothing that we want to know. Written down mathematically, Laplacean
universal knowledge consists in the prediction of the co-ordinates p and
the impulses q of all the n atoms of the world, p(1). . . p(n); q(1). .
. q(n), at a time t, from the co-ordinates p0 and q0 (p0(1). . . p0(n) .
. . q0(1) . . . q0(n)) given at the starting time t = 0. The prediction
is made by the aid of a series of functions</p>
<p>which determines the whole set of 2n values of the p’s and the q’s at
the time t. Suppose now that we could actually observe these atomic
magnitudes at the time t. While it might be interesting to check up on
this prediction, this would merely answer a question raised by the
theory itself. It would be therefore without any interest except to the
hypothetical scientists who had computed and would subsequently observe
the p’s and q’s at the time t.</p>
<p>That such virtually meaningless information was identified by Laplace
with a knowledge of all things past and all things to come, and that the
stark absurdity of this claim has not been obvious to succeeding
generations since his day, can be accounted for only by a hidden
assumption by which this information was tacitly supplemented. It was
taken for granted that the Laplacean mind would not stop short at the
list of p’s and q’s at the time t, but proceed by virtue of its
unlimited powers of computation to evaluate from this list the events,
and indeed all the events, that we might be interested to know.</p>
<p>But this assumption is actually much larger and quite different in
character from that explicitly made by Laplace. It neither demands, nor
is it satisfied by our having an unlimited capacity for carrying out
complex computations concerning a mechanical system, but requires
instead that we should explain all kinds of experience in terms of
atomic data. This is of course the programme of a mechanistic world
view, which in modern times was first speculatively mooted by Galileo;
but this programme has never been carried out even in principle and we
shall see in Part Four that it cannot be carried out at all. The
tremendous intellectual feat conjured up by Laplace’s imagination has
diverted attention (in a manner commonly practised by conjurers) from
the decisive sleight of hand by which he substitutes a knowledge of all
experience for a knowledge of all atomic data. Once you refuse this
deceptive substitution, you immediately see that the Laplacean mind
understands precisely nothing and that whatever it knows means precisely
nothing.</p>
<p>Yet the spell of the Laplacean delusion remains unbroken to this day.
The ideal of strictly objective knowledge, paradigmatically formulated
by Laplace, continues to sustain a universal tendency to enhance the
observational accuracy and systematic precision of science, at the
expense of its bearing on its subject matter. This issue will be dealt
with systematically in Part Four by reflecting on our knowledge of
living beings. I mention it here only as an intermediate stage in a
wider intellectual disorder: namely the menace to all cultural values,
including those of science, by an acceptance of a conception of man
derived from a Laplacean ideal of knowledge and by the conduct of human
affairs in the light of such a conception.</p>
<p>Whitehead wrote that the conflicts of thought in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries were governed by the fact ’that the world had got
hold of a general idea which the world could neither live with nor live
without.’12 Scientific stringency, inflexibly resolved to denature the
vital facts of our existence, continues to sustain this conflict, which
may yet issue in a sweeping reaction against science as a perversion of
truth. This happened before, with much less justification, in the fourth
century, when St. Augustine denied the value of a natural science which
contributed nothing to the pursuit of salvation. His ban destroyed
interest in science all over Europe for a thousand years.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, the peril to the true values of science
does not lie in any overt reaction against science. It lies in the very
acceptance of a scientific outlook based on the Laplacean fallacy as a
guide to human affairs. Its reductive programme, applied to politics,
entails the idea that political action is necessarily shaped by force,
motivated by greed and fear, with morality used as a screen to delude
the victims. This materialistic view of politics can be traced—like the
mechanistic conception of man to which it is allied—far back beyond
Laplace and all the way to antiquity. But a complex historical movement
has since then led, along a number of mutually related lines, to the
establishment in our time of the scientific method as the supreme
interpreter of human affairs. This movement has created a pervasive
tension throughout our culture, similar to that generated at an earlier
time by the rebellion of reason against religion, but even more
comprehensive in its scope. Here I shall deal only with one form of this
movement and only with its effects on the appreciation of scientific
value.</p>
<p>Applied to human affairs, the Laplacean universal mechanics induces
the teaching that material welfare and the establishment of an unlimited
power for imposing the conditions of material welfare are the supreme
good. But our age overflows with inordinate moral aspirations. By
absorbing this zeal the objectives of power and wealth acquire a moral
sanctity which, added to their supposed scientific necessity, enforces
their acceptance as man’s supreme and total destiny. The comprehensive
claims of this movement leave no justification to public liberties, and
demand that all cultural activities should subserve the power of the
State in transforming society for the achievement of welfare. A
discovery will then no longer be valued by the satisfaction which it
gives to the intellectual passions of scientists, but will be assessed
according to its probable utility for strengthening public power and
improving the standard of living. Scientific value will be discredited
and its appreciation suppressed.</p>
<p>This is how a philosophic movement guided by aspirations of
scientific severity has come to threaten the position of science itself.
This self-contradiction stems from a misguided intellectual passion—a
passion for achieving absolutely impersonal knowledge which, being
unable to recognize any persons, presents us with a picture of the
universe in which we ourselves are absent. In such a universe there is
no one capable of creating and upholding scientific values; hence there
is no science.</p>
<p>The story of the Laplacean fallacy suggests a criterion of
consistency. It shows that our conceptions of man and human society must
be such as to account for man’s faculty in forming these conceptions and
to authorize the cultivation of this faculty within society. Only by
accrediting the exercise of our intellectual passions in the act of
observing man, can we form conceptions of man and society which both
endorse this accrediting and uphold the freedom of culture in society.
Such self-accrediting, or self-confirmatory, progression will prove an
effective guide to all knowledge of living beings.</p>
