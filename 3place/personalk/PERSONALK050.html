<h4 id="the-abstract-arts">12. THE ABSTRACT ARTS</h4>
<p>Our acknowledgment of intellectual passions in science will gain
support by extending our perspective to other emotions that are kindred
to it. This kinship is manifest in the most ancient achievement of
scientific theory due to Pythagoras, which derives the pleasing effect
of a succession of musical notes from the integer ratio between the
lengths of the chords struck in producing them. Sustained by this
striking fact, the Pythagorean tradition maintained for centuries a
musical appreciation of the mathematical laws controlling the celestial
order. These were extravagances; but they stemmed from the existing
kinship between different kinds of order and beauty, whether discovered
in nature, conceived in mathematics, or imaginatively created by art.
The relation is closest between pure mathematics and the abstract arts,
such as music and abstract painting.</p>
<p>Both visual and musical compositions are appreciated for the beauty
of a set of complex relations embodied in them. And as in pure
mathematics, so also in the abstract arts, these interesting
relationships are discovered, or created, within structures composed of
utterances denoting no tangible object. Among the abstract arts music
stands out by its precise and complex articulation, subject to a grammar
of its own. In profundity and scope it may compare with pure
mathematics. Moreover, both of these testify to the same paradox: namely
that man can hold important discourse about nothing. For they both speak
to us. We do not merely hear music but listen to it and enjoy it by
understanding it, even as we enjoy mathematics. Like mathematics, music
articulates a vast range of rational relationships for the mere pleasure
of understanding them.</p>
<p>Abstract painting creates pleasing visible relationships. That is why
we not merely see a canvas, but look at it and try to understand it. Its
design bears the same kinship to geometry as music does to arithmetic.
Witness the theories of cubism, or the attempts made ever since
Vitruvius, to formulate geometrical rules for the appreciation of
harmonious pictorial and architectural composition.</p>
<p>It is true that mathematics differs radically from the abstract arts
by its practice of symbolic operations; a mathematical symbol signifies
the manner in which it functions within such operations. But while the
elementary utterances of abstract art can have no such meaning, they can
rely instead on their sensuous content. A patch of colour, a musical
note are so substantial in themselves, that they can speak their part in
articulating a relationship with other patches of colour, or other
musical notes, without pointing beyond themselves. Instead of denoting
something—whether an external object or their own use—they emphatically
present their own striking sensuous presence.</p>
<p>The decisive part which intellectual passions have been shown to play
in the several domains of natural science, engineering, and mathematics,
demonstrates the ubiquity of such participation. In each of these
domains it is the relevant intellectual passion which affirms the
distinctive intellectual values by which any particular performance may
qualify for admittance to the domain. The arts appear then no longer as
contrasted but as immediately continuous with science, only that in them
the thinker participates more deeply in the object of his thought.</p>
<p>The emotional life engendered by an articulate culture is, of course,
primordially rooted in the emotions of inarticulate creatures. We have
seen that the exhilaration shown by apes and babies when solving a
problem prefigures the intellectual joys of science. A game of chess
creates its own pleasures, but could not do so if babies could not play
with rattles; though a joke is not an expression of hilarity, it can
create hilarity because men can laugh. Laments for the dead and songs of
love are likewise formulations of earlier shapeless emotions, which are
refashioned and amplified into something new by words and music. The
originally experienced sentiments are not expressed but alluded to, just
as objects are alluded to rather than represented in a painting. Such
allusions may be as remote as the allusions to the existence of solids
in the theory of numbers, or as close as the allusion to observed
crystals in geometrical crystallography; and all art lies between two
limits of this kind. However abstract, it will echo some experience, and
would be as meaningless to someone lacking any such experience, as
arithmetic would be to a person living in a gaseous universe. And again,
however meticulously descriptive and plainly expressive a work of art
may be, it must never come any closer in referring to experience than
crystallography does to crystals; no closer than a representation of a
conceivable experience, framed in its own harmonious terms, can come to
actual experience. Precise statements of fact or exact expressions of
sentiment contained in a work of art tend to flatten it out to a map, a
report or a personal communication.83</p>
<p>An intelligence which dwells wholly within an articulate structure of
its own creation accentuates by doing so a paradox that is inherent in
the exercise of all intellectual passions. The practice of the visual
and musical arts which releases, formulates and disciplines our
faculties for harmonious experience, exerts to the utmost the artist’s
powers of invention and discrimination merely for the purpose of
satisfying the standards of appreciation which the artist has set for
himself. A symphony is obviously something new achieved by the human
mind; but in calling it a symphony its composer demands recognition for
it as something inherently excellent. The natural scientist and the
engineer are not so free to satisfy themselves; no scientific theory is
beautiful if it is false and no invention is truly ingenious if it is
impracticable. Yet this merely modifies the conditions of a process of
self-satisfaction. The standards of scientific value and of inventive
ingenuity must still be satisfied, and these standards are set by the
scientist’s and the engineer’s own intellectual passions.</p>
<p>To this extent, then, whether thought operates indwellingly within a
universe of its own creation, or interprets and controls nature as given
to it from outside, the same paradoxical structure prevails throughout
the articulate systems so far surveyed. There is present a personal
component, inarticulate and passionate, which declares our standards of
values, drives us to fulfil them and judges our performance by these
self-set standards.</p>
