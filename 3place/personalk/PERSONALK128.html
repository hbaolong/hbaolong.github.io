<li><p>Isolated facts are of course devoid of scientific significance,
just as an isolated event of the past is devoid of historical
significance; but this is a tautology, since the isolated character of a
fact is logically incompatible with its having an important hearing on
the outlook of the scientist or the historian. My point is that
uniqueness does not entail isolation.</p></li>

Generation, Harvard Case Histories in Experimental Science, No. 7,

<li><p>‘Scientists in other countries were anxious not to be considered
as backward compared with their famous colleagues in Paris’, writes F.
Paneth (‘Science and Miracles’, Durham University Journal, 10 (1948–9),
p. 49). ‘. . . many public museums threw away whatever they possessed of
these precious meteorites; it happened in Germany, Denmark, Switzerland,
Italy and Austria.’</p></li>
<li><p>See R. B. Perry, Realms of Value, Cambridge, Mass., 1954, p. 357:
‘If as in the case of sociology the subject matter does not permit of
exactness and conclusiveness then it does not suffice to be exact and
conclusive about some other subject matter.’</p></li>

<li><p>Though quantum mechanics modifies the terms in which the
Laplacean mind operates it does not effectively reduce its scope. The
time-dependent wave-equation of the world determines for all times the
wave-equation of the world, which, in quantum mechanics, represents our
ultimate knowledge of all the particles in the world. It fixes the
statistical distribution of all possible observables throughout the
world, leaving open within this framework only variations which are
strictly random.</p></li>
<li><p>A. N. Whitehead, Science and the Modern World, Cambridge, 1926,
p. 63.</p></li>
<li><p>See p. 7 above.</p></li>
<li><p>I have quoted previously (in The Logic of Liberty, Chicago and
London, 1951, p. 17) a table of figures published in Nature (146 (1940),
p. 620) purporting to show that the days of gestation of different
rodents is an integer multiple of the number π, and have said that no
amount of such evidence would convince us today that this relationship
is real. Number rules to which no scientist will pay attention are
frequently put forward today by the adherents of occult
sciences.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the predominant view today; it is contradicted by D.
Bohm, Quantum Theory, New York, 1951.</p></li>
<li><p>The distinction between incompetence and error is of great
importance in the administration of scientific research. The following
directions to referees of the Royal Society make this plain: ‘A paper
should not be recommended for rejection” (it says) ‘merely because the
referee disagrees with the opinions or conclusions it contains, unless
fallacious reasoning or experimental error is unmistakably
evident.’</p></li>
<li><p>See G. Abetti, History of Astronomy, London, 1954, p. 73. A. C.
Crombie, Augustine to Galileo, London, 1952, p. 60–1, describes the use
of similar distinctions in the controversies about Aristotelean (or
physical) and Ptolemaic (or mathematical) astronomy in the Middle Ages.
Thus the statement of St. Thomas, Summa Theologica, Part 1, ques. 32,
provides the background for Osiander’s type of argument: ‘For anything a
system may be induced in a double fashion. One way is for proving some
principle as in natural science where sufficient reason can be brought
to show that the motions of the heavens are always of uniform velocity.
In the other way, reasons may be adduced which do not sufficiently prove
the principle, but which may show that the effects which follow agree
with that principle, as in astronomy a system of eccentrics and
epicycles is posited because this assumption enables the sensible
phenomena of the celestial motions to be accounted for. But this is not
a sufficient proof; because possibly another hypothesis might also be
able to account for them.’ This conventionalist theory of science,
current in the late Middle Ages, was meant to deny science access to
reality; consequently its wording coincides with the positivist analysis
of science which seeks to purify it from metaphysics by avoiding any
reference to reality. So, as Crombie points out (‘Galilée devant les
Critiques de la Posterité’, University of Paris, 1956, p. 10), Duhem
could say ‘that it was Bellarmin and Osiander, and not Galileo and
Kepler, who had grasped the precise significance of the experimental
method’.</p></li>
<li><p>G. Abetti, op. cit., p. 74.</p></li>
<li><p>Sir Edmund Whittaker (‘Obituary Notice on Einstein’, Biogr. Mem.
Roy. Soc., 1955, p. 48) points out that, contrary to widespread opinion,
the physićal significance of Copernicanism is not impaired by
relativity. For the Copernican axes are inertial, while the Ptolemaic
are not, and the earth rotates with respect to the local inertial
axes.</p></li>
<li><p>G. de Santillana, The Crime of Galileo, Chicago, 1955, p. 164
n. ‘On Wolynski’s count, there were 2,330 works published on astronomy
between 1543 and 1887 . . . , of those, only 180 were Copernican (see
Archivo Storico Italiano, 1873, p. 12).’</p></li>
<li><p>This account, based on my own recollection of the events in
question, has been substantially confirmed by Louis de Broglie, Le
Dualisme des Ondes et des Corpuscules dans L’Œuvre de Albert Einstein,
Institut de France, Academie des Sciences, 1955, p. 16–17. De Broglie
adds that his work would presumably have remained unknown for a long
time without Einstein’s subsequent reference to it in a paper published
in 1925 (ibid., p. 18). The only surviving examiner, Charles Mauguin,
reports that while he recognized the originality and depth of thought of
the candidate, ‘when the thesis was presented I did not believe in the
physical reality of the waves associated with the particles of matter. I
saw in them rather pure creations of the mind. . . . Only after the
experiments of Davisson and Germer (1927), of G. P. Thomson (1928) and
only when I held in my hand the beautiful photographs (Electron
diffraction patterns from thin layers of ZnO), which Ponte had succeeded
in making in the École Normale, did I understand how inconsistent,
ridiculous and nonsensical my attitude was’ (Louis de Broglie und die
Physiker, German edition of Louis de Broglie: Physicien et Penseur,
Hamburg, 1955, p. 192).</p></li>
<li><p>W. Elsasser, Die Naturwissenschaften 13 (1925), p. 711. Davisson
and Germer’s first observations of electron diffraction go back to 1925
but their interpretation of their observations as electron diffraction
and the publication of this result followed only two years later, in
1927.</p></li>
<li><p>Galileo never made use of this argument, which was the strongest
available to him. He seems never to have accepted Kepler’s elliptical
planetary paths, presumably because his Pythagoreanism was even more
rigid than Kepler’s. (See G. de Santillana, op. cit., pp. 106 (note 29)
and 168–70).</p></li>
<li><p>Admittedly, the phases of Venus discovered by Galileo could not
be accounted for by the Ptolemaic system, but they were compatible with
Tycho Brahe’s assumption that the planets circled round the Sun which
itself circled round the Earth. Fortunately, no experiment of the
Michelson Morley type was carried out at the time, for its negative
result would have served as decisive proof that the Earth was at
rest.</p></li>
<li><p>Sec Goethe, Geschichte der Farbenlehre, Vierte Abteilung, 2te
Zwischenbemerkung: ‘Vielleicht ist nie eine grössere Forderung an die
Menschheit geschehen: denn was ging nicht alles durch diese Anerkennung
in Dunst und Rauch auf: ein zweites Paradies, eine Welt der Unschuld,
Dichtkunst und Frömmigkeit, das Zeugnis der Sinne, die Überzeugung eines
poetisch-religiösen Glaubens; kein Wunder, dass man dies alles nicht
wollte fahren lassen, dass man sich auf alle Weise einer solchen Lehre
entgegensetzte, die denjenigen, der sie annahm, zu einer bisher
unbekannten, ja ungeahneten Denkfreiheit und Grossheit der Gesinnungen
berechtigte und aufforderte.’</p></li>
<li><p>See R. A. Fisher, Creative Aspects of Natural Law, Eddington
Memorial Lecture, Cambridge, 1950, p. 15: ‘We attempt, so far as our
powers allow, to understand the world, by reasoning, by experimentation,
and again by reasoning. In this process moral or emotional grounds for
preferring one conclusion to another are completely out of
place.’</p></li>
<li><p>Hegel, Dissertatio philosophies de Orbitis Planetarum (1801),
Werke, Berlin, 1834, 16, p. 28. In his lectures on the Philosophy of
Nature, Hegel admitted the presence of Ceres and other asteroids in this
gap. He still referred to the numbers of the Timaeus, but he now
declared that the law of the planetary distances was still unknown, and
that one day the scientists would have to turn to the philosophers to
find it. Bertrand Beaumont, in discussing Hegel’s position (Mind, N.S.,
63, 1954, pp. 246–8), suggests that the Platonic series could be
extended beyond the original seven; but in terms of Greek mathematics
this is impossible.</p></li>

<li><p>An attempt to interpret Bode’s Law rationally by deriving it from
a theory of the planetary system was made by C. F. von Weizsäcker in
1943 (Zs. für Astrophysik, 22 (1944), p. 319). But from a later paper it
appears that the problem is still in flux (see C. F. von Weizsäcker,
Festschrift der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Göttingen, 1951,
p. 120).</p></li>
<li><p>Naturphilosophie lingered on longest in botany, where eminent
scientists were ranged on both sides, with Braun and Agassiz standing
largely under the influence of Goethe’s morphology and of the nature
philosophy of Schelling, opposed from the middle of the nineteenth
century onward by others, notably Schleiden and Hofmeister, who
developed the science of plant morphology on an experimental basis. See
K. v. Goebel, Wilhelm Hofmeister, London, 1926. We shall see in Part
Four that this controversy is still not completely closed
today.</p></li>

acknowledged until recently in the Soviet Union as proofs of the
spontaneous generation of cellular organisms were carried out by
Lepeshinskaia (see Th. Dobzhansky, Proceedings of Hamburg Congress on

<li><p>R. J. Dubos, op. cit., p. 128. J. B. Conant (Pasteur’s and
Tyndall’s Study of Spontaneous Generation, Harvard Univ. Press, 1953)
suggests (p. 15) that the most convincing evidence for the impossibility
of spontaneous generation is to be found ‘in the whole fabric of the
results of the study of pure bacterial cultures in the last sixty or
seventy years’. The author implies that all the experiments made to
decide this question, from the inception of Spallanzani’s studies in
1768 up to 1880–90, could be interpreted in terms of either of the
opposing systems of thought.</p></li>
<li><p>I have illustrated before how an apposite new conception can
reconcile two alternative systems of interpretation which hitherto
violently opposed each other. Braid’s conception of ‘hypnosis’
acknowledged the reality of the very features of Mesmerism hitherto
taken to prove its fraudulence, while rejecting the evidence for ‘animal
magnetism’ which had been advanced as its claim to scientific solidity.

Riezler. The authors extended Eddington’s argument to the farcical
conclusion that the value of –273° C. for the temperature at absolute
zero was an integer.</p></li>

<li><p>Up to 90 per cent of the subjects may predict that the hitherto
non-preponderant alternative will appear next (J. Cohen and C. E. M.
Hansel, Risk and Gambling, London, New York, Toronto, 1956,
pp. 10–36).</p></li>
<li><p>Oskar Pfungst, Das Pferd des Herrn von Osten (Der kluge Hans),

<li><p>Morris R. Cohen concludes a critique of the traditional ‘canons
of induction’ by saying: ‘If the true cause is not included in our major
premise the “canons of induction” will not enable us to discover it. If
anyone thinks that I have understated the case for these canons of
induction as methods of discovery, let him discover by their means the
cause of cancer or of disorders of internal secretion’ (A Preface to
Logic, London and New York, 1944, p. 21).</p></li>
<li><p>There is a variant to the Clever Hans fallacy in what may be
called the illusion of ‘You can’t miss it’. Persons very familiar with a
district are the worst at giving directions to a stranger. They tell you
‘just to keep going straight on’, forgetting the forks at which you will
have to decide which way to go. They cannot realize that their
indications are altogether ambiguous, because to them they are not. So
they say confidently, ‘You can’t miss it’.</p></li>
<li><p>‘Material advantages’ should exclude inter alia the achievement
of symbolic expression or of human interactions. Thus the construction
of churches and prisons or the manufacture of handcuffs are tasks of
technology, but the ultimate uses of these objects are not part of
technology. The word ‘implement’ is meant to designate all three classes
of useful things: materials, devices and processes. Action according to
‘specifiable rules’ excludes artistic performances.</p></li>
<li><p>Operational principles will be taken to include here the
constructional principles which tell us the way technical devices, like
machines or houses, are to be built.</p></li>
<li><p>The law could try to grant a monopoly for the future practical
applications of a new discovery; but no patent law does this, for it is
impracticable. The law endorses thereby once more the sharp distinction
between a knowledge of the facts of nature (achieved by discovery) and
the knowledge of an operational principle (achieved by
invention).</p></li>
<li><p>J. R. Oppenheimer, ‘Functions of the International Agency in
Research and Development’, Atomic Scientific Bulletin, 1947, p. 173. See
also V. B. Wigglesworth, ‘The Contribution of Pure Science to Applied
Biology’, The Annals of Applied Biology, 42 (1955), pp. 34–44. Speaking
of pure scientists working on practical war-time problems, Wigglesworth
writes: ‘In the pure science to which they were accustomed, if they were
unable to solve problem A they could turn to problem B, and while
studying this with perhaps small prospect of success they might suddenly
come across a clue to the solution of problem C. But now they must find
a solution to problem A, and problem A alone, and there was no escape.
Furthermore, there proved to be tiresome and unexpected rules which made
the game unnecessarily difficult: some solutions were barred because
there was not enough of the raw material available: others were barred
because the materials required were too costly; and yet others were
excluded because they might constitute a danger to human life or health.
In short, they made the discovery that applied biology is not “biology
for the less intelligent”, it is a totally different subject requiring a
totally different attitude of mind’ (p. 34).</p></li>
<li><p>On the range of undisclosed knowledge buried in empirical
technology, see p. 52 above.</p></li>
<li><p>In the address by Wigglesworth just, cited (p. 178, n. 1), the
author describes the varying relationships which obtain between pure and
applied science in the biological field. These two ‘totally different
subjects’ may contribute to each other’s good in a number of ways. E.g.
for the pure scientist ‘one of the most efficient correctives to the
dangers of over-specialization is provided by the stimulus of contact
with practice’ (p. 36). On the other hand, applied biology may turn to
pure science for the systematic explanation of its practical discoveries
(p. 38); and of course the applied biologist ‘in thinking about any
practical problem . . . is continually making use of the whole range of
scientific knowledge that exists about all its component parts’ (p. 40).
Yet the authorities are warned that this mutual advantage depends in the
last analysis on the independence of pure biology from the narrower
demands of the applied subject: ‘. . . the D.S.I.R. . . . makes grants
for any research proposals which are of exceptional “timeliness and
promise”. The difficulty is that the most original ideas are at the
outset both unpromising and untimely. Only research which is totally
unfettered can advance into the most unpromising fields. . . . I very
much doubt whether it would have been reasonable for the A.R.C. to have
supported, for example, Darwin’s experiments on the curving of bean
shoots or the early experiments of the Wents on the growth of the oat
coleoptile—because no one could have foreseen the impact that these
observations were going to have on the agriculture of the future. . . .
But at least the Research Councils should take great care not to impede
the advance of pure science. . . . Knowledge is a delicate plant, and .
. . it is an undesirable practice to keep pulling plants up to see how
the roots are getting on’ (pp. 42–3).</p></li>

fact that Lalande would have discovered Neptune in 1795 if only he had
believed what he saw on the 8th and 10th of May in that year. ‘But had
he done so, how lamentable would have been the loss to science. The
discovery of Neptune would then merely have been an accidental reward to
a laborious worker, instead of being one of the most glorious
achievements in the loftiest department of human reason’ (Sir R. S.
Ball, The Story of the Heavens, London, 1891, p. 288).</p></li>

<li><p>See T. Dobzhansky, ‘The Fate of Biological Science in Russia’,
Proceedings of the Hamburg Congress on Science and Freedom, London,
1955, p. 216. The attempt to define science in terms of its practical
success has already been shown to be logically untenable (see p. 169
above).</p></li>
<li><p>Some parallels from remoter fields may throw light on the
principle involved here. Suppose it were decided by psychiatrists that a
general increase in psychoneurotic ailments could only be checked by a
restoration of religious faith; this would not make us all believe in
God. In fact no ulterior advantage can make us believe in God, while if
we do believe in God no consequent disadvantage can make us lose our
faith. Or suppose that the people of the United States came clearly to
the conclusion from a study of British experience that they would live
together more intimately if their common affections were attached to a
King and a Royal Family. This would not in itself produce such
affections, or establish a monarchy in the U.S. No genuine affections
can ever be produced by ulterior motives; they must discover and uphold
their satisfaction in themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember in this connection that mathematical exercises in
problem-solving are of two types, one of which (‘prove that . . .’) is a
contriving, as in technology, while the other (‘find an X such that . .
.’) is a discovering, as in science.</p></li>
<li><p>The scruple in question was raised already by Leibniz and was
eliminated only by the addition of a new axiom by Dedekind (1872) to
those of Euclid (Weyl, op. cit., p. 40). The process of successive
conceptual development and accompanying increase of rigour has been
meticulously traced by Daval and Guilbaud in Le Raisonnement
Mathématique (Presses Universitaires de France, 1945), for the series of
creative acts leading up to Bolzano’s theorem. The starting point lay in
the elementary process of successive,, approximation by which we can
determine to any degree of accuracy the solution of an equation such as
x3 = 4. This method was known by the end of the sixteenth century. But
since no approximation gave the solution, this method left open a
problem—a problem which became clearer through the generalization and
geometric expression of the equation. If the equation y3 = 4, or more
generally, f(x) = c, is expressed in the form:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>y = f(x)</p>
<p>y = c,</p>
<p>the solution will lie at the intersection of the curve y = f(x) and
the line y = c. But what guarantees that the two will meet? Cauchy, in
1821, proved the theorem (since called Bolzano’s): if f(x) is continuous
in the interval x = a, x = b, and if c is a number lying between f(a)
and f(b), the equation f(x) = c has always at least one solution in the
interval (a, b). But what is meant by ’continuity”? With the help of the
conception of convergence, Cauchy defined continuity: a function (x) is
continuous at point a if</p>
<p>Thus the all-important idea of continuity came to light, say Daval
and Guilbaud, ‘grâce à un regard jeté sure une opération mentale déjà
effectuée, mais qui se cristallise du fait que l’esprit regarde ce qu’il
a fait au lieu de continuer à faire’ (p. 117).</p>

the memoir which the Academy had rejected. It signifies a total
transformation of higher algebra, projecting a full light on what had

different branches of science’.</p></li>

more than those of geometry. (See I. A. Richards, Science and Poetry,

of obscure hints in a work of art may help us to enjoy it: Picasso’s
visual explanation of one of his cubistic pictures in the Museum of
Modern Art in New York guides the viewer’s eye to a better understanding
of it. On the other hand, A. E. Housman, in The Name and Nature of
Poetry (Cambridge, 1933), demonstrates the disastrous effects of tracing
the precise meaning of the symbolism in Poe’s ‘Haunted Palace’. Some of
my favourite poems gave me more genuine pleasure as a child, when I did
not understand them.</p></li>

<p>On allusiveness in architecture, see Geoffrey Scott, The Architecture
of Humanism, 2nd edn., New York, 1954, p. 95: ‘Architecture . . . is an
art of spaces and of solids, a felt relation between ponderable things,
an adjustment to one another of evident forces, a grouping of material
bodies subject like ourselves to certain elementary laws. Weight and
resistance, burden and effort, weakness and power, are elements in our
own experience, and inseparable in that experience from feelings of
ease, exultation, or distress. But weight and resistance, weakness and
power, are manifest elements also in architecture, which enacts through
their means a kind of human drama. Through them the mechanical solutions
of mechanical problems achieve an aesthetic interest and an ideal
value.’</p>
