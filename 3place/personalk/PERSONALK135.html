<li><p>See R. A. Fisher, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection,
Oxford, 1930; J. Huxley, Evolution: The Modern Synthesis, London, 1942;
G. G. Simpson, The Major Features of Evolution, New York, 1953.
Replacement by better equipped variants is said frequently to take place
by the migration of the new type into areas not accessible to the
original type, so that the latter remains in undisturbed possession of
its dwelling place.</p></li>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>Throughout the process of morphogenesis the chromosomes are
reproduced at each successive cell division and thereby place a replica
of themselves into every cell of the final organism. But the successive
differentiations achieved in these consecutive cell divisions become
ever more specialized. This progressive differentiation appears
therefore unaffected by the chromosomes present in the cells in
question; it is in fact determined instead by the ‘morphogenetic field’,
(b) Regeneration, which in the lower animals can reproduce whole organs,
including the head of the animal, proceeds likewise under control of a
morphogenetic field, while duplicating a set of chromosomes which cannot
be seen to exercise any effect on this morphogenetic process. (c)
Specialized tissues continue to proliferate in cultures, while
duplicating again at each cell division sets of chromosomes which should
reproduce the whole organism.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>How can the duplication of the same chromosomes produce the most
varied types of cells? If the chromosomes do not control the nature of
the cells produced in the course of morphogenesis, what agent does
exercise this control? And how can the chromosomes still be said to
control morphogenesis as a whole? There is some fundamental principle
missing here. Perhaps it will be supplied by accepting the morphogenetic
field as the true ordering principle of ontogenesis. Of this more
later.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>This goes back to Reiner and Spiegelman, J. Phys. Chem., 49
(1945), 81 and to Prigogine and Wiame, Experientia, 2 (1946),
451.</p></li>
<li><p>Part One, ch. 3, p. 39.</p></li>
<li><p>Huxley, Hardy, Ford, Evolution as a Process, London, 1954,
p. 91.</p></li>
<li><p>For a vivid description of this pursuit see H. S. Jennings,
Behavior of the Lower Organisms, New York, 1906, p. 15.</p></li>
<li><p>Teilhard de Chardin, Le Phénomène Humain, Paris, 1955,
p. 200.</p></li>
<li><p>Let me repeat that, contrary to a widespread opinion, the change
from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics makes no difference to
this argument. The behaviour of human beings whose particles were ruled
by the equations of quantum mechanics would be completely predetermined
by these, except for a certain range of random variations which would be
strictly unaccountable. Since human judgment is anything but a strictly
unaccountable random choice, a quantum mechanical automaton is no better
a representation of intelligent behaviour than a mechanical automaton
would be; and it offers no possibility either for the presence of human
consciousness.</p></li>
<li><p>This analysis of randomness is required here also, to show that
randomness is in fact (as I have said before in Part One, ch. 3, p. 38)
the ultimate, not further analysable, condition for the applicability of
the calculus of probability. This view has been emphatically stated
before by N. C. Campbell, Physics, The Elements, Cambridge, 1920,
e.g. on p. 207: ‘I urge that we must accept the conception of a random
distribution as fundamental to all the study of chance and probability;
we are prepared to accept the statement that some distribution is random
as an ultimate statement and as one that requires no explanation. All
chance events are to be explained in terms of random distributions and
when we have so explained them there is nothing more to be
said.’</p></li>
<li><p>See e.g. I. J. Good, Probability and the Weighing of Evidence,
London, 1950, p. 15.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose the overall condition (temperature and the pressure of a
gas is compatible with n different microscopic states and the
probabilities of these are W1 W2. . . Wn ( Wn = 1). The entropy (S) of
the gas is then S = −k Wn ln Wn (k = Boltzman’s constant) and S will
always be a finite positive magnitude. We note further that if any W is
0 or 1 the corresponding term drops out.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose now that we know the molecular particulars of the gas; we
know then in which microscopic state it is to be found. Consequently,
the value of W for this state is 1, while W for all other states is 0.
It follows that S = 0, i.e. the specification of its molecular
particulars has wiped out the entropy of the gas. Since both the
temperature and the pressure of a gas depend on its entropy, this result
corroborates the statement made in the text.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>G. Spencer Brown suggests that randomization might always be
incomplete and tries to explain Rhine’s results on these grounds (G.
Spencer Brown, Nature, 72 (1953), pp. 154, 594).</p></li>
<li><p>Hilda Geiringer, ‘On the Statistical Investigation of
Transcendental Numbers’, in Studies in Mathematics and Mechanics
presented to Richard von Mises, Academic Press, New York, 1954,
p. 310.</p></li>
<li><p>Niels Bohr in his Faraday Lecture (J. Chem. Soc., 1932, Pt. I,
pp. 349 ff.) expressed the view that the relation between the
macroscopic and microscopic description of a gas is an instance of
complementarity in the sense established in quantum mechanics between
the position and velocity of an electron. This theory supports the
unspecifiable character of randomness, but otherwise it is not
acceptable. I want to show this here in some detail, for this argument
will reveal my dissent from yet another widely held opinion of great
importance. In quantum mechanics any attempt at specifying the position
and velocity of an electron must be defined in terms of the electron’s
interaction with a definite measuring instrument. The result will depend
on the instrument chosen and will again be a statement of probability.
The more narrowly our measurement defines the position of a particle the
more widely does it leave its velocity undetermined and the product of
the two ranges is constant. The complementarity of these two ranges of
knowledge differs however from the two alternative kinds of knowledge
that we can have of a pack of cards, or of the sequence of digits in the
number π. For the same pack of cards could be well shuffled for one man
and perfectly stacked for another; and though one man can use the digits
of the number π as a random sequence, another may compute them with
perfect assurance. This is not so for the probable positions and
velocities of an electron. There is nothing present in this case that is
hidden to one observer and known to another. In fact, the outcome of the
observation does not depend here on the participation of the observer,
but on the action of a measuring instrument, the result being the same
for any observer. This contradicts on the one hand the view that the
relation between the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of an
atomistic system is an instance of complementarity; and it shows also on
the other hand that (contrary to a widespread opinion) the indeterminacy
principle of quantum mechanics establishes no effect of the observer on
the observed object. The supposed effect vanishes if we include the
‘measuring instrument’ in the ‘observed object’. The latter becomes then
‘the observed phenomenon’ in the sense now accepted by Bohr’s school of
interpretation. (See L. Rosenfeld, ‘The Strife about Complementarity’
(Science Progress, No. 163, July, 1953, p. 395).</p></li>
<li><p>See p. 338n. above.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be important to distinguish here between action and
decision. The action of mechanical forces transforms potential into
kinetic energy, and the action of biotic fields may be regarded as
analogous to this. But mechanical effects can be produced without force,
merely by selection, as in the case of a Maxwellian demon which can
compress a gas indefinitely by effortlessly moving to and fro a
frictionless, perfectly balanced shutter. This offers a possibility for
conceiving the action of the mind on the body as exercising no force and
transferring no energy of its own. Indeed, since it is the peculiar
function of the mind to exercise discrimination, it may not even appear
too far-fetched that the mind should exercise power over the body merely
by sorting out the random impulses of the ambient thermal agitation. We
may bear this possibility in mind whenever referring to autonomous
centres of decision.</p></li>
<li><p>To this extent the suggestion that the faculty of acquiring
knowledge originated in the selective advantage offered by it appears
tautologous; you obviously cannot explain the origin of life by the
survival of living beings. Admittedly, the cognitive faculty may be
developed further by its selective advantage; but since this does not
explain how it works, neither can it be said to explain its
origin.</p></li>
