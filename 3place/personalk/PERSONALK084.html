<h4 id="is-doubt-a-heuristic-principle">5. IS DOUBT A HEURISTIC
PRINCIPLE?</h4>
<p>We have seen that the practice of scientific scepticism in respect to
allegations rejected by science consists in upholding the current
scientific view of their subject matter, and we have seen this kind of
scepticism also directed against fellow scientists in a fundamental
controversy within science. But is there not a kind of rebellious
scientific achievement which requires the power to doubt hitherto
accepted beliefs of science? To be sure, every scientific discovery is
conservative in the sense that it maintains and expands science as a
whole, and to this extent confirms the scientific view of the world and
strengthens its hold on our minds; but no major discovery can fail also
to modify the outlook of science, and some have changed it profoundly. A
number of revolutionary discoveries, like those of the heliocentric
system, of genes, of quanta, of radioactivity or of relativity, come
readily to mind. Might it not be that the process of assimilating fresh
topics to the existing system merely conserves science, while true
innovations include a revolutionary change by which the whole framework
of science is reformed?</p>
<p>This sounds plausible, but it is not true. The power to expand
hitherto accepted beliefs far beyond the scope of hitherto explored
implications is itself a pre-eminent force of change in science. It is
this kind of force which sent Columbus in search of the Indies across
the Atlantic. His genius lay in taking it literally and as a guide to
practical action that the earth was round, which his contemporaries held
vaguely and as a mere matter for speculation. The ideas which Newton
elaborated in his Principia were also widely current in his time; his
work did not shock any strong beliefs held by scientists, at any rate in
his own country. But again, his genius was manifested in his power of
casting these vaguely held beliefs into a concrete and binding form. One
of the greatest and most surprising discoveries of our own age, that of
the diffraction of X-rays by crystals (in 1912) was made by a
mathematician, Max von Laue, by the sheer power of believing more
concretely than anyone else in the accepted theory of crystals and
X-rays. These advances were no less bold and hazardous than were the
innovations of Copernicus, Planck or Einstein.</p>
<p>There exists, accordingly, no valid heuristic maxim in natural
science which would recommend either belief or doubt as a path to
discovery. Some discoveries are prompted by the conviction that
something is fundamentally lacking in the existing framework of science,
others by the opposite feeling that there is far more implied in it than
has yet been realized. The first conviction may be regarded as more
sceptical than the second, but it is precisely the first which is more
likely to be hampered by doubt—owing to excessive adherence to the
existing orthodoxy of science.</p>
<p>Besides, as there is no rule to tell us at the moment of deciding on
the next step in research what is truly bold and what merely reckless,
there is none either for distinguishing between doubt which will curb
recklessness and thus qualify as true caution, and doubt which cripples
boldness and will stand condemned as unimaginative dogmatism. Vesalius
is praised as a hero of scientific scepticism for boldly rejecting the
traditional doctrine that the dividing wall of the heart was pierced by
invisible passages; but Harvey is acclaimed for the very opposite
reason, namely for boldly assuming the presence of invisible passages
connecting the arteries with the veins.</p>
