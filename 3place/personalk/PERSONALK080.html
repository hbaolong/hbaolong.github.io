<h4 id="the-doctrine-of-doubt">1. THE DOCTRINE OF DOUBT</h4>
<p>MY resolve to make philosophy the declaration of my ultimate beliefs
will have yet to be stated systemically. But we must first get rid of a
prejudice which otherwise will undermine the morale of our whole
enterprise.</p>
<p>It has been taken for granted throughout the critical period of
philosophy that the acceptance of unproven beliefs was the broad road to
darkness, while truth was approached by the straight and narrow path of
doubt. We were warned that a host of unproven beliefs were instilled in
us from earliest childhood. That religious dogma, the authority of the
ancients, the teaching of the schools, the maxims of the nursery, all
were united to a body of tradition which we tended to accept merely
because these beliefs had been previously held by others, who wanted us
to embrace them in our turn. We were urged to resist the pressure of
this traditional indoctrination by pitting against it the principle of
philosophic doubt. Descartes had declared that universal doubt should
purge his mind of all opinions held merely on trust and open it to
knowledge firmly grounded in reason. In its stricter formulations the
principle of doubt forbids us altogether to indulge in any desire to
believe and demands that we should keep our minds empty, rather than
allow any but irrefutable beliefs to take possession of them. Kant said
that in mathematics there was no room for mere opinion, but only for
real knowledge, and that short of possessing knowledge we must refrain
here from all judgment.1</p>
<p>The method of doubt is a logical corollary of objectivism. It trusts
that the uprooting of all voluntary components of belief will leave
behind unassailed a residue of knowledge that is completely determined
by the objective evidence. Critical thought trusted this method
unconditionally for avoiding error and establishing truth.</p>
<p>I do not say that during the period of critical thought this method
has been always, or indeed ever, rigorously practised—which I believe to
be impossible—but merely that its practice has been avowed and emphatic,
while its relaxation was marginal and acknowledged only in passing.
Admittedly, Hume was fairly frank in this respect; he openly chose to
brush aside the conclusions of his own scepticism at those points where
he did not think he could honestly follow them. Even so he failed to
acknowledge that by so doing he was expressing his own personal beliefs;
nor did he claim his right and accept his duty to declare such beliefs,
when this amounted to the silencing of doubt and the abandonment of
strict objectivity. His dissent from scepticism was strictly unofficial,
forming no explicit part of his philosophy. Kant, however, took this
contradiction seriously. He rallied to a superhuman effort to meet the
situation exposed by Hume’s critique of knowledge, without admitting any
relaxation of doubt. ‘The root of these disturbances’, he wrote in
respect of such difficulties,</p>
<p>which lies deep in the nature of human reason, must be removed. But
how can we do so, unless we give it freedom, nay, nourishment, to send
out shoots so that it may discover itself to our eyes, and that it may
then be entirely destroyed? We must, therefore, bethink ourselves of
objections which have never yet occurred to any opponent, and indeed
lend him our weapons, and grant him the most favourable position which
he could possibly desire. We have nothing to fear, but much to hope for;
namely, that we may gain for ourselves a possession which can never
again be contested.2</p>
<p>Kant’s hopes of an incontestable estate of reason has long since
proved too high; but the fervour of doubting was transmitted up to our
day. Popular thought in the nineteenth century was dominated by writers
who, with an eye on the natural sciences, declared with complete
assurance that they accepted no belief whatever that had not passed the
test of unrestricted doubt. As a distinguished example for a thousand
lesser ones, take this eloquent declaration of the principle of doubt by
J. S. Mill:</p>
<p>The beliefs which we have most warrant for have no safeguard to rest
on, but a standing invitation to the whole world to prove them
unfounded. If the challenge is not accepted, or is accepted and the
attempt fails, we are far enough from certainty still; but we have done
the best that the existing state of human reason admits of; we have
neglected nothing that could give the truth a chance of reaching us; if
the lists are open, we may hope that if there be a better truth, it will
be found when the human mind is capable of receiving it; and in the
meantime we may rely on having attained such approach to truth as is
possible in our own day. This is the amount of certainty attainable by a
fallible being, and this the sole way of attaining it.3</p>
<p>No proclamation of intellectual integrity could be more sincere; yet
its words are devoid of any definite meaning, and their ambiguity
conceals precisely the kind of personal convictions which they so loudly
repudiate. For we know that J. S. Mill and other writers standing in the
Liberal tradition of philosophic doubt held—and hold today—a wide range
of beliefs in science, ethics, politics, etc., which are by no means
unquestioned. If they regard these as not having been ‘proved
unfounded’, this merely reflects their decision to reject the arguments
which are or were advanced against them. At no time could the beliefs of
Liberalism be regarded as irrefutable in any other sense. But in this
sense all fundamental beliefs are irrefutable as well as unprovable. The
test of proof or disproof is in fact irrelevant for the acceptance or
rejection of fundamental beliefs, and to claim that you strictly refrain
from believing anything that could be disproved is merely to cloak your
own will to believe your beliefs behind a false pretence of
self-critical severity.</p>
<p>This complacency is not lessened, but further enhanced by humbly
acknowledging the uncertainty of our own conclusions. For when we admit
that the proofs on which our beliefs are supposed to be founded may
conceivably be incomplete, we effectively cover up the brute fact that
we can have no proof at all to warrant them. Indeed, the emphatic
admission of our fallibility only serves to reaffirm our claim to a
fictitious standard of intellectual integrity and to bring out the
shining qualities of our open mind, in contrast to the hidebound
attitude of those who openly profess their beliefs as their final
personal commitment.</p>
<p>Doubt has been acclaimed not only as the touchstone of truth, but
also as the safeguard of tolerance. The belief that philosophic doubt
would appease religious fanaticism and bring about universal tolerance
goes back to Locke, and this belief is still vigorously alive in our own
day. Its most influential representative, Lord Russell, expressed it
eloquently many times, as for example in this passage:</p>
<p>Arians and Catholics, Crusaders and Muslims, Protestants and
adherents of the Pope, Communists and Fascists, have filled large parts
of the last 1600 years with futile strife, when a little philosophy
would have shown both sides in all these disputes that neither had any
good reason to believe itself in the right. Dogmatism . . . in the
present age as in former times, is the greatest of the mental obstacles
to human happiness.4</p>
<p>It remains deeply ingrained in the modern mind—as I find even in my
own mind—that though doubt may become nihilistic and imperil thereby all
freedom of thought, to refrain from belief is always an act of
intellectual probity as compared with the resolve to hold a belief which
we could abandon if we decided to do so. To accept a belief by yielding
to a voluntary impulse, be it my own or that of others placed in a
position of authority, is felt to be a surrender of reason. You cannot
teach the necessity for doing this without incurring—even in your own
heart—the suspicion of obscurantism. At every step in quest of a
post-critical philosophy the warning of the critical age will echo in
our minds. In the words of Kant:</p>
<p>Reason must in all its undertakings subject itself to criticism;
should it limit freedom of criticism by any prohibitions, it must harm
itself, drawing upon itself a damaging suspicion. Nothing is so
important through its usefulness, nothing so sacred, that it may be
exempted from this searching examination, which knows no respect for
persons. Reason depends on this freedom for its very existence.5</p>
<p>I shall not feel reassured in advocating an attitude of a-critical
belief, unless I have first fully met this warning by a critical
examination of the principle of doubt.</p>
