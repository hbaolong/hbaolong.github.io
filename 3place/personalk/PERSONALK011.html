<h4 id="the-nature-of-assertions">5. THE NATURE OF ASSERTIONS</h4>
<p>A sincere allegation is an act that takes place in speaking or in
writing down certain symbols. Its agent is the speaking or writing
person. Like all intelligent actions, such assertions have a passionate
quality attached to them. They express conviction to those to whom they
are addressed. We have on record the outcries of dizzy exultation to
which Kepler gave vent at the dawning of discovery, as well as those of
others at the false dawn of supposed discoveries. We know the violence
with which great pioneers like Pasteur have upheld their claims against
their critics and can hear the same angry impatience expressed today by
fanatical cranks like Lysenko. A doctor deciding on a serious diagnosis
in a difficult case or a juryman bringing in a fatal verdict in dubious
circumstances will feel the weight of a heavy personal responsibility.
In routine observations, unobstructed by opposition and unworried by
doubts, these passions are dormant but not absent; no sincere assertion
of fact is essentially unaccompanied by feelings of intellectual
satisfaction or of a persuasive desire and a sense of personal
responsibility. Therefore, in a strict usage the same symbol should
never represent the act of sincerely asserting something and the content
of what is asserted.</p>
<p>For the symbolic distinction between the two, Frege (1893) has
introduced the ‘signpost’ symbol This is prefixed to a statement p if p
is to signify the actual assertion of p, while the bare symbol p must
henceforth be used only as part of a sentence, whether asserted or
unasserted. Written down by itself the signpost symbol conveys as little
meaning as would a solitary question mark or exclamation mark, which are
its nearest analogues among existing symbols. This incompleteness of the
symbol has an important and perhaps not so readily acceptable correlate.
It suggests that a declaratory sentence is by itself also an incomplete
symbol. If language is to denote speech it must reflect the fact that we
never say anything that has not a definite impassioned quality. It
should be clear from the modality of a sentence whether it is a
question, a command, an invective, a complaint or an allegation of fact.
Since an unasserted declaratory sentence could not stand for an
allegation of fact, its modality would be unspecified and could
therefore denote no spoken sentence. There are words like ‘however’,
‘altogether’ or ‘into’, and clauses like ‘if I were king’, which, though
not meaningless, can have definite significance only as part of a
sentence. Similarly, I suggest, a sentence itself has only vague
significance until supplemented by the symbol defining its modality. In
the case of sentences intended to convey a factual communication this
requirement is fulfilled by a prefixed assertion sign. An unasserted
sentence is no better than an unsigned cheque; just paper and ink
without power or meaning.</p>
<p>But our signpost symbol is yet incompletely defined. It is clear that
I can make use of the sign to put on paper an allegation of my own; but
it has not been explained how this sign is to function between different
persons and between successive periods in the same person’s life. If the
sign is to signify the passionate act of sincerely pronouncing the
asserted sentence—while there are many people in the world and
innumerable moments in any single person’s life—the symbol p must be
supplemented, so that it may tell us whose allegation it represents and
at what time the person in question had alleged p. In the case of an
assertion made on paper, we may take all this to be expressed by the act
that the symbol p is written down by a particular person at a particular
moment. This is how Whitehead and Russell define the use of the sign in
their introduction to Principia Mathematica. They say that if an
asserted sentence is printed in a book and the assertion turns out to be
false the author will be blamed. Unfortunately the translation of the
sign into words, which Whitehead and Russell suggest, tends to obscure
their correct interpretation of it. They translate, for example, ‘ p
implies q’ into the words ‘it is asserted that p implies q’ But the
phrase ‘it is asserted’ suggests an impersonal happening of assertions:
‘it is asserted’, as ‘it is raining’ or ‘it happens’. The value of the
assertion sign is lost if we allow ourselves to revert in our verbal
translation of it to the muddle of a declaratory sentence which asserts
itself or is impersonally asserted by nobody in particular.</p>
<p>To avoid this, I may read the sign in a book by Whitehead and Russell
as ‘W. and R. assert . . .’; from which, after accepting their
conclusions, I may proceed to ‘I assert . . .’ But on closer scrutiny I
shall reject any wording which mentions assertion. For the significance
of my writing down ‘ p’ is not that I make an assertion but that I
commit myself to it; it is not the act of my uttering a sentence p that
I express by ‘ p’ but the fact that I believe what the sentence p says.
The correct reading of ‘ p’ written down by me in good faith is
therefore ‘I believe p’, or some other words expressing the same
fiduciary act.</p>
<p>It follows, further, that we cannot use the assertion sign as a
prefix to ‘I believe p’ For ‘ p’ and its verbal equivalent ‘I believe p’
stand for a present fiduciary act of my own, and an act cannot be
asserted. A declaratory sentence can be asserted, because it is an
incomplete symbol, of indeterminate modality; while a question, a
command, an invective, or any other sentence of fixed intention can no
more be asserted than could my act of hewing wood or of drinking tea. It
would be as meaningless to prefix the words ‘I believe’, or the
assertion sign which denotes these words, to such sentences of fully
qualified modality as it would be to any inarticulate act.7 It follows
that the words ‘I believe’ in the assertion ‘I believe p’ must not be
taken to form a declaratory sentence, and indeed no sentence at all.
They are more in the nature of an exclamation like ‘By Jove!’ or
thumping on the table; they seal a commitment, a vouching or
asseveration. Like the signpost symbol which it transposes into words,
the phrase ‘I believe’ acquires meaning only in conjunction with the
clause which follows it. The symbol and the phrase convey in their
respective terms the personal endorsement of the sentence prefixed by
them.</p>
<p>As a result of this enquiry into the act of affirmation we must deny
the possibility of casting the fiduciary element of an affirmation in
the form of a probability statement. A bare probability statement is
impersonal. This is equally true of a sentence like ‘the probability of
throwing a double six is 1/36’ and of a formula like P(H/E) stating that
the probability of an hypothesis H on the evidence E has the value P.
Being impersonal, these are all incomplete symbols, requiring to be
accompanied by the utterance of a personal commitment in order that they
may become the content of an assertion. But the act by which I set my
seal to any statement—be it an unambiguous statement or a statement of
probability—is a personal act of my own. It cannot, therefore, be
expressed by any symbol which would have the same meaning if uttered by
somebody else: that is, by any impersonal clause, such as an unasserted
probability statement.8</p>
<p>However, we must allow for the fact that a personal act can be partly
formalized. By reflecting on the way we are performing it we may seek to
establish rules for our own guidance in this act. But such formalization
is likely to go too far unless it acknowledges in advance that it must
remain within a framework of personal judgment. All attempts to
formulate the process of inductive inference go astray precisely in this
respect. The interpretation of our growing confidence in an empirical
proposition in view of the accumulating evidence in its favour, derived
from a calculus of probability such as that proposed by Keynes and his
followers, falls into this fallacious category. This type of theory
points out that any hypothesis H having a finite initial probability
will, if it happens to be true, be confirmed by subsequent evidence
until its degree of probability approaches complete certainty. Assuming
that the universe is such that hypotheses H of finite initial
probability do somehow present themselves to our minds, it concludes
that by testing all hypotheses thus presenting themselves to us we shall
eventually come to believe all those which are true with a degree of
probability approaching certainty.</p>
<p>To this it must be objected, first, that this condition would not be
sufficient in practice. In order that the method should work in
practice, the frequency of H being true must be not merely finite but of
quite appreciable magnitude. Life is too short to allow us to go on
testing millions of false H’s in order to hit on a true one. It is of
the essence of the scientific method to select for verification
hypotheses having a high chance of being true. To select good questions
for investigation is the mark of scientific talent, and any theory of
inductive inference in which this talent plays no part is a Hamlet
without the prince. The same holds for the process of verification.
Things are not labelled ‘evidence’ in nature, but are evidence only to
the extent to which they are accepted as such by us as observers. This
is true even for the most exact sciences. The Cambridge astronomer
Challis who undertook to verify the hypothesis of Leverrier and Adams
concerning the existence of a new planet, sighted the undiscovered
planet four times during the summer of 1846, and once even noticed that
it appeared to have a disc, but these facts made no impression on him,
for he distrusted altogether the hypothesis which he was testing.9
Challis acted mistakenly; but the example of D. C. Miller has shown that
it may be equally wrong to go on investigating facts that seem to
contradict a theory which is sufficiently well established on different
grounds. Indeed, no scientist can forgo selecting his evidence in the
light of heuristic expectations. And besides, we shall see that he may
well be unable to tell on what evidence E his belief in a hypothesis H
is founded. It is a travesty of the scientific method to conceive of it
as a process which depends on the speed of accumulating evidence
presenting itself automatically in respect to hypotheses selected at
random.10</p>
