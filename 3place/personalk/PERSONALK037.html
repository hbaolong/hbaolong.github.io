<h4 id="introduction-to-problem-solving">11. INTRODUCTION TO
PROBLEM-SOLVING</h4>
<p>There is a purposive tension from which no fully awake animal is
free. It consists in a readiness to perceive and to act, or more
generally speaking, to make sense of its own situation, both
intellectually and practically. From these routine efforts to retain
control of itself and of its surroundings, we can see emerging a process
of problem solving, when the effort tends to fall into two stages, a
first stage of perplexity, followed by a second stage of doing and
perceiving which dispels this perplexity. We may say that the animal has
seen a problem, if its perplexity lasts for some time and it is clearly
trying to find a solution to the situation which puzzles it. In doing
so, the animal is searching for a hidden aspect of the situation, the
existence of which it surmises, and for the finding or achieving of
which the manifest features of the situation serve it as tentative clues
or instruments.</p>
<p>To see a problem is a definite addition to knowledge, as much as it
is to see a tree, or to see a mathematical proof—or a joke. It is a
surmise which can be true or false, depending on whether the hidden
possibilities of which it assumes the existence do actually exist or
not. To recognize a problem which can be solved and is worth solving is
in fact a discovery in its own right. Famous mathematical problems have
descended from generation to generation, leaving in their wake a long
trail of achievements stimulated by the attempt at solving them. And
even at the level of animal experiments, we can see the psychologist
demonstrating to the animal the presence of a problem in order to start
it off in search of a solution. A rat in a discrimination box is made to
realize that there is food hidden in one of two compartments, both of
which are accessible, and only if it has grasped this will it start
searching for something which discriminates the door or screen with food
behind it from that of the empty compartment. Similarly, animals will
not start solving a maze unless they are made aware of the fact that
there exists a path through it, with some reward at its outlet. In
Köhler’s insight experiments his chimpanzees grasped their problem from
the start, and marked their appreciation of the task by composing
themselves quietly to concentrate on it.</p>
<p>Accident usually plays some part in discovery and its part may be
predominant. Learning experiments can be so arranged that, in the
absence of any clearly understood problem, discovery can only be
accidental.75 Mechanistically minded psychologists who devise such
experiments would explain all learning as the lucky outcome of random
behaviour. This conception of learning underlies also the cyberneticist
model of a machine which ‘learns’ by selecting the ‘habit’ which had
proved successful in a series of random trials. I shall disregard now
this model of heuristics, and continue to explore the process of
discovery resulting from intelligent effort, irrespective of the neural
model that may be proposed for it.</p>
<p>Intelligent problem-solving is manifested among animals most
effectively in Köhler’s experiments on chimpanzees, whose behaviour
already presents the characteristic stages through which, according to
Poincaré, discovery is achieved in mathematics. I have already mentioned
the first: the appreciation of a problem. A chimpanzee in a cage within
sight of a bunch of bananas out of its reach neither makes any futile
effort to get hold of it by sheer force, nor abandons its desire of
acquiring the prize. It settles down instead to an unusual calm, while
its eyes survey the situation all round the target; it has recognized
the situation as problematical and is searching for a solution.76 We may
acknowledge this (using the terminology of Wallas based on Poincaré) as
the stage of Preparation.77</p>
<p>In the most striking cases of insight observed by Köhler, this
preparatory stage is suddenly followed by intelligent action. Sharply
breaking its calm, the animal proceeds to carry out a stratagem by which
it secures its aim, or at least shows that it has grasped a principle by
which this can be done. Its unhesitating manner suggests that it is
guided by a clear conception of the whole proposed operation. This
conception is its discovery, or at least—since it may not always prove
practicable—its tentative discovery. We may recognize in its coming the
stage of Illumination. Since the practical realization of the principle
discovered by insight often presents difficulties which may even prove
insurmountable, the manipulations by which the animal puts his insight
to the test of practical realization may be regarded as the stage of
Verification.</p>
<p>Actually, Poincaré observed four stages of discovery: Preparation,
Incubation, Illumination, Verification.78 But the second of these,
Incubation, can be observed only in a rudimentary form in chimpanzees.
Yet the observation described in some detail by Köhler, in which one of
his animals sustained its effort of solving a problem even while
otherwise occupied for a time,79 anticipates to a remarkable extent the
process of incubation: that curious persistence of heuristic tension
through long periods of time, during which the problem is not
consciously entertained.</p>
<p>An extensive preoccupation with a problem imposes an emotional
strain, and a discovery which releases from it is a great joy. The story
of Archimedes rushing out from his bath into the streets of Syracuse
shouting ‘Eureka’ is a witness to this; and the account I have quoted
from Köhler, of the way his chimpanzees behaved before and after solving
a problem, suggests that they also experience such emotions. I shall
show this more definitely later. I mention it now only to make it clear
that nothing is a problem or discovery in itself; it can be a problem
only if it puzzles and worries somebody, and a discovery only if it
relieves somebody from the burden of a problem. A chess problem means
nothing to a chimpanzee or to an imbecile, and hence does not puzzle
them; a great chess master on the other hand may fail to be puzzled by
it because he finds its solution without effort; only a player whose
ability is about equal to the problem will find intense preoccupation in
it. Only such a player will appreciate its solution as a
discovery.80</p>
<p>It appears possible to appraise the comparative hardness of a
problem, and to test the intelligence of subjects by their capacity for
solving problems of a certain degree of hardness. The intelligence of
chimpanzees and the hardness of certain problems were both successfully
assessed by Köhler when he devised a series of problems, which some of
his apes could solve with some effort while others among them usually
failed altogether to do so. The success of Yerkes in setting problems to
earthworms (which these could solve after about a hundred trials), shows
that he could assess even such extremely low powers of intelligence as
were required here from the earthworm.81 Editors of a crossword column
undertake a similar feat in supplying their readers with a steady stream
of always equally difficult problems. We may conclude that while a
problem must always be regarded as being a problem to some kind of
person, it is possible for an observer reliably to recognize it as such
in respect to identifiable persons.</p>
<p>If an animal who has solved a problem is placed once more in the
original situation, it proceeds unhesitatingly to apply the solution
which it had originally discovered at the cost of much effort and
perhaps after many unsuccessful trials. This shows that by solving the
problem the animal has acquired a new intellectual power, which prevents
it from being ever again puzzled by the problem. Instead, it can now
deal with the situation in a routine manner involving no heuristic
tension and achieving no discovery. The problem has ceased to exist for
it. Heuristic progress is irreversible.</p>
<p>The irreversible character of discovery suggests that no solution of
a problem can be accredited as a discovery if it is achieved by a
procedure following definite rules. For such a procedure would be
reversible in the sense that it could be traced back stepwise to its
beginning and repeated at will any number of times, like any
arithmetical computation. Accordingly, any strictly formalized procedure
would also be excluded as a means of achieving discovery.</p>
<p>It follows that true discovery is not a strictly logical performance,
and accordingly, we may describe the obstacle to be overcome in solving
a problem as a ‘logical gap’, and speak of the width of the logical gap
as the measure of the ingenuity required for solving the problem.
‘Illumination’ is then the leap by which the logical gap is crossed. It
is the plunge by which we gain a foothold at another shore of reality.
On such plunges the scientist has to stake bit by bit his entire
professional life.</p>
<p>The width of the logical gap crossed by an inventor is subject to
legal assessment. Courts of law are called upon to decide whether the
ingenuity displayed in a suggested technical improvement is high enough
to warrant its legal recognition as an invention, or is merely a routine
improvement, achieved by the application of known rules of the art. The
invention must be acknowledged to be unpredictable, a quality which is
assessed by the intensity of the surprise it might reasonably have
aroused. This unexpectedness corresponds precisely to the presence of a
logical gap between the antecedent knowledge from which the inventor
started and the consequent discovery at which he arrived.</p>
<p>Established rules of inference offer public paths for drawing
intelligent conclusions from existing knowledge. The pioneer mind which
reaches its own distinctive conclusions by crossing a logical gap
deviates from the commonly accepted process of reasoning, to achieve
surprising results. Such an act is original in the sense of making a new
start, and the capacity for initiating it is the gift of originality, a
gift possessed by a small minority.</p>
<p>Since the Romantic movement originality has become increasingly
recognized as a native endowment which alone enables a person to
initiate an essential innovation. Universities and industrial research
laboratories are founded today on the employment of persons with
original minds. Permanent appointments are given to young scientists who
are credited with signs of originality, in the expectation that they
will continue to produce surprising ideas for the rest of their
lives.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are minor heuristic acts within the power of
ordinary intelligence which are indeed continuous with the adaptive
capacities of life down to its lowest levels. We have seen already that
whenever we make (or believe we have made) contact with reality, we
anticipate an indeterminate range of unexpected future confirmations of
our knowledge derived from this contact. The interpretative framework of
the educated mind is ever ready to meet somewhat novel experiences, and
to deal with them in a somewhat novel manner. In this sense all life is
endowed with originality and originality of a higher order is but a
magnified form of a universal biological adaptivity. But genius makes
contact with reality on an exceptionally wide range: seeing problems and
reaching out to hidden possibilities for solving them, far beyond the
anticipatory powers of current conceptions. Moreover, by deploying such
powers in an exceptional measure—far surpassing ours who are looking
on—the work of a genius offers us a massive demonstration of a
creativity which can neither be explained in other terms, nor taken
unquestioningly for granted. By paying respect to another person’s
judgment as superior to our own, we emphatically acknowledge originality
in the sense of a performance the procedure of which we cannot specify.
Confrontation with genius thus forces us to acknowledge the originative
power of life, which we may and commonly do neglect in its ubiquitous
lesser manifestations.</p>
<p>In choosing a problem the investigator takes a decision fraught with
risks. The task may be insoluble or just too difficult. In that case his
effort will be wasted and with it the effort of his collaborators, as
well as the money spent on the whole project. But to play safe may be
equally wasteful. Mediocre results are no adequate return for the
employment of high gifts, and may not even repay the money spent on
achieving them. So the choice of a problem must not only anticipate
something that is hidden and yet not inaccessible, but also assess the
investigator’s own ability (and those of his collaborators) against the
anticipated hardness of the task, and make a reasonable guess as to
whether the hoped for solution will be worth its price in terms of
talent, labour and money. To form such estimates of the approximate
feasibility of yet unknown prospective procedures, leading to unknown
prospective results, is the day-to-day responsibility of anyone
undertaking independent scientific or technical research. On such
grounds as these he must even compare a number of different possible
suggestions and select from them for attack the most promising problem.
Yet I believe that experience shows such a performance to be possible
and that it can be relied upon to function with a considerable degree of
reliability.</p>
