<h4 id="administration-of-civic-culture">8. ADMINISTRATION OF CIVIC
CULTURE</h4>
<p>Such are the cultural institutions which sustain the freedom of
individual thought in a free society. From these institutions we can
pass on to the ideal of popular government by extending their principles
to the cultivation of civic thought.</p>
<p>The machinery of self-government equips civic opinion with coercive
powers to enforce, if necessary, any reforms of the existing mores that
it holds to be right. If, therefore, opinion concerning civic matters is
allowed to take shape by the same principles which effectively sustain
the freedom of individual thought, civic thought will also grow freely
and the power wielded by it will be the power of free thought. This is
what would happen in an ideal free society. The shaping and
dissemination of moral convictions should take place in it under the
guidance of intellectual leaders, spread out over thousands of special
domains and competing at every point with their rivals for the assent of
the public.18</p>
<p>To describe the institutional framework within which moral, legal and
political opinions are thus continuously re-moulded in a free society
would lead us too far. Suffice it to give some of the results of this
process, which has radically changed life in the free countries since
the principles of social reform gained wider acceptance some 130 years
ago. There has taken place a far reaching humanization of the criminal
law and of the prison system, and similarly of discipline in the army
and the navy, while the same changes have gone on in the schools,
asylums, hospitals and within the family itself; the Factory Laws have
enforced more humane conditions of employment in an immense variety of
ways; new welfare institutions have been set up to provide for the sick
and the aged, for the disabled, the unemployed and the slum dwellers;
free education has greatly widened the prospects of poorer people’s
children; the legal disabilities of women, of Catholics, Jews and of the
colonial peoples have been removed or at least greatly reduced; the
extension of the franchise and the recognition of Trade Unions have
shifted the balance of power in favour of hitherto subordinate classes.
All these were moral improvements of society which in England’s history,
for example, can be traced back to a series of specific movements
appealing to the public conscience; movements which had usually been
evoked in the first place by persuasive individuals devoted to the
advocacy of one particular reform. Such is the dynamism of the modern
free society. It consists in the moral progress of civic thought, which
transmits its conclusions, through the machinery of self-government,
into acts of social reform. It is the practical outcome of an
intellectual process, moved by its own passions and guided by its own
standards.</p>
<p>The constitution of a free society expresses its acknowledgment of
these passions and standards. Its government bows in advance to the
moral consensus freely arrived at by its citizens, not because they so
decide, but because they are deemed competent to decide rightly, as the
authentic spokesman of the social conscience. I know that this runs
counter to current legal positivism, which refuses to qualify in any way
the ultimate authority of the ‘basic norm’ of a given legal structure.19
Let me add, therefore, that reforms of law are in fact merely components
of social reform. The laying down of new coercive rules proceeds within
a medium of voluntary informal changes: changes in manners of
intercourse, in family customs, in moral rules. Moreover, the law itself
is being changed informally through new judicial interpretations; great
new institutions are founded privately and the whole network of existing
contractual relations renewed voluntarily, in a thousand ways.20
Legislative reforms are embedded in these broader voluntary, private,
informal modifications of society, which the new laws serve to
consolidate and to provide with a new framework for ever new departures.
There can be no doubt that these broader changes of civic culture, which
form the dominant matrix of legislative reform, are determined by a
process of thought guided by its own standards and prompted by its own
passions.21</p>
<p>It might be objected that the passing of new laws is rarely
unanimous, and also that in society at large civic values are not
universally shared in the way in which scientific values or even
artistic values are. But the difference is only superficial: the clash
of contending opinions is perhaps more marked in civic matters, but even
so it is restricted to contemporary affairs. Few of the innumerable
social reforms carried out in Britain during the past 150 years would be
repudiated today by any important minority. If a nation could not agree
to this extent on its past civic achievements it would be in a state of
latent civil war and could not be held to legislate freely for itself.
Its self-government would be the coercive rule of a majority. The ruling
class might still follow the guidance of a persistent moral impulse, as
absolute rulers and dictators have sometimes done too, but the image of
a society continuously re-shaping its own life in the pursuit of civic
virtues freely fostered in its midst would no longer apply. We may take
it, then, that in an ideal free society civic life would be continuously
improved solely by the cultivation of moral principles.</p>
