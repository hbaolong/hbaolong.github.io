<h4 id="scientific-controversy">5. SCIENTIFIC CONTROVERSY</h4>
<p>Heuristic passion seeks no personal possession. It sets out not to
conquer, but to enrich the world. Yet such a move is also an attack. It
raises a claim and makes a tremendous demand on other men; for it asks
that its gift to humanity be accepted by all. In order to be satisfied,
our intellectual passions must find response. This universal intent
creates a tension: we suffer when a vision of reality to which we have
committed ourselves is contemptuously ignored by others. For a general
unbelief imperils our own convictions by evoking an echo in us. Our
vision must conquer or die.</p>
<p>Like the heuristic passion from which it flows, the persuasive
passion too finds itself facing a logical gap. To the extent to which a
discoverer has committed himself to a new vision of reality, he has
separated himself from others who still think on the old lines. His
persuasive passion spurs him now to cross this gap by converting
everybody to his way of seeing things, even as his heuristic passion has
spurred him to cross the heuristic gap which separated him from
discovery.</p>
<p>We can see, therefore, why scientific controversies never lie
altogether within science. For when a new system of thought concerning a
whole class of alleged facts is at issue, the question will be whether
it should be accepted or rejected in principle, and those who reject it
on such comprehensive grounds will inevitably regard it as altogether
incompetent and unsound. Take, for example, four contemporary issues:
Freud’s psychoanalysis, Eddington’s a priori system of physics, Rhine’s
‘Reach of the Mind’, or Lysenko’s environmental genetics. Each of the
four authors mentioned here has his own conceptual framework, by which
he identifies his facts and within which he conducts his arguments, and
each expresses his conceptions in his own distinctive terminology. Any
such framework is relatively stable, for it can account for most of the
evidence which it accepts as well established, and it is sufficiently
coherent in itself to justify to the satisfaction of its followers the
neglect for the time being of facts, or alleged facts, which it cannot
interpret. It is correspondingly segregated from any knowledge or
alleged knowledge rooted in different conceptions of experience. The two
conflicting systems of thought are separated by a logical gap, in the
same sense as a problem is separated from the discovery which solves the
problem. Formal operations relying on one framework of interpretation
cannot demonstrate a proposition to persons who rely on another
framework. Its advocates may not even succeed in getting a hearing from
these, since they must first teach them a new language, and no one can
learn a new language unless he first trusts that it means something. A
hostile audience may in fact deliberately refuse to entertain novel
conceptions such as those of Freud, Eddington, Rhine or Lysenko,
precisely because its members fear that once they have accepted this
framework they will be led to conclusions which they—rightly or
wrongly—abhor. Proponents of a new system can convince their audience
only by first winning their intellectual sympathy for a doctrine they
have not yet grasped. Those who listen sympathetically will discover for
themselves what they would otherwise never have understood. Such an
acceptance is a heuristic process, a self-modifying act, and to this
extent a conversion. It produces disciples forming a school, the members
of which are separated for the time being by a logical gap from those
outside it. They think differently, speak a different language, live in
a different world, and at least one of the two schools is excluded to
this extent for the time being (whether rightly or wrongly) from the
community of science.</p>
<p>We can now see, also, the great difficulty that may arise in the
attempt to persuade others to accept a new idea in science. We have seen
that to the extent to which it represents a new way of reasoning, we
cannot convince others of it by formal argument, for so long as we argue
within their framework, we can never induce them to abandon it.
Demonstration must be supplemented, therefore, by forms of persuasion
which can induce a conversion. The refusal to enter on the opponent’s
way of arguing must be justified by making it appear altogether
unreasonable.</p>
<p>Such comprehensive rejection cannot fail to discredit the opponent.
He will be made to appear as thoroughly deluded, which in the heat of
the battle will easily come to imply that he was a fool, a crank or a
fraud. And once we are out to establish such charges we shall readily go
on to expose our opponent as a ‘metaphysician’, a ‘Jesuit’, a ‘Jew’, or
a ‘Bolshevik’, as the case may be—or, speaking from the other side of
the Iron Curtain—as an ‘objectivist’, an ‘idealist’ and a
‘cosmopolitan’. In a clash of intellectual passions each side must
inevitably attack the opponent’s person.</p>
<p>Even in retrospect such conflicts can often be appreciated only in
these terms. They do not appear as scientific arguments, but as
conflicts between rival scientific visions, or else between scientific
values and extraneous interests interfering illegitimately with the due
process of scientific enquiry. I shall recall here four controversies to
illustrate this. The first is the Copernican, to which I have already
had occasion to refer. The other three occurred in the nineteenth
century and their outcome, like that of the earlier one, had an
effective part in developing our present sense of scientific value.</p>
<p>The Ptolemaic and Copernican theories opposed each other for a long
time as two virtually complete systems separated by a logical gap. The
facts known at any time during the 148 years from the publication of
Copernicus’ De Revolutionibus to the appearance of Newton’s Principia
could be accounted for by either theory. By 1619 the discovery of
Kepler’s third law may have tipped the balance in favour of
Copernicanism,23 but the non-appearance of any seasonal variation in the
angle at which the fixed stars are seen continued to present a serious
difficulty to this system. The mistaken argument that falling bodies
would not descend vertically to earth if it were in motion was disproved
by Galileo; but his explanation of the tides, which he regarded as a
crucial proof of terrestrial rotation, fell into a similar error. His
discovery of Jupiter’s moons was perhaps suggestive, but its
significance hardly justified his scornful invective against those who
refused to look at these moons through his telescope.24 The real ground
of Galileo’s conviction lay in his passionate appreciation of the
greater scientific value of the heliocentric view: a feeling which was
accentuated by his angry rebellion against Aristotle’s authority over
science. His opponents had on their side the common-sense view which
sees the earth at rest, and, above all, a vivid consciousness of man’s
uniqueness as the only particle of the universe that feels responsible
to God. Their craving to retain for man a location which corresponds to
his importance in the universe was the emotional force opposed to the
intellectual appeal of Copernicanism.25</p>
<p>The victory of Copernicanism rejected and suppressed this demand as
an illegitimate interference with the pursuit of science, and
established the principle that scientific truth shall take no account of
its religious or moral repercussions. But this principle is not
incontestable. It is rejected today by the Soviet theory that all
science is class science and must be guided by ‘partynost’,
party-spirit. It is contested also by the Catholic Church, as for
example in the Encyclical Humani Generis of 1950, and similarly by
biblical fundamentalists everywhere. My opposition to a universal
mechanical interpretation of things, on the ground that it impairs man’s
moral consciousness, also implies some measure of dissent from the
absolute moral neutrality of science. Yet though the issue is not
altogether closed, the principle of moral and religious indifference
prevails throughout modern science without facing so far any effective
rival to its rule, and the outcome of the Copernican controversy
continues to form an eminent support for this principle.26</p>
<p>Another tenet of modern science which emerged at an early stage from
its conflict with the Aristotelian and scholastic tradition is its ideal
of empiricism. Though I dissent from this ideal in its absolute form,
since I hold that the elimination of personal knowledge from science
would destroy science, I acknowledge the decisive achievements of
empiricism in opening the way to modern science. Nor do I deny, of
course, that science is constantly in danger from the incursion of empty
speculations, which must be watchfully resisted and cast out; but I hold
that the part played by personal knowledge in science makes it
impossible to formulate any precise rule by which such speculations can
be distinguished from properly conducted empirical investigations.
Empiricism is valid only as a maxim, the application of which itself
forms a part of the art of knowing. Some examples of the scientific
controversies in which maxims of scientific empiricism have acquired
their current meaning will show how controversial and misleading the
claims of empiricism have proved in some important instances.</p>
<p>The quixotic attack of the young Hegel on the empirical method of
science and his swift defeat at the hands of the scientists was one of
the great formative experiences of modern science. In the year 1800 a
band of six German astronomers, led by Bode, set out to search for a new
planet to fill a gap between Mars and Jupiter in the numerical series of
planetary distances, discovered by Titius and known as Bode’s Law. The
series is obtained by writing down the number 4, followed by the series
3 + 4, 2 × 3 + 4, 22 × 3 + 4, 23 × 3 + 4. . . etc. This gives for the
first eight places: 4, 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, 196, which can be shown
to correspond pretty well to the relative distances of the seven planets
known in 1800, provided you leave out the fifth number. Setting the
distance of the Earth arbitrarily at 10 you have the table:</p>
<p>The young Hegel poured scorn on an enquiry following up a numerical
rule which, being meaningless, could only be accidental. Arguing that
nature, shaped by immanent reason, must be governed by a rational
sequence of numbers, he postulated that the relative spacing of the
planets must conform to the Pythagorean series 1, 2, 3, 4(22), 9(32),
8(23), 27(33)—in which, however, he substituted 16 for 8. This would
limit the number of planets to 7 and allow a large gap between the
fourth and fifth planet, i.e. Mars and Jupiter. The quest for an eighth
planet to fill this gap was therefore chimerical.27</p>
<p>However, on January 1st, 1801, Bode’s party of astronomers discovered
the small planet Ceres in the region in question. Since then over 500
small planets have been found in that neighbourhood,28 and it may be
that these are fragments of a full sized planet that once occupied this
place.</p>
<p>Hegel was discomfited and the astronomers triumphed gleefully. This
was all to the good, for it confirmed a juster sense of scientific
value. But we should realise that it had little else to support it.
Whether Bode’s Law has any rational foundation or has been fulfilled so
far by mere coincidence (as Hegel had thought) is still open to question
today; opinions have changed on the subject repeatedly during the last
20 years.29 Thus Hegel may have been right in rejecting the astronomers’
grounds for the search for a new planet.</p>
<p>Yet I agree that the astronomers were right and Hegel was wrong. Why
so? Because the astronomers’ guess lay within a conceivable scientific
system, and so it was a kind of guess to which astronomers as scientists
are entitled. It was a competent guess, and—if Bode’s Law has any truth
in it—even a true guess; while Hegel’s inference was altogether
unscientific, incompetent. Fortunately Hegel guessed wrong and the
astronomers, though their guess was perhaps unjustified, did hit the
mark. But even if Hegel’s guess had proved right and the astronomers’
wrong, we would still reject Hegel’s vision of reality and cleave to
that of the astronomers.</p>
<p>The revulsion of scientists against Naturphilosophie was violent and
lasting. By the middle of the century empiricism ruled unchallenged.30
But unfortunately the empirical method of enquiry—with its associated
conceptions of scientific value and of the nature of reality—is far from
unambiguous, and conflicting interpretations of it had therefore ever
again to fight each other from either side of a logical gap.</p>
<p>In his doctoral thesis, presented in 1875 to the University of
Utrecht, J. H. van’t Hoff had put forward the theory that compounds
containing an asymmetric carbon atom are optically active. In 1877 there
appeared a German translation of this work with a commendatory
introduction by Wislicenus, a distinguished German chemist and an
authority on optical activity. This publication evoked a furious attack
from Kolbe, another leading German chemist, who had recently published
an article called ‘Signs of the Times’,31 in which he castigated the
decline of rigorous scientific training among German chemists; a decline
which, he said, had led to a renewed sprouting of</p>
<p>the weeds of a seemingly learned and brilliant but actually trivial
and empty Philosophy of Nature, which, after having been replaced some
50 years ago by the exact sciences, is now once more dug up by
pseudo-scientists from the lumber room of human fallacies, and like a
trollop, newly attired in elegant dress and make-up, is smuggled into
respectable company, to which she does not belong.</p>
<p>In a second paper,32 he gave as a further example of this aberration
an account of van’t Hoflf’s work which ‘he would have ignored like many
other efforts of its kind’ but for ‘the incomprehensible fact’ of its
warm recommendation by so distinguished a chemist as Wislicenus. So
Kolbe wrote:</p>
<p>A certain Dr. J. H. van’t Hoff, employed by the Veterinary Academy at
Utrecht, appears to have no taste for exact chemical research. He found
it more convenient to mount Pegasus (borrowed no doubt from the
Veterinary Academy) and to proclaim in his La Chimie dans I’espace how
on his daring flight to the chemical Parnassus the atoms appeared to him
disposed in world space.</p>
<p>Kolbe’s comment on the introduction given by Wislicenus to van’t
Hoff’s theory reveals even further the principles of his criticism.
Wislicenus had written of ‘this real and important step in the
advancement of the theory of carbon compounds, a step which was organic
and internally necessary’. Kolbe asks: What is ‘the theory of carbon
compounds’? What is meant by saying that ‘this step was organic and
necessary’? And he goes on: ‘Wislicenus has here expelled himself from
the ranks of exact scientists and has joined instead the nature
philosophers of ominous memory who are separated only by a slender
“medium” from the spiritists.’</p>
<p>Scientific opinion eventually repudiated Kolbe’s attack on van’t Hoff
and Wislicenus, but his suspicion of speculative chemistry (‘paper
chemistry’) continues to be shared by most of the leading chemical
journals, which refuse up to this day contributions containing no new
experimental results. In spite of the fact that chemistry is largely
based on the speculations by Dalton, Kekulé and van’t Hoff, which were
initially unaccompanied by any experimental observations,33 chemists
still remain suspicious of this kind of work. Since they do not
sufficiently trust themselves to distinguish true theoretical
discoveries from empty speculations, they feel compelled to act on a
presumption which may one day cause the rejection of a theoretical paper
of supreme importance in favour of comparatively trivial experimental
studies. So difficult is it even for the expert in his own field to
distinguish, by the criteria of empiricism, scientific merit from
incompetent chatter.</p>
<p>Nor does this apply only to purely theoretical discoveries. The great
controversy on the nature of alcoholic fermentation which, starting in
1839, went on for almost forty years, showed that the verification of an
experimental observation may run into precisely the same difficulties.
From 1835 to 1837 no less than four independent observers (Caignard de
la Tour, Schwann, Kiitzing and Turpin) had reported that yeast produced
during fermentation was not a chemical precipitate, but consisted of
living cellular organisms which multiplied by budding, and had concluded
that fermentation was a living function of yeast cells.34 But this went
against the dominant intellectual passion of contemporary scientists. In
1828, Wöhler had synthetized urea from inorganic materials and had
triumphantly disproved thereby the existence of powers hitherto ascribed
exclusively to living beings. Liebig had followed suit by laying the
foundations of a chemical approach to all living matter, and Berzelius
recognized that platinum could speed up reactions occurring in its
presence, in the same way in which fermentation was caused by yeast. All
three great masters poured scorn on claims which they regarded as a
fantastic resurgence of the kind of ‘vitalism’ they had banned for ever.
Wöhler and Liebig published an elaborate skit making fun of these absurd
speculations.35</p>
<p>In 1857 Pasteur entered the lists on the side of the ‘vitalists’. His
investigations on yeast and putrefaction involved him at the same time
in another fierce controversy of longer standing, the question of
‘spontaneous generation’. In this, too, he was on the side considered at
the time reactionary (and still so considered, at the time of writing
this, in the Soviet Union), which denied that living beings could be
produced experimentally from dead matter.36</p>
<p>The reason why both these controversies dragged on indefinitely is
revealed by a remark of Pasteur concerning his own arguments for
regarding fermentation as a function of the living cells of yeast: ’If
anyone should say that my conclusions go beyond the established facts
(he wrote) I would agree, in the sense that I have taken my stand
unreservedly in an order of ideas which, strictly speaking, cannot be
irrefutably demonstrated.’37 This order of ideas was therefore separated
by a logical gap from that entertained by Liebig, Wohler and many other
great men of his time. The schism was eventually bridged bya conceptual
reform induced by Buchner’s discovery, in 1897, of zymase in the liquor
squeezed out of yeast cells. The agent of fermentation was proved a dead
catalyst of the kind imagined by Liebig and Berzelius, but it also
proved a vital organ of yeast cells, as Pasteur and his precursors since
Caignard de la Tour had affirmed; the new conception of intracellular
enzymes combined these two aspects.38</p>
<p>The great scientific controversies which I have just recalled were
conducted in passionate accents, as was inevitable between contestants
who shared no common framework within which a more impersonal procedure
could be followed. Kolbe could not argue against van’t Hoff. He quoted
with ironical glee van’t Hoff’s description of the disposition of atoms
in spirals, which to him was sufficient evidence that the new theory was
a tissue of fancies. And from his own point of view he was right in
refusing to enter into any detailed argument on these lines, since he
denied that one could argue rationally in terms of such wild ideas. The
ironical caricature by which Wohler and Liebig replied to the papers of
Caignard de la Tour, Schwann and others, who claimed that fermentation
is a function of living yeast cells, sprang from the same view that an
argument believed to be wholly specious cannot be seriously discussed
point by point.39 A Western scientist challenged to answer Lysenko’s
biological theories would similarly refuse to discuss them on the
Marxist-Leninist grounds on which they were put forward; while, on the
other hand, Lysenko refuses to consider the statistical evidence for
Mendelism on the grounds that ‘in science there is no place for
chance’.40</p>
<p>We may conclude that empiricism, like the moral neutrality of
science, is a principle laid down and interpreted for us by the outcome
of past controversies about the scientific value of particular sets of
ideas. Our appreciation of scientific value has developed historically
from the outcome of such controversies, much as our sense of justice has
taken shape from the outcome of judicial decisions through past
centuries. Indeed, all our cultural values are the deposits of a similar
historic succession of intellectual upheavals. But ultimately, all past
mental strife can be interpreted today only in the light of what we
ourselves decide to be the true outcome and lesson of this history. And
we have to take this decision within the context of contemporary
controversies which perhaps challenge these lessons afresh and raise in
their turn quite novel questions of principle. The lesson of history is
what we ourselves accept as such.</p>
<p>There are serious questions still open today concerning the nature of
things. At least, I believe them to be open, though the great majority
of scientists are convinced that the view they themselves hold is right
and scorn any challenge to it. A notorious example is offered by
extra-sensory perception. The evidence for it is ignored today by
scientists in the hope that it will one day find some trivial
explanation. In this they may be right, but I respect those too who
think they may be wrong; and no profitable discussion is possible
between the two sides at this stage.</p>
<p>Another example. Neurologists today accept almost without exception
the assumption that all conscious mental processes can be interpreted as
epiphenomena of a chain of material events occurring in the nervous
system. Some writers, like Dr. Mays,41 myself42 and Professor R. O.
Kapp,43 have tried to show that this is logically untenable, but to my
knowledge only one neurologist, namely Professor J. C. Eccles, has gone
so far as to amend the neurological model of the brain, by introducing
an influence by which the will intervenes to determine the choice
between two possible alternative decisions.44 This suggestion is
scornfully ignored by all other neurologists, and indeed, it is
difficult to argue profitably about it from their point of view.</p>
<p>A similar schism is present today between the ruling school of
genetics, which explains evolution as a result of a haphazard sequence
of mutations, and writers like Graham Cannon in England, Dalcq in
Belgium, Vandel and others in France, who consider this explanation
inadequate and support the assumption of a harmonious adaptive power
controlling the most important innovations in the origin of higher forms
of life.</p>
<p>Some people may listen to these illustrations with impatience, for
they believe that science provides a procedure for deciding any such
issues by systematic and dispassionate empirical investigations.
However, if that were clearly the case, there would be no reason to be
annoyed with me. My argument would have no persuasive force, and could
be ignored without anger.</p>
<p>At any rate, let me make quite clear what I have urged here. I have
said that intellectual passions have an affirmative content; in science
they affirm the scientific interest and value of certain facts, as
against any lack of such interest and value in others. This selective
function—in the absence of which science could not be defined at all—is
closely linked to another function of the same passions in which their
cognitive content is supplemented by a conative component. This is their
heuristic function. The heuristic impulse links our appreciation of
scientific value to a vision of reality, which serves as a guide to
enquiry. Heuristic passion is also the mainspring of originality—the
force which impels us to abandon an accepted framework of interpretation
and commit ourselves, by the crossing of a logical gap, to the use of a
new framework. Finally, heuristic passion will often turn (and have to
turn) into persuasive passion, the mainspring of all fundamental
controversy.</p>
<p>I am not applauding the outbreak of such passions. I do not like to
see a scientist trying to bring an opponent into intellectual contempt,
or to silence him in order to gain attention for himself; but I
acknowledge that such means of controversy may be tragically
inevitable.</p>
