<h4 id="articulation">5. ARTICULATION</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>W. N. and L. A. Kellogg, The Ape and the Child, New York,
1933.</p></li>
<li><p>The superiority of the child is greater than Kellogg and
Kellogg’s comparison would suggest in view of the shorter time in which
the chimpanzee reaches its maturity. But other observations restrict the
range of this advantage. It seems established now, for example, that
many animals, and among them notably birds, can be taught to identify
numbers. They can recognize the number of objects presented to them and
also reproduce a fixed number of consecutive acts. The numbers
identified range up to the number eight. Otto Köhler, who most
effectively established this fact, found also that human subjects cannot
identify the number of any more numerous group of objects than birds
can, provided that the subjects are not allowed time to count them. (Cf.
W. H. Thorpe, Ibis, 93 (1951), p. 48, who quotes seven papers by O.
Köhler published from 1935–50.)</p></li>
<li><p>My use of the words ‘articulate’, ‘articulation’, etc., in this
chapter is wider than the common linguistic usage, in which these terms
refer only to the actual enunciation of the sounds of language. The
context, however, should make my meaning clear, and it is not without
precedent. See for example: A. D. Sheffield, Grammar and Thinking, New
York and London, 1912, p. 22: ‘Psychologically, the simple assertory
sentence expresses the articulation of a conceptual whole into such of
its elements as are pertinent to the interest guiding the train of
thought.’</p></li>
<li><p>I shall set aside at this stage the question whether learning may
be represented within an extended framework of physiology, either as
experimental conditioning or as stimulated maturation, for this need not
affect the practical distinction between lower and higher performances,
of which the former are said to fall below and the latter above the
intelligent level.</p></li>
<li><p>B. F. Skinner, The Behavior of Organisms, New York,
1938.</p></li>
<li><p>This criticism of the conditioned reflex theory is well known.
See e.g. D. O. Hebb, The Organization of Behavior, New York, 1949,
p. 175.</p></li>
<li><p>See Hilgard, Theories of Learning (2nd edition), New York, 1956,
pp. 106–7, quoting I. Krechevsky (1932 and 1933) on ‘hypotheses’ in
rats. Lashley had already said that normal animals never behave in
random fashion. (Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence, Chicago, 1929,
p. 138.)</p></li>
<li><p>Hilgard, op. cit. (1st edn., 1948), p. 333, distinguished between
motor learning and perceptual learning (cf. 2nd edn., p. 466).</p></li>
<li><p>This was beautifully demonstrated, for example, by an experiment
of Tolman and Honzik described in Hilgard, op. cit., 2nd edn., p. 194
(fig. 26), from E. C. Tolman and C. H. Honzik, Univ. Calif. Publ.
Psychol., 4, (1940), 215–32. Hilgard mentions some recent criticism of
this experiment but maintains his account of it.</p></li>
<li><p>E. C. Tolman, ‘Cognitive maps in rats and men’, in Collected
Papers in Psychology, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1951, pp. 261–4 (from
Psych. Rev., 55 (1948), 189–208).</p></li>

pp. 123, 194.</p></li>
<li><p>J. Piaget, Psychology of Intelligence, London, 1950.</p></li>
<li><p>Piaget describes the way babies seem to explore the variable
appearances of an object at different distances by alternately
approaching it to their eyes or moving it away at arm’s length. Ibid.,
pp. 130 ff.</p></li>
<li><p>ibid., pp. 161–2.</p></li>
<li><p>ibid., p. 62; Judgement and Reasoning in the Child, London, 1928,
pp. 173, 176.</p></li>
<li><p>These three forms or functions of language are a matter for
general agreement among linguistic theorists. The functions of
‘Ausdruck, Appel, Darstellung’ distinguished by K. Bühler
(Sprachtheorie, Jena, 1934), are adopted, for example, by D. V.
McGranahan, in ‘The Psychology of Language’ (Psychological Bulletin,
1936, 33, pp. 178–216); or by Bruno Snell in Der Aufbau der Sprache
(Hamburg, 1952), p. 11. Cf. also George Humphrey, Thinking, London,
1951, p. 217. On the other hand, the question whether and how one of the
three functions is pre-eminent in the origin of language, whether in the
individual or the species, is a matter for extensive and sharp
disagreement (see e.g. the survey by McGranahan, loc. cit., pp. 179 f.,
or of types of expressive theory by L. H. Gray, Foundations of Language,
New York, 1939, p. 40, cf. also G. Révész, Origin and Prehistory of
Language, London, 1955). The present argument lies outside the range of
this controversy, and its restriction to the representative function is
not meant to endorse, e.g. a ‘Representative’ as against an ‘Expressive’
or ‘Evocative’ theory. I am engaged here not in constructing still
another theory of the origin of language, but in an epistemological
reflection on the relation of language to its inarticulate roots. Some
of the theories of linguists have of course certain affinities with my
own: for example, Sapir’s analysis of the conceptual role of speech in
Language (New York, 1921); or A. H. Gardiner’s insistence, in the Theory
of Speech and Language (London, 1932), on the importance of the
‘thing-meant’ in the speech situation; or W. J. Entwhistle’s rebellion
against the more extremely behaviouristic linguists: ’The chief error of
the mechanical view is to eliminate Man from his own speech, treating
the latter as if it were a machine independent of Man (Aspects of
Language, London, 1953, p. 39). But the linguists are concerned,
reasonably enough, with the verbal techniques of speech itself: not
primarily, as I am, with the nature of spoken truth in view of its
inarticulate and unformalizable grounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, this is not to prejudge the case for the importance of tu
as against ego in the beginnings of speech (see Entwhistle, op. cit.,
pp. 15–24), nor to enter into the controversy as to how egocentric or
otherwise is the speech of small children (see D. McCarthy, ‘Language
Development’ in Murchison, Handbook of Child Psychology, Worcester,
Mass., 1933, pp. 278–315). I am merely concerned here to deal with one
aspect of language which undoubtedly does exist.</p></li>
<li><p>I am here drawing a dividing line at a rather different place
from the one usual among psychologists, who have been interested, back
to the Würzburg school, in the distinction between verbalized and
‘wordless’ thought. I should prefer to consider, along with Samuel
Butler in the essay already quoted, that Mrs. Bentley’s snuff-box was
language.</p></li>
<li><p>Cf. Locke, Essay concerning Human Understanding, Book III, ch. 3,
sect. 2–4, where the existence of universal terms is derived from a
somewhat similar argument, Cf. also E. Sapir, op. cit., p. 11.</p></li>
<li><p>Cf. E. Sapir, op. cit., p. 39.</p></li>
<li><p>As for example when Michael Bruce is reputed to have saved the
life of Lafayette, because historians have substituted ‘Lafayette’ for
the obscurer title of the Marquis de Lavalette.</p></li>
<li><p>See Snell, op. cit., p. 171, quoting Leumann, Homerische Wörter,
Basel, 1950, etc. Cf. also S. Ullmann, The Principles of Semantics,
Glasgow, 1951, pp. 234 ff.</p></li>
<li><p>I. A. Richards (‘Responsibilities in the teaching of English’,
Harvard Educational Review, 20 (1950), p. 37), observes that the
distinctiveness of a sign consists in its safety from being mistaken for
another sign. In the Latin alphabet the three letters o, c, e are least
distinctive for they are more or less incomplete forms of each other.
Liable to be mistaken for each other are also symmetrical, p b, q b, u
n, p q, d b; and among numerals 6 and 9. The article mentions the ‘trick
of seeing’ a letter, which is more difficult to learn for letters that
can be more easily mistaken for each other.</p></li>
<li><p>The question whether adverbs are ‘really’ words, or only
pseudo-words (see S. Ullmann, op. cit., pp. 58–9) may be left open
here.</p></li>
<li><p>It is this intelligence which the infant begins to develop as he
begins to speak. See J. Piaget, ‘Le Language et la Pensée du point du
vue génètique’, in G. Révész, Thinking and Speaking, Amsterdam, 1954,
p. 51; W. F. Leopold, ‘Semantic Learning in Infant Language’, Word, 4
(1948), pp. 173–80.</p></li>

Psychology, 12 (1931), pp. 181–94.</p></li>

7, p. 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Comp. Ernst Topitsch, ‘The Sociology of Existentialism’, Partisan
Review (1954), p. 296.</p></li>
<li><p>L. Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, London, 1922,
p. 1889, I shall have something to say later of the attempts to modify
the demand for precision by referring to more informal kinds of
language. Some of the difficulties encountered in this programme are
described by P. L. Heath in ‘The Appeal to Ordinary Language’,
Philosophical Quarterly, 2 (1952), pp. 1–12.</p></li>
<li><p>Cf. A. N. Whitehead, Essays in Science and Philosophy, London,
1948, p. 73: ‘There is not a sentence which adequately states its own
meaning. There is always a background of presupposition which defies
analysis by reason of its infinitude.’ Whitehead proceeds to illustrate
this maxim by the example ‘One and one make two’. See below, Part Three,
ch. 8.</p></li>
<li><p>The same difficulty of effective representation arises in respect
to other aggregates of opaque objects: e.g. the representation of the
arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice or of the arrangement of parts
in a complex machine. Students of crystallography or of engineering have
to think in terms of these elements, the pictorial representation of
which must always remain fragmentary. On machines, cf. F. Kainz,
‘Vorformen des Denkens’, in Révész, op. cit., pp. 61–110: p. 85, ‘das
mechanische Denken’. The task of mapping geological strata presents
similar problems, for which geologists have recently been devising new
and imaginative techniques. See L. Dudley Stamp, The Earth’s Crust,
London, 1951; and for the newly developed ‘ribbon technique’ W. E.
Nevill, ‘The Millstone Grit and Lower Coal Measures of the Leinster
Coalfield’, Proc. Royal Irish Acad., 58, B1 (1956), plates III, IV, and
V; or British Regional Survey, Pennines and Adjacent Uplands, Department
of Scientific and Industrial Research: Geological Survey and Museum,
1954.</p></li>
<li><p>p. 58.</p></li>
<li><p>Our widened use of the word ‘understanding’ makes it comprise the
domain of ‘conception’ as well as that of ‘schema’, the term used by
Claparede and Piaget for designating a complex motoric faculty. I shall
use these words interchangeably, to stand for a kind of latent
knowledge, or aspects of such knowledge, as distinct from any overt
performances based on this kind of knowledge. Later on ‘intuition’ or
‘insight’ will be introduced to describe the act of understanding,
particularly in mathematics.</p></li>
<li><p>This is reminiscent of the distinction between ‘nom’ and ‘sens’
by Saussure (see Ullmann, op. cit., pp. 70–1); but his insistence that
he is considering this relation apart from the relation to the referent
or thing-meant, puts his analysis out of court for the purpose of my
argument.</p></li>
<li><p>p. 57.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiments have shown the rather obvious fact that the context
of a text is learned faster than its words if the text is understood. J.
A. McGeoch, The Psychology of Human Learning, New York and London, 1942,
p. 166. In a more recent experiment at Oxford, when one group of people
wrote out a summary of a passage of 300 words from memory immediately
after hearing it, and a second group made a précis of the same passage
while consulting the text, the remembered versions and the précis were
found to be indistinguishable. The experimenter, Dr. Gumulicki,
concludes that this indicates ‘the operation of an unwittingly
abstractive procedure which seems to develop concurrently with the
process of understanding the passage as it is being read’. See Harry
Kay, in Experimental Psychology, Ed. B. A. Farrell, 1955,
p. 14.</p></li>
<li><p>The classic text for this distinction is the De Magistro of
St. Augustine.</p></li>
<li><p>op. cit., ‘Denken und Sprechen’, pp. 3 ff.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no third domain where our attention is focussed on the
words or other symbols in themselves, so that we utter and operate them
altogether without attending to their meaning. Such purely mechanical
handling of symbols, guided by no intelligent purpose, would be futile.
Even when carrying out a computation by a machine, we turn its handle in
confidence in the outcome, and in doing so rely on the operational
principles of the machine. No meaningless thing can be acknowledged as a
symbol and no meaningless manipulation can be acknowledged as a symbolic
operation. In this sense formalization must always remain necessarily
incomplete. This has already been repeatedly foreshadowed and will be
further elaborated later.</p></li>

<li><p>The irreducible indeterminacy inherent in the meaning of all
descriptions and the origin and function of this indeterminacy in
relating meaning to reality was affirmed and elaborated in my Science,
Faith and Society, Oxford, 1946, pp. 8–9. Waismann’s ‘open texture’
(‘Verifability’, PAS Suppl., 19 (1945), stated part of the same
reflections within a context of regulative principles which I find
unacceptable (see p. 113 below).</p></li>

and their Relation to Apparent Distance’, J. Psychol., 30 (1950),

Princeton, 1952.</p></li>
<li><p>The normal way of seeing objects ‘right way up’ satisfies our
self-set standards of coherence between visual and tactile, as well as
proprioceptive, clues. Spectacles which invert our retinal pictures make
us see objects ‘upside down’. But after a few days’ habituation to the
spectacles the eye restores coherence once more by seeing things now
right way up through the spectacles. On removing the spectacles, objects
now appear upside down, without the spectacles, but eventually coherence
is restored again by the reestablishment of normal vision (I. Köhler,
Die Pyramide, 5 (1953), 92–5, 6 (1953), 109–13).</p></li>

process.</p></li>

<li><p>The following is an example, observed by Köhler in a chimpanzee.
The chimpanzee is at liberty and armed with a stick. A banana lies on
the floor inside a cage; the cage is boarded on three sides; there is a
gap in the horizontal boards on the side to which the objective is
nearest, and there are vertical bars on the opposite side. Thus the
arrangement is such that the animal can get at the banana only by
pushing it away from the boarded-up side by means of its stick towards
the bars on the opposite side, where she can reach it by walking round
the cage. The animal has discovered this solution and has practised it
before. She is now about to repeat it, and has started pushing the
banana away from herself across the floor of the cage; but suddenly,
interrupted by a noise, she apparently forgets her intention and yields
to the more primitive impulse of pulling the banana towards herself
(which is useless since the boards prevent her from reaching the
prize)—then, having finished this useless pulling, she walks round to
the other side of the cage, intending apparently to reach for the banana
as usual, though it is of course quite inaccessible from here. ‘Nobody’,
writes Köhler, ‘could look more nonplussed than Chica, when she peered
into the cage and saw the objective as far as it could be from the bars’
(op. cit., p. 267). The motoric schema ‘pushing banana with stick away,
followed by walking round to get it through the bars’ gets mixed up here
with the schema ‘hauling banana towards yourself’. The animal goes on
operating the first, though its lapse into the second had cancelled its
premises. The uneasiness shown by animals puzzled by a problem will be
described later more fully.</p></li>

given currency by Poincaré in Science and Method. Its fallacy was
revealed by observations of the bi-refringence of crystals and of the
capacity of condensers, both of which should be, but proved not,
measurably affected by the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction.</p></li>

<li><p>Changes in the meaning of words have of course been extensively
studied by linguists. My examples taken from science should demonstrate
that the accompanying conceptual decisions rank with other discoveries
of science. This suggests that changes of meaning may quite generally

<li><p>This is the aspect of meaning stressed by the ‘context’ school,
notably Weisgerber and Trier. See summary by S. Ullmann, op. cit.,

<li><p>The same criticism applies to Wittgenstein’s use of the term
‘language-game’.</p></li>
<li><p>Such a process of classification implies an empirical
generalization of a kind usually disregarded in the attempted
formalizations of induction. This is pointed out by H. Jeffreys (‘The
Present Position in Probability Theory’, Brit. J. Phil. Sc., 5 (1954–5),
pp. 275 ff., 282): ‘It seems to me that the epistemology of this process
has been unduly neglected. It is of far wider application than Laplacian
induction, and the principles involved in framing and arranging the
questions seem to me the sort of thing that philosophers might have
something to say about.’</p></li>

documents and government regulations, which are carefully worded to
achieve the greatest precision, are notoriously unintelligible.</p></li>
<li><p>Guthrie and Horton placed a cat in a cage in which a small pole,
placed in the middle of the floor, acted as release mechanism. Cats who
had touched the pole by accident and found themselves freed in
consequence, quickly realized the connection and proceeded to repeat
their releasing action in an exactly stereotyped manner. The situation
in which the cat was placed offered no intelligible problem to the cat
and the solution, found accidentally, showed no clear understanding of
the release mechanism; the role played by intelligence in the whole
process was negligible (comp. Hilgard, op. cit., pp. 65–8).</p></li>
<li><p>‘The greatest impression on the visitor (writes Köhler) was made
when Sultan made a pause, scratching his head leisurely and not moving
anything but his eyes and very slightly his head, scrutinizing the
situation around him in the minutest detail’, The Mentality of Apes,
London, 1927, p. 200.</p></li>
<li><p>G. Wallas, The Art of Thought, London, 1946, pp. 40 ff.</p></li>
<li><p>‘Verification’ means, of course, in mathematics, ‘demonstration’,
and is therefore closer to what I describe later (Part Two, ch. 6,
p. 202) as ‘validation’ rather than to the ‘verification’ of
experimental science.</p></li>
<li><p>An ape which for a while had been searching for a tool to rake in
a bunch of bananas lying outside its cage, and had made various
fruitless attempts in this direction—such as trying to break off a board
from the lid of a wooden case or hitting out with a stalk of straw in
the direction of the prize—had apparently abandoned the task altogether.
It went on playing with one of its fellows for about 10 minutes without
turning again to the bananas outside the cage. Then suddenly, its
attention having been diverted from its game by a shout nearby, its eyes
happened to fall on a stick attached to the roof of the cage, and at
once it went for the stick and by jumping up a number of times finally
secured it and hauled in the bananas by its aid. We may take this to
show that even while otherwise occupied the animal kept its problem
alive ‘at the back of its mind’, keeping it ready to pounce on the
instruments of a solution when they happened to meet its eye. Köhler,
op. cit., p. 184.</p></li>
<li><p>Kurt Lewin has observed that we do not become emotionally
involved either in a task that is too easy or in one that is too
difficult, but only in tasks that we can master at our best. Hoppe,
following Lewin, calls this the measure of ego-involvement. See Hilgard,
op. cit., p. 277.</p></li>

<li><p>A distinguished effort to lay down heuristic maxims has been made
in our time by the mathematician G. Polya (How to Solve It, Princeton,
1945, and Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning, 2 vols., London, 1954),
mainly with a view to giving guidance for the teaching of mathematics.
Penetrating observations on problem solving have also been contributed
by the psychologists, mainly by Duncker and by Wertheimer.</p></li>
<li><p>A. M. Turing (Science News, 31 (1954)) has computed the number of
arrangements that would have to be surveyed in the process of solving
systematically a very common form of puzzle, consisting of sliding
squares to be rearranged in a particular way. The number is
20,922,789,888,000. Working continuously day and night and inspecting
one position per minute the process would take 4 million years.</p></li>

process of inference. See Part Three, ch. 8, p. 260.</p></li>
