<h4 id="superior-knowledge">9. SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE</h4>
<p>Let me concentrate on the exchanges taking place between equals
within the medium of a common complex culture. I must recall here
briefly the social matrix of a complex culture, in order to look upon it
now as an extension of the rising levels of life which form the subject
matter of biology. Take two scientists discussing a problem of science
on an equal footing. Each will rely on standards which he believes to be
obligatory both for himself and the other. Every time either of them
makes an assertion as to what is true and valuable in science, he relies
blindly on a whole system of collateral facts and values accepted by
science. And he relies also on it that his partner relies on the same
system. Indeed, the bond of mutual trust thus formed between the two is
but one link in the vast network of confidence between thousands of
scientists of different specialities, through which—and through which
alone—a consensus of science is established which may be said to accept
certain facts and values as scientifically valid. I have described
before how small a fragment of science is clearly visible to any one
scientist. I have shown also that a system of scientific facts and
standards can be said to exist only to the extent to which each
scientist trusts all the others, to uphold his own special sector of the
system in respect of his research, his teaching and his administrative
actions. Though each may dissent (as I am myself dissenting) from some
of the accepted standards of science, such heterodoxies must remain
fragmentary if science is to survive as a coherent system of superior
knowledge, upheld by people mutually recognizing each other as
scientists, and acknowledged by modern society as its guide.</p>
<p>I have shown in some detail also how this mediated consensus operates
in the pursuit and dissemination of scientific knowledge, and have
outlined the analogous operations of such a consensus in the wider
domains of a complex modern culture (pp. 216 ff.). Envisaging this
consensus now as an extension of the biological achievements to which
our ascending survey of living beings has led us, I shall regard the
entire culture of a modern, highly articulate community as a form of
superior knowledge. This superior knowledge will be taken to include,
therefore, beside the systems of science and other factual truths, all
that is coherently believed to be right and excellent by men within
their culture. My own appreciation of any ‘superior knowledge’ within a
foreign culture is subject, of course, to my acknowledgment of the
superior knowledge of my own culture, and this will have to be allowed
for.</p>
<p>Only a small fragment of his own culture is directly visible to any
of its adherents. Large parts of it are altogether buried in books,
paintings, musical scores, etc., which remain mostly unread, unseen,
unperformed. The messages of these records live, even in the minds best
informed about them, only in their awareness of having access to them
and of being able to evoke their voices and understand them. And this
leads us back to the fact, implied in describing science as superior
knowledge, that all these immense systematic accumulations of articulate
forms consist of the records of human affirmations. They are the
utterances of prophets, poets, legislators, scientists and other
masters, or the messages of men who, by their actions, recorded in
history, have set a pattern for posterity; to which are added the living
voices of contemporary cultural leaders, competing for the allegiance of
the public. Thus we may regard, in the last analysis, the entire
superior knowledge embodied in a modern highly articulate culture as the
sum total of what its classics have uttered and its heroes and saints
have done. If we belong to this culture then these are our great men:
men to whose superiority we entrust ourselves, by trying to understand
their works and to follow their teachings and examples. Our adherence to
the common beliefs and standards on which intellectual exchanges within
a culture depend, appears then equivalent to our adherence to the same
masters as fountains of authority. They are our intellectual ancestry:
‘the famous men and fathers who begat us’ in whose heritage we
enter.</p>
<p>It follows, therefore, that a dialogue between equals within a
complex culture acknowledges a further (fifth) grade of knowledge, not
appraised critically by those who recognize it, but accepted by them
largely unseen, on the authority of those whom they believe to possess
it. When referring to such superior knowledge we are not laying down
standards for judging the persons to whom we attribute this knowledge;
we are submitting, on the contrary, to the standards laid down by them
for our own guidance.</p>
<p>In the chapter on Conviviality I have distinguished the following
types of societies, characterized by their relation to thought. (1)
Pre-modern static societies which recognize thought as an independent
force, but only as embodied in a specific orthodoxy; we may call them
authoritarian. (2) Modern dynamic societies which are either (a) free,
if they acknowledge thought as an independent force or (b) totalitarian,
if they deny this independence in principle. A free society differs from
a static, authoritarian, society by accepting a wide range of rival
thoughts for its guidance. Its members share the bulk of their heroes
and masters, but may disagree in respect of some of them. A totalitarian
society differs both from a free and an authoritarian society by
inverting in principle the relation between power and thought; I have
explained the principles of this inversion in the chapter on
Conviviality.</p>
<p>What I have said so far about superior knowledge referred in the main
to its position in a free society; what follows now shall acknowledge
expressly my allegiance to such a society. I shall speak of its heroes
and masters, who are also my own heroes and masters, and shall refer to
the liberal orthodoxy established by them in terms that are consistent
with the content of this orthodoxy, to which I myself subscribe.</p>
<p>Let me recall once more, for a start, that everything by which we
mentally surpass the animals is first evoked in us by learning to speak.
Mentally, we are called into being by accepting an idiom of thought. The
child accepts it almost passively. Yet from the masters of a free
society he learns a language which implicitly restricts the authority to
which he is submitting—not because of its occasional admonitions to
scepticism, but on the contrary, because it acknowledges the
universality of truth and other forms of excellence. The language of
these ideals, anchored in the works and lives of our masters, grants to
each one of us the right to uphold these ideals against any particular
utterance of these same masters. For it is not to their person, but to
what we understand to be their teaching, that we pledge ourselves. It is
indeed only by the lives of ordinary men within a free society that the
principles to which it is dedicated acquire their effective meaning. The
superior knowledge guiding a free society is formulated by its great men
and embodied in its tradition.</p>
<p>Such is man’s relation to his ideals: he can know them only by freely
following them. This has been said before in the chapter on Commitment.
Let me substantiate it once more here by recalling the various scattered
references made in this book to the ideals of a free society. In the
chapter on Intellectual Passions I have shown how the values of science
are rooted in the work of great scientists, and how our aesthetic
sensibilities are developed likewise by the masters of music and
painting. In ‘Conviviality’ I have spoken of the moral passions which
inspire our modern political dynamism, and in ‘The Critique of Doubt’ I
gave some evidence of the deepening and purification of religious
passions in our time. In ‘Commitment’ I spoke of the sustained passion
for justice which has eventually secured the independence of law courts,
and in the present chapter I have shown how our appreciation of living
beings and their various achievements are sustained by biology.</p>
<p>These brief texts can serve only as pointers towards this limitless
subject matter: the kinds of excellence to which our great men have
testified is inexhaustible and no attempt can be made in this book even
to classify them. Yet we must now try to bring this whole domain of
superior knowledge into focus as an overlapping of our ascending
biological survey with the extension of our previous epistemological
enquiry. The framework of commitment, by which I have stabilized my
personal knowledge of facts, must be capable of justifying also—by a
suitable generalization of its terms—my adherence to the beliefs and
standards which underlie the culture of a free society, and this result
should fall into line with an extension of biology to the study of great
men.</p>
<p>I shall arrive at this confluence of ultra-biology with the upholding
of human ideals by a further pursuit of my ascending biological survey
accompanied by a running critique of biology. Remember how biology rises
from the appraisal of primordial, vegetative, commitments, to the
appraisal of primitive, active-perceptive, commitments and then, by the
study of animal learning, to the appraisal of commitments entered on
intelligently and with universal intent. We start by observing a living
body with a primordial centre of individuality, and are led on by a
continuous progression to a situation in which we face a subject
committing himself deliberately to the solution of an external problem.
And as we rise stage by stage from morphology to animal psychology, our
convivial participation in the living organism becomes increasingly
richer, more intimate and less unequal. So, arriving finally at the
study of human thought, conviviality becomes mutual. A conscious,
responsible person—the biologist—is now appraising the achievements of
another person of the same rank, whose thoughts can claim respect on the
same grounds as his own. It is the reference to these grounds that
inevitably expands the dialogue of two responsible human beings into an
acknowledgment of a knowledge that is superior to their own: the
superior knowledge of their culture, as mediated by the great men who
are the founders and exemplifiers of that culture. A dialogue can be
sustained only if both participants belong to a community accepting on
the whole the same teaching and tradition for judging their own
affirmations. A responsible encounter presupposes a common firmament of
superior knowledge.</p>
<p>In the course of this progression our convivial passions undergo a
fundamental development. Our love of harmonious being makes us study
living shapes; our pleasure in the ingenuity of living functions upholds
embryology and physiology; our love of animals sustains the study of
their behaviour; and as we finally ascend to human companionship, we
necessarily arrive also beyond it, by finding a spiritual home in the
society on which this companionship is grounded. Thus the mental life
developing between two equal human beings necessarily includes an
emotional relation to the whole galaxy of their common superiors. The
riches of mental companionship between two equals can be released only
if they share a convivial passion for others greater than themselves,
within a like-minded community—the partners must belong to each other by
participating in a reverence for a common superior knowledge.</p>
<p>We can now appreciate also the changes in the logical structure of
the convivial relations along the line of this progression. The feelings
by which we appreciate the achievements of beings lower than ourselves,
involve an extension of ourselves by which we participate in their
achievements. But though the naturalist is inspired by the love of
nature, and all biology derives its interest ultimately from the
fascination exercised on us by living beings, even the most passionate
animal lover receives no instruction from his pet. Only as the
biologist’s participation rises to the level of human companionship,
does it become distinctly self-modifying and thus eventually loses
altogether its observational character, to become a condition of pure
indwelling. The decisive break occurs when we accept another person’s
superior knowledge. By applying his thoughts or deeds as our standards
for judging the rightness of our own thoughts and deeds, we surrender
our person for the sake of becoming more satisfying to ourselves in the
light of these standards. This act is irreversible and also a-critical,
since we cannot judge the rightness of our standards in the sense in
which we judge other things in the light of these standards. At this
point the three-levelled structure of biology proper gives way (as I
foreshadowed at the close of the previous chapter) to a two-levelled
structure. But these are not the same two levels on which the
observation of inanimate nature takes place, with the observer occupying
the higher plane. The three levels which had emerged from these original
two levels by the extension of our attention to active beings centred on
themselves, have been replaced now by two levels representing the
outlook of man centring on things higher than himself. He may be said to
stand on the lower level of this commitment. Alternatively, we may
describe him as forming the personal pole of a commitment of which the
ideals of man form the universal pole.</p>
