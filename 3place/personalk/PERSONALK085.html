<h4 id="agnostic-doubt-in-courts-of-law">6. AGNOSTIC DOUBT IN COURTS OF
LAW</h4>
<p>The procedure of the law courts prescribes the observance of strictly
impartial agnostic doubt in respect to a specified range of topics.
There are a number of matters which would normally be considered
relevant to a criminal charge, into which the court may not enquire. If
a man, having just witnessed a murder, described it to a party of people
and later collapsed and died, the murderer might go scot free without
any member of the party being allowed to report in court what the man
who witnessed the deed had told him. Much other information, for example
evidence concerning the character of the accused, that would normally be
relevant, may not be raised by the prosecution. If any information
excluded from judicial notice is inadvertently brought up, the jury are
directed to forget it. By the enforcement of such rules which restrict
the usual range of interest to which the members of the court would
respond in connection with the case before them, the law succeeds in
keeping out of their minds a certain number of allegations p and their
contradictories not-p which they would otherwise entertain. By
suppressing the voicing of either of these alternatives the law hopes to
achieve a strictly agnostic attitude in respect to them. This is
equivalent to the establishment of the first half of agnostic doubt in
respect to the p’s in question, without any subsequent decision as to
the credibility of these p’s. In such a case the range of beliefs
entertained is effectively reduced, but only to the extent to which we
are prevented from knowing of the matters to which they refer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the questions relevant to the issue which are
admitted in court must be decided one way or another. If, after the
evidence is exhausted it is found that both p and not-p are consistent
with it, the presumptions laid down by law decide in favour of one of
the two alternatives. The most widely known legal presumptions are
perhaps those which grant the benefit of the doubt to the accused in
criminal proceedings. If the allegations p and not-p are both consistent
with the evidence, the court will as a rule presume—i.e. believe—the
alternative which does not prejudice the innocence of the accused. But
there is no sweeping presumption in this respect. In the absence of
proof to the contrary an accused is presumed sane although this tells
against him. There are numerous legal presumptions of a particular kind
which prevail both in civil and criminal suits and bear no relation to
the distinction between the two contesting sides. Such presumptions
serve largely to avoid deadlock and to decide as reasonably as possible
important issues for which there is no evidence that would be normally
regarded as adequate. The judge will find for example that, of a married
couple who were drowned together, the older one will have died first,
even though he knows nothing whatever about it.</p>
<p>To take into consideration any matter which the court must not
notice, or to form beliefs that are contrary to the proper legal
presumptions, or quite generally, to form any legally unreasonable
beliefs, is condemned as bias or caprice. In so far as these rules
exclude the forming of certain beliefs to which we would normally be
prone, they enforce a doubt or a state of agnosticism in respect to
these beliefs. But once more, as in the scientific interpretation of
experience, the system of beliefs which displaces here the beliefs of
the man-in-the-street is no less definite and comprehensive than that
which would be held otherwise. The law which orders that a man be
presumed innocent until he is found guilty, does not impose an open mind
on the court, but tells it on the contrary what to believe at the start:
namely that the man is innocent. Even the legal exclusion of normally
relevant matter may be interpreted as the prescription of specific
beliefs, namely that they are in fact irrelevant to the issue. In all
these respects the supposedly open mind of an unbiassed court can be
sustained only by a much stronger will to believe than the usual beliefs
of a person discharging no judicial responsibility. The former beliefs
are much less plausible than the latter, and to this extent they may be
said to be dogmatically imposed for the occasion. This seems to have
been one of the reasons why Western observers were at first inclined to
take lightly the patent omission of legal safeguards in the Moscow
trials. Proper legal procedure does not appeal to common sense.</p>
<p>The dogmatic and often arbitrary character of legally imposed beliefs
is justified by the peculiar context in which they are established and
affirmed. The court does not try to find out the truth about certain
interesting events, but only to find—by a legally prescribed
procedure—the facts relevant to a certain legal issue. The will to
believe these affirmations, even when they are not justifiable in
themselves, originates in the will to do justice by making these
affirmations and acting upon them. There is therefore, strictly
speaking, no possible contradiction between the factual findings of a
court of law and those of scientific and ordinary experience. They
by-pass each other. The relation between observed facts and legal facts
is similar in principle to that between factual experience and an art
based on such experience, or between empirical facts and mathematical
conceptions. In all these cases experience serves as a theme for an
intellectual activity which develops one aspect of it into a system that
is established and accepted on the grounds of its internal evidence. The
system of legal facts is accepted as part of a social life shaped by the
corresponding legal framework.</p>
