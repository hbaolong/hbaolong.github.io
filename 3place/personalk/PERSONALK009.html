<h4 id="probability-statements">3. PROBABILITY STATEMENTS</h4>
<p>Yet the theories of classical physics differ from all other chapters
in the domain of science by the fact that events are conceivable which
would strictly falsify them. It is conceivable, for example, that a sun
with a planet circling around it might be so far removed from other
celestial bodies as to render negligible any perturbations caused by
these, and that we should know this to be the case. Assuming further,
for the sake of argument, that we could observe the position of the
planet exactly at successive moments of time, the formulae of mechanics
would acquire the power of making quite impersonal predictions, which
would be strictly falsified by the fact that the planet failed to turn
up in any predicted position at a predicted time. A finite deviation,
however slight, would entail a complete refutation of the theory.</p>
<p>By such assumptions as the above we may succeed in restoring at least
fictionally the conception of impersonal knowledge in classical
mechanics. But the pretences of any such claim become altogether
transparent if we pass on to statements of probability. Probability
statements can never be strictly contradicted by experience, even if we
assume that all external perturbations and all observational errors are
entirely eliminated. The only difficulty in demonstrating this fact is
that it is so obvious for nobody will be ready to believe that the
matter is so simple, when so many volumes have been written around it
without clearly saying so.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate the point by the example of a hydrogen atom as
described by quantum mechanics. It presents us with a map which assigns
to every point of infinite space a number which is a function f (r) of
its distance r from the nucleus. This number denotes the probability of
finding the electron of the hydrogen atom at this particular point and
likewise at any other point having the same distance r from the nucleus.
The simple reason why this statement cannot be contradicted by any
conceivable event lies in the fact that it admits that the electron may
be found or not be found at the designated place on the specified
occasion. There is a story of a dog-owner who prided himself on the
perfect training of his pet. Whenever he called: ‘Here! will you come or
not!’ the dog invariably either came or not. That is exactly how
electrons behave when controlled by probability.</p>
<p>Statements of this kind are essentially ambiguous and may therefore
seem to say nothing. However, if there is, as I believe that there is,
some meaning in assigning a numerical value to the probability of our
finding an electron at a certain place on a particular occasion, such an
assignment must imply some restriction on this ambiguity; and if no
strictly objective restriction can be derived from the assignment of
this probability, we may expect to find in it instead some guidance to
our personal participation in the event to which the probability
statement refers.</p>
<p>It is indeed easy to recognize in principle our participation in
chance events if we relax for a moment our objectivist sophistication
and revert to ordinary usage. We commonly describe certain events as
remarkable coincidences; we have our stories of memorable pieces of luck
or ill-luck. These are appraisals of events governed by chance. We make
such appraisals both before and after such an event has taken place, and
if their probability is expressed numerically, this number guides and
largely expresses our appraisal. If I accept the probability statement
that the chances of throwing three double sixes in immediate succession
are one in 46656, I shall entertain a correspondingly small expectation
of doing so; while if it should still happen, I shall be surprised, to a
degree corresponding to the reciprocal of this numerical probability.
Such is my participation in the event to which a probability statement
refers, and this I regard as the proper meaning of its probability.</p>
<p>This is not to ascribe a subjective meaning to the probability of an
event—either in the laws of quantum mechanics or in the statement that
the chances of throwing a double six are 1/36. I ascribe universal
validity to my appraisals of probability, in spite of the fact that they
make no predictions which could be contradicted by any conceivable
events. I shall mention in the next chapter a wide range of universally
valid appraisals within the exact sciences which are all essentially
incapable of being contradicted by any conceivable event.</p>
<p>There is, of course, an important sense in which a probability
statement can be controverted (though not contradicted) by the events.
If the expectations based on a statement of probability are repeatedly
disappointed and the ensuing events appear to have been correspondingly
improbable in the light of the anterior statement of their probability,
we shall begin to suspect the correctness of this statement. The process
of deciding that a certain statistical statement is untenable has indeed
been systematically developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in his famous
treatise, The Design of Experiments.</p>
<p>I shall give a brief outline of Fisher’s standard example for the
application of this procedure, dealing with Charles Darwin’s experiments
on the influence of cross-fertilization in contrast to
self-fertilization on the height of plants.4 15 plants of each kind were
measured and 15 pairs formed at random from which 15 differences in
height (measured in eighths of an inch) were obtained. The differences
being denoted by X1, X2, X3. . ., their mean is . The value of, shows
that on the average the cross-fertilized plants were 20.93 eighths of an
inch taller than the self-fertilized plants. The heart of the question
is then whether this difference is significant or due to mere chance. To
decide this, we shall have to compare the magnitude of this difference
with the range of accidental variations which appear to occur in our
sample, and will be acknowledged as significant only if it sufficiently
exceeds the range of such variations. Technically, we describe this
range by a magnitude called the standard deviation σ which is computed
by forming the sum of the square of the deviations from the mean,
dividing this (in the case of 15 observations) first by 14 and then by
15, and taking the square root of the result, so that</p>
<p>In our case σ comes out at 9.746 eighth inches. Thus it is
immediately apparent that is larger than the standard deviation of the
individual heights. But the question still remains whether it is
sufficiently larger than σ to be incapable of being accounted for by
chance variations of heights.</p>
<p>To answer this question is to bring a statement of probability to the
test of experience. Let us watch how Fisher proceeds to do this. He
forms the ratio which comes out to 2.148; then he consults a table which
tells what the probability is for t to have any particular value when
based on 14 independent discrepancies, and finds that t = 2.148 is
reached or exceeded by chance in exactly 5 per cent of such random
trials.</p>
<p>This tells us that on the hypothesis (which Fisher calls the
null-hypothesis) that the differences in the heights of self-fertilized
and cross-fertilized plants are purely accidental, the probability for
our actually observed sample having occurred was less than 5 per cent.
Such a statement entitles us to be surprised by the observed result to
the same extent as we would be if we drew a black ball from a sack
supposed to contain only 5 black balls in a hundred otherwise
undistinguishable balls. Now suppose that we had ourselves placed the
balls, 95 per cent of them white and 5 per cent of them black, into the
sack, and then having shaken them up, we drew out a black ball. We
should be very surprised, yet remain unshaken in our belief that the bag
contained the balls we had put into it. Not so, however, for our
null-hypothesis, In this case Sir Ronald Fisher suggests (and I am
prepared to follow him) that we must abandon the assumption that
cross-fertilization as against self-fertilization has no effect on the
height of plants, since the probability of Darwin’s results, being less
than 5 per cent, renders the assumption untenable.</p>
<p>Indeed, we may accept Fisher’s recommendation of a standard procedure
for disproving a null-hypothesis, based on the exclusion of
probabilities that are less than 5 per cent. But it is already apparent
that this procedure can apply only to hypothetical assumptions that we
consider to be of a likelihood comparable to that of the ineffectiveness
of cross-fertilization as against self-fertilization, and not to
assumptions of such a high degree of likelihood as we would hold in
respect of the continued presence in a bag of the black and white balls
which we placed in it.</p>
<p>Of course, a series of actual results of sufficiently low probability
might shake our initial assumptions even when they are most firmly held.
Thus the card-guessing experiments of Rhine in the U.S. and of Soal in
England have rendered untenable to these observers and their followers
the null-hypothesis that in these experiments the card to be guessed had
no effect on the guessing of it. But in these cases the probabilities of
the observed results as evaluated on the basis of the null-hypothesis
had to fall very far below 5 per cent in order to shake one’s belief in
it. There is of course no finite limit to the confidence we may
reasonably place in a null-hypothesis, nor can there be therefore any
definite lower limit either to the probability of events which we may
assume to have occurred on the basis of some null-hypothesis. Hence it
is clear that a probability statement cannot be strictly contradicted by
any event, however improbable this event may appear in its light. The
contradiction must be established by a personal act of appraisal which
rejects certain possibilities as being too improbable to be entertained
as true.</p>
