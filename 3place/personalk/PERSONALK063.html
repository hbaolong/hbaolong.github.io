<h4 id="spurious-forms-of-moral-inversion">12. SPURIOUS FORMS OF MORAL
INVERSION</h4>
<p>We must guard also against assuming that a materialistic
interpretation of moral motives must always result in moral inversion.
Far from it. Spurious forms of moral inversion are quite common. Men may
go on talking the language of positivism, pragmatism, and naturalism for
many years, yet continue to respect the principles of truth and morality
which their vocabulary anxiously ignores.</p>
<p>Take for example the text of Freud, in which he interprets culture in
the light of his psychology.32 Towards the end he writes emphatically:
This alone I know with certainty, namely that man’s value judgments are
guided absolutely by their desire for happiness, and are therefore
merely an attempt to bolster up their illusions by arguments.’33 But at
the opening of the same essay he had expressed his deep respect for
Romain Rolland, for spurning the false standards commonly applied by men
who seek power, success and wealth, and who admire these achievements in
others, while they fail to appreciate the true values of life;34 and
again at another point he had declared himself for the ideal of a
generous society in which ‘all work together for the happiness of
all’.35</p>
<p>We can see the dynamo-objective coupling operating here on the same
lines as in Marxism. A utilitarian interpretation of morality accuses
all moral sentiments of hypocrisy, while the moral indignation which the
writer thus expresses is safely disguised as a scientific statement. And
on other occasions, these concealed moral passions reassert themselves,
affirming ethical ideals either backhandedly as a tight-lipped praise of
social dissenters, or else disguised in utilitarian terms.</p>
<p>This prevarication of the critical mind in its encounter with
morality can be traced back to antiquity. Thucydides records unwittingly
how the Athenians at one moment affirm that there is only one law of God
and man which is ‘to rule wherever one can’; how they sneer at the
hypocrisy of the Spartans who likewise pursue their self-interest, but
cloak it with the mantle of justice and honour—while at the next moment
the same Athenians draw a sharp contrast between the path of
self-interest which leads to safety, and the path of justice and honour
which involves danger. Pitifully groping for tangible terms, the great
Athenian’s love of Athens’ greatness falls back (in the Funeral Oration)
on vaunting the unrivalled size of its enterprises.</p>
<p>Since the eighteenth century we have again seen many hardened
utilitarians nobly upholding their logically unaccountable moral
convictions—but only in the twentieth century has popular thought been
permeated by this internal contradiction. Today our moral judgments are
quite generally without theoretical protection. They may disguise
themselves as a sociology of ‘aggressiveness’ or ‘competitiveness’ or of
‘social stability’, etc., and may advocate in these terms more kindness,
generosity, tolerance, and brotherhood among men. The public, taught by
the sociologist to distrust its traditional morality, is grateful to
receive it back from him in a scientifically branded wrapping. Indeed, a
writer who has proved his hard-headed perspicacity by denying the
existence of morality will always be listened to with especial respect
when he does moralize in spite of this. Thus the scientific disguise of
our moral aspirations may not only protect their substance against
destruction by nihilism, but even allow them to operate effectively by
stealth. This is how great reformers like Bentham or Dewey have been
able to use their utilitarianism for moral purposes.</p>
<p>To recognize the existence of moral inversion is to acknowledge moral
forces as primary motives of man; it is to deny that ‘sublimation’
underlies (as Freud thought) the creation of culture. Of course, moral
forces are elicited and shaped by education, even as man’s intelligence
or artistic talent is evoked by education. But this does not imply that
morality is a mere rationalization of self-interest, or that science is
a ‘sublimation’ of sexual curiosity. On the contrary, the Freudian
interpretation of morality is itself but a spurious form of moral
inversion. It forms part of the expurgation of modern language which
substitutes objectivist—and preferably appetitive—terms for candidly
moral ones.</p>
<p>But it is dangerous to rely on it that men will continue indefinitely
to pursue their moral ideals within a system of thought which denies
reality to them. Not because they might lose their ideals—which is rare,
and usually without serious public consequence—but because they might
slip into the logically stabler state of complete moral inversion. For
the objectivist masquerade can go on only so long as the moral
convictions whose internal instability it bolsters up, remain
comparatively peaceable. A great upsurge of moral demands on social
life, such as arose at the end of the eighteenth century and has since
flooded the whole world, must seek a more forcible expression. When
injected into a utilitarian framework it transmutes both itself and this
framework. It turns into the fanatical force of a machinery of violence.
This is how moral inversion is completed: man masked as a beast turns
into a Minotaur.</p>
