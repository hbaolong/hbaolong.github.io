<h4 id="the-law-of-chemical-proportions">3. THE LAW OF CHEMICAL
PROPORTIONS</h4>
<p>The comparison of pebbles with living beings has shown us that our
appreciation of order includes an appraisal of the degree of order. I
shall illustrate this now within the exact sciences by our knowledge of
the chemical composition of compounds and afterwards, even mote
emphatically, by our appreciation of the symmetry of crystals.</p>
<p>Everyone knows of the law of simple chemical proportions and can
understand a simple chemical formula. If the composition of chloroform
is denoted by CHCl3, this means that it consists of one part of carbon
measured in units of 12 grams, one part of hydrogen measured in units of
about I gram and three parts of chlorine measured in units of 35.5
grams. These units of weight, which differ from element to element, are
called the atomic weights of the elements. Once these units are adopted,
every combination of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine can be written down
in similar simple forms, like CH3Cl for methylchloride, CH2Cl2 for
methylene dichloride, and so on.</p>
<p>This seems quite straightforward, yet this theory makes a claim which
relies in a peculiar way on acts of personal appraisal—far more heavily
so than classical mechanics, which can be verified with a minimum of
personal participation on the part of the observer. The chemical
formulae which I have quoted assert that the composition of the
compounds in question is represented (when measured in appropriate
units) by such ratios as 1 : 1 : 3; or 1 : 3 : 1; or 1 : 2 : 2. To
ascertain a simple proportion of integers from a measurement of weights
demands that we go beyond the method of ascertaining measured quantities
from sets of instrument readings, as we do for the verification of
predictions in classical dynamics. We must take the further step of
identifying arithmetical proportions of measured quantities with integer
fractions. The transition from sets of instrument readings to numbers
accepted as measured can be formalized up to a point by the assumption
of random errors to account for the spread of instrument readings; but
there is no formal rule for ascertaining the integer fractions
corresponding to any particular proportion of measured numbers.</p>
<p>The step from measured data to integer relations is rendered
indeterminate by the inevitably implied demand that the integers be
small. We may consider it obvious that if the ratio of the measured
proportions of carbon to hydrogen in a sample of chloroform and a sample
of methylene dichloride comes out at 0.504 with a probable error of
±0.04, we should take it that the ratio is to be represented by the
integer fraction 1/2; but this is only so because we readily assume that
the ratio must be simple, i.e. made up of small integers. Much closer
approximations would be offered, of course, by taking the ratios of
larger integers. By choosing from these we could always achieve a
perfect fit, as we would by taking 1008 : 2000 to represent the measured
ratio 0.504.</p>
<p>It is indeed meaningless to speak of establishing a correspondence
between measured quantities and integers unless the condition is
included that the integers should be small and their fractions simple.
In accepting as significant a law of nature like that of simple chemical
proportions, we claim that we can evaluate observed magnitudes in terms
of simple integer fractions.</p>
<p>Note the word ‘simple’! To the extent to which the attribute of
simplicity is vague, the demands which a law of simple proportions makes
on experience are indeterminate. If future observations of chemical
proportions could be represented only by larger integers than those
found apposite to previously analysed compounds, we might feel
increasingly disappointed in the theory and be eventually altogether
discouraged from relying on it. But the process would resemble more
closely the gradual relinquishing of a supposed statistical law which
has repeatedly failed to find corroboration, than the rejection of an
unambiguous theory which has met with a series of conflicting
observations.</p>
<p>It is true that the chemical analysis of a substance with a high
molecular weight may lead to proportions described by large integers.
The end-group of a long chain of carbon atoms may be formed by some
element X, so that the proportion of X to carbon and hydrogen as well
(measured in atomic weight units) may be 1 : 1000 or even higher. When a
chemical analysis is interpreted in these terms we no longer rely on the
law of simple proportions, but on the atomic theory which has come to
replace it as the conceptual framework of chemistry. Atoms can be
counted, and their counting would necessarily lead to integer
proportions of chemical compounds. Proportions obtained by counting are
observed integer fractions which need not be simple. Indeed, if we could
count the number of sodium and chlorine particles in a crystal of rock
salt, we would find a slight excess of one or the other kind of
particles and the proportion of the two would be something like
1,000,000,000: 1,000,000,001. We may say quite generally that chemical
proportions which cannot be expressed by small integers may nevertheless
be interpreted as integer proportions if this appears justified by more
direct evidence concerning the atomic structure of the analysed
substances.</p>
<p>But we must remember that the laws of simple chemical proportions
were established, or at least strongly urged, before the atomic theory
was invoked for their explanation. By the time John Dalton’s atomic
theory was taking shape, the German Richter had stated this law for the
combination of acids and bases, and the Frenchman Proust was about to
overcome the opposition of his compatriot Berthollet in an attempt to
extend these laws to certain metal compounds. It would seem that by
1808, well before Dalton’s ideas became known in France, Proust had
convincingly established this claim for copper carbonate, the two oxides
of tin and the sulphides of iron. Dalton’s discovery of the atomic
theory was itself based on the evidence of simple chemical proportions
and thus confirmed the intimations of reality contained in the appraisal
of this orderly pattern. He is quoted as saying that ‘the doctrine of
definite proportions appears mysterious unless we adopt the atomic
hypothesis’. It appears, he said, like the mystical ratios of Kepler
which Newton so happily elucidated.8</p>
<p>As time went on the significance of this orderly pattern was even
more richly revealed. Dalton’s atom proved a mere shadowy prefiguration
of its successor, the atom of Rutherford and Bohr. Once more it was
proved—and this time on a vast scale—that a scientific theory, when it
conforms to reality, gets hold of a truth that is far deeper than its
author’s understanding of it.9</p>
<p>The difficulty of establishing an integer character of a magnitude
from any measurements of it may be illustrated by an example in which
this process is still sharply controversial. Eddington had deduced that
the reciprocal of the ‘fine structure constant’ which in the usual
symbols has the formula is equal to the integer 137. When Eddington’s
assertion was originally made, the value computed from observation was
137.307, with a probable error ± 0.048, which seemed to contradict his
assertion. However, the accepted experimental value has changed in the
last 20 years and is now 137.009.10 Yet this close agreement between
theory and observation is considered fortuitous by the overwhelming
majority of physicists. It is merely a source of annoyance to them.</p>
