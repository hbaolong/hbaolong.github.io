<h4 id="implicit-beliefs">8. IMPLICIT BELIEFS</h4>
<p>The limitations of doubting as a principle can be elaborated further
by extending our enquiry to the beliefs held in the form of our
conceptual framework, as expressed in our language. Our most deeply
ingrained convictions are determined by the idiom in which we interpret
our experience and in terms of which we erect our articulate systems.18
Our formally declared beliefs can be held to be true in the last resort
only because of our logically anterior acceptance of a particular set of
terms, from which all our references to reality are constructed.</p>
<p>The fact that primitive people hold distinctive systems of beliefs
inherent in their conceptual framework and reflected in their language
was first stated with emphasis by Lévy-Brühl earlier in this century.
The more recent work of Evans-Pritchard on the beliefs of Azande19 has
borne out and has given further precision to this view. The author is
struck by the intellectual force shown by the primitive African in
upholding his beliefs against evidence which to the European seems
flagrantly to refute them. An instance in point is the Zande belief in
the powers of the poison-oracle. The oracle answers questions through
the effects on a fowl of a poisonous substance called benge. The
oracle-poison is extracted from a creeper gathered in a traditional
manner, which is supposed to become effective only after it has been
addressed in the words of an appropriate ritual. Azande—we are told—have
no formal and coercive doctrine to enforce belief in witch-doctors and
their practice of the poison-oracle, but their belief in these is the
more firmly held for being embedded in an idiom which interprets all
relevant facts in terms of witchcraft and oracular powers.
Evans-Pritchard gives various examples of this peculiar tenacity of
their implicit belief.</p>
<p>Suppose that the oracle in answer to a particular question says
‘Yes’, and immediately afterwards says ‘No’ to the same question. In our
eyes this would tend to discredit the oracle altogether, but Zande
culture provides a number of ready explanations for such
self-contradictions. Evans-Pritchard lists no less than eight secondary
elaborations of their beliefs by which Azande will account for the
oracle’s failure. They may assume that the wrong variety of poison had
been gathered, or a breach of taboo committed, or that the owners of the
forest where the poisonous creeper grows had been angered and avenged
themselves by spoiling the poison; and so on.</p>
<p>Our author describes further the manner in which Azande resist any
suggestion that benge may be a natural poison. He often asked Azande, he
tells us, what would happen if they were to administer oracle-poison to
a fowl without delivering an address, or if they were to administer an
extra portion of poison to a fowl which has recovered from the usual
doses. ‘The Zande’—he continues—’does not know what would happen and is
not interested in what would happen; no one has been fool enough to
waste good oracle-poison in making such pointless experiments which only
a European could imagine. . . . Were a European to make a test which in
his view proved Zande opinion wrong they would stand amazed at the
credulity of the European. If the fowl died they would simply say that
it was not good benge. The very fact of the fowl dying proves to them
its badness.’20</p>
<p>This blindness of Azande to the facts which to us seem decisive is
sustained by remarkable ingenuity. ‘They reason excellently in the idiom
of their beliefs,’ (says Evans-Pritchard), ’but they cannot reason
outside, or against, their beliefs because they have no other idiom in
which to express their thoughts.’21</p>
<p>Our objectivism, which tolerates no open declaration of faith, has
forced modern beliefs to take on implicit forms, like those of Azande.
And no one will deny that those who have mastered the idioms in which
these beliefs are entailed do also reason most ingeniously within these
idioms, even while—again like Azande—they unhesitatingly ignore all that
the idiom does not cover. I shall quote two passages to illustrate the
high stability of two modern interpretative frameworks, based on these
principles:</p>
<p>My party education had equipped my mind with such elaborate
shockabsorbing buffers and elastic defences that everything seen and
heard became automatically transformed to fit a preconceived pattern.
(A. Koestler, in The God that Failed, London, 1950, p. 68.)</p>
<p>The system of theories which Freud has gradually developed is so
consistent that when one is once entrenched in them it is difficult to
make observations unbiased by his way of thinking. (Karen Horney, New
Ways of Psychoanalysis, London, 1939, p. 7.)</p>
<p>The first of these statements is by a former Marxist, the second by a
former Freudian writer. At the time when they still accepted as valid
the conceptual framework of Marx or of Freud—as the case may be—these
writers would have regarded the all-embracing interpretative powers of
this framework as evidence of its truth; only when losing faith in it
did they feel that its powers were excessive and specious. We shall sec
the same difference reappear in our appraisals of the interpretative
power of different conceptual systems, as part of our acceptance or
rejection of these systems.</p>
