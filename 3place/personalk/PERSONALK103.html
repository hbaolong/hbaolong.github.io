<h4 id="logic-and-psychology">4. LOGIC AND PSYCHOLOGY</h4>
<p>In so far as the deductive sciences consist in formalized operations,
they can be embodied in the operational principles of computing
machines; and the body of an animal also functions to a certain extent
as a machine. Our enquiry into the logic of machines is, therefore,
capable of generalization over a domain extending from mathematics to
physiology. And we may add to this domain, as further rules of
rightness, the principles of ethics and law. My enquiry can attend to
these codes of human behaviour only in passing; while logic and
mathematics as forms of knowledge, and the machine-like structure of
animals—both as an object of natural science and as an instrument by
which animals may achieve knowledge—will retain our full attention.2</p>
<p>Everything that I have said concerning the relation of machines to
the laws of physics and chemistry, applies also to a digital computer
that is operated as a machine of logical inference.3 Here are some of
the relevant points. The operational principles of logical machines are
rules of rightness which can account only for success. These principles
are dissolved altogether, and with them the difference between success
and failure, in a physico-chemical topography of a machine. But physics
and chemistry are highly illuminating when used subsidiarily, with a
bearing on the previously established operational structure of logical
machines, so as to define the material conditions under which they can
work and to account for their occasional failures.</p>
<p>We can now define in similar terms the relation between logic and
psychology, though for dealing with this subject our terms will have to
be somewhat expanded. Thought proceeds largely by an irreversible
process of comprehension and not according to specifiable rules. Only
the latter will be called logical thinking, in which I shall include
mathematics. Logic, thus defined, is a rule of rightness: it tells us
how we must reason in order to derive correct and ample conclusions from
given premisses. When I listen to another person’s argument I appraise
it in relation to the standards of correctness which I have set up by
acknowledging certain rules as the rules of logic. Piaget has made a
systematic series of such appraisals at successive stages in the mental
development of children. His epistémologie génétique shows that the
child’s reasoning fulfils year by year ever higher standards of logical
performance.4 We may say that in his efforts to reason rightly the child
strives towards the fulfilment of these logical standards. And we may
add that by accepting these as obligatory he lays them down as
universally valid. The fact that he will argue in terms of these rules
shows that he holds them with persuasive intent. Thus the child’s
growing logical coherence appears as a progressive elaboration of his
commitment to logical rules of Rightness. He discovers, submits to,
relies on, and declares to be valid universally, ever higher standards
of logical excellence.</p>
<p>The operation of these rules of rightness takes place within the flow
of conscious and unconscious awareness which is the subject matter of
psychology. It may be set in motion by appetite or by intellectual
passion, and operates on a fund of memories. It may work by the powers
of the visual imagination, by the aid of verbal or other symbolism, or
altogether conceptually. It will be profoundly influenced by the
language and the conceptual framework in which the child was brought up.
But no study of this medium of thought can reveal whether a particular
deduction—for example a proof of the binomial theorem—is correct or not.
The correctness of such a proof can be supported only by logical
reasons, not by psychological observations. Psychology cannot
distinguish by itself between true and false inferences, and hence is
blind to logical principles; but it can throw light on the conditions
under which the understanding and operation of correct
logico-mathematical reasoning may develop, and it may supply an
explanation for errors in reasoning. Indeed, an error in reasoning can
never be the subject of a logical demonstration; it can be understood
only by psychological observations which reveal its causes. On the other
hand, it is meaningless to speak of the causes of a mathematical
theorem. We may enquire into the conditions which favoured its
discovery, but the validity of a theorem can only be justified by
reasons, not accounted for by causes.</p>
<p>The relation between the rules of logic and the subject matter of
psychology which I have just described is the same as that between the
operational principles of machines and the subject matters of physics
and chemistry, except for one additional feature—I have introduced a
second person striving to reason rightly, according to the rules of
logic. This active, responsible personal centre will emerge more fully
later. But we may anticipate this here: whatever rules of rightness a
person tries to fulfil and establish—be they moral, aesthetic or
legal—he commits himself to an ideal; and again, he can do so only
within a medium that is blind to this ideal. The ideal determines the
standards to which a person holds himself responsible; but the
ideal-blind medium both grants the possibility for striving for this
ideal and limits this possibility. It determines his calling.</p>
<p>At the other end of our line of generalization (which will be fully
set out in the next chapter) we have placed the organism functioning as
a machine. We may conclude straight away that in this respect an
organism is represented by operational principles of the kind which
define machines. Physiology is the technology of healthy achievements:
of wholesome feeding, good digestion, effective locomotion, sharp
perception, fertile copulation, etc. The argument could be pursued
further on now familiar lines. But I shall prefer to postpone this until
I have defined the machine-like features of an animal more precisely, by
contrast to its ‘organismic’ functions, which cannot be aptly formulated
in terms of definite operational principles.</p>
