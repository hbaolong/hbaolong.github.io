<h4 id="human-knowledge">8. HUMAN KNOWLEDGE</h4>
<p>But before arriving at this point we have yet to consider a previous
stage, at which we achieve equality between ourselves and the person
whose knowing we examine. This situation is of special interest, for it
is here that my biological acknowledgment of rising levels of personhood
comes to coincide—or nearly to coincide—with the position from which, at
the opening of this enquiry, I first envisaged the unfathomable range of
the scientific mind. Let me recall how this spectacle induced me to
undertake a systematic survey of the tacit coefficient of knowing, as it
ascends and broadens out from the primordial activity of the lowest
animals to the whole edifice of human thought in human society. As a
result of these reflections I have acknowledged my capacity, and my
calling, to pursue knowledge and to declare it responsibly, within my
own limited possibilities. Consider now how the critique of biology,
ascending from morphology to psychology, has shown that the knowing of
life entailed at all these levels an appreciation of biological
achievements by standards set to the organism by ourselves; and has
shown that a more detached manner of observing life would dissolve
altogether our knowledge of life. We can see then how the extension of
this progression to an examination of the knowledge of another person—of
a standing equal to our own—places us in a situation virtually identical
with that in which we reflected on our own knowledge in Parts One to
Three of this book.59 For if we agree with that which the other person
claims to know and with the grounds on which he relies for this
knowledge, the critical examination of this knowledge will become a
critical reflection on our own knowledge. Biology then comes to include
the accrediting of our own intellectual powers and the confirmation of
our commitments within the framework of our calling. It acknowledges, in
particular, our capacity for continually discovering new interpretations
of experience which reveal a deeper understanding of reality, and takes
us eventually to the point where the whole panorama of science unfolds
for a second time within a biology of man immersed in thought.</p>
<p>The significance of this confluence of an extended biology with the
theory of knowledge will soon become more fully apparent. I shall pause
here only in order to glance from this angle at some of the features of
human knowledge, already identified in our critique of science and of
other systematic interpretations of experience. We can identify in these
the four grades according to which we have classified reasonable action
and perception, as well as animal inference. We have</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Correct inferences reached within a true system.</p></li>
<li><p>Erroneous conclusions arrived at within a true system (like an
error committed by a competent scientist).</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusions arrived at by the correct use of a fallacious system.
This is an incompetent mode of reasoning, the results of which possess
subjective validity.60</p></li>
<li><p>Incoherence and obsessiveness as observed in the ideation of the
insane, particularly in schizophrenia. The morbid reasoning of sufferers
from systematic delusions should also be classed here, rather than under
(3), since such delusions impair the very core of a person’s
rationality.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These alternatives correspond to the appraisal of a commitment in two
stages, namely in respect of (a) its framework and (b) the application
of this framework. If we accredit both (a) and (b), we have case (1); if
(a) but not (b): case (2); if (b) and not (a): case (3). Our rejection
of both (a) and (b) defines the unimportant case that I have not listed,
when a false framework is applied erroneously, while case (4) is now
seen to represent the absence of any interpretative framework, whether
true or false.</p>
<p>These stages of knowing are of course all appraised by him who speaks
of them, on the assumption that he can judge their truth content,
critically. But we must take into account now, in addition to this
critical relation, the possibility of exchanges between the speaker and
the person whose claims he is assessing, i.e. the exchanges by which
they mutually question, inform, criticize and persuade each other.</p>
