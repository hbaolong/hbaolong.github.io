<h4 id="summary">10. SUMMARY</h4>
<p>Let me sum up my argument so far. I started with the exact sciences,
defining them as a mathematical formalism with a bearing on experience.
There appeared to be present a personal participation on the part of the
scientist in establishing this bearing on experience. This was least
noticeable in classical mechanics and I accordingly accepted that
chapter of physics as the closest approximation to a completely detached
natural science. Its statements could indeed be so formulated as to
admit of strict falsification by experience. There followed two sets of
examples for a more massive and not conceivably negligible personal
participation in the exact sciences. The first of these comprised the
knowledge of probabilities in science; and more particularly of the
degrees of coincidence involved in assuming that an apparently
significant pattern of events had come about as the result of chance.
The second set demonstrated the assessment of orderly patterns in the
exact sciences and showed that standards of orderliness, though bearing
on experience, cannot be conceivably falsified by it. On the contrary,
as in the case of statements of probability, they themselves appraise
any relevant samples of experience.</p>
<p>Experience can of course offer clues to encourage or disappoint
statements of probability or standards of order and this effect is
important, but not much more important than the factual theme of a novel
is for its acceptability. Yet personal knowledge in science is not made
but discovered, and as such it claims to establish contact with reality
beyond the clues on which it relies. It commits us, passionately and far
beyond our comprehension, to a vision of reality. Of this responsibility
we cannot divest ourselves by setting up objective criteria of
verifiability—or falsifiability, or testability, or what you will. For
we live in it as in the garment of our own skin. Like love, to which it
is akin, this commitment is a ‘shirt of flame’, blazing with passion
and, also like love, consumed by devotion to a universal demand. Such is
the true sense of objectivity in science, which I illustrated in my
first chapter. I called it the discovery of rationality in nature, a
name which was meant to say that the kind of order which the discoverer
claims to see in nature goes far beyond his understanding; so that his
triumph lies precisely in his foreknowledge of a host of yet hidden
implications which his discovery will reveal in later days to other
eyes.</p>
<p>My argument was clearly overflowing already at that stage into
domains far beyond the exact sciences. In this chapter I have pursued
the roots of personal knowledge towards its most primitive forms which
lie behind the operations of a scientific formalism. Tearing away the
paper screen of graphs, equations and computations, I have tried to lay
bare the inarticulate manifestations of intelligence by which we know
things in a purely personal manner. I have entered on an analysis of the
arts of skilful doing and skilful knowing, the exercise of which guides
and accredits the use of scientific formulae, and which ranges far
further afield, unassisted by any formalism, in shaping our fundamental
notions of most things which make our world.</p>
<p>Here, in the exercise of skill and the practice of connoisseurship,
the art of knowing is seen to involve an intentional change of being:
the pouring of ourselves into the subsidiary awareness of particulars,
which in the performance of skills are instrumental to a skilful
achievement, and which in the exercise of connoisseurship function as
the elements of the observed comprehensive whole. The skilful performer
is seen to be setting standards to himself and judging himself by them;
the connoisseur is seen valuing comprehensive entities in terms of a
standard set by him for their excellence. The elements of such, a
context, the hammer, the probe, the spoken word, all point beyond
themselves and are endowed with meaning in this context; and on the
other hand a comprehensive context itself, like dance, mathematics,
music, possesses intrinsic or existential meaning.</p>
<p>The arts of doing and knowing, the valuation and the understanding of
meanings, are thus seen to be only different aspects of the act of
extending our person into the subsidiary awareness of particulars which
compose a whole. The inherent structure of this fundamental act of
personal knowing makes us both necessarily participate in its shaping
and acknowledge its results with universal intent. This is the prototype
of intellectual commitment.</p>
<p>It is the act of commitment in its full structure that saves personal
knowledge from being merely subjective. Intellectual commitment is a
responsible decision, in submission to the compelling claims of what in
good conscience I conceive to be true. It is an act of hope, striving to
fulfil an obligation within a personal situation for which I am not
responsible and which therefore determines my calling. This hope and
this obligation are expressed in the universal intent of personal
knowledge. The sense in which this may be said to be the case will be
made more definite as I proceed further and it will be summed up at the
close of Part Three.</p>
