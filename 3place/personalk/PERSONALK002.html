<p>Mary Jo Nye</p>
<p>MICHAEL Polanyi’s Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical
Philosophy was first published in 1958. It is a classic work. Like other
classics, it is a book that is rooted in a specific historical period
and in the preoccupations of its author, but with themes that
reverberate beyond its original context and writer. It is not a classic
of philosophy, however, as judged by most professional philosophers,
against whom Personal Knowledge was meant to serve as provocation and
prophylactic. The range of its readers was perhaps unanticipated by
Polanyi. They spread across a broad spectrum in sociology and political
science, psychology, economics, theology, and education. Among his
themes that are frequently cited in recent literature are tacit
knowledge, levels of knowing, intuition, skills, and performance—none of
which usually figures in formal philosophy. Judging by citations in
journal literature, Personal Knowledge is read equally as a resource for
discussions of complexity theory, emergent systems, faith, and
values.</p>
<p>Polanyi’s original philosophical targets in Personal Knowledge were a
series of “isms” that constituted the core of mid-twentieth-century
philosophy of science. It is no wonder the book had a mostly hostile
reception in 1958. His philosophical targets included positivism,
pragmatism, conventionalism, reductionism, mechanism, materialism, and
determinism. In opposition to the mainstream in philosophy of science,
Polanyi argued that objective empiricism and rule-bound logic do not
successfully explain the essence of science. There is no codified
scientific method that successfully captures the nature of science as it
is actually practiced in everyday scientific life, because of what he
called the tacit component of scientific learning and achievement.</p>
<p>Nor, Polanyi argued, can philosophies of verification or
falsification satisfactorily justify the truthfulness of scientific
knowledge, because they fail to explain the logical gap between evidence
and theory, a gap discussed by earlier philosophers such as David Hume.1
Ultimately, for Polanyi, the achievement of scientific knowledge relies
on overcoming the gap between evidence and theory by a commitment of
belief on the part of the individual scientist and of the community of
experts in the field. Scientific knowledge tells us that a comet is a
body in orbit around the sun and that a comet is not the gods’ portent
of events to come. But the scientific theory is not logically ironclad.
It depends upon a leap of intuition and conviction from evidence to
explanation.</p>
<p>In making his argument, however, Polanyi knew full well that “belief”
is a treacherous word when applied to scientific knowledge. There are
all kinds of beliefs that scientists and other people regard as
unscientific, false, or immoral. So how can we distinguish valid
scientific belief from other forms of belief? And why is this important?
In Personal Knowledge Polanyi aimed to establish a new epistemology,
free of subjectivism or relativism, in which scientific knowledge is
understood to be personal and free, rather than mechanical and
deterministic. This knowledge is not solitary, however, because it is
crucially based in a social community of “mutual trust and confidence”
and rationally and morally capable of serving modern society “as its
guide” (375, with italics in original text).</p>
<p>The first-time reader, as well as some previous readers, may find it
helpful to have some guidance in taking up Personal Knowledge. The
organization of the book is not straightforward. It is not “one long
argument,” as Charles Darwin said of his great work The Origin of
Species.2 Polanyi was a consummate essayist, and Personal Knowledge
builds upon essays that he had been writing and publishing for some
twenty years, while also incorporating entirely new materials and
ideas.3 There is overlap among sections and chapters of the book. Some
sections stand well alone. Further, because Personal Knowledge is so
closely rooted in Polanyi’s own experiences and preoccupations, rather
than in formal philosophy, some passages read more like political or
moral philosophy than philosophy of knowledge. It is a very personal
book that exemplifies Polanyi’s theme of the personal nature of
knowledge.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this introduction, I look briefly at the author’s
career as a distinguished scientist and identify the preoccupations that
compelled him to write a book on scientific life.4 After that, I turn to
some details of the organization of the book, its central concepts, and
keywords. In conclusion, by way of helping to highlight passages in the
book, I look at ideas that moored Personal Knowledge to the 1950s, as
well as those that make it a book of contemporary interest.</p>
<p>PERSONAL CONTEXT AND PREOCCUPATIONS OF MICHAEL POLANYI’S
PHILOSOPHY</p>
<p>Born in Budapest in 1891, Polanyi’s family upbringing was secular,
literary, and scientific, as was characteristic of many intellectuals
from an assimilated bourgeois Jewish background in central Europe. He
finished two degrees at the University of Budapest: a medical degree in
1913 and a PhD in physical chemistry in 1917. Formative events of his
youth were the First World War, in which he served as a medical officer,
and political developments in Hungary from 1913 to 1919 in which he
sometimes parted company with his more left-wing brothers Karl and Adolf
and his eldest sister Laura. He served in the Ministry of Health in 1919
in a short-lived Hungarian republican government, resigning his post
when a communist regime came into power. This regime was overthrown, in
turn, four months later by conservative nationalist military and
political alliances. After this period of political upheaval, Polanyi
left Hungary to pursue a career in Germany, where he became director of
the chemical kinetics research group in Fritz Haber’s Institute for
Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society in
Berlin. While in Berlin, Polanyi established himself as a world expert
in his field, heading a research group that pursued investigations on
gas adsorption, catalysis, x-ray crystallography, solid-state chemistry,
and reaction rates and mechanisms in the chemistry of simple gases. He
is regarded as one of the founders of modern chemical kinetics based in
thermodynamics and quantum theory.5</p>
<p>By the late 1920s Polanyi was paying close attention to crises in
European economic and political conditions. At this time his brother
Karl was a senior editorialist on economic and international affairs for
the Austrian Economist, a periodical modeled on Great Britain’s
Economist.6 In 1928 Michael Polanyi attended an economics seminar led by
the Russian émigré Jacob Marschak and, two years later, Polanyi
organized his own informal economics seminar whose members included
Gustav Stolper, the editor of the prominent German Economist journal.
After Adolf Hitler’s appointment as German Chancellor in late January
1933 and implementation of anti-Semitic laws in April 1933, Polanyi
moved to Manchester where he headed the university’s physical chemistry
laboratory. He was unable to duplicate the intellectual excitement of
the science of his Berlin years, however, and, by the late 1930s and the
war years, Polanyi was increasingly distracted from his chemical
research. In 1948 he exchanged his position in chemistry for a chair in
social studies that was specifically created for him at the
university.</p>
<p>Polanyi’s arrival in Manchester coincided with the coming to
political power in Britain of a coalition government that proposed
measures for centralized planning in order to combat problems of the
Depression. Some scientists were calling for greater attention by
scientists to the needs of British technology and social planning.
Polanyi began to fear the development in Great Britain of the kind of
strongly centralized, command economy that had come to dominate Nazi
Germany and the Soviet Union.7 After visits to the Soviet Union, where
he talked with scientists about the implications of Five-Year Plans for
scientific research and the Soviet economy, Polanyi put together films
on the free market. In 1945 he published a book on employment and free
trade in which he offered a positive brief for the efficacy of private
enterprise as a system of spontaneous and mutually adjusting individual
actions. Agreeing in part with the economic theories of John Maynard
Keynes, Polanyi allowed for some government intervention, such as
control of the money supply, to address recession and unemployment, but
he rejected other aspects of Keynes’s economic policies such as
government-funded programs of public works.8</p>
<p>The late 1930s and early 1940s was a period when Polanyi and his
family were trying to help many friends and relatives escape from
incarceration and execution in Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the Soviet
Union. On a 1935 visit to the Soviet Union, Polanyi saw his niece Eva
Striker, whose Viennese husband had accepted a research position in
physics at the Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology. Shortly
after Polanyi’s visit, Eva was arrested on charges that she was part of
a group aiming to kill Joseph Stalin. She spent a harrowing
eighteen-month period in prison before she was freed and expelled from
Russia. Arthur Koestler, who was a family friend, later said that Eva’s
story was the inspiration for Darkness at Noon, his novel of Soviet
terror and Stalinist purges.9</p>
<p>Polanyi’s loathing for centralized and repressive regimes, as he
witnessed them in Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Russia, strongly
influenced his economic and political writing, but he located his turn
to philosophy of science in the specific case of Nikolai Vavilov, a
Russian geneticist who became the target of Stalinist attacks in the
mid-1930s on the ideological grounds that his plant research ignored
Marxian principles. Western scientists learned in 1940 that Vavilov had
been arrested, and they later discovered that he received a death
sentence for espionage and died of malnutrition in 1943.</p>
<p>Vavilov’s fate was largely engineered by Trofim Lysenko, as he gained
political power for his methods of agricultural plant breeding. Lysenko
argued that accustoming plants to new environmental conditions would
quickly alter the plants and their descendants, so that
winter-intolerant stocks could thrive in harsh Russian temperatures.
This theory was said to be consistent with Marxist ideology. In the
West, it was reported that Vavilov had failed to convince his trial
judges that the Lysenkoist theory was bogus in contrast to the
scientifically accepted Mendelian theory of inheritance as a matter of
the transmission of stable material particles (genes). Polanyi suddenly
realized, he later said, that Vavilov did not have a philosophy of
science that satisfactorily explains what distinguishes true science
from imposters and opponents. This is the demarcation problem. So
Polanyi began posing questions about Western philosophy of science: “How
was its general acceptance among us to be accounted for? Was this
acceptance justified? On what grounds?”10 His conclusions surprised many
philosophers of science.</p>
<p>ORGANIZATION, CENTRAL CONCEPTS, AND KEYWORDS IN PERSONAL
KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p>In Polanyi’s two-page preface to Personal Knowledge he states that
his endeavor “is primarily an enquiry into the nature and justification
of scientific knowledge” and an attempt to refute the usual view that
scientific knowledge is detached and impersonal in character (vii). The
book is divided into four sections. Part 1, titled “The Art of Knowing,”
has four chapters: “Objectivity,” “Probability,” “Order,” and “Skills.”
Polanyi begins by discussing some great scientific achievements such as
the Copernican revolution and Einstein’s theory of special relativity.
He argues the insufficiency of formal philosophies of science—commonly
and loosely identified with positivism—to completely account for the
discovery or justification of a new theory or conceptual framework.
Scientific knowledge is probable knowledge, Polanyi argues, and it
tolerates or incorporates the existence of anomalous information and
random occurrences while settling on general laws and patterns of order.
The scientist has learned how to do this through what Polanyi calls the
“tacit component” of accomplishing scientific work.</p>
<p>Introducing this novel conception in chapter 4 of part 1, Polanyi
describes the informal and tacit elements essential to science. These
include transmission of skills from master to apprentice, the
development of “connoisseurship,” and the inculcation in a student of a
disciplinary tradition and interpretive framework. These tacit
components of knowing account for the process of problem solving or
discovery: the art of understanding the whole by intuitively combining
an internalized subsidiary awareness of particular things with a focus
on a question to be solved about external objects. Common experiences
that give us a sense of this tacit knowledge, which cannot be
articulated by rote rules, are the achievements of riding a bicycle or
playing the piano or discriminating a fine wine (49–50, 54).</p>
<p>Part 2, titled “The Tacit Component,” consists of individual chapters
on “Articulation,” “Intellectual Passions,” and “Conviviality.” Polanyi
especially labored over chapter 5, “Articulation,” and he took almost a
year to write it.11 This chapter, along with the one on intellectual
passions, was singled out for its brilliance in Thomas Kuhn’s
blockbuster book of 1962, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. A
focus of both these chapters (chapters 5 and 6) is language and the
relationship between thought and speech. Polanyi writes that there
exists unspecifiable and unarticulated knowledge among scientists that
is not susceptible to language and usually is dismissed in philosophy of
science. In this context, Polanyi explicitly rejects the young Ludwig
Wittgenstein’s dictum “Of what cannot be said thereof one must be
silent” (87, 87n2). Drawing here as elsewhere upon his own scientific
career and briefly on historical examples, Polanyi describes how
conceptual meanings in different language frameworks result in mutual
incomprehension between holders of the different frameworks. Discovery
and justification of novel phenomena and ideas require breaking out of a
language system and overcoming a logical gap. It is a heuristic process,
he writes. It is an experience of “conversion” that subsequently
produces disciples who “live in a different world” from what they and
other scientists believed beforehand (151).</p>
<p>Polanyi begins to develop in chapter 6 the theme of conviviality that
is the center of chapter 7. The term “Conviviality” is a little
puzzling, until one understands that Polanyi is discussing the kinds of
social arrangements that further the pursuit of scientific truth in
contrast to those which undermine and destroy it. On the one side are
free societies and on the other are totalitarian societies. The pursuit
of science thrives in free societies in which disciplinary communities
of scientists control a system of learning and apprenticeship, advancing
and disseminating scientific knowledge by consensus of scientific
opinion that is exercised within a set of scientific institutions and
scientific standards that are mutually decided by scientists themselves
(216–19).</p>
<p>In contrast to this ideal of scientific life is the distortion of
true science by the political values and social ends of a totalitarian
state. Earlier in Personal Knowledge Polanyi identifies the concept of
strictly objective and material knowledge with what he calls the
Laplacian “paradigm,” citing the statement in Laplace’s 1814 Treatise on
Probability that a powerful enough intelligence could use the laws of
physics to calculate movements of all bodies from knowledge of natural
forces and original positions of matter. Using such a mechanical program
as a template for human affairs, one that reduces all actions to basic
laws of matter and force, Polanyi argues, resulted in Hitler’s and
Stalin’s authoritarian regimes of social calculation. These left “no
justification to public liberties” and demanded that natural and social
scientists serve the ends of the state in order to define and control
all human activities, thereby discrediting science itself (139–42,
232–34). Polanyi concludes part 3 by asserting the need to reinvigorate
confidence in scientific values and universal knowledge within a liberal
and free society.</p>
<p>In part 3, titled “The Justification of Personal Knowledge,” Polanyi
sets out to demonstrate in greater detail the operation of personal
knowledge as an act of commitment within the process of scientific
knowing. Scientists and philosophers of science, including Laplace for
example, often express confidence in facts or theories in terms of their
degree of probability. Yet, argues Polanyi in chapter 8 on “The Logic of
Affirmation,” what is happening in an affirmative statement based in
probability is a statement that is made in a “fiduciary mode.” The
scientist asserts “I believe” this to be the case, not that this is the
case, with confidence that the theory very likely is true, although it
may be false (255–56). It is impossible, Polanyi argues, to make a
statement of absolute certainty, and, in chapter 9, titled “The Critique
of Doubt,” he advises that we must abandon a critical philosophy that
prohibits statements of belief and favors statements of doubt, because
doubt is no better guide to truth than is belief.</p>
<p>In “The Critique of Doubt,” Polanyi writes of both the difficulty of
doubting and the tendency to doubt. We can be subject to doubt in many
different kinds of situations: a court of law, a house of worship, or an
African Azande witchcraft ceremony. In contrast, we may not experience
doubt at all because of the difficulty of breaking out of a coherent
system of beliefs to which we are accustomed. Yet if we operate within a
set of beliefs or dogmas, how, then, can a scientist step out of an
established disciplinary framework into a different way of thinking? How
do we justify a step in science that relies on logic that is inferential
and probable and therefore dubious even if reasonable? For Polanyi, the
answer lies in the leap of commitment, as he argues in chapter 10
(titled “Commitment”). The act of commitment is personal, but it is not
simply subjective, he argues (300). Commitment is acknowledgment of the
“person of the scientist as the agent responsible for conducting and
accrediting scientific discoveries” that have objective validity (311).
This position is not solipsistic, he argues, because it is based on
belief in an external reality, and it assumes “the existence of other
persons who can likewise approach the same reality” (316).</p>
<p>Part 4, titled “Knowing and Being,” might appear a change in focus
from theories of scientific knowledge to theories of evolutionary
biology, but Polanyi’s larger project is to locate scientific knowing
within a broader heritage of knowing that has evolved over the course of
cosmic history. Chapter 11, “The Logic of Achievement,” uses examples
ranging from embryological development to animal learning, in order to
argue that consciousness and intelligence cannot be reduced to the kinds
of material processes explained by chemistry and physics. This theme is
further developed in chapter 12, “Knowing Life,” where Polanyi’s
discussion of morphological notions, such as Hans Driesch’s regulative
principle and Hans Spemann’s principle of embryonic organizers, is
followed by analysis of Gestalt psychologist Wolfgang Köhler’s studies
of learning and creativity in apes. For Polanyi, these kinds of studies
demonstrate the evolution of the human capacity for understanding the
real world (374).</p>
<p>In the final chapter 13, “The Rise of Man,” Polanyi introduces the
notion of “emergence” in order to link themes of the entire book.
Distancing himself from Neo-Darwinian theory, Polanyi insists that there
is in biological evolution an ordering action that operates within the
random fluctuations and environmental conditions of life (384). He
argues that these operations are unspecifiable in terms of preceding
levels of life and that consciousness and intelligence are results of
emergence from lower to higher levels. No new creative agent is required
in the process. It is a phenomenon, Polanyi suggests, which Teilhard de
Chardin called “noogenesis,” or genesis of the sphere of mind, in his
book Le phénomène humain. We have an intuition of this process, Polanyi
suggests, because of our own experience of the emergent heuristics of
sudden insight or scientific discovery (395). Having earlier in Personal
Knowledge likened the process of scientific discovery to religious
conversion, Polanyi returns in the very last sentence of his book to the
theme of belief and faith, harking back to his earlier references to
St. Augustine’s struggles to acquire religious faith (266–67, for
example). Polanyi concludes: the human belief that truth is the result
of contact with reality is “how a Christian is placed when worshipping
God” (405).</p>
<p>In reading Personal Knowledge there are keywords that the reader may
find helpful. Some of these keywords were prominent in most philosophy
of science in the mid-twentieth century. Others are words that were
unusual in philosophy of science, but culturally important.12 Thus, on
the philosophical side, we have: discovery, empiricism, evolution,
framework, heuristic, indeterminism, justification, language, logic,
mechanism, objectivity, positivism, reality, subjectivity, theory, and
truth. On the political side: authority, communism, community, freedom,
free society, liberalism, materialism, Marxism, tradition,
totalitarianism. “Authority,” “community,” “consensus,” and
“tradition”—words that Polanyi identifies as essential to the stability
of scientific knowledge—were terms common in mid-twentieth-century
sociology or political science, but not in philosophy of science.
Although a few philosophers of science, notably Karl Popper, explicitly
framed their philosophical work in the context of political concerns
such as freedom and totalitarianism, most did not, unlike Popper and
Polanyi.</p>
<p>“Belief,” which is a keyword in Polanyi’s philosophy of science,
carried the common connotation in the 1950s of ideology, religion, or
opinion. “Belief” triggered skepticism or outrage in formal philosophy
unless explained rationally, for example by degree of probability.
“Conversion” was an even more objectionable word to philosophers of
science, since it was tinged with psychological or religious meaning.
Here Polanyi obviously is doing something radical. “Tacit knowledge” and
“personal knowledge” are perhaps the two most important keywords that
Polanyi coins, and he ties their meanings to other keywords that he
marshals in order to explain how science works: articulate and
inarticulate knowledge, commitment, connoisseurship, conviviality,
fiduciary mode, framework, indwelling, logical gap, passion, skill,
subsidiary and focal knowledge, unspecifiability, wholes, and
particulars. Other keywords to pay attention to are the morally and
politically infused terms “moral inversion” and “public liberty” which
clearly place Polanyi’s philosophy in ethical and political contexts.13
The keyword “emergence,” which appears only in the last chapter of the
book, is a word that Polanyi borrows from earlier usages in order to
link together his antireductionist accounts of scientific knowledge and
human life.</p>
<p>PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE IN ITS PAST AND THE PRESENT</p>
<p>As he mentions in chapter 13, Polanyi borrowed the notion of
emergence from other authors, including his Manchester colleague Samuel
Alexander (382). As a monographic volume, Personal Knowledge had its
immediate origin in revisions of Polanyi’s 1951–52 Gifford Lectures at
the University of Aberdeen, and Alexander had discussed the idea of
emergence in his own Gifford Lectures of 1916–18.14 The mandate of the
Gifford Lectures is discussion of natural religion or natural theology
as knowledge “without reference to or reliance upon any supposed special
exceptional or so-called miraculous revelation.”15 Given this immediate
context for Polanyi’s book, it is hardly surprising that it has had a
following among theologians and religious scholars. There is much in the
book that draws thought-provoking and contentious analogies between
scientific belief and religious faith. Two sections of the book,
“Dwelling In and Breaking Out” and “Religious Doubt,” often are cited by
religious scholars.16</p>
<p>Members of the intelligent design community argue that biological
complexity is evidence of God’s intelligence rather than of natural
selection, and some have claimed that Polanyi’s views on evolution
support their position. Most Polanyi scholars note, in contrast, that
his discussion of emergence does not include the kind of agency required
by the intelligent design thesis. Polanyi explicitly wrote that the
evolutionary process is neither predetermined from the start nor the
result of an external creative agency (395). Biologists and philosophers
of biology have largely found Polanyi’s discussion of evolutionary
biology unsupported and unsound. Marjorie Grene, who later became a
distinguished philosopher of biology, provided research and editorial
assistance to Polanyi in the 1950s while he was writing the book. Her
discontent with chapter 13 increased in later years as she became
convinced that Polanyi had failed to understand Darwinian theory. While
Grene praised much of the first three parts of Personal Knowledge,
especially Polanyi’s working out of the elements of tacit knowledge and
what she saw as his undermining of Cartesian body-mind dualism, she
found his anthropocentric cosmic and emergent evolutionism
unconvincing.17</p>
<p>Polanyi’s antimechanistic views, however, and his emphasis on
hierarchy and development in biology were in keeping with some work in
contemporary biology, for example, views discussed in Max Delbrück’s
biophysics group in Berlin and in the Theoretical Biology Club which met
in Cambridge and Oxford in the 1930s.18 The idea that biological
properties and the structure of organisms arise from lower-level
entities, but are novel and irreducible to the particulars from which
the whole has emerged, became an increasingly significant theme in
biology and in philosophy of biology by the late twentieth century.
Arguments of emergence and complexity became important, too, in
organizational management and systems theory, in which Polanyi’s work
found new applications by the 1990s.</p>
<p>Polanyi’s political concerns in Personal Knowledge found resonance in
a large audience of readers, as has continued to be true in later years.
At the time of the first printing of the book in 1958, the Cold War was
in full swing. Stalin had died in 1953 and a program of de-Stalinist
reforms had begun under Nikita Khrushchev.19 Some reforms took place in
Soviet-controlled Poland in 1956, but the Hungarian uprising that year
against its communist regime was forcefully suppressed by Soviet troops.
The Berlin wall would be constructed in 1961 just at the time that
Polanyi’s book was still finding its readers, and it was only in 1965
that the Soviet prohibition against modern genetic research was lifted
and Lysenko lost his official scientific position.</p>
<p>Personal Knowledge offered a message in political thought not
dissimilar from Hannah Arendt’s writings in the 1950s and 1960s. Polanyi
quotes, from the British edition of The Origins of Totalitarianism,
Arendt’s memorable statement that Soviet ideology insists on abolishing
its citizens’ capacity to distinguish between truth and fiction while
terrorizing them in submission to the state (242, 242n2). Much like
Arendt, Polanyi insisted that there are universal truths, and he argued
for the necessity of a balance between individual freedom and public
liberty in a liberal democracy.</p>
<p>Polanyi’s ideas also resonated with readers of the economist
Friedrich von Hayek. Much like Hayek, although differing from him in
some important details, Polanyi was arguing in Personal Knowledge that
the most propitious forms of organization in political, economic, and
scientific life are analogous: individual and freely-acting initiatives
must be allowed to prosper and to interact and mutually adjust
themselves without calculation or premeditation in order to produce
systems that result in order, novelty, and progress.20 This kind of
dynamic mirrors the processes of cosmic evolution, in Polanyi’s view,
and his argument continues to resonate in discussions of economic,
political, and systems theory.</p>
<p>Polanyi’s epistemology of science—notably his emphasis on tacit
knowledge and on commitment of belief—was based in his experiences as a
theoretical and laboratory scientist, as well as in his political and
economic concerns. There have been few twentieth-century philosophers of
science with his career scientific credentials, although many
philosophers of science have had a mathematical or scientific education.
As an accomplished scientist, Polanyi had special status in philosophy,
but his status was also that of the outsider. In Anglo-American
philosophy of science of the 1950s, logical empiricism and formal
analytic philosophy were in the mainstream, and philosophers focused
within these traditions on problems such as methods of probabilistic
verification and implications of the holistic Duhem-Quine thesis that
any theory can be saved as a whole by background adjustments and
auxiliary hypotheses. Philosophers asked what justifies belief in a
theory, and Polanyi’s answer was quite different from the usual
ones.21</p>
<p>Another philosophical problem much in vogue in the 1950s was the
demarcation question, at a time when there were highly visible
discussions in the public media of science and pseudoscience. The
pseudoscience question was debated not only for Lysenkoist biology,
still in effect in the Soviet Union, but for parapsychology, eugenics,
racial biology, and Freudianism. Immanuel Velikovsky’s Worlds in
Collision, which broke with all accepted scientific theories of the
early history of the solar system, created a furor about pseudoscience
after it was published in 1950.22 Polanyi entered these debates with his
own</p>
<p>answers to the demarcation question and the underdetermination
problem.</p>
<p>Regarding Lysenkoism and demarcation, we have seen the outline of
Polanyi’s answer. He argued that science is social in its very essence
in the ways in which skills, standards, and tacit understandings are
transmitted from person to person in an institutional system in which
members act freely but work within mutual consensus. What counts as real
science has to be learned within this system. As a consequence, Lysenko
was in no respect a scientist, nor was Lysenkoism a science. This social
approach to demarcation looked suspicious to philosophers, however,
because it roots scientific knowledge in social and historical
circumstances, as well as in empiricism and logic. This seemed a
dangerous path and, in any case, an unphilosophical one.23 Polanyi
himself did not intend to suggest the contingency of scientific truth,
and he insisted upon the stability of interpretive frameworks in science
and scientists’ ability to establish contact with reality. His
statements of his personal belief and commitment to this ontology failed
to assuage many philosophers’ misgivings, however.</p>
<p>Other challenges to mainstream philosophy of science helped establish
the context in which Personal Knowledge was discussed and evaluated in
the late 1950s and afterwards. The Viennese-born Karl Popper rejected
the legitimacy of empirical verification as the right way to establish
scientific hypothesis and theory. Instead, despite the Duhem-Quine
thesis and other objections, Popper insisted on the criterion of
falsifiability, or the necessity for a hypothesis to withstand tests
that could decisively disprove it, as a basis for theory choice.
Further, Popper argued that falsifiability is the best criterion for
demarcating true science from pseudoscience.24 In a different vein, but
like Polanyi, Stephen Toulmin judged formal logic to be a misleading and
inadequate representation of how humans acquire knowledge, and he
proposed a gradualist Darwinian model for conceptual advance in the
sciences.25</p>
<p>Thomas Kuhn, like Polanyi, judged Popper to be naive in his normative
attitude that scientists should be eternally skeptical about their
theories and that they should respond immediately to evidence of any
anomaly that appears to falsify a theory. In contrast, Kuhn developed an
explanation of scientific change as a process of stages that proceed
through acceptance of a dominant stable framework or “paradigm,” the
practice of normal science, the accumulation of anomalies that generate
a crisis, and the accomplishment of a revolution as scientists convert
to the new framework and try to convert others in turn. Like Polanyi,
Kuhn described science as a social community, and he highlighted the
productive tension in science between tradition and innovation or
between stability and change. Like Toulmin, he suggested that an
evolutionary epistemology might solve some problems in philosophy of
science, although Kuhn emphasized revolution rather than evolution in
Structure.26 These four men occasionally saw each other during the
1950s, and they expressed criticism of each others’ views to varying
degrees, with Popper especially vehement against Polanyi’s and Kuhn’s
lines of argument.27 Among the four, Polanyi was the only one who took a
realist position on the ontology of scientific explanation, comparing
his conviction, as we have seen, to the worship of God.</p>
<p>Although it was far from his intention, Polanyi’s ideas
revolutionized the sociology of science and played an important role in
the conceptual foundations of the new field of science studies. This
area of teaching and research developed in the 1970s out of programs
meant to reform science education and to integrate liberal values and
human and social dimensions into studies of the history and methodology
of scientific knowledge. David Edge, the co-founder of the journal
Science Studies (later renamed Social Studies of Science) wrote that the
new field drew initial inspiration from the work of Kuhn and from Bernal
and Polanyi. Taking a leaf from Polanyi’s (and Kuhn’s) reflections on
the stability of systems of belief, the new sociologists of scientific
knowledge suggested that all systems of belief should be assumed equally
legitimate until proven otherwise and that the aim of sociological
analysis is to discover how scientists convince one another and their
audiences of the superiority of a particular scientific explanation over
other forms of explanation. The science studies methodology emphasizes
the social and psychological conditions of the construction of
scientific knowledge rather the empirical and logical structure of the
discovery of scientific knowledge. Constructivists have made use of
Polanyi’s notions of tacit and personal knowledge, as well as his
emphasis on passion, commitment, trust, and belief, but their work has
often been critical of scientific elites and nearly always denied a
realist foundation to scientific achievement. These are results with
which Polanyi would have deeply disagreed, of course.28</p>
<p>The initial impact of Personal Knowledge was very much conditioned by
the furor over Kuhn’s book that brought added attention to Polanyi’s
exposition of tacit knowledge and its roots in the social structure of
science.29 Kuhn was not especially interested in the demarcation
problem, nor did he worry at the time about the public status of
scientific knowledge, as Polanyi did. Polanyi thought that he had
successfully provided a philosophy that not only demarcated science from
nonscience but also demonstrated how the scientific community provides a
model for the political order by balancing individual liberty and
collective authority, while not relinquishing the quest for
transcendental truth.</p>
<p>Personal Knowledge is a book that clearly displays its historical
moorings in political, philosophical, and moral issues that Polanyi
confronted over the course of his long professional and personal career.
Polanyi’s audience has numbered readers far wider than philosophers of
science, whom he meant to reach, or sociologists of science, who became
an unintended audience.30 The book has remained a classic that is read
because of the multiple ways in which it addresses questions at the
heart of how we learn, how we know, and how we live. Personal Knowledge
reflects an identity of Polanyi as provocateur and polemicist. It
challenges the reader to debate the tension between the rationalist
ideal of value-free knowledge and the humanist ideal of ethically
responsible knowledge. It is not an easy book to read. Keep the keywords
in mind.</p>

<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>THIS is primarily an enquiry into the nature and justification of
scientific knowledge. But my reconsideration of scientific knowledge
leads on to a wide range of questions outside science.</p>
<p>I start by rejecting the ideal of scientific detachment. In the exact
sciences, this false ideal is perhaps harmless, for it is in fact
disregarded there by scientists. But we shall see that it exercises a
destructive influence in biology, psychology and sociology, and
falsifies our whole outlook far beyond the domain of science. I want to
establish an alternative ideal of knowledge, quite generally.</p>
<p>Hence the wide scope of this book and hence also the coining of the
new term I have used for my title: Personal Knowledge. The two words may
seem to contradict each other: for true knowledge is deemed impersonal,
universally established, objective. But the seeming contradiction is
resolved by modifying the conception of knowing.</p>
<p>I have used the findings of Gestalt psychology as my first clues to
this conceptual reform. Scientists have run away from the philosophic
implications of gestalt; I want to countenance them uncompromisingly. I
regard knowing as an active comprehension of the things known, an action
that requires skill. Skilful knowing and doing is performed by
subordinating a set of particulars, as clues or tools, to the shaping of
a skilful achievement, whether practical or theoretical. We may then be
said to become ‘subsidiarily aware’ of these particulars within our
‘focal awareness’ of the coherent entity that we achieve. Clues and
tools are things used as such and not observed in themselves. They are
made to function as extensions of our bodily equipment and this involves
a certain change of our own being. Acts of comprehension are to this
extent irreversible, and also non-critical. For we cannot possess any
fixed framework within which the re-shaping of our hitherto fixed
framework could be critically tested.</p>
<p>Such is the personal participation of the knower in all acts of
understanding. But this does not make our understanding subjective.
Comprehension is neither an arbitrary act nor a passive experience, but
a responsible act claiming universal validity. Such knowing is indeed
objective in the sense of establishing contact with a hidden reality; a
contact that is defined as the condition for anticipating an
indeterminate range of yet unknown (and perhaps yet inconceivable) true
implications. It seems reasonable to describe this fusion of the
personal and the objective as Personal Knowledge.</p>
<p>Personal knowledge is an intellectual commitment, and as such
inherently hazardous. Only affirmations that could be false can be said
to convey objective knowledge of this kind. All affirmations published
in this book are my own personal commitments; they claim this, and no
more than this, for themselves.</p>
<p>Throughout this book I have tried to make this situation apparent. I
have shown that into every act of knowing there enters a passionate
contribution of the person knowing what is being known, and that this
coefficient is no mere imperfection but a vital component of his
knowledge. And around this central fact I have tried to construct a
system of correlative beliefs which I can sincerely hold, and to which I
can see no acceptable alternatives. But ultimately, it is my own
allegiance that upholds these convictions, and it is on such warrant
alone that they can lay claim to the reader’s attention.</p>

<p>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p>
<p>THIS book is based on my Gifford Lectures 1951–2, delivered in the
University of Aberdeen. I wish to thank the University for this
opportunity to develop my thoughts. Since subsequent work has not
essentially changed my views, large parts of the lectures could be
retained unchanged; other parts have been reconsidered, some cut out and
others amplified.</p>
<p>Manchester University has made it possible for me to accept the
invitation of Aberdeen and to spend nine years almost exclusively on the
preparation of this book. The generosity of Senate and Council in
allowing me to exchange my Chair of Physical Chemistry for a
Professorial appointment without lecturing duties, has placed me deeply
in their debt. I want to thank particularly Sir John S. B. Stopford,
then Vice-Chancellor, and Lord Simon of Wythenshawe, then Chairman of
the Council.</p>
<p>Many of my colleagues at the University have helped me in my
enquiries; I have never ceased to admire their patience. May I thank
them here once more. I recall also with gratitude the weeks spent on two
occasions with the Committee on Social Thought in Chicago, where I
lectured on these subjects.</p>
<p>This work owes much to Dr. Marjorie Grene. The moment we first talked
about it in Chicago in 1950 she seemed to have guessed my whole purpose,
and ever since she has never ceased to help its pursuit. Setting aside
her own work as a philosopher, she has devoted herself for years to the
service of the present enquiry. Our discussions have catalysed its
progress at every stage and there is hardly a page that has not
benefited from her criticism. She has a share in anything that I may
have achieved here. Dr. J. H. Oldham, Mr. Irving Kristol, Miss Elizabeth
Sewell and Professor Edward Shils have read the whole manuscript; Mr. W.
Haas, Dr. W. Mays, Professor M. S. Bartlett and Dr. C. Lejewski have
read parts of it. They have all suggested improvements, for which I
thank them. Miss Olive Davies has carried the burden of secretarial work
connected with this book for ten years. Her skill and hard work have
given me invaluable assistance. Expenses of books, travel and assistance
in the service of this enquiry were covered by grants received from the
Rockefeller Foundation, the Volker Fund and the Congress for Cultural
Freedom.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to express my admiration for a person who
unhesitatingly shared with me the risks of this unusual enterprise and
sustained year after year the stresses radiating from me as the centre
of this unaccustomed activity; I mean my wife.</p>
