<h4 id="the-logic-of-emergence">4. THE LOGIC OF EMERGENCE</h4>
<p>We can now return to our proper subject matter, which is the
contemplation of anthropogenesis. We have reached the point at which we
must confront the unspecifiability of higher levels in terms of
particulars belonging to lower levels, with the fact that the higher
levels have in fact come into existence spontaneously from elements of
these lower levels. How can the emergent have arisen from particulars
that cannot constitute it? Does some new creative agent enter the
emergent system at every new stage? If so, how can we account for the
continuity of the process of anthropogenesis?</p>
<p>To answer these questions we must add some further questions to them.
The rise of man culminates in the unfolding of the noosphere. Is this
firmament of superior knowledge a last-minute improvisation of the
anthropogenic process? Or were all the works of the human mind already
inscribed invisibly in the configuration of primeval incandescent gases?
Or must, alternatively, each new discovery of man be ascribed to a new
divine intervention?</p>
<p>The first thing to observe here is that, strictly speaking, it is not
the emerged higher form of being, but our knowledge of it, that is
unspecifiable in terms of its lower level particulars. We cannot speak
of emergence, therefore, except in conjunction with a corresponding
progression from a lower to a higher conceptual level. And we realize
then that conceptual progression may not always be existential, but that
it becomes so by degrees.</p>
<p>For example: pour a handful of shot into a flat-bottomed saucepan,
and you will find the grains forming a regular pattern. Crystals owe
their symmetrical shapes to a similar principle: molecules of identical
sizes and shapes tend to form regular aggregates in the same way as
grains of shot in a saucepan. Is this the emergence of a new
comprehensive feature? It is arguable that we could know the complete
topography of the atoms in a crystal, without seeing that they form a
regular pattern. There is, indeed, always a noticeable logical gap
between a topography and a pattern derived from it, and to this extent
no pattern is specifiable in terms of its topography. Yet since in the
case of a crystal we can easily pass from the pattern to the topography
and back again, the conception of such a pattern is in fact not
destroyed by a knowledge of its topographic particulars. I would
acknowledge, therefore, in this case two distinguishable conceptual
levels but not two separate levels of existence.</p>
<p>We can even widen the conceptual gap between two levels, to the point
where it precludes altogether the representation of the higher level in
terms of the lower, without establishing a complete existential
disjunction between the two. Consider the chemical aspects of matter.
They are fully determined by atomic physics; yet no Laplacean Mind
schooled in quantum mechanics could replace the science of chemistry.
For chemistry answers questions regarding the interaction of more or
less stable chemical substances, and these questions cannot be raised
without experience of these substances and of the practical conditions
in which they are to be handled. A Laplacean knowledge which merely
predicts what will happen under any given conditions cannot tell us what
conditions should be given; these conditions are determined by the
technical skill and peculiar interests of chemists and hence cannot be
worked out on paper. Therefore, while quantum mechanics can explain in
principle all chemical reactions, it cannot replace, even in principle,
our knowledge of chemistry. We may acknowledge this as an incipient
separation of two forms of existence.</p>
<p>We have seen that two sharply separated levels of existence emerge by
randomization. But even in this case, the emergent reality is
comparatively poor in new features. No richly endowed new reality can be
seen emerging in the inanimate domain. This happens for the first time
in the emergence of a living being from inanimate constituents. I have
described this process as a chance fluctuation which releases the action
of certain selfsustaining operational principles. This results in the
formation of two levels of existence: an upper level governed by
physiology, and a subsidiary, lower level defined by physics and
chemistry—the operations on the upper level being predicated on the
emergence of an individual, whose interests they serve. In the course of
anthropogenesis, individuality develops from beginnings of a purely
vegetative character to successive stages of active, perceptive, and
eventually responsible, personhood. This phylogenetic emergence is
continuous—just as ontogenetic emergence clearly is. Hence the higher
principles governing the emergent forms of evolution presumably gain
control gradually of the evolving beings, in the same way as they
gradually become more pronounced and predominant in the course of man’s
embryonic and infantile development. We shall say, in particular, that
the rise of man includes a continuous intensification of individuality,
similar to that which normally takes place in the formation of a human
person from the parental zygote. No new creative agent, therefore, need
be said to enter an emergent system at consecutive new stages of being.
Novel forms of existence take control of the system by a process of
maturation.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this conception still leaves open an unresolved conflict
between continuity and essential progress. It presents us with an
unwelcome alternative: either to regard the process of maturation itself
as predetermined from the start, or else to assume that it results from
the continuous intensification of an external creative agency. We shall
have to reconsider the concept of maturation in order to reconcile these
alternatives. The argument will fall into two parts, the first dealing
with determinism a fronte by the universal target of a commitment, the
other with determinism a tergo by the bodily mechanism of the person
entering on a commitment.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I shall recall for a start the ontogenetic emergence of human
intelligence, as described by Piaget. The infant’s understanding of its
surroundings is self-centred. It goes on plunging irreversibly from one
form of comprehension to another. Then, gradually, it develops a solid
interpretative framework, each successive stage of which offers a
possibility for increasingly elaborate logical operations. Irreversible
comprehension is replaced by the steady deployment of discursive
thought. The appetitive, motoric, perceptive child is transformed into
an intelligent person, reasoning with universal intent. We have here a
process of maturation closely analogous to the corresponding step of
anthropogenetic emergence, leading from the self-centred individuality
of the animal to the responsible personhood of thoughtful man: in fact,
to the emergence of the noosphere.</li>
</ol>
<p>This kind of emergence is known to us from inside. We experience
intellectual growth in the process of education and, in more dramatic
forms, in the creative acts of the mind. I may recall in particular the
process of scientific discovery. This process is not specifiable in
terms of strict rules, for it involves a modification of the existing
interpretative framework. It crosses a heuristic gap and causes thereby
a self-modification of the intelligence achieving discovery. In the
absence of any formal procedure on which the discoverer could rely, he
is guided by his intimations of a hidden knowledge. He senses the
proximity of something unknown and strives passionately towards it.
Where great originality is at work in science or, even more clearly, in
artistic creation, the innovating mind sets itself new standards more
satisfying to itself, and modifies itself by the process of innovation
so as to become more satisfying to itself in the light of these self-set
standards. Yet all the time the creative mind is searching for something
believed to be real; which, being real, will—when discovered—be entitled
to claim universal validity—something the knowledge of which must indeed
passionately insist on its own universal validity. Such are the acts by
which man improves his own mind; such the steps by which our noosphere
was brought into existence. For in the ontogenesis of the innovator we
meet a step in the phylogenesis of the human mind.</p>
<p>Looking back on this process of emergence, it seems clear enough what
has happened. The passionate urge to fulfil self-set standards will
appear completely determinate if we too accept the same standards as
real and valid; but it is also seen to be quite indeterminate, for it is
achieved by a supreme intensification of uniquely personal intimations.
Such is the logic of self-compulsion with universal intent. Action and
submission are totally blended in a heuristic communion with reality;
determinism and spontaneity mutually require each other when embodied in
the universal and the personal poles of commitment. We have no
difficulty in acknowledging this seemingly paradoxical situation every
time we are confronted with human greatness. Wherever men have truly
spoken in the name of truth, saying, Here I stand and cannot do
otherwise, we instantly recognize both the power of impersonal truth and
the greatness of a mind upholding it. We readily pay our respect to both
poles of such a commitment.</p>
<p>Difficulties arise only when we look at the fragments of the
commitment non-committally. If we ask whether Euclid’s theorems existed
before they were discovered, the answer is obviously No, in the same
sense as we would say that Shakespeare’s sonnets did not exist before he
wrote them. But we cannot therefore say that the truth of geometry or
the beauty of poetry came into existence at any particular place and
time, for these constitute the universal pole of our appreciation, which
cannot be observed non-committally like objects in space and time.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Another difficulty arises, for similar reasons, at the personal pole
of human greatness, if wc regard the innovator as a material system,
controlled by the laws of physics and chemistry. Such a vision traces
Shakespeare’s sonnets back to a pattern inscribed in the primordial
incandescent gases in which our universe originated; it is the Laplacean
idea of a universe determined from the start for all times. My answer to
this view is to accredit once more my capacity for comprehending
entities which are not specifiable in terms of their particulars—of
particulars which are themselves usually comprehensive features and
hence in their turn are unspecifiable in terms of their own particulars,
and so on. Thus the ultimate Laplacean particulars turn out to be almost
completely meaningless, and certainly cannot be said to determine any
significant feature of a universe enriched by emergent strata of
being.</li>
</ol>
<p>But I must elaborate this conclusion further if I am to take in from
its point of view the whole panorama of emergence from its first
beginnings. Admitting that no process governed by the laws of physics
and chemistry as known today can be accompanied by consciousness, we may
yet suppose that some enlarged laws of nature may make possible the
realization of operational principles acting by consciousness. It would
be unwarranted to retain then for structures operating on such
principles the conception of automatic functioning derived from our
present physics and chemistry. Since action and reaction usually arise
together in nature, it would seem reasonable, on the contrary, that the
new laws of nature, which would allow for the rise of consciousness in
material processes, should also allow for the reverse action, that is,
of conscious processes acting on their material substrate. Such laws of
nature would not comprise psychology, which is a convivial study of
mental operations, but their assumption would make it conceivable that
material structures should offer conditions for the occurrence of mental
operations and should account for their occasional failure. This
assumption would enable us to envisage the rise from inanimate matter of
sentient, motoric, perceptive individuals, and, at a higher stage, of
thinking, responsible persons. And it would allow us also to bring this
process of emergence into continuous alignment with the heuristic
strivings of innovators.</p>
<p>Looking back in this light on a process of human ontogenesis, we can
trace now the activities of the mature mind to ever further descending
levels of sentient effort. I have identified these levels of action
already before as the roots of the tacit component which participates
decisively in all articulate thought. We have seen there, and later also
in surveying the rising levels of biotic existence, that the outcome of
these actions is always indeterminate; for they are commitments which
have a bearing on reality to the very extent to which they are
hazardous. They are irreversible processes of comprehension, guided only
by vague maxims. Descending therefore from the person of a great man
down to the level of the newborn infant and beyond that to the lowest
animals, we find a continuous series of centres whose a-critical
decisions account ultimately for every action of sentient individuality.
Thus the personal pole of commitment retains its autonomy everywhere,
exercising its calling within a material milieu which conditions but
never fully determines its actions. Unopposed, the circumstances of a
commitment would overwhelm and wipe out the impulse of commitment; but a
centre actively committing itself resists and limits these circumstances
to the point of turning them into instruments of its own operations.</p>
