<h4 id="probability-of-propositions">4. PROBABILITY OF PROPOSITIONS</h4>
<p>The concept of a personal knowledge concerning matters of chance will
come out more clearly if we examine by contrast some current attempts to
avoid facing up to the fact of our holding a personal knowledge of this
kind. Thus we may deny that probability statements imply any reference
to objects and suggest that they are concerned only with propositions.
This interpretation of probability has indeed widely prevailed in the
modern theory of probability since J. M. Keynes first proposed it in his
Treatise on Probability, published in 1921.</p>
<p>Taking for our example Darwin’s investigation of the effect of
cross-fertilization as against self-fertilization on the height of
plants, we would consider in this light that its result is a proposition
H, ‘cross fertilization enhances growth’, rendered probable on the
evidence that can be summed up in the proposition E, ‘the mean of the 15
observed differences is 2.148 times larger than the calculated standard
error of the 15 observed differences’. Thus we would establish a
probability relation P(H/E) between two propositions, which is a belief
not about events but about a relation between propositions. Some authors
describe a result of this kind as conveying a certain degree of belief
in H based on the evidence E, and symbolize it accordingly by
PB(H/E).5</p>
<p>But this analysis does not correspond to actual practice or indeed to
any acceptable practice. Darwin’s intention was to establish the effect
of cross-fertilization on plant growth and not the relation of a
proposition asserting such an effect to a proposition about observed
heights of plants. When Rhine undertook to investigate the chances of
card guessing he wanted to find out whether extra-sensory perception
exists, and not whether there obtains a relation between the assertion
of its existence and the proportion of guesses recorded. What both these
investigators (as interpreted by Fisher) established is a probability
statement H, namely the contradictory of the null-hypothesis—which is in
each case the law of nature that they alleged in conclusion. But such a
result is something quite different from the probability of a statement
H, or the particular degree of belief in H which would correspond to the
observed evidence E.</p>
<p>This difference between a probability statement on the one hand, and
the probability of a statement, or the degree of belief in a statement
on the other, may seem elusive, but is actually quite obvious. Take the
throw of a die. I say that the probability of a six to be thrown is 1/6;
that is a ‘probability statement H’ There are six such probability
statements referring to the throw, such as ‘the probability of a one to
be thrown is 1/6’, ‘the probability of a two to be thrown is 1/6, . . .’
etc., all six of which I jointly hold to be true. If, on the other hand,
we are to make statements H about the throw that are not probability
statements, they must be of the form ‘a six will be thrown’, ‘a five
will be thrown’, ‘a four will be thrown’, etc. These six contradictory
statements are supposed to become mutually compatible and severally
acceptable, by being held not with certainty but with a degree of
probability or belief to which we ascribe the number 1/6. But obviously
nobody can believe that a die will fall with each of its six sides
uppermost at the same time, and no reduction of the degree of this
belief will make it acceptable. Nor is it true to say—as a matter of
psychology—that we believe that a die will always fall with a six on top
but are rather uncertain of this, while at the same time we believe that
it will always fall with a five on top but are rather uncertain of this
too, and so on. It is absurd to describe our state of mind in these
terms; and any attempt to do so can only be prompted by a desperate
desire to avoid saying that the chance of throwing a six is 1/6, which
would make an ambiguous and yet significant statement about an external
event. I conclude, therefore, that in so far as we arrive at probability
statements on the lines of the statistical method illustrated by
Darwin’s or Rhine’s investigations, or as made every day about the toss
of a coin, these are statements about probable events and not probable
statements about events.</p>
<p>This logical argument will gain in scope if we relate it to
psychological observations made on the expectations induced in animals
and men by exposing them to a variable series of events. Experiments by
Humphreys have shown that persons will acquire the habit of blinking
when a light is shown, both if the showing is invariably followed by a
puff of air blown into the eye or if the puff is administered only on
frequent occasions, at random. But the expectations involved in the two
habits were shown to be different when the administration of the puff of
air was eventually discontinued. Subjects trained according to the first
method rapidly lost the habit of blinking, while those trained according
to the second persisted in it through a larger number of tests. A vivid
illustration of this effect can be given in terms of a statistical
guessing experiment in which a signal light was followed by a second
light, either invariably or in 50 per cent of the cases, at random. On
the completion of their training the subjects of the first experiment
were guessing the occurrence of the second light correctly with 100 per
cent frequency, while those of the second experiment were guessing at
chance level, i.e. about 50 per cent right. The curves show that after
the showing of the second light was definitely discontinued, subjects of
group (1) soon ceased to expect that it would turn up again while those
of group (2) at first increased their percentage of positive guesses and
then comparatively slowly ceased to expect it altogether.6</p>
<p>The expectations induced in group (1) appear similar to those
affirmed by classical physics. Arising from a confrontation of the
subject with an unambiguous correlation of sign and event, these
expectations are sharply disappointed the moment the correlation is
discontinued and they are quickly abandoned in consequence. By contrast,
the expectations induced in group (2) appear similar to those of quantum
mechanics or any other probability statement such as refers, e.g., to
the spin of a coin. They are not easily disappointed by any turn of
events, though they are gradually weakened and eventually extinguished
altogether, when they can be upheld only by considering the events which
have actually occurred as having been extremely improbable.</p>
<p>We can relate these psychological observations to our logical
analysis of empirical inference by endorsing the process which they
describe as a rational mode of behaviour on the part of the subjects.
Having acknowledged that the observed subjects were forming justifiable
expectations and were abandoning them later on reasonable grounds, we
may try to enlarge this acknowledgment by analysing their performance in
further detail.</p>
<p>We will note then, in the first place, that both kinds of
expectations were held by the subjects with varying degrees of
confidence at various stages of their experience, and that their
confidence was finally reduced to zero by a series of consistent
disappointments. We note that the fiduciary element contained both in an
unambiguous affirmation and in the affirmation of a probability may vary
from a sense of unshakable certitude down to a mere lingering trace of
suspicion. I shall acknowledge it as reasonable to make either kind of
affirmation, and to entertain the corresponding expectations the more
confidently, the more consistently they are borne out by experience. I
shall acknowledge it as reasonable also to allow our confidence to ebb
away and gradually to vanish altogether if experience continues to
conflict with these affirmations, or if it can be reconciled with them
only on the assumption that the events that have occurred were
exceedingly improbable. In case we are testing a numerical probability
law, we may assess how improbable it is that a particular series of
observations should be compatible with that law. We may then follow R.
A. Fisher in trying to set a specific limit to the improbability which
we are prepared to countenance before abandoning the law in question.
But since no such rule can be firmly upheld, it merely expresses a
personal judgment that is subject to similar variations of confidence as
the original probability statement, the validity of which it was
intended to test.</p>
<p>This raises an important question; namely whether these varying
degrees of confidence might be themselves expressed as probability
statements, the intensity of our confidence being equated to the
improbability of the evidence having come to hand accidentally and not
attributed to the correctness of the affirmations for which it appears
to speak. In order to meet this suggestion, widely current in various
forms throughout modern literature on probability since Keynes’ treatise
of 1921, I have to digress on the nature of affirmations in general.</p>
