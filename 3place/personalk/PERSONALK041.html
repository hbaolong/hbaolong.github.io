<h4 id="heuristic-passion">3. HEURISTIC PASSION</h4>
<p>So far I have been describing only the selective function of
intellectual passions. This function is continuous with another which
also comes out clearly in the same text of Kepler. We may recall here
once more his words:</p>
<p>What I prophesied two-and-twenty years ago, as soon as I discovered
the five solids among the heavenly orbits—what I firmly believed long
before I had seen Ptolemy’s Harmonics—what I had promised my friends in
the title of this fifth book, which I named before I was sure of my
discovery—what sixteen years ago I urged to be sought—that for which I
have devoted the best part of my life to astronomical contemplation, for
which I joined Tycho Brahe . . . at last I have brought it to light, and
recognized its truth beyond all my hopes . . . So now since eighteen
months ago the dawn, three months ago the proper light of day, and
indeed a very few days ago the pure Sun itself of the most marvellous
contemplation has shone forth . . . nothing holds me. . . .13</p>
<p>Intellectual passions do not merely affirm the existence of harmonies
which foreshadow an indeterminate range of future discoveries, but can
also evoke intimations of specific discoveries and sustain their
persistent pursuit through years of labour. The appreciation of
scientific value merges here into the capacity for discovering it; even
as the artist’s sensibility merges into his creative powers. Such is the
heuristic function of scientific passion.</p>
<p>Scientists—that is, creative scientists—spend their lives in trying
to guess right. They are sustained and guided therein by their heuristic
passion. We call their work creative because it changes the world as we
see it, by deepening our understanding of it. The change is irrevocable.
A problem that I have once solved can no longer puzzle me; I cannot
guess what I already know. Having made a discovery, I shall never see
the world again as before. My eyes have become different; I have made
myself into a person seeing and thinking differently. I have crossed a
gap, the heuristic gap which lies between problem and discovery.</p>
<p>Major discoveries change our interpretative framework. Hence it is
logically impossible to arrive at these by the continued application of
our previous interpretative framework. So we see once more that
discovery is creative, in the sense that it is not to be achieved by the
diligent performance of any previously known and specifiable procedure.
This strengthens our conception of originality. The application of
existing rules can produce valuable surveys, but does not advance the
principles of science. We have to cross the logical gap between a
problem and its solution by relying on the unspecifiable impulse of our
heuristic passion, and must undergo as we do so a change of our
intellectual personality. Like all ventures in which we comprehensively
dispose of ourselves, such an intentional change of our personality
requires a passionate motive to accomplish it. Originality must be
passionate.</p>
<p>But the words of Kepler show us also that this truth-bearing passion
is far from infallible. Kepler rejoiced in his discovery of the five
solids among the heavenly orbits; he thought that the solar distances of
the six planets known to him corresponded to the sizes of the successive
Platonic bodies, as measured by the radii of inscribed and circumscribed
spheres. This is nonsense, and we would regard it as nonsense today,
however accurately it corresponded to the facts; merely and simply
because we no longer believe that the fundamental harmonies of the
universe are disclosed in such simple geometrical relations.14 But
though his view of reality led Kepler astray in this case, it was close
enough to the truth to guide him aright to the discovery of his three
laws of planetary motion. Therefore Kepler remains a great scientist to
us, in spite of his erroneous reference to the Platonic bodies. It is
only when he talks of such things as the mind residing in the sun which
listens to the planets, and puts down in musical notation the several
tunes of the planets, that we no longer regard him as a scientist, but
as a mystic. We draw here a distinction between two kinds of error,
namely, scientific guesses which have turned out to be mistaken, and
unscientific guesses which are not only false, but incompetent.</p>
<p>Intellectual passions, then, may be altogether misdirected, as were
those of Laplace in formulating his objectivist ideal; and even those
which lead aright, as in the case of Kepler, may be interwoven with
others that are inherently erroneous. A further example will confirm
this conclusion, by showing us once more how closely mingled are
truth-bearing and fallacious components in the intellectual passions of
even the greatest scientists, and in what sense we can yet distinguish
between the two.</p>
<p>In his speculations which led to the discovery of relativity,
Einstein was guided by his aspiration—stimulated by Mach—to liberate
himself from the misleading assumptions inherent in the hitherto current
traditional conceptions of space and time, and to replace these by a
frankly artificial framework in which the assumption of absolute rest
was replaced by that of an absolutely constant velocity of light.
Brushing aside the protest of common sense as the complaint of mere
habit, he adopted a vision in which the electro-dynamics of moving
bodies were set beautifully free from all the anomalies imposed on them
by the traditional framework of absolute space and time. Accepting this
intellectual beauty as a token of reality, Einstein went on to
generalize his vision further and to derive from it a series of new and
surprising consequences. This was an unfamiliar beauty in science, for
it accepted a new conception of reality. Electromagnetic vibrations
without any vibrating medium were an affront to the mechanical
conception of things which had prevailed in physics since Galileo and
Newton. The new beauty inaugurated the modern view of a mathematically
defined reality.</p>
<p>Yet Einstein’s Argus-eyed sensitivity was open to other clues which
did not allow him to accept this vision as his only guide. In the same
year (1905) in which his work on relativity was published, he solved the
riddle of Brownian motion by adopting a concrete mechanical conception
of molecular agitation. This theory, soon to be confirmed experimentally
by Perrin, re-established the reality of atoms as material particles,
which had been peremptorily denied by Mach’s operationalism. But the
mechanical character of molecular interactions, so triumphantly upheld
in this case, became a stumbling block when Einstein refused on these
grounds to accept the ultimate reality of quantum-mechanical
probabilities. His insistence that individual molecular events must be
determined by specific causes, seems to have been mistaken.15</p>
<p>So we see that both Kepler and Einstein approached nature with
intellectual passions and with beliefs inherent in these passions, which
led them to their triumphs and misguided them to their errors. These
passions and beliefs were theirs, personally, even though they held them
in the conviction that they were valid, universally. I believe that they
were competent to follow these impulses, even though they risked being
misled by them.16 And again, what I accept of their work as true today,
I accept personally, guided by passions and beliefs similar to theirs,
holding in my turn that my impulses are valid, universally, even though
I must admit the possibility that they may be mistaken.</p>
