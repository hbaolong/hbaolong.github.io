<h4 id="the-fiduciary-programme">12. THE FIDUCIARY PROGRAMME</h4>
<p>Our tacit powers decide our adherence to a particular culture and
sustain our intellectual, artistic, civic and religious deployment
within its framework. The articulate life of man’s mind is his specific
contributetion to the universe; by the invention of symbolic forms man
has given birth and lasting existence to thought. But though our
thinking has contrived these artifices, yet they have power to control
our own thought. They speak to us and convince us, and it is precisely
in their power over our own minds that we recognize their justification
and their claim to universal acceptance.</p>
<p>Yet who convinces whom here? If man died, his undeciphered script
would convey nothing. Seen in the round, man stands at the beginning and
at the end, as begetter and child of his own thought. Is he speaking to
himself in a language he alone can understand?</p>
<p>In the beginning many words were held to be sacred. The law was
respected as divine, and religious texts were revered as revealed by
God. Christians worshipped the word made flesh. What the Church taught
required no verification by man. When accepting its doctrine man was not
speaking to himself, and in his prayers he could address the very source
of the doctrine.</p>
<p>Later, when the supernatural authority of laws, churches and sacred
texts had waned or collapsed, man tried to avoid the emptiness of mere
self-assertion by establishing over himself the authority of experience
and reason. But it has now turned out that modern scientism fetters
thought as cruelly as ever the churches had done. It offers no scope for
our most vital beliefs and it forces us to disguise them in farcically
inadequate terms. Ideologies framed in these terms have enlisted man’s
highest aspirations in the service of soul-destroying tyrannies.</p>
<p>What then can we do? I believe that to make this challenge is to
answer it. For it voices our selfreliance in rejecting the credentials
both of medieval dogmatism and modern positivism, and it asks our own
intellectual powers, lacking any fixed external criteria, to say on what
grounds truth can be asserted in the absence of such criteria. To the
question, ‘Who convinces whom here?’ it answers simply, ‘I am trying to
convince myself.’</p>
<p>I have insisted on this before on diverse occasions: pointing out
repeatedly that we must accredit our own judgment as the paramount
arbiter of all our intellectual performances, and claiming that we are
competent to pursue intellectual excellence as a token of a hidden
reality, I shall yet try to elaborate the structure of this ultimate
selfreliance, to which this entire book shall bear witness. Let me
observe now only that this self-accrediting is itself a fiduciary act of
my own, which legitimates in its turn the transposition of all my
ultimate assumptions into declarations of my own beliefs.</p>
<p>When I gave this book the sub-title ‘Towards a Post-Critical
Philosophy’ I had this turning point in mind. The critical movement,
which seems to be nearing the end of its course today, was perhaps the
most fruitful effort ever sustained by the human mind. The past four or
live centuries, which have gradually destroyed or overshadowed the whole
medieval cosmos, have enriched us mentally and morally to an extent
unrivalled by any period of similar duration. But its incandescence had
fed on the combustion of the Christian heritage in the oxygen of Greek
rationalism, and when this fuel was exhausted the critical framework
itself burnt away.</p>
<p>Modern man is unprecedented; yet we must now go back to St. Augustine
to restore the balance of our cognitive powers. In the fourth century
A.D., St. Augustine brought the history of Greek philosophy to a close
by inaugurating for the first time a post-critical philosophy. He taught
that all knowledge was a gift of grace, for which we must strive under
the guidance of antecedent belief: nisi credideritis, non intelligitis.
15 His doctrine ruled the minds of Christian scholars for a thousand
years. Then faith declined and demonstrable knowledge gained superiority
over it. By the end of the seventeenth century Locke distinguished as
follows between knowledge and faith:</p>
<p>How well-grounded and great soever the assurance of faith may be
wherewith it is received; but faith it is still and not knowledge;
persuasion and not certainty. This is the highest the nature of things
will permit us to go in matters of revealed religion, which are
therefore called matters of faith; a persuasion of our own minds, short
of knowledge, is the result that determines us in such truths.16</p>
<p>Belief is here no longer a higher power that reveals to us knowledge
lying beyond the range of observation and reason, but a mere personal
acceptance which falls short of empirical and rational demonstrability.
The mutual position of the two Augustinian levels is inverted. If divine
revelation continues to be venerated, its functions—like those of the
Kings and Lords in England—are gradually reduced to that of being
honoured on ceremonial occasions. All real power goes to the nominally
Lower House of objectively demonstrable assertions.</p>
<p>Here lies the break by which the critical mind repudiated one of its
two cognitive faculties and tried completely to rely on the remainder.
Belief was so thoroughly discredited that, apart from specially
privileged opportunities, such as may be still granted to the holding
and profession of religious beliefs, modern man lost his capacity to
accept any explicit statement as his own belief. All belief was reduced
to the status of subjectivity: to that of an imperfection by which
knowledge fell short of universality.</p>
<p>We must now recognize belief once more as the source of all
knowledge. Tacit assent and intellectual passions, the sharing of an
idiom and of a cultural heritage, affiliation to a like-minded
community: such are the impulses which shape our vision of the nature of
things on which we rely for our mastery of things. No intelligence,
however critical or original, can operate outside such a fiduciary
framework.</p>
<p>While our acceptance of this framework is the condition for having
any knowledge, this matrix can claim no self-evidence. Although our
fundamental propensities are innate, they are vastly modified and
enlarged by our upbringing; moreover, our innate interpretations of
experience may be misleading, while some of our truest acquired beliefs,
though clearly demonstrable, may be most difficult to hold. Our mind
lives in action, and any attempt to specify its presuppositions produces
a set of axioms which cannot tell us why we should accept them. Science
exists only to the extent to which there lives a passion for its beauty,
a beauty believed to be universal and eternal. Yet we know also that our
own sense of this beauty is uncertain, its full appreciation being
limited to a handful of adepts, and its transmission to posterity
insecure. Beliefs held by so few and so precariously are not indubitable
in any empirical sense. Our basic beliefs are indubitable only in the
sense that we believe them to be so. Otherwise they are not even
beliefs, but merely somebody’s states of mind.</p>
<p>This then is our liberation from objectivism: to realize that we can
voice our ultimate convictions only from within our convictions—from
within the whole system of acceptances that are logically prior to any
particular assertion of our own, prior to the holding of any particular
piece of knowledge. If an ultimate logical level is to be attained and
made explicit, this must be a declaration of my personal beliefs. I
believe that the function of philosophic reflection consists in bringing
to light, and affirming as my own, the beliefs implied in such of my
thoughts and practices as I believe to be valid; that I must aim at
discovering what I truly believe in and at formulating the convictions
which I find myself holding; that I must conquer my self-doubt, so as to
retain a firm hold on this programme of self-identification.</p>
<p>An example of a logically consistent exposition of fundamental
beliefs is St. Augustine’s Confessions. Its first ten books contain an
account of the period before his conversion and of his struggle for the
faith he was yet lacking. Yet the whole of this process is interpreted
by him from the point of view which he reached after his conversion. He
seems to acknowledge that you cannot expose an error by interpreting it
from the premisses which lead to it, but only from premisses which are
believed to be true. His maxim nisi credideritis non intelligitis
expresses this logical requirement. It says, as I understand it, that
the process of examining any topic is both an exploration of the topic,
and an exegesis of our fundamental beliefs in the light of which we
approach it; a dialectical combination of exploration and exegesis. Our
fundamental beliefs are continuously reconsidered in the course of such
a process, but only within the scope of their own basic premisses.</p>
<p>Similarly, the decision which I have now stated, to give deliberate
expression to the beliefs I find myself truly holding, was duly
anticipated all during the previous parts of this book. As I surveyed
the operations of the tacit coefficient in the art of knowing, I pointed
out how everywhere the mind follows its own self-set standards, and I
gave my tacit or explicit endorsement to this manner of establishing the
truth. Such an endorsement is an action of the same kind as that which
it accredits and is to be classed therefore as a consciously a-critical
statement.</p>
<p>This invitation to dogmatism may appear shocking; yet it is but the
corollary to the greatly increased critical powers of man. These have
endowed our mind with a capacity for self-transcendence of which we can
never again divest ourselves. We have plucked from the Tree a second
apple which has for ever imperilled our knowledge of Good and Evil, and
we must learn to know these qualities henceforth in the blinding light
of our new analytical powers. Humanity has been deprived a second time
of its innocence, and driven out of another garden which was, at any
rate, a Fool’s Paradise. Innocently, we had trusted that we could be
relieved of all personal responsibility for our beliefs by objective
criteria of validity—and our own critical powers have shattered this
hope. Struck by our sudden nakedness, we may try to brazen it out by
flaunting it in a profession of nihilism. But modern man’s immorality is
unstable. Presently his moral passions reassert themselves in
objectivist disguise and the scientistic Minotaur is born.</p>
<p>The alternative to this, which I am seeking to establish here, is to
restore to us once more the power for the deliberate holding of unproven
beliefs. We should be able to profess now knowingly and openly those
beliefs which could be tacitly taken for granted in the days before
modern philosophic criticism reached its present incisiveness. Such
powers may appear dangerous. But a dogmatic orthodoxy can be kept in
check both internally and externally, while a creed inverted into a
science is both blind and deceptive.</p>
