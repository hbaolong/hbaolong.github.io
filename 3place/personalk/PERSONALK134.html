<li><p>Cf. Part Two, ch, 5, pp. 114–17.</p></li>
<li><p>This process is not a statistical observation. Statistics can
refer only to measurable parameters varying within a given population.
Taxonomy judges non-measurable combinations of qualities within a
population selected by the taxonomist himself with a view to the
presence of these qualities. Nor is it even true that what is widespread
is considered normal. Perfectly normal—as distinct from malformed or
mutilated—specimens of a species may be the rarest.</p></li>
<li><p>J. Ramsbottom, Linnaeus and the Conception of Species,
Presidential Address to the Linnean Society, 1938, shows that while
Linnaeus rigidly adhered to the fixity of species till 1751, he later
suggested a kind of evolutionary scheme. His first outline of a natural
system of plants was, however, already published in 1751.</p></li>
<li><p>A. J. Wilmott, ‘From Linnaeus to Darwin’, in Lectures on the
Development of Taxonomy, delivered in the Linnean Society, 1948–9,
published London, 1950, p. 35.</p></li>

Zoology, New York, 1953, p. 4.</p></li>
<li><p>ibid., p. 53.</p></li>
<li><p>G. N. Jones, Scientific Monthly, 72 (1951), p. 293. The number is
increasing rapidly, and not through subdivision of known species but by
new discoveries, particularly in the New World tropics. Jones thinks it
probable that we have not yet made the acquaintance of half the existing
species of plants.</p></li>
<li><p>See for example the account of the discussion held in London in
December, 1950, by the Systematic Association on the subject ‘Phylogeny
in Relation to Classification’ (Nature, 167 (1951), p. 503). The
tendency, approvingly stated by one of the participants, to regard ‘any
attempt to make a classification without a motive as a waste of time’
was the main concern of this meeting of taxonomists.</p></li>

<li><p>This is why the British Museum has compiled a collection of 15
million insects against which they can match any new specimen submitted
to them. Even so it requires the unique experience of the Museum’s staff
to carry out this feat successfully.</p></li>
<li><p>Statement by A. S. Hitchcock in Report of Proceedings, Cambridge,
1931, p. 228. Another member, Professor C. H. Ostenfeld, said (ibid.,
p. 114) that a species consisted of all the individuals the character of
which is in all main points the same, so far as the characters ‘which we
consider essential’ are concerned.</p></li>
<li><p>S. C. Harland, ‘The Genetical Conception of the Species’,
Cambridge Biol. Review, 11 (1936), pp. 83–112. A number of years later
we see the taxonomist still embarrassed by this charge. In Lectures on
the Development of Taxonomy (London, 1950, p. 81), John Smart describes
the increasingly delicate work of the modern taxonomist as follows:
‘ultimately, the systematist could do little more than say that a
species was such a segregate of organisms as he decided to designate as
a species.’ This, he says, ‘sounds absurd’, even though there is
evidence that ‘the really competent systematist had pretty shrewd
opinions in the matter’. And in 1954 Pantin (loc. cit.) defends taxonomy
against the appearance of thoroughly begging the question by referring
to the ‘competent taxonomer’ in the definition of a species.</p></li>
<li><p>John Smart, op. cit., p. 82.</p></li>
<li><p>See C. Wardlaw, Phylogeny and Morphogenesis, London, 1952,
pp. 99–102.</p></li>
<li><p>Some biologists, consciously opposing this movement, have argued
effectively that the art of recognizing kinds of living things is
fundamental to their science. Thus A. Naef (Handbuch der Vergleichenden
Anatomie der Wirbeltiere, Bd. 1, Berlin-Wien, 1921, pp. 77–118) has
developed a pure typology of vertebrates. Agnes Arber (Biol. Rev., 12
(1937), pp. 157–84) carried on the movement, initiated in Germany by
Troll (1928), for ‘returning to Goethe’ and extensively developed
Goethean morphology in The Natural Philosophy of Plant Form (Cambridge,
1950). J. Kälin (Ganzheitliche Morphologie und Homologie, Freiburg
(Schweiz) and Leipzig, 1941), stresses the ‘logical primacy of
morphology’, and O. Schindewolf (Grundfragen der Paläontologie,
Stuttgart, 1950) insists on the priority of systematics to
phylogeny.</p></li>

<li><p>1/200th of a hydra is able to regenerate the whole animal, while
in the planaria 1/280th and even less has been shown to regenerate
completely. A. E. Needham, Regeneration and Wound-Healing, London, 1952,
p. 114.</p></li>
<li><p>The pioneering experiments of Driesch have been greatly amplified
by his successors, particularly Hörstadius (Acta Zool., 9 (1928), p. 1;
Roux’ Arch., 135 (1936), pp. 69–113) whose experiments are
illuminatingly analysed by P. Weiss, Principles of Development (New
York, 1939), pp. 249–88. Hörstadius observed that meridional halves of
the sea urchin blastula regulate into normal, though small, pluteus
larvae. Though in the course of this reorganization ‘in general
vegetative material was used to build the intestine and animal material
to build the ectoderm, there is no detailed correspondence whatsoever
between the actual use to which individual portions have been put in the
experimental germ and their prospective fate in the normal germ’ (ibid.,
p. 261).</p></li>
<li><p>Discovered by W. Roux in 1888 (see W. Roux, Gesammelte
Abhandlungen über die Entwicklungsmechanik der Organismen. II, Leipzig,
1895, pp. 419–521). Later experiments by E. G. Conklin, greatly expanded
by Dalcq and collaborators, have, however, established considerable
powers of regulation at early stages of the Ascidian development,
particularly in the virgin egg (see A. M. Dalcq, Form and Causality in
Early Development, Cambridge, 1938, pp. 103–27).</p></li>
<li><p>The field concept was first used by Spemann (1921), in describing
the organizer; Paul Weiss (1923) introduced it for the study of
regeneration and extended it (1926) to include ontogeny. Cf. Paul Weiss,
Principles of Development, New York, 1939, p. 290. The most striking
manifestations of morphogenetic fields were revealed by the cultivation
of embryonic tissues, described by Paul Weiss (1956), see note on
pp. 338–9.</p></li>

<li><p>Recent experiments by Holtfreter (1951) and others, suggesting
that only living tissues act as organizers in the full sense of the
term, have been taken by some embryologists as a warning that causal
embryology must continue to rely on morphological knowledge. See
Clifford Grobstein in Aspects of Synthesis and Order in Growth, ed. by
Dorothea Rudnik, Princeton, N.J., 1954, p. 233.</p></li>
<li><p>Except that to the extent to which laws of nature overlap with an
operational principle it suffices to transpose the natural laws in
question into the form of an instrument serving a purpose acknowledged
by the observer. Cf. Part Four, ch. 11, pp. 331 and 342 above.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparative physiology shows that widely different mechanisms are
used by organisms for a single purpose, e.g. for digestion, breathing,
etc.; such mechanisms are defined, therefore, by their common
operational principle, not by their physical and chemical structure.
Cf., for example, the chapters in J. T. Bonner, Cells and Societies,
London, 1955, pp. 116–21, on ‘Feeding in Animals’, ‘Breathing in
Animals’, ‘Circulation in Animals’, ‘Excretion in Animals’, ‘Development
and Reproduction in Animals’, ‘Coordination in Animals’. H. Graham
Cannon (Linnean Soc. J., 43 (1956), p. 9) gives ample evidence that the
same operational principle—the filter mechanism of shrimps—is realized
in different species by quite different constituent members. Moreover,
corresponding (i.e. homologous) characters are produced in different
mutants by different genes and the same genes may produce different
characters (A. C. Hardy, Proc. Psych. Res., 50 (1953), 96). The earliest
notice of this fact, to which professor Hardy called my attention, is by
G. R. de Beer, ‘Embryology and Evolution’ in Evolution, ed. G. R. de
Beer, Oxford, 1938, pp. 65–6.</p></li>
<li><p>This term, to which R. S. Woodworth first gave currency in his
Dynamic Psychology (New York, 1918), in place of ‘instinct’, is not
always used in this sense in psychology.</p></li>
<li><p>William James, Principles of Psychology, 2, London, 1910,
p. 93.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent to which a false perception is corrigible it is an
error; to the extent to which it is compelling, it is an
illusion.</p></li>
<li><p>See p. 323.</p></li>
<li><p>Part Two, ch. 5, p. 76.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, learning corresponds to the drawing of empirical
inferences concerning natural regularities only if we assume that the
initial conditions of the learning experiment are maintained unchanged,
indefinitely.</p></li>
<li><p>This corresponds to classing empirical technology with natural
science.</p></li>
<li><p>Cf. p. 73.</p></li>
<li><p>Lashley, K. S., Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence, Chicago, 1929,
p. 133.</p></li>
<li><p>N. P. F. Maier, Frustration, The Study of Behavior without a
Goal, New York, Toronto, London, 1949, pp. 25–76.</p></li>
<li><p>I. Pavlov, Conditioned Reflexes, Oxford, 1927, pp. 290–1; also
Selected Works, Moscow, 1955, pp. 235 f. (from Skand. Arch. Physiol., 47
(1926), 1–14).</p></li>
<li><p>Numerous cases of experimental neurosis were reported since 1938
from psychological laboratories in America, and some from Britain.
Though the pathogenic situations are often described simply as
conflicts, it appears, particularly from the comprehensive studies of N.
R. F. Maier (op. cit.) that only such conflicts are effective from which
the animal endeavours vainly to escape by problem solving. This author
points out that, when subjected to opposite impulses which it can
clearly envisage as such, the animal may simply do nothing.
‘Frustration’ develops, therefore, only when the hidden promises of a
puzzling situation keep stimulating its vain efforts to gain
intellectual control over the possibilities assailing him.</p></li>
<li><p>C. F. Jacobsen, Res. Publ. Ass. nerv. ment. Dis., 13 (1934), 225;
cf. J. F. Fulton, Act. med. scand. suppl., 196 (1947), 617.</p></li>
<li><p>Fulton (op. cit., p. 621) describes the behaviour of the
chimpanzee after lobotomy: ‘The chimpanzee offered the usual friendly
greeting, and eagerly ran from its living quarters to the transfer cage,
and in turn went promptly to the experimental cage. The usual procedure
of baiting the cup and lowering the opaque screen was followed. The
chimpanzee did not, however, show its usual excitement, but rather
quietly knelt before the cage or walked around. Given an opportunity, it
chose between the cups with its customary eagerness and alacrity.
However, whenever the animal made a mistake it showed no emotional
disturbance, but quietly awaited the loading of the cup for the next
trial. The opaque door was again lowered, but without untoward effect,
and if the animal failed again it merely continued to play quietly or to
pick over its fur. Thus, while the animal repeatedly failed and made a
far greater number of errors than it had previously, it was quite
impossible to evoke even a suggestion of an experimental neurosis. It
was as if the animal had joined the “happiness cult of the Elder
Michaeux”, and had placed its burdens on the Lord.’</p></li>
<li><p>It is difficult to understand the customary condemnations of
teleology by neurologists, psychologists, etc., for example, when W. R.
Ashby, Design for A Brain, London, 1952, pp. 1–10, emphatically
renounces all teleological explanations in the very act of constructing
a machinery to explain the functions of the brain.</p></li>
<li><p>For a more careful formulation see p. 370 below.</p></li>
<li><p>The following parallel may illustrate this situation. We speak of
‘applied mathematics’ when a technology can be mathematically formulated
(as in electro-technics), and such an abstract technology is then
sharply separated from the study of the materials by which it can be
implemented. By contrast, chemical technology has no theory that could
be developed irrespective of the chemical properties of the materials on
which it relies. Hence the technical chemist’s subject matter represents
a fusion of certain operational principles with the material conditions
of their success or failure.</p></li>
<li><p>Robert Leeper (Amer. Journ. Psychol., 65 (1952), p. 478)
describes Hull as in many respects the major figure in learning theory.
Since then the rise of Cybernetics has increased even further the
attractions of a behaviourism based on a strictly mechanistic model. E.
R. Hilgard, Theories of Learning, 2nd edn., New York, 1956, p. 182,
acknowledges that Hull has set ‘the ideal . . . for a genuinely
systematic and quantitative psychological system’.</p></li>
<li><p>See p. 337 above.</p></li>
<li><p>E. C. Tolman, Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men, New York,
1932, p. 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind, London, 1949, p. 58: ‘Overt
intelligent performances are not clues to the workings of minds; they
are those workings.’</p></li>
<li><p>Using here the symbolism of an earlier chapter, we are making
here a transition from H/E, which utters my own commitment, to P(/HE),
by which I acknowledge another person’s similar commitment (Part One,
ch. 3, p. 32).</p></li>
