<h4 id="rules-of-rightness">2. RULES OF RIGHTNESS</h4>
<p>We have seen that animals can learn (1) to perform tricks, (2) to
read signs, (3) to know their way about. These activities were taken to
prefigure primordially the three faculties of contriving, observing and
reasoning, which are elaborated on the articulate level to the three
domains of engineering, natural sciences and mathematics. I shall have
to amend this scheme now to allow for the fact that only the physical
sciences are predominantly observational, while biology and the study of
mind and man have a more complex structure, in which observation plays
but a subsidiary role.</p>
<p>I shall have, first of all, to claim a proper place for the logic of
contriving. The logic of deductive reasoning has been systematically
studied for two millennia, and the logic of empirical inference has been
a major preoccupation of philosophy for centuries, but the logic of
contriving has found its way only into scattered hints. One might think
that pragmatism, operationalism or cybernetics had contributed to it in
their attempt to explain thought as a process of contriving. But the
endeavour to reduce all knowledge to strictly impersonal terms prevented
this philosophic movement from attending to our knowledge of contriving
which itself can never be impersonal.</p>
<p>We have seen that a tool, a machine or a technical process is
characterized by an operational principle, which differs altogether from
an observational statement. The former, if it is new, represents an
invention and can be covered by a patent; the latter, if it is new, is a
discovery, which cannot be patented. Contrivances are classes of objects
which embody a particular operational principle. For the moment I shall
deal only with mechanical contrivances and concentrate on things
complicated enough to be called machines. Clocks, typewriters, boats,
telephones, locomotives, cameras are the type of ‘machines’ I have in
mind.</p>
<p>A patent formulates the operational principle of a machine by
specifying how its characteristic parts—its organs—fulfil their special
function in combining to an overall operation which achieves the purpose
of the machine. It describes how each organ acts on another organ within
this context. The inventor of a machine will always try to obtain a
patent in the widest possible terms; he will therefore try to cover all
conceivable embodiments of its operational principle by avoiding the
mention of the physical or chemical particulars of any actually
constructed machine, unless these are strictly indispensable to the
operations claimed for the machine. This will extend the conception of
the machine to objects constructed from the most varied materials and
differing altogether in shape and size. Just as the rules of algebra
will operate for any set of numbers for which the algebraic constants
may stand, so an operational principle applies to any collection of
parts which are functioning jointly according to this principle.</p>
<p>It follows that the class of objects which could conceivably
represent any particular machine would form, in the light of pure
science—which ignores their operational principle—an altogether chaotic
ensemble. In other words, the class of things defined by a common
operational principle cannot be even approximately specified in terms of
physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>Unless I believe a purpose to be reasonable or at least conceivably
reasonable, I cannot endorse an operational principle which teaches how
to achieve this purpose. Technology comprises all acknowledged
operational principles and endorses the purposes which they serve. This
endorsement also appreciates the value of the machine as a rational
means of securing the advantage in question. The operational principle
of the machine now functions as an ideal: the ideal of the machine in
good working order. It sets a standard of perfection. Any ‘clock’,
‘typewriter’, ‘locomotive’, etc. can be judged by this kind of standard
to be a more or less perfect clock, typewriter or locomotive. The
conception of a machine exercises its evaluative function further, by
setting off against itself the conception of a machine that is out of
order. When a boiler bursts, a crankshaft snaps, or a train is derailed,
these things behave against the rules laid down for them within the
conception of the machine. So while this conception accredits certain
events as orderly performances, it condemns others as failures.</p>
<p>But it can say nothing else about these failures. The conceptions of
machines in good working order form a system which ignores the
particulars of failures—in the same way as geometrical crystallography
ignores the imperfections of crystals. The operational principles of
machines are therefore rules of rightness, which account only for the
successful working of machines but leave their failures entirely
unexplained.</p>
<p>Can we turn to natural science to supplement this unrealistic
approach? Yes and no. An engineer trained in physics and chemistry may
be able to explain failures. He might observe strains under which the
machine will break down, or corrosive effects which whittle its
substance away. But it would be false to conclude that the physicist or
chemist can replace the conception of the machine—as defined by its
operational principles—by a more comprehensive understanding which
accounts both for the correct functioning and the failures of a machine.
A physical and chemical investigation cannot convey the understanding of
a machine as expressed by its operational principles. In fact, it can
say nothing at all about the way the machine works or ought to work.</p>
<p>This point is fundamental for the general understanding of different
levels of reality and will therefore be followed up here, in respect of
the machine, more closely than this subject matter would justify by
itself.</p>
<p>The first thing to realize is that a knowledge of physics and
chemistry would in itself not enable us to recognize a machine. Suppose
you are faced with a problematic object and try to explore its nature by
a meticulous physical or chemical analysis of all its parts. You may
thus obtain a complete physicochemical map of it. At what point would
you discover that it is a machine (if it is one), and if so, how it
operates? Never. For you cannot even put this question, let alone answer
it, though you have all physics and chemistry at your finger-tips,
unless you already know how machines work. Only if you know how clocks,
typewriters, boats, telephones, cameras, etc. are constructed and
operated, can you even enquire whether what you have in front of you is
a clock, typewriter, boat, telephone, etc. The questions: ‘Does the
thing serve any purpose, and if so, what purpose, and how does it
achieve it?’ can be answered only by testing the object practically as a
possible instance of known, or conceivable, machines. The
physicochemical topography of the object may in some cases serve as a
clue to its technical interpretation, but by itself it would leave us
completely in the dark in this respect.</p>
<p>We could extend the physico-chemical topography of the problematical
object to include all possible future transformations which the object
would undergo under the impact of all conceivable circumstances. Yet
even this ensemble of all possible future configurations would still not
tell us anything from the technical point of view.</p>
<p>This result is crucial. I shall repeat it therefore once more in
concrete terms. We have a solid tangible inanimate object before us—let
us say a grandfather clock. But we do not know what it is. Then let a
team of physicists and chemists inspect the object. Let them be equipped
with all the physics and chemistry ever to be known, but let their
technological outlook be that of the stone age. Or, if we cannot
disregard the practical incompatibility of these two assumptions, let us
agree that in their investigations they shall not refer to any
operational principles. They will describe the clock precisely in every
particular, and in addition, will predict all its possible future
configurations. Yet they will never be able to tell us that it is a
clock. The complete knowledge of a machine as an object tells us nothing
about it as a machine.</p>
<p>I have said that rules of rightness account only for the success,
never for the failure, of things constructed and operated in accordance
with them. We now see, on the other hand, that physics and chemistry are
blind both to success and failure, since they ignore the operational
principles by which success and failure are defined. We identify a
machine by understanding it technically; that is, by a participation in
its purpose and an endorsement of its operational principles. We do not
exercise such a participation within a physical or chemical
investigation. Indeed, the understanding of the structure and operation
of a machine require as a rule very little knowledge of physics and
chemistry. Hence the two kinds of knowledge, the technical and the
scientific, largely by-pass each other.</p>
<p>But the relation of the two kinds of knowledge is not symmetrical. If
any object—such as for example a machine—is essentially characterized by
a comprehensive feature, then our understanding of this feature will
grant us a true knowledge of what the object is. It will reveal a
machine as a machine. But the observation of the same object in terms of
physics and chemistry will spell complete ignorance of what it is.
Indeed, the more detailed knowledge we acquire of such a thing, the more
our attention is distracted from seeing what it is.</p>
<p>This unsymmetrical relationship prevails also in the manner in which
the two kinds of knowledge can be fruitfully combined. We can make good
use of physical or chemical observations in order to deepen our
understanding of a machine, for example a clock. Having guessed that the
clock is a time-keeping instrument and gained some intimation of the
functions performed by its various parts—as of the weights which drive
it, the pendulum which controls its speed by releasing the escape, and
the hands which indicate the passage of time—we can proceed to examine
the physical processes underlying these several operations. Thus we will
establish the material conditions under which the parts can fulfil their
functions and which will explain their occasional failures. As a result
we shall be able to suggest improvements to avoid failures and perhaps
even invent entirely new principles of clock-making. But no physical or
chemical observations of clocks will be of any use to a clockmaker,
unless such observations are related to the operational principles of a
clock, as conditions for their success or causes of their breakdown. And
we may conclude quite generally that in our knowledge of a comprehensive
entity, embodying a rule of rightness, any information supplied by
physics and chemistry can play only a subsidiary part.1</p>
<p>Some physical and chemical characteristics of a machine, such as its
weight, size and shape, or its fragility, its susceptibility to
corrosion or to damage by sunlight, will be of interest in themselves on
certain occasions, for example to a carter undertaking the transport of
the machine. But this is about as much as the scientific study of a
machine can achieve when pursued in itself, without reference to the
principles by which the machine performs its purpose.</p>
