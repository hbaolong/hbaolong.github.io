<h4 id="the-organization-of-society">5. THE ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY</h4>
<p>The picture of society which I have so far outlined is like a newly
launched ship—a frame without an engine. I have traced the tacit
personal interactions which make possible the flow of communications,
the transmission of social lore from one generation to the other and the
maintenance of an articulate consensus I have shown also how the same
interactions gratify a desire for companionship, a pure conviviality to
which a participation in common rituals gives the firmest expression.
These features of group life suffice for the formation of a fellowship,
but not of an organized society. We can understand the latter only when
we recognize the framework of interpersonal obligations imposed by the
social lore of the group.</p>
<p>Yet the mere sharing of intellectual passions directed towards no
other persons establishes already a wide range of common values, which
are continuous with the interpersonal appreciations laid down by
morality, custom and law. Moreover, such sharing constitutes an
orthodoxy upholding certain intellectual and artistic standards, and an
undertaking to engage in the pursuits guided by them, which amounts in
effect to a recognition of cultural obligations. Finally, since the
passions expressed in a ritual affirm the value of group life, they
declare that the group has a claim to the conformity of its members, and
that the interests of group life may legitimately rival and sometimes
overrule those of the individual. This acknowledges a common good for
the sake of which deviation may be suppressed and individuals be
required to make sacrifices for defending the group against subversion
and destruction from outside.</p>
<p>At this stage, the framework of cultural and ritual fellowship
reveals primordially the four coefficients of societal organization
which jointly compose all specific systems of fixed social relations.
Two of these coefficients recall the two ways of satisfying intellectual
passions on an articulate level, namely by affirmation or indwelling:
the first is the sharing of convictions, the second the sharing of a
fellowship. The third coefficient is co-operation; the fourth the
exercise of authority or coercion.</p>
<p>These four titles refer to four aspects of society which must always
be seen in conjunction with each other, for only together can they form
stable features in the shape of social institutions. Yet in modern
society, based on elaborate articulate systems and on a high degree of
specialization, we find certain institutions which predominantly embody
each of these four coefficients in turn. (1) Universities, churches,
theatres and picture galleries, serve the sharing of convictions, in the
wide sense of the term which I am applying here. They are institutions
of culture. (2) Social intercourse, group rituals, common defence, are
predominantly convivial institutions. They foster and demand group
loyalty. (3) Co-operation for a joint material advantage is the
predominant feature of society as an economic system. (4) Authority and
coercion supply the public power which shelters and controls the
cultural, convivial and economic institutions of society.</p>
<p>Primitive illiterate peoples cannot operate such distinctive
institutions and present therefore throughout an intimate amalgam of all
four social coefficients. At this stage no fundamental tension can exist
between power and thought in society. Nor did such a tension arise even
after power and thought had been embodied in separate institutions, so
long as society accepted its own structure as permanently established,
as it did during the greater part of recorded history. For in spite of
many great reforms—like those of Solon and Cleisthenes, of Gregory the
Great or Luther, of Richelieu or Peter the Great—made during the first
2300 years of European history, a hierarchical social structure was for
the most part regarded as essential to the very existence of the body
politic. Only after the American and French revolutions did the
conviction gradually spread over the world that society could be
improved indefinitely by the exercise of political will of the people,
and that the people should therefore be sovereign, both in theory and
fact.</p>
<p>This movement gave rise to modern dynamic societies, of which there
are two kinds. When a society is resolved on a sudden complete renewal
of itself, its dynamism is revolutionary; if it aims at a more gradual
approach to perfection, its dynamism is reformist. In the rest of this
chapter I shall deal at length with the status of scientific truth and
of other intellectual values in these two kinds of societies,
elaborating thereby the distinction, at which I have hinted already,
between a totalitarianism which tries to fulfil the Laplacean programme
by subordinating all thought to welfare, and a free society which
accepts in principle the obligation to cultivate thought according to
its inherent standards. But I must make clear first, however sketchily,
how both types of modern dynamic society differ, with respect to their
relation to thought, from the static societies from which they have
emerged.</p>
<p>For this purpose we must acknowledge the difference between freedom
of thought and the recognition of thought as a real force. No static
society ever denied the intrinsic power and worth of thought: religion,
morality, law and all the arts were respected in their own right. Though
their enterprises were restricted by a set of specific beliefs which
they were forbidden to challenge, cultural pursuits flourished within
these limits. Moreover, the established orthodoxy was imposed by rulers
who accepted it also for their own guidance. Though the quest for truth
was restricted by the acceptance of certain teachings as indubitably
true, the obligatory respect for the authority of these teachings
implied a deep respect for truth.14</p>
<p>The intellectual control exercised by modern revolutionary
governments differs from this in principle. Its rulers propose to
re-shape society, including its thought, in the service of its welfare.
They deny thereby any independent status or free activity to thought,
even though they may in fact often admit its authority as a tacit
concession to common sense.</p>
<p>This is totalitarianism. By contrast both to it and to a static
society, a free society accords both independent status and a
theoretically unrestricted range to thought, though in practice it
fosters a particular cultural tradition, and imposes a public education
and a code of laws which uphold existing political and economic
institutions.</p>
<p>In principle, the free society claims the right of self-determination
for the purpose of self-perfection as absolutely as the modern
revolutionary regimes. Indeed, these aspirations form part of the
original forces that created the free societies; they stem from the
unfettered thoughts and generous feelings which overthrew the static
authoritarianism of the Middle Ages. Yet at the same time they have set
up a menacing contradiction in the free society that they produced. The
great movement for independent thought instilled in the modern mind a
desperate refusal of all knowledge that is not absolutely impersonal,
and this implied in its turn a mechanical conception of man which was
bound to deny man’s capacity for independent thought. Such objectivism
must represent the public good in terms of welfare and power and set in
motion thereby the self-destruction of freedom. For when open
professions of the great moral passions animating a free society are
discredited as specious or utopian, its dynamism will tend to be
transformed into the hidden driving force of a political machine, which
is then proclaimed as inherently right and granted absolute dominion
over thought.</p>
<p>The seriousness of this civic predicament—resulting in the last
resort from the inherent instability of our convictions—will be
presently explored in some detail. But I must expand my perspective
first by introducing explicitly the moral aspirations of man as an
extension of his more specifically intellectual passions.</p>
