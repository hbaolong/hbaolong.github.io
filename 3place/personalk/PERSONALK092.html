<h4 id="the-subjective-the-personal-and-the-universal">2. THE
SUBJECTIVE, THE PERSONAL AND THE UNIVERSAL</h4>
<p>The personal participation of the knovver in the knowledge he
believes himself to possess takes place within a flow of passion. We
recognize intellectual beauty as a guide to discovery and as a mark of
truth.</p>
<p>Love of truth operates on all levels of mental achievement. Kohler
has observed how chimpanzees will repeat an ingenious trick which they
had invented in the first place for the purpose of getting hold of food,
by way of a game in which they use it to collect pebbles instead. The
anguish suffered by animals puzzled by problems (of which I shall say
more later) demonstrates the correlated capacity for enjoying
intellectual success. These emotions express a belief: to be tormented
by a problem is to believe that it has a solution and to rejoice at
discovery is to accept it as true.</p>
<p>The passionate aspects of intellectual commitment become more
precisely circumscribed by contrasting them with other passions or
pervasive conditions which are not commitments. Intense bodily pain
pervades our whole person, yet the feeling of such a pain is not an
action or a commitment. When someone feels hot or tired or bored, this
pervasively affects his state of mind, but does not imply any
affirmation beyond that of his own suffering. There exist also purely
sensual pleasures which are almost as passive as these pains; but the
more intense gratifications of our senses come from the satisfaction of
our appetites and to this extent entail a manner of commitment.</p>
<p>On such grounds as these, I think we may distinguish between the
personal in us, which actively enters into our commitments, and our
subjective states, in which we merely endure our feelings. This
distinction establishes the conception of the personal, which is neither
subjective nor objective. In so far as the personal submits to
requirements acknowledged by itself as independent of itself, it is not
subjective; but in so far as it is an action guided by individual
passions, it is not objective either. It transcends the disjunction
between subjective and objective.</p>
<p>The structure of commitment, which serves as a logical matrix to the
personal, is most clearly exemplified by the act of consciously solving
a problem. Such acts emerge only at a somewhat elevated intellectual
level and they tend to disappear once more at even higher degrees of
sophistication. Problem-solving combines elements from the two adjoining
domains below it and above it, and can be best introduced here by
attending first to these two.</p>
<p>At the lower end of the intellectual scale lies the satisfaction of
appetites. Processes of this kind, as for example the selection of food,
may show delicate discrimination, but the capacity for this is largely
non-deliberative rather than guided by conscious personal judgment.
Similarly, the act of perception by which we notice and identify
objects, though sometimes requiring a marked effort of intelligence,
does not as a rule involve any deliberation but is brought to completion
automatically. Though appetites and sensory impulses are clearly
personal actions, they are those of a person within ourselves with which
we may not always identify ourselves. We have often to restrain our
primary desires and correct the judgment of our senses, which shows that
such sub-intellectual performances do not wholly commit ourselves. At
the upper end of the scale we find forms of intelligence in which our
personal participation tends to be reduced for quite different reasons.
Mathematical science is widely accepted as the most perfect of sciences,
and science as the most perfect of all feats of intelligence. While
these claims may be excessive or even altogether mistaken, they express
the inescapable ideal of a completely formalized intelligence, which
would eliminate from its manifestations every trace of personal
commitment.</p>
<p>A conscious and persistent striving for the solution of an articulate
problem lies midway between these two extremes. It canalizes the native
urge for achieving coherence, which we share with the higher animals,
into the heuristic manipulation of articulate thought. Science can serve
here as a leading example. The distinctive ability of a scientific
discoverer lies in the capacity to embark successfully on lines of
enquiry which other minds, faced with the same opportunities, would not
have recognized or not have thought profitable. This is his originality.
Originality entails a distinctively personal initiative and is
invariably impassioned, sometimes to the point of obsessiveness. From
the first intimation of a hidden problem and throughout its pursuit to
the point of its solution, the process of discovery is guided by a
personal vision and sustained by a personal conviction.</p>
<p>While originality conflicts sharply with the ideal of a completely
formalized intelligence, it also differs altogether from
drive-satisfaction. For our appetites are ours, and it is ourselves they
seek to satisfy, while the discoverer seeks a solution to a problem that
is satisfying and compelling both for himself and everybody else.1
Discovery is an act in which satisfaction, submission and universal
legislation are indissolubly combined.</p>
<p>Some discoveries obviously reveal something that already existed, as
when Columbus discovered America. This does not impair the measure of
the discoverer’s originality; for though America was there for Columbus
to discover, its discovery was still made by him. But the universal
intention of a radical innovation can also be represented as a sense of
its pre-existence. When a mathematician putting forward a daring new
conception, like non-Euclidean geometry or the theory of sets, demands
acceptance for them from his reluctant contemporaries, he shows that in
his enquiries he had aimed at the satisfaction of pre-existing standards
of intellectual merit and that he regards the product of his thought as
the disclosure of a preexisting possibility for the satisfaction of
these standards. Even in the natural sciences, radical innovations may
have to rely for acceptance on yet undeveloped sensibilities. The purely
mathematical framework of modern physics was not satisfying from the
point of view of previous generations, who sought for explanations in
terms of mechanical models. In order to prevail, modern physicists had
to educate their public to use new standards of intellectual
appreciation. Yet from the start, the pioneers of modern physics assumed
that the new sensibility was latent in their fellow scientists and would
be developed in them in response to the possibilities of the more
profound and truer outlook which appealed to this new sensibility. They
undertook to revise the current standards of scientific merit in the
light of more fundamental intellectual standards, which they assumed to
be pre-existing and universally compelling. All this applies of course
emphatically to artistic innovations.</p>
<p>Our appreciation of originality should make clearer the distinction
between the personal and the subjective. A person may have most peculiar
predilections or phobias, yet not be credited with originality. His
distinctive sensibilities will be regarded as mere idiosyncrasies; even
if he is altogether wrapped up in his private world his condition will
not be recognized as a commitment. Instead, he will be said to be
subject to obsessions and illusions, and may even be certified as
insane. Originality may, of course, be mistaken for sheer madness, which
has happened to modern painters and writers; and the reverse is also
fairly common, namely for people labouring under delusions to believe
themselves to be great inventors, discoverers, prophets, etc. But two
totally different things may often be mistaken for each other. It is
enough to establish here once more the principle which distinguishes
them: namely, that commitment is a personal choice, seeking, and
eventually accepting, something believed (both by the person incurring
the commitment and the writer describing it) to be impersonally given,
while the subjective is altogether in the nature of a condition to which
the person in question is subject.</p>
<p>We observe here a mutual correlation between the personal and the
universal within the commitment situation. The scientist pursuing an
enquiry ascribes impersonal status to his standards and his claims,
because he regards them as impersonally established by science. But his
submission to scientific standards for the appraisal and guidance of his
efforts is the only sense in which these standards can be said to
pre-exist, or even to exist at all, for him. No one can know universal
intellectual standards except by acknowledging their jurisdiction over
himself as part of the terms on which he holds himself responsible for
the pursuit of his mental efforts. I can speak of facts, knowledge,
proof, reality, etc., within my commitment situation, for it is
constituted by my search for facts, knowledge, proof, reality, etc., as
binding on me. These are proper designations for commitment targets
which apply so long as I am committed to them; but they cannot be
referred to non-committally. You cannot speak without self-contradiction
of knowledge you do not believe, or of a reality which does not exist. I
may deny validity to some particular knowledge, or some particular
facts, but then to me these are only allegations of knowledge or of
facts, and should be denoted as ‘knowledge’ and as ‘facts’, to which I
am not committed. Commitment is in this sense the only path for
approaching the universally valid.</p>
