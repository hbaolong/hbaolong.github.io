<h4 id="crystallography">4. CRYSTALLOGRAPHY</h4>
<p>I shall now turn to my last, but in many ways most telling example of
the theoretical appraisal of order in the exact sciences. This is the
story of crystallography and its application to experience.</p>
<p>From earliest times men were fascinated by stones of distinctive
shapes. Regularity is one of the distinctive characteristics which
pleases the eye and stimulates the imagination. Stones, bounded on many
sides by plane surfaces which met in straight edges, attracted
attention, particularly if they were also beautifully coloured like
rubies, sapphires or emeralds. This first attraction held the intimation
of a still hidden and greater significance, which the primitive mind
expressed by ascribing magical powers to gems. Later, it stimulated the
scientific study of crystals, which established and elaborated in formal
terms all systems of appraisals that are inherent in any intelligent
appreciation of crystals.</p>
<p>The system sets up first an ideal of shapeliness, by which it
classifies solid bodies into such as tend to fulfil this ideal and
others in which no such shapeliness is apparent. The first are crystals,
the second the shapeless (or amorphous) non-crystals, like glass. Next,
each individual crystal is taken to represent an ideal of regularity,
all actual deviations from which are regarded as imperfections. This
ideal shape is found by assuming that the approximately plane surfaces
of crystals are geometrical planes which extend to the straight edges in
which such planes must meet, thus bounding the crystal on all sides.
This formalization defines a polyhedron which is taken to be the
theoretical shape of a crystal specimen. It embodies only such aspects
of the specimen as are deemed regular and in respect to these it is
required to fit the facts of experience; but otherwise, however widely
the crystal specimen deviates from the theory, this will be put down as
a shortcoming of the crystal and not of the theory.</p>
<p>To each crystal specimen there is thus assigned a different ideal
polyhedron, and crystallographic theory proceeds next to discover a
principle characterizing the regularity of these polyhedra. This
principle is found residing in the symmetry of crystals. ‘Symmetry’ is a
word with connotations almost as wide as ‘order’. We may use it, applied
to objects, to distinguish an unsymmetrical face from another having
perfect symmetry. A scalene triangle is unsymmetrical, an isosceles
triangle is symmetrical, but an equilateral triangle is more highly
symmetrical than the isosceles triangle. Symmetry is used here as a
standard to which observed objects may approximate and which itself may
be said to possess different degrees of its own kind of perfection.</p>
<p>This kind of symmetry implies the possibility of transforming one
part of a figure or body into another part by applying to it a
prescribed operation, such as mirroring. By mirroring a right hand I can
transpose it into a left hand, and hence a body with two hands is
symmetrical. The fact that an equilateral triangle is more symmetrical
than an isosceles may be expressed by pointing out that it has three
planes of symmetry instead of one. Alternatively, we may introduce a new
symmetry operation by observing that the equilateral triangle can be
brought to coincide with itself by rotating it by 120° around a vertical
axis passing through its centre. We may readily think of symmetry
operations for other regular figures and, in extension of the same
principle, also for regular polyhedra. The example of the equilateral
triangle shows that the presence of three planes of symmetry, crossing
each other along one line and forming angles of 120° with each other,
will turn their crossing line into a threefold axis of symmetry. The
geometry of regular solids explores such relationships between
coexisting elementary symmetries and determines the possibilities for
combining such symmetries in one and the same polyhedron. The principle
of crystal symmetry was discovered by assuming that crystals contained
only six elementary symmetries (mirroring, inversion, twofold,
threefold, fourfold and sixfold rotations). From this it was concluded
that the 32 possible combinations of these six elementary symmetries
represented all distinct kinds of crystal symmetry.</p>
<p>The only sharp distinction laid down by this theory is that between
the 32 classes of symmetry. They are distinct forms of a certain kind of
order. As the ideal polyhedron of a crystal specimen exhaustively
represents the regularity of a crystal specimen, so the class of
symmetry into which the polyhedron falls exhaustively represents the
regularity of the polyhedron.</p>
<p>And just as the same polyhedron could fit innumerable specimens
disfigured by different flaws, the same class of symmetry can be
embodied in innumerable polyhedra constituted by an indefinite series of
surfaces having an infinite range of relative extension.</p>
<p>Each class of symmetry is a distinctive standard of perfect order to
which observed specimens approximate, but these standards themselves
possess different degrees of their own form of perfection. The 32
classes of symmetry can be arranged roughly in a line of descending
symmetries, from the highest cubic to the lowest triclinic class. The
variation down this series is extensive and only the higher classes
possess sufficient beauty to make their specimens valued as precious
stones.</p>
<p>We have here, in brief, the exhaustive formalization of our
appreciation of regularity in crystals, including that of the existence
of distinctive kinds of such regularities and of the different grades of
regularity represented by each kind. I shall postpone a further analysis
of the relation of this formalism to experience until I have
supplemented it by an account of the hidden structural pattern of which
it is today regarded as the overt manifestation.</p>
<p>The atomic theory of crystals defining this hidden structure, which
was prophetically mooted in the nineteenth and triumphantly vindicated
early in the twentieth century, has unified and greatly extended the
system of order enframed in the 32 classes of symmetry. In this theory
the significance of the planes and edges exhibited by a crystal is
further reduced. These distinctive features are now regarded as merely
indicating the presence of an underlying atomic orderliness, from which
the 32 classes of symmetry can be rigorously derived.</p>
<p>The principle of atomic orderliness is an extension of the conception
of symmetry. If an operation which brings one part of a figure into
coincidence with another part of it is defined as constituting a
symmetry, a repetitive pattern like that of a wall paper may be regarded
as symmetrical, in view of the fact that its parallel displacement
brings it to coincide with itself—except for the edges, which we may
disregard if the sheet is very large compared with the spacing of the
pattern. Such regular rhythms can be readily conceived in one, two,
three or more dimensions. The structural theory of crystals assumes that
they are built as regularly repetitive three-dimensional arrays of
atoms.</p>
<p>Such arrays, when taken to extend in all directions to infinity, can
be readily seen to possess symmetries of the kind observed in crystals,
and it can be proved that they can possess only those six elementary
symmetries which are found in crystals. Owing to certain alternative
possibilities of regular atomic structure not affecting the symmetry of
the crystal as observed macroscopically, the underlying
three-dimensional atomic patterns can have 230 distinctive rhythms;
though these are manifested in only 32 distinctive principles of
crystalline regularity.</p>
<p>We may now turn to the question, on what principles our acceptance of
crystallographic theory rests.</p>
<p>The theories of the 32 classes of symmetry and of the 230 repetitive
patterns called ‘space groups’ are geometrical statements. As such they
speak in terms defined only by the fact that they satisfy the axioms of
the theory. The spatial pictures by which we keep in mind their meaning
are merely a possible model which embodies this meaning. However,
geometry even in this form says nothing definite about experience. Its
acceptance rests primarily on our validation of its consistency,
ingenuity and profundity. But it does bear potentially on experience,
for there is always a possibility that experience may present us with
models for a geometrical theory. Such experience may be contrived,
consisting in an artificial model. An instance of this is the banking
firm described by Cohen and Nagel, having seven partners who form seven
managing committees, so that each partner is chairman of one committee
and every partner serves on three and only three committees. The
constitution of these committees can be shown to embody the seven axioms
of a geometry, so that all the theorems of this geometry apply to the
relations between the banking firm, its partners and the various
committees.11</p>
<p>Alternatively, the interpretation of a geometry may be found in the
natural order of things. Our conceptual imagination, like its artistic
counterpart, draws inspiration from contacts with experience. And like
the works of imaginative art, the constructions of mathematics will tend
therefore to disclose those hidden principles of the experienced world
of which some scattered traces had first stimulated the imaginative
process by which these constructions were conceived.</p>
<p>When experienced orderliness is taken to be an embodiment of
geometry, it may become possible to test its correspondence to
experience. The observation of relativistic phenomena has served as an
experimental test for deciding whether the material universe was an
instance of Riemann’s geometry formulated in space-time by Einstein’s
rules, when combined with the assumption of trajectories being
geodetics.</p>
<p>Take again our 32 classes of symmetry and the 230 space groups. The
32 classes define groups of polyhedra and the 230 space groups define
indefinitely extended patterns of points in space. These geometrical
constructions were originally initiated by a contemplation of crystals
and speculations about their atomic structure; hence they will tend to
refer to these matters of experience, and it is in the following up of
this reference by observation that any empirical grounds for our
acceptance of crystal-lographic theory must be found.</p>
<p>For the sake of brevity I shall limit my discussion mainly to the
theory of space groups. Supposing that the deduction of the 230 groups
is, on its own premises, correct; then experience can only teach us
whether or not there are in the world instances of atomic structure
which embody these premises. There may exist an infinite range of bodies
which do not embody them, among them even some (like disorderly solid
solutions) which form externally well-shaped crystals; yet this would
reveal no internal inconsistency and therefore cause no embarrassment to
the theory. Therefore, no conceivable event could falsify this theory. I
have already hinted that the relation of crystallographic theory to
experience is similar in this respect to that between alternative
geometries and the actually experienced universe. But an obvious
difference between the two relations of theory and experience lies in
the fact that there exists only one single material universe which can
serve as an instance of one among many possible geometries, while there
exist a great many crystals, each of which is an instance of one out of
230 possible space groups, comprising together one unitary theory. The
relation of theory to experience is in this respect more akin to that
between a classificatory system, such as that used by zoologists or
botanists, and the specimens classified by them. But in view of the fact
that the classification is based in the present case on an antecedent
geometrical theory of order, the relation between theory and experience
is perhaps even more akin to that established by a work of art which
makes us see experience in its own light.</p>
<p>A classification is significant if it tells us a great deal about an
object once this is identified as belonging to one of its classes. Such
a system may be said to classify objects according to their distinctive
nature. The distinctiveness of the 230 space groups, like that of the 32
classes of crystal symmetry, rests purely on our appreciation of order;
they embody in terms of specific symmetries the claim to universality
which we necessarily attach to our personal conceptions of order. Yet
this system was supremely vindicated, as was the geometrical theory of
crystals in general, by its classificatory functions. It has controlled
the collection, description and structural analysis of an immense number
of crystalline specimens and has been richly corroborated by the
physical and chemical characteristics which are found to distinguish
these specimens. It has proved itself a natural classificatory
principle.</p>
<p>Here stands revealed a system of knowledge of immense value for the
understanding of experience, to which the conception of falsifiability
seems altogether inapplicable. Facts which are not described by the
theory create no difficulty for the theory, for it regards them as
irrelevant to itself. Such a theory functions as a comprehensive idiom
which consolidates that experience to which it is apposite and leaves
unheeded whatever is not comprehended by it.</p>
<p>The application of crystallographic theory to experience is open to
the hazards of empirical refutation only in the same sense as a marching
song played by the band at the head of a marching column. If it is not
found apposite it will not be popular. Crystallographic theory may in
this sense be said to transcend the experience to which it applies. But
transcendence which renders an empirical theory irrefutable by
experience is of course present in every form of idealization. The
theory of ideal gases cannot be disproved by observed deviations from
it, so long as they are of the kind which we are supposed to disregard.
Such idealizations do in fact express an element of the same
contemplative appreciation of which the a priori construction and
acceptance of a complete system of symmetries is a fully constituted
example. We can be legitimately attracted by the concept of ideal gases
only in as much as we believe in our capacity for appreciating a kind of
fundamental orderliness in nature which underlies some of its less
orderly appearances. But in the theory of crystal symmetries
idealization goes beyond this. For the standards of excellence which are
developed by this system possess a much higher degree of intrinsic
significance than the formula pv = RT may claim for itself. It is not
merely a scientific idealization but the formalization of an aesthetic
ideal, closely akin to that deeper and never rigidly definable
sensibility by which the domains of art and art-criticism are governed.
That is why this theory teaches us to appreciate certain things,
regardless of whether we may find any of their kind in nature, and
allows us also to criticize these things when we find them, to the
extent to which they fall short of the standards which the theory sets
for nature.</p>
<p>We see emerging here a substantial alternative to the usual
disjunction of objective and subjective statements, as well as to the
disjunction between analytic and synthetic statements. By accrediting
our capacity to make valid appraisals of universal bearing within the
exact natural sciences, we may yet avoid the sterility and confusion
imposed by these traditional categories.</p>
