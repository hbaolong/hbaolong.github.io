<h4 id="chance-and-order">1. CHANCE AND ORDER</h4>
<p>IN the last chapter I discussed how science teaches us to decide that
a particular set of events has occurred accidentally, rather than
because certain laws of nature, which these events seem to confirm, are
in fact valid. I now want to urge that any such decision is based on two
different but mutually correlated appraisals. When I say that an event
is governed by chance, I deny that it is governed by order. Any
numerical assessment of the probability that a certain event has
occurred by chance can be made only with a view to the alternative
possibility of its being governed by a particular pattern of
orderliness.</p>
<p>It may help to bring out my point better and at the same time to
extend its generality if I introduce a fresh example of the kind of
statistical judgment I have in mind here. At the border between England
and Wales you pass a small town called Abergele. Its railway station has
a beautifully kept garden in which, sprawling across the lawn, you are
faced with the inscription, set out in small white pebbles: ‘Welcome to
Wales by British Railways.’ No one will fail to recognize this as an
orderly pattern, deliberately contrived by a thoughtful station-master.
And we could refute anyone who doubted this by computing as follows the
odds against the arrangement of the pebbles having come about by mere
chance. Suppose that the pebbles had originally all belonged to the
garden and would, if left to chance, be found in any part of this area
with equal probability; we could compare the large number of
arrangements open to the pebbles, if distributed at random all over the
garden, with the incomparably smaller number of arrangements in which
they would spell out the inscription ‘Welcome to Wales by British
Railways’. The ratio of the latter small number over the former very
large number would represent the fantastically small chance of the
pebbles having arranged themselves in the form of the inscription merely
by accident; and this would crushingly refute any supposition of this
having been the case.</p>
<p>But suppose that some years later, the thoughtful station-master
having died, the pebbles became scattered all over the station garden of
Abergele, and that on returning to the place we were to seek out the
previously eloquent stones and map out on a sheet of paper exactly their
present position. Might we not get into serious difficulty if we were
now asked once more: what is the chance of the pebbles having arranged
themselves in this particular manner by mere accident? The previous
computation—dividing by the number of all possible configurations of the
pebbles within the garden the narrowly restricted number of
configurations which represent their present arrangement shown by our
map—would again yield a fantastically small value for the probability of
this particular arrangement. Yet obviously we are not prepared to say
that this arrangement has not come about by chance.</p>
<p>Now why this sudden change in our methods of inference? Actually,
there is no change: we have merely stumbled on a tacit assumption of our
argument which we ought to make explicit now. We have assumed from the
start that the arrangement of the pebbles which formed an intelligible
set of words appropriate to the occasion represented a distinctive
pattern. It was only in view of this orderliness that the question could
be asked at all whether the orderliness was accidental or not. When the
pebbles are scattered irregularly over the whole available area they
possess no pattern and therefore the question whether the orderly
pattern is accidental or not cannot arise.</p>
<p>Another example puts this in a nutshell. It would be rational for
someone returning from a visit to an exhibition to relate the strange
coincidence that he happened to be the 500,000th visitor. He may even
have been offered, as such, a complimentary gift by the management, as
was the case at the Festival of Britain in 1951. But no one would claim
it as a strange coincidence that he was the 573,522nd visitor, although
the chances for that are even less than those of being the 500,000th.
The difference is obviously that 500,000 is a round number while 537,522
is not. The significance of round numbers can be seen in the
commemoration of centenaries, bicentenaries, etc. Everyone knew that it
was disingenuous on the part of the Soviets to convene an international
meeting in the summer of 1945 to celebrate the 225th anniversary of the
foundation of their academy, for 225 is not a round number.</p>
<p>My story branches out at this point in a variety of directions which
can only be outlined at this stage. One point of interest is that we can
see now why it is a mistake to say generally (as has been done) that the
probability of a past event to have occurred by chance in precisely the
way that it did is vanishingly small. You may justly speak of the
improbability of particular past events if you recognize in them a
distinctive pattern, for example the fulfilment of a horoscope—and if at
the same time you deny the reality of this pattern and assert instead
that the events occurred at random within a wide range of possible
alternatives, and were therefore much more likely to have taken a
different course. The appearance of the alleged astrological pattern
must then be regarded as the specious result of a very unlikely
accidental coincidence.1</p>
<p>This bears on the theory that the different living species have come
into existence by accidental mutations. This can be affirmed only if,
first you accredit the distinctive pattern of living beings as
exhibiting a peculiar orderliness which you trust yourself to appraise,
and second you accept at the same time the belief that evolution has
taken place by a vastly improbable coincidence of random events
combining to an orderly shape of a highly distinctive character.
However, if we are to identify—as I am about to suggest—the presence of
significant order with the operation of an ordering principle, no highly
significant order can ever be said to be solely due to an accidental
collocation of atoms, and we must conclude therefore that the assumption
of an accidental formation of the living species is a logical muddle. It
appears to be a piece of equivocation, unconsciously prompted by the
urge to avoid facing the problem set to us by the fact that the universe
has given birth to these curious beings, including people like
ourselves. To say that this result was achieved by natural selection is
entirely beside the point. Natural selection tells us only why the unfit
failed to survive and not why any living beings, either fit or unfit,
ever came into existence. As a solution for our problem it is logically
on a par with the method of catching a lion by catching two and letting
one escape. I shall fully elaborate this argument in Part Four,
ch. 13.</p>
<p>But let me pause here to point out that I have fulfilled in the
course of the previous survey the promise that I would generalize the
correlation between probability and order. I have done so by introducing
some instances of a new kind of order, not based on natural law—as were
the cases mentioned in my first two chapters—but produced by human
artifice, like the inscription ‘Welcome to Wales by British Railways’ at
the railway station in Abergele. This expansion of the concept of
orderly patterns was helpful to my purpose, which I shall now declare
more fully.</p>
<p>I wish to suggest that the conception of events governed by chance
implies a reference to orderly patterns which such events can simulate
only by coincidence. To test the probability of such coincidences and
hence the permissibility of assuming that they have taken place, is the
method of Sir Ronald Fisher for establishing a contrario the reality of
an orderly pattern. On these grounds I suggest, quite generally, that
the appraisal of order is an act of personal knowledge, exactly as is
the assessment of probability to which it is allied. This is, of course,
quite evident when the ordered pattern is contrived by ourselves; such
cases may help us therefore to recognize the principle asserted here and
to see that it holds quite generally.</p>
<p>This line of thought may seem in danger of defeating itself. If all
knowledge can be shown to be personal, it may appear that this does no
more than attach new labels to our customary concepts. This is avoided,
however, by the fact that the degree of our personal participation
varies greatly within our various acts of knowing. We can normally
distinguish in everything we know some relatively objective facts
supporting a supervening personal fact. For example, we may regard the
throw of three consecutive double sixes as an objective fact, and our
evaluation of this event as striking a coincidence as the stating of a
supervening personal fact. Similarly, the location of the pebbles in the
station garden of Abergele is an objective fact as compared with the
personal fact that the pebbles form a sentence in the English language.
I have already acted on this policy in my previous chapter when
contrasting the relative objectivity of classical dynamics with the more
massively personal knowledge of quantum mechanics and of probability
statements in general.</p>
<p>The modern theory of communications throws this whole matter into
sharp relief. Suppose we get twenty consecutive signals transmitted over
a line: twenty dots or dashes which we shall write down as twenty
noughts and crosses:</p>
<p>X O X X X O O X O X X O O O X O X O X X.</p>
<p>We may take it that this sequence of noughts and crosses is an
objective fact. But it may also be a personal fact, and here there are
two alternatives: it may be a coded message or it may arise from random
disturbances which are merely a noise. Communication theory tells us
that if the sequence is a message, the maximum amount of communication
that can be packed into the sequence numbers 948,576, or technically
expressed, 20 binary units. The figure 20 measures, as it were, the
amount of distinctiveness that can be imparted to a sequence of 20
choice between two alternatives. Much more distinctiveness could, of
course, be imparted into our sequence if we had ordinary numerals
running from 0 to 9 at our disposal. Twenty such digits would carry a
message of the magnitude 1020, amounting to about 66 binary units.</p>
<p>If, alternatively, our sequence of binary signals had been obtained
as a result of random disturbances, this noise would also be measured on
this scale and its numerical value would be 220 or 20 binary units. This
number is called the amount of equivocation caused by such a noise in
any messages transmitted through the same channel.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that modern communication theory, which has been
used by cyberneticists to build around it a fully mechanized model of
mental processes, turns out to be based on a clear recognition of
personal acts of intelligent appreciation, for the distinctiveness of
which it provides for the first time a quantitative measure. I shall
deal with this subject more fully later.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I shall carry forward the conclusion that the
distinctiveness of an orderly pattern—whether deliberately contrived or
found inherent in nature—is revealed by its improbability, and that as
such it cannot be strictly contradicted by experience. This, however, is
not to say that orderly patterns are subjective. My recognition of a
pattern may be subjective, but only in the sense that it is mistaken.
The shapes of the constellations are subjective patterns, for they are
due to accidental collocations; and the alleged confirmations of
horoscopes recorded by astrologers are likewise subjective. But, as we
have seen in the chapter on Objectivity, man has the power to establish
real patterns in nature, the reality of which is manifested by the fact
that their future implications extend indefinitely beyond the experience
which they were originally known to control. The appraisal of such order
is made with universal intent and conveys indeed a claim to an unlimited
range of as yet unspecifiable true intimations.</p>
