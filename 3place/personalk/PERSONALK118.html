<h4 id="is-evolution-an-achievement">2. IS EVOLUTION AN
ACHIEVEMENT?</h4>
<p>The conception of evolution as a process of fundamental innovations,
tending to produce ever higher biotic achievements, cannot be taken for
granted. For it is sharply contested by the predominant school of
scientific thought, a school which can claim to have produced most of
the brilliant modern work on heredity and the modification of heredity,
as well as some excellent studies of paleozoology. However, far from
being discouraged by it, I find this array of distinguished opponents
most heartening, for only a prejudice backed by genius can have obscured
such elementary facts as I propose to state here.</p>
<p>I shall argue on two lines, marked A and B, both of which have
already been indicated. In A, I shall try to establish an ordering
principle of evolution, by distinguishing the actions of such a
principle from the conditions which release and sustain its actions.
This argument is too general to be carried out fully here, and I shall
turn therefore to argument B by pointing out that the observed evolution
of human consciousness plainly exemplified this kind of active
emergence.</p>
<p>A. The predominant modern theory, usually described as Neo-Darwinism,
which I shall criticize here, regards evolution as the sum total of
successive accidental hereditary changes which have offered reproductive
advantages to their bearers. The sequence of hereditary changes, leading
to the replacement in succeeding generations of the original types by
better equipped variants, is described as ‘natural selection’, and the
‘force of natural selection’ is supposed to have brought forth the
successive forms of life that have eventually produced man.1</p>
<p>There is a fundamental vagueness inherent in this theory which tends
to conceal its inadequacy. It consists in the fact that we lack any
acceptable conception of the way in which genic changes modify
ontogenesis—a deficiency which is due in its turn to the fact that we
can have no clear conception of living beings, as long as we insist on
defining life in terms of physics and chemistry.2 My argument will be
based on a different conception of life. I shall regard living beings as
instances of morphological types and of operational principles
subordinated to a centre of individuality and shall affirm at the same
time that no types, no operational principles and no individualities can
ever be defined in terms of physics and chemistry. From which it follows
that the rise of new forms of life—as instances of new types and of new
operational principles centred on new individualities—is likewise
undefinable in terms of physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>To simplify the argument I shall concentrate here on the rise of
novel modes of operation, which are as a rule the most striking
advantage in the new forms of life arising from evolution. A theory of
evolution must explain, then, the rise of novel individuals performing
new biotic operations. But the question how instances of new biotic
operations come into existence, leads obviously back to the coming into
being of life itself from inanimate origins. It is clear that for such
an event to take place two things must be assured: (1) Living beings
must be possible, i.e. there must exist rational principles, the
operation of which can sustain their carriers indefinitely; and (2)
favourable conditions must arise for initiating these operations and
sustaining them. In this sense I shall acknowledge that the ordering
principle which originated life is the potentiality of a stable open
system; while the inanimate matter on which life feeds is merely a
condition which sustains life, and the accidental configuration of
matter from which life had started had merely released the operations of
life. And evolution, like life itself, will then be said to have been
originated by the action of an ordering principle, an action released by
random fluctuations and sustained by fortunate environmental conditions.
I shall now elaborate this analysis.</p>
<p>The stability of a living being has been strikingly compared by W.
Ostwald to that of a flame. One speaks today more generally of ‘open
systems’,3 but a simple gas flame contains all that is relevant. It
represents a phenomenon of constant shape, fed by a steady inflow of
combustible material and releasing a continuous flow of waste products
and of the energy produced by combustion. Once a flame has been started,
its shape and chemical composition can be varied without extinguishing
it. To this extent, its identity is not defined by its physical or
chemical topography, but by the operational principles which sustain it.
A particular collocation of atoms may accidentally fulfil the conditions
for starting a flame, but this accident itself can be defined as such
only by its bearing on the system of ordering principles which
establishes the possibility of stable flames.</p>
<p>Thus the potentiality of a stable flame bears the same relation to
any random fluctuation which ignited it as the ordering principle
inherent in the potential energy of biassed dice does to the randomness
of Brownian motion, as described in the third imaginary experiment in
Chapter 3 of Part One.4 But we must note the following important
difference. The fluctuation which leads to the establishment of an open
system does not vanish after the event, as does the Brownian impulse
which made the dice tumble into stable positions. The atomic
configuration which ignited a flame keeps renewing itself within the
flame. It is a fundamental property of open systems, not described
before now, that they stabilize any improbable event which serves to
elicit them. R. A. Fisher’s observation of the way in which natural
selection makes the improbable probable5 is but a particular application
of this theorem. The first beginning of life must have likewise
stabilized the highly improbable fluctuation of inanimate matter which
initiated life.</p>
<p>Owing to the slowness of evolution, no complete functional
innovations can be seen to occur within any observable period. But they
undoubtedly do take place over longer periods. There is a cumulative
trend of changes tending towards higher levels of organization, among
which the deepening of sentience and the rise of thought are the most
conspicuous. And in this sense we can acknowledge that certain lines of
evolution have been more effective than others; for example, that the
principle of an exoskeleton used by the arthropods offered less scope
for evolution than the endoskeleton of the chordates. But these
comprehensive operations of evolution are not observable within the
short span of contemporary experience, the less so, since any
indications of them are likely to be swamped by ephemeral genetic
variations which are taking place, as it were, in the interstices of the
dominant evolutionary trend. Hence the long-range operations of
evolution will not be noticed by the experimental geneticist, nor even
by the students of population genetics, and geneticists will have no
difficulty in explaining all hereditary variations observed by them,
without reference to the action of evolutionary trends.</p>
<p>Indeed, in so far as variations lack—or fail to reveal—any long-range
evolutionary significance, they can be described only by the present-day
theory of natural selection. They must appear as random mutations,
establishing themselves merely by their reproductive advantage. And this
explanation will in fact apply to a host of striking adaptive changes
which actually form no part of any long-range evolutionary achievement;
some intricate devices, such as those of protective coloration, will
rightly be explained in this manner. But I deny that any entirely
accidental advantages can ever add up to the evolution of a new set of
operational principles, as it is not in their nature to do so.</p>
<p>The grounds for this assertion have been laid down in the previous
argument and will yet be clarified later. Let me observe here only that
the theory of natural selection, by subsuming all evolutionary progress
under the heading of adaptation as defined by differential reproductive
advantage, necessarily overlooks the fact that the consecutive steps of
a longrange evolutionary progress—like the rise of human
consciousness—cannot be determined merely by their adaptive advantage,
since these advantages can form part of such progress only in so far as
they prove adaptive in a peculiar way, namely on the lines of a
continuous ascending evolutionary achievement. The action of the
ordering principle underlying such a persistent creative trend is
necessarily overlooked or denied by the theory of natural selection,
since it cannot be accounted for in terms of accidental mutation plus
natural selection. Its recognition would, indeed, reduce mutation and
selection to their proper status of merely releasing and sustaining the
action of evolutionary principles by which all major evolutionary
achievements are defined.</p>
<p>B. I shall now substantiate this general argument by focussing it
more fully on the rise of man.</p>
<p>Since we can know living beings only by appreciating their
achievements, we can know their evolution only by appreciating the
development of their achievements in the course of succeeding
generations. We have seen that such appreciations are integral to
biology. But the achievements of man’s evolution are exceptionally high.
While animals are acknowledged as centres of interest to themselves, we
owe respect to our fellow men. Hence we know man to be the most precious
fruit of creation—and hence also the knowledge of this fact lies outside
natural science. For we possess this knowledge only by our submission to
a firmament of obligations to which we believe all human beings to be
equally subject. On these grounds man’s supreme position among all known
creatures is safely established; but at the same time the study of man’s
rise extends thereby far beyond biology, into our acceptance of what we
believe to be man’s nature and destiny.</p>
<p>In order to contemplate clearly the process by which the rise of man
was achieved I shall trace the ancestry of one single human being to its
beginnings. Since each of the man’s parents, grandparents and more
remote forebears, have in their turn a definite set of parents,
grandparents, etc., a man’s genealogical tree comprises an unambiguously
determinate set of individuals. As the ancestral series recede in time
they descend to ever more primitive forms of life, and where sexual
reproduction is eventually replaced by asexual propagation they cease to
branch out and continue instead along single lines. They penetrate here
to the realm of unicellular organisms and beyond that to the realm of
submicroscopic, viruslike specks of living protoplasm.</p>
<p>I shall call this ancestral system an anthropogenesis. The bodies of
the successive generations of metazoa comprised in one man’s ancestry
appear as mere carriers of a continuously surviving germ plasm. The
carrier may possibly modify his charge; but even so, while he himself
dies and passes away, the germ plasm lives on mixed with that of another
parent in the body of their joint progeny. We may thus regard an
anthropogenesis in its entirety as a continuous proliferation of germ
plasm, from unicellular origins down to the germ plasm of the human
couple of whom the man in question is born. Since throughout the range
of sexual reproduction, the begetting of each new individual marks the
confluence of two branches of germ plasm, this proliferation of germ
plasm is accompanied by a steady reduction of the number of individuals
carrying the germ plasm. And the whole process of convergent
proliferation—extending over many millions of years—is brought
eventually to its close by the fertilization of the maternal egg
followed by the embryonic development and the birth and growing up, of
the man whose genesis we are contemplating.</p>
<p>This entire evolutionary achievement can be localized within a
circumscribed material system. Its operation must have taken place
within this system while interacting with its environment. In the light
of the logical analysis applied before under (A), the process must have
been directed by an orderly innovating principle, the action of which
could have only been released by the random effects of molecular
agitations and photons coming from outside, and the operations of which
could only have been sustained by a favourable environment. But in this
case we need no such abstract analysis to recognize that an orderly
transforming principle has been at work. We have direct evidence,
anticipating the result of our logical analysis, in the manifest rise of
human consciousness. From a seed of submicroscopic living particles—and
from inanimate beginnings lying beyond these—we see emerging a race of
sentient, responsible and creative beings. The spontaneous rise of such
incomparably higher forms of being testifies directly to the operations
of an orderly innovating principle.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter I have surveyed a series of ascending biotic
levels and exhibited in terms of these the logic of successively rising
achievements. This progression made me realize that biology can be
extended by continuous stages into epistemology, and more generally,
into the justification of my own fundamental commitments. And so this
ultrabiology went on extending further into the acknowledgment of all my
obligations. In the course of evolution this series should present
itself as a series of successive existential achievements. It should
show how in the course of anthropogenesis the descending lines of our
ancestors have taken on by stages the full capacities of personhood and
have inherited eventually all the hazardous aspirations of humanity. Let
me outline this process briefly.</p>
<p>The first small and yet decisive step towards man’s destiny was made
when ultramicroscopic, virus-like specks of living matter gained
standard shapes and sizes, presumably with a correspondingly integrated
internal organization. The bacillus which thus emerged carried the stamp
of individuality. Its self-controlled shape and structure, and the
physiological functions serving its survival, set up a centre of
self-interest against the world-wide drift of meaningless
happenings.</p>
<p>The next stage on the way towards personhood was reached by the
protozoa. The appearance of a nucleus within a bed of protoplasm
indicates an increased complexity of internal organization, underlying
an external behaviour of immensely augmented self-control. Protozoa move
about of their own accord and engage in a variety of deliberate
purposive activities. A floating amoeba emits exploratory pseudopodia in
all directions, which will catch food or else attach themselves to solid
ground and then drag the whole mass of protoplasm with the nucleus in it
towards this foothold. All these manoeuvres are co-ordinated: the amoeba
hunts for food.6 Thus it grows fatter until it reaches the size at which
its personal life ends by fission.</p>
<p>A further great step was achieved by the aggregation of
protozoan-like creatures to multicellular organisms. This enabled
animals to evolve a more complex physiology based on sexual
reproduction, a manner of propagation which greatly strengthened their
personhood. The story of the Fall presents a strangely apt symbol of
this event. For as one part of the body took over procreation and the
animal ceased to survive in its progeny, lust and death were jointly
invented. And as the achievement of metazoic existence established the
rudiments of this tragic combination, a finite personal destiny arose to
challenge the surrounding deserts of deathless inanimate matter.</p>
<p>We do not know at what stage of evolution consciousness awakened. But
as polycellular organisms grow in size, and as their complexity
increases with their size, a nervous system is formed to carry out ever
more extensive and elaborate operations of self-control. Already some
400 million years ago, at a stage represented today by worms, our
ancestors had formed a major ganglion in the forward tip of their
elongated body. The segment which first meets and tries out the unknown
world, into which the animal is advancing, thus acquired a controlling
position. It henceforth will direct locomotion and also control growth
and regeneration. A gradient is established thereby between the higher
and lower functions within the organism. An animal pole is set up which
uses the other parts of the body for its sustenance and as its tools.
Within this active centre the animal’s personhood is intensified in
relation to a subservient body. So we find prefigured the cranial
dominance which gives rise to the characteristic position of the mind in
the body of man.</p>
<p>The groping movements by which worms explore the path in front of
them are the precursors of the far more effective exploratory functions
of visual, auditory and olfactory perception. The use of sense organs
extends the animal’s area of mental control into the surrounding space.
But seeing is foreseeing and is hence also believing; perception
involves judgment and the possibility of error. Therefore, as the
personhood of our ancestors was enriched and expanded by the power of
new senses, it was intensified still further in undertaking to control
new hazards. The polarity of subject and object began to develop, and
with it the fateful obligation to form expectations based on necessarily
insufficient evidence.</p>
<p>The beginnings of such acts of judgment are shown in the capacity to
learn from experience. Some observers have traced this faculty back to
unicellular organisms, and it can certainly be found as far down as the
level of worms. But the capacity for learning was greatly expanded by
the advent of perception, which developed the rudiments of
generalization, contriving and understanding. A whole firmament of
self-set standards was prefigured here and soon the first faint thrills
of intellectual joy appeared in the emotional life of the animal. And it
became also liable to puzzlement and frustration.</p>
<p>But 500 million years of this growth and hardening of personhood
still only lead up to the threshold of true mental life, which was to be
achieved in little more than 500 centuries by man’s sudden rise from
mute beasthood. Teilhard de Chardin has called this ultimate
evolutionary step, by which human knowledge was born, noogenesis.7 It
was achieved by men who, forming societies, invented language and
created by it a lasting articulate framework of thought. Teilhard calls
this framework the noosphere. We have seen that the child achieves
responsible personhood by entering a traditional noosphere. Our race as
a whole achieved such personhood by creating its own noosphere: the only
noosphere in the world.</p>
<p>This was the second major rebellion against meaningless inanimate
being. The first had consisted in the rise of self-centred individuals,
predominantly vegetative and quite unaware of the rationality of their
performances. In these individuals the germ plasm lived on through many
evolving generations until, at last, noogenesis created a new fabric of
life not centred on individuals and transcending the natural death of
individuals. When man participates in this life his body ceases to be
merely an instrument of self-indulgence and becomes a condition of his
calling. The inarticulate mental capacities developed in our body by the
process of evolution become then the tacit coefficients of articulate
thought. By the forming and assimilation of an articulate framework
these tacit powers kindle a multitude of new intellectual passions. They
set in motion heuristic endeavours. They make us love human greatness
and accept as our guides those who have achieved it. By accepting such
teaching man testifies to the existence of grounds on which he can claim
freedom.</p>
<p>While the first rise of living individuals overcame the
meaninglessness of the universe by establishing in it centres of
subjective interests, the rise of human thought in its turn overcame
these subjective interests by its universal intent. The first revolution
was incomplete, for a self-centred life ending in death has little
meaning. The second revolution aspires to eternal meaning, but owing to
the finitude of man’s condition it too remains blatantly incomplete. Yet
the precarious foothold gained by man in the realm of ideas lends
sufficient meaning to his brief existence; the inherent stability of man
seems to me adequately supported and certified by his submission to
ideals which I believe to be universal.</p>
<p>This great spectacle, the spectacle of anthropogenesis, confronts us
with a panorama of emergence; it offers massive examples of emergence in
the gradual intensification of personal consciousness. At each
successive stage of this epic process we see arising some novel
operations not specifiable in terms of the preceding level; and the
whole range of them is unspecifiable in terms of their inanimate
particulars. For no events occurring according to the known laws of
physics and chemistry can be conscious. Alchemists used to attribute
conscious desires to the mating of acids and bases, but chemistry
accounts for such processes without any such imputation. The ‘action’ of
a reagent is no action, for it cannot fail; hydrochloric acid will never
dissolve platinum by mistake. Nor can self-regulating machines operating
in accordance with the known laws of physics and chemistry represent
human beings. For such machines are insentient automata and men are not
insentient automata. Some say that we merely speak in two different
languages when referring to thoughts on the one hand and to neural
processes on the other. But we speak in two languages because we are
talking of two different things. We speak of the thoughts Shakespeare
had while writing his plays and not of the thoughts of hydrochloric acid
dissolving zinc, because men think and acids don’t. It is obvious,
therefore, that the rise of man can be accounted for only by other
principles than those known today to physics and chemistry. If this be
vitalism, then vitalism is mere common sense, which can be ignored only
by a truculently bigotted mechanistic outlook.8 And so long as we can
form no idea of the way a material system may become a conscious,
responsible person, it is an empty pretence to suggest that we have an
explanation for the descent of man. Darwinism has diverted attention for
a century from the descent of man by investigating the conditions of
evolution and overlooking its action. Evolution can be understood only
as a feat of emergence.</p>
