<h4 id="morphogenesis">3. MORPHOGENESIS</h4>
<p>We ascend to the second level of biological achievement, by passing
from the study of typical shapes to the science dealing with their
coming into being: from the appraisal of living forms to the appraisal
of the processes of regeneration and embryonic growth.</p>
<p>Regeneration is the restoration of a mutilated organism. Some lower
animals, like hydra or planaria, have exceptional powers of
regeneration, so that tiny pieces of their body will regenerate to
complete individuals.24 This is a manner of vegetative, a-sexual
reproduction, commonly found in plants. It forms a transition from
regeneration to sexual ontogenesis, which may be regarded as the
regeneration of a complete individual from a fragment formed by the
fusion of two parental gametes. The fact discovered by Driesch that any
cell or cell-group, detached from the embryo of a sea urchin at the
stage of segmentation, grows into a complete embryo is another extension
of regeneration into ontogenesis.25</p>
<p>But complete regeneration is not universal, and at the limits set to
regeneration we meet another principle of morphogenesis, which replaces
the equipotentiality of all detachable fragments by a system of fixed
potentialities. If the fertilized Ascidian egg in the two or four cell
stage is cut in two, each half develops only into half an embryo.26
Though this type of ontogenesis is never free of regulative tendencies,
its principle can be clearly distinguished as a pattern of independently
proceeding processes of growth. The organism is built up in sections
which must fit together and be ready to function together when the
moment arrives for it. Such a mosaic of independently proceeding
interlocking sequences corresponds to the conception of ontogenesis
which Roux and Weismann had formulated and made universally current
before Driesch’s observations on equipotentiality.</p>
<p>The regulative principle of Driesch and the mosaic principle of
Roux-Weisman actually operate in combination. This is revealed in
Spemann’s principle of localized embryonic organizers. Spemann found
that in the newt embryo at the gastrula stage there is a certain region
adjoining the entrance of the primitive gut which dominates the further
segmentation of the embryo. If the embryo is cut up, any part of it in
which this dominant region is included—or in which it is engrafted—will
proceed to develop further, while in the embryonic tissue from which it
is eliminated, individuation comes to a stop. Thus the dominant region,
which is the seat of the organizer, moulds a whole region under its
control into one complete embryo, irrespective of any previously
differentiated character of its several component cells, which respond
equipotentially to the organizer’s stimulus. The effect of this stimulus
on the area under its control is ascribed to the organizer’s
morphogenetic field.27 The morphogenetic powers of the individual are
localized at this stage in a single organizer; but presently this centre
splits up into sub-centres of organization, each of which controls by
its field the development of one section of the embryo. Later, these
sub-organizers divide up in their turn by stages into secondary, and
possibly tertiary, specialized sub-organizers, each of which controls
the development of a limb, or part of a limb, or of some other organ or
feature emerging from the progressive differentiation of the individual.
A segregated area provided with its own organizer may be cut off with it
and will then go on differentiating in isolation—producing, for example,
an isolated limb. At this higher stage the development of the embryo may
be regarded as a mosaic of interlocking independent sequences, each
controlled by its organizer, while equipotentiality has been reduced
within the confines of the several morphogenetic fields controlled by
their separate organizers. This mosaic structure prefigures the fixed
localization of specific regenerative powers found in the adult higher
animal.</p>
<p>But to complete this picture of morphogenesis even in the crudest
outline, we must yet add the fact that embryonic tissues do not always
submit unconditionally to the field of an organizer. This preparedness
was defined from embryological observations by Waddington and called the
‘competence’ of the tissue.28 As the result of his grafting experiments,
P. Weiss established more generally that ‘a field cannot make any cell
produce any specific response unless that cell is intrinsically prepared
to do so’.29 Owing to this condition, the part played by the organizer
may be reduced to a mere evocation of the potentialities preformed in
the tissue subjected to its influence. This opens up a wide range of
rivalry between the morphogenetic potentialities that are proper to an
embryonic tissue and those induced in it by the dominant influence of
adjacent tissues.</p>
<p>All these principles of morphogenesis were discovered by the new
experimental methods applied for the first time by Wilhelm Roux in
1885.30 The work was based throughout on a previous knowledge of
descriptive embryology, which relied in its turn on a previous knowledge
of systematic morphology. It was these descriptive sciences, therefore,
that jointly set the standards for appraising the achievement of normal
shapes by normal embryonic stages, and experimental embryology was thus
an attempt to analyse hitherto descriptively defined performances. The
morphogenetic principles sketched out here may accordingly be taken to
define operations for the achievement of ontogenetic success conceived
in morphological terms. In the pursuit of this study several factors of
form-achievement are tested in isolation and under variable conditions,
and their operation observed also by experiments of regeneration, of
transplantation, of the influence of toxic media, etc. While the
investigation will thus extend to the production of abnormal forms,
these processes derive their interest from their bearing on normal
development.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter I have distinguished two kinds of biological
achievements, namely, (1) achievements performed by the rational
concurrence of several parts with fixed functions and (2) achievements
performed by the equipotential interplay of all parts of a system. In
morphogenesis the first, machine-like, type is present in the stratagem
of independent interlocking morphogenetic sequences, based on a mosaic
of fixed potentialities; the second, integrative, type is found in the
morphogenetic achievements induced by the field of an organizer, as well
as in the autonomous morphogenetic responses of isolated tissues.
Embryogenesis appears to be a comprehensive achievement due to the
rational combination of these two types of rational principles.</p>
<p>The analysis of the process by which living beings are formed
corresponds to the logic of achievement, as illustrated by the manner in
which we find out how a machine works. We must start from some anterior
knowledge of the system’s total performance and take the system apart
with a view to discovering how each part functions in conjunction with
the other parts. The framework of any such analysis is logically fixed
by the problem which evoked it. Its content may be extended indefinitely
and it may penetrate thereby ever further into the physical and chemical
mechanism of morphogenesis; but its meaning will always lie in its
bearing on living structures that are true to type, emerging from a
mosaic of morphogenetic fields</p>
<p>The meaning of experimental embryology is thus doubly dependent on
personal knowledge: both in respect of the unspecifiable knowledge of
true shapes, and in respect of the appreciation of the process by which
highly significant shapes and structures are brought into existence.
This situation has caused uneasiness among scientists.
‘Morphogenesis’—complains Paul Weiss—‘is still in the transition phase
from descriptive “natural history” to analytical science.’ He finds that
when modern physical and chemical tools of great precision are applied
to problems formulated in such less precise terms, the results are
equally imprecise and ambiguous.31 This complaint was voiced even more
radically by F. S. C. Northrop and H. S. Burr in a summary of their
electro-dynamic theory of life, published in 1937.32 Physico-chemical
explanations, they suggest, correspond to a Democritean philosophy of
science, while ‘perceived organization’ is an Aristotelian concept. But:
The Aristotelian and Democritean philosophies of science do not
combine.’ Hence we are asked to replace in biology the visible
appearance of organisms by an observation of the electrodynamic field
produced by them. C. M. Child had insisted likewise that morphological
differentiation must be defined in quantitative terms, since otherwise
we are inevitably led to ‘barren neo-vitalistic assumptions’.33</p>
<p>Throughout this literature the word ‘vitalistic’ is used as a term of
condemnation, even as Wöhler and Liebig used it, for the purpose of
discrediting evidence which threatened a more objectivistic framework.34
However, in this case no such objectivistic framework exists. No one has
yet seriously envisaged that we should study living beings without
noticing them; yet as soon as we do notice them we are relying on those
very features which a ‘Democritean’ science must ignore. Indeed, a
complete ‘Democritean’ or Laplacean knowledge can tell us nothing
without relying on our personal knowledge of these comprehensive
features. Suppose we were given a complete topographical chart of all
physico-chemical changes taking place in our surroundings. It would
require a superhuman feat of insight to discover from this information
the fact that there are somewhere such things as chickens, which are
hatched from eggs. But suppose we could do this—that we could achieve
this feat and became familiar through it with chickens and their
hatching from eggs—we should still have gained only the same kind of
comprehensive view of morphogenesis as our ordinary insight conveys to
us.</p>
<p>But—we may be asked—could the shape of chickens, eggs, etc. not
conceivably be determined in mathematical terms? Could we not give then
an exact and strictly objective account of morphogenesis? No, we could
not; for even on this fantastic assumption (which Northrop and Burr seem
to have envisaged in their own way) we would be still ultimately relying
on ordinary morphological observations. Normal shapes—as distinct from
abnormal, malformed, stunted shapes—would have to be identified by our
own standards of rightness before they could be defined in mathematical
terms. Mathematical relations are, like the processes of physics and
chemistry, neutral in respect to morphogenetic success or failure; these
alternatives must therefore be identified by ourselves before we can
analyse them in terms of mathematics or physics and chemistry.35</p>
<p>We may conclude that the insights by which we recognize life in
individual plants and animals, and distinguish their several kinds—and
by which we appraise them as normal or abnormal, establishing thereby
the success or failure of the process by which they come into
existence—that these insights reveal a reality to which we have access
by no other channels, and that the mechanism of morphogenesis can
therefore never amount to anything but the observation and understanding
of patterns and processes expressly bearing on that reality.</p>
