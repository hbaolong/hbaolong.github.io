<h4 id="varieties-of-commitment">9. VARIETIES OF COMMITMENT</h4>
<p>Within the framework of commitment, to say that a sentence is true is
to authorize its assertion. Truth becomes the rightness of an action;
and the verification of a statement is transposed into giving reasons
for deciding to accept it, though these reasons will never be wholly
specifiable. We must commit each moment of our lives irrevocably on
grounds which, if time could be suspended, would invariably prove
inadequate; but our total responsibility for disposing of ourselves
makes these objectively inadequate grounds compelling.</p>
<p>Truth conceived as the rightness of an action allows for any degree
of personal participation in knowing what is being known. Remember the
panorama of these participations. Our heuristic self-giving is
invariably impassioned: its guide to reality is intellectual beauty.
Mathematical physics assimilates experience to beautiful systems of
indeterminate bearing. Its application to experience may be strictly
predictive within certain not strictly definable conditions.
Alternatively, it may merely express a numerically graded expectation of
chances; or provide only—as in crystallography—a system of perfect order
by which objects can be illuminatingly classified and appraised. Pure
mathematics attenuates empirical references to mere hints within a
system of conceptions and operations constructed in the light of the
intellectual beauty of the system. The act of acceptance becomes here
entirely dedicatory. The joy of grasping mathematics induces the mind to
expand into an ever deeper understanding of it and to live henceforth in
active preoccupation with its problems.</p>
<p>Moving further in this direction we enter on the domain of the arts.
Once truth is equated with the rightness of mental acceptance, the
transition from science to the arts is gradual. Authentic feeling and
authentic experience jointly guide all intellectual achievements; so
that from observing scientific facts within a rigid theoretical
framework we can move by degrees towards dwelling within a harmonious
framework of colours, of sounds or imagery, which merely recall objects
and echo emotions experienced before. As we pass thus from verification
to validation and rely increasingly on internal rather than external
evidence, the structure of commitment remains unchanged but its depth
becomes greater. The existential changes accepted by acquiring
familiarity with new forms of art are more comprehensive than those
involved in getting to know a new scientific theory.</p>
<p>A parallel movement takes place (as we shall see) in passing from the
relatively impersonal observation of inanimate objects to the
understanding of living beings and the appreciation of originality and
responsibility in other persons. These two movements are combined in the
transition from the relatively objective study of things to the writing
of history and the critical study of art.</p>
<p>The growth of the modern mind within these great articulate systems
is secured by the cultural institutions of society. A complex social
lore can be transmitted and developed only by a vast array of
specialists. Their leadership evokes some measure of participation in
their thought and feeling by all members of society. The civic culture
of society is even more tightly woven into the structure of society. The
laws and the morality of a society compel its members to live within
their framework. A society which accepts this position in relation to
thought is committed as a whole to the standards by which thought is
currently accepted in it as valid. My analysis of commitment is itself a
profession of faith addressed to such a society by one of its members,
who wishes to safeguard its continued existence, by making it realize
and resolutely sustain its own commitment, with all its hopes and
infinite hazards.</p>
