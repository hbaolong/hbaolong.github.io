<h4 id="sign-posting">1. SIGN-POSTING</h4>
<p>THE previous chapter was a digression. Having acknowledged in Part
One the ubiquitous participation of the scientist in upholding the
affirmations of science, I wanted to investigate the origins of this
personal coefficient by tracing it back to the very act of uttering
speech. In order to find this juncture the enquiry had to penetrate
beyond it, to the inarticulate levels of intelligence of the animal and
the infant, in which the personal coefficient of spoken knowledge is
primordially preformed. Pursuing the roots of this tacit intelligence
even further, we recognized an active principle which controls and
sustains it. As far down the scale of life as the worms and even perhaps
the amoeba, we meet a general alertness of animals, not directed towards
any specific satisfaction, but merely exploring what is there; an urge
to achieve intellectual control over the situations confronting it. Here
at last, in the logical structure of such exploring—and of visual
perception—we found prefigured that combination of the active shaping of
knowledge with its acceptance as a token of reality, which we recognize
as a distinctive feature of all personal knowing. This is the principle
which guides all skills and connoisseurship, and informs all articulate
knowing by way of the ubiquitous tacit coefficient on which spoken
utterances must rely for their guidance and confirmation.</p>
<p>The tracing of personal knowledge on these lines, through all spoken
utterances and further back to the active principles of animal life, has
shown that the tacit intellectual powers which we share with animals and
infants suffice to account in a first approximation for the immense
expansion in the scope of human knowledge opened up by the acquisition
of speech. This approximation has, at any rate, the advantage of
representing separately those aspects of articulate thought which
require no striking expansion of tacit powers beyond those common to
animals. But there are other constituents of thought, and of science
itself, which are guided by tacit powers far surpassing the range of
animal intelligence, and to these I must now turn.</p>
<p>The powers in question would have inevitably forced themselves upon
our attention before this, had I not limited my study so far to the
affirmative use of language, in which such powers are least prominent.
The expressive and interactive uses of language obviously present us
with tacit powers beyond those of animals or infants. Works of art or
social imperatives have a manifest emotional force, evoked within an
articulate culture to which no speechless being has access. But we have
met with such powers even in the affirmative use of language itself. The
affirmation of a great scientific theory is in part an expression of
delight. The theory has an inarticulate component acclaiming its beauty,
and this is essential to the belief that the theory is true. No animal
can appreciate the intellectual beauties of science.</p>
<p>It is true that the active principle of animal life, in which I have
found prefigured all intellectual strivings of man, already sounds a
passionate note. Köhler clearly demonstrated that chimpanzees derive
pleasure from the discovery of a new ingenious manipulation, quite apart
from the practical benefit they derive from it; he described how they
will repeat the performance for its own sake, as a kind of play. W. N.
and L. A. Kellogg found that a young chimpanzee is just as much inclined
as a child of the same age to repeat in play a manipulation involving
the use of a tool which it had first invented for some practical
purpose. The animal was also as keen as the child to climb into the
place where it was usually confronted with the task of solving problems.
These intellectual tastes of the animal prefigure, no doubt, the joys of
discovery which our articulate powers can attain for man, but in the
animal they do not remotely approach these joys in scope and elevation.
As language enlarges the range of our thought, the ape’s pleasure in
playing with a stick is expanded to a complex system of emotional
responses by which scientific value and ingenuity of many kinds are
appreciated throughout natural science, technology and mathematics. This
is the kind of feeling described in the title of this chapter as
‘Intellectual Passions’. Before going into it further, let me notice the
new context into which science is shifted by attending to this aspect of
it. A scientific theory which calls attention to its own beauty, and
partly relies on it for claiming to represent empirical reality, is akin
to a work of art which calls attention to its own beauty as a token of
artistic reality. It is akin also to the mystical contemplation of
nature: a kinship shown historically in the Pythagorean origins of
theoretical science. More generally, science, by virtue of its
passionate note, finds its place among the great systems of utterances
which try to evoke and impose correct modes of feeling. In teaching its
own kinds of formal excellence science functions like art, religion,
morality, law and other constituents of culture.</p>
<p>This alignment greatly amplifies the perspective of our enquiry.
Though we had noticed before that science claims to appraise order and
probability and accredits scientific skill and connoisseurship, these
evaluative components of science were emotionally colourless compared
with the intellectual passions by which science appreciates its own
beauty. If the upholding of scientific truth requires that we justify
such passionate valuations, our task expands inevitably also to the
justification of those equally passionate valuations on which the
affirmation of the several domains of culture is predicated. Science can
then no longer hope to survive on an island of positive facts, around
which the rest of man’s intellectual heritage sinks to the status of
subjective emotionalism. It must claim that certain emotions are right;
and if it can make good such a claim, it will not only save itself but
sustain by its example the whole system of cultural life of which it
forms part.</p>
<p>Yet while accepting the inescapable solidarity of science with other
cultural provinces, I shall have to strike a compromise in this book
between the claims of this connection and the limitations of my space.
Though it may eventually prove easier to uphold a fuller truth on
broader grounds, I cannot attempt this task here in its entirety. I
propose, therefore, to continue my enquiry into the conditions for
upholding factual truth, while digressing only from time to time to
indicate the wider implications of this project.</p>
