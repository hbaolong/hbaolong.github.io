<h4 id="post-marxian-liberalism">16. POST-MARXIAN LIBERALISM</h4>
<p>No regime has carried out the implications of modern revolutionary
dynamism to its logical limits. In fact, it may seem quite impracticable
even to approach the complete subordination of all thought to the
service of one specific centre of power. The artificial universe encased
in the official Soviet jargon had always to be supplemented by natural
human sentiments expressed in normal language, and occasionally whole
masses of them have been re-introduced. This happened in the 1930’s when
the Kremlin decided to restore national sentiments and their traditional
heroes into Russian historic consciousness, abandoning thereby the
hitherto uncontested doctrine of M. N. Pokrovsky (1868–1932), who had
turned historiography into an abstract sociological analysis on Marxist
lines. On another occasion, when—in 1950—Stalin repudiated the absurd
doctrine of N. Y. Marr (1864–1934), according to which all language was
class-language, the dictator gave a vivid picture of how this orthodoxy
had hitherto trampled on Soviet linguistics—freely drawing for this
purpose on the vocabulary of liberalism, and aptly using its principles
for the condemnation of this case of totalitarian thought-control which
he had himself imposed until that moment.44 Despite all Lenin’s
admonitions that party-spirit is the only true objectivity, the concepts
of truth, and of the freedom of thought essential to the establishment
of truth, were by no means extinguished even in the period of the
strictest ideological dictatorship.</p>
<p>The gradual humanization of the Soviet regime that has occurred since
Stalin’s death may be due to the leaking out of the generous passions
buried alive under the Marxist armoury of violence. Indeed, by a kind of
inverted Freudian ab-reaction this captive zeal for righteousness may
yet be gradually released from its pathological repressions and enter
once more into the context of consciously declared moral
aspirations.</p>
<p>The first step in that direction was taken immediately after Stalin’s
death, when his successors released the thirteen Kremlin doctors who had
confessed to the assassination of Zsdanov. On the day in March, 1953,
when this took place, the systematic transmutation of Communist
dignitaries into self-confessed spies – publicly begging to be hanged
for their infamous crimes—was brought to an end. The new masters did not
trust altogether the universe of deception and self-deception erected by
Stalin, and tried to consolidate their rule by abandoning its worst
distortions of the truth; they hoped to gain in persuasive power what
they renounced in coercive force.</p>
<p>The liberation of thought that has since been going on and has
culminated so far in the Hungarian and Polish revolutions of October,
1956, has been called the Revolution of Truth. The designation is apt,
if the meaning of truth is taken to comprise the fruits of all
independent thought. For the rights of art, morality, religion and
patriotism were restored to some extent along with the right to the
knowledge of facts.</p>
<p>The Hungarian insurgents revived the slogans of 1848, and various
writers have declared that the movement re-asserted the belief in
absolute values as held in the eighteenth century. Others declared that
the liberal revolutions had to be fought all over again. But this
description is misleading. Compare Wazyk’s Poem for Adults, published in
August, 1955, with the Marseillaise, written by Rouget de Lisle in
April, 1792; compare Petofi’s flaming sentiments with the cold
incisiveness of a Jozsef Attila. The background of 1848 was the French
Revolution, which had challenged an immemorial static order by
proclaiming the right of society to perfect itself according to reason,
and the liberalism of the nineteenth century fought for this aim and
against that order. But when the appetitive conception of man denied the
reality of moral motives in public life, the ideals of liberalism were
inverted into the doctrines of modern totalitarianism. Liberalism had
then to light its way back to a position which had proved disastrously
unstable in the light of modern philosophies. This is why Wazyk speaks
of ‘vomiting’ the lies swallowed under Stalin’s rule; and why every
insurgent Communist speaks of a period during which he connived with
growing reluctance at a soul-destroying tyranny which he accepted as the
only authentic instrument of human progress.</p>
<p>Can a revulsion against the consequences of modern totalitarianism
restore a set of beliefs, on the logical weakness of which the doctrines
of totalitarianism itself were founded? Can the beliefs of liberalism,
no longer believed to be self-evident, be upheld henceforth in the form
of an orthodoxy? Can we face the fact that, no matter how liberal a free
society may be, it is also profoundly conservative?</p>
<p>For this is the fact. The recognition granted in a free society to
the independent growth of science, art and morality, involves a
dedication of society to the fostering of a specific tradition of
thought, transmitted and cultivated by a particular group of
authoritative specialists, perpetuating themselves by co-option. To
uphold the independence of thought implemented by such a society is to
subscribe to a kind of orthodoxy which, though it specifies no fixed
articles of faith, is virtually unassailable within the limits imposed
on the process of innovation by the cultural leadership of a free
society. If this is what Lenin meant by saying that The absence of party
spirit (partinost) in philosophy is nothing but despicable and disguised
servility towards idealism and fideism’,45 we cannot deny the charge.
And we must face also the fact that this orthodoxy, and the cultural
authorities which we respect, are backed by the coercive power of the
state and financed by the beneficiaries of office and property. The
institutions by which their authority is exercised, the schools,
universities, churches, academies, law courts, newspapers and political
parties, are under the protection of the same policemen and soldiers who
guard the wealth of the landowners and capitalists.</p>
<p>Must this institutional framework be accepted as the civic home of a
free society? Is it true that the absolute right of moral
self-determination, on which political liberty was founded, can be
upheld only by refraining from any radical action towards the
establishment of justice and brotherhood? That indeed, unless we agree
that within our lifetime we must no more than loosen the tics of a free
society, however iniquitous they may be, we shall inevitably precipitate
men into abject servitude?</p>
<p>For my part, I would say: Yes. I believe that, on the whole, these
limitations are imperative. Unjust privileges prevailing in a free
society can be reduced only by carefully graded stages; those who would
demolish them overnight would erect greater injustices in their place.
An absolute moral renewal of society can be attempted only by an
absolute power which must inevitably destroy the moral life of man.</p>
<p>This truth is unpalatable to our conscience. Does it follow that we
must suppress our conscience, or else accept the totalitarian teaching
that violence alone is honest? I said in the introduction to this
chapter that I would renew within a social setting the question, how we
can keep holding beliefs that can conceivably be doubted. The attempt
made in this book to stabilize knowledge against scepticism, by
including its hazardous character in the conditions of knowledge, may
find its equivalent, then, in an allegiance to a manifestly imperfect
society, based on the acknowledgment that our duty lies in the service
of ideals which we cannot possibly achieve.</p>
