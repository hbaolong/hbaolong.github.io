<h4 id="scepticism-within-the-natural-sciences">4. SCEPTICISM WITHIN THE
NATURAL SCIENCES</h4>
<p>In the natural sciences the proof of an allegation cannot be as
rigorous as it normally is in mathematics. We often refuse to accept an
alleged scientific proof largely because on general grounds we are
reluctant to believe what it tries to prove. It was the presumption of
Wöhler and Liebig against the idea that fermentation was due to living
cells which made them disregard the evidence in its favour. The kind of
evidence produced by van’t Hoff for the asymmetrical carbon atom was
condemned by Kolbe as worthless by the very nature of its argumentation.
Pasteur’s evidence for the absence of spontaneous generation was
rejected by his opponents by interpreting it in their own way, and even
Pasteur admitted that this possibility could not be excluded.10</p>
<p>Inexplicable things continue to happen in a laboratory. For example,
traces of helium or traces of gold may unaccountably turn up in sealed
vessels and the effect may be reproducible. At a time when the
artificial transmutation of elements first appeared vaguely possible, a
number of scientists accepted such observations as evidence that
transmutation had taken place. But once the true conditions for
transmutation had been elucidated, observations of this kind were no
longer heeded by scientists.11</p>
<p>In an earlier book I have mentioned a paper published by Lord
Rayleigh in June, 1947, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,
describing a simple experiment which demonstrated that a hydrogen atom
impinging on a metal wire released energies ranging up to a hundred
electron volts.12 This conclusion, if correct, would have been of
immense importance. Physicists whom I consulted could find no fault with
the experiment, yet they ignored its results, and did not even think it
worth while to repeat it. A possible explanation of it is suggested by a
recent experiment of R. H. Burgess and J. C. Robb.13 They have shown
that in the presence of traces of oxygen (0.22–0.94 mm.), hydrogen atoms
will cause a rise in temperature on a metal wire many times exceeding
the heat of recombination of H atoms on the wire. If this is the
explanation, physicists were well advised to ignore this work.</p>
<p>A scientist must commit himself in respect to any important claim put
forward within his field of knowledge. If he ignores the claim he does
in fact imply that he believes it to be unfounded. If he takes notice of
it, the time and attention which he diverts to its examination and the
extent to which he takes account of it in guiding his own investigations
are a measure of the likelihood he ascribes to its validity. Only if a
claim lies totally outside his range of responsible interests can the
scientist assume an attitude of completely impartial doubt towards it.
He can be strictly agnostic only on subjects of which he knows little
and cares nothing.</p>
