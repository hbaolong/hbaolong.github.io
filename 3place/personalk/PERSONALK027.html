<h4 id="introduction">1. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>GUA the chimpanzee was born in captivity on November 15th, 1930, in
Cuba. When she reached the age of seven months and a half she was
adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Kellogg of Bloomington, Indiana, to become a
companion to their baby Donald, who had just completed the fifth month
of his life.1 During the following nine months the two infants were
brought up in exactly the same way and their development was recorded by
identical tests. A graph comparing the number of successful intelligence
tests passed by them shows a striking parallelism in the development of
the two. It is true that the child, though the younger, soon took the
lead over the chimpanzee and retained this throughout, but the advantage
was slight compared with the child’s prospective intellectual
superiority which was presently to become apparent. At the age of 15 to
18 months the mental development of the chimpanzee is nearing
completion; that of the child is only about to start. By responding to
people who talk to it, the child soon begins to understand speech and to
speak itself. By this one single trick in which it surpasses the animal,
the child acquires the capacity for sustained thought and enters on the
whole cultural heritage of its ancestors.</p>
<p>The gap which separates the small feats of animal and infant
intelligence from the achievements of scientific thought is enormous.
Yet the towering superiority of man over the animals is due,
paradoxically, to an almost imperceptible advantage in his original,
inarticulate faculties.2 The situation can be summed up in three points.
(1) Man’s intellectual superiority is almost entirely due to the use of
language. But (2) man’s gift of speech cannot itself be due to the use
of language and must therefore be due to pre-linguistic advantages. Yet
(3) if linguistic clues are excluded, men are found to be only slightly
better at solving the kind of problems we set to animals. From which it
follows that the inarticulate faculties—the potentialities—by which man
surpasses the animals and which, by producing speech, account for the
entire intellectual superiority of man, are in themselves almost
imperceptible. Accordingly, we shall have to account for man’s
acquisition of language by acknowledging in him the same kind of
inarticulate powers as we observe already in animals.</p>
<p>The enormous increase of mental powers derived from the acquisition
of formal instruments of thought stands also in a peculiar contrast with
the facts collected in the first part of this book, which demonstrate
the pervasive participation of the knowing person in the act of knowing
by virtue of an art which is essentially inarticulate. The two
conflicting aspects of formalized intelligence may be reconciled by
assuming that articulation always remains incomplete; that our
articulate utterances can never altogether supersede but must continue
to rely on such mute acts of intelligence as we once had in common with
chimpanzees of our own age.</p>
<p>Admittedly the scientist’s art of knowing, which I have surveyed
previously, is on a higher level than the child’s or the animal’s and
can be acquired only in conjunction with a knowledge of science as a
formal discipline. Other intellectual skills of a high order are
acquired similarly in the course of a continued formal education; and
indeed our mute abilities keep growing in the very exercise of our
articulate powers. Our formal upbringing evokes in us an elaborate set
of emotional responses, operating within an articulate cultural
framework. By the strength of these affections we assimilate this
framework and uphold it as our culture; yet the comparison of the baby
and the chimpanzee will go a long way towards accounting for the vastly
superior intelligence of man.</p>
<p>Before turning to our principal task of tracing the relation between
articulate and inarticulate intelligence, we may use the present vantage
ground to set our course towards an ultimate aim of this enquiry which
comes into view at this point.3 If, as it would seem, the meaning of all
our utterances is determined to an important extent by a skilful act of
our own—the act of knowing—then the acceptance of any of our own
utterances as true involves our approval of our own skill. To affirm
anything implies, then, to this extent an appraisal of our own art of
knowing, and the establishment of truth becomes decisively dependent on
a set of personal criteria of our own which cannot be formally defined.
If everywhere it is the inarticulate which has the last word, unspoken
and yet decisive, then a corresponding abridgement of the status of
spoken truth itself is inevitable. The ideal of an impersonally detached
truth would have to be reinterpreted, to allow for the inherently
personal character of the act by which truth is declared. The hope of
achieving an acceptable balance of mind in this respect will guide the
subsequent enquiry throughout Parts Two and Three of this book.</p>
