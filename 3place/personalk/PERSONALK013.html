<h4 id="grading-of-confidence">7. GRADING OF CONFIDENCE</h4>
<p>I have argued that my confident utterance of a hypothesis H cannot be
expressed by the impersonal symbol P(H/E). Accordingly, my commitment to
an empirical inference H based on the evidence E would always have to be
asserted in the form H/E, where the assertion sign would embody the
degree of confidence I place in H on the grounds of E.</p>
<p>But we must not disregard the fact that an inference H may be reached
with a numerically ascertainable degree of confidence. We may test a
‘normal population’—i.e. an aggregate assumed to show purely random
variations of a certain measured quantity—by observing a certain number
of samples from it. We may evaluate the samples, for example, with a
view to establishing the spread, or standard deviation, (σ) of the
measured quantity within the population. We thus obtain a series of
upper limits for the value of σ, each of which is ascertained with a
different degree of probability. Starting from the truism that σ &lt; ∞
can be asserted with absolute certainty, we can see that our assertions
will gradually lose in confidence, as the asserted upper limit
decreases. A useful compromise might then be found by asserting an upper
limit which can be asserted with a reasonably high degree of confidence,
say with a probability of 95 percent.11</p>
<p>In this case all three elements of the symbol P(H/E) can be
substantiated. We have a specific evidence E on which we base the
inference H asserting a numerical upper limit for σ, and we assert
concurrently that the probability of this inference being right is 0.95.
It is legitimate to denote this probability then by P(H/E), which would
function as an incomplete symbol and have to be prefixed by the
assertion sign in order to convey a confident utterance of our own. We
would write P(H/E).</p>
<p>This notation, P(H/E), could be generalized further by applying it to
all processes of inference based on admittedly incomplete or even
erroneous evidence. We could then use H/E and P(H/E) for uttering two
different statements. The first alleges an inference H, based on E;
while the second credits someone with having carried out a process of
inference believed by him to be based on E. This distinction can be made
more definite only later, within a framework which reconciles the
universal intent of our own assertions with the divergences between
equally strong convictions of different people, or of the same people at
different times.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this chapter bear a resemblance to the dual theory
of probability, advocated for example by Carnap.12 But its relation to
these antecedents is rather complex, for it acknowledges a greater
variety of elements and also a certain number of combinations between
them. Whether a statement is unambiguous (pu) or statistical (ps), it
can be uttered with different grades of confidence. These modalities are
expressed by prefixing the assertion sign, so as to write: pu or ps.
This sign brings in the second kind of probability, which may be further
specifiable numerically, as in the case of judging a population from a
sample. This situation can be represented by the symbol P(H/E), which
must then be completed to read P(H/E). Alternatively, we may designate
in the same terms a belief H—whether unambiguous or statistical—that is,
or was, held on some specific evidence E by another person, or by
ourselves at another time. Such a belief may again be considered then
with varying grades of approval, and this establishes the bearing of the
symbol P(H/E) on the whole range of beliefs, all the way from what are
approved as rational beliefs to beliefs as compulsive conditions
observed psychologically.13</p>
