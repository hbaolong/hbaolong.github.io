<h4 id="marxist-leninist-epistemology">14. MARXIST-LENINIST
EPISTEMOLOGY</h4>
<p>Since the rise of Greek philosophy in the fifth century B. C., men
have been considering the possibility of systematically doubting what
they believed in. Marxism is a relatively stable structure in which
moral aspirations can be saved from self-doubt at the price of fixing
them to the pursuit of a certain set of material ends. But a similar
fixation seems to operate less successfully for artistic passions. While
the people of the Soviet Union under Stalin did not lack a sense of
moral purpose, they were bored with the official artistic products. And
the attempt to identify the search for truth with the advancement of
Soviet Communism has met with even greater difficulties. This had many
reasons.</p>
<p>In spite of Hume’s scepticism and its antecedents, going back to
ancient Pyrrhonism, there was no self-doubt among scientists in the
modern free societies of the twentieth century. On the contrary, belief
in science stood supreme as the only belief that remained practically
unchallenged. Indeed, according to the positivist view widely
disseminated since Comte, all human thought was seen engaged in a humble
pilgrimage towards scientific perfection, and to Marx and Engels natural
science was the archetype of objective truth: to them science was
definitely not an ideology to be unmasked now, and to be later
identified with the victory of Socialism. But once the fundamental
dynamo-objective coupling is firmly established for moral passions, it
inevitably tends to become extended to science on the same lines as to
artistic pursuits. The neo-Marxian theory of science first rose to
importance around 1930 and became within the subsequent decade the
official doctrine of the U.S.S.R. under Stalin. At first it was limited
to re-interpreting the history of science, showing that each step in its
progress occurred in response to practical needs. To claim independent
status for pure science was ridiculed as mere snobbery.38 Then, from the
unmasking of science as being really technology, there followed the
glorification of technology as being really science. And since
technology achieves material welfare, it was accepted as part of
progress and of Socialism itself; so that the pursuit of science became
at last embodied in the advancement of Socialism.</p>
<p>So far this was harmless nonsense. But soon unmasking became more
virulent. It began with scattered sniping at the more modern
developments of ‘bourgeois science’, in relativity, quantum mechanics,
astronomy, psychology, and it culminated in the campaign against
Mendelism. The new position was finally established when in August, 1948
Lysenko triumphantly announced to the Academy of Science that his
biological views had been approved by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party and members rose as one man to acclaim this
decision.</p>
<p>The universality of science was now definitely repudiated. The claims
of bourgeois science to universal validity were unmasked as deceptive
ideology, while Soviet Science was directed to rely frankly on its
partisan or class character. Owing to the dual mechanism of Marxism, the
doctrine that all science is class science served simultaneously both to
discredit bourgeois science and to accredit socialist science. Moreover,
in serving the Party, science recovers—in a new sense—a claim to
universality: the universality of truth is replaced by the inherently
righteous and therefore historically inevitable victory of a future
Communist world-government.</p>
<p>The dual meanings of ‘objectivity’ and ‘partisanship’ in this method
of accrediting Soviet science are self-consistent. The claims of
bourgeois science to objectivity and universal validity are unmasked as
false pretences on the grounds that no affirmation of science, history,
or philosophy can be objective and that in reality they are always
partisan weapons. At the same time, Marxism claims to have made politics
into a science that bases every political action on a strictly objective
assessment of the social conditions in which it has to operate, and the
unmasking of bourgeois objectivity as partisan is itself an example of
this Marxist objectivity. But such objectivity does not claim
universality, for it would contradict itself if it claimed—for
example—that the bourgeoisie could be persuaded to accept it as
objective. Marxism claims for itself therefore to be objective only in
the sense of being a weapon of proletarian partisanship. Neither
‘objectivity’ nor ‘partisanship’ is either right or wrong, it is only
Socialism that is right (i.e. rising) and Capitalism that is wrong
(i.e. decaying). The demand made by Stalin’s regime on Soviet scholars
to eschew objectivity (in the sense of universal validity) and to be
guided instead by Socialist partisanship, is therefore quite consistent
with the Marxist’s own claims to objectivity.39</p>
<p>The strict application of this theory of knowledge would suppress
natural science, with the exception of the narrow area in which pure
science overlaps with technology. I have spoken of this outcome of the
Laplacean programme in more general terms before. We can see now that
the radical utilitarianism resulting from an objectivist view of man
does not produce this result by itself. For its logic often remains
mercifully suspended. Only when great moral aspirations, aiming at the
radical transformation of society, are injected into the mechanistic
idea of man, are engines of power engendered which press for the
fulfilment of this logic. Even so, the attempt may remain abortive: the
intellectual passions of scientists may rebel successfully, and reduce
the effects of totalitarianism over scientific thought to a verbal
disguise of its proper standards. In fact,—even in biology—a brief
incantation of Marxist phrases has usually sufficed to secure immunity
from Marxist doctrine for the substance of a scientific paper in Soviet
Russia.</p>
