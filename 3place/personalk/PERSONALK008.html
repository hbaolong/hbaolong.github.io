<h4 id="unambiguous-statements">2. UNAMBIGUOUS STATEMENTS</h4>
<p>The avowed purpose of the exact sciences is to establish complete
intellectual control over experience in terms of precise rules which can
be formally set out and empirically tested. Could that ideal be fully
achieved, all truth and all error could henceforth be ascribed to an
exact theory of the universe, while we who accept this theory would be
relieved of any occasion for exercising our personal judgment: we should
only have to follow the rules faithfully. Classical mechanics approaches
this ideal so closely that it is often thought to have achieved it. But
this leaves out of account the element of personal judgment involved in
applying the formulae of mechanics to the facts of experience. Take for
example a single planet circling round the sun. Newtonian mechanics
supplies us with an exact formula by the aid of which we can compute the
configuration of this two-body system for the most distant future or for
the remotest past, provided only that we are given one single set of
data, describing the system at one single moment of time. Supposing we
observed the motion of the planet from the earth, it would suffice to
know its longitude (l0) and elevation (e0) at a time (t0), in order to
compute any pair of longitudes (l) and elevation (e) for any other time
(t). Such an operation would be quite impersonal and could indeed be
done by a machine, automatically, so that it does look as if it
predicted certain facts of experience from other anterior facts of
experience quite impersonally. But this would overlook the fact that the
numbers giving longitudes, elevations, and times which enter into the
formulae of celestial mechanics are not facts of experience. The facts
are readings on the instruments of a particular observatory: readings
from which we derive the data on which we base our computation and by
which we check the results of such computations. The derivation of data
and checking of data that bridge the gap between our instrument readings
and the magnitudes figuring in our formulae can never be fully
automatic. For any correlation between a measured number introduced into
an exact theory and the corresponding instrument readings, rests on an
estimate of observational errors which cannot be definitively prescribed
by rule. This indeterminacy is due in the first place to the statistical
fluctuations of observational errors, to which I shall yet return. In
consequence of such random errors we can only proceed from the probable
values of initial data to probable values of predicted magnitudes, and
since no strict relationship exists between these two sets of figures,
the process remains to this extent indeterminate. Apart from these
fluctuations we have always the possibility of systematic errors. Even
the most strictly mechanized procedure leaves something to personal
skill in the exercise of which an individual bias may enter.</p>
<p>We should remember always the famous case of the Astronomer Royal,
Nicholas Maskeleyne, who dismissed his assistant Kinnebrook for
persistently recording the passage of stars more than half a second
later than he, his superior.1 Maskelyne did not realize that an equally
watchful observer may register systematically different times by the
method employed by him; it was only Bessel’s realization of this
possibility which 20 years later resolved the discrepancy and belatedly
justified Kinnebrook. Experimental psychology, of which Bessel thus laid
the foundation, has since taught us universally to expect such
individual variations in perceptive faculties. We must always assume,
therefore, that some trace of a hidden personal bias may systematically
affect the result of a series of readings.2</p>
<p>Such residual indeterminacies, governed by no definite rules, can
usually be disposed of according to routine practice. Yet even so, this
process always sets aside conceivable doubts regarding the application
of any definite set of rules, and without this no scientific work could
ever be accomplished and no scientific statement could be asserted. We
have here an essential personal participation of the scientist even in
the most exact operations of science.</p>
<p>There is an even wider area of personal judgment in every
verification of a scientific theory. Contrary to current opinion, it is
not the case that a proven discrepancy between theoretical predictions
and observed data suffices in itself to invalidate a theory. Such
discrepancies may often be classed as anomalies. The perturbations of
the planetary motions that were observed during 60 years preceding the
discovery of Neptune, and which could not be explained by the mutual
interaction of the planets, were rightly set aside at the time as
anomalies by most astronomers, in the hope that something might
eventually turn up to account for them without impairing—or at least not
essentially impairing—Newtonian gravitation. Speaking more generally, we
may say that there are always some conceivable scruples which scientists
customarily set aside in the process of verifying an exact theory. Such
acts of personal judgment form an essential part of science.3</p>
