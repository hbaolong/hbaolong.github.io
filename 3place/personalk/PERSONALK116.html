<h4 id="at-the-point-of-confluence">10. AT THE POINT OF CONFLUENCE</h4>
<p>This completes the extrapolation of biology to the point where it
coincides with our commitment to the intellectual standards of our
culture. Looking back from this point of confluence on the two branches
of the argument which it unites, we can see that each can be generalized
to include the other, and that this brings out their joint ontological
significance.</p>
<p>The enquiry into the nature and justification of personal knowledge,
which fills Parts One, Two and Three of this book, has led to the
acceptance of our calling—for which we are not responsible—as a
condition for the exercise of a responsible judgment with universal
intent. Our calling was seen to be determined by our innate faculties
and our early upbringing within our own culture, and these conditions
were made to subserve an act of commitment by relying on them for the
fulfilment of standards believed to be universal. Calling; personal
judgment involving responsibility; self-compulsion and independence of
conscience; universal standards; all these were shown to exist only in
their relation to each other within a commitment. They dissolve if
looked upon non-committally. We may call this the ontology of
commitment.</p>
<p>This ontology can be expanded by acknowledging the achievements of
other living beings. This is biology. It is a participation of the
biologist in various levels of commitment of other organisms, usually
lower than himself. At these levels he acknowledges trueness to type,
equipotentiality, operational principles, drives, perception and animal
intelligence, according to standards accepted by him for the organisms
in question. I have demonstrated that these achievements are personal
facts which are dissolved by any attempt to specify them in impersonal
(or not sufficiently personal) terms. The unspecifiability of such
achievements can now be seen to represent a generalization of the
theorem that the elements of a commitment cannot be defined in
non-committal terms. The paradox of self-set standards and the solution
of this paradox are thus generalized to include the standards which we
set ourselves in appraising other organisms and attribute to them as
proper to them. We may say that this generalization of the universal
pole of commitment acknowledges the whole range of being which we
attribute to organisms at ascending levels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the extrapolation of biology to the acknowledgment
of human greatness, by which we first reached the point of ‘confluence’,
shows how a reverse generalization could be carried out, by which
biology would come to include the whole ontology of commitment. For
human greatness can be recognized only by submission to it and thus
belongs to the family of things which exist only for those committed to
them. All manner of excellence that we accept for our guidance, and all
obligations to which we grant jurisdiction over us, can be defined by
our respect for human greatness. And from these objects of our respect
we can pass on continuously to purely cognitive targets, such as facts,
knowledge, proof, reality, science—all of which can likewise be said to
exist only as binding on ourselves. We can then work our way back from
this point, by aid of reflection, to a recognition of ourselves as the
persons deliberately entering on these commitments and can extend our
recognition also to all the members of a society sharing similar beliefs
and obligations. The whole ontology of commitment and of a free society
dedicated to the cultivation of thought by responsible commitments of
its members can in fact be built up, in this manner, as a generalization
of biology followed by reflection on this generalized biology.</p>
<p>Thus, at the confluence of biology and philosophical
self-accrediting, man stands rooted in his calling under a firmament of
truth and greatness. Its teachings are the idiom of his thought: the
voice by which he commands himself to satisfy his intellectual
standards. Its commands harness his powers to the exercise of his
responsibilities. It binds him to abiding purposes, and grants him power
and freedom to defend them.</p>
<p>And we can establish it now as a matter of logic that man has no
other power than this.</p>
<p>He is strong, noble and wonderful so long as he fears the voices of
this firmament; but he dissolves their power over himself and his own
powers gained through obeying them, if he turns back and examines what
he respects in a detached manner. Then law is no more than what the
courts will decide, art but an emollient of nerves, morality but a
convention, tradition but an inertia, God but a psychological necessity.
Then man dominates a world in which he himself does not exist. For with
his obligations he has lost his voice and his hope, and been left behind
meaningless to himself.</p>
