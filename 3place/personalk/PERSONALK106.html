<h4 id="logical-levels">7. LOGICAL LEVELS</h4>
<p>To the extent to which our personal participation in knowing a fact
contributes to making it what it is, we may call it a personal fact. To
the extent to which our personal knowing of a thing is unspecifiable,
the thing itself cannot be represented exhaustively in terms of its less
personal particulars. This is true in respect of inanimate things like a
piece of information, an accident, a noise or a pattern, and was
implied, and sometimes also expressly stated, in my discussion of these
personal facts in Part One. I have also spoken of this aspect of
personal knowledge at some length in the present chapter, with reference
to machines. But its major importance emerges only when we turn to
living beings, where an important additional feature is added to it:
this feature is our recognition of individuals.</p>
<p>There is life in tissue cultures and viruses which are not segregated
in the form of individuals, and the germ plasm transmitting heredity has
a continuously extended life, which transcends the individuals through
which it passes. Fragments of plants and lower animals may be viable in
themselves. Yet the bulk of living matter is found embodied in a finite
set of individuals, circumscribed in space and of limited duration in
time. Each has come into existence at a definite moment, to remain alive
for a certain period, after which it will die.</p>
<p>Our acknowledgment of an individual is an act of personal knowing
which is clearly foreshadowed, as follows, in the claim I have made to
hold my personal knowledge responsibly, with universal intent. (1) I am
myself an individual living being. Therefore as I gave instances of my
personal knowledge and analysed my essential participation in it, I was
already describing a living being, and crediting it with certain arts of
doing and knowing of which I believe myself possessed. (2) Having such
confidence in myself, I went on to recognize the companionship of other
people, thus using my powers of personal knowing for crediting others
with the exercise of similar powers.21 (3) By the same token I can now
generalize this fiduciary act to a recognition of all kinds of
individual living beings.</p>
<p>Individuality is, accordingly, a personal fact, and to that extent
unspecifiable. To this I shall return in the next chapter; for the time
being, I shall deal with other peculiarities of our knowledge concerning
individuals. In the first place, a living individual strikes us as a
personal fact, having a much more tangible and active being than any
other personal fact that we have yet encountered. Of course, every
comprehension of a whole acknowledges the reality of it; and whatever we
comprehend both means something to us and to a certain extent at least
means something also existentially, in itself. We experience this
meaning by pouring ourselves out for the sake of achieving a focal
awareness of the whole. By dwelling in a harmonious sequence of sounds,
we acknowledge their joint meaning as a tune: a meaning they have in
themselves, existentially. Up to a point our acknowledgment of the
existence of a living individual proceeds on quite similar lines. We
appraise in it a significant orderliness, which as such means something
in itself. But a living individual is altogether different from any of
the inanimate things, like tunes, words, poems, theories, cultures, to
which we have ascribed meaning before this. Its meaning is different,
perhaps richer, and above all, it has a centre. The focus of our
comprehension is now something active, that grows, produces meaningful
shapes, survives by the rational functioning of its organs; something
that can behave and acquire knowledge, and at a human level, can even
think and affirm its own convictions.</p>
<p>The acknowledgment of such a centre is a logical novelty. This
becomes strikingly apparent at the human level. When we know somebody
who himself knows something, his knowledge is part of our subject
matter. We must decide whether it is in fact knowledge. A man’s
illusions are not the same as his knowledge. We must undertake therefore
to discriminate between the two and to understand the ground on which
knowledge was acquired. So presently we find ourselves examining
knowledge or alleged knowledge, in the same way as when we reflect on
what we ourselves know, or believe we know.</p>
<p>This is very peculiar. For logicians discriminate sharply between our
knowledge of things and our reflections on our knowledge of things.
Natural science is regarded as a knowledge of things, while knowledge
about science is held to be quite distinct from science, and is called
‘meta-science’. We have then three logical levels: a first floor for the
objects of science, a second for science itself and a third for
meta-science, which includes the logic and epistemology of science. But
since we have seen that sign-learning is logically equivalent to the
establishment of truth in the natural sciences, it follows that the
process of sign-learning takes place on two logical levels: learning
occupying the higher, and the discrimination box, etc., the lower level.
And hence to the study of sign-learning we now ascribe the three-storied
structure of a meta-science, the animal psychologist occupying its
topmost, third level. I have anticipated this already up to a point on
p. 262 by defining the tripartite situation in which the neurologist
investigates the functions of the brain.</p>
<p>A science dealing with living persons appears now logically different
from a science dealing with inanimate things. In contrast to the
two-storied logical structure of inanimate science, biological science,
or at least some parts of biology, seem to possess a three-storied
structure, similar to that of logic and epistemology. This conclusion
presents us with the following paradox. The evolutionary process forms a
continuous transition from the inanimate stage to that of living and
knowing persons; how can it then bring forth an additional logical
level—two in place of one, three in place of two?</p>
<p>Let us look first at the stage where the three-storied structure is
fully established. Once we have before us the deliberate behaviour of an
animal, by which it commits itself to a mode of action which can be
right or wrong, and which thus implies assumptions about external things
that can be true or false, the understanding of such a commitment is a
theory of rightness and knowledge. It is clearly three-storied. But some
aspects of the three-storied structure emerge much earlier, at the very
first appearance of individual living beings. Any such individual may be
said to be normal or abnormal; healthy or sick; it may be mutilated,
malformed, or else intact and well-shaped. The three-storied structure
manifests itself at this stage only in the fact that any distinction
between a physiological and pathological shape or process must
necessarily be based on standards of rightness that are proper to the
individual in question. These standards, which are common to the species
to which the individual belongs, acknowledge our interest in the
existence of normal specimens of the species and endorse their normal
functions as proper to them. The observer’s judgment of rightness
already operates here on two consecutive levels. On the upper level, it
establishes the physiological characteristics of the species, as opposed
to its pathological anomalies, while, on the lower level, it applies
these criteria for the appraisal of a single individual, on the
assumption that they tell us what is good for him. The most primitive
stage at which a third, lowest level becomes apparent, is when animals
operate externally, though without deliberation, e.g. by co-ordinating
their limbs for locomotion, guiding their migration, etc. The animal may
then be said to be doing something that can be right or wrong, though in
a weaker sense than when it is acting deliberately. Where no action is
involved no lower level exists, and the judgments of morphology and
physiology then merely imply that the normal existence of the animal is
right in being what it is, as it is.</p>
<p>Biology is therefore three-storied in so far as the individual under
observation is doing or knowing something, and two-storied when it
observes an individual existing by himself, without bearing on things
outside it. This reduction in the number of logical levels is similar to
the transition from technology and the natural sciences, which both
operate on two levels, to pure mathematics and music which—having no
bearing on things outside themselves—are experienced by indwelling, on
one level. Life lived for itself is equated here logically with artistic
experience. Since passive existence awakens gradually to active
performances, there is no discontinuity in the transition from the
two-storied biology of plants and the lowest animals, to the
three-storied biology of the more active and more knowledgeable animals.
This resolves our paradox.</p>
<p>The appraisal of an animal’s behaviour (as well as of its shape and
the functioning of its organs) on two consecutive levels is an important
generalization of a principle that we have met before, when we
acknowledged the greatness of a scientific work of the past, even when
its results had been largely mistaken. We did so because we judged the
merits of the work within the framework of the means available to the
author at the time. It was the same principle, once more, which defined
our own calling in the light of the particular conditions to which we
were born and brought up. All the applications of this principle were
made with universal intent, by distinguishing between the subjective or
contingent in us, which is part of our calling, and the personal in us
which acts within this setting.</p>
<p>This brings me to a second logical novelty arising from the
acknowledgment of a centre of individuality. For it shows another way in
which logical levels can be effaced, this time particularly on the human
level. Another person can judge us as we can judge him, and his judgment
may affect our judgment of ourselves. Our relation to him may, indeed,
be predominantly passive, as when we acknowledge the person’s authority.
For to the extent to which we accept a statement on trust, we forgo
enquiring into its justification and cannot be said to be examining it
from our own superior logical level. A measure of companionship prevails
even between the animal psychologist and a rat on which he is
experimenting, but interpersonal relations become ampler as we deal with
higher animals, and even more as we reach the inter-human level.
Mutuality prevails to such an extent here that the logical category of
an observer facing an object placed on a lower logical level becomes
altogether inapplicable. The I-It situation has been gradually
transformed into an I-Thou relation. This suggests the possibility of a
continuous transition from statements of fact to affirmations of moral
and civic commands. We shall see this confirmed at the close of the next
chapter.</p>
