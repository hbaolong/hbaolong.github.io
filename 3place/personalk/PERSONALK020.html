<h4 id="tradition">3. TRADITION</h4>
<p>An art which cannot be specified in detail cannot be transmitted by
prescription, since no prescription for it exists. It can be passed on
only by example from master to apprentice. This restricts the range of
diffusion to that of personal contacts, and we find accordingly that
craftsmanship tends to survive in closely circumscribed local
traditions. Indeed, the diffusion of crafts from one country to another
can often be traced to the migration of groups of craftsmen, as that of
the Huguenots driven from France by the repeal of the Edict of Nantes
under Louis XIV. Again, while the articulate contents of science are
successfully taught all over the world in hundreds of new universities,
the unspecifiable art of scientific research has not yet penetrated to
many of these. The regions of Europe in which the scientific method
first originated 400 years ago are scientifically still more fruitful
today, in spite of their impoverishment, than several overseas areas
where much more money is available for scientific research. Without the
opportunity offered to young scientists to serve an apprenticeship in
Europe, and without the migration of European scientists to the new
countries, research centres overseas could hardly ever have made much
headway.</p>
<p>It follows that an art which has fallen into disuse for the period of
a generation is altogether lost. There are hundreds of examples of this
to which the process of mechanization is continuously adding new ones.
These losses are usually irretrievable. It is pathetic to watch the
endless efforts—equipped with microscopy and chemistry, with mathematics
and electronics—to reproduce a single violin of the kind the
half-literate Stradi-varius turned out as a matter of routine more than
200 years ago.</p>
<p>To learn by example is to submit to authority. You follow your master
because you trust his manner of doing things even when you cannot
analyse and account in detail for its effectiveness. By watching the
master and emulating his efforts in the presence of his example, the
apprentice unconsciously picks up the rules of the art, including those
which are not explicitly known to the master himself. These hidden rules
can be assimilated only by a person who surrenders himself to that
extent uncritically to the imitation of another. A society which wants
to preserve a fund of personal knowledge must submit to tradition.</p>
<p>In effect, to the extent to which our intelligence falls short of the
ideal of precise formalization, we act and see by the light of
unspecifiable knowledge and must acknowledge that we accept the verdict
of our personal appraisal, be it at first hand by relying on our own
judgment, or at second hand by submitting to the authority of a personal
example as carrier of a tradition.</p>
<p>The subject of traditionalism cannot be pursued at length here; but
some peculiarities of traditional procedure are of immediate interest
for the understanding of personal knowledge. They are to be found in the
practice of the Common Law, which is the most important system of
strictly reasoned traditional activities. Common Law is founded on
precedent. In deciding a case today the Courts will follow the example
of other courts which have decided similar cases in the past, for in
these actions they see embodied the rules of the law. This procedure
recognizes the principle of all traditionalism that practical wisdom is
more truly embodied in action than expressed in rules of action.
Accordingly, the Common Law allows for the possibility that a judge may
interpret his own action mistakenly. The judicial maxim which sometimes
goes by the name of the ‘doctrine of the dictum’ lays it down that a
precedent is constituted by the decision of a court, irrespective of its
interpretation implied in any obiter dicta of the judge who made the
decision. The judge’s action is considered more authentic than what he
said he was doing.6</p>
<p>In the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries British
public life developed a political art and a political doctrine. The art
which embodied the exercise of public liberties was naturally
unspecifiable, the doctrines of political liberty were maxims of this
art which could be properly understood only by those skilled in the art.
But the doctrines of political freedom spread from England in the
eighteenth century to France and thence throughout the world, while the
unspecifiable art of exercising public liberty, being communicable only
by tradition, was not transmitted with it. When the French
Revolutionaries acted on this doctrine, which was meaningless without a
knowledge of its application in practice, Burke opposed them by a
traditionalist conception of a free society.</p>
