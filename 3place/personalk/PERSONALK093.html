<h4 id="the-coherence-of-commitment">3. THE COHERENCE OF COMMITMENT</h4>
<p>Epistemology has traditionally aimed at defining truth and falsity in
impersonal terms, for these alone are accepted as truly universal. The
framework of commitment leaves no scope for such an endeavour; for its
acceptance necessarily invalidates any impersonal justification of
knowledge. This can be illustrated by writing down a symbolic
representation of the elements joined together within a commitment and
contrasting these with the same elements, when looked upon
non-committally from outside the commitment situation. We may, for
example, represent a factual statement</p>
<p>The arrows in the first row indicate the force of commitment and the
brackets the coherence of the elements involved in the commitment;
accordingly, in the second row both these sets of symbols are
omitted.</p>
<p>The fiduciary passions which induce a confident utterance about the
facts are personal, because they submit to the facts as universally
valid, but when we reflect on this act non-committally its passion is
reduced to subjectivity. At the same time the confident utterance is
reduced to a sentence of unspecified modality, and the facts become
merely alleged facts. These elements, set out in the second row, are
mere fragments of the commitment that we had previously accredited by
the symbols in the first row.</p>
<p>Any particular commitment may be reconsidered, and this movement of
doubt would be expressed by passing from the first row to the second;
after which, having satisfied his doubts, the reflecting person would
recommit himself and move back into the situation represented by the
first row. But he would find this return blocked if, having realized
that this movement involves an act of his own judgment, he denied
justification to it by reason of its personal character.</p>
<p>In such a case, the reflecting person remains faced with the
fragments of his previous commitment, which as such no longer require
each other: for a subjective belief cannot be accounted for by
unaccredited facts, and a declaration expressing such a belief can no
longer be said to correspond to the facts. If he still continues to feel
that there is some consistent relation between his beliefs and the
factual evidence presented to him, he will regard this (with Hume) as a
mere habit, without acknowledging any justification of the convictions
expressed by this habit.</p>
<p>The reflecting person is then caught in an insoluble conflict between
a demand for an impersonality which would discredit all commitment and
an urge to make up his mind which drives him to recommit himself. Hume
has described most candidly the ensuing oscillation between a scepticism
which admittedly lacks conviction, and a conviction which dare not
consciously acknowledge its own acts and can be upheld only by
neglecting the result of philosophic reflection. I shall call this the
objectivist dilemma.</p>
<p>This dilemma has long haunted philosophy in the guise of the
‘correspondence theory of truth’. Bertrand Russell, for example, defines
truth as a coincidence between one’s subjective belief and the actual
facts;2 yet it is impossible, in terms which Russell would allow, to say
how the two could ever coincide.</p>
<p>The answer is this. The ‘actual facts’ are accredited facts, as seen
within the commitment situation, while subjective beliefs are the
convictions accrediting these facts as seen non-committally, by someone
not sharing them. But if we regard the beliefs in question
non-committally, as a mere state of mind, we cannot speak confidently,
without self-contradiction, of the facts to which these beliefs refer.
For it is self-contradictory to secede from the commitment situation as
regards the beliefs held within it, but to remain committed to the same
beliefs in acknowledging their factual content as true. It is nonsense
to imply that we simultaneously both hold and do not hold the same
belief, and to define truth as the coincidence between our actual belief
(as implied in our confident reference to the facts) and our denial of
the same belief (as implied in our reference to it as a mere state of
our mind concerning these facts).</p>
<p>I have mentioned before (Part Three, ch. 8) the futile regress and
the logical self-contradiction in which we become involved when casting
the reaffirmation of a factual statement into the form of another
factual statement, and have argued that we should avoid these anomalies
by denying that the utterance ‘p is true’ is a sentence. We now see how
the theory of knowledge is also thrown into confusion by the same
objectivistic language habit. This habit transforms an assertion coupled
to an asserted sentence into two asserted sentences: one about primary
objects, the other about the truth of a sentence mentioning these
objects. And this in its turn lands us with the problem of how we can be
said to know this truth as if it existed by itself (like snow), outside
us, though it is not something (like snow) that we can observe
impersonally, but an expression recording our own judgment. The muddle
can be avoided, once more, only by denying that ‘p is true’ is a
sentence, and acknowledging accordingly that it stands for an a-critical
act of acceptance which is not something one can either assert or know.
The word ‘true’ does not designate, then, a quality possessed by the
sentence p, but merely serves to make the phrase ‘p is true’ convey that
the person uttering it still believes p.</p>
<p>Admittedly, to say ‘p is true’, instead of ‘I believe p’ is to shift
the emphasis within one’s commitment from the personal to the external
pole. The utterance ‘I believe p’ expresses more aptly a heuristic
conviction or a religious belief, while ‘p is true’ will be preferred
for affirming a statement taken from a textbook of science. But a
greater fiduciary contribution does not necessarily correspond here to a
greater uncertainty of that which is affirmed. The emphasis on the
personal coefficient depends on the heuristic or persuasive passion that
it conveys. These passions may vary over all possible intensities,
whether the statement affirmed by them is unambiguous or statistical,
and whether the latter affirms a high or a low degree of probability.
The fiduciary component must always be thought of as included in a
prefixed affirmation sign, and never in the explicit statement
itself.</p>
<p>The assumption that the truth we seek to discover exists by itself,
hidden to us only by our misguided approach to it, represents correctly
the feeling of an investigator pursuing a discovery which keeps eluding
him. It may also express the ineradicable tension between our conviction
that we know something and the realization that we may conceivably be
mistaken. But in neither case can an outside observer of this relation
compare another person’s knowledge of the truth with the truth itself.
He can only compare the observed person’s knowledge of the truth with
his own knowledge of it.</p>
<p>According to the logic of commitment, truth is something that can be
thought of only by believing it. It is then improper to speak of another
person’s mental operation as leading to a true proposition in any other
sense than that it leads him to something the speaker himself believes
to be true. Let me illustrate the illegitimate use of the supposition
that something is true in itself by an argument of R. B. Braithwaite
concerning induction.3 He argues that if the policy of induction is
true, a person B who believes it to be true would reasonably arrive, by
the inductive method, at the conclusion that it is true. Three
propositions are said to be involved as follows: p, the assertion of the
evidence for the inductive hypothesis, i.e. the successful past
applications of induction; r, the assertion of the effectiveness of the
‘inferential policy’ leading from p to the assertion of the inductive
hypothesis; and q the inductive hypothesis itself. Now, Braithwaite
argues, if B reasonably believes p, and either believes (but not
reasonably) r, or if r is true (though B does not believe it), or if B
both (non-reasonably) believes r and r is true, then B may validly and
without circularity infer from these premisses a reasonable belief in q.
Thus (1) if B reasonably believes p, and subjectively believes r, his
consequent reasonable belief in q establishes the ‘subjective validity’
of the inductive hypothesis. Or (2) if B reasonably believes p and r is
true (whether he believes it or not), this establishes, Braithwaite
argues, the ‘objective validity’ of the inductive hypothesis.</p>
<p>What is demonstrated here is that if we believe in the method of
induction, q, we also believe that the past applications of this
method,p, offer public evidence of its effectiveness, r, when examined
in the very light of this method. This shows that belief in the method
of induction is both self-consistent and implies a belief in its own
self-consistency; but it shows nothing about the truth of this belief.
If we do not believe in the method of induction nothing follows at alt.
The illusion that some progress has been achieved towards the
establishment of q as true is due once again to the illegitimate
dismemberment of a commitment. ‘B believes r’ is shown to issue in a
‘subjective validity’ of q, and ‘r is true’ is used to establish q as
objectively valid. In the first case the conclusion is empty, unless the
writer by his own commitment to q transforms ‘subjective validity’ into
possession of the truth by B. In the second case V is true’ is used as a
presupposition for deriving q, though it cannot be asserted by the
author unless he has first endorsed q. In both cases the author’s
anterior commitment to q reduces the process of inference which he
attributes to B into a mere illustration of his own commitment.</p>
<p>We see it confirmed that we cannot compare subjective knowledge (in
B)with objective knowledge, except in the sense of judging B’s beliefs
from the point of view of our own beliefs. The only proper comparison
between imperfect knowledge and perfect knowledge remains the sense of
risk and intimation of achievement in a heuristic endeavour towards
knowledge, within a commitment situation.</p>
