<h4 id="elegance-and-beauty">4. ELEGANCE AND BEAUTY</h4>
<p>But I have yet to deal with a serious objection which will prove a
Demosthenic pebble, as its conquest will finally release the major force
of my argument. The mathematical theories of physics are formal systems
which are applied to experience by symbolic operations. Great
discoveries can be made in this manner, as when Adams and Leverrier
computed the position of Neptune from Newtonian mechanics, or van’t Hoff
derived the laws of chemical equilibrium from the Second Law of
Thermodynamics. Such operations, however, can be greatly facilitated by
re-casting a formal system into more manageable terms. This adds to the
beauty and power of the system without enlarging its theoretical scope;
it can tell more fluently what it says about nature, but cannot say more
than it could say before. So we can achieve greater economy and
simplicity in our interpretative framework, and keenly enjoy this as the
display of intellectual elegance, without saying anything substantially
new.</p>
<p>This admission seems to imperil our claim that the intellectual
beauty of a theory is a token of its contact with reality. Could it not
be true then after all—as Mach taught—that the advantage of any theory
is merely to give an economical account of observed facts?</p>
<p>This question was actually raised and fiercely discussed already by
the contemporaries of Copernicus, in respect to the Copernican system,
which I have used at the opening of this book to exemplify intellectual
beauty as a token of reality. Some years before the publication of his
theory, a Lutheran Minister in Nüremberg, called Andreas Osiander, had
urged on Copernicus that his system was merely a formal advance on
Ptolemy, and Osiander actually succeeded—we do not know quite by what
means—in getting this view stated in an Address to the Reader at the
opening of Copernicus’s book. Nor, since Copernicus was dying when his
work appeared in print (1543), do we know what he thought of this
passage. Osiander was prompted to his intervention by the view,
frequently defended in the later Middle Ages and now familiar to us as
the teaching of positivism, that ‘hypotheses are not articles of faith’
but merely ‘foundations for calculation’, so that it does not matter
whether they are true or false, provided that they reproduce exactly the
phenomena of motions. These quotations are taken from a letter written
by Osiander in 1541, entreating Copernicus to avoid a conflict with the
current Aristotelian and theological orthodoxy, by accepting a
conventionalist interpretation of his own theory.17</p>
<p>This interpretation was violently rejected by the Copernicans of the
next generation. Giordano Bruno called it the work of an ignorant and
presumptuous ass. Galileo agreed. Kepler declared: ’It is indeed a most
absurd fiction to explain natural phenomena by false causes.’18 The
issue engaged the contestants passionately to the death. Believing
Copernicanism to be true, Giordano Bruno enlarged it to a vision of an
indefinite multiplicity of solar systems, which anticipated the modern
conception of stellar spaces. Fifty-seven years after the death of
Copernicus, Bruno was burnt alive for his convictions. Galileo suffered
lesser persecution over a number of years for adhering to the view
(which he never sincerely abandoned) that the Copernican system was true
and not merely an economical hypothesis.</p>
<p>Was the issue which engaged such minds and roused such fateful
passions merely verbal: a question of the proper use of the word ‘true’?
Actually, both sides agreed on what they meant by ‘true’; namely, that
truth lies in the achievement of a contact with reality—a contact
destined to reveal itself further by an indefinite range of yet
unforeseen consequences. I believe accordingly—in view of the subsequent
history of astronomy—that the Copernicans were right in affirming the
truth of the new system, and the Aristotelians and theologians wrong in
conceding to it merely a formal advantage.19</p>
<p>But the long controversy between the two views shows also that this
distinction is as difficult as it is vital.20 The difficulty is merely
covered up by suggesting that a true discovery is characterized by its
fruitfulness, which a purely formal advance lacks. You cannot define the
indeterminate veridical powers of truth in terms of fruitfulness, unless
‘fruitful’ is itself qualified in terms of the definiendum. The
Ptolemaic system was a fruitful source of error for one thousand years;
astrology has been a fruitful source of income to astrologers for two
thousand five hundred years; Marxism is today a fruitful source of power
for the rulers of one third of mankind. When we say that Copernicanism
was fruitful, we mean that it was a fruitful source of truth, and we
cannot distinguish its kind of fruitfulness from that of the Ptolemaic
system, or of astrology, or Marxism, except by such a qualification. To
use the word ‘fruitful’ in this sense, without acknowledging it, is a
deceptive substitution, a pseudo-substitution, a Laplacean sleight of
hand.</p>
<p>But even when ‘fruitfulness’ is taken to mean the capacity for
leading to new truths, it is an insufficient characterization of truth.
Copernicanism could well have been a source of truth—as the apocryphal
text of Esdras was for Columbus—even if it had been false. But the
Copernican system did not anticipate the discoveries of Kepler and
Newton accidentally: it led to them because it was true. In saying this
we are using the term ‘true’ to acknowledge the indeterminate veridical
quality of Copernicanism: the quality which the Copernicans affirmed
against Osiander’s interpretation of the Copernican system. They
believed that this system was fruitful in this and in no other
sense.</p>
<p>Thus the substitution of ‘fruitful’ for ‘true’ is specious. But it is
also nonsensical, for it implies the manifestly absurd suggestion that
fruitfulness is a more concrete and limited quality which could be
ascertained without going all the way to establish truth. But at the
stage when we have to make up our minds about the merits of a discovery
its future repercussions are still unknown. By the time Newton published
his Principia anyone could see that Copernicus had been right; but
Copernicus and the Copernicans, and among these Newton himself, were
convinced of it long before this. The veridical quality of the system,
of which they were then convinced, could not be its subsequently
observed fruitfulness. The attempt to replace the quality of truth, in
which they believed, by the observation of the fruitfulness which this
belief anticipated, is like the Bellman’s advice for spotting a Snark by
its habit of dining the following day. The mark of true discovery is not
its fruitfulness but the intimation of its fruitfulness.</p>
<p>Admittedly—since the convenient reformulation of a theory may
considerably enhance the rate at which new consequences are derived from
it—a formal advantage also yields fruits, though not in the same sense
in which a new discovery is expected to prove fruitful by those who
accept it as true. But this objection to the anticipation of
fruitfulness as a criterion of true discovery dissolves altogether when
the formal advantage is of such magnitude that its contrivance does
amount to a discovery. The restatements of Newtonian mechanics by
d’Alembert, Maupertuis, Lagrange, and Hamilton embodied great
discoveries of this kind. Such discoveries are usually accompanied or
prepared by advances in mathematics, and their appreciation rests on
qualities which they share with mathematical discoveries, rather than
with discoveries in the natural sciences. So the recognition of their
presence in some theories of physics does not obliterate, though it
somewhat complicates, the distinction between a merely formal elegance
and the intellectual beauty of a theory, a beauty which establishes a
new contact with external reality.</p>
<p>However, my analysis has by now proliferated too widely from its
roots in the history of Copernicanism and Relativity. I must go no
further without first supplementing these paradigmatic cases by other
instances substantiating the nature of theoretical discovery in physics,
and the difference between such discovery and an advance of a purely
formal character.</p>
<p>The suggestion made by Louis de Broglie (1923), purely on grounds of
intellectual beauty, to ascribe wave nature to ponderable particles, is
a case in point. The professors (who included Paul Langevin) to whom he
presented the work for the Doctorate were doubtful whether to accept it
and wrote to Einstein for advice. The latter recognized its scientific
merit and the degree was duly awarded to its author.21 But no one
realised at the time that de Broglie’s formulae implied that electronic
beams would give diffraction patterns similar to those of X-rays, a
consequence which was first envisaged by W. Elsasser in 1925.22</p>
<p>Again, the mathematical framework by which Dirac succeeded (1928) in
reconciling quantum mechanics with relativity, showed some
incomprehensible features which were to turn out eventually to be a
description of the positive electron, when this particle was discovered,
independently, by Anderson in 1932. Among earlier examples of this kind
is the work of Willard Gibbs which was regarded as purely formal, until
Bakhuis Roozeboom discovered the wide and illuminating applicability of
the Phase Rule. More recently, the voluminous thermodynamic speculations
of de Donder, published without gaining any response in the 1920’s, came
into their own within the new thermodynamics of irreversible systems
which they were found to have partly anticipated. But the history of
science records only happy endings; far more frequent are formal
speculations which lead nowhere. The innumerable papers of van Laar on
the thermodynamic potential, published about the same time as de
Donder’s papers, may be remembered among a vast multitude of such
unfortunate cases. This dilution of the meritorious by floods of
triviality makes the recognition of true scientific value particularly
difficult.</p>
<p>Let me stop here for a moment. I believe that by now three things
have been established beyond reasonable doubt: the power of intellectual
beauty to reveal truth about nature; the vital importance of
distinguishing this beauty from merely formal attractiveness; and the
delicacy of the test between them, so difficult that it may baffle the
most penetrating scientific minds.</p>
<p>I might have closed this section with these conclusions and carried
them forward for later reflection; but I fear that in many readers’
minds the convincing power of my evidence may have evoked only a growing
feeling of uneasiness. I have watched many a university audience
listening to my account of intuitive discoveries silently, with sullen
distaste. Then anironical voice would ask whether the speaker thought
that there was any use at all in making experiments; and yet another,
whether on such grounds as these, explanations in terms of astrology
would not be equally justified. These are important questions.</p>
<p>The answer to the first is that experience is an indispensable clue
to the understanding of nature, even though it does not determine its
understanding. Einstein speaks of ‘ein intuitives Heranfühlen an die
Tatsachen’, which I should call a groping for the meaning of the facts.
In this empirical guidance of our groping lies all the
difference—elusive and yet utterly decisive—between a merely formal
advance and a new insight into the nature of things. Whence this
elusiveness? It is a reflection on the canvas of the highest scientific
achievement of the fact that we can never tell exactly what we mean, or
even whether we mean anything at all. Indeterminacy of meaning is not
eliminated, but only restricted, when we eventually decide to accept a
theory as a true statement of something new about nature. For, while we
heavily commit ourselves thereby to a belief concerning certain things,
such a belief can have no bearing on reality unless its scope is still
left indeterminate.</p>
<p>The answer to the second question, why we should prefer science to
astrology, cannot be given briefly. In the next section I shall approach
it by one step and a fairly conclusive reply will be reached at the end
of Part Three; but the whole of this book is but a quest for a
substantial reply to a question of this kind. In the end I should be
able to say as a statement that will appear neither dogmatic nor
trivial: ‘I do not entertain explanations in terms of astrology, for I
do not believe them to be true.’</p>
