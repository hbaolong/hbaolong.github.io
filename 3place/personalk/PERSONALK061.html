<h4 id="power-politics">10. POWER POLITICS</h4>
<p>We have seen that even though a public power were originally based on
terror, it could not fail to supplement its coercive force by
persuasion, and that the thoughts cultivated for the purpose of
controlling their people would inevitably gain ascendancy also to some
degree over the rulers’ own behaviour. Thus the abuse of a moral appeal
for immoral purposes seems to confirm by its outcome the intrinsic
liberating power of morality.</p>
<p>But the restraint which power incurs as the price of employing
morality for its own coercive purposes proves only that morality is an
indispensable, though self-willed, ally to power. It does not
demonstrate that morality can ever control power according to its own
principles; civic culture still remains dependent on force and material
ends, and remains therefore suspect. Nor does the history of free
societies dispel this suspicion. We see, on the contrary, how every new
moral issue has evoked a clash of interests; how often moral progress
had to be forced upon the privileged by the pressure of the oppressed;
how the existing distribution of privilege has always granted its
beneficiaries considerable powers to resist reforms that curtail their
advantage, and how they have perpetuated injustice by force. It may
indeed be argued (and I shall return to this point later) that since any
single reform of detail must rely on the existing social structure as on
its matrix, this structure and any iniquities inherent in it can never
be fundamentally improved by any series of piecemeal reforms. We may
still doubt, therefore, whether the rulers of any society, however
freely self-governed, will ever observe the claims of morality beyond
what is needed in order to delude their subjects (and their allies
abroad) to trust their professions of morality.</p>
<p>This doubt goes back to antiquity; in modern times it was first
revived by Machiavelli. Friedrich Meinecke, writing at the close of the
First World War, traced from Machiavelli—through a series of great
thinkers—the steadily growing acceptance by Continental political theory
of the necessary immorality of public power, both in ruling at home and
in the conduct of foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Meinecke interprets the ideological conflict between Germany and her
opponents in these terms. He thinks that Germany was accused of
immorality only because she frankly declared that Might was Right, while
the Anglo-Saxon powers, who acted no less unscrupulously, continued to
pay lip-service to morality. They gained an unfair moral advantage for
themselves by pointing at Germany’s honest professions of the
power-political principles which they themselves covertly followed.
Meinecke traces the origin of this situation to the realization by
German thought of the inevitable sinfulness of power and the bold
attempt of German philosophy to overcome this antinomy by conceiving of
morality as immanent in the rise of an intrinsically superior power. He
admits that the Germans were misguided by a brutalization of this
philosophy to which it is liable, but believes that the Anglo-Saxons
avoided a similar outcome only by turning a blind eye on the
contradictions between their professions and their practice.25</p>
<p>Meinecke’s account of political immoralism may serve as a landmark.
He saw the First World War as the first mass movement inspired by a
doctrine of violence and believing in its own intellectual and moral
superiority over its moralizing opponents. Yet he did not see that this
war was but a ripple before the approaching storm. In tracing the growth
of the ideas of Realpolitik he does not even mention Marxism. So he
could not suspect the total instability of moral principles in politics
which was to manifest itself in the revolutions of the twentieth
century.</p>
