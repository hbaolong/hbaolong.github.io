<h4 id="introduction">1. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>I HAVE arrived at the opening of this last chapter without having
suggested any definite theory concerning the nature of things; and I
shall finish this chapter without having presented any such theory. This
book tries to serve a different and in a sense perhaps more ambitious
purpose. Its aim is to re-equip men with the faculties which centuries
of critical thought have taught them to distrust. The reader has been
invited to use these faculties and contemplate thus a picture of things
restored to their fairly obvious nature. This is all the book was meant
to do. For once men have been made to realize the crippling mutilations
imposed by an objectivist framework—once the veil of ambiguities
covering up these mutilations has been definitively dissolved—many fresh
minds will turn to the task of reinterpreting the world as it is, and as
it then once more will be seen to be.</p>
<p>There is one more move to be made towards reopening this vision. I
have shown in the last two chapters what I mean by the achievements of
living beings and have exhibited in these examples the logic of
achievement. These were our results:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Living beings can be known only in terms of success or failure.
They comprise ascending levels of successful existing and
behaving.</p></li>
<li><p>We can know a successful system only by understanding it as a
whole, while being subsidiarily aware of its particulars; and we cannot
meaningfully study these particulars except with a bearing on the whole.
Moreover, the higher the level of success we are contemplating, the more
far-reaching must be our participation in our subject matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, to interpret systems that can succeed or fail in the
more detached terms, by which we know systems to which no distinction of
success or failure applies, is logically impossible. Systems that can
succeed or fail are properly characterized by operational principles, or
more generally, by certain rules of rightness; and our knowledge of any
class of things that is characterized by a rule of rightness disappears
when we attempt to define it in terms that are neutral to this
rightness.</p></li>
<li><p>Accordingly, it is as meaningless to represent life in terms of
physics and chemistry as it would be to interpret a grandfather clock or
a Shakespeare sonnet in terms of physics and chemistry; and it is
likewise meaningless to represent mind in terms of a machine or of a
neural model. Lower levels do not lack a bearing on higher levels; they
define the conditions of their success and account for their failures,
but they cannot account for their success, for they cannot even define
it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The step that remains to be taken in this chapter is to confront this
vision of an essentially stratified world with the facts of evolution.
We must face the fact that life has actually arisen from inanimate
matter, and that human beings—including the teachers of mankind who
first shaped our knowledge of rightness—have evolved from tiny creatures
resembling the parental zygote in which each of us had his individual
origin. I shall meet this situation by re-establishing within the logic
of achievement, the conception of emergence first postulated by Lloyd
Morgan and Samuel Alexander. The heuristic act of leaping across a
logical gap will prove paradigmatic in this respect. We shall find
indications of such inherently unformalizable processes at a variety of
levels and suggest that evolutionary achievements should be classed
among them.</p>
