<h4 id="science-and-technology">8. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</h4>
<p>In the list of three kinds of learning of which animals are capable I
have placed trick learning before sign learning, since motoricity is
fully developed in the lower animals before they achieve the capacity
for recording complex perceptions. Yet the capacity to perform a useful
action presupposes some purely intellectual control over the
circumstances in which the action is to take place. Technology always
involves the application of some empirical knowledge and this knowledge
may be part of natural science. Our contriving always makes use of some
anterior observing.</p>
<p>Putting it this way, we become aware of the incommensurability of the
two things combined in a technical performance. Suppose you hammer in a
nail. Before starting, you look at the hammer, the nail and the board
into which you will drive it; the result is knowledge which you can put
into words. Then you hammer in the nail. The result is a deed: something
is now firmly nailed on. Of this you can have knowledge, but it is not
itself knowledge. It is a material change which counts as an
achievement. Knowledge can be true or false, while action can only be
successful or unsuccessful, right or wrong.</p>
<p>It follows that an observing which prepares a contriving must seek
knowledge that is not merely true, but also useful as a guide to a
practical performance. It must strive for applicable knowledge.</p>
<p>The conceptual framework of applicable knowledge is different from
that of pure knowledge. It is determined primarily in terms of the
successful performances to which such knowledge is relevant. Take
hammering again. This performance implies the conception of a hammer,
which defines a class of objects that are (actual or potential) hammers.
It will include, apart from the usual tools of this kind, rifle butts,
shoe heels and fat dictionaries, and establish at the same time a
grading of these tools according to suitability. The suitability of an
object to serve as a hammer is an observable property, but it can be
observed only within the framework defined by the performance it is
supposed to serve.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of observable things which can be defined by
their participation in practical performances: (1) materials, (2) tools,
including all manner of installations, and (3) processes. Timber,
textiles, fuels, are technical materials; hammers, engines, houses,
railways, are tools or installations; fermentation, cooking, smelting,
are technical processes. Many of these technical conceptions comprise a
variety of otherwise disparate objects (for example, different kinds of
textiles, from cotton and wool to nylon and glass fibres, and different
means of lighting, from candles to discharge lamps), but all these
objects are specially prepared, shaped or otherwise so contrived as to
make them technically suitable. To this extent these classes of objects
or processes are known, and the individual objects or processes
themselves are intelligible only within the framework of a useful
performance which they successfully serve. Pure knowledge, lacking this
framework, and pure science in particular, ignore these classes and
cannot understand these contrivances. We cannot eliminate
instrumentality from technical knowledge, any more than we can represent
natural science in terms of practical procedure.</p>
<p>A gap is opening up here between two kinds of knowledge, both of
which refer to material things: one derived from an acknowledged
purpose, the other unrelated to any such purpose. The disparity of
science and technology which I am examining here will prove relevant
later to the relation between the science of inanimate things, in which
no purpose is apparent, and that of living beings which can be
understood only in teleological terms. We should keep this prospect in
mind while proceeding to elucidate further the characteristic logical
structure of technology.</p>
<p>Primitive technology may be regarded as a mere extension of bodily
skills employed for the satisfaction of bodily appetites. And even in
highly complex and predominantly articulate branches of technology, like
the manufacture of cloth or the production of steel, there is involved a
measure of unspecifiable know-how which is essential to the efficiency
of labour and the quality of its product. Manufacturing experience
remains a valuable qualification to a technician, and its possession by
the aggregate of a country’s technicians is a great national asset. But
even though the teachings of technical science can become effective only
by their skilful execution, the foundation of modern man’s technical
mastery lies in the explicit exposition of technology by textbooks,
journals, patents, etc.</p>
<p>Technology teaches action. This is made plain when it speaks in
imperatives, as it often does in cookery books or directions for the use
of machinery. The symbol at the head of a prescription is an imperative
prefacing an order to make up a medicine; crafts like weaving or welding
are taught in imperatives. All technology is equivalent to a conditional
command, for it is not possible to define a technology without
acknowledging, at least at second hand, the advantages which technical
operations might reasonably pursue. It is true, of course, that anything
a man does or can conceivably do, could be described as the pursuit of
an advantage if we imputed to him the purpose of achieving the
consequences of this action; but a technology which would teach all such
imputable purposes would be as meaningless as a science which would give
a list of all observable facts. A technology must therefore declare
itself in favour of a definite set of advantages, and tell people what
to do in order to secure them.</p>
<p>Technology teaches only actions to be undertaken for material
advantages by the use of implements according to (more or less)
specifiable rules.53 Such a rule is an operational principle. As
implements are defined and understood in terms of an action which they
serve, they are defined and understood likewise in terms of the
operational principle which tells how to perform such an action.54</p>
<p>I have spoken before of the operational principles which we observe
subsidiarily in the performance of a skill, and also of the operational
principles applied—again for the most part subsidiarily—in achieving
scientific knowledge. I have shown symbolic operations carried out
according to certain explicit rules and have noted that such operations
require that symbols should be manageable, just as tools have to be
serviceable. Modern electronic devices used for the automatic control of
technical processes show that some highly formalized operational
principles of technology can be readily affiliated to mathematical
operations. The meaning of technical implements resembles that of
mathematical symbols, in so far as they are both intended for use in a
certain range of operations, in the service of which they can be
replaced by a whole class of equally serviceable, though otherwise
disparate, entities. This kinship can be pursued through the whole
subsequent analysis of operational principles.</p>
<p>The difference between scientific knowledge and an operational
principle of technology is recognized by patent law, which draws a sharp
distinction between a discovery, which makes an addition to our
knowledge of nature, and an invention, which establishes a new
operational principle serving some acknowledged advantage. New
inventions rely as a rule on known facts of experience, but it may
happen that a new invention involves a new discovery. Yet the
distinction between the two will still hold: only the invention will be
granted protection by a patent, and not the discovery as such.</p>
<p>The reason is obvious. A patent has two functions, namely, publicly
to disclose its subject matter, and to grant a monopoly in respect to
its use. If applied to new knowledge its first function would preclude
the second: once such knowledge is publicly disclosed it can no longer
be anyone’s monopoly. But the patent can grant and enforce a monopoly
for the practice of any new operational principle; it can restrain
unauthorized persons from using the new invention which it makes
generally known.55</p>
<p>Invention has it in common with discovery that it can claim to be
what it is only if it is surprising. It must be separated from its
antecedents by a considerable logical gap. I have mentioned already that
in case of doubt the courts undertake to assess whether this logical gap
is wide enough to warrant the acknowledgment of an invention. This width
measures the ingenuity of the invention.</p>
<p>But a new operational principle may be acknowledged by patent law,
and yet not be an invention in the technological sense. A new ingenious
process for extracting tap-water from champagne may be an invention in
the sense of patent law, but it would not be acknowledged as such by
technology. For in addition to the disclosure of a new operational
principle, technology requires that an invention should be economic and
thus achieve a material advantage.</p>
<p>Hence any invention can be rendered worthless, and indeed farcical,
by a radical change in the values of the means used up and the ends
produced by it. If the price of all fuels went up one hundred-fold, all
steam engines, gas turbines, motor-cars and aeroplanes, would have to be
thrown on the junk heap. A brilliant invention is often rendered
nonsensical overnight by a better invention: tram-cars are as absurd
today as the horse-drawn buses which they once displaced. By contrast to
this, the validity of a scientific observation cannot be affected by
changes in the value of goods. If diamonds became as cheap as salt is
today, and salt as precious as diamonds are now, this would not
invalidate any part of the physics and chemistry of diamonds or of salt.
If either of the two minerals became so rare as to be practically
inaccessible, this might affect the interest attached to their study,
but it would leave unimpaired the validity of its results. Nor is there
any true parallel in science to the extinction of an invention by the
emergence of a more profitable way of achieving the same advantage.</p>
<p>The beauty of an invention differs accordingly from the beauty of a
scientific discovery. Originality is appreciated in both, but in science
originality lies in the power of seeing more deeply than others into the
nature of things, while in technology it consists in the ingenuity of
the artificer in turning known facts to a surprising advantage. The
heuristic passion of the technician centres therefore on his own
distinctive focus. He follows the intimations, not of a natural order,
but of a possibility for making things work in a new way for an
acceptable purpose, and cheaply enough to show a profit. In feeling his
way towards new problems, in collecting clues and pondering
perspectives, the technologist must keep in mind a whole panorama of
advantages and disadvantages which the scientist ignores. He must be
keenly susceptible to people’s wants and able to assess the price at
which they would be prepared to satisfy them. A passionate interest in
such momentary constellations is foreign to the scientist, whose eye is
fixed on the inner law of nature.</p>
<p>Hence there arises a conflict of values which makes it difficult to
mix the two occupations. From his experience of developing atomic
weapons in Los Alamos during the Second World War, J. R. Oppenheimer
wrote: ’The scientist is irritated by the practical preoccupations of
the man concerned with development, and the man concerned with
development thinks that the scientist is lazy and of no account and is
not doing a real job anyway. Therefore the laboratory very soon gets to
be all one thing or all the other.’56</p>
<p>This sharp division between science and technology is entirely
compatible with the existence of domains which in one respect or another
form a transition between them. The older crafts which still form the
majority of modern industries were invented by mere trial and error,
without the aid of science. By contrast, electrotechnics and much of
chemical technology are derived from the application of pure science to
practical problems. Hence there is the following interrelation between
science and technology. To the extent to which a technical process is an
application of scientific knowledge it contributes nothing to science,
while empirical technology, which is itself unscientific, may well
offer—for this very reason—important material for scientific
study.57</p>
<p>We have, correspondingly, two forms of enquiry that lie between
science and technology. Technologies founded on an application of
science may form a scientific system of their own. Electrotechnics and
the theory of aerodynamics are examples of systematic technology which
can be cultivated in the same way as pure science. Yet their
technological character is apparent in the fact that they might lose all
interest and fall into oblivion, if a radical change of economic
relationships were to destroy their practical usefulness. On the other
hand, it may happen that some parts of pure science offer such
exceptionally ample sources of technically useful information that they
are thought worth cultivation for this reason, though they would
otherwise lack sufficient interest. The scientific study of coal,
metals, wool, cotton, etc., are branches of such technically justified
science.</p>
<p>Systematic technology and technically justified science are two
fields of study lying between pure science and pure technology. But the
two fields may overlap completely. The discovery of insulin as a cure
for diabetes was an important contribution to science, owing to the
intrinsic interest of its subject matter; it was also the invention of
an operational principle serving to cure diabetes. The same quality
applies over large parts of pharmacology. It holds, indeed, wherever a
process inherent in nature is interesting to science owing to the
importance of its outcome, while at the same time it can also be
operated at will for achieving this desirable outcome. Such coincidences
between science and technology are fully accounted for by the same
principles which define them in general as completely disparate
domains.58</p>
<p>Nothing could have appeared more obvious until recently than this
difference between pure science and technology. It is unquestioningly
embodied in the general framework of higher education, as shown by its
division into universities and colleges of technology; it is expressed
in the current distinctions between pure and applied chemistry, pure and
applied physics, pure and applied mathematics, etc., in the description
of university chairs, journals and international congresses; it
determines the conditions of employment of scientists in universities on
the one hand and industrial laboratories on the other; it underlies the
operation of the patent law.</p>
<p>This framework survives practically unchanged in the countries not
subject to Marxism and has not been altogether abandoned in the Soviet
Union either. But since the rise around 1930 of the Neo-Marxian theory
of science, which became within the subsequent decade the official
doctrine of the U.S.S.R. and gained widespread influence outside it, the
distinction between science and technology, even where still upheld in
practice by the continued operation of these institutions, is violently
challenged in principle.</p>
<p>This is part of the drive, described earlier on, for subordinating
cultural values to a radically utilitarian conception of the public
good: a materialistic outlook paradoxically imbued by inordinate moral
aspirations. Such an attack is of course double-edged. It denies the
effectiveness of pure intellectual passions in guiding scientific
discovery, by affirming that every important step in the progress of
science occurs in response to a specific practical interest; while it
also denounces the pursuit of science for its own sake as irresponsible,
selfish, immoral. Taken literally, the two attacks are mutually
incompatible, for something that does not really happen cannot be
denounced as morally wrong. But the materialistic interpretation of
culture is a disguised imperative: it both declares that culture really
is, and decrees that it ought to be, the servant of welfare. This is
part of the Laplacean system in which morality must seek the sanction of
science by representing itself in terms of scientific predictions.59</p>
<p>I am not much concerned here with the question how serious this
menace to science may prove in practice. While the official repudiation
by Stalinist orthodoxy of science pursued for its own sake led to the
persecution and death in 1942 of Russia’s most distinguished biologist,
N. I. Vavilov, and had resulted by 1948 in the suppression or serious
distortion of various branches of biology, it seems otherwise to have
imposed on natural scientists little more restraint than the obligation
falsely to declare their work to be guided by its practical usefulness.
And this may be all. People may perhaps continue indefinitely to
cultivate pure science, while professing a theory of science which
exposes this occupation as a pretence or condemns it as an abuse. Yet
the spread of this doctrine among scientists in countries where they are
not compelled to subscribe to it, does raise the question which is
relevant for us here, whether the distinctive passions which animate the
cultivation of science may be superseded one day by other passions, or
may even simply fade away for lack of response to them.</p>
<p>I have answered the last question in the positive sense, when warning
that science may be once more discredited, as it was by St. Augustine,
if it cannot avoid denaturing our conception of man.60 The appreciation
of natural science is of recent origin and its tradition is rooted in a
limited area. It is a single shoot of one civilization among many others
of equal antiquity and richness. The Greeks never developed a systematic
natural science, nor did Byzantium or China, despite their technological
achievements.61 Today we can speak confidently of sixteenth-and
seventeenth-century science only because, with modern hindsight, we can
easily separate the genuine works of science from unscientific
admixtures. Kepler’s Harmonics, published in 1619, was imbued with
astrology, and it is typical in this respect of much subsequent writing
among scientists for the following two or three generations. I have
mentioned already that Glanvill, one of the founders of the Royal
Society in 1660, argued persistently for the acknowledgment of
witchcraft. Another founding fellow, John Aubrey, published little else
than a treatise on occult phenomena.62 The Cartesian spirit dominating
France at that time was a-prioristic rather than experimental. Newton
himself still occasionally used religious arguments in science; for
example when he suggested that God gave the world an atomic structure,
as most conducive to his purpose. The great controversies of the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries show that the struggle against
intrusion of extraneous points of view into science have never ceased
and that grave differences continue to persist in respect to these
issues between a dominant majority and various dubiously established
minorities of scientists. Yet we may acknowledge that by the time
Newton’s influence became prevalent, and particularly through his
Optics, the method of observational science became effectively
consolidated. Since then, in spite of such uncertainties and vagaries as
I have described in the section on Scientific Controversies, we may
recognize a coherent body of men, standing in the same scientific
tradition, moved by the proper temper and true appreciation of science.
Arago acclaiming Leverrier’s discovery of Neptune in 1846 as ’one of the
noblest titles of his country to the gratitude and admiration of
posterity’63 expressed this in clear accents. No contribution to
knowledge could be more useless than was the discovery of this remote
new planet.</p>
<p>Actually, up to that time natural science had made no major
contribution to technology. The industrial revolution had been achieved
without scientific aid. Except for the Morse telegraph, the great London
Exhibition of 1851 contained no important industrial devices or products
based on the scientific progress of the previous fifty years. The
appreciation of science was still almost free from utilitarian
motives.</p>
<p>But these sentiments were held within a very small area and were
shared at no time by more than a minority of the local population. The
migration of science overseas and into Asian and African countries
occurred slowly at a later period, when the medical, industrial and
military value of science had greatly increased and could serve to
recommend the reception of science to industrially less developed
countries. These auspices did not favour a true appreciation of science.
In all parts of the world where science is just beginning to be
cultivated, it suffers from a lack of response to its true values.
Consequently, the authorities grant insufficient time for research;
politics play havoc with appointments; businessmen deflect interest from
science by subsidizing only practical projects. However rich the fund of
local genius may be, such an environment will fail to bring it to
fruition. In the early phase in question, New Zealand loses its
Rutherford, Australia its Alexander and its Bragg, and such losses
retard further the growth of science in a new country. Rarely, if ever,
was the final acclimatization of science outside Europe achieved, until
the government of a country succeeded in inducing a few scientists from
some traditional centre to settle down in their territory and to develop
there a new home for scientific life, moulded on their own traditional
standards.64</p>
<p>Encircled today between the crude utilitarianism of the philistine
and the ideological utilitarianism of the modern revolutionary movement,
the love of pure science may falter and die. And if this sentiment were
lost, the cultivation of science would lose the only driving force which
can guide it towards the achievement of true scientific value. The
opinion is widespread that the cultivation of science would always be
continued for the sake of its practical advantages. It was expected, for
example, that Lysenko’s theories, if false, would be soon abandoned by
the Soviet Government because they could produce no useful results. This
expectation overlooked the fact that such questions cannot be decided in
practice. Lysenko’s theories are actually the theoretical conclusions
which Michurin in Russia and Burbank in the U.S. derived from their
substantial successes as plant-breeders.65 Almost every major systematic
error which has deluded men for thousands of years relied on practical
experience. Horoscopes, incantations, oracles, magic, witchcraft, the
cures of witch doctors and of medical practitioners before the advent of
modern medicine, were all firmly established through the centuries in
the eyes of the public by their supposed practical successes. The
scientific method was devised precisely for the purpose of elucidating
the nature of things under more carefully controlled conditions and by
more rigorous criteria than are present in the situations created by
practical problems. These conditions and criteria can be discovered only
by taking a purely scientific interest in the matter, which again can
exist only in minds educated in the appreciation of scientific value.
Such sensibility cannot be switched on at will for purposes alien to its
inherent passion. No important discovery can be made in science by
anyone who does not believe that science is important—indeed supremely
important—in itself.66</p>
<p>In saying this, I have acknowledged that values which I deem to be
transcendent may be known only transiently to a small minority of
mankind. There is no contradiction in this: it correctly reflects the
fact that universal validity is not an observed fact. When we say that a
statement is generally accepted or that no sane person would deny it,
etc., we are saying something about the attitude of people towards the
statement, which accredits the statement only if we accredit those
people’s judgment of it. But there is no general warrant to do this: the
maxim ‘quod semper, ubique, ab omnibus’ has often proved erroneous. The
standards by which we observe or appraise can never be derived from
statistical surveys.</p>
<p>Indeed, we cannot look at our standards in the process of using them,
for we cannot attend focally to elements that are used subsidiarily for
the purpose of shaping the present focus of our attention. We attribute
absoluteness to our standards, because by using them as part of
ourselves we rely on them in the ultimate resort, even while recognizing
that they are actually neither part of ourselves nor made by ourselves,
but external to ourselves. Yet this reliance can take place only in some
momentary circumstance, at some particular place and time, and our
standards will be granted absoluteness within this historical context.
So I could properly profess that the scientific values upheld by the
tradition of modern science are eternal, even though I feared that they
might soon be lost for ever. This duality will be stabilized later
within the concept of commitment.</p>
