<h4 id="the-growth-of-mechanism">2. THE GROWTH OF MECHANISM</h4>
<p>The story is in three parts, of which the first begins long before
Copernicus, though it leads straight up to him. It starts with
Pythagoras, who lived a century before Socrates. Even so, Pythagoras was
a late-comer in science, for the scientific movement was started almost
a generation earlier on rather different lines by the Ionian school of
Thales. Pythagoras and his followers did not, like the Ionians, try to
describe the universe in terms of certain material elements (fire, air,
water, etc.) but interpreted it exclusively in terms of numbers. They
took numbers to be the ultimate substance, as well as the form, of
things and processes. When sounding an octave they believed they could
hear the simple numerical ratio of 1:2 in the harmonious chiming of the
sounds from two wires whose lengths had the ratio 1:2. Acoustics made
the perfection of simple numerical relations audible to their ear. They
turned their eyes towards the heavens and saw the perfect circle of the
sun and moon; they watched the diurnal rotation of the firmament and,
studying the planets, saw them governed by a complex system of steady
circular motions; and they apprehended these celestial perfections in
the way one listens to a pure musical interval. They listened to the
music of the spheres in a state of mystic communion.</p>
<p>The revival of astronomical theory by Copernicus after two millennia
was a conscious return to the Pythagorean tradition. While studying law
in Bologna, he worked with the professor of astronomy, Novara, a leading
Platonist, who taught that the universe was to be conceived in terms of
simple mathematical relationships. Then, on his return to Cracow, with
the thought of a heliocentric system in his mind, he made a further
study of the philosophers and traced his new conception of the universe
back to writers of antiquity standing in the Pythagorean tradition.</p>
<p>After Copernicus, Kepler continued wholeheartedly the Pythagorean
quest for harmonious numbers and geometrical excellence. In the volume
containing the first statement of his Third Law, we can see him
speculating intensely on the way the sun, which is the centre of the
cosmos and therefore somehow nous (Reason) itself, apprehends the
celestial music performed by the planets: ‘Of what sort vision is in the
sun, what are its eyes, or what other impulse it has . . . even without
eyes . . . for judging the harmonies of the (celestial) motions,’ it
would be ‘for those inhabiting the earth, not easy to conjecture’—yet
one may at least dream, ‘lulled by the changing harmony of the band of
planets’, that ‘in the sun there dwells an intellect simple,
intellectual fire or mind, whatever it may be, the fountain of all
harmony’.1 He even went so far as to write down the tune of each planet
in musical notation.</p>
<p>To Kepler astronomic discovery was ecstatic communion, as he voiced
it in a famous passage of the same work:</p>
<p>What I prophesied two-and-twenty years ago, as soon as I discovered
the five solids among the heavenly orbits—what I firmly believed long
before I had seen Ptolemy’s Harmonics—what I had promised my friends in
the title of this fifth book, which I named before I was sure of my
discovery—what sixteen years ago I urged to be sought—that for which I
have devoted the best part of my life to astronomical contemplations,
for which I joined Tycho Brahe . . . at last I have brought it to light,
and recognized its truth beyond all my hopes. . . . So now since
eighteen months ago the dawn, three months ago the proper light of day,
and indeed a very few days ago the pure Sun itself of the most
marvellous contemplation has shone forth—nothing holds me; I will
indulge my sacred fury; I will taunt mankind with the candid confession
that I have stolen the golden vases of the Egyptians, in order to build
of them a tabernacle to my God, far indeed from the bounds of Egypt. If
you forgive me, I shall rejoice; if you are angry, I shall bear it; the
die is cast, the book is written, whether to be read now or by posterity
I care not; it may wait a hundred years for its reader, if God himself
has waited six thousand years for a man to contemplate His work.2</p>
<p>What Kepler claimed here about the Platonic bodies was nonsense, and
his exclamation about God’s having waited for him for thousands of years
was a literary fancy; yet his outburst conveys a true idea of the
scientific method and of the nature of science; an idea which has since
been disfigured by the sustained attempt to remodel it in the likeness
of a mistaken ideal of objectivity.</p>
<p>Passing from Kepler to Galileo, we see the transition to a dynamics
in which for the first time numbers enter as measured quantities into
mathematical formulae. But with Galileo this usage applies only to
terrestrial events, while in respect to heavenly motions he still holds
the Pythagorean view that the book of nature is written in geometrical
characters.3 In the Two Great Systems of the World (1632), he argues in
the Pythagorean tradition from the principle that the parts of the world
are perfectly ordered.4 He still believes that the motion of the
heavenly bodies—in fact all natural motion as such—must be circular.
Rectilinear motion implies change of place, and this can occur only from
disorder to order: that is, either in the transition from primeval chaos
to the right disposition of the parts of the world, or in violent
motion, i.e. in the endeavour of a body artificially moved to return to
its ‘natural’ place. Once world order is established, all bodies are
‘naturally’ at rest or in circular motion. Galileo’s observations of
inertial motion along a plane terrestrial surface were interpreted by
him as circular motions around the centre of the earth.</p>
<p>Thus the first century after the death of Copernicus was inspired by
Pythagorean intimations. Their last great manifestation was perhaps
Descartes’s universal mathematics: his hope of establishing scientific
theories by the apprehension of clear and distinct ideas, which as such
were necessarily true.</p>
<p>But a different line of approach was already advancing gradually,
stemming from the other line of Greek thought which lacked the mysticism
of Pythagoras, and which recorded observations of all kinds of things,
however imperfect. This school, derived from the Ionian philosophers,
culminated in Democritus, a contemporary of Socrates, who first taught
men to think in materialistic terms. He laid down the principle: ‘By
convention coloured, by convention sweet, by convention bitter; in
reality only atoms and the void.’5 With this Galileo himself agreed; the
mechanical properties of things alone were primary (to borrow Locke’s
terminology), their other properties were derivative, or secondary.
Eventually it was to appear that the primary qualities of such a
universe could be brought under intellectual control by applying
Newtonian mechanics to the motions of matter, while its secondary
qualities could be derived from this underlying primary reality. Thus
emerged the mechanistic conception of the world which prevailed
virtually unchanged till the end of the last century. This too was a
theoretical and objective view, in the sense of replacing the evidence
of our senses by a formal space-time map that predicted the motions of
the material particles which were supposed to underlie all external
experience. In this sense the mechanistic world-view was fully
objective. Yet there is a definite change from the Pythagorean to the
Ionian conception of theoretical knowledge. Numbers and geometrical
forms are no longer assumed to be inherent as such in Nature. Theory no
longer reveals perfection; it no longer contemplates the harmonies of
Creation. In Newtonian mechanics the formulae governing the mechanical
substratum of the universe were differential equations, containing no
numerical rules and exhibiting no geometrical symmetry. Henceforth
‘pure’ mathematics, formerly the key to nature’s mysteries, became
strictly separated from the application of mathematics to the
formulation of empirical laws. Geometry became the science of empty
space; and analysis, affiliated since Descartes to geometry, seceded
with it into the region beyond experience. Mathematics represented all
rational thinking which appeared necessarily true; while reality was
summed up in the events of the world which were seen as contingent—that
is, merely such as happened to be the case.</p>
<p>The separation of reason and experience was pressed further by the
discovery of non-Euclidean geometry. Mathematics was thereafter denied
the capacity of stating anything beyond sets of tautologies formulated
within a conventional framework of notations. Physical theories were
correspondingly also subjected to a further reduction of status. Towards
the end of the nineteenth century a new positivist philosophy arose,
denying to the scientific theories of physics any claim to inherent
rationality, a claim which it condemned as metaphysical and mystical.
The earliest, most energetic and influential development of this idea
was due to Ernst Mach, who by his book, Die Mechanik, published in 1883,
founded the Vienna school of positivism. Scientific theory, according to
Mach, is merely a convenient summary of experience. Its purpose is to
save time and trouble in recording observations. It is the most
economical adaptation of thought to facts, and just as external to the
facts as a map, a timetable, or a telephone directory; indeed, this
conception of scientific theory would include a timetable or a telephone
directory among scientific theories.</p>
<p>Accordingly, scientific theory is denied all persuasive power that is
intrinsic to itself, as theory. It must not go beyond experience by
affirming anything that cannot be tested by experience; and above all,
scientists must be prepared immediately to drop a theory the moment an
observation turns up which conflicts with it. In so far as a theory
cannot be tested by experience—or appears not capable of being so
tested—it ought to be revised so that its predictions are restricted to
observable magnitudes.</p>
<p>This view, which can be traced back to Locke and Hume, and which in
its massive modern absurdity has almost entirely dominated
twentieth-century thinking on science, seems to be the inevitable
consequence of separating, in principle, mathematical knowledge from
empirical knowledge. I shall now proceed to the story of relativity,
which is supposed to have brilliantly confirmed this view of science,
and shall show why in my opinion it has supplied on the contrary some
striking evidence for its refutation.</p>
