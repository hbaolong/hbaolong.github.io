1954, ch. IV, ‘The Small Group’, pp. 64 ff. Cf. the account of the

<li><p>Bertrand de Jouvenel in Sovereignty, Cambridge, 1957, p. 290,

<li><p>This is a simplified variant of the consistency requirement which
I called ‘self-confirmatory progression’ and formulated as follows in
Part Two, ch. 6, p. 142: ‘Only by accrediting the exercise of our
intellectual passions in the act of describing man and society can we
form conceptions of man and society which both endorse this accrediting
and uphold the freedom of culture in society.’</p></li>
<li><p>Considering that Who’s Who contains about 15,000 names of
scientists, artists, writers, etc., we may estimate that the 250 million
English speaking people rely on about 20–30,000 intellectual leaders;
i.e. on one in ten thousand.</p></li>

<li><p>The Bolsheviks fought hard to obtain the support of the Congress
of Soviets, after they had captured sufficient armed power to dissolve
this assembly. (Leonard Schapiro, The Origin of the Communist Autocracy,
London, 1955, p. 68.) Hitler had been Chancellor for a month when he set
in motion a series of manœuvres by which he eventually forced the
Reichstag to invest him with absolute powers. Both Stalin and Hitler
used their coercive powers regularly to compel expressions of popular
support for themselves and continued to address assemblies of men
elected at their command in order to earn their unanimous applause.
Napoleon struggled throughout his career to strengthen the legality of
his rule and his fall was due to the fact that he never fully achieved
this aim.</p></li>
<li><p>Stalin must have believed the extorted confessions of the Kremlin
doctors accused of attempting to assassinate the Soviet leaders; for he
could have had no other reason for ordering the execution of these
politically insignificant men who were rendering him valuable
professional services. Hitler’s secret extermination of the Jews, as
well as his obstinate wooing of England whose attitude he could not
understand, were both determined by his belief in the racial theories
used in his propaganda.</p></li>

ch. 5.</p></li>
<li><p>I. Berlin, Karl Marx, Oxford, 1939, p. 10.</p></li>
<li><p>Hannah Arendt, The Burden of Our Time, London, 1951, p. 301. See
also G. A. Almond (The Appeals of Communism, Princeton, 1954, p. 22),
where a quantitative analysis of the chief propagandistic writings of
Lenin and Stalin shows that 94 per cent to 99 per cent of the references
to the communist party and its activities describe it as seizing,
manipulating and consolidating power. This is true even of Stalin’s
History, which covers a substantial part of the period during which the
party has held power in the Soviet Union. The self-contradictions of
Marxists mentioned in the text have been frequently pointed out, but it
has not been realized that it is these very contradictions that generate
the convincing power of the doctrine. For some recent references see
notes to pp. 230 and 239. Throughout this chapter the term ‘Marxism’ is
used rather for describing a current ideology, than the hypothetical
beliefs of Marx himself.</p></li>
<li><p>‘Participation’ as defined by Levy-Brühl and ‘immanence’
identified with it in my text, are merely extensions of the semantic
relation between something that means another thing and the other thing
meant by it. In this case the meaningful thing is not a symbol but a
striking event which ‘assimilates’ what it means to the extent of
affirming the presence of this thing within itself.</p></li>
<li><p>This is about how A. J. Ayer has recently put the matter
(Encounter, 5 (1955), p. 32). A year before that John Plamenatz had
summed up his analysis epigrammatically in German Marxism and Russian
Communism (London, 1954), p. 50, as follows: ‘. . . whatever the
relation of science and socialism as parts of the life of one man, what
he can never be is a scientific socialist. Not even if his science
predicts what his socialism approves. “Scientific socialism” is a
logical absurdity, a myth, a revolutionary slogan, the happy inspiration
of two moralists who wanted to be unlike all moralists before them.’ In
a recent book, The Illusion of an Epoch (London, 1955), Professor H. B.
Acton has re-examined the whole question once more in great detail, only
to conclude: ‘The Marxist can derive moral precepts from his social
science only to the extent that they already form, because of the
vocabulary used, a concealed and unacknowledged part of it’
(p. 190).</p></li>
<li><p>Crankshaw, op. cit., p. 28 quotes Himmler’s highly moral
exhortations to massacre all Jews. The author concludes his book
(p. 247) by calling this attitude, widespread among the Gestapo,
‘idealism gone rotten’.</p></li>
<li><p>The Logic of Liberty, Chicago and London, 1951, p. 106. I have
shown there also that moral inversion is but the consolidation of a
pseudo-substitution, i.e. the transformation of a spurious moral
inversion into an actual one. The view that a free society is one
accepting the service of truth and justice, and that totalitarianism is
the outcome (by inversion) of a scepticism denying intrinsic force to
the ideas of truth and justice, was first outlined in my Science, Faith
and Society (1946).</p></li>

<li><p>Czeslaw Milosz, La Grande Tentation, published by the Congress
for Cultural Freedom, Paris, 1952. The argument is enlarged in Czeslaw
Milosz, The Captive Mind, New York, 1953.</p></li>
<li><p>‘The successes of Communism among the intellectuals were due
mainly to their desire to have value guaranteed, if not by God, at least
by history.’ Czeslaw Milosz in Confluence (Harvard), 5 (1956),
p. 14.</p></li>
<li><p>Bukharin explained to the author, on the occasion of a visit to
Moscow in March, 1935, that pure science, as distinct from technology,
can exist only in a class society.</p></li>
<li><p>Bochenski, Der Sowietrussische Dialektische Materialismus, Bern,
1950, quotes (p. 142) the Soviet writer M. D. Kammari (1947 and 1948)
for the view that Marxism is objectively true because the true interests
of science coincide with the interests of the proletariat and with the
objective movement of history. But Bochenski himself condemns Marxism as
manifestly self-contradictory (pp. 156–7). Sidney Hook, in Marx and the
Marxists (New York, 1955), points out the same self-contradiction
(pp. 45–6).</p></li>
<li><p>‘Factuality’ is Hannah Arendt’s expression.</p></li>
<li><p>See Bertram D. Wolfe, Three Who Made a Revolution, New York,
1948, pp. 534–57. ‘There was something’, he writes, ‘in the Russian
temperament and scene which engendered these men of ambivalent spirit
and double role, these Gapons, Azevs, Kaplinskys, Bagrovs and
Malinovskys—figures without parallel in the police and revolutionary
movements of other lands.’ But these figures actually tend to reappear
wherever two secret organizations oppose each other. Since only few
initiates know the identity of the members it is comparatively easy to
plant spies among them, and these spies will tend to play a double role.
They will earn their pay by occasionally denouncing some terrorists and
accredit themselves with the revolutionary side by taking part in acts
of violence against government officials. When this double-crossing has
been practised for many years, as in the case of Malinovsky—who went on
with it from 1902 until his execution in 1918—it is no longer possible
to say, even with a complete knowledge of the facts, which side the man
betrayed and which he served.</p></li>
<li><p>Hannah Arendt, op. cit., p. 372.</p></li>
<li><p>George Orwell, in Nineteen-eighty-four, London, 1949, p. 250, has
already said that belief in reality is a subversive principle under
totalitarianism.</p></li>
<li><p>‘The slightest criticism of the state of affairs in Soviet
linguistics, even the most timid attempt to criticize the so-called “new
doctrine” in linguistics, was persecuted and suppressed by the leading
linguistic circles. Valuable workers and researchers in linguistics were
dismissed from their posts or demoted for being critical of N. Y. Marr’s
heritage, or expressing the slightest disapproval of his teachings.
Linguistic scholars were appointed to leading posts not on their merits,
but because of their unqualified acceptance of N. Y. Marr’s theories’
(I. V. Stalin, Concerning Marxism in Linguistics, Soviet News Booklet,
London, 1950, p. 22).</p></li>
