<h4 id="two-kinds-of-awareness">5. TWO KINDS OF AWARENESS</h4>
<p>What I have said of the unspecifiability of skills is closely related
to the findings of Gestalt psychology. Yet my evaluation of this
material is so different from that of Gestalt theory, that I shall
prefer not to refer here to this theory, even though I shall continue to
draw on its domain and pursue some arguments on lines closely parallel
to that of its teachings. This should be borne in mind for the following
analysis of the often discussed situation in which we find ourselves
when using a tool, for example when driving in a nail by the strokes of
a hammer.</p>
<p>When we use a hammer to drive in a nail, we attend to both nail and
hammer, but in a different way. We watch the effect of our strokes on
the nail and try to wield the hammer so as to hit the nail most
effectively. When we bring down the hammer we do not feel that its
handle has struck our palm but that its head has struck the nail. Yet in
a sense we are certainly alert to the feelings in our palm and the
fingers that hold the hammer. They guide us in handling it effectively,
and the degree of attention that we give to the nail is given to the
same extent but in a different way to these feelings. The difference may
be stated by saying that the latter are not, like the nail, objects of
our attention, but instruments of it. They are not watched in
themselves; we watch something else while keeping intensely aware of
them. I have a subsidiary awareness of the feeling in the palm of my
hand which is merged into my focal awareness of my driving in the
nail.</p>
<p>We may think of the hammer replaced by a probe, used for exploring
the interior of a hidden cavity. Think how a blind man feels his way by
the use of a stick, which involves transposing the shocks transmitted to
his hand and the muscles holding the stick into an awareness of the
things touched by the point of the stick. We have here the transition
from ‘knowing how’ to ‘knowing what’ and can see how closely similar is
the structure of the two.</p>
<p>Subsidiary awareness and focal awareness are mutually exclusive. If a
pianist shifts his attention from the piece he is playing to the
observation of what he is doing with his fingers while playing it, he
gets confused and may have to stop.8 This happens generally if we switch
our focal attention to particulars of which we had previously been aware
only in their subsidiary role.</p>
<p>The kind of clumsiness which is due to the fact that focal attention
is directed to the subsidiary elements of an action is commonly known as
self-consciousness. A serious and sometimes incurable form of it is
‘stage-fright’, which seems to consist in the anxious riveting of one’s
attention to the next word—or note or gesture—that one has to find or
remember. This destroys one’s sense of the context which alone can
smoothly evoke the proper sequence of words, notes, or gestures. Stage
fright is eliminated and fluency recovered if we succeed in casting our
mind forward and let it operate with a clear view to the comprehensive
activity in which we are primarily interested.</p>
<p>Here again the particulars of a skill appear to be unspecifiable, but
this time not in the sense of our being ignorant of them. For in this
case we can ascertain the details of our performance quite well, and its
unspecifiability consists in the fact that the performance is paralysed
if we focus our attention on these details. We may describe such a
performance as logically unspecifiable, for we can show that in a sense
the specification of the particulars would logically contradict what is
implied in the performance or context in question.</p>
<p>Take for example the identification of a thing as a tool. It implies
that a useful purpose can be achieved by handling the thing as an
instrument for that purpose. I cannot identify the thing as a tool if I
do not know what it is for—or if knowing its supposed purpose, I believe
it to be useless for that purpose. Let me denote by p the affirmations
which are implied in qualifying a thing as a tool. If I know or at least
hypothetically entertain p, the thing is a tool to me; if not, it is
something else. It may be an animal, like Alice’s croquet hammer which
walked away because it was a flamingo. But in most cases, if I come
across a tool of which I do not know the use, it will merely strike me
as a peculiarly shaped object. To regard it merely as such is to imply
that I do not believe and do not even hypothetically entertain p; which
of course denies that I believe or at least hypothetically entertain
p. And since p asserts something very uncommon, my not believing p
virtually amounts to my asserting not-p.</p>
<p>An extension of this scheme may allow us to apply it also to the
classic theme of Gestalt psychology, which is that the particulars of a
pattern or a tune must be apprehended jointly, for if you observe the
particulars separately they form no pattern or tune. It may be argued
that my attending to the pattern or tune as a whole implies its being
appreciated as a pattern or a tune, and this would be contradicted by
switching my focal attention to the single notes of the tune or the
fragments of the pattern. But it is perhaps more appropriate to
formulate the contradiction in this case in more general terms, by
saying that our attention can hold only one focus at a time and that it
would hence be self-contradictory to be both subsidiarily and focally
aware of the same particulars at the same time.</p>
<p>This scheme can be easily reformulated and expanded in terms of
meaning. If we discredit the usefulness of a tool, its meaning as a tool
is gone. All particulars become meaningless if we lose sight of the
pattern which they jointly constitute.</p>
<p>The most pregnant carriers of meaning are of course the words of a
language, and it is interesting to recall that when we use words in
speech or writing we are aware of them only in a subsidiary manner. This
fact, which is usually described as the transparency of language, may be
illustrated by a homely episode from my own experience. My
correspondence arrives at my breakfast table in various languages, but
my son understands only English. Having just finished reading a letter I
may wish to pass it on to him, but must check myself and look again to
see in what language it was written. I am vividly aware of the meaning
conveyed by the letter, yet know nothing whatever of its words. I have
attended to them closely but only for what they mean and not for what
they are as objects. If my understanding of the text were halting, or
its expressions or its spelling were faulty, its words would arrest my
attention. They would become slightly opaque and prevent my thought from
passing through them unhindered to the things they signify.</p>
