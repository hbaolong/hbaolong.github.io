<h4 id="inference">8. INFERENCE</h4>
<p>Our intellectual superiority over the animals is almost entirely due
to our powers of symbolic operations; it is only by relying on these
that we are able to carry out any process of consecutive reasoning. No
wonder then that the movement bent on the ideal of impersonal thought
has consistently aimed at reducing this central agency of human
intelligence to operations governed by strict rules. This hope was
recently heightened by the construction of highly effective automatic
devices for various complex purposes. Anti-aircraft guns were equipped
with predictors automatically governed by the gunner’s initial readings.
Once the sights were set on a plane, the machines computed the course of
the swiftly moving target, as well as that of the projectile ready to be
sent out, and aimed the gun so as to assure a hit. There followed the
construction of automatic pilots and of guided missiles, and the
comprehensive automation of work in office and factory. Here were
instruments carrying out complex feats of intelligence without any
intervention of man. This clearly offered new prospects for attaining
the ideal of completely detached thought.</p>
<p>Since I have spoken already (and shall yet say more later) of the
impossibility of formalizing the process of empirical inference, I shall
deal here only with the attempt to depersonalize the process of
deductive inference.</p>
<p>We have seen before that deductive reasoning may be altogether
ineffable and that even the most completely formalized logical
operations must include an unformalized tacit coefficient. We have seen
how the passionate force of this coefficient actuates discovery,
inflames controversy, and sustains the student’s efforts to understand
what he is being taught; we have seen how these passions are shared
between mathematicians working in different fields, so that they will
always be guided by common standards which they enforce on each other by
their professional consensus. I shall refer in the following to the
widely ramified operations of these tacit coefficients in the deductive
sciences only in brief formal terms. By compendiously designating this
whole aggregate of personal commitments, I shall lend to my argument
sufficient rigidity for carrying the burden I shall presently place upon
it.</p>
<p>The operations of digital computers as machines of logical inference
coincide with the operations of symbolic logic. We may therefore
identify the formalization involved in the construction and the use of
machines, operating in this particular way, with the procedure governing
the construction of a deductive system. This procedure is threefold. (1)
It designates undefined terms; (2) it specifies unproven asserted
formulae (axioms); and (3) it prescribes the handling of such formulae
for the purpose of writing down new asserted formulae (proofs). This
result is achieved by a sustained effort to eliminate what are called
‘psychological’ elements—the factors which I call ‘tacit’. The undefined
terms are intended to stand without signifying anything, complete in
themselves as marks on paper; unproven asserted formulae are to replace
statements believed to be self-evident; operations constituting ‘formal
proof’ are similarly intended to replace ‘merely psychological’
proof.</p>
<p>However, this attempt to eliminate the personal participation of the
logician must leave at each of these points an irreducible residue of
mental operations, on which the operations of the formalized system
itself will continue to rely. (1) The acceptance of a mark on paper as a
symbol implies that (a) we believe that we can identify the mark in
various instances of it and (b) that we know its proper symbolic use. In
both these beliefs we may be mistaken, and they constitute therefore
commitments of our own. (2) In agreeing to regard an aggregate of
symbols as a formula, we accept it as something that can be asserted.
This implies that we believe that such an aggregate says something about
something. We expect to recognize things which satisfy a formula, as
distinct from other things which fail to do so. Since the process by
which our axioms will be satisfied is necessarily left unformalized, our
countenancing of this process constitutes an act of commitment on our
part. (3) The handling of symbols according to mechanical rules cannot
be said to be a proof, unless it carries the conviction that whatever
satisfies the axioms from which the operation starts will also satisfy
the theorems arrived at. No handling of symbols to which we refuse to
award the success of having convinced us that an implication has been
demonstrated can be said to be a proof. And again, this award is an
unformalized process which constitutes a commitment.</p>
<p>Thus, at a number of points, a formal system of symbols and
operations can be said to function as a deductive system only by virtue
of unformalized supplements, to which the operator of the system
accedes: symbols must be identifiable and their meaning known, axioms
must be understood to assert something, proofs must be acknowledged to
demonstrate something, and this identifying, knowing, understanding,
acknowledging, are unformalized operations on which the working of a
formal system depends. We may call them the semantic functions of the
formal system. These are performed by a person with the aid of the
formal system, when the person relies on its use.6</p>
<p>It is, indeed, logically absurd to say of a logical inference machine
that it draws inferences of its own. By itself an inference machine is
merely an ‘inference machine’ and can only draw ‘inferences’. The
omission of the quotation marks expresses our accrediting of the
machine, and hence our acceptance of the conclusions arrived at by its
operations, as our own inferences. The legitimate purpose of
formalization lies in the reduction of the tacit coefficient to more
limited and obvious informal operations; but it is nonsensical to aim at
the total elimination of our personal participation.</p>
<p>This conclusion will be found applicable in this general form to all
kinds of automatic mechanisms. It can be precisely elaborated for the
time being only for the process of logical inferences and for machines
carrying out logical inferences; but this will prove instructive also
for the logical analysis of any kind of automatic machinery used for
intelligent purposes.</p>
<p>The most important theorems limiting the formalization of logical
thought are due to Godel. They are based on the fact that within any
deductive system which includes arithmetic (such as for example the
system of Principia Mathematica) it is possible to construct
formulae—i.e. sentences—which are demonstrably undecidable within that
system, and that such a sentence—the famous Godelian sentence—may say of
itself that it is undecidable within the system. We can then go further
by informally matching the sentence with the situation on which it
bears, that is, with the demonstration of its own undecidability. We
shall now find that what the sentence says is true and decide
accordingly to assert it in that sense. Thus asserted, the sentence
represents an additional axiom, which is independent of the axioms from
which the unasserted sentence was derived.7</p>
<p>This process reveals both that any formal system (of sufficient
richness) is necessarily incomplete and that our personal judgment can
reliably add new axioms to it. It offers a model of conceptual
innovation in the deductive sciences, which illustrates in principle the
inexhaustibility of mathematical heuristics and also the personal and
irreversible character of the acts which continue to draw upon these
possibilities.</p>
<p>Gödel has also shown that the sentence which is demonstrably
undecidable may say that the axioms of the system cannot be proved to be
consistent. This shows (as I have mentioned before) that we never know
altogether what our axioms mean, since if we knew, we could avoid the
possibility of asserting in one axiom what another axiom denies. This
uncertainty can be eliminated for any particular deductive system by
shifting it unto a wider system of axioms, within which we may be able
to prove the consistency of the original system. But any such proof will
still remain uncertain, in the sense that the consistency of the wider
system will always remain undecidable.</p>
<p>In a logical demonstration closely akin to the proof of Gödel’s
theorems, Tarski has shown that any formal system in which we could
assert a sentence and also reflect on the truth of its assertion must be
self-contradictory. Thus, in particular, the assertion that any theorem
of a given formal language is true, can be made only by a sentence that
is meaningless within that language. Such an assertion forms part of a
richer language than that which comprises the sentences whose truth it
asserts.8</p>
<p>The construction of the Godelian sentence shows that a process of
deductive inference can produce a situation which irresistibly suggests
an assertion not formally implied in its premisses. Tarski’s theorem
that the assertion of truth belongs to a logically richer (formal)
language than the (formal) language of the sentences asserted to be
true, shows that the question whether a previously asserted sentence is
true evokes a similar expansion. It arises in both cases from a
reflection on what has been said. In the Godelian process we add to a
formally undecided statement of ours a tacit interpretation of our own.
The act of innovation consists here in realizing that what we had just
said was true in this new sense. The Tarski process is based on the
‘duality’ of asserted sentences; the formal innovation being due here to
our capacity for calling in question a hitherto tacit assent of ours and
renewing our assent in explicit terms. In both processes we establish
something new by an inescapable act of our own, induced—but not
performed—by formal operations.</p>
<p>I have described before (Part Two, ch. 5, p. 131) how the
mathematician works his way towards discovery, by shifting his
confidence from intuition to computation, and back again from
computation to intuition, while never releasing his hold on either of
the two. These shifts are usually gradual. The matching of the Gödelian
sentence with the facts to which it refers and the subsequent
reassertion of the Godelian sentence, determine jointly a precise point
at which tacit thought takes over control for the crossing of a logical
gap.9</p>
<p>We find a similar alternation involved in the method of ‘mathematical
induction’ which Poincare regarded as the prototype of all mathematical
innovations.10 It starts by proving a series of theorems which apply to
successive whole numbers, each consecutive theorem being derived from
the previous one, and proceeds to conclude hence that the theorem is
true generally for all numbers. To draw such inferences the mind must
look back upon a series of demonstrations and generalize the principle
of its own past operations. In Part Two, ch. 6 (p. 185) I have quoted an
account by Daval and Guilbaud, showing how the conception of continuity
was discovered by such a process of reflection.</p>
<p>The analogy between the Gödelian process of innovation and the
grammar of discovery outlined by Poincaré lends support to the
continuity between the informal act of assertion and the equally
informal act of discovery. The difference between the two lies in the
width of the logical gap that is being crossed. The gap to be crossed
for the reassertion of the Godelian sentence is extremely narrow—almost
imperceptible—while in true acts of discovery it may be as large as any
human mind can hope to overcome. The act of assent proves once more to
be logically akin to the act of discovery: they are both essentially
unformalizable, intuitive mental decisions.</p>
