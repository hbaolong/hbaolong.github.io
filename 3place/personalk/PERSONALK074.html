<h4 id="towards-an-epistemology-of-personal-knowledge">7. TOWARDS AN
EPISTEMOLOGY OF PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE</h4>
<p>We have re-defined the word ‘true’ as expressing the asseveration of
the sentence to which it refers. This is closely akin to Tarski’s
definition of ‘true’ which implies, for example: ‘“snow is white” is
true if and only if snow is white’. But Tarski’s definition now appears
to equate a sentence with an action. This anomaly may be eliminated by
revising the definition as follows: ‘I shall say that “snow is white” is
true if and only if I believe that snow is white’. Or perhaps more
reasonably: ‘If I believe snow is white I shall say that “snow is white”
is true’. This expression, admittedly, suggests a difference in emphasis
between asserting a sentence and saying that it is true: the first
stressing the personal character of our knowledge, the second its
universal intent. But they both remain personal endorsements of the
statement.</p>
<p>Earlier on—in the chapter on Probability5—I have denied the
possibility of expressing the act of placing my confidence in a
statement of fact by a statement of the probability of this fact. I
suggested that the act of endorsing a sentence should be indicated in
writing by the prefix ’’ used by Frege as an assertion sign, which
should be read as ‘I believe’, or as some equivalent expression of
endorsement. Such a prefix should not function as a verb, but as a
symbol determining the modality of the sentence. The transposition of an
assertion of fact into the ‘fiduciary mode’ would correctly reflect the
fact that such an assertion is necessarily attributable to a definite
person at a particular place and time: for example, io the writer of the
assertion at the moment of putting it to paper, or to the reader when he
reads and accepts what is written.</p>
<p>This transposition considerably modifies the situation within which
we have to account for making assertions of fact. So long as we ascribed
to declaratory sentences the properties of being true or false, we had
to account for these properties in the same sense as we would explain
what makes green leaves green. Such self-speaking sentences appeared to
possess the quality of being true or false impersonally, and this would
have to be accounted for again in terms of impersonal criteria: which is
of course impossible. We might have a better chance of achieving the
purpose of epistemological reflection if we asked ourselves instead why
we do believe certain statements of fact, or why we believe certain
classes of statements, such as those of science. For having recognized
that an ‘impersonal allegation’ is a contradiction in terms—just as an
‘anonymous cheque’ would be—we shall no longer try to arrive at any
justification of our allegations which would not in its turn be composed
of personal allegations of our own. It should not be too difficult to
justify my scientific beliefs, in particular, in terms of some logically
antecedent beliefs of my own, this justification itself being
acknowledged once more to involve a fiduciary act of my own. The trouble
is in fact that this may appear so easy as to be quite pointless. For it
will be objected that ‘You can believe what you like’; which brings us
back once more to the paradox of self-set standards; if the criteria of
reasonableness, to which I subject my own beliefs, are ultimately upheld
by my confidence in them, the whole process of justifying such beliefs
may appear but a futile authorization of my own authority.</p>
<p>Yet so be it. Only this manner of adopting the fiduciary mode is
consonant with itself: the decision to do so must be admitted to be
itself in the nature of a fiduciary act. Indeed, the same must apply to
the whole of this enquiry and to all conceivable conclusions to be
derived from it. While I shall continue to argue a series of points and
adduce evidence for my proposed conclusions, I shall always wish it to
be understood that in the last resort my statements affirm my personal
beliefs, arrived at by the considerations given in the text in
conjunction with other not specifiable motives of my own. Nothing that I
shall say should claim the kind of objectivity to which in my belief no
reasoning should ever aspire; namely that it proceeds by a strict
process, the acceptance of which by the expositor, and his
recommendation of which for acceptance by others, include no passionate
impulse of his own.</p>
<p>I hope to consolidate this decision later. Meanwhile, I have yet to
face some further dilemmas arising from the objectivist urge to
depersonalize our intelligent mental processes.</p>
