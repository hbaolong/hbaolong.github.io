<h4 id="conception-of-a-generalized-field">5. CONCEPTION OF A
GENERALIZED FIELD</h4>
<p>We can now perceive more clearly the roots of the parallelism between
comprehension and morphogenesis hinted at by Spemann in his Silliman
Lectures.15 Comprehension is an unformalizable process striving towards
an unspecifiable achievement, and is accordingly attributed to the
agency of a centre seeking satisfaction in the light of its own
standards. For it cannot be defined without accrediting the intellectual
satisfaction of the comprehending centre. The unspecifiability of a
conscious act of comprehension implies the impossibility of accounting
for it in terms of a fixed neurological mechanism; and the intellectual
commitment involved in such an act excludes any representation of it in
terms of a physico-chemical equilibration which cannot distinguish
between success and failure. Comprehension and the somatic process which
accompanies comprehension, represent therefore a kind of equilibration
that can be defined only in terms of intellectual rightness.
Morphogenesis, operating under the direction of a morphogenetic field,
is a somatic process of the same kind, but following morphological
rightness as its standard of achievement. Yet it may be described as
equilibration, to distinguish it from the operation of a machine-like
framework, and also to illustrate the inexhaustible resourcefulness
shown by the morphogenetic process. Once it is recognized that this
resourcefulness is mobilized in the service of an achievement which can
be appreciated only in morphological terms, we find that this implies
awarding to it success or failure, by standards which we ourselves set
to the process as being appropriate to itself. The morphogenetic field
(or its organizer, if there is one) is then defined as the agency of
this success and as that which has failed if success is not
achieved.</p>
<p>This situation can be described more precisely by a generalization of
the field concept in a strictly biological sense, purified of any
arrière-pensée of physico-chemical equilibration. All the operations of
the ‘tacit component’ (whether self-centred or seeking universality,
whether conscious or unconscious) will be subsumed under this field
conception. All mental unease that seeks appeasement of itself will be
regarded as a line of force in such a field. Just as mechanical forces
are the gradients of a potential energy, so this field of forces would
also be the gradient of a potentiality: a gradient arising from the
proximity of a possible achievement. Our sense of approaching the
unknown solution of a problem, and the urge to pursue it, are manifestly
responses to a gradient of potential achievement; and when we identify a
morphogenetic field, we see in it in fact a set of events co-ordinated
by a common gradient of achievement. We may recall also that muscular
co-ordination appears likewise unformalizable in terms of any fixed
anatomical machinery, and that the functional stability and recuperation
of the central nervous system after widespread injuries, as well as the
search for lost memories, offer further instances of apparently
unformalizable operations. These again are evidence of fields of forces
derived from various gradients of achievement.</p>
<p>The conception of such a field is of course finalistic. It attributes
to certain achievements—whether self-centred or aiming at
universality—the power to promote their own realization. Scientists will
not be prepared even to consider such a suggestion, unless they have
completely accepted the fact that biotic achievements cannot—logically
cannot—be ever represented in terms of physics and chemistry; and very
few do realize this. Besides, a biologist may reject the assumption that
living beings have peculiar faculties for achieving biotic success, on
the grounds that this would impute to them magical powers which could
explain anything—and hence explain nothing. But this objection would
misunderstand the kind of finalism I suggest here. For though biotic
achievements are said to be unspecifiable, we do claim the capacity for
identifying and appraising them; nor is their scope unlimited or the
range of their resourcefulness unbounded. A biology and a psychology
formulated in terms of achievement can therefore be studied quite
systematically; in fact these sciences are mainly pursued in these very
terms—though heavily disguised—in our own days. Yet, even though a
biologist might recognize this situation, he may prefer not to
acknowledge it, for fear that biology would degenerate to mere
speculation if it abandoned the ideal of becoming a science as objective
as physics and chemistry. For my part, I do not share this apprehension,
and would expect, on the contrary, that biology would gain greatly in
scope and depth by addressing itself more candidly to the fundamental
features of life. In any case, the non-specialist who wishes to find his
way about the world can certainly not accept the prudential policies
imposed by scientific objectivism.</p>
<p>Returning therefore to the outline of generalized biological fields,
we see now that their operations comprise three stages of originality,
of which phylogenetic emergence is the highest. (1) There is the
originality of a resourcefulness manifested in achieving something
clearly foreseeable. This kind of originality was illustrated in my last
chapter, e.g. by the way mutilated rats run a maze known to them from
their previous unmutilated condition. (2) The ontogenetic maturation by
which infants develop the faculty of logical thinking may be classed in
a higher category, as representing a series of achievements, each
producing a new field by which the next higher achievement will be
performed. Such emergence—defined as an ordering principle capable of
producing operational principles which the system had not previously
possessed—has been adequately illustrated by the process of ontogenetic
maturation. (3) Phylogenetic emergence exceeds this degree of
originality by producing operational principles that are altogether
unprecedented, and this fully developed emergence we were able to
approach so far only by forming a continuous transition from ontogenetic
maturation to heuristic achievements. It is on this connection that we
have now to rely further in applying to the process of anthropogenesis a
field theory based on the gradient of achievement.</p>
<p>Though this homology was suggested long ago by Samuel Butler and was
elaborated since by Henri Bergson, it may still appear far-fetched. But
this is partly due to an error in perspective. The highest forms of
originality are far more closely akin to the lowest biotic performances
than the external circumstances would indicate. It is true that creative
human achievements rely on a far flung, highly articulate, cultural
structure, but the creative act itself is performed by informal
comprehensive powers—by powers which the man of genius shares with all
men and which all men share with infants, who in their turn are about on
a par in this matter with the animals. Remember how slight, indeed
almost imperceptible, is the superiority of tacit powers which enables
man to develop the tremendous gift of speech. Consider also that
children under two years can learn lip reading better than most adults,
even though the adult may be highly literate, while the child has to
learn to speak and to lip read all at the same time. Originality is
greatest in youth; it is indeed arguable that children would surpass
adult genius if they could command the intellectual equipment and
possess the emotional experience of maturity.</p>
<p>In any case, it is not so much the suggested explanatory framework,
but the fact of phylogenetic emergence itself that is so astounding; and
this fact, I believe, is indisputable. It is a process of maturation
which differs in the most curious manner from that of ontogenesis; for
it is a maturation of the potentialities of ontogenesis. The
evolutionary process takes place in the germ plasm, but it manifests
itself in the novel organism which the germ plasm potentially embodies.
It occurs in one place and manifests itself in another. Hence if,
contemplating the process of anthropogenesis, we are clearly
convinced—as I am—that this is in fact so, we are driven to assume that
the maturation of the germ plasm is guided by the potentialities that
are open to it through its possible germination into new individuals. We
are actually facing then the operations of a phylogenetic field guiding
anthropogenic maturation along the gradients of phylogenetic
achievement—as clearly as the embryologist faces morphogenetic fields
derived from the gradient of ontogenetic achievement. Nor can we fail
then to note that at least in some cases we can experience such
gradients internally. We know clearly the approach of a recollection for
which we have been racking our memory, and will tend to compare this
with an ontogenetic maturation which re-produces things already achieved
before; while we know also how the search for entirely novel
achievements is guided by intimations of their growing proximity, even
as the possibility of unprecedented achievements guides the maturation
of the germ plasm to ever higher evolutionary stages.</p>
