<h4 id="neurology-and-psychology">10. NEUROLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY</h4>
<p>Neurology is based on the assumption that the nervous
system—functioning automatically according to the known laws of physics
and chemistry—determines all the workings which we normally attribute to
the mind of an individual. The study of psychology shows a parallel
tendency towards reducing its subject matter to explicit relationships
between measurable variables; relationships which could always be
represented by the performances of a mechanical artefact.</p>
<p>This raises the question whether in view of the logical analysis of
‘a machine in use’ we can accept a neurological model (or an analogous
psychological model) as the representation of an individual’s mind. In
answering this question we must take into account an obvious difference
between an automatic neurological model and a machine operated for
intelligent purposes; namely, that the neurological model is not
supposed to operate for purposes of the neurologist, but for purposes
attributed to its operations by the neurologist on behalf of the subject
whose mind it represents. The tripartite system accordingly becomes:</p>
<p>But the informal mental functions briefly indicated under III are
those of the neurologist’s mind, since the informal, and hence personal,
functions of the subject’s mind are in fact not represented at all in
the tripartite system. For the neurological model is—like a
machine—strictly impersonal and can account for none of the
unspecifiable propensities of the subject.</p>
<p>These personal powers include the capacity for understanding a
meaning, for believing a factual statement, for interpreting a mechanism
in relation to its purpose, and on a higher level, for reflecting on
problems and exercising originality in solving them. They include,
indeed, every manner of reaching convictions by an act of personal
judgment. The neurologist exercises these powers to the highest degree
in constructing the neurological model of a man—to whom he denies in
this very act any similar powers. The same is true of a psychologist who
reduces the mental manifestations of man to specifiable relations of
measured quantities, for as such these can always be represented by the
performances of a robot.</p>
<p>This disparity between the powers which the interpreting mind is
confidently exercising in the very act of denying them to the subject
interpreted by it, is justified, so long as the observer is concerned
only with the automatic responses of his subject. When a physiologist
records the reflexes of a person, he is rightly claiming for himself
powers of judgment which are absent in the faculties he is examining in
another person. To the extent to which mental illness deprives those
suffering from it of control over their thoughts, a psychiatrist will
also observe the pathological mechanism in question from the superior
position assumed by him towards his subject.</p>
<p>By contrast, to acknowledge someone as a sane person is to establish
a reciprocal relation to him. By virtue of our own art of comprehension
we experience another person’s similar faculties as the presence of that
person’s mind. Our capacity for knowing things either focally or
subsidiarily is decisive here. Mind is not the aggregate of its focally
known manifestations, but is that on which we focus our attention while
being subsidiarily aware of its manifestations. This is the way (to be
analysed further in Part Four) by which we acknowledge a person’s
judgment and share also other forms of his consciousness. This manner of
knowing a person qualifies him fully for the functions of a mind in
position I of a tripartite system controlled by a mind; while the
aggregate of his focally known manifestations do not qualify him for
these functions.</p>
<p>According to these definitions of ‘mind’ and ‘person’, neither a
machine, nor a neurological model, nor an equivalent robot, can be said
to think, feel, imagine, desire, mean, believe or judge something. They
may conceivably simulate these propensities to such an extent as to
deceive us altogether. But a deception, however compelling, does not
qualify thereby as truth: no amount of subsequent experience can justify
us in accepting as identical two things known from the start to be
different in their nature.12</p>
<p>Our theory of knowledge is now seen to imply an ontology of the mind.
Objectivism requires a specifiably functioning mindless knower. To
accept the indeterminacy of knowledge requires, on the contrary, that we
accredit a person entitled to shape his knowing according to his own
judgment, unspecifiably. This notion—applied to man—implies in its turn
a sociology in which the growth of thought is acknowledged as an
independent force. And such a sociology is a declaration of loyalty to a
society in which truth is respected and human thought is cultivated for
its own sake.13 This ontology—which flows from my theory of
knowledge—will be outlined further in Part Four.</p>
