<h4 id="the-affirmation-of-mathematics">10. THE AFFIRMATION OF
MATHEMATICS</h4>
<p>We have seen that a statement is of value to natural science if it
(1) corresponds to the facts, (2) is relevant to the system of science
and (3) bears on a subject matter which is not without intrinsic
interest; and that a statement is of value in technology (1) if it
reveals an effective and ingenious operational principle which (2)
achieves, in existing circumstances, a substantial material advantage.
Mathematics is a much freer creation than either natural science or
technology. While its early primitive conceptions and operations were no
doubt originally suggested by experience and have served to control the
manipulation of material things, these empirical and practical contacts
do not enter effectively into its present appreciation.</p>
<p>What, then, is mathematics? The ‘grim and inflexible resolve’ of
objectivism has given strange answers to this question. For while we can
attempt to achieve impersonality for natural science by basing it on the
supposed commands of empirical fact, and technology can be grounded in
the requirements of practical life, the only impersonal (or at least
apparently impersonal) justification that is left to mathematical
statements is their freedom from self-contradiction. Accordingly,
mathematics has been described as a set of tautologies.</p>
<p>To this it must be objected in the first place that it is false.
Tautologies are necessarily true, but mathematics is not. We cannot tell
whether the axioms of arithmetic are consistent; and if they are not,
any particular theorem of arithmetic may be false. Therefore these
theorems are not tautologies. They are and must always remain tentative,
while a tautology is an incontrovertible truism.</p>
<p>But even supposing mathematics were wholly consistent, the criterion
of consistency, which the ‘tautology’ doctrine is intended to support,
would still be ludicrously inadequate for defining mathematics. One
might as well regard a machine which goes on printing letters and
typographical signs at random as producing the text of all future
scientific discoveries, poems, laws, speeches, editorials, etc. For just
as only a tiny fraction of true statements about matters of fact
constitute science and only a tiny fraction of conceivable operational
principles constitute technology, so also only a tiny fraction of
statements believed to be consistent constitute mathematics. Mathematics
cannot be properly defined without appeal to the principle which
distinguishes this tiny fraction from the overwhelmingly predominant
aggregate of other non-self-contradictory statements.</p>
<p>We may try to supply this criterion by defining mathematics as the
totality of theorems derived from a certain set of axioms according to
certain operations which will assure their self-consistency, provided
the axioms themselves are mutually consistent. But this is still
inadequate. First, because it leaves completely unaccounted for the
choice of axioms, which hence must appear arbitrary—which it is not;
second, because not all mathematics considered to be well established
has ever been completely formalized according to strict procedure; and
third, because—as K. R. Popper has pointed out—among the propositions
that can be derived from some accepted set of axioms there are still,
for every single one that represents a significant mathematical theorem,
an infinite number that are trivial.71</p>
<p>All these difficulties are but consequences of our refusal to see
that mathematics cannot be defined without acknowledging its most
obvious feature: namely, that it is interesting. Nowhere is intellectual
beauty so deeply felt and fastidiously appreciated in its various grades
and qualities as in mathematics, and only the informal appreciation of
mathematical value can distinguish what is mathematics from a welter of
formally similar, yet altogether trivial statements and operations. And
we shall see that this emotional colour of mathematics also justifies
its acceptance as true. It is by satisfying his intellectual passions
that mathematics fascinates the mathematician and compels him to pursue
it in his thoughts and give it his assent.</p>
<p>I have said earlier on72 that we can understand mathematics only by
our tacit Contribution to its formalism. I have shown how all the proofs
and theorems of mathematics have been originally discovered by relying
on their intuitive anticipation; how the established results of such
discoveries are properly taught, understood, remembered in the form of
their intuitively grasped outline; how these results are effectively
reapplied and developed further by pondering their intuitive content;
and that they can therefore gain our legitimate assent only in terms of
our intuitive approval. I have indeed shown that all articulation
depends on a tacit component of the same kind for conveying a meaning
accredited by the person uttering it. And also that this
comprehension-cum-affirmation is continuous with the active principle of
animal life by which we both shape and accept our knowledge at all its
levels, down to that of drives, motoricity and perception, with which as
animals we are equipped by nature.</p>
<p>The inarticulate coefficient by which we understand and assent to
mathematics is an active principle of this kind; it is a passion for
intellectual beauty. It is on account of its intellectual beauty, which
his own passion proclaims as revealing a universal truth, that the
mathematician feels compelled to accept mathematics as true, even though
he is today deprived of the belief in its logical necessity and doomed
to admit forever the conceivable possibility that its whole fabric may
suddenly collapse by revealing a decisive self-contradiction. And it is
the same urge to see sense and make sense that supports his tacit
bridging of the logical gaps internal to every formal proof.</p>
<p>There is in fact ample evidence that such intellectual passions are
intrinsic to the affirmation of mathematics. Modern mathematics has
emerged from a long series of conceptual reforms tending towards greater
generality and rigour, as well as from more radical conceptual
inventions opening up altogether new perspectives. The acceptance of
such conceptual innovations is a self-modifying mental act in search of
a truer intellectual life. It has been authoritatively stated that ‘the
moments of greatest creative advancement in science frequently coincide
with the introduction of new notions by means of a definition’.73 This
can be true only because the acceptance of a new conception, even when
it is specified by a definition, is ultimately an informal act: a
transformation of the framework on which we rely in the process of
formal reasoning. It is the crossing of a logical gap to another shore,
where we shall never again see things as we did before. To the extent,
therefore, to which mathematics is the accumulated product of past
conceptual innovations, our affirmation of mathematics is likewise an
irreversible, informal act.</p>
<p>Such an act can be said to be rational if it satisfies our standards
of excellence, and the intellectual beauty of mathematics, upheld by the
passionate connoisseurship of mathematicians, is such a standard.
Accordingly, fundamental progress in mathematics, involving conceptual
reform, is found to be guided by a search for beauty.74 The position
appears essentially the same as in mathematical physics; intellectual
beauty is recognized as a token of a hidden reality. But while in the
natural sciences the feeling of making contact with reality is an augury
of as yet undreamed future empirical confirmations of an imminent
discovery, in mathematics it betokens an indeterminate range of future
germinations within mathematics itself.</p>
<p>Since the convincing power of a mathematical proof operates through
our tacit understanding of it, the acceptance of a proof may also
involve radical conceptual innovations. ‘There are beautiful theorems in
the “theory of aggregates” (Mengenlehre) such as Cantor’s theorem of the
“non enumerability” of the continuum’, writes G. H. Hardy, ‘the proof
〔of which〕 is easy enough once the language has been mastered, but
considerable explanation is necessary before the meaning of the theorem
becomes clear.’75 Cantor’s proofs traversed a logical gap across which
only those willing to enter into their meaning and capable of grasping
it could follow him. Reluctance or incapacity to do so caused divisions
among mathematicians, similar to those which arose between van’t Hoff
and Kolbe on the subject of the asymmetric carbon atom, or between
Pasteur and Liebig on that of fermentation as a vital function of yeast.
Hadamard describes how he and the great Lebesgue, finding themselves on
opposite sides of this dispute, were compelled to recognize the
impossibility of understanding each other. ‘We could not avoid the
conclusion that what is evident—the very starting point of certitude in
every domain of thought—had not the same meaning for him and for me.’76
The fundamental conceptual changes involved in Cantor’s work were so
repulsive to Kroneker, who dominated German mathematics in the 1880’s,
that he barred Cantor from promotion in all German universities and even
from having his papers published in any German mathematical journal.77
Hadamard confesses that in another field of great modern discoveries,
the theory of groups, ‘though being eventually able to use it for simple
applications, he met with insuperable difficulty in mastering more than
a rather elementary and superficial knowledge of it’.78 Some important
innovations have, admittedly, been established by proofs requiring no
such far-reaching conceptual adaptation. But even so, their intellectual
excellence has contributed to the consolidation of the fundamental
conceptions on which their success was based.</p>
