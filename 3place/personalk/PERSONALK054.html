<h4 id="transmission-of-social-lore">3. TRANSMISSION OF SOCIAL LORE</h4>
<p>The combined action of authority and trust which underlies both the
learning of language and its use for carrying messages, is a simplified
instance of a process which enters into the whole transmission of
culture to succeeding generations.</p>
<p>Our modern culture is highly articulate. If another Flood came over
us, the largest liner afloat would not suffice to carry the millions of
volumes, the many thousands of paintings and hundreds of different
instruments, musical, scientific and technical, together with the host
of specialists uniquely qualified to use these means of articulation, by
which we might transmit to post-diluvian humanity even the crudest
remains of our civilization. The current transmission of this immense
aggregate of intellectual artefacts from one generation to another takes
place by a process of communication which flows from adults to young
people. This kind of communication can be received only when one person
places an exceptional degree of confidence in another, the apprentice in
the master, the student in the teacher, and popular audiences in
distinguished speakers or famous writers. This assimilation of great
systems of articulate lore by novices of various grades is made possible
only by a previous act of affiliation, by which the novice accepts
apprenticeship to a community which cultivates this lore, appreciates
its values and strives to act by its standards. This affiliation begins
with the fact that a child submits to education within a community, and
it is confirmed throughout life to the extent to which the adult
continues to place exceptional confidence in the intellectual leaders of
the same community. Just as children learn to speak by assuming that the
words used in their presence mean something, so throughout the whole
range of cultural apprenticeship the intellectual junior’s craving to
understand the doings and sayings of his intellectual superiors assumes
that what they are doing and saying has a hidden meaning which, when
discovered, will be found satisfying to some extent.</p>
<p>I have spoken before of heuristic intimations in problem-solving and
shown their kinship with the learner’s anticipation that what he tries
to understand is in fact reasonable. The learner, like the discoverer,
must believe before he can know. But while the problem-solver’s
foreknowledge expresses confidence in himself, the intimations followed
by the learner are based predominantly on his confidence in others; and
this is an acceptance of authority.</p>
<p>Such granting of one’s personal allegiance is—like an act of
heuristic conjecture—a passionate pouring of oneself into untried forms
of existence. The continued transmission of articulate systems, which
lends public and enduring quality to our intellectual gratifications,
depends throughout on these acts of submission.8</p>
<p>These self-modifying processes are inherently informal, irreversible
and to this extent a-critical. Admittedly, once discovery is achieved or
the learner has mastered his subject, the conjectural tension is
reduced: the discoverer can then demonstrate his result and the learner
can justify the knowledge he has acquired. But the amount of knowledge
which we can justify from evidence directly available to us can never be
large. The overwhelming proportion of our factual beliefs continue
therefore to be held at second hand through trusting others, and in the
great majority of cases our trust is placed in the authority of
comparatively few people of widely acknowledged standing.</p>
<p>Moreover, what is true of the acquisition of knowledge applies
likewise to all other intellectual satisfactions. The current
cultivation of thought in society depends throughout on the same kind of
personal confidence which secures the transmission of social lore from
one generation to the next. I shall go into this presently in detail
when describing the administration of culture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have yet to add an essential qualification to the
principle of authority. Every acceptance of authority is qualified by
some measure of reaction to it or even against it. Submission to a
consensus is always accompanied to some extent by the imposition of
one’s views on the consensus to which we submit. Every time we use a
word in speaking and writing we both comply with usage and at the same
time somewhat modify the existing usage; every time I select a programme
on the radio I modify a little the balance of current cultural
valuations; even when I make my purchase at current prices I slightly
modify the whole price system. Indeed, whenever I submit to a current
consensus, I inevitably modify its teaching; for I submit to what I
myself think it teaches and by joining the consensus on these terms I
affect its content. On the other hand, even the sharpest dissent still
operates by partial submission to an existing consensus: for the
revolutionary must speak in terms that people can understand. Moreover,
every dissenter is a teacher. The figures of Antigone and of the
Socrates of the Apology are monuments of the dissenter as lawgiver. So
are also the prophets of the Old Testament—and so is a Luther, or a
Calvin. All modern revolutionaries since the Jacobins demonstrate
likewise that dissent does not seek to abolish public authority, but to
claim it for itself.</p>
<p>Admittedly, submission to authority is in general less deliberately
assertive than is an act of dissent. But not always. St. Augustine’s
struggle for belief in revelation was much more dynamic and original
than is the rejection of revelation by a religiously brought up young
man today. In any case, at every step of the process by which we are
brought up and continue to participate in an established consensus, we
exercise some measure of choice between different degrees of conformity
and dissent, and either of these choices may mean a more passive or a
more assertive reaction.</p>
<p>We should realize at the same time how inevitable, and how unceasing
and comprehensive are such accreditive decisions. I cannot speak of a
scientific fact, of a word, of a poem or a boxing champion; of last
week’s murder or the Queen of England; of money or music or the fashion
in hats, of what is just or unjust, trivial, amusing, boring or
scandalous, without implying a reference to a consensus by which these
matters are acknowledged—or denied to be—what I declare them to be. I
must continually endorse the existing consensus or dissent from it to
some degree, and in either case I express what I believe the consensus
ought to be in respect to whatever I speak of. The present text, in
which I have described in my own way the interaction of every utterance
with the public consensus, is no exception to what I have said in the
text about utterances of this kind. Throughout this book I am affirming
my own beliefs, and more particularly so when I insist, as I do here,
that such personal affirmations and choices are inescapable, and, when I
argue, as I shall do, that this is all that can be required of me.</p>
