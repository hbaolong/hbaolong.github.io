<h4 id="the-lesson-of-the-copernican-revolution">1. THE LESSON OF THE
COPERNICAN REVOLUTION</h4>
<p>IN the <em>Ptolemaic</em> system, as in the <em>cosmogony</em> of the
Bible, man was assigned a central position in the universe, from which
position he was ousted by Copernicus. Ever since, writers eager to drive
the lesson home have urged us, resolutely and repeatedly, to abandon all
sentimental egoism, and to see ourselves objectively in the true
perspective of time and space. What precisely does this mean? In a full
‘main feature’ film, recapitulating faithfully the complete history of
the universe, the rise of human beings from the first beginnings of man
to the achievements of the twentieth century would flash by in a single
second. Alternatively, if we decided to examine the universe objectively
in the sense of paying equal attention to portions of equal mass, this
would result in a lifelong preoccupation with interstellar dust,
relieved only at brief intervals by a survey of incandescent masses of
hydrogen—not in a thousand million lifetimes would the turn come to give
man even a second’s notice. It goes without saying that no
one—scientists included—looks at the universe this way, whatever
lip-service is given to ‘objectivity’. Nor should this surprise us. For,
as human beings, we must inevitably see the universe from a centre lying
within ourselves and speak about it in terms of a human language shaped
by the exigencies of human intercourse. Any attempt rigorously to
eliminate our human perspective from our picture of the world must lead
to absurdity.</p>
<p>What is the true lesson of the Copernican revolution? Why did
Copernicus exchange his actual terrestrial station for an imaginary
solar standpoint? The only justification for this lay in the greater
intellectual satisfaction he derived from the celestial panorama as seen
from the sun instead of the earth. Copernicus gave preference to man’s
delight in abstract theory, at the price of rejecting the evidence of
our senses, which present us with the irresistible fact of the sun, the
moon, and the stars rising daily in the east to travel across the sky
towards their setting in the west. In a literal sense, therefore, the
new Copernican system was as anthropocentric as the Ptolemaic view, the
difference being merely that it preferred to satisfy a different human
affection.</p>
<p>It becomes legitimate to regard the Copernican system as more
objective than the Ptolemaic only if we accept this very shift in the
nature of intellectual satisfaction as the criterion of greater
objectivity. This would imply that, of two forms of knowledge, we should
consider as more objective that which relies to a greater measure on
theory rather than on more immediate sensory experience. So that, the
theory being placed like a screen between our senses and the things of
which our senses otherwise would have gained a more immediate
impression, we would rely increasingly on theoretical guidance for the
interpretation of our experience, and would correspondingly reduce the
status of our raw impressions to that of dubious and possibly misleading
appearances.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we have sound reasons for thus considering
theoretical knowledge as more objective than immediate experience.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>A theory is something other than myself. It may be set out on
paper as a system of rules, and it is the more truly a theory the more
completely it can be put down in such terms. Mathematical theory reaches
the highest perfection in this respect. But even a geographical map
fully embodies in itself a set of strict rules for finding one’s way
through a region of otherwise uncharted experience. Indeed, all theory
may be regarded as a kind of map extended over space and time. It seems
obvious that a map can be correct or mistaken, so that to the extent to
which I have relied on my map I shall attribute to it any mistakes that
I made by doing so. A theory on which I rely is therefore objective
knowledge in so far as it is not I, but the theory, which is proved
right or wrong when I use such knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>A theory, moreover, cannot be led astray by my personal
illusions. To find my way by a map I must perform the conscious act of
map-reading and I may be deluded in the process, but the map cannot be
deluded and remains right or wrong in itself, impersonally.
Consequently, a theory on which I rely as part of my knowledge remains
unaffected by any fluctuations occurring within myself. It has a rigid
formal structure, on whose steadfastness I can depend whatever mood or
desire may possess me.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the formal affirmations of a theory are unaffected by the
state of the person accepting it, theories may be constructed without
regard to one’s normal approach to experience. This is a third reason
why the Copernican system, being more theoretical than the Ptolemaic, is
also more objective. Since its picture of the solar system disregards
our terrestrial location, it equally commends itself to the inhabitants
of Earth, Mars, Venus, or Neptune, provided they share our intellectual
values.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, when we claim greater objectivity for the Copernican theory, we
do imply that its excellence is, not a matter of personal taste on our
part, but an inherent quality deserving universal acceptance by rational
creatures. We abandon the cruder anthropocentrism of our senses—but only
in favour of a more ambitious anthropocentrism of our reason. In doing
so, we claim the capacity to formulate ideas which command respect in
their own right, by their very rationality, and which have in this sense
an objective standing.</p>
<p>Actually, the theory that the planets move round the sun was to speak
for itself in a fashion that went far beyond asserting its own inherent
rationality. It was to speak to Kepler (sixty-six years after the death
of Copernicus) and inspire his discovery of the elliptic path of planets
and of their constant angular surface velocity; and to inspire again,
ten years later, his discovery of the Third Law of planetary motion,
relating orbital distances to orbital periods. And another sixty-eight
years later, Newton was to announce to the world that these laws were
but an expression of the underlying fact of general gravitation. The
intellectual satisfaction which the heliocentric system originally
provided, and which gained acceptance for it, proved to be the token of
a deeper significance unknown to its originator. Unknown but not
entirely unsuspected; for those who wholeheartedly embraced the
Copernican system at an early stage committed themselves thereby to the
expectation of an indefinite range of possible future confirmations of
the theory, and this expectation was essential to their belief in the
superior rationality and objective validity of the system.</p>
<p>One may say, indeed, quite generally, that a theory which we acclaim
as rational in itself is thereby accredited with prophetic powers. We
accept it in the hope of making contact with reality; so that, being
really true, our theory may yet show forth its truth through future
centuries in ways undreamed of by its authors. Some of the greatest
scientific discoveries of our age have been rightly described as the
amazing confirmations of accepted scientific theories. In this wholly
indeterminate scope of its true implications lies the deepest sense in
which objectivity is attributed to a scientific theory.</p>
<p>Here, then, are the true characteristics of objectivity as
exemplified by the Copernican theory. Objectivity does not demand that
we estimate man’s significance in the universe by the minute size of his
body, by the brevity of his past history or his probable future career.
It does not require that we see ourselves as a mere grain of sand in a
million Saharas. It inspires us, on the contrary, with the hope of
overcoming the appalling disabilities of our bodily existence, even to
the point of conceiving a rational idea of the universe which can
authoritatively speak for itself. It is not a counsel of
self-effacement, but the very reverse—a call to the Pygmalion in the
mind of man.</p>
<p>This is not, however, what we are taught today. To say that the
discovery of objective truth in science consists in the apprehension of
a rationality which commands our respect and arouses our contemplative
admiration; that such discovery, while using the experience of our
senses as clues, transcends this experience by embracing the vision of a
reality beyond the impressions of our senses, a vision which speaks for
itself in guiding us to an ever deeper understanding of reality—such an
account of scientific procedure would be generally shrugged aside as
out-dated Platonism: a piece of mystery-mongering unworthy of an
enlightened age. Yet it is precisely on this conception of objectivity
that I wish to insist in this introductory chapter. I want to recall how
scientific theory came to be reduced in the modern mind to the rank of a
convenient contrivance, a device for recording events and computing
their future course, and I wish to suggest then that twentieth-century
physics, and Einstein’s discovery of relativity in particular, which are
usually regarded as the fruits and illustrations of this positivistic
conception of science, demonstrate on the contrary the power of science
to make contact with reality in nature by recognizing what is rational
in nature.</p>
