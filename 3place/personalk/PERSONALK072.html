<h4 id="the-personal-mode-of-meaning">5. THE PERSONAL MODE OF
MEANING</h4>
<p>If, then, it is not words that have meaning, but the speaker or
listener who means something by them, let me declare accordingly my true
position as the author of what I have written so far, as well as of what
is still to follow. I must admit now that I did not start the present
reconsideration of my beliefs with a clean slate of unbelief. Far from
it. I started as a person intellectually fashioned by a particular
idiom, acquired through my affiliation to a civilization that prevailed
in the places where I had grown up, at this particular period of
history. This has been the matrix of all my intellectual efforts. Within
it I was to find my problem and seek the terms for its solution. All my
amendments to these original terms will remain embedded in the system of
my previous beliefs. Worse still, I cannot precisely say what these
beliefs are. I can say nothing precisely. The words I have spoken and am
yet to speak mean nothing: it is only I who mean something by them. And,
as a rule, I do not focally know what I mean, and though I could explore
my meaning up to a point, I believe that my words (descriptive words)
must mean more than I shall ever know, if they are to mean anything at
all.</p>
<p>This prospect may sound deplorable, but a programme that accepts it
may at least claim to be self-consistent, while any philosophy that sets
up strictness of meaning as its ideal is self-contradictory. For if the
active participation of the philosopher in meaning what he says is
regarded by it as a defect which precludes the achievement of objective
validity, it must reject itself by these standards. Nor is the
consistency of an objectivist philosophy restored by confessing that
words have an open texture. For such words, as we have seen (p. 113),
have no meaning except through our accrediting of the speaker’s sense of
fitness. Therefore, without the explicit acknowledgment and endorsement
of the philosopher’s personal judgment as an integral part of his
philosophy, a philosophy expressed in terms of ‘open texture’ is also
meaningless.</p>
<p>While impersonal meaning is self-contradictory, the justification of
personal meaning is self-justifying, if only it admits its own personal
character. It licenses certain conditions of articulation which are
bound to become apparent when we reflect on this process of licensing,
but which cannot be held to invalidate it, since they should be
acceptable in the very light of this licensing. If I agree that every
word I confidently utter as meaningful is so uttered as a personal
commitment of my own, then I may agree also that the words used for
making this statement itself are similarly employed to mean what I
myself mean by them. Thus if I cannot speak except from inside a
language, I may at least speak of my language in a manner consistent
with this situation.</p>
<p>But consistency is not enough. There must also be some significance
left in my programme. Can I ever justify saying anything at all, if the
moment I start speaking I am accrediting the indefinitely ramified
implications of a particular vocabulary, and any subsequent
justification of these implications would still be necessarily couched
in the very idioms which I seek to justify? It might seem that we have
saved the concept of meaning from destruction by depersonalization, only
to expose it to being reduced to the status of dogmatic
subjectivity.</p>
<p>Here I must leave my enquiry temporarily suspended. For the
justification of the personal mode of meaning as described in this
section can be attempted only later, in conjunction with the kindred
problems arising from the fiduciary mode of assertion.</p>
