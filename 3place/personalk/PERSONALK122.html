<h4 id="the-emergence-of-machine-like-operations">6. THE EMERGENCE OF
MACHINE-LIKE OPERATIONS</h4>
<p>My survey of anthropogenesis has stressed the rise of sentience and
personhood, and it is this spectacle that has guided so far my
observations on evolution. I have hardly mentioned the elaborate
structural and functional innovations which have led to the formation of
the higher animals, though the emergence of these ingenious
instruments—precisely performing most delicate operations—has been the
principal problem of evolutionary theories in the past. I have done this
because I believe that the unformalizable regulative functions, linked
to the animal’s mental processes, are the predominant, comprehensive
agency of animal life. The evolution of personhood clearly produces
novel centres of being, and this fact must be fully envisaged before we
approach the evolution of anatomic and physiological equipments which,
viewed in themselves, might appear merely as new implements serving
unchanged centres. And not unless we first recognize that evolution can
give rise to ever new unformalizable operations only by acting, itself,
as an unformalizable principle, shall we be prepared to acknowledge also
that new machine-like operations can likewise emerge only in the same
unformalizable manner. Even so, I shall not be able to carry out this
argument here fully. However, having established, in my opinion, that
the evolution of human personhood could only have been actuated by a
maturation of the germ plasm, I feel that the question whether a similar
maturation is also involved in the phylogenesis of machine-like biotic
structures has been reduced to a side issue of my enquiry. Hence I shall
merely outline here the relevant argument, quite briefly.</p>
<p>A machine-like function is characterized by its operational
principle, which cannot be defined in terms of physics and chemistry,
and consequently the rise of new operational principles in living things
cannot be defined either in terms of physics and chemistry. In so far,
therefore, as an organism sustains itself by functioning as a machine,
it is the embodiment of an ordering principle that cannot be defined in
terms of physics and chemistry. Random impacts can release the functions
of an ordering principle and suitable physico-chemical conditions can
sustain its continued operation; but the action which generates the
embodiment of a novel ordering principle always lies in this principle
itself.</p>
<p>I have said all this before. I would now have to defend against
various possible objections my view that this argument applies to the
cases in point—for example to the evolution of lungs and pulmonary
breathing. The question would arise then whether the lungs of one
individual at different ages, as well as of members of different
species, particularly when descended from the same lung-breathing
ancestry, are in fact to be accepted as widely different embodiments of
the same structural and functional principles. And if this be admitted,
I would have to discriminate between such a rational structure and
function actively used by an animal, and the kind of passive advantage
secured to some animals by a protective colouring. I would then urge (as
I have done before) that, since protective colouring is not an
operational principle, it could be established by random mutation plus
natural selection, by which the emergence of a new operational principle
can be released but never established. I suppose that intermediate cases
would have to be considered too, such as, e.g., the emergence of new
habits by which an animal increases the advantage afforded to it by
protective colouring. The distinction to be drawn here might prove
difficult, in the same way as, for example, that between meaningless
learning taking place by accident, and intelligent learning achieved by
understanding. But once the latter form of emergence was fully
established, it would be clear that it represented the achievement of a
new way of life, induced in the germ plasm by a field based on the
gradient of phylogenetic achievement.</p>
<p>I believe that this argument would show that all attempts at
explaining the evolution of complex organs by chance variations in
certain chemical bonds of the germ plasm must fail. But I must admit
once more that I would not feel so certain of this, had I not before me
the rise of human personhood, which manifestly demands the assumption of
finalistic principles of evolution. I shall be satisfied, therefore, to
rest my case for the acknowledgment of the principles in question on the
argument dealing with the emergence of sentience and personhood.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>FIRST CAUSES AND ULTIMATE ENDS</li>
</ol>
<p>In the chapter on Probability I postulated that random impacts could
produce biotic achievements only by releasing the operations of an
ordering principle, and I suggested that the stability of open systems
was a pointer towards the existence of ordering forces of this kind. The
stability of living beings, and the even greater stability of the germ
plasm carried by living beings—which can all be classed as open
systems—added colour to this suggestion. I confronted this idea then
with the spectacle of the ontogenesis and evolution of a human person,
which I acknowledged as achievements of the highest order; and I
appealed further to the evidence provided by various branches of biology
(including psychology) which seem to cry out for the acknowledgment of a
field as the agent of biotic performances. So, finally, I was led to the
belief stated in the last two sections, that the pathways of biotic
achievements have dynamic properties analogous to those of pathways
along which the potential energy of a system decreases. An
anthropogenesis induced by random mutations would then be essentially on
a par with the ordering of a set of biassed dice under the impact of
Brownian motion at low temperatures.</p>
<p>But again (as in the analysis of maturation) we must remember here
the decisive fact that biotic achievements are those of an active
centre. This completely transforms the picture at the upper levels where
centres are called upon to exercise responsible choices—and continuity
demands that we should take this active component into account likewise
down to the lowest levels. The emergence of man and of the thoughts of
man must, therefore, never be regarded as due to a passive shifting of
matter and mind in a field of biotic achievement: it reflects the
gradual rise of autonomous centres of decision.16</p>
<p>Of these decisions we know from experience those of the human mind,
in addition to which we have also observations of the strain imposed by
heuristic decisions on animals. Let me recall the characteristic
features of such acts that are now to be reformulated in the light of
the field conception.</p>
<p>I shall limit myself in the first place to acts of knowing which are
the principal subjects of this book. Subjective knowing is classed as
passive; only knowing that bears on reality is active, personal, and
rightly to be called objective. It is for me, who use these terms
confidently, to declare ultimately what knowing I believe to bear on
objective reality, and this qualification is included in the foregoing
definition of objective knowing. Let me now introduce the concept of a
heuristic field. We assume that the gradient of a discovery, measured by
the nearness of discovery prompts the mind towards it. This was implied
already in the chapter on Intellectual Passions, but not yet explicitly
stated there. The assumption of a heuristic field explains now how it is
possible that we acquire knowledge and believe that we can hold it,
though we can do this only on evidence which cannot justify these acts
by any acceptable strict rules. It suggests that we may do so because an
innate affinity for making contact with reality moves our thoughts—under
the guidance of useful clues and plausible rules—to increase ever
further our hold on reality.</p>
<p>Taken literally, however, this picture would be misleading, since it
once more describes the movement of the mind as a passive event. The
lines of force in a heuristic field should stand for an access to an
opportunity, and for the obligation and the resolve to make good this
opportunity, in spite of its inherent uncertainties. It is true that the
assumption of such a field expresses more clearly than has been done
before that our expectation to discover the truth is justified by our
nature as living beings. It asserts the fact that knowing belongs to the
class of achievements that are comprised by all forms of living, simply
because every manifestation of life is a technical achievement, and is
therefore—like the practice of technology—an applied knowledge of
nature.17 But in order to express correctly this kinship of knowing and
living, fields must be interpreted throughout biology in accordance with
their finalistic character, as fields of opportunity and of a striving
directed towards this opportunity. Biological fields normally belong to
a centre to which both the opportunities and the strivings are
attributable. Though these strivings are continuous with the conscious
strivings of higher animals, they are, of course, in general, neither
conscious nor deliberate. By contrast to a field of forces operating on
an inanimate system, a field of biological striving stands defined by
the fact that we attribute its operations to an active centre, and
acknowledge these operations as the successes or failures of this
centre, while basing our awards of success or failure on criteria which
are largely unspecifiable. In my description of anthropogenesis I have
surveyed the gradual rise of field centres to the rank of full
personhood, and I have again spoken of this rise when illustrating some
aspects of emergence by the logical maturation of the mind from infancy
to adulthood. At all levels of life it is these centres which take the
risks of living and believing. And it is still such centres which, at
the highest stage of development, actuate those men who seek the truth
and declare it to all comers—at all costs.</p>
<p>The point is reached here at which the observer’s appraisal of
biological achievement turns into his submission to the leadership of
superior minds. This corresponds to the extrapolation of biology into
ultra-biology, where the appraisal of living beings merges into an
acknowledgment of the ideals transmitted by our intellectual heritage.
This is the point at which the theory of evolution finally bursts
through the bounds of natural science and becomes entirely an
affirmation of man’s ultimate aims. For the emergent noosphere is wholly
determined as that which we believe to be true and right; it is the
external pole of our commitments, the service of which is our freedom.
It defines a free society as a fellowship fostering truth and respecting
the right. It comprises everything in which we may be totally
mistaken.</p>
<p>Looking back from this point on the immensities of the past, we
realize that all that we see there, throughout the universe, is shaped
by what we now ultimately believe. We see primordial inanimate matter,
the motions of which are determined—whether mechanically or
statistically—by intrinsic fields of forces. We see its particles
settling down into orderly configurations which our physical theories
can trace back (however imperfectly) to the fundamental properties of
inanimate matter. This universe is still dead, but it already has the
capacity of coming to life.</p>
<p>Can we see then all the works of the human mind invisibly inscribed
already in the configuration of primeval incandescent gases? No, we
cannot; for the capacity of coming to life is due to the power of a
field to consolidate centres of first causes. Each such centre bears a
possibility of achievement which, however limited, uncertain, and
unspecifiable in its outcome, characterizes this centre as an
essentially new and autonomous prime mover. The centres of individual
beings are short lived, but the centres of the phylogenetic fields of
which individuals are offshoots go on operating through millions of
years; indeed, some of these may endure for ever—we cannot tell. But we
do know that the phylogenetic centres which formed our own primeval
ancestry have now produced—by a deployment which, when compared with the
long ages of life on earth, looks like a single sudden outburst—a life
of the mind which claims to be guided by universal standards. By this
act a prime cause emergent in time has directed itself at aims that are
timeless.</p>
<p>So far as we know, the tiny fragments of the universe embodied in man
are the only centres of thought and responsibility in the visible world.
If that be so, the appearance of the human mind has been so far the
ultimate stage in the awakening of the world; and all that has gone
before, the strivings of a myriad centres that have taken the risks of
living and believing, seem to have all been pursuing, along rival lines,
the aim now achieved by us up to this point. They are all akin to us.
For all these centres—those which led up to our own existence and the
far more numerous others which produced different lines of which many
are extinct—may be seen engaged in the same endeavour towards ultimate
liberation. We may envisage then a cosmic field which called forth all
these centres by offering them a short-lived, limited, hazardous
opportunity for making some progress of their own towards an unthinkable
consummation. And that is also, I believe, how a Christian is placed
when worshipping God.</p>

<li><p>Karl Polanyi became internationally recognized as a pioneer in
economic history following publication of The Great Transformation in
1944. Here he argued that the free-market system had come into existence
under special historical and political circumstances in Great Britain
and could not endure. A good introduction is Joseph E. Stiglitz’s
foreword to The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins
of our Time, 2nd ed., by Karl Polanyi (Boston: Beacon Press, 2001):
vii–xvii.</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, Polanyi disagreed with the aims of the movements
known as Social Relations of Science and Scientists for Social
Responsibility, both associated with the physicist John Desmond Bernal’s
views that became known as Bernalism. See J. D. Bernal, The Social
Function of Science (London: G. Routledge, 1939) and Michael Polanyi’s

<li><p>In his preface to The Logic of Scientific Discovery, Popper
sarcastically rejected “obscurantist faith in the expert’s special skill
and in his personal knowledge and authority; a faith that so well fits
our ‘post-rationalist’ and ‘post-critical’ age” (p. xxvi in the 2002
Routledge Classics edition). For some insights into Polanyi and Popper,
see Struan Jacobs and Phil Mullins, “Relations between Karl Popper and
Michael Polanyi,” Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science 42,
no. 3 (2011): 426–35. Among Polanyi scholars, there has been debate
about intellectual debts that the younger Kuhn may have owed Polanyi,
e.g. as summarized in Martin X. Moleski, SJ, “Polanyi vs. Kuhn:
Worldviews Apart,” Tradition and Discovery 33, no. 2 (2006–7): 7–24; and
Struan Jacobs, “Michael Polanyi and Thomas Kuhn: Priority and Credit,”
Tradition and Discovery 33, no. 2 (2006–7): 25–36.</p></li>

<li><p>An early book on Polanyi’s thought written from a theological
perspective is Richard Gelwick, The Way of Discovery: An Introduction to
the Thought of Michael Polanyi (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977).
Scholars of educational theory include Jeffrey Kane, Beyond Empiricism:
Michael Polanyi Reconsidered (New York: P. Lang, 1984) and, with
philosophical analysis, Stefania Ruzsits Jha, Reconsidering Michael
Polanyi’s Philosophy (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2002).
James MacLean’s Rethinking Law as Process: Creativity, Novelty, Change
(New York: Routlege, 2012) is an example of a recent book with a
discussion of Polanyi and legal thinking.</p></li>
