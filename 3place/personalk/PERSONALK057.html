<h4 id="two-kinds-of-culture">6. TWO KINDS OF CULTURE</h4>
<p>The principal purpose of this book is to achieve a frame of mind in
which I may hold firmly to what I believe to be true, even though I know
that it might conceivably be false. The cultivation of thought in
general is only examined as the context in which truth may be upheld.
Yet I shall now have to include explicitly the domains of morality,
custom and law within the system of culture.</p>
<p>Moral judgments are appraisals and as such are akin to intellectual
valuations. The thirst for righteousness has the same capacity for
satisfying itself by enriching the world that is proper to intellectual
passions. And like the artist and scientist, moral man strives to
satisfy his own standards, to which he attributes universal
validity.</p>
<p>But moral judgments cut much deeper than intellectual valuations. A
man may be consumed by an intellectual passion; he may be a man of
genius, yet be also sycophantic, vain, envious and spiteful. Though a
prince of letters, he would be a despicable person. For men are valued
as men according to their moral force; and the outcome of our moral
striving is assessed, not as the success or failure of any external
performance of ours, but by its effect on our whole person. Accordingly,
moral rules control our whole selves rather than the exercise of our
faculties, and to comply with a code of morality, custom and law, is to
live by it in a far more comprehensive sense than is involved in
observing certain scientific and artistic standards.</p>
<p>Moral rules are therefore an instrument of civic power in the hands
of those who administer moral culture, and morality is allied to custom
and law. Men form a society to the extent to which their lives are
ordered by the same morality, custom and law, which jointly constitute
the mores of their society.</p>
<p>We recognize here an important division in the administration of
social lore. For we see that while some systems of social lore are
cultivated for the sake of our intellectual life as individuals, others
are cultivated by the act of ordering our lives socially in accordance
with them. The first is a social fostering of essentially individual
thought, the second an administration of society in accordance with
essentially civic thought.</p>
<p>All thought is valid by its own standards and its progress is
everywhere prompted by its own passions. If thought is to be cultivated
socially, these standards and passions must be shared by a group of
people. To secure this sharing, society must establish appropriate sets
of rights and duties which constitute its cultural institutions. This
will make the life of thought in society dependent at second hand on the
civic institutions of society, that is on group loyalty, property and
power. But this dependence will enter differently into the two types of
thought in society, since civic culture itself sustains the civic
institutions of society, while individual culture is, on the contrary,
itself sustained by these institutions.</p>
<p>I shall not try to assign here either logical or historical priority
to any of the three closely interwoven civic institutions. It may be,
for example, that men establish a social order in the first place for
the sake of making a living, and that the defence of property is thus
the key to group loyalty and to the exercise of power both within the
group, and in defence of it. But whatever the connection between the
three civic institutions, loyalty is parochial, property appetitive and
public authority violent. Thus the civic pole relies ultimately on
coefficients that are essentially at variance with the universal intent
of intellectual or moral standards.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no order of society is thoughtless: it embodies
the civic sense and moral convictions of those who believe in it and
live by it. To a happy people its civic culture is its civic home; and
to this extent the intellectual passions sustaining this culture are in
fact esoteric. But again, in a critical age, this intertwining of civic
exigencies with the ideals of morality will remain precarious. The
genuineness of moral standards will be rendered suspect when it is
realized that they are upheld by force, based on property and imbued
with local loyalty. Indeed, such conflicts may call in question
altogether the intrinsic force of civic thought, and if in this conflict
thought is the loser, thought will be denied here—and here in the first
place—its essential autonomy. Morality will then be reduced to a mere
ideology, and this depreciation of thought will tend to spread and to
bring about eventually the subjection of all thought to local
patriotism, economic interest and the power of the state. Let me now
develop this pattern of conflicting tendencies.</p>
