<h4 id="dwelling-in-and-breaking-out">13. DWELLING IN AND BREAKING
OUT</h4>
<p>A valid articulate framework may be a theory, or a mathematical
discovery, or a symphony. Whichever it is, it will be used by dwelling
in it, and this indwelling can be consciously experienced. Astronomic
observations are made by dwelling in astronomic theory, and it is this
internal enjoyment of astronomy which makes the astronomer interested in
the stars. This is how scientific value is contemplated from within. But
awareness of this joy is dimmed when the formulae of astronomy are used
in a routine manner. It is only when he reflects on its theoretic
vision, or consciously experiences its intellectual powers, that the
astronomer may be said to contemplate astronomy. Similarly for
mathematics. Between the practice of hackneyed exercises on the one hand
and the heuristic visions of the lonely discoverer on the other, lies
the major domain of established mathematics on which the mathematician
consciously dwells by losing himself in the contemplation of its
greatness. A true understanding of science and mathematics includes the
capacity for a contemplative experience of them, and the teaching of
these sciences must aim at imparting this capacity to the pupil. The
task of inducing an intelligent contemplation of music and dramatic art
aims likewise at enabling a person to surrender himself to works of art.
This is neither to observe nor to handle them, but to live in them. Thus
the satisfaction of gaining intellectual control over the external world
is linked to a satisfaction of gaining control over ourselves.</p>
<p>The urge towards this dual satisfaction is persistent; yet it
operates by phases of self-destruction. The construction of a framework
which will handle experience on our behalf begins in the infant and
culminates in the scientist. This endeavour must occasionally operate by
demolishing a hitherto accepted structure, or parts of it, in order to
establish an even more rigorous and comprehensive one in its place.
Scientific discovery, which leads from one such framework to its
successor, bursts the bounds of disciplined thought in an intense if
transient moment of heuristic vision. And while it is thus breaking out,
the mind is for the moment directly experiencing its content rather than
controlling it by the use of any pre-established modes of
interpretation: it is overwhelmed by its own passionate activity.</p>
<p>The scientist’s urge to ponder new problems and break new paths in
seeking to solve them, presents us with the essential restlessness of
the human mind, which calls ever again in question any satisfaction that
it may have previously achieved. We may trace this back primordially to
the level of the animal. It is true that when provoked into action by a
problematical situation the animal tends to establish a new habit which
meets the situation and renders further intelligent effort unnecessary;
but in higher animals this general trend is occasionally opposed and
overcome by playfulness. Animals at play seek excitement, and even when
they have outgrown the playful stage they need activity. Human beings
develop this desire for tension in a variety of forms. Man is one of the
few animals who continue to play throughout adult life. Men have also at
all times gone out in search of adventure and enjoyed tales of
adventure. We all appreciate feats of craftiness, or the solving of
puzzles, and enjoy in innumerable ways the sudden relaxation of a
tension in which we have become involved, whether by actual
participation or merely in imagination. Our gigantic modern amusement
industry betokens the popular forms of this desire; but our craving for
mental dissatisfaction enters also into the highest forms of man’s
spontaneous originality.</p>
<p>The most radical manifestation of this urge to break through all
fixed conceptual frameworks is the act of ecstatic vision. When we
abandon ourselves to the contemplation of the stars we attend to them in
a way which is not an astronomical observation. We look at them with
great interest but without thinking about them. For if we did, our
awareness of the stars would pale into that of mere instances of
apposite conceptions: the focus of our interest being shifted beyond
them, our awareness of them would become subsidiary to this focus and
their vivid impact on the eye and mind would be lost.84</p>
<p>As observers or manipulators of experience we are guided by
experience and pass through experience without experiencing it in
itself. The conceptual framework by which we observe and manipulate
things being present as a screen between ourselves and these things,
their sights and sounds, and the smell and touch of them transpire but
tenuously through this screen, which keeps us aloof from them.
Contemplation dissolves the screen, stops our movement through
experience and pours us straight into experience; we cease to handle
things and become immersed in them. Contemplation has no ulterior
intention or ulterior meaning; in it we cease to deal with things and
become absorbed in the inherent quality of our experience, for its own
sake. And as we lose ourselves in contemplation, we take on an
impersonal life in the objects of our contemplation; while these objects
themselves are suffused by a visionary gleam which lends them a new
vivid and yet dreamlike reality. It is dreamlike, for it is timeless and
without definite spatial location.85 It is not an objective reality; for
it is not the focus of an intelligent perception anticipating future
confirmation by tangible things, but resides merely in the coloured
patches of various shapes which the things present to the eye.
Correspondingly, the impersonality of intense contemplation consists in
a complete participation of the person in that which he contemplates and
not in his complete detachment from it, as would be the case in an
ideally objective observation. Since the impersonality of contemplation
is a self-abandonment, it can be described either as egocentric or as
selfless, depending on whether one refers to the contemplator’s
visionary act or to the submergence of his person.</p>
<p>The religious mystic achieves contemplative communion as a result of
an elaborate effort of thought, supported by ritual. By concentrating on
the presence of God, who is beyond all physical appearances, the mystic
seeks to relax the intellectual control which his powers of perception
instinctively exercise over the scene confronting them. His fixed gaze
no longer scans each object in its turn and his mind ceases to identify
their particulars. The whole framework of intelligent understanding, by
which he normally appraises his impressions, sinks into abeyance and
uncovers a world experienced uncomprehendingly as a divine miracle. The
process is known in Christian mysticism as the via negativa and the
tradition which prescribes it as the only perfect path to God stems from
the Mystic Theology of the Pseudo-Dionysius. It invites us, through a
succession of ‘detachments’, to seek in absolute ignorance union with
Him who is beyond all being and all knowledge.86 We see things then not
focally, but as part of a cosmos, as features of God.</p>
<p>The Christian mystic’s communion with the world seeks a
reconciliation which is part of the technique of redemption. It is man’s
surrender to the love of God, in the hope of gaining his forgiveness and
admission to His presence. The radical anti-intellectualism of the via
negativa expresses the elfort to break out of our normal conceptual
framework and ‘become like little children’. It is akin to the reliance
on the ‘foolishness of God’, that short-cut to the understanding of
Christianity, of which St. Augustine said enviously that it was free to
the simple-minded but impassable to the learned. The Christian faith in
everyday action is just such a sustained effort at breaking out,
sustained by the love and desire for God, a God who can be loved but not
observed. Proximity to God is not an observation, for it overwhelms and
pervades the worshipper. An observer must be relatively detached from
that which he observes, and religious experience transforms the
worshipper. It stands in this respect closer to sensual abandon than to
exact observation. Mystics speak of religious ecstasy in erotic terms,
describing communion with God or with Christ as the union of bride and
bridegroom. In the orgiastic rituals of fertility cults religion and
sensual fervour are openly blended. But religious ecstasy is an
articulate passion and resembles sensual abandon only in the surrender
achieved by it.</p>
<p>This surrender corresponds to the degree to which the worshipper
dwells within the fabric of the religious ritual, which is potentially
the highest degree of indwelling that is conceivable. For ritual
comprises a sequence of things to be said and gestures to be made which
involve the whole body and alert our whole existence. Anyone sincerely
saying and doing these things in a place of worship could not fail to be
completely absorbed in them. He would be partaking devoutly in religious
life.</p>
<p>But the dwelling of the Christian worshipper within the ritual of
divine service differs from any other dwelling within a framework of
inherent excellence, by the fact that this indwelling is not enjoyed.
The confession of guilt, the surrender to God’s mercy, the prayer for
grace, the praise of God, bring about mounting tension. By these ritual
acts the worshipper accepts the obligation to achieve what he knows to
be beyond his own unaided powers and strives towards it in the hope of a
merciful visitation from above. The ritual of worship is expressly
designed to induce and sustain this state of anguish, surrender and
hope. The moment a man were to claim that he had arrived and could now
happily contemplate his own perfection, he would be thrown back into
spiritual emptiness.</p>
<p>The indwelling of the Christian worshipper is therefore a continued
attempt at breaking out, at casting off the condition of man, even while
humbly acknowledging its inescapability. Such indwelling is fulfilled
most completely when it increases this effort to the utmost. It
resembles not the dwelling within a great theory of which we enjoy the
complete understanding, nor an immersion in the pattern of a musical
masterpiece, but the heuristic upsurge which strives to break through
the accepted frameworks of thought, guided by the intimations of
discoveries still beyond our horizon. Christian worship sustains, as it
were, an eternal, never to be consummated hunch: a heuristic vision
which is accepted for the sake of its unresolvable tension. It is like
an obsession with a problem known to be insoluble, which yet follows,
against reason, unswervingly, the heuristic command: ‘Look at the
unknown!’ Christianity sedulously fosters, and in a sense permanently
satisfies, man’s craving for mental dissatisfaction by offering him the
comfort of a crucified God.</p>
<p>Music, poetry, painting: the arts—whether abstract or
representative—are a dwelling in and a breaking out which lie somewhere
between science and worship. Mathematics has been compared with poetry:
‘The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more
than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be
found in mathematics as surely as in poetry’, writes Bertrand Russell.87
Yet there is a great difference in the range of these delights. Owing to
its sensuous content a work of art can affect us far more
comprehensively than a mathematical theorem. Moreover, artistic creation
and enjoyment are contemplative experiences more akin than mathematics
to religious communion. Art, like mysticism, breaks through the screen
of objectivity and draws on our pre-conceptual capacities of
contemplative vision. Poetry ‘purges from our inward sight the film of
familiarity which obscures from us the wonder of our being’, it breaks
into ‘a world to which the familiar world is chaos’ (Shelley).</p>
<p>The mechanism by which a negative theology opens access to the
presence of God is applicable here to a process of artistic creation.
But the negation of familiar meaning may go beyond this. It may usher us
into the presence of nothingness. Sartre’s ‘Nausée’ contains the classic
description of this process. It is a generalization of the technique for
rendering a word incomprehensible by repeating it a number of times. You
say ‘table, table, table . . .’ until the word becomes a mere
meaningless sound. You can destroy meaning wholesale by reducing
everything to its uninterpreted particulars. By paralysing our urge to
subordinate one thing to another, we can eliminate all subsidiary
awareness of things in terms of others and create an atomized, totally
depersonalized universe. In it the pebble in your hand, the saliva in
your mouth and the word in your ear all become external, absurd and
hostile items. This universe is the counterpart of the cosmic vision,
with despair taking the place of hope. It is the logical outcome of
utterly distrusting our participation in holding our beliefs. Left
strictly to itself, this is what the world is like.</p>
<p>Modern art has moved along with existentialist philosophy towards the
exploration of increasingly radical negations. Surrealism distrusts all
meaning and so does modern poetry. It regards easiness as vulgar and
intelligibility as dishonest. Fragmentation alone can then be trusted;
only an aggregate of fragments can carry a meaning that is wholly
ineffable and protected thereby against self doubt.</p>
<p>I have said that the visionary powers of the scientist which lead him
to new discoveries subside, once discovery is achieved, into a peaceful
contemplation of the result—while religious practices culminate in an
endeavour which they seek ever again to achieve. The arts are in an
intermediate position. As in science, the heuristic passion of the
originator far exceeds in intensity the sentiments induced by his
finished product. But the work of art is more akin to an act of
religious devotion in remaining, even in its finished form, an
instrument of more active and comprehensive contemplation. Though the
artist cannot make the public re-live his creative hours, he does make
them enter a wide world of sights, sounds and emotions which they had
never seen, heard or felt before. ‘To achieve this,’ writes Marcel
Proust,</p>
<p>the creative painter, the creative writer proceed like the eye
specialist. The treatment—with the help of their paintings, their
writings—is not always pleasant. When the treatment is concluded they
tell us: you can look now. And thus the world which hasn’t been created
only once, but is recreated every time a new artist emerges, appears to
us perfectly comprehensible—so very different from the old. We now adore
the women of Renoir and Giraudoux, whereas before the treatment we
refused to recognize them as women. And we would love to go for a stroll
in those woods which previously seemed to represent anything but woods,
for example a tapestry woven of thousands of shades with just the
colourings of a forest missing. Such is the passing and new universe
created by the artist, which survives only until a new artist
arises.88</p>
<p>Proust speaks too gently here of the unpleasantness incurred in the
treatment of our eyes by new works of art. We are shocked by the offer
of an unfamiliar system purporting to be meaningful. When the public is
pressed to enter the new framework so as to discover its meaning, their
bewilderment turns into indignation. They are outraged by the respect
paid to what seems to them deserving of contempt and angry at the
implied contempt for their own standards of excellence. There were
scenes of violence around the exhibitions of the early Impressionists in
Paris. There was fighting in the Parisian audiences of Stravinsky in
191389 and similar disturbances had occurred in various countries at the
first performance of some of Wagner’s operas. In such conflicts the two
sides are actually fighting for their lives, or at least part of their
lives. For in the existence of each there is an area which can be kept
in being only by denying reality to an area in the existence of the
other. And such a denial is a shock to the conviction of the other and
an attack against his being, to the extent to which he lives in this
conviction.</p>
<p>We have seen that the major revolutions in science—both in
mathematics and the natural sciences—have also evoked such existential
conflicts. The religious wars of the past and the ideological wars of
the present will be spoken of later on similar lines. But here I must
yet recall that in dealing with scientific controversies of the past we
must inevitably judge their outcome ourselves, in the present. All our
cultural values are the deposit of a succession of past upheavals, but
it is ultimately for us to say what these upheavals signify: whether a
triumph or a disaster. It might be thought that artistic innovations are
not so comprehensive, so that the new achievements of our time may be
added on to the unchanged appreciation of our previous possession. But
this is not so. New movements of art include a re-appreciation of their
ancestry and a corresponding shift in the valuation of all other
artistic achievements of the past. And this necessity re-evokes the
paradox which had already presented itself when I contrasted our belief
in the eternal value of scientific beauty with our fears for its
continued cultivation. For we must admit that truth and beauty may not
prevail, or may not prevail for long. We know how monstrous the judgment
of posterity can be. Special kilns were used in Medieval Rome, on the
site of the Forum and the Campus Martius, to reduce ancient works of art
to lime,90 and at the moment of writing this some of the greatest art
treasures of Soviet Russia—paintings by Matisse, Cézanne, Picasso,
Renoir, etc.—are condemned as degenerate and stowed away in an attic in
Moscow.91 Yet all the same, the acceptance of a novel work must presume
the approval of posterity. Artistic beauty is a token of artistic
reality, in the same sense in which mathematical beauty is a token of
mathematical reality. Its appreciation has universal intent, and bears
witness beyond that to the presence of an inexhaustible fund of meaning
in it which future centuries may yet elicit. Such is our commitment to
indwelling.</p>
<p>A personal knowledge accepted by indwelling may appear merely
subjective. It cannot be fully defended here against this suspicion. But
we can already distinguish between the accrediting of an articulate
framework, be it a theory, a religious ritual or a work of art, and the
accrediting of an experience, whether within such a framework or as
visionary contemplation. It might appear questionable whether there can
be anything to accredit where nothing seems to be asserted. We see what
we see, we smell what we smell and feel what we feel, and there seems no
more to it. Experiences that make no claim whatever would be truly
incorrigible. But we must allow in the first place for the fact that
what we see or feel depends very much on the way we make sense of it,
and in this respect it is corrigible. A white patch may turn black when
we take in the fact that it is part of a black cloth bathed in sunshine.
A child may feel hungry and not know that it wants to eat, until it is
offered food. But even apart from this, any deliberate existential use
of the mind may be said to succeed or fail in achieving a desired
experience. The worshipper strenuously concentrates on his prayer for
the sake of achieving devotion to God; he may succeed or fail. Monks and
nuns afflicted by ‘acidia’ are tormented by failure to pray
wholeheartedly. Experiences can be compared in depth, and the more
deeply they affect us, the more genuine they may be said to be. Besides,
reports of experience can be doubted even if they are correct. A person
may correctly report the colours of a large number of objects, yet not
really see any difference between green and red; so that when it is
eventually found that he is red-green colour blind, we shall conclude
that his previous reports, though correct, were not authentic.</p>
<p>The acceptance of different kinds of articulate systems as mental
dwelling places is arrived at by a process of gradual appreciation, and
all these acceptances depend to some extent on the content of relevant
experiences; but the bearing of natural science on facts of experience
is much more specific than that of mathematics, religion or the various
arts. It is justifiable, therefore, to speak of the verification of
science by experience in a sense which would not apply to other
articulate systems. The process by which other systems than science are
tested and finally accepted may be called, by contrast, a process of
validation.</p>
<p>Our personal participation is in general greater in a validation than
in a verification. The emotional coefficient of assertion is intensified
as we pass from the sciences to the neighbouring domains of thought. But
both verification and validation are everywhere an acknowledgment of a
commitment: they claim the presence of something real and external to
the speaker. As distinct from both of these, subjective experiences can
only be said to be authentic, and authenticity does not involve a
commitment in the sense in which both verification and validation
do.</p>
