<h4 id="forms-of-tacit-assent">6. FORMS OF TACIT ASSENT</h4>
<p>Before proceeding further, I must return for a moment to the point
where I set out my programme for Parts Two and Three. I proposed there
to bring the conception of truth into accordance with the following
three facts which became broadly apparent from the start:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Nearly all knowledge by which man surpasses the animals is
acquired by the use of language.</p></li>
<li><p>The operations of language rely ultimately on our tacit
intellectual powers which are continuous with those of the
animals.</p></li>
<li><p>These inarticulate acts of intelligence strive to satisfy
self-set standards and reach their conclusions by accrediting their own
success.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I have already traced back these decisive tacit coefficients of
articulation to the three basic types of learning in animals; but this
does not account for our intensive personal participation in the search
for and conquest of our knowledge. The origin of this intellectual
striving which (somewhat paradoxically) both shapes our understanding
and assents to its being true, must lie in an active principle. It stems
in fact from our innate sentience and alertness, as manifested already
in the lowest animals in exploratory movements and appetitive drives,
and at somewhat higher levels in the powers of perception. Here we find
self-moving and self-satisfying impulses of both purpose and attention
which antedate learning in animals and themselves actuate learning.
These are the primordial prototypes of the higher intellectual cravings
which both seek satisfaction in the quest for articulate knowledge and
accredit it by their own assent. In reaching out to these prototypes we
must proceed from the higher to the lower forms of intellectual
strivings and, accordingly, shall come to perception first and deal with
drives afterwards.</p>
<p>Perception is manifestly an activity which seeks to satisfy standards
which it sets to itself. The muscles of the eye adjust the thickness of
its lens, so as to produce the sharpest possible retinal image of the
object on which the viewer’s attention is directed, and the eye presents
to him as correct the picture of the object seen in this way. This
effort anticipates the manner in which we strive for understanding and
satisfy our desire for it, by seeking to frame conceptions of the
greatest possible clarity.</p>
<p>But sharpness of contour does not always predominate in the shaping
of what we see. Ames and his school have shown that when a ball set
against a featureless background is inflated, it is seen as if it
retained its size and was coming nearer.43 This illusion seems to be due
to the fact that in this case we accommodate our eyes to a closer range,
even though in consequence the object gets out of focus. Worse still, we
simultaneously increase the convergence of our eyes so that the two
retinal images are displaced from corresponding positions, which would
normally make us see the object double. These defects of the quality and
position of our retinal images are accepted here by the eye, in the urge
to satisfy the more pressing requirement of seeing the object behave in
a reasonable way. Since tennis balls are not known to blow themselves up
to the size of footballs, a ball which does so must be seen as
approaching us, even though in shaping this perception the eye must
override standards of correctness which it would otherwise accept as
binding.</p>
<p>The rule that we follow in shaping the sight of the inflated ball is
one that we taught ourselves as babies, when we first experimented with
approaching a rattle to our eyes and moving it away again. We had to
choose then between seeing the rattle swelling up and shrinking
alternately, or seeing it change its distance while retaining its size,
and we adopted the latter assumption. By this way of seeing things we
eventually constructed a universal interpretative framework that assumes
the ubiquitous existence of objects, retaining their sizes and shapes
when seen at different distances and from different angles, and their
colour and brightness when seen under varying illuminations. (See p. 80
ante.)</p>
<p>This tremendous generalization, on which we base our understanding of
the universe, we have in common with the higher animals. Their native
sensory equipment and ours both set us similar standards of correct
seeing, and it is this primordial standard which induces us to flout, in
the case of the inflated ball, the contrary evidence of our retinal
images. Indeed, it induces us to intervene actively in producing false
evidence of the ball’s approach to our eyes, by a misplaced effort of
visual accommodation, undeterred by the fact that this destroys the
sharpness and the binocular correspondence of our retinal images. The
process illustrates clearly the active principle which seeks to
establish a coherence between all the clues of visual perception, so
that our subsidiary awareness of them in terms of what we see shall
satisfy us of having truly comprehended the things seen.44</p>
<p>In a larger perspective, the present experience of seeing the
inflated ball come nearer to our eyes appears merely as the last of a
life-long chain of experiences encountered and shaped by us, to each of
which we reacted to make sense of it as best we could, and which are now
all subsidiarily effective in the shaping and comprehension of our
present experience. The sensory clues offered by the inflated ball thus
appear to be evaluated together with an immense array of past clues,
gone beyond recall—but not without effective trace.</p>
<p>This process, by which the meaning of sensory clues is established in
terms of our perceptions, is closely analogous to that by which we shape
the meaning of denotative words in the lifelong course of applying them
to a long series of identifiable instances. These linguistic
identifications are in fact based primarily on the sensory
identification of objects at varying distances, under varying angles and
varying illumination, and merely extend the theory of the universe
implied in our sensory interpretations to the wider theory, implied in
the vocabulary by which we talk about things.</p>
<p>We owe to Gestalt psychology much of the available evidence showing
that perception is a comprehension of clues in terms of a whole. But
perception usually operates automatically, and gestalt psychologists
have tended to collect preferentially examples of the type in which
perception goes on without any deliberate effort on the part of the
perceiver and is not even corrigible by his subsequent reconsideration
of the result. Optical illusions are then classed with true perceptions,
both being described as the equilibration of simultaneous stimuli to a
comprehensive whole. Such an interpretation leaves no place for any
intentional effort which prompts our perception to explore and assess in
the quest of knowledge the clues offered to our senses. I believe this
is a mistake, and shall say more in Part Four of the reasons for
recognizing persons who use their senses as centres of intelligent
judgment. At this stage it is enough to recall some features of this
active personal participation.45 We recognize it in the signs of
watchfulness which distinguish an alert animal from one rendered
listless by exhaustion or neurotic disturbance. A sign-learning
experiment can succeed only if we can arouse the animal’s interest in
his situation and make him aware of a problem which can be solved by
straining his powers of observation. This may of course be done by
offering a reward. But once he has learned a trick, the animal’s
inclination to repeat it without reward, for the mere fun of it, shows
that his pleasure in solving a problem has a purely intellectual
component. It has been proved also that the learning of a maze goes on
even when no reward is offered. The animal’s intelligence is
spontaneously alive to the problem of making sense of its
surroundings.46</p>
<p>I shall presently return to these primordial signs of intellectual
passions in the animal. As to ourselves, we should know well the joy of
seeing things; the curiosity aroused by novel objects; the straining of
our senses to make out what it is that we see and the vast superiority
of some people in quickness of eye and penetrating powers of
observation. I believe that we should acknowledge these sensory actions
as proper strivings which we both share and rely on. This endorsement of
our native powers of making sense of our experience according to our own
standards of rationality should also make it possible for us to
acknowledge the ubiquitous contributions made by sense perception to the
tacit components of articulate knowledge. And, eventually, it should
duly condition our manner of acknowledging truth in its articulate
forms.</p>
<p>This analysis of perception bears on the traditional question whether
an object is to be equated to the aggregate of the impressions made by
it on our senses. Ryle’s linguistic analysis dismisses this question as
nonsensical on the ground that sense impressions cannot be observed and
that everything we observe is an object.47 That is true, but the problem
remains. For we can ‘see’ objects without observing them as such. Babies
probably always see them like that. The newborn child experiences the
world without controlling it intellectually, for he lacks the
integrative control of the organs which direct the examination and
identification of external objects. His ocular fixation being deficient,
his eyes stare uncomprehendingly at the things around him. In this way
he can see only coloured patches of no definite shape or size, appearing
at no particular distance and undergoing perpetual changes of shade and
colour. If faced with objects that are effectively camouflaged or
altogether novel to them, adults too see only patches of colour.
Patients born blind and gaining sight after an operation must
laboriously learn to recognize objects; and similarly, chimpanzees
reared in the dark need several weeks of practice to see even so
interesting an object as their nursing bottle.48 Besides, a deliberate
act of contemplation can dissolve objects into patches of colour.49 In
passing from the visionary contemplation of an object to its
observation, we do make an affirmation, therefore, of something which
lies beyond what we had seen before. This is an act involving a
commitment which can prove misguided. It establishes a conception of
reality experienced in terms of a subsidiary awareness of the coloured
patches which had previously been experienced as such in an act of
contemplation.</p>
<p>If perception prefigures all our knowing of things, drive
satisfaction prefigures all practical skills, and the two are always
interwoven. The efforts made to satisfy our cravings and to avoid pain
are guided by perception; and insofar as they lead to the satisfaction
of our appetites this is in its turn a manner of ascertaining a fact,
namely, that certain things are satisfying to our appetites. The pursuit
of drives is a mute exploration, which in the event of success leads to
a mute affirmation; and—as in the case of sensory perception—the process
by which information is gained itself selects and correlates from its
own point of view the things to which it refers, and judges them in
their relation to its own motivation. Though the information that we
thus acquire—for example by eating, smoking, or making love—is
necessarily centred on ourselves as agents, such information does in
fact enter emphatically into our articulate picture of the world. To a
disembodied intellect, entirely incapable of lust, pain or comfort, most
of our vocabulary would be incomprehensible. For the majority of nouns
and verbs refer either to living beings, whose behaviour can be
appreciated only from an experience of the drives which actuate them, or
to things made by man for his own use, which again can be appreciated
only through an understanding of the human needs to which they
minister.</p>
<p>Drive satisfaction and perception are the primordial rudiments of two
classes of intelligent behaviour which manifest themselves—at a higher,
though still inarticulate level—in learning of two types, the practical
and the cognitive. The first (type A) enlarges on innate sensory-motor
faculties by the grasping of new means-ends relationships, while the
second (type B) deploys the animal’s innate sensory powers in the
learning of new signevent relations.</p>
<p>Learning of type C, by which an animal comes to understand and
control a complex situation, uses both its motor and sensory faculties
as part of a primitive conceptual operation. We may recognize the
earliest rudiments of such combined operations in the animal’s
exploratory behaviour and in the incessant adjustment of its balance,
culminating, e.g., in its stratagems for restoring its normal position
when turned upside-down. These drives, which preserve the animal’s
rational coherence both within itself and in relation to its
environment, foreshadow the learning of alternative part-whole relations
at a more highly developed level of intelligence.</p>
<p>All these inarticulate achievements are guided by self-satisfaction.
The adaptation of our sense organs, the urge of our appetites and fears,
our capacity for locomotion, balancing and righting, as well as the
processes of learning which an inarticulate intelligence develops from
these strivings, can be said to be what they are and to achieve what
they are said to achieve, only to the extent to which we accredit their
implied assent to their own performance, shaped by them in accordance
with standards set by themselves to themselves. Therefore, at each of
the innumerable points at which our articulation is rooted in our
sub-intellectual strivings, or in any inarticulate feats of our
intelligence, we rely on tacit performances of our own, the rightness of
which we implicitly confirm.</p>
