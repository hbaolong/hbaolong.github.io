<h4 id="evasion-of-commitment">4. EVASION OF COMMITMENT</h4>
<p>Kant tried to salvage the justification of mechanics and geometry
from the objectivist dilemma by deducing their basic concepts as a
priori categories or forms of experience. But since the end of the
nineteenth century this has proved less and less tenable and an
alternative teaching of Kant, represented by his regulative principles,
gained predominance instead.</p>
<p>By regulative principles, in the general sense in which the term is
employed here, I mean all manner of recommendations to act on a belief
while denying, disguising, or otherwise minimizing the fact that we are
holding this belief. Originally, Kant had recommended that certain
generalizations (as for example the teleological aptness of living
organisms) should be entertained as if they were true, without assuming
that they were true. However, Kant does not say that we should entertain
these generalizations as if they were true, even though we knew them to
be false. His recommendation to entertain them as if they were true is
thus seen to be based on the tacit assumption that they are in fact
true. By conveying this assumption without asserting it, he avoids any
formulation which would require to be upheld as his own personal
judgment.</p>
<p>Modern descriptions of scientific truths as mere working hypotheses
or interpretative policies are generalizations of the Kantian regulative
principles to the whole of science.4 For we would never use a hypothesis
which we believe to be false, nor a policy which we believe to be
wrong.5 The suggestion which usually accompanies these regulative
formulations of science, that all scientific theories are merely
tentative, since scientists are ready to modify their conclusions in the
face of new evidence, is irrelevant, for it does not affect the
fiduciary content of a hypothesis or policy. There are admittedly
various degrees of belief and our beliefs are changing. But a belief
does not cease to exist merely because it is weak or because it is
variable. Zeno foolishly denied that physical motion was possible,
because an object had to be at some place at every moment of time; it is
equally foolish to argue, in reverse to Zeno, that we are never
committed because our commitments are changing.</p>
<p>The purpose of endorsing one’s belief in science without asserting
it, can be achieved also by understating the claims of science to the
point of insignificance and recommending science on these insufficient
grounds. When science is said to be merely the simplest description of
the facts, or a convenient shorthand, we rely on it that the reader will
use the term ‘simple’ and ‘convenient’ in the sense of ‘scientifically
simple’ and ‘scientifically convenient’. We then accept science because
it is scientific and not for being simple or convenient in the ordinary
sense, which it is not. This procedure was described in earlier chapters
as the bowdlerization of science. It results in a pseudo-substitution
which refers to the mainsprings of scientific conviction in an
emasculated language, for the sake of avoiding offence to a philosophy
which cannot face up to our actual intellectual commitments.</p>
