<h4 id="acceptance-of-calling">10. ACCEPTANCE OF CALLING</h4>
<p>We meet here the powers which call us into being: into our particular
form of existence. Involuntary co-efficients of commitment, of which I
have given instances before, become paramount here. Every deliberate act
of our own relies on the involuntary functions of our body. Our thoughts
are limited by our innate capabilities. Our senses and emotions can be
enhanced by education, but these ramifications remain dependent on their
native roots. Moreover, since our intellectual judgment ever relies on
the services of an automatic sensory apparatus, it may always be
misguided by it. The moral control of our drives, which would harness
them to the service of a reasonably satisfying life, is ever in danger
of being swamped and disorganized by them. Worse still, we are creatures
of circumstance. Every mental process by which man surpasses the animals
is rooted in the early apprenticeship by which the child acquires the
idiom of its native community and eventually absorbs the whole cultural
heritage to which it succeeds. Great pioneers may modify this idiom by
their own efforts, but even their outlook will remain predominantly
determined by the time and place of their origin. Our believing is
conditioned at its source by our belonging. And this reliance on the
cultural machinery of our society continues through life. We go on
accepting the information given out by its leading centres of publicity
and relying on its recognized authorities for most of our judgments of
value. Nor are we merely passive participants in the social framework,
sustaining the orthodoxy to which we adhere. For every society allocates
powers and profits, to which the adherents of the intellectual status
quo lend a measure of support. Respect for tradition inevitably shields
also some iniquitous social relations.</p>
<p>How can we claim to arrive at a responsible judgment with universal
intent, if the conceptual framework in which we operate is borrowed from
a local culture and our motives are mixed up with the forces holding on
to social privilege?</p>
<p>From the point of view of a critical philosophy, this fact would
reduce all our convictions to the mere products of a particular location
and interest. But I do not accept this conclusion. Believing as I do in
the justification of deliberate intellectual commitments, I accept these
accidents of personal existence as the concrete opportunities for
exercising our personal responsibility. This acceptance is the sense of
my calling.</p>
<p>This sense of calling may acknowledge many of the environmental
antecedents of my thought as fulfilling a more primitive commitment. For
the child which is prompted to listen and acquire the speech and
conceptions of adults is an active intellectual centre. Though his
efforts are not conducted deliberately, they are yet the intellectual
gropings of a person in search of a valid result. Within the
circumstances of his upbringing, this process fulfils, in my belief, the
purpose of the child’s mental powers and should be relied upon to
operate within this framework, just as we rely on our own personal
judgment for the solution of consciously envisaged problems. As I
acknowledge, in reflecting on the process of discovery, the gap between
the evidence and the conclusions which I draw from them, and account for
my bridging of this gap in terms of my personal responsibility, so also
will I acknowledge that in childhood I have formed my most fundamental
beliefs by exercising my native intelligence within the social milieu of
a particular place and time. I shall submit to this fact as defining the
conditions within which I am called upon to exercise my
responsibility.</p>
<p>I accept these limits, for it is impossible to hold myself
responsible beyond such limits. To ask how I would think if I were
brought up outside any particular society, is as meaningless as to ask
how I would think if I were born in no particular body, relying on no
particular sensory and nervous organs. I believe, therefore, that as I
am called upon to live and die in this body, struggling to satisfy its
desires, recording my impressions by aid of such sense organs as it is
equipped with, and acting through the puny machinery of my brain, my
nerves and my muscles, so I am called upon also to acquire the
instruments of intelligence from my early surroundings and to use these
particular instruments to fulfil the universal obligations to which I am
subject. A sense of responsibility within situations requiring
deliberate decisions demands as its logical complement a sense of
calling with respect to the processes of intellectual growth which are
its necessary logical antecedents.</p>
<p>The extension of commitment from deliberate judgments to innate
intelligent impulses points towards further generalizations to include
the whole process of life. My body may be said to be alive to the extent
to which its parts are functioning as elements in a joint operation and
these operational principles are rational. Life is a stratagem, in which
each element must rely on it that the other elements will support it,
and each consecutive step in the sequence is taken in the expectation
that the next will suitably continue it. The higher the organism, the
more involved is its plan of action and the more completely does each
section of it rely in its location and timing, on the location and
timing of all the others for its usefulness to the whole; the more
useless does each become in itself. And consequently, the more fully is
the living body committed to comprehensive governing principles of
universal standing.</p>
<p>Thus we can see the same fundamental structure of personal commitment
revealed on extremely different levels, with a correspondingly wide
variation of its internal balance. The most strictly universalized
processes of inference are shown to rely ultimately on their
inarticulate interpretation by a person accepting them, and life
pursuing its self-centred primitive urges is shown to rely on universal
technical principles; while between the two we meet man’s momentous acts
of responsible commitment, made by accepting his own starting-point in
space and time, as the condition of his own calling.</p>
<p>Within its commitments the mind is warranted to exercise much ampler
powers than those by which it is supposed to operate under objectivism;
but by the very fact of assuming this new freedom it submits to a higher
power to which it had hitherto refused recognition. Objectivism seeks to
relieve us from all responsibility for the holding of our beliefs. That
is why it can be logically expanded to systems of thought in which the
responsibility of the human person is eliminated from the life and
society of man. In recoiling from objectivism, we would acquire a
nihilistic freedom of action but for the fact that our protest is made
in the name of higher allegiances. We cast off the limitations of
objectivism in order to fulfil our calling, which bids us to make up our
minds about the whole range of matters with which man is properly
concerned.</p>
<p>Those who are satisfied by hoping that their intellectual commitments
fulfil their calling, will not find their hopes discouraged when
realizing on reflection that they are only hopes. I have said that my
belief in commitment is a commitment of the very kind that it
authorizes: therefore, if its justification be questioned, it finds
confirmation in itself. Moreover, any such confirmation will likewise
prove stable towards renewed critical reflection, and so on,
indefinitely. Thus, by contrast to a statement of fact claiming to be
impersonal, an affirmation made in terms of a commitment gives rise to
no insatiable sequence of subsequent justifications. Instead of
indefinitely shifting an ever open problem within the regress of the
objectivist criticism of objectivist claims, our reflections now move
from an original state of intellectual hopes to a succession of equally
hopeful positions; so that by rising above this movement and reflecting
on it as a whole we find the continuance of this regress
unnecessary.</p>
<p>Commitment offers to those who accept it legitimate grounds for the
affirmation of personal convictions with universal intent. Standing on
these grounds, we claim that our participation is personal, not
subjective, except in so far as it is compulsive. While it then lies
beyond our responsibility, it is yet transformed by our sense of
responsibility into part of our calling. Our subjective condition may be
taken to include the historical setting in which we have grown up. We
accept these as the assignment of our particular problem. Our personhood
is assured by our simultaneous contact with universal aspirations which
place us in a transcendent perspective.</p>
<p>The stage on which we thus resume our full intellectual powers is
borrowed from the Christian scheme of Fall and Redemption. Fallen Man is
equated to the historically given and subjective condition of our mind,
from which we may be saved by the grace of the spirit. The technique of
our redemption is to lose ourselves in the performance of an obligation
which we accept, in spite of its appearing on reflection impossible of
achievement. We undertake the task of attaining the universal in spite
of our admitted infirmity, which should render the task hopeless,
because we hope to be visited by powers for which we cannot account in
terms of our specifiable capabilities. This hope is a clue to God, which
I shall trace further in my last chapter, by reflecting on the course of
evolution.</p>
