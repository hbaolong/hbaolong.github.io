<h4 id="indeterminacy-and-self-reliance">7. INDETERMINACY AND
SELF-RELIANCE</h4>
<p>We have seen that the progress of scientific discovery depends on
heuristic commitments which establish contacts with reality, and that
the hazards incurred in entering on such a commitment are twofold:
namely (1) that it may be mistaken and (2) that even if it is right, its
future scope and significance is largely indeterminate. The foregoing
section has followed up the hazards of error in the domain of the most
primitive deliberate assertions, such as are made by the eye in deciding
how to see an ambiguous set of objects. I shall supplement this now by
briefly recalling the hazards incurred at the same level, owing to the
indeterminate nature of real facts. This unspecifiable fund of
implications can be revealed in a fact that is simple enough to be
discovered by an earthworm.</p>
<p>An earthworm was taught in a famous experiment by Yerkes’ to take the
right turn at the branching of a T-shaped tube (through the stem of
which it was made to crawl) by inflicting on it an electric shock
whenever it tried to turn left. It took about a hundred trials to
establish this habit.11 A later investigator, L. Heck, confirmed this
experiment and carried it a stage further.12 After the earthworm’s
training was completed, he inverted the conditions between right and
left. The new problem set to the worm was the reverse of that which it
had first solved, but it still resembled it in the fact that one branch
of the tube was painful to enter, while the other had no sting in it.
The earthworm’s behaviour in this second test was determined both by the
contrast and the similarity of the two consecutive problems. At first
the worm consistently turned to the right where it was now met with an
electric shock. During this phase its previous training may be said to
have exercised a misleading effect on it. But presently (after about
thirty runs) the worm began to turn with increasing frequencyinto the
branch now free from obstruction, and it eventually acquired the habit
of turning in the direction opposite to that which it had been trained
to take in the first place, within a much shorter series of trials than
it had taken to establish the original reverse habit. The primary
training which had taught the worm to turn in one direction thus proved
a powerful help in training it subsequently to turn in the opposite
direction. Here it is the similarity which the second problem bears to
the first that asserts itself.</p>
<p>Since the range of problems which may arise in the future is
unlimited and totally unpredictable, the bias which we adopt in respect
to these problems by committing ourselves to any particular belief today
is equally inexhaustible and unpredictable. Confrontation with these
problems may bring to light, therefore, an indeterminate range of hidden
implications that are inherent in any of our present beliefs.</p>
<p>I have mentioned this before in Part Two, ch. 5, when showing that
all learning, even in animals, establishes a latent knowledge, the range
of which is indeterminate. In the same chapter I enlarged upon this
further by suggesting that in all our thoughts—whether tacit or
articulate—we rely jointly on two faculties, namely (1) on the power of
our conceptual framework, based on reality, to assimilate new
experiences and (2) on our capacity to adapt this framework in the very
act of applying it, so that it may increase its hold on reality. We can
see this now in the perspective of commitment. The intellectual daring
which impels our acts of commitment retains its dynamic character within
the state of commitment, in relying on its own resourcefulness to deal
with the unspecifiable implications of the knowledge acquired by the act
of commitment. In this selfreliance lies our ultimate power for keeping
our heads in the face of a changing world. It makes us feel at home in a
universe presenting us with a succession of unprecedented situations and
even makes us enjoy life best precisely on these occasions, which force
us to respond to novelty by reinterpreting our accepted knowledge.</p>
