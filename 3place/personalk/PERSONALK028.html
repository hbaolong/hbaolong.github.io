<h4 id="inarticulate-intelligence">2. INARTICULATE INTELLIGENCE</h4>
<p>I shall start on this task systematically by returning to the
analysis of the inarticulate manifestations of intelligence in animals
and children. I accept for the moment without discussion the usual
distinction between the automatic functioning of the organism, including
its instinctive performances, and the higher forms of behaviour not
specifically included in the animal’s native repertoire. Such behaviour
will be called learning in which term I shall include also acts of
problem solving. Learning will be regarded as a sign of intelligence, in
contrast to the functioning of internal organs or to instinctive
performances which will be classed as sub-intelligent.4</p>
<p>The various modes of learning fall readily into three classes, two of
which are more primitive and are rooted respectively in the motility and
the sentience of the animal, while the third handles both these
functions of animal life in an implicit operation of intelligence. This
division follows E. R. Hilgard (Theories of Learning (1948; 2nd edition,
1956)), and to some extent also O. H. Mowrer (Learning Theory and
Personality Dynamics (1950)), who in their turn were guided to a
considerable extent by E. C. Tolman (Purposive Behavior in Animals and
Men (1932)). My presentation differs, however, so much from that of
these authors that I can only acknowledge my debt to them here in a
summary fashion.</p>
<p>Type A. Trick Learning. The best demonstration of motoric learning is
B. F. Skinner’s.5 He places a hungry rat in a box equipped with a lever,
the depression of which releases a food pellet. The rat will first roam
about the box, sniffing and pawing at any prominent object. Having once
accidentally depressed the lever, it eats the pellet so released. After
a while the rat may happen to depress the lever again and learning will
set in, showing itself by the fact that the action rapidly becomes more
frequent. Finally the rat becomes engaged assiduously in lever-pressing
and pellet-eating; and the process of learning is complete.</p>
<p>This amplification of the rat’s feeding behaviour is elicited here by
providing an object which it can use as a tool, and it consists in
discovering and practising the proper use of this tool. We may say that
the rat has learned to contrive an effect that is useful to it, or else
that it has discovered a useful means-end relationship. The
anthropomorphic imputations implied here—and similarly in the following
survey of learning—are deliberate and will be justified later in Part
Four against behaviourist objections.</p>
<p>Type B. Sign-learning. A dog which is trained to expect an electric
shock shortly after a red light is flashed on a screen, has recognized a
sign foretelling an event. This type of learning has been sharply
illuminated, but also somewhat distorted, by Pavlov’s experiments, in
which he induced salivation in dogs by giving them definite signs (like
ringing a bell) that food was forthcoming. In Pavlov’s terms the sound
of a bell announcing food, the conditioned stimulus, replaces in its
effect the presentation of food, the unconditioned stimulus. Similarly,
according to Pavlov, a red light announcing the imminence of an electric
shock would be supposed to act like the shock itself on the trained
animal. But none of these is quite true: the dog does not jump and snap
at the bell as if it were food, nor does a red light cause the kind of
muscular contraction which results from an electric shock. In fact, the
‘conditioned response’ differs quite generally from the original
‘unconditioned response’, in the same way in which the anticipation of
an event differs from the effect of the event itself.6 This entitles us
to say, in contrast to Pavlov’s description of the process, that in
sign-learning the animal is taught to expect an event by recognizing a
sign foretelling the event.</p>
<p>A closer analysis of sign-learning is provided by using a
discrimination box, of which there are different types. For example, the
animal is faced with two doors leading to two compartments with
different markings that can be shifted from one door to the other. The
animal, usually a rat, is trained to recognize the marking which
signifies the presence of food behind the door as distinct from the
other marking, behind which no food will be found. The greater freedom
of action given here to the animal allows its behaviour to reveal some
of the preliminary stages through which learning is achieved.</p>
<p>The first stage consists in realizing the presence of a problem. To
induce this, the animal is presented with a version of the situation so
simplified that it grasps it at a glance. Food is first offered openly
in one or the other of the two compartments; then the entrances to the
compartments are closed and the animal is made to push open the doors,
behind which he will find either the food or an empty space. These
experiences establish an awareness that food is hidden in one of the two
compartments and that it can be got at by pushing open the right door.
The understanding of this problem rouses the animal to search for food
by pushing its way into one or the other compartment. It is by such
attempts at guessing the right compartment that it will eventually hit
on the fact that certain markings on the door signify the presence of
food behind the door.</p>
<p>There is evidence that during these attempts the animal’s choices are
not random, but follow from the start some such system as ‘turn always
to the right’ or ‘always to the left’ or ‘alternately right and left’,
until it eventually tumbles to the relevance of the markings and then
fairly rapidly identifies the true one.7 The whole process clearly shows
the animal’s capacity to be intrigued by a situation, to pursue
consistently the intimation of a hidden possibility for bringing it
under control, and to discover in the pursuit of this aim an orderly
context concealed behind its puzzling appearances. The essential
features of problem-solving are thus apparent even at this primitive
level.</p>
<p>While sign-learning results, like trick learning, in new motoric
habits, these are comparatively trivial and only of secondary
importance. What the animal will eventually do can be readily varied by
slightly modifying the experimental apparatus, so that the learning of
the sign event relationship results in quite different motoric actions.
Type B learning consists therefore not primarily in the contriving of
skilful actions, but in the observing of a sign-event relation on which
these actions follow. Such learning is grafted primarily not on motility
but on perception. Animals like rats and dogs are richly equipped by
nature to grasp coherently the things they perceive, and sign learning
appears to be an extension of this perceptive faculty by the power of
intelligence.8</p>
<p>Animals learn only when impelled by desire or fear, and in this sense
all learning is purposive. But while in the contriving of a useful trick
purpose guides action directly, the observing of a useful sign is guided
only by a general alertness of the senses, which is stimulated but not
determined by any specific purpose. Thus trick learning, like the
performance of human skills, is more completely controlled by purpose
than sign-learning, which, like connoisseurship, is primarily the
achievement of strained attention.</p>
<p>Type C. When an animal contrives a new trick it reorganizes its
behaviour to serve a purpose by exploiting a particular means-end
relationship; and similarly, the animal learning a new sign reorganizes
its sensory field by establishing in it a valid and useful coherence
between a sign and the event signified by it. Both forms of learning
establish a time sequence, whether contrived or observed by the learner.
(Type A or B.) Learning of Type C occurs when the process of
reorganization is achieved not by a particular act of contriving or
observing, but by achieving a true understanding of a situation which
had been open to inspection almost entirely from the start. Type C has
been described as latent learning, to suggest that in such cases the
animal learns something which it can intelligently manifest in more
numerous and less predictable ways than the lessons of trick or sign
learning. Thus a rat which has learned to run a maze will show a high
degree of ingenuity in choosing the shortest alternative path when one
of the paths has been closed to it.9 This behaviour of the rat is such
as would be accounted for by its having acquired a mental map of the
maze, which it can use for its guidance when faced with different
situations within the maze.10</p>
<p>The capacity for deriving from a latent knowledge of a situation a
variety of appropriate routes or alternative modes of behaviour amounts
to a rudimentary logical operation. It prefigures the use of an
articulate interpretative framework on which we rely as a representation
of a complex situation, drawing from it ever new inferences regarding
further aspects of that situation. Latent learning is transformed into
pure problem-solving when the situation confronting the subject can be
taken in by it from the start, at a glance. This reduces exploration to
a minimum and shifts the task altogether to the subsequent process of
inference. Learning becomes then an act of ‘insight’, preceded by a
period of quiet deliberation; as we see demonstrated by the performances
of Köhler’s chimpanzees.</p>
<p>The functioning of a latent understanding as a guide to the act of
problem-solving comes out most clearly by contrast, when understanding
is only partial. The chimpanzee who piles up packing-cases in a grossly
unstable manner (for example by placing them edgewise), shows that he
has grasped the principle of gaining height by constructing a tower on
which to climb up, without knowing the conditions for making the
constructions stable. Its error is a ‘good error’, as Köhler calls it,11
for it testifies to an ingenious process of inference which overreaches
itself by relying partly on mistaken assumptions. Thus the very rise of
inferential power brings with it the conjoint capacity for inferential
error. We shall presently see this manifested further in the process of
transposing practical problems into verbal terms (p. 93).</p>
<p>The development of inarticulate behaviour up to the point where it
approximates and finally achieves an articulate form, can be watched in
the maturing child. Observations of this kind, carried out extensively
by Piaget, have been analysed by him in terms of such logical operations
as he finds embodied in the behaviour of the child at consecutive stages
of its maturation.12 At the earliest stage, even more primitive than
that usually studied in intelligence tests on animals, the infant can be
observed building up a spatial framework. At first he does not recognize
objects as permanent, but gives up any attempt to find them as soon as
they are covered up. For example, when a watch is hidden by a
handkerchief the child, instead of lifting the handkerchief, withdraws
his hand. But with growing maturity, he learns that objects continue to
exist even while not seen or felt, and learns to see them as having
constant sizes and shapes though presented at different distances and
from different angles.13 Further improvements in the capacity for
spatial orientation may be tested, for example, by an experiment in
which three dolls of different colours strung on a wire are moved behind
a screen, and children are asked to predict (1) the direct order of
reappearance at the opposite side of the screen, and (2) the reverse
order of return. The reverse order is predicted only at about 4–5 years,
at the end of what Piaget calls the ‘preconceptual period’.14</p>
<p>The progress achieved by the child in this manner has been described
by Piaget as a development of its intelligence, but it might be more
precise to call it an increased mental discipline, achieved by
establishing a fixed interpretative framework of growing complexity. An
inference guided by a fixed framework can always be traced back to its
premisses, and such ‘reversibility’, Piaget points out, may be regarded
as a characteristic feature of disciplined thought.15</p>
<p>Reversibility can be contrasted with the irreversible processes which
predominate throughout an important part of intelligent behaviour. In
each case of the three types (A) Trick learning, (B) Sign learning, (C)
Latent learning, we may distinguish between the process of learning,
which is irreversible, and the performances achieved by learning, which
are comparatively reversible. In the first two cases the distinction is
clear enough. In case A we have the irreversible act of contriving a
trick, as distinct from the subsequent performances, which involve no
change in it and in this sense may be said to be reversible. In case B
we have the irreversible act of establishing a sign-event relation, as
distinct from the subsequent reversible performance of reacting to a
sign already recognized as such. In case C the distinction is perhaps
not always so clear. The first, irreversible phase may be one of
systematic exploration, resulting in the gradual building up of an
interpretative framework, but it may also be merely a puzzled
contemplation of a situation, leading to a solution in a flash of
insight. Again, the amount of ingenuity contributing an irreversible
coefficient to the conceptual operations of the second phase, may vary
considerably. Yet in spite of this we may distinguish also in case C,
clearly enough, between an act of insight, which is irreversible, and
the resultant performance, which is comparatively reversible.</p>
<p>In each case the actual process of learning is covered by the first
stage, while the second stage consists in displaying the knowledge
acquired by learning. We may call the first a heuristic act by contrast
to the second which is of a more or less routine character. For type A
the heuristic act is a contriving; for B an observing; for C an
understanding. The routine acts are: for A, the repeating of a trick,
for B, the continued responding to a sign, and for C, the solving of a
routine problem. The capacity for contriving, observing or understanding
something for the first time cannot be rated intellectually below that
of the performances based on the resultant knowledge. Therefore, we
acknowledge already at this primitive level the existence of two kinds
of intelligence: one achieving innovations, irreversibly, the other
operating a fixed framework of knowledge, reversibly. Although at the
inarticulate level of intellectual life this distinction may appear
precarious, its more fully established manifestations in the
corresponding domains of articulate intelligence are clearly enough
prefigured here.</p>
<p>Our three types of animal learning are primordial forms of three
faculties more highly developed in man. Trick-learning may be regarded
as an act of invention; sign-learning as an act of observation; latent
learning as an act of interpretation. The use of language develops each
of these faculties into a distinctive science to which the other two
contribute subsidiarily.</p>
<p>Thus, invention will include at its highest reaches the whole array
of ingenious and useful operations of the kind that are described in
patents and form the subjects of engineering and technology.
Observation, even when restricted to the kind of things animals are
concerned with in learning experiments, may be taken to include at the
highest articulate level the whole of natural science. Experimental
conditioning amounts from the animal’s point of view to a process of
inductive inference. An animal recognizing a sign-event relationship is
therefore producing a primordial form of observational science.</p>
<p>The transition from inarticulate learning of type C to its articulate
counterpart (which I have called Interpretation), has been traced in
Piaget’s work on the genesis of disciplined thought in children.
Eventually, the operational rules implicitly governing the intelligent
behaviour of the child growing up to adolescence will comprise a system
of logic, together with the elements of mathematics and classical
mechanics. The highest articulate forms of this type of intelligence are
mathematics, logic and mathematical physics, or more generally, the
deductive sciences. While applied mathematics is object-directed, pure
mathematics has no outside object; being concerned with objects of its
own creation, it may be described as ‘object creating’.</p>
<p>At the articulate level of intelligence, heuristic acts fall
distinctly apart from mere routine applications of established
knowledge. They are the acts of the inventor and discoverer, which
require originality and offer scope for genius, differing in this both
from the performance of engineers who apply known devices and of
teachers demonstrating established results of science. Intellectual acts
of a heuristic kind make an addition to knowledge and are in this sense
irreversible, while the ensuing routine performances operate within an
existing framework of knowledge and are to this extent reversible. The
wider significance of the difference between reversible and irreversible
mental processes, and the bearing of this distinction on that between
specifiable and unspecifiable forms of knowledge, will become apparent
later.</p>
