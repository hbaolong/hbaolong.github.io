<h4 id="originality-in-animals">5. ORIGINALITY IN ANIMALS</h4>
<p>The first time I mentioned the inventive powers of animals I used
Köhler’s examples, in which a chimpanzee achieves a set purpose by
suitably reorganizing his field of vision. Next I identified in a rat
the latent knowledge of a maze that it had learned to run, by its
capacity for suitably reorganizing its knowledge to deal with the
emergency of blocked paths.5 The Yerkes-Heck experiment showed how
earthworms can reorganize latent knowledge indefinitely in the face of
new circumstances.6 On a similarly inarticulate level, men grope their
way towards a skilful performance, unconsciously readjusting the
co-ordination of their muscles in the direction of success.7 The way we
strain our eyes in order to ‘make out’ what it is that we see, gave us
an example of a discovery pursued by conjointly reorganizing a set of
unconscious muscular actions with our simultaneous interpretation of the
impressions shaped by these actions.8 This urge to reorganize our
experiences and capabilities in a manner more satisfying to ourselves
was traced upwards through the entire range of human inventiveness. It
defined man the innovator and explorer, passionately pouring himself
into an existence closer to reality.</p>
<p>All this was surveyed with a view to the reinterpretation of truth
carried out in Part Three. I have accepted there a fiduciary commitment
which authorizes me to choose my fundamental beliefs in harmony with my
total situation; I must try to decide now, on such grounds, whether the
originality of animals and men can be accounted for by some ingenious
automatic machinery, or should be acknowledged as an independent force
operating through the body in combination with the existing machinery of
the body.9</p>
<p>The machine-like conception of living beings can be extended to
account in principle for their adaptive capacities. An automatically
piloted aeroplane approximates the skills of an air pilot. Its
mechanical self-regulation co-ordinates its activities in the service of
a steady purpose, and it may even appear to show a measure of
resourcefulness in responding to ever new, not exactly foresecable
situations. There is a school of thought today which passionately
pursues this mechanical conception of all vital adaptive functions,
including the activities of human intelligence. I shall briefly
enumerate the clues which suggest to me that this endeavour is
misguided.</p>
<p>Our existing knowledge of physics and chemistry can certainly not
suffice to account for our experience of active, resourceful living
beings, for their activities are often accompanied by conscious efforts
and feelings of which our physics and chemistry know nothing. But let us
assume for the sake of argument that physics and chemistry could be
expanded to account for the sentience of certain physico-chemical
systems. It might not be inconceivable that a machine of sufficient
complexity would develop conscious thinking, without losing its
machine-like character. However, conceived in this sense, conscious
thoughts would be the mere accompaniment of automatic operations, on the
outcome of which they could exercise no influence. We should have to
imagine, for example, that Shakespeare’s conscious thoughts had no
effect on the writing of his plays; that the plays were subsequently
performed by actors whose thoughts had no effect on their acting; while
successive generations of audiences flocked to see the plays without
being impelled by the fact that they enjoyed them.</p>
<p>None of this is strictly inconceivable; it forms a closed
interpretative system. Though nobody can believe in it in practice, one
might regard this as a failing due to primitive habits of mind which a
perfect scientific knowledge would eliminate. I am committed to a
different belief. I accept the responsibility for drawing an ever
indeterminate knowledge from unspecifiable clues, with an aim to
universal validity; and this belief includes the acknowledgment of other
persons as responsible centres of equally unspecifiable operations,
aiming likewise at universal validity.10 To me, therefore, the works of
Shakespeare offer a massive demonstration of a creativity which cannot
be explained in terms of an automatic mechanism. In my view, whenever we
are confronted by a work of genius and submit to the leadership of its
author, we emphatically acknowledge originality as a performance, the
procedure of which we cannot specify.11</p>
<p>This conceptual framework strongly suggests to me the presence of an
active centre operating unspecifiably in all animals. In ‘The Logic of
Affirmation’ (Part Three, ch. 8), I have linked the unformalizable
powers of originality to the whole range of tacit, often passionate,
coefficients which account for all the powers of an articulate
intelligence. I have said that this tacit urge sustains throughout our
culture the coherence and fertility of fixed symbolic operations that
were initially contrived by this urge itself. I believe that, on grounds
of continuity, we should acknowledge that the same urge operates also
primordially throughout the animal kingdom. There are then two
principles at work in animals: namely, (1) the use of machine-like
contrivances and (2) the inventive powers of animal life. Accordingly,
while the animal’s machinery embodies fixed operational principles, this
machinery would be impelled, guided and readapted by the animal’s
unspecifiable inventive urge—even as rigid symbolic operations are
accredited and steadily reinterpreted by the tacit powers that affirm
them.</p>
<p>For the sake of brevity, I shall present here only a few
characteristic pieces of evidence for the existence of such generalized
creative powers. Lashley12 has observed that mutilated rats which had
learned a maze continued to find their way through it, though the neural
paths used in learning had been cut. Naturally, the manner of their
progression was completely altered: ‘One drags himself through with his
forepaws (writes Lashley); another falls at every step but gets through
by a series of lunges; a third rolls over completely in making each
turn, yet manages to avoid rolling into a cul-de-sac and makes an
errorless run. . . .’ He concludes that ‘If the customary sequence of
movements employed in reaching the food is rendered impossible, another
set, not previously used, and constituting an entirely different motor
pattern, may be directly and efficiently reconstituted, without any
random activity. . . .’ The operated rats retain a memory and a purpose
that evokes in each of them a different set of operational principles
for achieving the same persistent aim. These instantly improvised
alternative combinations of organs may be said to be equipotential in
achieving the same overall action. They offer a series of solutions for
the same technical problems.13</p>
<p>Similar instances of equipotentiality may be found at levels far
above and far below the maze-running rat. With advancing age Renoir
became crippled with arthritis. He lost the use both of his feet and
hands; his fingers were immobilized in perpetual cramped rigidity. Yet
Renoir went on painting for another twenty years until his death, with a
brush fixed to his forearm. In this manner he produced a great number of
pictures hardly distinguishable in quality or style from those he had
painted before. The skill and the vision which he had developed and
mastered by the use of his fingers, was no longer in his fingers. It had
become a knowledge and purpose of a highly abstract, totally
unspecifiable kind: a purpose which could evoke from his mutilated body
a set of implementations that were equipotential to his previous
performance.</p>
<p>At the other extreme of the evolutionary scale Buddenbrock14 and
Bethe15 have shown that insects, spiders, centipedes and water-beetles,
instantly adapt their mode of locomotion to the amputation of a leg or
indeed of any particular combination of legs. Bethe argued that these
improvised equipotential co-ordinations are so varied that they cannot
be due to the action of predetermined anatomic paths.16 He thought they
manifested a capacity of the nervous system to reorganize itself
adaptively.</p>
<p>This process of spontaneous adaptive reorganization, by which a
predetermined end is achieved under profoundly modified conditions,
finds an important parallel in the process of embryonic development. The
fragments detached from embryos of certain lower animals have the
capacity of regenerating the whole embryo and of producing normal
individuals. This ontogenetic principle was first discovered by H.
Driesch in the embryo of the sea urchin. Throughout its cleavage stage
any cell or combination of cells detached from the embryo will develop
into a normal sea urchin. Driesch characterized these regenerative
powers of an embryo by describing it as an ‘harmonious equipotential’
system. The capacity of the germ to build up a normal embryo in spite of
severe amputations is more widely referred to today as ‘morphogenetic
regulation’.</p>
<p>I shall speak later of another principle of ontogenesis, operating by
locally fixed potentialities, and of the combination of this mosaic
principle with the equipotential reorganization of embryonic fragments.
For the moment it is enough to observe that the powers of improvisation,
discovered by Driesch in embryonic fragments, have proved up to this day
just as inexplicable in terms of fixed anatomical structures as have the
powers of functional regeneration manifested throughout the animal
kingdom—from the amputated centipede to the paralysed Renoir.17</p>
<p>The continuity between heuristics and morphogenetic equipotentiality
can now be outlined in more specific terms. We start from the fact that
no material process governed by the laws of matter as known today can
conceivably account for the presence of consciousness in material
bodies. I have refused to assume that if we succeeded in revising the
laws of physics and chemistry, so as to account for the sentience of
animals and men, these would still appear to us as automata—with the
super-added absurdity of a totally ineffectual mental life accompanying
their automatic performances. To represent living men as insentient is
empirically false, but to regard them as thoughtful automata is logical
nonsense. For we are aware of a man’s thoughts only by listening to him,
i.e. by attending subsidiarily to certain bodily actions in the
assumption that they are impelled by his thoughts, which are in fact
known to us only as the effective centre of his meaningful actions. Nor
can we speak therefore of thinking which totally lacks originality and
responsibility; or indeed, envisage another person’s considered judgment
without acknowledging its universal intent, which challenges us to
follow or contradict it. These features are essential to our
pre-scientific conception of thought, and neurology cannot be said to
account for thinking unless it represents it as something in which these
features are still recognizable.</p>
<p>A big step towards the generalization of the powers of thought
downwards in the direction of morphogenetic originality is made by
acknowledging the originative powers of unconscious thought. The
unconscious exercise of originality is usually still prompted by a
conscious effort and a judgment of a high order, as in the case of the
heuristic efforts which induce discovery during a subsequent period of
latency. An effort will usually be also at work in causing the
reorganization of available means for a pre-determined end.</p>
<p>Ultimately, by dropping also the element of effort, the capacity for
coherent and resourceful action can be generalized to a process of
growth. The principle of equipotentiality is thus equated to the
acknowledgment that we cannot identify the phenomenon discovered by
Driesch, except by crediting any fragment whatever of the early
sea-urchin embryo with the capacity to grow into a complete individual.
This is a capacity for utilizing indeterminate means for achieving a
comprehensive feature that we deem to be right, and it can be envisaged
only by acknowledging this instrumental relationship in these terms. It
foreshadows, therefore, to this extent the kind of faculty which enabled
Renoir to continue painting after he was paralysed, and beyond that, the
whole range of personal judgment and originality which we acknowledge
when properly attending to a thoughtful person. The morphogenetic
principle discovered by Driesch thus reveals itself as the primordial
member of an ascending series of homologous processes, which cannot be
understood except as the resourceful achievement of a comprehensive
rightness, and every one of which dissolves altogether in the light of
any more impersonal examination.</p>
