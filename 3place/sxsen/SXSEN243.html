<h4 id="probability">Probability</h4>
<p>Set theory and measure theory during the twentieth century invaded an
ever-widening portion of mathematics, and few branches have been as
thoroughly influenced by the trend as has the theory of probability, to
which Borel had contributed his E´lements de la theorie des probabilit´
es´ (1909). The opening year of the new century was auspicious for
probability, both in physics and in genetics, for in 1901, Josiah
Willard Gibbs published his Elementary Principles in Statistical
Mechanics, and in the same year, Biometrika was founded by Karl Pearson
(1857 1936). Francis Galton (1822 1911), a precocious cousin of Charles
Darwin and a born statistician, had studied regression phenomena; in
1900, Pearson, the Galton Professor of Eugenics at the University of
London, had popularized the chi-square test. One of Poincare’s titles
had been´ “Professor of the Calculus of Probabilities,” indicating the
rising interest in the subject.</p>
<p>InRussia,thestudyoflinkedchainsofeventswasinitiated,especiallyin 1906
1907,byA.A.Markov(1856 1922),astudentofChebyshev’sand the coeditor of
his teacher’s Oeuvres (2 vols., 1899 1904). In the kinetic theory of
gases and in many social and biological phenomena, the probability of an
event often depends on preceding outcomes, and especially since the
middle of the twentieth century, Markov chains of linked probabilities
have been widely studied. As mathematical foundations for the expanding
theory of probability were sought, statisticians found the appropriate
tool at hand, and today no rigorous presentation of probability theory
is possible without using the notions of measurable functions and modern
theories of integration. In Russia, for example, Kolmogorov made
important advances in Markov processes (1931) and satisfied in part
Hilbert’s sixth project, calling for axiomatic foundations of
probability, through the use of Lebesgue measure theory. Classical
analysis had been concerned with continuous functions, whereas
probability problems generally involve discrete cases. Measure theory
and the extensions of the integration concept were ideally suited to
bring about a closer association
ofanalysisandprobability,especiallyafterthemiddleofthecentury,when
Laurent Schwartz (1915 2002) of Nancy and Paris generalized the concept
of differentiation through the theory of distributions (1950 1951).</p>
<p>The Dirac delta function of atomic physics had shown that the
pathological functions that had long occupied mathematicians were also
useful in science. In the more difficult cases, however,
differentiability breaks down, with resulting problems in the solution
of differential equations—one of the chief connecting links between
mathematics and physics, especially where singular solutions are
involved. To surmount this difficulty, Schwartz introduced a broader
view of differentiability, one made possible by the development, in the
first half of the century, of general vector spaces by Stefan Banach
(1892 1945), Frechet, and´ others. A linear vector space is a set of
elements a, b, c,…satisfying certain conditions, especially including
the requirement that if a and b are elements of L, and if α and β are
complex numbers, then αa1 βb is an element of L. If the elements of L
are functions, the linear vector</p>
<p>B ound s and A ppr o x imat ions</p>
<p>space is called a linear space, and a mapping of this case is called
a linear functional. By a “distribution,” Schwartz meant a linear and
continuous functional on the space of functions that are differentiable
and that satisfy certain other conditions. The Dirac measure, for
example, is a special case of a distribution. Schwartz then developed an
appropriate definition of the derivative of a distribution such that the
derivative of a distribution is always itself a distribution. This
provides a powerful generalization of the calculus, with immediate
applications to probability theory and physics.</p>
<p>Bounds and Approximations</p>
<p>While observing the growth of abstraction and generality during the
early twentieth century, it is easy to overlook the fact that this was
also a period of increased activity in the development of numerical
techniques designed to assist in solving problems that withstood direct
attack with closed form expressions. One of the best-known examples is
the Kutta-Runge method for the solution of differential equations known
since the first decade of the
twentiethcentury.ThestrongestoftheKutta-Rungealgorithmsprovedtobe
superior to many of the more recent competitors that flourished after
numerical analysis gained new prominence because of the advent of
automatic computing. Similarly, numerous approximations and bound
calculations in number theory that were achieved in the first three
decades of the century would be superseded only decades later.</p>
<p>A significant number of studies dealt with bounds for minimal forms,
a subject to whichHermite hadcalled attention;it washe who gave an upper
bound for the minimum of an n-ary form with a given determinant that is
fixed—and to which A. N. Korkin (1837 1908) and Egor Zolotarev (1847
1878) made significant contributions, which in turn inspired Markov, who
had studied with them as well as with Chebyshev at St. Petersburg.
Markov had won a gold medal for a paper on the integration of
differential equations by continued fractions and two years later, in
1880, wrote a highly acclaimed thesis on binary quadratic forms with
positive determinant. Intrigued by the research emanating from the
St. Petersburg group—Markov’s thesis had been published in the
Mathematische Annalen—Frobenius wrote a number of papers that built on
Markov’s work; in addition, several of Frobenius’s students made
important contributions to this area of research. The problem Markov
addressed of finding a lower bound for an indefinite binary quadratic
form provides a goodexample. In several papers published in 1913,
Frobenius showedthat
incontrasttoMarkov,hecouldobtainmostofMarkov’sresultswithoutthe use of
continued fractions. The one case that had eluded Frobenius was
resolvedbyRobertRemak(1888 1942)by1924.InhisstudyofMarkov’s problem,
Issai Schur (1875 1941) in 1913 had relied on minimal forms in a way
that Remak now used, along with Frobenius’s successful results. Having
completely rid the solution of Markov’s problem from continued
fractions, Remak in 1925 first proved strictly arithmetically a number
of related theorems and then provided a geometric interpretation of the
results obtained by Markov, Frobenius, and himself.</p>
<p>Another major impetus to studies of bounds and approximations
emanated from Hermann Minkowski. In his Habilitationsschrift of 1886, he
had discussed minima of positive definite quadratic forms. The notions
found in this work would be elaborated in his Diophantische
Approximationen of 1907 and his posthumous Geometrie der Zahlen (1910).
Edmund Landau (1877 1938), Minkowski’s successor at Go¨tttingen,
although a student of Frobenius’s, was primarily interested in analytic
number theory. In 1903, he produced a simplified proof of the prime
number theorem; in 1909, his magnum opus, a two-volume handbook
concerning the distribution of primes, was published. Yet in 1918, he
was to obtain the first estimation of units and regulators in algebraic
number fields. He used a procedure Remak had developed (without use of
continued fractions) in a 1913 paper that contained numerical bounds for
the equation t2 2Du251, along with Minkowski’s theorem concerning linear
forms. Landau, like Minkowski before him, did not shy away from using
ideal theory in these studies. Neither did he avoid analytic supports
where necessary; thus, in one of the 1918 papers, he made free use of
the functional equation of Dedekind’s zeta-function that Hecke had
brought forth the previous year. On the other hand, Remak, who would
excel in the estimation of units and regulators in the years to come,
strove for purely arithmetic proofs and eschewed idealtheoretic, as well
as analytic tools.</p>
<p>Three men who freely used analytic tools were G. H. Hardy (1877</p>
<p>1947), J. E. Littlewood (1885 1977), and the autodidactic Indian
genius Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887 1920). In the second decade of the
century, Hardy and Littlewood began their well-known collaboration on
numerical partitions. During the time that he spent with them in
England, Ramanujan and Hardy produced a joint paper on asymptotic values
of p(n), where p(n) is the number of partitions of an integer n into
summands. Ramanujan had previously made a number of conjectures
concerning p(n), based on numerical data for small n; he had also proved
some of his guesses using elliptic functions. In the joint paper, he
suggested an asymptotic formula for p(n) that, as Hans Rademacher (1892
1969) would subsequently prove, actually led to an exact value for
n.</p>
<p>The activities just outlined are of interest not only for the
specific results they produced but because of the competition among the
various participants to demonstrate the superiority, or at least the
usefulness, of their particular technique, whether arithmetic,
algebraic, analytic—singly or in combination. This would eventually shed
additional light on many underlying structural relationships.</p>
<p>T he 1930 s and Wor ld War II</p>
<p>The1930s andWorldWar II</p>
<p>The rise to power of Hitler and the National Socialist Party in
Germany precipitated a catastrophe that soon affected mathematical
institutions around the world. In the spring of 1933, numerous
professors were dismissed from German universities. This and the
subsequent more serious actions taken against individuals of Jewish
background or opposing political beliefs resulted in a vast migration of
scholars from Germany or German-occupied countries, as well as in the
deaths of many who remained. It also resulted in the diminution of some
of the most established mathematical centers of Western and Central
Europe. Attempted purges of mathematicians in the Soviet Union similarly
stifled growth in a number of the younger centers of activity. Some of
the most severe institutional and individual losses occurred in Poland
with the closing of the universities after 1939, the destruction of the
University of Warsaw’s mathematical collections, the deportation of
nearly 200 faculty members from the Jagellonian University in Krakow,
and the planned killing of professors in Lvov in July 1941.</p>
<p>A substantial number of European mathematicians came to the United
States. Among the best known were Hermann Weyl and the algebraists Emil
Artin, Richard Brauer, and Emmy Noether; the analysts Richard Courant
and Jacques Hadamard; the probability specialist William Feller; the
statistician Jerzy Neyman; the logicians Kurt Go¨del and Alfred Tarski;
and the historian of mathematics Otto Neugebauer, to name but a few.
There were mathematicians not subject to persecution who left
professional life, often at the beginning of their careers, to avoid
institutional or organizational affiliations that were incompatible with
their moral beliefs; a few reemerged after World War II. On the other
hand, recalling only three of the multitude who did not escape,
Hausdorff committed suicide to avoid deportation; Otto Blumenthal,
Hilbert’s first Ph.D. student, died in Theresienstadt; and Stanislaw
Saks, the noted contributor to twentieth-century integration theory, was
killed in Warsaw.</p>
<p>The relocation of mathematicians who found refuge resulted in the
infusion of new ideas in many mathematical centers. This presented a
challenge both to those confronted with new concepts and those
attempting to superimpose them on existing systems. Mathematicians were
equally challenged by new problems encountered in World War II.
Especially important at that time were the needs in applied mathematics.
Table computations and the methodology of operations research are but
two examples of areas that redirected the attention of many
mathematicians who had been trained in entirely different fields.
Nevertheless, most of the enormous development during the twenty years
following World War II was spurred on by problems within pure
mathematics itself, yet within the same period, the applications of
mathematics to science multiplied exceedingly.</p>
