<h4 id="trigonometry">Trigonometry</h4>
<p>The first book of De Triangulis, composed about 1464, opens with
fundamental notions, derived largely from Euclid, on magnitudes and
ratios; then there are more than fifty propositions on the solution of
triangles, using the properties of right triangles. Book II begins with
a clear statement and proof of the law of sines and then includes
problems on determining sides, angles, and areas of plane triangles when
given determinate conditions. Among the problems, for example, is the
following: if the base of a triangle and the angle opposite are known,
and if either the altitude to the base or the area is given, then the
sides can be found. Book III contains theorems of the sort found in
ancient Greek texts on “spherics” before the use of trigonometry; Book
IV is on spherical trigonometry, including the spherical law of
sines.</p>
<p>The use of area “formulas,” written out in words, was among the
novelties in Regiomontanus’s De Triangulis, but in the avoidance of the
tangent function, the work falls short of al-Tusi’s (Nasir Eddin’s)
treatment. The tangent function nevertheless was included in another
trigonometric treatise by Regiomontanus—Tabulae Directionum.</p>
<p>Revisions of Ptolemy had suggested the need for new tables, and these
were supplied by a number of fifteenth-century astronomers, of whom
Regiomontanus was one. In order to avoid fractions, it was customary to
adopt a large value for the radius of the circle, or the sinus totus.
For one of his sine tables, Regiomontanus followed his immediate
predecessors in using a radius of 600,000; for others, he adopted
10,000,000 or 600,000,000. For his tangent table in Tabulae Directionum,
he chose 100,000. He does not call the function “tangent” but uses only
the word “numerus” for the entries, degree by degree, in a tabulation
headed “Tabula fecunda” (“Productive Table”). The entry for 89 is
5,729,796, and for 90 it is simply infinite.</p>
<p>The sudden death of Regiomontanus occurred before his two
trigonometric works were published, and this considerably delayed their
effect. The Tabulae Directionum was published in 1490, but the more
important treatise, De Triangulis, appeared in print only in 1533 (and
again in 1561). Nevertheless, the works were known in manuscript form to
the circle of mathematicians in Nuremberg, where Regiomontanus was
working, and it is very likely that they influenced work of the early
sixteenth century.</p>
<h2 id="algebra">Algebra</h2>
<p>A general study of triangles led Regiomontanus to consider problems
of geometric construction somewhat reminiscent of Euclid’s Division of
Figures. For example, one is asked to construct a triangle given one
side, the altitude to this side, and the ratio of the other two sides.
Here, however, we find a striking departure from ancient customs:
whereas Euclid’s problems invariably had been given in terms of general
quantities, Regiomontanus gave his lines specific numerical values, even
where he intended that his methods should be general. This enabled him
to make use of the algorithmic methods developed by Arabic algebraists
and</p>

oneoftheunknownsidescanbeexpressedasarootofaquadraticequation with known
numerical coefficients, and this root is constructible by devices
familiar from Euclid’s Elements or al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra. (As
Regiomontanus expressed it, he let one part be the “thing” and then
solved by the rule of “thing” and “square”—that is, through quadratic
equations.) Another problem in which Regiomontanus called for the
construction of a cyclic quadrilateral, given the four sides, can be
handled similarly.</p>
<p>TheinfluenceofRegiomontanusinalgebrawasrestrictednotonlybyhis
adherence to the rhetorical form of expression and by his early death;
his manuscripts, on his death, came into the hands of his Nuremberg
patron, who failed to make the work effectively accessible to posterity.
Europe learned its algebra painfully and slowly from the thin Greek,
Arabic, and Latin traditions that trickled down through the
universities, the church scribes, rising mercantile activities, and
scholars from other fields.</p>
<p>Nicolas Chuquet’s Triparty</p>
<p>It was Germany and Italy that provided most of the early Renaissance
mathematicians, but in France in 1484 a manuscript was composed that in
level and significance was perhaps the most outstanding algebra since
the Liber abaci of Fibonacci almost three centuries earlier and that,
like the Liber abaci, was not printed until the nineteenth century. This
work, titled Triparty en la science des nombres, was by Nicolas Chuquet
(1445 1488), about whom we know virtually nothing except that he was
born in Paris, attained his bachelor’s degree in medicine, and practiced
in Lyons. The Triparty does not closely resemble any earlier work in
arithmetic or algebra, and the only writers the author mentions are
Boethius and Campanus. There is evidence of Italian influence, which
possibly resulted from acquaintance with Fibonacci’s Liber abaci.</p>
<p>The first of the “Three Parts” concerns the rational arithmetic
operations on numbers, including an explanation of the Hindu-Arabic
numerals. Of these, Chuquet said that “the tenth figure does not have or
signify a value, and hence it is called cipher or nothing or figure of
no value.” The work is essentially rhetorical, the four fundamental
operations being indicated by the words and the phrases plus, moins,
multiplier par, and partyr par, the first two sometimes abbreviated in
the medieval manner as p and m. In connection with the computation of
averages, Chuquet gave a regle des nombres moyens, according to which
(a1c)/(b1d) lies between a/b and c/d if a, b, c, d are positive numbers.
In the second part, concerning roots of numbers, there is some
syncopation, so that the modern expression 142p180 appears in the not
very dissimilar form R)2.14.m.R)2180.</p>
<p>The last and by far the most important part of the Triparty concerns
the “Regle des premiers,” that is, the rule of the unknown, or what we
should call algebra. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there
were various names for the unknown thing, such as res (in Latin) or
chose (in French) or cosa (in Italian) or coss (in German); Chuquet’s
word “premier” is unusual in this connection. The second power he called
champs (whereas the Latin had been census), the third cubiez, and the
fourth champs de champ. For multiples of these, Chuquet invented an
exponential notation of great significance. The denomination or power of
the unknown quantity was indicated by an exponent associated with the
coefficient of the term, so that our modern expressions 5x and 6x2 and
l0x3 appeared in the Triparty as .5.1 and .6.2 and .10.3. Moreover, zero
and negative exponents take their place along with the positive integral
powers, so that our 9x0 became .9.0, and 9x 2 was written as .9.2.m,
meaning .9. seconds moins. Such a notation laid bare the laws of
exponents, with which Chuquet may have become familiar through the work
of Oresme on proportions. Chuquet wrote, for example, that .72.1 divided
by .8.3 is .9.2.m—that is, 72x48x3 59x 2. Related to these laws is his
observation of the relationships between the powers of the number 2 and
the indices of these powers set out in a table from 0 to 20, in which
sums of the indices correspond to products of the powers. Except for the
magnitude of the gaps between entries, this constituted a miniature
table of logarithms to the base 2. Observations similar to those of
Chuquet were to be repeated several times during the next century, and
these undoubtedly played a role in the ultimate invention of
logarithms.</p>
<p>The second half of the last part of the Triparty is devoted to the
solution of equations. Here are many of the problems that had appeared
among his predecessors’ works, but there is also at least one
significant novelty. In writing.4.1 egaulx a m.2.0 (that is,
4x522),Chuquet wasfor thefirst time expressing an isolated negative
number in an algebraic equation. Generally, he rejected zero as a root
of an equation, but on one occasion, he remarked that the number sought
was 0. In considering equations of the form axm 1bxm1n 5cx m12n (where
the coefficients and the exponents are specific positive integers), he
found that some implied imaginary solutions; in these cases, he simply
added, “Tel nombre est ineperible.”</p>
<p>The Triparty of Chuquet, like the Collectio of Pappus, is a book in
which the extent of the author’s originality cannot be determined. Each
undoubtedly was indebted to his immediate predecessors, but we are
unable to identify any of them. Moreover, in the case of Chuquet, we
cannot determine his influence on later writers. The Triparty was not
printed until 1880 and probably was known to few mathematicians, but one
of those into whose hands it fell used so much of the material that by
modern standards, he might be charged with plagiarism, even though he
mentioned Chuquet’s name. The Larismethique nouvellement composee,
published in Lyons by Etienne de la Roche in 1520 and again in 1538,
depended heavily, as we now know, on Chuquet; hence, it is safe to say
that the Triparty was not without effect.</p>
