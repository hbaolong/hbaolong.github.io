<h4 id="robert-recorde">Robert Recorde</h4>
<p>Mathematics had not prospered in England during the period of almost
two centuries since the death of Bradwardine, and what little work was
done there in the early sixteenth century depended much on Italian
writers such as Pacioli. Recorde was, in fact, just about the only
mathematician of any stature in England during the entire century. He
was born in Wales and studied and taught mathematics at both Oxford and
Cambridge. In 1545, he received his medical degree at Cambridge, and
thereafter he became the physician of Edward VI and Queen Mary. Recorde
virtually established the English mathematical school. Like Chuquet and
Pacioli before him and Galileo after him, he wrote in the vernacular;
this may have limited his effect on the Continent. Recorde’s first
extant mathematical work is the Grounde of Artes (1541), a popular
arithmetic containing computation by abacus and algorism, with
commercial applications. The level and style of this book, dedicated to
Edward VI and appearing in more than two dozen editions, may be judged
from the following problem:</p>
<p>Then what say you to this equation? If I sold unto you an horse
having 4 shoes, and in every shoe 6 nayles, with this condition, that
you shall pay for the first nayle one ob: for the second nayle two ob:
for the third nayle foure ob: and so fourth, doubling untill the end of
all the nayles, now I ask you, how much would the price of the horse
come unto?</p>
<p>His Castle of Knowledge, an astronomy in which the Copernican system
is cited with approval, and his Pathewaie to Knowledge, an abridgement
of the Elements and the first geometry to appear in English, both
appeared in 1551. The work of Recorde that is most often cited is The
Whetstone of Witte, published only a year before he died in prison. The
title Whetstone evidently was a play on the word “coss,” for “cos” is
the Latin for “whetstone,” and the book is devoted to “the cossike
practise” (that is, algebra). It did for England what Stifel had done
for Germany—with one addition. The well-known equality sign first
appeared in it, explained by Recorde in the quotation at the beginning
of this chapter. Yet it was to be a century or more before the sign
triumphed over rival notations. Recorde died in the year in which Queen
Mary also died, and no comparable English mathematical author appeared
during the long reign of Elizabeth I. It was France, rather than
England,</p>
<p>Tr igonome tr y</p>
<p>Germany, or Italy, that produced the outstanding mathematician of the
Elizabethan Age. But before we turn to his work, there are certain
aspects of the earlier sixteenth century that should be clarified.</p>
