<h4 id="axioms-of-arithmetic">Axioms of Arithmetic</h4>
<p>Mathematics has often been likened to a tree, for it grows through an
ever more widely spreading and branching structure above ground, while,
at the same time, it sinks its roots ever deeper and wider in the search
for a firm foundation. This double growth was especially characteristic
of the development of analysis in the nineteenth century, for the rapid
expansion of the theory of functions had been accompanied by the
rigorous arithmetization of the subject from Bolzano to Weierstrass. In
algebra, the nineteenth century had been more notable for new
developments than for attention to foundations, and Peacock’s efforts to
provide a sound</p>
<p>A x ioms of Ar i t hme t ic</p>
<p>basis were feeble in comparison with the precision of Bolzano in
analysis. During the closing years of the century, however, there were
several efforts to provide stronger roots for algebra. The complex
number system is defined in terms of the real numbers, which are
explained as classes of rational numbers, which in turn are ordered
pairs of integers. But what, after all, are the integers? Everyone
thinks that he or she knows, for example, what the number 3 is—until he
or she tries to define or explain it—and the idea of equality of
integers is assumed to be obvious. Not satisfied to leave the basic
concepts of arithmetic, hence of algebra, in so vague a state, the
German logician and mathematician F.L.G. Frege (1848 1925) was led to
his well-known definition of a cardinal number. The basis for his views
came from the theory of sets of Boole and Cantor. It will be recalled
that Cantor had regarded two infinite sets as having the same “power” if
the elements of the sets can be put into one-to-one correspondence.
Frege saw that this idea of the correspondence of elements is also basic
in the notion of equality of integers. Two finite sets are said to have
the same cardinal number—that is, to be equal—if the elements in either
class can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the elements in the
other. If, then, one were to begin with an initial set, such as the set
of fingers on the normal human hand, and were to form the much more
comprehensive set of all sets the elements of which can be put into
one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the initial set, then
this set of all such sets would constitute a cardinal number, in this
case the number 5. More generally, Frege’s definition of the cardinal
number of a given class, whether finite or infinite, is the class of all
classes that are similar to the given class (where by “similar,” one
means that the elements of the two classes in question can be placed in
one-to-one correspondence).</p>
<p>Frege’s definition of a cardinal number appeared in 1884 in a
wellknown book, Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik (The Foundations of
Arithmetic), and fromthe definition, he derived the properties of the
whole numbers that are familiar in grade-school arithmetic. During the
succeeding years, Frege amplified his views in the two-volume
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic), the first volume
of which appeared in 1893 and the second, ten years later. As the second
volume was in press, however, Frege received a letter from Bertrand
Russell informing him of the paradox concerning the class of all classes
that are not members of themselves. Frege, recognizing the implication
for his definition of cardinal numbers and the entire work he had just
completed, appended a note to his volume commenting on the blow to a
scholar when the foundation of an entire structure he has established is
pulled out from underneath.</p>
<p>Frege undertook to derive the concepts of arithmetic from those of
formal logic, for he disagreed with the assertion of C. S. Peirce that
mathematics and logic are clearly distinct. Frege had been educated at
the universities of Jena and Go¨ttingen, and he taught at Jena during a
long career. Nevertheless, his program did not meet with much response
until it was undertaken independently early in the twentieth century by
Bertrand Russell, when it became one of the chief goals of
mathematicians. Frege was keenly disappointed by the poor reception of
his work, but the fault lay in part in the excessively novel and
philosophical form in which the results were cast. History shows that
novelty in ideas is more readily accepted if couched in a relatively
conventional form.</p>
<p>Italy had taken a somewhat less active part in the development of
abstract algebra than had France, Germany, and England, but during the
closing years of the nineteenth century, there were Italian
mathematicians who took a deep interest in mathematical logic. Best
known of these was Giuseppe Peano (1858 1932), whose name is recalled
today in connection with the Peano axioms on which so many rigorous
constructions of algebra and analysis depend. His aim was similar to
that of Frege, but it was at the same time more ambitious and yet more
down to earth. He hoped, in his Formulaire de mathe´matiques (1894 et
seq.), to develop a formalized language that should contain not only
mathematical logic but all of the most important branches of
mathematics. That his program attracted a large circle of collaborators
and disciples resulted in part from his avoidance of metaphysical
language and from his felicitous choice of symbols—such as A (belongs to
the class of), ,(logical sum or union),-(logical product or
intersection), and</p>
<p>(contains)—many of which are used even today. For his foundations of
arithmetic, he chose three primitive concepts: zero, number (that is,
nonnegative whole number), and the relationship “is the successor of,”
satisfying five postulates:</p>
<p>1.Zero is a number.</p>
<p>2.If a is a number, the successor of a is a number.</p>
<p>3.Zero is not the successor of a number.</p>
<p>4.Two numbers of which the successors are equal are
themselvesequal.</p>
<p>5.If a set S of numbers contains zero and also the successor of every
number in S, then every number is in S.</p>
<p>The last requirement is, of course, the axiom of induction. The Peano
axioms, first formulated in 1889 in Arithmetices principia nova methodo
exposita, represent the most striking attempt of the century to reduce
common arithmetic—hence, ultimately, most of mathematics—to the stark
essentials of formal symbolism. (He expressed the postulates in symbols,
rather than in the words that we have used.) Here the postulational
method attained a new height of precision, with no ambiguity of meaning
and no concealed assumptions. Peano also spent much effort in</p>
<p>A x ioms of Ar i t hme t ic</p>
<p>the development of symbolic logic, a favorite pursuit of the
twentieth century.</p>
<p>A further contribution by Peano to mathematics should perhaps be
mentioned, inasmuch as it represented one of the disquieting discoveries
of the time. The nineteenth century had opened with a recognition that
curves and functions need not be of the well-behaved type that had
theretofore preempted the field, and in 1890, Peano showed how
thoroughly mathematics could outrage common sense when he constructed
continuous space-filling curves, that is, curves given by parametric
equations x5f(t), y5g(t), where f and g are continuous real functions in
the interval 0#t#1, the points of which completely fill the unit square
0#x#1, 0#y#1. This paradox, of course, is all of a piece with Cantor’s
discovery that there are no more points in a unit square than in a unit
line segment, and it was among the factors that caused the following
century to devote much more attention to the basic structure of
mathematics. In 1903, Peano himself, however, was distracted by his
invention of the international language that he called “Interlingua” or
“Latino sine flexione,” with vocabulary drawn from Latin, French,
English, and German. This movement turned out to be far more ephemeral
than his axiomatic structure in arithmetic.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>It is the simple hypotheses of which one must be most wary; because
these are the ones that have the most chances of passing unnoticed.</p>
<p>Poincare´</p>
<p>Berlin and G˛ttingen at Midcentury</p>
<p>Analysis, the study of infinite processes, had been understood by
Newton and Leibniz to be concerned with continuous magnitudes, such as
lengths, areas, velocities, and accelerations, whereas the theory of
numbers has as its domain the discrete set of natural numbers. We have
nevertheless seen that Bolzano tried to give purely arithmetic proofs of
propositions, such as the location theorem in elementary algebra, that
seemed to depend on properties of continuous functions, and Plu¨cker had
thoroughly arithmetized analytic geometry. The theory of groups had
originally been concerned with discrete sets of elements, but Klein
envisioned a unification of both discrete and continuous aspects of
mathematics under the group concept. The nineteenth century was indeed a
period of correlation in mathematics. The geometric interpretation of
analysis and algebra was one aspect of this tendency; the introduction
of analytic techniques in</p>
<p>526</p>
<p>R ie mann in G ˛t t ingen</p>
<p>number theory was another. Toward the end of the century, the
strongest current was that of arithmetization; it affected algebra,
geometry, and analysis.</p>
<p>In 1855, Dirichlet succeeded Gauss in Gottingen. He left in place,
in¨ Berlin, a tradition of lectures on the applications of analysis to
physical problems and number theory. He also left a small group of his
and Jacobi’s friends and students, who continued to influence
mathematics at the academy, in the Journal fu¨r die reine und angewandte
Mathematik, and at the university. In Gottingen, mathematical lectures
were less solidly¨ established. As already noted, Gauss’s limited
teaching had usually emphasized subjects such as the method of least
squares that would be useful to his observatory assistants. Most
mathematics proper was taught by one lecturer, Moritz Stern (1807 1894).
Dirichlet sought to emphasize the “true” Gaussian legacy with lectures
on number theory and potential theory.</p>
<p>There were two young men in Gottingen who were to be profoundly¨
influenced by Dirichlet, although they differed greatly in personality
and mathematical orientation. One was Richard Dedekind; the other,
Bernhard Riemann. When Dirichlet died unexpectedly in 1859, it was
Riemann who succeeded him.</p>
<p>Riemann in G˛ttingen</p>
<p>When Riemann became a professor in Gottingen, he was no stranger to¨
that university. He had matriculated there in 1846, spent several
semesters in Berlin to get his mathematical training from Jacobi and
Dirichlet, then returned to Gottingen, obtained good training in physics
from¨ Wilhelm Weber, assisted Weber, obtained his doctoral degree, and
was appointed lecturer (privatdozent) in 1854. His research, as well as
his career, was split between mathematics and physics. By the time he
succeeded Dirichlet, he had published five memoirs; two of these dealt
with problems in physics. A similar division characterized his later
work, yet, conceptually, it is not the division but the commonality of
many concepts that predominates. Riemann was a many-sided mathematician
with a fertile mind, contributing to geometry, the theory of numbers,
and analysis. Having previously touched on some of his geometric and
function-theoretic work, we shall here cite only the example of his
shortest and possibly most famous paper before proceeding to note his
influence on mathematical physics.</p>
<p>Euler had noted connections between prime number theory and the
series</p>
<p>1 1 1 1</p>
<p>s 1 s 1 s 1 1 s 1 ;</p>
<p>1 2 3 n</p>
<p>where s is an integer—a special case of the Dirichlet series. Riemann
studied the same series for s a complex variable, the sum of the series
defining a function ζðsÞ, which has since been known as Riemann’s zeta
function. One of the tantalizing suggestions that mathematicians have
not yet been able to prove or disprove is the famous Riemann conjecture
that all of the imaginary zeros s5σ1iτ of the zeta function have real
part σ5.</p>
<p>In analysis, Riemann is recalled for his part in the refinement of
the definition of the integral, for emphasis on the Cauchy-Riemann
equations, and for the Riemann surfaces. These surfaces are an ingenious
scheme for uniformizing a function, that is, representing a one-toone
mapping of a complex function that in the ordinary Gaussian plane would
be multivalued. Here we see the most striking aspect of Riemann’s work—a
strongly intuitive and geometric background in analysis that contrasts
sharply with the arithmetizing tendencies of the Weierstrassian school.
His approach has been called “a method of discovery,” whereas that of
Weierstrass was “a method of demonstration.” His results were so
significant that Bertrand Russell described him as “logically the
immediate predecessor of Einstein.” It was Riemann’s intuitive genius in
physics and mathematics that produced such concepts as that of the
curvature of a Riemannian space or manifold, without which the theory of
general relativity could not have been formulated.</p>
