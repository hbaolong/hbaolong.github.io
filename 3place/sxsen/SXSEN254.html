<h4 id="general-bibliography">General Bibliography</h4>
<p>In contrast to the chapter references, this section includes
traditional and recent works in a variety of languages. In general,
books listed here pertain to more than one or two of the chapters in
this book.</p>
<p>Those seeking guidance to further reading should note that in
addition to the following bibliographical references, there are several
periodicals that publish
abstractsofneworrecentpublications.WesingleoutHistoriaMathematica,which
has a comprehensive, concisely annotated listing of recent works in the
history of mathematicsattheend
ofeachissue.Theabstracteditor,AlbertC.Lewis,prepared cumulative author
and subject indexes covering volumes 113. These splendid sources are
found in volume 13, issue 4, and volume 14, issue 1, respectively.
Another readily available source is section 01 of Mathematical Reviews;
in recent years,especially, thishas become veryuseful.
Theannualcumulative bibliography of Isis is still the main source for
publications in the history of science and technology that may not
appear in the more mathematically oriented journals.</p>
<p>For earlier work, May 1973 is very comprehensive and well indexed. It
is heavily based on reviews in Mathematical Reviews and the Jahrbuch
u¨ber Fortschritte der Mathematik. It omits the titles of journal
articles, however; does not always indicate the language of the material
listed; and provides few comments on individual listings. For that
reason, the newcomer to the field is better served by Dauben 1985, which
is very selective but heavily annotated and provides an easy, relatively
portable guide to reading in specific areas and to further
bibliographical sources.</p>
<p>Readers interestedin biographies arewellservedbytheDictionaryof
Scientific Biography (Gillispie 19701980). We do not list here standard
reference works, such as the major “national” biographical dictionaries
found in most libraries, although they often contain useful information
about mathematicians.</p>
<p>633</p>
<p>The Internet provides many new and changing sources of materials.
Although these vary widely in reliability, the reader should be aware of
one of the most trustworthy sites: for years, John J. O’Connor and
Edmund F. Robertson have maintained the MacTutor History of Mathematics
Archive at St. Andrews University. Few reference sources equal it.</p>
<p>The availability of primary source material depends greatly on the
size and scope of the reader’s library. It is usually worthwhile to
browse in the author and serial indexes; even a small library may hold
surprises. In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in
collected or selected works published. Also, there have been more
English-language translations of mathematical authors. For the earlier
periods, numerous English-language editions and translations have been
listed as part of our chapter bibliographies. For other source materials
in the English language, covering broader periods or topics, see
Birkhoff 1973, Calinger 1982, Midonick 1985, Smith 1959, Struik 1986,
and van Heijenoort 1967.</p>
<p>Many students of the history of mathematics are interested in solving
historical problems. This can be approached in two ways. One is to use
the techniques at the disposal of those with whom the problems are
associated historically; the other one is to use present-day methods.
Often, it is instructive to do both. Sometimes the two approaches
coincide. One gains great understanding of our mathematical predecessors
by the historical approach. This is difficult to carry out, however,
particularly for the period preceding Euler. To do so, it is generally
best to go back to the work of the author or the group with whom we
associate the problem. The original source is often not accessible; many
later translations, especially those of the Ancients, tend to distort
the problems by modernizing the language or the notation used by the
original author, a difficulty that is compounded in most modern
secondary accounts. This does not mean one should simply desist from
historical problem solving; rather, one should keep in mind the
differences between a modernized approach and the original and analyze
one’s attacks on the problem accordingly. Conversely, it can be
enjoyable to take theorems or problems from a contemporary textbook and
consider to what extent they would have been meaningful to a
mathematician in a specified period and place of history or how they
might have been solved or proved by a certain group. Better yet, one can
formulate one’s own mathematical statements, proofs, and solutions in
accordance with a historical period or tradition. This is somewhat
analogous to composing a rondo in the style of Mozart and has similar
drawbacks and advantages.</p>
<p>Readers interested in historical problems are referred to three types
of sources. First, there are primary sources; for the last century, at
least, even smaller libraries often contain old textbooks with problems
and examples. Recalling that our textbook tradition of problems dates
back only a little more than a century, we list Gregory 1846 and Scott
1924 in the following bibliography. The former, which is scarce,
illustrates the type of “examples” that supplemented regular textbooks
until after 1850. The latter, more readily available, is a pioneering
example of a “modern” textbook in its use of problems that illustrate
several areas of late-nineteenth-century mathematics. Then, there are
problem collections. Dorrie 1965 and Tietze 1965 are examples of
collections of historical problems. Polya is an example of contemporary
problems, the historical roots of which frequently provide food for
thought. Finally, there are problems linked to historical accounts such
as those in Burton 1985 and Eves 1983. These make clear the relationship
to the source, but the cautionary remarks about modernized adaptations
apply to both.</p>
