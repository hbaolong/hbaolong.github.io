<h4 id="james-gregory">James Gregory</h4>
<p>The binomial theorem for integral powers had been known in Europe at
least since 1527, but Wallis was unable, surprisingly, to apply his
method of interpolation here. It looks as though this result may have
been known to the young Scotsman James Gregory (1638 1675), a
predecessor of Newton who died when he was only thirty-six. Gregory had
evidently come in contact with the mathematics of several countries. His
great-uncle Alexander Anderson (1582 1620?) had edited Vie`te’s works,
and James Gregory had studied mathematics not only at school in
Aberdeen, but also with his older brother, David Gregory (1627 1720). A
wealthy patron had introduced him to John Collins (1625 1683), the
librarian of the Royal Society. Collins was to British mathematicians
what Mersenne had been to the French a generation earlier—the
correspondent extraordinary. In 1663, Gregory went to Italy, where the
patron introduced him to the successors of Torricelli, especially
Stefano degli Angeli (1623 1697). The many works of Angeli, a prote´ge´
of Cardinal Michelangelo Ricci (1619 1682) who had been a close friend
of Torricelli’s, were almost all on infinitesimal methods, with emphasis
on the quadrature of generalized spirals, parabolas, and hyperbolas. It
is likely that it was in Italy that Gregory came to appreciate the power
of infinite series expansions of functions and of infinite processes in
general.</p>
<p>Gregory’s Quadratures</p>
<p>In 1667, Gregory published in Padua a work titled Vera circuli et
hyperbolae quadratura, which contained very significant results in
infinitesimal analysis. For one thing, Gregory extended the Archimedean
algorithm to the quadrature of ellipses and hyperbolas. He took an
inscribed triangle of area a0 and a circumscribed quadrilateral of area
A0; by successively doubling the number of sides of these figures, he
formed the sequence a0, A0, a1, A1, a2, A2, a3, A3,…and showed that an
is the geometric mean of the two terms immediately preceding and An the
harmonic mean of the two preceding terms. Thus, he had two
sequences—that of the inscribed areas and that of the circumscribed
areas—both converging to the area of the conic; he used these to get
very good approximations to elliptic and hyperbolic sectors.
Incidentally, the word “coverage” was here used by Gregory in this sense
for the first time. Through this infinite process, Gregory sought,
unsuccessfully, to prove the impossibility of squaring the circle by
algebraic means. Huygens, regarded as the leading mathematician of the
day, believed that π could be expressed algebraically, and a dispute
arose over the validity of Gregory’s methods. The question of π’s
transcendence was a difficult one, and it would be another two centuries
before it was resolved in Gregory’s favor.</p>
<p>Gregory’s Series</p>
<p>In 1668, Gregory published two more works, bringing together results
from France, Italy, Holland, and England, as well as new discoveries of
his own. One of these, Geometriae Pars Universalis (The Universal Part
of Geometry), was published in Padua; the other, Exercitationes
Geometricae (Geometrical Exercises), in London. As the title of the
first book implies, Gregory broke from the Cartesian distinction between
“geometrical” and “mechanical” curves. He preferred to divide
mathematics into “general” and “special” groups of theorems, rather than
into algebraic and transcendental functions. Gregory did not wish to
distinguish even between algebraic and geometric methods, and,
consequently, his work appeared in an essentially geometric garb that is
not easy to follow. Had he expressed his work analytically, he might
have anticipated Newton in the invention of the calculus, for virtually
all of the fundamental elements were known to him by the end of 1668. He
was thoroughly familiar with quadratures and rectifications and probably
saw that these are the inverses of tangent problems. He even knew the
equivalent of secxdx5ln(secx 1 tanx). He had independently found the
binomial theorem for fractional powers, a result known earlier toÐ
Newton (but as yet unpublished), and he had, through a process
equivalent to successive differentiation, discovered the Taylor series
more than forty years before Taylor published it. The Maclaurin series
for tan x and sec x and for arctan x and arcsec x were all known to him,
but only one of these, the series for arctan x, bears his name. He could
have learned in Italy that the area under the curve y51/(11x2), from x50
to x5x, is arctan x, and a simple long division converts 1/(11x2) to
12x2 1x4 2x6 1 . Hence, it is at once apparent from</p>
<p>Cavalieri’s formula that</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>x dx x3 x5 x7</p>
<p>2 5arctan x5x2 1 2 1 :</p>
<p>0 11x 3 5 7</p>
<p>This result is still known as “Gregory’s series.”</p>
<p>Nic olaus Merc at or and W illiam Br ounc ker</p>
<p>Nicolaus Mercator andWilliam Brouncker</p>
<p>Aresult somewhat analogous to Gregory’s series was derived at about
thesame time by Nicolaus Mercator (1620 1687) and published in his
Logarithmotechnia of 1668. Mercator (real name Kaufmann) was born in
Holstein in Denmark, but he lived in London for a long time and became
one of the first members of the Royal Society. In 1683, he went to
France and designed the fountains at Versailles; he died in Paris four
years later. The first part of Mercator’s Logarithmotechnia is on the
calculation of logarithms by methods stemming from those of Napier and
Briggs; the second part contains various approximation formulas for
logarithms, one of which is essentially that now known as “Mercator’s
series.” From the work of Gregory of St. Vincent, it had been known that
the area under the hyperbola y51/(11x), from x 5 0 to x5x, is ln(l1x).
Hence, using
JamesGregory’smethodoflongdivisionfollowedbyintegration,wehave</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>x dx x 2 3</p>
<p>5ð ð12x1x 2x 1 Þdx5lnð11xÞ</p>
<p>0 11x 0</p>
<p>x x2 x3 x4</p>
<p>5 2 1 2 1 :</p>
<p>1 2 3 4</p>
<p>Mercator took over from Mengoli the name “natural logarithms” for
values that are derived by means of this series. Although the series
bears Mercator’s name, it appears that it was known earlier to both
Hudde and Newton, although not published by them.</p>
<p>During the 1650s and 1660s, a wide variety of infinite methods were
developed, including the infinite continued fraction method for π that
had been given by William Brouncker (1620? 1684), the first president of
the Royal Society. The first steps in continued fractions had been taken
many years prior to this in Italy, where Pietro Antonio Cataldi (1548
1626) of Bologna had expressed square roots in this form. Suchp
expressions are easily obtained as follows: Let 2 be desired and let
x115p2. Then, (x11)2 52 or x2 12x 5 1 or x 5 1/(21x). If, on the
right-hand side, one continues to replace x as often as it appears
by</p>
<p>1/(21x), one finds that</p>
<p>x 1 √–2 1.</p>
<p>2 . . .</p>
<p>Through manipulation of Wallis’s product for 2/π, Brouncker was led
somehow to the expression</p>
<p>1 1</p>
<p>2 . . .</p>
<p>In addition, Brouncker and Gregory found certain infinite series for
logarithms, but these were overshadowed by the greater simplicity of the
Mercator series. It is sad to report, however, that Gregory did not have
an influence commensurate with his achievement. He returned to Scotland
tobecomeaprofessorofmathematics,firstatSt.Andrewsin1668andthen at
Edinburgh in 1674, where he became blind and died a year later. After
histhreetreatisesof1667 1668hadappeared,henolongerpublished,and many of
his results had to be rediscovered by others.</p>
