<h4 id="tenth--and-eleventh-century-highlights">Tenth- and
Eleventh-Century Highlights</h4>
<p>With Abu’l-Wefa, trigonometryassumes a more systematic form in which
such theorems as double and half-angle formulas are proved. Although the
Hindu sine function had displaced the Greek chord, it was nevertheless
the Almagest of Ptolemy that motivated the logical arrangement of
trigonometric results. The law of sines had been known to Ptolemy in
essence and is implied in the work of Brahmagupta, but it is frequently
attributed to Abu’l-Wefa and his contemporary Abu Nasr Mensur because of
their clear-cut formulation of the law for spherical triangles.
Abu’l-Wefa also made up a new sine table for angles differing by , using
the equivalent of eight decimal places. In addition, he contributed a
table of tangents and made use of all six of the common trigonometric
functions, together with relations among them, but his use of the new
functions seems not to have been widely followed in the medieval
period.</p>
<p>Tent h and Ele v ent h Centur y Highlight s</p>
<p>Abu’l-Wefa was a capable algebraist, as well as a trigonometer. He
commented on al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra and translated from the Greek one of
the last great classics—the Arithmetica of Diophantus. His successor
al-Karkhi evidently used this translation to become an Arabic disciple
of Diophantus—but without Diophantine analysis! That is, al-Karkhi was
concerned with the algebra of al-Khwarizmi, rather than with the
indeterminate analysis of the Hindus, but like Diophantus (and unlike
al-Khwarizmi), he did not limit himself to quadratic equations— despite
the fact that he followed the Arabic custom of giving geometric proofs
for quadratics. In particular, to al-Karkhi is attributed the first
numerical solution of equations of the form ax2n 1bxn 5c (only equations
with positive roots were considered), where the Diophantine restriction
to rational numbers was abandoned. It was in just this direction, toward
the algebraic solution (in terms of radicals) of equations of more than
the second degree, that the early developments in mathematics in the
Renaissance were destined to take place.</p>
<p>The time of al-Karkhi—the early eleventh century—was a brilliant era
in the history of Arabic learning, and a number of his contemporaries
deserve brief mention—brief not because they were less capable, but
because they were not primarily mathematicians.</p>
<p>Ibn-Sina (980 1037), better known to the West as Avicenna, was the
foremost scholar and scientist in Islam, but in his encyclopedic
interests, mathematics played a smaller role than medicine and
philosophy. He made a translation of Euclid and explained the
casting-out of nines (which consequently is sometimes unwarrantedly
attributed to him), but he is better remembered for his application of
mathematics to astronomy and physics.</p>
<p>As Avicenna reconciled Greek learning with Muslim thought, so his
contemporary al-Biruni (973 1048) made the Arabs—hence, us—familiar with
Hindu mathematics and culture through his well-known book titled India.
An indefatigable traveler and a critical thinker, he gave a sympathetic
but candid account,including full descriptions of the Siddhantas and the
positional principle of numeration. It is he who told us that Archimedes
was familiar with Heron’s formula and gave a proof of this and of
Brahmagupta’s formula, correctly insisting that the latter applies only
to a cyclic quadrilateral. In inscribing a nonagon in a circle, alBiruni
reduced the problem, through the trigonometric formula for cos3θ, to
solving the equation x3 5113x, and for this, he gave the approximate
solution in sexagesimal fractions as 1;52,15,17,13— equivalent to more
than six-place accuracy. Al-Biruni also gave us, in a chapter on gnomon
lengths, an account of the Hindu shadow reckoning. The boldness of his
thought is illustrated by his discussion of whether the earth rotates on
its axis, a question to which he did not give an answer. (Earlier,
Aryabhata seems to have suggested a rotating earth at the center of
space.)</p>
<p>Al-Biruni also contributed to physics, especially through studies in
specific gravity and the causes of artesian wells, but as a physicist
and a mathematician he was excelled by ibn-al-Haitham (ca. 965 1039),
known to the West as Alhazen. The most important treatise written by
Alhazen was the Treasury of Optics, a book that was inspired by work of
Ptolemy on reflection and refraction and that in turn inspired
scientists of medieval and early modern Europe. Among the questions that
Alhazen considered were the structure of the eye, the apparent increase
in the size of the moon when near the horizon, and an estimate, from the
observation that twilight lasts until the sun is 19 below the horizon,
of the height of the atmosphere. The problem of finding the point on a
spherical mirror at which light from a source will be reflected to the
eye of an observer is known to this day as “Alhazen’s problem.” It is a
“solid problem” in the old Greek sense, solvable by conic sections, a
subject with which Alhazen was quite familiar. He extended Archimedes’
results on conoids by finding the volume generated by revolving about
the tangent at the vertex the area bounded by a parabolic arc and the
axis and an ordinate of the parabola.</p>
