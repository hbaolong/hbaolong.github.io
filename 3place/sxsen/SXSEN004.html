<h4 id="preface-to-the-first-edition">Preface to the First Edition</h4>
<p>Numerous histories of mathematics have appeared during this century,
many of them in the English language. Some are very recent, such as J.
F. Scott’s A History of Mathematics1; a new entry in the field,
therefore, should have characteristics not already present in the
available books. Actually, few of the histories at hand are textbooks,
at least not in the American sense of the word, and Scott’s History is
not one of them. It appeared, therefore, that there was room for a new
book—one that would meet more satisfactorily my own preferences and
possibly those of others.</p>
<p>The two-volume History of Mathematics by David Eugene Smith2 was
indeed written “for the purpose of supplying teachers and students with
a usable textbook on the history of elementary mathematics,” but it
covers too wide an area on too low a mathematical level for most modern
college courses, and it is lacking in problems of varied types. Florian
Cajori’s History of Mathematics3 still is a very helpful reference work;
but it is not adapted to classroom use, nor is E. T. Bell’s admirable
The Development of Mathematics.4 The most successful and appropriate
textbook today appears to be Howard Eves, An Introduction to the History
of Mathematics,5 which I have used with considerable satisfaction in at
least a dozen classes since it first appeared in 1953. I have
occasionally departed from the arrangement of topics in the book in
striving toward a heightened sense of historicalmindedness and have
supplemented the material by further reference to the contributions of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries especially by the use of D. J.
Struik, A Concise History of Mathematics.6</p>
<p>The reader of this book, whether layman, student, or teacher of a
course in the history of mathematics, will find that the level of
mathematical background that is presupposed is approximately that of a
college junior or senior, but the material can be perused profitably
also by readers with either stronger or weaker mathematical preparation.
Each chapter ends with a set of exercises that are graded roughly into
three categories. Essay questions that are intended to indicate the
reader’s ability to organize and put into his own words the material
discussed in the chapter are listed first. Then follow relatively easy
exercises that require the proofs of some of the theorems mentioned in
the chapter or their application to varied situations. Finally, there
are a few starred exercises, which are either more difficult or require
specialized methods that may not be familiar to all students or all
readers. The exercises do not in any way form part of the general
exposition and can be disregarded by the reader without loss of
continuity.</p>
<p>Here and there in the text are references to footnotes, generally
bibliographical, and following each chapter there is a list of suggested
readings. Included are some references to the vast periodical literature
in the field, for it is not too early for students at this level to be
introduced to the wealth of material available in good libraries.
Smaller college libraries may not be able to provide all of these
sources, but it is well for a student to be aware of the larger realms
of scholarship beyond the confines of his own campus. There are
references also to works in foreign languages, despite the fact that
some students, hopefully not many, may be unable to read any of these.
Besides providing important additional sources for those who have a
reading knowledge of a foreign language, the inclusion of references in
other languages may help to break down the linguistic provincialism
which, ostrichlike, takes refuge in the mistaken impression that
everything worthwhile appeared in, or has been translated into, the
English language.</p>
<p>The present work differs from the most successful presently available
textbook in a stricter adherence to the chronological arrangement and a
stronger emphasis on historical elements. There is always the temptation
in a class in history of mathematics to assume that the fundamental
purpose of the course is to teach mathematics. A departure from
mathematical standards is then a mortal sin, whereas an error in history
is venial. I have striven to avoid such an attitude, and the purpose of
the book is to present the history of mathematics with fidelity, not
only to mathematical structure and exactitude, but also to historical
perspective and detail. It would be folly, in a book of this scope, to
expect that every date, as well as every decimal point, is correct. It
is hoped, however, that such inadvertencies as may survive beyond the
stage of page proof will not do violence to the sense of history,
broadly understood, or to a sound view of mathematical concepts. It
cannot be too strongly emphasized that this single volume in no way
purports to present the history of mathematics in its entirety. Such an
enterprise would call for the concerted effort of a team, similar to
that which produced the fourth volume of Cantor’s Vorlesungen iiber
Geschichte der Mathematik in 1908 and brought the story down to 1799. In
a work of modest scope the author must exercise judgment in the
selection of the materials to be included, reluctantly restraining the
temptation to cite the work of every productive mathematician; it will
be an exceptional reader who will not note here what he regards as
unconscionable omissions. In particular, the last chapter attempts
merely to point out a few of the salient characteristics of the
twentieth century. In the field of the history of mathematics perhaps
nothing is more to be desired than that there should appear a latter-day
Felix Klein who would complete for our century the type of project Klein
essayed for the nineteenth century, but did not live to finish.</p>
<p>A published work is to some extent like an iceberg, for what is
visible constitutes only a small fraction of the whole. No book appears
until the author has lavished time on it unstintingly and unless he has
received encouragement and support from others too numerous to be named
individually. Indebtedness in my case begins with the many eager
students to whom I have taught the history of mathematics, primarily at
Brooklyn College, but also at Yeshiva University, the University of
Michigan, the University of California (Berkeley), and the University of
Kansas. At the University of Michigan, chiefly through the encouragement
of Professor Phillip S. Jones, and at Brooklyn College through the
assistance of Dean Walter H. Mais and Professors Samuel Borofsky and
James Singer, I have on occasion enjoyed a reduction in teaching load in
order to work on the manuscript of this book. Friends and colleagues in
the field of the history of mathematics, including Professor Dirk J.
Struik of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Professor Kenneth
O. May at the University of Toronto, Professor Howard Eves of the
University of Maine, and Professor Morris Kline at New York University,
have made many helpful suggestions in the preparation of the book, and
these have been greatly appreciated. Materials in the books and articles
of others have been expropriated freely, with little acknowledgment
beyond a cold bibliographical reference, and I take this opportunity to
express to these authors my warmest gratitude. Libraries and publishers
have been very helpful in providing information and illustrations needed
in the text; in particular it has been a pleasure to have worked with
the staff of John Wiley andandandand Sons. The typing of the final copy,
as well as of much of the difficult preliminary manuscript, was done
cheerfully and with painstaking care by Mrs. Hazel Stanley of Lawrence,
Kansas. Finally, I must express deep gratitude to a very understanding
wife. Dr. Marjorie N. Boyer, for her patience in tolerating disruptions
occasioned by the development of yet another book within the family.</p>
