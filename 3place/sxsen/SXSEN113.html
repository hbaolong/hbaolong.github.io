<h4 id="the-century-of-translation">The Century of Translation</h4>
<p>One cannot absorb the wisdom of one’s neighbors if one cannot
understand their language. The Muslims had broken down the language
barrier to Greek culture in the ninth century, and the Latin Europeans
overcame the language barrier to Arabic learning in the twelfth century.
At the beginning of the twelfth century, no European could expect to be
a mathematician or an astronomer, in any real sense, without a good
knowledge of Arabic, and Europe, during the earlier part of the twelfth
century, could not boast of a mathematician who was not a Moor, a Jew,
or a Greek. By the end of the century, the leading and most original
mathematician came from Christian Italy. The period was one of
transition from an older to a newer point of view. The revival began of
necessity with a spate of translations. At first, these were almost
exclusively from Arabic into Latin, but by the thirteenth century there
were many variants—Arabic to Spanish, Arabic to Hebrew, Greek to Latin,
or combinations such as Arabic to Hebrew to Latin.</p>
<p>It is not easy to tell whether the religious crusades had a positive
influence on the transmission of learning, but it is likely that they
disrupted channels of communication more than they facilitated them. At
all events, the channels through Spain and Sicily were the most
important in the twelfth century, and these were largely undisturbed by
the marauding armies of the crusaders between 1096 and 1272. The revival
of learning in Latin Europe took place during, but probably despite, the
crusades.</p>
<p>There were at the time three chief bridges between Islam and the
Christian world—Spain, Sicily, and the Eastern Empire—and of these the
first was the most important. Yet, not all of the major translators
availed themselves of the Spanish intellectual bridge. For example, the
Englishman Adelard of Bath (ca. 1075 1160) is known to have been in
Sicily and theEastbutseemsnottohavebeeninSpain;itisnotclearhowhehadcome
into contact with Muslim learning. In 1126, Adelard translated
Khwarizmi’s astronomical tables from Arabic into Latin. In 1142, he
produced a major version of the Elements of Euclid, among the earliest
of the mathematical classics to appear in Latin translation from the
Arabic. Adelard’s translation of the Elements did not become very
influential for another
century,butitwasfarfromanisolatedevent.Later(ca.1155),hetranslated
Ptolemy’s Almagest from Greek into Latin.</p>
<p>On the Iberian peninsula, especially at Toledo, where the archbishop
promoted such work, a veritable school of translation was developing.
The city, once a Visigothic capital and later, from 712 to 1085, in
Muslim hands before falling to the Christians, was an ideal spot for the
transfer of learning. In Toledo libraries, there was a wealth of Muslim
manuscripts, and of the populace, including Christians, Mohammedans, and
Jews,</p>
<p>A b ac i s t s and A lgor i s t s</p>
<p>many spoke Arabic, facilitating the interlingual flow of information.
The cosmopolitanism of the translators is evident from some of the
names: Robert of Chester, Hermann the Dalmatian, Plato of Tivoli,
Rudolph of Bruges, Gerard of Cremona, and John of Seville, the last a
converted Jew. These are but a small portion of the men associated with
the translation projects in Spain.</p>
<p>Of the translators in Spain, perhaps the most prolific was Gerard of
Cremona (1114 1187). He had gone to Spain to learn Arabic in order to
understand Ptolemy, but he devoted the rest of his life to translations
from the Arabic. Among these exemplary works was the translation into
Latin of a revised version of Thabit ibn-Qurra’s Arabic edition of
Euclid’s Elements; Gerard’s later translation of the Almagest, through
which Ptolemy came chiefly to be known in the West; and translations of
more than eighty other manuscripts.</p>
<p>Among the works of Gerard was a Latin adaptation of the Algebra of
al-Khwarizmi, but an earlier and more popular translation of the Algebra
had been made in 1145 by Robert of Chester. This, the first translation
of al-Khwarizmi’s treatise (as Robert’s translation of the Koran, a few
years before, had marked another “first”), may be taken as marking the
beginning of European algebra. Robert of Chester returned to England in
1150, but the Spanish work of translation continued unabated through
Gerard and others. The works of al-Khwarizmi were evidently among the
more popular subjects of the time, and the names of Plato of Tivoli and
John of Seville are attached to still other adaptations of the Algebra.
Western Europe suddenly took far more favorably to Arabic mathematics
than it ever had to Greek geometry. Perhaps part of the reason for this
is that Arabic arithmetic and algebra were on a more elementary level
than Greek geometry had been during the days of the Roman republic and
empire. The Romans, however, had never displayed much interest in Greek
trigonometry, relatively useful and elementary though it was, yet Latin
scholars of the twelfth century devoured Arabic trigonometry as it
appeared in astronomical works.</p>
