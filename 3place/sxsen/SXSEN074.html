<h4 id="the-decline-of-greek-mathematics">The Decline of Greek
Mathematics</h4>
<p>The period from Hipparchus to Ptolemy, covering three centuries, was
one in which applied mathematics was in the ascendant. It is sometimes
held that mathematics develops most effectively when in close touch with
the world’s work, but the period we have been considering would argue
for the opposite thesis. From Hipparchus to Ptolemy, there were advances
in astronomy and geography, optics and mechanics, but no significant
developments in mathematics outside of trigonometry. Some attribute the
decline to the inadequacies and difficulties in Greek geometric algebra,
others to the cold breath of Rome. In any event, the period during which
trigonometry and mensuration came to the fore was characterized by a
lack of progress, yet it was precisely these aspects of Greek
mathematics that most attracted the Hindu and Arabic scholars who served
as a bridge to the modern world. Before we turn to these peoples,
however, we must look at the Indian summer of Greek mathematics,
sometimes known as the “Silver Age.”</p>
<p>The period that we consider next, from Ptolemy to Proclus, covers
almost four centuries (from the second to the sixth), but our account is
based in large part on only two chief treatises, mere portions of which
are now extant, as well as on a number of works of lesser
significance.</p>
<p>Nicomachus of Gerasa</p>
<p>It should be recalled that in ancient Greece, the word “arithmetic”
meant the theory of numbers, rather than computation. Often Greek
arithmetic had more in common with philosophy than with what we think of
as mathematics; hence, the subject had played a large role in
Neoplatonism during the Later Alexandrian Age. This had been
particularly true of the Introductio arithmeticae of Nicomachus of
Gerasa, a Neopythagorean who lived not far from Jerusalem about the year
100 CE. The author is sometimes held to be of Syrian background, but
Greek philosophical tendencies certainly predominate in his work. The
Introductio of Nicomachus, as we have it, contains only two books, and
it is possible that this is only an abridged version of what was
originally a more extensive treatise. At all events, the possible loss
in this case is far less to be regretted than the loss of seven books of
the Arithmetica of Diophantus. Nicomachus had, so far as we can see,
little mathematical competence and was concerned only with the most
elementary properties of numbers. The level of the work may be judged
from the fact that the author found it expedient to include a
multiplication table up to ι times ι (that is, 10 times 10).</p>
<p>The Introductio of Nicomachus opens with the anticipated Pythagorean
classification of numbers into even and odd, then into evenly even
(powers of two) and evenly odd (2n p, where p is odd and p. 1 and n. 1)
and oddly even (2 p, where p is odd and p. 1). Prime, composite, and
perfect numbers are defined, and a description of the sieve of
Eratosthenes is included, as well as a list of the first four perfect
numbers (6 and 28 and 496 and 8,128). The work also includes a
classification of ratios and combinations of ratios (ratios of integers
are essential in the Pythagorean theory of musical intervals), an
extensive treatment of figurate numbers (which had loomed so large in
Pythagorean arithmetic) in both two and three dimensions, and a
comprehensive account of the various means (again a favorite topic in
Pythagorean philosophy). As did some other writers, Nicomachus regarded
the number 3 as the first number in the strict sense of the word, for 1
and 2 were really only the generators of the number system. For
Nicomachus, numbers were endowed with such qualities as better or worse,
younger or older, and they could transmit characters, as parents to
their progeny. Despite such arithmetical anthropomorphism as a
background, the Introductio contains a moderately sophisticated theorem.
Nicomachus noticed that if the odd integers are grouped in the pattern
1; 315; 719111; 13115117119;…, the successive sums are the cubes of the
integers. This observation, coupled with the early Pythagorean
recognition that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n2, leads to the
conclusion that the sum of the first n perfect cubes is equal to the
square of the sum of the first n integers.</p>
