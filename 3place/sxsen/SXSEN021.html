<p>Algebra is generous; she often gives more than is asked of her.</p>
<p>—D’Alembert</p>
<p>The Life of Euler</p>
<p>Switzerland was the birthplace of many of the leading figures in the
mathematics of the early eighteenth century, and the most significant
mathematician to come from Switzerland during that time—or any time—was
Leonhard Euler (1707–1783).</p>
<p>Euler’s father was a clergyman who, like Jacques Bernoulli’s father,
hoped that his son would enter the ministry. The young man, however,
studied under Jean Bernoulli and associated with his sons, Nicolaus and
Daniel, and through them discovered his vocation. Euler was broadly
trained, for to the study of mathematics he added theology, medicine,
astronomy, physics, and oriental languages. This breadth stood him in
good stead when, in 1727, he heard from Russia that there was an opening
in medicine in the St. Petersburg Academy, where the young Bernoullis
had gone as professors of mathematics. On the recommendation of the
Bernoullis, two of the brightest luminaries in the early days of the
Academy, Euler was called to be a member of the section on medicine and
physiology.</p>
<p>In 1730, Euler found himself in the chair of natural philosophy,
rather than in the medical section. His friend Nicolaus Bernoulli had
died, by drowning, in St. Petersburg the year before Euler arrived, and
in 1733, Daniel Bernoulli left Russia to occupy the chair in mathematics
at Basel. Thereupon Euler, at the age of twenty-six, became the
Academy’s chief mathematician. The St. Petersburg Academy had
established a research journal, the Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum
Imperialis Petropolitanae, and almost from the start, Euler contributed
a spate of mathematical articles. It was said by the French academician
François Arago that Euler could calculate without any apparent effort,
“just as men breathe, as eagles sustain themselves in the air.” As a
result, Euler composed mathematical memoirs while playing with his
children. In 1735, he had lost the sight of his right eye, but this
misfortune in no way diminished the rate of output of his research. He
is supposed to have said that his pencil seemed to surpass him in
intelligence, so easily did memoirs flow. He published more than 500
books and papers during his lifetime. For almost half a century after
his death, works by Euler continued to appear in the publications of the
St. Petersburg Academy. A bibliographical list of Euler’s works,
including posthumous items, contains 886 entries, and it is anticipated
that his collected works (including his correspondence), now being
published under Swiss auspices, will run to 82 substantial volumes. His
mathematical research averaged about 800 pages a year; no mathematician
has ever exceeded the output of this man whom Arago characterized as
“Analysis Incarnate.”</p>
<p>Early on, Euler acquired an international reputation. Even before
leaving Basel, he had received an honorable mention from the Parisian
Académie des Sciences for an essay on the masting of ships. In later
years, he frequently entered essays in the contests set by the Académie,
and twelve times he won the coveted biennial prize. The topics ranged
widely, and on one occasion, in 1724, Euler snared with Maclaurin and
Daniel Bernoulli a prize for an essay on the tides. (The Paris prize was
won twice by Jean Bernoulli and ten times by Daniel Bernoulli.) Euler
was never guilty of false pride, and he wrote works on all levels,
including textbook material for use in the Russian schools. He generally
wrote in Latin and sometimes in French, although German was his native
tongue. Euler had unusual language facility, as one should expect of a
person with a Swiss background. This was fortunate, for one of the
distinguishing marks of eighteenth-century mathematics was the readiness
with which scholars moved from one country to another, and here Euler
encountered no language problems. In 1741, Euler was invited by
Frederick the Great to join the Berlin Academy, and the invitation was
accepted. Euler spent twenty-five years at Frederick’s court, and he
submitted numerous papers to the St. Petersburg Academy, as well as to
the Prussian Academy.</p>
<p>Euler spent almost all of the last seventeen years of his life in
total darkness due to cataracts. Even this tragedy failed to stem the
flood of his research and publication, which continued unabated until in
1783, at the age of seventy-six, he suddenly died while sipping tea and
enjoying the company of one of his grandchildren.</p>
<p>Notation</p>
<p>From 1727 to 1783, the pen of Euler had been busy adding to knowledge
in virtually every branch of pure and applied mathematics, from the most
elementary to the most advanced. Moreover, in most respects Euler, the
most successful notation builder of all times, wrote in the language and
the notations we use today. On his arrival in Russia in 1727, he had
been engaged in experiments in the firing of cannons, and in a
manuscript account of his results, written probably in 1727 or 1728,
Euler had used the letter e more than a dozen times to represent the
base of the system of natural logarithms. The concept behind this number
had been well known ever since the invention of logarithms more than a
century earlier, yet no standard notation for it had become common. In a
letter to Goldbach in 1731, Euler again used his letter e for “that
number whose hyperbolic logarithm = 1.” It appeared in print for the
first time in Euler’s Mechanica of 1736, a book in which Newtonian
dynamics is presented for the first time in analytic form. This
notation, suggested perhaps by the first letter of the word
“exponential,” soon became standard. The definitive use of the Greek
letter π for the ratio of circumference to diameter in a circle is also
largely due to Euler, although a prior occurrence is found in 1706, the
year before Euler was born—in the Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos, or A
New Introduction to the Mathematics, by William Jones (1675–1749). It
was Euler’s adoption of the symbol π in 1737 and later in his many
popular textbooks that made it widely known and used. The symbol i for
is another notation first used by Euler, although in this case the
adoption came near the end of his life, in 1777. This use probably came
so late because in his earlier works, he had used i to represent an
“infinite number,” somewhat as Wallis had used ∞. Thus, Euler wrote ex =
(1 + x/i)i where we should prefer The three symbols e, π, and i, for
which Euler was in large measure responsible, can be combined with the
two most important integers, 0 and 1, in the celebrated equality , which
contains the five most significant numbers (as well as the most
important relation and the most important operation) in all of
mathematics. The equivalent of this equality, in generalized form, had
been included by Euler in 1748 in his best-known textbook, Introductio
in Analysin Infinitorum. The so-called Eulerian constant, often
represented by the Greek letter γ, is a sixth important mathematical
constant, the number defined as a well-known number that has been
calculated to hundreds of decimal places, of which the first ten are
0.5772156649.</p>
<p>It is not only in connection with designations for important numbers
that today we use notations introduced by Euler. In geometry, algebra,
trigonometry, and analysis, we find ubiquitous use of Eulerian symbols,
terminology, and ideas. The use of the small letters a, b, and c for the
sides of a triangle and of the corresponding capitals A, B, and C for
the opposite angles stems from Euler, as does the application of the
letters r, R, and s for the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed
circles and the semiperimeter of the triangle, respectively. The
beautiful formula 4rRs = abc relating the six lengths is also one of the
many elementary results attributed to him, although equivalents of this
result are implied by ancient geometry. The designation lx for logarithm
of x, the use of the now-familiar Σ to indicate a summation, and,
perhaps most important of all, the notation f(x) for a function of x
(used in the Petersburg Commentaries for 1734–1735) are other Eulerian
notations related to ours.</p>
<p>Foundation of Analysis</p>
<p>In evaluating developments in mathematics, we must always bear in
mind that the ideas behind the notations are by far the better half; in
this respect also, the work of Euler was epoch-making. It may fairly be
said that Euler did for the infinite analysis of Newton and Leibniz what
Euclid had done for the geometry of Eudoxus and Theaetetus, or what
Viète had done for the algebra of al-Khwarizmi and Cardan. Euler took
the differential calculus and the method of fluxions and made them part
of a more general branch of mathematics that ever since has been known
as “analysis”—the study of infinite processes. Euler’s Introductio in
Analysin Infinitorum served as a fountainhead for the burgeoning
developments in mathematics during the second half of the eighteenth
century. From this time onward, the idea of “function” became
fundamental in analysis. It had been adumbrated in the medieval latitude
of forms, and it had been implicit in the analytic geometry of Fermat
and Descartes, as well as in the calculus of Newton and Leibniz. The
fourth paragraph of the Introductio defines function of a variable
quantity as “any analytic expression whatsoever made up from that
variable quantity and from numbers or constant quantities.” Today such a
definition is unacceptable, for it fails to explain what an “analytic
expression” is. Euler presumably had in mind primarily the algebraic
functions and the elementary transcendental functions; the strictly
analytic treatment of the trigonometric functions was, in fact, in large
measure established by the Introductio. The sine, for example, was no
longer a line segment; it was simply a number or a ratio—the ordinate of
a point on a unit circle, or the number defined by the series z − z3/3!
+ z5/5! − . . . for some value of z. From the infinite series for ex,
sin x, and cos x, it was a short step to the “Euler identities”</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>relationships that had in essence been known to Cotes and De Moivre
but that in Euler’s hands became familiar tools of analysis.</p>
<p>In 1740, Euler had used imaginary exponents in a letter to Jean
Bernoulli, in which he wrote the familiar Euler identities appeared in
the influential Introductio of 1748. The elementary transcendental
functions—trigonometric, logarithmic, inverse trigonometric, and
exponential—were written and thought of in much the form that they are
treated today. The abbreviations sin., cos., tang., cot., sec., and
cosec. that were used by Euler in the Latin Introductio are closer to
the present English forms than are the corresponding abbreviations in
the Romance languages. Moreover, Euler was among the first to treat
logarithms as exponents, in the manner now so familiar.</p>
<p>Infinite Series</p>
<p>The first volume of the Introductio is concerned from start to finish
with infinite processes—infinite products and infinite continued
fractions, as well as innumerable infinite series. In this respect, the
work is the natural generalization of the views of Newton, Leibniz, and
the Bernoullis, all of whom were fond of infinite series. Yet Euler was
surprisingly unrestrained in his use of such series. Although on
occasion he warned against the risk in working with divergent series, he
himself used the binomial series 1/(1 − x) = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + . . . for
values of x ≥ 1. In fact, by combining the two series x/(1 − x) = x + x2
+ x3 + . . . and x/(x − 1) = 1 + 1/x + 1/x2 + . . ., Euler concluded
that . . . 1/x2 + 1/x + 1 + x + x2 + x3 + . . . = 0.</p>
<p>Despite his hardihood, through manipulations of infinite series Euler
achieved results that had baffled his predecessors. Among these was the
summation of the reciprocals of the perfect squares: 1/12 + 1/22 + 1/32
+ 1/42 + . . . . Oldenburg, in a letter to Leibniz in 1673, had asked
for the sum of this series, but Leibniz failed to answer; in 1689,
Jacques Bernoulli had admitted his own inability to find the sum. Euler
began with the familiar series sin z = z − z3/3! + z5/5! − z7/7! + . .
.. Then, sin z = 0 can be thought of as the infinite polynomial equation
0 = 1 − z2/3! + z4/5! − z6/7! + . . . (obtained by dividing through by
z), or, if z2 is replaced with w, as the equation 0 = 1 − w/3! + w2/5! −
w3/7! + . . .. From the theory of algebraic equations it is known, if
the constant term is 1, that the sum of the reciprocals of the roots is
the negative of the coefficient of the linear term, in this case 1/3!.
Moreover, the roots of the equation in z are known to be π, 2π, 3π, and
so on; hence, the roots of the equation in w are π2, (2π)2, (3π)2, and
so on. Therefore,</p>
<p>Through this carefree application to polynomials of infinite degree
of algebraic rules valid for the finite case, Euler had achieved a
result that had baffled the older Bernoulli brothers; in later years,
Euler repeatedly made discoveries in similar fashion.</p>
<p>Euler’s summation of the reciprocals of the squares of the integers
seems to date from about 1736, and it is likely that it was to Daniel
Bernoulli that he promptly communicated the result. His interest in such
series always was strong, and in later years, he published the sums of
the reciprocals of other powers of the integers. Using the cosine series
instead of the sine series, Euler similarly found the result</p>
<p>hence the corollary summation</p>
<p>Many of these results also appeared in the Introductio of 1748,
including the sums of reciprocals of even powers from n = 2 through n =
26. The series of reciprocals of odd powers are so intractable that it
is still not known whether the sum of the reciprocals of the cubes of
the positive integers is a rational multiple of π3, whereas Euler knew
that for the 26th power, the sum of the reciprocals is</p>
<p>Convergent and Divergent Series</p>
<p>Euler’s imaginative treatment of series led him to some striking
relationships between analysis and the theory of numbers. He showed, in
a relatively easy proof, that the divergence of the harmonic series
implies the Euclidean theorem on the infinitude of primes. If there were
only K primes, that is, p1, p2, . . . , pK, then every number n would be
of the form . Let α be the greatest of the exponents αi for the number n
and form the product</p>
<p>In this product, the terms are bound to appear, as well as others,
hence the product P cannot be smaller than . From the formula for the
sum of a geometric progression, we see that the factors in the product
are respectively smaller than</p>
<p>and so on. Hence,</p>
<p>for all values of n. Therefore, if K, the number of primes, were
finite, the harmonic series would necessarily be convergent. In a
considerably more involved analysis, Euler showed that the infinite
series made up of the reciprocals of the primes is itself divergent, the
sum Sn being asymptotic to ln ln n for increasing values of the integer
n.</p>
<p>Euler delighted in relationships between the theory of numbers and
his rough-and-ready manipulations of infinite series. Heedless of the
dangers lurking in alternating series, he found such results as Here the
sign of a term, after the first two, is determined as follows: If the
denominator is a prime of form 4m + 1, a minus sign is used; if the
denominator is a prime of form 4m − 1, a plus sign is used; and if the
denominator is a composite number, the sign indicated by the product of
the signs of its components is used. Operations on infinite series were
handled with great abandon. From the result ln 1/(1 − x) = x + x2/2 +
x3/3 + x4/4 + . . ., Euler concluded that , hence that where the last
series is made up of all of the reciprocals of primes (in which case,
the terms are taken as negative) and reciprocals of products of two
distinct primes (in which case, the terms are positive). The Introductio
is replete with such series and with related infinite products, such as
and . The symbol ∞ is freely regarded as denoting the reciprocal of the
number 0.</p>
<p>Logarithms and the Euler Identities</p>
<p>To the subject of logarithms, Euler contributed not only the
definition in terms of exponents that we use today, but also the correct
view with respect to the logarithms of negative numbers. The notion that
log(−x) = log(+ x) was upheld by Jean Le Rond d’Alembert, the leading
mathematician in France during the mid-eighteenth century. By 1747,
Euler was able to write to d’Alembert correctly explaining the status of
logarithms of negative numbers. The result should really have been
apparent to Jean Bernoulli and others who were more or less familiar
with the formula even before Euler clearly enunciated it. This identity
holds for all angles (in radian measure); in particular, it leads, for θ
= π, to , that is, to the statement that ln(−1) = πi. Logarithms of
negative numbers therefore are not real, as Jean Bernoulli and
d’Alembert had thought, but pure imaginaries.</p>
<p>Euler also called attention to another property of logarithms that
became apparent from his identity. Any number, positive or negative, has
not one logarithm but infinitely many. From the relationship , one sees
that if ln a = c, then c ± 2Kπi are also natural logarithms of a.
Moreover, from Euler’s identity one sees that logarithms of complex
numbers, real or imaginary, are also complex numbers. If, for example,
one wishes a natural logarithm of a + bi, one writes a + bi = ex + iy.
One obtains ex · eiy = a + bi = ex(cos y + i sin y). The solution of the
simultaneous equations ex cos y = a and ex sin y = b (obtained by
equating real and imaginary parts of the complex equation) yields the
values y = arctan b/a and x = ln(b csc arctan b/a) [or x = ln(a sec
arctan b/a)].</p>
<p>D’Alembert wished to show that the result of any algebraic operation
performed on a complex number is in turn a complex number. In a sense,
Euler did for elementary transcendental operations what d’Alembert tried
to do for algebraic operations. Through the Euler identities, it is not
difficult to find, for example, such quantities as sin (1 + i) or arccos
i, expressed in standard complex-number form. In the former case, one
writes</p>
<p>from which one finds that sin (1 + i) = a + bi, where a = [(1 + e2)
sin 1]/2e and b = [(e2 − 1) cos 1]/2e. In the latter case, one writes
arccos i = x + iy or i = cos(x + iy) or</p>
<p>Equating real and imaginary parts, one sees that cos x = 0 and x = ±
π/2. Hence,</p>
<p>Inasmuch as both x and y must be real, we see that and ). In a
similar manner, one can carry out other elementary transcendental
operations on complex numbers, the results being complex numbers. That
is, the work of Euler showed that the system of complex numbers is
closed under the elementary transcendental operations.</p>
<p>Euler similarly showed that, surprisingly, an imaginary power of an
imaginary number can be a real number. In a letter to Christian Goldbach
(1690–1764) in 1746, he gave the remarkable result . From eiθ = cos θ +
i sin θ we have, for θ = π/2, eπi/2 = i; hence,</p>
<p>There are, in fact, infinitely many real values for ii, as Euler
later showed, given by , where K is an integer. In the Memoirs of the
Berlin Academy for 1749, Euler showed that any complex power of a
complex number, (a + bi)c + di, can be written as a complex number p +
qi. This aspect of Euler’s work was overlooked, and the real values of
ii had to be rediscovered in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Differential Equations</p>
<p>Euler was, without any doubt, the individual most responsible for
methods used today in introductory college courses in the solution of
differential equations, and even many of the specific problems appearing
in current textbooks can be traced back to the great treatises Euler
wrote on the calculus—Institutiones Calculi Differentialis (Petersburg,
1755) and Institutiones Calculi Integralis (Petersburg, 1768–1770, 3
vols.). The use of integrating factors, the systematic methods of
solving linear equations of higher order with constant coefficients, and
the distinction between linear homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations
and between particular and general solutions are among his contributions
to the subject, although on some points credit must be shared with
others. Daniel Bernoulli, for example, had solved the equation y″ + Ky =
f(x) independently of Euler and at about the same time in 1739–1740, and
d’Alembert, as well as Euler, had general methods, in about 1747, for
solving complete linear equations.</p>
<p>The solution of ordinary differential equations had, in a sense,
begun as soon as the inverse relationship between differentiation and
integration had been recognized. But most differential equations cannot
easily be reduced to simple quadratures, requiring instead ingenious
substitutions or algorithms for their solution. One of the achievements
of the eighteenth century was the discovery of groups of differential
equations that are solvable by means of fairly simple devices. One of
the interesting differential equations of the eighteenth century is the
so-called Riccati equation: y′ = p(x)y2 + q(x)y + r(x). It was Euler who
first called attention to the fact that if a particular solution v =
f(x) is known, then the substitution y = v + 1/z converts the Riccati
equation into a linear differential equation in z, so that a general
solution can be found. In the Petersburg Commentarii for 1760–1763,
Euler also pointed out that if two particular solutions are known, then
a general solution is expressible in terms of a simple quadrature. To
some extent, our ubiquitous indebtedness to Euler in the field of
differential equations is betokened in the fact that a type of linear
equation with variable coefficients bears his name. The Euler equation
xny(n) + a1xn−1y(n−1) + . . . + any(0) = f(x) (where exponents included
within parentheses indicate orders of differentiation) is easily
reduced, through the substitution x = e′, to a linear equation having
constant coefficients. Euler also made progress in partial differential
equations, which were still a field for pioneers, by giving for the
equation the solution u = f(x + at) + g(x − at).</p>
<p>Euler’s four volumes of Institutiones contain by far the most
exhaustive treatment of the calculus up to that time. Besides the
elements of the subject and the solution of differential equations, we
find such things as “Euler’s theorem on homogeneous functions,” namely,
if f(x, y) is homogeneous of order n, then xfx + yfy = nf; a development
of the calculus of finite differences; standard forms for elliptic
integrals; and the theory of the beta and gamma (or factorial) functions
based on the “Eulerian integrals” and and related through such formulas
as Wallis had anticipated some of the properties of these integrals, but
through Euler’s organization, these higher transcendental functions
became an essential part of advanced calculus and of applied
mathematics. About a century later, the integral in the beta function
was generalized by Pafnuty L. Chebyshev (1821–1894), who demonstrated
that the “Chebyshev integral” ∫xp(1 − x)q dx is a higher transcendental
function unless p or q or p + q is an integer.</p>
<p>Probability</p>
<p>One characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment was the tendency to
apply to all aspects of society the quantitative methods that had been
so successful in the physical sciences. In this respect, it is not
surprising to find both Euler and d’Alembert writing on problems of life
expectancy, the value of an annuity, lotteries, and other aspects of
social science. Probability, after all, had been among the chief
interests of Euler’s friends Daniel and Nicolaus Bernoulli. Among the
lottery problems that he published in the Berlin Academy Memoirs for
1765, the following is one of the simplest. Let n tickets be numbered
consecutively from 1 to n and let three tickets be drawn at random.
Then, the probability that a sequence of three consecutive numbers will
be drawn is</p>
<p>the probability that two consecutive numbers (but not three) will be
drawn is</p>
<p>and the probability that no consecutive numbers will be drawn is</p>
<p>No new concepts are required for the solution, but, as we might
anticipate, Euler contributed to notations here as he had elsewhere. He
wrote that he found it useful to represent the expression</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>a form essentially equivalent to the modern notation</p>
<p>The Theory of Numbers</p>
<p>The theory of numbers has held strong attraction for many of the
greatest mathematicians, such as Fermat and Euler, but no appeal for
others—for example, Newton and d’Alembert. Euler did not publish a
treatise on the subject, but he wrote letters and articles on various
aspects of the theory of numbers. It will be recalled that Fermat had
asserted, among other things, (1) that numbers of the form apparently
are always prime; and (2) that if p is prime and a is an integer not
divisible by p, then ap−1 − 1 is divisible by p. Euler exploded the
first of these conjectures in 1732 through his uncanny ability for
computation, showing that is factorable into 6,700,417 × 641. Today the
Fermat conjecture has been so thoroughly deflated that mathematicians
incline to the contrary opinion—that there are no prime Fermat numbers
beyond the number 65,537 corresponding to n = 4.</p>
<p>Just as Euler, by means of a counterexample, had upset one of
Fermat’s conjectures, so a suggestion made by Euler was disproved in
1966. If n is greater than 2, Euler believed, at least n nth powers are
required to provide a sum that is itself an nth power. But it was shown
that the sum of only four fifth powers can be a fifth power, for 275 +
845 + 1105 + 1335 = 1445. It should be noted, however, that in the
latter case, it required two centuries and the services of a high-speed
computing device to provide the counterexample.</p>
<p>For the second of Fermat’s conjectures, known as Fermat’s lesser
theorem, Euler was the first one to publish a proof (although Leibniz
had left an earlier demonstration in manuscript). Euler’s proof, which
appeared in the Petersburg Commentarii for 1736, is so surprisingly
elementary that we describe it here. The proof depends on an induction
on a. If a = 1, the theorem obviously holds. We now show that if the
theorem holds for any positive integral value of a, such as a = k, then
it necessarily holds for a = k + 1. To show this, we use the binomial
theorem to write (k + 1)p as kp + mp + 1, where m is an integer. On
subtracting k + 1 from both sides, we see that (k + 1)p − (k + 1) = mp +
(kp − k). Inasmuch as the last term on the right is divisible by p, by
hypothesis the right-hand side of the equation, hence also the left-hand
side, is obviously divisible by p. The theorem therefore holds, through
mathematical induction, for all values of a, provided that a is prime to
p.</p>
<p>Having proved Fermat’s lesser theorem, Euler demonstrated a somewhat
more general statement in which he used what has been called “Euler’s
ϕ-function.” If m is a positive integer greater than 1, the ϕ(m) is
defined as the number of integers less than m that are prime to m (but
including the integer 1 in each case). It is customary to define ϕ(1) as
1; for n = 2, 3, and 4, for example, the values of ϕ(n) are 1, 2, and 2,
respectively. If p is a prime, then clearly ϕ(p) = p − 1. It can be
proved that</p>
<p>where p1, p2, . . . pr are the distinct prime factors of m. Using
this result, Euler showed that aϕ(m) − 1 is divisible by m if a is
relatively prime to m.</p>
<p>Euler settled two of Fermat’s conjectures but did not dispose of
“Fermat’s last theorem,” although he did prove the impossibility of
integer solutions of xn + yn = zn for the case n = 3.</p>
<p>In 1747, Euler added to the three pairs of amicable numbers known to
Fermat, bringing the list up to thirty pairs; later, he increased this
to more than sixty. Euler also gave a proof that all even perfect
numbers are of the form given by Euclid: 2n−1(2n − 1), where 2n − 1 is
prime. Whether there can be an odd perfect number remains an open
question.</p>
<p>Also unresolved to this day is a question raised in correspondence by
Christian Goldbach (1690–1764). In writing to Euler in 1742, Goldbach
said that every even integer (&gt; 2) is the sum of two primes. This
so-called Goldbach’s theorem appeared in print (without proof) in 1770
in England in the Meditationes Algebraicae of Edward Waring
(1734–1793).</p>
<p>Among other unproved assertions is one known as Waring’s theorem, or
Waring’s problem. Euler had proved that every positive integer is the
sum of not more than four squares; Waring surmised that every positive
integer is the sum of not more than nine cubes or the sum of not more
than nineteen fourth powers. The first half of this bold guess was
proved in the early twentieth century; the second part is still
unproved. Waring also published in the Meditationes Algebraicae a
theorem named for his friend and pupil John Wilson (1741–1793)—if p is a
prime, then (p − 1)! + 1 is a multiple of p.</p>
<p>Textbooks</p>
<p>The leading Continental mathematicians of the mid-eighteenth century
were primarily analysts, but we have seen that their contributions were
not limited to analysis. Euler not only contributed to the theory of
numbers but also composed a popular algebra textbook that appeared in
German and Russian editions at the St. Petersburg Academy in 1770–1772,
in French (under the auspices of d’Alembert) in 1774, and in numerous
other versions, including American editions in English. The
exceptionally didactic quality of Euler’s Algebra is attributed to the
fact that it was dictated by the blind author through a relatively
untutored domestic.</p>
<p>Synthetic geometry was not entirely forgotten on the Continent. Euler
contributed little to the field, despite the fact that today the line
containing the circumcenter, the orthocenter, and the barycenter of a
triangle is known as the Euler line of the triangle. That these centers
of a triangle are collinear seems to have been known earlier to Simson,
whose name has been attached to another line related to a triangle. Such
minor additions to pure geometry pale into insignificance, however, when
compared to Continental contributions to analytic geometry during the
mid-eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>We have described the analytic geometry of Clairaut, especially in
connection with developments in three dimensions, but the material in
the second volume of Euler’s Introductio was more extensive, more
systematic, and more effective. As early as 1728, Euler contributed to
the Petersburg Commentarii papers on the use of coordinate geometry in
three-space, giving general equations for three broad classes of
surfaces: cylinders, cones, and surfaces of revolution. He recognized
that the equation of a cone with its vertex at the origin is necessarily
homogeneous. He also showed that the shortest curve (geodesic) between
two points on a conical surface would become the straight line between
these points if the surface were flattened out into the form of a
plane—one of the earliest theorems concerning developable surfaces.</p>
<p>Euler’s awareness of the significance of making work as general as
possible is especially seen in the second volume of his Introductio.
This book did more than any other to make the use of coordinates, in
both two and three dimensions, the basis of a systematic study of curves
and surfaces. Instead of concentrating on the conic sections, Euler gave
a theory of curves in general, based on the function concept that had
been central in the first volume. Transcendental curves are not given
short shrift, as had been customary, so that here, practically for the
first time, graphical study of trigonometric functions formed a part of
analytic geometry.</p>
<p>The Introductio also includes two accounts of polar coordinates that
are so thorough and systematic that the system frequently, but
erroneously, is attributed to Euler. Whole classes of curves, both
algebraic and transcendental, are considered; for the first time, the
equations for transformations from rectangular to polar coordinates
appear in strictly modern trigonometric form. Moreover, Euler made use
of the general vectorial angle and of negative values for the radius
vector, so that the spiral of Archimedes, for example, appeared in its
dual form, symmetric with respect to the 90° axis. D’Alembert evidently
was influenced by this work when he wrote the article on “Géométrie” for
the Encyclopédie. Euler’s Introductio was also chiefly responsible for
the systematic use of what is called the parametric representation of
curves, that is, an expression of each of the Cartesian coordinates as a
function of an auxiliary independent variable. For the cycloid, for
example, Euler used the form</p>
<p>A long and systematic appendix to the Introductio is perhaps Euler’s
most significant contribution to geometry, for it represents virtually
the first textbook exposition of solid analytic geometry. Surfaces, both
algebraic and transcendental, are considered in general and then are
subdivided into categories. Here we find, evidently for the first time,
the notion that surfaces of the second degree constitute a family of
quadrics in space analogous to the conic sections in plane geometry.
Beginning with the general ten-term quadratic equation f(x, y, z) = 0,
Euler noted that the aggregate of terms of the second degree, when
equated to zero, gives the equation of the asymptotic cone, real or
imaginary. More important, he used the equations for translation and
rotation of axes (in the form that, incidentally, still bears Euler’s
name) to reduce the equation of a nonsingular quadric surface to one of
the canonical forms corresponding to the five fundamental types: the
real ellipsoid, the hyperboloids of one and two sheets, and the elliptic
and hyperbolic paraboloids. The work of Euler comes closer to modern
textbooks than did any other book before the French Revolution.</p>
<p>The Parallel Postulate: Lambert</p>
<p>Many mathematicians, including Euler, have also fancied themselves
philosophers. Euler missed an opportunity that another philosophically
inclined Swiss mathematician tried to exploit. This was Johann Heinrich
Lambert (1728–1777), a Swiss-German writer on a wide variety of
mathematical and nonmathematical themes, who for a couple of years was
an associate of Euler’s at the Berlin Academy. It is said that when
Frederick the Great asked him which science he was most proficient in,
Lambert curtly replied, “All.”</p>
<p>We have seen that Saccheri had believed that he had demolished the
possibilities that the sum of the angles of a plane triangle might be
more or less than two right angles. Lambert called attention to the
well-known fact that on the surface of a sphere, the angle sum of a
triangle is indeed more than two right angles, and he suggested that a
surface might be found on which the triangle angle sum falls short of
two right angles. In trying to complete what Saccheri had attempted—a
proof that denial of Euclid’s parallel postulate leads to a
contradiction—Lambert, in 1766, wrote Die Theorie der Parallellinien,
although this appeared, posthumously, only in 1786. Instead of beginning
with a Saccheri quadrilateral, he adopted as his starting point a
quadrilateral having three right angles (now known as a Lambert
quadrilateral) and then considered for the fourth angle the three
possibilities, namely, that it might be acute, right, or obtuse.
Corresponding to these three cases, he showed, in the manner of
Saccheri, that the angle sum of a triangle would be respectively less
than, equal to, or greater than two right angles. Going beyond Saccheri,
he demonstrated that the extent to which the sum falls short of, or
exceeds, two right angles is proportional to the area of the triangle.
In the obtuse-angled case, this situation is similar to a classical
theorem in spherical geometry—that the area of a triangle is
proportional to its spherical excess—and Lambert speculated that the
hypothesis of the acute angle might correspond to a geometry on a novel
surface, such as a sphere of imaginary radius. In 1868, it was shown by
Eugenio Beltrami (1835–1900) that Lambert had indeed been correct in his
conjecture of the existence of some such surface. It turned out to be,
however, not a sphere with an imaginary radius but a real surface known
as a pseudosphere, that is, a surface of constant negative curvature
generated by revolving the tractrix above its axis.</p>
<p>Although Lambert, like Saccheri, tried to prove the parallel
postulate, he seems to have been aware of his lack of success. He
wrote,</p>
<p>Proofs of the Euclidean postulate can be developed to such an extent
that apparently a mere trifle remains. But a careful analysis shows that
in this seeming trifle lies the crux of the matter; usually it contains
either the proposition that is being proved or a postulate equivalent to
it.</p>
<p>No one else came so close to the truth without actually discovering
non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>Lambert is also known today for other contributions. One of these is
the first proof, presented to the Berlin Academy in 1761, that π is an
irrational number. (In 1737, Euler had shown that e is irrational.)
Lambert showed that if x is a nonzero rational number, then tan x cannot
be rational. Inasmuch as tan π/4 = 1, a rational number, it follows that
π/4 cannot be a rational number, hence neither can π. This did not, of
course, dispose of the circle-squaring question, for quadratic
irrationalities are constructible. At about this time, circle-squarers
had become so numerous that the Academy in Paris passed a resolution in
1775 that no purported solutions of the quadrature problem would be
officially examined.</p>
<p>As another of Lambert’s contributions to mathematics, we should
recall that he did for the hyperbolic functions what Euler had done for
the circular functions, providing the modern view and notation.
Comparisons of the ordinates of the circle x2 + y2 = 1 and of the
hyperbola x2 − y2 = 1 had fascinated mathematicians for a century, and
by 1757, Vincenzo Riccati had suggested a development of hyperbolic
functions. It remained for Lambert to introduce the notations sinh x,
cosh x, and tanh x for the hyperbolic equivalents of the circular
functions of ordinary trigonometry and to popularize the new hyperbolic
trigonometry that modern science finds so useful. Corresponding to
Euler’s three identities for sin x, cos x, and eix, there are three
similar relationships for the hyperbolic functions expressed by the
equations</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Lambert also wrote on cosmography, descriptive geometry, map making,
logic, and the philosophy of mathematics, but his influence did not
match that of Euler or of d’Alembert, whose work we shall consider in
the next chapter.</p>
