<h4 id="numbers-and-fractions-sexagesimals">Numbers and Fractions:
Sexagesimals</h4>
<p>As the Akkadians adopted the Sumerian form of writing, lexicons were
compiled giving equivalents in the two tongues, and forms of words and
numerals became less varied. Thousands of tablets from about the time of
the Hammurabi dynasty (ca. 1800 1600 BCE) illustrate a number system
that had become well established. The decimal system, common to most
civilizations, both ancient and modern, had been submerged in
Mesopotamia under a notation that made fundamental the base 60. Much has
been written about the motives behind this change; it has been suggested
that astronomical considerations may have been instrumental or that the
sexagesimal scheme might have been the natural combination of two
earlier schemes, one decimal and the other using the base 6. It appears
more likely, however, that the base 60 was consciously adopted and
legalized in the interests of metrology, for a magnitude of 60 units can
be subdivided easily into halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, sixths,
tenths, twelfths, fifteenths, twentieths, and thirtieths, thus affording
ten possible subdivisions. Whatever the origin, the sexagesimal system
of numeration has enjoyed a remarkably long life, for remnants survive,
unfortunately for consistency, even to this day in units of time and
angle measure, despite the fundamentally decimal form of mathematics in
our society.</p>
<p>Positional Numeration</p>
<p>Babylonian cuneiform numeration, for smaller whole numbers, proceeded
along the same lines as did the Egyptian hieroglyphic, with repetitions
of the symbols for units and tens. Where the Egyptian architect, carving
on stone, might write 59 as , the Mesopotamian scribe could similarly
represent the same number on a clay tablet through fourteen wedge-shaped
marks—five broad sideways wedges or “angle-brackets,” each representing
10 units, and nine thin vertical wedges, each standing for a unit, all
juxtaposed in a neat group as . Beyond the number 59, however, the
Egyptian and Babylonian systems differed markedly. Perhaps it was the
inflexibility of the Mesopotamian writing materials, possibly it was a
flash of imaginative insight that made the Babylonians realize that
their two symbols for units and tens sufficed for the representation of
any integer, however large, without excessive repetitiveness. This was
made possible through their invention, some 4,000 years ago, of the
positional notation—the same principle that accounts for the
effectiveness of our present numeral forms. That is, the ancient
Babylonians saw that their symbols could be assigned values that depend
on their relative positions in the representation of a number. Our
number 222 makes use of the same cipher three times, but with a
different meaning each time. Once it represents two units, the second
time it means two 10s, and finally it stands for two 100s (that is,
twice the square of the base 10). In a precisely analogous way, the</p>
<p>Babylonians made multiple use of such a symbol as . When they
wrote</p>
<p>, clearly separating the three groups of two wedges each, they
understood the right-hand group to mean two units, the next group to
mean twice their base, 60, and the left-hand group to signify twice the
square of their base. This numeral, therefore, denoted 2(60)2 12(60)12
(or 7,322 in our notation).</p>
<p>A wealth of primary material exists concerning Mesopotamian
mathematics, but, oddly enough, most of it comes from two periods widely
separated in time. There is an abundance of tablets from the first few
hundred years of the second millennium BCE (the Old Babylonian age), and
many tablets have also been found dating from the last few centuries of
the first millennium BCE (the Seleucid period). Most of the important
contributions to mathematics will be found to go back to the earlier
period, but one contribution is not in evidence until almost 300 BCE.
The Babylonians seem at first to have had no clear way in which to
indicate an “empty” position—that is, they did not have a zero symbol,
although they sometimes left a space where a zero was intended. This
meant that their forms for the numbers 122 and 7,202 looked very much
alike, for might mean either 2(60)12 or 2(60)2 12. Context in many cases
could be relied on to relieve some of the ambiguity, but the lack of a
zero symbol, such as enables us to distinguish at a glance between 22
and 202, must have been quite inconvenient.</p>
<p>By about the time of the conquest by Alexander the Great, however, a
special sign, consisting of two small wedges placed obliquely, was
invented to serve as a placeholder where a numeral was missing. From
that time on, as long as cuneiform was used, the number , or 2(60)2
10(60)12, was readily distinguishable from , or 2(60)12.</p>
<p>A pp r o x imat ions</p>
<p>The Babylonian zero symbol apparently did not end all ambiguity, for
the sign seems to have been used for intermediate empty positions only.
There are no extant tablets in which the zero sign appears in a terminal
position. This means that the Babylonians in antiquity never achieved an
absolute positional system. Position was only relative; hence, the
symbol could represent 2(60)12 or 2(60)2 12(60) or 2(60)3 12(60)2 or any
one of indefinitely many other numbers in which two successive positions
are involved.</p>
