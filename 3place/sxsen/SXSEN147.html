<h4 id="johannes-kepler">Johannes Kepler</h4>
<p>In his Astronomia nova of 1609, he announced his first two laws of
astronomy: (1) the planets move about the sun in elliptical orbits with
the sun at one focus, and (2) the radius vector joining a planet to the
sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.</p>
<p>In handling problems of areas such as these, Kepler thought of the
area as made up of infinitely small triangles with one vertex at the sun
and the other two vertices at points infinitely close together along the
orbit. In this way, he was able to use a crude type of integral calculus
resembling that of Oresme. The area of a circle, for example, is thereby
found by noting that the altitudes of the infinitely thin triangles
(Fig. 14.4) are equal to the radius. If we call the infinitely small
bases, lying along the circumference, b1, b2, … , bn, … , then the area
of the circle—that is, the sum of the areas of the triangles—will be
12b1r 112b2r 1?112bnr 1? or rðb11b21?1bn1?Þ. Inasmuch as the sum of the
b’s is the circumference C, the area A will be given by A5rC, the
well-known ancient theorem that Archimedes had proved more
carefully.</p>
<p>By analogous reasoning, Kepler knew the area of the ellipse, a result
of Archimedes’ that was not then extant. The ellipse can be obtained
from a circle of radius a through a transformation under which the
ordinate of the circle at each point is shortened according to a given
ratio, say b:a. Then, following Oresme, one can think of the area of the
ellipse and the area of the circle as made up of all of the ordinates
for points on the curves (Fig. 14.5), but inasmuch as the ratio of the
components of the areas is in the ratio b:a, the areas themselves must
have the same ratio. Yet the area of the circle is known to be πa2;
hence, the area of the ellipse x2 /a2 1y2 /b2 51 must be πab. This
result is correct, but the best that Kepler could do for the
circumference of the ellipse was to give the approximate formula π(a1b).
Lengths of curves in general and of the ellipse in particular were to
elude mathematicians for another half a century.</p>
<p>Kepler had worked with Tycho Brahe first in Denmark and later in
Prague, where, following Brahe’s death, Kepler became mathematician to
the emperor Rudolph II. One of his duties was the casting of</p>
<p>FIG. 14.4</p>
<p>Johanne s Kepler</p>
<p>horoscopes. Mathematicians, whether in the service of emperors or at
universities, found various applications for their talents. The year
1612 had been a very good one for wine, and, while Kepler was in Linz,
in Austria, he began to meditate on the crude methods then in use for
estimating the volumes of wine casks. He compared these with Archimedes’
methods on the volumes of conoids and spheroids, and then he proceeded
to find the volumes of various solids of revolution not previously
considered by Archimedes. For example, he revolved a segment of a circle
about its chord, calling the result a citron if the segment was less
than a semicircle and an apple if the segment exceeded a semicircle. His
volumetric method consisted of regarding the solids as composed of
infinitely many infinitesimal elements, and he proceeded much as we have
indicated earlier for areas. He dispensed with the Archimedean double
reductio ad absurdum, and in this, he was followed by most
mathematicians from that time to the present.</p>
<p>Kepler collected his volumetric thoughts in a book that appeared in
1615 under the title Stereometria Doliorum (Volume-Measurement of
Barrels). For a score of years, it seemed to have excited no great
interest, but in 1635, the Keplerian ideas were systematically expanded
in a celebrated book titled Geometria Indivisibilibus, written by
Bonaventura Cavalieri, a disciple of Galileo’s.</p>
