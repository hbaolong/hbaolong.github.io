<h4 id="trigonometry">Trigonometry</h4>
<p>The trigonometry of Viete, like his algebra, was characterized by
a<code>heightened emphasis on generality and a breadth of view. As Viete was</code>
the effective founder of a literal algebra, so he may with some
justification be called the father of a generalized analytic approach to
trigonometry that is sometimes known as goniometry. Here, too, of
course, Viete started from the work of his predecessors—notably,
Regio-<code>montanus and Rheticus. Like the former, he thought of trigonometry as an independent branch of mathematics; like the latter, he generally worked without direct reference to half chords in a circle. Viete, in the</code>
Canon Mathematicus (1579), prepared extensive tables of all six
functions for angles to the nearest minute. We have seen that he had
urged the use of decimal, rather than sexagesimal, fractions, but to
avoid all fractions as much as possible, Viete chose a “sinus totus” or
hypotenuse` of 100,000 parts for the sine and cosine table and a “basis”
or “perpendiculum” of 100,000 parts for the tangent, cotangent, secant,
and cosecant tables. (Except for the sine function, he did not, however,
use these names.)</p>
<p>In solving oblique triangles, Viete in the` Canon Mathematicus broke
them down into right triangles, but in another work a few years later,
Variorum de Rebus Mathematicis (1593), there is a statement equivalent
to our law of tangents:</p>
<p>ða1bÞ A1B</p>
<p>tan</p>
<p>2 5 2</p>
<p>ða2bÞ A2B</p>
<p>tan</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>Though Viete may have been the first to use this formula, it was`
first published by the German physician and professor of mathematics
Thomas Finck (1561 1656) in 1583, in Geometriae Rotundi Libri XIV.</p>
<p>Trigonometric identities of various sorts were appearing about this
time in all parts of Europe, resulting in reduced emphasis on
computation in the solution of triangles and more on analytic functional
relationships. Among these were a group of formulas known as the
prosthaphaeretic rules—that is, formulas that would convert a product of
functions into a sum or difference (hence the name “prosthaphaeresis,” a
Greek word meaning “addition and subtraction”). From the following type
of diagram, for example, Viete derived the formula`</p>
<p>x1y x2y</p>
<p>sin x1sin y52sin cos :</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>Let sinx5AB (Fig. 13.4) and siny5CD. Then</p>
<p>x2y x1y x2y</p>
<p>sinx1siny5AB1CD5AE 5AC cos 52sin cos :</p>
<p>2 2 2</p>
<p>On making the substitutions (x1y)/25A and (x2y)/25B, we have the more
useful form sin(A1B)1sin(A2B)52 sin A cos B. In a similar manner, one
derives sin (A1B)2sin (A2B)52 cos A sin B by placing the angles x and y
on the same side of the radius OD. The formulas
2cosAcosB5cos(A1B)1cos(A2B)and2sinAsinB5cos(A2B)2 cos(A1B) are somewhat
similarly derived.</p>
<p>y</p>
<p>The previous rules sometimes bear the name “formulas of Werner,” for
they seem to have been used by Werner to simplify astronomical
calculations. At least one of these, that converting a product of
cosines to a sum of cosines, had been known to the Arabs in the time of
ibn-Yunus, but it was only in the sixteenth century, and more
particularly near the end of the century, that the method of
prosthaphaeresis came to be widely used. If, for example, one wished to
multiply 98,436 by 79,253, one could let cos A549,218 (that is,
98,436/2) and cos B579,253. (In modern notation, we would place a
decimal point, temporarily, before each of the numbers and adjust the
decimal point in the answer.) Then, from the table of trigonometric
functions one reads off angles A and B, and from the table one looks up
cos (A1B) and cos (A2B), the sum of these being the product desired.
Note that the product is found without any multiplication having been
performed. In our example of prosthaphaeretic multiplication, there is
not a great saving of time and energy, but when we recall that at that
time, trigonometric tables of a dozen or fifteen significant figures
were not uncommon, the laborsaving possibilities of prosthaphaeresis
become more pronounced. The device was adopted at major astronomical
observatories, including that of Tycho Brahe (1546 1601) in Denmark,
from where word of it was carried to Napier in Scotland. Quotients are
handled in the same manner by using a table of secants and
cosecants.</p>
<p>Perhaps nowhere is Viete’s generalization of trigonometry into
gonio-<code>metrymorepronouncedthaninconnectionwithhismultiple-angleformulas. The double-angle formulas for the sine and the cosine had, of course, been knowntoPtolemy,andthetriple-angleformulasaretheneasilyderivedfrom Ptolemy’s formulas for the sine and the cosine of the sum of two angles. By continuing to use the Ptolemy formulas recursively, a formula for sin nx or cos nx can be derived, but only with great effort. Viete used an ingenious</code>
manipulation of right triangles and the well-known identity</p>
<p>(a2 1b2)(c2 1d2)5(ad1bc)2 1(bd2ac)2</p>
<p>5(ad2bc)2 1(bd1ac)2</p>
<p>to arrive at formulas for multiple angles equivalent to what we
should</p>
<p>now write as</p>
<p>n nðn21Þ n 2 2</p>
<p>cosnx5cos x2 cos xsin x</p>
<p>1U2</p>
<p>1 ð Þð Þð Þcosn4xsin4 x2 n n21 n22 n23</p>
<p>1U2U3U4</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>sinnx5ncosn1xsinx2 ð Þð Þcosn3xsin3x1 ; n n21 n22</p>
<p>1U2U3</p>
<p>where the signs alternate and the coefficients are in magnitude the
alternate numbers in the appropriate line of the arithmetic triangle.
Here we see a striking link between trigonometry and the theory of
numbers.</p>
<p>Trigonometric Solution of Equations</p>
<p>Viete also noted an important link between his formulas and the
solution<code>of the cubic equation. Trigonometry could serve as a handmaid to algebra where the latter had run up against a stone wall—in the irreducible case of the cubic. This evidently occurred to Viete when he noticed that the angle</code>
trisection problem led to a cubic equation. If in the equation x3 13px1
q50 one substitutes mx5y (to obtain a degree of freedom in the later
selection of a value for m), the result is y3 13m2py1m3q50. Comparing
this with the formula cos3 θ2 cos θ2 cos 3θ50, one notes that if y5cos
θ, and if 3m2p52, then2 cos 3θ5m3q. Because p is given, m is now known
(and will be real whenever the three roots are real). Hence, 3θ is
readily determined, because q is known; hence, cos θ is known.
Therefore, y, and from it x, will be known. Moreover, by considering all
possible angles satisfying the conditions, all three real roots will be
found. This trigonometric solution of the irreducible case of the cubic,
suggested by Viete, was later carried out in detail by Girard in 1629
in<code>Invention nouvelle en l’alge</code>bre.</p>
<p>In 1593, Viete found an unusual opportunity to use his
multiple-angle` formulas. The Belgian mathematician and professor of
medicine Adriaen van Roomen (1561 1615) had issued a public challenge to
anyone to solve an equation of the forty-fifth degree:</p>
<p>x45 45x43 1945x41 3795x3 145x5K.</p>
<p>The ambassador from the Low Countries to the court of Henry IV
boasted that France had no mathematician capable of solving the problem
proposed by his countryman. Viete, called on to defend the
honor<code>of France, noted that the proposed equation was one that arises in expressing K5sin45θ in terms of x52sinθ, and he promptly found the positive roots. The achievement so impressed van Roomen that he paid Viete a special visit; this resulted in their frequently communicating and</code>
challenging each other with problems. When Viete sent van Roomen the`
Apollonian problem of constructing a circle tangent to three given
circles, the latter solved it with the use of hyperbolas.</p>
<p>In applying trigonometrytoarithmetic andalgebraicproblems, Vietewas`
broadening the scope of the subject. Moreover, his multiple-angle
formulas should have disclosed the periodicity of the goniometric
functions, but it was probably his hesitancy with respect to negative
numbers that prevented him—or his contemporaries—from going as far as
this. There was considerable enthusiasm for trigonometry in the late
sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, but this primarily took the
form of synthesis and textbooks. It was during this period that the name
“trigonometry” came to be attached to the subject. It was used as the
title of an exposition by Bartholomaeus Pitiscus (1561 1613), the
successor to Valentin Otho at Heidelberg; this was first published in
1595 as a supplement to a book on spherics and again independently in
1600, 1606, and 1612. Coincidentally, the development of logarithms,
ever since a close ally of trigonometry, was also taking place during
these years.</p>
