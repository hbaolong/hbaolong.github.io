<h4 id="preface-to-the-third-edition">Preface to the Third Edition</h4>
<p>During the two decades since the appearance of the second edition of
this work, there have been substantial changes in the course of
mathematics and the treatment of its history. Within mathematics,
outstanding results were achieved by a merging of techniques and
concepts from previously distinct areas of specialization. The history
of mathematics continued to grow quantitatively, as noted in the preface
to the second edition; but here, too, there were substantial studies
that overcame the polemics of “internal” versus “external” history and
combined a fresh approach to the mathematics of the original texts with
the appropriate linguistic, sociological, and economic tools of the
historian.</p>
<p>In this third edition I have striven again to adhere to Boyer’s
approach to the history of mathematics. Although the revision this time
includes the entire work, changes have more to do with emphasis than
original content, the obvious exception being the inclusion of new
findings since the appearance of the first edition. For example, the
reader will find greater stress placed on the fact that we deal with
such a small number of sources from antiquity; this is one of the
reasons for condensing three previous chapters dealing with the Hellenic
period into one. On the other hand, the chapter dealing with China and
India has been split, as content demands. There is greater emphasis on
the recurring interplay between pure and applied mathematics as
exemplified in chapter 14. Some reorganization is due to an attempt to
underline the impact of institutional and personal transmission of
ideas; this has affected most of the pre-nineteenth-century chapters.
The chapters dealing with the nineteenth century have been altered the
least, as I had made substantial changes for some of this material in
the second edition. The twentieth-century material has been doubled, and
a new final chapter deals with recent trends, including solutions of
some longstanding problems and the effect of computers on the nature of
proofs.</p>
<p>It is always pleasant to acknowledge those known to us for having had
an impact on our work. I am most grateful to Shirley Surrette Duffy for
responding judiciously to numerous requests for stylistic advice, even
at times when there were more immediate priorities. Peggy Aldrich
Kidwell replied with unfailing precision to my inquiry concerning
certain photographs in the National Museum of American History. Jeanne
LaDuke cheerfully and promptly answered my appeals for help, especially
in confirming sources. Judy and Paul Green may not realize that a casual
conversation last year led me to rethink some recent material. I have
derived special pleasure and knowledge from several recent publications,
among them Klopfer 2009 and, in a more leisurely fashion, Szpiro 2007.
Great thanks are due to the editors and production team of John Wiley
andandandand Sons who worked with me to make this edition possible:
Stephen Power, the senior editor, was unfailingly generous and
diplomatic in his counsel; the editorial assistant, Ellen Wright,
facilitated my progress through the major steps of manuscript creation;
the senior production manager, Marcia Samuels, provided me with clear
and concise instructions, warnings, and examples; senior production
editors Kimberly Monroe-Hill and John Simko and the copyeditor, Patricia
Waldygo, subjected the manuscript to painstakingly meticulous scrutiny.
The professionalism of all concerned provides a special kind of
encouragement in troubled times.</p>
<p>I should like to pay tribute to two scholars whose influence on
others should not be forgotten. The Renaissance historian Marjorie N.
Boyer (Mrs. Carl B. Boyer) graciously and knowledgeably complimented a
young researcher at the beginning of her career on a talk presented at a
Leibniz conference in 1966. The brief conversation with a total stranger
did much to influence me in pondering the choice between mathematics and
its history.</p>
<p>More recently, the late historian of mathematics Wilbur Knorr set a
significant example to a generation of young scholars by refusing to
accept the notion that ancient authors had been studied definitively by
others. Setting aside the “magister dixit,” he showed us the wealth of
knowledge that emerges from seeking out the texts.</p>
