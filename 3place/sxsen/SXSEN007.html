<p>How much is one god beyond the other god?</p>
<p>—An Old Babylonian astronomical text</p>
<p>The Era and the Sources</p>
<p>The fourth millennium before our era was a period of remarkable
cultural development, bringing with it the use of writing, the wheel,
and metals. As in Egypt during the first dynasty, which began toward the
end of this extraordinary millennium, so also in the Mesopotamian Valley
there was at the time a high order of civilization. There the Sumerians
had built homes and temples decorated with artistic pottery and mosaics
in geometric patterns. Powerful rulers united the local principalities
into an empire that completed vast public works, such as a system of
canals to irrigate the land and control flooding between the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers, where the overflow of the rivers was not predictable,
as was the inundation of the Nile Valley. The cuneiform pattern of
writing that the Sumerians had developed during the fourth millennium
probably antedates the Egyptian hieroglyphic system.</p>
<p>The Mesopotamian civilizations of antiquity are often referred to as
Babylonian, although such a designation is not strictly correct. The
city of Babylon was not at first, nor was it always at later periods,
the center of the culture associated with the two rivers, but convention
has sanctioned the informal use of the name “Babylonian” for the region
during the interval from about 2000 to roughly 600 BCE. When in 538 BCE
Babylon fell to Cyrus of Persia, the city was spared, but the Babylonian
Empire had come to an end. “Babylonian” mathematics, however, continued
through the Seleucid period in Syria almost to the dawn of
Christianity.</p>
<p>Then, as today, the Land of the Two Rivers was open to invasions from
many directions, making the Fertile Crescent a battlefield with
frequently changing hegemony. One of the most significant of the
invasions was that by the Semitic Akkadians under Sargon I (ca.
2276–2221 BCE), or Sargon the Great. He established an empire that
extended from the Persian Gulf in the south to the Black Sea in the
north, and from the steppes of Persia in the east to the Mediterranean
Sea in the west. Under Sargon, the invaders began a gradual absorption
of the indigenous Sumerian culture, including the cuneiform script.
Later invasions and revolts brought various racial strains—Ammorites,
Kassites, Elamites, Hittites, Assyrians, Medes, Persians, and others—to
political power at one time or another in the valley, but there remained
in the area a sufficiently high degree of cultural unity to justify
referring to the civilization simply as Mesopotamian. In particular, the
use of cuneiform script formed a strong bond.</p>
<p>Laws, tax accounts, stories, school lessons, personal letters—these
and many other records were impressed on soft clay tablets with
styluses, and the tablets were then baked in the hot sun or in ovens.
Such written documents were far less vulnerable to the ravages of time
than were Egyptian papyri; hence, a much larger body of evidence about
Mesopotamian mathematics is available today than exists about the
Nilotic system. From one locality alone, the site of ancient Nippur, we
have some 50,000 tablets. The university libraries at Columbia,
Pennsylvania, and Yale, among others, have large collections of ancient
tablets from Mesopotamia, some of them mathematical. Despite the
availability of documents, however, it was the Egyptian hieroglyphic,
rather than the Babylonian cuneiform, that was first deciphered in
modern times. The German philologist F. W. Grotefend had made some
progress in the reading of Babylonian script early in the nineteenth
century, but only during the second quarter of the twentieth century did
substantial accounts of Mesopotamian mathematics begin to appear in
histories of antiquity.</p>
<p>Cuneiform Writing</p>
<p>The early use of writing in Mesopotamia is attested to by hundreds of
clay tablets found in Uruk and dating from about 5,000 years ago. By
this time, picture writing had reached the point where conventionalized
stylized forms were used for many things: for water, for eye, and
combinations of these to indicate weeping. Gradually, the number of
signs became smaller, so that of some 2,000 Sumerian signs originally
used, only a third remained by the time of the Akkadian conquest.
Primitive drawings gave way to combinations of wedges: water became and
eye . At first, the scribe wrote from top to bottom in columns from
right to left; later, for convenience, the table was rotated
counterclockwise through 90°, and the scribe wrote from left to right in
horizontal rows from top to bottom. The stylus, which formerly had been
a triangular prism, was replaced by a right circular cylinder—or,
rather, two cylinders of unequal radius. During the earlier days of the
Sumerian civilization, the end of the stylus was pressed into the clay
vertically to represent 10 units and obliquely to represent a unit,
using the smaller stylus; similarly, an oblique impression with the
larger stylus indicated 60 units and a vertical impression indicated
3,600 units. Combinations of these were used to represent intermediate
numbers.</p>
<p>Numbers and Fractions: Sexagesimals</p>
<p>As the Akkadians adopted the Sumerian form of writing, lexicons were
compiled giving equivalents in the two tongues, and forms of words and
numerals became less varied. Thousands of tablets from about the time of
the Hammurabi dynasty (ca. 1800–1600 BCE) illustrate a number system
that had become well established. The decimal system, common to most
civilizations, both ancient and modern, had been submerged in
Mesopotamia under a notation that made fundamental the base 60. Much has
been written about the motives behind this change; it has been suggested
that astronomical considerations may have been instrumental or that the
sexagesimal scheme might have been the natural combination of two
earlier schemes, one decimal and the other using the base 6. It appears
more likely, however, that the base 60 was consciously adopted and
legalized in the interests of metrology, for a magnitude of 60 units can
be subdivided easily into halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, sixths,
tenths, twelfths, fifteenths, twentieths, and thirtieths, thus affording
ten possible subdivisions. Whatever the origin, the sexagesimal system
of numeration has enjoyed a remarkably long life, for remnants survive,
unfortunately for consistency, even to this day in units of time and
angle measure, despite the fundamentally decimal form of mathematics in
our society.</p>
<p>Positional Numeration</p>
<p>Babylonian cuneiform numeration, for smaller whole numbers, proceeded
along the same lines as did the Egyptian hieroglyphic, with repetitions
of the symbols for units and tens. Where the Egyptian architect, carving
on stone, might write 59 as , the Mesopotamian scribe could similarly
represent the same number on a clay tablet through fourteen wedge-shaped
marks—five broad sideways wedges or “angle-brackets,” each representing
10 units, and nine thin vertical wedges, each standing for a unit, all
juxtaposed in a neat group as . Beyond the number 59, however, the
Egyptian and Babylonian systems differed markedly. Perhaps it was the
inflexibility of the Mesopotamian writing materials, possibly it was a
flash of imaginative insight that made the Babylonians realize that
their two symbols for units and tens sufficed for the representation of
any integer, however large, without excessive repetitiveness. This was
made possible through their invention, some 4,000 years ago, of the
positional notation—the same principle that accounts for the
effectiveness of our present numeral forms. That is, the ancient
Babylonians saw that their symbols could be assigned values that depend
on their relative positions in the representation of a number. Our
number 222 makes use of the same cipher three times, but with a
different meaning each time. Once it represents two units, the second
time it means two 10s, and finally it stands for two 100s (that is,
twice the square of the base 10). In a precisely analogous way, the
Babylonians made multiple use of such a symbol as . When they wrote ,
clearly separating the three groups of two wedges each, they understood
the right-hand group to mean two units, the next group to mean twice
their base, 60, and the left-hand group to signify twice the square of
their base. This numeral, therefore, denoted 2(60)2 + 2(60) + 2 (or
7,322 in our notation).</p>
<p>A wealth of primary material exists concerning Mesopotamian
mathematics, but, oddly enough, most of it comes from two periods widely
separated in time. There is an abundance of tablets from the first few
hundred years of the second millennium BCE (the Old Babylonian age), and
many tablets have also been found dating from the last few centuries of
the first millennium BCE (the Seleucid period). Most of the important
contributions to mathematics will be found to go back to the earlier
period, but one contribution is not in evidence until almost 300 BCE.
The Babylonians seem at first to have had no clear way in which to
indicate an “empty” position—that is, they did not have a zero symbol,
although they sometimes left a space where a zero was intended. This
meant that their forms for the numbers 122 and 7,202 looked very much
alike, for might mean either 2(60) + 2 or 2(60)2 + 2. Context in many
cases could be relied on to relieve some of the ambiguity, but the lack
of a zero symbol, such as enables us to distinguish at a glance between
22 and 202, must have been quite inconvenient.</p>
<p>By about the time of the conquest by Alexander the Great, however, a
special sign, consisting of two small wedges placed obliquely, was
invented to serve as a placeholder where a numeral was missing. From
that time on, as long as cuneiform was used, the number , or 2(60)2 +
0(60) + 2, was readily distinguishable from , or 2(60) + 2.</p>
<p>The Babylonian zero symbol apparently did not end all ambiguity, for
the sign seems to have been used for intermediate empty positions only.
There are no extant tablets in which the zero sign appears in a terminal
position. This means that the Babylonians in antiquity never achieved an
absolute positional system. Position was only relative; hence, the
symbol could represent 2(60) + 2 or 2(60)2 + 2(60) or 2(60)3 + 2(60)2 or
any one of indefinitely many other numbers in which two successive
positions are involved.</p>
<p>Sexagesimal Fractions</p>
<p>Had Mesopotamian mathematics, like that of the Nile Valley, been
based on the addition of integers and unit fractions, the invention of
the positional notation would not have been greatly significant at the
time. It is not much more difficult to write 98,765 in hieroglyphic
notation than in cuneiform, and the latter is definitely more difficult
to write than the same number in hieratic script. The secret of the
superiority of Babylonian mathematics over that of the Egyptians lies in
the fact that those who lived “between the two rivers” took the most
felicitous step of extending the principle of position to cover
fractions as well as whole numbers. That is, the notation was used not
only for 2(60) + 2, but also for 2 + 2(60)−1 or for 2(60)−1 + 2(60)−2 or
for other fractional forms involving two successive positions. This
meant that the Babylonians had at their command the computational power
that the modern decimal fractional notation affords us today. For the
Babylonian scholar, as for the modern engineer, the addition or the
multiplication of 23.45 and 9.876 was essentially no more difficult than
was the addition or the multiplication of the whole numbers 2,345 and
9,876, and the Mesopotamians were quick to exploit this important
discovery.</p>
<p>Approximations</p>
<p>An Old Babylonian tablet from the Yale Collection (No. 7289) includes
the calculation of the square root of 2 to three sexagesimal places, the
answer being written . In modern characters, this number can be
appropriately written as 1;24,51,10, where a semicolon is used to
separate the integral and fractional parts, and a comma is used as a
separatrix for the sexagesimal positions. This form will generally be
used throughout this chapter to designate numbers in sexagesimal
notation. Translating this notation into decimal form, we have 1 +
24(60)−1 + 51(60)−2 + 10(60)−3. This Babylonian value for is equal to
approximately 1.414222, differing by about 0.000008 from the true value.
Accuracy in approximations was relatively easy for the Babylonians to
achieve with their fractional notation, which was rarely equaled until
the time of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of Babylonian computation did not result from their
system of numeration alone. Mesopotamian mathematicians were skillful in
developing algorithmic procedures, among which was a square-root process
often ascribed to later men. It is sometimes attributed to the Greek
scholar Archytas (428–365 BCE) or to Heron of Alexandria (ca. 100 CE);
occasionally, one finds it called Newton’s algorithm. This Babylonian
procedure is as simple as it is effective. Let be the root desired, and
let a1 be a first approximation to this root; let a second approximation
be found from the equation b1 = a/a1. If a1 is too small, then b1 is too
large, and vice versa. Hence, the arithmetic mean is a plausible next
approximation. Inasmuch as a2 is always too large, the next
approximation, b2 = a/a2, will be too small, and one takes the
arithmetic mean to obtain a still better result; the procedure can be
continued indefinitely. The value of on Yale Tablet 7289 will be found
to be that of a3, where a1 = 1;30. In the Babylonian square-root
algorithm, one finds an iterative procedure that could have put the
mathematicians of the time in touch with infinite processes, but
scholars of that era did not pursue the implications of such
problems.</p>
<p>The algorithm just described is equivalent to a two-term
approximation to the binomial series, a case with which the Babylonians
were familiar. If is desired, the approximation a1 = a leads to b1 = (a2
+ b)/a and a2 = (a1 + b1)/2 = a + b/(2a), which is in agreement with the
first two terms in the expansion of (a2 + b)1/2 and provides an
approximation found in Old Babylonian texts.</p>
<p>Tables</p>
<p>A substantial proportion of the cuneiform tablets that have been
unearthed are “table texts,” including multiplication tables, tables of
reciprocals, and tables of squares and cubes and of square and cube
roots written, of course, in cuneiform sexagesimals. One of these, for
example, carries the equivalents of the entries shown in the following
table:</p>
<p>2 30</p>
<p>3 20</p>
<p>4 15</p>
<p>5 12</p>
<p>6 10</p>
<p>8 7, 30</p>
<p>9 6, 40</p>
<p>10 6</p>
<p>12 5</p>
<p>The product of elements in the same line is in all cases 60, the
Babylonian number base, and the table apparently was thought of as a
table of reciprocals. The sixth line, for example, denotes that the
reciprocal of 8 is 7/60 + 30/(60)2. It will be noted that the
reciprocals of 7 and 11 are missing from the table, because the
reciprocals of such “irregular” numbers are nonterminating sexagesimals,
just as in our decimal system the reciprocals of 3, 6, 7, and 9 are
infinite when expanded decimally. Again, the Babylonians were faced with
the problem of infinity, but they did not consider it systematically. At
one point, however, a Mesopotamian scribe seems to give upper and lower
bounds for the reciprocal of the irregular number 7, placing it between
0;8,34,16,59 and 0;8,34,18.</p>
<p>It is clear that the fundamental arithmetic operations were handled
by the Babylonians in a manner not unlike that which would be employed
today, and with comparable facility. Division was not carried out by the
clumsy duplication method of the Egyptians, but through an easy
multiplication of the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor, using
the appropriate items in the table texts. Just as today the quotient of
34 divided by 5 is easily found by multiplying 34 by 2 and shifting the
decimal point, so in antiquity the same division problem was carried out
by finding the product of 34 by 12 and shifting one sexagesimal place to
obtain . Tables of reciprocals in general furnished reciprocals only of
“regular” integers—that is, those that can be written as products of
twos, threes, and fives—although there are a few exceptions. One table
text includes the approximations and . Here we have sexagesimal
analogues of our decimal expressions and , unit fractions in which the
denominator is one more or one less than the base, but it appears again
that the Babylonians did not notice, or at least did not regard as
significant, the infinite periodic expansions in this connection.</p>
<p>One finds among the Old Babylonian tablets some table texts
containing successive powers of a given number, analogous to our modern
tables of logarithms or, more properly speaking, of antilogarithms.
Exponential (or logarithmic) tables have been found in which the first
ten powers are listed for the bases 9 and 16 and 1,40 and 3,45 (all
perfect squares). The question raised in a problem text asking to what
power a certain number must be raised in order to yield a given number
is equivalent to our question “What is the logarithm of the given number
in a system with a certain number as base?” The chief differences
between the ancient tables and our own, apart from matters of language
and notation, are that no single number was systematically used as a
base in various connections and that the gaps between entries in the
ancient tables are far larger than in our tables. Then, too, their
“logarithm tables” were not used for general purposes of calculation,
but rather to solve certain very specific questions.</p>
<p>Despite the large gaps in their exponential tables, Babylonian
mathematicians did not hesitate to interpolate by proportional parts to
approximate intermediate values. Linear interpolation seems to have been
a commonplace procedure in ancient Mesopotamia, and the positional
notation lent itself conveniently to the rule of three. A clear instance
of the practical use of interpolation within exponential tables is seen
in a problem text that asks how long it will take money to double at 20
percent annually; the answer given is 3;47,13,20. It seems to be quite
clear that the scribe used linear interpolation between the values for
(1;12)3 and (1;12)4, following the compound interest formula a = P(1 +
r)n, where r is 20 percent, or , and reading values from an exponential
table with powers of 1;12.</p>
<p>Equations</p>
<p>One table for which the Babylonians found considerable use is a
tabulation of the values of n3 + n2 for integral values of n, a table
essential in Babylonian algebra; this subject reached a considerably
higher level in Mesopotamia than in Egypt. Many problem texts from the
Old Babylonian period show that the solution of the complete three-term
quadratic equation afforded the Babylonians no serious difficulty, for
flexible algebraic operations had been developed. They could transpose
terms in an equation by adding equals to equals, and they could multiply
both sides by like quantities to remove fractions or to eliminate
factors. By adding 4ab to (a − b)2 they could obtain (a + b)2, for they
were familiar with many simple forms of factoring. They did not use
letters for unknown quantities, for the alphabet had not yet been
invented, but words such as “length,” “breadth,” “area,” and “volume”
served effectively in this capacity. That these words may well have been
used in a very abstract sense is suggested by the fact that the
Babylonians had no qualms about adding a “length” to an “area” or an
“area” to a “volume.”</p>
<p>Egyptian algebra had been much concerned with linear equations, but
the Babylonians evidently found these too elementary for much attention.
In one problem, the weight x of a stone is called for if is one mina;
the answer is simply given as 48;7,30 gin, where 60 gin make a mina. In
another problem in an Old Babylonian text, we find two simultaneous
linear equations in two unknown quantities, called respectively the
“first silver ring” and the “second silver ring.” If we call these x and
y in our notation, the equations are x/7 + y/11 = 1 and 6x/7 = l0y/11.
The answer is expressed laconically in terms of the rule</p>
<p>In another pair of equations, part of the method of solution is
included in the text. Here width + length = 7 hands, and length + width
= 10 hands. The solution is first found by replacing each “hand” with 5
“fingers” and then noticing that a width of 20 fingers and a length of
30 fingers will satisfy both equations. Following this, however, the
solution is found by an alternative method equivalent to an elimination
through combination. Expressing all dimensions in terms of hands, and
letting the length and the width be x and y, respectively, the equations
become y + 4x = 28 and x + y = 10. Subtracting the second equation from
the first, one has the result 3x = 18; hence, x = 6 hands, or 30
fingers, and y = 20 fingers.</p>
<p>Quadratic Equations</p>
<p>The solution of a three-term quadratic equation seems to have
exceeded by far the algebraic capabilities of the Egyptians, but Otto
Neugebauer in 1930 disclosed that such equations had been handled
effectively by the Babylonians in some of the oldest problem texts. For
instance, one problem calls for the side of a square if the area less
the side is 14,30. The solution of this problem, equivalent to solving
x2−x = 870, is expressed as follows:</p>
<p>Take half of 1, which is 0;30, and multiply 0;30 by 0;30, which is
0;15; add this to 14,30 to get l4,30;15. This is the square of 29;30.
Now add 0;30 to 29;30, and the result is 30, the side of the square.</p>
<p>The Babylonian solution is, of course, exactly equivalent to the
formula for a root of the equation x2 − px = q, which is the quadratic
formula that is familiar to high school students of today. In another
text, the equation 1x2 + 7x = 6;15 was reduced by the Babylonians to the
standard type x2 + px = q by first multiplying through by 11 to obtain
(11x)2 + 7(11x) = 1,8;45. This is a quadratic in normal form in the
unknown quantity y = 11x, and the solution for y is easily obtained by
the familiar rule , from which the value of x is then determined. This
solution is remarkable as an instance of the use of algebraic
transformations.</p>
<p>Until modern times, there was no thought of solving a quadratic
equation of the form x2 + px + q = 0, where p and q are positive, for
the equation has no positive root. Consequently, quadratic equations in
ancient and medieval times—and even in the early modern period—were
classified under three types:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>x2 + px = q</p></li>
<li><p>x2 = px + q</p></li>
<li><p>x2 + q = px</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All three types are found in Old Babylonian texts of some 4,000 years
ago. The first two types are illustrated by the problems given
previously; the third type appears frequently in problem texts, where it
is treated as equivalent to the simultaneous system x + y = p, xy = q.
So numerous are problems in which one is asked to find two numbers when
given their product and either their sum or their difference that these
seem to have constituted for the ancients, both Babylonian and Greek, a
sort of “normal form” to which quadratics were reduced. Then, by
transforming the simultaneous equations xy = a and x ± y = b into the
pair of linear equations the values of x and y are found through an
addition and a subtraction. A Yale cuneiform tablet, for example, asks
for the solution of the system x + y = 6;30 and xy = 7;30. The
instructions of the scribe are essentially as follows. First find</p>
<p>and then find</p>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Hence,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>From the last two equations, it is obvious that x = 5 and . Because
the quantities x and y enter symmetrically in the given conditional
equations, it is possible to interpret the values of x and y as the two
roots of the quadratic equation x2 + 7;30 = 6;30x. Another Babylonian
text calls for a number that when added to its reciprocal becomes
2;0,0,33,20. This leads to a quadratic of type 3, and again we have two
solutions, 1;0,45 and 0;59,15,33,20.</p>
<p>Cubic Equations</p>
<p>The Babylonian reduction of a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx
= c to the normal form y2 + by = ac through the substitution y = ax
shows the extraordinary degree of flexibility in Mesopotamian algebra.
There is no record in Egypt of the solution of a cubic equation, but
among the Babylonians there are many instances of this.</p>
<p>Pure cubics, such as x3 = 0;7,30, were solved by direct reference to
tables of cubes and cube roots, where the solution x = 0;30 was read
off. Linear interpolation within the tables was used to find
approximations for values not listed in the tables. Mixed cubics in the
standard form x3 + x2 = a were solved similarly by reference to the
available tables, which listed values of the combination n3 + n2 for
integral values of n from 1 to 30. With the help of these tables, they
easily read off that the solution, for example, of x3 + x2 = 4,12 is
equal to 6. For still more general cases of equations of the third
degree, such as 144x3 + 12x2 = 21, the Babylonians used their method of
substitution. Multiplying both sides by 12 and using y = 12x, the
equation becomes y3 + y2 = 4,12, from which y is found to be equal to 6,
hence x is just or 0;30. Cubics of the form ax3 + bx2 = c are reducible
to the Babylonian normal form by multiplying through by a2/b3 to obtain
(ax/b)3 + (ax/b)2 = ca2/b3, a cubic of standard type in the unknown
quantity ax/b. Reading off from the tables the value of this unknown
quantity, the value of x is determined. Whether the Babylonians were
able to reduce the general four-term cubic, ax3 + bx2 + ex = d, to their
normal form is not known. It is not too unlikely that they could reduce
it, as is indicated by the fact that a solution of a quadratic suffices
to carry the four-term equation to the three-term form px3 + qx2 = r,
from which, as we have seen, the normal form is readily obtained. There
is, however, no evidence now available to suggest that the Mesopotamian
mathematicians actually carried out such a reduction of the general
cubic equation.</p>
<p>With modern symbolism, it is a simple matter to see that (ax)3 +
(ax)2 = b is essentially the same type of equation as y3 + y2 = b, but
to recognize this without our notation is an achievement of far greater
significance for the development of mathematics than even the vaunted
positional principle in arithmetic that we owe to the same civilization.
Babylonian algebra had reached such an extraordinary level of
abstraction that the equations ax4 + bx2 = c and ax8 + bx4 = c were
recognized as nothing worse than quadratic equations in disguise—that
is, quadratics in x2 and x4.</p>
<p>Measurements: Pythagorean Triads</p>
<p>The algebraic achievements of the Babylonians are admirable, but the
motives behind this work are not easy to understand. It has commonly
been supposed that virtually all pre-Hellenic science and mathematics
were purely utilitarian, but what sort of real-life situation in ancient
Babylon could possibly lead to problems involving the sum of a number
and its reciprocal or a difference between an area and a length? If
utility was the motive, then the cult of immediacy was less strong than
it is now, for direct connections between purpose and practice in
Babylonian mathematics are far from apparent. That there may well have
been toleration for, if not encouragement of, mathematics for its own
sake is suggested by a tablet (No. 322) in the Plimpton Collection at
Columbia University. The tablet dates from the Old Babylonian period
(ca. 1900–1600 BCE), and the tabulations it contains could easily be
interpreted as a record of business accounts. Analysis, however, shows
that it has deep mathematical significance in the theory of numbers and
that it was perhaps related to a kind of proto-trigonometry. Plimpton
322 was part of a larger tablet, as is illustrated by the break along
the left-hand edge, and the remaining portion contains four columns of
numbers arranged in fifteen horizontal rows. The right-hand column
contains the digits from 1 to 15, and, evidently, its purpose was simply
to identify in order the items in the other three columns, arranged as
follows:</p>
<p>The tablet is not in such excellent condition that all of the numbers
can still be read, but the clearly discernible pattern of construction
in the table made it possible to determine from the context the few
items that were missing because of small fractures. To understand what
the entries in the table probably meant to the Babylonians, consider the
right triangle ABC (Fig. 3.1). If the numbers in the second and third
columns (from left to right) are thought of as the sides a and c,
respectively, of the right triangle, then the first, or left-hand,
column contains in each case the square of the ratio of c to b. The
left-hand column, therefore, is a short table of values of sec2 A, but
we must not assume that the Babylonians were familiar with our secant
concept. Neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians introduced a measure
of angles in the modern sense. Nevertheless, the rows of numbers in
Plimpton 322 are not arranged in haphazard fashion, as a superficial
glance might imply. If the first comma in column one (on the left) is
replaced by a semicolon, it is obvious that the numbers in this column
decrease steadily from top to bottom. Moreover, the first number is
quite close to sec2 45°, and the last number in the column is
approximately sec231°, with the intervening numbers close to the values
of sec2A as A decreases by degrees from 45° to 31°. This arrangement
obviously is not the result of chance alone. Not only was the
arrangement carefully thought out, but the dimensions of the triangle
were also derived according to a rule. Those who constructed the table
evidently began with two regular sexagesimal integers, which we shall
call p and q, with p &gt; q, and then formed the triple of numbers p2 −
q2 and 2pq and p2 + q2. The three integers thus obtained are easily seen
to form a Pythagorean triple, in which the square of the largest is
equal to the sum of the squares of the other two. Hence, these numbers
can be used as the dimensions of the right triangle ABC, with a = p2 −
q2 and b = 2pq and c = p2 + q2. Restricting themselves to values of p
less than 60 and to corresponding values of q such that , that is, to
right triangles for which a &lt; b, the Babylonians presumably found
that there were just 38 possible pairs of values of p and q satisfying
the conditions, and for these they apparently formed the 38
corresponding Pythagorean triples. Only the first 15, arranged in
descending order for the ratio (p2 + q2)/2pq, are included in the table
on the tablet, but it is likely that the scribe had intended to continue
the table on the other side of the tablet. It has also been suggested
that the portion of Plimpton 322 that has broken off from the left side
contained four additional columns, in which were tabulated the values of
p and q and 2pq and what we should now call tan2A.</p>
<p>FIG. 3.1</p>
<p>The Plimpton Tablet 322 might give the impression that it is an
exercise in the theory of numbers, but it is likely that this aspect of
the subject was merely ancillary to the problem of measuring the areas
of squares on the sides of a right triangle. The Babylonians disliked
working with the reciprocals of irregular numbers, for these could not
be expressed exactly in finite sexagesimal fractions. Hence, they were
interested in values of p and q that should give them regular integers
for the sides of right triangles of varying shapes, from the isosceles
right triangle down to one with a small value for the ratio a/b. For
example, the numbers in the first row are found by starting with p = 12
and q = 5, with the corresponding values a = 119 and b = 120 and c =
169. The values of a and c are precisely those in the second and third
positions from the left in the first row on the Plimpton tablet; the
ratio c2/b2 = 28561/14400 is the number 1;59,0,15 that appears in the
first position in this row. The same relationship is found in the other
fourteen rows; the Babylonians carried out the work so accurately that
the ratio c2/b2 in the tenth row is expressed as a fraction with eight
sexagesimal places, equivalent to about fourteen decimal places in our
notation.</p>
<p>Plimpton 322</p>
<p>So much of Babylonian mathematics is bound up with tables of
reciprocals that it is not surprising to find that the items in Plimpton
322 are related to reciprocal relationships. If a = 1, then 1 = (c +
b)(c − b), so that c + b and c − b are reciprocals. If one starts with c
+ b = n, where n is any regular sexagesimal, then c − b = l/n; hence, a
= 1 and and are a Pythagorean fraction triple, which can easily be
converted to a Pythagorean integer triple by multiplying each of the
three by 2n. All triples in the Plimpton tablet are easily calculated by
this device.</p>
<p>The account of Babylonian algebra that we have given is
representative of their work, but it is not intended to be exhaustive.
There are in the Babylonian tablets many other things, although none so
striking as those in the Plimpton Tablet 322; as in this case, many are
still open to multiple interpretations. For instance, in one tablet the
geometric progression 1 + 2 + 22 + . . . + 29 is summed, and in another
the sum of the series of squares 12 + 22 + 32 + . . . + 102 is found.
One wonders whether the Babylonians knew the general formulas for the
sum of a geometric progression and the sum of the first n perfect
squares. It is quite possible that they did, and it has been conjectured
that they were aware that the sum of the first n perfect cubes is equal
to the square of the sum of the first n integers. Nevertheless, it must
be borne in mind that tablets from Mesopotamia resemble Egyptian papyri
in that only specific cases are given, with no general formulations.</p>
<p>Polygonal Areas</p>
<p>It used to be held that the Babylonians were better in algebra than
were the Egyptians, but that they had contributed less to geometry. The
first half of this statement is clearly substantiated by what we have
learned in previous paragraphs; attempts to bolster the second half of
the comparison generally are limited to the measure of the circle or to
the volume of the frustum of a pyramid. In the Mesopotamian Valley, the
area of a circle was generally found by taking three times the square of
the radius, and in accuracy this falls considerably below the Egyptian
measure. Yet the counting of decimal places in the approximations for π
is scarcely an appropriate measure of the geometric stature of a
civilization, and a twentieth-century discovery has effectively
nullified even this weak argument.</p>
<p>In 1936, a group of mathematical tablets was unearthed at Susa, a
couple of hundred miles from Babylon, and these include significant
geometric results. True to the Mesopotamian penchant for making tables
and lists, one tablet in the Susa group compares the areas and the
squares of the sides of the regular polygons of three, four, five, six,
and seven sides. The ratio of the area of the pentagon, for example, to
the square on the side of the pentagon is given as 1;40, a value that is
correct to two significant figures. For the hexagon and the heptagon,
the ratios are expressed as 2;37,30 and 3;41, respectively. In the same
tablet, the scribe gives 0;57,36 as the ratio of the perimeter of the
regular hexagon to the circumference of the circumscribed circle, and
from this, we can readily conclude that the Babylonian scribe had
adopted 3;7,30, or , as an approximation for π. This is at least as good
as the value adopted in Egypt. Moreover, we see it in a more
sophisticated context than in Egypt, for the tablet from Susa is a good
example of the systematic comparison of geometric figures. One is almost
tempted to see in it the genuine origin of geometry, but it is important
to note that it was not so much the geometric context that interested
the Babylonians as the numerical approximations that they used in
mensuration. Geometry for them was not a mathematical discipline in our
sense, but a sort of applied algebra or arithmetic in which numbers are
attached to figures.</p>
<p>There is some disagreement as to whether the Babylonians were
familiar with the concept of similar figures, although this appears to
be likely. The similarity of all circles seems to have been taken for
granted in Mesopotamia, as it had been in Egypt, and the many problems
on triangle measure in cuneiform tablets seem to imply a concept of
similarity. A tablet in the Baghdad Museum has a right triangle ABC
(Fig. 3.2) with sides a = 60 and b = 45 and c = 75, and it is subdivided
into four smaller right triangles, ACD, CDE, DEF, and EFB. The areas of
these four triangles are then given as 8,6 and 5,11;2,24 and
3,19;3,56,9,36 and 5,53;53,39,50,24, respectively. From these values,
the scribe computed the length of AD as 27, apparently using a sort of
“similarity formula” equivalent to our theorem that areas of similar
figures are to each other as squares on corresponding sides. The lengths
of CD and BD are found to be 36 and 48, respectively, and through an
application of the “similarity formula” to triangles BCD and DCE, the
length of CE is found to be 21;36. The text breaks off in the middle of
the calculation of DE.</p>
<p>FIG. 3.2</p>
<p>Geometry as Applied Arithmetic</p>
<p>Measurement was the keynote of algebraic geometry in the Mesopotamian
Valley, but a major flaw, as in Egyptian geometry, was that the
distinction between exact and approximate measures was not made clear.
The area of a quadrilateral was found by taking the product of the
arithmetic means of the pairs of opposite sides, with no warning that
this is in most cases only a crude approximation. Again, the volume of a
frustum of a cone or a pyramid was sometimes found by taking the
arithmetic mean of the upper and lower bases and multiplying by the
height; sometimes, for a frustum of a square pyramid with areas a2 and
b2 for the lower and upper bases, the formula</p>
<p>was applied. For the latter, however, the Babylonians also used a
rule equivalent to</p>
<p>a formula that is correct and reduces to the one used by the
Egyptians.</p>
<p>It is not known whether Egyptian and Babylonian results were always
independently discovered, but in any case, the latter were definitely
more extensive than the former, in both geometry and algebra. The
Pythagorean theorem, for example, does not appear in any form in
surviving documents from Egypt, but tablets even from the Old Babylonian
period show that in Mesopotamia the theorem was widely used. A cuneiform
text from the Yale Collection, for example, contains a diagram of a
square and its diagonals in which the number 30 is written along one
side and the numbers 42;25,35 and 1;24,51,10 appear along a diagonal.
The last number obviously is the ratio of the lengths of the diagonal
and a side, and this is so accurately expressed that it agrees with to
within about a millionth. The accuracy of the result was made possible
by knowledge of the Pythagorean theorem. Sometimes, in less precise
computations, the Babylonians used 1;25 as a rough-and-ready
approximation to this ratio. Of more significance than the precision of
the values, however, is the implication that the diagonal of any square
could be found by multiplying the side by . Thus, there seems to have
been some awareness of general principles, despite the fact that these
are exclusively expressed in special cases.</p>
<p>Babylonian recognition of the Pythagorean theorem was by no means
limited to the case of a right isosceles triangle. In one Old Babylonian
problem text, a ladder or a beam of length 0;30 stands against a wall;
the question is, how far will the lower end move out from the wall if
the upper end slips down a distance of 0;6 units? The answer is
correctly found by use of the Pythagorean theorem. Fifteen hundred years
later, similar problems, some with new twists, were still being solved
in the Mesopotamian Valley. A Seleucid tablet, for example, proposes the
following problem. A reed stands against a wall. If the top slides down
3 units when the lower end slides away 9 units, how long is the reed?
The answer is given correctly as 15 units.</p>
<p>Ancient cuneiform problem texts provide a wealth of exercises in what
we might call geometry, but which the Babylonians probably thought of as
applied arithmetic. A typical inheritance problem calls for the
partition of a right-triangular property among six brothers. The area is
given as 11,22,30 and one of the sides is 6,30; the dividing lines are
to be equidistant and parallel to the other side of the triangle. One is
asked to find the difference in the allotments. Another text gives the
bases of an isosceles trapezoid as 50 and 40 units and the length of the
sides as 30; the altitude and the area are required (van der Waerden
1963, pp. 76–77).</p>
<p>The ancient Babylonians were aware of other important geometric
relationships. Like the Egyptians, they knew that the altitude in an
isosceles triangle bisects the base. Hence, given the length of a chord
in a circle of known radius, they were able to find the apothem. Unlike
the Egyptians, they were familiar with the fact that an angle inscribed
in a semicircle is a right angle, a proposition generally known as the
Theorem of Thales, despite the fact that Thales lived more than a
millennium after the Babylonians had begun to use it. This misnaming of
a well-known theorem in geometry is symptomatic of the difficulty in
assessing the influence of pre-Hellenic mathematics on later cultures.
Cuneiform tablets had a permanence that could not be matched by
documents from other civilizations, for papyrus and parchment do not so
easily survive the ravages of time. Moreover, cuneiform texts continued
to be recorded down to the dawn of the Christian era, but were they read
by neighboring civilizations, especially the Greeks? The center of
mathematical development was shifting from the Mesopotamian Valley to
the Greek world half a dozen centuries before the beginning of our era,
but reconstructions of early Greek mathematics are rendered hazardous by
the fact that there are virtually no extant mathematical documents from
the pre-Hellenistic period. It is important, therefore, to keep in mind
the general characteristics of Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics so as
to be able to make at least plausible conjectures concerning analogies
that may be apparent between pre-Hellenic contributions and the
activities and attitudes of later peoples.</p>
<p>There is a lack of explicit statements of rules and of clear-cut
distinctions between exact and approximate results. The omission in the
tables of cases involving irregular sexagesimals seems to imply some
recognition of such distinctions, but neither the Egyptians nor the
Babylonians appear to have raised the question of when the area of a
quadrilateral (or of a circle) is found exactly and when only
approximately. Questions about the solvability or unsolvability of a
problem do not seem to have been raised, nor was there any investigation
into the nature of proof. The word “proof” means various things at
different levels and ages; hence, it is hazardous to assert
categorically that pre-Hellenic peoples had no concept of proof, nor any
feeling of the need for proof. There are hints that these people were
occasionally aware that certain area and volume methods could be
justified through a reduction to simpler area and volume problems.
Moreover, pre-Hellenic scribes not infrequently checked or “proved”
their divisions by multiplication; occasionally, they verified the
procedure in a problem through a substitution that verified the
correctness of the answer. Nevertheless, there are no explicit
statements from the pre-Hellenic period that would indicate a felt need
for proofs or a concern for questions of logical principles. In
Mesopotamian problems, the words “length” and “width” should perhaps be
interpreted much as we interpret the letters x and y, for the writers of
cuneiform tablets may well have moved on from specific instances to
general abstractions. How else does one explain the addition of a length
to an area? In Egypt also, the use of the word for quantity is not
incompatible with an abstract interpretation such as we read into it
today. In addition, there were in Egypt and Babylonia problems that have
the earmarks of recreational mathematics. If a problem calls for a sum
of cats and measures of grain, or of a length and an area, one cannot
deny to the perpetrator either a modicum of levity or a feeling for
abstraction. Of course, much of pre-Hellenic mathematics was practical,
but surely not all of it. In the practice of computation, which
stretched over a couple of millennia, the schools of scribes used plenty
of exercise material, often, perhaps, simply as good clean fun.</p>
