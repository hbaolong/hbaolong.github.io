<h4 id="non-euclidean-geometry">Non-Euclidean Geometry</h4>
<p>In non-Euclidean geometry, we find a startling case of simultaneity
of discovery, for similar notions occurred, during the first third of
the nineteenth century, to three men, one German, one Hungarian, and one
Russian. We have already noted that during the second decade of the
century, Gauss had come to the conclusion that the efforts to prove the
parallel postulate made by Saccheri, Lambert, Legendre, and his
Hungarian friend Farkas Bolyai were in vain and that geometries other
than Euclid’s were possible. Yet he had not shared this view with
others; he had simply elaborated the idea, as he said, “for himself.”
Hence, efforts to prove the parallel postulate continued, and among
those attempting such a proof was young Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky
(1793 1856). Lobachevsky is regarded as the “Copernicus of geometry,”
the man who revolutionized the subject through the creation of a whole
new branch, Lobachevskian geometry, thereby showing that Euclidean
geometry was not the exact science or the absolute truth it previously
had been taken to be. Through the work of Lobachevsky, it became
necessary to revise fundamental views of the nature of mathematics, but
Lobachevsky’s colleagues were too close to the situation to see it in
proper perspective, and the trailblazer had to pursue his thoughts in
lonely isolation.</p>
<p>Lobachevsky’s revolutionary view seems not to have come to him as a
sudden inspiration. In an outline of geometry that he drew up in 1823,
presumably for classroom use, Lobachevsky said of the parallel postulate
simply that “no rigorous proof of the truth of this had ever been
discovered.” Apparently, he did not then exclude the possibility that
such a proof might yet be discovered. Three years later at Kazan
University, he read in French a paper (now lost) on the principles of
geometry, including “une de´monstration rigoreuse du
the´ore<code>me des paralle</code>les.” The year 1826 in which this
paper was delivered may be taken as the unofficial birth date of
Lobachevskian geometry, for it was then that the author presented many
of the characteristic theorems of the new subject. Another three years
later, in the Kazan Messenger for 1829, Lobachevsky published an
article, “On the Principles of Geometry,”</p>
<p>Non Euc lide an Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>which marks the official birth of non-Euclidean geometry. Between
1826 and 1829, he had become thoroughly convinced that Euclid’s fifth
postulate cannot be proved on the basis of the other four, and in the
paper of 1829, he became the first mathematician to take the
revolutionary step of publishing a geometry specifically built on an
assumption in direct conflict with the parallel postulate: Through a
point C lying outside a line AB there can be drawn more than one line in
the plane and not meeting AB. With this new postulate, Lobachevsky
deduced a harmonious geometric structure having no inherent logical
contradictions. This was in every sense a valid geometry, but so
contrary to common sense did it appear, even to Lobachevsky, that he
called it “imaginary geometry.”</p>
<p>Lobachevsky was well aware of the significance of his discovery of
“imaginary geometry,” as is clear from the fact that during the score of
years from 1835 to 1855, he wrote out three full accounts of the new
geometry. In 1835 1838, his New Foundations of Geometry appeared in
Russian; in 1840, he published Geometrical Investigations on the Theory
of Parallels in German; and in 1855, his last book, Pangeometry, was
published simultaneously in French and Russian. (All have since been
translated into other languages, including English.) From the second of
the three works, Gauss learned of Lobachevsky’s contributions to
nonEuclidean geometry, and it was on his recommendation that in 1842,
Lobachevsky was elected to the Go¨ttingen Scientific Society. In letters
to friends, Gauss praised Lobachevsky’s work, but he never gave it
support in print, for he feared the jibes of “the Boeotians.” Partly for
this reason, the new geometry became known only very slowly.</p>
<p>Gauss’s Hungarian friend Farkas Bolyai had spent much of his life
trying to prove the parallel postulate, and when he found that his own
son Janos Bolyai (1802 1860) was absorbed in the problem of parallels,
the father, a provincial mathematics teacher, wrote to the son, a
dashing army officer:</p>
<p>For God’s sake, I beseech you, give it up. Fear it no less than
sensual passions because it, too, may take all your time, and deprive
you of your health, peace of mind, and happiness in life.</p>
<p>The son, not dissuaded, continued his efforts until, in about 1829,
he came to the conclusion reached only a few years earlier by
Lobachevsky. Instead of attempting to prove the impossible, he developed
what he called the “Absolute Science of Space,” starting from the
assumption that through a point not on a line, infinitely many lines can
be drawn in the plane, each parallel to the given line. Janos sent his
reflections to his father, who published them in the form of an appendix
to a treatise that he had completed, bearing a long Latin title
beginning with Tentamen. The elder Bolyai’s Tentamen bears an imprimatur
dated 1829, the year of Lobachevsky’s Kazan Messenger article, but it
did not actually appear until 1832.</p>
<p>Gauss’s reaction to the “Absolute Science of Space” was similar to
that in the case of Lobachevsky—sincere approval, but lack of support in
print. When Farkas Bolyai wrote to ask for an opinion on the unorthodox
work of his son, Gauss replied that he could not praise Janos’s work,
for this would mean self-praise, inasmuch as he had held these views for
many years. The temperamental Janos was understandably disturbed,
fearing that he would be deprived of priority. Continued lack of
recognition, as well as the publication of Lobachevsky’s work in German
in 1840, so upset him that he published nothing more. The lion’s share
of the credit for the development of non-Euclidean geometry consequently
belongs to Lobachevsky.</p>
<p>Riemannian Geometry</p>
<p>Non-Euclidean geometry continued for several decades to be a fringe
aspect of mathematics until it was thoroughly integrated through the
remarkably general views of G. F. B. Riemann (1826 1866). The son of a
village pastor, Riemann was brought up in very modest circumstances,
always remaining frail in body and shy in manner. He nevertheless
secured a good education, first at Berlin and later at Go¨ttingen, where
he took his doctorate with a thesis in theory of functions of a complex
variable. It is here that we find the so-called Cauchy-Riemann
equations, ux 5vy, uy 52vx, which an analytic function w5f(z)5u1iv of a
complex variable z5x1iy must satisfy, although this requirement had been
known even in the days of Euler and d’Alembert. The thesis also led to
the concept of a Riemann surface, anticipating the part that topology
ultimately was to play in analysis.</p>
<p>In 1854, Riemann became a privatdozent at the University of
Go¨ttingen, and according to custom, he was called on to deliver a
Habilitationsschrift before the faculty. The result, in Riemann’s case,
was the most celebrated probationary lecture in the history of
mathematics, for it presented a deep and broad view of the whole field
of geometry. The thesis bore the title “U¨ ber die Hypothesen welche der
Geometrie zu Grunde liegen”
(“OntheHypotheseswhichLieattheFoundationofGeometry”),butitdid not
present a specific example. It instead urged a global view of geometry
as a study of manifolds of any number of dimensions in any kind of
space. His geometries are non-Euclidean in a far more general sense than
is Lobachevskian geometry, where the question is simply how many
parallels are possible through a point. Riemann saw that geometry should
not even necessarily deal with points or lines or space in the ordinary
sense, but with sets of ordered n-tuples that are combined according to
certain rules.</p>
<p>Rie mannian Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>Among the most important rules in any geometry, Riemann saw, is that
for finding the distance between two points that are infinitesimally
close together. In ordinary Euclidean geometry, this “metric” is given
by ds2 5dx2 1dy2 1dz2, but infinitely many other formulas can be used as
a distance formula, and, of course, the metric used will determine the
propertiesofthespaceorthegeometry.Aspacewhosemetricisoftheform</p>
<p>ds2 5g11 dx2 1g12 dxdy1g13 dxdz</p>
<p>1g21 dydx1g22 dy2 1g23 dydz</p>
<p>1g13 dzdx1g23 dzdy1g33 dz2;</p>
<p>where the g’s are constants or, more generally, functions of x, y,
and z, is known as a Riemannian space. Thus, (locally) Euclidean space
is only the very special case of a Riemannian space in which g11 5g22 5
g33 51 and all the other g’s are zero. Riemann even developed from the
metric a formula for the Gaussian curvature of a “surface” in his
“space.” It is no wonder that after Riemann’s lecture and for almost the
only time in his long career, Gauss expressed enthusiasm for the work of
someone else.</p>
<p>There is a more restricted sense in which we today use the phrase
“Riemannian geometry”: the plane geometry that is deduced from
Saccheri’s hypothesis of the obtuse angle if the infinitude of the
straight line is also abandoned. A model for this geometry is found in
the interpretation of the “plane” as the surface of a sphere and of a
“straight line” as a great circle on the sphere. In this case, the angle
sum of a triangle is greater than two right angles, whereas in the
geometry of Lobachevsky and Bolyai (corresponding to the hypothesis of
the acute angle), the angle sum is less than two right angles. This use
of Riemann’s name, however, fails to do justice to the fundamental
change in geometric thought that his 1854 Habilitationsschrift (not
published until 1867) brought about. It was Riemann’s suggestion of the
general study of curved metric spaces, rather than of the special case
equivalent to geometry on the sphere, that ultimately made the theory of
general relativity possible. Riemann himself contributed heavily to
theoretical physics in a number of directions, and it was therefore
fitting that in 1859 he should have been appointed as successor to
Dirichlet in the chair at Go¨ttingen that Gauss had filled.</p>
<p>In showing that non-Euclidean geometry with angle sum greater than
two right angles is realized on the surface of a sphere, Riemann
essentially verified the consistency of the axioms from which the
geometry is derived. In much the same sense, Eugenio Beltrami (1835
1900), a colleague of Cremona’s at Bologna and later a professor at
Pisa, Pavia, and Rome, showed that there was at hand a corresponding
model for Lobachevskian geometry. This is the surface generated through
the revolution of a tractrix about its asymptote, a surface known as a
pseudosphere, inasmuch as it has constant negative curvature, as the
sphere has constant positive curvature.</p>
<p>If we define the “straight line” through two points on the
pseudosphere as the geodesic through the points, the resulting geometry
will have the properties resulting from the Lobachevskian postulates.
Inasmuch as the plane is a surface with constant zero curvature,
Euclidean geometry can be regarded as an intermediary between the two
types of nonEuclidean geometry.</p>
