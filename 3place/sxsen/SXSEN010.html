<p>Did you bring me a man who cannot number his fingers?</p>
<p>From the Egyptian Book of the Dead</p>
<h4 id="concepts-and-relationships-本章字典">Concepts and Relationships
<a href="./dicts/dict.5103数学史EN_010.html">本章字典</a></h4>
<p>Contemporary mathematicians formulate statements about abstract
concepts that are subject to verification by proof. For centuries,
mathematics was considered to be the science of numbers, magnitudes, and
forms. For that reason, those who seek early examples of mathematical
activity will point to archaeological remnants that reflect human
awareness of operations on numbers, counting, or “geometric” patterns
and shapes. Even when these vestiges reflect mathematical activity, they
rarely evidence muchhistorical significance.Theymaybe
interestingwhentheyshowthat peoples in different parts of the world
conducted certain actions dealing with concepts that have been
considered mathematical. For such an action to assume historical
significance, however, we look for relationships that indicate this
action was known to another individual or group that engaged
inarelatedaction.Oncesuchaconnectionhasbeenestablished,thedooris open to
more specifically historical studies, such as those dealing with
transmission, tradition, and conceptual change.</p>
<p>Mathematical vestiges are often found in the domain of nonliterate
cultures, making the evaluation of their significance even more complex.
Rules of operation may exist as part of an oral tradition, often in
musical or verse form, or they may be clad in the language of magic or
ritual. Sometimes they are found in observations of animal behavior,
removing them even further from the realm of the historian. While
studies of canine arithmetic or avian geometry belong to the zoologist,
of the impact of brain lesions on number sense to the neurologist, and
of numerical healing incantations to the anthropologist, all of these
studies may prove to be useful to the historian of mathematics without
being an overt part of that history.</p>
<p>At first, the notions of number, magnitude, and form may have been
related to contrasts rather than likenesses—the difference between one
wolf and many, the inequality in size of a minnow and a whale, the
unlikeness of the roundness of the moon and the straightness of a pine
tree. Gradually, there may have arisen, out of the welter of chaotic
experiences, the realization that there are samenesses, and from this
awareness of similarities in number and form both science and
mathematics were born. The differences themselves seem to point to
likenesses, for the contrast between one wolf and many, between one
sheep and a herd, between one tree and a forest suggests that one wolf,
one sheep, and one tree have something in common—their uniqueness. In
the same way it would be noticed that certain other groups, such as
pairs, can be put into one-to-one correspondence. The hands can be
matched against the feet, the eyes, the ears, or the nostrils. This
recognition of an abstract property that certain groups hold in common,
and that we call “number,” represents a long step toward modern
mathematics. It is unlikely to have been the discovery of any one
individual or any single tribe; it was more probably a gradual awareness
that may have developed as early in man’s cultural development as the
use of fire, possibly some 300,000 years ago.</p>
<p>That the development of the number concept was a long and gradual
process is suggested by the fact that some languages, including Greek,
have preserved in their grammar a tripartite distinction between 1 and 2
and more than 2, whereas most languages today make only the dual
distinction in “number” between singular and plural. Evidently, our very
early ancestors at first counted only to 2, and any set beyond this
level was designated as “many.” Even today, many people still count
objects by arranging them into sets of two each.</p>
<p>The awareness of number ultimately became sufficiently extended and
vivid so that a need was felt to express the property in some way,
presumably at first in sign language only. The fingers on a hand can be
readily used to indicate a set of two or three or four or five objects,
the number 1 generally not being recognized at first as a true “number.”
By the use of the fingers on both hands, collections containing up to
ten elements could be represented; by combining fingers and toes, one
could count as high as 20. When the human digits were inadequate, heaps
of stones or knotted strings could be used to represent a correspondence
with the elements of another set. Where nonliterate peoples used such a
scheme of representation, they often piled the stones in groups of five,
for they had become familiar with quintuples through observation of the
human hand and foot. As Aristotle noted long ago, the widespread use
today of the decimal system is but the result of the anatomical accident
that most of us are born with ten fingers and ten toes.</p>
<p>Groups of stones are too ephemeral for the preservation of
information; hence, prehistoric man sometimes made a number record by
cutting notches in a stick or a piece of bone. Few of these records
remain today, but in Moravia a bone from a young wolf was found that is
deeply incised with fifty-five notches. These are arranged in two
series, with twenty-five in the first and thirty in the second: within
each series, the notches are arranged in groups of five. It has been
dated as being approximately 30,000 years old. Two other prehistoric
numerical artifacts were found in Africa: a baboon fibula having
twenty-nine notches, dated as being circa 35,000 years old, and the
Ishango bone, with its apparent examples of multiplicative entries,
initially dated as approximately 8,000 years old but now estimated to be
as much as 30,000 years old as well. Such archaeological discoveries
provide evidence that the idea of number is far older than previously
acknowledged.</p>
