<h4 id="chapter-6-archimedes-of-syracuse">Chapter 6 Archimedes of
Syracuse</h4>
<p>There was more imagination in the head of Archimedes than in that of
Homer.</p>
<p>—Voltaire</p>
<p>The Siege of Syracuse</p>
<p>During the Second Punic War, the city of Syracuse was caught in the
power struggle between Rome and Carthage, and the city was besieged by
the Romans for three years beginning in 214 BCE. We are told that
throughout the siege, Archimedes, the leading mathematician of the age,
invented ingenious war machines to keep the enemy at bay—catapults to
hurl stones; ropes, pulleys, and hooks to raise and smash the Roman
ships; devices to set fire to the ships. Ultimately, however, during the
sack of the city in 212, Archimedes was slain by a Roman soldier,
despite orders from the Roman general Marcellus that the life of the
geometer be spared. Inasmuch as Archimedes at the time is reported to
have been seventy-five years old, he was most likely born in 287 BCE.
His father was an astronomer, and Archimedes also established a
reputation in astronomy. Marcellus is said to have reserved for himself,
as booty, ingenious planetaria that Archimedes had constructed to
portray the motions of the heavenly bodies. Accounts of the life of
Archimedes are in agreement, however, in depicting him as placing less
value in his mechanical contrivances than in the unusually innovative
approach to abstract products of his thought. Even when dealing with
levers and other simple machines, he was reputedly more concerned with
general principles than with practical applications. Nearly a dozen
works survive that illustrate the problems that interested him.</p>
<p>On the Equilibriums of Planes</p>
<p>Archimedes was not the first to use the lever or even the first to
formulate the general law of the lever. Aristotelian works contain the
statement that two weights on a lever balance when they are inversely
proportional to their distances from the fulcrum, and the Peripatetics
associated the law with their assumption that vertical rectilinear
motion is the only natural terrestrial motion. Archimedes, on the other
hand, deduced the law from a more plausible static postulate—that
bilaterally symmetric bodies are in equilibrium. That is, let one assume
that a weightless bar four units long and supporting three unit weights,
one at either end and one in the middle (Fig. 6.1), is balanced by a
fulcrum at the center. By the Archimedean axiom of symmetry, the system
is in equilibrium. But the principle of symmetry also shows that
considering only the right-hand half of the system, the balancing effect
will remain the same if the two weights two units apart are brought
together at the midpoint of the right-hand side. This means that a unit
weight two units from the fulcrum will support on the other arm a weight
of two units that is one unit from the fulcrum. Through a generalization
of this procedure, Archimedes established the law of the lever on static
principles alone, without recourse to the Aristotelian kinematic
argument. After examining the history of these concepts during the
medieval period, one concludes that a conjunction of static and
kinematic views produced advances in both science and mathematics.</p>
<p>FIG. 6.1</p>
<p>Archimedes’ work on the law of the lever is part of his treatise, in
two books, On the Equilibriums of Planes. This is not the oldest extant
book on what may be called physical science, for about a century
earlier, Aristotle had published an influential work, in eight books,
titled Physics. But whereas the Aristotelian approach was speculative
and nonmathematical, the Archimedean development was similar to the
geometry of Euclid. From a set of simple postulates, Archimedes deduced
deep conclusions, establishing the close relationship between
mathematics and mechanics that was to become so significant for both
physics and mathematics.</p>
<p>On Floating Bodies</p>
<p>Archimedes can well be called the father of mathematical physics, not
only for his On the Equilibriums of Planes, but also for another
treatise, in two books, On Floating Bodies. Again, beginning from a
simple postulate about the nature of fluid pressure, he obtained some
very deep results. Among the earlier propositions are two that formulate
the well-known Archimedean hydrostatic principle:</p>
<p>Any solid lighter than a fluid will, if placed in a fluid, be so far
immersed that the weight of the solid will be equal to the weight of the
fluid displaced (I.5).</p>
<p>A solid heavier than a fluid will, if placed in it, descend to the
bottom of the fluid, and the solid will, when weighed in the fluid, be
lighter than its true weight by the weight of the fluid displaced
(I.7).</p>
<p>The mathematical derivation of this principle of buoyancy is
undoubtedly the discovery that led the absentminded Archimedes to jump
from his bath and run home naked, shouting, “Eureka!” (“I have found
it!”). It is also possible, although less likely, that the principle
aided him in checking on the honesty of a goldsmith suspected of
fraudulently substituting some silver for gold in a crown (or, more
likely, a wreath) made for King Hieron II of Syracuse. Such fraud could
easily have been detected by the simpler method of comparing the
densities of gold, silver, and the crown by measuring displacements of
water when equal weights of each are in turn immersed in a vessel full
of water.</p>
<p>The Archimedean treatise On Floating Bodies contains much more than
the simple fluid properties so far described. Virtually the whole of
Book II, for example, is concerned with the position of equilibrium of
segments of paraboloids when placed in fluids, showing that the position
of rest depends on the relative specific gravities of the solid
paraboloid and the fluid in which it floats. Typical of these is
Proposition 4:</p>
<p>Given a right segment of a paraboloid of revolution whose axis a is
greater than (where p is the parameter), and whose specific gravity is
less than that of a fluid but bears to it a ratio not less than , if the
segment of the paraboloid be placed in the fluid with its axis at any
inclination to the vertical, but so that its base does not touch the
surface of the fluid, it will not remain in that position but will
return to the position in which its axis is vertical.</p>
<p>Still more complicated cases, with long proofs, follow. It was
probably through his Alexandrian contacts that Archimedes became
interested in the technical problem of raising water from the Nile River
to irrigate the arable portions of the valley; for this purpose he
invented a device, now known as the Archimedean screw, made up of
helical pipes or tubes fastened to an inclined axle with a handle by
which it was rotated. He is supposed to have boasted that if he were
given a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to rest it, he could
move the earth.</p>
<p>The Sand-Reckoner</p>
<p>A clear distinction was made in Greek antiquity not only between
theory and application, but also between routine mechanical computation
and the theoretical study of the properties of number. The former, for
which Greek scholars are said to have shown scorn, was given the name
logistic, while arithmetic, an honorable philosophical pursuit, was
understood to be concerned solely with the latter.</p>
<p>Archimedes lived at about the time that the transition from Attic to
Ionian numeration was effected, and this may account for the fact that
he stooped to make a contribution to logistic. In a work titled the
Psammites (Sand-Reckoner), Archimedes boasted that he could write down a
number greater than the number of grains of sand required to fill the
universe. In doing so, he referred to one of the boldest astronomical
speculations of antiquity—that in which Aristarchus of Samos, toward the
middle of the third century BCE, proposed putting the earth in motion
about the sun. Aristarchus asserted that a lack of parallax can be
attributed to the enormity of the distance of the fixed stars from the
earth. Now, to make good his boast, Archimedes had to provide against
all possible dimensions for the universe, so he showed that he could
enumerate the grains of sand needed to fill even Aristarchus’s immense
world.</p>
<p>For the universe of Aristarchus, which is to the ordinary universe as
the latter is to the earth, Archimedes showed that not more than 1063
grains of sand are required. Archimedes did not use this notation but
instead described the number as ten million units of the eighth order of
numbers (where the numbers of second order begin with a myriad-myriads
and the numbers of eighth order begin with the seventh power of a
myriad-myriads). To show that he could express numbers ever so much
larger even than this, Archimedes extended his terminology to call all
numbers of order less than a myriad-myriads those of the first period,
the second period consequently beginning with the number (108)108, one
that would contain 800,000,000 ciphers. That is, his system would go up
to a number that would be written as 1 followed by some eighty thousand
million millions of ciphers. It was in connection with this work on huge
numbers that Archimedes mentioned, all too incidentally, a principle
that later led to the invention of logarithms—the addition of “orders”
of numbers (the equivalent of their exponents when the base is
100,000,000) corresponds to finding the product of the numbers.</p>
<p>Measurement of the Circle</p>
<p>In his approximate evaluation of the ratio of the circumference to
diameter for a circle, Archimedes again showed his skill in computation.
Beginning with the inscribed regular hexagon, he computed the perimeters
of polygons obtained by successively doubling the number of sides until
one reached ninety-six sides. His iterative procedure for these polygons
was related to what is sometimes called the Archimedean algorithm. One
sets out the sequence Pn, pn, P2n, p2n, P4n, p4n . . . , where Pn and pn
are the perimeters of the circumscribed and inscribed regular polygons
of n sides. Beginning with the third term, one calculates any term from
the two preceding terms by taking alternately their harmonic and
geometric means. That is, , and so on. If one prefers, one can use
instead the sequence an, An, a2n, A2n, . . ., where an and An are the
areas of the inscribed and circumscribed regular polygons of n sides.
The third and successive terms are calculated by taking alternately the
geometric and harmonic means, so that , and so on. His method for
computing square roots, in finding the perimeter of the circumscribed
hexagon, and for the geometric means was similar to that used by the
Babylonians. The result of the Archimedean computation on the circle was
an approximation to the value of π expressed by the inequality , a
better estimate than those of the Egyptians and the Babylonians. (It
should be borne in mind that neither Archimedes nor any other Greek
mathematician ever used our notation π for the ratio of circumference to
diameter in a circle.) This result was given in Proposition 3 of the
treatise on the Measurement of the Circle, one of the most popular of
the Archimedean works during the medieval period.</p>
<p>On Spirals</p>
<p>Archimedes, like his predecessors, was attracted by the three famous
problems of geometry, and the well-known Archimedean spiral provided
solutions to two of these (but not, of course, with straightedge and
compass alone). The spiral is defined as the plane locus of a point that
when starting from the end point of a ray or half line, moves uniformly
along this ray, while the ray in turn rotates uniformly about its end
point. In polar coordinates, the equation of the spiral is r = aθ. Given
such a spiral, the trisection of an angle is easily accomplished. The
angle is so placed that the vertex and the initial side of the angle
coincide with the initial point O of the spiral and the initial position
OA of the rotating line. Segment OP, where P is the intersection of the
terminal side of the angle with the spiral, is then trisected at points
R and S (Fig. 6.2), and circles are drawn with O as center and OR and OS
as radii. If these circles intersect the spiral in points U and V, lines
OH and OV will trisect the angle AOP.</p>
<p>FIG. 6.2</p>
<p>Greek mathematics has sometimes been described as essentially static,
with little regard for the notion of variability, but Archimedes, in his
study of the spiral, apparently found the tangent to a curve through
kinematic considerations akin to the differential calculus. Thinking of
a point on the spiral r = aθ as subjected to a double motion—a uniform
radial motion away from the origin of coordinates and a circular motion
about the origin—he seems to have found (through the parallelogram of
velocities) the direction of motion (hence of the tangent to the curve)
by noting the resultant of the two component motions. This appears to be
the first instance in which a tangent was found to a curve other than a
circle.</p>
<p>Archimedes’ study of the spiral, a curve that he ascribed to his
friend Conon of Alexandria, was part of the Greek search for solutions
of the three famous problems. The curve lends itself so readily to angle
multisections that it may well have been devised by Conon for this
purpose. As in the case of the quadratrix, however, it can also serve to
square the circle, as Archimedes showed. At point P let the tangent to
the spiral OPR be drawn and let this tangent intersect in point Q the
line through O that is perpendicular to OP. Then, as Archimedes showed,
the straight-line segment OQ (known as the polar subtangent for point P)
is equal in length to the circular arc PS of the circle with center O
and radius OP (Fig. 6.3) that is intercepted between the initial line
(polar axis) and line OP (radius vector). This theorem, proved by
Archimedes through a typical double reductio ad absurdum demonstration,
can be verified by a student of the calculus who recalls that tan ψ =
r/r′, where r = f(θ) is the polar equation of a curve, r′ is the
derivative of r with respect to θ, and ψ is the angle between the radius
vector at a point P and the tangent line to the curve at the point P. A
large part of the work of Archimedes is such that it would now be
included in a calculus course; this is particularly true of the work On
Spirals. If point P on the spiral is chosen as the intersection of the
spiral with the 90° line in polar coordinates, the polar subtangent OQ
will be precisely equal to a quarter of the circumference of the circle
of radius OP. Hence, the entire circumference is easily constructed as
four times the segment OQ, and by Archimedes’ theorem, a triangle equal
in area to the area of the circle is found. A simple geometric
transformation will then produce a square in place of the triangle, and
the quadrature of the circle is effected.</p>
<p>FIG. 6.3</p>
<p>Quadrature of the Parabola</p>
<p>The work On Spirals was much admired but little read, for it was
generally regarded as the most difficult of all Archimedean works. Of
the treatises concerned chiefly with “the method of exhaustion,” the
most popular was Quadrature of the Parabola. The conic sections had been
known for almost a century when Archimedes wrote it, yet no progress had
been made in finding their areas. It took the greatest mathematician of
antiquity to square a conic section—a segment of the parabola—which he
accomplished in Proposition 17 of the work in which the quadrature was
the goal. The proof by the standard Eudoxean method of exhaustion is
long and involved, but Archimedes rigorously proved that the area K of a
parabolic segment APBQC (Fig. 6.4) is four-thirds the area of a triangle
T having the same base and equal height. In the succeeding (and last)
seven propositions, Archimedes gave a second but different proof of the
same theorem. He first showed that the area of the largest inscribed
triangle, ABC, on the base AC is four times the sum of the corresponding
inscribed triangles on each of the lines AB and BC as base. If you
continue the process suggested by this relationship, it becomes clear
that the area K of the parabolic segment ABC is given by the sum of the
infinite series which, of course, is . Archimedes did not refer to the
sum of the infinite series, for infinite processes were frowned on in
his day; instead, he proved by a double reductio ad absurdum that K can
be neither more nor less than . (Archimedes, like his predecessors, did
not use the name “parabola” but the word “orthotome,” or “section of a
right cone.”)</p>
<p>FIG. 6.4</p>
<p>In the preamble to Quadrature of the Parabola, we find the assumption
or lemma that is usually known today as the axiom of Archimedes: “That
the excess by which the greater of two unequal areas exceeds the less
can, by being added to itself, be made to exceed any given finite area.”
This axiom in effect rules out the fixed infinitesimal or indivisible
that had been much discussed in Plato’s day. Archimedes freely admitted
that</p>
<p>the earlier geometers have also used this lemma, for it is by the use
of this same lemma that they have shown that circles are to one another
in the duplicate ratio of their diameters, and that spheres are to one
another in the triplicate ratio of their diameters, and further that
every pyramid is one third part of the prism which has the same base
with the pyramid and equal height; also, that every cone is one third
part of the cylinder having the same base as the cone and equal height
they proved by assuming a certain lemma similar to that aforesaid.</p>
<p>The “earlier geometers” mentioned here presumably included Eudoxus
and his successors.</p>
<p>On Conoids and Spheroids</p>
<p>Archimedes apparently was unable to find the area of a general
segment of an ellipse or a hyperbola. Finding the area of a parabolic
segment by modern integration involves nothing worse than polynomials,
but the integrals arising in the quadrature of a segment of an ellipse
or a hyperbola (as well as the arcs of these curves or the parabola)
require transcendental functions. Nevertheless, in his important
treatise On Conoids and Spheroids, Archimedes found the area of the
entire ellipse: “The areas of ellipses are as the rectangles under their
axes” (Proposition 6). This is, of course, the same as saying that the
area of x2/a2 + y2/b2 = 1 is πab or that the area of an ellipse is the
same as the area of a circle whose radius is the geometric mean of the
semiaxes of the ellipse. Moreover, in the same treatise Archimedes
showed how to find the volumes of segments cut from an ellipsoid or a
paraboloid or a hyperboloid (of two sheets) of revolution about the
principal axis. The process that he used is so nearly the same as that
in modern integration that we shall describe it for one case. Let ABC be
a paraboloidal segment (or paraboloidal “conoid”) and let its axis be CD
(Fig. 6.5); about the solid circumscribe the circular cylinder ABFE,
also having CD as axis. Divide the axis into n equal parts of length h,
and through the points of division pass planes parallel to the base. On
the circular sections that are cut from the paraboloid by these planes,
construct inscribed and circumscribed cylindrical frusta, as shown in
the figure. It is then easy to establish, through the equation of the
parabola and the sum of an arithmetic progression, the following
proportions and inequalities:</p>
<p>FIG. 6.5</p>
<p>Archimedes had previously shown that the difference in volume between
the circumscribed and inscribed figures was equal to the volume of the
lowest slice of the circumscribed cylinder; by increasing the number n
of subdivisions on the axis, thereby making each slice thinner, the
difference between the circumscribed and inscribed figures can be made
less than any preassigned magnitude. Hence, the inequalities lead to the
necessary conclusion that the volume of the cylinder is twice the volume
of the conoidal segment. This work differs from the modern procedure in
integral calculus chiefly in the lack of the concept of limit of a
function—a concept that was so near at hand and yet was never formulated
by the ancients, not even by Archimedes, the man who came closest to
achieving it.</p>
<p>On the Sphere and Cylinder</p>
<p>Archimedes composed many marvelous treatises; his successors were
inclined to admire most the one On Spirals. The author himself seems to
have been partial to another, On the Sphere and Cylinder. Archimedes
requested that on his tomb be carved a representation of a sphere
inscribed in a right circular cylinder the height of which is equal to
its diameter, for he had discovered and proved that the ratio of the
volumes of cylinder and sphere is the same as the ratio of the
areas—that is, 3 to 2. This property, which Archimedes discovered
subsequent to his Quadrature of the Parabola, remained unknown, he said,
to geometers before him. It had once been thought that the Egyptians
knew how to find the area of a hemisphere, but Archimedes now appears to
be the first one to have known and proved that the area of a sphere is
just four times the area of a great circle of the sphere. Moreover,
Archimedes showed that “the surface of any segment of a sphere is equal
to a circle whose radius is equal to the straight line drawn from the
vertex of the segment to the circumference of the circle which is the
base of the segment.” This, of course, is equivalent to the more
familiar statement that the surface area of any segment of a sphere is
equal to that of the curved surface of a cylinder whose radius is the
same as that of the sphere and whose height is the same as that of the
segment. That is, the surface area of the segment does not depend on the
distance from the center of the sphere, but only on the altitude (or
thickness) of the segment. The crucial theorem on the surface of the
sphere appears in Proposition 33, following a long series of preliminary
theorems, including one that is equivalent to an integration of the sine
function:</p>
<p>If a polygon be inscribed in a segment of a circle LAL′ so that all
its sides excluding the base are equal and their number even, as LK. .
.A. . .K′L′, A being the middle point of the segment; and if the lines
BB′, CC′, . . .parallel to the base LL′ and joining pairs of angular
points be drawn, then (BB′ + CC′ + . . . + LM):AM = A′B: BA, where M is
the middle point of LL′ and AA′ is the diameter through M [Fig.
6.6].</p>
<p>FIG. 6.6</p>
<p>This is the geometric equivalent of the trigonometric equation</p>
<p>From this theorem, it is easy to derive the modern expression by
multiplying both sides of the previous equation by θ/n and taking limits
as n increases indefinitely. The left-hand side becomes</p>
<p>where xi = iθ/n for i = 1, 2, . . .n, Δxi = θ/n for i = 1, 2, . . .n
– 1, and Δxn = θ/2n. The right-hand side becomes</p>
<p>The equivalent of the special case had been given by Archimedes in
the preceding proposition.</p>
<p>An interesting light on Greek geometric algebra is cast by a problem
in Book II of On the Sphere and Cylinder. In Proposition 2, Archimedes
justified his formula for the volume of a segment of a given sphere; in
Proposition 3, he showed that to cut a given sphere by a plane so that
the surfaces of the segments are in a given ratio, one simply passes a
plane perpendicular to a diameter through a point on the diameter that
divides the diameter into two segments having the desired ratio. He then
showed in Proposition 4 how to cut a given sphere so that the volumes of
the two segments are in a given ratio—a far more difficult problem. In
modern notation, Archimedes was led to the equation</p>
<p>where m: n is the ratio of the segments. This is a cubic equation,
and Archimedes attacked its solution as had his predecessors in solving
the Delian problem—through intersecting conics. Interestingly, the Greek
approach to the cubic was quite different from that to the quadratic
equation. By analogy with the “application of areas” in the latter case,
we would anticipate an “application of volumes,” but this was not
adopted. Through substitutions, Archimedes reduced his cubic equation to
the form x2(c−x) = db2 and promised to give separately a complete
analysis of this cubic with respect to the number of positive roots.
This analysis had apparently been lost for many centuries when Eutocius,
an important commentator of the early sixth century, found a fragment
that seems to contain the authentic Archimedean analysis. The solution
was carried out by means of the intersection of the parabola cx2 = b2y
and the hyperbola (c−x)y = cd. Going further, he found a condition on
the coefficients that determines the number of real roots satisfying the
given requirements—a condition equivalent to finding the discriminant,
27b2d−4c3, of the cubic equation b2d = x2(c−x). Inasmuch as all cubic
equations can be transformed to the Archimedean type, we have here the
essence of a complete analysis of the general cubic.</p>
<p>Book of Lemmas</p>
<p>Most of the Archimedean treatises that we have described are a part
of advanced mathematics, but the great Syracusan was not above proposing
elementary problems. In his Book of Lemmas, for example, we find a study
of the so-called arbelos, or “shoemaker’s knife.” The shoemaker’s knife
is the region bounded by the three semicircles tangent in pairs in Fig.
6.7, the area in question being that which lies inside the largest
semicircle and outside the two smallest. Archimedes showed in
Proposition 4 that if CD is perpendicular to AB, the area of the circle
with CD as diameter is equal to the area of the arbelos. In the next
proposition, it is shown that the two circles inscribed within the two
regions into which CD divides the shoemaker’s knife are equal.</p>
<p>FIG. 6.7</p>
<p>It is in the Book of Lemmas that we also find (as Proposition 8) the
well-known Archimedean trisection of the angle. Let ABC be the angle to
be trisected (Fig. 6.8). Then, with B as center, draw a circle of any
radius intersecting AB in P and BC in Q, with BC extended in R. Then,
draw a line STP such that S lies on CQBR extended and T lies on the
circle and such that ST = BQ = BP = BT. It is then readily shown,
because triangles STB and TBP are isosceles, that angle BST is precisely
a third of angle QBP, the angle that was to have been trisected.
Archimedes and his contemporaries were, of course, aware that this is
not a canonical trisection in the Platonic sense, for it involves what
they called a neusis—that is, an insertion of a given length, in this
case ST = BQ, between two figures, here the line QR extended, and the
circle.</p>
<p>FIG. 6.8</p>
<p>The Book of Lemmas has not survived in the original Greek, but
through Arabic translation that later was turned into Latin. (Hence, it
is often cited by its Latin title of Liber assumptorum.) In fact, the
work as it has come down to us cannot be genuinely Archimedean, for his
name is quoted several times within the text. Yet, even if the treatise
is nothing more than a collection of miscellaneous theorems that were
attributed by the Arabs to Archimedes, the work probably is
substantially authentic. There is also doubt about the authenticity of
the “cattle-problem,” which is a challenge to mathematicians to solve a
set of indeterminate simultaneous equations in eight unknown quantities.
The problem incidentally provides a first example of what later was to
be known as a “Pell equation.”</p>
<p>Semiregular Solids and Trigonometry</p>
<p>That quite a number of Archimedean works have been lost is clear from
many references. We learn (from Pappus) that Archimedes discovered all
of the thirteen possible so-called semiregular solids, or convex
polyhedrons whose faces are regular polygons but not all of the same
type. Arabic scholars inform us that the familiar area formula for a
triangle in terms of its three sides, usually known as Heron’s formula—,
where s is the semiperimeter—was known to Archimedes several centuries
before Heron lived. Arabic scholars also attribute to Archimedes the
“theorem on the broken chord”—if AB and BC make up any broken chord in a
circle (with AB ≠ BC) and if M is the midpoint of the arc ABC and F the
foot of the perpendicular from M to the longer chord, F will be the
midpoint of the broken chord ABC (Fig. 6.9). Al-Biruni gave several
proofs of the theorem, one of which is carried out by drawing in the
dotted lines in the figure, making FC′ = FC and proving that ΔMBC′ ≅
ΔMBA. Hence, BC′ = BA, and it therefore follows that C′F = AB + BF = FC.
We do not know whether Archimedes saw any trigonometric significance in
the theorem, but it has been suggested that it served for him as a
formula analogous to our sin (x−y) = sinx cosy−cosx siny. To show the
equivalence, we let . Then, . Now, the chords corresponding to these
three arcs are, respectively, MC = 2sinx, BM = 2siny, and AB = 2sin
(x−y). Moreover, the projections of MC and MB on BC are FC = 2sinx cosy
and FB = 2siny cosx. If, finally, we write the broken-chord theorem in
the form AB = FC−FB, and if for these three chords we substitute their
trigonometric equivalents, the formula for sin (x−y) results. Other
trigonometric identities can, of course, be derived from the same
broken-chord theorem, indicating that Archimedes may have found it a
useful tool in his astronomical calculations.</p>

<p>The Method</p>
<p>Unlike the Elements of Euclid, which have survived in many Greek and
Arabic manuscripts, the treatises of Archimedes have reached us through
a slender thread. Almost all copies are from a single Greek original
that was in existence in the early sixteenth century and itself was
copied from an original of about the ninth or tenth century. The
Elements of Euclid has been familiar to mathematicians virtually without
interruption since its composition, but Archimedean treatises have had a
more checkered career. There have been times when few or even none of
Archimedes’ works were known. In the days of Eutocius, a first-rate
scholar and skillful commentator of the sixth century, only three of the
many Archimedean works were generally known—On the Equilibrium of
Planes, the incomplete Measurement of a Circle, and the admirable On the
Sphere and Cylinder. Under the circumstances, it is a wonder that such a
large proportion of what Archimedes wrote has survived to this day.
Among the amazing aspects of the provenance of Archimedean works is the
discovery within the twentieth century of one of the most important
treatises—one that Archimedes simply called The Method and that had been
lost since the early centuries of our era until its rediscovery in
1906.</p>
<p>The Method of Archimedes is of particular significance because it
discloses for us a facet of Archimedes’ thought that is not found
elsewhere. His other treatises are gems of logical precision, with
little hint of the preliminary analysis that may have led to the
definitive formulations. So thoroughly without motivation did his proofs
appear to some writers of the seventeenth century that they suspected
Archimedes of having concealed his method of approach in order that his
work might be admired more. How unwarranted such an ungenerous estimate
of the great Syracusan was became clear in 1906 with the discovery of
the manuscript containing The Method. Here Archimedes had published a
description of the preliminary “mechanical” investigations that had led
to many of his chief mathematical discoveries. He thought that his
“method” in these cases lacked rigor, because it assumed an area, for
example, to be a sum of line segments.</p>
<p>The Method, as we have it, contains most of the text of some fifteen
propositions sent in the form of a letter to Eratosthenes, a
mathematician and the chief of the Alexandrian Library. The author
opened by saying that it is easier to supply a proof of a theorem if we
first have some knowledge of what is involved; as an example, he cites
the proofs of Eudoxus on the cone and the pyramid, which had been
facilitated by the preliminary assertions, without proof, made by
Democritus. Then, Archimedes announced that he himself had a
“mechanical” approach that paved the way for some of his proofs. The
very first theorem that he discovered by this approach was the one on
the area of a parabolic segment; in Proposition 1 of The Method, the
author describes how he arrived at this theorem by balancing lines as
one balances weights in mechanics. He thought of the areas of the
parabolic segment ABC and the triangle AFC (where FC is tangent to the
parabola at C) as the totality of a set of lines parallel to the
diameter QB of the parabola, such as OP (Fig. 6.10) for the parabola and
OM for the triangle. If one were to place at H (where HK = KC) a line
segment equal to OP, this would just balance the line OM where it now
is, K being the fulcrum. (This can be shown through the law of the lever
and the property of the parabola.) Hence, the area of the parabola, if
placed with its center of gravity at H, will just balance the triangle,
whose center of gravity is along KC and a third of the way from K to C.
From this, one easily sees that the area of the parabolic segment is
one-third the area of triangle AFC, or four-thirds the area of the
inscribed triangle ABC.</p>
<p>FIG. 6.10</p>
<p>Archimedes’ favorite theorem, the one represented on his tomb, was
also suggested to him by his mechanical method. It is described in
Proposition 2 of The Method:</p>
<p>Any segment of a sphere has to the cone with the same base and height
the ratio which the sum of the radius of the sphere and the height of
the complementary segment has to the height of the complementary
segment.</p>
<p>The theorem readily follows from a beautiful balancing property that
Archimedes discovered (and that can be easily verified in terms of
modern formulas). Let AQDCP be a cross-section of a sphere with center 0
and diameter AC (Fig. 6.11) and let AUV be a plane section of a right
circular cone with axis AC and UV as diameter of the base. Let IJUV be a
right circular cylinder with axis AC and with UV = IJ as diameter and
let AH = AC. If a plane is passed through any point S on the axis AC and
perpendicular to AC, the plane will cut the cone, the sphere, and the
cylinder in circles of radii r1 = SR, r2 = SP, and r3 = SN,
respectively. If we call the areas of these circles A1, A2, and A3,
then, Archimedes found, A1 and A2, when placed with their centers at H,
will just balance A3 where it now is, with A as the fulcrum. Hence, if
we call the volumes of the sphere, the cone, and the cylinder V1, V2,
and V3, it follows that , and because the sphere must be Because the
volume V3 of the cylinder is known (from Democritus and Eudoxus), the
volume of the sphere is also known—in modern notation, . By applying the
same balancing technique to the spherical segment with base diameter BD,
to the cone with base diameter EF, and to the cylinder with base
diameter KL, the volume of the spherical segment is found in the same
manner as for the whole sphere.</p>
<p>FIG. 6.11</p>
<p>The method of equilibrium of circular sections about a vertex as
fulcrum was applied by Archimedes to discover the volumes of the
segments of three solids of revolution—the ellipsoid, the paraboloid,
and the hyperboloid, as well as the centers of gravity of the paraboloid
(conoid), of any hemisphere, and of a semicircle. The Method closes with
the determination of volumes of two solids that are favorites in modern
calculus books—a wedge cut from a right circular cylinder by two planes
(as in Fig. 6.12) and the volume common to two equal right circular
cylinders intersecting at right angles.</p>
<p>FIG. 6.12</p>
<p>The work that contained such marvelous results of more than 2,000
years ago was recovered almost by accident in 1906. The indefatigable
Danish scholar J. L. Heiberg had read that at Constantinople, there was
a palimpsest of mathematical content. (A palimpsest is a parchment the
original writing on which has been only imperfectly washed off and
replaced with a new and different text.) Close inspection showed him
that the original manuscript had contained something by Archimedes, and
through photographs, he was able to read most of the Archimedean text.
The manuscript consisted of 185 leaves, mostly of parchment but a few of
paper, with the Archimedean text copied in a tenth-century hand. An
attempt—fortunately, none too successful—had been made to expunge this
text in order to use the parchment for a Euchologion (a collection of
prayers and liturgies used in the Eastern Orthodox Church) written in
about the thirteenth century. The mathematical text contained On the
Sphere and Cylinder, most of the work On Spirals, part of Measurement of
the Circle and On the Equilibrium of Planes, and On Floating Bodies, all
of which have been preserved in other manuscripts; most important of
all, the palimpsest gives us the only surviving copy of The Method.</p>
<p>The palimpsest, lost after World War I, once again came to public
notice in the 1990s when it was put up for sale at auction. In 1999, the
anonymous purchaser deposited it at the Walters Art Gallery in
Baltimore, Maryland, and proceeded to fund intensive study of the
palimpsest by a group of specialists brought from the areas of
conservation, classical and medieval studies, and imaging techniques.
They have been able to capture most of the partially destroyed
Archimedean text, a task made difficult not only by the
thirteenth-century reuse of the parchment but by an additional
twentieth-century forgery that superimposed religious images over the
text. Twentieth-century technology that was used to assist in the
revelation of the original text included spectral imaging devices from
the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Johns Hopkins University,
among others, and even a synchrotron from the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center.</p>
<p>In a sense, the palimpsest is symbolic of the contributions of the
Middle Ages, as well as the Modern Age of Technology. Intense
preoccupation with religious concerns very nearly wiped out one of the
most important works of the greatest mathematician of antiquity, yet in
the end, it was medieval scholarship that inadvertently preserved this
and much besides, which might otherwise have been lost. Similarly,
modern technology, despite its potential for material destruction, has
enabled us to glimpse in detail what it is that was preserved.</p>
