<h4 id="byzantine-mathematicians">Byzantine Mathematicians</h4>
<p>There were contemporaries of Simplicius and Metrodorus who had
training that was adequate for an understanding of the works of
Archimedes and Apollonius. Among these was Eutocius (born ca. 480 CE),
who commented on several Archimedean treatises and on the Apollonian
Conics. We owe to Eutocius the Archimedean solution of a cubic through
intersecting conics, referred to in The Sphere and Cylinder but not
otherwise extant except through the commentary of Eutocius. The
commentary by Eutocius on the Conics of Apollonius was dedicated to
Anthemius of Tralles (fl. ca. 534 CE), an able mathematician and
architect of St. Sophia of Constantinople, who described the string
construction of the ellipse and wrote a work, On Burning-Mirrors, in
which the focal properties of the parabola are described. His colleague
and successor in the building of St. Sophia, Isidore of Miletus (fl. 520
CE), was also a mathematician of some ability. It was Isidore who made
known the commentaries of Eutocius and spurred a revival of interest in
the works of Archimedes and Apollonius. To him perhaps we owe the
familiar T-square and string construction of the parabola—and possibly
also the apocryphal Book XV of Euclid’s Elements. It may be in large
measure due to the activities of the Constantinople group—Eutocius,
Isidore, and Anthemius—that Greek versions of Archimedean works and of
the first four books of Apollonius’s Conics have survived to this
day.</p>
<p>When in 527 CE Justinian became emperor in the East, he evidently
felt that the pagan learning of the philosophical schools in Athens was
a threat to orthodox Christianity; hence, in 529 CE the philosophical
schools were closed and the scholars dispersed. About this time,
Simplicius and some of the other philosophers looked to the East for a
haven, which they found in Persia, where under Sassanid rule they
established what has been called the “Athenian Academy in Exile.” The
date 529 CE is therefore often taken to mark the close of European
mathematical development in antiquity. Henceforth, the seeds of Greek
science were to develop in Near and Far Eastern countries until, some
600 years later, the Latin world was in a more receptive mood. The date
529 CE has another significance that may be taken as symptomatic of a
change in values—in this year, the venerable monastery of Monte Cassino
was established.</p>
<p>Greek mathematics did not, of course, entirely disappear from Europe
in 529 CE, for commentaries continued to be written in Greek in the
Byzantine Empire, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and copied.
During the days of Proclus, the Academy at Athens had become a center of
Neoplatonic learning. Neoplatonic thought exerted a strong influence in
the Eastern Empire, which accounts for commentaries on Nicomachus’s
Introduction to Arithmetic by John Philoponus in the sixth century and
by Michael Constantine Psellus in the eleventh. Psellus also wrote a
Greek summary of the mathematical quadrivium, as did Georgios Pachymeres
(1242 1316) two centuries later. Both Pachymeres and his contemporary
Maximos Planudes wrote commentaries on the Arithmetic of Diophantus.
These examples show that a thin thread of the old Greek tradition
continued in the Eastern Empire to the very end of the medieval period.
The spirit of mathematics languished, however, where men argued less
about the value of geometry and more about the way to salvation. For the
next steps in mathematical development, we must therefore turn our backs
on Europe and look toward the East.</p>
