<h4 id="equations">Equations</h4>
<p>One table for which the Babylonians found considerable use is a
tabulation of the values of n3 1n2 for integral values of n, a table
essential in Babylonian algebra; this subject reached a considerably
higher level in Mesopotamia than in Egypt. Many problem texts from the
Old Babylonian period show that the solution of the complete three-term
quadratic equation afforded the Babylonians no serious difficulty, for
flexible algebraic operations had been developed. They could transpose
terms in an equation by adding equals to equals, and they could multiply
both sides by like quantities to remove fractions or to eliminate
factors. By adding 4ab to (a 2b)2 they could obtain (a 1b)2, for they
were familiar with many simple forms of factoring. They did not use
letters for unknown quantities, for the alphabet had not yet been
invented, but words such as “length,” “breadth,” “area,” and “volume”
served effectively in this capacity. That these words may well have been
used in a very abstract sense is suggested by the fact that the
Babylonians had no qualms about adding a “length” to an “area” or an
“area” to a “volume.”</p>
<p>Egyptian algebra had been much concerned with linear equations, but
the Babylonians evidently found these too elementary for much attention.
In one problem, the weight x of a stone is called for if ðx1x / 7Þ1ðx1x
/ 7Þ is one mina; the answer is simply given as 48;7,30 gin, where 60
gin make a mina. In another problem in an Old Babylonian text, we find
two simultaneous linear equations in two unknown quantities, called
respectively the “first silver ring” and the “second silver ring.” If we
call these x and y in our notation, the equations are x/71y/1151 and
6x/75l0y/11. The answer is expressed laconically in terms of the
rule</p>
<p>x 11 1 y 7 1</p>
<p>5 1 and 5 2 :</p>
<p>7 7111 72 11 7111 72</p>
<p>In another pair of equations, part of the method of solution is
included in the text. Here width1length57 hands, and length1width510
hands. The solution is first found by replacing each “hand” with 5
“fingers” and then noticing that a width of 20 fingers and a length of
30 fingers will satisfy both equations. Following this, however, the
solution is found by an alternative method equivalent to an elimination
through combination.</p>
<p>Equat ions</p>
<p>Expressing all dimensions in terms of hands, and letting the length
and the width be x and y, respectively, the equations become y14x528 and
x1y510. Subtracting the second equation from the first, one has the
result 3x518; hence, x56 hands, or 30 fingers, and y520 fingers.</p>
<p>Quadratic Equations</p>
<p>The solution of a three-term quadratic equation seems to have
exceeded by far the algebraic capabilities of the Egyptians, but Otto
Neugebauer in 1930 disclosed that such equations had been handled
effectively by the Babylonians in some of the oldest problem texts. For
instance, one problem calls for the side of a square if the area less
the side is 14,30. The solution of this problem, equivalent to solving
x2 2x5870, is expressed as follows:</p>
<p>Take half of 1, which is 0;30, and multiply 0;30 by 0;30, which is
0;15; add this to 14,30 to get l4,30;15. This is the square of 29;30.
Now add 0;30 to 29;30, and the result is 30, the side of the square.</p>
<p>The Babylonian solution is, of course, exactly equivalent to the
forwhich is the quadratic formula that is familiar to high school
students ofpð Þ2 2 2 mula x5 p=2 1q1p=2 for a root of the equation x
2px5q,</p>
<p>today. In another text, the equation 1x 17x56;15 was reduced by the
Babylonians to the standard type x2 1px5q by first multiplying through
by 11 to obtain (11x)2 17(11x)51,8;45. This is a quadratic in normal
form in the unknown quantity y511x, and the solution for y is easily
value of x is then determined. This solution is remarkable as an
instancepð Þ2 obtained by the familiar rule y5 p=2 1q2p=2, from which
the</p>
<p>of the use of algebraic transformations.</p>
<p>Until modern times, there was no thought of solving a quadratic
equation of the form x2 1px1q50, where p and q are positive, for the
equation has no positive root. Consequently, quadratic equations in
ancient and medieval times—and even in the early modern period— were
classified under three types:</p>
<p>1.x2 1px5q</p>
<p>2.x2 5px1q 3. x2 1q5px</p>
<p>All three types are found in Old Babylonian texts of some 4,000 years
ago. The first two types are illustrated by the problems given
previously; the third type appears frequently in problem texts, where it
is treated as equivalent to the simultaneous system x1y5p, xy5q. So
numerous are problems in which one is asked to find two numbers when
given their product and either their sum or their difference that these
seem to have constituted for the ancients, both Babylonian and Greek, a
sort of “normal form” to which quadratics were reduced. Then, by
transforming the simultaneous equations xy5a and x 6 y5b into the pair
of linear equations x6y5b and x7y5pb2 74a; the values of x and y are
found through an addition and a subtraction. A Yale cuneiform tablet,
for example, asks for the solution of the system x1y56;30 and xy57;30.
The instructions of the scribe are essentially as follows. First
find</p>
<p>x1y</p>
<p>53;15 2</p>
<p>and then find x1y 2</p>
<p>510;33;45:</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>and x1y 2</p>
<p>2xy53;3;45</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>x1y 2</p>
<p>2xy51;45:</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Hence,</p>
<p>x1y x2y</p>
<p>1 53;1511;45</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>x1y x2y</p>
<p>2 53;1521;45:</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>From the last two equations, it is obvious that x55 and y51. Because
the quantities x and y enter symmetrically in the given conditional
equations, it is possible to interpret the values of x and y as the two
roots of the quadratic equation x2 17;3056;30x. Another Babylonian text
calls for a number that when added to its reciprocal becomes
2;0,0,33,20. This leads to a quadratic of type 3, and again we have two
solutions, 1;0,45 and 0;59,15,33,20.</p>
<p>Cubic Equations</p>
<p>The Babylonian reduction of a quadratic equation of the form ax2
1bx5c to the normal form y2 1by5ac through the substitution y5ax shows
the extraordinary degree of flexibility in Mesopotamian algebra. There
is no record in Egypt of the solution of a cubic equation, but among the
Babylonians there are many instances of this.</p>
<p>Me a sur e ment s: P y t ha gor e an Tr ia d s</p>
<p>Pure cubics, such as x3 50;7,30, were solved by direct reference to
tables of cubes and cube roots, where the solution x50;30 was read off.
Linear interpolation within the tables was used to find approximations
for values not listed in the tables. Mixed cubics in the standard form
x3 1x2 5a were solved similarly by reference to the available tables,
which listed values of the combination n3 1n2 for integral values of n
from 1 to 30. With the help of these tables, they easily read off that
the solution, for example, of x3 1x2 54,12 is equal to 6. For still more
general cases of equations of the third degree, such as 144x3 112x2 521,
the Babylonians used their method of substitution. Multiplying both
sides by 12 and using y512x, the equation becomes y3 1y2
54,12,fromwhichyisfoundtobeequalto6,hencexisjustor0;30. Cubics of the
form ax3 1bx2 5c are reducible to the Babylonian normal form by
multiplying through by a2 /b3 to obtain (ax/b)3 1(ax/b)2 5 ca2 /b3, a
cubic of standard type in the unknown quantity ax/b. Reading off from
the tables the value of this unknown quantity, the value of x is
determined. Whether the Babylonians were able to reduce the general
fourterm cubic, ax3 1bx2 1ex5d, to their normal form is not known. It is
not too unlikely that they could reduce it, as is indicated by the fact
that a solution of a quadratic suffices to carry the four-term equation
to the three-term form px3 1qx2 5r, from which, as we have seen, the
normal form is readily obtained. There is, however, no evidence now
available to suggest that the Mesopotamian mathematicians actually
carried out such a reduction of the general cubic equation.</p>
<p>With modern symbolism, it is a simple matter to see that (ax)3 1(ax)2
5b is essentially the same type of equation as y3 1y2 5b, but to
recognize this without our notation is an achievement of far greater
significance for the development of mathematics than even the vaunted
positional principle in arithmetic that we owe to the same civilization.
Babylonian algebra had reached such an extraordinary level of
abstraction that the equations ax4 1bx2 5c and ax8 1bx4 5c were
recognized as nothing worse than quadratic equations in disguise—that
is, quadratics in x2 and x4.</p>
<p>Measurements: Pythagorean Triads</p>
<p>The algebraic achievements of the Babylonians are admirable, but the
motives behind this work are not easy to understand. It has commonly
been supposed that virtually all pre-Hellenic science and mathematics
were purely utilitarian, but what sort of real-life situation in ancient
Babylon could possibly lead to problems involving the sum of a number
and its reciprocal or a difference between an area and a length? If
utility was the motive, then the cult of immediacy was less strong than
it is now, for direct connections between purpose and practice in
Babylonian mathematics are far from apparent. That there may well have
been toleration for, if not

the Plimpton Collection at Columbia University. The tablet dates from
the Old Babylonian period (ca. 1900 1600 BCE), and the tabulations it
contains could easily be interpreted as a record of business accounts.
Analysis,however,showsthatithasdeepmathematicalsignificanceinthetheory
of numbers and that it was perhaps related to a kind of
proto-trigonometry. Plimpton 322 was part of a larger tablet, as is
illustrated by the break along the left-hand edge, and the remaining
portion contains four columns of
numbersarrangedinfifteenhorizontalrows.Theright-handcolumncontains the
digits from 1 to 15, and, evidently, its purpose was simply to identify
in order the items in the other three columns, arranged as follows:</p>
<p>1,59,0,15 1,59 2,49 1</p>
<p>1,56,56,58,14,50,6,15 56,7 1,20,25 2</p>

<p>1,29,21,54,2,15 27,59 48,49 12</p>
<p>1,27,0,3,45 2,41 4,49 13</p>
<p>1,25,48,51,35,6,40 29,31 53,49 14</p>
<p>1,23,13,46,40 56 1,46 15</p>
<p>The tablet is not in such excellent condition that all of the numbers
can still be read, but the clearly discernible pattern of construction
in the table made it possible to determine from the context the few
items that were missing because of small fractures. To understand what
the entries in the table probably meant to the Babylonians, consider the
right triangle ABC (Fig. 3.1). If the numbers in the second and third
columns (from left to right) are thought of as the sides a and c,
respectively, of the right triangle, then the first, or left-hand,
column contains in each case the square of the ratio of c to b. The
left-hand column, therefore, is a short table of values of sec2 A, but
we must not assume that the Babylonians were familiar with our secant
concept. Neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians introduced a measure
of angles in the modern sense. Nevertheless, the rows of numbers in
Plimpton 322 are not arranged in haphazard fashion, as a superficial
glance might imply. If the first comma in column one (on the left) is
replaced by a semicolon, it is obvious that the numbers in this column
decrease steadily from top to bottom. Moreover, the first number is
quite close to sec2 45, and the last number in the column is
approximately sec2 31, with the intervening numbers close to</p>
<p>Me a sur e ment s: P y t ha gor e an Tr ia d s</p>
<p>the values of sec2 A as A decreases by degrees from 45 to 31. This
arrangement obviously is not the result of chance alone. Not only was
the arrangement carefully thought out, but the dimensions of the
triangle were also derived according to a rule. Those who constructed
the table evidently began with two regular sexagesimal integers, which
we shall call p and q, with p.q, and then formed the triple of numbers
p2 2q2 and 2pq and p2 1q2. The three integers thus obtained are easily
seen to form a Pythagorean triple, in which the square of the largest is
equal to the sum of the squares of the other two. Hence, these numbers
can be used as the dimensions of the right triangle ABC, with a5p2 2q2
and b52pq and c5p2 1q2. Restricting themselves to values of p less than
60 and to corresponding values of q such that 1, p=q,11p2, that is, to
right triangles for which a,b, the Babylonians presumably found that
there were just 38 possible pairs of values of p and q satisfying the
conditions, and for these they apparently formed the 38 corresponding
Pythagorean triples. Only the first 15, arranged in descending order for
the ratio (p2 1q2)/2pq, are included in the table on the tablet, but it
is likely that the scribe had intended to continue the table on the
other side of the tablet. It has also been suggested that the portion of
Plimpton 322 that has broken off from the left side contained four
additional columns, in which were tabulated the values of p and q and
2pq and what we should now call tan2 A.</p>
<p>The Plimpton Tablet 322 might give the impression that it is an
exercise in the theory of numbers, but it is likely that this aspect of
the subject was merely ancillary to the problem of measuring the areas
of squares on the sides of a right triangle. The Babylonians disliked
working with the reciprocals of irregular numbers, for these could not
be expressed exactly in finite sexagesimal fractions. Hence, they were
interested in values of p and q that should give them regular integers
for the sides of right triangles of varying shapes, from the isosceles
right</p>
<p>triangle down to one with a small value for the ratio a/b. For
example, the numbers in the first row are found by starting with p512
and q55, with the corresponding values a5119 and b5120 and c5169. The
values of a and c are precisely those in the second and third positions
from the left in the first row on the Plimpton tablet; the ratio c2 /b2
528561/14400 is the number 1;59,0,15 that appears in the first position
in this row. The same relationship is found in the other fourteen rows;
the Babylonians carried out the work so accurately that the ratio c2/b2
in the tenth row is expressed as a fraction with eight sexagesimal
places, equivalent to about fourteen decimal places in our notation.</p>
<p>So much of Babylonian mathematics is bound up with tables of
reciprocals that it is not surprising to find that the items in Plimpton
322 are related to reciprocal relationships. If a51, then 15(c1b)(c2b),
so that c1b and c2b are reciprocals. If one starts with c1b5n, where n
is any regular sexagesimal, then c2b5l/n; hence, a51 and b5ðn21=nÞ and
c5ðn11=nÞ are a Pythagorean fraction triple, which can easily be
converted to a Pythagorean integer triple by multiplying each of the
three by 2n. All triples in the Plimpton tablet are easily calculated by
this device.</p>
<p>The account of Babylonian algebra that we have given is
representative of their work, but it is not intended to be exhaustive.
There are in the Babylonian tablets many other things, although none so
striking as those</p>
<p>Pol y gonal Ar e a s</p>
<p>in the Plimpton Tablet 322; as in this case, many are still open to
multiple interpretations. For instance, in one tablet the geometric
progression 112122 1?129 is summed, and in another the sum of the series
of squares 12 122 132 1?1102 is found. One wonders whether the
Babylonians knew the general formulas for the sum of a geometric
progression and the sum of the first n perfect squares. It is quite
possible that they did, and it has been conjectured that they were aware
that the sum of the first n perfect cubes is equal to the square of the
sum of the first n integers. Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that
tablets from Mesopotamia resemble Egyptian papyri in that only specific
cases are given, with no general formulations.</p>
