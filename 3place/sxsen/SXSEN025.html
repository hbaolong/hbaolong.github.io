<h4 id="chapter-21-algebra">Chapter 21 Algebra</h4>
<p>It is no paradox to say that in our most theoretical moods we may be
nearest to our most practical applications.</p>
<p>—A. N. Whitehead</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The development of algebraic concepts in England in the first half of
the nineteenth century differed fundamentally from that on the
Continent. Abel, Galois, and other Continental mathematicians evolved
new concepts while working on unsolved problems and adapting—through
fusion, generalization, or straight transfer—existing successful
methods. As we have seen, this allowed their work to be recognized for
its immediate results, even if the full significance of a new concept
contained therein went undetected. The British contributors to algebra
who belonged to the generation of Abel and Galois, on the other hand,
set out to establish algebra as a “demonstrative science.” These men
were strongly affected by the fact that England’s analytic contributions
lagged behind those of the Continent. This was attributed to the
superiority of “symbolic reasoning,” or, more specifically, of the
Leibnizian dy/dx notation over the fluxional dots still prevalent in
England. Since the seventeenth century, however, mathematicians had been
noting that neither higher analysis nor algebra had attained the degree
of rigor found in geometry.</p>
<p>British Algebra and the Operational Calculus of Functions</p>
<p>It was George Peacock who produced the first major work “written with
a view of conferring upon Algebra the character of a demonstrative
science.” To accomplish this goal, Peacock proposed a reevaluation of
the relationship between arithmetic and algebra. Rather than being
viewed as the foundation of algebra, arithmetic “can only be considered
as a Science of Suggestion, to which the principles and operations of
Algebra are adapted, but by which they are neither limited nor
determined.” Peacock therefore separated “arithmetical” from
“symbolical” algebra. The elements of arithmetical algebra are numbers,
and its operations are those of arithmetic. Symbolical algebra, however,
is “a science, which regards the combinations of signs and symbols only
according to determinate laws, which are altogether independent of the
specific values of the symbols themselves.” Peacock related the two by a
principle reminiscent of François-Joseph Servois’s (1768–1847) principle
of the preservation of formal laws; it is the “principle of the
permanence of equivalent forms”:</p>
<p>Whatever form is algebraically equivalent to another when expressed
in general symbols, must continue to be equivalent whatever these
symbols denote.</p>
<p>Conversely,</p>
<p>Whatever equivalent form is discoverable in arithmetical algebra
considered as the science of suggestion when the symbols are general in
their form, though specific in their value, will continue to be an
equivalent form when the symbols are general in their nature as well as
in their form.</p>
<p>The justification for such a bold extrapolation is not made clear.
Peacock merely accepts this as a “principle of the permanence of
equivalent forms” somewhat akin to the correlation principle that Carnot
and Poncelet had used so fruitfully in geometry. Yet in one respect, the
algebraic form of this fuzzy postulate served as a deterrent to
progress, for it suggested that the laws of algebra are the same no
matter what the numbers or the objects within the algebra may be.
Peacock, it appears, was thinking primarily of the number system of
integers and the real magnitudes of geometry, and his distinction
between the two types of algebra was not so different from that which
Viète had made between logistica numerosa and logistica speciosa.</p>
<p>Peacock restated his views on algebra in a report on analysis
presented to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in
1833, whereby they became widely known. Within a few years, several
authors treated the subject anew, to varying degrees linking the
foundations of algebra to the operational calculus of functions, which
was also treated with renewed interest. Robert Murphy (1806–1843) did so
in a paper read to the Royal Society in December 1836; Augustus De
Morgan (1806–1871) did so in a Treatise on the Calculus of Functions
published the same year; and D. F. Gregory (1813–1844) did so in a
series of memoirs on the nature of algebra published in the Transactions
of the Edinburgh Royal Society a few years later. Gregory remarked on
the identity of the laws of combination for the symbols of
differentiation and differences and those of number and placed his and
Peacock’s studies in line of succession to those of Leibniz, Lagrange,
John F. W. Herschel, and Servois on the calculus. Gregory’s friend
George Boole, in a prize-winning essay presented to the Royal Society in
1844, stressed that</p>
<p>any great advances in the higher analysis must be sought for by an
increased attention to the laws of combinations of symbols. The value of
this principle can scarcely be overrated.</p>
<p>Three years later, Boole illustrated his position by applying the
laws of combination of symbols to logic.</p>
<p>Boole and the Algebra of Logic</p>
<p>Born into an impecunious lower-class tradesman’s family in Lincoln,
England, George Boole (1815–1864) had only a common school education,
but he learned both Greek and Latin independently, believing that this
knowledge would help him rise above his station. Having become friendly
with De Morgan, he also took a keen interest in a controversy over logic
that the Scottish philosopher Sir William Hamilton (1788–1856), not to
be confused with the Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton
(1805–1865), had raised with De Morgan. The result was that in 1847,
Boole published a short work titled The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,
a little book that De Morgan recognized as epoch making.</p>
<p>The history of logic may be divided, with some slight degree of
oversimplification, into three stages: (1) Greek logic, (2) Scholastic
logic, and (3) mathematical logic. In the first stage, logical formulas
consisted of words of ordinary language, subject to the usual
syntactical rules. In the second stage, logic was abstracted from
ordinary language but characterized by differentiated syntactical rules
and specialized semantic functions. In the third stage, logic became
marked by the use of an artificial language in which words and signs
have narrowly limited semantic functions. Whereas in the first two
stages, logical theorems were derived from ordinary language, the logic
of the third stage proceeds in a contrary manner—it first constructs a
purely formal system, and only later does it look for an interpretation
in everyday speech. Although Leibniz is sometimes regarded as a
precursor of the latter point of view, its floruit date is really the
year in which Boole’s first book appeared, as well as De Morgan’s Formal
Logic. The work of Boole, in particular, emphasized that logic should be
associated with mathematics, rather than with metaphysics, as the
Scottish Sir William Hamilton had argued.</p>
<p>More important even than his mathematical logic was Boole’s view of
mathematics itself. In the introduction to his Mathematical Analysis of
Logic, the author objected to the then current view of mathematics as
the science of magnitude or number (a definition still adopted in some
of the weaker dictionaries). Espousing a far more general view, Boole
wrote,</p>
<p>We might justly assign it as the definitive character of a true
Calculus, that it is a method resting upon the employment of Symbols,
whose laws of combination are known and general, and whose results admit
of a consistent interpretation. . . . It is upon the foundation of this
general principle, that I propose to establish the Calculus of Logic,
and that I claim for it a place among the acknowledged forms of
Mathematical Analysis,</p>
<p>Peacock’s Algebra of 1830 had suggested that the symbols of objects
in algebra need not stand for numbers, and De Morgan argued that
interpretations of the symbols for operations were also arbitrary; Boole
carried the formalism to its conclusion. No longer was mathematics to be
limited to questions of number and continuous magnitude. Here, for the
first time, the view is clearly expressed that the essential
characteristic of mathematics is not so much its content as its form. If
any topic is presented in such a way that it consists of symbols and
precise rules of operation on these symbols, subject only to the
requirement of inner consistency, this topic is part of mathematics.
Although the Mathematical Analysis of Logic did not achieve wide
recognition, it probably was on the weight of this work that two years
later, Boole was appointed professor of mathematics at the newly
established Queens College in Cork.</p>
<p>Boole’s Investigation of the Laws of Thought of 1854 is a classic in
the history of mathematics, for it amplified and clarified the ideas
presented in 1847, establishing both formal logic and a new algebra,
known as Boolean algebra, the algebra of sets, or the algebra of logic.
Boole used the letters x, y, z, . . . to represent objects of a subset
of things—numbers, points, ideas, or other entities—selected from a
universal set or universe of discourse, the totality of which he
designated by the symbol or “number” 1. For example, if the symbol 1
represents all Europeans, x might stand for all Europeans who are French
citizens, y might be all European men over twenty-one, and z might be
all Europeans who are between five and six feet tall. The symbol or
number 0 Boole took to indicate the empty set, containing no element of
the universal set, what now is known as the null set. The sign + between
two letters or symbols, as x + y, he took to be the union of the subsets
x and y—that is, the set made up of all of the elements in x or y (or
both). The multiplication sign × represented the intersection of sets,
so that x × y means the elements or the objects that are in the subset x
and also in the subset y. In the previous example, x + y consists of all
Europeans who are French citizens or are men over twenty-one or both; x
× y (also written as x · y or simply as xy) is the set of French
citizens who are men over twenty-one. (Boole, unlike De Morgan, used
exclusive union, not permitting common elements in x and y, but modern
Boolean algebra more conveniently takes + to be the inclusive union of
sets that may have elements in common.) The sign = represents the
relationship of identity. It is clear that the five fundamental laws of
algebra now hold for this Boolean algebra, for x + y = y + x, xy = yx, x
+ (y + z) = (x + y) + z, x(yz) = (xy)z, and x(y + z) = xy + xz.
Nevertheless, not all of the rules of ordinary algebra continue to be
valid: for example, 1 + 1 = 1 and x · x = x. (The second of these
appears in the work of Boole, but not the first, because he used
exclusive union). The equation x2 = x has only the two roots, in
ordinary algebra, x = 0 and x = 1; in this respect, the algebra of logic
and ordinary algebra are in agreement. The equation x2 = x, when written
in the form x(l − x) = 0, also suggests that 1 − x should designate the
complement of the subset x, that is, all of the elements in the
universal set that are not in the subset x. Although it is true in
Boolean algebra that x3 = x or x(l − x2) = 0 or x(1 − x)(l + x) = 0, the
solution in ordinary algebra differs from that in Boolean algebra, in
which there are no negative numbers. Boolean algebra also differs from
ordinary algebra in that if zx = zy (where z is not the null set), it
does not follow that x = y; nor is it necessarily true that if xy = 0,
then x or y must be 0.</p>
<p>Boole showed that his algebra provided an easy algorithm for
syllogistic reasoning. The equation xy = x, for example, says very
neatly that all x’s are y’s. If it is also given that all y’s are z’s,
then yz = y. On substituting in the first equation the value of y given
by the second equation, the result is x(yz) = x. Using the associative
law for multiplication, the last equation can be written as (xy)z = x,
and, on replacing xy with x, we have xz = x, which is simply the
symbolic way of saying that all x’s are z’s.</p>
<p>The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847) and, a fortiori,
Investigation of the Laws of Thought (1854) contain much more of the
algebra of sets than we have indicated. In particular, the latter work
includes applications to probability. Notations have changed somewhat
since Boole’s day, so that union and intersection are generally
indicated by ∪ and ∩, rather than by + and ×, and the symbol for the
null set is ϕ, rather than 0, but the fundamental principles of Boolean
algebra are those that were laid down by Boole more than a century
ago.</p>
<p>There is an aspect of Boole’s work that is not closely related to his
treatises in logic or the theory of sets but that is familiar to every
student of differential equations. This is the algorithm of differential
operators, which he introduced to facilitate the treatment of linear
differential equations. If, for example, we wish to solve the
differential equation ay″ + by′ + cy = 0, the equation is written in the
notation (aD2 + bD + c)y = 0. Then, regarding D as an unknown quantity,
rather than as an operator, we solve the algebraic quadratic equation
aD2 + bD + c = 0. If the roots of the algebraic equation are p and q,
then epx and eqx are solutions of the differential equation, and Aepx +
Beqx is a general solution of the differential equation. There are many
other situations in which Boole, in his Treatise on Differential
Equations of 1859, pointed out parallels between the properties of the
differential operator (and its inverse) and the rules of algebra.
British mathematicians in the second half of the nineteenth century were
thus again becoming leaders in algorithmic analysis, a field in which,
fifty years earlier, they had been badly deficient.</p>
<p>Boole died in 1864, only ten years after publishing his Investigation
of the Laws of Thought, but recognition, including an honorary degree
from the University of Dublin, had come to him before his death. It is
curious to note that Georg Cantor, who like Boole was one of the chief
trailblazers of the century, was one of the few who declined to accept
the work of Boole. On the other hand, Boole’s work prompted a sequence
of axiomatic studies by W. S. Jevons (1835–1882), C. S. Peirce
(1839–1914), E. Schröder (1841–1902), and others, which led to a
complete set of postulates for the algebra of logic after 1900.</p>
<p>Augustus De Morgan</p>
<p>Among the supporters of the new view of algebra was Augustus De
Morgan, a prolific writer who had helped found the British Association
for the Advancement of Science (1831). De Morgan had been born, blind in
one eye, in India, his father having been associated with the East India
Company; he attended Trinity College, graduating as fourth wrangler. He
could not hold a fellowship at Cambridge or Oxford because he refused to
submit to the necessary religious test, despite the fact that he had
been brought up in the Church of England, in which his mother hoped he
would become a minister. De Morgan consequently was appointed, at the
early age of twenty-two, a professor of mathematics at the newly
established London University, later University College of the
University of London, where he continued to teach, except for short
periods following resignations prompted by cases of abridgement of
academic freedom. He always remained a champion of religious and
intellectual toleration, and he was equally a writer and a teacher of
exceptional ability. Many of his conundrums and witticisms were
collected in his well-known Budget of Paradoxes.</p>
<p>Peacock was something of a prophet in the development of abstract
algebra, and De Morgan was to him somewhat as Elisha was to Elijah. In
Peacock’s Algebra, the symbols were generally understood to be numbers
or magnitudes, but De Morgan would keep them abstract. He left without
meaning not only the letter that he used, but also the symbols of
operation; letters such as A, B, C might stand for virtues and vices and
+ and − might mean reward and punishment. De Morgan insisted that “with
one exception, no word or sign of arithmetic or algebra has one atom of
meaning throughout this chapter, the object of which is symbols and
their laws of combination, giving a symbolic algebra which may hereafter
become the grammar of a hundred distinct significant algebras.” (The
exception mentioned by De Morgan is the symbol of equality, for he
thought that in A = B, the symbols A and B must “have the same resulting
meaning, by whatever steps attained.”) This idea, expressed as early as
1830 in his Trigonometry and Double Algebra, comes close to the modern
recognition that mathematics deals with propositional functions, rather
than with propositions, but De Morgan seems not to have realized the
entirely arbitrary nature of the rules and the definitions of algebra.
He was sufficiently close to Kantian philosophy to believe that the
usual fundamental laws of algebra should apply to any algebraic system
whatsoever. He saw that in going from the “single algebra” of the real
number system to the “double algebra” of the complex numbers, the rules
of operation remain the same. And De Morgan believed that these two
forms exhaust the types of algebra that are possible and that a triple
or quadruple algebra could not be developed. In this important respect,
he was shown to be wrong by William Rowan Hamilton of Dublin. Another
mathematician of Trinity (Dublin) was George Salmon (1819–1904), who
taught both mathematics and divinity there and was the author of
excellent textbooks on conics, algebra, and analytic geometry.</p>
<p>William Rowan Hamilton</p>
<p>Hamilton’s father, a practicing attorney, and his mother, said to
have been intellectually gifted, both died while he was a boy, but even
before he was orphaned, the young Hamilton’s education had been
determined by an uncle who was a linguist. An extremely precocious
youngster, William read Greek, Hebrew, and Latin by the time he was
five; at the age of ten, he was acquainted with half a dozen oriental
languages. A meeting with a lightning calculator a few years later
perhaps spurred Hamilton’s already strong interest in mathematics, as
friendships with William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge probably
encouraged him to continue to produce the bad poetry he had been writing
since boyhood. Hamilton entered Trinity College, Dublin, and while still
an undergraduate there, at the age of twenty-two, he was appointed Royal
Astronomer of Ireland, director of the Dunsink Observatory, and
professor of astronomy. In the same year, he presented to the Irish
Academy a paper on systems of rays, in which he expressed one of his
favorite themes—that space and time are “indissolubly connected with
each other.” Perhaps Hamilton here was following in algebra the lead of
Newton, who, when he had difficulty defining abstract concepts in the
method of fluxions, felt more comfortable in appealing to the notion of
time in the physical universe. Possibly, he was simply concluding that
because geometry is the science of space, and space and time are the two
aspects of sensuous intuition, algebra should be the science of
time.</p>
<p>Shortly after he presented his first paper, Hamilton’s prediction of
conical refraction in certain crystals was experimentally confirmed by
physicists. This verification of a mathematical theory assured his
reputation, and at the age of thirty, he was knighted. Two years
earlier, in 1833, he had presented a long and significant paper before
the Irish Academy, in which he introduced a formal algebra of real
number couples, the rules of combination of which are precisely those
given today for the system of complex numbers. The important rule for
multiplication of the couples is, of course,</p>
<p>and he interpreted this product as an operation involving rotation.
Here one sees the definitive view of a complex number as an ordered pair
of real numbers, an idea that had been implied in the graphical
representations of Wessel, Argand, and Gauss but that now for the first
time was made explicit.</p>
<p>Hamilton realized that his ordered pairs could be thought of as
directed entities in the plane, and he naturally tried to extend the
idea to three dimensions by going from the binary complex number a + bi
to ordered number triples a + bi + cj. The operation of addition created
no difficulty, but for ten years, he was baffled by multiplication of
n-tuples for n greater than 2. One day in 1843, as he was walking with
his wife along the Royal Canal, he had a flash of inspiration: his
difficulty would vanish if he used quadruples instead of triples and if
he abandoned the commutative law for multiplication. It had been more or
less clear that for number quadruples a + bi + cj + dk, one should take
i2 = j2 = k2 = −1. Now Hamilton saw in addition that he should let ij =
k, but ji = −k, and, similarly, jk = −kj and ki = j = −ik. In other
respects, the laws of operation are as in ordinary algebra.</p>
<p>Just as Lobachevsky had created a new geometry consistent within
itself, by abandoning the parallel postulate, so Hamilton created a new
algebra, also consistent within itself, by discarding the commutative
postulate for multiplication. He stopped in his walk, and, with a knife,
he cut the fundamental formula i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk on a stone of Brougham
Bridge; the same day, October 16, he asked the Royal Irish Academy for
leave to read a paper on quaternions at the next session. The key
discovery was sudden, but the discoverer had been working toward it for
some fifteen years. Hamilton, quite naturally, always regarded the
discovery of quaternions as his greatest achievement. In retrospect, it
is clear that it was not so much this particular type of algebra that
was significant, but rather the discovery of the tremendous freedom that
mathematics enjoys to build algebras that need not satisfy the
restrictions imposed by the so-called fundamental laws, which up to that
time, supported by the vague principle of permanence of form, had been
invoked without exception. For the last twenty years of his life,
Hamilton spent his energies on his favorite algebra, which he was
inclined to imbue with cosmic significance and which some British
mathematicians regarded as a kind of Leibnizian arithmetica universalis.
His Lectures on Quaternions appeared in 1853. Much of this bulky work is
devoted to applications of quaternions to geometry, differential
geometry, and physics. Of primary significance for the history of modern
algebra is the fact that Hamilton here presented a detailed theory of a
noncommutative algebraic system.</p>
<p>Among the basic concepts discussed in the book are those of vectors
and scalars. The quaternion units i, j, and k were variously described
as operators and as coordinates. Generally, Hamilton treated quaternions
as vectors and essentially showed that they form a linear vector space
over the real number field. He defined the addition of quaternions and
introduced the notion of two types of products, obtained by multiplying
a vector by a scalar or by another vector, respectively; he observed
that the first is associative, distributive, and commutative, whereas
the latter is only associative and distributive. He also discussed the
inner product (“scalar product”) of two vectors and demonstrated its
bilinearity.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Hamilton devoted himself to the preparation of the
enlarged Elements of Quaternions. This was not quite completed when he
died in 1865, but it was edited and published by his son in the
following year. It is gratifying for Americans to recall that in those
unhappy years of civil strife, the newly established National Academy of
Sciences named Sir William Rowan Hamilton its first foreign
associate.</p>
<p>Grassmann and Ausdehnungslehre</p>
<p>The concept of an n-dimensional vector space had received detailed
treatment in Hermann Grassmann’s Ausdehnungslehre, published in Germany
in 1844. Grassmann (1809–1877), a secondary schoolteacher, was also led
to his results by studying the geometric interpretation of negative
quantities and the addition and the multiplication of directed line
segments in two and three dimensions. He emphasized the dimension
concept and stressed the development of an abstract science of “spaces”
and “subspaces” that would include the geometry of two and three
dimensions as special cases. It is interesting to note that Grassmann,
like Hamilton, was a linguist, being a specialist in Sanskrit
literature. His father, Justus Grassmann, had belonged to the so-called
combinatorial school of German mathematicians at the beginning of the
century. This undoubtedly affected his views on the nature of
mathematics. Grassmann defined pure mathematics as the science of forms
(Formenlehre), stressing the difference between this view and that which
regards mathematics merely as the science of quantities. The concepts
basic to his science of forms are those of equality and combination,
which he denoted by = and ∩, respectively. He defined the inverse, ∪ of
∩, by stating that a ∪ b is the form that satisfies a ∪ b ∩ b = b ∩ a.
The science of extension is “the abstract foundation of geometry,” freed
from spatial conceptualizations and restriction to three dimensions. A
single element generates a one-dimensional space (einstufiges System);
the set of elements derived from a given element by a constant change
gives a two-dimensional space, corresponding to lines in geometry.
Generally,</p>
<p>if all elements of an n-dimensional domain are subjected to one and
the same kind of change which leads to new elements (not contained in
the domain), then the totality of the elements generated by this change
and its inverse is called a domain of dimension n + 1.</p>
<p>This definition was made more precise in the revised 1862 edition of
Grassmann’s Ausdehnungslehre, where he elaborated on the concepts of
linear dependence and independence of vectors and discussed subspaces,
their unions and intersections, and spanning sets. He also stated
theorems equivalent to the proposition that if S and T are two subspaces
of a vector space V, then d[S] + d[T] = d[S ∪ T] + d[S ∩ T], where d[S]
represents the dimension of S, and S ∪ T, S ∩ T the union and the
intersection of S and T, respectively.</p>
<p>Grassmann laid great stress on the different kinds of multiplication
that arose in the Ausdehnungslehre. He distinguished between “inner” and
“outer” or “combinatorial” products. In the particular case treated by
Hamilton, these reduce to the latter’s scalar and vector products. Other
types of multiplication treated by Grassmann included “algebraic”
products, namely, those where ab − ba, as in common algebra, and “outer”
products, which correspond to matrix products. One could translate many
details of Grassmann’s work into the language of modern abstract vector
space theory; suffice it to say that using the basic concepts cited
previously, Grassmann showed how an n-dimensional system containing
various new operations could be established, which for special cases
reduced to more familiar mathematical structures.</p>
<p>The significance of the Ausdehnungslehre was slow to be recognized,
for the book was not only unconventional but difficult to read. One
reason was that Grassmann, like Desargues before him, used a very
unconventional terminology; more fundamental was the novelty and extreme
generality of the author’s approach to the question of extension.</p>
<p>Largely under the urging of Möbius, Grassmann not only revised the
Ausdehnungslehre but also published various articles in Crelle’s
Journal, in which he summarized some of his basic results. It was
through these articles that most mathematicians became acquainted with
the substance of his work.</p>
<p>Word of the Ausdehnungslehre began to spread after the publication in
1867 of Hermann Hankel’s work on systems of complex numbers. Hankel, a
student of Riemann’s, attempted to present a rigorous introduction to
complex numbers. His work, which reflected study of Grassmann, referred
to Peacock, gave the first German account of Hamilton’s quaternions, and
presented a theory of “alternating numbers” equivalent to Grassmann’s
outer products. Among those whose attention was drawn to Grassmann’s
work through Hankel’s book was Felix Klein. He wrote to F. Engel in
1911:</p>
<p>As is well known, Grassmann in his Ausdehnungslehre is an affine,
rather than a projective, geometer. This became clear to me in the late
fall of 1871 and (besides the study of Möbius and Hamilton and the
working out of all the impressions I had received in Paris) led to my
conception of my later Erlanger Program.</p>
<p>In England, William K. Clifford championed Grassmann’s cause; in the
United States, the Ausdehnungslehre supported the development, primarily
through the efforts of a Yale University physicist, Josiah Willard Gibbs
(1839–1903), of the more limited algebra of vectors in three-dimensional
space. The algebra of vectors is again a multiple algebra in which the
commutative law for multiplication fails to hold. In fact, it was proved
in 1867 by Hankel that the algebra of complex numbers is, as De Morgan
suspected, the most general algebra that is possible under the
fundamental laws of arithmetic. The Vector Analysis of Gibbs appeared in
1881 and again in 1884, and he published further articles during the
decade. These works led to a spirited and not-too-genteel controversy
with the proponents of quaternions over the relative merits of the two
algebras. In 1895, a colleague of Gibbs’s at Yale organized an
International Association for Promoting the Study of Quaternions and
Allied Systems of Mathematics, of which the first president was a rabid
supporter of quaternions. It was not long before allied systems (such as
vectors and their generalization, tensors) for a time eclipsed
quaternions, but today they have a recognized place in algebra, as well
as in quantum theory. Moreover, although Hamilton’s name is infrequently
linked with vectors, because Gibbs’s notations came mostly from
Grassmann, the chief properties of vectors had nevertheless been worked
out in Hamilton’s protracted investigations in multiple algebras.</p>
<p>Cayley and Sylvester</p>
<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century, German mathematicians stood
head and shoulders above those of other nationalities in analysis and
geometry, with the universities of Berlin and Göttingen in the lead and
with publication centering on Crelle’s Journal. Algebra, on the other
hand, was for a while almost a British monopoly, with Trinity College,
Cambridge, in the forefront and the Cambridge Mathematical Journal as
the chief medium of publication. Peacock and De Morgan were from
Trinity, as was Cayley, a heavy contributor to both algebra and
geometry, who had graduated as senior wrangler. We have noted Cayley’s
work in analytic geometry, especially in connection with the use of
determinants, but Cayley was also one of the first men to study
matrices, another instance of the British concern for form and structure
in algebra. This work grew out of a memoir of 1858 on the theory of
transformations. If, for example, we follow the transformation</p>
<p>by another transformation,</p>
<p>then the result (which had appeared earlier, for example, in the
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of Gauss in 1801) is equivalent to the
single composite transformation</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we reverse the order of T1 and T2, so that T2
is the transformation</p>
<p>and T1 is the transformation</p>
<p>then these two, applied successively, are equivalent to the single
transformation</p>
<p>Reversing the order of the transformations in general gives a
different result. Expressed in the language of matrices,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>In as much as two matrices are equal, if and only if all
corresponding elements are equal, it is clear that once again we have an
instance of noncommutative multiplication.</p>
<p>The definition of multiplication of matrices is as indicated
previously, and the sum of two matrices (of the same dimensions) is
defined as the matrix obtained by adding the corresponding elements of
the matrices. Thus,</p>
<p>Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar K is defined by the
equation</p>
<p>The matrix</p>
<p>which is usually denoted by I, leaves every square matrix of second
order invariant under multiplication; hence, it is called the identity
matrix under multiplication. The only matrix leaving another such matrix
invariant under addition is, of course, the zero matrix</p>
<p>which, consequently, is the identity matrix under addition. With
these definitions, we can think of the operations on matrices as
constituting an “algebra,” a step that was taken by Cayley and the
American mathematicians Benjamin Peirce (1809–1880) and his son Charles
S. Peirce (1839–1914). The Peirces somewhat played the role in America
that Hamilton, Grassmann, and Cayley had filled in Europe. The study of
matrix algebra and of other noncommutative algebras has everywhere been
one of the chief factors in the development of an increasingly abstract
view of algebra, especially in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Shortly after receiving his degree at Trinity, Cayley took to the law
for fourteen years; this interfered little with his mathematical
research, and he published several hundred papers during these years.
Many of the papers were in the theory of algebraic invariants, a field
in which he and his friend James Joseph Sylvester (1814–1897) were
preeminent. Cayley and Sylvester were a study in contrasts, the former
being mild and even-tempered, the latter mercurial and impatient. Both
were Cambridge men—Cayley at Trinity, Sylvester at St. John’s—but
Sylvester was ineligible for a degree because he was a Jew. For three
years following 1838, Sylvester had taught at University College,
London, where he was a colleague of his former teacher De Morgan; after
this, he accepted a professorship at the University of Virginia.
Discipline problems so upset the temperamental mathematician that he
left precipitately after only three months. When he returned to England,
he spent almost ten years in business and then turned to the study of
law, in connection with which, in 1850, he first met Cayley. The two men
were ever afterward friends and mathematicians, and, ultimately, both
left the law. In 1854, Sylvester took a position at the Royal Military
Academy at Woolwich, and in 1863, Cayley accepted the Sadlerian
professorship at Cambridge. In 1876, Sylvester had one more fling at
teaching in America, this time at the newly established Johns Hopkins
University, where he remained until he was almost seventy, when he
accepted a professorship offered him by Oxford University. In 1881,
while Sylvester was still at Johns Hopkins, Cayley accepted an
invitation to deliver there a series of lectures on Abelian and theta
functions. Although Cayley’s papers, which rival those of Euler and
Cauchy in number, are predominantly in algebra and geometry, he did also
contribute to analysis, and his only book, published in 1876, is a
Treatise on Elliptic Functions.</p>
<p>Cayley’s interests were divided, but Sylvester’s loyalty to algebra
was firm, and it is fitting that his name is attached to what is known
as Sylvester’s dialytic method in eliminating an unknown from two
polynomial equations. The device is a simple one and consists of
multiplying one or both of the two equations by the unknown quantity to
be eliminated, repeating the process if necessary until the total number
of equations is 1 greater than the number of powers of the unknown. From
this set of n + 1 equations, one can then eliminate all of the n powers,
thinking of each power as a different unknown. Thus, to eliminate x from
the pair of equations x2 + ax + b = 0 and x3 + cx2 + dx + e = 0, one
multiplies the first by x and then multiplies the resulting equation,
and also the second equation above, by x. Then, thinking of each of the
four powers of x as a separate unknown, the determinant</p>
<p>known as the resultant in Sylvester’s method, when equated to zero
gives the result of the elimination.</p>
<p>More important than his work in elimination was Sylvester’s
collaboration with Cayley in the development of the theory of “forms”
(or “quantics,” as Cayley preferred to call them), through which the men
came to be known as “invariant twins.” Between 1854 and 1878, Sylvester
published almost a dozen papers on forms—homogeneous polynomials in two
or more variables—and their invariants. The most important cases in
analytic geometry and physics are the quadratic forms in two and three
variables, for, when equated to a constant, these represent conics and
quadrics. In particular, the quantic or form Ax2 + 2Bxy + Cy2, when
equated to a nonzero constant, represents an ellipse (real or
imaginary), a parabola, or a hyperbola according as B2 − AC is less
than, equal to, or greater than zero. Moreover, if the form is
transformed under a rotation of axes about the origin into the new form
A′x2 + 2B′xy + C′y2, then (B′)2 − A′C′ = B2 − AC, that is, the
expression B2 − AC, known as the characteristic of the form, is an
invariant under such a transformation. The expression A + C is another
invariant. Still other important invariants associated with the form are
the roots k1 and k2 of the characteristic equation</p>
<p>These roots are, in fact, the coefficients of x2 and y2 in the
canonical form k1x2 + k2y2 to which the form, if not of parabolic type,
can be reduced through a rotation of axes. The effervescent Sylvester
boasted that he had discovered and developed the reduction of binary
forms to canonical form at one sitting “with a decanter of port wine to
sustain nature’s flagging energies.”</p>
<p>If we designate by M the matrix of coefficients of the form and by I
the identity matrix of order two, the characteristic equation can be
written as |M − kI| = 0, where the vertical lines represent the
determinant of the matrix. One of the important properties of the
algebra of matrices is that a matrix M satisfies its characteristic
equation, a result given in 1858 and known as the Hamilton-Cayley
theorem. It is sometimes held that Cayley’s algebra of matrices was an
outcome of Hamilton’s algebra of quaternions, but in 1894, Cayley
specifically denied such a link. He admired the theory of quaternions,
but he asserted that his development of matrices stemmed from that of
determinants as a convenient mode of expressing a transformation. In
fact, Cayley’s publication of 1858 reflects not only the influence of
Hamilton’s quaternions but Cayley’s concern with the issues raised by
the operational calculus of the day. These two factors are also evident
in an earlier publication (1845), in which he had provided an example of
a nonassociative algebra.</p>
<p>Linear Associative Algebras</p>
<p>It was the classification of linear associative algebras that marks
the beginning of contributions by Americans to modern algebra. Benjamin
Peirce, for many years affiliated with the U.S. Coast Survey, as well as
a professor of mathematics at his alma mater, Harvard, presented this
work to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in the 1860s and had
it printed with limited circulation in 1870. It only became generally
known in a version that appeared posthumously, in the American Journal
of Mathematics in 1881, with ample notes and addenda by his son Charles
S. Peirce, who had also contributed basic ideas to the original paper.
Linear associative algebras include ordinary algebra, vector analysis,
and quaternions as special cases but are not restricted to the units 1,
i, j, k. Peirce worked out multiplication tables for 162 algebras. C. S.
Peirce continued his father’s work in this direction by showing that of
all of these algebras, there are only three in which division is
uniquely defined: ordinary real algebra, the algebra of complex numbers,
and the algebra of quaternions.</p>
<p>It was in connection with his work on linear associative algebra that
in 1870, Benjamin Peirce gave the well-known definition “Mathematics is
the science which draws necessary conclusions.” His son was in
wholehearted agreement with this view, as a result of Boole’s influence,
but he stressed that mathematics and logic are not the same.
“Mathematics is purely hypothetical: it produces nothing but conditional
propositions. Logic, on the contrary, is categorical in its assertions.”
This distinction was to be argued further throughout the mathematical
world in the first half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In England, somewhat similar ideas were pursued by William Kingdon
Clifford (1845–1879), yet another Trinity graduate, whose brilliant
work, like that of an earlier Trinity graduate, Roger Cotes, was cut
short by premature death in his thirty-fourth year. Clifford was
extraordinary in several respects. For one thing, he was a gymnast who
could pull himself up on the bar with either hand—a most unusual feat
for anyone and especially almost unheard of for one who graduated as
second wrangler. Also, like the Oxford mathematician C. L. Dodgson
(1832–1898), better known as Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in
Wonderland, Clifford composed The Little People, a collection of tales
for children. In 1870, Clifford wrote a paper, “On the Space-Theory of
Matter,” in which he showed himself to be a staunch British supporter of
the non-Euclidean geometry of Lobachevsky and Riemann. In algebra,
Clifford also espoused the newer views, and his name is perpetuated
today in the so-called Clifford algebras, of which octonions or
biquaternions are special cases. These noncommutative algebras were used
by Clifford to study motions in non-Euclidean spaces, certain manifolds
of which are known as spaces of Clifford and Klein. How different was
the progressive British mathematics of the latter part of the nineteenth
century from the stultifyingly conservative views at the opening of the
century!</p>
<p>Algebraic Geometry</p>
<p>In 1882, two works appeared that, in hindsight, foreshadowed
important twentieth-century trends. One was a deep study by Leopold
Kronecker dealing with an arithmetic theory of algebraic quantities.
This difficult paper had a pronounced impact on algebraists and number
theorists at the turn of the century. The other work was a joint memoir
by Richard Dedekind (1831–1916) and Heinrich Weber (1842–1913) on the
theory of algebraic functions. Dedekind and Weber used the algebraic
theory developed by the former in his treatment of algebraic numbers to
strip Riemann’s work on function theory from its geometric
underpinnings. This allowed them to define parts of a Riemann surface
algebraically in such a way that it could be considered invariant with
respect to an algebraic function field. The purely algebraic approach
opened up an entirely new avenue for post-Riemannian algebraic geometry;
indeed, it turned out to be one of the most fruitful paths pursued by
twentieth-century investigators. Almost half a century would pass before
this became apparent, however.</p>
<p>Algebraic and Arithmetic Integers</p>
<p>The work of Galois had been important not only in making the abstract
notion of group fundamental in the theory of equations, but also in
leading, through the contributions of Dedekind, Kronecker, and Ernst
Eduard Kummer, to what may be called an arithmetical approach to
algebra, somewhat akin to the arithmetization of analysis. This means
the development of a careful postulational treatment of algebraic
structure in terms of various number fields. The concept of field was
implicit in work by Abel and Galois, but in 1879, Dedekind seems to have
been the first one to give an explicit definition of a number field—a
set of numbers that form an Abelian group with respect to addition and
with respect to multiplication (except for the inverse of zero) and for
which multiplication distributes over addition. Simple examples are the
system of rational numbers, the real number system, and the complex
number field. In 1881, Kronecker gave other instances through his
domains of rationality. The set of numbers of the form , where a and b
are rational, form a field, as is easily verified. In this case, the
number of elements in the field is infinite. A field with a finite
number of elements is known as a Galois field, and a simple instance of
this is the field of integers modulo 5 (or any prime).</p>
<p>The concern for structure and the rise of new algebras, especially
during the second half of the nineteenth century, led to broad
generalizations about number and arithmetic. We have already noted that
Gauss extended the idea of integer through the study of Gaussian
integers of the form a + bi, where a and b are integers. Dedekind
generalized further in the theory of “algebraic integers”—numbers
satisfying a polynomial equation with integral coefficients that have
leading coefficient unity. Such systems of “integers” do not, of course,
form a field, for inverses under multiplication are lacking. They do
have something in common, in that they satisfy the other requirements
for a number field; they are thus said to form an “integral domain.”
Such generalizations of the word “integer” are, however, bought at a
price—the loss of unique factorization. Therefore, Dedekind, adapting
ideas developed by the contemporary mathematician Ernst Eduard Kummer
(1810–1893), introduced into arithmetic the concept of an “ideal.”</p>
<p>A set of elements is said to form a ring if (1) it is an Abelian
group with respect to addition, (2) the set is closed under
multiplication, and (3) multiplication is associative and is
distributive over addition. (Hence, a ring that is commutative under
multiplication has a unit element and has no divisors of zero is an
integral domain.) An ideal, then, is a subset I of elements of a ring R
that (1) form an additive group and (2) are such that whenever x belongs
to R and y belongs to I, then xy belong to I. The set of even integers,
for example, is an ideal in the ring of integers. It turns out that in
the ring (or integral domain) R of algebraic integers, any ideal I of R
can be represented uniquely (except for the order of the factors) as a
product of prime ideals. That is, uniqueness of factorization can be
saved through the theory of ideals.</p>
<p>Kummer earned his doctorate at the University of Halle. After about a
dozen years of teaching in gymnasia, he succeeded Dirichlet at Berlin
when, in 1855, the latter became Gauss’s successor at Göttingen; Kummer
remained there until his retirement in 1883. Shortly after earning his
degree, Kummer had become interested in Fermat’s Last Theorem. Kummer
was able to prove the theorem for a large class of exponents, but a
general proof eluded him. The stumbling block seems to have been the
fact that in the factoring of xn + yn, through the solution of xn + yn =
0 for x in terms of y, the algebraic integers, or roots of the equation,
do not necessarily satisfy the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic; that
is, they are not uniquely factorable. The result was that although he
failed to solve Fermat’s theorem, in the attempt to do so he created, in
a sense, a new arithmetic. This was a theory, not of our ideals, but of
devices that he called “ideal complex numbers.” One of the lessons that
the history of mathematics teaches is that the search for solutions to
unsolved problems, whether solvable or unsolvable, invariably leads to
important discoveries along the way.</p>
<p>Dedekind’s concern with algebra goes back to the 1850s, when he
attended Dirichlet’s lectures on number theory in Göttingen and pursued
intensive studies of Galois theory. His notes of the period show that he
developed an abstract treatment of elementary group theory at that time.
After Dirichlet’s death, Dedekind was charged with publishing
Dirichlet’s lectures on number theory. In appendices to that work, he
presented a number of results of his own. Best known among these was his
ideal theory, various versions of which can be compared in the
successive editions of Dirichlet-Dedekind. The most axiomatic approach,
which appeared in the 1894 edition, was the one that especially
influenced Emmy Noether and her school of algebraists in the 1920s.</p>
<p>In 1897 and 1900, Dedekind also published two memoirs on a new
structure he called a “dual group.” In the first of these memoirs, the
modern reader easily recognizes a set of axioms for a lattice. In the
second, devoted to a study of the free modular lattice with three
generators, Dedekind showed that a lattice forms a partially ordered
set. Here the reader also finds the important concepts of a covering
relation and of the dimension of a lattice. Dedekind also utilized chain
conditions.</p>
<p>During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, numerous other
abstract and often axiomatic treatments of groups and fields were
published. Several of these were instigated by Dedekind; this is true
particularly of the work of Heinrich Weber, whom Dedekind interested in
algebra.</p>
<p>Axioms of Arithmetic</p>
<p>Mathematics has often been likened to a tree, for it grows through an
ever more widely spreading and branching structure above ground, while,
at the same time, it sinks its roots ever deeper and wider in the search
for a firm foundation. This double growth was especially characteristic
of the development of analysis in the nineteenth century, for the rapid
expansion of the theory of functions had been accompanied by the
rigorous arithmetization of the subject from Bolzano to Weierstrass. In
algebra, the nineteenth century had been more notable for new
developments than for attention to foundations, and Peacock’s efforts to
provide a sound basis were feeble in comparison with the precision of
Bolzano in analysis. During the closing years of the century, however,
there were several efforts to provide stronger roots for algebra. The
complex number system is defined in terms of the real numbers, which are
explained as classes of rational numbers, which in turn are ordered
pairs of integers. But what, after all, are the integers? Everyone
thinks that he or she knows, for example, what the number 3 is—until he
or she tries to define or explain it—and the idea of equality of
integers is assumed to be obvious. Not satisfied to leave the basic
concepts of arithmetic, hence of algebra, in so vague a state, the
German logician and mathematician F.L.G. Frege (1848–1925) was led to
his well-known definition of a cardinal number. The basis for his views
came from the theory of sets of Boole and Cantor. It will be recalled
that Cantor had regarded two infinite sets as having the same “power” if
the elements of the sets can be put into one-to-one correspondence.
Frege saw that this idea of the correspondence of elements is also basic
in the notion of equality of integers. Two finite sets are said to have
the same cardinal number—that is, to be equal—if the elements in either
class can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the elements in the
other. If, then, one were to begin with an initial set, such as the set
of fingers on the normal human hand, and were to form the much more
comprehensive set of all sets the elements of which can be put into
one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the initial set, then
this set of all such sets would constitute a cardinal number, in this
case the number 5. More generally, Frege’s definition of the cardinal
number of a given class, whether finite or infinite, is the class of all
classes that are similar to the given class (where by “similar,” one
means that the elements of the two classes in question can be placed in
one-to-one correspondence).</p>
<p>Frege’s definition of a cardinal number appeared in 1884 in a
well-known book, Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik (The Foundations of
Arithmetic), and from the definition, he derived the properties of the
whole numbers that are familiar in grade-school arithmetic. During the
succeeding years, Frege amplified his views in the two-volume
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic), the first volume
of which appeared in 1893 and the second, ten years later. As the second
volume was in press, however, Frege received a letter from Bertrand
Russell informing him of the paradox concerning the class of all classes
that are not members of themselves. Frege, recognizing the implication
for his definition of cardinal numbers and the entire work he had just
completed, appended a note to his volume commenting on the blow to a
scholar when the foundation of an entire structure he has established is
pulled out from underneath.</p>
<p>Frege undertook to derive the concepts of arithmetic from those of
formal logic, for he disagreed with the assertion of C. S. Peirce that
mathematics and logic are clearly distinct. Frege had been educated at
the universities of Jena and Göttingen, and he taught at Jena during a
long career. Nevertheless, his program did not meet with much response
until it was undertaken independently early in the twentieth century by
Bertrand Russell, when it became one of the chief goals of
mathematicians. Frege was keenly disappointed by the poor reception of
his work, but the fault lay in part in the excessively novel and
philosophical form in which the results were cast. History shows that
novelty in ideas is more readily accepted if couched in a relatively
conventional form.</p>
<p>Italy had taken a somewhat less active part in the development of
abstract algebra than had France, Germany, and England, but during the
closing years of the nineteenth century, there were Italian
mathematicians who took a deep interest in mathematical logic. Best
known of these was Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), whose name is recalled
today in connection with the Peano axioms on which so many rigorous
constructions of algebra and analysis depend. His aim was similar to
that of Frege, but it was at the same time more ambitious and yet more
down to earth. He hoped, in his Formulaire de mathématiques (1894 et
seq.), to develop a formalized language that should contain not only
mathematical logic but all of the most important branches of
mathematics. That his program attracted a large circle of collaborators
and disciples resulted in part from his avoidance of metaphysical
language and from his felicitous choice of symbols—such as ∈ (belongs to
the class of), ∪ (logical sum or union), ∩ (logical product or
intersection), and ⊃ (contains)—many of which are used even today. For
his foundations of arithmetic, he chose three primitive concepts: zero,
number (that is, nonnegative whole number), and the relationship “is the
successor of,” satisfying five postulates:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Zero is a number.</p></li>
<li><p>If a is a number, the successor of a is a number.</p></li>
<li><p>Zero is not the successor of a number.</p></li>
<li><p>Two numbers of which the successors are equal are themselves
equal.</p></li>
<li><p>If a set S of numbers contains zero and also the successor of
every number in S, then every number is in S.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The last requirement is, of course, the axiom of induction. The Peano
axioms, first formulated in 1889 in Arithmetices principia nova methodo
exposita, represent the most striking attempt of the century to reduce
common arithmetic—hence, ultimately, most of mathematics—to the stark
essentials of formal symbolism. (He expressed the postulates in symbols,
rather than in the words that we have used.) Here the postulational
method attained a new height of precision, with no ambiguity of meaning
and no concealed assumptions. Peano also spent much effort in the
development of symbolic logic, a favorite pursuit of the twentieth
century.</p>
<p>A further contribution by Peano to mathematics should perhaps be
mentioned, inasmuch as it represented one of the disquieting discoveries
of the time. The nineteenth century had opened with a recognition that
curves and functions need not be of the well-behaved type that had
theretofore preempted the field, and in 1890, Peano showed how
thoroughly mathematics could outrage common sense when he constructed
continuous space-filling curves, that is, curves given by parametric
equations x = f(t), y = g(t), where f and g are continuous real
functions in the interval 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, the points of which completely fill
the unit square 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1. This paradox, of course, is all of
a piece with Cantor’s discovery that there are no more points in a unit
square than in a unit line segment, and it was among the factors that
caused the following century to devote much more attention to the basic
structure of mathematics. In 1903, Peano himself, however, was
distracted by his invention of the international language that he called
“Interlingua” or “Latino sine flexione,” with vocabulary drawn from
Latin, French, English, and German. This movement turned out to be far
more ephemeral than his axiomatic structure in arithmetic.</p>
