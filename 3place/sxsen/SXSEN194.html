<h4 id="dalembert">D’Alembert</h4>
<p>Like Euler and the Bernoullis, Jean Le Rond d’Alembert (1717 1783),
too, was broadly educated—in law, medicine, science, and mathematics—a
background that served him well when, from 1751 to 1772, he collaborated
with Denis Diderot (1713 1784) in the twenty-eight volumes of the
celebrated Encyclopedie´ or Dictionnaire raisonne des´ sciences, des
arts, et des metiers´ . For the Encyclopedie´ , d’Alembert wrote the
much-admired “Discours preliminaire,” as well as most of the
mathematical and scientific articles. The Encyclopedie´ , despite
d’Alembert’s Jansenist education, showed strong tendencies toward the
secularization of learning so characteristic of the Enlightenment, and
it met with strong attack from Jesuits. Through his defense of the
project, d’Alembert became known as “the fox of the Encyclopedia” and
incidentally played a significant role in the expulsion of the Jesuit
order from France. As a result of his activities and his friendships
with Voltaire and others among the Philosophes, he was one of those who
paved the way for the French Revolution. At the early age of
twenty-four, he had been elected to the Academie des Sciences, and in
1754, he became its´ secretaire perpetuel´ , and as such, perhaps the
most influential scientist in France.</p>
<p>While Euler was busy with mathematical research in Berlin, d’Alembert
was active in Paris. Until 1757, when controversy over the problem of
vibrating strings brought estrangement, correspondence between the two
wasfrequentandcordial,fortheirinterestsweremuchthesame.Statements such
as log(21)2 5log(11)2, equivalent to 2 log(21)52 log(11) or to
log(2l)5log(1l), had puzzled the best mathematicians of the earlier part
of the eighteenth century, but, as noted in the previous chapter, by
1747, Euler was able to write to d’Alembert correctly explaining the
status of logarithms of negative numbers.</p>
<p>D’Alembert had spent much of his time and effort attempting to prove
the theorem conjectured by Girard and known today as the fundamental
theorem of algebra—that every polynomial equation f(x)50, having complex
coefficients and of degree n, has at least one complex root. So earnest
were his efforts to prove the theorem (especially in a prize essay on
“The General Cause of Winds,” published in the Memoirs of the Berlin
Academy for 1746) that in France today, the theorem is widely known as
the theorem of d’Alembert. If we think of the solution of such a
polynomial equation as a generalization of the explicit algebraic
operations, we can say that in essence, d’Alembert wished to show that
the result of any algebraic operation performed on a complex number is
in turn a complex number. In a paper of 1752 on the resistance of
fluids, he arrived at the so-called Cauchy-Riemann equations that loom
so large in complex analysis.</p>
<p>Limits</p>
<p>D’Alembert was an unusual combination of caution and boldness in his
view of mathematical developments. He regarded Euler’s use of divergent
series as open to suspicion (1768), despite the successes achieved.
Moreover, d’Alembert objected to the Eulerian assumption that
differentials are symbols for quantities that are zero and yet
qualitatively different. Inasmuch as Euler restricted himself to
well-behaved functions, he had not become involved in the subtle
difficulties that later were to make his naive position untenable.
Meanwhile, d’Alembert believed that the “true metaphysics” of the
calculus was to be found in the idea of a limit. In the article on the
“differential” that he wrote for the Encyclopedie´ , d’Alembert stated
that “the differentiation of equations consists simply in finding the
limits of the ratio of finite differences of two variables included in
the equation.” Opposing the views of Leibniz and Euler, d’Alembert
insisted that “a quantity is something or nothing; if it is something,
it has not yet vanished; if it is nothing, it has literally vanished.
The supposition that there is an intermediate state between these two is
a chimera.” This view would rule out the vague notion of differentials
as infinitely small magnitudes, and d’Alembert held that the
differential notation is merely a convenient manner of speaking that
depends for its justification on the language of limits. His
Encyclopedie´ article on the differential referred to Newton’s De
Quadratura Curvarum, but d’Alembert interpreted Newton’s phrase “prime
and ultimate ratio” as a limit, rather than as a first or last ratio of
two quantities just springing into being. In the article on “Limit” that
he composed for the Encyclopedie´ , he called one quantity the limit of
a second</p>
<p>B ez out´</p>
<p>(variable) quantity if the second can approach the first nearer than
by any given quantity (without actually coinciding with it). The
imprecision in this
definitionwasremovedintheworksofnineteenth-centurymathematicians.</p>
<p>Euler had thought of an infinitely large quantity as the reciprocal
of an infinitely small magnitude, but d’Alembert, having outlawed the
infinitesimal, defined the indefinitely large in terms of limits. A
line, for example, is said to be infinite with respect to another if
their ratio is greater than any given number. He went on to define
indefinitely large quantities of higher order in a manner similar to
that used by mathematicians today in speaking of orders of infinity with
respect to functions. D’Alembert denied the existence of the actually
infinite, for he was thinking of geometric magnitudes, rather than of
the theory of aggregates proposed a century later.</p>
