<h4 id="jordanus-nemorarius">Jordanus Nemorarius</h4>
<p>It will be clear from the few illustrations we have given that
Fibonacci was an unusually capable mathematician. It is true that he had
no worthy rival during the 900 years of medieval European culture, but
he was not quite the isolated figure he is sometimes held to be. He had
an able, though less gifted, younger contemporary in Jordanus Nemorarius
(1225 1260). Jordanus Nemorarius, or Jordanus de Nemore, represents a
more Aristotelian aspect of science than others we have met in the
thirteenth century, and he became the founder of what is sometimes known
as the medieval school of mechanics. To him, we owe the first correct
formulation of the law of the inclined plane, a law that the ancients
had sought in vain: the force along an oblique path is inversely
proportional to the obliquity, where obliquity is measured by the ratio
of a given segment of the oblique path to the amount of the vertical
intercepted by that path, that is, the “run” over the “rise.” In the
language of trigonometry, this means that F:W51/csc θ, which is
equivalent to</p>
<p>C amp anus of No vara</p>
<p>the modern formulation F5W sin θ, where W is weight, F is force, and
θ is the angle of inclination.</p>
<p>Jordanus was the author of books on arithmetic, geometry, and
astronomy, as well as mechanics. His Arithmetica, in particular, was the
basis of popular commentaries at the University of Paris as late as the
sixteenth century; this was not a book on computation but a
quasiphilosophical work in the tradition of Nicomachus and Boethius. It
contains such theoretical results as the theorem that any multiple of a
perfect number is abundant and that a divisor of a perfect number is
deficient. The Arithmetica is especially significant for the use of
letters instead of numerals as numbers, thus making possible the
statement of general algebraic theorems. In the arithmetical theorems in
Euclid’s Elements VII IX, numbers had been represented by line segments
to which letters had been attached, and the geometric proofs in
al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra made use of lettered diagrams, but all
coefficients in the equations used in the Algebra are specific numbers,
whether represented by numerals or written out in words. The idea of
generality is implied in al-Khwarizmi’s exposition, but he had no scheme
for expressing algebraically the general propositions that are so
readily available in geometry.</p>
<p>In the Arithmetica, the use of letters suggests the concept of
“parameter,” but Jordanus’s successors generally overlooked his scheme
of letters. They seem to have been more interested in the Arabic aspects
of algebra found in another Jordanian work, De numeris datis, a
collection of algebraic rules for finding, from a given number, other
numbers related to it according to certain conditions, or for showing
that a number satisfying specific restrictions is determined. A typical
instance is the following: if a given number is divided into two parts
such that the product of one part by the other is given, then each of
the two parts is necessarily determined.</p>
<p>It is greatly to his credit that he first stated the rule, equivalent
to the solution of a quadratic equation, completely in general form.
Only later did he provide a specific example of it, expressed in Roman
numerals: to divide the number X into two parts the product of which is
to be XXI, Jordanus follows through the steps indicated previously to
find that the parts are III and VII.</p>
